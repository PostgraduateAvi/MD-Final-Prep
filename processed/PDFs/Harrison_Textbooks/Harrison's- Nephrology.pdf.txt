Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tract

PART 9

308

Approach to the Patient  
with Renal Disease or  
Urinary Tract Disease
Julian L. Seifter

The upper urinary tract consists of the kidneys, their vasculature, and 
the  renal  parenchyma  and  its  collecting  system.  The  lower  urinary 
tract is composed of the peristaltic ureters from each kidney, the blad-
der which receives and stores urine from each ureter, and the urethra 
which, upon bladder contraction, excretes the final urine. The excre-
tory  system  as  a  whole  begins  with  a  plasma  ultrafiltrate  from  renal 
cortical glomeruli, modified by the renal tubules of the nephron, and 
ends with the excretion of urinary water and solutes.

Disease  can  occur  at  any  level  of  these  functional  structures  with 
either no symptoms or signs (such as an incidental renal mass picked 
up  on  ultrasound);  with  nonspecific  findings  (such  as  fatigue);  with 
signs highly specific for a syndrome of dysfunction referable to a struc-
ture,  but  not  diagnostic  of  a  particular  disease  (such  as  proteinuria); 
or with a finding highly characteristic of a specific diagnosis (such as 
polycystic kidney disease). Disorders of the kidney presenting without 
symptoms (such as invisible microhematuria or a stone) are often dis-
covered by laboratory testing or imaging.

It  is  important  to  perform  renal  testing  in  patients  with  systemic 
disease  (for  example,  routine  screening  for  albuminuria  in  diabetes 
mellitus  [DM]).  Likewise,  one  should  look  at  renal  function  when  a 
patient’s  history  includes  known  risk  for  renal  or  urinary  tract  com-
plications (for example lithium for psychiatric treatment, occupational 
use of lead, or, in the case of bladder cancer, exposure to aniline dyes). 
This  chapter  will  address  an  approach  to  patients  with  and  without 
known history of kidney disease, as well as those who have one of a 
wide variety of systemic illnesses that involve the kidney or the lower 
urinary tract.

To begin with the evaluation of renal disorders, note that it is time-
consuming  and  wasteful  to  do  random  testing  prematurely,  which 
would generate a very long list of potential diagnoses. A better approach 
is to look at the evidence from the history, physical examination, and 
basic laboratory studies to arrive at a logical basis for targeted tests that 
would identify a particular disease process (Table 308-1). The findings 

are  influenced  by  the  regions  of  the  kidney  that  are  involved  and  by 
factors such as family history, toxic exposures, the patient’s birth weight 
and  age,  and  time  course  of  the  findings.  As  a  rule,  kidney  diseases 
that begin primarily with glomerular dysfunction have albuminuria as 
the hallmark, whereas those kidney diseases that begin in the tubular 
structures may present primarily with electrolyte disorders or disorders 
of  dilution  and  concentration  of  the  urine.  In  both  glomerular  and 
tubular disorders, upon progressing to chronic disease, the distinction 
is  more  difficult  because  glomerular  diseases  eventually  affect  the 
tubular interstitium and tubular diseases progress to glomerular dys-
function and scarring.

One example of the progression from a tubular disorder to chronic 
kidney  disease  with  late  glomerular  damage  is  the  lysosomal  storage 
disease  cystinosis,  one  of  the  childhood  Fanconi’s  syndromes.  Within 
the  first  year  of  life,  the  affected  child  may  become  easily  dehydrated 
from salt-wasting; feed and grow poorly; develop polyuria, hypotension, 
and  muscle  weakness;  and  show  the  features  of  proximal  tubular  dys-
function. Electrolyte losses result in hypokalemic renal tubular acidosis 
(RTA), renal glycosuria, phosphaturia causing growth delay from renal 
rickets,  and  acidemia.  The  accumulation  of  lysosomal  cystine  leads  to 
destruction of the proximal tubule and adjacent interstitium, while glo-
merular filtration remains near normal and urine contains little albumin.
Even  with  treatment,  progressive  scarring  of  the  capillaries  within 
the interstitial space eventually, over a decade or more, leads to albu-
minuria  and  progressive  decrease  in  GFR.  Electrolytes  like  K+  and 
=  are  retained  at  this  stage  and  metabolic  acidosis  results  from 
HPO4
-. 
+  rather  than  losses  of  HCO3
failure  of  the  kidney  to  produce  NH4
Hypertension  and  edema  from  salt  and  water  retention  replace  the 
low blood pressure associated with the loss of fluid at the earlier stage 
of  tubular  dysfunction.  Anemia  results  from  loss  of  erythropoietin 
production in chronic kidney disease. The symptoms of weakness and 
fatigue are nonspecific in that they might correlate with anemia, hypo- 
or  hyperkalemia,  hypophosphatemia,  acidosis,  l-carnitine  deficiency 
from  proximal  tubule  reabsorptive  failure  in  Fanconi’s  syndrome,  or 
azotemia. Hepatomegaly on a newborn examination, typical of but not 
specific to cystinosis, might raise suspicion of other inborn errors of 
metabolism such as glycogen storage diseases. However, the finding of 
photosensitivity related to highly refractile cystine crystals deposited in 
the cornea is very specific for cystinosis.

In  the  following  discussion,  the  focus  is  on  symptoms  and  signs 
that constitute the major syndromes seen in the patient with kidney or 
lower urinary tract disease. These syndromes are the foundation for the 
diagnosis of particular diseases.

2280 NEPHRITIC SYNDROMES

Nephritis  literally  means  an  inflammatory  condition  of  the  kidney. 
Nephritic inflammation may occur in association with infection, aller-
gic response to medications, systemic autoimmune disorders, or toxic 
exposures. The kidneys may be one of many organs, or the only organ, 
involved  in  the  inflammatory  disorder.  Inflammation  with  enlarge-
ment of the kidneys is often associated with point tenderness over the 
flank and sometimes exquisite costovertebral angle tenderness, requir-
ing gentle palpation for diagnosis.

The nephritic syndromes may be further subdivided depending on 
the inflamed structures within the kidney, including vascular, glomer-
ular, and tubulointerstitial; and also, on the time course of progression 
of the inflammatory process, which may be acute, subacute, or chronic.

 ■ GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
Glomerulonephritis  (GN)  is  associated  with  hypertension,  volume 
expansion,  and  an  abnormal  urinalysis.  In  most  cases,  the  volume 
expansion manifests as edema and hypertension; in the child, ascites may 
develop; and in the elderly, restlessness and anxiety may be the first signs 
of incipient acute pulmonary edema. There may be orthopnea at night or 
dyspnea on exertion, with or without significant peripheral edema. Acute 
GN is usually associated with low urine output (oliguria or at times com-
plete anuria), low urine sodium content, and concentrated urine, result-
ing in the retention of salt and water. It is an absolute necessity to observe 
the urine, including a spun urinary sediment, to diagnose active GN.

The disease presentation may be acute or subacute (postinfectious 
GN and rapidly progressive GN), occurring over days or weeks; or it 
may  be  chronic,  occurring  over  many  months  to  years.  The  patho-
logic  correlate  of  these  presentations—the  relative  amount  of  acute 
inflammatory, proliferative, or necrotizing lesions in renal tissue ver-
sus  chronic  sclerotic  and  atrophic  findings  on  renal  biopsy—reflects 
the acuity versus chronicity of disease. Therefore, in these progressive 
destructive  conditions,  early  diagnosis  is  critical  and  treatment  for 
acute reversible disease should be instituted as quickly as possible.

The  evaluation  of  the  findings  on  history,  physical  examination, 
and urinalysis in narrowing diagnostic possibilities for a specific etiol-
ogy of the glomerular syndromes is demonstrated in Fig. 308-1. The 
nephritic  urinalysis  shows  hematuria,  proteinuria,  cells  or  clumps  of 
cells, and cellular casts in the spun urinary sediment. The cells in the 
urine are usually a mixture of red blood cells and inflammatory cells, 
including polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes. Microscopic hema-
turia is invisible to the naked eye, as opposed to macroscopic hema-
turia, identifiable as cola or “tea-colored” urine, caused by hemoglobin 
entering  an  acid  urine.  The  red  cells  enter  the  renal  tubules  through 
breaks in the basement membrane of glomeruli. The process of moving 
across the membrane causes erythrocytes to become misshapen or dys-
morphic. It is unusual in these nephritic syndromes to see blood clots 
or gross hematuria, a term used for overtly blood-red urine that char-
acterizes other syndromes or lower urinary tract bleeding. However, in 
episodes of IgA nephropathy, glomerular hematuria is often “gross” as 
RBCs traverse rents in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).

Postinfectious  Glomerulonephritis  Postinfectious  glomerulo-
nephritis  (PIGN)  is  the  classic  example  of  acute  GN,  a  complement- 
mediated immune complex response, to a bacterial antigen occurring 10 
days to 3 weeks after a specific nephritogenic strain of group A streptococ-
cal pharyngitis, or after skin infection such as impetigo. Because the sore 
throat  or  skin  infection  may  have  already  resolved,  antibiotic  treatment 
may not be necessary at this stage of renal complication, but it is impor-
tant for the clinician to inquire about these possible prior events. Subacute 
bacterial endocarditis, if present by history, may also result in a circulating 
immune complex disorder, even while the patient remains on antibiotic 
treatment. These glomerulonephritic and other immune complex condi-
tions are recognized by low-C3 complement levels in the blood. However, 
the postinfectious cases should be distinguished from cases of infection- 
associated  glomerulonephritis  that  occur  during  an  ongoing  infection, 
such as a staphylococcal (often MRSA) abscess or empyema, which are 
treated  with  antibiotics  and  purulent  drainage  and  are  characteristically 
associated with IgA and complement deposition in the glomeruli.

FIGURE  308-1  Rapidly  progressive  glomerulonephritis.  The  syndrome  of  RPGN 
is  diagnosed  clinically.  The  three  major  categories  are  the  antineutrophilic 
cytoplasmic  antibodies  (ANCA-positive  vasculitities);  antiglomerular  basement 
membrane antibody-positive (anti-GBM); and immune complex disorders with low 
C3  complement.  C3  is  synthesized  in  the  liver,  bound  to  circulating  infectious  or 
neoplastic antigens with their antibody complexes, and deposited in the glomerular 
subendothelium  is  associated  with  non-renal  manifestations.  Syphilis  is  usually 
accompanied  by  vasculitis,  and  cryoglobulins  may  be  in  setting  of  hepatitis  C  or 
myeloma and often lowers C4 as well. SBE, subacute bacterial endocarditis; SLE, 
systemic lupus erythematosus.

Postinfectious GN is to be distinguished from synpharyngitic hema-
turia,  another  glomerular  syndrome  that  frequently  produces  gross 
hematuria, a heavier excretion of red blood, which may appear to the 
patient as a frightening hemorrhage. The patient may present with this 
concern  so  it  is  important  for  the  clinician  to  recognize  that  as  little 
as  10–20  mL  of  blood  will  turn  a  liter  of  urine  red.  Synpharyngitic 
hematuria, usually with a viral pharyngitis, is most often related to IgA 
nephropathy rather than postinfectious GN. Another feature that distin-
guishes IgA nephropathy from postinfectious GN is that the former usu-
ally demonstrates normal circulating C3 complement as opposed to low 
complement in PIGN. IgA nephropathy can cause chronic microhema-
turia or bouts of gross hematuria or can occur in association with other 
immunologic conditions including celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, 
reactive  arthritis,  and  ankylosing  spondylitis.  IgA  nephropathy  and 
staphylococcal-associated GN are more common in Asian populations.

RAPIDLY  PROGRESSIVE  GLOMERULONEPHRITIS  (RPGN)  Rapidly 
progressive  glomerulonephritis  (RPGN)  is  a  syndrome  arising  from 
a  variety  of  causes  (Fig.  308-1).  Pathologically  it  is  associated  with  a 
proliferation  of  glomerular  parietal  epithelial  cells  and  inflammatory 
cells called cellular crescents surrounding the capillary that, over time, 
becomes fibrotic and atrophic with global loss of the glomerular tuft.

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary TractWhen >50% of glomeruli are affected (diffuse), this highly destructive 
process  usually  leads  to  glomerular  sclerosis.  Recognition  of  RPGN 
and  choice  of  appropriate  therapy  are  extremely  important  because, 
if left unchecked, the syndrome can lead to complete and irreversible 
loss of kidney function, as well as fatal pulmonary hemorrhage when 
associated with lung vasculitis.

In  the  case  of  RPGN,  one  sees  the  typical  signs  of  the  nephritic 
syndrome,  though  other  clues  to  diagnosis  may  be  present  in  the 
pulmonary-renal  syndromes,  where  the  patient  may  present  with 
hemoptysis, interstitial lung disease, epistaxis, or upper airway symp-
toms  of  sinusitis  or  nasal  congestion.  Blood  testing  helps  narrow 
the  differential  diagnosis.  The  antineutrophil  cytoplasmic  antibody 
(ANCA)  test,  particularly  those  made  up  of  antimyeloperoxidase 
(pANCA)  or  antiproteinase-3  antibodies  (cANCA),  is  diagnostic  for 
the  pauci-immune  disorders  of  systemic  vasculitis.  Granulomatous 
vasculitis (formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis) and micro-
scopic  polyangiitis  are  conditions  particularly  associated  with  pul-
monary and upper respiratory disease. By contrast, a positive test for 
antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies would be 
consistent with either renal-limited anti-GBM disease or, when asso-
ciated  with  pulmonary  hemorrhage,  with  Goodpasture  disease.  The 
latter is more often seen in young males who smoke or have a history 
of inhaling hydrocarbon solvents.

The  immune  complex  diseases  that  manifest  as  RPGN  have  low 
C3 levels secondary to high clearance of circulating complement with 
immune  complex  deposits  in  the  glomerular  subendothelial  space. 
Certain of these disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
and  cryoglobulinemia,  can  present  with  pulmonary  hemorrhage. 
Patients with cryoglobulinemia often have low C4 complement and a 
high rheumatoid factor, and the syndrome may be caused by parapro-
teinemias or hepatitis C. Another cause of crescentic RPGN but with 
normal C3 complement is a form of IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schonlein 
purpura), a syndrome of skin vasculitis characterized by palpable pur-
pura,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  and  arthralgias,  and  in  the  vasculitic 
form,  pulmonary  hemorrhage.  The  C3  complement  (an  acute  phase 
reactant) is detected in the kidney biopsy but not associated with low 
serum levels. The diagnostic tests and distinct diseases associated with 
these immune complex disorders are shown in Fig. 308-1.

Tubulointerstitial  Nephritis  Tubulointerstitial  nephritis  (TIN) 
comprises  inflammatory  disorders  of  the  renal  tubules  and  intersti-
tium, which may be caused by infection, autoimmune disease, allergic 
immunologic responses to certain drugs (Fig. 308-2) and have a time 
course ranging from days to weeks and months.

ACUTE  ALLERGIC  AND  IMMUNE  INTERSTITIAL  NEPHRITIS  Acute 
allergic or immune interstitial nephritis (AIN) usually occurs 1 day to 
2 weeks following exposure to an offending drug and may be associated 
with a rapid and potentially reversible loss of kidney function, which 
may occur in the setting of a change in dose or the restarting of a pre-
viously used medication. Associated glomerular proteinuria sometimes 
occurs with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
or  ampicillin.  Clinically,  there  may  be  fever,  rash,  and  eosinophilia; 
the  last  is  typical  for  certain  penicillins,  fluoroquinolones,  and  some 
biologic  cancer  drugs  that  act  as  checkpoint  inhibitors  (CPIs)  but  is 
atypical  for  NSAIDs.  Patients  who  recover  from  CPI-induced  acute 
kidney injury (AKI) may be restarted on the inhibitor.

The  urinalysis  usually  shows  pyuria  and  at  times  eosinophiluria, 
but the most characteristic cell types are activated T lymphocytes and 
plasma cells, along with some white blood cell casts. A cyto-centrifuged 
specimen containing the sediment within a small tube mounted per-
pendicular to the slide, then stained with Giemsa, best demonstrates 
these cell types.

The patient may experience symptoms of polyuria and tender kid-
neys, and signs of tubular dysfunction including nephrogenic diabetes 
insipidus, hypo- or hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acido-
sis. Common drugs that cause AIN include the proton pump inhibitors 
(PPIs) and sulfa drugs, especially sulfamethoxazole, but also extending 
to  sulfa-containing  diuretics  such  as  acetazolamide,  thiazides,  and

furosemide,  and  less  frequently,  bumetanide.  PPI’s  may  increase  risk 
for  AIN  in  patients  on  check  point  inhibitors.  Frequently,  rifampin 
and  a  few  other  drugs  cause  a  noncaseating  granulomatous  intersti-
tial  nephritis;  in  caseating  granulomas  resulting  from  hematogenous 
spread  of  mycobacterium  tuberculosis,  the  first  granulomas  appear 
connected to the glomeruli in the cortex where oxygen tension is at its 
highest. Granulomatous TIN may occur in sarcoidosis.

Systemic  infections  including  bacterial,  viral,  fungal,  and  parasitic 
may  induce  tubulointerstitial  nephritis,  first  described  pathologically 
in  the  preantibiotic  era  as  Councilman’s  nephritis  in  the  course  of 
scarlet fever.

Autoimmune interstitial nephritis is seen in diseases such as lupus 
nephritis,  ANCA-positive  vasculitis,  and  other  rheumatic  disorders 
including Sjogren’s syndrome, which may present with dry eyes as part 
of the sicca syndrome. In a patient with photophobia and red painful 
eye, the clinician should look at renal function and the urinalysis for 
evidence of tubulointerstitial nephritis uveitis (TINU) syndrome.

Noninflammatory  Interstitial  Diseases  Noninflammatory 
interstitial  diseases  are  often  caused  by  toxic  exposures  that  damage 
the  tubular  interstitial  structures.  For  example,  a  cancer  patient  on 
ifosfamide  may  develop  Fanconi’s  syndrome,  indicating  proximal 
tubule  damage.  Heavy-metal  exposures  such  as  cadmium,  lead,  and 
mercury  from  old  dental  fillings  may  lead  to  proximal  tubule  injury 
and, again, Fanconi’s syndrome. A patient with hypomagnesemia and 
acute  kidney  injury  (AKI)  may  have  had  past  exposure  to  platinum-
containing  chemotherapeutic  agents  and  a  patient  with  nephrogenic 
diabetes  insipidus,  unresponsive  to  antidiuretic  hormone,  may  have

2282 had treatment with lithium, analgesics, or chemotherapy. Hypokalemia 
and interstitial disease are consistent with a past history of exposure to 
aminoglycosides or amphotericin-B. The patient with the former may 
complain  of  hearing  loss  and  the  patient  with  the  latter  may  present 
with hypokalemia and RTA.

Chronic interstitial diseases should be suspected in cases of parapro-
teinemia (light-chain nephropathy or amyloidosis) and in patients who 
ingest herbal remedies containing aristolochic acid, as occurs commonly 
in China and has been determined to be the cause of Balkan nephrop-
athy. Perhaps the most common cause of chronic interstitial nephritis 
is prolonged analgesic use to treat chronic pain (not only NSAIDs but 
acetaminophen or combinations of phenacetin, aspirin, and caffeine) as 
part of the analgesic syndrome. The clinician should ask about a prior 
history of pain and also gastrointestinal symptoms that may precede the 
kidney disease; the analgesic drugs often go unreported by the patient. 
It is important to recognize this syndrome because, if the drugs are not 
discontinued, a later development may be urothelial cancers of the distal 
ureter and urinary bladder. Lithium after prolonged use can also cause 
chronic interstitial nephritis along with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
and slowly progressive kidney failure.

Patients  who  have  hypercalcemia  or  hyperoxaluria  may  develop 
nephrocalcinosis, a form of interstitial nephritis characterized by calci-
fications within the renal parenchyma, often at the cortical medullary 
boundary. When nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis are concurrent, 
the most common etiologies include hypercalcemic disorders, partic-
ularly primary hyperparathyroidism, and congenital medullary sponge 
disease (tubular ectasia), as well as hereditary distal RTA. In patients 
with DM, chronic analgesic use, or sickle-cell diseases, the phenome-
non of papillary necrosis is associated with chronic interstitial damage 
characterized  by  nephrogenic  diabetes  insipidus.  For  example,  phen-
acetin toxicity is a result of the drug’s concentrating in the medulla due 
to  the  normal  urinary  concentrating  mechanism;  ironically,  the  first 
function lost because of medullary toxicity is the ability to concentrate 
the  urine.  In  the  ensuing  papillary  necrosis,  the  patient  may  observe 
solids  in  the  urine,  which  are  sloughed  tissue  from  the  ischemic 
medulla. When a patient with inflammatory bowel disease or one who 
has  had  gastric  bypass  procedures  such  as  the  Roux-en-Y  develops 
kidney injury, with or without calcium oxalate kidney stones, a 24-h 
urine oxalate measurement must be determined to diagnose intestinal 
hyperoxaluria, which otherwise may lead to nephrocalcinosis. Chronic 
bacterial pyelonephritis is not a common cause of chronic renal failure 
because it rarely affects both kidneys. Acute pyelonephritis in a solitary 
kidney or transplanted kidney may cause AKI.

 ■ PROTEINURIC STATES AND NEPHROTIC 
SYNDROME
Proteinuric  States  Some  patients  notice  generalized  edema  and 
foamy  urine,  manifestations  of  proteinuria.  Proteinuria  is  not  syn-
onymous  with  nephrotic  syndrome  (NS).  In  DM  the  urinary  loss  of 
microalbuminuria  (MALB)  defines  glomerular  proteinuria,  which 
typically  occurs  after  years  of  small-vessel  disease  (explaining  the 
likelihood of coincident small-vessel retinopathy) and predicts future 
development  of  progressive  renal  failure  and  NS.  The  rate  of  renal 
progression  is  greater  with  hypertension,  obesity,  and  poor  glucose 
control.  Further  risks  are  nephrectomy,  hepatitis  C,  and,  as  in  focal 
segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), in patients of African ancestry 
is likely due to the prevalence of the APOL1 gene mutations. Because 
treatment  of  patients  with  MALB  is  indicated,  the  clinician  caring 
for diabetic patients should screen regularly for the presence of small 
amounts of albumin in the urine, which can be detected as microalbu-
minuria (30–300 mg/day of albumin excretion) by radioimmunoassay. 
Subnephrotic  albuminuria  is  characteristic  of  focal  diseases  of  the 
kidney with <50% of glomeruli involved, whereas NS is likely diffuse, 
involving most glomeruli. Lower levels of albuminuria are characteris-
tic of glomerulonephritis, as discussed above.

Microalbuminuria  is  beneath  detection  by  urinary  dipstick  pro-
tein  analysis.  Any  detectable  albuminuria  on  dipstick  is  called  overt 
proteinuria  and  when  detected  at  the  highest  level  on  the  strip  is 

consistent with nephrotic proteinuria. The dipstick measurement picks 
up only the most acidic proteins like albumin but not proteins with a 
higher isoelectric point, most notably kappa and lambda light chains 
found in multiple myeloma. Additionally, the filtration of light chains 
may  cause  glomerular  damage  and  albuminuria  (kappa  light-chain 
nephropathy or lambda AL amyloid) but does not require an abnormal 
glomerulus because their charge and molecular weight allow them to 
freely cross the glomerular barrier. Such filtration is considered over-
flow proteinuria.

A  laboratory  measurement  of  albumin  or  total  protein  should  be 
normalized to urine creatinine concentration as a ratio in order to dis-
count the effects of urinary dilution or concentration. It is also impor-
tant to note that the ratio of total protein concentration to creatinine 
concentration is not specific for albumin excretion and may indicate 
the  presence  of  light  chains.  The  detection  of  light  chains  requires  a 
urine protein electrophoresis.

Another type of proteinuria known as tubular proteinuria, which is 
mostly β-2 microglobulin, is secreted by proximal tubular cells and is 
common in interstitial nephritis.

Nephrotic Syndrome  Nephrotic syndrome (NS) has three defin-
ing  features:  edema,  hypoalbuminemia  (<3.5  g/dL),  and  proteinuria 
>3.5 g/day. The syndrome is often associated with lipid abnormalities 
such as a high LDL, low HDL, and lipiduria. The urine may contain 
large tubular epithelial cells that are engulfed with the lipid in a recog-
nizable  shape  under  polarized  light.  These  oval  fat  bodies  may  also 
contain  cholesterol  monohydrate  crystals,  which  appear  as  Maltese 
crosses. Under low light, the refractile lipid may be seen as fatty casts.
Clinically, patients present with generalized edema and, in contrast 
to heart failure with orthopnea, facial, eyelid and periorbital swelling 
is observed in NS. Penile and scrotal edema can be severe enough to 
obstruct urethral urine flow in men. In some cases, edema may form 
large bullae that may rupture, predisposing to ulceration and cellulitis. 
The  skin  becomes  smooth  and  may  appear  to  “weep.”  Patients  may 
have hoarseness caused by vocal cord edema. On occasion, nephrotic 
range proteinuria is not associated with edema, for example in the case 
of human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), 
which is more common in blacks with HIV. In these cases, rapid loss of 
renal function may occur due to implosion of the glomerular capillary 
by  proliferation  of  visceral  epithelial  cells  that  crush  the  glomerular 
loops,  decreasing  capillary  flow  and  filtering  surface  area  (collapsing 
glomerulopathy). This glomerulopathy is a severe, treatment-resistant 
form of FSGS. Other secondary forms of FSGS, more often not asso-
ciated with NS, include remnant kidney after partial surgical removal, 
adaptive  injury,  chronic  hypoxemia,  sickle  cell  diseases,  recurrent 
vasculitis  with  healing  of  some  glomeruli,  obesity,  and  congenital 
urogenital  anomalies.  Very  heavy  proteinuria  is  often  noted  in  this 
syndrome. Secondary forms of FSGS are shown in Fig. 308-3. Other 
secondary forms of FSGS, more often not associated with NS, include 
remnant kidney after partial surgical removal, adaptive injury, chronic 
hypoxemia  from  chronic  lung  or  congenital  heart  disease,  sickle  cell 
diseases, recurrent vasculitis with healing of some glomeruli, obesity, 
and congenital urogenital anomalies.

NS  is  a  hypercatabolic  state  with  negative  nitrogen  balance  due 
to  proximal  tubule  absorption  and  lysosomal  catabolism  exceeding 
hepatic  albumin  synthesis.  A  characteristic  finding  of  rapid-onset 
hypoalbuminemia in NS is horizontal linear white lines in the nail bed, 
known as Muehrcke’s lines. When NS in the adult occurs abruptly, with 
severe elevation of cholesterol, one must consider glomerular epithelial 
injury  (podocytopathy),  which  may  be  idiopathic  minimal  change 
disease (MCD), a name historically based on the appearance of renal 
tissue on light microscopy and often preceded by an upper respiratory 
infection,  allergies,  or  immunization.  Secondary  causes  of  MCD  are 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma or other lymphoproliferative disorders. MCD can 
occur at any age and in the adult may present with AKI as well, primar-
ily because of the underlying vascular disease and hypoalbuminemia.

Age is important in the onset of NS, in that young children <6 years 
of age frequently have MCD. Several gene mutations encoding for pro-
teins of the podocyte, such as nephrin (NPHS1) and podocin (NPHS2)

FIGURE  308-3  Nephrotic  syndrome.  Different  pathologic  syndromes  broken  down  into  the  idiopathic 
and secondary causes. 70% of primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is associated with antibodies to 
the  integral  subepithelial  basement  membrane  antigen  phospholipase  A2  receptor  (PLA2R).  The  former 
term  for  primary  membrano-proliferative  GN  has  been  replaced  by  pathologic  syndromes  involving 
complement  deposition  (C3  glomerulopathy  and  dense-deposit  disease  in  children).  AL  amyloid  is  the 
form of amyloidosis secondary to lambda light-chain deposition and SAA is the protein (serum amyloid 
A) associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, familial Mediterranean 
fever, and tuberculosis.

in the slit diaphragm, have been shown to be responsible for most cases 
of hereditary nephrotic syndrome (see Table 308-2).

In  children  who  have  a  serum  albumin  concentration  <2  g/dL, 
tissue  ischemia  may  develop,  causing  a  “nephrotic  crisis,”  in  which 
severe  abdominal  pain  may  be  mistaken  for  a  surgical  abdomen.  A 
20-year-old presenting with NS may have MCD, FSGS, or membranous 
nephropathy (MN).

Like MCD, MN exists as primary or secondary etiology. Whereas NS 
is a cause of a hypercoagulable state, particularly when it is accompa-
nied by severe hypoalbuminemia (<2 g/dL), MN is the NS most often 
associated with renal vein thrombosis (RVT) for a number of reasons, 
among them the urinary loss of antithrombin-3 and plasminogen, as 

well  as  hyperfibrinogenemia.  RVT  may  present 
with back pain or pulmonary emboli.

NS with heavy proteinuria or large kidneys on 
ultrasound in advanced stages of chronic kidney 
disease  (CKD)  is  often  noted  in  diabetic  neph-
ropathy,  amyloid,  HIVAN,  and  MN  with  RVT. 
MN  may  be  the  presenting  finding  in  cases  of 
SLE,  whereas  diffuse  proliferative  GN  with  low 
C3, when associated with SLE, occurs in patients 
who also have signs and symptoms of joint, skin, 
or systemic organ involvement. A cause of very 
early MN is an idiosyncratic reaction to NSAIDs, 
even when taken in small amounts. Many other 
drugs  including  penicillamine,  mercury,  and 
gold  can  cause  MN.  Proteinuia  from  any  cause 
may  present  earlier,  or  increase,  when  DM, 
obesity,  partial  nephrectomy,  or  increased  renal 
venous pressure exists.

Solid tumors, particularly lung, gastric, intes-
tinal, bladder, breast, and prostate, may underlie 
a  paraneoplastic  syndrome  of  MN.  While  it  is 
important  to  take  a  history  and  examine  the 
patient carefully for signs of cancer, it is not the 
rule to work up every patient with MN exhaus-
tively for cancer. But the neoplastic nephropathy 
may  be  a  sign  of  recurrent  disease  and  may 
even be recognized by tumor antigens. MN also 
occurs in the context of many infectious diseases, 
including syphilis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and 
hepatitis  B.  Recently,  70%  of  patients  with  pri-
mary  MN  have  been  found  to  have  circulating 
levels  of  an  autoantibody  to  the  phospholipase 
A2  receptor  (anti-PLA2R)  in  the  subepithelial 
region of the glomerular basement membrane.

Patients who have a nephrotic and nephritic 
sediment  in  childhood  may  have  membrano-
proliferative glomerular nephritis (MPGN) with 
low C3 as a primary disease (C3 glomerulopathy 
or  dense-deposit  disease).  The  adult  presenting 
with a nephrotic and nephritic picture should be 
considered to have an immune complex disorder 
unless  proven  otherwise.  In  amyloidosis  there 
may  be  a  simultaneous  and  severe  tubular  syn-
drome in addition to the albuminuria, consisting 
of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and a hyperka-
lemic RTA. When NS is associated with Fanconi’s 
syndrome (glycosuria, phosphaturia, uricosuria, 
and aminoaciduria), one must consider multiple 
myeloma in the adult.

HEMATURIA AND LOWER 
URINARY TRACT SYNDROMES
Because blood could enter the urinary tract from 
any structure, identifying the source is a necessary 
first  step.  As  a  rule,  hematuria  associated  with 
flank pain or ureteral colic is more characteristic 
of a lower urinary tract source, such as a stone or 
an obstructing lesion. However, when flank pain without colic is noted, 
one  has  to  consider  swelling  of  the  kidney  and  stretching  of  the  renal 
capsule, as might be seen in acute urinary obstruction, kidney infection, 
interstitial nephritis, and, on occasion, acute glomerular nephritis. Heavy 
bleeding  with  clots  is  more  characteristic  of  lower  tract  bleeding  but 
could result from trauma to the kidney. In patients who have acute flank 
pain and hypertension, assuming the pain is due to a kidney stone may 
miss an occlusive vascular event from an embolus or in situ clot within 
the arterial blood supply. Patients who engage in strenuous exercise may 
develop  hematuria  that  can  be  ruled  out  by  retesting  the  urine  after  a 
week or two of rest. True hematuria can be distinguished from hemoglo-
binuria and myoglobinuria by urinalysis.

Symptoms  of  lower  urinary  tract  disorders  are  dysuria,  urinary 
frequency,  urgency,  incomplete  emptying,  hematuria  that  is  most 
pronounced at the beginning of the stream, as well as a poor urinary 
stream. Among these disorders are urinary tract infection and prostatic 
hypertrophy. Hematuria of recent onset noted in the fourth decade of 
life  or  beyond  should  undergo  a  urologic  evaluation  and  most  likely 
cystoscopic  examination  of  the  bladder.  However,  chronic  hematuric 
conditions may be associated with chronic glomerular disease such as 
thin  basement  membrane,  hereditary  nephritis,  or  IgA  nephropathy. 
That is why it is so important to search for previous examinations such 
as insurance, military, or employment exams done in the past to deter-
mine if hematuria was present in order to establish chronicity.

ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by the retention of nitrogenous 
solutes  such  as  urea,  uric  acid,  and  creatinine.  The  creatinine  con-
centration goes up primarily related to the amount of water absorbed 
along  the  nephron.  Because  the  urea  but  not  creatinine  has  a  reab-
sorptive  component,  the  clearance  of  urea  is  less  than  the  clearance 
of creatinine. With a constant catabolic rate, a decrease in glomerular 
filtration alone will affect the BUN and creatinine proportionately. In 
contrast,  a  disorder  associated  with  enhanced  urinary  concentration 
(high ADH), in which urea as well as water has increased reabsorption 
in the process of concentrating the urine, the retention of urea nitrogen 
exceeds  that  of  creatinine,  accounting  for  an  elevated  BUN-to-crea-
tinine  ratio.  Oliguric  or  oligoanuric  states  are  often  characterized  as 
prerenal,  meaning  preglomerular  vascular  disease  or  low  perfusion 
states; renal, indicating intrinsic renal disease; or postrenal, indicating 
obstructive nephropathy or uropathy (see Table 308-1).

Prerenal states are often related to a decreased perfusion pressure 
to the glomerular capillaries or some other interference with filtration. 
The  differential  diagnosis  includes  proliferative  GN  (the  bloodless 
capillary);  a  preglomerular  vascular  disease  such  as  scleroderma  or 
thrombotic microangiopathy; the use of pressors for the maintenance 
of  blood  pressure;  vasoconstrictive  substances  including  cocaine, 
iodinated  IV  contrast  media,  hemoglobin  or  myoglobin,  and  certain 
antibiotics like vancomycin, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus (calcineurin 
inhibitors); other vasoconstrictive drugs like nonsteroidals; and renal 
nerve stimulation. Hypercalcemia and hypoxia are also vasoconstric-
tive. Correcting hypoxemia has a diuretic effect.

Intrinsic Renal Disease  All of these will decrease perfusion pres-
sure and decrease GFR while stimulating sodium and water reabsorption. 
Therefore,  the  characteristic  urinary  findings  are  low  urinary  sodium 
excretion and concentrated urine. The urine sodium concentration is usu-
ally low and the urine to plasma creatinine concentration is usually >40. 
The same result could occur in bilateral renal artery stenosis, heart failure, 
and other circulatory collapse. If damage is done to the renal tubules, so-
called intrinsic renal disease, there may or may not be oliguria and in 
fact there could be polyuria (unresponsiveness to ADH), sodium-wasting, 
potassium-wasting, and acid-base disorders, each of which may predom-
inate. One of the most frequent causes of oliguric acute renal failure is 

acute tubular necrosis (ATN), caused by gram-negative sepsis, hemody-
namic  collapse,  hemoglobinuria  or  myoglobinuria,  and  medication  or 
toxin ingestion. Examples are crush injury, heroin and alcohol stupor, and 
compartment syndrome. Drug causes include NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, 
and chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatinum and methotrexate.
Postrenal  States  Postrenal  states  accompanied  by  anuria  suggest 
complete  obstruction  to  the  flow  of  urine,  while  polyuria  and  bland 
urinary  sediment  suggest  incomplete  obstruction  combined  with 
ADH unresponsiveness. The fractional excretion of sodium is usually 
>1–2%,  whereas  in  oliguric  prerenal  syndromes  the  fractional  excre-
tion of sodium is usually <1%. Exception to the low sodium excretion 
would  be  in  the  case  of  hyperchloremic  metabolic  alkalosis,  where 
chloride is being conserved and sodium excreted with bicarbonate.

Urinary tract obstruction is usually characterized by hydronephrosis 
visualized  on  ultrasound  images  or  large  volumes  of  urine  removed 
by  bladder  catheterization,  indicating  bladder  outlet  obstruction. 
Exceptions to finding hydronephrosis on an imaging study include the 
extrinsic obstructive compression of the kidney or ureter in retroperi-
toneal disease; cases in which imaging was done too soon, for example 
<4  days  after  obstruction;  or  when  the  patient  was  simultaneously 
obstructed and volume depleted.

As mentioned earlier, acute tubular diseases that are not primarily 
due to inflammation can be caused by intratubular obstruction, from 
hyperoxaluric states, or by uric acid or phosphates in tumor lysis syn-
drome  following  chemotherapy  for  lymphoproliferative  disorders. 
Other drug therapies that cause tubular injury include cisplatinum, 
ifosfamide, methotrexate, aminoglycosides, and amphotericin B, and 
toxicity through exposure to heavy metals.

Kidney injury in the setting of systemic disease with dysfunction 
in  other  organs  includes  the  cardiorenal,  pulmonary  renal,  and 
hepatorenal syndromes. Other syndromes that typically involve the 
kidney  include  febrile  illness,  systemic  infection  with  septic  shock, 
hemodynamic collapse due to cytokines, or capillary leak syndrome. 
These  syndromes  as  well  as  the  endothelial  origins  of  thrombotic 
microangiopathies  and  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  are  shown  in 
Fig. 308-4. Obstetric patients with abruptio placenta may develop bilat-
eral cortical necrosis and as a consequence, anuria, and often irrevers-
ible  renal  failure.  In  addition,  patients  with  atheroembolic  syndrome 
can present with AKI or chronic progressive damage following an aor-
tic catheterization. If the blood vessels catheterized involve the aortic 
arch, an encephalopathic syndrome that can mimic uremic encephal-
opathy may follow. As many as 70% of patients with COVID-19 who 
required ventilators during the early phase of the pandemic developed 
multiorgan failure, including AKI. AKI may also be a risk for chronic 
kidney disease following a COVID-19 infection.

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND THE 
UREMIC SYNDROME
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), progressing over months to years, can 
be  the  long-term  result  of  any  of  the  previously  mentioned  diseases.

a more recent kidney disorder are useful, for example, the finding of 
bilaterally small kidneys on a renal ultrasound. Kidneys by this method 
are normally 10–12 cm in length. Small kidneys, <8 cm, are likely atro-
phic with irreversibly low function; but in some cases of CKD, such as 
diabetes, the kidneys may be large despite kidney failure. Remarkably, 
even atrophic kidneys may still produce renin to sustain blood pressure 
and erythropoietin to minimize anemia; however, due to low calcitriol 
in CKD, patients develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. The normal 
parathyroid gland weighing 25 mg would be limited in raising PTH, 
such that very elevated PTH likely is in favor of CKD. Thinning of the 
renal cortex is also a sign of chronicity.

DM accounts for approximately 50% of CKD patients that progress 
to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Other important causes leading to 
ESRD are IgA nephropathy, ischemic nephropathy without proteinuria 
manifesting  after  age  50  years  with  hypertension,  and  signs  of  other 

large-vessel disease, such as intermittent claudication from peripheral 
vascular disease, stroke, and coronary artery disease. In contrast, renal 
arterial disease due to fibromuscular dysplasia, seen predominantly in 
white women in the fourth decade of life, does not progress to renal 
failure and is a treatable form of hypertension. Other arterial diseases 
include  polyarteritis  nodosum  (PAN)  and,  in  medium-sized  vessels, 
a  Kawasaki-like  illness  affecting  children,  which  has  had  a  thirtyfold 
increase  since  the  onset  of  COVID-19  as  part  of  the  multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome.

Hereditary  and  congenital  diseases  of  the  kidney  are  shown  in 
Table  308-2.  Autosomal  dominant  PCKD  occurs  in  all  ethnic  popu-
lations. The patient may first show signs of cysts in late teenage years 
with hypertension, urinary or cyst infection, or pain and bleeding. Kidney 
stones may be seen. By the age of 30 years, individuals with the disorder 
will have ultrasound-detectable cysts. The clinician should know that

a diagnosis of PCKD requires multiple cysts in both kidneys. Cysts are 
also found in the liver. The first manifestation of PCKD may be a cere-
bral hemorrhage, since berry aneurysms are present in a small subset 
of patients with this disease, most commonly in the circle of Willis.

Hereditary  nephritis  with  many  variations  includes  the  Alport 
syndrome,  involving  a  gene  mutation  (COL4A5,  accounting  for  the 
majority of cases) effecting the alpha 3 region of the noncollagenous 
domain of type IV collagen in GBM. There is an X-linked pattern of 
genetic  transmission,  where  males  may  be  most  severely  affected  by 
renal failure in middle age. The syndrome involves hematuria, neuro-
sensory hearing loss, and ocular deformities of the lens. A predominant 
symptom  in  hereditary  nephritis  is  microscopic  hematuria  and  the 
pathologic  correlate  to  this  is  thin  basement  membranes.  It  must  be 
distinguished from the less severe and more common related condition 
known as thin basement membrane disease as a cause of hematuria.

Certain  congenital  abnormalities  of  the  kidney,  such  as  horseshoe 
and ectopic kidneys, also shown in Table 308-2, consist of low nephron 
numbers that may result in secondary FSGS. The condition known as 
ureteral reflux is an abnormality involving the functional insertion of 
the  ureter  into  the  muscular  bladder,  which  normally  closes  off  the 
ureter  upon  bladder  contraction.  In  reflux  disease  the  ureter  cannot 
prevent  retrograde  flux  of  urine  during  micturition.  In  children  this 
may cause hypertension and, in some cases, secondary FSGS. Surgical 
correction of the abnormality may be curative, but the child may out-
grow it in adulthood in any case.

The stages of CKD are listed in Table 308-3 and are important in 
terms of planning for renal replacement therapy (dialysis and trans-
plantation),  and  for  assessing  and  slowing  the  rate  of  progression, 
defined as the decline in GFR over time. In CKD, the estimated GFR 
(eGFR) is determined by the current stable serum creatinine, entered 
into  one  of  several  equations  derived  from  clinical  trial  data  that 
compared  the  subject’s  value  to  actual  measurements  of  GFR.  For 
example, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study 
used a radioisotope (I125iothalamate) clearance to measure true GFR. 
The equation contains additional factors such as age and sex to derive 
the current eGFR, corrected for 1.73 m2 body-surface area. This value 
of eGFR is not a creatinine clearance, nor a measurement of GFR.

There has been debate about the inclusion of corrective factors that 
would alter the result from that equation, based on the patient’s ethnic-
ity and race. For example, it has been recommended in some centers to 
multiply the eGFR value by a factor of 1.2 in black patients in order to 
correct for the perceived underestimate of GFR using the MDRD equa-
tion. There is considerable objection to making this correction, which 
may have the effect of introducing bias based on race. Because the cor-
rected eGFR will give a higher value to the GFR, there could be delays 
in  discussion  of  renal  replacement  therapy  and  in  initiation  of  treat-
ment. Consequently, the correction has fallen out of favor. Recently an 
alternative,  the  Chronic  Kidney  Disease  Epidemiology  Collaboration 
(CKD-EPI), has been used that excludes race as a parameter. Another 
method of calculating GFR uses cystatin-C.

In  the  course  of  CKD,  the  clinician  must  evaluate  the  patient  for 
symptoms and signs of worsening renal function. When the eGFR is 
<15–20  mL/min,  the  patient  should  already  have  had  conversations 

about choices of eventual treatment and, if indicated, surgical prepa-
ration for peritoneal or hemodialysis. Attention should be given to the 
sensitive topic of transition to a lifesaving but mechanical procedure. It 
is also important to discuss transplantation and issues of timing. The 
ethical standard is for separate clinicians to evaluate the recipient and 
donor  of  a  kidney  transplant.  Confidentiality  and  privacy  are  essen-
tial. Very importantly, access to transplantation has not been equally 
offered to minority populations and it is incumbent on the clinician to 
avoid bias by discussing the option with every patient.

Symptoms  of  CKD  are  often  nonspecific  and  include  fatigue, 
weakness,  loss  of  appetite  and  taste,  weight  loss,  mood  changes,  and 
metabolic encephalopathy that may involve cognitive changes such as 
decline in executive function and the ability to calculate and remem-
ber. Other symptoms are peripheral and autonomic neuropathies and 
sleep  and  movement  disorders  such  as  restless  legs  and  asterixis  or 
myoclonus.  Patients  with  AKD  lose  their  ability  to  concentrate  the 
urine,  and  therefore  have  an  obligate  urine  output  of  approximately 
2 L. This results in nocturia, since the bladder fills during the night. 
Ironically,  the  loss  of  nocturia  may  be  sensed  by  the  patient  as  an 
improvement  of  symptoms  but  actually  indicates  worsening  oliguria. 
Pruritis commonly occurs. Clinical issues include changes in medica-
tions and doses. The full uremic syndrome is characterized by severe 
hypertension,  the  above-mentioned  encephalopathic  manifestations, 
GI  bleeding,  pericarditis,  severe  electrolyte  disturbances,  particu-
larly  hyperkalemia,  and  secondary  hyperparathyroidism.  Anemia  is 
frequently  present  and  though  it  may  be  due  to  iron  deficiency  or 
decreased  erythropoietin,  other  causes  of  anemia  should  be  investi-
gated. Patients respond well to erythropoietic stimulating agents, with 
the goal of therapy >10 g/dL but <12 g/dL. Notably, not all patients are 
anemic.  For  example,  some  patients  with  urinary  tract  obstruction, 
polycystic kidney disease, renal vascular disease, and renal cell carci-
noma may in fact have erythrocytosis.

In  nephrotic  syndrome,  heavy  proteinuria  may  persist  throughout 
the  course  of  CKD  and  carries  a  worse  prognosis.  In  all  kidney  dis-
eases, including the nephritic processes, renal disease may progress to 
late stages even when the acute inflammation has subsided. However, 
the underlying mechanisms of progressive renal failure involve inflam-
matory pathways (reflected in elevated levels of C-reactive protein and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate in CKD), emphasizing the importance 
of  managing  risk  factors  for  cardiovascular  disease,  such  as  hyper-
tension,  smoking,  hyperlipidemias,  diabetes,  and  obesity  early  in  the 
course of CKD.

Some  chronic  renal  syndromes  may  present  with  predominant 
tubular dysfunction, including genetic diseases known as channelop-
athies. Examples are the depletion of electrolytes such as phosphorus 
and  potassium  and  proximal  RTA  due  to  Fanconi’s  syndrome,  men-
tioned above; hypokalemic alkalosis and volume depletion in Bartter’s 
syndrome (mutations resulting in abnormal loop of Henle function); 
and  electrolyte  losses  in  Gitelman’s,  a  defect  in  the  thiazide-sensitive 
sodium-chloride  transporter.  Gitelman’s  also  causes  hypochloremic 
hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Bartter’s and Gitelman’s can be dis-
tinguished  by  examining  the  urine  for  the  usual  solutes  regulated  by 
these  transporters.  Thus,  Bartter’s  is  associated  with  hypercalciuria 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2286

20/01/22   8:48 PM

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractand the inability to put out a concentrated urine, whereas Gitelman’s is 
associated with hypocalciuria and preserved ability to concentrate the 
urine. Fanconi’s syndrome results in hypokalemic acidosis and can be 
distinguished from distal RTA, which does not associate with the loss 
of glucose, amino acids, and phosphate in the urine.

Disorders  involving  the  collecting  duct  and  its  transporters  of 
sodium,  potassium,  and  acid  base  can  result  in  syndromes  that  also 
suggest  certain  diagnoses.  For  example,  polyuria  due  to  inappro-
priate  free  water  losses  and  insensitive  to  ADH  is  characteristic  of 
nephrogenic  diabetes  insipidus  and  it  is  common  to  see  simultane-
ous  defects  in  potassium  secretion  and  hydrogen  ion  secretion,  with 
hypertension suggesting blockade of one of the sodium regulators of 
ENaC.  These  disorders  are  usually  associated  with  hyporenin  and/
or  hypoaldosterone  states,  which  include  UTO,  type  4  RTAs  in  DM, 
amyloidosis, or Addison’s disease. In contrast, hypokalemic metabolic 
alkalosis  with  volume  expansion  may  suggest  an  adrenal  adenoma, 
unilateral renal artery stenosis, ACTH-secreting tumors, licorice abuse, 
or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Renal  Masses  Patients  with  renal  cell  carcinoma  may  have  been 
diagnosed via an incidental finding in an abdominal imaging study, or 
sometimes by a palpable mass best felt with the patient supine, usually 
a thin patient but occasionally a very large protruding mass. Very large 
masses or multiple masses that are easily palpable may represent cys-
tic diseases of the kidney, including polycystic kidney disease (PKD) 
or  even  a  single  cyst,  versus  a  congenital  ureteral  pelvic  obstruction. 
Other  times,  a  renal  cell  carcinoma  can  present  as  anemia,  possibly 
caused by hematuria, or as back pain associated with metastatic lytic 
vertebral lesions. Metastases may involve the lungs and the bone mar-
row as well.

Imaging  and  Renal  Biopsy  Indications  For  hematuric  syn-
dromes,  imaging  may  add  valuable  information,  particularly  in  the 
patient  who  has  heavy  bleeding  or  blood  clots  in  the  urine.  Renal 
pathology  may  be  detected  as  an  abdominal  mass,  as  in  the  case  of 
renal cell carcinoma, chronic urinary tract obstruction, or cystic dis-
eases  of  the  kidney  including  polycystic  kidney  disease  (PKD)  and 
simple cyst. If the patient has a known history of tubular sclerosis or the 
finding of skin fibroadenoma, one might identify a renal mass found 
on CT imaging as an angiomyolipoma.

The  renal  ultrasound  is  efficacious  in  determining  the  size  and 
symmetry  of  the  kidneys  and  in  excluding  urinary  obstruction.  It  is 
helpful in detecting renal cysts or mass, but less useful in kidney stone 
disease.  Ultrasound  is  not  as  accurate  a  tool  for  angiomyolipomas. 
The renal-limited noncontrast CT scan is the standard test for neph-
rolithiasis but carries the risk of accumulative radiation. MRI is often 
useful  in  evaluating  and  following  renal  masses,  including  renal  cell 
carcinoma.  The  patient  with  renal  disease  may  develop  the  compli-
cation  of  systemic  sclerosis  after  receiving  gadolinium;  new  contrast 
media to replace it are emerging. CT iodinated contrast media remain a 
problem, particularly in the patient with vascular disease of the kidney. 
Radioisotope  scanning  is  useful  in  demonstrating  the  percentage  of 
renal function coming from each kidney. Finally, in many of the dis-
eases  discussed  above,  diagnosis  ultimately  depends  on  renal  biopsy 
and pathologic evaluation.

Cell Biology and  
Physiology of the Kidney
Alfred L. George, Jr., Eric G. Neilson

The kidney is one of the most highly differentiated organs in the body. 
At the conclusion of embryologic development, nearly 30 different cell 
types form a multitude of filtering capillaries and segmented nephrons 
enveloped by a dynamic interstitium. This cellular diversity modulates 
a  variety  of  complex  physiologic  processes.  Endocrine  functions,  the 
regulation  of  blood  pressure  and  intraglomerular  hemodynamics, 
solute  and  water  transport,  acid-base  balance,  and  removal  of  drug 
metabolites  are  all  accomplished  by  intricate  mechanisms  of  renal 
response. This breadth of physiology hinges on the clever ingenuity of 
nephron architecture that evolved as complex organisms came out of 
water to live on land.

EMBRYOLOGIC DEVELOPMENT
Kidneys  develop  from  intermediate  mesoderm  under  the  timed 
or  sequential  control  of  a  growing  number  of  genes,  described  in  
Fig.  309-1.  The  transcription  of  these  genes  is  guided  by  morpho-
genic  cues  that  invite  two  ureteric  buds  to  each  penetrate  bilateral 
metanephric blastema, where they induce primary mesenchymal cells 
to form early nephrons. The two ureteric buds emerge from posterior 
nephric ducts and mature into separate collecting systems that even-
tually  form  a  renal  pelvis  and  ureter.  Induced  mesenchyme  under-
goes  mesenchymal  epithelial  transitions  to  form  comma-shaped 
bodies  at  the  proximal  end  of  each  ureteric  bud  leading  to  the 
formation of S-shaped nephrons that cleft and enjoin with penetrat-
ing endothelial cells derived from sprouting angioblasts. Under the 
influence  of  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  A  (VEGF-A),  these 
penetrating  cells  form  capillaries  with  surrounding  mesangial  cells 
that differentiate into a glomerular filter for plasma water and solute. 
The  ureteric  buds  branch,  and  each  branch  produces  a  new  set  of 
nephrons.  The  number  of  branching  events  ultimately  determines 
the  total  number  of  nephrons  in  each  kidney.  There  are  ~900,000 
glomeruli in each kidney in normal-birth-weight adults and as few as 
225,000 in low-birth-weight adults, with the latter producing numer-
ous comorbid risks.

Glomeruli evolve as complex capillary filters with fenestrated endo-
thelia  under  the  guiding  influence  of  VEGF-A  and  angiopoietin-1 
secreted  by  adjacently  developing  podocytes.  Epithelial  podocytes 
facing the urinary space envelop the exterior basement membrane sup-
porting  these  emerging  endothelial  capillaries.  Podocytes  are  partially 
polarized  and  periodically  slough  into  the  urinary  space  by  epithelial- 
mesenchymal  transition  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  apoptosis,  only  to  be 
replenished  by  migrating  parietal  epithelia  from  Bowman  capsule. 
Impaired replenishment results in heavy proteinuria. Podocytes attach 
to the basement membrane by special foot processes and share a slit-
pore  membrane  with  their  neighbor.  The  slit-pore  membrane  forms 
a  filter  for  plasma  water  and  solute  by  the  synthetic  interaction  of 
nephrin, annexin-4, CD2AP, FAT, ZO-1, P-cadherin, podocin, TRPC6, 
PLCE1, and Neph 1-3 proteins. Mutations in many of these proteins 
also result in heavy proteinuria. The glomerular capillaries are embed-
ded in a mesangial matrix shrouded by parietal and proximal tubular 
epithelia forming Bowman capsule. Mesangial cells have an embryonic 
lineage consistent with arteriolar or juxtaglomerular cells and contain 
contractile  actin-myosin  fibers.  These  mesangial  cells  make  contact 
with glomerular capillary loops, and their local matrix holds them in 
condensed arrangement.

Between  nephrons  lies  the  renal  interstitium.  This  region  forms  a 
functional space surrounding glomeruli and their downstream tubules, 
which  are  home  to  resident  and  trafficking  cells  such  as  fibroblasts, 
dendritic cells, occasional lymphocytes, and lipid-laden macrophages. 
The  cortical  and  medullary  peritubular  capillaries,  which  siphon  off

tissue  that  supports  the  kidney’s  emblematic  architecture  of  folding 
tubules.  The  relational  precision  of  these  structures  determines  the 
unique physiology of the kidney.

Each  nephron  is  partitioned  during  embryologic  development 
into a proximal tubule, descending and ascending limbs of the loop 
of Henle, distal tubule, and the collecting duct. These classic tubular 
segments  build  from  subsegments  lined  by  highly  unique  epithelia 
serving  regional  physiology.  All  nephrons  have  the  same  structural 
components,  but  there  are  two  types  whose  structures  depend  on 
their  location  within  the  kidney.  The  majority  of  nephrons  are 
cortical,  with  glomeruli  located  in  the  mid-to-outer  cortex.  Fewer 
nephrons are juxtamedullary, with glomeruli at the boundary of the 
cortex  and  outer  medulla.  Cortical  nephrons  have  short  loops  of 
Henle,  whereas  juxtamedullary  nephrons  have  long  loops  of  Henle. 
There are critical differences in blood supply as well. The peritubular 
capillaries surrounding cortical nephrons are shared among adjacent 
nephrons. By contrast, juxtamedullary nephrons depend on individ-
ual capillaries called vasa recta that run alongside the long loops of 
Henle. Cortical nephrons perform most of the glomerular filtration 
because there are more of them and because their afferent arterioles 
are larger than their respective efferent arterioles. The juxtamedullary 
nephrons, with longer loops of Henle, create an osmotic gradient for 
concentrating  urine.  How  developmental  instructions  specify  the 
differentiation  of  all  these  unique  epithelia  among  various  tubular 
segments is still unknown.

DETERMINANTS AND REGULATION OF 
GLOMERULAR FILTRATION
Renal  blood  flow  normally  drains  ~20%  of  the  cardiac  output,  or  
1000 mL/min. Blood reaches each nephron through the afferent arte-
riole  leading  into  a  glomerular  capillary  where  ultrafiltration  forms 
the tubular fluid. The distal ends of the glomerular capillaries coalesce 
to form an efferent arteriole leading to the first segment of a second 
capillary  network  (cortical  peritubular  capillaries  or  medullary  vasa 
recta) surrounding the tubules (Fig. 309-2A). Thus, nephrons have two 
capillary  beds  arranged  in  a  series  separated  by  the  efferent  arteriole 
that regulates the hydrostatic pressure in both capillary beds. The distal 
capillaries empty into small venous branches that coalesce into larger 
veins to eventually form the renal vein.

The  hydrostatic  pressure  gradient  across  the  glomerular  capillary 
wall  is  the  primary  driving  force  for  glomerular  filtration.  Oncotic 
pressure within the capillary lumen, determined by the concentration 
of unfiltered plasma proteins, partially offsets the hydrostatic pressure 
gradient  and  opposes  filtration.  As  the  oncotic  pressure  rises  along 
the  length  of  the  glomerular  capillary,  the  driving  force  for  filtration 

falls  to  zero  en  route  to  the  efferent  arteriole.  Approximately  20%  of 
the renal plasma flow is filtered into Bowman space, and the ratio of 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to renal plasma flow determines the 
filtration fraction. Several factors, mostly hemodynamic, contribute to 
the regulation of filtration under physiologic conditions.

Although glomerular filtration is affected by renal artery pressure, 
this  relationship  is  not  linear  across  the  range  of  physiologic  blood 
pressures due to autoregulation of GFR. Autoregulation of glomerular 
filtration is the result of three major factors that modulate either affer-
ent  or  efferent  arteriolar  tone;  these  include  an  autonomous  vasore-
active  (myogenic)  reflex  in  the  afferent  arteriole,  tubuloglomerular 
feedback (TGF), and angiotensin II–mediated vasoconstriction of the 
efferent arteriole. The myogenic reflex is a first line of defense against 
fluctuations in renal blood flow. Acute changes in renal perfusion pres-
sure evoke reflex constriction or dilatation of the afferent arteriole in 
response to rising or falling pressure, respectively. This phenomenon 
helps protect the glomerular capillary from sudden changes in systolic 
pressure.

TGF changes the rate of filtration and tubular flow by reflex vaso-
constriction  or  dilatation  of  the  afferent  arteriole.  TGF  is  mediated 
by  specialized  cells  in  the  thick  ascending  limb  of  the  loop  of  Henle 
called  the  macula  densa  that  act  as  sensors  of  solute  concentration 
and tubular fluid flow rate. With high tubular flow rates, a proxy for 
an  inappropriately  high  filtration  rate,  greater  solute  delivery  to  the 
macula  densa  (Fig.  309-2B)  evokes  vasoconstriction  of  the  afferent 
arteriole  causing  GFR  to  return  toward  normal.  One  component  of 
the  soluble  signal  from  the  macula  densa  is  adenosine  triphosphate 
(ATP) released by the cells during increased NaCl reabsorption. ATP 
is metabolized in the extracellular space to generate adenosine, a potent 
vasoconstrictor of the afferent arteriole. During conditions associated 
with a fall in filtration rate, a lower rate of solute delivery to the macula 
densa attenuates TGF, allowing afferent arteriolar dilatation and restor-
ing GFR to normal levels. Angiotensin II and reactive oxygen species 
enhance TGF, whereas nitric oxide (NO) blunts TGF. A distinct feed-
back  mechanism  may  exist  between  the  connecting  tubule  and  GFR 
in which high Na+ delivery evokes afferent arteriolar dilation possibly 
mediated by prostaglandins.

The  third  component  underlying  autoregulation  of  GFR  involves 
angiotensin  II.  During  states  of  reduced  renal  blood  flow,  renin  is 
released  from  granular  cells  within  the  wall  of  the  afferent  arteriole 
near the macula densa in a region called the juxtaglomerular apparatus 
(Fig. 309-2B). Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, catalyzes the conversion of 
angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is subsequently converted to 
angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (Fig. 309-2C). 
Angiotensin  II  evokes  vasoconstriction  of  the  efferent  arteriole,  and 
the  resulting  increased  glomerular  hydrostatic  pressure  elevates  GFR 
to normal levels.

MECHANISMS OF RENAL TUBULAR 
TRANSPORT
The renal tubules are composed of highly differentiated epithelia that 
vary in morphology and function along the nephron (Fig. 309-3). The 
cells lining the various tubular segments form monolayers connected 
to  one  another  by  a  specialized  region  of  the  adjacent  lateral  mem-
branes called the tight junction. Tight junctions form an occlusive bar-
rier that separates the lumen of the tubule from the interstitial spaces 
surrounding  the  tubule  and  also  apportions  the  cell  membrane  into 
discrete domains: the apical membrane facing the tubular lumen and 
the basolateral membrane facing the interstitium. This regionalization 
allows cells to allocate membrane proteins and lipids asymmetrically. 
Owing  to  this  feature,  renal  epithelial  cells  are  said  to  be  polarized. 
The asymmetric assignment of membrane proteins, especially proteins 
mediating transport processes, provides the machinery for directional 
movement of fluid and solutes by the nephron.
 ■ EPITHELIAL SOLUTE TRANSPORT
There  are  two  types  of  epithelial  transport.  Movement  of  fluid  and 
solutes  sequentially  across  the  apical  and  basolateral  cell  membranes 
(or vice versa) mediated by transporters, channels, or pumps is called 

cellular transport. By contrast, movement of fluid and solutes through 
the  narrow  passageway  between  adjacent  cells  is  called  paracellular 
transport. Paracellular transport occurs through tight junctions, indi-
cating that they are not completely “tight” or occlusive. Indeed, some 
epithelial cell layers allow rather robust paracellular transport to occur 
(leaky  epithelia),  whereas  other  epithelia  have  more  restrictive  tight 
junctions  (tight  epithelia).  In  addition,  because  the  ability  of  ions  to 
flow through the paracellular pathway determines the electrical resis-
tance across the epithelial monolayer, leaky and tight epithelia are also 
referred to as low- or high-resistance epithelia, respectively. The prox-
imal tubule contains leaky epithelia, whereas distal nephron segments, 
such as the collecting duct, contain tight epithelia. Leaky epithelia are 
most  well  suited  for  bulk  fluid  reabsorption,  whereas  tight  epithelia 
allow for more refined control and regulation of transport.

 ■ MEMBRANE TRANSPORT
Cell membranes are composed of hydrophobic lipids that repel water 
and  aqueous  solutes.  The  movement  of  solutes  and  water  across  cell 
membranes is made possible by discrete classes of integral membrane 
proteins, including channels, pumps, and transporters. These different 
mechanisms  mediate  specific  types  of  transport  activities,  including

2290 active  transport  (pumps),  passive  transport  (channels),  facilitated  dif-
fusion (transporters), and secondary active transport (cotransporters). 
Active transport requires metabolic energy generated by the hydrolysis 
of ATP. Active transport pumps are ion-translocating ATPases, includ-
ing the ubiquitous Na+/K+-ATPase, the H+-ATPases, and Ca2+-ATPases. 
Active  transport  creates  asymmetric  ion  concentrations  across  a  cell 
membrane and can move ions against a chemical gradient. The poten-
tial  energy  stored  in  a  concentration  gradient  of  an  ion  such  as  Na+ 
can be used to drive transport through other mechanisms (secondary 
active  transport).  The  movement  of  solutes  through  a  membrane 
protein by simple diffusion is called passive transport. This activity is 
mediated by channels created by selectively permeable membrane pro-
teins, and it allows solute or water to move across a membrane driven 
by favorable concentration gradients or electrochemical potential. Facil-
itated diffusion is a specialized type of passive transport mediated by 
simple transporters called carriers or  uniporters. For example, hexose 
transporters such as GLUT2 mediate glucose transport by tubular cells. 
These  transporters  are  driven  by  the  concentration  gradient  for  glu-
cose that is highest in extracellular fluids and lowest in the cytoplasm  
due to rapid metabolism. Many other transporters operate by translo-
cating two or more ions/solutes in concert either in the same direction 
(symporters or cotransporters) or in opposite directions (antiporters or 
exchangers) across the cell membrane. The movement of two or more 
ions/solutes may produce no net change in the balance of electrostatic 
charges across the membrane (electroneutral), or a transport event may 
alter the balance of charges (electrogenic). Several inherited disorders 
of renal tubular solute and water transport occur as a consequence of 
mutations  in  genes  encoding  a  variety  of  channels,  transporter  pro-
teins, and their regulators (Table 309-1).

SEGMENTAL NEPHRON FUNCTIONS
Each  anatomic  segment  of  the  nephron  has  unique  characteristics 
and  specialized  functions  enabling  selective  transport  of  solutes  and 
water  (Fig.  309-3A).  Through  sequential  events  of  reabsorption  and 
secretion along the nephron, tubular fluid is progressively conditioned 
into  urine.  Knowledge  of  the  major  tubular  mechanisms  responsible 
for solute and water transport is critical for understanding hormonal 
regulation of kidney function and the pharmacologic manipulation of 
renal excretion.

PROXIMAL TUBULE
The  proximal  tubule  is  responsible  for  reabsorbing  ~60%  of  filtered 
NaCl and water, as well as ~90% of filtered bicarbonate and most crit-
ical  nutrients  such  as  glucose  and  amino  acids.  The  proximal  tubule 
uses both cellular and paracellular transport mechanisms. The apical 
membrane  of  proximal  tubular  cells  has  an  expanded  surface  area 
available for reabsorption created by a dense array of microvilli called 
the brush border, and leaky tight junctions enable high-capacity fluid 
reabsorption.

Solute  and  water  pass  through  these  tight  junctions  to  enter  the 
lateral  intercellular  space  where  absorption  by  the  peritubular  cap-
illaries  occurs.  Bulk  fluid  reabsorption  by  the  proximal  tubule  is 
driven  by  high  oncotic  pressure  and  low  hydrostatic  pressure  within 
the  peritubular  capillaries.  Cellular  transport  of  most  solutes  by  the 
proximal  tubule  is  coupled  to  the  Na+  concentration  gradient  estab-
lished  by  the  activity  of  a  basolateral  Na+/K+-ATPase  (Fig.  309-3B). 
This  active  transport  mechanism  maintains  a  steep  Na+  gradient  by 
keeping intracellular Na+ concentrations low. Solute reabsorption from 
the  tubular  lumen  is  coupled  to  the  Na+  gradient  by  Na+-dependent

transporters  such  as  Na+-glucose  and  Na+-phosphate  cotransporters 
present  in  apical  membranes.  In  addition  to  the  paracellular  route, 
water  reabsorption  also  occurs  through  the  cellular  pathway  enabled 
by constitutively active water channels (aquaporin-1) present on both 
apical and basolateral membranes.

Proximal  tubular  cells  reclaim  nearly  all  filtered  bicarbonate  by  a 
mechanism  dependent  on  carbonic  anhydrases.  Filtered  bicarbonate 
is  first  titrated  by  protons  delivered  to  the  lumen  mainly  by  Na+/H+ 
exchange. The resulting carbonic acid (H2CO3) is metabolized by brush 
border  carbonic  anhydrase  to  water  and  carbon  dioxide.  Dissolved 
carbon  dioxide  then  diffuses  into  the  cell,  where  it  is  enzymatically 
hydrated by cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase to re-form carbonic acid. 
Finally,  intracellular  carbonic  acid  dissociates  into  free  protons  and 
bicarbonate anions, and bicarbonate exits the cell through a basolateral 
Na+/HCO3
− cotransporter. This process is saturable, which can result in 
renal bicarbonate excretion when plasma levels exceed the physiologi-
cally normal range (24–26 meq/L). Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such 
as acetazolamide, a class of weak diuretic agents, block proximal tubule 
bicarbonate reabsorption and are useful for alkalinizing the urine.

The  proximal  tubule  contributes  to  acid  secretion  by  two  mecha-
nisms  involving  the  titration  of  the  urinary  buffers  ammonia  (NH3) 
and phosphate. Renal NH3 is produced by glutamine metabolism in the 
proximal tubule. Subsequent diffusion of NH3 out of the proximal tubu-
lar cell enables trapping of H+, which is secreted by Na+/H+ exchange, 
+).  Cellular  K+  levels  inversely 
in  the  lumen  as  ammonium  ion  (NH4
modulate proximal tubular ammoniagenesis, and in the setting of high 
serum  K+  from  hypoaldosteronism,  reduced  ammoniagenesis  pro-
motes type IV renal tubular acidosis. Filtered hydrogen phosphate ion 
2−) is also titrated in the proximal tubule by secreted H+ to form 
(HPO4
−, and this reaction constitutes a major component of the urinary 
H2PO4
buffer referred to as titratable acid. Most filtered phosphate ion is reab-
sorbed by the proximal tubule through a sodium-coupled cotransport 
process that is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH).

Chloride  is  poorly  reabsorbed  throughout  the  first  segment  of 
the proximal tubule, and a rise in Cl− concentration counterbalances 
the  removal  of  bicarbonate  anion  from  tubular  fluid.  In  later  proxi-
mal  tubular  segments,  cellular  Cl−  reabsorption  is  initiated  by  apical 
exchange of cellular formate for higher luminal concentrations of Cl−.

Once  in  the  lumen,  formate  anions  are  titrated  by  H+  (provided  by 
Na+/H+ exchange) to generate neutral formic acid, which can diffuse 
passively across the apical membrane back into the cell where it disso-
ciates a proton and is recycled. Basolateral Cl− exit is mediated by a K+/
Cl− cotransporter.

Reabsorption  of  glucose  is  nearly  complete  by  the  end  of  the 
proximal  tubule.  Cellular  transport  of  glucose  is  mediated  by  apical 
Na+-glucose cotransport coupled with basolateral, facilitated diffusion 
by a glucose transporter. This process is also saturable, leading to glyco-
suria when plasma levels exceed 180–200 mg/dL, as seen in untreated 
diabetes  mellitus.  Inhibitors  of  the  Na+-glucose  cotransporter  SLGT2 
in proximal tubules block glucose reabsorption and lower blood glu-
cose, which has therapeutic benefits in diabetes mellitus and chronic 
diabetic kidney disease.

The proximal tubule possesses specific transporters capable of secret-
ing  a  variety  of  organic  acids  (carboxylate  anions)  and  bases  (mostly 
primary amine cations). Organic anions transported by these systems 
include  several  protein-bound  drugs  not  filtered  at  the  glomerulus 
(penicillins, cephalosporins, and salicylates). Probenecid inhibits renal 
organic  anion  secretion  and  was  historically  used  to  elevate  plasma 
concentrations  of  certain  drugs  such  as  penicillin  and  oseltamivir. 
Organic cations secreted by the proximal tubule include various bio-
genic amine neurotransmitters (dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrine, 
norepinephrine,  and  histamine)  and  creatinine.  The  ATP-dependent 
transporter  P-glycoprotein  is  expressed  in  brush  border  membranes 
and  secretes  several  medically  important  drugs,  including  cyclo-
sporine,  digoxin,  tacrolimus,  and  various  cancer  chemotherapeutic 
agents. Certain drugs like cimetidine and trimethoprim compete with

endogenous compounds for transport by the organic cation pathways. 
Although these drugs elevate serum creatinine levels, there is no actual 
change in GFR in this setting.

Calcium and phosphorus homeostasis depends on normal function-
ing of the proximal tubule. Approximately 60–70% of filtered calcium 
and ~85% of filtered phosphorus (in the form of inorganic phosphate) 
are reabsorbed by the proximal tubule. Whereas calcium reabsorption 
is  mostly  by  passive  diffusion  through  the  paracellular  route,  phos-
phate  reabsorption  is  mediated  by  sodium-coupled  cotransport.  In 
addition  to  direct  reabsorption,  the  proximal  tubule  contributes  to 
systemic mineral balance by participating in specific endocrine path-
ways. Circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D (calcidiol) is bioactivated by 
proximal tubular 1α-hydroxylase to produce 1,25-di-hydroxy vitamin 
D (calcitriol), the most active form of the hormone, which acts on the 
small  intestine  to  promote  calcium  absorption.  Phosphate  balance 
is  affected  by  circulating  fibroblast  growth  hormone  23  (FGF23),  a 
bone-derived  hormone  that  interacts  with  its  receptor  (FGFR1)  and 
co-receptor  (Klotho)  on  proximal  tubular  cells  to  suppress  sodium-
phosphate  cotransport  and  promote  renal  phosphate  excretion.  PTH 
stimulates  proximal  tubular  1α-hydroxylation  of  vitamin  D,  whereas 
it  suppresses  sodium-phosphate  cotransport.  Derangements  in  PTH 
and  FGF23  account  for  abnormal  calcium  and  phosphate  balance  in 
chronic kidney disease.

The proximal tubule, through distinct classes of Na+-dependent and 
Na+-independent transport systems, reabsorbs amino acids efficiently. 
These transporters are specific for different groups of amino acids. For 
example, cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine are transported by a 
system comprising two proteins encoded by the SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 
genes.  Mutations  in  either  SLC3A1  or  SLC7A9  impair  reabsorption 
of  these  amino  acids  and  cause  the  disease  cystinuria.  Peptide  hor-
mones,  such  as  insulin  and  growth  hormone,  β2-microglobulin,  and 
other  small  proteins,  are  taken  up  by  the  proximal  tubule  through 
a  process  of  absorptive  endocytosis  and  are  degraded  in  acidified 
endocytic lysosomes. Acidification of these vesicles depends on a vac-
uolar H+-ATPase and Cl− channel. Impaired acidification of endocytic 
vesicles  because  of  mutations  in  a  Cl−  channel  gene  (CLCN5)  causes 
low-molecular-weight proteinuria in Dent’s disease.

LOOP OF HENLE
The loop of Henle consists of three major segments: descending thin 
limb,  ascending  thin  limb,  and  ascending  thick  limb.  Approximately 
15–25% of filtered NaCl is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, mainly by 
the thick ascending limb. The loop of Henle has an important role in 
urinary concentration by contributing to the generation of a hyperto-
nic medullary interstitium in a process called countercurrent multipli-
cation. The loop of Henle is the site of action for the most potent class 
of diuretic agents (loop diuretics) and also contributes to reabsorption 
of calcium and magnesium ions.

The  descending  thin  limb  is  highly  water  permeable  owing  to 
dense expression of constitutively active aquaporin-1 water channels. 
By  contrast,  water  permeability  is  negligible  in  the  ascending  limb. 
In the thick ascending limb, there is a high level of secondary active 
NaCl  transport  enabled  by  the  Na+/K+/2Cl−  cotransporter  on  the 
apical membrane in series with basolateral Cl− channels and Na+/K+- 
ATPase (Fig. 309-3C). The Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter is the primary 
target for loop diuretics. Tubular fluid K+ is the limiting substrate for 
this  cotransporter  (tubular  concentration  of  K+  is  similar  to  plasma,  
~4  meq/L),  but  transporter  activity  is  maintained  by  K+  recycling 
through an apical potassium channel. The cotransporter also enables 
+ in lieu of K+, and this leads to accumulation of 
reabsorption of NH4
+ and NH3 in the medullary interstitium. An inherited disor-
both NH4
der of the thick ascending limb, Bartter’s syndrome, is a salt-wasting 
renal  disease  associated  with  hypokalemia  and  metabolic  alkalosis. 
Loss-of-function  mutations  in  one  of  five  distinct  genes  encoding 
components  of  the  Na+/K+/2Cl−  cotransporter  (NKCC2),  apical  K+ 
channel (KCNJ1), basolateral Cl− channel (CLCNKB, BSND), or calcium- 
sensing receptor (CASR) can cause Bartter’s syndrome.

Potassium  recycling  also  contributes  to  a  positive  electrostatic 
charge in the lumen relative to the interstitium that promotes divalent

cation  (Mg2+  and  Ca2+)  reabsorption  through  a  paracellular  pathway. 
A  Ca2+-sensing,  G  protein–coupled  receptor  (CaSR)  on  basolateral 
membranes  regulates  NaCl  reabsorption  in  the  thick  ascending  limb 
through  dual  signaling  mechanisms  using  either  cyclic  AMP  or 
eicosanoids. This receptor enables a steep relationship between plasma 
Ca2+  levels  and  renal  Ca2+  excretion.  Loss-of-function  mutations  in 
CaSR cause familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria because of a blunted 
response of the thick ascending limb to extracellular Ca2+. Mutations 
in  CLDN16  encoding  paracellin-1,  a  transmembrane  protein  located 
within the tight junction complex, leads to familial hypomagnesemia 
with  hypercalciuria  and  nephrocalcinosis,  suggesting  that  the  ion 
conductance of the paracellular pathway in the thick limb is regulated.
The  loop  of  Henle  contributes  to  urine-concentrating  ability  by 
establishing  a  hypertonic  medullary  interstitium  that  promotes  water 
reabsorption  by  the  downstream  inner  medullary  collecting  duct. 
Countercurrent multiplication produces a hypertonic medullary inter-
stitium using two countercurrent systems: the loop of Henle (opposing 
descending and ascending limbs) and the vasa recta (medullary peritu-
bular capillaries enveloping the loop). The countercurrent flow in these 
two systems helps maintain the hypertonic environment of the inner 
medulla,  but  NaCl  reabsorption  by  the  thick  ascending  limb  is  the 
primary initiating event. Reabsorption of NaCl without water dilutes 
the tubular fluid and adds new osmoles to medullary interstitial fluid. 
Because the descending thin limb is highly water permeable, osmotic 
equilibrium occurs between the descending limb tubular fluid and the 
interstitial  space,  leading  to  progressive  solute  trapping  in  the  inner 
medulla. Maximum medullary interstitial osmolality also requires par-
tial recycling of urea from the collecting duct.

DISTAL CONVOLUTED TUBULE
The distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ~5% of the filtered NaCl. This 
segment is composed of a tight epithelium with little water permeabil-
ity.  The  major  NaCl-transporting  pathway  uses  an  apical  membrane, 
electroneutral thiazide-sensitive Na+/Cl− cotransporter in tandem with 
basolateral  Na+/K+-ATPase  and  Cl−  channels  (Fig.  309-3D).  Apical 
Ca2+-selective  channels  (TRPV5)  and  basolateral  Na+/Ca2+  exchange 
mediate  calcium  reabsorption  in  the  distal  convoluted  tubule.  Ca2+ 
reabsorption is inversely related to Na+ reabsorption and is stimulated 
by PTH. Blocking apical Na+/Cl− cotransport will reduce intracellular 
Na+, favoring increased basolateral Na+/Ca2+ exchange and passive api-
cal  Ca2+  entry.  Loss-of-function  mutations  of  SLC12A3  encoding  the 
apical Na+/Cl− cotransporter cause Gitelman syndrome, a salt-wasting 
disorder  associated  with  hypokalemic  alkalosis  and  hypocalciuria. 
Mutations  in  TRPM6  encoding  Mg2+  permeable  ion  channels  also 
cause familial hypomagnesemia with hypocalcemia. A molecular com-
plex of TRPM6 and TRPM7 proteins is critical for Mg2+ reabsorption 
in the distal convoluted tubule.

COLLECTING DUCT
The  collecting  duct  modulates  the  final  composition  of  urine.  The 
two major divisions, the cortical collecting duct and inner medullary 
collecting  duct,  contribute  to  reabsorbing  ~4–5%  of  filtered  Na+  and 
are important for hormonal regulation of salt and water balance. Cells 
in both segments of the collecting duct express vasopressin-regulated 
water  channels  (aquaporin-2  on  the  apical  membrane,  aquaporin-3 
and -4 on the basolateral membrane). The antidiuretic hormone vaso-
pressin  binds  to  the  V2  receptor  on  the  basolateral  membrane  and 
triggers an intracellular signaling cascade through G protein–mediated 
activation of adenylyl cyclase, which raises intracellular levels of cyclic 
AMP. This signaling cascade stimulates the insertion of water channels 
into the apical membrane of collecting duct cells to promote water per-
meability,  water  reabsorption,  and  production  of  concentrated  urine. 
In the absence of vasopressin, collecting duct cells are water imperme-
able, and urine remains dilute.

The  cortical  collecting  duct  contains  high-resistance  epithelia  with 
two  cell  types.  Principal  cells  are  the  main  water-reabsorbing,  Na+- 
reabsorbing, and K+-secreting cells, and the site of action of aldoster-
one, K+-sparing diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists 
such as spironolactone and eplerenone. The other cells are type A and

2294 B  intercalated  cells.  Type  A  intercalated  cells  mediate  acid  secretion 
and  bicarbonate  reabsorption  also  under  the  influence  of  aldoster-
one. Type B intercalated cells mediate bicarbonate secretion and acid 
reabsorption.

Virtually all transport is mediated through the cellular pathway for 
both  principal  cells  and  intercalated  cells.  In  principal  cells,  passive 
apical Na+ entry occurs through an amiloride-sensitive, epithelial Na+ 
channel (ENaC) with basolateral exit mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase 
(Fig.  309-3E).  This  Na+  reabsorptive  process  is  tightly  regulated  by 
aldosterone and is physiologically activated by a variety of proteolytic 
enzymes  that  cleave  extracellular  domains  of  ENaC;  plasmin  in  the 
tubular fluid of nephrotic patients, for example, activates ENaC, lead-
ing to sodium retention. Aldosterone enters the cell across the basolat-
eral membrane, binds to a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor, and 
then translocates into the nucleus, where it modulates gene transcrip-
tion, which potentiates Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion. Activating 
mutations  in  ENaC  increase  Na+  reclamation  and  produce  hypoka-
lemia, hypertension, and metabolic alkalosis (Liddle’s syndrome). The 
potassium-sparing  diuretics  amiloride  and  triamterene  block  ENaC, 
resulting in lower Na+ reabsorption.

Principal  cells  secrete  K+  through  an  apical  membrane  potassium 
channel. Several forces govern the secretion of K+. Most importantly, 
the  high  intracellular  K+  concentration  generated  by  Na+/K+-ATPase 
creates a favorable concentration gradient for K+ secretion into tubular 
fluid. With reabsorption of Na+ without an accompanying anion, the 
tubular  lumen  becomes  negative  relative  to  the  cell  interior,  creating 
a  favorable  electrical  gradient  for  secretion  of  potassium.  When  Na+ 
reabsorption is blocked, the electrical component of the driving force 
for  K+  secretion  is  blunted,  and  this  explains  lack  of  excess  urinary 
K+  loss  during  treatment  with  potassium-sparing  diuretics  or  min-
eralocorticoid  receptor  antagonists.  K+  secretion  is  also  promoted 
by  aldosterone  actions  that  potentiate  regional  Na+  transport,  which 
favor  more  lumen  electronegativity,  and  by  increasing  the  number 
and  activity  of  potassium  channels.  Fast  tubular  fluid  flow  rates  that 
occur during volume expansion or diuretics acting “upstream” of the 
cortical  collecting  duct  also  promote  K+  secretion,  as  does  the  pres-
ence of relatively nonreabsorbable anions (including bicarbonate and 
semisynthetic penicillins) that contribute to the lumen-negative poten-
tial. Off-target effects of certain antibiotics, such as trimethoprim and 
pentamidine, block ENaCs and predispose to hyperkalemia, especially 
when renal K+ handling is impaired for other reasons. Principal cells, 
as described below, also participate in water reabsorption in response 
to vasopressin.

Intercalated cells do not participate in Na+ reabsorption but instead 
mediate acid-base balance. These cells perform two types of transport: 
active H+ transport mediated by H+-ATPase (proton pump) and Cl−/
− exchange. Intercalated cells arrange the two transport mecha-
HCO3
nisms on opposite membranes to enable either acid or base secretion. 
Type  A  intercalated  cells  have  an  apical  proton  pump  that  mediates 
acid secretion and a basolateral Cl−/HCO3
− anion exchanger for bicar-
bonate reabsorption (Fig. 309-3E). Aldosterone increases the number 
of H+-ATPase pumps, sometimes contributing to the development of 
metabolic alkalosis. Secreted H+ is buffered by NH3 that has diffused 
into the collecting duct lumen from the surrounding interstitium. By 
contrast, type B intercalated cells have the Cl−/HCO3
− exchanger on the 
apical  membrane  to  mediate  bicarbonate  secretion  while  the  proton 
pump resides on the basolateral membrane to enable H+ reabsorption. 
Under  conditions  of  acidemia,  the  kidney  preferentially  uses  type  A 
intercalated  cells  to  secrete  the  excess  H+  and  generate  more  HCO3
−. 
The  opposite  is  true  in  states  of  bicarbonate  excess  with  alkalemia 
where the type B intercalated cells predominate. An extracellular pro-
tein called hensin mediates this adaptation.

Inner  medullary  collecting  duct  cells  share  many  similarities  with 
principal  cells  of  the  cortical  collecting  duct.  They  have  apical  Na+ 
and  K+  channels  that  mediate  Na+  reabsorption  and  K+  secretion, 
respectively  (Fig.  309-3F).  Sodium  reabsorption  by  inner  medullary 
collecting duct cells is also inhibited by the natriuretic peptides called 
atrial  natriuretic  peptide  or  renal  natriuretic  peptide  (urodilatin);  the 
same gene encodes both peptides but uses different posttranslational 

processing of a common preprohormone to generate different proteins. 
Atrial natriuretic peptides are secreted by atrial myocytes in response 
to  volume  expansion,  whereas  urodilatin  is  secreted  by  renal  tubular 
epithelia.  Natriuretic  peptides  interact  with  either  apical  (urodilatin) 
or  basolateral  (atrial  natriuretic  peptides)  receptors  on  inner  medul-
lary collecting duct cells to stimulate guanylyl cyclase and raise levels 
of  cytoplasmic  cGMP.  This  effect  in  turn  reduces  the  activity  of  the 
apical Na+ channel in these cells and attenuates net Na+ reabsorption, 
producing natriuresis.

The  inner  medullary  collecting  duct  transports  urea  out  of  the 
lumen, returning urea to the interstitium, where it contributes to the 
hypertonicity of the medullary interstitium. Urea is recycled by diffus-
ing from the interstitium into the descending and ascending limbs of 
the loop of Henle.

HORMONAL REGULATION OF SODIUM 
AND WATER BALANCE
The  balance  of  solute  and  water  in  the  body  is  determined  by  the 
amounts  ingested,  distributed  to  various  fluid  compartments,  and 
excreted by skin, bowel, and kidneys. Tonicity, the osmolar state deter-
mining the volume behavior of cells in a solution, is regulated by water 
balance (Fig. 309-4A), and extracellular blood volume is regulated by 
Na+ balance (Fig. 309-4B). The kidney is a critical modulator of both 
physiologic processes.

 ■ WATER BALANCE
Tonicity  depends  on  the  variable  concentration  of  effective  osmoles 
inside  and  outside  the  cell  causing  water  to  move  in  either  direction 
across  its  membrane.  Classic  effective  osmoles,  like  Na+,  K+,  and 
their  anions,  are  solutes  trapped  on  either  side  of  a  cell  membrane, 
where  they  collectively  partition  and  obligate  water  to  move  and 
find  equilibrium  in  proportion  to  retained  solute.  Normal  tonicity  
(~280  mosmol/L)  is  rigorously  defended  by  osmoregulatory  mecha-
nisms  that  control  water  balance  to  protect  tissues  from  inadvertent 
dehydration (cell shrinkage) or water intoxication (cell swelling), both 
of which impair cell function (Fig. 309-4A).

The  mechanisms  that  control  osmoregulation  are  distinct  from 
those  governing  extracellular  volume,  although  there  is  some  shared 
physiology in both processes. While cellular concentrations of K+ have 
a determinant role in any level of tonicity, the routine surrogate marker 
for assessing clinical tonicity is the concentration of serum Na+. Any 
reduction  in  total  body  water,  which  raises  the  Na+  concentration, 
triggers a brisk sense of thirst and conservation of water by decreas-
ing  renal  water  excretion  mediated  by  release  of  vasopressin  from 
the posterior pituitary. Conversely, a lower plasma Na+ concentration 
triggers  more  renal  water  excretion  by  suppressing  the  secretion  of 
vasopressin. Whereas all cells expressing mechanosensitive TRPV1, 2, 
or 4 channels, among potentially other sensors, respond to changes in 
tonicity by altering their volume and Ca2+ concentration, only TRPV+ 
neuronal  cells  connected  to  the  organum  vasculosum  of  the  lamina 
terminalis are osmoreceptive. Only these cells, because of their neural 
connectivity and adjacency to a minimal blood-brain barrier, modu-
late the downstream release of vasopressin by the posterior lobe of the 
pituitary gland. Secretion is stimulated primarily by changing tonicity 
and  secondarily  by  other  nonosmotic  signals  such  as  variable  blood 
volume,  stress,  pain,  nausea,  and  some  drugs.  The  release  of  vaso-
pressin by the posterior pituitary increases linearly as plasma tonicity 
rises above normal, although this varies, depending on the perception 
of extracellular volume (one form of cross-talk between mechanisms 
that  regulate  blood  volume  and  osmolality).  Changing  the  intake  or 
excretion of water provides a means for adjusting plasma tonicity; thus, 
osmoregulation governs water balance.

The  kidneys  contribute  to  maintaining  water  balance  through  the 
regulation  of  renal  water  excretion.  The  ability  to  concentrate  urine 
to an osmolality exceeding that of plasma enables water conservation, 
whereas the ability to produce urine more dilute than plasma promotes 
excretion of excess water. For water to enter or exit a cell, the cell mem-
brane must express aquaporins. In the kidney, aquaporin-1 is consti-
tutively active in all water-permeable segments (e.g., proximal tubule,

FIGURE 309-4  Determinants of sodium and water balance. A. Plasma Na+ concentration is a surrogate marker for plasma tonicity. Tonicity is determined by the number of 
effective osmoles in the body divided by the total body H2O (TB H2O), which translates simply into the total body Na (TB Na+) and anions outside the cell separated from the 
total body K (TB K+) inside the cell by the cell membrane. Net water balance is determined by the integrated functions of thirst, osmoreception, Na reabsorption, vasopressin 
release, and the strength of the medullary gradient in the kidney, keeping tonicity within a narrow range of osmolality (~280 mosmol/L). When water metabolism is disturbed 
and total body water increases, hyponatremia, hypotonicity, and water intoxication occur; when total body water decreases, hypernatremia, hypertonicity, and dehydration 
occur. B. Extracellular blood volume and pressure are an integrated function of total body Na+ (TB Na+), total body H2O (TB H2O), vascular tone, heart rate, and stroke 
volume that modulates volume and pressure in the vascular tree of the body. This extracellular blood volume is determined by net Na balance under the control of taste, 
baroreception, habit, Na+ reabsorption, macula densa/tubuloglomerular feedback, and natriuretic peptides. When Na+ metabolism is disturbed and total body Na+ increases, 
edema occurs; when total body Na+ is decreased, volume depletion occurs. ADH, antidiuretic hormone; AQP2, aquaporin-2.

descending thin limb of the loop of Henle), whereas aquaporin-2, -3, 
and -4 in the collecting duct promote vasopressin-regulated water per-
meability. Net water reabsorption is ultimately driven by the osmotic 
gradient  between  dilute  tubular  fluid  and  a  hypertonic  medullary 
interstitium.

 ■ SODIUM BALANCE
The  perception  of  extracellular  blood  volume  is  determined,  in  part,  
by the integration of arterial tone, cardiac stroke volume, heart rate, and 
the water and solute content of extracellular fluid. Na+ and accompa-
nying anions are the most abundant extracellular effective osmoles and 
together support a blood volume around which pressure is generated. 
Under normal conditions, this volume is regulated by sodium balance 
(Fig. 309-4B), and the balance between daily Na+ intake and excretion 
is  under  the  influence  of  baroreceptors  in  regional  blood  vessels  and 
vascular  hormone  sensors  modulated  by  atrial  natriuretic  peptides, 
the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system,  Ca2+  signaling,  adenosine, 
vasopressin, and the neural adrenergic axis. If Na+ intake exceeds Na+ 
excretion (positive Na+ balance), then a rising blood volume will trig-
ger a proportional increase in urinary Na+ excretion. Conversely, when 
Na+ intake is less than urinary excretion (negative Na+ balance), blood 
volume will fall and trigger enhanced renal Na+ reabsorption, leading 
to decreased urinary Na+ excretion.

The  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system  is  the  best-understood 
hormonal system modulating renal Na+ excretion. Renin is synthesized 
and secreted by granular cells in the wall of the afferent arteriole. Its 

secretion is controlled by several factors, including β1-adrenergic stim-
ulation to the afferent arteriole, input from the macula densa, and pros-
taglandins. Renin and ACE activity eventually produce angiotensin II 
that directly and indirectly promotes renal Na+ and water reabsorption. 
Stimulation  of  proximal  tubular  Na+/H+  exchange  by  angiotensin  II 
directly  increases  Na+  reabsorption.  Angiotensin  II  also  promotes 
Na+ reabsorption along the collecting duct by stimulating aldosterone 
secretion by the adrenal cortex. Constriction of the efferent glomerular 
arteriole by angiotensin II indirectly boosts the filtration fraction and 
raises  peritubular  capillary  oncotic  pressure  to  promote  tubular  Na+ 
reabsorption.  Finally,  angiotensin  II  inhibits  renin  secretion  through 
a  negative  feedback  loop.  Alternative  metabolism  of  angiotensin  by 
ACE2  generates  the  vasodilatory  peptide  angiotensin  1-7  that  acts 
through Mas receptors to counterbalance several actions of angiotensin 
II on blood pressure and renal function (Fig. 309-2C).

Aldosterone  is  synthesized  and  secreted  by  granulosa  cells  in  the 
adrenal  cortex.  It  binds  to  cytoplasmic  mineralocorticoid  receptors 
in the collecting duct principal cells and boosts the activity of ENaC, 
apical  membrane  K+  channel,  and  basolateral  Na+/K+-ATPase.  These 
effects  are  mediated  in  part  by  aldosterone-stimulated  transcription 
of the gene encoding serum/glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1). 
The activity of ENaC is increased by SGK1-mediated phosphorylation 
of Nedd4-2, a protein that promotes recycling of the Na+ channel from 
the plasma membrane. Phosphorylated Nedd4-2 has impaired interac-
tions with ENaC, leading to higher channel density at the plasma mem-
brane and greater capacity for Na+ reabsorption by the collecting duct.

Chronic  exposure  to  aldosterone  is  associated  with  lower  urinary 
Na+ excretion lasting only a few days, after which Na+ excretion returns 
to  previous  levels.  This  phenomenon,  called  aldosterone  escape,  is 
explained by lower proximal tubular Na+ reabsorption following blood 
volume expansion. Excess Na+ that is not reabsorbed by the proximal 
tubule  overwhelms  the  reabsorptive  capacity  of  more  distal  nephron 
segments. This escape may be facilitated by atrial natriuretic peptides 
that  lose  their  effectiveness  in  the  clinical  settings  of  heart  failure, 
nephrotic syndrome, and cirrhosis, leading to severe Na+ retention and 
volume overload.

Sushrut S. Waikar, Joseph V. Bonventre

Acute  kidney  injury  (AKI)  is  defined  by  the  impairment  of  kidney 
filtration and excretory function over days to weeks (generally known 
or  expected  to  have  occurred  within  7  days),  resulting  in  the  reten-
tion  of  nitrogenous  and  other  waste  products  normally  cleared  by 
the  kidneys.  AKI  is  not  a  single  disease  but  rather  a  designation  for 
a  heterogeneous  group  of  conditions  that  share  common  diagnostic 
features: specifically, an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) concentra-
tion often associated with a reduction in urine volume. It is important 
to recognize that AKI is a clinical diagnosis and not a structural one. 
A  patient  may  have  AKI  with  or  without  injury  to  the  kidney  par-
enchyma. AKI can range in severity from asymptomatic and transient 
changes in laboratory parameters of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 
to overwhelming and rapidly fatal derangements in the ability of the 
kidney  to  maintain  effective  circulating  volume  regulation,  excrete 
nitrogenous wastes and metabolic toxins, and maintain electrolyte and 
acid-base composition of the plasma.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
AKI complicates 5–7% of acute-care hospital admissions and up to 30% 
of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU). AKI severity is staged 
based on the magnitude of the rise in SCr and severity and duration 
of  oliguria  (Table  310-1).  The  incidence  of  AKI  has  grown  by  more 
than fourfold in the United States since 1988 and is estimated to have a 
yearly incidence of 500 per 100,000 population, higher than the yearly 
incidence of stroke. Large studies have shown that increases in SCr as 
low as 0.3 mg/dL in hospitalized patients are independently associated 
with  an  approximately  fourfold  increase  in  hospital  mortality,  with 
higher changes in creatine, and longer duration of elevation associated 
with  greater  increased  risk  of  morbidity  and  mortality.  Morbidity  of 
AKI in those admitted to the ICU exceeds 50% in many studies. AKI 
also has longer term implications even if the patient survives the hospi-
talization. AKI increases the risk for the development or worsening of 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and development of dialysis-requiring 
end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). AKI may also occur in the commu-
nity.  Common  causes  of  community-acquired  AKI  include  volume 
depletion, heart failure, adverse effects of medications, obstruction of

for hospital-acquired AKI are sepsis, major surgical procedures, criti-
cal illness involving heart or liver failure, and nephrotoxic medication 
administration.
 ■ AKI IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
AKI  is  also  a  major  medical  complication  in  the  developing  world, 
where  the  epidemiology  differs  from  that  in  developed  countries 
due  to  differences  in  demographics,  economics,  environmental  fac-
tors,  and  comorbid  disease  burden.  While  certain  features  of  AKI 
are  common  in  developed  and  developing  countries—particularly 
because  urban  centers  of  some  developing  countries  increasingly 
resemble those in the developed world—many etiologies for AKI are 
region-specific,  such  as  envenomations  from  snakes,  spiders,  cater-
pillars, and bees; infectious causes such as malaria and leptospirosis; 
and  crush  injuries  and  resultant  rhabdomyolysis  from  earthquakes. 
In developing countries, resources to diagnose and manage AKI are 
often limited.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The  causes  of  AKI  have  traditionally  been  divided  into  three  broad 
categories: prerenal azotemia, intrinsic renal parenchymal disease, and 
postrenal obstruction (Fig. 310-1).
 ■ PRERENAL AZOTEMIA
Prerenal azotemia (from “azo,” meaning nitrogen, and “-emia,” mean-
ing in the blood) is the most common form of AKI. It is the designation 
for a rise in SCr or BUN concentration due to inadequate renal plasma 
flow and intraglomerular hydrostatic pressure to support normal glo-
merular  filtration.  The  most  common  clinical  conditions  associated 
with prerenal azotemia are hypovolemia, decreased cardiac output, and 
medications that interfere with renal autoregulatory vascular responses 
such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and inhibitors 
of angiotensin II (Fig. 310-2). By definition, prerenal azotemia involves 
no parenchymal damage to the kidney and is rapidly reversible once 
parenchymal  blood  flow  and  intraglomerular  hemodynamics  are 
restored. In many cases, however, prerenal azotemia may coexist with 
other forms of intrinsic AKI associated with processes acting directly 
on the renal parenchyma. Prolonged periods of prerenal azotemia may 
lead to ischemic injury to the tubular cells with necrosis, hence termed 
acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

Normal GFR is maintained in part by renal blood flow and the rela-
tive resistances of the afferent and efferent renal arterioles, which deter-
mine the glomerular plasma flow rate and the transcapillary hydraulic 
pressure  gradient  that  drive  glomerular  ultrafiltration.  Mild  degrees 
of hypovolemia and reductions in cardiac output elicit compensatory 
renal physiologic changes. Because renal blood flow accounts for 20% 
of the cardiac output, renal vasoconstriction and salt and water reab-
sorption occur as homeostatic responses to decreased effective circu-
lating  volume  or  cardiac  output  in  order  to  maintain  blood  pressure 
and increase intravascular volume to sustain perfusion to the cerebral

and coronary vessels. Mediators of this response include angiotensin II, 
norepinephrine, and vasopressin (also termed antidiuretic hormone). 
Glomerular filtration can be maintained despite reduced renal blood 
flow by angiotensin II–mediated renal efferent vasoconstriction, which 
maintains  glomerular  capillary  hydrostatic  pressure  closer  to  normal 
and  thereby  prevents  marked  reductions  in  GFR  if  renal  blood  flow 
reduction is not excessive.

In  addition,  a  myogenic  reflex  within  the  afferent  arteriole  leads 
to  dilation  in  the  setting  of  low  perfusion  pressure,  thereby  main-
taining  glomerular  perfusion.  Intrarenal  biosynthesis  of  vasodilator 
prostaglandins (prostacyclin, prostaglandin E2), kallikrein and kinins, 
and possibly nitric oxide (NO) also increases in response to low renal 
perfusion pressure. Autoregulation is also accomplished by tubuloglo-
merular feedback, in which decreases in solute delivery to the macula 
densa  (specialized  cells  within  the  distal  tubule)  elicit  dilation  of  the 
juxtaposed  afferent  arteriole  in  order  to  maintain  glomerular  perfu-
sion, a mechanism mediated, in part, by NO. There is a limit, however, 
to  the  ability  of  these  counterregulatory  mechanisms  to  maintain 
GFR in the face of systemic hypotension. Even in healthy adults, renal 
autoregulation usually fails once the systolic blood pressure falls below 
80 mmHg.

A  number  of  factors  determine  the  robustness  of  the  autoregu-
latory  response  and  the  risk  of  prerenal  azotemia.  Atherosclerosis, 
long-standing hypertension, and older age can lead to hyalinosis and 
myointimal  hyperplasia,  causing  structural  narrowing  of  the  intrare-
nal  arterioles  and  impaired  capacity  for  renal  afferent  vasodilation. 
In  CKD,  renal  afferent  vasodilation  may  be  operating  at  maximal 
capacity in order to maximize GFR in response to reduced functional 
renal  mass.  Drugs  can  affect  the  compensatory  changes  evoked  to 
maintain  GFR.  NSAIDs  inhibit  renal  prostaglandin  production, 
limiting renal afferent vasodilation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE)  inhibitors  and  angiotensin  receptor  blockers  (ARBs)  limit 
renal efferent vasoconstriction; this effect is particularly pronounced 
in  patients  with  bilateral  renal  artery  stenosis  or  unilateral  renal 
artery stenosis (in the case of a solitary functioning kidney) because, 
as  indicated  above,  efferent  arteriolar  vasoconstriction  is  needed 
to  maintain  GFR  due  to  low  renal  perfusion.  The  combined  use  of 
NSAIDs with ACE inhibitors or ARBs poses a particularly high risk 
for developing prerenal azotemia.

Many  individuals  with  advanced  liver  disease  exhibit  a  hemo-
dynamic  profile  that  resembles  prerenal  azotemia  in  the  setting  of 

total-body volume overload. Systemic vascular resistance is markedly 
reduced due to primary arterial vasodilation in the splanchnic circu-
lation,  resulting  ultimately  in  activation  of  vasoconstrictor  responses 
similar to those seen in hypovolemia. AKI is a common complication 
in this setting, and it can be triggered by volume depletion and spon-
taneous bacterial peritonitis. A particularly poor prognosis is seen in 
the case of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, in which AKI persists despite 
volume administration and withholding of diuretics. Type 2 hepatore-
nal syndrome is a less severe form characterized mainly by refractory 
ascites. The hepatorenal syndrome, defined as it is above, is difficult to 
distinguish from prerenal azotemia.

 ■ INTRINSIC AKI
The  most  common  causes  of  intrinsic  AKI  are  sepsis,  ischemia,  and 
nephrotoxins,  both  endogenous  and  exogenous  (Fig.  310-3).  As 
mentioned  previously,  in  many  cases,  prerenal  azotemia  advances  to 
tubular injury. Although often the AKI is attributed to “acute tubular 
necrosis,” human biopsy confirmation of tubular necrosis is, in general, 
often lacking in cases of sepsis and ischemia; indeed, processes such as 
inflammation, apoptosis, and altered regional perfusion may be impor-
tant  contributors  pathophysiologically  without  frank  necrosis.  There 
are other potential causes of AKI in settings such as sepsis, including 
drug-induced  interstitial  nephritis  or  glomerulonephritis.  These  and 
other causes of intrinsic AKI can be catalogued anatomically according 
to the major site of renal parenchymal damage: glomeruli, tubuloint-
erstitium, and vessels.

 ■ SEPSIS-ASSOCIATED AKI
In  the  United  States,  more  than  1  million  cases  of  sepsis  occur  each 
year.  AKI  complicates  more  than  50%  of  cases  of  severe  sepsis  and 
greatly increases the risk of death. Sepsis is also a very important cause 
of  AKI  in  the  developing  world.  Decreases  in  GFR  with  sepsis  can 
occur even in the absence of overt hypotension, although many cases 
of severe AKI typically occur in the setting of hemodynamic compro-
mise requiring vasopressor support. While there can be tubular injury 
associated with AKI in sepsis as manifest by the presence of tubular 
debris  and  casts  in  the  urine,  postmortem  examinations  of  kidneys 
from individuals with severe sepsis suggest that other factors, perhaps 
related  to  inflammation,  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  and  interstitial 
edema,  must  also  be  considered  in  the  pathophysiology  of  sepsis- 
induced AKI.

The hemodynamic effects of sepsis—arising from generalized arte-
rial  vasodilation,  mediated  in  part  by  cytokines  that  upregulate  the 
expression of inducible NO synthase in the vasculature—can lead to a 
reduction in GFR. The operative mechanisms may be excessive efferent 
arteriole vasodilation, particularly early in the course of sepsis, or renal 
vasoconstriction  from  activation  of  the  sympathetic  nervous  system, 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or increased levels of vaso-
pressin  or  endothelin.  Sepsis  may  lead  to  endothelial  damage,  which 
results in increased microvascular leukocyte adhesion and migration, 
thrombosis,  permeability,  increased  interstitial  pressure,  reduction  in 
local flow to tubules, and activation of reactive oxygen species, all of 
which may injure renal tubular cells.

AKI can be an important complication of viral infections, such as 
hantavirus,  dengue  virus,  or  SARS-CoV-2.  The  pathophysiology  of 
AKI  due  to  viral  infections  remains  incompletely  understood.  As  an 
example, some have reported infection of the kidney with SARS-CoV-2 

while others have found less direct involvement. SARS-CoV-2 is asso-
ciated with a large release of cytokines into the circulation (“cytokine 
storm”), which may cause diffuse intrarenal vasoconstriction. Finally, 
there  is  a  generalized  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  SARS-
CoV-2 that may contribute to the impairment of intrarenal blood flow.

 ■ ISCHEMIA-ASSOCIATED AKI
Healthy  kidneys  receive  20%  of  the  cardiac  output  and  account  for 
10% of resting oxygen consumption, despite constituting only 0.5% of 
the human body mass. The kidneys are also the site of one of the most 
hypoxic regions in the body, the renal medulla. The outer medulla is 
particularly vulnerable to ischemic damage because of the architecture 
of  the  blood  vessels  that  supply  oxygen  and  nutrients  to  the  tubules. 
In  the  outer  medulla  enhanced  leukocyte-endothelial  interactions  in 
the  small  vessels  lead  to  inflammation  and  reduced  local  blood  flow 
to  the  metabolically  very  active  S3  segment  of  the  proximal  tubule,

which  depends  on  oxidative  metabolism  for  survival.  Mitochondrial 
dysfunction  due  to  ischemia  and  mitochondrial  release  of  reactive 
oxygen  species  also  play  a  role  in  renal  tubular  injury.  Transient 
ischemia  alone  in  a  normal  kidney  is  usually  not  sufficient  to  cause 
severe AKI, as evidenced by the relatively low risk of severe AKI even 
after  total  interruption  of  renal  blood  flow  during  suprarenal  aortic 
clamping or cardiac arrest. Clinically, AKI more commonly develops 
when  ischemia  occurs  in  the  context  of  limited  renal  reserve  (e.g., 
CKD  or  older  age)  or  coexisting  insults  such  as  sepsis,  vasoactive  or 
nephrotoxic  drugs,  rhabdomyolysis,  or  the  systemic  inflammatory 
states  associated  with  burns  and  pancreatitis.  Prerenal  azotemia  and 
ischemia-associated AKI represent a continuum of the manifestations 
of renal hypoperfusion. Persistent preglomerular vasoconstriction may 
be a common underlying cause of the reduction in GFR seen in AKI; 
implicated  factors  for  vasoconstriction  include  activation  of  tubulo-
glomerular feedback from enhanced delivery of solute to the macula 
densa following proximal tubule injury, increased basal vascular tone 
and  reactivity  to  vasoconstrictive  agents,  and  decreased  vasodilator 
responsiveness. Other contributors to low GFR include backleak of fil-
trate across damaged and denuded tubular epithelium and mechanical 
obstruction of tubules from necrotic debris (Fig. 310-4).

Postoperative AKI 
Ischemia-associated  AKI  is  a  serious  compli-
cation  in  the  postoperative  period,  especially  after  major  operations 
involving  significant  blood  loss  and  intraoperative  hypotension.  The 
procedures  most  commonly  associated  with  AKI  are  cardiac  surgery 
with  cardiopulmonary  bypass  (particularly  for  combined  valve  and 
bypass  procedures),  vascular  procedures  with  aortic  cross  clamping, 
and  intraperitoneal  procedures.  Severe  AKI  requiring  dialysis  occurs 
in ~1% of cardiac and vascular surgery procedures. The risk of severe 
AKI has been less well studied for major intraperitoneal procedures but 
appears to be of comparable magnitude. Common risk factors for post-
operative  AKI  include  underlying  CKD,  older  age,  diabetes  mellitus, 
congestive heart failure, and emergency procedures. The pathophysiol-
ogy of AKI following cardiac surgery is multifactorial. Major AKI risk 
factors are common in the population undergoing cardiac or vascular 
surgery.  Over  time,  more  of  these  surgical  procedures  are  performed 
on older patients with comorbidities that predispose them to AKI and 
hasten  progression  of  ESKD  if  they  develop  AKI.  Longer  duration  of 
cardiopulmonary bypass is a risk factor for AKI. In addition to ischemic 
injury  from  sustained  hypoperfusion,  cardiopulmonary  bypass  may 
cause AKI through a number of mechanisms including extracorporeal 
circuit activation of leukocytes and inflammatory processes, hemolysis

along  the  nephron  where  filtrate  water 
is  reabsorbed  and  in  the  medullary 
interstitium,  where  water  flows  from 
the  descending  blood  vessels  into  the 
concentrated  interstitium;  this  results  in 
high-concentration exposure of toxins to 
tubular, interstitial, and endothelial cells. 
Nephrotoxic injury occurs in response to 
a number of pharmacologic compounds 
with diverse structures, endogenous sub-
stances,  and  environmental  exposures. 
All structures of the kidney are vulnera-
ble to toxic injury, including the tubules, 
interstitium,  vasculature,  and  collecting 
system.  As  with  other  forms  of  AKI, 
risk  factors  for  nephrotoxicity  include 
older  age,  CKD,  and  prerenal  azotemia. 
Hypoalbuminemia may increase the risk 
of some forms of nephrotoxin-associated 
AKI  due  to  increased  free  circulating 
drug concentrations.

with resultant pigment nephropathy (see below), and aortic injury with 
resultant atheroemboli. AKI from atheroembolic disease, which can also 
occur following percutaneous catheterization of the aorta, or spontane-
ously, is due to cholesterol crystal embolization resulting in partial or 
total occlusion of multiple small arteries within the kidney. Over time, 
a  foreign  body  reaction  can  result  in  intimal  proliferation,  giant  cell 
formation, and further narrowing of the vascular lumen, accounting for 
the generally subacute (over a period of weeks rather than days) decline 
in  renal  function.  In  addition,  high  doses  of  exogenous  vasopressors 
and blood-product perfusion increase the risk of AKI. Mortality among 
cardiovascular patients who require renal replacement therapy can be 
as high as 40–70%. Even with milder forms of post-operative AKI there 
is an increased risk of subsequent progression to chronic kidney disease.
Burns  and  Acute  Pancreatitis  Extensive  fluid  losses  into  the 
extravascular  compartments  of  the  body  frequently  accompany  severe 
burns and acute pancreatitis. AKI is an ominous complication of burns, 
affecting 25% of individuals with >10% total body surface area involve-
ment.  In  addition  to  severe  hypovolemia  resulting  in  decreased  cardiac 
output and increased neurohormonal activation, burns and acute pancre-
atitis both lead to dysregulated inflammation and an increased risk of sep-
sis and acute lung injury, all of which may facilitate the development and 
progression of AKI. Individuals undergoing massive fluid resuscitation for 
trauma, burns, and acute pancreatitis can also develop abdominal com-
partment syndrome, where markedly elevated intraabdominal pressures, 
usually >20 mmHg, lead to renal vein compression and reduced GFR.
Diseases  of  the  Vasculature  Leading  to  Ischemia  These  dis-
eases  can  compromise  oxygen  and  metabolic  substrate  delivery  to 
the  tubules  and  glomeruli.  Microvascular  causes  of  AKI  include  the 
thrombotic  microangiopathies  (due  to  cocaine,  certain  chemothera-
peutic agents, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, radiation nephritis, 
malignant hypertensive nephrosclerosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura/hemolytic-uremic syndrome [TTP-HUS]), scleroderma, some 
chemotherapeutic  agents  and  atheroembolic  disease.  Large-vessel  dis-
eases associated with AKI include renal artery dissection, thromboem-
bolism, or thrombosis, and renal vein compression or thrombosis. Renal 
angiography  is  the  gold  standard  for  direct  visualization  of  the  renal 
vasculature and is important for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, 
large vessel vasculitis, fibromuscular disease, or renal vein obstruction.
 ■ NEPHROTOXIN-ASSOCIATED AKI
The kidney has very high susceptibility to nephrotoxic agents due to 
extremely high blood perfusion and concentration of filtered substances 

Contrast  Agents 
Iodinated  contrast 
agents used for cardiovascular and com-
puted  tomography  (CT)  imaging  are  a 
cause  of  AKI.  The  risk  of  AKI,  or  “con-
trast  nephropathy,”  is  negligible  in  those 
with normal renal function but increases in the setting of CKD, par-
ticularly  diabetic  nephropathy.  The  most  common  clinical  course  of 
contrast nephropathy is characterized by a rise in SCr beginning 24–48 
h following exposure, peaking within 3–5 days, and resolving within 1 
week. More severe, dialysis-requiring AKI is uncommon except in the 
setting of significant preexisting CKD, often in association with con-
gestive heart failure or other coexisting causes for ischemia-associated 
AKI. Patients with multiple myeloma and/or renal disease are particu-
larly susceptible. Low fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and rela-
tively benign urinary sediment without features of tubular necrosis (see 
below) are common findings. Contrast nephropathy is thought to occur 
from a combination of factors, including (1) hypoxia in the renal outer 
medulla due to perturbations in renal microcirculation and occlusion 
of small vessels; (2) cytotoxic damage to the tubules directly or via the 
generation of oxygen-free radicals, especially because the concentration 
of the agent within the tubule is markedly increased; and (3) transient 
tubule obstruction with precipitated contrast material. Other diagnos-
tic agents implicated as a cause of AKI are high-dose gadolinium used 
for  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  and  oral  sodium  phosphate 
solutions  used  as  bowel  purgatives.  Gadolinium  has  been  associated 
with  development  of  nephrogenic  systemic  fibrosis  (NSF)  in  subjects 
with  advanced  kidney  disease,  but  the  majority  of  these  cases  were 
associated  with  group  I  gadolinium-based  contrast  media,  which  are 
rarely used now in the United States and have been withdrawn from the 
market in many other countries. The risk of AKI associated with stan-
dard doses of group II gadolinium-based contrast media is very low.
Antibiotics  Several antimicrobial agents are commonly associated 
with AKI. Vancomycin may be associated with AKI from tubular injury, 
particularly when trough levels are high and when used in combination 
with  other  nephrotoxic  antibiotics.  Vancomycin  can  also  crystalize 
in  tubules  and  cause  intratubular  obstruction.  Aminoglycosides  and 
amphotericin  B  both  cause  tubular  necrosis.  Nonoliguric  AKI  (i.e., 
with a urine volume >400 mL/day) accompanies 10–30% of courses of 
aminoglycoside antibiotics, even when plasma levels are in the thera-
peutic range. Aminoglycosides are freely filtered across the glomerulus 
and  then  accumulate  within  the  renal  cortex,  where  concentrations 
can greatly exceed those of the plasma. AKI typically manifests after  
5–7 days of therapy and can present even after the drug has been dis-
continued. Hypomagnesemia is a common finding.

Amphotericin B causes renal vasoconstriction from an increase in 
tubuloglomerular feedback as well as direct tubular toxicity mediated 
by  reactive  oxygen  species.  Nephrotoxicity  from  amphotericin  B  is 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2300

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractdose and duration dependent. This drug binds to tubular membrane 
cholesterol and introduces pores. Clinical features of amphotericin B 
nephrotoxicity include polyuria, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and 
nongap metabolic acidosis.

Acyclovir  can  precipitate  in  tubules  and  cause  AKI  by  tubular 
obstruction,  particularly  when  given  as  an  intravenous  bolus  at  high 
doses (500 mg/m2) or in the setting of hypovolemia. Foscarnet, pentam-
idine, tenofovir, and cidofovir are also frequently associated with AKI 
due  to  tubular  toxicity.  AKI  secondary  to  acute  interstitial  nephritis 
can occur as a consequence of exposure to many antibiotics, including 
penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, sulfonamides, and rifampin.

Chemotherapeutic  Agents  Cisplatin  and  carboplatin  are  accu-
mulated  by  proximal  tubular  cells  and  cause  necrosis  and  apoptosis. 
Intensive hydration regimens have reduced the incidence of cisplatin 
nephrotoxicity, but it remains a dose-limiting toxicity. Ifosfamide may 
cause hemorrhagic cystitis and tubular toxicity, manifested as type II 
renal  tubular  acidosis  (Fanconi  syndrome),  polyuria,  hypokalemia, 
and  a  modest  decline  in  GFR.  Antiangiogenesis  agents,  such  as  bev-
acizumab,  can  cause  proteinuria  and  hypertension  via  injury  to  the 
glomerular  microvasculature  (thrombotic  microangiopathy).  Other 
antineoplastic agents such as mitomycin C and gemcitabine may cause 
thrombotic microangiopathy with resultant AKI. Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors,  such  as  ipilimumab,  tremelimumab,  nivolumab,  and  pem-
brolizumab can cause immune-related adverse events, often manifest-
ing in the kidney as acute interstitial nephritis.

Toxic Ingestions  Ethylene glycol, present in automobile antifreeze, 
is  metabolized  to  oxalic  acid,  glycolaldehyde,  and  glyoxylate,  which 
may cause AKI through direct tubular injury and tubular obstruction. 
Diethylene  glycol  is  an  industrial  agent  that  has  caused  outbreaks  of 
severe  AKI  around  the  world  due  to  adulteration  of  pharmaceutical 
preparations.  The  metabolite  2-hydroxyethoxyacetic  acid  (HEAA)  is 
thought to be responsible for tubular injury. Melamine contamination 
of foodstuffs has led to nephrolithiasis and AKI, either through intratu-
bular obstruction or possibly direct tubular toxicity. Aristolochic acid 
was found to be the cause of “Chinese herb nephropathy” and “Balkan 
nephropathy”  due  to  contamination  of  medicinal  herbs  or  farming. 
The  list  of  environmental  toxins  is  likely  to  grow  and  contribute  to 
a  better  understanding  of  previously  catalogued  “idiopathic”  chronic 
tubular interstitial disease, a common diagnosis in both the developed 
and developing world.

Endogenous Toxins  AKI may be caused by a number of endoge-
nous  compounds,  including  myoglobin,  hemoglobin,  uric  acid,  and 
myeloma  light  chains.  Myoglobin  can  be  released  by  injured  muscle 
cells,  and  hemoglobin  can  be  released  during  massive  hemolysis 
leading  to  pigment  nephropathy.  Rhabdomyolysis  may  result  from 
traumatic crush injuries, muscle ischemia during vascular or orthope-
dic  surgery,  compression  during  coma  or  immobilization,  prolonged 
seizure  activity,  excessive  exercise,  heat  stroke  or  malignant  hyper-
thermia,  infections,  metabolic  disorders  (e.g.,  hypophosphatemia, 
severe  hypothyroidism),  and  myopathies  (drug-induced,  metabolic, 
or  inflammatory).  Pathogenic  factors  for  AKI  due  to  endogenous 
toxins  include  intrarenal  vasoconstriction,  direct  proximal  tubular 
toxicity, and mechanical obstruction of the distal nephron lumen when 
myoglobin  or  hemoglobin  precipitates  with  Tamm-Horsfall  protein 
(uromodulin, the most common protein in urine and produced in the 
thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle), a process favored by acidic 
urine. Tumor lysis syndrome may follow initiation of cytotoxic therapy 
in patients with high-grade lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leu-
kemia; massive release of uric acid (with serum levels often exceeding 
15 mg/dL) leads to precipitation of uric acid in the renal tubules and 
AKI  (Chap.  75).  Other  features  of  tumor  lysis  syndrome  include 
hyperkalemia  and  hyperphosphatemia.  The  tumor  lysis  syndrome 
can also occasionally occur spontaneously or with treatment for solid 
tumors or multiple myeloma. Myeloma light chains can also cause AKI 
by  glomerular  damage  and/or  direct  tubular  toxicity  and  by  binding 
to  Tamm-Horsfall  protein  to  form  obstructing  intratubular  casts. 

Hypercalcemia,  which  can  also  be  seen  in  multiple  myeloma,  may 
cause AKI by intense renal vasoconstriction and volume depletion.

Other  Causes  of  Acute  Tubulointerstitial  Disease  Leading 
to AKI  While many of the ischemic and toxic causes of AKI previ-
ously described result in tubulointerstitial disease, many drugs are also 
associated with the development of an allergic response characterized 
by an inflammatory infiltrate and sometimes, peripheral and urinary 
eosinophilia. Proton pump inhibitors and NSAIDs are commonly used 
drugs that have been associated with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. 
AKI may be also caused by severe infections and infiltrative malignant 
or nonmalignant (e.g., sarcoidosis) diseases.

Anticoagulant-Related  Nephropathy  Excessive  anticoagula-
tion with warfarin or other classes of anticoagulants has been reported 
to cause AKI through glomerular hemorrhage resulting in the forma-
tion of obstructing red blood cell casts within the kidney tubule and 
tubular injury.

Glomerulonephritis  Diseases  involving  the  glomerular  podo-
cytes,  mesangial,  and/or  endothelial  cells  can  lead  to  AKI  by  com-
promising  the  filtration  barrier  and  blood  flow  within  the  renal 
circulation.  Although  glomerulonephritis  is  a  less  common  (~5%) 
cause of AKI, early recognition is particularly important because the 
diseases  can  respond  to  timely  treatment  with  immunosuppressive 
agents or therapeutic plasma exchange, and the treatment may reverse 
the AKI and decrease subsequent longer term injury.

 ■ POSTRENAL AKI
(See  also  Chap.  319)  Postrenal  AKI  occurs  when  the  normally  uni-
directional  flow  of  urine  is  acutely  blocked  either  partially  or  totally, 
leading  to  increased  retrograde  hydrostatic  pressure  and  interference 
with glomerular filtration. Obstruction to urinary flow may be caused 
by  functional  or  structural  derangements  anywhere  from  the  renal 
pelvis to the tip of the urethra (Fig. 310-5). Normal urinary flow rate 
does not rule out the presence of partial obstruction, because the GFR 
is normally two orders of magnitude higher than the urinary flow rate 
and hence a preservation of urine output may be misleading in hiding 
the postrenal partial obstruction. For moderate to severe AKI to occur 
in individuals with two healthy functional kidneys, obstruction must 
affect both kidneys in order to observe large increases in SCr, unless 
there  is  asymmetric  kidney  function  with  one  chronically  diseased, 
and  the  other  obstructed.  Unilateral  obstruction  may  cause  AKI  in 
the setting of significant underlying CKD or, in rare cases, from reflex 
vasospasm  of  the  contralateral  kidney.  Bladder  neck  obstruction  is  a 
common cause of postrenal AKI, which impacts both kidneys. This can 
be  due  to  prostate  disease  (benign  prostatic  hypertrophy  or  prostate 
cancer),  neurogenic  bladder,  or  therapy  with  anticholinergic  drugs. 
Obstructed Foley catheters can cause postrenal AKI if not recognized 
and obstruction relieved. Other causes of lower tract obstruction are 
blood  clots,  calculi,  and  urethral  strictures.  Ureteric  obstruction  can 
occur from intraluminal obstruction (e.g., calculi, blood clots, sloughed 
renal  papillae),  infiltration  of  the  ureteric  wall  (e.g.,  neoplasia),  or 
external compression (e.g., retroperitoneal fibrosis, neoplasia, abscess, 
or  inadvertent  surgical  damage).  The  pathophysiology  of  postrenal 
AKI involves hemodynamic alterations triggered by an abrupt increase 
in intratubular pressures. An initial period of hyperemia from afferent 
arteriolar dilation is followed by intrarenal vasoconstriction from the 
generation  of  angiotensin  II,  thromboxane  A2,  and  vasopressin,  and 
a  reduction  in  NO  production.  Secondary  reductions  in  glomerular 
function are due to underperfusion of glomeruli and, possibly, changes 
in the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient.

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION (TABLE 310-2)
By current definitions the presence of AKI is defined by an elevation 
in the SCr concentration or reduction in urine output. AKI is currently 
defined by a rise from baseline of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h or at 
least 50% higher than baseline within 1 week, or a reduction in urine 
output to <0.5 mL/kg per h for longer than 6 h. As indicated previously, 
it  is  important  to  recognize  that  given  this  definition,  some  patients

with  AKI  will  not  have  tubular  or  glomerular  damage  (e.g.,  prerenal 
azotemia).  The  distinction  between  AKI  and  CKD  is  important  for 
proper  diagnosis  and  treatment.  The  distinction  is  straightforward 
when a recent baseline SCr concentration is available, but more diffi-
cult in the many instances in which the baseline is unknown. In such 
cases, clues suggestive of CKD can come from radiologic studies (e.g., 
small, shrunken kidneys with cortical thinning on renal ultrasound, or 
evidence of renal osteodystrophy) or laboratory tests such as normo-
cytic anemia in the absence of blood loss or secondary hyperparathy-
roidism  with  hyperphosphatemia  and  hypocalcemia,  consistent  with 
CKD. No set of tests, however, can rule out AKI superimposed on CKD 
because AKI is a frequent complication in patients with CKD, further 
complicating  the  distinction.  Serial  blood  tests  showing  a  continued 
substantial rise of SCr represent clear evidence of AKI. Once the diag-
nosis of AKI is established, its cause needs to be determined because 
the elevation of SCr or reduction in urine output can be due to a large 
number of physiological and pathophysiological processes as described 
previously.
 ■ HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The clinical context, careful history taking, and physical examination 
often narrow the differential diagnosis for the cause of AKI. Prerenal 
azotemia  should  be  suspected  in  the  setting  of  vomiting,  diarrhea, 
glycosuria causing polyuria, and several medications including diuret-
ics, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs. Physical signs of orthostatic 
hypotension, tachycardia, reduced jugular venous pressure, decreased 
skin  turgor,  and  dry  mucous  membranes  are  often  present  in  prere-
nal  azotemia.  Congestive  heart  failure,  liver  disease,  and  nephrotic 
syndrome can be associated with reductions in renal blood flow and/
or  alterations  in  intrarenal  hemodynamics  leading  to  reduced  GFR. 
Extensive vascular disease raises the possibility of renal artery disease, 
especially if kidneys are known to be asymmetric in size. Atheroem-
bolic disease can be associated with livedo reticularis and other signs 
of  emboli  to  the  legs.  The  presence  of  sepsis  is  an  important  clue  to 
causation, although, as described above, the detailed pathophysiology 
may be multifactorial.

A history of prostatic disease, nephrolithiasis, or pelvic or paraaortic 
malignancy would suggest the possibility of postrenal AKI. Whether or 
not symptoms are present early during obstruction of the urinary tract 

depends  on  the  location  of  obstruc-
tion.  Colicky  flank  pain  radiating 
to  the  groin  suggests  acute  ureteric 
obstruction. Nocturia and urinary fre-
quency  or  hesitancy  can  be  seen  in 
prostatic  disease.  Abdominal  fullness 
and  suprapubic  pain  can  accompany 
bladder  enlargement.  Definitive  diag-
nosis  of  obstruction  requires  radio-
logic investigations.

A careful review of all medications 
is  imperative  in  the  evaluation  of  an 
individual  with  AKI.  Not  only  are 
medications  frequently  a  nephrotoxic 
cause  of  AKI,  but  doses  of  adminis-
tered  medications  must  be  adjusted 
for  reductions  in  kidney  function.  In 
this  regard,  it  is  important  to  recog-
nize  that  reductions  in  true  GFR  are 
not  reflected  by  equations  that  esti-
mate  GFR  because  those  equations 
are dependent on SCr and the patient 
being  in  a  steady  state.  With  AKI, 
changes in SCr will lag behind changes 
in  filtration  rate.  Idiosyncratic  reac-
tions to a wide variety of medications 
can lead to allergic interstitial nephri-
tis,  which  may  be  accompanied  by 
fever, arthralgias, and a pruritic eryth-
ematous rash. The absence of systemic 
features  of  hypersensitivity,  however,  does  not  exclude  the  diagnosis 
of interstitial nephritis, and a kidney biopsy should be considered for 
definitive diagnosis.

Obstructed Foley
catheter

Strictures

AKI accompanied by palpable purpura, pulmonary hemorrhage, or 
sinusitis raises the possibility of systemic vasculitis with glomerulone-
phritis. A history of autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus eryth-
ematosus, should lead to consideration of the possibility that the AKI is 
related to worsening of this underlying disease. Pregnancy should lead 
to the consideration of preeclampsia as a pathophysiological contribu-
tor to the AKI. A tense abdomen should prompt consideration of acute 
abdominal compartment syndrome, a diagnosis faciliated by measure-
ment  of  bladder  pressure.  Signs  and/or  symptoms  of  limb  ischemia 
may be clues to the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis.

 ■ URINE FINDINGS
Complete anuria early in the course of AKI is uncommon except in the 
following  situations:  complete  urinary  tract  obstruction,  renal  artery 
occlusion, overwhelming septic shock, severe ischemia (often with cor-
tical necrosis), or severe proliferative glomerulonephritis or vasculitis. 
A reduction in urine output (oliguria, defined as <400 mL/24 h) usually 
denotes more severe AKI (i.e., lower GFR) than when urine output is 
preserved. Oliguria is associated with worse clinical outcomes in AKI. 
Preserved urine output can be seen in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
characteristic  of  long-standing  urinary  tract  obstruction,  tubuloint-
erstitial disease, or nephrotoxicity from cisplatin or aminoglycosides, 
among other causes. Red or brown urine may be seen with or without 
gross hematuria; if the color persists in the supernatant after centrifu-
gation, then pigment nephropathy from rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis 
should be suspected.

The urinalysis and urine sediment examination are invaluable tools, 
but they require clinical correlation because of generally limited sen-
sitivity and specificity (see Fig. 310-6 and Chap. A4). In the absence 
of preexisting proteinuria from CKD, AKI from ischemia or nephro-
toxins leads to mild proteinuria (<1 g/d). Greater proteinuria in AKI 
suggests damage to the glomerular ultrafiltration barrier or excretion 
of myeloma light chains; the latter are not detected with conventional 
urine  dipsticks  (which  detect  albumin)  and  require  the  sulfosalicylic 
acid test or immunoelectrophoresis. Atheroemboli can cause a variable 
degree of proteinuria. Heavy proteinuria (“nephrotic range,” >3.5 g/d)

FIGURE  310-6  Interpretation  of  urinary  sediment  findings  in  acute  kidney  injury  (AKI).  ATN,  acute  tubular  necrosis;  GN,  glomerulonephritis;  HUS,  hemolytic-uremic 
syndrome; RBCs, red blood cells; RTE, renal tubular epithelial; TTP, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; WBCs, white blood cells. (Adapted from L Yang, JV Bonventre:

can  occasionally  be  seen  in  glomerulonephritis,  vasculitis,  or  toxins/
medications that can affect the glomerulus as well as the tubulointersti-
tium (e.g., NSAIDs). AKI can also complicate cases of minimal change 
disease, a cause of the nephrotic syndrome often associated with low 
serum albumin concentrations (Chap. 309). If the dipstick is positive 
for hemoglobin but few red blood cells are evident in the urine sedi-
ment, then rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis should be suspected.

Prerenal azotemia may present with hyaline casts or an unremark-
able  urine  sediment  examination.  Postrenal  AKI  may  also  be  associ-
ated with an unremarkable sediment, but hematuria and pyuria may 
be  seen  depending  on  the  cause  of  obstruction.  AKI  from  ATN  due 
to  ischemic  injury,  sepsis,  or  certain  nephrotoxins  has  characteristic 
urine sediment findings: pigmented “muddy brown” granular casts and 
tubular epithelial cell casts. These findings may be absent in more than 
20%  of  cases,  however.  Glomerulonephritis  may  lead  to  dysmorphic 
red blood cells or red blood cell casts. Interstitial nephritis may lead to 
white blood cell casts. The urine sediment findings overlap somewhat 
in glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis, and a diagnosis is not 
always  possible  on  the  basis  of  the  urine  sediment  alone.  Urine  eos-
inophils have a limited role in differential diagnosis; they can be seen 
in interstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis, cystitis, atheroembolic disease, 
or  glomerulonephritis.  Crystalluria  may  be  important  diagnostically. 
The  finding  of  oxalate  crystals  in  AKI  should  prompt  an  evaluation 
for ethylene glycol toxicity. Abundant uric acid crystals may be seen in 
tumor lysis syndrome.
 ■ BLOOD LABORATORY FINDINGS
Certain forms of AKI are associated with characteristic patterns in the 
rise and fall of SCr. Prerenal azotemia typically leads to modest rises 
in  SCr  that  return  to  baseline  with  improvement  in  hemodynamic 
status.  Contrast  nephropathy  leads  to  a  rise  in  SCr  within  24–48  h, 
peak within 3–5 days, and resolution within 5–7 days. In comparison, 
atheroembolic  disease  usually  manifests  with  more  subacute  rises  in 
SCr, although severe AKI with rapid increases in SCr can occur in this 
setting. With many of the epithelial cell toxins such as aminoglycoside 
antibiotics and cisplatin, the rise in SCr is characteristically delayed for 
3–5 days to 2 weeks after initial exposure.

A  complete  blood  count  may  provide  diagnostic  clues.  Anemia  is 
common in AKI and is usually multifactorial in origin. It is not related 
to an effect of AKI solely on production of red blood cells because this 

effect in isolation takes longer to manifest. Myeloma can be diagnosed 
with serum immunoelectrophoresis or free light chain assay, and it can 
often  be  suspected  if  the  blood  anion  gap  is  low  due  to  unmeasured 
cationic  proteins.  Peripheral  eosinophilia  can  accompany  interstitial 
nephritis,  atheroembolic  disease,  polyarteritis  nodosa,  and  Churg-
Strauss vasculitis. Severe anemia in the absence of bleeding may reflect 
hemolysis,  multiple  myeloma,  or  thrombotic  microangiopathy  (e.g., 
hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS] or TTP). Other laboratory findings 
of  thrombotic  microangiopathy  include  thrombocytopenia,  schisto-
cytes on peripheral blood smear, elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, 
and low haptoglobin content. Evaluation of patients suspected of hav-
ing TTP or HUS includes measurement of levels of the von Willebrand 
factor  cleaving  protease  (ADAMTS13)  and  testing  for  Shiga  toxin–
producing Escherichia coli. “Atypical HUS” constitutes the majority of 
adult cases of HUS; genetic testing is important because it is estimated 
that 60–70% of atypical HUS patients have mutations in genes encod-
ing proteins that regulate the alternative complement pathway.

AKI often leads to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocal-
cemia. Marked hyperphosphatemia with accompanying hypocalcemia 
may suggest rhabdomyolysis or tumor lysis syndrome. Serum creatine 
kinase and uric acid levels are often elevated in rhabdomyolysis, while 
tumor  lysis  syndrome  can  be  associated  with  normal  or  marginally 
elevated  creatine  kinase  and  markedly  elevated  serum  uric  acid.  The 
anion  gap  may  be  increased  with  any  cause  of  uremia  due  to  reten-
tion  of  anions  such  as  phosphate,  hippurate,  sulfate,  and  urate.  The 
co-occurrence  of  an  increased  anion  gap  and  an  osmolal  gap  may 
suggest  ethylene  glycol  poisoning,  which  may  also  cause  oxalate 
crystalluria  and  oxalate  deposition  in  kidney  tissue.  Low  anion  gap 
may  provide  a  clue  to  the  diagnosis  of  multiple  myeloma  due  to  the 
presence  of  unmeasured  cationic  proteins.  Laboratory  blood  tests 
helpful for the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis include 
depressed complement levels and high titers of antinuclear antibodies 
(ANAs), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), antiglomer-
ular  basement  membrane  (anti-GBM)  antibodies,  and  cryoglobulins. 
Anti-phospholiase A2 receptor antibodies will point to a diagnosis of 
membranous nephropathy.
 ■ RENAL FAILURE INDICES
Several indices have been used to help differentiate prerenal azotemia 
from  intrinsic  AKI  when  the  tubules  are  malfunctioning.  The  low

tubular flow rate and increased renal medullary recycling of urea seen 
in  prerenal  azotemia  may  cause  a  disproportionate  elevation  of  the 
BUN compared to creatinine. Other causes of disproportionate BUN 
elevation need to be kept in mind, however, including upper gastroin-
testinal bleeding, hyperalimentation, increased tissue catabolism, and 
glucocorticoid use.

The  FeNa  is  the  fraction  of  the  filtered  sodium  load  that  is  not 
reabsorbed by the tubules, and is a measure of both the kidney’s ability 
to reabsorb sodium as well as endogenously and exogenously admin-
istered factors that affect tubular reabsorption. As such, it depends on 
sodium  intake,  effective  intravascular  volume,  GFR,  diuretic  intake, 
and intact tubular reabsorptive mechanisms. With prerenal azotemia, 
the FeNa may be <1%, suggesting avid tubular sodium reabsorption. 
In patients with CKD, a FeNa significantly >1% can be present despite 
a  superimposed  prerenal  state.  The  FeNa  may  also  be  >1%  despite 
hypovolemia due to treatment with diuretics. Low FeNa is often seen 
early  in  glomerulonephritis  and  other  disorders  and,  hence,  should 
not be taken as prima facie evidence of prerenal azotemia. Low FeNa 
is therefore suggestive of, but not synonymous with, effective intravas-
cular volume depletion, and should not be used as the sole guide for 
volume  management.  The  response  of  urine  output  to  crystalloid  or 
colloid fluid administration may be both diagnostic and therapeutic in 
prerenal azotemia. In ischemic AKI, the FeNa is frequently >1% because 
of  tubular  injury  and  resultant  impaired  ability  to  reabsorb  sodium. 
Several causes of ischemia-associated and nephrotoxin-associated AKI 
can present with FeNa <1%, however, including sepsis (often early in 
the course), rhabdomyolysis, and contrast nephropathy.

The  ability  of  the  kidney  to  produce  a  concentrated  urine  is 
dependent  upon  many  factors  and  relies  on  good  tubular  function 
in  multiple  regions  of  the  kidney.  In  the  patient  not  taking  diuretics 
and  with  good  baseline  kidney  function,  urine  osmolality  may  be  
>500 mOsm/kg in prerenal azotemia, consistent with an intact med-
ullary  concentration  gradient  and  elevated  serum  vasopressin  levels 
causing  water  reabsorption  by  passive  diffusion  from  the  collecting 
duct into a concentrated medullary interstitium, resulting in concen-
trated urine. In elderly patients and those with CKD, however, baseline 
concentrating defects may exist, making urinary osmolality unreliable 
in  many  instances.  Loss  of  concentrating  ability  is  common  in  most 
forms of AKI that affect the tubules and interstitium, resulting in urine 
osmolality <350 mOsm/kg, but this finding is not specific.

 ■ RADIOLOGIC EVALUATION
Postrenal AKI should always be considered in the differential diagno-
sis of AKI because treatment is usually successful if instituted early. 
Simple  bladder  catheterization  can  rule  out  urethral  obstruction. 
Imaging of the urinary tract with renal ultrasound or CT scan should 
be  undertaken  to  investigate  obstruction  in  individuals  with  AKI 
unless  an  alternate  diagnosis  is  apparent.  Findings  of  obstruction 
include dilation of the collecting system and hydroureteronephrosis. 
Obstruction can be present without radiologic abnormalities in the 
setting  of  volume  depletion,  retroperitoneal  fibrosis,  encasement 
with  tumor,  and  also  early  in  the  course  of  obstruction.  If  a  high 
clinical  index  of  suspicion  for  obstruction  persists  despite  normal 
imaging, antegrade or retrograde pyelography should be performed. 
Imaging may also provide additional helpful information about kid-
ney size and echogenicity to assist in the distinction between acute 
versus CKD. In CKD, kidneys are usually smaller unless the patient 
has  diabetic  nephropathy,  HIV-associated  nephropathy,  or  infiltra-
tive  diseases.  Normal-sized  kidneys  are  expected  in  AKI.  Enlarged 
kidneys in a patient with AKI suggest the possibility of acute inter-
stitial  nephritis  or  infiltrative  diseases.  As  described  previously, 
vascular imaging may be useful if venous or arterial obstruction is 
suspected, but the risks of contrast administration should be kept in 
mind. MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) should 
be avoided if possible in severe AKI due to the possibility of induc-
ing  nephrogenic  system  fibrosis,  a  rare  but  serious  complication 
seen most commonly in patients with end-stage renal disease. The 
recommendations  regarding  use  of  GBCAs  in  subjects  with  CKD 
remain controversial.

 ■ KIDNEY BIOPSY
If  the  cause  of  AKI  is  not  apparent  based  on  the  clinical  context, 
physical  examination,  laboratory  studies,  and  radiologic  evaluation, 
kidney  biopsy  should  be  considered.  The  kidney  biopsy  can  provide 
definitive  diagnostic  and  prognostic  information  about  acute  kidney 
disease  and  CKD.  The  procedure  is  most  often  used  in  AKI  when 
prerenal  azotemia,  postrenal  AKI,  and  ischemic  or  nephrotoxic  AKI 
have  been  deemed  unlikely,  and  other  possible  diagnoses  are  being 
considered such as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, interstitial nephritis, 
myeloma  kidney,  HUS  and  TTP,  and  allograft  dysfunction.  Kidney 
biopsy is associated with a risk of bleeding, which can be severe and 
organ- or life-threatening in patients with thrombocytopenia or coag-
ulopathy, but the diagnostic and prognostic information obtained can 
be invaluable.
 ■ NOVEL BIOMARKERS
BUN  and  creatinine  are  functional  biomarkers  of  glomerular  fil-
tration  rather  than  tissue  injury  biomarkers  and,  therefore,  may  be 
suboptimal  for  the  diagnosis  of  actual  parenchymal  kidney  damage. 
BUN and creatinine are also relatively slow to rise after kidney injury. 
Several urine and blood biomarkers have been investigated and show 
promise  for  earlier  and  accurate  diagnosis  of  AKI  and  for  predict-
ing AKI prognosis. In cases of oliguric AKI, the urinary flow rate in 
response to bolus intravenous furosemide 1.0–1.5 mg/kg can be used 
a  prognostic  test:  urine  output  <200  mL  over  2  h  after  intravenous 
furosemide may identify patients at higher risk of progression to more 
severe AKI, and the need for renal replacement therapy. The severity 
or  risk  of  progressive  AKI  may  also  be  reflected  in  findings  on  urine 
microscopy.  In  one  study  involving  review  of  fresh  urine  sediments  by 
board-certified nephrologists, a greater number of renal tubular epithelial 
cells and/or granular casts in the urine sediment was associated with both 
the severity and worsening of AKI. Protein biomarkers of kidney injury 
have also been identified in animal models of AKI and have been used 
in humans and found to be particularly useful in toxicity identification. 
Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) is a type 1 transmembrane protein that 
is abundantly expressed in proximal tubular cells injured by ischemia or 
multiple, distinct nephrotoxins, such as cisplatin. KIM-1 is not expressed 
in appreciable quantities in the absence of tubular injury or in extrarenal 
tissues.  KIM-1  can  be  detected  after  ischemic  or  nephrotoxic  injury  in 
the urine and plasma. Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL, 
also known as lipocalin-2 or siderocalin) is another biomarker of AKI. 
NGAL was first discovered as a protein in granules of human neutrophils. 
NGAL  can  bind  to  iron  siderophore  complexes  and  may  have  tissue- 
protective  effects  in  the  proximal  tubule.  NGAL  is  highly  upregulated 
after inflammation and kidney injury and can be detected in the plasma 
and urine within 2 h of cardiopulmonary bypass–associated AKI. Soluble 
urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a signaling glyco-
protein expressed in multiple cell types and thought to be involved in 
the pathogenesis of certain kidney diseases; suPAR has been measured 
in the plasma and found to predict the subsequent development of AKI. 
In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the 
marketing  of  a  test  based  on  the  combination  of  the  urinary  concen-
trations  of  two  cell-cycle  arrest  biomarkers,  insulin-like  growth  factor 
binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 
(TIMP-2) as predictive biomarkers for higher risk of the development 
of moderate to severe AKI in critically ill patients. In 2018 the FDA also 
qualified a panel of urinary markers including KIM-1, NGAL, N-acetyl- 
beta-D-glucosaminidase, osteopontin, cystatin-C, and clusterin for the 
detection of kidney tubular injury in phase 1 trials in healthy volun-
teers. The optimal use of AKI biomarkers in clinical settings is an area 
of ongoing investigation.

COMPLICATIONS OF AKI
The kidney plays a central role in homeostatic control of volume status, 
blood pressure, plasma electrolyte composition, and acid-base balance, 
and for excretion of nitrogenous and other waste products. Complica-
tions associated with AKI are, therefore, protean, and depend on the 
severity of AKI and other associated conditions. Mild to moderate AKI 
may be entirely asymptomatic, particularly early in the course.

 ■ UREMIA
Buildup  of  nitrogenous  waste  products,  manifested  as  an  elevated 
BUN concentration, is a hallmark of AKI. BUN itself poses little direct 
toxicity at levels <100 mg/dL. At higher concentrations, mental status 
changes and bleeding complications can arise. Other toxins normally 
cleared  by  the  kidney  may  be  responsible  for  the  symptom  complex 
known as uremia. Few of the many possible uremic toxins have been 
definitively identified. The correlation of BUN and SCr concentrations 
with uremic symptoms is extremely variable, due in part to differences 
in urea and creatinine generation rates across individuals.

 ■ HYPERVOLEMIA AND HYPOVOLEMIA
Expansion  of  extracellular  fluid  volume  is  a  major  complication  of 
oliguric and anuric AKI, due to impaired salt and water excretion. The 
result can be weight gain, dependent edema, increased jugular venous 
pressure, and pulmonary edema; the latter can be life threatening. Pul-
monary edema can also occur from volume overload and hemorrhage 
in  pulmonary  renal  syndromes.  AKI  may  also  induce  or  exacerbate 
acute lung injury characterized by increased vascular permeability and 
inflammatory cell infiltration in lung parenchyma. Recovery from AKI 
is often heralded by an increase in urine output. This “polyuric” phase 
of recovery may be due to an osmotic diuresis from retained urea and 
other waste products as well as delayed recovery of tubular reabsorptive 
functions.

 ■ HYPONATREMIA
Abnormalities  in  plasma  electrolyte  composition  can  be  mild  or  life 
threatening.  The  dysfunctional  kidney  has  limited  ability  to  regulate 
electrolyte  balance.  Administration  of  excessive  hypotonic  crystal-
loid  or  isotonic  dextrose  solutions  can  result  in  hypoosmolality  and 
hyponatremia,  which,  if  severe,  can  cause  neurologic  abnormalities, 
including seizures.

 ■ HYPERKALEMIA
An  important  complication  of  AKI  is  hyperkalemia.  Marked  hyper-
kalemia  is  particularly  common  in  rhabdomyolysis,  hemolysis,  and 
tumor  lysis  syndrome  due  to  release  of  intracellular  potassium  from 
damaged cells. Muscle weakness may be a symptom of hyperkalemia. 
Potassium affects the cellular membrane potential of cardiac and neu-
romuscular  tissues.  The  more  serious  complication  of  hyperkalemia 
is  due  to  effects  on  cardiac  conduction,  leading  to  potentially  fatal 
arrhythmias.

 ■ ACIDOSIS
Metabolic acidosis, usually accompanied by an elevation in the anion 
gap,  is  common  in  AKI,  and  can  further  complicate  acid-base  and 
potassium balance in individuals with other causes of acidosis, includ-
ing sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis, or respiratory acidosis.

 ■ HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA AND HYPOCALCEMIA
AKI  can  lead  to  hyperphosphatemia,  particularly  in  highly  catabolic 
patients  or  those  with  AKI  from  rhabdomyolysis,  hemolysis,  and 
tumor lysis syndrome. Metastatic deposition of calcium phosphate can 
lead  to  hypocalcemia.  AKI-associated  hypocalcemia  may  also  arise 
from derangements in the vitamin D–parathyroid hormone–fibroblast 
growth  factor-23  axis.  Hypocalcemia  is  often  asymptomatic  but  can 
lead  to  perioral  paresthesias,  muscle  cramps,  seizures,  carpopedal 
spasms, and prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiography. 
Calcium levels should be corrected for the degree of hypoalbuminemia, 
if present, or ionized calcium levels should be followed. Mild, asymp-
tomatic hypocalcemia does not require treatment.

 ■ BLEEDING
Hematologic complications of AKI include anemia and bleeding, both 
of which are exacerbated by coexisting disease processes such as sep-
sis,  liver  disease,  and  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation.  Direct 
hematologic  effects  from  AKI-related  uremia  include  decreased  ery-
thropoiesis and platelet dysfunction.

 ■ INFECTIONS
Infections are a common precipitant of AKI and also a dreaded com-
plication of AKI. Impaired host immunity has been described in ESKD 
and may be operative in severe AKI.

 ■ CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS
The major cardiac complications of AKI are arrhythmias, pericarditis, 
and  pericardial  effusion.  In  addition,  volume  overload  and  uremia 
may  lead  to  cardiac  injury  and  impaired  cardiac  function.  In  animal 
studies cellular apoptosis and capillary vascular congestion as well as 
mitochondrial dysfunction have been described in the heart after renal 
ischemia reperfusion.

 ■ MALNUTRITION
AKI is often a severely hypercatabolic state, and therefore malnutrition 
is a major complication.

 ■ PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF AKI
The management of individuals with and at risk for AKI varies accord-
ing to the underlying cause (Table 310-3). Common to all are several 
principles.  Optimization  of  hemodynamics,  correction  of  fluid  and 
electrolyte  imbalances,  discontinuation  of  nephrotoxic  medications, 
and  dose  adjustment  of  administered  medications  are  all  critical. 
Common causes of AKI such as sepsis and ischemic ATN do not yet 
have specific therapies once injury is established, but meticulous clin-
ical attention is needed to support the patient until (if) AKI resolves. 
The  kidney  possesses  remarkable  capacity  to  repair  itself  after  even 
severe, dialysis-requiring AKI, when baseline renal function was intact. 
However,  many  patients  with  AKI,  particularly  when  superimposed 
on  preexisting  CKD,  undergo  maladaptive  repair  processes  and  do 
not  recover  fully  and  may  remain  dialysis  dependent.  It  has  become 
increasingly apparent that AKI predisposes to accelerated progression 
of CKD, and CKD is an important risk factor for AKI.

Prerenal Azotemia  Prevention and treatment of prerenal azotemia 
require optimization of renal perfusion. The composition of replace-
ment  fluids  should  be  targeted  to  the  type  of  fluid  lost.  Severe  acute 
blood  loss  should  be  treated  with  packed  red  blood  cells.  In  AKI, 
oliguria  alone  is  not  an  indication  for  fluid  administration.  Intravas-
cular hypovolemia should be the only indication. Optimal fluid com-
position  is  not  well  defined.  Crystalloid  solutions  are  less  expensive 
than  albumin-containing  solutions,  and  albumin  does  not  provide  a 
survival benefit compared to crystalloid. Albumin may decrease fluid 
requirements but does not reduce the need for renal replacement ther-
apy.  Buffered  crystalloid  solutions  (e.g.,  Ringer’s  Lactate,  Hartmann’s 
solution,  Plasma-Lyte)  are  recommended  for  patients  with  AKI  who 
are not hypochloremic; 0.9% saline is recommended for hypovolemic 
hypochloremic patients if the serum chloride concentration is closely 
monitored.  Excessive  chloride  administration  from  0.9%  saline  may 
lead  to  hyperchloremic  metabolic  acidosis  and  may  impair  GFR. 
Hydroxyethyl starch solutions increase the risk of severe AKI and are 
contraindicated. Bicarbonate-containing solutions (e.g., dextrose water 
with 150 mEq sodium bicarbonate) can be used if metabolic acidosis 
is a concern.

Optimization  of  cardiac  function  in  AKI  may  require  use  of  ino-
tropic agents, preload- and afterload-reducing agents, antiarrhythmic 
drugs, and mechanical aids such as ventricular assist devices. Invasive 
hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy may be necessary.

Cirrhosis  and  Hepatorenal  Syndrome  Fluid  management  in 
individuals  with  cirrhosis,  ascites,  and  AKI  is  challenging  because  of 
the  frequent  difficulty  in  ascertaining  intravascular  volume  status. 
Administration  of  intravenous  fluids  as  a  volume  challenge  may  be 
required  diagnostically  as  well  as  therapeutically.  Excessive  volume 
administration may, however, result in worsening ascites and pulmo-
nary compromise in the setting of hepatorenal syndrome or AKI due 
to superimposed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Peritonitis should 
be ruled out by culture of ascitic fluid. Albumin may prevent AKI in 
those treated with antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The 
definitive  treatment  of  the  hepatorenal  syndrome  is  orthotopic  liver

Intrinsic  AKI  Several  agents  have  been  tested  and  have  failed  to 
show  benefit  in  the  treatment  of  acute  tubular  injury.  These  include 
atrial natriuretic peptide, low-dose dopamine, endothelin antagonists, 
erythropoietin, loop diuretics, calcium channel blockers, α-adrenergic 
receptor  blockers,  prostaglandin  analogs,  antioxidants,  antibodies 
against leukocyte adhesion molecules, and insulin-like growth factor, 
among  many  others.  Most  studies  have  enrolled  patients  with  severe 
and well-established AKI, and treatment may have been initiated too 
late.  Kidney  injury  biomarkers  described  previously  may  provide  an 
opportunity to test agents earlier in the course of AKI.

AKI due to acute glomerulonephritis or vasculitis may respond to 
immunosuppressive agents and/or plasmapheresis (Chap. 309). Aller-
gic  interstitial  nephritis  due  to  medications  requires  discontinuation 
of the offending agent. Glucocorticoids have been used but not tested 
in randomized trials, in cases where AKI persists or worsens despite 
discontinuation of the suspected medication. AKI due to scleroderma 
(scleroderma renal crisis) should be treated with ACE inhibitors. Idio-
pathic  TTP  is  a  medical  emergency  and  should  be  treated  promptly 
with plasma exchange. Pharmacologic blockade of complement activa-
tion may be effective in atypical HUS.

Early  and  aggressive  volume  repletion  is  mandatory  in  patients 
with rhabdomyolysis, who may initially require 10 L of fluid per day. 
Alkaline fluids (e.g., 75 mmol/L sodium bicarbonate added to 0.45% 
saline)  may  be  beneficial  in  preventing  tubular  injury  and  cast  for-
mation, but carry the risk of worsening hypocalcemia. Diuretics may 
be  used  if  fluid  repletion  is  adequate  but  unsuccessful  in  achieving 
urinary flow rates of 200–300 mL/h. There is no specific therapy for 
established AKI in rhabdomyolysis, other than dialysis in severe cases 
or  general  supportive  care  to  maintain  fluid  and  electrolyte  balance 
and tissue perfusion. Careful attention must be focused on calcium and 
phosphate status because of precipitation in damaged tissue and release 
when the tissue heals.

Postrenal  AKI  Prompt  recognition  and  relief  of  urinary  tract 
obstruction  can  forestall  the  development  of  permanent  structural 
damage  induced  by  urinary  stasis.  The  site  of  obstruction  defines 
the  treatment  approach.  Transurethral  or  suprapubic  bladder  cathe-
terization may be all that is needed initially for urethral strictures or 
functional  bladder  impairment.  Ureteric  obstruction  may  be  treated 
by percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement or ureteral stent place-
ment. Relief of obstruction is usually followed by an appropriate diure-
sis for several days. In rare cases, severe polyuria persists due to tubular 
dysfunction and may require continued administration of intravenous 
fluids and electrolytes for a period of time.

 ■ SUPPORTIVE MEASURES FOR AKI
Volume  Management  Hypervolemia  in  oliguric  or  anuric  AKI 
may  be  life  threatening  due  to  acute  pulmonary  edema,  especially 
because  many  patients  have  coexisting  pulmonary  disease,  and  AKI 
likely  increases  pulmonary  vascular  permeability.  Fluid  and  sodium 
should  be  restricted,  and  diuretics  may  be  used  to  increase  the  uri-
nary  flow  rate.  There  is  no  evidence  that  increasing  urine  output 
itself  improves  the  natural  history  of  AKI,  but  diuretics  may  help  to 
avoid  the  need  for  dialysis  in  some  cases.  In  severe  cases  of  volume 
overload,  furosemide  may  be  given  as  a  bolus  (200  mg)  followed  by 
an intravenous drip (10–40 mg/h), with or without a thiazide diuretic. 
In  decompensated  heart  failure,  stepped  diuretic  therapy  was  found 
to be superior to ultrafiltration in preserving renal function. Diuretic 
therapy  should  be  stopped  if  there  is  no  response.  Dopamine  in  low 
doses may transiently increase salt and water excretion by the kidney 
in prerenal states, but clinical trials have failed to show any benefit in 
patients  with  intrinsic  AKI.  Because  of  the  risk  of  arrhythmias  and 
potential bowel ischemia, the risks of dopamine outweigh the benefits 
if used specifically for the treatment or prevention of AKI.

Electrolyte  and  Acid-Base  Abnormalities  The  treatment  of 
dysnatremias  and  hyperkalemia  is  described  in  Chap.  53.  Meta-
bolic  acidosis  is  generally  not  treated  unless  severe  (pH  <7.20  and 
serum  bicarbonate  <15  mmol/L).  Acidosis  can  be  treated  with  oral

2308 or  intravenous  sodium  bicarbonate  (Chap.  55),  but  overcorrection 
should  be  avoided  because  of  the  possibility  of  metabolic  alkalosis, 
hypocalcemia,  hypokalemia,  and  volume  overload.  Hyperphosphate-
mia is common in AKI and can usually be treated by limiting intestinal 
absorption of phosphate using phosphate binders (calcium carbonate, 
calcium  acetate,  lanthanum,  sevelamer,  or  aluminum  hydroxide). 
Symptomatic hypocalcemia should be treated with calcium gluconate 
or calcium chloride. Ionized calcium should be monitored rather than 
total calcium when hypoalbuminemia is present.

Malnutrition 
Increased catabolism with protein energy wasting is 
common in severe AKI, particularly in the setting of multisystem organ 
failure.  Inadequate  nutrition  may  lead  to  starvation  ketoacidosis  and 
protein  catabolism.  Excessive  nutrition  may  increase  the  generation 
of  nitrogenous  waste  and  lead  to  worsening  azotemia.  Total  parent-
eral nutrition requires large volumes of fluid administration and may 
complicate efforts at volume control. According to the Kidney Disease 
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, patients with AKI 
should achieve a total energy intake of 20–30 kcal/kg per day. Protein 
intake should vary depending on the severity of AKI: 0.8–1.0 g/kg per 
day in noncatabolic AKI without the need for dialysis; 1.0–1.5 g/kg per 
day in patients on dialysis; and up to a maximum of 1.7 g/kg per day 
if hypercatabolic and receiving continuous renal replacement therapy. 
Trace  elements  and  water-soluble  vitamins  should  also  be  supple-
mented  in  AKI  patients  treated  with  dialysis  and  continuous  renal 
replacement therapy.

Anemia  The anemia seen in AKI is usually multifactorial and is not 
improved  by  erythropoiesis-stimulating  agents,  due  to  their  delayed 
onset  of  action  and  the  presence  of  bone  marrow  resistance  in  crit-
ically  ill  patients.  Uremic  bleeding  may  respond  to  desmopressin  or 
estrogens, but may require dialysis for treatment in the case of long-
standing  or  severe  uremia.  Gastrointestinal  prophylaxis  with  proton 
pump inhibitors or histamine (H2) receptor blockers is required. It is 
important  to  recognize,  however,  that  proton  pump  inhibitors  have 
been associated with AKI from interstitial nephritis, a relationship that 
is  increasingly  being  recognized.  Venous  thromboembolism  prophy-
laxis  is  important  and  should  be  tailored  to  the  clinical  setting;  low- 
molecular-weight heparins and factor Xa inhibitors have unpredictable 
pharmacokinetics  in  severe  AKI  and  should  generally  be  avoided  if 
possible.

Dialysis  Indications  and  Modalities  (See  also  Chap.  312)  
Dialysis  is  indicated  when  medical  management  fails  to  control  vol-
ume overload, hyperkalemia, or acidosis; in some toxic ingestions; and 
when  there  are  severe  complications  of  uremia  (asterixis,  pericardial 
rub  or  effusion,  encephalopathy,  uremic  bleeding).  Late  initiation  of 
dialysis carries the risk of avoidable volume, electrolyte, and metabolic 
complications of AKI. On the other hand, initiating dialysis too early 
may unnecessarily expose individuals to intravenous lines and invasive 
procedures, with the attendant risks of infection, bleeding, procedural 
complications,  and  hypotension.  In  randomized  controlled  trials, 
earlier  versus  later  initiation  of  dialysis  has  not  been  demonstrated 
to improve survival, and may increase the risk of adverse events. The 
initiation of dialysis should not, however, await the development of a 
life-threatening complication of renal failure. Many nephrologists initi-
ate dialysis for AKI empirically when the BUN exceeds a certain value 
(e.g., 100 mg/dL) in patients without clinical signs of recovery of kidney 
function.  The  available  modes  for  renal  replacement  therapy  in  AKI 
require  either  access  to  the  peritoneal  cavity  (for  peritoneal  dialysis) 
or the large blood vessels (for hemodialysis, hemofiltration, and other 
hybrid procedures). Small solutes are removed across a semipermeable 
membrane  down  their  concentration  gradient  (“diffusive”  clearance) 
and/or  along  with  the  movement  of  plasma  water  (“convective” 
clearance).  Hemodialysis  can  be  used  intermittently  or  continuously 
and  can  be  done  through  convective  clearance,  diffusive  clearance, 
or a combination of the two. Vascular access is through the femoral, 
internal  jugular,  or  subclavian  veins.  Hemodialysis  is  an  intermittent 
procedure that removes solutes through diffusive and convective clear-
ance. Hemodialysis is typically performed 3–4 h per day, three to four 

times per week, and is the most common form of renal replacement 
therapy  for  AKI.  One  of  the  major  complications  of  hemodialysis  is 
hypotension, particularly in the critically ill, which can perpetuate AKI 
by causing ischemic injury to the recovering organ.

Continuous  intravascular  procedures  were  developed  in  the  early 
1980s  to  treat  hemodynamically  unstable  patients  without  inducing 
the  rapid  shifts  of  volume,  osmolarity,  and  electrolytes  characteristic 
of  intermittent  hemodialysis.  Continuous  renal  replacement  therapy 
(CRRT)  can  be  performed  by  convective  clearance  (continuous  ven-
ovenous  hemofiltration  [CVVH]),  in  which  large  volumes  of  plasma 
water (and accompanying solutes) are forced across the semipermeable 
membrane by means of hydrostatic pressure; the plasma water is then 
replaced by a physiologic crystalloid solution. CRRT can also be per-
formed  by  diffusive  clearance  (continuous  venovenous  hemodialysis 
[CVVHD]), a technology similar to hemodialysis except at lower blood 
flow and dialysate flow rates. A hybrid therapy combines both diffusive 
and  convective  clearance  (continuous  venovenous  hemodiafiltration 
[CVVHDF]). To achieve some of the advantages of CRRT without the 
need  for  24-h  staffing  of  the  procedure,  some  physicians  favor  slow 
low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) or extended daily dialysis (EDD). In this 
therapy, blood flow and dialysate flow are higher than in CVVHD, but 
the treatment time is reduced to ≤12 h. The choice of modality is often 
dictated by the immediate availability of technology and the expertise 
of medical staff.

The  optimal  dose  of  dialysis  for  AKI  for  any  particular  patient  is 
not  clear.  Daily  intermittent  hemodialysis  and  high-dose  CRRT  do 
not  confer  a  demonstrable  survival  or  renal  recovery  advantage,  but 
care  should  be  taken  to  avoid  undertreatment.  Studies  have  failed  to 
show that continuous therapies are superior to intermittent therapies 
when  measuring  survival  rates.  If  available,  CRRT  is  often  preferred 
in  patients  with  severe  hemodynamic  instability,  cerebral  edema,  or 
significant volume overload.

Peritoneal dialysis can be performed through a temporary intrap-
eritoneal  catheter.  It  is  rarely  used  in  the  United  States  for  AKI  in 
adults  (although  it  was  “rediscovered”  during  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic owing to inadequate numbers of continuous and intermittent 
hemodialysis  machines).  Peritoneal  dialysis  has  enjoyed  widespread 
use internationally, particularly when hemodialysis technology is not 
as  readily  available.  Dialysate  solution  is  instilled  into  and  removed 
from  the  peritoneal  cavity  at  regular  intervals  in  order  to  achieve 
diffusive  and  convective  clearance  of  solutes  across  the  peritoneal 
membrane; ultrafiltration of water is achieved by the presence of an 
osmotic  gradient  across  the  peritoneal  membrane  achieved  by  high 
concentrations  of  dextrose  in  the  dialysate  solution.  Because  of  its 
continuous  nature,  it  is  often  better  tolerated  than  intermittent  pro-
cedures like hemodialysis in hypotensive patients. Peritoneal dialysis 
may not be sufficient for hypercatabolic patients due to inherent lim-
itations in dialysis efficacy.

OUTCOME AND PROGNOSIS
The  development  of  AKI  is  associated  with  a  significantly  increased 
risk of in-hospital and long-term mortality, longer length of stay, and 
increased costs. AKI is also associated with an increased risk of later 
cardiovascular  disease  events,  though  the  mechanisms  are  not  well 
understood. Prerenal azotemia, with the exception of the cardiorenal 
and  hepatorenal  syndromes,  and  postrenal  azotemia  carry  a  better 
prognosis than most cases of intrinsic AKI. The kidneys may recover 
even  after  severe,  dialysis-requiring  AKI.  Survivors  of  an  episode  of 
AKI requiring temporary dialysis, however, are at extremely high risk 
for  progressive  CKD,  and  up  to  10%  may  develop  ESKD  requiring 
dialysis  or  transplantation.  AKI  and  CKD  are  increasingly  seen  as 
interrelated syndromes: CKD is a major risk factor for the development 
of AKI, and AKI is a risk factor for the future development of CKD. 
Measurement  of  albuminuria  after  an  AKI  episode  can  help  predict 
the risk of kidney disease progression and can serve as a valuable risk- 
stratification tool. Postdischarge care after AKI under the supervision 
of a nephrologist for aggressive secondary prevention of kidney disease 
is prudent.

311 Chronic Kidney Disease

Joanne M. Bargman, Karl Skorecki

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) encompasses a spectrum of pathophys-
iologic processes associated with abnormal kidney function, often with 
a  progressive  decline  in  glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR).  The  risk  of 
worsening CKD is closely linked to both the GFR and the amount of 
albuminuria. Figure 311-1 provides a staging of CKD stratified by the 
estimates  for  further  progressive  decline  of  GFR  based  on  these  two 
parameters.

The  dispiriting  term  end-stage  renal  disease  represents  a  stage  of 
CKD where the accumulation of toxins, fluid, and electrolytes normally 
excreted  by  the  kidneys  leads  to  death  unless  the  toxins  are  removed 
by renal replacement therapy, using dialysis or kidney transplantation. 
These  interventions  are  discussed  in  Chaps.  312  and  313.  End-stage 
renal disease will be supplanted in this chapter by the term stage 5 CKD.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CKD
The pathophysiology of CKD involves two broad mechanisms of dam-
age:  (1)  specific  initiating  mechanisms  particular  to  the  underlying 

etiology (e.g., genetic abnormalities in kidney development, immune 
complex  deposition,  and  inflammation  in  certain  types  of  glomeru-
lonephritis, or toxin exposure in certain diseases of the renal tubules 
and  interstitium),  and  (2)  nonspecific  mechanisms  involving  hyper-
filtration  and  hypertrophy  of  the  remaining  viable  nephrons,  which 
are  common  consequences  of  long-term  reduction  of  renal  mass, 
irrespective  of  underlying  etiology.  The  responses  to  reduction  in 
nephron  number  are  mediated  by  vasoactive  hormones,  cytokines, 
and  growth  factors.  Eventually,  the  short-term  adaptations  of  hyper-
filtration  and  hypertrophy  to  maintain  GFR  become  maladaptive  as 
the  increased  pressure  and  flow  within  the  nephron  predisposes  to 
distortion  of  glomerular  architecture,  abnormal  podocyte  function, 
and disruption of the filtration barrier, leading to sclerosis and dropout 
of the remaining nephrons (Fig. 311-2). Increased intrarenal activity of 
the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) appears to contribute both to the 
initial compensatory hyperfiltration and to the subsequent maladaptive 
hypertrophy  and  sclerosis.  This  process  explains  why  a  reduction  in 
renal  mass  from  an  isolated  insult  may  lead  to  a  progressive  decline 
in renal function over many years and the efficacy of pharmacologic 
approaches that attenuate this response (Fig. 311-3).
 ■ IDENTIFICATION OF RISK FACTORS  
AND STAGING OF CKD
There has been significant recent progress in the identification of risk 
factors that increase the risk for CKD, even in individuals with normal 
GFR (Table 311-1).

Adults with such risk factors should be monitored at least every 2 
years for albuminuria, decline in eGFR, and blood pressure abnormali-
ties, so that a clinical management pathway can be planned.

Most recently identified risk factors for which there is now a consen-
sus include a past episode of apparently recovered acute kidney injury 
(AKI), tobacco use, and many forms of apparently resolved childhood 
and adolescent kidney disease. There is also an increasing awareness of 
the role of genetic risk factors, which account for 15–40% of adult-onset 
CKD,  with  the  percentage  often  depending  on  the  contribution  of 
demographic structure and history to the genetic variation for any pop-
ulation. Many rare inherited forms of CKD follow a Mendelian inher-
itance  pattern,  often  as  part  of  a  systemic  syndrome,  with  the  most

disease (ADPKD). In addition, it is now appreciated that many unique, 
kindred-specific,  site-specific  copy  number  variants  and  microdele-
tions, as well as functional variants at >60 genetic loci known to harbor 
systemic and kidney-only disease pathogenic mutations, also contrib-
ute  to  risk  for  pleiotropic  presentations  of  CKD  (Table 311-2).  Many 
of  the  genes  with  identified  CKD-causing  mutations  are  expressed  in 
the  podocytes  of  the  renal  glomeruli  or  in  the  glomerular  basement 

membrane, but others are expressed in tubule segments with a primary 
tubulointerstitial  process  and  secondary  glomerular  injury.  Given  the 
significant  contribution  of  monogenic  disease  etiologies,  consider-
ation is now given to chromosomal microarray and genome or exome 
sequencing for CKD of unknown cause in young adults, as noted below 
under Evaluation and Management of Patients with CKD.

In  addition,  recent  research  in  the  genetics  of  predisposition  to

number of genetic loci that are associated with common forms of CKD. 
A striking example is the finding of allelic versions of the APOL1 gene, 
of West African population ancestry, which contributes to the several-
fold  higher  frequency  of  certain  common  etiologies  of  nondiabetic 
CKD (e.g., focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) observed among Afri-
can  and  Hispanic  Americans,  in  major  regions  of  continental  Africa 
and the global African diaspora. The prevalence in West African pop-
ulations seems to have arisen as an evolutionary adaptation conferring 
protection from tropical pathogens. As in other common diseases with 
a heritable component, environmental triggers (e.g., a viral pathogen) 
transform genetic risk into disease.

To stage CKD, it is necessary to estimate the GFR rather than relying 
on serum creatinine concentration (Table 311-3). Many laboratories now 
report an estimated GFR, or eGFR, using one of these equations. These 
equations are valid only if the patient is in steady state, that is, the serum 
creatinine is neither rising nor falling over days. The societal implications 
of adjustment for a construct of race have been the subject of important 
recent discourse, with the idea that more individually sound adjustments 
without potentially negative racial categorizations be developed.

The  normal  annual  mean  decline  in  GFR  with  age  from  the  peak 
GFR (~120 mL/min per 1.73 m2) attained during the third decade of 
life is ~1 mL/min per year per 1.73 m2, reaching a mean value of 70 mL/

min per 1.73 m2 at age 70, with considerable interindividual variability. 
Although reduced GFR is expected with aging, the lower GFR signifies 
a  true  loss  of  kidney  function  with  attendant  consequences  in  terms 
of  risk  of  CKD  complications  and  requirement  for  dose  adjustment 
of  medications.  The  mean  GFR  is  lower  in  women  than  in  men.  For 
example,  a  woman  in  her  eighties  with  a  laboratory  report  of  serum 
creatinine in the normal range may have a GFR of <50 mL/min per 1.73 m2. 
Relatedly, even a mild elevation in serum creatinine concentration often 
signifies a substantial reduction in GFR in older individuals.

Measurement  of  albuminuria  is  also  helpful  for  monitoring 
nephron  injury  and  the  response  to  therapy  in  many  forms  of 
CKD,  especially  chronic  glomerular  diseases.  The  cumbersome 
24-h urine collection has been replaced by measurement of urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine  ratio  (UACR)  in  one  and  preferably  several 
spot  first-morning  urine  samples  as  a  measure  pointing  to  glom-
erular  injury.  Even  in  patients  with  negative  conventional  urinary 
dipstick tests for protein, persistent UACR >2.5 mg/mmol (male) or 
>3.5 mg/mmol (female) on two to three occasions serves as a marker 
not  only  for  early  detection  of  primary  kidney  disease  but  for  sys-
temic microvascular disease as well.

A Kidney Failure Risk (KFR) equation has been devised to predict 
the  risk  of  progression  to  stage  5  dialysis-dependent  kidney  disease. 
The  equation  is  available  on  many  sites  online  (for  example,  www 
.kidneyfailurerisk.com)  and  uses  age,  sex,  region  (North  American 
or  non–North  American),  GFR,  and  UACR.  It  has  been  validated  in 
several  cohorts  around  the  world,  although  the  risk  for  progression 
appears  to  be  greater  in  North  America,  accounting  for  the  regional 
adjustment in the equation.

Stages 1 and 2 CKD are usually asymptomatic, such that the recog-
nition  of  CKD  occurs  more  often  as  a  result  of  laboratory  testing  in 
clinical settings other than suspicion of kidney disease. Moreover, in 
the absence of the risk factors noted above, population-wide screen-
ing  is  not  recommended.  With  progression  to  CKD  stages  3  and  4, 
clinical  and  laboratory  complications  become  more  prominent. 
Virtually  all  organ  systems  are  affected,  but  the  most  evident  com-
plications  include  anemia  with  easy  fatigability;  decreased  appetite 
with progressive malnutrition; abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus, 
and  mineral-regulating  hormones,  such  as  1,25(OH)2D3  (calcitriol), 
parathyroid hormone (PTH), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-
23);  and  abnormalities  in  sodium,  potassium,  water,  and  acid-base 
homeostasis.  Many  patients,  especially  older  individuals,  will  have 
eGFR values compatible with stage 2 or 3 CKD. However, the major-
ity  of  these  patients  will  show  no  further  deterioration  of  kidney 
function.  In  this  setting,  it  is  advised  to  recheck  kidney  function, 
and  if  it  is  stable  and  not  associated  with  proteinuria,  the  patient 
can usually be followed with interval repeat testing without referral 
to a nephrologist. However, caution should be exercised in terms of 
potential  exposure  to  potential  nephrotoxins  or  interventions  that 
risk  AKI  and  also  with  respect  to  medication  dose  adjustment.  If 
repeat  testing  shows  declining  GFR,  albuminuria,  or  uncontrolled 
hypertension, referral to a nephrologist is appropriate. If the patient 
progresses  to  stage  5  CKD  (GFR  <15  mL/min),  toxins  accumulate 
such that patients usually experience a disturbance in their activities 
of daily living, well-being, nutritional status, and water and electro-
lyte homeostasis, eventuating in the uremic syndrome.
 ■ ETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
It  has  been  estimated  from  population  data  that  at  least  6%  of  the 
adult population in the United States has CKD at stages 1 and 2. An 
additional 4.5% of the U.S. population is estimated to have stages 3 
and  4  CKD.  Table  311-4  lists  the  five  most  frequent  categories  of 
causes  of  CKD,  cumulatively  accounting  for  >90%  of  the  CKD  dis-
ease  burden  worldwide.  The  relative  contribution  of  each  category 
varies among different geographic regions. The most frequent cause 
of CKD in North America and Europe is diabetic nephropathy, most 
often  secondary  to  type  2  diabetes  mellitus.  Patients  with  newly 
diagnosed  CKD  often  have  hypertension.  When  no  overt  evidence 
for a primary glomerular or tubulointerstitial kidney disease process 
is present, CKD is frequently attributed to hypertension. However, it 
is now appreciated that some of these patients may have a subclinical 
primary glomerulopathy, such as focal segmental or global glomeru-
losclerosis. In other patients, progressive nephrosclerosis and hyper-
tension are the renal correlates of a systemic vascular disease, often 
also involving large and small vessels elsewhere, such as the heart and 
brain. This latter combination is especially common in older patients, 
among  whom  chronic  kidney  ischemia  as  a  cause  of  CKD  may  be 
underdiagnosed.

Disease (CKD)a

aRelative contribution of each category varies with geographic region and race.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY  
OF UREMIA
Although serum urea and creatinine concentrations are used to mea-
sure the excretory capacity of the kidneys, accumulation of these two 
molecules  themselves  does  not  account  for  the  symptoms  and  signs 
that characterize the uremic syndrome in advanced CKD. Large num-
bers of toxins that accumulate when GFR declines have been implicated 
in  the  uremic  syndrome.  These  include  water-soluble,  hydrophobic, 
protein-bound,  charged,  and  uncharged  nitrogen-containing  nonvol-
atile  products  of  metabolism.  It  is  thus  evident  that  the  serum  con-
centrations  of  urea  and  creatinine  should  be  viewed  as  being  readily 
measured but very incomplete surrogate markers for retained toxins, 
and  monitoring  the  levels  of  urea  and  creatinine  in  the  patient  with 
impaired  kidney  function  represents  a  vast  oversimplification  of  the 
uremic state.

The  uremic  syndrome  involves  more  than  renal  excretory  failure. 
A host of metabolic and endocrine functions normally performed by 
the kidneys are also impaired and can result in anemia, malnutrition, 
and  abnormal  metabolism  of  carbohydrates,  fats,  and  proteins.  Fur-
thermore, plasma levels of many hormones, including PTH, FGF-23, 
insulin,  glucagon,  steroid  hormones  including  vitamin  D  and  sex 
hormones,  and  prolactin  change  with  CKD  as  a  result  of  reduced 
excretion,  decreased  degradation,  or  abnormal  regulation.  Finally, 
CKD  is  associated  with  increased  systemic  inflammation.  Elevated 
levels of C-reactive protein are detected along with other acute-phase 
reactants, whereas levels of so-called negative acute-phase reactants, such 
as albumin and fetuin, decline. Thus, the inflammation associated with 
CKD  is  important  in  the  malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis/
calcification syndrome, which contributes in turn to the acceleration of 
vascular disease and morbidity associated with advanced kidney disease.
In  summary,  the  pathophysiology  of  the  uremic  syndrome  can  be 
divided into manifestations in three spheres of dysfunction: (1) those 
consequent to the accumulation of toxins that normally undergo renal 
excretion; (2) those consequent to the loss of other kidney functions, 
such as fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and hormone regulation; and 
(3) progressive systemic inflammation and its vascular and nutritional 
consequences.

CLINICAL AND LABORATORY 
MANIFESTATIONS OF CKD AND UREMIA
Uremia leads to disturbances in the function of virtually every organ 
system. Chronic dialysis can reduce the incidence and severity of many 
of these disturbances, so that the florid manifestations of uremia have 
largely disappeared in the modern health care setting. However, even 
optimal  dialysis  therapy  is  not  completely  effective  as  renal  replace-
ment  therapy  because  some  disturbances  resulting  from  impaired 
kidney function fail to respond to dialysis.

 ■ FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND  
ACID-BASE DISORDERS
Sodium and Water Homeostasis  With normal kidney function, 
tubular excretion of filtered sodium and water matches intake. Many 
forms of kidney disease disrupt this balance such that dietary intake of 
sodium exceeds its excretion, leading to sodium retention and atten-
dant  extracellular  fluid  volume  (ECFV)  expansion.  This  expansion 
may  contribute  to  hypertension,  which  itself  can  accelerate  nephron 
hyperfiltration  and  injury.  As  long  as  water  intake  does  not  exceed 
the  capacity  for  renal  water  clearance,  the  ECFV  expansion  will  be 
isonatric  and  the  patient  will  have  a  normal  plasma  sodium  concen-
tration.  Hyponatremia  is  not  commonly  seen  in  CKD  patients  but, 
when  present,  often  responds  to  water  restriction.  The  patient  with 
ECFV  expansion  (peripheral  edema,  sometimes  hypertension  poorly 
responsive to therapy) should be counseled regarding salt restriction. 
Thiazide  diuretics  have  limited  utility  in  stages  3–5  CKD,  such  that 
administration  of  loop  diuretics,  including  furosemide,  bumetanide, 
or  torsemide,  may  be  needed.  Resistance  to  loop  diuretics  in  CKD 
often  mandates  use  of  higher  doses  than  those  used  in  patients  with 
higher GFR. The combination of loop diuretics with metolazone may

be helpful. Diuretic resistance with intractable edema and hypertension 
in advanced CKD may serve as an indication to initiate dialysis.

Rarely,  patients  with  CKD  may  have  impaired  renal  conservation 
of sodium and water. When an extrarenal cause for fluid loss, such as 
gastrointestinal  (GI)  loss,  is  present,  these  patients  may  be  prone  to 
ECFV depletion because of the inability of the failing kidney to reclaim 
filtered sodium adequately. Any depletion of ECFV, whether due to GI 
losses, renal sodium loss, or overzealous diuretic therapy, can further 
compromise kidney function through underperfusion, or a “prerenal” 
state, leading to acute-on-chronic kidney failure. In this setting, hold-
ing  or  adjusting  the  diuretic  dose  or  even  cautious  volume  repletion 
with normal saline may return the ECFV to normal and restore renal 
function to baseline.

Potassium  Homeostasis 
In  CKD,  the  decline  in  GFR  is  not 
necessarily  accompanied  by  a  parallel  decline  in  urinary  potassium 
excretion, which is predominantly mediated by aldosterone-dependent 
secretion  in  the  distal  nephron.  Another  defense  against  potassium 
retention  in  these  patients  is  augmented  potassium  excretion  in  the 
GI tract. Notwithstanding these two homeostatic responses, hyperka-
lemia may be precipitated in certain settings. These include increased 
dietary  potassium  intake,  hemolysis,  transfusion  of  stored  red  blood 
cells,  and  metabolic  acidosis.  Importantly,  a  host  of  medications  can 
inhibit renal potassium excretion and lead to hyperkalemia. The most 
important medications in this respect include the RAS inhibitors and 
spironolactone  and  other  potassium-sparing  diuretics  such  as  ami-
loride, eplerenone, and triamterene. The benefits of the RAS inhibitors 
in  ameliorating  hyperfiltration  and  progression  of  CKD  often  favor 
their cautious and judicious use with very close monitoring of plasma 
potassium  concentration.  Coadministration  of  potassium-lowering 
agents such as patiromer may allow for the use of RAS inhibitors with 
reduced risk of hyperkalemia.

Certain  causes  of  CKD  can  be  associated  with  earlier  and  more 
severe  disruption  of  potassium  secretory  mechanisms  in  the  distal 
nephron, out of proportion to the decline in GFR. These include con-
ditions  associated  with  hyporeninemic  hypoaldosteronism,  such  as 
diabetes, and renal diseases that preferentially affect the distal nephron, 
such as obstructive uropathy and sickle cell nephropathy.

Hypokalemia is not common in CKD and usually reflects markedly 
reduced dietary potassium intake, especially in association with exces-
sive  diuretic  therapy  or  concurrent  GI  losses.  The  use  of  potassium 
supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics may be risky in patients 
with impaired renal function and needs to be monitored closely.

Metabolic Acidosis  Metabolic acidosis is a common disturbance 
in CKD. The majority of patients can still acidify the urine, but they 
produce  less  ammonia  and,  therefore,  cannot  excrete  the  quantity 
of  protons  required  to  maintain  acid-base  balance  in  most  diets. 
Hyperkalemia, if present, further depresses ammonia production. The 
combination of hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis 
is often present, even at earlier stages of CKD, in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy or in those with predominant tubulointerstitial disease or 
obstructive uropathy. With further declining GFR, the total urinary net 
daily acid excretion may be severely limited to less than 30–40 mmol, 
and  the  accumulation  of  anions  of  retained  organic  acids  can  then 
lead  to  an  anion-gap  metabolic  acidosis.  Thus,  the  non-anion-gap 
metabolic acidosis seen in earlier stages of CKD may be complicated 
by the addition of an anion-gap metabolic acidosis as CKD progresses. 
In most patients, the metabolic acidosis is mild; the pH is rarely <7.32 
and can usually be corrected with oral sodium bicarbonate supplemen-
tation. Studies have suggested that even modest degrees of metabolic 
acidosis may be associated with the development of protein catabolism 
and progression of CKD.

TREATMENT
Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Disorders

Dietary  salt  restriction  and  the  use  of  loop  diuretics,  occa-
sionally  in  combination  with  metolazone,  may  be  needed  to 

maintain euvolemia. Water restriction is indicated only if there is 
hyponatremia.

Hyperkalemia often responds to dietary restriction of potassium, 
the use of kaliuretic diuretics, and both avoidance of potassium sup-
plements (including occult sources, such as dietary salt substitutes) 
and  dose  reduction  or  avoidance  of  potassium-retaining  medi-
cations  (especially  RAS  inhibitors).  Kaliuretic  diuretics  promote 
urinary  potassium  excretion,  whereas  potassium-binding  resins, 
such as calcium resonium, sodium polystyrene, or patiromer, can 
promote potassium loss through the GI tract and may reduce the 
incidence of hyperkalemia. Intractable hyperkalemia is an indica-
tion (although uncommon) to consider institution of dialysis in a 
CKD patient. The renal tubular acidosis and subsequent anion-gap 
metabolic acidosis in progressive CKD will respond to alkali sup-
plementation,  typically  with  sodium  bicarbonate.  Recent  studies 
suggest that this replacement should be considered when the serum 
bicarbonate concentration falls below 20–23 mmol/L to avoid the 
protein  catabolic  state  seen  with  even  mild  degrees  of  metabolic 
acidosis  and  to  slow  the  progression  of  CKD.  The  sodium  load 
in  sodium  bicarbonate  supplementation  needs  to  be  taken  into 
account, when ECFV expansion is present.

 ■ DISORDERS OF CALCIUM AND  
PHOSPHATE METABOLISM
The principal complications of abnormalities of calcium and phosphate 
metabolism in CKD occur in the skeleton and the vascular bed, with 
occasional involvement of soft tissues. It is likely that disorders of bone 
turnover  and  disorders  of  vascular  and  soft  tissue  calcification  are 
related to each other.

Bone  Manifestations  of  CKD  The  major  disorders  of  bone 
disease  can  be  classified  into  those  associated  with  high  bone  turn-
over with increased PTH levels (including osteitis fibrosa cystica, the 
classic lesion of secondary hyperparathyroidism), osteomalacia due to 
reduced effect of the active forms of vitamin D, and low bone turnover 
with low or normal PTH levels (adynamic bone disease) or most often 
combinations of the foregoing.

The  pathophysiology  of  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  and  the 
consequent high-turnover bone disease is related to abnormal mineral 
metabolism through the following series of interrelated mechanisms: 
(1) declining GFR leads to reduced excretion of phosphate and, thus, 
phosphate  retention;  (2)  the  retained  phosphate  stimulates  increased 
synthesis of both FGF-23 by osteocytes and of PTH and also stimulates 
growth of parathyroid gland mass; and (3) PTH production is stimu-
lated by decreased levels of ionized calcium, which, in turn, result from 
decreased  levels  of  renal  calcitriol  production  with  reduced  kidney 
mass and suppression of calcitriol production due to phosphate reten-
tion  and  elevated  levels  of  FGF-23,  which  also  increases  degradation 
of  calcitriol.  Low  calcitriol  levels  contribute  to  hyperparathyroidism, 
both  by  leading  to  hypocalcemia  and  also  by  a  direct  effect  on  PTH 
gene  transcription.  In  addition,  the  normal  inhibitory  effect  of  FGF-
23 on PTH production is Klotho-dependent and is also attenuated in 
CKD. These changes start to occur when the GFR falls below 60 mL/
min, though some studies point to retention of phosphate as an event 
antedating measurable reduction in GFR, together with early elevation 
of  FGF-23  as  well.  FGF-23  is  part  of  a  family  of  phosphatonins  that 
promotes phosphate excretion, and high levels of FGF-23 are an inde-
pendent risk factor for left ventricular hypertrophy and are associated 
with  increased  mortality  due  to  several  classes  of  complications  in 
CKD, dialysis, and kidney transplant patients.

Hyperparathyroidism stimulates bone turnover and leads to osteitis 
fibrosa cystica. Bone histology shows abnormal osteoid, bone and bone 
marrow fibrosis, and, in advanced stages, the formation of bone cysts, 
sometimes  with  hemorrhagic  elements  so  that  they  appear  brown  in 
color; hence, the term brown tumor. Clinical manifestations of severe 
hyperparathyroidism  include  bone  pain  and  fragility,  brown  tumors, 
compression  syndromes,  and  resistance  to  erythropoiesis-stimulating 
agents (ESA) in part related to the bone marrow fibrosis. Furthermore, 
PTH itself is considered a uremic toxin, and high levels are associated

FIGURE 311-4  Tumoral calcinosis. This patient was on hemodialysis for many years 
and  was  nonadherent  to  dietary  phosphorus  restriction  or  the  use  of  phosphate 
binders.  He  was  chronically  severely  hyperphosphatemic.  He  developed  an 
enlarging painful mass on his arm that was extensively calcified.

with  muscle  weakness,  fibrosis  of  cardiac  muscle,  and  constitutional 
symptoms.

Adynamic  bone  disease  is  increasing  in  prevalence,  especially 
among diabetics and older patients. It is characterized by reduced bone 
volume and mineralization and may result from excessive suppression 
of  PTH  production,  chronic  inflammation,  or  both.  Suppression  of 
PTH can result from the use of vitamin D preparations or from exces-
sive  calcium  exposure  in  the  form  of  calcium-containing  phosphate 
binders or high-calcium dialysis solutions.

Complications  of  adynamic  bone  disease  include  an  increased 
incidence of fracture and bone pain and an association with increased 
vascular  and  cardiac  calcification.  Occasionally,  the  calcium  will 
precipitate  in  the  soft  tissues  into  large  concretions  termed  tumoral 
calcinosis  (Fig.  311-4).  Patients  with  adynamic  bone  disease  often 
experience the most severe symptoms of musculoskeletal pain, owing 
to  the  inability  to  repair  the  microfractures  that  occur  normally  as 
a  part  of  healthy  skeletal  homeostasis  with  regular  physical  activity. 
Patients with advanced CKD experience more frequent fractures than 
their age-matched controls. Osteomalacia is a distinct process, conse-
quent  to  reduced  production  and  action  of  1,25(OH)2D3,  leading  to 
accumulation of nonmineralized osteoid.

Calcium, Phosphorus, and the Cardiovascular System  There 
is a strong association between hyperphosphatemia and increased car-
diovascular mortality in patients with CKD. Hyperphosphatemia and 
hypercalcemia are associated with increased vascular calcification, but 
it is unclear whether the excessive mortality is mediated by this mech-
anism. Studies using computed tomography (CT) and electron-beam 
CT scanning show that CKD patients have calcification in the media 
of  coronary  arteries  and  even  heart  valves  that  appears  to  be  orders 
of magnitude greater than that in patients without renal disease. The 
magnitude of the calcification is proportional to age and hyperphos-
phatemia  and  is  also  associated  with  low  PTH  levels  and  low  bone 
turnover. It is possible that in CKD patients ingested calcium cannot be 
incorporated into bones with low turnover and, therefore, is deposited 
at extraosseous sites, such as the vascular bed and soft tissues. There 
is a similar association between osteoporosis and vascular calcification 
in  the  general  population.  Finally,  hyperphosphatemia  can  induce  a 
change in gene expression in vascular cells to an osteoblast-like profile, 
leading to vascular calcification and even ossification.

Other  Complications  of  Abnormal  Mineral  Metabolism  
Calciphylaxis  is  a  devastating  condition  seen  almost  exclusively  in 
patients  with  advanced  CKD.  It  is  heralded  by  painful  livedo  retic-
ularis  and  subcutaneous  nodules  that  advance  to  patches  of  ische-
mic  necrosis,  especially  on  the  legs,  thighs,  abdomen,  and  breasts 
(Fig.  311-5).  Pathologically,  there  is  evidence  of  vascular  occlusion 

FIGURE  311-5  Calciphylaxis.  This  peritoneal  dialysis  patient  was  on  chronic 
warfarin  therapy  for  atrial  fibrillation.  She  noticed  a  small  painful  nodule  on 
the  abdomen  that  was  followed  by  progressive  skin  necrosis  and  ulceration 
of  the  anterior  abdominal  wall.  She  was  treated  with  hyperbaric  oxygen, 
intravenous thiosulfate, and discontinuation of warfarin, with slow resolution 
of the ulceration.

in association with extensive vascular and soft tissue calcification. It 
appears that this condition is increasing in incidence. Originally it was 
ascribed to severe abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus control 
in  dialysis  patients,  usually  associated  with  advanced  hyperparathy-
roidism.  However,  more  recently,  calciphylaxis  has  been  seen  with 
increasing  frequency  in  the  absence  of  severe  hyperparathyroidism. 
Warfarin  is  still  used  in  some  dialysis  patients  in  whom  direct  oral 
anticoagulants (DOACs) are contraindicated, and one of the effects of 
warfarin  therapy  is  to  decrease  the  vitamin  K–dependent  activation 
of matrix GLA protein. This latter protein is important in preventing 
vascular  calcification.  Thus,  warfarin  treatment  is  considered  a  risk 
factor for calciphylaxis, and if a patient develops this syndrome, this 
medication should be discontinued and alternative means of antico-
agulation  should  be  chosen,  depending  on  the  specific  underlying 
indication for anticoagulation.

TREATMENT
Disorders of Calcium and Phosphate Metabolism

The  optimal  management  of  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  and 
osteitis  fibrosa  is  prevention.  Once  the  parathyroid  gland  mass  is 
very  large,  it  is  difficult  to  control  the  disease.  Careful  attention 
should  be  paid  to  the  plasma  phosphate  concentration  in  CKD 
patients, who should be counseled on a low-phosphate diet as well 
as  the  appropriate  use  of  phosphate-binding  agents,  which  are 
taken  with  meals  and  complex  dietary  phosphate  to  limit  its  GI 
absorption. Examples of phosphate binders are calcium acetate and 
calcium carbonate. A major side effect of calcium-based phosphate 
binders  is  calcium  accumulation  and  hypercalcemia,  especially  in 
patients with low-turnover bone disease. Sevelamer and lanthanum 
are  non-calcium-containing  polymers  that  also  function  as  phos-
phate  binders;  they  do  not  predispose  CKD  patients  to  hypercal-
cemia  and  may  attenuate  calcium  deposition  in  the  vascular  bed. 
Tenapanor  is  a  sodium-proton  inhibitor  that  decreases  GI  phos-
phate absorption and may be useful to manage hyperphosphatemia 
in CKD and dialysis patients.

Calcitriol exerts a direct suppressive effect on PTH secretion and 
also indirectly suppresses PTH secretion by raising the concentra-
tion of ionized calcium. However, calcitriol therapy may result in 
hypercalcemia  and/or  hyperphosphatemia  through  increased  GI 
absorption  of  these  minerals.  Certain  analogues  of  calcitriol  are 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2314

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractavailable  (e.g.,  paricalcitol)  that  suppress  PTH  secretion  with  less 
attendant hypercalcemia.

Recognition  of  the  role  of  the  extracellular  calcium-sensing 
receptor  has  led  to  the  development  of  calcimimetic  agents  that 
enhance the sensitivity of parathyroid cells to the suppressive effect 
of calcium. This class of drug, which includes cinacalcet and etel-
calcetide, produces a dose-dependent reduction in PTH and plasma 
calcium concentration in some patients.

Current National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes 
Quality Initiative guidelines recommend a target PTH level between 
2 and 9 times the upper limit of normal, recognizing that very low 
PTH levels are associated with adynamic bone disease and possible 
consequences of fracture and ectopic calcification.

 ■ CARDIOVASCULAR ABNORMALITIES
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
in patients at every stage of CKD. The incremental risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease in those with CKD compared to the age- and sex-matched 
general population ranges from 10- to 200-fold, depending on the stage 
of CKD. As a result, most patients with CKD succumb to cardiovascu-
lar disease (Fig. 311-6) before ever reaching stage 5 CKD. Between 30 
and 45% of those patients who do reach stage 5 CKD have advanced 
significant  cardiovascular  complications.  Thus,  the  focus  of  patient 
care in earlier CKD stages should be directed to prevention of cardio-
vascular complications.

Vascular  Disease  The  increased  prevalence  of  vascular  disease 
in CKD patients derives from both traditional (“classic”) and nontra-
ditional  (CKD-related)  risk  factors.  Traditional  risk  factors  include 
hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  hypervolemia,  dyslipidemia,  sympa-
thetic overactivity, and hyperhomocysteinemia. The CKD-related risk 
factors  comprise  anemia,  hyperphosphatemia,  hyperparathyroidism, 
increased  FGF-23,  sleep  apnea,  and  systemic  inflammation.  The 
inflammatory  state  appears  to  accelerate  vascular  occlusive  disease, 
and low levels of fetuin may permit more rapid vascular calcification, 
especially in the face of hyperphosphatemia. Other abnormalities seen 
in CKD may augment myocardial ischemia, including left ventricular 
hypertrophy  and  microvascular  disease.  In  addition,  hemodialysis, 
with  its  attendant  episodes  of  hypotension  and  hypovolemia,  may 
further aggravate coronary ischemia and repeatedly stun the myocar-
dium.  Interestingly,  however,  the  largest  increment  in  cardiovascular 
mortality rate in dialysis patients is not necessarily directly associated 
with acute myocardial infarction but, instead, is the result of congestive 
heart  failure  and  sudden  death.  ECG  monitoring  studies  have  sug-
gested that asystole and bradyarrhythmias are the principal causes of 
sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients.

Cardiac  troponin  levels  are  frequently  elevated  in  CKD  without 
evidence of acute ischemia. The elevation complicates the diagnosis of 
acute  myocardial  infarction  in  this  population.  Serial  measurements 
may  be  needed.  Therefore,  the  trend  in  levels  over  the  hours  after 
presentation  may  be  more  informative  than  a  single,  elevated  level. 
Interestingly, consistently elevated levels are an independent prognos-
tic factor for adverse cardiovascular events.

Heart  Failure  Abnormal  cardiac  function  secondary  to  myocar-
dial ischemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and 
frank  cardiomyopathy,  in  combination  with  salt  and  water  retention, 
often results in heart failure or even pulmonary edema. Heart failure 
can be a consequence of diastolic or systolic dysfunction, or both. A 
form of “low-pressure” pulmonary edema can also occur in advanced 
CKD, manifesting as shortness of breath and a “bat wing” distribution 
of alveolar edema fluid on chest x-ray. This finding can occur even in 
the absence of ECFV overload and is associated with normal or mildly 
elevated  pulmonary  capillary  wedge  pressure.  This  process  has  been 
ascribed to increased permeability of alveolar capillary membranes as 
a manifestation of the uremic state, and it responds to dialysis. Other 
CKD-related risk factors, including anemia and sleep apnea, may con-
tribute to the risk of heart failure.

Hypertension  and  left  ventricular  hypertrophy  are  the  most  com-
mon  complications  of  CKD.  Hypertension  usually  develops  early 
during  the  course  of  CKD  and  is  associated  with  adverse  outcomes, 
including  the  development  of  ventricular  hypertrophy  and  a  more 
rapid loss of renal function. Left ventricular hypertrophy and dilated 
cardiomyopathy are among the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD and are thought to be 
related  primarily,  but  not  exclusively,  to  prolonged  hypertension  and 
ECFV overload. In addition, anemia and the placement of an arterio-
venous fistula for hemodialysis can generate a high cardiac output state 
and consequent high-output heart failure.

The  absence  of  hypertension  may  signify  poor  left  ventricular 
function.  Indeed,  in  epidemiologic  studies  of  dialysis  patients,  low 
blood pressure actually carries a worse prognosis than does high blood 
pressure. This mechanism, in part, accounts for the “reverse causation” 
seen in dialysis patients, wherein the presence of traditional risk fac-
tors,  such  as  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,  and  obesity,  appear  to 
portend  a  better  prognosis.  Importantly,  these  observations  derive 
from  cross-sectional  studies  of  late-stage  CKD  patients  and  should 
not  be  interpreted  to  discourage  appropriate  management  of  these 
risk factors in CKD patients, especially at early stages. In contrast to 
the general population, it is possible that in late-stage CKD, low blood 
pressure,  reduced  body  mass  index,  and  hypolipidemia  indicate  the 
presence  of  an  advanced  malnutrition-inflammation  state,  with  the 
attendant poor prognosis.

The  use  of  exogenous  ESAs  can  increase  blood  pressure  and  the 
requirement  for  antihypertensive  drugs.  Chronic  ECFV  overload  is 
also a contributor to hypertension, and improvement in blood pressure 
can often be seen with the use of dietary sodium restriction, diuretics, 
and fluid removal with dialysis. Nevertheless, because of activation of 
the RAS and other disturbances in the balance of vasoconstrictors and 
vasodilators, some patients remain hypertensive, despite careful atten-
tion to ECFV status.

TREATMENT
Cardiovascular Abnormalities

MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION
The overarching goal of hypertension therapy in CKD is to prevent 
the  extrarenal  complications  of  high  blood  pressure,  such  as  car-
diovascular disease and stroke. Although a clear-cut generalizable 
benefit  in  slowing  progression  of  CKD  remains  as  yet  unproven, 
the  benefit  for  cardiac  and  cerebrovascular  health  is  compelling. 
In  all  patients  with  CKD,  blood  pressure  should  be  controlled  to 
levels recommended by national guideline panels. In CKD patients 
with diabetes or proteinuria >1 g per 24 h, blood pressure should

be  reduced  to  <130/80  mmHg,  if  achievable  without  prohibitive 
adverse  effects.  Salt  restriction  should  be  the  first  line  of  therapy. 
When  volume  management  alone  is  not  sufficient,  the  choice  of 
antihypertensive agent is similar to that in the general population. 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin 
receptor  blockers  (ARBs)  appear  to  slow  the  rate  of  decline  of 
kidney function in a manner that extends beyond reduction of sys-
temic arterial pressure and that involves reduction in the intraglom-
erular hyperfiltration and hypertension. Occasionally, introduction 
of ACE inhibitors and ARBs can actually precipitate an episode of 
AKI, especially when used in combination in patients with ischemic 
renovascular disease.

Slight reduction of GFR (<30% of baseline) may signify a salu-
tary reduction in intraglomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration, 
and, if stable over time, can be tolerated with continued monitoring. 
Progressive decline in GFR should prompt discontinuation of these 
agents. The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also be compli-
cated by the development of hyperkalemia. Often the concomitant 
use of a combination of kaliuretic diuretics (e.g., furosemide with 
metolazone) or a potassium-lowering GI tract binder, such as pat-
iromer, can improve potassium excretion in addition to improving 
blood  pressure  control.  Potassium-sparing  diuretics,  such  as  ami-
loride  and  triamterene,  should  be  avoided  in  most  patients,  and 
mineralocorticoid receptor blockers should also be used with great 
caution and with careful monitoring of serum potassium concen-
tration, weighing potential cardiovascular benefits against risk for 
lethal hyperkalemia.

The  recent  movement  to  even  lower  blood  pressure  targets 
in  the  general  population  may  not  be  applicable  to  patients  with 
CKD,  who  often  lack  autoregulation  to  maintain  GFR  in  the  face 
of low perfusion pressure. If a patient experiences sudden decline 
in kidney function with intensification of antihypertensive therapy, 
consideration should be given to reducing therapy. 
MANAGEMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
There  are  many  strategies  available  to  treat  the  traditional  and 
nontraditional  risk  factors  in  CKD  patients.  Although  these  have 
proved  effective  in  the  general  population,  there  is  little  evidence 
for their benefit in patients with advanced CKD, especially those on 
dialysis. Certainly, hypertension and dyslipidemia promote athero-
sclerotic disease and are treatable complications of CKD. Renal dis-
ease complicated by nephrotic syndrome is associated with a very 
atherogenic  lipid  profile  and  hypercoagulability,  which  increases 
the risk of occlusive vascular disease. Because diabetes mellitus and 
hypertension are the two most frequent causes of advanced CKD, 
it is not surprising that cardiovascular disease is the most frequent 
cause of death in dialysis patients. The use of the gliflozins (SGLT2 
inhibitors)  in  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus  has  recently  been 
associated with kidney protection and a reduction in cardiovascular 
events, including heart failure. Currently under study is the feasibil-
ity of using gliflozins in nondiabetic CKD.

The role of “inflammation” may be quantitatively more impor-
tant  in  patients  with  kidney  disease,  and  the  treatment  of  more 
traditional risk factors may result in only modest success. However, 
modulation of traditional risk factors may be the only weapon in 
the therapeutic armamentarium for these patients until the nature 
of inflammation in CKD and its treatment are better understood.

Pericardial  Disease  Chest  pain  with  respiratory  accentuation, 
accompanied  by  a  friction  rub,  is  diagnostic  of  pericarditis.  Classic 
electrocardiographic abnormalities include PR-interval depression and 
diffuse ST-segment elevation. Pericarditis can be accompanied by peri-
cardial effusion that is seen on echocardiography and can rarely lead 
to tamponade. However, the pericardial effusion can be asymptomatic, 
and pericarditis can be seen without significant effusion.

Pericarditis is observed in advanced uremia and, with the advent of 
timely initiation of dialysis, is not as common as it once was. It is now 
more  often  observed  in  underdialyzed,  nonadherent  patients  than  in 
those starting dialysis.

TREATMENT
Pericardial Disease

Uremic pericarditis is an absolute indication for the urgent ini-
tiation of dialysis or for intensification of the dialysis prescription 
in  those  already  receiving  dialysis.  Because  of  the  propensity  to 
hemorrhage in pericardial fluid, hemodialysis should be performed 
without heparin. A pericardial drainage procedure should be con-
sidered  in  patients  with  recurrent  pericardial  effusion,  especially 
with  echocardiographic  signs  of  impending  tamponade.  Nonure-
mic  causes  of  pericarditis  and  effusion  include  viral,  malignant, 
tuberculous, and autoimmune etiologies. It may also be seen after 
myocardial infarction and as a complication of treatment with the 
antihypertensive  drug  minoxidil.  Consideration  could  be  given 
to  the  use  of  colchicine  or  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs, 
although the latter agents could adversely affect renal function.

 ■ HEMATOLOGIC ABNORMALITIES
Anemia  A normocytic, normochromic anemia is observed as early 
as stage 3 CKD and is almost universal by stage 4. The primary cause 
is insufficient production of erythropoietin (EPO) by the diseased kid-
neys. Additional factors are reviewed in Table 311-5.

The anemia of CKD is associated with a number of adverse patho-
physiologic consequences, including decreased tissue oxygen delivery 
and  utilization,  increased  cardiac  output,  ventricular  dilation,  and 
ventricular  hypertrophy.  Clinical  manifestations  include  fatigue  and 
diminished exercise tolerance, angina, heart failure, decreased cogni-
tion and mental acuity, and impaired host defense against infection. In 
addition, anemia may play a role in growth restriction in children with 
CKD. Although many studies in CKD patients have found that anemia 
and resistance to exogenous ESAs are associated with a poor progno-
sis, the relative contribution to a poor outcome of the low hematocrit 
itself, versus inflammation as a cause of the anemia and ESA resistance, 
remains unclear.

TREATMENT
Anemia

The  availability  of  recombinant  human  ESA  has  been  one  of  the 
most  significant  advances  in  the  care  of  renal  patients  since  the 
introduction  of  dialysis  and  renal  transplantation.  Its  routine  use 
has  obviated  the  need  for  regular  blood  transfusions  in  severely 
anemic CKD patients, thus dramatically reducing the incidence of 
transfusion-associated infections and iron overload.

Frequent  blood  transfusions  in  dialysis  patients  also  lead  to 
the  development  of  alloantibodies  that  can  sensitize  the  patient 
to  donor  kidney  antigens  and  make  kidney  transplantation  more 
problematic.

Adequate  bone  marrow  iron  stores  should  be  available  before 
treatment  with  ESA  is  initiated.  Iron  supplementation  is  usually 
essential  to  ensure  an  optimal  response  to  ESA  in  patients  with 
CKD  because  the  demand  for  iron  by  the  marrow  frequently 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2316

20/01/22   8:48 PM

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractexceeds  the  amount  of  iron  that  is  immediately  available  for  ery-
thropoiesis  (measured  by  percent  transferrin  saturation),  as  well 
as the amount in iron stores (measured by serum ferritin). For the 
CKD  patient  not  yet  on  dialysis  or  the  patient  treated  with  peri-
toneal  dialysis,  oral  iron  supplementation  should  be  attempted.  If 
there is GI intolerance or poor GI absorption, the patient may have 
to undergo IV iron infusion. For patients on hemodialysis, IV iron 
can be administered during dialysis, keeping in mind that parent-
eral iron therapy can increase the susceptibility to bacterial infec-
tions and that the adverse effects of free serum iron are still under 
investigation. In addition to iron, an adequate supply of other major 
substrates  and  cofactors  for  red  cell  production  must  be  ensured, 
including vitamin B12 and folate. Anemia resistant to recommended 
doses of ESA in the face of adequate iron stores may be due to some 
combination of the following: acute or chronic inflammation, inad-
equate dialysis, severe hyperparathyroidism, chronic blood loss or 
hemolysis, chronic infection, or malignancy.

A  new  class  of  agents  to  treat  the  anemia  of  CKD  are  the 
prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors of endogenous hypoxia-inducible fac-
tors (HIFs). This inhibition leads to an increase in both endogenous 
production of EPO and an increase in GI absorption of iron. Studies 
are in progress comparing the efficacy of these agents to the stan-
dard ESAs.

Randomized, controlled trials of ESA in CKD have failed to show 
an  improvement  in  cardiovascular  outcomes  with  this  therapy. 
Indeed, there has been an indication that the use of ESA in CKD 
may  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  stroke  in  those  with 
type 2 diabetes or an increase in thromboembolic events and per-
haps a faster progression of renal decline.

Therefore, any benefit in terms of improvement of anemic symp-
toms needs to be balanced against the potential cardiovascular risk. 
Although further studies are needed, it is quite clear that normaliza-
tion of the hemoglobin concentration has not been demonstrated 
to be of incremental benefit to CKD patients. Current practice is to 
target a hemoglobin concentration of 100–115 g/L.

Abnormal  Hemostasis  Patients  with  later  stages  of  CKD  may 
have a prolonged bleeding time, decreased activity of platelet factor III, 
abnormal platelet aggregation and adhesiveness, and impaired proth-
rombin  consumption.  Clinical  manifestations  include  an  increased 
tendency to bleeding and bruising, prolonged bleeding from surgical 
incisions,  menorrhagia,  and  GI  bleeding.  Interestingly,  CKD  patients 
also  have  a  greater  susceptibility  to  thromboembolism,  especially  if 
they have renal disease that includes nephrotic-range proteinuria. The 
latter condition results in hypoalbuminemia and renal loss of anticoag-
ulant factors, which can lead to a thrombophilic state.

TREATMENT
Abnormal Hemostasis

Abnormal  bleeding  time  and  coagulopathy  in  patients  with  renal 
failure may be reversed temporarily with desmopressin (DDAVP), 
cryoprecipitate,  IV  conjugated  estrogens,  blood  transfusions,  and 
ESA  therapy.  Optimal  dialysis  will  usually  correct  a  prolonged 
bleeding time.

Given  the  coexistence  of  bleeding  disorders  and  a  propensity 
to thrombosis that is unique in the CKD patient, decisions about 
anticoagulation that have a favorable risk-benefit profile in the gen-
eral population may not be applicable to the patient with advanced 
CKD. One example is warfarin anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation; 
the decision to anticoagulate should be made on an individual basis 
in  the  CKD  patient  because  there  appears  to  be  a  greater  risk  of 
bleeding complications.

Certain anticoagulants, such as fractionated low-molecular-weight 
heparin, may need to be avoided or dose-adjusted in these patients, 
with  monitoring  of  factor  Xa  activity  where  available.  It  is  often 
more prudent to use conventional unfractionated heparin, titrated 
to  the  measured  partial  thromboplastin  time,  in  hospitalized 

patients  requiring  an  alternative  to  warfarin  anticoagulation.  The 
new classes of oral anticoagulants are all, in part, renally eliminated 
and  need  to  be  avoided  or  dose  adjusted  in  the  face  of  decreased 
GFR (Chap. 118).

 ■ NEUROMUSCULAR ABNORMALITIES
Central  nervous  system  (CNS),  peripheral,  and  autonomic  neuropa-
thy, as well as abnormalities in muscle structure and function, are all 
well-recognized complications of CKD. Subtle clinical manifestations 
of  uremic  neuromuscular  disease  usually  become  evident  at  stage  3 
CKD.

Early  manifestations  of  CNS  complications  include  mild  distur-
bances  in  memory  and  disturbances  in  concentration  and  sleep. 
Neuromuscular irritability, including hiccups, cramps, and twitching, 
becomes evident at later stages. In advanced untreated kidney failure, 
asterixis, myoclonus, seizures, and coma can be seen.

Peripheral  neuropathy  usually  becomes  clinically  evident  after  the 
patient  reaches  stage  4  CKD,  although  electrophysiologic  and  histo-
logic  evidence  occurs  earlier.  Initially,  sensory  nerves  are  involved 
more than motor, lower extremities more than upper, and distal parts 
of  the  extremities  more  than  proximal.  The  “restless  leg  syndrome” 
is  characterized  by  ill-defined  sensations  of  sometimes  debilitating 
discomfort in the legs and feet relieved by frequent leg movement. Evi-
dence  of  peripheral  neuropathy  without  another  cause  (e.g.,  diabetes 
mellitus or iron deficiency) is an indication for starting renal replace-
ment therapy. Many of the complications described above will resolve 
with dialysis, although subtle nonspecific abnormalities may persist.
 ■ GASTROINTESTINAL AND  
NUTRITIONAL ABNORMALITIES
Uremic fetor, a urine-like odor on the breath, derives from the break-
down  of  urea  to  ammonia  in  saliva  and  is  often  associated  with  an 
unpleasant  metallic  taste  (dysgeusia).  Gastritis,  peptic  disease,  and 
mucosal ulcerations at any level of the GI tract occur in uremic patients 
and  can  lead  to  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  GI  bleeding. 
These patients are also prone to constipation, which can be worsened 
by the administration of calcium and iron supplements. The retention 
of uremic toxins also leads to anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.

Protein restriction may be useful to decrease nausea and vomiting; 
however,  it  may  put  the  patient  at  risk  for  malnutrition  and  should 
be  carried  out,  if  possible,  in  consultation  with  a  registered  dietitian 
specializing  in  the  management  of  CKD  patients.  Weight  loss  and 
protein-energy malnutrition, consequences of low protein and caloric 
intake, are common in advanced CKD and are often an indication for 
initiation  of  renal  replacement  therapy.  Metabolic  acidosis  and  the 
activation of inflammatory cytokines can promote protein catabolism. 
A number of indices are useful in nutritional assessment and include 
dietary history, including food diary, and subjective global assessment; 
edema-free body weight; and measurement of urinary protein nitrogen 
appearance. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry bioimpedance analysis 
is  now  widely  used  to  estimate  lean  body  mass  versus  fluid  weight. 
Nutritional  guidelines  for  patients  with  CKD  are  summarized  in  the 
“Treatment” section.
 ■ ENDOCRINE-METABOLIC DISTURBANCES
Glucose  metabolism  is  impaired  in  CKD.  However,  fasting  blood 
glucose  is  usually  normal  or  only  slightly  elevated,  and  mild  glucose 
intolerance  does  not  require  specific  therapy.  Because  the  kidney 
contributes  to  insulin  removal  from  the  circulation,  plasma  levels  of 
insulin  are  slightly  to  moderately  elevated  in  most  uremic  patients, 
both in the fasting and postprandial states. Because of this diminished 
renal  degradation  of  insulin,  patients  on  insulin  therapy  may  need 
progressive  reduction  in  dose  as  their  renal  function  worsens.  Many 
anti-hyperglycemic agents, including the gliptins, require dose reduc-
tion in renal failure, and some, such as metformin and sulfonylureas, 
are contraindicated when the GFR is less than half of normal. The gli-
flozins, discussed above, that inhibit sodium-glucose transport in the 
proximal  tubule  result  in  glucose  lowering,  accompanied  by  striking 
reductions  in  kidney  function  decline  and  in  cardiovascular  events.

2318 The stabilization of GFR in many patients with this therapeutic inter-
vention represents a major, important added beneficial effect of these 
drugs.  Their  long-term  stabilizing  effect  on  GFR  and  urine  albumin 
excretion appears to result from correction of hyperfiltration early in 
type 2 diabetes mellitus via reactivation of the tubuloglomerular feed-
back loop. This represents a fortunate convergence of pathophysiology 
of glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes with drug discovery. A similar 
effect  on  hyperfiltration  by  residual  nephrons  in  certain  nondiabetic 
forms of CKD may explain the salutary role of this class of medications 
more broadly in CKD. Other studies have also pointed to a more direct 
effect on proximal tubule metabolic pathways that alleviate cell injury.
In women with CKD, estrogen levels are low, and menstrual abnor-
malities,  infertility,  and  inability  to  carry  pregnancies  to  term  are 
common. When the GFR has declined to ~40 mL/min, pregnancy is 
associated with a high rate of spontaneous abortion, with only ~20% 
of  pregnancies  leading  to  live  births,  and  pregnancy  may  hasten  the 
progression  of  the  kidney  disease  itself.  Women  with  CKD  who  are 
contemplating  pregnancy  should  consult  first  with  a  nephrologist  in 
conjunction with an obstetrician specializing in high-risk pregnancy. 
Men  with  CKD  have  reduced  plasma  testosterone  levels,  and  sexual 
dysfunction and oligospermia may supervene. Sexual maturation may 
be delayed or impaired in adolescent children with CKD, even among 
those  treated  with  dialysis.  Many  of  these  abnormalities  improve  or 
reverse with intensive dialysis or with successful renal transplantation.
 ■ DERMATOLOGIC ABNORMALITIES
Abnormalities of the skin are prevalent in progressive CKD. Pruritus 
is  quite  common  and  one  of  the  most  vexing  manifestations  of  the 
uremic state. In advanced CKD, even on dialysis, patients may become 
more  pigmented,  and  this  is  felt  to  reflect  the  deposition  of  retained 
pigmented  metabolites,  or  urochromes.  Although  many  of  the  cuta-
neous abnormalities improve with dialysis, pruritus is often tenacious. 
The first lines of management are to rule out unrelated skin disorders, 
such as scabies, and to treat hyperphosphatemia, which can cause itch. 
Local  moisturizers,  mild  topical  glucocorticoids,  oral  antihistamines, 
and  ultraviolet  radiation  have  been  reported  to  be  helpful.  Recently, 
agonists  of  kappa  opioid  receptors  have  shown  promise  in  reducing 
pruritis in hemodialysis patients.

A  skin  condition  unique  to  CKD  patients  called  nephrogenic 
fibrosing dermopathy consists of progressive subcutaneous induration, 
especially  on  the  arms  and  legs.  The  condition  is  seen  very  rarely  in 
patients with CKD who have been exposed to the magnetic resonance 
contrast agent gadolinium. Current recommendations are that patients 
with CKD stage 3 (GFR 30–59 mL/min) should minimize exposure to 
gadolinium and those with CKD stages 4–5 (GFR <30 mL/min) should 
avoid  the  use  of  gadolinium  agents  unless  it  is  medically  necessary. 
However, no patient should be denied an imaging investigation that is 
critical to management, and under such circumstances, rapid removal 
of gadolinium by hemodialysis (even in patients not yet receiving renal 
replacement  therapy)  shortly  after  the  procedure  may  mitigate  this 
sometimes devastating complication.

EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF 
PATIENTS WITH CKD
 ■ INITIAL APPROACH
History and Physical Examination  Symptoms  and  overt  signs 
of kidney disease are often subtle or absent until renal failure super-
venes.  Thus,  the  diagnosis  of  kidney  disease  often  surprises  patients 
and may be a cause of skepticism and denial. Particular aspects of the 
history  that  are  germane  to  renal  disease  include  a  history  of  hyper-
tension (which can cause CKD or more commonly be a consequence 
of  CKD),  diabetes  mellitus,  abnormal  urinalyses,  and  problems  with 
pregnancy  such  as  preeclampsia  or  early  pregnancy  loss.  A  careful 
drug history should be elicited. Drugs to consider include nonsteroi-
dal  anti-inflammatory  agents,  cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2)  inhibitors, 
antimicrobials, chemotherapeutic agents, antiretroviral agents, proton 
pump inhibitors, phosphate-containing bowel cathartics, and lithium. 
In  evaluating  the  uremic  syndrome,  questions  about  appetite,  weight 

loss, nausea, hiccups, peripheral edema, muscle cramps, pruritus, and 
restless legs are especially helpful. A family history of kidney disease, 
together  with  assessment  of  manifestations  in  other  organ  systems 
such as auditory, visual, and integumentary, may lead to the diagnosis 
of a heritable form of CKD (e.g., Alport’s or Fabry’s disease, cystinosis) 
or  shared  environmental  exposure  to  nephrotoxic  agents  (e.g.,  heavy 
metals, aristolochic acid). It should be noted that clustering of CKD, 
sometimes of different etiologies, is often observed within families.

The physical examination should focus on blood pressure and target 
organ  damage  from  hypertension.  Thus,  funduscopy  and  precordial 
examination  should  be  carried  out.  Funduscopy  is  especially  impor-
tant in the diabetic patient, because it may show evidence of diabetic 
retinopathy,  which  is  associated  with  diabetic  nephropathy.  Other 
physical examination manifestations of CKD include edema and sen-
sory polyneuropathy. The finding of asterixis or a pericardial friction 
rub not attributable to other causes usually signifies the presence of the 
uremic syndrome.
Laboratory Investigation  Laboratory  studies  should  focus  on  a 
search for clues to an underlying causative or aggravating disease pro-
cess and on the degree of renal damage and its consequences. Serum 
and  urine  protein  electrophoresis,  looking  for  multiple  myeloma, 
should  be  obtained  in  all  patients  >35  years  old  with  unexplained 
CKD,  especially  if  there  is  associated  anemia  and  elevated,  or  even 
inappropriately  normal,  serum  calcium  concentration  in  the  face  of 
renal insufficiency. In the presence of glomerulonephritis, autoimmune 
diseases  such  as  lupus  and  underlying  infectious  etiologies  such  as 
hepatitis B and C and HIV should be tested. Serial measurements of 
renal function should be obtained to determine the pace of renal dete-
rioration and ensure that the disease is truly chronic rather than acute 
or subacute and hence potentially reversible. Serum concentrations of 
calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and PTH should be measured to eval-
uate metabolic bone disease. Hemoglobin concentration, iron, vitamin 
B12, and folate should also be evaluated. A 24-h urine collection may 
be  helpful,  because  protein  excretion  >300  mg  may  be  an  indication 
for therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and also is associated with a 
higher risk of progression.
Imaging Studies  The most useful imaging study is a renal ultra-
sound, which can verify the presence of two kidneys, determine if they 
are symmetric, provide an estimate of kidney size, and rule out renal 
masses and evidence of obstruction. Because it takes time for kidneys 
to shrink as a result of chronic disease, the finding of bilaterally small 
kidneys supports the diagnosis of CKD of long-standing duration. If 
the kidney size is normal, it is possible that the kidney disease is acute 
or  subacute.  The  exceptions  are  diabetic  nephropathy  (where  kidney 
size  is  increased  at  the  onset  of  diabetic  nephropathy  before  CKD 
supervenes),  amyloidosis,  and  HIV  nephropathy,  where  kidney  size 
may be normal in the face of CKD. Polycystic kidney disease that has 
reached  some  degree  of  renal  failure  will  almost  always  present  with 
enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts (Chap. 315). A discrepancy >1 cm 
in kidney length suggests either a unilateral developmental abnormality 
or a disease process or renovascular disease with arterial insufficiency 
affecting  one  kidney  more  than  the  other.  The  diagnosis  of  renovas-
cular  disease  can  be  undertaken  with  different  techniques,  including 
Doppler  sonography,  nuclear  medicine  studies,  or  CT  or  magnetic 
resonance  imaging  (MRI)  studies.  If  there  is  a  suspicion  of  reflux 
nephropathy (recurrent childhood urinary tract infection, asymmetric 
renal size with scars on the renal poles), a voiding cystogram may be 
indicated. However, in most cases, by the time the patient has CKD, the 
reflux has resolved, and even if still present, repair does not improve 
renal function. Radiographic contrast imaging studies are not partic-
ularly helpful in the investigation of CKD. Intravenous or intraarterial 
dye should be avoided where possible in the CKD patient, especially 
with diabetic nephropathy, because of the risk of radiographic contrast 
dye–induced renal failure. When unavoidable, appropriate precaution-
ary measures include avoidance of hypovolemia at the time of contrast 
exposure,  minimization  of  the  dye  load,  and  choice  of  radiographic 
contrast preparations with the least nephrotoxic potential. Additional 
measures  thought  to  attenuate  contrast-induced  worsening  of  renal

function  include  judicious  administration  of  sodium  bicarbonate– 
containing solutions and N-acetylcysteine, although these agents may 
not be as effective as previously thought.

Kidney  Biopsy 
In  the  patient  with  bilaterally  small  kidneys, 
renal  biopsy  is  not  advised  because  (1)  it  is  technically  difficult  and 
has  a  greater  likelihood  of  causing  bleeding  and  other  adverse  con-
sequences,  (2)  there  is  usually  so  much  scarring  that  the  underlying 
disease  may  not  be  apparent,  and  (3)  the  window  of  opportunity  to 
render disease-specific therapy has passed. Other contraindications to 
renal  biopsy  include  uncontrolled  hypertension,  active  urinary  tract 
infection, bleeding diathesis (including ongoing anticoagulation), and 
severe obesity. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy is the favored 
approach, but a surgical or laparoscopic approach can be considered, 
especially in the patient with a single kidney where direct visualization 
and  control  of  bleeding  are  crucial.  In  the  CKD  patient  in  whom  a 
kidney biopsy is indicated (e.g., suspicion of a concomitant or super-
imposed  active  process  such  as  interstitial  nephritis  or  in  the  face  of 
accelerated loss of GFR), the bleeding time should be measured, and 
if increased, desmopressin should be administered immediately prior 
to the procedure.

A brief run of hemodialysis (without heparin) may also be consid-

ered prior to renal biopsy to normalize the bleeding time.
 ■ ESTABLISHING THE DIAGNOSIS AND  
ETIOLOGY OF CKD
The  most  important  initial  diagnostic  step  is  to  distinguish  newly 
diagnosed CKD from acute or subacute renal failure, because the latter 
two  conditions  may  respond  to  targeted  therapy.  Previous  measure-
ments  of  serum  creatinine  concentration  are  particularly  helpful  in 
this regard. Normal values from recent months or even years suggest 
that the current extent of renal dysfunction could be more acute, and 
hence  reversible,  than  might  otherwise  be  appreciated.  In  contrast, 
elevated serum creatinine concentration in the past suggests that the 
renal  disease  represents  a  chronic  process.  Even  if  there  is  evidence 
of chronicity, there is the possibility of a superimposed acute process 
(e.g., ECFV depletion, urinary infection or obstruction, or nephrotoxin 
exposure) supervening on the chronic condition. If the history suggests 
multiple systemic manifestations of recent onset (e.g., fever, polyarthri-
tis,  rash),  it  should  be  assumed  that  renal  insufficiency  is  part  of  an 
acute systemic illness.

Although  kidney  biopsy  can  usually  be  performed  in  early  CKD 
(stages 1–3), it is not always indicated. For example, in a patient with 
a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus for 15–20 years with retinopathy, 
nephrotic-range  proteinuria,  and  absence  of  hematuria,  the  diagno-
sis  of  diabetic  nephropathy  is  very  likely  and  biopsy  is  usually  not 
necessary. However, if there is another finding not typical of diabetic 
nephropathy, such as hematuria or white blood cell casts, or absence of 
diabetic retinopathy, some other disease may be present and a biopsy 
may be indicated.

In  the  absence  of  a  clinical  diagnosis,  kidney  biopsy  may  be  the 
only  recourse  to  establish  an  etiology  in  early-stage  CKD.  However, 
as noted above, once the CKD is advanced and the kidneys are small 
and scarred, there is little utility and significant risk in attempting to 
arrive  at  a  specific  diagnosis.  Genetic  testing  using  a  combination  of 
chromosomal microarray and whole exome sequencing is increasingly 
entering the repertoire of diagnostic tests since the patterns of injury 
and kidney morphologic abnormalities often reflect overlapping causal 
mechanisms, whose origins can sometimes be attributed to a genetic 
predisposition or cause (Table 311-2).

TREATMENT
Chronic Kidney Disease

Treatments  aimed  at  specific  causes  of  CKD  are  discussed  else-
where.  Two  recent  developments  in  the  etiology-directed  therapy 
of CKD include the now-proven role of gliflozins in diabetic kidney 
disease and the emergence of genome-specific therapies now estab-
lished  for  certain  patients  with  ADPKD  (Chap.  315),  which  are 

at  the  clinical  trial  stage  for  APOL1-mediated  kidney  disease  and 
certain forms of hyperoxaluria. The optimal timing of both specific 
and nonspecific therapy is usually well before there has been a mea-
surable decline in GFR and certainly before CKD is established. It is 
helpful to measure sequentially and plot the rate of decline of GFR 
in all patients. Any acceleration in the rate of decline should prompt 
a search for superimposed acute or subacute processes that may be 
reversible. These include ECFV depletion, uncontrolled hyperten-
sion, urinary tract infection, new obstructive uropathy, exposure to 
nephrotoxic agents (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
[NSAIDs]  or  radiographic  dye),  and  reactivation  or  flare  of  the 
original disease, such as lupus or vasculitis. 
SLOWING THE PROGRESSION OF CKD
There is variation in the rate of decline of GFR among patients with 
CKD. However, the following interventions should be considered in 
an effort to stabilize or slow the decline of renal function. 
Reducing Intraglomerular Hypertension and Proteinuria 
Increased 
intraglomerular  filtration  pressures  and  glomerular  hypertrophy 
develop  as  a  response  to  loss  of  nephron  number.  This  response 
is maladaptive as it promotes the ongoing decline of kidney func-
tion even if the inciting process has been treated or spontaneously 
resolved.  Control  of  glomerular  hypertension  is  important  in 
slowing the progression of CKD. Moreover, elevated blood pressure 
increases  proteinuria  by  increasing  its  flux  across  the  glomerular 
capillaries.  Conversely,  the  renoprotective  effect  of  antihyperten-
sive  medications  is  gauged  through  the  consequent  reduction  of 
proteinuria.  Thus,  the  more  effective  a  given  treatment  is  in  low-
ering  protein  excretion,  the  greater  is  the  subsequent  impact  on 
protection  from  decline  in  GFR.  This  observation  is  the  basis  for 
the treatment guideline establishing 130/80 mmHg as a target blood 
pressure in proteinuric CKD patients.

Several controlled studies have shown that ACE inhibitors and 
ARBs are effective in slowing the progression of renal failure in 
patients  with  advanced  stages  of  both  diabetic  and  nondiabetic 
CKD,  in  large  part  through  effects  on  efferent  vasodilatation 
and  the  subsequent  decline  in  glomerular  hypertension.  In  the 
absence of an anti-proteinuric response with either agent alone, 
combined  treatment  with  both  ACE  inhibitors  and  ARBs  has 
been  considered.  The  combination  is  associated  with  a  greater 
reduction in proteinuria compared to either agent alone. Insofar 
as  reduction  in  proteinuria  is  a  surrogate  for  improved  renal 
outcome,  the  combination  would  appear  to  be  advantageous. 
However, there is a greater incidence of AKI and adverse cardiac 
events  from  such  combination  therapy.  On  balance,  therefore, 
ACE inhibitor plus ARB therapy should be avoided. A progres-
sive increase in serum creatinine concentration with these agents 
may suggest the presence of renovascular disease within the large 
or small arteries.

Among  the  calcium  channel  blockers,  diltiazem  and  verapamil 
may  exhibit  superior  antiproteinuric  and  renoprotective  effects 
compared to the dihydropyridines. At least two different categories 
of response can be considered: one in which progression is strongly 
associated  with  systemic  and  intraglomerular  hypertension  and 
proteinuria  (e.g.,  diabetic  nephropathy,  glomerular  diseases)  and 
in  which  ACE  inhibitors  and  ARBs  are  recommended  choices, 
and  another  in  which  proteinuria  is  mild  or  absent  initially  (e.g., 
ADPKD  and  other  tubulointerstitial  diseases),  where  the  con-
tribution  of  intraglomerular  hypertension  is  less  prominent  and 
other antihypertensive agents can be useful for control of systemic 
hypertension. 
MANAGING OTHER COMPLICATIONS OF CKD
Medication Dose Adjustment  Although the loading dose of most 
drugs  is  not  affected  by  CKD  because  renal  elimination  is  not 
used in the calculation, the maintenance doses of many drugs will 
need to be adjusted. For those agents in which >70% excretion is 
by a nonrenal route, such as hepatic elimination, dose adjustment 
may  not  be  needed.  Some  drugs  that  should  be  avoided  include 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2319

2320 metformin,  meperidine,  and  oral  anti-hyperglycemics  that  are 
eliminated  by  the  kidney.  NSAIDs  should  be  avoided  because  of 
the risk of further worsening of kidney function. Many antibiotics, 
antihypertensives, and antiarrhythmics may require a reduction in 
dosage  or  change  in  the  dose  interval.  Several  online  Web-based 
databases  for  dose  adjustment  of  medications  according  to  stage 
of CKD or estimated GFR are available (e.g., http://www.globalrph 
.com/index_renal.htm). Nephrotoxic radiocontrast agents and gad-
olinium  should  be  avoided  or  used  according  to  strict  guidelines 
when medically necessary, as discussed above. 

PREPARATION FOR RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY
(See  also  Chap.  313)  Temporary  relief  of  symptoms  and  signs  of 
impending  uremia,  such  as  anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  lassitude, 
and  pruritus,  may  sometimes  be  achieved  with  dietary  protein 
restriction. However, this diet carries a risk of malnutrition; thus, 
plans for more long-term management should be in place.

Maintenance dialysis and kidney transplantation have extended 
the  lives  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  patients  with  CKD  world-
wide. Clear indications for initiation of renal replacement therapy 
for  patients  with  CKD  include  anorexia  and  nausea  not  attribut-
able  to  reversible  causes  such  as  peptic  ulcer  disease,  evidence  of 
malnutrition,  and  fluid  and  electrolyte  abnormalities,  principally 
hyperkalemia or ECFV overload, that are refractory to other mea-
sures. Encephalopathy and pericarditis are very late complications, 
so it is now rare that they serve as indications for initiation of renal 
replacement therapy. 

Recommendations  for  the  Optimal  Time  for  Initiation  of  Renal 
Replacement Therapy  Because of the individual variability in the 
severity  of  uremic  symptoms  and  renal  function,  it  is  ill-advised 
to assign an arbitrary urea nitrogen or creatinine level to the need 
to  start  dialysis.  Moreover,  patients  may  become  accustomed  to 
chronic  uremia  and  deny  symptoms,  only  to  find  that  they  feel 
better with dialysis and realize in retrospect how poorly they were 
feeling before its initiation.

Previous studies suggested that starting dialysis before the onset 
of severe symptoms and signs of uremia was associated with pro-
longation of survival. This led to the concept of “healthy” start and 
is congruent with the philosophy that it is better to keep patients 
feeling  well  rather  than  allowing  them  to  become  ill  with  uremia 
and  then  attempting  to  return  them  to  better  health  with  dialysis 
or transplantation. Although recent studies have not confirmed an 
association  of  early-start  dialysis  with  improved  patient  survival, 
there may be merit in this approach for some patients. On a practi-
cal level, advanced preparation may help to avoid problems with the 
dialysis  process  itself  (e.g.,  a  poorly  functioning  fistula  for  hemo-
dialysis  or  malfunctioning  peritoneal  dialysis  catheter)  and,  thus, 
preempt  the  morbidity  associated  with  resorting  to  the  insertion 
of temporary hemodialysis access with its attendant risks of sepsis, 
bleeding, thrombosis, and association with accelerated mortality. 
Patient Education  Social, psychological, and physical preparation 
for  the  transition  to  renal  replacement  therapy  and  the  choice  of 
the optimal initial modality are best accomplished with a gradual 
approach  involving  a  multidisciplinary  team.  Along  with  conser-
vative measures discussed in the sections above, it is important to 
prepare  patients  with  an  intensive  educational  program,  explain-
ing  the  likelihood  and  timing  of  initiation  of  renal  replacement 
therapy and the various forms of therapy available and the option 
of  nondialytic  conservative  care.  The  more  knowledgeable  that 
patients are about hemodialysis (both in-center and home-based), 
peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation, the easier and more 
appropriate will be their decisions. Patients who are provided with 
education  are  more  likely  to  choose  home-based  dialysis  therapy. 
This approach is of societal benefit because home-based therapy is 
less expensive to most jurisdictions and is associated with improved 
quality of life. The educational programs should be commenced no 
later than stage 4 CKD so that the patient has sufficient time and 
cognitive function to learn the important concepts, make informed 

choices,  and  implement  preparatory  measures  for  renal  replace-
ment therapy.

Exploration of social support is also important. Early education 
of family members for selection and preparation of a home dialy-
sis  helper  or  a  biologically  or  emotionally  related  potential  living 
kidney donor should occur long before the onset of symptomatic 
renal failure.

Kidney  transplantation  (Chap.  313)  offers  the  best  potential 
for  complete  rehabilitation  because  dialysis  replaces  only  a  small 
fraction  of  the  kidneys’  filtration  function  and  none  of  the  other 
renal functions, including endocrine and anti-inflammatory effects. 
Generally, kidney transplantation follows a period of dialysis treat-
ment, although preemptive kidney transplantation (usually from a 
living donor) can be carried out if it is certain that the renal failure 
is irreversible.

 ■ IMPLICATIONS FOR GLOBAL HEALTH
In contrast to the natural decline and successful eradication of many 
devastating infectious diseases, there is rapid growth in the prevalence 
of  metabolic  and  vascular  disease  in  developing  countries.  Diabetes 
mellitus is becoming increasingly prevalent in these countries, perhaps 
due  in  part  to  change  in  dietary  habits,  diminished  physical  activity, 
and weight gain. Therefore, it follows that there will be a proportionate 
increase in vascular and renal disease. Health care agencies must plan 
for  improved  screening  of  high-risk  individuals  for  early  detection, 
prevention, and treatment plans in these nations and must start consid-
ering options for improved availability of renal replacement therapies.
There  is  also  increasing  recognition  of  endemic  nephropathies  in 
developing countries that particularly target young males working in 
agriculture.  The  extent  of  morbidity  and  mortality  associated  with 
these  nephropathies  is  only  starting  to  be  appreciated.  It  is  unclear 
what the cause is, but population genetic risk, endemic nephrotoxins, 
exposure to pesticides, NSAID use, and chronic volume depletion have 
all been suggested to contribute.

312 Dialysis in the Treatment  
of Kidney Failure
Kathleen D. Liu, Glenn M. Chertow

Dialysis may be required for the treatment of either acute or chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). The use of continuous renal replacement ther-
apies  (CRRTs)  and  prolonged  intermittent  renal  replacement  therapy 
(PIRRT)/slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) is specific to the manage-
ment of acute renal failure and is discussed in Chap. 310. These modal-
ities  are  performed  continuously  (CRRT)  or  over  6–12  h  per  session

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tract(PIRRT/SLED), in contrast to the 3–4 h of an intermittent hemodialysis 
session. Advantages and disadvantages of CRRT and PIRRT/SLED are 
discussed in Chap. 310.

Peritoneal dialysis is rarely used in developed countries for the treat-
ment  of  acute  renal  failure  because  of  the  increased  risk  of  infection 
and (as will be discussed in more detail below) less efficient clearance 
per unit of time. The focus of this chapter will be on the use of perito-
neal and hemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

With  the  widespread  availability  of  dialysis,  the  lives  of  hundreds 
of  thousands  of  patients  with  ESKD  have  been  prolonged.  In  the  
United  States  alone,  there  are  now  ~750,000  patients  with  treated 
ESKD  (kidney  failure  requiring  dialysis  or  transplantation),  the  vast 
majority of whom require dialysis. Since 2000, the prevalence of treated 
ESKD has increased 65%, which reflects both a small increase in the 
incidence rate and marginally enhanced survival of patients receiving 
dialysis. The crude incidence rate for treated ESKD in the United States 
is 370 cases per million population per year; ESKD is disproportion-
ately higher in African Americans as compared with white Americans. 
In  the  United  States,  the  leading  cause  of  ESKD  is  diabetes  mellitus, 
currently accounting for approximately 45% of newly diagnosed cases 
of  ESKD.  Approximately  30%  of  patients  have  ESKD  that  has  been 
attributed  to  hypertension,  although  it  is  unclear  whether  in  these 
cases  hypertension  is  the  cause  or  a  consequence  of  vascular  disease 
or  other  unknown  causes  of  kidney  failure.  Other  prevalent  causes 
of  ESKD  include  glomerulonephritis,  polycystic  kidney  disease,  and 
obstructive  uropathy.  A  fraction  of  the  excess  incidence  of  ESKD  in 
African Americans is likely related to transmission of high-risk alleles 
for the APOL1 gene.

Globally, mortality rates for patients with ESKD are lowest in Europe 
and Japan but very high in the developing world because of the limited 
availability of dialysis. In the United States, the mortality rate of patients 
on dialysis has decreased somewhat, but remains extremely high, with 
a  mortality  rate  of  167  per  1000  patient-years  for  patients  receiving 
hemodialysis and 156 per patient-years for patients receiving peritoneal 
dialysis.  Deaths  are  due  mainly  to  cardiovascular  diseases  and  infec-
tions. Older age, male sex, nonblack race, diabetes mellitus, malnutri-
tion, and underlying heart disease are important predictors of death.
TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS 
WITH ESKD
Commonly  accepted  criteria  for  initiating  patients  on  maintenance 
dialysis  include  the  presence  of  uremic  symptoms,  the  presence  of 
hyperkalemia unresponsive to conservative measures, persistent extra-
cellular volume expansion despite diuretic therapy, acidosis refractory 
to medical therapy, a bleeding diathesis, and a creatinine clearance or 
estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR)  <10  mL/min  per  1.73  m2 
(see Chap. 311 for estimating equations). Timely referral to a nephrol-
ogist for advanced planning and creation of a dialysis access, education 
about ESKD treatment options, and management of the complications 
of advanced CKD, including hypertension, anemia, acidosis, and sec-
ondary hyperparathyroidism, is advisable. Recent data have suggested 
that a sizable fraction of ESKD cases result following episodes of acute 
kidney  injury,  particularly  among  persons  with  underlying  CKD. 
Furthermore, there is no benefit to initiating dialysis preemptively at a 
GFR of 10–14 mL/min per 1.73 m2 compared to initiating dialysis for 
symptoms of uremia.

In  ESKD,  treatment  options  include  hemodialysis  (in-center  or  at 
home); peritoneal dialysis, as either continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
dialysis  (CAPD)  or  continuous  cyclic  peritoneal  dialysis  (CCPD);  or 
transplantation (Chap. 313). Although there are significant geographic 
variations and differences in practice patterns, in-center hemodialysis 
remains the most common therapeutic modality for ESKD (>85% of 
patients) in the United States. In contrast to hemodialysis, peritoneal 
dialysis is continuous, but much less efficient in terms of solute clear-
ance. While no large-scale clinical trials have been completed compar-
ing  outcomes  among  patients  randomized  to  either  hemodialysis  or 
peritoneal dialysis, outcomes associated with both therapies are similar 
in most reports, and the decision of which modality to select is often 
based on personal preferences and quality-of-life considerations.

HEMODIALYSIS
Hemodialysis  relies  on  the  principles  of  solute  diffusion  across  a 
semipermeable  membrane.  Movement  of  metabolic  waste  products 
takes  place  down  a  concentration  gradient  from  the  circulation  into 
the  dialysate.  The  rate  of  diffusive  transport  increases  in  response  to 
several factors, including the magnitude of the concentration gradient, 
the  membrane  surface  area,  and  the  mass  transfer  coefficient  of  the 
membrane. The latter is a function of the porosity and thickness of the 
membrane, the size of the solute molecule, and the conditions of flow 
on the two sides of the membrane. According to laws of diffusion, the 
larger the molecule, the slower its rate of transfer across the membrane. 
A small molecule, such as urea (60 Da), undergoes substantial clear-
ance, whereas a larger molecule, such as creatinine (113 Da), is cleared 
less efficiently. In addition to diffusive clearance, movement of waste 
products from the circulation into the dialysate may occur as a result 
of ultrafiltration. Convective clearance occurs because of solvent drag, 
with  solutes  being  swept  along  with  water  across  the  semipermeable 
dialysis membrane.

 ■ THE DIALYZER
There  are  three  essential  components  to  hemodialysis:  the  dialyzer, 
the composition and delivery of the dialysate, and the blood delivery 
system (Fig. 312-1). The dialyzer is a plastic chamber with the ability 
to  perfuse  blood  and  dialysate  compartments  simultaneously  at  very 
high flow rates. The hollow-fiber dialyzer is the most common in use in 
the United States. These dialyzers are composed of bundles of capillary 
tubes through which blood circulates while dialysate travels on the out-
side of the fiber bundle. Virtually all dialyzers now manufactured in the 
United States are “biocompatible” synthetic membranes derived from 
polysulfone or related compounds (vs older cellulose “bioincompatible” 
membranes that activated the complement cascade). The frequency of 
reprocessing and reuse of hemodialyzers and blood lines varies across 
the world. In general, as the cost of disposable supplies has decreased, 
their use has increased. In the United States, reprocessing of dialyzers is 
now extremely rare. Formaldehyde, peracetic acid–hydrogen peroxide, 
glutaraldehyde, and bleach have all been used as reprocessing agents.

 ■ DIALYSATE
The  potassium  concentration  of  dialysate  may  be  varied  from  
0–4  mmol/L  depending  on  the  predialysis  serum  potassium  concen-
tration.  The  use  of  0-  or  1-mmol/L  potassium  dialysate  is  becoming 
less  common  owing  to  data  suggesting  that  patients  who  undergo 
treatments with very low potassium dialysate have an increased risk of 
sudden death, perhaps due to arrhythmias in the setting of potassium 
shifts. The usual dialysate calcium concentration is 1.25 mmol/L (2.5 
mEq/L),  although  modification  may  be  required  in  selected  settings 
(e.g., higher dialysate calcium concentrations may be used in patients 
with  hypocalcemia  associated  with  secondary  hyperparathyroidism 
or  with  “hungry bone  syndrome”  following parathyroidectomy).  The 
usual dialysate sodium concentration is 136–140 mmol/L. In patients 
who frequently develop hypotension during their dialysis run, “sodium 
modeling”  to  counterbalance  urea-related  osmolar  gradients  may  be 
employed. With sodium modeling, the dialysate sodium concentration 
is  gradually  lowered  from  the  range  of  145–155  mmol/L  to  isotonic 
concentrations  (136–140  mmol/L)  near  the  end  of  the  dialysis  treat-
ment, typically declining either in steps or in a linear or exponential 
fashion. However, higher dialysate sodium concentrations and sodium 
modeling  may  predispose  patients  to  positive  sodium  balance  and 
increased  thirst;  thus,  these  strategies  to  ameliorate  intradialytic 
hypotension  may  be  undesirable  in  patients  with  hypertension  or  in 
patients  with  large  interdialytic  weight  gains.  Because  patients  are 
exposed to ~120 L of water during each dialysis treatment, water used 
for the dialysate is subjected to filtration, softening, deionization, and, 
ultimately, reverse osmosis to remove microbiologic contaminants and 
dissolved ions.

 ■ BLOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM
The  blood  delivery  system  is  composed  of  the  extracorporeal  circuit 
and the dialysis access. The dialysis machine consists of a blood pump,

dialysis  solution  delivery  system,  and  various  safety  monitors.  The 
blood  pump  moves  blood  from  the  access  site,  through  the  dialyzer, 
and  back  to  the  patient.  The  blood  flow  rate  typically  ranges  from 
250–450  mL/min,  depending  on  the  type  and  integrity  of  the  vas-
cular  access.  Negative  hydrostatic  pressure  on  the  dialysate  side  can 
be  manipulated  to  achieve  desirable  fluid  removal  or  ultrafiltration. 
Dialysis membranes have different ultrafiltration coefficients (i.e., mL 
removed/min per mmHg) so that along with hydrostatic changes, fluid 
removal  can  be  varied.  The  dialysis  solution  delivery  system  dilutes 
the  concentrated  dialysate  with  water  and  monitors  the  temperature, 
conductivity, and flow of dialysate.
 ■ DIALYSIS ACCESS
The  fistula,  graft,  or  catheter  through  which  blood  is  obtained  for 
hemodialysis is often referred to as a hemodialysis (or vascular) access. 
A native fistula created by the anastomosis of an artery to a vein (e.g., 
the Brescia-Cimino fistula, in which the cephalic vein is anastomosed 
end-to-side  to  the  radial  artery)  results  in  arterialization  of  the  vein. 
This  facilitates  its  subsequent  use  in  the  placement  of  large  needles 
(typically 15 gauge) to access the circulation. Fistulas have the highest 
long-term patency rate of all hemodialysis access options. For patients 
in whom fistulas fail to mature, or in patients whose vasculature does 
not  allow  creation  of  a  successful  fistula  (i.e.,  poor  arterial  inflow  or 
recipient  veins  of  inadequate  caliber),  patients  undergo  placement  of 
an  arteriovenous  graft  (i.e.,  the  interposition  of  prosthetic  material, 
usually  polytetrafluoroethylene,  between  an  artery  and  a  vein)  or  a 
tunneled  hemodialysis  catheter.  In  recent  years,  nephrologists,  vas-
cular  surgeons,  and  health  care  policy  makers  in  the  United  States 
have encouraged creation of arteriovenous fistulas in a larger fraction 
of  patients  (the  “fistula  first”  initiative).  Unfortunately,  even  when 
created, arteriovenous fistulas may not mature sufficiently to provide 
reliable access to the circulation, or they may thrombose early in their 
development.

The most important complication of arteriovenous grafts is throm-
bosis  of  the  graft  and  graft  failure,  due  principally  to  intimal  hyper-
plasia at the anastomosis between the graft and recipient vein. When 
grafts (or fistulas) fail, catheter-guided angioplasty can be used to dilate 

stenoses; monitoring of venous pressures on dialysis and of access flow, 
although not universally performed, may assist in the early recognition 
of impending vascular access failure. In addition to increased rates of 
access  failure,  grafts  and  (in  particular)  catheters  are  associated  with 
much higher rates of infection than fistulas.

Intravenous  large-bore  catheters  are  often  used  in  patients  with 
acute renal failure and CKD. For persons on maintenance hemodialy-
sis, tunneled catheters (either two separate catheters or a single catheter 
with two lumens) are often used when arteriovenous fistulas and grafts 
have failed or are not feasible due to anatomic considerations. These 
catheters  are  tunneled  under  the  skin;  the  tunnel  reduces  bacterial 
translocation  from  the  skin,  resulting  in  a  lower  infection  rate  than 
with  nontunneled  temporary  catheters.  Most  tunneled  catheters  are 
placed in the internal jugular veins; the external jugular, femoral, and 
subclavian veins may also be used. Infection, venous thrombosis, and 
venous stenosis resulting in swelling of the extremity or superior vena 
cava  syndrome  are  complications  best  avoided  by  limiting  the  time 
during which catheters are employed.

Nephrologists,  interventional  radiologists,  and  vascular  surgeons 
generally  prefer  to  avoid  placement  of  catheters  into  the  subclavian 
veins; while flow rates are usually excellent, subclavian stenosis is a fre-
quent complication and, if present, will likely prohibit permanent vas-
cular access (i.e., a fistula or graft) in the ipsilateral extremity. Infection 
rates may be higher with femoral catheters. For patients with multiple 
vascular  access  complications  and  no  other  options  for  permanent 
vascular access, tunneled catheters may be the last “lifeline” for hemo-
dialysis. Translumbar or transhepatic approaches into the inferior vena 
cava may be required if the superior vena cava or other central veins 
draining the upper extremities are stenosed or thrombosed.
 ■ GOALS OF DIALYSIS
The  hemodialysis  procedure  consists  of  pumping  heparinized  blood 
through the dialyzer at a flow rate of 250–450 mL/min, while dialysate 
flows in an opposite counter-current direction at 500–800 mL/min. The 
efficiency of dialysis is determined by blood and dialysate flow through 
the  dialyzer  as  well  as  dialyzer  characteristics  (i.e.,  its  efficiency  in 
removing solute). The dose of dialysis, which is currently defined as a

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractderivation  of  the  fractional  urea  clearance  during  a  single  treatment, 
is  further  governed  by  patient  size,  residual  kidney  function,  dietary 
protein intake, the degree of anabolism or catabolism, and the presence 
of comorbid conditions.

Since the landmark studies of Sargent and Gotch relating the mea-
surement of the dose of dialysis using urea concentrations with mor-
bidity  in  the  National  Cooperative  Dialysis  Study,  the  delivered  dose 
of  dialysis  has  been  measured  and  considered  as  a  quality  assurance 
and improvement tool. While the fractional removal of urea nitrogen 
and  derivations  thereof  are  considered  to  be  the  standard  methods 
by which “adequacy of dialysis” is measured, a large multicenter ran-
domized  clinical  trial  (the  HEMO  Study)  failed  to  show  a  difference 
in  mortality  associated  with  a  large  difference  in  per-session  urea 
clearance.  Current  targets  include  a  urea  reduction  ratio  (the  frac-
tional  reduction  in  blood  urea  nitrogen  per  hemodialysis  session)  of 
>65–70% and a body water–indexed clearance × time product (Kt/V) 
>1.2  or  1.05,  depending  on  whether  urea  concentrations  are  “equili-
brated.” For the majority of patients with ESKD, 9–12 h of dialysis are 
required each week, usually divided into three equal sessions. Several 
studies  have  suggested  that  longer  hemodialysis  session  lengths  may 
be beneficial (independent of urea clearance), although these studies 
are confounded by a variety of patient characteristics, including body 
size and nutritional status. Hemodialysis “dose” should be individual-
ized,  and  factors  other  than  the  urea  nitrogen  should  be  considered, 
including the adequacy of ultrafiltration or fluid removal and control 
of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and metabolic acidosis. A ran-
domized clinical trial comparing 6 versus 3 times per week hemodi-
alysis (the Frequent Hemodialysis Network Daily Trial) demonstrated 
improved  control  of  hypertension  and  hyperphosphatemia,  reduced 
left ventricular mass, and improved self-reported physical health with 
more  frequent  hemodialysis.  Secondary  analyses  also  demonstrated 
improvements in other metrics of health-related quality of life, includ-
ing  improved  self-reported  general  health  and  a  reduced  “time  to 
recovery” (time until usual activities can be resumed) among patients 
randomized  to  more  frequent  hemodialysis.  A  companion  trial  in 
which frequent nocturnal hemodialysis was compared to conventional 
hemodialysis at home showed no significant effect on left ventricular 
mass or self-reported physical health. Finally, an evaluation of the U.S. 
Renal Data System registry showed a significant increase in mortality 
and hospitalization for heart failure after the longer interdialytic inter-
val that occurs over the dialysis “weekend.”

 ■ COMPLICATIONS DURING HEMODIALYSIS
Hypotension  is  the  most  common  acute  complication  of  hemodial-
ysis,  particularly  among  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus.  Numerous 
factors appear to increase the risk of hypotension, including excessive 
ultrafiltration with inadequate compensatory vascular filling, impaired 
vasoactive or autonomic responses, osmolar shifts, overzealous use of 
antihypertensive agents, and reduced cardiac reserve. Patients with arte-
riovenous  fistulas  and  grafts  may  develop  high-output  cardiac  failure 
due to shunting of blood through the dialysis access; on rare occasions, 
this may necessitate ligation of the fistula or graft. The management of 
hypotension during dialysis consists of discontinuing ultrafiltration, the 
administration of 100–250 mL of isotonic saline, or administration of 
salt-poor albumin, although the latter is generally unavailable in outpa-
tient settings. Hypotension during dialysis can frequently be prevented 
by careful evaluation of the dry weight and by ultrafiltration modeling, 
such that more fluid is removed at the beginning rather than the end of 
the dialysis procedure. Excessively rapid fluid removal (>13 mL/kg per h)  
should  be  avoided,  as  rapid  fluid  removal  has  been  associated  with 
adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular deaths. Additional maneu-
vers  to  prevent  intradialytic  hypotension  include  the  performance  of 
sequential  ultrafiltration  followed  by  dialysis,  cooling  of  the  dialysate 
during  dialysis  treatment,  and  avoiding  heavy  meals  during  dialysis. 
Midodrine, an oral selective α1 adrenergic agent, has been advocated by 
some practitioners, although there is insufficient evidence of its safety 
and efficacy to support its routine use.

Muscle  cramps  during  dialysis  are  also  a  common  complication. 
The etiology of dialysis-associated cramps remains obscure. Changes

in  muscle  perfusion  because  of  excessively  rapid  volume  removal  or 
targeted removal below the patient’s estimated dry weight often precip-
itate dialysis-associated cramps. Strategies that may be used to prevent 
cramps  include  reducing  volume  removal  during  dialysis,  ultrafiltra-
tion profiling, and the use of sodium modeling (see above).

Anaphylactoid  reactions  to  the  dialyzer,  particularly  on  its  first 
use,  have  been  reported  most  frequently  with  the  bioincompatible  
cellulosic-containing  membranes.  Dialyzer  reactions  can  be  divided 
into  two  types,  A  and  B.  Type  A  reactions  are  attributed  to  an  IgE-
mediated intermediate hypersensitivity reaction to ethylene oxide used 
in the sterilization of new dialyzers. This reaction typically occurs soon 
after  the  initiation  of  a  treatment  (within  the  first  few  minutes)  and 
can progress to full-blown anaphylaxis if the therapy is not promptly 
discontinued. Treatment with steroids or epinephrine may be needed if 
symptoms are severe. The type B reaction consists of a symptom com-
plex of nonspecific chest and back pain, which appears to result from 
complement activation and cytokine release. These symptoms typically 
occur several minutes into the dialysis run and typically resolve over 
time with continued dialysis.

PERITONEAL DIALYSIS
In  peritoneal  dialysis,  1.5–3  L  of  a  dextrose-containing  solution  is 
infused into the peritoneal cavity and allowed to dwell for a set period 
of  time,  usually  2–4  h.  As  with  hemodialysis,  metabolic  by-products 
are removed through a combination of convective clearance generated 
through  ultrafiltration  and  diffusive  clearance  down  a  concentration 
gradient. The clearance of solutes and water during a peritoneal dialysis 
exchange depends on the balance between the movement of solute and 
water into the peritoneal cavity versus absorption from the peritoneal 
cavity. The rate of diffusion diminishes with time and eventually stops 
when equilibration between plasma and dialysate is reached. Absorp-
tion of solutes and water from the peritoneal cavity occurs across the 
peritoneal membrane into the peritoneal capillary circulation and via 
peritoneal lymphatics into the lymphatic circulation. The rate of perito-
neal solute transport varies from patient to patient and may be altered 
by  the  presence  of  infection  (peritonitis),  drugs,  and  physical  factors 
such as position and exercise.

 ■ FORMS OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS
Peritoneal dialysis may be carried out as CAPD, CCPD, or a combina-
tion of both. In CAPD, dialysate is manually infused into the peritoneal 
cavity and exchanged three to five times during the day. A nighttime 
dwell is frequently instilled at bedtime and remains in the peritoneal 
cavity  through  the  night.  In  CCPD,  exchanges  are  performed  in  an 
automated fashion, usually at night; the patient is connected to an auto-
mated cycler that performs a series of exchange cycles while the patient 
sleeps. The number of exchange cycles required to optimize peritoneal 
solute clearance varies by the peritoneal membrane characteristics; as 
with hemodialysis, solute clearance should be tracked to ensure dialysis 
“adequacy.”

Peritoneal dialysis solutions are available in volumes typically rang-
ing from 1.5–3 L. The major difference between the dialysate used for 
peritoneal rather than hemodialysis is that the hypertonicity of perito-
neal  dialysis  solutions  drives  solute  and  fluid  removal,  whereas  solute 
removal in hemodialysis depends on concentration gradients, and fluid 
removal requires transmembrane pressure. Typically, dextrose at vary-
ing concentrations contributes to the hypertonicity of peritoneal dial-
ysate. Icodextrin is a nonabsorbable carbohydrate that can be used in 
place of dextrose. Studies have demonstrated more efficient ultrafiltra-
tion with icodextrin than with dextrose-containing solutions. Icodextrin 
is typically used as the “last fill” for patients on CCPD or for the longest 
dwell in patients on CAPD. The most common additives to peritoneal 
dialysis  solutions  are  heparin  to  prevent  obstruction  of  the  dialysis 
catheter  lumen  with  fibrin  and  antibiotics  during  an  episode  of  acute 
peritonitis. Insulin may also be added in patients with diabetes mellitus.

 ■ ACCESS TO THE PERITONEAL CAVITY
Access to the peritoneal cavity is obtained through a peritoneal cath-
eter.  Catheters  used  for  maintenance  peritoneal  dialysis  are  flexible, 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2323

2324 being made of silicone rubber with numerous side holes at the distal 
end. These catheters usually have two Dacron cuffs. The scarring that 
occurs around the cuffs anchors the catheter and seals it from bacteria 
tracking  from  the  skin  surface  into  the  peritoneal  cavity;  it  also  pre-
vents the external leakage of fluid from the peritoneal cavity. The cuffs 
are placed in the preperitoneal plane and ~2 cm from the skin surface.
The peritoneal equilibrium test is a formal evaluation of peritoneal 
membrane characteristics that measures the transfer rates of creatinine 
and glucose across the peritoneal membrane. Patients are classified as 
low,  low–average,  high–average,  and  high  transporters.  Patients  with 
rapid equilibration (i.e., high transporters) tend to absorb more glucose 
and  lose  efficiency  of  ultrafiltration  with  long  daytime  dwells.  High 
transporters  also  tend  to  lose  larger  quantities  of  albumin  and  other 
proteins  across  the  peritoneal  membrane.  In  general,  patients  with 
rapid transporting characteristics require more frequent, shorter dwell-
time  exchanges,  nearly  always  obligating  use  of  a  cycler.  Slower  (low 
and low–average) transporters tend to do well with fewer exchanges. 
The efficiency of solute clearance also depends on the volume of dial-
ysate infused. Larger volumes allow for greater solute clearance, par-
ticularly  with  CAPD  in  patients  with  low  and  low–average  transport 
characteristics.

As  with  hemodialysis,  the  optimal  dose  of  peritoneal  dialysis  is 
unknown.  Several  observational  studies  have  suggested  that  higher 
rates  of  urea  and  creatinine  clearance  (the  latter  generally  measured 
in L/week) are associated with lower mortality rates and fewer uremic 
complications.  However,  a  randomized  clinical  trial  (Adequacy  of 
Peritoneal Dialysis in Mexico [ADEMEX]) failed to show a significant 
reduction  in  mortality  or  complications  with  a  relatively  large  incre-
ment in urea clearance. In general, patients on peritoneal dialysis do 
well when they retain residual kidney function. Rates of technique fail-
ure increase with years on dialysis and have been correlated with loss of 
residual function to a greater extent than loss of peritoneal membrane 
capacity.  For  some  patients  in  whom  CCPD  does  not  provide  suffi-
cient solute clearance, a hybrid approach can be adopted where one or 
more daytime exchanges are added to the CCPD regimen. While this 
approach can enhance solute clearance and prolong a patient’s capacity 
to remain on peritoneal dialysis, the burden of the hybrid approach can 
be overwhelming.

 ■ COMPLICATIONS DURING PERITONEAL DIALYSIS
The  major  complications  of  peritoneal  dialysis  are  peritonitis,  
catheter-associated  nonperitonitis  infections,  weight  gain  and  other 
metabolic disturbances, and residual uremia (especially among patients 
with little or no residual kidney function).

Peritonitis typically develops when there has been a break in sterile 
technique during one or more of the exchange procedures. Peritonitis 
is usually defined by an elevated peritoneal fluid leukocyte count (100/
mm3, of which at least 50% are polymorphonuclear neutrophils); these 
cutoffs  are  lower  than  in  spontaneous  bacterial  peritonitis  because 
of the presence of dextrose in peritoneal dialysis solutions and rapid 
bacterial  proliferation  in  this  environment  without  antibiotic  ther-
apy.  The  clinical  presentation  typically  consists  of  pain  and  cloudy 
dialysate,  often  with  fever  and  other  constitutional  symptoms.  The 
most  common  culprit  organisms  are  gram-positive  cocci,  including 
Staphylococcus, reflecting the origin from the skin. Gram-negative rod 
infections  are  less  common;  fungal  and  mycobacterial  infections  can 
be  seen  in  selected  patients,  particularly  after  antibacterial  therapy. 
Most  cases  of  peritonitis  can  be  managed  either  with  intraperitoneal 
or  oral  antibiotics,  depending  on  the  organism;  many  patients  with 
peritonitis do not require hospitalization. In cases where peritonitis is 
due to hydrophilic gram-negative rods (e.g., Pseudomonas sp.) or yeast, 
antimicrobial therapy is usually not sufficient, and catheter removal is 
required  to  ensure  complete  eradication  of  infection.  Nonperitonitis 
catheter-associated  infections  (often  termed  tunnel  infections)  vary 
widely in severity. Some cases can be managed with local antibiotic or 
silver nitrate administration, while others are severe enough to require 
parenteral antibiotic therapy and catheter removal.

Peritoneal dialysis is associated with a variety of metabolic compli-
cations. Albumin and other proteins can be lost across the peritoneal 

membrane  in  concert  with  the  loss  of  metabolic  wastes.  Hypopro-
teinemia obligates a higher dietary protein intake in order to maintain 
nitrogen  balance.  Hyperglycemia  and  weight  gain  are  also  common 
complications  of  peritoneal  dialysis.  Several  hundred  calories  in  the 
form  of  dextrose  are  absorbed  each  day,  depending  on  the  concen-
tration  of  dextrose  employed.  Patients  receiving  peritoneal  dialysis, 
particularly  those  with  diabetes  mellitus,  are  prone  to  other  compli-
cations  of  insulin  resistance,  including  hypertriglyceridemia.  On  the 
positive side, the continuous nature of peritoneal dialysis usually allows 
for  a  more  liberal  diet  due  to  continuous  removal  of  potassium  and  
phosphorus—two major dietary components whose accumulation can 
be hazardous in ESKD.

LONG-TERM OUTCOMES IN ESKD
Cardiovascular disease constitutes the major cause of death in patients 
with  ESKD.  Cardiovascular  mortality  and  event  rates  are  higher 
in  patients  receiving  dialysis  than  in  patients  posttransplantation, 
although  rates  are  extraordinarily  high  in  both  populations.  The 
underlying  cause  of  cardiovascular  disease  is  unclear  but  may  be 
related  to  shared  risk  factors  (e.g.,  diabetes  mellitus,  hypertension, 
atherosclerotic and arteriosclerotic vascular disease), chronic inflam-
mation, massive changes in extracellular volume (especially with high 
interdialytic  weight  gains),  inadequate  treatment  of  hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, anemia, dystrophic (vascular) calcification, and, perhaps, 
alterations  in  cardiovascular  dynamics  during  the  dialysis  treatment. 
Few  studies  have  targeted  cardiovascular  risk  reduction  in  patients 
with  ESKD;  none  has  demonstrated  consistent  benefit.  Two  clinical 
trials  of  statin  agents  in  ESKD  demonstrated  significant  reductions 
in  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL)  cholesterol  concentrations  but  no 
significant reductions in death or cardiovascular events (Die Deutsche 
Diabetes  Dialyse  Studie  [4D]  and  AURORA  studies).  The  Study  of 
Heart  and  Renal  Protection  (SHARP),  which  included  patients  on 
dialysis  and  others  with  non-dialysis-requiring  CKD,  showed  a  17% 
reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events or cardiovascular 
death with simvastatin-ezetimibe treatment. Most experts recommend 
conventional  cardioprotective  strategies  (e.g.,  lipid-lowering  agents, 
aspirin,  inhibitors  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system,  and 
β-adrenergic  antagonists)  in  patients  receiving  dialysis  based  on  the 
patients’ cardiovascular risk profile, which appears to be increased by 
more than an order of magnitude relative to persons unaffected by kid-
ney disease. Other complications of ESKD include a high incidence of 
infection, progressive debility and frailty, protein-energy malnutrition, 
and impaired cognitive function.

GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
The  incidence  of  ESKD  is  increasing  worldwide  with  longer  life  
expectancies and improved care of infectious and cardiovascular dis-
eases. The management of ESKD varies widely by country and within 
country by region, and it is influenced by economic and other major 
factors.  In  general,  peritoneal  dialysis  is  more  commonly  performed 
in  poorer  countries  owing  to  its  lower  expense  and  the  high  cost  of 
establishing in-center hemodialysis units.

313 Transplantation in the 

Treatment of Renal Failure
Jamil Azzi, Naoka Murakami, Anil Chandraker

Kidney  transplantation  is  the  treatment  of  choice  for  patients  with 
end-stage  kidney  disease  (ESKD).  Worldwide,  tens  of  thousands  of 
kidney  transplants  have  been  performed,  and  >220,000  patients  are 
living with a functioning kidney transplant in the United States today. 
The first successful kidney transplant was performed in Boston in 1954 
between identical twins without the need of immunosuppression. The 
introduction of immunosuppressive therapies such as azathioprine and 
prednisone in the 1960s established kidney transplantation across non-
identical  individuals  (allografts).  However,  the  results  with  properly 
matched familial donors remained significantly superior to those with 
organs from deceased donors. During the 1970s and 1980s, the success 
rate at the 1-year mark for deceased-donor allografts rose progressively 
after the introduction of calcineurin inhibitors. Currently, 1-year sur-
vival rates for living-donor and deceased-donor allografts are 98% and 
93%,  respectively,  in  the  United  States.  However,  long-term  survival 
has  not  improved  as  much  over  time,  and  average  allograft  survival 
times are 14 and 10 years for living-donor and deceased-donor grafts, 
respectively.

Age-related mortality rates after transplantation are highest in the 
first year due to the surgical risks: 2% for ages 18–34 years, 3% for ages 
35–49 years, and 6.8% for ages ≥50–60 years. Despite these outcome 
statistics,  the  actual  survival  benefit  of  transplantation  compared  to 
chronic  dialysis  becomes  apparent  within  days  to  months  following 
transplantation,  even  after  risk  adjustments  for  age,  diabetes,  and 
cardiovascular status. While the loss of kidney transplant due to acute 
rejection  is  now  a  rare  event,  most  allografts  eventually  succumb  at 
varying  rates  to  a  chronic  process  consisting  of  interstitial  fibrosis, 
tubular  atrophy,  vasculopathy,  and  glomerulopathy,  the  pathogenesis 
of which in varying degrees is likely a combination of an alloimmune 
response, drug toxicity, and the end result of a variety of other insults. 
Overall, transplantation results in an improved life expectancy with a 
higher quality of life compared to patients whom remain on dialysis.

RECENT ACTIVITY AND RESULTS
In  2019,  >16,000  deceased-donor  kidney  transplants  and  6800 
living-donor  transplants  were  performed  in  the  United  States,  with 
the  ratio  of  deceased-donor  to  living-donor  transplants  remaining 
stable over the past few years. As the number of patients with ESKD 
increases,  the  number  of  patients  on  the  transplant  waitlist  also 
increases,  and  the  donor  shortage  remains  a  critical  challenge.  As  of 
2019, there were nearly 59,000 active adult candidates on the waiting 
list, with <23,000 patients being transplanted yearly. This imbalance is 
set to worsen over the coming years with the predicted increased rates 
of kidney failure associated with obesity and diabetes worldwide. In an 
attempt to increase utilization of marginal kidneys and allocate organs

TABLE 313-1  Definition of a Non-Heart-Beating Donor (Donation 
After Cardiac Deatha [DCD])

II: Unsuccessful resuscitation
III: Awaiting cardiac arrest
IV: Cardiac arrest after brainstem death
V: Cardiac arrest in a hospital patient

aKidneys can be used for transplantation from categories II–V but are commonly 
only used from categories III and IV. The survival of these kidneys has not been 
shown to be inferior to that of deceased-donor kidneys.
Note: Kidneys can both have a Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) score >85% and 
be DCD. High KDPI kidneys have been shown to have a poorer survival, and there 
is a separate shorter waiting list for those kidneys. They are generally utilized 
for patients for whom the benefits of being transplanted earlier outweigh the 
associated risks of using a lower-quality kidney.

equitably, a new allocation system within the United States was imple-
mented in 2014. The guiding principles of the changes were to offer an 
opportunity for transplantation to patients who were highly sensitized 
and, thus, less likely to find a suitable donor, while at the same time to 
allow patients expected to survive the longest to receive the best-quality 
deceased donor organs. The Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) score, 
which ranges from 0 to 100%, was introduced to estimate the potential 
risk of graft failure after kidney transplant based on 10 donor factors. 
The lower KDPI values are associated with higher expected posttrans-
plant survival. Hence, the kidneys with a KDPI <20% are allocated to 
the 20% of the potential recipients with the highest expected posttrans-
plant survival. Kidneys with a KDPI >85% (previously called expanded 
criteria  donor  [ECD]  kidneys)  are  directed  toward  patients  who  are 
expected  to  fare  less  well  on  dialysis  and  would  benefit  from  being 
transplanted earlier even if it means accepting a lower-quality organ. A 
variety of other means to increase the donor pool and equity in terms 
of wait time for a transplant have also become more popular. Kidneys 
from donors after cardiac death (DCD) are being increasingly used to 
overcome  the  demand  for  organs  (Table  313-1).  Furthermore,  with 
the  advancement  of  the  direct-acting  antiviral  therapies  for  hepatitis 
C  virus  (HCV),  transplantation  from  HCV-positive  donors  to  HCV- 
positive or -negative recipients has been performed since 2017 in order 
to increase the donor pool. Now this practice is incorporated in several 
centers in the United States. Recently, the HOPE (Human Immunode-
ficiency Virus [HIV] Organ Policy Equity) Act authorized organ dona-
tion  from  HIV-positive  candidates,  and  >100  transplants  have  been 
performed. Finally, in the new kidney allocation system, B blood type 
candidates who have low anti-A titer are eligible for an allograft from 
A blood type donors. This helps improve access and reduce disparities 
in wait time for minorities, especially for the African-American ESKD 
population,  in  whom  blood  type  B  is  more  common  than  in  other 
ethnicities.

The overall results of transplantation are presented in Table 313-2. At 
the 1-year mark, allograft survival is higher for living-donor recipients. 
This  is  most  likely  related  to  decreased  damage  of  the  organ  related 
to less ischemic injury. The introduction of more effective drugs and 
more  sensitive  matching  between  recipients  and  donors  has  almost 
equalized the risk of graft rejection in the majority of patients within 
the  first  year.  At  5-  and  10-year  follow-up,  however,  there  remains  a 
steeper decline in survival of those with deceased-donor kidneys.

RECIPIENT EVALUATION
Virtually  all  patients  with  ESKD  benefit  from  transplantation  with  a 
longer life expectancy and a better quality of life. While the mortality 
rate after transplantation is highest in the first year due to perioperative 
complications, recipient evaluation is critical in identifying patients at 
risk.  It  involves  a  multidisciplinary  approach  that  requires  thorough 
medical, surgical, social, and psychosocial evaluations to identify the 
risk factors that prohibit transplantation or mandate treatment before 
proceeding, as well as ensuring the appropriate use of limited organs.
There  are  a  few  absolute  contraindications  to  kidney  transplanta-
tion:  chronic  illness  that  limits  predicted  survival  for  <2  years,  active

malignancy, active infection, psychosocial issues affecting adherence to 
the medical care, and active substance abuse. Another critically impor-
tant  factor  to  consider  is  cardiovascular  risk  during  both  the  periop-
erative  and  postoperative  periods.  Patients  with  ESKD  are  at  higher 
cardiovascular  mortality  risk,  and  thorough  cardiovascular  evaluation 
for coronary artery diseases, valvular diseases, and heart failure is critical.
At most centers, there is no official age limit for transplantation, with 
>20% of waitlisted candidates currently being older than 65. However, 
overall physical and cognitive function of the candidates needs to be fully 
assessed. While history of malignancy itself is not a contraindication for 
kidney transplantation, potential recipients should be treated and cured 
with a waiting time of 2–5 years depending on the type of malignancy to 
decrease the risk of recurrence of the disease. Latent or indolent infec-
tion (HIV, hepatitis B or C, tuberculosis) should be a routine part of the 
candidate workup. While historically transplant centers considered overt 
AIDS and active hepatitis absolute contraindications to transplantation 
because of the high risk of opportunistic infection, with the introduction 
of potent antiviral regimens, many centers are now transplanting indi-
viduals with hepatitis and HIV infection under strict protocols.

One of the few “immunologic” contraindications to transplantation 
is the presence of antibodies against the donor kidney at the time of 
the anticipated transplant that can cause hyperacute rejection. Those 
harmful antibodies include natural antibodies against the ABO blood 
group antigens and antibodies against human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
class I (A, B, C) or class II (DR, DQ, DP) antigens. These antibodies 
are  routinely  excluded  by  proper  screening  of  the  candidate’s  ABO 
compatibility and direct cytotoxic cross-matching of candidate serum 
with lymphocytes of the donor. Removal of these antibodies directed 
at donor tissue through a variety of strategies (desensitization) is now 
routinely performed with varying levels of success.

TISSUE TYPING AND CLINICAL 
IMMUNOGENETICS
Matching  for  antigens  of  the  HLA  major  histocompatibility  complex 
(Chap. 350) is an important criterion for the selection of donors. Each 
mammalian  species  has  a  single  chromosomal  region  that  encodes 
the strong, or major, transplantation antigens, and this region on the 
human chromosome 6 codes the HLA genes. HLA is highly polymor-
phic;  therefore,  it  can  be  an  immunologic  target  of  organ  rejection 
when  mismatched  between  the  donor  and  the  recipient.  Historically, 
HLA  antigens  have  been  defined  by  serologic  techniques  by  adding 
sera  of  a  recipient  (potentially  containing  anti-HLA  antibodies)  with 
a  “library”  of  leukocytes  with  known  serotypes.  However,  currently, 
molecular typing of HLA by genomic sequencing is almost universally 
used. Other “minor,” non-HLA antigens may also elicit an alloimmune 
response in addition to the ABH(O) antigens and endothelial antigens 
that are not expressed on lymphocytes. The number of HLA antigen 
mismatches in A, B, and DR loci correlates with allograft survival; the 
more mismatches, the higher is the risk of allograft rejection. Never-
theless, some HLA-identical renal allografts are rejected, often within 
the first few weeks after transplantation. These failures may represent 
states  of  prior  sensitization  to  non-HLA  antigens.  Non-HLA  minor 
antigens are relatively weak when initially encountered and are, there-
fore, suppressible by conventional immunosuppressive therapy. If prior 
exposure to the antigen and priming of the recipient immune system 
has occurred, secondary exposure at the time of transplantation may 
lead to an immune response refractory to treatment.

DONOR EVALUATION
 ■ LIVING-DONOR EVALUATION
Living kidney donors experience the immediate risk of surgery and the 
long-term potential risk of developing kidney dysfunction prematurely; 
thus, the basic principle of “first, do no harm” (Chap. 11) is important. 
Therefore, donor evaluation must take every effort to exclude any med-
ical  conditions  that  may  cause  morbidity  and  mortality  after  kidney 
donation, such as hypertension, diabetes, and/or proteinuria. Although 
studies have shown that the risk of ESKD after kidney donation is not 
greater  than  that  of  the  general  population,  donation  is  associated 
with a small but significant potential lifetime risk of ESKD (0.3–0.4%; 
absolute risk increased by 0.2–0.3% compared to that of healthy non-
donors).  The  mechanism  of  premature  renal  failure  is  thought  to  be 
due to increased blood flow and hyperfiltration injury in the remaining 
kidney.  There  are  a  few  reports  of  the  development  of  hypertension, 
proteinuria,  and  even  lesions  of  focal  segmental  sclerosis  in  donors 
over long-term follow-up. In family members of type 1 diabetics, anti-
insulin and anti-islet cell antibodies should be measured, and a glucose 
tolerance test should be performed. African-American donors have a 
higher  risk  of  ESKD  after  donation  (in  line  with  their  higher  risk  of 
kidney  failure  in  general),  and  the  genetic  screening  for  APOL1  risk 
alleles may be appropriate (Chap. 314). From the surgical perspective, 
selective renal arteriography is essential to reveal any anatomic anom-
aly  and  to  assess  the  size  imbalance  and  laterality  of  donor  kidneys. 
In  most  cases,  donor  nephrectomy  is  performed  laparoscopically  to 
minimize the surgical scar and to enhance a faster postsurgical recov-
ery.  Lastly,  although  financial  and  nonfinancial  conflicts  of  interest 
between kidney donors and recipients are strictly prohibited, removing 
financial  disincentives  is  increasingly  accepted  as  a  means  to  reduce 
barriers toward living donation (Chap. 11).

 ■ DECEASED-DONOR EVALUATION
Deceased  donors  should  be  free  of  malignant  neoplastic  disease, 
hepatitis,  and  HIV  owing  to  possible  transmission  to  the  recipient, 
although under certain circumstances, HCV- and HIV-positive organs 
may  be  used.  Increased  risk  of  graft  failure  exists  when  the  donor  is 
elderly  or  has  acute  kidney  injury  or  when  the  kidney  experiences  a 
prolonged period of ischemia.

In the United States, there is a national system of regulations, alloca-
tion support, and outcomes analysis for kidney transplantation called 
the Organ Procurement Transplant Network. Studies have shown that 
it is possible to remove deceased-donor kidneys and maintain them for 
up to 48 h on cold pulsatile perfusion or with simple flushing and cool-
ing, but these practices are not part of clinical care as of yet. Generally, 
an ischemic time of <24 h is preferred; this approach permits adequate 
time for typing, cross-matching, transportation, and selection issues to 
be resolved.

 ■ PRESENSITIZATION
The  presence  of  antibodies  against  donor  antigens,  either  HLA  or 
non-HLA, can be a potential cause of allograft injury following trans-
plantation, and hence, it is important to carry out cross-matching prior 
to transplantation. For the purposes of cross-matching, donor T lym-
phocytes, which express class I but not class II HLA, are used as a sur-
rogate target for detection of circulating anti–class I (HLA-A and -B) 
antibodies in the recipient. Note that T cells are used as surrogate cells

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tract 
for the detection of class I HLA as a matter of convenience and this is 
unrelated to the risk of T cell–mediated rejection. A positive cytotoxic 
cross-match  of  recipient  serum  with  donor  T  lymphocytes  indicates 
the presence of preformed donor-specific anti-HLA class I antibodies 
and is usually predictive of an acute vasculitic event termed hyperacute 
rejection.  This  finding  represents  the  only  widely  accepted  absolute 
immunologic contraindication for kidney transplantation. Recently, an 
increasing number of tissue-typing laboratories have shifted to a more 
sensitive flow cytometric–based cross-match assay, which detects the 
presence of anti-HLA antibodies that are not necessarily detected on 
a  cytotoxic  cross-match  assay  and  may  not  be  an  absolute  contrain-
dication  to  transplantation.  The  known  sources  of  sensitization  are 
blood transfusion, a prior transplant, pregnancy, and, less commonly, 
vaccination/infection.

Preformed anti–class II (HLA-DR and -DQ) antibodies against the 
donor  also  carry  a  higher  risk  of  graft  loss,  particularly  in  recipients 
who have suffered early loss of a prior kidney transplant. B lympho-
cytes  (again,  used  for  convenience),  which  express  both  class  I  and 
class II HLA, are used as a surrogate target in these assays. Some non- 
HLA antigens restricted in expression to endothelium and monocytes 
have been described, but their clinical relevance is not well established. 
A series of minor histocompatibility antigens do not elicit antibodies, 
and  sensitization  to  these  antigens  is  detectable  only  by  cytotoxic 
T cells, an assay too cumbersome for routine use.

Desensitization prior to transplantation by reducing the level of anti-
donor antibodies utilizing plasmapheresis and/or the administration of 
pooled immunoglobulin (IV immunoglobulin [IVIG]) has been useful 
in reducing the risk of hyperacute rejection following transplantation.

IMMUNOLOGY OF REJECTION
Both T cell–mediated and antibody-mediated effector mechanisms can 
play roles in kidney transplant rejection.

T  cell–mediated  rejection  is  caused  by  recipient  T  lymphocytes 
that  respond  to  donor  HLA  antigens  expressed  on  the  organ.  CD4+ 
lymphocytes  respond  to  class  II  (HLA-DR)  incompatibility  by  pro-
liferating  and  releasing  proinflammatory  cytokines  that  augment  the 
proliferative response of the immune system. CD8+ cytotoxic lympho-
cytes  respond  primarily  to  class  I  (HLA-A,  -B)  antigens  and  mature 
into  cytotoxic  effector  cells  that  cause  organ  damage  through  direct 
contact  and  lysis  of  donor  target  cells.  Full  T-cell  activation  requires 
not only T-cell receptor binding to the alloantigens presented by self 
or donor HLA molecules (known as indirect and direct presentation, 
respectively), but also engagement of costimulatory molecules such as 
CD28 on T cells and CD80 and CD86 ligands on antigen-presenting 
cells  (Fig.  313-1).  Signaling  through  both  of  these  pathways  induces 
activation  of  the  kinase  activity  of  calcineurin,  which,  in  turn,  acti-
vates  transcription  factors  leading  to  upregulation  of  multiple  genes, 
including interleukin (IL) 2 and interferon γ. IL-2 signals through the 
target of rapamycin (TOR) to induce cell proliferation in an autocrine 
fashion. There is evidence that non-HLA antigens can also play a role 
in renal transplant rejection episodes. Recipients who receive a kidney 
from  an  HLA-identical  sibling  can  still  have  rejection  episodes  and 
require maintenance immunosuppression, whereas true identical twin 
transplants  require  no  immunosuppression.  There  are  documented 
non-HLA antigens, such as an endothelial-specific antigen system with 
limited polymorphism and a tubular antigen, which can act as targets 
of humoral or cellular rejection responses, respectively.

Antibody-mediated  rejection  is  caused  by  circulating  antibodies 
against donor antigens. After transplantation, donor-derived antigens 
are delivered to the recipient’s draining lymph nodes and activate an 
alloimmune response. A subset of CD4+ T cells called follicular helper 
T cells (Tfh) are activated and promote differentiation of B cells into 
antibody-secreting plasma cells. Plasma cells produce donor-targeting 
antibodies  against  HLA  and  non-HLA  antigens,  which  can  deposit 
in  allograft  kidney  and  cause  injury  via  complement-dependent  and 
independent  mechanisms.  C4d  deposition  in  peritubular  capillaries 
and glomerular basement membrane is a footprint of complement acti-
vation and is one of the diagnostic criteria of antibody-mediated rejec-
tion, together with the presence of circulating donor-specific antibody.

FIGURE 313-1  Recognition pathways for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
antigens.  Graft  rejection  is  initiated  by  CD4  helper  T  lymphocytes  (TH)  having 
antigen  receptors  that  bind  to  specific  complexes  of  peptides  and  MHC  class  II 
molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APC). In transplantation, in contrast to other 
immunologic responses, there are two sets of T-cell clones involved in rejection. 
In the direct pathway, the class II MHC of donor allogeneic APCs is recognized by 
CD4 TH cells that bind to the intact MHC molecule, and class I MHC allogeneic cells 
are recognized by CD8 T cells. The latter generally proliferate into cytotoxic cells 
(TC). In the indirect pathway, the incompatible MHC molecules are processed into 
peptides that are presented by the self-APCs of the recipient. The indirect, but not 
the direct, pathway is the normal physiologic process in T-cell recognition of foreign 
antigens. Once TH cells are activated, they proliferate and, by secretion of cytokines 
and direct contact, exert strong helper effects on macrophages, TC, and B cells.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE TREATMENT
Kidney  transplant  recipients  need  to  take  immunosuppressive  drugs 
for  life,  except  identical  twins  and  simultaneous  bone  marrow–kidney 
transplant  recipients.  Immunosuppressive  therapy,  as  currently  avail-
able, suppresses all immune responses nonspecifically, including those 
to bacteria, fungi, and even malignant tumors. In general, all clinically 
available drugs are more selective to primary rather than to memory 
immune  responses.  Agents  to  suppress  the  immune  response  are 
divided  into  induction  and  maintenance  agents.  Those  currently  in 
clinical use are listed in Table 313-3.
 ■ INDUCTION THERAPY
Induction therapy is given to most kidney transplant recipients in the 
United States at the time of transplant to reduce the risk of early acute 
rejection  and  to  minimize  or  eliminate  the  use  of  either  steroids  or 
calcineurin  inhibitors  and  their  associated  toxicities.  Induction  ther-
apy consists of antibodies that could be monoclonal or polyclonal and 
depleting or nondepleting.
Depleting  Agents  Antithymocyte  globulin  (ATG)  is  a  lymphocyte- 
depleting agent. Peripheral human lymphocytes, thymocytes, or lym-
phocytes from spleens or thoracic duct fistulas are injected into horses 
or rabbits to produce antilymphocyte serum, from which the immu-
noglobulin  fraction  is  then  separated.  Those  polyclonal  antibodies 
induce lymphocyte depletion, and the immune system may take several 
months, if not years, to fully recover.

Monoclonal  antibodies  against  defined  lymphocyte  subsets  offer 
a  more  precise  and  standardized  form  of  therapy.  Alemtuzumab  is

directed  to  CD52,  widely  expressed  on  immune  cells  such  as  B  and  
T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, and some granulocytes.

Nondepleting Agents  Another more selective approach is to tar-
get the 55-kDa alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor, which is expressed only 
on activated T cells. This approach is used as prophylaxis for (but not 
treatment of) acute rejection in the immediate posttransplant period 
and  is  effective  at  decreasing  the  early  acute  rejection  rate  with  few 
adverse side effects.

 ■ MAINTENANCE THERAPY
The most frequently used combination is a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), 
usually tacrolimus, and an antimetabolite, usually mycophenolic acid, 
with  or  without  early  steroid  withdrawal.  More  recently,  the  U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new costimulatory 
blocking antibody, belatacept, as a new strategy to prevent long-term 
CNI toxicity. The mTOR inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus are infre-
quently used as first-line maintenance immunosuppression.

Antimetabolites  Azathioprine is a prodrug that must first be acti-
vated to form thioguanine nucleotides. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase  
(TPMT)  inactivates  azathioprine.  Patients  with  two  nonfunctional 
TPMT  alleles  experience  life-threatening  myelosuppression  when 
treated  with  azathioprine,  and  those  who  carry  one  nonfunctional 
TPMT allele may also have significant side effects; therefore, the FDA 
recommends TPMT genotyping or phenotyping before starting treat-
ment with azathioprine. Azathioprine, which inhibits synthesis of DNA 
and RNA and thereby inhibits T-cell proliferation, was the keystone of 
immunosuppressive  therapy  in  kidney  transplant  recipients  until  the 
1990s  but  has  been  replaced  by  more  effective  agents.  Concomitant 
use of allopurinol should be avoided, owing to inhibition of xanthine 
oxidase.

Mycophenolate  mofetil  and  mycophenolate  sodium,  both  of  which 
are metabolized to mycophenolic acid, are now used in place of aza-
thioprine based on superior efficacy. Mycophenolic acid has a similar 
mode of action as azathioprine and is associated with a mild degree of 
gastrointestinal toxicity but less bone marrow suppression.

Steroids  Glucocorticoids  are  important  adjuncts  to  immunosup-
pressive therapy and used as both induction and maintenance therapy. 
In  general,  methylprednisolone  250–500  mg  is  given  immediately 
before or at the time of transplantation, and the dose is tapered to 20 mg  
within  a  week.  The  side  effects  of  the  glucocorticoids,  particularly 
impairment  of  wound  healing  and  predisposition  to  infection,  make 
it  desirable  to  taper  the  dose  as  rapidly  as  possible  in  the  immediate 
postoperative  period.  Early  discontinuation  or  avoidance  of  steroids 
is  common  to  avoid  long-term  adverse  effects  on  bone,  skin,  and 

glucose metabolism. Most patients whose renal function is stable after 
6 months or a year do not require large doses of prednisone; mainte-
nance doses of 5–10 mg per day are the rule. A major effect of steroids 
is preventing the release of IL-6 and IL-1 by monocytes-macrophages.

Calcineurin  Inhibitors  Cyclosporine  is  a  fungal  peptide  with 
potent immunosuppressive activity. It acts on the calcineurin pathway 
to inhibit transcription of IL-2 and other proinflammatory cytokines, 
thereby  inhibiting  T-cell  proliferation.  It  works  synergistically  with 
glucocorticoids  and  mycophenolate.  Among  its  toxic  effects  (neph-
rotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, hirsutism, tremor, gingival hyperplasia, and 
diabetes), nephrotoxicity presents a serious management problem and 
is further discussed below.

Tacrolimus (FK506) is a fungal macrolide that has the same mode 
of action as cyclosporine as well as a similar side effect profile; it does 
not, however, produce hirsutism or gingival hyperplasia; in contrast, it 
can be associated with hair loss. De novo diabetes mellitus following 
transplantation more commonly occurs with tacrolimus. An extended- 
release  formulation  of  tacrolimus  is  now  available  and  is  given  once 
daily. Owing to its nephrotoxicity and narrow therapeutic window, the 
drug level of CNIs should be monitored, and drug–drug interactions 
should  be  carefully  examined.  Antibiotics  and  antifungals  (e.g.,  ery-
thromycin,  ketoconazole,  fluconazole)  and  nondihydropyridine  cal-
cium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil) inhibit the activity of 
cytochrome P450 C3A enzyme and cause elevated levels of CNIs. On 
the other hand, antiepileptics, such as phenytoin and carbamazepine, 
increase metabolism, resulting in lower levels.

mTOR  Inhibitors  Sirolimus  (previously  called  rapamycin)  is 
another  fungal  macrolide  but  has  a  different  mode  of  action  from 
tacrolimus; i.e., it inhibits T-cell growth factor signaling pathways, pre-
venting the response to IL-2 and other cytokines. Sirolimus can be used 
in conjunction with cyclosporine or tacrolimus, or with mycophenolic 
acid, to avoid the use of CNIs.

Everolimus  is  another  mTOR  inhibitor  with  similar  mechanism  of 
action as sirolimus but with better bioavailability. mTOR inhibitors are 
modestly tolerated and are associated with gastrointestinal disturbance, 
stomatitis, mucositis, and pneumonitis. Poor wound healing associated 
with  mTOR  inhibitors  makes  them  less  preferable  agents  during  the 
perisurgical  period.  While  the  PI3K-mTOR  is  the  most  commonly 
mutated  cellular  pathway  in  malignant  cells,  mTOR  inhibitors  have 
been used more frequently in transplant patients who develop cancers, 
in particular recurrent skin cancers.

Belatacept  Belatacept is a fusion protein composed of the Fc frag-
ment of human IgG1 immunoglobulin and the extracellular domain of 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). It binds to its 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2328

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractcostimulatory ligands (CD80 and CD86) on antigen-presenting cells, 
interrupting  their  binding  to  CD28  on  T  cells.  This  inhibition  leads 
to T-cell anergy and apoptosis. Belatacept is FDA approved for kidney 
transplant recipients and is given monthly as an intravenous infusion. 
The  7-year  follow-up  of  the  Belatacept  Evaluation  of  Nephroprotec-
tion and Efficacy as First-Line Immunosuppression Trial (BENEFIT) 
showed improved patient and graft survival for the belatacept-treated 
group  compared  to  patients  treated  with  cyclosporine,  despite  short-
term risks of higher rates of acute rejection.

CLINICAL COURSE AND MANAGEMENT OF 
THE RECIPIENT
Adequate  hemodialysis  should  be  performed  within  48  h  of  surgery 
as needed to control serum potassium to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. 
During  the  transplantation  surgery,  the  kidney  allograft  is  usually 
placed  in  recipient’s  iliac  fossa  using  a  retroperitoneal  approach.  An 
anastomosis is made between donor renal artery and recipient exter-
nal  iliac  artery,  and  donor  renal  vein  to  recipient  external  iliac  vein. 
The  donor  ureter  is  anastomosed  to  the  recipient  bladder  mucosa. 
Native kidney nephrectomy is rarely performed except in the case of 
an extremely enlarged polycystic kidney or chronic pyelonephritis. In 
many cases, especially after living kidney transplantation, the allograft 
starts  to  produce  urine  immediately  after  anastomosis.  The  allograft 

often has some degree of acute tubular injury due to ischemia, which 
accounts for postoperative diuresis. Large amounts of sodium, potas-
sium,  and  water  may  be  lost  postoperatively,  which  requires  close 
monitoring and replacement. The recipient’s serum creatinine should 
start  to  fall  as  the  allograft  starts  to  function,  and  recovery  usually 
occurs within 2 weeks, although periods as long as 6 weeks have been 
reported. Slow recovery or oliguria should prompt an allograft biopsy, 
because superimposition of rejection on acute tubular injury is com-
mon and difficult to distinguish without an allograft biopsy. Induction 
immunosuppression therapy and maintenance steroids and antimetab-
olites start on the day of surgery, and it is usually safe to delay intro-
duction of a CNI for a few days if a lymphocyte-depleting induction 
agent is used. Figure 313-2 illustrates a typical algorithm followed by 
transplant centers for early posttransplant management of recipients at 
high or low risk of early renal dysfunction.

 ■ MANAGEMENT OF REJECTION
Early  diagnosis  of  rejection  allows  prompt  institution  of  therapy  to 
preserve  renal  function  and  prevent  irreversible  damage.  Clinical 
evidence  of  rejection  is  rarely  characterized  by  fever,  swelling,  and 
tenderness  over  the  allograft.  Rejection  may  present  only  with  a  rise 
in serum creatinine, with or without a reduction in urine volume. The 
focus should be on ruling out other causes of functional deterioration,

FIGURE 313-2  A typical algorithm for early posttransplant care of a kidney recipient. If any of the recipient or donor “high-risk” factors exist, more aggressive management 
is called for. Low-risk patients can be treated with a standard immunosuppressive regimen with no or less-potent induction therapy (e.g., basiliximab). Patients at higher 
risk of rejection or early ischemic transplant dysfunction are often induced with an antithymocyte globulin to provide more potent early immunosuppression or to spare 
calcineurin use in the immediate posttransplant period. *When there is early transplant dysfunction, prerenal, obstructive, and vascular causes must be ruled out by 
ultrasonographic examination. The panel reactive antibody (PRA) is a quantitation of how much antibody is present in a candidate against a panel of cells representing the

2330 such as acute tubular injury, calcineurin toxicity, BK nephropathy, and 

recurrent glomerular diseases.

Doppler  ultrasonography  is  useful  in  ascertaining  changes  in  the 
renal vasculature and in renal blood flow. Thrombosis of the renal vein 
occurs  rarely;  it  may  be  reversible  if  it  is  caused  by  technical  factors 
and  intervention  is  prompt.  Diagnostic  ultrasound  is  also  helpful  in 
identifying urinary obstruction or the presence of perirenal collections 
of urine (urinoma), blood (hematoma), or lymph (lymphocele).

Allograft biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of acute T cell–
mediated  and  antibody-mediated  rejection.  Acute  T  cell–mediated 
rejection is diagnosed by the presence of immune cell infiltration in the 
interstitial, tubular, or vascular compartments, according to the Banff 
classification. Treatment of T cell–mediated rejection involves a high-dose 
steroid, e.g., IV administration of methylprednisolone, 500–1000 mg daily 
for  3  days.  Failure  to  respond  is  an  indication  for  antibody  therapy, 
usually with ATG.

Evidence of antibody-mediated rejection is present when endothe-
lial injury and deposition of complement component C4d is detected in 
peritubular capillaries. This is usually accompanied by detection of the 
circulating donor-specific antibody in the recipient’s blood. Treatment 
of antibody-mediated rejection remains a challenge, and aggressive use 
of plasmapheresis, IVIG, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) 
to target B lymphocytes, and bortezomib to target antibody-producing 
plasma cells is indicated. Recently, noninvasive biomarkers such as 
circulating  donor-derived  cell-free  DNA,  urine  chemokine  markers 
(e.g.,  CXCL9),  and  characterization  of  the  urine  exosome  have  been 
used as adjunct diagnostic markers for rejection.
 ■ MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS
Cardiovascular events (29%), infection (18%), and malignancy (17%) 
are the major causes of death in kidney transplant recipients. Typical 
time  courses  of  opportunistic  infections  after  transplantation  are 
shown in Table 313-4.

The signs and symptoms of infection may be atypical due to immu-
nosuppression,  which  makes  diagnosis  challenging.  In  addition  to 
commensal infections, opportunistic infections should be considered 
based on the clinical presentation. Diagnostic measures such as culture 
(blood, urine, drain fluids), viral load in plasma, and imaging (allog-
raft ultrasound and CT) should be obtained. Overall therapy involves 
adequate source control, anti-microorganism therapy, and reduction of 
immunosuppression.

Pneumocystis  jirovecii  is  a  rare  but  critical  opportunistic  infection 
(Chap.  220).  Aggressive  diagnostic  procedures,  including  transbron-
chial  and  open-lung  biopsy,  are  frequently  indicated.  Trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the treatment of choice; amphotericin 
B has been used effectively in systemic fungal infections. Prophylaxis 
against P. jirovecii with daily low-dose TMP-SMX for 6 months is effec-
tive. Involvement of the oropharynx with Candida (Chap. 216) may be 
treated  with  local  nystatin.  Tissue-invasive  fungal  infections  require 
treatment with systemic agents such as fluconazole or one of the newer

antifungal agents. Aspergillus (Chap. 217), Nocardia (Chap. 174), and 
especially cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Chap. 195) infections also occur.
CMV  infection  is  a  serious  complication  after  kidney  transplan-
tation  associated  with  increased  morbidity  and  mortality.  While  the 
seronegative  recipients  of  seropositive  donors  are  at  the  highest  risk, 
presentation  varies  from  asymptomatic  CMV  viremia  to  a  systemic 
syndrome (fever, leukopenia) and tissue-specific manifestation (hepatitis, 
gastroenteritis, and retinopathy). Plasma viral load and a rise in IgM 
antibodies to CMV are diagnostic. Valganciclovir has proved effective 
in  both  prophylaxis  and  treatment  of  CMV  disease.  Acyclovir  is  an 
effective therapy for herpes simplex virus infections.

BK  virus  is  a  latent  polyomavirus  that  lies  dormant  in  the  kidney 
and urothelial tract and can be activated in the setting of immunosup-
pression. Reactivation of BK, if left untreated, will lead to progressive 
fibrosis and loss of the graft within 1 year in most cases. However, as 
risk of reactivation of BK infection is associated with the overall degree 
of  immunosuppression,  in  most  cases,  BK  infection  can  be  managed 
by regular testing of BK viral load and judicious reduction of mainte-
nance immunosuppression. Renal biopsy can be useful in examining 
for the presence of interstitial nephritis, tubular cytopathic changes of 
BK nephropathy, and viral antigens in the allograft. In difficult to treat 
cases beyond reduction in immunosuppression, a variety of therapies 
including leflunomide, cidofovir, and quinolone antibiotics (which are 
effective against polyoma helicase) and IVIG have been tried but with 
inconsistent results.

 ■ CHRONIC LESIONS OF THE TRANSPLANTED 
KIDNEY
Although  current  1-year  transplant  survival  is  excellent,  most  recip-
ients  experience  a  progressive  decline  in  kidney  function  over  time 
thereafter.  Chronic  renal  transplant  dysfunction  can  be  caused  by 
chronic  active  antibody-mediated  rejection,  recurrent  glomerular 
disease,  hypertension,  CNI  nephrotoxicity,  secondary  focal  glomer-
ulosclerosis,  or  a  combination  of  these  pathophysiologies.  Chronic 
vascular  changes  with  intimal  proliferation  and  medial  hypertrophy 
are commonly found. Control of systemic and intrarenal hypertension 
with  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors  is  thought  to 
have a beneficial influence on the rate of progression of chronic renal 
transplant dysfunction. Renal biopsy can distinguish subacute cellular 
rejection from recurrent disease or secondary focal sclerosis.

MALIGNANCY
The  incidence  of  tumors  in  patients  on  immunosuppressive  therapy 
is 5–6%, or ~100 times greater than that in the general population in 
the same age range. The most common lesions are cancer of the skin 
and  lips.  Hence,  surveillance  for  skin  cancers  and  protection  from 
ultraviolet  radiation  are  necessary.  Solid  organ  transplant  recipients 
are  at  higher  risk  to  develop  posttransplant  lymphoproliferative  dis-
ease,  most  frequently  seen  early  (<1  year)  or  late  (7–10  years)  after 
transplantation.  Most  cases  are  associated  with  EBV  infection,  and 
the  prognosis  is  poor.  The  overall  malignancy  risks  are  increased  in 
proportion to the total immunosuppressive load administered and the 
time elapsed since transplantation. Treatment of cancer after transplant 
involves  the  reduction  of  immunosuppression,  surgery,  conventional 
cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  and  radiotherapy.  Cancer  immunotherapy 
is associated with a high risk of allograft rejection (30–40%), and the 
multidisciplinary  risk-benefit  discussion  should  be  made  before  the 
initiation of therapy.

 ■ OTHER COMPLICATIONS
Both  chronic  dialysis  and  renal  transplant  patients  have  a  higher 
incidence  of  death  from  myocardial  infarction  and  stroke  than  the 
population  at  large,  and  this  is  particularly  true  of  diabetic  patients. 
Contributing  factors  are  the  use  of  glucocorticoids  and  sirolimus, 
as  well  as  hypertension.  Recipients  of  renal  transplants  have  a  high 
prevalence  of  coronary  artery  and  peripheral  vascular  diseases.  The 
percentage  of  deaths  from  these  causes  has  been  slowly  rising  as  the 
numbers of transplanted diabetic patients and the average age of recip-
ients increase. More than 30% of kidney transplant recipient mortality

is attributable to cardiovascular disease. Strict control of blood pressure 
and blood sugar and lipid levels is essential in this population.

Hypertension may be caused by (1) native kidney disease, (2) rejection 
activity  in  the  transplant,  (3)  renal  artery  stenosis  if  an  end-to-end 
anastomosis was constructed with an iliac artery branch, and (4) renal 
CNI toxicity, which may improve with reduction in dose. Whereas ACE 
inhibitors may be useful in the longer term, calcium channel blockers 
are more frequently used initially. Amelioration of hypertension to the 
range of 120–130/70–80 mmHg should be the goal in all patients.

Hypercalcemia  after  transplantation  may  indicate  failure  of  hyper-
plastic  parathyroid  glands  to  regress.  Aseptic  necrosis  of  the  head  of 
the femur when it occurs is probably due to preexisting hyperparathy-
roidism, with aggravation by glucocorticoid treatment. With improved 
management of calcium and phosphorus metabolism during chronic 
dialysis, the incidence of parathyroid-related complications has fallen 
dramatically. Persistent hyperparathyroid activity may require subtotal 
parathyroidectomy.

Although  most  transplant  patients  have  robust  production  of  ery-
thropoietin  and  normalization  of  hemoglobin,  anemia  is  commonly 
seen  in  the  posttransplant  period.  Often  the  anemia  is  attributable 
to  bone  marrow–suppressant  immunosuppressive  medications  such 
as  azathioprine,  mycophenolic  acid,  and  mTOR  inhibitors.  Gastroin-
testinal bleeding is a common side effect of high-dose and long-term 
steroid  administration.  Many  transplant  patients  have  creatinine 
clearances  of  30–50  mL/min  and  can  be  considered  to  have  chronic 
renal  insufficiency  for  anemia  management,  including  supplemental 
erythropoietin.

Chronic hepatitis, particularly when due to hepatitis B virus, can be 
a progressive, fatal disease over a decade or so. Patients who are persis-
tently hepatitis B surface antigen–positive are at higher risk, according 
to some studies, but the presence of HCV is also a concern when one 
embarks on a course of immunosuppression in a transplant recipient. 
However,  the  introduction  of  the  new  highly  effective,  direct-acting 
HCV antiviral medications reduced this risk significantly.

In conclusion, while kidney transplantation has progressed signifi-
cantly  toward  the  goals  of  longer  patient  survival  and  better  quality 
of  life,  the  field  still  has  significant  challenges  and  unmet  needs. 
Advanced immunologic and genetic studies have led and will continue 
to lead us to detailed understanding of alloimmunity at the molecular 
level. Noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring and diagnosing rejection 
and  novel  therapeutic  targets  will  continue  to  evolve.  Further  effort 
is needed to achieve equity and improve personalized care of kidney 
transplant recipients.

314 Glomerular Diseases

Julia B. Lewis, Eric G. Neilson

Two  human  kidneys  harbor  nearly  1.8  million  glomerular  capillary 
tufts. Each glomerular tuft resides within Bowman’s space. The capsule 
circumscribing this space is lined by parietal epithelial cells that tran-
sition into tubular epithelia forming the proximal nephron or migrate 
into  the  tuft  to  replenish  podocytes.  The  glomerular  capillary  tuft 
derives from an afferent arteriole that forms a branching capillary bed 
embedded  in  mesangial  matrix  (Fig.  314-1).  This  capillary  network 
funnels  into  an  efferent  arteriole,  which  passes  filtered  blood  into 
cortical peritubular capillaries or medullary vasa recta that supply and 
exchange  with  a  folded  tubular  architecture.  Hence,  the  glomerular 
capillary  tuft,  fed  and  drained  by  arterioles,  represents  an  arteriolar 
portal  system.  Fenestrated  endothelial  cells  resting  on  a  glomerular 
basement membrane (GBM) line glomerular capillaries. Delicate foot 
processes extending from epithelial podocytes shroud the outer surface 
of these capillaries, and adjacent podocytes interconnect to each other 
by slit-pore membranes forming a selective filtration barrier.

The glomerular capillaries filter 120–180 L/d of plasma water con-
taining  various  solutes  for  reclamation  or  discharge  by  downstream 
tubules. Most large proteins and all cells are excluded from filtration 
by a physicochemical barrier governed by pore size and negative elec-
trostatic charge. The mechanics of filtration and reclamation are quite 
complicated for many solutes (Chap. 309). For example, in the case of 
serum albumin, the glomerulus is an imperfect barrier. Although albu-
min  has  a  negative  charge,  which  would  tend  to  repel  the  negatively 
charged GBM, it only has a physical radius of 3.6 nm, while pores in the 
GBM and slit-pore membranes have a radius of 4 nm. Consequently, 
variable  amounts  of  albumin  inevitably  cross  the  filtration  barrier  to 
be  reclaimed  by  megalin  and  cubilin  receptors  along  the  proximal 
tubule. Remarkably, humans with normal nephrons excrete on average 
8–10 mg of albumin in daily voided urine, ~20–60% of total excreted 
protein. This amount of albumin, and other proteins, can rise to gram 
quantities following glomerular injury.

The  breadth  of  diseases  affecting  the  glomerulus  is  expansive 
because  the  microenvironment  supporting  the  glomerular  capillaries 
can be injured in a variety of ways, producing many different lesions. 
Some order to this vast subject is brought by grouping all of these dis-
eases into a smaller number of clinical syndromes.

PATHOGENESIS OF GLOMERULAR DISEASE
There are many forms of glomerular disease with pathogenesis variably 
linked to the presence of genetic mutations, infection, toxin exposure, 
autoimmunity,  atherosclerosis,  hypertension,  emboli,  thrombosis,  or 
diabetes  mellitus.  Even  after  careful  study,  however,  the  cause  often

remains  unknown,  and  the  lesion  is  called  idiopathic.  Specific  or 
unique features of pathogenesis are mentioned with the description of 
each of the glomerular diseases later in this chapter.

Some glomerular diseases result from genetic mutations producing 
familial  disease  or  a  founder  effect:  congenital  nephrotic  syndrome 
from  mutations  in  NPHS1  (nephrin)  and  NPHS2  (podocin)  affects 
the  slit-pore  membrane  at  birth,  and  TRPC6  cation  channel  muta-
tions produce focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in adulthood; 
polymorphisms in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1, APOL1, are a 
major risk for nearly 70% of African Americans with nondiabetic end-
stage renal disease (ESRD), particularly FSGS; monogenetic causes of 
FSGS are increasingly linked to early age of onset and to genes encod-
ing  type  IV  collagen  in  older  adults,  suggesting  that  much  of  FSGS 
may be hereditary; mutations in control of the complement pathway 
increasingly  associate  with  various  forms  of  membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and C3 glomerulopathies including dense 
deposit disease, or atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS); type II 
partial lipodystrophy from mutations in genes encoding lamin A/C or 
PPARγ cause a metabolic syndrome associated with MPGN; Alport’s 
syndrome, from mutations in the genes encoding for the α3, α4, or α5 
chains of type IV collagen, produces split basement membranes with glo-
merulosclerosis; and lysosomal storage diseases, such as α-galactosidase 
A  deficiency  causing  Fabry’s  disease  and  N-acetylneuraminic  acid 
hydrolase deficiency causing nephrosialidosis, produce FSGS.

Systemic  hypertension  and  atherosclerosis  can  produce  pressure 
stress, ischemia, or lipid oxidants that lead to chronic glomerulosclerosis. 
Malignant hypertension can quickly complicate glomerulosclerosis with 
fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles and glomeruli, thrombotic microangio-
pathy,  and  acute  renal  failure.  Diabetic  nephropathy  is  an  acquired 
sclerotic  injury  associated  with  thickening  of  the  GBM  secondary  to 
the long-standing effects of hyperglycemia, advanced glycosylation end 
products, and reactive oxygen species.

Inflammation  of  the  glomerular  capillaries  is  called  glomerulone-
phritis.  Most  glomerular  or  mesangial  antigens  involved  in  immune-
mediated  glomerulonephritis  are  unknown  (Fig.  314-2).  Glomerular 

epithelial or mesangial cells may shed or express epitopes that mimic 
other  immunogenic  proteins  made  elsewhere  in  the  body.  Bacteria, 
fungi, and viruses can directly infect the kidney producing their own 
antigens. Autoimmune diseases such as idiopathic membranous glom-
erulonephritis (MGN) or MPGN are confined to the kidney, whereas 
systemic inflammatory diseases such as lupus nephritis or granulomato-
sis with polyangiitis spread to the kidney, causing secondary glomerular 
injury.  Antiglomerular  basement  membrane  disease  producing  Good-
pasture’s syndrome primarily injures both the lung and kidney because 
of the narrow distribution of the α3 NC1 domain of type IV collagen 
that is the target antigen.

Local activation of Toll-like receptors on glomerular cells, deposi-
tion of immune complexes, or complement injury to glomerular struc-
tures induces mononuclear cell infiltration, which subsequently leads 
to an adaptive immune response attracted to the kidney by local release 
of  chemokines.  Neutrophils,  macrophages,  and  T  cells  are  drawn  by 
chemokines  into  the  glomerular  tuft,  where  they  react  with  antigens 
and  epitopes  on  or  near  somatic  cells  or  their  structures,  producing 
more cytokines and proteases that damage the mesangium, capillaries, 
and/or  the  GBM.  While  the  adaptive  immune  response  is  similar  to 
that of other tissues, early T-cell activation plays an important role in 
the mechanism of glomerulonephritis. Antigens presented by class II 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on macrophages 
and dendritic cells in conjunction with associative recognition mole-
cules engage the CD4/8 T-cell repertoire.

Mononuclear  cells  by  themselves  can  injure  the  kidney,  but  auto-
immune events that damage glomeruli classically produce a humoral 
immune response. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, 
and  idiopathic  membranous  nephritis  typically  are  associated  with 
immune  deposits  along  the  GBM,  while  anti-GBM  antibodies  pro-
duce  the  linear  binding  of  anti-GBM  disease.  Preformed  circulating 
immune complexes can precipitate along the subendothelial side of the 
GBM, while other immune deposits form in situ on the subepithelial 
side. These latter deposits accumulate when circulating autoantibodies 
find  their  antigen  trapped  along  the  subepithelial  edge  of  the  GBM.

FIGURE 314-2  The glomerulus is injured by a variety of mechanisms. A. Preformed immune deposits can precipitate from the circulation and collect along the glomerular 
basement membrane (GBM) in the subendothelial space or can form in situ along the subepithelial space. B. Immunofluorescent staining of glomeruli with labeled anti-
IgG demonstrating linear staining from a patient with anti-GBM disease or immune deposits from a patient with membranous glomerulonephritis. C. The mechanisms of 
glomerular injury have a complicated pathogenesis. Immune deposits and complement deposition classically draw macrophages and neutrophils into the glomerulus. T 
lymphocytes may follow to participate in the injury pattern as well. D. Amplification mediators as locally derived oxidants and proteases expand this inflammation, and 
depending on the location of the target antigen and the genetic polymorphisms of the host, basement membranes are damaged with either endocapillary or extracapillary 
proliferation.

Immune  deposits  in  the  glomerular  mesangium  may  result  from  the 
deposition  of  preformed  circulating  complexes  or  in  situ  antigen- 
antibody interactions. Immune deposits stimulate the release of local 
proteases and activate the complement cascade, producing C5–9 attack 
complexes. In addition, local oxidants damage glomerular structures, 
producing proteinuria and effacement of the podocytes. Overlapping 
etiologies  or  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  can  produce  similar  glo-
merular  lesions,  suggesting  that  downstream  molecular  and  cellular 
responses often converge toward common patterns of injury.

PROGRESSION OF GLOMERULAR DISEASE
Persistent  glomerulonephritis  that  worsens  renal  function  is  always 
accompanied by interstitial nephritis, renal fibrosis, and tubular atro-
phy  (see  Fig.  A4-27).  What  is  not  so  obvious,  however,  is  that  renal 
failure  in  glomerulonephritis  best  correlates  histologically  with  the 
appearance of tubulointerstitial nephritis rather than with the type of 
inciting glomerular injury.

Loss of renal function due to interstitial damage is explained hypo-
thetically  by  several  mechanisms.  The  simplest  explanation  is  that 
urine flow is impeded by tubular obstruction as a result of interstitial 
inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, obstruction of the tubules with debris 
or by extrinsic compression functionally results in aglomerular neph-
rons. A second mechanism suggests that interstitial changes, including 
interstitial  edema  or  fibrosis,  alter  tubular  and  vascular  architecture 
and thereby compromise the normal tubular transport of solutes and 
water from tubular lumen to vascular space. This failure increases the 
solute and water content of the tubule fluid, resulting in isosthenuria 
and  polyuria.  Adaptive  mechanisms  related  to  tubuloglomerular 
feedback  also  fail,  resulting  in  a  reduction  of  renin  output  from  the 
juxtaglomerular apparatus trapped by interstitial inflammation. Con-
sequently,  the  local  vasoconstrictive  influence  of  angiotensin  II  on 
the  glomerular  arterioles  decreases,  and  filtration  drops  owing  to  a 
generalized  decrease  in  arteriolar  tone.  A  third  mechanism  involves 
changes in vascular resistance due to damage of peritubular capillaries.

2334 The  cross-sectional  volume  of  these  capillaries  is  decreased  by  inter-
stitial  inflammation,  edema,  or  fibrosis.  These  structural  alterations 
in vascular resistance affect renal function through two mechanisms. 
First,  tubular  cells  are  very  metabolically  active,  and  as  a  result, 
decreased perfusion leads to tubular ischemic injury. Second, impair-
ment of glomerular arteriolar outflow leads to increased intravascular 
hypertension in less-involved glomeruli; this selective intraglomerular 
hypertension aggravates and extends mesangial sclerosis and glomerulo-
sclerosis to less-involved glomeruli. Regardless of the exact mechanism, 
early acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (see Fig. A4-27) suggests poten-
tially recoverable renal function, whereas the development of chronic 
interstitial fibrosis prognosticates permanent loss (see Fig. A4-30).

Persistent  damage  to  glomerular  capillaries  spreads  to  the  tubu-
lointerstitium  in  association  with  proteinuria.  There  is  a  hypothesis 
that  efferent  arterioles  leading  from  inflamed  glomeruli  carry  for-
ward inflammatory mediators, which induces downstream interstitial 
nephritis,  resulting  in  fibrosis.  Glomerular  filtrate  from  injured  glo-
merular capillaries adherent to Bowman’s capsule may also be misdi-
rected to the periglomerular interstitium. Most nephrologists believe, 
however,  that  proteinuric  glomerular  filtrate  forming  tubular  fluid  is 
the  primary  route  to  downstream  tubulointerstitial  injury,  although 
none of these hypotheses are mutually exclusive.

The simplest explanation for the effect of proteinuria on the devel-
opment of interstitial nephritis is that increasingly severe proteinuria, 
carrying  activated  cytokines  and  lipoproteins  producing  reactive 
oxygen  species,  triggers  a  downstream  inflammatory  cascade  in  and 
around epithelial cells lining the tubular nephron. These effects induce 
T  lymphocyte  and  macrophage  infiltrates  in  the  interstitial  spaces 
along with fibrosis and tubular atrophy.

Tubules  disaggregate  following  direct  damage  to  their  basement 
membranes,  leading  to  more  interstitial  fibroblasts  and  fibrosis  at 
the  site  of  injury;  recent  comprehensive  evidence  suggests  that  renal 
fibroblasts increase through several mechanisms: epithelial or endothe-
lial-mesenchymal transitions (15%), bone marrow–derived fibrocytes 
(35%), and the proliferation of resident fibroblasts (50%). Transform-
ing  growth  factor  β  (TGF-β),  fibroblast  growth  factor  2  (FGF-2), 
hypoxemia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), and platelet-derived growth 
factor (PDGF) are particularly active in this transition. With persistent 
nephritis, fibroblasts multiply and lay down tenascin and a fibronectin 
scaffold for the polymerization of new interstitial collagen types I/III. 
These events form scar tissue through a process called fibrogenesis. In 
experimental  studies,  bone  morphogenetic  protein  7  and  hepatocyte 
growth factor can reverse early fibrogenesis and preserve tubular archi-
tecture. When fibroblasts outdistance their survival factors, apoptosis 
occurs,  and  the  permanent  renal  scar  becomes  acellular,  leading  to 
irreversible renal failure.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Glomerular Disease 

HEMATURIA, PROTEINURIA, AND PYURIA
Patients  with  glomerular  disease  usually  have  some  hematuria 
with varying degrees of proteinuria. Hematuria is typically asymp-
tomatic. As few as 3–5 red blood cells in the spun sediment from 
first-voided  morning  urine  is  suspicious.  The  diagnosis  of  glom-
erular injury can be delayed because patients will not realize they 
have microscopic hematuria, and only rarely with the exception of 

IgA nephropathy and sickle cell disease is gross hematuria present. 
When  working  up  microscopic  hematuria,  perhaps  accompanied 
by minimal proteinuria (<500 mg/24 h), it is important to exclude 
anatomic lesions, such as malignancy of the urinary tract, partic-
ularly in older men. Microscopic hematuria may also appear with 
the  onset  of  benign  prostatic  hypertrophy,  interstitial  nephritis, 
papillary  necrosis,  hypercalciuria,  renal  stones,  cystic  kidney  dis-
eases, or renal vascular injury. However, when red blood cell casts 
(see  Fig.  A4-34)  or  dysmorphic  red  blood  cells  are  found  in  the 
sediment,  glomerulonephritis  is  likely.  A  mean  of  8–10  mg/24  h 
of albumin appears in the urine in the absence of kidney disease. 
In early nephropathy, such as in diabetic nephropathy, proteinuria 
increases  to  30–300  mg/24  h  and  is  called  microalbuminuria  and 
represents the presence of renal disease. Greater than 300 mg/24 h  
of  albuminuria  represents  frank  proteinuria  and  more  advanced 
renal disease (Table 314-1).

Sustained proteinuria >1–2 g/24 h is also commonly associated 
with  glomerular  disease.  Patients  often  will  not  know  they  have 
proteinuria unless they become edematous or notice foaming urine 
on  voiding.  Sustained  proteinuria  has  to  be  distinguished  from 
lesser amounts of so-called benign proteinuria in the normal popu-
lation. (Table 314-1). This latter class of proteinuria is nonsustained, 
generally <1 g/24 h, and is sometimes called functional or transient 
proteinuria.  Fever,  exercise,  obesity,  sleep  apnea,  emotional  stress, 
and  congestive  heart  failure  can  explain  transient  proteinuria. 
Proteinuria  only  seen  with  upright  posture  is  called  orthostatic   
proteinuria and has a benign prognosis. Isolated proteinuria sustained 
over  multiple  clinic  visits  is  found  in  many  glomerular  lesions. 
Proteinuria in most adults with glomerular disease is nonselective, 
containing albumin and a mixture of other serum proteins, whereas 
in children with minimal change disease (MCD), the proteinuria is 
selective and composed largely of albumin.

Some  patients  with  inflammatory  glomerular  disease,  such  as 
acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis or MPGN, have pyuria 
characterized  by  the  presence  of  considerable  numbers  of  leuko-
cytes. This latter finding has to be distinguished from urine infected 
with bacteria. 

CLINICAL SYNDROMES
Various  forms  of  glomerular  injury  can  also  be  parsed  into  sev-
eral  distinct  syndromes  on  clinical  grounds  (Table  314-2).  These 
syndromes,  however,  are  not  always  mutually  exclusive.  There  is 
an  acute  nephritic  syndrome  producing  1–2  g/24  h  of  proteinuria, 
hematuria  with  red  blood  cell  casts,  pyuria,  hypertension,  fluid 
retention, and a rise in serum creatinine associated with a reduc-
tion  in  glomerular  filtration.  If  glomerular  inflammation  devel-
ops  slowly,  the  serum  creatinine  will  rise  gradually  over  many 
weeks,  but  if  the  serum  creatinine  rises  quickly,  particularly  over 
a  few  days,  acute  nephritis  is  sometimes  called  rapidly  progres-
sive glomerulonephritis (RPGN); the histopathologic term crescen-
tic  glomerulonephritis  is  the  pathologic  equivalent  of  the  clinical 
presentation  of  RPGN.  When  patients  with  RPGN  present  with 
lung  hemorrhage  from  Goodpasture’s  syndrome,  antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic  antibody  (ANCA)–associated  small-vessel  vasculitis, 
lupus  erythematosus,  or  cryoglobulinemia,  they  are  often  diag-
nosed as having a pulmonary-renal syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome 
describes  the  onset  of  heavy  proteinuria  (>3.0  g/24  h),  hyperten-
sion,  hypercholesterolemia,  hypoalbuminemia,  edema/anasarca,

aCan present as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN); sometimes called crescentic glomerulonephritis. bCan present as a malignant hypertensive crisis producing 
an aggressive fibrinoid necrosis in arterioles and small arteries with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. cCan present with gross hematuria.

and microscopic hematuria; if only large amounts of proteinuria are 
present without clinical manifestations, the condition is sometimes 
called  nephrotic-range  proteinuria.  The  glomerular  filtration  rate 
(GFR)  in  these  patients  may  initially  be  normal  or,  rarely,  higher 
than  normal,  but  with  persistent  hyperfiltration  and  continued 
nephron  loss,  it  typically  declines  over  months  to  years.  Patients 
with a basement membrane syndrome either have genetically abnor-
mal basement membranes (Alport’s syndrome) or an autoimmune 
response to basement membrane collagen IV (Goodpasture’s syn-
drome)  associated  with  microscopic  hematuria,  mild  to  heavy 
proteinuria,  and  hypertension  with  variable  elevations  in  serum 
creatinine.  Glomerular-vascular  syndrome  describes  patients  with 
vascular  injury  producing  hematuria  and  moderate  proteinuria. 
Affected  individuals  can  have  vasculitis,  thrombotic  microangio-
pathy, antiphospholipid syndrome, or, more commonly, a systemic 
disease  such  as  atherosclerosis,  cholesterol  emboli,  hypertension, 
sickle cell anemia, and autoimmunity. Infectious disease–associated 
syndrome is most important if one has a global perspective. Save for 
subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) in the Western Hemisphere, 
malaria  and  schistosomiasis  may  be  the  most  common  causes  of 
glomerulonephritis throughout the world, closely followed by HIV 
and chronic hepatitis B and C. These infectious diseases produce a 
variety of inflammatory reactions in glomerular capillaries, ranging 
from nephrotic syndrome to acute nephritic injury, and urinalyses 
that demonstrate a combination of hematuria and proteinuria.

These six general categories of syndromes are usually determined 
at the bedside with the help of a history and physical examination, 
blood  chemistries,  renal  ultrasound,  and  urinalysis.  These  initial 
studies help frame further diagnostic workup that typically involves 
testing of the serum for the presence of various proteins (HIV and 
hepatitis B and C antigens) or antibodies (anti-GBM, antiphospho-
lipid,  antistreptolysin  O  [ASO],  PLA2R,  THSD7A,  anti-DNAse, 
antihyaluronidase, ANCA, anti-DNA, cryoglobulins, anti-HIV, and 
anti-hepatitis B and C antibodies) or depletion of complement com-
ponents (C3 and C4). The bedside history and physical examination 
can also help determine whether the glomerulonephritis is isolated 
to the kidney (primary glomerulonephritis) or is part of a systemic 
disease (secondary glomerulonephritis).

When  confronted  with  an  abnormal  urinalysis  and  elevated 
serum creatinine, with or without edema or congestive heart fail-
ure, one must consider whether the glomerulonephritis is acute or 
chronic. This assessment is best made by careful history (last known 
urinalysis  or  serum  creatinine  during  pregnancy  or  insurance 
physical, evidence of infection, or use of medication or recreational 
drugs),  the  size  of  the  kidneys  on  renal  ultrasound  examination, 
and how the patient feels at presentation. Chronic glomerular dis-
ease often presents with decreased kidney size. Patients who quickly 
develop renal failure are fatigued and weak and often have uremic 
symptoms  associated  with  nausea,  vomiting,  fluid  retention,  and 
somnolence.  Primary  glomerulonephritis  presenting  with  renal 
failure  that  has  progressed  slowly,  however,  can  be  remarkably 
asymptomatic, as are patients with acute glomerulonephritis with-
out  much  loss  in  renal  function.  Once  this  initial  information  is 
collected, selected patients who are clinically stable, have adequate 

blood clotting parameters, and are willing and able to receive treat-
ment are encouraged to have a renal biopsy.

 ■ RENAL PATHOLOGY
A renal biopsy in the setting of glomerulonephritis quickly identifies 
the type of glomerular injury and often suggests a course of treatment. 
The biopsy is processed for light microscopy using stains for hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) to assess cellularity and architecture, periodic acid–Schiff 
(PAS) to stain carbohydrate moieties in the membranes of the glomer-
ular  tuft  and  tubules,  Jones-methenamine  silver  to  enhance  basement 
membrane  structure,  Congo  red  for  amyloid  deposits,  and  Masson’s 
trichrome  to  identify  collagen  deposition  and  assess  the  degree  of 
glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Biopsies are also processed 
for  direct  immunofluorescence  using  conjugated  antibodies  against 
IgG, IgM, and IgA to detect the presence of “lumpy-bumpy” immune 
deposits or “linear” IgG or IgA antibodies bound to GBM, antibodies 
against  trapped  complement  proteins  (C3  and  C4),  or  specific  anti-
bodies  against  a  relevant  antigen  (PLA2R,  THSD7A,  and  DNAJB9). 
High-resolution electron microscopy can clarify the principal location 
of immune deposits and the status of the basement membrane.

Each region of a renal biopsy is assessed separately. By light micros-
copy,  glomeruli  (ideally  20)  are  reviewed  individually  for  discrete 
lesions;  <50%  involvement  is  considered  focal,  and  >50%  is  diffuse. 
Injury in each glomerular tuft can be segmental, involving a portion of 
the tuft, or global, involving most of the glomerulus. Glomeruli having 
proliferative characteristics show increased cellularity. When cells in the 
capillary  tuft  proliferate,  it  is  called  endocapillary,  and  when  cellular 
proliferation  extends  into  Bowman’s  space,  it  is  called  extracapillary. 
Synechiae  are  formed  when  epithelial  podocytes  attach  to  Bowman’s 
capsule  in  the  setting  of  glomerular  injury;  crescents,  which  in  some 
cases may be the extension of synechiae, develop when fibrocellular/
fibrin collections fill all or part of Bowman’s space; and sclerotic glo-
meruli  show  acellular,  amorphous  accumulations  of  proteinaceous 
material  throughout  the  tuft  with  loss  of  functional  capillaries  and 
normal  mesangium.  Since  age-related  glomerulosclerosis  is  common 
in adults, one can estimate the background percentage of sclerosis by 
dividing the patient’s age in half and subtracting 10. Immunofluores-
cent and electron microscopy can detect the presence and location of 
subepithelial,  subendothelial,  or  mesangial  immune  deposits,  or  redu-
plication or splitting of the basement membrane. In the other regions 
of the biopsy, the vasculature surrounding glomeruli and tubules can 
show  angiopathy,  vasculitis,  the  presence  of  fibrils,  or  thrombi.  The 
tubules can be assessed for adjacency to one another; separation can be 
the result of edema, tubular dropout, or collagen deposition resulting 
from interstitial fibrosis. Interstitial fibrosis is an ominous sign of irre-
versibility and progression to renal failure.

ACUTE NEPHRITIC SYNDROMES
Acute nephritic syndromes classically present with hypertension, hema-
turia, red blood cell casts, pyuria, and mild to moderate proteinuria. 
Extensive inflammatory damage to glomeruli causes a fall in GFR and 
eventually  produces  uremic  symptoms  with  salt  and  water  retention, 
leading to edema and hypertension.

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tract ■ POSTSTREPTOCOCCAL GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
Poststreptococcal  glomerulonephritis  is  prototypical  for  acute 
endocapillary  proliferative  glomerulonephritis.  The  incidence  of  post-
streptococcal glomerulonephritis has dramatically decreased in devel-
oped  countries,  and  in  these  locations  is  typically  sporadic.  Acute 
nephritis in underdeveloped countries is epidemic and usually affects 
children between the ages of 2 and 14 years. In developed countries, it 
is more typical in the elderly, especially in association with debilitating 
conditions. It is more common in males, and the familial or cohabitant 
incidence is as high as 40%. Skin and more commonly throat infections 
with particular M types of streptococci (nephritogenic strains) antedate 
glomerular disease. Antibiotic therapy does not reduce the occurrence 
of nephritis. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis due to pharyngitis 
develops 1–3 weeks after infection and 2–6 weeks after impetigo.

The  renal  biopsy  in  poststreptococcal  glomerulonephritis  demon-
strates hypercellularity of mesangial and endothelial cells; glomerular 
infiltrates  of  polymorphonuclear  leukocytes;  granular  subendothelial 
immune  deposits  of  IgG,  IgM,  C3,  C4,  and  C5–9;  and  subepithelial 
deposits (which appear as “humps”) (see Fig. A4-6). (See Glomerular 
Schematic  1.)  Poststreptococcal  glomerulonephritis  is  an  immune-
mediated disease involving putative streptococcal antigens, circulating 
immune complexes, and activation of complement in association with 
cell-mediated  injury.  Many  candidate  antigens  have  been  proposed 
over  the  years;  candidates  from  nephritogenic  streptococci  are  a  cat-
ionic  cysteine  proteinase  known  as  streptococcal  pyrogenic  exotoxin 
B  (SPEB)  and  NAPlr,  the  nephritis-associated  plasmin  receptor.  The 
nephritogenic antigen SPEB has been demonstrated inside the subepi-
thelial “humps” on biopsy.

The  classic  presentation  is  an  acute  nephritic  picture  with  hema-
turia,  pyuria,  red  blood  cell  casts,  edema,  hypertension,  and  oliguric 
renal  failure,  which  may  be  severe  enough  to  appear  as  RPGN.  Sys-
temic symptoms of headache, malaise, anorexia, and flank pain (due 
to  swelling  of  the  renal  capsule)  are  reported  in  as  many  as  50%  of 
cases. Five percent of children and 20% of adults have proteinuria in 
the nephrotic range. In the first week of symptoms, 90% of patients will 
have a depressed CH50 and decreased levels of C3 with normal levels 
of C4. Positive rheumatoid factor (30–40%), cryoglobulins, circulating 
immune  complexes  (60–70%),  and  ANCA  against  myeloperoxidase 
(10%)  are  also  reported.  Positive  cultures  for  streptococcal  infection 
are inconsistently present (10–70%), but increased titers of ASO (30%), 
anti-DNAse  (70%),  or  antihyaluronidase  antibodies  (40%)  can  help 
confirm  the  diagnosis.  Consequently,  the  diagnosis  of  poststrepto-
coccal glomerulonephritis rarely requires a renal biopsy. A subclinical 
disease is reported in some series to be 4–5 times as common as clinical 
nephritis,  and  these  latter  cases  are  characterized  by  asymptomatic 
microscopic hematuria with low serum C3 complement levels.

Treatment is supportive, with control of hypertension, edema, and 
dialysis as needed. Antibiotic treatment for active streptococcal infec-
tion should be given to patients and their cohabitants. There is no role 
for immunosuppressive therapy, even in the setting of crescents. Recur-
rent  poststreptococcal  glomerulonephritis  is  rare  despite  repeated 
streptococcal infections. Early death is rare in children but does occur 
in  the  elderly.  Complete  resolution  of  the  azotemia,  hematuria,  and 
proteinuria  in  the  majority  of  children  occurs  within  3–6  weeks  of 
the  onset  of  nephritis,  but  3–10%  of  children  may  have  persistent 
microscopic  hematuria,  nonnephrotic  proteinuria,  or  hypertension. 
Overall, the prognosis is good, with ESRD being very uncommon in 
children and adults. The prognosis in elderly patients is worse, with a 
high incidence of azotemia (up to 60%), nephrotic-range proteinuria, 
and ESRD.

 ■ SUBACUTE BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS
Endocarditis-associated  glomerulonephritis  is  typically  a  complication 
of SBE, particularly in patients who remain untreated for a long time, 
have negative blood cultures, or have right-sided endocarditis. Com-
mon  comorbidities  are  valvular  heart  disease,  intravenous  drug  use, 
hepatitis  C,  and  diabetes  mellitus.  Glomerulonephritis  is  unusual  in 
acute  bacterial  endocarditis  because  it  takes  10–14  days  to  develop 
immune complex–mediated injury, by which time the patient has been 
treated, often with emergent surgery. Grossly, the kidneys in SBE have 
subcapsular hemorrhages with a “flea-bitten” appearance, and micros-
copy on renal biopsy reveals focal proliferation around foci of necrosis 
associated with abundant mesangial, subendothelial, and subepithelial 
immune  deposits  of  IgG,  IgM,  and  C3.  Commonly  patients  present 
with a clinical picture of RPGN and have crescents on biopsy. Embolic 
infarcts  or  septic  abscesses  may  also  be  present.  The  pathogenesis 
hinges  on  the  renal  deposition  of  circulating  immune  complexes  in 
the  kidney  with  complement  activation.  Patients  present  with  gross 
or microscopic hematuria, pyuria, and mild proteinuria, acute kidney 
injury, or RPGN with rapid loss of renal function. A normocytic ane-
mia,  elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate,  hypocomplementemia, 
high  titers  of  rheumatoid  factor,  type  III  cryoglobulins,  circulating 
immune complexes, and ANCAs may be present. Levels of serum cre-
atinine may be elevated at diagnosis, but with modern therapy, there is 
little progression to chronic renal failure. Primary treatment is eradica-
tion of the infection with 4–6 weeks of antibiotics, and if accomplished 
expeditiously, the prognosis for renal recovery is good. ANCA-associated 
vasculitis sometimes accompanies or is confused with SBE and should 
be ruled out, as the treatment is different.

As  variants  of  persistent  bacterial  infection  in  blood-associated 
glomerulonephritis,  postinfectious  glomerulonephritis  can  occur  in 
patients  with  ventriculoatrial  and  ventriculoperitoneal  shunts;  pul-
monary, intraabdominal, pelvic, or cutaneous infections; and infected 
vascular  prostheses.  In  developed  countries,  a  significant  proportion 
of  cases  afflict  adults,  especially  the  immunocompromised,  and  the 
predominant  organism  is  Staphylococcus.  The  clinical  presentation 
of  these  conditions  is  variable  and  includes  proteinuria,  microscopic 
hematuria, acute renal failure, and hypertension. Serum complement 
levels are low, and there may be elevated levels of C-reactive proteins, 
rheumatoid  factor,  antinuclear  antibodies,  and  cryoglobulins.  Renal 
lesions  include  MPGN,  diffuse  proliferative  and  exudative  glomer-
ulonephritis  (DPGN),  or  mesangioproliferative  glomerulonephritis, 
sometimes  leading  to  RPGN.  Treatment  focuses  on  eradicating  the 
infection, with most patients treated as if they have endocarditis. The 
prognosis is guarded.

 ■ LUPUS NEPHRITIS
Lupus  nephritis  is  a  common  and  serious  complication  of  systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE). Clinical manifestations of renal disease are 
present in 30% of patients at the time of diagnosis, and the majority 
will  develop  renal  abnormalities  in  the  course  of  their  disease;  it  is 
more  common  in  blacks,  Asians,  and  Hispanics  than  it  is  in  whites. 
Lupus  nephritis  results  from  the  deposition  of  circulating  immune 
complexes composed of primarily DNA and anti-DNA, which activate 
the  complement  cascade,  leading  to  complement-mediated  damage,

2338 leukocyte infiltration, activation of procoagulant factors, and release of 
various cytokines. In situ immune complex formation also plays a role 
in  renal  injury.  These  immune  deposits  may  occur  in  the  mesangial, 
subendothelial, and/or subepithelial spaces.

The  clinical  manifestations,  course  of  disease,  and  treatment  of 
lupus nephritis are closely linked to renal pathology. The most com-
mon clinical sign of renal disease is proteinuria, but hematuria, hyper-
tension,  varying  degrees  of  renal  failure,  and  active  urine  sediment 
with  red  blood  cell  casts  can  all  be  present.  Anti-dsDNA  antibodies 
that  fix  complement  correlate  best  with  the  presence  of  renal  dis-
ease.  Hypocomplementemia  is  common  in  patients  with  acute  lupus 
nephritis  (70–90%),  and  declining  complement  levels  may  herald  a 
flare. A kidney biopsy should be performed in most patients with renal 
involvement to establish the histologic subtype, which guides therapy.
The World Health Organization (WHO) workshop in 1974 first out-
lined several distinct patterns of lupus-related glomerular injury, and 
this classification was modified in 2004. This latest version of lesions 
seen  on  biopsy  (Table  314-3)  forms  the  basis  for  modern  treatment 
recommendations. Class I nephritis describes normal glomerular his-
tology  by  normal  light  microscopy  with  minimal  mesangial  deposits 
on  immunofluorescent  or  electron  microscopy.  Class  II  designates 
mesangial immune complexes with mesangial proliferation. Both class I 
and II lesions are typically associated with minimal renal manifestation 
and normal renal function; nephrotic syndrome is rare. Patients with 
lesions limited to the renal mesangium have an excellent prognosis and 
generally do not need therapy for their lupus nephritis.

The  subject  of  lupus  nephritis  is  presented  under  acute  nephritic 
syndromes  because  of  the  aggressive  and  important  proliferative 
lesions  seen  in  class  III–V  renal  diseases.  Class  III  describes  focal 
lesions  involving  <50%  of  the  glomeruli  with  proliferation  or  scarring, 
often  involving  only  a  segment  of  the  glomerulus  (see  Fig.  A4-12). 
Class  III  lesions  have  the  most  varied  course.  Hematuria  and  pro-
teinuria  are  present,  and  some  patients  also  have  an  active  urinary 
sediment,  nephrotic  syndrome,  hypertension,  and  a  decreased  GFR. 
Patients  with  mild  proliferation  involving  a  small  percentage  of  glo-
meruli respond well to therapy with steroids alone, and <5% progress 
to  renal  failure  over  5  years.  Patients  with  more  severe  proliferation 
involving a greater percentage of glomeruli have a far worse prognosis 
and lower remission rates. Treatment of those patients is the same as 
that for class IV lesions. Class IV describes diffuse lesions with >50% 
of the glomeruli involved and proliferative endocapillary lesions with or 
without  extracapillary  lesions  that  may  be  segmental  (IV-S),  involving 
<50% of the glomerular tuft, or global (IV-G), involving >50%. Patients 
with class IV lesions commonly have high anti-DNA antibody titers, 
low  serum  complement,  hematuria,  red  blood  cell  casts,  proteinuria, 
hypertension,  and  decreased  renal  function;  50%  of  patients  have 
nephrotic-range  proteinuria.  Patients  with  crescents  on  biopsy  often 
have a rapidly progressive decline in renal function (see Fig. A4-12).

Without treatment, this aggressive lesion has the worst renal progno-
sis, with class IV-S worse than class IV-G. However, if a remission—
defined  as  a  return  to  near-normal  renal  function  and  proteinuria 
≤330 mg/dL per day—is achieved with treatment, renal outcomes are 
excellent.  Current  evidence  suggests  that  inducing  a  remission  with 
administration  of  high-dose  steroids  and  either  cyclophosphamide 
or  mycophenolate  mofetil  for  2–6  months,  followed  by  maintenance 
therapy  with  lower  doses  of  steroids  and  mycophenolate  mofetil  or 
azathioprine, best balances the likelihood of successful remission with 
the side effects of therapy. There is no consensus on use of high-dose 
intravenous  methylprednisolone  versus  oral  prednisone,  monthly 
intravenous cyclophosphamide versus daily oral cyclophosphamide, or 
other immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or rituxi-
mab. Nephrologists tend to avoid prolonged use of cyclophosphamide 
in patients of childbearing age without first banking eggs or sperm.

The class V lesion describes subepithelial immune deposits produc-
ing a membranous pattern; a subcategory of class V lesions is associated 
with proliferative lesions and is sometimes called mixed membranous 
and  proliferative  disease  (see  Fig.  A4-11);  this  category  of  injury  is 
treated like class IV glomerulonephritis. Sixty percent of patients pres-
ent with nephrotic syndrome or lesser amounts of proteinuria. Patients 
with lupus nephritis class V, like patients with idiopathic membranous 
nephropathy  (IMN),  are  predisposed  to  renal  vein  thrombosis  and 
other  thrombotic  complications.  A  minority  of  patients  with  class  V 
will present with hypertension and renal dysfunction. There are con-
flicting data on the clinical course, prognosis, and appropriate therapy 
for patients with class V disease, which may reflect the heterogeneity 
of  this  group  of  patients.  Patients  with  severe  nephrotic  syndrome, 
elevated  serum  creatinine,  and  a  progressive  course  will  probably 
benefit from therapy with steroids in combination with other immu-
nosuppressive agents. Therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin 
system also may attenuate the proteinuria. Antiphospholipid antibod-
ies  present  in  lupus  may  result  in  glomerular  microthromboses  and 
a  thrombotic  microangiopathy.  The  renal  prognosis  is  worse  despite 
anticoagulant therapy.

Patients with any of the above lesions also can transform to another 
lesion;  hence,  patients  often  require  reevaluation,  including  repeat 
renal biopsy. Lupus patients with class VI lesions have >90% sclerotic 
glomeruli  and  ESRD  with  interstitial  fibrosis.  Up  to  20%  of  patients 
with  lupus  nephritis  will  reach  end-stage  disease,  requiring  dialysis 
or  transplantation.  Patients  with  lupus  nephritis  have  a  markedly 
increased  mortality  compared  with  the  general  population.  Renal 
transplantation in renal failure from lupus, usually performed after ~6 
months of inactive disease, results in allograft survival rates compara-
ble to patients transplanted for other reasons.

 ■ ANTIGLOMERULAR BASEMENT MEMBRANE 
DISEASE
Patients  who  develop  autoantibodies  directed  against  glomerular 
basement  antigens  frequently  develop  a  glomerulonephritis  termed 
antiglomerular  basement  membrane  (anti-GBM)  disease.  When  they 
present  with  lung  hemorrhage  and  glomerulonephritis,  they  have  a 
pulmonary-renal syndrome called Goodpasture’s syndrome. The target 
epitopes  for  this  autoimmune  disease  lie  in  the  quaternary  structure 
of  α3  NC1  domain  of  collagen  IV.  Indeed,  anti-GBM  disease  may 
be  considered  an  autoimmune  “conformeropathy”  that  involves  the 
perturbation of quaternary structure of the α 345NC1 hexamer. MHC- 
restricted  T  cells  initiate  the  autoantibody  response  because  humans 
are  not  tolerant  to  the  epitopes  created  by  this  quaternary  structure. 
The epitopes are normally sequestered in the collagen IV hexamer and 
can be exposed by infection, smoking, oxidants, or solvents. Goodpas-
ture’s syndrome appears in two age groups: in young men in their late 
twenties and in men and women in their sixties and seventies. Younger 
patients  are  more  likely  to  present  with  the  full  Goodpasture’s  syn-
drome, with hemoptysis, a sudden fall in hemoglobin, fever, dyspnea, 
and hematuria, and older patients are more likely to present with iso-
lated glomerulonephritis. Hemoptysis is largely confined to smokers, 
and those who present with lung hemorrhage as a group do better than 
older  populations  who  have  prolonged,  asymptomatic  renal  injury;

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractpresentation  with  oliguria  is  often  associated  with  a  particularly  bad 
outcome. The performance of an urgent kidney biopsy is important in 
suspected  cases  of  Goodpasture’s  syndrome  to  confirm  the  diagnosis 
and assess prognosis. Renal biopsies typically show focal or segmental 
necrosis  that  later,  with  aggressive  destruction  of  the  capillaries  by 
cellular  proliferation,  leads  to  crescent  formation  in  Bowman’s  space  
(see Fig. A4-14). As these lesions progress, there is concomitant inter-
stitial nephritis with fibrosis and tubular atrophy.

The presence of anti-GBM antibodies and complement is recognized 
on biopsy by linear immunofluorescent staining for IgG (rarely IgA). 
In testing serum for anti-GBM antibodies, it is particularly important 
that  the  α3  NC1  domain  of  collagen  IV  alone  be  used  as  the  target. 
This  is  because  nonnephritic  antibodies  against  the  α1  NC1  domain 
are  seen  in  paraneoplastic  syndromes  and  cannot  be  discerned  from 
assays  that  use  whole  basement  membrane  fragments  as  the  binding 
target. Between 10 and 15% of sera from patients with Goodpasture’s 
syndrome  also  contain  ANCA  antibodies  against  myeloperoxidase. 
Prognosis at presentation is worse if there are >50% crescents on renal 
biopsy  with  advanced  fibrosis,  if  serum  creatinine  is  >5–6  mg/dL,  if 
oliguria is present, or if there is a need for acute dialysis. Patients who 
present with hemoptysis should be treated for their lung hemorrhage, 
as it responds to plasmapheresis. Treated patients with less severe dis-
ease typically respond to 8–10 treatments of plasmapheresis accompa-
nied by oral prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Maintenance therapy 
with  low-dose  immunosuppressants  should  be  considered  until  anti-
body titers are negative. There are scarce data alternatively using ritux-
imab, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil. Kidney transplantation 
should wait for 6 months and until serum antibodies are undetectable.

 ■ IgA NEPHROPATHY
Berger  first  described  the  glomerulonephritis  now  termed  IgA  neph-
ropathy. It is classically characterized by episodic hematuria associated 
with the deposition of IgA in the mesangium. IgA nephropathy is one 
of  the  most  common  forms  of  glomerulonephritis  worldwide.  There 
is  a  male  preponderance,  a  peak  incidence  in  the  second  and  third 
decades of life, and rare familial clustering. There are geographic differ-
ences in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy, with 30% prevalence along 
the Asian and Pacific Rim and 20% in southern Europe, compared to a 
much lower prevalence in northern Europe and North America. This 
may reflect variation in detection or a true variation among racial and 
ethnic groups.

IgA nephropathy is predominantly a sporadic disease, but suscep-
tibility  to  it  has  been  shown  uncommonly  to  have  a  genetic  compo-
nent  depending  on  geography  and  the  existence  of  “founder  effects.” 
Familial  forms  of  IgA  nephropathy  are  more  common  in  northern 
Italy and eastern Kentucky. No single causal gene has been identified. 
Clinical  and  laboratory  evidence  suggests  close  similarities  between 
Henoch-Schönlein purpura and IgA nephropathy. Henoch-Schönlein 
purpura is distinguished clinically from IgA nephropathy by prominent 
systemic symptoms, a younger age (<20 years old), preceding infection, 
and abdominal complaints. Deposits of IgA are also found in the glom-
erular mesangium in a variety of systemic diseases, including chronic 
liver  disease,  Crohn’s  disease,  celiac  disease,  chronic  bronchiectasis, 
idiopathic  interstitial  pneumonia,  dermatitis  herpetiformis,  mycosis 
fungoides,  ankylosing  spondylitis,  HIV  infection,  and  Sjögren’s  syn-
drome. IgA deposition in these entities is not usually associated with 
clinically  significant  renal  disease.  IgG  A-dominant  Staphylococcus- 
associated  postinfectious  glomerulonephritis  is  associated  with  clini-
cally significant renal disease.

The  pathognomonic  finding  on  kidney  biopsy  is  dominant  or 
codominant mesangial IgA deposits, either alone or with IgG, IgM, or 
C3. (See Glomerular Schematic 2.) IgA deposits are typically J-chain 
containing  polymeric  IgA.  Abnormalities  have  been  described  in 
IgA production by plasma cells, in IgA clearance by the liver, and in 
mesangial  IgA  clearance  and  receptors  for  IgA.  Currently,  however, 
abnormalities in the O-glycosylation of the hinge region of primarily 
polymeric IgA1 seem to best account for the pathogenesis of sporadic 
IgA  nephropathy.  Synthesis  of  poorly  galactosylated  IgA1  results  in 
exposure of N-acetyl-galactosamine in truncated IgA1 hinge regions,

which  is  recognized  by  IgG  or  IgA1  antibodies  leading  to  formation 
of  immune  complexes  in  the  circulation  or  in  situ  after  glomerular 
deposition of galactose-deficient IgA1. A second hit, such as a viral or 
other  antigen  exposure,  or  hereditary  defects  in  alternative  comple-
ment pathway proteins may affect the manifestation of disease. Despite 
the  presence  of  elevated  serum  IgA  levels  in  20–50%  of  patients  and 
IgA deposition in skin biopsies in 15–55% of patients, a renal biopsy is 
necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Although the immunofluorescent 
pattern of IgA on renal biopsy defines IgA nephropathy in the proper 
clinical  context,  a  variety  of  histologic  lesions  may  be  seen  on  light 
microscopy (see Fig. A4-8), including DPGN; segmental sclerosis; and, 
rarely, segmental necrosis with cellular crescent formation, which typi-
cally presents as RPGN.

The  two  most  common  presentations  of  IgA  nephropathy  are 
recurrent  episodes  of  macroscopic  hematuria  during  or  immediately 
following  an  upper  respiratory  infection  often  accompanied  by  pro-
teinuria  and  persistent  asymptomatic  microscopic  hematuria.  Neph-
rotic  syndrome  is  uncommon.  Proteinuria  can  also  first  appear  late 
in the course of the disease. Rarely, patients present with acute renal 
failure  and  a  rapidly  progressive  clinical  picture.  IgA  nephropathy  is 
a  benign  disease  for  the  majority  of  patients,  and  5–30%  of  patients 
may go into a complete remission, with others having hematuria but 
well-preserved  renal  function.  In  the  minority  of  patients  who  have 
progressive disease, progression is slow, with renal failure seen in only 
25–30% of patients with IgA nephropathy over 20–25 years. This risk 
varies considerably among populations. Cumulatively, risk factors for 
the loss of renal function identified thus far account for <50% of the 
variation in observed outcome but include the presence of hyperten-
sion or proteinuria, the absence of episodes of macroscopic hematuria, 
male  sex,  and  older  age  of  onset.  Mesangial  hypercellularity  (M), 
endocapillary  hypercellularity  (E),  segmental  glomerulosclerosis  (S), 
tubular interstitial fibrosis (T), and crescents (C) have predictive value 
as  established  by  the  Oxford  Classification  and  the  MEST-C  score. 
Several analyses in large populations of patients found persistent pro-
teinuria for 6 months or longer to have the greatest predictive power 
for adverse renal outcomes.

There is no agreement on optimal treatment. Both large studies that 
include  patients  with  multiple  glomerular  diseases  and  small  studies 
of  patients  with  IgA  nephropathy  support  the  use  of  angiotensin-
converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors  in  patients  with  proteinuria  or 
declining  renal  function.  In  patients  with  persistent  proteinuria  after

2340 ACE inhibitor therapy, steroid treatment or other immunosuppressives 
have demonstrated conflicting results. Tonsillectomy and fish oil have 
also  been  suggested  in  small  studies  to  benefit  select  patients.  When 
presenting  as  RPGN,  patients  typically  receive  steroids,  cytotoxic 
agents, and plasmapheresis.

 ■ ANCA SMALL-VESSEL VASCULITIS
A  group  of  patients  with  small-vessel  vasculitis  (arterioles,  capillar-
ies,  and  venules;  rarely  small  arteries)  and  glomerulonephritis  have 
serum ANCA; the antibodies are of two types, anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) 
or  anti-myeloperoxidase  (MPO)  (Chap.  363).  ANCA  are  produced 
with the help of T cells and activate leukocytes and monocytes, which 
together  damage  the  walls  of  small  vessels.  Endothelial  injury  also 
attracts  more  leukocytes  and  extends  the  inflammation.  Granuloma-
tosis  with  polyangiitis,  microscopic  polyangiitis,  Churg-Strauss  syn-
drome, and renal-limited vasculitis belong to this group because they 
are ANCA-positive and have a pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with 
few  immune  complexes  in  small  vessels  and  glomerular  capillaries. 
Patients  with  any  of  these  diseases  can  have  any  combination  of  the 
above serum antibodies, but anti-PR3 antibodies are more common in 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and anti-MPO antibodies are more 
common in microscopic polyangiitis or Churg-Strauss. Although each 
of these diseases has some unique clinical features, most features do not 
predict relapse or progression, and as a group, they are generally treated 
in the same way. Once diagnosed, ANCA monitoring has limited value, 
but targeted determination of ANCA levels may be useful if a relapse 
is clinically suspected. Since mortality is high without treatment, vir-
tually all patients receive urgent treatment. Induction therapy usually 
includes  glucocorticoids  and  either  cyclophosphamide  or  rituximab. 
Plasmapheresis is recommended in rapidly progressive renal failure or 
pulmonary hemorrhage. Remission is induced in 85–90% of patients, 
but relapse is common. Steroids are tapered soon after acute inflam-
mation subsides. Maintenance therapy includes low-dose steroids and 
cyclophosphamide  or  less  toxic  agents  such  as  azathioprine,  metho-
trexate, or rituximab for up to a year to minimize the risk of relapse.

Granulomatosis  with  Polyangiitis  Patients  with  this  disease 
classically present with fever, purulent rhinorrhea, nasal ulcers, sinus 
pain, polyarthralgias/arthritis, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, 
hematuria,  and  subnephrotic  proteinuria;  occasionally,  there  may  be 
cutaneous purpura and mononeuritis multiplex. Patients may present 
without  renal  involvement,  although  most  of  these  patients  develop 
renal  injury  later.  Chest  x-ray  often  reveals  nodules  and  persistent 
infiltrates,  sometimes  with  cavities.  Biopsy  of  involved  tissue  will 
show a small-vessel vasculitis and adjacent noncaseating granulomas. 
Renal biopsies during active disease demonstrate segmental necrotizing 
glomerulonephritis without immune deposits and have been classified 
as focal, mixed, crescentic, or sclerotic (see Fig. A4-13). The disease 
is  more  common  in  patients  exposed  to  silica  dust  and  those  with 
α1-antitrypsin  deficiency,  which  is  an  inhibitor  of  PR3.  Relapse  after 
achieving remission is common and is more common in patients with 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis than the other ANCA-associated vas-
culitis, necessitating diligent follow-up care. Although associated with 
an  unacceptable  high  mortality  rate  without  treatment,  the  greatest 
threat to patients, especially elderly patients in the first year of therapy, 
is from adverse events, which are often secondary to treatment, rather 
than active vasculitis. Patients should also be monitored long term for 
malignancy after immunosuppressive therapy.

Microscopic  Polyangiitis  Clinically,  these  patients  look  some-
what  similar  to  those  with  granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis,  except 
they  rarely  have  significant  lung  disease  or  destructive  sinusitis.  The 
distinction  is  made  on  biopsy,  where  the  vasculitis  in  microscopic 
polyangiitis is without granulomas. Some patients will also have injury 
limited to the capillaries and venules.

Churg-Strauss  Syndrome  When  small-vessel  vasculitis  is  asso-
ciated with peripheral eosinophilia, cutaneous purpura, mononeuritis, 
asthma,  and  allergic  rhinitis,  a  diagnosis  of  Churg-Strauss  syndrome 
(eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA]) is considered. 

Hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated levels of serum IgE, or the pres-
ence  of  rheumatoid  factor  sometimes  accompanies  the  allergic  state. 
Lung  inflammation,  including  fleeting  cough  and  pulmonary  infil-
trates, often precedes the systemic manifestations of disease by years; 
lung  manifestations  are  rarely  absent.  A  third  of  patients  may  have 
exudative  pleural  effusions  associated  with  eosinophils.  Small-vessel 
vasculitis  and  focal  segmental  necrotizing  glomerulonephritis  without 
immune deposits can be seen on renal biopsy, usually absent eosino-
phils or granulomas. The cause of Churg-Strauss syndrome is autoim-
mune, but the inciting factors are unknown.
 ■ C3 GLOMERULOPATHIES
C3 glomerulopathy is a recent disease classification that is defined by 
the glomerular accumulation of C3 with little or no immunoglobulin 
and encompasses dense deposit disease (DDD), formerly MPGN type 
II (see below), and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) (Table 314-4). DDD 
is defined morphologically by dense deposits forming ribbons in the 
GBM. In the absence of this specific morphology, the entity is catego-
rized as C3GN. Both are associated with the presence of a complement 
mutation believed to cause the renal pathology, including mutations in 
the  complement  factor  H  regulatory  (CFHR)  protein  genes.  DDD  is 
primarily a disease of children and young adults, whereas the other C3 
glomerulopathies are reported to present in an older age group (mean 
age  30).  By  definition,  kidneys  with  C3  glomerulopathy  show  sole  or 
dominant staining for C3 but can have variable light microscopy, with 
mesangial  proliferative  or  membranoproliferative  patterns  seen  most 
commonly. Morphologically, many cases are not distinguishable from 
recovering postinfectious glomerulonephritis. Patients with DDD pres-
ent with proteinuria, which may be nephrotic range, and/or hematuria, 
which may be macroscopic or microscopic. Partial lipodystrophy and 
Drusen  bodies  in  the  retina  may  also  be  present.  Prognosis  is  poor, 
with 50% of patients progressing to ESRD. C3GN patients are clinically 
less  well  defined,  but  approximately  two-thirds  have  hematuria  and 
one-third have proteinuria. C3 levels are low with normal C4, and C3 
nephritic factor is present in most patients with DDD and less com-
monly in C3GN. Abnormalities in factor H, soluble C5b-9, paraprotein 
detection, and specific CFHR genetic mutations should be assessed as 
well. Screening family members may be indicated. The optimal thera-
pies remain undefined but include inhibition of the renin-angiotensin

dence  suggests  a  benefit  of  therapy  with  eculizumab,  a  monoclonal 
antibody directed at C5, which is activated by C3.
 ■ MEMBRANOPROLIFERATIVE 
GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
MPGN  is  characterized  by  thickening  of  the  GBM  with  mesangio-
proliferative  changes  often  leading  to  a  lobular  appearance  of  the 
glomerular  tuft;  70%  of  patients  have  hypocomplementemia.  MPGN 
is rare in African Americans, and idiopathic disease usually presents 
in childhood or young adulthood. MPGN has been subdivided based 
on histology into type I, type II, and type III disease. Type I MPGN is 
immune complex–mediated and commonly associated with persistent 
hepatitis  B  and  C,  fungal  and  parasitic  infections,  SBE,  autoimmune 
diseases  such  as  lupus  or  cryoglobulinemia,  or  monoclonal  gam-
mopathies,  including  monoclonal  gammopathy  of  renal  significance 
(MGRS),  where  the  only  clinically  apparent  manifestations  are  in 
the  kidney  (Table  314-4).  Types  II  and  III  MPGN  can  be  idiopathic 
and  immunoglobulin-mediated  disease  (driven  by  the  classical  com-
plement pathway), but the vast majority of cases formerly defined as 
MPGN  type  II  or  III  are  non-immunoglobulin-mediated  and  driven 
by the alternate complement pathway.

Type  I  MPGN,  the  most  proliferative  of  the  three  types,  shows 
mesangial proliferation with lobular segmentation on renal biopsy and 
mesangial  interposition  between  the  capillary  basement  membrane 
and  endothelial  cells,  producing  a  double  contour  sometimes  called 
tram-tracking  (see  Fig.  A4-9).  (See  Glomerular  Schematic  3.)  Sub-
endothelial deposits with low serum levels of C3 are typical, although 
50% of patients have normal levels of C3 and occasional intramesangial 
deposits. Low serum C3 and a dense thickening of the GBM containing 
ribbons  of  dense  deposits  and  C3  characterize  type  II  MPGN,  dense 
deposit  disease  (see  Fig.  A4-10).  Classically,  the  glomerular  tuft  has 
a  lobular  appearance;  intramesangial  deposits  are  rarely  present,  and 
subendothelial  deposits  are  generally  absent.  Proliferation  in  type  III 
MPGN  is  less  common  than  the  other  two  types  and  is  often  focal; 
mesangial  interposition  is  rare,  and  subepithelial  deposits  as  well  as 
subendothelial  deposits  can  occur  along  widened  segments  of  the 
GBM that appear laminated and disrupted.

Classic  type  I  MPGN  is  secondary  to  glomerular  deposition  of 
circulating  immune  complexes  or  their  in  situ  formation.  Patients 
with  MPGN  present  with  proteinuria,  hematuria,  and  pyuria  (30%); 
systemic  symptoms  of  fatigue  and  malaise  that  are  most  common  in 
children with type I disease; or an acute nephritic picture with RPGN 
and a speedy deterioration in renal function in up to 25% of patients. 
Low serum C3 levels are common. Fifty percent of patients with MPGN 
develop  ESRD  10  years  after  diagnosis,  and  90%  have  renal  insuffi-
ciency  after  20  years.  Nephrotic  syndrome,  hypertension,  and  renal 
insufficiency all predict poor outcome. In the presence of proteinuria,

treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system is prudent. 
Evidence supports the efficacy of treatment of primary MPGN with ste-
roids, particularly in children. There are reports of efficacy with other 
immunosuppressive drugs. If defects in the complement pathway are 
found, treatment with eculizumab is of benefit. In secondary MPGN, 
treating the associated infection, autoimmune disease, or neoplasms is 
of demonstrated benefit. Patients with primary MPGN are well known 
to  be  at  risk  for  not  only  a  histologic  recurrence  in  the  transplanted 
kidney  but  also  a  clinically  significant  recurrence  with  loss  of  graft 
function.

 ■ MESANGIOPROLIFERATIVE 
GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
Mesangioproliferative  glomerulonephritis  is  characterized  by  expan-
sion  of  the  mesangium,  sometimes  associated  with  mesangial  hyper-
cellularity;  thin,  single  contoured  capillary  walls;  and  mesangial 
immune deposits. Mesangioproliferative pathology may be seen in IgA 
nephropathy, Plasmodium falciparum malaria, resolving postinfectious 
glomerulonephritis, and class II nephritis from lupus, all of which can 
have  a  similar  histologic  appearance.  With  these  secondary  entities 
excluded, the diagnosis of primary mesangioproliferative glomerulone-
phritis is made in <15% of renal biopsies.

NEPHROTIC SYNDROME
Nephrotic syndrome classically presents with heavy proteinuria, min-
imal  hematuria,  hypoalbuminemia,  hypercholesterolemia,  edema, 
and  hypertension.  If  left  undiagnosed  or  untreated,  some  of  these 
syndromes will progressively damage enough glomeruli to cause a fall 
in GFR, producing renal failure. Multiple studies have noted that the 
higher the 24-h urine protein excretion, the more rapid is the decline 
in GFR.

Therapies  for  various  causes  of  nephrotic  syndrome  are  noted 
under individual disease headings below. In general, all patients with 
hypercholesterolemia  secondary  to  nephrotic  syndrome  should  be 
treated  with  lipid-lowering  agents  because  they  are  at  increased  risk 
for cardiovascular disease. Edema secondary to salt and water reten-
tion can be controlled with the use of diuretics, avoiding intravascular 
volume depletion. Venous complications secondary to the hypercoag-
ulable  state  associated  with  nephrotic  syndrome  can  be  treated  with 
anticoagulants. The losses of various serum binding proteins, such as 
thyroid-binding globulin, lead to alterations in functional tests. Lastly, 
proteinuria itself is hypothesized to be nephrotoxic, and treatment of 
proteinuria with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system can lower 
urinary protein excretion.

 ■ MINIMAL CHANGE DISEASE
MCD, sometimes known as nil lesion, causes 70–90% of nephrotic syn-
drome in childhood but only 10–15% of nephrotic syndrome in adults. 
MCD usually presents as a primary renal disease but can be associated 
with  several  conditions,  including  Hodgkin’s  disease,  allergies,  use 
of  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  agents  or  lithium,  infections,  and 
other glomerular diseases. MCD on renal biopsy shows no glomerular 
lesion by light microscopy and is negative for deposits by immunofluo-
rescent microscopy or occasionally shows small amounts of IgM in the 
mesangium (see Fig. A4-1). (See Glomerular Schematic 4.) Electron 
microscopy, however, consistently demonstrates an effacement of the 
foot processes supporting the epithelial podocytes with weakening of 
slit-pore membranes. The pathogenesis of this lesion is unclear. Most 
agree there is a disturbance related to T-cell responses, or expression of 
CD80 or CD40/40L may alter capillary charge and podocyte integrity; 
interestingly, the use of checkpoint inhibitors as chemotherapy is asso-
ciated with MCD. There also is some circumstantial evidence for the 
presence of preceding allergies, altered cell-mediated immunity during 
viral infections, and a high frequency of remissions with steroids.

MCD presents clinically with the abrupt onset of edema and neph-
rotic  syndrome  accompanied  by  acellular  urinary  sediment.  Average 
urine protein excretion reported in 24 h is 10 g with severe hypoalbu-
minemia.  Less  common  clinical  features  include  hypertension  (30% 
in children, 50% in adults), microscopic hematuria (20% in children,

33% in adults), atopy or allergic symptoms (40% in children, 30% in 
adults), and decreased renal function (25–40%), which often returns to 
normal after remission of the nephrotic syndrome. The appearance of 
acute renal failure in adults is often seen more commonly in patients 
with  low  serum  albumin  and  intrarenal  edema  (nephrosarca)  that  is 
responsive to diuretics. This presentation must be distinguished from 
acute  renal  failure  secondary  to  hypovolemia.  Acute  tubular  necro-
sis  and  interstitial  inflammation  are  also  reported.  In  children,  the 
abnormal  urine  principally  contains  albumin  with  minimal  amounts 
of  higher-molecular-weight  proteins  and  is  sometimes  called  selective 
proteinuria.  Although  up  to  30%  of  children  have  a  spontaneous 
remission, most children today are treated with steroids; only children 
who are nonresponders are biopsied. Primary responders are patients 
who  have  a  complete  remission  (<0.2  mg/24  h  of  proteinuria),  often 
abruptly after a single course of prednisone; steroid-dependent patients 
relapse as their steroid dose is tapered. Frequent relapsers have two or 
more  relapses  in  the  6  months  following  taper,  and  steroid-resistant 
patients  fail  to  respond  to  steroid  therapy.  Adults  are  not  considered 
steroid-resistant until after 4 months of therapy. Ninety to 95% of chil-
dren will develop a complete remission after 8 weeks of steroid therapy, 
and 80–85% of adults will achieve complete remission, but only after a 
longer course of 20–24 weeks. Patients with steroid resistance may have 
FSGS on repeat biopsy. If the first renal biopsy does not have a sample 
of  deeper  corticomedullary  glomeruli,  then  the  correct  diagnosis  of 
FSGS may be missed.

Relapses occur in 70–75% of children after the first remission, and 
early relapse predicts multiple subsequent relapses, as do high levels of 
basal  proteinuria.  The  frequency  of  relapses  decreases  after  puberty. 
There  is  an  increased  risk  of  relapse  following  the  rapid  tapering  of 
steroids in all groups. Relapses are less common in adults but are more 
resistant to subsequent therapy. Prednisone is first-line therapy, either 
given daily or on alternate days. Other immunosuppressive drugs, such 
as  cyclophosphamide,  chlorambucil,  and  mycophenolate  mofetil,  are 
saved  for  frequent  relapsers,  steroid-dependent  patients,  or  steroid- 
resistant  patients.  Cyclosporine  can  induce  remission,  but  relapse  is 
also common when cyclosporine is withdrawn. The long-term prog-
nosis  in  adults  is  less  favorable  when  acute  renal  failure  or  steroid 
resistance occurs.
 ■ FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS
FSGS  refers  to  a  pattern  of  renal  injury  characterized  by  segmental 
glomerular  scars  that  involve  some  but  not  all  glomeruli  (focal);  the 
clinical  findings  of  FSGS  largely  manifest  as  proteinuria.  When  the 
secondary  and  genetic  causes  of  FSGS  are  eliminated  (Table  314-5), 
the  remaining  patients  are  considered  to  have  primary  FSGS.  The 
incidence of this disease is increasing, and it now represents up to one-
third of cases of nephrotic syndrome in adults and one-half of cases of

nephrotic syndrome in African Americans. The pathogenesis of FSGS 
has multiple possible mechanisms including a circulating permeability 
factor, an adaptive response to glomerular hypertrophy or hyperfiltra-
tion, and podocyte abnormalities associated with direct toxic injury or 
genetic mutations. Risk polymorphisms at the APOL1 locus expressed 
in  podocytes  substantially  explain  the  increased  burden  of  FSGS 
among African Americans.

The pathologic changes of FSGS are most prominent in glomeruli 
located at the corticomedullary junction (see Fig. A4-2), so if the renal 
biopsy specimen is from superficial tissue, the lesions can be missed, 
which sometimes leads to a misdiagnosis of MCD. In addition to focal 
and segmental scarring, other variants have been described, including 
cellular  lesions  with  endocapillary  hypercellularity  and  heavy  pro-
teinuria; collapsing glomerulopathy (see Fig. A4-3) with segmental or 
global glomerular collapse and a rapid decline in renal function; a hilar 
stalk lesion (see Fig. A4-4); or the glomerular tip lesion (see Fig. A4-5), 
which may have a better prognosis. (See Glomerular Schematic 5.)

FSGS  can  present  with  hematuria,  hypertension,  any  level  of 
proteinuria,  and  renal  insufficiency.  Nephrotic-range  proteinuria, 
African-American  race,  and  renal  insufficiency  are  associated  with  a 
poor outcome, with 50% of patients reaching renal failure in 6–8 years. 
FSGS  rarely  remits  spontaneously,  but  treatment-induced  remission 
of proteinuria significantly improves prognosis. Treatment of patients 
with FSGS should include inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. 
Patients with primary FSGS with nephrotic-range proteinuria can be 
treated with steroids but respond far less often and after a longer course 
of therapy than patients with MCD. Proteinuria remits in only 20–45% 
of  patients  receiving  a  course  of  steroids  over  6–12  months.  Limited 
evidence suggests the use of cyclosporine in steroid-responsive patients 
helps  ensure  remissions.  Relapse  frequently  occurs  after  cessation  of 
cyclosporine therapy, and cyclosporine itself can lead to a deterioration 
of renal function due to its nephrotoxic effects. A role for other agents 
that suppress the immune system such as rituximab or mycophenolate 
mofetil  has  not  been  established.  Immunosuppressive  therapy  is  not 
indicated in secondary or genetic FSGS. FSGS recurs in 30% of renal 
transplants, more commonly in primary FSGS, less commonly in sec-
ondary FSGS, and rarely in genetic FSGS. In recurrent posttransplant 
FSGS, many patients will achieve a full or partial remission with plas-
mapheresis. The treatment of secondary FSGS typically involves treat-
ing the underlying cause and controlling proteinuria. There is no role 
for steroids or other immunosuppressive agents in secondary FSGS.

 ■ MEMBRANOUS GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
MGN, or membranous nephropathy as it is sometimes called, accounts 
for ~25% of cases of nephrotic syndrome in adults, with a peak inci-
dence between the ages of 30 and 50 years and a male-to-female ratio of 
2:1. IMN is rare in childhood and the most common cause of nephrotic 
syndrome in the elderly. In 20–30% of cases, MGN is secondary and is 
associated with a malignancy (solid tumors of the breast, lung, colon), 
infection  (hepatitis  B,  syphilis,  malaria,  schistosomiasis),  rheumato-
logic disorders such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, IgG4 diseases, or 
drug exposure (Table 314-6).

Uniform thickening of the basement membrane along the periph-
eral  capillary  loops  is  seen  by  light  microscopy  on  renal  biopsy  (see 
Fig.  A4-7);  this  thickening  needs  to  be  distinguished  from  that  seen 
in  diabetes  and  amyloidosis.  (See  Glomerular  Schematic  6.)  Immu-
nofluorescence demonstrates diffuse granular deposits of IgG and C3,

and electron microscopy typically reveals electron-dense subepithelial 
deposits.  While  different  stages  (I–V)  of  progressive  membranous 
lesions  have  been  described,  some  published  analyses  indicate  the 
degree  of  tubular  atrophy  or  interstitial  fibrosis  is  more  predictive 
of  progression  than  is  the  stage  of  glomerular  disease.  The  presence 
of  subendothelial  deposits  or  the  presence  of  tubuloreticular  inclu-
sions  strongly  points  to  a  diagnosis  of  membranous  lupus  nephritis, 
which may precede the extrarenal manifestations of lupus. In 70% of 
cases  of  IMN,  autoantibodies  against  the  M-type  phospholipase  A2

2344 receptor circulate and bind to a conformational epitope present in the 
PLA2R on human podocytes, producing characteristic in situ depos-
its.  Three  to  10%  of  IMN  patients  alternatively  have  autoantibodies 
to  thrombospondin  type-1  domain  containing  7A  (THSD7A).  Both 
antigens co-localize within glomerular subepithelial deposits with IgG4 
(PLA2R).  Other  renal  diseases  do  not  involve  these  autoantibodies. 
In  most  cases  of  secondary  membranous  nephropathy,  these  auto-
antibodies  are  absent,  with  rare  reports  of  autoantibodies  to  PLA2R 
in  membranous  glomerulopathy  associated  with  hepatitis  B,  cancer, 
and sarcoidosis. Circulating deposits and glomerular deposits of these 
autoantibodies  have  correlated  with  the  likelihood  of  a  spontaneous 
remission, severity of IMN, and the response to therapy. Eighty percent 
of  patients  with  MGN  present  with  nephrotic  syndrome  and  nonse-
lective proteinuria. Microscopic hematuria is seen but less commonly 
than  in  IgA  nephropathy  or  FSGS.  Spontaneous  remissions  occur  in 
20–33%  of  patients  and  often  occur  late  in  the  course,  which  makes 
treatment  decisions  difficult.  One-third  of  patients  continue  to  have 
relapsing  nephrotic  syndrome  but  maintain  normal  renal  function, 
and approximately another third of patients develop renal failure or die 
from the complications of nephrotic syndrome. Male gender, older age, 
hypertension,  and  the  persistence  of  nephrotic-range  proteinuria  are 
associated with worse prognosis. Although thrombotic complications 
are a feature of all nephrotic syndromes, MGN has the highest reported 
incidences of renal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and deep- 
vein thrombosis. Prophylactic anticoagulation is controversial but has 
been recommended for patients with hypoalbuminemia.

In  addition  to  the  treatment  of  edema,  dyslipidemia,  and  hyper-
tension,  inhibition  of  the  renin-angiotensin  system  is  recommended. 
Therapy  with  immunosuppressive  drugs  is  also  recommended  for 
patients with primary MGN and persistent proteinuria (>3.0 g/24 h). 
The  choice  of  immunosuppressive  drugs  for  therapy  is  controversial, 
but current recommendations are to treat with steroids and cyclophos-
phamide, chlorambucil, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclosporine or rit-
uximab, an anti-CD20 antibody directed at B cells. Attaining remission 
is associated with a good long-term prognosis.

 ■ DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY
Diabetic  nephropathy  is  the  single  most  common  cause  of  chronic 
renal failure in the United States and worldwide. The dramatic increase 
in the number of patients with diabetic nephropathy reflects the epi-
demic increase in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approximately 
40%  of  patients  with  diabetes  develop  nephropathy,  but  due  to  the 
higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (90%) compared to type 1 (10%), 
the majority of patients with diabetic nephropathy have type 2 disease. 
Renal lesions are more common in African-American, Native-American, 
Polynesian, and Maori populations. Risk factors for the development 
of diabetic nephropathy include hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslip-
idemia,  smoking,  a  family  history  of  diabetic  nephropathy,  and  gene 
polymorphisms.

Within  1–2  years  after  the  onset  of  clinical  diabetes,  morphologic 
changes  appear  in  the  kidney.  Thickening  of  the  GBM  is  a  sensitive 
indicator  for  the  presence  of  diabetes  but  correlates  poorly  with  the 
presence or absence of nephropathy. The composition of the GBM is 
altered  notably  with  a  loss  of  heparan  sulfate  moieties  that  form  the 
negatively charged filtration barrier resulting in increased filtration of 
serum proteins into the urine. The expansion of the mesangium due 
to the accumulation of extracellular matrix correlates with the clinical 
manifestations  of  diabetic  nephropathy  (see  stages  in  Fig.  A4-20). 
This expansion in mesangial matrix is associated with the development 
of  mesangial  sclerosis.  Some  patients  also  develop  eosinophilic,  PAS+ 
nodules called  nodular glomerulosclerosis or  Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules. 
Immunofluorescence microscopy often reveals the nonspecific depo-
sition  of  IgG  (at  times  in  a  linear  pattern)  or  complement  staining 
without immune deposits on electron microscopy. Prominent vascular 
changes are frequently seen with hyaline and hypertensive arterioscle-
rosis.  This  is  associated  with  varying  degrees  of  chronic  glomerulo-
sclerosis  and  tubulointerstitial  changes.  Renal  biopsies  from  patients 
with types 1 and 2 diabetic nephropathies with albuminuria are largely 
indistinguishable.  Patients  with  type  2  diabetes  without  albuminuria 

are classified as having diabetic kidney disease as opposed to diabetic 
nephropathy and may have myriad pathologic findings.

Multiple lines of evidence support an important role for changes in 
glomerular hemodynamics including increases in glomerular capillary 
pressure  and  glomerular  hyperfiltration  in  these  pathologic  changes. 
Hyperglycemia  activates  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system 
and also alters insulin-like growth factor, reactive oxygen species, and 
endothelin 1. Diabetes upregulates the sodium-glucose cotransporters 
(SGLT1  and  SGLT2)  in  the  proximal  tubule,  resulting  in  decreased 
distal delivery of sodium to the macula densa and further glomerular 
hyperfiltration.  Sustained  glomerular  hypertension  increases  matrix 
production and alterations in the GBM with disruption in the filtration 
barrier.  Other  factors  that  alter  matrix  production  include  the  accu-
mulation  of  advanced  glycosylation  end  products,  circulating  factors 
including  growth  hormone,  connective  tissue  growth  factor,  TGF-β, 
and dyslipidemia.

The  natural  history  of  diabetic  nephropathy  has  been  historically 
well  characterized  in  the  ~40%  of  diabetics  who  develop  it  as  a  pro-
gression  from  glomerular  hyperfiltration  and  renal  hypertrophy  to 
increasing  albuminuria  followed  by  declining  GFR  and  ESRD.  How-
ever, since the onset of type 1 diabetes is readily identifiable and the 
onset of type 2 diabetes is not, a patient newly diagnosed with type 2 
diabetes may present with advanced diabetic nephropathy. Albuminuria 
and decreased GFR are potent risk factors for cardiovascular disease, 
with some patients dying before they reach ESRD. Furthermore, con-
temporary studies reveal that up to 24% of patients with type 1 diabetes 
and 50% with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease may be nor-
moalbuminuric.  It  is  unknown  whether  this  alteration  in  the  natural 
history  reflects  contemporary  effective  interventions  or  perhaps 
other kidney diseases that happen to occur in patients with diabetes. 
The  degree  of  early  glomerular  hyperfiltration  does  correlate  with  the 
development of albuminuria and declining GFR. Albuminuria in the 
range  of  30–300  mg/24  h  is  called  microalbuminuria  (Table  314-1). 
Microalbuminuria appears 5–10 years after the onset of diabetes. It is 
currently recommended to test patients with type 1 disease for microal-
buminuria 5 years after diagnosis of diabetes and yearly thereafter and, 
because the time of onset of type 2 diabetes is often unknown, to test 
type 2 patients at the time of diagnosis of diabetes and yearly thereafter. 
Microalbuminuria classically progresses over 5–10 years to proteinuria 
and  declining  GFR,  but  in  contemporary  studies,  greater  heteroge-
neity  is  reported  with  regression  to  normoalbuminuria;  however, 
albuminuria  remains  the  single  most  important  predictor  of  a  faster 
decline in GFR. Regression of albuminuria with a treatment interven-
tion  is  a  good  prognostic  sign.  Proteinuria  in  diabetic  nephropathy 
can be variable, ranging from 500 mg to 25 g/24 h. More than 90% of 
patients with type 1 diabetes and nephropathy have diabetic retinop-
athy, so the absence of retinopathy in type 1 patients with proteinuria 
should prompt consideration of a diagnosis other than diabetic neph-
ropathy; only 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy 
have  diabetic  retinopathy.  There  is  a  significant  correlation  between 
the  presence  of  retinopathy  and  the  presence  of  Kimmelstiel-Wilson 
nodules (see Fig. A4-20). Even with advanced chronic kidney disease, 
patients with diabetic nephropathy will have enlarged kidneys. Using 
the above data, and in the absence of other clinical or serologic data 
suggesting another disease, diabetic nephropathy is usually diagnosed 
without a renal biopsy. The risk of progression to ESRD is influenced 
by treatment and other risk factors, and reports vary from a decline of 
1.8–14 mL/min per year. Survival on dialysis is worse for patients with 
diabetes. Renal transplantation results in better survival than dialysis.
Good evidence supports the benefits of blood sugar and blood pres-
sure  control,  inhibitors  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system 
(RAAS), and inhibitors of SGLT2 in retarding the progression of dia-
betic nephropathy. In patients with type 1 diabetes, intensive control of 
blood sugar clearly prevents the development or progression of diabetic 
nephropathy. The evidence for benefit of intensive blood glucose con-
trol in patients with type 2 diabetes is less certain, with current studies 
reporting conflicting results.

Controlling systemic blood pressure decreases renal and cardiovas-
cular adverse events in this high-risk population. The vast majority of

patients  with  diabetic  nephropathy  require  three  or  more  antihyper-
tensive drugs to achieve this goal. Drugs that inhibit the RAAS (ACE 
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), independent of their 
effects on systemic blood pressure, have been shown in large clinical 
trials to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy at early (microal-
buminuria)  and  late  (proteinuria  with  reduced  glomerular  filtration) 
stages.  Evidence  suggests  increased  risk  for  cardiovascular  adverse 
events  without  increased  efficacy  in  patients  with  a  combination  of 
two  drugs  (ACE  inhibitors,  ARBs,  or  renin  inhibitors)  that  suppress 
several components of the RAAS. In patients with type 2 diabetes and 
kidney  disease  with  albuminuria,  the  risk  of  kidney  failure  and  car-
diovascular events was lower in those receiving SGLT2 in addition to 
inhibitors of the RAAS. Ongoing trials are examining the hypotheses 
that other agents may be of benefit, including endothelin antagonists 
and aldosterone antagonists.
 ■ GLOMERULAR DEPOSITION DISEASES
Plasma  cell  dyscrasias  producing  excess  light  chain  immunoglobulin 
sometimes  lead  to  the  formation  of  glomerular  and  tubular  deposits 
that cause heavy proteinuria and renal failure; the same is true for the 
accumulation  of  serum  amyloid  A  protein  fragments  seen  in  several 
inflammatory  diseases.  This  broad  group  of  proteinuric  patients  has 
glomerular deposition disease.
Light  Chain  Deposition  Disease  The  biochemical  character-
istics  of  nephrotoxic  light  chains  produced  in  patients  with  light 
chain malignancies confer renal injury; that of either cast nephrop-
athy  (see Fig. A4-17),  which  causes  renal  failure  but  not  heavy  pro-
teinuria  or  amyloidosis,  or  light  chain  deposition  disease  (LCDD) 
(see  Fig.  A4-16),  which  produces  proteinuria  with  renal  failure. 
These latter patients produce kappa light chains that do not have the 
biochemical  features  necessary  to  form  amyloid  fibrils.  Instead,  they 
self-aggregate  and  form  granular  deposits  along  the  glomerular  cap-
illary and mesangium or, more prominently, in the tubular basement 
membrane and Bowman’s capsule. Light chain deposits are not fibrillar 
and do not stain with Congo red, but they are easily detected with anti–
light chain antibody. A combination of the light chain rearrangement, 
self-aggregating  properties  at  neutral  pH,  and  abnormal  metabolism 
probably contributes to the deposition.
Monoclonal  Plasma  Cell  Disorders  Multiple  myeloma,  Wal-
denström’s macroglobulinemia, or lymphoma may be present, as well 
as  heart,  liver,  and  pulmonary  involvement.  The  monoclonal  protein 
may  be  found  with  serum  electrophoresis  or  with  serum  free  light 
chain analysis. Nephrotic syndrome may develop, and ~70% of patients 
progress to dialysis. Treatment for LCDD is treatment of the primary 
disease  and,  if  possible,  autologous  stem  cell  transplantation.  Rarely, 
truncated heavy chains similarly cause nonamyloid deposits.
Renal Amyloidosis  Most renal amyloidosis is either the result of 
primary  fibrillar  deposits  of  immunoglobulin  light  chains  known  as 
amyloid L (AL) or secondary to fibrillar deposits of serum amyloid A 
(AA) protein fragments (Chap. 112). Even though both occur for dif-
ferent reasons, their clinicopathophysiology is quite similar. Amyloid 
infiltrates the liver, heart, peripheral nerves, carpal tunnel, upper phar-
ynx, and kidney, producing restrictive cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, 
macroglossia, and heavy proteinuria sometimes associated with renal 
vein  thrombosis.  In  contrast  to  LCDD,  amyloid  renal  deposits  are 
fibrillar, stain with Congo red, and contain predominantly the variable 
region of lambda chains (see Fig. A4-15). In systemic AL amyloidosis, 
also  called  primary  amyloidosis,  light  chains  produced  in  excess  by 
clonal plasma cell dyscrasias are made into fragments by macrophages 
so they can self-aggregate at acid pH. Approximately 10% of patients 
have overt myeloma as defined by CRAB (hypercalcemia, renal insuffi-
ciency, anemia, or lytic bone lesions). Nephrotic syndrome is common, 
and ~20% of patients progress to dialysis. AA amyloidosis is sometimes 
called secondary amyloidosis and also presents as nephrotic syndrome. 
It is due to deposition of β-pleated sheets of serum amyloid A protein, 
an  acute  phase  reactant.  Patients  with  AA  amyloid  have  associated 
inflammatory  diseases  including  rheumatoid  arthritis,  ankylosing 
spondylitis,  psoriatic  arthritis,  juvenile  inflammatory  arthritis,  and 

familial  Mediterranean  fever.  An  increasing  proportion  of  patients 
have unidentified chronic inflammation; this may reflect better treat-
ments for the previously associated diseases or a rise in chronic inflam-
mation due to obesity. Fragments of serum amyloid A protein increase 
and self-aggregate by attaching to receptors for advanced glycation end 
products in the extracellular environment; nephrotic syndrome is com-
mon,  and  ~40–60%  of  patient’s  progress  to  dialysis.  Serum-free  light 
chain analysis is useful in the early diagnosis and follow-up of disease 
progression. Biopsy of involved liver or kidney is diagnostic 90% of the 
time when the pretest probability is high; abdominal fat pad aspirates 
are  positive  ~70%  of  the  time,  but  apparently  less  so  when  looking 
for AA amyloid. Amyloid deposits are distributed along blood vessels 
and in the mesangial regions of the kidney. The treatment for primary 
amyloidosis, melphalan, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plantation (HCT) can delay the course of disease. Patients who are not 
candidates  for  HCT  often  receive  bortezomib-based  regimens.  Sec-
ondary amyloidosis is also relentless unless the primary disease can be 
controlled. Some new drugs in development that disrupt the formation 
of fibrils may be available in the future.
Fibrillary  and  Immunotactoid  Glomerulopathies  Fibrillary 
and  immunotactoid  glomerulopathies  are  rare  (<1.0%  of  renal  biop-
sies),  morphologically  defined  diseases  characterized  by  glomerular 
accumulation  of  nonbranching  randomly  arranged  fibrils  that  are 
Congo  red  negative.  Fibrillary  glomerulopathy  accounts  for  85–90% 
of  cases  and  is  identified  by  the  presence  of  the  protein  DnaJ  heat 
shock protein family B9 (DNAJB9) in the glomeruli, which is absent 
in the rarer immunotactoid glomerulopathy. In both, glomerular and 
mesangial deposits contain oligoclonal or oligotypic immunoglobulins 
and complement, with 12- to 24-nm fibrils in fibrillary glomerulopathy 
and  >30-nm  fibrils  organized  into  microtubules  in  immunotactoid 
glomerulopathy.  The  cause  of  this  “nonamyloid”  glomerulopathy  is 
mostly  idiopathic;  reports  of  fibrillary  glomerulonephritis  describe 
associations  with  malignancy,  autoimmune  disease,  and  monoclonal 
gammopathy,  and  immunotactoid  glomerulopathy  has  been  associ-
ated with lymphoma or plasma cell disorders. Both disorders appear 
in  adults  aged  40–80  years  old,  with  moderate  to  heavy  proteinuria 
(100%), hematuria (70%), renal insufficiency (50%), and a wide variety 
of histologic lesions, including DPGN, MPGN, MGN, or mesangiopro-
liferative glomerulonephritis. Most patients have disease limited to the 
kidney.  Patients  should  be  screened  for  associated  disorders.  Half  of 
patients develop renal failure over a few years. There is no consensus 
on treatment of this uncommon disorder, although rituximab has been 
reported  to  remit  proteinuria.  These  diseases  can  recur  in  the  renal 
transplant.
 ■ FABRY’S DISEASE
Fabry’s  disease  is  an  X-linked  inborn  error  of  globotriaosylcera-
mide metabolism secondary to deficient lysosomal α-galactosidase A 
(alpha-Gal  A)  activity,  resulting  in  excessive  intracellular  storage  of 
globotriaosylceramide. Affected organs include the vascular endothe-
lium, heart, brain, and kidneys. Classically, Fabry’s disease presents in 
childhood in males with acroparesthesias, angiokeratoma, cornea ver-
ticillate, and hypohidrosis. Over time, male patients develop cardiomy-
opathy, cerebrovascular disease, and renal injury, with an average age 
of death around 50 years of age. Hemizygotes with hypomorphic muta-
tions sometimes present in the fourth to sixth decade with single-organ 
involvement.  Rarely,  dominant-negative  alpha-Gal  A  mutations  or 
female  heterozygotes  with  unfavorable  X  inactivation  present  with 
mild single-organ involvement. Rare females develop severe manifes-
tations including renal failure but do so later in life than males. Renal 
biopsy reveals enlarged glomerular visceral epithelial cells packed with 
small clear vacuoles containing globotriaosylceramide; vacuoles  may 
also  be  found  in  parietal  and  tubular  epithelia  (see  Fig.  A4-18). 
These  vacuoles  of  electron-dense  materials  in  parallel  arrays  (zebra 
bodies)  are  easily  seen  on  electron  microscopy.  Ultimately,  renal 
biopsies  reveal  FSGS.  The  nephropathy  of  Fabry’s  disease  typically 
presents  in  the  third  decade  as  mild  to  moderate  proteinuria,  some-
times with microscopic hematuria or nephrotic syndrome. Urinalysis 
may reveal oval fat bodies and birefringent glycolipid globules under

2346 polarized  light  (Maltese  cross).  Measurement  of  alpha-Gal  A  activity 
and mutational analysis of the gene is diagnostic, with renal biopsies 
sometimes  helpful.  Progression  to  renal  failure  occurs  by  the  fourth 
or  fifth  decade.  Treatment  with  inhibitors  of  the  renin-angiotensin 
system is recommended. Treatment with recombinant alpha-Gal A or 
migalastat, a chaperone that facilitates trafficking of alpha-Gal A, clears 
microvascular endothelial deposits of globotriaosylceramide from the 
kidneys, heart, and skin. In patients with advanced organ involvement 
including chronic kidney disease, progression of disease occurs despite 
enzyme  replacement  therapy.  Variable  responses  to  enzyme  therapy 
may be due to the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies or differences 
in  uptake  of  the  enzyme.  Graft  and  patient  survival  following  renal 
transplantation in patients with Fabry’s disease are similar to those of 
other causes of ESRD.

PULMONARY-RENAL SYNDROMES
Several diseases can present with catastrophic hemoptysis and glom-
erulonephritis  associated  with  varying  degrees  of  renal  failure.  The 
usual  causes  include  Goodpasture’s  syndrome,  granulomatosis  with 
polyangiitis,  microscopic  polyangiitis,  Churg-Strauss  vasculitis,  and, 
rarely,  Henoch-Schönlein  purpura  or  cryoglobulinemia.  Each  of  these 
diseases can also present without hemoptysis and are discussed in detail 
earlier in “Acute Nephritic Syndromes.” (See Glomerular Schematic 7.) 
Pulmonary bleeding in this setting is life-threatening and often results in 
airway intubation, and acute renal failure requires dialysis. Diagnosis is 
difficult initially because biopsies and serologic testing take time. Treat-
ment  with  plasmapheresis  and  methylprednisolone  is  often  empirical 
and temporizing until results of testing are available.

BASEMENT MEMBRANE SYNDROMES
All  kidney  epithelia,  including  podocytes,  rest  on  basement  mem-
branes assembled into a planar surface through the interweaving of col-
lagen IV with laminins, nidogen, and sulfated proteoglycans. Structural 

abnormalities  in  GBM  associated  with  hematuria  are  characteristic 
of  several  familial  disorders  related  to  the  expression  of  collagen  IV 
genes. The extended family of collagen IV contains six chains, which 
are  expressed  in  different  tissues  at  different  stages  of  embryonic 
development.  All  epithelial  basement  membranes  early  in  human 
development  are  composed  of  interconnected  triple-helical  protom-
ers rich in α1.α1.α2(IV) collagen. Some specialized tissues undergo a 
developmental switch replacing α1.α1.α2(IV) protomers with an α3.α4.
α5(IV) collagen network; this switch occurs in the kidney (glomerular 
and tubular basement membrane), lung, testis, cochlea, and eye, while 
an α5.α5.α6(IV) network appears in skin, smooth muscle, and esoph-
agus and along Bowman’s capsule in the kidney. This switch probably 
occurs because the α3.α4.α5(IV) network is more resistant to proteases 
and ensures the structural longevity of critical tissues. When basement 
membranes are the target of glomerular disease, they produce moder-
ate proteinuria, some hematuria, and progressive renal failure.
 ■ ANTI-GBM DISEASE
Autoimmune disease where antibodies are directed against the α3 NC1 
domain of collagen IV produces an anti-GBM disease often associated 
with  RPGN  and/or  a  pulmonary-renal  syndrome  called  Goodpas-
ture’s syndrome. Discussion of this disease is covered earlier in “Acute 
Nephritic Syndromes.”

 ■ ALPORT’S SYNDROME
Classically, patients with Alport’s syndrome develop hematuria, thin-
ning and splitting of the GBMs, and mild proteinuria (<1–2 g/24 h), 
which appears late in the course, followed by chronic glomerulosclero-
sis leading to renal failure in association with sensorineural deafness. 
Some patients develop lenticonus of the anterior lens capsule, “dot and 
fleck” retinopathy, and rarely, leiomyomatosis. Approximately 85% of 
patients with Alport’s syndrome have an X-linked inheritance of muta-
tions in the α5(IV) collagen chain on chromosome Xq22–24. Female

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractcarriers have variable penetrance depending on the type of mutation 
or the degree of mosaicism created by X inactivation. Fifteen percent 
of  patients  have  autosomal  recessive  disease  of  the  α3(IV)  or  α4(IV) 
chains on chromosome 2q35–37. Rarely, some kindred have an auto-
somal dominant inheritance of dominant-negative mutations in α3(IV) 
or α4(IV) chains.

Pedigrees  with  the  X-linked  syndrome  are  quite  variable  in  their 
rate and frequency of tissue damage leading to organ failure. Seventy 
percent of patients have the juvenile form with nonsense or missense 
mutations,  reading  frame  shifts,  or  large  deletions  and  generally 
develop  renal  failure  and  sensorineural  deafness  by  age  30.  Patients 
with splice variants, exon skipping, or missense mutations of α-helical 
glycines  generally  deteriorate  after  the  age  of  30  (adult  form)  with 
mild or late deafness. Early severe deafness, lenticonus, or proteinuria 
suggests a poorer prognosis. Usually females from X-linked pedigrees 
have only microhematuria, but up to 25% of carrier females have been 
reported to have more severe renal manifestations. Pedigrees with the 
autosomal  recessive  form  of  the  disease  have  severe  early  disease  in 
both females and males with asymptomatic parents.

Clinical  evaluation  should  include  a  careful  eye  examination  and 
hearing tests. However, the absence of extrarenal symptoms does not 
rule out the diagnosis. Since α5(IV) collagen is expressed in the skin, 
some X-linked Alport’s patients can be diagnosed with a skin biopsy 
revealing  the  lack  of  the  α5(IV)  collagen  chain  on  immunofluores-
cent  analysis.  Patients  with  mutations  in  α3(IV)  or  α4(IV)  require  a 
renal biopsy. Genetic testing can be used for the diagnosis of Alport’s 
syndrome  and  the  demonstration  of  the  mode  of  inheritance.  Early 
in their disease, Alport’s patients typically have thin basement mem-
branes on renal biopsy (see Fig. A4-19), which thicken over time into 
multilamellations surrounding lucent areas that often contain granules 
of  varying  density—the  so-called  split  basement  membrane.  In  any 
Alport’s kidney, there are areas of thinning mixed with splitting of the 
GBM.  Tubules  drop  out,  glomeruli  scar,  and  the  kidney  eventually 
succumbs to interstitial fibrosis. All affected members of a family with 
X-linked Alport’s syndrome should be identified and followed, includ-
ing mothers of affected males. Primary treatment is control of systemic 
hypertension  and  use  of  ACE  inhibitors  to  slow  renal  progression. 
Although  patients  who  receive  renal  allografts  usually  develop  anti-
GBM antibodies directed toward the collagen epitopes absent in their 
native kidney, overt Goodpasture’s syndrome is rare and graft survival 
is good.

 ■ THIN BASEMENT MEMBRANE DISEASE
Thin  basement  membrane  disease  (TBMD),  a  relatively  common 
disorder  characterized  by  persistent  or  intermittent,  asymptomatic, 
usually  microscopic  hematuria  and  rarely  macroscopic  hematuria 
with  flank  pain,  is  not  typically  associated  with  proteinuria,  hyper-
tension, or loss of renal function or extrarenal disease. TBMD is often 
familial, with pedigrees exhibiting an autosomal dominant pattern. It 
usually presents in childhood in multiple family members and is also 
called  benign  familial  hematuria.  Many  cases  of  TBMD  have  genetic 
defects in type IV collagen, but in contrast to Alport’s syndrome, the 
disease  behaves  as  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder  that  in  ~40%  of 
families  segregates  with  the  COL(IV)  α3/COL(IV)  α4  loci.  Mutations 
in these loci can result in a spectrum of disease, ranging from TBMD 
to autosomal dominant or recessive Alport’s. The GBM shows diffuse 
thinning compared to normal values for the patient’s age in otherwise 
normal biopsies (see Fig. A4-19). The vast majority of patients have a 
benign course.

 ■ NAIL-PATELLA SYNDROME
Patients  with  nail-patella  syndrome  develop  iliac  horns  on  the  pelvis 
and  dysplasia  of  the  dorsal  limbs  involving  the  patella,  elbows,  and 
nails,  variably  associated  with  neural-sensory  hearing  impairment, 
glaucoma,  and  abnormalities  of  the  GBM  and  podocytes,  leading  to 
hematuria, proteinuria, and FSGS. The syndrome is autosomal domi-
nant, with haploinsufficiency for the LIM homeodomain transcription 
factor LMX1B; pedigrees are extremely variable in the penetrance for 
all  features  of  the  disease.  LMX1B  regulates  the  expression  of  genes 

2347

encoding α3 and α4 chains of collagen IV, interstitial type III collagen, 
podocin, and CD2AP that help form the slit-pore membranes connect-
ing podocytes. Mutations in the LIM domain region of LMX1B associ-
ate with glomerulopathy in 30–40% of patients and rarely progress to 
renal failure. Proteinuria or isolated hematuria is discovered through-
out life but usually by the third decade. On renal biopsy, pathognomic 
rarefications  containing  clusters  of  collagen  fibrils  within  the  lamina 
densa of the GBM are found, and FSGS may be present. Treatment is 
nonspecific, but renin-angiotensin system inhibition is recommended. 
Patients with renal failure do well with transplantation.

 ■ GLOMERULAR-VASCULAR SYNDROMES
A variety of diseases result in classic vascular injury to the glomerular 
capillaries.  Most  of  these  processes  also  damage  blood  vessels  else-
where in the body. The group of diseases discussed here lead to vascu-
litis, renal endothelial injury, thrombosis, ischemia, and/or lipid-based 
occlusions.

ATHEROSCLEROTIC NEPHROPATHY
Aging in the developed world is commonly associated with the occlu-
sion  of  coronary  and  systemic  blood  vessels.  The  reasons  for  this 
include  obesity,  insulin  resistance,  smoking,  hypertension,  and  diets 
rich in lipids that deposit in the arterial and arteriolar circulation, pro-
ducing local inflammation and fibrosis of small blood vessels. When 
the renal arterial circulation is involved, the glomerular microcircula-
tion is damaged, leading to chronic nephrosclerosis. Patients with GFRs 
<60 mL/min have more cardiovascular events and hospitalizations than 
those with higher filtration rates. Several aggressive lipid disorders can 
accelerate this process, but most of the time, atherosclerotic progres-
sion  to  chronic  nephrosclerosis  is  associated  with  poorly  controlled 
hypertension. Approximately 10% of glomeruli are normally sclerotic 
by  age  40,  rising  to  20%  by  age  60  and  30%  by  age  80.  Serum  lipid 
profiles  in  humans  are  greatly  affected  by  apolipoprotein  E  polymor-
phisms; the E4 allele is accompanied by increases in serum cholesterol 
and is more closely associated with atherogenic profiles in patients with 
renal failure. Mutations in E2 alleles, particularly in Japanese patients, 
produce a specific renal abnormality called lipoprotein glomerulopathy 
associated with glomerular lipoprotein thrombi and capillary dilation.

 ■ HYPERTENSIVE NEPHROSCLEROSIS
Systemic  hypertension  causes  permanent  damage  to  the  kidneys  in 
~6%  of  patients  with  elevated  blood  pressure.  As  many  as  27%  of 
patients  with  end-stage  kidney  disease  have  hypertension  as  a  pri-
mary  cause,  and  it  is  the  second  most  common  cause  of  ESRD  after 
diabetic  nephropathy.  Hypertensive  nephrosclerosis  is  fivefold  more 
frequent  in  African  Americans  than  whites.  Risk  alleles  associated 
with  APOL1,  a  functional  gene  for  apolipoprotein  L1  expressed  in 
podocytes, substantially explain the increased burden of ESRD among 
African Americans. Associated risk factors for progression to end-stage 
kidney  disease  include  increased  age,  male  gender,  race,  smoking, 
hypercholesterolemia, duration of hypertension, low birth weight, and 
preexisting renal injury. Kidney biopsies in patients with hypertension, 
microhematuria, and moderate proteinuria demonstrate arterioloscle-
rosis, chronic nephrosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis in the absence of 
immune deposits (see Fig. A4-21). Based on a careful history, physical 
examination,  urinalysis,  and  some  serologic  testing,  the  diagnosis  of 
chronic  nephrosclerosis  is  usually  inferred  without  a  biopsy.  Recent 
studies  suggest,  in  the  absence  of  diabetes,  adults  with  hypertension 
and cardiovascular risk factors benefit from achieving a systolic blood 
pressure  <120  mmHg,  compared  to  <140  mmHg.  In  the  presence  of 
kidney disease, most patients begin antihypertensive therapy with two 
drugs, classically a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor; most will 
require  three  drugs.  There  is  strong  evidence  in  African  Americans 
with hypertensive nephrosclerosis that therapy initiated with an ACE 
inhibitor can slow the rate of decline in renal function independent of 
effects on systemic blood pressure. Malignant acceleration of hyperten-
sion complicates the course of chronic nephrosclerosis, particularly in 
the setting of scleroderma or cocaine use (see Fig. A4-24). The hemo-
dynamic stress of malignant hypertension leads to fibrinoid necrosis of 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2347

20/01/22   8:49 PM

 
 
2348 small blood vessels, thrombotic microangiography, a nephritic urinal-
ysis, and acute renal failure. In the setting of renal failure, chest pain, 
or papilledema, the condition is treated as a hypertensive emergency.

 ■ CHOLESTEROL EMBOLI
Aging patients with clinical complications from atherosclerosis some-
times shower cholesterol crystals into the circulation, either spontane-
ously or, more commonly, following an endovascular procedure with 
manipulation  of  the  aorta  or  with  use  of  systemic  anticoagulation. 
Spontaneous  emboli  may  shower  acutely  or  shower  subacutely  and 
somewhat more silently. Irregular emboli trapped in the microcircula-
tion produce ischemic damage that induces an inflammatory reaction. 
Depending  on  the  location  of  the  atherosclerotic  plaques  releasing 
these  cholesterol  fragments,  one  may  see  cerebral  transient  ischemic 
attacks; livedo reticularis in the lower extremities; Hollenhorst plaques 
in the retina with visual field cuts; necrosis of the toes; and acute glo-
merular  capillary  injury  leading  to  FSGS  sometimes  associated  with 
hematuria, mild proteinuria, and loss of renal function, which typically 
progresses  over  a  few  years.  Occasional  patients  have  fever,  eosino-
philia,  or  eosinophiluria.  A  skin  biopsy  of  an  involved  area  may  be 
diagnostic. Since tissue fixation dissolves the cholesterol, one typically 
sees only residual, biconvex clefts in involved vessels (see Fig. A4-22). 
There is no therapy to reverse embolic occlusions, and steroids do not 
help. Controlling blood pressure and lipids and cessation of smoking 
are usually recommended for prevention.

 ■ SICKLE CELL DISEASE
Although individuals with SA-hemoglobin are usually asymptomatic, 
most will gradually develop hyposthenuria due to subclinical infarction 
of  the  renal  medulla,  thus  predisposing  them  to  volume  depletion. 
There  is  an  unexpectedly  high  prevalence  of  sickle  trait  among  dial-
ysis  patients  who  are  African  American.  Patients  with  homozygous 
SS-sickle cell disease and less commonly SC-sickle cell disease develop 
chronic  vaso-occlusive  disease  in  many  organs.  Polymers  of  deoxy-
genated  SS-hemoglobin  distort  the  shape  of  red  blood  cells.  These 
cells attach to endothelia and obstruct small blood vessels, producing 
frequent and painful sickle cell crises over time. Early changes in the 
kidney  include  glomerular  hyperfiltration,  hyposthenuria,  micro-  or 
macroscopic  hematuria,  and  microalbuminuria.  Later  changes  can 
include papillary necrosis, renal infarction and proteinuria, and most 
commonly, FSGS on renal biopsy and rarely MPGN. Vessel occlusions 
in  the  kidney  produce  glomerular  hypertension,  FSGS,  interstitial 
nephritis, and renal infarction associated with hyposthenuria, micro-
scopic hematuria, and even gross hematuria; some patients also present 
with MPGN. Renal function can be overestimated due to the increased 
tubular secretion of creatinine seen in many patients with SS-sickle cell. 
By the second or third decade of life, persistent vaso-occlusive disease 
in the kidney leads to varying degrees of renal failure. Their prognosis 
on  dialysis  is  poor,  and  anemia  management  with  erythropoiesis-
stimulating  agents  is  complicated.  Treatment  is  directed  to  reducing 
the frequency of painful crises and administering ACE inhibitors and 
hydroxyurea  in  the  hope  of  delaying  a  progressive  decline  in  renal 
function. In sickle cell patients undergoing renal transplantation, renal 
graft survival is comparable to African Americans in the general trans-
plant population.

 ■ THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHIES
Thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (TTP),  Shiga  toxin–mediated 
hemolytic-uremic  syndrome  (HUS),  and  complement-mediated  HUS 
represent a spectrum of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). TTP 
and  HUS  share  the  general  features  of  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic 
purpura, hemolytic anemia, fever, renal failure, and neurologic distur-
bances. Clinically, when patients, particularly children, have evidence 
of renal injury, HUS is suspected, and in adults with neurologic disease, 
TTP is suspected. On examination of kidney tissue, there is evidence 
of  glomerular  capillary  endotheliosis  associated  with  platelet  thrombi, 
damage to the capillary wall, and formation of fibrin material in and 
around  glomeruli  (see  Fig.  A4-23).  These  tissue  findings  are  similar 
to  what  is  seen  in  preeclampsia/HELLP  (hemolysis,  elevated  liver 

enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome), malignant hypertension, 
and  the  antiphospholipid  syndrome.  TMA  is  also  seen  postpartum 
(and may be complement mediated); with the use of oral contracep-
tives  or  quinine;  in  renal  transplant  patients  given  OKT3  for  rejec-
tion;  in  patients  taking  the  calcineurin  inhibitors  cyclosporine  and 
tacrolimus;  in  patients  taking  the  antiplatelet  agents  ticlopidine  and 
clopidogrel; and following HIV infection. The implicated drug should 
be discontinued.

Shiga toxin–mediated HUS is caused by a toxin released by Escher-
ichia coli 0157:H7 and occasionally by Shigella dysenteriae. This Shiga 
toxin  (verotoxin)  directly  injures  endothelia,  enterocytes,  and  renal 
cells, causing apoptosis, platelet clumping, and intravascular hemolysis 
by binding to the glycolipid receptors (Gb3). These receptors are more 
abundant along endothelia in children compared to adults. Shiga toxin 
also  inhibits  the  endothelial  production  of  ADAMTS13.  In  familial 
cases  of  adult  TTP,  there  is  a  genetic  deficiency  of  the  ADAMTS13 
metalloprotease  that  cleaves  large  multimers  of  von  Willebrand’s 
factor.  Absent  ADAMTS13,  these  large  multimers  cause  platelet 
clumping  and  intravascular  hemolysis.  An  antibody  to  ADAMTS13 
is  found  in  many  sporadic  cases  of  adult  TTP.  Patients  can  be  tested 
for  ADAMTS13  activity,  and  if  low,  the  presence  of  antibodies  to 
ADAMTS13 distinguishes the deficiency from the immune-mediated 
disease.  Complement-mediated  TMA/HUS  is  a  rare  hereditary  defi-
ciency  of  one  of  the  regulatory  proteins  that  restrict  the  activation 
of  the  alternate  complement  pathway  and  can  present  in  children  or 
adults often preceded by an infection. The treatment of adult TTP with 
ADAMTS13 antibodies is daily plasmapheresis, which can be lifesav-
ing. Plasmapheresis with fresh frozen plasma is given until the platelet 
count rises, but in relapsing patients, it normally is continued well after 
the  platelet  count  improves.  There  is  an  anecdotal  role  in  relapsing 
patients  for  using  splenectomy,  steroids,  immunosuppressive  drugs, 
bortezomib,  or  rituximab.  Patients  without  antibodies  and  a  genetic 
deficiency of ADAMTS13 production can be treated with fresh frozen 
plasma alone. Patients with Shiga toxin–mediated HUS are not given 
antibiotics and are treated with supportive care because antibiotics are 
thought to accelerate the release of the toxin and the diarrhea is usu-
ally  self-limited.  Patients  with  complement-mediated  TMA/HUS  are 
treated with eculizumab, an anticomplement therapy.

GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
 ■ INFECTIOUS DISEASE–ASSOCIATED SYNDROMES
A number of infectious diseases will injure the glomerular capillaries 
as part of a systemic reaction producing an immune response or from 
direct  infection  of  renal  tissue.  Evidence  of  this  immune  response  is 
collected  by  glomeruli  in  the  form  of  immune  deposits  that  damage 
the  kidney,  producing  moderate  proteinuria  and  hematuria.  A  high 
prevalence of many of these infectious diseases in developing countries 
results  in  infection-associated  renal  disease  being  the  most  common 
cause of glomerulonephritis in many parts of the world.

Poststreptococcal  Glomerulonephritis  This  form  of  glomer-
ulonephritis is one of the classic complications of streptococcal infec-
tion. The discussion of this disease can be found earlier, in the section 
“Acute Nephritic Syndromes.”

Subacute  Bacterial  Endocarditis  Renal  injury  from  persistent 
bacteremia absent the continued presence of a foreign body, regardless 
of cause, is treated presumptively as if the patient has endocarditis. The 
discussion  of  this  disease  can  be  found  earlier,  in  the  section  “Acute 
Nephritic Syndromes.”

Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  Renal  disease  is  an  impor-
tant  complication  of  HIV  disease.  The  risk  of  development  of  ESRD 
is  much  higher  in  HIV-infected  African  Americans  than  in  HIV- 
infected whites. About 50% of HIV-infected patients with kidney dis-
ease have HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) on biopsy. The lesion

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractin HIVAN is FSGS, characteristically revealing a collapsing glomerul-
opathy (see Fig. A4-3) with visceral epithelial cell swelling, microcystic 
dilatation of renal tubules, and tubuloreticular inclusion. Renal epithe-
lial cells express replicating HIV virus, but host immune responses also 
play a role in the pathogenesis. HIVAN develops almost exclusively in 
patients  of  black  race  origin,  linked  to  APOL1  polymorphisms.  HIV 
immune  complex  kidney  disease  (HIVICK)  is  a  group  of  immune 
complex–mediated  glomerular  lesions  seen  in  HIV  patients  that,  on 
biopsy, can look like a constellation of other glomerular lesions, includ-
ing  postinfectious  glomerulonephritis,  MGN,  MPGN,  DPGN,  MCD, 
and IgA nephropathy. The HIVICK effect is a complication of active 
HIV viremia.

HIV  patients  with  FSGS  typically  present  with  nephrotic-range 
proteinuria  and  hypoalbuminemia,  but  unlike  patients  with  other 
etiologies for nephrotic syndrome, they do not commonly have hyper-
tension,  edema,  or  hyperlipidemia.  Renal  ultrasound  also  reveals 
large,  echogenic  kidneys  despite  the  finding  that  renal  function  in 
some patients declines rapidly. Treatment with inhibitors of the renin- 
angiotensin  system  decreases  the  proteinuria.  Effective  antiretroviral 
therapy benefits both the patient and the kidney and improves survival 
of  HIV-infected  patients  with  HIVAN  and,  in  some  cases,  HIVICK- 
associated chronic kidney disease or ESRD. In HIV-infected patients not 
yet on therapy, the presence of HIVAN is an indication to initiate ther-
apy.  Following  the  introduction  of  antiretroviral  therapy,  survival  on 
dialysis for the HIV-infected patient has improved dramatically. Renal 
transplantations in HIV-infected patients without detectable viral loads 
or histories of opportunistic infections provide a better survival benefit 
over dialysis. Following transplantation, patient and graft survival are 
similar to the general transplant population despite frequent rejections.

Hepatitis B and C  Typically, infected patients present with micro-
scopic  hematuria,  nonnephrotic  or  nephrotic-range  proteinuria,  and 
hypertension. There is a close association between hepatitis B infection 
and polyarteritis nodosa, with vasculitis appearing generally in the first 
6 months following infection. Renal manifestations include renal artery 
aneurysms,  renal  infarction,  and  ischemic  scars.  Alternatively,  the 
hepatitis B carrier state can produce an MGN with predominant IgG1 
deposition that is more common in children than adults or MPGN that 
is more common in adults than in children. Renal histology is indis-
tinguishable  from  idiopathic  MGN  or  MPGN.  Viral  antigens,  most 
commonly HBeAG, are found in the renal deposits. Cryoglobulinemic 
glomerulonephritis has also been reported. Treatment is with antiviral 
agents. Children have a better prognosis than adults.

Up to 30% of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection have some 
renal  manifestations.  Patients  often  present  with  type  II  mixed  cryo-
globulinemia, nephrotic syndrome, microscopic hematuria, abnormal 
liver function tests, depressed C3 levels, anti–hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
antibodies, and viral RNA in the blood. The renal lesions most com-
monly  seen,  in  order  of  decreasing  frequency,  are  cryoglobulinemic 
glomerulonephritis,  MGN,  and  MPGN,  but  polyarteritis  nodosa 
(PAN), IgA nephropathy, and FSGS have been reported. With the avail-
ability of direct-acting antivirals, which can achieve a viral remission in 
>95% of patients, the prevalence of glomerular disease in HCV patients 
should decline. These drugs are currently the treatment of choice for 
patients with HCV-related MPGN or PAN.

Other  Viruses  Other  viral  infections  are  occasionally  associated 
with  glomerular  lesions,  but  cause  and  effect  are  not  well  estab-
lished.  These  viral  infections  and  their  respective  glomerular  lesions 
include  cytomegalovirus  producing  MPGN  or  FSGS;  influenza  and 
anti-GBM disease; measles-associated endocapillary proliferative glo-
merulonephritis,  with  measles  antigen  in  the  capillary  loops  and 
mesangium; parvovirus causing mild proliferative or mesangioprolif-
erative glomerulonephritis or FSGS; mumps and mesangioproliferative 
glomerulonephritis;  Epstein-Barr  virus  producing  MPGN,  diffuse 
proliferative nephritis, or IgA nephropathy; dengue hemorrhagic fever 
causing  endocapillary  proliferative  glomerulonephritis;  Hanta  virus 
and  mesangial  proliferative  glomerulonephritis;  and  coxsackievirus 
producing focal glomerulonephritis or DPGN.

Syphilis  Secondary  syphilis,  with  rash  and  constitutional  symp-
toms,  develops  weeks  to  months  after  the  chancre  first  appears  and 
occasionally presents with the nephrotic syndrome from MGN caused 
by  subepithelial  immune  deposits  containing  treponemal  antigens. 
Other  lesions  have  also  rarely  been  described,  including  interstitial 
syphilitic  nephritis.  The  diagnosis  is  confirmed  with  nontrepone-
mal  and  treponemal  tests  for  Treponema  pallidum.  The  renal  lesion 
responds to treatment with penicillin or an alternative drug, if allergic. 
Additional testing for other sexually transmitted diseases is an impor-
tant part of disease management.

Leprosy  Despite  aggressive  eradication  programs,  new  cases  of 
leprosy appear primarily in developing countries. The diagnosis is best 
made  in  patients  with  multiple  skin  lesions  accompanied  by  sensory 
loss  in  affected  areas,  using  skin  smears  showing  paucibacillary  or 
multibacillary infection (WHO criteria). Leprosy is caused by infection 
with Mycobacterium leprae and can be classified by Ridley-Jopling criteria 
into various types: tuberculoid, borderline tuberculoid, mid-borderline 
and  borderline  lepromatous,  and  lepromatous.  Renal  involvement  in 
leprosy is related to the quantity of bacilli in the body, and the kidney 
is  one  of  the  target  organs  during  splanchnic  localization.  In  some 
series,  all  cases  with  borderline  lepromatous  and  lepromatous  types 
of  leprosy  have  various  forms  of  renal  involvement  including  FSGS, 
mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, or renal amyloidosis; much 
less common are the renal lesions of DPGN and MPGN. Treatment of 
the infection with multidrug therapy can reduce the incidence of renal 
disease or produce remission of the renal disease.

Malaria  There are 300–500 million incident cases of malaria each 
year  worldwide,  and  the  kidney  is  commonly  involved.  Glomerulo-
nephritis  is  due  to  immune  complexes  containing  malarial  antigens 
that  are  implanted  in  the  glomerulus.  In  malaria  from  P.  falciparum, 
mild proteinuria is associated with subendothelial deposits, mesangial 
deposits,  and  mesangioproliferative  glomerulonephritis  that  usually 
resolve  with  treatment.  In  quartan  malaria  from  infection  with  Plas-
modium  malariae,  children  are  more  commonly  affected  and  renal 
involvement  is  more  severe.  Transient  proteinuria  and  microscopic 
hematuria can resolve with treatment of the infection. However, resis-
tant nephrotic syndrome with progression to renal failure over 3–5 years 
does happen, as <50% of patients respond to steroid therapy. Affected 
patients  with  nephrotic  syndrome  have  thickening  of  the  glomerular 
capillary walls, with subendothelial deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 asso-
ciated with a sparse membranoproliferative lesion. The rare mesangio-
proliferative  glomerulonephritis  reported  with  Plasmodium  vivax  or 
Plasmodium ovale typically has a benign course. Acute kidney injury 
can often complicate these glomerulopathies.

Schistosomiasis  Schistosomiasis  affects  >300  million  people 
worldwide  and  primarily  involves  the  urinary  and  gastrointestinal 
tracts. Glomerular involvement varies with the specific strain of schis-
tosomiasis;  Schistosoma  mansoni  is  most  commonly  associated  with 
clinical  renal  disease,  and  the  glomerular  lesions  can  be  classified  as 
follows: class I is a mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis; class II is 
an extracapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis; class III is a membra-
noproliferative glomerulonephritis; class IV is a focal segmental glomer-
ulonephritis; and class V is amyloidosis. Classes I–II often remit with 
treatment of the infection, but class III and IV lesions are associated 
with  IgA  immune  deposits  and  progress  despite  antiparasitic  and/or 
immunosuppressive therapy.

Other Parasites  Renal involvement with toxoplasmosis infections 
is  rare.  When  it  occurs,  patients  present  with  nephrotic  syndrome 
and have a histologic picture of MPGN. Fifty percent of patients with 
leishmaniasis will have mild to moderate proteinuria and microscopic 
hematuria,  but  renal  insufficiency  is  rare.  Acute  DPGN,  MGN,  and 
mesangioproliferative  glomerulonephritis  have  all  been  observed  on 
biopsy.  Filariasis  and  trichinosis  are  caused  by  nematodes  and  are 
sometimes  associated  with  glomerular  injury  presenting  with  pro-
teinuria,  hematuria,  and  a  variety  of  histologic  lesions  that  typically 
resolve with eradication of the infection.

315 Polycystic Kidney Disease  
and Other Inherited  
Disorders of Tubule  
Growth and Development
Jing Zhou, Martin R. Pollak

The polycystic kidney diseases are a group of genetically heterogeneous 
disorders and a leading cause of kidney failure. The autosomal dom-
inant  form  of  polycystic  kidney  disease  (ADPKD)  is  the  most  com-
mon  life-threatening  monogenic  disease,  affecting  12  million  people 
worldwide. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease 
(ARPKD) is rarer but affects the pediatric population. Kidney cysts 
are  often seen in a wide range of syndromic diseases. Recent studies 
have  shown  that  defects  in  the  structure  or  function  of  the  primary 
cilia  may  underlie  this  group  of  genetic  diseases  collectively  termed 
ciliopathies (Table 315-1).
 ■ AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY 
DISEASE
Etiology and Pathogenesis (Fig. 315-1)  ADPKD is character-
ized  by  progressive  formation  of  epithelial  lined  cysts  in  the  kidney. 
Although  cysts  occur  in  only  5%  of  the  tubules  in  the  kidney,  the 
enormous growth of these cysts ultimately leads to the loss of normal 
surrounding  tissues  and  loss  of  renal  function.  The  cellular  defects 
in  ADPKD  that  have  been  known  for  a  long  time  are  increased  cell 
proliferation  and  fluid  secretion,  decreased  cell  differentiation,  and 
abnormal  extracellular  matrix.  ADPKD  is  caused  by  mutations  in 
PKD1  and  PKD2,  which,  respectively,  code  for  polycystin-1  (PC1) 
and  polycystin-2  (PC2).  PC1  is  a  large  11-transmembrane  protein 
that  functions  like  a  G-protein  coupled  receptor.  PC2  is  a  calcium- 
permeable six-transmembrane protein that structurally belongs to the 
transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel family. PC1 and PC2 
are widely expressed in almost all tissues and organs. PC1 expression is 
high in development and low in the adult, whereas PC2 expression is 
relatively constant. PC1/2 are found on the primary cilium, a hairlike 
structure present on the apical membrane of a cell, in addition to the cell 
membranes and cell–cell junctions of tubular epithelial cells. Defects in 
the  primary  cilia  are  linked  to  a  wide  spectrum  of  human  diseases, 
collectively termed ciliopathies. The most common phenotype shared 
by many ciliopathies is kidney cysts. PC1 and PC2 bind to each other 
via their respective C-terminal tails to form a receptor-channel com-
plex and regulate each other’s function. Recent evidence suggests a 1:3 

stoichiometry for PC1:PC2 in the PC1/2 channel complex. The PC1/2 
protein  complex  serves  as  a  mechanosensor  or  chemical  sensor  and 
regulates calcium and G-protein signaling. The PC1/2 protein complex 
may also directly regulate a number of cellular functions, including the 
cell  cycle,  the  actin  cytoskeleton,  planar  cell  polarity  (PCP),  and  cell 
migration. This protein complex has also been implicated in regulating 
a number of signaling pathways, including Wnt, mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR), STAT3, cMET, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/
Akt), G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), and epidermal growth fac-
tor receptor (EGFR), as well as in the localization and activity of cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). One hypoth-
esis is that  loss of ciliary function  of PC1 and  PC2 leads to aberrant 
calcium signaling and a subsequent increase of adenylyl cyclase activ-
ity and decrease of phosphodiesterase activity, which, in turn, causes 
increased cellular cAMP. Increased cAMP promotes protein kinase A 
activity,  among  other  effectors,  and,  in  turn,  leads  to  cyst  growth  by 
promoting proliferation and fluid secretion of cyst-lining cells through 
chloride and aquaporin channels in ADPKD kidneys.

ADPKD is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with complete 
penetrance,  but  variable  expressivity.  The  disease  affects  all  ethnic 
groups  worldwide  with  an  estimated  prevalence  of  1:1000  to  1:400. 
Only half of the patients with ADPKD are clinically diagnosed during 
their lifetimes. ADPKD is genetically heterogeneous. The first disease 
gene (PKD1) was localized to the region of the alpha-globin gene on 
chromosome 16p13 in 1985, and a second disease gene (PKD2) locus 
was  mapped  to  chromosome  4q21-q23  in  1993.  Mutations  of  PKD1 
and  PKD2  are  responsible  for  ~85%  and  ~15%  of  ADPKD  cases, 
respectively.  However,  patients  with  PKD2  mutations  may  be  >15% 
because they tend to have milder clinical disease and, as a result, are 
underdiagnosed.  Embryonic  lethality  of  Pkd1  and  Pkd2  knockout 
mice  suggest  human  homozygotes  may  be  lethal,  thus  not  clinically 
recognized.

PKD1  is  comprised  of  46  exons  occupying  ~52  kb  of  genomic 
DNA.  It  produces  a  ~14  kb  transcript  that  encodes  polycystin-1,  a 
protein of ~4300 amino acids. A feature of the PKD1 gene is that the 5’ 
three-quarters of PKD1 have been duplicated at six other sites on chro-
mosome  16p,  and  many  of  them  produce  mRNA  transcripts,  which 
provides a major challenge for genetic analysis of the duplicated region. 
PKD2 is a single-copy gene with 15 exons producing a ~5.3 kb mRNA 
transcript that encodes polycystin-2, a protein of 968 amino acids. Two 
additional genes, GANAB and DNAJB11, have been found in patients 
with  autosomal  dominant  form  of  polycystic  kidney  disease.  The 
GANAB  gene  encodes  the  glucosidase  IIa  subunit  and  the  DNAJB11 
gene produces a cofactor of BiP, a key chaperone in the endoplasmic 
reticulum controlling folding, trafficking, and degradation of secreted 
and membrane proteins. Both proteins appear to affect PC1 traffick-
ing.  However,  these  mutations  have  only  been  found  in  a  very  small 
number of families.

In  ADPKD  patients,  every  cell  carries  a  germline  mutant  allele  of 
either PKD1 or PKD2. However, cysts develop in only a small fraction 
of the nephrons. Cysts are thought to originate from clonal growth of 
single cells that have received a somatic “second hit” mutation in the 
“normal” allele of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene. Accumulating evidence in 
mouse models now shows that partial loss of function of the second 
allele  of  Pkd1  in  a  proliferative  environment  is  sufficient  for  cysto-
genesis, suggesting that a critical amount of PKD1 is needed in a cell. 
Somatic inactivation of the second allele of Pkd1 in adult mice results 
in very slow onset of cyst development in the kidney, but a “third hit” 
such as an additional genetic or epigenetic event, the inactivation of a 
growth suppressor gene, the activation of a growth promoting gene(s), 
or an event such as renal injury that activates the developmental pro-
gram, may promote rapid cyst formation.

Clinical Manifestations  ADPKD is characterized by the progres-
sive  bilateral  formation  of  renal  cysts.  Focal  renal  cysts  are  typically 
detected  in  affected  subjects  aged  <30  years.  Hundreds  to  thousands 
of  cysts  are  usually  present  in  the  kidneys  of  most  patients  in  the 
fifth  decade  (Fig.  315-2).  Enlarged  kidneys  can  each  reach  a  four-
fold increase in length and weigh up to 20 times the normal weight.

The clinical presentations of ADPKD are highly variable. While many 
patients are asymptomatic until the fourth to fifth decade of life and 
are diagnosed by incidental discoveries of hypertension or abdominal 
masses, back or flank pain is a frequent symptom in ~60% of patients 
with ADPKD. The pain may result from renal cyst infection, hemor-
rhage, or nephrolithiasis. Gross hematuria resulting from cyst rupture 
occurs  in  ~40%  of  patients  during  the  course  of  their  disease,  and 
many of them will have recurrent episodes. Flank pain and hematuria 
may coexist if the cyst that ruptures is connected with the collecting 
system.  Proteinuria  is  usually  a  minor  feature  of  ADPKD.  Infection 
is the second most common cause of death for patients with ADPKD. 
Up  to  half  of  patients  with  ADPKD  will  have  one  or  more  episodes 
of  renal  infection  during  their  lifetimes.  An  infected  cyst  and  acute 
pyelonephritis  are  the  most  common  renal  infections  often  due  to 
gram-negative bacteria, which are associated with fever and flank pain, 
with  or  without  bacteremia.  These  complications  and  renal  insuffi-
ciency  often  correlate  with  structural  abnormality  of  the  renal  par-
enchyma. Mutations in GANAB and DNAJB11 genes result in milder 
cystic kidney disease than that in classic ADPKD with small renal cysts 
and normal-sized kidneys. Sometimes patients with GANAB mutations 
present with ADPLD-like phenotype. Patients with DNAJB11 develop 
renal  fibrosis,  characteristic  of  autosomal  dominant  tubulointerstitial 
disease  (ADTKD)  discussed  below.  Kidney  stones  occur  in  ~20%  of 
patients  with  ADPKD.  Different  from  the  general  population,  more 
than half of the stones in patients with ADPKD are composed of uric 
acid,  with  the  remainder  due  to  calcium  oxalate.  Distal  acidification 

defects, abnormal ammonium transport, low urine pH, and hypocitra-
turia may be important in the pathogenesis of renal stones in ADPKD. 
Renal cell carcinoma is a rare complication of ADPKD with no appar-
ent increased frequency compared to the general population. However, 
in  ADPKD  these  tumors  are  more  often  bilateral  at  presentation, 
multicentric, and sarcomatoid in type. Radiologic imaging is often not 
helpful in distinguishing cyst infection and cyst hemorrhage because of 
their complexity. CT scan and MRI are often useful in distinguishing 
a malignancy from a complex cyst. Cardiovascular complications are 
the major cause of mortality in patients with ADPKD. Hypertension is 
common, and typically occurs before any reduction in glomerular fil-
tration rate (GFR). Hypertension is a risk factor for both cardiovascular 
and kidney disease progression in ADPKD. Notably, some normoten-
sive patients with ADPKD may also have left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Hypertension  in  ADPKD  may  result  from  the  increased  activation 
of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system,  increased  sympathetic 
nerve  activity,  and  impaired  endothelial  cilium  function-dependent 
relaxation of small resistant blood vessels.

The  progression  of  ADPKD  has  striking  inter-  and  intrafamilial 
variability. The disease can present as early as in utero, but end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) typically occurs in late middle age. Risk factors 
include  early  diagnosis  of  ADPKD,  hypertension,  gross  hematuria, 
multiple pregnancies, and large kidney size. Liver cysts derived from 
the  biliary  epithelia  are  the  most  common  extrarenal  complication. 
Polycystic liver disease associated with ADPKD is different from auto-
somal  dominant  polycystic  liver  disease  (ADPLD),  which  is  caused

by mutations in at least two distinct genes (PRKCSH and SEC63) and 
does  not  progress  to  renal  failure.  Massive  polycystic  liver  disease 
occurs almost exclusively in women with ADPKD, particularly those 
with  multiple  pregnancies.  Heterozygous  loss-of-function  variants 
in  PKHD1,  ALG8,  GANAB,  and  SEC61B  are  now  found  in  ADPLD. 
ALG8, GANAB, and SEC61B all encode ER proteins that are involved 
in  the  same  pathway  as  GIIβ  and  SEC63,  and  each  appears  to  affect 
PC1 biogenesis.

Intracranial  aneurysm  (ICA)  occurs  four  to  five  times  more  fre-
quently  in  APDKD  patients  than  in  the  general  population  and 
causes  high  mortality.  The  disease  gene  products  PC1  and  PC2  may 
be directly responsible for defects in arterial smooth muscle cells and 
myofibroblasts.  The  focal  nature  and  the  natural  history  of  ICA  in 
ADPKD  remain  unclear.  A  family  history  of  ICA  is  a  risk  factor  of 
aneurysm  rupture  in  ADPKD;  whether  hypertension  and  cigarette 
smoking  are  independent  risk  factors  is  not  clear.  About  20–50%  of 
patients  may  experience  “warning  headaches”  preceding  the  index 
episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured ICA. A CT scan 
is generally used as the first diagnostic test. A lumbar puncture may 
be used to confirm the diagnosis. The role of radiologic screening for 
ICA in asymptomatic patients with ADPKD remains unclear. ADPKD 
patients with a positive family history of ICAs may undergo presymp-
tomatic screening of ICAs by MR angiography. Other vascular abnor-
malities in ADPKD patients include diffuse arterial dolichoectasias of 
the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation, which can predispose to 
arterial dissection and stroke. Mitral valve prolapse occurs in up to 30% 
of patients with ADPKD, and tricuspid valve prolapse is less common. 
Other  valvular  abnormalities  occurring  with  increased  frequency  in 
ADPKD patients include insufficiency of the mitral, aortic, and tricus-
pid valves. Most patients are asymptomatic but some may progress and 
require valve replacement. The prevalence of colonic diverticulae and 
abdominal wall hernias is also increased in ADPKD patients.

Diagnosis  A  diagnosis  is  typically  made  from  a  positive  family 
history  consistent  with  autosomal  dominant  inheritance  and  mul-
tiple  kidney  cysts  bilaterally.  Renal  ultrasonography  is  often  used  
for  presymptomatic  screening  of  at-risk  subjects  and  for  evaluation 
of potential living-related kidney donors from ADPKD families. The 
presence of at least two renal cysts (unilateral or bilateral) is sufficient 
for  diagnosis  among  at-risk  subjects  between  15  and  29  years  of  age 
with a sensitivity value of 96% and specificity value of 100%. The pres-
ence of at least two cysts in each kidney and at least four cysts in each 
kidney, respectively, is required for the diagnosis among at-risk subjects 
aged 30–59 years and aged ≥60 years with a sensitivity value of 100% 
and  specificity  value  of  100%.  This  is  because  there  is  an  increased 
frequency  of  developing  simple  renal  cysts  with  age.  Conversely,  in 
subjects aged between 30 and 59 years the absence of at least two cysts 
in each kidney, which is associated with a false negative rate of 0%, can 
be used for disease exclusion. These criteria have a lower sensitivity for 
patients with a PKD2 mutation because of a late onset of ADPKD2. CT 
scan and T2-MRI, with and without contrast enhancement, are more 
sensitive  than  ultrasonography  and  can  detect  cysts  of  smaller  size. 
However,  a  CT  scan  exposes  the  patient  to  radiation  and  radiocon-
trast,  which  may  cause  serious  allergic  reactions  and  nephrotoxicity 
in  patients  with  renal  insufficiency.  T2-MRI,  with  gadolinium  as  a 
contrast agent, has minimal renal toxicity and can detect cysts of only 
2–3  mm  in  diameter.  However,  a  large  majority  of  cysts  may  still  be 
below the detection level. Genetic testing by linkage analyses and muta-
tional  analyses  is  available  for  ambiguous  cases.  Because  of  the  large 
size  of  PKD1  gene  and  the  presence  of  multiple  highly  homologous 
pseudogenes, mutational analysis of PKD1 gene is difficult and costly. 
Application  of  new  technologies  such  as  paired-end  next-generation 
sequencing with multiplexing individually bar-coded long-range PCR 
libraries may reduce the costs and improve the sensitivity for clinical 
genetic testing.

transplantation.  Peritoneal  dialysis  may  not  be  suitable  for  some 
patients  with  massively  enlarged  polycystic  kidneys  due  to  the 
small  intraabdominal  space  for  efficient  peritoneal  exchange  of 
fluid  and  solutes  and  increased  chance  of  abdominal  hernia  and 
back pain. Patients with very large polycystic kidneys and recur-
rent  renal  cyst  infection  may  require  pretransplant  nephrectomy 
or bilateral nephrectomy to accommodate the allograft and reduce 
the pain.

Specific treatment strategies for ADPKD have focused on slow-
ing renal disease progression and lowering cardiovascular risk. For 
the latter, the main approach is to control blood pressure by inhibit-
ing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The HALT PKD trial 
was set to evaluate the impact of intensive blockade of the renin- 
angiotensin-aldosterone system and levels of blood pressure control 
on  progressive  renal  disease.  This  trial  found  that  rigorous  blood 
pressure  control  could  slow  cyst  growth.  Most  approaches  target 
the slowing of renal disease progression by inhibiting cell prolifera-
tion and fluid secretion. Several clinical trials have been conducted 
targeting cell proliferation: sirolimus and everolimus, inhibitors of 
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway; OPC31260 
and  tolvaptan,  which  inhibits  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate 
(cAMP) pathways by antagonizing the activation of vasopressin V2 
receptor  (V2R)  in  collecting  ducts  and  reduces  cell  proliferation 
by  decreasing  renal  cAMP  levels;  and  somatostatin  analogues, 
which  reduce  cAMP  levels  by  binding  to  several  G-protein  cou-
pled receptors. The TAMPO and ALADIN trials showed that V2R 
antagonists  and  somatostatin  analogues  (octreotide-LAR  groups) 
respectively slowed the decline of renal function. Some side effects, 
such  as  liver  function  impairment,  polydipsia,  and  diarrhea,  have 
been observed for tolvaptan and cholecystitis for octreotide-LAR. A 
recent report also showed that tolvaptan reduces renal pain. DIPAK, 
a small multicenter European study, showed that nerve block may 
be used to relieve pain in ADPKD patients suffering with refractory 
chronic  pain.  A  combination  of  different  growth  inhibitors  may 
enhance efficacy and reduce side effects. Notably, treatments may 
vary depending on the patient population. For example, the FDA 
has indicated tolvaptan to be only for patients at risk of rapidly pro-
gressing  disease.  Combining  genotypic  and  imaging  information 
may predict kidney growth rates and help in selecting this patient 
population.

Additional preclinical studies in animal models include the use 
of  inhibitors  to  nonreceptor  tyrosine  kinase  Src,  B-raf,  cycline- 
dependent kinase (CDK), transcription factors STAT3 and STAT6 
(pyrimethamine and leflunomide), purinergic receptors, hepato-
cyte growth factor receptor, glucosylceramide, agonists to perox-
isome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) receptors 
(thiazolidodinediones),  and  targeting  microRNAs.  Reprogram-
ming  the  metabolic  pathway  through  studies  of  transcription 
regulator  super  enhancer  as  well  as  dietary  control  including 
time-restricted  feeding,  have  been  shown  in  murine  models 
to  reduce  cyst  area,  kidney  fibrosis,  inflammation,  and  injury. 
Branched chain amino acids appear to enhance cyst development 
in a mouse model.

 ■ AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE POLYCYSTIC  
KIDNEY DISEASE

Genetic Considerations  ARPKD is a significant hereditary 
renal disease in childhood, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 
20,000  live  births.  A  carrier  frequency  of  up  to  1:70  has  been 
reported. Mutations in a single gene, PKHD1, are responsible for all 
the  clinical  presentations  of  ARPKD.  PKHD1,  localized  on  human 
chromosome region 6p21.1–6p12.2, is one of the largest genes in the 
genome, occupies ~450 kb of DNA, and contains at least 86 exons. It 
produces  multiple  alternatively  spliced  transcripts.  The  largest  tran-
script encodes fibrocystin/polyductin (FPC), which is a large receptor-
like  integral  membrane  protein  of  4074  amino  acids.  FPC  has  a

dominant polycystic kidney disease. The kidney has been cut open to expose the 
parenchyma and internal aspects of cysts.

TREATMENT
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease

No specific treatment to prevent cyst growth or the decline of renal 
function  has  been  approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Admin-
istration.  Blood  pressure  control  to  a  target  of  140/90  mmHg  is 
recommended according to the guidelines from the eighth report 
of  the  Joint  National  Committee  on  Prevention,  Detection,  Eval-
uation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VIII report) 
for  reducing  cardiovascular  complications  in  ADPKD  and  renal 
disease progression. More rigorous blood pressure control does not 
equal greater clinical benefits. Maintaining a target systolic blood 
pressure to 110 mmHg in patients with moderate or advanced dis-
ease may increase the risk of renal disease progression by reducing 
renal  blood  flow.  Lipid-soluble  antibiotics  against  common  gram- 
negative  enteric  organisms  include  trimethoprim-sulfamethox-
azole, quinolones, and chloramphenicol, and are preferred for cyst 
infection  because  most  renal  cysts  are  not  connected  to  glomer-
ular  filtration  and  antibiotics  that  are  capable  of  penetrating  the 
cyst walls are likely to be more effective. Treatment often requires 
4–6  weeks.  The  treatment  of  kidney  stones  in  ADPKD  includes 
standard  measures  such  as  analgesics  for  pain  relief,  and  hydra-
tion to ensure adequate urine flow. Management of chronic flank, 
back,  or  abdominal  pain  due  to  renal  enlargement  may  include 
both  pharmacologic  (nonnarcotic  and  narcotic  analgesics)  and 
nonpharmacologic  (transcutaneous  electrical  nerve  stimulation, 
acupuncture, and biofeedback). Occasionally surgical decompres-
sion of cysts may be necessary. More than half of ADPKD patients 
eventually  require  peritoneal  dialysis,  hemodialysis,  or  kidney

2354 single transmembrane, a large N-terminal extracellular region, and a 
short intracellular cytoplasmic domain. FPC is localized on the pri-
mary cilia of epithelia cells of cortical and medullary collecting ducts 
and  cholangiocytes  of  bile  ducts,  similar  to  polycystins  and  several 
other ciliopathy proteins. FPC is also expressed on the basal body and 
plasma  membrane.  The  large  extracellular  domain  of  FPC  is  pre-
sumed to bind to an as yet unknown ligand(s) and is involved in cell-
cell and cell-matrix interactions. FPC interacts with ADPKD protein 
PC2,  and  may  also  participate  in  regulation  of  the  mechanosensory 
function of the primary cilia, calcium signaling, and PCP, suggesting 
a common mechanism underlying cystogenesis between ADPKD and 
ARPKD. FPC is also found on the centrosomes and mitotic spindle, 
and may regulate centrosome duplication and mitotic spindle assem-
bly  during  cell  division.  A  large  number  of  various  mutations  have 
been found throughout PKHD1, and are unique to individual families. 
Most  patients  are  compound  heterozygotes  for  PKHD1  mutations. 
Patients with two truncation mutations appear to have an earlier onset 
of the disease.

Clinical Features  Classic ARPKD is generally diagnosed in utero 
or  within  the  neonatal  period,  and  characterized  by  greatly  enlarged 
echogenic kidneys in diseased fetuses. Reduced fetal urine production 
may contribute to oligohydroaminos and pulmonary hypoplasia. About 
30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insuf-
ficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life. 
In  the  classic  group,  most  patients  are  born  with  renal  insufficiency 
and  ESRD.  However,  infants  often  have  a  transient  improvement  in 
their  GFR;  death  from  renal  insufficiency  at  this  stage  is  rare.  Some 
patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage, which form the older 
group.  Morbidity  and  mortality  in  this  group  often  involve  systemic 
hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations. 
The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a 
primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, 
namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic 
bile  ducts  (Caroli  disease).  CHF  and  Caroli  disease  can  then  lead  to 
portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, 
and cholangitis. Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year 
of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 
20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD, and markedly 
atrophic  kidneys  following  renal  transplantation.  The  slow  progres-
sion of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the 
development of cysts. Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD 
patients, even those with normal renal function.

Diagnosis  Ultrasonography, CT, and MRI all can be used for diag-
nosis.  Ultrasonography  reveals  large,  echogenic  kidneys  with  poor 
corticomedullary differentiation. The diagnosis can be made in utero 
after  24  weeks  of  gestation  in  severe  cases.  Macrocysts  generally  are 
not common at birth in ARPKD patients. The absence of renal cysts in 
either parent, particularly if they are >40 years of age, on ultrasonogra-
phy helps distinguish ARPKD from ADPKD in older patients. Clinical, 
laboratory, or radiographic evidence of hepatic fibrosis, hepatic pathol-
ogy  demonstrating  characteristic  ductal  plate  abnormalities,  family 
history  of  affected  siblings,  or  parental  consanguinity  suggestive  of 
autosomal recessive inheritance is helpful. The lack of mutational hot 
spots and the large and complex genomic structure of  PKHD1 make 
molecular diagnosis difficult; however, presymptomatic screen of other 
at-risk members in a family with already identified ARPKD mutations 
is straightforward and inexpensive.

TREATMENT
Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease

There  is  no  specific  therapy  for  ARPKD.  Appropriate  neona-
tal  intensive  care,  blood  pressure  control,  dialysis,  and  kidney 
transplantation increase survival into adulthood. Complications of 
hepatic fibrosis may necessitate liver transplantation. Patients with 
severe Caroli disease may need portosystemic shunting. Upcoming 

therapies  may  target  abnormal  cell  signaling  mechanisms,  as 
described above for ADPKD.

OTHER DISEASES CHARACTERIZED BY 
LARGE KIDNEY CYSTS
 ■ TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS
Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome caused 
by mutations in one of two genes, TSC1, encoding hamartin, or, TSC2, 
encoding tuberin. Published estimates of prevalence vary widely, but it 
certainly occurs in <1:5000 births. Kidney cysts are a frequent feature 
of  this  condition,  as  are  two  other  abnormalities  of  kidney  growth, 
renal  cell  carcinoma  and  renal  angiomyolipomas.  TS  is  a  syndrome 
affecting multiple organ systems. Other features of TS include benign 
growths  in  the  nervous  system,  eyes,  heart,  lung,  liver,  and  the  skin. 
Essentially all TS patients have such skin lesions, and a large proportion 
of  patients  have  neurologic  and  cognitive  manifestations.  The  TSC2 
gene is adjacent to PKD1 in the human genome. Some patients have 
deletions in their genomic DNA that inactivate these two genes. Such 
individuals  may  have  manifestations  of  both  ADPKD  and  TS.  The 
majority of TS-causing mutations are found in TSC2.

Renal cysts are observed in about 20–30% of people with TS. The 
most  common  kidney  finding  in  TS  is  the  presence  of  angiomyoli-
pomas.  These  growths  tend  to  be  multiple  and  bilateral.  While  they 
are usually benign, they may bleed. Surgical removal is often recom-
mended  as  a  prophylactic  measure  in  people  with  angiomyolipomas 
>4 cm in diameter. The cysts in TS are radiographically similar to those 
seen  in  ADPKD.  In  contrast  to  ADPKD,  there  is  a  clearly  increased 
risk of renal cell carcinoma in TS patients. Regular periodic imaging is 
recommended in TS patients with kidney involvement to screen for the 
development of renal cell carcinoma. These cysts may rarely become 
large  and  hemorrhagic,  occasionally  requiring  nephrectomy  when 
nephron-sparing surgery is not possible.

Although a rare problem, TS may lead to significant chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and progress to end-stage kidney failure. Patients with 
TS and CKD typically have an unremarkable urine sediment and only 
minimal to mild amounts of proteinuria.

Mechanistically,  the  TSC1  and  TSC2  gene  products  tuberin  and 
hamartin interact physically. This protein complex is localized to the 
base of the cilia and inhibits intracellular signaling processes mediated 
by  mTOR  (mammalian  target  of  rapamycin),  leading  to  abnormal 
growth  in  a  number  of  tissues.  Everolimus,  an  mTOR  inhibitor,  has 
been  approved  in  the  United  States  for  treatment  of  TSC-associated 
kidney  tumors  as  well  as  nonkidney  manifestations  of  TS.  Regular 
surveillance is perhaps the most important component of the clinical 
management of the kidney manifestations of TS.
 ■ VON HIPPEL-LINDAU DISEASE
Von  Hippel-Lindau  disease  (VHL)  is  an  inherited  cancer  syndrome 
with  renal  manifestations.  VHL  is  an  autosomal  dominant  condition 
caused  by  mutations  in  the  VHL  tumor-suppressor  gene.  The  VHL 
protein plays a critical role in the regulation of hypoxia pathways and 
oxygen  sensing  via  the  transcription  factor  hypoxia-inducible  factor 
(HIF). Like many other autosomal dominant cancer syndromes, VHL 
is recessive at the cellular level: a somatic mutation in the second VHL 
allele  leads  to  loss  of  VHL  in  the  cell  and  abnormal  growth.  Kidney 
manifestations  of  VHL  include  multiple  bilateral  kidney  cysts  and 
renal cell carcinomas. Kidney cysts and carcinoma affect the majority 
of VHL patients. Nonrenal features of VHL include pheochromocyto-
mas, cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and retinal hemangiomas. While 
much rarer than ADPKD, VHL is an entity that should be considered 
in  the  differential  diagnosis  of  an  individual  with  newly  recognized 
kidney cysts.

In these patients, annual screening of the kidneys by imaging with 
CT or MRI scanning is recommended for early detection of renal cell 
carcinomas.  Increasingly,  nephron-sparing  surgical  approaches  are 
being used for removal of cancerous lesions in order to preserve kidney 
function.

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary TractOTHER INHERITED DISEASES OF TUBULE 
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
ADPKD  is  by  far  the  most  common  adult-onset  single-gene  form  of 
adult-onset kidney disease. The large cysts that are sometimes seen in 
VHL and TS are similar in appearance to the cysts seen in ADPKD. A 
variety of other inherited disorders affecting primarily tubule and renal 
interstitial  function  can  lead  to  CKD  and  eventual  end-stage  kidney 
disease in the absence of large tubule-derived cysts.

Inherited  diseases  affecting  the  tubulointerstitial  compartment  of 
the kidney can lead to secondary glomerular stress and glomeruloscle-
rosis with some degree of concomitant proteinuria. Similarly, disorders 
of  glomerular  function  will  typically  lead  to  secondary  interstitial 
fibrosis and tubule atrophy. From a clinical perspective, therefore, dis-
tinguishing between a genetic disease of the renal tubules and a disease 
of the glomerulus may not be easy, particularly in the absence of a gross 
phenotype such as large kidney cysts.

 ■ AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT TUBULOINTERSTITIAL 
KIDNEY DISEASE (MEDULLARY CYSTIC KIDNEY 
DISEASE)
The  term  autosomal  dominant  tubulointerstitial  kidney  disease 
(ADTKD)  has  replaced  the  phrase  medullary  cystic  kidney  disease 
(MCKD) as the preferred designation for a group of autosomal domi-
nant disorders characterized by progressive kidney failure and a benign 
urine sediment. Despite the old nosology, kidney cysts are not invari-
ably present. Older literature often grouped MCKD together with the 
childhood-onset disorders known as the nephronophthises, but these 
are distinct clinical and genetic entities.

ADTKD-MUC1  Patients  with  medullary  cystic  kidney  disease 
type I (MCKD I) have mutations in the mucin 1 gene MUC1. In con-
trast to MCKD II patients, individuals with MCKD I do not have ele-
vated uric acid levels. The disease-causing MUC1 mutations that have 
been reported all alter a highly repetitive region within the MUC1 gene. 
This leads to the production of a large “neoprotein” fragment that has 
toxic effects on the kidney tubule.

Clinically, patients with MCKD I exhibit slowly progressive CKD in 
adulthood, with only minimal amounts of increased urine protein and 
occasional renal cysts seen on ultrasound examination. Kidney histol-
ogy shows tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Disease does 
not recur in transplanted kidneys.

ADTKD-UMOD  ADTKD-UMOD  (also  called  MCKD  II)  is 
caused  by  mutations  in  the  UMOD  gene,  which  encodes  the  protein 
uromodulin,  also  known  as  Tamm-Horsfall  protein.  Uromodulin  is 
also  found  on  the  centrosome,  the  mitotic  spindle,  and  the  primary 
cilia; it colocalizes with nephrocystin-1 and KIF3A on the cilia. UMOD 
mutations also cause the conditions that have been referred to as famil-
ial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (HNFJ1) and glomerulocystic 
kidney  disease  (GCKD),  although  it  is  not  clear  that  these  different 
names  represent  clearly  distinct  disorders.  The  term  uromodulin- 
associated  kidney  disease  (or  UAKD)  has  been  suggested  as  a  better 
name  for  MCKD  II  and  the  various  other  related  UMOD-associated 
diseases. Despite the name, kidney cysts are not a common feature of 
MCKD II. MCKD II should be suspected clinically in patients with a 
family  history  of  late-onset  kidney  disease,  benign  urine  sediments, 
absence of significant proteinuria, and hyperuricemia. Large genome-
wide  association  studies  have  suggested  that  certain  common  non-
coding sequence variants in UMOD are associated with a moderately 
increased  risk  of  CKD  in  the  general  population.  UMOD-associated 
disease is often associated with gout.

Other Forms of Familial Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease  A 
small  number  of  families  have  been  identified  with  autosomal  dom-
inant  tubulointerstitial  kidney  disease  and  hyperuricemia  who  lack 
UMOD  mutations.  Some  of  these  families  carry  disease-segregating 
mutations in the renin gene REN (disease designation ADTKD-REN). 
ADKTKD-REN patients demonstrate hyporeninemia with mild hyper-
kalemia, and often have hyperuricemia and gout. Mutations in HNF1β 
and SEC61A1 are even rarer causes of ADTKD.

2355

Kidney biopsies in patients with any of the various forms of ADTKD 
typically  show  interstitial  fibrosis.  These  histologic  features  are  not 
diagnostic  of  any  particular  genetic  entity,  and  the  specific  diagnosis 
must be made by other means. Genetic tests for alterations in specific 
genes and in large panels of kidney disease genes are available in the 
clinical  setting.  High  cost  and  complexity  in  interpretation  are  the 
major barriers to the use of such testing.

Those patients with autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease, 
UMOD  or  REN  mutations,  with  hyperuricemia  and  gout  should  be 
treated similarly to others with these findings, with uric-acid lowering 
agents, such as allopurinol or febuxostat.

NEPHRONOPHTHISIS
A  large  and  growing  number  of  genetically  distinct  but  related  sets 
of  autosomal  recessive  disorders  are  referred  to  as  nephronophthises, 
or  nephronophthisis-related  ciliopathies.  These  entities  should  not  be 
confused  with  the  adult-onset  autosomal  dominant  MCKD  discussed 
above, despite the often confusing nomenclature seen in older medical 
literature.  Each  of  the  individual  forms  of  nephronophthisis  is  quite 
rare, but together this category constitutes the most common inherited 
childhood form of kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy.
Like  ADPKD  and  ARPKD,  the  various  genetically  heterogeneous 
entities that fall under the category of nephronophthisis (NPHP) are 
disorders of ciliary function. Mutations in >90 genes have been identi-
fied that lead to NPHP under an autosomal recessive pattern of inher-
itance. Some of these gene defects cause limited kidney disease, while 
many cause ciliopathies characterized by multiple organ involvement. 
The  various  forms  of  NPHP  share  common  features,  including  tub-
ulointerstitial  fibrosis,  corticomedullary  cysts,  and  progressive  CKD, 
leading  to  renal  failure.  Proteinuria  is  absent  or  mild,  and  the  urine 
sediment is not active.

NPHP is often divided into infantile, juvenile, and adolescent forms. 
The juvenile form is the most frequent, and usually caused by mutations 
in the NPHP2 gene. The infantile form, usually caused by NPHP2 muta-
tions,  is  associated  with  end-stage  kidney  failure  in  early  childhood. 
Patients with the adolescent form of NPHP typically develop end-stage 
kidney failure in early adulthood. Hypertension, if present, tends to be 
a late finding in the course of the NPHPs. The products of the NPHP 
genes are referred to as nephrocystins. NPHP1 through NPHP20 have 
been reported; some are referred to by other names, as well.

NPHP can present as an isolated finding, or be part of several multi-
organ syndromes. Neurologic abnormalities are present in a significant 
number  of  patients.  Bone  and  liver  abnormalities  are  seen  in  some 
NPHP patients. Senior-Loken syndrome is defined by the presence of 
NPHP with retinitis pigmentosa. Joubert syndrome is defined by mul-
tiple neurologic findings, including hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis. 
Some forms of this genetically heterogeneous syndrome include NPHP 
as a component.

The  multisystem  disease  Bardet-Biedl  syndrome  (BBS)  is  defined 
clinically by a spectrum of features, including truncal obesity, cognitive 
impairment,  retinal  dystrophy,  polydactyly,  developmental  urogenital 
abnormalities, and kidney cysts. The kidney phenotype is NPHP-like, 
with small cysts deriving from the tubules, tubulointerstitial and often 
secondary  glomerular  disease,  and  urine  concentrating  defects.  To 
date, 21 BBS genes have been identified. BBS follows autosomal reces-
sive inheritance. Like ADPKD, ARPKD, and NPHP, BBS is a disease of 
abnormal ciliary function.

The  multiple  genes  and  gene  products  (nephrocystins)  that  are 
responsible for NPHP are expressed in cilia, basal bodies, and the cen-
trosomes of kidney tubules cells. It has been hypothesized that all of 
the NPHP gene defects lead to a clinical phenotype by interfering with 
the regulation of PCP.

There are no specific clinical tests that define NPHP. Genetic diag-
nosis is possible, complicated because of the large number of genes that 
can be responsible, but now quite feasible due to new DNA sequencing 
technologies. There are no specific therapies for NPHP. Rather, therapy 
is  aimed  at  treating  signs  of  these  diseases  as  well  as  those  systemic 
abnormalities  seen  with  all  CKDs.  Chronic  dialysis  or  kidney  trans-
plantation are eventually required for NPHP-affected individuals.

2356 KARYOMEGALIC TUBULOINTERSTITIAL 

NEPHRITIS
Karyomegalic tubulointerstitial nephritis is an exceptionally rare form 
of kidney disease with adult-onset progressive kidney failure. Kidney 
biopsy  shows  chronic  tubulointerstitial  nephritis,  as  well  as  intersti-
tial fibrosis. This is a recessive disorder caused by inheritance of two 
mutant  copies  of  the  FAN1  gene.  FAN1  encodes  a  component  of  a 
DNA  repair  machinery  complex.  Individuals  with  two  mutant  FAN1 
genes are genetically sensitized to the effect of DNA damage. Kidney 
histology shows karyomegaly in addition to the nonspecific findings of 
interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.

MEDULLARY SPONGE KIDNEY
Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is often grouped together with inher-
ited disorders of the kidney affecting tubule growth and development, 
although  it  is  usually  a  sporadic  finding  rather  than  an  inherited 
phenotype. MSK is caused by developmental malformation and cystic 
dilatation of the renal collecting ducts. The medullary cysts seen in this 
entity can be quite variable in size.

MSK is usually a benign entity. The diagnosis of MSK is often made 
incidentally. In the past, the diagnosis of MSK was often made by intra-
venous pyelography (IVP). CT urography, which has replaced IVPs for 
much routine kidney imaging, is not as sensitive in detecting MSK.

MSK  is  associated  with  an  increased  frequency  of  calcium  phos-
phate and calcium oxalate kidney stones. Altered flow characteristics 
in the kidney tubules may lead to the development of formation of a 
nidus for stone formation. Kidney stones in this group are treated the 
same as are kidney stones in the general population. MSK patients also 
often  exhibit  reduced  kidney  concentrating  ability  and  an  increased 
frequency of urinary tract infections.

CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES OF THE 
KIDNEY AND URINARY TRACT
The  structural  abnormalities  known  as  CAKUT  (Congenital  Abnor-
malities of the Kidney and Urinary Tract) are a group of etiologically 
and phenotypically heterogeneous disorders. Some form of CAKUT is 
estimated to occur in up to 1 in 500 live births. Specific abnormalities 
classified as part of the CAKUT spectrum include kidney hypoplasia, 
kidney agenesis, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and vesicoureteral 
reflux.

CAKUT can be the cause of clinically significant problems in both 
adults and children. However, it is a major contributor to kidney failure 
in  children,  accounting  for  more  than  one-third  of  end-stage  kidney 
disease in this group.

CAKUT is typically a sporadic finding but can also cluster in fam-
ilies. Familial forms can be observed as parts of multisystem develop-
mental syndromes. A growing list of specific genes have been identified 
that when mutated lead to both nonsyndromic and syndromic forms 
of  CAKUT.  For  example,  the  branchio-oto-renal  syndrome,  charac-
terized by developmental abnormalities in the neck, ears, and kidney, 
can be caused by mutations in the EYA1 and SIX1 genes. Mutations in 
the PAX2 transcription factor gene can cause the autosomal dominant 
renal  coloboma  syndrome,  characterized  by  optic  nerve  malforma-
tions  and  hypoplastic  kidneys.  A  nontrivial  fraction  of  children  with 
CKD have an unsuspected genomic imbalance, often disrupting genes 
known  to  be  relevant  to  CAKUT  and  kidney  development.  It  is  not 
uncommon for such genetic lesions to affect both kidney and neuro-
cognitive function.

In many instances, CAKUT is caused by environmental influences 
rather than genetic alterations. For example, renal tubular dysgenesis, 
defined  by  altered  tubule  development,  can  be  caused  by  prenatal 
exposure of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 
receptor blockers.

MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE
Inherited  disorders  of  the  mitochondrial  genome  (discussed  else-
where  in  this  text  [see  also  Chap.  468])  commonly  affect  kidney 
function.  Thirteen  of  the  genes  involved  in  encoding  components  of 

the mitochondrial respiratory chain are located on the mitochondrial 
genome that is inherited maternally. The remainder of these compo-
nents are encoded by the nuclear genome. These defects of oxidative 
phosphorylation may affect multiple organs and tissues.

Neuromuscular disease is the best recognized part of this complex 
phenotype.  Kidney  disease  is  now  recognized  as  a  common  compo-
nent, as well. Tubulointerstitial disease may be seen on kidney biopsy, 
and progression to kidney failure may occur. Glomerular involvement, 
manifest  as  proteinuria  and  glomerulosclerosis,  can  also  develop. 
Changes in proximal tubule activity are the most common renal phe-
notype. Patients may have several defects in proximal tubule transport, 
including the Fanconi syndrome. Some patients may also have acidosis, 
hypophosphatemic rickets, hypercalciuria, glycosuria, and tubular pro-
teinuria. Decreased urine concentrating ability is common.

DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERTIONS
Recent studies using new DNA sequencing technologies suggest that 
variants in Mendelian kidney disease genes contribute to a nontrivial 
fraction of CKD cases, even when a clear Mendelian disease phenotype 
or  family  history  of  disease  is  lacking.  Many  studies  also  lead  to  the 
conclusion that various rare genetically mediated kidney diseases are 
difficult to categorize by phenotype alone. These diseases may mimic 
each  other,  an  argument  for  using  fairly  large  panels  (or  the  entire 
genome) in genetic testing in the setting of kidney disease. The old and 
complicated  nomenclature  used  to  describe  human  kidney  diseases 
is  expected  to  continue  to  be  replaced  by  newer,  genetically  defined, 
categories.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
The  disorders  discussed  above  are  all  seen  worldwide.  In  addition,  a 
previously unrecognized epidemic of kidney disease is leading to very 
high  rates  of  kidney  failure  in  and  near  the  western  coast  of  Central 
America.  This  mesoamerican  nephropathy  is  particularly  common 
in  Nicaragua  and  El  Salvador.  Mesoamerican  nephropathy  patients 
do not have significant proteinuria, suggesting that this is a disease of 
the kidney tubules and interstitium. The cause is unknown, but some 
have suggested that a combination of toxic environmental factors and 
heat stress underlie the development of this kidney disease, which has 
a striking male predominance. However, the fact that in many families, 
a  large  fraction  of  the  men  have  kidney  disease  has  suggested  that  a 
strong genetic component is involved as well.

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tract316 Tubulointerstitial  

Diseases of the Kidney
Laurence H. Beck Jr., David J. Salant

Inflammation or fibrosis of the renal interstitium and atrophy of the 
tubular compartment are common consequences of diseases that target 
the glomeruli or vasculature. Distinct from these secondary phenom-
ena, however, are a group of disorders that primarily affect the tubules 
and interstitium, with relative sparing of the glomeruli and renal ves-
sels.  Such  disorders  are  conveniently  divided  into  acute  and  chronic 
tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) (Table 316-1).

Acute  TIN  most  often  presents  with  acute  kidney  injury  
(Chap. 310). The acute nature of this group of disorders may be caused 
by aggressive inflammatory infiltrates that lead to tissue edema, tubular 
cell injury, and compromised tubular flow, or by frank obstruction of 
the tubules with casts, cellular debris, or crystals. There is sometimes 
flank pain due to distention of the renal capsule. Urinary sediment is 
often active with leukocytes and cellular casts but depends on the exact 
nature of the disorder in question.

The  clinical  features  of  chronic  TIN  are  more  indolent  and  may 
manifest  with  disorders  of  tubular  function,  including  polyuria  from 
impaired concentrating ability (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), defec-
tive  proximal  tubular  reabsorption  leading  to  features  of  Fanconi’s 
syndrome (glycosuria, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria, hypokalemia, and 
type  II  renal  tubular  acidosis  [RTA]  from  bicarbonaturia),  or  non- 
anion-gap  metabolic  acidosis  and  hyperkalemia  (type  IV  RTA)  due 
to  impaired  ammoniagenesis,  as  well  as  progressive  azotemia  (rising 
creatinine and blood urea nitrogen [BUN]). There is often modest pro-
teinuria (rarely >2 g/d) attributable to decreased tubular reabsorption of 
filtered  proteins;  however,  nephrotic-range  albuminuria  may  occur  in 
some conditions due to the development of secondary focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis  (FSGS).  Renal  ultrasonography  may  reveal  changes 
of  “medical  renal  disease,”  such  as  increased  echogenicity  of  the  renal 
parenchyma  with  loss  of  corticomedullary  differentiation,  prominence 
of  the  renal  pyramids,  and  cortical  scarring  in  some  conditions.  The 
predominant pathology in chronic TIN is interstitial fibrosis with patchy 
mononuclear  cell  infiltration  and  widespread  tubular  atrophy,  luminal 
dilation, and thickening of tubular basement membranes. Because of the 
nonspecific nature of the histopathology, biopsy specimens rarely pro-
vide a specific diagnosis. Thus, diagnosis relies on careful analysis of his-
tory, drug or toxin exposure, associated symptoms, and imaging studies.
ACUTE INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS
In  1897,  Councilman  reported  on  eight  cases  of  acute  interstitial 
nephritis (AIN) in the Medical and Surgical Reports of the Boston City 
Hospital—three  as  a  postinfectious  complication  of  scarlet  fever  and 
two from diphtheria. Later, he described the lesion as “an acute inflam-
mation of the kidney characterized by cellular and fluid exudation in 
the interstitial tissue, accompanied by, but not dependent on, degener-
ation of the epithelium; the exudation is not purulent in character, and 
the lesions may be both diffuse and focal.” Today AIN is far more often 
encountered as an allergic reaction to a drug (Table 316-1). Immune-
mediated  AIN  may  also  occur  as  part  of  a  known  autoimmune  syn-
drome, but in some cases, there is no identifiable cause despite features 
suggestive of an immunologic etiology (Table 316-1).
 ■ ALLERGIC INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS
Although biopsy-proven AIN accounts for no more than ~15% of cases 
of unexplained acute kidney injury, this is likely a substantial under-
estimate  of  the  true  incidence.  This  is  because  potentially  offending 
medications are more often identified and empirically discontinued in 
a patient noted to have a rising serum creatinine, without the benefit of 
a kidney biopsy to establish the diagnosis of AIN.

Clinical Features  The classic presentation of AIN, namely, fever, 
rash,  peripheral  eosinophilia,  and  oliguric  kidney  injury  occurring

after  7–10  days  of  treatment  with  methicillin  or  another  β-lactam 
antibiotic,  is  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule.  More  often,  patients 
are found incidentally to have a rising serum creatinine or present with 
symptoms  attributable  to  acute  kidney  injury  (Chap.  310).  Atypical 
reactions can occur, most notably with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug (NSAID)–induced AIN, in which fever, rash, and eosinophilia are 
rare, but acute kidney injury with heavy proteinuria is common. A par-
ticularly severe and rapid-onset AIN may occur upon reintroduction 
of  rifampin  after  a  drug-free  period.  More  insidious  reactions  to  the 
agents listed in Table 316-1 may lead to progressive tubulointerstitial 
damage. Examples include proton pump inhibitors and, rarely, sulfon-
amide and 5-aminosalicylate (mesalazine and sulfasalazine) derivatives 
and  antiretrovirals.  It  is  not  clear  if  the  recent  association  of  proton 
pump inhibitors with incident chronic kidney disease involves an inter-
mediate step of prolonged, subclinical interstitial nephritis.

Diagnosis  Finding  otherwise  unexplained  kidney  injury  with  or 
without oliguria and exposure to a potentially offending agent usually 
points to the diagnosis. Peripheral blood eosinophilia adds supporting 
evidence but is present in only a minority of patients. Urinalysis reveals 
pyuria with white blood cell casts and hematuria. Urinary eosinophils 
are  neither  sensitive  nor  specific  for  AIN;  therefore,  testing  is  not 
recommended.  Kidney  biopsy  is  generally  not  required  for  diagnosis 
but reveals extensive interstitial and tubular infiltration of leukocytes, 
including eosinophils.

TREATMENT
Allergic Interstitial Nephritis

Discontinuation of the offending agent often leads to reversal of the 
kidney injury. However, depending on the duration of exposure and 
degree of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis that has occurred, 
the kidney damage may not be completely reversible. Glucocorti-
coid therapy may accelerate kidney recovery but does not appear to 
impact long-term kidney survival. It is best reserved for those cases 
with severe kidney injury in which dialysis is imminent or if kidney 
function  continues  to  deteriorate  despite  stopping  the  offending 
drug (Fig. 316-1 and Table 316-2).

 ■ SJÖGREN’S SYNDROME
Sjögren’s  syndrome  is  a  systemic  autoimmune  disorder  that  primar-
ily  targets  the  exocrine  glands,  especially  the  lacrimal  and  salivary 
glands,  and  thus  results  in  symptoms,  such  as  dry  eyes  and  mouth, 
that constitute the “sicca syndrome” (Chap. 361). TIN with a predom-
inant lymphocytic infiltrate is the most common renal manifestation 
of  Sjögren’s  syndrome  and  can  be  associated  with  impaired  kidney 
function, distal RTA, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Diagnosis is 
strongly supported by positive serologic testing for anti-Ro (SS-A) and 
anti-La (SS-B) antibodies. A large proportion of patients with Sjögren’s 
syndrome  also  have  polyclonal  hypergammaglobulinemia.  Treatment 
is initially with glucocorticoids, although patients may require mainte-
nance therapy with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil to prevent 
relapse (Fig. 316-1 and Table 316-2).

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tract ■ TUBULOINTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS  
WITH UVEITIS
Tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (TINU) is a systemic autoim-
mune  disease  of  unknown  etiology.  It  accounts  for  <5%  of  all  cases 
of AIN, affects females three times more often than males, and has a 
median age of onset of 15 years. Its hallmark feature, in addition to a 
lymphocyte-predominant interstitial nephritis (Fig. 316-2), is a painful 
anterior uveitis, often bilateral and accompanied by blurred vision and 
photophobia. Diagnosis is often confounded by the fact that the ocular 
symptoms precede or accompany the kidney disease in only one-third 
of cases. Additional extrarenal features include fever, anorexia, weight 
loss, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. The presence of such symptoms 
as well as elevated creatinine, sterile pyuria, mild proteinuria, features 
of  Fanconi’s  syndrome,  and  elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate 
should  raise  suspicion  for  this  disorder.  Serologies  suggestive  of  the 
more common autoimmune diseases are usually negative, and TINU is 
often a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of uveitis and kidney 
disease, such as Sjögren’s syndrome, Behçet’s disease, sarcoidosis, and 
systemic  lupus  erythematosus,  have  been  considered.  Clinical  symp-
toms are typically self-limited in children but are more apt to follow a 
relapsing course in adults. The renal and ocular manifestations gener-
ally respond well to oral glucocorticoids, although maintenance ther-
apy with agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate 
may be necessary to prevent relapses (Fig. 316-1 and Table 316-2).
 ■ SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS
An  interstitial  mononuclear  cell  inflammatory  reaction  accompanies 
the glomerular lesion in most cases of class III or IV lupus nephritis 
(Chap.  314),  and  deposits  of  immune  complexes  can  be  identified 
in  tubular  basement  membranes  in  ~50%  of  cases.  Occasionally, 
however,  the  tubulointerstitial  inflammation  predominates  and  may 
manifest  with  azotemia  and  type  IV  RTA  rather  than  features  of 
glomerulonephritis.
 ■ GRANULOMATOUS INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS
Some patients may present with features of AIN but follow a protracted 
and  relapsing  course.  Kidney  biopsy  in  such  patients  reveals  a  more 
chronic  inflammatory  infiltrate  with  granulomas  and  multinucleated 
giant cells. Most often, no associated disease or cause is found; how-
ever, some of these cases may have or subsequently develop the pulmo-
nary, cutaneous, or other systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis such as

FIGURE  316-2  Acute  interstitial  nephritis  (AIN)  in  a  patient  who  presented  with 
acute  iritis,  low-grade  fever,  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  of  103,  pyuria  and 
cellular casts on urinalysis, and a newly elevated serum creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL. 
Both the iritis and AIN improved after intravenous methylprednisolone. This PAS-
stained kidney biopsy shows a mononuclear cell interstitial infiltrate (asterisks) and 
edema separating the tubules (T) and a normal glomerulus (G). Some of the tubules 
contain cellular debris and infiltrating inflammatory cells. The findings in this biopsy 
are indistinguishable from those that would be seen in a case of drug-induced AIN.

hypercalcemia. Most patients experience some improvement in kidney 
function if treated early with glucocorticoids before the development of 
significant interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (Table 316-2). Other 
immunosuppressive agents may be required for those who relapse fre-
quently upon steroid withdrawal (Fig. 316-1). Tuberculosis should be 
ruled out before starting treatment because this too is a rare cause of 
granulomatous interstitial nephritis.
 ■ IgG4-RELATED SYSTEMIC DISEASE
A form of AIN characterized by a dense inflammatory infiltrate con-
taining IgG4-expressing plasma cells can occur as a part of a syndrome 
known  as  IgG4-related  systemic  disease  (Chap.  368).  Autoimmune 
pancreatitis,  sclerosing  cholangitis,  retroperitoneal  fibrosis,  and  a 
chronic  sclerosing  sialadenitis  (mimicking  Sjögren’s  syndrome)  may 
variably be present as well. Fibrotic lesions that form pseudotumors in 
the affected organs soon replace the initial inflammatory infiltrates and 
often lead to biopsy or excision for fear of true malignancy. Although 
the  involvement  of  IgG4  in  the  pathogenesis  is  not  understood,  glu-
cocorticoids have been successfully used as first-line treatment in this 
group of disorders, once they are correctly diagnosed.
 ■ AIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF IMMUNE 
CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS
The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has had a major impact in 
cancer care by disrupting mechanisms by which tumor cells elude the 
body’s  immune  surveillance  systems.  However,  such  success  comes 
at  the  cost  of  increasing  the  incidence  of  autoimmune  phenomena. 
While  dermatologic,  gastrointestinal,  and  endocrine  manifestations 
prevail, the kidney is impacted in 2% of cases with monotherapy and 
up to 5% when dual checkpoint inhibitor therapy is used. An acute rise 
in  serum  creatinine  is  typically  noted  within  15  weeks  after  starting 
therapy, although it can occur later during therapy or up to 2 months 
following the final dose. Biopsy, when performed, typically shows acute 
interstitial  inflammation,  although  glomerular  pathologies  may  also 
be found. Patients are often taking medications commonly known to 
cause  acute  drug-associated  TIN  such  as  proton  pump  inhibitors  or 
NSAIDs.  Treatment  for  severe  acute  kidney  injury  includes  corticos-
teroids, discontinuation of potential inciting medications, and avoid-
ance  of  further  checkpoint  inhibitor  doses  until  the  kidney  function 
has recovered.
 ■ IDIOPATHIC AIN
Some  patients  present  with  typical  clinical  and  histologic  features  of 
AIN  but  have  no  evidence  of  drug  exposure  or  clinical  or  serologic 
features of an autoimmune disease. The presence in some cases of auto-
antibodies to a tubular antigen, similar to that identified in rats with 
an induced form of interstitial nephritis, suggests that an autoimmune 
response may be involved. Like TINU and granulomatous interstitial 
nephritis,  idiopathic  AIN  is  responsive  to  glucocorticoid  therapy 
but  may  follow  a  relapsing  course  requiring  maintenance  treatment 
with another immunosuppressive agent (Fig. 316-1 and Table 316-2). 
Recently, cases have been identified in which autoantibodies that may 
be  important  in  disease  pathogenesis  were  seen  to  target  antigens 
expressed by the collecting duct or proximal tubular brush border.
 ■ INFECTION-ASSOCIATED AIN
AIN  may  also  occur  as  a  local  inflammatory  reaction  to  microbial 
infection  (Table  316-1)  and  should  be  distinguished  from  acute  bac-
terial pyelonephritis (Chap. 135). Acute bacterial pyelonephritis does 
not generally cause acute kidney injury unless it affects both kidneys or 
causes septic shock. Presently, infection-associated AIN is most often 
seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly kidney transplant 
recipients with reactivation of polyomavirus BK (Chaps. 143 and 313).

 ■ CRYSTAL DEPOSITION DISORDERS AND 
OBSTRUCTIVE TUBULOPATHIES
Acute  kidney  injury  may  occur  when  crystals  of  various  types  are 
deposited  in  tubular  cells  and  interstitium  or  when  they  obstruct 
tubules.  Impaired  kidney  function,  often  accompanied  by  flank 
pain  from  tubular  obstruction,  may  occur  in  patients  treated  with 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2359

2360 sulfadiazine for toxoplasmosis, indinavir and atazanavir for HIV, and 
intravenous  acyclovir  for  severe  herpesvirus  infections.  Urinalysis 
reveals  “sheaf  of  wheat”  sulfonamide  crystals,  individual  or  parallel 
clusters of needle-shaped indinavir crystals, or red-green birefringent 
needle-shaped crystals of acyclovir. This adverse effect is generally pre-
cipitated by hypovolemia and is reversible with saline volume repletion 
and  drug  withdrawal.  Distinct  from  the  obstructive  disease,  a  frank 
AIN from indinavir crystal deposition has also been reported.

Acute tubular obstruction is also the cause of oliguric kidney injury 
in patients with acute urate nephropathy. It typically results from severe 
hyperuricemia  from  tumor  lysis  syndrome  in  patients  with  lympho- 
or myeloproliferative disorders treated with cytotoxic agents but also 
may  occur  spontaneously  before  the  treatment  has  been  initiated  
(Chap.  75).  Uric  acid  crystallization  in  the  tubules  and  collecting 
system leads to partial or complete obstruction of the collecting ducts, 
renal pelvis, or ureter. A dense precipitate of birefringent uric acid crys-
tals is found in the urine, usually in association with microscopic or 
gross hematuria. Prophylactic allopurinol reduces the risk of uric acid 
nephropathy but is of no benefit once tumor lysis has occurred. Once 
oliguria has developed, attempts to increase tubular flow and solubility 
of  uric  acid  with  alkaline  diuresis  may  be  of  some  benefit;  however, 
emergent treatment with hemodialysis or rasburicase, a recombinant 
urate oxidase, is usually required to rapidly lower uric acid levels and 
restore kidney function.

Calcium oxalate crystal deposition in tubular cells and interstitium 
may  lead  to  permanent  kidney  dysfunction  in  patients  who  survive 
ethylene  glycol  intoxication,  in  patients  with  enteric  hyperoxaluria 
from  ileal  resection  or  small-bowel  bypass  surgery,  and  in  patients 
with hereditary hyperoxaluria (Chap. 318). Acute phosphate nephrop-
athy  is  an  uncommon  but  serious  complication  of  oral  Phosphosoda 
used as a laxative or for bowel preparation for colonoscopy. It results 
from  calcium  phosphate  crystal  deposition  in  tubules  and  intersti-
tium and occurs especially in subjects with underlying kidney disease 
and  hypovolemia.  Consequently,  Phosphosoda  should  be  avoided  in 
patients with chronic kidney disease.

 ■ LIGHT CHAIN CAST NEPHROPATHY
Patients  with  multiple  myeloma  may  develop  acute  kidney  injury 
in  the  setting  of  hypovolemia,  infection,  or  hypercalcemia  or  after 
exposure to NSAIDs or radiographic contrast media. The diagnosis of 
light chain cast nephropathy (LCCN)—commonly known as myeloma 
kidney—should be considered in patients who fail to recover when the 
precipitating factor is corrected or in any elderly patient with otherwise 
unexplained acute kidney injury.

In  this  disorder,  filtered  monoclonal  immunoglobulin  light  chains 
(Bence-Jones  proteins)  form  intratubular  aggregates  with  secreted 
Tamm-Horsfall  protein  in  the  distal  tubule.  Casts,  in  addition  to 
obstructing  the  tubular  flow  in  affected  nephrons,  incite  a  giant  cell 
or  foreign-body  reaction  and  can  lead  to  tubular  rupture,  resulting 
in  interstitial  fibrosis  (Fig.  316-3).  Although  LCCN  generally  occurs 
in  patients  with  known  multiple  myeloma  and  a  large  plasma  cell 
burden, the disorder should also be considered as a possible diagnosis 
in  patients  who  have  known  monoclonal  gammopathy  even  in  the 
absence of frank myeloma. Filtered monoclonal light chains may also 
cause less pronounced renal manifestations in the absence of obstruc-
tion, due to direct toxicity to proximal tubular cells and intracellular 
crystal formation. This may result in isolated tubular disorders such as 
RTA or full Fanconi’s syndrome.

Diagnosis  Clinical  clues  to  the  diagnosis  include  anemia,  bone 
pain,  hypercalcemia,  and  an  abnormally  narrow  anion  gap  due  to 
hypoalbuminemia  and  hypergammaglobulinemia.  Urinary  dipsticks 
detect albumin but not immunoglobulin light chains; however, labo-
ratory detection of increased amounts of protein in a spot urine speci-
men and a negative dipstick result are highly suggestive that the urine 
contains Bence-Jones protein. Serum and urine should both be sent for 
protein electrophoresis and for immunofixation for the detection and 
identification  of  a  potential  monoclonal  band.  A  sensitive  method  is 
available to detect urine and serum free light chains.

FIGURE 316-3  Histologic appearance of myeloma cast nephropathy. A hematoxylin-
eosin–stained kidney biopsy shows many atrophic tubules filled with eosinophilic 
casts  (consisting  of  Bence-Jones  protein),  which  are  surrounded  by  giant  cell 
reactions. (Courtesy of Dr. Michael N. Koss, University of Southern California Keck 
School of Medicine; with permission.)

TREATMENT
Light Chain Cast Nephropathy

The goals of treatment are to correct precipitating factors such as 
hypovolemia and hypercalcemia, discontinue potential nephrotoxic 
agents, and treat the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia (Chap. 111); 
plasmapheresis to remove light chains is of questionable value for 
LCCN.

 ■ LYMPHOMATOUS INFILTRATION OF THE KIDNEY
Interstitial  infiltration  by  malignant  B  lymphocytes  is  a  common 
autopsy  finding  in  patients  dying  of  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia 
and  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma;  however,  this  is  usually  an  incidental 
finding. Rarely, such infiltrates may cause massive enlargement of the 
kidneys and oliguric acute kidney injury. Although high-dose gluco-
corticoids  and  subsequent  chemotherapy  often  result  in  recovery  of 
kidney function, the prognosis in such cases is generally poor.

CHRONIC TUBULOINTERSTITIAL 
DISEASES
Improved occupational and public health measures, together with the 
banning of over-the-counter phenacetin-containing analgesics, has led 
to a dramatic decline in the incidence of chronic interstitial nephritis 
(CIN)  from  heavy  metal—particularly  lead  and  cadmium—exposure 
and  analgesic  nephropathy  in  North  America.  Today,  CIN  is  most 
often the result of renal ischemia or secondary to a primary glomerular 
disease (Chap. 314). Other important forms of CIN are the result of 
developmental anomalies or inherited diseases such as reflux nephrop-
athy or sickle cell nephropathy and may not be recognized until ado-
lescence or adulthood. Although it is impossible to reverse damage that 
has already occurred, further deterioration may be prevented or at least 
slowed in such cases by treating glomerular hypertension, a common 
denominator in the development of secondary FSGS and progressive 
loss of functioning nephrons. Therefore, awareness and early detection 
of patients at risk may prevent them from developing end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD).
 ■ VESICOURETERAL REFLUX AND  
REFLUX NEPHROPATHY
Reflux nephropathy is the consequence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) 
or other urologic anomalies in early childhood. It was previously called 
chronic  pyelonephritis  because  it  was  believed  to  result  from  recur-
rent  urinary  tract  infections  (UTIs)  in  childhood.  VUR  stems  from

abnormal  retrograde  urine  flow  from  the  bladder  into  one  or  both 
ureters and kidneys because of mislocated and incompetent ureterove-
sical  valves  (Fig.  316-4).  Although  high-pressure  sterile  reflux  may 
impair  normal  growth  of  the  kidneys,  when  coupled  with  recurrent 
UTIs  in  early  childhood,  the  result  is  patchy  interstitial  scarring  and 
tubular atrophy. Loss of functioning nephrons leads to hypertrophy of 
the remnant glomeruli and eventual secondary FSGS. Reflux nephrop-
athy often goes unnoticed until early adulthood when chronic kidney 
disease  is  detected  during  routine  evaluation  or  during  pregnancy. 
Affected adults are frequently asymptomatic but may give a history of 
prolonged bed-wetting or recurrent UTIs during childhood and may 
exhibit variable degrees of kidney injury as well as hypertension, mild 
to moderate proteinuria, and an unremarkable urine sediment. When 
both kidneys are affected, the disease often progresses inexorably over 

several  years  to  ESRD,  despite  the  absence  of  ongoing  urinary  infec-
tions or reflux. A single affected kidney may go undetected, except for 
the presence of hypertension. Kidney ultrasound in adults characteris-
tically shows asymmetric small kidneys with irregular outlines, thinned 
cortices, and regions of compensatory hypertrophy (Fig. 316-4).

TREATMENT
Vesicoureteral Reflux and Reflux Nephropathy

Maintenance  of  sterile  urine  in  childhood  has  been  shown  to 
limit  scarring  of  the  kidneys.  Surgical  reimplantation  of  the  ure-
ters  into  the  bladder  to  restore  competency  is  indicated  in  young 
children with persistent high-grade reflux but is ineffective and is

not indicated in adolescents or adults after scarring has occurred. 
Aggressive control of blood pressure with an angiotensin-converting 
enzyme  inhibitor  (ACEI)  or  angiotensin  receptor  blocker  (ARB) 
and other agents is effective in reducing proteinuria and may sig-
nificantly forestall further deterioration of kidney function.

 ■ SICKLE CELL NEPHROPATHY
The  pathogenesis  and  clinical  manifestations  of  sickle  cell  nephrop-
athy  are  described  in  Chap.  317.  Evidence  of  tubular  injury  may  be 
evident  in  childhood  and  early  adolescence  in  the  form  of  polyuria 
due  to  decreased  concentrating  ability  or  type  IV  RTA  years  before 
there is significant nephron loss and proteinuria from secondary FSGS. 
Early recognition of these subtle renal abnormalities or development 
of  microalbuminuria  in  a  child  with  sickle  cell  disease  may  warrant 
consultation with a nephrologist and/or therapy with low-dose ACEIs. 
Papillary necrosis may result from ischemia due to sickling of red cells 
in the relatively hypoxemic and hypertonic medullary vasculature and 
present  with  gross  hematuria  and  ureteric  obstruction  by  sloughed 
ischemic papillae (Table 316-3).
 ■ TUBULOINTERSTITIAL ABNORMALITIES 
ASSOCIATED WITH GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
Primary glomerulopathies are often associated with damage to tubules 
and interstitium. This may occasionally be due to the same pathologic 
process affecting the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium, as is the case 
with immune-complex deposition in lupus nephritis. More often, how-
ever,  chronic  tubulointerstitial  changes  occur  as  a  secondary  conse-
quence of prolonged glomerular dysfunction. Potential mechanisms by 
which glomerular disease might cause tubulointerstitial injury include 
proteinuria-mediated damage to the epithelial cells, activation of tubu-
lar cells by cytokines and complement, or reduced peritubular blood 
flow  leading  to  downstream  tubulointerstitial  ischemia,  especially  in 
the case of glomeruli that are globally obsolescent due to severe glom-
erulonephritis. It is often difficult to discern the initial cause of injury 
by  kidney  biopsy  in  a  patient  who  presents  with  advanced  kidney 
disease in this setting.
 ■ ANALGESIC NEPHROPATHY
Analgesic  nephropathy  results  from  the  long-term  use  of  compound 
analgesic  preparations  containing  phenacetin  (banned  in  the  United 
States since 1983), aspirin, and caffeine. In its classic form, analgesic 
nephropathy  is  characterized  by  impaired  kidney  function,  papillary 
necrosis  (Table  316-3)  attributable  to  the  presumed  concentration  of 
the drug to toxic levels in the inner medulla, and a radiographic con-
stellation  of  small,  scarred  kidneys  with  papillary  calcifications  best 
appreciated by computed tomography (Fig. 316-5). Patients may also 
have polyuria due to impaired concentrating ability and non-anion-gap 
metabolic  acidosis  from  tubular  damage.  Shedding  of  a  sloughed 
necrotic  papilla  can  cause  gross  hematuria  and  ureteric  colic  due  to 
ureteral  obstruction.  Individuals  with  ESRD  as  a  result  of  analgesic 
nephropathy are at increased risk of a urothelial malignancy compared 
to patients with other causes of kidney failure. Recent cohort studies 
in individuals with normal baseline kidney function suggest that the 
moderate chronic use of current analgesic preparations available in the 
United States, including acetaminophen and NSAIDs, does not seem 
to cause the constellation of findings known as analgesic nephropathy, 
although volume-depleted individuals and those with chronic kidney 
disease are at higher risk of NSAID-related renal toxicity. Nonetheless, 
it is recommended that heavy users of acetaminophen and NSAIDs be 
screened for evidence of kidney disease.

 ■ ARISTOLOCHIC ACID NEPHROPATHY
Two seemingly unrelated forms of CIN, Chinese herbal nephropathy 
and  Balkan  endemic  nephropathy,  have  recently  been  linked  by  the 
underlying  etiologic  agent  aristolochic  acid  and  are  now  collectively 
termed aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN). In Chinese herbal neph-
ropathy, first described in the early 1990s in young women taking tra-
ditional Chinese herbal preparations as part of a weight-loss regimen, 
one of the offending agents has been identified as aristolochic acid, a 
known  carcinogen  from  the  plant  Aristolochia.  Multiple  Aristolochia 
species  have  been  used  in  traditional  herbal  remedies  for  centuries 
and continue to be available despite official bans on their use in many 
countries. Molecular evidence has also implicated aristolochic acid in 
Balkan endemic nephropathy, a chronic TIN found primarily in towns 
along  the  tributaries  of  the  Danube  River  and  first  described  in  the 
1950s.  Although  the  exact  route  of  exposure  is  not  known  with  cer-
tainty, contamination of local grain preparations with the seeds of Aris-
tolochia  species  seems  most  likely.  Aristolochic  acid,  after  prolonged 
exposure, produces renal interstitial fibrosis with a relative paucity of 
cellular  infiltrates.  The  urine  sediment  is  bland,  with  rare  leukocytes 
and only mild proteinuria. Anemia may be disproportionately severe 
relative to the level of kidney dysfunction. Definitive diagnosis of AAN 
requires  two  of  the  following  three  features:  characteristic  histology 
on  kidney  biopsy;  confirmation  of  aristolochic  acid  ingestion;  and 
detection  of  aristolactam-DNA  adducts  in  kidney  or  urinary  tract 
tissue.  These  latter  lesions  represent  a  molecular  signature  of  aristo-
lochic  acid–derived  DNA  damage  and  often  consist  of  characteristic 
A:T-to-T:A  transversions.  Due  to  this  mutagenic  activity,  AAN  is 
associated with a very high incidence of upper urinary tract urothelial 
cancers, with risk related to cumulative dose. Surveillance with com-
puted tomography, ureteroscopy, and urine cytology is warranted, and 
consideration should be given to bilateral nephroureterectomy once a 
patient has reached ESRD.

 ■ KARYOMEGALIC INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS
Karyomegalic  interstitial  nephritis  is  an  unusual  form  of  slowly  pro-
gressive  chronic  kidney  disease  with  mild  proteinuria,  interstitial 
fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and oddly enlarged nuclei of proximal tubular 
epithelial  cells.  It  has  been  linked  to  mutations  in  FAN1,  a  nuclease 
involved  in  DNA  repair,  which  may  render  carriers  of  the  mutation 
susceptible to environmental DNA-damaging agents.

 ■ LITHIUM-ASSOCIATED NEPHROPATHY
The  use  of  lithium  salts  for  the  treatment  of  manic-depressive  ill-
ness  may  have  several  renal  sequelae,  the  most  common  of  which 
is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus manifesting as polyuria and poly-
dipsia. Lithium accumulates in principal cells of the collecting duct 
by entering through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), where it

inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β and downregulates vasopressin- 
regulated aquaporin water channels. Less frequently, chronic TIN 
develops  after  prolonged  (>10–20  years)  lithium  use  and  is  most 
likely  to  occur  in  patients  who  have  experienced  repeated  episodes 
of toxic lithium levels. Findings on kidney biopsy include interstitial 
fibrosis and tubular atrophy that are out of proportion to the degree 
of glomerulosclerosis or vascular disease, a sparse lymphocytic infil-
trate,  and  small  cysts  or  dilation  of  the  distal  tubule  and  collecting 
duct  that  are  highly  characteristic  of  this  disorder.  The  degree  of 
interstitial  fibrosis  correlates  with  both  duration  and  cumulative 
dose  of  lithium.  Individuals  with  lithium-associated  nephropathy 
are  typically  asymptomatic,  with  minimal  proteinuria,  few  urinary 
leukocytes, and normal blood pressure. Some patients develop more 
severe proteinuria due to secondary FSGS, which may contribute to 
further loss of kidney function.

TREATMENT
Lithium-Associated Nephropathy

Kidney  function  should  be  followed  regularly  in  patients  taking 
lithium,  and  caution  should  be  exercised  in  patients  with  under-
lying kidney disease. The use of amiloride to inhibit lithium entry 
via ENaC has been effective to prevent and treat lithium-induced 
nephrogenic  diabetes  insipidus,  but  it  is  not  clear  if  it  will  pre-
vent lithium-induced CIN. Once lithium-associated nephropathy is 
detected, the discontinuation of lithium in attempt to forestall fur-
ther deterioration of kidney function can be problematic, as lithium 
is an effective mood stabilizer that is often incompletely substituted 
by  other  agents.  Furthermore,  despite  discontinuation  of  lithium, 
chronic kidney disease in such patients is often irreversible and can 
slowly progress to ESRD. The most prudent approach is to monitor 
lithium  levels  frequently  and  adjust  dosing  to  avoid  toxic  levels 
(preferably <1 meq/L). This is especially important because lithium 
is cleared less effectively as kidney function declines.

 ■ CALCINEURIN INHIBITOR NEPHROTOXICITY
The calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) immunosuppressive agents cyclospo-
rine  and  tacrolimus  can  cause  both  acute  and  chronic  kidney  injury. 
Acute forms can result from vascular causes such as vasoconstriction 
or the development of thrombotic microangiopathy or can be due to 
a  toxic  tubulopathy.  Chronic  CNI-induced  kidney  injury  is  typically 
seen in solid organ (including heart-lung and liver) transplant recipi-
ents and manifests with a slow but irreversible reduction of glomerular 
filtration rate, with mild proteinuria and arterial hypertension. Hyper-
kalemia  is  a  relatively  common  complication  and  is  caused,  in  part, 
by tubular resistance to aldosterone. The histologic changes in kidney 
tissue include patchy interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, often in a 
“striped” pattern. In addition, the intrarenal vasculature often demon-
strates hyalinosis, and focal glomerulosclerosis can be present as well. 
Similar changes may occur in patients receiving CNIs for autoimmune 
diseases,  although  the  doses  are  generally  lower  than  those  used  for 
organ  transplantation.  Dose  reduction  or  CNI  avoidance  appears  to 
mitigate  the  chronic  tubulointerstitial  changes  but  may  increase  the 
risk of rejection and graft loss.

 ■ HEAVY METAL (LEAD) NEPHROPATHY
Heavy metals, such as lead or cadmium, can lead to a chronic tubu-
lointerstitial process after prolonged exposure. The disease entity is no 
longer commonly diagnosed, because such heavy metal exposure has 
been greatly reduced due to the known health risks from lead and the 
consequent removal of lead from most commercial products and fuels. 
Nonetheless, occupational exposure is possible in workers involved in 
the manufacture or destruction of batteries, removal of lead paint, or 
manufacture of alloys and electrical equipment (cadmium) in countries 
where industrial regulation is less stringent. In addition, ingestion of 
moonshine  whiskey  distilled  in  lead-tainted  containers  has  been  one 
of the more frequent sources of lead exposure.

Early signs of chronic lead intoxication are attributable to proximal 
tubule  dysfunction,  particularly  hyperuricemia  as  a  result  of  dimin-
ished urate secretion. The triad of “saturnine gout,” hypertension, and 
impaired kidney function should prompt a practitioner to ask specif-
ically  about  lead  exposure.  Unfortunately,  evaluating  lead  burden  is 
not as straightforward as ordering a blood test; the preferred methods 
involve measuring urinary lead after infusion of a chelating agent or by 
radiographic  fluoroscopy  of  bone.  Several  recent  studies  have  shown 
an association between chronic low-level lead exposure and decreased 
kidney  function,  although  either  of  these  two  factors  may  have  been 
the primary event. In patients who have CIN of unclear origin and an 
elevated total body lead burden, repeated treatments of lead chelation 
therapy have been shown to slow the decline in kidney function.

METABOLIC DISORDERS
Disorders  leading  to  excessively  high  or  low  levels  of  certain  elec-
trolytes  and  products  of  metabolism  can  also  lead  to  chronic  kidney 
disease if untreated.

 ■ CHRONIC URIC ACID NEPHROPATHY
The constellation of pathologic findings that represent gouty nephropa-
thy is very uncommon nowadays and is more of historical interest than 
clinical importance, as gout is typically well managed with allopurinol 
and  other  agents.  However,  there  is  emerging  evidence  that  hyperu-
ricemia is an independent risk factor for the development of chronic 
kidney  disease,  perhaps  through  endothelial  damage.  The  complex 
interactions of hyperuricemia, hypertension, and kidney failure are still 
incompletely understood.

Presently,  gouty  nephropathy  is  most  likely  to  be  encountered  in 
patients  with  severe  tophaceous  gout  and  prolonged  hyperuricemia 
from  a  hereditary  disorder  of  purine  metabolism  (Chap.  417).  This 
should  be  distinguished  from  juvenile  hyperuricemic  nephropathy, 
a  form  of  medullary  cystic  kidney  disease  caused  by  mutations  in 
uromodulin  (UMOD)  (Chap.  315)  and  now  grouped  into  the  larger 
category of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease. His-
tologically, the distinctive feature of gouty nephropathy is the presence 
of crystalline deposits of uric acid and monosodium urate salts in the 
kidney parenchyma. These deposits not only cause intrarenal obstruc-
tion but also incite an inflammatory response, leading to lymphocytic 
infiltration,  foreign-body  giant  cell  reaction,  and  eventual  fibrosis, 
especially in the medullary and papillary regions of the kidney. Since 
patients with gout frequently suffer from hypertension and hyperlip-
idemia,  degenerative  changes  of  the  renal  arterioles  may  constitute  a 
striking feature of the histologic abnormality, out of proportion to the 
other morphologic defects. Clinically, gouty nephropathy is an insid-
ious  cause  of  chronic  kidney  disease.  Early  in  its  course,  glomerular 
filtration rate may be near normal, often despite morphologic changes 
in  medullary  and  cortical  interstitium,  proteinuria,  and  diminished 
urinary  concentrating  ability.  Treatment  with  allopurinol  and  urine 
alkalinization is generally effective in preventing uric acid nephrolith-
iasis and the consequences of recurrent kidney stones; however, gouty 
nephropathy  may  be  intractable  to  such  measures.  Furthermore,  the 
use of allopurinol in asymptomatic hyperuricemia has not been con-
sistently shown to improve kidney function.

 ■ HYPERCALCEMIC NEPHROPATHY
(See  also  Chap.  410)  Chronic  hypercalcemia,  as  occurs  in  primary 
hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, multiple myeloma, vitamin D intox-
ication, or metastatic bone disease, can cause tubulointerstitial disease 
and progressive kidney injury. The earliest lesion is a focal degenerative 
change in renal epithelia, primarily in collecting ducts, distal tubules, 
and loops of Henle. Tubular cell necrosis leads to nephron obstruction 
and  stasis  of  intrarenal  urine,  favoring  local  precipitation  of  calcium 
salts and infection. Dilation and atrophy of tubules eventually occur, as 
do  interstitial  fibrosis,  mononuclear  leukocyte  infiltration,  and  inter-
stitial calcium deposition (nephrocalcinosis). Calcium deposition may 
also occur in glomeruli and the walls of renal arterioles.

Clinically, the most striking defect is an inability to maximally con-
centrate  the  urine,  due  to  reduced  collecting  duct  responsiveness  to

2364 arginine  vasopressin  and  defective  transport  of  sodium  and  chloride 
in the loop of Henle. Reductions in both glomerular filtration rate and 
renal blood flow can occur, both in acute and in prolonged hypercal-
cemia.  Eventually,  uncontrolled  hypercalcemia  leads  to  severe  tubu-
lointerstitial damage and overt kidney injury. Abdominal x-rays may 
demonstrate nephrocalcinosis as well as nephrolithiasis, the latter due 
to the hypercalciuria that often accompanies hypercalcemia.

Treatment  consists  of  reducing  the  serum  calcium  concentration 
toward  normal  and  correcting  the  primary  abnormality  of  calcium 
metabolism (Chap. 410). Acute kidney injury from acute hypercalce-
mia may be completely reversible. Gradual progressive kidney dysfunc-
tion related to chronic hypercalcemia, however, may not improve even 
with correction of the calcium disorder.

 ■ HYPOKALEMIC NEPHROPATHY
Patients with prolonged and severe hypokalemia from chronic laxative 
or  diuretic  abuse,  surreptitious  vomiting,  or  primary  aldosteronism 
may  develop  a  reversible  tubular  lesion  characterized  by  vacuolar 
degeneration  of  proximal  and  distal  tubular  cells.  Eventually,  tubular 
atrophy  and  cystic  dilation  accompanied  by  interstitial  fibrosis  may 
ensue, leading to irreversible chronic kidney disease. Timely correction 
of  the  hypokalemia  will  prevent  further  progression,  but  persistent 
hypokalemia can cause ESRD.

GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
The causes of acute and CIN vary widely across the globe. Analgesic 
nephropathy  continues  to  be  seen  in  countries  where  phenacetin-
containing  compound  analgesic  preparations  are  readily  available. 
Adulterants  in  unregulated  herbal  and  traditional  medicaments  pose 
a  threat  of  toxic  interstitial  nephritis,  as  exemplified  by  aristolochic 
acid  contamination  of  herbal  slimming  preparations.  Contamination 
of  food  sources  with  toxins,  such  as  an  outbreak  of  nephrolithiasis 
and acute kidney injury from melamine contamination of infant milk 
formula, poses a continuing risk. Large-scale exposure to aristolochic 
acid  remains  prevalent  in  many  Asian  countries  where  traditional 
herbal medicine use is common. Although industrial exposure to lead 
and cadmium has largely disappeared as a cause of CIN in developed 
nations,  it  remains  a  risk  for  nephrotoxicity  in  countries  where  such 
exposure is less well controlled.

New  endemic  forms  of  chronic  kidney  disease  continue  to  be 
described. In particular, nephropathies with features of CIN have been 
increasing  in  prevalence  among  Pacific  coastal  plantation  workers  in 
Central America (Mesoamerican nephropathy), Sri Lanka (Sri Lankan 
nephropathy), and southern India (Uddanam nephropathy). Together, 
these disorders have been called chronic interstitial nephritis of agri-
cultural  communities  (CINAC)  and  may  be  related  to  repetitive  epi-
sodes of heat exposure, dehydration, and volume depletion in the field 
workers. However, toxins, pesticides, and infective agents also remain 
as possible etiologic agents. Global warming and regional temperature 
variability have been proposed as contributors to these newly described 
forms of kidney disease, and tens of thousands of lives have been lost 
due to ESRD in these resource-poor areas in which renal replacement 
therapy is often not an option.

317 Vascular Injury  
to the Kidney
Ronald S. Go, Nelson Leung

The  renal  circulation  is  complex  and  is  characterized  by  a  highly 
perfused  arteriolar  network,  reaching  cortical  glomerular  structures 
adjacent  to  lower-flow  vasa  recta  that  descend  into  medullary  seg-
ments. Disorders of the larger vessels, including renal artery stenosis 
and atheroembolic disease, are discussed elsewhere (Chap. 278). This 
chapter examines primary disorders of the renal microvessels, many of 
which are associated with thrombosis and hemolysis.

THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a pathologic lesion character-
ized by endothelial cell injury in the terminal arterioles and capillaries. 
Platelet and hyaline thrombi causing partial or complete occlusion are 
integral to the histopathology of TMA. TMA is usually accompanied by 
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with its typical features 
of thrombocytopenia and schistocytes, but not always. In the kidney, 
TMA  is  characterized  by  swollen  endocapillary  cells  (endotheliosis), 
fibrin thrombi, platelet plugs, arterial intimal fibrosis, and a membra-
noproliferative pattern in the glomerulus. Fibrin thrombi may extend 
into  the  arteriolar  vascular  pole,  producing  glomerular  collapse  and 
at  times  cortical  necrosis.  In  kidneys  that  recover  from  acute  TMA, 
secondary  focal  segmental  glomerulosclerosis  may  develop.  Diseases 
associated  with  this  lesion  include  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic 
purpura  (TTP),  hemolytic-uremic  syndrome  (HUS),  malignant 
hypertension,  scleroderma  renal  crisis,  antiphospholipid  syndrome,  
preeclampsia/HELLP  (hemolysis,  elevated  liver  enzymes,  low  platelet 
count) syndrome, HIV infection, and radiation nephropathy. TMA can 
also be seen in myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)–related glomeru-
lopathy and POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, 
monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) syndrome, which are not 
associated with MAHA.

 ■ HEMOLYTIC-UREMIC SYNDROME/THROMBOTIC 
THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA
HUS  and  TTP  are  the  prototypes  for  MAHA.  Historically,  HUS  and 
TTP  were  distinguished  mainly  by  their  clinical  and  epidemiologic 
differences. TTP develops more commonly in adults and was thought 
to have more neurologic complications, while HUS occurs more fre-
quently  in  children,  particularly  when  associated  with  hemorrhagic 
diarrhea. However, atypical HUS (aHUS) can have its first appearance 
in adulthood, and neurologic involvement can be as common in HUS 
as in TTP. Currently, HUS and TTP can be differentiated etiologically 
and treated according to their specific pathophysiologic features.

Hemolytic-Uremic  Syndrome  HUS  is  loosely  defined  by  the 
presence  of  MAHA  and  renal  impairment.  At  least  four  variants  are 
recognized.  The  most  common  is  Shiga  toxin–producing  Escherichia 
coli  (STEC)  HUS,  which  is  also  known  as  D+  (diarrhea-associated) 
HUS  or  enterohemorrhagic  E.  coli  (EHEC)  HUS.  Most  cases  involve 
children <5 years of age, but adults also are susceptible, as evidenced by 
a 2011 outbreak in northern Europe. Diarrhea, often bloody, precedes 
MAHA within 1 week in >80% of cases. Abdominal pain, cramping, 
and vomiting are frequent, whereas fever is typically absent. Neurologic 
symptoms, including dysphasia, hyperreflexia, blurred vision, memory 
deficits,  encephalopathy,  perseveration,  and  agraphia,  often  develop, 
especially  in  adults.  Seizures  and  cerebral  infarction  can  occur  in 
severe cases. STEC HUS is caused by the Shiga toxins (Stx1 and Stx2), 
which are also referred to as verotoxins. These toxins are produced by 
certain strains of E. coli and Shigella dysenteriae. In the United States 
and Europe, the most common STEC strain is O157:H7, but HUS has 
been  reported  with  other  strains  (O157/H–,  O111:H–,  O26:H11/H–, 
O145:H28, and O104:H4). After entry into the circulation, Shiga toxin

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractbinds to the glycolipid surface receptor globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), 
which is richly expressed on cells of the renal microvasculature. Upon 
binding,  the  toxin  enters  the  cells,  inducing  inflammatory  cytokines 
(interleukin  8  [IL-8],  monocyte  chemotactic  protein  1  [MCP-1], 
and  stromal  cell–derived  factor  1  [SDF-1])  and  chemokine  receptors 
(CXCR4  and  CXCR7);  this  action  results  in  platelet  aggregation  and 
the  microangiopathic  process.  Streptococcus  pneumoniae  can  also 
cause HUS. Certain strains produce a neuraminidase that cleaves the  
N-acetylneuraminic  acid  moieties  normally  covering  the  Thomsen-
Friedenreich antigen on platelets and endothelial cells. Exposure of this 
cryptic antigen to preformed IgM results in severe MAHA.

aHUS  or  complement-mediated  HUS  is  the  result  of  complement 
dysregulation.  The  complement  dysregulation  can  be  congenital  or 
acquired. The affected patients often have low C3 and normal C4 levels 
characteristic  of  alternative  pathway  activation.  Factor  H  deficiency, 
the  most  common  defect,  has  been  linked  to  families  with  aHUS. 
Factor H competes with factor B to prevent the formation of C3bBb 
and acts as a cofactor for factor I, which proteolytically degrades C3b. 
More than 70 mutations of the factor H gene have been identified. Most 
are missense mutations that produce abnormalities in the C-terminus 
region,  affecting  its  binding  to  C3b  but  not  its  concentration.  Other 
mutations result in low levels or the complete absence of the protein. 
Deficiencies  in  other  complement-regulatory  proteins,  such  as  fac-
tor  I,  factor  B,  membrane  cofactor  protein  (CD46),  C3,  complement 
factor  H  (CFH)–related  protein  1  (CFHR1),  CFHR3,  CFHR5,  and 
thrombomodulin,  have  also  been  reported.  Finally,  an  autoimmune 
variant  of  aHUS,  DEAP  (deficiency  of  CFHR  plasma  proteins  and 
CFH  autoantibody  positive)  HUS,  occurs  when  an  autoantibody  to 
factor H is formed. DEAP HUS is often associated with a deletion of 
an  84-kb  fragment  of  the  chromosome  that  encodes  for  CFHR1  and 
CFHR3. The autoantibody blocks the binding of factor H to C3b and 
surface-bound C3 convertase. Renal injury is often severe, resulting in 
end-stage renal disease. The severity of the renal injury and recurrence 
after kidney transplant depend on the complement regulatory protein.

Thrombotic  Thrombocytopenic  Purpura  Traditionally,  TTP 
is  characterized  by  the  pentad  of  MAHA,  thrombocytopenia,  neuro-
logic symptoms, fever, and renal failure. The pathophysiology of TTP 
involves the accumulation of ultra-large multimers of von Willebrand 
factor as a result of the absence or markedly decreased activity of the 
plasma protease ADAMTS13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with 
a  thrombospondin  type  1  motif,  member  13.  TTP  is  now  defined  as 
MAHA associated with ADAMTS13 activity of (<5–10%). These ultra-
large multimers form clots and shear erythrocytes, resulting in MAHA; 
however, the absence of ADAMTS13 alone may not by itself produce 
TTP.  Often,  an  additional  inflammatory  trigger  (such  as  infection, 
surgery, pancreatitis, or pregnancy) is required to initiate clinical TTP. 
This may be mediated by human neutrophil peptides that inhibit cleav-
age of von Willebrand factor by ADAMTS13. TTP can be congenital 
from  ADAMTS13  mutation  (cTTP)  or  acquired  from  autoantibody 
against ADAMTS13 protein (iTTP).

cTTP, also known as Upshaw-Schülman syndrome, is characterized 
by congenital deficiency of ADAMTS13. cTTP can start within the first 
weeks of life but, in some instances, may not present until adulthood, 
especially during pregnancy. Both environmental and genetic factors are 
thought to influence the development of cTTP. Plasma transfusion is an 
effective strategy for prevention and treatment. In iTTP, autoantibody 
to ADAMTS13 (IgG or IgM) either increases its clearance or inhibits its 
activity. Data from the Oklahoma TTP/HUS Registry suggest an iTTP 
incidence rate of 2.9 cases/106 patients in the United States. The median 
age of onset is 40 years. The incidence is more than nine times higher 
among blacks than nonblacks. Like that of systemic lupus erythemato-
sus, the incidence of iTTP is nearly three times higher among women 
than  among  men.  If  untreated,  iTTP  has  a  mortality  rate  exceeding 
90%. Even with modern therapy, 20% of patients die within the first 
month from complications of microvascular thrombosis.

Drug-induced  TMA  is  a  recognized  complication  of  treatment 
with some chemotherapeutic agents, immunosuppressive agents, and 
quinine.  Two  different  mechanisms  are  now  recognized.  Toxic  or 

2365

endothelial damage (pathologically similar to that of HUS) is the main 
cause  of  the  TMA  that  develops  in  association  with  chemotherapeu-
tic  agents  (e.g.,  proteasome  inhibitors  [bortezomib,  carfilzomib,  and 
ixazomib],  mitomycin  C,  and  gemcitabine)  and  immunosuppressive 
agents  (cyclosporine,  interferon,  sirolimus,  and  tacrolimus).  This 
process is usually dose-dependent. Alternatively, TMA may develop as 
a result of drug-induced autoantibodies. This form is less likely to be 
dose-dependent and can, in fact, occur after a single dose in patients 
with previous exposure (quinine). ADAMTS13 deficiency is found in 
fewer  than  half  of  patients  with  clopidogrel-associated  TTP.  Quinine 
appears to induce autoantibodies to granulocytes, lymphocytes, endo-
thelial cells, and platelet glycoprotein Ib/IX or IIb/IIIa complexes, but 
not to ADAMTS13. Quinine-associated TTP is more common among 
women. TMA has also been reported with drugs that inhibit vascular 
endothelial growth factor, such as bevacizumab; the mechanism is not 
completely understood.

TREATMENT
Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic 
Thrombocytopenic Purpura

Treatment  should  be  based  on  pathophysiology.  iTTP  and  DEAP 
HUS respond to the combination of plasma exchange and predni-
sone. In addition to removing the autoantibodies, plasma exchange 
with fresh-frozen plasma replaces ADAMTS13. Twice-daily plasma 
exchanges  with  administration  of  rituximab  may  be  effective  in 
refractory cases. The use of caplacizumab, a monoclonal antibody 
fragment  that  binds  to  the  A1  domain  of  von  Willebrand  fac-
tor,  blocking  its  interaction  with  platelets,  was  recently  shown  to 
improve platelet count recovery and reduce the composite risk of 
death, disease exacerbation, and thromboembolic events. It is now 
approved for use in iTTP in conjunction with plasma exchange and 
immunosuppressive  therapy.  Plasma  infusion  is  usually  sufficient 
to  replace  the  ADAMTS13  in  cTTP.  Plasma  exchange  should  be 
considered if larger volumes are necessary.

Plasma infusion/exchange is effective in certain types of aHUS 
because  it  replaces  complement-regulatory  proteins.  Eculizumab 
and ravulizumab, anti-C5 monoclonal antibodies, are approved for 
use in aHUS, and have been shown to abort MAHA and improve 
renal  function.  Antibiotics  and  washed  red  cells  should  be  given 
in  neuraminidase-associated  HUS,  and  plasmapheresis  may  be 
helpful;  however,  plasma  and  whole-blood  transfusion  should  be 
avoided  since  these  products  contain  IgM,  which  may  exacerbate 
MAHA. Combined factor H and ADAMTS13 deficiency has been 
reported.  The  affected  patients  are  generally  less  responsive  to 
plasma infusion, an outcome that illustrates the complexity of the 
management of these cases.

Drug-induced TMA secondary to endothelial damage typically 
does  not  respond  to  plasma  exchange  and  is  treated  primarily  by 
discontinuing the use of the agent and, if refractory, a trial of C5 
inhibitors. Similarly, STEC HUS should be treated with supportive 
measures  as  plasma  exchange  has  not  been  found  to  be  effective. 
Antimotility agents and antibiotics increase the incidence of HUS 
among  children,  but  azithromycin  may  decrease  the  duration  of 
bacterial shedding in adults.

 ■ HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL 
TRANSPLANTATION–ASSOCIATED  
THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)–associated TMA devel-
ops after allogeneic HSCT, with an incidence of ~8%. Etiologic factors 
include  conditioning  regimens,  immunosuppression,  infections,  and 
graft-versus-host  disease.  Other  risk  factors  include  female  sex  and 
human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)–mismatched  donor  grafts.  HSCT-
TMA  usually  occurs  within  the  first  100  days  of  HSCT.  Table  317-1

insufficiency  are  common  after  HSCT.  HSCT-TMA  carries  a  high 
mortality  rate  (75%  within  3  months).  The  majority  of  patients  have 
>10% ADAMTS13 activity, and plasma exchange is beneficial in <25% 
of patients. Discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors and treatment of 
infections or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (if present) are recom-
mended. There are increasing reports of successful use of eculizumab, 
but clinical trial data are lacking.

 ■ HIV-RELATED THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY
HIV-related TMA is a complication encountered mainly before wide-
spread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. It is seen in patients 
with  advanced  AIDS  and  low  CD4+  T-cell  counts,  although  it  can 
be the first manifestation of HIV infection. The presence of MAHA, 
thrombocytopenia,  and  renal  failure  are  suggestive,  but  renal  biopsy 
is required for diagnosis since other renal diseases are also associated 
with  HIV  infection.  Thrombocytopenia  may  prohibit  renal  biopsy 
in some patients. The mechanism of injury is unclear, although HIV 
can  induce  apoptosis  in  endothelial  cells.  ADAMTS13  activity  is  not 
reduced  in  these  patients.  Cytomegalovirus  co-infection  may  also  be 
a risk factor. Effective antiviral therapy is key, while plasma exchange 
should be limited to patients who have evidence of TTP.

 ■ RADIATION NEPHROPATHY
Either  local  or  total-body  irradiation  can  produce  microangiopathic 
injury. The kidney is one of the most radiosensitive organs, and injury 
can result with as little as 4–5 Gy. Such injury is characterized by renal 
insufficiency,  proteinuria,  and  hypertension  usually  developing  ≥6 
months  after  radiation  exposure.  Renal  biopsy  reveals  classic  TMA 
with  damage  to  glomerular,  tubular,  and  vascular  cells,  but  systemic 
evidence  of  MAHA  is  uncommon.  Because  of  its  high  incidence 
after  allogeneic  HSCT,  radiation  nephropathy  is  often  referred  to  as 
bone marrow transplant nephropathy. No specific therapy is available, 
although  observational  evidence  supports  renin-angiotensin  system 
blockade.

 ■ SCLERODERMA (PROGRESSIVE SYSTEMIC 
SCLEROSIS)
Kidney  involvement  is  common  (up  to  52%)  in  patients  with  wide-
spread scleroderma, with 20% of cases resulting directly from sclero-
derma renal crisis. Other renal manifestations in scleroderma include 
transient (prerenal) or medication-related forms of acute kidney injury 
(e.g., associated with D-penicillamine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs,  or  cyclosporine).  Scleroderma  renal  crisis  occurs  in  12%  of 
patients  with  diffuse  systemic  sclerosis  but  in  only  2%  of  those  with 
limited systemic sclerosis. Scleroderma renal crisis is the most severe 
manifestation of renal involvement and is characterized by accelerated 
hypertension, a rapid decline in renal function, nephrotic-range pro-
teinuria, and hematuria. Retinopathy and encephalopathy may accom-
pany  the  hypertension.  Salt  and  water  retention  with  microvascular 
injury can lead to pulmonary edema. Cardiac manifestations, including 
myocarditis,  pericarditis,  and  arrhythmias,  denote  an  especially  poor 

prognosis. Although MAHA is present in more than half of patients, 
coagulopathy is rare.

The renal lesion in scleroderma renal crisis is characterized by arcu-
ate  artery  intimal  and  medial  proliferation  with  luminal  narrowing. 
This lesion is described as “onion-skinning” and can be accompanied 
by glomerular collapse due to reduced blood flow. Histologically, scle-
roderma renal crisis is indistinguishable from malignant hypertension, 
with which it can coexist. Fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis are com-
mon. Before the availability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, the mortality rate for scleroderma renal crisis was >90% at  
1 month. Introduction of renin-angiotensin system blockade has lowered 
the mortality rate to 30% at 3 years. Nearly two-thirds of patients with 
scleroderma renal crisis may require dialysis support, with recovery of 
renal  function  in  50%  (median  time,  1  year).  Glomerulonephritis  and 
vasculitis  associated  with  antineutrophil  cytoplasmic  antibodies  and 
systemic  lupus  erythematosus  have  been  described  in  patients  with 
scleroderma. An association has been found with a speckled pattern of 
antinuclear antibodies and with antibodies to RNA polymerases I and III. 
Anti-U3-RNP may identify young patients at risk for scleroderma renal 
crisis. Anticentromere antibody, in contrast, is a negative predictor of 
this disorder. Because of the overlap between scleroderma renal crisis 
and other autoimmune disorders, a renal biopsy is recommended for 
patients with atypical renal involvement, especially if hypertension is 
absent.

Treatment  with  ACE  inhibition  is  the  first-line  therapy  unless 
contraindicated. The goal of therapy is to reduce systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure by 20 mmHg and 10 mmHg, respectively, every 24 h 
until  blood  pressure  is  normal.  Additional  antihypertensive  therapy 
may be given once the dose of drug for ACE inhibition is maximized. 
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are less effective at preventing renal 
failure; thus, they are only recommended if the patient is intolerant of 
ACE  inhibitors.  ACE  inhibition  alone  does  not  prevent  scleroderma 
renal crisis, but it does reduce the impact of hypertension. In addition, 
it  has  been  observed  that  patients  on  ACE  inhibitors  have  a  higher 
renal recovery rate after initiation of dialysis, and thus, ACE inhibitors 
are continued even after starting dialysis. Intravenous iloprost has been 
used  in  Europe  for  blood  pressure  management  and  improvement 
of  renal  perfusion.  Kidney  transplantation  is  not  recommended  for 
2  years  after  the  start  of  dialysis  since  delayed  recovery  may  occur. 
Bosentan  (endothelin-1  antagonist)  and  eculizumab  have  both  been 
investigated for use in this disease.

 ■ ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME
Antiphospholipid  syndrome  (Chap.  357)  can  be  either  primary  or 
secondary  to  systemic  lupus  erythematosus.  It  is  characterized  by  a 
predisposition to systemic thrombosis (arterial and venous) and fetal 
morbidity mediated by antiphospholipid antibodies—mainly anticard-
iolipin antibodies (IgG, IgM, or IgA), lupus anticoagulant, or anti-β-2 
glycoprotein  I  antibodies  (antiβ2GPI).  Patients  with  both  anticard-
iolipin  antibodies  and  antiβ2GPI  appear  to  have  the  highest  risk  of 
thrombosis. The vascular compartment within the kidney is the main 
site of renal involvement. Arteriosclerosis is commonly present in the 
arcuate  and  intralobular  arteries.  In  the  intralobular  arteries,  fibrous 
intimal hyperplasia characterized by intimal thickening secondary to 
intense  myofibroblastic  intimal  cellular  proliferation  with  extracellu-
lar  matrix  deposition  is  frequently  seen  along  with  onion-skinning. 
Arterial and arteriolar fibrous and fibrocellular occlusions are present 
in more than two-thirds of biopsy samples. Cortical necrosis and focal 
cortical  atrophy  may  result  from  vascular  occlusion.  TMA  is  com-
monly present in renal biopsies, although signs of MAHA and platelet 
consumption are usually absent. TMA is especially common in the cat-
astrophic variant of antiphospholipid syndrome, a condition recently 
found to be pathophysiologically linked to uncontrolled complement 
activation.  In  patients  with  secondary  antiphospholipid  syndrome, 
other glomerulopathies may be present, including membranous neph-
ropathy, minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 
and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis.

Large  vessels  can  be  involved  in  antiphospholipid  syndrome  and 
may form the proximal nidus near the ostium for thrombosis of the

renal artery. Renal vein thrombosis can occur and should be suspected 
in  patients  with  lupus  anticoagulant  who  develop  nephrotic-range 
proteinuria.  Progression  to  end-stage  renal  disease  can  occur,  and 
thrombosis may form in the vascular access and the renal allografts. 
Hypertension is common. Treatment entails lifelong anticoagulation; 
however, neither safety nor effectiveness of novel oral anticoagulants 
has been established. Glucocorticoids may be beneficial in accelerated 
hypertension.  Immunosuppression  and  plasma  exchange  may  be 
helpful  for  catastrophic  episodes  of  antiphospholipid  syndrome  but 
by  themselves  do  not  reduce  recurrent  thrombosis.  More  recently, 
the  efficacy  of  rituximab  has  been  reported  in  several  cases.  A  pilot 
phase 1/2 study has shown rituximab to be safe in these patients. Sim-
ilarly, eculizumab had been shown to be efficacious in reversing the 
acute kidney injury in a number of cases, including in patients with 
catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. Some of these patients were 
refractory to rituximab. Further studies are needed for both of these 
medications.

 ■ HELLP SYNDROME
HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome is 
a dangerous complication of pregnancy associated with microvascular 
injury.  Occurring  in  0.2–0.9%  of  all  pregnancies  and  in  10–20%  of 
women  with  severe  preeclampsia,  this  syndrome  carries  a  mortality 
rate of 7.4–34%. Most commonly developing in the third trimester, 10% 
of cases occur before week 27, and 30% occur postpartum. Although a 
strong association exists between HELLP syndrome and preeclampsia, 
nearly 20% of cases are not preceded by recognized preeclampsia. Risk 
factors  include  abnormal  placentation,  family  history,  and  elevated 
levels  of  fetal  mRNA  for  FLT1  (vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
receptor 1) and endoglin. Patients with HELLP syndrome have higher 
levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, IL-1Ra, and IL-6) 
and soluble HLA-DR than do those with preeclampsia alone.

Renal  failure  occurs  in  half  of  patients  with  HELLP  syndrome, 
although  the  etiology  is  not  well  understood.  Limited  data  suggest 
that renal failure is the result of both preeclampsia and acute tubular 
necrosis.  Renal  histologic  findings  are  those  of  TMA  with  endothe-
lial  cell  swelling  and  occlusion  of  the  capillary  lumens,  but  luminal 
thrombi are typically absent. However, thrombi become more common 
in  severe  eclampsia  and  HELLP  syndrome.  Although  renal  failure  is 
common, the organ that defines this syndrome is the liver. Subcapsular 
hepatic  hematomas  sometimes  produce  spontaneous  rupture  of  the 
liver  and  can  be  life-threatening.  Neurologic  complications  such  as 
cerebral infarction, cerebral and brainstem hemorrhage, and cerebral 
edema  are  other  potentially  life-threatening  complications.  Nonfatal 
complications  include  placental  abruption,  permanent  vision  loss 
due to Purtscher-like (hemorrhagic and vaso-occlusive vasculopathy) 
retinopathy, pulmonary edema, bleeding, and fetal demise.

Many features are shared by HELLP syndrome and MAHA. Diag-
nosis of HELLP syndrome is complicated by the fact that aHUS and 
TTP  also  can  be  triggered  by  pregnancy;  in  addition,  complement 
gene  mutations  and  complement  pathway  dysfunction  are  common  
(30–40%) among patients with HELLP syndrome. Patients with anti-
phospholipid syndrome also have an elevated risk of HELLP syndrome. 
A  history  of  MAHA  before  pregnancy  is  of  diagnostic  value.  Serum 
levels of ADAMTS13 activity are reduced (by 30–60%) in HELLP syn-
drome but not to the levels seen in TTP (<10%). Determination of the 
ratio  of  lactate  dehydrogenase  to  aspartate  aminotransferase  may  be 
helpful. This ratio is 13:1 in patients with HELLP syndrome and preec-
lampsia  as  opposed  to  29:1  in  patients  without  preeclampsia.  Other 
markers, such as antithrombin III (decreased in HELLP syndrome but 
not  in  TTP)  and  D-dimer  (elevated  in  HELLP  syndrome  but  not  in 
TTP), may also be useful. HELLP syndrome usually resolves spontane-
ously after delivery, although a small percentage of HELLP cases occur 
postpartum.  Glucocorticoids  may  decrease  inflammatory  markers, 
although two randomized controlled trials failed to show much bene-
fit. Plasma exchange should be considered if hemolysis is refractory to 
glucocorticoids and/or delivery, especially if TTP has not been ruled 
out. Eculizumab has been reported to be effective in a small number 
of cases, but dosing, efficacy, and indications remain undetermined.

Myeloproliferative  Neoplasm–Related  Glomerulopathy  
While MAHA is often present in TMA, this is not true for all lesions. 
Two conditions are now recognized to present with renal TMA but 
no  evidence  of  systemic  MAHA.  The  first  is  MPN-related  glomer-
ulopathy.  MPN  represents  a  group  of  clonal  disorders  that  includes 
chronic  myelogenous  leukemia  (CML),  polycythemia  vera  (PV), 
essential  thrombocythemia  (ET),  primary  myelofibrosis  (PMF), 
chronic  eosinophilic  leukemia  not  otherwise  specified,  chronic 
neutrophilic  leukemia,  and  unclassifiable  MPN.  These  patients 
present  with  renal  impairment  and  nephrotic-range  proteinuria. 
MPN-related glomerulopathy usually occurs late in the course of the 
hematologic  condition,  as  median  time  from  diagnosis  of  MPN  to 
glomerulopathy  is  7.2  years.  Renal  biopsy  shows  mesangial  expan-
sion,  hypercellularity,  mesangial  and  segmental  sclerosis,  luminal 
hyalinosis, loss of overlying podocytes, and adhesions to Bowman’s 
capsule  and  duplication  of  glomerular  basement  membranes.  Foot 
process effacement ranges from 30 to 95%. Arteriosclerosis is com-
mon and ranges from mild to severe. Arteriolar hyalinosis can also 
be  seen.  Extramedullary  hematopoiesis  can  sometimes  be  seen, 
especially in patients with myelofibrosis. MPN-related glomerulop-
athy may develop while patients are on treatment with hydroxyurea 
and  JAK2  inhibitors.  No  standard  treatment  is  available.  Renin- 
angiotensin  system  blockade  and  corticosteroids  have  been  tried 
with mixed results.

POEMS Syndrome  POEMS syndrome is a systemic disease char-
acterized  by  polyneuropathy,  organomegaly,  endocrinopathy,  mono-
clonal  gammopathy,  and  skin  changes.  Peripheral  neuropathy  with 
severe  motor-sensory  deficit  is  the  hallmark  of  the  disease.  Patients 
also  commonly  have  elevated  IL-6  and  vascular  endothelial  growth 
factor (VEGF) levels at diagnosis. Another characteristic is that >95% 
of monoclonal light chain is of the lambda isotype. IgA also makes up 
~50% of the monoclonal proteins involved. Organomegaly can involve 
any organ and often presents as lymphadenopathy. In the kidney, the 
hypertrophy frequently is unilateral. One study suggests the difference 
in kidney size is due to unilateral contraction; however, a volumetric 
study  showed  that  enlargement  is  responsible  for  the  difference  in 
kidney  size  in  some  patients.  Glomerulomegaly  is  not  uncommon. 
Lobular appearance, endothelial cell swelling, hypercellularity, mesan-
giolysis, microaneurysm, and glomerular enlargement are reminiscent 
of  membranoproliferative  glomerulonephritis.  Most  patients  present 
with  mild  to  moderate  renal  impairment  and  low-grade  proteinuria. 
Progression to end-stage renal disease is rare.

 ■ SICKLE CELL NEPHROPATHY
Renal complications in sickle cell disease result from occlusion of the 
vasa  recta  in  the  renal  medulla.  The  low  partial  pressure  of  oxygen 
and high osmolarity predispose to hemoglobin S polymerization and 
erythrocyte sickling. Sequelae include hyposthenuria, hematuria, and 
papillary  necrosis  (which  can  also  occur  in  sickle  trait).  The  kidney 
responds  by  increasing  blood  flow  and  glomerular  filtration  rate 
mediated by prostaglandins. This dependence on prostaglandins may 
explain  the  greater  reduction  of  glomerular  filtration  rate  by  nonste-
roidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  in  these  patients  than  in  others.  The 
glomeruli  are  typically  enlarged.  Intracapillary  fragmentation  and 
phagocytosis  of  sickled  erythrocytes  are  thought  to  be  responsible 
for  the  membranoproliferative  glomerulonephritis–like  lesion,  and 
focal  segmental  glomerulosclerosis  is  seen  in  more  advanced  cases. 
Proteinuria  is  present  in  20–30%,  and  nephrotic-range  proteinuria  is 
associated  with  progression  to  renal  failure.  ACE  inhibitors  reduce 
proteinuria,  although  data  are  lacking  on  prevention  of  renal  failure. 
Patients with sickle cell disease are also more prone to acute renal fail-
ure. The cause is thought to reflect microvascular occlusion associated 
with nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis, high fever, infection, and general-
ized sickling. Chronic kidney disease is present in 12–20% of patients. 
Despite the frequency of renal disease, hypertension is uncommon in 
patients with sickle cell disease. CRISPR gene editing therapy was used 
for the first time in a patient with sickle cell anemia in 2019; long-term 
results of this novel therapy are pending.

2368 RENAL VEIN THROMBOSIS

Renal vein thrombosis either can present with flank pain, tenderness, 
hematuria,  rapid  decline  in  renal  function,  and  proteinuria  or  can 
be  silent.  Occasionally,  renal  vein  thrombosis  is  identified  during  a 
workup  for  pulmonary  embolism.  The  left  renal  vein  is  more  com-
monly involved, and two-thirds of cases are bilateral. Etiologies can be 
divided into three broad categories: endothelial damage, venous stasis, 
and  hypercoagulability.  Homocystinuria,  endovascular  intervention, 
and  surgery  can  produce  vascular  endothelial  damage.  Dehydration, 
which is more common among male patients, is a common cause of 
stasis in the pediatric population. Stasis also can result from compres-
sion  and  kinking  of  the  renal  veins  from  retroperitoneal  processes 
such as retroperitoneal fibrosis and abdominal neoplasms. Thrombosis 
can occur throughout the renal circulation, including the renal veins, 
with  antiphospholipid  syndrome.  Renal  vein  thrombosis  can  also  be 
secondary to nephrotic syndrome, particularly membranous nephrop-
athy. Other hypercoagulable states less commonly associated with renal 
vein  thrombosis  include  proteins  C  and  S,  antithrombin  deficiency, 
factor  V  Leiden,  disseminated  malignancy,  and  oral  contraceptives. 
Severe nephrotic syndrome may also predispose patients to renal vein 
thrombosis.

Diagnostic  screening  can  be  performed  with  Doppler  ultrasonog-
raphy, which is more sensitive than ultrasonography alone. Computed 
tomography  angiography  is  ~100%  sensitive.  Magnetic  resonance 
angiography  is  another  option  but  is  more  expensive.  Treatment  for 
renal  vein  thrombosis  consists  of  anticoagulation  and  therapy  for 
the  underlying  cause.  Endovascular  thrombolysis  may  be  considered 
in  severe  cases.  Occasionally,  nephrectomy  may  be  undertaken  for 
life-threatening complications. Vena caval filters are often used to pre-
vent migration of thrombi.

318 Nephrolithiasis

Gary C. Curhan

Nephrolithiasis, or kidney stone disease, is a common, painful, and costly 
condition.  Each  year,  billions  of  dollars  are  spent  on  nephrolithiasis- 
related  activity,  with  the  majority  of  expenditures  on  surgical  treat-
ment of existing stones. While a stone may form due to crystallization 
of  lithogenic  factors  in  the  upper  urinary  tract,  it  can  subsequently 
move  into  the  ureter  and  cause  renal  colic.  Although  nephrolithiasis 
is  rarely  fatal,  patients  who  have  had  renal  colic  report  that  it  is  the 
worst pain they have ever experienced. The evidence on which to base 
clinical recommendations is not as strong as desired; nonetheless, most 
experts  agree  that  the  recurrence  of  most,  if  not  all,  types  of  stones 
can  be  prevented  with  careful  evaluation  and  targeted  recommenda-
tions.  Preventive  treatment  may  be  lifelong;  therefore,  an  in-depth 
understanding  of  this  condition  must  inform  the  implementation  of 

tailored interventions that are most appropriate for and acceptable to 
the patient.

There are several types of kidney stones. It is clinically important 
to identify the stone type, which informs prognosis and selection of 
the  optimal  preventive  regimen.  Calcium  oxalate  stones  are  most 
common (~75%); next, in order, are calcium phosphate (~15%), uric 
acid  (~8%),  struvite  (~1%),  and  cystine  (<1%)  stones.  Many  stones 
are  a  mixture  of  crystal  types  (e.g.,  calcium  oxalate  and  calcium 
phosphate)  and  also  contain  protein  in  the  stone  matrix.  Rarely, 
stones  are  composed  of  medications,  such  as  acyclovir,  atazanavir, 
and triamterene. Stones that form as a result of an upper tract infec-
tion, if not appropriately treated, can have devastating consequences 
and  lead  to  end-stage  renal  disease.  Consideration  should  be  given 
to teaching practitioners strategies to prevent recurrence of all stone 
types and the related morbidity.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Nephrolithiasis  is  a  global  disease.  Data  suggest  an  increasing  prev-
alence,  likely  due  to  Westernization  of  lifestyle  habits  (e.g.,  dietary 
changes, increasing body mass index). National Health and Nutrition 
Examination  Survey  data  for  2007–2010  indicate  that  up  to  19%  of 
men  and  9%  of  women  will  develop  at  least  one  stone  during  their 
lifetime. The prevalence is ~50% lower among black individuals than 
among whites. The incidence of nephrolithiasis (i.e., the rate at which 
previously unaffected individuals develop their first stone) also varies 
by  age,  sex,  and  race.  Among  white  men,  the  peak  annual  incidence 
is ~3.5 cases/1000 at age 40 and declines to ~2 cases/1000 by age 70. 
Among  white  women  in  their  thirties,  the  annual  incidence  is  ~2.5 
cases/1000;  the  figure  decreases  to  ~1.5/1000  at  age  50  and  beyond. 
In  addition  to  the  medical  costs  associated  with  nephrolithiasis,  this 
condition also has a substantial economic impact, as those affected are 
often of working age. Once an individual has had a stone, the preven-
tion of a recurrence is essential. Published recurrence rates vary by the 
definitions and diagnostic methods used. Some reports have relied on 
symptomatic events, while others have been based on imaging. Most 
experts  agree  that  radiographic  evidence  of  a  second  stone  should 
be considered to represent a recurrence, even if the stone has not yet 
caused symptoms.

 ■ ASSOCIATED MEDICAL CONDITIONS
Nephrolithiasis  is  a  systemic  disorder.  Several  conditions  predispose 
to  stone  formation,  including  gastrointestinal  malabsorption  (e.g., 
Crohn’s disease, gastric bypass surgery), primary hyperparathyroidism, 
obesity,  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  and  distal  renal  tubular  acidosis.  A 
number of other medical conditions are more likely to be present in 
individuals  with  a  history  of  nephrolithiasis,  including  hypertension, 
gout, cardiovascular disease, cholelithiasis, reduced bone mineral den-
sity, and chronic kidney disease.

Although  nephrolithiasis  does  not  directly  cause  upper  urinary 
tract  infections  (UTIs),  a  UTI  in  the  setting  of  an  obstructing  stone 
is  a  urologic  emergency  (“pus  under  pressure”)  and  requires  urgent 
intervention to reestablish drainage.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS
In the consideration of the processes involved in crystal formation, it 
is helpful to view urine as a complex solution. A clinically useful con-
cept is supersaturation (the point at which the concentration product 
exceeds  the  solubility  product).  However,  even  though  the  urine  in 
most individuals is supersaturated with respect to one or more types 
of  crystals,  the  presence  of  inhibitors  of  crystallization  prevents  the 
majority  of  the  population  from  continuously  forming  stones.  The 
most  clinically  important  inhibitor  of  calcium-containing  stones  is 
urine citrate. While the calculated supersaturation value does not per-
fectly predict stone formation, it is a useful guide as it integrates the 
multiple factors that are measured in a 24-h urine collection.

Recent studies have changed the paradigm for the site of initiation 
of  stone  formation.  Renal  biopsies  of  stone  formers  have  revealed 
calcium  phosphate  in  the  renal  interstitium.  It  is  hypothesized  that 
this calcium phosphate deposits at the thin limb of the loop of Henle 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2368

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractand then extends down to the papilla and erodes through the papillary 
epithelium, where it provides a site for deposition of calcium oxalate 
and calcium phosphate crystals. The majority of calcium oxalate stones 
grow  on  calcium  phosphate  at  the  tip  of  the  renal  papilla  (Randall’s 
plaque).  Tubular  plugs  of  calcium  phosphate  may  be  the  initiating 
event  in  calcium  phosphate  stone  development.  Thus,  the  process  of 
stone formation may begin years before a clinically detectable stone is 
identified. The processes involved in interstitial deposition are under 
active investigation.

 ■ RISK FACTORS
Risk  factors  for  nephrolithiasis  can  be  categorized  as  dietary,  nondi-
etary,  or  urinary.  These  risk  factors  vary  by  stone  type  and  clinical 
characteristics.

Dietary  Risk  Factors  Patients  who  develop  stones  often  change 
their  diet;  therefore,  studies  that  retrospectively  assess  diet  may  be 
hampered  by  recall  bias.  Some  studies  have  examined  the  relation 
between diet and changes in the lithogenic composition of the urine, 
often  using  calculated  supersaturation.  However,  the  composition  of 
the urine does not perfectly predict risk, and not all components that 
modify  risk  are  included  in  the  calculation  of  supersaturation.  Thus, 
dietary  associations  are  best  investigated  by  prospective  studies  that 
examine actual stone formation as the outcome. Dietary factors that are 
associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis include animal pro-
tein, oxalate, sodium, sucrose, and fructose. Dietary factors associated 
with a lower risk include calcium, potassium, and phytate.
CALCIUM  The  role  of  dietary  calcium  deserves  special  attention. 
Although  in  the  distant  past  dietary  calcium  had  been  suspected  of 
increasing the risk of stone disease, several prospective observational 
studies  and  a  randomized  controlled  trial  have  demonstrated  that 
higher dietary calcium intake is related to a lower risk of stone forma-
tion. The reduction in risk associated with higher calcium intake may 
be  due  to  a  reduction  in  intestinal  absorption  of  dietary  oxalate  that 
results  in  lower  urine  oxalate.  Low  calcium  intake  is  contraindicated 
as it increases the risk of stone formation and may contribute to lower 
bone density in stone formers.

Despite similar bioavailability, supplemental calcium may increase 
the  risk  of  stone  formation.  The  discrepancy  between  the  risks  from 
dietary calcium and calcium supplements may be due to the timing of 
supplemental calcium intake or to higher total calcium consumption 
leading to higher urinary calcium excretion.
OXALATE  Urinary  oxalate  is  derived  from  both  endogenous  pro-
duction and absorption of dietary oxalate. Owing to its low and often 
variable bioavailability, much of the oxalate in food may not be read-
ily  absorbed.  However,  absorption  may  be  higher  in  stone  formers. 
Although observational studies demonstrate that dietary oxalate is only 
a weak risk factor for stone formation, urinary oxalate is a strong risk 
factor  for  calcium  oxalate  stone  formation,  and  efforts  to  avoid  high 
oxalate intake should thus be beneficial.
OTHER  NUTRIENTS  Several  other  nutrients  have  been  studied  and 
implicated  in  stone  formation.  Higher  intake  of  animal  protein  may 
lead  to  increased  excretion  of  calcium  and  uric  acid  as  well  as  to 
decreased urinary excretion of citrate, all of which increase the risk of 
stone formation. Higher sodium and sucrose intake increases calcium 
excretion  independent  of  calcium  intake.  Higher  potassium  intake 
decreases calcium excretion, and many potassium-rich foods increase 
urinary  citrate  excretion  due  to  their  alkali  content.  Other  dietary 
factors that have been inconsistently associated with lower stone risk 
include magnesium and phytate.

Vitamin C supplements are associated with an increased risk of cal-
cium oxalate stone formation in men, possibly because of raised levels 
of oxalate in urine. Thus, male calcium oxalate stone formers should 
be  advised  to  avoid  vitamin  C  supplements.  Although  high  doses  of 
supplemental  vitamin  B6  may  be  beneficial  in  selected  patients  with 
type 1 primary hyperoxaluria, the risk is not reduced in other patients.
FLUIDS AND BEVERAGES  The risk of stone formation increases as urine 
volume  decreases.  When  the  urine  output  is  <1  L/d,  the  risk  of  stone 

formation more than doubles. Fluid intake is the main determinant of 
urine volume, and the importance of fluid intake in preventing stone for-
mation has been demonstrated in observational studies and in a random-
ized controlled trial. Observational studies have found that coffee, tea, 
beer, wine, and orange juice are associated with a reduced risk of stone 
formation. Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption may increase risk.

Nondietary Risk Factors  Age, race, body size, and environment 
are important risk factors for nephrolithiasis. The incidence of stone 
disease is highest in middle-aged white men, but stones can form in 
infants  as  well  as  in  the  elderly.  There  is  geographic  variability,  with 
the highest prevalence in the southeastern United States. Weight gain 
increases the risk of stone formation, and the increasing prevalence of 
nephrolithiasis in the United States may be due in part to the increasing 
prevalence of obesity. Environmental and occupational influences that 
may  lead  to  lower  urine  volume,  such  as  working  in  a  hot  environ-
ment  or  lack  of  ready  access  to  water  or  a  bathroom,  are  important 
considerations.

Urinary Risk Factors 
URINE  VOLUME  As  mentioned  above,  lower  urine  volume  results 
in  higher  concentrations  of  lithogenic  factors  and  is  a  common  and 
readily  modifiable  risk  factor.  A  randomized  trial  has  demonstrated 
the effectiveness of higher fluid intake in increasing urine volume and 
reducing the risk of stone recurrence.

URINE  CALCIUM  Higher  urine  calcium  excretion  increases  the  like-
lihood of formation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones. 
While the term hypercalciuria is often used, there is no widely accepted 
cutoff that distinguishes between normal and abnormal urine calcium 
excretion.  In  fact,  the  relation  between  urine  calcium  and  stone  risk 
appears to be continuous; thus, the use of an arbitrary threshold should 
be avoided. Levels of urine calcium excretion are higher in individuals 
with  a  history  of  nephrolithiasis;  however,  the  mechanisms  remain 
poorly understood. Greater gastrointestinal calcium absorption is one 
important  contributor,  and  greater  bone  turnover  (with  a  resultant 
reduction  in  bone  mineral  density)  may  be  another.  Primary  renal 
calcium  loss,  with  lower  serum  calcium  concentrations  and  elevated 
serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (and a normal 25-hydroxy 
vitamin D level), is rare.

URINE  OXALATE  Higher  urine  oxalate  excretion  increases  the  like-
lihood  of  calcium  oxalate  stone  formation.  As  for  urine  calcium,  no 
definition  for  “abnormal”  urine  oxalate  excretion  is  widely  accepted. 
Given that the relation between urine oxalate and stone risk is continu-
ous, simple dichotomization of urine oxalate excretion is not helpful in 
assessing risk. The two sources of urine oxalate are endogenous gener-
ation and dietary intake. Dietary oxalate is the major contributor and 
also the source that can be modified. Notably, higher dietary calcium 
intake reduces gastrointestinal oxalate absorption and thereby reduces 
urine oxalate.

URINE  CITRATE  Urine  citrate  is  a  natural  inhibitor  of  calcium- 
containing stones; thus, lower urine citrate excretion increases the risk 
of stone formation. Citrate reabsorption is influenced by the intracel-
lular pH of proximal tubular cells. Metabolic acidosis, including that 
due  to  higher  animal  flesh  intake,  will  lead  to  a  reduction  in  citrate 
excretion  by  increasing  reabsorption  of  filtered  citrate.  However,  a 
notable proportion of patients have lower urine citrate for reasons that 
remain unclear.

URINE URIC ACID  Higher urine levels of uric acid—a risk factor for 
uric acid stone formation—are found in individuals with excess purine 
consumption and rare genetic conditions that lead to overproduction 
of uric acid. This characteristic does not appear to be associated with 
the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.
URINE  pH  Urine  pH  influences  the  solubility  of  some  crystal  types. 
Uric  acid  stones  form  only  when  the  urine  pH  is  consistently  ≤5.5, 
whereas  calcium  phosphate  stones  are  more  likely  to  form  when  the 
urine pH is ≥6.5. Cystine is more soluble at higher urine pH. Calcium 
oxalate stones are not influenced by urine pH.

Genetic  Risk  Factors  The  risk  of  nephrolithiasis  is  more 
than twofold greater in individuals with a family history of stone 
disease. This association is likely due to a combination of genetic 
predisposition and similar environmental exposures. While a number 
of rare monogenic disorders cause nephrolithiasis, the genetic contrib-
utors to common forms of stone disease remain to be determined.

The  two  most  common  and  well-characterized  rare  monogenic 
disorders that lead to stone formation are primary hyperoxaluria and 
cystinuria.  Primary  hyperoxaluria  is  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder 
that causes excessive endogenous oxalate generation by the liver, with 
consequent calcium oxalate stone formation and crystal deposition in 
organs. Intraparenchymal calcium oxalate deposition in the kidney can 
eventually lead to renal failure. Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive dis-
order that causes abnormal reabsorption of filtered basic amino acids. 
The  excessive  urinary  excretion  of  cystine,  which  is  poorly  soluble, 
leads  to  cystine  stone  formation.  Cystine  stones  are  visible  on  plain 
radiographs and often manifest as staghorn calculi or multiple bilateral 
stones. Repeat episodes of obstruction and instrumentation can cause 
a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Nephrolithiasis

Evidence-based  guidelines  for  the  evaluation  and  treatment  of 
nephrolithiasis have been published. Although there is limited evi-
dence for several aspects, there are standard approaches to patients 
with acute and chronic presentations that can reasonably guide the 
clinical evaluation.

It  typically  requires  weeks  to  months  (and  often  much  longer) 
for a kidney stone to grow to a clinically detectable size. Although 
the  passage  of  a  stone  is  a  dramatic  event,  stone  formation  and 
growth  are  characteristically  clinically  silent.  A  stone  can  remain 
asymptomatic in the kidney for years or even decades before signs 
(e.g., hematuria) or symptoms (e.g., pain) become apparent. Thus, 
it is important to remember that the onset of symptoms, typically 
attributable  to  a  stone  moving  into  the  ureter,  does  not  provide 
insight into when the stone actually formed. The factors that induce 
stone movement are unknown. 
CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
There are two common presentations for individuals with an acute 
stone  event:  renal  colic  and  painless  gross  hematuria.  Renal  colic 
is  a  misnomer  because  pain  typically  does  not  subside  completely; 
rather, it varies in intensity. When a stone moves into the ureter, the 
discomfort often begins with a sudden onset of unilateral flank pain.

The intensity of the pain can increase rapidly, and there are no 
alleviating factors. This pain, which is accompanied often by nau-
sea  and  occasionally  by  vomiting,  may  radiate,  depending  on  the 
location  of  the  stone.  If  the  stone  lodges  in  the  upper  part  of  the 
ureter, pain may radiate anteriorly; if the stone is in the lower part 
of  the  ureter,  pain  can  radiate  to  the  ipsilateral  testicle  in  men  or 
the ipsilateral labium in women. Occasionally, a patient has gross 
hematuria without pain.

Other  diagnoses  may  be  confused  with  acute  renal  colic.  If  the 
stone is lodged at the right ureteropelvic junction, symptoms may 
mimic those of acute cholecystitis. If the stone blocks the ureter as 
it  crosses  over  the  right  pelvic  brim,  symptoms  may  mimic  acute 
appendicitis, whereas blockage at the left pelvic brim may be con-
fused with acute diverticulitis. If the stone lodges in the ureter at the 
ureterovesical junction, the patient may experience urinary urgency 
and frequency. In female patients, the latter symptoms may lead to 
an  incorrect  diagnosis  of  bacterial  cystitis;  the  urine  will  contain 
red and white blood cells, but the urine culture will be negative. An 
obstructing stone with proximal infection may present as acute pye-
lonephritis. A UTI in the setting of ureteral obstruction is a medical 
emergency that requires immediate restoration of drainage by place-
ment of either a ureteral stent or a percutaneous nephrostomy tube. 
Other  conditions  to  consider  in  the  differential  diagnosis  include 
muscular or skeletal pain, herpes zoster, duodenal ulcer, abdominal 
aortic  aneurysm,  gynecologic  conditions,  ureteral  stricture,  and 
ureteral obstruction by materials other than a stone, such as a blood 
clot or sloughed papilla. Extraluminal processes can lead to ureteral 
compression and obstruction; however, because of the gradual onset, 
these conditions do not typically present with renal colic. 

DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTION
Serum chemistry findings are typically normal, but the white blood 
cell count may be elevated. Examination of the urine sediment will 
usually  reveal  red  and  white  blood  cells  and  occasionally  crystals 
(Fig. 318-1). The absence of hematuria does not exclude a stone, 
particularly when urine flow is completely obstructed by a stone.

The diagnosis is often made on the basis of the history, physical 
examination, and urinalysis. Thus, it may not be necessary to wait 
for  radiographic  confirmation  before  treating  the  symptoms.  The 
diagnosis  is  confirmed  by  an  appropriate  imaging  study—preferably 
helical  computed  tomography  (CT),  which  is  highly  sensitive, 
allows  visualization  of  uric  acid  stones  (traditionally  considered 
“radiolucent”),  and  does  not  require  radiocontrast  (Fig.  318-2). 
Helical CT detects stones as small as 1 mm that may be missed by 
other imaging modalities.

EVALUATION FOR STONE PREVENTION
More  than  half  of  first-time  stone  formers  will  have  a  recurrence 
within  10  years.  A  careful  evaluation  is  indicated  to  identify  pre-
disposing factors, which can then be modified to reduce the risk of 
new stone formation. It is appropriate to proceed with an evaluation 
even after the first stone if the patient is interested because recur-
rences  are  common  and  are  usually  preventable  with  inexpensive 
lifestyle modifications or other treatments. 

HISTORY
A detailed history, obtained from the patient and from a thorough 
review  of  medical  records,  should  include  the  number  and  fre-
quency  of  episodes  (distinguishing  stone  passage  from  stone  for-
mation)  and  previous  imaging  studies,  interventions,  evaluations, 
and treatments. Inquiries about the patient’s medical history should 
cover UTIs, gastric bypass surgery and other malabsorptive condi-
tions, gout, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. A family history of 
stone disease may reveal a genetic predisposition. A complete list 
of current prescription and over-the-counter medications as well as 
vitamin and mineral supplements is essential. The review of systems 
should  focus  on  identifying  possible  etiologic  factors  related  to 
low urine volume (e.g., high insensible losses) and gastrointestinal 
malabsorption as well as on ascertaining how frequently the patient 
voids during the day and overnight.

A  large  body  of  compelling  evidence  has  demonstrated  the 
important  role  of  diet  in  stone  disease.  Thus,  the  dietary  history 
should encompass information on usual dietary habits (meals and 
snacks), calcium intake, consumption of high-oxalate foods (spin-
ach, rhubarb, potatoes), and fluid intake (including amount of spe-
cific beverages typically consumed). Amount and frequency of use 
of vitamin and mineral supplements should be carefully assessed. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The  physical  examination  should  assess  weight,  blood  pressure, 
costovertebral angle tenderness, and lower-extremity edema as well 
as  signs  of  other  systemic  conditions  such  as  primary  hyperpara-
thyroidism and gout. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION
If  not  recently  measured,  the  following  serum  levels  should  be 
determined: electrolytes (to uncover hypokalemia or renal tubular 
acidosis), creatinine, calcium, and uric acid. The PTH level should 
be  measured  if  indicated  by  high-normal  or  elevated  serum  and 
urine  calcium  concentrations.  25-Hydroxy  vitamin  D  should  be 
measured  in  concert  with  PTH  to  investigate  the  possible  role 
of  secondarily  elevated  PTH  levels  in  the  setting  of  vitamin  D 
insufficiency.

The urinalysis, including examination of the sediment, can pro-
vide useful information. In individuals with asymptomatic residual 
renal  stones,  red  and  white  blood  cells  are  frequently  present  in 
urine.  If  there  is  concern  about  the  possibility  of  an  infection,  a 
urine culture should be performed. The sediment may also reveal 
crystals  (Fig.  318-1),  which  may  help  identify  the  stone  type  and 
also provide prognostic information, as crystalluria is a strong risk 
factor for new stone formation.

The  results  from  24-h  urine  collections  serve  as  the  corner-
stone  on  which  therapeutic  recommendations  are  based.  Rec-
ommendations on lifestyle modification should be deferred until 
urine  collection  is  complete.  As  a  baseline  assessment,  patients 
should  collect  at  least  two  24-h  urine  samples  while  consuming 
their  usual  diet  and  usual  volume  of  fluid.  The  following  factors 
should  be  measured:  total  volume,  calcium,  oxalate,  citrate,  uric 
acid,  sodium,  potassium,  phosphorus,  pH,  and  creatinine.  When 
available, the calculated supersaturation is also informative. There 
is substantial day-to-day variability in the 24-h excretion of many 
relevant  factors;  therefore,  obtaining  values  from  two  collections 
is  important  before  committing  a  patient  to  long-term  lifestyle 
changes or medication. The interpretation of the 24-h urine results 

FIGURE 318-2  Coronal noncontrast CT image from a patient who presented with 
left-sided  renal  colic.  An  obstructing  calculus,  present  in  the  distal  left  ureter 
at  the  level  of  S1,  measures  10  mm  in  maximal  dimension.  There  is  severe  left 
hydroureteronephrosis  and  associated  left  perinephric  fat  stranding.  In  addition, 
there is a nonobstructing 6-mm left renal calculus in the interpolar region. (Image

Typically, helical CT reveals a ureteral stone or evidence of recent 
passage  (e.g.,  perinephric  stranding  or  hydronephrosis),  whereas 
a plain abdominal radiograph (kidney/ureter/bladder [KUB]) can 
miss a stone in the ureter or kidney, even if it is radiopaque, and 
does  not  provide  information  on  obstruction.  Abdominal  ultra-
sound  offers  the  advantage  of  avoiding  radiation  and  provides 
information on hydronephrosis, but it is not as sensitive as CT and 
images only the kidney and possibly the proximal segment of the 
ureter; thus, most ureteral stones are not detectable by ultrasound.
Many  patients  who  experience  their  first  episode  of  colic  seek 
emergent medical care. Randomized trials have demonstrated that 
parenterally  administered  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs 
(such as ketorolac) are just as effective as opioids in relieving symp-
toms  and  have  fewer  side  effects.  Excessive  fluid  administration 
has not been shown to be beneficial; therefore, the goal should be 
to  maintain  euvolemia.  If  the  pain  can  be  adequately  controlled 
and the patient is able to take fluids orally, hospitalization can be 
avoided. Use of an alpha blocker may increase the rate of spontane-
ous stone passage.

Urologic  intervention  should  be  postponed  unless  there  is  evi-
dence of UTI, a low probability of spontaneous stone passage (e.g., 
a stone measuring ≥6 mm or an anatomic abnormality), or intrac-
table pain. A ureteral stent may be placed cystoscopically, but this 
procedure typically requires general anesthesia, and the stent can be 
quite uncomfortable, may cause gross hematuria, and may increase 
the risk of UTI.

If an intervention is indicated, the selection of the most appro-
priate intervention is determined by the size, location, and compo-
sition of the stone; the urinary tract anatomy; and the experience 
of  the  urologist.  Extracorporeal  shockwave  lithotripsy  (ESWL), 
the  least  invasive  option,  uses  shockwaves  generated  outside  the 
body  to  fragment  the  stone,  but  is  being  used  less  frequently.  An 
endourologic  approach,  now  more  frequently  used  than  ESWL, 
can remove a stone by basket extraction or laser fragmentation. For 
large upper-tract stones, percutaneous nephrostolithotomy has the 
highest  likelihood  of  rendering  the  patient  stone-free.  Advances 
in  urologic  approaches  and  instruments  have  nearly  eliminated 
the need for open surgical procedures such as ureterolithotomy or 
pyelolithotomy.

should take into account that the collections are usually performed 
on a weekend day when the patient is staying at home; an individ-
ual’s habits may differ dramatically (beneficially or detrimentally) 
at work or outside the home. Specialized testing, such as calcium 
loading or restriction, is not recommended as it does not influence 
clinical recommendations.

Stone composition analysis is essential if a stone or fragment is 
available; patients should be encouraged to retrieve passed stones. 
The  stone  type  cannot  be  determined  with  certainty  from  24-h 
urine  results,  but  pure  uric  acid  stones  can  be  identified  by  low 
Hounsfield units on CT. 
IMAGING
The “gold standard” diagnostic test is helical CT without contrast. 
If  not  already  performed  during  an  acute  episode,  a  low-dose 
renal-limited CT should be considered to definitively establish the 
baseline stone burden. A suboptimal imaging study may not detect 
a residual stone that, if subsequently passed, would be mistaken for 
a new stone. In this instance, the preventive medical regimen might 
be unnecessarily changed as the result of a preexisting stone.

Recommendations  for  follow-up  imaging  should  be  tailored  to 
the  individual  patient.  While  CT  provides  the  best  information, 
the radiation dose is higher than from other modalities; therefore, 
CT should be performed only if the results will lead to a change in 
clinical recommendations. Although less sensitive, renal ultrasound 
is typically used to minimize radiation exposure, with recognition 
of the limitations. 
PREVENTION OF NEW STONE FORMATION
Recommendations  for  preventing  stone  formation  depend  on  the 
stone type and the results of metabolic evaluation. After remediable 
secondary  causes  of  stone  formation  (e.g.,  primary  hyperparathy-
roidism) are excluded, the focus should turn to modification of the 
urine composition to reduce the risk of new stone formation. The 
urinary constituents and calculated urine supersaturation are con-
tinuous variables, and the associated risk is continuous; thus, there 
are  no  definitive  thresholds.  Dichotomization  into  “normal”  and 
“abnormal” can be misleading and should be avoided.

For  all  stone  types,  consistently  diluted  urine  reduces  the  like-
lihood  of  crystal  formation.  The  urine  volume  should  be  at  least 
2  L/d.  Because  of  differences  in  insensible  fluid  losses  and  fluid 
intake from food sources, the required total fluid intake will vary 
from person to person. Rather than specify how much to drink, it 
is more helpful to educate patients about how much more they need 
to drink in light of their 24-h urine volume. For example, if the daily 
urine volume is 1.5 L, then the patient should be advised to drink 
at least 0.5 L more per day in order to increase the urine volume to 
the goal of 2 L/d.

 ■ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC STONE TYPES
Calcium  Oxalate  Risk  factors  for  calcium  oxalate  stones  include 
higher  urine  calcium,  higher  urine  oxalate,  and  lower  urine  citrate. 
This stone type is insensitive to pH in the physiologic range.

Individuals  with  higher  urine  calcium  excretion  tend  to  absorb  a 
higher  percentage  of  ingested  calcium.  Nevertheless,  dietary  calcium 
restriction  is  not  beneficial  and,  in  fact,  is  likely  to  be  harmful  (see 
“Dietary Risk Factors,” above). In a randomized trial in men with high 
urine calcium and recurrent calcium oxalate stones, a diet containing 
1200  mg  of  calcium  and  a  low  intake  of  sodium  and  animal  protein 
significantly  reduced  subsequent  stone  formation  compared  with  a 
low-calcium diet (400 mg/d). Excessive calcium intake (>1200 mg/d) 
should be avoided.

A thiazide diuretic, in doses higher than those used to treat hyper-
tension, can substantially lower urine calcium excretion. Several ran-
domized  controlled  trials  have  demonstrated  that  thiazide  diuretics, 
most  commonly  chlorthalidone,  can  reduce  calcium  oxalate  stone 
recurrence  by  ~50%.  When  a  thiazide  is  prescribed,  dietary  sodium 
restriction  is  essential  to  obtain  the  desired  reduction  in  urinary 

calcium excretion and minimize urinary potassium losses. While bis-
phosphonates may reduce urine calcium excretion in some individuals, 
there are only observational data to suggest whether this class of med-
ication can reduce stone formation; therefore, bisphosphonates cannot 
be recommended solely for stone prevention at present, but they can be 
used to treat those individuals with low bone density.

A reduction in urine oxalate will in turn reduce the supersaturation 
of calcium oxalate. In patients with the common form of nephrolith-
iasis,  avoiding  high-dose  vitamin  C  supplements  is  the  only  known 
strategy that reduces endogenous oxalate production.

Oxalate  is  a  metabolic  end  product;  therefore,  any  dietary  oxalate 
that  is  absorbed  will  be  excreted  in  the  urine.  Reducing  absorption 
of  exogenous  oxalate  involves  two  approaches.  First,  the  avoidance 
of  foods  that  contain  high  amounts  of  oxalate,  such  as  spinach,  rhu-
barb,  almonds,  and  potatoes,  is  prudent.  However,  extreme  oxalate 
restriction  has  not  been  demonstrated  to  reduce  stone  recurrence 
and  could  be  harmful  to  overall  health,  given  other  health  benefits 
of many foods that are erroneously considered to be high in oxalate. 
Controversy exists regarding the most clinically relevant measure of the 
oxalate content of foods (e.g., bioavailability). Second, the absorption 
of oxalate is reduced by higher calcium intake; therefore, individuals 
with higher-than-desired urinary oxalate should be counseled to con-
sume adequate calcium. Oxalate absorption can be influenced by the 
intestinal microbiota, depending on the presence of oxalate-degrading 
bacteria.  Currently,  however,  there  are  no  available  therapies  to  alter 
the  microbiota  that  beneficially  affect  urinary  oxalate  excretion  over 
the long term.

Citrate is a natural inhibitor of calcium oxalate and calcium phos-
phate  stones.  Higher-level  consumption  of  foods  rich  in  alkali  (i.e., 
fruits  and  vegetables)  can  increase  urine  citrate.  For  patients  with 
lower urine citrate in whom dietary modification does not adequately 
increase  urine  citrate,  the  addition  of  supplemental  alkali  (typically 
potassium  citrate  or  bicarbonate)  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  urinary 
citrate  excretion.  Sodium  salts,  such  as  sodium  bicarbonate,  while 
successful  in  raising  urine  citrate,  are  typically  avoided  due  to  the 
adverse effects of sodium on urine calcium excretion. Urine pH in the 
physiologic range does not influence calcium oxalate stone formation.
Past  reports  suggested  that  higher  levels  of  urine  uric  acid  may 
increase the risk of calcium oxalate stones, but more recent studies do 
not support this association. However, allopurinol reduced stone recur-
rence in one randomized controlled trial in patients with calcium oxalate 
stones and high urine uric acid levels. The lack of association between 
urine uric acid level and calcium oxalate stones suggests that a different 
mechanism underlies the observed beneficial effect of allopurinol.

Additional  dietary  modifications  may  be  beneficial  in  reducing 
stone  recurrence.  Restriction  of  nondairy  animal  protein  (e.g.,  meat, 
chicken,  seafood)  is  a  reasonable  approach  and  may  result  in  higher 
excretion of citrate and lower excretion of calcium. In addition, reduc-
ing sodium intake to <2.5 g/d may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. 
Sucrose and fructose intake should be minimized.

For  adherence  to  a  dietary  pattern  that  is  more  manageable  for 
patients  than  manipulating  individual  nutrients,  the  DASH  (Dietary 
Approaches  to  Stop  Hypertension)  diet  provides  an  appropriate  and 
readily  available  option.  Randomized  trials  have  conclusively  shown 
the  DASH  diet  to  reduce  blood  pressure.  At  present,  only  data  from 
observational studies are available, but these demonstrate a strong and 
consistent inverse association between the DASH diet and risk of stone 
formation.

Calcium Phosphate  Calcium phosphate stones share risk factors 
with calcium oxalate stones, including higher concentrations of urine 
calcium and lower concentrations of urine citrate, but additional fac-
tors deserve attention. Higher urine phosphate levels and higher urine 
pH (typically ≥6.5) are associated with an increased likelihood of cal-
cium phosphate stone formation. Calcium phosphate stones are more 
common  in  patients  with  distal  renal  tubular  acidosis  and  primary 
hyperparathyroidism.

There are no randomized trials on which to base preventive recom-
mendations for calcium phosphate stone formers, so the interventions 

HPIM21e_Part9_p2279-p2380.indd   2372

20/01/22   8:49 PM

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractare  focused  on  modification  of  the  recognized  risk  factors.  Thiazide 
diuretics  (with  sodium  restriction)  may  be  used  to  reduce  urine  cal-
cium, as described above for calcium oxalate stones. In patients with 
low  urine  citrate  levels,  alkali  supplements  (e.g.,  potassium  citrate  or 
bicarbonate) may be used to increase urine citrate. However, the urine 
pH  of  these  patients  should  be  monitored  initially  because  supple-
mental  alkali  can  raise  urine  pH,  thereby  potentially  increasing  the 
risk of stone formation. Because these patients tend to have a urinary 
acidification defect, reducing the urine pH is not an option. Reduction 
of  dietary  phosphate  may  be  beneficial  by  reducing  urine  phosphate 
excretion.
Uric Acid  The  two  main  risk  factors  for  uric  acid  stones  are  per-
sistently low urine pH and higher uric acid excretion. Urine pH is the 
predominant influence on uric acid solubility; therefore, the mainstay 
of  prevention  of  uric  acid  stone  formation  entails  increasing  urine 
pH.  Alkalinizing  the  urine  can  be  readily  achieved  by  increasing  the 
intake of foods rich in alkali (e.g., fruits and vegetables) and reducing 
the intake of foods that produce acid (e.g., animal flesh). If necessary, 
supplementation  with  bicarbonate  or  citrate  salts  (preferably  potas-
sium-based)  can  be  used  to  reach  the  recommended  pH  goal  of  6.5 
throughout the day and night.

Urine uric acid excretion is determined by uric acid generation. Uric 
acid is the end product of purine metabolism; thus, reduced consump-
tion of purine-containing foods can lower urine uric acid excretion. It 
is noteworthy that the serum uric acid level is dependent on the frac-
tional excretion of uric acid and therefore does not provide informa-
tion on urine uric acid excretion. For example, an individual with high 
uric acid generation and concurrent high fractional excretion of uric 
acid will have high urine uric acid excretion with a normal (or even 
low)  serum  uric  acid  level.  If  alkalinization  of  the  urine  alone  is  not 
successful and if dietary modifications do not reduce urine uric acid 
sufficiently, then the use of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, such as allopu-
rinol or febuxostat, can reduce urine uric acid excretion by 40–50%.
Cystine  Cystine excretion is not easily modified. Long-term dietary 
cystine restriction is not feasible and is unlikely to be successful; thus, 
the  focus  for  cystine  stone  prevention  is  on  increasing  cystine  solu-
bility.  This  goal  may  be  achieved  by  treatment  with  medication  that 
covalently binds to cystine (tiopronin or penicillamine) and a medica-
tion that raises urine pH. Tiopronin is the preferred choice due to its 
better adverse event profile. The preferred alkalinizing agent to achieve 
a urine pH of 7.5 is potassium citrate or bicarbonate as sodium salts 
may increase cystine excretion. As with all stone types, and especially 
in  patients  with  cystinuria,  maintaining  a  high  urine  volume  is  an 
essential component of the preventive regimen.
Struvite  Struvite  stones,  also  known  as  infection  stones  or  triple-
phosphate  stones,  form  only  when  the  upper  urinary  tract  is  infected 
with  urease-producing  bacteria  such  as  Proteus  mirabilis,  Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, or Providencia species. Urease produced by these bacteria 
hydrolyzes  urea  and  may  elevate  the  urine  pH  to  a  supraphysiologic 
level (>8.0). Struvite stones may grow quickly and fill the renal pelvis 
(staghorn calculi).

Struvite stones require complete removal by a urologist. New stone 
formation can be avoided by the prevention of UTIs. In patients with 
recurrent  upper  UTIs  (e.g.,  some  individuals  with  surgically  altered 
urinary drainage or spinal cord injury), the urease inhibitor acetohy-
droxamic acid can be considered; however, this agent should be used 
with caution because of potential side effects.
 ■ LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP
In  general,  the  preventive  regimens  described  above  do  not  cure  the 
underlying  pathophysiologic  process.  Thus,  these  recommendations 
typically need to be followed for the patient’s lifetime, and it is essential 
to  tailor  recommendations  in  a  way  that  is  acceptable  to  the  patient. 
Because the memory of the acute stone event fades and patients often 
return to old habits (e.g., insufficient fluid intake), long-term follow-up, 
including repeat 24-h urine collections typically annually, is important 
to ensure that the preventive regimen has been implemented and has 
resulted in the desired reduction in the risk of new stone formation.

2373

Follow-up imaging should be planned thoughtfully. Many patients 
with  recurrent  episodes  of  renal  colic  that  lead  to  emergency  room 
visits often undergo repeat CT studies. While CT does provide the best 
information, the radiation dose is substantially higher than that with 
plain abdominal radiography (KUB). Small stones may be missed by 
KUB,  and  ultrasound  has  a  limited  ability  to  determine  the  size  and 
number of stones. Minimizing radiation exposure should be a goal of 
the long-term follow-up plan and must be balanced against the gain in 
diagnostic information.

319 Urinary Tract Obstruction

Julian L. Seifter

Obstruction  to  the  flow  of  urine,  with  attendant  stasis  and  elevation 
in urinary tract pressure, impairs renal and urinary conduit functions 
and is a common cause of acute and chronic kidney disease (obstruc-
tive nephropathy). Early recognition and prompt treatment of urinary 
tract obstruction (UTO) can prevent or reverse devastating effects on 
kidney structure and function, and decrease susceptibility to hyperten-
sion, infection, and stone formation. Chronic obstruction may lead to 
permanent loss of renal mass (renal atrophy) and excretory capability. 
Because  obstructive  disease  may  be  secondary  to  serious  underlying 
inflammatory, vascular, or malignant disease, familiarity with clinical 
findings, appropriate diagnostic testing, and therapeutic approach is of 
great importance to the clinician.
 ■ ETIOLOGY
Obstruction to urine flow can result from intrinsic or extrinsic mechanical 
blockade  as  well  as  from  functional  defects  not  associated  with  fixed 
occlusion of the urinary drainage system. Mechanical obstruction can 
occur at any level of the urinary tract, from within the renal tubules, 
or the renal calyces to the external urethral meatus (obstructive urop-
athy). Normal points of narrowing, such as the ureteropelvic and ure-
terovesical junctions, bladder neck, and urethral meatus, are common 
sites of obstruction. When lower UTO is above the level of the bladder, 
unilateral dilatation of the ureter (hydroureter) and renal pyelocalyceal 
system  (hydronephrosis)  occurs;  lesions  at  or  below  the  level  of  the 
bladder cause bilateral involvement.

Common forms of obstruction are listed in Table 319-1. Childhood 
causes include congenital malformations, such as narrowing of the ure-
teropelvic junction (UPJ) and abnormal insertion of the ureter into the 
bladder, the most common cause. Vesicoureteral reflux in the absence 
of  urinary  tract  infection  or  bladder  neck  obstruction  often  resolves 
with age. Reinsertion of the ureter into the bladder is indicated if reflux 
is severe and unlikely to improve spontaneously, if renal function dete-
riorates, or if urinary tract infections recur despite chronic antimicro-
bial therapy. Vesicoureteral reflux may cause prenatal hydronephrosis 
and, if severe, can lead to recurrent urinary infections, hypertension, 
and renal scarring in childhood. Posterior urethral valves are the most 
common  cause  of  bilateral  hydronephrosis  in  boys.  In  adults,  UTO 
is due mainly to acquired defects. Pelvic tumors, calculi, and urethral 
stricture predominate. Ligation of, or injury to, the ureter during pel-
vic or colonic surgery can lead to hydronephrosis which, if unilateral, 
may  remain  undetected.  Obstructive  uropathy  may  also  result  from 
extrinsic  neoplastic  (carcinoma  of  cervix  or  colon)  or  inflammatory 
disorders.  Lymphomas,  particularly  follicular,  and  pelvic  or  colonic 
neoplasms  with  retroperitoneal  involvement  are  causes  of  ureteral

obstruction. As many as 50% of men aged >40 years may have lower 
urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
but these symptoms may occur without bladder outlet obstruction.

Functional impairment of urine flow occurs when voiding is altered 
by  abnormal  pontine  or  sacral  centers  of  micturition  control.  It 
may  be  asymptomatic  or  associated  with  lower  urinary  tract  symp-
toms such as frequency, urgency, and postmicturition incontinence, 
nocturia,  straining  to  void,  slow  stream,  hesitancy,  or  a  feeling  of 
incomplete  emptying.  A  history  should  be  sought  for  trauma,  back 
injury,  surgery,  diabetes,  neurologic  or  psychiatric  conditions,  and 
medications.  Causes  include  neurogenic  bladder,  often  with  ady-
namic ureter, and vesicoureteral reflux. Reflux in children may result 
in  severe  unilateral  or  bilateral  hydroureter  and  hydronephrosis. 
Overflow  urinary  incontinence  combined  with  sudden-onset  fecal 
incontinence, severe lower back pain, and saddle anesthesia, requires 
emergency evaluation for possible cauda equina syndrome. Urinary 
retention may be the consequence of α-adrenergic and anticholiner-
gic agents, as well as opiates. Hydronephrosis in pregnancy is due to 
relaxational  effects  of  progesterone  on  smooth  muscle  of  the  renal 
pelvis, as well as ureteral compression by the enlarged uterus, more 
often on the right side.

Diagnostic  tools  to  identify  anatomic  obstruction  include  urinary 
flow  measurements  and  a  postvoid  residual.  Bladder  volume  may 
be  readily  assessed  by  bedside  ultrasound.  Cystourethroscopy  and 
urodynamic  studies  may  be  reserved  for  the  symptomatic  patient  to 
assess the filling phase (cystometry), pressure-volume relationship of 
the bladder, bladder compliance, and capacity. Pressure-flow analysis 
evaluates  bladder  contractility  and  bladder  outlet  resistance  during 
voiding.  Bladder  obstruction  is  characterized  by  high  pressures  in 
women, whereas in men, a diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction is 
based on flow rate and voiding pressures. A voiding cystourethrogram 

may be useful in evaluating incomplete emptying and bladder neck and 
urethral pathology.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The pathophysiology and clinical features of UTO are summarized in 
Table 319-2. Flank pain, the symptom that most commonly leads to 
medical attention, is due to distention of the collecting system or renal 
capsule. Pain severity is influenced more by the rate at which distention 
develops than by the degree of distention. Acute supravesical obstruc-
tion, as from a stone lodged in a ureter (Chap. 318), is associated with 
excruciating, sometimes intermittent, pain, known as renal colic. This 
pain often radiates to the lower abdomen, testes, or labia. By contrast, 
more insidious causes of obstruction, such as chronic narrowing of the 
UPJ, may produce little or no pain and yet result in total destruction 
of the affected kidney. Flank pain that occurs only with micturition is 
pathognomonic of vesicoureteral reflux.

Obstruction of urine flow results in an increase in hydrostatic pres-
sures proximal to the site of obstruction. It is this buildup of pressure 
that  leads  to  the  accompanying  pain,  the  distention  of  the  collecting 
system in the kidney, and elevated intratubular pressures that initiate 
tubular  dysfunction.  In  the  first  days  of  obstruction,  the  dilatation 
of  the  poorly  compliant  collecting  system  may  be  minimal.  As  the 
increased hydrostatic pressure is expressed in the urinary space of the 
glomeruli, further filtration decreases or stops completely.

Azotemia  develops  when  overall  excretory  function  is  impaired, 
often in the setting of bladder outlet obstruction, bilateral renal pelvic 
or ureteric obstruction, or unilateral disease in a patient with a solitary 
functioning  kidney.  Complete  bilateral  obstruction  should  be  sus-
pected when acute renal failure is accompanied by anuria. Any patient 
with  renal  failure  otherwise  unexplained,  or  with  a  history  of  neph-
rolithiasis, hematuria, diabetes mellitus, prostatic enlargement, pelvic 
surgery, trauma, or tumor should be evaluated for UTO.

In  the  acute  setting,  partial,  bilateral  obstruction  may  mimic  pre-
renal  azotemia  with  a  high  blood  urea  nitrogen-to-creatinine  ratio, 
concentrated  urine,  and  sodium  retention.  Renal  vascular  resistance 
may be increased. However, with more prolonged obstruction, symp-
toms of polyuria and nocturia commonly accompany partial UTO and 
result from loss of medullary hypertonicity with diminished renal con-
centrating ability. Failure to produce urine free of salt (natriuresis) is 
due to downregulation of salt reabsorption in the proximal tubule and

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractof transport proteins including the Na+, K+ adenosine triphosphatase 
(ATPase),  Na:K:2Cl  cotransporter  (NKCC2)  in  the  thick  ascending 
limb,  and  the  epithelial  Na+  channel  (ENaC)  in  collecting  duct  cells. 
In addition to direct effects on renal transport mechanisms, increased 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (due to induction of cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2]), 
angiotensin II (with its downregulation of Na+ transporters), and atrial 
or B-type natriuretic peptides (ANP or BNP) due to volume expansion 
in the azotemic patient contribute to decreased salt reabsorption along 
the nephron. Nitric oxide synthases (NOS) in ureteral smooth muscle 
and  urothelial  tissues  have  been  found  to  oppose  the  high  ureteral 
pressure in unilateral obstruction.

Dysregulation of aquaporin-2 water channels in the collecting duct 
contributes to the polyuria. The defect usually does not improve with 
administration of vasopressin and is therefore a form of acquired neph-
rogenic diabetes insipidus.

Wide  fluctuations  in  urine  output  in  a  patient  with  azotemia 
should  always  raise  the  possibility  of  intermittent  or  partial  UTO. 
If  fluid  intake  is  inadequate,  severe  dehydration  and  hypernatremia 
may  develop.  However,  as  with  other  causes  of  poor  renal  func-
tion,  excesses  of  salt  and  water  intake  may  result  in  edema  and 
hyponatremia.

Partial bilateral UTO often results in acquired distal renal tubular 
acidosis,  hyperkalemia,  and  renal  salt  wasting.  The  H+-ATPase,  situ-
ated on the apical membrane of the intercalated cells of the collecting 
duct, is critical for distal H+ secretion. The trafficking of intracellular 
H+ pumps from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane is disrupted in 
UTO. The decreased function of the ENaC, in the apical membrane of 
neighboring  collecting  duct  principal  cells,  contributes  to  decreased 
Na+  reabsorption  (salt-wasting),  and,  therefore,  decreased  K+  secre-
tion via K+ channels. Ammonium (NH4 +) excretion important to the 
elimination  of  H+  is  impaired.  These  defects  in  tubule  function  are 
often accompanied by renal tubulointerstitial damage. Azotemia with 
hyperkalemia  and  metabolic  acidosis  should  prompt  consideration  
of UTO.

The  renal  interstitium  becomes  edematous  and  infiltrated  with 
mononuclear inflammatory cells early in UTO. Later, interstitial fibro-
sis and atrophy of the papillae and medulla occur and precede these 
processes in the cortex. The increase in angiotensin II noted in UTO 

contributes to the inflammatory response and fibroblast accumulation 
through mechanisms involving profibrotic cytokines. With time, this 
process leads to chronic kidney damage.

UTO  must  always  be  considered  in  patients  with  urinary  tract 
infections  or  urolithiasis.  Urinary  stasis  encourages  the  growth  of 
organisms.  Urea-splitting  bacteria  are  associated  with  magnesium 
ammonium  phosphate  (struvite)  calculi  that  may  take  on  a  staghorn 
appearance. Hypertension is frequent in acute and subacute unilateral 
obstruction and is usually a consequence of increased release of renin 
by  the  involved  kidney.  Chronic  kidney  disease  from  bilateral  UTO, 
often  associated  with  extracellular  volume  expansion,  may  result  in 
significant  hypertension.  Erythrocytosis,  an  infrequent  complication 
of  obstructive  uropathy,  is  secondary  to  increased  erythropoietin 
production.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
A history of difficulty in voiding, pain, infection, or change in urinary 
volume is common. Evidence for distention of the kidney or urinary 
bladder can often be obtained by palpation and percussion of the abdo-
men. A careful rectal and genital examination may reveal enlargement 
or nodularity of the prostate, abnormal rectal sphincter tone, or a rectal 
or pelvic mass.

Urinalysis may reveal hematuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria. The urine 
sediment  is  often  normal,  even  when  obstruction  leads  to  marked 
azotemia and extensive structural damage. An abdominal scout film, 
although  insensitive,  may  detect  nephrocalcinosis  or  a  radiopaque 
stone.  As  indicated  in  Fig.  319-1,  if  UTO  is  suspected,  a  bladder 
catheter  should  be  inserted.  Abdominal  ultrasonography  should  be 
performed to evaluate renal and bladder size, as well as pyelocalyceal 
contour. Ultrasonography is ~90% specific and sensitive for detection 
of  hydronephrosis.  False-positive  results  are  associated  with  diuresis, 
renal cysts, or the presence of an extrarenal pelvis, a normal congen-
ital  variant.  Congenital  UPJ  obstruction  may  be  mistaken  for  renal 
cystic  disease.  Hydronephrosis  may  be  absent  on  ultrasound  when 
obstruction is <48 h in duration or associated with volume contraction, 
staghorn  calculi,  retroperitoneal  fibrosis,  or  infiltrative  renal  disease. 
Duplex  Doppler  ultrasonography  may  detect  an  increased  resistive 
index in urinary obstruction.

Recent  advances  in  technology  have  led  to  alternatives  and  have 
replaced the once standard intravenous urogram in the further eval-
uation  of  UTO.  The  high-resolution  multidetector  row  computed 
tomography (CT) scan in particular has the advantages of visualizing 
the retroperitoneum, as well as identifying both intrinsic and extrin-
sic sites of obstruction. Noncontrast CT scans improve visualization 
of the urinary tract in the patient with renal impairment and are safer 
for  patients  at  risk  for  contrast  nephropathy.  Magnetic  resonance 
urography  is  not  at  this  time  superior  to  the  CT  scan  and  certain 
gadolinium agents carry a risk of systemic sclerosis in patients with 
renal  insufficiency.  Recently,  promising  alternatives  to  gadolinium 
have emerged. CT scanning may define the site of obstruction, iden-
tify  and  characterize  kidney  stones,  and  demonstrate  dilatation  of 
the calyces, renal pelvis, and ureter above the obstruction. The ureter 
may be tortuous in chronic obstruction. Though radionuclide scans 
give less anatomic detail than CT scans, they are able to give differ-
ential  renal  function.  In  the  case  of  asymmetric  renal  function,  the 
clinician may decide on a preferable kidney to decompress in the case 
of  bilateral  obstruction.  Furosemide  is  sometimes  given  to  increase 
detection with imaging, and to distinguish functional from anatomic 
obstruction. The increase in urinary flow may bring out the pain of 
an acute obstructive process.

To facilitate visualization of a suspected lesion in a ureter or renal 
pelvis, retrograde or antegrade urography should be attempted. These 
procedures do not carry risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury 
in patients with renal insufficiency. The retrograde approach involves 
catheterization  of  the  involved  ureter  under  cystoscopic  control, 
whereas the antegrade technique necessitates percutaneous placement 
of  a  catheter  into  the  renal  pelvis.  Although  the  antegrade  approach 
may  provide  immediate  decompression  of  a  unilateral  obstructing 
lesion, many urologists initially attempt the retrograde approach unless 
the catheterization is unsuccessful.

Voiding  cystourethrography  is  of  value  in  the  diagnosis  of  vesi-
coureteral  reflux  and  bladder  neck  and  urethral  obstructions.  Post-
voiding  films  reveal  residual  urine.  Endoscopic  visualization  by  the 
urologist  often  permits  precise  identification  of  lesions  involving  the 
urethra, prostate, bladder, and ureteral orifices.

TREATMENT
Urinary Tract Obstruction

UTO complicated by infection requires immediate relief of obstruc-
tion to prevent development of generalized sepsis and progressive 
renal  damage.  Sepsis  necessitates  prompt  urologic  intervention. 
Drainage may be achieved by nephrostomy, ureterostomy, or ure-
teral, urethral, or suprapubic catheterization. Prolonged antibiotic 
treatment  may  be  necessary.  Chronic  or  recurrent  infections  in  a 
poorly  functioning  obstructed  kidney  may  necessitate  nephrec-
tomy. When infection is not present, surgery is often delayed until 
acid-base, fluid, and electrolyte status is restored. Nevertheless, the 
site of obstruction should be ascertained as soon as feasible. Elective 
relief of obstruction is usually recommended in patients with urinary 
retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, persistent pain, or pro-
gressive  loss  of  renal  function.  Benign  prostatic  hypertrophy  may 
be treated medically with α-adrenergic blockers and 5α-reductase 
inhibitors. Renal colic may be treated with anti-inflammatory med-
ication as edema often contributes to an obstructing ureteral stone, 
and  α-adrenergic  blockers  may  also  be  of  benefit.  The  clinician 
should be aware of the risk of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome 
associated with cataract surgery in patients taking α-adrenergic block-
ers.  Use  of  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  medication  must  take 
into  account  the  potential  for  renal  harm,  and  opiates  in  patients 
with  decreased  renal  function  may  be  dangerous  and  should  be 
used with caution. Functional obstruction secondary to neurogenic 
bladder may be decreased with the combination of frequent voiding 
and cholinergic drugs.

 ■ PROGNOSIS
With  relief  of  obstruction,  the  prognosis  regarding  return  of  renal 
function  depends  largely  on  whether  irreversible  renal  damage  has 
occurred.  When  obstruction  is  not  relieved,  the  course  will  depend 
mainly  on  whether  the  obstruction  is  complete  or  incomplete  and 
bilateral or unilateral, as well as whether or not urinary tract infection 
is also present. Complete obstruction with infection can lead to total 
destruction of the kidney within days. Partial return of glomerular fil-
tration rate may follow relief of complete obstruction of 1 and 2 weeks’ 
duration, but after 8 weeks of obstruction, recovery is unlikely. In the 
absence of definitive evidence of irreversibility, every effort should be 
made  to  decompress  the  obstruction  in  the  hope  of  restoring  renal 
function at least partially. A renal radionuclide scan, performed after a 
prolonged period of decompression, may be used to predict the revers-
ibility of renal dysfunction.

 ■ POSTOBSTRUCTIVE DIURESIS
Relief  of  bilateral,  but  not  unilateral,  complete  obstruction  commonly 
results in polyuria, which may be massive. The urine is usually hypotonic 
and  may  contain  large  amounts  of  sodium  chloride,  potassium,  phos-
phate, and magnesium. The natriuresis is due in part to the correction 
of  extracellular  volume  expansion,  the  increase  in  natriuretic  factors 
accumulated during the period of renal failure, and depressed salt and 
water reabsorption when urine flow is reestablished. The retained urea 
is  excreted  with  improved  GFR,  resulting  in  an  osmotic  diuresis  that 
increases the urine volume of electrolyte-free water. Electrolyte-free water 
excretion (hypotonic urine) is recognized as being present when the sum 
of the urinary concentrations of sodium and potassium, is lower than the 
serum sodium concentration.  Causes include suppression of antidiuretic 
hormone at arterial baroreceptor sites or elevation of atrial peptides, and 
nephrogenic diabetes insidpidus due to obstructive tubular injury. In the 
majority of patients, this diuresis results in the appropriate excretion of 
the excesses of retained salt and water. When extracellular volume and 
composition return to normal, the diuresis usually abates spontaneously. 
Occasionally, iatrogenic expansion of extracellular volume is responsible 
for,  or  sustains,  the  diuresis  observed  in  the  postobstructive  period. 
Replacement with intravenous fluids in amounts less than urinary losses 
usually prevents this complication. More aggressive fluid management is 
required in the setting of hypovolemia, hypotension, or disturbances in 
serum electrolyte concentrations.

The  loss  of  electrolyte-free  water  with  urea  may  result  in  hyper-
natremia.  Measured  urinary  output  and  serum  and  urine  sodium, 
potassium, and osmolal concentrations should guide the use of appro-
priate intravenous replacement. Often replacement with 0.45% saline 
is required. Relief of obstruction may be followed by urinary salt and 
water losses severe enough to provoke profound dehydration and vas-
cular collapse. In these patients, decreased tubule reabsorptive capacity 
is probably responsible for the marked diuresis. Appropriate therapy in 
such  patients  includes  intravenous  administration  of  salt-containing 
solutions to replace sodium and volume deficits.

Dirk M. Hentschel

Interventional  nephrology  is  a  procedure-oriented  subspecialty  with 
a  focus  on  dialysis  access  for  peritoneal  and  hemodialysis,  typically 
performed under fluoroscopy. Ultrasound (US) evaluation of dialysis 
access  is  common  and  some  practitioners  perform  renal  and  renal 
artery US evaluation as well as renal biopsies. Endovascular creation 
of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) is a recent addition to the procedural 
spectrum;  (open)  surgical  access  creation  by  nephrologists  is  limited 
to very few centers in the United States, while common in China, 
Germany, India, and Italy.

Interventional  nephrologists  (INs)  usually  provide  patient  care  in 
multidisciplinary  teams  that  include  clinical  nephrologists;  access 
surgeons  with  vascular,  transplant,  or  general  surgery  background; 
other  interventionalists  (with  radiology  or  cardiology  training);  and 
dialysis  unit  access  coordinators,  nurses,  and  technicians  involved  in 
needle placement. Long-term preservation of venous and arterial vas-
cular access options is one tenet of chronic kidney disease (CKD) care, 
leading INs to advocate for specific vascular access options (tunneled 
small-diameter  catheters  over  peripherally  inserted  central  catheters 
[PICCs]) and cardiac devices (epicardial rather than endovascular lead 
passage).

 ■ HISTORY
The  history  of  vascular  access  for  hemodialysis  is  closely  tied  to  the 
history of dialysis. The first hemodialysis treatments in humans were 
performed in 1924 using glass needles to access the radial artery and 
return blood into the cubital vein. In 1943 a “rotating drum kidney” 
was  used  to  dialyze  a  29-year-old  housemaid  with  CKD  by  surgical 
exposure of different arteries until she ran out of access sites after 12 
treatments. The challenge of repetitive vascular access prevented dial-
ysis from becoming a routine method for the treatment of CKD until 
the development of an arteriovenous Teflon shunt and then the devel-
opment of an autogenous arterial-venous access (arteriovenous fistula, 
AVF)  by  side-to-side-anastomoses  between  the  radial  artery  and  the 
cephalic vein at the wrist (Cimino fistula). Catheter-based approaches 
for chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) were designed initially in 
1961 for hemodialysis and in 1968 for peritoneal dialysis, both using 
Dacron felt cuffs to protect against infection.

Material sciences have continued to evolve the development of grafts 
for  use  in  hemodialysis.  A  modified  bovine  carotid  artery  biological 
graft was introduced in 1972, followed by the use of expanded polyte-
trafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts in 1976, and, most recently in 2016, 
tissue-engineered blood vessels from human fibroblasts and endothe-
lial cells. Some ePTFE grafts are modified with a silicone layer to allow 
for early cannulation within days of insertion. Ultra-high-pressure (up 
to 40 atm) angioplasty balloons are a mainstay of peripheral and central 
venous therapy, and Nitinol self-expanding stents and stent grafts serve 
as  rescue  tools  for  unsuccessful  angioplasty  as  well  as  vessel  rupture 
with extravasation.

 ■ PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF 
DIALYSIS ACCESS
Peritoneal  Dialysis  Peritoneal  dialysis  (PD)  catheters  can  be 
placed fluoroscopically, peritoneoscopically, laparoscopically, and open 
surgically. Procedural success is typically linked to provider experience 
and  procedural  planning  to  optimize  positioning  of  the  PD  catheter 
coil  as  this  improves  function  and  decreases  drain  pain  and  other 
complications. The internal cuff is placed within the rectus sheath just 
laterally to the linea alba, while the external PD catheter cuff should be 
located 2–4 cm from the skin exit site. Ingrowth of both cuffs ensures 
secure  positioning  of  the  catheter  and  allows  water  emersion.  Over 
time the peritoneal catheter can become encased in a fibrous sheath, 
which,  if  limiting  fluid  flow  during  exchanges,  can  be  disrupted  by 

guidewire  manipulation.  Omental  entrapment  of  the  catheter  often 
requires  laparoscopic  intervention;  omentopexy  at  the  time  of  PD 
catheter placement can prevent later entrapment. Repeated infections 
affect the permeability of the peritoneal membrane, as does long-term 
exposure  to  glucose-containing  exchange  solutions.  Encapsulating 
peritoneal  sclerosis  is  a  late-stage  complication  of  PD  thought  to  be 
triggered by repeated peritonitis.

Hemodialysis  Catheters  Dialysis  catheters  are  typically  made 
of  polyurethane  that  softens  at  body  temperature  but  is  sufficiently 
strong  to  allow  for  blood  flow  rates  of  400–500  mL/min  in  each  of 
two  channels  inside  a  14.5–16  French  design  without  collapse  of  the 
catheter  lumen.  Tunneled  catheters  have  a  cuff  that  creates  a  barrier 
between skin flora at the exit site and the sterile catheter tunnel leading 
into the fibrous sheath covering the catheter from the vessel insertion 
point to its tip. The fibrous sheath can extend too far, impeding cathe-
ter flow and necessitating exchange of the catheter with disruption of 
the sheath by balloon angioplasty. Catheter-related bacteremia is best 
treated  with  exchange  of  the  catheter  and  disruption  of  any  fibrous 
sheath, although removal of the catheter and delayed reinsertion after 
several days is also successful. Thrombotic occlusion and later sclerotic 
scarring  of  the  vein  at  catheter  insertion  sites  is  common,  however, 
and removal of a catheter may lead to loss of this access site. Catheter 
wall contact points are thought to lead to central vein stenosis, which 
is more commonly observed in patients with catheter contact times of 
longer duration (>3 months). Catheter tip position in the large central 
veins instead of the right atrium causes additional injury from dynamic 
blood movement during dialysis treatments and should be corrected. A 
thrombus is commonly found attached to the catheter, often tethering 
the catheter to the vessel wall and right atrium. While some thrombi 
are mobile and dissolve with anticoagulation, a wall-tethered thrombus 
is often well organized with cellular components and quite resistant to 
pharmacologic lysis. Clinically significant pulmonary embolism from 
catheter-associated thrombus is rare, and it may be that only intra-atrial 
thrombus >2 cm in diameter deserves active intervention.

 ■ ARTERIOVENOUS GRAFTS AND FISTULAS
During  the  first  decades  of  hemodialysis  for  loss  of  renal  function, 
US  patients  were  relatively  young  and  without  long-term  systemic 
vascular disease. Creation of forearm Cimino AVFs was common, and 
access failure usually led to creation of a second AVF slightly higher 
up on the arm. As diabetes and hypertension with associated systemic 
arterial  and  venous  vascular  disease  became  more  prevalent  in  the 
CKD population, placement of nonautogenous accesses (arteriovenous 
grafts [AVGs]) increased. In the mid-1990s, 65% of prevalent dialysis 
patients used an AVG for access. The US was an international outlier 
in this regard, and studies associated increased mortality in US dialysis 
patients  with  lower  AVF  prevalence.  In  the  context  of  “Fistula  First” 
and  then  “Fistula  First,  Catheter  Last”  campaigns,  AVG  prevalence 
decreased to its current value of less than 20%, while AVFs increased 
to near 65% prevalence. However, most centers still struggle with the 
challenging conditions of arteries and veins in these patients requiring 
that 75% of AVFs are now created in the upper arm, where the veins a 
priori are larger in diameter, and arteries can deliver higher blood flow 
rates due to large vessel diameter (see Fig. 320-1).

To provide successful dialysis, an AVF or AVG has to provide at least 
the desired blood pump speed (see Chap. 312) plus 100–200 mL/min 
to  minimize  recirculation  and  prevent  collapse  of  the  access.  In  the 
United States, this usually means flow in the 600–800 mL/min range. 
After creation of the arterial-venous anastomosis (or insertion of the 
AVG),  blood  flow  increases  significantly:  brachial  artery  flow  at  rest  
is typically <50 mL/min, but after access creation flow volume in AVFs 
increases  within  weeks  to  800  mL/min,  while  flow  volume  in  AVGs 
increases within minutes to 1000 mL/min. The increased flow changes 
the arterial shear stress profile and leads to enlargement of the artery 
over  time.  In  AVGs,  this  process  is  limited  by  the  graft  itself,  which 
typically is 6 mm in diameter and 35–40 cm long, and access flows are 
1200–1800 mL/min. The access vein in AVFs in the right shear stress 
environment enlarges over time, often to >10 mm in diameter in the

upper  arm  such  that  the  artery  continues  to  enlarge  until  a  narrow 
segment in the venous conduit becomes flow limiting. Flow volumes 
in these mature upper arm AVFs are usually 1400–1800 mL/min, but 
after a few years can be as high as 2000–4000 mL/min. Forearm AVFs 
usually  have  lower  flow  volumes  (600–800  mL/min)  as  the  feeding 
radial  artery  is  of  smaller  diameter,  and  in  the  context  of  systemic 
vascular disease in the United States, only increases in diameter over 
many years.

Increased  flows  and  pressure  in  the  venous  segment  of  the  access 
circuit combine to lead to “chronic dialysis access disease” that man-
ifests  differently  for  each  type  of  the  common  long-term  accesses  in 
predetermined segments particularly prone to shear stress and needle 
insertion-related  injury.  AVGs  develop  venous  anastomotic  stenoses 
that recur with very short periodicity in the 3- to 4-month range. Stent 
grafts can effectively be deployed to extend patency for usually 1 year 
at the site, after which the buildup of pauci-cellular fibrous depositions 
at the stent edges requires re-angioplasty one to three times per year. 
Forearm  radial-cephalic  autogenous  accesses  are  most  prone  to  low 
flow due to juxta-anastomotic stenoses. Over time, these stenoses can 
stabilize,  and  with  enlargement  of  the  inflow  artery,  they  effectively 
provide  protection  against  excessive  flows  and  their  sequelae.  Upper 
arm  brachial-cephalic  autogenous  accesses  typically  develop  stenoses 
in  the  cephalic  arch,  which  recur  in  accelerated  fashion  after  each 
angioplasty.  Flexible  stent  grafts  in  the  cephalic  arch  extend  intrap-
rocedural  intervals  usually  to  9–12  months.  Upper  arm  transposed  
brachial-basilic  autogenous  accesses  develop  stenoses  in  the  swing 
point  where  the  basilic  vein  is  curved  to  provide  a  location  more 
lateral  and  closer  to  the  skin  to  facilitate  ready  cannulation.  Angio-
plasty  and  stent  graft  placement  approaches  extend  patency.  In  both 
types  of  upper  arm  accesses,  there  are  often  prolonged  periods  with 
increased  intra-access  pressures  due  to  outflow  stenoses,  which  lead 
to enlargement of needle insertion site aneurysm as the skin heals in 
a  pressurized,  stretched  state.  Continued  use  of  pressurized  accesses 
leads  to  enlargement  of  needle  sites,  then  thinning  of  the  skin,  scab 
formation, and, finally, full thickness ulceration with often significant 
bleeding events. Recognizing the occurrence of outflow stenoses early 
is an important skill for nurses and technologists working in dialysis 
units to learn in order to avoid irreversible loss of skin coverage, which 
can result in loss of the access.

High-access flow can lead to systemic complications, such as heart 
failure  and  pulmonary  hypertension.  Fistula  inflow  higher  than  out-
flow capacity leads to accelerated aneurysm formation and breakdown 
of skin coverage as intra-access pressures are increased over the ideal 
pressure of 20–35 mmHg. High-access flows are also associated with 
steal syndrome, typically ischemia of the hand. A variety of procedures 
have been described to reduce access flows, the most common being 
“banding,” where a 2-0 Prolene suture is guided around the inflow and 
a 3- or 4-mm spacer once or twice and is tied snugly over the spacer.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Physical Examination of Dialysis Access

The 2019 KDOQI vascular access guidelines were developed under 
the tenet, “[t]he right access for the right patient at the right time.” 
Progression of CKD is highly variable, many patients die from other 
causes before reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and some 
AVFs require 6–12 months to mature to usability in patients with 
HTN and diabetes leading to uncertainty as to when to create AVFs. 
The  more  common  need  of  upper  arm  accesses  for  interventions 
to maintain patency favors the creation of forearm accesses during 
the  pre-ESRD  period.  The  processes  of  care  from  vein  mapping, 
surgery,  follow-up  visits  after  access  creation,  to  availability  and 
timing  of  open  surgical  or  endovascular  interventions  have  pro-
found effects on the overall success rate needed to achieve mature 
and usable accesses, and appear to be key factor with highly variable 
outcomes across the United States.

A central skill in dialysis access evaluation is the physical exami-
nation.  Five  aspects  capture  all  aspects  of  possible  pathology: 
Pulsatility reflects the force of access expansion during systole and 
the degree of softening during diastole. Very high blood pressures 
will suggest increased pulsatility, but the access softens remarkably 
during diastole. An outflow stenosis will lead to increased pulsatil-
ity and reduced softening during diastole. An inflow stenosis will 
blunt with the systolic component and create the impression of an 
“empty” access during diastole unless there is a coexisting outflow 
stenosis.  The  audible  flow  murmur  can  be  characterized  by  pitch

PART 9Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tractand  continuity  (Video  320-1).  A  change  in  pitch  toward  higher 
frequency is typical at the site of a stenosis due to accelerated flow 
velocity  at  this  site.  A  discontinuous  flow  murmur  indicates  that 
during diastole flow is so low that no audible shear force is created; 
this is the sign of a severe inflow or outflow stenosis. Typically, the 
stenotic inflow murmur is faint (like a whistle), whereas the stenotic 
outflow  murmur  can  be  coarse  and  loud  (akin  to  a  handsaw) 
(Video 320-2). A thrill is palpable through the skin when the vessel 
is close enough to the surface and the flow high enough in relation 
to the diameter of the vessel to create vibration of the vessel wall. A 
continuous thrill can be a sign of a well-developed access, usually 
in  the  inflow  segment,  dissipating  as  the  access  vessel  branches 
and  takes  a  deeper  course.  In  contrast,  a  discontinuous  thrill  is 
found with severe stenosis. An isolated thrill is also found focally 
immediately  after  a  stenosis.  The  differentiation  from  a  “healthy” 
thrill  can  be  made  by  documenting  a  change  in  pulsatility  at  the 
site of the focal thrill, increased retrograde (inflow) and decreased 
antegrade  (outflow).  Augmentation  is  the  engorgement  of  the 
body of the access (where needles are inserted) with occlusion of 
the outflow necessary for safe and successful needle insertions. An 
inflow stenosis will impair augmentation as will side-branches and 
collaterals between the occluding finger/tourniquet and the inflow. 
The  location  of  side-branches  can  be  elucidated  by  moving  the 
occluding finger closer toward the anastomosis until augmentation 
is achieved. With several collaterals, this may be a staged phenom-
enon.  Collapse of the access  with  arm  elevation  (against  gravity) 
is a measure of inflow and outflow capacity match or mismatch. A 
forearm access typically displays complete collapse while upper arm 
accesses  typically  show  only  partial  collapse.  An  outflow  stenosis 
or very high inflow will decrease the degree of collapse; banding of 
an upper arm access or a natural flow limiting stenosis may lead to 
complete collapse of an upper arm access.

Enlarged needle insertion sites (and any sites of suspected skin 
thinning) are best examined while occluding inflow: the completely 
empty  access  allows  palpation  of  a  firm,  layered  thrombus  inside 
aneurysms as well as a better appreciation of the thickness of the 
overlying  skin  by  rolling  it  between  thumb  and  index  finger.  The 
chest  wall  and  neck  should  be  inspected  for  the  presence  of  skin 
veins  and  venous  distention,  which  are  associated  with  central 
venous stenosis or occlusion, as is ipsilateral arm edema. 
PRESERVATION OF VENOUS “REAL ESTATE”
Preserving  access  is  a  key  care  component  for  the  patient  with 
advancing CKD. Approximately 8–10% of this population has the 
need  for  cardiac  rhythm  management  devices  (CRMDs)  that  can

lead to loss of the upper arm cephalic vein as well as central venous 
stenoses  and  occlusions  around  device  leads.  Planning  for  which 
side a future autogenous access is to be placed and where a CRMD 
is located is recommended in all cases. CKD patients also have an 
increased  frequency  of  hospitalizations,  some  of  which  require 
intravenous  access  beyond  the  hospital  stay  for  antibiotics,  nutri-
tional support, or hydration. Avoiding PICCs in a patient with CKD 
stage 3 or 3b, and, instead, using internal (or external) jugular vein 
tunneled  small-diameter  catheters  preserves  arm  veins  for  long-
term access creation. Arterial access points for cardiac procedures 
should be chosen with AVF creation in mind.

Approach to the dialysis access of patients with a kidney trans-
plant depends on the function of the transplanted kidney, the risk 
of recurrence of kidney disease in the transplant, the ability to limit 
access  flow  over  time  while  maintaining  patency,  as  well  as  the 
potential benefit of the AVF for blood pressure control.
