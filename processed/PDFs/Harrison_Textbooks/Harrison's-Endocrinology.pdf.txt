PART 12

Section 1  Endocrinology

376 Approach to the 
Patient with Endocrine 
Disorders
J. Larry Jameson

The  management  of  endocrine  disorders  requires  a  broad  under-
standing  of  intermediary  metabolism,  reproductive  physiology,  bone 
metabolism,  and  growth.  Accordingly,  the  practice  of  endocrinology 
is intimately linked to a conceptual framework for understanding hor-
mone  secretion,  hormone  action,  and  principles  of  feedback  control 
(Chap.  377).  The  endocrine  system  is  evaluated  primarily  by  mea-
suring  hormone  concentrations,  arming  the  clinician  with  valuable 
diagnostic  information.  Most  disorders  of  the  endocrine  system  are 
amenable  to  effective  treatment  once  the  correct  diagnosis  is  estab-
lished.  Endocrine  deficiency  disorders  are  treated  with  physiologic 
hormone  replacement;  hormone  excess  conditions,  which  usually 
are caused by benign glandular adenomas, are managed by removing 
tumors surgically or reducing hormone levels medically.
SCOPE OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
Classically,  the  specialty  of  endocrinology  encompasses  the  study 
of  glands  and  the  hormones  they  produce.  Over  time,  the  field  has 
expanded  because  of  the  discovery  of  hormones  and  growth  factors 
produced by the brain, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, musculoskeletal sys-
tem, and other nonglandular organs. The term endocrine was coined by 
Starling to contrast the actions of hormones secreted internally (endo-
crine) with those secreted externally (exocrine) or into a lumen, such as 
the GI tract. The term hormone, derived from a Greek phrase meaning 
“to  set  in  motion,”  aptly  describes  the  dynamic  actions  of  hormones 
as  they  elicit  cellular  responses  and  regulate  physiologic  processes 
through feedback mechanisms.

Unlike many other specialties in medicine, it is not possible to define 
endocrinology  strictly  along  anatomic  lines.  The  classic  endocrine 
glands—pituitary,  thyroid,  parathyroid,  pancreatic  islets,  adrenals, 
and  gonads—communicate  broadly  with  other  organs  through  the 
nervous system, hormones, cytokines, and growth factors. In addition 
to  its  traditional  synaptic  functions,  the  brain  produces  a  vast  array 
of peptide hormones, and this has led to the discipline of neuroendo-
crinology. Through the production of hypothalamic releasing factors, 
the central nervous system (CNS) exerts a major regulatory influence 
over pituitary hormone secretion (Chap. 378). The peripheral nervous 
system  stimulates  the  adrenal  medulla.  The  immune  and  endocrine 
systems are also intimately intertwined. The adrenal hormone cortisol 
is  a  powerful  immunosuppressant.  Cytokines  and  interleukins  (ILs) 
have  profound  effects  on  the  functions  of  the  pituitary,  adrenal,  thy-
roid,  and  gonads.  Common  endocrine  diseases  such  as  autoimmune 
thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus are caused by dysregulation 
of immune surveillance and tolerance. Less common diseases such as 
polyglandular failure, Addison’s disease, and lymphocytic hypophysitis 
also have an immunologic basis. Immune therapies for cancer and var-
ious autoimmune diseases can initiate autoimmune endocrine disease 
as a side effect of treatment.

The  interdigitation  of  endocrinology  with  physiologic  processes  in 
other  specialties  sometimes  blurs  the  role  of  hormones.  For  example, 
hormones  play  an  important  role  in  maintenance  of  blood  pressure, 
intravascular  volume,  and  peripheral  resistance  in  the  cardiovascular 
system.  Vasoactive  substances  such  as  catecholamines,  angiotensin  II,  
endothelin,  and  nitric  oxide  are  involved  in  dynamic  changes  of 

vascular  tone  in  addition  to  their  multiple  roles  in  other  tissues.  The 
heart is the principal source of atrial natriuretic peptide, which acts in 
classic endocrine fashion to induce natriuresis at a distant target organ 
(the kidney). Erythropoietin, a traditional circulating hormone, is made 
in the kidney and stimulates erythropoiesis in bone marrow (Chap. 63). 
The  kidney  is  also  integrally  involved  in  the  renin-angiotensin  axis 
(Chap.  386)  and  is  a  primary  target  of  several  hormones,  including 
parathyroid  hormone  (PTH),  mineralocorticoids,  fibroblast  growth 
factor 23 (FGF23), and vasopressin. The GI tract produces a vast array 
of peptide hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), chole-
cystokinin, ghrelin, gastrin, secretin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide, 
among many others. Carcinoid and islet tumors can secrete excessive 
amounts  of  these  hormones,  leading  to  specific  clinical  syndromes 
(Chap. 84). Many of these GI hormones are also produced in the CNS, 
where their functions are poorly understood. Adipose tissue produces 
leptin, which acts centrally to control appetite, along with adiponectin, 
resistin, and other hormones that regulate metabolism. As hormones 
such as inhibin, ghrelin, and leptin are discovered, they become inte-
grated into the science and practice of medicine on the basis of their 
functional roles rather than their tissues of origin.

Characterization  of  hormone  receptors  frequently  reveals  unex-
pected  relationships  to  factors  in  nonendocrine  disciplines.  The 
growth hormone (GH) and leptin receptors, for example, are members 
of  the  cytokine  receptor  family.  The  G  protein–coupled  receptors 
(GPCRs), which mediate the  actions  of many  peptide  hormones,  are 
used in numerous physiologic processes, including vision, smell, and 
neurotransmission.

PATHOLOGIC MECHANISMS OF 
ENDOCRINE DISEASE
Endocrine diseases can be divided into three major types of conditions: 
(1) hormone excess, (2) hormone deficiency, and (3) hormone resis-
tance (Table 376-1).
 ■ CAUSES OF HORMONE EXCESS
Syndromes of hormone excess can be caused by neoplastic growth of 
endocrine  cells,  autoimmune  disorders,  and  excess  hormone  admin-
istration.  Benign  endocrine  tumors,  including  parathyroid,  pituitary, 
and adrenal adenomas, often retain the capacity to produce hormones, 
reflecting  the  fact  that  these  tumors  are  relatively  well  differentiated. 
Many endocrine tumors exhibit subtle defects in their “set points” for 
feedback regulation. For example, in Cushing’s disease, impaired feed-
back inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion is 
associated with autonomous function. However, the tumor cells are not 
completely resistant to feedback, as evidenced by ACTH suppression 
by  higher  doses  of  dexamethasone  (e.g.,  high-dose  dexamethasone 
test) (Chap. 386). Similar set point defects are also typical of parathy-
roid adenomas and autonomously functioning thyroid nodules.

The molecular basis of some endocrine tumors, such as the multiple 
endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes (MEN1, 2A, 2B), has provided 
important  insights  into  tumorigenesis  (Chap.  388).  MEN1  is  char-
acterized  primarily  by  the  triad  of  parathyroid,  pancreatic  islet,  and 
pituitary tumors. MEN2 predisposes to medullary thyroid carcinoma, 
pheochromocytoma,  and  hyperparathyroidism.  The  MEN1  gene, 
located  on  chromosome  11q13,  encodes  a  tumor-suppressor  gene, 
menin. Analogous to the paradigm first described for retinoblastoma, 
the affected individual inherits a mutant copy of the MEN1 gene, and 
tumorigenesis ensues after a somatic “second hit” leads to loss of func-
tion of the normal MEN1 gene (through deletion or point mutations).
In contrast to inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene, as occurs in 
MEN1 and most other inherited cancer syndromes, MEN2 is caused by 
activating mutations in a single allele. In this case, activating mutations 
of the RET protooncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, 
leads  to  thyroid  C-cell  hyperplasia  in  childhood  before  the  develop-
ment of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Elucidation of this pathogenic 
mechanism has allowed early genetic screening for RET mutations in

individuals  at  risk  for  MEN2,  permitting  identification  of  those  who 
may benefit from prophylactic thyroidectomy and biochemical screen-
ing for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism.

Mutations  that  activate  hormone  receptor  signaling  have  been 
identified in several GPCRs. For example, activating mutations of the 
luteinizing  hormone  (LH)  receptor  cause  a  dominantly  transmitted 
form of male-limited precocious puberty, reflecting premature stimu-
lation of testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells (Chap. 391). Activating 
mutations  in  these  GPCRs  are  located  predominantly  in  the  trans-
membrane domains and induce receptor coupling to Gsα even in the 
absence of hormone. Consequently, adenylate cyclase is activated, and 
cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (AMP)  levels  increase  in  a  manner 
that mimics hormone action. A similar phenomenon results from acti-
vating mutations in Gsα. When these mutations occur early in devel-
opment,  they  cause  McCune-Albright  syndrome.  When  they  occur 
only in somatotropes, the activating Gsα mutations cause GH-secreting 
tumors and acromegaly (Chap. 380).

In  autoimmune  Graves’  disease,  antibody  interactions  with  the  
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor mimic TSH action, leading 
to hormone overproduction (Chap. 382). Analogous to the effects of acti-
vating mutations of the TSH receptor, these stimulating autoantibodies 
induce conformational changes in the TSH receptor that release it from 
a constrained state, thereby triggering receptor coupling to G proteins.
 ■ CAUSES OF HORMONE DEFICIENCY
Most examples of hormone deficiency states can be attributed to glan-
dular destruction caused by autoimmunity, surgery, infection, inflam-
mation,  infarction,  hemorrhage,  or  tumor  infiltration  (Table  376-1). 
Autoimmune  damage  to  the  thyroid  gland  (Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis) 
and  pancreatic  islet  β  cells  (type  1  diabetes  mellitus)  are  examples 
of  relatively  common  endocrine  diseases.  Mutations  in  a  number  of 
hormones,  hormone  receptors,  transcription  factors,  enzymes,  and 
channels can also lead to hormone deficiencies.

 ■ HORMONE RESISTANCE
Most severe hormone resistance syndromes are due to inherited defects 
in membrane receptors, nuclear receptors, or the pathways that transduce 
receptor signals. These disorders are characterized by defective hormone 
action  despite  the  presence  of  increased  hormone  levels.  In  complete 
androgen  resistance,  for  example,  mutations  in  the  androgen  receptor 
result  in  a  female  phenotypic  appearance  in  genetic  (XY)  males,  even 
though LH and testosterone levels are increased (Chap. 388). In addition 
to these relatively rare genetic disorders, more common acquired forms 
of  functional  hormone  resistance  include  insulin  resistance  in  type  2 
diabetes mellitus, leptin resistance in obesity, and GH resistance in cata-
bolic states. The pathogenesis of functional resistance involves receptor 
downregulation and postreceptor desensitization of signaling pathways; 
functional forms of resistance are generally reversible.
 ■ CLINICAL EVALUATION OF  
ENDOCRINE DISORDERS
Because  most  glands  are  relatively  inaccessible,  the  physical  exami-
nation  usually  focuses  on  the  manifestations  of  hormone  excess  or 
deficiency  as  well  as  direct  examination  of  palpable  glands,  such  as 
the thyroid and gonads. For these reasons, it is important to evaluate 
patients in the context of their presenting symptoms, review of systems, 
family and social history, and exposure to medications that may affect 
the endocrine system. Astute clinical skills are required to detect subtle 
symptoms  and  signs  suggestive  of  underlying  endocrine  disease.  For 
example,  a  patient  with  Cushing’s  syndrome  may  manifest  specific 
findings,  such  as  central  fat  redistribution,  skin  striae,  and  proximal 
muscle weakness, in addition to features seen commonly in the general 
population, such as obesity, plethora, hypertension, and glucose intol-
erance. Similarly, the insidious onset of hypothyroidism—with mental 
slowing, fatigue, dry skin, and other features—can be difficult to dis-
tinguish from similar, nonspecific findings in the general population. 
Clinical  judgment  that  is  based  on  knowledge  of  disease  prevalence

and  pathophysiology  is  required  to  decide  when  to  embark  on  more 
extensive  evaluation  of  these  disorders.  Laboratory  testing  plays  an 
essential  role  in  endocrinology  by  allowing  quantitative  assessment 
of  hormone  levels  and  dynamics.  Radiologic  imaging  tests  such  as 
computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
thyroid scan, and ultrasound are also used for the diagnosis of endo-
crine disorders. However, these tests generally are employed only after 
a hormonal abnormality has been established by biochemical testing.
 ■ HORMONE MEASUREMENTS AND  
ENDOCRINE TESTING
Immunoassays are the most important diagnostic tool in endocrinol-
ogy,  as  they  allow  sensitive,  specific,  and  quantitative  determination 
of  steady-state  and  dynamic  changes  in  hormone  concentrations. 
Immunoassays use antibodies to detect specific hormones. For many 
peptide hormones, these measurements are now configured to use two 
different antibodies to increase binding affinity and specificity. There 
are many variations of these assays; a common format involves using 
one antibody to capture the antigen (hormone) onto an immobilized 
surface and a second antibody, coupled to a chemiluminescent (immu-
nochemiluminescent  assay  [ICMA])  or  radioactive  (immunoradio-
metric  assay  [IRMA])  signal,  to  detect  the  antigen.  These  assays  are 
sensitive enough to detect plasma hormone concentrations in the pico-
molar to nanomolar range, and they can readily distinguish structur-
ally related proteins, such as PTH from PTH-related peptide (PTHrP). 
A variety of other techniques are used to measure specific hormones, 
including  mass  spectroscopy,  various  forms  of  chromatography,  and 
enzymatic methods; bioassays are now used rarely.

Most hormone measurements are based on plasma or serum sam-
ples. However, urinary hormone determinations remain useful for the 
evaluation of some conditions. Urinary collections over 24 h provide 
an  integrated  assessment  of  the  production  of  a  hormone  or  metab-
olite,  many  of  which  vary  during  the  day.  It  is  important  to  ensure 
complete  collections  of  24-h  urine  samples;  simultaneous  measure-
ment  of  creatinine  provides  an  internal  control  for  the  adequacy  of 
collection and can be used to normalize some hormone measurements. 
A  24-h  urine-free  cortisol  measurement  largely  reflects  the  amount 
of  unbound  cortisol,  thus  providing  a  reasonable  index  of  biologi-
cally available hormone. Other commonly used urine determinations 
include  17-hydroxycorticosteroids,  17-ketosteroids,  vanillylmandelic 
acid,  metanephrine,  catecholamines,  5-hydroxyindoleacetic  acid,  and 
calcium.

The value of quantitative hormone measurements lies in their cor-
rect interpretation in a clinical context. The normal range for most hor-
mones is relatively broad, often varying by a factor of two- to tenfold. 
The normal ranges for many hormones are sex- and age-specific. Thus, 
using the correct normative database is an essential part of interpreting

hormone tests. The pulsatile nature of hormones and factors that can 
affect their secretion, such as sleep, meals, and medications, must also 
be  considered.  Cortisol  values  increase  fivefold  between  midnight 
and dawn; reproductive hormone levels vary dramatically during the 
female menstrual cycle.

For  many  endocrine  systems,  much  information  can  be  gained 
from  basal  hormone  testing,  particularly  when  different  components 
of  an  endocrine  axis  are  assessed  simultaneously.  For  example,  low 
testosterone and elevated LH levels suggest a primary gonadal problem, 
whereas  a  hypothalamic-pituitary  disorder  is  likely  if  both  LH  and 
testosterone  are  low.  Because  TSH  is  a  sensitive  indicator  of  thyroid 
function,  it  is  generally  recommended  as  a  first-line  test  for  thyroid 
disorders. An elevated TSH level is almost always the result of primary 
hypothyroidism, whereas a low TSH is most often caused by thyrotoxi-
cosis. These predictions can be confirmed by determining the free thy-
roxine level. In the less common circumstance when free thyroxine and 
TSH are both low, it is important to consider secondary hypopituitar-
ism  caused  by  hypothalamic-pituitary  disease.  Elevated  calcium  and 
PTH levels suggest hyperparathyroidism, whereas PTH is suppressed 
in  hypercalcemia  caused  by  malignancy  or  granulomatous  diseases. 
A suppressed ACTH in the setting of hypercortisolemia, or increased 
urine free cortisol, is seen with hyperfunctioning adrenal adenomas.

It is not uncommon, however, for baseline hormone levels associated 
with pathologic endocrine conditions to overlap with the normal range. 
In  this  circumstance,  dynamic  testing  is  useful  to  separate  the  two 
groups further. There are a multitude of dynamic endocrine tests, but all 
are based on principles of feedback regulation, and most responses can  
be rationalized based on principles that govern the regulation of endo-
crine axes. Suppression tests are used in the setting of suspected endocrine 
hyperfunction. An example is the dexamethasone suppression test used 
to evaluate Cushing’s syndrome (Chaps. 380 and 386). Stimulation tests 
generally are used to assess endocrine hypofunction. The ACTH stim-
ulation test, for example, is used to assess the adrenal gland response 
in  patients  with  suspected  adrenal  insufficiency.  Other  stimulation 
tests use hypothalamic-releasing factors such as corticotropin-releasing 
hormone (CRH) and growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) to 
evaluate pituitary hormone reserve (Chap. 380). Insulin-induced hypo-
glycemia evokes pituitary ACTH and GH responses. Stimulation tests 
based  on  reduction  or  inhibition  of  endogenous  hormones  are  now 
used infrequently. Examples include metyrapone inhibition of cortisol 
synthesis and clomiphene inhibition of estrogen feedback.

377 Mechanisms of  
Hormone Action
J. Larry Jameson

Hormones function to integrate physiologic systems in the body. The 
endocrine system, composed of various glands and the hormones they 
produce,  interacts  with  essentially  every  organ  to  regulate  growth, 
metabolism,  homeostasis,  and  reproduction.  Because  hormones  cir-
culate and act via receptors in target tissues, they serve to coordinate 
physiologic  responses  to  external  or  internal  cues.  For  example,  the 
light-dark  cycle,  sensed  through  the  visual  system,  modulates  hypo-
thalamic  corticotropin-releasing  hormone  (CRH),  which  increases 
pituitary  adrenocorticotropin  hormone  (ACTH)  production,  leading 
to  increased  adrenal  cortisol  production  before  the  time  of  waking

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismin the morning. Increased cortisol, in turn, circulates throughout the 
body, acting via the nuclear glucocorticoid receptor, to activate numer-
ous  genetic  programs  that  influence  metabolism,  the  cardiovascular 
system,  behavior,  and  the  immune  system.  This  chapter  provides  an 
overview of the different types of hormones and how they function at 
the cellular level to control myriad physiologic processes.

CLASSES OF HORMONES
Hormones can be divided into five major types: (1) amino acid deriv-
atives  such  as  dopamine,  catecholamine,  and  thyroid  hormone;  (2) 
small neuropeptides such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), 
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), somatostatin, and vasopressin;  
(3) large proteins such as insulin, luteinizing hormone (LH), and para-
thyroid  hormone  (PTH);  (4)  steroid  hormones  such  as  cortisol  and 
estrogen that are synthesized from cholesterol-based precursors; and (5) 
vitamin derivatives such as retinoids (vitamin A) and vitamin D. A vari-
ety of peptide growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), 
share actions with hormones but often act more locally. As a rule, amino 
acid derivatives and peptide hormones interact with cell-surface mem-
brane receptors. Steroids, thyroid hormones, vitamin D, and retinoids 
are lipid-soluble and bind to intracellular nuclear receptors, although 
many also interact with membrane receptors or intracellular signaling 
proteins as well.
 ■ HORMONE AND RECEPTOR FAMILIES
Hormones and receptors can be grouped into families, reflecting struc-
tural similarities and evolutionary origins (Table 377-1). The evolution 
of  these  families  generates  diverse  but  highly  selective  pathways  of 
hormone action. Recognition of these relationships has proven useful 
for extrapolating information gleaned from one hormone or receptor 
to other family members.

The glycoprotein hormone family, consisting of thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), LH, and human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), illustrates many features of evolution-
arily related hormones. The glycoprotein hormones are heterodimers 
that  share  the  α  subunit  in  common;  the  β  subunits  are  distinct  and

confer specific biologic actions. The overall three-dimensional archi-
tecture of the β subunits is similar, reflecting the locations of conserved 
disulfide  bonds  that  constrain  protein  conformation.  The  cloning  of 
the  β-subunit  genes  from  multiple  species  suggests  that  this  family 
arose from a common ancestral gene, probably by gene duplication and 
subsequent divergence to evolve new biologic functions.

As  hormone  families  enlarge  and  diverge,  their  receptors  have 
co-evolved to create new biologic functions. Related G protein–coupled 
receptors  (GPCRs),  for  example,  have  evolved  for  each  of  the  glyco-
protein  hormones.  These  receptors  are  also  structurally  similar,  and 
each is coupled predominantly to the Gsα signaling pathway. However, 
there is minimal overlap of hormone binding. For example, TSH binds 
with high specificity to the TSH receptor but interacts minimally with 
the LH or FSH receptors. Nonetheless, there can be subtle physiologic 
consequences  of  hormone  cross-reactivity  with  other  receptors.  Very 
high levels of hCG during pregnancy stimulate the TSH receptor and 
increase thyroid hormone levels, resulting via feedback inhibition in a 
compensatory decrease in TSH.

IGF1 and IGF2 have structural similarities that are most apparent 
when precursor forms of the proteins are compared. In contrast to the 
high degree of specificity seen with the glycoprotein hormones, there 
is moderate cross-talk among the members of the insulin/IGF family. 
High concentrations of an IGF2 precursor produced by certain tumors 
(e.g., sarcomas) can cause hypoglycemia, partly because of binding to 
insulin and IGF1 receptors (Chap. 410). High concentrations of insulin 
also bind to the IGF1 receptor, perhaps accounting for some of the clin-
ical manifestations seen in conditions with chronic hyperinsulinemia.
Another important example of receptor cross-talk is seen with PTH 
and parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP) (Chap. 410). PTH 
is produced by the parathyroid glands, whereas PTHrP is expressed at 
high levels during development and by a variety of tumors (Chap. 93). 
These  hormones  have  amino  acid  sequence  similarity,  particularly 
in their amino-terminal regions. Both hormones bind to the PTH1R 
receptor  that  is  expressed  in  bone  and  kidney.  Hypercalcemia  and 
hypophosphatemia therefore may result from excessive production of 
either hormone, making it difficult to distinguish hyperparathyroidism 
from hypercalcemia of malignancy solely on the basis of serum chem-
istries. However, sensitive and specific assays for PTH and PTHrP now 
allow these disorders to be distinguished more readily.

Based  on  their  specificities  for  DNA-binding  sites,  the  nuclear 
receptor  family  can  be  subdivided  into  type  1  receptors  (glucocorti-
coid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor, estrogen 
receptor, progesterone receptor) that bind steroids and type 2 receptors 
(thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptor, 
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor) that bind thyroid hormone, 
vitamin D, retinoic acid, or lipid derivatives, respectively. Certain func-
tional domains in nuclear receptors, such as the zinc finger DNA-bind-
ing  domains,  are  highly  conserved.  However,  selective  amino  acid 
differences within this domain confer DNA sequence specificity. The 
hormone-binding domains are more variable, providing great diversity 
in the array of small molecules that bind to different nuclear receptors. 
With few exceptions, hormone binding is highly specific for a single 
type of nuclear receptor. One exception involves the glucocorticoid and 
mineralocorticoid  receptors.  Because  the  mineralocorticoid  receptor 
also  binds  glucocorticoids  with  high  affinity,  an  enzyme  (11β-hy-
droxysteroid  dehydrogenase)  in  renal  tubular  cells  inactivates  gluco-
corticoids, allowing selective responses to mineralocorticoids such as 
aldosterone.  However,  when  very  high  glucocorticoid  concentrations 
occur,  as  in  Cushing’s  syndrome,  the  glucocorticoid  degradation 
pathway becomes saturated, allowing excessive cortisol levels to bind 
mineralocorticoid  receptors  leading  to  sodium  retention  and  potas-
sium wasting. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in ectopic 
ACTH  syndromes  (Chap.  386).  Another  example  of  relaxed  nuclear 
receptor specificity involves the estrogen receptor, which can bind an 
array of compounds, some of which have little apparent structural sim-
ilarity to the high-affinity ligand estradiol. This feature of the estrogen 
receptor  makes  it  susceptible  to  activation  by  “environmental  estro-
gens” such as resveratrol, octylphenol, and many other aromatic hydro-
carbons.  However,  this  lack  of  specificity  provides  an  opportunity  to

2886 synthesize  clinically  useful  antagonists  (e.g.,  tamoxifen)  and  selective 
estrogen response modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene. These com-
pounds  generate  distinct  estrogen  receptor  conformations  that  alter 
receptor interactions with components of the transcription machinery 
(see below), thereby conferring their unique actions.

 ■ HORMONE SYNTHESIS AND PROCESSING
The synthesis of peptide hormones and their receptors occurs through 
a  classic  pathway  of  gene  expression:  transcription  →  mRNA  →  
protein → posttranslational protein processing → intracellular sorting, 
followed by membrane integration or secretion.

Many  hormones  are  embedded  within  larger  precursor  polypep-
tides  that  are  proteolytically  processed  to  yield  the  biologically  active 
hormone. Examples include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) → ACTH; 
proglucagon → glucagon; proinsulin → insulin; and pro-PTH → PTH, 
among others. In many cases, such as POMC and proglucagon, these 
precursors generate multiple biologically active peptides. For example, 
proglucagon  generates  glucagon,  as  well  as  glucagon-like  peptide  1 
(GLP1), among other peptides. It is provocative that hormone precur-
sors  are  typically  inactive,  presumably  adding  an  additional  level  of 
control through peptide processing. Prohormone conversion occurs not 
only for peptide hormones but also for certain steroids (testosterone → 
dihydrotestosterone) and thyroid hormone (T4 → T3).

Peptide  precursor  processing  is  intimately  linked  to  intracellular 
sorting  pathways  that  transport  proteins  to  appropriate  vesicles  and 
enzymes,  resulting  in  specific  cleavage  steps,  followed  by  protein 
folding and translocation to secretory vesicles. Hormones destined for 
secretion  are  translocated  across  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  guided 
by  an  amino-terminal  signal  sequence  that  subsequently  is  cleaved. 
Cell-surface  receptors  are  inserted  into  the  membrane  via  short  seg-
ments of hydrophobic amino acids that remain embedded within the 
lipid bilayer. During translocation through the Golgi and endoplasmic 
reticulum,  hormones  and  receptors  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  post-
translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, 
which can alter protein conformation, modify circulating half-life, and 
alter biologic activity.

Synthesis of most steroid hormones is based on modifications of the 
precursor, cholesterol. Multiple regulated enzymatic steps are required 
for  the  synthesis  of  testosterone  (Chap.  391),  estradiol  (Chap.  392), 
cortisol (Chap. 386), and vitamin D (Chap. 409). This large number of 
synthetic steps predisposes to multiple genetic and acquired disorders 
of steroidogenesis.

Endocrine genes contain regulatory DNA elements similar to those 
found  in  many  other  genes,  but  their  exquisite  control  by  hormones 
reflects the presence of specific hormone response elements. For exam-
ple, the TSH genes are repressed directly by thyroid hormones acting 
through the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), a member of the nuclear 
receptor  family.  Steroidogenic  enzyme  gene  expression  requires  spe-
cific transcription factors, such as steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), acting 
in  conjunction  with  signals  transmitted  by  trophic  hormones  (e.g., 
ACTH  or  LH).  Once  activated,  SF1  functions  as  a  master  regulator, 
inducing  a  large  array  of  genes  required  for  steroidogenic  and  met-
abolic  pathways  required  for  steroid  synthesis.  For  some  hormones, 
substantial  regulation  occurs  at  the  level  of  translational  efficiency. 
Insulin biosynthesis, although it requires ongoing gene transcription, is 
regulated primarily at the translational and secretory levels in response 
to the levels of glucose or amino acids.

 ■ HORMONE SECRETION, TRANSPORT,  
AND DEGRADATION
The circulating level of a hormone is determined by its rate of secre-
tion and its half-life. After protein processing, peptide hormones (e.g., 
GnRH, insulin, growth hormone [GH]) are stored in secretory gran-
ules.  As  these  granules  mature,  they  are  poised  beneath  the  plasma 
membrane for imminent release into the circulation. In most instances, 
the stimulus for hormone secretion is a releasing factor or neural signal 
that induces rapid changes in voltage-gated channel activity or intracel-
lular calcium concentrations, leading to secretory granule fusion with 
the plasma membrane and release of its contents into the extracellular 

environment and bloodstream. Steroid hormones, in contrast, diffuse 
into the circulation as they are synthesized. Thus, their secretory rates 
are closely aligned with rates of synthesis. For example, ACTH and LH 
induce steroidogenesis by stimulating the activity of the steroidogenic 
acute regulatory (StAR) protein, which transports cholesterol into the 
mitochondrion,  along  with  other  rate-limiting  steps  (e.g.,  cholesterol 
side-chain cleavage enzyme, CYP11A1) in the steroidogenic pathway.

Hormone transport and degradation dictate the rapidity with which 
a hormonal signal decays. Some hormone signals are evanescent (e.g., 
somatostatin),  whereas  others  are  longer-lived  (e.g.,  TSH).  Because 
somatostatin  exerts  effects  in  virtually  every  tissue,  a  short  half-life 
allows its concentrations and actions to be controlled locally. Structural 
modifications that impair somatostatin degradation have been useful 
for  generating  long-acting  therapeutic  analogues  such  as  octreotide 
(Chap.  380).  In  contrast,  the  actions  of  TSH  are  highly  specific  for 
the thyroid gland. Its prolonged half-life generates relatively constant 
serum levels even though TSH is secreted in discrete pulses.

An understanding of circulating hormone half-life is important for 
achieving physiologic hormone replacement, as the frequency of dosing 
and the time required to reach steady state are intimately linked to rates 
of hormone decay. T4, for example, has a circulating half-life of 7 days. 
Consequently, >1 month is required to reach a new steady state, and 
single daily doses are sufficient to achieve constant hormone levels. T3, 
in contrast, has a half-life of 1 day. Its administration is associated with 
more dynamic serum levels, and it must be administered two to three 
times per day. Similarly, synthetic glucocorticoids vary widely in their 
half-lives; those with longer half-lives (e.g., dexamethasone) are asso-
ciated with greater suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) axis. Most protein hormones (e.g., ACTH, GH, prolactin [PRL], 
PTH, LH) have relatively short half-lives (<20 min), leading to sharp 
peaks of secretion and decay. The only accurate way to profile the pulse 
frequency  and  amplitude  of  these  hormones  is  to  measure  levels  in 
frequently sampled blood (every 10 min or less) over long durations 
(8–24 h). Because this is not practical in a clinical setting, an alternative 
strategy is to pool three to four blood samples drawn at about 30-min 
intervals or interpret the results in the context of a relatively wide nor-
mal range. Rapid hormone decay is useful in certain clinical settings. 
For example, the short half-life of PTH allows the use of intraoperative 
PTH levels to confirm successful removal of a parathyroid adenoma. 
This is particularly valuable diagnostically when there is a possibility 
of multicentric disease or parathyroid hyperplasia, as occurs with mul-
tiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) or renal insufficiency.

Many  hormones  circulate  in  association  with  serum-binding  pro-
teins.  Examples  include  (1)  T4  and  T3  binding  to  thyroxine-binding 
globulin (TBG), albumin, and thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA); 
(2) cortisol binding to cortisol-binding globulin (CBG); (3) androgen 
and  estrogen  binding  to  sex  hormone–binding  globulin  (SHBG);  (4) 
IGF1  and  IGF2  binding  to  multiple  IGF-binding  proteins  (IGFBPs); 
(5)  GH  interactions  with  GH-binding  protein  (GHBP),  a  circulating 
fragment  of  the  GH  receptor  extracellular  domain;  and  (6)  activin 
binding to follistatin. These interactions provide a hormone reservoir, 
prevent  otherwise  rapid  degradation  of  unbound  hormones,  restrict 
hormone access to certain sites (e.g., IGFBPs), and modulate the levels 
of unbound, or “free,” hormone concentrations. Although a variety of 
binding  protein  abnormalities  have  been  identified,  most  have  little 
clinical  consequence  aside  from  creating  diagnostic  problems.  For 
example,  TBG  deficiency  can  reduce  total  thyroid  hormone  levels 
greatly, but the free concentrations of T4 and T3 remain normal. Liver 
disease and certain medications can also influence binding protein lev-
els (e.g., estrogen increases TBG) or cause displacement of hormones 
from binding proteins (e.g., salsalate displaces T4 from TBG). In gen-
eral, only unbound hormone is available to interact with receptors and 
thus  elicit  a  biologic  response.  Short-term  perturbations  in  binding 
proteins change the free hormone concentration, which in turn induces 
compensatory  adaptations  through  feedback  loops.  SHBG  changes 
in women are an exception to this self-correcting mechanism. When 
SHBG decreases because of insulin resistance or androgen excess, the 
unbound testosterone concentration is increased, potentially contrib-
uting to hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolism(Chap.  394).  The  increased  unbound  testosterone 
level does not result in an adequate compensatory 
feedback  correction  because  estrogen,  not  testos-
terone, is the primary regulator of the reproductive 
axis.

An  additional  exception  to  the  unbound  hor-
mone hypothesis involves megalin, a member of the 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family that 
serves as an endocytotic receptor for thyroglobulin, 
carrier-bound vitamins A and D, and SHBG-bound 
androgens and estrogens. After internalization, the 
carrier  proteins  are  degraded  in  lysosomes  and 
release their bound ligands within the cells. Other 
membrane  transporters  have  also  been  identified 
for thyroid hormones.

Hormone  degradation  can  be  an  important 
mechanism  for  regulating  concentrations  locally. 
As noted above, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
inactivates  glucocorticoids  in  renal  tubular  cells, 
preventing  actions  through  the  mineralocorticoid 
receptor. Thyroid hormone deiodinases convert T4 
to  T3  and  can  inactivate  T3.  During  development, 
degradation  of  retinoic  acid  by  Cyp26b1  prevents 
primordial  germ  cells  in  the  male  from  entering 
meiosis, as occurs in the female ovary.
 ■ HORMONE ACTION THROUGH RECEPTORS
Receptors for hormones are divided into two major classes: membrane 
and nuclear. Membrane receptors primarily bind peptide hormones and 
catecholamines. Nuclear receptors bind small molecules that can diffuse 
across  the  cell  membrane,  such  as  steroids  and  vitamin  D.  Certain 
general  principles  apply  to  hormone-receptor  interactions  regardless 
of  the  class  of  receptor.  Hormones  bind  to  receptors  with  specificity 
and an affinity that generally coincides with the dynamic range of cir-
culating hormone concentrations. Low concentrations of free hormone 
(usually 10–12 to 10–9 M) rapidly associate and dissociate from receptors 
in  a  bimolecular  reaction  such  that  the  occupancy  of  the  receptor  at 
any  given  moment  is  a  function  of  hormone  concentration  and  the 
receptor’s  affinity  for  the  hormone.  Receptor  numbers  vary  greatly 
in  different  target  tissues,  providing  one  of  the  major  determinants 
of  tissue-specific  responses  to  circulating 
hormones.  For  example,  ACTH  receptors 
are located almost exclusively in the adrenal 
cortex, and LH receptors are found predom-
inantly  in  the  gonads.  In  contrast,  insulin 
and TRs are widely distributed, reflecting the 
need for metabolic responses in all tissues.

conformational  changes  in  these  domains,  transducing  structural 
changes  to  the  intracellular  domain,  which  is  a  docking  site  for  G 
proteins.

The large family of G proteins, so named because they bind guanine 
nucleotides  (guanosine  triphosphate  [GTP],  guanosine  diphosphate 
[GDP]),  provides  great  diversity  for  coupling  receptors  to  different 
signaling pathways. G proteins form a heterotrimeric complex that is 
composed  of  various  α  and  βγ  subunits  (Fig.  377-2).  The  α  subunit 
contains the guanine nucleotide–binding site and an intrinsic GTPase 
that  hydrolyzes  GTP  →  GDP.  The  βγ  subunits  are  tightly  associated 
and modulate the activity of the α subunit as well as mediating their 
own  effector  signaling  pathways.  G  protein  activity  is  regulated  by  a 
cycle that involves GTP hydrolysis and dynamic interactions between 
the α and βγ subunits. Hormone binding to the receptor induces GDP

 ■ MEMBRANE RECEPTORS
Membrane  receptors  for  hormones  can 
be  divided  into  several  major  groups: 
(1)  seven 
transmembrane  GPCRs,  (2) 
tyrosine  kinase  receptors,  (3)  cytokine 
receptors,  and  (4)  serine  kinase  receptors  
(Fig.  377-1).  The  seven  transmembrane 
GPCR  family  binds  a  huge  array  of  hor-
mones,  including  large  proteins  (e.g.,  LH, 
PTH),  small  peptides  (e.g.,  TRH,  soma-
tostatin),  catecholamines 
(epinephrine, 
dopamine),  and  even  minerals  (e.g.,  cal-
cium). The extracellular domains of GPCRs 
vary widely in size and are the major binding 
site  for  large  hormones.  The  transmem-
brane-spanning  regions  are  composed  of 
hydrophobic α-helical domains that traverse 
the  lipid  bilayer.  Like  some  channels,  these 
domains are thought to circularize and form 
a  hydrophobic  pocket  into  which  certain 
small  ligands  fit.  Hormone  binding  induces

FIGURE 377-2  G protein signaling. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal via the family of G proteins, so 
named because they bind guanylyl nucleotides. In the example shown, a GPCR bound to a ligand induces GDP 
dissociation, allowing Gsα to bind GTP and dissociate from the βγ complex. GTP-bound Gsα increases cAMP 
production by adenylyl cyclase and activates the protein kinase A pathway. Not shown are separate signaling 
pathways activated by the βγ complex. When GTP is converted to GDP by an intrinsic GTPase, the βγ subunits 
reassociate with GDP-bound Gsα and the complex returns to an inactive state. As noted in the text, mutations in 
Gsα that eliminate GTPase activity result in constitutive activation of receptor signaling pathways because GTP-
bound Gsα cannot be converted to its GDP-bound inactive state. cAMP, cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate;

dissociation, allowing Gα to bind GTP and dissociate from the βγ com-
plex. Under these conditions, the Gα subunit is activated and mediates 
signal transduction through various enzymes, such as adenylate cyclase 
and phospholipase C. GTP hydrolysis to GDP allows reassociation with 
the βγ subunits and restores the inactive state. G proteins interact with 
other cellular proteins, including kinases, channels, G protein–coupled 
receptor kinases (GRKs), and arrestins, that mediate signaling as well 
as receptor desensitization and recycling.

A variety of endocrinopathies result from mutations in GPCRs that 
alter their interactions with G proteins (Table 377-2). Loss-of-function 
mutations are generally recessive and inactivate the relevant hormone 
signaling  pathway.  Because  many  of  these  receptors  are  important 
for  development  as  well  as  signaling,  patient  presentations  resemble 
glandular failure syndromes (e.g., mutations in LH-R, FSH-R, TSH-R). 
Gain-of-function  (GOF)  mutations  are  more  complex.  Selected  GOF 
mutations  induce  conformational  changes  in  the  GPCR  that  mimic 
the activated state normally induced by hormone binding. These GOF 
mutations  result  in  a  constitutively  active  state  in  which  G  protein 
coupling stimulates cell signaling pathways, most commonly via cyclic 
adenosine  5′-monophosphate  (cAMP)  and  protein  kinase  A.  When 
mutations  occur  in  the  germline,  the  conditions  are  heritable  and

present in early life (e.g., LH-R, TSH-R). Sporadic, somatic mutations 
can also occur and result in clonal expansion of hyperfunctioning cells.
Mutations in the TSH-R illustrate the range of possible clinical con-
sequences of GPCR mutations. Recessive inactivating mutations in the 
TSH-R cause congenital hypothyroidism with thyroid gland hypoplasia 
and resistance to TSH. Clinically, the hormone profile resembles pri-
mary hypothyroidism with low T4 and high TSH. On the other hand, 
germline activating mutations cause congenital hyperthyroidism. The 
disorder is autosomal dominant because an activating mutation of one 
TSH-R allele is sufficient to induce cellular hyperfunction and disease. 
Because  the  TSH-R  is  activated  in  every  cell  of  the  thyroid,  there  is 
hyperplastic  growth  and  hyperfunction  that  resembles  the  pathology 
seen in Graves’ disease. This unusual disorder presents in infancy and 
must be distinguished from the more common clinical circumstance in 
which maternal antibodies in women with active or previously treated 
Graves’ disease cross the placenta and stimulate the thyroid gland of 
the fetus. If an activating TSH-R mutation occurs later in life, in the 
somatic  tissue,  there  is  clonal  expansion  of  the  thyrocyte  harboring 
the mutation, ultimately leading to an autonomous hyperfunctioning 
thyroid nodule. Of note, a similar condition can be caused by somatic 
mutations in Gsα. In this case, the Gsα GTPase is inactivated and GTP 
cannot be converted to GDP. Consequently, the Gsα signaling pathway 
in this particular cell is constitutively active, mimicking chronic TSH 
stimulation and again leading to clonal expansion and an autonomous 
hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule. About one-third of hyperfunction-
ing  “hot”  thyroid  nodules  harbor  sporadic  mutations  in  either  the 
TSH-R or Gsα (TSH-R mutations are more common).

Gsα mutations in tissues other than the thyroid can also cause endo-
crine  disease.  For  example,  Gsα  mutations  in  pituitary  somatotropes 
mimic activation of the growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) 
pathway and lead to GH-producing adenomas and acromegaly. Rarely, 
mutations  in  other  components  of  the  protein  kinase  A  pathway  in 
somatotropes  can  also  cause  GH-producing  adenomas.  Gsα  mutations 
that  occur  early  in  development  (typically  mosaic)  cause  McCune-Al-
bright  syndrome  (Chap.  412),  and  the  clinical  features  are  manifest 
because  the  activated  G  protein  pathway  mimics  the  actions  of  vari-
ous  hormones  (PTH,  melanocyte-stimulating  hormone  [MSH],  TSH, 
GHRH) in different tissues. Germline inactivating Gsα mutations cause a 
range of disorders that are transmitted and expressed in a complex man-
ner because the locus is imprinted (Chap. 410). These conditions include 
Albright’s  hereditary  osteodystrophy  (AHO),  pseudopseudohypopara-
thyroidism (PPHP), and pseudohypoparathyroidism types 1b, 1c, and 2.
The  tyrosine  kinase  receptors  transduce  signals  for  insulin  and 
a  variety  of  growth  factors,  such  as  IGF1,  epidermal  growth  factor 
(EGF), nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibrob-
last  growth  factors.  The  cysteine-rich  extracellular  domains  contain 
binding  sites  for  the  growth  factors.  After  ligand  binding,  this  class 
of  receptors  undergoes  autophosphorylation,  inducing  interactions 
with  intracellular  adaptor  proteins  such  as  Shc  and  insulin  receptor 
substrates  (IRS).  In  the  case  of  the  insulin  receptor,  multiple  kinases  
are activated, including the Raf-Ras-MAPK and the Akt/protein kinase 
B pathways. The tyrosine kinase receptors play a prominent role in cell 
growth and differentiation as well as in intermediary metabolism.

The GH and PRL receptors belong to the cytokine receptor family. 
Analogous  to  the  tyrosine  kinase  receptors,  ligand  binding  induces 
receptor  interaction  with  intracellular  kinases—the  Janus  kinases 
(JAKs),  which  phosphorylate  members  of  the  signal  transduction 
and  activators  of  transcription  (STAT)  family—as  well  as  with  other 
signaling pathways (Ras, PI3-K, MAPK). The activated STAT proteins 
translocate to the nucleus and stimulate expression of target genes.

The serine kinase receptors mediate the actions of activins, transform-
ing growth factor β, müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS; also known 
as  anti-müllerian  hormone  [AMH]),  and  bone  morphogenic  proteins 
(BMPs). This family of receptors (consisting of type I and II subunits) 
signals through proteins termed smads (fusion of terms for Caenorhab-
ditis  elegans  sma  +  mammalian  mad).  Like  the  STAT  proteins,  the 
smads serve a dual role of transducing the receptor signal and acting 
as transcription factors. The pleomorphic actions of these growth fac-
tors dictate that they act primarily in a local (paracrine or autocrine) 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   2888

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismmanner.  Binding  proteins  such  as  follistatin 
(which  binds  activin  and  other  members  of 
this  family)  function  to  inactivate  the  growth 
factors and restrict their distribution.

Disease-causing  mutations  also  occur  in 
each of these classes of receptors. For example, 
insulin  receptor  mutations  cause  an  extreme 
form of insulin resistance. GH receptor muta-
tions cause Laron-type dwarfism, characterized 
by  low  IGF1  and  high  GH.  AMH  receptor 
mutations cause persistent müllerian duct syn-
drome.  These  hormone  resistance  syndromes 
are  autosomal  recessive  and  relatively  uncom-
mon.  Unlike  the  GPCRs,  activating  mutations 
are  unusual,  although  they  do  occur  for  the 
RET  tyrosine  kinase  receptor,  which  causes 
the autosomal dominant disorder MEN type 2 
(MEN2) (Chap. 388).

 ■ NUCLEAR RECEPTORS
The  family  of  nuclear  receptors  has  grown  to 
nearly  100  members,  many  of  which  are  still 
classified  as  orphan  receptors  because  their 
ligands,  if  they  exist,  have  not  been  identified  
(Fig.  377-3).  Otherwise,  most  nuclear  recep-
tors are classified on the basis of their ligands. 
Although  all  nuclear  receptors  ultimately  act 
to increase or decrease gene transcription, some (e.g., glucocorticoid 
receptor) reside primarily in the cytoplasm, whereas others (e.g., TR) 
are  located  in  the  nucleus.  After  ligand  binding,  the  cytoplasmically 
localized  receptors  translocate  to  the  nucleus.  There  is  growing  evi-
dence  that  certain  nuclear  receptors  (e.g.,  glucocorticoid,  estrogen) 
can also act at the membrane or in the cytoplasm to activate or repress 
signal  transduction  pathways,  providing  a  mechanism  for  cross-talk 
between membrane and nuclear receptors.

The  structures  of  nuclear  receptors  have  been  studied  extensively, 
including by x-ray crystallography. The DNA-binding domain, consist-
ing of two zinc fingers, contacts specific DNA recognition sequences 
in target genes. Most nuclear receptors bind to DNA as dimers. Conse-
quently, each monomer recognizes an individual DNA motif, referred 
to as a “half-site.” The steroid receptors, including the glucocorticoid, 
estrogen,  progesterone,  and  androgen  receptors,  bind  to  DNA  as 
homodimers. Consistent with this twofold symmetry, their DNA rec-
ognition half-sites are palindromic. The thyroid, retinoid, peroxisome 
proliferator  activated,  and  vitamin  D  receptors  bind  to  DNA  pref-
erentially  as  heterodimers  in  combination  with  retinoid  X  receptors 
(RXRs). Their DNA half-sites are typically arranged as direct repeats.
The  carboxy-terminal  hormone-binding  domains  mediate  tran-
scriptional control. For type II receptors such as TR and retinoic acid 
receptor  (RAR),  co-repressor  proteins  bind  to  the  receptor  in  the 
absence  of  ligand  and  silence  gene  transcription.  Hormone  binding 
induces conformational changes, triggering the release of co-repressors 
and the recruitment of coactivators that stimulate transcription. Thus, 
these receptors are capable of mediating dynamic changes in the level 
of gene activity. Disease states can be associated with defective regula-
tion  of  these  events.  For  example,  in  promyelocytic  leukemia,  fusion 
of RARα to other nuclear proteins causes aberrant gene silencing that 
prevents normal cellular differentiation. Treatment with retinoic acid 
reverses this repression and allows cellular differentiation and apopto-
sis to occur. Most type 1 steroid receptors interact weakly with co-re-
pressors, but ligand binding still induces interactions with an array of 
coactivators. X-ray crystallography shows that various SERMs induce 
distinct estrogen receptor conformations. The tissue-specific responses 
caused  by  these  agents  in  breast,  bone,  and  uterus  appear  to  reflect 
distinct interactions with various coactivators. The receptor-coactivator 
complex stimulates gene transcription by several pathways, including 
(1)  recruitment  of  enzymes  (histone  acetyl  transferases)  that  modify 
chromatin  structure,  (2)  interactions  with  additional  transcription 
factors on the target gene, and (3) direct interactions with components

of  the  general  transcription  apparatus  to  enhance  the  rate  of  RNA 
polymerase  II–mediated  transcription.  Studies  of  nuclear  receptor– 
mediated transcription reveal relatively rapid (e.g., 30–60 min) cycling 
of transcription complexes on any specific target gene.

Nuclear receptor mutations are an important cause of endocrine dis-
ease. Androgen receptor mutations cause androgen insensitivity syn-
drome (AIS) (Chap. 390). Because the androgen receptor is located on 
the X chromosome, phenotypic expression is more commonly manifest 
than with other nuclear receptor disorders. Affected individuals with 
AIS  are  XY  phenotypic  females  with  retained  testes  and  male-range 
testosterone  levels.  Tissue  insensitivity  to  androgens  varies  based  on 
the severity of the mutation. Müllerian structures are absent because 
Sertoli  cells  of  the  testis  produce  AMH  during  development.  Female 
carriers  of  androgen  receptor  mutations  are  phenotypically  normal. 
Recessive  mutations  of  the  estrogen,  glucocorticoid,  and  vitamin  D 
receptors occur but are rare.

Thyroid  hormone  receptor  β  (TRβ)  mutations  have  an  unusual 
pathophysiology.  They  are  autosomal  dominant  and  function  via  a 
“dominant negative” mechanism to cause resistance to thyroid hormone 
(RTH) (Chap. 382). The mutations occur in selected regions of the TRβ 
hormone-binding domain and preserve the ability of the mutant recep-
tor to heterodimerize with RXR, interact with co-repressors, and bind 
to DNA regulatory sites. The mutant receptors function as antagonists 
of receptors from the normal copy of the TRβ gene. Affected patients 
have  high  T4  and  T3  and  inappropriately  elevated  (unsuppressed) 
TSH,  reflecting  impaired  feedback  regulation  of  the  hypothalamic-
pituitary-thyroid axis. Organ systems are variably resistant to thyroid 
hormones based on the relative expression of TRβ and TRα. Mutations 
in the genes encoding TRα and PPARγ can also cause disease by func-
tioning in an analogous dominant negative manner.

FUNCTIONS OF HORMONES
The  functions  of  individual  hormones  are  described  in  detail  in 
subsequent  chapters.  Nevertheless,  it  is  useful  to  illustrate  how  most 
biologic responses require the integration of several different hormone 
pathways. The physiologic functions of hormones can be divided into 
three general types: (1) growth and differentiation, (2) maintenance of 
homeostasis, and (3) reproduction.

 ■ GROWTH
Multiple hormones and nutritional factors mediate the complex phe-
nomenon of growth (Chap. 378). Short stature may be caused by GH

2890 deficiency, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, precocious puberty, 
malnutrition,  chronic  illness,  or  genetic  abnormalities  that  affect  the 
epiphyseal  growth  plates  (e.g.,  FGFR3  and  SHOX  mutations).  Many 
factors  (GH,  IGF1,  thyroid  hormones)  stimulate  growth,  whereas 
others  (sex  steroids)  lead  to  epiphyseal  closure.  Understanding  these 
hormonal interactions is important in the diagnosis and management 
of growth disorders. For example, delaying exposure to high levels of 
sex steroids may enhance the efficacy of GH treatment.

 ■ MAINTENANCE OF HOMEOSTASIS
Although virtually all hormones affect homeostasis, the most impor-
tant among them are the following:

1.  Thyroid  hormone—controls  ~25%  of  basal  metabolism  in  most 

tissues.

2.  Cortisol—exerts a permissive action for many hormones in addition 

to its own direct effects.

3.  PTH—regulates calcium and phosphorus levels.
4.  Vasopressin—regulates  serum  osmolality  by  controlling  renal 

free-water clearance.

5.  Mineralocorticoids—control vascular volume and serum electrolyte 

(Na+, K+) concentrations.

6.  Insulin—maintains euglycemia in the fed and fasted states.

The defense against hypoglycemia is an impressive example of inte-
grated  hormone  action  (Chap.  406).  In  response  to  the  fasting  state 
and  falling  blood  glucose,  insulin  secretion  is  suppressed,  resulting 
in  decreased  glucose  uptake  and  enhanced  glycogenolysis,  lipolysis, 
proteolysis, and gluconeogenesis to mobilize fuel sources. If hypogly-
cemia develops (usually from insulin administration or sulfonylureas), 
an  orchestrated  counterregulatory  response  occurs—glucagon  and 
epinephrine  rapidly  stimulate  glycogenolysis  and  gluconeogenesis, 
whereas GH and cortisol act over several hours to raise glucose levels 
and antagonize insulin action.

Although free-water clearance is controlled primarily by vasopressin, 
cortisol and thyroid hormone are also important for facilitating renal 
tubular  responses  to  vasopressin  (Chap.  381).  PTH  and  vitamin  D 
function in an interdependent manner to control calcium metabolism 
(Chap. 409). PTH stimulates renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D,  
which  increases  calcium  absorption  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract  and 
enhances PTH action in bone. Increased calcium, along with vitamin D, 
feeds back to suppress PTH, thus maintaining calcium balance.

Depending on the severity of a specific stress and whether it is acute 
or  chronic,  multiple  endocrine  and  cytokine  pathways  are  activated 
to  mount  an  appropriate  physiologic  response.  In  severe  acute  stress 
such  as  trauma  or  shock,  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  is  activated, 
and  catecholamines  are  released,  leading  to  increased  cardiac  output 
and  a  primed  musculoskeletal  system.  Catecholamines  also  increase 
mean blood pressure and stimulate glucose production. Multiple stress- 
induced  pathways  converge  on  the  hypothalamus,  stimulating  several 
hormones, including vasopressin and CRH. These hormones, in addition 
to cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin [IL] 2, IL-6), increase 
ACTH and GH production. ACTH stimulates the adrenal gland, increas-
ing cortisol, which in turn helps sustain blood pressure and dampen the 
inflammatory response. Increased vasopressin acts to conserve free water.

 ■ REPRODUCTION
The  stages  of  reproduction  include  (1)  sex  determination  during 
fetal development (Chap. 390); (2) sexual maturation during puberty 
(Chaps. 391 and 392); (3) conception, pregnancy, lactation, and child 
rearing  (Chap.  392);  and  (4)  cessation  of  reproductive  capability  at 
menopause (Chap. 395). Each of these stages involves an orchestrated 
interplay of multiple hormones, a phenomenon well illustrated by the 
dynamic hormonal changes that occur during each 28-day menstrual 
cycle. In the early follicular phase, pulsatile secretion of LH and FSH 
stimulates  the  progressive  maturation  of  the  ovarian  follicle.  This 
results in gradually increasing estrogen and progesterone levels, lead-
ing to enhanced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH, which, when combined 
with accelerated GnRH secretion, triggers the LH surge and rupture of 
the mature follicle. Inhibin, a protein produced by the granulosa cells, 

enhances follicular growth and feeds back to the pituitary to selectively 
suppress FSH without affecting LH. Growth factors such as EGF and 
IGF1  modulate  follicular  responsiveness  to  gonadotropins.  Vascular 
endothelial  growth  factor  and  prostaglandins  play  a  role  in  follicle 
vascularization and rupture.

During pregnancy, the increased production of PRL, in combination 
with  placentally  derived  steroids  (e.g.,  estrogen  and  progesterone), 
prepares  the  breast  for  lactation.  Estrogens  induce  the  production  of 
progesterone receptors, allowing for increased responsiveness to pro-
gesterone. In addition to these and other hormones involved in lacta-
tion, the nervous system and oxytocin mediate the suckling response 
and milk release.

HORMONAL FEEDBACK REGULATORY 
SYSTEMS
Feedback control, both negative and positive, is a fundamental feature 
of  endocrine  systems.  Each  of  the  major  hypothalamic-pituitary- 
hormone axes is governed by negative feedback, a process that main-
tains  hormone  levels  within  a  relatively  narrow  range  (Chap.  378). 
Examples of hypothalamic-pituitary negative feedback include (1) thy-
roid hormones on the TRH-TSH axis, (2) cortisol on the CRH-ACTH 
axis,  (3)  gonadal  steroids  on  the  GnRH-LH/FSH  axis,  and  (4)  IGF1 
on  the  GHRH-GH  axis  (Fig.  377-4).  These  regulatory  loops  include 
both positive (e.g., TRH, TSH) and negative (e.g., T4, T3) components, 
allowing for exquisite control of hormone levels. As an example, a small 
reduction  of  thyroid  hormone  triggers  a  rapid  increase  of  TRH  and 
TSH  secretion,  resulting  in  thyroid  gland  stimulation  and  increased 
thyroid hormone production. When thyroid hormone reaches a nor-
mal level, it feeds back to suppress TRH and TSH, and a new steady 
state is attained. Feedback regulation also occurs for endocrine systems 
that  do  not  involve  the  pituitary  gland,  such  as  calcium  feedback  on 
PTH,  glucose  inhibition  of  insulin  secretion,  and  leptin  feedback  on 
the hypothalamus. An understanding of feedback regulation provides 
important insights into endocrine testing paradigms (see below).

Positive feedback control also occurs but is not well understood. The 
primary example is estrogen-mediated stimulation of the midcycle LH 
surge.  Although  chronic  low  levels  of  estrogen  are  inhibitory,  gradu-
ally rising estrogen levels stimulate LH secretion. This effect, which is

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismillustrative of an endocrine rhythm (see below), involves activation of 
the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator. In addition, estrogen-primed 
gonadotropes are extraordinarily sensitive to GnRH, leading to ampli-
fication of LH release.

 ■ PARACRINE AND AUTOCRINE CONTROL
The previously mentioned examples of feedback control involve classic 
endocrine pathways in which hormones are released by one gland and 
act on a distant target gland. However, local regulatory systems, often 
involving growth factors, are increasingly recognized. Paracrine regula-
tion refers to factors released by one cell that act on an adjacent cell in 
the same tissue. For example, somatostatin secretion by pancreatic islet 
δ cells inhibits insulin secretion from nearby β cells. Autocrine regula-
tion describes the action of a factor on the same cell from which it is 
produced. IGF1 acts on many cells that produce it, including chondro-
cytes, breast epithelium, and gonadal cells. Unlike endocrine actions, 
paracrine and autocrine control are difficult to document because local 
growth factor concentrations cannot be measured readily.

Anatomic relationships of glandular systems also greatly influence 
hormonal  exposure:  the  physical  organization  of  islet  cells  enhances 
their  intercellular  communication;  the  portal  vasculature  of  the  
hypothalamic-pituitary system exposes the pituitary to high concentra-
tions of hypothalamic releasing factors; testicular seminiferous tubules 
gain exposure to high testosterone levels produced by the interdigitated 
Leydig cells; the pancreas receives nutrient information and local expo-
sure  to  peptide  hormones  (incretins)  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract; 
and the liver is the proximal target of insulin action because of portal 
drainage from the pancreas.

 ■ HORMONAL RHYTHMS
The  feedback  regulatory  systems  described  above  are  superimposed 
on hormonal rhythms that are used for adaptation to the environment. 
Seasonal  changes,  the  daily  occurrence  of  the  light-dark  cycle,  sleep, 
meals, and stress are examples of the many environmental events that 
affect hormonal rhythms. The menstrual cycle is repeated on average 
every  28  days,  reflecting  the  time  required  to  follicular  maturation, 
ovulation, and potential implantation (Chap. 392). Essentially all pitu-
itary hormone rhythms are entrained to sleep and to the circadian cycle, 
generating reproducible patterns that are repeated approximately every 
24 h. The HPA axis, for example, exhibits characteristic peaks of ACTH 
and cortisol production in the early morning, with a nadir during the 
night. Recognition of these rhythms is important for endocrine testing 
and  treatment.  Patients  with  Cushing’s  syndrome  characteristically 
exhibit increased midnight cortisol levels compared with normal indi-
viduals (Chap. 386). In contrast, morning cortisol levels are similar in 
these groups, as cortisol is normally high at this time of day in normal 
individuals. The HPA axis is more susceptible to suppression by glu-
cocorticoids administered at night as they blunt the early-morning rise 
of ACTH. Understanding these rhythms allows glucocorticoid replace-
ment  that  mimics  diurnal  production  by  administering  larger  doses 
in  the  morning  than  in  the  afternoon.  Disrupted  sleep  rhythms  can 
alter hormonal regulation. For example, sleep deprivation causes mild 
insulin  resistance,  food  craving,  and  hypertension,  which  are  revers-
ible, at least in the short term. Emerging evidence indicates that circa-
dian clock pathways not only regulate sleep-wake cycles but also play 
important roles in virtually every cell type. For example, tissue-specific 
deletion of clock genes alters rhythms and levels of gene expression, as 
well as metabolic responses in liver, adipose, and other tissues.

Other endocrine rhythms occur on a more rapid time scale. Many 
peptide hormones are secreted in discrete bursts every few hours. LH 
and FSH secretion are exquisitely sensitive to GnRH pulse frequency. 
Intermittent  pulses  of  GnRH  are  required  to  maintain  pituitary 
sensitivity,  whereas  continuous  exposure  to  GnRH  causes  pituitary 
gonadotrope  desensitization.  This  feature  of  the  hypothalamic- 
pituitary-gonadotrope axis forms the basis for using long-acting GnRH 
agonists to treat central precocious puberty or to decrease testosterone 
levels in the management of prostate cancer. It is important to be aware 
of the pulsatile nature of hormone secretion and the rhythmic patterns 
of  hormone  production  in  relating  serum  hormone  measurements 

to normal values. For some hormones, integrated markers have been 
developed  to  circumvent  hormonal  fluctuations.  Examples  include 
24-h urine collections for cortisol, the measurement of IGF1 as a bio-
logic marker of GH action, and HbA1c as an index of long-term (weeks 
to months) blood glucose control.

Often, one must interpret endocrine data only in the context of other 
hormones. For example, PTH levels typically are assessed in combina-
tion with serum calcium concentrations. A high serum calcium level 
in association with elevated PTH is suggestive of hyperparathyroidism, 
whereas  a  suppressed  PTH  in  the  setting  of  hypercalcemia  is  more 
likely to be caused by hypercalcemia of malignancy, or other causes of 
hypercalcemia. Similarly, when T4 and T3 concentrations are low, TSH 
should be elevated, reflecting reduced feedback inhibition. When this 
is not the case, it is important to consider secondary hypothyroidism, 
which is caused by a defect at the level of the pituitary.

378 Physiology of Anterior 
Pituitary Hormones
Shlomo Melmed, J. Larry Jameson

The anterior pituitary often is referred to as the “master gland” because, 
together with the hypothalamus, it orchestrates the complex regulatory 
functions of many other endocrine glands. The anterior pituitary gland 
produces six major hormones: (1) prolactin (PRL), (2) growth hormone 
(GH),  (3)  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH),  (4)  luteinizing  hor-
mone  (LH),  (5)  follicle-stimulating  hormone  (FSH),  and  (6)  thyroid-
stimulating  hormone  (TSH)  (Table  378-1).  Pituitary  hormones  are 
secreted in a pulsatile manner, reflecting regulation by an array of spe-
cific hypothalamic releasing factors. Each of these pituitary hormones 
elicits  specific  trophic  responses  in  peripheral  target  tissues  including 
the adrenal, thyroid, and gonads, as well as tissues involved in metabo-
lism (e.g., liver, breast, bone). Elicited hormonal products of peripheral 
glands, in turn, exert feedback control at the level of the hypothalamus 
and  pituitary  to  modulate  pituitary  function  (Fig.  378-1).  Pituitary 
tumors  cause  characteristic  hormone  excess  syndromes.  Hormone 
deficiency  may  be  inherited  or  acquired.  Fortunately,  there  are  effi-
cacious treatments for many pituitary hormone excess and deficiency 
syndromes. Nonetheless, these diagnoses are often elusive; this empha-
sizes the importance of recognizing subtle clinical manifestations and 
performing  the  correct  laboratory  diagnostic  tests.  For  discussion 
of  disorders  of  the  posterior  pituitary  or  neurohypophysis,  see  
Chap. 381.

ANATOMY AND DEVELOPMENT
 ■ ANATOMY
The  pituitary  gland  weighs  ~600  mg  and  is  located  within  the  sella 
turcica ventral to the diaphragma sella; it consists of anatomically and 
functionally  distinct  anterior  and  posterior  lobes.  The  bony  sella  is

contiguous to vascular and neurologic structures, including the cavern-
ous sinuses, cranial nerves, and optic chiasm. Thus, expanding intrasel-
lar  pathologic  processes  may  have  significant  central  mass  effects  in 
addition to their endocrinologic impact.

Hypothalamic neural cells synthesize specific releasing and inhibiting 
hormones that are secreted directly into the portal vessels of the pituitary 
stalk. Blood supply of the pituitary gland comes from the superior and 
inferior hypophyseal arteries (Fig. 378-2). The hypothalamic-pituitary 
portal plexus provides the major blood source for the anterior pituitary, 
allowing reliable transmission of hypothalamic peptide pulses without 
significant systemic dilution; consequently, anterior pituitary cells are 
exposed to specific releasing or inhibiting factors and in turn release 
their respective hormones as discrete pulses into the systemic circula-
tion (Fig. 378-3).

The posterior pituitary is supplied by the inferior hypophyseal arter-
ies. In contrast to the anterior pituitary, the posterior lobe is directly 
innervated  by  hypothalamic  neurons  (supraopticohypophyseal  and 
tuberohypophyseal  nerve  tracts)  via  the  pituitary  stalk  (Chap.  381). 
Thus, posterior pituitary production of vasopressin (antidiuretic hor-
mone [ADH]) and oxytocin is particularly sensitive to neuronal dam-
age by lesions that affect the pituitary stalk or hypothalamus.
 ■ PITUITARY DEVELOPMENT
The embryonic differentiation and maturation of anterior pituitary cells 
have been elucidated in considerable detail. Pituitary development from 
Rathke’s  pouch  involves  a  complex  interplay  of  lineage-specific  tran-
scription  factors  expressed  in  pluripotent  Sox2-expressing  precursor 
cells  and  gradients  of  locally  produced  growth  factors  (Table  378-1). 
The transcription factor Prop-1 induces pituitary development of Pit-1- 
specific lineages as well as gonadotropes. The transcription factor Pit-1 
determines cell-specific expression of GH, PRL, and TSH in somato-
tropes, lactotropes, and thyrotropes. Expression of high levels of estro-
gen receptors in cells that contain Pit-1 favors PRL expression, whereas 
thyrotrope  embryonic  factor  (TEF)  induces  TSH  expression.  Pit-1 
binds  to  GH,  PRL,  and  TSH  gene  regulatory  elements,  providing  a 
mechanism for determining specific pituitary hormone phenotypic sta-
bility. Gonadotrope cell development is further defined by the cell-spe-
cific  expression  of  the  nuclear  receptors  steroidogenic  factor  (SF-1) 
and  dosage-sensitive  sex  reversal,  adrenal  hypoplasia  critical  region, 
on  chromosome  X,  gene  1  (DAX-1).  Development  of  corticotrope 
cells, which express the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, requires 
the T-Pit transcription factor. Abnormalities of pituitary development 
can be caused by inherited mutations of developmental transcription 

factors  including  Pit-1,  Prop-1,  SF-1,  DAX-1,  and  T-Pit,  resulting  in 
selective or combined pituitary hormone deficit syndromes.

ANTERIOR PITUITARY HORMONES
Each  anterior  pituitary  hormone  is  under  unique  control,  and 
each  exhibits  highly  specific  normal  and  dysregulated  secretory 
characteristics.
 ■ PROLACTIN
Synthesis  PRL  consists  of  198  amino  acids  and  has  a  molecular 
mass of 21,500 kDa; it is weakly homologous to GH and human pla-
cental  lactogen  (hPL),  reflecting  the  duplication  and  divergence  of  a 
common  GH-PRL-hPL  precursor  gene.  PRL  is  synthesized  in  lacto-
tropes, which constitute ~20% of anterior pituitary cells. Lactotropes 
and somatotropes are derived from a common precursor cell that may 
give rise to a tumor that secretes both PRL and GH. Marked lactotrope 
cell hyperplasia develops during pregnancy and the first few months of 
lactation. These transient functional changes in the lactotrope popula-
tion are induced by estrogen to increase PRL production.

Secretion  Normal  adult  serum  PRL  levels  are  about  10–25  μg/L 
in  women  and  10–20  μg/L  in  men.  PRL  secretion  is  pulsatile,  with 
the  highest  secretory  peaks  occurring  during  non–rapid  eye  move-
ment (non-REM) sleep. Peak serum PRL levels (up to 30 μg/L) occur 
between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m. The circulating half-life of PRL is ~50 min.
PRL is unique among the pituitary hormones in that the predom-
inant  hypothalamic  control  mechanism  is  inhibitory,  reflecting  tonic 
dopamine-mediated suppression of PRL release. This regulatory path-
way accounts for the spontaneous PRL hypersecretion that occurs with 
pituitary  stalk  section,  often  a  consequence  of  head  trauma  or  com-
pressive mass lesions at the skull base. Pituitary dopamine type 2 (D2) 
receptors mediate inhibition of PRL synthesis and secretion. Targeted 
disruption (gene knockout) of the murine D2 receptor in mice results in 
hyperprolactinemia  and  lactotrope  proliferation.  As  discussed  below, 
dopamine agonists play a central role in the management of hyperpro-
lactinemic disorders.

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (pyro Glu-His-Pro-NH2) is a 
hypothalamic tripeptide that elicits PRL release within 15–30 min after 
intravenous injection. TRH primarily regulates TSH, and the physio-
logic relevance of TRH for PRL regulation is unclear (Chap. 382).

Serum  PRL  levels  rise  transiently  after  exercise,  meals,  sexual 
intercourse, minor surgical procedures, general anesthesia, chest wall 
injury,  acute  myocardial  infarction,  and  other  forms  of  acute  stress.

IGF-1

PRL  levels  increase  markedly  (about  tenfold)  during  pregnancy  and 
decline rapidly within 2 weeks of parturition. If breast-feeding is ini-
tiated, basal PRL levels remain elevated; suckling stimulates transient 
reflex increases in PRL levels that last for ~30–45 min. Breast suckling 
activates  afferent  neural  pathways  in  the  hypothalamus  that  induce 
PRL  release.  With  time,  suckling-induced  responses  diminish  and 
interfeeding PRL levels return to normal.

Action  The PRL receptor is a member of the type I cytokine recep-
tor family that also includes GH and interleukin (IL) 6 receptors. Lig-
and binding induces receptor dimerization and intracellular signaling 
by  Janus  kinase  (JAK),  which  stimulates  translocation  of  the  signal 
transduction and activators of transcription (STAT) family to activate 
target genes. Mutations of the PRL receptor result in PRL insensitivity, 
hyperprolactinemia,  and  oligomenorrhea.  When  homozygous,  PRL 
receptor  mutations  cause  agalactia,  demonstrating  that  PRL  action 
is  necessary  for  lactation.  In  the  breast,  the  lobuloalveolar  epithe-
lium  proliferates  in  response  to  PRL,  placental  lactogens,  estrogen,

progesterone, and local paracrine growth factors, including insulin-like 
growth factor 1 (IGF-1).

PRL  acts  to  induce  and  maintain  lactation  and  to  suppress  both 
reproductive  function  and  sexual  drive.  These  functions  are  geared 
toward  ensuring  that  maternal  lactation  is  sustained  and  not  inter-
rupted  by  pregnancy.  PRL  inhibits  reproductive  function  by  sup-
pressing hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and 
pituitary  gonadotropin  secretion  and  by  impairing  gonadal  steroi-
dogenesis  in  both  women  and  men.  In  the  ovary,  PRL  blocks  follic-
ulogenesis  and  inhibits  granulosa  cell  aromatase  activity,  leading  to 
hypoestrogenism and anovulation. PRL also has a luteolytic effect, gen-
erating a shortened, or inadequate, luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. 
In  men,  attenuated  LH  secretion  leads  to  low  testosterone  levels  and 
decreased  spermatogenesis.  These  hormonal  changes  decrease  libido 
and reduce fertility in patients with hyperprolactinemia.

2894 anterior  pituitary  cell  population.  Mammosomatotrope  cells,  which 
coexpress PRL with GH, can be identified by using double immunos-
taining  techniques.  Somatotrope  development  and  GH  transcription 
are  determined  by  expression  of  the  cell-specific  Pit-1  nuclear  tran-
scription  factor.  Five  distinct  genes  encode  GH  and  related  proteins. 
The  pituitary  GH  gene  (hGH-N)  produces  two  alternatively  spliced 
products  that  give  rise  to  22-kDa  GH  (191  amino  acids)  and  a  less 
abundant 20-kDa GH molecule with similar biologic activity. Placen-
tal syncytiotrophoblast cells express a GH variant (hGH-V) gene; the 
related hormone human chorionic somatotropin (HCS) is expressed by 
distinct members of the gene cluster.

Secretion  GH secretion is controlled by complex hypothalamic and 
peripheral factors. GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a 44-amino-acid 
hypothalamic peptide that stimulates GH synthesis and release. Ghre-
lin,  an  octanoylated  gastric-derived  peptide,  and  synthetic  agonists 
of  the  GHS-R  induce  GHRH  and  also  directly  stimulate  GH  release. 
Somatostatin (somatotropin-release inhibiting factor [SRIF]) is synthe-
sized in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus and inhibits GH 
secretion.  GHRH  is  secreted  in  discrete  spikes  that  elicit  GH  pulses, 
whereas SRIF sets basal GH secretory tone. SRIF also is expressed in 
many extrahypothalamic tissues, including the central nervous system 
(CNS), gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas, where it also acts to inhibit 
islet  hormone  secretion.  IGF-1,  the  peripheral  target  hormone  for 
GH, feeds back to inhibit GH; estrogen induces GH, whereas chronic 
glucocorticoid excess suppresses GH release, leading to growth delay 
in children.

Surface  receptors  on  the  somatotrope  regulate  GH  synthesis  and 
secretion.  The  GHRH  receptor  is  a  G  protein–coupled  receptor 
(GPCR)  that  signals  through  the  intracellular  cyclic  AMP  pathway 
to stimulate somatotrope cell proliferation as well as GH production. 
Inactivating mutations of the GHRH receptor cause profound dwarf-
ism.  A  distinct  surface  receptor  for  ghrelin,  the  gastric-derived  GH 
secretagogue,  is  expressed  in  both  the  hypothalamus  and  pituitary. 
Somatostatin binds to five distinct receptor subtypes (SST1 to SST5); 
SST2 and SST5 subtypes preferentially suppress GH (and TSH) secre-
tion, while SST5 predominantly signals to suppress ACTH secretion.

GH  secretion  is  pulsatile,  with  highest  peak  levels  occurring  at 
night, generally correlating with sleep onset. GH secretory rates decline 
markedly with age so that hormone levels in middle age are ~15% of 
pubertal levels. These changes are paralleled by an age-related decline 
in lean muscle mass. GH secretion is also reduced in obese individuals, 
although IGF-1 levels may not be suppressed, suggesting a change in 
the setpoint for feedback control. Elevated GH levels occur within an 
hour of deep sleep onset as well as after exercise, physical stress, and 
trauma  and  during  sepsis.  Integrated  24-h  GH  secretion  is  higher  in 
women and is also enhanced by estrogen replacement, likely reflective 
of increased peripheral GH resistance. Using standard assays, random 
GH  measurements  are  undetectable  in  ~50%  of  daytime  samples 
obtained from healthy subjects and are also undetectable (<1 μg/L) in 
most  obese  and  elderly  subjects.  Thus,  single  random  GH  measure-
ments do not distinguish patients with adult GH deficiency from those 
with GH levels in the normal range.

GH secretion is profoundly influenced by nutritional factors. Using 
ultrasensitive  GH  assays  with  a  sensitivity  of  0.002  μg/L,  a  glucose 
load suppresses GH to <0.7 μg/L in women and to <0.07 μg/L in men. 
Increased GH pulse frequency and peak amplitudes occur with chronic 
malnutrition  or  prolonged  fasting.  GH  is  stimulated  by  oral  ghrelin 
receptor agonists, intravenous l-arginine, dopamine, and apomorphine 
(a  dopamine  receptor  agonist),  as  well  as  by  α-adrenergic  pathways. 
β-Adrenergic  blockade  induces  basal  GH  and  enhances  GHRH-  and 
insulin-evoked GH release.

Action  The  pattern  of  GH  secretion  may  affect  tissue  responses. 
The  higher  GH  pulsatility  observed  in  men  compared  with  the  rela-
tively continuous basal GH secretion in women may be an important 
biologic  determinant  of  linear  growth  patterns  and  liver  enzyme 
induction.

The 70-kDa peripheral GH receptor protein has structural homology 
with the cytokine/hematopoietic superfamily. A fragment of the receptor 
extracellular  domain  generates  a  soluble  GH  binding  protein  (GHBP) 
that binds to circulating GH. The liver and cartilage express the greatest 
number  of  GH  receptors.  GH  binding  to  preformed  receptor  dimers 
is  followed  by  internal  rotation  and  subsequent  signaling  through 
the  JAK/STAT  pathway.  Activated  STAT  proteins  translocate  to  the 
nucleus, where they modulate expression of GH-regulated target genes. 
GH analogues that bind to the receptor but are incapable of mediating 
receptor signaling are potent antagonists of GH action. A GH receptor 
antagonist (pegvisomant) is approved for treatment of acromegaly.

GH  induces  protein  synthesis  and  nitrogen  retention  and  also 
impairs  glucose  tolerance  by  antagonizing  insulin  action.  GH  also 
stimulates  lipolysis,  leading  to  increased  circulating  fatty  acid  levels, 
reduced omental fat mass, and enhanced lean body mass. GH promotes 
sodium,  potassium,  and  water  retention  and  elevates  serum  levels  of 
inorganic phosphate. Linear bone growth occurs as a result of complex 
hormonal  and  growth  factor  actions,  including  those  of  IGF-1.  GH 
stimulates epiphyseal prechondrocyte differentiation. These precursor 
cells produce IGF-1 locally, and their proliferation is also responsive to 
the growth factor.

Insulin-Like Growth Factors  Although GH exerts direct effects 
in target tissues, many of its physiologic effects are mediated indirectly 
through  IGF-1,  a  potent  growth  and  differentiation  factor.  The  liver 
is the major source of circulating IGF-1. In peripheral tissues, IGF-1 
also exerts local paracrine actions that appear to be both dependent on 
and independent of GH. Thus, GH administration induces circulating 
IGF-1 as well as stimulating local IGF-1 production in multiple tissues.
Both  IGF-1  and  IGF-2  are  bound  to  high-affinity  circulating 
IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) that regulate IGF availability and bio-
activity. Levels of IGFBP3 are GH dependent, and it serves as the major 
carrier protein for circulating IGF-1. GH deficiency and malnutrition 
usually  are  associated  with  low  IGFBP3  levels.  IGFBP1  and  IGFBP2 
regulate local tissue IGF action but do not bind appreciable amounts 
of circulating IGF-1.

Serum  IGF-1  concentrations  are  profoundly  affected  by  physio-
logic  factors.  Levels  increase  during  puberty,  peak  at  16  years,  and 
subsequently  decline  by  >80%  during  the  aging  process.  IGF-1  con-
centrations  are  higher  in  women  than  in  men.  Because  GH  is  the 
major  determinant  of  hepatic  IGF-1  synthesis,  abnormalities  of  GH 
synthesis or action (including pituitary failure, GHRH receptor defect, 
GH  receptor  defect,  or  pharmacologic  GH  receptor  blockade)  lead 
to  reduced  IGF-1  levels.  Hypocaloric  states  are  associated  with  GH 
resistance; IGF-1 levels are therefore low with cachexia, malnutrition, 
and sepsis. In acromegaly, IGF-1 levels are invariably high and reflect a 
log-linear relationship with circulating GH concentrations.
IGF-1  PHYSIOLOGY  Injected  IGF-1  (100  μg/kg)  induces  hypoglyce-
mia, and lower doses improve insulin sensitivity in patients with severe 
insulin  resistance  and  diabetes.  In  cachectic  subjects,  IGF-1  infusion 
(12  μg/kg  per  h)  enhances  nitrogen  retention  and  lowers  cholesterol 
levels.  Longer-term  subcutaneous  IGF-1  injections  enhance  protein 
synthesis  and  are  anabolic.  Although  bone  formation  markers  are 
induced,  bone  turnover  also  may  be  stimulated  by  IGF-1.  IGF-1  is 
approved for use in patients with GH-resistance syndromes.

IGF-1  side  effects  are  dose  dependent,  and  overdose  may  result 
in  hypoglycemia,  hypotension,  fluid  retention,  temporomandibular 
jaw pain, and increased intracranial pressure, all of which are revers-
ible.  Retinal  damage  and  avascular  femoral  head  necrosis  have  been 
reported.  Chronic  excess  IGF-1  administration  presumably  would 
result in features of acromegaly.

 ■ ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE
(See also Chap. 386)

Synthesis  ACTH-secreting corticotrope cells constitute ~20% of the 
pituitary cell population. ACTH (39 amino acids) is derived from the 
POMC precursor protein (266 amino acids) that also generates several

other peptides, including β-lipotropin, β-endorphin, met-enkephalin, 
α-melanocyte-stimulating  hormone  (α-MSH),  and  corticotropin-like 
intermediate  lobe  protein  (CLIP).  The  POMC  gene  is  potently  sup-
pressed  by  glucocorticoids  and  induced  by  corticotropin-releasing 
hormone  (CRH),  arginine  vasopressin  (AVP),  and  proinflammatory 
cytokines, including IL-6, as well as leukemia inhibitory factor.

CRH, a 41-amino-acid hypothalamic peptide synthesized in the par-
aventricular nucleus as well as in higher brain centers, is the predom-
inant  stimulator  of  ACTH  synthesis  and  release.  The  CRH  receptor 
is a GPCR that is expressed on the corticotrope and signals to induce 
POMC transcription.

Secretion  ACTH secretion is pulsatile and exhibits a characteristic 
circadian  rhythm,  peaking  at  about  6:00  a.m.  and  reaching  a  nadir 
about midnight. Adrenal glucocorticoid secretion, which is driven by 
ACTH, follows a parallel diurnal pattern. ACTH circadian rhythmicity 
is  determined  by  variations  in  secretory  pulse  amplitude  rather  than 
changes in pulse frequency. Superimposed on this endogenous rhythm, 
ACTH levels are increased by physical and psychological stress, exer-
cise, acute illness, and insulin-induced hypoglycemia.

Glucocorticoid-mediated negative regulation of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurs as a consequence of both hypotha-
lamic CRH suppression and direct attenuation of pituitary POMC gene 
expression  and  ACTH  release.  In  contrast,  loss  of  cortisol  feedback 
inhibition,  as  occurs  in  primary  adrenal  failure,  results  in  extremely 
high ACTH levels.

Acute inflammatory or septic insults activate the HPA axis through 
the  integrated  actions  of  proinflammatory  cytokines,  bacterial  toxins, 
and neural signals. The overlapping cascade of ACTH-inducing cytok-
ines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]; IL-1, -2, and -6; and leukemia inhib-
itory factor) activates hypothalamic CRH and AVP secretion, pituitary 
POMC gene expression, and local pituitary paracrine cytokine networks. 
The  resulting  cortisol  elevation  restrains  the  inflammatory  response 
and enables host protection. Concomitantly, cytokine-mediated central 
glucocorticoid receptor resistance impairs glucocorticoid suppression 
of the HPA. Thus, the neuroendocrine stress response reflects the net 
result of highly integrated hypothalamic, intrapituitary, and peripheral 
hormone and cytokine signals acting to regulate cortisol secretion.

Action  The major function of the HPA axis is to maintain metabolic 
homeostasis and mediate the neuroendocrine stress response. ACTH 
induces adrenocortical steroidogenesis by sustaining adrenal cell pro-
liferation and function. The receptor for ACTH, designated melanocor-
tin-2 receptor, is a GPCR that induces steroidogenesis by stimulating a 
cascade of steroidogenic enzymes (Chap. 386).

 ■ GONADOTROPINS: FSH AND LH
Synthesis  and  Secretion  Gonadotrope  cells  constitute  ~10%  of 
anterior pituitary cells and produce two gonadotropin hormones—LH 
and  FSH.  Like  TSH  and  human  chorionic  gonadotropin,  LH  and 
FSH are glycoprotein hormones that comprise α and β subunits. The 
α  subunit  is  common  to  these  glycoprotein  hormones;  specificity  of 
hormone function is conferred by the β subunits, which are expressed 
by separate genes.

Gonadotropin  synthesis  and  release  are  dynamically  regulated.  This 
is  particularly  true  in  women,  in  whom  rapidly  fluctuating  gonadal  ste-
roid  levels  vary  throughout  the  menstrual  cycle.  Hypothalamic  GnRH, 
a  10-amino-acid  peptide,  regulates  the  synthesis  and  secretion  of  both 
LH  and  FSH.  Brain  kisspeptin,  a  product  of  the  KISS1  gene,  regulates 
hypothalamic  GnRH  release.  GnRH  is  secreted  in  discrete  pulses  every 
60–120 min, and the pulses in turn elicit LH and FSH pulses (Fig. 378-3). 
The  pulsatile  mode  of  GnRH  input  is  essential  to  its  action;  pulses 
prime gonadotrope responsiveness, whereas continuous GnRH expo-
sure induces desensitization. Based on this phenomenon, long-acting 
GnRH  agonists  are  used  to  suppress  gonadotropin  levels  in  children 
with precocious puberty and in men with prostate cancer (Chap. 87) 
and  are  used  in  some  ovulation-induction  protocols  to  reduce  levels 

of endogenous gonadotropins (Chap. 392). Estrogens act at both the 
hypothalamus and the pituitary to modulate gonadotropin secretion. 
Chronic estrogen exposure is inhibitory, whereas rising estrogen lev-
els, as occur during the preovulatory surge, exert positive feedback to 
increase  gonadotropin  pulse  frequency  and  amplitude.  Progesterone 
slows  GnRH  pulse  frequency  but  enhances  gonadotropin  responses 
to  GnRH.  Testosterone  feedback  in  men  also  occurs  at  the  hypotha-
lamic and pituitary levels and is mediated in part by its conversion to 
estrogens.

Although  GnRH  is  the  main  regulator  of  LH  and  FSH  secretion, 
FSH  synthesis  is  also  under  distinct  control  by  the  gonadal  peptides 
inhibin  and  activin,  members  of  the  transforming  growth  factor  β 
(TGF-β)  family.  Inhibin  selectively  suppresses  FSH,  whereas  activin 
stimulates FSH synthesis (Chap. 392).

Action  The  gonadotropin  hormones  interact  with  their  respective 
GPCRs expressed in the ovary and testis, evoking germ cell develop-
ment  and  maturation  and  steroid  hormone  biosynthesis.  In  women, 
FSH  regulates  ovarian  follicle  development  and  stimulates  ovarian 
estrogen  production.  LH  mediates  ovulation  and  maintenance  of  the 
corpus luteum. In men, LH induces Leydig cell testosterone synthesis 
and  secretion,  and  FSH  stimulates  seminiferous  tubule  development 
and regulates spermatogenesis.
 ■ THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE
Synthesis  and  Secretion  TSH-secreting  thyrotrope  cells  consti-
tute 5% of the anterior pituitary cell population. TSH shares a common 
α  subunit  with  LH  and  FSH  but  contains  a  specific  TSH  β  subunit. 
TRH is a hypothalamic tripeptide (pyroglutamyl histidylprolinamide) 
that  acts  through  a  pituitary  GPCR  to  stimulate  TSH  synthesis  and 
secretion;  it  also  stimulates  the  lactotrope  cell  to  secrete  PRL.  TSH 
secretion is stimulated by TRH, whereas thyroid hormones, dopamine, 
somatostatin,  and  glucocorticoids  suppress  TSH  by  overriding  TRH 
induction.

Thyrotrope  cell  proliferation  and  TSH  secretion  are  both  induced 
when  negative  feedback  inhibition  by  thyroid  hormones  is  removed. 
Thus,  thyroid  damage  (including  surgical  thyroidectomy),  radia-
tion-induced  hypothyroidism,  chronic  thyroiditis,  and  prolonged 
goitrogen  exposure  are  associated  with  increased  TSH  levels.  
Long-standing untreated hypothyroidism can lead to elevated TSH lev-
els, which may be associated with thyrotrope hyperplasia and pituitary 
enlargement  and  may  sometimes  be  evident  on  magnetic  resonance 
imaging.

Action  TSH  is  secreted  in  pulses,  although  the  excursions  are 
modest in comparison to other pituitary hormones because of the low 
amplitude of the pulses and the relatively long half-life of TSH. Con-
sequently, single determinations of TSH suffice to precisely assess its 
circulating levels. TSH binds to a GPCR on thyroid follicular cells to 
stimulate thyroid hormone synthesis and release (Chap. 382).

379 Hypopituitarism

Shlomo Melmed, J. Larry Jameson

Deficient production of anterior pituitary hormones leads to features 
of hypopituitarism. Impaired production of one or more of the ante-
rior  pituitary  trophic  hormones  can  result  from  inherited  disorders; 
more  commonly,  adult  hypopituitarism  is  acquired  and  reflects  the 
compressive  mass  effects  of  tumors  or  the  consequences  of  local 
pituitary  or  hypothalamic  traumatic,  autoimmune,  inflammatory, 
or  vascular  damage.  These  processes  also  may  impair  synthesis  or 
secretion  of  hypothalamic  hormones,  with  resultant  pituitary  failure  
(Table 379-1).

aTrophic hormone failure associated with pituitary compression or destruction 
usually occurs sequentially: growth hormone > follicle-stimulating hormone > 
luteinizing hormone > thyroid-stimulating hormone > adrenocorticotropic hormone. 
During childhood, growth retardation is often the presenting feature, and in adults, 
hypogonadism is the earliest symptom.

 ■ DEVELOPMENTAL CAUSES OF HYPOPITUITARISM
Pituitary  dysplasia  may  result  in  aplastic,  hypoplastic,  or  ectopic 
pituitary  gland  development.  Because  pituitary  development  follows 
midline cell migration from the nasopharyngeal Rathke’s pouch, mid-
line craniofacial disorders may be associated with pituitary dysplasia. 
Acquired pituitary failure in the newborn also can be caused by birth 
trauma, including cranial hemorrhage, asphyxia, and breech delivery.
A large number of transcription factors and growth factors are crit-
ical for the development of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland and 
the function of differentiated anterior pituitary cell lineages. mutations 
have been described in the HESX1, SOX2, SOX3, LHX3, LHX4, OTX, 
GLI2, PAX6, BMP4, ARNT2, FGF8, FGFR1, SHH, PROKR2, GPR161, 
IGSF1, PITX2, and CHD7 genes, among others. Heterozygous loss-of-
function or autosomal recessive mutations disrupt hypothalamic and 
pituitary development at different developmental stages, causing a wide 
array of phenotypes ranging from severe syndromic midline and other 
defects  to  combined  pituitary  hormone  defects  or  isolated  hormone 
deficiencies.  Depending  on  the  gene  involved,  the  pituitary  may  be 
hypoplastic, hyperplastic, or ectopic. Midline defects include variable 
combinations of abnormal development of the eyes, corpus collosum, 
vertebrae, and genital systems. Pituitary dysfunction ranges from iso-
lated  hormone  deficiency  to  combined  pituitary  hormone  deficiency 
(CPHD) and diabetes insipidus (DI).

In  addition  to  these  syndromic  developmental  disorders,  some 
mutations  affect  specific  pituitary  cell  lineages.  For  example,  Pit-1 
mutations  cause  combined  growth  hormone  (GH),  prolactin  (PRL), 
and  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  (TSH)  deficiencies.  These  patients 
usually  present  with  growth  failure  and  varying  degrees  of  hypothy-
roidism. The pituitary may appear hypoplastic on magnetic resonance 
imaging  (MRI).  Prop-1  is  expressed  early  in  pituitary  development 
and  appears  to  be  required  for  Pit-1  function.  Familial  and  sporadic 
PROP1  mutations  result  in  combined  GH,  PRL,  TSH,  and  gonado-
tropin deficiency. Over 80% of these patients have growth retardation; 
by  adulthood,  all  are  deficient  in  TSH  and  gonadotropins,  and  a 
small  minority  later  develop  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH) 
deficiency.  Because  of  gonadotropin  deficiency,  these  individuals  do 
not  enter  puberty  spontaneously.  In  some  cases,  the  pituitary  gland 
appears enlarged on MRI. TPIT mutations result in ACTH deficiency 
associated with hypocortisolism. Mutations in NR5A1 (also known as 
steroidogenic factor 1 [SF1]) impair development of gonadotrope cells, 
as well as adrenal/gonadal development.

 ■ HYPOTHALAMIC ENDOCRINE DYSFUNCTION
Hypothalamic  disorders  can  affect  temperature  regulation,  appetite, 
sleep-wake cycles, autonomic systems, behavior, and memory, as well 
as multiple endocrine systems. Selected examples of hypothalamic dis-
orders that affect the endocrine system are described below.

Kallmann Syndrome  Kallmann syndrome results from defective 
hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis and 
is associated with anosmia or hyposmia due to olfactory bulb agenesis 
or hypoplasia (Chap. 391). Classically, the syndrome may also be asso-
ciated with color blindness, optic atrophy, nerve deafness, cleft palate, 
renal  abnormalities,  cryptorchidism,  and  neurologic  abnormalities 
such as mirror movements. The initial genetic cause was the X-linked 
KAL gene, mutations of which impair embryonic migration of GnRH 
neurons  from  the  hypothalamic  olfactory  placode  to  the  hypothala-
mus. Since then, more than a dozen additional genetic abnormalities, 
in addition to KAL mutations, have been found to cause isolated GnRH 
deficiency.  Autosomal  recessive  (i.e.,  GPR54,  KISS1)  and  dominant 
(i.e.,  FGFR1)  modes  of  transmission  have  been  described,  and  there 
is a growing list of genes associated with GnRH deficiency (including 
GNRH1,  PROK2,  PROKR2,  CHD7,  PCSK1,  FGF8,  NELF,  WDR11, 
TAC3,  TACR3,  and  SEMA3E).  Some  patients  have  oligogenic  muta-
tions in which mutations in a combination of different genes lead to 
the phenotype. Associated clinical features, in addition to GnRH defi-
ciency, vary depending on the genetic cause. GnRH deficiency prevents 
progression through puberty. Males present with delayed puberty and 
pronounced hypogonadal features, including micropenis, probably the

result of low testosterone levels during infancy. Females present with 
primary amenorrhea and failure of secondary sexual development.

Kallmann  syndrome  and  other  causes  of  congenital  GnRH  defi-
ciency  are  characterized  by  low  luteinizing  hormone  (LH)  and  
follicle-stimulating  hormone  (FSH)  levels  and  low  concentrations  of 
sex  steroids  (testosterone  or  estradiol).  In  sporadic  cases  of  isolated 
gonadotropin deficiency, the diagnosis is often one of exclusion after 
other known causes of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction have been 
eliminated. Repetitive GnRH administration restores normal pituitary 
gonadotropin  responses,  pointing  to  a  hypothalamic  defect  in  these 
patients.

Long-term treatment of males with human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG)  or  testosterone  restores  pubertal  development  and  secondary 
sex  characteristics;  women  can  be  treated  with  cyclic  estrogen  and 
progestin. Fertility may be restored by the administration of gonado-
tropins or by using a portable infusion pump to deliver subcutaneous, 
pulsatile GnRH.

Bardet-Biedl Syndrome  This very rare genetically heterogeneous 
disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, renal abnormalities, 
obesity, and hexadactyly, brachydactyly, or syndactyly. Central DI may 
or  may  not  be  associated.  GnRH  deficiency  occurs  in  75%  of  males 
and  half  of  affected  females.  Retinal  degeneration  begins  in  early 
childhood, and most patients are blind by age 30. Numerous subtypes 
of  Bardet-Biedl  syndrome  (BBS)  have  been  identified,  with  genetic 
linkage to at least nine different loci. Several of the loci encode genes 
involved  in  basal  body  cilia  function,  and  this  may  account  for  the 
diverse clinical manifestations.

Leptin  and  Leptin  Receptor  Mutations  Deficiencies  of  leptin 
or its receptor cause a broad spectrum of hypothalamic abnormalities, 
including hyperphagia, obesity, and central hypogonadism (Chap. 401). 
Decreased  GnRH  production  in  these  patients  results  in  attenuated 
pituitary FSH and LH synthesis and release.

Prader-Willi Syndrome  This is a contiguous gene syndrome that 
results  from  deletion  of  the  paternal  copies  of  the  imprinted  SNRPN 
gene, the NECDIN gene, and possibly other genes on chromosome 15q. 
Prader-Willi  syndrome  is  associated  with  hypogonadotropic  hypo-
gonadism,  hyperphagia-obesity,  chronic  muscle  hypotonia,  mental 
retardation, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus. Multiple somatic defects 
also involve the skull, eyes, ears, hands, and feet. Diminished hypotha-
lamic oxytocin- and vasopressin-producing nuclei have been reported. 
Deficient GnRH synthesis is suggested by the observation that chronic 
GnRH treatment restores pituitary LH and FSH release.

 ■ ACQUIRED HYPOPITUITARISM
Hypopituitarism may be caused by accidental or neurosurgical trauma; 
vascular events such as apoplexy; pituitary or hypothalamic neoplasms, 
craniopharyngioma,  lymphoma,  or  metastatic  tumors;  inflammatory 
disease  such  as  lymphocytic  hypophysitis;  autoimmune  hypophysitis 
associated with checkpoint inhibitor cancer immunotherapy; infiltra-
tive disorders such as sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis (Chap. 414), and 
tuberculosis; or irradiation.

Patients  with  brain  injury,  including  from  contact  sports  trauma, 
motor vehicle accidents, explosive causes, subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
and  irradiation,  can  experience  transient  or  long-term  hypopituitar-
ism.  Long-term  periodic  endocrine  follow-up  is  indicated  because 
hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction will develop in 25–40% of these 
patients.

Hypothalamic Infiltration Disorders  Sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X, 
amyloidosis,  and  hemochromatosis  frequently  involve  both  hypotha-
lamic and pituitary neuronal and neurochemical tracts. Consequently, 
DI is a common presentation, reported in half of patients with these 
disorders. Growth retardation is seen if attenuated GH secretion occurs 
before  puberty.  Hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  and  hyperprolac-
tinemia are also common.

Inflammatory  Lesions  Pituitary  damage  and  subsequent  secre-
tory  dysfunction  can  be  seen  with  chronic  site  infections  such  as 

tuberculosis,  with  opportunistic  fungal  infections  associated  with 
AIDS, and in tertiary syphilis. Other inflammatory processes, such as 
granulomas  and  sarcoidosis,  should  be  considered  in  the  differential 
diagnosis of imaging studies suggestive of a pituitary adenoma. These 
lesions may cause extensive hypothalamic and pituitary damage, lead-
ing to hormone deficiencies.

2897

Cranial  Irradiation  Cranial  irradiation  may  result  in  long-term 
hypothalamic  and  pituitary  dysfunction,  especially  in  children  and 
adolescents, as they are more susceptible to damage after whole-brain 
or  head  and  neck  therapeutic  irradiation.  The  development  of  sub-
sequent  hormonal  abnormalities  correlates  strongly  with  irradiation 
dosage and the time interval after completion of radiotherapy. Up to 
two-thirds of patients ultimately develop hormone insufficiency after a 
median dose of 50 Gy (5000 rad) directed at the skull base. The devel-
opment of hypopituitarism occurs over 5–15 years and usually reflects 
hypothalamic  damage  rather  than  primary  destruction  of  pituitary 
cells. Although the pattern of hormone loss is variable, GH deficiency 
is most common, followed by gonadotropin, thyroid, and ACTH defi-
ciency. When deficiency of one or more hormones is documented, the 
possibility of diminished reserve of other hormones is likely. Accord-
ingly, anterior pituitary function should be continually evaluated over 
the long term in previously irradiated patients, and replacement ther-
apy instituted when appropriate (see below).

Lymphocytic  Hypophysitis  This  occurs  most  often  in  post-
partum  women;  it  usually  presents  with  hyperprolactinemia  and 
MRI evidence of a prominent pituitary mass that often resembles an 
adenoma, with mildly elevated PRL levels. Pituitary failure caused by 
diffuse  lymphocytic  infiltration  may  be  transient  or  permanent  but 
requires immediate evaluation and treatment. Rarely, isolated pituitary 
hormone deficiencies have been described, suggesting a selective auto-
immune process targeted to specific cell types. Most patients manifest 
symptoms of progressive mass effects with headache and visual distur-
bance.  The  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  often  is  elevated.  Because 
it may be indistinguishable from a pituitary adenoma on MRI, hypo-
physitis  should  be  considered  in  a  postpartum  woman  with  a  newly 
diagnosed pituitary mass before an unnecessary surgical intervention 
is  undertaken.  The  inflammatory  process  often  resolves  after  several 
months  of  glucocorticoid  treatment,  and  pituitary  function  may  be 
restored, depending on the extent of damage.

Immunotherapy  and  Hypophysitis  Pituitary  cells  express 
cytotoxic  T  lymphocyte  antigen-4  (CTLA-4),  and  up  to  20%  of 
patients  receiving  cancer  immunotherapy  with  CTLA-4  inhibitors 
(e.g.,  ipilimumab)  may  develop  hypophysitis  with  heterogeneously 
associated thyroid, adrenal, islet, and gonadal failure. Hypophysitis is 
also  reported  with  PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors  (e.g.,  pembrolizumab  and 
nivolumab)  and  may  show  delayed  presentation.  Pituitary  hormone 
replacement, with or without high-dose glucocorticoids, may be safely 
tolerated with continued immunotherapy.

Pituitary  Apoplexy  Acute  intrapituitary  hemorrhagic  vascular 
events can cause substantial damage to the pituitary and surrounding 
sellar  structures.  Pituitary  apoplexy  may  occur  spontaneously  in  a 
preexisting  pituitary  adenoma;  postpartum  (Sheehan’s  syndrome);  or 
in association with diabetes, hypertension, sickle cell anemia, or acute 
shock.  The  hyperplastic  enlargement  of  the  pituitary,  which  occurs 
normally  during  pregnancy,  increases  the  risk  for  hemorrhage  and 
infarction.  Apoplexy  is  an  endocrine  emergency  that  may  result  in 
severe hypoglycemia, hypotension and shock, central nervous system 
(CNS)  hemorrhage,  and  death.  Acute  symptoms  may  include  severe 
headache  with  signs  of  meningeal  irritation,  bilateral  visual  changes, 
ophthalmoplegia, and, in severe cases, cardiovascular collapse and loss 
of  consciousness.  Pituitary  computed  tomography  (CT)  or  MRI  may 
reveal signs of intratumoral or sellar hemorrhage, with pituitary stalk 
deviation and compression of pituitary tissue.

Patients with no evident visual loss or impaired consciousness can 
be  observed  and  managed  conservatively  with  high-dose  glucocorti-
coids. Those with significant or progressive visual loss, cranial nerve

2898 palsy, or loss of consciousness require urgent surgical decompression. 
Visual  recovery  after  sellar  surgery  is  inversely  correlated  with  the 
length of time after the acute event. Therefore, severe ophthalmoplegia 
or visual deficits are indications for early surgery. Hypopituitarism is 
common after apoplexy.

Empty  Sella  A  partial  or  apparently  totally  empty  sella  is  often 
an  incidental  MRI  finding  and  may  sometimes  be  associated  with 
intracranial  hypertension.  These  patients  usually  have  normal  pitu-
itary function, implying that the surrounding rim of pituitary tissue is 
fully  functional.  Hypopituitarism,  however,  may  develop  insidiously. 
Pituitary  adenomas  also  may  undergo  clinically  silent  infarction  and 
involution  with  development  of  a  partial  or  totally  empty  sella  by 
cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  filling  the  dural  herniation.  Rarely,  small 
but functional pituitary adenomas may arise within the rim of normal 
pituitary tissue, and they are not always visible on MRI.
 ■ PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS
The clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism depend on which hor-
mones are lost and the extent of the hormone deficiency (see below). 
GH deficiency causes growth disorders in children and leads to abnor-
mal  body  composition  in  adults.  Gonadotropin  deficiency  causes 
menstrual  disorders  and  infertility  in  women  and  decreased  sexual 
function,  infertility,  and  loss  of  secondary  sexual  characteristics  in 

men. TSH and ACTH deficiencies usually develop later in the course of 
pituitary failure. TSH deficiency causes growth retardation in children 
and  features  of  hypothyroidism  in  children  and  adults.  The  second-
ary  form  of  adrenal  insufficiency  caused  by  ACTH  deficiency  leads 
to  hypocortisolism  with  relative  preservation  of  mineralocorticoid 
production.  PRL  deficiency  causes  failure  of  lactation.  When  lesions 
involve the posterior pituitary, polyuria and polydipsia reflect loss of 
vasopressin secretion. In patients with long-standing pituitary damage, 
epidemiologic studies document an increased mortality rate, primarily 
from  increased  cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  disease.  Previous 
head or neck irradiation is also a determinant of increased mortality 
rates in patients with hypopituitarism, especially from cerebrovascular 
disease.

 ■ LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
Biochemical  diagnosis  of  pituitary  insufficiency  is  made  by  demon-
strating  low  levels  of  respective  pituitary  trophic  hormones  in  the 
setting of low levels of target organ hormones. For example, low free 
thyroxine in the setting of a low or inappropriately normal TSH level 
suggests secondary hypothyroidism. Similarly, a low testosterone level 
without elevation of gonadotropins suggests hypogonadotropic hypo-
gonadism. Provocative tests may be required to assess pituitary reserve  
(Table 379-2). GH responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, arginine,

glucagon,  l-dopa,  growth  hormone–releasing  hormone  (GHRH), 
or  growth  hormone–releasing  orally  active  ghrelin  receptor  agonist 
macimorelin can be used to assess GH reserve. Corticotropin-releasing 
hormone  (CRH)  administration  induces  ACTH  release,  and  admin-
istration  of  synthetic  ACTH  (cosyntropin)  evokes  adrenal  cortisol 
release as an indirect indicator of pituitary ACTH reserve (Chap. 386). 
ACTH reserve is most reliably assessed by measuring ACTH and cor-
tisol  levels  during  insulin-induced  hypoglycemia.  However,  this  test 
should  be  performed  cautiously  in  patients  with  suspected  adrenal 
insufficiency because of enhanced susceptibility to hypoglycemia and 
hypotension.  Administering  insulin  to  induce  hypoglycemia  is  con-
traindicated in patients with active coronary artery disease or known 
seizure disorders.

TREATMENT
Hypopituitarism

Hormone  replacement  therapy,  including  glucocorticoids,  thyroid 
hormone,  sex  steroids,  GH,  and  vasopressin,  is  usually  safe  and 
free  of  complications.  Treatment  regimens  that  mimic  physiologic 
hormone production allow for maintenance of satisfactory clinical 
homeostasis. Effective dosage schedules are outlined in Table 379-3. 
Patients  in  need  of  glucocorticoid  replacement  require  especially 
careful dose adjustments during stressful events such as acute ill-
ness, dental procedures, trauma, and hospitalization.

 ■ DISORDERS OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Skeletal Maturation and Somatic Growth  The growth plate is 
dependent  on  a  variety  of  hormonal  stimuli,  including  GH,  insulin-
like growth factor (IGF)-1, sex steroids, thyroid hormones, paracrine 
and  circulating  growth  factors  (e.g.,  fibroblast  growth  factor  family), 
and  cytokines.  The  growth-promoting  process  also  requires  caloric 
energy, amino acids, vitamins, and trace metals and consumes ~10% of 
normal energy production. Malnutrition impairs chondrocyte activity, 
increases  GH  resistance,  and  leads  to  reduced  circulating  IGF-1  and 
IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 levels.

Linear bone growth rates are very high in infancy and are pituitary 
dependent. Mean growth velocity is ~6 cm/year in later childhood and

usually is maintained within a given range on a standardized percentile 
chart.  Peak  growth  rates  occur  during  midpuberty  when  bone  age  is 
12  (girls)  or  13  (boys).  Secondary  sexual  development  is  associated 
with  elevated  sex  steroids  that  cause  progressive  epiphyseal  growth 
plate closure. Bone age is delayed in patients with all forms of true GH 
deficiency or GH receptor defects that result in attenuated GH action.
Short stature may occur as a result of constitutive intrinsic growth 
defects or because of acquired extrinsic factors that impair growth. In 
general, delayed bone age in a child with short stature is suggestive of 
a hormonal or systemic disorder, whereas normal bone age in a short 
child  is  more  likely  to  be  caused  by  a  genetic  cartilage  dysplasia  or 
growth plate disorder (Chap. 413).

GH  Deficiency  in  Children 
Isolated  GH  deficiency  is  charac-
terized by short stature, micropenis, increased fat, high-pitched voice, 
and a propensity to hypoglycemia due to relatively unopposed insulin 
action.  Familial  modes  of  inheritance  are  seen  in  at  least  one-third 
of  these  individuals  and  may  be  autosomal  dominant,  recessive,  or 
X-linked. About 10% of children with GH deficiency have mutations 
in the GH-N gene, including gene deletions and a wide range of point 
mutations. Mutations in transcription factors Pit-1 and Prop-1, which 
control somatotrope development (see above), result in GH deficiency 
in combination with other pituitary hormone deficiencies, which may 
become  manifest  only  in  adulthood.  The  diagnosis  of  idiopathic  GH 
deficiency  should  be  made  only  after  known  molecular  defects  have 
been rigorously excluded.

GHRH  RECEPTOR  MUTATIONS  Recessive  mutations  of  the  GHRH 
receptor gene in subjects with severe proportionate dwarfism are asso-
ciated with low basal GH levels that cannot be stimulated by exogenous 
GHRH,  GH-releasing  peptide,  or  insulin-induced  hypoglycemia,  as 
well  as  anterior  pituitary  hypoplasia.  The  syndrome  exemplifies  the 
importance  of  the  GHRH  receptor  for  determining  somatotrope  cell 
proliferation and hormonal responsiveness.

GH INSENSITIVITY  This is caused by defects of GH receptor structure 
or signaling. Homozygous or heterozygous mutations of the GH recep-
tor are associated with partial or complete GH insensitivity and growth 
failure  (Laron  syndrome).  The  diagnosis  is  based  on  normal  or  high 
GH  levels,  with  decreased  circulating  GH-binding  protein  (GHBP), 
and low IGF-1 levels. Very rarely, defective IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor, or 
IGF-1 signaling defects are also encountered. STAT5B mutations result 
in both immunodeficiency as well as abrogated GH signaling, leading 
to short stature with normal or elevated GH levels and low IGF-1 levels. 
Circulating  GH  receptor  antibodies  may  rarely  cause  peripheral  GH 
insensitivity.

NUTRITIONAL  SHORT  STATURE  Caloric  deprivation  and  malnutri-
tion,  uncontrolled  diabetes,  and  chronic  renal  failure  represent  sec-
ondary  causes  of  abrogated  GH  receptor  function.  These  conditions 
also stimulate production of proinflammatory cytokines, which act to 
exacerbate  the  block  of  GH-mediated  signal  transduction.  Children 
with these conditions typically exhibit features of acquired short stature 
with normal or elevated GH and low IGF-1 levels.

PSYCHOSOCIAL  SHORT  STATURE  Emotional  and  social  deprivation 
lead to growth retardation accompanied by delayed speech, discordant 
hyperphagia, and an attenuated response to administered GH. A nur-
turing environment restores growth rates.

 ■ PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS
Short  stature  is  commonly  encountered  in  clinical  practice,  and 
the  decision  to  evaluate  these  children  requires  clinical  judgment 
in  association  with  auxologic  data  and  family  history.  Short  stature 
should be evaluated comprehensively if a patient’s height is >3 standard 
deviations  below  the  mean  for  age  or  if  the  growth  rate  has  deceler-
ated. Skeletal maturation is best evaluated by measuring a radiologic 
bone age, which is based mainly on the degree of wrist bone growth 
plate  fusion.  Final  height  can  be  predicted  using  standardized  scales 
(Bayley-Pinneau  or  Tanner-Whitehouse)  or  estimated  by  adding 
6.5 cm (boys) or subtracting 6.5 cm (girls) from the midparental height.

 ■ LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
Because  GH  secretion  is  pulsatile,  GH  deficiency  is  best  assessed  by 
examining  the  response  to  provocative  stimuli,  including  exercise, 
insulin-induced  hypoglycemia,  and  other  pharmacologic  tests  that 
normally increase GH to >7 μg/L in children. Random GH measure-
ments  do  not  distinguish  normal  children  from  those  with  true  GH 
deficiency. Adequate adrenal and thyroid hormone replacement should 
be assured before testing. Age-matched IGF-1 levels are not sufficiently 
sensitive or specific to make the diagnosis but can be useful to confirm 
GH  deficiency.  Pituitary  MRI  may  reveal  pituitary  mass  lesions  or 
structural defects. Molecular analyses for known mutations should be 
undertaken when the cause of short stature remains cryptic or when 
additional clinical features suggest a genetic cause.

TREATMENT
Disorders of Growth and Development

Replacement  therapy  with  recombinant  GH  (0.02–0.05  mg/kg 
per  day  SC)  restores  growth  velocity  in  GH-deficient  children  to   
~10 cm/year. If pituitary insufficiency is documented, other asso-
ciated hormone deficits should be corrected, especially adrenal ste-
roids. In selected situations, GH treatment may be combined with 
strategies to delay puberty (e.g., GnRH agonist) or reduce sex ste-
roids (e.g., aromatase inhibitors) as a means to mitigate sex steroid 
effect on epiphyseal closure. GH treatment is also moderately effec-
tive for accelerating growth rates in children with Turner syndrome 
and  chronic  renal  failure.  Treating  psychosocial  or  constitutional 
(idiopathic) short stature with GH is not uniformly recommended 
as  these  children  may  only  experience  modest  additive  growth, 
which should be weighed against GH cost and side effect profiles.

In patients with GH insensitivity and growth retardation due to 
mutations of the GH receptor, treatment with IGF-1 bypasses the 
dysfunctional GH receptor.

ADULT GH DEFICIENCY
Adult GH deficiency (AGHD) usually is caused by acquired hypotha-
lamic  or  pituitary  somatotrope  damage.  Acquired  pituitary  hormone 
deficiency  follows  a  typical  pattern  in  which  loss  of  adequate  GH 
reserve  foreshadows  subsequent  hormone  deficits.  The  sequential 
order of hormone loss is usually GH → FSH/LH → TSH  → ACTH. 
Patients  previously  diagnosed  with  childhood-onset  GH  deficiency 
should be retested as adults to affirm the diagnosis.
 ■ PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS
The clinical features of AGHD include changes in body composition, 
lipid  metabolism,  and  quality  of  life  and  cardiovascular  dysfunction 
(Table  379-4).  Body  composition  changes  are  common  and  include 
reduced lean body mass, increased fat mass with selective deposition 
of intraabdominal visceral fat, and increased waist-to-hip ratio. Hyper-
lipidemia,  left  ventricular  dysfunction,  hypertension,  and  increased 
plasma  fibrinogen  levels  also  may  be  present.  Bone  mineral  content 
is reduced, with resultant increased fracture rates. Patients may expe-
rience  social  isolation,  depression,  and  difficulty  maintaining  gainful 
employment.  Adult  hypopituitarism  is  associated  with  a  threefold 
increase  in  cardiovascular  mortality  rates  in  comparison  to  age-  and 
sex-matched  controls,  and  this  may  be  due  to  GH  deficiency,  as 
patients  in  these  studies  were  replaced  with  other  deficient  pituitary 
hormones.
 ■ LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
AGHD  is  rare,  and  in  light  of  the  nonspecific  nature  of  associated 
clinical symptoms, patients appropriate for testing should be selected 
carefully  on  the  basis  of  well-defined  criteria.  With  few  exceptions, 
testing  should  be  restricted  to  patients  with  the  following  predis-
posing  factors:  (1)  pituitary  surgery,  (2)  pituitary  or  hypothalamic 
tumor or granulomas, (3) history of cranial irradiation, (4) radiologic 
evidence of a pituitary lesion, and (5) childhood requirement for GH 
replacement  therapy.  The  transition  of  a  GH-deficient  adolescent  to

adulthood  requires  retesting  to  document  subsequent  AGHD.  Up  to 
20% of patients previously treated for childhood-onset GH deficiency 
are found to be GH sufficient on repeat testing as adults.

A  significant  proportion  (~25%)  of  truly  GH-deficient  adults  have 
low-normal IGF-1 levels. Thus, as in the evaluation of GH deficiency in 
children, valid age-matched IGF-1 measurements provide a useful index 
of therapeutic responses but are not sufficiently precise for diagnostic 
purposes.  The  most  validated  test  to  distinguish  pituitary-sufficient 
patients  from  those  with  AGHD  is  insulin-induced  (0.05–0.1  U/kg) 
hypoglycemia.  After  glucose  reduction  to  ~40  mg/dL,  most  individu-
als experience neuroglycopenic symptoms (Chap. 406), and peak GH 
release occurs at 60 min and remains elevated for up to 2 h. About 90% 
of healthy adults exhibit GH responses >5 μg/L; AGHD is defined by 
a peak GH response to hypoglycemia of <3 μg/L. Although insulin- 
induced hypoglycemia is safe when performed under appropriate super-
vision,  it  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  diabetes,  ischemic  heart 
disease,  cerebrovascular  disease,  or  epilepsy  and  in  elderly  patients. 
Alternative stimulatory tests include intravenous arginine (30 g), GHRH 
(1  μg/kg),  oral  ghrelin  receptor  agonist  (0.5  mg/kg),  and  glucagon  
(1 mg). Combinations of these tests may evoke GH secretion in sub-
jects who are not responsive to a single test.

TREATMENT
Adult GH Deficiency

Once the diagnosis of AGHD is unequivocally established, replace-
ment of GH may be indicated. Contraindications to therapy include 
the presence of an active neoplasm, intracranial hypertension, and 
uncontrolled  diabetes  and  retinopathy.  The  starting  adult  dose  of 
0.1–0.2 mg/d should be titrated (up to a maximum of 1.25 mg/d) 
to  maintain  IGF-1  levels  in  the  mid-normal  range  for  age-  and

sex-matched  controls  (Fig.  379-1).  Women  require  higher  doses 
than  men,  and  elderly  patients  require  less  GH.  Long-term  GH 
maintenance  sustains  normal  IGF-1  levels  and  is  associated  with 
persistent  body  composition  changes  (e.g.,  enhanced  lean  body 
mass  and  lower  body  fat).  High-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol 
increases,  but  total  cholesterol  and  insulin  levels  may  not  change 
significantly.  Lumbar  spine  bone  mineral  density  increases,  but 
this  response  is  gradual  (>1  year).  Many  patients  note  significant 
improvement  in  quality  of  life  when  evaluated  by  standardized 
questionnaires. The effect of GH replacement on mortality rates in 
GH-deficient patients is currently the subject of long-term prospec-
tive investigation. Recently approved long-acting GH preparations 
for patients with AGHD require weekly injections. Ideally, dosing 
should be titrated to achieve normal but not supra-normal IGF-1 
levels. Early reports indicate that side effects appear similar to sub-
cutaneous formulations.

About 30% of patients exhibit reversible dose-related fluid reten-
tion,  joint  pain,  and  carpal  tunnel  syndrome,  and  up  to  40% 
exhibit myalgias and paresthesia. Patients receiving insulin require 
careful  monitoring  for  dosing  adjustments,  as  GH  is  a  potent 
counterregulatory  hormone  for  insulin  action.  Patients  with  type 
2 diabetes mellitus may initially develop further insulin resistance. 
However,  glycemic  control  usually  improves  with  the  sustained 
loss  of  abdominal  fat  associated  with  long-term  GH  replacement. 
Headache, increased intracranial pressure, hypertension, and tinni-
tus occur rarely. Pituitary tumor regrowth and progression of skin 
lesions  or  other  tumors  have  not  been  encountered  in  long-term 
surveillance programs with appropriate replacement doses.

ACTH DEFICIENCY
 ■ PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS
Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs as a result of pituitary ACTH 
deficiency.  It  is  characterized  by  fatigue,  weakness,  anorexia,  nausea, 
vomiting,  and,  occasionally,  hypoglycemia.  In  contrast  to  primary 
adrenal failure, hypocortisolism associated with pituitary failure usu-
ally  is  not  accompanied  by  hyperpigmentation  or  mineralocorticoid 
deficiency.

ACTH  deficiency  is  commonly  due  to  glucocorticoid  with-
drawal  after  treatment-associated  suppression  of  the  hypothalamic- 
pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis.  Isolated  ACTH  deficiency  may  occur 
after surgical resection of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma that 
has suppressed the HPA axis; this phenomenon is in fact suggestive of 

a surgical cure. The mass effects of other pituitary adenomas or sellar 
lesions  may  lead  to  ACTH  deficiency,  usually  in  combination  with 
other  pituitary  hormone  deficiencies.  Partial  ACTH  deficiency  may 
be  unmasked  in  the  presence  of  an  acute  medical  or  surgical  illness, 
when clinically significant hypocortisolism reflects diminished ACTH 
reserve.  Rarely,  TPIT  or  POMC  mutations  result  in  primary  ACTH 
deficiency.

 ■ LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS
Inappropriately low ACTH levels in the setting of low cortisol levels are 
characteristic of diminished ACTH reserve. Low basal serum cortisol 
levels are associated with blunted cortisol responses to ACTH stimula-
tion and impaired cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia 
or testing with metyrapone or CRH. For a description of provocative 
ACTH tests, see Chap. 386.

TREATMENT
ACTH Deficiency

Glucocorticoid  replacement  therapy  improves  most  features  of 
ACTH deficiency. The total daily dose of hydrocortisone replace-
ment preferably should generally not exceed 20 mg daily, divided 
into two or three doses. Prednisone (5 mg each morning) is longer 
acting  and  has  fewer  mineralocorticoid  effects  than  hydrocorti-
sone.  Some  authorities  advocate  lower  maintenance  doses  in  an 
effort to avoid cushingoid side effects. Doses should be increased 
severalfold during periods of acute illness or stress. Patients should 
wear medical alert bracelets and/or carry identification cards with 
information about their glucocorticoid requirements.

GONADOTROPIN DEFICIENCY
Hypogonadism is the most common presenting feature of adult hypo-
pituitarism even when other pituitary hormones are also deficient. It 
is  often  a  harbinger  of  hypothalamic  or  pituitary  lesions  that  impair 
GnRH  production  or  delivery  through  the  pituitary  stalk.  As  noted 
below, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a common presenting fea-
ture of hyperprolactinemia.

A  variety  of  inherited  and  acquired  disorders  are  associated  with 
isolated  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  (Chap.  391).  Hypothalamic 
defects associated with GnRH deficiency include Kallmann syndrome 
and mutations in more than a dozen genes that regulate GnRH neu-
ron  migration,  development,  and  function  (see  above).  Mutations  in 
GPR54, DAX1, NR5A1, kisspeptin, the GnRH receptor, and the LHβ 
or  FSHβ  subunit  genes  also  cause  pituitary  gonadotropin  deficiency. 
Acquired  forms  of  GnRH  deficiency  leading  to  hypogonadotropism 
are  seen  in  association  with  anorexia  nervosa,  stress,  starvation,  and 
extreme exercise but also may be idiopathic. Hypogonadotropic hypo-
gonadism  in  these  disorders  is  reversed  by  removal  of  the  stressful 
stimulus or by caloric replenishment.

 ■ PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS
In premenopausal women, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism presents 
as  diminished  ovarian  function  leading  to  oligomenorrhea  or  amen-
orrhea,  infertility,  decreased  vaginal  secretions,  decreased  libido,  and 
breast atrophy. In hypogonadal adult men, secondary testicular failure 
is  associated  with  decreased  libido  and  potency,  infertility,  decreased 
muscle mass with weakness, reduced beard and body hair growth, soft 
testes,  and  characteristic  fine  facial  wrinkles.  Osteoporosis  occurs  in 
both untreated hypogonadal women and men.

 ■ LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
Central hypogonadism is associated with low or inappropriately normal 
serum gonadotropin levels in the setting of low sex hormone concen-
trations  (testosterone  in  men,  estradiol  in  women).  Because  gonado-
tropin  secretion  is  pulsatile,  valid  assessments  may  require  repeated 
measurements or the use of pooled serum samples. Men have reduced 
sperm counts.

Intravenous  GnRH  (100  μg)  stimulates  gonadotropes  to  secrete 
LH (which peaks within 30 min) and FSH (which plateaus during the 
ensuing 60 min). Normal responses vary according to menstrual cycle 
stage, age, and sex of the patient. Generally, LH levels increase about 
threefold, whereas FSH responses are less pronounced. In the setting 
of gonadotropin deficiency, a normal gonadotropin response to GnRH 
indicates  intact  pituitary  gonadotrope  function  and  suggests  a  hypo-
thalamic abnormality. An absent response, however, does not reliably 
distinguish pituitary from hypothalamic causes of hypogonadism. For 
this reason, GnRH testing usually adds little to the information gained 
from  baseline  evaluation  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadotrope 
axis  except  in  cases  of  isolated  GnRH  deficiency  (e.g.,  Kallmann 
syndrome).

MRI  examination  of  the  sellar  region  and  assessment  of  other 
pituitary functions usually are indicated in patients with documented 
central hypogonadism.

TREATMENT
Gonadotropin Deficiency

In  males,  testosterone  replacement  is  necessary  to  achieve  and 
maintain normal growth and development of the external genitalia, 
secondary sex characteristics, male sexual behavior, and androgenic 
anabolic  effects,  including  maintenance  of  muscle  function  and 
bone  mass.  Testosterone  may  be  administered  by  intramuscular 
injections  every  1–4  weeks  or  by  using  skin  patches  or  testoster-
one  gels  (Chap.  391).  Gonadotropin  injections  (hCG  or  human 
menopausal gonadotropin [hMG]) over 12–18 months are used to 
restore fertility. Pulsatile GnRH therapy (25–150 ng/kg every 2 h), 
administered by a subcutaneous infusion pump, is also effective for 
treatment of hypothalamic hypogonadism when fertility is desired.
In premenopausal women, cyclical replacement of estrogen and 
progesterone maintains secondary sexual characteristics and integ-
rity  of  genitourinary  tract  mucosa  and  prevents  premature  osteo-
porosis  (Chap.  392).  Gonadotropin  therapy  is  used  for  ovulation 
induction.  Follicular  growth  and  maturation  are  initiated  using 
hMG  or  recombinant  FSH;  hCG  or  human  luteinizing  hormone 
(hLH)  is  subsequently  injected  to  induce  ovulation.  As  in  men, 
pulsatile GnRH therapy can be used to treat hypothalamic causes of 
gonadotropin deficiency.

HYPOTHALAMIC, PITUITARY, AND  
OTHER SELLAR MASSES
 ■ EVALUATION OF SELLAR MASSES
Local Mass Effects  Clinical manifestations of sellar lesions vary, 
depending on the anatomic location of the mass and the direction of 
its extension (Table 380-1). The dorsal sellar diaphragm presents the 
least  resistance  to  soft  tissue  expansion  from  the  sella;  consequently, 
pituitary adenomas frequently extend in a suprasellar direction. Bony 
invasion may occur as well, especially through the sellar floor to the 
sphenoid sinus (Fig. 380-1).

Headaches  are  common  features  of  small  intrasellar  tumors,  even 
with no demonstrable suprasellar extension. Because of the confined 
nature of the pituitary, small changes in intrasellar pressure stretch the 
dural plate; however, headache severity correlates poorly with adenoma 
size or extension.

Suprasellar extension can lead to visual loss by several mechanisms, 
the most common being compression of the optic chiasm. Rarely, direct 
invasion  of  the  optic  nerves  or  obstruction  of  cerebrospinal  fluid 
(CSF) flow leading to secondary visual disturbances can occur. Pitu-
itary stalk compression by a hormonally active or inactive intrasellar 
mass  may  compress  the  portal  vessels,  disrupting  pituitary  access  to

hypothalamic hormones and dopamine; this results in early hyperpro-
lactinemia and later concurrent loss of other pituitary hormones. This 
“stalk section” phenomenon may also be caused by trauma, whiplash 
injury  with  posterior  clinoid  stalk  compression,  or  skull  base  frac-
tures. Lateral mass invasion may impinge on the cavernous sinus and 
compress its neural contents, leading to cranial nerve III, IV, and VI 
palsies as well as effects on the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of 
the fifth cranial nerve (Chap. 441). Patients may present with diplopia, 
ptosis,  ophthalmoplegia,  and  decreased  facial  sensation,  depending 
on  the  extent  of  neural  damage.  Extension  into  the  sphenoid  sinus 
indicates  that  the  pituitary  mass  has  eroded  through  the  sellar  floor 
(Fig. 380-1). Aggressive tumors rarely invade the palate roof and cause 
nasopharyngeal obstruction, infection, and CSF leakage. Temporal and 
frontal lobe involvement may rarely lead to uncinate seizures, person-
ality  disorders,  and  anosmia.  Direct  hypothalamic  encroachment  by 
an  invasive  pituitary  mass  may  cause  important  metabolic  sequelae, 
including  precocious  puberty  or  hypogonadism,  diabetes  insipidus, 
sleep disturbances, dysthermia, and appetite disorders.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging  Sagittal and coronal T1-weighted 
magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  before  and  after  administration 
of gadolinium allows precise visualization of the pituitary gland with 
clear delineation of the hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, pituitary tissue 

and  surrounding  suprasellar  cisterns,  cavernous  sinuses,  sphenoid 
sinus, and optic chiasm. Pituitary gland height ranges from 6 mm in 
children to 8 mm in adults; during pregnancy and puberty, the height 
may reach 10–12 mm. The upper aspect of the adult pituitary is flat or 
slightly concave, but in adolescent and pregnant individuals, this sur-
face may be convex, reflecting physiologic pituitary enlargement. The 
stalk should be midline and vertical.

Anterior  pituitary  gland  soft  tissue  consistency  is  slightly  heteroge-
neous  on  MRI,  and  signal  intensity  resembles  that  of  brain  matter  on 
T1-weighted  imaging  (Fig.  380-2).  Adenoma  density  is  usually  lower 
than that of surrounding normal tissue on T1-weighted imaging, and the 
signal intensity increases with T2-weighted images. Computed tomog-
raphy (CT) scan is reserved to define the extent of bony erosion or the 
presence of calcification.

Sellar  masses  are  encountered  commonly  as  incidental  findings 
on  MRI,  and  most  are  pituitary  adenomas  (incidentalomas).  In  the 
absence of hormone hypersecretion, these small intrasellar lesions can 
be monitored safely with MRI, which is performed annually and then 
less often if there is no evidence of further growth. Resection should be 
considered for incidentally discovered larger macroadenomas, because 
about  one-third  become  invasive  or  cause  local  pressure  effects.  If 
hormone hypersecretion is identified, specific therapies are indicated 
as described below. When larger masses (>1 cm) are encountered, they

Ophthalmologic Evaluation  Because optic tracts may be contigu-
ous to an expanding pituitary mass, reproducible visual field assessment 
using  perimetry  techniques  should  be  performed  on  all  patients  with 
sellar  mass  lesions  that  impinge  the  optic  chiasm  (Chap.  32).  Bitem-
poral  hemianopia,  often  more  pronounced  superiorly,  is  observed 
classically.  It  occurs  because  nasal  ganglion  cell  fibers,  which  cross 
in  the  optic  chiasm,  are  especially  vulnerable  to  compression  of  the 
ventral  optic  chiasm.  Occasionally,  homonymous  hemianopia  occurs 
from postchiasmal compression or monocular temporal field loss from 
prechiasmal compression. Invasion of the cavernous sinus can produce 
diplopia  from  ocular  motor  nerve  palsy.  Early  diagnosis  reduces  the 
risk of optic atrophy, vision loss, or eye misalignment.

Laboratory Investigation  The presenting clinical features of func-
tional pituitary adenomas (e.g., acromegaly, prolactinoma, or Cushing’s 
disease)  should  guide  the  laboratory  studies  (Table  380-2).  However, 
for a sellar mass with no obvious clinical features of hormone excess, 
laboratory  studies  are  geared  toward  determining  the  nature  of  the 
tumor and assessing the possible presence of hypopituitarism. When 
a  pituitary  adenoma  is  suspected  based  on  MRI,  initial  hormonal 
evaluation usually includes (1) basal prolactin (PRL); (2) insulin-like 
growth  factor  (IGF)-1;  (3)  24-h  urinary  free  cortisol  (UFC)  and/or 
overnight oral dexamethasone (1 mg) suppression test; (4) α subunit, 
follicle-stimulating  hormone  (FSH),  and  luteinizing  hormone  (LH); 
and  (5)  thyroid  function  tests.  Additional  hormonal  evaluation  may 
be indicated based on the results of these tests. Pending more detailed 
assessment  of  hypopituitarism,  a  menstrual  history,  measurement  of 
testosterone and 8 a.m. cortisol levels, and thyroid function tests usu-
ally identify patients with pituitary hormone deficiencies that require 
hormone replacement before further testing or surgery (Chap. 379).

Histologic  Evaluation 
Immunohistochemical  staining  of  pitu-
itary  tumor  specimens  obtained  at  transsphenoidal  surgery  for  hor-
mones  as  well  as  cell-type  specific  transcription  factors  confirms 
clinical  and  laboratory  studies  and  provides  a  histologic  diagnosis 
when  hormone  studies  are  equivocal  and  in  cases  of  clinically  non-
functioning tumors.

TREATMENT
Hypothalamic, Pituitary, and Other Sellar Masses 

OVERVIEW
Successful management of sellar masses requires accurate diagnosis 
as  well  as  selection  of  optimal  therapeutic  modalities.  Most  pitu-
itary tumors are benign and slow growing. Clinical features result 
from  local  mass  effects  and  hormonal  hyper-  or  hyposecretion 
syndromes caused directly by the adenoma or occurring as a conse-
quence of treatment. Thus, lifelong management and follow-up are 
necessary for these patients.

MRI  with  gadolinium  enhancement  for  pituitary  visualiza-
tion, new advances in transsphenoidal surgery and in stereotactic 
radiotherapy,  and  novel  therapeutic  agents  have  improved  pitu-
itary  tumor  management.  The  goals  of  pituitary  tumor  treatment 
include normalization of excess pituitary secretion, amelioration of 
symptoms  and  signs  of  hormonal  hypersecretion  syndromes,  and 
shrinkage or ablation of large tumor masses with relief of adjacent 
structure compression. Residual anterior pituitary function should 
be preserved during treatment and sometimes can be restored by 
removing the tumor mass. Ideally, adenoma recurrence should be 
prevented. 
TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY
Transsphenoidal  resection  is  the  desired  surgical  approach  for 
pituitary  tumors,  except  for  the  rare  invasive  suprasellar  mass 
surrounding  the  frontal  or  middle  fossa  or  the  optic  nerves  or 
invading  posteriorly  behind  the  clivus,  which  may  require  tran-
scranial  approaches.  Intraoperative  microscopy  facilitates  visual 
distinction  between  adenomatous  and  normal  pituitary  tissue  as 
well as microdissection of small tumors that may not be visible by 
MRI (Fig. 380-3). Endoscopic techniques with three-dimensional

intraoperative localization enable better visualization and access to 
tumor tissue. Transsphenoidal surgery also avoids cranial invasion 
and  manipulation  of  brain  tissue  required  by  subfrontal  surgical 
approaches. Individual surgical experience is a major determinant 
of outcome efficacy with these techniques.

In addition to correction of hormonal hypersecretion, pituitary 
surgery  is  indicated  for  mass  lesions  that  impinge  on  surround-
ing structures. Surgical decompression and resection are required 
for  an  expanding  pituitary  mass,  which  may  be  asymptomatic 
or  accompanied  by  persistent  headache,  progressive  visual  field 
defects,  cranial  nerve  palsies,  hydrocephalus,  and,  occasionally, 
intrapituitary  hemorrhage  and  apoplexy.  Transsphenoidal  surgery 
rarely  is  used  for  pituitary  tissue  biopsy  to  establish  a  histologic 
diagnosis. Whenever possible, the pituitary mass lesion should be 
selectively excised; normal pituitary tissue should be manipulated 
or  resected  only  when  critical  for  effective  mass  dissection.  Non-
selective  hemihypophysectomy  or  total  hypophysectomy  may  be 
indicated  if  no  hypersecreting  mass  lesion  is  clearly  discernible, 
multifocal lesions are present, or the remaining nontumorous pitu-
itary tissue is obviously necrotic. This strategy, however, increases 
the  likelihood  of  postoperative  hypopituitarism  and  the  need  for 
lifelong hormone replacement.

Preoperative mass effects, including visual field defects and com-
promised pituitary function, may be reversed by surgery, particu-
larly when the deficits are not long-standing. For large and invasive 
tumors, it is necessary to determine  the  optimal balance between

maximal  tumor  resection  and  preservation  of  anterior  pituitary 
hormonal function, especially for preserving growth and reproduc-
tive function in younger patients. Tumor invasion outside the sella 
is rarely amenable to surgical cure, and the surgeon must judge the 
risk-versus-benefit ratio of extensive tumor resection. 
Side  Effects  Tumor  size,  the  degree  of  invasiveness,  and  expe-
rience  of  the  surgeon  largely  determine  the  incidence  of  surgical 
complications. Operative mortality rate is ~1%. Transient diabetes 
insipidus  and  hypopituitarism  occur  in  up  to  20%  of  patients. 
Permanent  diabetes  insipidus,  cranial  nerve  damage,  nasal  septal 
perforation,  or  visual  disturbances  may  be  encountered  in  up  to 
10% of patients. CSF leaks occur in 4% of patients. Less common 
complications include carotid artery injury, loss of vision, hypotha-
lamic damage, and meningitis. Permanent side effects are rare after 
surgery for microadenomas. 
RADIATION
Radiation  is  used  either  as  a  primary  therapy  for  pituitary  or 
parasellar masses or, more commonly, as an adjunct to surgery or 
medical  therapy.  Focused  megavoltage  irradiation  is  achieved  by 
precise  MRI  localization,  using  a  high-voltage  linear  accelerator 
and accurate isocentric rotational arcing. A major determinant of 
accurate  irradiation  is  reproduction  of  the  patient’s  head  position 
during  multiple  visits  and  maintenance  of  absolute  head  immo-
bility.  A  total  of  <50  Gy  (5000  rad)  is  given  as  180-cGy  (180-
rad)  fractions  divided  over  ~6  weeks.  Stereotactic  radiosurgery 
delivers  a  large  single  high-energy  dose  from  a  cobalt-60  source 
(Gamma Knife), linear accelerator, or cyclotron. Long-term effects 
of Gamma Knife surgery appear to be similar to those encountered 
with  conventional  radiation.  Proton  beam  therapy  is  available  in 
some  centers  and  provides  concentrated  radiation  doses  within  a 
localized region.

The  role  of  radiation  therapy  in  pituitary  tumor  management 
depends on the nature and anatomic location of the tumor, the age 
of the patient, and the availability of surgical and radiation exper-
tise. Because of its relatively slow onset of action, radiation therapy 
is usually reserved for postsurgical management. As an adjuvant to 
surgery, radiation is used to treat residual tumor in an attempt to 
prevent persistent growth or recurrence. Irradiation offers the only 
means  for  potentially  ablating  significant  postoperative  residual 
nonfunctioning tumor tissue. By contrast, PRL-, growth hormone 
(GH)–,  adrenocorticotropin  hormone  (ACTH)–,  and  thyrotropin 
(thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH])–secreting residual tumor tis-
sues are amenable to medical therapy. 
Side Effects 
In the short term, radiation may cause transient nau-
sea and weakness. Alopecia and loss of taste and smell may be more 
long-lasting. Failure of pituitary hormone synthesis is common in 
patients who have undergone head and neck or pituitary-directed 
irradiation. More than 50% of patients develop loss of GH, ACTH, 
TSH, and/or gonadotropin secretion within 10 years, usually due to 
hypothalamic  damage.  Lifelong  follow-up  with  testing  of  anterior 
pituitary  hormone  reserve  is  therefore  required  after  radiation 
treatment. Optic nerve damage with impaired vision due to optic 
neuritis is reported in ~2% of patients who undergo pituitary irradi-
ation. Cranial nerve damage is uncommon now that radiation doses 
are <2 Gy (200 rad) at any one treatment session and the maximum 
dose  is  <50  Gy  (5000  rad).  The  use  of  stereotactic  radiotherapy 
reduces  the  risk  of  damage  to  adjacent  structures.  Conventional 
radiotherapy for pituitary tumors has been associated with adverse 
mortality rates, mainly from cerebrovascular disease. The cumula-
tive risk of developing a secondary tumor after conventional radia-
tion is 1.3% after 10 years and 1.9% after 20 years. 
MEDICAL
Medical therapy for pituitary tumors is highly specific and depends 
on  tumor  type.  For  prolactinomas,  dopamine  agonists  are  the 
treatment  of  choice.  For  acromegaly,  somatostatin  receptor  lig-
ands  (SRLs)  and  a  GH  receptor  antagonist  are  indicated.  For 
TSH-secreting  tumors,  SRLs  and  occasionally  dopamine  agonists

are indicated. ACTH-secreting tumors may respond to SRLs, and 
adrenal-directed  therapy  may  also  be  of  benefit.  Nonfunctioning 
tumors  are  generally  not  responsive  to  medications  and  require 
surgery and/or irradiation.

 ■ SELLAR MASSES
Sellar masses may arise from brain, hypothalamic, or pituitary tissues. 
Each exhibit features related to the lesion location but also unique to 
the specific etiology. Unique MRI characteristics inform the differen-
tial diagnosis of pituitary masses (Fig. 380-4).

Lesions  involving  the  anterior  and  preoptic  hypothalamic  regions 
cause  paradoxical  vasoconstriction,  tachycardia,  and  hyperthermia. 
Acute  hyperthermia  usually  is  due  to  a  hemorrhagic  insult,  but 
poikilothermia  may  also  occur.  Central  disorders  of  thermoreg-
ulation  result  from  posterior  hypothalamic  damage.  The  periodic 
hypothermia  syndrome  is  characterized  by  episodic  attacks  of  rec-
tal  temperatures  <30°C  (86°F),  sweating,  vasodilation,  vomiting, 
and  bradycardia  (Chap.  464).  Damage  to  the  ventromedial  hypo-
thalamic  nuclei  by  craniopharyngiomas,  hypothalamic  trauma,  or 
inflammatory  disorders  may  be  associated  with  hyperphagia  and 
obesity.  This  region  appears  to  contain  an  energy-satiety  center 
where  melanocortin  receptors  are  influenced  by  leptin,  insulin,  pro- 
opiomelanocortin  (POMC)  products,  and  gastrointestinal  peptides  
(Chap.  401).  Polydipsia  and  hypodipsia  are  associated  with  damage 
to  central  osmoreceptors  located  in  preoptic  nuclei  (Chap.  381). 
Slow-growing  hypothalamic  lesions  can  cause  increased  somnolence 
and disturbed sleep cycles as well as obesity, hypothermia, and emo-
tional  outbursts.  Lesions  of  the  central  hypothalamus  may  stimulate 
sympathetic  neurons,  leading  to  elevated  serum  catecholamine  and 
cortisol levels. These patients are predisposed to cardiac arrhythmias, 
hypertension, and gastric erosions.

Craniopharyngiomas  are  benign,  suprasellar  cystic  masses  that 
present  with  headaches,  visual  field  deficits,  and  variable  degrees  of 
hypopituitarism. They are derived from Rathke’s pouch and arise near 
the  pituitary  stalk,  commonly  extending  into  the  suprasellar  cistern. 
Craniopharyngiomas are often large, cystic, and locally invasive. Many 
are  partially  calcified,  exhibiting  a  characteristic  appearance  on  skull 
x-ray  and  CT  images.  More  than  half  of  all  patients  present  before 
age 20, usually with signs of increased intracranial pressure, including 

headache,  vomiting,  papilledema,  and  hydrocephalus.  Associated 
symptoms  include  visual  field  abnormalities,  personality  changes 
and  cognitive  deterioration,  cranial  nerve  damage,  sleep  difficulties, 
and weight gain accompanied by features of the metabolic syndrome. 
Hypopituitarism  is  documented  in  ~90%,  and  diabetes  insipidus 
occurs  in  ~10%  of  patients.  About  half  of  affected  children  present 
with growth retardation. MRI is generally superior to CT for evaluating 
cystic structure and tissue components of craniopharyngiomas. CT is 
useful to define calcifications and evaluate invasion into surrounding 
bony structures and sinuses.

Treatment  usually  involves  transcranial  or  transsphenoidal  surgi-
cal  resection  followed  by  postoperative  radiation  of  residual  tumor. 
Surgery alone is curative in less than half of patients because of recur-
rences due to adherence to vital structures or because of small tumor 
deposits in the hypothalamus or brain parenchyma. The goal of surgery 
is to remove as much tumor as possible without risking complications 
associated with efforts to remove firmly adherent or inaccessible tissue. 
In  the  absence  of  radiotherapy,  ~75%  of  craniopharyngiomas  recur, 
and  10-year  survival  is  <50%.  In  patients  with  incomplete  resection, 
radiotherapy  improves  10-year  survival  to  70–90%  but  is  associated 
with increased risk of secondary malignancies. Most patients require 
lifelong pituitary hormone replacement. As some craniopharyngiomas 
(particularly  papillary)  are  associated  with  activated  BRAF  V600E 
mutations, use of BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) either 
alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors (trametinib or cobime-
tinib) has resulted in long-term growth responses in some patients.

Developmental  failure  of  Rathke’s  pouch  obliteration  may  lead  to 
Rathke’s cysts, which are small (<5 mm) cysts entrapped by squamous 
epithelium and are found in ~20% of individuals at autopsy. Although 
Rathke’s  cleft  cysts  do  not  usually  grow  and  are  often  diagnosed 
incidentally,  about  a  third  present  in  adulthood  with  compressive 
symptoms,  diabetes  insipidus,  and  hyperprolactinemia  due  to  stalk 
compression.  Rarely,  hydrocephalus  develops.  The  diagnosis  is  sug-
gested preoperatively by visualizing the cyst wall on MRI, which dis-
tinguishes these lesions from craniopharyngiomas. Cyst contents range 
from CSF-like fluid to mucoid material. Arachnoid cysts are rare and 
generate an MRI image that is isointense with CSF.

Sella  chordomas  usually  present  with  bony  clival  erosion,  local 
invasiveness,  and,  on  occasion,  calcification.  Normal  pituitary  tissue 
may  be  visible  on  MRI,  distinguishing  chordomas  from  aggressive

needle aspiration.

Meningiomas arising in the sellar region may be difficult to distin-
guish  from  nonfunctioning  pituitary  adenomas.  Meningiomas  typi-
cally enhance on MRI and may show evidence of calcification or bony 
erosion. Meningiomas may cause compressive symptoms.

Histiocytosis X includes a variety of syndromes associated with foci 
of  eosinophilic  granulomas.  Diabetes  insipidus,  exophthalmos,  and 
punched-out  lytic  bone  lesions  (Hand-Schüller-Christian  disease)  are 
associated with granulomatous lesions visible on MRI, as well as a char-
acteristic axillary skin rash. Rarely, the pituitary stalk may be involved.
Pituitary  metastases  occur  in  ~3%  of  cancer  patients.  Bloodborne 
metastatic deposits are found almost exclusively in the posterior pitu-
itary.  Accordingly,  diabetes  insipidus  can  be  a  presenting  feature  of 
lung, gastrointestinal, breast, and other pituitary metastases. About half 
of pituitary metastases originate from breast cancer; ~25% of patients 
with  metastatic  breast  cancer  have  such  deposits.  Rarely,  pituitary 
stalk involvement results in anterior pituitary insufficiency. The MRI 
diagnosis  of  a  metastatic  lesion  may  be  difficult  to  distinguish  from 
an aggressive pituitary adenoma; the diagnosis may require histologic 
examination of excised tumor tissue. Primary or metastatic lymphoma, 
leukemias, and plasmacytomas also occur within the sella.

Hypothalamic hamartomas and gangliocytomas may arise from astro-
cytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons with varying degrees of differen-
tiation.  These  tumors  may  overexpress  hypothalamic  neuropeptides, 
including gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), growth hormone–
releasing  hormone  (GHRH),  and  corticotropin-releasing  hormone 
(CRH).  With  GnRH-producing  tumors,  children  present  with  preco-
cious  puberty,  psychomotor  delay,  and  laughing-associated  seizures. 
Medical treatment of GnRH-producing hamartomas with long-acting 
GnRH  analogues  effectively  suppresses  gonadotropin  secretion  and 
controls  premature  pubertal  development.  Rarely,  hamartomas  also 
are  associated  with  craniofacial  abnormalities;  imperforate  anus; 
cardiac, renal, and lung disorders; and pituitary failure as features of 
Pallister-Hall syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the carboxy 
terminus of the GLI3 gene. Hypothalamic hamartomas are often con-
tiguous  with  the  pituitary,  and  preoperative  MRI  diagnosis  may  not 
be  possible.  Histologic  evidence  of  hypothalamic  neurons  in  tissue 
resected  at  transsphenoidal  surgery  may  be  the  first  indication  of  a 
primary hypothalamic lesion.

Hypothalamic gliomas and optic gliomas occur mainly in childhood 
and  usually  present  with  visual  loss.  Adults  have  more  aggressive 
tumors; about a third are associated with neurofibromatosis.

Brain  germ  cell  tumors  may  arise  within  the  sellar  region.  They 
include dysgerminomas, which frequently are associated with diabetes 
insipidus and visual loss. They rarely metastasize. Germinomas, embry-
onal  carcinomas,  teratomas,  and  choriocarcinomas  may  arise  in  the 
parasellar region and produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). 
These  germ  cell  tumors  present  with  precocious  puberty,  diabetes 
insipidus, visual field defects, and thirst disorders. Many patients are 
GH deficient with short stature.

 ■ PITUITARY ADENOMAS AND  
HYPERSECRETION SYNDROMES
Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of pituitary hormone 
hypersecretion and hyposecretion syndromes in adults. They account 
for ~15% of all intracranial neoplasms and have been identified with 
a population prevalence of ~80/100,000. At autopsy, up to one-quarter 
of all pituitary glands harbor an unsuspected microadenoma (<10 mm 
diameter). Similarly, pituitary imaging detects small clinically inappar-
ent pituitary lesions in at least 10% of individuals.

Pathogenesis  Pituitary adenomas are benign neoplasms that arise 
from one of the five anterior pituitary cell types. The clinical and bio-
chemical  phenotypes  of  pituitary  adenomas  depend  on  the  cell  type 
from  which  they  are  derived.  Thus,  tumors  arising  from  lactotrope 
(PRL), somatotrope (GH), corticotrope (ACTH), thyrotrope (TSH), or 
gonadotrope  (LH,  FSH)  cells  hypersecrete  their  respective  hormones 
(Table 380-3). Plurihormonal tumors express various combinations of

GH, PRL, TSH, ACTH, or the glycoprotein hormone α or β subunits. 
They  may  be  diagnosed  by  careful  immunocytochemistry  of  specific 
hormone and transcription factor expression or may manifest as clini-
cal syndromes that combine features of these hormonal hypersecretory 
syndromes.  Morphologically,  these  tumors  may  arise  from  a  single 
polysecreting cell type or include cells with mixed function within the 
same tumor.

Hormonally  active  tumors  are  characterized  by  autonomous  hor-
mone  secretion  with  diminished  feedback  responsiveness  to  phys-
iologic  inhibitory  pathways.  Hormone  production  does  not  always 
correlate  with  tumor  size.  Small  hormone-secreting  adenomas  may 
cause significant clinical perturbations, whereas larger adenomas that 
produce less hormone may be clinically silent and remain undiagnosed 
(if no central compressive effects occur). About one-third of all ade-
nomas are clinically nonfunctioning and produce no distinct clinical 
hypersecretory syndrome. Most of them arise from gonadotrope cells 
and  may  secrete  small  amounts  of  α-  and  β-glycoprotein  hormone 
subunits or, very rarely, intact circulating gonadotropins. True pituitary 
carcinomas with documented extracranial metastases are exceedingly 
rare.

Almost all pituitary adenomas are monoclonal in origin, implying 
the acquisition of one or more somatic mutations that confer a selec-
tive  growth  advantage.  Consistent  with  their  clonal  origin,  complete 
surgical resection of small pituitary adenomas usually cures hormone 
hypersecretion. Nevertheless, hypothalamic hormones such as GHRH 
and CRH also enhance mitotic activity of their respective pituitary tar-
get cells in addition to their role in pituitary hormone regulation. Thus, 
patients  who  harbor  rare  abdominal  or  chest  tumors  that  elaborate 
ectopic GHRH or CRH may present with somatotrope or corticotrope 
hyperplasia with GH or ACTH hypersecretion.

Several etiologic genetic events have been implicated in the develop-
ment of pituitary tumors. The pathogenesis of sporadic forms of acro-
megaly has been particularly informative as a model of tumorigenesis. 
GHRH, after binding to its G protein–coupled somatotrope receptor, 
uses cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) as a second messenger 
to  stimulate  GH  secretion  and  somatotrope  proliferation.  A  subset 
(~35%) of GH-secreting pituitary tumors contains sporadic mutations 
in Gsα. These mutations attenuate intrinsic GTPase activity, resulting 
in constitutive elevation of cyclic AMP, Pit-1 induction, and activation 
of cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), thereby pro-
moting somatotrope cell proliferation and GH secretion.

Growth  factors  may  also  promote  pituitary  tumor  proliferation. 
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is abundant in the pituitary and 
stimulates pituitary cell mitogenesis, whereas epidermal growth factor 
receptor  (EGFR)  signaling  induces  both  hormone  synthesis  and  cell 
proliferation. Mutations of USP8 may result in overexpressed EGFR in 
a subset of ACTH-secreting tumors. Other factors involved in initiation 
and  promotion  of  pituitary  tumors  include  loss  of  negative-feedback 
inhibition  (as  seen  with  primary  hypothyroidism  or  hypogonadism) 
and estrogen-mediated or paracrine angiogenesis. Growth characteris-
tics and neoplastic behavior also may be influenced by activated onco-
genes, including RAS and pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG), 
or inactivation of growth suppressor genes, including MEG3. Pituitary 
adenomas  exhibit  lineage-specific  features  of  cell-cycle  disruption, 
including cellular senescence, with chromosomal instability and copy 
number alterations as well as elevated levels of CDK inhibitors. These 
features underlie the invariably benign nature of these adenomas.

Genetic Syndromes Associated with Pituitary Tumors  Sev-
eral  familial  syndromes  are  associated  with  pituitary  tumors,  and 
the  genetic  mechanisms  for  some  of  them  have  been  unraveled  
(Table 380-4).

Multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  (MEN)  1  is  an  autosomal  dominant 
syndrome characterized primarily by a genetic predisposition to para-
thyroid,  pancreatic  islet,  and  pituitary  adenomas  (Chap.  388).  MEN 
1  is  caused  by  inactivating  germline  mutations  in  MENIN,  a  consti-
tutively  expressed  tumor-suppressor  gene  located  on  chromosome 
11q13. Loss of heterozygosity or a somatic mutation of the remaining 
normal  MENIN  allele  leads  to  tumorigenesis.  About  half  of  affected 
patients develop prolactinomas; acromegaly and Cushing’s disease are 
less commonly encountered.

Carney complex is characterized by spotty skin pigmentation, myxo-
mas, and endocrine tumors, including testicular, adrenal, and pituitary 
adenomas. Acromegaly occurs in ~20% of these patients. A subset of 
patients has mutations in the R1α regulatory subunit of protein kinase 
A (PRKAR1A).

McCune-Albright syndrome consists of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, 
pigmented skin patches, and a variety of endocrine disorders, includ-
ing acromegaly, adrenal adenomas, and autonomous ovarian function 
(Chap. 412). Hormonal hypersecretion results from constitutive cyclic 
AMP production caused by inactivation of the GTPase activity of Gsα. 
The Gsα mutations occur postzygotically, leading to a mosaic pattern 
of mutant expression.

Familial acromegaly is a rare disorder in which family members may 
manifest  either  acromegaly  or  gigantism.  A  subset  of  families  with  a 
predisposition  for  familial  pituitary  tumors,  especially  acromegaly, 

has been found to harbor germline mutations in the AIP gene, which 
encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein.

 ■ HYPERPROLACTINEMIA
Etiology  Hyperprolactinemia  is  the  most  common  pituitary  hor-
mone  hypersecretion  syndrome  in  both  men  and  women.  PRL- 
secreting  pituitary  adenomas  (prolactinomas)  are  the  most  common 
cause of PRL levels >200 μg/L (see below). Less pronounced PRL eleva-
tion can also be seen with microprolactinomas but is more commonly 
caused by drugs, pituitary stalk compression, hypothyroidism, or renal 
failure (Table 380-5).

Pregnancy  and  lactation  are  the  important  physiologic  causes  of 
hyperprolactinemia.  Sleep-associated  hyperprolactinemia  reverts  to 
normal  within  an  hour  of  awakening.  Nipple  stimulation  and  sexual 
orgasm  also  may  increase  PRL.  Chest  wall  stimulation  or  trauma 
(including chest surgery and herpes zoster) invokes the reflex suckling 
arc  with  resultant  hyperprolactinemia.  Chronic  renal  failure  elevates 
PRL  by  decreasing  peripheral  clearance.  Primary  hypothyroidism  is 
associated  with  mild  hyperprolactinemia,  probably  because  of  com-
pensatory TRH secretion. Mutation of the PRL receptor is a rare cause 
of hyperprolactinemia.

Lesions  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary  region  that  disrupt  hypo-
thalamic  dopamine  synthesis,  portal  vessel  delivery,  or  lactotrope 
responses are associated with hyperprolactinemia. Thus, hypothalamic 
tumors,  cysts,  infiltrative  disorders,  and  radiation-induced  dam-
age  cause  elevated  PRL  levels,  usually  in  the  range  of  30–100  μg/L. 
Plurihormonal  adenomas  (including  GH  and  ACTH  tumors)  may 
hypersecrete  PRL  directly.  Pituitary  masses,  including  clinically  non-
functioning pituitary tumors, may compress the pituitary stalk to cause 
hyperprolactinemia.

Drug-induced  inhibition  or  disruption  of  dopaminergic  receptor 
function  is  a  common  cause  of  hyperprolactinemia  (Table  380-5). 
Thus,  antipsychotics  and  antidepressants  are  a  relatively  common 
cause of mild hyperprolactinemia. Most patients receiving risperidone 
have elevated PRL levels, sometimes exceeding 200 μg/L. Methyldopa 
inhibits dopamine synthesis, and verapamil blocks dopamine release, 
also leading to hyperprolactinemia. Hormonal agents that induce PRL 
include estrogens and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).

Presentation  and  Diagnosis  Amenorrhea,  galactorrhea,  and 
infertility are the hallmarks of hyperprolactinemia in women. If hyper-
prolactinemia develops before menarche, primary amenorrhea results. 
More commonly, hyperprolactinemia develops later in life and leads to 
oligomenorrhea and ultimately to amenorrhea. If hyperprolactinemia 
is sustained, vertebral bone mineral density can be reduced compared 
with age-matched controls, particularly when it is associated with pro-
nounced  hypoestrogenemia.  Galactorrhea  is  present  in  up  to  80%  of 
hyperprolactinemic women. Although usually bilateral and spontane-
ous, it may be unilateral or expressed only manually. Patients also may 
complain of decreased libido, weight gain, and mild hirsutism.

In men with hyperprolactinemia, diminished libido, infertility, and 
visual  loss  (from  optic  nerve  compression)  are  the  usual  presenting 
symptoms.  Gonadotropin  suppression  leads  to  reduced  testosterone, 
impotence, and oligospermia. True galactorrhea is uncommon in men 
with  hyperprolactinemia.  If  the  disorder  is  long-standing,  secondary 
effects  of  hypogonadism  are  evident,  including  osteopenia,  reduced 
muscle mass, and decreased beard growth.

The  diagnosis  of  idiopathic  hyperprolactinemia  is  made  by  exclu-
sion of known causes of hyperprolactinemia in the setting of a normal 
pituitary  MRI.  Some  of  these  patients  may  harbor  small  microade-
nomas below visible MRI sensitivity (~2 mm).

 ■ GALACTORRHEA
Galactorrhea,  the  inappropriate  discharge  of  milk-containing  fluid 
from  the  breast,  is  considered  abnormal  if  it  persists  longer  than  
6  months  after  childbirth  or  discontinuation  of  breast-feeding.  Post-
partum  galactorrhea  associated  with  amenorrhea  is  a  self-limiting 
disorder  usually  associated  with  moderately  elevated  PRL  levels. 
Galactorrhea may occur spontaneously, or it may be elicited by nipple

of  patients.  Treatment  of  galactorrhea  usually  involves  managing  the 
underlying disorder (e.g., replacing T4 for hypothyroidism, discontinu-
ing a medication, treating prolactinoma).

Laboratory  Investigation  Basal,  fasting  morning  PRL  levels 
(normally  <20  μg/L)  should  be  measured  to  assess  hypersecretion. 
Both false-positive and false-negative results may be encountered. In 
patients  with  markedly  elevated  PRL  levels  (>1000  μg/L),  reported 
results  may  be  falsely  lowered  because  of  assay  artifacts;  sample 
dilution  is  required  to  measure  these  high  values  accurately.  Falsely 
elevated values may be caused by aggregated forms of circulating PRL, 
which  are  usually  biologically  inactive  (macroprolactinemia).  Hypo-
thyroidism should be excluded by measuring TSH and T4 levels.

TREATMENT
Hyperprolactinemia

Treatment of hyperprolactinemia depends on the cause of elevated 
PRL  levels.  Regardless  of  the  etiology,  however,  treatment  should 
be aimed at normalizing PRL levels to alleviate suppressive effects 
on gonadal function, halt galactorrhea, and preserve bone mineral 
density. Dopamine agonists are effective for most causes of hyper-
prolactinemia (see the treatment section for prolactinoma, below) 
regardless of the underlying cause.

If the patient is taking a medication known to cause hyperprolac-
tinemia, the drug should be withdrawn, if possible. For psychiatric 
patients  who  require  neuroleptic  agents,  supervised  dose  titration 
or the addition of a dopamine agonist can help restore normopro-
lactinemia  and  alleviate  reproductive  symptoms.  However,  dopa-
mine  agonists  may  worsen  the  underlying  psychiatric  condition, 
especially  at  high  doses.  Hyperprolactinemia  usually  resolves  after 
adequate thyroid hormone replacement in hypothyroid patients or 
after renal transplantation in patients undergoing dialysis. Resection 
of  hypothalamic  or  sellar  mass  lesions  can  reverse  hyperprolac-
tinemia caused by stalk compression and reduced dopamine tone. 
Granulomatous  infiltrates  occasionally  respond  to  glucocorticoid 
administration. In patients with irreversible hypothalamic damage, 
no treatment may be warranted. In up to 30% of patients with hyper-
prolactinemia—usually without a visible pituitary microadenoma—
the condition may resolve spontaneously.

 ■ PROLACTINOMA
Etiology  and  Prevalence  Tumors  arising  from  lactotrope  cells 
account for about half of all functioning pituitary tumors, with a pop-
ulation prevalence of ~10/100,000 in men and ~30/100,000 in women. 
Mixed tumors that secrete combinations of GH and PRL, ACTH and 
PRL,  and  rarely  TSH  and  PRL  are  also  seen.  These  plurihormonal 
tumors are usually  recognized by immunohistochemistry, sometimes 
without apparent clinical manifestations from the production of addi-
tional hormones. Microadenomas are classified as <1 cm in diameter 
and usually do not invade the parasellar region. Macroadenomas are 
>1 cm in diameter and may be locally invasive and impinge on adja-
cent  structures.  The  female-to-male  ratio  for  microprolactinomas  is 
20:1,  whereas  the  sex  ratio  is  near  1:1  for  macroadenomas.  Tumor 
size  generally  correlates  directly  with  PRL  concentrations;  values  
>250  μg/L  usually  are  associated  with  macroadenomas.  Men  tend  to 
present with larger tumors than women, possibly because the features 
of male hypogonadism are less readily evident. PRL levels remain stable 
in most patients, reflecting the slow growth of these tumors. About 5% 
of microadenomas progress in the long term to macroadenomas.

pressure.  In  both  men  and  women,  galactorrhea  may  vary  in  color 
and  consistency  (transparent,  milky,  or  bloody)  and  arise  either  uni-
laterally  or  bilaterally.  Mammography  or  ultrasound  is  indicated  for 
bloody  discharges  (particularly  from  a  single  nipple),  which  may  be 
caused  by  breast  cancer.  Galactorrhea  is  commonly  associated  with 
hyperprolactinemia  caused  by  any  of  the  conditions  listed  in  Table 

Presentation and Diagnosis  Women usually present with amen-
orrhea, infertility, and galactorrhea. If the tumor extends outside the 
sella, visual field defects or other mass effects may be seen. Men often 
present  with  impotence,  loss  of  libido,  infertility,  or  signs  of  central 
nervous  system  (CNS)  compression,  including  headaches  and  visual 
defects. Assuming that physiologic and medication-induced causes of

2910 hyperprolactinemia are excluded (Table 380-5), the diagnosis of pro-
lactinoma is likely with a PRL level >200 μg/L. PRL levels <100 μg/L 
may  be  caused  by  microadenomas,  other  sellar  lesions  that  decrease 
dopamine inhibition, or nonneoplastic causes of hyperprolactinemia. 
For  this  reason,  an  MRI  should  be  performed  in  all  patients  with 
hyperprolactinemia. It is important to remember that hyperprolactine-
mia caused secondarily by the mass effects of nonlactotrope lesions is 
also corrected by treatment with dopamine agonists despite failure to 
shrink the underlying mass. Consequently, PRL suppression by dopa-
mine agonists does not necessarily indicate that the underlying lesion 
is a prolactinoma.

TREATMENT
Prolactinoma

Because  microadenomas  rarely  progress  to  become  macroade-
nomas, no treatment may be needed if patients are asymptomatic 
and fertility is not desired; these patients should be monitored by 
regular serial PRL measurements and MRI scans. For symptomatic 
microadenomas, therapeutic goals include control of hyperprolac-
tinemia, reduction of tumor size, restoration of menses and fertility, 
and resolution of galactorrhea. Dopamine agonist doses should be 
titrated  to  achieve  maximal  PRL  suppression  and  restoration  of 
reproductive  function  (Fig.  380-5).  A  normalized  PRL  level  does 
not ensure reduced tumor size. However, tumor shrinkage usually is 
not seen in those who do not respond with lowered PRL levels. For 
macroadenomas,  formal  visual  field  testing  should  be  performed 
before initiating dopamine agonists. MRI and visual fields should 
be assessed at 6- to 12-month intervals until the mass shrinks and 
annually thereafter until maximum size reduction has occurred.

Oral  dopamine  agonists  (cabergoline  and  bromocriptine)  are 
the  mainstay  of  therapy  for  patients  with  micro-  or  macroprolac-
tinomas. Dopamine agonists suppress PRL secretion and synthesis 
as  well  as  lactotrope  cell  proliferation.  In  patients  with  microad-
enomas  who  have  achieved  normoprolactinemia  and  significant 
reduction  of  tumor  mass,  the  dopamine  agonist  may  be  with-
drawn after 2 years. These patients should be monitored carefully 
for  evidence  of  prolactinoma  recurrence.  About  20%  of  patients 
(especially  males)  are  resistant  to  dopaminergic  treatment;  these 
adenomas  may  exhibit  decreased  D2  dopamine  receptor  numbers 

or a postreceptor defect. D2 receptor gene mutations in the pituitary 
have not been reported. 
Cabergoline  An ergoline derivative, cabergoline is a long-acting 
dopamine  agonist  with  high  D2  receptor  affinity.  The  drug  effec-
tively  suppresses  PRL  for  >14  days  after  a  single  oral  dose  and 
induces prolactinoma shrinkage in most patients. Cabergoline (0.5–
1.0 mg twice weekly) achieves normoprolactinemia and resumption 
of  normal  gonadal  function  in  ~80%  of  patients  with  microade-
nomas; galactorrhea improves or resolves in 90% of patients. Cab-
ergoline normalizes PRL and shrinks ~70% of macroprolactinomas. 
Mass  effect  symptoms,  including  headaches  and  visual  disorders, 
usually  improve  dramatically  within  days  after  cabergoline  initi-
ation;  improvement  of  sexual  function  requires  several  weeks  of 
treatment but may occur before complete normalization of PRL lev-
els. MRI should be repeated within 16 weeks after initial therapy of 
macroadenomas as shrinkage of invasive adenomas may be striking 
(Fig. 380-6). After initial control of PRL levels has been achieved, 
cabergoline should be reduced to the lowest effective maintenance 
dose. In ~5% of treated patients harboring a microadenoma, hyper-
prolactinemia may resolve and not recur when dopamine agonists 
are discontinued after long-term treatment. Cabergoline also may 
be effective in patients resistant to bromocriptine. Adverse effects 
and  drug  intolerance  are  encountered  less  commonly  than  with 
bromocriptine. 
Bromocriptine  The  ergot  alkaloid  bromocriptine  mesylate  is  a 
dopamine receptor agonist that suppresses PRL secretion. Because 
it is short-acting, the drug is preferred when pregnancy is desired. 
Therapy  is  initiated  by  administering  a  low  bromocriptine  dose 
(0.625–1.25  mg)  at  bedtime  with  a  snack,  followed  by  gradually 
increasing the dose. Most patients are controlled with a daily dose 
of <7.5 mg (2.5 mg tid). 
SIDE EFFECTS
Side effects of dopamine agonists include constipation, nasal stuff-
iness,  dry  mouth,  nightmares,  insomnia,  and  vertigo;  decreasing 
the  dose  usually  alleviates  these  problems.  Nausea,  vomiting,  and 
postural hypotension with faintness may occur in ~25% of patients 
after the initial dose. These symptoms may persist in some patients. 
In  general,  fewer  side  effects  are  reported  with  cabergoline.  For 
the  ~15%  of  patients  who  are  intolerant  of  oral  bromocriptine,

cabergoline  may  be  better  tolerated.  Intravaginal  administration 
of  bromocriptine  is  often  efficacious  in  patients  with  intractable 
gastrointestinal side effects. Auditory hallucinations, delusions, and 
mood swings have been reported in up to 5% of patients and may 
be due to the dopamine agonist properties or to the lysergic acid 
derivative  of  the  compounds.  Rare  reports  of  leukopenia,  throm-
bocytopenia,  pleural  fibrosis,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  and  hepatitis 
have been described. Patients with Parkinson disease who receive at 
least 3 mg of cabergoline daily have been reported to be at risk for 
development of cardiac valve regurgitation. Studies analyzing >500 
prolactinoma  patients  receiving  recommended  doses  of  cabergo-
line (up to 2 mg weekly) have shown no evidence for an increased 
incidence of valvular disorders. Nevertheless, because no controlled 
prospective  studies  in  pituitary  tumor  patients  are  available,  it  is 
prudent  to  perform  echocardiograms  before  initiating  standard-
dose cabergoline therapy. 

Surgery  Rarely,  surgical  adenoma  debulking  may  be  indicated 
for  dopamine  resistance  or  intolerance  as  well  as  the  presence  of 
an  invasive  macroadenoma  with  compromised  vision  that  fails  to 
improve after drug treatment. Initial PRL normalization is achieved 

in  ~70%  of  microprolactinomas  after  surgical  resection,  but  only 
30%  of  macroadenomas  can  be  resected  successfully.  Follow-up 
studies  have  shown  that  hyperprolactinemia  recurs  in  up  to  20% 
of  patients  within  the  first  year  after  surgery;  long-term  recur-
rence rates may exceed 50% for macroadenomas. Radiotherapy for 
prolactinomas is reserved for patients with aggressive tumors that 
do not respond to maximally tolerated dopamine agonists and/or 
surgery. 
PREGNANCY
The  pituitary  increases  in  size  during  pregnancy,  reflecting  the 
stimulatory  effects  of  estrogen  and  perhaps  other  growth  factors 
on pituitary vascularity and lactotrope cell hyperplasia. About 5% 
of  microadenomas  significantly  increase  in  size,  but  15–30%  of 
macroadenomas  grow  during  pregnancy.  Bromocriptine  has  been 
used for >30 years to restore fertility in women with hyperprolac-
tinemia, without evidence of teratogenic effects. Nonetheless, most 
authorities  recommend  strategies  to  minimize  fetal  exposure  to 
the drug. For women taking bromocriptine who desire pregnancy, 
mechanical  contraception  should  be  used  through  three  regular 
menstrual cycles to allow for conception timing. When pregnancy

2912

is confirmed, bromocriptine should be discontinued and PRL levels 
followed serially, especially if headaches or visual symptoms occur. 
For women harboring macroadenomas, regular visual field testing 
is  recommended,  and  the  drug  should  be  reinstituted  if  tumor 
growth  is  apparent.  Although  pituitary  MRI  may  be  safe  during 
pregnancy,  this  procedure  should  be  reserved  for  symptomatic 
patients with severe headache and/or visual field defects. Surgical 
decompression may be indicated if vision is threatened. Although 
comprehensive  data  support  the  efficacy  and  relative  safety  of 
bromocriptine-facilitated  fertility,  patients  should  be  advised  of 
potential unknown deleterious effects and the risk of tumor growth 
during  pregnancy.  Because  cabergoline  is  long-acting  with  a  high 
D2-receptor affinity, it is not recommended for use in women when 
fertility is desired.

 ■ ACROMEGALY
Etiology  GH  hypersecretion  is  usually  the  result  of  a  somato-
trope  adenoma  but  may  rarely  be  caused  by  extrapituitary  lesions  
(Table 380-6). In addition to the more common GH-secreting soma-
totrope adenomas, mixed mammosomatotrope tumors and acidophilic 
stem  cell  adenomas  secrete  both  GH  and  PRL.  In  patients  with  aci-
dophilic stem cell adenomas, features of hyperprolactinemia (hypogo-
nadism and galactorrhea) predominate over the less clinically evident 
signs  of  acromegaly.  Occasionally,  mixed  plurihormonal  tumors  are 
encountered  that  also  secrete  ACTH,  the  glycoprotein  hormone  α 
subunit, or TSH in addition to GH. Patients with partially empty sellae 
may  present  with  GH  hypersecretion  due  to  a  small  GH-secreting 
adenoma within the compressed rim of pituitary tissue; some of these 
may  reflect  the  spontaneous  necrosis  of  tumors  that  were  previously 
larger. GH-secreting tumors rarely arise from ectopic pituitary tissue 
remnants in the nasopharynx or midline sinuses.

There are case reports of ectopic GH secretion by tumors of pan-
creatic,  ovarian,  lung,  or  hematopoietic  origin.  Rarely,  excess  GHRH 
production  may  cause  acromegaly  because  of  chronic  stimulation  of 
somatotropes. These patients present with classic features of acromeg-
aly, elevated GH levels, pituitary enlargement on MRI, and pathologic 
characteristics  of  pituitary  hyperplasia.  The  most  common  cause  of 
GHRH-mediated acromegaly is a chest or abdominal carcinoid tumor.

Although these tumors usually express positive GHRH immunoreac-
tivity, clinical features of acromegaly are evident in only a minority of 
patients  with  carcinoid  disease.  Excessive  GHRH  also  may  be  elabo-
rated by hypothalamic tumors, usually choristomas or neuromas.

Presentation and Diagnosis  Protean manifestations of GH and 
IGF-1  hypersecretion  are  indolent  and  often  are  not  clinically  diag-
nosed for 10 years or more. Acral bony overgrowth results in frontal 
bossing,  increased  hand  and  foot  size,  mandibular  enlargement  with 
prognathism,  and  widened  space  between  the  lower  incisor  teeth. 
In  children  and  adolescents,  initiation  of  GH  hypersecretion  before 
epiphyseal long bone closure is associated with development of pitu-
itary  gigantism  (Fig.  380-7).  Soft  tissue  swelling  results  in  increased 
heel  pad  thickness,  increased  shoe  or  glove  size,  ring  tightening, 
characteristic  coarse  facial  features,  and  a  large  fleshy  nose.  Other 
commonly encountered clinical features include hyperhidrosis, a deep 
and  hollow-sounding  voice,  oily  skin,  arthropathy,  kyphosis,  carpal 
tunnel  syndrome,  proximal  muscle  weakness  and  fatigue,  acanthosis 
nigricans, and skin tags. Generalized visceromegaly occurs, including 
cardiomegaly, macroglossia, and thyroid gland enlargement.

The  most  significant  clinical  impact  of  GH  excess  occurs  with 
respect  to  the  cardiovascular  system.  Cardiomyopathy  with  arrhyth-
mias,  left  ventricular  hypertrophy,  decreased  diastolic  function,  and 
hypertension  ultimately  occur  in  most  patients  if  untreated.  Upper 
airway  obstruction  with  sleep  apnea  occurs  in  >60%  of  patients  and 
is  associated  with  both  soft  tissue  laryngeal  airway  obstruction  and 
central sleep dysfunction. Diabetes mellitus develops in 25% of patients 
with acromegaly, and most patients are intolerant of a glucose load (as 
GH counteracts the action of insulin). Acromegaly is associated with 
an  increased  risk  of  colon  polyps  and  mortality  from  colonic  malig-
nancy;  polyps  are  diagnosed  in  up  to  one-third  of  patients.  Overall 
mortality is increased about threefold and is due primarily to cardio-
vascular and cerebrovascular disorders and respiratory disease. Unless 
GH levels are controlled, survival is reduced by an average of 10 years 
compared with an age-matched control population.

Laboratory  Investigation  Age-matched  serum  IGF-1  levels  are 
elevated  in  acromegaly.  Consequently,  an  IGF-1  level  provides  a 
useful  laboratory  screening  measure  when  clinical  features  raise  the 
possibility  of  acromegaly.  Owing  to  the  pulsatility  of  GH  secretion, 
measurement of a single random GH level is not useful for the diag-
nosis or exclusion of acromegaly and does not correlate with disease 
severity. The diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed by demonstrating 
the  failure  of  GH  suppression  to  <0.4  μg/L  within  1–2  h  of  an  oral 
glucose load (75 g). When ultrasensitive GH assays are used, normal 
nadir  GH  levels  are  even  lower  (<0.05  μg/L).  About  20%  of  patients 
exhibit a paradoxical GH rise after glucose. PRL should be measured, 
as it is elevated in ~25% of patients with acromegaly. Thyroid function, 
gonadotropins, and sex steroids may be attenuated because of tumor 
mass effects. Because most patients will undergo surgery with gluco-
corticoid coverage, tests of ACTH reserve in asymptomatic patients are 
more efficiently deferred until after surgery.

TREATMENT
Acromegaly

The goal of treatment is to control GH and IGF-1 hypersecretion, 
ablate  or  arrest  tumor  growth,  ameliorate  comorbidities,  restore 
mortality rates to normal, and preserve pituitary function.

Surgical resection of GH-secreting adenomas is the initial treat-
ment  for  most  patients  (Fig.  380-8).  SRLs  are  used  as  adjuvant 
treatment  for  preoperative  shrinkage  of  large  invasive  macroade-
nomas, immediate relief of debilitating symptoms, and reduction of 
GH hypersecretion; in frail patients experiencing morbidity; and in 
patients who decline surgery or when surgery fails to achieve bio-
chemical control. Irradiation or repeat surgery may be required for 
patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to adjunctive med-
ical therapy. The high rate of late hypopituitarism and the slow rate 
(5–15 years) of biochemical response are the main disadvantages of

radiotherapy. Irradiation is also relatively ineffective in normalizing 
IGF-1  levels.  Stereotactic  ablation  of  GH-secreting  adenomas  by 
Gamma  Knife  radiotherapy  is  promising,  but  long-term  results 
and side effects appear similar to those observed with conventional 
radiation. SRLs may be required while awaiting the full benefits of 
radiotherapy. Systemic comorbid sequelae of acromegaly, including 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and arthritis, should be managed 
aggressively. Mandibular surgical repair may be indicated. 
SURGERY
Transsphenoidal surgical resection by an experienced surgeon is the 
preferred  primary  treatment  for  both  microadenomas  (remission 
rate  ~70%)  and  macroadenomas  (<50%  in  remission).  Soft  tissue 
swelling  improves  immediately  after  tumor  resection.  GH  levels 
return to normal within an hour, and IGF-1 levels are normalized 
within 3–4 days. In ~10% of patients, acromegaly may recur several 
years after apparently successful surgery; hypopituitarism develops 
in up to 15% of patients after surgery. 
SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR LIGANDS
SRLs exert their therapeutic effects through SST2 and SST5 recep-
tor subtypes, both expressed by GH-secreting tumors.

The preferred medical treatments for patients with acromegaly 
include  long-acting  injectable  SRL  depot  formulations  of  octreo-
tide  and  lanreotide  as  well  as  oral  octreotide  capsules.  Although 
responses  vary  widely  in  individual  patients,  meta-analyses  indi-
cate that GH and IGF-1 levels are normalized in ~50% of patients. 
Octreotide  acetate  is  an  eight-amino-acid  synthetic  somatostatin 
analogue. In contrast to native somatostatin, the analogue is rela-
tively resistant to plasma degradation. It has a 2-h serum half-life 
and  possesses  40-fold  greater  potency  than  native  somatostatin 
to  suppress  GH.  Octreotide  LAR  is  a  sustained-release,  long- 
acting  formulation  of  octreotide  incorporated  into  microspheres 
that sustain drug levels for several weeks after intramuscular injec-
tion. GH suppression occurs for as long as 6 weeks after a 30-mg 
intramuscular injection; long-term monthly treatment sustains GH 
and  IGF-1  suppression  and  also  reduces  pituitary  tumor  size  in 

~50% of patients. Lanreotide, in a slow-release depot SRL prepara-
tion, is a cyclic somatostatin octapeptide analogue that suppresses 
GH  and  IGF-1  hypersecretion  after  a  60-mg  subcutaneous  injec-
tion.  Long-term  (every  4–6  weeks)  administration  controls  GH 
hypersecretion in about two-thirds of treated patients and improves 
patient  compliance  because  of  the  long  interval  required  between 
drug injections. Oral octreotide capsules (40–80 mg daily) maintain 
biochemical control in patients previously maintained on injectable 
formulations.  Rapid  relief  of  headache  and  soft  tissue  swelling 
occurs in ~75% of patients within days to weeks of SRL initiation. 
Most  patients  report  symptomatic  improvement,  including  ame-
lioration of headache, perspiration, obstructive apnea, and cardiac 
failure.  Pasireotide  LAR,  a  multireceptor  ligand  with  preferential 
SST5  binding  (see  below),  has  been  shown  to  exhibit  efficacy  in 
achieving biochemical control in patients resistant to octreotide or 
lanreotide preparations. 
Side  Effects  SRLs  are  well  tolerated  in  most  patients.  Adverse 
effects  are  similar  for  injectable  octreotide  and  lanreotide  as  well 
as for oral octreotide formulation. They are short-lived and mostly 
relate to drug-induced suppression of gastrointestinal motility and 
secretion. Transient nausea, abdominal discomfort, fat malabsorp-
tion,  diarrhea,  and  flatulence  occur  in  one-third  of  patients,  and 
these symptoms usually remit within 2 weeks. Gallbladder contrac-
tility  and  emptying  are  attenuated;  up  to  30%  of  patients  develop 
long-term echogenic sludge or asymptomatic cholesterol gallstones. 
Other side effects include mild glucose intolerance due to transient 
insulin suppression, asymptomatic bradycardia, hypothyroxinemia, 
and  local  injection  site  discomfort.  Pasireotide  is  associated  with 
similar gastrointestinal side effects but with a higher prevalence of 
glucose intolerance and new-onset diabetes mellitus. 

GH RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST
Pegvisomant  antagonizes  endogenous  GH  action  by  block-
ing  peripheral  GH  binding  to  its  receptor.  Consequently,  serum 
IGF-1  levels  are  suppressed,  reducing  the  deleterious  effects  of 
excess  endogenous  GH.  Pegvisomant  is  administered  by  daily

subcutaneous injection (10–30 mg) and normalizes IGF-1 in ~70% 
of patients. GH levels, however, remain elevated as the drug does 
not target the pituitary adenoma. Side effects include reversible liver 
enzyme elevation, lipodystrophy, and injection site pain. Tumor size 
should be monitored by MRI.

Combined treatment with monthly SRLs and weekly or biweekly 
pegvisomant  injections  has  been  used  effectively  in  resistant 
patients. 
DOPAMINE AGONISTS
Very high doses of cabergoline (0.5 mg/d) may achieve short-lived 
and modest GH therapeutic efficacy. Combined treatment with oct-
reotide  and  cabergoline  may  induce  additive  biochemical  control 
compared with either drug alone. 
RADIATION THERAPY
External  radiation  therapy  or  high-energy  stereotactic  techniques 
are  used  as  adjuvant  therapy  for  acromegaly.  An  advantage  of 
radiation  is  that  patient  compliance  with  long-term  treatment  is 
not required. Tumor mass is reduced, and GH levels are attenuated 
over time. However, 50% of patients require at least 8 years for GH 
levels  to  be  suppressed  to  <5  μg/L;  this  level  of  GH  reduction  is 
achieved in ~90% of patients after 18 years but represents subopti-
mal GH suppression. Patients may require interim medical therapy 
for several years before attaining maximal radiation benefits. Most 
patients  also  experience  hypothalamic-pituitary  damage,  leading 
to  gonadotropin,  ACTH,  and/or  TSH  deficiency  within  10  years 
of therapy. 

SUMMARY
Surgery  is  the  preferred  primary  treatment  for  GH-secreting 
microadenomas  (Fig.  380-8).  The  high  frequency  of  residual  GH 
hypersecretion  after  macroadenoma  resection  usually  necessitates 
adjuvant  or  primary  medical  therapy  for  these  larger  tumors. 
Patients  unable  to  receive  or  respond  to  unimodal  medical  treat-
ment may benefit from combined treatments, or they can be offered 
radiation. Very rarely, repeat surgery may be required.

 ■ CUSHING’S DISEASE (ACTH-PRODUCING 
ADENOMA)
(See also Chap. 386)

Etiology and Prevalence  Pituitary corticotrope adenomas (Cush-
ing’s disease) account for 70% of patients with endogenous causes of 
Cushing’s syndrome. However, it should be emphasized that iatrogenic 
hypercortisolism  is  the  most  common  cause  of  cushingoid  features. 
Ectopic  tumor  ACTH  production,  cortisol-producing  adrenal  ade-
nomas,  adrenal  carcinoma,  and  adrenal  hyperplasia  account  for  the 
other causes; rarely, ectopic tumor CRH production is encountered.

ACTH-producing  adenomas  account  for  ~10–15%  of  all  pituitary 
tumors.  Because  the  clinical  features  of  Cushing’s  syndrome  often 
lead  to  early  diagnosis,  most  ACTH-producing  pituitary  tumors 
are  relatively  small  microadenomas.  However,  macroadenomas  also 
are  seen  and  some  ACTH-expressing  adenomas  are  clinically  silent. 
Cushing’s disease is 5–10 times more common in women than in men. 
These pituitary adenomas exhibit unrestrained ACTH secretion, with

resultant  hypercortisolemia.  However,  they  retain  partial  suppress-
ibility in the presence of high doses of administered glucocorticoids, 
providing  the  basis  for  dynamic  testing  to  distinguish  pituitary  from 
nonpituitary causes of Cushing’s syndrome.

Presentation  and  Diagnosis  The  diagnosis  of  Cushing’s  syn-
drome  presents  two  great  challenges:  (1)  to  distinguish  patients  with 
pathologic  cortisol  excess  from  those  with  physiologic  or  other  dis-
turbances of cortisol production and (2) to determine the etiology of 
pathologic cortisol excess.

Typical features of chronic cortisol excess include thin skin, central 
obesity,  hypertension,  plethoric  moon  facies,  purple  striae  and  easy 
bruisability, glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus, gonadal dysfunc-
tion,  osteoporosis,  proximal  muscle  weakness,  signs  of  hyperandro-
genism (acne, hirsutism), and psychological disturbances (depression, 
mania,  and  psychoses)  (Table  380-7).  Hematopoietic  features  of 
hypercortisolism include leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia. 
Immune  suppression  includes  delayed  hypersensitivity  and  infection 
propensity. These protean yet commonly encountered manifestations 
of hypercortisolism make it challenging to decide which patients man-
date  formal  laboratory  evaluation.  Certain  features  make  pathologic 
causes  of  hypercortisolism  more  likely;  they  include  characteristic 
central  redistribution  of  fat,  thin  skin  with  striae  and  bruising,  and 
proximal muscle weakness. In children and young females, early oste-
oporosis may be particularly prominent. The primary cause of death 
is  cardiovascular  disease,  but  life-threatening  infections  and  risk  of 
suicide are also increased.

Rapid development of features of hypercortisolism associated with 
skin  hyperpigmentation  and  severe  myopathy  suggests  an  ectopic 
tumor source of ACTH. Hypertension, hypokalemic alkalosis, glucose 
intolerance,  and  edema  are  also  more  pronounced  in  these  patients. 
Serum potassium levels <3.3 mmol/L are evident in ~70% of patients 
with  ectopic  ACTH  secretion  but  are  seen  in  <10%  of  patients  with 
pituitary-dependent Cushing’s syndrome.

Laboratory  Investigation  The  diagnosis  of  Cushing’s  disease  is 
based on laboratory documentation of endogenous hypercortisolism. 
Measurement  of  24-h  UFC  is  a  precise  and  cost-effective  screening 
test.  Alternatively,  the  failure  to  suppress  plasma  cortisol  after  an 
overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test can be used to iden-
tify  patients  with  hypercortisolism.  As  nadir  levels  of  cortisol  occur

aACTH-independent causes of Cushing’s syndrome are diagnosed by suppressed 
ACTH levels and an adrenal mass in the setting of hypercortisolism. Iatrogenic 
Cushing’s syndrome is excluded by history.

hormone; F, female; M, male; UFC, urinary free cortisol.

at  night,  elevated  midnight  serum  or  salivary  samples  of  cortisol 
are  suggestive  of  Cushing’s  disease.  Basal  plasma  ACTH  levels  often 
distinguish  patients  with  ACTH-independent  (adrenal  or  exogenous 
glucocorticoid)  from  those  with  ACTH-dependent  (pituitary,  ecto-
pic  ACTH)  Cushing’s  syndrome.  Mean  basal  ACTH  levels  are  about 
eightfold  higher  in  patients  with  ectopic  ACTH  secretion  than  in 
those  with  pituitary  ACTH-secreting  adenomas.  However,  exten-
sive  overlap  of  ACTH  levels  in  these  two  disorders  precludes  using 
ACTH  measurements  to  make  the  distinction.  Preferably,  dynamic 
testing  based  on  differential  sensitivity  to  glucocorticoid  feedback 
or  ACTH  stimulation  in  response  to  CRH  or  cortisol  reduction  is 
used  to  distinguish  ectopic  from  pituitary  sources  of  excess  ACTH  
(Table 380-8). Very rarely, circulating CRH levels are elevated, reflect-
ing  ectopic  tumor-derived  secretion  of  CRH  and  often  ACTH.  For 
further discussion of dynamic testing for Cushing’s syndrome, see 
Chap. 386.

Most ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors are <5 mm in diameter, and 
about half are undetectable by sensitive MRI. The high prevalence of 
incidental  pituitary  microadenomas  diminishes  the  ability  to  distin-
guish ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors accurately from nonsecreting 
incidentalomas.

Inferior Petrosal Venous Sampling  Because pituitary MRI with 
gadolinium  enhancement  is  insufficiently  sensitive  to  detect  small  
(<2  mm)  pituitary  ACTH-secreting  adenomas,  bilateral  inferior  pet-
rosal sinus ACTH sampling before and after CRH administration may 
be required to distinguish these lesions from ectopic ACTH-secreting 
tumors that may have similar clinical and biochemical characteristics. 
Simultaneous assessment of ACTH in each inferior petrosal vein and in 
the peripheral circulation provides a strategy for confirming and local-
izing  pituitary  ACTH  production.  Sampling  is  performed  at  baseline 
and 2, 5, and 10 min after intravenous bovine CRH (1 μg/kg) injection.

An  increased  ratio  (>2)  of  inferior  petrosal:peripheral  vein  ACTH 
confirms  pituitary  Cushing’s  syndrome.  After  CRH  injection,  peak 
petrosal:peripheral ACTH ratios ≥3 confirm the presence of a pituitary 
ACTH-secreting tumor. The sensitivity of this test is >95%, with very 
rare false-positive results. False-negative results may be encountered in 
patients with aberrant venous drainage. Petrosal sinus catheterizations 
are technically difficult, and ~0.05% of patients develop neurovascular 
complications.  The  procedure  should  not  be  performed  in  patients 
with hypertension, in patients with known cerebrovascular disease, or 
in the presence of a well-visualized pituitary adenoma on MRI.

TREATMENT
Cushing’s Disease

Selective  transsphenoidal  resection  is  the  treatment  of  choice  for 
Cushing’s  disease  (Fig.  380-9).  The  remission  rate  for  this  proce-
dure  is  ~80%  for  microadenomas  but  <50%  for  macroadenomas. 
However, surgery is rarely successful when the adenoma is not visi-
ble on MRI. After successful tumor resection, most patients experi-
ence a postoperative period of symptomatic ACTH deficiency that 
may last up to 12 months. This usually requires low-dose cortisol 
replacement,  as  patients  experience  steroid  withdrawal  symptoms 
and  have  a  suppressed  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis.  Bio-
chemical  recurrence  occurs  in  ~5%  of  patients  in  whom  surgery 
was initially successful. As persistent hypercortisolemia may cause 
blood clotting defects, prophylactic postoperative thromboembolic 
management has been advocated for vulnerable patients.

When  initial  surgery  is  unsuccessful,  repeat  surgery  is  some-
times indicated, particularly when a pituitary source for ACTH is 
well documented. In older patients, in whom issues of growth and 
fertility are less important, hemi- or total hypophysectomy may be 
necessary  if  a  discrete  pituitary  adenoma  is  not  recognized.  Pitu-
itary irradiation may be used after unsuccessful surgery, but it cures 
only ~15% of patients. Because the effects of radiation are slow and 
only  partially  effective  in  adults,  adrenal-targeted  steroidogenic 
inhibitors  are  used  in  combination  with  pituitary  irradiation  to 
block adrenal responses to persistently high ACTH levels.

Pasireotide  LAR  10–40  mg  intramuscularly,  an  SRL  with  high 
affinity for SST5 > SST2 receptor subtypes, may control hypercor-
tisolemia  in  a  subset  of  patients  with  ACTH-secreting  pituitary 
tumors when surgery is not an option or has not been successful.

The  drug  lowers  plasma  ACTH  levels  and  normalizes  24-h  UFC 
levels in ~20% of patients, and up to 40% of patients may experience 
pituitary tumor shrinkage. Side effects are similar to those encoun-
tered for other SRLs and include transient abdominal discomfort, 
diarrhea, nausea, and gallstones (20% of patients). Notably, hyper-
glycemia and new-onset diabetes develop in up to 70% of patients, 
likely due to suppressed pancreatic secretion of insulin and incre-
tins.  Because  patients  with  hypercortisolism  are  insulin-resistant, 
hyperglycemia  should  be  rigorously  managed.  The  drug  requires 
consistent long-term administration.

Osilodrostat (2 mg twice daily titrated up to 30 mg twice daily), 
an oral 11β-hydroxylase inhibitor that blocks adrenal gland cortisol 
biosynthesis, normalized 24-h UFC in 86% of patients. Mild, mostly 
transient  gastrointestinal  symptoms  are  common.  Patients  should 
be closely monitored for development of hypocortisolism and adre-
nal  insufficiency.  Elevated  adrenal  hormone  precursors  may  lead 
to hypokalemia and hypertension. QTc prolongation and possibly 
increased tumor volume are also reported.

Ketoconazole, an imidazole derivative antimycotic agent, inhib-
its  several  P450  enzymes  and  effectively  lowers  cortisol  in  most 
patients  with  Cushing’s  disease  when  administered  twice  daily 
(600–1200  mg/d).  Elevated  hepatic  transaminases,  gynecomastia, 
impotence,  gastrointestinal  upset,  and  edema  are  common  side 
effects.

Mifepristone (300–1200 mg/d), a glucocorticoid receptor antag-
onist,  blocks  peripheral  cortisol  action  and  is  approved  to  treat 
hyperglycemia  in  Cushing’s  disease.  Because  the  drug  does  not 
target the pituitary tumor, both ACTH and cortisol levels remain 
elevated, thus obviating a reliable circulating biomarker. Side effects 
are  largely  due  to  general  antagonism  of  other  steroid  hormones 
and  include  hypokalemia,  endometrial  hyperplasia,  hypoadrenal-
ism, and hypertension.

Metyrapone (2–4 g/d) inhibits 11β-hydroxylase activity and nor-
malizes plasma cortisol in up to 75% of patients. Side effects include 
nausea and vomiting, rash, and exacerbation of acne or hirsutism. 
Mitotane (3–6 g/d orally in four divided doses) suppresses cortisol 
hypersecretion by inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase and cholesterol side-
chain cleavage enzymes and by destroying adrenocortical cells. Side 
effects  of  mitotane  include  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  dizziness, 
gynecomastia, hyperlipidemia, skin rash, and hepatic enzyme ele-
vation. It also may lead to hypoaldosteronism. Other agents include 
aminoglutethimide (250 mg tid), trilostane (200–1000 mg/d), cypro-
heptadine (24 mg/d), and IV etomidate (0.3 mg/kg per h). Glucocor-
ticoid insufficiency is a potential side effect of agents used to block 
steroidogenesis.

The  use  of  steroidogenic  inhibitors  has  decreased  the  need  for 
bilateral  adrenalectomy.  Surgical  removal  of  both  adrenal  glands 
corrects  hypercortisolism  but  may  be  associated  with  significant 
morbidity  rates  and  necessitates  permanent  glucocorticoid  and 
mineralocorticoid  replacement.  Adrenalectomy  in  the  setting  of 
residual  corticotrope  adenoma  tissue  predisposes  to  the  devel-
opment  of  Nelson’s  syndrome,  a  disorder  characterized  by  rapid 
pituitary  tumor  enlargement  and  increased  pigmentation  second-
ary  to  high  ACTH  levels.  Prophylactic  radiation  therapy  may  be 
indicated  to  prevent  the  development  of  Nelson’s  syndrome  after 
adrenalectomy.

 ■ NONFUNCTIONING AND GONADOTROPIN-
PRODUCING PITUITARY ADENOMAS
Etiology  and  Prevalence  Nonfunctioning  pituitary  adenomas 
include those that secrete little or no pituitary hormones into the sys-
temic  circulation,  as  well  as  tumors  that  produce  too  little  hormone 
to result in recognizable clinical features. They are the most common 
type of pituitary adenoma and are usually macroadenomas at the time 
of diagnosis because clinical features are not apparent until tumor mass 
effects  occur.  Based  on  immunohistochemistry,  most  clinically  non-
functioning  adenomas  can  be  shown  to  originate  from  gonadotrope 
cells or from pituitary null cells. These tumors typically produce small 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   2916

20/01/22   3:22 PM

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismamounts of intact gonadotropins (usually FSH) as well as uncombined 
α, LH β, and FSH β subunits. Tumor secretion may lead to elevated α 
and  FSH  β  subunits  and,  very  rarely,  to  increased  LH  β  subunit  lev-
els.  Some  adenomas  express  α  subunits  without  FSH  or  LH.  A  TRH 
stimulation  test  often  induces  an  atypical  increase  of  tumor-derived 
gonadotropins or subunits.

Presentation  and  Diagnosis  Clinically  nonfunctioning  tumors 
often present with optic chiasm pressure and other symptoms of local 
expansion or may be incidentally discovered on an MRI performed for 
another indication (incidentaloma). Rarely, menstrual disturbances or 
ovarian hyperstimulation occur in women with large tumors that pro-
duce FSH and LH. In these cases, ovaries may have features that resem-
ble polycystic ovarian syndrome and may produce very high levels of 
estrogen. More commonly, adenoma compression of the pituitary stalk 
or surrounding pituitary tissue leads to attenuated LH and features of 
hypogonadism. PRL levels are usually slightly increased, also because 
of stalk compression. It is important to distinguish this circumstance 
from true prolactinomas, as nonfunctioning tumors do not shrink in 
response to treatment with dopamine agonists.

Laboratory Investigation  The goal of laboratory testing in clin-
ically nonfunctioning tumors is to classify the type of tumor, identify 
hormonal markers of tumor activity, and detect possible hypopituitar-
ism. Free α subunit levels may be elevated in 10–15% of patients with 
nonfunctioning  tumors.  In  female  patients,  peri-  or  postmenopausal 
basal  FSH  concentrations  are  difficult  to  distinguish  from  tumor- 
derived FSH elevation. Premenopausal women have cycling FSH levels, 
also  preventing  clear-cut  diagnostic  distinction  from  tumor-derived 
FSH.  In  men,  gonadotropin-secreting  tumors  may  be  diagnosed 
because of slightly increased gonadotropins (FSH > LH) in the setting 
of a pituitary mass. Testosterone levels are usually low despite the nor-
mal or increased LH level, perhaps reflecting reduced LH bioactivity 
or the loss of normal LH pulsatility. Because this pattern of hormone 
test results is also seen in primary gonadal failure and, to some extent, 
with aging (Chap. 391), the finding of increased gonadotropins alone 
is insufficient for the diagnosis of a gonadotropin-secreting tumor. In 
the  majority  of  patients  with  gonadotrope  adenomas,  TRH  adminis-
tration stimulates LH β subunit secretion; this response is not seen in 
normal individuals. GnRH testing, however, is not helpful for making 
the diagnosis. For nonfunctioning and gonadotropin-secreting tumors, 
the diagnosis usually rests on immunohistochemical analyses of surgi-
cally resected tumor tissue, as the mass effects of these tumors usually 
necessitate resection.

Although  acromegaly  or  Cushing’s  disease  usually  presents  with 
unique  clinical  features,  clinically  inapparent  (silent)  somatotrope  or 
corticotrope adenomas may only be diagnosed by immunostaining of 
resected tumor tissue. These silent tumors usually grow more aggres-
sively and account for up to 20% of all nonfunctioning adenomas. If 
PRL  levels  are  <100  μg/L  in  a  patient  harboring  a  pituitary  mass,  a 
nonfunctioning  adenoma  causing  pituitary  stalk  compression  should 
be considered.

TREATMENT
Nonfunctioning and Gonadotropin-Producing 
Pituitary Adenomas

Asymptomatic  small  nonfunctioning  microadenomas  with  no 
threat to vision may be followed with regular MRI and visual field 
testing  without  immediate  intervention.  However,  for  macroade-
nomas,  transsphenoidal  surgery  is  indicated  to  reduce  tumor  size 
and  relieve  mass  effects  (Fig.  380-10).  Although  it  is  not  usually 
possible  to  remove  all  adenoma  tissue  surgically,  vision  improves 
in 70% of patients with preoperative visual field defects. Preexisting 
hypopituitarism that results from tumor mass effects may improve 
or resolve completely. Beginning ~6 months postoperatively, MRI 
scans should be performed yearly to detect tumor regrowth. Within 
5–6 years after successful surgical resection, ~15% of nonfunction-
ing tumors recur. When substantial tumor remains after transsphe-
noidal surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy may be indicated to prevent 
tumor regrowth. Radiotherapy may be deferred if no postoperative 
residual mass is evident. Nonfunctioning pituitary tumors respond 
poorly  to  dopamine  agonist  treatment,  and  SRLs  are  largely  inef-
fective for shrinking these tumors. The selective GnRH antagonist 
Nal-Glu GnRH suppresses FSH hypersecretion but has no effect on 
adenoma size.

 ■ TSH-SECRETING ADENOMAS
TSH-producing macroadenomas are very rare but are often large and 
locally invasive when they occur. Patients usually present with thyroid 
goiter and hyperthyroidism, reflecting chronic overproduction of TSH. 
Diagnosis  is  based  on  demonstrating  elevated  serum  free  T4  levels, 
inappropriately normal or high TSH secretion, and MRI evidence of a 
pituitary adenoma. Elevated free glycoprotein hormone α subunits are 
seen in many patients.

It is important to exclude other causes of inappropriate TSH secre-
tion,  such  as  resistance  to  thyroid  hormone,  an  autosomal  dominant 
disorder  caused  by  mutations  in  the  thyroid  hormone  β  receptor 
(Chap. 382). The presence of a pituitary mass and elevated β subunit 
levels  are  suggestive  of  a  TSH-secreting  tumor.  Dysalbuminemic 
hyperthyroxinemia syndromes, caused by mutations in serum thyroid 
hormone binding proteins, are also characterized by elevated thyroid 
hormone  levels,  but  with  normal  rather  than  suppressed  TSH  levels. 
Moreover, free thyroid hormone levels are normal in these disorders, 
most of which are familial.

TREATMENT
TSH-Secreting Adenomas

The initial therapeutic approach is to remove or debulk the tumor 
mass  surgically,  usually  using  a  transsphenoidal  approach.  Total 
resection is not often achieved as most of these adenomas are large 
and  locally  invasive.  Normal  circulating  thyroid  hormone  levels 
are achieved in about two-thirds of patients after surgery. Thyroid 
ablation  or  antithyroid  drugs  (methimazole  and  propylthiouracil) 
can  be  used  to  reduce  thyroid  hormone  levels.  SRL  treatment 
effectively  normalizes  TSH  and  α  subunit  hypersecretion,  shrinks 
the  tumor  mass  in  50%  of  patients,  and  improves  visual  fields  in 
75% of patients; euthyroidism is restored in most patients. Because 
SRLs  markedly  suppress  TSH,  biochemical  hypothyroidism  often 
requires  concomitant  thyroid  hormone  replacement,  which  may 
also further control tumor growth.

 ■ AGGRESSIVE ADENOMAS
Despite the rarity of malignant transformation and metastatic lesions, 
a  subset  of  pituitary  adenomas  undergoes  aggressive  local  growth 
and  central  nervous  system  invasion  with  high  Ki67  levels  (>4%). 
Silent corticotrope and somatotrope tumors, as well as prolactinomas 
occurring  in  middle-aged  men,  are  particularly  prone  to  aggressive 
growth  and  recurrence.  Patients  with  these  tumors  usually  require 
an  integrated  management  approach  including  repeat  surgeries  and 
irradiation. Temozolomide has also been used with variable responses.

381 Disorders of the 
Neurohypophysis
Gary L. Robertson, Daniel G. Bichet

The  neurohypophysis,  or  posterior  pituitary,  is  composed  of  large 
neuronal axons that originate in cell bodies in the supraoptic and para-
ventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, project through the diaphragm 
sella, and terminate as bulbous enlargements on a capillary plexus that 
drains  into  the  superior  vena  cava.  Some  of  these  neurons  produce 
arginine  vasopressin  (AVP),  also  known  as  antidiuretic  hormone; 
others  produce  oxytocin.  AVP  acts  on  the  renal  tubules  to  reduce 
water loss by concentrating the urine. Oxytocin stimulates postpartum 
milk letdown in response to suckling. A deficiency of AVP secretion 
or action causes a syndrome characterized by the production of large 
amounts  of  dilute  urine.  Excessive  or  inappropriate  AVP  production 
impairs  urinary  water  excretion  and  predisposes  to  hyponatremia  if 
water intake is not reduced in parallel with urine output.

VASOPRESSIN
 ■ SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION
AVP  is  a  nonapeptide  composed  of  a  six-member  disulfide  ring  and 
a  tripeptide  tail  (Fig.  381-1).  It  is  synthesized  via  a  polypeptide  pre-
cursor that includes AVP, neurophysin, and copeptin, all encoded by 
a  single  gene  on  chromosome  20.  After  preliminary  processing  and 
folding, the precursor is packaged in neurosecretory vesicles, where it 
is transported down the axon; further processed to AVP, neurophysin, 
and copeptin; and stored in neurosecretory vesicles until released by 
exocytosis into peripheral blood.

In healthy individuals, AVP secretion is regulated primarily by the 
“effective” osmotic pressure, which is determined largely by the plasma 
concentration of sodium and its anions. This regulation is mediated by 
specialized  cells  in  the  anteromedial  hypothalamus,  known  as  osmo-
receptors.  The  osmoreceptors  receive  blood  from  small  perforating 
branches  of  the  anterior  communicating  artery.  They  are  extremely 
sensitive to small changes in the plasma concentration of sodium and 
its  anions  but  normally  are  insensitive  to  other  naturally  occurring 
plasma solutes such as urea and glucose. This osmoregulatory system 
includes inhibitory as well as stimulatory components that function in 
concert  to  form  a  threshold,  or  set  point,  control  system.  Below  this 
threshold, plasma AVP is suppressed to levels that permit the develop-
ment of a maximum water diuresis. Above it, plasma AVP rises steeply 
in direct proportion to plasma osmolarity, quickly reaching levels suf-
ficient to produce maximum antidiuresis. The absolute levels of plasma 
osmolarity/sodium at which minimally and maximally effective levels 
of plasma AVP occur differ from person to person, apparently due to 
genetic  influences  on  the  set  and  sensitivity  of  the  system.  However, 
the average threshold, or set point, for AVP release corresponds to a 
plasma  osmolarity  and  sodium  of  ~275  mosmol/L  and  135  meq/L, 
respectively;  levels  only  2–4%  higher  normally  result  in  maximum 
antidiuresis.

The set point of the osmostat decreases ~1% during the luteal phase 
of the menstrual cycle and ~3% during pregnancy. It is also reduced

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismby a decrease in blood pressure or by volume loss of >10–20%. These 
hemodynamic influences are mediated by neuronal afferents that orig-
inate  in  transmural  pressure  receptors  of  the  heart  and  large  arteries 
and  project  via  the  vagus  and  glossopharyngeal  nerves  to  the  brain-
stem, which sends postsynaptic projections to the hypothalamus. AVP 
secretion also can be stimulated by nausea, acute hypoglycemia, glu-
cocorticoid deficiency, smoking, and, possibly, hyperangiotensinemia. 
Emetic stimuli are extremely potent since they typically elicit immedi-
ate, 50- to 100-fold increases in plasma AVP even when the nausea is 
transient and is not associated with vomiting or other symptoms. They 
appear to act via the emetic center in the medulla and can be blocked 
completely by treatment with antiemetics such as fluphenazine. There 
is no evidence that pain or other noxious stresses have any effect on 
AVP unless they elicit a vasovagal reaction with its associated nausea 
and hypotension.
 ■ ACTION
The  most  important,  if  not  the  only,  physiologic  action  of  AVP  is  to 
reduce  water  excretion  by  promoting  concentration  of  urine.  This 
antidiuretic effect is achieved primarily by increasing the hydroosmotic 
permeability of principal cells that line the distal tubule and medullary 
collecting  ducts  of  the  kidney  (Fig.  381-2).  In  the  absence  of  AVP, 
these cells are impermeable to water and reabsorb little, if any, of the 
relatively large volume of dilute filtrate that enters from the proximal 
nephron. In this condition, the rate of urine output can be as high as  
0.2  mL/kg  per  min  and  the  specific  gravity  and  osmolarity  as  low  as 
~1.000 and 50 mosmol/L, respectively. When AVP is secreted, it binds 
to  V2  receptors  on  the  basal  surface  of  principal  cells  causing  water 
channels composed of aquaporin-2 to be inserted into the apical surface 
of the cell. These channels allow water to flow passively from the lumen 
through  the  cell  down  the  osmotic  gra-
dient created by the hypertonicity of the 
renal  medulla.  The  magnitude  of  this 
antidiuretic  effect  varies  in  direct  pro-
portion to plasma AVP, the rate of solute 
excretion,  and  the  level  of  hypertonicity 
in the renal medulla. The maximum anti-
diuresis  achievable  in  healthy  humans 
occurs at plasma AVP levels in the range 
of  1  to  3  pg/mL  and  results  in  a  urine 
osmolarity  as  high  as  1200  mosmol/L 
and a rate of output as low as 0.35 mL/
min. However, maximum concentrating 
capacity  varies  considerably  depending 
on the level of hypertonicity in the renal 
medulla and that, in turn, is a function 
of the level and duration of AVP recep-
tor 2 (AVPR2)–stimulated readsorption 
of urea in the distal nephron. Hence, if 
basal AVP stimulation of AVPR2 is low 
for  any  reason  (e.g.,  a  high  basal  fluid 
intake), the rise in urine osmolarity that 
occurs  immediately  after  an  increase 
in  hormone  levels  may  be  so  blunted 
as  to  suggest  a  defect  in  antidiuretic 
function. This probably accounts for the 
shortcomings of the traditional indirect 
methods for the differential diagnosis of 
diabetes insipidus (see below).

the baroreceptor and influence sympathetic and parasympathetic out-
flows to a variety of target organs, including the heart, the peripheral 
vasculature, and the kidneys. Their role, if any, in human physiology/
pathophysiology remains to be determined.
 ■ METABOLISM
AVP distributes rapidly into a space roughly equal to the extracellular 
fluid volume. It is cleared irreversibly with a half-life (t1/2) of 10–30 min. 
Most  AVP  clearance  is  due  to  degradation  in  the  liver  and  kidneys. 
During pregnancy, the metabolic clearance of AVP is increased three- 
to fourfold due to placental production of an N-terminal peptidase.

THIRST
Because AVP cannot reduce water loss below a certain minimum level 
obligated by urinary solute load and evaporation from skin and lungs, 
a mechanism for ensuring adequate intake is essential for preventing 
dehydration. This vital function is performed by the thirst mechanism. 
Like AVP, thirst and fluid intake are regulated primarily by an osmostat 
that is situated in the anteromedial hypothalamus and is able to detect 
very  small  changes  in  the  plasma  concentration  of  sodium  and  its 
anions. The thirst osmostat appears to be “set” about 3% higher than 
the  AVP  osmostat.  This  arrangement  ensures  that  thirst,  polydipsia, 
and  dilution  of  body  fluids  do  not  occur  until  plasma  osmolarity/
sodium exceeds the defensive capacity of the antidiuretic mechanism. 
Defects in this mechanism result in hypodipsia, diverse abnormalities 
in AVP secretion, and a variety of clinical disorders of water balance 
(see  below).  The  gastrointestinal  tract  also  has  a  mechanism  that 
detects fluid intake and inhibits thirst and AVP secretion before water 
is absorbed sufficiently to lower plasma osmolarity/sodium. However, 
the  resultant  inhibition  of  thirst  and  AVP  is  transient  unless  plasma

At  high  concentrations,  AVP  also

tors  that  are  coupled  to  phospholipase

FIGURE 381-2  Antidiuretic effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the regulation of urine volume. In a typical 70-kg 
adult, the kidney filters ~180 L/d of plasma. Of this, ~144 L (80%) is reabsorbed isosmotically in the proximal tubule and 
another 8 L (4–5%) is reabsorbed without solute in the descending limb of Henle’s loop. The remainder is diluted to an 
osmolarity of ~60 mmol/kg by selective reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the ascending limb. In the absence of AVP, 
the urine issuing from the loop passes largely unmodified through the distal tubules and collecting ducts, resulting in a 
maximum water diuresis. In the presence of AVP, solute-free water is reabsorbed osmotically through the principal cells 
of the collecting ducts, resulting in the excretion of a much smaller volume of concentrated urine. This antidiuretic effect 
is mediated via a G protein–coupled V2 receptor that increases intracellular cyclic AMP, thereby inducing translocation 
of aquaporin 2 (AQP 2) water channels into the apical membrane. The resultant increase in permeability permits an 
influx of water that diffuses out of the cell through AQP 3 and AQP 4 water channels on the basal-lateral surface. The net  
rate  of  flux  across  the  cell  is  determined  by  the  number  of  AQP  2  water  channels  in  the  apical  membrane  and  the 
strength of the osmotic gradient between tubular fluid and the renal medulla. Tight junctions on the lateral surface of 
the cells serve to prevent unregulated water flow. The V2 receptors and AQP 2 are encoded by genes on chromosome 
Xq28 and 12q13, respectively.

OXYTOCIN
Oxytocin is also a nonapeptide that differs from AVP only at positions 
3 and 8 (Fig. 381-1). However, it has relatively little antidiuretic effect 
and seems to act mainly on mammary ducts to facilitate milk letdown 
during  nursing.  It  also  may  help  initiate  or  facilitate  labor  by  stimu-
lating contraction of uterine smooth muscle, but it is not clear if this 
action is physiologic or necessary for normal delivery.

DEFICIENCIES OF AVP SECRETION AND 
ACTION
 ■ DIABETES INSIPIDUS
Clinical  Characteristics  Diabetes  insipidus  (DI)  is  a  syn-
drome  characterized  by  the  excretion  of  abnormally  large  vol-
umes  of  dilute  urine.  The  24-h  urine  volume  exceeds  40  mL/
kg  body  weight,  and  the  24-h  urine  osmolarity  is  <280  mosm/L.  
The polyuria produces symptoms of urinary frequency, enuresis, and/
or nocturia. It also results in a slight rise in plasma osmolarity/sodium 
that  stimulates  thirst  and  a  commensurate  increase  in  fluid  intake 
(polydipsia).  Hence,  clinical  symptoms  and  signs  of  dehydration  are 
uncommon unless thirst and/or water intake are also impaired.

Etiology  DI  is  divided  into  four  different  types  based  on  the 
etiology.  The  most  common  is  due  to  a  primary  deficiency  of  AVP 
secretion.  It  is  referred  to  variously  as  neurohypophyseal,  neuro-
genic,  pituitary,  cranial,  or  central  DI.  It  can  be  caused  by  a  variety 
of  congenital,  acquired,  or  genetic  disorders  but  is  often  idiopathic  
(Table 381-1). Six genetic forms of pituitary DI are now known. By far, 
the most common is transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode and 
is caused by diverse mutations in the coding region of one allele of the 
AVP–neurophysin II (or AVP-NPII) gene. All the mutations alter one 
or more amino acids known to be critical for correct processing and/or 
folding of the prohormone, thus interfering with its trafficking through 
the endoplasmic reticulum. Presumably, the misfolded mutant precur-
sor accumulates and interferes with the production of AVP by the nor-
mal allele. Eventually, it destroys the magnocellular neurons in which 
it is produced since histologic studies in a few patients show fibrosis 
and a lack of AVP-containing neurons in the posterior pituitary. The 
AVP deficiency usually is not present at birth but develops gradually 
over a period of months to years, progressing from partial to severe at 
different  rates  depending  on  the  mutation  and  other  unknown  vari-
ables.  Once  established,  the  deficiency  of  AVP  is  permanent,  but  for 
unknown reasons, the DI occasionally improves or remits completely 
in late middle age. The parvocellular neurons that make AVP and the 
magnocellular  neurons  that  make  oxytocin  appear  to  be  unaffected. 
There are also rare autosomal recessive forms of pituitary DI. One is 
due to an inactivating mutation in the AVP portion of the gene that 
results in production of a biologically inactive form of AVP. Another 
is due to a large deletion that involves the majority of the AVP gene 
and regulatory sequences in the intergenic region. A third is caused by 
mutations of the WFS1 gene responsible for Wolfram’s syndrome (DI, 
diabetes  mellitus,  optic  atrophy,  and  neural  deafness  [DIDMOAD]). 
An X-linked recessive form pituitary DI linked to Xq28 also has been 
reported,  but  the  causative  gene  has  not  yet  been  identified.  Finally, 
mutations  in  the  PCSK1  gene  have  been  associated  with  severe  early 
malabsorptive  diarrhea  and  an  undefined  polyuria-polydipsia  syn-
drome developing before 5 years of age.

The  second  type  of  DI  is  due  to  a  suppression  of  AVP  secretion 
by  excessive  intake  of  fluids.  It  is  commonly  referred  to  as  primary 
polydipsia  and  can  be  subdivided  into  three  subcategories.  In  one, 
called  dipsogenic  DI,  the  excessive  fluid  intake  appears  to  be  caused 
by  inappropriate  thirst.  It  can  occur  following  head  trauma  or  in 
association with multifocal diseases of the brain such as neurosarcoid, 
tuberculous  meningitis,  and  multiple  sclerosis,  but  like  pituitary  DI, 
it is often idiopathic. The second subcategory, psychogenic polydipsia, 
is not associated with thirst, and the polydipsia seems to be a feature

iatrogenic polydipsia, is due to an increase in water intake motivated by 
a belief in its health benefits.

The third type of DI is also due to a deficiency of AVP caused by 
an  increased  rate  of  degradation  by  an  N-terminal  aminopeptidase 
produced  in  the  placenta.  It  is  referred  to  as  gestational  DI  because 
the signs and symptoms manifest during pregnancy and usually remit 
several weeks after delivery. The fourth type of DI is caused by renal 
insensitivity to the antidiuretic action of AVP. It is called nephrogenic 
DI  and  can  be  caused  by  a  drug  such  as  lithium,  a  disorder  such  as

Pathophysiology 
In  pituitary  and 
nephrogenic  DI,  the  defect  in  urine  con-
centration  results  in  a  rise  in  the  rate  of 
water excretion, a small (1–2%) decrease in 
body water, and a commensurate increase 
in plasma osmolarity/sodium, which stim-
ulates  thirst  and  a  compensatory  increase 
in water intake. The severity of the defect 
in antidiuretic  function varies significantly from patient to patient. In 
some, it is nearly complete and cannot be overcome by even an intense 
stimulus  such  as  nausea  or  severe  dehydration.  In  others,  the  defect 
in AVP secretion or action is incomplete, and a modest stimulus such 
as a few hours of fluid deprivation, smoking, or a vasovagal reaction 
is sufficient to concentrate the urine. However, even in patients with 
a  partial  defect,  the  maximum  level  of  urine  osmolarity  produced 
by  these  stimuli  is  usually  less  than  normal  partly  because  the  prior 
deficiency  in  basal  AVP  stimulation  temporarily  diminishes  renal 
concentrating  capacity.  Nevertheless,  the  underlying  cause  of  the  DI 
can be determined by analyzing the relationship of urine osmolarity to 
plasma AVP (Fig. 381-3A) and of plasma AVP to plasma osmolarity/
sodium (Fig. 381-3B).

The  pathophysiology  of  primary  polydipsia  is  the  reverse  of  that 
in pituitary and nephrogenic DI. The increase in fluid intake reduces 
plasma  osmolarity/sodium  and  AVP  secretion.  The  resultant  urinary 
dilution  produces  a  compensatory  increase  in  urinary  free-water 
excretion  that  usually  offsets  the  increase  in  intake  and  stabilizes 
plasma osmolarity/sodium at a level below basal. Thus, hyponatremia 
is uncommon unless the polydipsia is very severe or the compensatory 
water diuresis is impaired. Fluid deprivation or hypertonic saline infu-
sion produces a normal rise in plasma AVP, but the resultant increase 
in urine concentration is usually subnormal because the capacity of the 
kidney to concentrate the urine is temporarily diminished by the prior 
lack of AVP stimulation. Thus, the maximum level of urine osmolarity 
achieved is often indistinguishable from that produced by fluid depri-
vation and/or administration of antidiuretic hormone in partial pitu-
itary or partial nephrogenic DI. However, unlike the other two types of 
DI, the relationships of the rise in plasma AVP to the rise in plasma and 
urine osmolarity are both normal in primary polydipsia (Fig. 381-3).

Differential Diagnosis 
If symptoms of urinary frequency, enure-
sis, nocturia, and/or persistent thirst are present in the absence of glu-
cosuria, the possibility of DI should be evaluated by collecting a 24-h 
urine on unrestricted fluid intake. If the osmolarity is <280 mosm/L 
and the volume >50 mL/kg per day, the patient has DI and should be 
evaluated  further  to  determine  the  type.  Sometimes  the  type  can  be 
inferred  from  the  clinical  setting.  Often,  however,  this  information 
is  lacking,  ambiguous,  or  even  misleading,  and  other  approaches  to 
differential  diagnosis  are  needed.  In  the  few  patients  in  whom  basal 
plasma osmolarity and/or sodium are above the normal range, a fluid 
deprivation test is unnecessary and potentially hazardous because pri-
mary polydipsia can be excluded. Therefore, an injection of AVP (0.5 
IU) or desmopressin (2 μg) followed by a repeat measurement of urine 
osmolarity will suffice to determine if the DI is due to a severe defect 
in the secretion or action of AVP. However, if basal plasma osmolar-
ity  and  sodium  are  within  normal  limits,  as  they  usually  are,  some 
other method is needed to determine the type of DI. The traditional

approach is to stop all fluid intake for 4–6 h and closely monitor the 
changes in body weight, plasma osmolarity/sodium, and urine osmo-
larity.  If  plasma  osmolarity  and  sodium  rise  above  the  normal  range 
without concentrating the urine, primary polydipsia is excluded, and 
the effect on urine osmolarity of injecting AVP or desmopressin will 
determine if the patient has severe pituitary or severe nephrogenic DI. 
If, however, fluid deprivation results in concentration of the urine, the 
effect on urine osmolarity of injecting AVP or desmopressin does not 
distinguish  reliably  between  partial  pituitary  DI,  partial  nephrogenic 
DI,  and  primary  polydipsia  because  all  three  disorders  temporarily 
diminish renal concentrating capacity to a variable extent depending 
on the severity of the basal polyuria.

The  ambiguities  inherent  in  the  indirect  method  of  differential 
diagnosis usually can be avoided by measuring plasma AVP before and 
during 4–6 h of complete fluid deprivation and relating these values to 
the concurrent level of plasma and urine osmolarity (Fig. 381-3). This 
approach  distinguishes  reliably  between  pituitary  and  nephrogenic 
DI even when the defect in AVP secretion or action is partial. It also 
differentiates  partial  pituitary  DI  from  primary  polydipsia  if  plasma 
osmolarity  and  sodium  rise  above  the  normal  range.  However,  this 
level  of  dehydration  is  difficult  to  achieve  by  fluid  deprivation  alone 
when  urinary  concentration  occurs.  Therefore,  it  is  usually  neces-
sary to add a short infusion of 3% saline (0.1 mL/kg body weight per 
minute for 60–90 min) and repeat the measurements of plasma AVP 
when  plasma  osmolarity  and  sodium  rise  above  the  normal  range. 
This approach differentiates reliably between partial pituitary DI and 
primary polydipsia as evidenced by other findings, including MRI of 
the posterior pituitary and a properly dosed and closely monitored trial 
of antidiuretic therapy.

A simpler and less stressful but equally reliable way to differentiate 
among pituitary DI, nephrogenic DI, and primary polydipsia is to start 
by measuring basal plasma AVP and urine osmolarity under conditions 
of unrestricted fluid intake (Fig. 381-4). If AVP is normal or elevated 
(>1 pg/mL) and the concurrent urine osmolarity is low (<280 mosm/L), 
the  patient  has  nephrogenic  DI  and  the  only  additional  evaluation 
required  is  to  determine  the  cause.  If,  however,  basal  plasma  AVP 
is  low  or  undetectable  (<1  pg/mL),  nephrogenic  DI  is  very  unlikely, 
and  a  brain  MRI  can  be  performed  to  determine  if  the  hyperintense 
signal  normally  emitted  by  the  posterior  pituitary  on  T1-weighted 
images is present. Because this “bright spot” is a function of pituitary 
stores of AVP, it is almost always present in primary polydipsia but is 
abnormally small or absent in pituitary DI even when the deficiency 
in AVP is partial or due to production of a biologically inactive form 
of the hormone. The bright spot is also faint or absent in nephrogenic 
DI presumably because the chronic stimulus to AVP secretion depletes 
pituitary stores of the hormone. Therefore, MRI does not differentiate 
between pituitary and nephrogenic DI unless it reveals other pathology 
involving the gland. The other caveat is that the pituitary bright spot is

FIGURE  381-5  Effect  of  desmopressin  therapy  on  fluid  intake  (blue  bars), 
urine  output  (orange  bars),  and  plasma  osmolarity  (red  line)  in  a  patient  with 
uncomplicated  pituitary  diabetes  insipidus.  Note  that  treatment  rapidly  reduces 
fluid intake and urine output to normal, with only a slight increase in body water as 
evidenced by the slight decrease in plasma osmolarity.

FIGURE  381-4  Simplified  approach  to  the  differential  diagnosis  of  diabetes 
insipidus.  When  symptoms  suggest  diabetes  insipidus  (DI),  the  syndrome  should 
be  differentiated  from  a  genitourinary  (GU)  abnormality  by  measuring  the  24-h 
urine volume and osmolarity on unrestricted fluid intake. If DI is confirmed, basal 
plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) should be measured on unrestricted fluid intake. 
If AVP is normal or elevated (>1 pg/mL), the patient probably has nephrogenic DI. 
However, if plasma AVP is low or undetectable, the patient has either pituitary DI 
or primary polydipsia. In that case, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain 
can  be  performed  to  differentiate  between  these  two  conditions  by  determining 
whether or not the normal posterior pituitary bright spot is visible on T1-weighted 
midsagittal images. In addition, the MRI anatomy of the pituitary hypothalamic area 
can be examined to look for evidence of pathology that sometimes causes pituitary 
DI or the dipsogenic form of primary polydipsia. MRI is not reliable for differential 
diagnosis unless nephrogenic DI has been excluded because the bright spot is also 
absent, small, or faint in this condition.

also absent in patients with empty sella even in the absence of any type 
of DI and is sometimes present in infants in the early stages of familial 
pituitary DI.

If  MRI  and/or  AVP  assays  with  the  requisite  sensitivity  and  spec-
ificity  are  unavailable  and  a  fluid  deprivation  test  is  impractical  or 
undesirable,  a  third  way  to  differentiate  among  pituitary  DI,  neph-
rogenic  DI,  and  primary  polydipsia  is  a  properly  dosed  and  closely 
monitored  trial  of  desmopressin  therapy  (see  below).  In  nephrogenic 
DI, this treatment has no effect on urine output, fluid intake, or plasma 
osmolarity/sodium. In pituitary DI, it abolishes the polyuria and poly-
dipsia  and  reduces  plasma  osmolarity/sodium  by  1–2%.  However,  in 
primary  polydipsia,  antidiuretic  therapy  eliminates  the  polyuria  but 
not the polydipsia and, as a consequence, produces moderate to severe 
hyponatremia within 8–24 h.

The measurement of plasma copeptin has also been advocated for 
the differential diagnosis of DI since it is synthesized and co-secreted 
with  AVP.  However,  because  copeptin  is  cleared  from  plasma  more 
slowly  than  AVP,  its  relationship  to  plasma  and  urine  osmolarity  is 
not diagnostic, and another approach based on the change in plasma 
copeptin  after  an  infusion  of  hypertonic  saline  has  been  reported. 
However,  unlike  the  measurement  of  plasma  AVP,  the  diagnoses 
obtained by the copeptin method do not correlate well with the MRI 
findings or the response to antidiuretic therapy. The reason for these 
disparities remains to be determined.

TREATMENT
Diabetes Insipidus

The  signs  and  symptoms  of  uncomplicated  pituitary  DI  can  be 
eliminated  by  treatment  with  desmopressin  (DDAVP),  a  syn-
thetic analogue of AVP (Fig. 381-1). DDAVP acts selectively at V2 

receptors to increase urine concentration and decrease urine flow 
in a dose-dependent manner. It is also more resistant to degrada-
tion  than  is  AVP  and  has  a  three-  to  fourfold  longer  duration  of 
action. DDAVP can be given by IV or SC injection, nasal inhala-
tion, or orally by means of a tablet or melt. The doses required to 
control pituitary DI vary depending on the patient and the route of 
administration.  However,  among  adults,  they  usually  range  from   
1–2 μg qd or bid by injection, 10–20 μg bid or tid by nasal spray, 
or 100–400 μg bid or tid orally. The onset of antidiuresis is rapid, 
ranging from as little as 15 min after injection to 60 min after oral 
administration. When given in a dose that normalizes 24-h urinary 
osmolarity  (400–800  mosmol/L)  and  volume  (15–30  mL/kg  body 
weight), DDAVP produces a slight increase in total body water and 
a (1–2%) decrease in plasma osmolarity/sodium that rapidly elim-
inates thirst and polydipsia (Fig. 381-5). Consequently, water bal-
ance is maintained within the normal range. Hyponatremia rarely 
develops unless urine volume is reduced to <10 mL/kg per day or 
fluid intake is excessive due to an associated abnormality in thirst 
or  cognition.  Fortunately,  thirst  abnormalities  are  rare,  and  if  the 
patient learns to drink only when truly thirsty, DDAVP can be given 
safely  in  doses  sufficient  to  normalize  urine  output  without  the 
need for allowing intermittent escape to prevent water intoxication.
Primary  polydipsia  cannot  be  treated  safely  with  DDAVP  or 
any other antidiuretic drug because eliminating the polyuria does 
not  eliminate  the  urge  to  drink.  Therefore,  it  invariably  produces 
hyponatremia  and/or  other  signs  of  water  intoxication,  usually 
within  8–24  h  if  urine  output  is  normalized  completely.  There  is 
no consistently effective way to correct dipsogenic or psychogenic 
polydipsia, but the iatrogenic form may respond to patient educa-
tion. To minimize the risk of water intoxication, all patients should 
be warned about the use of other drugs such as thiazide diuretics or 
carbamazepine (Tegretol) that can impair urinary free-water excre-
tion directly or indirectly.

The polyuria and polydipsia of nephrogenic DI are not affected 
by treatment with standard doses of DDAVP. If resistance is partial, 
it may be overcome by tenfold higher doses, but this treatment is too 
expensive and inconvenient for long-term use. However, treatment 
with conventional doses of a thiazide diuretic and/or amiloride in 
conjunction with a low-sodium diet and a prostaglandin synthesis 
inhibitor  (e.g.,  indomethacin)  usually  reduces  the  polyuria  and 
polydipsia  by  30–70%  and  may  eliminate  them  completely.  Side 
effects such as hypokalemia and gastric irritation can be minimized 
by  the  use  of  amiloride  or  potassium  supplements  and  by  taking 
medications with meals.

 ■ HYPODIPSIC HYPERNATREMIA
An  increase  in  plasma  osmolarity/sodium  above  the  normal  range 
(hypertonic  hypernatremia)  can  be  due  to  a  decrease  in  total  body 
water or an increase in total body sodium. The former results from a 
failure to drink enough water to replace normal or increased urinary 
and insensible loss due either to water deprivation or a lack of thirst 
(hypodipsia). This chapter focuses on hypodipsic hypernatremia, the 
form  of  hypernatremia  due  to  a  primary  defect  in  the  thirst  mecha-
nism.  Hypernatremia  caused  by  an  increase  in  total  body  sodium  is 
described elsewhere (Chap. 386).

Clinical  Characteristics  Hypodipsic  hypernatremia  is  a  syn-
drome characterized by chronic or recurrent hypertonic dehydration. 
The  hypernatremia  varies  widely  in  severity  and  is  often  associated 
with signs of hypovolemia such as tachycardia, postural hypotension, 
azotemia, hyperuricemia, and hypokalemia due to secondary hyperal-
dosteronism. Muscle weakness, pain, rhabdomyolysis, hyperglycemia, 
hyperlipidemia,  and  acute  renal  failure  may  also  occur.  Obtundation 
or coma may be present. At presentation, plasma AVP is usually but 
not  always  subnormal  relative  to  the  concurrent  hypernatremia/ 
hyperosmolemia. DI is usually absent but may develop during rehydra-
tion as blood volume, blood pressure, and plasma osmolarity/sodium 
return toward normal.

Etiology  Hypodipsia  is  usually  due  to  hypogenesis  or  destruction 
of the osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus that regulate thirst. 
The defect can result from various congenital malformations of mid-
line brain structures or may be acquired due to diseases such as sur-
gery or aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery, primary or 
metastatic tumors in the hypothalamus, head trauma, granulomatous 
diseases such as sarcoidosis and histiocytosis, AIDS, and cytomegalo-
virus encephalitis. Adipsic hypernatremia without demonstrable hypo-
thalamic lesions has also been associated with autoantibodies directed 
against the subfornical organ. Episodes of transient hypodipsic hyper-
natremia  have  also  been  reported  in  association  with  depression  or 
other psychological disorders, suggesting that reversible neurochemi-
cal defects in the osmoregulation of thirst can also occur.

Pathophysiology  A  deficiency  in  osmotically  induced  thirst 
results in a failure to drink enough water to replenish obligatory renal 
and  extrarenal  losses.  Consequently,  plasma  osmolarity  and  sodium 
rise often to extremely high levels before the disorder is recognized. In 
most cases, plasma AVP is subnormal relative to the hyperosmolarity/
hypernatremia, but it is still adequate to prevent DI. However, during 
rehydration,  plasma  AVP  sometimes  falls  to  levels  that  result  in  DI 
before the dehydration is fully corrected (Fig. 381-6). In other cases, 
plasma AVP does not decline even when the patient is overhydrated 
and  a  hyponatremic  syndrome  indistinguishable  from  inappropriate 
antidiuresis  develops.  This  suggests  that  the  AVP  osmoreceptors 
normally provide inhibitory as well as stimulatory input to the neu-
rohypophysis.  In  both  situations,  AVP  secretion  responds  normally 
to nonosmotic stimuli such as nausea, hypovolemia, or hypotension, 
indicating that the neurohypophysis is intact. In a few patients, how-
ever, the neurohypophysis is also destroyed, resulting in a combination 
of  chronic  pituitary  DI  and  hypodipsia,  a  life-threatening  disorder 
that  can  be  very  difficult  to  manage.  Rarely,  the  regulation  of  AVP 
secretion is completely normal, suggesting that the lack of thirst is due 
to a defect in post-osmoreceptor neural pathways to higher cognitive 
centers.

Differential Diagnosis  Hypodipsic hypernatremia usually can be 
distinguished from other causes of inadequate fluid intake (e.g., coma, 
paralysis, restraints, absence of fresh water) by the clinical history and 
setting. Previous episodes and/or denial of thirst and failure to drink 
spontaneously when the patient is conscious, unrestrained, and hyper-
natremic are virtually diagnostic. The hypernatremia caused by exces-
sive retention or intake of sodium can be distinguished by the presence 
of thirst as well as the physical and laboratory signs of hypervolemia 
rather than hypovolemia.

TREATMENT
Hypodipsic Hypernatremia

*) by the formula SNa

Hypodipsic hypernatremia can be corrected by administering water 
orally if the patient is alert and cooperative or by infusing hypotonic 
fluids (0.45% saline or 5% dextrose and water) if the patient is not. 
The  amount  of  free  water  in  liters  required  to  correct  the  deficit 
(ΔFW)  can  be  estimated  from  body  weight  in  kg  (BW)  and  the 
serum sodium concentration in mmol/L (SNa) by the formula ΔFW =  
0.5BW × ([SNa – 140]/140). If serum glucose (SGlu) is elevated, the 
* = SNa +  
measured SNa should be corrected (SNa
([SGlu  –  90]/36).  This  amount  plus  an  allowance  for  continuing 
insensible  and  urinary  losses  should  be  given  over  a  24-  to  48-h 
period. Close monitoring of serum sodium as well as fluid intake 
and urinary output is essential because, depending on the extent of 
osmoreceptor deficiency, some patients will develop AVP-deficient 
DI, requiring DDAVP therapy to complete rehydration; others will 
develop hyponatremia and a syndrome of inappropriate antidiure-
sis  (SIAD)-like  picture  if  overhydrated.  If  hyperglycemia  and/or 
hypokalemia  are  present,  insulin  and/or  potassium  supplements 
should be given with the expectation that both can be discontinued 
when  rehydration  is  complete.  Plasma  urea/creatinine  should  be 
monitored closely for signs of acute renal failure caused by rhabdo-
myolysis, hypovolemia, and hypotension.

Once the patient has been rehydrated, an MRI of the brain and 
tests of anterior pituitary function should be performed to look for

the  cause  and  collateral  defects  in  other  hypothalamic  functions. 
A long-term management plan to prevent or minimize recurrence 
of  the  fluid  and  electrolyte  imbalance  also  should  be  developed. 
This should include a practical method to regulate fluid intake in 
accordance with variations in water balance as indicated by changes 
in body weight or serum sodium determined by home monitoring 
analyzers. Prescribing a fixed fluid intake is often problematic and 
potentially dangerous because insensible as well as urinary loss var-
ies significantly over time due to changes in ambient temperature 
and physical activity as well as diet and antidiuresis.

 ■ INAPPROPRIATE ANTIDIURESIS  
(SEE ALSO CHAP. 53)
Clinical  Characteristics  SIAD 
is  characterized  by  hypo- 
osmolemic hyponatremia and impaired urinary dilution in the absence 
of  hypovolemia,  hypotension,  or  other  nonosmotic  stimuli  to  AVP 
secretion.  If  the  hyponatremia  develops  gradually  or  exists  for  more 
than  a  few  days,  it  may  be  largely  asymptomatic.  However,  if  the 
hyponatremia  is  severe  or  develops  acutely,  it  can  cause  a  variety  of 
adverse  symptoms  and  signs  ranging  from  headache,  confusion,  and 
anorexia to nausea, vomiting, coma, and convulsions. SIAD occurs in 
many diverse clinical settings (Table 381-2).

Etiology  The  cause  of  SIAD  is  a  failure  to  maximally  dilute  the 
urine  and  mount  a  water  diuresis  when  total  water  intake  exceeds 
urinary and insensible water loss. In most cases, the defect in urinary 
dilution is due to an abnormality in AVP secretion and is commonly 
referred  to  as  the  syndrome  of  inappropriate  antidiuretic  hormone 
(SIADH). The defect in the osmoregulation of AVP secretion can take 
any of several different forms (Fig. 381-6). The most common is one 
in which the AVP secretion responds normally to osmotic stimulation 
and suppression but the threshold or set point of the system is lower 
than  normal.  These  patients  are  able  to  dilute  their  urine  if  plasma

osmolarity/sodium is reduced below the abnormal set point. In others, 
the secretion of AVP appears to be fixed or totally erratic. In ~10% of 
cases, there is no demonstrable defect in the osmoregulation of AVP 
secretion, and the failure to maximally dilute the urine may be due to 
an abnormality in the kidney. This form may be referred to as neph-
rogenic  SIAD  (NSIAD).  In  some  of  these  patients,  the  inappropriate 
antidiuresis has been traced to a constitutive activating mutation of the 
V2 receptor gene or the stimulatory G alpha protein GNAS. This form 
of inappropriate antidiuresis may be referred to as familial NSIAD.

Pathophysiology 
In  SIADH  and  NSIAD,  the  failure  to  mount  a 
water diuresis when intake exceeds urinary and insensible loss results 
in a slight expansion of total body water followed by a modest increase 
in  urinary  sodium  excretion  due  at  least  in  part  to  suppression  of 
plasma renin activity and aldosterone secretion. As a result, expansion 
of  extracellular  volume  is  minimal,  and  clinically  detectable  edema 
does not develop. However, intracellular volume increases in propor-
tion to the severity and rapidity of the change in plasma sodium. In the 
brain, this cellular swelling causes an increase in pressure that triggers 
a variety of symptoms. After several days, the swelling and symptoms 
may subside due to inactivation of some intracellular solutes and resul-
tant decrease in cellular volume.

Differential Diagnosis  SIADH and NSIAD must be differentiated 
from  other  types  of  hypo-osmolemic  hyponatremia  associated  with 
impaired  urinary  dilution.  This  is  usually  possible  from  the  history, 
physical  examination,  and  basic  laboratory  findings  (Table  381-3). 
Hypervolemic  hyponatremia  (type  I)  typically  occurs  in  patients 
with  generalized  edema  due  to  severe  congestive  heart  failure  or 
cirrhosis.  Plasma  renin  activity  (PRA)  and  aldosterone  are  elevated. 
Hypovolemic  hyponatremia  (type  II)  occurs  in  patients  with  loss 
of  sodium  and  water  due  to  severe  vomiting,  diarrhea,  or  primary 
adrenal insufficiency. It is usually associated with hypotension in the 
recumbent  or  upright  position  and  an  elevation  in  PRA.  Euvolemic 
hyponatremia  (type  III)  is  divisible  into  two  groups,  which  need  to 
be managed differently. In one group, the cause is a severe deficiency 
in cortisol or thyroxine and should be treated accordingly. The other 
group is composed of patients with SIADH and NSIAD. In both, edema 
and  a  history  or  signs  of  sodium  and  water  loss  are  absent,  urinary 
sodium may be slightly elevated, and PRA is often low. Measurement 
of plasma AVP is usually of little diagnostic value except to differen-
tiate  SIADH  from  NSIAD  in  children  or  families  with  two  or  more 
affected members. If it is undetectable, sequencing of the AVPR2 gene 
is indicated.

TREATMENT
Inappropriate Antidiuresis

The  management  of  hyponatremia  differs  depending  on  the  type 
as well as the severity and duration of symptoms. In hypervolemic 
hyponatremia, the objective should be to reduce total body sodium 
and water. If the hyponatremia is mild and symptomatic, restricting 
daily  fluid  intake  to  less  than  total  urinary  and  insensible  water 
loss  usually  suffices  to  prevent  progression  and  gradually  cor-
rect  the  defect.  However,  if  basal  urine  output  is  very  low  or  the 
hyponatremia  is  severe  and/or  symptomatic,  an  AVP  antagonist 
such as tolvaptan or conivaptan can be given to increase the rate of 
urinary water excretion (see below). Their use should be limited to  
30  days  at  a  time  because  longer  periods  may  cause  or  worsen 
abnormal  liver  chemistries.  Infusion  of  hypertonic  saline  is  abso-
lutely  contraindicated  in  hypervolemic  hyponatremia  because  it 
further increases total body sodium and water, worsens the edema, 
and may precipitate cardiovascular decompensation.

In hypovolemic hyponatremia, fluid restriction and inhibitors of 
AVP action are absolutely contraindicated because they aggravate 
the  hypovolemia  and  could  precipitate  hemodynamic  collapse. 
Instead,  an  effort  should  be  made  to  stop  the  loss  of  sodium 
and  water  and  replace  the  deficits  by  mouth  or  infusion  of  iso-
tonic  or  hypertonic  saline.  As  in  the  treatment  of  other  forms  of

aPostural hypotension may occur in secondary (ACTH-dependent) adrenal insufficiency even though extracellular fluid volume and aldosterone are usually normal. bSerum 
potassium may be high if hypovolemia is due to aldosterone deficiency. cSerum potassium may be low if vomiting causes alkalosis. dSerum cortisol is low if hypovolemia 
is due to primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease). eSerum cortisol will be normal or high if the cause is nausea and vomiting rather than secondary (ACTH-
dependent) adrenal insufficiency. fPlasma renin activity may be high if the cause is secondary (ACTH) adrenal insufficiency. gUrinary sodium should be expressed as the 
rate of excretion rather than the concentration. In a hyponatremic adult, an excretion rate >25 meq/d (or 25 μeq/mg of creatinine) could be considered high. hThe rate 
of urinary sodium excretion may be high if the hypovolemia is due to diuretic abuse, primary adrenal insufficiency, or other causes of renal sodium wasting. iThe rate of 
urinary sodium excretion may be low if intake is curtailed by symptoms or treatment.

hyponatremia,  care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  plasma  sodium 
does not increase too rapidly or too far since doing so may produce 
osmotic demyelination in the brain.

In  euvolemic  hyponatremia,  the  treatment  of  choice  depends 
on the cause. If it is a deficiency in cortisol or thyroxine, gradual 
replacement usually suffices to eliminate all signs and symptoms, 
including  the  hyponatremia.  In  SIADH,  the  excess  body  water 
should  be  eliminated.  If  the  hyponatremia  is  mild  and  largely 
asymptomatic, restricting total water intake to ~30 mL/kg per day 
less than urine output for several days or until the syndrome remits 
spontaneously will usually suffice. If, however, the hyponatremia 
is severe and symptomatic, the goal should be to partially correct 
it  by  intravenous  infusion  of  hypertonic  (3%)  saline  or  admin-
istration  of  an  AVP  antagonist  such  as  tolvaptan  or  conivaptan   
(Fig. 381-7). Infusion of 3% saline at a rate of ~0.05 mL/kg body 
weight per min raises serum sodium at a rate of ~1–2 meq/L per h, 
not only by replacing the slight sodium deficit but also by promot-
ing a solute diuresis, which reduces total body water. Alternatively, 
a  vaptan  can  be  used  to  reduce  body  water  by  increasing  urine 
output. Tolvaptan should be started at a dose of 15 mg PO qd and 
increased to 30 mg and 60 mg as needed to produce a brisk water 
diuresis.  Conivaptan  can  be  given  intravenously  starting  with  a 
loading dose of 20 mg over 30 min followed by another 20 mg IV 
over  24  h.  With  either  vaptan,  fluid  intake  should  be  monitored 
and  restricted  so  as  to  underreplace  urine  output  by  ~5  mL/kg 
body  weight  per  h.  With  hypertonic  saline  or  vaptan  therapy, 
plasma osmolarity and/or sodium should be checked every 1–2 h, 
and water intake or the treatment should be adjusted to keep the 
rate of rise at ~1% an hour until the values reach ~270 mosm/L or 
130 meq/L, at which point the treatment should be discontinued. 
Raising the plasma sodium faster or farther may increase the risk 
of central pontine myelinolysis, an acute, potentially fatal neuro-
logic syndrome characterized by quadriparesis, ataxia, and abnor-
mal extraocular movements.

In  SIAD  due  to  an  activating  mutation  of  the  V2  receptor,  the 
V2  antagonists  may  not  block  the  antidiuresis  or  raise  plasma   
osmolarity/sodium.  In  that  condition,  use  of  an  osmotic  diuretic 
such as urea is reported to be effective in long-term prevention or 

correction of hyponatremia. However, some vaptans may be effec-
tive in patients with a different type of activating mutation of the V2 
receptor, so the response to this therapy may be neither predictable 
nor diagnostic.

 ■ GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES
The  incidence,  clinical  characteristics,  etiology,  pathophysiology,  dif-
ferential diagnosis, and treatments of fluid and electrolyte disorders in 
tropical and nonindustrialized countries differ in some respects from 
those in the United States and other industrialized parts of the world.

2926 Hyponatremia, for example, appears to be more common and is more 
likely to be due to infectious diseases such as cholera, shigellosis, and 
other  diarrheal  disorders.  In  these  circumstances,  hyponatremia  is 
probably due to gastrointestinal losses of salt and water (hypovolemia 
type II), but other abnormalities, including undefined infectious tox-
ins, also may contribute. The causes of DI are similar worldwide except 
that  malaria  and  venoms  from  snake  or  insect  bites  are  much  more 
common in some tropical climates.

382 Thyroid Gland  

Physiology and Testing
J. Larry Jameson, Susan J. Mandel,  
Anthony P. Weetman

The thyroid gland produces two related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and 
triiodothyronine  (T3)  (Fig.  382-1).  Acting  through  thyroid  hormone 
receptors (TR) α and β, these hormones play a critical role in cell dif-
ferentiation and organogenesis during development and help maintain 
thermogenic  and  metabolic  homeostasis  in  the  adult.  Autoimmune 
disorders of the thyroid gland can stimulate overproduction of thyroid 
hormones (thyrotoxicosis) or cause glandular destruction and hormone 
deficiency  (hypothyroidism).  Benign  nodules  and  various  forms  of 
thyroid  cancer  are  relatively  common  and  amenable  to  detection  by 
physical examination, ultrasound, and other imaging techniques.

ANATOMY AND DEVELOPMENT
The thyroid (Greek thyreos, shield, plus eidos, form) consists of two lobes 
connected by an isthmus. It is located anterior to the trachea between 
the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch. The normal thyroid is 
12–20 g in size, highly vascular, and soft in consistency. Four parathyroid 
glands, which produce parathyroid hormone (Chap. 410), are located 
posterior  to  each  pole  of  the  thyroid.  The  recurrent  laryngeal  nerves 
traverse the lateral borders of the thyroid gland and must be identified 
during thyroid surgery to avoid injury and vocal cord paralysis.

The thyroid gland develops from the floor of the primitive pharynx 
during  the  third  week  of  gestation.  The  developing  gland  migrates 
along the thyroglossal duct to reach its final location in the neck. This 
feature  accounts  for  the  rare  ectopic  location  of  thyroid  tissue  at  the 
base of the tongue (lingual thyroid) as well as the occurrence of thy-
roglossal duct cysts along this developmental tract. Thyroid hormone 
synthesis begins at about 11 weeks’ gestation.

Neural crest derivatives from the ultimobranchial body give rise to 
thyroid medullary C cells that produce calcitonin, a calcium-lowering 
hormone. The C cells are interspersed throughout the thyroid gland, 
although their density is greatest in the juncture of the upper one-third 
and lower two-thirds of the gland. Calcitonin plays a minimal role in 
calcium homeostasis in humans, but the C cells are important because 
of their involvement in medullary thyroid cancer.

Thyroid gland development is orchestrated by the coordinated expres-
sion  of  several  developmental  transcription  factors.  Thyroid  transcrip-
tion factor (TTF)-1, TTF-2, NKX2-1, and paired homeobox-8 (PAX-8) 
are  expressed  selectively,  but  not  exclusively,  in  the  thyroid  gland.  In 
combination,  they  dictate  thyroid  cell  development  and  the  induction 
of thyroid-specific genes such as thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid peroxidase 
(TPO), the sodium iodide symporter (Na+/I–, NIS), and the thyroid-stim-
ulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSH-R). Mutations in these develop-
mental  transcription  factors  or  their  downstream  target  genes  are  rare 
causes of thyroid agenesis or dyshormonogenesis, although the causes of 
most forms of congenital hypothyroidism remain unknown (see Chap. 
383, Table 383-1). Because congenital hypothyroidism occurs in ~1 in 
4000 newborns, neonatal screening is now performed in most industri-
alized  countries.  Transplacental  passage  of  maternal  thyroid  hormone 
occurs  before  the  fetal  thyroid  gland  begins  to  function  and  provides 
significant hormone support to a fetus with congenital hypothyroidism. 
Early thyroid hormone replacement in newborns with congenital hypo-
thyroidism prevents potentially severe developmental abnormalities.

The thyroid gland consists of numerous spherical follicles composed 
of  thyroid  follicular  cells  that  surround  secreted  colloid,  a  protein-
aceous  fluid  containing  large  amounts  of  thyroglobulin,  the  protein 
precursor of thyroid hormones (Fig. 382-2). The thyroid follicular cells 
are  polarized—the  basolateral  surface  is  apposed  to  the  bloodstream 
and an apical surface faces the follicular lumen. Increased demand for 
thyroid hormone is regulated by TSH, which binds to its receptor on 
the basolateral surface of the follicular cells. This binding 
leads  to  Tg  reabsorption  from  the  follicular  lumen  and 
proteolysis  within  the  cytoplasm,  yielding  thyroid  hor-
mones for secretion into the bloodstream.
REGULATION OF THE THYROID 
AXIS
TSH, secreted by the thyrotrope cells of the anterior pitu-
itary, plays a pivotal role in control of the thyroid axis and 
serves  as  the  most  useful  physiologic  marker  of  thyroid 
hormone action. TSH is a 31-kDa hormone composed of 
α and β subunits; the α subunit is common to the other 
glycoprotein  hormones  (luteinizing  hormone,  follicle-
stimulating  hormone,  human  chorionic  gonadotropin 
[hCG]),  whereas  the  TSH  β  subunit  is  unique  to  TSH. 
The  extent  and  nature  of  carbohydrate  modification  are 
modulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and 
influence the biologic activity of the hormone.

thyroid  hormone  synthesis  and  secretion.  Thyroid  hormones  act  via 
negative  feedback  predominantly  through  thyroid  hormone  receptor 
β2 (TRβ2) to inhibit TRH and TSH production (Fig. 382-2). The “set 
point” in this axis is established by TSH. TRH is the major positive reg-
ulator of TSH synthesis and secretion. Peak TSH secretion occurs ~15 
min  after  administration  of  exogenous  TRH.  Dopamine,  glucocorti-
coids, and somatostatin suppress TSH but are not of major physiologic 
importance except when these agents are administered in pharmaco-
logic  doses.  Reduced  levels  of  thyroid  hormone  increase  basal  TSH 
production and enhance TRH-mediated stimulation of TSH. High thy-
roid hormone levels rapidly and directly suppress TSH gene expression 
and inhibit TRH stimulation of TSH secretion, indicating that thyroid 
hormones are the dominant regulator of TSH production. Like other 
pituitary hormones, TSH is released in a pulsatile manner and exhib-
its a diurnal rhythm; its highest levels occur at night. However, these 
TSH excursions are modest in comparison to those of other pituitary 
hormones, in part, because TSH has a relatively long plasma half-life  
(50 min). Consequently, single measurements of TSH are adequate for 
assessing  its  circulating  level.  TSH  is  measured  using  immunoradio-
metric assays that are highly sensitive and specific. These assays readily 
distinguish between normal and suppressed TSH values; thus, TSH can 
be  used  for  the  diagnosis  of  primary  hyperthyroidism  (low  TSH)  or 
primary hypothyroidism (high TSH).

THYROID HORMONE SYNTHESIS, 
METABOLISM, AND ACTION
 ■ THYROID HORMONE SYNTHESIS
Thyroid hormones are derived from Tg, a large iodinated glycoprotein. 
After  secretion  into  the  thyroid  follicle,  Tg  is  iodinated  on  tyrosine 
residues that are subsequently coupled via an ether linkage. Reuptake 

of Tg into the thyroid follicular cell allows proteolysis and the release 
of newly synthesized T4 and T3.

Iodine  Metabolism  and  Transport 
Iodide  uptake  is  a  critical 
first  step  in  thyroid  hormone  synthesis.  Ingested  iodine  is  bound  to 
serum  proteins,  particularly  albumin.  Unbound  iodine  is  excreted  in 
the  urine.  The  thyroid  gland  extracts  iodine  from  the  circulation  in 
a highly efficient manner. For example, 10–25% of radioactive tracer 
(e.g.,  123I)  is  taken  up  by  the  normal  thyroid  gland  over  24  h  in  an 
iodine-replete state; this value can rise to 70–90% in Graves’ disease. 
Iodide uptake is mediated by NIS, which is expressed at the basolateral 
membrane of thyroid follicular cells. NIS is most highly expressed in 
the thyroid gland, but low levels are present in the salivary glands, lac-
tating breast, and placenta. The iodide transport mechanism is highly 
regulated,  allowing  adaptation  to  variations  in  dietary  supply.  Low 
iodine levels increase the amount of NIS and stimulate uptake, whereas 
high  iodine  levels  suppress  NIS  expression  and  uptake.  The  selective 
expression  of  NIS  in  the  thyroid  allows  isotopic  scanning,  treatment 
of hyperthyroidism, and ablation of thyroid cancer with radioisotopes 
of iodine, without significant effects on other organs. Mutation of the 
NIS gene is a rare cause of congenital hypothyroidism, underscoring its 
importance in thyroid hormone synthesis. Another iodine transporter, 
pendrin, is located on the apical surface of thyroid cells and mediates 
iodine efflux into the lumen. Mutation of the pendrin gene causes Pen-
dred syndrome, a disorder characterized by defective organification of 
iodine, goiter, and sensorineural deafness.

Iodine deficiency is prevalent in many mountainous regions and in 
central Africa, central South America, and northern Asia (Fig. 382-3). 
Europe  remains  mildly  iodine-deficient,  and  health  surveys  indicate 
that iodine intake has been falling in the United States and Australia. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 2 billion 
people are iodine-deficient, based on urinary excretion data. In areas 
of relative iodine deficiency, there is an increased prevalence of goiter 
and, when deficiency is severe, hypothyroidism and cretinism. Cretin-
ism  is  characterized  by  intellectual  disability  and  growth  retardation 
and occurs when children who live in iodine-deficient regions are not 
treated with iodine or thyroid hormone to restore normal thyroid hor-
mone levels during early life. These children are often born to mothers 
with iodine deficiency, and it is likely that maternal thyroid hormone 
deficiency  worsens  the  condition.  Concomitant  selenium  deficiency 
may  also  contribute  to  the  neurologic  manifestations  of  cretinism. 
Iodine supplementation of salt, bread, and other food substances has 
markedly reduced the prevalence of cretinism. Unfortunately, however, 
iodine deficiency remains the most common cause of preventable intel-
lectual disability, often because of societal resistance to food additives 
or  the  cost  of  supplementation.  In  addition  to  overt  cretinism,  mild 
iodine  deficiency  can  lead  to  subtle  reduction  of  IQ.  Oversupply  of 
iodine,  through  supplements  or  foods  enriched  in  iodine  (e.g.,  shell-
fish,  kelp),  is  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  autoimmune 
thyroid  disease.  The  Recommended  Dietary  Allowance  (RDA)  is  
220 μg iodine per day for pregnant women and 290 μg iodine per day 
for breastfeeding women. Because the effects of iodine deficiency are 
most severe in pregnant women and their babies, the American Thy-
roid Association has recommended that all pregnant and breastfeeding 
women in the United States and Canada take a prenatal multivitamin 
containing  150  μg  iodine  per  day.  Urinary  iodine  is  >100  μg/L  in 
iodine-sufficient populations.

Organification, Coupling, Storage, and Release  After iodide 
enters  the  thyroid,  it  is  trapped  and  transported  to  the  apical  mem-
brane of thyroid follicular cells, where it is oxidized in an organifica-
tion reaction that involves TPO and hydrogen peroxide produced by 
dual  oxidase  (DUOX)  and  DUOX  maturation  factor  (DUOXA).  The 
reactive iodine atom is added to specific tyrosyl residues within Tg, a 
large (660 kDa) dimeric protein that consists of 2769 amino acids. The 
iodotyrosines in Tg are then coupled via an ether linkage in a reaction 
that is also catalyzed by TPO. Either T4 or T3 can be produced by this 
reaction,  depending  on  the  number  of  iodine  atoms  present  in  the 
iodotyrosines.  After  coupling,  Tg  is  taken  back  into  the  thyroid  cell,

FIGURE 382-3  Worldwide iodine nutrition.  aIn population monitoring of iodine status using urinary iodine concentration (UIC), school-age children (SAC) serve as a proxy 
for the general population; therefore, preference has been given to studies carried out in SAC. The UIC data have been selected for each country in the following order of 
priority: data from the most recent known nationally representative survey carried out between 2005 and 2020 in (i) SAC, (ii) SAC and adolescents, (iii) adolescents, (iv) women 
of reproductive age, (v) other adults (excluding pregnant or lactating women), and (vi) other eligible populations. In the absence of recent national surveys, subnational data 
were used in the same order of priority. Subnational UIC surveys are commonly carried out to provide a rapid assessment of population iodine status, but due to a lack of 
sampling rigor, they may over- or underestimate the iodine status at the national level and should be interpreted with caution. bAdequate iodine intake in school-age children 
corresponds to median UIC values in the range 100-299 μg/L, and includes categories previously referred to as “Adequate” (100-199 μg/L) and “More than adequate” 
(200-299 μg/L). (Reproduced with permission from The Iodine Global Network. Global scorecard of iodine nutrition in 2021 in the general population based on data in school-age

where  it  is  processed  in  lysosomes  to  release  T4  and  T3.  Uncoupled 
mono-  and  diiodotyrosines  (MIT,  DIT)  can  be  deiodinated  by  the 
enzyme  dehalogenase,  thereby  recycling  any  iodide  that  is  not  con-
verted into thyroid hormones.

Disorders of thyroid hormone synthesis are rare causes of congenital 
hypothyroidism (Chap. 383). The vast majority of these disorders are 
due to recessive mutations in TPO or Tg, but defects have also been 
identified in the TSH-R, NIS, pendrin, hydrogen peroxide generation, 
and  dehalogenase,  as  well  as  genes  involved  in  thyroid  gland  devel-
opment. In the case of biosynthetic defects, the gland is incapable of 
synthesizing adequate amounts of hormone, leading to increased TSH 
and a large goiter.

TSH  Action  TSH  regulates  thyroid  gland  function  through  the 
TSH-R, a seven-transmembrane G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR). 
The TSH-R is coupled to the α subunit of stimulatory G protein (GSα), 
which  activates  adenylyl  cyclase,  leading  to  increased  production  of 
cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (cAMP).  TSH  also  stimulates  phos-
phatidylinositol  turnover  by  activating  phospholipase  C.  Recessive 
loss-of-function  TSH-R  mutations  cause  thyroid  hypoplasia  and  con-
genital  hypothyroidism.  Dominant  gain-of-function  mutations  cause 
sporadic  or  familial  hyperthyroidism  that  is  characterized  by  goiter, 
thyroid cell hyperplasia, and autonomous function (Chap. 384). Most 
of these activating mutations occur in the transmembrane domain of 

the receptor. They mimic the conformational changes induced by TSH 
binding  or  the  interactions  of  thyroid-stimulating  immunoglobulins 
(TSIs)  in  Graves’  disease.  Activating  TSH-R  mutations  also  occur  as 
somatic events, leading to clonal selection and expansion of the affected 
thyroid follicular cell and autonomously functioning thyroid nodules.

Other  Factors  That  Influence  Hormone  Synthesis  and 
Release  Although  TSH  is  the  dominant  hormonal  regulator  of 
thyroid gland growth and function, a variety of growth factors, most 
produced locally in the thyroid gland, also influence thyroid hormone 
synthesis. These include insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), epider-
mal growth factor, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), endothelins, 
and various cytokines. The quantitative roles of these factors are not 
well  understood,  but  they  are  important  in  selected  disease  states. 
In  acromegaly,  for  example,  increased  levels  of  growth  hormone  and 
IGF-1  are  associated  with  goiter  and  predisposition  to  multinodular 
goiter  (MNG).  Certain  cytokines  and  interleukins  (ILs)  produced  in 
association with autoimmune thyroid disease induce thyroid growth, 
whereas  others  lead  to  apoptosis.  Iodine  deficiency  increases  thyroid 
blood flow and upregulates the NIS, stimulating more efficient iodine

a phenomenon known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. In individuals with 
a  normal  thyroid,  the  gland  escapes  from  this  inhibitory  effect  and 
iodide  organification  resumes;  the  suppressive  action  of  high  iodide

THYROID FUNCTION IN PREGNANCY
Five  factors  alter  thyroid  function  in  pregnancy:  (1)  the  transient 
increase in hCG during the first trimester, which weakly stimulates the 
TSH-R; (2) the estrogen-induced rise in TBG during the first trimester, 
which  is  sustained  during  pregnancy;  (3)  alterations  in  the  immune 
system, leading to the onset, exacerbation, or amelioration of an under-
lying  autoimmune  thyroid  disease;  (4)  increased  thyroid  hormone 
metabolism  by  the  placental  type  III  deiodinase;  and  (5)  increased 
urinary iodide excretion, which can cause impaired thyroid hormone 
production  in  areas  of  marginal  iodine  sufficiency.  Women  with  a 
precarious  iodine  intake  (<50  μg/d)  are  most  at  risk  of  developing  a 
goiter during pregnancy or giving birth to an infant with a goiter and 
hypothyroidism. The World Health Organization recommends a daily 
iodine intake of 250 μg during pregnancy and lactation, and prenatal 
vitamins should contain 150 μg per tablet.

The  rise  in  circulating  hCG  levels  during  the  first  trimester  is 
accompanied by a reciprocal fall in TSH that persists into the middle 
of pregnancy. This reflects the weak binding of hCG, which is present 
at very high levels, to the TSH-R. Rare individuals have variant TSH-R 
sequences  that  enhance  hCG  binding  and  TSH-R  activation.  hCG- 
induced changes in thyroid function can result in transient gestational 
hyperthyroidism that may be associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, 
a  condition  characterized  by  severe  nausea  and  vomiting  and  risk  of 
volume  depletion.  However,  since  the  hyperthyroidism  is  not  causal, 
antithyroid drugs are not indicated unless concomitant Graves’ disease 
is  suspected.  Parenteral  fluid  replacement  usually  suffices  until  the 
condition resolves.

Normative  values  for  most  thyroid  function  tests  differ  during 
pregnancy and, if available, trimester-specific reference ranges should 
be used when diagnosing thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy. TSH 
levels decrease at the end of the first trimester and then rise as gesta-
tion progresses so that the nonpregnant reference ranges can be used 
from mid-gestation to delivery. Total T4 and T3 levels are ~1.5× higher 
throughout  pregnancy,  but  the  free  T4,  which  is  the  same  or  slightly 
higher at the end of the 1st trimester, then progressively decreases so 
that third-trimester values in healthy pregnancies are often below the 
nonpregnant lower reference cutoff.

During  pregnancy,  subclinical  hypothyroidism  occurs  in  2%  of 
women, but overt hypothyroidism is present in only 1 in 500. Prospec-
tive randomized controlled trials have not shown a benefit for univer-
sal  thyroid  disease  screening  in  pregnancy.  Targeted  TSH  testing  for 
hypothyroidism is recommended for women planning a pregnancy if 
they have a strong family history of autoimmune thyroid disease, other 
autoimmune disorders (e.g., type 1 diabetes), infertility, prior preterm 
delivery  or  recurrent  miscarriage,  or  signs  or  symptoms  of  thyroid 
disease,  or  are  older  than  30  years.  Thyroid  hormone  requirements 
are increased by up to 45% during pregnancy in levothyroxine-treated 
hypothyroid women.

 ■ THYROID HORMONE TRANSPORT  
AND METABOLISM
Serum-Binding  Proteins  T4  is  secreted  from  the  thyroid  gland 
in  about  twentyfold  excess  over  T3  (Table  382-1).  Both  hormones 
are  bound  to  plasma  proteins,  including  thyroxine-binding  globulin 
(TBG), transthyretin (TTR, formerly known as thyroxine-binding pre-
albumin [TBPA]), and albumin. The plasma-binding proteins increase 
the  pool  of  circulating  hormone,  delay  hormone  clearance,  and  may 
modulate hormone delivery to selected tissue sites. The concentration 
of TBG is relatively low (1–2 mg/dL), but because of its high affinity for 
thyroid hormones (T4 > T3), it carries ~80% of the bound hormones. 
Albumin has relatively low affinity for thyroid hormones but has a high 
plasma  concentration  (~3.5  g/dL),  and  it  binds  up  to  10%  of  T4  and 
30% of T3. TTR carries ~10% of T4 but little T3.

When  the  effects  of  the  various  binding  proteins  are  combined, 
~99.98% of T4 and 99.7% of T3 are protein-bound. Because T3 is less

tightly  bound  than  T4,  the  fraction  of  unbound  T3  is  greater  than 
unbound T4, but there is less unbound T3 in the circulation because it 
is produced in smaller amounts and cleared more rapidly than T4. The 
unbound or “free” concentrations of the hormones are ~2 × 10–11 M for 
T4 and ~6 × 10–12 M for T3, which roughly correspond to the thyroid 
hormone receptor–binding constants for these hormones (see below). 
The unbound hormone is thought to be biologically available to tissues. 
The homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the thyroid axis are directed 
toward maintenance of normal concentrations of unbound hormones.

Abnormalities  of  Thyroid  Hormone–Binding  Proteins  
A  number  of  inherited  and  acquired  abnormalities  affect  thyroid  
hormone–binding  proteins.  X-linked  TBG  deficiency  is  associated 
with  very  low  levels  of  total  T4  and  T3.  However,  because  unbound 
hormone levels are normal, patients are euthyroid and TSH levels are 
normal.  It  is  important  to  recognize  this  disorder  to  avoid  efforts  to 
normalize  total  T4  levels,  because  this  leads  to  thyrotoxicosis  and  is 
futile because of rapid hormone clearance in the absence of TBG. TBG 
levels  are  elevated  by  estrogen,  which  increases  sialylation  and  delays 
TBG  clearance.  Consequently,  in  women  who  are  pregnant  or  taking 
estrogen-containing  contraceptives,  elevated  TBG  increases  total  T4 
and T3 levels; however, unbound T4 and T3 levels are normal. These fea-
tures are part of the explanation for why women with hypothyroidism 
require  increased  amounts  of  l-thyroxine  replacement  as  TBG  levels 
are increased by pregnancy or estrogen treatment. Mutations in TBG, 
TTR, and albumin may increase the binding affinity for T4 and/or T3 
and cause disorders known as euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia or familial 
dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (FDH) (Table 382-2). These disor-
ders result in increased total T4 and/or T3, but unbound hormone levels 
are normal. The familial nature of the disorders, and the fact that TSH 
levels are normal rather than suppressed, should suggest this diagnosis. 
Unbound  hormone  levels  (ideally  measured  by  dialysis)  are  normal 
in FDH. The diagnosis can be confirmed by using tests that measure 
the  affinities  of  radiolabeled  hormone  binding  to  specific  transport 
proteins  or  by  performing  DNA  sequence  analyses  of  the  abnormal 
transport protein genes.

Certain medications, such as salicylates and salsalate, can displace 
thyroid  hormones  from  circulating  binding  proteins.  Although  these 
drugs  transiently  perturb  the  thyroid  axis  by  increasing  free  thyroid 
hormone levels, TSH is suppressed until a new steady state is reached, 
thereby  restoring  euthyroidism.  Circulating  factors  associated  with 
acute illness may also displace thyroid hormone from binding proteins 
(Chap. 384).

Deiodinases  T4  may  be  thought  of  as  a  precursor  for  the  more 
potent T3. T4 is converted to T3 by the deiodinase enzymes (Fig. 382-1). 
Type I deiodinase, which is located primarily in thyroid, liver, and kid-
neys, has a relatively low affinity for T4. Type II deiodinase has a higher 
affinity  for  T4  and  is  found  primarily  in  the  pituitary  gland,  brain, 
brown fat, and thyroid gland. Expression of type II deiodinase allows it 
to regulate T3 concentrations locally, a property that may be important 
in  the  context  of  levothyroxine  (T4)  replacement.  Type  II  deiodinase

is  also  regulated  by  thyroid  hormone;  hypothyroidism  induces  the 
enzyme,  resulting  in  enhanced  T4  →  T3  conversion  in  tissues  such 
as  brain  and  pituitary.  T4  →  T3  conversion  is  impaired  by  fasting, 
systemic illness or acute trauma, oral contrast agents, and a variety of 
medications  (e.g.,  propylthiouracil,  propranolol,  amiodarone,  gluco-
corticoids). Type III deiodinase inactivates T4 and T3 and is the most 
important  source  of  reverse  T3  (rT3),  including  in  the  sick  euthyroid 
syndrome. This enzyme is expressed in the human placenta but is not 
active in healthy individuals. In the sick euthyroid syndrome, especially 
with hypoperfusion, the type III deiodinase is activated in muscle and 
liver.  Massive  hemangiomas  and  other  tumors  that  express  type  III 
deiodinase are a rare cause of consumptive hypothyroidism.
 ■ THYROID HORMONE ACTION
Thyroid  Hormone  Transport  Circulating  thyroid  hormones 
enter  cells  by  passive  diffusion  and  via  specific  transporters  such  as 
the  monocarboxylate  8  transporter  (MCT8),  MCT10,  and  organic 
anion-transporting  polypeptide  1C1.  Mutations  in  the  MCT8  gene 
have been identified in patients with X-linked psychomotor retardation 
and thyroid function abnormalities (low T4, high T3, and high TSH). 
After entering cells, thyroid hormones act primarily through nuclear 
receptors, although they also have nongenomic actions through stim-
ulating  mitochondrial  enzymatic  responses  and  may  act  directly  on 
blood vessels and the heart through integrin receptors.
Nuclear Thyroid Hormone Receptors  Thyroid hormones bind 
with  high  affinity  to  nuclear  TRs  α  and  β.  Both  TRα  and  TRβ  are 
expressed  in  most  tissues,  but  their  relative  expression  levels  vary 
among organs; TRα is particularly abundant in brain, kidneys, gonads, 
muscle,  and  heart,  whereas  TRβ  expression  is  relatively  high  in  the 
pituitary and liver. Both receptors are variably spliced to form unique 
isoforms. The TRβ2 isoform, which has a unique amino terminus, is 
selectively expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary, where it plays 
a  role  in  feedback  control  of  the  thyroid  axis  (see  above).  The  TRα2 
isoform  contains  a  unique  carboxy  terminus  that  precludes  thyroid 
hormone  binding;  it  may  function  to  inhibit  the  action  of  other  TR 
isoforms.

The TRs contain a central DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal 
ligand-binding domain. They bind to specific DNA sequences, termed 
thyroid  response  elements  (TREs),  in  target  genes  (Fig.  382-4).  The 
receptors  bind  as  homodimers  or,  more  commonly,  as  heterodimers

Some patients clinically thyrotoxic

with  retinoic  acid  X  receptors  (RXRs) 
(Chap.  377).  The  activated  receptor 
can either stimulate gene transcription 
(e.g., myosin heavy chain α) or inhibit 
transcription  (e.g.,  TSH  β-subunit 
gene), depending on the nature of the 
regulatory elements in the target gene.
Thyroid  hormones  (T3  and  T4) 
bind  with  similar  affinities  to  TRα 
and  TRβ.  However,  structural  differ-
ences  in  the  ligand-binding  domains 
provide  the  potential  for  developing 
receptor-selective  agonists  or  antag-
onists,  and  these  are  under  investi-
gation.  T3  is  bound  with  10–15  times 
greater affinity than T4, which explains 
its  increased  potency.  Although  T4  is 
produced in excess of T3, receptors are 
occupied  mainly  by  T3,  reflecting  T4 
→  T3  conversion  by  peripheral  tissues, 
T3  bioavailability  in  the  plasma,  and 
the greater affinity of receptors for T3. 
After binding to TRs, thyroid hormone 
induces conformational changes in the 
receptors  that  modify  its  interactions 
with  accessory  transcription  factors. 
Importantly, in the absence of thyroid 
hormone  binding,  the  aporeceptors 
bind to co-repressor proteins that inhibit gene transcription. Hormone 
binding  dissociates  the  co-repressors  and  allows  the  recruitment  of 
co-activators that enhance transcription. The discovery of TR interac-
tions with co-repressors explains the fact that TR silences gene expres-
sion  in  the  absence  of  hormone  binding.  Consequently,  hormone 
deficiency has a profound effect on gene expression because it causes 
gene repression as well as loss of hormone-induced stimulation. This 
concept  has  been  corroborated  by  the  finding  that  targeted  deletion 
of the TR genes in mice has a less pronounced phenotypic effect than 
hormone deficiency.

Thyroid  Hormone  Resistance  Resistance  to  thyroid  hormone 
(RTH)  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder  characterized  by  elevated 
thyroid hormone levels and inappropriately normal or elevated TSH.

FIGURE  382-4  Mechanism  of  thyroid  hormone  receptor  action.  The  thyroid 
hormone receptor (TR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) form heterodimers that bind 
specifically to thyroid hormone response elements (TRE) in the promoter regions 
of target genes. In the absence of hormone, TR binds co-repressor (CoR) proteins 
that silence gene expression. The numbers refer to a series of ordered reactions 
that  occur  in  response  to  thyroid  hormone:  (1)  T4  or  T3  enters  the  nucleus;  (2)  T3 
binding  dissociates  CoR  from  TR;  (3)  co-activators  (CoA)  are  recruited  to  the  T3-
bound receptor; and (4) gene expression is altered.

Individuals with RTH do not, in general, exhibit signs and symptoms 
that are typical of hypothyroidism because hormone resistance is par-
tial and is compensated by increased levels of thyroid hormone. The 
clinical features of RTH can include goiter, attention deficit disorder, 
mild  reduction  in  IQ,  delayed  skeletal  maturation,  tachycardia,  and 
impaired metabolic responses to thyroid hormone.

Classical forms of RTH are caused by mutations in the TRβ gene. 
These  mutations,  located  in  restricted  regions  of  the  ligand-binding 
domain, cause loss of receptor function. However, because the mutant 
receptors  retain  the  capacity  to  dimerize  with  RXRs,  bind  to  DNA, 
and recruit co-repressor proteins, they function as antagonists of the 
remaining normal TRβ and TRα receptors. This property, referred to as 
“dominant negative” activity, explains the autosomal dominant mode 
of  transmission.  The  diagnosis  is  suspected  when  unbound  thyroid 
hormone  levels  are  increased  without  suppression  of  TSH.  Similar 
hormonal abnormalities are found in other affected family members, 
although the TRβ mutation arises de novo in ~20% of patients. DNA 
sequence analysis of the TRβ gene provides a definitive diagnosis. RTH 
must be distinguished from other causes of euthyroid hyperthyroxine-
mia (e.g., FDH) and inappropriate secretion of TSH by TSH-secreting 
pituitary  adenomas  (Chap.  380).  In  most  patients,  no  treatment  is 
indicated; the importance of making the diagnosis is to avoid inappro-
priate treatment of mistaken hyperthyroidism and to provide genetic 
counseling.

A  distinct  form  of  RTH  is  caused  by  mutations  in  the  TRα  gene. 
Affected  patients  have  many  clinical  features  of  congenital  hypothy-
roidism  including  growth  retardation,  skeletal  dysplasia,  and  severe 
constipation. In contrast to RTH caused by mutations in TRβ, thyroid 
function  tests  include  normal  TSH,  low  or  normal  T4,  and  normal 
or  elevated  T3  levels.  These  distinct  clinical  and  laboratory  features 
underscore the different tissue distribution and functional roles of TRβ 
and TRα. Thyroxine treatment appears to alleviate some of the clinical 
manifestations of patients with RTH caused by TRα mutations.
 ■ PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
In addition to the examination of the thyroid itself, the physical exami-
nation should include a search for signs of abnormal thyroid function 
and  the  extrathyroidal  features  of  ophthalmopathy  and  dermopathy 
(Chap. 384). Examination of the neck begins by inspecting the seated 
patient from the front and side and noting any surgical scars, obvious 
masses,  or  distended  veins.  The  thyroid  can  be  palpated  with  both 
hands  from  behind  or  while  facing  the  patient,  using  the  thumbs  to 
palpate  each  lobe.  It  is  best  to  use  a  combination  of  these  methods, 
especially when nodules are small. The patient’s neck should be slightly 
flexed  to  relax  the  neck  muscles.  After  locating  the  cricoid  cartilage, 
the  isthmus,  which  is  attached  to  the  lower  one-third  of  the  thyroid 
lobes,  can  be  identified  and  then  followed  laterally  to  locate  either 
lobe (normally, the right lobe is slightly larger than the left). By asking 
the patient to swallow sips of water, thyroid consistency can be better 
appreciated as the gland moves beneath the examiner’s fingers.

Features  to  be  noted  include  thyroid  size,  consistency,  nodularity, 
and any tenderness or fixation. An estimate of thyroid size (normally 
12–20 g) should be made, and a drawing is often the best way to record 
findings. Ultrasound imaging provides the most accurate measurement 
of thyroid volume and nodularity and is useful for assessment of goiter 
prevalence  in  iodine-deficient  regions.  However,  ultrasound  is  not 
indicated if the thyroid physical examination is normal. The size, loca-
tion, and consistency of any nodules should also be defined. A bruit 
or thrill over the gland, located over the insertion of the superior and 
inferior thyroid arteries (supero- or inferolaterally), indicates increased 
vascularity, associated with turbulent rather than laminar blood flow, 
as occurs in hyperthyroidism. If the lower borders of the thyroid lobes 
are  not  clearly  felt,  a  goiter  may  be  retrosternal.  Large  retrosternal 
goiters can cause venous distention over the neck and difficulty breath-
ing, especially when the arms are raised (Pemberton’s sign). With any 
central  mass  above  the  thyroid,  the  tongue  should  be  extended,  as 
thyroglossal cysts then move upward. The thyroid examination is not 
complete without assessment for lymphadenopathy in the supraclavic-
ular and cervical regions of the neck.

 ■ LABORATORY EVALUATION
Measurement of Thyroid Hormones  The enhanced sensitivity 
and specificity of TSH assays have greatly improved laboratory assess-
ment  of  thyroid  function.  Because  TSH  levels  change  dynamically  in 
response to alterations of T4 and T3, a logical approach to thyroid testing 
is  to  first  determine  whether  TSH  is  suppressed,  normal,  or  elevated. 
With rare exceptions (see below), a normal TSH level excludes a primary 
abnormality  of  thyroid  function.  This  strategy  depends  on  the  use  of 
immunochemiluminometric assays (ICMAs) for TSH that are sensitive 
enough to discriminate between the lower limit of the reference interval 
and  the  suppressed  values  that  occur  with  thyrotoxicosis.  Extremely 
sensitive assays can detect TSH levels ≤0.004 mIU/L, but, for practical 
purposes, assays sensitive to ≤0.1 mIU/L are sufficient. The widespread 
availability  of  the  TSH  ICMA  has  rendered  the  TRH  stimulation  test 
obsolete, because the failure of TSH to rise after an intravenous bolus 
of  200–400  μg  TRH  has  the  same  implications  as  a  suppressed  basal 
TSH measured by ICMA. Because the antibodies used in the ICMA are 
biotinylated, biotin supplements, including biotin in multivitamins, can 
interfere  with  TSH  measurement,  resulting  in  falsely  low  TSH  values 
and falsely high T4 or T3 levels. Therefore, patients should be advised 
to stop taking biotin for at least 2 days prior to thyroid function testing.
The finding of an abnormal TSH level must be followed by measure-
ments of circulating thyroid hormone levels to confirm the diagnosis of 
hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH) or hypothyroidism (elevated TSH). 
Automated  immunoassays  are  widely  available  for  serum  total  T4  and 
total  T3.  T4  and  T3  are  highly  protein-bound,  and  numerous  factors 
(illness, medications, genetic factors) can influence protein binding. It 
is  useful,  therefore,  to  measure  the  free,  or  unbound,  hormone  levels, 
which correspond to the biologically available hormone pool. Two direct 
methods are used to measure unbound thyroid hormones: (1) unbound 
thyroid  hormone  competition  with  radiolabeled  T4  (or  an  analogue) 
for  binding  to  a  solid-phase  antibody,  and  (2)  physical  separation  of 
the  unbound  hormone  fraction  by  ultracentrifugation  or  equilibrium 
dialysis.  Although  early  unbound  hormone  immunoassays  suffered 
from artifacts, newer assays correlate well with the results of the more 
technically demanding and expensive physical separation methods. An 
indirect method that is now less commonly used to estimate unbound 
thyroid hormone levels is to calculate the free T3 or free T4 index from 
the total T4 or T3 concentration and the thyroid hormone binding ratio 
(THBR). The latter is derived from the T3-resin uptake test, which deter-
mines  the  distribution  of  radiolabeled  T3  between  an  absorbent  resin 
and the unoccupied thyroid hormone–binding proteins in the sample. 
The  binding  of  the  labeled  T3  to  the  resin  is  increased  when  there  is 
reduced  unoccupied  protein  binding  sites  (e.g.,  TBG  deficiency)  or 
increased total thyroid hormone in the sample; it is decreased under the 
opposite circumstances. The product of THBR and total T3 or T4 pro-
vides the free T3 or T4 index. In effect, the index corrects for anomalous 
total hormone values caused by variations in hormone-protein binding.
Total  thyroid  hormone  levels  are  elevated  when  TBG  is  increased 
due  to  estrogens  (pregnancy,  oral  contraceptives,  hormone  therapy, 
tamoxifen, selective estrogen receptor modulators, inflammatory liver 
disease)  and  decreased  when  TBG  binding  is  reduced  (androgens, 
nephrotic  syndrome).  Genetic  disorders  and  acute  illness  can  also 
cause abnormalities in thyroid hormone–binding proteins, and various 
drugs  (phenytoin,  carbamazepine,  salicylates,  and  nonsteroidal  anti- 
inflammatory  drugs  [NSAIDs])  can  interfere  with  thyroid  hormone 
binding. Because unbound thyroid hormone levels are normal and the 
patient is euthyroid in all of these circumstances, assays that measure 
unbound hormone are preferable to those for total thyroid hormones.
For  most  purposes,  the  unbound  T4  level  is  sufficient  to  confirm 
thyrotoxicosis,  but  2–5%  of  patients  have  only  an  elevated  T3  level  
(T3 toxicosis). Thus, unbound T3 levels should be measured in patients 
with a suppressed TSH but normal unbound T4 levels.

There are several clinical conditions in which the use of TSH as a 
screening  test  may  be  misleading,  particularly  without  simultaneous 
unbound T4 determinations. Any severe nonthyroidal illness can cause 
abnormal TSH levels. Although hypothyroidism is the most common 
cause  of  an  elevated  TSH  level,  rare  causes  include  a  TSH-secreting

2932 pituitary  tumor  (Chap.  380),  thyroid  hormone  resistance,  and  assay 
artifact. Conversely, a suppressed TSH level, particularly <0.01 mIU/L, 
usually  indicates  thyrotoxicosis.  However,  subnormal  TSH  levels 
between 0.01 and 0.1 mIU/L may be seen during the first trimester of 
pregnancy (due to hCG secretion), after treatment of hyperthyroidism 
(because  TSH  can  remain  suppressed  for  several  months),  and  in 
response  to  certain  medications  (e.g.,  high  doses  of  glucocorticoids 
or  dopamine).  TSH  levels  measured  by  immunoassay  may  also  be 
suppressed  in  patients  ingesting  biotin  supplements  <18  h  prior  to  a 
blood draw because the TSH capture antibodies are biotinylated and 
the  exogenous  biotin  can  interfere  with  the  subsequent  streptavidin 
capture.  Importantly,  secondary  hypothyroidism,  caused  by  hypo-
thalamic-pituitary disease, is associated with a variable (low to high- 
normal) TSH level, which is inappropriate for the low T4 level. Thus, TSH 
should not be used as an isolated laboratory test to assess thyroid function 
in patients with suspected or known hypothalamic or pituitary disease.

Tests for the end-organ effects of thyroid hormone excess or deple-
tion,  such  as  estimation  of  basal  metabolic  rate,  tendon  reflex  relax-
ation rates, or serum cholesterol, are relatively insensitive and are not 
useful as clinical determinants of thyroid function.
Tests  to  Determine  the  Etiology  of  Thyroid  Dysfunction  
Autoimmune  thyroid  disease  is  detected  most  easily  by  measuring 
circulating antibodies against TPO and Tg. Because antibodies to Tg 
alone  are  less  common,  it  is  reasonable  to  measure  only  TPO  anti-
bodies. About 5–15% of euthyroid women and up to 2% of euthyroid 
men have thyroid antibodies; such individuals are at increased risk of 
developing thyroid dysfunction. Almost all patients with autoimmune 
hypothyroidism,  and  up  to  80%  of  those  with  Graves’  disease,  have 
TPO antibodies, usually at high levels.

TSIs  are  antibodies  that  stimulate  the  TSH-R  in  Graves’  disease. 
They are most commonly measured by commercially available tracer 
displacement  assays  called  TRAb  (TSH  receptor  antibody)  with  the 
assumption that elevated levels in the setting of clinical hyperthyroid-
ism reflect stimulatory effects on the TSH receptor. A bioassay is less 
commonly used. Remission rates in patients with Graves’ disease after 
antithyroid drug cessation are higher with disappearance rather than 
persistence of TRAb. Furthermore, the TRAb assay is used to predict 
both fetal and neonatal thyrotoxicosis caused by transplacental passage 
of high maternal levels of TRAb or TSI (>3× upper limit of normal) in 
the last trimester of pregnancy.

Serum  Tg  levels  are  increased  in  all  types  of  thyrotoxicosis  except 
thyrotoxicosis  factitia  caused  by  self-administration  of  thyroid  hor-
mone.  Tg  levels  are  particularly  increased  in  thyroiditis,  reflecting 
thyroid  tissue  destruction  and  release  of  Tg.  The  main  role  for  Tg 
measurement, however, is in the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients. 
After  total  thyroidectomy  and  radioablation,  Tg  levels  should  be  
<0.2  ng/mL  in  the  absence  of  anti-Tg  antibodies;  measurable  levels 
indicate incomplete ablation or recurrent cancer.

Radioiodine Uptake and Thyroid Scanning  The thyroid gland 
selectively  transports  radioisotopes  of  iodine  (123I,  125I,  131I)  and  99mTc 
pertechnetate, allowing thyroid imaging and quantitation of radioac-
tive tracer fractional uptake.

Nuclear imaging of Graves’ disease is characterized by an enlarged 
gland and increased tracer uptake that is distributed homogeneously. 
Toxic  adenomas  appear  as  focal  areas  of  increased  uptake,  with 
suppressed  tracer  uptake  in  the  remainder  of  the  gland  (reflecting 
suppressed TSH). In toxic MNG, the gland is enlarged—often with dis-
torted architecture—and there are multiple areas of relatively increased 
(functioning nodules) or decreased tracer uptake (suppressed thyroid 
parenchyma or nonfunctioning nodules). Subacute, viral, and postpar-
tum thyroiditis are associated with very low uptake because of follicular 
cell damage and TSH suppression. Thyrotoxicosis factitia is also associ-
ated with low uptake because exogenous hormone suppresses TSH. In 
addition, if there is excessive circulating exogenous iodine (e.g., from 
dietary sources of iodinated contrast dye), the radionuclide uptake is 
low even in the presence of increased thyroid hormone production.

Thyroid scintigraphy is not used in the routine evaluation of patients 
with thyroid nodules but should be performed if the serum TSH level 

is  subnormal  to  determine  if  functioning  thyroid  nodules  are  pres-
ent.  Functioning  or  “hot”  nodules  are  almost  never  malignant,  and 
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is not indicated. The vast majority 
of thyroid nodules do not produce thyroid hormone (“cold” nodules), 
and these are more likely to be malignant (~5–10%). Whole-body and 
thyroid scanning is also used in the treatment and, now less frequently, 
in the surveillance of thyroid cancer. After thyroidectomy for thyroid 
cancer, the TSH level is raised by either using a thyroid hormone with-
drawal  protocol  or  recombinant  human  TSH  injection  (Chap.  385). 
Administration  of  either  131I  or  123I  (in  higher  activities  than  used  to 
image  the  thyroid  gland  alone)  allows  whole-body  scanning  (WBS) 
to  detect  the  thyroid  remnant.  WBS  imaging  is  also  performed  after 
therapeutic  administration  of  131I,  which  confirms  remnant  ablation 
and may reveal iodine-avid metastases.
Thyroid  Ultrasound  Ultrasonography  is  the  most  valuable  tool 
for  the  diagnosis  and  evaluation  of  patients  with  nodular  thyroid 
disease  (Chap.  385).  Evidence-based  guidelines  recommend  thyroid 
ultrasonography  for  all  patients  suspected  of  having  thyroid  nodules 
by either physical examination or another imaging study. Using 10- to 
12-MHz linear transducers, resolution and image quality are excellent, 
allowing the characterization of nodules and cysts >3 mm. Sonographic 
patterns that combine suspicious sonographic features are highly sug-
gestive of malignancy (e.g., hypoechoic solid nodules with infiltrative 
borders  and  microcalcifications,  >90%  cancer  risk),  whereas  other 
patterns  correlate  with  a  lower  likelihood  of  cancer  (isoechoic  solid 
nodules,  5–10%  cancer  risk).  Some  patterns  suggest  benignity  (e.g., 
spongiform nodules, defined as those with multiple small internal cys-
tic areas, or simple cysts, <3% cancer risk) (see Chap. 385, Fig. 385-2). 
These patterns have been incorporated into validated risk stratification 
systems (RSSs) for sonographic imaging of thyroid nodules (American 
College  of  Radiology  [ACR]  Thyroid  Imaging  Reporting  and  Data 
System [TI-RADS], American Thyroid Association, European Thyroid 
Association  [EU-TIRADS]  and  others)  (see  Chap.  385,  Fig.  385-1). 
These systems are relatively concordant in the classification of thyroid 
nodules; they differ in size cutoff recommendations for FNA. Not sur-
prisingly, the RSSs with lower size cutoffs have higher sensitivity and 
lower  specificity  for  thyroid  cancer  diagnosis  than  those  with  higher 
cutoffs. Nevertheless, all have been shown to reduce unnecessary FNAs 
by  at  least  45%,  in  part  due  to  the  recommendation  not  to  perform 
FNA of spongiform nodules.

In addition to evaluating thyroid nodules, ultrasound is useful for 
monitoring  nodule  size  and  for  the  aspiration  of  nodules  or  cystic 
lesions.  Ultrasound-guided  FNA  biopsy  of  thyroid  lesions  lowers  the 
rate of inadequate sampling and decreases sample error, thereby reduc-
ing both the nondiagnostic and false-negative rates of FNA cytology. 
Ultrasonography of the central and lateral cervical lymph node com-
partments is indispensable in the evaluation of thyroid cancer patients, 
preoperatively  and  during  follow-up.  In  addition,  the  ACR  recom-
mends a survey of the cervical lymph nodes as part of every diagnostic 
thyroid sonographic examination.

383 Hypothyroidism

J. Larry Jameson, Susan J. Mandel,  
Anthony P. Weetman

HYPOTHYROIDISM
Iodine deficiency remains a common cause of hypothyroidism world-
wide. In areas of iodine sufficiency, autoimmune disease (Hashimoto’s 
thyroiditis) and iatrogenic causes (treatment of hyperthyroidism) are 
most common (Table 383-1).

 ■ CONGENITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM
Prevalence  Hypothyroidism occurs in about 1 in 2000–4000 new-
borns,  and  neonatal  screening  is  performed  in  most  industrialized 
countries.  It  may  be  transient,  especially  if  the  mother  has  thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSH-R)–blocking antibodies or 
has received antithyroid drugs, but permanent hypothyroidism occurs 
in the majority. The causes of neonatal hypothyroidism include thyroid 
gland dysgenesis in 65%, inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis in 
30%, and TSH-R antibody mediated in 5% of affected newborns. The 
developmental abnormalities are twice as common in girls. Mutations 
that  cause  congenital  hypothyroidism  are  being  increasingly  identi-
fied, but most remain idiopathic. These can be broadly categorized as 
mutations  causing  (1)  central  hypothyroidism  because  of  abnormal 
hypothalamic-pituitary  development  or  the  loss  of  specific  compo-
nents  of  the  thyrotropin-releasing  hormone  (TRH)/TSH  hormonal 
pathways;  (2)  abnormal  thyroid  gland  development  or  dysgenesis; 
or  (3)  abnormal  thyroid  hormone  synthesis  and  processing,  or  dys-
hormonogenesis  (Table  383-2).  Transplacental  passage  of  maternal 
thyroid hormone occurs before the fetal thyroid gland begins to func-
tion and provides partial hormone support to a fetus with congenital  
hypothyroidism.

Clinical  Manifestations  The  majority  of  infants  appear  normal 
at  birth,  and  with  the  use  of  biochemical  screening,  few  cases  are 
now  diagnosed  based  on  clinical  features,  which  include  prolonged 
jaundice, feeding problems, hypotonia, enlarged tongue, delayed bone 
maturation,  and  umbilical  hernia.  Importantly,  permanent  neuro-
logic damage results if treatment is delayed. Typical features of adult 
hypothyroidism may also be present (Table 383-3). Other congenital 
malformations,  especially  cardiac,  are  four  times  more  common  in 
congenital hypothyroidism.
Diagnosis and Treatment  Because of the severe neurologic con-
sequences of untreated congenital hypothyroidism, neonatal screening 
programs  have  been  established.  These  are  generally  based  on  mea-
surement of TSH or T4 levels in heel-prick blood specimens. When the 
diagnosis is confirmed, T4 is instituted at a dose of 10–15 μg/kg per d, 
and the dose is adjusted by close monitoring of TSH levels. T4 require-
ments are relatively great during the first year of life, and a high cir-
culating T4 level is usually needed to normalize TSH. Early treatment 
with  T4  results  in  normal  IQ  levels,  but  subtle  neurodevelopmental 
abnormalities may occur in those with the most severe hypothyroidism 
at diagnosis or when treatment is delayed or suboptimal. If transient 
hypothyroidism is suspected, or the diagnosis is unclear, treatment can 
be stopped safely after the age of 3 years followed by further evaluation.
 ■ AUTOIMMUNE HYPOTHYROIDISM
Classification  Autoimmune  hypothyroidism  may  be  associated 
with a goiter (Hashimoto’s, or goitrous thyroiditis) or minimal residual 
thyroid tissue (atrophic thyroiditis). Because the autoimmune process 
gradually reduces thyroid function, there is a phase of compensation 
when normal thyroid hormone levels are maintained by a rise in TSH. 
Although some patients may have minor symptoms, this state is called 
subclinical hypothyroidism. Later, unbound T4 levels fall and TSH levels 
rise  further;  symptoms  become  more  readily  apparent  at  this  stage 
(usually TSH >10 mIU/L), which is referred to as clinical hypothyroid-
ism or overt hypothyroidism.

Prevalence  The mean annual incidence rate of autoimmune hypo-
thyroidism is up to 4 per 1000 women and 1 per 1000 men. It is more 
common in certain populations, such as the Japanese, probably because 
of  genetic  factors  and  chronic  exposure  to  a  high-iodine  diet.  The 
mean age at diagnosis is 60 years, and the prevalence of overt hypo-
thyroidism increases with age. Subclinical hypothyroidism is found in 
6–8% of women (10% over the age of 60) and 3% of men. The annual 
risk  of  developing  clinical  hypothyroidism  is  ~4%  when  subclinical 
hypothyroidism is associated with positive thyroid peroxidase (TPO) 
antibodies.

Pathogenesis 
In  Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis,  there  is  a  marked  lym-
phocytic  infiltration  of  the  thyroid  with  germinal  center  formation, 
atrophy  of  the  thyroid  follicles  accompanied  by  oxyphil  metaplasia, 
absence  of  colloid,  and  mild  to  moderate  fibrosis.  In  atrophic  thy-
roiditis,  the  fibrosis  is  much  more  extensive,  lymphocyte  infiltration 
is less pronounced, and thyroid follicles are almost completely absent. 
Atrophic  thyroiditis  usually  represents  the  end  stage  of  Hashimoto’s 
thyroiditis  rather  than  a  separate  disorder,  although  a  distinct  form 
of marked fibrosis occurs in which the gland is infiltrated with IgG4- 
positive plasma cells.

As with most autoimmune disorders, susceptibility to autoimmune 
hypothyroidism is determined by a combination of genetic and envi-
ronmental factors, and the risk of either autoimmune hypothyroidism 
or  Graves’  disease  is  increased  among  siblings.  HLA-DR  polymor-
phisms are the best documented genetic risk factors for autoimmune 
hypothyroidism,  especially  HLA-DR3,  DR4,  and  DR5  in  Caucasians. 
A  weak  association  also  exists  between  polymorphisms  in  CTLA-4, 
a  T  cell–regulatory  gene,  and  autoimmune  hypothyroidism.  Both  of 
these  genetic  associations  are  shared  by  other  autoimmune  diseases, 
which  may  explain  the  relationship  between  autoimmune  hypothy-
roidism  and  other  autoimmune  diseases,  especially  type  1  diabetes 
mellitus, Addison’s disease, pernicious anemia, and vitiligo. HLA-DR 
and  CTLA-4  polymorphisms  account  for  approximately  half  of  the

genetic  susceptibility  to  autoimmune  hypothyroidism,  and  the  role 
of other contributory loci remains to be clarified. A gene on chromo-
some 21 may be responsible for the association between autoimmune 
hypothyroidism and Down’s syndrome. The female preponderance of 
thyroid autoimmunity is most likely due to sex steroid effects on the 
immune response, but an X chromosome–related genetic factor is also 
possible and may account for the high frequency of autoimmune hypo-
thyroidism in Turner’s syndrome. Environmental susceptibility factors 
are  poorly  defined  at  present.  A  high  iodine  or  low  selenium  intake 
and decreased exposure to microorganisms in childhood increase the 
risk  of  autoimmune  hypothyroidism.  Smoking  cessation  transiently

increases  incidence,  whereas  alcohol  intake  seems  protective.  These 
factors may account for the increase in prevalence over the past two 
to three decades.

The  thyroid  lymphocytic  infiltrate  in  autoimmune  hypothyroid-
ism  is  composed  of  activated  T  cells  as  well  as  B  cells.  Thyroid  cell 
destruction is primarily mediated by the CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but 
local  production  of  cytokines,  such  as  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF), 
interleukin-1  (IL-1),  and  interferon  γ  (IFN-γ),  derived  from  the 
inflammatory  infiltrate  may  render  thyroid  cells  more  susceptible  to 
apoptosis mediated by death receptors, such as Fas, and by oxidative 
stress.  These  cytokines  also  impair  thyroid  cell  function  directly  and 
induce the expression of other proinflammatory molecules by the thy-
roid cells themselves, such as cytokines, HLA class I and class II mol-
ecules, adhesion molecules, CD40, and nitric oxide. Administration of 
high concentrations of cytokines for therapeutic purposes (especially 
IFN-α) is associated with increased autoimmune thyroid disease, pos-
sibly through mechanisms similar to those in sporadic disease. Novel 
anticancer and immunomodulatory treatments, such as tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and alemtuzumab, can also 
induce thyroiditis via their effects on T-cell regulation.

Antibodies  to  TPO  and  thyroglobulin  (Tg)  are  clinically  useful 
markers of thyroid autoimmunity, but any pathogenic effect is restricted 
to  a  secondary  role  in  amplifying  an  ongoing  autoimmune  response. 
TPO  antibodies  fix  complement,  and  complement  membrane-attack 
complexes are present in the thyroid in autoimmune hypothyroidism. 
However, transplacental passage of Tg or TPO antibodies has no effect 
on  the  fetal  thyroid,  which  suggests  that  T  cell–mediated  injury  is 
required to initiate autoimmune damage to the thyroid.

Up to 20% of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism have anti-
bodies  against  the  TSH-R,  which,  in  contrast  to  thyroid-stimulating 
immunoglobulin (TSI), do not stimulate the receptor but prevent the 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   2934

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismbinding  of  TSH.  These  TSH-R-blocking  antibodies,  therefore,  cause 
hypothyroidism  and,  especially  in  Asian  patients,  thyroid  atrophy. 
Their transplacental passage may induce transient neonatal hypothy-
roidism.  Rarely,  patients  have  a  mixture  of  TSI  and  TSH-R-blocking 
antibodies, and thyroid function can oscillate between hyperthyroid-
ism and hypothyroidism as one or the other antibody becomes dom-
inant. Predicting the course of disease in such individuals is difficult, 
and they require close monitoring of thyroid function. Bioassays can 
be used to document that TSH-R-blocking antibodies reduce the cyclic 
AMP–inducing effect of TSH on cultured TSH-R-expressing cells, but 
these  assays  are  difficult  to  perform.  Thyrotropin-binding  inhibitory 
immunoglobulin (TBII) assays that measure the binding of antibodies 
to  the  receptor  by  competition  with  labeled  TSH  do  not  distinguish 
between TSI and TSH-R-blocking antibodies, but a positive result in 
a patient with spontaneous hypothyroidism is strong evidence for the 
presence of blocking antibodies. The use of these assays does not gen-
erally alter clinical management, although it may be useful to confirm 
the cause of transient neonatal hypothyroidism.

Clinical  Manifestations  The  main  clinical  features  of  hypothy-
roidism are summarized in Table 383-3. The onset is usually insidious, 
and  the  patient  may  become  aware  of  symptoms  only  when  euthy-
roidism is restored. Patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis may present 
because of goiter rather than symptoms of hypothyroidism. The goiter 
may  not  be  large,  but  it  is  usually  irregular  and  firm  in  consistency. 
Rarely, uncomplicated Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is associated with pain.
Patients  with  atrophic  thyroiditis  or  the  later  stage  of  Hashimoto’s 
thyroiditis present with symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. The 
skin  is  dry,  and  there  is  decreased  sweating,  thinning  of  the  epider-
mis,  and  hyperkeratosis  of  the  stratum  corneum.  Increased  dermal 
glycosaminoglycan content traps water, giving rise to skin thickening 
without pitting (myxedema). Typical features include a puffy face with 
edematous eyelids and nonpitting pretibial edema (Fig. 383-1). There 
is pallor, often with a yellow tinge to the skin due to carotene accumula-
tion. Nail growth is retarded, and hair is dry, brittle, difficult to manage, 
and falls out easily. In addition to diffuse alopecia, there is thinning of 
the outer third of the eyebrows, although this is not a specific sign of 
hypothyroidism.

Other  common  features  include  constipation  and  weight  gain 
(despite a poor appetite). In contrast to popular perception, the weight 
gain is usually modest and due mainly to fluid retention in the myxede-
matous  tissues.  Libido  is  decreased  in  both  sexes,  and  there  may  be 
oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in long-standing disease, but menor-
rhagia may occur at an early stage. Fertility is reduced, and the inci-
dence of miscarriage is increased. Prolactin levels are often modestly 
increased (Chap. 380) and may contribute to alterations in libido and 
fertility and cause galactorrhea.

Myocardial  contractility  and  pulse  rate  are  reduced,  leading  to  a 
reduced  stroke  volume  and  bradycardia.  Increased  peripheral  resis-
tance  may  be  accompanied  by  hypertension,  particularly  diastolic. 
Blood flow is diverted from the skin, producing cool extremities. Peri-
cardial effusions occur in up to 30% of patients but rarely compromise 
cardiac function. Although alterations in myosin heavy chain isoform 
expression have been documented, cardiomyopathy is rare. Fluid may 
also accumulate in other serous cavities and in the middle ear, giving 
rise  to  conductive  deafness;  sensorineural  deafness  may  also  occur. 
Pulmonary function is generally normal, but dyspnea may be caused 
by pleural effusion, impaired respiratory muscle function, diminished 
ventilatory drive, or sleep apnea.

Carpal tunnel and other entrapment syndromes are common, as is 
impairment  of  muscle  function  with  stiffness,  cramps,  and  pain.  On 
examination, there may be slow relaxation of tendon reflexes and pseu-
domyotonia. Memory and concentration are impaired. Experimentally, 
positron emission tomography (PET) scans examining glucose metab-
olism in hypothyroid subjects show lower regional activity in the amyg-
dala,  hippocampus,  and  perigenual  anterior  cingulate  cortex,  among 
other  regions,  and  this  activity  corrects  after  thyroxine  replacement. 
Rare neurologic problems include reversible cerebellar ataxia, demen-
tia,  psychosis,  and  myxedema  coma.  Hashimoto’s  encephalopathy  has 
been  defined  as  a  steroid-responsive  syndrome  associated  with  TPO 
antibodies, myoclonus, and slow-wave activity on electroencephalog-
raphy, but the relationship with thyroid autoimmunity or hypothyroid-
ism is not established, and if a patient is euthyroid, levothyroxine (LT4) 
therapy has not been shown to be efficacious in treatment. The hoarse 
voice and occasionally clumsy speech of hypothyroidism reflect fluid 
accumulation in the vocal cords and tongue.

The  features  described  above  are  the  consequence  of  thyroid  hor-
mone  deficiency.  However,  autoimmune  hypothyroidism  may  be 
associated  with  signs  or  symptoms  of  other  autoimmune  diseases, 
particularly  vitiligo,  pernicious  anemia,  Addison’s  disease  (Schmidt’s 
syndrome), alopecia areata, and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In 
the polygenic disorder autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2, 
autoimmune thyroid disease is present in 70–75%, T1DM in 40–60%, 
and  Addison’s  disease  in  40–50%.  Less  common  associations  include 
celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic active hepatitis, rheu-
matoid  arthritis,  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE),  myasthenia 
gravis,  autoimmune  hypoparathyroidism,  primary  hypogonadism, 
and  Sjögren’s  syndrome.  Thyroid-associated  ophthalmopathy  usually 
occurs in Graves’ disease (see below), but in ~5% of patients, it is asso-
ciated with autoimmune hypothyroidism.

Autoimmune hypothyroidism is uncommon in children and usually 
presents  with  slow  growth  and  delayed  facial  and  dental  maturation. 
The pituitary may be enlarged due to thyrotroph hyperplasia. Myopa-
thy, with muscle swelling, is more common in children than in adults. 
In most cases, puberty is delayed, but precocious puberty sometimes 
occurs. There may be intellectual impairment if the onset is before 3 
years and the hormone deficiency is severe.

Laboratory Evaluation  A summary of the investigations used to 
determine  the  existence  and  cause  of  hypothyroidism  is  provided  in 
Fig. 383-2. A normal TSH level excludes primary (but not secondary) 
hypothyroidism. If the TSH is elevated, a free or unbound T4 level (FT4) 
is needed to confirm the presence of clinical hypothyroidism, but T4 is 
inferior to TSH when used as a screening test because it will not detect 
subclinical hypothyroidism. Circulating unbound T3 levels are normal 
in ~25% of patients, reflecting adaptive deiodinase responses to hypo-
thyroidism. T3 measurements are, therefore, not indicated.

Once  clinical  or  subclinical  hypothyroidism  is  confirmed,  the 
etiology  is  usually  easily  established  by  demonstrating  the  presence 
of  TPO  and  Tg  antibodies,  which  are  present  in  >95%  of  patients 
with  autoimmune  hypothyroidism.  TBII  can  be  found  in  10–20%  of 
patients,  but  measurement  is  not  needed  routinely.  Other  abnormal 
laboratory findings in hypothyroidism may include increased creatine 
phosphokinase,  elevated  cholesterol  and  triglycerides,  and  anemia 
(usually normocytic or macrocytic). Except when accompanied by iron 
deficiency, the anemia and other abnormalities gradually resolve with 
thyroxine replacement.

Differential  Diagnosis  An  asymmetric  goiter  in  Hashimoto’s 
thyroiditis  may  be  confused  with  a  multinodular  goiter  (MNG)  or 
thyroid  carcinoma,  in  which  thyroid  antibodies  may  also  be  present. 
Ultrasound  can  be  used  to  show  the  presence  of  a  solitary  lesion  or 
an  MNG  rather  than  the  thyroid  enlargement  with  heterogeneous 
echogenicity typical of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Fine-needle aspiration 
biopsy  is  useful  in  the  investigation  of  focal  nodules.  Other  causes 
of hypothyroidism are discussed below and in Table 383-1 but rarely 
cause diagnostic confusion.

 ■ OTHER CAUSES OF HYPOTHYROIDISM
Iatrogenic hypothyroidism is a common cause of hypothyroidism and 
can  often  be  detected  by  screening  before  symptoms  develop.  In  the 
first 3–4 months after radioiodine treatment for Graves’ disease, tran-
sient  hypothyroidism  may  occur  due  to  reversible  radiation  damage. 
Low-dose  thyroxine  treatment  can  be  withdrawn  if  recovery  occurs. 
Because  TSH  levels  are  suppressed  by  hyperthyroidism,  unbound  T4 
levels are a better measure of thyroid function than TSH in the months 
following  radioiodine  treatment.  Mild  hypothyroidism  after  subtotal 
thyroidectomy  may  also  resolve  after  several  months,  as  the  gland 
remnant is stimulated by increased TSH levels.

Iodine  deficiency  is  responsible  for  endemic  goiter  and  cretinism 
but is an uncommon cause of adult hypothyroidism unless the iodine 
intake is very low or there are complicating factors, such as the con-
sumption of thiocyanates in cassava or selenium deficiency. Although 
hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency can be treated with thyroxine, 
public health measures to improve iodine intake should be advocated 
to eliminate this problem. Iodized salt or bread or a single bolus of oral 
or intramuscular iodized oil have all been used successfully.

Paradoxically,  chronic  iodine  excess  can  also  induce  goiter  and 
hypothyroidism.  The  intracellular  events  that  account  for  this  effect 
are unclear, but individuals with autoimmune thyroiditis are especially 

susceptible.  Iodine  excess  is  responsible  for  the  hypothyroidism  that 
occurs in patients treated with amiodarone (Chap. 384). Other drugs, 
particularly lithium, may also cause hypothyroidism. Transient hypo-
thyroidism caused by thyroiditis is discussed below.

Secondary  or  central  hypothyroidism  is  usually  diagnosed  in  the 
context of other anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies; isolated TSH 
deficiency  is  very  rare  (Chap.  379).  TSH  levels  may  be  low,  normal, 
or  even  slightly  increased  in  secondary  hypothyroidism;  the  latter  is 
due to secretion of immunoactive but bioinactive forms of TSH. The 
diagnosis is confirmed by detecting a low unbound T4 level. The goal 
of treatment is to maintain T4 levels in the upper half of the reference 
interval because TSH levels cannot be used to monitor therapy.

TREATMENT
Hypothyroidism 

CLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM
If there is no residual thyroid function, the daily replacement dose 
of LT4 is usually 1.6 μg/kg body weight (typically 100–150 μg), ide-
ally taken at least 30 min before breakfast. In many patients, how-
ever, lower doses suffice until residual thyroid tissue is destroyed. In 
patients who develop hypothyroidism after the treatment of Graves’ 
disease, there is often underlying autonomous function, necessitat-
ing lower replacement doses (typically 75–125 μg/d).

Adult  patients  under  60  years  old  without  evidence  of  heart 
disease  may  be  started  on  50–100  μg  of  LT4  daily.  The  dose  is 
adjusted  on  the  basis  of  TSH  levels,  with  the  goal  of  treatment 
being  a  normal  TSH,  ideally  in  the  lower  half  of  the  reference 
range. TSH responses are gradual and should be measured about 2 
months after instituting treatment or after any subsequent change 
in LT4 dosage. The clinical effects of LT4 replacement are slow to 
appear. Patients may not experience full relief from symptoms until  
3–6  months  after  normal  TSH  levels  are  restored.  Adjustment  of 
LT4 dosage is made in 12.5- or 25-μg increments if the TSH is high; 
decrements of the same magnitude should be made if the TSH is 
suppressed. Patients with a suppressed TSH of any cause, including 
LT4 overtreatment, have an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and 
reduced bone density.

About 10–15% of patients may have persistent symptoms despite 
restoration  of  euthyroidism  with  LT4  for  reasons  that  remain 
unclear. Although desiccated animal thyroid preparations (thyroid 
extract USP) are available, they are not recommended because the 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   2936

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismratio of T3 to T4 is nonphysiologic. The use of LT4 combined with 
liothyronine (triiodothyronine, T3) has been investigated, but bene-
fit has not been confirmed in prospective studies. There is no place 
for liothyronine alone as long-term replacement, because the short 
half-life necessitates three or four daily doses and is associated with 
fluctuating T3 levels.

Once  full  replacement  is  achieved  and  TSH  levels  are  stable,   

follow-up  measurement  of  TSH  is  recommended  at  annual  inter-
vals. It is important to ensure ongoing adherence as patients do not 
feel any symptomatic difference after missing a few doses of LT4, 
and this sometimes leads to self-discontinuation.

In  patients  of  normal  body  weight  who  are  taking  ≥200  μg  of 
LT4 per d, an elevated TSH level is often a sign of poor adherence 
to treatment. This is also the likely explanation for fluctuating TSH 
levels, despite a constant LT4 dosage. Such patients often have nor-
mal  or  high  unbound  T4  levels,  despite  an  elevated  TSH,  because 
they  remember  to  take  medication  for  a  few  days  before  testing; 
this is sufficient to normalize T4, but not TSH levels. It is important 
to  consider  variable  adherence,  because  this  pattern  of  thyroid 
function tests is otherwise suggestive of disorders associated with 
inappropriate  TSH  secretion  (Chap.  382).  Because  T4  has  a  long 
half-life (7 days), patients who miss a dose can be advised to take 
two doses of the skipped tablets at once. Other causes of increased 
LT4  requirements  must  be  excluded,  particularly  malabsorption 
(e.g.,  celiac  disease,  small-bowel  surgery,  atrophic  or  Helicobacter 
pylori–related  gastritis),  oral  estrogen-containing  medications  or 
selective  estrogen  receptor  modulator  therapy,  ingestion  with  a 
meal,  and  drugs  that  interfere  with  T4  absorption  or  metabolism 
such as bile acid sequestrants, ferrous sulfate, calcium supplements, 
sevelamer, sucralfate, proton pump inhibitors, lovastatin, aluminum 
hydroxide, rifampicin, amiodarone, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 

SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM
By definition, subclinical hypothyroidism refers to biochemical evi-
dence of thyroid hormone deficiency in patients who have few or no 
apparent clinical features of hypothyroidism. There are no univer-
sally accepted recommendations for the management of subclinical 
hypothyroidism, but LT4 is recommended if the patient is a woman 
who  wishes  to  conceive  or  is  pregnant  or  when  TSH  levels  are   
>10 mIU/L. Most other patients can simply be monitored annually. 
A trial of treatment may be considered when young or middle-aged 
patients have symptoms of hypothyroidism or risk of heart disease. 
It  is  important  to  confirm  that  any  elevation  of  TSH  is  sustained 
over  a  3-month  period  before  treatment  is  given.  Treatment  is 
administered by starting with a low dose of LT4 (25–50 μg/d) with 
the goal of normalizing TSH. 

SPECIAL TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS
Rarely,  LT4  replacement  is  associated  with  pseudotumor  cerebri 
in  children.  Presentation  appears  to  be  idiosyncratic  and  occurs 
months after treatment has begun.

Because  maternal  hypothyroidism  may  both  adversely  affect 
fetal neural development and be associated with adverse gestational 
outcomes (miscarriage, preterm delivery), thyroid function should 
be monitored to preserve euthyroidism in women with a history or 
high risk of hypothyroidism. Although epidemiologic studies have 
demonstrated the association of miscarriage and preterm delivery 
with  the  presence  of  thyroid  autoantibodies  detected  either  dur-
ing  or  prior  to  gestation,  randomized  controlled  trails  evaluating 
LT4  therapy  in  this  population  have  not  demonstrated  benefit. 
Because  of  the  known  increase  in  thyroid  hormone  requirements 
during  pregnancy  in  hypothyroid  women,  LT4  therapy  should 
be  targeted  to  maintain  a  serum  TSH  in  the  normal  range  but   
<2.5  mIU/L  prior  to  conception.  Subsequently,  thyroid  function 
should be evaluated immediately after pregnancy is confirmed and 
every 4 weeks during the first half of the pregnancy, with less fre-
quent testing after 20 weeks’ gestation (every 6–8 weeks depending 
on  whether  LT4  dose  adjustment  is  ongoing).  The  increment  of

LT4 dosage increase depends upon the etiology of hypothyroidism, 
with  athyreotic  women  requiring  more  (~45%)  than  those  with 
Hashimoto’s who may have some residual thyroid function. Women 
should increase LT4 from once-daily dosing to nine doses per week 
as soon as pregnancy is confirmed to anticipate this change. There-
after  dosage  should  be  closely  monitored  with  a  goal  TSH  in  the 
lower half of the trimester-specific normative range, if available, or  
<2.5  mIU/L  which  allows  for  reserve  if  additional  LT4  dosage 
increases  are  required  as  pregnancy  progresses.  However,  it  is 
important  to  recognize  that  the  normal  TSH  range  in  pregnancy 
for  the  second  and  third  trimesters  is  not  significantly  different 
from  the  nonpregnancy  reference  range.  However,  serum  TSH 
decreases in the late first trimester, and if trimester-specific ranges 
are not available, an appropriate range for 7–12 weeks’ gestation can 
be approximated by decreasing the upper limit of the nonpregnant 
reference range by 0.5 mIU/L (~4.0 mIU/L) and the lower limit by 
0.4 mIU/L (~0.1 mIU/L).

After delivery, LT4 doses typically return to prepregnancy levels. 
Pregnant women should be counseled to separate ingestion of pre-
natal vitamins and iron supplements from LT4.

Elderly  patients  may  require  20%  less  thyroxine  than  younger 
patients.  In  the  elderly,  especially  patients  with  known  coronary 
artery disease, the starting dose of LT4 is 12.5–25 μg/d with similar 
increments  every  2–3  months  until  TSH  is  normalized.  In  some 
patients,  it  may  be  impossible  to  achieve  full  replacement  despite 
optimal antianginal treatment. Emergency surgery is generally safe 
in  patients  with  untreated  hypothyroidism,  although  routine  sur-
gery in a hypothyroid patient should be deferred until euthyroidism 
is achieved.

Myxedema coma still has a 20–40% mortality rate, despite inten-
sive treatment, and outcomes are independent of the T4 and TSH 
levels.  Clinical  manifestations  include  reduced  level  of  conscious-
ness,  sometimes  associated  with  seizures,  as  well  as  the  other 
features of hypothyroidism (Table 383-3). Hypothermia can reach 
23°C (74°F). There may be a history of treated hypothyroidism with 
poor  compliance,  or  the  patient  may  be  previously  undiagnosed. 
Myxedema  coma  almost  always  occurs  in  the  elderly  and  is  usu-
ally  precipitated  by  factors  that  impair  respiration,  such  as  drugs 
(especially  sedatives,  anesthetics,  and  antidepressants),  pneumo-
nia, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal 
bleeding,  or  cerebrovascular  accidents.  Sepsis  should  also  be  sus-
pected. Exposure to cold may also be a risk factor. Hypoventilation, 
leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia, plays a major role in pathogen-
esis; hypoglycemia and dilutional hyponatremia also contribute to 
the development of myxedema coma.

LT4  can  initially  be  administered  as  a  single  IV  bolus  of   
200–400  μg,  which  serves  as  a  loading  dose,  followed  by  a  daily 
oral  dose  of  1.6  μg/kg  per  d,  reduced  by  25%  if  administered  IV. 
If suitable IV preparation is not available, the same initial dose of 
LT4 can be given by nasogastric tube (although absorption may be 
impaired in myxedema). Because T4 → T3 conversion is impaired 
in myxedema coma, there is a rationale for adding liothyronine (T3) 
intravenously  or  via  nasogastric  tube  to  LT4  treatment,  although 
excess  liothyronine  has  the  potential  to  provoke  arrhythmias.  An 
initial loading dose of 5–20 μg liothyronine should be followed by 
2.5–10 μg every 8 h, with lower doses chosen for smaller or older 
patients and those at cardiovascular risk.

Supportive therapy should be provided to correct any associated 
metabolic disturbances. External warming is indicated only if the 
temperature  is  <30°C,  as  it  can  result  in  cardiovascular  collapse 
(Chap.  464).  Space  blankets  should  be  used  to  prevent  further 
heat  loss.  Parenteral  hydrocortisone  (50  mg  every  6  h)  should  be 
administered  because  there  is  impaired  adrenal  reserve  in  pro-
found hypothyroidism. Any precipitating factors should be treated, 
including the early use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, pending the 
exclusion of infection. Ventilatory support with regular blood gas 
analysis is usually needed during the first 48 h. Hypertonic saline 
or  IV  glucose  may  be  needed  if  there  is  severe  hyponatremia  or 
hypoglycemia; hypotonic IV fluids should be avoided because they

2938 may exacerbate water retention secondary to reduced renal perfu-
sion  and  inappropriate  vasopressin  secretion.  The  metabolism  of 
most  medications  is  impaired,  and  sedatives  should  be  avoided  if 
possible or used in reduced doses. Medication blood levels should 
be monitored, when available, to guide dosage.

Other Causes of 
Thyrotoxicosis

Anthony P. Weetman

THYROTOXICOSIS
Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the state of thyroid hormone excess and is 
not synonymous with hyperthyroidism, which is the result of excessive 
thyroid  function.  However,  the  major  etiologies  of  thyrotoxicosis  are 
hyperthyroidism caused by Graves’ disease, toxic multinodular goiter 
(MNG), and toxic adenomas. Other causes are listed in Table 384-1.
 ■ GRAVES’ DISEASE
Epidemiology  Graves’  disease  accounts  for  60–80%  of  thyrotox-
icosis.  The  prevalence  varies  among  populations,  reflecting  genetic 
factors  and  iodine  intake  (high  iodine  intake  is  associated  with  an 
increased prevalence of Graves’ disease). Graves’ disease occurs in up 
to  2%  of  women  but  is  one-tenth  as  frequent  in  men.  The  disorder 
rarely begins before adolescence and typically occurs between 20 and 
50 years of age; it also occurs in the elderly.

Pathogenesis  As  in  autoimmune  hypothyroidism,  a  combination 
of  environmental  and  genetic  factors,  including  polymorphisms  in 
HLA-DR,  the  immunoregulatory  genes  CTLA-4,  CD25,  PTPN22, 
FCRL3,  and  CD226,  as  well  as  the  gene  encoding  the  thyroid-stim-
ulating  hormone  (TSH)  receptor  (TSH-R),  contributes  to  Graves’ 
disease  susceptibility.  The  concordance  for  Graves’  disease  in  mono-
zygotic twins is 20–30%, compared to <5% in dizygotic twins. Indirect 
evidence  suggests  that  stress  is  an  important  environmental  factor, 
presumably operating through neuroendocrine effects on the immune 
system. Smoking is a minor risk factor for Graves’ disease and a major 
risk factor for the development of ophthalmopathy. Sudden increases 
in iodine intake may precipitate Graves’ disease, and there is a threefold 
increase in the occurrence of Graves’ disease in the postpartum period. 
Graves’  disease  may  occur  during  the  immune  reconstitution  phase 
after  highly  active  antiretroviral  therapy  (HAART)  or  alemtuzumab 
treatment and following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(e.g., nivolumab, pembrolizumab).

Abbreviation: TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone.

The  hyperthyroidism  of  Graves’  disease  is  caused  by  thyroid- 
stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs) that are synthesized by lympho-
cytes in the thyroid gland as well as in bone marrow and lymph nodes. 
Such  antibodies  can  be  detected  by  bioassays  or  by  using  the  more 
widely available immunoassays (TSH receptor antibody [TRAb]) that 
measure  whether  the  patient’s  serum  contains  an  antibody  that  can 
displace  either  labeled  TSH  or  a  monoclonal  TSH  receptor  antibody 
from the TSH receptor. The presence of TRAb in a patient with thy-
rotoxicosis implies the existence of TSI, and these assays are useful in 
monitoring pregnant Graves’ patients in whom high levels of TSI can 
cross  the  placenta  and  cause  neonatal  thyrotoxicosis.  Other  thyroid 
autoimmune responses, similar to those in autoimmune hypothyroid-
ism (see above), occur concurrently in patients with Graves’ disease. In 
particular, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) antibod-
ies occur in up to 80% of cases. Because the coexisting thyroiditis can 
also affect thyroid function, there is no direct correlation between the 
level of TSI and thyroid hormone levels in Graves’ disease.

Cytokines appear to play a major role in thyroid-associated ophthal-
mopathy. There is infiltration of the extraocular muscles by activated 
T  cells;  the  release  of  cytokines  such  as  interferon  γ  (IFN-γ),  tumor 
necrosis  factor  (TNF),  and  interleukin  1  (IL-1)  results  in  fibroblast 
activation  and  increased  synthesis  of  glycosaminoglycans  that  trap 
water,  thereby  leading  to  characteristic  muscle  swelling.  Late  in  the 
disease, there is irreversible fibrosis of the muscles. Increased fat is an 
additional cause of retrobulbar tissue expansion. The increase in intra-
orbital pressure can lead to proptosis, diplopia, and optic neuropathy. 
Although  the  pathogenesis  of  thyroid-associated  ophthalmopathy  is 
incompletely  understood,  the  TSH-R  is  a  thyroid  autoantigen  and  is 
expressed in orbital tissues. In addition, aberrant signaling via insulin-
like growth factor 1 receptors (IGF-1R) on orbital fibroblasts has also 
been implicated. These mechanisms are the basis for new monoclonal 
antibody  treatments  (e.g.,  teprotumumab)  that  reduce  the  levels  of 
TSH-R/IGF-1R complexes and attenuate signaling.

Clinical  Manifestations  Signs  and  symptoms  include  features 
that are common to any cause of thyrotoxicosis (Table 384-2) as well 
as those specific for Graves’ disease. The clinical presentation depends 
on  the  severity  of  thyrotoxicosis,  the  duration  of  disease,  individual 
susceptibility to excess thyroid hormone, and the patient’s age. In the

elderly, features of thyrotoxicosis may be subtle or masked, and patients 
may present mainly with fatigue and weight loss, a condition known as 
apathetic thyrotoxicosis.

Thyrotoxicosis  may  cause  unexplained  weight  loss,  despite  an 
enhanced  appetite,  due  to  the  increased  metabolic  rate.  Weight  gain 
occurs  in  5%  of  patients,  however,  because  of  increased  food  intake. 
Other  prominent  features  include  hyperactivity,  nervousness,  and 
irritability,  ultimately  leading  to  a  sense  of  easy  fatigability  in  some 
patients. Insomnia and impaired concentration are common; apathetic 
thyrotoxicosis  may  be  mistaken  for  depression  in  the  elderly.  Fine 
tremor  is  a  frequent  finding,  best  elicited  by  having  patients  stretch 
out their fingers while feeling the fingertips with the palm. Common 
neurologic manifestations include hyperreflexia, muscle wasting, and 
proximal  myopathy  without  fasciculation.  Chorea  is  rare.  Thyrotox-
icosis  is  sometimes  associated  with  a  form  of  hypokalemic  periodic 
paralysis;  this  disorder  is  particularly  common  in  Asian  males  with 
thyrotoxicosis, but it occurs in other ethnic groups as well.

The most common cardiovascular manifestation is sinus tachycardia, 
often associated with palpitations, occasionally caused by supraventric-
ular tachycardia. The high cardiac output produces a bounding pulse, 
widened pulse pressure, and an aortic systolic murmur and can lead to 
worsening of angina or heart failure in the elderly or those with pre-
existing  heart  disease.  Atrial  fibrillation  is  more  common  in  patients 
>50 years of age. Treatment of the thyrotoxic state alone converts atrial 
fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm in about half of patients, suggesting 
the existence of an underlying cardiac problem in the remainder.

The skin is usually warm and moist, and the patient may complain 
of  sweating  and  heat  intolerance,  particularly  during  warm  weather. 
Palmar erythema, onycholysis, and, less commonly, pruritus, urticaria, 
and  diffuse  hyperpigmentation  may  be  evident.  Hair  texture  may 
become  fine,  and  a  diffuse  alopecia  occurs  in  up  to  40%  of  patients, 
persisting for months after restoration of euthyroidism. Gastrointesti-
nal transit time is decreased, leading to increased stool frequency, often 
with  diarrhea  and  occasionally  mild  steatorrhea.  Women  frequently 
experience  oligomenorrhea  or  amenorrhea;  in  men,  there  may  be 
impaired sexual function and, rarely, gynecomastia. The direct effect 
of thyroid hormones on bone resorption leads to osteopenia in long-
standing  thyrotoxicosis;  mild  hypercalcemia  occurs  in  up  to  20%  of 
patients, but hypercalciuria is more common. There is a small increase 
in fracture rate in patients with a previous history of thyrotoxicosis.

In Graves’ disease, the thyroid is usually diffusely enlarged to two to 
three times its normal size. The consistency is firm, but not nodular. 
There may be a thrill or bruit, best detected at the inferolateral margins 
of the thyroid lobes, due to the increased vascularity of the gland and 
the hyperdynamic circulation.

Lid retraction, causing a staring appearance, can occur in any form 
of  thyrotoxicosis  and  is  the  result  of  sympathetic  overactivity.  How-
ever, Graves’ disease is associated with specific eye signs that comprise 
Graves’  ophthalmopathy  (Fig.  384-1A).  This  condition  is  also  called 
thyroid-associated  ophthalmopathy,  because  it  occurs  in  the  absence 
of  hyperthyroidism  in  10%  of  patients.  Most  of  these  individuals 
have  autoimmune  hypothyroidism  or  thyroid  antibodies.  The  onset

of  Graves’  ophthalmopathy  occurs  within  the  year  before  or  after 
the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in 75% of patients but can sometimes 
precede or follow thyrotoxicosis by several years, accounting for some 
cases of euthyroid ophthalmopathy.

About one-third of patients with Graves’ disease have clinical evi-
dence of ophthalmopathy. However, the enlarged extraocular muscles 
typical of the disease, and other subtle features, can be detected in most 
patients  when  investigated  by  ultrasound  or  computed  tomography 
(CT) imaging of the orbits. Unilateral signs are found in up to 10% of 
ophthalmopathy  patients.  The  earliest  manifestations  of  ophthalmo-
pathy are usually a sensation of grittiness, eye discomfort, and excess 
tearing.  About  one-third  of  patients  have  proptosis,  best  detected  by 
visualization of the sclera between the lower border of the iris and the 
lower eyelid, with the eyes in the primary position. Proptosis can be 
measured using an exophthalmometer. In severe cases, proptosis may 
cause corneal exposure and damage, especially if the lids fail to close 
during sleep. Periorbital edema, scleral injection, and chemosis are also 
frequent.  In  5–10%  of  patients,  the  muscle  swelling  is  so  severe  that 
diplopia results, typically, but not exclusively, when the patient looks 
up and laterally. The most serious manifestation is compression of the 
optic nerve at the apex of the orbit, leading to papilledema; peripheral 
field defects; and, if left untreated, permanent loss of vision.

The “NO SPECS” scoring system to evaluate ophthalmopathy is an 

acronym derived from the following changes:

0 = No signs or symptoms
1 = Only signs (lid retraction or lag), no symptoms
2 = Soft tissue involvement (periorbital edema)
3 = Proptosis (>22 mm)
4 = Extraocular muscle involvement (diplopia)
5 = Corneal involvement
6 = Sight loss

Although useful as a mnemonic, the NO SPECS scheme is inade-
quate to describe the eye disease fully, and patients do not necessarily 
progress  from  one  class  to  another;  alternative  scoring  systems  (e.g., 
the  EUGOGO  system  developed  by  the  European  Group  on  Graves’ 
Orbitopathy) that assess disease activity are preferable for monitoring 
and treatment purposes. When Graves’ eye disease is active and severe, 
referral to an ophthalmologist is indicated and objective measurements 
are needed, such as lid-fissure width; corneal staining with fluorescein;

2940 and  evaluation  of  extraocular  muscle  function  (e.g.,  Hess  chart), 

intraocular pressure and visual fields, acuity, and color vision.

Thyroid dermopathy occurs in <5% of patients with Graves’ disease 
(Fig.  384-1B),  almost  always  in  the  presence  of  moderate  or  severe 
ophthalmopathy. Although most frequent over the anterior and lateral 
aspects  of  the  lower  leg  (hence  the  term  pretibial  myxedema),  skin 
changes can occur at other sites, particularly after trauma. The typical 
lesion is a noninflamed, indurated plaque with a deep pink or purple 
color  and  an  “orange  skin”  appearance.  Nodular  involvement  can 
occur, and the condition can rarely extend over the whole lower leg and 
foot,  mimicking  elephantiasis.  Thyroid  acropachy  refers  to  a  form  of 
clubbing found in <1% of patients with Graves’ disease (Fig. 384-1C). 
It is so strongly associated with thyroid dermopathy that an alternative 
cause of clubbing should be sought in a Graves’ patient without coinci-
dent skin and orbital involvement. Ophthalmopathy, dermopathy, and 
acropachy have declined in incidence, probably due to better recogni-
tion and prompt treatment of the underlying thyroid disease.

Laboratory  Evaluation 
Investigations  used  to  determine  the 
existence  and  cause  of  thyrotoxicosis  are  summarized  in  Fig.  384-2. 
In Graves’ disease, the TSH level is suppressed, and total and unbound 
thyroid hormone levels are increased. In 2–5% of patients (and more 
in areas of borderline iodine intake), only T3 is increased (T3 toxicosis). 
The  converse  state  of  T4  toxicosis,  with  elevated  total  and  unbound 
T4  and  normal  T3  levels,  is  occasionally  seen  when  hyperthyroidism 
is  induced  by  excess  iodine,  providing  surplus  substrate  for  thyroid 
hormone synthesis. Measurement of TPO antibodies or TRAb may be 
useful if the diagnosis is unclear clinically but is not needed routinely. 
Associated abnormalities that may cause diagnostic confusion in thy-
rotoxicosis  include  elevation  of  bilirubin,  liver  enzymes,  and  ferritin. 
Microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia may occur.

Differential Diagnosis  Diagnosis of Graves’ disease is straightfor-
ward in a patient with biochemically confirmed thyrotoxicosis, diffuse 

goiter  on  palpation,  ophthalmopathy,  and  often  a  personal  or  family 
history of autoimmune disorders. For patients with thyrotoxicosis who 
lack these features, the diagnosis can be established by a radionuclide 
(99mTc,  123I,  or  131I)  scan  and  uptake  of  the  thyroid,  which  will  distin-
guish the diffuse, high uptake of Graves’ disease from destructive thy-
roiditis, ectopic thyroid tissue, and factitious thyrotoxicosis, as well as 
diagnose a toxic adenoma or toxic MNG. Increasingly, because of the 
rapidity of laboratory test results, TRAb measurement is used instead 
of radionuclide scanning to confirm the diagnosis of Graves’ disease. 
Color-flow Doppler ultrasonography may distinguish between hyper-
thyroidism (with increased blood flow) and destructive thyroiditis. In 
secondary  hyperthyroidism  due  to  a  TSH-secreting  pituitary  tumor, 
there  is  also  a  diffuse  goiter.  The  presence  of  a  nonsuppressed  TSH 
level and the finding of a pituitary tumor on CT or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scan suggest this diagnosis.

Clinical features of thyrotoxicosis can mimic certain aspects of other 
disorders,  including  panic  attacks,  mania,  pheochromocytoma,  and 
weight  loss  associated  with  malignancy.  The  diagnosis  of  thyrotoxi-
cosis can be easily excluded if the TSH and unbound T4 and T3 levels 
are normal. A normal TSH also excludes Graves’ disease as a cause of 
diffuse goiter.

Clinical Course  Clinical  features  generally  worsen without  treat-
ment;  mortality  was  10–30%  before  the  introduction  of  satisfac-
tory  therapy.  Some  patients  with  mild  Graves’  disease  experience 
spontaneous  relapses  and  remissions.  Rarely,  there  may  be  fluctu-
ation  between  hypo-  and  hyperthyroidism  due  to  changes  in  the 
functional  activity  of  TSH-R  antibodies.  About  15%  of  patients 
who  enter  remission  after  treatment  develop  hypothyroidism  
10–15 years later as a result of the destructive autoimmune process.

The  clinical  course  of  ophthalmopathy  does  not  follow  that 
of  the  thyroid  disease,  although  thyroid  dysfunction  can  worsen 
eye  signs.  Ophthalmopathy  typically  worsens  over  the  initial  
3–6 months, followed by a plateau phase over the next 12–18 months,

tissue  changes.  However,  the  course  is  more  fulminant  in  up  to  5% 
of patients, requiring intervention in the acute phase if there is optic 
nerve  compression  or  corneal  ulceration.  Diplopia  may  appear  late 
in the disease due to fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. Radioiodine 
treatment  for  hyperthyroidism  worsens  the  eye  disease  in  a  small 
proportion  of  patients  (especially  smokers).  Antithyroid  drugs  and 
surgery have no adverse effects on the clinical course of ophthalmo-
pathy. Thyroid dermopathy, when it occurs, usually appears 1–2 years 
after  the  development  of  Graves’  hyperthyroidism;  it  may  improve 
spontaneously.

TREATMENT
Graves’ Disease

The hyperthyroidism of Graves’ disease is treated by reducing thy-
roid  hormone  synthesis,  using  an  antithyroid  drug,  or  reducing 
the  amount  of  thyroid  tissue  with  radioiodine  (131I)  treatment  or 
by thyroidectomy. Antithyroid drugs are the predominant therapy 
in  many  centers  in  Europe,  Latin  America,  and  Japan,  whereas 
radioiodine  is  more  often  the  first  line  of  treatment  in  North 
America. These differences reflect the fact that no single approach 
is  optimal  and  that  patients  may  require  multiple  treatments  to 
achieve remission.

The  main  antithyroid  drugs  are  thionamides:  propylthiouracil, 
carbimazole  (not  available  in  the  United  States),  and  the  active 
metabolite  of  the  latter,  methimazole.  All  inhibit  the  function  of 
TPO, reducing oxidation and organification of iodide. These drugs 
also  reduce  thyroid  antibody  levels  by  mechanisms  that  remain 
unclear, and they appear to enhance spontaneous rates of remission. 
Propylthiouracil  inhibits  deiodination  of  T4  →  T3.  However,  this 
effect is of minor benefit, except in the most severe thyrotoxicosis, 
and  is  offset  by  the  much  shorter  half-life  of  this  drug  (90  min) 
compared to methimazole (6 h). Due to the hepatotoxicity of pro-
pylthiouracil,  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  has 
limited  indications  for  its  use  to  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy, 
the  treatment  of  thyroid  storm,  and  patients  with  minor  adverse 
reactions to methimazole. If propylthiouracil is used, monitoring of 
liver function tests is recommended.

There  are  many  variations  of  antithyroid  drug  regimens.  The 
initial  dose  of  carbimazole  or  methimazole  is  usually  10–20  mg 
every 8 or 12 h, but once-daily dosing is possible after euthyroidism 
is restored. Propylthiouracil is given at a dose of 100–200 mg every 
6–8 h, and divided doses are usually given throughout the course. 
Lower doses of each drug may suffice in areas of low iodine intake. 
The starting dose of an antithyroid drug can be gradually reduced 
(titration  regimen)  as  thyrotoxicosis  improves.  Less  commonly, 
high doses may be given combined with levothyroxine (LT4) sup-
plementation (block-replace regimen) to avoid drug-induced hypo-
thyroidism. The titration regimen is preferred to minimize the dose 
of antithyroid drug and provide an index of treatment response.

Thyroid function tests and clinical manifestations are reviewed 
4–6  weeks  after  starting  treatment,  and  the  dose  is  titrated  based 
on unbound T4 levels. Most patients do not achieve euthyroidism 
until 6–8 weeks after treatment is initiated. TSH levels often remain 
suppressed for several months and therefore do not provide a sen-
sitive  index  of  treatment  response.  The  usual  daily  maintenance 
doses of antithyroid drugs in the titration regimen are 2.5–10 mg 
of carbimazole or methimazole and 50–100 mg of propylthiouracil. 
In the block-replace regimen, the initial dose of antithyroid drug is 
held constant, and the dose of LT4 is adjusted to maintain normal 
unbound T4 levels. When TSH suppression is alleviated, TSH levels 
can also be used to monitor therapy.

Maximum remission rates (up to 30–60% in some populations) 
are achieved by 12–18 months for the titration regimen compared 
to  6  months  for  the  block-replace  regimen  and  are  higher  in 
patients in whom TRAb levels are no longer detected than in those 
with TRAb persistence. For unclear reasons, remission rates appear

to  vary  in  different  geographic  regions.  Younger  patients,  males, 
smokers,  and  patients  with  a  history  of  allergy,  severe  hyperthy-
roidism, or large goiters are most likely to relapse when treatment 
stops, but outcomes are difficult to predict. All patients should be 
followed closely for relapse during the first year after treatment and 
at least annually thereafter.

The  common  minor  side  effects  of  antithyroid  drugs  are  rash, 
urticaria,  fever,  and  arthralgia  (1–5%  of  patients).  These  may 
resolve  spontaneously  or  after  substituting  an  alternative  antithy-
roid drug; rashes may respond to an antihistamine. Rare but major 
side effects include hepatitis (especially with propylthiouracil; avoid 
use  in  children)  and  cholestasis  (methimazole  and  carbimazole); 
vasculitis; and, most important, agranulocytosis (<1%). It is essen-
tial that antithyroid drugs are stopped and not restarted if a patient 
develops  major  side  effects.  Written  instructions  should  be  pro-
vided regarding the symptoms of possible agranulocytosis (e.g., sore 
throat, fever, mouth ulcers) and the need to stop treatment pending 
an  urgent  complete  blood  count  to  confirm  that  agranulocytosis 
is  not  present.  Management  of  agranulocytosis  is  described  in   
Chap. 102. It is not useful to monitor blood counts prospectively, 
because the onset of agranulocytosis is idiosyncratic and abrupt.

Propranolol  (20–40  mg  every  6  h)  or  longer-acting  selective  β1 
receptor blockers such as atenolol may be helpful to control adren-
ergic  symptoms,  especially  in  the  early  stages  before  antithyroid 
drugs  take  effect.  Beta  blockers  are  also  useful  in  patients  with 
thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, pending correction of thyrotoxicosis. 
In consultation with a cardiologist, anticoagulation should be con-
sidered in all patients with atrial fibrillation; there is often sponta-
neous reversion to sinus rhythm with control of hyperthyroidism, 
and  long-term  anticoagulation  is  not  usually  needed.  Decreased 
warfarin doses are required when patients are thyrotoxic. If digoxin 
is used, increased doses are often needed in the thyrotoxic state.

Radioiodine  causes  progressive  destruction  of  thyroid  cells  and 
can  be  used  as  initial  treatment  or  for  relapses  after  a  trial  of 
antithyroid  drugs.  There  is  a  small  risk  of  thyrotoxic  crisis  (see 
below)  after  radioiodine,  which  can  be  minimized  by  pretreat-
ment with antithyroid drugs for at least a month before treatment. 
Antecedent treatment with an antithyroid drug and a beta blocker 
should  be  considered  for  all  elderly  patients  or  for  those  with 
cardiac  problems.  Carbimazole  or  methimazole  must  be  stopped   
2–3  days  before  radioiodine  administration  to  achieve  optimum 
iodine  uptake  and  can  be  restarted  3–7  days  after  radioiodine  in 
those at risk of complications from worsening thyrotoxicosis. Pro-
pylthiouracil appears to have a prolonged radioprotective effect and 
should be stopped for a longer period before radioiodine is given, 
or a larger dose of radioiodine will be necessary.

Efforts to calculate an optimal dose of radioiodine that achieves 
euthyroidism without a high incidence of relapse or progression to 
hypothyroidism have not been successful. Some patients inevitably 
relapse after a single dose because the biologic effects of radiation 
vary between individuals, and hypothyroidism cannot be uniformly 
avoided  even  using  accurate  dosimetry.  A  practical  strategy  is  to 
give a fixed dose based on clinical features, such as the severity of 
thyrotoxicosis,  the  size  of  the  goiter  (increases  the  dose  needed), 
and  the  level  of  radioiodine  uptake  (decreases  the  dose  needed). 
131I  dosage  generally  ranges  between  370  MBq  (10  mCi)  and   
555  MBq  (15  mCi).  Most  authorities  favor  an  approach  aimed 
at  thyroid  ablation  (as  opposed  to  euthyroidism),  given  that  LT4 
replacement is straightforward and most patients ultimately prog-
ress to hypothyroidism over 5–10 years, frequently with some delay 
in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

Certain  radiation  safety  precautions  are  necessary  in  the  first 
few days after radioiodine treatment, but the exact guidelines vary 
depending  on  local  protocols.  In  general,  patients  need  to  avoid 
close,  prolonged  contact  with  children  and  pregnant  women  for 
5–7 days because of possible transmission of residual isotope and 
exposure to radiation emanating from the gland. Rarely, there may 
be mild pain due to radiation thyroiditis 1–2 weeks after treatment. 
Hyperthyroidism  can  persist  for  2–3  months  before  radioiodine

takes full effect. For this reason, β-adrenergic blockers or antithy-
roid  drugs  can  be  used  to  control  symptoms  during  this  interval. 
Persistent  hyperthyroidism  can  be  treated  with  a  second  dose  of 
radioiodine, usually 6 months after the first dose. The risk of hypo-
thyroidism after radioiodine depends on the dosage but is at least 
10–20% in the first year and 5% per year thereafter. Patients should 
be informed of this possibility before treatment and require close 
follow-up during the first year followed by annual thyroid function 
testing.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding are absolute contraindications to 
radioiodine  treatment,  but  patients  can  conceive  safely  6  months 
after  treatment.  The  presence  of  ophthalmopathy,  especially 
in  smokers,  requires  caution.  Prednisone,  0.2–0.5  mg/kg  per  d 
(depending on ophthalmopathy severity), at the time of radioiodine 
treatment,  tapered  over  6–12  weeks,  may  prevent  exacerbation  of 
ophthalmopathy,  but  radioiodine  should  generally  be  avoided  in 
patients with active moderate to severe eye disease. Although many 
physicians  avoid  radioiodine  in  children  and  adolescents  because 
of the potential risks of malignancy, others have advocated radioio-
dine use in older children. A recent long-term follow-up study of 
adults found a modest increased lifetime risk of solid cancers after 
radioiodine treatment, contrary to previous findings. It is unclear 
how this will alter management in the future.

Total  or  near-total  thyroidectomy  is  an  option  for  patients  who 
relapse after antithyroid drugs and prefer this treatment to radioio-
dine.  Some  experts  recommend  surgery  in  young  individuals, 
particularly  when  the  goiter  is  very  large.  Careful  control  of  thy-
rotoxicosis  with  antithyroid  drugs,  followed  by  potassium  iodide 
(SSKI; 1–2 drops orally tid for 10 days), is needed prior to surgery 
to  avoid  thyrotoxic  crisis  and  to  reduce  the  vascularity  of  the 
gland.  The  major  complications  of  surgery—bleeding,  laryngeal 
edema, hypoparathyroidism, and damage to the recurrent laryngeal 
nerves—are  unusual  when  the  procedure  is  performed  by  highly 
experienced surgeons. Recurrence rates in the best series are <2%, 
but the rate of hypothyroidism is similar to that following radioio-
dine treatment, especially with the current trend away from subtotal 
thyroidectomy.

Antithyroid  drugs  should  be  used  to  manage  Graves’  disease 
in  pregnancy.  Because  transplacental  passage  of  these  drugs  may 
produce  fetal  hypothyroidism  and  goiter  if  the  maternal  dose  is 
excessive, maternal antithyroid dose titration should target serum 
free or total T4 levels at or just above the pregnancy reference range. 
If  available,  propylthiouracil  should  be  used  until  14–16  weeks’ 
gestation because of the association of rare cases of methimazole/
carbimazole embryopathy, including aplasia cutis and other defects, 
such as choanal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulae. Because of 
the potential for teratogenic effects, recent recommendations sug-
gest discontinuation of antithyroid medication in a newly pregnant 
woman  with  Graves’  disease  who  is  euthyroid  on  a  low  dose  of 
methimazole (<5–10 mg/d) or propylthiouracil (<100–200 mg/d), 
after evaluating recent thyroid function tests, disease history, goi-
ter  size,  duration  of  therapy,  and  TRAb  measurement.  Following 
cessation, careful monitoring of maternal thyroid function tests is 
essential. On the other hand, for women at high risk of developing 
thyrotoxicosis  if  antithyroid  drugs  are  discontinued  (large  goiter, 
requirement  for  higher  antithyroid  drug  dosage),  continued  ther-
apy is necessary, with propylthiouracil (if available) administration 
in the first trimester. However, because of its rare association with 
hepatotoxicity,  propylthiouracil  should  be  limited  to  the  first  tri-
mester and then maternal therapy should be converted to methima-
zole (or carbimazole) at a ratio of 15–20 mg of propylthiouracil to  
1 mg of methimazole. It is often possible to stop treatment in the 
last  trimester  because  TSIs  tend  to  decline  in  pregnancy.  None-
theless, the transplacental transfer of these antibodies if present at 
levels  three  times  higher  than  the  normative  range  rarely  causes 
fetal  or  neonatal  thyrotoxicosis.  Poor  intrauterine  growth,  a  fetal 
heart rate of >160 beats/min, advanced bone age, fetal goiter, and 
high levels of maternal TSI after 26 weeks’ gestation may herald this 
complication. Antithyroid drugs given to the mother can be used 

to treat the fetus and may be needed for 1–3 months after delivery, 
until  the  maternal  antibodies  disappear  from  the  baby’s  circula-
tion. The postpartum period is a time of major risk for relapse of 
Graves’ disease. Breast-feeding is safe with low doses of antithyroid 
drugs. Graves’ disease in children is usually managed initially with 
methimazole  or  carbimazole  (avoid  propylthiouracil),  often  given 
as a prolonged course of the titration regimen. Surgery or radioio-
dine may be indicated for severe or relapsing disease.

Thyrotoxic  crisis,  or  thyroid  storm,  is  rare  and  presents  as  a 
life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, accompanied by 
fever,  delirium,  seizures,  coma,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  and  jaundice. 
The  mortality  rate  due  to  cardiac  failure,  arrhythmia,  or  hyper-
thermia  is  as  high  as  30%,  even  with  treatment.  Thyrotoxic  cri-
sis  is  usually  precipitated  by  acute  illness  (e.g.,  stroke,  infection, 
trauma, diabetic ketoacidosis), surgery (especially on the thyroid), 
or  radioiodine  treatment  of  a  patient  with  partially  treated  or 
untreated  hyperthyroidism.  Management  requires  intensive  mon-
itoring  and  supportive  care,  identification  and  treatment  of  the 
precipitating  cause,  and  measures  that  reduce  thyroid  hormone 
synthesis.  Large  doses  of  propylthiouracil  (500–1000  mg  loading 
dose and 250 mg every 4 h) should be given orally or by nasoga-
stric tube or per rectum; the drug’s inhibitory action on T4 → T3 
conversion makes it the antithyroid drug of choice. If not available, 
methimazole can be used in doses of 20 mg every 6 h. One hour 
after the first dose of propylthiouracil, stable iodide (5 drops SSKI 
every  6  h)  is  given  to  block  thyroid  hormone  synthesis  via  the 
Wolff-Chaikoff effect (the delay allows the antithyroid drug to pre-
vent the excess iodine from being incorporated into new hormone). 
Propranolol should also be given to reduce tachycardia and other 
adrenergic  manifestations  (60–80  mg  PO  every  4  h,  or  2  mg  IV 
every 4 h). Although other β-adrenergic blockers can be used, high 
doses of propranolol decrease T4 → T3 conversion, and the doses 
can  be  easily  adjusted.  Caution  is  needed  to  avoid  acute  negative 
inotropic effects, but controlling the heart rate is important, as some 
patients develop a form of high-output heart failure. Short-acting 
IV  esmolol  can  be  used  to  decrease  heart  rate  while  monitor-
ing  for  signs  of  heart  failure.  Additional  therapeutic  measures 
include glucocorticoids (e.g., hydrocortisone 300 mg IV bolus, then  
100 mg every 8 h), antibiotics if infection is present, cholestyramine 
to sequester thyroid hormones, cooling, oxygen, and IV fluids.

Ophthalmopathy  requires  no  active  treatment  when  it  is  mild 
or  moderate,  because  there  is  usually  spontaneous  improvement. 
General measures include meticulous control of thyroid hormone 
levels,  cessation  of  smoking,  and  an  explanation  of  the  natural 
history  of  ophthalmopathy.  Discomfort  can  be  relieved  with  arti-
ficial tears (e.g., hypromellose 0.3% or carbomer 0.2% ophthalmic 
gel), paraffin-based eye ointment, and the use of dark glasses with 
side  frames.  Periorbital  edema  may  respond  to  a  more  upright 
sleeping  position  or  a  diuretic.  Corneal  exposure  during  sleep 
can be avoided by using patches or taping the eyelids shut. Minor 
degrees of diplopia improve with prisms fitted to spectacles. Some 
authorities  also  advocate  selenium  100  μg  bid.  Severe  ophthal-
mopathy,  with  optic  nerve  involvement  or  chemosis  resulting  in 
corneal damage, is an emergency requiring joint management with 
an  ophthalmologist.  Pulse  therapy  with  IV  methylprednisolone 
(e.g., 500 mg of methylprednisolone once weekly for 6 weeks, then  
250 mg once weekly for 6 weeks) is preferable to oral glucocorti-
coids, which are used for moderately active disease. When gluco-
corticoids  are  ineffective,  orbital  decompression  can  be  achieved 
by removing bone from any wall of the orbit, thereby allowing dis-
placement of fat and swollen extraocular muscles. The transantral 
route  is  used  most  often  because  it  requires  no  external  incision. 
Proptosis  recedes  an  average  of  5  mm,  but  there  may  be  residual 
or  even  worsened  diplopia.  Once  the  eye  disease  has  stabilized, 
surgery may be indicated for relief of diplopia and correction of the 
appearance. External beam radiotherapy of the orbits has been used 
for  many  years,  but  the  efficacy  of  this  therapy  remains  unclear, 
and  it  is  best  reserved  for  those  with  moderately  active  disease 
who  have  failed  or  are  not  candidates  for  glucocorticoid  therapy.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismTeprotumumab,  a  human  monoclonal  antibody,  received  break-
through designation and was approved by the FDA in 2020. Ran-
domized  clinical  trials  of  patients  with  active  thyroid  eye  disease 
demonstrated  rapid  effects  on  proptosis,  diplopia,  clinical  activity 
score, and quality of life. Responses appear comparable to surgery. 
Teprotumumab  is  administered  at  an  initial  dose  of  10  mg/kg  IV 
and thereafter at 20 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 21 weeks.

Thyroid  dermopathy  does  not  usually  require  treatment,  but 
it  can  cause  cosmetic  problems  or  interfere  with  the  fit  of  shoes. 
Surgical removal is not indicated. If necessary, treatment consists of 
topical,  high-potency  glucocorticoid  ointment  under  an  occlusive 
dressing. Octreotide may be beneficial in some cases.

 ■ OTHER CAUSES OF THYROTOXICOSIS
Destructive thyroiditis (subacute or silent thyroiditis) typically presents 
with a short thyrotoxic phase due to the release of preformed thyroid 
hormones  and  catabolism  of  Tg  (see  “Subacute  Thyroiditis,”  below). 
True hyperthyroidism is absent, as demonstrated by a low radionuclide 
uptake.  Circulating  Tg  levels  are  typically  increased.  Other  causes  of 
thyrotoxicosis with low or absent thyroid radionuclide uptake include 
thyrotoxicosis factitia, iodine excess, and, rarely, ectopic thyroid tissue, 
particularly  teratomas  of  the  ovary  (struma  ovarii)  and  functional 
metastatic follicular carcinoma. Whole-body radionuclide studies can 
demonstrate ectopic thyroid tissue, and thyrotoxicosis factitia can be 
distinguished from destructive thyroiditis by the clinical features and 
low levels of Tg. Amiodarone treatment is associated with thyrotoxico-
sis in up to 10% of patients, particularly in areas of low iodine intake 
(see below).

TSH-secreting  pituitary  adenoma  is  a  rare  cause  of  thyrotoxicosis. 
It  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  an  inappropriately  normal  or 
increased TSH level in a patient with hyperthyroidism, diffuse goiter, 
and  elevated  T4  and  T3  levels  (Chap.  380).  Elevated  levels  of  the  α 
subunit of TSH, released by the TSH-secreting adenoma, support this 
diagnosis,  which  can  be  confirmed  by  demonstrating  the  pituitary 
tumor on MRI or CT scan. A combination of transsphenoidal surgery, 
sella  irradiation,  and  octreotide  may  be  required  to  normalize  TSH, 
because many of these tumors are large and locally invasive at the time 
of diagnosis. Radioiodine or antithyroid drugs can be used to control 
thyrotoxicosis.

Thyrotoxicosis caused by toxic MNG and hyperfunctioning solitary 

nodules is discussed below.

THYROIDITIS
There  are  several  classification  systems  to  describe  the  clinical  syn-
dromes of thyroiditis. One is based on the onset and duration of disease 
(Table 384-3); others are based on the absence or presence of pain.

 ■ ACUTE THYROIDITIS
Acute thyroiditis is rare and due to suppurative infection of the thyroid. 
In children and young adults, the most common cause is the presence 
of  a  piriform  sinus,  a  remnant  of  the  fourth  branchial  pouch  that 
connects the oropharynx with the thyroid. Such sinuses are predomi-
nantly left-sided. A long-standing goiter and degeneration in a thyroid 
malignancy  are  risk  factors  in  the  elderly.  The  patient  presents  with 
thyroid pain, often referred to the throat or ears, and a small, tender 
goiter  that  may  be  asymmetric.  Fever,  dysphagia,  and  erythema  over 
the thyroid are common, as are systemic symptoms of a febrile illness 
and lymphadenopathy.

The  differential  diagnosis  of  thyroid  pain  includes  subacute  or, 
rarely, chronic thyroiditis; hemorrhage into a cyst; malignancy includ-
ing lymphoma; and, rarely, amiodarone-induced thyroiditis or amyloi-
dosis. However, the abrupt presentation and clinical features of acute 
thyroiditis rarely cause confusion. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
(ESR) and white cell count are usually increased, but thyroid function 
is normal. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy shows infiltration by 
polymorphonuclear  leukocytes;  culture  of  the  sample  can  identify 
the organism. Caution is needed in immunocompromised patients as 
fungal,  mycobacterial,  or  Pneumocystis  thyroiditis  can  occur  in  this 
setting.  Antibiotic  treatment  is  guided  initially  by  Gram  stain  and, 
subsequently, by cultures of the FNA biopsy. Surgery may be needed 
to drain an abscess, which can be localized by CT scan or ultrasound. 
Tracheal obstruction, septicemia, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastini-
tis,  and  jugular  venous  thrombosis  may  complicate  acute  thyroiditis 
but are uncommon with prompt use of antibiotics.

 ■ SUBACUTE THYROIDITIS
This  is  also  termed  de  Quervain’s  thyroiditis,  granulomatous  thyroidi-
tis,  or  viral  thyroiditis.  Many  viruses  have  been  implicated,  including 
mumps,  coxsackie,  influenza,  adenoviruses,  and  echoviruses,  but 
attempts to identify the virus in an individual patient are often unsuc-
cessful and do not influence management. Recently, subacute thyroid-
itis associated with the SARS-CoV-2 was described. The diagnosis of 
subacute  thyroiditis  is  often  overlooked  because  the  symptoms  can 
mimic  pharyngitis.  The  peak  incidence  occurs  at  30–50  years,  and 
women are affected three times more frequently than men.

Pathophysiology  The  thyroid  shows  a  characteristic  patchy 
inflammatory  infiltrate  with  disruption  of  the  thyroid  follicles  and 
multinucleated giant cells within some follicles. The follicular changes 
progress  to  granulomas  accompanied  by  fibrosis.  Finally,  the  thyroid 
returns to normal, usually several months after onset. During the ini-
tial phase of follicular destruction, there is release of Tg and thyroid 
hormones, leading to increased circulating T4 and T3 and suppression 
of TSH (Fig. 384-3). During this destructive phase, radioactive iodine 
uptake  is  low  or  undetectable.  After  several  weeks,  the  thyroid  is 
depleted  of  stored  thyroid  hormone  and  a  phase  of  hypothyroidism 
typically occurs, with low unbound T4 (and sometimes T3) and mod-
erately increased TSH levels. Radioactive iodine uptake returns to nor-
mal or is even increased as a result of the rise in TSH. Finally, thyroid 
hormone and TSH levels return to normal as the disease subsides.

Clinical  Manifestations  The  patient  usually  presents  with  a 
painful and enlarged thyroid, sometimes accompanied by fever. There 
may  be  features  of  thyrotoxicosis  or  hypothyroidism,  depending  on 
the phase of the illness. Malaise and symptoms of an upper respiratory 
tract  infection  may  precede  the  thyroid-related  features  by  several 
weeks. In other patients, the onset is acute, severe, and without obvious 
antecedent. The patient typically complains of a sore throat, and exami-
nation  reveals  a  small  goiter  that  is  exquisitely  tender.  Pain  is  often 
referred to the jaw or ear. Complete resolution is the usual outcome, 
but late-onset permanent hypothyroidism occurs in 15% of cases, par-
ticularly in those with coincidental thyroid autoimmunity. A prolonged 
course over many months, with one or more relapses, occurs in a small 
percentage of patients.

Laboratory Evaluation  As  depicted  in  Fig.  384-3,  thyroid  func-
tion  tests  characteristically  evolve  through  three  distinct  phases  over

Clinical Phases

FIGURE  384-3  Clinical  course  of  subacute  thyroiditis.  The  release  of  thyroid 
hormones is initially associated with a thyrotoxic phase and suppressed thyroid-
stimulating  hormone  (TSH).  A  hypothyroid  phase  then  ensues,  with  low  T4  and 
TSH levels that are initially low but gradually increase. During the recovery phase, 
increased TSH levels combined with resolution of thyroid follicular injury lead to 
normalization of thyroid function, often several months after the beginning of the 
illness. ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; UT4, free or unbound T4.

about 6 months: (1) thyrotoxic phase, (2) hypothyroid phase, and (3) 
recovery phase. In the thyrotoxic phase, T4 and T3 levels are increased, 
reflecting their discharge from the damaged thyroid cells, and TSH is 
suppressed. The T4/T3 ratio is greater than in Graves’ disease or thyroid 
autonomy, in which T3 is often disproportionately increased. The diag-
nosis is confirmed by a high ESR and low uptake of radioiodine (<5%) 
or  99mTc  pertechnetate  (as  compared  to  salivary  gland  pertechnetate 
concentration). The white blood cell count may be increased, and thy-
roid antibodies are negative. If the diagnosis is in doubt, FNA biopsy 
may be useful, particularly to distinguish unilateral involvement from 
bleeding into a cyst or neoplasm.

TREATMENT
Subacute Thyroiditis

Relatively large doses of aspirin (e.g., 600 mg every 4–6 h) or non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are sufficient to control 
symptoms  in  many  cases.  If  this  treatment  is  inadequate,  or  if  the 
patient  has  marked  local  or  systemic  symptoms,  glucocorticoids 
should be given. The usual starting dose is 15–40 mg of prednisone, 
depending on severity. The dose is gradually tapered over 6–8 weeks, 
in response to improvement in symptoms and the ESR. If a relapse 
occurs  during  glucocorticoid  withdrawal,  the  dosage  should  be 
increased  and  then  withdrawn  more  gradually.  Thyroid  function 
should be monitored every 2–4 weeks using TSH and free T4 levels. 
Symptoms  of  thyrotoxicosis  improve  spontaneously  but  may  be 
ameliorated  by  β-adrenergic  blockers;  antithyroid  drugs  play  no 
role in treatment of the thyrotoxic phase. LT4 replacement may be 
needed if the hypothyroid phase is prolonged, but doses should be 
low enough (50–100 μg daily) to allow TSH-mediated recovery.

 ■ SILENT THYROIDITIS
Painless thyroiditis, or “silent” thyroiditis, occurs in patients with under-
lying  autoimmune  thyroid  disease  and  has  a  clinical  course  similar 
to  that  of  subacute  thyroiditis.  The  condition  occurs  in  up  to  5%  of 
women  3–6  months  after  pregnancy  and  is  then  termed  postpartum 
thyroiditis. Typically, patients have a brief phase of thyrotoxicosis last-
ing 2–4 weeks, followed by hypothyroidism for 4–12 weeks, and then 
resolution; often, however, only one phase is apparent. The condition 
is associated with the presence of TPO antibodies antepartum, and it is 
three times more common in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus. As 
in subacute thyroiditis, the uptake of 99mTc pertechnetate or radioactive 

iodine is initially suppressed. In addition to the painless goiter, silent 
thyroiditis can be distinguished from subacute thyroiditis by a normal 
ESR and the presence of TPO antibodies. Glucocorticoid treatment is 
not indicated for silent thyroiditis. Severe thyrotoxic symptoms can be 
managed  with  a  brief  course  of  propranolol,  20–40  mg  three  or  four 
times daily. Thyroxine replacement may be needed for the hypothyroid 
phase  but  should  be  withdrawn  after  6–9  months,  as  recovery  is  the 
rule.  Annual  follow-up  thereafter  is  recommended,  because  a  pro-
portion of these individuals develop permanent hypothyroidism. The 
condition may recur in subsequent pregnancies.

 ■ DRUG-INDUCED THYROIDITIS
Patients receiving cytokines, such as IFN-α, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 
and  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  may  develop  painless  thyroiditis. 
IFN-α, which is used to treat chronic hepatitis B or C and hematologic 
and  skin  malignancies,  causes  thyroid  dysfunction  in  up  to  5%  of 
treated patients. It has been associated with painless thyroiditis, hypo-
thyroidism, and Graves’ disease and is most common in women with 
TPO antibodies prior to treatment. For discussion of amiodarone, see 
“Amiodarone Effects on Thyroid Function,” below.

 ■ CHRONIC THYROIDITIS
Focal thyroiditis is present in 20–40% of euthyroid autopsy cases and 
is associated with serologic evidence of autoimmunity, particularly the 
presence  of  TPO  antibodies.  The  most  common  clinically  apparent 
cause of chronic thyroiditis is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune 
disorder  that  often  presents  as  a  firm  or  hard  goiter  of  variable  size 
(Chap. 383). Riedel’s thyroiditis is a rare disorder that typically occurs in 
middle-aged women. It presents with an insidious, painless goiter with 
local  symptoms  due  to  compression  of  the  esophagus,  trachea,  neck 
veins,  or  recurrent  laryngeal  nerves.  Dense  fibrosis  disrupts  normal 
gland architecture and can extend outside the thyroid capsule. Despite 
these extensive histologic changes, thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. 
The  goiter  is  hard,  nontender,  often  asymmetric,  and  fixed,  leading 
to suspicion of a malignancy. Diagnosis requires open biopsy as FNA 
biopsy is usually inadequate. Treatment is directed to surgical relief of 
compressive symptoms. Tamoxifen may also be beneficial. There is an 
association between Riedel’s thyroiditis and IgG4-related disease caus-
ing  idiopathic  fibrosis  at  other  sites  (retroperitoneum,  mediastinum, 
biliary tree, lung, and orbit).

SICK EUTHYROID SYNDROME 
(NONTHYROIDAL ILLNESS)
Any acute, severe illness can cause abnormalities of circulating TSH or 
thyroid hormone levels in the absence of underlying thyroid disease, 
making these measurements potentially misleading. The major cause 
of  these  hormonal  changes  is  the  release  of  cytokines  such  as  IL-6. 
Unless a thyroid disorder is strongly suspected, the routine testing of 
thyroid function should be avoided in acutely ill patients.

The  most  common  hormone  pattern  in  sick  euthyroid  syndrome 
(SES), also called nonthyroidal illness (NTI), is a decrease in total and 
unbound  T3  levels  (low  T3  syndrome)  with  normal  levels  of  T4  and 
TSH. The magnitude of the fall in T3 correlates with the severity of the 
illness. T4 conversion to T3 via peripheral 5′ (outer ring) deiodination is 
impaired, leading to increased reverse T3 (rT3). Since rT3 is metabolized 
by 5′ deiodination, its clearance is also reduced. Thus, decreased clear-
ance rather than increased production is the major basis for increased 
rT3. Also, T4 is alternately metabolized to the hormonally inactive T3 
sulfate. It is generally assumed that this low T3 state is adaptive, because 
it can be induced in normal individuals by fasting. Teleologically, the 
fall in T3 may limit catabolism in starved or ill patients.

Very  sick  patients  may  exhibit  a  dramatic  fall  in  total  T4  and  T3 
levels (low T4 syndrome). With decreased tissue perfusion, muscle and 
liver  expression  of  the  type  3  deiodinase  leads  to  accelerated  T4  and 
T3  metabolism.  This  state  has  a  poor  prognosis.  Another  key  factor 
in the fall in T4 levels is altered binding to thyroxine-binding globulin 
(TBG). The commonly used free T4 assays are subject to artifact when

serum  binding  proteins  are  low  and  underestimate  the  true  free  T4 
level. Fluctuation in TSH levels also creates challenges in the interpre-
tation of thyroid function in sick patients. TSH levels may range from  
<0.1 mIU/L in very ill patients, especially with dopamine or glucocor-
ticoid  therapy,  to  >20  mIU/L  during  the  recovery  phase  of  SES.  The 
exact mechanisms underlying the subnormal TSH seen in 10% of sick 
patients and the increased TSH seen in 5% remain unclear but may be 
mediated by cytokines including IL-12 and IL-18.

Any severe illness can induce changes in thyroid hormone levels, but 
certain disorders exhibit a distinctive pattern of abnormalities. Acute 
liver disease is associated with an initial rise in total (but not unbound) 
T3  and  T4  levels  due  to  TBG  release;  these  levels  become  subnormal 
with  progression  to  liver  failure.  A  transient  increase  in  total  and 
unbound  T4  levels,  usually  with  a  normal  T3  level,  is  seen  in  5–30% 
of acutely ill psychiatric patients. TSH values may be transiently low, 
normal, or high in these patients. In the early stage of HIV infection, T3 
and T4 levels rise, even if there is weight loss. T3 levels fall with progres-
sion to AIDS, but TSH usually remains normal. Renal disease is often 
accompanied  by  low  T3  concentrations,  but  with  normal  rather  than 
increased rT3 levels, due to an unknown factor that increases uptake 
of rT3 into the liver.

The diagnosis of NTI is challenging. Historic information may be 
limited,  and  patients  often  have  multiple  metabolic  derangements. 
Useful features to consider include previous history of thyroid disease 
and thyroid function tests, evaluation of the severity and time course 
of the patient’s acute illness, documentation of medications that may 
affect thyroid function or thyroid hormone levels, and measurements 
of rT3 together with unbound thyroid hormones and TSH. The diag-
nosis of NTI is frequently presumptive, given the clinical context and 
pattern  of  laboratory  values;  only  resolution  of  the  test  results  with 
clinical recovery can clearly establish this disorder. Treatment of NTI 
with thyroid hormone (T4 and/or T3) is controversial, but most author-
ities recommend monitoring the patient’s thyroid function tests during 
recovery,  without  administering  thyroid  hormone,  unless  there  is 
historic or clinical evidence suggestive of hypothyroidism. Sufficiently 
large randomized controlled trials using thyroid hormone are unlikely 
to resolve this therapeutic controversy in the near future, because clin-
ical presentations and outcomes are highly variable.

AMIODARONE EFFECTS ON  
THYROID FUNCTION
Amiodarone  is  a  commonly  used  type  III  antiarrhythmic  agent  
(Chap. 252). It is structurally related to thyroid hormone and contains 
39% iodine by weight. Thus, typical doses of amiodarone (200 mg/d) 
are associated with very high iodine intake, leading to greater than for-
tyfold increases in plasma and urinary iodine levels. Moreover, because 
amiodarone  is  stored  in  adipose  tissue,  high  iodine  levels  persist  for 
>6  months  after  discontinuation  of  the  drug.  Amiodarone  inhibits 
deiodinase  activity,  and  its  metabolites  function  as  weak  antagonists 
of thyroid hormone action. Amiodarone has the following effects on 
thyroid function: (1) acute, transient suppression of thyroid function;  
(2)  inhibition  of  T4  to  T3  conversion  causing  either  euthyroid  hyper-
thyroxinemia  or  increased  dosage  requirement  in  LT4-treated  hypo-
thyroid  patients;  (3)  hypothyroidism  in  patients  susceptible  to  the 
inhibitory effects of a high iodine load; and (4) thyrotoxicosis that may 
be caused by either a Jod-Basedow effect from the iodine load, in the 
setting of MNG or incipient Graves’ disease, or a thyroiditis-like con-
dition due to a toxic effect on thyroid follicular cells.

The  initiation  of  amiodarone  treatment  is  associated  with  a  tran-
sient  decrease  of  T4  levels,  reflecting  the  inhibitory  effect  of  iodine 
on  T4  release.  Soon  thereafter,  most  individuals  escape  from  iodide- 
dependent suppression of the thyroid (Wolff-Chaikoff effect), and the 
inhibitory effects on deiodinase activity and thyroid hormone receptor 
action become predominant. These events lead to the following pattern 
of thyroid function tests: increased T4, decreased T3, increased rT3, and 

a transient TSH increase (up to 20 mIU/L). TSH levels normalize or are 
slightly suppressed within 1–3 months.

The  incidence  of  hypothyroidism  from  amiodarone  varies  geo-
graphically, apparently correlating with iodine intake. Hypothyroidism 
occurs in up to 13% of amiodarone-treated patients in iodine-replete 
countries,  such  as  the  United  States,  but  is  less  common  (<6%  inci-
dence)  in  areas  of  lower  iodine  intake,  such  as  Italy  or  Spain.  The 
pathogenesis  appears  to  involve  an  inability  of  the  thyroid  gland  to 
escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect in autoimmune thyroiditis. Con-
sequently,  amiodarone-associated  hypothyroidism  is  more  common 
in women and individuals with positive TPO antibodies. It is usually 
unnecessary  to  discontinue  amiodarone  for  this  side  effect,  because 
LT4  can  be  used  to  normalize  thyroid  function.  TSH  levels  should 
be  monitored,  because  T4  levels  are  often  increased  for  the  reasons 
described  above.  In  addition,  TSH  levels  need  to  be  monitored  in 
LT4-replaced hypothyroid patients because a dosage increase is often 
required.

The  management  of  amiodarone-induced  thyrotoxicosis  (AIT)  is 
complicated by the fact that there are different causes of thyrotoxicosis 
and because the increased thyroid hormone levels exacerbate underly-
ing  arrhythmias  and  coronary  artery  disease.  Amiodarone  treatment 
causes  thyrotoxicosis  in  10%  of  patients  living  in  areas  of  low  iodine 
intake  and  in  2%  of  patients  in  regions  of  high  iodine  intake.  There 
are  two  major  forms  of  AIT,  although  some  patients  have  features  of 
both. Type 1 AIT is associated with an underlying thyroid abnormality 
(preclinical Graves’ disease or nodular goiter). Thyroid hormone syn-
thesis becomes excessive as a result of increased iodine exposure (Jod- 
Basedow  phenomenon).  Type  2  AIT  occurs  in  individuals  with  no 
intrinsic  thyroid  abnormalities  and  is  the  result  of  drug-induced 
lysosomal  activation  leading  to  destructive  thyroiditis  with  histio-
cyte  accumulation  in  the  thyroid;  the  incidence  rises  as  cumulative 
amiodarone  dosage  increases.  Mild  forms  of  type  2  AIT  can  resolve 
spontaneously or can occasionally lead to hypothyroidism. Color-flow 
Doppler  ultrasonography  shows  increased  vascularity  in  type  1  AIT 
but  decreased  vascularity  in  type  2  AIT.  Thyroid  scintiscans  are  dif-
ficult to interpret in this setting because the high endogenous iodine 
levels  diminish  tracer  uptake.  However,  the  presence  of  normal  or 
rarely increased uptake favors type 1 AIT.

In AIT, the drug should be stopped, if possible, although this is often 
impractical  because  of  the  underlying  cardiac  disorder.  Discontinua-
tion of amiodarone will not have an acute effect because of its storage 
and prolonged half-life. High doses of antithyroid drugs can be used 
in type 1 AIT but are often ineffective. Potassium perchlorate, 200 mg 
every 6 h, has been used to reduce thyroidal iodide content. Perchlorate 
treatment has been associated with agranulocytosis, although the risk 
appears relatively low with short-term use. Glucocorticoids, as admin-
istered for subacute thyroiditis, have modest benefit in type 2 AIT and 
are generally initiated as prednisone 40 mg PO daily. Lithium blocks 
thyroid hormone release and can also provide some benefit. Near-total 
thyroidectomy  rapidly  decreases  thyroid  hormone  levels  and  may  be 
the  most  effective  long-term  solution  if  the  patient  can  undergo  the 
procedure safely.

385 Thyroid Nodular Disease  
and Thyroid Cancer

 ■ GOITER AND THYROID NODULAR DISEASE
Goiter refers to an enlarged thyroid gland. Biosynthetic defects, iodine 
deficiency,  autoimmune  disease,  and  nodular  diseases  can  each  lead 
to goiter, although by different mechanisms. Biosynthetic defects and 
iodine  deficiency  are  associated  with  reduced  efficiency  of  thyroid 
hormone synthesis, leading to increased thyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH),  which  stimulates  thyroid  growth  as  a  compensatory  mecha-
nism  to  overcome  the  block  in  hormone  synthesis.  Graves’  disease 
and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are also associated with goiter. In Graves’  
disease, the goiter results mainly from the TSH-R–mediated effects of 
thyroid-stimulating  immunoglobulins.  The  goitrous  form  of  Hashi-
moto’s thyroiditis occurs because of acquired defects in hormone synthe-
sis, leading to elevated levels of TSH and its consequent growth effects. 
Lymphocytic infiltration and immune system–induced growth factors 
also contribute to thyroid enlargement in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

Thyroid nodular disease is characterized by the disordered growth 
of  thyroid  cells,  which  can  be  either  hyperplastic  or  neoplastic.  A 
patient may have a multinodular goiter (MNG) in which thyroid nod-
ules (generally hyperplastic) replace the majority of the normal thyroid 
parenchyma; this presentation is more common in areas of borderline 
iodine  deficiency.  Or,  the  thyroid  gland  may  be  normal  in  size  and 
contain  discrete  thyroid  nodules.  Because  the  management  of  goiter 
depends on the etiology, the detection of thyroid enlargement on phys-
ical examination should prompt further evaluation to identify its cause.
Nodular  thyroid  disease  is  common,  occurring  in  about  3–7%  of 
adults when assessed by physical examination. Using ultrasound, nod-
ules are present in up to 50% of adults, with the majority being <1 cm 
in diameter. Thyroid nodules may be solitary or multiple, and they may 
be functional or nonfunctional.

 ■ DIFFUSE NONTOXIC (SIMPLE) GOITER
Etiology  and  Pathogenesis  When  diffuse  enlargement  of  the 
thyroid  occurs  in  the  absence  of  nodules  and  hyperthyroidism,  it  is 
referred to as a diffuse nontoxic goiter. This is sometimes called simple 
goiter, because of the absence of nodules, or colloid goiter, because of 
the  presence  of  uniform  follicles  that  are  filled  with  colloid.  World-
wide,  diffuse  goiter  is  most  commonly  caused  by  iodine  deficiency 
and is termed endemic goiter when it affects >5% of the population. In 
nonendemic  regions,  sporadic  goiter  occurs,  and  the  cause  is  usually 
unknown. Thyroid enlargement in teenagers is sometimes referred to 
as juvenile goiter. In general, goiter is more common in women than 
men,  probably  because  of  the  greater  prevalence  of  underlying  auto-
immune  disease  and  the  increased  iodine  demands  associated  with 
pregnancy.

In  iodine-deficient  areas,  thyroid  enlargement  reflects  a  compensa-
tory effort to trap iodide and produce sufficient hormone under con-
ditions in which hormone synthesis is relatively inefficient. Somewhat 
surprisingly, TSH levels are usually normal or only slightly increased, 
suggesting increased sensitivity to TSH or activation of other pathways 
that  lead  to  thyroid  growth.  Iodide  appears  to  have  direct  actions  on 
thyroid vasculature and may indirectly affect growth through vasoactive 
substances  such  as  endothelins  and  nitric  oxide.  Endemic  goiter  may 
also be caused by exposure to environmental goitrogens such as cassava 
root, which contains a thiocyanate; vegetables of the Cruciferae family 
(known as cruciferous vegetables) (e.g., Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and 
cauliflower);  and  milk  from  regions  where  goitrogens  are  present  in 
grass.  Although  relatively  rare,  inherited  defects  in  thyroid  hormone 
synthesis lead to a diffuse nontoxic goiter. Abnormalities at each step 
of  hormone  synthesis,  including  iodide  transport  (sodium/iodide 

symporter  [NIS]),  thyroglobulin  (Tg)  synthesis,  organification  and 
coupling  (thyroid  peroxidase  [TPO]),  and  the  regeneration  of  iodide 
(dehalogenase), have been described.
 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS
If thyroid function is preserved, most goiters are asymptomatic. Exami-
nation of a diffuse goiter reveals a symmetrically enlarged, nontender, 
generally soft gland without palpable nodules. Goiter is defined, some-
what arbitrarily, as a lateral lobe with a volume greater than the thumb 
of the individual being examined. On ultrasound, total thyroid volume 
exceeding  30  mL  is  considered  abnormal.  If  the  thyroid  is  markedly 
enlarged,  it  can  cause  tracheal  or  esophageal  compression.  These 
features are unusual, however, in the absence of nodular disease and 
fibrosis. Substernal goiter may obstruct the thoracic inlet. Pemberton’s 
sign refers to facial and neck congestion due to jugular venous obstruc-
tion when the arms are raised above the head, a maneuver that draws 
the thyroid into the thoracic inlet. Respiratory flow measurements and 
CT or MRI should be used to evaluate substernal goiter in patients with 
obstructive signs or symptoms.

Thyroid  function  tests  should  be  performed  in  all  patients  with 
goiter to exclude thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. It is not unusual, 
particularly in iodine deficiency, to find a low total T4, with normal T3 
and TSH, reflecting enhanced T4 → T3 conversion. A low TSH with a 
normal free T3 and free T4, particularly in older patients, suggests the 
possibility  of  thyroid  autonomy  or  undiagnosed  Graves’  disease,  and 
is termed subclinical thyrotoxicosis. The benefit of treatment (typically 
with  radioiodine)  in  subclinical  thyrotoxicosis,  versus  follow-up  and 
implementing treatment if free T3 or free T4 levels become abnormal, 
is unclear, but treatment is increasingly recommended in the elderly to 
reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation and bone loss. Low urinary iodine 
levels  (<50  μg/L)  support  a  diagnosis  of  iodine  deficiency.  Thyroid 
scanning is not generally necessary but will reveal increased uptake in 
iodine deficiency and most cases of dyshormonogenesis.

TREATMENT
Diffuse Nontoxic (Simple) Goiter

Iodine replacement induces variable regression of goiter in iodine 
deficiency,  depending  on  duration  and  the  degree  of  hyperpla-
sia,  with  accompanying  fibrosis,  and  autonomous  function  that 
may have developed. Surgery is rarely indicated for diffuse goiter. 
Exceptions include documented evidence of tracheal compression 
or  obstruction  of  the  thoracic  inlet,  which  are  more  likely  to  be 
associated with substernal MNGs (see below). Subtotal or near-total 
thyroidectomy for these or cosmetic reasons should be performed 
by an experienced surgeon to minimize complication rates. Surgery 
should be followed by replacement with levothyroxine (LT4).

 ■ NONTOXIC MULTINODULAR GOITER
Etiology and Pathogenesis  Depending on the population stud-
ied,  MNG  or  the  presence  of  nodules  in  a  thyroid  of  normal  size 
occurs in up to 12% of adults. MNG should be distinguished from the 
presence of nodules in a normal-size thyroid gland (see “Approach to 
the Patient with Thyroid Nodules”). MNG is more common in women 
than men and increases in prevalence with age. It is more common in 
iodine-deficient regions but also occurs in regions of iodine sufficiency, 
reflecting multiple genetic, autoimmune, and environmental influences 
on the pathogenesis.

There  is  typically  wide  variation  in  nodule  size.  Histology  reveals 
a spectrum of morphologies ranging from hypercellular, hyperplastic 
regions  to  cystic  areas  filled  with  colloid.  Fibrosis  is  often  extensive, 
and  areas  of  hemorrhage  or  lymphocytic  infiltration  may  be  seen. 
Using molecular techniques, most nodules within an MNG are poly-
clonal in origin, suggesting a hyperplastic response to locally produced 
growth factors and cytokines. TSH, which is usually not elevated, may 
play a permissive or contributory role. Monoclonal neoplastic lesions 
may  also  occur,  reflecting  mutations  in  genes  that  confer  a  selective 
growth advantage to the progenitor cell.

FIGURE 385-1  American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS). TI-RADS is a five-tiered system categorizing the sonographic 
appearance of thyroid nodules based on increased risk for malignancy. For each level (TR1–5), there are recommendations for both fine-needle aspiration (FNA) minimum 
size cutoffs and follow-up. (Reproduced with permission from FN Tessler et al: ACR Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS): White Paper of the ACR TI-RADS 
Committee. J Am Coll Radiol 14:587, 2017.)

Clinical  Manifestations  Most  patients  with  nontoxic  MNG  are 
asymptomatic  and  euthyroid.  MNG  typically  develops  over  many 
years and is detected on routine physical examination, when an indi-
vidual notices an enlargement in the neck, or as an incidental finding 
on  imaging.  If  the  goiter  is  large  enough,  it  can  ultimately  lead  to 
compressive  symptoms  including  difficulty  swallowing,  respiratory 
distress  (tracheal  compression),  or  plethora  (venous  congestion),  but 
these  symptoms  are  uncommon.  Symptomatic  MNGs  are  usually 
extraordinarily  large  and/or  develop  fibrotic  areas  that  cause  com-
pression.  Sudden  pain  in  an  MNG  is  usually  caused  by  hemorrhage 
into a nodule. Hoarseness, reflecting laryngeal nerve involvement may 
suggest malignancy but more commonly is due to others causes such 
as gastroesophageal reflux.

Diagnosis  On  examination,  thyroid  architecture  is  distorted,  and 
multiple  nodules  of  varying  size  can  be  appreciated.  Because  many 
nodules are deeply embedded in thyroid tissue or reside in posterior 
or substernal locations, it is not possible to palpate all nodules. Pem-
berton’s sign, characterized by facial suffusion when the patient’s arms 
are  elevated  above  the  head,  suggests  that  the  goiter  has  increased 
pressure  in  the  thoracic  inlet.  A  TSH  level  should  be  measured  to 
exclude subclinical hyper- or hypothyroidism, but thyroid function is 
usually normal. Tracheal deviation is common, but compression must 
usually exceed 70% of the tracheal diameter before there is significant 
airway compromise. Pulmonary function testing can be used to assess 
the  functional  effects  of  compression,  which  characteristically  causes 
inspiratory stridor. CT or MRI can be used to evaluate the anatomy of 

the goiter and the extent of substernal extension or tracheal narrowing. 
A  barium  swallow  may  reveal  the  extent  of  esophageal  compression. 
The risk of malignancy in MNG is similar to that in solitary nodules. 
Ultrasonography  should  be  used  to  identify  which  nodules  should 
be  biopsied  based  on  a  combination  of  size  and  sonographic  pattern  
(Fig.  385-1)  (Chap.  382).  For  nodules  with  more  suspicious  sono-
graphic patterns (e.g., hypoechoic solid nodules with infiltrative bor-
ders), biopsy is recommended at a lower size cutoff than those with less 
suspicious imaging features (Figs. 385-1 and 385-2).

TREATMENT
Nontoxic Multinodular Goiter

Most nontoxic MNGs can be managed conservatively. T4 suppres-
sion  is  rarely  effective  for  reducing  goiter  size  and  introduces  the 
risk  of  subclinical  or  overt  thyrotoxicosis,  particularly  if  there  is 
underlying autonomy or if it develops during treatment. Contrast 
agents  and  other  iodine-containing  substances  should  be  avoided 
because of the risk of inducing the Jod-Basedow effect, characterized 
by enhanced thyroid hormone production by autonomous nodules. 
Radioiodine has been used when surgery is contraindicated in areas 
where large nodular goiters are more prevalent (e.g., some areas of 
Europe and Brazil) because it can decrease MNG volume and may 
selectively  ablate  regions  of  autonomy.  Dosage  of  131I  depends  on 
the  size  of  the  goiter  and  radioiodine  uptake  but  is  usually  about   
3.7  MBq  (0.1  mCi)  per  gram  of  tissue,  corrected  for  uptake

(typical dose 370–1070 MBq [10–29 mCi]). Repeat treatment may 
be  needed,  and  effectiveness  may  be  increased  by  concurrent 
administration  of  low-dose  recombinant  TSH  (0.1  mg  IM).  It 
is  possible  to  achieve  a  40–50%  reduction  in  goiter  size  in  most 
patients. Earlier concerns about radiation-induced thyroid swelling 
and tracheal compression have diminished, as studies have shown 
this  complication  to  be  rare.  When  acute  compression  occurs, 
glucocorticoid  treatment  or  surgery  may  be  needed.  Radiation- 
induced  hypothyroidism  is  less  common  than  after  treatment  for 
Graves’  disease.  However,  posttreatment  autoimmune  thyrotoxi-
cosis may occur in up to 5% of patients treated for nontoxic MNG. 
Surgery remains highly effective but is not without risk, particularly 
in older patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease.

activating TSH-R or GSα mutations (see below), are not usually found 
in the autonomous regions of toxic MNG goiter.

In  addition  to  features  of  goiter,  the  clinical  presentation  of  toxic 
MNG includes subclinical or mild overt hyperthyroidism. The patient 
is usually elderly and may present with atrial fibrillation or palpitations, 
tachycardia,  nervousness,  tremor,  or  weight  loss.  Recent  exposure  to 
iodine, from contrast dyes or other sources, may precipitate or exac-
erbate thyrotoxicosis. The TSH level is low. The uncombined T4 level 
may be normal or minimally increased; T3 is often elevated to a greater 
degree than T4. Thyroid scan shows heterogeneous uptake with multi-
ple regions of increased and decreased uptake; 24-h uptake of radioio-
dine may not be increased but is usually in the upper normal range.

Prior  to  definitive  treatment  of  the  hyperthyroidism,  ultrasound 
imaging should be performed to assess the presence of discrete nodules 
corresponding to areas of decreased uptake (“cold” nodules). If present, 
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may be indicated based on sonographic 
patterns  and  size  cutoffs  (see  “Approach  to  the  Patient  with  Thyroid 
Nodules”).  The  cytology  results,  if  indeterminate  or  suspicious,  may 
direct the therapy to surgery.

TREATMENT
Toxic Multinodular Goiter

Antithyroid drugs normalize thyroid function and are particularly 
useful in the elderly or ill patients with limited life span. In contrast 
to  Graves’  disease,  spontaneous  remission  does  not  occur  and  so 
treatment  is  long  term.  Radioiodine  is  generally  the  treatment  of 
choice;  it  treats  areas  of  autonomy  as  well  as  decreasing  the  mass 
of the goiter by ablating the functioning nodules. Sometimes, how-
ever, a degree of autonomy may persist, presumably because mul-
tiple autonomous regions may emerge after others are treated, and 
further radioiodine treatment may be necessary. Surgery provides 
definitive treatment of underlying thyrotoxicosis as well as goiter. 
Patients  should  be  rendered  euthyroid  using  an  antithyroid  drug 
before operation.

 ■ HYPERFUNCTIONING SOLITARY NODULE
A solitary, autonomously functioning thyroid nodule is referred to as 
toxic adenoma. The pathogenesis of this disorder has been unraveled 
by  demonstrating  the  functional  effects  of  mutations  that  stimulate 
the TSH-R signaling pathway. Most patients with solitary hyperfunc-
tioning  nodules  have  acquired  somatic,  activating  mutations  in  the 
TSH-R (Fig. 385-3). These mutations, located primarily in the receptor 
transmembrane domain, induce constitutive receptor coupling to GSα, 
increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and leading 
to enhanced thyroid follicular cell proliferation and function. Less com-
monly, somatic mutations are identified in GSα. These mutations, which 
are similar to those seen in McCune-Albright syndrome (Chap. 412) or 
in a subset of somatotrope adenomas (Chap. 380), impair guanosine 
triphosphate  (GTP)  hydrolysis,  causing  constitutive  activation  of  the 
cyclic AMP signaling pathway. In most series, activating mutations in 
either the TSH-R or the GSα subunit genes are identified in >90% of 
patients with solitary hyperfunctioning nodules.

Thyrotoxicosis is usually mild and is generally only detected when a 
nodule is >3 cm. The disorder is suggested by a subnormal TSH level; 
the presence of the thyroid nodule, often large enough to be palpable; 
and  the  absence  of  clinical  features  suggestive  of  Graves’  disease  or 
other  causes  of  thyrotoxicosis.  A  thyroid  scan  provides  a  definitive 
diagnostic  test,  demonstrating  focal  uptake  in  the  hyperfunctioning 
nodule and diminished uptake in the remainder of the gland, as activity 
of the normal thyroid is suppressed.

 ■ TOXIC MULTINODULAR GOITER
The pathogenesis of toxic MNG appears to be similar to that of non-
toxic MNG; the major difference is the presence of functional auton-
omy in toxic MNG. The molecular basis for autonomy in toxic MNG 
remains  unknown.  As  in  nontoxic  goiters,  many  nodules  are  poly-
clonal, whereas others are monoclonal and vary in their clonal origins. 
Genetic abnormalities known to confer functional autonomy, such as 

TREATMENT
Hyperfunctioning Solitary Nodule

Radioiodine  ablation  is  usually  the  treatment  of  choice.  Because 
normal  thyroid  function  is  suppressed,  131I  is  concentrated  in  the 
hyperfunctioning  nodule  with  minimal  uptake  and  damage  to

normal thyroid tissue. Relatively large radioiodine doses (e.g., 370–
1110 MBq [10–29.9 mCi] 131I) have been shown to correct thyrotox-
icosis in ~75% of patients within 3 months. Hypothyroidism occurs 
in <10% of those patients over the next 5 years. Surgical resection is 
also effective and is usually limited to lobectomy, thereby preserv-
ing  thyroid  function  and  minimizing  risk  of  hypoparathyroidism 
or damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Medical therapy using 
antithyroid drugs and beta blockers can normalize thyroid function 
but is not an optimal long-term treatment. Using ultrasound guid-
ance, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation has been used success-
fully in some centers to ablate hyperfunctioning nodules, and this 
technique has also been used to reduce the size of nonfunctioning 
thyroid nodules.

BENIGN LESIONS
The various types of benign thyroid nodules are listed in Table 385-1. 
Benign nodules may be hyperplastic and reflect a combination of both 
macro-  and  microfollicular  architecture  or  they  may  be  neoplastic, 
encapsulated  adenomas  that  generally  have  a  more  monotonous 
microfollicular pattern. If the adenoma is composed of oncocytic fol-
licular cells arranged in a follicular pattern, this is termed Hürthle cell 
adenoma. Hyperplastic nodules generally appear as mixed cystic/solid 
or  spongiform  lesions  on  ultrasound.  The  definition  of  spongiform 
requires  the  presence  of  microcystic  areas  comprising  >50%  of  the 
nodule  volume,  with  the  concept  that  this  microcystic  sonographic 
pattern recapitulates the histology of macrofollicles containing colloid 
(Fig. 385-2B). However, the majority of solid nodules (whether hypo-, 
iso-,  or  hyperechoic)  are  also  benign.  FNA,  usually  performed  with 
ultrasound guidance, is the diagnostic procedure of choice to evaluate 
thyroid nodules (see the “Approach to the Patient with Thyroid Nod-
ules” section). Pure thyroid cysts, <1% of all thyroid growths, consist 
of  colloid  and  are  benign  as  well.  Cysts  frequently  recur,  even  after 
repeated aspiration, and may require surgical excision if they are large. 
Ethanol  ablation  to  sclerose  the  cyst  has  been  used  successfully  for 
patients who are symptomatic.

TSH suppression with LT4 therapy does not decrease thyroid nodule 
size in iodine-sufficient populations. However, if there is relative iodine

deficiency,  both  iodine  and  LT4  therapy  have  been  demonstrated  to 
decrease  nodule  volume.  If  LT4  is  administered  in  this  situation,  the 
TSH should be maintained at or just below the lower limit of normal, 
but not frankly suppressed. If the nodule has not decreased in size after 
6–12  months  of  therapy,  treatment  should  be  discontinued  because 
little benefit is likely to accrue from long-term treatment; the risk of 
iatrogenic subclinical thyrotoxicosis should also be considered.

THYROID CANCER
Thyroid  carcinoma  is  the  most  common  malignancy  of  the  endocrine 
system.  Malignant  tumors  derived  from  the  follicular  epithelium  are 
classified  according  to  histologic  features.  Differentiated  tumors,  such 
as papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) or follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), are 
often curable, and the prognosis is good for patients identified with early- 
stage disease. In contrast, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is aggressive, 
responds poorly to treatment, and is associated with a bleak prognosis.

Over the past 30 years, the incidence of thyroid cancer has increased 
from  4.9  to  >15  cases  per  100,000  individuals  in  the  United  States. 
However,  disease-specific  mortality  has  only  minimally  increased. 
The  increased  incidence  is  predominantly  attributable  to  small  T1 
papillary cancer tumors (<2 cm) and has led experts to consider that 
thyroid  cancer  is  being  overdiagnosed,  suggesting  that  cancers  are 
being  detected  that  would  otherwise  be  unlikely  to  harm  a  patient. 
The concept of cancer overdiagnosis is predicated upon the presence 
of a disease reservoir (the autopsy prevalence of PTC is ~25%), activ-
ities  leading  to  disease  detection  (increased  diagnostic  imaging  with 
incidental  detection  of  nodules),  and  a  mismatch  in  the  directional 
rate between diagnosis and mortality (thyroid cancer disease-specific 
mortality not changed in 40 years). Similar trends have been observed 
worldwide,  especially  in  countries  with  a  higher  proportion  of  pri-
vately  financed  health  care,  leading  to  increased  resource  utilization 
including imaging. The 20-year disease-specific mortality for low-risk

thyroid  cancer  is  1%.  Fortunately,  epidemiologic  data  in  the  United 
States document a decrease in new thyroid cancer diagnoses (62,450 
cases in 2015 and 52,070 cases in 2019), and this trend correlates with 
the  implementation  of  evidence-based  guidelines  that  recommend 
higher size thresholds for nodule FNA.

Current  trends  in  thyroid  cancer  care  focus  on  (1)  avoiding  over-
diagnosis  by  limiting  FNA  by  sonographic  risk  stratification  with  
size cutoffs; (2) limiting surgery, radioiodine, and subsequent surveil-
lance for low-risk tumors; and (3) identifying patients at higher recur-
rence risk for more aggressive treatment and monitoring. Prognosis is 
worse in older persons (>65 years). Thyroid cancer is twice as common 
in women as men, but male gender is associated with a worse progno-
sis.  Additional  important  risk  factors  include  a  history  of  childhood 
(before age 18) head or neck irradiation, evidence for local tumor fixa-
tion or gross metastatic involvement of lymph nodes, and the presence 
of distant metastases (Table 385-2).

Several unique features of thyroid cancer facilitate its management: 
(1) thyroid nodules are amenable to biopsy by FNA; (2) iodine radio-
isotopes  can  be  used  to  diagnose  (123I  and  131I)  and  potentially  treat 
(131I) differentiated thyroid cancer, reflecting the unique uptake of this 
anion by the thyroid gland; and (3) serum markers allow the detection 
of residual or recurrent disease, including the use of Tg levels for PTC 
and FTC and calcitonin for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).
 ■ CLASSIFICATION
Thyroid neoplasms can arise in each of the cell types that populate the 
gland,  including  thyroid  follicular  cells,  calcitonin-producing  C  cells, 
lymphocytes, and stromal and vascular elements, as well as metastases 
from other sites (Table 385-1). The American Joint Committee on Can-
cer (AJCC) staging system using the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) 
classification is most commonly used (Table 385-3).
 ■ PATHOGENESIS AND GENETIC BASIS
Radiation  Early  studies  of  the  pathogenesis  of  thyroid  cancer 
focused  on  the  role  of  external  radiation,  which  predisposes  to 
chromosomal  breaks,  leading  to  genetic  rearrangements  and  loss  of 
tumor-suppressor genes. External radiation of the mediastinum, face, 
head, and neck region was administered in the past to treat an array of 
conditions, including acne and enlargement of the thymus, tonsils, and 
adenoids. Radiation exposure increases the risk of benign and malig-
nant thyroid nodules, is associated with multicentric cancers, and shifts 
the incidence of thyroid cancer to an earlier age group. Radiation from 
nuclear fallout also increases the risk of thyroid cancer. Children seem 
more predisposed to the effects of radiation than adults.

TSH  and  Growth  Factors  Many  differentiated  thyroid  cancers 
express  TSH  receptors  and,  therefore,  remain  responsive  to  TSH. 
Higher  serum  TSH  levels,  even  within  normal  range,  are  associated 
with  increased  thyroid  cancer  risk  in  patients  with  thyroid  nodules. 
These observations provide the rationale for T4 suppression of TSH in 
patients with thyroid cancer. Residual expression of TSH receptors also 
allows TSH-stimulated uptake of 131I therapy (see below).

Oncogenes  and  Tumor-Suppressor  Genes  Thyroid  cancers  are 
monoclonal  in  origin,  consistent  with  the  idea  that  they  originate  as  a

consequence  of  mutations  that  confer  a  growth  advantage  to  a  single 
cell. In addition to increased rates of proliferation, some thyroid cancers 
exhibit impaired apoptosis and features that enhance invasion, angiogen-
esis, and metastasis. Thyroid neoplasms have been analyzed for a variety 
of genetic alterations, but without clear evidence of an ordered acquisition 
of somatic mutations as they progress from the benign to the malignant 
state. On the other hand, certain mutations, such as RET/PTC and PAX-
8-PPARγ1 rearrangements, are relatively specific for thyroid neoplasia.

As described above, activating mutations of the TSH-R and the GSα 
subunit are associated with autonomously functioning nodules. Although 
these mutations induce thyroid cell growth, this type of nodule is almost 
always benign, likely because they drive differentiation pathways.

Activation  of  the  RET-RAS-BRAF  signaling  pathway  is  seen  in  up 
to 70% of PTCs, although the types of mutations are heterogeneous. A 
variety  of  rearrangements  involving  the  RET  gene  on  chromosome  10 
bring this receptor tyrosine kinase under the control of other promot-
ers,  leading  to  receptor  overexpression.  RET  rearrangements  occur  in 
20–40%  of  PTCs  in  different  series  and  were  observed  with  increased

frequency in tumors developing after the Chernobyl radiation accident. 
Rearrangements in PTC have also occurred for another tyrosine kinase 
gene, TRK1, which is located on chromosome 1. To date, the identifica-
tion of PTC with RET or  TRK1 rearrangements has not proven useful 
for predicting prognosis or treatment responses. BRAF V600E mutations 
appear to be the most common genetic alteration in PTC. These muta-
tions  activate  the  kinase,  which  stimulates  the  mitogen-activated  pro-
tein kinase (MAPK) cascade. RAS mutations, which also stimulate the 
MAPK cascade, are found in ~20–30% of thyroid neoplasms (NRAS > 
HRAS > KRAS), including both PTC follicular variant and FTC. Of note, 
simultaneous RET, BRAF, and RAS mutations rarely occur in the same 
tumor,  suggesting  that  activation  of  the  MAPK  cascade  is  critical  for 
tumor development, independent of the step that initiates the cascade.

RAS mutations also occur in FTCs. In addition, a rearrangement of 
the thyroid developmental transcription factor PAX8 with the nuclear 
receptor PPARγ is identified in a significant fraction of FTCs. Overall, 
~70% of follicular cancers have mutations or genetic rearrangements. 
Loss of heterozygosity of 3p or 11q, consistent with deletions of tumor-
suppressor genes, is also common in FTCs.

Most  of  the  mutations  seen  in  differentiated  thyroid  cancers  have 
also been detected in ATCs. TERT promoter mutations occur in <10% 
of differentiated PTCs but are more common in ATC. BRAF mutations 
are seen in up to 50% of ATCs. Mutations in CTNNB1, which encodes 
β-catenin, occur in about two-thirds of ATCs, but not in PTC or FTC. 
Mutations of the tumor-suppressor P53 also play an important role in the 
development of ATC. Because P53 plays a role in cell-cycle surveillance, 
DNA repair, and apoptosis, its loss may contribute to the rapid acquisi-
tion of genetic instability as well as poor treatment responses (Chap. 72).
The  role  of  molecular  diagnostics  in  the  clinical  management  of 
thyroid cancer is under investigation. In principle, analyses of specific 
mutations might aid in classification, prognosis, or choice of treatment. 
Although  BRAF  V600E  mutations  are  associated  with  loss  of  iodine 
uptake by tumor cells. As discussed below, trials of multikinase path-
way  inhibitors  are  ongoing  as  a  means  to  restore  iodine  uptake  and 
enhance sensitivity to radioiodine treatment. Higher recurrence rates 
have been variably reported in patients with BRAF-positive PTC, but 
the impact on survival rates is unclear.

MTC, when associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 
2, harbors an inherited mutation of the RET gene. Unlike the rearrange-
ments of RET seen in PTC, the mutations in MEN 2 are point mutations 
that  induce  constitutive  activity  of  the  tyrosine  kinase  (Chap.  388). 
MTC  is  preceded  by  hyperplasia  of  the  C  cells,  raising  the  likelihood 
that as-yet-unidentified “second hits” lead to cellular transformation. A 
subset of sporadic MTC contains somatic mutations that activate RET.
 ■ WELL-DIFFERENTIATED THYROID CANCER
Papillary  PTC is the most common type of thyroid cancer, account-
ing  for  80–85%  of  well-differentiated  thyroid  malignancies.  Micro-
scopic PTC is present in up to 25% of thyroid glands at autopsy, but 
most of these lesions are very small (several millimeters) and are not 
clinically  significant.  Characteristic  cytologic  features  of  PTC  help 
make the diagnosis by FNA or after surgical resection; these include, 
large, clear nuclei with powdery chromatin (described as an “orphan 
Annie eye” appearance) with nuclear grooves and prominent nucleoli. 
The histologic finding of these cells arranged in either papillary struc-
tures or follicles distinguishes the classic and follicular variants of PTC, 
respectively. There are several subtypes of papillary thyroid cancer. The 
more differentiated classic and follicular variants are likely to have an 
indolent course in the absence of angioinvasion or metastatic adenop-
athy. The aggressive variants (tall cell, columnar cell, hobnail, poorly 
differentiated)  require  more  intensive  therapy  and  closer  follow-up. 
Recently, a subtype previously known as the encapsulated PTC follicu-
lar variant, without capsular or angioinvasion, is no longer considered 
malignant and has been renamed noninvasive follicular thyroid neo-
plasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP).

PTC may be multifocal and invade locally within the thyroid gland 
as  well  as  through  the  thyroid  capsule  and  into  adjacent  structures 
in  the  neck.  It  has  a  propensity  to  spread  via  the  lymphatic  system 
but can metastasize hematogenously as well, particularly to bone and 
lung. Because of the relatively slow growth of the tumor, a significant

burden  of  pulmonary  metastases  may  accumulate,  sometimes  with 
remarkably few symptoms. The prognostic implication of lymph node 
spread depends on the volume of metastatic disease. Micrometastases, 
defined as <2 mm of cancer in a lymph node, do not affect prognosis. 
However, gross metastatic involvement of multiple 2- to 3-cm lymph 
nodes  indicates  a  25–30%  chance  of  recurrence  and  may  increase 
mortality  in  older  patients.  The  staging  of  PTC  by  the  TNM  system 
is outlined in Table 385-3. Most papillary cancers are identified in the 
early stages (>95% stages I or II) and have an excellent prognosis, with 
survival curves similar to expected survival (Fig. 385-4). Mortality is 
markedly  increased  in  stage  IV  disease,  especially  in  the  presence  of 
distant metastases (stage IVB), but this group comprises only about 1% 
of patients. The treatment of PTC is described below.

Follicular  The incidence of FTC varies widely in different parts of 
the  world;  it  is  more  common  in  iodine-deficient  regions.  Currently, 
FTC accounts for only about 5% of all thyroid cancers diagnosed in the 
United States. FTC is difficult to diagnose by FNA because the distinc-
tion between benign and malignant follicular neoplasms requires histol-
ogy because the nuclear features of follicular adenomas and carcinomas 
do not differ. Rather, follicular carcinoma is diagnosed by the presence 
of  capsular  and/or  vascular  invasion.  Follicular  carcinomas  with  only 
capsular  invasion  have  a  very  low  risk  of  metastasis,  and  lobectomy 
alone suffices. Angioinvasive FTC is more aggressive and may metasta-
size to bone, lung, and the central nervous system. Mortality rates asso-
ciated with angioinvasive FTC are less favorable than for PTC, in part 
because  a  larger  proportion  of  patients  present  with  stage  IV  disease. 
Poor prognostic features include distant metastases, age >55 years, pri-
mary tumor size >4 cm, and the presence of marked vascular invasion.

TREATMENT
Surgery for Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer

All well-differentiated thyroid cancers >1 cm (T1b or larger) should 
be surgically excised, although active surveillance is an option for 
small intrathyroidal micropapillary thyroid cancers (T1a) without 
metastases.  In  addition  to  removing  the  primary  lesion,  surgery 
allows  accurate  histologic  diagnosis  and  staging.  Because  there  is 
no  compelling  evidence  that  bilateral  thyroid  surgery  improves 
survival,  the  initial  surgical  procedure  may  be  either  a  unilateral 
(lobectomy)  or  bilateral  (near-total  thyroidectomy)  procedure  for 
patients  with  intrathyroidal  cancers  >1  cm  and  <4  cm  (T1b  and 
T2  tumors)  in  the  absence  of  metastatic  disease  and  after  a  care-
ful  sonographic  evaluation  for  metastatic  cervical  adenopathy.  For 
patients at high risk for recurrence, bilateral surgery allows adminis-
tration of radioiodine for remnant ablation and potential treatment

of iodine-avid metastases, if indicated, as well as for monitoring of 
serum  Tg  levels.  Therefore,  near-total  thyroidectomy  is  appropri-
ate  for  tumors  >4  cm  or  in  the  presence  of  metastases  or  clinical 
evidence of extrathyroidal invasion. In addition, for patients found 
to  have  a  high-risk  tumor  after  lobectomy  based  upon  aggressive 
pathology  features  (e.g.,  vascular  invasion  or  a  less  differentiated 
subtype), completion surgery should be performed. Surgical compli-
cation rates are acceptably low if the surgeon is highly experienced 
in  the  procedure.  Preoperative  sonography  should  be  performed 
in all patients to assess the central and lateral cervical lymph node 
compartments for suspicious adenopathy, which if present, should 
undergo FNA and be removed, as indicated, at surgery. 
TSH SUPPRESSION THERAPY
Because  most  tumors  are  still  TSH-responsive,  LT4  suppression  of 
TSH is a mainstay of thyroid cancer treatment. Although TSH sup-
pression clearly provides therapeutic benefit, there are no prospective 
studies that define the optimal level of TSH suppression. The degree of 
TSH suppression should be individualized based on a patient’s risk of 
recurrence. It should be adjusted over time as surveillance blood tests 
and imaging confirm absence of disease or, alternatively, indicate pos-
sible residual/recurrent cancer. For patients at low risk of recurrence, 
TSH should be maintained in the lower normal limit (0.5–2.0 mIU/L). 
For  patients  either  at  intermediate  or  high  risk  of  recurrence,  TSH 
levels should be kept to 0.1–0.5 mIU/L and <0.1 mIU/L, respectively, 
if there are no strong contraindications to mild thyrotoxicosis. TSH 
should be <0.1 mIU/L for those with known metastatic disease. 
RADIOIODINE TREATMENT
After  near-total  thyroidectomy,  <1  g  of  thyroid  tissue  remains  in 
the thyroid bed. Postsurgical radioablation of the remnant thyroid 
eliminates residual normal thyroid, facilitating the use of Tg deter-
minations.  In  addition,  well-differentiated  thyroid  cancer  often 
incorporates  radioiodine,  although  less  efficiently  than  normal 
thyroid follicular cells. Radioiodine uptake is determined primar-
ily  by  expression  of  the  NIS  and  is  stimulated  by  TSH,  requiring 
expression  of  the  TSH-R.  The  retention  time  for  radioactivity  is 
influenced by the extent to which the tumor retains differentiated 
functions such as iodide trapping and organification. Consequently, 
for patients at higher risk of recurrence and for those with known 
distant metastatic disease, 131I therapy may provide an adjuvant role 
and potentially treat residual tumor cells. 
Indications  Not  all  patients  benefit  from  radioiodine  therapy. 
Neither recurrence nor survival rates are improved in stage I patients 
with  T1  tumors  (≤2  cm)  confined  to  the  thyroid.  No  benefit  has 
been  demonstrated  for  larger  (>2  cm  but  <4  cm)  low-risk  tumors. 
However,  in  higher  risk  patients  (larger  tumors,  more  aggressive 
variants of papillary cancer, tumor vascular invasion, extrathyroidal 
invasion, presence of large-volume lymph node metastases), radioio-
dine reduces recurrence and may increase survival for older patients. 
131I Thyroid Ablation and Treatment  As noted above, the decision 
to use 131I for thyroid ablation should be coordinated with the sur-
gical approach, because radioablation is much more effective when 
there  is  minimal  remaining  normal  thyroid  tissue.  Radioiodine  is 
administered  after  iodine  depletion  (patient  follows  a  low-iodine 
diet  for  1–2  weeks)  and  in  the  presence  of  elevated  serum  TSH 
levels  to  stimulate  uptake  of  the  isotope  into  both  the  remnant 
and  potentially  any  residual  tumor.  To  achieve  high  serum  TSH 
levels, there are two approaches. A patient may be withdrawn from 
thyroid  hormone  so  that  endogenous  TSH  is  secreted  and,  ide-
ally, the serum TSH level is >25 mIU/L at the time of  131I therapy.  
A typical strategy is to treat the patient for several weeks postopera-
tively with liothyronine (25 μg qd or bid), followed by thyroid hor-
mone  withdrawal  for  2  weeks.  Alternatively,  recombinant  human 
TSH  (rhTSH)  is  administered  as  two  daily  consecutive  injections   
(0.9 mg) with administration of 131I 24 h after the second injection. 
The patient can continue to take LT4 and remains euthyroid. Both 
approaches have equal success in achieving remnant ablation.

A pretreatment scanning dose of 131I (usually 111 MBq [3 mCi]) 
or  123I  (74  MBq  [2  mCi])  can  reveal  the  amount  of  residual 

tissue and provides guidance about the dose needed to accomplish 
ablation.  However,  because  of  concerns  about  radioactive  “stun-
ning” that impairs subsequent treatment, there is a trend to avoid  
pretreatment scanning with 131I and use either 123I or proceed directly 
to ablation, unless there is suspicion that the amount of residual tis-
sue will alter therapy or that there is distant metastatic disease. In 
the United States, outpatient doses of up to 6475 MBq (175 mCi) 
can  be  given  at  most  centers.  The  administered  dose  depends  on 
the indication for therapy, with lower doses of 1100 MBq (30 mCi) 
given  for  remnant  ablation  but  higher  doses  of  up  to  5500  MBq   
(150 mCi) reserved for use as adjuvant therapy when residual dis-
ease is suspected or present. Whole-body scanning (WBS) follow-
ing radioiodine treatment is used to confirm the  131I uptake in the 
remnant and to identify possible metastatic disease. 
Surveillance Testing  Serum thyroglobulin is a sensitive marker of 
residual/recurrent thyroid cancer after ablation of the residual post-
surgical thyroid tissue. Current Tg assays have functional sensitivi-
ties as low as 0.1 ng/mL, as opposed to older assays with functional 
sensitivities  of  1–2  ng/mL,  reducing  the  number  of  patients  with 
truly undetectable serum Tg levels. Because the vast majority of PTC 
recurrences are in cervical lymph nodes, a neck ultrasound should 
be performed about 6 months after thyroid ablation; ultrasound has 
been shown to be more sensitive than WBS in this scenario.

In  low-risk  patients  who  have  no  clinical  evidence  of  residual 
disease  after  ablation,  negative  cervical  sonography,  and  a  basal  Tg 
<0.2 ng/mL on LT4, the risk of structural recurrence is <3% at 5 years, 
and  the  frequency  of  follow-up  testing  can  be  decreased  to  annual 
TSH and Tg testing, with only periodic ultrasound examination.

The use of WBS is reserved for patients with known iodine-avid 
metastases  or  those  with  elevated  serum  thyroglobulin  levels  and 
negative  imaging  with  ultrasound,  chest  CT,  neck  cross-sectional 
imaging,  and  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  CT  who  may 
require additional 131I therapy.

In  addition  to  radioiodine,  external  beam  radiotherapy  is  also 
used  to  treat  gross  residual  neck  disease  or  specific  metastatic 
lesions, particularly when they cause bone pain or threaten neuro-
logic injury (e.g., vertebral metastases). 
New  Potential  Therapies  Kinase  inhibitors  target  pathways 
known  to  be  active  in  thyroid  cancer,  including  the  RAS,  BRAF, 
RET,  EGFR,  VEGFR,  and  angiogenesis  pathways.  Treatment  has 
been shown to stabilize progressive metastatic disease that is refrac-
tory  to  radioiodine  therapy,  although  only  one  study  has  demon-
strated improved survival. Given the significant associated toxicities 
and  the  need  for  ongoing  therapy,  patient  selection  is  critical  to 
limit systemic therapy to those with significant morbidity risk. The 
American  Thyroid  Association  guidelines  recommend  active  sur-
veillance for asymptomatic patients with metastatic tumors between 
1  and  2  cm  and  then  intervention  as  the  rate  of  tumor  growth 
increases.  In  addition,  based  on  genetic  analyses  of  metastases, 
mutation-selective kinase inhibitors are now being used. Ongoing 
trials are also exploring whether differentiation protocols, targeting 
the MAPK pathway, might enhance radioiodine uptake and efficacy.

 ■ ANAPLASTIC AND OTHER FORMS OF  
THYROID CANCER
Anaplastic  Thyroid  Cancer  As  noted  above,  ATC  is  a  poorly 
differentiated and aggressive cancer. The prognosis is poor, and most 
patients  die  within  6  months  of  diagnosis.  Because  of  the  undiffer-
entiated  state  of  these  tumors,  the  uptake  of  radioiodine  is  usually 
negligible, but it can be used therapeutically if there is residual uptake. 
Chemotherapy  has  been  attempted  with  multiple  agents,  including 
anthracyclines and paclitaxel, but it is usually ineffective. External beam 
radiation therapy can be attempted and continued if tumors are respon-
sive. Both multitargeted and mutation-directed kinase inhibitors are in 
clinical trials and may prolong survival by a few months.
Thyroid Lymphoma  Lymphoma in the thyroid gland often arises 
in  the  background  of  Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis.  A  rapidly  expanding 
thyroid mass suggests the possibility of this diagnosis. Diffuse large-cell

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismlymphoma  is  the  most  common  type  in  the  thyroid.  Biopsies  reveal 
sheets of lymphoid cells that can be difficult to distinguish from small-
cell  lung  cancer  or  ATC.  These  tumors  are  often  highly  sensitive  to 
external radiation. Surgical resection should be avoided as initial therapy 
because it may spread disease that is otherwise localized to the thyroid. If 
staging indicates disease outside of the thyroid, treatment should follow 
guidelines used for other forms of lymphoma (Chap. 108).
 ■ MEDULLARY THYROID CARCINOMA
MTC can be sporadic or familial and accounts for ~5% of thyroid can-
cers. There are three familial forms of MTC: MEN 2A, MEN 2B, and 
familial MTC without other features of MEN (Chap. 388). In general, 
MTC  is  more  aggressive  in  MEN  2B  than  in  MEN  2A,  and  familial 
MTC is more aggressive than sporadic MTC. Elevated serum calcito-
nin provides a marker of residual or recurrent disease. All patients with 
MTC should be tested for RET mutations, because genetic counseling 
and testing of family members can be offered to those individuals who 
test positive for mutations.

The  management  of  MTC  is  primarily  surgical.  Prior  to  surgery, 
pheochromocytoma  should  be  excluded  in  all  patients  with  a  RET 
mutation.  Unlike  tumors  derived  from  thyroid  follicular  cells,  these 
tumors do not take up radioiodine. External radiation treatment and 
targeted  kinase  inhibitors  may  provide  palliation  in  patients  with 
advanced disease (Chap. 388).

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Thyroid Nodules

Palpable thyroid nodules are found in ~5% of adults, but the prev-
alence  varies  considerably  worldwide.  Given  this  high  prevalence 

rate, practitioners may identify thyroid nodules on physical exami-
nation. However, the increased usage of diagnostic medical imaging 
(e.g., carotid ultrasound, cervical spine MRI) has led to an increased 
frequency of incidental nodule detection, accounting for the major-
ity of patients currently presenting for nodule evaluation. The main 
goal of this evaluation is to identify, in a cost-effective manner, the 
small subgroup of individuals with malignant lesions that have the 
potential to be clinically significant.

Nodules are more common in iodine-deficient areas, in women, 
and with aging. Most palpable nodules are >1 cm in diameter, but 
the ability to feel a nodule is influenced by its location within the 
gland (superficial vs deeply embedded), the anatomy of the patient’s 
neck, and the experience of the examiner. More sensitive methods 
of detection, such as CT, thyroid ultrasound, and pathologic studies, 
reveal thyroid nodules in up to 50% of glands in individuals aged 
>50 years. The presence of these thyroid incidentalomas has led to 
much  debate  about  how  to  detect  nodules  and  which  nodules  to 
investigate further.

An  approach  to  the  evaluation  of  thyroid  nodules  detected  by 
either palpation or imaging is outlined in Fig. 385-5. Most patients 
with  thyroid  nodules  have  normal  thyroid  function  tests.  None-
theless,  thyroid  function  should  be  assessed  by  measuring  a  TSH 
level,  which  may  be  suppressed  by  one  or  more  autonomously 
functioning nodules. If the TSH is suppressed, a radionuclide scan 
is indicated to determine if the identified nodule is “hot,” as lesions 
with  increased  uptake  are  almost  never  malignant  and  FNA  is 
unnecessary. Otherwise, the next step in evaluation is performance 
of a thyroid ultrasound for three reasons: (1) For nodules detected 
on  physical  examination,  ultrasound  will  confirm  if  the  palpable 
nodule  is  indeed  a  nodule.  About  15%  of  “palpable”  nodules  are

not confirmed on imaging, and therefore no further evaluation is 
required.  (2)  Ultrasound  will  assess  if  there  are  additional  non-
palpable nodules for which FNA may be recommended based on 
imaging  features  and  size.  (3)  Ultrasound  will  characterize  the 
imaging pattern of the nodule, which, combined with the nodule’s 
size, facilitates decision-making about FNA. There are several val-
idated risk stratification systems (RSS) for sonographic imaging of 
thyroid  nodules  (American  College  of  Radiology  [ACR]  Thyroid 
Imaging Reporting and Data System [TI-RADS], American Thyroid 
Association, European Thyroid Association [EU-TIRADS], among 
others).  These  demonstrate  consistent  risk  estimates  for  thyroid 
cancer based on certain sonographic patterns. All provide size cutoff 
recommendations for nodule FNA based on sonographic patterns, 
with lower size cutoffs for nodules with more suspicious ultrasound 
patterns, but the specific size cutoff criteria differ among the RSS. 
Not surprisingly, the RSSs with lower size cutoffs have higher sensi-
tivity and lower specificity for thyroid cancer diagnosis than those 
with  higher  cutoffs.  Nevertheless,  all  have  been  shown  to  reduce 
unnecessary FNAs by at least 45%, in part due to the recommenda-
tion not to perform FNA for spongiform nodules. ACR TI-RADS 
is  currently  the  most  widely  used  RSS  in  the  United  States,  and 
nodules are classified from TR1 to TR5 (Fig. 385-1).

For  example,  a  spongiform  nodule  (TR1)  has  a  <3%  chance 
of  cancer,  and  observation  rather  than  FNA  is  generally  recom-
mended by all RSSs, whereas 10–20% of solid hypoechoic nodules 
with  smooth  borders  (TR4)  are  malignant  and  FNA  is  recom-
mended at size cutoffs ranging from 1–1.5 cm. All the RSSs recom-
mend FNA at 1 cm for the highest suspicion pattern nodule, TR5  
(Figs. 385-1 and 385-2). Given what is known about the prevalence 
and  generally  indolent  behavior  of  small  thyroid  cancers  <1  cm, 
none  of  the  RSSs  recommend  FNA  for  any  nodule  <1  cm  unless 
metastatic cervical lymph nodes are present.

FNA biopsy, ideally performed with ultrasound guidance, is the 
best  diagnostic  test  when  performed  by  physicians  familiar  with 
the procedure and when the results are interpreted by experienced 
cytopathologists. The technique is particularly useful for detecting 
PTC. However, the distinction between benign and malignant fol-
licular patterned lesions is often not possible using cytology alone 
because of the absence of characteristic nuclear features in follicular 
carcinoma.  Using  the  current  ultrasound  RSS  for  FNA  decision-
making,  FNA  biopsies  yield  the  following  spectrum  of  cytology 
diagnoses: 55–60% benign, 5% malignant or suspicious for malig-
nancy,  5–7%  nondiagnostic  or  yielding  insufficient  material  for 
diagnosis, and 25–30% indeterminate. The Bethesda System is now 
widely  used  to  provide  more  uniform  terminology  for  reporting 
thyroid nodule FNA cytology results. This six-tiered classification 
system with the respective estimated malignancy rates is shown in 
Table  385-4.  Importantly,  because  NIFTP  can  only  be  diagnosed 
by  surgical  pathology,  NIFTP  is  included  in  the  malignancy  esti-
mates.  Specifically,  the  Bethesda  System  subcategorized  cytology 
specimens  previously  labeled  as  indeterminate  into  three  catego-
ries: atypia or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/
FLUS), follicular neoplasm, and suspicious for malignancy.

Cytology results indicative of malignancy generally mandate sur-
gery, after performing preoperative sonography to evaluate the cer-
vical  lymph  nodes.  Nondiagnostic  cytology  specimens  most  often 
result from cystic lesions but may also occur in fibrous long-standing 
nodules or very vascular nodules where a longer needle dwell time 
may  result  in  a  hemorrhagic  specimen.  Ultrasound-guided  FNA  is 
indicated when a repeat FNA is necessary. Repeat FNA will yield a 
diagnostic  cytology  in  ~50%  of  cases.  Given  the  low  false-negative 
rate  of  a  benign  cytology  (<3%),  benign  nodules  with  a  low  suspi-
cion  sonographic  pattern  (TR2,  TR3)  can  be  followed.  Those  with 
more worrisome ultrasound features, especially TR5 nodules, should 
undergo  repeat  FNA  because  of  a  higher  likelihood  of  a  missed 
malignancy. The use of LT4 to suppress serum TSH is not effective in 
shrinking nodules in iodine-replete populations, and therefore, LT4 
suppression  should  not  be  used.  The  three  indeterminate  cytology 
classifications  introduced  by  the  Bethesda  System  are  associated 
with  different  risks  of  malignancy  (Table  385-4).  For  nodules  with 
suspicious  for  malignancy  cytology,  surgery  is  recommended  after 
ultrasound assessment of cervical lymph nodes. Options to be dis-
cussed with the patient include lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy.
On the other hand, the majority of nodules with AUS/FLUS and 
follicular neoplasm cytology results are benign; the range of malig-
nancy (ROM) varies from 10 to 40%. The traditional approach for 
these patients is diagnostic lobectomy for histopathologic diagnosis. 
Therefore, many patients undergo surgery for benign nodules. Over 
the past decade, the uncertainty about the ROM for indeterminate 
cytology nodules has been the driver for the development of molec-
ular testing, which can better differentiate benign from malignant 
nodules. Based on results from next-generation sequencing, which 
includes  point  mutations,  small  insertions/deletions,  and  gene 
fusions, as well as results from microRNA analyses and gene expres-
sion,  the  current  validated  and  commercially  available  molecular 
tests combine these techniques with the following two goals: (1) risk 
stratification of thyroid nodules based on a positive result; and (2) 
reduction in cancer risk to an acceptable level for nonsurgical sur-
veillance based on a negative result. Assuming a 25–30% ROM for 
nodules with indeterminate cytology, the negative predictive values 
for the currently validated molecular tests are >95%.

The evaluation of a thyroid nodule is stressful for most patients. 
They are concerned about the possibility of thyroid cancer, whether 
verbalized or not. It is constructive, therefore, to review the diag-
nostic  approach  and  to  reassure  patients  when  no  malignancy  is 
found. When a suspicious lesion or thyroid cancer is identified, the 
generally  favorable  prognosis  and  available  treatment  options  can 
be reassuring.

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolism386 Disorders of the  
Adrenal Cortex
Wiebke Arlt

The adrenal cortex produces three classes of corticosteroid hormones: 
glucocorticoids  (e.g.,  cortisol),  mineralocorticoids  (e.g.,  aldoster-
one), and adrenal androgen precursors (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone 
[DHEA])  (Fig.  386-1).  Glucocorticoids  and  mineralocorticoids  act 
through  specific  nuclear  receptors,  regulating  aspects  of  the  physio-
logic stress response as well as blood pressure and electrolyte homeo-
stasis. Adrenal androgen precursors are converted in the gonads and 
peripheral target cells to sex steroids that act via nuclear androgen and 
estrogen receptors.

Disorders  of  the  adrenal  cortex  are  characterized  by  deficiency 
or  excess  of  one  or  several  of  the  three  major  corticosteroid  classes. 
Hormone  deficiency  can  be  caused  by  inherited  glandular  or  enzy-
matic disorders or by destruction of the pituitary or adrenal gland by 
autoimmune disorders, infection, infarction, or iatrogenic events such 
as  surgery  or  hormonal  suppression.  Hormone  excess  is  usually  the 
result of neoplasia, leading to increased production of adrenocortico-
tropic  hormone  (ACTH)  by  the  pituitary  or  neuroendocrine  ectopic 
ACTH-producing  cells  or  increased  production  of  glucocorticoids, 
mineralocorticoids,  or  adrenal  androgen  precursors  by  adrenal  nod-
ules.  Adrenal  nodules  are  increasingly  identified  incidentally  during 
cross-sectional  imaging  of  chest  or  abdomen  performed  for  other 
reasons.

in  response  to  endogenous  or  exogenous  stress.  CRH  stimulates 
the  cleavage  of  the  241–amino  acid  polypeptide  proopiomelanocor-
tin  (POMC)  by  pituitary-specific  prohormone  convertase  1  (PC1), 
yielding the 39–amino acid peptide ACTH. ACTH is released by the 
corticotrope cells of the anterior pituitary and acts as the pivotal reg-
ulator of adrenal cortisol synthesis, with additional short-term effects 
on  mineralocorticoid  and  adrenal  androgen  synthesis.  The  release 
of  CRH,  and  subsequently  ACTH,  occurs  in  a  pulsatile  fashion  that 
follows  a  circadian  rhythm  under  the  control  of  the  hypothalamus, 
specifically  its  suprachiasmatic  nucleus  (SCN),  with  additional  reg-
ulation  by  a  complex  network  of  cell-specific  clock  genes.  Reflecting 
the  pattern  of  ACTH  secretion,  adrenal  cortisol  secretion  exhibits  a 
distinct circadian rhythm, starting to rise in the early morning hours 
prior to awakening, with peak levels in the morning and low levels in 
the evening (Fig. 386-3).

Diagnostic tests assessing the HPA axis make use of the fact that it 
is regulated by negative feedback. Glucocorticoid excess is diagnosed 
by  employing  a  dexamethasone  suppression  test.  Dexamethasone,  a 
potent  synthetic  glucocorticoid,  suppresses  CRH/ACTH  by  binding 
hypothalamic-pituitary glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and, therefore, 
results  in  downregulation  of  endogenous  cortisol  synthesis.  Various 
versions of the dexamethasone suppression test are described in detail 
in Chap. 380. If cortisol production is autonomous (e.g., adrenal nod-
ule), ACTH is already suppressed, and dexamethasone has little addi-
tional effect. If cortisol production is driven by an ACTH-producing 
pituitary  adenoma,  dexamethasone  suppression  is  ineffective  at  low 
doses but usually induces suppression at high doses. If cortisol produc-
tion is driven by an ectopic source of ACTH, the tumors are usually 
resistant  to  dexamethasone  suppression.  Thus,  the  dexamethasone 
suppression test is useful to establish the diagnosis of Cushing’s syn-
drome and assist with the differential diagnosis of cortisol excess.

Conversely, to assess glucocorticoid deficiency, ACTH stimulation 
of cortisol production is used. The ACTH peptide contains 39 amino 
acids, but the first 24 are sufficient to elicit a physiologic response. The 
standard ACTH stimulation test involves administration of cosyntropin 
(ACTH 1-24), 0.25 mg IM or IV, and collection of blood samples at 0, 
30, and 60 min for cortisol. A normal response is defined as a cortisol 
level >15–20 μg/dL (>400–550 nmol/L) 30–60 min after cosyntropin 
stimulation,  with  the  precise  cutoff  dependent  on  the  assay  used.  A 
low-dose (1 μg cosyntropin IV) version of this test has been advocated; 
however, it has no superior diagnostic value and is more cumbersome 
to carry out. Alternatively, an insulin tolerance test (ITT) can be used 
to  assess  adrenal  function.  It  involves  injection  of  insulin  to  induce 
hypoglycemia,  which  represents  a  strong  stress  signal  that  triggers

initially to the subcapsular region and then meanders from the outer 
cortical zona glomerulosa through the intermediate zona fasciculata to 
the inner zona reticularis and eventually to the adrenal medulla. The 
right suprarenal vein drains directly into the vena cava, while the left 
suprarenal vein drains into the left renal vein.

During early embryonic development, the adrenals originate from 

the  urogenital  ridge  and  then  separate  from 
gonads  and  kidneys  at  about  the  sixth  week  of 
gestation.  Concordant  with  the  time  of  sexual 
differentiation (seventh to ninth week of gestation, 
Chap.  390),  the  adrenal  cortex  starts  to  produce 
cortisol  and  the  adrenal  sex  steroid  precursor 
DHEA.  The  orphan  nuclear  receptors  SF1  (ste-
roidogenic factor 1; encoded by the gene NR5A1) 
and  DAX1  (dosage-sensitive  sex  reversal  gene  1; 
encoded by the gene NR0B1), among others, play 
a crucial role during this period of development, 
as  they  regulate  a  multitude  of  adrenal  genes 
involved in steroidogenesis.

 ■ REGULATORY CONTROL OF 
STEROIDOGENESIS
Production  of  glucocorticoids  and  adrenal 
androgens  is  under  the  control  of  the  hypo-
thalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis,  whereas 
mineralocorticoids  are 
the 
regulated  by 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system.

Glucocorticoid  synthesis  is  under  inhibitory 
feedback  control  by  the  hypothalamus  and  the 
pituitary  (Fig.  386-2).  Hypothalamic  release  of 
corticotropin-releasing  hormone  (CRH)  occurs

hypothalamic  CRH  release  and  activation  of  the  entire  HPA  axis. 
The ITT involves administration of regular insulin 0.1 U/kg IV (dose 
should  be  lower  if  hypopituitarism  is  likely)  and  collection  of  blood 
samples  at  0,  30,  60,  and  120  min  for  glucose,  cortisol,  and  growth 
hormone  (GH),  if  also  assessing  the  GH  axis.  Oral  or  IV  glucose  is 
administered after the patient has achieved symptomatic hypoglycemia 
(usually plasma glucose <40 mg/dL). A normal response is defined as a 
cortisol >20 μg/dL and GH >5.1 μg/L, again with assay-specific cutoff 
variability. The ITT requires careful clinical monitoring and sequential 
measurements of glucose. It is contraindicated in patients with coro-
nary disease, cerebrovascular disease, or seizure disorders, which has 
made the short cosyntropin test the commonly accepted first-line test.
Mineralocorticoid production is controlled by the RAA regulatory 
cycle,  which  is  initiated  by  the  release  of  renin  from  the  juxtaglom-
erular cells in the kidney, resulting in cleavage of angiotensinogen to 
angiotensin I in the liver (Fig. 386-4). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE)  cleaves  angiotensin  I  to  angiotensin  II,  which  binds  and  acti-
vates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 receptor [AT1R]), result-
ing in increased adrenal aldosterone production and vasoconstriction. 
Aldosterone  enhances  sodium  retention  and  potassium  excretion 
and increases the arterial perfusion pressure, which in turn regulates 
renin release. Because mineralocorticoid synthesis is primarily under 
the  control  of  the  RAA  system,  hypothalamic-pituitary  damage  does 
not  significantly  impact  the  capacity  of  the  adrenal  to  synthesize 
aldosterone.

Similar to the HPA axis, the assessment of the RAA system can be 
used  for  diagnostic  purposes.  If  mineralocorticoid  excess  is  present, 
there  is  a  counter-regulatory  downregulation  of  plasma  renin  (see 
below for testing). Conversely, in mineralocorticoid deficiency, plasma 
renin is markedly increased. Physiologically, oral or IV sodium loading 
results in suppression of aldosterone, a response that is attenuated or 
absent in patients with autonomous mineralocorticoid excess.

 ■ STEROID HORMONE SYNTHESIS,  
METABOLISM, AND ACTION
ACTH stimulation is required for the initiation of steroidogenesis. The 
ACTH  receptor  MC2R  (melanocortin  2  receptor)  interacts  with  the 

MC2R-accessory  protein  MRAP,  and  the  complex  is  transported  to  
the adrenocortical cell membrane, where it binds to ACTH (Fig. 386-5). 
ACTH stimulation generates cyclic AMP (cAMP), which upregulates 
the  protein  kinase  A  (PKA)  signaling  pathway.  Inactive  PKA  is  a 
tetramer of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits that is dissociated 
by cAMP into a dimer of two regulatory subunits bound to cAMP and 
two free and active catalytic subunits. PKA activation impacts steroi-
dogenesis in three distinct ways: (1) increases the import of cholesterol 
esters;  (2)  increases  the  activity  of  hormone-sensitive  lipase,  which 
cleaves cholesterol esters to cholesterol for import into the mitochon-
drion; and (3) increases the availability and phosphorylation of CREB 
(cAMP response element binding), a transcription factor that enhances 
transcription of CYP11A1 and other enzymes required for glucocorti-
coid synthesis.

Adrenal  steroidogenesis  occurs  in  a  zone-specific  fashion,  with 
mineralocorticoid synthesis occurring in the outer zona glomerulosa, 
glucocorticoid synthesis in the zona fasciculata, and adrenal androgen 
biosynthesis  in  the  inner  zona  reticularis  serving  as  precursors  for 
both  classic  and  11-oxygenated  androgens  (Fig.  386-1).  All  steroido-
genic  pathways  require  cholesterol  import  into  the  mitochondrion,  a 
process  initiated  by  the  action  of  the  steroidogenic  acute  regulatory 
(StAR) protein, which shuttles cholesterol from the outer to the inner 
mitochondrial  membrane.  The  majority  of  steroidogenic  enzymes 
are  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  enzymes,  which  are  either  located  in 
the  mitochondrion  (side  chain  cleavage  enzyme,  CYP11A1;  11β- 
hydroxylase,  CYP11B1;  aldosterone  synthase,  CYP11B2)  or  in  the 
endoplasmic  reticulum  membrane  (17α-hydroxylase,  CYP17A1; 
21-hydroxylase,  CYP21A2;  aromatase,  CYP19A1).  These  enzymes 
require  electron  donation  via  specific  redox  cofactor  enzymes,  P450 
oxidoreductase  (POR),  and  adrenodoxin/adrenodoxin  reductase 
(ADX/ADR)  for  the  microsomal  and  mitochondrial  CYP  enzymes, 
respectively.  In  addition,  the  short-chain  dehydrogenase  3β-hy-
droxysteroid  dehydrogenase  type  2  (3β-HSD2),  also  termed  Δ4,  Δ5 
isomerase, plays a major role in adrenal steroidogenesis.

The  cholesterol  side  chain  cleavage  enzyme  CYP11A1  gener-
ates  pregnenolone.  Glucocorticoid  synthesis  requires  conversion  of 
pregnenolone  to  progesterone  by  3β-HSD2,  followed  by  conversion

to  17-hydroxyprogesterone  (17OHP)  by  CYP17A1,  further  hydroxy-
lation  at  carbon  21  by  CYP21A2,  and  eventually,  11β-hydroxylation 
by  CYP11B1  to  generate  active  cortisol  (Fig.  386-1).  Mineralocor-
ticoid  synthesis  also  requires  progesterone,  which  is  first  converted 
to  deoxycorticosterone  (DOC)  by  CYP21A2  and  then  converted  via 
corticosterone  and  18-hydroxycorticosterone  to  aldosterone  in  three 
steps catalyzed by CYP11B2. For adrenal androgen synthesis, pregne-
nolone undergoes conversion by CYP17A1, which uniquely catalyzes 
two  enzymatic  reactions.  Via  its  17α-hydroxylase  activity,  CYP17A1 
converts pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone, followed by gener-
ation of the universal sex steroid precursor DHEA via CYP17A1 17,20 
lyase activity. The majority of DHEA is secreted by the adrenal in the 
form of its sulfate ester, DHEAS, generated by DHEA sulfotransferase 
(SULT2A1).  DHEA  is  converted  to  androstenedione,  which  can  be 
activated to testosterone or channeled into the 11-oxygenated andro-
gen pathway by 11β-hydroxylation (CYP11B1).

Following  its  release  from  the  adrenal,  cortisol  circulates  in  the 
bloodstream  mainly  bound  to  cortisol-binding  globulin  (CBG)  and, 
to a lesser extent, to albumin, with only a minor fraction circulating as 
free, unbound hormone. Free cortisol is thought to enter cells directly, 
not requiring active transport. In addition, in a multitude of peripheral 
target tissues of glucocorticoid action, including adipose, liver, muscle, 
and brain, cortisol is generated from inactive cortisone within the cell 
by the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) 
(Fig. 386-6). Thereby, 11β-HSD1 functions as a tissue-specific prere-
ceptor regulator of glucocorticoid action. For the conversion of inactive 
cortisone to active cortisol, 11β-HSD1 requires nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH [reduced form]), which is provided 
by the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH). Like the 
catalytic domain of 11β-HSD1, H6PDH is located in the lumen of the 
endoplasmic  reticulum  and  converts  glucose-6-phosphate  (G6P)  to 
6-phosphogluconate (6PGL), thereby regenerating NADP+ to NADPH, 
which drives the activation of cortisol from cortisone by 11β-HSD1.

In  the  cytosol  of  target  cells,  cortisol  binds  and  activates  the  GR, 
which  results  in  dissociation  of  heat  shock  proteins  (HSPs)  from  the 
receptor  and  subsequent  dimerization  (Fig.  386-6).  Cortisol-bound 
GR  dimers  translocate  to  the  nucleus  and  activate  glucocorticoid 
response  elements  (GREs)  in  the  DNA  sequence,  thereby  enhancing 

transcription  of  glucocorticoid-regulated  genes  (GR  transactivation). 
However,  cortisol-bound  GR  can  also  form  heterodimers  with  tran-
scription  factors  such  as  AP-1  or  NF-κB,  resulting  in  transrepression 
of proinflammatory genes, a mechanism of major importance for the 
anti-inflammatory  action  of  glucocorticoids.  It  is  important  to  note 
that  corticosterone  also  exerts  glucocorticoid  activity,  albeit  much 
weaker than cortisol itself. However, in rodents, corticosterone is the 
major glucocorticoid, and in patients with 17-hydroxylase deficiency, 
lack of cortisol can be compensated for by higher concentrations of cor-
ticosterone that accumulates as a consequence of the enzymatic block.
Cortisol  is  inactivated  to  cortisone  by  the  microsomal  enzyme 
11β-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase  type  2  (11β-HSD2)  (Fig.  386-7), 
mainly in the kidney, but also in the colon, salivary glands, and other 
target  tissues.  Cortisol  and  aldosterone  bind  the  mineralocorticoid 
receptor  (MR)  with  equal  affinity;  however,  cortisol  circulates  in  the 
bloodstream  at  about  a  1000-fold  higher  concentration.  Thus,  only 
rapid inactivation of cortisol to cortisone by 11β-HSD2 prevents MR 
activation by excess cortisol, thereby acting as a tissue-specific modu-
lator of the MR pathway. In addition to cortisol and aldosterone, DOC 
(Fig. 386-1) also exerts mineralocorticoid activity. DOC accumulation 
due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency or due to tumor-related excess pro-
duction can result in mineralocorticoid excess.

Aldosterone  synthesis  in  the  adrenal  zona  glomerulosa  cells  is 
driven by the enzyme aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2). The binding of 
angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor causes glomerulosa cell membrane 
depolarization  by  increasing  intracellular  sodium  through  inhibition 
of sodium potassium (Na+/K+) ATPase enzymes as well as potassium 
channels. This drives an increase in intracellular calcium by opening 
of voltage-dependent calcium channels or inhibition of calcium (Ca2+) 
ATPase enzymes. Consequently, the calcium signaling pathway is trig-
gered, resulting in upregulation of CYP11B2 transcription (Fig. 386-8).
Analogous  to  cortisol  action  via  the  GR,  aldosterone  (or  cortisol) 
binding to the MR in the kidney tubule cell dissociates the HSP-receptor 
complex,  allowing  homodimerization  of  the  MR  and  translocation 
of  the  hormone-bound  MR  dimer  to  the  nucleus  (Fig.  386-7).  The 
activated  MR  enhances  transcription  of  the  epithelial  sodium  chan-
nel  (ENaC)  and  serum  glucocorticoid-inducible  kinase  1  (SGK-1).

within the Nedd4 protein, reduces the interaction between Nedd4 and 
ENaC, and consequently, enhances the trafficking of ENaC to the cell 
surface, where it mediates sodium retention.

 ■ CUSHING’S SYNDROME
(See  also  Chap.  380)  Cushing’s  syndrome  reflects  a  constellation 
of  clinical  features  that  result  from  chronic  exposure  to  excess 

glucocorticoids of any etiology. The disorder can be ACTH-dependent 
(e.g.,  pituitary  corticotrope  adenoma,  ectopic  secretion  of  ACTH  by 
nonpituitary tumor) or ACTH-independent (e.g., adrenocortical ade-
noma, adrenocortical carcinoma [ACC], nodular adrenal hyperplasia), 
as well as iatrogenic (e.g., administration of exogenous glucocorticoids 
to treat various inflammatory conditions). The term Cushing’s disease 
refers specifically to Cushing’s syndrome caused by a pituitary cortico-
trope adenoma.

Etiology 
In  at  least  90%  of  patients  with 
Cushing’s disease, ACTH excess is caused by 
a corticotrope pituitary microadenoma, often 
only a few millimeters in diameter. Pituitary 
macroadenomas (i.e., tumors >1 cm in size) 
are found in only 5–10% of patients. Pituitary 
corticotrope  adenomas  usually  occur  spo-
radically but very rarely can be found in the 
context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 
1 (MEN 1) (Chap. 388). Pituitary adenomas 
causative of Cushing’s disease frequently har-
bor  mutations  in  the  deubiquitinase  USP8, 
which leads to constitutive activation of epi-
dermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  signaling  and 
consequent  upregulated  expression  of  the 
ACTH  precursor  POMC.  USP8  mutations 
are  found  more  frequently  in  adults  (41  vs 
17% in children) and in women (43 vs 17% 
in men) with Cushing’s disease.

Ectopic  ACTH  production  is  predomi-
nantly  caused  by  occult  carcinoid  tumors, 
most  frequently  in  the  lung,  but  also  in 
thymus  or  pancreas.  Because  of  their  small 
size, these tumors are often difficult to locate. 
Advanced  small-cell  lung  cancer  can  cause 
ectopic  ACTH  production.  In  rare  cases, 
ectopic  CRH  and/or  ACTH  production  has 
been found to originate from medullary thy-
roid  carcinoma  or  pheochromocytoma,  the 

Epidemiology  Cushing’s syndrome is generally considered a rare 
disease. It occurs with an incidence of 1–2 per 100,000 population per 
year. However, it is debated whether mild cortisol excess may be more 
prevalent among patients with features of Cushing’s such as centripetal 
obesity, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporotic vertebral fractures, recogniz-
ing that these are relatively nonspecific and common in the population.
In  the  overwhelming  majority  of  patients  with  endogenous  Cush-
ing’s  syndrome,  the  underlying  cause  is  an  ACTH-producing  corti-
cotrope adenoma of the pituitary (Table 386-1), as initially described 
by Harvey Cushing in 1912. Cushing’s disease more frequently affects 
women, with the exception of prepubertal cases, where it is more com-
mon in boys. By contrast, ectopic ACTH syndrome is more frequently 
identified in men. Only 10% of patients with Cushing’s syndrome have 
a  primary,  adrenal  cause  of  their  disease  (e.g.,  autonomous  cortisol 
excess independent of ACTH), and most of these patients are women. 
However,  overall,  the  medical  use  of  glucocorticoids  for  immuno-
suppression  or  for  the  treatment  of  inflammatory  disorders  is  the 
most  common  cause  of  Cushing’s  syndrome,  also  termed  iatrogenic 
Cushing’s.

latter co-secreting catecholamines and ACTH.

The  majority  of  patients  with  endogenous  ACTH-independent 
cortisol  excess  harbor  a  cortisol-producing  adrenal  adenoma,  and 
somatic  mutations  in  the  PKA  catalytic  subunit  PRKACA  have  been 
identified as cause of disease in 40% of these tumors. ACCs may also 
cause ACTH-independent disease and are often large, with excess pro-
duction of several corticosteroid classes.

A rare but notable cause of adrenal cortisol excess is primary bilat-
eral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH) with low circulating 
ACTH but with evidence for autocrine stimulation of cortisol produc-
tion  via  intraadrenal  ACTH  production.  These  hyperplastic  nodules 
are often also characterized by ectopic expression of G protein–coupled 
receptors  not  usually  found  in  the  adrenal,  including  receptors  for 
luteinizing hormone, vasopressin, serotonin, interleukin 1, catechola-
mines, or gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), the cause of food-dependent 
Cushing’s.  Activation  of  these  receptors  results  in  upregulation  of 
PKA  signaling,  as  physiologically  occurs  with  ACTH,  with  a  subse-
quent increase in cortisol production. A combination of germline and 
somatic  mutations  in  the  tumor-suppressor  gene  ARMC5  have  been 
identified as a prevalent cause of Cushing’s due to bilateral macronod-
ular adrenal hyperplasia; these patients often present with biochemical 
evidence  of  Cushing’s  but  lack  specific  clinical  signs,  which  develop 
slowly over decades and accelerate cardiovascular risk. Constitutively 
activating mutations in the PKA catalytic subunit PRKACA are found 
as somatic mutations in one-third of cortisol-producing adrenocortical 
adenomas and, as germline mutations, can also represent a rare cause 
of macronodular adrenal hyperplasia associated with cortisol excess.

Germline  mutations  in  one  of  the  regulatory  subunits  of  PKA, 
PRKAR1A,  are  found  in  patients  with  primary  pigmented  nodular 
adrenal  disease  (PPNAD)  as  part  of  Carney’s  complex,  an  autosomal 
dominant  multiple  neoplasia  condition  associated  with  cardiac  myx-
omas,  hyperlentiginosis,  Sertoli  cell  tumors,  and  PPNAD.  PPNAD 
can  present  as  micronodular  or  macronodular  hyperplasia,  or  both. 
Phosphodiesterases can influence intracellular cAMP and can thereby 
impact PKA activation. Mutations in PDE11A and PDE8B have been 
identified in patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing’s, 
with and without evidence of PPNAD.

Another  rare  cause  of  ACTH-independent  Cushing’s  is  McCune- 
Albright  syndrome,  also  associated  with  polyostotic  fibrous  dysplasia, 
unilateral café-au-lait spots, and precocious puberty. McCune-Albright

and protein catabolism causing the most prominent features. In addi-
tion,  excess  glucocorticoid  secretion  overcomes  the  ability  of  11β-
HSD2 to rapidly inactivate cortisol to cortisone in the kidney, thereby 
exerting mineralocorticoid actions, manifest as diastolic hypertension, 
hypokalemia,  and  edema.  Excess  glucocorticoids  also  interfere  with 
central  regulatory  systems,  leading  to  suppression  of  gonadotropins 
with  subsequent  hypogonadism  and  amenorrhea  and  suppression  of 
the  hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  axis,  resulting  in  decreased  thy-
roid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion.

The majority of clinical signs and symptoms observed in Cushing’s 
syndrome are relatively nonspecific and include features such as obe-
sity,  diabetes,  diastolic  hypertension,  hirsutism,  and  depression  that 
are  commonly  found  in  patients  who  do  not  have  Cushing’s.  There-
fore,  careful  clinical  assessment  is  an  important  aspect  of  evaluating 
suspected cases. A diagnosis of Cushing’s should be considered when 
several  clinical  features  are  found  in  the  same  patient,  in  particular 
when more specific features are found or manifest at an unusual age, 
e.g., osteoporosis in a young patient. Distinct features include fragility 
of  the  skin,  with  easy  bruising  and  broad  (>1  cm),  purplish  striae 
(Fig.  386-9),  and  signs  of  proximal  myopathy,  which  becomes  most 
obvious when trying to stand up from a chair without the use of hands 
or  when  climbing  stairs.  Clinical  manifestations  of  Cushing’s  do  not 
differ substantially among the different causes of Cushing’s. In ectopic 
ACTH  syndrome,  hyperpigmentation  of  the  knuckles,  scars,  or  skin 
areas exposed to increased friction can be observed (Fig. 386-9) and 
is  caused  by  stimulatory  effects  of  excess  ACTH  and  other  POMC 
cleavage  products  on  melanocyte  pigment  production.  Furthermore, 
patients  with  ectopic  ACTH  syndrome,  and  some  with  ACC  as  the 
cause of Cushing’s, may have a more brisk onset and rapid progression 
of  clinical  signs  and  symptoms,  namely  of  edema,  hypokalemia,  and 
hypertension.

Patients  with  Cushing’s  syndrome  can  be  acutely  endangered  by 
deep vein thrombosis, with subsequent pulmonary embolism, due to 
a  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  Cushing’s.  The  majority  of 
patients also experience psychiatric symptoms, mostly in the form of

2962 anxiety or depression, but acute paranoid or depressive psychosis may 
occur. Even after cure, long-term health may be affected by persistently 
impaired  health-related  quality  of  life  and  increased  risk  of  cardio-
vascular  disease  and  osteoporosis  with  vertebral  fractures,  depend-
ing  on  the  duration  and  degree  of  exposure  to  significant  cortisol  
excess.

Diagnosis  The  most  important  first  step  in  the  management  of 
patients with suspected Cushing’s syndrome is to establish the correct 
diagnosis.  Most  mistakes  in  clinical  management,  leading  to  unnec-
essary  imaging  or  surgery,  are  made  because  the  diagnostic  protocol 
is not followed (Fig. 386-10). This protocol requires establishing the 
diagnosis  of  Cushing’s  beyond  doubt  prior  to  employing  any  tests 
used for the differential diagnosis of the condition. In principle, after 
excluding exogenous glucocorticoid use as the cause of clinical signs 
and symptoms, suspected cases should be tested if there are multiple 
and  progressive  features  of  Cushing’s,  particularly  features  with  a 

potentially higher discriminatory value. Exclusion of Cushing’s is also 
indicated in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses.

A  diagnosis  of  Cushing’s  can  be  considered  as  established  if  the 
results of several tests are consistently suggestive of Cushing’s. These 
tests  may  include  increased  24-h  urinary  free  cortisol  excretion  in 
three  separate  collections,  failure  to  appropriately  suppress  morning 
cortisol  after  overnight  exposure  to  dexamethasone,  and  evidence 
of  loss  of  diurnal  cortisol  secretion  with  high  levels  at  midnight,  the 
time  of  the  physiologically  lowest  secretion  (Fig.  386-10).  Factors 
potentially affecting the outcome of these diagnostic tests have to be 
excluded  such  as  incomplete  24-h  urine  collection  or  rapid  inactiva-
tion of dexamethasone due to concurrent intake of CYP3A4-inducing 
drugs (e.g., antiepileptics, rifampicin). Concurrent intake of oral con-
traceptives that raise CBG and thus total cortisol can cause failure to 
suppress after dexamethasone. If in doubt, testing should be repeated 
after 4–6 weeks off estrogens. Patients with pseudo-Cushing states, i.e., 
alcohol-related,  and  those  with  cyclic  Cushing’s  may  require  further

testing  to  safely  confirm  or  exclude  the  diagnosis  of  Cushing’s.  In 
addition,  the  biochemical  assays  employed  can  affect  the  test  results, 
with specificity representing a common problem with antibody-based 
assays for the measurement of urinary free cortisol. These assays have 
been greatly improved by the introduction of highly specific tandem 
mass spectrometry.
Differential Diagnosis  The evaluation of patients with confirmed 
Cushing’s should be carried out by an endocrinologist and begins with 
the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent 
cortisol  excess  (Fig.  386-10).  Generally,  plasma  ACTH  levels  are 
suppressed  in  cases  of  autonomous  adrenal  cortisol  excess,  as  a  con-
sequence  of  enhanced  negative  feedback  to  the  hypothalamus  and 
pituitary. By contrast, patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing’s have 
normal or increased plasma ACTH, with very high levels being found 
in some patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome. Importantly, imaging 
should only be used after it is established whether the cortisol excess is 
ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent because nodules in the pitu-
itary or the adrenal are a common finding in the general population. In 
patients with confirmed ACTH-independent excess, adrenal imaging 
is indicated (Fig. 386-11), preferably using an unenhanced computed 
tomography (CT) scan. This allows assessment of adrenal morphology 
and  determination  of  precontrast  tumor  density  in  Hounsfield  units 
(HUs),  which  helps  to  distinguish  between  benign  and  malignant 
adrenal lesions.

For  ACTH-dependent  cortisol  excess  (Chap.  380),  a  magnetic 
resonance image (MRI) of the pituitary is the investigation of choice, 
but  it  may  not  show  an  abnormality  in  up  to  40%  of  cases  because 
of  small  tumors  below  the  sensitivity  of  detection.  Characteristically, 
pituitary corticotrope adenomas fail to enhance following gadolinium 
administration on T1-weighted MRI images. In all cases of confirmed 
ACTH-dependent  Cushing’s,  further  tests  are  required  for  the  dif-
ferential  diagnosis  of  pituitary  Cushing’s  disease  and  ectopic  ACTH 
syndrome. These tests exploit the fact that most pituitary corticotrope 
adenomas  still  display  regulatory  features,  including  residual  ACTH 
suppression by high-dose glucocorticoids and CRH responsiveness. In 
contrast, ectopic sources of ACTH are typically resistant to dexametha-
sone  suppression  and  unresponsive  to  CRH  (Fig.  386-10).  However, 
it should be noted that a small minority of ectopic ACTH-producing 
tumors  exhibit  dynamic  responses  similar  to  pituitary  corticotrope 
tumors. If the two tests show discordant results or if there is any other 
reason for doubt, the differential diagnosis can be further clarified by 
performing bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) with con-
current blood sampling for ACTH in the right and left inferior petrosal 
sinus  and  a  peripheral  vein.  An  increased  central/peripheral  plasma 
ACTH ratio >2 at baseline and >3 at 2–5 min after CRH injection is 
indicative of Cushing’s disease (Fig. 386-10), with very high sensitivity 
and specificity. Of note, the results of the IPSS cannot be reliably used 
for  lateralization  (i.e.,  prediction  of  the  location  of  the  tumor  within 
the pituitary) because there is broad interindividual variability in the 
venous drainage of the pituitary region. Importantly, no cortisol-low-
ering agents should be used prior to IPSS.

If  the  differential  diagnostic  testing  indicates  ectopic  ACTH  syn-
drome, then further imaging should include high-resolution, fine-cut 
CT scanning of the chest and abdomen for scrutiny of the lung, thy-
mus,  and  pancreas.  If  no  lesions  are  identified,  an  MRI  of  the  chest 
can be considered because carcinoid tumors usually show high signal 
intensity on T2-weighted images. Furthermore, octreotide scintigraphy 
can be helpful in some cases because ectopic ACTH-producing tumors 
often  express  somatostatin  receptors.  Depending  on  the  suspected 
cause,  patients  with  ectopic  ACTH  syndrome  should  also  undergo 
blood sampling for fasting gut hormones, chromogranin A, calcitonin, 
and biochemical exclusion of pheochromocytoma.

removal  of  the  adrenal  tumor.  For  smaller  tumors,  a  minimally 
invasive approach can be used, whereas for larger tumors and those 
suspected of malignancy, an open approach is preferred.

In Cushing’s disease, the treatment of choice is selective removal 
of the pituitary corticotrope tumor, usually via an endoscopic trans-
sphenoidal approach. This results in an initial cure rate of 70–80% 
when performed by a highly experienced surgeon. However, even 
after  initial  remission  following  surgery,  long-term  follow-up  is 
important  because  late  relapse  occurs  in  a  significant  number 
of  patients.  If  pituitary  disease  recurs,  there  are  several  options, 
including  second  surgery,  radiotherapy,  stereotactic  radiosurgery, 
and bilateral adrenalectomy. These options need to be applied in a 
highly individualized fashion.

In some patients with very severe, overt Cushing’s (e.g., difficult 
to  control  hypokalemic  hypertension  or  acute  psychosis),  it  may 
be  necessary  to  introduce  medical  therapy  to  rapidly  control  the 
cortisol excess during the period leading up to surgery, which also 
can  help  to  alleviate  hypercoagulability  and,  thus,  operative  risk. 
Similarly, patients with metastasized, glucocorticoid-producing car-
cinomas may require long-term antiglucocorticoid drug treatment. 
In case of ectopic ACTH syndrome, in which the tumor cannot be 
located, one must carefully weigh whether drug treatment or bilat-
eral adrenalectomy is the most appropriate choice, with the latter 
facilitating  immediate  cure  but  requiring  life-long  corticosteroid 
replacement.  In  this  instance,  it  is  paramount  to  ensure  regular 
imaging follow-up for identification of the ectopic ACTH source.

Oral  agents  with  established  efficacy  in  Cushing’s  syndrome  are 
metyrapone and ketoconazole. Metyrapone inhibits cortisol synthe-
sis at the level of 11β-hydroxylase (Fig. 386-1), whereas the antimy-
cotic  drug  ketoconazole  inhibits  the  early  steps  of  steroidogenesis. 
Typical  starting  doses  are  500  mg  tid  for  metyrapone  (maximum 
dose, 6 g) and 200 mg tid for ketoconazole (maximum dose, 1200 
mg). Recently, the potent 11β-hydroxylase inhibitor osilodrostat has 
been  introduced  for  the  treatment  of  Cushing’s,  which  also  exerts 
strong  inhibition  of  aldosterone  synthase  (CYP11B2).  Mitotane,  a 
derivative  of  the  insecticide  o,p’DDD,  is  an  adrenolytic  agent  that 
is also effective for reducing cortisol. Because of its side effect pro-
file, it is most commonly used in the context of ACC, but low-dose 
treatment (500–1000 mg/d) has also been used in benign Cushing’s. 
In severe cases of cortisol excess, etomidate, an agent that potently 
blocks  11β-hydroxylase  and  aldosterone  synthase,  can  be  used  to 
lower cortisol. It is administered by continuous IV infusion in low, 
nonanesthetic doses. For Cushing’s disease, the subcutaneous admin-
istration  of  pasireotide,  a  somatostatin  receptor  agonist,  represents 
another therapeutic option, if surgical cure cannot be achieved.

After the successful removal of an ACTH- or cortisol-producing 
tumor, the HPA axis will remain suppressed. Thus, hydrocortisone 
replacement needs to be initiated at the time of surgery and slowly 
tapered following recovery, to allow physiologic adaptation to nor-
mal cortisol levels. Depending on degree and duration of cortisol 
excess,  the  HPA  axis  may  require  many  months  or  even  years  to 
resume normal function and sometimes does not recover. Gener-
ally, ectopic ACTH syndrome shows the best recovery rate (80%) 
and adrenal Cushing’s has the lowest (40%), with Cushing’s disease 
intermediate (60%).

 ■ MINERALOCORTICOID EXCESS
Epidemiology  Following the first description of a patient with an 
aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma (Conn’s syndrome), mineralo-
corticoid excess was thought to represent a rare cause of hypertension. 
However,  in  studies  systematically  screening  all  patients  with  hyper-
tension,  a  much  higher  prevalence  is  now  recognized,  ranging  from 
5 to 12%. The prevalence is higher when patients are preselected for 
hypokalemic hypertension.

Etiology  The  most  common  cause  of  mineralocorticoid  excess  is 
primary  aldosteronism,  reflecting  excess  production  of  aldosterone  by 
the  adrenal  zona  glomerulosa.  Bilateral  micronodular  hyperplasia  is

somewhat more common than unilateral adrenal adenomas (Table 386-3).  
Somatic mutations in channels and enzymes responsible for increasing 
sodium  and  calcium  influx  in  adrenal  zona  glomerulosa  cells  have 
been identified as prevalent causes of aldosterone-producing adrenal 
adenomas (Table 386-3) and, in the case of germline mutations, also 
of  primary  aldosteronism  due  to  bilateral  macronodular  adrenal 
hyperplasia. However, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia as a cause of min-
eralocorticoid  excess  is  usually  micronodular  but  can  also  contain 
larger  nodules  that  might  be  mistaken  for  a  unilateral  adenoma.  In 
rare instances, primary aldosteronism is caused by an ACC. Carcino-
mas should be considered in younger patients and in those with larger 
tumors  because  benign  aldosterone-producing  adenomas  usually 
measure <2 cm in diameter.

A  rare  cause  of  aldosterone  excess  is  glucocorticoid-remediable 
aldosteronism  (GRA),  which  is  caused  by  a  chimeric  gene  resulting 
from  crossover  of  promoter  sequences  between  the  CYP11B1  and 
CYP11B2 genes that are involved in glucocorticoid and mineralocor-
ticoid  synthesis,  respectively  (Fig.  386-1).  This  rearrangement  brings 
CYP11B2 transcription under the control of ACTH receptor signaling; 
consequently,  aldosterone  production  is  regulated  by  ACTH  rather 
than by renin. The family history can be helpful because there may be 
evidence  for  dominant  transmission  of  hypertension.  Recognition  of 
the disorder is important because it can be associated with early-onset 
hypertension and strokes. In addition, glucocorticoid suppression can 
reduce aldosterone production.

Other  rare  causes  of  mineralocorticoid  excess  are  listed  in 
Table  386-3.  An  important  cause  is  excess  binding  and  activation  of 
the MR by a steroid other than aldosterone. Cortisol acts as a potent 
mineralocorticoid  if  it  escapes  efficient  inactivation  to  cortisone  by 
11β-HSD2  in  the  kidney  (Fig.  386-7).  This  can  be  caused  by  inac-
tivating  mutations  in  the  HSD11B2  gene  resulting  in  the  syndrome 

of  apparent  mineralocorticoid  excess  (SAME)  that  characteristi-
cally  manifests  with  severe  hypokalemic  hypertension  in  childhood. 
However,  milder  mutations  may  cause  normokalemic  hypertension 
manifesting  in  adulthood  (type  II  SAME).  Inhibition  of  11β-HSD2 
by excess licorice ingestion also results in hypokalemic hypertension, 
as  does  overwhelming  of  11β-HSD2  conversion  capacity  by  cortisol 
excess  in  Cushing’s  syndrome.  DOC  also  binds  and  activates  the 
MR  and  can  cause  hypertension  if  its  circulating  concentrations  are 
increased.  This  can  arise  through  autonomous  DOC  secretion  by  an 
ACC, but also when DOC accumulates as a consequence of an adrenal 
enzymatic block, as seen in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due 
to  CYP11B1  (11β-hydroxylase)  or  CYP17A1  (17α-hydroxylase)  defi-
ciency (Fig. 386-1). Progesterone can cause hypokalemic hypertension 
in rare individuals who harbor a MR mutation that enhances binding 
and activation by progesterone; physiologically, progesterone normally 
exerts  antimineralocorticoid  activity.  Finally,  excess  mineralocorti-
coid activity can be caused by mutations in the β or γ subunits of the 
ENaC, disrupting its interaction with Nedd4 (Fig. 386-7), and thereby 
decreasing receptor internalization and degradation. The constitutively 
active ENaC drives hypokalemic hypertension, resulting in an autoso-
mal dominant disorder termed Liddle’s syndrome.

Clinical  Manifestations  Excess  activation  of  the  MR  leads  to 
potassium  depletion  and  increased  sodium  retention,  with  the  latter 
causing  an  expansion  of  extracellular  and  plasma  volume.  Increased 
ENaC activity also results in hydrogen depletion that can cause meta-
bolic alkalosis. Aldosterone also has direct effects on the vascular sys-
tem, where it increases cardiac remodeling and decreases compliance. 
Aldosterone excess may cause direct damage to the myocardium and 
the kidney glomeruli, in addition to secondary damage due to systemic 
hypertension.

Autonomous aldosterone excess can be caused by somatic (intratumor) mutations in the potassium 
channel GIRK4 (encoded by KCNJ5; identified as cause of disease in 40% of aldosterone-producing 
adenomas; rare germline mutations can cause bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia). Further 
causes include somatic mutations affecting the α-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase (encoded by ATP1A1), 
the plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase 3 (encoded by ATP2B3), and somatic mutations in 
CACNA1D or CACNA1H encoding the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1.3 and CaV3.2, respectively. 
All mutations result in upregulation of CYP11B2 and hence aldosterone synthesis.
Autonomous aldosterone excess, mostly micronodular and rarely macronodular, with germline KCNJ5 
mutations being a rare cause.
Crossover between the CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 genes results in ACTH-driven aldosterone production

Mutations in HSD11B2 result in lack of renal inactivation of cortisol to cortisone, leading to excess 
activation of the MR by cortisol (inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 by excess 
licorice ingestion can have similar effects)
Cortisol excess overcomes the capacity of HSD11B2 to inactivate cortisol to cortisone, consequently

The  clinical  hallmark  of  mineralocorticoid  excess  is  hypokalemic 
hypertension; however, only 50% of patients with primary aldostero-
nism  exhibit  hypokalemia.  Serum  sodium  tends  to  be  normal  due 
to  the  concurrent  fluid  retention,  which  in  some  cases  can  lead  to 
peripheral edema. Hypomagnesemia is also a common finding. Hypo-
kalemia can be exacerbated by thiazide drug treatment, which leads to 
increased delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, thereby driving 
potassium excretion. Severe hypokalemia can be associated with mus-
cle weakness, overt proximal myopathy, or even hypokalemic paralysis. 
Severe alkalosis contributes to muscle cramps and, in severe cases, can 
cause tetany.

Of note, patients with primary aldosteronism show increased rates 
of osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive dysfunction. A signifi-
cant proportion of patients suffer from concurrent mild autonomous 
cortisol excess (MACE), termed Connshing syndrome.

Diagnosis  Diagnostic screening for mineralocorticoid excess is not 
currently recommended for all patients with hypertension but should 
be restricted to those who exhibit hypertension associated with drug 
resistance,  hypokalemia,  an  adrenal  mass,  or  onset  of  disease  before 
the age of 40 years (Fig. 386-12). The accepted screening test is con-
current measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone with subsequent 
calculation of the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) (Fig. 386-12); serum 
potassium  needs  to  be  normalized  prior  to  testing.  Stopping  antihy-
pertensive  medication  can  be  cumbersome,  particularly  in  patients 
with  severe  hypertension.  Thus,  for  practical  purposes,  in  the  first 
instance,  the  patient  can  remain  on  the  usual  antihypertensive  med-
ications,  with  the  exception  that  MR  antagonists  need  to  be  ceased 
at  least  4  weeks  prior  to  ARR  measurement.  The  remaining  antihy-
pertensive  drugs  usually  do  not  affect  the  outcome  of  ARR  testing, 
except that beta blocker treatment can cause false-positive results and 
ACE/AT1R inhibitors can cause false-negative results in milder cases 
(Table 386-4).

ARR  screening  is  positive  if  the  ratio  is  >750  pmol/L  per  ng/mL 
per  hour,  with  a  concurrently  high  normal  or  increased  aldoster-
one  (Fig.  386-12).  If  one  relies  on  the  ARR  only,  the  likelihood  of  a 
false-positive ARR becomes greater when renin levels are very low. The 
characteristics of the biochemical assays are also important. Some labs 

measure plasma renin activity, whereas others measure plasma renin 
concentrations. Antibody-based assays for the measurement of serum 
aldosterone lack the reliability of tandem mass spectrometry assays, but 
these are not yet ubiquitously available.

Diagnostic  confirmation  of  mineralocorticoid  excess  in  a  patient 
with a positive ARR screening result should be undertaken by an endo-
crinologist as the tests lack optimized validation. The most straightfor-
ward is the saline infusion test, which involves the IV administration 
of 2 L of physiologic saline over a 4-h period. Failure of aldosterone to 
suppress  <140  pmol/L  (5  ng/dL)  is  indicative  of  autonomous  miner-
alocorticoid excess. Alternative tests are the oral sodium loading test 
(300 mmol NaCl/d for 3 days) or the fludrocortisone suppression test 
(0.1 mg q6h with 30 mmol NaCl q8h for 4 days); the latter can be diffi-
cult because of the risk of profound hypokalemia and increased hyper-
tension.  In  patients  with  overt  hypokalemic  hypertension,  strongly 
positive ARR, and concurrently increased aldosterone levels, confirma-
tory testing is usually not necessary.

Differential  Diagnosis  and  Treatment  After  the  diagnosis  of 
hyperaldosteronism is established, the next step is to use adrenal imag-
ing  to  further  assess  the  cause.  Fine-cut  CT  scanning  of  the  adrenal 
region  is  the  method  of  choice  because  it  provides  excellent  visual-
ization of adrenal morphology and most aldosterone-producing ade-
nomas are <1 cm. CT will readily identify larger tumors suspicious of 
malignancy but may miss lesions <5 mm. The differentiation between 
bilateral  micronodular  hyperplasia  and  a  unilateral  adenoma  is  only 
required if a surgical approach is feasible and desired. Consequently, 
selective  adrenal  vein  sampling  (AVS)  should  only  be  carried  out  in 
surgical  candidates  with  either  no  obvious  lesion  on  CT  or  evidence 
of a unilateral lesion but with age >40 years because the latter patients 
have a high likelihood of harboring a coincidental, endocrine-inactive 
adrenal  adenoma  (Fig.  386-12).  AVS  is  used  to  compare  aldosterone 
levels in the inferior vena cava and between the right and left adrenal

correct  placement  of  the  catheter  in  the  adrenal  veins  and  should 
demonstrate  a  cortisol  gradient  >3  between  the  vena  cava  and  each 
adrenal  vein.  Lateralization  is  confirmed  by  an  aldosterone/cortisol 
ratio that is at least twofold higher on one side than the other. AVS is a

complex procedure that requires a highly skilled interventional radiol-
ogist.  Even  then,  the  right  adrenal  vein  can  be  difficult  to  cannulate 
correctly,  which,  if  not  achieved,  invalidates  the  procedure.  There  is 
also no agreement as to whether the two adrenal veins should be can-
nulated simultaneously or successively and whether ACTH stimulation 
enhances the diagnostic value of AVS.

Patients  <40  years  with  confirmed  mineralocorticoid  excess  and 
a  unilateral  lesion  on  CT  can  go  straight  to  surgery,  which  is  also 
indicated  in  patients  with  confirmed  lateralization  documented  by 
a  valid  AVS  procedure.  Laparoscopic  adrenalectomy  is  the  preferred 
approach. Patients who are not surgical candidates, or with evidence of 
bilateral hyperplasia based on CT or AVS, should be treated medically 
(Fig. 386-12). Medical treatment, which can also be considered prior to 
surgery to avoid postsurgical hypoaldosteronism, consists primarily of 
the MR antagonist spironolactone. It can be started at 12.5–50 mg bid

and titrated up to a maximum of 400 mg/d to control blood pressure 
and normalize potassium. Side effects include menstrual irregularity, 
decreased libido, and gynecomastia. The more selective MR antagonist 
eplerenone can also be used. Doses start at 25 mg bid, and it can be 
titrated  up  to  200  mg/d.  Another  useful  drug  is  the  sodium  channel 
blocker amiloride (5–10 mg bid).

In patients with normal adrenal morphology and family history of 
early-onset,  severe  hypertension,  a  diagnosis  of  GRA  should  be  con-
sidered and can be evaluated using genetic testing. Treatment of GRA 
consists of administering dexamethasone, using the lowest dose possi-
ble to control blood pressure. Some patients also require additional MR 
antagonist treatment.

The diagnosis of non-aldosterone-related mineralocorticoid excess 
is  based  on  documentation  of  suppressed  renin  and  suppressed 
aldosterone in the presence of hypokalemic hypertension. This testing 
is  best  carried  out  by  employing  urinary  steroid  metabolite  profiling 
by  gas  chromatography/mass  spectrometry  (GC/MS).  An  increased 
free cortisol over free cortisone ratio is suggestive of SAME and can be 
treated with dexamethasone. Steroid profiling by GC/MS also detects 
the steroids associated with CYP11B1 and CYP17A1 deficiency or the 
irregular  steroid  secretion  pattern  in  a  DOC-producing  ACC  (Fig. 
386-12).  If  the  GC/MS  profile  is  normal,  Liddle’s  syndrome  should 
be considered. It is very sensitive to amiloride treatment but will not 
respond  to  MR  antagonist  treatment  because  the  defect  is  due  to  a 
constitutively active ENaC.

 ■ APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: INCIDENTALLY 
DISCOVERED ADRENAL MASS
Epidemiology 
Incidentally discovered adrenal masses, commonly 
termed  adrenal  “incidentalomas,”  are  common,  with  a  prevalence  of 
2–5%  in  the  general  population  as  documented  in  CT  and  autopsy 
series. The prevalence increases with age, with 1% of 40-year-olds and 
7% of 70-year-olds harboring an adrenal mass. The widespread use of 
cross-sectional imaging has also increased the recognized prevalence.

Etiology  Most solitary adrenal tumors are monoclonal neoplasms. 
Several genetic syndromes, including MEN 1 (MEN1), MEN 2 (RET), 
Carney’s  complex  (PRKAR1A),  and  McCune-Albright  (GNAS1),  can 
have  adrenal  tumors  as  one  of  their  features.  Somatic  mutations  in 
MEN1,  GNAS1,  and  PRKAR1A  have  been  identified  in  a  small  pro-
portion of sporadic adrenocortical adenomas. Aberrant expression of 
membrane receptors (GIP, α- and β-adrenergic, luteinizing hormone, 
vasopressin  V1,  and  interleukin  1  receptors)  has  been  identified  in 
some sporadic cases of macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia.

The  majority  of  adrenal  nodules  are  endocrine-inactive  adreno-
cortical  adenomas.  However,  larger  series  suggest  that  up  to  25%  of 
adrenal nodules are hormonally active, due to a cortisol- or aldosterone- 
producing adrenocortical adenoma or a pheochromocytoma associated 
with catecholamine excess (Table 386-5). ACC is rare but is the cause 
of an adrenal mass in 5% of patients. However, metastases originating 
from another solid tissue tumor are an additional cause of adrenal inci-
dentaloma and have a higher incidence in patients undergoing imaging 
for tumor staging or follow-up monitoring (Table 386-5).

Differential Diagnosis and Treatment  Patients with an adrenal 
mass >1 cm require a diagnostic evaluation. Two key questions need 
to be addressed: (1) Does the tumor autonomously secrete hormones 
that could have a detrimental effect on health? (2) Is the adrenal mass 
benign or malignant?

Hormone secretion by an adrenal mass occurs along a continuum, 
with  a  gradual  increase  in  clinical  manifestations  in  parallel  with 
hormone levels. Exclusion of catecholamine excess from a pheochro-
mocytoma  arising  from  the  adrenal  medulla  is  a  mandatory  part 
of  the  diagnostic  workup  (Fig.  386-13).  Furthermore,  autonomous 
cortisol  resulting  in  Cushing’s  syndrome  requires  exclusion  and,  in 
patients  with  hypertension  or  low  serum  potassium,  also  primary 
aldosteronism. Adrenal incidentalomas can be associated with MACE, 
and  patients  usually  lack  overt  clinical  features  of  Cushing’s  syn-
drome. Nonetheless, they may exhibit one or more components of the

syndrome), granuloma, amyloidosis, or infiltrative disease including tuberculosis.

metabolic  syndrome  (e.g.,  obesity,  type  2  diabetes,  or  hypertension). 
There is ongoing debate about the optimal treatment for these patients. 
Overproduction of adrenal androgen precursors, DHEA and its sulfate, 
is rare and most frequently seen in the context of ACC, as are increased 
levels of steroid precursors such as 17OHP.

For  the  differentiation  of  benign  from  malignant  adrenal  masses, 
imaging  is  relatively  sensitive,  although  specificity  is  suboptimal. 
Unenhanced  CT  is  the  procedure  of  choice  for  imaging  the  adrenal 
glands  (Fig.  386-11).  A  diagnosis  of  ACC,  pheochromocytoma,  and 
benign  adrenal  myelolipoma  becomes  more  likely  with  increasing 
diameter of the adrenal mass. However, size alone is of poor predictive 
value, with only 80% specificity for the differentiation of benign from 
malignant  masses  when  using  a  4-cm  cutoff.  Metastases  are  rare  but 
are  found  with  similar  frequency  in  adrenal  masses  of  all  sizes.  The 
tumor attenuation value on unenhanced CT is of high diagnostic value, 
as many adrenocortical adenomas are lipid rich and thus present with 
low attenuation values (i.e., densities of <20 Hounsfield units [HUs]). 
However, similar numbers of adrenocortical adenomas are lipid poor 
and present with higher HUs, making it difficult to differentiate them 
from ACCs, as well as also pheochromocytomas, both of which invari-
ably  have  high  attenuation  values  (i.e.,  densities  >20  HU  on  precon-
trast scans). Generally, benign lesions are rounded and homogenous, 
whereas most malignant lesions appear lobulated and inhomogeneous. 
Pheochromocytoma  and  adrenomyelolipoma  may  also  exhibit  lobu-
lated and inhomogeneous features. MRI also allows for the visualiza-
tion  of  the  adrenal  glands  with  somewhat  lower  resolution  than  CT. 
However,  because  it  does  not  involve  exposure  to  ionizing  radiation, 
it is preferred in children, young adults, and during pregnancy. MRI 
has  a  valuable  role  in  the  characterization  of  indeterminate  adrenal 
lesions  using  chemical  shift  analysis,  with  malignant  tumors  rarely 
showing loss of signal on opposed-phase MRI; however, this may also 
be observed in a proportion of benign adrenocortical adenomas.

Fine-needle  aspiration  (FNA)  or  CT-guided  biopsy  of  an  adrenal 
mass is very rarely indicated. FNA of a pheochromocytoma can cause 
a  life-threatening  hypertensive  crisis.  FNA  of  an  ACC  violates  the 
tumor  capsule  and  can  cause  needle  track  metastasis.  FNA  should 
only  be  considered  in  a  patient  with  a  history  of  nonadrenal  malig-
nancy  and  a  newly  detected  adrenal  mass,  after  careful  exclusion  of

pheochromocytoma,  and  if  the  outcome  will  influence  therapeutic 
management. It is important to recognize that in 25% of patients with 
a  previous  history  of  nonadrenal  malignancy,  a  newly  detected  mass 
on  CT  is  not  a  metastasis.  While  FNA  can  diagnose  extra-adrenal 
malignancies, it has very limited ability to differentiate between benign 
and malignant adrenocortical lesions and hence should not be used for 
diagnosis of ACC.

Adrenal masses associated with confirmed hormone excess or sus-
pected  malignancy  are  usually  treated  surgically  (Fig.  386-13)  or,  if 
adrenalectomy is not feasible or desired, with medication. Preoperative 
exclusion of glucocorticoid excess is particularly important for the pre-
diction of postoperative suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland, 
which  requires  glucocorticoid  replacement  peri-  and  postoperatively. 
Adrenal masses with normal endocrine biochemistry at diagnosis and 
a tumor radiodensity of <20 HU on unenhanced CT can be considered 
benign and do not require further follow-up. In adrenal masses with 
suspicious  imaging  findings  (>20  HU),  further  tests  and  surgery  are 
feasible  options  (Fig.  386-13);  however,  the  latter  will  still  result  in 
unnecessary  surgery  for  benign  tumors.  A  recently  introduced  diag-
nostic test, urine steroid metabolomics, has a twofold higher positive 
predictive value than imaging in detecting adrenocortical carcinoma, 
based on a distinct “steroid fingerprint” with accumulating precursor 
steroids in 24-h urine.

 ■ ADRENOCORTICAL CARCINOMA
ACC is a rare malignancy with an annual incidence of 1–2 per million 
population.  ACC  is  generally  considered  a  highly  malignant  tumor; 
however, it presents with broad interindividual variability with regard 
to  biologic  characteristics  and  clinical  behavior.  Somatic  mutations 
in  the  tumor-suppressor  gene  TP53  are  found  in  25%  of  apparently 
sporadic  ACC.  Germline  TP53  mutations  are  the  cause  of  the  Li- 
Fraumeni  syndrome  associated  with  multiple  solid  organ  cancers 
including ACC and are found in 25% of pediatric ACC cases; the TP53 
mutation R337H is found in almost all pediatric ACC in Brazil. Other 
genetic  changes  identified  in  ACC  include  alterations  in  the  Wnt/β-
catenin pathway and in the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) cluster; 
IGF2 overexpression is found in 90% of ACCs.

Patients with large adrenal tumors suspicious of malignancy should 
be  managed  by  a  multidisciplinary  specialist  team,  including  an 
endocrinologist,  an  oncologist,  a  surgeon,  a  radiologist,  and  a  histo-
pathologist.  FNA  is  not  indicated  in  suspected  ACC:  first,  cytology 
and also histopathology of a core biopsy cannot differentiate between 
benign and malignant primary adrenal masses; second, FNA violates 
the tumor capsule and may even cause needle canal metastasis. Even 
when the entire tumor specimen is available, the histopathologic dif-
ferentiation between benign and malignant adrenocortical lesions is a 
diagnostic challenge. The most common histopathologic classification

is  the  Weiss  score,  taking  into  account  high  nuclear  grade;  mitotic 
rate (>5/HPF); atypical mitosis; <25% clear cells; diffuse architecture; 
and presence of necrosis, venous invasion, and invasion of sinusoidal 
structures and tumor capsule. The presence of three or more elements 
suggests ACC. However, FNA is a feasible option if looking for metas-
tases of an extra-adrenal primary or other adrenal tumor entities, such 
as ganglioneuroma.

Although  60–70%  of  ACCs  show  biochemical  evidence  of  steroid 
overproduction, in many patients, this is not clinically apparent due to 
the relatively inefficient steroid production by the adrenocortical can-
cer cells. Excess production of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgen 
precursors are most common and indicative of malignancy.

Tumor staging at ACC diagnosis (Table 386-6) has important prog-
nostic implications and requires scanning of the chest and abdomen for 
local  organ  invasion,  lymphadenopathy,  and  metastases.  Intravenous 
contrast  medium  is  necessary  for  maximum  sensitivity  for  hepatic 
metastases. An adrenal origin may be difficult to determine on stan-
dard  axial  CT  imaging  if  the  tumors  are  large  and  invasive,  but  CT 
reconstructions  and  MRI  are  more  informative  (Fig.  386-14)  using 
multiple planes and different sequences. Vascular and adjacent organ 
invasion  is  diagnostic  of  malignancy.  18-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose 
positron  emission  tomography  (18-FDG-PET)  is  highly  sensitive  for

the detection of malignancy and can be used to detect small metastases 
or local recurrence that may not be obvious on CT (Fig. 386-14). How-
ever, FDG-PET has limited specificity and therefore cannot be used for 
differentiating  benign  from  malignant  adrenal  lesions.  Metastasis  in 
ACC most frequently occurs to liver and lung.

There  is  no  established  grading  system  for  ACC,  and  the  Weiss 
score carries no prognostic value; the most important prognostic his-
topathologic parameter is the Ki67 proliferation index, with Ki67 <10% 
indicative of slow to moderate growth velocity, whereas a Ki67 ≥10% is 
associated with poor prognosis including high risk of recurrence and 
rapid progression.

Cure of ACC can only be achieved by early detection and complete 
surgical removal. Capsule violation during primary surgery, metastasis 
at diagnosis, and primary treatment in a nonspecialist center and by a 
nonspecialist surgeon are major determinants of poor survival. If the 
primary  tumor  invades  adjacent  organs,  en  bloc  removal  of  kidney 
and spleen should be considered to reduce the risk of recurrence, and 
regional lymph node dissection may further reduce this risk. Surgery 
can  also  be  considered  in  a  patient  with  metastases  if  there  is  severe 
tumor-related  hormone  excess.  This  indication  needs  to  be  carefully 
weighed  against  surgical  risk,  including  thromboembolic  complica-
tions, and the resulting delay in the introduction of other therapeutic 
options.  Patients  with  confirmed  ACC  and  successful  removal  of 
the  primary  tumor  should  receive  adjuvant  treatment  with  mitotane 
(o,p’DDD),  particularly  in  patients  with  a  high  risk  of  recurrence  as 
determined  by  tumor  size  >8  cm,  histopathologic  signs  of  vascular 
invasion, capsule invasion or violation, and a Ki67 proliferation index 
≥10%.  Adjuvant  mitotane  should  be  continued  for  at  least  2  years, 
if  side  effects  are  tolerated.  Regular  monitoring  of  plasma  mitotane 
levels is mandatory (therapeutic range 14–20 mg/L; neurotoxic com-
plications more frequent at >20 mg/L). Mitotane is usually started at 
500  mg  tid,  with  stepwise  increases  to  a  maximum  dose  of  2000  mg 
tid  in  days  (high-dose  saturation)  or  weeks  (low-dose  saturation)  as 
tolerated. Once therapeutic range plasma mitotane levels are achieved, 
the  dose  can  be  tapered  to  maintenance  doses  mostly  ranging  from 
1000–1500 mg tid. Mitotane treatment results in disruption of cortisol 
synthesis and thus requires glucocorticoid replacement; glucocorticoid 
replacement  dose  should  be  at  least  double  of  that  usually  used  in 
adrenal insufficiency (i.e., 20 mg tid) because mitotane induces hepatic 
CYP3A4  activity,  resulting  in  rapid  inactivation  of  glucocorticoids. 
Mitotane also increases circulating CBG, thereby decreasing the avail-
able free cortisol fraction. Single metastases can be addressed surgically 
or with radiofrequency ablation as appropriate. If the tumor recurs or 
progresses during mitotane treatment, cytotoxic chemotherapy should 
be considered; the established first-line chemotherapy regimen is the

 ■ ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY
Epidemiology  The  prevalence  of  well-documented,  permanent 
adrenal insufficiency is 5 in 10,000 in the general population. Hypo-
thalamic-pituitary origin of disease is most frequent, with a prevalence 
of 3 in 10,000, whereas primary adrenal insufficiency has a prevalence 
of 2 in 10,000. Approximately one-half of the latter cases are acquired, 
mostly  caused  by  autoimmune  destruction  of  the  adrenal  glands; 
the  other  one-half  are  genetic,  most  commonly  caused  by  distinct 
enzymatic  blocks  in  adrenal  steroidogenesis  affecting  glucocorticoid 
synthesis (i.e., CAH).

Adrenal  insufficiency  arising  from  suppression  of  the  HPA  axis 
as  a  consequence  of  exogenous  glucocorticoid  treatment  is  much 
more  common,  occurring  in  0.5–2%  of  the  population  in  developed 
countries.

Etiology  Primary adrenal insufficiency is most commonly caused by 
autoimmune adrenalitis. Isolated autoimmune adrenalitis accounts for 
30–40%, whereas 60–70% develop adrenal insufficiency as part of auto-
immune  polyglandular  syndromes  (APSs)  (Chap.  388) (Table  386-7). 

APS1,  also  termed  APECED  (autoimmune  polyendocrinopathy- 
candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy), is the underlying cause in 10% of 
patients affected by APS. APS1 is transmitted in an autosomal recessive 
manner and is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator gene 
AIRE. Associated autoimmune conditions overlap with those seen in 
APS2 but may also include total alopecia, primary hypoparathyroidism, 
and, in rare cases, lymphoma. APS1 patients invariably develop chronic 
mucocutaneous  candidiasis,  usually  manifested  in  childhood  and 
preceding  adrenal  insufficiency  by  years  or  decades.  The  much  more 
prevalent APS2 is of polygenic inheritance, with confirmed associations 
with the HLA-DR3 gene region in the major histocompatibility complex 
and  distinct  gene  regions  involved  in  immune  regulation  (CTLA-4, 
PTPN22, CLEC16A). Coincident autoimmune disease most frequently 
includes thyroid autoimmune disease, vitiligo, and premature ovarian 
failure. Less commonly, additional features may include type 1 diabetes 
and pernicious anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy has an incidence of 1:20,000 males 
and  is  caused  by  mutations  in  the  X-ALD  gene  encoding  the  perox-
isomal  membrane  transporter  protein  ABCD1;  its  disruption  results 
in  accumulation  of  very-long-chain  (>24  carbon  atoms)  fatty  acids. 
Approximately 50% of cases manifest in early childhood with rapidly 
progressive  white  matter  disease  (cerebral  adrenoleukodystrophy); 
35%  present  during  adolescence  or  in  early  adulthood  with  neuro-

involvement  (adrenomyeloneuropathy  [AMN]).  In  the  remaining 
15%, adrenal insufficiency is the sole manifestation of disease. Of note, 
distinct mutations manifest with variable penetrance and phenotypes 
within affected families.

Rarer causes of adrenal insufficiency involve destruction of the adre-
nal  glands  as  a  consequence  of  infection,  hemorrhage,  or  infiltration 
(Table 386-7); tuberculous adrenalitis is still a frequent cause of disease 
in developing countries. Adrenal metastases rarely cause adrenal insuf-
ficiency, and this occurs only with bilateral, bulky metastases.

Inborn  causes  of  primary  adrenal  insufficiency  other  than  CAH 
are  rare,  causing  <1%  of  cases.  However,  their  elucidation  provides 
important  insights  into  adrenal  gland  development  and  physiology. 
Mutations causing primary adrenal insufficiency (Table 386-7) include 
factors  regulating  adrenal  development  and  steroidogenesis  (DAX-1, 
SF-1),  cholesterol  synthesis,  import  and  cleavage  (DHCR7,  StAR, 
CYP11A1), elements of the adrenal ACTH response pathway (MC2R, 
MRAP) (Fig. 386-5), and factors involved in redox regulation (NNT, 
TXNRD2) and DNA repair (MCM4, CDKN1C).

Secondary  (or  central)  adrenal  insufficiency  is  the  consequence  of 
dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary component of the HPA axis 
(Table  386-8).  Excluding  iatrogenic  suppression,  the  overwhelming 
majority  of  cases  are  caused  by  pituitary  or  hypothalamic  tumors  or 
their  treatment  by  surgery  or  irradiation  (Chap.  380).  Rarer  causes 
include  pituitary  apoplexy,  either  as  a  consequence  of  an  infarcted 
pituitary  adenoma  or  transient  reduction  in  the  blood  supply  of  the 
pituitary  during  surgery  or  after  rapid  blood  loss  associated  with 
parturition,  also  termed  Sheehan’s  syndrome.  Isolated  ACTH  defi-
ciency is rarely caused by autoimmune disease or pituitary infiltration 
(Table 386-8). Mutations in the ACTH precursor POMC or in factors 
regulating  pituitary  development  are  genetic  causes  of  ACTH  defi-
ciency (Table 386-8).

Clinical Manifestations 
In principle, the clinical features of primary 
adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) are characterized by the loss of 
both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion (Table 386-9). In 
secondary adrenal insufficiency, only glucocorticoid deficiency is pres-
ent, as the adrenal itself is intact and thus still amenable to regulation 
by  the  RAA  system.  Adrenal  androgen  secretion  is  disrupted  in  both 
primary  and  secondary  adrenal  insufficiency  (Table  386-9).  Hypotha-
lamic-pituitary disease can lead to additional clinical manifestations due 
to involvement of other endocrine axes (thyroid, gonads, GH, prolactin) 
or visual impairment with bitemporal hemianopia caused by chiasmal 
compression. It is important to recognize that iatrogenic adrenal insuffi-
ciency caused by exogenous glucocorticoid suppression of the HPA axis 
may  result  in  all  symptoms  associated  with  glucocorticoid  deficiency 
(Table 386-9), if exogenous glucocorticoids are stopped abruptly. How-
ever, patients will appear clinically cushingoid as a result of the preceding 
overexposure to glucocorticoids.

Chronic  adrenal  insufficiency  manifests  with  relatively  nonspecific 
signs and symptoms, such as fatigue and loss of energy, often resulting 
in  delayed  or  missed  diagnoses  (e.g.,  as  depression  or  anorexia).  A 
distinguishing  feature  of  primary  adrenal  insufficiency  is  hyperpig-
mentation,  which  is  caused  by  excess  ACTH  stimulation  of  melano-
cytes.  Hyperpigmentation  is  most  pronounced  in  skin  areas  exposed 
to  increased  friction  or  shear  stress  and  is  increased  by  sunlight 
(Fig. 386-15). Conversely, in secondary adrenal insufficiency, the skin 
has an alabaster-like paleness due to lack of ACTH secretion.

Hyponatremia  is  a  characteristic  biochemical  feature  in  primary 
adrenal  insufficiency  and  is  found  in  80%  of  patients  at  presenta-
tion.  Hyperkalemia  is  present  in  40%  of  patients  at  initial  diagnosis. 
Hyponatremia is primarily caused by mineralocorticoid deficiency but 
can  also  occur  in  secondary  adrenal  insufficiency  due  to  diminished 
inhibition of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release by cortisol, resulting 
in mild syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone 
(SIADH).  Glucocorticoid  deficiency  also  results  in  slightly  increased 
TSH concentrations that normalize within days to weeks after initia-
tion of glucocorticoid replacement.

Acute adrenal insufficiency, also termed adrenal crisis, usually occurs 
after  a  prolonged  period  of  nonspecific  complaints  and  is  more

frequently  observed  in  patients  with  primary  adrenal  insufficiency, 
due to the loss of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion. 
Postural  hypotension  may  progress  to  hypovolemic  shock.  Adrenal 
insufficiency  may  mimic  features  of  acute  abdomen  with  abdominal 
tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and fever. In some cases, the primary pre-
sentation may resemble neurologic disease, with decreased responsive-
ness progressing to stupor and coma. An adrenal crisis can be triggered 
by an intercurrent illness, surgical or other stress, or increased glucocor-
ticoid inactivation (e.g., hyperthyroidism). Prospective data indicate 8.3 
adrenal crises and 0.5 adrenal crisis-related deaths per 100 patient-years.
Diagnosis  The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is established by 
the short cosyntropin test, a safe and reliable tool with excellent pre-
dictive diagnostic value (Fig. 386-16). The cutoff for failure is usually 
defined at cortisol levels of <450–500 nmol/L (16–18 μg/dL) sampled 
30–60 min after ACTH stimulation; the exact cutoff is dependent on 
the locally available assay, with generally lower cutoffs for mass spec-
trometry–based assays. During the early phase of HPA disruption (e.g., 
within  4  weeks  of  pituitary  insufficiency),  patients  may  still  respond 
to exogenous ACTH stimulation. In this circumstance, the ITT is an

alternative choice but is more invasive and should be carried out only 
under a specialist’s supervision (see above). Induction of hypoglycemia 
is contraindicated in individuals with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular 
disease, or history of seizures. Random serum cortisol measurements 
are of limited diagnostic value because baseline cortisol levels may be 
coincidentally  low  due  to  the  physiologic  diurnal  rhythm  of  cortisol 
secretion (Fig. 386-3). Similarly, many patients with secondary adrenal 
insufficiency have relatively normal baseline cortisol levels but fail to 
mount an appropriate cortisol response to ACTH, which can only be 
revealed by stimulation testing. Importantly, tests to establish the diag-
nosis of adrenal insufficiency should never delay treatment. Thus, in a 
patient with suspected adrenal crisis, it is reasonable to draw baseline 
cortisol levels, provide replacement therapy, and defer formal stimula-
tion testing until a later time.

Once  adrenal  insufficiency  is  confirmed,  measurement  of  plasma 
ACTH  is  the  next  step,  with  increased  or  inappropriately  low  lev-
els  defining  primary  and  secondary  origin  of  disease,  respectively 
(Fig.  386-16).  In  primary  adrenal  insufficiency,  increased  plasma 
renin  will  confirm  the  presence  of  mineralocorticoid  deficiency. 
At  initial  presentation,  patients  with  primary  adrenal  insufficiency 
should  undergo  screening  for  steroid  autoantibodies  as  a  marker  of 
autoimmune  adrenalitis.  If  these  tests  are  negative,  adrenal  imaging 
by CT is indicated to investigate possible hemorrhage, infiltration, or 
masses.  In  male  patients  with  negative  autoantibodies  in  the  plasma, 
very-long-chain  fatty  acids  should  be  measured  to  exclude  X-ALD. 
Patients with inappropriately low ACTH, in the presence of confirmed 
cortisol  deficiency,  should  undergo  hypothalamic-pituitary  imaging 
by  MRI.  Features  suggestive  of  preceding  pituitary  apoplexy,  such  as 
sudden-onset  severe  headache  or  history  of  previous  head  trauma, 
should be carefully explored, particularly in patients with no obvious 
MRI lesion.

TREATMENT
Acute Adrenal Insufficiency

Acute  adrenal  insufficiency  requires  immediate  initiation  of  rehy-
dration, usually carried out by saline infusion at initial rates of 1 L/h 
with  continuous  cardiac  monitoring.  Glucocorticoid  replacement 
should  be  initiated  by  bolus  injection  of  100  mg  hydrocortisone, 
followed by the administration of 200 mg hydrocortisone over 24 h, 
preferably by continuous infusion or alternatively by bolus IV or IM 
injections. Mineralocorticoid replacement can be initiated once the 
daily hydrocortisone dose has been reduced to <50 mg because at 
higher doses hydrocortisone provides sufficient stimulation of MRs.
Glucocorticoid replacement for the treatment of chronic adre-
nal insufficiency should be administered at a dose that replaces the 
physiologic daily cortisol production, which is usually achieved by 
the oral administration of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone in two to three 
divided  doses.  Pregnancy  may  require  an  increase  in  hydrocorti-
sone dose by 50% during the last trimester. In all patients, at least 
one-half of the daily dose should be administered in the morning. 
Currently  available  glucocorticoid  preparations  fail  to  mimic  the 
physiologic  cortisol  secretion  rhythm  (Fig.  386-3).  Long-acting 
glucocorticoids  such  as  prednisolone  or  dexamethasone  are  not 
preferred because they result in increased glucocorticoid exposure 
due to extended GR activation at times of physiologically low corti-
sol secretion. There are no well-established dose equivalencies, but 
as a guide, equipotency can be assumed for 1 mg hydrocortisone, 
1.6 mg cortisone acetate, 0.2 mg prednisolone, 0.25 mg prednisone, 
and 0.025 mg dexamethasone.

Monitoring  of  glucocorticoid  replacement  is  mainly  based  on 
the history and examination for signs and symptoms suggestive of 
glucocorticoid over- or underreplacement, including assessment of 
body weight and blood pressure. Plasma ACTH, 24-h urinary free 
cortisol,  or  serum  cortisol  day  curves  reflect  whether  hydrocorti-
sone has been taken or not but do not convey reliable information 
about replacement quality. In patients with isolated primary adrenal 
insufficiency, monitoring should include screening for autoimmune 
thyroid disease, and female patients should be made aware of the 
possibility  of  premature  ovarian  failure.  Supraphysiologic  gluco-
corticoid treatment with doses equivalent to 30 mg hydrocortisone 
or  more  will  affect  bone  metabolism,  and  these  patients  should 
undergo regular bone mineral density evaluation. All patients with 
adrenal insufficiency need to be instructed about the requirement 
for stress-related glucocorticoid dose adjustments. These generally 
consist of doubling the routine oral glucocorticoid dose in the case 
of  intercurrent  illness  with  fever  and  bed  rest  and  the  need  for 
immediate IV or IM injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone followed 
by intravenous infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone/24 h in cases of 
prolonged vomiting, surgery, or trauma. All patients, but in partic-
ular those living or traveling in regions with delayed access to acute 
health care, should carry a hydrocortisone self-injection emergency 
kit, in addition to their usual steroid emergency cards and bracelets, 
and should receive training in its use.

Mineralocorticoid  replacement  in  primary  adrenal  insuffi-
ciency should be initiated at a dose of 100–150 μg fludrocortisone. 
The  adequacy  of  treatment  can  be  evaluated  by  measuring  blood 
pressure, sitting and standing, to detect a postural drop indicative 
of hypovolemia. In addition, serum sodium, potassium, and plasma 
renin should be measured regularly. Renin levels should be kept in 
the upper normal reference range. Changes in glucocorticoid dose 
may also impact on mineralocorticoid replacement as cortisol also 
binds the MR; 40 mg of hydrocortisone is equivalent to 100 μg of 
fludrocortisone. It is important to note that prednisone and pred-
nisolone have reduced mineralocorticoid activity and dexametha-
sone has none. In patients living or traveling in areas with hot or 
tropical  weather  conditions,  the  fludrocortisone  dose  should  be 
increased by 50–100 μg during the summer. Mineralocorticoid dose 
may also need to be adjusted during pregnancy due to the antimin-
eralocorticoid activity of progesterone, but this is less often required

than hydrocortisone dose adjustment. Plasma renin cannot serve as 
a monitoring tool during pregnancy because renin rises physiolog-
ically during gestation.

Adrenal  androgen  replacement  is  an  option  in  patients  with 
lack of energy, despite optimized glucocorticoid and mineralocorti-
coid replacement. It may also be indicated in women with features 
of  androgen  deficiency,  including  loss  of  libido.  Adrenal  andro-
gen  replacement  can  be  achieved  by  once-daily  administration 
of  25–50  mg  DHEA.  Treatment  is  monitored  by  measurement  of 
DHEAS, androstenedione, testosterone, and sex hormone–binding 
globulin (SHBG) 24 h after the last DHEA dose.

 ■ CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA
(See also Chap. 390) CAH is caused by mutations in genes encoding 
steroidogenic enzymes involved in glucocorticoid synthesis (CYP21A2, 
CYP17A1, HSD3B2, CYP11B1) or in the cofactor enzyme P450 oxidore-
ductase  that  serves  as  an  electron  donor  to  CYP21A2  and  CYP17A1 
(Fig.  386-1).  Invariably,  patients  affected  by  CAH  exhibit  glucocorti-
coid deficiency. Depending on the exact step of enzymatic block, they 
may  also  have  excess  production  of  mineralocorticoids  or  deficient 
production  of  sex  steroids  (Table  386-10).  The  diagnosis  of  CAH  is 
readily established by measurement of the steroids accumulating before 
the distinct enzymatic block, either in serum or in urine, preferably by 
the use of mass spectrometry–based assays (Table 386-10).

Mutations  in  CYP21A2  are  the  most  prevalent  cause  of  CAH, 
responsible  for  90–95%  of  cases.  21-Hydroxylase  deficiency  disrupts 
glucocorticoid  and  mineralocorticoid  synthesis  (Fig.  386-1),  result-
ing  in  diminished  negative  feedback  via  the  HPA  axis.  This  leads  to 
increased  pituitary  ACTH  release,  which  drives  increased  synthesis 
of  adrenal  androgen  precursors  and  subsequent  androgen  excess. 
The  degree  of  impairment  of  glucocorticoid  and  mineralocorticoid 
secretion depends on the severity of mutations. Major loss-of-function 
mutations  result  in  combined  glucocorticoid  and  mineralocorticoid 
deficiency  (classic  CAH,  neonatal  presentation),  whereas  less  severe 
mutations affect glucocorticoid synthesis only (simple virilizing CAH, 
neonatal  or  early  childhood  presentation).  The  mildest  mutations 
result in the least severe clinical phenotype, nonclassic CAH, usually 
presenting during adolescence and early adulthood and with preserved 
glucocorticoid production.

Androgen  excess  is  present  in  all  patients  and  manifests  with  broad 
phenotypic  variability,  ranging  from  severe  virilization  of  the  external 
genitalia in neonatal girls (e.g., 46,XX disordered sex development [DSD]) 
to hirsutism and oligomenorrhea resembling a polycystic ovary syndrome 
phenotype in young women with nonclassic CAH. In countries without 
neonatal screening for CAH, boys with classic CAH usually present with 
life-threatening adrenal crisis in the first few weeks of life (salt-wasting 
crisis);  a  simple-virilizing  genotype  manifests  with  precocious  pseudo-
puberty  and  advanced  bone  age  in  early  childhood,  whereas  men  with 
nonclassic CAH are usually detected only through family screening.

Glucocorticoid treatment is more complex than for other causes of 
primary adrenal insufficiency as it not only needed to replace missing 
glucocorticoids  but  also  to  control  the  increased  ACTH  drive  and 
subsequent  androgen  excess.  Current  treatment  is  hampered  by  the 
lack  of  glucocorticoid  preparations  that  mimic  the  diurnal  cortisol 
secretion profile, resulting in a prolonged period of ACTH stimulation 
and subsequent androgen production during the early morning hours. 
In  childhood,  optimization  of  growth  and  pubertal  development  are 
important goals of glucocorticoid treatment, in addition to prevention 
of adrenal crisis and treatment of 46,XX DSD. In adults, the focus shifts 
to  preserving  fertility  and  preventing  side  effects  of  glucocorticoid 
overtreatment,  namely,  the  metabolic  syndrome  and  osteoporosis. 
Fertility can be compromised in women due to oligomenorrhea/amen-
orrhea with chronic anovulation as a consequence of androgen excess. 
Men may develop testicular adrenal rest tissue (TART) (Fig. 386-17) 
consisting of hyperplastic cells with shared adrenal and gonadal char-
acteristics  located  in  the  rete  testis,  which  should  not  be  confused 
with testicular tumors. TART can compromise sperm production and 
induce testicular fibrosis that may be irreversible.

TREATMENT
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

Hydrocortisone  is  a  good  treatment  option  for  the  prevention  of 
adrenal  crisis,  but  longer  acting  prednisolone  may  be  needed  to 
control  androgen  excess.  In  children,  hydrocortisone  is  given  in 
divided  doses  at  1–1.5  times  the  normal  cortisol  production  rate 
(~10–13 mg/m2 per day). In adults, if hydrocortisone does not suf-
fice, intermediate-acting glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) may be 
given, using the lowest dose necessary to suppress excess androgen 
production. For achieving fertility, dexamethasone treatment may 
be required but should only be given for the shortest possible time 
period to limit adverse metabolic side effects. The recent introduc-
tion of modified and delayed-release hydrocortisone, which mimics 
the  endogenous  physiologic  cortisol  release  pattern,  is  promising, 

providing  effective  control  of  steroid  precursor  excess  while  the 
daily hydrocortisone dose is lower than required for immediate- 
release hydrocortisone.

Biochemical  monitoring  should  include  androstenedione  and 
testosterone,  aiming  for  the  normal  sex-specific  reference  range. 
17OHP  is  a  useful  marker  of  overtreatment,  indicated  by  17OHP 
levels within the normal range of healthy controls. Glucocorticoid 
overtreatment  may  suppress  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
axis. Thus, treatment needs to be carefully titrated against clinical 
features  of  disease  control.  Stress-dose  glucocorticoids  should  be 
given at double or triple the daily dose for surgery, acute illness, or 
severe trauma. Poorly controlled CAH can result in adrenocortical 
hyperplasia,  which  gave  the  disease  its  name,  and  may  present 
as  macronodular  hyperplasia  subsequent  to  long-standing  ACTH 
excess  (Fig.  386-17).  The  nodular  areas  can  develop  autonomous 
adrenal  androgen  production  and  may  be  unresponsive  to  glu-
cocorticoid  treatment.  The  prevalence  of  adrenomyelolipomas  is 
increased in CAH; these are benign but can require surgical inter-
vention due to lack of self-limiting growth.

Mineralocorticoid requirements change during life and are higher 
in children, explained by relative mineralocorticoid resistance that 
diminishes with ongoing maturation of the kidney. Children with 
CAH usually receive mineralocorticoid and salt replacement. How-
ever, young adults with CAH should undergo reassessment of their 
mineralocorticoid reserve. Plasma renin should be regularly moni-
tored and kept within the upper half of the normal reference range.

387 Pheochromocytoma

Hartmut P. H. Neumann

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are catecholamine-producing 
tumors  derived  from  the  sympathetic  or  parasympathetic  nervous 
system. These tumors may arise sporadically or be inherited as features 
of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), von Hippel–Lindau 
(VHL)  disease,  or  several  other  pheochromocytoma-associated  syn-
dromes. The diagnosis of pheochromocytomas identifies a potentially 
correctable  cause  of  hypertension,  and  their  removal  can  prevent 
hypertensive crises that can be lethal. The clinical presentation is vari-
able,  ranging  from  an  adrenal  incidentaloma  to  a  hypertensive  crisis 
with associated cerebrovascular or cardiac complications.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Pheochromocytoma is estimated to occur in 2–8 of 1 million persons 
per  year,  and  ~0.1%  of  hypertensive  patients  harbor  a  pheochromo-
cytoma. The mean age at diagnosis is ~40 years, although the tumors 
can occur from early childhood until late in life. The classic “rule of 
tens” for pheochromocytomas states that ~10% are bilateral, 10% are 
extra-adrenal, and 10% are metastatic.

 ■ ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Pheochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas  are  well-vascularized 
tumors that arise from cells derived from the sympathetic (e.g., adrenal 
medulla or sympathetic trunk) or parasympathetic (e.g., carotid body, 

glomus  tympanicum,  glomus  jugulare,  glomus  vagale)  paraganglia 
(Fig. 387-1). The name pheochromocytoma reflects the formerly used 
black-colored  staining  caused  by  chromaffin  oxidation  of  catechola-
mines;  although  a  variety  of  terms  have  been  used  to  describe  these 
tumors, most clinicians use this designation to describe symptomatic 
catecholamine-producing  tumors,  including  those  in  extra-adrenal 
retroperitoneal, pelvic, and thoracic sites. The term paraganglioma is 
used to describe catecholamine-producing tumors in the skull base and 
neck; these tumors may secrete little or no catecholamine. In contrast 
to common clinical parlance, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
restricts the term pheochromocytoma to adrenal tumors and applies the 
term paraganglioma to tumors at all other sites.

The etiology of sporadic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas 
is  unknown.  However,  25–33%  of  patients  have  an  inherited  condi-
tion,  including  germline  mutations  in  the  classically  recognized  RET 
(rearranged  during  transfection),  VHL,  NF1  (neurofibromatosis  type 
1), SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD (subunits of SDH) genes or in the more 
recently recognized SDHA, SDHAF2, TMEM127 (transmembrane pro-
tein  127),  MAX  (myc-associated  factor  X),  FH  (fumarate  hydratase), 
PDH1, PDH2 (pyruvate dehydrogenase), HIF1α and HIF2α (hypoxia- 
inducible  factor),  MDH2  (malate  dehydrogenase),  KIF1Bβ  (kine-
sin  family  member),  IDH1,  (isocitrate  dehydrogenase  1),  SLC25A11  
(oxoglutarate/malate),  H-RAS  (transforming  protein  p21),  and 
DNMTA3 (DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha) genes. Biallelic gene inac-
tivation, a characteristic of tumor-suppressor genes, has been demon-
strated for the VHL, NF1, SDHx, TMEM127, MAX, FH, PDH1, PDH2, 
MDH2, and KIF1Bβ genes. In contrast, RET is a protooncogene, and 
mutations activate receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Succinate dehydro-
genase (SDH) is an enzyme of the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial 
respiratory  chain.  The  VHL  protein  is  a  component  of  a  ubiquitin 
E3  ligase.  VHL  mutations  reduce  protein  degradation,  resulting  in 
upregulation of components involved in cell-cycle progression, glucose 
metabolism,  and  oxygen  sensing.  In  addition  to  germline  mutations, 
somatic mutations have been observed in >20 genes, broadly grouped 
into three different clusters of pathogenetically relevant genes: cluster 
1, the pseudohypoxia group comprising mainly the genes SDHx (sub-
units  of  SDH),  FH,  VHL,  and  HIF2A;  cluster  2,  the  kinase  signaling 
group (RET, NF1, TMEM127, MAX, HRAS, KIF1Bβ, PDH); and cluster 
3, the Wnt signaling group (CSDE1, MAML3).
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Its clinical presentation is so variable that pheochromocytoma has been 
termed “the great masquerader” (Table 387-1). Among the presenting 
manifestations, episodes of palpitation, headache, and profuse sweating 
are typical, and these manifestations constitute a classic triad. The pres-
ence of all three manifestations in association with hypertension makes 
pheochromocytoma a likely diagnosis. However, a pheochromocytoma 
can be asymptomatic for years, and some tumors grow to a consider-
able size before patients note symptoms.

The  dominant  sign  is  hypertension.  Classically,  patients  have 
episodic  hypertension,  but  sustained  hypertension  is  also  common. 
Catecholamine  crises  can  lead  to  heart  failure,  pulmonary  edema, 
arrhythmias,  and  intracranial  hemorrhage.  During  episodes  of  hor-
mone release, which can occur at widely divergent intervals, patients 
are anxious and pale, and they experience tachycardia and palpitations. 
These paroxysms generally last <1 h and may be precipitated by sur-
gery,  positional  changes,  exercise,  pregnancy,  urination  (particularly 
with  bladder  pheochromocytomas),  and  various  medications  (e.g., 
tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, metoclopramide).
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis is based on documentation of catecholamine excess by 
biochemical  testing  and  localization  of  the  tumor  by  imaging.  These 
two  criteria  are  of  equal  importance,  although  measurement  of  cate-
cholamines or metanephrines (their methylated metabolites) is tradi-
tionally the first step in diagnosis.

Biochemical  Testing  Pheochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas 
synthesize  and  store  catecholamines,  which  include  norepinephrine 
(noradrenaline),  epinephrine  (adrenaline),  and  dopamine.  Elevated

plasma and urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines form 
the  cornerstone  of  diagnosis.  The  characteristic  fluctuations  in  the 
hormonal activity of tumors result in considerable variation in serial 
catecholamine  measurements.  However,  most  tumors  continuously 
leak O-methylated metabolites, which are detected by measurement of 
metanephrines.

Catecholamines  and  metanephrines  can  be  measured  by  differ-
ent  methods,  including  high-performance  liquid  chromatography, 
enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay,  and  liquid  chromatography/
mass spectrometry. When pheochromocytoma is suspected on clinical 
grounds (i.e., when values are three times the upper limit of normal), 
this  diagnosis  is  highly  likely  regardless  of  the  assay  used.  How-
ever,  as  summarized  in  Table  387-2,  the  sensitivity  and  specificity 
of  available  biochemical  tests  vary  greatly,  and  these  differences  are 
important in assessing patients with borderline elevations of different 
compounds.  Urinary  tests  for  metanephrines  (total  or  fractionated) 
and  catecholamines  are  widely  available  and  are  used  commonly  for 
initial evaluation. Among these tests, those for the fractionated meta-
nephrines and catecholamines are the most sensitive. Plasma tests are 
more  convenient  and  include  measurements  of  catecholamines  and 
metanephrines.  Measurements  of  plasma  metanephrine  are  the  most 
sensitive and are less susceptible to false-positive elevations from stress, 
including  venipuncture.  Although  the  incidence  of  false-positive  test 
results  has  been  reduced  by  the  introduction  of  newer  assays,  physi-
ologic  stress  responses  and  medications  that  increase  catecholamine 
levels still can confound testing. Because the tumors are relatively rare, 
borderline  elevations  are  likely  to  represent  false-positive  results.  In 
this  circumstance,  it  is  important  to  exclude  dietary  or  drug-related 
factors (withdrawal of levodopa or use of sympathomimetics, diuretics, 
tricyclic  antidepressants,  alpha  and  beta  blockers)  that  might  cause

false-positive results and then to repeat testing or perform a clonidine 
suppression test (i.e., the measurement of plasma normetanephrine 3 h 
after oral administration of 300 μg of clonidine). Other pharmacologic 
tests, such as the phentolamine test and the glucagon provocation test, 
are of relatively low sensitivity and are not recommended.

Diagnostic  Imaging  A  variety  of  methods  have  been  used  to 
localize  pheochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas  (Table  387-2,  
Figs. 387-2, 387-3, and 387-4). CT and MRI are similar in sensitivity 
and should be performed with contrast. T2-weighted MRI with gad-
olinium contrast is optimal for detecting pheochromocytomas and is 
somewhat better than CT for imaging extra-adrenal pheochromocyto-
mas and paragangliomas. About 5% of adrenal incidentalomas, which 
usually are detected by CT or MRI, prove to be pheochromocytomas 
upon  endocrinologic evaluation,  but  the  presence  of  pheochromocy-
tomas is unlikely if unenhanced CT reveals an attenuation of <10 HU.
Tumors also can be localized by procedures using radioactive tracers, 
including  131I- or  123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, 
111In-somatostatin analogue scintigraphy, 18F-DOPA positron emission 
tomography (PET),  68Ga-DOTATATE PET, or  18F-fluorodeoxyglucose

with peripheral glial-like sustentacular cells. How-
ever, a broad spectrum of architectural and cyto-
logic features can be seen. Immunohistochemistry 
is  positive  for  chromogranin  and  synaptophysin 
in  the  chief  cells  and  S-100  in  the  sustentacu-
lar  cells  (Fig.  387-5A-D).  Increasingly,  staining 
with  antibodies  against  the  proteins  encoded  by 
susceptibility  genes  for  hereditary  pheochromo-
cytomas, such as SDHB, is used to histologically 
demonstrate  defects  of  these  proteins,  thereby 
making  germline  mutations  more  likely  (Fig. 
387-5E and F).

Differential  Diagnosis  When  the  possibility 
of  a  pheochromocytoma  is  being  entertained, 
other  disorders  to  consider  include  essential 
hypertension,  anxiety  attacks,  use  of  cocaine  or 
amphetamines,  mastocytosis  or  carcinoid  syn-
drome (usually without hypertension), intracranial 
lesions, clonidine withdrawal, autonomic epilepsy, 
and factitious crises (usually from use of sympath-
omimetic amines). When an asymptomatic adre-
nal mass is identified, likely diagnoses other than 
pheochromocytoma  include  a  nonfunctioning 
adrenal  adenoma,  an  aldosteronoma,  and  a  cor-
tisol-producing adenoma (Cushing’s syndrome).

(FDG) PET (Fig. 387-2B and 387-4A and B). For PET-CT with both 
68Ga-DOTATATE  and  18F-DOPA,  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  are 
very  high  (>95%).  These  agents  are  particularly  useful  in  the  docu-
mentation  of  hereditary  syndromes  but  also  in  metastatic  pheochro-
mocytoma,  because  uptake  is  exhibited  also  in  paragangliomas  and 
metastases.

Pathology  Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are found at 
the classical sites of the adrenal medulla (Fig. 387-2) and paraganglia 
(Fig.  387-3).  Histologically,  the  tumors  often  show  a  characteristic 
“Zellballen” pattern, consisting of nests of neuroendocrine chief cells 

TREATMENT
Pheochromocytoma

Complete  tumor  removal,  the  ultimate  therapeutic  goal,  can  be 
achieved  by  partial  or  total  adrenalectomy.  It  is  important  to 
preserve  the  normal  adrenal  cortex  in  order  to  prevent  Addison’s 
disease,  particularly  in  hereditary  disorders  in  which  bilateral 
pheochromocytomas  are  most  likely.  Preoperative  preparation  of 
the  patient  has  to  be  considered,  and  blood  pressure  should  be 
consistently  <160/90  mmHg.  Classically,  blood  pressure  has  been

controlled  by  α-adrenergic  blockers  (oral  phenoxybenzamine,   
0.5–4  mg/kg  of  body  weight).  Because  patients  are  volume- 
constricted, liberal salt intake and hydration are necessary to avoid 
severe orthostasis. Oral prazosin or intravenous phentolamine can 
be  used  to  manage  paroxysms  while  adequate  alpha  blockade  is 
awaited.  Beta  blockers  (e.g.,  10  mg  of  propranolol  three  or  four 
times per day) can then be added. Other antihypertensives, such as 
calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhib-
itors, have also been used effectively.

Surgery should be performed by teams of surgeons and anesthe-
siologists with experience in the management of pheochromocyto-
mas. Blood pressure can be labile during surgery, particularly at the 
outset of intubation or when the tumor is manipulated. Nitroprus-
side  infusion  is  useful  for  intraoperative  hypertensive  crises,  and 
hypotension  usually  responds  to  volume  infusion.  The  latter  side 
effect  can,  however,  be  avoided  in  normotensive  pheochromocy-
toma patients by having only standby intraoperative nitroprusside, 
which has been shown to be safe and avoids postoperative hypoten-
sion  often  caused  by  alpha  blockers;  the  long-lasting  guideline  for 
obligatory  preoperative  treatment  with  alpha  blockers  is  under   
discussion.

Minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopy or retroperitoneos-
copy) have become the standard approaches in pheochromocytoma 
surgery.  They  are  associated  with  fewer  complications,  a  faster 
recovery,  and  optimal  cosmetic  results.  Extra-adrenal  abdominal 
and most thoracic pheochromocytomas can also be removed endo-
scopically. Postoperatively, catecholamine normalization should be 
documented. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test should 
be used to exclude cortisol deficiency when bilateral adrenal cortex–
sparing surgery has been performed.

Head  and  neck  paragangliomas  are  a  challenge  for  surgeons, 
since  damage  of  adjacent  tissue,  mainly  vessels  or  cranial  nerves, 
is  a  frequent  permanent  side  effect.  Careful  consideration  of  best 

management is important, and radiotherapy may be an alternative, 
especially for large head and neck paragangliomas.

 ■ METASTATIC PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
About 5–10% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are meta-
static. The diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma is problematic. 
The  typical  histologic  criteria  of  cellular  atypia,  presence  of  mitoses, 
and invasion of vessels or adjacent tissues are insufficient for the diag-
nosis of malignancy in pheochromocytoma. Thus, the term malignant 
pheochromocytoma has been replaced by metastatic pheochromocytoma 
as suggested by the WHO and is restricted to tumors with lymph node 
or  distant  metastases,  the  latter  most  commonly  found  by  nuclear 
medicine imaging in lungs, bone, or liver locations suggesting a vas-
cular pathway of spread (Fig. 387-4B). Because hereditary syndromes 
are  associated  with  multifocal  tumor  sites,  these  features  should  be 
anticipated  in  patients  with  germline  mutations,  especially  of  RET, 
VHL, SDHD, or SDHB. However, distant metastases also occur in these 
syndromes, especially in carriers of SDHB mutations.

Treatment  of  metastatic  pheochromocytoma  or  paraganglioma  is 
challenging. Options include tumor mass reduction, alpha blockers for 
symptoms,  chemotherapy,  nuclear  medicine  radiotherapy,  and  stereo-
tactic  radiation.  The  first-line  choice  is  nuclear  medicine  therapy  for 
scintigraphically  documented  metastases,  preferably  with  131I-MIBG  in 
100–300 mCi doses over 3–6 cycles. Other options for radionuclide treat-
ment  are  somatostatin  receptor  ligands,  e.g.,  DOTATOC  labeled  with 
yttrium-90 or lutetium-177, both for palliative outcomes. Averbuch’s che-
motherapy protocol includes dacarbazine (600 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2), 
cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2 on day 1), and vincristine (1.4 mg/m2 
on day 1), all repeated every 21 days for 3–6 cycles. Palliation (stable 
disease to shrinkage) is achieved in about one-half of patients. Due to 
increasing  insights  in  the  genetics  of  pheochromocytoma  and  their 
molecular  pathways,  new  targeted  chemotherapeutic  options  such  as

sunitinib and temozolomide/thalidomide are under development. The 
prognosis of metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma is vari-
able, with 5-year survival rates of 30–60%.

 ■ PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA IN PREGNANCY
Pheochromocytomas  occasionally  are  diagnosed  in  pregnancy  and 
can be very challenging to manage. Endoscopic removal, preferably in 
the fourth to sixth month of gestation, is possible and can be followed 
by uneventful childbirth. Regular screening in families with inherited 
pheochromocytomas provides an opportunity to identify and remove 
such tumors in women of reproductive age.

 ■ PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA-ASSOCIATED 
SYNDROMES
About  25–33%  of  patients  with  a  pheochromocytoma  or  paragan-
glioma have an inherited syndrome. At diagnosis, patients with inher-
ited  syndromes  are  a  mean  of  ~15  years  younger  than  patients  with 
sporadic tumors.

The  best-known  pheochromocytoma-associated  syndrome  is  the 
autosomal  dominant  disorder  MEN  2  (Chap.  388).  Both  types  of 
MEN 2 (2A and 2B) are caused by mutations in RET, which encodes 
a  tyrosine  kinase.  The  locations  of  RET  mutations  correlate  with  the 
severity  of  disease  and  the  type  of  MEN  2  (Chap.  388).  MEN  2A  is 
characterized  by  medullary  thyroid  carcinoma  (MTC),  pheochromo-
cytoma,  and  hyperparathyroidism;  MEN  2B  also  includes  MTC  and 
pheochromocytoma as well as multiple mucosal neuromas, marfanoid 
habitus, and other developmental disorders, although it typically lacks 
hyperparathyroidism. MTC is found in virtually all patients with MEN 
2,  but  pheochromocytoma  occurs  in  only  ~50%  of  these  patients. 
Nearly all pheochromocytomas in MEN 2 are benign and located in the 
adrenals,  often  bilaterally.  Pheochromocytoma  may  be  symptomatic 
before MTC. Prophylactic thyroidectomy is being performed in many 
carriers  of  RET  mutations;  pheochromocytomas  should  be  excluded 
before any surgery in these patients.

VHL is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes to retinal 
and  cerebellar  hemangioblastomas,  which  also  occur  in  the  brain-
stem and spinal cord (Fig. 387-6). Other important features of VHL 
are  clear  cell  renal  carcinomas,  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumors, 

endolymphatic sac tumors of the inner ear, cystadenomas of the epi-
didymis  and  broad  ligament,  and  multiple  pancreatic  or  renal  cysts. 
Although the VHL gene can be inactivated by all types of mutations, 
patients with pheochromocytoma predominantly have missense muta-
tions. About 20–30% of patients with VHL have pheochromocytomas, 
but in some families, the incidence can reach 90%. The recognition of 
pheochromocytoma as a VHL-associated feature provides an opportu-
nity to diagnose retinal, central nervous system, renal, and pancreatic 
tumors at a stage when effective treatment may still be possible.

NF1  was  the  first  described  pheochromocytoma-associated  syn-
drome. The NF1 gene functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating 
the Ras signaling cascade. Classic features of neurofibromatosis include 
multiple neurofibromas, café au lait spots, axillary freckling of the skin, 
and Lisch nodules of the iris. Pheochromocytomas occur in only ~1% 
of these patients and are located predominantly in the adrenals. Meta-
static pheochromocytoma is not uncommon in NF1.

The paraganglioma syndromes (PGLs) have been classified by genetic 
analyses of families with head and neck paragangliomas. The suscepti-
bility genes encode subunits of the enzyme SDH, a component in the 
Krebs  cycle  and  the  mitochondrial  electron  transport  chain.  SDH  is 
formed  by  four  subunits  (A–D).  Mutations  of  SDHA  (PGL5),  SDHB 
(PGL4), SDHC (PGL3), SDHD (PGL1), and SDHAF2 (PGL2) predis-
pose to the PGLs. The transmission of the disease in carriers of SDHA, 
SDHB,  and  SDHC  germline  mutations  is  autosomal  dominant.  In 
contrast, in virtually all SDHD and SDHAF2 families, only the progeny 
of affected fathers develop tumors if they inherit the mutation. PGL1 
is most common, followed by PGL4; PGL2, PGL3, and PGL5 are rare. 
Adrenal, extra-adrenal abdominal, and thoracic pheochromocytomas, 
which are components of PGL1, PGL4, and PGL5, are rare in PGL3 and 
absent in PGL2 (Fig. 387-4A). About one-third of patients with PGL4 
develop  metastases,  which  is  the  highest  rate  in  pheochromocytoma- 
associated syndromes. Other syndromes with metastatic pheochromo-
cytomas are mainly VHL, NF1, and PGL1.

Other  familial  pheochromocytoma  has  been  attributed  to  heredi-
tary, mainly adrenal tumors in patients with germline mutations in the 
genes TMEM127 and MAX. Transmission is also autosomal dominant, 
and mutations of MAX, like those of SDHD, cause tumors only if inher-
ited from the father.

 ■ GENETIC SCREENING OF PATIENTS WITH 
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA OR PARAGANGLIOMA
Effective  preventive  medicine  for  pheochromocytoma  and  pheo-
chromocytoma-associated  diseases  requires  management  according 
to  identified  germline  mutations  in  susceptibility  genes.  In  addition 
to  family  history,  general  features  suggesting  an  inherited  syndrome 

include young age, multifocal tumors, extra-adrenal tumors, and met-
astatic tumors (Table 387-3 and Fig. 387-7). Because of the relatively 
high  prevalence  of  familial  syndromes  among  patients  who  present 
with  pheochromocytoma  or  paraganglioma,  it  is  useful  to  identify 
germline mutations even in patients without a known family history. 
A first step is to search for clinical features of inherited syndromes and

to obtain an in-depth, multigenerational family history. Each of these 
syndromes  exhibits  autosomal  dominant  transmission  with  variable 
penetrance,  but  a  proband  with  a  mother  affected  by  paraganglial 
tumors  is  not  predisposed  to  PLG1  and  PGL2  (SDHD  and  SDHAF2 
mutation  carrier).  Cutaneous  neurofibromas,  café  au  lait  spots,  and 
axillary  freckling  suggest  neurofibromatosis.  Germline  mutations 

in  NF1  have  nearly  never  been  reported  in  patients  with  sporadic 
pheochromocytomas. Thus, NF1 testing is not needed in the absence 
of  other  clinical  features  of  neurofibromatosis.  A  personal  or  family 
history of MTC or an elevation of serum calcitonin strongly suggests 
MEN  2  and  should  prompt  testing  for  RET  mutations.  A  history  of 
visual  impairment  or  tumors  of  the  cerebellum,  brain  stem,  spinal

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismcord  or  the  kidney  suggests  the  possibility  of  VHL.  A  personal  and/
or  family  history  of  head  and  neck  paraganglioma  suggests  PGL1  or  
PGL4.

A single adrenal pheochromocytoma in a patient with an otherwise 
unremarkable history may still be associated with mutations of VHL, 
RET, SDHB, or SDHD (in decreasing order of frequency). Two-thirds 
of  extra-adrenal  tumors  are  associated  with  one  of  these  syndromes, 
and multifocal tumors occur with decreasing frequency in carriers of 
RET, SDHD, VHL, SDHB, and MAX mutations. About 30% of head and 
neck paragangliomas are associated with germline mutations of one of 
the SDH subunit genes (most often SDHD) and are rare in carriers of 
VHL, RET, MAX, and TMEM127 mutations. Immunohistochemistry is 
helpful in the preselection of hereditary pheochromocytoma. Negative 
immunostaining with antibodies to SDHB (Fig. 387-5F), TMEM127, 
and MAX may predict mutations of the SDHx (PGL1-5), TMEM127, 
and MAX genes, respectively.

Whole  genome  sequence  analysis  is  increasingly  replacing  targeted 
Sanger  sequencing.  It  is  now  possible  to  search  for  germline  mutations  in 
a  set  of  genes,  such  that  all  susceptibility  genes  for  pheochromocytoma- 
associated  syndromes  could  be  analyzed  in  one  procedure.  Of  note, 
sequencing protocols may not detect large deletions of one or more exons.
Once the underlying syndrome is diagnosed, the benefit of genetic 
testing  can  be  extended  to  relatives.  For  this  purpose,  it  is  necessary 
to  identify  the  germline  mutation  in  the  proband  and,  after  genetic 
counseling, to perform DNA sequence analyses of the responsible gene 
in relatives to determine whether they are affected. Other family mem-
bers may benefit when individuals who carry a germline mutation are 
biochemically screened for paraganglial tumors.

Asymptomatic paraganglial tumors, now often detected in patients 
with hereditary tumors and their relatives, are challenging to manage. 
Watchful  waiting  strategies  have  been  introduced.  Head  and  neck 
paragangliomas—mainly carotid body, jugular, and vagal tumors—are 
increasingly treated by radiation, since surgery is frequently associated 
with permanent palsy of cranial nerves II, VII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Nev-
ertheless, tympanic paragangliomas are symptomatic early, and most of 
these tumors can easily be resected, with subsequent improvement of 
hearing and alleviation of tinnitus.

388 Multiple Endocrine  
Neoplasia Syndromes
R. V. Thakker

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) is characterized by a predilection 
for tumors involving two or more endocrine glands. Four major forms 
of MEN are recognized and referred to as MEN types 1–4 (MEN 1–4) 
(Table 388-1). Each type of MEN is inherited as an autosomal domi-
nant syndrome or may occur sporadically, that is, without a family his-
tory. However, this distinction between familial and sporadic forms is 
often difficult because family members with the disease may have died 
before symptoms developed. In addition to MEN 1–4, at least six other 
syndromes  are  associated  with  multiple  endocrine  and  other  organ 
neoplasias (MEONs) (Table 388-2). These MEONs include the hyper-
parathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome, Carney complex, von 
Hippel–Lindau disease (Chap. 387), neurofibromatosis type 1 (Chap. 
90),  Cowden’s  syndrome  (CWS),  and  McCune-Albright  syndrome 
(MAS) (Chap. 412); all of these are inherited as autosomal dominant 
disorders, except for MAS, which is caused by mosaic expression of a 
postzygotic somatic cell mutation (Table 388-2).

A diagnosis of a MEN or MEON syndrome may be established in an 
individual by one of three criteria: (1) clinical features (two or more of 
the associated tumors [or lesions] in an individual); (2) familial pattern 
(one of the associated tumors [or lesions] in a first-degree relative of 
a  patient  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  the  syndrome);  and  (3)  genetic 
analysis (a germline mutation in the associated gene in an individual, 
who may be clinically affected or asymptomatic). Mutational analysis 
in  MEN  and  MEON  syndromes  is  helpful  in  clinical  practice  to  (1) 
confirm the clinical diagnosis; (2) identify family members who har-
bor the mutation and require screening for relevant tumor detection 
and early/appropriate treatment; and (3) identify the ~50% of family 
members who do not harbor the germline mutation and can, therefore, 
be alleviated of the anxiety of developing associated tumors. This latter 
aspect also helps to reduce health care costs by reducing the need for 
unnecessary biochemical and radiologic investigations.
 ■ MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA TYPE 1
Clinical  Manifestations  MEN  type  1  (MEN  1),  which  is  also 
referred  to  as  Wermer’s  syndrome,  is  characterized  by  the  triad  of 
tumors involving the parathyroids, pancreatic islets, and anterior pitu-
itary.  In  addition,  adrenal  cortical  tumors,  carcinoid  tumors  usually 
of the foregut, meningiomas, facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, and 
lipomas may also occur in some patients with MEN 1. Combinations 
of  the  affected  glands  and  their  pathologic  features  (e.g.,  hyperplastic 
adenomas  of  the  parathyroid  glands)  may  differ  in  members  of  the 
same  family  and  even  between  identical  twins.  In  addition,  a  nonfa-
milial (e.g., sporadic) form occurs in 8–14% of patients with MEN 1, 
and  molecular  genetic  studies  have  confirmed  the  occurrence  of  de 
novo mutations of the MEN1 gene in ~10% of patients with MEN 1.  
The prevalence of MEN 1 is ~0.25% based on randomly chosen post-
mortem studies but is 1–18% among patients with primary hyperpara-
thyroidism, 16–38% among patients with pancreatic islet tumors, and 
<3%  among  patients  with  pituitary  tumors.  The  disorder  affects  all 
age groups, with a reported age range of 5–81 years, with clinical and 
biochemical manifestations developing in the vast majority by the fifth 
decade. The clinical manifestations of MEN 1 are related to the sites 
of tumors and their hormonal products. In the absence of treatment, 
endocrine tumors are associated with an earlier mortality in patients 
with MEN 1, with a 50% probability of death by the age of 50 years. 
The cause of death is usually a malignant tumor, often from a pancre-
atic  neuroendocrine  tumor  (NET)  or  foregut  carcinoid.  In  addition, 
the treatment outcomes of patients with MEN 1–associated tumors are 
not as successful as those in patients with non–MEN 1 tumors. This 
is because MEN 1–associated tumors, with the exception of pituitary

feature of MEN 1. Patients may have asymptomatic hypercalcemia or 
vague  symptoms  associated  with  hypercalcemia  (e.g.,  polyuria,  poly-
dipsia, constipation, malaise, or dyspepsia). Nephrolithiasis and osteitis 
fibrosa cystica (less commonly) may also occur. Biochemical investiga-
tions reveal hypercalcemia, usually in association with elevated circu-
lating parathyroid hormone (PTH) (Table 388-3). The hypercalcemia 
is  usually  mild,  and  severe  hypercalcemia  or  parathyroid  cancer  is  a 
rare occurrence. Additional differences in the primary hyperparathy-
roidism of patients with MEN 1, as opposed to those without MEN 1, 
include an earlier age at onset (20–25 vs 55 years) and an equal male-
to-female ratio (1:1 vs 1:3). Preoperative imaging (e.g., neck ultrasound 
with  99mTc-sestamibi  parathyroid  scintigraphy)  is  of  limited  benefit 
because all parathyroid glands may be affected, and neck exploration 
may be required irrespective of preoperative localization studies.

TREATMENT
Parathyroid Tumors

Surgical  removal  of  the  abnormally  overactive  parathyroids  in 
patients with MEN 1 is the definitive treatment. However, it is con-
troversial whether to perform subtotal (e.g., removal of 3.5 glands) 
or  total  parathyroidectomy  with  or  without  autotransplantation 
of  parathyroid  tissue  in  the  forearm,  and  whether  surgery  should 
be  performed  at  an  early  or  late  stage.  Minimally  invasive  para-
thyroidectomy  is  not  recommended  because  all  four  parathyroid 
glands are usually affected with multiple adenomas or hyperplasia. 
Surgical  experience  should  be  taken  into  account  given  the  vari-
ability  in  pathology  in  MEN  1.  Calcimimetics  (e.g.,  cinacalcet), 
which act via the calcium-sensing receptor, have been used to treat 
primary  hyperparathyroidism  in  some  patients  when  surgery  is 
unsuccessful or contraindicated.

NETs, are usually multiple, making it difficult to achieve a successful 
surgical cure. Occult metastatic disease is also more prevalent in MEN 
1,  and  the  tumors  may  be  larger,  more  aggressive,  and  resistant  to 
treatment.

Parathyroid  Tumors  (See  also  Chap.  410)  Primary  hyper-
parathyroidism occurs in ~90% of patients and is the most common 

Pancreatic  Tumors  (See  also  Chap.  84)  The  incidence  of 
pancreatic islet cell tumors, which are NETs, in patients with MEN 1 
ranges from 30 to 80% in different series. Most of these tumors (Table 
388-1)  produce  excessive  amounts  of  hormone  (e.g.,  gastrin,  insulin, 
glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide [VIP]) and are associated 
with distinct clinical syndromes, although some are nonfunctioning or

nonsecretory. These pancreatic islet cell tumors have an earlier age at 
onset in patients with MEN 1 than in patients without MEN 1.

Gastrinoma  Gastrin-secreting  tumors  (gastrinomas)  are  asso-
ciated  with  marked  gastric  acid  production  and  recurrent  peptic 
ulcerations, a combination referred to as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. 
Gastrinomas occur more often in patients with MEN 1 who are aged  
>30 years. Recurrent severe multiple peptic ulcers, which may perfo-
rate, and cachexia are major contributors to the high mortality. Patients 
with  Zollinger-Ellison  syndrome  may  also  suffer  from  diarrhea  and 
steatorrhea.  The  diagnosis  is  established  by  demonstration  of  an  ele-
vated fasting serum gastrin concentration in association with increased 
basal  gastric  acid  secretion  (Table  388-3).  However,  the  diagnosis  of 
Zollinger-Ellison  syndrome  may  be  difficult  in  hypercalcemic  MEN 
1  patients  because  hypercalcemia  can  also  cause  hypergastrinemia. 
Ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography 
(CT), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), selective abdominal 
angiography, venous sampling, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 
(SRS) are helpful in localizing the tumor prior to surgery. Gastrinomas 
represent  >50%  of  all  pancreatic  NETs  in  patients  with  MEN  1,  and 
~20% of patients with gastrinomas will be found to have MEN 1. Gas-
trinomas, which may also occur in the duodenal mucosa, are the major 
cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with MEN 1.

TREATMENT
Gastrinoma

Medical treatment of patients with MEN 1 and Zollinger-Ellison syn-
drome is directed toward reducing basal acid output to <10 mmol/L. 
Parietal  cell  H+-K+-adenosine  triphosphatase  (ATPase)  inhibitors 
(e.g., omeprazole or lansoprazole) reduce acid output and are the 
drugs  of  choice  for  gastrinomas.  Some  patients  may  also  require 
additional  treatment  with  the  histamine  H2  receptor  antagonists 
cimetidine  or  ranitidine.  The  role  of  surgery  in  the  treatment  of 
gastrinomas  in  patients  with  MEN  1  is  controversial.  The  goal 
of  surgery  is  to  reduce  the  risk  of  distant  metastatic  disease  and 
improve  survival.  For  a  nonmetastatic  gastrinoma  situated  in  the 
pancreas,  surgical  excision  is  often  effective.  However,  the  risk  of 
hepatic metastases increases with tumor size, such that 25–40% of 
patients  with  pancreatic  NETs  >4  cm  develop  hepatic  metastases, 
and  50–70%  of  patients  with  tumors  2–3  cm  in  size  have  lymph 
node  metastases.  Survival  in  MEN  1  patients  with  gastrinomas   
<2.5 cm in size is 100% at 15 years, but 52% at 15 years, if metastatic 
disease is present. The presence of lymph node metastases does not 
appear  to  adversely  affect  survival.  Surgery  for  gastrinomas  that 
are  >2–2.5  cm  has  been  recommended,  because  the  disease-re-
lated  survival  in  these  patients  is  improved  following  surgery.  In 
addition,  duodenal  gastrinomas,  which  occur  more  frequently  in 
patients with MEN 1, have been treated successfully with surgery. 
However, in most patients with MEN 1, gastrinomas are multiple 

or  extrapancreatic,  and  with  the  exception  of  duodenal  gastrino-
mas,  surgery  is  rarely  successful.  For  example,  the  results  of  one 
study  revealed  that  only  ~15%  of  patients  with  MEN  1  were  free 
of  disease  immediately  after  surgery,  and  at  5  years,  this  number 
had decreased to ~5%; the respective outcomes in patients without 
MEN 1 were better, at 45 and 40%. Given these findings, most spe-
cialists recommend a nonsurgical management for gastrinomas in 
MEN 1, except as noted earlier for smaller, isolated lesions. Treat-
ment of disseminated gastrinomas is difficult. Chemotherapy with 
streptozotocin  and  5-fluorouracil;  hormonal  therapy  with  octreo-
tide or lanreotide, which are human somatostatin analogues (SSAs); 
selected internal radiation therapy (SIRT); radiofrequency ablation; 
peptide  radio  receptor  therapy  (PRRT);  hepatic  artery  emboliza-
tion; administration of human leukocyte interferon; and removal of 
all resectable tumor have been successful in some patients.

Insulinoma  These  β  islet  cell  insulin-secreting  tumors  represent 
10–30% of all pancreatic tumors in patients with MEN 1. Patients with 
an  insulinoma  present  with  hypoglycemic  symptoms  (e.g.,  weakness, 
headaches, sweating, faintness, seizures, altered behavior, weight gain) 
that typically develop after fasting or exertion and improve after glucose 
intake.  The  most  reliable  test  is  a  supervised  72-h  fast.  Biochemical 
investigations reveal increased plasma insulin concentrations in asso-
ciation with hypoglycemia (Table 388-3). Circulating concentrations of 
C peptide and proinsulin, which are also increased, are useful in estab-
lishing the diagnosis. It also is important to demonstrate the absence 
of  sulfonylureas  in  plasma  and  urine  samples  obtained  during  the 
investigation of hypoglycemia (Table 388-3). Surgical success is greatly 
enhanced  by  preoperative  localization  by  endoscopic  ultrasonogra-
phy,  CT  scanning,  or  celiac  axis  angiography.  Additional  localization 
methods  may  include  preoperative  and  perioperative  percutaneous 
transhepatic portal venous sampling, selective intraarterial stimulation 
with  hepatic  venous  sampling,  and  intraoperative  direct  pancreatic 
ultrasonography. Insulinomas occur in association with gastrinomas in 
10% of patients with MEN 1, and the two tumors may arise at different 
times. Insulinomas occur more often in patients with MEN 1 who are 
aged <40 years, and some arise in individuals aged <20 years. In con-
trast, in patients without MEN 1, insulinomas generally occur in those 
aged >40 years. Insulinomas may be the first manifestation of MEN 1 in 
10% of patients, and ~4% of patients with insulinomas will have MEN 1.

TREATMENT
Insulinoma

Medical treatment, which consists of frequent carbohydrate meals 
and diazoxide or octreotide, is not always successful, and surgery 
is  the  optimal  treatment.  Surgical  treatment,  which  ranges  from 
enucleation of a single tumor to a distal pancreatectomy or partial 
pancreatectomy, has been curative in many patients. Chemotherapy

(streptozotocin, 5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin), PRRT (e.g., with 
177Lu-DOTATATE),  or  hepatic  artery  embolization  has  been  used 
for metastatic disease.

Glucagonoma  These glucagon-secreting pancreatic NETs occur in 
<3% of patients with MEN 1. The characteristic clinical manifestations 
of  a  skin  rash  (necrolytic  migratory  erythema),  weight  loss,  anemia, 
and stomatitis may be absent. The tumor may have been detected in an 
asymptomatic patient with MEN 1 undergoing pancreatic imaging or 
by the finding of glucose intolerance and hyperglucagonemia.

TREATMENT
Glucagonoma

Surgical  removal  of  the  glucagonoma  is  the  treatment  of  choice. 
However,  treatment  may  be  difficult  because  ~50–80%  of  patients 
have  metastases  at  the  time  of  diagnosis.  Medical  treatment  with 
SSAs (e.g., octreotide or lanreotide) or chemotherapy with strepto-
zotocin and 5-fluorouracil has been successful in some patients, and 
hepatic artery embolization has been used to treat metastatic disease.

A

Vasoactive  Intestinal  Peptide  (VIP)  Tumors  (VIPomas)  
VIPomas have been reported in only a few patients with MEN 1. This 
clinical  syndrome  is  characterized  by  watery  diarrhea,  hypokalemia, 
and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome), which is also referred to as the 
Verner-Morrison syndrome, or the VIPoma syndrome. The diagnosis 
is  established  by  excluding  laxative  and  diuretic  abuse,  confirming  a 
stool volume in excess of 0.5–1.0 L/d during a fast, and documenting a 
markedly increased plasma VIP concentration.

TREATMENT
VIPomas

Surgical  management  of  VIPomas,  which  are  mostly  located  in 
the tail of the pancreas, can be curative. However, in patients with 
unresectable  tumor,  SSAs,  such  as  octreotide  and  lanreotide,  may 
be  effective.  Streptozotocin  with  5-fluorouracil  may  be  benefi-
cial,  along  with  hepatic  artery  embolization  for  the  treatment  of 
metastases.

B

Pancreatic  Polypeptide-Secreting  Tumors  (PPomas)  and 
Nonfunctioning Pancreatic NETs  PPomas are found in a large 
number of patients with MEN 1. No pathologic sequelae of excessive 
polypeptide (PP) secretion are apparent, and the clinical significance 
of  PP  is  unknown.  Many  PPomas  may  have  been  unrecognized  or 
classified  as  nonfunctioning  pancreatic  NETs,  which  likely  represent 
the  most  common  enteropancreatic  NET  associated  with  MEN  1  
(Fig.  388-1).  The  absence  of  both  a  clinical  syndrome  and  specific 
biochemical  abnormalities  may  result  in  a  delayed  diagnosis  of 
nonfunctioning  pancreatic  NETs,  which  are  associated  with  a  worse 
prognosis  than  other  functioning  tumors,  including  insulinoma  and 
gastrinoma. The optimum screening method and its timing interval for 
nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs remain to be established. At present, 
endoscopic ultrasound likely represents the most sensitive method of 
detecting small pancreatic tumors, but SRS is the most reliable method 
for detecting metastatic disease (Table 388-3).

TREATMENT
PPomas and Nonfunctioning Pancreatic NETs

The management of nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs in the asymp-
tomatic patient is controversial. One recommendation is to under-
take surgery irrespective of tumor size after biochemical assessment 
is complete. Alternatively, other experts recommend surgery based 
on tumor size, using either >1 cm or >2 cm at different centers. Pan-
creatoduodenal surgery is successful in removing the tumors in 80% 
of  patients,  but  >40%  of  patients  develop  complications,  including 

FIGURE  388-1  Pancreatic  nonfunctioning  neuroendocrine  tumor  (NET)  in  a 
14-year-old  patient  with  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  type  1  (MEN  1).  A.  An 
abdominal  magnetic  resonance  imaging  scan  revealed  a  low-intensity  >2.0  cm 
(anteroposterior  maximal  diameter)  tumor  within  the  neck  of  pancreas.  There 
was  no  evidence  of  invasion  of  adjacent  structures  or  metastases.  The  tumor 
is  indicated  by  white  dashed  circle.  B.  The  pancreatic  NET  was  removed  by 
surgery,  and  macroscopic  examination  confirmed  the  location  of  the  tumor 
(white  dashed  circles)  in  the  neck  of  the  pancreas.  Immunohistochemistry 
showed  the  tumor  to  immunostain  for  chromogranin  A,  but  not  gastrointestinal 
peptides or menin, thereby confirming that it was a nonsecreting NET due to loss 
of  menin  expression.  (Part  A  reproduced  with  permission  from  PJ  Newey  et  al:

diabetes mellitus, frequent steatorrhea, early and late dumping syn-
dromes, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. However, ~50–60% of 
patients treated surgically survive >5 years. When considering these 
recommendations, it is important to consider that occult metastatic 
disease (e.g., tumors not detected by imaging investigations) is likely 
to be present in a substantial proportion of these patients at the time 
of presentation. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) and 
of  the  mammalian  target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR)  signaling  pathway 
have been reported to be effective in treating pancreatic NET metas-
tases and in doubling the progression-free survival time. Additional 
treatments for metastatic disease include PRRT using 177Lu-DOTA-
TATE,  chemotherapy,  radiofrequency  ablation,  transarterial  che-
moemobilization, and SIRT.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismOther  Pancreatic  NETs  NETs  secreting  growth  hormone– 
releasing  hormone  (GHRH),  GHRHomas,  have  been  reported  rarely 
in  patients  with  MEN  1.  It  is  estimated  that  ~33%  of  patients  with 
GHRHomas have other MEN 1–related tumors. GHRHomas may be 
diagnosed by demonstrating elevated serum concentrations of growth 
hormone  and  GHRH.  More  than  50%  of  GHRHomas  occur  in  the 
lung, 30% occur in the pancreas, and 10% are found in the small intes-
tine.  Somatostatinomas  secrete  somatostatin,  a  peptide  that  inhibits 
the  secretion  of  a  variety  of  hormones,  resulting  in  hyperglycemia, 
cholelithiasis, low acid output, steatorrhea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
anemia,  and  weight  loss.  Although  7%  of  pancreatic  NETs  secrete 
somatostatin,  the  clinical  features  of  somatostatinoma  syndrome  are 
unusual in patients with MEN 1.

Pituitary Tumors (See also Chap. 380)  Pituitary tumors occur 
in 15–50% of patients with MEN 1 (Table 388-1), and ~75% of these are 
microadenomas (<1 cm diameter). The tumors occur as early as 5 years 
of age or as late as the ninth decade. MEN 1 pituitary adenomas are 
more frequent in women than men, in whom they are often macroad-
enomas (>1 cm diameter). There are no specific histologic parameters 
that differentiate between MEN 1 and non–MEN 1 pituitary tumors. 
Approximately 60% of MEN 1–associated pituitary tumors secrete pro-
lactin, <25% secrete growth hormone, 5% secrete adrenocorticotropic 
hormone  (ACTH),  and  the  remainder  appear  to  be  nonfunctioning, 
with  some  secreting  glycoprotein  subunits  (Table  388-1).  However, 
pituitary tumors derived from MEN 1 patients may exhibit immunore-
activity to several hormones. In particular, there is a greater frequency 
of somatolactotrope tumors. Prolactinomas are the first manifestation 
of  MEN  1  in  ~15%  of  patients,  whereas  somatotrope  tumors  occur 
more often in patients aged >40 years. Fewer than 3% of patients with 
anterior  pituitary  tumors  will  have  MEN  1.  Clinical  manifestations 
are similar to those in patients with sporadic pituitary tumors without 
MEN 1 and depend on the hormone secreted and the size of the pitu-
itary tumor. Thus, patients may have symptoms of hyperprolactinemia 
(e.g., amenorrhea, infertility, and galactorrhea in women, or impotence 
and  infertility  in  men)  or  have  features  of  acromegaly  or  Cushing’s 
disease. In addition, enlarging pituitary tumors may compress adjacent 
structures such as the optic chiasm or normal pituitary tissue, causing 
visual disturbances and/or hypopituitarism. In asymptomatic patients 
with MEN 1, periodic biochemical monitoring of serum prolactin and 
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, as well as MRI of the pitu-
itary, can lead to early identification of pituitary tumors (Table 388-3). In 
patients with abnormal results, hypothalamic-pituitary testing should 
characterize  the  nature  of  the  pituitary  lesion  and  its  effects  on  the 
secretion of other pituitary hormones.

TREATMENT
Pituitary Tumors

Treatment  of  pituitary  tumors  in  patients  with  MEN  1  consists 
of therapies similar to those used in patients without MEN 1 and 
includes appropriate medical therapy (e.g., bromocriptine or caber-
goline for prolactinoma; or octreotide or lanreotide for somatotrope 
tumors)  or  selective  transsphenoidal  adenomectomy,  if  feasible, 
with radiotherapy reserved for residual unresectable tumor tissue.

Associated Tumors  Patients  with  MEN  1  may  also  develop  car-
cinoid tumors, adrenal cortical tumors, facial angiofibromas, collage-
nomas, thyroid tumors, and lipomatous tumors.

Carcinoid  Tumors  (See  also  Chap.  84)  Carcinoid  tumors 
occur  in  >3%  of  patients  with  MEN  1  (Table  388-1).  The  carcinoid 
tumor may be located in the bronchi, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, 
or thymus. At the time of diagnosis, most patients are asymptomatic 
and  do  not  have  clinical  features  of  the  carcinoid  syndrome.  Impor-
tantly,  no  hormonal  or  biochemical  abnormality  (e.g.,  plasma  chro-
mogranin  A)  is  consistently  observed  in  individuals  with  thymic  or 
bronchial carcinoid tumors. Thus, screening for these tumors is depen-
dent on radiologic imaging. The optimum method for screening has

not been established. CT and MRI are sensitive for detecting thymic and 
bronchial tumors (Table 388-3), although repeated CT scanning raises 
concern about exposure to repeated doses of ionizing radiation. Octreo-
tide scintigraphy may also reveal some thymic and bronchial carcinoids, 
although  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  recommend  its  routine  use. 
Gastric  carcinoids,  of  which  the  type  II  gastric  enterochromaffin- 
like  (ECL)  cell  carcinoids  (ECLomas)  are  associated  with  MEN  1  
and  Zollinger-Ellison  syndrome,  may  be  detected  incidentally  at  the 
time of gastric endoscopy for dyspeptic symptoms in MEN 1 patients. 
These  tumors,  which  may  be  found  in  >10%  of  MEN  1  patients,  are 
usually  multiple  and  sized  <1.5  cm.  Bronchial  carcinoids  in  patients 
with  MEN  1  occur  predominantly  in  women  (male-to-female  ratio, 
1:4). In contrast, thymic carcinoids in European patients with MEN 1 
occur  predominantly  in  men  (male-to-female  ratio,  20:1),  with  ciga-
rette smokers having a higher risk for these tumors; thymic carcinoids 
in  Japanese  patients  with  MEN  1  have  a  less  marked  sex  difference 
(male-to-female ratio 2:1). The course of thymic carcinoids in MEN 1 
appears to be particularly aggressive. The presence of thymic tumors 
in  patients  with  MEN  1  is  associated  with  a  median  survival  after 
diagnosis  of  ~9.5  years,  with  70%  of  patients  dying  as  a  direct  result 
of the tumor.

TREATMENT
Carcinoid Tumors

If  resectable,  surgical  removal  of  carcinoid  tumors  is  the  treat-
ment  of  choice.  For  patients  with  unresectable  tumors  and  those 
with  metastatic  disease,  treatment  with  SSAs,  radiotherapy,  che-
motherapeutic  agents  (e.g.,  fluorouracil,  temozolomide,  cisplatin, 
etoposide),  mTOR  inhibitors  (e.g.,  everolimus),  or  PRRT  therapy 
has  resulted  in  symptom  improvement  and  regression  of  some 
tumors.  Little  is  known  about  the  malignant  potential  of  gastric 
type II ECLomas, but treatment with SSAs has resulted in regres-
sion of these ECLomas.

Adrenocortical  Tumors  (See  also  Chap.  386)  Asymptom-
atic adrenocortical tumors occur in 20–70% of patients with MEN 1 
depending  on  the  radiologic  screening  methods  used  (Table  388-1). 
Most of these tumors, which include cortical adenomas, hyperplasia, 
multiple  adenomas,  nodular  hyperplasia,  cysts,  and  carcinomas,  are 
nonfunctioning. Indeed, <10% of patients with enlarged adrenal glands 
have hormonal hypersecretion, with primary hyperaldosteronism and 
ACTH-independent  Cushing’s  syndrome  being  encountered  most 
commonly. Occasionally, hyperandrogenemia may occur in association 
with  adrenocortical  carcinoma.  Pheochromocytoma  in  association 
with MEN 1 is rare. Biochemical investigation (e.g., plasma renin and 
aldosterone concentrations, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, 
urinary catecholamines, and/or metanephrines) should be undertaken 
in  those  with  symptoms  or  signs  suggestive  of  functioning  adrenal 
tumors  or  in  those  with  tumors  >1  cm.  Adrenocortical  carcinoma 
occurs  in  ~1%  of  MEN  1  patients  but  increases  to  >10%  for  adrenal 
tumors >1 cm.

TREATMENT
Adrenocortical Tumors

Consensus  has  not  been  reached  about  the  management  of  MEN 
1–associated nonfunctioning adrenal tumors, because the majority 
are  benign.  However,  the  risk  of  malignancy  increases  with  size, 
particularly  for  tumors  with  a  diameter  >4  cm.  Indications  for 
surgery for adrenal tumors include size >4 cm in diameter, atypical 
or suspicious radiologic features (e.g., increased Hounsfield unit on 
unenhanced CT scan) and size of 1–4 cm in diameter, or significant 
measurable growth over a 6-month period. The treatment of func-
tioning (e.g., hormone-secreting) adrenal tumors is similar to that 
for tumors occurring in non–MEN 1 patients.

2988 Meningioma  Central  nervous  system  (CNS)  tumors,  including 
ependymomas,  schwannomas,  and  meningiomas,  have  been  reported 
in  MEN  1  patients  (Table  388-1).  Meningiomas  are  found  in  <10%  of 
patients with other clinical manifestations of MEN 1 (e.g., primary hyper-
parathyroidism) for >15 years. The majority of meningiomas are not asso-
ciated with symptoms, and 60% do not enlarge. The treatment of MEN 
1–associated meningiomas is similar to that in non–MEN 1 patients.
Lipomas  Subcutaneous  lipomas  occur  in  >33%  of  patients  with 
MEN 1 (Table 388-1) and are frequently multiple. In addition, visceral, 
pleural, or retroperitoneal lipomas may occur in patients with MEN 1. 
Management  is  conservative.  However,  when  surgically  removed  for 
cosmetic reasons, they typically do not recur.
Facial  Angiofibromas  and  Collagenomas  The  occurrence  of 
multiple facial angiofibromas in patients with MEN 1 may range from 
>20  to  >90%,  and  occurrence  of  collagenomas  may  range  from  0  to 
>70%  (Table  388-1).  These  cutaneous  findings  may  allow  presymp-
tomatic diagnosis of MEN 1 in the relatives of a patient with MEN 1. 
Treatment for these cutaneous lesions is usually not required.
Thyroid  Tumors  Thyroid  tumors,  including  adenomas,  colloid 
goiters,  and  carcinomas,  have  been  reported  to  occur  in  >25%  of 
patients  with  MEN  1.  However,  the  prevalence  of  thyroid  disorders 
in  the  general  population  is  high,  and  it  has  been  suggested  that  the 
association  of  thyroid  abnormalities  in  patients  with  MEN  1  may  be 
incidental. The treatment of thyroid tumors in MEN 1 patients is sim-
ilar to that for non–MEN 1 patients.

Genetics and Screening  The MEN1 gene is located on chro-
mosome  11q13  and  consists  of  10  exons,  which  encode  a  610–
amino  acid  protein,  menin,  that  regulates  transcription,  genome 
stability, cell division, and proliferation. The pathophysiology of MEN 1 
follows the Knudson two-hit hypothesis with a tumor-suppressor role 
for menin. Inheritance of a germline MEN1 mutation predisposes an 
individual to developing a tumor that arises following a somatic muta-
tion,  which  may  be  a  point  mutation  or  more  commonly  a  deletion, 
leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor DNA. The germ-
line mutations of the MEN1 gene are scattered throughout the entire 
1830-bp coding region and splice sites, and there is no apparent correla-
tion between the location of MEN1 mutations and clinical manifesta-
tions  of  the  disorder,  in  contrast  with  the  situation  in  patients  with 
MEN  2  (Table  388-1).  More  than  10%  of  MEN1  germline  mutations 
arise de novo and may be transmitted to subsequent generations. Some 
families with MEN 1 mutations develop parathyroid tumors as the sole 
endocrinopathy,  and  this  condition  is  referred  to  as  familial  isolated 
hyperparathyroidism (FIHP). However, between 5 and 25% of patients 
with  MEN  1  do  not  harbor  germline  mutations  or  deletions  of  the 
MEN1 gene. Such patients with MEN 1–associated tumors but without 
MEN1 mutations may represent phenocopies or have mutations involv-
ing  other  genes.  Other  genes  associated  with  MEN  1–like  features 
include CDC73, which encodes parafibromin, whose mutations result 
in  the  HPT-JT  syndrome;  the  calcium-sensing  receptor  gene  (CaSR), 
whose mutations result in familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia 
(FBHH);  and  the  aryl  hydrocarbon  receptor  interacting  protein  gene 
(AIP), a tumor suppressor located on chromosome 11q13 whose muta-
tions are associated with familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA). 
Genetic testing to determine the MEN1 mutation status in symptomatic 
family members within a MEN 1 kindred, as well as in all index cases 
(e.g.,  patients)  with  two  or  more  endocrine  tumors,  is  advisable.  If  a 
MEN1 mutation is not identified in the index case with two or more 
endocrine tumors, clinical and genetic tests for other disorders such as 
HPT-JT syndrome, FBHH, FIPA, MEN 2, or MEN 4 should be consid-
ered because these patients may represent phenocopies for MEN 1.

The current guidelines recommend that MEN1 mutational analysis 
should be undertaken in (1) an index case with two or more MEN 1–
associated endocrine tumors (e.g., parathyroid, pancreatic, or pituitary 
tumors);  (2)  asymptomatic  first-degree  relatives  of  a  known  MEN1 
mutation  carrier;  and  (3)  first-degree  relatives  of  a  MEN1  mutation 
carrier with symptoms, signs, or biochemical or radiologic evidence for 
one or more MEN 1–associated tumors. In addition, MEN1 mutational 

analysis  should  be  considered  in  patients  with  suspicious  or  atypical 
MEN  1.  This  would  include  individuals  with  parathyroid  adenomas 
before the age of 30 years or multigland parathyroid disease; individu-
als with gastrinoma or multiple pancreatic NETs at any age; or individu-
als who have two or more MEN 1–associated tumors that are not part of 
the classical triad of parathyroid, pancreatic islet, and anterior pituitary 
tumors (e.g., parathyroid tumor plus adrenal tumor). Family members, 
including asymptomatic individuals who have been identified to harbor 
a  MEN1  mutation,  will  require  biochemical  and  radiologic  screening 
(Table 388-3). In contrast, relatives who do not harbor the MEN1 muta-
tion have a risk of developing MEN 1–associated endocrine tumors that 
is similar to that of the general population; thus, relatives without the 
MEN1 mutation do not require repeated screening.

Mutational  analysis  in  asymptomatic  individuals  should  be  under-
taken at the earliest opportunity and, if possible, in the first decade of life 
because tumors have developed in some children by the age of 5 years. 
Appropriate  biochemical  and  radiologic  investigations  (Table  388-3) 
aimed at detecting the development of tumors should then be under-
taken  in  affected  individuals.  Mutant  gene  carriers  should  undergo 
biochemical screening at least once per annum and also have baseline 
pituitary and abdominal imaging (e.g., MRI or CT), which should then 
be  repeated  at  1-  to  3-year  intervals  (Table  388-3).  Screening  should 
commence  after  5  years  of  age  and  should  continue  for  life  because 
the  disease  may  develop  as  late  as  the  eighth  decade.  The  screening 
history  and  physical  examination  elicit  the  symptoms  and  signs  of 
hypercalcemia; nephrolithiasis; peptic ulcer disease; neuroglycopenia; 
hypopituitarism; galactorrhea and amenorrhea in women; acromegaly; 
Cushing’s disease; and visual field loss and the presence of subcutane-
ous lipomas, angiofibromas, and collagenomas. Biochemical screening 
should include measurements of serum calcium, PTH, gastrointestinal 
hormones (e.g., gastrin, insulin with a fasting glucose, glucagon, VIP, 
PP),  chromogranin  A,  prolactin,  and  IGF-1  in  all  individuals.  More 
specific endocrine function tests should be undertaken in individuals 
who have symptoms or signs suggestive of a specific clinical syndrome. 
Biochemical  screening  for  the  development  of  MEN  1  tumors  in 
asymptomatic members of families with MEN 1 is of great importance 
to reduce morbidity and mortality from the associated tumors.

 ■ MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA TYPE 2 AND 
TYPE 3
Clinical  Manifestations  MEN  type  2  (MEN  2),  which  is  also 
called Sipple’s syndrome, is characterized by the association of medul-
lary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytomas, and parathyroid 
tumors (Table 388-1). Three clinical variants of MEN 2 are recognized: 
MEN 2A, MEN 2B, and MTC only. MEN 2A, which is often referred to 
as MEN 2, is the most common variant. In MEN 2A, MTC is associated 
with  pheochromocytomas  in  50%  of  patients  (may  be  bilateral)  and 
with parathyroid tumors in 20% of patients. MEN 2A may rarely occur 
in  association  with  Hirschsprung’s  disease,  caused  by  the  absence  of 
autonomic ganglion cells in the terminal hindgut, resulting in colonic 
dilatation,  severe  constipation,  and  obstruction.  MEN  2A  may  also 
be  associated  with  cutaneous  lichen  amyloidosis,  which  is  a  pruritic 
lichenoid  lesion  that  is  usually  located  on  the  upper  back.  MEN  2B, 
which is also referred to as MEN 3, represents 5% of all cases of MEN 
2 and is characterized by the occurrence of MTC and pheochromocy-
toma  in  association  with  a  Marfanoid  habitus;  mucosal  neuromas  of 
the lips, tongue, and eyelids; medullated corneal fibers; and intestinal 
autonomic ganglion dysfunction leading to multiple diverticulae and 
megacolon. Parathyroid tumors do not usually occur in MEN 2B. MTC 
only (FMTC) is a variant in which MTC is the sole manifestation of the 
syndrome.  However,  the  distinction  between  FMTC  and  MEN  2A  is 
difficult and should only be considered if there are at least four family 
members aged >50 years who are affected by MTC but not pheochro-
mocytomas or primary hyperparathyroidism. All of the MEN 2 vari-
ants are due to mutations of the rearranged during transfection (RET) 
protooncogene, which encodes a TKR. Moreover, there is a correlation 
between  the  locations  of  RET  mutations  and  MEN  2  variants.  Thus, 
~95% of MEN 2A patients have mutations involving the cysteine-rich

extracellular  domain,  with  mutations  of  codon  634  accounting  for 
~85% of MEN 2A mutations; FMTC patients also have mutations of 
the cysteine-rich extracellular domain, with most mutations occurring 
in  codon  618.  In  contrast,  ~95%  of  MEN  2B/MEN  3  patients  have 
mutations  of  codon  918  of  the  intracellular  tyrosine  kinase  domain 
(Table 388-1 and Table 388-4).

Medullary  Thyroid  Carcinoma  MTC  is  the  most  common 
feature  of  MEN  2A  and  MEN  2B  and  occurs  in  almost  all  affected 
individuals.  MTC  represents  5–10%  of  all  thyroid  gland  carcinomas, 
and  20%  of  MTC  patients  have  a  family  history  of  the  disorder.  The 
use of  RET mutational analysis to identify family members at risk for 
hereditary forms of MTC has altered the presentation of MTC from that 
of symptomatic tumors to a preclinical disease for which prophylactic 
thyroidectomy  (Table  388-4)  is  undertaken  to  improve  the  prognosis 
and ideally result in cure. However, in patients who do not have a known 
family history of MEN 2A, FMTC, or MEN 2B, and therefore have not 
had RET mutational analysis, MTC may present as a palpable mass in 
the neck, which may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of 
pressure or dysphagia in >15% of patients. Diarrhea occurs in 30% of 
patients and is associated either with elevated circulating concentrations 
of calcitonin or tumor-related secretion of serotonin and prostaglandins. 
Some patients may also experience flushing. In addition, ectopic ACTH 
production by MTC may cause Cushing’s syndrome. The diagnosis of 
MTC relies on the demonstration of hypercalcitoninemia (>90 pg/mL in 
the basal state); stimulation tests using IV pentagastrin (0.5 mg/kg) and 
or calcium infusion (2 mg/kg) are rarely used now, reflecting improve-
ments in the assay for calcitonin. Neck ultrasonography with fine-needle 
aspiration  of  the  nodules  can  confirm  the  diagnosis.  Radionucleotide 
thyroid scans may reveal MTC tumors as “cold” nodules. Radiography 
may reveal dense irregular calcification within the involved portions of 
the  thyroid  gland  and  in  lymph  nodes  involved  with  metastases.  Pos-
itron  emission  tomography  (PET)  may  help  to  identify  the  MTC  and 
metastases (Fig. 388-2). Metastases of MTC usually occur to the cervi-
cal lymph nodes in the early stages and to the mediastinal nodes, lung, 
liver,  trachea,  adrenal,  esophagus,  and  bone  in  later  stages.  Elevations 
in serum calcitonin concentrations are often the first sign of recurrence 
or persistent disease, and the serum calcitonin doubling time is useful 
for determining prognosis. MTC can have an aggressive clinical course, 
with early metastases and death in ~10% of patients. A family history of 
aggressive MTC or MEN 2B may be elicited.

TREATMENT
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma

Individuals  with  RET  mutations  who  do  not  have  clinical  mani-
festations of MTC should be offered prophylactic surgery between 
the ages of <1 and 5 years. The timing of surgery will depend on 

the  type  of  RET  mutation  and  its  associated  risk  for  early  devel-
opment, metastasis, and aggressive growth of MTC (Table 388-4). 
Such patients should have a total thyroidectomy with a systematic 
central neck dissection to remove occult nodal metastasis, although 
the  value  of  undertaking  a  central  neck  dissection  has  been  sub-
ject to debate. Prophylactic thyroidectomy, with lifelong thyroxine 
replacement, has dramatically improved outcomes in patients with 
MEN  2  and  MEN  3,  such  that  ~90%  of  young  patients  with RET 
mutations who had a prophylactic thyroidectomy have no evidence

of persistent or recurrent MTC at 7 years after surgery. In patients 
with  clinically  evident  MTC,  a  total  thyroidectomy  with  bilateral 
central  resection  is  recommended,  and  an  ipsilateral  lateral  neck 
dissection should be undertaken if the primary tumor is >1 cm in 
size  or  there  is  evidence  of  nodal  metastasis  in  the  central  neck. 
Surgery is the only curative therapy for MTC. The 10-year survival 
in patients with metastatic MTC is ~20%. For inoperable MTC or 
metastatic disease, TKR inhibitors (e.g., vandetanib, cabozantinib, 
selpercatinib)  have  improved  the  progression-free  survival  times. 
PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE has been reported to be beneficial for 
metastatic MTCs that were found by SRS to express somatostatin 
receptors. Other types of chemotherapy are of limited efficacy, but 
radiotherapy may help to palliate local disease.

Pheochromocytoma (See also Chap. 387)  These noradrenaline- 
and adrenaline-secreting tumors occur in >50% of patients with MEN 
2A  and  MEN  2B  and  are  a  major  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality. 
Patients  may  have  symptoms  and  signs  of  catecholamine  secretion 
(e.g.,  headaches,  palpitations,  sweating,  poorly  controlled  hyperten-
sion), or they may be asymptomatic with detection through biochem-
ical  screening  based  on  a  history  of  familial  MEN  2A,  MEN  2B,  or 
MTC.  Pheochromocytomas  in  patients  with  MEN  2A  and  MEN  2B 
differ significantly in distribution when compared with patients with-
out MEN 2A and MEN 2B. Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas, which 
occur in 10% of patients without MEN 2A and MEN 2B, are observed 
rarely in patients with MEN 2A and MEN 2B. Malignant pheochromo-
cytomas are much less common in patients with MEN 2A and MEN 
2B.  The  biochemical  and  radiologic  investigation  of  pheochromocy-
toma in patients with MEN 2A and MEN 2B is similar to that in non–
MEN  2  patients  and  includes  the  measurement  of  plasma  (obtained 
from  supine  patients)  and  urinary  free  fractionated  metanephrines 
(e.g.,  normetanephrine  and  metanephrines  measured  separately), 
CT  or  MRI  scanning,  radionuclide  scanning  with  meta-iodo-(123I  or 
131I)-benzyl  guanidine  (MIBG),  and  PET  using  (18F)-fluorodopamine 
or (18F)-fluoro-2-dexoxy-d-glucose (Fig. 388-2).

TREATMENT
Pheochromocytoma

Surgical  removal  of  pheochromocytoma,  using  α  and  β  adreno-
receptor  blockade  before  and  during  the  operation,  is  the  rec-
ommended  treatment.  Other  antihypertensive  agents,  including 
calcium  channel  blockers,  are  sometimes  required  for  adequate 
blood pressure control. Endoscopic adrenal-sparing surgery, which 
decreases  postoperative  morbidity,  hospital  stay,  and  expense,  as 
opposed to open surgery, has become the method of choice.

Parathyroid Tumors (See also Chap. 410)  Parathyroid tumors 
occur in 10–25% of patients with MEN 2A. However, >50% of these 
patients  do  not  have  hypercalcemia.  The  presence  of  abnormally 
enlarged parathyroids, which are unusually hyperplastic, is often seen 
in  the  normocalcemic  patient  undergoing  thyroidectomy  for  MTC. 
The biochemical investigation and treatment of hypercalcemic patients 
with MEN 2A is similar to that of patients with MEN 1.

Genetics and Screening  To  date,  ~50  different  RET  muta-
tions have been reported, and these are located in exons 5, 8, 10, 
11,  13,  14,  15,  and  16.  RET  germline  mutations  are  detected  in 
>95%  of  MEN  2A,  FMTC,  and  MEN  2B  families,  with  Cys634Arg 
being most common in MEN 2A, Cys618Arg being most common in 
FMTC, and Met918Thr being most common in MEN 2B (Tables 388-1 
and  388-4).  Between  5  and  10%  of  patients  with  MTC  or  MEN  2A–
associated tumors have de novo RET germline mutations, and ~50% of 
patients with MEN 2B have de novo RET germline mutations. These de 
novo  RET  germline  mutations  always  occur  on  the  paternal  allele. 
Approximately 5% of patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma have 
a  germline  RET  mutation,  but  such  germline  RET  mutations  do  not 
appear  to  be  associated  with  sporadic  primary  hyperparathyroidism. 
Thus, RET mutational analysis should be performed in (1) all patients 

with MTC who have a family history of tumors associated with MEN 
2,  FMTC,  or  MEN  3,  such  that  the  diagnosis  can  be  confirmed  and 
genetic testing offered to asymptomatic relatives; (2) all patients with 
MTC and pheochromocytoma without a known family history of MEN 
2 or MEN 3; (3) all patients with MTC, but without a family history of 
MEN 2, FMTC, or MEN 3, because these patients may have a de novo 
germline RET mutations; (4) all patients with bilateral pheochromocy-
toma; and (5) patients with unilateral pheochromocytoma, particularly 
if this occurs with increased calcitonin levels.

Screening  for  MEN  2/MEN  3–associated  tumors  in  patients  with 
RET germline mutations should be undertaken annually and include 
serum calcitonin measurements, a neck ultrasound for MTC, plasma 
(or 24-h urinary) fractionated metanephrines for pheochromocytoma, 
and  albumin-corrected  serum  calcium  or  ionized  calcium  with  PTH 
for primary hyperparathyroidism. In patients with MEN 2–associated 
RET  mutations,  screening  for  MTC  should  begin  by  1–5  years,  for 
pheochromocytoma  by  11–16  years,  and  for  primary  hyperparathy-
roidism by 11–16 years of age (Table 388-4).
 ■ MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA TYPE 4
Clinical Manifestations  Patients with MEN 1–associated tumors, 
such  as  parathyroid  adenomas,  pituitary  adenomas,  and  pancreatic 
NETs, occurring in association with gonadal, adrenal, renal, and thy-
roid tumors have been reported to have mutations of the gene encod-
ing the 196–amino acid cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CK1) p27 
kip1  (CDKN1B).  Such  families  with  MEN  1–associated  tumors  and 
CDKN1B mutations are designated to have MEN 4 (Table 388-1). The 
investigations  and  treatments  for  the  MEN  4–associated  tumors  are 
similar to those for MEN 1 and non–MEN 1 tumors.

Genetics  and  Screening  To  date,  50  MEN  patients  (from 
<20  kindreds)  with  mutations  of  CDKN1B,  which  is  located  on 
chromosome 12p13, have been reported, and all of these are pre-
dicted to result in a loss of function. These MEN 4 patients may rep-
resent  ~3%  of  the  5–10%  of  patients  with  MEN  1  who  do  not  have 
mutations of the MEN1 gene. Germline CDKN1B mutations may rarely 
be found in patients with sporadic (i.e., nonfamilial) forms of primary 
hyperparathyroidism.
 ■ HYPERPARATHYROIDISM-JAW TUMOR 
SYNDROME (SEE ALSO CHAP. 410)
Clinical  Manifestations  Hyperparathyroidism-jaw 
tumor 
(HPT-JT)  syndrome  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder  character-
ized by the development of parathyroid tumors (15% are carcinomas) 
and  fibro-osseous  jaw  tumors.  In  addition,  some  patients  may  also 
develop  Wilms’  tumors,  renal  cysts,  renal  hamartomas,  renal  cortical 
adenomas,  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC),  pancreatic  adenocarcinomas, 
uterine tumors, testicular mixed germ cell tumors with a major semi-
noma component, and Hürthle cell thyroid adenomas. The parathyroid 
tumors may occur in isolation and without any evidence of jaw tumors, 
and  this  may  cause  confusion  with  other  hereditary  hypercalcemic 
disorders, such as MEN 1. However, genetic testing to identify the caus-
ative mutation will help to establish the correct diagnosis. The inves-
tigation  and  treatment  for  HPT-JT–associated  tumors  are  similar  to 
those in non-HPT-JT patients, except that early parathyroidectomy is 
advisable because of the increased frequency of parathyroid carcinoma.

Genetics  and  Screening  The  gene  that  causes  HPT-JT  is 
located  on  chromosome  1q31.2  and  encodes  a  531–amino  acid 
protein, parafibromin (Table 388-2). Parafibromin is also referred 
to as cell division cycle protein 73 (CDC73) and has a role in transcrip-
tion. Genetic testing in families helps to identify mutation carriers who 
should  be  periodically  screened  for  the  development  of  tumors  
(Table 388-5).

didymis; RCC; pheochromocytomas; and pancreatic islet cell tumors. 
The retinal and CNS hemangioblastomas are benign vascular tumors 
that may be multiple; those in the CNS may cause symptoms by com-
pressing  adjacent  structures  and/or  increasing  intracranial  pressure. 
In  the  CNS,  the  cerebellum  and  spinal  cord  are  the  most  frequently 
involved sites. The renal abnormalities consist of cysts and carcinomas, 
and the lifetime risk of RCC in VHL is 70%. The endocrine tumors in 
VHL consist of pheochromocytomas and pancreatic islet cell tumors. 
The clinical presentation of pheochromocytoma in VHL disease is sim-
ilar to that in sporadic cases, except that there is a higher frequency of 
bilateral or multiple tumors, which may involve extra-adrenal sites in 
VHL disease. The most frequent pancreatic lesions in VHL are multiple 
cyst-adenomas,  which  rarely  cause  clinical  disease.  However,  nonse-
creting  pancreatic  islet  cell  tumors  occur  in  <10%  of  VHL  patients, 
who are usually asymptomatic. The pancreatic tumors in these patients 
are  often  detected  by  regular  screening  using  abdominal  imaging. 
Pheochromocytomas should be investigated and treated as described 
earlier for MEN 2. The pancreatic islet cell tumors frequently become 
malignant, and early surgery is recommended.

Genetics and Screening  The VHL gene, which is located on 
chromosome 3p26-p25, is widely expressed in human tissues and 
encodes a 213–amino acid protein (pVHL) (Table 388-2). A wide 
variety of germline VHL mutations have been identified. VHL acts as a 
tumor-suppressor  gene.  A  correlation  between  the  type  of  mutation 
and  the  clinical  phenotype  has  been  reported;  large  deletions  and  
protein-truncating  mutations  are  associated  with  a  low  incidence  of 
pheochromocytomas,  whereas  some  missense  mutations  in  VHL 
patients  are  associated  with  pheochromocytoma  (referred  to  as  VHL 
type  2C).  Other  missense  mutations  may  be  associated  with  heman-
gioblastomas  and  RCC  but  not  pheochromocytoma  (referred  to  as 
VHL type 1), whereas distinct missense mutations are associated with 
hemangioblastomas,  RCC,  and  pheochromocytoma  (VHL  type  2B). 
VHL  type  2A,  which  refers  to  the  occurrence  of  hemangioblastomas 
and pheochromocytoma without RCC, is associated with rare missense 
mutations. The basis for these complex genotype-phenotype relation-
ships remains to be elucidated. One major function of pVHL, which is 
also referred to as elongin, is to downregulate the expression of vascu-
lar  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  and  other  hypoxia-inducible 
mRNAs.  Thus,  pVHL,  in  complex  with  other  proteins,  regulates  the 
expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2) such that 
loss  of  functional  pVHL  leads  to  a  stabilization  of  the  HIF  protein 
complexes, resulting in VEGF overexpression and tumor angiogenesis. 
Screening for the development of pheochromocytomas and pancreatic 
islet cell tumors is as described earlier for MEN 2 and MEN 1, respec-
tively (Tables 388-3 and 388-4).

 ■ NEUROFIBROMATOSIS
Clinical Manifestations  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which 
is  also  referred  to  as  von  Recklinghausen’s  disease,  is  an  autosomal 
dominant  disorder  characterized  by  the  following  manifestations: 
neurologic  (e.g.,  peripheral  and  spinal  neurofibromas);  ophthalmo-
logic (e.g., optic gliomas and iris hamartomas such as Lisch nodules); 
dermatologic (e.g., café au lait macules); skeletal (e.g., scoliosis, macro-
cephaly, short stature, pseudoarthrosis); vascular (e.g., stenoses of renal 
and  intracranial  arteries);  and  endocrine  (e.g.,  pheochromocytoma, 
carcinoid  tumors,  precocious  puberty).  Neurofibromatosis  type  2 
(NF2) is also an autosomal dominant disorder but is characterized by 
the  development  of  bilateral  vestibular  schwannomas  (acoustic  neu-
romas) that lead to deafness, tinnitus, or vertigo. Some patients with 
NF2 also develop meningiomas, spinal schwannomas, peripheral nerve 
neurofibromas, and café au lait macules. Endocrine abnormalities are 
not  found  in  NF2  and  are  associated  solely  with  NF1.  Pheochromo-
cytomas,  carcinoid  tumors,  and  precocious  puberty  occur  in  ~1% 
of  patients  with  NF1,  and  growth  hormone  deficiency  has  also  been 
reported.  The  features  of  pheochromocytomas  in  NF1  are  similar  to 
those in non-NF1 patients, with 90% of tumors being located within 
the adrenal medulla and the remaining 10% at an extra-adrenal loca-
tion,  which  often  involves  the  para-aortic  region.  Primary  carcinoid 
tumors  are  often  periampullary  and  may  also  occur  in  the  ileum 
but  rarely  in  the  pancreas,  thyroid,  or  lungs.  Hepatic  metastases  are 
associated  with  symptoms  of  the  carcinoid  syndrome,  which  include 
flushing,  diarrhea,  bronchoconstriction,  and  tricuspid  valve  disease. 
Precocious  puberty  is  usually  associated  with  the  extension  of  an 
optic glioma into the hypothalamus with resultant early activation of  
gonadotropin-releasing  hormone  secretion.  Growth  hormone  defi-
ciency  has  also  been  observed  in  some  NF1  patients,  who  may  or 
may not have optic chiasmal gliomas, but it is important to note that 
short stature is frequent in the absence of growth hormone deficiency 
in patients with NF1. The investigation and treatment for tumors are 
similar to those undertaken for each respective tumor type in non-NF1 
patients.

Genetics and Screening  The NF1 gene, which is located on 
chromosome 17q11.2 and acts as a tumor suppressor, consists of 
60 exons that span >350 kb of genomic DNA (Table 388-2). Muta-
tions  in  NF1  are  of  diverse  types  and  are  scattered  throughout  the 
exons. The NF1 gene product is the protein neurofibromin, which has 
homologies to the p120GAP (GTPase activating protein) and acts on 
p21ras by converting the active GTP bound form to its inactive GDP 
form. Mutations of NF1 impair this downregulation of the p21ras sig-
naling pathways, which in turn results in abnormal cell proliferation. 
Screening for the development of pheochromocytomas and carcinoid 
tumors  is  as  described  earlier  for  MEN  2  and  MEN  1,  respectively 
(Tables 388-3 and 388-4).

 ■ CARNEY COMPLEX
Clinical Manifestations  Carney complex (CNC) is an autosomal 
dominant disorder characterized by spotty skin pigmentation (usually 
of  the  face,  labia,  and  conjunctiva),  myxomas  (usually  of  the  eyelids 
and heart, but also the tongue, palate, breast, and skin), psammoma-
tous melanotic schwannomas (usually of the sympathetic nerve chain 
and  upper  gastrointestinal  tract),  and  endocrine  tumors  that  involve 
the adrenals, Sertoli cells, somatotropes, thyroid, and ovary. Cushing’s 
syndrome,  the  result  of  primary  pigmented  nodular  adrenal  disease 
(PPNAD), is the most common endocrine manifestation of CNC and 
may occur in one-third of patients. Patients with CNC and Cushing’s 
syndrome often have an atypical appearance by being thin (as opposed 
to  having  truncal  obesity).  In  addition,  they  may  have  short  stature, 
muscle  and  skin  wasting,  and  osteoporosis.  These  patients  often 
have levels of urinary free cortisol that are normal or increased only 
marginally.  Cortisol  production  may  fluctuate  periodically  with  days 
or  weeks  of  hypercortisolism;  this  pattern  is  referred  to  as  “periodic  
Cushing’s  syndrome.”  Patients  with  Cushing’s  syndrome  usually  have 
loss  of  the  circadian  rhythm  of  cortisol  production.  Acromegaly,  the

2992 result  of  a  somatotrope  tumor,  affects  ~10%  of  patients  with  CNC. 
Testicular tumors may also occur in one-third of patients with CNC. 
These may either be large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors, adrenocor-
tical rests, or Leydig cell tumors. The Sertoli cell tumors occasionally 
may be estrogen-secreting and lead to precocious puberty or gyneco-
mastia. Some patients with CNC have been reported to develop thyroid 
follicular tumors, ovarian cysts, or breast duct adenomas.

Genetics  and  Screening  CNC  type  1  (CNC1)  is  due  to 
mutations of the protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit 1 α 
(R1α) (PRAKAR1A), a tumor suppressor, whose gene is located 
on chromosome 17q.24.2 (Table 388-2). The gene causing CNC type 2 
(CNC2) is located on chromosome 2p16 and has not yet been identi-
fied. It is interesting to note, however, that some tumors do not show 
LOH of 2p16 but instead show genomic instability, suggesting that this 
CNC gene may not be a tumor suppressor. Screening and treatment of 
these  endocrine  tumors  are  similar  to  those  described  earlier  for 
patients with MEN 1 and MEN 2 (Tables 388-3 and 388-4).

 ■ COWDEN’S SYNDROME
Clinical  Manifestations  Multiple  hamartomatous  lesions,  espe-
cially of the skin, mucous membranes (e.g., buccal, intestinal, colonic), 
breast,  and  thyroid,  are  characteristic  of  Cowden’s  syndrome  (CWS), 
which  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder.  Thyroid  abnormalities 
occur in two-thirds of patients with CWS, and these usually consist of 
multinodular goiters or benign adenomas, although <10% of patients 
may have a follicular thyroid carcinoma. Breast abnormalities occur in 
>75% of patients and consist of either fibrocystic disease or adenocar-
cinomas. The investigation and treatment for CWS tumors are similar 
to those undertaken for non-CWS patients.

Genetics  and  Screening  CWS  is  genetically  heterogenous, 
and seven types (CWS1–7) are recognized (Table 388-2). CWS1 is 
due to mutations of the phosphate and tensin homologue deleted 
on  chromosome  10  (PTEN)  gene,  located  on  chromosome  10q23.31. 
CWS2 is caused by mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit 
B (SDHB) gene, located on chromosome 1p36.13; and CWS3 is caused 
by  mutations  of  the  SDHD  gene,  located  on  chromosome  11q13.1. 
SDHB and SDHD mutations are also associated with pheochromocy-
toma. CWS4 is caused by hypermethylation of the Killin (KLLN) gene, 
the promoter of which shares the same transcription site as PTEN on 
chromosome 10q23.31. CWS5 is caused by mutations of the phosphat-
idylinositol  3-kinase  catalytic  alpha  (PIK3CA)  gene  on  chromosome 
3q26.32. CWS6 is caused by mutations of the V-Akt murine thymoma 
viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) gene on chromosome 14q32.33, and 
CWS7 is caused by mutations of the saccharomyces cerevisiae homol-
ogy of B (SEC23B) gene on chromosome 20p11.23. Screening for thy-
roid  abnormalities  entails  neck  ultrasonography  and  fine-needle 
aspiration with analysis of cell cytology.

 ■ MCCUNE-ALBRIGHT SYNDROME  
(SEE ALSO CHAP. 412)
Clinical  Manifestations  McCune-Albright  syndrome  (MAS)  is 
characterized  by  the  triad  of  polyostotic  fibrous  dysplasia,  which 
may  be  associated  with  hypophosphatemic  rickets;  café  au  lait  skin 
pigmentation;  and  peripheral  precocious  puberty.  Other  endocrine 
abnormalities  include  thyrotoxicosis,  which  may  be  associated  with 
a  multinodular  goiter,  somatotrope  tumors,  and  Cushing’s  syndrome 
(due  to  adrenal  tumors).  Investigation  and  treatment  for  each  endo-
crinopathy are similar to those used in patients without MAS.

Genetics  and  Screening  MAS  is  a  disorder  of  mosaicism 
that results from postzygotic somatic cell mutations of the G pro-
tein  α-stimulating  subunit  (Gsα),  encoded  by  the  GNAS1  gene, 
located  on  chromosome  20q13.32  (Table  388-2).  The  Gsα  mutations, 
which include Arg201Cys, Arg201His, Glu227Arg, or Glu227His, are 
activating and are found only in cells of the abnormal tissues. Screening 
for  hyperfunction  of  relevant  endocrine  glands  and  development  of 
hypophosphatemia,  which  may  be  associated  with  elevated  serum 

fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) concentrations, is undertaken in 
MAS patients.

389 Autoimmune  

Polyendocrine Syndromes
Peter A. Gottlieb, Aaron W. Michels

Polyglandular  deficiency  syndromes  have  been  given  many  different 
names, reflecting the wide spectrum of disorders that have been asso-
ciated  with  these  syndromes  and  the  heterogeneity  of  their  clinical 
presentations. The name used in this chapter for this group of disor-
ders  is  autoimmune  polyendocrine  syndrome  (APS).  In  general,  these 
disorders  are  divided  into  two  major  categories,  APS  type  1  (APS-1) 
and APS type 2 (APS-2). Some groups have further subdivided APS-2 
into  APS  type  3  (APS-3)  and  APS  type  4  (APS-4)  depending  on  the 
type of autoimmunity involved. For the most part, this additional clas-
sification does not clarify our understanding of disease pathogenesis 
or  prevention  of  complications  in  individual  patients.  Importantly, 
there are many nonendocrine disease associations included in these 
syndromes, suggesting that although the underlying autoimmune dis-
order  predominantly  involves  endocrine  targets,  it  does  not  exclude 
other  tissues.  The  disease  associations  found  in  APS-1  and  APS-2 
are summarized in Table 389-1. Understanding these syndromes and 
their disease manifestations can lead to early diagnosis and treatment 
of additional disorders in patients and their family members.
 ■ APS-1
APS-1 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 240300) has also 
been  called  autoimmune  polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal

dystrophy  (APECED).  Mucocutaneous  candidiasis,  hypoparathyroid-
ism,  and  Addison’s  disease  form  the  three  major  components  of  this 
disorder. However, as summarized in Table 389-1, many other organ 
systems  can  be  involved  over  time.  APS-1  is  rare,  with  <500  cases 
reported in the literature.

The  classical  form  of  APS-1  is  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder 
caused  by  mutations  in  the  AIRE  gene  (autoimmune  regulator  gene) 
found on chromosome 21. This gene is most highly expressed in thy-
mic medullary epithelial cells (mTECs) where it controls the expression 
of tissue-specific self-antigens (e.g., insulin). Deletion of this regulator 
leads  to  decreased  expression  of  tissue-specific  self-antigens  and  is 
hypothesized  to  allow  autoreactive  T  cells  to  avoid  central  deletion, 
which  normally  occurs  during  T-cell  maturation  in  the  thymus.  The 
AIRE  gene  is  also  expressed  in  epithelial  cells  found  in  peripheral 
lymphoid organs, but its role in these extrathymic cells remains con-
troversial. To date, >100 mutations have been described in this gene, 
and  there  is  a  higher  frequency  within  certain  ethnic  groups  includ-
ing  Iranian  Jews,  Sardinians,  Finns,  Norwegians,  and  Irish.  Recently, 
several  autosomal  dominant  mutations  have  been  identified  and  are 
localized primarily in the PHD1 domain of the AIRE gene, rather than 
the CARD region, where the autosomal recessive mutations have been 
found.  Individuals  with  this  nonclassical  form  of  APS-1  may  have  a 
later  onset  of  symptoms  and  less  aggressive  disease,  without  the  full 
spectrum of autoimmune components being expressed.

antigen; IL, interleukin.

Clinical  Manifestations  Classical  APS-1  develops  very  early  in 
life, often in infancy (Table 389-2). Chronic mucocutaneous candid-
iasis without signs of systemic disease is often the first manifestation. 
It  affects  the  mouth  and  nails  more  frequently  than  the  skin  and 
esophagus.  Chronic  oral  candidiasis  can  result  in  atrophic  disease 
with areas suggestive of leukoplakia, which can pose a risk for future 
carcinoma. The etiology is associated with anticytokine autoantibodies 
(anti-interleukin [IL] 17A, IL-17F, and IL-22) related to T helper (TH) 
17 T cells and depressed production of these cytokines by peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells. Hypoparathyroidism usually develops next, 
followed by adrenal insufficiency. The time from development of one 
component of the disorder to the next can be many years, and the order 
of disease appearance is variable.

Chronic candidiasis is nearly always present and is not very respon-
sive to treatment. Hypoparathyroidism is found in >85% of cases, and 
Addison’s  disease  is  found  in  nearly  80%.  Gonadal  failure  appears  to 
affect women more than men (70 vs 25%, respectively), and hypoplasia 
of  the  dental  enamel  also  occurs  frequently  (77%  of  patients).  Other 
endocrine  disorders  that  occur  less  frequently  include  type  1  dia-
betes  (23%)  and  autoimmune  thyroid  disease  (18%).  Nonendocrine 
manifestations  that  present  less  frequently  include  alopecia  (40%), 
vitiligo  (26%),  intestinal  malabsorption  (18%),  pernicious  anemia 
(31%), chronic active hepatitis (17%), and nail dystrophy. An unusual 
and  debilitating  manifestation  of  the  disorder  is  the  development  of 
refractory  diarrhea/obstipation  that  may  be  related  to  autoantibody-
mediated  destruction  of  enterochromaffin  or  enterochromaffin-like 
cells. The incidence rates for many of these disorders peak in the first or 
second decade of life, but the individual disease components continue 
to emerge over time. Therefore, prevalence rates may be higher than 
originally reported.

Diagnosis  The diagnosis of APS-1 is usually made clinically when 
two of the three major component disorders are found in an individ-
ual  patient.  Siblings  of  individuals  with  APS-1  should  be  considered 
affected even if only one component disorder has been detected due to 
the known inheritance of the syndrome. Genetic analysis of the AIRE 
gene  should  be  undertaken  to  identify  mutations.  Detection  of  anti–
interferon α and anti–interferon ω antibodies can identify nearly 100% 
of cases with APS-1. The autoantibody arises independent of the type of 
AIRE gene mutation and is not found in other autoimmune disorders.

Diagnosis of each underlying disorder should be done based on their 
typical  clinical  presentations  (Table  389-3).  Mucocutaneous  candid-
iasis  may  present  throughout  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  and  it  may  be 
detected in the oral mucosa or from stool samples. Evaluation by a gas-
troenterologist to examine the esophagus for candidiasis or secondary 
stricture  may  be  merited  based  on  symptoms.  Other  gastrointestinal

should be considered as signs of development of component disorders.
The  development  of  disease-specific  autoantibody  assays  can  help 
confirm  disease  and  also  detect  risk  for  future  disease.  For  example, 
where possible, detection of anticytokine antibodies to IL-17 and IL-22 
would confirm the diagnosis of mucocutaneous candidiasis due to APS-1. 
The  presence  of  anti-21-hydroxylase  antibody  or  anti-17-hydroxylase 
antibody  (which  may  be  found  more  commonly  in  adrenal  insuffi-
ciency associated with APS-1) would confirm the presence or risk for 
Addison’s disease. Other autoantibodies found in type 1 diabetes (e.g., 

anti-GAD65),  pernicious  anemia,  and  other  component  conditions 
should  be  screened  for  on  a  regular  basis  (6-  to  12-month  intervals 
depending on the age of the subject).

Laboratory tests, including a complete metabolic panel, phosphorous 
and  magnesium,  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  (TSH),  adrenocortico-
tropic hormone (ACTH; morning), hemoglobin A1c, plasma vitamin B12 
level,  and  complete  blood  count  with  peripheral  smear  looking  for 
Howell-Jolly  bodies  (asplenism),  should  also  be  performed  at  these 
time  points.  Detection  of  abnormal  physical  findings  or  test  results 
should prompt subsequent examinations of the relevant organ system 
(e.g., presence of Howell-Jolly bodies indicates need for ultrasound of 
spleen).

TREATMENT
APS-1
Therapy of individual disease components is carried out as outlined 
in  other  relevant  chapters.  Replacement  of  deficient  hormones 
(e.g., adrenal, pancreas, ovaries/testes) will treat most of the endo-
crinopathies  noted.  Several  unique  issues  merit  special  emphasis. 
Adrenal  insufficiency  can  be  masked  by  primary  hypothyroidism 
by prolonging the half-life of cortisol. The caveat therefore is that 
replacement  therapy  with  thyroid  hormone  can  precipitate  an 
adrenal  crisis  in  an  undiagnosed  individual.  Hence,  all  patients 
with hypothyroidism and the possibility of APS should be screened 
for  adrenal  insufficiency  to  allow  treatment  with  glucocorticoids 
prior to the initiation of thyroid hormone replacement. Treatment of 
mucocutaneous candidiasis with ketoconazole in an individual with 
subclinical adrenal insufficiency may also precipitate adrenal crisis. 
Furthermore,  mucocutaneous  candidiasis  may  be  difficult  to  erad-
icate entirely. Severe cases of disease involvement may require sys-
temic immunomodulatory therapy, but this is not commonly needed.

 ■ APS-2
APS-2  (OMIM  269200)  is  more  common  than  APS-1,  with  a  preva-
lence of 1–2 in 100,000. It has a gender bias and occurs more often in 
female patients, with a ratio of at least 3:1 compared to male patients. 
In contrast to APS-1, APS-2 often has its onset in adulthood, with a 
peak  incidence  between  20  and  60  years  of  age.  It  shows  a  familial, 
multigenerational heritage (Table 389-2). The presence of two or more 
of  the  following  endocrine  deficiencies  in  the  same  patient  defines 
the  presence  of  APS-2:  primary  adrenal  insufficiency  (Addison’s  dis-
ease;  50–70%),  Graves’  disease  or  autoimmune  thyroiditis  (15–69%), 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D; 40–50%), and primary hypogonadism. 
Frequently  associated  autoimmune  conditions  include  celiac  disease 
(3–15%), myasthenia gravis, vitiligo, alopecia, serositis, and pernicious 
anemia. These conditions occur with increased frequency in affected 
patients but are also are found in their family members (Table 389-3).

Genetic  Considerations  The  overwhelming  risk  factor  for 
APS-2  has  been  localized  to  the  genes  in  the  human  lymphocyte 
antigen (HLA) complex on chromosome 6. Primary adrenal insuffi-
ciency  in  APS-2,  but  not  APS-1,  is  strongly  associated  with  both 
HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4. Other class I and class II genes and alleles, 
such  as  HLA-B8,  HLA-DQ2  and  HLA-DQ8,  and  HLA-DR  subtypes 
such as DRB1*04:04, appear to contribute to organ-specific disease sus-
ceptibility (Table 389-4). HLA-B8- and HLA-DR3-associated illnesses 
include  selective  IgA  deficiency,  juvenile  dermatomyositis,  dermatitis 
herpetiformis,  alopecia,  scleroderma,  autoimmune  thrombocytopenia 
purpura, hypophysitis, metaphyseal osteopenia, and serositis.

Several  other  immune  genes  have  been  proposed  to  be  associated 
with  Addison’s  disease  and  therefore  with  APS-2  (Table  389-3).  The 
“5.1”  allele  of  a  major  histocompatibility  complex  (MHC)  gene  is  an 
atypical class I HLA molecule MIC-A. The MIC-A5.1 allele has a very 
strong  association  with  Addison’s  disease  that  is  not  accounted  for 
by  linkage  disequilibrium  with  DR3  or  DR4.  Its  role  is  complicated 
because certain HLA class I genes can offset this effect. PTPN22 codes 
for a polymorphism in a protein tyrosine phosphatase, which acts on

Screening tests for thyroid disease can 
include  anti–thyroid  peroxidase  (TPO) 
or  anti-thyroglobulin  autoantibodies  or 
anti-TSH receptor antibodies for Graves’ 
disease. Yearly measurements of TSH can 
then  be  used  to  follow  these  individu-
als.  Celiac  disease  can  be  screened  for 
using  the  anti–tissue  transglutaminase 
(tTg)  antibody  test.  For  those  <20  years 
of age, testing every 1–2 years should be 
performed,  whereas  less  frequent  testing 
is  indicated  after  the  age  of  20  because 
the  majority  of  individuals  who  develop 
celiac  disease  have  the  antibody  earlier 
in  life.  Positive  tTg  antibody  test  results 
should  be  confirmed  on  repeat  testing, 
followed by small-bowel biopsy to docu-
ment pathologic changes of celiac disease. Many patients have asymp-
tomatic  celiac  disease  that  is  nevertheless  associated  with  osteopenia 
and impaired growth. If left untreated, symptomatic celiac disease has 
been reported to be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal 
malignancy, especially lymphoma, and osteoporosis later in life.

Pituitary, Pit-1

The knowledge of the particular disease associations should guide 
other autoantibody or laboratory testing. A complete history and phys-
ical examination should be performed every 1–3 years including CBC, 
metabolic panel, TSH, and vitamin B12 levels to screen for most of the 
possible abnormalities. More specific tests should be based on specific 
findings from the history and physical examination.

TREATMENT
APS-2

With  the  exception  of  Graves’  disease,  the  management  of  each 
endocrine component of APS-2 involves hormone replacement and 
is covered in detail in the chapters on adrenal (Chap. 386), thyroid 
(Chap. 382), gonadal (Chaps. 391 and 392), and parathyroid dis-
eases (Chap. 410). As noted for APS-1, adrenal insufficiency can be 
masked by primary hypothyroidism and should be considered and 
treated as discussed above. In patients with T1D, decreasing insulin 
requirements or hypoglycemia, without obvious secondary causes, 
may indicate the emergence of adrenal insufficiency. Hypocalcemia 
in APS-2 patients is more likely due to malabsorption, potentially 
from undiagnosed celiac disease, than hypoparathyroidism.

Immunotherapy  for  autoimmune  endocrine  disease  has  been 
reserved for T1D, for the most part, reflecting the lifetime burden of 
the disease for the individual patient and society. Although several 
immunotherapies  (e.g.,  modified  anti-CD3,  rituximab,  abatacept, 
alefacept, low-dose antithymocyte globulin) can prolong the hon-
eymoon phase of T1D, none has achieved long-term success. The 
anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (teplizumab) does delay the onset 
of clinical diabetes by an average of 2 years when administered to 
individuals with stage 2 T1D (e.g., those with autoantibodies and 

intracellular signaling pathways in both T and B lymphocytes. It has 
been implicated in T1D, Addison’s disease, and other autoimmune con-
ditions. CTLA4 is a receptor on the T-cell surface that modulates the 
activation state of the cell as part of the signal 2 pathway (i.e., binding 
to CD80/86 on antigen presenting cells). Polymorphisms of this gene 
appear  to  cause  downregulation  of  the  cell  surface  expression  of  the 
receptor, leading to decreased T-cell activation and proliferation. This 
appears to contribute to Addison’s disease and potentially other com-
ponents of APS-2. Allelic variants of the IL-2Rα are linked to develop-
ment of T1D and autoimmune thyroid disease and could contribute to 
the phenotype of APS-2 in certain individuals.

Diagnosis  When  one  of  the  component  disorders  is  present,  a 
second associated disorder occurs more commonly than in the general 
population (Table 389-3). There is controversy as to which tests to use 
and how often to screen individuals for disease. A strong family history 
of autoimmunity should raise suspicion in an individual with an initial 
component diagnosis. The development of a rarer form of autoimmu-
nity, such as Addison’s disease, should prompt more extensive screen-
ing  for  other  linked  disorders,  as  ~50%  of  Addison’s  disease  patients 
develop another autoimmune disease during their lifetime.

Circulating  autoantibodies,  as  previously  discussed,  can  precede 
the  development  of  clinical  disease  by  many  years  but  would  allow 
the clinician to follow the patient and identify the disease onset at its 
earliest  time  point  (Tables  389-3  and  389-4).  For  each  of  the  endo-
crine components of the disorder, appropriate autoantibody assays are 
listed  and,  if  positive,  should  prompt  physiologic  testing  to  diagnose 
clinical  or  subclinical  disease.  For  Addison’s  disease,  antibodies  to 
21-hydroxylase  antibodies  are  highly  diagnostic  for  risk  of  adrenal 
insufficiency.  However,  individuals  may  take  many  years  to  develop 
overt symptoms of hypoadrenalism. Screening of 21-hydroxylase anti-
body–positive patients can be performed measuring morning ACTH 
and cortisol on a yearly basis. Rising ACTH values over time or low 
morning  cortisol  in  association  with  signs  or  symptoms  of  adrenal 
insufficiency  should  prompt  testing  via  the  cosyntropin  stimulation 
test (Chap. 386). T1D can be screened for by measuring autoantibodies

impaired  glucose  tolerance).  Active  basic  and  clinical  research 
using  new  approaches  and  combination  therapy  may  change  the 
treatment of this disease or other autoimmune conditions that share 
similar pathways.

 ■ IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITOR–INDUCED 
ENDOCRINE AUTOIMMUNITY
Therapies  that  block  immune  checkpoints,  such  as  programmed 
cell death protein 1 (PD-1), its ligand (PD-L1), or CTLA-4, are ben-
eficial  immunotherapies  for  many  advanced-stage  cancers.  These 
immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  (ICIs)  block  negative  immune  regula-
tion, thereby allowing for an immune response directed against tumor 
cells.  However,  immune-related  adverse  events  also  occur,  especially 
autoimmunity directed toward self-tissues. ICI-induced T1D, thyroid 
disease, hypophysitis, and adrenal insufficiency have all been reported 
with these therapies. Hypothyroidism occurs in ~8% and T1D in 1% 
of  those  receiving  monoclonal  antibodies  directed  against  PD-1  or 
PD-L1,  and  hypophysitis  and  adrenal  insufficiency  occur  in  <1%  of 
treated  patients.  These  autoimmune  side  effects  can  develop  during 
or  after  therapy,  mostly  within  a  few  weeks  to  months  following  the 
start of therapy. ICI-induced T1D has a very rapid onset, presents with 
diabetic  ketoacidosis,  is  permanent,  and  requires  lifelong  exogenous 
insulin  therapy  for  treatment.  There  is  a  genetic  association  with 
HLA-DR4 and islet autoantibodies in ~40–50% of patients at diagnosis. 
The  pathogenesis  is  immune  mediated  as  T  lymphocyte  infiltration 
has been documented in the pancreatic islets of an ICI-T1D patient. 
Determining  the  mechanisms  of  autoimmune  disease  development 
following ICI therapies and developing biomarkers to stratify risk for 
autoimmune side effects prior to therapy are active areas of research.

 ■ IPEX
Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked 
disease  (IPEX;  OMIM  304790)  is  a  rare  X-linked  recessive  disor-
der.  The  disease  onset  is  in  infancy  and  is  characterized  by  severe 
enteropathy,  T1D,  and  skin  disease,  as  well  as  variable  association 
with  several  other  autoimmune  disorders.  Many  infants  die  within 
the  first  days  of  life,  but  the  course  is  variable,  with  some  chil-
dren  surviving  for  12–15  years.  Early  onset  of  T1D,  often  at  birth, 
is  highly  suggestive  of  the  diagnosis  because  nearly  80%  of  IPEX 
patients develop T1D. Although treatment of the individual disorders 
can  temporarily  improve  the  situation,  treatment  of  the  underlying 
immune  deficiency  is  required  and  includes  immunosuppressive 
therapy generally followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Transplantation is the only life-saving form of therapy and can be fully 
curative by normalizing the imbalanced immune system found in this  
disorder.

IPEX  is  caused  by  mutations  in  the  FOXP3  gene,  which  is  also 
mutated  in  the  Scurfy  mouse,  an  animal  model  that  shares  much  of 
the same phenotype of IPEX patients. The FOXP3 transcription factor 
is  expressed  in  regulatory  T  cells  designated  CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ 
(Treg).  Lack  of  this  factor  causes  a  profound  deficiency  of  this  Treg 
population  and  results  in  rampant  autoimmunity  due  to  the  lack  of 
peripheral tolerance normally provided by these cells. Certain muta-
tions  may  lead  to  varying  forms  of  expression  of  the  full  syndrome, 
and there are rare cases where the FOXP3 gene is intact but other genes 
involved in this pathway (e.g., CD25, IL-2Rα) may be causative. Future 
therapy with autologous CD4+ T cells transfected with a functioning 
FOXP3 gene may offer a better long-term outcome than has been seen 
in those treated with stem cell transplantation.

 ■ THYMIC TUMORS
Thymomas  and  thymic  hyperplasia  are  associated  with  several  auto-
immune  diseases,  with  the  most  common  being  myasthenia  gravis 
(44%) and red cell aplasia (20%). Graves’ disease, T1D, and Addison’s 
disease  may  also  be  associated  with  thymic  tumors.  Patients  with 
myasthenia gravis and thymoma may have unique anti–acetylcholine 
receptor autoantibodies. Most thymomas lack AIRE expression within 
the thymoma, and this could be a potential factor in the development 

of  autoimmunity.  In  support  of  this  concept,  thymoma  is  the  one 
other disease with “frequent” development of anticytokine antibodies 
and mucocutaneous candidiasis in adults. The majority of tumors are 
malignant,  and  temporary  remissions  of  the  autoimmune  condition 
can occur with resection of the tumor.

 ■ ANTI-INSULIN RECEPTOR ANTIBODIES
This is a very rare disorder where severe insulin resistance (type B) is 
caused by the presence of anti-insulin receptor antibodies. It is associ-
ated with acanthosis nigricans, which can also be associated with other 
forms  of  less  severe  insulin  resistance.  About  one-third  of  patients 
have an associated autoimmune illness such as systemic lupus erythe-
matosus or Sjögren’s syndrome. Therefore, the presence of antinuclear 
antibodies,  elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate,  hyperglobuline-
mia, leukopenia, and hypocomplementemia may accompany the pre-
sentation.  The  presence  of  anti-insulin  receptor  autoantibodies  leads 
to marked insulin resistance, requiring >100,000 units of insulin to be 
given daily with only partial control of hyperglycemia. Patients can also 
have severe hypoglycemia due to partial activation of the insulin recep-
tor by the antibody. The course of the disease is variable, and several 
patients have had spontaneous remissions. A therapeutic approach that 
targets  B  lymphocytes,  including  rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  and 
pulse steroids, has been validated in follow-on case reports to induce 
remission of the disease.

 ■ INSULIN AUTOIMMUNE SYNDROME  
(HIRATA’S SYNDROME)
The insulin autoimmune syndrome, associated with Graves’ disease and 
methimazole therapy (or other sulfhydryl-containing medications), is 
of particular interest due to a remarkably strong association with a spe-
cific HLA haplotype. Such patients with elevated titers of anti-insulin 
antibodies frequently present with hypoglycemia. In Japan, the disease 
is restricted to HLA-DR4-positive individuals with DRB1*04:06, while 
Caucasian patients predominantly have DRB1*04:03 (which is related 
to DRB1*04:06). In Hirata’s syndrome, the anti-insulin antibodies are 
often  polyclonal.  Discontinuation  of  the  medication  generally  leads 
to resolution of the syndrome over time. There are very rare cases of 
insulin autoimmune syndrome not associated with sulfhydryl-containing 
medications  that  result  in  profound,  life-threatening  hypoglycemia. 
Treatment involves treating the underlying condition that causes anti-
insulin  antibodies,  such  as  a  B  lymphocyte  lymphoma  (tend  to  have 
monoclonal  insulin  antibodies)  or  systemic  lupus  erythematosus.  As 
hypoglycemia is profound when elevated titers of high affinity insulin 
antibodies  bind  secreted  insulin  and  then  release  it  into  circulation, 
treatment that begins with high-dose glucocorticoids and rituximab to 
target B lymphocytes has been shown to be effective.

 ■ POEMS SYNDROME
POEMS  (polyneuropathy,  organomegaly,  endocrinopathy,  M-protein, 
and  skin  changes;  also  known  as  Crow-Fukase  syndrome;  OMIM 
192240)  patients  usually  present  with  a  progressive  sensorimotor 
polyneuropathy,  diabetes  mellitus  (50%),  primary  gonadal  failure 
(70%),  and  a  plasma  cell  dyscrasia  with  sclerotic  bony  lesions.  Asso-
ciated  findings  can  be  hepatosplenomegaly,  lymphadenopathy,  and 
hyperpigmentation. Patients often present in the fifth to sixth decade 
of  life  and  have  a  median  survival  after  diagnosis  of  <3  years.  The 
syndrome  is  assumed  to  be  secondary  to  circulating  immunoglob-
ulins,  but  patients  have  excess  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  as 
well as elevated levels of other inflammatory cytokines such as IL1-β, 
IL-6,  and  tumor  necrosis  factor  α.  Patients  have  been  treated  with 
thalidomide, and more recently lenalidomide, leading to a decrease in 
vascular endothelial growth factor. Hyperglycemia responds to small, 
subcutaneous doses of insulin. The hypogonadism is due to primary 
gonadal disease with elevated plasma levels of follicle-stimulating hor-
mone and luteinizing hormone. Temporary resolution of the features 
of POEMS, including normalization of blood glucose, may occur after 
radiotherapy for localized plasma cell lesions of bone or after chemo-
therapy,  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone,  or  autologous  stem  cell 
transplantation.

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolism ■ OTHER DISORDERS
Other  diseases  can  exhibit  polyendocrine  deficiencies,  including 
Kearns-Sayre  syndrome,  DIDMOAD  syndrome  (diabetes  insipidus, 
diabetes mellitus, progressive bilateral optic atrophy, and sensorineural 
deafness; also termed Wolfram’s syndrome), Down’s syndrome or tri-
somy 21 (OMIM 190685), Turner’s syndrome (monosomy X, 45,X0), 
and congenital rubella.

Kearns-Sayre  syndrome  (OMIM  530000)  is  a  rare  mitochondrial 
DNA  disorder  characterized  by  myopathic  abnormalities  leading  to 
ophthalmoplegia  and  progressive  weakness  in  association  with  sev-
eral endocrine abnormalities, including hypoparathyroidism, primary 
gonadal  failure,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  hypopituitarism.  Crystalline 
mitochondrial inclusions are found in muscle biopsy specimens, and 
such inclusions have also been observed in the cerebellum. Antipara-
thyroid antibodies have not been described; however, antibodies to the 
anterior pituitary gland and striated muscle have been identified, and 
the disease may have autoimmune components. These mitochondrial 
DNA mutations occur sporadically and do not appear to be associated 
with a familial syndrome.

Wolfram’s  syndrome  (OMIM  222300,  chromosome  4;  OMIM 
598500,  mitochondrial)  is  a  rare  autosomal  recessive  disease  that  is 
also  called  DIDMOAD.  Neurologic  and  psychiatric  disturbances  are 
prominent in most patients and can cause severe disability. The disease 
is caused by defects in the Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1) gene, which 
encodes a 100-kDa transmembrane protein that has been localized to 
the endoplasmic reticulum and is found in neuronal and neuroendo-
crine tissue. Its expression induces ion channel activity with a resultant 
increase  in  intracellular  calcium  and  may  play  an  important  role  in 
intracellular calcium homeostasis. Wolfram’s syndrome appears to be 
a  slowly  progressive  neurodegenerative  process,  and  there  is  nonau-
toimmune  selective  destruction  of  the  pancreatic  beta  cells.  Diabetes 
mellitus with an onset in childhood is usually the first manifestation. 
Diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy are present in all reported cases, 
but  expression  of  the  other  features  is  variable.  Treatments  targeting 
endoplasmic  reticulum  dysfunction  are  being  tested  and  may  be  a 
bridge until gene therapy can be developed to treat the most severely 
affected cases.

Down’s syndrome, or trisomy 21 (OMIM 190685), is associated with 
the development of T1D, thyroiditis, and celiac disease. Patients with 
Turner’s  syndrome  also  appear  to  be  at  increased  risk  for  the  devel-
opment  of  thyroid  disease  and  celiac  disease.  It  is  recommended  to 
screen patients with trisomy 21 and Turner’s syndrome for associated 
autoimmune diseases on a regular basis.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Identification of these syndromes requires access to central laborato-
ries with the ability to detect unique autoantibodies and to sequence 
the specific genes that may underlie these disorders. Early recognition 
of  the  clinical  features  of  these  disorders  and  timely  referral  and/or 
consultation  with  tertiary  care  centers  to  confirm  the  diagnosis  and 
initiate  therapy  are  important  to  improving  outcomes.  The  AIRE 
recessive gene mutations found in APS-1 were originally described in 
high  frequency  in  several  populations  including  Finns,  Iranian  Jews, 
Sardinians,  Norwegians,  and  Irish.  Although  individuals  from  many 
other countries have now been found to have these mutations and the 
newly  identified  dominant  AIRE  gene  mutations,  understanding  the 
frequency in the background population may raise the clinician’s level 
of suspicion for these rare disorders. Hirata’s syndrome was originally 
reported in Japanese populations but also may be found in other pop-
ulations, as noted.

390 Sex Development

Courtney Finlayson, J. Larry Jameson, 
John C. Achermann

Sex development begins in utero but continues into young adulthood 
with the achievement of sexual maturity and reproductive capability. 
The major determinants of sex development can be divided into three 
components: chromosomal sex, gonadal sex (sex determination), and 
phenotypic  sex  (sex  differentiation)  (Fig.  390-1).  Variations  at  each 
of these stages can result in differences (or disorders) of sex develop-
ment (DSDs) (Table 390-1). In the newborn period, ~1 in 5000 babies 
undergo  investigation  because  of  atypical  or  ambiguous  genitalia. 
Urgent assessment is indicated, because some causes such as congeni-
tal adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) can be associated with life-threatening 
adrenal crises. An experienced multidisciplinary team is important for 
counseling, planning appropriate investigations, discussing long-term 
well-being,  supporting  parents,  and  providing  clear  communication 
about the diagnosis and management options. DSDs can also present at 
other ages and to a range of health professionals (Table 390-2). Subtler 
forms of gonadal dysfunction (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome [KS], Turner 
syndrome [TS]) often are diagnosed later in life by internists. Because 
DSDs are associated with a variety of psychological, reproductive, and 
potential medical consequences, an open dialogue must be established 
between  the  patient  and  health  care  providers  to  ensure  continuity 
and attention to these issues across the life span. Gender variance and 
gender  dysphoria  are  more  common  among  some  individuals  with 
DSD  than  in  the  general  population.  Thus,  attention  to  and  comfort 
discussing  gender  identity  is  important.  Support  groups  also  have  a 
valuable role to play for many patients and families.

Care of individuals with DSDs has evolved from primarily focusing 
on  medical  and  surgical  intervention  to  “genitalia”  to  a  more  holistic 
approach involving medical, surgical, and psychosocial care, acknowl-
edging that the best way to care for individuals with DSD is not always 
clear  and  should  be  individualized.  This  includes  many  controversies, 
particularly concerning whether genitoplasty or prophylactic gonadec-
tomy in selected conditions should be performed for infants and young 
children  prior  to  the  age  of  consent.  Accepted  nomenclature  is  also 
controversial. Previous terms such as intersex and hermaphrodite were

SEX DEVELOPMENT
Chromosomal  sex,  defined  by  a  karyotype,  describes  the  X  and/or  Y 
chromosome  complement  (46,XY;  46,XX)  established  at  the  time  of 
fertilization.  The  presence  of  a  normal  Y  chromosome  determines 

that testis development will occur even in the presence of multiple X 
chromosomes (e.g., 47,XXY). Loss of an X chromosome impairs gonad 
development (45,X or 45,X/46,XY mosaicism). Fetuses with no X chro-
mosome (45,Y) are not viable.

Gonadal  sex  refers  to  the  histologic  and  functional  characteristics 
of  gonadal  tissue  as  testis  or  ovary.  The  embryonic  gonad  is  initially 
“bipotential”  and  can  develop  (from  ~42  days  after  conception)  into

either a testis or an ovary (Fig. 390-2). Testis development is initiated 
by expression of the gene SRY (sex-determining region on the Y chro-
mosome).  Disruption  of  SRY  prevents  testis  development  in  46,XY 
individuals, whereas translocation of SRY in 46,XX individuals induces 
testis  development  and  a  male  phenotype.  The  main  target  of  SRY 
is  SOX9  (SRY-related  HMG-box  gene  9).  SOX9  is  upregulated  in  the 
developing testis but is suppressed in the ovary. Many other genes are 
involved in testis development, including in Sertoli cell maturation and 
Leydig cell differentiation/steroidogenesis. In addition to transcription 
factors, these genes encode an array of signaling molecules and para-
crine growth factors, some of which influence other organ systems. For 
example, WT1 (Wilms’ tumor–related gene 1) acts early in the genetic 
pathway and also regulates kidney development, whereas steroidogenic 
factor 1 (SF1, NR5A1) influences both gonad and adrenal development. 
Pathogenic variants causing loss of function of SF1 are found in ~10% 
of XY patients with gonadal dysgenesis and impaired androgenization. 
Of  note,  duplication  of  a  related  gene  DAX1/NR0B1  impairs  testis 
development, revealing the exquisite sensitivity of the testis-determining 
pathway to gene dosage effects.

Although  ovarian  development  once  was  considered  a  “default” 
genetic pathway, it is now clear that specific genes are expressed during 
the  earliest  stages  of  ovary  development.  Some  of  these  factors  may 
repress  testis  development  (e.g.,  WNT4,  R-spondin-1)  (Fig.  390-2). 
Once the ovary has formed, additional factors are required for normal 
follicular development (e.g., follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] recep-
tor). Steroidogenesis in the ovary requires the development of follicles 
that  contain  granulosa  cells  and  theca  cells  surrounding  the  oocytes 
(Chap.  392).  Thus,  there  is  relatively  limited  ovarian  steroidogenesis 
until puberty.

Germ cells also develop in a sex dimorphic manner. In the develop-
ing ovary, primordial germ cells (PGCs) proliferate and enter meiosis, 
whereas they proliferate and then undergo mitotic arrest in the devel-
oping testis. PGC entry into meiosis is potentially initiated by retinoic 
acid.  The  developing  testis  produces  high  levels  of  CYP26B1,  an 
enzyme that degrades retinoic acid, preventing PGC entry into meiosis. 
Approximately 7 million germ cells are present in the fetal ovary in the 
second trimester, and 1 million remain at birth. Only 400 are ovulated 
during a woman’s reproductive life span (Chap. 392).

Phenotypic sex refers to the structures of the external and internal 
genitalia and secondary sex characteristics. In addition to bipotential

gonads in the fetuses, they also initially possess internal and external 
genitalia, which can develop along a male- or female-typical pathway, 
with sex-specific development occurring as a result of hormone action 
(Fig.  390-3).  The  developing  testis  releases  anti-müllerian  hormone 
(AMH;  also  known  as  müllerian-inhibiting  substance  [MIS])  from 
Sertoli  cells  and  testosterone  from  Leydig  cells.  AMH  acts  through 
specific receptors to cause regression of the müllerian structures from 
60–80  days  after  conception.  At  ~60–140  days  after  conception,  tes-
tosterone  supports  the  maintenance  of  wolffian  structures,  including 
the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles. Testosterone is 
the precursor for dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent androgen that 
promotes  development  of  the  external  genitalia,  including  the  penis 
and scrotum (60–100 days, and thereafter) (Fig. 390-3). The urogenital 
sinus develops into the prostate and prostatic urethra in the male and 
into  the  urethra  and  lower  portion  of  the  vagina  in  the  female.  The 
genital  tubercle  becomes  the  glans  penis  in  the  male  and  the  clitoris 
in the female. The urogenital swellings form the scrotum or the labia 
majora, and the urethral folds fuse to form the shaft of the penis and 
the  male  urethra  or  the  labia  minora.  In  the  female,  wolffian  ducts 
regress and the müllerian ducts form the fallopian tubes, uterus, and 
upper segment of the vagina. A female phenotype will develop in the 
absence  of  the  gonad,  but  estrogen  is  needed  for  maturation  of  the 
uterus and breast at puberty.

The  prenatal  hormone  environment  is  likely  one  of  many  factors 
influencing aspects of gender identity and behavior. This is an area of 
ongoing research and is beyond the scope of this chapter.

DISORDERS OF CHROMOSOMAL SEX
Variations  in  sex  chromosome  number  and  structure  can  present  as 
DSDs  (e.g.,  45,X/46,XY).  KS  (47,XXY)  and  TS  (45,X)  do  not  usually 
present  with  genital  ambiguity  but  are  associated  with  gonadal  dys-
function (Table 390-3).
 ■ KLINEFELTER SYNDROME (47,XXY)
Pathophysiology  The  classic  form  of  KS  (47,XXY)  occurs  after 
meiotic nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes during gametogenesis 
(40%  during  spermatogenesis,  60%  during  oogenesis).  Other  forms 
of  KS  (including  mosaic  46,XY/47,XXY  [10–20%],  48,XXYY,  and 
48,XXXY) are less common. KS has an incidence of at least 1 in 1000 
men,  but  ~75%  of  cases  are  not  diagnosed.  Of  those  diagnosed,  his-
torically only 10% were identified prepubertally. However, the advent 
of noninvasive prenatal testing is leading to increased detection at an 
earlier age.

Clinical  Features  KS  is  most  commonly  characterized  by  small 
testes,  infertility,  gynecomastia,  tall  stature/increased  leg  length,  and 
hypogonadism  in  phenotypic  males.  At  birth,  most  infants  with  KS 
do not have clinical features, although there are higher rates of cryp-
torchidism  and  hypospadias.  Most  patients  present  in  puberty  with 
arrested  pubertal  development  caused  by  testicular  insufficiency. 
Others are diagnosed after puberty, based on low androgens, gyneco-
mastia, or infertility. Testes are small and firm (median length 2.5 cm 
[4  mL  volume];  almost  always  <3.5  cm  [12  mL])  and  typically  seem 
inappropriately  small  for  the  degree  of  androgenization.  Biopsies  are 
not  usually  necessary  but  typically  reveal  seminiferous  tubule  hyali-
nization  and  azoospermia.  Other  clinical  features  of  KS  are  listed  in 
Table  390-3.  Plasma  concentrations  of  FSH  and  luteinizing  hormone 
(LH) are increased in most adults with 47,XXY, and plasma testoster-
one  is  decreased  (50–75%),  reflecting  primary  gonadal  insufficiency. 
Estradiol  is  often  increased,  resulting  in  gynecomastia  (Chap.  391). 
Patients with mosaic forms of KS have less severe clinical features, have 
larger testes, and sometimes achieve spontaneous fertility.

TREATMENT
Klinefelter Syndrome
Growth,  endocrine  function,  and  bone  mineralization  should 
be  monitored,  especially  from  adolescence.  Educational  and 
psychological  support  is  important  for  many  individuals  with

KS.  Androgen  supplementation  improves  virilization,  libido, 
energy,  hypofibrinolysis,  and  bone  mineralization  in  men  with 
low testosterone levels but may occasionally worsen gynecomas-
tia (Chap. 391). Gynecomastia can be treated by surgical reduc-
tion if it causes concern (Chap. 391). Fertility has been achieved by 
using in vitro fertilization in men with oligospermia or with intra-
cytoplasmic  sperm  injection  (ICSI)  after  retrieval  of  spermatozoa 
by  testicular  sperm  extraction  techniques.  In  specialized  centers, 
successful spermatozoa retrieval using this technique is possible in 
>50% of men with nonmosaic KS. Results may be better in younger 
men. After ICSI and embryo transfer, successful pregnancies can be 
achieved in ~50% of these cases. The risk of transmitting chromo-
somal anomalies needs to be considered and counseling provided, 
although  this  outcome  is  much  less  common  than  originally  pre-
dicted. Long-term monitoring of men with KS is important given 
the  increased  risk  of  breast  cancer,  cardiovascular  disease,  meta-
bolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and autoimmune disorders. Because 
most  men  with  KS  are  never  diagnosed,  it  is  important  that  all 
internists  consider  this  diagnosis  in  men  with  these  features  who 
might be seeking medical advice for other conditions.

 ■ TURNER SYNDROME  
(GONADAL DYSGENESIS; 45,X)
Pathophysiology  TS is caused by complete or partial loss of one 
X  chromosome  and  affects  ~1  in  2500  women.  Approximately  one-
half of women with TS have a 45,X karyotype, ~20% have 45,X/46,XX 

mosaicism, and the remainder have structural abnormalities of the X 
chromosome such as X fragments, isochromosomes, rings, or Y chro-
mosome material. The clinical features of TS result from haploinsuffi-
ciency of multiple X chromosomal genes (e.g., short stature homeobox, 
SHOX),  either  directly  or  through  effects  on  autosomal  gene  expres-
sion. However, imprinted genes are also proposed to be affected when 
the inherited X has different parental origins.

Clinical  Features  TS  is  characterized  by  female  external  genita-
lia,  short  stature,  hypergonadotropic  hypogonadism,  infertility,  and 
other  phenotypic  features  (Table  390-3).  Infants  may  present  with 
lymphedema, nuchal folds, low hairline, or left-sided cardiac defects or 
later in childhood with unexplained growth failure or delayed puberty. 
Although limited spontaneous pubertal development occurs in up to 
30%  of  girls  with  TS  (10%,  45,X;  60%,  45,X/46,XX)  and  up  to  20% 
have menarche, the vast majority of women with TS develop complete 
ovarian  insufficiency.  Therefore,  this  diagnosis  should  be  considered 
in all women who present with primary or secondary amenorrhea and 
elevated gonadotropin levels.

TREATMENT
Turner Syndrome

The  management  of  girls  and  women  with  TS  requires  a  multi-
disciplinary  approach  to  address  many  potentially  affected  organ 
systems  according  to  TS  practice  guidelines.  Individuals  require 
long-term  monitoring  by  an  experienced  cardiologist  to  follow

Clinical Features

congenital  heart  defects  (CHDs)  (30%)  (bicuspid  aortic  valve, 
30–50%;  coarctation  of  the  aorta,  30%;  aortic  root  dilation,  5%), 
antibiotic prophylaxis for dental or surgical procedures, and serial 
magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  of  aortic  root  dimensions,  as 
progressive  aortic  root  dilation  is  associated  with  increased  risk 
of  aortic  dissection.  Individuals  found  to  have  congenital  renal 
and  urinary  tract  malformations  (30%)  are  at  risk  for  urinary 
tract infections, hypertension, and nephrocalcinosis. Hypertension 
can  occur  independently  of  cardiac  and  renal  malformations  and 
should  be  monitored  and  treated  as  in  other  patients  with  essen-
tial hypertension. Regular assessment of thyroid function, weight, 
dentition, hearing, speech, vision, and educational issues should be 
performed during childhood. Counseling about long-term growth 
and fertility issues should be provided. Patient support groups are 
active throughout the world and can play an invaluable role.

Short  stature  is  common,  and  untreated  final  height  rarely 
exceeds 150 cm in nonmosaic 45,X TS. Recombinant growth hor-
mone has been used in an attempt to increase growth, sometimes 
with oxandrolone in older children. Girls with evidence of ovarian 
insufficiency  require  estrogen  replacement  to  induce  breast  and 
uterine  development,  support  growth,  and  maintain  bone  miner-
alization.  Most  physicians  now  initiate  low-dose  estrogen  therapy 
to induce puberty at an age-appropriate time (~11 years). Doses of 
estrogen are increased gradually to allow development over a 2- to 
4-year  period.  Progestins  are  added  later  to  regulate  withdrawal 
bleeds. A very small percentage of women with TS have had spon-
taneous pregnancy, whereas others have achieved successful preg-
nancy after ovum donation and in vitro fertilization, but the risks of 
cardiac complications are high, and expert counseling and manage-
ment are needed. Long-term follow-up of women with TS includes 
careful surveillance of sex hormone replacement and reproductive 
function,  bone  mineralization,  cardiac  function  and  aortic  root 
dimensions, blood pressure, weight and glucose tolerance, hepatic 
and lipid profiles, thyroid function, skin examination, and hearing. 
This service is provided by a dedicated TS clinic in some centers.

 ■ 45,X/46,XY MOSAICISM
The phenotype of individuals with 45,X/46,XY mosaicism (sometimes 
called  mixed  gonadal  dysgenesis)  can  vary  considerably.  Some  have  a 
predominantly  female  phenotype  (see  TS  above).  Most  45,X/46,XY 
individuals  have  a  male  phenotype  and  testes,  and  the  diagnosis  is 
made  incidentally  after  amniocentesis  or  during  investigation  of 
infertility.  In  practice,  most  newborns  referred  for  assessment  have 
atypical genitalia and variable somatic features. There is often marked 
asymmetry,  with  a  streak  gonad  and  hemiuterus  on  one  side  and  a 
partially  descended  dysgenetic  testis  and  hemiscrotum  on  the  other 
side. Many children are raised as boys, but in some children, sex desig-
nation (whether to raise the baby as male or female) must be decided 
by  parents  and  the  multidisciplinary  team.  In  these  children,  gender 
identity may be harder to predict. There is an increased risk of germ 
cell cancer (GCC), up to 35% in intraabdominal gonads, so prophylac-
tic removal of intraabdominal gonads is usually considered. Individu-
als raised as males often have reconstructive surgery for hypospadias 
and  removal  of  dysgenetic  or  streak  gonads  if  the  gonads  cannot  be 
brought  down  into  the  scrotum.  Scrotal  testes  can  be  preserved  but 
require  regular  examination  for  tumor  development  and  sonography 
at the time of puberty. Biopsy for carcinoma in situ is recommended 
in adolescence, and testosterone supplementation may be required to 
support androgenization in puberty or if low testosterone is detected 
in adulthood. As 45,X/46,XY mosaicism can be associated with other 
features (e.g., cardiac, renal), individuals should be monitored accord-
ing to TS guidelines. Infertility is typical, but non-azoospermia or focal 
spermatogenesis  has  been  reported,  highlighting  the  importance  of 
individualized approaches to management.
 ■ OVOTESTICULAR DSD
Ovotesticular DSD (OTDSD) is a condition in which an individual has 
both ovarian and testicular tissue, either by having both an ovary and 
a testis or by having an ovotestis. Most individuals with this diagnosis 
have a 46,XX karyotype (especially in individuals of African ancestry), 
although  46,XX/46,XY  chimerism  and  rarely  a  46,XY  karyotype  is 
also possible. OTDSD usually presents with atypical genitalia at birth

3002 and sometimes breast development, cyclical hematuria, and/or phallic 
development  at  puberty.  Progressive  regression  of  the  ovarian  and/
or  testicular  component  can  occur  over  time.  Gender  identity  varies 
in  OTDSD  but  often  aligns  with  assigned  sex.  Risk  of  GCC  is  also 
elevated in OTDSD (~3%) and may occur in the ovarian or testicular 
component. Infertility is typical (especially in 46,XX testes with no Y 
chromosome), but births have occurred via ovum or sperm from indi-
viduals with other forms of OTDSD.

DISORDERS OF GONADAL AND 
PHENOTYPIC SEX
Disorders of gonadal and phenotypic sex can result in reduced andro-
gen production or action in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype (46,XY 
DSD) or excess androgen production in individuals with a 46,XX kar-
yotype (46,XX DSD) (Table 390-1). These conditions cover a spectrum 
of phenotypes ranging from phenotypic females with a Y chromosome 
to phenotypic males with a 46,XX karyotype to individuals with atyp-
ical genitalia. Karyotype is a useful starting investigation for diagnosis 
but does not define an individual’s gender.

 ■ 46,XY DSD
Underandrogenization of the 46,XY fetus reflects defects in androgen 
production or action. It can result from disorders of testis development, 
defects of androgen synthesis, or resistance to testosterone and DHT 
(Table 390-1).

Disorders  of  Testis  Development  •  TESTICULAR  DYSGENESIS  
Complete  gonadal  dysgenesis  (CGD,  Swyer’s  syndrome)  is  associated 
with  streak  gonads,  müllerian  structures  (due  to  insufficient  AMH/
MIS  secretion),  and  a  complete  absence  of  androgenization.  Phe-
notypic  females  with  this  condition  often  present  because  of  absent 
pubertal development and are found to have a 46,XY karyotype. Serum 
sex steroids, AMH/MIS, and inhibin B are low, and LH and FSH are 
elevated. Individuals with CGD typically identify as female. The risk of 
GCC is high, and intraabdominal gonads should be removed. In con-
trast, patients with partial gonadal dysgenesis (PGD, dysgenetic testes) 
may produce enough MIS to regress the uterus and sufficient testoster-
one for partial androgenization and, therefore, usually present in the 
newborn period with atypical genitalia, highlighting the spectrum of 
features that are typically seen with many DSDs.

Testicular dysgenesis can result from disruption of testis-promoting 
genes (e.g., WT1, SF1, SRY, SOX9, MAP3K1, DHH, DHX37, and others) 
or, rarely, duplication of chromosomal loci containing “antitestis” genes 
(e.g.,  DAX1)  (Table  390-4).  Among  these,  deletions  or  mutations  of 
SRY and heterozygous mutations of SF1 (NR5A1) or DHX37 appear to 
be most common but still account collectively for <30% of cases. Asso-
ciated clinical features may be present, reflecting additional functional 
roles for these genes. For example, renal dysfunction occurs in patients 
with specific WT1 mutations (Denys-Drash and Frasier’s syndromes), 
primary  adrenal  insufficiency  occurs  in  a  minority  of  patients  with 
disruption  of  SF1,  and  severe  cartilage  abnormalities  (campomelic 
dysplasia) are the predominant clinical feature of pathogenic variants 
in  SOX9.  A  family  history  of  DSD,  hypospadias,  infertility,  or  early 
menopause is important because variations in some genes (e.g., SF1/
NR5A1, SOX8) can be associated with a range of reproductive pheno-
types.  SF1  variants  are  sometimes  inherited  from  a  mother  in  a  sex- 
limited  dominant  manner  (which  can  mimic  X-linked  inheritance), 
and a woman may later develop primary ovarian insufficiency because 
of  the  effect  of  SF1  on  the  ovary.  Gender  identity  can  be  variable  in 
PGD. Dysgenetic testes have an increased risk of GCC. For descended 
testes, monitoring via physical examination is appropriate. If testes are 
intraabdominal and not able to be brought down, they may be removed 
to prevent GCC (risk up to 35% if intraabdominal). Dysgenetic testes 
may or may not produce sufficient testosterone for puberty. In those 
who  identify  as  male,  testosterone  replacement  may  be  needed.  In 
those who identify as female, estrogen replacement will be needed for 
female-typical pubertal development and ongoing sex steroid require-
ments.  Absent  (vanishing)  testis  syndrome  (bilateral  anorchia)  reflects 
regression of the testis during development. The absence of müllerian 

structures indicates adequate secretion of AMH early in utero. Usually, 
androgenization  of  the  external  genitalia  is  normal.  The  etiology  is 
often  unknown  but  sometimes  associated  with  pathogenic  variants 
in DHX37. These individuals can be offered testicular prostheses and 
androgen replacement in adolescence and typically identify as male.

Disorders of Androgen Synthesis  Defects  in  the  pathway  that 
regulates androgen synthesis (Fig. 390-4) cause underandrogenization 
of  the  46,XY  fetus  (Table  390-1).  Müllerian  regression  is  unaffected 
because  Sertoli  cell  function  is  preserved,  and  no  uterus  is  found. 
These conditions can present with a spectrum of genital appearances, 
ranging from female-typical external genitalia or clitoromegaly in some 
individuals to penoscrotal hypospadias or a small phallus in others.
LH RECEPTOR  Mutations in the LH receptor (LHCGR) cause Leydig 
cell  hypoplasia  and  androgen  deficiency,  due  to  impaired  actions  of 
human chorionic gonadotropin in utero and LH late in gestation and 
during the neonatal period. As a result, testosterone and DHT synthe-
sis are reduced.
STEROIDOGENIC  ENZYME  PATHWAYS  Mutations  in  steroidogenic 
acute regulatory protein (StAR) and CYP11A1 affect both adrenal and 
gonadal steroidogenesis (Fig. 390-4) (Chap. 386). Affected individuals 
(46,XY) usually have severe early-onset salt-losing adrenal failure and a 
female phenotype, although later-onset milder variants are increasingly 
reported. Defects in 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3B2) 
also cause adrenal insufficiency in severe cases, but the accumulation 
of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has a mild androgenizing effect, 
resulting  in  atypical  genitalia  or  hypospadias.  Salt  loss  occurs  in 
many but not all children. Patients with CAH due to 17α-hydroxylase 
(CYP17A1) deficiency have variable underandrogenization and develop 
hypertension and hypokalemia due to the potent salt-retaining effects 
of corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone. Patients with complete 
loss of 17α-hydroxylase function often present as phenotypic females 
who  do  not  enter  puberty  and  are  found  to  have  inguinal  testes  and 
hypertension  in  adolescence.  Some  mutations  in  CYP17  selectively 
impair  17,20-lyase  activity  without  altering  17α-hydroxylase  activity, 
leading to underandrogenization without mineralocorticoid excess and 
hypertension.  Disruption  of  the  coenzyme,  cytochrome  b5  (CYB5A), 
can  present  similarly,  and  methemoglobinemia  is  usually  present. 
Mutations in P450 oxidoreductase (POR) affect multiple steroidogenic 
enzymes, leading to reduced androgen production and a biochemical 
pattern  of  apparent  combined  21-hydroxylase  and  17α-hydroxylase 
deficiency,  sometimes  with  skeletal  abnormalities  (Antley-Bixler  cra-
niosynostosis).  Defects  in  17β-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase  type  3 
(HSD17B3)  and  5α-reductase  type  2  (SRD5A2)  interfere  with  the 
synthesis  of  testosterone  and  DHT,  respectively.  These  conditions 
are characterized by minimal or absent androgenization in utero, but 
some  phallic  development  can  occur  during  adolescence  due  to  the 
action of other enzyme isoforms. Individuals with 5α-reductase type 2 
deficiency have normal wolffian structures and usually do not develop 
breast tissue. At puberty, the increase in testosterone induces muscle 
mass  and  other  virilizing  features  despite  DHT  deficiency.  DHT  gel 
can  improve  prepubertal  phallic  growth  in  patients  raised  as  male. 
Prevention  of  testosterone  exposure  (by  gonadectomy  or  pubertal 
suppression) in adolescence and estrogen replacement at puberty can 
be  considered  in  individuals  who  identify  as  female.  Disruption  of 
alternative pathways to fetal DHT production might also present with 
46,XY DSD (AKR1C2/AKR1C4).

Disorders  of  Androgen  Action  •  androgen  insensitivity 
syndrome  Pathogenic  variants  in  the  androgen  receptor  cause 
resistance  to  androgen  (testosterone,  DHT)  action  or  the  androgen 
insensitivity syndrome (AIS). AIS is a spectrum of disorders that affects 
at least 1 in 100,000 46,XY individuals. Because the androgen receptor 
is X-linked, only 46,XY offspring are affected. The condition is usually 
inherited from a mother who carries the sequence variant but can also 
arise de novo. XY individuals with complete AIS (formerly called tes-
ticular feminization syndrome) have a female phenotype, normal breast 
development (due to aromatization of testosterone), a short vagina but 
no  uterus  (because  AMH/MIS  production  is  normal),  scanty  pubic

and  axillary  hair,  and  typically  a  female  gender  identity  and  sex  role 
behavior.  Gonadotropins  and  testosterone  levels  can  be  low,  normal, 
or elevated, depending on the degree of androgen resistance and the 
contribution of estradiol to feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-gonadal  axis.  AMH/MIS  levels  in  childhood  are  normal  or 
high. CAIS sometimes presents as inguinal hernias (containing testes) 
in childhood or more often with primary amenorrhea in late adoles-
cence. In the past, gonadectomy was recommended in childhood, but 
due to the low risk of malignancy (~2%), increasingly this is delayed, 
and  gonads  are  left  in  situ  until  breast  development  is  complete. 
Subsequently,  the  adolescent  or  young  adult  should  be  counseled 
about  the  risk  of  malignancy  and  the  option  for  gonadectomy  (with 

estrogen replacement), especially because early detection of premalig-
nant changes by imaging or biomarkers is currently not possible. The 
use  of  graded  dilators  in  adolescence  is  often  sufficient  to  dilate  the 
vagina for sexual activity.

Partial AIS (Reifenstein’s syndrome) results from androgen receptor 
mutations  that  maintain  residual  function.  Patients  often  present  in 
infancy  with  penoscrotal  hypospadias  and  undescended  testes  and 
with gynecomastia at the time of puberty. Gender identity can be vari-
able. At puberty, testes produce testosterone with variable phenotypic 
development. For those who identify as male, high-dose testosterone 
has been given to support development if puberty does not progress, 
but long-term data are limited. For those raised as female, testosterone

effects at puberty can be prevented (by gonadectomy or pubertal sup-
pression) and female-typical puberty induced with estrogen. They also 
have  an  increased  risk  of  GCC,  again  raising  the  question  of  if  and 
when to perform gonadectomy. Azoospermia and male-factor infertil-
ity also have been described in association with mild loss-of-function 
mutations in the androgen receptor.
 ■ OTHER DISORDERS AFFECTING 46,XY MALES
Persistent  müllerian  duct  syndrome  is  the  presence  of  a  uterus  in  an 
otherwise  phenotypic  male.  This  condition  can  result  from  patho-
genic variants in AMH or its receptor (AMHR2). The uterus may be 
removed, but only if damage to the vasa deferentia and blood supply 
to  the  testes  can  be  avoided.  Isolated  hypospadias  occurs  in  ~1  in 
250  males.  Most  cases  are  idiopathic,  although  evidence  of  penos-
crotal  hypospadias,  poor  phallic  development,  and/or  bilateral  cryp-
torchidism requires investigation for an underlying DSD (e.g., partial 
gonadal dysgenesis, mild defect in testosterone action, or even severe 
forms of 46,XX CAH). Unilateral undescended testes (cryptorchidism) 
affect >3% of boys at birth. Orchidopexy should be considered if the 
testis has not descended by 6–9 months of age. Bilateral cryptorchidism 
occurs  less  frequently  and  should  raise  suspicion  of  gonadotropin 
deficiency  or  DSD.  Syndromic  associations  and  intrauterine  growth 
retardation also occur relatively frequently in association with impaired 
testicular function or target tissue responsiveness, but the underlying 
etiology of many of these conditions is unknown.

 ■ 46,XX DSD
Androgenization  of  the  46,XX  fetus  occurs  when  the  gonad  (ovary) 
contains androgen-secreting testicular tissue or after increased andro-
gen exposure, which is usually adrenal in origin (Table 390-1).

46,XX Testicular DSD  Testicular tissue can 
develop in 46,XX testicular DSD (46,XX males) 
most  often  following  translocation  of  SRY.  This 
may  be  diagnosed  with  karyotype/phenotype 
discordance or later in life during evaluation for 
hypogonadism  or  infertility.  Individuals  with 
this  condition  develop  testes  with  normal  tes-
tosterone  production,  leading  to  external  male 
phenotype  in  utero,  and  produce  AMH/MIS  to 
regress  müllerian  structures.  They  have  azoo-
spermia due to lack of the AZF region of the Y 
chromosome.  Progressive  testicular  regression 
and hypogonadism are common. Gender identity 
is typically male.

46,XX OTDSD  Ovotestes (or testes) can also 
develop  in  individuals  with  a  46,XX  karyotype 
following  upregulation  of  SOX9  or  SOX3  or 
defects  in  RSPO1,  NR2F2,  WT1,  or  SF1/NR5A1 
(Table 390-5). OTDSD is discussed above under 
“Disorders of Chromosomal Sex.”

Increased  Androgen  Exposure  •  21- 
hydroxylase  deficiency  (congenital 
adrenal  hyperplasia)  The  classic  form 
of  21-hydroxylase  deficiency  (21-OHD)  is  the 
most  common  cause  of  CAH  (Chap.  386),  and 
it  is  the  most  common  cause  of  androgeniza-
tion  in  chromosomal  46,XX  females  (incidence 
between  1  in  10,000  and  1  in  15,000)  (Table 
390-5).  Affected  individuals  are  homozygous 
or  compound  heterozygous  for  severely  disrup-
tive  sequence  variants  in  the  gene  (CYP21A2) 
encoding  the  enzyme  21-hydroxylase.  Impaired 
21-hydroxylase  activity  prevents  adrenal  gluco-
corticoid  and  mineralocorticoid  synthesis,  thus 
shunting  steroid  precursors  into  the  androgen 
synthesis pathway (Fig. 390-4). Increased andro-
gen synthesis in utero causes androgenization of 
the  46,XX  fetus  in  the  first  trimester.  Atypical 
genitalia are seen at birth, with varying degrees of clitoral enlargement 
and labial fusion.

A salt-wasting crisis usually manifests between 5 and 21 days of life 
and  is  a  potentially  life-threatening  event  that  requires  urgent  fluid 
resuscitation  and  steroid  treatment.  Thus,  a  diagnosis  of  21-OHD 
should be considered in any baby with atypical genitalia with bilateral 
nonpalpable  gonads.  Males  (46,XY)  with  21-OHD  have  no  genital 
abnormalities  at  birth  but  are  equally  susceptible  to  adrenal  insuffi-
ciency  and  salt-losing  crises.  Excess  androgen  production  can  cause 
gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in males with 21-OHD.
Patients with nonclassic 21-OHD produce normal amounts of corti-
sol and aldosterone but at the expense of producing excess androgens. 
Symptoms may include hirsutism, menstrual dysfunction, subfertility, 
and recurrent miscarriages. This is one of the most common recessive 
disorders  in  humans,  with  an  incidence  as  high  as  1  in  100–500  in 
many populations and 1 in 27 in Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European 
origin.

TREATMENT
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

Acute  salt-wasting  crises  require  fluid  resuscitation,  IV  hydro-
cortisone,  and  correction  of  hypoglycemia.  Once  the  patient  is 
stabilized,  glucocorticoids  must  be  given  to  correct  the  cortisol 
insufficiency and suppress ACTH stimulation, thereby preventing 
further  virilization,  rapid  skeletal  maturation,  adrenal  rest  tumor 
formation, and the development of polycystic ovaries. Mineralocor-
ticoid replacement may be needed, along with salt supplements in 
early life. In childhood, treatment is also titrated carefully to prevent

Individuals with 46,XX CAH due to classic 21-OHD historically 
underwent  genitoplasty  in  infancy,  but  if  and  when  these  proce-
dures should be performed is debated. Concerns have arisen about 
the importance of assent/consent by the individual for genital sur-
gery, potential long-term side effects related to sexual function and 
ability to achieve orgasm, and the increased incidence of nonfemale 
gender identity. Surgical options include vaginoplasty and clitoro-
plasty. When vaginoplasty is performed in infancy, surgical revision 
or vaginal dilation may still be needed in adolescence or adulthood 
and, if deferred, may be necessary for menstrual flow or intercourse. 
Current  clinical  practice  guidelines  recommend  that  parents  be 
informed of all surgical options including the option to defer sur-
gery.  Women  with  21-OHD  frequently  develop  polycystic  ovaries 
and  have  subfertility.  The  latter  occurs  due  to  multiple  factors 
including anatomic barriers, hormone imbalances, and psychologi-
cal effects of the condition. Preconception genetic counseling is rec-
ommended. Due to concerns about fetal neurologic development, 
prenatal treatment with dexamethasone to prevent androgenization 
of a fetus is currently not recommended unless in a study protocol 
that allows long-term follow-up of all children treated.

The treatment of other forms of CAH (including in 46,XY indi-
viduals)  includes  mineralocorticoid  and  glucocorticoid  replace-
ment  for  salt-losing  conditions  (e.g.,  StAR,  CYP11A1,  HSD3B2), 
suppression  of  ACTH  drive  with  glucocorticoids  in  disorders 
associated  with  hypertension  (e.g.,  CYP11B1),  and  appropriate 
sex  hormone  replacement  in  adolescence  and  adulthood,  when   
necessary.

OTHER  CAUSES  Increased  androgen  synthesis  can  also  occur  in 
CAH  due  to  defects  in  POR,  11β-hydroxylase  (CYP11B1),  and  3β- 
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3B2) and with mutations in 
the genes encoding aromatase (CYP19). Increased androgen exposure 

in  utero  can  occur  with  maternal  virilizing  tumors,  luteomas,  and 
ingestion of androgenic compounds.

 ■ OTHER DISORDERS AFFECTING 46,XX FEMALES
Congenital absence of the vagina occurs in association with müllerian 
agenesis or hypoplasia as part of the Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser 
(MRKH) syndrome. This diagnosis should be considered in otherwise 
phenotypic  females  with  primary  amenorrhea.  Associated  features 
include renal (agenesis) and cervical spinal abnormalities.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
The approach to a child or adolescent with atypical genitalia or another 
DSD  requires  cultural  sensitivity,  as  the  concepts  of  sex  and  gender 
vary  widely  around  the  world.  Rare  genetic  DSDs  can  occur  more 
frequently  in  specific  populations  (e.g.,  5α-reductase  type  2  in  the 
Dominican Republic). Different forms of CAH also show ethnic and 
geographic  variability.  In  many  countries,  appropriate  biochemical 
tests may not be readily available, and access to appropriate forms of 
treatment and support may be limited.

391 Disorders of the Testes and 
Male Reproductive System
Shalender Bhasin, J. Larry Jameson

The male reproductive system regulates sex differentiation, androgeni-
zation, and the hormonal changes that accompany puberty, ultimately 
leading to spermatogenesis and fertility. Under the control of the pitu-
itary  hormones—luteinizing  hormone  (LH)  and  follicle-stimulating 
hormone  (FSH)—the  Leydig  cells  of  the  testes  produce  testosterone 
and germ cells are nurtured by Sertoli cells to divide, differentiate, and 
mature into sperm. During embryonic development, testosterone and 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induce the wolffian duct and virilization of 
the external genitalia. During puberty, testosterone promotes somatic 
growth  and  the  development  of  secondary  sex  characteristics.  In  the 
adult,  testosterone  is  necessary  for  spermatogenesis,  libido  and  nor-
mal sexual function, and maintenance of muscle and bone mass. This 
chapter focuses on the physiology of the testes and disorders associated 
with decreased androgen production, which may be caused by gonad-
otropin deficiency or by primary testis dysfunction. Infertility occurs 
in ~5% of men and is increasingly amenable to treatment by hormone 
replacement  or  by  using  sperm  transfer  techniques.  For further dis-
cussion of sexual dysfunction, disorders of the prostate, and testicu-
lar cancer, see Chaps. 397, 87, and 88, respectively.

DEVELOPMENT AND STRUCTURE  
OF THE TESTIS
The  fetal  testis  develops  from  a  single  bipotential  progenitor  cell 
population in the undifferentiated gonad after expression of a genetic 
cascade that is initiated by the gene encoding SRY (sex-related gene on 
the Y chromosome) (Chap. 390). SRY, whose expression is regulated by 
histone modification and DNA methylation, induces differentiation of 
Sertoli cells, which surround germ cells and, together with peritubular 
myoid cells, form testis cords that will later develop into seminiferous 
tubules. Fetal Leydig cells and endothelial cells migrate into the gonad 
from  the  adjacent  mesonephros  but  may  also  arise  from  interstitial 
cells  that  reside  between  testis  cords.  Fetal  Leydig  cells  atrophy  after 
birth and do not contribute to the origin of adult Leydig cells, which 
originate from undifferentiated progenitor cells that appear in the tes-
tis after birth and acquire full steroidogenic function during puberty. 
Testosterone  produced  by  the  fetal  Leydig  cells  supports  the  growth 
and  differentiation  of  Wolffian  duct  structures  that  develop  into  the 
epididymis,  vas  deferens,  and  seminal  vesicles.  Testosterone  is  also 
converted to DHT (see below), which induces formation of the pros-
tate and the external male genitalia, including the penis, urethra, and 
scrotum. Testicular descent through the inguinal canal is controlled in 
part by Leydig cell production of insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3), which 
acts via a receptor termed great (G protein–coupled receptor affecting 
testis  descent).  Sertoli  cells  produce  Müllerian  inhibiting  substance 
(MIS), which causes regression of the Müllerian structures, including 
the fallopian tube, uterus, and upper segment of the vagina.

NORMAL MALE PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT
Puberty commonly refers to the maturation of the reproductive axis and 
the development of secondary sex characteristics. In addition to repro-
ductive hormones, it requires a coordinated response of multiple hor-
monal systems including metabolic signals (e.g., leptin), as well as the 
adrenal and growth hormone (GH) axes (Fig. 391-1). The development 
of secondary sex characteristics is initiated by adrenarche, which usually 
occurs between 6 and 8 years of age when the adrenal gland begins to 
produce  greater  amounts  of  androgens  from  the  zona  reticularis,  the 
principal site of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) production. The sex 
maturation process is greatly accelerated by the activation of the hypo-
thalamic-pituitary  axis  and  the  production  of  gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone  (GnRH).  The  GnRH  pulse  generator  in  the  hypothalamus

is  active  during  fetal  life  and  early  infancy  but  is  restrained  until  the 
early  stages  of  puberty  by  a  neuroendocrine  brake  imposed  by  the 
inhibitory  actions  of  glutamate  and  γ-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA) 
in  the  mediobasal  hypothalamus  and  neuropeptide  Y.  Although  the 
pathways that initiate reactivation of the GnRH pulse generator at the 
onset of puberty remain incompletely understood, mounting evidence 
supports  involvement  of  GPR54,  a  G  protein–coupled  receptor  that 
binds an endogenous ligand, kisspeptin. Individuals with mutations of 
GPR54 fail to enter puberty, and experiments in primates demonstrate 
that  infusion  of  the  ligand  is  sufficient  to  induce  premature  puberty. 
Kisspeptin signaling plays an important role in mediating the feedback 
action of sex steroids on gonadotropin secretion and in regulating the 
tempo of sexual maturation at puberty. Leptin, a hormone produced by 
adipose cells, plays a permissive role in the resurgence of GnRH secretion 
at the onset of puberty, as leptin-deficient individuals also fail to enter 
puberty (Chap. 401). The adipocyte hormone leptin, the gut hormone 
ghrelin, neuropeptide Y, and kisspeptin integrate the signals originating 
in  energy  stores  and  metabolic  tissues  with  mechanisms  that  control 
onset of puberty through regulation of GnRH secretion. Energy deficit 
and excess and metabolic stress are associated with disturbed reproduc-
tive maturation and timing of puberty.

The  early  stages  of  puberty  are  characterized  by  nocturnal  surges 
of LH and FSH. Growth of the testes is usually the first clinical sign 
of  puberty,  reflecting  an  increase  in  seminiferous  tubule  volume. 
Increasing levels of testosterone deepen the voice and stimulate muscle 
growth.  Conversion  of  testosterone  to  DHT  leads  to  growth  of  the 
external  genitalia  and  pubic  hair.  DHT  also  stimulates  prostate  and 
facial hair growth and initiates recession of the temporal hairline. The 
growth spurt occurs at a testicular volume of ~10–12 mL. GH increases 
early  in  puberty  and  is  stimulated  in  part  by  the  rise  in  gonadal  ste-
roids.  GH  increases  the  level  of  insulin-like  growth  factor  1  (IGF-1), 
which enhances linear bone growth. The prolonged pubertal exposure 
to  gonadal  steroids  (mainly  estradiol)  ultimately  induces  epiphyseal 
closure and limits further bone growth.

REGULATION OF TESTICULAR FUNCTION
 ■ REGULATION OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-
PITUITARY-TESTIS AXIS IN ADULT MAN
Pulsatile  secretion  of  GnRH  in  the  hypothalamus  is  regulated  by 
the  KNDy  neurons  through  the  release  of  kisspeptin,  neurokinin  B 
(NKB), and dynorphin (Fig. 391-2). Kisspeptin binds to the kisspeptin 
(GPR54) receptors in the cell bodies of the GnRH neurons as well as in 
the GnRH nerve terminals in the median eminence to induce pulsatile 
GnRH secretion into the portal blood. As a component of this auto-
crine/paracrine  loop,  NKB  released  by  the  KNDy  neurons  activates 
NK3R  to  stimulate  kisspeptin  release.  KNDy  neurons  also  produce 
dynorphin  A,  which  inhibits  basal  as  well  as  NKB-stimulated  kiss-
peptin  release  through  the  mediation  of  K-type  opioid  receptor.  The

LH and FSH. These dynamic hormone pulses account in part for the 
wide  variations  in  LH  and  testosterone,  even  within  the  same  indi-
vidual. LH acts primarily on the Leydig cell to stimulate testosterone 
synthesis. The regulatory control of androgen synthesis is modulated 
by  dynamic  integration  of  the  feedforward  elements  exerted  on  the 
testis  by  LH  and  FSH  and  the  feedback  exerted  by  testosterone  and 
estrogen on both the hypothalamus and the pituitary. FSH acts on the 
Sertoli cell to regulate spermatogenesis and the production of Sertoli 
products such as inhibin B, which acts to selectively suppress pituitary 
FSH. Despite these somewhat distinct Leydig and Sertoli cell–regulated 
pathways, testis function is integrated at several levels: GnRH regulates 
both gonadotropins; spermatogenesis requires high levels of testoster-
one; and numerous paracrine interactions between Leydig and Sertoli 
cells are necessary for normal testis function.

 ■ THE LEYDIG CELL: ANDROGEN SYNTHESIS
LH  binds  to  its  seven-transmembrane  G  protein–coupled  receptor 
to  activate  the  cyclic  AMP  pathway.  Stimulation  of  the  LH  receptor 
induces  steroid  acute  regulatory  (StAR)  protein,  along  with  several 
steroidogenic  enzymes  involved  in  androgen  synthesis.  LH  receptor 
mutations cause Leydig cell hypoplasia or agenesis, underscoring the 
importance of this pathway for Leydig cell development and function. 
The rate-limiting process in testosterone synthesis is the transport of 
intracellular cholesterol by the StAR protein to the inner mitochondrial 
membrane. Mutations of the StAR protein are associated with congeni-
tal lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, a rare form of congenital adrenal hyper-
plasia (CAH) characterized by very low adrenal and gonadal steroids. 
Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, a mitochondrial cholesterol-binding 
protein, is also an acute regulator of Leydig cell steroidogenesis. The 
major enzymatic steps involved in testosterone synthesis are summa-
rized in Fig. 391-3. After cholesterol transport into the mitochondrion, 
the  formation  of  pregnenolone  by  CYP11A1  (side  chain  cleavage 
enzyme)  is  a  limiting  enzymatic  step.  The  17α-hydroxylase  and  the 
17,20-lyase reactions are catalyzed by a single enzyme, CYP17A1; post-
translational  modification  (phosphorylation)  of  this  enzyme  and  the 
presence  of  specific  enzyme  cofactors,  such  as  cytochrome  B,  confer 
17,20-lyase  activity  selectively  in  the  testis  and  zona  reticularis  of  the 
adrenal gland. Although CYP17A1 is able to catalyze the conversion of 
progesterone to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, most of δ4-androstenedione 
in humans is not derived from 17α-hydroxyprogesterone but rather from 
the conversion of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA in the δ5 pathway 
and  further  conversion  of  DHEA  to  δ4-androstenedione.  Abiraterone 
is a dual inhibitor of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities, which 
play  an  important  role  in  androgen  synthesis  in  castration-resistant 
prostate cancers. Testosterone can be converted to the more potent DHT 
by a family of steroid 5α-reductase enzymes, or it can be aromatized to 
estradiol  by  CYP19  (aromatase).  At  least  two  isoforms  of  steroid  5α- 
reductase,  SRD5A1  and  SRD5A2,  have  been  described;  all  known 
patients with 5α-reductase deficiency have had mutations in SRD5A2, 
the predominant form in the prostate and the skin. Finasteride predom-
inantly inhibits SRD5A2, whereas dutasteride is a dual inhibitor of both 
SRD5A1 and SRD5A2. DHT can also be derived through the backdoor 
pathway in which 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is converted to androster-
one and eventually to DHT. Recent reports of mutations in the AKR1C2/4 
genes in undervirilized 46,XY individuals suggest that the backdoor path-
way for DHT formation, which was originally described in the tammar 
wallaby,  is  active  in  the  human  fetal  testis.  The  placental  progesterone 
serves as a substrate for the synthesis of androsterone via the backdoor 
pathway, which is then converted to DHT in the genital tubercle.

Testosterone Transport and Metabolism 
In males, 95% of cir-
culating testosterone is derived from testicular production (3–10 mg/d). 
Direct  secretion  of  testosterone  by  the  adrenal  and  the  peripheral 
conversion  of  androstenedione  to  testosterone  collectively  account 
for  another  0.5  mg/d  of  testosterone.  Only  a  small  amount  of  DHT 
(70  μg/d)  is  secreted  directly  by  the  testis;  most  circulating  DHT  is 
derived from peripheral conversion of testosterone. Most of the daily 
production of estradiol (~45 μg/d) in men is derived from aromatase-
mediated peripheral conversion of testosterone and androstenedione.

Classical Pathway

Alternate Backdoor Pathway

Circulating testosterone is bound predominantly to sex hormone–
binding  globulin  (SHBG)  and  albumin  (Fig.  391-4)  and,  to  a  lesser 
extent,  to  cortisol-binding  globulin  (CBG)  and  orosomucoid.  SHBG 
binds  testosterone  with  much  greater  affinity  than  albumin,  CBG, 
and  orosomucoid.  The  binding  proteins  regulate  the  transport  and 
bioavailability  of  testosterone.  SHBG  circulates  as  a  dimer,  and  tes-
tosterone’s  binding  to  SHBG  involves  intermonomeric  allostery  such 
that  neither  the  conformation  nor  the  binding  affinity  of  the  two 
monomers is equivalent. Similarly, estradiol binding to SHBG involves 
bidirectional,  intermonomeric  allostery  that  changes  the  distribution 
of both monomers among various energy and conformational states. 
Intermonomeric  allostery  offers  a  mechanism  to  extend  the  binding 
range of SHBG and regulate hormone bioavailability as sex hormone 
concentrations vary widely during life. Human serum albumin (HSA) 
contains multiple, allosterically coupled binding sites for testosterone. 

Testosterone  shares  these  binding  sites  on  HSA  with  free  fatty  acids. 
Commonly used drugs such as ibuprofen and antibiotics can displace 
testosterone from HSA under various physiologic states or disease con-
ditions, affecting its bioavailability. SHBG concentrations are decreased 
by  androgens,  obesity,  diabetes  mellitus,  hypothyroidism,  nephrotic 
syndrome,  and  genetic  factors.  Conversely,  estrogen  administration, 
hyperthyroidism,  many  chronic  inflammatory  illnesses,  infections 
such as HIV or hepatitis B and C, aging, and the use of some anticon-
vulsants are associated with high SHBG concentrations.

Testosterone  is  metabolized  predominantly  in  the  liver,  although 
some  degradation  occurs  in  peripheral  tissues,  particularly  the  pros-
tate  and  the  skin.  In  the  liver,  testosterone  is  converted  by  a  series 
of  enzymatic  steps  that  involve  5α-  and  5β-reductases,  3α-  and 
3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydroge-
nase into androsterone, etiocholanolone, DHT, and 3α-androstanediol.

These  compounds  undergo  glucuronidation  or  sulfation  before  being

Mechanism of Androgen Action  Testosterone exerts some of its 
biologic effects by binding to androgen receptor (AR), either directly 
or after its conversion to DHT by the steroid 5α reductase. The actions 
of  testosterone  on  the  Wolffian  structures,  skeletal  muscle,  erythro-
poiesis, and bone in men do not require its obligatory conversion to 
DHT.  However,  the  conversion  of  testosterone  to  DHT  is  necessary 
for  the  masculinization  of  the  urogenital  sinus  and  genital  tubercle. 
Aromatization of testosterone to estradiol mediates additional effects 
of  testosterone  on  bone  resorption,  epiphyseal  closure,  sexual  desire, 
vascular endothelium, and fat. DHT can also be converted in some tis-
sues by the combined actions of the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
and  3β-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase  to  5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol, 
which  is  a  high-affinity  ligand  and  agonist  of  estrogen  receptor  β. 
5α-DHT  is  further  converted  in  some  cell  types  to  5α-androstane- 
3α,17β-diol, a modulator of GABAA receptors.

The AR is structurally related to the nuclear receptors for estrogen, 
glucocorticoids, and progesterone (Chap. 377). The AR, a 919–amino 
acid protein with a molecular mass of ~110 kDa, is encoded by a gene 
on the long arm of the X chromosome. A polymorphic region in the 
amino terminus of the receptor, which contains a variable number of 
glutamine and glycine repeats, modifies the transcriptional activity of 
the receptor. The AR protein is distributed in both the cytoplasm and 
the  nucleus.  The  ligand  binding  to  the  AR  induces  conformational 
changes  that  allow  the  recruitment  and  assembly  of  tissue-specific 
cofactors and causes it to translocate into the nucleus, where it binds to 
specific androgen response elements in the DNA or other transcription 
factors already bound to DNA. Thus, the AR is a ligand-regulated tran-
scription  factor  that  regulates  the  expression  of  androgen-dependent 
genes in a tissue-specific manner. Testosterone binds to AR with half 
the affinity of DHT. The DHT-AR complex also has greater thermosta-
bility and a slower dissociation rate than the testosterone-AR complex. 
However,  the  molecular  basis  for  selective  testosterone  versus  DHT 
actions remains incompletely explained. Some androgen effects, such 
as  those  on  the  smooth  muscle,  may  be  mediated  by  nongenomic 
AR signal transduction pathways. The nongenomic actions of testos-
terone  involve  direct  activation  of  kinase  signaling  cascades  such  as 

mitogen-activated protein kinase and the cyclic AMP response element 
binding  protein  transcription  factor.  Some  effects  of  testosterone  on 
cell proliferation and autophagy require the mediation of GPRC6A.

 ■ THE SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES: 
SPERMATOGENESIS
The seminiferous tubules are convoluted, closed loops with both ends 
emptying into the rete testis, a network of progressively larger efferent 
ducts  that  ultimately  form  the  epididymis  (Fig.  391-2).  The  seminif-
erous  tubules  total  ~600  m  in  length  and  compose  about  two-thirds 
of  testis  volume.  The  walls  of  the  tubules  are  formed  by  polarized 
Sertoli  cells  that  are  apposed  to  peritubular  myoid  cells.  Tight  junc-
tions  between  Sertoli  cells  create  the  blood-testis  barrier.  Germ  cells 
compose the majority of the seminiferous epithelium (~60%) and are 
intimately embedded within the cytoplasmic extensions of the Sertoli 
cells,  which  function  as  “nurse  cells.”  Germ  cells  progress  through 
characteristic  stages  of  mitotic  and  meiotic  divisions.  A  pool  of  type 
A spermatogonia serve as stem cells capable of self-renewal. Primary 
spermatocytes  are  derived  from  type  B  spermatogonia  and  undergo 
meiosis before progressing to spermatids that undergo spermiogenesis 
(a  differentiation  process  involving  chromatin  condensation,  acqui-
sition  of  an  acrosome,  elongation  of  cytoplasm,  and  formation  of  a 
tail)  and  are  released  from  Sertoli  cells  as  mature  spermatozoa.  The 
complete differentiation process into mature sperm requires 74 days. 
Peristaltic-type action by peritubular myoid cells transports sperm into 
the efferent ducts. The spermatozoa spend an additional 21 days in the 
epididymis, where they undergo further maturation and capacitation. 
The normal adult testes produce >100 million sperm per day.

Naturally  occurring  mutations  in  FSHβ  or  in  the  FSH  receptor 
confirm an important, but not essential, role for this pathway in sper-
matogenesis.  Females  with  mutations  in  FSHβ  or  the  FSH  receptor 
are hypogonadal and infertile because ovarian follicles do not mature; 
males with these mutations exhibit variable degrees of reduced sper-
matogenesis,  presumably  because  of  impaired  Sertoli  cell  function. 
Because  Sertoli  cells  produce  inhibin  B,  an  inhibitor  of  FSH,  semi-
niferous tubule damage (e.g., by radiation) causes a selective increase 
of  FSH.  Testosterone  reaches  very  high  concentrations  locally  in  the 
testis and is essential for spermatogenesis. The cooperative actions of 
FSH and testosterone are important in the progression of meiosis and 
spermiation. In the prepubertal testis, testosterone alone is insufficient 
for completion of spermatogenesis; however, in men with postpuber-
tal  onset  of  gonadotropin  deficiency,  human  chorionic  gonadotropin 
(hCG)  or  recombinant  LH  can  reinitiate  spermatogenesis  without 
FSH. FSH and testosterone regulate germ cell survival via the intrinsic 
and extrinsic apoptotic mechanisms. FSH may also play an important 
role  in  supporting  spermatogonia.  Gonadotropin-regulated  testicular 
RNA helicase (GRTH/DDX25), a testis-specific gonadotropin/androgen- 
regulated RNA helicase, is present in germ cells and Leydig cells and 
may  be  an  important  factor  in  the  paracrine  regulation  of  germ  cell 
development.  Several  cytokines  and  growth  factors  are  also  involved 
in the regulation of spermatogenesis by paracrine and autocrine mech-
anisms. A number of knockout mouse models exhibit impaired germ 
cell  development  or  spermatogenesis,  presaging  possible  mutations 
associated with male infertility.

The human Y chromosome contains two pseudoautosomal regions 
that are located at the two tips of Y chromosome and can recombine 
with  homologous  regions  of  the  X  chromosome  (Fig.  391-5).  The 
genes  in  the  pseudoautosomal  regions  are  involved  in  cell  signaling, 
transcriptional  regulation,  and  mitochondrial  function.  Mutations 
of  genes  in  pseudoautosomal  region  1  are  associated  with  mental 
disorders  and  short  stature.  The  euchromatic  part  of  the  Y  chromo-
some that does not recombine with the X chromosome is referred to 
as  the  male-specific  region  of  the  Y  chromosome  (MSY).  The  MSY 
contains  nine  families  of  Y-specific  multicopy  genes;  many  of  these 
Y-specific  genes  are  also  testis-specific  and  necessary  for  spermato-
genesis.  Microdeletions  in  several  nonoverlapping  subregions  of  the 
Y chromosome—AZFa, AZFb, AZFc, and AZFd, which contain many 
spermatogenic genes (e.g., RNA-binding motif, RBM; deleted in azoo-
spermia,  DAZ)—are  associated  with  oligospermia  or  azoospermia.

Pseudoautosomal region 2

Approximately  15%  of  infertile  men  with  azoospermia  and  ~6%  of 
men with severe oligozoospermia harbor a Y microdeletion. Complete 
deletions  of  the  AZFa  and  AZFb  subregions  are  typically  associated 
with  Sertoli  cells  only  and  azoospermia  and  a  poor  prognosis  for 
sperm retrieval. In contrast, AZFc subregion microdeletions are typ-
ically  associated  with  oligozoospermia  and  higher  success  rates  for 
sperm retrieval. Microdeletion involving the DAZ genes in the AZFc 
region  is  one  of  the  most  common  Y  chromosome  microdeletions 
in  infertile  men.  Several  partial  deletions  of  the  AZFc  region  have 
been described including the gr/gr deletion, which is associated with 
infertility among Caucasian men in Europe and the Western Pacific 
region, whereas the b2/b3 deletion is associated with male infertility 
in African and Dravidian men.

TREATMENT
Male Factor Infertility
Treatment options for male factor infertility have expanded greatly 
in  recent  years.  Secondary  hypogonadism  is  highly  amenable  to 
treatment  with  pulsatile  GnRH  or  gonadotropins  (see  below). 
Assisted  reproductive  technologies,  such  as  in  vitro  fertilization 
(IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), have provided 
new opportunities for patients with primary testicular failure and 
disorders  of  sperm  transport.  Choice  of  initial  treatment  options 
depends on sperm concentration and motility. Expectant manage-
ment  should  be  attempted  initially  in  men  with  mild  male  factor 
infertility (sperm count of 15–20 × 106/mL and normal motility). 
Treatment  of  moderate  male  factor  infertility  (10–15  ×  106/mL 
and 20–40% motility) should begin with intrauterine insemination 
alone or in combination with treatment of the female partner with 
clomiphene or gonadotropins, but it may require IVF with or with-
out ICSI. For men with a severe defect (sperm count of <10 × 106/
mL, 10% motility), IVF with ICSI or donor sperm has become the 
treatment of choice. Yq microdeletions will be transmitted through 
ICSI from the affected father to his male offspring if sperm carrying 
the Yq microdeletion is used.

CLINICAL AND LABORATORY EVALUATION 
OF MALE REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION
 ■ HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The  history  should  focus  on  developmental  stages  such  as  puberty 
and growth spurts, as well as androgen-dependent events such as early 
morning  erections,  frequency  and  intensity  of  sexual  thoughts,  and 
frequency  of  masturbation  or  intercourse.  Although  libido  and  the 
overall  frequency  of  sexual  acts  are  decreased  in  androgen-deficient 
men,  young  hypogonadal  men  can  achieve  erections  in  response  to 
visual  erotic  stimuli.  Men  with  acquired  androgen  deficiency  often 
report decreased energy and low mood.

The  physical  examination  should  focus  on  secondary  sex 
characteristics  such  as  hair  growth,  gynecomastia,  testicular 
volume,  prostate,  and  height  and  body  proportions.  Eunuchoid 
proportions are defined as an arm span >2 cm greater than height 
and suggest that androgen deficiency occurred before epiphyseal 
fusion. Hair growth in the face, axilla, chest, and pubic regions 
is androgen-dependent; however, changes may not be noticeable 
unless  androgen  deficiency  is  severe  and  prolonged.  Ethnicity 
also  influences  the  intensity  of  hair  growth  (Chap.  394).  Tes-
ticular volume is best assessed by using a Prader orchidometer. 
Testes range from 3.5 to 5.5 cm in length, which corresponds to 
a volume of 12–25 mL. Advanced age does not influence testicu-
lar size, although the consistency becomes less firm. Asian men 
generally have smaller testes than western Europeans, indepen-
dent  of  differences  in  body  size.  Because  of  its  possible  role  in 
infertility, the presence of varicocele should be sought by palpa-
tion while the patient is standing; it is more common on the left 
side. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome have markedly reduced 
testicular  volumes  (1–2  mL).  In  congenital  hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism, testicular volumes provide a good index for the degree 
of gonadotropin deficiency and the likelihood of response to therapy.

 ■ GONADOTROPIN AND INHIBIN MEASUREMENTS
LH and FSH are measured using two-site immunoradiometric, immu-
nofluorometric,  or  chemiluminescent  assays,  which  have  very  low 
cross-reactivity with other pituitary glycoprotein hormones and hCG 
and  have  sufficient  sensitivity  to  measure  the  low  levels  present  in 
patients  with  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism.  In  men  with  a  low 
testosterone  level,  an  LH  level  can  distinguish  primary  (high  LH) 
versus secondary (low or inappropriately normal LH) hypogonadism. 
An elevated LH level indicates a primary defect at the testicular level, 
whereas a low or inappropriately normal LH level suggests a defect at 
the  hypothalamic-pituitary  level.  LH  pulses  occur  about  every  1–3  h  in 
normal men. Thus, gonadotropin levels fluctuate, and samples should 
be pooled or repeated when results are equivocal. FSH is less pulsatile 
than  LH  because  it  has  a  longer  half-life.  Selective  increase  in  FSH 
suggests damage to the seminiferous tubules. Inhibin B, a Sertoli cell 
product  that  suppresses  FSH,  is  reduced  with  seminiferous  tubule 
damage. Inhibin B is a dimer with α-βB subunits and is measured by 
two-site immunoassays.

GnRH  Stimulation  Testing  The  GnRH  test  is  performed  by 
measuring  LH  and  FSH  concentrations  at  baseline  and  at  30  and  
60 min after intravenous administration of 100 μg of GnRH. A min-
imally  acceptable  response  is  a  twofold  LH  increase  and  a  50%  FSH 
increase.  In  the  prepubertal  period  or  with  severe  GnRH  deficiency, 
the gonadotrope may not respond to a single bolus of GnRH because 
it has not been primed by endogenous hypothalamic GnRH; in these 
patients,  GnRH  responsiveness  may  be  restored  by  chronic,  pulsatile 
GnRH  administration.  With  the  availability  of  sensitive  and  specific 
LH assays, GnRH stimulation testing is used rarely.

 ■ TESTOSTERONE ASSAYS
Total  Testosterone  Total  testosterone  includes  both  unbound 
and protein-bound testosterone and is measured by radioimmunoas-
says,  immunometric  assays,  or  liquid  chromatography  tandem  mass 
spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS).  LC-MS/MS  involves  extraction  of  serum 
by organic solvents, separation of testosterone from other steroids by 
high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, and 
quantitation  of  unique  testosterone  fragments  by  mass  spectrometry. 
LC-MS/MS  provides  accurate  and  sensitive  measurements  of  testos-
terone levels even in the low range and has emerged as the method of 
choice  for  testosterone  measurement.  The  use  of  LC-MS/MS  for  the 
measurement  of  testosterone  in  laboratories  that  have  been  certified 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Hormone 
Standardization Program for Testosterone (HoST) can ensure that tes-
tosterone measurements are accurate and calibrated to an international 
standard.  A  single  fasting  morning  sample  provides  a  good  approxi-
mation of the average testosterone concentration with the realization

that  testosterone  levels  fluctuate  because  of  its  pulsatile,  diurnal,  and 
circannual  secretory  rhythms.  Testosterone  is  generally  lower  in  the 
late afternoon and is reduced by acute illness. The harmonized normal 
range for total testosterone, measured using LC-MS/MS in nonobese 
populations  of  European  and  American  men  aged  19–39  years,  is 
264–916  ng/dL.  This  harmonized  reference  range  can  be  applied  to 
values from laboratories that are certified by the CDC’s HoST program.
Alterations in SHBG levels due to aging, obesity, diabetes mellitus, 
hyperthyroidism, some types of medications, or chronic illness, or on 
a congenital basis, can affect total testosterone levels. Heritable factors 
contribute substantially to the population-level variation in testoster-
one  levels,  and  genome-wide  association  studies  have  revealed  poly-
morphisms in the SHBG gene as important contributors to variation 
in testosterone levels.

Measurement  of  Unbound  Testosterone  Levels  Most  circu-
lating testosterone is bound to SHBG and to albumin; only 2.0–4% of 
circulating testosterone is unbound, or “free.” Free testosterone should 
ideally  be  measured  by  equilibrium  dialysis  under  standardized  con-
ditions using an accurate and reliable assay for total testosterone. The 
unbound testosterone concentration also can be calculated from total 
testosterone, SHBG, and albumin concentrations. Recent research has 
shown that testosterone binding to SHBG is a multistep process that 
involves complex allosteric interactions between the two binding sites 
within the SHBG dimer; a novel ensemble allosteric model of testos-
terone’s binding to SHBG dimers provides good estimates of free tes-
tosterone  concentrations.  The  previous  law-of-mass-action  equations 
based on linear models of testosterone binding to SHBG used assump-
tions that have been shown to be erroneous. Tracer analogue methods 
are  relatively  inexpensive  and  convenient,  but  they  are  inaccurate. 
The term bioavailable testosterone refers to unbound testosterone plus 
testosterone  bound  loosely  to  albumin  and  reflects  the  concept  that 
albumin-bound testosterone can dissociate at the capillary level, espe-
cially in tissues with long transit time, such as the liver and the brain. 
Bioavailable testosterone can be determined by the ammonium sulfate 
precipitation  method.  However,  the  measurements  of  bioavailable 
testosterone using the ammonium sulfate precipitation are technically 
challenging, susceptible to imprecision, and not recommended.

hCG Stimulation Test  The hCG stimulation test is performed by 
administering a single injection of 1500–4000 IU of hCG intramuscu-
larly and measuring testosterone levels at baseline and 24, 48, 72, and 
120 h after hCG injection. An alternative regimen involves three injec-
tions of 1500 units of hCG on successive days and measuring testoster-
one levels 24 h after the last dose. An acceptable response to hCG is a 
doubling of the testosterone concentration in adult men. In prepubertal 
boys, an increase in testosterone to >150 ng/dL indicates the presence 
of testicular tissue. No response may indicate an absence of testicular 
tissue or marked impairment of Leydig cell function. Measurement of 
MIS, a Sertoli cell product, is also used to detect the presence of testes 
in prepubertal boys with cryptorchidism.
 ■ SEMEN ANALYSIS
Semen  analysis  is  the  most  important  step  in  the  evaluation  of  male 
infertility.  Samples  are  collected  by  masturbation  following  a  period 
of  abstinence  for  2–3  days.  Semen  volumes  and  sperm  concentra-
tions  vary  considerably  among  fertile  men,  and  several  samples  may 
be  needed  before  concluding  that  the  results  are  abnormal.  Analysis 
should be performed within an hour of collection. Using semen sam-
ples  from  >4500  men  in  14  countries,  whose  partners  had  a  time  to 
pregnancy  of  <12  months,  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) 
has  generated  the  following  one-sided  reference  limits  for  semen 
parameters: semen volume, 1.5 mL; total sperm number, 39 million per 
ejaculate;  sperm  concentration,  15  million  per  mL;  vitality,  58%  live; 
progressive motility, 32%; total (progressive + nonprogressive) motility, 
40%;  and  morphologically  normal  forms,  4.0%.  Some  men  with  low 
sperm counts are nevertheless fertile. Some studies suggest that sperm 
counts  have  declined  in  recent  decades.  A  variety  of  tests  for  sperm 
function  can  be  performed  in  specialized  laboratories,  but  these  add 
relatively little to the treatment options.

 ■ TESTICULAR BIOPSY
Testicular biopsy is useful in some patients with oligospermia or azoo-
spermia as an aid in diagnosis and indication for the feasibility of treat-
ment.  Using  fine-needle  aspiration  biopsy  is  performed  under  local 
anesthesia to aspirate tissue for histology. Alternatively, open biopsies 
can be performed under local or general anesthesia when more tissue is 
required. A normal biopsy in an azoospermic man with a normal FSH 
level suggests obstruction of the vas deferens, which may be correct-
able surgically. Biopsies are also used to harvest sperm for ICSI and to 
classify disorders such as hypospermatogenesis (all stages present but 
in reduced numbers), germ cell arrest (usually at primary spermatocyte 
stage), and Sertoli cell–only syndrome (absent germ cells) or hyaliniza-
tion (sclerosis with absent cellular elements).

Testing  for  Y  Chromosome  Microdeletions  Y  chromosome 
microdeletions are detected by extracting DNA from peripheral blood 
leukocytes  and  using polymerase chain  reaction  (PCR)  amplification 
using primers for ~300 sequence-tagged sites on the Y chromosome, 
followed  by  gel  electrophoresis  to  determine  whether  the  DNA 
sequences  corresponding  to  the  selected  Y  chromosome  markers 
are  present.  However,  because  these  ~300  Y  chromosome  markers 
account for only a small fraction of the 23 million base pairs on the Y 
chromosome, a negative test does not exclude microdeletions in other 
subregions of the Y chromosome.

DISORDERS OF SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION
See Chap. 390.

DISORDERS OF PUBERTY
The onset and tempo of puberty vary greatly in the general population 
and  are  affected  by  genetic,  nutritional,  and  environmental  factors. 
Although a substantial fraction of the variance in the timing of puberty 
is explained by heritable factors, the genes involved remain unknown.

 ■ PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY
Puberty in boys aged <9 years is considered precocious. Earlier onset 
of  puberty  is  associated  with  increased  risk  for  several  cancers,  car-
diovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hair pigmentation, 
and  shorter  life  span.  Genome-wide  association  studies  for  age  of 
menarche in girls and age of voice deepening in boys have identified 
389 independent loci in girls and 76 independent loci for the timing of 
puberty in boys.

Isosexual precocity refers to premature sexual development consis-
tent  with  phenotypic  sex  and  includes  features  such  as  the  develop-
ment of facial hair and phallic growth. Isosexual precocity is divided 
into  gonadotropin-dependent  and  gonadotropin-independent  causes 
of androgen excess (Table 391-1). Heterosexual precocity refers to the 
premature development of estrogenic features in boys, such as breast 
development.

Gonadotropin-Dependent  Precocious  Puberty  This  disor-
der,  called  central  precocious  puberty  (CPP),  is  less  common  in  boys 
than in girls. It is caused by premature activation of the GnRH pulse 
generator, sometimes because of central nervous system (CNS) lesions 
such  as  hypothalamic  hamartomas,  but  it  is  often  idiopathic.  CPP  is 
characterized by gonadotropin levels that are inappropriately elevated 
for  age.  Because  pituitary  priming  has  occurred,  GnRH  elicits  LH 
and FSH responses typical of those seen in puberty or in adults. MRI 
should be performed to exclude a mass, structural defect, infection, or 
inflammatory  process.  Mutations  in  kisspeptin,  kisspeptin  receptor, 
and MKRN3, an imprinted gene encoding makorin ring finger protein 
3,  which  is  expressed  only  from  the  paternally  inherited  allele,  have 
been  associated  with  CPP.  Loss-of-function  mutations  in  MKRN3 
remove the brake that restrains pulsatile GnRH, resulting in precocious 
puberty.

Gonadotropin-Independent Precocious Puberty  Androgens 
from the testis or the adrenal are increased but gonadotropins are low. 
This  group  of  disorders  includes  hCG-secreting  tumors;  CAH;  sex 
steroid–producing tumors of the testis, adrenal, and ovary; accidental or

deliberate exogenous sex steroid administration; hypothyroidism; and 
activating mutations of the LH receptor or Gsα subunit.
Familial  Male-Limited  Precocious  Puberty  Also  called  tes-
totoxicosis,  familial  male-limited  precocious  puberty  is  an  autosomal 
dominant disorder caused by activating mutations in the LH receptor, 
leading  to  constitutive  stimulation  of  the  cyclic  AMP  pathway  and 
testosterone production. Clinical features include premature androge-
nization in boys, growth acceleration in early childhood, and advanced 
bone  age  followed  by  premature  epiphyseal  fusion.  Testosterone  is 
elevated, and LH is suppressed. Treatment options include inhibitors 
of testosterone synthesis (e.g., ketoconazole, medroxyprogesterone ace-
tate), AR antagonists (e.g., flutamide and bicalutamide), and aromatase 
inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole).
MCCUNE-ALBRIGHT  SYNDROME  This  is  a  sporadic  disorder  caused 
by somatic (postzygotic) activating mutations in the Gsα subunit that 
links G protein–coupled receptors to intracellular signaling pathways 
(Chap.  412).  The  mutations  impair  the  guanosine  triphosphatase 
activity of the Gsα protein, leading to ligand-independent signaling of 
the Gs-coupled receptor and constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase. 
Like activating LH receptor mutations, this stimulates testosterone pro-
duction and causes gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty. In 
addition to sexual precocity, affected individuals may have autonomy 
in  the  adrenals,  pituitary,  and  thyroid  glands.  Café  au  lait  spots  are 
characteristic skin lesions that reflect the onset of the somatic muta-
tions  in  melanocytes  during  embryonic  development.  Constitutive 

Gsα activation in the postnatal multipotent skeletal stem cells leads to 
the formation of immature woven bone and replacement of the bone 
marrow with fibrotic stroma (polyostotic fibrous dysplasia). Treatment 
is  similar  to  that  in  patients  with  activating  LH  receptor  mutations. 
Bisphosphonates have been used to treat bone lesions.
CONGENITAL  ADRENAL  HYPERPLASIA  Boys  with  CAH  who  are  not 
well controlled with glucocorticoid suppression of adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH) can develop premature virilization because of exces-
sive androgen production by the adrenal gland (Chaps. 386 and 390). 
LH is low, and the testes are small. Adrenal rests may develop within 
the testis of poorly controlled patients with CAH because of chronic 
ACTH  stimulation;  adrenal  rests  do  not  require  surgical  removal 
and regress with effective glucocorticoid therapy. Some children with 
CAH may develop gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty with 
early maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, elevated 
gonadotropins, and testicular growth.

Heterosexual Sexual Precocity  Breast enlargement in prepuber-
tal boys can result from familial aromatase excess, estrogen-producing 
tumors in the adrenal gland, Sertoli cell tumors in the testis, marijuana 
smoking, or exogenous estrogens or androgens. Occasionally, germ cell 
tumors that secrete hCG can be associated with breast enlargement due 
to  excessive  stimulation  of  estrogen  production  (see  “Gynecomastia,” 
below).

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Precocious Puberty
After  verification  of  precocious  development,  serum  testos-
terone,  LH,  and  FSH  levels  should  be  measured  to  determine 
whether gonadotropins are increased in relation to chronologic age 
(gonadotropin-dependent) or whether sex steroid secretion is occur-
ring independent of LH and FSH (gonadotropin-independent). In 
children  with  gonadotropin-dependent  precocious  puberty,  CNS 
lesions  should  be  excluded  by  history,  neurologic  examination, 
and  MRI  scan  of  the  head.  If  organic  causes  are  not  found,  one 
is  left  with  the  diagnosis  of  idiopathic  central  precocity.  Patients 
with  high  testosterone  but  suppressed  LH  concentrations  have 
gonadotropin-independent  sexual  precocity;  in  these  patients, 
DHEA  sulfate  (DHEAS)  and  17α-hydroxyprogesterone  should  be 
measured.  High  levels  of  testosterone  and  17α-hydroxyproges-
terone  suggest  the  possibility  of  CAH  due  to  21α-hydroxylase  or   
11β-hydroxylase  deficiency.  If  testosterone  and  DHEAS  are  ele-
vated, adrenal tumors should be excluded by obtaining a CT scan of 
the adrenal glands. Patients with elevated testosterone but without 
increased  17α-hydroxyprogesterone  or  DHEAS  should  undergo 
careful evaluation of the testis by palpation and ultrasound to exclude 
a  Leydig  cell  neoplasm.  Activating  mutations  of  the  LH  receptor 
should be considered in children with gonadotropin-independent 
precocious  puberty  in  whom  CAH,  androgen  abuse,  and  adrenal 
and testicular neoplasms have been excluded.

TREATMENT
Precocious Puberty

In patients with a known cause (e.g., a CNS lesion or a testicular 
tumor), therapy should be directed toward the underlying disorder. 
In patients with idiopathic CPP, treatment with long-acting GnRH 
analogues is indicated in boys showing rapid pubertal progression, 
who  are  more  advanced  in  pubertal  development  (e.g.,  Tanner 
stage  3  or  greater  genital  development)  and  experiencing  rapid 
linear growth apparent at their first visit. GnRH analogues suppress 
gonadotropins  and  testosterone,  halt  early  pubertal  development, 
delay accelerated bone maturation, prevent early epiphyseal closure, 
promote  final  height  gain,  and  mitigate  the  psychosocial  conse-
quences of early pubertal development without causing osteoporo-
sis. The treatment is most effective for increasing final adult height

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismif it is initiated before age 6. Puberty resumes after discontinuation 
of  the  GnRH  analogue.  Counseling  is  an  important  aspect  of  the 
overall treatment strategy.

In children with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty, 
inhibitors of steroidogenesis, such as ketoconazole, AR antagonists, 
and  aromatase  inhibitors  have  been  used  empirically.  Long-term 
treatment  with  spironolactone  (a  weak  androgen  antagonist)  and 
ketoconazole  has  been  reported  to  normalize  growth  rate  and 
bone  maturation  and  to  improve  predicted  height  in  small,  non-
randomized  trials  in  boys  with  familial  male-limited  precocious 
puberty.  Aromatase  inhibitors,  such  as  testolactone  and  letrozole, 
have  been  used  as  adjuncts  to  antiandrogen  therapy  for  children 
with familial male-limited precocious puberty, CAH, and McCune- 
Albright  syndrome.  More  potent  novel  inhibitors  of  testosterone 
synthesis, such as abiraterone, have not been evaluated in boys with 
gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty.

 ■ DELAYED PUBERTY
Puberty is considered delayed in boys if it has not ensued by age 14, 
an  age  that  is  2–2.5  standard  deviations  above  the  mean  for  healthy 
children.  Pubertal  delay  is  not  necessarily  pathologic  and  may  be  a 
variant  of  normal  pubertal  development  in  some  children.  Delayed 
puberty has been associated with lower peak bone mass, higher risk for 
metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, and lower risk for breast and 
endometrial cancer in women.

Delayed puberty is more common in boys than in girls. There are four 
main categories of delayed puberty: (1) constitutional delay of growth 
and puberty (~60% of cases); (2) functional hypogonadotropic hypogo-
nadism caused by systemic illness or malnutrition (~20% of cases); (3) 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism caused by genetic or acquired defects 
in the hypothalamic-pituitary region (~10% of cases); and (4) hypergo-
nadotropic hypogonadism secondary to primary gonadal failure (~15% 
of cases) (Table 391-1). The constitutional delay of growth and puberty 
is the most common cause that accounts for nearly two-thirds of boys 
and one-third of girls with delayed puberty. The constitutional delay of 
growth and puberty clusters in families and displays a complex inheri-
tance pattern, having an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in 
some families, but autosomal recessive, X-linked, or bilineal pattern in 
other families. Only rarely have mutations in genes known to disrupt 
the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis  been  identified  in  cases  of 
pubertal delay; most of these mutations have been reported in relatives 
of  patients  with  idiopathic  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism.  Func-
tional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is more common in girls than 
in boys. Permanent causes of hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic 
hypogonadism are identified in <25% of boys with delayed puberty.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Delayed Puberty

History  of  systemic  illness,  eating  disorders,  excessive  exercise, 
social and psychological problems, and abnormal patterns of linear 
growth  during  childhood  should  be  verified.  Boys  with  pubertal 
delay may have accompanying emotional and physical immaturity 
relative  to  their  peers,  which  can  be  a  source  of  anxiety.  Physical 
examination should focus on height; arm span; weight; visual fields; 
and secondary sex characteristics, including hair growth, testicular 
volume, phallic size, and scrotal reddening and thinning. Testicular 
size >2.5 cm generally indicates that the child has entered puberty.
The main diagnostic challenge is to distinguish those with con-
stitutional delay, who will progress through puberty at a later age, 
from those with an underlying pathologic process. Constitutional 
delay should be suspected when there is a family history and when 
there are delayed bone age and short stature. Pituitary priming by 
pulsatile GnRH is required before LH and FSH are synthesized and 
secreted  normally.  Thus,  blunted  responses  to  exogenous  GnRH 
can  be  seen  in  patients  with  constitutional  delay,  GnRH  defi-
ciency, or pituitary disorders. On the other hand, low-normal basal 

gonadotropin  levels  or  a  normal  response  to  exogenous  GnRH  is 
consistent with an early stage of puberty, which is often heralded by 
nocturnal GnRH secretion. Thus, constitutional delay is a diagno-
sis of exclusion that requires ongoing evaluation until the onset of 
puberty and the growth spurt.

3013

TREATMENT
Delayed Puberty

If  therapy  is  considered  appropriate,  it  can  begin  with  25–50  mg 
of  testosterone  enanthate  or  testosterone  cypionate  every  2  weeks 
or by using a 2.5-mg testosterone patch or 25-mg testosterone gel. 
Because  aromatization  of  testosterone  to  estrogen  is  obligatory 
for  mediating  androgen  effects  on  epiphyseal  fusion,  concomi-
tant treatment with aromatase inhibitors may allow attainment of 
greater final adult height. Testosterone treatment should be inter-
rupted  after  6  months  to  determine  if  endogenous  LH  and  FSH 
secretion have ensued. Other causes of delayed puberty should be 
considered when there are associated clinical features or when boys 
do not enter puberty spontaneously after a year of observation or 
treatment.

Reassurance  without  hormonal  treatment  is  appropriate  for 
many  individuals  with  presumed  constitutional  delay  of  puberty. 
However,  the  impact  of  delayed  growth  and  pubertal  progression 
on a child’s social relationships and school performance should be 
weighed.  Boys  with  constitutional  delay  of  puberty  are  less  likely 
to  achieve  their  full  genetic  height  potential  and  have  reduced 
total body bone mass as adults, mainly due to narrow limb bones 
and  vertebrae  as  a  result  of  impaired  periosteal  expansion  during 
puberty.  Furthermore,  the  time  of  onset  of  puberty  is  negatively 
associated with bone mineral content and density in boys at skeletal 
maturity.  Judicious  use  of  androgen  therapy  in  carefully  selected 
boys  with  constitutional  delay  can  induce  pubertal  induction  and 
progression  and  promote  short-term  growth  without  compromis-
ing final height, and when administered with an aromatase inhibi-
tor, it may improve final height.

DISORDERS OF THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE 
AXIS DURING ADULTHOOD
 ■ HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM
Because  LH  and  FSH  are  trophic  hormones  for  the  testes,  impaired 
secretion of these pituitary gonadotropins results in secondary hypo-
gonadism,  which  is  characterized  by  low  testosterone  in  the  setting 
of  low  or  inappropriately  normal  LH  and  FSH.  Those  with  the  most 
severe  gonadotropin  deficiency  have  complete  absence  of  pubertal 
development, sexual infantilism, and, in some cases, hypospadias and 
undescended testes. Patients with partial gonadotropin deficiency have 
delayed or arrested sex development. The 24-h LH secretory profiles 
are heterogeneous in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, 
reflecting variable abnormalities of LH pulse frequency or amplitude. 
In severe cases, basal LH is low, and there are no LH pulses. A smaller 
subset of patients has low-amplitude LH pulses or markedly reduced 
pulse  frequency.  Occasionally,  only  sleep-entrained  LH  pulses  occur, 
reminiscent of the pattern seen in the early stages of puberty. Hypo-
gonadotropic  hypogonadism  can  be  classified  into  congenital  and 
acquired  disorders.  Congenital  disorders  most  commonly  involve 
GnRH  deficiency,  which  leads  to  gonadotropin  deficiency.  Acquired 
disorders are much more common than congenital disorders and may 
result from a variety of sellar mass lesions or infiltrative diseases of the 
hypothalamus or pituitary or be due to the effects of drugs, nutritional 
or psychiatric disorders, or systemic diseases.
Congenital  Disorders  Associated  with  Gonadotropin  
Deficiency  (See  Chap.  379)  Congenital  hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by 
decreased gonadotropin secretion and testicular dysfunction either due 
to impaired function of the GnRH pulse generator or the gonadotrope.

3014 The disorders characterized by GnRH deficiency represent a family of 
oligogenic  disorders  whose  phenotype  spans  a  wide  spectrum.  Some 
individuals with GnRH deficiency may suffer from complete absence 
of  pubertal  development,  while  others  may  manifest  varying  degrees 
of gonadotropin deficiency and pubertal delay, and a subset that car-
ries  the  same  mutations  as  their  affected  family  members  may  even 
have  normal  reproductive  function.  In  ~10%  of  men  with  idiopathic 
hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  (IHH),  reversal  of  gonadotropin 
deficiency may occur in adult life after sex steroid therapy. Also, a small 
fraction of men with IHH may present with androgen deficiency and 
infertility  in  adult  life  after  having  gone  through  apparently  normal 
pubertal development. Nutritional, emotional, or metabolic stress may 
unmask  gonadotropin  deficiency  and  reproductive  dysfunction  (e.g., 
hypothalamic amenorrhea) in some patients who harbor mutations in 
the candidate genes but who previously had normal reproductive func-
tion. The clinical phenotype may include isolated anosmia or hypos-
mia. Oligogenicity and gene-gene and gene-environment interactions 
may contribute to variations in clinical phenotype.

Mutations in a number of genes involved in the development and 
migration  of  GnRH  neurons  or  in  the  regulation  of  GnRH  secretion 
have  been  linked  to  GnRH  deficiency,  although  the  genetic  defect 
remains  elusive  in  nearly  two-thirds  of  cases.  Familial  hypogonad-
otropic  hypogonadism  can  be  transmitted  as  an  X-linked  (20%), 
autosomal recessive (30%), or autosomal dominant (50%) trait. Some 
individuals with IHH have sporadic mutations in the same genes that 
cause  inherited  forms  of  the  disorder.  The  genetic  defects  associated 
with  GnRH  deficiency  can  ben  conveniently  classified  as  anosmic 
(Kallmann  syndrome)  or  normosmic  (Table  391-2),  although  the 
occurrence  of  both  anosmic  and  normosmic  forms  of  GnRH  defi-
ciency in the same families suggests commonality of pathophysiologic 
mechanisms.  Kallmann  syndrome,  the  anosmic  form  of  GnRH  defi-
ciency, can result from mutations in one or more neurodevelopmental 
genes associated with olfactory bulb morphogenesis or the migration 
of GnRH neurons from their origin in the region of the olfactory pla-
code,  along  the  scaffold  established  by  the  olfactory  nerves,  through 
the  cribriform  plate  into  their  final  location  into  the  preoptic  region 
of the hypothalamus. Thus, mutations in KAL1, NMDA receptor syn-
aptonuclear  signaling  and  neuronal  migration  factor  (NSMF),  genes 
involved  in  fibroblast  growth  factor  (FGF)  signaling  (FGF8,  FGFR1, 
FGF17,  IL17RD,  DUSP6,  SPRY4,  and  FLRT3),  NELF,  genes  involved 
in  PROK  signaling  (PROK2  and  PROK2R),  WDR11,  SOX10,  TUBB3 
SEMA3, HS6ST1, CHD7, and FEZF1 have been described in patients 
with  Kallmann  syndrome.  An  X-linked  form  of  IHH  is  caused  by 
mutations in the KAL1 gene, which encodes anosmin, a protein that 
mediates the migration of neural progenitors of the olfactory bulb and 
GnRH-producing  neurons.  These  individuals  have  GnRH  deficiency 
and variable combinations of anosmia or hyposmia, renal defects, and 
neurologic abnormalities including mirror movements. Proteins such 
as those involved in FGF and prokineticin signaling and KAL1, which 
account  for  the  great  majority  of  Kallmann  syndrome  cases,  interact 
with heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycan compounds within the extra-
cellular matrix in supporting GnRH neuronal migration. Mutations in 
the FGFR1 gene cause an autosomal dominant form of hypogonado-
tropic  hypogonadism  that  clinically  resembles  Kallmann  syndrome; 
mutations in its putative ligand, the FGF8 gene product, have also been 
associated  with  IHH.  Craniofacial  tissues  and  olfactory  ensheathing 
cells  also  play  important  roles  in  neurogenesis  and  migration  of  the 
GnRH neurons, and additional proteins that regulate these cell types 
may also be involved in the pathogenesis of Kallmann syndrome. The 
co-occurrence of tooth anomalies, cleft palate, craniofacial anomalies, 
pigmentation, and neurologic defects in patients with Kallmann syn-
drome suggests that the syndrome may be a part of the spectrum of 
neurocristopathies.  Other  dysmorphic  features  associated  with  some 
forms  of  IHH  include  renal  agenesis,  hearing  loss,  synkinesia,  short 
metacarpals, eye movement abnormalities, cerebellar ataxia, and dental 
agenesis. The presence of these dysmorphic features can offer clues to 
the underlying genetic abnormality and guide genetic testing.

Normosmic  GnRH  deficiency  results  from  defects  in  pulsatile 
GnRH secretion, its regulation, or its action on the gonadotrope and 

has  been  associated  with  mutations  in  GnRHR,  GNRH1,  KISS1R, 
TAC3,  TACR3,  NROB1  (DAX1),  leptin,  or  leptin  receptor.  Some 
mutations,  such  as  those  in  PROK2,  PROKR2,  NSMF,  FGFR1,  FGF8, 
SEMA3A, WDR11, and CHD7, have been associated with both anos-
mic and normosmic forms of IHH; it is possible that these genes are 
involved in GnRH neuronal migration as well in regulation of GnRH 
secretion.  GnRHR  mutations,  the  most  frequent  identifiable  cause  of 
normosmic  IHH,  account  for  ~40%  of  autosomal  recessive  and  10% 
of sporadic cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. These patients 
have  decreased  LH  response  to  exogenous  GnRH.  Some  receptor 
mutations  alter  GnRH  binding  affinity,  allowing  apparently  normal 
responses to pharmacologic doses of exogenous GnRH, whereas other 
mutations may alter signal transduction downstream of hormone bind-
ing. Mutations of the GnRH1 gene have also been reported in patients 
with  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism,  although  they  are  rare.  The 
G  protein–coupled  receptor  KISS1R  (GPR54)  and  its  cognate  ligand, 
kisspeptin  (KISS1),  are  important  regulators  of  sexual  maturation  in 
primates.  Recessive  mutations  in  GPR54  cause  gonadotropin  defi-
ciency  without  anosmia.  Patients  retain  responsiveness  to  exogenous 
GnRH, suggesting an abnormality in the neural pathways controlling 
GnRH release. The genes encoding NKB (TAC3), which is involved in 
preferential activation of GnRH release in early development, and its 
receptor (TAC3R) have been implicated in some families with normos-
mic IHH. The neurokinin pathway plays an important role in GnRH 
activation  during  “mini-puberty”  as  well  as  in  puberty.  Prokineticin 
2  (PROK2)  and  its  receptor  (PROK2R)  are  highly  expressed  in  the 
olfactory ventricle and subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and 
are associated with neurogenesis of the olfactory bulbs and the migra-
tion of the olfactory neuronal cells. Mutations in the CHD7 gene that 
encodes for the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 causes 
CHARGE syndrome characterized by eye coloboma, heart anomalies, 
choanal atresia, growth and developmental retardation, genitourinary 
anomalies,  hypogonadism,  and  ear  abnormalities.  X-linked  hypogo-
nadotropic hypogonadism also occurs in adrenal hypoplasia congenita, 
a  disorder  caused  by  mutations  in  the  DAX1  gene,  which  encodes  a 
nuclear receptor in the adrenal gland and reproductive axis. Adrenal 
hypoplasia  congenita  is  characterized  by  absent  development  of  the 
adult zone of the adrenal cortex, leading to neonatal adrenal insuffi-
ciency. Puberty usually does not occur or is arrested, reflecting variable 
degrees of gonadotropin deficiency. Although sexual differentiation is 
normal, some patients have testicular dysgenesis and impaired sperma-
togenesis despite gonadotropin replacement. Less commonly, adrenal 
hypoplasia congenita, sex reversal, and hypogonadotropic hypogonad-
ism can be caused by mutations of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1). Rarely, 
recessive mutations in the LHβ or FSHβ genes have been described in 
patients with selective deficiencies of these gonadotropins.

A  number  of  homeodomain  transcription  factors  are  involved 
in  the  development  and  differentiation  of  the  specialized  hormone- 
producing cells within the pituitary gland (Table 391-2). Patients with 
mutations of PROP1 have combined pituitary hormone deficiency that 
includes  GH,  prolactin  (PRL),  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  (TSH), 
LH, and FSH, but not ACTH. LHX3 mutations cause combined pitu-
itary  hormone  deficiency  in  association  with  cervical  spine  rigidity. 
HESX1 mutations cause septo-optic dysplasia and combined pituitary 
hormone deficiency. Mutations of ARNT1, inherited as an autosomal 
recessive disorder, are associated with diabetes insipidus; ACTH, GH, 
LH,  and  FSH  deficiency;  anterior  pituitary  hypoplasia;  hypoplastic 
frontal and temporal lobes; thin corpus callosum; prominent forehead; 
and  retrognathia.  Patients  with  SOX2  mutations  can  have  gonado-
tropin  deficiency,  variable  deficiencies  of  TSH  and  ACTH,  pituitary 
hypoplasia, microphthalmia, and intellectual disability.

Prader-Willi  syndrome  (PWS)  is  characterized  by  obesity,  hypo-
tonic  musculature,  intellectual  disability,  hypogonadism,  short  stat-
ure, and small hands and feet. Prader-Willi syndrome is a genomic 
imprinting  disorder  caused  by  deletions  of  the  proximal  portion 
of  the  paternally  derived  chromosome  15q11-15q13  region,  which 
contains  a  bipartite  imprinting  center;  uniparental  disomy  of  the 
maternal alleles; or mutations of the genes/loci involved in imprint-
ing (Chap. 466). Recent studies suggest that at least some of the major

Laurence-Moon  syndrome is  an autosomal recessive disorder char-
acterized  by  obesity,  hypogonadism,  mental  retardation,  polydactyly, 
and retinitis pigmentosa. Recessive mutations of leptin, or its receptor, 
cause severe obesity and pubertal arrest, apparently because of hypo-
thalamic GnRH deficiency (Chap. 401).

Acquired  Hypogonadotropic  Disorders  •  SEVERE  ILLNESS, 
STRESS,  MALNUTRITION,  AND  EXERCISE  These  may  cause  revers-
ible  gonadotropin  deficiency.  Although  gonadotropin  deficiency  and 
reproductive dysfunction are well documented in these conditions in 
women,  men  exhibit  similar  but  less  pronounced  responses.  Unlike 
women, most male runners and other endurance athletes have normal 
gonadotropin and sex steroid levels, despite low body fat and frequent 
intensive  exercise.  Testosterone  levels  fall  at  the  onset  of  illness  and 
recover during recuperation. The magnitude of gonadotropin suppres-
sion  generally  correlates  with  the  severity  of  illness.  Although  hypo-
gonadotropic hypogonadism is the most common cause of androgen 
deficiency  in  patients  with  acute  illness,  some  have  elevated  levels 
of  LH  and  FSH,  which  suggest  primary  gonadal  dysfunction.  The 
pathophysiology  of  reproductive  dysfunction  during  acute  illness  is 
unknown but likely involves a combination of cytokine and/or gluco-
corticoid effects. There is a high frequency of low testosterone levels in 
patients with chronic illnesses such as HIV infection, end-stage renal 
disease,  chronic  obstructive  lung  disease,  and  many  types  of  cancer 
and in patients receiving glucocorticoids. About 20% of HIV-infected 
men  with  low  testosterone  levels  have  elevated  LH  and  FSH  levels; 
these  patients  presumably  have  primary  testicular  dysfunction.  The 
remaining  80%  have  either  normal  or  low  LH  and  FSH  levels;  these 
men  have  a  central  hypothalamic-pituitary  defect  or  a  dual  defect 
involving  both  the  testis  and  the  hypothalamic-pituitary  centers. 
Muscle wasting is common in chronic diseases associated with hypo-
gonadism, which also leads to debility, poor quality of life, and adverse 
outcome of disease. There is great interest in exploring strategies that 
can reverse androgen deficiency or attenuate the sarcopenia associated 
with chronic illness.

Men  using  opioids  for  relief  of  cancer  or  noncancerous  pain  or 
because of addiction often have suppressed testosterone and LH levels 
and high prevalence of sexual dysfunction and osteoporosis; the degree 
of suppression is dose-related and particularly severe with long-acting 
opioids  such  as  methadone.  Opioids  suppress  GnRH  secretion  and 
alter  the  sensitivity  to  feedback  inhibition  by  gonadal  steroids.  Men 
who are heavy users of marijuana have decreased testosterone secretion 
and sperm production. The mechanism of marijuana-induced hypogo-
nadism is decreased GnRH secretion. Gynecomastia observed in mari-
juana users can also be caused by plant estrogens in crude preparations. 
Androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer has been 
associated with increased risk of bone fractures, diabetes mellitus, car-
diovascular  events,  fatigue,  sexual  dysfunction,  tender  gynecomastia, 
and poor quality of life.

OBESITY  In men with mild to moderate obesity, SHBG levels decrease 
in proportion to the degree of obesity, resulting in lower total testos-
terone levels. However, free testosterone levels usually remain within 
the normal range. SHBG production in the liver is inhibited by hepatic 
lipids  and  by  tumor  necrosis  factor  α  and  interleukin  1,  but  it  is  not 
affected by insulin. Thus, the low SHBG levels seen in obesity and dia-
betes are likely the result of low-grade inflammation and the increased 
amount of hepatic lipids rather than high insulin levels. Estradiol lev-
els are higher in obese men compared to healthy, nonobese controls, 
because of aromatization of testosterone to estradiol in adipose tissue. 
Weight loss is associated with reversal of these abnormalities including 
an increase in total and free testosterone levels and a decrease in est-
radiol levels. A subset of obese men with moderate to severe obesity 
may have a defect in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis as suggested by 
low free testosterone in the absence of elevated gonadotropins. Weight 
gain in adult men can accelerate the rate of age-related decline in tes-
tosterone levels.

HYPERPROLACTINEMIA  (See  also  Chap.  380)  Elevated  PRL  levels 
are  associated  with  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism.  PRL  inhibits 
hypothalamic  GnRH  secretion  either  directly  or  through  modula-
tion  of  tuberoinfundibular  dopaminergic  pathways.  A  PRL-secreting 
tumor may also destroy the surrounding gonadotropes by invasion or 
compression of the pituitary stalk. Treatment with dopamine agonists 
reverses gonadotropin deficiency, although there may be a delay rela-
tive to PRL suppression.

SELLAR  MASS  LESIONS  Neoplastic  and  nonneoplastic  lesions  in  the 
hypothalamus  or  pituitary  can  directly  or  indirectly  affect  gonado-
trope  function.  In  adults,  pituitary  adenomas  constitute  the  largest 
category of space-occupying lesions affecting gonadotropin and other 
pituitary  hormone  production.  Pituitary  adenomas  that  extend  into 
the suprasellar region can impair GnRH secretion and mildly increase 
PRL secretion (usually <50 μg/L) because of impaired tonic inhibition 
by dopaminergic pathways. These tumors that cause hyperprolactine-
mia by stalk compression should be distinguished from prolactinomas, 
which  typically  are  associated  with  higher  PRL  levels.  The  presence 
of diabetes insipidus suggests the possibility of a craniopharyngioma, 
infiltrative disorder, or other hypothalamic lesions (Chap. 381).

HEMOCHROMATOSIS  (See also Chap. 414) Both the pituitary and tes-
tis can be affected by excessive iron deposition. However, the pituitary 
defect is the predominant lesion in most patients with hemochromato-
sis and hypogonadism. The diagnosis of hemochromatosis is suggested 
by the association of characteristic skin discoloration, hepatic enlarge-
ment  or  dysfunction,  diabetes  mellitus,  arthritis,  cardiac  conduction 
defects, and hypogonadism.

 ■ PRIMARY TESTICULAR CAUSES OF 
HYPOGONADISM
Common causes of primary testicular dysfunction include Klinefelter 
syndrome,  uncorrected  cryptorchidism,  cancer  chemotherapy,  radia-
tion  to  the  testes,  trauma,  torsion,  infectious  orchitis,  HIV  infection, 
anorchia  syndrome,  and  myotonic  dystrophy.  Primary  testicular  dis-
orders  may  be  associated  with  impaired  spermatogenesis,  decreased 
androgen production, or both. See Chap. 390 for disorders of testis 
development, androgen synthesis, and androgen action.

Klinefelter Syndrome 
(See also Chap. 390) Klinefelter syndrome 
is the most common chromosomal disorder associated with testicular 
dysfunction and male infertility. It occurs in about 1 in 600 live-born 
males. Azoospermia is the rule in men with Klinefelter syndrome who 
have  the  47,XXY  karyotype  due  to  the  progressive  loss  of  47,XXY 
spermatogonial  stem  cells;  however,  men  with  mosaicism  may  have 
germ  cells,  especially  at  a  younger  age.  The  clinical  phenotype  of 
Klinefelter syndrome can be variable, possibly because of mosaicism, 
polymorphisms in AR gene, the parental origin of the X chromosome, 
X-linked copy number variations, gene-dosage effects in conjunction 
with X chromosome inactivation, variable testosterone levels, or other 
genetic  factors.  Testicular  histology  shows  hyalinization  of  seminif-
erous  tubules  and  germ  cell  aplasia.  However,  spermatogenesis  can 
be observed in a small number of tubules from which sperm can be 
harvested  during  testicular  sperm  extraction  for  IVF.  Although  their 
function is impaired, the number of Leydig cells appears to increase. 
Testosterone is decreased and estradiol is increased, leading to clinical 
features  of  undervirilization  and  gynecomastia.  Men  with  Klinefel-
ter  syndrome  are  at  increased  risk  of  systemic  lupus  erythematosus, 
Sjögren’s syndrome, breast cancer, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and some types of lung cancer and at reduced 
risk of prostate cancer. Periodic mammography for breast cancer sur-
veillance is recommended for men with Klinefelter syndrome. Fertility 
can be achieved by intracytoplasmic injection of sperm retrieved surgi-
cally from the testes of men with Klinefelter syndrome, including some 
men with nonmosaic form of Klinefelter syndrome. Although sperm 
retrieval  for  fertility  preservation  offers  no  benefit  over  harvesting 
in  adulthood,  fertility  counseling,  including  the  potential  for  sperm 
retrieval, should be offered prior to starting testosterone replacement 
therapy. The karyotypes 48,XXXY and 49,XXXXY are associated with

a more severe phenotype, increased risk of congenital malformations, 
and lower intelligence than 47,XXY individuals.

Cryptorchidism  Cryptorchidism occurs when there is incomplete 
descent  of  the  testis  from  the  abdominal  cavity  into  the  scrotum. 
About 1–4% of full-term and 30% of premature male infants have at 
least one undescended testis at birth, but descent is usually complete 
by  the  first  few  weeks  of  life.  Fifty  percent  of  undescended  testes  at 
birth will descend spontaneously within the first 6–18 months of life; 
consequently, the incidence of cryptorchidism is <1% by 9 months of 
age. Cryptorchidism should be distinguished from retractile testes that 
can be pulled down into the scrotum during physical examination and 
require no treatment.

Androgens  regulate  predominantly  the  inguinoscrotal  descent  of 
the testes through degeneration of the cranio-suspensory ligament and 
a shortening of the gubernaculums, respectively. Mutations in INSL3 
and leucine-rich repeat family of G-protein-coupled receptor 8 (LGR8), 
which regulate the transabdominal portion of testicular descent, have 
been found in some patients with cryptorchidism.

Cryptorchidism  is  associated  with  increased  risk  of  malignancy, 
infertility,  inguinal  hernia,  and  torsion.  Unilateral  cryptorchidism, 
even  when  corrected  before  puberty,  is  associated  with  decreased 
sperm  count,  possibly  reflecting  unrecognized  damage  to  the  fully 
descended testis or other genetic factors. Therefore, surgical correction 
is usually performed between 6 and 18 months of age depending on 
the location of the testes, the child’s body size, and parental preference. 
Epidemiologic, clinical, and molecular evidence supports the idea that 
cryptorchidism,  hypospadias,  impaired  spermatogenesis,  and  testic-
ular cancer may be causally related to common genetic and environ-
ment  perturbations  and  are  components  of  the  testicular  dysgenesis 
syndrome.

Acquired  Testicular  Defects  Viral  orchitis  may  be  caused  by 
the  mumps  virus,  echovirus,  lymphocytic  choriomeningitis  virus, 
and group B arboviruses. Orchitis occurs in as many as one-fourth of 
adult men with mumps; the orchitis is unilateral in about two-thirds 
and  bilateral  in  the  remainder.  Orchitis  usually  develops  a  few  days 
after the onset of parotitis but may precede it. The testis may return to 
normal size and function or undergo atrophy. Semen analysis returns 
to  normal  for  three-fourths  of  men  with  unilateral  involvement  but 
for  only  one-third  of  men  with  bilateral  orchitis.  Trauma,  including 
testicular torsion, can also cause secondary atrophy of the testes. The 
exposed position of the testes in the scrotum renders them susceptible 
to both thermal and physical trauma, particularly in men with hazard-
ous occupations.

The  late-term  adverse  effects  of  cancer  treatment  on  reproductive 
health  have  emerged  as  an  important  concern  among  cancer  survi-
vors. Many professional cancer societies have published guidelines on 
the fertility preservation in patients with cancer and endorsed formal 
consideration  of  fertility  preservation  measures  prior  to  initiation  of 
cancer treatment. The testes are sensitive to radiation damage due to 
the  direct  effects  of  ionized  radioactive  particles  as  well  as  indirect 
effects of free radicals generated from water. Although radiation doses 
as low as 0.75 Gy can transiently raise LH, only doses >20 Gy are asso-
ciated with Leydig cell dysfunction and increased FSH and LH levels. 
Radiation doses <1.0 Gy are associated with only a transient decline in 
sperm density; doses between 1.0 and 2.0 Gy are associated with tem-
porary azoospermia, and doses >2.0 Gy are generally associated with 
permanent azoospermia. Permanent androgen deficiency in adult men 
is  uncommon  after  therapeutic  radiation;  however,  most  boys  given 
direct  testicular  radiation  therapy  for  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia 
have  permanently  low  testosterone  levels.  Direct  testicular  radiation 
and  whole-body  radiation  before  bone  marrow  transplantation  pose 
the greatest risk of permanent testicular damage.

Combination chemotherapy for acute leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease, 
and testicular and other cancers may impair Leydig cell function and 
cause  infertility.  The  degree  of  gonadal  dysfunction  depends  on  the 
type  of  chemotherapeutic  agent  and  the  dose  and  duration  of  ther-
apy.  Because  of  the  high  response  rates  and  the  young  age  of  these 

men,  infertility  and  androgen  deficiency  have  emerged  as  important 
long-term complications of cancer chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide 
and  combination  regimens  containing  alkylating  agents  such  as  pro-
carbazine are particularly toxic to germ cells. Thus, 90% of men with 
Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  receiving  MOPP  (mechlorethamine,  oncovin, 
procarbazine,  prednisone)  therapy  develop  azoospermia  or  extreme 
oligozoospermia;  newer  regimens  that  do  not  include  procarbazine, 
such as ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), are 
less  toxic  to  germ  cells.  Azoospermia  is  uncommon  with  cyclophos-
phamide equivalent doses of <4000 mg/m2, and higher doses of alky-
lating  agents  are  generally  associated  with  varying  degree  of  damage 
to  germ  cells.  The  outcomes  of  assisted  reproductive  technologies  in 
cancer survivors using cryopreserved sperm collected prior to cancer 
treatment are similar to those in infertile men who do not have cancer. 
A smaller subset of cancer survivors treated with large doses of alky-
lating agents may also suffer from testosterone deficiency and sexual 
dysfunction.

Drugs  interfere  with  testicular  function  by  several  mechanisms, 
including  inhibition  of  testosterone  synthesis  (e.g.,  ketoconazole), 
blockade  of  androgen  action  (e.g.,  spironolactone),  increased  estro-
gen  (e.g.,  marijuana),  and  toxic  effects  on  spermatogenesis  (e.g., 
chemotherapy).

Alcohol, when consumed in excess for prolonged periods, decreases 
testosterone,  independent  of  liver  disease  or  malnutrition.  Elevated 
estradiol  and  decreased  testosterone  levels  may  occur  in  men  taking 
digitalis.

The  occupational  and  recreational  history  should  be  carefully 
evaluated  in  all  men  with  infertility  because  of  the  toxic  effects  of 
many  chemical  agents  on  spermatogenesis.  Known  environmental 
hazards include pesticides (e.g., vinclozolin, dicofol, atrazine), sewage 
contaminants (e.g., ethinyl estradiol in birth control pills, surfactants 
such as octylphenol, nonylphenol), plasticizers (e.g., phthalates), flame 
retardants  (e.g.,  polychlorinated  biphenyls,  polybrominated  diphenol 
ethers), industrial pollutants (e.g., heavy metals such as cadmium and 
lead,  dioxins,  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons),  microwaves,  and 
ultrasound. In some populations, sperm density is said to have declined 
by as much as 40% in the past 50 years. Environmental estrogens or 
antiandrogens may be partly responsible.

Testicular failure also occurs as a part of polyglandular autoimmune 
insufficiency  (Chap.  388).  Sperm  antibodies  can  cause  isolated  male 
infertility. In some instances, these antibodies are secondary phenom-
ena  resulting  from  duct  obstruction  or  vasectomy.  Granulomatous 
diseases can affect the testes, and testicular atrophy occurs in 10–20% 
of men with lepromatous leprosy because of direct tissue invasion by 
the mycobacteria. The tubules are involved initially, followed by endar-
teritis and destruction of Leydig cells.

Systemic  disease  can  cause  primary  testis  dysfunction  in  addition 
to  suppressing  gonadotropin  production.  In  cirrhosis,  a  combined 
testicular  and  pituitary  abnormality  leads  to  decreased  testosterone 
production independent of the direct toxic effects of ethanol. Impaired 
hepatic extraction of adrenal androstenedione leads to extraglandular 
conversion  to  estrone  and  estradiol,  which  partially  suppresses  LH. 
Testicular atrophy and gynecomastia are present in approximately one-
half of men with cirrhosis. In chronic renal failure, androgen synthesis 
and  sperm  production  decrease  despite  elevated  gonadotropins.  The 
elevated LH level is due to reduced clearance, but it does not restore 
normal testosterone production. About one-fourth of men with renal 
failure have hyperprolactinemia. Improvement in testosterone produc-
tion  with  hemodialysis  is  incomplete,  but  successful  renal  transplan-
tation may return testicular function to normal. Testicular atrophy is 
present in one-third of men with sickle cell anemia. The defect may be 
at either the testicular or the hypothalamic-pituitary level. Sperm den-
sity can decrease temporarily after acute febrile illness in the absence 
of a change in testosterone production. Infertility in men with celiac 
disease is associated with a hormonal pattern typical of androgen resis-
tance, namely elevated testosterone and LH levels.

Neurologic  diseases  associated  with  altered  testicular  function 
include myotonic dystrophy, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and para-
plegia.  In  myotonic  dystrophy,  small  testes  may  be  associated  with

3018 impairment of both spermatogenesis and Leydig cell function. Spinob-
ulbar  muscular  atrophy  is  caused  by  an  expansion  of  the  glutamine 
repeat sequences in the amino-terminal region of the AR; this expan-
sion  impairs  function  of  the  AR,  but  it  is  unclear  how  the  alteration 
is  related  to  the  neurologic  manifestations.  Men  with  spinobulbar 
muscular atrophy often have undervirilization and infertility as a late 
manifestation. Spinal cord injury that causes paraplegia is often asso-
ciated with low testosterone levels and may cause persistent defects in 
spermatogenesis; some patients retain the capacity for penile erection 
and ejaculation.

 ■ ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY SYNDROMES
Mutations  in  the  AR  cause  resistance  to  the  action  of  testosterone 
and  DHT.  These  X-linked  mutations  are  associated  with  variable 
degrees  of  defective  male  phenotypic  development  and  underviril-
ization (Chap. 390). Although not technically hormone-insensitivity 
syndromes,  two  genetic  disorders  impair  testosterone  conversion  to 
active  sex  steroids.  Mutations  in  the  SRD5A2  gene,  which  encodes 
5α-reductase  type  2,  prevent  the  conversion  of  testosterone  to  DHT, 
which  is  necessary  for  the  normal  development  of  the  male  external 
genitalia. Mutations in the CYP19 gene, which encodes aromatase, pre-
vent testosterone conversion to estradiol. Males with CYP19 mutations 
have  delayed  epiphyseal  fusion,  tall  stature,  eunuchoid  proportions, 
visceral adiposity, and osteoporosis, consistent with evidence from an 
estrogen  receptor–deficient  individual  that  these  testosterone  actions 
are mediated via estrogen.

GYNECOMASTIA
Gynecomastia refers to enlargement of the male breast. It is caused by 
excess estrogen action and is usually the result of an increased estro-
gen/androgen  ratio.  True  gynecomastia  is  associated  with  glandular 
breast  tissue  that  is  >4  cm  in  diameter  and  often  tender.  Glandular 
tissue enlargement should be distinguished from excess adipose tissue: 
glandular tissue is firmer and contains fibrous-like cords. Gynecomas-
tia occurs as a normal physiologic phenomenon in the newborn (due 
to transplacental transfer of maternal and placental estrogens), during 
puberty (high estrogen-to-androgen ratio in early stages of puberty), 
and with aging (increased fat tissue and increased aromatase activity 
along with the age-related decline in testosterone levels), but it can also 
result from pathologic conditions associated with androgen deficiency 
or estrogen excess. The prevalence of gynecomastia increases with age 
and  body  mass  index  (BMI),  likely  because  of  increased  aromatase 
activity in adipose tissue. Medications that alter androgen metabolism 
or action may also cause gynecomastia. The relative risk of breast can-
cer is increased in men with gynecomastia, although the absolute risk 
is relatively small.

 ■ PATHOLOGIC GYNECOMASTIA
Any  cause  of  androgen  deficiency  can  lead  to  gynecomastia,  reflect-
ing  an  increased  estrogen/androgen  ratio,  as  estrogen  synthesis  still 
occurs  by  aromatization  of  residual  adrenal  and  gonadal  androgens. 
Gynecomastia  is  a  characteristic  feature  of  Klinefelter  syndrome 
(Chap. 390). Androgen insensitivity disorders also cause gynecomas-
tia.  Excess  estrogen  production  may  be  caused  by  tumors,  including 
Sertoli  cell  tumors  in  isolation  or  in  association  with  Peutz-Jeghers 
syndrome  or  Carney  complex.  Tumors  that  produce  hCG,  includ-
ing  some  testicular  tumors,  stimulate  Leydig  cell  estrogen  synthesis. 
Increased  conversion  of  androgens  to  estrogens  can  be  a  result  of 
increased availability of substrate (androstenedione) for extraglandu-
lar estrogen formation (CAH, hyperthyroidism, and most feminizing 
adrenal  tumors)  or  of  diminished  catabolism  of  androstenedione 
(liver disease) so that estrogen precursors are shunted to aromatase in 
peripheral sites. Obesity is associated with increased aromatization of 
androgen  precursors  to  estrogens.  Extraglandular  aromatase  activity 
can also be increased in tumors of the liver or adrenal gland or rarely 
as an inherited disorder. Several families with increased peripheral aro-
matase activity inherited as an autosomal dominant or as an X-linked 
disorder  have  been  described.  In  some  families  with  this  disorder, 
an inversion in chromosome 15q21.2-3 causes the CYP19 gene to be 

activated by the regulatory elements of contiguous genes, resulting in 
excessive estrogen production in the fat and other extragonadal tissues. 
The  familial  aromatase  excess  syndrome  due  to  CYP19  mutation  or 
chromosomal rearrangement is characterized by pre- or peripubertal 
onset of gynecomastia, advanced bone age, short adult height due to 
premature  epiphyseal  closure,  and  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism. 
Peutz-Jeghers  syndrome  is  characterized  by  intestinal  hamartomas, 
mucocutaneous pigmentation, calcifying Sertoli cell tumors, and pre-
pubertal gynecomastia due to increased aromatization and premature 
epiphyseal closure. Drugs can cause gynecomastia by acting directly as 
estrogenic  substances  (e.g.,  oral  contraceptives,  phytoestrogens,  dig-
italis)  or  inhibiting  androgen  synthesis  (e.g.,  ketoconazole)  or  action 
(e.g.,  spironolactone,  AR  blockers  such  as  enzalutamide);  for  many 
drugs,  such  as  cimetidine,  imatinib,  or  some  antiretroviral  drugs  for 
HIV,  the  precise  mechanism  is  unknown.  Unintentional  exposure  to 
estrogenic agents in skin care products has been reported as a cause of 
gynecomastia in prepubertal children.

Because  up  to  two-thirds  of  pubertal  boys  and  about  half  of  hos-
pitalized  men  have  palpable  glandular  tissue  that  is  benign,  detailed 
investigation  or  intervention  is  not  indicated  in  all  men  presenting 
with gynecomastia (Fig. 391-6). In addition to the extent of gyneco-
mastia,  recent  onset,  rapid  growth,  tender  tissue,  and  occurrence  in 
a lean subject should prompt more extensive evaluation. This should 
include  a  careful  drug  history,  measurement  and  examination  of  the 
testes,  assessment  of  virilization,  evaluation  of  liver  function,  and 
hormonal  measurements  including  testosterone,  estradiol,  andros-
tenedione, LH, and hCG. Markedly elevated estradiol concentrations 
along with suppressed LH should prompt a search for a testicular or 
adrenal estrogen-secreting tumor. A karyotype should be obtained in 
men  with  very  small  testes  to  exclude  Klinefelter  syndrome.  Despite

extensive evaluation, the etiology is established in fewer than one-half 
of patients.

TREATMENT
Gynecomastia
When  the  primary  cause  can  be  identified  and  corrected  shortly 
after the onset of gynecomastia, breast enlargement usually subsides 
over several months. However, if gynecomastia is of long duration, 
surgery is the most effective therapy. Indications for surgery include 
severe psychological and/or cosmetic problems, continued growth 
or  tenderness,  or  suspected  malignancy.  In  patients  who  have 
painful gynecomastia and in whom surgery cannot be performed, 
treatment  with  antiestrogens  such  as  tamoxifen  (20  mg/d)  can 
reduce  pain  and  breast  tissue  size  in  over  half  the  patients.  The 
estrogen receptor antagonists tamoxifen and raloxifene have been 
reported in small trials to reduce breast size in men with pubertal 
gynecomastia, although complete regression of breast enlargement 
is unusual with the use of estrogen receptor antagonists. Aromatase 
inhibitors  can  be  effective  in  the  early  proliferative  phase  of  the 
disorder. However, in a randomized trial in men with established 
gynecomastia, anastrozole proved no more effective than placebo in 
reducing breast size. Tamoxifen is effective in prevention and treat-
ment of breast enlargement and breast pain in men with prostate 
cancer who are receiving antiandrogen therapy.

AGING-RELATED CHANGES IN MALE 
REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION
A number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies (e.g., the Balti-
more Longitudinal Study of Aging, the Framingham Heart Study, the 
Massachusetts Male Aging Study, and the European Male Aging Study 
[EMAS])  have  established  that  testosterone  concentrations  decrease 
with advancing age. This age-related decline starts in the third decade 
of  life  and  progresses  slowly;  the  rate  of  decline  in  testosterone  con-
centrations is greater in obese men, in men with chronic illness, and 
in those taking medications. Because SHBG concentrations are higher 
in  older  men  than  in  younger  men,  free  or  bioavailable  testosterone 
concentrations decline with aging to a greater extent than total testos-
terone concentrations. The age-related decline in testosterone is due to 
defects at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis: pulsa-
tile GnRH secretion is attenuated, LH response to GnRH is reduced, 
and  testicular  response  to  LH  is  impaired.  However,  the  gradual  rise 
of  LH  with  aging  suggests  that  testis  dysfunction  is  the  main  cause 
of  declining  androgen  levels.  The  term  andropause  has  been  used  to 
denote age-related decline in testosterone concentrations; this term is a 
misnomer because there is no discrete time when testosterone concen-
trations decline abruptly.

Several epidemiologic studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study, 
the EMAS, and the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS), 
that  used  mass  spectrometry  for  measuring  testosterone  levels  have 
reported  ~10%  prevalence  of  low  testosterone  levels  in  middle-aged 
and older men; the prevalence of unequivocally low testosterone and 
sexual  symptoms  in  men  aged  40–70  years  in  the  EMAS  was  2.1% 
and  increased  with  age  from  0.1%  for  men  aged  40–49  years  of  age 
to 5.1% for those aged 70–79 years. The age-related decline in testos-
terone  should  be  distinguished  from  classical  hypogonadism  due  to 
diseases  of  the  testes,  the  pituitary,  and  the  hypothalamus.  Low  total 
and bioavailable testosterone concentrations have been associated with 
decreased appendicular skeletal muscle mass and strength, decreased 
self-reported physical function, higher visceral fat mass, insulin resis-
tance, and increased risk of coronary artery disease and mortality. An 
analysis  of  signs  and  symptoms  in  older  men  in  the  EMAS  revealed 
a  syndromic  association  of  sexual  symptoms  with  total  testosterone 
levels <320 ng/dL and free testosterone levels <64 pg/mL in community- 
dwelling older men.

A  series  of  placebo-controlled  testosterone  trials  have  provided 
important information about the efficacy of testosterone in improving 
outcomes in older men. Testosterone replacement in older men, aged 

≥65,  with  sexual  symptoms  improved  sexual  activity,  sexual  desire, 
and  erectile  function  more  than  placebo.  Testosterone  replacement 
did  not  improve  fatigue  or  cognitive  function  and  had  only  a  small 
effect on mood and mobility. Among older men with low testosterone 
and  age-associated  memory  impairment,  testosterone  replacement 
did  not  improve  memory  or  other  measures  of  cognition  relative  to 
placebo.  Testosterone  replacement  was  associated  with  significantly 
greater increase in vertebral as well as femoral volumetric bone mineral 
density and estimated bone strength relative to placebo. Testosterone 
replacement was associated with a greater increase in hemoglobin lev-
els and corrected anemia in a greater proportion of men who had unex-
plained  anemia  of  aging.  Testosterone  administration  was  associated 
with  a  significantly  greater  increase  in  coronary  artery  noncalcified 
plaque volume, as measured by coronary artery computed tomography 
angiography.  Neither  the  testosterone  trials  nor  a  randomized  trial 
of  the  effects  of  testosterone  on  atherosclerosis  progression  in  aging 
men (TEAAM trial) with low or low normal testosterone levels found 
significant  differences  between  testosterone  and  placebo  arms  in  the 
rates  of  change  in  either  the  coronary  artery  calcium  scores  or  the 
common  carotid  artery  intima-media  thickness.  Neither  of  the  trials 
was long enough or large enough to determine the effects of testoster-
one replacement therapy on prostate or major adverse cardiovascular 
events. In systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, testoster-
one therapy of healthy older men with low or low-normal testosterone 
levels was associated with greater increments in lean body mass, grip 
strength, and self-reported physical function than that associated with 
placebo. Testosterone therapy has not been shown to improve clinical 
depression,  fracture  risk,  progression  to  dementia,  progression  from 
prediabetes  to  diabetes,  or  response  to  phosphodiesterase  inhibitors 
in older men.

The long-term risks of testosterone therapy remain largely unknown. 
While  there  is  no  evidence  that  testosterone  causes  prostate  cancer, 
there is concern that testosterone therapy might cause subclinical pros-
tate cancers to grow. Testosterone therapy is associated with increased 
risk of detection of prostate events.

The data relating cardiovascular disease (CVD) and venous throm-
boembolic (VTE) risk with the use of testosterone supplementation in 
men with low testosterone levels and hypogonadal symptoms are few 
and inconclusive. The relationship between testosterone and cardiovas-
cular events in cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies has been 
inconsistent. A small number of epidemiologic studies have reported 
an inverse relationship between testosterone concentrations and com-
mon carotid artery intima-media thickness. Low testosterone level has 
been  associated  with  increased  risk  of  all-cause  mortality,  especially 
cardiovascular  mortality.  It  is  possible  that  testosterone  is  a  marker 
of  health;  older  men  with  multiple  comorbid  conditions  who  are  at 
increased risk of death may have low testosterone levels as a result of 
comorbid conditions.

Most meta-analyses have not shown a statistically significant asso-
ciation between testosterone and cardiovascular events, major adverse 
cardiovascular events, or deaths. No adequately powered randomized 
trials  have  been  conducted  to  determine  the  effects  of  testosterone 
replacement  on  major  adverse  cardiovascular  events.  Thus,  there  are 
insufficient data to establish a causal link between testosterone therapy 
and cardiovascular events.

Population screening of all older men for low testosterone levels is 
not recommended, and testing should be restricted to men who have 
symptoms  or  signs  attributable  to  androgen  deficiency.  Testosterone 
therapy is not recommended for all older men with low testosterone 
levels. In older men with significant symptoms of androgen deficiency 
who  have  unequivocally  low  testosterone  levels,  testosterone  therapy 
may be considered on an individualized basis and should be instituted 
after  careful  discussion  of  the  risks  and  benefits  (see  “Testosterone 
Replacement,” below).

Testicular  morphology,  semen  production,  and  fertility  are  main-
tained  up  to  a  very  old  age  in  men.  Although  concern  has  been 
expressed  about  age-related  increases  in  germ  cell  mutations  and 
impairment  of  DNA  repair  mechanisms,  there  is  no  clear  evidence 
that  the  frequency  of  chromosomal  aneuploidy  is  increased  in  the

3020 sperm of older men. However, the incidence of autosomal dominant 
diseases, such as achondroplasia, polyposis coli, Marfan syndrome, and 
Apert syndrome, increases in the offspring of men who are advanced 
in  age,  consistent  with  transmission  of  sporadic  missense  mutations. 
Advanced  paternal  age  may  be  associated  with  increased  rates  of  de 
novo mutations, which may contribute to an increased risk of neuro-
developmental diseases such as schizophrenia and autism. The somatic 
mutations  in  male  germ  cells  that  enhance  the  proliferation  of  germ 
cells  could  lead  to  within-testis  expansion  of  mutant  clonal  lines, 
thus favoring the propagation of germ cells carrying these pathogenic 
mutations and increasing the risk of mutations in the offspring of older 
fathers (the “selfish spermatogonial selection” hypothesis).

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Androgen Deficiency

Hypogonadism  is  often  characterized  by  decreased  sex  drive, 
reduced frequency of sexual activity, inability to maintain erections, 
reduced beard growth, loss of muscle mass, decreased testicular size, 
and  gynecomastia.  Erectile  dysfunction  and  androgen  deficiency 
are two distinct clinical disorders that can coexist in middle-aged 
and older men. Some, but not all, patients with erectile dysfunction 
have testosterone deficiency. Thus, it is useful to evaluate men pre-
senting  with  erectile  dysfunction  for  androgen  deficiency.  Except 
when extreme, these clinical features of androgen deficiency may 
be  difficult  to  distinguish  from  changes  that  occur  with  normal 
aging.  Moreover,  androgen  deficiency  may  develop  gradually. 
When  symptoms  or  clinical  features  suggest  possible  androgen 
deficiency, the laboratory evaluation is initiated by the measure-
ment of total testosterone in a fasting specimen, preferably in the 
morning using a reliable assay, such as LC-MS/MS that has been 
calibrated to an international testosterone standard (Fig. 391-7). 
A  consistently  low  total  testosterone  level  below  the  lower  limit 

of the normal male range, measured by an LC-MS/MS assay in a 
CDC-certified  laboratory,  in  association  with  symptoms,  is  evi-
dence  of  testosterone  deficiency.  An  early-morning  testosterone 
level  >400  ng/dL  makes  the  diagnosis  of  androgen  deficiency 
unlikely. In men with testosterone levels between 200 and 400 ng/
dL, the total testosterone level should be repeated, and a free testos-
terone level should be measured. In older men and in patients with 
other clinical states that are associated with alterations in SHBG lev-
els, a direct measurement of free testosterone level by equilibrium 
dialysis can be useful in unmasking testosterone deficiency.

When  androgen  deficiency  has  been  confirmed  by  the  consis-
tently  low  testosterone  concentrations,  LH  should  be  measured 
to  classify  the  patient  as  having  primary  (high  LH)  or  secondary 
(low  or  inappropriately  normal  LH)  hypogonadism.  An  elevated 
LH level indicates that the defect is at the testicular level. Common 
causes  of  primary  testicular  failure  include  Klinefelter  syndrome, 
HIV  infection,  uncorrected  cryptorchidism,  cancer  chemothera-
peutic  agents,  radiation,  surgical  orchiectomy,  or  prior  infectious 
orchitis.  Unless  causes  of  primary  testicular  failure  are  known, 
a  karyotype  should  be  performed  in  men  with  low  testosterone 
and  elevated  LH  to  diagnose  Klinefelter  syndrome.  Men  who 
have  a  low  testosterone  but  “inappropriately  normal”  or  low  LH 
levels  have  secondary  hypogonadism;  their  defect  resides  at  the 
hypothalamic-pituitary level. Common causes of acquired second-
ary  hypogonadism  include  space-occupying  lesions  of  the  sella, 
hyperprolactinemia,  chronic  illness,  hemochromatosis,  excessive 
exercise, and the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids, opiates, mar-
ijuana,  glucocorticoids,  and  alcohol.  Measurement  of  PRL  and 
MRI  scan  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary  region  can  help  exclude 
the presence of a space-occupying lesion. Patients in whom known 
causes of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have been excluded are 
classified as having IHH. It is not unusual for congenital causes of 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, such as Kallmann syndrome, to 
be diagnosed in young adults.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismTREATMENT
Androgen Deficiency

GONADOTROPINS
Gonadotropin  therapy  is  used  to  establish  or  restore  fertility  in 
patients with gonadotropin deficiency of any cause. Several gonado-
tropin preparations are available. Human menopausal gonadotropin 
(hMG; purified from the urine of postmenopausal women) contains 
75 IU FSH and 75 IU LH per vial. hCG (purified from the urine of 
pregnant  women)  has  little  FSH  activity  and  resembles  LH  in  its 
ability to stimulate testosterone production by Leydig cells. Recom-
binant  LH  is  also  available.  Treatment  is  usually  begun  with  hCG 
alone,  and  hMG  is  added  later  to  promote  the  FSH-dependent 
stages of spermatid development. Recombinant human FSH (hFSH) 
is available and is indistinguishable from purified urinary hFSH in its 
biologic activity and pharmacokinetics in vitro and in vivo, although 
the mature β subunit of recombinant hFSH has seven fewer amino 
acids. Recombinant hFSH is available in ampoules containing 75 IU 
(~7.5 μg FSH), which accounts for >99% of protein content. Once 
spermatogenesis is restored using combined FSH and LH therapy, 
hCG alone is often sufficient to maintain spermatogenesis.

Although  a  variety  of  treatment  regimens  are  used,  1000  IU  of 
hCG or recombinant human LH (rhLH) administered intramuscu-
larly three times weekly is a reasonable starting dose. Testosterone 
levels  should  be  measured  6–8  weeks  later  and  48–72  h  after  the 
hCG or rhLH injection; the hCG/rhLH dose should be adjusted to 
achieve testosterone levels in the mid-normal range. Sperm counts 
should be monitored on a monthly basis. It may take several months 
for  spermatogenesis  to  be  restored;  therefore,  it  is  important  to 
forewarn  patients  about  the  potential  length  and  expense  of  the 
treatment and to provide conservative estimates of success rates. If 
testosterone levels are in the mid-normal range but the sperm con-
centrations are low after 6 months of therapy with hCG alone, FSH 
should be added. This can be done by using hMG, highly purified 
urinary  hFSH,  or  recombinant  hFSH.  The  selection  of  FSH  dose 
is empirical. A common practice is to start with the addition of 75 
IU FSH three times each week in conjunction with the hCG/rhLH 
injections. If sperm densities are still low after 3 months of combined 
treatment, the FSH dose should be increased to 150 IU. Occasionally, 
it may take ≥18–24 months for spermatogenesis to be restored.

The two best predictors of the success of gonadotropin therapy 
in  hypogonadotropic  men  are  testicular  volume  at  presentation 
and time of onset of gonadotropin deficiency. In general, men with 
testicular volumes >8 mL have better response rates than those who 
have testicular volumes <4 mL. Patients who become hypogonad-
otropic  after  puberty  experience  higher  success  rates  than  those 
who have never undergone pubertal changes. Spermatogenesis can 
usually be reinitiated by hCG alone, with high rates of success for 
men  with  postpubertal  onset  of  hypogonadotropism.  The  pres-
ence  of  a  primary  testicular  abnormality,  such  as  cryptorchidism, 
will  attenuate  testicular  response  to  gonadotropin  therapy.  Prior 
androgen therapy does not preclude subsequent response to gonad-
otropin therapy, although some studies suggest that it may attenuate 
response to subsequent gonadotropin therapy. 

TESTOSTERONE REPLACEMENT
Androgen therapy is indicated to restore testosterone levels to nor-
mal to correct features of androgen deficiency in men with organic 
hypogonadism  due  to  known  diseases  of  the  testes,  pituitary,  and 
the hypothalamus. Testosterone replacement induces secondary sex 
characteristics; improves libido and overall sexual activity; increases 
lean muscle mass, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and bone mineral den-
sity;  and  decreases  fat  mass.  The  benefits  of  testosterone  replace-
ment therapy have only been proven in men who have documented 
symptomatic androgen deficiency, as demonstrated by testosterone 
levels that are well below the lower limit of normal.

Testosterone  is  available  in  a  variety  of  formulations  with  dis-
tinct  pharmacokinetics  (Table  391-3).  Testosterone  serves  as  a

prohormone  and  is  converted  to  17β-estradiol  by  aromatase  and 
to  5α-DHT  by  steroid  5α-reductase.  Therefore,  when  evaluating 
testosterone formulations, it is important to consider whether the 
formulation being used can achieve physiologic estradiol and DHT 
concentrations, in addition to normal testosterone concentrations. 
The current recommendation is to restore testosterone levels to the 
mid-normal range. 
Oral  Derivatives  of  Testosterone  Testosterone  is  well  absorbed 
after  oral  administration  but  is  quickly  degraded  during  the  first 
pass  through  the  liver.  Therefore,  it  is  difficult  to  achieve  sus-
tained  blood  levels  of  testosterone  after  oral  administration  of 
crystalline  testosterone.  17α-Alkylated  derivatives  of  testosterone 
(e.g.,  17α-methyl  testosterone,  oxandrolone,  fluoxymesterone)  are 
relatively resistant to hepatic degradation and can be administered 
orally; however, because of the potential for hepatotoxicity, includ-
ing  cholestatic  jaundice,  peliosis,  and  hepatoma,  these  formula-
tions should not be used for testosterone replacement. Hereditary 
angioedema due to C1 esterase deficiency is the only exception to 
this general recommendation; in this condition, oral 17α-alkylated 
androgens are useful because they stimulate hepatic synthesis of the 
C1 esterase inhibitor. 
Injectable  Forms  of  Testosterone  The  esterification  of  testoster-
one at the 17β-hydroxy position makes the molecule hydrophobic 
and extends its duration of action. The slow release of testosterone 
ester  from  an  oily  depot  in  the  muscle  accounts  for  its  extended 
duration  of  action.  The  longer  the  side  chain,  the  greater  is  the 
hydrophobicity of the ester and longer the duration of action. Thus, 
testosterone  enanthate,  cypionate,  and  undecanoate  with  longer 
side chains have longer durations of action than testosterone pro-
pionate. Within 24 h after intramuscular administration of 200 mg 
testosterone enanthate or cypionate, testosterone levels rise into the 
high-normal or supraphysiologic range and then gradually decline 
into  the  hypogonadal  range  over  the  next  2  weeks.  A  bimonthly 
regimen of testosterone enanthate or cypionate therefore results in 
peaks and troughs in testosterone levels that may be accompanied 
by  changes  in  a  patient’s  mood,  sexual  desire,  and  energy  level; 
weekly  administration  of  testosterone  enanthate  or  cypionate  can 
reduce  these  variations  in  testosterone  levels  during  the  dosing 
interval.  The  kinetics  of  testosterone  enanthate  and  cypionate  are 
similar. Estradiol and DHT levels are normal if testosterone replace-
ment is physiologic.

A  long-acting  testosterone  undecanoate  in  oil,  administered  at 
an  initial  priming  dose  of  750  mg  intramuscularly  followed  by  a 
second  dose  of  750  mg  4  weeks  later,  and  then  at  a  maintenance 
dose of 750 mg every 10 weeks, maintains serum testosterone, est-
radiol, and DHT in the normal male range and corrects symptoms 
of androgen deficiency in a majority of treated men. However, its 
relative  drawbacks  are  the  large  injection  volume  and  the  risk  of 
pulmonary  oil  microembolism  (POME)  reaction  in  a  very  small 
proportion of patients. 
Transdermal  Testosterone  Patch  The  nongenital  testosterone 
patch, when applied in an appropriate dose, can normalize testos-
terone,  DHT,  and  estradiol  levels  4–12  h  after  application.  Sexual 
function  and  well-being  are  restored  in  androgen-deficient  men 
treated  with  the  nongenital  patch.  One  4-mg  patch  may  not  be 
sufficient to increase testosterone into the mid-normal male range 
in all hypogonadal men; many patients may need two 4-mg patches 
daily to achieve the targeted testosterone concentrations. The use of 
testosterone patches may be associated with skin irritation in some 
individuals. 
Testosterone Gel  Several transdermal testosterone gels, Androgel, 
Testim,  Fortesta,  and  Axiron,  and  some  generic  versions,  when 
applied  topically  to  the  skin  in  appropriate  doses  (Table  391-3), 
can  maintain  total  and  free  testosterone  concentrations  in  the 
normal range in hypogonadal men. The current recommendations 
are  to  begin  with  an  initial  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration– 
recommended dose and adjust the dose based on testosterone levels.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismThe advantages of the testosterone gel include the ease of applica-
tion. A major concern is the potential for inadvertent transfer of the 
gel to a sexual partner or to children who may come in close contact 
with the patient. The ratio of DHT to testosterone concentrations 
is higher in men treated with the testosterone gel than in healthy 
men. Also, there is considerable intra- and interindividual variation 
in serum testosterone levels in men treated with the transdermal gel 
due to variations in transdermal absorption and plasma clearance 
of testosterone. Therefore, monitoring of serum testosterone levels 
and  multiple  dose  adjustments  may  be  required  to  achieve  and 
maintain testosterone levels in the target range. 

Buccal  Adhesive  Testosterone  A  buccal  testosterone  tablet, 
which adheres to the buccal mucosa and releases testosterone as it 
is slowly dissolved, has been approved. After twice-daily application 
of  30-mg  tablets,  serum  testosterone  levels  are  maintained  within 
the normal male range in a majority of treated hypogonadal men. 
The adverse effects include buccal ulceration and gum problems in 
a few subjects. The effects of food and brushing on absorption have 
not been studied in detail.

Pellets of crystalline testosterone can be inserted in the subcuta-
neous tissue through a small skin incision. Testosterone is released 
by  surface  erosion  of  the  implant  and  absorbed  into  the  systemic 
circulation, and testosterone levels can be maintained in the normal 
range for 3–4 months. Potential drawbacks include incising the skin 
for insertion and removal and spontaneous extrusions and fibrosis 
at the site of the implant.

Testosterone undecanoate, formulated in a self-emulsifying drug 
delivery system that includes hydrophilic and lipophilic excipients 
to enable its solubilization in the gut, is absorbed through the lym-
phatics  after  oral  ingestion  with  a  typical  meal  and  is  spared  the 
first-pass degradation in the liver. After each administration, serum 
testosterone levels rise and return to baseline by 12 h. When admin-
istered at the recommended dose, average serum testosterone levels 
are maintained in the normal range in a majority of treated men, but 
DHT-to-testosterone ratios are higher in hypogonadal men treated 
with oral testosterone undecanoate, as compared to eugonadal men.
An intranasal testosterone gel is now available as a metered-dose 
pump and is administered typically at a starting dose of 11 mg tes-
tosterone in the form of two pump actuations, one in each nostril 
three times daily. Formulation-specific adverse effects include rhin-
orrhea, nasal discomfort, epistaxis, nasopharyngitis, and nasal scab. 

Novel  Androgen  Formulations  A  number  of  androgen  for-
mulations  with  better  pharmacokinetics  or  more  selective   
activity  profiles  are  under  development.  Long-acting  biode-
gradable  microsphere  formulations  have  also  been  investigated. 
7α-Methyl-19-nortestosterone  is  an  androgen  that  cannot  be 
5α-reduced;  therefore,  compared  to  testosterone,  it  has  relatively 
greater agonist activity in muscle and gonadotropin suppression but 
lesser activity on the prostate.

Selective AR modulators (SARMs) are a class of AR ligands that 
bind the AR and display tissue-selective actions. A number of non-
steroidal SARMs that act as agonists on the muscle and bone and 
that spare the prostate to varying degrees have advanced to phase 
3 human trials. Nonsteroidal SARMs do not serve as substrates for 
either  the  steroid  5α-reductase  or  the  CYP19  (aromatase).  SARM 
binding  to  AR  induces  specific  conformational  changes  in  the 
AR  protein,  which  then  modulates  protein–protein  interactions 
between  AR  and  its  coregulators,  resulting  in  tissue-specific  reg-
ulation of gene expression. SARMs that are strong agonists for the 
muscle, bone, and sexual function and antagonists for the prostate 
may  be  valuable  in  treating  men  with  prostate  cancer  who  are 
receiving androgen deprivation therapy. 

Pharmacologic  Uses  of  Androgens  Androgens  and  SARMs  are 
being evaluated as anabolic therapies for functional limitations asso-
ciated with aging and chronic illness. Testosterone supplementation 
increases  skeletal  muscle  mass,  maximal  voluntary  strength,  and 
muscle  power  in  healthy  men,  hypogonadal  men,  older  men  with

low  testosterone  levels,  HIV-infected  men  with  weight  loss,  and 
men  receiving  glucocorticoids.  These  anabolic  effects  of  testoster-
one are related to testosterone dose and circulating concentrations. 
Systematic  reviews  have  confirmed  that  testosterone  therapy  of 
HIV-infected men with weight loss promotes improvements in body 
weight,  lean  body  mass,  muscle  strength,  and  depression  indices, 
leading to the recommendation that testosterone be considered as 
an  adjunctive  therapy  in  HIV-infected  men  who  are  experiencing 
unexplained  weight  loss  and  who  have  low  testosterone  levels. 
It  is  unknown  whether  testosterone  therapy  of  older  men  with 
functional  limitations  is  safe  and  effective  in  improving  physical 
function,  vitality,  and  health-related  quality  of  life,  and  reducing 
disability.  Concerns  about  potential  adverse  effects  of  testosterone 
on the prostate and cardiovascular event rates have encouraged the 
development  of  SARMs  that  are  preferentially  anabolic  and  spare 
the prostate.

Testosterone  administration  induces  hypertrophy  of  both  type 
1 and 2 fibers and increases satellite cell (muscle progenitor cells) 
and  myonuclear  number.  Androgens  promote  the  differentiation 
of  mesenchymal,  multipotent  progenitor  cells  into  the  myogenic 
lineage and inhibit their differentiation into the adipogenic lineage. 
Testosterone  binding  to  AR  promotes  the  association  of  liganded 
AR with β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus where it 
binds  TCF-4  and  activates  Wnt-target  genes,  including  follistatin, 
which  blocks  signaling  through  the  transforming  growth  factor  β 
pathway,  thereby  promoting  myogenic  differentiation  of  muscle 
progenitor cells. Testosterone may have additional effects on satel-
lite cell replication and polyamine pathway, which may contribute 
to an increase in skeletal muscle mass.

Other indications for androgen therapy are in selected patients 
with anemia due to bone marrow failure (an indication largely sup-
planted by erythropoietin) or for hereditary angioedema. 
Male Hormonal Contraception Based on Combined Administration 
of  Testosterone  and  Gonadotropin  Inhibitors  Supraphysiologic 
doses of testosterone (200 mg testosterone enanthate weekly) sup-
press  LH  and  FSH  secretion  and  induce  azoospermia  in  50%  of 
Caucasian men and >95% of Chinese men. The WHO-supported 
multicenter  efficacy  trials  have  demonstrated  that  suppression 
of  spermatogenesis  to  azoospermia  or  severe  oligozoospermia   
(<3 million/mL) by administration of supraphysiologic doses of tes-
tosterone enanthate to men results in highly effective contraception. 
Because of concern about long-term adverse effects of supraphys-
iologic  testosterone  doses,  regimens  that  combine  other  gonado-
tropin  inhibitors,  such  as  GnRH  antagonists  and  progestins,  with 
replacement doses of testosterone have been investigated. Regimens 
containing an androgen plus a progestin such as depo-medroxypro-
gesterone  acetate,  etonogestrel,  or  norethisterone  enanthate  have 
been highly effective in inducing azoospermia or severe oligozoo-
spermia  (sperm  density  <1  million/mL)  in  nearly  99%  of  treated 
men over a 1-year period. The combined regimens of testosterone 
plus a progestin have been associated with weight gain, acne, mood 
changes including depressed mood, libido changes, and decreased 
plasma  high-density  lipoprotein  (HDL)  cholesterol,  and  their 
long-term  safety  has  not  been  demonstrated.  One  such  trial  of  a 
combined regimen of testosterone undecanoate plus norethisterone 
enanthate was stopped early due to adverse events. SARMs, which 
are more potent inhibitors of gonadotropins than testosterone and 
spare the prostate, hold promise for their contraceptive potential. 
Recommended  Regimens  for  Androgen  Replacement  Testoster-
one esters are administered typically at doses of 70–100 mg intra-
muscularly every week or 140–200 mg every 2 weeks. Testosterone 
undecanoate is administered at an initial dose of 750 mg followed 
4  weeks  later  by  a  second  injection  of  750  mg  and  then  750  mg 
every 10 weeks. Testosterone gels are typically applied over a cov-
ered  area  of  skin  at  initial  doses  that  vary  with  the  formulation. 
Patients  should  wash  their  hands  after  gel  application  and  keep 
the  area  of  gel  application  covered  with  clothing  to  minimize  the 
risk of gel transfer to another person. One or two 4-mg nongenital

testosterone  patches  are  applied  daily  over  the  skin  of  the  back, 
thigh, or upper arm away from pressure areas. Bioadhesive buccal 
testosterone tablets at a dose of 30 mg are applied twice daily on the 
buccal mucosa. Oral testosterone undecanoate is taken twice daily 
with meals at a starting dose of 237 mg. Intranasal testosterone is 
administered as a spray in each nostril three times a day (33 mg/d). 
Evaluating Efficacy of Testosterone Replacement Therapy  Because 
a clinically useful marker of androgen action is not available, cor-
rection  of  symptoms,  induction  and  maintenance  of  secondary 
sex  characteristics,  and  restoration  of  testosterone  levels  into  the 
mid-normal  range  remain  the  goals  of  therapy.  Measurements  of 
LH and FSH are not useful in assessing the adequacy of testoster-
one replacement. Testosterone should be measured 3 months after 
initiating therapy to assess adequacy of therapy. There is substantial 
interindividual  variability  in  serum  testosterone  levels,  especially 
with  transdermal  gels,  presumably  due  to  genetic  differences  in 
testosterone  clearance  and  substantial  variation  in  transdermal 
absorption. In patients who are treated with testosterone enanthate 
or cypionate, testosterone levels should be 350–600 ng/dL 1 week 
after  the  injection.  If  testosterone  levels  are  outside  this  range, 
adjustments  should  be  made  either  in  the  dose  or  in  the  interval 
between  injections.  In  men  on  transdermal  patch,  gel,  or  buccal 
testosterone  therapy,  testosterone  levels  should  be  in  the  mid- 
normal range (400–750 ng/dL) 4–12 h after application. If testos-
terone  levels  are  outside  this  range,  the  dose  should  be  adjusted.   
Multiple dose adjustments are often necessary to achieve testoster-
one levels in the desired therapeutic range.

Restoration  of  sexual  function,  induction  and  maintenance  of 
secondary sex characteristics, well-being, and maintenance of muscle 
and bone health are important objectives of testosterone replacement 
therapy. The patient should be asked about sexual desire and activity, 
the  presence  of  early  morning  erections,  and  the  ability  to  achieve 
and  maintain  erections  adequate  for  sexual  intercourse.  The  hair 
growth in response to androgen replacement is variable and depends 
on ethnicity. Hypogonadal men with prepubertal onset of androgen 
deficiency  who  begin  testosterone  therapy  in  their  late  twenties  or 
thirties may find it difficult to adjust to their newly found sexuality 
and may benefit from counseling. If the patient has a sexual partner, 
the partner should be included in counseling because of the dramatic 
physical and sexual changes that occur with androgen treatment. 
Contraindications  for  Androgen  Administration  Testosterone 
administration is contraindicated in men with prostate or breast can-
cer (Table 391-4). Testosterone therapy should not be administered 
without further urologic evaluation to men with a palpable prostate 
nodule or induration, a prostate-specific antigen >3 ng/mL, or severe 

TABLE 391-4  Conditions in Which Testosterone Administration Is

lower  urinary  tract  symptoms  (American  Urological  Association 
lower urinary tract symptom score >19). Testosterone replacement 
should not be administered to men with baseline hematocrit ≥50%, 
severe untreated obstructive sleep apnea, or uncontrolled or poorly 
controlled  congestive  heart  failure,  or  with  myocardial  infarction, 
stroke, or acute coronary syndrome in the preceding 3 months. 

Monitoring  Potential  Adverse  Experiences  The  clinical  effec-
tiveness  and  safety  of  testosterone  replacement  therapy  should  be 
assessed 3–6 months after initiating testosterone therapy and annu-
ally thereafter (Table 391-5). Potential adverse effects include acne, 
oiliness of skin, erythrocytosis, breast tenderness and enlargement, 
leg  edema,  and  increased  risk  of  detection  of  prostate  events.  In 
addition, there may be formulation-specific adverse effects such as 
skin irritation with transdermal patch; risk of gel transfer to a sexual 
partner with testosterone gels; buccal ulceration and gum problems 
with buccal testosterone; pain and mood fluctuation with injectable 
testosterone esters; cough and injection site pain with long-acting 
testosterone undecanoate; and nasal irritation, epistaxis, and nasal 
scab with intranasal formulation. 
Hemoglobin  Levels  Administration  of  testosterone  to  andro-
gen-deficient  men  is  typically  associated  with  only  a  small  (~3%) 
increase in hemoglobin levels, due to direct effects of testosterone on 
hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow, stimulation of ery-
thropoietin, suppression of hepcidin, and increased iron availability 
for  erythropoiesis.  The  magnitude  of  hemoglobin  increase  during 
testosterone therapy is greater in older men than younger men and 
in  men  who  have  sleep  apnea,  a  significant  smoking  history,  or 
chronic obstructive lung disease or who live at high altitude. The fre-
quency of erythrocytosis is higher in hypogonadal men treated with 
injectable testosterone esters than in those treated with transdermal 
formulations, presumably due to the higher testosterone dose deliv-
ered  by  the  typical  regimens  of  testosterone  esters.  Erythrocytosis 
is the most frequent adverse event reported in testosterone trials in 
middle-aged and older men and is also the most frequent cause of 
treatment discontinuation in these trials. If hematocrit rises above 
54%,  testosterone  therapy  should  be  stopped  until  hematocrit  has 
fallen to <50%. After evaluation of the patient for hypoxia and sleep 
apnea, testosterone therapy may be reinitiated at a lower dose. 
Prostate  and  Serum  Prostate-Specific  Antigen  (PSA) 
Levels  Testosterone replacement therapy increases prostate vol-
ume to the size seen in age-matched controls but does not increase 
prostate volume beyond that expected for age. There is no evidence 
that  testosterone  therapy  causes  prostate  cancer.  However,  andro-
gen  administration  can  exacerbate  preexisting  metastatic  prostate 
cancer. Many older men harbor microscopic foci of cancer in their 
prostates. It is not known whether long-term testosterone admin-
istration will induce these microscopic foci to grow into clinically 
significant cancers.

PSA  levels  are  lower  in  testosterone-deficient  men  and  are 
restored  to  normal  after  testosterone  replacement.  There  is  con-
siderable  test-retest  variability  in  PSA  measurements.  Increments 
in  PSA  levels  after  testosterone  supplementation  in  androgen- 
deficient men are generally <0.5 ng/mL, and increments >1.0 ng/
mL  over  a  3–6-month  period  are  unusual.  The  90%  confidence 
interval for the change in PSA values in men with benign prostatic 
hypertrophy, measured 3–6 months apart, is 1.4 ng/mL. Therefore, 
the  Endocrine  Society  expert  panel  suggested  that  an  increase  in 
PSA  >1.4  ng/mL  in  any  1  year  after  starting  testosterone  therapy, 
if  confirmed,  should  lead  to  urologic  evaluation.  PSA  velocity 
criterion  can  be  used  for  patients  who  have  sequential  PSA  mea-
surements  for  >2  years;  a  change  of  >0.40  ng/mL  per  year  merits 
closer urologic follow-up. PSA level >4 ng/mL during treatment, if 
confirmed by repeat testing, requires further urologic evaluation. 
Cardiovascular  Risk  As  discussed  above,  there  is  insufficient 
evidence  to  determine  whether  testosterone  replacement  therapy 
increases the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in hypo-
gonadal  men.  In  two  randomized,  placebo-controlled  trials,  the

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismTABLE 391-5  Monitoring Men Receiving Testosterone Therapy
1.  Evaluate the patient 3–6 months after treatment initiation and then annually 
to assess whether symptoms have responded to treatment and whether the 
patient is suffering from any adverse effects.

2.  Monitor testosterone level 3–6 months after initiation of testosterone therapy:
•	 Therapy should aim to raise serum testosterone level into the mid-normal 

range.
•	 Injectable testosterone enanthate or cypionate: Measure serum 

testosterone level midway between injections. If testosterone is >600 ng/
dL (20.9 nmol/L) or <350 ng/dL (12.2 nmol/L), adjust dose or frequency.
•	 Transdermal patches: Assess testosterone level 3–12 h after application 
of the patch; adjust dose to achieve testosterone level in the mid-normal 
range.

•	 Buccal testosterone bioadhesive tablet: Assess level immediately before 

application of fresh system.

•	 Transdermal gels and solution: Assess testosterone level 2–12 h after 

patient has been on treatment for at least 2 weeks; adjust dose to achieve 
serum testosterone level in the mid-normal range.

•	 Testosterone pellets: Measure testosterone levels at the end of the dosing 
interval. Adjust the number of pellets and/or the dosing interval to achieve 
serum testosterone levels in the normal range

•	 Oral testosterone undecanoate: Measure testosterone levels 4–6 h after 

an oral dose.

•	 Injectable testosterone undecanoate: Measure serum testosterone level 
just prior to each subsequent injection and adjust the dosing interval to 
maintain serum testosterone in mid-normal range.

3.  Check hematocrit at baseline, at 3–6 months, and then annually. If hematocrit 
is >54%, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to a safe level; evaluate the 
patient for hypoxia and sleep apnea; reinitiate therapy with a reduced dose.

4.  Measure bone mineral density of lumbar spine and/or femoral neck after  

1–2 years of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men with osteoporosis or 
low trauma fracture, consistent with regional standard of care.

5.  In men aged ≥40 years with baseline PSA >0.6 ng/mL, perform digital rectal 
examination and check PSA level before initiating treatment, at 3–6 months, 
and then in accordance with guidelines for prostate cancer screening 
depending on the age and race of the patient.

6.  Obtain urologic consultation if there is:

•	 An increase in serum PSA concentration >1.4 ng/mL within any 12-month 

period of testosterone treatment, confirmed by repeating the test.

•	 A PSA level >4 ng/mL any time during treatment, confirmed by repeating the 

test.

•	 Detection of a prostatic abnormality on digital rectal examination.
•	 An AUA/IPSS prostate symptom score of >19 along with an increase in IPSS 

score of ≥5 points above baseline.

7.  Evaluate formulation-specific adverse effects at each visit:

•	 Buccal testosterone tabletsa: Inquire about alterations in taste and examine 

the gums and oral mucosa for irritation.

•	 Injectable testosterone esters (enanthate, cypionate, and undecanoate): Ask 

about fluctuations in mood or libido, and rarely cough after injections.

•	 Testosterone patches: Look for skin reaction at the application site.
•	 Testosterone gels: Advise patients to cover the application sites with a 

shirt and to wash the skin with soap and water before having skin-to-skin 
contact because testosterone gels leave a testosterone residue on the 
skin that can be transferred to a woman or child who might come in close 
contact. Serum testosterone levels are maintained when the application 
site is washed 4–6 h after application of the testosterone gel.

•	 Testosterone undecanoate injection: Observe patients for POME reaction for 

30 min after each injection.

•	 Testosterone pellets: Look for signs of infection, fibrosis, or pellet extrusion.
•	 Intranasal testosterone: Look for signs of nasal irritation or scab.

rate of progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis did not differ 
between  the  testosterone-  and  placebo-treated  men.  In  another

associated  with  greater  increase  in  noncalcified  plaque  volume  in 

the coronary arteries, assessed using CT coronary angiography. An

Androgen Abuse by Athletes and Recreational Bodybuilders  The 
illicit use of androgenic-anabolic steroids (AAS) to enhance athletic 
performance  first  surfaced  in  the  1950s  among  powerlifters  and 
spread rapidly to other sports, professional as well as high school 
athletes, and recreational bodybuilders. In the early 1980s, the use 
of  AAS  spread  beyond  the  athletic  community  into  the  general 
population, and now, as many as 3–4 million Americans—most of 
them men—have likely used these compounds. Most AAS users are 
not  athletes,  but  rather  recreational  weightlifters,  almost  all  men, 
who use these drugs to look lean and more muscular. A subset of 
AAS users suffers from muscle dysmorphia, a form of body image 
disorder  characterized  by  excessive  preoccupation  with  leanness 
and muscularity and poor functioning in social and occupational 
life.  A  secular  transformation  in  idealized  body  image  toward 
greater  muscularity  and  leanness  has  contributed  to  increasing 
prevalence of body image disorders and the use of muscle-building 
anabolic drugs in young men.

The most commonly used AAS include testosterone esters, nan-
drolone,  stanozolol,  methandienone,  and  methenolol.  AAS  users 
generally  use  large  doses  of  multiple  steroids  in  cycles,  a  practice 
known  as  stacking.  AAS  users  may  also  typically  use  other  drugs 
that are perceived to be muscle  building or performance enhanc-
ing, such as human GH; erythropoiesis-stimulating agents; insulin; 
stimulants  such  as  amphetamine,  clenbuterol,  cocaine,  ephedrine, 
and thyroxine; and drugs perceived to reduce adverse effects such 
as hCG, aromatase inhibitors, or estrogen antagonists. Recent years 
have witnessed increasing use of unapproved nonsteroidal SARMs 
and GH secretagogues purchased from internet sites.

Most  of  the  information  about  the  adverse  effects  of  AAS  has 
emerged  from  case  reports,  uncontrolled  studies,  or  clinical  trials 
that  used  replacement  doses  of  testosterone.  The  adverse  event 
data  from  clinical  trials  using  physiologic  replacement  doses  of 
testosterone have been extrapolated unjustifiably to AAS users, who 
may administer 10–100 times the replacement doses of testosterone 
over  many  years,  to  support  the  claim  that  AAS  use  is  safe  and 
manageable.  The  adverse  events  associated  with  AAS  use  may  be 
due to AAS themselves, concomitant use of other drugs, high-risk 
behaviors, and host characteristics that may render these individ-
uals more susceptible to AAS use or to other high-risk behaviors.

The high rates of premature mortality and morbidities observed 
in AAS users are alarming. One Finnish study reported 4.6 times the 
risk of death among elite powerlifters compared with age-matched 
men from the general population. The causes of death among pow-
erlifters  included  suicides,  myocardial  infarction,  and  liver  failure. 
A  retrospective  review  of  patient  records  in  Sweden  also  reported 
higher standardized mortality ratios for AAS users than for nonusers 
and increased death rates due to suicide, homicide, and accidents.

Four  categories  of  adverse  events  associated  with  AAS  abuse 
are  of  particular  concern:  cardiovascular  events,  psychiatric,  pro-
longed  suppression  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular  axis, 
and potential neurotoxicity. Numerous reports of premature cardiac 
death  among  young  AAS  users  raise  concerns  about  the  adverse 
cardiovascular  effects  of  AAS.  High  doses  of  AAS  may  induce 
proatherogenic  dyslipidemia,  accelerate  atherogenesis,  increase 
thrombosis  risk  via  effects  on  clotting  factors  and  platelets,  and 
induce  vasospasm  through  their  effects  on  vascular  nitric  oxide. 
Long-term AAS use may be associated with myocardial hypertro-
phy and fibrosis. Myocardial tissue of powerlifters using AAS has 
been  shown  to  be  infiltrated  with  fibrous  tissue  and  fat  droplets. 
Current  AAS  users  display  significantly  reduced  left  ventricu-
lar  systolic  and  diastolic  function  compared  to  previous  users 
and  nonusers.  Additionally,  studies  using  CT  angiography  have 
reported higher coronary artery plaque volume in AAS users than

in nonusers. Lifetime AAS dose is strongly associated with coronary 
atherosclerotic burden. Power athletes using AAS often have short 
QT  intervals  but  increased  QT  dispersion,  which  may  predispose 
them to ventricular arrhythmias.

Unlike replacement doses of testosterone, which are associated with 
only a small decrease in HDL cholesterol and little or no effect on total 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycer-
ide levels, supraphysiologic doses of testosterone and orally adminis-
tered 17α-alkylated, nonaromatizable AAS are associated with marked 
reductions in HDL cholesterol and increases in LDL cholesterol.

Some AAS users develop hypomanic and manic symptoms (irrita-
bility, aggressiveness, reckless behavior, and occasional psychotic symp-
toms, sometimes associated with violence) during AAS exposure, and 
depression,  sometimes  associated  with  suicidality,  during  AAS  with-
drawal. Users may also be susceptible to other forms of illicit drug use.
Long-term AAS use suppresses LH, FSH, and testosterone pro-
duction and spermatogenesis. Men who have used AAS for more 
than a few months experience marked suppression of the hypotha-
lamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis after stopping AAS that may 
be associated with sexual dysfunction, fatigue, infertility, depressed 
mood, and even suicidality. In some long-term AAS users, recov-
ery of the HPT axis may take a long time, may be incomplete, or 
may never occur. The symptoms of androgen deficiency caused by 
androgen withdrawal may cause some men to revert back to using 
AAS,  leading  to  continued  use  and  AAS  dependence.  As  many 
as  30%  of  AAS  users  develop  a  syndrome  of  AAS  dependence, 
characterized  by  long-term  AAS  use  despite  adverse  medical  and 
psychiatric effects. AAS withdrawal hypogonadism has emerged as 
an important cause of androgen deficiency, accounting for a sub-
stantial fraction of testosterone prescriptions in many men’s health 
clinics; therefore, AAS use should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis of hypogonadism in young men.

Supraphysiologic  doses  of  testosterone  may  also  impair  insulin 
sensitivity.  Orally  administered  androgens  also  have  been  associ-
ated with insulin resistance and diabetes.

AAS users are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors such 
as unsafe injection practices and have increased rates of incarcera-
tion that may render them at increased risk of HIV and hepatitis B 
and C. AAS users are more likely to report high-risk unprotected

and  peliosis  hepatis  have  been  reported  with  oral,  17α-alkylated 
AAS. AAS use may cause muscle hypertrophy without compensatory 
adaptations in tendons, ligaments, and joints, thus increasing the risk 
of  tendon  and  joint  injuries.  Upper  extremity  tendon  ruptures  are 
observed almost exclusively among weightlifters who use AAS. AAS 
use is associated with acne, baldness, and increased body hair.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Androgenic-Anabolic Steroids Use

The suspicion of AAS use should be raised by increased hemoglo-
bin and hematocrit levels, suppressed LH and FSH and testosterone 
levels, low HDL cholesterol, and low testicular volume and sperm 
density  in  a  person  who  looks  highly  muscular.  In  AAS  users 
seeking  medical  attention,  evaluation  using  the  Appearance  and 
Performance Enhancing Drug Use Schedule (APEDUS), a validated 
semi-structured  interview,  is  sufficient  to  assess  the  associated 
body image or eating disorder, psychiatric symptoms, and the use 
of AAS and other substances; formal testing for AAS usually is not 
needed. History of AAS use should be obtained in all young men 
being evaluated for hypogonadism. As AAS use is often associated 
with  the  use  of  other  substances,  a  urine  dug  screen  for  other 
substances  is  helpful  in  guiding  treatment.  If  needed,  accredited 
laboratories use gas chromatography–mass spectrometry or liquid  
chromatography–mass  spectrometry  to  detect  anabolic  steroid 
abuse.  High-resolution  mass  spectrometry  and  tandem  mass 

spectrometry  have  further  improved  the  sensitivity  of  detecting 
AAS use. Illicit testosterone use is detected generally by the mea-
surement  of  urinary  testosterone-to-epitestosterone  ratio  and  fur-
ther  confirmed  by  the  13C:12C  ratio  in  testosterone  using  isotope 
ratio  combustion  mass  spectrometry.  Exogenous  testosterone 
administration  increases  urinary  testosterone  glucuronide  excre-
tion  and  consequently  the  testosterone-to-epitestosterone  ratio. 
Ratios  >4  suggest  exogenous  testosterone  use  but  can  also  reflect 
genetic variation. Genetic variations in the uridine diphospho-glu-
curonyltransferase 2B17 (UGT2B17), the major enzyme for testos-
terone  glucuronidation,  affect  the  testosterone-to-epitestosterone 
ratio. Synthetic testosterone has a lower  13C:12C ratio than endoge-
nously produced testosterone, and these differences in 13C:12C ratio 
can  be  detected  by  isotope  ratio  combustion  mass  spectrometry, 
which is used to confirm exogenous testosterone use in individuals 
with a high testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio.

The treatment of AAS use disorder requires a multidisciplinary 
team  that  includes  an  endocrinologist  or  an  internist  to  treat  the 
AAS  withdrawal  hypogonadism  and  other  medical  problems;  a 
mental health expert to treat the substance use disorder and depres-
sive symptoms and to address suicide risk and body image disorder; 
and  sometimes  a  social  worker  for  care  coordination.  In  patients 
who are willing to stop or who have already stopped AAS use, the 
initial step is to restore the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by 
administering either clomiphene (or its enantiomer trans enclomi-
phene), a partial estrogen agonist, at an initial dose of 50 mg daily 
or  hCG  at  a  dose  of  750–1000  IU  three  times  weekly.  Some  men 
may not respond to clomiphene and may require switching to hCG. 
AAS  users  also  need  evaluation  and  treatment  of  the  underlying 
body image disorder. Mirror exposure therapy in which the patient 
stands  in  front  of  a  mirror  and  describes  his  body  appearance  to 
the  mental  health  provider  has  been  moderately  efficacious  in 
small, randomized trials. Body dysmorphia may require cognitive- 
behavioral  therapy  or  pharmacotherapy  using  selective  serotonin 
uptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.

392 Disorders of the Female 
Reproductive System
Janet E. Hall, Anuja Dokras

The  female  reproductive  system  regulates  the  hormonal  changes 
responsible  for  puberty  and  adult  reproductive  function.  Normal 
reproductive function in women requires the dynamic integration of 
hormonal signals from the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary, result-
ing in repetitive cycles of follicle development, ovulation, and prepa-
ration of the endometrial lining of the uterus for implantation should 
conception occur.

For  further  discussion  of  related  topics,  see  the  following  chapters: 
amenorrhea and pelvic pain (Chap. 393), infertility and contraception 
(Chap.  396),  menopause  (Chap.  395),  disorders  of  sex  development 
(Chap. 390), and disorders of the male reproductive system (Chap. 391).

DEVELOPMENT OF THE OVARY AND EARLY 
FOLLICULAR GROWTH
The ovary orchestrates the development and release of a mature oocyte 
and secretes hormones (e.g., estrogen, progesterone, inhibins A and B, 
relaxin) that play critical roles in a variety of target tissues, including 
breast, bone, and uterus, in addition to the hypothalamus and pituitary. 
To achieve these functions in repeated monthly cycles, the ovary under-
goes some of the most dynamic changes 
of  any  organ  in  the  body.  Primordial 
germ cells can be identified by the third 
week of gestation, and their migration to 
the genital ridge is complete by 6 weeks 
of  gestation.  Germ  cells  persist  within 
the genital ridge, are then referred to as 
oogonia,  and  are  essential  for  induction 
of ovarian development. In patients with 
45,X Turner syndrome, primordial germ 
cells proliferate and migrate to the genital 
ridge  but  do  not  persist  because  their 
survival  requires  pregranulosa  cells  that 
are dependent on the presence of both X 
chromosomes (Chap. 390).

The  germ  cell  population  expands, 
and  starting  at  ~8  weeks  of  gestation, 
oogonia  begin  to  enter  prophase  of  the 
first  meiotic  division  and  become  pri-
mary  oocytes.  This  allows  the  oocyte 
to  be  surrounded  by  a  single  layer  of 
flattened  granulosa  cells  to  form  a  pri-
mordial  follicle  (Fig.  392-1).  Granulosa 
cells are derived from mesonephric cells 
that  migrate  into  the  ovary  early  in  its 
development,  pushing  the  germ  cells 
to  the  periphery.  Although  there  is  evi-
dence  that  both  oocyte-like  cells  and

follicle-like structures can form from embryonic stem cells in culture, 
there is, as yet, no clear evidence that this occurs in vivo, and thus, the 
ovary appears to contain a nonrenewable pool of germ cells. Through 
the  combined  processes  of  mitosis,  meiosis,  and  atresia, the popula-
tion  of  oogonia  reaches  its  maximum  of  6–7  million  by  20  weeks  in 
the fetus, after which there is a progressive loss of both oogonia and 
primordial follicles through the process of atresia. It appears that entry 
into  meiosis  provides  some  degree  of  protection  from  programmed 
cell death. At birth, oogonia are no longer present in the ovary, and 
only 1–2 million germ cells remain in the form of primordial follicles 
(Fig. 392-2). The oocyte persists in prophase of the first meiotic divi-
sion until just before ovulation, when meiosis resumes.

The quiescent primordial follicles are recruited to further growth and 
differentiation  through  a  highly  regulated  process  that  limits  the  size 
of  the  developing  cohort  to  ensure  that  folliculogenesis  can  continue 
throughout the reproductive life span. This initial recruitment of pri-
mordial follicles to form primary follicles (Fig. 392-1) is characterized 
by growth of the oocyte and the transition from squamous to cuboidal 
granulosa  cells.  The  theca  interna  cells  that  surround  the  developing 
follicle  begin  to  form  as  the  primary  follicle  grows.  Acquisition  of  a 
zona pellucida by the oocyte and the presence of several layers of sur-
rounding cuboidal granulosa cells mark the development of secondary 
follicles. It is at this stage that granulosa cells develop follicle-stimulating 
hormone  (FSH),  estradiol,  and  androgen  receptors  and  communicate 
with one another through the development of gap junctions.

Bidirectional  signaling  between  the  germ  cells  and  the  somatic 
cells in the ovary is a necessary component underlying the maturation 
of  the  oocyte  and  the  capacity  for  hormone  secretion.  For  example, 
oocyte-derived growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9) and bone mor-
phogenic  protein-15  (BMP-15),  also  known  as  GDF-9b,  are  required 
for migration of pregranulosa and pretheca cells to the outer surface 
of the developing follicle and, hence, initial follicle formation. GDF-9 
is also required for formation of secondary follicles, as are granulosa 
cell–derived KIT ligand (KITL) and the forkhead transcription factor 
(FOXL2). A significant number of genes have been identified that are 
required  for  development  of  the  normal  complement  of  oogonia  in 
the  ovary,  initial  follicle  development,  and  resistance  to  follicle  loss; 
all  are  candidates  for  premature  ovarian  insufficiency  (POI),  and 
mutations  in  >50  genes  have  been  identified  in  patients  with  POI, 
with even more that have been associated with an earlier age at natural  
menopause.

DEVELOPMENT OF A MATURE FOLLICLE
The early stages of follicle growth are primarily driven by intraovarian 
factors.  Further  maturation  to  the  preovulatory  stage,  including  the 
resumption of meiosis in the oocyte, requires the combined stimulus 
of  FSH  and  luteinizing  hormone  (LH)  (Fig.  392-1).  Recruitment  of 
secondary  follicles  from  the  resting  follicle  pool  requires  the  direct 
action  of  FSH,  whereas  anti-müllerian  hormone  (AMH)  produced 
from  small  growing  follicles  (preantral)  restrains  this  effect  of  FSH, 
controlling the number of follicles entering the actively growing pool. 
Accumulation of follicular fluid between the layers of granulosa cells 
creates an antrum that divides the granulosa cells into two functionally 
distinct groups: mural cells that line the follicle wall and cumulus cells 
that surround the oocyte (Fig. 392-3). In addition to its role in normal 
development of the müllerian system, the WNT signaling pathway is 
required  for  normal  antral  follicle  development  and  may  also  play  a 
role in ovarian steroidogenesis. Recruitment to the small antral stage 
generally occurs over several cycles with further growth to follicle sizes 
of >4–7 mm in waves during a single cycle. A single dominant follicle 
emerges from the growing follicle pool within the first 5–7 days after 
the onset of menses while the majority of follicles fall off their growth 
trajectory and become atretic. Autocrine actions of activin and BMP-
6, derived from the granulosa cells, and paracrine actions of GDF-9, 
BMP-15,  BMP-6,  and  Gpr149,  derived  from  the  oocyte,  are  involved 
in granulosa cell proliferation and modulation of FSH responsiveness. 
Differential  exposure  to  these  factors,  and  to  vascular  endothelial 
growth  factor  (VEGF),  can  alter  vascular  density  and  permeability, 
likely explaining the mechanism whereby a given follicle is selected for 
continued growth to the preovulatory stage. The dominant follicle can 
be  distinguished  by  its  size,  evidence  of  granulosa  cell  proliferation,

as  a  tertiary  or  preovulatory  follicle.  (Courtesy  of  JH  Eichhorn  and  D  Roberts,

large number of FSH receptors, high aromatase activity, and elevated 
concentrations of estradiol and inhibin A in follicular fluid. In addi-
tion,  secretion  of  estradiol  and  inhibin  from  the  dominant  follicle 
inhibits FSH and the growth of other follicles.

The dominant follicle undergoes rapid expansion during the 5–6 days 
prior to ovulation, reflecting granulosa cell proliferation and accumu-
lation of follicular fluid. FSH induces LH receptors on the granulosa 
cells,  and  the  preovulatory,  or  Graafian,  follicle  moves  to  the  outer 
ovarian surface in preparation for ovulation. The LH surge triggers the 
resumption of meiosis, the suppression of granulosa cell proliferation, 
and  the  induction  of  cyclooxygenase  2  (COX-2),  prostaglandins,  the 
progesterone  receptor  (PR),  and  the  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)-
like  growth  factors  amphiregulin,  epiregulin,  betacellulin,  and  neu-
roregulin 1, all of which are required for ovulation. Ovulation requires 
production of extracellular matrix, leading to expansion of the cumulus 
cell population that surrounds the oocyte and the controlled expulsion 
of the egg and follicular fluid. Both progesterone and prostaglandins 
(induced by the ovulatory stimulus) are essential for this process, as are 
members of the matrix metalloproteinase family. After ovulation, lutei-
nization of theca and granulosa cells is induced by LH in conjunction 
with the acquisition of a rich vascular network in response to VEGF 
and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Traditional regulators of cen-
tral  reproductive  control,  gonadotropin-releasing  hormone  (GnRH) 
and its receptor (GnRHR), as well as kisspeptin, are also produced in 
the ovary and may be involved in corpus luteum function.

REGULATION OF OVARIAN FUNCTION
 ■ HYPOTHALAMIC AND PITUITARY SECRETION
GnRH neurons derive from cells in the olfactory placode and, to a lesser 
extent, the neural crest. They migrate along the scaffold of the olfac-
tory  neurons  across  the  cribriform  plate  to  the  hypothalamus  where 
they separate from the olfactory neurons. Studies in GnRH-deficient 
patients who fail to undergo puberty have provided insights into genes 
that control the ontogeny and function of GnRH neurons (Fig. 392-4). 
KAL1,  FGF8/FGFR1,  PROK2/PROKR2,  NSMF,  HS6SD1,  and  CDH7, 
among others (Chap. 391), have been implicated in the migration of 
GnRH neurons to the hypothalamus while KISS, TAC3, Dyn and their 
receptors are involved in the upstream regulation of GnRH secretion. 
Approximately 7000 GnRH neurons, scattered throughout the medial 
basal hypothalamus, establish contacts with capillaries of the pituitary 
portal system in the median eminence. GnRH is secreted into the pitu-
itary portal system in discrete pulses to stimulate synthesis and secre-
tion of LH and FSH from pituitary gonadotropes, which comprise ~10% 
of cells in the pituitary (Chap. 378). Functional connections of GnRH 
neurons with the portal system are established by the end of the first 
trimester,  coinciding  with  the  production  of  pituitary  gonadotropins. 
Thus, like the ovary, the hypothalamic and pituitary components of the 
reproductive system are present before birth. However, the high levels of 
estradiol and progesterone produced by the placenta suppress hypotha-
lamic-pituitary stimulation of ovarian hormonal secretion in the fetus.

After birth and the loss of placenta-derived steroids, gonadotropin 
levels rise. FSH levels are much higher in girls than in boys. This rise 
in  FSH  results  in  circulating  estradiol  and  increased  inhibin  B,  but 
without  terminal  follicle  maturation  or  ovulation.  Studies  that  have 
identified  mutations  in  TAC3,  which  encodes  neurokinin  B,  and  its 
receptor, TAC3R, in patients with GnRH deficiency indicate that both 
are  involved  in  control  of  GnRH  secretion  and  may  be  particularly 
important at this early stage of development. By 12–20 months of age, 
the reproductive axis is again suppressed, and a period of relative qui-
escence persists until puberty (Fig. 392-5). At the onset of puberty, 
pulsatile GnRH secretion induces pituitary gonadotropin production. 
In the early stages of puberty, LH and FSH secretion are apparent only 
during sleep, but as puberty develops, pulsatile LH secretion occurs 
throughout the day and night.

The  mechanisms  responsible  for  the  childhood  quiescence  and 
pubertal  reactivation  of  the  reproductive  axis  remain  incompletely 
understood.  GnRH  neurons  in  the  hypothalamus  respond  to  both 
excitatory and inhibitory factors. Increased sensitivity to the inhibitory

influence of gonadal steroids has long been implicated in the inhibi-
tion of GnRH secretion during childhood but has not been definitively 
established in the human. Metabolic signals, including adipocyte-de-
rived  leptin,  play  a  permissive  role  in  reproductive  function  (Chap. 
401).  Studies  of  patients  with  isolated  GnRH  deficiency  reveal  that 
mutations in the G protein–coupled receptor 54 (GPR54) gene (now 
known as KISS1R) preclude the onset of puberty. The ligand for this 
receptor  is  derived  from  the  parent  peptide,  kisspeptin-1  (KISS1), 
and  is  a  powerful  stimulant  for  GnRH  release.  A  potential  role  for 
kisspeptin in the onset of puberty has been suggested by upregulation 
of  KISS1  and  KISS1R  transcripts  in  the  hypothalamus  at  the  time  of 
puberty. TAC3, which stimulates GnRH secretion through kisspeptin 
signaling,  and  dynorphin  (Dyn),  which  plays  an  inhibitory  role  in 
GnRH control, are frequently co-expressed with KISS1 in KNDY neu-
rons of the median eminence that project to GnRH neurons. This sys-
tem is intimately involved in both estrogen and progesterone negative 
feedback regulation of GnRH secretion.

RFamide-related peptides (RFRPs) are the mammalian orthologues 
of gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH), which was initially dis-
covered in the quail. While RFRP-1 and RFRP-3 neurons send axonal 
projections to GnRH neurons in humans and RFRPs are secreted into 
the pituitary portal system, further studies are required to determine 
their potential physiologic role in the human.

 ■ OVARIAN STEROIDS
Ovarian  steroid-producing  cells  do  not  store  hormones  but  produce 
them in response to FSH and LH during the normal menstrual cycle. 
The  sequence  of  steps  and  the  enzymes  involved  in  the  synthesis  of 
steroid hormones are similar in the ovary, adrenal, and testis. However, 
the enzymes required to catalyze specific steps are compartmentalized 
and may not be abundant or even present in all cell types. Within the 
developing ovarian follicle, estrogen synthesis from cholesterol requires 
close integration between theca and granulosa cells—sometimes called 
the  two-cell  model  for  steroidogenesis  (Fig.  392-6).  FSH  receptors  are 
confined  to  the  granulosa  cells,  whereas  LH  receptors  are  restricted 
to the theca cells until the late stages of follicular development, when 
they are also found on granulosa cells. The theca cells surrounding the 
follicle are highly vascularized and use cholesterol, derived primarily 
from  circulating  lipoproteins,  as  the  starting  point  for  the  synthesis 
of  androstenedione  and  testosterone  under  the  control  of  LH.  These 
steroid precursors cross the basal lamina to the granulosa cells, which 
receive  no  direct  blood  supply.  The  mural  granulosa  cells  are  par-
ticularly  rich  in  aromatase  and,  under  the  control  of  FSH,  produce 
estradiol, the primary steroid secreted from the follicular phase ovary 
and  the most  potent estrogen. Theca  cell–produced androstenedione 
and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  testosterone  are  also  secreted  into  peripheral 
blood, where they can be converted to dihydrotestosterone in skin and 
to estrogens in adipose tissue. The hilar interstitial cells of the ovary 
are functionally similar to Leydig cells and are also capable of secreting 
androgens.  Stromal  cells  proliferate  in  response  to  androgens  (as  in 
polycystic  ovary  syndrome  [PCOS])  but  do  not  secrete  androgens. 
However, high levels of androgens may be produced by luteinized theca 
cells in women with hyperthecosis.

Development of the rich capillary network following rupture of the 
follicle at the time of ovulation makes it possible for large molecules 
such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to reach the luteinized granulosa 
and theca lutein cells. As in the follicle, both cell types are required for 
steroidogenesis  in  the  corpus  luteum.  The  luteinized  granulosa  cells 
are the main source of progesterone production, whereas the smaller 
theca  lutein  cells  produce  17-hydroxyprogesterone  and  androgenic 
substrates  for  aromatization  to  estradiol  by  the  luteinized  granulosa 
cells.  Production  of  estrogen  metabolites  by  the  corpus  luteum  plays 
a  significant  role  in  maintenance  of  the  vascularization  required  for 
its  function.  LH  is  critical  for  formation  and  maintenance  of  corpus 
luteum  structure  and  function.  LH  and  human  chorionic  gonado-
tropin (hCG) bind to a common receptor; thus, in conception cycles, 
hCG produced upon fertilization rescues the declining function of the

3030 corpus  luteum,  maintaining  steroid  and  peptide  secretion  for  the 
first  10  weeks of pregnancy. hCG is commonly used for luteal phase 
support in the treatment of infertility.

Steroid Hormone Actions  Both estrogen and progesterone play 
critical  roles  in  the  expression  of  secondary  sexual  characteristics  in 
women  (Chap.  377).  Estrogen  promotes  development  of  the  ductule 
system in the breast, whereas progesterone is responsible for glandular 
development.  In  the  reproductive  tract,  estrogens  create  a  receptive 
environment  for  fertilization  and  support  pregnancy  and  parturition 
through carefully coordinated changes in the endometrium, thicken-
ing of the vaginal mucosa, thinning of the cervical mucus, and uterine 
growth  and  contractions.  Progesterone  induces  secretory  activity  in 
the estrogen-primed endometrium, increases the viscosity of cervical 
mucus,  and  inhibits  uterine  contractions.  Both  gonadal  steroids  play 
critical roles in negative and positive feedback of gonadotropin secre-
tion. Progesterone also increases basal body temperature, which is used 
clinically as a marker of ovulation.

The  vast  majority  of  circulating  estrogens  and  androgens  are  car-
ried in the blood bound to carrier proteins, which restrain their free 
diffusion into cells and prolong their clearance, serving as a reservoir. 
High-affinity binding proteins include sex hormone–binding globulin 
(SHBG), which binds androgens with somewhat greater affinity than 
estrogens,  and  corticosteroid-binding  globulin  (CBG),  which  also 
binds progesterone. Modulations in binding protein levels by insulin, 
androgens, and estrogens contribute to high bioavailable testosterone 
levels in PCOS and to high circulating total estrogen and progesterone 
levels during pregnancy.

Estrogens  act  primarily  through  binding  to  the  nuclear  receptors, 
estrogen  receptor  (ER)  α  and  β.  Transcriptional  coactivators  and 
co-repressors modulate ER action (Chap. 377). Both ER subtypes are 
present  in  the  hypothalamus,  pituitary,  ovary,  and  reproductive  tract. 
Although ERα and β exhibit some functional redundancy, there is also 
a high degree of specificity, particularly in expression within cell types. 
For example, ERα functions in ovarian theca cells, whereas ERβ is critical 
for granulosa cell function. There is also evidence for membrane-initiated 
signaling by estrogen. Similar signaling mechanisms pertain for proges-
terone with evidence of transcriptional regulation through PR A and B 
protein isoforms, as well as rapid membrane signaling.

 ■ OVARIAN PEPTIDES
Inhibin  was  initially  isolated  from  gonadal  fluids  based  on  its  ability 
to  selectively  inhibit  FSH  secretion  from  pituitary  cells.  Inhibin  is  a 
heterodimer composed of an α subunit and a βA or βB subunit to form 
inhibin  A  or  inhibin  B,  both  of  which  are  secreted  from  the  ovary. 
Activin  is  a  homodimer  of  inhibin  β  subunits  with  the  capacity  to 
stimulate the synthesis and secretion of FSH. Inhibins and activins are 
members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily of 
growth and differentiation factors. During the purification of inhibin, 
follistatin, an unrelated monomeric protein that inhibits FSH secretion, 
was discovered. Within the pituitary, follistatin inhibits FSH secretion 
indirectly by binding and neutralizing activin.

Inhibin  B  is  constitutively  secreted  from  the  granulosa  cells  of 
small antral follicles, and its serum levels increase in conjunction with 
granulosa  cell  proliferation  during  recruitment  of  secondary  follicles 
under the control of FSH. Inhibin B is an important inhibitor of FSH, 
independent of estradiol, during the menstrual cycle. Inhibin A is pres-
ent in both granulosa and theca cells and is secreted by the dominant 
follicle. Inhibin A is also present in luteinized granulosa cells and is a 
major secretory product of the corpus luteum. Synthesis and secretion 
of inhibin A are directly controlled by FSH and LH. Although activin is 
also secreted from the ovary, the excess of follistatin in serum, combined 
with its nearly irreversible binding of activin, make it unlikely that ovar-
ian activin plays an endocrine role in FSH regulation. However, there 
is evidence that activin plays an autocrine/paracrine role in the ovary, 
in addition to its intrapituitary role in modulation of FSH production.

AMH (also known as müllerian-inhibiting substance) is important 
in ovarian biology in addition to the function from which it derived 
its name (i.e., promotion of the degeneration of the müllerian system 

during  embryogenesis  in  the  male).  AMH  is  produced  by  granulosa 
cells from small preantral and early antral follicles and is a marker of 
ovarian reserve with advantages over inhibin B because of its relative 
stability across the menstrual cycle. AMH inhibits the recruitment of 
primordial follicles into the follicle pool and counters FSH stimulation 
of aromatase expression. AMH levels are highest in the early twenties 
and decrease markedly by menopause. AMH is increased in PCOS in 
conjunction with the abundance of small follicles in this disorder.

Gonadotropin surge attenuating factor (GnSAF) is an ovarian fac-
tor  that  attenuates  GnRH-induced  gonadotropin  secretion.  Its  role  is 
not yet fully understood, but there is an inverse relationship between 
GnSAF and follicle size, suggesting that its primary role involves the 
early stages of follicle development rather than curtailing the gonado-
tropin surge as its name implies.

Relaxin is produced primarily by the theca lutein cells of the corpus 
luteum.  Both  relaxin  and  its  receptor,  RXFP1,  are  highly  expressed 
in  the  uterus  during  the  peri-implantation  period  in  the  marmoset, 
and  its  primary  role  appears  to  be  in  promoting  decidualization  and 
vascularization of the endometrium prior to implantation. Relaxin was 
named for its ability to suppress myometrial contractility in pigs and 
rodents, but it does not appear to exert this activity in women.

HORMONAL INTEGRATION OF THE 
NORMAL MENSTRUAL CYCLE
The sequence of changes responsible for mature reproductive function 
is coordinated through a series of negative and positive feedback loops 
that  alter  pulsatile  GnRH  secretion,  the  pituitary  response  to  GnRH, 
and the relative secretion of LH and FSH from the gonadotrope. The 
frequency  and  amplitude  of  pulsatile  GnRH  secretion  differentially 
modulate  the  synthesis  and  secretion  of  LH  and  FSH.  Slow  GnRH 
pulse frequencies favor FSH synthesis, whereas increased GnRH pulse 
frequency  and  amplitude  favor  LH  synthesis.  Activin  is  produced  in 
both  pituitary  gonadotropes  and  folliculostellate  cells  and  stimulates 
the synthesis and secretion of FSH through autocrine-paracrine mech-
anisms  that  are  modulated  by  follistatin.  Inhibins  function  as  potent 
antagonists of activins through sequestration of the activin receptors. 
Although inhibin is expressed in the pituitary, gonadal inhibin is the 
principal source of feedback inhibition of FSH.

For the majority of the cycle, the reproductive system functions in a 
classic endocrine negative feedback mode. Estradiol and progesterone 
inhibit  GnRH  secretion,  acting  through  kisspeptin  and  dynorphin  in 
the KNDy neurons, while the inhibins act at the pituitary to selectively 
inhibit FSH synthesis and secretion (Fig. 392-7). Estradiol also contrib-
utes to negative feedback at the pituitary with an effect that is greater 
for  FSH  than  LH.  This  tightly  regulated  negative  feedback  control  of 
FSH is critical for development of the single mature oocyte that char-
acterizes normal reproductive function in women. In addition to these 
negative feedback controls, the menstrual cycle is uniquely dependent 
on estrogen-induced positive feedback to produce an LH surge that is 
essential for ovulation of a mature follicle. Estrogen negative feedback 
in women occurs primarily at the hypothalamus with a small pituitary 
contribution, whereas estrogen positive feedback occurs at the pituitary 
in women with upregulation of GnRH signaling and responsiveness. In 
women, hypothalamic GnRH secretion plays a permissive role in gen-
erating the preovulatory gonadotropin surge, a mechanism that differs 
significantly from that in rodents and other species that rely on seasonal 
and circadian cues, in which a surge of GnRH also occurs.
 ■ THE FOLLICULAR PHASE
The follicular phase is characterized by recruitment of a cohort of second-
ary follicles and the ultimate selection of a dominant preovulatory follicle 
(Fig. 392-8). The follicular phase begins, by convention, on the first day 
of menses. However, follicle recruitment is initiated by the rise in FSH that 
begins in the late luteal phase of the previous cycle in conjunction with 
the loss of negative feedback of gonadal steroids and likely inhibin A. The 
fact that a 20–30% increase in FSH is adequate for follicular recruitment 
speaks to the marked sensitivity of the resting follicle pool to FSH. The 
resultant  granulosa  cell  proliferation  is  responsible  for  increasing  early 
follicular phase levels of inhibin B. Inhibin B, in conjunction with rising

levels  of  estradiol  and  inhibin  A,  restrains  FSH  secretion  during  this 
critical period such that only a single follicle matures in the vast majority 
of cycles. The increased risk of  multiple  gestation  associated  with  the 
increased levels of FSH characteristic of advanced maternal age or with 
exogenous  gonadotropin  administration  in  the  treatment  of  infertility 
attests to the importance of negative feedback regulation of FSH. With 
further growth of the dominant follicle, estradiol and inhibin A increase 
and the follicle acquires LH receptors. Increasing levels of estradiol are 
responsible for proliferative changes in the endometrium. The exponen-
tial rise in estradiol results in positive feedback on the pituitary, leading to 
the generation of an LH surge (and a smaller FSH surge), thereby trigger-
ing ovulation and luteinization of granulosa and theca cells.
 ■ THE LUTEAL PHASE
The  luteal  phase  begins  with  the  formation  of  the  corpus  luteum 
from  the  ruptured  follicle  (Fig.  392-8).  Progesterone  and  inhibin  A 
are  produced  from  the  luteinized  granulosa  cells,  which  continue  to 
aromatize  theca-derived  androgen  precursors,  producing  estradiol. 
The  combined  actions  of  estrogen  and  progesterone  are  responsible 
for  the  secretory  changes  in  the  endometrium  that  are  necessary  for 
implantation. The corpus luteum is supported by LH but has a finite 
life  span  because  of  diminished  sensitivity  to  LH.  The  demise  of  the 
corpus luteum results in a progressive decline in hormonal support of 
the endometrium. Inflammation or local hypoxia and ischemia result 
in  vascular  changes  in  the  endometrium,  leading  to  the  release  of 
cytokines, cell death, and shedding of the endometrium.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF OVARIAN 
FUNCTION
Menstrual bleeding should become regular within 2–4 years of menar-
che, although anovulatory and irregular cycles are common before that. 
For the remainder of adult reproductive life, the cycle length counted 
from the first day of menses to the day preceding subsequent menses is 
~28 days, with a range of 25–35 days. However, cycle-to-cycle variabil-
ity for an individual woman is ±2 days. Luteal phase length is relatively 
constant  between  12  and  14  days  in  normal  cycles;  thus,  the  major 
variability in cycle length is due to variations in follicular phase length. 
The duration of menstrual bleeding in ovulatory cycles varies between 
4  and  6  days.  There  is  a  gradual  shortening  of  cycle  length  with  age 
such  that  women  aged  >35  years  have  cycles  that  are  shorter  than 
during their younger reproductive years. Anovulatory cycles increase 
as women approach menopause, and bleeding patterns may be erratic.
Women who report regular monthly bleeding generally have ovu-
latory  cycles,  but  several  other  clinical  signs  can  be  used  to  assess 
the  likelihood  of  ovulation.  Some  women  experience  mittelschmerz, 
described as midcycle pelvic discomfort that is thought to be caused 
by the rapid expansion of the dominant follicle at the time of ovula-
tion.  A  constellation  of  premenstrual  moliminal  symptoms  such  as 
bloating,  breast  tenderness,  mood  changes,  and  food  cravings  often 
occur several days before menses in ovulatory cycles, but their absence 
cannot be used as evidence of anovulation. Methods that can be used 
to determine whether ovulation occurred include a serum progester-
one level >3 ng/mL ~7 days after ovulation, an increase in basal body 
temperature of 0.24°C (>0.5°F) in the second half of the cycle due to 
the thermoregulatory effect of progesterone, or detection of the urinary 
LH surge using ovulation predictor kits. Because ovulation occurs ~36 h 
after the LH surge, urinary LH can be helpful in timing intercourse to 
coincide with ovulation.

Ultrasound  can  be  used  to  detect  the  growth  of  the  fluid-filled 
antrum of the developing follicle and to assess endometrial thickness 
in response to increasing estradiol levels in the follicular phase. It can 
also be used to provide evidence of ovulation by documenting collapse 
of the dominant follicle and/or the presence of a corpus luteum as well 
as the characteristic echogenicity of the secretory endometrium of the 
luteal phase.

PUBERTY
 ■ NORMAL PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT IN GIRLS
The  first  menstrual  period  (menarche)  occurs  relatively  late  in  the 
series of developmental milestones that characterize normal pubertal 
development (Table 392-1). Menarche is preceded by the appearance 
of pubic and then axillary hair (adrenarche) as a result of maturation of 
the zona reticularis in the adrenal gland and increased adrenal andro-
gen secretion, particularly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The trig-
gers for adrenarche remain unknown but may involve increases in body 
mass index, as well as in utero and neonatal factors. Menarche  is  also 
preceded  by  breast  development  (thelarche).  The  breast  is  exquisitely 
sensitive to the very low levels of estrogen that result from peripheral 
conversion of adrenal androgens and the low levels of estrogen secreted

3032 from the ovary early in pubertal maturation. This estrogen sensitivity 
also explains why infants occasionally develop breast tissue in response 
to  exogenous  or  environmental  estrogens.  Breast  development  pre-
cedes  the  appearance  of  pubic  and  axillary  hair  in  ~60%  of  girls.  
The  interval  between  the  onset  of  breast  development  and  menarche  is  
~2 years. There has been a gradual decline in the age of menarche over 
the past century, attributed in large part to improvement in nutrition, 
and there is a relationship between adiposity and earlier sexual matu-
ration in girls. In the United States, menarche occurs at an average age 
of 12.5 years (Table 392-1).

Much  of  the  variation  in  the  timing  of  puberty  is  due  to  genetic 
factors. Heritability estimates from twin studies range between 50 and 
80%.  Adrenarche  and  thelarche  occur  ~1  year  earlier  in  black  girls 
compared  with  white  girls,  although  the  difference  in  the  timing  of 
menarche  is  less  pronounced.  Genome-wide  association  studies  have 
identified over a hundred genes associated with pubertal timing in boys 
and girls attesting to the high degree of coordination of this reproductive 
and growth milestone. These findings include genes involved in GnRH 
secretion (e.g., TACR3, and the maternally imprinted gene, MKRN3, that 
has been associated with familial precocious puberty), pituitary develop-
ment  and  function  (e.g.,  POU1F1),  hormone  synthesis  and  bioactivity 
(e.g., STARD4, ESR1, RXRG), gonadal feedback (e.g., INHBA, ESR1), and 
energy  homeostasis  and  growth,  including  LIN28B,  a  sentinel  puberty 
gene, which is a potent regulator of microRNA processing.

Other important hormonal changes also occur in conjunction with 
puberty. Growth hormone (GH) levels increase early in puberty, stimu-
lated in part by the pubertal increase in estrogen secretion. GH increases 
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which enhances linear growth. The 
growth spurt is generally less pronounced in girls than in boys, with a 
peak growth velocity of ~7 cm/year. Linear growth is ultimately limited 
by closure of epiphyses in the long bones as a result of prolonged expo-
sure to estrogen. Puberty is also associated with mild insulin resistance.

 ■ DISORDERS OF PUBERTY
The differential diagnosis of precocious and delayed puberty is similar 
in  boys  (Chap.  391)  and  girls.  However,  there  are  differences  in  the 
timing of normal puberty and differences in the relative frequency of 
specific disorders in girls compared with boys.

Precocious  Puberty  Traditionally,  precocious  puberty  has  been 
defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before 
the age of 8 in girls based on data from Marshall and Tanner in British 
girls studied in the 1960s. More recent studies led to recommendations 
that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or 
pubic hair is present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for 
black girls; however, these guidelines have not been widely accepted in 
favor of careful follow-up in girls presenting at <8 years.

Precocious  puberty  in  girls  is  most  often  centrally  mediated 
(Table 392-2), resulting from early activation of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-ovarian  axis.  It  is  characterized  by  pulsatile  LH  secretion 
(which is initially associated with deep sleep) and an enhanced LH and 
FSH response to exogenous GnRH or a GnRH agonist (two- to threefold 
stimulation) (Table 392-3). True precocity is marked by advancement 
in bone age of >2 standard deviations, a recent history of growth accel-
eration,  and  progression  of  secondary  sexual  characteristics.  In  girls, 
centrally mediated precocious puberty (CPP) is idiopathic in ~85% of 
cases; however, neurogenic causes must be considered. Activating muta-
tions in KISS, KISS1, and KISS1R have been found in a small number of 
patients with CPP, and loss-of-function mutations in MKRN3 have been 
reported in familial CPP. However, the frequency of these mutations is 
insufficient to justify their use in routine clinical testing. GnRH agonists 
that  induce  pituitary  desensitization  are  the  mainstay  of  treatment  to 
prevent premature epiphyseal closure and preserve adult height, as well 
as to manage psychosocial repercussions of precocious puberty.

Peripherally  mediated  precocious  puberty  does  not  involve  activa-
tion of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and is characterized by 
suppressed gonadotropins in the presence of elevated estradiol. Manage-
ment of peripheral precocious puberty involves treating the underlying 
disorder (Table 392-2) and limiting the effects of gonadal steroids using

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismIncomplete and intermittent forms of precocious puberty may also 
occur. For example, premature breast development may occur in girls 
before  the  age  of  2  years,  with  no  further  progression  and  without 
significant advancement in bone age, estrogen production, or compro-
mised height. Premature adrenarche can also occur in the absence of 
progressive pubertal development, but it must be distinguished from 
late-onset  congenital  adrenal  hyperplasia  and  androgen-secreting 
tumors, in which case it may be termed heterosexual precocity. Prema-
ture adrenarche may be associated with obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and 
the subsequent predisposition to PCOS.

Delayed Puberty  Delayed puberty (Table 392-4) is defined as the 
absence of secondary sexual characteristics by age 13 in girls. The diag-
nostic considerations are very similar to those for primary amenorrhea 
(Chap. 393). Between 25 and 40% of delayed puberty in girls is of ovar-
ian origin, with Turner syndrome accounting for the majority of such

patients. Delayed puberty may occur in the setting of systemic illnesses, 
including  celiac  disease  and  chronic  renal  disease,  and  endocrinopa-
thies such as diabetes and hypothyroidism. In addition, girls appear to 
be  particularly  susceptible  to  the  adverse  effects  of  decreased  energy 
balance resulting from exercise, dieting, and/or eating disorders, and 
thus,  functional  hypothalamic  amenorrhea  (HA)  can  present  with 
primary  amenorrhea.  Together,  these  reversible  conditions  account 
for ~25% of delayed puberty in girls. Congenital hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism in girls or boys can be caused by mutations in several 
different  genes  or  combinations  of  genes  (Fig.  392-4,  Chap.  391, 
Table 392-2). Approximately 50% of girls with congenital hypogonado-
tropic hypogonadism, with or without anosmia, have a history of some 
degree of breast development, and 10% report one to two episodes of 
vaginal bleeding. Family studies suggest that genes identified in associ-
ation with absent puberty may also cause delayed puberty, and recent 
reports have further suggested that a genetic susceptibility to environ-
mental stresses such as diet and exercise may account for at least some 
cases  of  functional  HA,  including  in  girls  who  present  with  primary 
amenorrhea.  Although  neuroanatomic  causes  of  delayed  puberty  are 
considerably less common in girls than in boys, it is always important 
to rule these out in the setting of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

Menstrual dysfunction can signal an underlying abnormality that may 
have long-term health consequences. Although frequent or prolonged 
bleeding  usually  prompts  a  woman  to  seek  medical  attention,  infre-
quent or absent bleeding may seem less troubling, and the patient may 
not bring it to the attention of the physician. Thus, a focused menstrual 
history is a critical part of every encounter with a female patient. Pel-
vic pain is a common complaint that may relate to an abnormality of 
the  reproductive  organs  but  also  may  be  of  gastrointestinal,  urinary

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Pregnancy  is  the  most  common  cause  of  amenorrhea  and  must  be 
excluded in all cases, regardless of patient history. Evaluation of men-
strual  dysfunction  depends  on  understanding  the  interrelationships 
between the four critical components of the reproductive tract: (1) the 
hypothalamus, (2) the pituitary, (3) the ovaries, and (4) the uterus and 
outflow  tract  (Fig.  393-1;  Chap.  392).  This  system  is  maintained  by 
complex  negative  and  positive  feedback  loops  involving  the  ovarian 
steroids  (estradiol  and  progesterone)  and  peptides  (inhibin  B  and 
inhibin  A)  and  the  hypothalamic  (gonadotropin-releasing  hormone 
[GnRH])  and  pituitary  (follicle-stimulating  hormone  [FSH]  and 
luteinizing hormone [LH]) components of this system (Fig. 393-1).

Disorders  of  menstrual  function  can  be  thought  of  in  two  main 
categories: disorders of the uterus and outflow tract and disorders of 
ovulation. Many of the conditions that cause primary amenorrhea are 
congenital but go unrecognized until the time of normal puberty (e.g., 
genetic, chromosomal, and anatomic abnormalities). All causes of sec-
ondary amenorrhea also can cause primary amenorrhea.

Disorders  of  the  Uterus  or  Outflow  Tract  Abnormalities 
of  the  uterus  and  outflow  tract  typically  present  as  primary  amen-
orrhea.  In  patients  with  normal  pubertal  development  and  a  blind 
vagina,  the  differential  diagnosis  includes  obstruction  by  a  trans-
verse  vaginal  septum  or  imperforate  hymen;  müllerian  agenesis 
(Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser  syndrome),  which  can  be  caused 
by mutations in the WNT4 gene, and androgen insensitivity syndrome 
(AIS), which is an X-linked recessive disorder that accounts for ~10% 
of  all  cases  of  primary  amenorrhea  (Chap.  391).  Patients  with  AIS 
have a 46,XY karyotype, but because of the lack of androgen receptor 
responsiveness,  those  with  complete  AIS  lack  features  of  androgeni-
zation  and  have  female  external  genitalia.  The  absence  of  pubic  and 
axillary hair distinguishes them clinically from patients with müllerian 
agenesis, as does a testosterone level in the male range. The rare patient 
with 5α reductase type 2 enzyme deficiency has a similar presentation 
but undergoes virilization at the time of puberty. Asherman’s syndrome

may  require  urgent  surgical  attention.  Recent  guidelines  no  longer 
recommend routine pelvic examination in asymptomatic, average-risk 
women other than periodic cervical cancer screening. However, pelvic 
examination  is  an  important  part  of  the  evaluation  of  amenorrhea, 
abnormal uterine bleeding, and pelvic pain.

MENSTRUAL DISORDERS
 ■ DEFINITION AND PREVALENCE
Amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstrual periods. Amenorrhea 
is classified as primary if menstrual bleeding has never occurred in the 
absence of hormonal treatment or secondary if menstrual periods cease 
for 3–6 months. Primary amenorrhea is a rare disorder that occurs in 
<1% of the female population. However, between 3 and 5% of women 
experience at least 3 months of secondary amenorrhea in any specific 
year. There is no evidence that race or ethnicity influences the preva-
lence of amenorrhea. However, because of the importance of adequate 
nutrition for normal reproductive function, both the age at menarche 
and the prevalence of secondary amenorrhea vary significantly in dif-
ferent parts of the world.

Oligomenorrhea is defined as a cycle length >35 days or <10 menses 
per year. Both the frequency and the amount of vaginal bleeding are 
irregular in oligomenorrhea, and moliminal symptoms (premenstrual 
breast  tenderness,  food  cravings,  mood  lability),  suggestive  of  ovu-
lation,  are  variably  present.  Anovulation  can  also  present  with  inter-
menstrual intervals <24 days. Frequent or heavy irregular bleeding is 
termed dysfunctional uterine bleeding if anatomic uterine and outflow 
tract  lesions  or  a  bleeding  diathesis  have  been  excluded.  Oligo-  and 
anovulation  are  most  frequently  associated  with  polycystic  ovarian 
syndrome (PCOS).

Primary  Amenorrhea  The  absence  of  menarche  (the  first  men-
strual period) by age 16 has been used traditionally to define primary 
amenorrhea. However, other factors, such as growth, secondary sexual 
characteristics,  and  the  presence  of  cyclic  pelvic  pain,  also  influence 
the age at which primary amenorrhea should be 
investigated. Recent studies suggest that puberty 
is  occurring  at  an  earlier  age,  particularly  in 
obese girls. However, it is important to note that 
these  data  reflect  earlier  breast  development 
alone with minimal change in the age of menar-
che. Thus, an evaluation for amenorrhea should 
be  initiated  by  age  15  or  16  in  the  presence  of 
normal growth and secondary sexual character-
istics; age 13 in the absence of secondary sexual 
characteristics or if height is less than the third 
percentile; age 12 or 13 in the presence of breast 
development and cyclic pelvic pain; or within 2 
years of breast development if menarche has not 
occurred.

Secondary  Amenorrhea  or  Oligomenor-
rhea 
Irregular  cycles  are  relatively  common 
for  up  to  3  years  after  menarche  and  for  1–2 
years  before  the  final  menstrual  period.  In  the 
intervening years, menstrual cycle length is ~28 
days,  with  an  intermenstrual  interval  normally 
ranging  between  25  and  35  days.  Cycle-to-
cycle variability in an individual woman who is 
ovulating  consistently  is  generally  +/−  2  days. 
Pregnancy is the most common cause of amen-
orrhea  and  should  be  excluded  early  in  any 
evaluation  of  menstrual  irregularity.  However, 
many women occasionally miss a single period. 
Three  months  of  secondary  amenorrhea,  or 
6  months  in  women  with  previously  irregular 
cycles,  should  prompt  an  evaluation,  as  should 
a history of intermenstrual intervals >35 or <21 
days or bleeding that persists for >7 days.

FIGURE 393-1  Role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in the etiology of amenorrhea. Gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus stimulates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and 
luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion from the pituitary to induce ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis. 
Ovarian  secretion  of  estradiol  and  progesterone  controls  the  shedding  of  the  endometrium,  resulting  in 
menses, and, in combination with the inhibins, provides feedback regulation of the hypothalamus and pituitary 
to control secretion of FSH and LH. The prevalence of amenorrhea resulting from abnormalities at each level 
of  the  reproductive  system  (hypothalamus,  pituitary,  ovary,  uterus,  and  outflow  tract)  varies  depending  on 
whether amenorrhea is primary or secondary. PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome.

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismpresents  as  secondary  amenorrhea  or  hypomenorrhea  and  results 
from  partial  or  complete  obliteration  of  the  uterine  cavity  by  adhe-
sions that prevent normal growth and shedding of the endometrium. 
Curettage performed for pregnancy complications accounts for >90% 
of cases; genital tuberculosis is an important cause in regions where it 
is endemic.

TREATMENT
Disorders of the Uterus or Outflow Tract
Obstruction of the outflow tract usually presents as dysmenorrhea 
or lower abdominal cyclic pain with no menses. Evaluation of the 
patient includes a medical history, physical examination including 
a perineal examination, and ultrasound imaging. In some cases, an 
MRI can more accurately identify the reproductive tract anomaly 
prior to surgery. It is important that surgery be performed as soon 
as the diagnosis is made as the risk of endometriosis is increased 
with  retrograde  menstrual  flow.  Müllerian  agenesis  may  require 
surgical intervention to allow sexual intercourse, although vaginal 
dilatation  is  adequate  in  some  patients.  Because  ovarian  function 
is  normal,  assisted  reproductive  techniques  can  be  used  with  a 
surrogate  carrier.  More  recently,  there  have  been  a  few  cases  of 
successful uterine transplantation in women with müllerian agen-
esis.  AIS  (Chap.  390)  requires  gonadectomy  because  there  is  risk 
of  gonadoblastoma  in  the  dysgenetic  gonads,  although  surgery  is 
generally  delayed  until  after  breast  development  and  the  pubertal 
growth spurt. Estrogen replacement is indicated after gonadectomy, 
and vaginal dilatation may be required to allow sexual intercourse.

Disorders of Ovulation  Once uterus and outflow tract abnormal-
ities have been excluded, other causes of amenorrhea involve disorders 
of ovulation. The differential diagnosis is based on the results of initial 
tests, including a pregnancy test, an FSH level (to determine whether 
the cause is likely to be ovarian or central), and assessment of hyperan-
drogenism (Fig. 393-2).

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM  Low estrogen levels in com-
bination  with  normal  or  low  levels  of  LH  and  FSH  are  seen  with 
anatomic, genetic, or functional abnormalities that interfere with hypo-
thalamic GnRH secretion or normal pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. 
Although relatively uncommon, tumors and infiltrative diseases should 
be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypo-
gonadism  (Chap.  380).  These  disorders  may  present  with  primary 
or secondary amenorrhea. They may occur in association with other 
features  suggestive  of  hypothalamic  or  pituitary  dysfunction,  such  as 
short stature, diabetes insipidus, galactorrhea, and headache. Hypogo-
nadotropic  hypogonadism  also  may  be  seen  after  cranial  irradiation. 
In the postpartum period, amenorrhea occurs normally in association 
with breast feeding but may also be caused by pituitary necrosis (Shee-
han’s  syndrome)  or  lymphocytic  hypophysitis.  Because  reproductive 
dysfunction  is  commonly  associated  with  hyperprolactinemia  from 
neuroanatomic lesions or medications, prolactin should be measured 
in all patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Chap. 380).

Isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) occurs in women, 
although  it  is  three  times  more  common  in  men.  IHH  generally 
presents  with  primary  amenorrhea,  although  50%  have  some  degree 
of  breast  development,  and  ~10%  report  one  to  two  menses.  IHH 
is  associated  with  anosmia  in  half  of  women  (termed  Kallmann’s 
syndrome).  Genetic  causes  of  IHH  have  been  identified  in  ~50%  of 
patients (Chaps. 391 and 392).

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a diagnosis of exclu-
sion  of  other  causes  of  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  including 
chronic  diseases  (type  1  diabetes,  celiac  disease,  hyperthyroidism, 
Cushing’s syndrome) and use of opioids, glucocorticoids, or psychotro-
pic medications that increase prolactin levels. Functional HA is most 
commonly  associated  with  conditions  causing  a  mismatch  between 
energy expenditure and energy intake and/or significant stress. Vari-
ants in genes associated with IHH may increase susceptibility to these 
environmental inputs, accounting in part for the clinical variability in 
this disorder. Metabolic and stress signaling is transduced to the repro-
ductive axis, at least in part, through leptin signaling from the periph-
ery and via hypothalamic kisspeptin control of GnRH. The diagnosis

3036 of HA generally can be made on the basis of a careful history, a physical 
examination,  and  the  demonstration  of  low  levels  of  gonadotropins 
and normal prolactin levels. Eating disorders, excessive exercise, and 
chronic  disease  must  be  specifically  excluded.  An  atypical  history, 
headache,  signs  of  other  hypothalamic  dysfunction,  or  hyperprolac-
tinemia, even if mild, necessitates cranial magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) to exclude a neuroanatomic cause. Up to 10% of women with 
HA  may  have  some  features  of  PCOS  (irregular  menses,  increased 
ovarian volume with polycystic appearing ovaries, higher anti-müllerian 
hormone [AMH] levels, and slightly elevated androgen levels).
HYPERGONADOTROPIC  HYPOGONADISM  Ovarian  failure  is  consid-
ered premature when it occurs in women <40 years old and accounts 
for  ~10%  of  secondary  amenorrhea.  Primary  ovarian  insufficiency 
(POI)  has  replaced  the  terms  premature  menopause  and  premature 
ovarian  failure  in  recognition  of  the  continuum  of  impaired  ovarian 
function encompassed by this disorder. Ovarian insufficiency is asso-
ciated with the loss of negative feedback restraint on the hypothalamus 
and pituitary, resulting in increased FSH and LH levels. FSH is a better 
marker of ovarian failure because of loss of negative feedback effects of 
both estradiol and the inhibins and because its levels are less variable 
than those of LH. AMH levels will also be low in patients with POI but 
are more frequently used in management of infertility. As with natural 
menopause,  POI  may  wax  and  wane,  and  serial  measurements  may 
be necessary to establish the diagnosis. The presentation may include 
irregular  menses  or  complete  cessation  of  menses,  hot  flashes,  and 
vaginal dryness.

Once the diagnosis of POI has been established, further evaluation 
is indicated because of other health problems that may be associated 
with POI. Although POI is most commonly of unknown cause, it also 
occurs  in  association  with  a  variety  of  chromosomal  abnormalities 
(most  often  Turner’s  syndrome),  autoimmune  polyglandular  failure 
syndromes, and other rare disorders. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
may reduce ovarian reserve, with effects on both the oocytes and the 
supporting granulosa cells. New approaches, including ovarian, oocyte, 
and embryo cryopreservation, should be offered to women of repro-
ductive  age  prior  to  gonadotoxic  chemotherapy  or  pelvic  radiation 
treatment.  The  recognition  that  early  ovarian  insufficiency  occurs  in 
premutation carriers of the fragile X syndrome is important because of 
the increased risk of severe intellectual disability in male children with 
FMR1 mutations. Thus, follow-up testing should include a karyotype 
in all POI patients, serum anti-cortical and 21-hydroxylase antibodies 
(specific  but  not  sensitive  for  subsequent  adrenal  insufficiency),  thy-
roid  function  and  thyroid  peroxidase  antibodies,  FMR1  premutation 
screening,  and  assessment  of  bone  mineral  density.  Ovarian  biopsy 
is  not  indicated.  Although  the  number  of  genetic  causes  of  POI  is 
increasing, routine testing for mutations other than FMR1 is currently 
not recommended.

Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism occurs rarely in other disorders, 
such as mutations in the FSH or LH receptors. Aromatase deficiency 
and 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are associated with decreased estrogen 
and  elevated  gonadotropins  and  with  hyperandrogenism  and  hyper-
tension,  respectively.  Gonadotropin-secreting  tumors  in  women  of 
reproductive age generally present with high, rather than low, estrogen 
levels and cause ovarian hyperstimulation or dysfunctional bleeding.

TREATMENT
Hypo- and Hypergonadotropic Causes of Amenorrhea
Amenorrhea almost always is associated with chronically low levels 
of  estrogen,  whether  it  is  caused  by  hypogonadotropic  hypogo-
nadism or ovarian insufficiency. Development of secondary sexual 
characteristics  requires  gradual  titration  of  estradiol  replacement 
with  eventual  addition  of  progestin.  Hormone  replacement  with 
either  low-dose  estrogen/progesterone  regimens  or  oral  contra-
ceptive  pills  is  recommended  until  the  usual  age  of  menopause 
for bone and cardiovascular protection. In women with functional 
HA  or  anorexia  nervosa,  hormone  replacement  alone  may  not 
be  sufficient  to  restore  or  maintain  bone  density.  Patients  with 

hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  who  are  interested  in  fertility 
require treatment with both exogenous FSH and LH. Patients with 
POI can consider oocyte donation, which has a high rate of success 
in  this  population,  although  its  use  in  women  with  Turner’s  syn-
drome is limited by significant cardiovascular risk in pregnancy.

POLYCYSTIC  OVARIAN  SYNDROME  The  diagnosis  of  PCOS  is  made 
in  adult  women  using  the  Rotterdam  criteria:  irregular  menses  (<8 
menses per year), clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism (elevated 
total  or  free  testosterone,  modified  Ferriman-Gallwey  score  >4–6 
depending on ethnicity, see Chap. 394), and polycystic-appearing ova-
ries on ultrasound (≥20 antral follicles or ovarian volume ≥10 cm3 in at 
least one ovary). The presence of two of the three criteria will confirm 
the diagnosis, resulting in different phenotypes, namely, hyperandro-
genic or non-hyperandrogenic. PCOS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and 
other  etiologies  for  irregular  menses  and  hyperandrogenism  should 
be  excluded  (hypothyroidism,  hyperprolactinemia,  adrenal  sources 
for  hyperandrogenism).  Diagnosis  in  adolescents  maybe  difficult  to 
establish, and it is recommended to wait at least 3 years after menarche 
before confirming the diagnosis. In adolescents, the diagnosis is based 
on irregular menses and hyperandrogenism criteria only, as the ultra-
sound criteria are not established for this age group. The prevalence of 
obesity is high in PCOS and significantly increases the risk of comor-
bidities including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, 
and hypertension. The failure of regular ovulation results in irregular 
menses  and  increased  risk  of  endometrial  hyperplasia  and  endome-
trial  cancer  (two-  to  sixfold  increased  risk).  Abnormalities  in  GnRH 
pulsatility result in elevated LH and increased production of ovarian 
androgens. Insulin resistance associated with PCOS may also contrib-
ute to increased insulin-stimulated ovarian androgen production. An 
alternate  source  of  androgens,  namely  11-oxygenated  androgens,  has 
also been shown to be elevated in women with PCOS. Genome-wide 
association studies in diverse populations and PCOS phenotypes have 
identified  several  loci  associated  with  PCOS.  Symptoms  generally 
begin  in  adolescence  and  are  modified  by  obesity  and  age,  such  that 
by the fourth decade of life, most women with PCOS will have regular 
menses  and  normal  serum  androgens.  Lean  oligo-ovulatory  patients 
with  PCOS  generally  have  high  LH  levels  in  the  presence  of  normal 
to  low  levels  of  FSH  and  estradiol,  although  given  the  pulsatility  of 
LH  secretion,  a  random  serum  LH/FSH  ratio  is  not  included  in  the 
diagnostic criteria.

TREATMENT
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
The first-line treatment of women with PCOS not attempting preg-
nancy is combined hormonal contraceptives to regulate menstrual 
cycles and decrease serum androgens by increasing sex hormone–
binding  globulin  levels.  Although  serum  androgens  decrease  by 
3  months  after  initiating  hormonal  therapy,  it  may  take  longer  to 
observe the beneficial effects on hirsutism and acne. Patients should 
be evaluated for metabolic comorbidities and given hormonal con-
traceptives containing the lowest effective dose of estrogen, either 
in a cyclic or continuous manner. If there is an inadequate response 
to  hormonal  contraceptives  for  management  of  hyperandrogenic 
symptoms,  antiandrogens,  such  as  spironolactone  and  flutamide, 
can be considered (Chap. 394). Endometrial protection can also be 
achieved with the use of progestins (medroxyprogesterone acetate, 
5–10 mg, or Prometrium [progesterone], 200 mg daily for 10–14 days 
at  least  every  3  months,  or  a  levonorgestrel  intrauterine  device 
[IUD]).  All  women  with  PCOS  should  be  screened  for  obesity, 
hypertension,  and  glycemic  control  at  the  time  of  diagnosis  and 
then  at  regular  intervals.  Overweight  and  obese  women  should 
also  have  a  fasting  lipid  profile  at  the  time  of  diagnosis.  Lifestyle 
management  should  be  recommended  in  all  women  with  PCOS, 
and metformin should be considered for managing cardiometabolic 
risk factors (Chap. 408). Women with PCOS are at an increased risk 
of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia.

Lifestyle management is the first-line treatment prior to attempting 
pregnancy  (Chap.  396).  Letrozole,  an  aromatase  inhibitor,  and 
clomiphene  citrate,  a  selective  estrogen  response  modulator,  are 
effective  first-line  treatments  for  ovulation  induction.  Exogenous 
gonadotropins can be used by experienced practitioners; a diagnosis 
of polycystic ovaries increases the risk of hyperstimulation, even in 
women with regular, ovulatory menstrual cycles. Metformin is fre-
quently used in patients with PCOS and is appropriate as an adjunct 
with diet and exercise for obese women with PCOS or for treatment 
of diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, as in non-PCOS patients. 
However,  metformin  alone  is  not  recommended  for  endometrial 
protection  or  treatment  of  hyperandrogenic  symptoms,  infertility, 
pregnancy loss, or prevention of gestational diabetes.

 ■ PELVIC PAIN
The mechanisms that cause pelvic pain are similar to those that cause 
abdominal pain (Chap. 15) and include inflammation of the parietal 
peritoneum, obstruction of hollow viscera, vascular disturbances, and 
pain originating in the abdominal wall. Pelvic pain may reflect pelvic 
disease per se but also may reflect extrapelvic disorders that refer pain 
to the pelvis. In up to 60% of cases, pelvic pain can be attributed to gas-
trointestinal problems, including appendicitis, cholecystitis, infections, 
intestinal obstruction, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. 
Urinary tract and musculoskeletal disorders are also common causes 
of pelvic pain.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Pelvic Pain
As  with  all  types  of  abdominal  pain,  the  first  priority  is  to  iden-
tify  life-threatening  conditions  (shock,  peritoneal  signs)  that  may 
require  emergent  surgical  management.  The  possibility  of  preg-
nancy should be identified as soon as possible by menstrual history 
and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) testing. A thorough 
history  that  includes  the  type,  location,  radiation,  and  recurrence 
can help identify the cause of acute pelvic pain. Specific associations 
with vaginal bleeding, sexual activity, defecation, urination, move-
ment,  or  eating  should  be  specifically  sought.  Determination  of 
whether the pain is acute versus chronic and cyclic versus noncyclic 
will direct further investigation (Table 393-1). However, disorders 
that cause cyclic pain occasionally may cause noncyclic pain, and 
the converse is also true.

 ■ ACUTE PELVIC PAIN
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) refers to infection of the upper gen-
ital tract and may present with a spectrum of symptoms. In the acute 
setting,  the  most  common  presentation  is  bilateral  lower  abdominal 
pain of recent onset that may be exacerbated with sexual activity. Risk

factors for PID include history of multiple sexual partners, prior sexu-
ally transmitted infections (STIs), history of recent uterine procedures, 
and age <25 years. However, any sexually active woman can be at risk 
for  PID.  PID  associated  with  tubo-ovarian  abscess  or  peritonitis  may 
present with severe pain, fever, and peritoneal signs. Abnormal uterine 
bleeding may occur in about one-third of patients. Cervical motion ten-
derness, uterine and adnexal pain, and vaginal discharge are common 
findings on pelvic examination. The presence of right upper quadrant 
pain is suggestive of perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).

The diagnosis of PID is established based on symptoms and clinical 
examination and can be aided by a wet mount preparation of vaginal 
discharge and nucleic acid amplification tests for Chlamydia trachomatis 
and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Of note, a presumptive clinical diagnosis is 
sufficient  to  prescribe  treatment  even  in  the  absence  of  positive  test 
results, as PID can occur due to other vaginal and enteric pathogens. 
Pelvic  imaging  can  be  obtained  based  on  symptoms,  findings  of  the 
pelvic  examination,  or  if  there  is  lack  of  response  to  therapy.  With 
public health efforts to control STIs, the incidence and severity of PID 
have declined in the United States and Europe; however, this is not the 
case in the developing world. Subclinical PID with its attendant risks of 
infertility and ectopic pregnancy remains a significant problem world-
wide. Public health and professional organizations recommend annual 
testing  for  C.  trachomatis  in  all  sexually  active  women  <25  years  old 
and both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women at increased 
risk. Adnexal pathology can present acutely and may be due to rupture, 
bleeding, or torsion of ovarian cysts or, much less commonly, the fallo-
pian tubes. Rupture of an ovarian cyst may be diagnosed based on the 
acute presentation in a reproductive-age woman and pelvic ultrasound 
findings  of  a  simple,  collapsed  or  hemorrhagic  cyst,  with  or  without 
free  fluid  in  the  pelvis.  Ovarian  torsion  typically  presents  as  acute 
onset  of  unilateral,  intermittent  pain  and  is  a  diagnosis  of  exclusion 
unless  absent  blood  flow  to  the  ovary  is  demonstrated  via  Doppler 
ultrasound imaging. Neoplasms of the ovary or fallopian tube are much 
less common causes of acute pain. Ectopic pregnancy represents 2% of 
all  pregnancies  and  most  commonly  occurs  in  the  fallopian  tubes.  It 
may present with acute lower abdominal pain, hemodynamic instabil-
ity, and peritoneal signs. The index of suspicion should be high in any 
reproductive-age  woman  presenting  with  abdominal  pain  or  vaginal 
bleeding irrespective of current use of contraception. Risk factors for 
an ectopic pregnancy include history of tubal disease, pelvic infection, 
tubal surgery, previous ectopic pregnancy, infertility, smoking, and cur-
rent use of IUD, although a large proportion may have no risk factors. 
Rupture of the fallopian tube remains a life-threatening emergency; the 
incidence depends on access to care but is ~18% in developed coun-
tries. Diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy can be established by assess-
ing the patient’s menstrual history and symptoms, measuring β-hCG 
levels, and performing pelvic ultrasound imaging. The discriminatory 
zone refers to β-hCG values above which the landmarks of a normal 
intrauterine pregnancy should be seen on ultrasound. Absence of an 
intrauterine pregnancy and presence of an adnexal mass or free fluid 
increase  the  likelihood  of  an  ectopic  pregnancy.  Threatened  abortion 
may also present with amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and vaginal bleed-
ing in the setting of an intrauterine pregnancy with cardiac activity in 
the first trimester of pregnancy. Although more common than ectopic 
pregnancy, it is rarely associated with systemic signs. Uterine pathology 
includes  endometritis  and,  less  frequently,  degenerating  leiomyomas 
(fibroids) present with acute pain. Endometritis often is associated with 
vaginal bleeding and systemic signs of infection. It occurs in the setting 
of STIs, uterine instrumentation, or postpartum infection.

TREATMENT
Acute Pelvic Pain
Treatment of acute pelvic pain depends on the suspected etiology 
but  may  require  surgical  or  gynecologic  intervention.  Immediate 
treatment of PID is indicated upon diagnosis, even if the diagnosis 
is presumed or the symptoms are mild, due to long-term compli-
cations resulting in increased risk of ectopic pregnancy and infer-
tility.  Treatment  in  patents  eligible  for  outpatient  management

includes  250  mg  IM  ceftriaxone  and  a  14-day  course  of  oral 
doxycycline  100  mg  twice  daily.  If  the  presentation  is  acute 
with  high  fever,  nausea,  vomiting,  severe  abdominal  pain,  or 
presence  of  tubo-ovarian  abscess,  inpatient  therapy  is  recom-
mended (Chap. 136). Conservative management is an important 
consideration for ovarian cysts, if torsion is not suspected, to avoid 
unnecessary surgery and associated risks of reduced fertility due to 
cystectomy  or  adhesions.  If  surgery  is  performed,  it  is  preferable 
to  perform  a  cystectomy,  removing  the  cyst  wall  and  leaving  the 
remaining  ovary,  in  a  reproductive-age  woman.  Combined  hor-
monal contraceptives are recommended in women with a history 
of  recurrent  ovarian  cyst  formation.  Surgical  treatment  may  be 
required  for  ectopic  pregnancies  when  the  patient  presents  with 
acute pain, is hemodynamically unstable, or has signs of intraperi-
toneal bleeding. The choice of salpingectomy versus salpingostomy 
is  based  on  patient’s  presentation,  desire  for  future  child  bearing, 
and prior pelvic infections. Clinically stable women presenting with 
unruptured ectopic pregnancies may be appropriate for treatment 
with methotrexate, which is effective in ~90% of cases when multi-
ple doses are used. Threatened abortion is managed conservatively 
even in the presence of a subchorionic hemorrhage. The treatment 
of endometritis is similar to PID. Pain from a degenerating fibroid, 
if visualized on pelvic sonography, can be managed with nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN
Chronic pelvic pain is a complex condition resulting from gynecologic, 
urologic, or gastrointestinal organs and contributes to significant frus-
tration and burden of disease. Common gynecologic conditions con-
tributing to chronic pain are endometriosis, fibroids, adenomyosis, and 
adnexal pathology. Estimated prevalence rates range from 5 to 20% for 
cyclic and noncyclic pain. In addition to a detailed history and physical 
exam, the evaluation of chronic pelvic pain typically includes a pelvic 
ultrasound. As causes other than those related to the female reproduc-
tive system are common, referral should be made to other specialists, 
as  appropriate.  Neuromuscular  and  psychosomatic  etiologies  should 
also be considered.

Some women experience discomfort at the time of ovulation (mit-
telschmerz  or  ovulation  pain).  The  pain  can  be  quite  intense  but  is 
generally of short duration. The mechanism is thought to involve rapid 
expansion of the dominant follicle, although it also may be caused by 
peritoneal irritation by follicular fluid released at the time of ovulation.
Dysmenorrhea typically refers to the crampy lower abdominal mid-
line discomfort that begins with the onset of menstrual bleeding and 
gradually  decreases  over  12–72  h.  It  may  be  associated  with  nausea, 
diarrhea, fatigue, and headache and occurs in 60–93% of adolescents, 
beginning  with  the  establishment  of  regular  ovulatory  cycles.  Its 
prevalence decreases after pregnancy and with the use of oral contra-
ceptives.  Primary  dysmenorrhea  results,  in  a  majority  of  cases,  from 
hormone-dependent  prostaglandin  (PG)  pathway  mechanisms  that 
cause intense uterine contractions, decreased blood flow, and increased 
peripheral nerve hypersensitivity, resulting in pain. However, variability 
in response to cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests that PG-independent 
pathways, such as platelet activating factor, may also mediate inflamma-
tion. Secondary dysmenorrhea is caused by underlying pelvic pathology.
Endometriosis results from the presence of endometrial glands and 
stroma  outside  the  uterus.  These  deposits  of  ectopic  endometrium 
respond  to  hormonal  stimulation  and  are  associated  with  dysmen-
orrhea,  painful  intercourse,  painful  bowel  movements,  and  tender 
nodules that may be palpated along the uterosacral ligaments during 
pelvic exam. The stage/severity of endometriosis does not always cor-
relate with the extent of pain, and pain associated with endometriosis 
can be cyclic or continuous. Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound is part of 
the initial workup and may detect an endometrioma within the ovary 
or, in severe cases, rectovaginal or bladder nodules. The CA125 level 
may be increased, but it has low negative predictive value. Diagnostic 
laparoscopy  is  performed  when  patients  do  not  respond  to  empiric 
treatment. If endometriosis is detected, the severity can be staged and 

the endometriotic lesions ablated or excised. The prevalence is lower in 
black and Hispanic women than in Caucasians and Asians.

Large fibroids can cause chronic pelvic pain or pressure, and submu-
cosal fibroids may be associated with dysmenorrhea. Other secondary 
causes  of  dysmenorrhea  include  adenomyosis,  a  condition  caused 
by  the  presence  of  ectopic  endometrial  glands  and  stroma  within  the 
myometrium. Chronic PID maybe associated with ongoing pelvic pain 
and is associated with tuberculosis or actinomycosis. Pelvic congestion 
syndrome is associated with pelvic varicosities with low blood flow, result-
ing in pelvic venous congestion. However, this is no clear evidence to 
indicate that this finding is associated with chronic pelvic pain.

TREATMENT
Chronic Pelvic Pain

DYSMENORRHEA
Local application of heat is of some benefit. Exercise, sexual activ-
ity, a vegetarian diet, use of vitamins D, B1, B6, and E and fish oil, 
acupuncture, and yoga have all been suggested to be of benefit, but 
studies  are  not  adequate  to  provide  recommendations.  However, 
NSAIDs  are  very  effective  and  provide  >80%  sustained  response 
rates. Ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, mefanamic acid, and nime-
sulide  are  all  superior  to  placebo.  For  best  response,  treatment 
should be initiated prior to the onset of menses and continued for 
at least 2–3 days. Combined oral contraceptives taken cyclically or 
continuously effectively reduce symptoms of dysmenorrhea. 
ENDOMETRIOSIS
Combined  hormonal  contraceptives  or  continuous  progestin 
(either  orally  or  a  levonorgestrel  IUD)  are  used  for  the  treatment 
of  endometriosis.  Evidence  of  an  endometrioma  on  ultrasound 
imaging can be medically managed and does not require surgical 
removal  unless  symptomatic.  Patients  who  do  not  respond  to 
medical management and laparoscopic resection of endometriotic 
lesions  can  be  offered  GnRH  agonist  suppression  with  add-back 
therapy or aromatase inhibitors.

Chronic  pain  and  dysmenorrhea  associated  with  fibroids  can 
be  managed  surgically  depending  on  the  number  and  location  of 
fibroids and associated symptoms. Chronic pain and dysmenorrhea 
associated with adenomyosis can be managed with combined hor-
monal  treatment,  levonorgestrel  IUD,  or  hysterectomy  after  child 
bearing is complete.

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolism394 Hirsutism

David A. Ehrmann

 ■ DEFINING HIRSUTISM
Body hair can be categorized as either vellus (fine, soft, and not pig-
mented) or terminal (long, coarse, and pigmented). Approximately 10% 
of reproductive age women have hirsutism, defined by the presence of 
excessive terminal hair growth. Hirsutism is most often idiopathic or 
the consequence of androgen excess associated with polycystic ovary 
syndrome  (PCOS).  Less  frequently,  it  results  from  adrenal  androgen 
overproduction as occurs in nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
(CAH) (Table 394-1). Androgenization or virilization refers to a condi-
tion in which androgen levels are sufficiently high to cause deepening 
of the voice, breast atrophy, increased muscle bulk, clitoromegaly, and 
increased libido. Androgenization may be caused by benign hyperpla-
sia of ovarian theca and stroma cells (e.g., hyperthecosis); it may also 
be a harbinger of a serious underlying condition, such as an ovarian 
or adrenal neoplasm. Cutaneous manifestations commonly associated 
with  hirsutism  include  acne  and  hair  thinning  or  pattern  hair  loss 
(androgenic alopecia).

 ■ HAIR FOLLICLE GROWTH AND 
DIFFERENTIATION
The number of hair follicles remains unchanged over the life span, but 
follicle size and the type of hair can change in response to numerous

factors, particularly androgens. Androgens are necessary for terminal 
hair  and  sebaceous  gland  development  and  mediate  differentiation 
of  pilosebaceous  units  (PSUs)  into  a  terminal  hair  follicle  and/or  a 
sebaceous  gland.  In  the  former  case,  androgens  transform  the  vellus 
hair into a terminal hair; in the latter case, the sebaceous component 
proliferates and the hair remains vellus.

There  are  three  phases  in  the  cycle  of  hair  growth:  (1)  anagen 
(growth  phase),  (2)  catagen  (involution  phase),  and  (3)  telogen  (rest 
phase). Depending on the body site, hormonal regulation may play an 
important role in the hair growth cycle. Hair growth on the face, chest, 
upper abdomen, and back typically requires elevated androgen concen-
trations. However, there is only a modest correlation between androgen 
levels and the quantity of hair growth. This is due to the fact that hair 
growth from the follicle also depends on local growth factors, and the 
variability in end-organ (PSU) sensitivity to androgens. Genetic factors 
and  ethnic  background  also  influence  hair  growth.  Androgen  excess 
in women may result in hair thinning or loss because androgens cause 
scalp hairs to spend less time in the anagen phase.

In  general,  dark-haired  individuals  tend  to  be  more  hirsute  than 
blond or fair individuals. Asians and Native Americans have relatively 
sparse hair in regions sensitive to high androgen levels, whereas people 
of Mediterranean descent are more hirsute.

 ■ CLINICAL ASSESSMENT
Historic elements relevant to the assessment of hirsutism include the 
age  at  onset  and  rate  of  progression  of  hair  growth  and  associated 
symptoms  or  signs  (e.g.,  menstrual  irregularity  and  acne).  Depend-
ing  on  the  cause,  excess  hair  growth  typically  is  first  noted  during 
the  second  and  third  decades  of  life.  The  growth  is  usually  slow  but 
progressive. Sudden development and rapid progression of hirsutism 
suggest  the  possibility  of  an  androgen-secreting  neoplasm,  in  which 
case androgenization may also be present.

The  age  at  onset  of  menstrual  cycles  (menarche)  and  the  pattern 
of  the  menstrual  cycle  should  be  ascertained;  oligomenorrhea  (<8 
cycles per calendar year) from the time of menarche onward is more 
likely  to  result  from  ovarian  than  adrenal  androgen  excess.  Asso-
ciated  symptoms  such  as  galactorrhea  should  prompt  evaluation 
for  hyperprolactinemia  (Chap.  380)  or  possibly  hypothyroidism 
(Chap.  382).  Hypertension,  striae,  easy  bruising,  and  centripetal 
weight gain suggest hypercortisolism (Cushing’s syndrome; Chap. 386). 
Rarely, patients with acromegaly present with hirsutism. Medications 
such  as  phenytoin,  minoxidil,  and  cyclosporine  may  be  associated 
with  androgen-independent  excess  hair  growth  (i.e.,  hypertrichosis). 
A family history of infertility and/or hirsutism may indicate inherited 
disorders such as nonclassic CAH (Chap. 386).

Physical  examination  should  include  measurement  of  height  and 
weight and calculation of body mass index (BMI). A BMI >25 kg/m2 is 
indicative of excess weight for height, and values >30 kg/m2 are often 
seen  in  association  with  hirsutism,  probably  the  result  of  increased 
conversion  of  androgen  precursors  to  testosterone.  Notation  should 
be  made  of  blood  pressure,  as  adrenal  causes  may  be  associated  with 
hypertension.  Cutaneous  signs  sometimes  associated  with  androgen 
excess and insulin resistance include acanthosis nigricans and skin tags.
An  objective  clinical  assessment  of  hair  distribution  and  quantity 
is  central  to  the  evaluation  in  any  woman  presenting  with  concerns 
about  excessive  hair  growth.  This  assessment  permits  the  distinction 
between hirsutism and hypertrichosis and provides a baseline reference 
point to gauge the response to treatment. A simple and commonly used 
method  to  grade  hair  growth  is  the  modified  scale  of  Ferriman  and 
Gallwey  (Fig.  394-1),  in  which  each  of  nine  androgen-sensitive  sites 
is graded from 0 (no hair growth) to 4 (hair growth typically seen in 
adult men). Although it is normal for most women to have some hair 
growth  in  androgen-sensitive  sites,  ~95%  of  non-hispanic  white  and 
African-American women have a score <8 on this scale. Scores >8 sug-
gest excess androgen-mediated hair growth, a finding that should be 
assessed further by means of hormonal evaluation (see below). Asian 
and Native American women are less likely to manifest hirsutism, and 
the only cutaneous evidence of androgen excess may be pustular acne 
and thinning scalp hair.

 ■ HORMONAL EVALUATION
Androgens are secreted by the ovaries and adrenal glands in response 
to  their  respective  tropic  hormones:  luteinizing  hormone  (LH)  and 
adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH).  Testosterone  is  the  principal 
circulating  steroid  involved  in  the  etiology  of  hirsutism;  other  ste-
roids  that  may  contribute  to  the  development  of  hirsutism  include 

androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated 
form  (DHEAS).  The  ovaries  and  adrenal  glands  normally  contribute 
about  equally  to  testosterone  production.  Approximately  half  of  the 
total  testosterone  originates  from  direct  glandular  secretion,  and  the 
remainder is derived from the peripheral conversion of androstenedi-
one and DHEA (Chap. 381).

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismTestosterone is the most important circulating androgen, but it is a 
precursor hormone in mediating hirsutism. Testosterone is converted 
to  dihydrotestosterone  (DHT)  by  the  enzyme  5α-reductase,  which  is 
located in the PSU. DHT is more potent than testosterone as it has a 
higher affinity for, and slower dissociation from, the androgen receptor. 
The local production of DHT allows it to serve as the primary mediator 
of androgen action at the level of the PSU. There are two isoenzymes of 
5α-reductase: type 2 is found in the prostate gland and in hair follicles, 
and type 1 is found primarily in sebaceous glands.

One  approach  to  the  evaluation  and  treatment  of  hirsutism  is 
depicted in Fig. 394-2. In addition to measuring blood levels of testos-
terone  and  DHEAS,  it  is  often  important  to  measure  the  level  of  free 
(or unbound) testosterone, i.e., the fraction of testosterone that is not 
bound  to  its  carrier  protein,  sex  hormone–binding  globulin  (SHBG). 
Unbound  testosterone  is  biologically  available  for  conversion  to  DHT 
and binding to androgen receptors. Both hyperinsulinemia and andro-
gen excess decrease hepatic production of SHBG, resulting in levels of 
total testosterone within the high-normal range, whereas the unbound 
hormone  is  elevated  more  substantially.  Although  there  is  a  decline 
in  ovarian  testosterone  production  after  menopause,  ovarian  estrogen 
production decreases to an even greater extent, and the concentration 
of SHBG is reduced. Consequently, there is an increase in the relative 
proportion  of  unbound  testosterone,  and  it  may  exacerbate  hirsutism 
after menopause.

A  baseline  plasma  total  testosterone  level  >12  nmol/L  (>3.5  ng/mL) 
usually  indicates  an  androgen-producing  tumor,  whereas  a  level 
>7 nmol/L (>2 ng/mL) is suggestive of tumor but may also be observed 
in  women  with  hyperthecosis.  A  basal  DHEAS  level  >18.5  μmol/L 
(>7000 μg/L) suggests an adrenal tumor. Although DHEAS has been 
proposed as a “marker” of predominant adrenal androgen excess, it is 
not unusual to find modest elevations in DHEAS among women with 
PCOS.  Computed  tomography  (CT)  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging 
(MRI)  should  be  used  to  localize  an  adrenal  mass,  and  ultrasound 
usually suffices to identify an ovarian mass if clinical evaluation and 
hormonal levels suggest these possibilities.

PCOS  is  the  most  common  cause  of  ovarian  androgen  excess 
(Chap.  392).  An  increased  ratio  of  LH  to  follicle-stimulating  hor-
mone (FSH) is characteristic in carefully studied patients with PCOS. 
However, because of the pulsatile nature of gonadotropin secretion, a 
random measurement of LH and FSH may be misleading and is not 
recommended.  Transvaginal  ultrasound  classically  shows  enlarged 
ovaries, increased stroma, and multiple “cysts” in women with PCOS. 
These so-called cysts are, in fact, preantral and early antral follicles that 
result from abnormal follicular maturation. “Cystic” ovaries also may 
be found in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (Chap. 392) and 
even among women without clinical or laboratory features of PCOS. 
Thus, ultrasonography is often not needed to diagnose PCOS given its 
relatively low specificity and its high degree of operator dependence.

Because adrenal androgens are readily suppressed by low doses of 
glucocorticoids,  the  dexamethasone  androgen-suppression  test  may 
broadly  distinguish  ovarian  from  adrenal  androgen  overproduction. 
A  blood  sample  is  obtained  before  and  after  the  administration  of 
dexamethasone (0.5 mg orally every 6 h for 4 days). An adrenal source 
is suggested by suppression of unbound testosterone into the normal 
range;  incomplete  suppression  suggests  ovarian  androgen  excess.  An 
overnight  1-mg  dexamethasone  suppression  test,  with  measurement 
of 8:00 a.m. serum cortisol, is useful when there is clinical suspicion of 
Cushing’s syndrome (Chap. 386).

Nonclassic  CAH  is  most  commonly  due  to  21-hydroxylase  defi-
ciency but also can be caused by autosomal recessive defects in other 
steroidogenic  enzymes  necessary  for  adrenal  corticosteroid  synthesis 
(Chap. 386). Because of the enzyme defect, the adrenal gland cannot 
secrete  glucocorticoids  (especially  cortisol)  efficiently.  This  results 
in  diminished  negative  feedback  inhibition  of  ACTH,  leading  to 
compensatory  adrenal  hyperplasia  and  the  accumulation  of  steroid 
precursors  that  subsequently  are  converted  to  androgen.  Deficiency 
of 21-hydroxylase can be reliably excluded by determining a morning 
17-hydroxyprogesterone  level  <6  nmol/L  (<2  μg/L)  (drawn  in  the 
follicular phase). Alternatively, 21-hydroxylase deficiency can be diag-
nosed by measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone 1 h after the admin-
istration of 250 μg of synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin) intravenously.

TREATMENT
Hirsutism

Treatment  of  hirsutism  may  be  accomplished  pharmacologically 
or by mechanical means of hair removal. Nonpharmacologic treat-
ments should be considered in all patients either as the only treat-
ment or as an adjunct to drug therapy.

Nonpharmacologic treatments include (1) bleaching, (2) depil-
atory (removal from the skin surface) such as shaving and chem-
ical  treatments,  and  (3)  epilatory  (removal  of  the  hair  including 
the  root)  such  as  plucking,  waxing,  electrolysis,  laser,  and  intense 
pulsed light (IPL). Despite perceptions to the contrary, shaving does 
not increase the rate or density of hair growth. Chemical depilatory 
treatments may be useful for mild hirsutism that affects only limited 
skin areas, although they can cause skin irritation. Wax treatment 
removes hair temporarily but is uncomfortable. Electrolysis is effec-
tive for more permanent hair removal, particularly in the hands of 
a skilled electrologist. Laser and IPL are used to treat large areas of 
pigmented,  terminal  hair.  Light  of  specific  wavelength,  duration, 
and energy is absorbed by melanin in the hair shaft and follicle lead-
ing to photothermolysis. Properly delivered, this treatment delays 
hair regrowth and causes permanent hair removal in many patients.
Pharmacologic therapy is directed at interrupting one or more of 
the steps in the pathway of androgen synthesis and action: (1) suppres-
sion  of  adrenal  and/or  ovarian  androgen  production,  (2)  enhance-
ment  of  androgen-binding  to  plasma-binding  proteins,  particularly 
SHBG,  (3)  impairment  of  the  peripheral  conversion  of  androgen 
precursors to active androgen, and (4) inhibition of androgen action 
at the target tissue level. Attenuation of hair growth is typically not 
evident until 4–6 months after initiation of medical treatment and, in 
most cases, leads to only a modest reduction in hair growth.

Combination estrogen-progestin therapy in the form of an oral 
contraceptive is usually the first-line endocrine treatment for hir-
sutism  and  acne,  after  cosmetic  and  dermatologic  management. 
The estrogenic component of most oral contraceptives currently in 
use is either ethinyl estradiol or mestranol. The suppression of LH 
leads  to  reduced  production  of  ovarian  androgens.  The  reduced 
androgen levels also result in a dose-related increase in SHBG, thus 
lowering  the  fraction  of  unbound  plasma  testosterone.  Estrogens 
also have a direct, dose-dependent suppressive effect on sebaceous 
cell function.

The  choice  of  a  specific  oral  contraceptive  should  be  pred-
icated  on  the  progestational  component,  as  progestins  vary  in 
their  suppressive  effect  on  SHBG  levels  and  in  their  androgenic 

potential. Ethynodiol diacetate has relatively low androgenic poten-
tial,  whereas  progestins  such  as  norgestrel  and  levonorgestrel  are 
particularly  androgenic,  as  judged  from  their  attenuation  of  the 
estrogen-induced  increase  in  SHBG.  Norgestimate  exemplifies 
the  newer  generation  of  progestins  that  are  virtually  nonandro-
genic. Drospirenone, an analogue of spironolactone that has both 
antimineralocorticoid  and  antiandrogenic  activities,  is  commonly 
used as a progestational agent in combination with ethinyl estradiol.
Oral  contraceptives  are  contraindicated  in  women  with  a  his-
tory of thromboembolic disease and women with increased risk of 
breast or other estrogen-dependent cancers (Chap. 395). There is a 
relative contraindication to the use of oral contraceptives in smok-
ers and those with hypertension or a history of migraine headaches. 
In most trials, estrogen-progestin therapy alone improves the extent 
of acne by a maximum of 50–70%. The effect on hair growth may 
not be evident for 6 months, and the maximum effect may require 
9–12 months owing to the length of the hair growth cycle. Improve-
ments in hirsutism are typically in the range of 20%, but there may 
be an arrest of further progression of hair growth.

Because oral contraceptives are efficacious and have fewer side 
effects,  they  are  recommended  over  glucocorticoids  as  first-line 
treatment of hirsutism in CAH. If the response to oral contracep-
tives is inadequate, glucocorticoids may be used. The lowest effec-
tive  dose  of  glucocorticoid  should  be  used  (e.g.,  dexamethasone 
[0.2–0.5 mg] or prednisone [5–10 mg]) taken at bedtime to achieve 
maximal suppression by inhibiting the nocturnal surge of ACTH.

Cyproterone  acetate  is  the  prototypic  antiandrogen.  It  acts 
mainly  by  competitive  inhibition  of  the  binding  of  testosterone 
and DHT to the androgen receptor. In addition, it may enhance the 
metabolic  clearance  of  testosterone  by  inducing  hepatic  enzymes. 
Although  not  available  for  use  in  the  United  States,  cyproterone 
acetate is widely used in Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Cyproterone 
(50–100  mg)  is  given  on  days  1–15,  and  ethinyl  estradiol  (50  μg) 
is  given  on  days  5–26  of  the  menstrual  cycle.  Side  effects  include 
irregular uterine bleeding, nausea, headache, fatigue, weight gain, 
and decreased libido.

Spironolactone,  which  usually  is  used  as  a  mineralocorticoid 
antagonist,  is  also  a  weak  antiandrogen.  It  is  almost  as  effec-
tive  as  cyproterone  acetate  when  used  at  high  enough  doses 
(100–200  mg  daily).  Patients  should  be  monitored  intermittently 
for  hyperkalemia  or  hypotension,  though  these  side  effects  are 
uncommon.  Pregnancy  should  be  avoided  because  of  the  risk  of 
feminization of a male fetus. Spironolactone can also cause men-
strual  irregularity.  It  often  is  used  in  combination  with  an  oral 
contraceptive, which suppresses ovarian androgen production and 
helps prevent pregnancy.

Flutamide is a potent nonsteroidal antiandrogen that is effective 
in treating hirsutism, but concerns about the induction of hepato-
cellular  dysfunction  preclude  its  use.  Finasteride  is  a  competitive 
inhibitor  of  5α-reductase  type  2.  Beneficial  effects  on  hirsutism 
have been reported, but the predominance of 5α-reductase type 1 
in the PSU appears to account for its limited efficacy. Finasteride 
would also be expected to impair sexual differentiation in a male 
fetus,  and  it  should  not  be  used  in  women  who  may  become 
pregnant.  Although  studies  of  dutasteride  are  limited  in  number, 
it  appears  that  this  agent  may  have  efficacy  in  treating  scalp  hair 
thinning  and  loss  as  well  as  hirsutism.  Dutasteride  differs  from 
finasteride as it targets 5α-reductase types 1 and 2.

Ultimately, the choice of any specific agent(s) must be tailored to 
the unique needs of the patient being treated. As noted previously, 
pharmacologic treatments for hirsutism should be used in conjunc-
tion with nonpharmacologic approaches. It is also helpful to review 
the pattern of female hair distribution in the normal population to 
dispel unrealistic expectations.

395 Menopause and 
Postmenopausal Hormone 
Therapy
JoAnn E. Manson, Shari S. Bassuk

Menopause  is  the  permanent  cessation  of  menstruation  due  to  loss 
of  ovarian  follicular  function.  It  is  diagnosed  retrospectively  after 
12  months  of  amenorrhea.  The  average  age  at  menopause  is  51  years 
among  U.S.  women.  Perimenopause  refers  to  the  time  period  preced-
ing  menopause,  when  fertility  wanes  and  menstrual  cycle  irregularity 
increases, until the first year after cessation of menses. The onset of peri-
menopause precedes the final menses by 2–8 years, with a mean duration 
of 4 years. Smoking accelerates the menopausal transition by 2 years.

Although  the  peri-  and  postmenopausal  transitions  share  many 
symptoms,  the  physiology  and  clinical  management  of  the  two  differ. 
Low-dose oral contraceptives have become a therapeutic mainstay in per-
imenopause, whereas postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) has been 
a common method of symptom alleviation after menstruation ceases.

PERIMENOPAUSE
 ■ PHYSIOLOGY
Ovarian mass and fertility decline sharply after age 35 and even more 
precipitously  during  perimenopause;  depletion  of  primary  follicles, 
a  process  that  begins  before  birth,  occurs  steadily  until  menopause 
(Chap.  392).  In  perimenopause,  intermenstrual  intervals  shorten 
significantly  (typically  by  3  days)  as  a  result  of  an  accelerated  follic-
ular phase. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels rise because of 
altered  folliculogenesis  and  reduced  inhibin  secretion.  In  contrast  to 
the consistently high FSH and low estradiol levels seen in menopause, 
perimenopause  is  characterized  by  “irregularly  irregular”  hormone 
levels.  The  propensity  for  anovulatory  cycles  can  produce  a  hyper- 
estrogenic, hypoprogestagenic environment that may account for the 
increased incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, uterine 
polyps,  and  leiomyoma  observed  among  women  of  perimenopausal 
age.  Mean  serum  levels  of  selected  ovarian  and  pituitary  hormones 
during the menopausal transition are shown in Fig. 395-1. With tran-
sition into menopause, estradiol levels fall markedly, whereas estrone 
levels are relatively preserved, a pattern reflecting peripheral aromati-
zation of adrenal and ovarian androgens. Levels of FSH increase more 
than those of luteinizing hormone, presumably because of the loss of 
inhibin as well as estrogen feedback.

 ■ DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
The Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop +10 (STRAW+10) classifi-
cation provides a comprehensive framework for the clinical assessment 
of  ovarian  aging.  As  shown  in  Fig.  395-2,  menstrual  cycle  charac-
teristics  are  the  principal  criteria  for  characterizing  the  menopausal 
transition,  with  biomarker  measures  as  supportive  criteria.  Because 
of  their  extreme  intraindividual  variability,  FSH  and  estradiol  levels 
are imperfect diagnostic indicators of perimenopause in menstruating 
women.  However,  a  consistently  low  FSH  level  in  the  early  follicular 
phase (days 2–5) of the menstrual cycle does not support a diagnosis 
of  perimenopause,  while  levels  >25  IU/L  in  a  random  blood  sample 
are characteristic of the late menopause transition. FSH measurement 
can  also  aid  in  assessing  fertility;  levels  of  <20  IU/L,  20  to  <30  IU/L, 
and ≥30 IU/L measured on day 3 of the cycle indicate a good, fair, and 
poor  likelihood  of  achieving  pregnancy,  respectively.  Anti-müllerian 
hormone and inhibin B may also be useful for assessing reproductive  
aging.

 ■ SYMPTOMS
Determining  whether  symptoms  that  develop  in  midlife  are  due  to 
ovarian senescence or to other age-related changes is difficult. There is 
strong evidence that the menopausal transition can cause hot flashes, 
night  sweats,  irregular  bleeding,  and  vaginal  dryness,  and  there  is 
moderate evidence that it can cause sleep disturbances in some women. 
There  is  inconclusive  or  insufficient  evidence  that  ovarian  aging  is  a 
major  cause  of  mood  swings,  depression,  impaired  memory  or  con-
centration,  somatic  symptoms,  urinary  incontinence,  or  sexual  dys-
function. In one U.S. study, nearly 60% of women reported hot flashes 
in the 2 years before their final menses. Symptom intensity, duration, 
frequency, and effects on quality of life are highly variable.

TREATMENT
Perimenopause

PERIMENOPAUSAL THERAPY
For  women  with  irregular  or  heavy  menses  or  hormone-related 
symptoms  that  impair  quality  of  life,  low-dose  combined  oral 
contraceptives are a staple of therapy. Static doses of estrogen and 
progestin  (e.g.,  20  μg  of  ethinyl  estradiol  and  1  mg  of  norethin-
drone  acetate  daily  for  21  days  each  month)  can  eliminate  vaso-
motor symptoms and restore regular cyclicity. Oral contraceptives 
provide  other  benefits,  including  protection  against  ovarian  and 
endometrial  cancers  and  increased  bone  density,  although  it  is 
not  clear  whether  use  during  perimenopause  decreases  fracture 
risk later in life. Moreover, the contraceptive benefit is important, 
given  that  the  unintentional  pregnancy  rate  among  women  in 
their  forties  rivals  that  of  adolescents.  Contraindications  to  oral 
contraceptive use include cigarette smoking, liver disease, a history

of  thromboembolism  or  cardiovascular  disease,  breast  cancer,  or 
unexplained  vaginal  bleeding.  Progestin-only  formulations  (e.g., 
0.35  mg  of  norethindrone  daily)  or  medroxyprogesterone  (Depo-
Provera) injections (e.g., 150 mg IM every 3 months) may provide 
an alternative for the treatment of perimenopausal menorrhagia in 
women  who  smoke  or  have  cardiovascular  risk  factors.  Although 
progestins  neither  regularize  cycles  nor  reduce  the  number  of 
bleeding days, they reduce the volume of menstrual flow.

Nonhormonal  strategies  to  reduce  menstrual  flow  include  the 
use  of  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  agents  such  as  mefenamic 
acid (an initial dose of 500 mg at the start of menses, then 250 mg 
qid  for  2–3  days)  or,  when  medical  approaches  fail,  endometrial 
ablation.  It  should  be  noted  that  menorrhagia  requires  an  evalu-
ation  to  rule  out  uterine  disorders.  Transvaginal  ultrasound  with 
saline enhancement is useful for detecting leiomyomata or polyps, 
and endometrial aspiration can identify hyperplastic changes. 
TRANSITION TO MENOPAUSE
For sexually active women using contraceptive hormones to alleviate 
perimenopausal  symptoms,  the  question  of  when  and  if  to  switch 
to HT must be individualized. Doses of estrogen and progestogen 
(either  synthetic  progestins  or  natural  forms  of  progesterone)  in 
HT are lower than those in oral contraceptives and have not been 
documented  to  prevent  pregnancy.  Although  a  1-year  absence  of 
spontaneous menses reliably indicates ovulation cessation, it is not 
possible  to  assess  the  natural  menstrual  pattern  while  a  woman  is 
taking an oral contraceptive. Women willing to switch to a barrier 
method  of  contraception  should  do  so;  if  menses  occur  spontane-
ously, oral contraceptive use can be resumed. The average age of final 
menses among relatives can serve as a guide for when to initiate this 
process, which can be repeated yearly until menopause has occurred.

MENOPAUSE AND POSTMENOPAUSAL HT
One of the most complex health care decisions facing women is whether 
to use postmenopausal HT. Once prescribed primarily to relieve vaso-
motor symptoms, HT has been promoted as a strategy to forestall var-
ious disorders that accelerate after menopause, including osteoporosis 
and  cardiovascular  disease.  In  2000,  nearly  40%  of  postmenopausal 
women aged 50–74 in the United States had used HT. This widespread 
use occurred despite the paucity of conclusive data, until recently, on 
the health consequences of such therapy. Although many women rely 
on their health care providers for a definitive answer to the question of 
whether to use postmenopausal hormones, balancing the benefits and 
risks for an individual patient is challenging.

Although  observational  studies  suggest  that  HT  prevents  cardio-
vascular and other chronic diseases, the apparent benefits may result 
at  least  in  part  from  differences  between  women  who  opt  to  take 
postmenopausal  hormones  and  women  who  do  not.  Those  choos-
ing  HT  tend  to  be  healthier,  have  greater  access  to  medical  care,  are 
more  compliant  with  prescribed  treatments,  and  maintain  a  more 
health-promoting  lifestyle.  Randomized  trials,  which  eliminate  these 
confounding  factors,  have  not  consistently  confirmed  the  benefits 
found in observational studies. Indeed, the largest HT trial to date, the 
Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), which examined >27,000 postmeno-
pausal women aged 50–79 (mean age, 63) for an average of 5–7 years, 
was stopped early because of an overall unfavorable benefit-risk ratio 
in  the  estrogen-progestin  arm  and  an  excess  risk  of  stroke  that  was 
not  offset  by  a  reduced  risk  of  coronary  heart  disease  (CHD)  in  the 
estrogen-only arm.

The following summary offers a decision-making guide based on a 
synthesis of currently available evidence. Prevention of cardiovascular 
disease is eliminated from the equation due to lack of evidence for such 
benefits in randomized clinical trials.

 ■ BENEFITS AND RISKS OF POSTMENOPAUSAL HT
See Table 395-1.

Definite Benefits  •  SYMPTOMS OF MENOPAUSE  Compelling evi-
dence, including data from randomized clinical trials, indicates that 
estrogen  therapy  is  highly  effective  for  controlling  vasomotor  and 
genitourinary symptoms. Alternative approaches, including the use 
of antidepressants (such as paroxetine, 10–25 mg/d; paroxetine salt, 
7.5 mg/d; or venlafaxine, 37.5–75 mg/d), γ-aminobutyric acid ana-
logues (such as gabapentin, 300 mg nightly, up to 900 mg in divided 
doses;  or  pregabalin,  75–150  mg/d  twice  per  day),  or  clonidine 
patch (0.1–0.3 mg weekly), may also alleviate vasomotor symptoms, 
although they are less effective than HT. Paroxetine is the only non-
hormonal drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
for  treatment  of  vasomotor  symptoms.  Bazedoxifene,  an  estrogen 
agonist/antagonist,  in  combination  with  conjugated  estrogens  has 
also received approval for this use. Cognitive behavioral therapy and 
clinical hypnosis have been shown in randomized trials to help with 
vasomotor  symptom  management.  Weight  loss,  mindfulness-based 
stress  reduction,  stellate  ganglion  block,  and  the  consumption  of 
S-equol soy derivatives are also promising strategies, although more 
trials  are  needed.  For  genitourinary  syndrome  of  menopause,  the 
efficacy of low-dose vaginal estrogen is similar to that of oral or trans-
dermal estrogen; oral ospemifene or vaginal prasterone are additional 
options.
OSTEOPOROSIS  (See also Chap. 411)
Bone density  By reducing bone turnover and resorption rates, estrogen 
slows the aging-related bone loss experienced by most postmenopausal 
women. More than 50 randomized trials have demonstrated that post-
menopausal estrogen therapy, with or without a progestogen, rapidly 
increases bone mineral density at the spine by 4–6% and at the hip by 
2–3% and that those increases are maintained during treatment.
Fractures  Data  from  observational  studies  indicate  a  50–80%  lower 
risk  of  vertebral  fracture  and  a  25–30%  lower  risk  of  hip,  wrist,  and 
other  peripheral  fractures  among  current  estrogen  users;  addition  of 
a  progestogen  does  not  appear  to  modify  this  benefit.  In  the  WHI, 
5–7  years  of  either  combined  estrogen-progestin  or  estrogen-only 
therapy  was  associated  with  a  33%  reduction  in  hip  fractures  and 
25–30%  fewer  total  fractures  among  a  population  unselected  for 
osteoporosis.  Bisphosphonates  (such  as  alendronate,  10  mg/d  or 
70  mg  once  per  week;  risedronate,  5  mg/d  or  35  mg  once  per  week; 
ibandronate,  2.5  mg/d  or  150  mg  once  per  month  or  3  mg  every  
3  months  IV;  or  zoledronic  acid,  5  mg  once  per  year  IV)  and  deno-
sumab  (60  mg  twice  per  year  SC)  increase  bone  mass  density  by 
reducing bone resorption and have been shown in randomized trials to 
decrease fracture rates. Other treatment options include bazedoxifene 
in combination with conjugated estrogens; the selective estrogen recep-
tor modulator (SERM) raloxifene (60 mg/d); and parathyroid hormone 
(teriparatide, 20 μg/d SC). Unlike estrogen, these alternative therapies 
do not appear to have adverse effects on the endometrium or breast. 
Increased  weight-bearing  and  resistance  exercise;  adequate  calcium 
intake (1000–1200 mg/d through diet or supplements in two or three 
divided doses); and adequate vitamin D intake (600–1000 IU/d) may 
also  reduce  the  risk  of  osteoporosis-related  fractures.  According  to  a 
2011 report by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy 
of  Medicine),  25-hydroxyvitamin  D  blood  levels  of  ≥50  nmol/L  are 
sufficient for bone-density maintenance and fracture prevention. The 
Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX®) score, an algorithm that combines 
an  individual’s  bone-density  score  with  age  and  other  risk  factors  to 
predict her 10-year risk of hip and major osteoporotic fracture, may be 
of use in guiding decisions about pharmacologic treatment (see https://
www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX/).
Definite  Risks  •  ENDOMETRIAL  CANCER  (WITH  ESTROGEN 
ALONE)  A  combined  analysis  of  30  observational  studies  found  a 
tripling of endometrial cancer risk among short-term users (1–5 years) 
of unopposed estrogen and a nearly tenfold increased risk among long-
term users (≥10 years). These findings are supported by results from 
the  randomized  Postmenopausal  Estrogen/Progestin  Interventions 

(PEPI) trial, in which 24% of women assigned to unopposed estrogen 
for  3  years  developed  atypical  endometrial  hyperplasia—a  premalig-
nant  lesion—as  opposed  to  only  1%  of  women  assigned  to  placebo. 
Use  of  a  progestogen,  which  opposes  the  effects  of  estrogen  on  the 
endometrium,  eliminates  these  risks  and  may  even  reduce  risk  (see 
later).
VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM  A meta-analysis of observational stud-
ies found that current oral estrogen use was associated with a 2.5-fold 
increase  in  risk  of  venous  thromboembolism  in  postmenopausal 
women.  A  meta-analysis  of  randomized  trials,  including  the  WHI, 
found a 2.1-fold increase in risk. Results from the WHI indicate a nearly 
twofold increase in risk of pulmonary embolism and deep-vein throm-
bosis with estrogen-progestin and a 35–50% increase in these risks with 
estrogen-only therapy. Transdermal estrogen, taken alone or with cer-
tain  progestogens  (micronized  progesterone  or  pregnane  derivatives), 
appears to be a safer alternative with respect to thrombotic risk.
BREAST CANCER (WITH ESTROGEN-PROGESTIN)  An increased risk of 
breast cancer has been found among current or recent estrogen users 
in observational studies; this risk is directly related to duration of use. 
In  a  meta-analysis  of  51  case-control  and  cohort  studies,  short-term 
use (<5 years) of postmenopausal HT did not appreciably elevate breast 
cancer incidence, whereas long-term use (≥5 years) was associated with 
a 35% increase in risk. In contrast to findings for endometrial cancer, 
combined estrogen-progestin regimens appear to increase breast can-
cer  risk  more  than  estrogen  alone.  Data  from  randomized  trials  also 
indicate that estrogen-progestin raises breast cancer risk. In the WHI, 
women  assigned  to  receive  combination  hormones  for  an  average  of 
5.6 years were 24% more likely to develop breast cancer than women 
assigned  to  placebo,  but  7.1  years  of  estrogen-only  therapy  did  not 
increase risk. Indeed, the WHI showed a trend toward a reduction in 
breast cancer risk with estrogen alone, although it is unclear whether 
this  finding  would  pertain  to  formulations  of  estrogen  other  than 
conjugated equine estrogens or to treatment durations of >7 years. In 
the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), combi-
nation therapy for 4 years was associated with a 27% increase in breast 
cancer risk. Although the latter finding was not statistically significant, 
the totality of evidence strongly implicates estrogen-progestin therapy 
in breast carcinogenesis.

Some  observational  data  suggest  that  the  length  of  the  interval 
between menopause onset and HT initiation may influence the asso-
ciation between such therapy and breast cancer risk, with a “gap time” 
of  <3–5  years  conferring  a  higher  HT-associated  breast  cancer  risk. 
(This  pattern  of  findings  contrasts  with  that  for  CHD,  as  discussed 
later  in  this  chapter.)  However,  this  association  remains  inconclusive 
and may be a spurious finding attributable to higher rates of screening 
mammography and thus earlier cancer detection in HT users than in 
nonusers, especially in early menopause. Indeed, in the WHI trial, haz-
ard ratios for HT and breast cancer risk did not differ among women 
50–59, those 60–69, and those 70–79 years of age at trial entry. (There 
was  insufficient  power  to  examine  finer  age  categories.)  Additional 
research is needed to clarify the issue.

GALLBLADDER  DISEASE  Large  observational  studies  report  a  two- 
to  threefold  increased  risk  of  gallstones  or  cholecystectomy  among 
postmenopausal  women  taking  oral  estrogen.  In  the  WHI,  women 
randomized to estrogen-progestin or estrogen alone were ~55% more 
likely  to  develop  gallbladder  disease  than  those  assigned  to  placebo. 
Risks were also increased in HERS. Transdermal HT might be a safer 
alternative, but further research is needed.

Probable or Uncertain Risks and Benefits  •  CORONARY HEART 
DISEASE/STROKE  Until  recently,  HT  had  been  enthusiastically  rec-
ommended  as  a  possible  cardioprotective  agent.  In  the  past  three 
decades, multiple observational studies suggested, in the aggregate, that 
estrogen  use  leads  to  a  35–50%  reduction  in  CHD  incidence  among 
postmenopausal  women.  The  biologic  plausibility  of  such  an  associ-
ation  is  supported  by  data  from  randomized  trials  demonstrating 
that exogenous estrogen lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol levels and raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol

aThe estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI assessed 5.6 years of conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d) versus placebo. The

was not designed to assess the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on menopausal symptoms. Data from other randomized trials suggest that HT reduces risk for menopausal 
symptoms by 65–90%. dCoronary heart disease is defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary death. eThere was a significant interaction by age; that is, the 
association between HT and the specified outcome was different in younger women and older women. fThis is the risk reduction that was observed during a cumulative 
13-year follow-up period (5.6 years of treatment plus 8.2 years of postintervention observation). gThe global index is a composite outcome representing the first event for 
each participant from among the following: coronary heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer (estrogen-progestin 
arm only), hip fracture, and death. Because participants can experience more than one type of event, the global index cannot be derived by a simple summing of the 
component events. hIncludes some outcomes where results were divergent between the estrogen-progestin arm and the estrogen-alone arm.

levels  by  10–15%.  Administration  of  estrogen  also  favorably  affects 
lipoprotein(a)  levels,  LDL  oxidation,  endothelial  vascular  function, 
fibrinogen,  and  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor  1.  However,  estrogen 
therapy has unfavorable effects on other biomarkers of cardiovascular 
risk:  it  boosts  triglyceride  levels;  promotes  coagulation  via  factor  VII, 
prothrombin fragments 1 and 2, and fibrinopeptide A elevations; and 
raises levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein.

Randomized  trials  of  estrogen  or  combined  estrogen-progestin 
in  women  with  preexisting  cardiovascular  disease  have  not  con-
firmed  the  benefits  reported  in  observational  studies.  In  HERS  (a 
secondary-prevention  trial  designed  to  test  the  efficacy  and  safety 
of  estrogen-progestin  therapy  with  regard  to  clinical  cardiovascu-
lar  outcomes),  the  4-year  incidence  of  coronary  death  and  nonfatal 
myocardial infarction was similar in the active-treatment and placebo 
groups, and a 50% increase in risk of coronary events was noted dur-
ing the first year among participants assigned to the active-treatment 
group.  Although  it  is  possible  that  progestin  may  mitigate  estrogen’s 
benefits,  the  Estrogen  Replacement  and  Atherosclerosis  (ERA)  trial 
indicated  that  angiographically  determined  progression  of  coronary 
atherosclerosis was unaffected by either opposed or unopposed estro-
gen treatment. Moreover, no cardiovascular benefit was found in the 
Papworth  Hormone  Replacement  Therapy  Atherosclerosis  Study,  a 
trial  of  transdermal  estradiol  with  and  without  norethindrone;  the 
Women’s Estrogen for Stroke Trial (WEST), a trial of oral 17β-estradiol; 
or the Estrogen in the Prevention of Reinfarction Trial (ESPRIT), a trial 
of  oral  estradiol  valerate.  Thus,  in  clinical  trials,  HT  has  not  proved 
effective  for  the  secondary  prevention  of  cardiovascular  disease  in 
postmenopausal women.

Primary-prevention trials also suggest an early increase in cardio-
vascular risk and an absence of cardioprotection with postmenopausal 
HT.  In  the  WHI,  women  assigned  to  5.6  years  of  estrogen-progestin 
therapy  were  18%  more  likely  to  develop  CHD  (defined  in  primary 
analyses  as  nonfatal  myocardial  infarction  or  coronary  death)  than 
those assigned to placebo, although this risk elevation was not statis-
tically  significant.  However,  during  the  trial’s  first  year,  there  was  a 
significant 80% increase in risk, which diminished in subsequent years 
(p for trend by time = .03). In the estrogen-only arm of the WHI, no 
overall effect on CHD was observed during the 7.1 years of the trial or 
in any specific year of follow-up. This pattern of results was similar to 
that for the outcome of total myocardial infarction.

However,  a  closer  look  at  available  data  suggests  that  timing  of 
initiation of HT may critically influence the association between such 
therapy and CHD. Estrogen may slow early stages of atherosclerosis but 
have  adverse  effects  on  advanced  atherosclerotic  lesions.  It  has  been 
hypothesized  that  the  prothrombotic  and  proinflammatory  effects 
of  estrogen  manifest  themselves  predominantly  among  women  with 
subclinical  lesions  who  initiate  HT  well  after  the  menopausal  transi-
tion, whereas women with less arterial damage who start HT early in 
menopause  may  derive  cardiovascular  benefit  because  they  have  not 
yet developed advanced lesions. Data from experiments in nonhuman 
primates and from some recent randomized trials in humans support 
this  concept.  Conjugated  estrogens  had  no  effect  on  the  extent  of 
coronary  artery  plaque  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  assigned  to  receive 
estrogen alone or combined with progestin starting 2 years (~6 years 
in human terms) after oophorectomy and well after the establishment 
of  atherosclerosis.  However,  administration  of  exogenous  hormones 
immediately  after  oophorectomy,  during  the  early  stages  of  athero-
sclerosis,  reduced  the  extent  of  plaque  by  70%.  In  the  Early  versus 
Late  Intervention  Trial  with  Estradiol  (ELITE),  a  6-year  trial  among 
643 healthy postmenopausal women that was designed to test whether 
effects  of  estrogen  on  the  development  and  progression  of  athero-
sclerosis  depend  on  age  at  initiation  of  therapy,  oral  17β-estradiol 
administered  with  or  without  vaginal  micronized  progesterone  sig-
nificantly slowed carotid atherosclerotic progression in women within 
6 years of menopause onset (mean age, 55.4 years) but not in women  
>10 years past menopause onset (mean age, 65.4 years) (p for interac-
tion = .007). On the other hand, in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention 
Study  (KEEPS),  a  4-year  trial  among  729  healthy  postmenopausal 
women  within  3  years  of  menopause  onset  at  trial  entry  (mean  age, 

53 years), neither oral conjugated estrogens nor transdermal estradiol, 
administered with oral micronized progesterone, affected carotid ath-
erosclerotic progression. However, the low prevalence of this endpoint 
in the overall study population may have curtailed power to detect a 
treatment difference.

Lending  further  credence  to  the  timing  hypothesis  are  results  of 
subgroup analyses of data from observational studies and large clinical 
trials. For example, among women who entered the WHI trial with a 
relatively  favorable  cholesterol  profile,  estrogen  with  or  without  pro-
gestin led to a 40% lower risk of incident CHD. Among women who 
entered  with  a  worse  cholesterol  profile,  therapy  resulted  in  a  73% 
higher  risk  (p  for  interaction  =  .02).  The  presence  or  absence  of  the 
metabolic syndrome (Chap. 408) also strongly influenced the relation 
between  HT  and  incident  CHD.  Among  women  with  the  metabolic 
syndrome,  HT  more  than  doubled  CHD  risk,  whereas  no  associa-
tion  was  observed  among  women  without  the  syndrome.  Moreover, 
although there was no association between estrogen-only therapy and 
CHD in the WHI trial cohort as a whole, such therapy was associated 
with a CHD risk reduction of 40% among participants aged 50–59; in 
contrast, a risk reduction of only 5% was observed among those aged 
60–69, and a risk increase of 9% was found among those aged 70–79 (p 
for trend by age = .08). For the outcome of total myocardial infarction, 
estrogen alone was associated with a borderline-significant 45% reduc-
tion and a nonsignificant 24% increase in risk among the youngest and 
oldest  women,  respectively  (p  for  trend  by  age  =  .02).  Estrogen  was 
also  associated  with  lower  levels  of  coronary  artery  calcified  plaque 
in the younger age group. Although age did not have a similar effect 
in the estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI, CHD risks increased with 
years since menopause (p for trend = .08), with a significantly elevated 
risk among women who were ≥20 years past menopause. For the out-
come of total myocardial infarction, estrogen-progestin was associated 
with  a  9%  risk  reduction  among  women  <10  years  past  menopause 
as opposed to a 16% increase in risk among women 10–19 years past 
menopause  and  a  twofold  increase  in  risk  among  women  >20  years 
past menopause (p for trend = .01). In the large observational Nurses’ 
Health Study, women who chose to start HT within 4 years of meno-
pause  experienced  a  lower  risk  of  CHD  than  did  nonusers,  whereas 
those  who  began  therapy  ≥10  years  after  menopause  appeared  to 
receive  little  coronary  benefit.  Observational  studies  include  a  high 
proportion of women who begin HT within 3–4 years of menopause, 
whereas clinical trials include a high proportion of women ≥12 years 
past menopause; this difference helps to reconcile some of the apparent 
discrepancies between the two types of studies.

For  the  outcome  of  stroke,  WHI  participants  assigned  to  estrogen- 
progestin  or  estrogen  alone  were  ~35%  more  likely  to  suffer  a  stroke 
than  those  assigned  to  placebo.  Whether  or  not  age  at  initiation  of 
HT influences stroke risk is not well understood. In the WHI and the 
Nurses’ Health Study, HT was associated with an excess risk of stroke in 
all age groups. Further research is needed on age, time since menopause, 
and other individual characteristics (including biomarkers) that predict 
increases  or  decreases  in  cardiovascular  risk  associated  with  exoge-
nous  HT.  Furthermore,  it  remains  uncertain  whether  different  doses, 
formulations, or routes of administration of HT will produce different 
cardiovascular effects.

COLORECTAL  CANCER  Observational  studies  have  suggested  that 
HT  reduces  risks  of  colon  and  rectal  cancer,  although  the  estimated 
magnitudes of the relative benefits have ranged from 8 to 34% in var-
ious  meta-analyses.  In  the  WHI  (the  sole  trial  to  examine  the  issue),  
estrogen-progestin was associated with a significant 38% reduction in 
colorectal cancer over a 5.6-year period, although no benefit was seen 
with 7 years of estrogen-only therapy. However, a modifying effect of 
age  was  observed,  with  a  doubling  of  risk  with  HT  in  women  aged 
70–79 but no risk elevation in younger women (p for trend by age = .02).

COGNITIVE  DECLINE  AND  DEMENTIA  A  meta-analysis  of  10  case- 
control  and  two  cohort  studies  suggested  that  postmenopausal  HT  is 
associated with a 34% decreased risk of dementia. Subsequent random-
ized trials (including the WHI), however, have failed to demonstrate any 
benefit of estrogen or estrogen-progestin therapy on the progression of

mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease and/or have indicated a potential 
adverse effect of HT on the incidence of dementia, at least in women 
≥65  years  of  age.  Among  women  randomized  to  HT  (as  opposed  to 
placebo) at age 50–55 in the WHI, no effect on cognition was observed 
during the postintervention phase. Determining whether timing of ini-
tiation of HT influences cognitive outcomes will require further study.
OVARIAN  CANCER  AND  OTHER  DISORDERS  On  the  basis  of  limited 
observational  and  randomized  data,  it  has  been  hypothesized  that 
HT increases the risk of ovarian cancer and reduces the risk of type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Results from the WHI support these hypotheses. The 
WHI also found that HT use was associated with an increased risk of 
urinary incontinence and that estrogen-progestin was associated with 
increased rates of lung cancer mortality.
ENDOMETRIAL CANCER (WITH ESTROGEN-PROGESTIN)  In the WHI, 
use  of  estrogen-progestin  was  associated  with  a  nonsignificant  17% 
reduction in risk of endometrial cancer. A significant reduction in risk 
emerged during the postintervention period (see later).
ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY  In the overall WHI cohort, estrogen with or 
without  progestin  was  not  associated  with  all-cause  mortality.  How-
ever, there was a trend toward reduced mortality in younger women, 
particularly with estrogen alone. For women aged 50–59, 60–69, and 
70–79 years, relative risks (RRs) associated with estrogen-only therapy 
were 0.70, 1.01, and 1.21, respectively (p for trend = .04).

OVERALL  BENEFIT-RISK  PROFILE  Estrogen-progestin  was  associ-
ated  with  an  unfavorable  benefit-risk  profile  (excluding  relief  from 
menopausal  symptoms)  as  measured  by  a  “global  index”—a  com-
posite  outcome  including  CHD,  stroke,  pulmonary  embolism,  breast 
cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, hip fracture, and death 
(Table 395-1)—in the WHI cohort as a whole, and this association did 
not vary by 10-year age group. Estrogen-only therapy was associated 
with a neutral benefit-risk profile in the WHI cohort as a whole. How-
ever, there was a significant trend toward a more favorable benefit-risk 
profile among younger women and a less favorable profile among older 
women, with RRs of 0.84, 0.99, and 1.17 for women aged 50–59, 60–69, 
and 70–79 years, respectively (p for trend by age = .02). The balance 
of  benefits  and  risks  of  estrogen  with  and  without  progestin  among 
women aged 50–59 is shown in Fig. 395-3.
CHANGES IN HEALTH STATUS AFTER DISCONTINUATION OF HT  In the 
WHI, many but not all risks and benefits associated with active use of 
HT  dissipated  within  5–7  years  after  discontinuation  of  therapy.  For 
estrogen-progestin,  an  elevated  risk  of  breast  cancer  persisted  (RR  = 
1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11–1.48) during a median cumu-

95% CI, 0.68–0.97), and a significant reduction in endometrial cancer 
risk  emerged  (RR  =  0.67;  95%  CI,  0.49–0.91).  For  estrogen  alone,

the  reduction  in  breast  cancer  risk  became  statistically  significant 
(RR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65–0.97) during a median cumulative 13-year  
follow-up period (6.8 years of treatment plus 6.6 years of postinterven-
tion  observation),  and  significant  differences  by  age  group  persisted 
for total myocardial infarction and the global index, with more favor-
able results for younger women. During a median cumulative 18-year 
follow-up, estrogen alone was associated with a significant reduction 
in all-cause mortality in women aged 50–59 years (RR = 0.79; 95% CI, 
0.64–0.96); the protective effect was seen primarily in those with bilateral 
oophorectomy (RR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.96).

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Postmenopausal HT

The  rational  use  of  postmenopausal  HT  requires  balancing  the 
potential  benefits  and  risks.  Table  395-2  provides  one  approach 
to decision-making. This approach applies to women with meno-
pausal symptoms who are age 45 years and older or to women who 
have had removal of both ovaries, regardless of age. Women below 
age 45 years or those with uncertain menopausal status may need 
additional  clinical  evaluation  before  determining  a  management 
plan. The clinician should first assess whether the patient has mod-
erate to severe hot flashes and/or night sweats—the primary indica-
tion for initiation of systemic HT—that do not subside in response 
to behavioral/lifestyle modifications. (A patient handout with sug-
gested  lifestyle  modifications  can  be  found  at  http://www.meno-
pause.org/docs/for-women/mnflashes.pdf.) Systemic HT may also be 
used to prevent osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture who

cannot tolerate alternative osteoporosis therapies. (Vaginal estrogen 
or other medications may be used to treat genitourinary syndrome 
of menopause in the absence of vasomotor symptoms [see below].) 
The benefits and risks of such therapy should be reviewed with the 
patient, giving more emphasis to absolute than to relative measures 
of effect and pointing out uncertainties in clinical knowledge where 
relevant. Because chronic disease rates generally increase with age, 
absolute risks tend to be greater in older women, even when RRs 
remain  similar.  Potential  side  effects—especially  vaginal  bleeding 
that may result from use of the combined estrogen-progestogen for-
mulations recommended for women with an intact uterus—should 
be noted. The patient’s own preference regarding therapy should be 
elicited and factored into the decision. Contraindications should be 
assessed routinely and include unexplained vaginal bleeding; liver 
dysfunction  or  disease;  venous  thromboembolism;  known  blood 
clotting  disorder  or  thrombophilia  (transdermal  estrogen  may  be 
an option); untreated hypertension; history of endometrial cancer 
(except stage 1 without deep invasion), breast cancer, or other estrogen- 
dependent cancer; and history of CHD, stroke, or transient ische-
mic  attack.  Relative  contraindications  to  systemic  HT  include  an 
elevated risk of breast cancer (e.g., women who have one or more 
first-degree relatives with breast cancer, susceptibility genes such as 
BRCA1 or BRCA2, a personal history of cellular atypia detected by 
breast biopsy); hypertriglyceridemia (>400 mg/dL); an elevated risk 
of cardiovascular disease; and active gallbladder disease (transder-
mal estrogen may be an option in the latter three cases because it 
has a less adverse effect on triglyceride levels, clotting factors, and 
inflammation  factors  than  oral  HT).  Primary  prevention  of  heart 
disease should not be viewed as an expected benefit of HT, and an 
increase in the risk of stroke as well as a small early increase in the 
risk of coronary artery disease should be considered. Nevertheless, 
such  therapy  may  be  appropriate  if  the  noncoronary  benefits  of 
treatment  clearly  outweigh  the  risks.  Reassess  benefits  and  risks 
at least once every 6–12 months, assuming the patient’s continued 
preference for HT, or if the patient’s health status changes. A woman 
who  suffers  an  acute  coronary  event  or  stroke  while  taking  HT 
should discontinue therapy immediately.

Many  options  for  systemic  HT  are  available.  Estrogen  alone  is 
recommended  for  women  with  hysterectomy,  whereas  estrogen 
plus  progestogen  is  recommended  for  women  with  a  uterus.  In 
the  United  States,  the  most  commonly  prescribed  oral  estrogens 
for  systemic  treatment  of  vasomotor  symptoms  are  17β-estradiol 
(1.0 or 0.5 mg/d or other doses) and conjugated equine estrogens 
(CEE; 0.625, 0.45, or 0.3 mg/d or other doses). The most commonly 
prescribed  transdermal  estrogen  products  are  17β-estradiol  skin 
patches (0.035 or 0.05 mg/d or other doses). The most commonly 
prescribed  progestogens  are  medroxyprogesterone  acetate  (MPA; 
2.5, 5, or 10 mg/d) and micronized progesterone (100 or 200 mg/d). 
Also  available  are  oral  estrogen-progestin  combinations,  such  as 
oral  CEE  and  MPA,  oral  17β-estradiol  or  ethinyl  estradiol  with 
norethindrone acetate, oral estradiol with progesterone, and other 
options.  CEE/bazedoxifene  may  be  an  option  for  women  with  a 
uterus,  especially  those  with  concerns  about  breast  tenderness, 
breast density, or uterine bleeding. Contraindications to CEE/baze-
doxifene are similar to those for systemic HT.

Short-term use (<5 years for estrogen-progestogen and <7 years 
for  estrogen  alone)  is  appropriate  for  relief  of  menopausal  symp-
toms among women without contraindications to such use. How-
ever,  such  therapy  should  be  avoided  by  women  with  an  elevated 
baseline risk of future cardiovascular events. Women who have con-
traindications for or are opposed to HT may derive benefit from the 
use of certain antidepressants (including venlafaxine, fluoxetine, or 
paroxetine), gabapentin or pregabalin, or clonidine.

Long-term use (≥5 years for estrogen-progestogen and ≥7 years for 
estrogen alone) is more problematic because a heightened risk of breast 
cancer  must  be  factored  into  the  decision,  especially  for  estrogen- 
progestogen. Reasonable candidates for such use include postmeno-
pausal  women  who  have  persistent  severe  vasomotor  symptoms

along with an increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g., those with osteope-
nia, a personal or family history of nontraumatic fracture, or a weight 
<125 lb), who also have no personal or family history of breast cancer 
in a first-degree relative or other contraindications, and who have a 
strong personal preference for therapy. Poor candidates are women 
with  elevated  cardiovascular  risk,  those  at  increased  risk  of  breast 
cancer,  and  those  at  low  risk  of  osteoporosis.  Even  for  reasonable 
candidates, strategies to minimize dose and duration of use should be 
employed. For example, women using HT to relieve intense vasomo-
tor symptoms in early postmenopause should consider discontinuing 
therapy  within  5  years,  resuming  it  only  if  such  symptoms  persist. 
Because of the role of progestogens in increasing breast cancer risk, 
regimens  that  employ  cyclic  rather  than  continuous  progestogen 
exposure  as  well  as  formulations  other  than  MPA  should  be  con-
sidered  if  treatment  is  extended.  For  prevention  of  osteoporosis, 
alternative  therapies  such  as  bisphosphonates  or  SERMs  should  be 
considered.  Research  on  alternative  progestogens  and  androgen-
containing  preparations  has  been  limited,  particularly  with  respect 
to long-term safety. Additional research on the effects of these agents 
on cardiovascular disease, glucose tolerance, and breast cancer will be 
of particular interest.

For genitourinary symptoms such as vaginal dryness or pain with 
intercourse/sexual activity, intravaginal estrogen creams, tablets, or 
rings;  prasterone  (vaginal  dehydroepiandrosterone);  and  ospem-
ifene  are  options.  Contraindications  to  low-dose  vaginal  estrogen 
include unexplained vaginal bleeding or breast cancer, endometrial 
cancer,  or  other  estrogen-dependent  cancer.  Contraindications  to 
ospemifene  and  prasterone  are  the  same  as  those  for  low-dose 
vaginal estrogen, and contraindications for ospemifene additionally 
include venous or arterial thromboembolic disease, severe liver dis-
ease, and use of estrogens or estrogen agonists-antagonists.

In addition to HT, lifestyle choices such as smoking abstention, 
adequate physical activity, and a healthy diet can play a role in con-
trolling  symptoms  and  preventing  chronic  disease.  An  expanding 
array of pharmacologic options (e.g., bisphosphonates, SERMs, and 
other  agents  for  osteoporosis;  cholesterol-lowering  or  antihyper-
tensive  agents  for  cardiovascular  disease)  should  also  reduce  the 
widespread reliance on hormone use. However, short-term HT may 
still benefit some women.

396 Infertility and  
Contraception
Anuja Dokras, Janet E. Hall

INFERTILITY
The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  categorizes  infertility  as  a 
disease  of  the  reproductive  system.  Infertility  is  the  third  most  com-
mon  disease  worldwide,  affecting  ~48  million  couples.  It  is  defined 
as the inability to achieve a pregnancy over 12 months of unprotected 
intercourse. The prevalence of infertility, ~15% globally, has remained 
relatively stable over the past few decades. Primary infertility occurs 
in couples who have never achieved a pregnancy, whereas secondary 
infertility  refers  to  infertility  after  achieving  at  least  one  pregnancy. 
During the first year of attempting pregnancy, the fecundability rate, 
defined  as  the  ability  to  achieve  a  pregnancy  within  one  menstrual 
cycle,  is  highest  in  the  first  3  months  and  declines  over  the  next 
9 months. Approximately 85% of couples will achieve pregnancy after 
12 months, and 95% will achieve pregnancy after 24 months. Increasing 
trends  toward  later  childbearing  can  have  significant  implications 
due to age-related decrease in the fecundability rate. Compared to 
women  aged  30–31  years  of  age,  fecundability  is  reduced  by  14% 
in women aged 34–35 years, 19% in women aged 36–37 years, 53% 
in women aged 40–41 years, and 59% in women aged 42–44 years.

 ■ ETIOLOGY
The causes for infertility are generally classified as female, male, and 
unexplained (Fig. 396-1). The female causes include tubal factors (pel-
vic inflammatory disease, salpingitis isthmica nodosum, endometrio-
sis, prior surgery), uterine etiology (congenital malformations, fibroids, 
uterine  scarring),  ovulatory  dysfunction  (polycystic  ovary  syndrome 
[PCOS], diminished ovarian reserve, premature ovarian insufficiency), 
and  endocrine  dysfunction  (hypothyroidism,  hyperprolactinemia). 
Although the probability of achieving a pregnancy decreases after the 
age of 35 in women, primarily due to chromosomal abnormalities in 
the oocyte during meiosis, a similar decline has not been observed in 
men  aged  <50  years.  The  male  causes  of  infertility  include  anatomic 
factors  in  the  reproductive  system  (vasectomy,  infection,  absence  of 
the  vas),  endocrine  factors  (hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism,  hypo-
thyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, morbid obesity, medications), sexual 
dysfunction (erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction, decreased libido), and 
genetic factors contributing to primary testicular dysfunction, includ-
ing defects in spermatogenesis (Klinefelter’s syndrome, Y chromosome 
microdeletions). The distribution of these causes varies significantly in 
couples across the world. Overall, female factors are present in 30–40% 
of couples with infertility, male factors are present in 40–50%, and both 
male and female factors are identified in 20–30%. Unexplained infertil-
ity refers to the absence of any identified abnormality after completing 
the  fertility  workup  and  occurs  in  10–15%  of  couples.  As  a  result,  a 
complete workup of both partners is recommended in all couples pre-
senting with infertility.

 ■ FERTILITY EVALUATION
Diagnostic  evaluation  for  infertility  is  typically  initiated  after  1  year 
of  unprotected  intercourse  because  80–85%  of  couples  will  achieve 
a  pregnancy  over  this  time  period.  Evaluation  of  the  couple  can  be 
initiated  even  prior  to  meeting  the  definition  of  infertility,  especially 
if  they  have  risk  factors  for  infertility.  If  the  female  partner’s  age  is 
>35 years, it is recommended to initiate evaluation after 6 months of 
attempting pregnancy. If the age of the female partner is >40 years, it 
is recommended to start evaluating the couple immediately. The initial 
evaluation should include detailed medical history, laboratory testing, 
and preconception counseling for both partners. As multiple causes for 
infertility may be identified, it is best to perform the complete diagnos-
tic evaluation prior to initiating treatment.

History  and  Physical  Exam  A  detailed  history  obtained  from 
both  partners  is  essential  to  identify  risk  factors  for  infertility.  In 
the  female  partner,  gynecologic  history  (menstrual  frequency,  men-
orrhagia,  dysmenorrhea,  history  of  sexually  transmitted  infections, 
endometriosis),  medical  and  endocrine  history,  exposure  to  pelvic 
radiation, abdominal or pelvic surgeries, tobacco and alcohol use, med-
ication  use  including  cytotoxic  drugs,  family  history  of  early  meno-
pause, and prior history of pregnancy should be assessed. In addition, 
frequency  of  intercourse,  timing  of  intercourse,  use  of  methods  to 
detect ovulation, and concerns regarding sexual dysfunction over the 
past several months should be ascertained. Physical exam in the female 
partner should include assessment of weight and blood pressure (BP), 
thyroid  and  breast  exam,  assessment  for  signs  of  hyperandrogenism, 
and  pelvic  exam  to  assess  uterine  size,  adnexal  masses,  and  factors 
that might impact intercourse. Similarly, a detailed history should be 
obtained in the male partner with specific questions regarding injuries 
and surgery in the male reproductive tract; mumps orchitis; exposure 
to pelvic radiation; use of androgens, cytotoxic drugs, and other medi-
cations; and fertility with any prior partner. The exam in the male part-
ner should include body mass index (BMI), BP, and complete physical 
exam including testicular exam.

Ultrasound  An  abdominal  and  transvaginal  pelvic  ultrasound 
can  assess  uterine  (myomas,  adenomyosis,  müllerian  anomalies)  and 
adnexal  abnormalities  (endometriosis,  polycystic-appearing  ovaries) 
and  evaluate  ovarian  reserve  (number  of  antral  follicles  in  both 
ovaries).

Ovulation  Assessment  Women  who  have  regular  menstrual 
cycles  between  25  and  35  days  will  typically  have  ovulatory  cycles. 
Ovulation can be assessed by using ovulation detection strips at home 
to detect urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) or by measuring a serum 
progesterone level 7 days after ovulation. Basal body temperatures can 
also be used to confirm ovulation when a rise in temperature is noted 
in  the  luteal  phase.  However,  basal  body  temperature  measurements 
are less reliable than the above methods.

Hysterosalpingogram  An  hysterosalpingogram  (HSG)  is  per-
formed  during  the  follicular  phase  to  assess  the  patency  of  fallopian 
tubes  by  injecting  radiopaque  contrast  through  the  cervix  into  the 
uterus and imaging the flow of contrast through one or both tubes. In 
addition to identifying tubal pathology, an HSG may identify intrauter-
ine abnormalities such as polyps, submucosal myomas, and adhesions. 
Although the negative predictive value of HSG for assessing tubal pat-
ency is high, the positive predictive value is relatively low. Interestingly, 
pregnancy rates have been shown to be higher in women after an HSG 
test compared to those who did not have the test, likely related to tubal 
flushing. Alternate options that are increasingly used include injection of 

agitated saline contrast through the cervix into the uterus. Tubal patency 
is assessed by demonstrating passage of agitated saline contrast through 
the tubes or accumulation in the cul de sac as visualized by ultrasonog-
raphy. A saline infusion sonogram is more accurate in assessing intra-
uterine  pathology  such  as  polyps  and  intrauterine  scarring  compared 
to HSG and can be combined with ultrasound assessment of the pelvis.

Ovarian  Reserve  Evaluation  Assessment  of  ovarian  reserve 
includes  measurement  of  serum  FSH  and  estradiol  on  day  2  or  3  of 
the  menstrual  cycle  and  serum  anti-müllerian  hormone  (AMH). 
These  screening  tests  combined  with  age  of  the  female  partner  and 
antral follicle counts measured by ultrasound can identify diminished 
ovarian  reserve  and  provide  information  on  the  urgency  to  initiate 
treatment. AMH and antral follicle counts are also used to determine 
starting doses of gonadotropins for fertility treatments. These markers 
of ovarian reserve, however, do not predict the likelihood of pregnancy 
and live birth.

Endocrine  Tests 
In  women  with  irregular  menses,  serum  TSH, 
prolactin, and androgens should be measured to identify other causes 
for anovulation.

Semen Analysis (see Chap. 391)  The semen sample is collected 
after  2–7  days  of  abstinence  and  provides  an  assessment  of  sperm 
count, motility, morphology, volume, and pH. Although there is sig-
nificant overlap between semen parameters of fertile and infertile men, 
those  with  abnormal  sperm  parameters  based  on  the  WHO  criteria 
(oligoasthenozoospermia  is  defined  as  sperm  counts  <15  million/mL, 
motility <40%, and normal morphology <4%) should have a physical 
exam  and  further  endocrine  (serum  follicle-stimulating  hormone 
[FSH],  LH,  prolactin,  and  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  [TSH])  and 
genetic evaluation (karyotype and Y chromosome microdeletion).

Genetic  Screening  All  couples  can  be  offered  preconception 
genetic screening based on ethnicity, family history, or common auto-
somal recessive conditions.

Of note, diagnostic laparoscopy, postcoital test, endometrial biopsy, 
thrombophilia, and immunologic testing and karyotype are not indi-
cated as part of the initial workup of infertility.

 ■ COUNSELING AND TREATMENT
Preconception  Counseling  All  patients  seeking  fertility  care 
should  be  provided  with  preconception  counseling.  This  includes 
counseling about eating disorders or lifestyle modifications for weight 
management  as  obesity  in  women  is  associated  with  an  increase  in 
anovulatory cycles, miscarriage rates, and maternal and fetal complica-
tions in pregnancy. Obesity in men is associated with abnormal sperm 
parameters. Preconception counseling regarding smoking cessation is 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   3051

20/01/22   3:23 PM

 
 
 
 
3052 important as there is evidence to suggest that smoking cessation can 
reverse  the  detrimental  impact  of  smoking  on  fecundity.  Smoking 
decreases  fertility  rates  by  a  direct  impact  on  oocyte  DNA  and  also 
increases  the  risk  of  miscarriage  and  ectopic  pregnancy.  In  addi-
tion,  smoking  during  pregnancy  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk 
of  placental  abruption  and  intrauterine  growth  restriction  (IUGR). 
Moreover, the impact of smoking on ovarian reserve has been shown 
to  accelerate  the  time  to  menopause  by  1–4  years.  As  high  levels  of 
caffeine  consumption  increase  the  risk  of  infertility  and  miscarriage 
rates,  women  should  be  counseled  to  restrict  caffeine  consumption 
to  ≤2  cups  while  attempting  pregnancy  and  during  pregnancy.  Use 
of  testosterone  products,  which  are  widely  used  for  the  treatment  of 
hypoandrogenism and sexual dysfunction in men, should be stopped. 
Inquiries should be made about possible misuse of androgens for phys-
ical appearance or performance enhancement (Chap. 399). As part of 
the  preconception  counseling,  patients  should  be  informed  that  the 
fertile window is typically 5–6 days prior to ovulation, and therefore, 
intercourse  every  1–2  days  during  this  time  period  will  increase  the 
chance  of  pregnancy.  Various  methods  are  used  by  women  to  detect 
ovulation,  including  basal  body  temperature  measurements,  assess-
ment of changes in cervical mucus, and urinary LH kits. A rise in basal 
body temperatures indicates that ovulation has occurred and therefore 
cannot be used to time intercourse. LH kits can be used to detect the 
start of ovulation and subsequently time intercourse on the day of the 
LH surge and the following day.

Treatment  Treatment  recommendations  depend  on  the  results  of 
the fertility evaluation described above (Table 396-1). The success of 
different  treatments  depends  on  several  factors  including  age  of  the 
female  partner,  assessment  of  ovarian  reserve,  history  of  smoking, 
BMI, and race.

Tubal  Factor  Infertility  Tubal  factor  infertility  constitutes 
30–35% of cases of female infertility, and a large majority are secondary 
to tubal obstruction resulting from STIs. In vitro fertilization (IVF) was 
first developed as a treatment for tubal factor infertility as it bypasses 
the fallopian tubes and allows fertilization of oocytes in the laboratory 
prior  to  transfer  into  the  uterus.  IVF  offers  the  highest  success  rates 
for couples with tubal factor infertility. Tubal repair or reconstruction 
is  not  recommended  in  most  cases  associated  with  underlying  tubal 
infections or hydrosalpinx due to both the low success rate in achieving 
tubal patency and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. In fact, removal 
of  hydrosalpinges  by  salpingectomy  will  improve  pregnancy  rates  in 
subsequent  IVF  treatments.  If  a  proximal  tubal  blockage  is  observed 
on HSG, radiographically guided cannulation of fallopian tubes can be 
attempted. In women with bilateral tubal ligation, the decision between 
microsurgical reanastomosis versus IVF will depend on a number of

factors  including  patient’s  age,  ovarian  reserve,  number  of  children 
desired, partner’s semen parameters, and experience of the surgeon.
Ovulatory  Dysfunction  Endocrine  conditions  such  as  hypo-
thyroidism and hyperprolactinemia should be treated prior to use of 
ovulation  induction  medications.  Lifestyle  modifications  should  be 
recommended  in  patients  with  low  BMI  or  obesity.  Weight  loss  in 
obese women has been shown to increase the likelihood of spontane-
ous  or  drug-induced  ovulation.  First-line  treatment  for  women  with 
anovulatory  infertility  (most  common  etiology  is  PCOS)  includes 
use of medications such as letrozole and clomiphene citrate to induce 
ovulation. A large majority of women with PCOS (60–80%) respond to 
these oral medications, and the addition of metformin, as a second-line 
agent,  may  further  increase  the  chance  of  ovulation,  particularly  in 
obese women. In women with hypothalamic amenorrhea, behavioral 
modifications such as weight gain and decreased exercise may resume 
ovulation. If there is no response, judicious use of low-dose injectable 
gonadotropins  can  induce  monofollicular  growth.  In  women  with 
diminished ovarian reserve, treatment can be escalated from ovulation 
induction  with  oral  medications  and  intrauterine  insemination  (IUI) 
to IVF as the overall pregnancy rates are lower. In both women with 
diminished ovarian reserve and women with premature ovarian insuf-
ficiency, the option of using donor oocytes can be offered. In that case, 
the egg donor will undergo the IVF procedure, the harvested eggs are 
fertilized with the male partner’s sperm, and the fertilized embryos will 
be transferred to the patient’s uterus.
Male Infertility  Given the high prevalence of male factor infertil-
ity  (40–50%),  timely  evaluation  and  treatment  are  recommended.  In 
men with no sperm (azoospermia) in the ejaculate, further evaluation 
including a physical examination, endocrine tests, and genetics studies 
should  be  performed  to  identify  obstructive  (40%  prevalence  among 
men  with  azoospermia)  versus  nonobstructive  etiology.  First-line 
treatment  for  mild  to  moderate  male  factor  infertility  includes  IUI 
alone  or  IUI  combined  with  ovulation  induction,  depending  on  the 
female partner’s age and other causes of infertility. In men with severe 
male  factor  infertility,  IVF  with  intracytoplasmic  sperm  injection  is 
recommended.  In  men  with  obstructive  azoospermia,  sperm  can  be 
procured  by  direct  aspiration  from  the  epididymis  or  testis.  In  men 
with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), testing 
for  CFTR  mutations  and  genetic  counseling  are  indicated.  In  men 
with nonobstructive azoospermia, sperm retrieval from the testes may 
be less successful, and the use of donor sperm for IUI is an alternate 
option.  Men  with  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  (e.g.,  Kallmann’s 
syndrome) can be treated with gonadotropins to initiate spermatogen-
esis followed by IUI or IVF. Treatment of male sexual dysfunction and 
avoidance of exogenous androgens are effective strategies for address-
ing male factor infertility. Repair of a moderate to large varicocele is 
recommended when associated with abnormal semen parameters or if 
the patient is symptomatic from the varicocele.
Unexplained  Infertility 
In  15–30%  of  couples,  no  clear  causes 
of  infertility  are  identified.  In  such  cases,  it  is  appropriate  to  initiate 
ovarian  stimulation  with  oral  medications to  increase the  number  of 
developing oocytes and combine this with IUI timed to ovulation in 
order to increase the number of motile sperm in the reproductive tract. 
Depending on the age of the female partner, this approach offers mod-
est success rates and can be used for 3–6 months before recommending 
IVF. Overall, IVF is associated with a low risk of complications; the risk 
of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome has been significantly decreased 
by  judiciously  monitoring  stimulation  and  using  alternate  protocols. 
Multiple  pregnancy  remains  the  highest  risk  associated  with  IVF 
despite improvements in cryopreservation of embryos and age-based 
guidelines for the number of embryos to transfer. In some couples, the 
IVF  treatment  may  reveal  an  underlying  cause  of  infertility  such  as 
lower fertilization or embryo cleavage rates. Of note, guidelines from 
different  medical  societies  around  the  world  vary  in  the  rapidity  of 
offering IVF for unexplained infertility.
Uterine  Factors  Fibroids  are  the  most  common  benign  tumors 
of  the  reproductive  tract  and  occur  in  50–70%  of  reproductive-age 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   3052

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolism 
women. It is not clear whether fibroids decrease the likelihood of preg-
nancy;  submucosal  fibroids  and  intramural  fibroids  that  distort  the 
endometrial cavity may lower pregnancy rates and increase the risk of 
pregnancy loss. Removal of submucosal fibroids, uterine polyps, and 
adhesions hysteroscopically may improve subsequent pregnancy rates.

Endometriosis  Endometriosis is a common gynecologic condition 
associated  with  pelvic  pain  and  dysmenorrhea,  and  in  severe  cases, 
it  is  associated  with  tubo-ovarian  infertility.  Approximately  25–50% 
of  infertile  women  have  endometriosis,  and  30–50%  of  women  with 
endometriosis  have  infertility.  Prolonged  medical  management  to 
suppress  endometriotic  lesions  and  surgical  treatment  of  stage  1  and 
2 endometriosis have not been shown to improve subsequent fertility 
rates. Surgical removal of endometriotic lesions in women with stage 3 
or 4 endometriosis may improve subsequent pregnancy rates. First-line 
treatment  of  infertility  associated  with  endometriosis  alone  includes 
use of oral ovulation induction medications and IUI.
 ■ PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF INFERTILITY
It  is  well  recognized  that  infertility  is  associated  with  psychological 
stress  related  not  only  to  the  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  procedures 
themselves  but  also  to  repeated  cycles  of  hope  and  loss  associated 
with each new procedure or cycle of treatment that does not result in 
the birth of a child. These feelings are often combined with a sense of 
isolation from friends and family. Counseling and stress-management 
techniques  should  be  offered  early  in  the  evaluation  of  infertility. 
Importantly, infertility and its treatment do not appear to be associated 
with long-term psychological sequelae.

CONTRACEPTION
The  desired  ideal  number  of  children  per  family  varies  around  the 
globe  and  is  approximately  2.6  in  the  United  States.  Couples  not 
using  any  form  of  contraception  have  an  85%  chance  of  achieving  a 
pregnancy  over  1  year.  Based  on  these  data,  couples  spend  most  of 
their  reproductive  life  preventing  a  pregnancy  and  a  much  smaller 
proportion attempting to become or being pregnant. It is therefore not 
surprising that a majority of women who have been sexually active will 
have used some form of contraception to prevent a pregnancy. Unin-
tended pregnancies primarily occur due to lack of use or inconsistent 
use of contraceptives rather than failure of the contraceptive method 
used. Of the different forms of contraception used worldwide in 2019, 
tubal  sterilization  was  the  most  common  (~219  million)  followed  by 
use  of  male  condom  (189  million),  intrauterine  device  (IUD)  (159 
million), and the (birth control) pill (151 million). The rates of female 
sterilization  increased  steadily  in  the  last  century  and  now  show  a 
slight decrease, likely due to the increasing use of long-acting reversible 
contraceptive  (LARC)  agents,  such  as  IUDs  and  implants,  which  are 
as  effective  as  sterilization.  The  convenience  of  use  of  contraceptives 
determines  their  compliance  and  efficacy;  contraceptives  requiring 
daily  and  coitus-related  use  have  higher  failure  rates  compared  to 
long-acting  reversible  and  permanent  methods.  The  U.S.  Medical 
Eligibility Criteria (USMEC) for contraceptive use are evidence-based 
guidelines to help health care providers recommend appropriate con-
traceptives to women with chronic medical conditions (Table 396-2). 
This excellent resource is adapted from the WHO guidance and is kept 
up to date through continual review of published literature.

 ■ TYPES OF CONTRACEPTION
These can be classified in a number of ways, such as permanent versus 
reversible, hormonal versus nonhormonal, or barrier versus nonbarrier 
(Table 396-3).

Permanent Contraception  The permanent forms of contracep-
tion  include  tubal  sterilization  and  vasectomy,  with  twice  as  many 
women  choosing  permanent  sterilization  compared  to  men.  Vasec-
tomy  is  a  low-risk  procedure  typically  performed  in  an  outpatient 
setting with a very low failure rate of 0.1 pregnancies per 100 women 
per year. It is not immediately effective, and patients should be told 
to  use  other  forms  of  contraception  for  a  minimum  of  3  months 
after  the  procedure.  Tubal  sterilization  can  be  performed  in  the

postpartum period or as an interval procedure and has a failure rate 
of 0.5 pregnancies per 100 women per year. Postpartum sterilization 
can be performed during a cesarean section or after a vaginal delivery 
via  mini-laparotomy.  Interval  procedures  can  be  performed  laparo-
scopically  or  via  mini-laparotomy  and  include  partial  or  complete 
salpingectomy or occlusion of the fallopian tubes using electrocoagu-
lation or mechanical devices such as clips. These permanent methods 
of contraception are highly effective as they avoid the need for user- 
dependent  contraception.  All  patients  should  undergo  preprocedure 
counseling  regarding  risk  of  failure,  permanence  of  the  procedure, 
regret, and alternatives.

Hormonal  Contraceptives  •  COMBINED  ESTROGEN-  AND  PRO-
GESTIN-CONTAINING  CONTRACEPTIVES  The  mechanism  of  action 
of the hormonal contraceptives involves negative feedback from con-
tinuous  estrogen  administration,  thereby  decreasing  FSH  secretion, 
follicular  development,  and  formation  of  a  dominant  follicle.  The 
continuous progestin suppresses LH secretion and inhibits ovulation, 
alters endometrial receptivity, thickens the cervical mucus, and impairs 
tubal  motility.  These  hormones  can  be  delivered  via  oral  pills  to  be 
taken daily, as a transdermal patch that is changed weekly, or a vaginal 
ring  that  is  replaced  monthly  or  annually.  There  are  numerous  pills 
available containing different doses of estrogen (<50 μg) and types of 
progestins and varying doses within a pack (monophasic vs multipha-
sic); the pills can be taken in a cyclic or extended cycle schedule. The 
contraceptive  efficacy  is  similar  with  varying  doses  of  estrogen  and 
progestin. Decreasing the duration of hormone-free days may decrease 
some side effects associated with menses, such as menstrual migraines 
and  dysmenorrhea.  The  overall  failure  rate  for  combined  hormonal 
contraceptives  is  8  pregnancies  per  100  women  per  year,  although 
compliance with daily use of pills may be lower, affecting efficacy. The 
contraceptive patch and vaginal ring have higher compliance compared 
to daily pills. Use of the contraceptive patch is associated with a low risk

of skin reactions and a lower efficacy in women weighing >90 kg. The 
transdermal mode of delivery is associated with a higher steady state 
comparable  to  that  of  a  40-μg  ethinyl  estradiol  oral  contraceptive. 
Hormonal contraceptives offer additional benefits such as regulation of 
menstrual cycles; suppression of ovarian cysts; and decrease in menor-
rhagia, dysmenorrhea, and hyperandrogenism symptoms; in addition, 
they reduce the risk of both endometrial (50% reduction) and ovarian 
cancer  (40%  reduction).  Common  side  effects  include  nausea,  breast 
tenderness,  bloating,  and  intermenstrual  bleeding.  There  may  be  a 
mild increase in BP in some patients, and it is recommended to check 
BP  at  follow-up  visits.  In  large  studies  and  meta-analyses,  hormonal 
contraceptives  are  not  associated  with  significant  weight  gain,  mood 
changes, or effect on libido. Prior to administering hormonal contra-
ceptives,  a  detailed  patient  history  should  be  obtained  to  determine 
any absolute or relative contraindications to their use. Due to the low 
but slightly increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) associated 
with  estrogen-containing  hormonal  contraceptives  (3–15  per  10,000 
women-years), they are contraindicated in the immediate postpartum 
period, in smokers over the age of 35 years, and in women with a his-
tory  of  hereditary  thrombophilias  or  DVT.  The  association  between 
risk of DVT and different doses of estrogen (ethinyl estradiol <35 μg) 
or  different  routes  of  administration  (transdermal  patch)  is  weak. 
There is, however, some association between third- and fourth-generation 
progestins and risk of DVT. Routine screening for familial thrombotic 
disorders is not recommended prior to prescribing hormonal contra-
ceptives.  Although  obesity  is  associated  with  decreased  fertility,  the 
vast majority of women with obesity do not experience infertility. The 
USMEC classifies obesity alone as risk category 2, where the benefits of 
taking hormonal contraceptives outweigh any theoretical risk.
PROGESTIN-ONLY  HORMONAL  CONTRACEPTION  Different  types  of 
progestins  are  used  for  contraception  in  oral  pills,  injectable  forms, 
subdermal implants, and IUDs and may be an option for women who 
have contraindications to the use of estrogen-containing contraceptives 
(e.g.,  migraine  with  aura,  DVT,  stroke,  breast-feeding).  The  failure 
rate with progestin-only pills is 9 pregnancies per 100 women per year, 
whereas the failure rate of progestin IUDs is 0.1 pregnancies per 100 

women per year. In addition to acting as a spermicidal, the levonorge-
strel IUD also thickens the cervical mucus and thins the endometrium, 
thereby  decreasing  its  receptivity.  The  common  side  effect  is  irregu-
lar  bleeding,  pain,  and  rarely  expulsion.  Breakthrough  bleeding  or 
unscheduled bleeding is commonly reported, as estrogen usually serves 
to stabilize the endometrial lining and prolonged exposure to progestin 
alone results in a thinner decidualized lining. Depending on the device 
used, the progestin IUD is effective for 3–7 years. The injectable form 
of  progesterone  (medroxyprogesterone  acetate)  is  administered  every 
3 months with a failure rate of 3 pregnancies per 100 women per year. 
Its side effects include weight gain, irregular menses, amenorrhea, and 
mood changes, and there is a slow return to ovulation and fertility after 
discontinuation (6–9 months). The subdermal implant contains etono-
gestrel  and  is  placed  easily  over  the  triceps  muscle  in  the  inner  arm 
using local anesthesia. It lasts up to 5 years and has a failure rate of 0.05 
pregnancies per 100 women per year. Findings from the Contraceptive 
Choice  research  project  showed  that  continuation  rates  were  higher 
for  LARC  (IUDs  and  implants)  compared  to  short-acting  methods. 
LARCs  are  the  most  effective  reversible  form  of  contraception  with 
high continuation and satisfaction rates; hence, they are a good choice 
in adolescents and nulliparous women.

Nonhormonal IUD 
IUDs are a commonly used form of contra-
ception  worldwide  and  are  available  as  hormonal  and  nonhormonal 
devices. The nonhormonal copper IUD works as a spermicidal and is 
effective for up to 12 years with a failure rate of <1 pregnancy per 100 
women per year. Patients should be counseled regarding the increased 
risk  of  heavy  vaginal  bleeding  and  dysmenorrhea  resulting  in  higher 
discontinuation rates compared to the levonorgestrel-containing IUDs. 
IUDs  can  be  used  in  adolescents  and  adult  women  and  are  typically 
inserted and removed as an office procedure with use of mild analgesics. 
They can be inserted anytime during a menstrual cycle, referred to as 
interval insertion, and in the immediate postpartum and postabortion 
period.

Barrier  Contraception  The  barrier  forms  of  contraception 
include condoms (male, female) and diaphragm and cervical cap and 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   3054

20/01/22   3:23 PM

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismhave lower effectiveness secondary to inconsistent and incorrect use. 
They  offer  several  advantages  including  minimal  side  effects,  lower 
cost, no requirement for a prescription, and protection from sexually 
transmitted infections. The failure rate for male and female condoms is 
17–21 pregnancies per 100 women per year. Spermicidals can be used 
in conjunction with barrier methods to improve effectiveness.
Lactational Contraception  Lactation may serve as an effective form 
of contraception during the first 6 postpartum months if there is exclusive 
breast-feeding and menstrual cycles have not resumed. The contraceptive 
effect occurs due to suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulsa-
tility associated with suckling. The failure rate under these circumstances 
can be as low as 0.5–1.5 pregnancies per 100 women per year.
Fertility  Awareness  The  standard  days  method  is  typically  used 
by  women  with  regular  menstrual  cycles  whereby  they  track  their 
cycles to avoid intercourse from cycle days 8–19.
Emergency Contraception  Also known as postcoital contracep-
tion, this method is used after an unprotected or inadequately pro-
tected act of intercourse. The probability of pregnancy independent 
of the time of the month is 8%, but the probability varies significantly 
in  relation  to  proximity  to  ovulation  and  may  be  as  high  has  30%. 
Many women are not aware of the availability of emergency contra-
ception  and  its  appropriate  use.  As  the  probability  of  pregnancy  is 
highest if there has been unprotected intercourse during the 3 days 
prior  to  ovulation,  the  timing  of  administration  and  type  of  emer-
gency  contraceptive  used  determine  the  efficacy.  The  emergency 
contraception options include the copper IUD and oral medications 
such  as  ulipristal  acetate,  levonorgestrel,  and  combined  hormonal 
pills.  The  copper  IUD  prevents  fertilization  and  implantation  and 
is the most effective choice if inserted within 5 days of unprotected 
intercourse.  It  can  also  be  offered  to  obese  women  in  whom  other 
hormonal  forms  of  emergency  contraceptive  may  be  less  effective. 
Ulipristal  acetate,  a  progesterone  receptor  antagonist,  blocks  the 
ability of endogenous progesterone to act on its receptors and inhib-
its the LH surge, delaying or inhibiting ovulation, and may directly 
inhibit follicular rupture. It is administered as a 30-mg single dose up 
to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. Levonorgestrel administered 
as a single dose will prevent or delay ovulation and is associated with 
fewer  side  effects  compared  to  combined  hormonal  pills.  Overall, 
the  failure  rate  for  all  hormonal  emergency  contraception  is  1–3%, 
with  ulipristal  acetate  being  the  most  effective.  Emergency  contra-
ception should be offered to all women who ask for it up to 5 days 
after  unprotected  intercourse  and  not  delayed  in  order  to  obtain  a 
pregnancy  test  or  perform  a  clinical  examination.  Although  body 
weight can affect the efficacy of emergency hormonal contraception, 
it should not be withheld from overweight and obese women.
 ■ CONTRACEPTION COUNSELING
Patients should be provided information regarding the different meth-
ods of contraception, side effects, noncontraceptive benefits, efficacy, 
need for strict compliance, and impact on future fertility. In order to 
facilitate  patient-centric  care,  the  provider  should  discuss  plans  for 
future  pregnancy  and  whether  childbearing  is  complete.  A  detailed 
patient  history  should  be  reviewed  to  identify  potential  contrain-
dications  such  as  migraines  with  aura,  smoking,  and  hypertension. 
Providers should refer to the most updated USMEC or WHO Medical 
Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use guidelines when counseling 
patients with associated comorbidities. As part of the shared decision-
making  approach,  the  patient’s  choice  should  be  the  guiding  factor, 
and  the  discussion  should  be  nonjudgmental.  Adolescents  should  be 
offered access to the full range of contraceptive options. In a low-risk 
patient,  hormonal  contraceptives  can  be  prescribed  from  menarche 
to  menopause;  regular  evaluation  of  side  effects  and  assessment  of 
changes in the patient’s medical history, however, are required.

397 Sexual Dysfunction

Kevin T. McVary

Male  sexual  dysfunction  affects  up  to  31%  of  middle-aged  and 
elderly men, whereas female sexual dysfunction, although studied less 
intensely, has a higher prevalence (43%) than male sexual dysfunction. 
Demographic changes, the popularity of newer treatments, and greater 
awareness  of  sexual  dysfunction  by  patients  and  society  have  led  to 
increased  diagnosis  and  associated  health  care  expenditures  for  the 
management of this common disorder. Sexual health and satisfaction 
with sex life are important aspects of quality of life for many, including 
those  in  poor  health.  Because  many  patients  are  reluctant  to  initiate 
discussion  of  their  sex  lives,  physicians  should  address  this  topic 
directly to elicit a history of sexual dysfunction. Specifically addressing 
sexual health should be a routine part of the clinical encounter.

MALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION
 ■ PHYSIOLOGY OF MALE SEXUAL RESPONSE
Normal  male  sexual  function  includes  (1)  sufficient  libido,  (2)  the 
ability  to  achieve  and  maintain  penile  erection,  (3)  ejaculation,  and 
(4) detumescence. Libido refers to sexual desire and is influenced by a 
variety of visual, olfactory, tactile, auditory, imaginative, and hormonal 
stimuli.  Sex  steroids,  particularly  testosterone,  act  to  increase  libido. 
Libido can be diminished by emotional context, systemic illness, hor-
monal disturbances, psychiatric disorders, and medications.

Penile tumescence leading to erection depends on an increased flow 
of blood into the lacunar network accompanied by complete relaxation 
of the arteries and corporal smooth muscle. The microarchitecture of 
the corpora is composed of a mass of smooth muscle (trabecula) that 
contains a network of endothelial-lined vessels (lacunar spaces). Subse-
quent compression of the trabecular smooth muscle against the fibro-
elastic tunica albuginea causes a passive closure of the emissary veins 
and  accumulation  of  blood  in  the  corpora.  In  the  presence  of  a  full 
erection and a competent valve mechanism, the corpora become non-
compressible  cylinders  from  which  blood  does  not  escape.  This  cas-
cade of relaxation and venous occlusion culminates in a rigid erection.
The  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  exerts  an  important  influence 
by  either  stimulating  or  antagonizing  spinal  pathways  that  mediate 
erectile  function  and  ejaculation.  The  erectile  response  is  mediated

3056 by a combination of central (psychogenic) innervation and peripheral 
(reflexogenic) innervation. Sensory nerves that originate from recep-
tors in the penile skin and glans converge to form the dorsal nerve of 
the penis, which travels to the S2-S4 dorsal root ganglia via the puden-
dal nerve. Parasympathetic nerve fibers to the penis arise from neurons 
in the intermediolateral columns of the S2-S4 sacral spinal segments. 
Sympathetic  innervation  originates  from  the  T-11  to  the  L-2  spinal 
segments and descends through the hypogastric plexus.

Neural  input  to  smooth-muscle  tone  is  crucial  to  the  initiation 
and maintenance of an erection. There is also an intricate interaction 
between the corporal smooth-muscle cell and its overlying endothelial 
cell lining (Fig. 397-1). Nitric oxide, which induces vascular relaxation, 
promotes  erection  and  is  opposed  by  endothelin  1  (ET-1)  and  Rho 
kinase, which mediate vascular contraction. Nitric oxide is synthesized 
from  L-arginine  by  nitric  oxide  synthase  (NOS)  and  is  released  from 
the  nonadrenergic,  noncholinergic  (NANC)  autonomic  nerve  supply 
to  act  postjunctionally  on  smooth-muscle  cells.  Nitric  oxide  increases 
the production of cyclic 3′,5′-guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP), 
which induces relaxation of smooth muscle (Fig. 397-2). Cyclic GMP 
is  metabolized  by  phosphodiesterase  type  5  (PDE-5).  Inhibitors  of 
PDE-5  such  as  the  oral  medications  sildenafil,  tadalafil,  vardenafil, 
and  avanafil  maintain  erections  by  reducing  the  breakdown  of  cyclic 

GMP. However, if nitric oxide is not produced at some level, PDE-5 
inhibitors are ineffective, as these drugs facilitate, but do not initiate, 
the initial enzyme cascade. In addition to nitric oxide, vasoactive pros-
taglandins (PGE1, PGF2α) are synthesized within the cavernosal tissue 
and increase cyclic AMP levels, also leading to relaxation of cavernosal 
smooth-muscle cells.

Ejaculation  is  stimulated  by  the  sympathetic  nervous  system;  this 
results in contraction of the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, 
and prostate, causing seminal fluid to enter the urethra. Seminal fluid 
emission is followed by rhythmic contractions of the bulbocavernosus 
and ischiocavernosus muscles, leading to ejaculation. This is followed 
by  expulsion,  characterized  by  stereotypic  rhythmic  contractions  of 
the striated perineal muscles, leading to forceful expulsion of semen 
with  the  bladder  neck  closed.  This  emission  and  expulsion  are  con-
trolled  by  the  autonomic  (parasympathetic  and  sympathetic)  and 
somatic  spinal  centers,  respectively.  The  synchronization  between 
autonomic and somatic spinal centers is orchestrated by interneurons 
that  form  a  spinal  ejaculation  generator  that  is  present  in  mammals 
including man.

Premature  ejaculation  usually  is  related  to  anxiety  or  a  learned 
behavior  and  is  amenable  to  behavioral  therapy  or  treatment  with 
medications  such  as  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs).

FIGURE 397-1  Pathways that control erection and detumescence. Outflow from the parasympathetic nervous system leads to relaxation of the cavernous sinusoids in 
two ways, both of which increase the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in smooth-muscle cells. First, NO is the neurotransmitter in nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) 
fibers; second, stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) through cholinergic output causes increased production of NO. The NO produced in the endothelium 
then  diffuses  into  the  smooth-muscle  cells  and  decreases  its  intracellular  calcium  concentration  through  a  pathway  mediated  by  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate 
(cGMP),  leading  to  relaxation.  A  separate  mechanism  that  decreases  the  intracellular  calcium  level  is  mediated  by  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (cAMP).  With 
increased cavernosal blood flow, as well as increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the endothelial release of NO is further sustained through the 
phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase pathway. Active treatments (red boxes) include drugs that affect the cGMP pathway (phosphodiesterase type 5 [PDE-5] inhibitors and 
guanylyl cyclase agonists), the cAMP pathway (alprostadil), or both pathways (papaverine), along with neural-tone mediators (phentolamine and Rho kinase inhibitors).

disease. Consequently, ED represents a “sentinel symptom” in patients 
with occult cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease.

Smoking is also a significant risk factor in the development of ED. 
Medications  used  in  treating  diabetes  or  cardiovascular  disease  are 
additional risk factors (see below). There is a higher incidence of ED 
among men who have undergone radiation or surgery for prostate can-
cer and in those with a lower spinal cord injury. Psychological causes of 
ED include depression, anger, stress from employment or relationships, 
anxiety, and other stress-related causes.

Retrograde ejaculation (RE) results when the internal urethral sphinc-
ter does not close; it may occur in men with diabetes or after surgery 
involving the bladder neck. Anejaculation, the failure of a portion or 
the  whole  of  the  emission  process  often  confused  with  RE,  is  com-
monly the result of selective alpha blockers used in male voiding dys-
function (e.g., tamsulosin, silodosin).

Detumescence is mediated by norepinephrine from the sympathetic 
nerves, endothelin from the vascular surface, and smooth-muscle con-
traction induced by postsynaptic α-adrenergic receptors and activation 
of  Rho  kinase.  These  events  increase  venous  outflow  and  restore  the 
flaccid  state.  Venous  leak  can  cause  premature  detumescence  and  is 
caused by insufficient relaxation of the corporal smooth muscle rather 
than  a  specific  anatomic  defect.  Priapism  refers  to  a  persistent  and 
painful erection and may be associated with sickle cell anemia, hyper-
coagulable states, spinal cord injury, or injection of vasodilator agents 
into the penis.
 ■ ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION
Epidemiology  Erectile  dysfunction  (ED)  is  not  considered  a 
normal  part  of  the  aging  process.  Nonetheless,  it  is  associated  with 
certain  physiologic  and  psychological  changes  related  to  age.  In  the 
Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS), a community-based survey 
of men aged 40–70, 52% of responders reported some degree of ED. 
Complete ED occurred in 10% of respondents, moderate ED in 25%, 
and minimal ED in 17%. The incidence of moderate or severe ED more 
than  doubled  between  the  ages  of  40  and  70.  In  the  National  Health 
and Social Life Survey (NHSLS), which included a sample of men and 
women  aged  18–59,  10%  of  men  reported  being  unable  to  maintain 
an  erection  (corresponding  to  the  proportion  of  men  in  the  MMAS 
reporting  severe  ED).  Incidence  was  highest  among  men  in  the  age 
group 50–59 (21%) and men who were poor (14%), divorced (14%), 
and less educated (13%).

The incidence of ED is also higher among men with certain medical 
disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, lower urinary tract symp-
toms  secondary  to  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia  (LUTS/BPH),  heart 
disease, hypertension, decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) lev-
els, and diseases associated with general systemic inflammation (e.g., 
rheumatoid arthritis). Cardiovascular disease and ED share etiologies 
as  well  as  pathophysiology  (e.g.,  endothelial  dysfunction),  and  the 
degree of ED appears to correlate with the severity of cardiovascular

Pathophysiology  ED  may  result  from  three  basic  mechanisms: 
(1) failure to initiate (psychogenic, endocrinologic, or neurogenic), (2) 
failure to fill (arteriogenic), and (3) failure to store adequate blood vol-
ume within the lacunar network (veno-occlusive dysfunction). These 
categories are not mutually exclusive, and multiple factors contribute to 
ED in many patients. For example, diminished filling pressure can lead 
secondarily to venous leak. Psychogenic factors frequently coexist with 
other etiologic factors and should be considered in all cases. Diabetic, 
atherosclerotic, and drug-related causes account for >80% of cases of 
ED in older men.

Vasculogenic  The  most  common  organic  cause  of  ED  is  a  dis-
turbance  of  blood  flow  to  and  from  the  penis.  Atherosclerotic  or 
traumatic  arterial  disease  can  decrease  flow  to  the  lacunar  spaces, 
resulting in decreased rigidity and an increased time to full erection. 
Excessive  outflow  through  the  veins  despite  adequate  inflow  also 
may contribute to ED. Structural alterations to the fibroelastic com-
ponents of the corpora may cause a loss of compliance and inability 
to compress the tunical veins. This condition may result from aging, 
increased  cross-linking  of  collagen  fibers  induced  by  nonenzymatic 
glycosylation,  hypoxemia,  or  altered  synthesis  of  collagen  associated 
with hypercholesterolemia.

Neurogenic  Disorders  that  affect  the  sacral  spinal  cord  or  the 
autonomic  fibers  to  the  penis  preclude  nervous  system  relaxation  of 
penile smooth muscle, thus leading to ED. In patients with spinal cord 
injury, the degree of ED depends on the completeness and level of the 
lesion.  Patients  with  incomplete  lesions  or  injuries  to  the  upper  part 
of  the  spinal  cord  are  more  likely  to  retain  erectile  capabilities  than 
are those with complete lesions or injuries to the lower part. Although 
75% of patients with spinal cord injuries have some erectile capability, 
only  25%  have  erections  sufficient  for  penetration.  Other  neurologic 
disorders  commonly  associated  with  ED  include  multiple  sclerosis 
and  peripheral  neuropathy.  The  latter  is  often  due  to  either  diabetes 
or alcoholism. Pelvic surgery may cause ED through disruption of the 
autonomic nerve supply.

Endocrinologic  Androgens  increase  libido,  but  their  exact  role 
in  erectile  function  is  unclear.  Individuals  with  castrate  levels  of 
testosterone  can  achieve  erections  from  visual  or  sexual  stimuli. 
Nonetheless, normal levels of testosterone appear to be important for 
erectile function, in which the upregulation of nitric oxide synthase 
and  the  nitric  oxide  cascade  is  optimized  (Fig.  397-1A).  Androgen 
replacement  therapy  can  improve  depressed  erectile  function  when 
it  is  secondary  to  hypogonadism;  however,  it  is  not  useful  for  ED 
when endogenous testosterone levels are normal. Increased prolactin 
may decrease libido by suppressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
(GnRH)  resulting  in  decreased  testosterone  levels.  Treatment  of 
hyperprolactinemia  with  dopamine  agonists  can  restore  libido  and 
eugonadism.

Diabetic  ED  occurs  in  35–75%  of  men  with  diabetes  mellitus. 
Pathologic  mechanisms  are  related  primarily  to  diabetes-associated 
vascular  and  neurologic  complications.  Diabetic  macrovascular 
complications  are  related  mainly  to  age,  whereas  microvascular 
complications correlate with the duration of diabetes and the degree 
of glycemic control (Chap. 403). Individuals with diabetes also have 
reduced  amounts  of  nitric  oxide  synthase  in  both  endothelial  and 
neural tissues.

Psychogenic  Two  mechanisms  contribute  to  the  inhibition  of 
erections  in  psychogenic  ED.  First,  psychogenic  stimuli  to  the  sacral 
cord  may  inhibit  reflexogenic  responses,  thereby  blocking  activation 
of vasodilator outflow to the penis. Second, excess sympathetic stim-
ulation in an anxious man may increase penile smooth-muscle tone. 
The most common causes of psychogenic ED are performance anxiety, 
depression,  relationship  conflict,  loss  of  attraction,  sexual  inhibition, 
conflicts  over  sexual  preference,  sexual  abuse  in  childhood,  and  fear 
of pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease. Almost all patients with 
ED, even when it has a defined organic basis, develop a psychogenic 
component as a reaction to ED.

Medication-Related  Medication-induced  ED  (Table  397-1)  is 
estimated  to  occur  in  25%  of  men  seen  in  general  medical  clinics. 
The  adverse  effects  related  to  drug  therapy  are  additive,  especially 
in  older  men.  In  addition  to  the  drug  itself,  the  underlying  disease 
being treated is likely to contribute to sexual dysfunction (e.g., hyper-
tension).  Among  the  antihypertensive  agents,  the  thiazide  diuretics 
and  beta  blockers  have  been  implicated  most  frequently.  Calcium 
channel  blockers  and  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors  are 
cited  less  frequently.  These  drugs  may  act  directly  at  the  corporal 
level  (e.g.,  calcium  channel  blockers)  or  indirectly  by  reducing  pel-
vic blood pressure, which is important in the development of penile 
rigidity. α-Adrenergic blockers are less likely to cause ED. Estrogens, 
GnRH agonists, H2 antagonists, and spironolactone cause ED by sup-
pressing  gonadotropin  production  or  by  blocking  androgen  action. 
Antidepressant  and  antipsychotic  agents—particularly  neuroleptics, 
tricyclics, and SSRIs—are associated with erectile, ejaculatory, orgas-
mic, and sexual desire difficulties. Among the SSRIs, paroxetine and 
escitalopram  have  been  associated  with  the  highest  risk  of  sexual 
dysfunction.  Bupropion,  nefazodone,  and  mirtazapine  appear  less 
likely to cause sexual dysfunction. A number of molecular pathways 
have been implicated in antidepressant-induced sexual adverse events. 
Serotonin has been hypothesized to inhibit normal sexual response by 
decreasing  dopamine-enhanced  libido,  arousal,  and  erection  and  by 
increasing prolactin release. SSRIs have also been shown to be potent 
inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase.

If there is a strong association between the institution of a drug and 
the onset of ED, alternative medications should be considered. Other-
wise, it is often practical to treat the ED without attempting multiple 
changes in medications as it may be difficult to establish a causal role 
for a drug.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Erectile Dysfunction

A  good  physician–patient  relationship  helps  unravel  the  possible 
causes  of  ED,  many  of  which  require  discussion  of  personal  and 
sensitive  topics.  For  this  reason,  a  primary  care  provider  is  often 
ideally  suited  to  initiate  the  evaluation.  However,  a  significant 
percentage of men experience ED and remain undiagnosed unless 
specifically questioned about this issue. By far the two most com-
mon reasons for underreporting of ED are patient embarrassment 
and  perceptions  of  physicians’  inattention  to  the  disorder.  Once 
the topic is initiated by the physician, patients are more willing to 
discuss their potency issues. A complete medical and sexual history 
should be taken in an effort to assess whether the cause of ED is 
organic, psychogenic, or multifactorial (Fig. 397-3).

Both  the  patient  and  his  sexual  partner  should  be  interviewed 
regarding  sexual  history.  ED  should  be  distinguished  from  other 
sexual  problems,  such  as  premature  ejaculation.  Lifestyle  factors 
such  as  sexual  orientation,  the  patient’s  distress  from  ED,  perfor-
mance anxiety, and details of sexual techniques should be addressed. 
Validated  questionnaires  are  available  to  assess  ED,  including  the 
International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the more easily 
administered Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM), a validated 
abridged version of the IIEF. These can assess the severity of ED,

The  initial  evaluation  of  ED  begins  with  a  review  of  the  patient’s 
medical,  surgical,  sexual,  and  psychosocial  histories.  The  history 
should  note  whether  the  patient  has  experienced  pelvic  trauma, 
surgery,  or  radiation.  In  light  of  the  increasing  recognition  of  the 
relationship  between  lower  urinary  tract  symptoms  (LUTS/BPH) 
and ED, it is advisable to evaluate for the presence of associated uri-
nary symptoms. Questions should focus on the onset of symptoms, 
the presence and duration of partial erections, and the progression

of  ED.  A  history  of  nocturnal  or  early  morning  erections  may  be 
useful  for  distinguishing  physiologic  ED  from  psychogenic  ED. 
Nocturnal erections occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 
and  require  intact  neurologic  and  circulatory  systems.  Organic 
causes  of  ED  generally  are  characterized  by  a  gradual  and  persis-
tent change in rigidity or the inability to sustain nocturnal, coital, 
or  self-stimulated  erections.  The  patient  should  be  questioned 
about  the  presence  of  penile  curvature  or  pain  with  coitus.  It  is 
also important to address libido, as decreased sexual drive and ED 
are  sometimes  the  earliest  signs  of  endocrine  abnormalities  (e.g., 
increased  prolactin,  decreased  testosterone  levels).  It  is  useful  to 
ask whether the problem is confined to coitus with one partner or 
also involves other partners; ED not uncommonly arises with new 
or extramarital sexual relationships. Situational ED, as opposed to 
consistent ED, suggests psychogenic causes. For men being treated 
for ED, referral to a mental health professional should be considered 
to promote treatment adherence, reduce performance anxiety, and 
integrate treatments into a sexual relationship. Ejaculation is much 
less  commonly  affected  than  erection,  but  questions  should  be 
asked about whether ejaculation is normal, premature, delayed, or 
absent. Relevant risk factors should be identified, such as diabetes 
mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), and neurologic disorders. 
The patient’s surgical history should be explored with an emphasis 
on  bowel,  bladder,  prostate,  and  vascular  procedures.  A  complete 
drug history, including tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drug 
inquiries, is also important. Social changes that may precipitate ED 
are also crucial to the evaluation, including health worries, spousal 
death, divorce, relationship difficulties, and financial concerns.

Because  ED  commonly  involves  a  host  of  endothelial  cell  risk 
factors, men with ED report higher rates of overt and silent myocar-
dial infarction. Therefore, ED in an otherwise asymptomatic male 
warrants consideration of other vascular disorders, including CAD.
Men who suffer from ED are at high risk for concomitant LUTS 
from BPH and vice versa. Given that some treatments of one dis-
order will impact the other, the clinician should consider an assess-
ment of LUTS in any man with ED.

The physical examination is an essential element in the assess-
ment of ED. Signs of hypertension as well as evidence of thyroid, 
hepatic,  hematologic,  cardiovascular,  or  renal  diseases  should  be 
sought. An assessment should be made of the endocrine and vas-
cular  systems,  the  external  genitalia,  and  the  prostate  gland.  The

sexual characteristics are suggestive of hypogonadism. Neurologic 
examination  should  include  assessment  of  anal  sphincter  tone, 
investigation of the bulbocavernosus reflex, and testing for periph-
eral neuropathy.

Although hyperprolactinemia is uncommon, a serum prolactin 
level should be measured in hypogonadal men, as decreased libido 
and/or ED may be the presenting symptoms of a prolactinoma or 
another  mass  lesion  of  the  sella  (Chap.  380).  The  serum  testos-
terone  level  should  be  measured,  and  if  it  is  low,  gonadotropins 
should  be  measured  to  determine  whether  hypogonadism  is  pri-
mary  (testicular)  or  secondary  (hypothalamic-pituitary)  in  origin   
(Chap.  391).  If  not  performed  recently,  serum  chemistries,  com-
plete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin A1c, and lipid profiles may be 
of value, as they can yield evidence of anemia, diabetes, hyperlipi-
demia, or other systemic diseases associated with ED.

Additional diagnostic testing is rarely necessary in the evaluation 
of ED. However, in selected patients, specialized testing may provide 
insight into pathologic mechanisms of ED and aid in the selection 
of treatment options. Optional specialized testing includes (1) stud-
ies of nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity, (2) vascular testing 
(in-office injection of vasoactive substances, penile Doppler ultra-
sound,  penile  angiography,  dynamic  infusion  cavernosography/
cavernosometry),  (3)  neurologic  testing  (biothesiometry-graded 
vibratory  perception,  somatosensory-evoked  potentials),  and  (4) 
psychological diagnostic tests. The information potentially gained 
from these procedures must be balanced against their invasiveness, 
cost, and impact on ultimate treatment outcome.

Clinicians should counsel men with ED who have comorbidities 
known  to  negatively  affect  erectile  function  that  lifestyle  modifi-
cations,  including  changes  in  diet  and  increased  physical  activity, 
improve overall health and may improve erectile function.

TREATMENT
Male Sexual Dysfunction 

PATIENT EDUCATION
Patient and partner education is essential in the treatment of ED. 
In  goal-directed  therapy,  education  facilitates  understanding  of 
the disease, the results of the tests, and the selection of treatment. 
Discussion of treatment options helps clarify how treatment is best 
offered  and  stratify  first-  and  second-line  therapies.  Patients  with 
high-risk  lifestyle  issues  such  as  obesity,  smoking,  alcohol  abuse, 
and  recreational  drug  use  should  be  counseled  on  the  role  those 
factors play in the development of ED.

Therapies  currently  employed  for  the  treatment  of  ED  include 
oral  phosphodiesterase  type  5  inhibitor  (PDE-5i)  therapy  (most 
commonly  used),  injection  therapies,  testosterone  therapy,  penile 
devices, and psychological therapy. In addition, limited data suggest 
that  treatments  for  underlying  risk  factors  and  comorbidities—
for  example,  weight  loss,  exercise,  stress  reduction,  and  smoking   
cessation—may  improve  erectile  function.  Decisions  regarding 
therapy should take into account the preferences and expectations 
of patients and their partners. 
ORAL AGENTS
Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil are the only approved 
and effective oral agents for the treatment of ED. These four med-
ications have markedly improved the management of ED because 
they  are  effective  for  the  treatment  of  a  broad  range  of  causes, 
including psychogenic, diabetic, vasculogenic, post radical prosta-
tectomy  (nerve-sparing  procedures),  and  post  spinal  cord  injury. 
They belong to a class of medications that are selective and potent 
inhibitors  of  PDE-5,  the  predominant  phosphodiesterase  isoform 
found  in  the  penis.  They  are  administered  in  graduated  doses 
and  enhance  erections  after  sexual  stimulation  (Fig.  397-2).  The 
onset  of  action  is  ~30–120  min,  depending  on  the  medication 
used and other factors, such as recent food intake. Reduced initial

doses should be considered for patients who are elderly, are taking 
concomitant alpha blockers, have renal insufficiency, or are taking 
medications  that  inhibit  the  CYP3A4  metabolic  pathway  in  the 
liver (e.g., erythromycin, cimetidine, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, 
diltiazem, itraconazole, ritonavir, verapamil, grapefruit, and possi-
bly  itraconazole  and  mibefradil),  as  they  may  increase  the  serum 
concentration of the PDE-5i or promote hypotension.

Initially,  there  were  concerns  about  the  cardiovascular  safety 
of these drugs. It is known that these agents can act as mild vaso-
dilators,  and  warnings  exist  about  orthostatic  hypotension  with 
concomitant  use  of  alpha  blockers.  The  use  of  PDE-5is  is  not 
contraindicated in men who are also receiving alpha blockers, but 
they must be stabilized on the medication prior to initiating PDE-5i 
therapy.  Earlier  concerns  that  the  use  of  PDE-5is  would  increase 
cardiovascular events have been mitigated by the results of several 
controlled trials showing no increase in myocardial ischemic events 
or overall mortality compared to the general population.

Several randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of this 
class of medications. There are no compelling data to support the 
superiority of one PDE-5i over another. Subtle differences between 
agents have variable clinical relevance (Table 397-2).

Patients  may  fail  to  respond  to  a  PDE-5i  for  several  reasons 
(Table  397-3).  Some  patients  may  not  tolerate  PDE-5i  secondary 
to adverse events from vasodilation in nonpenile tissues expressing 
PDE-5 or from the inhibition of homologous nonpenile isozymes 
(i.e., PDE-6 found in the retina). Abnormal vision attributed to the 
effects  of  PDE-5i  on  retinal  PDE-6  is  of  short  duration,  reported 
only with sildenafil, and not thought to be clinically significant. A 
more serious concern is the possibility that PDE-5is may cause non-
arteritic  anterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy  (NAION);  although 
data to support that association are limited, it is prudent to avoid 
the use of these agents in men with a prior history of NAION.

Testosterone supplementation combined with a PDE-5i may be 
beneficial in improving erectile function in hypogonadal men with 
ED  who  are  unresponsive  to  PDE-5i  alone.  These  drugs  do  not 
affect  ejaculation,  orgasm,  or  sexual  drive.  Side  effects  associated 
with  PDE-5is  include  headaches  (19%),  facial  flushing  (9%),  dys-
pepsia (6%), and nasal congestion (4%). Approximately 7% of men 
using sildenafil may experience transient altered color vision (blue 
halo  effect),  and  6%  of  men  taking  tadalafil  may  experience  loin 
pain. PDE-5i is contraindicated in men receiving nitrate therapy for 

TABLE 397-3  Issues to Consider if Patients Report Failure of 
Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitor (PDE-5i) to Improve Erectile 
Dysfunction
1.  A trial of medication on at least 6 different days at the maximal dose should 

be performed before declaring patient nonresponsive to PDE-5i use.
2.  Confirm that the patient did not partake in a high-fat meal prior to taking 

medication; pertains to sildenafil.

3.  Failure to include physical and psychic stimulation at the time of foreplay to 

induce endogenous NO.

4.  Took medications at an appropriate time frame prior to step 3: half-hour prior

cardiovascular disease, including agents delivered by the oral, sub-
lingual, transnasal, and topical routes. These agents can potentiate 
its hypotensive effect and may result in profound shock. Likewise, 
amyl/butyl nitrate “poppers” may have a fatal synergistic effect on 
blood  pressure.  PDE-5is  also  should  be  avoided  in  patients  with 
congestive  heart  failure  and  cardiomyopathy  because  of  the  risk 
of vascular collapse. Because sexual activity leads to an increase in 
physiologic expenditure (5–6 metabolic equivalent tasks [METs]), 
physicians have been advised to exercise caution in prescribing any 
drug for sexual activity to those with active coronary disease, heart 
failure,  borderline  hypotension,  or  hypovolemia  and  to  those  on 
complex antihypertensive regimens.

Although the various forms of PDE-5is have a common mech-
anism of action, there are a few differences among the four agents 
(Table  397-2).  Tadalafil  is  unique  in  its  longer  half-life,  and  ava-
nafil appears to have the fastest onset of action. All four drugs are 
effective for patients with ED of all ages, severities, and etiologies. 
Although  there  are  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  dif-
ferences among these agents, clinically relevant differences are not 
clear. 
ANDROGEN THERAPY
Testosterone replacement is used to treat both primary and secondary 
causes of hypogonadism (Chap. 391). Men with ED and testosterone 
deficiency  (TD)  who  are  considering  ED  treatment  with  a  PDE-5i 
should be informed that PDE-5is may be more effective if combined

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismwith testosterone therapy. Androgen supplementation in the setting 
of normal testosterone is not efficacious in the treatment of ED and is 
discouraged secondary to additional risk for toxicity without benefit. 
Methods of androgen replacement include transdermal patches and 
gels, including cutaneous nasal and axillary gels. Parenteral long-act-
ing  testosterone  esters  (enanthate  and  cypionate),  long-acting  sub-
cutaneous pellets, and oral preparations (17 α-alkylated derivatives) 
are also available (Chap. 391). With the possible exception a newer 
oral testosterone undecanoate, oral androgen preparations have the 
potential for hepatotoxicity and should be avoided.

The  increased  scrutiny  of  testosterone  caused  the  U.S.  Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue a warning that there is a 
“weak signal” that testosterone replacement therapy increases the 
risk of thromboembolic events and may have addictive properties. 
Although  testosterone  therapy  has  known  risks,  such  as  water 
retention  in  heart  failure  patients  and  worsening  sleep  apnea, 
increasing evidence suggests that, when monitored appropriately, 
this  therapy  decreases  the  risk  for  metabolic  syndrome,  changes 
body composition by increasing lean muscle mass, and improves 
insulin  sensitivity  and  average  hemoglobin  A1c.  This  evidence, 
combined with the fact that hypogonadism is a known risk factor 
for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, has led to the 
conclusion that testosterone therapy for age-related hypogonadism 
in  fact  improves  overall  health  and  decreases  the  risk  of  cardio-
vascular  events.  It  is  important  to  note  that  men  with  secondary 
hypogonadism  who  desire  fertility  should  not  be  treated  directly 
with  testosterone,  but  with  an  alternative  such  as  the  selective 
estrogen  receptor  modulator  (SERM)  clomiphene  citrate,  which 
increases  gonadotropin  levels,  stimulating  testicular  testosterone 
production.

Testosterone circulates in the body in two forms: free and unbound 
or that bound to proteins such as albumin or sex hormone–binding 
globulin (SHBG). SHBG has a very high affinity for testosterone, and 
thus,  testosterone  bound  to  SHBG  does  not  bind  to  the  androgen 
receptor and is not bioavailable. Bioavailable testosterone is any tes-
tosterone that is not bound to SHBG. Unfortunately, reliable assays 
to directly measure bioavailable testosterone or free testosterone are 
expensive, difficult to perform, and thus not offered by most labo-
ratories. However, direct measurement of SHBG is inexpensive and 
reliable, allowing free and bioavailable testosterone to be calculated.

Men  who  receive  testosterone  should  be  reevaluated  after   
3–6 months and at least annually thereafter for testosterone levels, 
erectile function, and adverse effects, which may include gyneco-
mastia, sleep apnea, development or exacerbation of LUTS or BPH, 
prostate cancer, lowering of HDL, erythrocytosis, elevations of liver 
function  tests,  and  reduced  fertility.  Periodic  reevaluation  should 
include measurement of hemoglobin and prostate-specific antigen 
and digital rectal examination. Therapy should be discontinued in 
patients who do not respond within 6 months without an alternate 
explanation (e.g., elevated estradiol). 

VACUUM CONSTRICTION DEVICES
Vacuum  constriction  devices  (VCDs)  are  a  well-established  non-
invasive  therapy.  They  are  a  reasonable  treatment  alternative  for 
select  patients  who  cannot  take  PDE-5is  or  do  not  desire  other 
interventions.  VCDs  draw  venous  blood  into  the  penis  and  use  a 
constriction  ring  to  restrict  venous  return  and  maintain  tumes-
cence. Adverse events with VCD include pain, numbness, bruising, 
and altered ejaculation. Additionally, many patients complain that 
the devices are cumbersome and that the induced erections have a 
nonphysiologic appearance and feel. 

INTRAURETHRAL ALPROSTADIL
If a patient fails to respond to oral agents, a reasonable next choice is 
intraurethral or self-injection of vasoactive substances. Intraurethral 
prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil), in the form of a semisolid pellet (doses 
of 125–1000 μg), is delivered with an applicator. Approximately 65% 
of men receiving intraurethral alprostadil respond with an erection 
when  tested  in  the  office,  but  <50%  achieve  successful  coitus  at

home. Intraurethral insertion is associated with a markedly reduced 
incidence of priapism in comparison to intracavernosal injection. 
INTRACAVERNOSAL SELF-INJECTION
Injection  of  synthetic  formulations  of  alprostadil  is  effective  in 
70–80%  of  patients  with  ED,  but  discontinuation  rates  are  high 
because  of  the  invasive  nature  of  administration.  Doses  range 
between 1 and 40 μg. Injection therapy is contraindicated in men 
with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug and men at risk for 
priapism  (hypercoagulable  states,  sickle  cell  disease).  Side  effects 
include local adverse events, prolonged erections, pain, and fibrosis 
with  chronic  use.  Various  combinations  of  alprostadil,  phentola-
mine, and/or papaverine sometimes are used. 
SURGERY
An  important  but  less  frequently  used  form  of  therapy  for  ED 
involves  the  surgical  implantation  of  a  semirigid  or  inflatable 
penile prosthesis. Because of the permanence of prosthetic devices, 
patients  should  first  consider  less  invasive  options  for  treatment. 
These  surgical  treatments  are  associated  with  a  low  rate  of  com-
plications and are used for those who do not want the less spon-
taneous medical treatments, in PDE-5i–refractory ED, or in men 
who  cannot  tolerate  such  medications.  Despite  the  requirement 
for surgery, penile prostheses are associated with very high rates of 
patient and partner satisfaction. 
SEX THERAPY
A  course  of  sex  therapy  may  be  useful  for  addressing  specific 
interpersonal  factors  that  may  affect  sexual  functioning.  These 
approaches  may  be  useful  in  patients  who  have  psychogenic  or 
social  components  to  their  ED,  although  data  from  random-
ized  trials  are  scanty  and  inconsistent.  It  is  preferable  to  include 
both  partners  in  therapy  if  the  patient  is  involved  in  an  ongoing 
relationship.

FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION
Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) has traditionally included disorders of 
desire, arousal, pain, and muted orgasm. The associated risk factors for 
FSD are similar to those in males: cardiovascular disease, endocrine dis-
orders, hypertension, neurologic disorders, and smoking (Table 397-4). 
Women  with  hypertension  report  significantly  lower  sexual  satisfac-
tion (especially younger women).

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Epidemiologic data are limited, but the available estimates suggest that 
as  many  as  43%  of  women  complain  of  at  least  one  sexual  problem. 
Despite the recent interest in organic causes of FSD, desire and arousal 
phase  disorders  (including  lubrication  complaints)  remain  the  most

population.

 ■ PHYSIOLOGY OF THE FEMALE SEXUAL RESPONSE
The normal female sexual response requires the presence of estrogens. 
A  role  for  androgens  is  also  likely  but  less  well  established.  In  the 
CNS, estrogens and androgens work synergistically to enhance sexual 
arousal and response. A number of studies report enhanced libido in 
women during preovulatory phases of the menstrual cycle, suggesting 
that hormones involved in the ovulatory surge (e.g., estrogens) increase 
desire.

Sexual  motivation  is  heavily  influenced  by  context,  including  the 
environment  and  partner  factors.  Once  sufficient  sexual  desire  is 
reached,  sexual  arousal  is  mediated  by  the  central  and  autonomic 
nervous systems. Cerebral sympathetic outflow is thought to increase 
desire, and peripheral parasympathetic activity results in clitoral vaso-
congestion and vaginal secretion (lubrication).

The neurotransmitters for clitoral corporal engorgement are similar 
to those in the male penile tissues, with a prominent role for neural, 
smooth-muscle,  and  endothelial  released  nitric  oxide  (NO).  A  fine 
network of vaginal nerves and arterioles promotes a vaginal transudate. 
The major transmitters of this complex vaginal response are not cer-
tain, but roles for NO and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are 
suspected.  Investigators  studying  the  normal  female  sexual  response 
have  challenged  the  long-held  construct  of  a  linear  and  unmitigated 
relationship  between  initial  desire,  arousal,  vasocongestion,  lubrica-
tion,  and  eventual  orgasm.  Caregivers  should  consider  a  paradigm 
of  a  positive  emotional  and  physical  outcome  with  one,  many,  or  no 
orgasmic peak and release.

Although  there  are  anatomic  differences  as  well  as  variation  in 
the  density  of  vascular  and  neural  beds  in  males  and  females,  the 
primary  effectors  of  sexual  response  are  strikingly  similar.  Intact 
sensation  is  important  for  arousal.  Thus,  reduced  levels  of  sexual 
functioning  are  more  common  in  women  with  peripheral  neurop-
athies  (e.g.,  diabetes).  Vaginal  lubrication  is  a  transudate  of  serum 
that  results  from  the  increased  pelvic  blood  flow  associated  with 
arousal. Vascular insufficiency from a variety of causes may compro-
mise adequate lubrication and result in dyspareunia. Cavernosal and 
arteriole  smooth-muscle  relaxation  occurs  via  increased  NO  syn-
thase (NOS) activity and produces engorgement in the clitoris and 
the  surrounding  vestibule.  Orgasm  requires  an  intact  sympathetic 
outflow  tract;  hence,  orgasmic  disorders  are  common  in  female 
patients with spinal cord injuries.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Female Sexual Dysfunction

Many  women  do  not  volunteer  information  about  their  sexual 
response.  Open-ended  questions  in  a  supportive  atmosphere  are 
helpful in initiating a discussion of sexual integrity in women who 
are  reluctant  to  discuss  such  issues.  Once  a  complaint  has  been 
voiced, a comprehensive evaluation should be performed, including 
a  medical  history,  a  psychosocial  history,  a  physical  examination, 
and limited laboratory testing.

The history should include the usual medical, surgical, obstetric, 
psychological,  gynecologic,  sexual,  and  social  information.  Past 
experiences,  intimacy,  knowledge,  and  partner  availability  should 
also be ascertained. Medical disorders that may affect sexual health 
should  be  delineated.  They  include  diabetes,  cardiovascular  dis-
ease, gynecologic conditions, obstetric history, depression, anxiety 
disorders, and neurologic disease. Medications should be reviewed 
as they may affect arousal, libido, and orgasm. The need for coun-
seling and recognizing life stresses should be identified. The phys-
ical examination should assess the genitalia, including the clitoris. 
Pelvic floor examination may identify prolapse or other disorders. 
Laboratory  studies  are  needed,  especially  if  menopausal  status 
is  uncertain.  Estradiol,  follicle-stimulating  hormone  (FSH),  and 

luteinizing  hormone  (LH)  are  usually  obtained,  and  dehydroepi-
androsterone  (DHEA)  should  be  considered  as  it  reflects  adrenal 
androgen  secretion.  A  CBC,  liver  function  assessment,  and  lipid 
studies  may  be  useful,  if  not  otherwise  obtained.  Complicated 
diagnostic evaluation such as clitoral Doppler ultrasonography and 
biothesiometry require expensive equipment and are of uncertain 
utility. It is important for the patient to identify which symptoms 
are most distressing.

The evaluation of FSD previously occurred exclusively in a psy-
chosocial context. However, inconsistencies between diagnostic cat-
egories based only on psychosocial considerations and the emerging 
recognition of organic etiologies have led to a new classification of 
FSD.  This  diagnostic  scheme  is  based  on  four  components  that 
are  not  mutually  exclusive:  (1)  hypoactive  sexual  desire—the  per-
sistent  or  recurrent  lack  of  sexual  thoughts  and/or  receptivity  to 
sexual  activity,  which  causes  personal  distress;  hypoactive  sexual 
desire may result from endocrine failure or may be associated with 
psychological  or  emotional  disorders,  (2)  sexual  interest  arousal 
disorder—the persistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain 
sexual  excitement,  which  causes  personal  distress,  (3)  orgasmic   
disorder—the persistent or recurrent loss of orgasmic potential after 
sufficient  sexual  stimulation  and  arousal,  which  causes  personal 
distress, and (4) sexual pain disorder—persistent or recurrent geni-
tal pain associated with noncoital sexual stimulation, which causes 
personal  distress.  This  newer  classification  emphasizes  “personal 
distress” as a requirement for dysfunction and provides clinicians 
with an organized framework for evaluation before or in conjunc-
tion with more traditional counseling methods.

TREATMENT
Female Sexual Dysfunction 

GENERAL
An  open  discussion  with  the  patient  is  important  as  couples 
may  need  to  be  educated  about  normal  anatomy  and  physiologic 
responses,  including  the  role  of  orgasm,  in  sexual  encounters. 
Physiologic changes associated with aging and/or disease should be 
explained. Couples may need to be reminded that clitoral stimula-
tion rather than coital intromission may be more beneficial.

Behavioral modification and nonpharmacologic therapies should 
be a first step. Patient and partner counseling may improve commu-
nication and relationship strains. Lifestyle changes involving known 
risk  factors  can  be  an  important  part  of  the  treatment  process. 
Emphasis  on  maximizing  physical  health  and  avoiding  lifestyles 
(e.g.,  smoking,  alcohol  abuse)  and  medications  likely  to  produce 
FSD is important (Table 397-3). The use of topical lubricants may 
address complaints of dyspareunia and dryness. Contributing med-
ications such as antidepressants may need to be altered, including 
the  use  of  medications  with  less  impact  on  sexual  function,  dose 
reduction, medication switching, or drug holidays. 

HORMONAL THERAPY
In  postmenopausal  women,  estrogen  replacement  therapy  may 
be  helpful  in  treating  vaginal  atrophy,  decreasing  coital  pain,  and 
improving  clitoral  sensitivity  (Chap.  395).  Menopause  and  its 
transition represent significant risk factors for the development of 
vulvovaginal atrophy–related sexual dysfunction. Available vaginal 
estrogen  preparations  include  conjugated  equine  estrogens,  estra-
diol vaginal cream, a sustained-release intravaginal estradiol ring, 
or  a  low-dose  estradiol  tablet.  Vaginal  estrogen  preparations  with 
the  lowest  systemic  absorption  rate  may  be  preferred  in  women 
with  history  of  breast  cancer  and  severe  vaginal  atrophy.  Vaginal 
lubricants  and  moisturizers  applied  on  a  regular  basis  have  an 
efficacy  comparable  to  that  of  local  estrogen  therapy  and  should 
be offered to women wishing to avoid the use of vaginal estrogens. 
If a hormonal supplement is chosen, then estrogen replacement in 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   3062

20/01/22   3:23 PM

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismthe  form  of  local  cream  is  the  preferred  method  as  it  avoids  sys-
temic side effects. Androgen levels in women decline substantially 
before  menopause.  However,  low  levels  of  testosterone  or  DHEA 
are not effective predictors of a positive therapeutic outcome with 
androgen  therapy.  The  widespread  use  of  exogenous  androgens 
is  not  supported  by  the  literature  except  in  select  circumstances 
(premature ovarian failure or menopausal states) and in secondary 
arousal disorders.

Atrophic  vaginitis  is  very  common  in  postmenopausal  women 
and  is  most  commonly  treated  with  estrogen-based  treatments. 
However,  many  women  are  hesitant  to  use  estrogen-based  treat-
ments due to health concerns or are unable to use them due to a his-
tory of breast cancer or endometrial cancer. Hyaluronic acid vaginal 
gel has been found to be efficacious in treating atrophic vaginitis. 

ORAL AGENTS
Flibanserin,  originally  developed  as  an  antidepressant,  has  been 
approved  by  the  FDA  as  a  treatment  for  low  sexual  desire  in 
premenopausal  women.  Flibanserin,  a  postsynaptic  agonist  of 
serotonin  receptor  1A  and  antagonist  of  serotonin  receptor  2A, 
increases  sexual  desire  and  reduces  resultant  stress  in  women 
with hyposexual desire disorder (HSDD) with few adverse effects. 
Flibanserin  has  two  principal  pharmacologic  actions  in  neural 
microcircuits:  it  acts  as  a  full  agonist  at  postsynaptic  5-HT1A 
receptors  and  an  antagonist  at  postsynaptic  5-HT2A  receptors. 
Exclusive  binding  at  these  receptors  differentiates  flibanserin 
from  buspirone  and  bupropion.  This  action  in  the  prefrontal 
cortex  causes  the  downstream  release  of  dopamine  and  norepi-
nephrine and reduction of serotonin. Flibanserin acts selectively 
on  pyramidal  neurons  that  excite  brainstem  5-HT  neurons  yet 
also selectively on pyramidal neurons that inhibit brainstem nor-
epinephrine and dopamine neurons.

Flibanserin may boost sex drive in women who experience low 
sexual  desire  and  who  find  the  experience  distressing.  The  drug 
should be discontinued if there is no improvement in sex drive after 
8 weeks. Potentially serious side effects include low blood pressure, 
dizziness,  and  fainting,  particularly  if  it  is  mixed  with  alcohol. 
Other  common  adverse  events  include  dizziness,  nausea,  fatigue, 
sleepiness, and insomnia. Health care professionals and pharmacies 
dealing with flibanserin have to undergo a certification (risk evalu-
ation and mitigation strategy [REMS]) process, and patients need to 
submit a written agreement to abstain from alcohol. The goal of the 
flibanserin REMS is to inform patients about the increased risk of 
hypotension and syncope due to an interaction with alcohol.

Bremelanotide,  a  melanocortin  4  receptor  agonist,  has  recently 
been approved for HSDD. It demonstrates significant improvement 
in  desire  and  a  significant  decrease  in  distress  related  to  lack  of 
desire. The most common adverse effects include nausea (39.9%), 
facial flushing (20.4%), and headache (11%). Bremelanotide’s place 
in  therapy  is  unknown,  as  the  trials  met  statistical  significance 
for change in sexual desire elements and distress related to sexual 
desire, yet the clinical benefit may only be modest. It is a subcuta-
neous injection given 45 min prior to sexual activity. Bremelanotide 
has  no  clinically  significant  interactions  with  ethanol.  Prescribing 
guidelines recommend no more than one dose in 24 h and no more 
than  eight  doses  per  month.  Individuals  should  discontinue  use 
after 8 weeks without benefit.

The efficacy of PDE-5is in FDS has been a marked disappoint-
ment in light of the proposed role of NO-dependent physiology in 
the  normal  female  sexual  response.  The  use  of  PDE-5is  for  FSD 
should be discouraged pending proof that they are effective. 

CLITORAL VACUUM DEVICE
In  patients  with  arousal  and  orgasmic  difficulties,  the  option  of 
using  a  clitoral  vacuum  device  may  be  explored.  This  handheld   
battery-operated  device  has  a  small  soft  plastic  cup  that  applies 
a  vacuum  over  the  stimulated  clitoris.  This  causes  increased  cav-
ernosal blood flow, engorgement, and vaginal lubrication.

398 Women’s Health

Emily Nosova, Andrea Dunaif

The  clinical  discipline  of  women’s  health  is  well  established.  Indeed, 
its  emphasis  on  greater  attention  to  patient  education  and  medical 
decision-making is a paradigm for what has become known as patient-
centered  health  care.  Moreover,  the  recognition  of  sex  differences  in 
gene expression, disease processes, and health outcomes is an impor-
tant example of precision medicine. Sex difference refers to the biologic 
differences conferred by sex chromosomes and hormones. In contrast, 
gender differences are related to psychosocial roles and cultural expec-
tations. The study of sex differences continues to grow as a scientific 
discipline.  In  2016,  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  recognized  its 
importance by implementing the expectation that sex should be con-
sidered as a biologic variable in study designs, analyses, and reporting 
in not only human but also vertebrate animal research. Strong scientific 
justification must be provided to limit research to only one sex.

DISEASE RISK: REALITY AND PERCEPTION
The leading causes of death are the same in women and men: (1) heart 
disease and (2) cancer (Fig. 398-1). The leading cause of cancer death, 
lung  cancer,  is  the  same  in  both  sexes.  Breast  cancer  is  the  second 
leading cause of cancer death in women, but it causes ~70% fewer total 
deaths than does lung cancer. Men are more likely than women to die 
from suicide and accidents.

Maternal mortality continues to be higher in the United States than 
in other industrialized nations and is associated with substantial health 
disparities in maternal deaths. U.S. maternal mortality rates declined for 
the majority of the twentieth century given improvements in maternity 
care and safer surgical techniques; however, the rates began to rise again 
in  2000.  The  most  current  national  data  for  maternal  mortality  were 
reported in 2018, over 10 years since the prior updated statistics. Over the 
past decade, the mortality rate has remained relatively stable. In 2018, the 
mortality rate was 17.4 deaths per 100,000 live births. The mortality rates 
for non-Hispanic black women were highest at 37.3 deaths per 100,000 
live births (2.5 times the rate for non-Hispanic white women [14.9 deaths 
per  100,00  live  births],  3.2  times  the  rate  for  Hispanic  women  [11.8 
deaths], and 2.8 times the rate for Asian women [13.3 deaths]).

Women’s  risk  for  many  diseases  increases  at  menopause.  The 
median  age  of  menopause  in  Caucasian  women  from  industrialized 
countries is between 50 and 52 years, where women spend one-third of 
their lives in the postmenopausal period. Menopause occurs at earlier 
ages in Hispanic and African-American women as well as in women of 
lower socioeconomic status. Estrogen levels fall abruptly at menopause, 
inducing  a  variety  of  physiologic  and  metabolic  responses.  Rates  of

second leading causes of death are the same, heart disease and cancer, respectively. Causes of death then diverge by sex. For example, accidents are the third leading 
cause of death in men but the sixth leading cause of death in women. Chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cause a larger 
percentage of deaths in women than in men. Suicide is among the 10 leading causes of death in men but not in women. (Data from SL Murphy, J Xu, KD Kochanek, E Arias,

In the United States, women live on average 5.0 years longer than 
men,  with  a  life  expectancy  at  birth  in  2018  of  81.2  years  in  women 
compared with 76.2 years in men of all races. Life expectancy was lower 
in  African  Americans  of  both  sexes  and  higher  in  Hispanics  of  both 
sexes than their Caucasian counterparts. Accordingly, elderly women 
outnumber elderly men, so that age-related conditions, such as hyper-
tension, have a female preponderance.

SEX DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH  
AND DISEASE
 ■ ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
(See also Chap. 431.) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects approximately 
twice as many women as men. Because the risk for AD increases with 
age, part of this sex difference is accounted for by the fact that women 
live  longer  than  men.  However,  even  in  relatively  younger  groups 
(60–70  years  of  age),  there  is  still  a  higher  incidence  of  AD  among 
women. Additional factors may contribute to the increased risk for AD 
in women, including sex differences in brain size, structure, and func-
tional organization. Multimodal neuroimaging has demonstrated that 
certain biomarkers of the preclinical phase of AD, including a decline 
in  neuronal  mitochondrial  function  and  impaired  cerebral  glucose 
metabolism, are evident earlier in women and are even distinguishable 
during  the  perimenopausal  endocrine  transition.  There  is  emerging 
evidence  for  sex-specific  differences  in  gene  expression,  not  only  for 
genes on the X and Y chromosomes but also for some autosomal genes. 
These  genetic  differences  may  translate  into  variable  severity  of  AD, 
with  women  experiencing  greater  deficits  in  cognition.  The  ε4  allele 
of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOε4), a cholesterol carrier integral for 
lipid transport in the brain, is a major risk factor for AD. Recent stud-
ies show that the APOε4 genotype is strongly linked to development 
of sporadic AD in women (Fig. 398-2). Women who carry either the 
APOε4 homo- or heterozygous isoform have an increased risk of pro-
gressing from healthy aging patterns to cognitive impairment or AD, 
whereas men who carry either isoform experience marginal impact on 
their memory or cognition.

Estrogens  have  pleiotropic  genomic  and  nongenomic  effects  on 
the  central  nervous  system,  including  neurotrophic  actions  in  key 
areas  involved  in  cognition  and  memory.  Women  with  AD  have 
lower endogenous estrogen levels than do women without AD. These 

observations have led to the hypothesis that estrogen is neuroprotective. 
The Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an ancillary 
study in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) in women aged ≥65 years, 
found significantly increased risk for both dementia and mild cogni-
tive impairment in women receiving estrogen alone or estrogen with 
progestin compared to placebo. However, the Kronos Early Estrogen  
Prevention  Study  (KEEPS),  a  randomized  clinical  trial  of  early  hor-
mone  therapy  (HT)  initiation  after  menopause  that  compared  con-
jugated  equine  estrogen  (CEE),  transdermal  estradiol  (both  estrogen 
arms  included  cyclic  oral  micronized  progesterone),  and  placebo, 
found  no  adverse  effect  of  HT  on  cognitive  function.  In  summary, 
there is no evidence from placebo-controlled trials that HT improves 
cognitive function.

While studies have shown a link between female sex and AD, other 
neurodegenerative  disorders,  including  Parkinson’s  disease  (PD)  and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), exhibit a stronger association with 
male  sex.  Men  are  1.5  times  more  likely  to  develop  PD  than  women 
across all age groups. A possible explanation for the male predilection 
may  be  the  effect  of  Y-chromosome  exclusive  gene  sex-determining 
region  Y  (SRY)  on  nigrostriatal  dopaminergic  (NSDA)  neurons: 
the  SRY  upregulates  neuronal  numbers,  synthesis  of  dopamine,  and 
metabolism of neurons.

ALS is a highly variable disease in symptomatology and age at onset. 
Men are diagnosed with ALS earlier in life and exhibit a more severe 
disease course, even though survival patterns are similar between the 
two  sexes.  Despite  this  variability,  epidemiologic  data  have  demon-
strated that, in females, ALS starts in the bulbar tract, whereas in males, 
ALS tends to begin in the motor neurons of the lumbar tract. Reasons 
for the sex differences observed in ALS remain unclear. However, there 
is some evidence to suggest that a more prolonged reproductive condi-
tion, defined as a longer duration exposure to estrogen via oral contra-
ceptive use versus natural menopause, may exert a neuroprotective role 
on motor neurons among women diagnosed with ALS.
 ■ CVD AND STROKE
(See also Chap. 273.) There are major sex differences in CVD, the lead-
ing cause of death in developed countries. However, there are also major 
gender  differences  because  of  perceptions  by  both  women  and  their 
health care providers that women are at lower risk for CVD. As a result of 
these misconceptions, women are less likely to seek medical help when 
they experience symptoms of CVD. Health care providers are less likely 
to suspect CVD, so women receive fewer interventions for modifiable

FIGURE  398-2  Sex  differences  and  actions  of  sex  steroid  hormones  on  amyloid  plaque  deposition,  neuroinflammation,  and  neuroprotection.  The  ε4  allele  of  the 
apolipoprotein E gene (APOε4), a cholesterol carrier integral for lipid transport in the brain, has been identified as a major genetic risk factor for the sporadic development 
of  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD).  Woman  who  carry  either  the  homo-  or  heterozygous  APOε4  isoform  have  higher  rates  of  amyloid  plaque  deposition.  The  APOε4  variant

risk factors as well as fewer acute interventions than do men. Women 
and their health care providers are also less aware that prodromal symp-
toms of cardiac disease differ in women compared to men. Women are 
less likely than men to present with chest pain and more likely to present 
with fatigue, shortness of breath, indigestion/nausea, and anxiety.

Sex  steroids  have  major  effects  on  the  cardiovascular  system  and 
lipid metabolism. Estrogen increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
and lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL), whereas androgens have the 
opposite effect. Estrogen has direct vasodilatory effects on the vascular 
endothelium,  enhances  insulin  sensitivity,  and  has  antioxidant  and 
anti-inflammatory  properties.  There  is  a  striking  increase  in  CVD 
after both natural and surgical menopause, suggesting that endogenous 
estrogens are cardioprotective. Women also have longer QT intervals 
on electrocardiograms, and this increases their susceptibility to certain 
arrhythmias.

CVD  presents  differently  in  women,  who  are  usually  10–15  years 
older than their male counterparts and are more likely to have comor-
bidities  such  as  hypertension,  congestive  heart  failure,  and  diabetes 
mellitus (DM). In the Framingham study, angina was the most com-
mon initial symptom of CVD in women, whereas myocardial infarc-
tion (MI) was the most common initial presentation in men. Women 
more  often  have  atypical  symptoms  such  as  fatigue,  anxiety,  nausea, 
indigestion, and upper back pain. Although awareness that heart dis-
ease is the leading cause of death in women has nearly doubled over 
the past 15 years, women remain less aware that its symptoms are often 

atypical and are less likely to contact 9-1-1 when they experience such 
symptoms.

Deaths  from  CVD  had  decreased  markedly  in  men  since  1980, 
whereas CVD deaths only started to decrease substantially in women 
beginning  in  2000.  After  2010,  death  rates  from  CVD  among  both 
sexes  stabilized  and  even  began  to  increase  slightly  in  men.  Women 
with MI are more likely to present with cardiac arrest or cardiogenic 
shock, whereas men are more likely to present with ventricular tachy-
cardia. Further, younger women with MI are more likely to die than are 
men of similar age. However, this mortality gap has decreased in recent 
years because younger women have experienced greater improvements 
in  survival  after  MI  than  men.  The  improvement  in  survival  is  due 
largely to a reduction in comorbidities, suggesting a greater attention 
to modifiable risk factors in women.

Sex  differences  account  for  more  variable  short-term  outcomes 
observed among women with CVD who receive therapeutic interven-
tion,  as  compared  to  men.  Women  undergoing  CABG  surgery  have 
more advanced disease, a higher perioperative mortality rate, less relief 
of angina, and less graft patency; however, 5- and 10-year survival rates 
are  similar.  Women  undergoing  percutaneous  transluminal  coronary 
angioplasty have lower rates of initial angiographic and clinical success 
than  men,  but  they  also  have  a  lower  rate  of  restenosis  and  a  better 
long-term outcome. Women may benefit less and have more frequent 
serious  bleeding  complications  from  thrombolytic  therapy  compared 
with  men.  Factors  such  as  older  age,  more  comorbid  conditions,

3066 smaller  body  size,  and  more  severe  CVD  in  women  at  the  time  of 
events or procedures account in part for the observed sex differences.

Elevated  cholesterol  levels,  hypertension,  smoking,  obesity,  low 
HDL cholesterol levels, DM, and lack of physical activity are important 
risk factors for CVD in both men and women. Total triglyceride levels 
are an independent risk factor for CVD in women but not in men. Low 
HDL cholesterol and DM are more important risk factors for CVD in 
women than in men. Several disorders affect women exclusively, such 
as pregnancy-associated hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational DM, 
and polycystic ovary syndrome, or predominantly, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis  (RA)  and  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE).  Cholester-
ol-lowering drugs are equally effective in men and women for primary 
and  secondary  prevention  of  CVD.  In  contrast  to  men,  randomized 
trials showed that aspirin was not effective in the primary prevention of 
CVD in women; it did significantly reduce the risk of ischemic stroke.
Recent  studies  demonstrate  strong  associations  between  certain 
adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) and the development of CVD in 
postmenopausal women, a risk that has been previously underappre-
ciated.  In  an  analysis  of  WHI  data,  nearly  29%  of  women  surveyed 
reported at least one APO, defined as a hypertensive disorder during 
pregnancy, low or high neonatal birth weight, gestational diabetes, or 
preterm delivery of 3 weeks or greater. Each outcome, when analyzed 
independently,  was  significantly  associated  with  the  development  of 
CVD  after  menopause.  When  multivariate  modeling  incorporated 
all of the APO variables and accounted for body mass index (BMI), 
socioeconomic status, and parity, low birth weight and hypertensive 
disorders  remained  significantly  associated  with  later-onset  CVD.  A 
recent meta-analysis examined the association of female reproductive 
factors and the development of future CVD. The greatest risk for CVD 
(at least 2-fold) was conferred by a history of stillbirth, preterm birth, 
or  preeclampsia,  followed  by  a  1.5-  to  1.9-fold  risk  with  gestational 
diabetes and hypertension, premature ovarian insufficiency, and pla-
cental abruption; the lowest risk (<1.5-fold) was associated with early 
menarche,  early  menopause,  parity,  and  polycystic  ovary  syndrome. 
Given  these  strong  associations,  targeted  counseling  and  increased 
surveillance of CVD risk factors is warranted for women in high-risk 
groups.

The  sex  differences  in  CVD  prevalence,  beneficial  biologic  effects 
of estrogen on the cardiovascular system, and reduced risk for CVD in 
observational studies led to the hypothesis that HT was cardioprotec-
tive. However, the WHI, which studied >16,000 women on CEE plus 
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or placebo and >10,000 women 
with  hysterectomy  on  CEE  alone  or  placebo,  did  not  demonstrate  a 
benefit  of  HT  for  the  primary  or  secondary  prevention  of  CVD.  In 
addition,  CEE  plus  MPA  was  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for 
CVD, particularly in the first year of therapy, whereas CEE alone nei-
ther increased nor decreased CVD risk. Both HT groups were associ-
ated with an increased risk for ischemic stroke. In a subgroup analysis 
of the WHI estrogen-alone trial, a relatively younger age (50–59 years) 
combined  with  a  history  of  bilateral  salpingo-oophorectomy  (BSO) 
was  associated  with  a  >30%  CEE  treatment–associated  reduction  in 
all-cause mortality, whereas CEE-treated older women with prior BSO 
did  not  see  a  significant  reduction  in  any  other  outcomes,  including 
incidence of coronary artery disease, invasive breast cancer, all-cause 
mortality,  and  a  composite  index  of  the  aforementioned  outcomes 
plus stroke, hip fracture, pulmonary embolism, and colorectal cancer. 
These  results  suggest  that  postmenopausal  women  younger  than  60 
with  prior  BSO  may  have  mortality  benefit  from  HT,  while  women 
older than 60 with BSO may suffer consequences associated with HT. 
More  recent  data  from  KEEPS  indicate  that  even  if  estrogen  therapy 
is initiated shortly after the menopausal transition, it does not reduce 
atherosclerotic  progression  or  impact  CVD  outcomes.  Additionally, 
HT and placebo groups have similar outcomes with respect to venous 
thromboembolism  and  breast  cancer.  Although  HT  does  not  slow 
CVD  development  as  previously  thought,  findings  from  KEEPS  sug-
gest that treated women experience significant improvements in vaso-
motor symptoms, mood, sexual function, and bone density, especially 
when therapy is started sooner after menopause onset.

HT is discussed further in Chap. 395.

 ■ DIABETES MELLITUS
(See also Chap. 403.) Women are more sensitive to insulin than men. 
Despite this, the prevalence of type 2 DM is similar in men and women. 
There  is  a  sex  difference  in  the  relationship  between  endogenous 
androgen  levels  and  DM  risk.  Higher  bioavailable  testosterone  levels 
are associated with increased risk in women, whereas lower bioavail-
able testosterone levels are associated with increased risk in men. This 
observation has been confirmed in a recent Mendelian randomization 
that  found  that  genetically  determined  higher  testosterone  increases 
risk  for  DM  in  women  but  reduces  risk  in  men.  Polycystic  ovary 
syndrome, preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertension, and ges-
tational  DM—common  conditions  in  premenopausal  women—are 
associated  with  a  significantly  increased  risk  for  type  2  DM.  Among 
individuals with DM, women have a greater risk for MI than do men. 
Women with DM have a sixfold greater risk of dying of CVD compared 
to women without DM.

Premenopausal women with DM lose the cardioprotective effect of 
female sex and have rates of CVD identical to those in males. These 
women  have  impaired  endothelial  function  and  reduced  coronary 
vasodilatory responses, which may predispose to cardiovascular com-
plications.  Women  with  DM  are  more  likely  to  have  left  ventricular 
hypertrophy.  Women  with  DM  receive  less  aggressive  treatment  for 
modifiable CVD risk factors than men with DM.

 ■ HYPERTENSION
(See also Chap. 277.) After age 60, hypertension is more common in 
U.S.  women  than  in  men,  largely  because  of  the  high  prevalence  of 
hypertension  in  older  age  groups  and  the  longer  survival  of  women. 
Isolated  systolic  hypertension  is  present  in  30%  of  women  >60  years 
old.  Sex  hormones  affect  blood  pressure.  Both  normotensive  and 
hypertensive  women  have  higher  blood  pressure  levels  during  the 
follicular  phase  than  during  the  luteal  phase.  In  the  Nurses’  Health 
Study, the relative risk of hypertension was 1.8 in current users of oral 
contraceptives, but this risk is lower with the newer low-dose contra-
ceptive preparations. HT is not associated with hypertension. Among 
secondary causes of hypertension, there is a female preponderance of 
renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia.

The  benefits  of  treatment  for  hypertension  have  been  dramatic  in 
both women and men. A meta-analysis of the effects of hypertension 
treatment, the Individual Data Analysis of Antihypertensive Interven-
tion Trial, found a reduction of risk for stroke and major cardiovascular 
events in women. The effectiveness of various antihypertensive drugs 
appears to be comparable in women and men; however, women may 
experience more side effects, such as cough with angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors.

 ■ AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS
(See also Chap. 355.) Most autoimmune disorders occur more com-
monly in women than in men; they include autoimmune thyroid and 
liver diseases, SLE, RA, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis (MS), and idio-
pathic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, there is no sex difference 
in the incidence of type 1 DM, and ankylosing spondylitis occurs more 
commonly  in  men.  Sex  differences  in  both  immune  responses  and 
adverse reactions to vaccines have been reported. For example, there is 
a female preponderance of postvaccination arthritis.

Adaptive  immune  responses  are  more  robust  in  women  than  in 
men;  this  may  be  explained  by  the  stimulatory  actions  of  estrogens 
and  the  inhibitory  actions  of  androgens  on  the  cellular  mediators 
of  immunity.  Consistent  with  an  important  role  for  sex  hormones, 
there  is  variation  in  immune  responses  during  the  menstrual  cycle, 
and the activity of certain autoimmune disorders is altered by castra-
tion  or  pregnancy  (e.g.,  RA  and  MS  may  remit  during  pregnancy). 
Nevertheless,  the  majority  of  studies  show  that  exogenous  estrogens 
and progestins in the form of HT or oral contraceptives do not alter 
autoimmune disease incidence or activity. Exposure to fetal antigens, 
including circulating fetal cells that persist in certain tissues, has been 
speculated  to  increase  the  risk  of  autoimmune  responses.  There  is 
clearly an important genetic component to autoimmunity, as indicated 
by the familial clustering and HLA association of many such disorders.

X chromosome genes also contribute to sex differences in immunity. 
Indeed, nonrandom X chromosome inactivation may be a risk factor 
for autoimmune diseases.
 ■ HIV INFECTION
(See  also  Chap.  202.)  Women  accounted  for  almost  18%  of  the 
~36,400 new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2018. Annual HIV 
diagnoses remained stable among women from 2014 to 2018. In 2018, 
the  infectivity  rate  for  black/African-American  females  was  13  times 
the  rate  for  white  females  and  4  times  higher  than  Hispanic/Latino 
females.  Nevertheless,  AIDS  remains  an  important  cause  of  death  in 
younger women, particularly African-American women aged 25–44 years. 
Heterosexual contact with an at-risk partner is the fastest-growing trans-
mission  category,  and  women  are  more  susceptible  to  HIV  infection 
during vaginal sex than men. This increased susceptibility is accounted 
for in part by an increased prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, 
i.e., gonorrhea and syphilis, in women.

Some  studies  have  suggested  that  hormonal  contraceptives  may 
increase  the  risk  of  HIV  transmission.  Progesterone  has  been  shown 
to increase susceptibility to infection in nonhuman primate models of 
HIV. Women are also more likely to be infected by multiple variants of 
the virus than men. Women with HIV have more rapid decreases in 
their CD4 cell counts than do men. Compared with men, HIV-infected 
women  more  frequently  develop  candidiasis,  but  Kaposi’s  sarcoma  is 
less common than it is in men. Women have more adverse reactions, 
such as lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, and rash, with antiretroviral ther-
apy than do men. This observation is explained in part by sex differ-
ences in the pharmacokinetics of certain antiretroviral drugs, resulting 
in higher plasma concentrations in women.
 ■ OBESITY
(See also Chap. 402.) The prevalence of both obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) 
and abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥88 cm in women) are sim-
ilar in U.S. women and men. In 2018, the age-adjusted prevalence of obe-
sity in U.S. adults was 42.4%, and there were no significant differences 
between women and men, even across different age groups. In 2018, the 
prevalence  of  obesity  was  41.9%  for  women  and  43.0%  for  men.  The 
prevalence  of  obesity  was  highest  among  non-Hispanic  black  women 
(56.9%)  as  compared  with  non-Hispanic  white  (39.8%),  Hispanic 
(43.7%), and non-Hispanic Asian women (17.2%). Non-Hispanic black 
women had a higher prevalence of obesity compared to non-Hispanic 
black men. There were no significant differences in prevalence between 
men  and  women  among  non-Hispanic  white,  non-Hispanic  Asian,  or 
Hispanic adults. More than 80% of patients who undergo bariatric sur-
gery are women. Pregnancy and menopause are risk factors for obesity.

There  are  major  sex  differences  in  body  fat  distribution.  Women 
characteristically  have  a  gluteal  and  femoral  or  gynoid  pattern  of  fat 
distribution, whereas men typically have a central or android pattern. 
Women  have  more  subcutaneous  fat  than  men.  In  women,  endoge-
nous androgen levels are positively associated with abdominal obesity, 
and androgen administration increases visceral fat. In contrast, there 
is  an  inverse  relationship  between  endogenous  androgen  levels  and 
abdominal obesity in men. Further, androgen administration decreases 
visceral fat in these obese men. The reasons for these sex differences 
in the relationship between visceral fat and androgens are unknown; 
however,  emerging  evidence  suggests  that  there  is  a  contribution  of 
genetic variation. Studies in humans also suggest that sex steroids play 
a role in modulating food intake and energy expenditure.

In men and women, abdominal obesity characterized by increased 
visceral  fat  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  CVD  and  DM. 
Obesity increases a woman’s risk for certain cancers, in particular post-
menopausal breast and endometrial cancer, in part because adipose tis-
sue provides an extragonadal source of estrogen through aromatization 
of circulating adrenal and ovarian androgens, especially the conversion 
of androstenedione to estrone. Obesity increases the risk of infertility, 
miscarriage, and complications of pregnancy.
 ■ OSTEOPOROSIS
(See also Chap. 411.) Osteoporosis is about five times more common 
in postmenopausal women than in age-matched men, and osteoporotic 

hip  fractures  are  a  major  cause  of  morbidity  in  elderly  women.  Men 
accumulate  more  bone  mass  and  lose  bone  more  slowly  than  do 
women.  Sex  differences  in  bone  mass  are  found  as  early  as  infancy. 
Calcium  intake,  vitamin  D,  and  estrogen  all  play  important  roles  in 
bone  formation  and  bone  loss.  Particularly  during  adolescence,  cal-
cium intake is an important determinant of peak bone mass. Vitamin 
D deficiency is surprisingly common in elderly women, occurring in 
>40% of women living in northern latitudes. Receptors for estrogens 
and  androgens  have  been  identified  in  bone.  Estrogen  deficiency  is 
associated with increased osteoclast activity and a decreased number of 
bone-forming units, leading to net bone loss. The aromatase enzyme, 
which converts androgens to estrogens, is also present in bone. Estro-
gen is an important determinant of bone mass in men (derived from 
the aromatization of androgens) as well as in women.
 ■ PHARMACOLOGY
On average, women have lower body weights, smaller organs, a higher 
percentage of body fat, and lower total-body water than men. There are 
also important sex differences in drug action and metabolism that are 
not accounted for by these differences in body size and composition. 
Sex steroids alter the binding and metabolism of a number of drugs. 
Further,  menstrual  cycle  phase  and  pregnancy  can  alter  drug  action. 
Women  also  take  more  medications  than  men,  including  over-the-
counter formulations and supplements. The greater use of medications 
combined with these biologic differences may account for the reported 
higher frequency of adverse drug reactions in women than in men.

Two-thirds  of  cases  of  drug-induced  torsades  des  pointes,  a  rare, 
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, occur in women because they 
have a longer, more vulnerable QT interval. These drugs, which include 
certain  antihistamines,  antibiotics,  antiarrhythmics,  and  antipsychot-
ics,  can  prolong  cardiac  repolarization  by  blocking  cardiac  voltage-
gated potassium channels.
 ■ PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS
(See  also  Chap.  452.)  Depression,  anxiety,  and  affective  and  eating 
disorders (bulimia and anorexia nervosa) are more common in women 
than in men. Epidemiologic studies from both developed and develop-
ing nations consistently find major depression to be twice as common 
in women as in men, with the sex difference becoming evident in early 
adolescence.  Depression  occurs  in  10%  of  women  during  pregnancy 
and in 10–15% of women during the postpartum period. There is a high 
likelihood  of  recurrence  of  postpartum  depression  with  subsequent 
pregnancies. The incidence of major depression diminishes after the age 
of 45 years and does not increase with the onset of menopause. Depres-
sion in women appears to have a worse prognosis than does depression 
in men; episodes last longer, and there is a lower rate of spontaneous 
remission. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders occur at equal rates in 
men and women, although there may be sex differences in symptoms.

Both biologic and social factors account for the greater prevalence of 
depressive disorders in women. Men have higher levels of the neurotrans-
mitter serotonin. Sex steroids also affect mood, and fluctuations during 
the  menstrual  cycle  have  been  linked  to  symptoms  of  premenstrual 
syndrome.  Sex  hormones  differentially  affect  the  hypothalamic-pitu-
itary-adrenal responses to stress. Testosterone appears to blunt cortisol 
responses to corticotropin-releasing hormone. Both low and high levels 
of estrogen can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
 ■ COVID-19 INFECTION
(See also Chap. 199.) Soon after the discovery of COVID-19, which 
was  identified  in  November  2019  in  Wuhan,  China,  as  being  caused 
by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, it was evident that there were 
appreciable  sex  differences  in  severity  and  outcomes.  Indeed,  initial 
observational data from the winter of 2019 and spring of 2020 demon-
strated a higher overall incidence of infectious cases, hospitalizations, 
intensive  care  unit  admissions,  and  case-fatality  rates  among  men  as 
compared to women. More pronounced sex differences were observed 
with advanced age, with a higher overall incidence in older male age 
groups.  These  sex  differences  have  persisted  among  different  racial, 
ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and across all continents, as SARS-
CoV-2 became a global pandemic.

There  are  several  potential  mecha-
nisms  for  these  sex-specific  effects  of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus’s entry 
point into cells is the membrane-bound 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
receptor, and it also harnesses the primer 
TMPRSS2,  a  cellular  serine  protease 
(Fig. 398-3). Circulating levels of ACE2, 
which is expressed in a variety of tissues 
including  the  lung,  heart,  and  kidneys, 
have been reported to be relatively higher 
in  men  who  have  diabetes  and/or  kid-
ney  disease,  as  well  as  in  healthy  men; 
however,  not  all  studies  have  reported 
similar  sex  differences.  One  hypothesis 
is that upregulation of the ACE2 receptor 
in men may provide greater opportunity 
for  cellular  entry,  viral  replication,  and 
development  of  symptoms  and  deleteri-
ous sequelae.

protease, TMPRSS2, is also vital for host cell entry. Circulating levels of ACE2, expressed abundantly in the lung, heart, 
and kidney tissues, have been reported to be relatively higher in men. Upregulation of the ACE2 receptor in men may 
provide  greater  opportunity  for  cellular  entry,  viral  replication,  symptom  development,  and  multiorgan  involvement.

ACE2 plays a critical role in bronchial 
transient  secretory  cells/type  II  alveolar 
cells as well as the renin-angiotensin-al-
dosterone system (RAAS). In the RAAS, 
ACE2 opposes angiotensin II’s vasocon-
strictive actions by converting angioten-
sin II to the vasodilatory angiotensin 1-7 
in critical tissues, including cardiac myo-
cytes,  cardiac  fibroblasts,  and  coronary 
endothelial cells. Importantly, recent evi-
dence  has  shown  the  impact  of  sex  and 
sex  hormones  on  the  RAAS  and  ACE2: 
estrogen  downregulates  angiotensin  II 
receptor type 1 and regulates renin activ-
ity,  as  well  as  modulates  local  RAAS  in 
the atrial myocardium. Furthermore, it has been shown that ovariec-
tomized females have increased ACE2 activity and expression in their 
kidney and adipose tissue and that estradiol replacement reduces ACE2 
expression.  On  the  contrary,  orchiectomized  males  have  decreased 
ACE2  activity.  Estrogen  appears  to  reduce  ACE2  expression  in  the 
heart and kidney in both rodent and human studies.

TMPRSS2, a vital contributor to SARS-CoV-2 cellular invasion, is a 
protein that is most abundantly expressed in prostate epithelial tissue, 
including high-grade prostate cancers and metastases. Accordingly, the 
protein’s  involvement  in  viral  priming  is  thought  to  be  an  important 
reason for the higher case-fatality rate observed in men; however, the 
association  has  not  yet  been  proven.  TMPRSS2  is  also  expressed  in 
airway  epithelia,  where  its  physiologic  function  is  not  entirely  clear. 
Transcription  of  the  cellular  protein  is  regulated  by  androgenic  lig-
ands and androgen receptor binding element; it is unknown whether 
estrogen plays a role in its regulation. Emerging in vitro studies have 
demonstrated that a TMPRSS2 inhibitor blocks viral entry into cells. 
These data may serve as an important foundation for sex-specific and 
personalized therapeutic approaches in the future.

 ■ SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND TOBACCO
(See also Chaps. 453 and 454.) Substance abuse is more common in 
men  than  in  women.  However,  one-third  of  Americans  who  suffer 
from  alcoholism  are  women.  Women  are  less  likely  to  be  diagnosed 
with alcoholism than men. A greater proportion of men than women 
seek help for alcohol and drug abuse. Men are more likely to go to an 
alcohol or drug treatment facility, whereas women tend to approach a 
primary  care  physician  or  mental  health  professional  for  help  under 
the  guise  of  a  psychosocial  problem.  Blood  alcohol  levels  are  higher 
in  women  than  in  men  after  drinking  equivalent  amounts  of  alco-
hol,  adjusted  for  body  weight.  This  greater  bioavailability  of  alcohol 
in  women  is  due  to  both  the  smaller  volume  of  distribution  and  the 
slower  gastric  metabolism  of  alcohol  secondary  to  lower  activity  of 
gastric  alcohol  dehydrogenase  than  is  the  case  in  men.  Women  with 

alcoholism have a higher mortality rate than do women and men with-
out alcoholism. Women also appear to develop alcoholic liver disease 
and other alcohol-related diseases with shorter drinking histories and 
lower levels of alcohol consumption. Alcohol abuse also poses special 
risks to a woman, adversely affecting fertility and the health of the baby 
(fetal alcohol syndrome). Even moderate alcohol use increases the risk 
of breast cancer, hypertension, and stroke in women.

More men than women smoke tobacco, but this sex difference contin-
ues to decrease. Women have a much larger burden of smoking-related 
disease. Smoking markedly increases the risk of CVD in premenopausal 
women and is also associated with a decrease in the age of menopause. 
Women who smoke are more likely to develop chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease and lung cancer than men and at lower levels of tobacco 
exposure. Postmenopausal women who smoke have lower bone density 
than women who never smoked. Smoking during pregnancy increases 
the risk of preterm deliveries and low birth weight infants.

 ■ VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
More than one in four women in the United States have experienced 
rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner. Adult 
women are much more likely to be raped by a spouse, ex-spouse, or 
acquaintance than by a stranger. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a 
leading cause of death among young women. Rates of reported IPV 
in the United States increased dramatically amid stay-at-home orders 
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  IPV  is  an  important  risk  factor 
for  depression,  substance  abuse,  and  suicide  in  women.  Screening 
instruments  can  accurately  identify  women  experiencing  IPV  and 
should be administered in settings that ensure adequate privacy and  
safety.

SUMMARY
Women’s  health  is  now  a  mature  discipline,  and  the  importance  of 
sex differences in biologic processes is well recognized. Nevertheless, 
ongoing misperceptions about disease risk, not only among women but

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismalso among their health care providers, result in inadequate attention to 
modifiable risk factors. Research into the fundamental mechanisms of 
sex differences will provide important biologic insights. Furthermore, 
those insights will have an impact on both women’s and men’s health.

399 Men’s Health

Shalender Bhasin

The emergence of men’s health as a distinct discipline within internal 
medicine is founded on the wide consensus that men and women differ 
across  their  life  span  in  their  susceptibility  to  disease,  in  the  clinical 
manifestations of the disease, and in their response to treatment. Fur-
thermore,  men  and  women  weigh  the  health  consequences  of  illness 
differently  and  have  different  motivation  for  seeking  care.  Men  and 
women experience different types of disparities in access to health care 
services and in the manner in which health care is delivered to them 
because of a complex array of socioeconomic and cultural factors. Atti-
tudinal and institutional barriers to accessing care, fear and embarrass-
ment due to the perception that it is not manly to seek medical help, 
and reticence on the part of patients and physicians in discussing issues 
related to sexuality, drug use, and aging have heightened the need for 
programs tailored to address the specific health needs of men.

The sex differences in disease prevalence, susceptibility, and clinical 
manifestations  of  the  disease  were  discussed  in  Chap.  398  (Women’s 
Health) and will not be discussed here. It is notable that the two leading 
causes of death in both men and women—heart disease and cancer—are 
the same. However, men have higher prevalence of neurodevelopmental 
and degenerative disorders, substance use disorders, including the use 
of  performance-enhancing  drugs  and  alcohol  dependence,  diabetes, 
and  cardiovascular  disease,  and  women  have  a  higher  prevalence 
of  autoimmune  disorders,  depression,  rheumatologic  disorders,  and 
osteoporosis. Men are substantially more likely to die from accidents, 
suicides, and homicides than women. Among men 15–34 years of age, 
unintentional injuries, homicides, and suicides account for over three-
fourths  of  all  deaths.  Among  men  35–64  years  of  age,  heart  disease, 
cancer,  and  unintentional  injuries  are  the  leading  causes  of  death. 
Among men ≥65 years of age, heart disease, cancer, lower respiratory 
tract infections, and stroke are the major causes of death.

From  1999  to  2010,  the  mortality  rates  in  the  United  States 
decreased for men and women of all age groups, largely due to reduced 
death rates from heart attacks, cancer, motor vehicle injuries, and HIV 
infection.  However,  during  the  past  decade,  troubling  disparities  in 
sex-specific mortality rates have emerged among middle-aged men in 
the United States. From 2010 to 2017, the death rates have risen and 
life  expectancy  has  decreased  for  young  and  middle-aged  men.  The

increase in mortality rates among people aged 25–64 was the highest 
in the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, and in the New England states of 
New  Hampshire,  Maine,  and  Vermont.  The  rising  mortality  rates  in  
young  and  middle-aged  men  have  been  attributed  to  an  increase  in 
deaths due to drug overdose, alcohol-related liver disease, and suicide. 
The rising rates of “deaths of despair” among young and middle-aged 
men, especially white non-Hispanics, have been associated with dete-
rioration in economic and social well-being, reduced rates of marriage 
and labor force participation, and poor physical and mental health.

The biologic bases of sex differences in disease susceptibility, pro-
gression,  and  manifestation  remain  incompletely  understood  and 
are  likely  multifactorial.  Undoubtedly,  sex-specific  differences  in  the 
genetic  architecture  and  circulating  sex  hormones  influence  disease 
phenotype;  additionally,  epigenetic  effects  of  sex  hormones  during 
fetal  life,  early  childhood,  and  pubertal  development  may  epigeneti-
cally imprint sexual and nonsexual behaviors, body composition, and 
disease susceptibility. The circulating and tissue concentrations of sex 
hormones differ substantially in men and women, and these hormonal 
differences may affect gene expression in cells of males and females in 
all parts of the body. The presence of only one X chromosome in men 
renders them more susceptible to X-linked disorders than women. Due 
to the X inactivation of one randomly chosen X chromosome, women’s 
bodies contain two epigenetically different cell populations. The genes 
that do not undergo X inactivation exhibit dosage differences between 
male and female cells. Expression of the Y chromosome genes in men 
may affect the function of somatic cells containing the Y chromosome. 
The differences in the imprinting of maternally and paternally derived 
genes may also contribute to sex differences in the expression of dis-
ease.  Reproductive  load  and  physiologic  changes  during  pregnancy, 
including profound hormonal and metabolic shifts and microchime-
rism (transfer of cells from the mother to the fetus and from the fetus 
to the mother), may affect disease susceptibility and disease severity in 
women. Sociocultural norms of child-rearing practices, societal expec-
tations  of  gender  roles,  and  the  long-term  economic  impact  of  these 
practices and gender roles influence health behaviors and disease risk. 
Furthermore, the trajectories of age-related changes in sex hormones 
during the reproductive and postreproductive years vary substantially 
between  men  and  women  and  influence  the  sex-specific  patterns  of 
the temporal evolution of age-related conditions such as osteoporosis, 
breast cancer, and autoimmune disease.

In  a  reflection  of  the  growing  attention  on  issues  related  to  men’s 
health,  men’s  health  clinics  have  mushroomed  all  over  the  country. 
Although  the  major  threats  to  men’s  health  have  not  changed—heart 
disease, cancer, and unintentional injury continue to dominate the list 
of major medical causes of morbidity and mortality in men—the men 
who attend men’s health clinics do so largely for sexual, reproductive, 
and  urologic  health  concerns  involving  common  conditions,  such  as 
androgen deficiency syndromes, age-related decline in testosterone lev-
els,  sexual  dysfunction,  muscle  dysmorphia  and  anabolic-androgenic 
steroid (AAS) use, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and medical 
complications  of  prostate  cancer  therapy,  which  are  the  subjects  of 
this  chapter.  Additionally,  we  are  witnessing  the  emergence  of  new 
categories  of  body  image  disorders  in  men  that  had  not  been  recog-
nized  until  the  1980s,  such  as  the  body  dysmorphia  syndrome  and 
the use of performance-enhancing drugs to increase muscularity and 
lean appearance. Although menopause has been the subject of intense 
investigation for more than five decades, these issues that are specific to 
men’s health are just beginning to gain the attention that they deserve 
because  of  their  high  prevalence  and  impact  on  overall  health,  well- 
being, and quality of life.
AGING-RELATED CHANGES IN MALE 
REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION
A  number  of  cross-sectional  and  longitudinal  studies  (e.g.,  the  
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the Framingham Heart Study 
[FHS], the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, and the European Male 
Aging  Study  [EMAS])  have  established  that  testosterone  concentra-
tions  decrease  with  advancing  age.  This  age-related  decline  starts  in 
the  third  decade  of  life  and  progresses  slowly  (Fig.  399-1);  the  rate

of  decline  in  testosterone  concentrations  is  greater  in  obese  men,  in 
men  with  chronic  illness,  and  in  those  taking  medications  than  in 
healthy  older  men.  Because  sex  hormone–binding  globulin  (SHBG) 
concentrations are higher in older men than in younger men, free or 
bioavailable testosterone concentrations decline with aging to a greater 
extent than total testosterone concentrations. The age-related decline 
in testosterone is due to defects at all levels of the hypothalamic-pitu-
itary-testicular (HPT) axis: pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
(GnRH) secretion is attenuated, luteinizing hormone (LH) response to 
GnRH is reduced, and testicular response to LH is impaired. However, 
the gradual rise of LH with aging suggests that testis dysfunction is the 
main cause of declining androgen levels. The magnitude and trajectory 
of  age-related  decline  in  testosterone  levels  are  affected  by  adiposity 
and  weight  change,  comorbid  conditions,  and  genetic  factors.  In  the 
EMAS, 2.1% of community-dwelling men aged 40–70 years had total 
testosterone levels <317 ng/dL and a free testosterone level of <64 pg/
mL, as well as sexual symptoms.

In  epidemiologic  surveys,  low  total  and  bioavailable  testosterone 
concentrations  in  middle-aged  and  older  men  have  been  associated 
with  decreased  sexual  desire,  poor  erections,  and  diminished  early 
morning  erections;  lower  appendicular  skeletal  muscle  mass,  muscle 
strength, and self-reported physical function; increased risk of mobil-
ity  limitation  and  falls;  higher  visceral  fat  mass,  insulin  resistance, 
and type 2 diabetes; reduced telomere length and increased all-cause 
and  cardiovascular  mortality;  lower  areal  and  volumetric  bone  min-
eral  density  and  bone  quality;  and  higher  rates  of  bone  fractures  
(Table  399-1).  Hypogonadal  men  often  report  low  mood.  However, 
testosterone  levels  have  not  been  consistently  associated  with  major 
depressive  disorder;  rather,  low  testosterone  levels  are  more  robustly 
associated  with  late-onset,  low-grade,  persistent  depressive  disorder 
previously referred to as dysthymia. An analysis of signs and symptoms 
in older men in the EMAS revealed a syndromic association of sexual 
symptoms  with  total  testosterone  levels  <320  ng/dL  and  free  testos-
terone  levels  <64  pg/mL  in  community-dwelling  older  men.  Neither 
testosterone nor dihydrotesterone levels are associated with the risk of 
prostate cancer or LUTS.

Mendelian randomization studies using data from the United Kingdom 
Biobank Study found a sexual dimorphic relation between genetically 
determined testosterone levels and the risk of type 2 diabetes; in men, 
lower genetically determined testosterone levels were associated with 
higher risk of type 2 diabetes, but in women, higher genetically deter-
mined  testosterone  levels  were  associated  with  higher  risk  of  type  2 
diabetes.  Higher  genetically  determined  testosterone  levels  were  also 
associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in men in this study.

Among  the  small  number  of  randomized  trials  that  have  evaluated 
the  efficacy  of  testosterone  treatment  in  older  men,  the  Testosterone 
Trials  (TTrials)—a  set  of  seven  coordinated  placebo-controlled  trials  of 
testosterone  replacement  conducted  in  788  community-dwelling  older 
men  aged  65  years  or  older,  who  had  an  average  of  two  morning, 
fasting total testosterone levels, measured using liquid chromatography– 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), <275 ng/dL—have provided the  
most  comprehensive  data  on  the  efficacy  of  testosterone  treatment. 
The eligible men in the TTrials were required to have one or more of 
the  following:  low  sexual  desire,  mobility  limitation,  and/or  fatigue, 
and they were allocated using minimization to receive either placebo 
gel  or  testosterone  gel  for  1  year.  Testosterone  treatment  was  associ-
ated with greater improvement in overall sexual activity, sexual desire, 
erectile function, and satisfaction with sexual experience than placebo  
(Table 399-2). Testosterone treatment improved volumetric as well as 
areal bone density and estimated bone strength more than placebo; the 
improvements  in  volumetric  bone  density  in  the  spine  were  greater 
than in the hip and greater in the trabecular than the peripheral bone. 
Testosterone treatment also corrected anemia in a greater proportion 
of older men with unexplained anemia of aging than placebo. No trials 
have  been  large  enough  or  long  enough  to  determine  the  long-term 
benefits of testosterone treatment in older men on clinically important 
outcomes  such  as  disability,  fractures,  progression  from  prediabetes 
to  diabetes,  remission  of  dysthymia,  and  progression  to  Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) in men at risk of AD.

Testosterone therapy of healthy older men with low or low-normal 
testosterone levels is associated with greater increments in lean body 
mass,  grip  strength,  and  some  measures  of  physical  function  than 
those associated with placebo (Fig. 399-2). In the TTrials, testosterone 
therapy of older hypogonadal men with self-reported mobility limita-
tion consistently improved self-reported walking ability and modestly 
improved  6-min  walking  distance  across  all  TTtrials  participants 
but  did  not  affect  falls.  Testosterone  treatment  of  hypogonadal  men 
without a depressive disorder has been associated with a small but sig-
nificantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared to 
placebo; however, testosterone treatment alone or as an adjunct to anti-
depressant pharmacologic therapy has not been found to be efficacious 
in major depressive disorder. Two small, randomized trials in men with 
late-onset, low-grade persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) have 
reported  improvements  in  depressive  symptoms  in  dysthymic  men 
with low testosterone levels. In a large randomized trial (T4DM Trial) 
in  men  aged  50–74  years  without  hypogonadism,  who  had  a  waist 
circumference  of  ≥95  cm  and  impaired  glucose  tolerance  or  newly 
diagnosed type 2 diabetes, testosterone treatment in conjunction with

Testosterone treatment, compared

their hemoglobin by ≥1.0 g/dL and 
correcting their anemia.
Testosterone treatment did not 
improve delayed paragraph recall,

Testosterone treatment increased 
vBMD of the trabecular as well as 
peripheral bone in the spine and 
hip and increased estimated bone 
strength in the spine and hip more 
than placebo.
Testosterone treatment was 
associated with greater increase 
in the volume of noncalcified 
plaque in the coronary arteries 
than placebo.

Note: The TTrials were a set of seven coordinated placebo-controlled trials whose 
primary goal was to determine whether testosterone treatment for 1 year of men 
aged 65 years or older with an average of two morning, fasting total testosterone 
levels <275 ng/dL plus one or more of three conditions (low sexual desire, mobility 
limitation, and/or low vitality) was more efficacious than placebo in improving 
sexual function, mobility, and/ or vitality. The other four linked trials evaluated the 
effects of testosterone treatment on volumetric bone mineral density, anemia, 
cognitive function, and coronary artery plaque volume.

a lifestyle program for 2 years reduced the proportion of participants 
with type 2 diabetes more than placebo plus lifestyle program. Testos-
terone therapy has not been shown to improve fracture risk, cognitive 
function, or response to phosphodiesterase inhibitors in older men.

Neither the long-term risks nor the clinical benefits of testosterone 
therapy in older men have been demonstrated in adequately powered 
trials. Erythrocytosis is the most frequent adverse event associated with 
testosterone  treatment.  While  there  is  no  evidence  that  testosterone 
causes prostate cancer, there is concern that testosterone therapy might 
cause subclinical prostate cancers to grow. Testosterone therapy is asso-
ciated with increased risk of detection of prostate events. Testosterone 
does  not  worsen  LUTS  in  older  men  who  do  not  have  severe  LUTS 
prior to treatment.

There  is  no  clear  evidence  that  testosterone  treatment  increases 
the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). No random-
ized trial to date has been long enough or large enough to determine 
whether  testosterone  increases  the  risk  of  MACE.  In  two  placebo-
controlled trials, the rates of atherosclerosis progression did not differ 
significantly between the testosterone and placebo groups. In the Car-
diovascular Trial of the TTrials, testosterone treatment was associated 
with a greater increase in the volume of the noncalcified plaque, com-
pared to placebo. A large randomized trial to determine the effects of 
testosterone replacement therapy on MACE in middle-aged and older 
hypogonadal men aged 45–85 years (TRAVERSE Trial, ClincalTrials.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Older Men with Age-Related Decline in Testosterone

Population screening of all older men for low testosterone levels is 
not  recommended;  testing  should  be  restricted  to  men  who  have 
symptoms or physical features attributable to androgen deficiency. 
Testosterone  treatment  of  older  men  with  symptomatic  testoster-
one  deficiency  offers  some  clinical  benefits  (e.g.,  improvement  of 
sexual  symptoms  in  men  with  low  libido,  correction  of  anemia), 
but because of the lack of evidence of long-term safety and limited 
evidence  of  long-term  efficacy,  an  expert  panel  of  the  Endocrine 
Society  recommended  against  testosterone  treatment  of  all  older 
men  with  low  testosterone  levels.  Instead,  the  expert  panel  rec-
ommended  that  “testosterone  therapy  should  be  offered  on  an

FIGURE 399-3  An individualized, patient-centric approach to shared treatment decision-making in older men with testosterone deficiency. Testosterone treatment is not 
indicated in all older men with low testosterone levels. The decision to treat should be individualized based on considerations of the severity of testosterone deficiency, the 
burden of symptoms and conditions associated with testosterone deficiency, the presence of conditions that might increase the patient’s risk of harm from testosterone 
treatment, and the patient’s values and willingness to accept the uncertainty of the long-term benefits and risks and the burden of treatment and monitoring. TRT, testosterone

individualized basis . . . in men >65 years who have symptoms or 
conditions suggestive of testosterone deficiency (e.g., low libido or 
unexplained anemia) and consistently low testosterone.” The deci-
sion to offer testosterone treatment to older men with low testoster-
one levels should be a shared decision, guided by an individualized 
assessment  of  potential  benefits  and  risks,  and  careful  weighing 
of  the  burden  of  symptoms/conditions  against  the  potential  ben-
efits and risks (Fig. 399-3). Evaluate whether the patient has clear 
evidence  of  testosterone  deficiency.  The  diagnosis  of  testosterone 
deficiency should be made on the basis of two or more early morn-
ing, fasting testosterone levels below the lower limit of normal for 
healthy  young  men  plus  the  presence  of  symptoms.  Weigh  the 
burden of symptoms/conditions against the known benefits and the 
uncertainty of long-term harm. Ascertain whether the patient has 
any conditions that might increase the risk of harm, such as prostate 
cancer,  severe  LUTS,  erythrocytosis,  or  deep-venous  thrombo-
sis.  Older  men  considering  testosterone  supplementation  should 
undergo baseline evaluation of risk factors for prostate cancer. The 
initiation of prostate screening and monitoring should be a shared 
decision because prostate cancer screening has some risks. A shared 
decision to treat should be accompanied by a standardized moni-
toring plan to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio.

increasing steadily across the world; postponement of childbirth to an 
older age increases the risk of involuntary childlessness because of the 
adverse  effects  of  advanced  maternal  and  paternal  age  on  fecundity, 
increased risk of comorbidities that may indirectly affect fecundity, and 
the age-related changes in reproductive behaviors. Increased paternal 
age  is  associated  with  increased  risk  of  germline  mutations  in  the 
FGFR2,  FGFR3,  and  RET  genes  and  the  associated  autosomal  domi-
nant  diseases,  such  as  achondroplasia,  Pfeiffer’s  syndrome,  Crouzon’s 
syndrome, Apert’s syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, 
and MEN 2B. Advanced paternal age also increases the risk of Klinefel-
ter’s syndrome, trisomy 13 and 18, neurodevelopmental disorders such 
as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorders, and cardiac malformations 
such as ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent duc-
tus arteriosus.
Sexual  Dysfunction  Various  forms  of  sexual  dysfunction  are  a 
major motivating factor for men seeking care at men’s health clinics. 
The  landmark  descriptions  of  the  human  sexual  response  cycle  by 
Masters  and  Johnson  demonstrating  that  men  and  women  display 
predictable physiologic responses after sexual stimulation provided the 
basis for rational classification of human sexual disorders. Accordingly, 
sexual disorders have been classified into four categories depending on 
phase of sexual response cycle in which the abnormality exists:

AGE-RELATED CHANGES IN FECUNDITY
Although  testicular  morphology,  semen  production,  and  fertility  are 
maintained  up  to  a  very  old  age  in  men,  advanced  paternal  age  is  a 
risk  factor  for  reduced  fertility.  Compared  to  men  aged  21–25  years, 
men >50 years old have lower sperm motility and sperm morphology, 
a  higher  frequency  of  sperm  tail  defects,  and  lower  fecundity.  The 
fecundity  is  reduced  when  both  parents  are  >40  years  old.  Increased 
workforce participation and changing career expectations of women, a 
higher age at reproductive union, and the availability of contraceptives 
that enable couples to separate their sexual and procreative lives have 
underpinned powerful secular trends toward postponement of child-
bearing  to  an  older  age.  The  median  age  at  first  childbirth  has  been 

1.  Hypoactive sexual desire disorder
2.  Erectile dysfunction
3.  Ejaculatory and orgasmic disorders
4.  Disorders of pain

Classification of the patient’s disorder into these categories is impor-
tant as the etiologic factors, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic strategies 
vary for each class of sexual disorder. Historically, the classification and 
nomenclature  for  sexual  disorders  were  based  on  the  Diagnostic  and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), based on the erroneous 
belief that sexual disorders in men are largely psychogenic in origin. 
However, the recognition of erectile dysfunction as a manifestation of 
systemic disease and the availability of easy-to-use oral selective phos-
phodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors have placed sexual disorders in men

within the purview of the primary care provider. These disorders have 
been discussed in Chap. 397 (Sexual Dysfunction).

 ■ MUSCLE DYSMORPHIA SYNDROME IN MEN—A 
FORM OF BODY IMAGE DISORDER
Muscle dysmorphia is a form of body image disorder characterized by 
a  pathologic  preoccupation  with  muscularity  and  leanness.  The  men 
with muscle dysmorphia express a strong desire to be more muscular 
and lean. These men describe shame and embarrassment about their 
body size and shape and often report aversive symptoms such as dissat-
isfaction with appearance, preoccupation with bodybuilding and mus-
cularity, and functional impairment. Patients with muscle dysmorphia 
also report higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders and obsessive 
and compulsive behaviors than individuals with no history of muscle 
dysmorphia.  These  men  often  experience  impairment  of  social  and 
occupational functioning.

Patients  with  muscle  dysmorphia  syndrome—nearly  all  men—are 
almost  always  engaged  in  weightlifting  and  body  building  and  are 
more  likely  to  use  performance-enhancing  drugs,  especially  AASs, 
than  men  in  the  general  population  or  even  weightlifters  without 
body  dysmorphia.  Muscle  dysmorphia  disorder  exposes  men  to  an 
increased risk of disease due to the combined interactive effects of the 
intensity of physical exercise, the use of performance-enhancing drugs, 
and other lifestyle factors associated with weightlifting and the use of  
performance-enhancing  drugs.  These  patients  are  also  at  increased 
risk of functioning poorly in their occupation and social life than men 
without this disorder. No randomized trials of any treatment modali-
ties have been conducted; anecdotally, behavioral and cognitive thera-
pies have been tried with varying degrees of success.

AAS Abuse by Athletes and Recreational Bodybuilders  The 
illicit use of AASs to enhance athletic performance first surfaced in the 
1950s among powerlifters and spread rapidly to other sports, profes-
sional as well as high school athletes, and recreational bodybuilders. In 
the early 1980s, the use of AAS spread beyond the athletic community 
into  the  general  population.  As  many  as  3  million  Americans—most 
of them men—have likely used these compounds. Most AAS users are 
not athletes, but rather recreational weightlifters who use these drugs 
to look lean and more muscular.

The  most  commonly  used  AASs  include  testosterone  esters,  nan-
drolone,  stanozolol,  methandienone,  and  methenolol.  AAS  users 
generally use increasing doses of multiple steroids in a practice known 
as stacking.

The adverse effects of long-term AAS abuse remain poorly under-
stood. Most of the information about the adverse effects of AAS has 
emerged from case reports, uncontrolled studies, or clinical trials that 
used  replacement  doses  of  testosterone  (Table  399-3).  The  adverse 
event data from clinical trials using physiologic replacement doses of 
testosterone  have  been  extrapolated  unjustifiably  to  AAS  users  who 
may  administer  10–100  times  the  replacement  doses  of  testosterone 
over many years and to support the claim that AAS use is safe. A sub-
stantial fraction of AAS users also use other drugs that are perceived 
to  be  muscle-building  or  performance-enhancing,  such  as  growth 
hormone;  erythropoiesis-stimulating  agents;  insulin;  stimulants  such 
as amphetamine, clenbuterol, cocaine, ephedrine, and thyroxine; and 
drugs  perceived  to  reduce  adverse  effects  such  as  human  chorionic 
gonadotropin  (hCG),  aromatase  inhibitors,  or  estrogen  antagonists. 
Men  who  abuse  AAS  are  more  likely  to  engage  in  other  high-risk 
behaviors than nonusers. The adverse events associated with AAS use 
may be due to AAS themselves, concomitant use of other drugs, high-
risk behaviors, and host characteristics that may render these individu-
als more susceptible to AAS use or to other high-risk behaviors.

The high rates of mortality and morbidities observed in AAS users 
are alarming. One Finnish study reported 4.6 times the risk of death 
among elite power lifters than in age-matched men from the general 
population. The causes of death among power lifters included suicides, 
myocardial  infarction,  hepatic  coma,  and  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma. 
A  retrospective  review  of  patient  records  in  Sweden  also  reported 
higher standardized mortality ratios for AAS users than for nonusers.

Studies  indicate  that  32%  of  deaths  among  AAS  users  were  suicidal, 
26% homicidal, and 35% accidental. The median age of death among 
AAS users—24 years—is even lower than that for heroin or amphet-
amine users.

Numerous  reports  of  cardiac  death  among  young  AAS  users  raise 
concerns about the adverse cardiovascular effects of AAS. High doses 
of AAS may induce proatherogenic dyslipidemia, increase thrombosis 
risk  via  effects  on  clotting  factors  and  platelets,  induce  vasospasm 
through their effects on vascular nitric oxide, and induce myocardial 
hypertrophy and fibrosis.

Replacement doses of testosterone, when administered parenterally, 
are  associated  with  only  a  small  decrease  in  high-density  lipoprotein 
(HDL)  cholesterol  and  little  or  no  effect  on  total  cholesterol,  low- 
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. In con-
trast, supraphysiologic doses of testosterone and orally administered, 
17-α-alkylated,  nonaromatizable  AAS  are  associated  with  marked 
reductions in HDL cholesterol and increases in LDL cholesterol.

Recent studies of AAS users using tissue Doppler and strain imag-
ing  and  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  have  reported  diastolic 
and  systolic  dysfunction,  including  significantly  lower  early  and  late 
diastolic tissue velocities, reduced E/A ratio, and reduced peak systolic 
strain in AAS users than in nonusers. Power athletes using AAS often 
have short QT intervals but increased QT dispersion, which may pre-
dispose them to ventricular arrhythmias. Long-term AAS use may be 
associated with myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. Myocardial tissue 
of power lifters using AAS has been shown to be infiltrated with fibrous 
tissue and fat droplets. AAS users demonstrate higher coronary artery 
plaque volume than nonusers, and lifetime AAS dose is associated with 
coronary atherosclerotic burden.

Long-term AAS use suppresses LH and follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH) secretion and inhibits endogenous testosterone production and 
spermatogenesis. Men who have used AAS for more than a few months 
experience  marked  suppression  of  the  HPT  axis  after  stopping  AAS

3074 that may be associated with sexual dysfunction, fatigue, infertility, and 
depressive symptoms. In some AAS users, HPT suppression may last 
more than a year, and in a few individuals, complete recovery may not 
occur. The symptoms of androgen deficiency during AAS withdrawal 
may cause some men to revert back to using AAS, leading to contin-
ued use and AAS dependence. As many as 30% of AAS users develop 
a syndrome of AAS dependence, characterized by long-term AAS use 
despite adverse medical and psychiatric effects. In some men’s health 
clinics, as many as 25% of young men receiving testosterone replace-
ment therapy have anabolic steroid withdrawal hypogonadism.

Supraphysiologic  doses  of  testosterone  may  also  impair  insulin 
sensitivity.  Orally  administered  androgens  have  been  associated  with 
insulin resistance and diabetes.

Unsafe injection practices, high-risk behaviors, and increased rates 
of incarceration render AAS users at increased risk of HIV and hepati-
tis B and C. In one survey, nearly 1 in 10 gay men had injected AAS or 
other substances, and AAS users were more likely to report high-risk 
unprotected anal sex than other men.

Some AAS users develop hypomanic and manic symptoms during 
AAS exposure (irritability, aggressiveness, reckless behavior, and occa-
sional psychotic symptoms, sometimes associated with violence) and 
major depression (sometimes associated with suicidality) during AAS 
withdrawal.  Users  may  also  develop  other  forms  of  illicit  drug  use, 
which may be potentiated or exacerbated by AAS.

AAS  use  has  been  associated  with  difficulties  with  spatial  as  well 
as  working  memory,  problem  solving,  and  attention,  and  structural 
and functional changes in many brain regions involved in inhibitory 
control and emotional regulation. A structural MRI study of users of 
high  doses  of  AAS  reported  smaller  cortical,  gray  matter,  putamen, 
and corpus callosum volumes. Both low and high androgen levels have 
been  associated  with  increased  Aβ  and  tau-P  levels  and  Aβ  toxicity. 
These data have raised concern that long-term AAS use may increase 
the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.

Elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic neoplasms, and 
peliosis hepatis have been reported with oral, 17-α-alkylated AAS. AAS 
use may cause muscle hypertrophy without compensatory adaptations 
in tendons, ligaments, and joints, thus increasing the risk of tendon and 
joint injuries. AAS use is associated with acne, baldness, and increased 
body hair.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Detection of AAS Use

AAS  users  generally  mistrust  physicians  and  seek  medical  help 
infrequently;  when  they  do  seek  medical  help,  it  is  often  for  the 
treatment of AAS withdrawal syndrome, infertility, gynecomastia, 
or  other  medical  or  psychiatric  complications  of  AAS  use.  The 
suspicion of AAS use should be raised by the increased hemoglobin 
and hematocrit levels; suppressed LH, FSH, and testosterone levels; 
low HDL cholesterol; and low testicular volume and sperm density 
in  a  person  who  looks  highly  muscular  (Table  399-4).  A  combi-
nation of these findings along with self-report of their use by the 
patient—which  usually  can  be  elicited  by  a  tactful  interview—are 
often sufficient to establish a diagnosis in clinical practice.

Accredited laboratories use gas chromatography and mass spec-
trometry or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to detect 
AAS abuse. In recent years, the availability of high-resolution mass 
spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry has further improved 
the  sensitivity  of  detecting  AAS  abuse.  Illicit  testosterone  use  is 
detected generally by the application of the measurement of the uri-
nary testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio and further confirmed by 
the use of the 13C:12C ratio in testosterone by the use of isotope ratio 
combustion  mass  spectrometry.  Exogenous  testosterone  adminis-
tration  increases  urinary  testosterone  glucuronide  excretion  and 
consequently  the  testosterone-to-epitestosterone  ratio.  Ratios  >4 
suggest  exogenous  testosterone  use  but  can  also  reflect  genetic 
variation. Genetic variations in the uridine diphospho-glucuronyl

Note: In clinical settings, the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids can often be 
ascertained simply by direct questioning. Reduced testicular volume, suppressed 
LH and FSH, and increased hematocrit in an unusually muscular man should raise 
suspicion of anabolic-androgenic steroid use. Although rarely needed in clinical 
practice, recent use of anabolic-androgenic steroids can be confirmed by LC-MS/
MS analysis of urine. Exogenous testosterone use can be detected using the 
urinary testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio and isotope ratio mass spectrometry 
analysis to detect differences in 13C:12C ratio in exogenous and endogenous 
testosterone.

Synthetic testosterone has a lower  13C:12C ratio than endogenously 
produced testosterone, and these differences in the 13C:12C ratio can 
be  detected  by  isotope  ratio  combustion  mass  spectrometry  and 
used  to  confirm  exogenous  testosterone  use  in  individuals  with  a 
high testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio.

TREATMENT
Integrated Management of Patients with AAS Use

The nonathlete weightlifters who abuse AAS frequently do not seek 
medical treatment and often mistrust physicians. They also do not 
view these drugs and the associated lifestyle as deleterious to their 
health.  In  turn,  many  internists  erroneously  view  AAS  abuse  as 
largely a problem of cheating in competitive sports, while, in fact, 
most AAS users are not athletes at all. Also, physicians often have 
a  poor  understanding  of  the  factors  motivating  the  use  of  these 
performance-enhancing drugs, the long-term health effects of AAS, 
and  the  associated  psychopathologies  that  may  affect  treatment 
choices.

In  addition  to  treating  the  underlying  body  dysmorphia  disor-
der that motivates the use of these drugs, the treatment should be 
directed  at  the  symptoms  or  the  condition  for  which  the  patient 
seeks therapy, such as infertility, sexual dysfunction, gynecomastia, 
or  depressive  symptoms.  Accordingly,  therapy  may  include  some 
combination  of  cognitive  and  behavioral  therapy  for  muscle  dys-
morphia syndrome, antidepressant therapy for depression, selective 
PDE5  inhibitors  for  erectile  dysfunction,  and/or  use  of  selective 
estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors to reactivate 
HPT axis or hCG to restore testosterone levels.

As  discussed  above,  AASs  suppress  the  male  hypothalamic- 
pituitary-gonadal axis, and men with long-term AAS use may expe-
rience symptoms of profound androgen deficiency such as sexual 
dysfunction,  fatigue,  and  depressive  symptoms  during  AAS  with-
drawal. Some of these patients may resume AAS use or start using 
other drugs to combat the distressing withdrawal symptoms. There 
are no randomized trials of any therapies for AAS withdrawal. Case 
reports and clinical experience suggest that administration of selec-
tive  estrogen  receptor  modulators,  CYP19  aromatase  inhibitors, 
or  hCG  may  restore  circulating  testosterone  levels.  Clomiphene 
citrate, a partial estrogen receptor agonist, administered in a dose

of  25–50  mg  on  alternate  days,  can  increase  LH  and  FSH  levels 
and restore testosterone levels in a vast majority of men with AAS 
withdrawal  syndrome.  However,  the  recovery  of  sexual  function 
during clomiphene administration is variable despite improvements 
in testosterone levels. Anecdotally, other aromatase inhibitors such 
as  anastrozole  have  also  been  used.  hCG,  administered  by  intra-
muscular  injections  of  750–1500  IU  three  times  each  week,  can 
raise testosterone levels into the normal range. Some patients may 
not respond to either clomiphene or hCG therapy, raising the pos-
sibility of irreversible long-term toxic effects of AAS on Leydig cell 
function.

Adjunctive cognitive and behavioral therapy or antidepressants 
to treat depression inadequately responsive to endocrine therapies 
alone may be needed. Emerging human and animal evidence sug-
gests  AAS  and  opioids  likely  promote  dependence  via  common 
mechanisms. The opioid antagonist naltrexone blocks AAS depen-
dence in animals. Therefore, treatments for human opioid depen-
dence  might  also  benefit  AAS  dependence.  Many  patients  who 
abuse AAS suffer from body-image disorder and require psychiatric 
treatment for this underlying disorder.

 ■ LUTS IN MEN
LUTS  in  men  include  storage  symptoms  (urgency,  daytime  as  well 
as  nighttime  frequency,  and  urgency  incontinence),  voiding  distur-
bances (slow or intermittent stream, difficulty in initiating micturition, 
straining to void, pain or discomfort during the passage of urine, and 
terminal dribbling), or postmicturition symptoms (a sense of incom-
plete  voiding  after  passing  urine  and  postmicturition  dribble).  The 
overactive bladder syndrome refers to urgency with or without urgency 
incontinence, usually with urinary frequency and nocturia, and is often 
due to detrusor muscle overactivity. A presumptive diagnosis of benign 
prostatic  hyperplasia  should  be  made  only  in  men  with  LUTS,  who 
have demonstrable evidence of prostate enlargement and obstruction 
based on the size of the prostate. LUTS have historically been attributed 
to benign prostatic hyperplasia, although it has become apparent that 
the pathophysiologic mechanisms of LUTS are complex and multifac-
torial  and  may  include  structural  or  functional  abnormalities  of  the 
bladder, bladder neck, prostate, distal sphincter mechanism, and ure-
thra, as well as abnormalities in the neural control of the lower urinary 
tract. Diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, and other medications 
that have anticholinergic properties can cause or exacerbate LUTS in 
older men. The intensity of LUTS tends to fluctuate over time.

LUTS is highly prevalent in older men, affecting nearly 50% of men 
>65 and 70% of men >80 years old. The LUTS adversely affects quality 
of  life  because  of  its  impact  on  sleep,  ability  to  perform  activities  of 
daily living, and depressive symptoms. LUTS is often associated with 
erectile dysfunction.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms

Medical  evaluation  should  include  assessment  of  potential  causes 
of  symptoms;  medications  including  herbal  and  over-the-counter 
products that might contribute to symptoms; the symptom severity 
and  bother  using  an  International  Prostate  Symptom  Score;  and 
in some patients, a frequency-volume chart. The impact of LUTS 
on  sleep,  activities  of  daily  living,  and  quality  of  life  should  be 
evaluated.  Evaluation  should  also  include  digital  prostate  exami-
nation,  neurologic  examination  focused  on  perineum  and  lower 
extremities,  urinalysis,  fasting  blood  glucose,  electrolytes,  creatin-
ine,  and  prostate-specific  antigen  (PSA).  Urodynamic  studies  are 
not required in most patients but are recommended when invasive 
surgical therapies are being considered. A urologic referral may be 
appropriate  if  the  patient  has  hydronephrosis,  renal  insufficiency, 
recurrent  urinary  tract  infections,  hematuria,  or  history  of  acute 
urinary retention.

TREATMENT
Patients with LUTS

Considerations of the severity of symptoms; the impact of symptoms 
on sleep, activities of daily living, and quality of life; the natural his-
tory of the disease; and potential adverse effects of the intervention 
should guide the decision to intervene. In men with mild to mod-
erately  severe  LUTS,  the  symptoms  typically  progress  slowly  over 
many years and may remain stable or even improve in some men. 
The  men  who  have  mild  symptoms  can  usually  be  reassured  and 
followed. Several simple steps such as reducing caffeine and alcohol 
intake, especially late in the day, taking the diuretic medication early 
in the day, avoiding excessive water intake close to bedtime, bladder 
training, pelvic floor exercises including biofeedback to promote pel-
vic floor relaxation, and timed voiding regimens or double voiding to 
ensure complete emptying of the bladder may be helpful in reducing 
the severity of symptoms. Men with mild to moderate bothersome 
LUTS  can  be  treated  effectively  using  α-adrenergic  antagonists, 
steroid 5α-reductase inhibitors, PDE5 inhibitors, or anticholinergic 
agents  alone  or  in  combination.  Selective  α-adrenergic  antagonists 
are  typically  the  first  line  of  therapy;  their  side  effects  include 
hypotension, dizziness, nasal congestion, retrograde or delayed ejac-
ulation,  and  rarely  floppy  iris  syndrome.  In  men  with  probable 
benign prostate obstruction with gland enlargement and LUTS, ther-
apy with steroid 5α-reductase inhibitors, finasteride, or dutasteride 
for 1 or more years improves urinary symptoms and flow rate and 
reduces  prostatic  volume.  Long-term  treatment  with  5α-reductase 
inhibitors can reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and need for 
prostate surgery. Combined administration of a steroid 5α-reductase 
inhibitor and an α1-adrenergic blocker can rapidly improve urinary 
symptoms and reduce the relative risk of acute urinary retention and 
surgery. PDE5 inhibitors, when administered chronically alone or in 
combination with α-adrenergic blockers, are effective in improving 
LUTS and erectile dysfunction through their effects on nitric oxide–
cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate  (cGMP)  in  the  bladder,  urethra, 
and prostate. PDE5 inhibitors do not improve uroflow parameters, 
and  their  hypotensive  effect  may  be  potentiated  by  α1-adrenergic 
blockers. Anticholinergic drugs are used for the treatment of over-
active bladder in men with prominent irritative symptoms, such as 
frequency,  urgency,  and  incontinence,  and  no  evidence  of  elevated 
postvoid  residual  urine.  Containment  products,  such  as  pads,  can 
help improve social life in men who have severe storage symptoms, 
including incontinence. Surgery is indicated when medical therapy 
fails, symptoms progress in spite of medical therapy, or the patient 
develops  acute  urinary  retention,  hydronephrosis,  renal  insuffi-
ciency,  or  recurrent  urinary  tract  infections,  or  if  the  patient  has 
postvoid residual urine volume >25% of the urinary bladder volume.

 ■ MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS OF  
PROSTATE CANCER THERAPY
Prostate  cancer  is  the  most  common  malignancy  in  American  men, 
accounting  for  19%  of  all  diagnosed  cancers  and  ~8%  of  all  cancer 
deaths;  its  incidence  is  on  the  rise,  partly  due  to  increased  screen-
ing  with  PSA.  The  American  Cancer  Society  estimates  that,  in 
2021,  248,530  new  cases  of  prostate  cancer  will  be  diagnosed  in  the  
United States and 34,130 men will die from this disease. The majority 
of  these  men  have  low-grade,  organ-confined  prostate  cancer  and 
excellent  prospects  of  long-term  survival.  Substantial  improvement 
in survival in men with prostate cancer has focused attention on the 
high prevalence of sexual dysfunction, physical dysfunction, and low 
vitality in the men, which are important contributors to poor quality 
of life among patients treated for prostate cancer. The pathophysiology 
of  these  symptoms  after  radical  prostatectomy  is  multifactorial,  but 
denervation  and  androgen  deficiency  are  important  contributors  to 
these symptoms.

Androgen deficiency is common in men with prostate cancer. Tes-
tosterone  levels  decline  with  age,  and  men  with  prostate  cancer  are 
at risk of having low testosterone levels simply by virtue of their age. 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   3075

3076 However, total and free testosterone levels are even lower in men with 
prostate cancer who have undergone prostatectomy, when compared to 
noncancer age-matched controls. This age-related androgen deficiency 
in  men  with  prostate  cancer  is  associated  with  fatigue,  sexual  dys-
function,  mobility  limitation,  and  decreased  physical  function.  Even 
with  bilateral  nerve-sparing  procedure,  >50%  of  men  develop  sexual 
dysfunction  after  surgery.  Although  there  is  some  recovery  of  sexual 
function  with  passage  of  time,  40–50%  of  men  undergoing  radical 
prostatectomy find their sexual performance to be a moderate to large 
problem 18 months after surgery. Sexual problems are a source of psy-
chosocial distress in men with localized prostate cancer. The men with 
locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer who undergo androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) encounter even more distressing symptoms 
because  of  the  profound  androgen  deficiency.  In  addition  to  fatigue, 
sexual  dysfunction,  and  hot  flushes,  these  men  are  at  increased  risk 
for diabetes, metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and frailty.
Testosterone  Therapy  in  Men  with  a  History  of  Prostate  
Cancer  A history of prostate cancer has historically been considered 
a  contraindication  for  testosterone  therapy.  This  guidance  is  based 
on  observations  that  testosterone  promotes  the  growth  of  metastatic 
prostate  cancer.  Metastatic  prostate  cancer  generally  regresses  after 
orchidectomy  and  ADT.  Androgen  receptor  signaling  plays  a  central 
role in maintaining growth of normal prostate and prostate cancer. PSA 
levels  are  lower  in  hypogonadal  men  and  increase  after  testosterone 
therapy. Prostate volume is lower in hypogonadal men and increases 
after testosterone therapy to levels seen in age-matched controls.

However,  the  role  of  testosterone  in  prostate  cancer  is  complex. 
Epidemiologic  studies  and  their  meta-analyses  have  not  revealed  a 
consistent relationship between serum testosterone and prostate can-
cer.  Others  have  reported  that  low  testosterone  levels  are  associated 
with high-grade cancers. In a landmark randomized trial, testosterone 
therapy of older men with low testosterone did not affect intraprostatic 
androgen  levels  or  the  expression  of  androgen-dependent  prostatic 
genes.  The  suppression  of  circulating  testosterone  levels  by  a  GnRH 
antagonist also does not affect intraprostatic androgen concentrations. 
Open-label trials and retrospective analyses of testosterone therapy in 
men with prostate cancer, who have undergone radical prostatectomy 
and  have  undetectable  PSA  levels  after  radical  prostatectomy,  have 
found very low rates of PSA recurrence. Even in men with high-grade 
prostatic  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (HGPIN)—a  group  at  high  risk  of 
developing  prostate  cancer—testosterone  therapy  for  1  year  did  not 
increase PSA or rates of prostate cancer.

A  majority  of  men  diagnosed  with  prostate  cancer  today  have 
localized  disease  that  can  be  potentially  cured  by  radical  prostatec-
tomy.  The  men  with  organ-confined  prostate  cancer  (pT2,  N0,  M0) 
and Gleason score <6 are at a very low risk of disease recurrence after 
radical prostatectomy with 0.5% biochemical recurrence rate and 0.2% 
local  recurrence  rate  at  >10–15  years.  Similarly,  preoperative  PSA  
<10 ng/mL is associated with lower risk of disease recurrence than PSA  
>10  ng/mL.  After  radical  prostatectomy,  in  the  absence  of  residual 
cancer,  PSA  becomes  undetectable  within  a  month.  An  undetectable 
PSA  after  radical  prostatectomy  is  a  good  indicator  of  biochemical 
recurrence-free  survival  at  5  years.  Therefore,  men  with  organ-con-
fined prostate cancer (pT2), Gleason score <6, and a preoperative PSA 
of  <10  ng/mL,  who  have  had  undetectable  PSA  levels  (<0.1  ng/mL) 
for >2 years after radical prostatectomy, have very low risk of disease 
recurrence (<0.5% at 10 years) and may be considered for testosterone 
therapy on an individualized basis. If testosterone therapy is instituted, 
it should be associated with careful monitoring of PSA levels and close 
consultation with a urologist.
 ■ MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS OF ADT
In patients with prostate cancer and distant metastases, ADT improves 
survival. In patients with locally advanced disease, ADT in combina-
tion  with  external  beam  radiation  or  as  an  adjuvant  therapy  (post-
prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy) also has been shown to 
improve survival. However, ADT is being increasingly used as primary 
therapy in men with localized disease and in men encountering bio-
chemical recurrence without clear evidence of survival advantage. The 

overall use of ADT in men with prostate cancer has increased in the 
past two decades, and its use in men with localized disease and bio-
chemical recurrence accounts for a substantial fraction of this increase. 
Since most men with prostate cancer die of conditions other than their 
primary  malignancy,  recognition  and  management  of  these  adverse 
effects is paramount.

Profound  hypogonadism  resulting  from  ADT  is  associated  with 
sexual  dysfunction,  vasomotor  symptoms,  gynecomastia,  decreased 
muscle mass and strength, frailty, increased fat mass, anemia, fatigue, 
bone loss, loss of body hair, depressive symptoms, and reduced quality 
of life. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease have recently been added 
to the list of these complications (Fig. 399-4). Treatment with GnRH 
agonists in men with prostate cancer is associated with rapid induction 
of  insulin  resistance,  hyperinsulinemia,  and  a  significant  increase  in 
the risk of incident diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is prevalent in >50% 
of  men  undergoing  long-term  ADT  when  compared  to  age-matched 
men with prostate cancer not undergoing ADT (22%) and their age-
matched eugonadal counterparts (20%). Some but not all studies have 
reported an increased risk of cardiovascular events, death due to car-
diovascular events, and peripheral vascular disease in men undergoing 
ADT. Some reports suggest that men receiving ADT are at an increased 
risk of thromboembolic events and cognitive dysfunction. The rates of 
acute kidney injury are higher in men currently receiving ADT than in 
men not receiving ADT; the increased risk appears to be particularly 
associated with the use of combined regimens of a GnRH agonist plus 
an  antiandrogen.  ADT  also  is  associated  with  substantially  increased 
risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Men Receiving ADT

The  benefits  of  ADT  in  treating  nonmetastatic  prostate  cancer 
should  be  carefully  weighed  against  the  risks  of  ADT-induced 
adverse events (Table 399-5). If ADT is medically indicated, con-
sider  whether  intermittent  ADT  is  a  feasible  option.  Men  being 
considered  for  ADT  should  undergo  assessment  of  cardiovas-
cular,  diabetes,  and  fracture  risk;  this  assessment  may  include 
measurement  of  blood  glucose,  plasma  lipids,  and  bone  mineral 
density  by  dual  energy  x-ray  absorptiometry.  Institute  measures 
to prevent bone loss, including physical activity, adequate calcium 
and  vitamin  D  intake,  and  pharmacologic  therapy  in  men  with  a 
previous  minimal  trauma  fracture  and  those  with  10-year  risk  of 
a  major  osteoporotic  fracture  >20%,  unless  contraindicated.  Bis-
phosphonates and denosumab have been shown to reduce fracture 
risk in men undergoing ADT, and zoledronic acid and denosumab 
have  been  approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration 
for  the  prevention  of  metastasis-related  skeletal-related  events  in 
this population. Men with prostate cancer who are receiving ADT 
should be monitored for weight gain and diabetes. Encourage life-
style  interventions,  including  physical  activity  and  exercise,  and 
attention to weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, blood glucose, and 
smoking  cessation  to  reduce  the  risk  of  cardiometabolic  compli-
cations.  In  randomized  trials,  medroxyprogesterone,  cyproterone 
acetate,  and  the  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor  venlafaxine  have 
been shown to be more efficacious than placebo in alleviating hot 
flushes.  The  side  effects  of  these  medications—increased  appetite 
and  weight  gain  with  medroxyprogesterone,  gynecomastia  with 
estrogenic compounds, and dry mouth with venlafaxine—should be 
weighed against their relative efficacy. Acupuncture, soy products, 
vitamin E, herbal medicines, and transdermal estradiol have been 
used empirically for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms without 
clear  evidence  of  efficacy.  Gynecomastia  can  be  prevented  by  the 
use  of  an  antiestrogen,  an  aromatase  inhibitor,  or  local  radiation 
therapy; these therapies are effective in alleviating pain and tender-
ness but are less effective in reducing established gynecomastia. For 
long-standing  gynecomastia  that  persists  after  cessation  of  ADT 
and is bothersome, mammoplasty is an effective treatment option.

 ■ PREVENTION OF SEXUALLY  
TRANSMITTED DISEASES
Adolescent boys and young men aged 15–24 years; men who have sex 
with  men,  have  multiple  sex  partners,  have  unprotected  sex  without 
condom, or have sex with sex workers; men who use illicit drugs; men 
who have a history of previous sexually transmitted infection (STI); and 
transgender men are at increased risk for STIs. STIs increase the risk of 
oropharyngeal and anogenital cancers, liver disease, pelvic pain, infer-
tility, inadvertent transmission of infection to others, and emergency 
department visits and are a preventable cause of excess morbidity and 
mortality. HIV, hepatitis B and C infections, and syphilis can have addi-
tional disease-specific complications. The prevention and treatment of 
STIs are discussed in Chap. 136. Additionally, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF) have published guidelines on the prevention, treatment, and 

TABLE 399-5  Checklist for Men Undergoing Androgen Deprivation 
Therapy (ADT)
1.  Weigh the risks and benefits of ADT and whether intermittent ADT is a 

feasible and safe option.

2.  Perform a baseline assessment including fasting glucose, plasma lipids, 

blood pressure, bone mineral density, and FRAX score.

3.  Optimize calcium and vitamin D intake, encourage structured physical activity 
and exercise, and consider pharmacologic therapy in men with a previous 
minimal trauma fracture and those with a 10-year risk of a major osteoporotic 
fracture >20%, unless contraindicated.

4.  Monitor body weight, fasting glucose, plasma lipids, blood pressure, and 
bone mineral density, and encourage smoking cessation and physical 
activity.

5.  In men who are receiving ADT and who experience bothersome hot flushes, 
as indicated by sleep disturbance or interference with work or activities 
of daily living, consider initial therapy with venlafaxine. If ineffective, add 
medroxyprogesterone acetate.

6.  In men who experience painful breast enlargement, consider therapy with an 

estrogen receptor antagonist, such as tamoxifen.

pre- and postexposure prophylaxis of STIs. The approach to the pre-
vention of STIs includes a structured risk assessment; counseling about 
safe sex practices including condom use; immunization of individuals 
at  risk;  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  infected  individuals  whether  or 
not they are symptomatic; detection and treatment of sexual partners; 
and targeted sex education of adolescents and young men who are at 
high  risk  for  STIs.  The  USPSTF  recommends  screening  for  HIV  in 
all men aged 15–65 years, regardless of risk, and for hepatitis B virus 
and syphilis in men at increased risk. Because more than half of STIs 
occur  in  persons  aged  15–24  years,  the  USPSTF  also  recommends 
behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and adult men 
at increased risk of STIs to encourage condom use and other protective 
behaviors, including consideration of abstinence, reducing the number 
of sex partners, and avoidance of unsafe sex practices. Consistent and 
correct condom use is the most important method of preventing STIs. 
Effective immunizations are available against hepatitis B, human papil-
lomavirus  (HPV),  and  Neisseria  meningitides.  The  CDC’s  Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends universal 
hepatitis B immunization for all unvaccinated adults presenting to an 
STI clinic, all HIV-infected adults, and health workers. Although ACIP 
recommends HPV vaccination in males aged 9–21 years and in men 
aged 9–26 if they have sex with men or have an immunocompromising 
condition, recent data suggest that the prevalence of HPV and its com-
plications continue to increase until middle age, and some experts rec-
ommend extending the age limit for HPV vaccination. Meningococcal 
vaccination is indicated for men who have sex with men from an area 
of outbreak and for all HIV-infected men.

Because  men  seeking  care  in  men’s  health  clinics  often  do  so  for 
sexual  and  urogenital  problems,  these  visits  offer  opportunities  for 
counseling, screening, and treatment of STIs and institution of immu-
nization and other preventive measures for STIs.

3078 virus are more likely to have a more severe disease, require mechanical 
ventilation,  have  disease  complications,  and  die  of  the  disease  than 
women. Somewhat similar sex differences in morbidity and mortality 
have  been  reported  for  influenza  infection.  In  the  United  States,  the 
incidence and rates of hospitalization for influenza are higher in men 
than in women across all age groups. However, the sex-specific mor-
tality rates associated with influenza vary substantially across countries 
and age groups. The sex differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 
infection  and  morbidity  have  been  attributed  to  behavioral  factors, 
such  as  higher  rates  of  smoking  and  alcohol  use  in  men;  biologic 
factors,  such  as  higher  rates  of  comorbid  conditions  in  men  than  in 
women;  sex  differences  in  immune  responses,  including  a  poor  T 
lymphocyte response to SARS-CoV-2 infection; and lower expression 
levels in men of X-linked genes that are involved in the innate detection 
of  RNA  viruses  and  that  escape  X  inactivation  in  women,  resulting 
in higher expression levels in women. Additionally, the expression of 
angiotensin-converting  enzyme  2  (ACE2)  and  the  cell  surface  trans-
membrane  protease  serine  2  (TMPRSS2),  the  two  host  proteins  that 
facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the alveolar cells, is regulated 
by androgens in subsets of lung epithelial cells, and it is possible that 
higher testosterone levels in men may contribute to increased suscep-
tibility to the infection.

and Transgender  
(LGBT) Health
Baligh R. Yehia, Zachary B. R. McClain

 ■ UNDERSTANDING LGBT HEALTH DISPARITIES
The acceptance of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) 
community has greatly increased over the past decade in certain com-
munities and parts of the world. However, numerous studies highlight 
health  disparities  involving  the  care  of  LGBT  people.  Lesbian  and 
bisexual  women  are  less  likely  to  receive  recommended  preventive 
screenings  such  as  breast,  cervical,  and  colorectal  cancer  screenings. 
Among men who have sex with men, rates of human papillomavirus–
associated anal cancers are 17 times higher than those of heterosexual 
men. In addition, gay and bisexual men accounted for 70% of all new 
HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2018, and they disproportion-
ately contract sexually transmitted infections. In 2018, men who have 
sex  with  men  accounted  for  64%  of  primary  and  secondary  syphilis 
infections  in  the  United  States  where  the  sex  of  the  sexual  partner 
was known. Transgender individuals have a higher prevalence of HIV 
infection and suicide compared with other groups.

Research has found that LGBT individuals are more likely to expe-
rience depression, anxiety, and alcohol and drug use than their coun-
terparts. Most concerning are the rates of suicide attempts and ideation 
among  the  LGBT  community,  particularly  youth.  Lesbian,  gay,  and 
bisexual (LGB) youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than 
their  heterosexual  peers,  and  61%  of  gender  variant  youth  reported 
suicidal ideation at some point in their life. Additionally, the recent U.S. 
Transgender Survey found that 40% of transgender young adults and 
adults reported attempting suicide at some point in their lives.

In addition, U.S. studies indicate that substance abuse is twice as com-
mon in LGBT youth compared with their counterparts. These findings 
are  mirrored  among  LGBT  adults:  the  prevalence  of  substance  abuse 
disorders is 20–30% compared with ~9% in the general population.

These health issues are compounded by structural barriers to health 
care,  including  decreased  access  to  medical  care,  lack  of  awareness 
to  the  unique  health  needs  of  LGBT  individuals,  and  stigma  and 
discrimination  toward  the  LGBT  community.  Many  LGB  individuals 
perceive  the  health  care  setting  and  providers  as  threatening,  which 
may  lead  to  avoiding  needed  medical  care  or  withholding  important 
medical  information.  A  large  U.S.  survey  identified  that  8%  of  LGB 
and 27% of transgender individuals were refused needed health care, 
and almost 11% of LGB and 21% of transgender people reported being 
subjected  to  harsh  or  abusive  language  by  health  care  professionals. 
Apart from health care settings, more than two-thirds of LGB people 
report discrimination in their personal lives, and 90% of transgender 
individuals  report  harassment,  mistreatment,  or  discrimination  at 
work. Chronic exposure to high levels of stress from real or anticipated 
discrimination, referred to as “minority stress,” may be an important 
factor contributing to the poor health outcomes experienced by LGBT 
populations.

While  some  research  on  LGBT  health  has  been  conducted,  there 
remains  a  great  opportunity  to  better  understand  the  needs  and 
experiences  of  LGBT  individuals.  Moreover,  many  LGBT  individuals 
experience health disparities across their life cycle (e.g., LGBT youth

are at greater risk of suicide and homelessness, whereas elderly LGBT 
individuals face barriers to health because of isolation and fewer family 
supports),  necessitating  a  longitudinal  approach  to  examining  LGBT 
health  issues.  There  are  more  limited  data  on  the  health  of  LGBT 
individuals  outside  the  United  States  and  Europe.  However,  studies 
demonstrate that problems are greatest when people cannot be open 
about their sexual orientation and gender identity. Encouraging greater 
LGBT acceptance and access to health care will be critical to improving 
outcomes and experiences for LGBT communities.

 ■ CREATING POSITIVE HEALTH EXPERIENCES  
FOR LGBT PATIENTS
Understanding  Gender  Identity  and  Sexual  Orientation  
Addressing health disparities and creating positive health care experi-
ences require an understanding of the diversity of cultural expression 
and lives of LGBT persons. First, providers must be able to distinguish 
gender  identity  from  sexual  orientation.  Gender  identity  is  a  person’s 
internal  sense  of  their  gender.  It  should  not  be  confused  with  sex 
assigned  at  birth,  which  is  based  on  anatomy  and  biology.  Gender 

identity  expands  beyond  the  binary  male  and  female  and  includes 
persons who think of their gender as containing elements of both or 
neither. Many individuals who do not identify with the gender that cor-
relates with their sex assigned at birth often use the terms transgender 
or trans-male or trans-female to identify themselves. Sexual orientation 
refers  to  how  one  thinks  of  their  physical  or  emotional  attraction  to 
others. Sexual orientation has three dimensions: attraction, behavior, 
and  identity.  Attraction  refers  to  one’s  desire  to  be  with  someone, 
regardless of one’s behavior or stated identity. For example, a woman 
may be attracted to another woman, but this attraction may never be 
acted  upon  and  may  not  form  part  of  her  sexual  identity.  Behavior 
refers  to  a  person’s  sexual  and  romantic  partners.  Although  sexual 
identity often aligns with behavior, some individuals who identify as 
heterosexual  may  have  same-gender  partners  and  some  individuals 
who  identify  as  lesbian  or  gay  may  have  different-gender  partners. 
Lastly, identity refers to how a person defines their own sexuality. Com-
mon  terms  for  sexual  identity  include  gay,  lesbian,  bisexual,  straight, 
heterosexual, homosexual, and asexual (Table 400-1). As individuals go 
through the process of understanding their sexuality and self-identity 
over time, they may change how they define their sexual identity.

DEFINITION
Identifying as having no gender.
Experiencing little or no sexual attraction to others.
The sex (male or female) assigned to a child at birth, most often based on the child’s external anatomy. Also referred to as birth sex, 
natal sex, biological sex, or sex.
A sexual orientation that describes a person who is emotionally and sexually attracted to people of their own gender and people of 
other genders.
A person whose gender identity and assigned sex at birth correspond (i.e., a person who is not transgender).
A sexual orientation that describes a person who is emotionally and sexually attracted to people of their own gender. It can be used 
regardless of gender identity, but it is more commonly used to describe men.
Distress experienced by some individuals whose gender identity does not correspond with their assigned sex at birth. Manifests as 
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
The way a person acts, dresses, speaks, and behaves (i.e., feminine, masculine, androgynous). Gender expression does not 
necessarily correspond to assigned sex at birth or gender identity.
A person’s internal sense of being a man/male, woman/female, both, neither, or another gender.
Expressing a gender that differs from a given society’s norms for males and females.
A sexual orientation that describes women who are emotionally and sexually attracted to men, and men who are emotionally and 
sexually attracted to women.
A group of rare conditions where the reproductive organs and genitals do not develop as expected.

A sexual orientation that describes a woman who is emotionally and sexually attracted to other women.
Categories used in research and public health to describe those who engage in same-sex sexual behavior, regardless of their 
sexual orientation. Individuals rarely use the terms MSM or WSW to describe themselves.

Describes a person whose gender identity comprises many genders.
A sexual orientation that describes a person who is emotionally and sexually attracted to people regardless of gender.
An umbrella term used by some to describe people who think of their sexual orientation or gender identity as outside of societal 
norms. Some people view the term as more fluid and inclusive than traditional categories for sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Due to its history as a derogatory term, it is not embraced or used by all members of the LGBT community.
Describes an individual who is unsure about or is exploring their own sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
Describes the experience of a person who is emotionally and/or sexually attracted to people of the same gender. Use of this term is 
not indicative of a person’s sexual behavior.
Describes how a person characterizes their physical and emotional attraction to others. Sexual orientation is distinct from sex, 
gender identity, and gender expression.
A transgender person whose gender identity is male may use these terms to describe themselves. Some will just use the term man.

A transgender person whose gender identity is female may use these terms to describe themselves. Some will just use the term 
woman.
Describes a person whose gender identity and assigned sex at birth do not correspond. Also used as an umbrella term to include 
gender identities outside of male and female.
For transgender persons, the process of coming to recognize, accept, and express one’s gender identity. Most often, this refers to 
the period when a person makes social, legal, and/or medical changes, such as changing their clothing, name, and sex designation, 
as well as using medical interventions.

The creation of a welcoming environment requires not making any 
assumptions  about  an  individual’s  gender  identity  or  sexual  orienta-
tion. Both front-line staff and clinicians should be cognizant of patient 
communication. For example:

•	 Instead of saying “How may I help you, sir?”, say “How may I help 

you?”

•	 Instead of saying “She is here for her appointment,” say “The patient 

is here in the waiting room.”

•	 Instead of saying “Do you have a wife?”, say “Are you in a relationship?
•	 Instead of saying “What are your mother’s and father’s names?”, say 

“What are your parents’ names?”

Developing  Comfort  and  Competency  in  Sexual  Health  
Developing comfort discussing sexual health and intimacy is critical to 
providing appropriate care. After inquiring about healthy relationships 
and  relationship  status,  a  good  starting  place  is  to  ask  if  a  patient  is 
sexually  active  and,  if  so,  with  whom,  how  often,  and  what  types  of 
physical interactions and types of sex they have with their partner(s). 
These  discussions  can  allow  clinicians  to  focus  subsequent  conver-
sations  on  issues  most  relevant  to  a  patient’s  health.  For  example,  a 
gay man with multiple sexual partners who engages in receptive anal 
sex without condoms is at high risk for HIV and sexually transmitted 
infections  (STIs).  It  will  be  important  to  recommend  more  frequent 
screenings for STIs and discuss use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
and condoms to prevent HIV and STIs. Additionally, if you are seeing 
a  transgender  man,  it  will  be  important  to  know  if  he  still  has  natal 
female  genitalia  to  ensure  appropriate  cancer  screening,  desire  for 
having biologic children, and contraceptive needs. Notably, many if not 
most transgender people have not had gender affirmation surgery and 
retain their natal sex organs.

Creating  a  Welcoming  and  Safe  Health  Care  Environment  
Hospitals and clinics can take a number of steps to create a welcom-
ing and safe space for LGBT patients. This starts by establishing and 
communicating  a  nondiscrimination  policy  that  clearly  includes 
gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation protections. 
Additionally,  hospitals  and  clinics  can  develop  and  implement  an 
equal  visitation  policy  to  ensure  equal  visitation  for  LGBT  patients 
from  same-sex  partners,  parents,  and  other  family  and  friends.  
Staff training in LGBT patient-centered care also is a key component of 
creating inclusive health environments. This includes covering LGBT 
cultural  competency,  caring  for  LGBT  patients,  creating  an  inclusive 
environment for LGBT patients and staff, and other topics important 
for LGBT health.

As hospitals and clinics continue to adopt electronic health records, 
collecting sexual orientation and gender identity information becomes 
increasingly important to delivering personalized care to LGBT indi-
viduals. It allows providers to monitor quality of care and track pop-
ulation-based  outcomes.  This  information  can  be  captured  by  three 
questions:

•	 How do you think of yourself? As straight or heterosexual; lesbian, 
gay,  or  homosexual;  bisexual;  something  else;  don’t  know;  choose 
not to disclose.

•	 What  is  your  current  gender  identity?  Male;  female;  transgender 
male/trans  man/female-to-male  (FTM);  transgender  female/trans 
woman/male-to-female  (MTF);  genderqueer,  neither  exclusively 
male nor female; additional category, please specify; choose not to 
disclose.

•	 What sex were you assigned at birth on your original birth certificate? 

Male; female; choose not to disclose.

The  physical  environment  of  a  hospital  or  clinic  is  important,  but 
the majority of clinical spaces do not signal that they are safe spaces 
for LGBT patients. Most health care posters, pamphlets, and materials 
feature  heterosexual  individuals  or  couples;  adding  LGBT-friendly 
images and text can help signal that the hospital or clinic is a safe 
space  for  sexual  and  gender  minorities.  In  addition,  easily  identify-
ing  LGBT-competent  providers  by  using  websites,  buttons,  and  pins 
can  help  patients  select  providers  and  feel  at  ease  when  attending 

appointments.  Lastly,  designating  all-gender  bathrooms  is  important 
to  creating  welcoming  spaces,  particularly  for  transgender  and  gen-
der-nonconforming individuals.
 ■ FUTURE DIRECTION IN LGBT HEALTH
While  social  and  cultural  acceptance  of  the  LGBT  community  has 
improved in certain parts of the world, many LGBT individuals con-
tinue to experience discrimination, stigmatization, and violence. Ineq-
uitable health care policies and practices, lack of awareness of LGBT 
health issues, and limited understanding of the unique health needs of 
LGBT individuals contribute to decreased access to care and disparities 
in  health  outcomes  for  LGBT  individuals.  Addressing  these  barriers 
will require improved data collection on the LGBT population; under-
standing of the intersectionality of gender identity, sexual orientation, 
race/ethnicity,  and  other  sociocultural  determinants  of  health;  and 
outcomes-focused research across the life course. In striving to deliver 
high-quality  care  experiences  for  all  patients,  hospitals,  clinics,  and 
providers need to focus on meeting the needs of the LGBT community.

Section 3  Obesity, Diabetes Mellitus, 
and Metabolic Syndrome

401 Pathobiology of Obesity

Stephen O’Rahilly, I. Sadaf Farooqi

Adipose tissue evolved as a solution to the challenge of the intermittent 
availability of food. At times when food is plentiful, excess calories are 
converted to triglycerides and efficiently stored in the unilocular lipid 
droplets  that  occupy  most  of  the  volume  of  fat  cells.  When  needed, 
the triglyceride is rapidly broken down to free fatty acids and glycerol, 
which  provide  an  energy  source  to  other  sites  throughout  the  body.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismHowever,  in  environments  where  food  is  abundant  and  when  indi-
viduals tend to be sedentary, the chronic excess of energy intake over 
expenditure leads to obesity. The risks of becoming obese under those 
circumstances and of developing the illnesses associated with obesity 
vary  greatly  between  individuals,  with  that  variation  having  a  strong 
genetic basis.
 ■ DEFINITION OF OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT
Obesity is defined as a state of excess adipose tissue mass that adversely 
affects  health.  The  direct  measurement  of  fat  mass  is  not  something 
that is readily undertaken in routine clinical practice, so a proxy mea-
sure, the body mass index (BMI), is generally used. This is calculated as 
weight/height2 (in kg/m2) (Fig. 401-1). BMI-based definitions of obe-
sity and overweight have been established based on associations with 
certain morbidities and excess mortality. These definitions have been 
based largely on studies of predominantly white, Western populations, 
and there is growing evidence that the relationship between BMI and 
adverse outcomes may be different in people from other ethnic groups, 
usually in the direction of worse health outcomes being seen at lower 
levels of BMI. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a BMI 
of 30 kg/m2 as the cutoff point for obesity, while individuals with values 
between 25 and 30 kg/m2 are classified as overweight. For individuals 
with  a  very  muscular  body  habitus,  the  BMI  may  overestimate  the 
amount of body fat. For any given BMI, women will generally have a 
higher percentage of body fat than men.

The  extent  to  which  different  adipose  depots  expand  in  response 
to chronic overnutrition varies markedly between people. In general, 
females store more fat in subcutaneous tissues, especially on buttocks, 
thighs,  and  upper  arms,  whereas  men  are  more  prone  to  store  fat  in 
intraabdominal and truncal subcutaneous sites. A simple measure of 
fat distribution is provided by a measurement of the waist-to-hip ratio. 
Independent of how obese a person is, a waist-to-hip ratio >0.9 in 
women  and  >1.0  in  men  is  associated  with  adverse  health  outcomes 
such as type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
The  annual  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey 
(NHANES) provides an ongoing record of the prevalence of obesity in 
the United States. In 2017–2018, 42.4% of U.S. adults aged ≥20 years old 
were obese with no significant differences in prevalence by age group. 
Non-Hispanic  black  people  had  the  highest  prevalence  of  obesity  at 
49.6%,  followed  by  Hispanic  (44.8%),  non-Hispanic  white  (42.2%), 
and non-Hispanic Asian (17.4%) people. In the United States, Asians 
represent a highly heterogeneous group encompassing both East and 
South  Asia  as  well  as  a  substantial  Filipino  community.  The  risks  of 
obesity and its complications may differ greatly between people from 
different parts of Asia; in general, the prevalence of obesity is some-
what  higher  in  women  than  in  men,  with  black  women  having  the

highest prevalence at 56.9%. There has been a marked increase in the 
prevalence of obesity over time. For example, between 1976 and 1980, 
the NHANES survey reported a prevalence of 14.5%, indicating a near 
threefold increase over the past 40 years.

This  trend  is  seen  globally.  According  to  the  WHO,  obesity  has 
nearly tripled worldwide since 1975. In 2016, >1.9 billion adults aged 
≥18 years old were overweight. Of these, >650 million were obese; 39% 
of adults aged ≥18 years old were overweight in 2016, and 13% were 
obese.  Most  of  the  world’s  population  lives  in  countries  where  over-
weight and obesity kills more people than underweight.

During this time, one of the most striking changes has been in the 
prevalence of obesity in children. In children, the relationship between 
BMI and body fat varies considerably with age and with pubertal mat-
uration; however, when adjusted for age and sex, BMI is a reasonable 
proxy for fat mass. Using age- and sex-specific BMI cutoffs (overweight 
≥91st  percentile;  obesity  ≥99th  percentile),  in  2019,  the  WHO  esti-
mated that 38 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or 
obese, and in 2016, they reported that 340 million children and adoles-
cents aged 5–19 were overweight or obese.

 ■ PHYSIOLOGIC REGULATION OF  
ENERGY BALANCE
Discussions about obesity so frequently focus on the issues of personal 
choice or the obesogenic environment that it can be easy to forget that 
the  amount  of  stored  energy  in  our  bodies  is  subject  to  homeostatic 
control by fundamental physiologic processes essential to our survival. 
In  the  1940s,  it  was  demonstrated  that  rodents  defend  their  level  of 
body  fat;  once  returned  to  ad  libitum  diets  after  a  short  period  of 
enforced caloric restriction or excess, animals either overconsumed or 
underconsumed  calories  until  they  returned  to  their  previous  status. 
Since  that  time,  research  has  progressively  dissected  the  signals  that 
sense nutrient stores and the contents of our diets and how this infor-
mation is integrated to control hunger, satiety, and the expenditure of 
energy. The key locus for the integration of these signals is the hypo-
thalamus, an area of the brain at least partially outside the blood-brain 
barrier that facilitates its ability to receive hormonal signals and com-
bine these with sensory, cognitive, and other neural inputs.

The  hypothalamus  receives  two  broad  types  of  hormonal  signals 
relevant to energy balance (Fig. 401-2). The circulating concentration 
of  leptin,  a  peptide  hormone  produced  by  fat  cells,  increases  as  fat 
stores  increase  and  declines  as  fat  stores  are  depleted.  Importantly, 
under  conditions  of  caloric  restriction,  circulating  leptin  levels  fall 
faster than the disappearance of fat. Humans born without functional 
leptin  or  leptin  receptors,  although  normal  weight  at  birth,  become 
severely obese from an early age, largely as a result of an intense insa-
tiable  appetite.  Clearly,  a  reduction  of  leptin  below  normal  level  is  a 
powerful  stimulus  to  food  intake  and  largely  explains  the  rebound 
overeating  and  weight  regain  that  occurs  after  a  period  of  starvation 
or dieting. The hypothalamus also receives hormonal signals that are 
more immediately related to the amount and type of food that has been 
ingested.  Peripheral  hormones  such  as  cholecystokinin  (CCK)  from 
the  stomach,  glucagon-like  peptide  1  (GLP-1)  and  gastric  inhibitory 
polypeptide  (GIP)  from  enteroendocrine  cells  of  the  small  intestine, 
and peptide YY (PYY) and oxyntomodulin from the large intestine are 
secreted in response to eating a meal and/or the presence of nutrients 
in the intestinal lumen. Their release together with neural signals from 
the vagus nerve and the enteric nervous system contributes to satiety, 
often indirectly acting on the hypothalamus via projections from the 
brainstem.  Insulin,  produced  by  the  pancreas  in  response  to  carbo-
hydrate and protein-rich meals, also has effects on the hypothalamic 
neurons controlling energy balance.

The  propeptide  pro-opiomelanocortin  (POMC)  is  expressed  in 
a  highly  restricted  population  of  hypothalamic  neurons  that  project 
widely throughout the brain (Fig. 401-3). These neurons are respon-
sive  to  the  endocrine  signals  described  above  and  are  critical  to  the 
regulation  of  energy  balance.  The  POMC-derived  peptides  α-  and 
β-melanocyte-stimulating  hormone  (MSH)  act  on  the  melanocortin 
4 receptor (MC4R) to regulate both food intake and aspects of energy 
expenditure  that  are  influenced  by  the  sympathetic  nervous  system.

responsive  to  metabolic  requirements.  No 
other  type  of  cell  is  specifically  designed  to 
store  fat  safely  in  this  manner,  and  many 
of  the  adverse  consequences  of  obesity  are 
likely  caused  not  by  having  too  much  fat  in 
adipocytes  but  by  “nonprofessional”  cells 
being  forced  to  take  up  and  store  fat.  Some 
new fat cells can be made in adulthood when 
~10%  of  our  fat  cell  population  turns  over 
every year.
 ■ THE CAUSES OF OBESITY: AN 
INTERACTION OF GENES AND 
ENVIRONMENT
For a person to become obese, energy intake 
must exceed energy expenditure in a manner 
that  is  sufficiently  sustained  to  result  in  the 
accumulation of a large excess of triglyceride 
in adipose tissue. As obesity is a cumulative 
pathology,  if  energy  intake  exceeds  energy 
expenditure  by  even  a  small  amount  (as  lit-
tle  as  7  kcal/d),  this  is  sufficient  to  develop 
obesity  over  a  matter  of  years  or  decades. 
Even  where  obesity  is  common,  there  are 
many  people  who  are  not  overweight.  Eco-
nomic  and  social  factors  are  likely  to  play  a 
role as there are more normal-weight people 
in  wealthier  and  more  socially  advantaged 
groups, at least in Western societies. It is also 
true, however, that because of discrimination, 
obese  people  may  become  socially  and  eco-
nomically disadvantaged, which complicates 
interpretation of that data. We can, however, 
state with considerable certainty that genetic 
factors play a major role in predisposing peo-
ple to a range of adiposity. We know this from 
a large number of studies comparing identi-
cal  and  nonidentical  twins.  It  is  particularly 
tellingly that the degree of adiposity in adult 
life of identical twins brought up in different 
families is very similar between the twins but 
is not at all correlated with that of the adop-
tive siblings with whom they were raised.
 ■ THE RELATIVE ROLES OF EXCESS INTAKE AND 
LOWER ENERGY EXPENDITURE IN CONFERRING 
BIOLOGIC PREDISPOSITION
Do these heritable factors influence energy intake, energy expenditure, 
or  both?  It  is  clear  that  by  the  time  a  person  is  obese  the  amount  of 
energy they expend in the resting state is more, not less, than a non-
obese  person.  However,  if  an  obese  person  loses  weight  by  dieting, 
there is some evidence that they tend to be more “energy efficient” 
than a person who has never been obese, particularly in terms of how 
many  calories  they  burn  during  a  defined  bout  of  muscular  activity. 
However, the effects are subtle. It seems very likely that there are some 
individuals  who  are  predominantly  predisposed  to  develop  obesity  by 
virtue of a lower metabolic rate, but thus far, apart from severe hypothy-
roidism, concrete examples are scarce. In contrast, a much more consis-
tent and compelling body of evidence supports the idea that the genetic 
predisposition to obesity is largely mediated through the brain’s control 
of  food  intake.  When  studied  in  controlled  settings,  individuals  who 
carry genetic variants that predispose to obesity tend to eat more and be 
less readily satiated. This is very readily demonstrable when the mutation 
has  a  major  effect  on  obesity  predisposition,  but  similar  data  are  now 
emerging in the case of common genetic variants with smaller effects.
 ■ ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS PREDISPOSING  
TO OBESITY
Obesity cannot exist in the absence of sufficient food to lay down and 
maintain excess fat stores. That fact not infrequently leads to the belief 

FIGURE 401-2  The homeostatic regulation of body weight. In most people, body weight remains stable over long 
periods of time despite fluctuations in the amount of food we eat and the amount of activity we undertake. This 
homeostatic regulation of body weight is controlled by the neurons in the hypothalamus, which receive hormonal 
signals from adipose tissue such as leptin and neural and hormonal signals from the gut in response to meals. 
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) and cholecystokinin (CCK) from enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine and 
peptide YY (PYY) and oxyntomodulin (OXM) from the large intestine are secreted in response to eating a meal and/
or the presence of nutrients in the intestinal lumen. Their release, together with neural signals from the vagus 
nerve and the enteric nervous system, contributes to satiety, acting on the hypothalamus via projections from the 
brainstem. Insulin, produced by the pancreas in response to carbohydrate- and protein-rich meals and potentiated 
by  the  action  of  some  of  the  gut  hormones,  also  has  effects  on  the  hypothalamic  neurons  controlling  energy 
balance. The release of the hormone ghrelin from the stomach increases in the unfed state and induces appetite 
by acting on hypothalamic neurons as well as on receptors in the brainstem.

γ-MSH, acting mostly through the MC3 receptor, appears to play more 
of a role in controlling linear growth and the disposition of nutrients 
into lean versus fat tissues. Signaling through both these melanocortin 
receptors is also subject to negative control by a different population of 
neurons, which make and release agouti-related peptide (AGRP), neu-
ropeptide  Y  (NPY),  and  the  inhibitory  neurotransmitter  γ-aminobu-
tyric acid (GABA). AGRP actively switches off melanocortin receptors. 
Leptin, which suppress food intake, simultaneously stimulates POMC 
neurons and inhibits NPY/AGRP neurons. Human energy balance is 
highly sensitive to signaling through this system as people who have a 
genetic defect in just one of the two copies of the MC4R gene are very 
prone to overeat (hyperphagia) and to gain weight.
 ■ THE PHYSIOLOGY OF NUTRIENT STORAGE IN 
ADIPOSE TISSUE
When  energy  intake  exceeds  energy  expenditure,  a  small  amount  of 
that excess energy is stored as glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle. But 
if the imbalance is greater, then our bodies are designed to store that 
excess energy in a more efficient way as triacylglycerol (triglyceride). 
This  fat  is  more  efficient  because,  unlike  glycogen,  it  does  not  need 
accompanying water, and when metabolized, it generates almost three 
times more energy per gram than does carbohydrate. Adipocytes (fat 
cells) have evolved to contain a highly specialized organelle, the unilo-
cular fat droplet, which holds the triglyceride within a single-layer of 
phospholipid  that  contains  all  the  components  needed  for  enzymes 
that  make  and  breakdown  triglycerides  in  a  manner  that  is  rapidly

There  is  much  current  investigation 
into  other  environmental  factors  that 
might influence the development of obe-
sity.  Heated  debates  continue  about  the 
optimal balance of macronutrients in the 
diet to maintain normal weight and good 
health.  Much  of  this  revolves  around  the 
potential benefits of reducing the relative 
proportion  of  carbohydrates  in  the  diet 
(Chap.  402).  There  seems  to  be  reason-
able  consensus  that,  in  the  short  term, 
diets  that  are  rich  in  protein  and  fat 
and  lower  in  carbohydrates  more  readily 
result  in  quick  weight  loss.  This  may  be 
because the appetite-suppressing gut hor-
mones  discussed  above  increase  more  in 
response to protein than to carbohydrate, 
thus  inducing  earlier  satiation.  However, 
longer-term studies to date are less com-
pelling,  and  the  long-term  increases  in 
protein  and  fat  intake  are  not  without  at 
least theoretical risks. A growing body of 
evidence suggests that exposures early in 
life, either in utero or in early postnatal life, 
might  “program”  individuals  to  develop 
obesity  and/or  cardiometabolic  disease 
through  effects  that  are  often  attributed 
to  “epigenetics”  (Chap.  483).  This  is  an 
attractive idea, and if true, it would mean 
that  time-limited  and  affordable  inter-
ventions  early  in  life  might  have  lifelong 
benefits. Inevitably, it will take time to see 
if  the  promise  of  such  interventions  will 
be  fulfilled.  Much  excitement  has  been 
generated by the increasing recognition of 
the diversity of our intestinal microbiome, 
which clearly has relevance to gastrointes-
tinal health (Chap. 471). At present, it is 
premature  to  ascribe  any  significant  role 
to the human microbiome in obesity or its 
adverse consequences.

FIGURE 401-3  Hypothalamic pathways regulating body weight. Neurons in the hypothalamus regulate energy intake 
and expenditure in response to leptin and other hormones. In the fed state, leptin stimulates primary neurons in the 
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus that express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). The POMC-derived peptides α- and 
β-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) act on the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) expressed on neurons in the 
paraventricular nucleus to reduce energy intake and increase energy expenditure. At the same time, leptin inhibits 
neurons  expressing  agouti-related  peptide  (AGRP),  which  switches  off  melanocortin  receptors.  When  these  and 
other key molecules, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and single minded-1 (SIM1), are disrupted by 
inherited mutations, affected individuals have hyperphagia and severe obesity.

that  the  principal  cause  of  obesity  must  be  either  the  obese  person’s 
ignorance of the role of excess caloric intake or their conscious choice 
to  prioritize  the  immediate  pleasures  of  eating  over  the  long-term 
health harms associated with obesity. Taken to extremes, these views 
can  engender  serious  social,  economic,  and  medical  discrimination 
against obese people. It is clear that genetic factors, however important 
they are in an individual’s predisposition to obesity, cannot explain the 
marked increase in obesity prevalence that has occurred in the past few 
decades. We have to look to an environment that has become increas-
ingly obesogenic to explain that phenomenon. In most developed and 
developing  countries,  energy-dense  and  highly  palatable  food  and 
beverages  have  been  aggressively  marketed,  made  cheaper  than  ever 
before,  provided  in  larger  portions,  and  made  available  ubiquitously 
and continuously. This has been combined with the reduction in phys-
ical activity in work and domestic life due to mechanization and the 
change in the nature of employment. Even the control of our external 
temperature  by  artificial  heating  and  cooling  has  meant  less  energy 
expended on thermoregulation. Taken together, these are likely to be 
the major factors driving the recent increase in obesity. It is important 
to  remember,  however,  that  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  populace 
remains normal weight under these circumstances and a large part of 
that is attributable to their genetic good fortune.

 ■ WHY DOESN’T LEPTIN 
PREVENT OBESITY?
Leptin is known to suppress food intake, 
and its levels rise as fat stores expand. So 
why does this not prevent us from becom-
ing obese? The most plausible explanation lies in the evolutionary his-
tory of leptin and the fact that it appears to defend strongly against the 
loss of body fat stores, with a fall in circulating leptin below a person’s 
habitual  level  being  a  powerful  stimulus  to  food  intake,  whereas  the 
response to rises in leptin above the normal level is less pronounced. 
At higher levels of leptin, administering extra amounts of the hormone 
may  have  no  discernible  effect  at  all—a  phenomenon  that  has  come 
to  be  called  leptin  resistance.  It  is  important  to  remember  that  even 
though  a  person  appears  to  be  leptin  resistant,  some  leptin  action  is 
occurring;  otherwise,  the  person  would  become  as  insatiably  hungry 
and progressively obese as someone with congenital leptin deficiency 
(see  below).  It  also  seems  likely  that  a  subgroup  of  people  may  have 
relatively low leptin levels, which plays a role in the etiology of their 
obesity.  There  are  likely  other  hormonal  signals  produced  in  severe 
obesity  that,  unlike  leptin,  continue  to  exert  a  suppressive  effect  on 
food intake and help to ensure that the expansion of adipose tissue does 
not become indefinitely cumulative.

 ■ SINGLE-GENE DISORDERS LEADING TO OBESITY
The assessment of severely obese children and, indeed, adults should be 
directed at screening for potentially treatable endocrine and neurologic 
conditions  and  identifying  genetic  conditions  so  that  appropriate

genetic counseling and, in some cases, treatment can be started. Clin-
ically, it remains useful to categorize the genetic obesity syndromes 
as  those  with  dysmorphism  and/or  developmental  delay  and  those 
without these features (Tables 401-1 and 401-2). Although individ-
ually these monogenic disorders are rare, cumulatively, up to 20% of 
children  with  severe  obesity  have  rare  chromosomal  abnormalities 
and/or  highly  penetrant  genetic  mutations  that  drive  their  obesity. 
This  figure  is  likely  to  increase  with  wider  accessibility  to  genetic 
testing  and  as  new  genes  are  identified.  A  genetic  diagnosis  can 
inform management (many such patients find it very difficult to lose 
weight through diet and exercise) and can inform clinical decision-
making regarding the use of bariatric surgery (feasible in some; high 
risk  in  others)  (Chap. 402). There are a number of drugs in clinical 
trials targeted specifically at patients with genetic obesity syndromes. 
Specifically, setmelanotide, a MC4R agonist, has been used effectively 
in phase 2/3 clinical trials in children who are genetically deficient in 
POMC or the leptin receptor. It is also being explored for the treatment 
of other genetic obesity syndromes affecting the melanocortin pathway.
 ■ CLASSICAL SYNDROMIC DISORDERS
A  number  of  syndromes  were  identified  by  clinicians  long  before 
their  exact  genetic  cause  was  known.  In  these  syndromes,  obesity  is 
associated with a stereotyped set of other anomalies, often neurode-
velopmental in type. The precise genetic basis for the majority of these 
syndromes is now known. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most 
common syndromic cause of obesity, with an estimated prevalence of 
~1 in 25,000. It is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by deletion 
of an imprinted region on the paternal chromosome 15 (Chap. 466). 
The  characteristic  clinical  features  are  hypotonia,  feeding  difficulties 
in  infancy,  developmental  delay,  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism, 
hyperphagia (increased food intake), and obesity. Children with PWS 
are  short  with  reduced  lean  body  mass  and  increased  fat  mass,  fea-
tures resembling those seen in growth hormone (GH) deficiency; GH 
treatment decreases body fat and increases linear growth and muscle 
mass and is now standard of care in this condition. Low levels of brain 
expression of the neuropeptide oxytocin and the nerve growth factor 
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in PWS patients have sug-
gested new therapeutic opportunities for these patients.

a  syndrome  known  as  Albright’s  hereditary  osteodystrophy  (AHO) 
(Chap.  412).  Maternal  transmission  of  GNAS1  mutations  leads  to 
AHO (characterized by short stature, obesity, and skeletal defects) plus 
resistance  to  several  hormones  (e.g.,  parathyroid  hormone),  whereas 
paternal transmission leads only to the AHO phenotype. The clinical 
spectrum  is  very  broad,  and  some  patients  may  present  with  obesity 
alone.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease charac-
terized by obesity, developmental delay, polydactyly, retinal dystrophy 
or  pigmentary  retinopathy,  hypogonadism,  and  renal  abnormalities. 
The  same  clinical  features  can  arise  from  mutations  in  >20  genes, 
which disrupt signaling in primary cilia. Overlapping clinical features 
are seen in a number of other genetic obesity syndromes (Table 401-1).
 ■ DISORDERS OF LEPTIN-MELANOCORTIN 
SIGNALING
Homozygous mutations that disrupt the production or action of leptin 
are rare but result in a disorder that is treatable. Children with homozy-
gous  loss-of-function  leptin  mutations  have  rapid  weight  gain  in  the 
first  few  months  of  life,  resulting  in  severe  obesity  due  to  an  intense 
drive  to  eat  (hyperphagia)  and  impaired  satiety  with  food-seeking 
behavior  soon  after  the  end  of  a  meal.  Congenital  leptin  deficiency 
can  be  treated  with  subcutaneous  injections  of  recombinant  leptin, 
which reduce hunger, increase satiety, and lead to weight loss. Similar 
clinical features are seen in patients with homozygous mutations in the 
leptin  receptor  gene,  but  they  are  not  responsive  to  leptin  treatment 
(Table  401-2).  Normal  pubertal  development  rarely  occurs  in  adults 
with  leptin  or  leptin  receptor  deficiency,  with  biochemical  evidence 
of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. However, there is some evidence

for the delayed but spontaneous onset of menses in a small number of 
leptin- and leptin receptor–deficient adults. Leptin treatment permits 
progression  of  pubertal  development,  suggesting  that  leptin  is  a  per-
missive factor for the development of puberty.

Homozygous  or  compound  heterozygous  mutations  in  POMC 
lead  to  hyperphagia  and  early-onset  obesity.  As  adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH) is produced in the pituitary gland by cleavage from 
POMC, patients also present with isolated ACTH deficiency (neonatal 
hypoglycemia  and  cholestatic  jaundice).  In  the  skin,  POMC-derived 
melanocortin  peptides  act  on  melanocortin  1  receptors  to  induce 
pigmentation.  For  this  reason,  the  lack  of  POMC-derived  peptides 
in obese patients with POMC deficiency results in hypopigmentation 
of  skin  and  hair,  which  is  more  noticeable  in  people  of  Caucasian 
ancestry who often have red hair. Prohormone convertase 1 (PCSK1) 
is an enzyme involved in the cleavage of POMC into ACTH, which is 
then further cleaved to make α-MSH by carboxypeptidase E. Impaired 
processing of POMC contributes to the hyperphagic severe early-onset 
obesity and ACTH deficiency in people lacking PCSK1 who also have 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, postprandial hypoglycemia (due to 
impaired processing of proinsulin to insulin), and a neonatal enterop-
athy in early childhood. Heterozygous mutations that impair the func-
tion  of  MC4R  are  found  in  5–6%  of  patients  with  severe  early-onset 
obesity  and  at  a  frequency  of  ~1  in  300  in  the  general  population, 
making  this  the  most  common  gene  in  which  variants  contribute  to 
obesity. MC4R mutations are inherited in a co-dominant manner, with 
variable penetrance and expression in heterozygous carriers; homozy-
gous carriers are severely obese. Patients are often hyperphagic from 
early  childhood  and  hyperinsulinemic  and  have  increased  lean  mass 
and increased linear growth.

 ■ GENETIC SUBTYPES OF OBESITY ASSOCIATED 
WITH NEUROBEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES
Both PWS patients and patients with mutations in SIM1 (a gene that 
acts  downstream  of  MC4R)  exhibit  a  spectrum  of  behavioral  abnor-
malities that overlap with autism-like features that could be related to 
reduced  oxytocin  signaling  (Table  401-2).  Mutations  affecting  BDNF 
and  its  receptor  tropomyosin  receptor  kinase  B  (TrkB)  cause  speech 
and language delay, hyperphagia, and severe obesity, as well as hyper-
activity, autistic traits, and impaired short-term memory. Interestingly, 
a common variant in BDNF (V66M), found in heterozygous form in 
~20% of the population, is associated with a number of traits and neu-
ropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. Chromoso-
mal deletion and mutations affecting Src-homology-2 (SH2) B-adaptor 
protein-1  (SH2B1)  are  associated  with  dominantly  inherited,  severe, 
early-onset  obesity,  disproportionate  insulin  resistance,  early-onset 
type 2 diabetes, and behavioral problems including aggressive behavior.

 ■ OBESITY SECONDARY TO OTHER DISORDERS
Endocrine  Disorders  Patients  with  hypothyroidism  may  gain 
weight and become obese, although it is rarely the sole cause of severe 
obesity. It is nonetheless prudent always to measure thyroid function in 
a patient presenting with obesity. Measurement of thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH) will detect significant primary disease of the thyroid, 
but  for  rare  secondary  hypothyroidism,  additional  measurement  of 
free thyroxine levels is needed (Chap. 383). Weight gain can also be a 
presenting  feature  of  Cushing’s  syndrome.  Clinically,  the  presence  of 
spontaneous  bruising,  livid  striae,  myopathy,  and  marked  centripetal 
distribution of body fat help to distinguish true endogenous hypercor-
tisolism  from  common  obesity.  This  condition  is  usually  reasonably 
straightforward  to  diagnose  based  on  tests  that  approximate  cortisol 
production rates (24-h urine free cortisol) or the suppression of serum 
cortisol by dexamethasone (Chap. 386). Occasionally, in severely obese 
patients, effects of adiposity on glucocorticoid metabolism can make 
it difficult to interpret results, and more sophisticated tests, including 
those measuring diurnal rhythm of cortisol, may be necessary to estab-
lish or exclude the diagnosis with confidence. Weight gain can also be 
a presenting feature of patients with insulinoma, driven largely by the 
need to eat more frequently than normal to avoid hypoglycemia.

Hypothalamic  Damage  The  hypothalamic  regions  that  con-
trol  energy  balance  can  be  disrupted  by  tumors  (such  as  cranio-
pharyngiomas),  inflammatory  masses,  or  after  a  severe  head  injury  
(Chap. 379). In such cases, there is often some accompanying evidence 
of  disruption  of  the  hormonal  functions  of  the  anterior  or  posterior 
pituitary, although it may be subtle and the history of hyperphagia and 
weight gain is often short. It is worth noting that in common obesity, 
GH levels in response to provocative testing may be somewhat lower 
than  normal,  but  this  does  not  necessarily  suggest  the  presence  of  a 
structural lesion.
 ■ ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF OBESITY
Mechanistic  Considerations  Obesity  is  associated  with  a  wide 
range of pathologies that can adversely impact morbidity and mortality 
(Chap. 408). Some of these consequences are related, at least in part, to 
the direct mechanical or gravitational effects of the expanded fat mass 
itself (Fig. 401-4). However, the principal mechanisms behind many of 
the complications of obesity are less likely to be due to the expanded fat 
mass itself but more closely related to the chronic state of overnutrition 
itself and its effects on tissues throughout the body.

As people become obese, one of the first and most prominent biochem-
ical  abnormalities  that  develops  is  the  need  for  increased  circulating 
concentrations of insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis. This state 
of  insulin  resistance  generally  worsens  with  a  greater  degree  of  obe-
sity, but there is a high degree of interindividual variability. It is more 
prominent  when  fat  is  distributed  more  centrally.  Insulin  resistance/
hyperinsulinemia is likely to play a major role in the predisposition to 
metabolic endocrine and cardiovascular diseases seen more frequently 
in obesity and may even play a role in the predisposition of obese peo-
ple to develop certain cancers.

The main sites of insulin action in the body are the liver and skeletal 
muscle. Thus, for insulin resistance to be discernible at the level of the 
whole body, the action of insulin must be disturbed in one or both of 
these tissues. It seems unlikely that an expanded fat cell mass would do 
that directly. How then does obesity lead to a state of insulin resistance?

characterizes  obesity  predisposes  to  certain  obesity-related  complications  (e.g., 
osteoarthritis  of  knees,  reflux  esophagitis,  and  obstructive  sleep  apnea)  directly 
through its mass and/or volume. However, in the case of the metabolic, endocrine, 
and cardiovascular complications, the link is less clear. Further research is needed 
to  establish  whether  some  features  of  the  expanded  fat  mass  influence  the 
development  of  these  complications  or  whether  other  aspects  of  the  chronically 
overnourished state, such as excess fat outside the fat depot, are more relevant.

One  hypothesis  suggests  a  leading  role  for  the 
inflammation that occurs in the adipose tissue in 
obesity (Fig. 401-5). This undoubtedly happens, 
as  there  are  more  macrophages  in  obese  than 
nonobese  adipose  tissues,  and  this  is  associated 
with  higher  levels  of  inflammatory  markers  in 
the circulation of obese people. The majority of 
macrophages  in  obese  adipose  tissue  are  found 
in  clusters  around  dead  or  dying  adipocytes, 
so  it  appears  that  these  cells  are  clearing  debris 
after cell death. Studies in animal models provide 
strong  support  for  the  notion  that  this  inflam-
matory state is mechanistically linked to insulin 
resistance, but evidence from humans for this is 
not as strong.

An alternative hypothesis is that as individuals 
becomes  more  obese  they  become  less  able  to 
safely store nutrients in their adipose tissue and 
begin to redirect macronutrients to other tissues 
that are not designed for fat storage and may be 
damaged  by  the  nutrient  excess.  This  certainly 
happens  to  people  who  are  born  with  a  lack  of 
adipose tissue (lipodystrophy) who, early in life, 
develop  severe  versions  all  the  metabolic  com-
plications  that  are  seen  in  obesity  as  they  have 
no safe depot in which to store excess nutrients. 
There are stronger human data from both genetic 
and  pharmacologic  studies  for  the  existence  of 
the  latter  mechanism.  How  ectopic  fat  leads  to 
insulin  resistance  and  other  damaging  effects  is 
still a puzzle, but it is very likely a major driver of 
pathology associated with obesity.

FIGURE  401-5  How  does  obesity  cause  metabolic  disease?  Insulin  resistance  is  one  of  the  earliest 
complications of obesity and underlies and precedes many of its adverse health consequences. The disposal 
and production of glucose by the most important tissues, muscle and liver, respectively, become less sensitive 
to insulin, and this results in a compensatory increase in insulin secretion from the pancreas. There are two 
main theories for the association of obesity with insulin resistance. In the first, products of macrophages and 
other inflammatory cells that are more abundant in obese adipose tissue can, through paracrine or endocrine 
routes, disturb insulin’s action in muscle and liver cells. In the second, as adipose storage deposits fill up, they 
become less able to take on excessive calories, which end up being stored as ectopic lipid in tissues such as 
muscle and liver, which are not primarily designed to store nutrients of this type. The evidence in humans is 
stronger for the latter hypothesis.

Metabolic  Complications  •  DYSLIPIDEMIA  
The insulin resistance of obesity is frequently asso-
ciated  with  dyslipidemia  characterized  by  high  circulating  triglycerides 
and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Chap. 407). Occasionally, 
the  hypertriglyceridemia  may  be  severe  enough  to  put  the  patient  at 
risk  of  pancreatitis.  Although  there  is  a  relationship  between  obesity 
and  raised  circulating  levels  of  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol 
(which  is  the  major  risk  factor  for  coronary  artery  disease),  genetic 
factors  independent  of  obesity  and  the  type  of  dietary  fat  consumed 
probably have an even greater impact.

FATTY  LIVER  DISEASE  Obesity  is  strongly  associated  with  the  pres-
ence of ectopic fat in hepatocytes. This can progress to nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis  (NASH),  which  can  progress  to  the  fibrosis,  which 
is  a  precursor  to  cirrhosis  (Chap.  343).  The  reported  incidence  of 
NASH-related cirrhosis and of hepatocellular carcinoma has increased 
markedly in step with the increase in the prevalence of obesity in ado-
lescents and adults.

TYPE  2  DIABETES  The  insulin  resistance  characteristic  of  the  over-
nourished  state  strongly  predisposes  to  the  development  of  type  2 
diabetes  in  people  who,  largely  for  genetic  reasons,  are  less  able  to 
maintain  the  high  levels  of  insulin  secretion  over  many  decades. 
Impaired  glucose  tolerance  and  type  2  diabetes  are  among  the  most 
common complications of obesity (Chap. 403).

Endocrine  Complications 
In  females,  the  insulin  resistance/
hyperinsulinemia  frequently  found  in  obesity  strongly  predisposes 
to  the  development  of  polycystic  ovaries,  characterized  by  irregular 
menstruation,  anovulatory  infertility,  and  hirsutism  due  to  hyperan-
drogenism. In males, obesity is more often associated with a degree of 
central hypogonadism, where low circulating testosterone is associated 
with  levels  of  luteinizing  hormone  and  follicle-stimulating  hormone 
that do not rise appropriately to compensate for the testosterone-de-
ficient state

Dermatologic  Complications  Obesity  can  result  in  problems 
with excessive skin folds that can cause discomfort through mechanical 

irritation and can also become infected with fungi. Insulin resistance/
hyperinsulinemia is associated with acanthosis nigricans, where areas 
such as axilla, groin, and the back of neck develop velvety hyperpig-
mentation. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a potentially disabling skin con-
dition strongly associated with obesity. It is characterized by recurrent 
boils  often  with  chronically  draining  sinus  tracts  affecting  skin  areas 
containing apocrine sweat glands.
Cardiovascular Complications  Obese people, even if they do not 
have diabetes, have increased morbidity and mortality from atheroth-
rombotic  vascular  disease,  including  coronary  artery  disease  and 
stroke. The factors that result in this are complex and involve increased 
prevalence  of  hypertension,  dyslipidemia,  and  insulin  resistance/
hyperinsulinemia. The rare condition of thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura, which causes microvascular platelet thrombosis, thrombocy-
topenia, and hemolytic anemia due to the presence of abnormally large 
von Willebrand factor multimers, is strongly associated with obesity.

Independent  of  occlusive  arterial  disease,  obese  people  are  also  at 
increased  risk  of  heart  failure,  particularly  characterized  primarily 
by  diastolic  dysfunction,  and  of  atrial  fibrillation,  the  most  common 
arrhythmia.
Respiratory  Complications  Exertional  dyspnea  is  common  in 
obesity,  contributed  to  by  the  increased  work  required  to  move  a 
greater  mass  as  well  as  impacts  of  pressure  on  the  diaphragm  and 
thoracic cage on chest wall compliance. Enlargement of soft tissue of 
the mouth and throat and adipose depots around the airways contrib-
ute to the high prevalence of sleep apnea, although other factors may 
contribute  to  some  forms,  where  central  nocturnal  hypoventilation 
also occurs.
Gastrointestinal Disorders  Reflux esophagitis is the most com-
mon  gastrointestinal  complication  of  obesity,  particularly  occurring 
in those with high intraabdominal pressure. Gallstones are also more 
common  in  obese  people,  bringing  increased  risks  of  biliary  colic, 
cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and gallbladder cancer.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismRheumatologic  Disorders  Osteoarthritis  of  the  knee  and  gout 
are  the  two  most  common  rheumatologic  conditions  clearly  associ-
ated  with  obesity.  Interestingly,  despite  obesity  being  described  as  a 
proinflammatory  state,  there  is  no  evidence  for  an  increase  in  rheu-
matoid arthritis or the seronegative arthritides among people who are  
obese.

Cancers  Obesity is a risk factor for a number of common cancers. 
Indeed, it has recently been calculated that, at least in some countries, 
obesity has overtaken smoking as the greatest risk factor for developing 
cancer. Recent research has found that as the BMI increases by 5 kg/m2, 
cancer mortality increases by 10%. The largest effects are on colorec-
tal, kidney, and pancreatic cancer, adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, 
and, in women, endometrial carcinoma. The recent rapid increase in 
the  prevalence  of  esophageal  adenocarcinoma  is  likely  related  to  the 
marked recent increase in reflux esophagitis due to the raised intraab-
dominal  pressure  (with  or  without  hiatus  hernia)  characteristic  of 
central obesity.

Response to Infection  The fact that obesity can influence the out-
come of some infections has become very apparent with the COVID-
19  pandemic.  Obese  patients  have  a  substantially  worse  outcome  if 
infected by SARS-CoV-2 through mechanisms that are as yet unclear. 
Obese patients also appear to be more susceptible to bacterial wound 
infections and postoperative sepsis.

Disorders of the Central Nervous System  There is increasing 
evidence that obesity is a risk factor for dementia in later life, although 
how that risk is mediated is not clear. Idiopathic intracranial hyperten-
sion is a rare disorder that is strongly associated with obesity.

 ■ CONCLUSION
Obesity is a medical disorder that has been greatly increasing in prev-
alence due to environmental factors that are ubiquitous in developed 
and developing countries. However, it is important to bear in mind that 
it is a highly heterogeneous condition, which in some people is attrib-
utable entirely to genetic causes, and that underlying genetic variation 
strongly influences the risk of obesity in all people. It is a serious con-
dition  leading  to  multiple  adverse  health  outcomes  and  considerable 
human suffering. As our understanding of its pathogenesis increases, 
our  duty  to  treat  obese  patients  with  understanding  and  compassion 
and to develop new and better options for its treatment and prevention 
is worthy of emphasis.

402 Evaluation and  

Management of Obesity
Robert F. Kushner

More than 70% of U.S. adults are considered to be overweight or have 
obesity, and the prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly in most of 
the industrialized world. Children and adolescents also are becoming 
more  obese,  indicating  that  the  current  trends  will  accelerate  over 
time.  Obesity  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  multiple  health 
problems,  including  hypertension,  type  2  diabetes,  dyslipidemia, 
obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, degenerative 
joint disease, and some malignancies. Thus, it is important for health 
care providers to identify, evaluate, and treat patients for obesity and 
associated comorbid conditions.

 ■ EVALUATION
Health care providers should screen all adult patients for obesity and 
offer intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sus-
tained weight loss. The four main steps in the evaluation of obesity, as 
described below, are (1) a focused obesity-related history that includes 
lifestyle questions about diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress; (2) a 
physical examination to determine the degree and type of obesity; (3) 
assessment of comorbid conditions; and (4) assessment of the patient’s 
readiness to adopt lifestyle changes.

The Obesity-Focused History  The  first  step  in  taking  an  obe-
sity-focused history is to approach the topic in a sensitive manner. The 
reason  for  this  concern  is  that  the  word  obesity  is  a  highly  charged, 
emotive term. It has a significant pejorative meaning for many patients, 
leaving them feeling judged and blamed when labeled as such. This is 
not the case when patients are told that they have other chronic dis-
eases such as diabetes or hypertension. Patients prefer that clinicians 
use  more  neutral  words  or  terms  such  as  weight,  excess  weight,  body 
mass index (BMI), or unhealthy weight, versus more stigmatizing terms 
such as obesity, morbid obesity, or fatness.

Information  from  the  history  should  address  the  following  seven 

questions:

•	 What factors contribute to the patient’s obesity?
•	 How is the obesity affecting the patient’s health?
•	 What is the patient’s level of risk from obesity?
•	 What does the patient find difficult about managing weight?
•	 What are the patient’s goals and expectations?
•	 Is the patient motivated to begin a weight management program?
•	 What kind of help does the patient need?

Although  the  vast  majority  of  cases  of  obesity  are  promoted  by 
behavioral factors that affect diet and physical activity patterns, the his-
tory may suggest secondary causes that merit further evaluation. Disor-
ders to consider include polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypothyroidism, 
Cushing’s syndrome, and hypothalamic disease. Drug-induced weight 
gain  also  should  be  considered.  Common  causes  include  medica-
tions  for  diabetes  (insulin,  sulfonylureas,  thiazolidinediones),  steroid 
hormones,  antipsychotic  agents  (clozapine,  olanzapine,  risperidone), 
mood  stabilizers  (lithium),  antidepressants  (tricyclics,  monoamine 
oxidase  inhibitors,  paroxetine,  mirtazapine),  and  antiepileptic  drugs 
(valproate,  gabapentin,  carbamazepine).  Other  medications,  such  as 
nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  and  calcium  channel  blockers, 
may cause peripheral edema but do not increase body fat.

The patient’s current diet and physical activity patterns may reveal 
factors  that  contribute  to  the  development  of  obesity  and  may  iden-
tify  behaviors  to  target  for  treatment.  Physical  fitness,  in  particular, 
is  an  important  predictor  of  all-cause  mortality  rate  independent  of 
BMI  and  body  composition  and  highlights  the  importance  of  taking 
a physical activity and exercise history during examination as well as 
emphasizing physical activity as a treatment approach.

Inquiring  about  sleep  health  that  addresses  regularity,  duration, 
efficiency, and satisfaction is also important. Although the mechanisms 
are uncertain, sleep deprivation is associated with metabolic alterations 
in appetite regulation, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, insulin 
sensitivity, and changes in circadian rhythm. Stress may also contribute 
to  obesity,  in  part  due  to  activation  of  the  adrenal  cortical  axis  and 
elevated cortisol levels and its impact on emotional health and behav-
iors. This historic information is best obtained by the combination of a 
questionnaire and an interview.

BMI and Waist Circumference  Three key anthropometric mea-
surements  are  important  in  evaluating  the  degree  of  obesity:  weight, 
height, and waist circumference. The BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/
height  (m)2  or  as  weight  (lb)/height  (in)2  ×  703,  is  used  to  classify 
weight status and risk of disease (Table 402-1). BMI is highly correlated 
with body fat and is related to disease risk. Lower BMI thresholds for 
overweight and obesity have been proposed for the Asia-Pacific region 
since this population appears to be at risk for glucose and lipid abnor-
malities at lower body weights.

Excess  abdominal  fat,  assessed  by  measurement  of  waist  circum-
ference,  is  independently  associated  with  a  higher  risk  for  metabolic 
syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Measurement 
of  the  waist  circumference  is  a  surrogate  for  visceral  adipose  tissue 
and should be performed in the horizontal plane above the iliac crest 
(Table 402-2).

Obesity-Associated Comorbid Conditions  The  evaluation  of 
comorbid  conditions  should  be  based  on  presentation  of  symptoms,

risk  factors,  and  index  of  suspicion.  For  all  patients,  a  fasting  lipid 
profile  (total,  low-density  lipoprotein,  and  high-density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol  and  triglyceride  levels),  chemistry  panel,  and  glycated 
hemoglobin  should  be  performed,  and  blood  pressure  determined. 
Symptoms  and  diseases  that  are  directly  or  indirectly  related  to  obe-
sity are listed in Table 402-3. Although individuals vary, the number 
and  severity  of  organ-specific  comorbid  conditions  usually  rise  with 
increasing levels of obesity.

Identifying  the  High-Risk  Patient  Efforts  are  under  way  to 
develop more practical and useful assessments to identify patients who 
are  at  high  risk  in  addition  to  using  BMI  alone.  Analogous  to  other 
staging systems commonly used for congestive heart failure or chronic 
kidney  disease,  the  American  Association  of  Clinical  Endocrinology 
(AACE)  and  the  American  College  of  Endocrinology  (ACE)  guide-
lines  advocate  a  simple  and  clinically  useful  obesity  disease  staging 
system that is based on ethnic-specific BMI cutoffs in conjunction with 
assessment for adiposity-related complications (Fig. 402-1). Stage 0 is 
assigned  to  individuals  who  are  overweight  or  obese  by  BMI  classifi-
cation but have no complications, whereas stages 1 and 2 are defined 
as individuals who are overweight or obese by BMI classification and 
have one or more mild-moderate complications (stage 1) or at least one 
severe complication (stage 2). A different functional staging system for 
obesity, called the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS), classifies 
individuals with obesity into five graded categories (0–4), based on their 
morbidity and health-risk profile along three domains—medical, func-
tional, and mental. In this system, staging occurs independent of BMI.

to frustration and may hamper future weight-loss efforts. Assessment 
includes patient motivation and support, stressful life events, psychi-
atric  status,  time  availability  and  constraints,  and  appropriateness  of 
goals and expectations. Readiness can be viewed as the balance of two 
opposing forces: (1) motivation, or the patient’s desire to change; and 
(2) resistance, or the patient’s resistance to change.

A helpful method to begin a readiness assessment is to use the moti-
vational  interviewing  technique  of  “anchoring”  the  patient’s  interest 
and confidence to change on a numerical scale. With this technique, 
the patient is asked to rate—on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being not so 
important (or confident) and 10 being very important (or confident)—
his or her level of interest in and confidence about losing weight at this 
time. This exercise helps establish readiness to change and also serves 
as a basis for further dialogue.

TREATMENT
Obesity

THE GOAL OF THERAPY
The  primary  goals  of  treatment  are  to  improve  obesity-related 
comorbid conditions and quality of life and reduce the risk of devel-
oping  future  obesity-related  complications.  Information  obtained 
from  the  history,  physical  examination,  and  diagnostic  tests  is 
used to determine risk and develop a treatment plan (Fig. 402-2). 
The  decision  of  how  aggressively  to  treat  the  patient  and  which 
modalities to use is determined by the patient’s risk status, expec-
tations,  and  available  resources.  Not  all  patients  who  are  deemed 
obese by BMI screening need to be treated, since BMI alone does 
not  directly  measure  body  fat,  distinguish  body  fat  distribution, 
or  assess  an  individuals’  health  status.  However,  patients  who 
present  with  obesity-related  comorbidities  and  who  would  bene-
fit  from  weight-loss  intervention  should  be  managed  proactively. 
Therapy  for  obesity  always  begins  with  lifestyle  management  and 
may  include  pharmacotherapy  or  bariatric  surgery,  depending  on 
BMI risk category (Table 402-4). Setting an initial weight-loss goal 
of 8–10% over 6 months is a realistic target.

LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT
Obesity  care  involves  attention  to  three  essential  elements  of  life-
style:  dietary  habits,  physical  activity,  and  behavior  modification. 
Because  obesity  is  fundamentally  a  disease  of  energy  imbalance, 
all patients must learn how and when energy is consumed (diet), 
how and when energy is expended (physical activity), and how to 
incorporate this information into their daily lives (behavioral ther-
apy). Lifestyle management has been shown to result in a modest 
(typically  3–5  kg)  weight  loss  when  compared  with  no  treatment 
or usual care. 
Diet Therapy  The primary focus of diet therapy is to reduce overall 
calorie  consumption.  Guidelines  from  the  American  Heart  Associ-
ation/American  College  of  Cardiology/The  Obesity  Society  (AHA/
ACC/TOS) recommend initiating treatment with a calorie deficit of 
500–750  kcal/d  compared  with  the  patient’s  habitual  diet.  Alterna-
tively, a diet of 1200–1500 kcal/d for women and 1500–1800 kcal/d 
for men (adjusted for the individual’s body weight) can be prescribed. 
This reduction is consistent with a goal of losing ~1–2 lb/week. The 
calorie  deficit  can  be  instituted  through  dietary  substitutions  or 
alternatives. Examples include choosing smaller portion sizes, eating 
more  fruits  and  vegetables,  consuming  more  whole-grain  cereals, 
selecting leaner cuts of meat and skimmed dairy products, reducing 
consumption  of  fried  foods  and  other  foods  with  added  fats  and 
oils, and drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages. It is 
important that dietary counseling remains patient centered and that 
the selected goals are SMART (specific, measurable, agreed upon, 
realistic, timely).

The  macronutrient  composition  of  the  diet  will  vary  with  the 
patient’s preference and medical condition. The 2020 U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines for Americans  (Chap. 332), 
which focus on health promotion and risk reduction, can be applied 
to treatment of patients who are overweight or obese. The recom-
mendations  include  maintaining  a  diet  rich  in  whole  grains, 
fruits,  vegetables,  and  dietary  fiber;  decreasing  sodium  intake  to 
<2300  mg/d;  consuming  fat-free  or  low-fat  dairy  products;  and 
keeping added sugars and saturated fat intake to <10% of daily cal-
ories. Application of these guidelines to specific calorie goals can be

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismfound on the website www.choosemyplate.gov. Since portion control 
is one of the most difficult strategies for patients to manage, the use 
of preprepared products such as meal replacements is a simple and 
convenient  suggestion.  Examples  include  frozen  entrees,  protein 
shakes,  and  bars.  Use  of  meal  replacements  in  the  diet  has  been 
shown to result in a 7–8% weight loss.

Numerous randomized trials comparing diets of different macro-
nutrient  composition  (e.g.,  low-carbohydrate,  low-fat,  Mediterra-
nean) have shown that weight loss depends primarily on reduction 
of total caloric intake and adherence to the prescribed diet, not the 
specific  proportions  of  carbohydrate,  fat,  and  protein  in  the  diet. 
The  macronutrient  composition  will  ultimately  be  determined   
by the patient’s taste preferences, cooking style, and culture. How-
ever, the patient’s underlying medical problems are also important 
in  guiding  the  recommended  dietary  composition.  The  dietary 
prescription  will  vary  according  to  the  patient’s  metabolic  profile 
and risk factors. A consultation with a registered dietitian for med-
ical  nutrition  therapy  is  particularly  useful  in  considering  patient 
preference and treatment of comorbid diseases.

Another dietary approach to consider is based on the concept of 
energy density, which refers to the number of calories (i.e., amount 
of energy) a food contains per unit of weight. People tend to ingest 
a  constant  volume  of  food  regardless  of  caloric  or  macronutrient 
content. Adding water or fiber to a food decreases its energy density 
by increasing weight without affecting caloric content. Examples of 
foods with low energy density include soups, fruits, vegetables, oat-
meal, and lean meats. Dry foods and high-fat foods such as pretzels, 
cheese,  egg  yolks,  potato  chips,  and  red  meat  have  a  high  energy 
density. Diets containing low-energy-dense foods have been shown 
to control hunger and thus to result in decreased caloric intake and 
weight loss.

Occasionally, very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) are prescribed as a 
form of aggressive dietary therapy. The primary purpose of a VLCD 
is  to  promote  a  rapid  and  significant  (13-  to  23-kg)  short-term 
weight loss over a 3- to 6-month period. The proprietary formulas 
designed  for  this  purpose  typically  supply  ≤800  kcal,  50–80  g  of 
protein,  and  100%  of  the  recommended  daily  intake  for  vitamins 
and minerals. According to a review by the National Task Force on 
the Prevention and Treatment of Obesity, indications for initiating 
a VLCD include the involvement of well-motivated individuals who 
are moderately to severely obese, have failed at more conservative 
approaches to weight loss, and have a medical condition that would 
be immediately improved with rapid weight loss. These conditions 
include  poorly  controlled  type  2  diabetes,  hypertriglyceridemia, 
obstructive sleep apnea, and symptomatic peripheral edema. In the 
DiRECT  trial  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  and  obesity,  a  low- 
energy formula diet (825–853 kcal/d) was administered for 3 months 
following by a structured monthly program. At 12 months, almost 
half  of  the  participants  achieved  remission  to  a  nondiabetic  state 
and were not taking antidiabetic drugs. Use of formula diets should 
be  prescribed  by  trained  practitioners  in  a  medical  care  setting 
where medical monitoring and high-intensity lifestyle intervention 
can be provided. 

Physical Activity Therapy  Although exercise alone is only mod-
erately effective for weight loss, the combination of dietary modifi-
cation and exercise is the most effective behavioral approach for the 
treatment of obesity. The most important role of exercise appears to 
be in the maintenance of the weight loss. The 2018 Physical Activity 
Guidelines  for  Americans  (www.health.gov/paguidelines)  recom-
mend that adults should engage in 150 min of moderate-intensity 
or 75 min a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per 
week, preferably spread throughout the week. Focusing on simple 
ways to add physical activity into the normal daily routine through 
leisure  activities,  travel,  and  domestic  work  should  be  suggested. 
Examples include brisk walking, using the stairs, doing housework 
and yard work, and engaging in sports. Additionally, it is important 
to  reduce  sedentary  behavior,  which  is  associated  with  all-cause 
mortality  and  cardiovascular  disease  mortality  in  adults.  Asking

the patient to wear a pedometer or accelerometer to monitor total 
accumulation of steps or kcal expended as part of the activities of 
daily  living  is  a  useful  strategy.  Step  counts  are  highly  correlated 
with activity level. Studies have demonstrated that lifestyle activities 
are as effective as structured exercise programs for improving cardi-
orespiratory fitness and weight loss. A high level of physical activity 
(>300 min of moderate-intensity activity per week) is often needed 
to lose weight and sustain weight loss. These exercise recommen-
dations are daunting to most patients and need to be implemented 
gradually.  Consultation  with  an  exercise  physiologist  or  personal 
trainer may be helpful. 
Behavioral Therapy  Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to help 
change and reinforce new dietary and physical activity behaviors. 
Strategies  include  self-monitoring  techniques  (e.g.,  journaling, 
weighing,  and  measuring  food  and  activity);  stress  management; 
stimulus  control  (e.g.,  using  smaller  plates,  not  eating  in  front  of 
the  television  or  in  the  car);  social  support;  problem  solving;  and 
cognitive restructuring to help patients develop more positive and 
realistic  thoughts  about  themselves.  When  recommending  any 
behavioral lifestyle change, the patient should be asked to identify 
what,  when,  where,  and  how  the  behavioral  change  will  be  per-
formed. The patient should keep a record of the anticipated behav-
ioral change so that progress can be reviewed at the next office visit. 
Because these techniques are time consuming to implement, their 
supervision is often undertaken by ancillary office staff, such as an 
advanced practice provider or registered dietitian. 

PHARMACOTHERAPY
Adjuvant  pharmacologic  treatments  should  be  considered  for 
patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 or for patients with a BMI ≥27 kg/m2  
who  have  concomitant  obesity-related  diseases  and  for  whom 
dietary and physical activity therapy has not been successful. When 
an antiobesity medication is prescribed, patients should be actively 
engaged in a lifestyle program that provides the strategies and skills 
needed to use the drug effectively since such support increases total 
weight loss.

Medications for obesity fall into two major categories: those that 
affect  appetite  and  those  that  inhibit  gastrointestinal  fat  absorp-
tion.  Since  2012,  four  new  appetite-controlling  medications  were 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with 
an  indication  for  chronic  weight  management,  although  one  was 
voluntarily withdrawn in February 2020. These medications work 
biologically  to  suppress  appetite,  affecting  hunger,  satiety,  and 
response  to  highly  rewarding  foods,  thus  making  it  easier  for 
patients to follow their dietary intentions to restrict caloric intake. 
In  addition,  one  capsule  that  is  considered  a  medical  device  was 
marketed in 2020. 

Centrally  Acting  Medications  This  class  of  medications  affects 
satiety (feeling of fullness after a meal), hunger (the biologic sensa-
tion that prompts eating), and craving (intense desire for a specific 
food).  By  controlling  appetite,  these  agents  help  patients  reduce 
caloric  intake  without  a  sense  of  deprivation.  The  target  site  for 
the  actions  of  these  medications  is  primarily  the  hypothalamus 
and  reward  centers  in  the  central  nervous  system  (Chap.  401). 
The  classic  sympathomimetic  adrenergic  agents  (benzphetamine, 
phendimetrazine,  diethylpropion,  mazindol,  and  phentermine) 
function  by  stimulating  norepinephrine  release  or  by  blocking  its 
reuptake. Among these agents, phentermine is the most commonly 
prescribed;  there  are  limited  long-term  data  on  its  effectiveness. 
A  2002  review  of  six  randomized,  placebo-controlled  trials  of 
phentermine  for  weight  control  found  that  patients  lost  0.6–6.0 
additional  kg  of  weight  over  2–24  weeks  of  treatment.  The  most 
common side effects of the amphetamine-derived agents are rest-
lessness,  insomnia,  dry  mouth,  constipation,  and  increased  blood 
pressure and heart rate.

PHEN/TPM is a combination drug that contains a catecholamine 
releaser (phentermine) and an anticonvulsant (topiramate). Topira-
mate is approved by the FDA as an anticonvulsant for the treatment

of epilepsy and for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. Weight 
loss  was  identified  as  an  unintended  side  effect  of  topiramate 
during  clinical  trials  for  epilepsy.  The  mechanism  responsible  for 
weight loss is uncertain but is thought to be mediated through the 
drug’s modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors, inhibition of 
carbonic  anhydrase,  and  antagonism  of  glutamate.  PHEN/TPM 
has undergone two 1-year pivotal randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind trials of efficacy and safety: EQUIP and CONQUER. 
In a third study, SEQUEL, 78% of CONQUER participants contin-
ued  to  receive  their  blinded  treatment  for  an  additional  year.  All 
participants received diet and exercise counseling. Participant num-
bers,  eligibility,  characteristics,  and  weight-loss  outcomes  are  dis-
played in Table 402-5. Intention-to-treat 1-year placebo-subtracted 
weight  loss  for  PHEN/TPM  was  9.3%  (15-mg/92-mg  dose)  and 
6.6% (7.5-mg/46-mg dose), respectively, in the EQUIP and CON-
QUER trials. Clinical and statistical dose-dependent improvements 
were seen in selected cardiovascular and metabolic outcome mea-
surements that were related to the weight loss. The most common 
adverse  events  experienced  by  the  drug-randomized  group  were 
paresthesias,  dry  mouth,  constipation,  dysgeusia,  and  insomnia. 
Because of an increased risk of congenital fetal oral-cleft formation 
from topiramate, women of childbearing age should have a negative 
pregnancy  test  before  treatment  and  monthly  thereafter  and  use 
effective contraception consistently during medication therapy.

Lorcaserin  was  approved  by  the  FDA  for  chronic  weight  man-
agement in 2012 and taken off the market in 2020. Lorcaserin was 
developed as a selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist with a functional 
selectivity ~15 times that of 5-HT2A receptors and 100 times that of 
5-HT2B receptors. This selectivity is important, since the drug-in-
duced valvulopathy documented with two other serotonergic agents 
that were removed from the market—fenfluramine and dexfenflu-
ramine—was due to activation of the 5-HT2B receptors expressed 
on  cardiac  valvular  interstitial  cells.  By  activating  the  5-HT2C 
receptor, lorcaserin is thought to decrease food intake through the 
pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) system of neurons.

Lorcaserin  underwent  two  randomized,  placebo-controlled, 
double-blind trials for efficacy and safety. Intention-to-treat 1-year 
placebo-subtracted weight loss was 3.6% and 3.0%, respectively, in 
the  two  pivotal  trials.  Modest  statistical  improvements  consistent 
with the weight loss were seen in selected cardiovascular and met-
abolic  outcome  measurements.  However,  a  postmarketing  cardio-
vascular outcome trial found that more patients taking lorcaserin 
(7.7%)  were  diagnosed  with  cancer  compared  to  those  taking  a 
placebo  (7.1%).  The  trial  was  conducted  in  12,000  patients  over   
5 years. A range of cancer types was reported, with several different 
types of cancers occurring more frequently in the lorcaserin group, 
including pancreatic, colorectal, and lung.

Naltrexone SR/bupropion SR (NB) is a combination of an opioid 
antagonist and a mild reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepi-
nephrine, respectively. Individually, naltrexone is approved by the 
FDA for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the blockade 
of the effects of exogenously administered opioids, whereas bupro-
pion is approved as an antidepressant and smoking cessation aid. As 
a combination drug, each component works in consort: bupropion 
stimulates secretion of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) 
from  POMC,  whereas  naltrexone  blocks  the  feedback  inhibitory 
effects of opioid receptors activated by the β-endorphin released in 
the hypothalamus, thus allowing the inhibitory effects of MSH to 
reduce food intake.

The  medication  has  undergone  three  randomized,  placebo- 
controlled, double-blind trials for efficacy and safety. Participants were 
randomized to receive NB (8 mg/90 mg two tablets bid) or placebo 
in the three COR studies. Whereas participants received standard-
ized  nutritional  and  exercise  counseling  in  COR-I  and  COR-II, 
a  more  intensive  behavior  modification  program  was  provided 
in  COR-BMOD  (Table  402-5).  Intention-to-treat  1-year  placebo-
subtracted  weight  loss  was  4.8%,  5.1%,  and  4.2%,  respectively,  in 
the COR-I, COR-II, and COR-BMOD trials. Clinical and statistical 
dose-dependent  improvements  were  seen  in  selected  cardiovas-
cular  and  metabolic  outcome  measurements  that  were  related  to 
the weight loss. However, the medication led to slight increases or 
smaller  decreases  in  blood  pressure  and  pulse  than  placebo.  The 
most common adverse events experienced by the drug-randomized 
groups  were  nausea,  constipation,  headache,  vomiting,  dizziness, 
diarrhea, insomnia, and dry mouth.

Liraglutide,  the  fourth  new  medication,  is  a  glucagon-like   

peptide-1  (GLP-1)  analogue  with  97%  homology  to  human  GLP-1 
that was previously approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes at 
doses up to 1.8 mg once daily. In addition to its effect as an incretin 
hormone (glucose-induced insulin secretion), liraglutide inhibits both 
gastric emptying and glucagon secretion and stimulates GLP-1 recep-
tors in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to reduce feeding.

Liraglutide  has  undergone 

randomized,  placebo- 
controlled,  double-blind  trials  for  efficacy  and  safety.  Participants 
were  randomized  to  receive  liraglutide  (3.0  mg  SC  daily)  or  pla-
cebo for initial weight loss—SCALE (patients without diabetes) and 
SCALE  Diabetes  (patients  with  diabetes)—or  for  weight  mainte-
nance after initial weight loss (SCALE Maintenance) (Table 402-5). 
All  participants  received  diet  and  exercise  counseling.  For  SCALE 
and  SCALE  Maintenance,  patients  were  overweight  or  obese  and 
had  treated  or  untreated  hypertension  or  dyslipidemia.  Intention-
to-treat  1-year  placebo-subtracted  weight  loss  was  5.4  and  6.1%, 
respectively, in the SCALE and SCALE Maintenance trials. Clinical 
and statistical dose-dependent improvements were seen in selected

cardiovascular  and  metabolic  outcome  measurements;  however, 
there was a small increase in heart rate. The most common adverse 
effects include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting. GLP-1 
agonists should not be prescribed in patients with a family or per-
sonal  history  of  medullary  thyroid  cancer  or  multiple  endocrine 
neoplasia.

In approving the new antiobesity medications, the FDA introduced 
a new provision with important clinical relevance: a prescription trial 
period to assess effectiveness. Response to these medications should 
be assessed after 12 weeks of treatment for PHEN/TPM (or 16 weeks 
for NB and liraglutide since these medications are uptitrated during 
the  first  month).  Determining  responsiveness  at  3  or  4  months  is 
based on the post hoc observed trial data that patients who did not 
lose a prespecified amount of weight early in treatment were less suc-
cessful at 1 year. For PHEN/TPM, if the patient has not lost at least 3% 
of body weight at 3 months, the clinician can either escalate the dose 
and reassess progress at 6 months or discontinue treatment entirely. 
For NB, the medication should be discontinued if the patient has not 
lost at least 5% of body weight. The corresponding responsive target 
for liraglutide is a 4% weight loss. 

Peripherally Acting Medications  Orlistat is a synthetic hydroge-
nated derivative of a naturally occurring lipase inhibitor, lipostatin, 
that  is  produced  by  the  mold  Streptomyces  toxytricini.  This  drug 
is  a  potent,  slowly  reversible  inhibitor  of  pancreatic,  gastric,  and 
carboxylester lipases and phospholipase A2, which are required for 
the hydrolysis of dietary fat into fatty acids and monoacylglycerols. 
Orlistat  acts  in  the  lumen  of  the  stomach  and  small  intestine  by 
forming a covalent bond with the active site of these lipases. Taken 
at a therapeutic dose of 120 mg tid, orlistat blocks the digestion and 
absorption of ~30% of dietary fat. After discontinuation of the drug, 
fecal fat content usually returns to normal within 48–72 h.

Multiple  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  stud-
ies  have  shown  that,  after  1  year,  orlistat  produces  a  weight  loss 

of  ~9–10%,  whereas  placebo  recipients  have  a  4–6%  weight  loss. 
Because  orlistat  is  minimally  (<1%)  absorbed  from  the  gastroin-
testinal tract, it has no systemic side effects. The drug’s tolerability 
is  related  to  the  malabsorption  of  dietary  fat  and  the  subsequent 
passage of fat in the feces. Adverse gastrointestinal effects, including 
flatus with discharge, fecal urgency, fatty/oily stool, and increased 
defecation, are reported in at least 10% of orlistat-treated patients. 
These  side  effects  generally  are  experienced  early,  diminish  as 
patients control their dietary fat intake, and only infrequently cause 
patients  to  withdraw  from  clinical  trials.  When  taken  concomi-
tantly, psyllium mucilloid is helpful in controlling orlistat-induced 
gastrointestinal  side  effects.  Because  serum  concentrations  of  the 
fat-soluble  vitamins  D  and  E  and  β-carotene  may  be  reduced  by 
orlistat treatment, vitamin supplements are recommended to pre-
vent  potential  deficiencies.  Orlistat  was  approved  for  over-the-
counter use in 2007. 

Oral  Device  Gelesis100  is  a  nonsystemic,  water-soluble  gel  that 
was  approved  by  the  FDA  in  2019.  In  the  stomach,  the  capsule 
releases  the  cellulose  microgel,  which  absorbs  water  and  forms 
a  matrix  with  the  consistency  of  food,  occupying  ~25%  of  the 
stomach. In the large intestine, it is broken down by enzymes and 
the  cellulose  is  excreted.  Gelesis100  and  placebo  were  evaluated 
over 24 weeks in patients with BMI of 27 to ≤40 kg/m2 and fasting 
plasma  glucose  of  90–145  mg/dL.  Intention-to-treat,  24-week, 
placebo-subtracted weight loss was 2.1% (6.4 vs 4.4%). Gelesis100 
treatment had no apparent increased safety risks. The capsules are 
approved  for  patients  with  a  BMI  of  ≥25  kg/m2,  with  or  without 
comorbidities. 

SURGERY
Bariatric surgery (Fig. 402-3) can be considered for patients with 
severe obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m2) or for those with moderate obesity 
(BMI ≥35 kg/m2) associated with a number of comorbid conditions.

Weight-loss  surgeries  have  traditionally  been  classified  into  three 
categories on the basis of anatomic changes: restrictive, restrictive 
malabsorptive,  and  malabsorptive.  More  recently,  however,  the 
clinical  benefits  of  bariatric  surgery  in  achieving  weight  loss  and 
alleviating  metabolic  comorbidities  have  been  attributed  largely 
to changes in the physiologic responses of gut hormones, bile acid 
metabolism, the microbiota, and adipose tissue metabolism. Met-
abolic effects resulting from bypassing the foregut include altered 
responses of ghrelin, GLP-1, peptide YY3-36, and oxyntomodulin. 
Additional effects on food intake and body weight control may be 
attributed to changes in vagal signaling. The loss of fat mass, partic-
ularly visceral fat, is associated with multiple metabolic, adipokine, 
and  inflammatory  changes  that  include  improved  insulin  sensi-
tivity  and  glucose  disposal;  reduced  free  fatty  acid  flux;  increased 
adiponectin  levels;  and  decreased  interleukin  6,  tumor  necrosis 
factor α, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.

Restrictive surgeries limit the amount of food the stomach can 
hold and slow the rate of gastric emptying. Laparoscopic adjustable 
gastric banding is the prototype of this category. The first banding 
device, the LAP-BAND, was approved for use in the United States in 
2001. In contrast to previous devices, this band has a diameter that 
is adjustable by way of its connection to a reservoir that is implanted 
under the skin. Injection of saline into the reservoir and removal 
of saline from the reservoir tighten and loosen the band’s internal 
diameter, respectively, thus changing the size of the gastric opening. 
Although the mean percentage of total body weight lost at 5 years 
is estimated at 20–25%, longer-term follow-up has been more dis-
appointing, leading to near abandonment of the procedure. In the 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, the stomach is restricted by stapling 
and dividing it vertically, removing ~80% of the greater curvature 
and leaving a slim banana-shaped remnant stomach along the lesser 
curvature. Weight loss after this procedure is superior to that after 
laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.

The three restrictive-malabsorptive bypass procedures combine 
the  elements  of  gastric  restriction  and  selective  malabsorption: 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, biliopancreatic diversion, and biliopan-
creatic diversion with duodenal switch (Fig. 402-3). Roux-en-Y is 
the  most  commonly  undertaken  and  most  accepted  bypass  pro-
cedure. These procedures are routinely performed by laparoscopy.

These  procedures  generally  produce  a  30–35%  average  total 
body  weight  loss  at  12–18  months  followed  by  variable  weight 
regain  thereafter.  Significant  improvement  in  multiple  obesity- 
related  comorbid  conditions,  including  type  2  diabetes,  hyper-
tension,  dyslipidemia,  obstructive  sleep  apnea,  quality  of  life, 
and  long-term  cardiovascular  events,  has  been  reported.  A  meta- 
analysis  of  controlled  clinical  trials  comparing  bariatric  surgery 
versus  no  surgery  showed  that  surgery  was  associated  with  a 
reduced odds ratio (OR) risk of global mortality (OR = 0.55), car-
diovascular death (OR = 0.58), and all-cause mortality (OR = 0.70).
Among  the  observed  improvements  in  comorbidities,  the  pre-
vention  and  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  resulting  from  bariat-
ric  surgery  have  garnered  the  most  attention.  Fifteen-year  data 
from  the  Swedish  Obese  Subjects  study  demonstrated  a  marked 
reduction  (i.e.,  by  78%)  in  the  incidence  of  type  2  diabetes  devel-
opment  among  obese  patients  who  underwent  bariatric  sur-
gery.  Multiple  randomized  controlled  studies  have  shown  greater 
weight  loss  and  more  improved  glycemic  control  from  1  and   
5 years among surgical patients than among patients receiving con-
ventional  medical  therapy.  A  retrospective  cohort  study  of  >4000 
adults  with  diabetes  found  that,  overall,  68.2%  of  patients  expe-
rienced  an  initial  complete  remission  of  type  2  diabetes  within 
5  years  after  surgery.  However,  among  these  patients,  one-third 
redeveloped  type  2  diabetes  within  5  years.  Patients  with  earlier- 
stage type 2 diabetes (i.e., those who do not need insulin, with shorter-
duration  disease,  and  with  lower  hemoglobin  A1c)  appear  to  have 
better  improvement  after  bariatric  surgery.  The  rapid  improvement 
seen in diabetes after bariatric surgery is thought to be due to caloric 
restriction, reduced insulin resistance, and surgery-specific effects on 
glucose homeostasis brought about by alteration of gut hormones.

The  mortality  rate  from  bariatric  surgery  is  generally  <1% 
but  varies  with  the  procedure,  the  patient’s  age  and  comorbid 
conditions,  and  the  experience  of  the  surgical  team.  The  most 
common  surgical  complications  include  stomal  stenosis  or  mar-
ginal ulcers (occurring in 5–15% of patients) that present as pro-
longed  nausea  and  vomiting  after  eating  or  inability  to  advance 
the diet to solid foods. These complications typically are treated by 
endoscopic balloon dilation and acid suppression therapy, respec-
tively.  For  patients  who  undergo  laparoscopic  adjustable  gastric 
banding,  there  are  no  intestinal  absorptive  abnormalities  other 
than  mechanical  reduction  in  gastric  size  and  outflow.  Therefore, 
selective  deficiencies  are  uncommon  unless  eating  habits  become 
unbalanced.  In  contrast,  the  restrictive-malabsorptive  procedures 
carry  an  increased  risk  for  micronutrient  deficiencies  of  vitamin 
B12, iron, folate, calcium, and vitamin D. Patients with restrictive- 
malabsorptive  procedures  require  lifelong  supplementation  with 
these micronutrients. 
Intraluminal  Gastric  Balloons  Three  gastric  balloon  devices  are 
approved  for  weight  loss  that  are  either  placed  in  the  stomach 
endoscopically (the REHAPE and ORBERA devices) or swallowed 
(OBALON). Efficacy of the devices at 6 months, based on a pooled 
weighted-mean  percent  weight  loss,  was  9.7%,  and  the  control-
subtracted percent weight loss was 5.6%. The devices are approved 
only for up to 6 months of use in adults with a BMI of 30–40 kg/m2.  
Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Diagnosis, Classification,  
and Pathophysiology

Diabetes mellitus (DM) refers to a group of common metabolic disor-
ders that share the phenotype of hyperglycemia. Several distinct types 
of DM are caused by a complex interaction of genetics and environ-
mental factors. Depending on the etiology of the DM, factors contrib-
uting  to  hyperglycemia  include  reduced  insulin  secretion,  decreased 
glucose utilization, and increased glucose production. The metabolic 
dysregulation associated with DM causes secondary pathophysiologic 
changes in multiple organ systems that impose a tremendous burden 
on  the  individual  with  diabetes  and  on  the  health  care  system.  In 
the United States, DM is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease

ness.  Persons  with  diabetes  are  at  increased  risk  for  cardiovascular 
disease,  which  is  the  main  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  this 
population.

CLASSIFICATION
DM  is  classified  on  the  basis  of  the  pathogenic  process  leading  to 
hyperglycemia (Table 403-1). There are two broad categories of DM, 
designated as either type 1 or type 2 DM. However, there is increasing 
recognition of other forms of diabetes in which the molecular patho-
genesis is better understood and may be associated with a single gene 
defect.  These  alternative  forms  as  well  as  other  “atypical”  forms  may 
share features of type 1 and/or type 2 DM. Type 1 DM develops as a 
result of autoimmunity against the insulin-producing beta cells, result-
ing in insulin deficiency. Type 2 DM is a heterogeneous group of dis-
orders characterized by variable degrees of insulin resistance, impaired 
insulin  secretion,  and  increased  hepatic  glucose  production.  Defects 
in insulin action and/or secretion give rise to the common phenotype 
of hyperglycemia in type 2 DM and have important therapeutic impli-
cations now that pharmacologic agents are available to target specific 
metabolic derangements. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are preceded 
by a period of progressive worsening of glucose homeostasis, followed 
by  the  development  of  hyperglycemia  that  exceeds  the  threshold  for 
clinical diagnosis. In terms of type 2 diabetes, this phase is referred to

FIGURE 403-1  Spectrum of glucose homeostasis and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus 
(DM).  Glucose  homeostasis  is  a  spectrum  from  normal  glucose  tolerance  (left 
portion of figure) to diabetes (right portion of figure) including type 1 DM, type 2 DM, 
specific types of diabetes, and gestational DM. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes 
are shown in the lower right portion of the figure and include the hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c),  the  fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG),  and  the  2-h  plasma  glucose  (PG)  after 
a  glucose  challenge.  In  most  types  of  DM,  the  individual  traverses  from  normal 
glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance to overt diabetes (these should be 
viewed not as abrupt categories but as a spectrum). Changes in glucose tolerance 
may be bidirectional in some types of diabetes. For example, individuals with type 
2  DM  may  return  to  the  impaired  glucose  tolerance  category  with  weight  loss;  in 
gestational  DM,  diabetes  may  revert  to  impaired  glucose  tolerance  or  normal 
glucose tolerance after delivery. aRandom is defined as without regard to time since 
the last meal. bFasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h. CHemoglobin A1c 
test should be performed in a laboratory using a method approved by the National 
Glycohemoglobin  Standardization  Program  and  correlated  to  the  reference  assay 
of  the  Diabetes  Control  and  Complications  Trial.  Point-of-care  hemoglobin  A1c 
should  not  be  used  for  diagnostic  purposes.  dThe  test  should  be  performed  using 
a  glucose  load  containing  the  equivalent  of  75  g  anhydrous  glucose  dissolved  in 
water, not recommended for routine clinical use. Assessment of 1-h glucose may 
be helpful in diabetes risk prediction in individuals with cystic fibrosis or other forms 
of  pancreatic  disease.  In  the  absence  of  unequivocal  hyperglycemia  and  acute 
metabolic decompensation, the blood glucose criteria should be confirmed by repeat 
testing on a different day. These values do not apply to the diagnosis of gestational 
DM. *Some use the term increased risk for diabetes or intermediate hyperglycemia 
(World Health Organization) rather than prediabetes. (Data from American Diabetes 
Association. 2. Classification and Diagnosis of Diabetes: Standards of Medical Care 
in Diabetes-2021. Diabetes Care 44:S15, 2021.)

as  prediabetes  and  is  more  specifically  classified  as  impaired  fasting 
glucose  (IFG)  or  impaired  glucose  tolerance  (IGT)  (Fig.  403-1). 
Recently, three distinct stages of type 1 DM have been defined based on 
the development of autoantibodies against pancreatic beta cell antigens 
or the development of worsening dysglycemia (discussed below).

 ■ OTHER TYPES OF DM
Other etiologies of DM include specific genetic defects in insulin secre-
tion or action, metabolic abnormalities that impair insulin secretion, 
mitochondrial  abnormalities,  and  a  host  of  conditions  that  impair 
glucose  tolerance  (Table  403-1).  Maturity-onset  diabetes  of  the  young 
(MODY) and monogenic diabetes are subtypes of DM characterized by 
autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset of hyperglycemia (usually 
<25 years; sometimes in neonatal period), and impaired insulin secre-
tion (discussed below). Mutations in the insulin receptor cause a group 
of rare disorders characterized by severe insulin resistance.

DM may also develop as a result of cystic fibrosis or chronic pancre-
atitis, in which the islets become damaged from a primary pathologic 
process  originating  in  the  pancreatic  exocrine  tissue.  Hormones  that 
antagonize  insulin  action  can  lead  to  DM.  Hyperglycemia  is  often  a 
feature of endocrinopathies such as acromegaly and Cushing’s disease. 
Viral  infections  have  been  implicated  in  pancreatic  islet  destruction 
but are an extremely rare cause of DM. A form of acute onset of type 1 
diabetes, termed fulminant diabetes, has been noted in Japan and may 
be related to viral infection of the islets.

 ■ GESTATIONAL DM
Glucose intolerance developing during the second or third trimester of 
pregnancy is classified as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Insulin 
resistance  is  related  to  the  metabolic  changes  of  pregnancy,  during 
which  the  increased  insulin  demands  may  lead  to  IGT  or  diabetes. 
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that diabetes 
diagnosed within the first trimester be classified as preexisting preges-
tational diabetes rather than GDM. In 2019, the International Diabetes 
Federation  (IDF)  estimated  that  16%  of  pregnancies  worldwide  were 
affected by either GDM or preexisting DM. Most women with GDM 
revert to normal glucose tolerance postpartum but have a substantial 
risk (35–60%) of developing DM in the next 10–20 years. In addition, 
children  born  to  a  mother  with  GDM  also  have  an  increased  risk  of 
developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 DM later in life. Currently, 
the  ADA  recommends  that  women  with  a  history  of  GDM  undergo 
lifelong  screening  for  the  development  of  diabetes  or  prediabetes  at 
least every 3 years.
 ■ ATYPICAL DIABETES
It is increasingly recognized that some forms of diabetes have features 
of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These are distinct from monogenic 
forms  (MODY)  as  they  have  not  been  linked  to  single  gene  defects. 
The development of a type 2 diabetes phenotype before puberty and 
a type 2 diabetes phenotype in very lean individuals are examples of 
atypical  diabetes.  An  additional  example  is  ketosis-prone  diabetes, 
where individuals present with ketoacidosis, but do not require long-
term exogenous insulin therapy. Many of these individuals are African 
American or Asian in heritage. Mechanisms underlying atypical forms 
of diabetes are being actively studied.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
The  worldwide  prevalence  of  DM  has  risen  dramatically  over  the  past 
two decades, from an estimated 30 million cases in 1985 to 463 million in 
2019 (Fig. 403-2). Based on current trends, the IDF projects that 642 mil-
lion individuals will have diabetes by the year 2040 (see http://www.idf.
org/). Although the prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 DM is increasing 
worldwide,  the  prevalence  of  type  2  DM  is  rising  much  more  rapidly, 
presumably because of dietary changes and increasing obesity, reduced 
activity  levels  as  countries  become  more  industrialized,  and  aging  of 
the  population.  The  incidence  of  type  1  diabetes  has  been  increasing 
at  a  rate  of  3%  per  year  worldwide,  with  clear  geographic  differences. 
The  cause  for  this  increase  is  not  well  understood,  but  type  1  DM  is 
increasingly being diagnosed at younger ages. In 2019, the prevalence of 
diabetes in individuals aged 20–79 years worldwide was 9.3%, ranging 
from 4.7–12.2%. The countries with the greatest number of individuals 
with diabetes in 2019 were China (116.4 million), India (77 million), the 
United States (31 million), Pakistan (19.4 million), Brazil (16.8 million), 
and  Mexico  (12.8  million).  In  the  most 
recent  estimate  for  the  United  States 
(2020),  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control 
and  Prevention  (CDC)  estimated  that 
10.5%  of  the  population  had  diabetes. 
Diabetes  affected  13%  of  all  U.S.  adults, 
and  as  many  as  34%  or  88  million  U.S. 
adults  had  prediabetes.  Approximately 
21.4% of U.S. adults with diabetes in the 
United States were undiagnosed; globally, 
it  is  estimated  that  as  many  as  50%  of 
individuals with diabetes may be undiag-
nosed.  The  prevalence  of  DM  increases 
with  age.  The  prevalence  of  DM  in  the 
United States was estimated to be 0.25% 
in  individuals  age  <20  years,  4.2%  in 
persons aged 18–44 years, and 17.5% in 
persons  45–64  years  old.  In  individuals 
aged  >65  years,  the  prevalence  of  DM 
was  26.8%.  Similar  age-related  trends 
have been observed worldwide.

There is considerable geographic variation in the incidence of both 
type 1 and type 2 DM. Currently, Scandinavia, followed by Sardina and 
Portugal, have the highest incidence of type 1 DM; the lowest incidence 
is in the Pacific Rim where it is twenty- to thirtyfold lower. Northern 
Europe and the United States have an intermediate rate. Much of the 
increased risk of type 1 DM is believed to reflect the frequency of high-
risk  human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  alleles  among  ethnic  groups  in 
different geographic locations. However, now populations less enriched 
with  these  classic  high-risk  HLA  alleles  are  experiencing  more  rapid 
increases in type 1 DM incidence, suggesting an influence of environ-
mental factors.

The prevalence of type 2 DM and its harbinger, IGT, is highest in 
certain Pacific islands and the Middle East and intermediate in coun-
tries such as India and the United States. This variability is likely due 
to genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. DM prevalence also 
varies among different ethnic populations within a given country, with 
indigenous populations usually having a greater incidence of diabetes 
than the general population of the country. For example, the CDC esti-
mated that the age-adjusted prevalence of DM in the United States (age 
>20 years; 2017–2018) was 7.5% in non-Hispanic whites, 9.2% in Asian 
Americans, 12.5% in Hispanics, and 11.7% in non-Hispanic blacks, but 
it  exceeds  14%  in  American-Indian  and  Alaskan  native  populations. 
The onset of type 2 DM occurs, on average, at an earlier age in ethnic 
groups  other  than  non-Hispanic  whites.  In  Asia,  the  prevalence  of 
diabetes is increasing rapidly, with an onset at a lower body mass index 
(BMI) and younger age, greater visceral adiposity, and reduced insulin 
secretory capacity.

Diabetes is a major cause of mortality. In recent years, diabetes has 
been listed as the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, 
but  several  studies  indicate  that  diabetes-related  deaths  are  likely 
underreported. In 2019, data from the IDF suggest that diabetes was 
responsible  for  nearly  4.2  million  deaths  worldwide,  accounting  for 
11.3% of global all-cause mortality in adults aged 20–79 years. Diabetes 
also  has  important  economic  implications.  In  2019,  it  was  estimated 
that  $760  billion  of  health  care  expenditures  worldwide  were  spent 
on  diabetes  (a  range  of  8–19%  of  total  expenditures  across  regions). 
Up to 75% of individuals with diabetes live in low- or middle-income 
countries.

DIAGNOSIS
Glucose tolerance is classified into three broad categories: normal glu-
cose homeostasis, impaired glucose homeostasis, or DM (Fig. 403-1). 
Glucose  tolerance  can  be  assessed  using  the  fasting  plasma  glucose 
(FPG),  the  response  to  oral  glucose  challenge,  or  the  hemoglobin 
A1c  (HbA1c).  An  FPG  <5.6  mmol/L  (100  mg/dL),  a  plasma  glucose 
<7.9  mmol/L  (140  mg/dL)  following  an  oral  glucose  challenge,  and 
an  HbA1c  <5.7%  are  considered  to  define  normal  glucose  tolerance.

in Adults
1.  Consider testing in overweight or obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m2, ≥23 kg/m2 in Asian 

Americans, or other ethnically relevant definition who have these risk factors:
•	 Family history of diabetes (i.e., parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes)
•	 Race/ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian 

American, Pacific Islander)

•	 Hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg)
•	 HDL cholesterol level <35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level 

>250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L)

•	 Polycystic ovary syndrome or acanthosis nigricans
•	 History of cardiovascular disease
•	 Physical inactivity
•	 Other condition associated with insulin resistance (severe obesity, 

acanthosis nigricans)

2.  Individuals with previously identified IFG, IGT, or a hemoglobin A1c of 5.7–6.4% 

should be screened annually.

3.  Women who had GDM should be screened at least every 3 years.
4.  For other individuals, initiate testing at 45 years of age and repeat every  

3 years.

5.  Individuals with HIV

the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the 
IDF have issued diagnostic criteria for DM (Table 403-2) based on the 
following premises: (1) the FPG, the response to an oral glucose chal-
lenge  (oral  glucose  tolerance  test  [OGTT]),  and  HbA1c  differ  among 
individuals,  and  (2)  DM  is  defined  as  the  level  of  glycemia  at  which 
diabetes-specific  complications  occur  rather  than  deviation  from  a 
population-based mean. For example, the prevalence of retinopathy in 
Native  Americans  (Pima  Indian  population)  begins  to  increase  at  an 
FPG >6.4 mmol/L (116 mg/dL) (Fig. 403-3).

Abnormal glucose homeostasis can be diagnosed by three distinct 
criteria (Fig. 403-1). First, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as 
a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L (100–125 mg/
dL).  Second,  impaired  glucose  tolerance  (IGT)  is  defined  as  a  plasma

glucose  level  of  7.8–11  mmol/L  (140–199  mg/dL)  following  an  oral 
glucose  challenge.  Third,  an  HbA1c  of  5.7–6.4%  reflects  dysglycemia 
by  all  mechanisms.  While  an  HbA1c  of  5.7–6.4%,  IFG,  and  IGT  do 
not identify the same individuals (i.e., different biologic mechanisms 
involved), individuals in all three groups are at greater risk of progress-
ing to type 2 DM, have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and 
should  be  counseled  about  ways  to  decrease  these  risks  (see  below). 
Some use the terms prediabetes, increased risk of diabetes, or interme-
diate hyperglycemia (World Health Organization) and slightly different 
metrics for this category.

It  is  important  to  recognize  that  these  values  for  the  FPG,  the 
glucose  following  an  oral  glucose  challenge,  and  HbA1c  are  contin-
uous  rather  than  discrete  variables;  risk  for  comorbidities  increases 
continuously  rather  than  discretely  by  diagnostic  category.  A  FPG  
≥7.0  mmol/L  (126  mg/dL),  a  glucose  ≥11.1  mmol/L  (200  mg/dL)  
2 h after an oral glucose challenge, or an HbA1c ≥6.5% meets the cri-
teria for the diagnosis of DM (Fig. 403-1). A random plasma glucose 
concentration  ≥11.1  mmol/L  (200  mg/dL)  accompanied  by  classic 
symptoms of DM (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss) is also sufficient 
for the diagnosis of DM. The current criteria for the diagnosis of DM 
emphasize the HbA1c and the FPG as the most reliable and convenient 
tests for identifying DM in asymptomatic individuals. However, some 
individuals may meet criteria for one test but not the other. Also, it is 
important to note that race and ethnicity may impact the reliability of 
HbA1c  levels.  For  example,  African  Americans  have  a  higher  HbA1c 
value compared to non-Hispanic whites with a similar level of glyce-
mia. An OGTT, although a valid means for diagnosing DM, is not often 
used in routine clinical care with the exception of pregnancy care and 
screening for gestational diabetes.

The  diagnosis  of  DM  has  profound  implications  for  an  individual 
from both a medical and a financial standpoint. Thus, abnormalities 
on  screening  tests  for  diabetes  should  be  repeated  before  making  a 
definitive diagnosis of DM, unless acute metabolic derangements or a 
markedly elevated plasma glucose are present. These criteria also allow 
for the diagnosis of DM to be withdrawn in situations when the glucose 
intolerance reverts to normal.

 ■ SCREENING
Widespread use of the FPG or the HbA1c as a screening test for type 2 
DM is recommended because (1) a large number of individuals who 
meet the current criteria for DM are asymptomatic and unaware that 
they  have  the  disorder,  (2)  epidemiologic  studies  suggest  that  type 
2  DM  may  be  present  for  up  to  a  decade  before  diagnosis,  (3)  some 
individuals with type 2 DM have one or more diabetes-specific compli-
cations at the time of their diagnosis, (4) treatment of type 2 DM may 
favorably alter the natural history of DM, and (5) diagnosis of prediabe-
tes should spur efforts for diabetes prevention. The ADA recommends 
screening  all  individuals  aged  >45  years  every  3  years  and  screening 
individuals at an earlier age if they are overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2 or 
ethnically relevant definition for overweight) and have one additional 
risk factor for diabetes. Although a number of immunologic markers 
for type 1 DM are becoming available (discussed below), their routine 
use  outside  a  clinical  trial  is  discouraged,  pending  the  identification 
of  clinically  beneficial  interventions  for  individuals  at  high  risk  for 
developing type 1 DM.

REGULATION OF GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS
 ■ OVERALL REGULATION OF  
GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS
Glucose  homeostasis  reflects  a  balance  between  energy  intake  from 
ingested  food,  hepatic  glucose  production  (gluconeogenesis),  and 
peripheral  tissue  glucose  uptake  and  utilization.  Insulin  is  the  most 
important  regulator  of  this  metabolic  equilibrium,  but  neural  input, 
metabolic  signals,  and  other  hormones  (e.g.,  glucagon)  result  in 
integrated control of glucose supply and utilization (Fig. 403-4). The 
organs  that  regulate  glucose  and  lipids  communicate  by  neural  and 
humoral  mechanisms  with  fat  and  muscle  producing  adipokines, 
myokines, and metabolites that influence liver function. In the fasting

state,  low  insulin  levels,  together  with  modest  increases  in  glucagon, 
increase  glucose  production  by  promoting  hepatic  gluconeogenesis 
and glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis). In parallel, glucose uptake 
in  insulin-sensitive  tissues  (skeletal  muscle  and  fat)  is  reduced,  and 
there  is  increased  mobilization  of  gluconeogenic  precursors  such  as 
amino acids and free fatty acids (lipolysis). Under normal conditions 
alpha  cells  increase  glucagon  secretion  only  when  blood  glucose  or 
insulin levels are low or during exercise, but it is increased in fasting 
and  postprandially  in  DM  and  stimulates  excess  glycogenolysis  and 
gluconeogenesis by the liver and to a small degree by the renal medulla 
(Chap.  406).  Conversely,  in  healthy  people,  the  postprandial  glucose 
load elicits a rise in insulin and fall in glucagon, leading to optimized 
glucose disposal. Insulin, an anabolic hormone, promotes the storage 
of  carbohydrate  and  fat  and  protein  synthesis.  The  major  portion  of 
postprandial glucose is utilized by skeletal muscle, an effect of insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake. Other tissues, most notably the brain, utilize 
glucose in an insulin-independent fashion. Factors secreted by skeletal 
myocytes, adipocytes (e.g., leptin, resistin, adiponectin), and bone also 
influence glucose homeostasis.
 ■ INSULIN BIOSYNTHESIS
Insulin,  produced  by  the  beta  cells  of  the  pancreatic  islets,  is  ini-
tially synthesized as a single-chain 86-amino-acid precursor polypep-
tide,  preproinsulin.  Subsequent  proteolytic  processing  removes  the 
amino-terminal signal peptide, giving rise to proinsulin. Proinsulin is 
structurally related to insulin-like growth factors I and II, which bind 
weakly to the insulin receptor. Cleavage of an internal 31-residue frag-
ment from proinsulin generates C-peptide with the A (21 amino acids) 
and B (30 amino acids) chains of insulin being connected by disulfide 
bonds. The mature insulin molecule and C-peptide are stored together 
and  co-secreted  from  secretory  granules  in  the  beta  cells.  Because 
C-peptide is cleared more slowly than insulin, it is a useful marker of 
insulin secretion and allows discrimination of endogenous and exoge-
nous sources of insulin in the evaluation of hypoglycemia (Chaps. 406 
and  84).  Elevated  levels  of  serum  proinsulin  have  been  observed  in 
both  type  1  and  2  DM  and  are  thought  to  be  indicative  of  beta  cell 
dysfunction. Pancreatic beta cells co-secrete islet amyloid polypeptide 
(IAPP)  or  amylin,  a  37-amino-acid  peptide,  along  with  insulin.  The 
role of IAPP in normal physiology is incompletely defined, but it is the 
major component of the amyloid fibrils found in the islets of patients 
with  type  2  diabetes,  and  an  analogue  is  sometimes  used  in  treating 
type 1 and type 2 DM (Chap. 404).
 ■ INSULIN SECRETION
Glucose is the key regulator of insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta 
cell,  although  amino  acids,  ketones,  various  nutrients,  gastrointesti-
nal  peptides,  and  neurotransmitters  also  influence  insulin  secretion. 
Glucose  levels  >3.9  mmol/L  (70  mg/dL)  stimulate  insulin  synthesis,

FIGURE  403-5  Mechanisms  of  glucose-stimulated 
insulin  secretion  and 
abnormalities in diabetes. Glucose and other nutrients regulate insulin secretion 
by the pancreatic beta cell. Glucose is transported by a glucose transporter (GLUT1 
and/or GLUT2 in humans, GLUT2 in rodents); subsequent glucose metabolism by the 
beta cell alters ion channel activity, leading to insulin secretion. The SUR receptor 
is the binding site for some drugs that act as insulin secretagogues. Mutations in

primarily  by  enhancing  protein  translation  and  processing.  Glucose 
stimulation  of  insulin  secretion  begins  with  its  transport  into  the 
beta  cell  by  a  facilitative  glucose  transporter  (Fig.  403-5).  Glucose 
phosphorylation by glucokinase is the rate-limiting step that controls 
glucose-regulated insulin secretion. Further metabolism of glucose-6-
phosphate via glycolysis generates ATP, which inhibits the activity of 
an  ATP-sensitive  K+  channel.  This  channel  consists  of  two  separate 
proteins:  one  is  the  binding  site  for  certain  oral  hypoglycemics  (e.g., 
sulfonylureas,  meglitinides);  the  other  is  an  inwardly  rectifying  K+ 
channel  protein  (Kir6.2).  Inhibition  of  this  K+  channel  induces  beta 
cell  membrane  depolarization,  which  opens  voltage-dependent  cal-
cium channels (leading to an influx of calcium) and stimulates insulin 
secretion.  Insulin  secretion  occurs  in  two  phases,  a  rapid  first-phase 
response,  and  a  more  prolonged  second  phase.  Impaired  first-phase 
insulin  responses  are  among  the  earliest  detectable  abnormalities 
during the progression of both T1DM and T2DM. A number of meta-
bolic pathways internal to the beta cell as well as external cues amplify 
glucose-stimulated  insulin  secretion.  Glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-
1)  and  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  peptide  (GIP)  are  incretin 
hormones  that  bind  specific  receptors  on  the  beta  cell  to  stimulate 
insulin secretion through cyclic AMP production, but they have this 
effect only when the blood glucose is above the fasting level. Incretin 
hormones  also  suppress  glucagon  production  and  secretion.  Incretin 
analogues or pharmacologic agents that prolong the activity of endoge-
nous GLP-1 are used to treat type 2 DM. Classically, GLP-1 release was 
thought to occur solely from neuroendocrine L-cells of the gastrointes-
tinal tract following food ingestion. However, recent preclinical studies 
suggest that intraislet production of GLP-1 from alpha cells may play a 
role in the regulation of insulin secretion.
 ■ INSULIN ACTION
Insulin is secreted into the portal venous system and acts to suppress 
endogenous hepatic glucose production and increase hepatic glucose 
uptake. A large portion (50%) of secreted insulin is cleared by the liver 
in this first pass, yielding a portal to peripheral insulin concentration 
gradient  of  ~2:1,  with  important  implications  for  the  clinical  use  of 
exogenous insulin (Ch. 404). Uncleared insulin enters the systemic cir-
culation where it binds to receptors in peripheral target tissues such as 
skeletal muscle and adipose. Insulin binding to its receptor stimulates

intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, leading to receptor autophosphoryla-
tion and the recruitment of intracellular signaling molecules, including 
the important insulin receptor substrates (IRS). IRS and other adaptor 
proteins  initiate  a  complex  cascade  of  phosphorylation  and  dephos-
phorylation  reactions,  resulting  in  the  widespread  metabolic  and 
mitogenic effects of insulin. As an example, activation of the phosphat-
idylinositol-3′-kinase  (PI-3-kinase)  pathway  stimulates  translocation 
of  a  facilitative  glucose  transporter  (e.g.,  GLUT4)  to  the  cell  surface, 
an event that is crucial for glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat. 
Activation of other insulin receptor signaling pathways induces glyco-
gen synthesis, protein synthesis, lipogenesis, and regulation of various 
genes in insulin-responsive cells.

beta cells exist but are insufficient in number and quality to maintain 
glucose tolerance. The events that trigger the transition from glucose 
intolerance to frank diabetes are often associated with increased insulin 
requirements, as might occur during infections or at puberty. After the 
initial clinical presentation of type 1 DM, a “honeymoon” phase may 
ensue  during  which  time  glycemic  control  is  achieved  with  modest 
doses of insulin or, rarely, insulin is not needed. However, this fleeting 
phase of endogenous insulin production from residual beta cells disap-
pears and the individual becomes insulin deficient. Many individuals 
with long-standing type 1 DM produce a small amount of insulin (as 
reflected by C-peptide production), and autopsy studies show that beta 
cells can persist in the pancreas decades after diagnosis.

PATHOGENESIS
 ■ TYPE 1 DM
Type  1  DM  is  the  result  of  interactions  of  genetic,  environmental, 
and  immunologic  factors  that  ultimately  lead  to  immune-mediated 
destruction of the pancreatic beta cells and insulin deficiency. Type 1 
DM can develop at any age. Most, but not all, individuals with type 1 
DM have evidence of islet-directed autoimmunity, which is detected by 
the presence of autoantibodies against beta cell antigens in the blood. 
The  presence  of  two  or  more  autoantibodies  is  now  designated  as 
stage 1 T1DM (Fig. 403-6). The temporal decline of beta cell function 
and  mass  preceding  the  development  of  type  1  DM  is  shown  sche-
matically  in  Fig.  403-6.  In  susceptible  individuals,  the  autoimmune 
process  is  thought  to  be  triggered  by  an  infectious  or  environmental 
stimulus.  In  the  majority  of  patients,  autoantibodies  against  beta  cell 
antigens  appear  after  this  triggering  event,  followed  by  progressive 
loss of insulin secretion. The rate of decline in beta cell function varies 
widely  among  individuals,  with  some  patients  progressing  rapidly  to 
clinical diabetes and others evolving to diabetes more slowly and over 
a period of several years. Features of diabetes do not become evident 
until  a  threshold  loss  of  insulin  secretion  and  beta  cell  mass  occurs. 
Autopsy studies suggest the degree of loss of beta cell mass is variable 
at the time of disease presentation. At this point, residual, functional

with a genetic predisposition are exposed to a trigger that initiates an autoimmune 
process, resulting in the development of islet autoantibodies and a gradual decline 
in beta cell function and mass. Stage 1 disease is characterized by the development 
of  two  or  more  islet  cell  autoantibodies  but  the  maintenance  of  normoglycemia. 
Stage  2  disease  is  defined  by  continued  autoimmunity  and  the  development 
of  dysglycemia.  Stage  3  is  defined  by  the  development  of  hyperglycemia  that 
exceeds the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes. The downward slope 
of  the  beta  cell  function  varies  among  individuals  and  may  not  be  continuous.  A 
“honeymoon” phase may be seen in the first 1 or 2 years after the onset of diabetes 
and  is  associated  with  reduced  insulin  requirements.  (Modified  with  permission

 ■ GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS

Susceptibility to type 1 DM involves multiple genes. The concor-
dance of type 1 DM in identical twins ranges from 30–70%, indi-
cating  that  additional  modifying  factors  are  likely  involved  in 
determining whether diabetes develops. The major susceptibility gene 
for type 1 DM is located in the HLA region on chromosome 6. Poly-
morphisms in the HLA complex account for approximately 50% of the 
genetic risk of developing type 1 DM. This region contains genes that 
encode  the  class  II  major  histocompatibility  complex  (MHC)  mole-
cules, which present antigen to helper T cells and thus are involved in 
initiating  the  immune  response  (Chap.  349).  The  ability  of  class  II 
MHC  molecules  to  present  antigen  is  dependent  on  the  amino  acid 
composition  of  their  antigen-binding  sites.  Amino  acid  substitutions 
may influence the specificity of the immune response by altering the 
binding affinity of different antigens for class II molecules.

Many individuals with type 1 DM have the HLA DR3 and/or DR4 
haplotype.  Refinements  in  genotyping  of  HLA  loci  have  shown  that 
the  haplotypes  DQA1*0301,  DQB1*0302,  and  DQB1*0201  are  most 
strongly associated with type 1 DM. These haplotypes are present in 
40% of children with type 1 DM as compared to 2% of the U.S. popula-
tion without type 1 DM. However, most individuals with predisposing 
haplotypes do not develop diabetes.

In  addition  to  MHC  class  II  associations,  genome-wide  associa-
tion studies have identified more than 60 additional genetic loci that 
contribute  susceptibility  to  type  1  DM  (i.e.,  polymorphisms  in  the 
promoter  region  of  the  insulin  gene,  the  CTLA-4  gene,  interleukin 
2  receptor,  and  PTPN22,  etc.).  Combined  assessment  of  HLA  and 
non-HLA  loci  using  genetic  risk  scores  has  been  used  to  improve 
prediction  of  type  1  diabetes  risk.  Notably,  among  recent  cohorts  of 
individuals with new-onset type 1 diabetes, there is a decreased repre-
sentation of the highest-risk HLA alleles and increasing penetrance of 
disease in genotypes classically associated with lower risk, suggesting 
environmental  factors  may  have  an  increasing  role  in  disease  patho-
genesis. Genes that confer protection against the development of the 
disease also exist. The haplotype DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602 is extremely 
rare in individuals with type 1 DM (<1%) and appears to provide pro-
tection from type 1 DM.

Although the risk of developing type 1 DM is increased in relatives 
of individuals with the disease, the risk is relatively low: 1–9% if the 
parent has type 1 DM and 6–7% in a sibling (depending on which HLA 
haplotypes are shared). Hence, the majority of individuals with type 1 
DM (>90%) do not have a relative with this disorder.

Pathophysiology  Pathologically, the pancreatic islets demonstrate 
a  modest  infiltration  of  lymphocytes  (a  process  termed  insulitis); 
however, the frequency of insulitis is heterogeneous both within and 
between  individuals.  Studies  of  the  autoimmune  process  have  iden-
tified the following abnormalities in the innate and adaptive arms of 
the immune system: (1) islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs); (2) activated 
lymphocytes in the islets, and peripancreatic lymph nodes; (3) T lym-
phocytes that proliferate when stimulated with islet proteins; and (4) 
release of cytokines within the insulitis. Islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) 
are  a  composite  of  several  different  antibodies  directed  at  pancreatic 
islet  molecules  such  as  GAD,  insulin,  IA-2/ICA-512,  and  ZnT-8,  and 
serve as a marker of the autoimmune process of type 1 DM. Testing for 
ICAs can be useful in classifying the type of DM as type 1 as they are

3100 present in the majority of individuals (>85%) diagnosed with new-on-
set type 1 DM. ICAs can also identify nondiabetic individuals at risk 
for developing type 1 DM, although their use for this purpose has been 
restricted mostly to research studies. In children with high genetic risk 
followed as part of several birth cohort studies, the presence of two or 
more ICAs was associated with a nearly 70% risk of developing type 1 
DM after 10 years of follow-up and an 80% risk of developing diabetes 
after 15 years of follow-up. These observations led to a revision in the 
staging system for type 1 DM (Fig. 403-5), in which the development 
of multiple autoantibodies is now defined as the onset of stage 1 type 
1 DM. While ICAs can be detected in the serum, and their presence is 
an important biomarker of type 1 diabetes risk, the antibodies do not 
have a direct role in beta cell death. Beta cell destruction is mediated 
by direct CD8+ T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Beta cells may exacerbate 
this process through the development of modified proteins or “neoan-
tigens” and through increased presentation of these antigens on their 
cell  surface  via  upregulation  of  MHC  class  I  molecules.  In  addition, 
beta cells may be damaged by the toxic effects of cytokines (i.e., tumor 
necrosis  factor  α  [TNF-α],  interferon  γ,  and  interleukin  1  [IL-1])  as 
well as reactive oxygen species generated by infiltrating immune cells. 
Efforts to suppress the autoimmune process at the time of diagnosis of 
diabetes have largely been ineffective or only temporarily effective in 
slowing beta cell destruction. Thus, increased emphasis has now been 
placed  on  intervening  earlier  in  the  disease  course  (i.e.,  during  stage 
1 and 2 disease; Fig. 403-6). In support of this notion, a single 14-day 
course of teplizumab, an Fc receptor-nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclo-
nal antibody, delayed the onset of stage 3 T1D in high-risk individuals 
with multiple autoantibodies and dysglycemia (i.e., stage 2 T1D) by a 
median of 2.7 years.

Although  other  islet  cell  types  (alpha  cells  [glucagon-producing], 
delta cells [somatostatin-producing], or PP cells [pancreatic polypep-
tide-producing]) are functionally and embryologically similar to beta 
cells,  they  are  spared  from  the  autoimmune  destruction.  However, 
altered  patterns  of  hormone  secretion  from  these  other  cell  types  in 
type  1  DM  likely  contribute  to  metabolic  instability.  Alpha  cell  dys-
function is reflected by fasting and post-prandial hyperglucagonemia 
but an impaired glucagon response to hypoglycemia.

Environmental  Factors  Numerous  environmental  events  have 
been  proposed  to  trigger  the  autoimmune  process  in  genetically 
susceptible  individuals;  however,  none  has  been  conclusively  linked 
to diabetes. Identification of an environmental trigger has been diffi-
cult because the event may precede the onset of DM by several years  
(Fig.  403-6).  Putative  environmental  triggers  include  viruses  (cox-
sackie, rubella, enteroviruses most prominently), bovine milk proteins, 
nitrosourea compounds, vitamin D deficiency, and environmental tox-
ins. There is increasing interest in the microbiome and type 1 diabetes 
(Chap. 471).

 ■ TYPE 2 DM
Insulin  resistance  and  abnormal  insulin  secretion  are  central  to  the 
development of type 2 DM. Although the primary defect is controver-
sial, most studies support the view that insulin resistance precedes an 
insulin  secretory  defect  but  that  diabetes  develops  only  when  insulin 
secretion becomes inadequate. Type 2 DM likely encompasses a range 
of  disorders  with  the  common  phenotype  of  hyperglycemia.  Histori-
cally, our understanding of the pathophysiology and genetics is based 
on studies of individuals of European descent. Studies in more diverse 
populations have yielded unique insights into pathophysiologic differ-
ences  among  ethnic  groups.  In  general,  Latinos  have  greater  insulin 
resistance and East Asians and South Asians have more beta cell dys-
function,  but  both  defects  are  present  in  both  populations.  East  and 
South Asians appear to develop type 2 DM at a younger age and a lower 
BMI. In some groups, DM that is ketosis prone (often in obese individ-
uals) or ketosis-resistant (often lean) is sometimes seen. For example, 
African  Americans  can  be  more  prone  to  nonketotic  hyperosmolar 
presentation of diabetes exacerbations. In many forms of type 2 DM, the 
social determinants of health play a major role in the rates of type 2 DM.

 ■ GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS

Type 2 DM has a strong genetic component. The concordance of 
type 2 DM in identical twins is between 70% and 90%. Individuals 
with a parent with type 2 DM have an increased risk of diabetes; 
if both parents have type 2 DM, the risk approaches 70%. Insulin resis-
tance, as demonstrated by reduced glucose utilization in skeletal mus-
cle, is present in many nondiabetic, first-degree relatives of individuals 
with type 2 DM. The disease is polygenic and multifactorial, because in 
addition to genetic susceptibility, environmental factors (such as obe-
sity, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity) modulate the phenotype. 
Shared environmental and lifestyle factors also contribute to the high 
concordance in families. Further, the in utero environment contributes 
to, and either increased or reduced birth weight increases the risk of 
type 2 DM in adult life. Children of pregnancies complicated by gesta-
tional hyperglycemia also exhibit an increased risk of type 2 DM.

The genes that predispose to type 2 DM are incompletely identified, 
but genome-wide association studies have identified a large number of 
genes that convey a relatively small risk for type 2 DM (several hundred 
genes each with a relative risk of 1.06–1.5). Most prominent is a variant 
of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene that has been associated with 
both  type  2  DM  and  IGT  in  several  populations.  Genetic  polymor-
phisms associated with type 2 DM have also been found in the genes 
encoding the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ, inward rec-
tifying potassium channel, zinc transporter, IRS, and calpain 10. The 
mechanisms by which these genetic loci increase the susceptibility to 
type 2 DM are not clear, but most are predicted to alter islet function or 
development or insulin secretion. Although the genetic susceptibility 
to type 2 DM is under active investigation (it is estimated that <10% of 
genetic risk is determined by loci identified thus far), it is currently not 
possible to use a combination of known genetic loci to reliably predict 
type 2 DM.

Pathophysiology  Type 2 DM is characterized by impaired insulin 
secretion,  insulin  resistance,  excessive  hepatic  glucose  production, 
abnormal  fat  metabolism,  and  systemic  low-grade  inflammation. 
Obesity,  particularly  visceral  or  central  (as  evidenced  by  the  hip-
waist  ratio),  is  very  common  in  type  2  DM  (≥80%  of  patients  are 
obese).  In  the  early  stages  of  the  disorder,  glucose  tolerance  remains 
near-normal,  despite  insulin  resistance,  because  the  pancreatic  beta 
cells compensate by increasing insulin output (Fig. 403-7). A number

of  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  contribute  to  type  2  DM  and  their 
relative  importance  varies  from  individual  to  individual.  As  insulin 
resistance  and  compensatory  hyperinsulinemia  progress,  the  pancre-
atic  islets  in  certain  individuals  are  unable  to  sustain  the  hyperinsu-
linemic state, manifesting as IGT, defined as elevations in postprandial 
glucose.  A  decline  in  insulin  secretion  and/or  increased  glucagon 
secretion causes an increase in hepatic glucose production leading to 
fasting  hyperglycemia.  Ultimately,  frank  beta  cell  failure  ensues  as  a 
combination of these mechanisms leading to the manifestation of type 
2 diabetes.

Metabolic Abnormalities 
Insulin resistance, the decreased ability 
of  insulin  to  act  effectively  on  target  tissues  (especially  muscle,  liver, 
and fat), is a prominent feature of type 2 DM and results from a com-
bination of genetic susceptibility, obesity, and metabolic inflammation. 
Insulin  resistance  is  relative,  however,  because  supranormal  levels  of 
circulating  insulin  will  normalize  the  plasma  glucose.  In  type  2  DM, 
both  insulin  potency  and  efficacy  are  reduced  leading  to  an  overall 
decrease in glucose utilization under many conditions (30–60% lower 
than in normal individuals). Insulin resistance impairs glucose utiliza-
tion by insulin-sensitive tissues (skeletal muscle) and in liver, coupled 
with  elevated  glucagon,  leads  to  increased  hepatic  glucose  output. 
Increased hepatic glucose output predominantly accounts for increased 
FPG levels, whereas decreased peripheral glucose utilization results in 
postprandial hyperglycemia.

The precise molecular mechanism leading to insulin resistance in 
type 2 DM has not been elucidated. Insulin receptor levels and tyrosine 
kinase activity in skeletal muscle are reduced, but these alterations are 
most  likely  secondary  to  hyperinsulinemia  and  are  not  a  primary 
defect.  Therefore,  “postreceptor”  defects  in  insulin-regulated  phos-
phorylation/dephosphorylation appear to play the predominant role 
in insulin resistance. Abnormalities include the accumulation of lipid 
intermediates within skeletal myocytes, which may impair mitochon-
drial oxidative phosphorylation and reduce insulin-stimulated mito-
chondrial  ATP  production.  Impaired  fatty  acid  oxidation  and  lipid 
accumulation  within  skeletal  myocytes  also  may  generate  reactive 
oxygen species such as lipid peroxides. These and other mechanisms 
also generate low-grade metabolic inflammation that feeds back and 
directly  worsens  insulin  resistance.  Of  note,  not  all  insulin  signal 
transduction  pathways  are  resistant  to  the  effects  of  insulin  (e.g., 
those controlling cell growth and differentiation using the mitogenic- 
activated  protein  kinase  pathway).  Consequently,  hyperin-
sulinemia  may  increase  the  insulin  action  through  these  path-
ways,  potentially  accelerating  diabetes-related  conditions  such  as  
atherosclerosis.

The  obesity  accompanying  type  2  DM,  particularly  in  a  central 
or  visceral  location,  is  thought  to  be  part  of  the  pathogenic  process  
(Chap. 401). In addition to these white fat depots, humans have brown 
fat, which has much greater thermogenic capacity. Efforts are under-
way  to  increase  the  activity  or  quantity  of  brown  fat.  The  increased 
adipocyte mass leads to increased levels of circulating free fatty acids 
and other fat cell products. For example, adipocytes secrete a number 
of biologic products (nonesterified free fatty acids, retinol-binding pro-
tein 4, leptin, TNF-α, resistin, IL-6, and adiponectin). Further, adipose 
resident  macrophages  are  an  important  source  of  metabolic  inflam-
mation  in  diabetes.  In  addition  to  regulating  body  weight,  appetite, 
and energy expenditure, adipokines also modulate insulin sensitivity. 
The  increased  production  of  free  fatty  acids  and  some  adipokines 
may cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver. The venous 
drainage of the visceral adipose beds is the portal circulation and this 
likely contributes to hepatic dysfunction. Free fatty acids also impair 
glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, promote glucose production by 
the liver, and impair beta cell function. In contrast, the production by 
adipocytes of adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing peptide, is reduced in 
obesity, and this may contribute to hepatic insulin resistance. Adipo-
cyte products and adipokines also produce an inflammatory state and 
may explain why markers of inflammation such as IL-6 and C-reactive 
protein are often elevated in type 2 DM.

IMPAIRED INSULIN SECRETION  Insulin  secretion  and  sensitivity  are 
interrelated  (Fig.  403-7).  In  type  2  DM,  insulin  secretion  initially 
increases in response to insulin resistance to maintain normal glucose 
tolerance. Initially, the insulin secretory defect is mild and selectively 
involves  glucose-stimulated  insulin  secretion,  including  a  greatly 
reduced first secretory phase. The response to other nonglucose secre-
tagogues, such as arginine, is preserved, but overall beta cell function 
is reduced by as much as 50% at the onset of type 2 DM. Abnormal-
ities  in  proinsulin  processing  are  reflected  by  increased  secretion  of 
proinsulin  in  type  2  DM.  Eventually,  the  insulin  secretory  defect  is 
progressive.

The  reason(s)  for  the  decline  in  insulin  secretory  capacity  in  type 
2  DM  is  unclear.  The  assumption  is  that  a  second  genetic  defect—
superimposed  upon  insulin  resistance—leads  to  defects  in  beta  cell 
function,  mass,  and  potentially  cellular  identity  and  differentiation 
status. Islet amyloid polypeptide or amylin, co-secreted by the beta cell, 
forms amyloid fibrillar deposits found in the islets of individuals with 
long-standing type 2 DM. Whether such islet amyloid deposits are a 
primary or secondary event is not known. The metabolic environment 
of diabetes also negatively impacts islet function. For example, chronic 
hyperglycemia paradoxically impairs islet function (“glucose toxicity”) 
and leads to a worsening of hyperglycemia. Improvement in glycemic 
control is often associated with improved islet function, an important 
clinical  consideration.  In  addition,  elevated  levels  of  free  fatty  acids 
(“lipotoxicity”), and systemic and local elevations in pro-inflammatory 
cytokines  from  increased  numbers  of  islet-associated  macrophages, 
may also worsen islet function.

INCREASED  HEPATIC  GLUCOSE  AND  LIPID  PRODUCTION  In  type  2 
DM, insulin resistance in the liver reflects the failure of hyperinsuline-
mia to suppress gluconeogenesis, which results in fasting hyperglyce-
mia  and  decreased  glycogen  storage  by  the  liver  in  the  postprandial 
state. Increased hepatic glucose production occurs early in the course 
of  diabetes,  although  likely  after  the  onset  of  insulin  and  glucagon 
secretory  abnormalities  and  insulin  resistance  in  skeletal  muscle.  As 
a result of insulin resistance in adipose tissue, lipolysis and free fatty 
acid flux from adipocytes are increased and efficiently cleared by liver 
leading to increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride 
synthesis in hepatocytes and secretion from liver. This is also respon-
sible for the dyslipidemia found in type 2 DM (elevated triglycerides, 
reduced  high-density  lipoprotein  [HDL],  and  increased  small  dense 
low-density  lipoprotein  [LDL]  particles).  If  this  lipid  is  retained, 
steatosis  in  the  liver  may  lead  to  nonalcoholic  fatty  liver  disease  and 
abnormal liver function tests.

Insulin Resistance Syndromes  The insulin resistance condition 
comprises  a  spectrum  of  disorders,  with  hyperglycemia  representing 
one  of  the  most  readily  diagnosed  features.  The  metabolic  syndrome, 
the  insulin  resistance  syndrome,  and  syndrome  X  are  terms  used  to 
describe  a  constellation  of  metabolic  derangements  that  includes 
insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia (decreased HDL and ele-
vated triglycerides), central or visceral obesity, type 2 DM or IGT/IFG, 
and accelerated cardiovascular disease. This syndrome is discussed in 
Chap. 408.

A  number  of  relatively  rare  forms  of  severe  insulin  resistance 
include features of type 2 DM or IGT (Table 403-1). Mutations in the 
insulin receptor that interfere with binding or signal transduction are 
a  rare  cause  of  insulin  resistance.  Acanthosis  nigricans  and  signs  of 
hyperandrogenism  (hirsutism,  acne,  and  oligomenorrhea  in  women) 
are also common physical features. Two distinct syndromes of severe 
insulin  resistance  have  been  described  in  adults:  (1)  type  A,  which 
affects  young  women  more  severely  and  is  characterized  by  severe 
hyperinsulinemia,  obesity,  and  features  of  hyperandrogenism;  and 
(2) type B, which affects middle-aged women and is characterized by 
severe hyperinsulinemia, features of hyperandrogenism, and autoim-
mune disorders. Individuals with type A insulin resistance syndrome 
have an undefined defect in the insulin-signaling pathway; individuals 
with type B insulin resistance syndrome have autoantibodies directed

3102 at the insulin receptor. These receptor autoantibodies may block insu-
lin binding or may stimulate the insulin receptor, leading to intermit-
tent hypoglycemia.

Polycystic  ovary  syndrome  (PCOS)  is  a  common  disorder  that 
affects premenopausal women and is characterized by chronic anovu-
lation  and  hyperandrogenism  (Chap.  392).  Insulin  resistance  is  seen 
in  a  significant  subset  of  women  with  PCOS,  and  the  disorder  sub-
stantially increases the risk for type 2 DM, independent of the effects 
of obesity.

Lipodystrophies  are  a  group  of  heterogeneous  disorders  charac-
terized  by  selective  loss  of  adipose  tissue,  leading  to  severe  insulin 
resistance and hypertriglyceridemia. Lipodystrophies can be inherited 
or acquired and associated with variable degrees of adipose tissue loss.

Prevention  Type 2 DM is preceded by a period of IGT or IFG, and 
a number of lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic agents prevent 
or  delay  the  onset  of  DM.  Individuals  with  prediabetes  or  increased 
risk of diabetes should be referred to a structured program to reduce 
body  weight  and  increase  physical  activity  as  well  as  being  screened 
for  cardiovascular  disease.  The  Diabetes  Prevention  Program  (DPP) 
demonstrated  that  intensive  changes  in  lifestyle  (diet  and  exercise 
for  30  min/d  five  times/week)  in  individuals  with  IGT  prevented  or 
delayed the development of type 2 DM by 58% compared to placebo. 
This  effect  was  seen  in  individuals  regardless  of  age,  sex,  or  ethnic 
group. In the same study, metformin prevented or delayed diabetes by 
31% compared to placebo. The lifestyle intervention group lost 5–7% 
of their body weight during the 3 years of the study; the effects of the 
intervention persisted for at least 15 years. Studies in Finnish and Chi-
nese populations noted similar efficacy of diet and exercise in prevent-
ing or delaying type 2 DM. A number of agents, including α-glucosidase 
inhibitors,  metformin,  thiazolidinediones,  GLP-1  receptor  pathway 
modifiers, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and orlistat, prevent or delay type 2 DM 
but  are  not  approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  for 
this purpose. Individuals with a strong family history of type 2 DM and 
individuals with IFG or IGT should be strongly encouraged to achieve 
a normal BMI and engage in regular physical activity. Pharmacologic 
therapy  for  individuals  with  prediabetes  is  currently  controversial 
because its cost-effectiveness and safety profile are not known. The ADA 
suggests that metformin be considered in individuals with both IFG and 
IGT who are at very high risk for progression to diabetes (age <60 years, 
BMI ≥35 kg/m2, and women with a history of GDM). Individuals with 
IFG,  IGT,  or  an  HbA1c  of  5.7–6.4%  should  be  monitored  annually  to 
determine if diagnostic criteria for diabetes are present.

GENETICALLY DEFINED, MONOGENIC 
FORMS OF DM RELATED TO REDUCED 
INSULIN SECRETION
Several monogenic forms of DM have been identified. Cases of matu-
rity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or monogenic diabetes are 
caused  by  mutations  in  genes  encoding  islet-enriched  transcription 
factors  or  glucokinase  (Fig.  403-5;  Table  403-1)  and  present  with  an 
autosomal dominant mode of transmission. MODY 1, MODY 3, and 
MODY 5 are caused by mutations in hepatocyte nuclear transcription 
factor (HNF) 4α, HNF-1α, and HNF-1β, respectively. As their names 
imply,  these  transcription  factors  are  expressed  in  the  liver  but  also 
in  other  tissues,  including  the  pancreatic  islets  and  kidney.  These 
factors  most  likely  affect  islet  development,  the  expression  of  genes 
important in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or the maintenance 
of beta cell mass. For example, individuals with an HNF-1α mutation 
(MODY  3)  have  a  progressive  decline  in  glycemic  control  but  may 
respond to sulfonylureas. In fact, some of these patients were initially 
thought to have type 1 DM but were later shown to respond to a sul-
fonylurea, and insulin was discontinued, a major clinical implication. 
Individuals  with  an  HNF-1β  mutation  have  progressive  impairment 
of insulin secretion and hepatic insulin resistance, and require insulin 
treatment  with  minimal  response  to  sulfonylureas.  These  individuals 
often  have  other  abnormalities  such  as  renal  cysts,  mild  pancreatic 

exocrine  insufficiency,  and  abnormal  liver  function  tests.  Individuals 
with MODY 2, the result of mutations in the glucokinase gene, have 
mild-to-moderate, but stable hyperglycemia that does not respond to 
oral hypoglycemic agents, and otherwise does not require treatment. 
Glucokinase  catalyzes  the  formation  of  glucose-6-phosphate  from 
glucose,  a  reaction  that  is  important  for  glucose  sensing  by  the  beta 
cells  (Fig.  403-5)  and  for  glucose  utilization  by  the  liver.  As  a  result 
of  glucokinase  mutations,  higher  glucose  levels  are  required  to  elicit 
insulin secretory responses, thus altering the set point for insulin secre-
tion. MODY 4 is a rare variant caused by mutations in pancreatic and 
duodenal homeobox 1, a transcription factor that regulates pancreatic 
development and insulin gene transcription. Homozygous inactivating 
mutations cause pancreatic agenesis, whereas heterozygous mutations 
may result in DM. Studies of populations with type 2 DM suggest that 
mutations in MODY-associated genes are an uncommon (<5%) cause 
of type 2 DM.

Transient or permanent neonatal diabetes (onset <6 months of age) 
occurs. Permanent neonatal diabetes is a heterogeneous group of dis-
orders caused by genetic mutations that impact beta cell function and/
or pancreatic development (Fig. 403-5). Affected individuals typically 
require  treatment  with  insulin  and  exhibit  phenotypic  overlap  with 
type 1 DM. Activating mutations in the ATP-sensitive potassium chan-
nel  subunits  (Kir6.2  and  ABCC8)  impair  glucose-stimulated  insulin 
secretion.  However,  these  individuals  may  respond  to  sulfonylureas 
and  can  be  treated  with  these  agents.  Mutations  in  the  transcription 
factor  GATA6  are  the  most  common  cause  of  pancreatic  agenesis. 
Homozygous  glucokinase  mutations  cause  a  severe  form  of  neonatal 
diabetes,  while  mutations  in  mitochondrial  DNA  are  associated  with 
diabetes and deafness. A number of mutations identified in the coding 
sequence of the insulin gene have been found to interfere with proin-
sulin folding, processing, and bioactivity and are designated as Mutant 
Ins-gene-induced  Diabetes  of  Youth  (MIDYs).  Some  of  the  neonatal 
diabetes  syndromes  are  associated  with  a  spectrum  of  neurologic 
dysfunction and a variety of extrapancreatic manifestations. Any indi-
vidual who developed diabetes at 6 months of age or who has atypical 
features of type 1 or type 2 diabetes should be screened for forms of 
monogenic diabetes.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Diabetes Mellitus

Once the diagnosis of DM is made, attention should be directed to 
symptoms  related  to  diabetes  (acute  and  chronic)  and  classifying 
the  type  of  diabetes.  DM  and  its  complications  produce  a  wide 
range of symptoms and signs; those secondary to acute hyperglyce-
mia may occur at any stage of the disease, whereas those related to 
chronic hyperglycemia typically begin to appear during the second 
decade  of  hyperglycemia  (Chap.  405).  Because  of  long  delays  in 
clinical recognition, individuals with previously undetected type 2 
DM may present with chronic complications of DM at the time of 
diagnosis. The history and physical examination should assess for 
symptoms or signs of acute hyperglycemia and screen for chronic 
microvascular  and  macrovascular  complications  and  conditions 
associated with DM (Chap. 405). 
HISTORY
A complete medical history should be obtained with special empha-
sis  on  DM-relevant  aspects  such  as  current  weight  as  well  as  any 
recent changes in weight, family history of DM and its complica-
tions, sleep history, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, exercise, 
smoking  status,  history  of  pancreatic  disease,  and  ethanol  use. 
Symptoms  of  hyperglycemia  include  polyuria,  polydipsia,  weight 
loss,  fatigue,  weakness,  blurry  vision,  frequent  superficial  infec-
tions  (vaginitis,  fungal  skin  infections),  and  slow  healing  of  skin 
lesions after minor trauma. Metabolic derangements relate mostly 
to hyperglycemia (osmotic diuresis) and to the catabolic state of the 
patient (urinary loss of glucose and calories, muscle breakdown due

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismto  protein  degradation  and  decreased  protein  synthesis).  Blurred 
vision  results  from  changes  in  the  water  content  of  the  lens  and 
resolves as hyperglycemia is controlled.

In a patient with established DM, the initial assessment should 
include  a  review  of  symptoms  at  the  time  of  the  initial  diabetes 
diagnosis.  This  is  an  essential  part  of  the  history  that  can  help 
define whether the correct type of DM has been diagnosed. Special 
emphasis should be placed on prior diabetes care, including types of 
therapies tried, the nature of any intolerance to previous therapies, 
prior HbA1c levels, self-monitoring blood glucose results, frequency 
of hypoglycemia (<3.0 mmol/L, <54 mg/dL), presence of DM-spe-
cific complications, and assessment of the patient’s knowledge about 
diabetes,  exercise,  nutrition,  and  sleep  history.  Diabetes-related 
complications may afflict several organ systems, and an individual 
patient may exhibit some, all, or none of the symptoms related to 
the complications of DM (Chap. 405). In addition, the presence of 
DM-related  comorbidities  should  be  established  (cardiovascular 
disease,  hypertension,  dyslipidemia).  Pregnancy  plans  should  be 
ascertained in women of childbearing age. The American Diabetes 
Association  recommends  that  all  women  of  childbearing  age  be 
counseled  about  the  importance  of  tight  glycemic  control  (HbA1c 
<6.5%) prior to conception. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
In  addition  to  a  complete  physical  examination,  special  attention 
should be given to DM-relevant aspects such as weight and BMI, 
retinal examination, orthostatic blood pressure, foot examination, 
peripheral pulses, and insulin injection sites. Depending on other 
risk  factors,  a  blood  pressure  >130/80  mmHg  or  >140/90  mmHg 
is  considered  hypertension  in  individuals  with  diabetes.  Because 
periodontal  disease  is  more  frequent  in  DM,  the  teeth  and  gums 
should also be examined.

An annual foot examination should (1) assess blood flow (pedal 
pulses), sensation (vibratory sensation [128-MHz tuning fork at the 
base of the great toe], the ability to sense touch with a monofilament 
[5.07, 10-g monofilament]), pinprick sensation, ankle reflexes, and 
nail care; (2) look for the presence of foot deformities such as ham-
mer or claw toes and Charcot foot; and (3) identify sites of poten-
tial ulceration. The ADA recommends annual screening for distal 
symmetric polyneuropathy beginning with the initial diagnosis of 
diabetes  and  annual  screening  for  autonomic  neuropathy  5  years 
after diagnosis of type 1 DM and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 
DM. This testing is aimed at detecting loss of protective sensation 
(LOPS) caused by diabetic neuropathy (Chap. 405). 

CLASSIFICATION OF DM IN AN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT
The etiology of diabetes in an individual with new-onset disease can 
usually be assigned on the basis of clinical criteria. Individuals with 
type 1 DM are more likely to have the following characteristics: (1) 
lean body habitus; (2) requirement of insulin as the initial therapy; 
(3) propensity to develop ketoacidosis; and (4) a family or personal 
history of other autoimmune disorders such as autoimmune thyroid 
disease,  adrenal  insufficiency,  pernicious  anemia,  celiac  disease, 
and vitiligo. In contrast, individuals with type 2 DM often exhibit 
the following features: (1) obesity; 80% are obese, but elderly indi-
viduals may be lean; (2) may not require insulin therapy initially; 
and (3) may have associated conditions such as insulin resistance, 
hypertension,  cardiovascular  disease,  dyslipidemia,  or  polycystic 
ovarian syndrome. In type 2 DM, insulin resistance is often associ-
ated with abdominal obesity (as opposed to hip and thigh obesity) 
and  hypertriglyceridemia.  Although  most  individuals  diagnosed 
with  type  2  DM  are  older,  the  age  of  diagnosis  is  declining,  and 
there is a marked increase among overweight children and adoles-
cents.  Some  individuals  with  phenotypic  type  2  DM  present  with 
diabetic  ketoacidosis  but  lack  autoimmune  markers  and  may  be 

later treated with oral glucose-lowering agents rather than insulin 
(this clinical picture is sometimes referred to as ketosis-prone type 
2  DM).  On  the  other  hand,  some  individuals  (5–10%)  with  the 
phenotypic appearance of type 2 DM do not have absolute insulin 
deficiency  but  have  autoimmune  markers  (GAD  and  other  ICA 
autoantibodies) suggestive of type 1 DM (sometimes termed latent 
autoimmune diabetes of the adult). Such individuals are more likely 
to  require  insulin  treatment  within  5  years.  Monogenic  forms  of 
diabetes should be considered in those with diabetes onset in child-
hood or early adulthood and especially those diagnosed within the 
first 6 months of life, an autosomal pattern of diabetes inheritance, 
diabetes without typical features of type 1 or 2 diabetes, and stable 
mild  fasting  hyperglycemia.  Genetic  testing  should  be  considered 
in  individuals  suspected  of  having  a  monogenic  form  of  diabetes 
as  this  may  guide  therapy  selection.  Despite  recent  advances  in 
the understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes, it often remains 
difficult to categorize some patients unequivocally. Individuals who 
deviate from the clinical profile of type 1 and type 2 DM, or who 
have other associated defects such as deafness, pancreatic exocrine 
disease  (type  3c  DM),  and  other  endocrine  disorders,  should  be 
classified  accordingly  (Table  403-1).  A  major  goal  is  personalized 
or precision medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. 
LABORATORY ASSESSMENT
The  laboratory  assessment  should  first  determine  whether  the 
patient meets the diagnostic criteria for DM (Fig. 403-1) and then 
assess the degree of glycemic control (Chap. 404). In addition to the 
standard laboratory evaluation, the patient should be screened for 
DM-associated conditions (e.g., albuminuria, dyslipidemia, thyroid 
dysfunction).

The classification of the type of DM may be facilitated by labora-
tory assessments. Serum C-peptide measurements may be useful but 
should always be interpreted with a concurrent blood glucose level. 
A  low  C-peptide  in  the  setting  of  an  elevated  blood  glucose  level 
may confirm a patient’s need for insulin. However, C-peptide levels 
are unable to completely distinguish type 1 from type 2 DM as many 
individuals with type 1 DM retain some C-peptide production. Mea-
surement  of  islet  cell  antibodies  at  the  time  of  diabetes  onset  may 
be useful if the type of DM is not clear based on the characteristics 
described above.

404 Diabetes Mellitus: 

Management and Therapies
Alvin C. Powers, Michael J. Fowler,  
Michael R. Rickels

OVERALL GOALS
The goals of therapy for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are to 
(1) eliminate symptoms related to hyperglycemia, (2) reduce or eliminate 
the  long-term  microvascular  and  macrovascular  complications  of  DM 
(Chap. 405), and (3) allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as 
possible. To reach these goals, the physician should identify a target level 
of glycemic control for each patient, provide the patient with the edu-
cational and pharmacologic resources necessary to reach this level, and 
monitor/treat DM-related complications. Symptoms of diabetes usually 
resolve when the plasma glucose is <11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and thus 
most  DM  treatment  focuses  on  achieving  the  second  and  third  goals. 
This chapter first reviews the ongoing treatment of diabetes in the outpa-
tient setting and then discusses the treatment of severe hyperglycemia, as 
well as the treatment of diabetes in hospitalized patients.

The care of an individual with either type 1 or type 2 DM requires 
a  multidisciplinary  team.  Central  to  the  success  of  this  team  are  the 
patient’s participation, input, and enthusiasm, all of which are essential 
for  optimal  diabetes  management.  Members  of  the  health  care  team 
usually include the primary care provider and/or the endocrinologist 
or diabetologist, a certified diabetes educator, a nutritionist, a psychol-
ogist, and possibly a social worker. In addition, when the complications 
of DM arise, subspecialists (including ophthalmologists, neurologists, 
podiatrists, nephrologists, cardiologists, and cardiovascular surgeons) 
with experience in DM-related complications are essential.

ONGOING ASPECTS OF COMPREHENSIVE 
DIABETES CARE
A  number  of  names  are  sometimes  applied  to  different  approaches 
to diabetes care, such as intensive insulin therapy, intensive glycemic 
control,  and  “tight  control.”  The  current  chapter,  and  other  sources, 
uses  the  term  comprehensive  diabetes  care  to  emphasize  the  fact  that 
optimal diabetes therapy involves more than glucose management and 
medications and is patient-centered and individualized as advocated by 
the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Although glycemic control 
is central to optimal diabetes therapy, comprehensive diabetes care of 
both type 1 and type 2 DM should also detect and manage DM-specific 
complications (Chap. 405), and modify risk factors for DM-associated 
diseases. The key elements of comprehensive diabetes care are summa-
rized in Table 404-1. The morbidity and mortality of DM can be greatly 
reduced by timely and consistent surveillance, including the detection, 
prevention,  and  management  of  DM-related  complications  (Table 
404-1 and Chap. 405). Such screening procedures are indicated for all 
individuals with DM, but many individuals with diabetes do not receive 
these  or  comprehensive  diabetes  care.  In  addition  to  the  physical 
aspects of DM, social, family, financial, cultural, and employment-re-
lated issues may impact diabetes care. The treatment goals for patients 
with  diabetes  summarized  in  Table  404-2  should  be  individualized. 
The  prevention  and  treatment  of  clinically  significant  hypoglycemia 
(<3.0 mmol/L or 54 mg/dL) is discussed in Chap. 406. This chapter, 
while recognizing that resources available for diabetes care vary widely 
throughout  the  world,  provides  guidance  for  comprehensive  diabetes 
care in health care settings with considerable societal resources.

Lifestyle  Management  in  Diabetes  Care  The  patient  with 
type 1 or type 2 DM should receive education about nutrition, phys-
ical activity, psychosocial support, care of diabetes during illness, and 
medications to lower the plasma glucose. Patient education allows and 
encourages  individuals  with  DM  to  assume  greater  responsibility  for 
their care, leading to improved compliance.

Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES)  
DSMES refers to ways to improve the patient’s knowledge, skills, and 
abilities  necessary  for  diabetes  self-care  and  should  also  emphasize 
psychosocial  issues  and  emotional  well-being.  Patient  education  is 
a  continuing  process  with  regular  visits  for  reinforcement;  it  is  not 
a  process  completed  after  one  or  two  visits.  It  should  receive  special 
emphasis  at  the  diagnosis  of  diabetes,  annually,  or  at  times  when 
diabetes  treatment  goals  are  not  attained,  and  during  transitions  in 
life  or  medical  care.  DSMES  is  delivered  by  a  diabetes  educator  who 
is  a  health  care  professional  (nurse,  dietician,  or  pharmacist)  with 
specialized  patient-education  skills  and  who  is  certified  in  diabetes 
education (e.g., Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists). 
Education topics important for optimal diabetes self-care include self-
monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and/or continuous glucose mon-
itoring (CGM); urine or blood ketone monitoring (type 1 DM); insulin 
administration;  guidelines  for  diabetes  management  during  illnesses;

prevention  and  management  of  hypoglycemia  (Chap.  406);  foot  and 
skin care; diabetes management before, during, and after exercise; and 
risk  factor–modifying  activities.  The  focus  is  providing  patient-cen-
tered,  individualized  education.  More  frequent  contact  between  the 
patient and the diabetes management team (e.g., electronic, telephone, 
video) improves glycemic control.

Nutrition  Therapy  Medical  nutrition  therapy  (MNT)  is  a  term 
used by the ADA to describe the optimal coordination of caloric intake 
with  other  aspects  of  diabetes  therapy  (insulin,  exercise,  and  weight 
loss). Some aspects of MNT are directed at preventing or delaying the 
onset of type 2 DM in high-risk individuals (obese or with prediabetes) 
by promoting weight reduction. Other measures of MNT are directed 
at  improving  glycemic  control  through  limiting  carbohydrate  intake 
and  avoiding  simple  sugars  and  fructose  and  managing  diabetes- 
related  complications  (cardiovascular  disease  [CVD],  nephropathy). 
Medical treatment of obesity including pharmacologic approaches that 
facilitate  weight  loss  and  metabolic  surgery  should  be  considered  in 
selected patients (Chaps. 401 and 402).

In  general,  the  components  of  optimal  MNT  are  similar  for  indi-
viduals with type 1 or type 2 DM—high-quality, nutrient-dense with 
limits on carbohydrate intake required for glycemic control and weight 
management (Table 404-3). The data are currently inconclusive about 
various  eating  patterns  (intermittent  fasting,  etc.).  Dietary  advice 
should be individualized, acknowledging personal preferences, culture, 
and  religious  traditions.  Using  the  glycemic  index,  an  estimate  of  the 
postprandial rise in the blood glucose when a certain amount of that 
food  is  consumed,  may  reduce  postprandial  glucose  excursions  and 
improve glycemic control.

The goal of MNT in type 1 DM is to coordinate and match the car-
bohydrate intake, both temporally and quantitatively, with the appro-
priate  amount  of  insulin.  MNT  in  type  1  DM  is  informed  by  SMBG 
and/or  CGM  that  should  be  integrated  to  define  the  optimal  insulin 
regimen. Based on the patient’s estimate of the carbohydrate content of 
a meal, an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio determines the bolus insulin 
dose for a meal or snack. MNT must be flexible enough to allow for 
exercise, and the insulin regimen must allow for variations in caloric

intake. An important component of MNT in type 1 DM is to minimize 
the weight gain often associated with intensive insulin therapy and is 
best achieved by placing limits on carbohydrate intake.

The goals of MNT in type 2 DM should focus on weight loss and 
address the greatly increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors 
(hypertension,  dyslipidemia,  obesity)  and  disease  in  this  population. 
The majority of these individuals are obese, and weight loss is strongly 
encouraged. Very-low-carbohydrate diets that induce weight loss may 
result  in  rapid  and  dramatic  glucose  lowering  in  individuals  with 
new-onset type 2 DM. MNT for type 2 DM should emphasize modest 
caloric  reduction,  increased  physical  activity,  and  weight  loss  (goal 
of  at  least  5–10%  loss).  Weight  loss  and  exercise  each  independently 
improve insulin sensitivity.

Fasting  for  religious  reasons,  such  as  during  Ramadan,  presents  a 
challenge for individuals with diabetes, especially those taking medica-
tions to lower the plasma glucose. Under International Diabetes Fed-
eration  (IDF)  guidelines  on  fasting  during  Ramadan,  individuals  are 
risk-stratified as those who can safely fast with medical evaluation and 
supervision  and  those  in  whom  fasting  is  not  advised.  Thus,  patient 
education and regular glucose monitoring are critical.
Physical Activity  Exercise has multiple positive benefits including 
cardiovascular risk reduction, reduced blood pressure, maintenance of 
muscle mass, reduction in body fat, and weight loss. For individuals with 
type 1 or type 2 DM, exercise is also useful for lowering plasma glucose 
(during  and  following  exercise)  and  increasing  insulin  sensitivity.  In 
patients with diabetes, the ADA recommends 150 min/week (distributed 
over at least 3 days) of moderate aerobic physical activity with no gaps 
longer than 2 days. Resistance exercise, flexibility and balance training, 
and reduced sedentary behavior throughout the day are advised.

Despite  its  benefits,  exercise  may  present  challenges  for  some 
individuals  with  DM  because  they  lack  the  normal  glucoregulatory 
mechanisms  (normally,  insulin  falls  and  glucagon  rises  during  exer-
cise).  Skeletal  muscle  is  a  major  site  for  metabolic  fuel  consumption 
in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, 
aerobic  exercise  greatly  increases  fuel  requirements.  Individuals  with 
type 1 DM are prone to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia during 
exercise, depending on the preexercise plasma glucose, the circulating 
insulin level, lactate, and the level of exercise-induced catecholamines. 
If  the  insulin  level  is  too  low,  the  delivery  of  lactate  to  the  liver  and 
rise  in  catecholamines  may  increase  the  plasma  glucose  excessively, 
promote  ketone  body  formation,  and  possibly  lead  to  ketoacidosis. 
Conversely,  if  the  circulating  insulin  level  is  excessive,  this  relative 
hyperinsulinemia  may  reduce  hepatic  glucose  production  (decreased 
glycogenolysis, decreased gluconeogenesis) and increase glucose entry 
into muscle, leading to hypoglycemia.

To avoid exercise-related hyper- or hypoglycemia, individuals with 
type 1 DM should (1) monitor blood glucose before, during, and after 
exercise; (2) delay exercise if blood glucose is >14 mmol/L (250 mg/
dL) and ketones are present; (3) if the blood glucose is <5.0 mmol/L 
(90 mg/dL), ingest carbohydrate before exercising; (4) monitor glucose 
during  exercise  and  ingest  carbohydrate  as  needed  to  prevent  hypo-
glycemia;  (5)  decrease  insulin  doses  (based  on  previous  experience) 
before and after exercise and inject insulin into a nonexercising area; 
and (6) learn individual glucose responses to different types of exer-
cise.  In  individuals  with  type  2  DM,  exercise-related  hypoglycemia 
is  less  common  but  can  occur  in  individuals  taking  either  insulin  or 
insulin secretagogues. Untreated proliferative retinopathy is a relative 
contraindication to vigorous exercise, because this may lead to vitreous 
hemorrhage or retinal detachment (Chap. 405).
Psychosocial  Care  Because  the  individual  with  DM  faces  chal-
lenges  that  affect  many  aspects  of  daily  life,  psychosocial  assessment 
and  support  are  a  critical  part  of  comprehensive  diabetes  care.  The 
patient should view himself/herself as an essential member of the dia-
betes care team and not as someone who is cared for by the diabetes 
management team. Even with considerable effort, normoglycemia can 
be  an  elusive  goal,  and  solutions  to  worsening  glycemic  control  may 
not  be  easily  identifiable.  Depression,  anxiety,  or  “diabetes  distress,” 
defined by the ADA as “…negative psychological reactions related to

3106 emotional burdens…in having to manage a chronic disease like diabe-
tes,” should be recognized and may require the care of a mental health 
specialist. Emotional stress may provoke a change in behavior so that 
individuals no longer adhere to a dietary, exercise, or therapeutic reg-
imen. Eating disorders, including binge eating disorders, bulimia, and 
anorexia nervosa, appear to occur more frequently in individuals with 
type 1 or type 2 DM.

 ■ MONITORING THE LEVEL OF  
GLYCEMIC CONTROL
Optimal  monitoring  of  glycemic  control  involves  glucose  measure-
ments  by  the  patient  and  an  assessment  of  long-term  control  by  the 
providers on the diabetes management team (measurement of hemo-
globin  A1c  [HbA1c]  and  review  of  the  patient’s  SMBG  and/or  CGM). 
These measurements are complementary: the patient’s measurements 
provide  a  picture  of  short-term  glycemic  control,  whereas  the  HbA1c 
reflects average glycemic control over the previous 2–3 months. Most 
measurements should be performed prior to a meal and supplemented 
with  postprandial  measurements  to  assist  in  reaching  glucose  targets 
(Table 404-2). By combining glucose measurements with diet and exer-
cise history, the diabetes management team and patient can improve 
glycemic  control.  Clinical  practice  is  changing  rapidly  with  CGM 
replacing SMBG is many patients, especially those with T1 DM.

Self-Monitoring  of  Blood  Glucose 
In  SMBG,  a  small  drop  of 
blood (3–10 μL) and an enzymatic reaction allow rapid and accurate 
measurement of the capillary blood glucose by glucose monitors (cal-
ibrated  to  provide  plasma  glucose  value  even  though  blood  glucose 
is  measured).  The  blood  is  obtained  from  the  fingertip;  alternative 
testing  sites  (e.g.,  forearm)  are  less  reliable.  The  frequency  of  SMBG 
measurements should be individualized. Individuals with type 1 DM 
or individuals with type 2 DM taking multiple insulin injections each 
day should measure their blood glucose >3 times/day (some measure 
>10 times/day). Most individuals with type 2 DM require less frequent 
monitoring,  although  the  optimal  frequency  of  SMBG  has  not  been 
clearly  defined.  Individuals  with  type  2  DM  who  are  taking  insulin 

should use SMBG more frequently than those on oral agents. Individ-
uals with type 2 DM who are on oral medications should use SMBG 
as a means of assessing the efficacy of their medication and the impact 
of dietary choices and exercise. Because glucose levels fluctuate less in 
these  individuals,  one  or  two  SMBG  measurements  per  day  may  be 
sufficient.

Continuous  Glucose  Monitoring  CGM  technology  utilizes  a 
sensor  or  electrode  to  detect  interstitial  glucose,  which  is  in  equilib-
rium with blood glucose, but may lag behind when the blood glucose 
is changing. In one CGM approach, the interstitial glucose is detected 
and reported essentially continuously while in another approach, the 
sensor is in place, but the glucose is only recorded when a detector is 
placed over the sensor. The glucose sensors are placed subcutaneously 
and  are  replaced  every  3–14  days.  Some  CGM  requires  calibration 
by  SMBG.  CGM  provides  unlimited  glucose  datapoints  that  can  be 
used to define a time in a glycemic range (TIR, or time in range), the 
ambulatory  glucose  profile,  the  amount  of  time  in  the  hypoglycemic 
range, and the glucose management indicator (GMI), which correlates 
with A1C (Fig. 404-1; Table 404-2). TIR and GMI are useful metrics 
but CGM also allows the patient to monitor the rate of glucose change 
and glucose trends that can be used to avoid predicted hyper- or hypo-
glycemia. CGM in type 1 DM especially in those with hypoglycemia 
unawareness  can  decrease  the  frequency  of  serious  hypoglycemia 
(especially  nocturnal  hypoglycemia).  The  combination  of  an  insu-
lin-infusion device (discussed below) and a CGM can now automate 
insulin delivery with either predictive suspension of insulin delivery to 
avoid hypoglycemia or closed-loop control that automatically adjusts 
insulin delivery by a predictive algorithm (Fig. 404-1).

Assessment  of  Long-Term  Glycemic  Control  Measurement 
of  glycated  hemoglobin  (HbA1c)  is  the  standard  method  for  assessing 
long-term  glycemic  control.  When  plasma  glucose  is  consistently  ele-
vated, there is an increase in nonenzymatic glycation of hemoglobin; this 
alteration reflects the glycemic history over the previous 2–3 months, 
because  erythrocytes  have  an  average  life  span  of  120  days  (glycemic

level  in  the  preceding  month  contributes  about  50%  to  the  HbA1c 
value). Measurement of HbA1c at the “point of care” allows for more 
rapid feedback and may therefore assist in adjustment of therapy.

HbA1c should be measured in all individuals with DM during their 
initial evaluation and as part of their comprehensive diabetes care. 
As the primary predictor of long-term complications of DM, the HbA1c 
should  mirror,  to  a  certain  extent,  the  short-term  measurement  by 
SMBG or CGM. Measurements of HbA1c and actual glucose levels are 
complementary in that recent intercurrent illnesses may impact SMBG 
or  CGM  measurements  but  not  the  HbA1c.  The  HbA1c  may  reflect 
postprandial  or  nocturnal  hyperglycemia  not  detected  by  SMBG  of 
fasting and preprandial capillary blood glucose. However, it does not 
detect  interprandial  or  nocturnal  hypoglycemia—these  require  very 
frequent SMBG or CGM for detection. The HbA1c is an “average” and 
thus does not detect glycemic variability in the way SMBG and CGM 
can.  In  standardized  assays,  the  HbA1c  approximates  the  following 
mean plasma glucose values: an HbA1c of 6% = 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/
dL), 7% = 8.6 mmol/L (154 mg/dL), 8% = 10.2 mmol/L (183 mg/dL), 
9%  =  11.8  mmol/L  (212  mg/dL),  10%  =  13.4  mmol/L  (240  mg/dL), 
11% = 14.9 mmol/L (269 mg/dL), and 12% = 16.5 mmol/L (298 mg/
dL). However, there is interindividual variability in the HbA1c to mean 
glucose relationship, and in blacks the HbA1c is on average 0.4% higher 
than in whites for the same mean glucose. Clinical conditions leading 
to  abnormal  RBC  parameters  such  as  hemoglobinopathies,  anemias, 
reticulocytosis,  transfusions,  and  uremia  may  alter  the  HbA1c  result. 
In patients achieving their glycemic goal, the ADA recommends mea-
surement  of  the  HbA1c  at  least  twice  per  year.  More  frequent  testing 
(every  3  months)  is  warranted  when  glycemic  control  is  inadequate 
or when therapy has changed. Laboratory standards for the HbA1c test 
have been established and should be correlated to the reference assay 
of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The degree 
of  glycation  of  other  proteins,  such  as  albumin,  or  measurement  of 
1,5-anhydroglucitol can be used as an alternative, shorter-term indica-
tor of glycemic control when the HbA1c is inaccurate. The fructosamine 
assay  (measuring  glycated  albumin)  reflects  the  glycemic  status  over 
the prior 2 weeks.

PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT  
OF DIABETES
Comprehensive care of type 1 and type 2 DM requires an emphasis on 
nutrition, exercise, and monitoring of glycemic control but also usually 
involves glucose-lowering medication(s). This chapter discusses classes 
of  such  medications  but  does  not  describe  every  glucose-lowering 
agent available worldwide. The initial step is to select an individualized, 
glycemic goal for the patient.
 ■ ESTABLISHMENT OF TARGET LEVEL OF 
GLYCEMIC CONTROL
Because  the  complications  of  DM  are  related  to  glycemic  control, 
normoglycemia or near-normoglycemia is the desired, but often elu-
sive,  goal  for  most  patients.  Normalization  or  near-normalization  of 
the  plasma  glucose  for  long  periods  of  time  is  extremely  difficult,  as 
demonstrated by the DCCT and United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes 
Study  (UKPDS).  Regardless  of  the  level  of  hyperglycemia,  improve-
ment in glycemic control will lower the risk of diabetes-specific com-
plications, most notably the microvascular complications (Chap. 405).
The target for glycemic control (as reflected by the HbA1c) must be 
individualized, and the goals of therapy should be developed in consul-
tation with the patient after considering a number of medical, social, 
and lifestyle issues. The ADA calls this a patient-centered approach, and 
other organizations such as the IDF and American Association of Clin-
ical Endocrinologists (AACE) also suggest an individualized glycemic 
goal. Important factors to consider include the patient’s age and ability 
to understand and implement a complex treatment regimen, presence 
and severity of complications of diabetes, known CVD, ability to recog-
nize hypoglycemic symptoms, presence of other medical conditions or 
treatments that might affect survival or the response to therapy, lifestyle 
and occupation (e.g., possible consequences of experiencing hypoglyce-
mia on the job), and level of support available from family and friends.

In general, the ADA suggests that the goal is to achieve an HbA1c as 
close  to  normal  as  possible  without  significant  hypoglycemia.  In  most 
individuals, the target HbA1c should be <7% (Table 404-2) with a more 
stringent (≤6.5%) target for some patients. With modern implementa-
tion of intensive insulin therapy for type 1 DM, the level of HbA1c is no 
longer inversely related to the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia as 
seen in the DCCT; nevertheless, it may still be appropriate to set a higher 
HbA1c target <7.5 or 8% for patients with impaired awareness of hypogly-
cemia. A higher HbA1c goal may also be appropriate for the very young 
or old or in individuals with limited life span or comorbid conditions. 
For individuals using CGM, maximizing time-in-range 70–180 mg/dL, 
representing  normoglycemia,  while  minimizing  time-below-range  <70 
mg/dL, representing hypoglycemia, are shorter-term targets of therapy.

More stringent glycemic control (HbA1c ≤6%) is not beneficial, and 
may  be  detrimental,  in  patients  with  type  2  DM  and  a  high  risk  of 
CVD. Large clinical trials (UKPDS, Action to Control Cardiovascular 
Risk in Diabetes [ACCORD], Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: 
Preterax  and  Diamicron  MR  Controlled  Evaluation  [ADVANCE], 
Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial [VADT]; Chap. 405) examined glyce-
mic control in type 2 DM in individuals with low risk of CVD, with 
high risk of CVD, or with established CVD and have found that more 
intense glycemic control is not beneficial and, in some patient popula-
tions, may have a negative impact on some outcomes. These divergent 
outcomes  stress  the  need  for  individualized  glycemic  goals  based  on 
the following general guidelines: (1) early in the course of type 2 dia-
betes  when  the  CVD  risk  is  lower,  improved  glycemic  control  likely 
leads to improved cardiovascular outcome, but this benefit may occur 
more than a decade after the period of improved glycemic control; (2) 
intense  glycemic  control  in  individuals  with  established  CVD  or  at 
high risk for CVD is not advantageous, and may be deleterious, over a 
follow-up of 3–5 years; (3) hypoglycemia in such high-risk populations 
(elderly, CVD) should be avoided; and (4) improved glycemic control 
reduces microvascular complications of diabetes (Chap. 405) even if it 
does not improve macrovascular complications like CVD.
 ■ TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS
General Aspects  The  ADA  recommendations  for  glycemic  goals 
and  HbA1c  targets  are  summarized  in  Table  404-2.  The  goal  is  to 
design and implement insulin regimens that mimic physiologic insulin 
secretion. Because individuals with type 1 DM partially or completely 
lack  endogenous  insulin  production,  administration  of  basal  insulin 
is  essential  for  regulating  glycogen  breakdown,  gluconeogenesis, 
lipolysis, and ketogenesis (i.e., largely fine-tuning hepatic and adipose 
metabolism). Likewise, insulin replacement for meals should be appro-
priate  for  the  carbohydrate  intake  and  insulin  sensitivity,  promoting 
normal glucose utilization and storage.

Intensive  Management 
Intensive  insulin  therapy  has  the  goal 
of  achieving  near-normal  glycemia.  This  approach  requires  multiple 
resources, including thorough and continuing patient education, com-
prehensive  recording  of  plasma  glucose  measurements  and  nutrition 
intake  by  the  patient,  and  a  variable  insulin  regimen  that  matches 
carbohydrate intake and insulin dose. Insulin regimens include multi-
ple-component insulin regimens, multiple daily injections (MDIs), or 
continuous subcutaneous (SC) insulin infusion (CSII).

The benefits of intensive insulin therapy and improved glycemic con-
trol include a reduction in the acute metabolic and chronic microvascu-
lar complications of DM. From a psychological standpoint, the patient 
experiences greater control over his or her diabetes and often notes an 
improved sense of well-being, greater flexibility in the timing and con-
tent  of  meals,  and  the  capability  to  alter  insulin  dosing  with  exercise. 
In  addition,  intensive  insulin  therapy  prior  to  and  during  pregnancy 
reduces the risk of fetal malformations and morbidity. Intensive insulin 
therapy  is  encouraged  in  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  type  1  DM 
because it may prolong the period of C-peptide production, which may 
result in better glycemic control and a reduced risk of serious hypogly-
cemia.  Although  intensive  management  confers  impressive  benefits, 
it is also accompanied by significant personal and financial costs and 
therefore may not be appropriate at all times for all individuals.

aInjectable insulin preparations (with exception of inhaled formulation) available in 
the United States; others are available in the United Kingdom and Europe. Standard 
formulations are U-100 (100 units of insulin per mL solution). bFormulation with 
niacinamide (vitamin B3) has a slightly more rapid onset and offset. cLispro-aabc 
formulation has a slightly more rapid onset and offset; both formulations are also

concentration with delayed onset and offset. hOther insulin combinations are 
available. iDual: two peaks—one at 2–3 h and the second one several hours later.

Insulin  Preparations  Current  insulin  preparations  are  gener-
ated by recombinant DNA technology and consist of the amino acid 
sequence of human insulin or variations thereof. In the United States, 
most  insulin  is  formulated  as  U-100  (100  units/mL);  short-acting 
insulin formulated as U-200 (200 units/mL; lispro) and long-acting as 
U-300 (300 units/mL; glargine) are available in order to limit injection 
volumes  for  patients  with  high  insulin  requirements.  Regular  insulin 
formulated as U-500 (500 units/mL) is sometimes used in patients with 
severe insulin resistance. Human insulin has been formulated with dis-
tinctive  pharmacokinetics  (regular  and  neutral  protamine  Hagedorn 
[NPH] insulin have the native insulin amino acid sequence) or genet-
ically  modified  to  alter  insulin  absorption  and  hence  insulin  action. 
Insulins can be classified as short-acting or long-acting (Table 404-4; 
Figure  404-1D).  For  example,  one  short-acting  insulin  formulation, 
insulin lispro, is an insulin analogue in which the 28th and 29th amino 
acids (lysine and proline) on the insulin B chain have been reversed by 
recombinant DNA technology. Insulin aspart and insulin glulisine are 
genetically modified insulin analogues with properties similar to lispro. 
A biosimilar version of lispro has been approved. These insulin ana-
logues have full biologic activity but less tendency for self-aggregation, 
resulting in more rapid absorption and onset of action and a shorter 
duration of action. These characteristics are particularly advantageous 
for  allowing  entrainment  of  insulin  injection  and  action  to  rising 
plasma glucose levels following meals. The shorter duration of action 
also appears to be associated with a decreased number of hypoglycemic 
episodes, primarily because the decay of insulin action corresponds to 
the decline in plasma glucose after a meal. Thus, insulin aspart, lispro, 
or  glulisine  is  preferred  over  regular  insulin  for  prandial  coverage  in 
many  patients.  Insulin  glargine  is  a  long-acting  biosynthetic  human 
insulin that differs from normal insulin in that asparagine is replaced 

by  glycine  at  amino  acid  21,  and  two  arginine  residues  are  added  to 
the C terminus of the B chain, leading to the formation of micropre-
cipitates at physiologic pH in subcutaneous tissue. Compared to NPH 
insulin,  the  onset  of  insulin  glargine  action  is  later,  the  duration  of 
action is longer (~24 h), and there is a less pronounced peak. A lower 
incidence of hypoglycemia, especially at night, has been reported with 
insulin glargine when compared to NPH insulin. A biosimilar version 
is available. Insulin detemir has a fatty acid side chain that reversibly 
binds  to  albumin  and  prolongs  its  action  by  slowing  absorption  and 
catabolism, but its duration of action may only reach 12–20 h. Twice-
daily  injections  of  glargine,  or  especially  detemir,  are  sometimes 
required  to  provide  optimal  24-h  basal  insulin  coverage.  Because  of 
modification  and  extension  of  the  carboxy-terminus  of  the  B  chain, 
insulin  degludec  forms  multihexamers  in  subcutaneous  tissue  and 
binds albumin, prolonging its duration of action (>42 h); it provides 
similar  glycemic  control  as  glargine  but  with  less  frequent  nocturnal 
and severe hypoglycemia. Other modified insulins, such as one with a 
duration of action of several days, are in development.

Basal insulin requirements are provided by long-acting insulin for-
mulations  (NPH  insulin,  insulin  glargine,  insulin  detemir,  or  insulin 
degludec)  (Fig.  404-1D;  Table  404-4).  These  are  usually  prescribed 
with  short-acting  insulin  in  an  attempt  to  mimic  physiologic  insulin 
release with meals. Although mixing of NPH and short-acting insulin 
formulations  is  common  practice,  this  mixing  may  alter  the  insulin 
absorption profile (especially the short-acting insulins). For example, 
lispro  absorption  is  delayed  by  mixing  with  NPH.  The  alteration  in 
insulin  absorption  when  the  patient  mixes  different  insulin  formu-
lations  should  not  prevent  mixing  insulins.  However,  the  following 
guidelines should be followed: (1) mix the different insulin formula-
tions in the syringe immediately before injection (inject within 2 min 
after mixing); (2) do not store insulin as a mixture; (3) follow the same 
routine in terms of insulin mixing and administration to standardize 
the physiologic response to injected insulin; and (4) do not mix insulin 
glargine,  detemir,  or  degludec  with  other  insulins.  The  miscibility  of 
some insulins allows for the production of combination insulins that 
contain 70% NPH and 30% regular (70/30), or equal mixtures of NPH 
and  regular  (50/50).  By  including  the  insulin  analogue  mixed  with 
protamine,  several  additional  combinations  have  a  short-acting  and 
long-acting  profile  (Table  404-4;  Fig.  404-1D).  Although  more  con-
venient for the patient (only two injections/day), combination insulin 
formulations  do  not  allow  independent  adjustment  of  short-acting 
and  long-acting  activity.  Several  insulin  formulations  are  available  as 
insulin “pens,” which are more convenient for some patients. Insulin 
delivery by inhalation to provide meal-time insulin is approved, but not 
widely used. Prior to its use, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1) should be measured. Inhaled insulin can cause bronchospasm 
and  cough  and  should  not  be  used  by  individuals  with  lung  disease 
or  those  who  smoke.  Long-acting  insulin/glucagon-like  peptide-1 
(GLP-1)  receptor  agonist  combinations  in  fixed  doses  (degludec  + 
liraglutide or glargine + lixisenatide) are effective, and are associated 
with less weight gain.

Insulin  Regimens  There  is  considerable  patient-to-patient  vari-
ation  in  the  peak  and  duration.  In  all  regimens,  long-acting  insulins 
(NPH,  glargine,  detemir,  or  degludec)  supply  basal  insulin,  whereas 
regular,  insulin  aspart,  glulisine,  or  lispro  provide  prandial  insulin 
(Fig.  404-1D; Table 404-4). Short-acting insulin analogues should be 
injected just before (<10 min) and regular insulin 30–45 min prior to a 
meal. Sometimes short-acting insulin analogues are injected just after 
a meal (gastroparesis, unpredictable food intake).

A shortcoming of current insulin regimens is that injected insulin 
immediately enters the systemic circulation, whereas endogenous insu-
lin is secreted into the portal venous system. Thus, exogenous insulin 
administration  exposes  the  liver  to  subphysiologic  insulin  levels.  No 
current insulin regimen reproduces the precise insulin secretory pat-
tern  of  the  pancreatic  islet.  However,  the  most  physiologic  regimens 
entail more frequent insulin injections, greater reliance on short-acting 
insulin, and more frequent SMBG and/or CGM. In general, individuals 
with type 1 DM require 0.3-0.7 units/kg per day of insulin divided into

multiple doses, with approximately 50% of daily insulin given as basal 
insulin and 50% as prandial insulin.

MDI regimens refer to the combination of basal insulin and bolus 
insulin  (preprandial  short-acting  insulin).  The  timing  and  dose  of 
short-acting,  preprandial  insulin  are  altered  to  accommodate  the 
SMBG or CGM results, anticipated food intake, and physical activity. 
Such  regimens  offer  the  patient  with  type  1  DM  more  flexibility  in 
terms  of  lifestyle  and  the  best  chance  for  achieving  near  normogly-
cemia. Most often basal insulin with glargine, detemir, or degludec is 
used in conjunction with preprandial lispro, glulisine, or insulin aspart. 
The insulin aspart, glulisine, or lispro dose is based on individualized 
algorithms that integrate the preprandial glucose and the anticipated 
carbohydrate intake. To determine the meal component of the prepran-
dial insulin dose, the patient uses an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (a 
common ratio for type 1 DM is 1 unit/10–15 g of carbohydrate, but this 
must be determined for each individual). To this insulin dose is added 
the supplemental or correcting insulin based on the preprandial blood 
glucose (one formula uses 1 unit of insulin for every 1.6–3.3 mmol/L 
[30–60  mg/dL]  over  the  preprandial  glucose  target;  this  correction 
factor  can  be  estimated  from  1500/[total  daily  insulin  dose]).  Such 
calculations must be adjusted based on each individual’s sensitivity to 
insulin. Other variations of this regimen use twice daily NPH as basal 
insulin  but  have  the  disadvantage  that  NPH  has  a  significant  peak, 
making hypoglycemia more common. Frequent SMBG (≥4 times per 
day) or CGM is essential for these types of insulin regimens.

CSII is a very effective insulin regimen for the patient with type 1 
DM (Fig. 404-1). To the basal insulin infusion, a preprandial insulin 
(“bolus”) is delivered by the insulin infusion device based on instruc-
tions from the patient, who uses an individualized algorithm incorpo-
rating  the  preprandial  plasma  glucose  and  anticipated  carbohydrate 
intake. These sophisticated devices can accurately deliver small doses 
of insulin (microliters per hour) and have several advantages: (1) multi-
ple basal infusion rates can be programmed to accommodate nocturnal 
versus daytime basal insulin requirement; (2) basal infusion rates can 
be altered during periods of exercise; (3) different waveforms of insu-
lin infusion with meal-related bolus allow better matching of insulin 
depending  on  meal  composition;  and  (4)  programmed  algorithms 
consider  ongoing  action  of  prior  insulin  administration  and  blood 
glucose  values  in  calculating  the  insulin  dose.  These  devices  require 
instruction by a health professional with considerable experience with 
insulin infusion devices and frequent patient interactions with the dia-
betes management team. Insulin infusion devices may present unique 
challenges, such as infection at the infusion site, unexplained hypergly-
cemia because the infusion set becomes obstructed, or diabetic ketoaci-
dosis  (DKA)  if  the  insulin  infusion  device  becomes  disconnected. 
Because most physicians use lispro, glulisine, or insulin aspart in CSII, 
the extremely short half-life of these insulins quickly leads to insulin 
deficiency  if  the  delivery  system  is  interrupted.  Essential  to  the  safe 
use of infusion devices is thorough patient education, frequent SMBG 
and/or  CGM,  and  a  backup  plan  for  injecting  long-  and/or  rapid- 
acting  insulins  in  the  event  of  insulin  infusion  device  failure.  CGM  
sensor-augmented  insulin  infusion  devices  integrate  the  information 
from  the  CGM  to  inform  insulin  delivery  (Fig.  404-1).  Currently, 
sensor  communicating  functions  can  interrupt  basal  insulin  delivery 
during hypoglycemia (threshold suspension) or when hypoglycemia is 
anticipated (predictive suspension), which may be particularly useful 
for  addressing  nocturnal  hypoglycemia.  Hybrid  closed-loop  systems 
have recently become available that combine patient-directed prepran-
dial  boluses  with  automated  adjustment  of  between-meal  and  basal 
insulin delivery based on CGM. Clinical experience with closed-loop 
systems  is  rapidly  increasing  and  expanding.  Bihormonal  infusion 
devices that deliver both insulin and glucagon are under development.

Other  Agents  That  Improve  Glucose  Control  The  role  of 
amylin,  a  37-amino-acid  peptide  co-secreted  with  insulin  from  pan-
creatic beta cells, in normal glucose homeostasis is uncertain. However, 
based on the rationale that patients who are insulin deficient are also 
amylin deficient, an analogue of amylin (pramlintide) was created and 
found to reduce postprandial glycemic excursions in individuals with

type  1  or  type  2  DM  taking  insulin.  Pramlintide  injected  just  before 
a meal slows gastric emptying and suppresses glucagon but does not 
alter insulin levels. Pramlintide is approved for insulin-treated patients 
with type 1 or type 2 DM. Addition of pramlintide produces a modest 
reduction  in  the  HbA1c  and  seems  to  dampen  meal-related  glucose 
excursions. In type 1 DM, pramlintide is started as a 15-μg SC injection 
before each meal and titrated up to a maximum of 30–60 μg as toler-
ated. In type 2 DM, pramlintide is started as a 60-μg SC injection before 
each meal and may be titrated up to a maximum of 120 μg. The major 
side  effects  are  nausea  and  vomiting,  and  dose  escalations  should  be 
slow to limit these side effects. Because pramlintide slows gastric emp-
tying, it may influence absorption of other medications and should not 
be used in combination with other drugs that slow gastrointestinal (GI) 
motility. The short-acting insulin given before the meal should initially 
be  reduced  to  avoid  hypoglycemia  and  then  titrated  as  the  effects  of 
the pramlintide become evident. Because pramlintide suppresses glu-
cagon, it may worsen hypoglycemia recovery and should not be used 
in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness.

 ■ TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
General  Aspects  The  goals  of  glycemia-controlling  therapy  for 
type 2 DM are similar to those in type 1 DM. Whereas glycemic control 
tends  to  dominate  the  management  of  type  1  DM,  the  care  of  indi-
viduals with type 2 DM must also include attention to the treatment 
of  conditions  associated  with  type  2  DM  (e.g.,  obesity,  hypertension, 
dyslipidemia,  CVD)  and  detection/management  of  DM-related  com-
plications (Fig. 404-2; Chap. 405). Reduction in cardiovascular risk is 
of paramount importance because this is the leading cause of mortality 
in these individuals.

Type 2 DM management should begin with MNT (discussed above). 
An exercise regimen to increase insulin sensitivity and promote weight 
loss should also be instituted. Pharmacologic approaches to the man-
agement  of  type  2  DM  include  oral  glucose-lowering  agents,  insulin, 
and  other  agents  that  improve  glucose  control;  most  physicians  and 
patients prefer oral glucose-lowering agents as the initial choice. Any 
therapy  that  improves  glycemic  control  reduces  “glucose  toxicity”  to 
beta  cells  and  may  improve  endogenous  insulin  secretion.  However, 
type 2 DM is a progressive disorder and ultimately requires multiple 
therapeutic agents and often insulin in most patients.

Glucose-Lowering  Agents  Advances  in  the  therapy  of  type  2 
DM have generated oral glucose-lowering agents that target different 
pathophysiologic processes in type 2 DM. Based on their mechanisms 
of  action,  glucose-lowering  agents  are  subdivided  into  agents  that 
increase insulin secretion, reduce glucose production, increase insulin 
sensitivity, enhance GLP-1 action, or promote urinary excretion of glu-
cose (Table 404-5). Glucose-lowering agents other than insulin (with 
the  exception  of  amylin  analogue)  are  ineffective  in  type  1  DM  and 
should not be used for glucose management of severely ill individuals 
with type 2 DM. Insulin is sometimes the initial glucose-lowering agent 
in type 2 DM.

BIGUANIDES  Metformin, representative of this class of agents, reduces 
hepatic glucose production and improves peripheral glucose utilization 
slightly  (Table  404-5).  Metformin  activates  AMP-dependent  protein 
kinase and enters cells through organic cation transporters (polymor-
phisms of these may influence the response to metformin). Metformin 
acts  in  multiple  tissues,  but  its  mechanism  of  action  remains  unde-
fined.  There  is  evidence  for  reducing  hepatic  glucose  production  by 
antagonizing cAMP generation in hepatocytes as well as for actions in 
the gut. Metformin reduces fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin 
levels, improves the lipid profile, and promotes modest weight loss. An 
extended-release form is available and may have fewer GI side effects 

(diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, metallic taste). Because of its metformin’s 
relatively  slow  onset  of  action  and  GI  symptoms  with  higher  doses, 
the initial dose should be low and then escalated every 1–2 weeks to 
a maximally tolerated dose of 2000 mg daily. Metformin is effective as 
monotherapy and can be used in combination with other oral agents 
or with insulin. Long-term use is associated with reduced micro- and 
macrovascular complications. The major toxicity of metformin, lactic 
acidosis, is very rare and can be prevented by careful patient selection. 
Vitamin B12 levels are lower during metformin treatment and should be 
monitored. Metformin should not be used in patients with moderate 
renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <30 mL/min), any

form of acidosis, unstable congestive heart failure (CHF), liver disease, 
or severe hypoxemia. Metformin should be discontinued in hospital-
ized  patients,  in  patients  who  can  take  nothing  orally,  and  in  those 
receiving radiographic contrast material. Insulin should be used until 
metformin can be restarted.

INSULIN SECRETAGOGUES—AGENTS THAT AFFECT THE ATP-SENSITIVE 
K+  CHANNEL  Insulin  secretagogues  stimulate  insulin  secretion  by 
interacting with the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the beta cell 
(Chap. 403). These drugs are most effective in individuals with type 2 
DM of relatively recent onset (<5 years) who have residual endogenous 
insulin  production.  First-generation  sulfonylureas  (chlorpropamide, 
tolazamide,  tolbutamide)  have  a  longer  half-life,  a  greater  incidence 
of  hypoglycemia,  and  more  frequent  drug  interactions,  and  are  no 
longer used. Second-generation sulfonylureas have a more rapid onset 
of action and better coverage of the postprandial glucose rise, but the 
shorter  half-life  of  some  agents  may  require  more  than  once-a-day 
dosing.  Sulfonylureas  reduce  both  fasting  and  postprandial  glucose 
and  should  be  initiated  at  low  doses  and  increased  at  1-  to  2-week 
intervals  based  on  SMBG.  In  general,  sulfonylureas  increase  insulin 
acutely and thus should be taken shortly before a meal; with chronic 
therapy, though, the insulin release is more sustained. Long-term use 
is  associated  with  reduced  micro-  and  macrovascular  complications. 
Glimepiride and glipizide can be given in a single daily dose and are 
preferred  over  glyburide,  especially  in  the  elderly.  Repaglinide,  nate-
glinide,  and  mitiglinide  are  not  sulfonylureas  but  also  interact  with 
the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Because of their short half-life, 
these glinide agents are given immediately before each meal to reduce 
meal-related glucose excursions.

Insulin  secretagogues,  especially  the  longer  acting  ones,  have  the 
potential  to  cause  hypoglycemia,  especially  in  elderly  individuals. 
Hypoglycemia  is  usually  related  to  delayed  meals,  increased  physical 
activity,  alcohol  intake,  or  renal  insufficiency.  Individuals  who  ingest 
an  overdose  of  some  agents  develop  prolonged  and  serious  hypogly-
cemia  and  should  be  monitored  closely  in  the  hospital  (Chap.  406). 
Most sulfonylureas are metabolized in the liver to compounds (some 
of which are active, such as those of glyburide and the glinide nateg-
linide)  that  are  cleared  by  the  kidney.  Thus,  their  use  in  individuals 
with  significant  hepatic  or  renal  dysfunction  is  not  advisable.  For 
patients  with  chronic  kidney  disease  requiring  an  insulin  secreta-
gogue, the shorter-acting sulfonylureas glimepiride or glipizide or the 
glinide repaglinide may be used with caution. Weight gain, a common 
side effect of sulfonylurea therapy, results from the increased insulin 
levels and improvement in glycemic control. Some sulfonylureas have 
significant  drug  interactions  with  alcohol  and  some  medications 
including  warfarin,  aspirin,  ketoconazole,  α-glucosidase  inhibitors, 
and fluconazole. A related isoform of ATP-sensitive potassium chan-
nels is present in the myocardium and the brain. All of these agents 
except glyburide have a low affinity for this isoform. Despite concerns 
that this agent might affect the myocardial response to ischemia and 
observational studies suggesting that sulfonylureas increase cardiovas-
cular risk, studies have not shown an increased cardiac mortality with 
glyburide or other agents in this class.

INSULIN SECRETAGOGUES—AGENTS THAT ENHANCE GLP-1 RECEPTOR 
SIGNALING  “Incretins”  amplify  glucose-stimulated  insulin  secretion 
(Chap.  403).  Agents  that  either  act  as  a  GLP-1  receptor  agonist  or 
enhance endogenous GLP-1 activity are approved for the treatment of 
type 2 DM (Table 404-5). Agents in this class do not cause hypoglyce-
mia  because  of  the  glucose-dependent  nature  of  incretin-stimulated 
insulin secretion (unless there is concomitant use of an agent that can 
lead  to  hypoglycemia—sulfonylureas,  etc.).  GLP-1  receptor  agonists 
increase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suppress glucagon, and 
slow  gastric  emptying.  These  agents  do  not  promote  weight  gain;  in 
fact, most patients experience modest weight loss and appetite suppres-
sion.  Short-acting  GLP-1  receptor  agonists  are  exenatide  twice  daily, 
liraglutide  daily,  and  lixisenatide  daily.  Long-acting  GLP-1  receptor 
agonists include sustained-release exenatide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, 
and semaglutide, all administered weekly. Short-acting GLP-1 receptor 

agonists provide mostly postprandial coverage whereas the long-acting 
GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce both the postprandial and fasting glu-
cose. Daily oral semaglutide is now available that depends on gastric 
absorption to avoid proteolytic degradation in the small intestine. All 
are modified to avoid enzymatic inactivation by dipeptidyl peptidase 
IV (DPP-IV) in the circulation.

For  example,  exenatide,  a  synthetic  version  of  a  peptide  initially 
identified in the saliva of the Gila monster (exendin-4), is an analogue 
of  GLP-1.  Unlike  native  GLP-1,  which  has  a  half-life  of  ~2  min,  dif-
ferences  in  the  exenatide  amino  acid  sequence  render  it  resistant  to 
DPP-IV. Thus, exenatide has prolonged GLP-1-like action. Liraglutide, 
another  GLP-1  receptor  agonist,  is  almost  identical  to  native  GLP-1 
except  for  an  amino  acid  substitution  and  addition  of  a  fatty  acyl 
group  (coupled  with  a  γ-glutamic  acid  spacer)  that  promote  binding 
to albumin and plasma proteins and prolong its half-life. Higher doses 
of  liraglutide  and  semaglutide  than  used  for  glucose-lowering  effects 
are effective for weight-loss therapy for obesity. Liraglutide treatment 
has  also  been  associated  with  a  decrease  in  CVD  events  in  patients 
with type 2 DM and established CVD and with lower rates of diabetic 
kidney disease. In similar patient populations, semaglutide treatment 
has  been  associated  with  fewer  CVD  events  and  reduced  diabetic 
kidney disease, but with an increased rate of retinopathy-related com-
plications, while dulaglutide treatment has been associated with both a 
reduction in CVD events and in composite microvascular retinopathy 
and  nephropathy-related  complications  primarily  driven  by  preven-
tion of renal events. Similar reductions in CVD events have not been 
observed  with  exenatide  once  weekly  or  lixisenatide.  Treatment  with 
GLP-1 receptor agonists should start at a low dose to minimize initial 
side  effects  (nausea  being  the  limiting  one).  GLP-1  receptor  agonists 
can  be  used  as  combination  therapy  with  metformin,  sulfonylureas, 
and  thiazolidinediones.  Some  patients  taking  insulin  secretagogues 
may require a reduction in those agents to prevent hypoglycemia. The 
major side effects are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some formula-
tions carry a black box warning from the FDA because of an increased 
risk  of  thyroid  C-cell  tumors  in  rodents  and  are  contraindicated  in 
individuals  with  medullary  carcinoma  of  the  thyroid  or  multiple 
endocrine  neoplasia.  Because  GLP-1  receptor  agonists  slow  gastric 
emptying, they may influence the absorption of other drugs. Whether 
GLP-1 receptor agonists enhance beta cell survival or promote beta cell 
proliferation in humans as in rodents is not known, but these agents do 
not appear to alter the natural history of type 2 DM.

DPP-IV  inhibitors  inhibit  degradation  of  native  GLP-1  and  thus 
enhance the incretin effect. DPP-IV, which is widely expressed on the 
cell surface of endothelial cells and some lymphocytes, degrades a wide 
range  of  peptides  (not  GLP-1  specific).  DPP-IV  inhibitors  promote 
insulin  secretion  in  the  absence  of  hypoglycemia  or  weight  gain  and 
appear  to  have  a  preferential  effect  on  postprandial  blood  glucose. 
The levels of GLP-1 action in the patient are greater with the GLP-1 
receptor agonists than with DPP-IV inhibitors. DPP-IV inhibitors are 
used either alone or in combination with other oral agents in type 2 
DM.  Reduced  doses  should  be  given  to  patients  with  renal  insuffi-
ciency.  Allergy,  including  rash,  hypersensitivity  reactions  (including 
anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), and severe 
joint pain have been reported in association with DPP-IV inhibitors. 
There  is  evidence  concerning  a  potentially  increased  risk  for  acute 
pancreatitis  with  GLP-1  receptor  agonists  and  less  so  with  DPP-IV 
inhibitors.  For  now,  it  is  reasonable  to  avoid  these  agents  in  patients 
with pancreatic disease or with other significant risk factors for acute 
pancreatitis (e.g., heavy alcohol use, severely elevated serum triglycer-
ides, hypercalcemia).

α-GLUCOSIDASE  INHIBITORS  α-Glucosidase  inhibitors  reduce  post-
prandial  hyperglycemia  by  delaying  glucose  absorption;  they  do  not 
affect glucose utilization or insulin secretion (Table 404-5). Postpran-
dial  hyperglycemia,  secondary  to  impaired  hepatic  and  peripheral 
glucose disposal, contributes significantly to the hyperglycemic state in 
type 2 DM. These drugs, taken just before each meal, reduce glucose 
absorption by inhibiting the enzyme that cleaves oligosaccharides into 
simple sugars in the intestinal lumen. Therapy should be initiated at a 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   3111

3112 low dose with the evening meal and increased to a maximal dose over 
weeks to months. The major side effects (diarrhea, flatulence, abdom-
inal  distention)  are  related  to  increased  delivery  of  oligosaccharides 
to the large bowel and can be reduced somewhat by gradual upward 
dose  titration.  α-Glucosidase  inhibitors  may  increase  levels  of  sulfo-
nylureas  and  increase  the  incidence  of  hypoglycemia.  Simultaneous 
treatment with bile acid resins and antacids should be avoided. These 
agents  should  not  be  used  in  individuals  with  inflammatory  bowel 
disease, gastroparesis, or a serum creatinine >177 μmol/L (2 mg/dL). 
This class of agents is not as potent as other oral agents in lowering the 
HbA1c but is unique because it reduces the postprandial glucose rise. If 
hypoglycemia from other diabetes treatments occurs while taking these 
agents,  the  patient  should  consume  glucose  because  the  degradation 
and absorption of complex carbohydrates will be retarded.
THIAZOLIDINEDIONES  Thiazolidinediones  (Table  404-5)  reduce 
insulin resistance by binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor  γ  (PPAR-γ)  nuclear  receptor  (which  forms  a  heterodimer 
with the retinoid X receptor). The PPAR-γ receptor is found at high-
est levels in adipocytes but is expressed at lower levels in many other 
tissues.  Agonists  of  this  receptor  regulate  a  large  number  of  genes, 
promote  adipocyte  differentiation,  reduce  hepatic  fat  accumula-
tion,  and  promote  fatty  acid  storage.  Thiazolidinediones  promote  a 
redistribution of fat from central to peripheral locations. Circulating 
insulin  levels  decrease  with  use  of  the  thiazolidinediones,  indicat-
ing  a  reduction  in  insulin  resistance.  Although  direct  comparisons 
are  not  available,  the  two  currently  available  thiazolidinediones 
appear to have similar efficacy. The prototype of this class of drugs, 
troglitazone,  was  withdrawn  from  the  U.S.  market  after  reports  of 
hepatotoxicity and an association with an idiosyncratic liver reaction 
that  sometimes  led  to  hepatic  failure.  Although  rosiglitazone  and 
pioglitazone  do  not  appear  to  induce  the  liver  abnormalities  seen 
with troglitazone, the FDA recommends measurement of liver func-
tion tests prior to initiating therapy. Modestly increased transaminase 
levels  related  to  underlying  fatty  liver  disease  should  not  preclude 
treatment as these levels may improve with thiazolidinediones due to 
a reduction in hepatic fat content.

Rosiglitazone  raises  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL),  high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides slightly. Pioglitazone raises HDL 
to  a  greater  degree  and  LDL  a  lesser  degree  but  lowers  triglycerides. 
The clinical significance of the lipid changes with these agents is not 
known  and  may  be  difficult  to  ascertain  because  most  patients  with 
type 2 DM are also treated with a statin.

Thiazolidinediones are associated with weight gain (2–3 kg), a small 
reduction  in  the  hematocrit,  and  a  mild  increase  in  plasma  volume. 
Peripheral edema and CHF are more common in individuals treated 
with  these  agents.  These  agents  are  contraindicated  in  patients  with 
hepatic insufficiency or CHF (class III or IV). The FDA has issued an 
alert that rare patients taking these agents may experience a worsening 
of  diabetic  macular  edema.  An  increased  risk  of  fractures  has  been 
noted in postmenopausal women taking these agents. Thiazolidinedi-
ones have been shown to induce ovulation in premenopausal women 
with polycystic ovary syndrome. Women should be warned about the 
risk of pregnancy because the safety of thiazolidinediones in pregnancy 
is not established.

Concerns  about  increased  cardiovascular  risk  associated  with 
rosiglitazone led to considerable restrictions on its use and to the FDA 
issuing a black box warning in 2007. However, based on new informa-
tion, the FDA has revised its guidelines and categorizes rosiglitazone 
similar  to  other  drugs  for  type  2  DM.  According  to  an  FDA  review, 
pioglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of bladder can-
cer. In one study, pioglitazone lowered the risk for recurrent stroke or 
myocardial infarction in insulin-resistant individuals without diabetes 
who had a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors  These 
agents (Table 404-5) lower the blood glucose by selectively inhibiting 
this  co-transporter,  which  is  expressed  almost  exclusively  in  the 
proximal,  convoluted  tubule  in  the  kidney.  This  inhibits  glucose 
reabsorption,  lowers  the  renal  threshold  for  glucose,  and  leads  to 

increased urinary glucose excretion. Thus, the glucose-lowering effect 
is insulin independent and not related to changes in insulin sensitivity 
or secretion. The loss of urinary glucose may promote modest weight 
reduction.  Since  these  agents  also  impair  proximal  reabsorption  of 
sodium, their use is associated with a diuretic effect and 3–6 mmHg 
reduction  in  systolic  blood  pressure.  Due  to  the  increased  urinary 
glucose,  urinary  and  genital  mycotic  infections  are  more  common 
in both men and women, and the diuretic effect can lead to reduced 
intravascular volume and acutely impaired kidney function. Inhibition 
of SGLT2 may lead to increased glucagon and consequently liver pro-
duction  of  glucose  and  ketones.  Euglycemic  DKA  may  occur  during 
illness or when ongoing glucosuria masks stress-induced requirements 
for  insulin.  These  agents  should  not  be  prescribed  for  patients  with 
type  1  DM  or  pancreatogenic  forms  of  DM  associated  with  insulin 
deficiency.  Empagliflozin  or  canagliflozin  reduces  CVD  events  and 
all  cause  cardiovascular  mortality  in  patients  with  type  2  DM  and 
established  CVD.  All  SGLT2  inhibitors  may  reduce  hospitalization 
for CHF. Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have all been 
shown to reduce progression of diabetic kidney disease but should not 
be  initiated  in  patients  with  stage  3b  CKD  (eGFR  <45  mL/min  per 
1.73 m2) and should not be used with stage 4 CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min 
per 1.73 m2). A possible increased risk of bladder cancer has been seen 
with dapagliflozin.
OTHER  THERAPIES  FOR  TYPE  2  DM  •  Bile  Acid–Binding  Resins  
Evidence  indicates  that  bile  acids,  by  signaling  through  nuclear 
receptors,  may  have  a  role  in  metabolism.  Bile  acid  metabolism  is 
abnormal in type 2 DM. The bile acid–binding resin colesevelam has 
been approved for the treatment of type 2 DM (already approved for 
treatment  of  hypercholesterolemia).  Because  bile  acid–binding  resins 
are minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation, how bile acid–
binding resins lower blood glucose is not known. The most common 
side  effects  are  GI  (constipation,  abdominal  pain,  and  nausea).  Bile 
acid–binding  resins  can  increase  plasma  triglycerides  and  should  be 
used cautiously in patients with a tendency for hypertriglyceridemia. 
The role of this class of drugs in the treatment of type 2 DM is not yet 
defined.
Bromocriptine  A formulation of the dopamine receptor agonist brom-
ocriptine (Cycloset) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment 
of  type  2  DM.  However,  its  role  in  the  treatment  of  type  2  DM  is 
uncertain.
INSULIN THERAPY IN TYPE 2 DM  Insulin should be considered as part 
of  the  initial  therapy  in  type  2  DM,  particularly  in  lean  individuals 
or those with severe weight loss, in individuals with underlying renal 
or  hepatic  disease  that  precludes  oral  glucose-lowering  agents,  or  in 
individuals who are hospitalized or acutely ill. Insulin therapy is ulti-
mately required by a substantial number of individuals with type 2 DM 
because of the progressive nature of the disorder and the relative insu-
lin  deficiency  that  develops  in  patients  with  long-standing  diabetes. 
Both physician and patient reluctance often delay the initiation of insu-
lin  therapy,  but  glucose  control  and  patient  well-being  are  improved 
by insulin therapy in patients who have not reached glycemic targets.

Because  endogenous  insulin  secretion  continues  and  is  capable  of 
providing some coverage of mealtime caloric intake, insulin is usually 
initiated in a single dose of long-acting insulin (0.1–0.4 U/kg per day), 
given in the evening or just before bedtime (NPH, glargine, detemir, 
or  degludec).  Because  fasting  hyperglycemia  and  increased  hepatic 
glucose  production  are  prominent  features  of  type  2  DM,  bedtime 
insulin is more effective in clinical trials than a single dose of morning 
insulin.  Glargine  given  at  bedtime  has  less  nocturnal  hypoglycemia 
than NPH insulin. Some physicians prefer a relatively low, fixed start-
ing dose of long-acting insulin (5–15 units) or a weight-based dose (0.1 
units/kg).  The  insulin  dose  may  then  be  adjusted  in  10–20%  incre-
ments as dictated by SMBG results. Both morning and bedtime long- 
acting insulin may be used in combination with oral glucose-lowering 
agents.  Initially,  basal  insulin  may  be  sufficient,  but  often  prandial 
insulin coverage with multiple insulin injections is needed as diabetes 
progresses  (see  insulin  regimens  used  for  type  1  DM).  Other  insulin 
formulations that have a combination of short-acting and long-acting

insulin (Table 404-4) are sometimes used in patients with type 2 DM 
because  of  convenience  but  do  not  allow  independent  adjustment  of 
short-acting and long-acting insulin dose and often do not achieve the 
same degree of glycemic control as basal/bolus regimens. In selected 
patients with insulin-deficient type 2 DM, insulin infusion devices may 
be considered.

CHOICE OF INITIAL GLUCOSE-LOWERING AGENT  The level of hyper-
glycemia  and  the  patient’s  individualized  goal  (see  “Establishment  of 
Target Level of Glycemic Control”) should influence the initial choice 
of therapy. Patients with mild hyperglycemia (FPG <7.0–11.0 mmol/L 
[126–199 mg/dL]) often respond well to a single, oral glucose-lowering 
agent, while those with moderate hyperglycemia (FPG 11.1–13.9 mmol/L 
[200–250  mg/dL])  will  usually  require  more  than  one  oral  agent  or 
insulin. Patients with more severe hyperglycemia (FPG >13.9 mmol/L 
[250 mg/dL]) may respond partially but are unlikely to achieve nor-
moglycemia with oral therapy. Insulin can be used as initial therapy 
in  individuals  with  severe  hyperglycemia  (FPG  <13.9–16.7  mmol/L 
[250–300 mg/dL]) or in those who are symptomatic from the hyper-
glycemia. This approach is based on the rationale that more rapid gly-
cemic control will reduce “glucose toxicity” to the islet cells, improve 
endogenous  insulin  secretion,  and  possibly  allow  oral  glucose- 
lowering  agents  to  be  more  effective.  If  this  occurs,  the  insulin  may 
be discontinued.

Insulin secretagogues, biguanides, α-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazo-
lidinediones,  GLP-1  receptor  agonists,  DPP-IV  inhibitors,  SLGT2 
inhibitors,  and  insulin  are  approved  for  monotherapy  of  type  2  DM. 
Although each class of oral glucose-lowering agents has advantages and 
disadvantages (Table 404-5), certain generalizations apply: (1) insulin 
secretagogues,  biguanides,  GLP-1  receptor  agonists,  and  thiazolidin-
ediones  improve  glycemic  control  to  a  similar  degree  (1–2%  reduc-
tion  in  HbA1c)  and  are  more  effective  than  α-glucosidase  inhibitors, 
DPP-IV  inhibitors,  and  SLGT2  inhibitors;  (2)  insulin  secretagogues, 
GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, 
and SLGT2 inhibitors begin to lower the plasma glucose immediately, 
whereas  the  glucose-lowering  effects  of  the  biguanides  and  thiazoli-
dinediones are delayed by weeks; (3) not all agents are effective in all 
individuals with type 2 DM; (4) biguanides, α-glucosidase inhibitors, 
GLP-1  receptor  agonists,  DPP-IV  inhibitors,  thiazolidinediones,  and 
SLGT2 inhibitors do not directly cause hypoglycemia; (5) most indi-
viduals  will  eventually  require  treatment  with  more  than  one  class 
of  oral  glucose-lowering  agents  or  insulin,  reflecting  the  progressive 
nature of type 2 DM; and (6) durability of glycemic control is slightly 
less for sulfonylureas compared to metformin or thiazolidinediones.

Considerable  clinical  experience  exists  with  metformin  and  sul-
fonylureas  because  they  have  been  available  for  several  decades.  It  is 
assumed  that  the  α-glucosidase  inhibitors,  GLP-1  receptor  agonists, 
DPP-IV  inhibitors,  thiazolidinediones,  and  SLGT2  inhibitors  will 
reduce  DM-related  complications  by  improving  glycemic  control. 
Pioglitazone may reduce CVD events through targeting a fundamental 
abnormality in type 2 DM, namely insulin resistance. A reduction in 
CVD  events  and  in  progression  of  diabetic  kidney  disease  seen  with 
some GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors may also operate through 
glucose-independent mechanisms (Chap. 405).

Treatment  algorithms  by  several  professional  societies  (ADA/
European Association for the Study of Diabetes [EASD], IDF, AACE) 
suggest  metformin  as  initial  therapy  because  of  its  efficacy,  known 
side-effect  profile,  and  low  cost  (Fig.  404-3).  Initiation  of  pharma-
cologic  therapy  should  be  accompanied  by  an  emphasis  on  lifestyle 
modification (e.g., MNT, increased physical activity, and weight loss). 
Metformin’s advantages are that it promotes mild weight loss, lowers 
insulin levels, and improves the lipid profile slightly. Based on SMBG 
results and the HbA1c, the dose of metformin should be increased until 
the glycemic target is achieved or maximum dose is reached.

COMBINATION  THERAPY  WITH  GLUCOSE-LOWERING  AGENTS  A 
number  of  combinations  of  therapeutic  agents  are  successful  in  type 
2 DM: metformin + second oral agent, metformin + GLP-1 receptor 
agonist, metformin + insulin, or combinations of a long-acting insulin 
and  a  GLP-1  receptor  agonist.  Because  mechanisms  of  action  of  the

FIGURE  404-3  Glycemic  management  of  type  2  diabetes.  See  text  for  discussion

first  and  second  agents  should  be  different,  the  effect  on  glycemic 
control is usually additive. There are little data to support the choice 
of  one  combination  over  another  combination.  Recent  results  from 
the  NIH-funded  Glycemia  Reduction  Approaches  in  Diabetes:  A 
Comparative  Effectiveness  Study  (GRADE)  indicated  that  addition 
of  liraglutide  or  basal  insulin  to  metformin  leads  to  better  glycemic 
control  than  glimepiride  or  sitagliptin  (SLGT2  inhibitors  were  not 
studied). Based on recent demonstrations of a beneficial cardiovascular 
effect in certain individuals with type 2 DM and CVD, or at high risk 
of CVD, a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a SGLT2 inhibitor should now be 
considered  in  these  populations.  Medication  costs  vary  considerably 
(Table  404-5),  and  this  often  factors  into  medication  choice.  Several 
fixed-dose combinations of oral agents are available, but evidence that 
they are superior to titration of a single agent to a maximum dose and 
then addition of a second agent is lacking. If adequate control is not 
achieved with the combination of two agents (based on reassessment of 
the HbA1c every 3 months), a third oral agent, GLP-1 receptor agonist, 
or  basal  insulin  should  be  added  (Fig.  404-3).  Treatment  approaches 
vary considerably from country to country. For example, α-glucosidase 
inhibitors  are  used  commonly  in  South  Asian  patients  (Indian),  but 
infrequently in the United States or Europe. Whether this reflects an 
underlying difference in the disease or physician preference is not clear.
Treatment  with  insulin  often  becomes  necessary  as  type  2  DM 
enters the phase of relative insulin deficiency and is signaled by inad-
equate glycemic control with one or two oral glucose-lowering agents. 
Insulin  alone  or  in  combination  should  be  used  in  patients  who  fail 
to  reach  glycemic  targets.  For  example,  a  single  dose  of  long-acting 
insulin  at  bedtime  is  often  effective  in  combination  with  metformin. 
As endogenous insulin production falls further, multiple injections of 
long-acting together with short-acting insulin are necessary to control 
postprandial glucose excursions. These insulin regimens are identical 
to  the  long-acting  and  short-acting  combination  regimens  discussed 
above  for  type  1  DM,  although  usually  at  higher  doses  given  insulin 
resistance. Weight gain and hypoglycemia are the major adverse effects

3114 of insulin therapy. The daily insulin dose required can become quite 
large (1–2 units/kg per day) as endogenous insulin production falls and 
insulin resistance persists. Individuals who require >1 unit/kg per day 
of  long-acting  insulin  should  be  considered  for  combination  therapy 
with  metformin  a  GLP-1  receptor  agonist,  or  a  thiazolidinedione  as 
these can reduce insulin requirements in some individuals with type 
2 DM. Insulin plus a thiazolidinedione promotes weight gain and may 
be associated with peripheral edema. Addition of a thiazolidinedione 
to a patient’s insulin regimen may necessitate a reduction in the insulin 
dose to avoid hypoglycemia. Patients requiring large doses of insulin 
(>200  units/day)  can  be  treated  with  a  more  concentrated  form  of 
insulin.

 ■ OTHER THERAPIES FOR DIABETES
Metabolic (also referred to as bariatric) surgery for obese individuals 
with  type  2  DM  has  shown  considerable  promise,  sometimes  with 
dramatic resolution of the diabetes or major reductions in the needed 
dose of glucose-lowering therapies (Chap. 402). Several large, nonran-
domized  clinical  trials  have  demonstrated  a  much  greater  efficacy  of 
metabolic surgery compared to medical management in the treatment 
of type 2 DM and may be considered in individuals with type 2 DM 
and a BMI >35 kg/m2. The ADA clinical guidelines state that metabolic 
surgery  should  be  considered  in  individuals  with  type  2  DM  and  a 
body mass index >30 kg/m2 if hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled 
despite optimal medical therapy.

Short-term  intense  caloric  restriction  (very-low-calorie  diet,  typ-
ically  800–1000  calories/day)  can  dramatically  improve  type  2  DM, 
sometimes leading to resolution of the diabetes. Such an approach is 
more  effective  in  recent-onset  type  2  DM  and  should  be  supervised 
by a provider with expertise and should be followed by a long-term, 
weight-maintenance program.

Whole-pancreas  transplantation  can  normalize  glucose  control  in 
type  1  DM  and  when  performed  simultaneously  with  or  after  kid-
ney  transplantation  can  prolong  the  life  of  the  kidney  transplant  by 
offering protection against recurrent diabetic nephropathy. Pancreatic 
islet  transplantation  is  available  as  a  less  invasive  form  of  beta-cell 
replacement therapy for type 1 DM, but it remains investigational in 
the United States. Due to the risks associated with chronic immuno-
suppression,  whole-pancreas  and  pancreatic  islet  transplantation  may 
be  considered  for  patients  with  severe  metabolic  instability  or  already 
requiring  immunosuppression  in  support  of  a  kidney  or  other  organ 
transplant. Patients with chronic pancreatitis and preserved islet function 
who require pancreatectomy for pain relief may benefit from autologous 
islet transplantation as this may prevent or ameliorate postsurgical DM.

 ■ EMERGING THERAPIES
Many  individuals  with  long-standing  type  1  DM  still  produce  very 
small  amounts  of  insulin  or  have  insulin-positive  cells  within  the 
pancreas. This suggests that beta cells may slowly regenerate but are 
quickly  destroyed  by  the  autoimmune  process.  Particularly  early  in 
the  disease  course,  efforts  to  suppress  the  autoimmune  process,  for 
example with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies that target T lympho-
cytes, are being tested at the time of diagnosis of type 1 DM, and for 
prevention  in  autoantibody-positive  individuals  at  stages  1  and  2  of 
type  1  DM  (Chap.  403).  Agents  that  target  thioredoxin-interacting 
protein (TXNIP), especially Ca++ channel blockers, have some prom-
ise in recent-onset T1D and in rodent models of diabetes. Closed-loop 
insulin infusion devices that automate insulin delivery in response to 
changing glucose levels are progressing rapidly. New therapies under 
evaluation  or  development  for  type  2  DM  include  activators  of  glu-
cokinase,  inhibitors  of  11  β-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase-1,  GPR40 
agonists, dual agonists targeting the glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
polypeptide  receptor  and  the  GLP1-receptor,  combined  SLGT1  and 
SLGT2 inhibitors, and agents that may reduce inflammation, for exam-
ple by inhibiting IL-1β.

Because  whole-pancreas  and  pancreatic  islet  transplantation  are 
both  limited  by  organ  availability  from  deceased  donors,  stem  cell–
derived islet cells and xenogeneic sources of islets may eventually allow 
for a limitless supply of insulin-producing cells for transplantation.

ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THERAPY FOR DM
As with any therapy, the benefits of efforts directed toward glycemic 
control must be balanced against the risks of treatment (Table 404-5). 
Side  effects  of  intensive  treatment  include  an  increased  frequency  of 
serious  hypoglycemia,  weight  gain,  increased  economic  costs,  and 
greater demands on the patient. In the DCCT, quality of life was very 
similar in the intensive and standard therapy groups. The most serious 
complication  of  therapy  for  DM  is  hypoglycemia,  and  its  treatment 
with  oral  glucose  or  glucagon  injection  is  discussed  in  Chap.  406. 
Severe, recurrent, or unexplained hypoglycemia warrants examination 
of  treatment  regimen  and  glycemic  goal  for  the  individual  patient. 
Weight gain occurs with most (insulin, insulin secretagogues, thiazo-
lidinediones) but not all (metformin, α-glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 
receptor  agonists,  DPP-IV  inhibitors)  therapies.  The  weight  gain  is 
partially  due  to  the  anabolic  effects  of  insulin  and  the  reduction  in 
glucosuria.

ACUTE DISORDERS RELATED TO  
SEVERE HYPERGLYCEMIA
Individuals  with  type  1  or  type  2  DM  and  severe  hyperglycemia 
(>13.9 mmol/L [250 mg/dL]) should be assessed for clinical stability, 
including  mentation  and  hydration.  Depending  on  the  patient  and 
the  rapidity  and  duration  of  the  severe  hyperglycemia,  an  individual 
may  require  more  intense  and  rapid  therapy  to  lower  the  blood  glu-
cose.  However,  many  patients  with  poorly  controlled  diabetes  and 
hyperglycemia  have  few  symptoms.  The  physician  should  assess  if 
the patient is stable or if DKA or a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state 
(HHS) should be considered. Ketones, an indicator of DKA, should be 
measured in individuals with type 1 DM when the plasma glucose is 
persistently  >13.9  mmol/L  (250  mg/dL),  during  a  concurrent  illness, 
or with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Blood 
measurement of β-hydroxybutyrate is preferred over urine testing with 
nitroprusside-based assays that measure only acetoacetate and acetone.
DKA and HHS are acute, severe disorders directly related to diabe-
tes. DKA was formerly considered a hallmark of type 1 DM, but it also 
occurs in individuals with type 2 DM who can sometimes subsequently 
be treated with oral glucose-lowering agents (frequently in individuals 
of Hispanic or African-American descent). HHS is primarily seen in 
individuals with type 2 DM. Both disorders are associated with abso-
lute  or  relative  insulin  deficiency,  volume  depletion,  and  acid–base 
abnormalities. DKA and HHS exist along a continuum of hyperglyce-
mia, with or without ketosis. The metabolic similarities and differences 
in DKA and HHS are highlighted in Table 404-6. Both disorders are 
associated with potentially serious complications if not promptly diag-
nosed and carefully treated.
 ■ DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS
Clinical  Features  The  symptoms  and  physical  signs  of  DKA  are 
listed in Table 404-7 and usually develop over 24 h. DKA may be the 
initial symptom complex that leads to a diagnosis of type 1 DM, but 
more  frequently,  it  occurs  in  individuals  with  established  diabetes. 
Nausea  and  vomiting  are  often  prominent,  and  their  presence  in  an 
individual  with  diabetes  warrants  laboratory  evaluation  for  DKA. 
Abdominal pain may be severe and can resemble acute pancreatitis or 
ruptured viscus. Hyperglycemia leads to glucosuria, volume depletion, 
and tachycardia. Hypotension can occur because of volume depletion 
in combination with peripheral vasodilatation. Kussmaul respirations 
and a fruity odor on the patient’s breath (secondary to metabolic aci-
dosis and increased acetone) are classic signs of the disorder. Lethargy 
and  central  nervous  system  depression  may  evolve  into  coma  with 
severe  DKA  but  should  also  prompt  evaluation  for  other  reasons  for 
altered mental status (e.g., infection, hypoxemia). Cerebral edema, an 
extremely  serious  complication  of  DKA,  is  seen  most  frequently  in 
children.  Signs  of  infection,  which  may  precipitate  DKA,  should  be 
sought on physical examination, even in the absence of fever. Failure 
to augment insulin therapy during physiologic stress often compounds 
the problem. Tissue ischemia (heart, brain) can also be a precipitating 
factor. Omission of insulin because of an infusion pump delivery site

occlusion  or  device  malfunction,  eating  disorder,  mental  health  dis-
orders, or an unstable psychosocial environment may sometimes be a 
factor precipitating DKA. Complete omission or inadequate adminis-
tration of insulin by the patient or health care team (in a hospitalized 
patient with type 1 DM) may precipitate DKA.

Pathophysiology  DKA  results  from  relative  or  absolute  insulin 
deficiency  combined  with  counterregulatory  hormone  excess  (glu-
cagon,  catecholamines,  cortisol,  and  growth  hormone).  Both  insulin 
deficiency and glucagon excess, in particular, are necessary for DKA to 
develop. The decreased ratio of insulin to glucagon promotes glucone-
ogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketone body formation in the liver, as well 
as increases in substrate delivery from fat and muscle (free fatty acids, 
amino acids) to the liver. Ketosis results from a marked increase in free 
fatty acid release from adipocytes, with a resulting shift toward ketone 
body  synthesis  in  the  liver.  Reduced  insulin  levels,  in  combination 
with elevations in catecholamines and growth hormone, also increase 
lipolysis  and  the  release  of  free  fatty  acids.  Markers  of  inflammation 
(cytokines, C-reactive protein) are elevated in both DKA and HHS.

Laboratory  Abnormalities  and  Diagnosis  The  timely  diag-
nosis  of  DKA  is  crucial  and  allows  for  prompt  initiation  of  therapy. 
DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia (serum glucose >13.9 mmol/L 
[250  mg/dL],  ketosis,  and  metabolic  acidosis  [serum  bicarbonate 
<15–18 mmol/L with increased anion gap]) along with a number of 
secondary  metabolic  derangements  (Table  404-6).  Occasionally,  the 
serum  glucose  is  only  minimally  elevated  and  may  even  be  normal

(euglycemic  DKA).  This  has  been  noted  especially  in  individuals 
treated  with  SGLT2  inhibitors.  Arterial  pH  usually  ranges  between 
6.8 and 7.3, depending on the severity of the acidosis. Despite a total-
body  potassium  deficit,  the  serum  potassium  at  presentation  may 
be mildly elevated, secondary to the acidosis and volume depletion. 
Total-body stores of sodium, chloride, phosphorus, and magnesium 
are  also  reduced  in  DKA  but  are  not  accurately  reflected  by  their 
levels in the serum because of hypovolemia and hyperglycemia. Ele-
vated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels reflect 
intravascular volume depletion. Leukocytosis, hypertriglyceridemia, 
and hyperlipoproteinemia are commonly found as well. Hyperamy-
lasemia  may  suggest  a  diagnosis  of  pancreatitis,  especially  when 
accompanied  by  abdominal  pain.  However,  in  DKA  the  amylase  is 
usually  of  salivary  origin  and  thus  is  not  diagnostic  of  pancreatitis. 
Serum lipase should be obtained if pancreatitis is suspected.

The  measured  serum  sodium  is  reduced  as  a  consequence  of  the 
hyperglycemia (1.6-mmol/L [1.6-meq] reduction in serum sodium for 
each  5.6-mmol/L  [100-mg/dL]  rise  in  the  serum  glucose).  A  normal 
serum sodium in the setting of DKA indicates a more profound water 
deficit.

In  DKA,  the  ketone  body,  β-hydroxybutyrate,  is  synthesized  at 
a  threefold  greater  rate  than  acetoacetate;  however,  acetoacetate  is 
preferentially detected by a commonly used ketosis detection reagent 
(nitroprusside). Serum ketones are present at significant levels (usually 
positive at serum dilution of ≥1:8). The nitroprusside tablet, or stick, 
is often used to detect urine ketones; certain medications such as cap-
topril  or  penicillamine  may  cause  false-positive  reactions.  Serum  or 
plasma assays for β-hydroxybutyrate are preferred because they more 
accurately reflect the true ketone body level.

The  metabolic  derangements  of  DKA  exist  along  a  spectrum, 
beginning with mild acidosis with moderate hyperglycemia evolv-
ing  into  more  severe  findings.  The  degree  of  acidosis  and  hyper-
glycemia  do  not  necessarily  correlate  closely  because  a  variety  of 
factors  determine  the  level  of  hyperglycemia  (oral  intake,  urinary 
glucose  loss).  Ketonemia  is  a  consistent  finding  in  DKA  and  dis-
tinguishes it from simple hyperglycemia. The differential diagnosis 
of  DKA  includes  starvation  ketosis,  alcoholic  ketoacidosis  (bicar-
bonate usually >15 meq/L), and other forms of increased anion-gap 
acidosis (Chap. 55).

1. Confirm diagnosis (↑ serum glucose, ↑ serum β-hydroxybutyrate, metabolic 

acidosis).

2. Admit to hospital; intensive care setting may be necessary for frequent 
monitoring, if pH <7.00, labored respiration, or impaired level of arousal.

3. Assess:

Serum electrolytes (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cl–, bicarbonate, phosphate)
Acid-base status—pH, HCO3
Renal function (creatinine, urine output)

–, PCO2, β-hydroxybutyrate

4. Replace fluids: 2–3 L of 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer’s over first 1–3 h  

(10–20 mL/kg per hour); subsequently, 0.45% saline at 250–500 mL/h; change 
to 5% glucose and 0.45% saline or lactated Ringer’s at 150–250 mL/h when 
blood glucose reaches 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L).

5. Administer short-acting regular insulin: IV (0.1 units/kg), then 0.1 units/kg 

per hour by continuous IV infusion; increase two- to threefold if no response 
by 2–4 h. If the initial serum potassium is <3.3 mmol/L (3.3 meq/L), do not 
administer insulin until the potassium is corrected. Subcutaneous insulin may 
be used in uncomplicated, mild-moderate DKA with close monitoring.
6. Assess patient: What precipitated the episode (noncompliance, infection, 
trauma, pregnancy, infarction, cocaine)? Initiate appropriate workup for 
precipitating event (cultures, CXR, ECG, etc.).

7. Measure blood glucose every 1–2 h; measure electrolytes (especially K+, 

bicarbonate, phosphate) and anion gap every 4 h for first 24 h.

8. Monitor blood pressure, pulse, respirations, mental status, fluid intake and 

output every 1–4 h.

9. Replace K+: 10 meq/h when plasma K+ <5.0–5.2 meq/L (or 20–30 meq/L of 

infusion fluid), ECG normal, urine flow and normal creatinine documented; 
administer 40–80 meq/h when plasma K+ <3.5 meq/L or if bicarbonate is given. 
If initial serum potassium is >5.2 mmol/L (5.2 meq/L), do not supplement K+ 
until the potassium is corrected.

10. See text about bicarbonate or phosphate supplementation.
11. Continue above until patient is stable, glucose goal is 8.3–11.1 mmol/L 

(150–200 mg/dL), and acidosis is resolved. Insulin infusion may be decreased 
to 0.02–0.1 units/kg per hour.

12. Administer long-acting insulin as soon as patient is eating. Allow for a 2- to 

4-h overlap in insulin infusion and SC long-acting insulin injection.

event that precipitated the episode of DKA should be sought and 
aggressively treated. If the patient is vomiting or has altered mental 
status, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to prevent aspiration of 
gastric contents. Central to successful treatment of DKA is careful 
monitoring  and  frequent  reassessment  to  ensure  that  the  patient 
and the metabolic derangements are improving. A comprehensive 
flow  sheet  should  record  chronologic  changes  in  vital  signs,  fluid 
intake  and  output,  and  laboratory  values  as  a  function  of  insulin 
administered.

After  the  initial  bolus  of  normal  saline  or  lactated  Ringer’s, 
replacement of the sodium and free water deficit is carried out over 
the  next  24  h  (fluid  deficit  is  often  3–5  L).  When  hemodynamic 
stability and adequate urine output are achieved, IV fluids should 
be switched to 0.45% saline or lactated Ringer’s depending on the 
calculated volume deficit. The change to 0.45% saline or using lac-
tated Ringer’s helps to reduce the trend toward hyperchloremia later 
in the course of DKA.

A  bolus  of  IV  (0.1  units/kg)  short-acting  regular  insulin  is 
usually  administered  immediately  (Table  404-8),  and  subsequent 
treatment  should  provide  continuous  and  adequate  levels  of  cir-
culating insulin. IV administration is usually preferred (0.1 units/
kg of regular insulin per h) in patients with severe or complicated 
DKA because it ensures rapid distribution and allows adjustment of 
the infusion rate as the patient responds to therapy. Mild to mod-
erate uncomplicated DKA can also be treated with SC short-acting 
insulin analogues. If chosen, IV regular insulin should be continued 
until  the  acidosis  resolves  and  the  patient  is  metabolically  stable. 
As the acidosis and insulin resistance associated with DKA resolve, 

the  insulin  infusion  rate  can  be  decreased  (to  0.02–0.1  units/kg 
per  h).  Long-acting  insulin,  in  combination  with  SC  short-acting 
insulin,  should  be  administered  as  soon  as  the  patient  resumes 
eating,  because  this  facilitates  transition  to  an  outpatient  insulin 
regimen and reduces length of hospital stay. It is crucial to continue 
the insulin infusion or insulin SC until adequate insulin levels are 
achieved by administering long-acting insulin by the SC route. Even 
relatively brief periods of inadequate insulin administration in this 
transition  phase  may  result  in  DKA  relapse.  In  euglycemic  DKA 
associated  with  SGLT2  inhibitors,  the  pharmacologic  effect  may 
persist for 10–14 days following discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitor 
therapy as evidenced by ongoing glucosuria despite normoglycemia 
(glucose <180 mg/dL), during which time relapse of ketoacidosis is 
common if nutritional intake has not advanced (e.g., in the postop-
erative setting).

Hyperglycemia  usually  improves  at  a  rate  of  4.2–5.6  mmol/L 
(50–100  mg/dL)  per  h  as  a  result  of  insulin-mediated  glucose 
disposal,  reduced  hepatic  glucose  release,  and  rehydration.  Rehy-
dration reduces catecholamines, increases urinary glucose loss, and 
expands the intravascular volume. The decline in the plasma glu-
cose within the first 1–2 h may be more rapid and is mostly related 
to  volume  expansion.  When  the  plasma  glucose  reaches  11.1– 
13.9  mmol/L  (200–250  mg/dL),  glucose  should  be  added  to  the 
0.45%  saline  infusion  to  maintain  the  plasma  glucose  in  the   
8.3–11.1 mmol/L (150–200 mg/dL) range, and the insulin infusion 
should  be  continued  at  a  lower  rate  to  inhibit  ketogenesis.  More 
rapid correction of the serum glucose can precipitate the develop-
ment  of  cerebral  edema.  Ketoacidosis  begins  to  resolve  as  insulin 
reduces lipolysis, increases peripheral ketone body use, suppresses 
hepatic ketone body formation, and promotes bicarbonate regener-
ation. However, the acidosis and ketosis resolve more slowly than 
hyperglycemia. Depending on the rise of serum chloride, the anion 
gap  (but  not  bicarbonate)  will  normalize.  A  hyperchloremic  aci-
dosis (serum bicarbonate of 15–18 mmol/L [15–18 meq/L]) often 
follows successful treatment and gradually resolves as the kidneys 
regenerate bicarbonate and excrete chloride.

Potassium  stores  are  depleted  in  DKA  (estimated  deficit   

3–5  mmol/kg  [3–5  meq/kg]).  During  treatment  with  insulin  and 
fluids,  various  factors  contribute  to  the  development  of  hypoka-
lemia.  These  include  insulin-mediated  potassium  transport  into 
cells,  resolution  of  the  acidosis  (which  also  promotes  potassium 
entry into cells), and urinary loss of potassium salts of organic acids. 
Thus, potassium repletion should commence as soon as adequate 
urine  output  and  a  normal  serum  potassium  are  documented.  If 
the initial serum potassium level is elevated, then potassium reple-
tion  should  be  delayed  until  the  potassium  falls  into  the  normal 
range.  Inclusion  of  20–40  meq  of  potassium  in  each  liter  of  IV 
fluid  is  reasonable,  but  additional  potassium  supplements  may 
also be required. To reduce the amount of chloride administered, 
potassium phosphate or acetate can be substituted for the chloride 
salt. The goal is to maintain the serum potassium at >3.5 mmol/L  
(3.5 meq/L).

Despite  a  bicarbonate  deficit,  bicarbonate  replacement  is  not 
usually necessary. In fact, theoretical arguments suggest that bicar-
bonate  administration  and  rapid  reversal  of  acidosis  may  impair 
cardiac function, reduce tissue oxygenation, and promote hypoka-
lemia. The results of most clinical trials do not support the routine 
use  of  bicarbonate  replacement,  and  one  study  in  children  found 
that bicarbonate use was associated with an increased risk of cere-
bral  edema.  However,  in  the  presence  of  severe  acidosis  (arterial 
pH  <7.0),  sodium  bicarbonate  (50  mmol  [meq/L]  in  200  mL  of 
sterile water with 10 meq/L KCl per h) may be administered for the 
first 2 h until the pH is >7.0. Hypophosphatemia may result from 
increased  glucose  usage,  but  randomized  clinical  trials  have  not 
demonstrated that phosphate replacement is beneficial in DKA. If 
the serum phosphate is <0.32 mmol/L (1 mg/dL), then phosphate 
supplement  should  be  considered  and  the  serum  calcium  moni-
tored.  Hypomagnesemia  may  develop  during  DKA  therapy  and 
may also require supplementation.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismWith appropriate therapy, the mortality rate of DKA is low (<1%) 
and is related more to the underlying or precipitating event, such 
as  infection  or  myocardial  infarction.  Venous  thrombosis,  upper 
GI bleeding, and acute respiratory distress syndrome occasionally 
complicate  DKA.  The  major  nonmetabolic  complication  of  DKA 
therapy is cerebral edema, which most often develops in children as 
DKA is resolving. The etiology of and optimal therapy for cerebral 
edema are not well established, but overreplacement of free water 
and rapid normalization of serum glucose should be avoided.

Following treatment, the physician and patient should review the 
sequence of events that led to DKA to prevent future recurrences. 
Foremost  is  patient  education  about  the  symptoms  of  DKA,  its 
precipitating  factors,  and  the  management  of  diabetes  during  a 
concurrent illness.

 ■ HYPERGLYCEMIC HYPEROSMOLAR STATE
Clinical  Features  The  prototypical  patient  with  HHS  is  an  elderly 
individual with type 2 DM, with a several-week history of polyuria, weight 
loss,  and  diminished  oral  intake  that  culminates  in  mental  confusion, 
lethargy,  or  coma.  The  physical  examination  reflects  profound  dehy-
dration  and  hyperosmolality  and  reveals  hypotension,  tachycardia,  and 
altered mental status. Notably absent are symptoms of nausea, vomiting, 
and abdominal pain and the Kussmaul respirations characteristic of DKA. 
HHS is often precipitated by a serious, concurrent illness such as myocar-
dial infarction or stroke. Sepsis, pneumonia, and other serious infections 
are frequent precipitants and should be sought. In addition, a debilitating 
condition (prior stroke or dementia) or social situation that compromises 
water intake usually contributes to the development of the disorder.

Pathophysiology  Relative insulin deficiency and inadequate fluid 
intake are the underlying causes of HHS. Insulin deficiency increases 
hepatic glucose production (through glycogenolysis and gluconeogen-
esis) and impairs glucose utilization in skeletal muscle (see above dis-
cussion of DKA). Hyperglycemia induces an osmotic diuresis that leads 
to intravascular volume depletion, which is exacerbated by inadequate 
fluid replacement. The absence of ketosis in HHS is not understood. 
Presumably, the insulin deficiency is only relative and less severe than 
in  DKA.  Lower  levels  of  counterregulatory  hormones  and  free  fatty 
acids have been found in HHS than in DKA in some studies. It is also 
possible that the liver is less capable of ketone body synthesis or that 
the insulin/glucagon ratio does not favor ketogenesis.

Laboratory  Abnormalities  and  Diagnosis  The  laboratory  
features  in  HHS  are  summarized  in  Table  404-6.  Most  notable  are 
the  marked  hyperglycemia  (plasma  glucose  may  be  >55.5  mmol/L  
[1000  mg/dL]),  hyperosmolality  (>350  mOsm/L),  and  prerenal 
azotemia.  The  measured  serum  sodium  may  be  normal  or  slightly 
low despite the marked hyperglycemia. The corrected serum sodium 
is  usually  increased  (add  1.6  meq  to  measured  sodium  for  each 
5.6-mmol/L  [100-mg/dL]  rise  in  the  serum  glucose).  In  contrast  to 
DKA, acidosis and ketonemia are absent or mild. A small anion-gap 
metabolic acidosis may be present secondary to increased lactic acid. 
Moderate ketonuria, if present, is secondary to starvation.

TREATMENT
Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State

Volume  depletion  and  hyperglycemia  are  prominent  features  of 
both  HHS  and  DKA.  Consequently,  therapy  of  these  disorders 
shares  several  elements  (Table  404-8).  In  both  disorders,  careful 
monitoring of the patient’s fluid status, laboratory values, and insu-
lin  infusion  rate  is  crucial.  Underlying  or  precipitating  problems 
should  be  aggressively  sought  and  treated.  In  HHS,  fluid  losses 
and dehydration are usually more pronounced than in DKA due to 
the longer duration of the illness. The patient with HHS is usually 
older,  more  likely  to  have  mental  status  changes,  and  more  likely 
to  have  a  life-threatening  precipitating  event  with  accompanying 

comorbidities. Even with proper treatment, HHS has a substantially 
higher mortality rate than DKA (up to 15% in some clinical series).
Fluid  replacement  should  initially  stabilize  the  hemodynamic 
status  of  the  patient  (1–3  L  of  0.9%  normal  saline  over  the  first   
2–3  h).  Because  the  fluid  deficit  in  HHS  is  accumulated  over  a 
period of days to weeks, the rapidity of reversal of the hyperosmolar 
state  must  balance  the  need  for  free  water  repletion  with  the  risk 
that  too  rapid  a  reversal  may  worsen  neurologic  function.  If  the 
serum sodium is >150 mmol/L (150 meq/L), 0.45% saline should 
be  used.  After  hemodynamic  stability  is  achieved,  the  IV  fluid 
administration is directed at reversing the free water deficit using 
hypotonic fluids (0.45% saline initially, then 5% dextrose in water 
[D5W]). The calculated free water deficit (which can be as great as 
9–10 L) should be reversed over the next 1–2 days (infusion rates 
of  200–300  mL/h  of  hypotonic  solution).  Potassium  repletion  is 
usually necessary and should be dictated by repeated measurements 
of the serum potassium. In patients taking diuretics, the potassium 
deficit can be quite large and may be accompanied by magnesium 
deficiency. Hypophosphatemia may occur during therapy and can 
be improved by using KPO4 and beginning nutrition.

As in DKA, rehydration and volume expansion lower the plasma 
glucose initially, but insulin is also required. A reasonable regimen 
for HHS begins with an IV insulin bolus of 0.1 unit/kg followed by 
IV insulin at a constant infusion rate of 0.1 unit/kg per hour. If the 
serum  glucose  does  not  fall,  increase  the  insulin  infusion  rate  by 
twofold. As in DKA, glucose should be added to IV fluid when the 
plasma glucose falls to 11.1–13.9 mmol/L (200–250 mg/dL), and the 
insulin  infusion  rate  should  be  decreased  to  0.02–0.1  unit/kg  per 
h.  The  insulin  infusion  should  be  continued  until  the  patient  has 
resumed eating and can be transferred to an SC insulin regimen. The 
patient should be discharged from the hospital on insulin, although 
some patients can later switch to oral glucose-lowering agents.

MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES IN A 
HOSPITALIZED PATIENT
Virtually  all  medical  and  surgical  subspecialties  are  involved  in  the 
care of hospitalized patients with diabetes. Hyperglycemia, whether in 
a patient with known diabetes or in someone without known diabetes, 
appears  to  be  a  predictor  of  poor  outcome  in  hospitalized  patients. 
General anesthesia, surgery, infection, or concurrent illness raises the 
levels of counterregulatory hormones (cortisol, growth hormone, cat-
echolamines, and glucagon) and cytokines that may lead to transient 
insulin  resistance  and  hyperglycemia.  These  factors  increase  insulin 
requirements by increasing glucose production and impairing glucose 
utilization  and  thus  may  worsen  glycemic  control.  The  concurrent 
illness  or  surgical  procedure  may  lead  to  variable  insulin  absorption 
and also prevent the patient with DM from eating normally and, thus, 
may promote hypoglycemia. Glycemic control should be assessed on 
admission using the HbA1c. Electrolytes, renal function, and intravas-
cular volume status should be assessed as well. The high prevalence of 
CVD in individuals with DM (especially in type 2 DM) may necessitate 
preoperative cardiovascular evaluation (Chap. 405).

The  goals  of  diabetes  management  during  hospitalization  are 
near-normoglycemia, avoidance of hypoglycemia, and transition back 
to the outpatient diabetes treatment regimen. Upon hospital admission, 
frequent  glycemic  monitoring  should  begin,  as  should  planning  for 
diabetes management after discharge. CGM in the hospital or ICU set-
ting is not FDA-approved but is under study. Glycemic control appears 
to improve the clinical outcomes in a variety of settings, but optimal 
glycemic  goals  for  the  hospitalized  patient  are  incompletely  defined.  
In  a  number  of  cross-sectional  studies  of  patients  with  diabetes,  a 
greater  degree  of  hyperglycemia  was  associated  with  worse  cardiac, 
neurologic, and infectious outcomes. In some studies, patients who do 
not have preexisting diabetes but who develop modest blood glucose 
elevations during their hospitalization appear to benefit from achiev-
ing  near-normoglycemia  using  insulin  treatment.  However,  a  large 
randomized  clinical  trial  (Normoglycemia  in  Intensive  Care  Evalua-
tion  Survival  Using  Glucose  Algorithm  Regulation  [NICE-SUGAR])

3118 of  individuals  in  the  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)  (most  of  whom  were 
receiving  mechanical  ventilation)  found  an  increased  mortality  rate 
and  a  greater  number  of  episodes  of  severe  hypoglycemia  with  very 
strict  glycemic  control  (target  blood  glucose  of  4.5–6  mmol/L  or 
81–108  mg/dL)  compared  to  individuals  with  a  more  moderate 
glycemic  goal  (target  blood  glucose  of  <10  mmol/L  or  180  mg/dL). 
Currently, most data suggest that very strict blood glucose control in 
acutely ill patients likely worsens outcomes and increases the frequency 
of hypoglycemia. The ADA suggests the following glycemic goals for 
hospitalized patients: (1) in critically or non–critically ill patients: glu-
cose of 7.8–10.0 mmol/L or 140–180 mg/dL; (2) in selected patients: 
glucose of 6.1–7.8 mmol/L or 110–140 mg/dL with avoidance of hypo-
glycemia;  (3)  the  target  range  in  the  perioperative  period  should  be 
80–180 mg/dL (4.4–10.0 mmol/L).

Critical aspects for optimal diabetes care in the hospital include the 
following. (1) A hospital-wide system approach to treatment of hyper-
glycemia and prevention of hypoglycemia is needed. Inpatient diabetes 
management  teams  consisting  of  nurse  practitioners  and  physicians 
are  increasingly  common.  (2)  Diabetes  treatment  plans  should  focus 
on the transition from the ICU and the transition from the inpatient to 
outpatient setting. (3) Adjustment of the discharge treatment regimen 
of  patients  whose  diabetes  was  poorly  controlled  on  admission  (as 
reflected by the HbA1c) is important.

The physician caring for an individual with diabetes in the periop-
erative  period,  during  times  of  infection  or  serious  physical  illness, 
or simply when the patient is fasting for a diagnostic procedure must 
monitor  the  plasma  glucose  vigilantly,  adjust  the  diabetes  treatment 
regimen,  and  provide  glucose  infusion  as  needed.  Hypoglycemia  is 
frequent in hospitalized patients, and many of these episodes are avoid-
able. Hospital systems should have a diabetes management protocol to 
avoid inpatient hypoglycemia. Measures to reduce or prevent hypogly-
cemia include frequent glucose monitoring, but it is also important to 
prevent hypoglycemia by anticipating drops in insulin requirement by 
factors  such  as  decreasing  renal  function,  decreasing  glucocorticoid 
doses, or interruption of nutrition (parenteral or enteral or PO).

Depending  on  the  severity  of  the  patient’s  illness  and  the  hospital 
setting, the physician can use either an insulin infusion or SC insulin. 
Insulin  infusions  are  preferred  in  the  ICU  or  in  a  clinically  unstable 
setting because the half-life of the infused insulin is quite short (min-
utes). The absorption of SC insulin may be variable in such situations. 
Insulin  infusions  can  also  effectively  control  plasma  glucose  in  the 
perioperative period and when the patient is unable to take anything 
by mouth, although for relatively short (<4 h) procedures most patients 
can remain on SC insulin. Regular insulin is used rather than insulin 
analogues  for  IV  insulin  infusion  because  it  is  less  expensive  and 
equally  effective.  The  physician  must  consider  carefully  the  clinical 
setting  in  which  an  insulin  infusion  will  be  used,  including  whether 
adequate ancillary personnel are available to monitor the blood glucose 
frequently  and  whether  they  can  adjust  the  insulin  infusion  rate  to 
maintain the blood glucose within the optimal range. Insulin-infusion 
algorithms  should  integrate  the  insulin  sensitivity  of  the  patient,  fre-
quent blood glucose monitoring, and the trend of changes in the blood 
glucose to determine the insulin-infusion rate. Insulin-infusion algo-
rithms  jointly  developed  and  implemented  by  nursing  and  physician 
staff are advised. Because of the short half-life of IV regular insulin, it 
is necessary to administer long-acting insulin prior to discontinuation 
of the insulin infusion (2–4 h before the infusion is stopped) to avoid a 
period of insulin deficiency.

In  patients  who  are  not  critically  ill  or  not  in  the  ICU,  basal  or 
“scheduled”  insulin  is  provided  by  SC,  long-acting  insulin  supple-
mented  by  prandial  and/or  “corrective”  insulin  using  a  short-acting 
insulin  (insulin  analogues  preferred).  “Sliding  scale,”  short-acting 
insulin  alone,  where  no  insulin  is  given  unless  the  blood  glucose  is 
elevated, is inadequate for inpatient glucose management and should 
not be used. The short-acting, preprandial insulin dose should include 
coverage  for  food  consumption  (based  on  anticipated  carbohydrate 
intake) plus corrective insulin based on the patient’s insulin sensitivity 
and the blood glucose. For example, if the patient is thin (and likely 
insulin-sensitive), an insulin correction factor might be 1 unit for each  

2.7 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) over the glucose target. If the patient is obese 
and  insulin-resistant,  then  the  insulin  correction  factor  might  be  
2 units for each 2.7 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) over the glucose target. It is 
critical to individualize the regimen and adjust the basal or “scheduled” 
insulin  dose  frequently,  based  on  the  corrective  insulin  required.  A 
consistent carbohydrate-controlled diabetes meal plan for hospitalized 
patients provides a predictable amount of carbohydrate for a particular 
meal  each  day  (but  not  necessarily  the  same  amount  for  breakfast, 
lunch,  and  supper)  and  avoids  concentrated  sweets.  Individuals  with 
type 1 DM who are undergoing general anesthesia and surgery or who 
are seriously ill should receive continuous insulin, either through an IV 
insulin infusion, their insulin infusion device, or by SC administration 
of  a  reduced  dose  of  long-acting  insulin.  Short-acting  insulin  alone 
is  insufficient.  Prolongation  of  a  surgical  procedure  or  delay  in  the 
recovery room is not uncommon and may result in periods of insulin 
deficiency  leading  to  DKA.  Insulin  infusion  is  the  preferred  method 
for managing patients with type 1 DM over a prolonged (several hours) 
perioperative  period  or  when  serious  concurrent  illness  is  present  
(0.5–1.0 units/h of regular insulin). If the diagnostic or surgical proce-
dure is brief (<4 h), a reduced dose of SC insulin may suffice (20–50% 
basal reduction, with short-acting bolus insulin withheld or reduced). 
This approach prevents interruption of insulin infusion device therapy, 
or for MDI, facilitates the transition back to long-acting insulin after 
the procedure. The blood glucose should be monitored frequently dur-
ing the illness or in the perioperative period.

Individuals with type 2 DM can be managed with either an insulin 
infusion  or  SC  long-acting  insulin  (20–50%  reduction  depending 
on  clinical  setting)  plus  preprandial,  short-acting  insulin.  Oral  glu-
cose-lowering  agents  should  be  discontinued  upon  admission  (or  up 
to  a  week  prior  to  planned  admission  for  SGLT2  inhibitors)  and  are 
not useful in regulating the plasma glucose in clinical situations where 
the  insulin  requirements  and  glucose  intake  are  changing  rapidly. 
Moreover, these oral agents may be dangerous if the patient is fasting 
(e.g., hypoglycemia with sulfonylureas, euglycemic DKA with SGLT2 
inhibitors) or at risk for declining kidney function due to, for example, 
radiographic  contrast  media  or  unstable  CHF  (lactic  acidosis  with 
metformin).  Once  clinically  stable,  oral  glucose-lowering  agents  may 
be resumed in anticipation of discharge.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN DM
 ■ TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION (TPN)/TOTAL 
ENTERAL NUTRITION (TEN)
(See also Chap. 335)  TPN  or  TEN  greatly  increases  insulin  require-
ments.  In  addition,  individuals  not  previously  known  to  have  DM 
may become hyperglycemic during TPN or TEN and require insulin 
treatment.  For  TPN,  IV  insulin  infusion  is  the  preferred  treatment 
for hyperglycemia, and rapid titration to the required insulin dose is 
done most efficiently using a separate insulin infusion. After the total 
insulin dose has been determined, a proportion of this insulin may be 
added  directly  to  the  TPN  solution  to  cover  the  nutritional  require-
ments for insulin, and adjusted based on the need for modified dosing 
of  short-acting  insulin.  In  TEN,  hyperglycemia  may  be  limited  by 
using high-protein formulations, but often requires insulin treatment. 
Short-acting  insulins  should  be  used  to  cover  bolus  or  continuous 
enteral  feeding  to  minimize  the  risk  for  hypoglycemia  should  the 
TEN be interrupted or held. Patients with insulin deficiency (type 1 
DM and pancreatogenic DM) should also receive long-acting insulin 
(0.1–0.2 units/kg per day) to cover basal insulin requirements should 
the TPN or TEN be interrupted or cycled.

 ■ GLUCOCORTICOIDS
Glucocorticoids  increase  insulin  resistance,  decrease  glucose  utiliza-
tion, increase hepatic glucose production, and impair insulin secretion. 
These changes lead to a worsening of glycemic control in individuals 
with  DM  and  may  precipitate  hyperglycemia  in  other  individuals. 
If  new-onset  hyperglycemia  remains  during  chronic  treatment  with 
supraphysiologic  doses  of  glucocorticoid  (>5  mg  of  prednisone  or 
equivalent),  the  DM  may  be  called  “steroid-induced  diabetes.”  The

effects  of  glucocorticoids  on  glucose  homeostasis  are  dose-related, 
usually  reversible,  most  pronounced  in  the  postprandial  period,  and 
dependent on the timing and type of glucocorticoid. If the FPG is near 
the normal range, oral diabetes agents (e.g., sulfonylureas, metformin) 
may be sufficient to reduce hyperglycemia. If the FPG is >11.1 mmol/L  
(200 mg/dL), oral agents are usually not efficacious, and insulin therapy 
is required. Short-acting insulin may be sufficient alone or together with 
long-acting insulin in order to control postprandial glucose excursions.

 ■ DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN OLDER ADULTS
Diabetes  is  very  common  in  older  adults,  being  present  in  ~25%  of 
individuals  over  the  age  of  65  years.  Increasingly,  individuals  with 
many  years  of  type  1  DM  are  part  of  the  patient  population.  As  dis-
cussed above, individualized therapeutic goals and modalities in older 
adults  should  consider  biologic  age,  other  comorbidities  and  risk 
factors  (hypertension,  CV  disease,  etc.),  neurocognitive  and  physical 
functional status, living arrangements, social support, and other med-
ications. For example, the HbA1c goal for a highly functional 80-year-
old  should  be  different  from  that  for  an  individual  with  diabetes  in 
long-term care (skilled nursing facilities). In the former, the HbA1c goal 
(<7.0–7.5%) and selected therapies may be similar to younger individ-
uals whereas in an individual with complex/poor health or cognitive 
impairment, an HbA1c goal of <8.0–8.5% would be reasonable. Critical 
to  diabetes  management  in  all  older  individuals  is  the  avoidance  of 
hypoglycemia,  which  can  worsen  underlying  cognitive  impairment 
or  CV  disease.  For  individuals  using  CGM,  <1%  of  time  should  be 
spent with glucose <70 mg/dL and spending >50% of time in the target 
range of 70–180 mg/dL is acceptable. Thus, medications that can cause 
hypoglycemia (insulin secretagogues, insulin) should be used carefully. 
In choosing medications for diabetes, the adverse effects (Table 404-5) 
should be considered (especially heart failure, renal insufficiency, etc.). 
Hypertension and dyslipidemia should be treated in elderly individuals 
with diabetes because there is clear benefit of blood pressure control 
with  the  benefit  for  lipid-lowering  medications  being  less  clearly 
demonstrated.

 ■ REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES
Reproductive capacity in either men or women with DM appears to be 
normal. Menstrual cycles may be associated with alterations in glyce-
mic control in women with DM. Pregnancy is associated with marked 
insulin resistance; the increased insulin requirements often precipitate 
DM and lead to the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). 
Glucose,  which  at  high  levels  is  a  teratogen  to  the  developing  fetus, 
readily crosses the placenta, but insulin does not. Thus, hyperglycemia 
from  the  maternal  circulation  may  stimulate  insulin  secretion  in  the 
fetus.  The  anabolic  and  growth  effects  of  insulin  may  result  in  mac-
rosomia.  GDM  complicates  ~7%  (range  1–14%)  of  pregnancies.  The 
incidence of GDM is greatly increased in certain ethnic groups, includ-
ing blacks and Latinas, consistent with a similar increased risk of type 
2  DM.  Current  recommendations  advise  screening  for  glucose  intol-
erance between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy in women not known 
to  have  diabetes.  Therapy  for  GDM  is  similar  to  that  for  individuals 
with pregnancy-associated diabetes and involves MNT and insulin, if 
hyperglycemia persists. Oral glucose-lowering agents are not approved 
for  use  during  pregnancy,  but  studies  using  metformin  or  glyburide 
have shown efficacy and have not found toxicity. With current prac-
tices, the morbidity and mortality rates of the mother with GDM and 
the  fetus  are  not  different  from  those  in  the  nondiabetic  population. 
Individuals who develop GDM are at marked increased risk for devel-
oping type 2 DM in the future and should be screened periodically for 
DM (see screening recommendations in Chap. 403). Most individuals 
with GDM revert to normal glucose tolerance after delivery, but some 
will continue to have overt diabetes or impairment of glucose tolerance 
after delivery. In addition, children of women with GDM appear to be 
at risk for obesity and glucose intolerance and have an increased risk of 
diabetes beginning in the later stages of adolescence.

Pregnancy  in  individuals  with  known  DM  requires  meticulous 
planning and adherence to strict treatment regimens. Intensive insulin 
therapy  and  near-normalization  of  the  HbA1c  (<6.5%)  are  essential 

for  individuals  with  existing  DM  who  are  planning  pregnancy.  Con-
sideration should be given to insulin infusion and CGM devices that 
may  help  to  improve  glycemic  control  prior  to  conception  since  the 
most crucial period of glycemic control is soon after fertilization. The 
risk of fetal malformations is increased 4–10 times in individuals with 
uncontrolled DM at the time of conception, and normal blood glucose 
during the preconception period and throughout the periods of organ 
development in the fetus should be the goal, with more frequent mon-
itoring of HbA1c every 2 months throughout gestation. Maintenance of 
the HbA1c <6.0–6.5% reduces the incidence and severity of fetal mac-
rosomia  and  neonatal  hypoglycemia  related  to  fetal  hyperinsulinism 
driven by elevated maternal glucose.

 ■ LIPODYSTROPHIC DM
Lipodystrophy, or the loss of SC fat tissue, may be generalized in cer-
tain genetic conditions such as leprechaunism, or acquired as part of 
an autoimmune disorder. Generalized lipodystrophy is associated with 
leptin  deficiency  and  severe  insulin  resistance  and  is  often  accom-
panied  by  acanthosis  nigricans,  hepatic  steatosis,  and  severe  hyper-
triglyceridemia.  Recombinant  human  leptin  (metreleptin)  may  allow 
for the achievement of metabolic control in generalized lipodystrophy, 
but is associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies and 
is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation 
and  Mitigation  Strategy  (REMS).  Partial  lipodystrophy  may  also  be 
caused by certain genetic or acquired (e.g., treatment of HIV infection) 
conditions  that  produce  a  metabolic  syndrome  of  insulin  resistance, 
ectopic  fat  accumulation  (hepatic  steatosis),  and  glucose  intolerance 
and dyslipidemia. Treatment of early childhood cancer with total-body 
irradiation  may  affect  adipose  tissue  development  and  predisposes 
survivors to similar metabolic syndrome of adipose tissue dysfunction 
with  potentially  severe  insulin  resistance,  hepatic  steatosis,  hyper-
triglyceridemia, and diabetes.

HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy  Protease  inhibitors  and  nucle-
oside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  used  in  the  treatment  of  HIV 
disease (Chap. 202) have been associated with a centripetal accumu-
lation of fat (visceral and abdominal area), accumulation of fat in the 
dorsocervical region, loss of extremity fat, decreased insulin sensitivity 
(elevations  of  the  fasting  insulin  level  and  reduced  glucose  tolerance 
on  IV  glucose  tolerance  testing),  hepatic  steatosis,  and  dyslipidemia. 
Although many aspects of the physical appearance of these individuals 
resemble Cushing’s syndrome, increased cortisol levels do not account 
for this appearance. The possibility remains that this is related to HIV 
infection  or  highly  active  antiretroviral  therapy  by  some  undefined 
mechanism, because the syndrome can be observed in individuals not 
treated  with  protease  inhibitors.  Therapy  for  HIV-related  lipodystro-
phy  and  associated  metabolic  dysfunction  may  include  metformin, 
especially for abdominal fat accumulation, pioglitazone, especially for 
lipoatrophy  and  hepatic  steatosis.  Tesamorelin,  a  growth  hormone–
releasing hormone analog, is effective for reducing excess abdominal 
fat but requires monitoring of the serum insulin-like growth factor-1 
(IGF-1) level, and may worsen glucose tolerance or exacerbate hyper-
glycemia in individuals with diabetes.

405 Diabetes Mellitus: 
Complications
Alvin C. Powers, John M. Stafford,  
Michael R. Rickels

Diabetes-related  complications  affect  many  organ  systems  and  are 
responsible  for  the  majority  of  morbidity  and  mortality  associated 
with  the  disease.  For  many  years  in  the  United  States,  diabetes  has 
been  the  leading  cause  of  new  blindness  in  adults,  renal  failure,  and 
nontraumatic lower extremity amputation and is a leading contributor 
to  coronary  heart  disease  (CHD).  Diabetes-associated  microvascu-
lar  complications  usually  do  not  appear  until  the  second  decade  of 
hyperglycemia.  In  contrast,  diabetes-associated  CHD  risk,  related  in 
part to insulin resistance and its resultant dyslipidemeia, may develop 
before hyperglycemia is established. Because type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(DM) often has a long asymptomatic period of hyperglycemia before 
diagnosis, many individuals with type 2 DM have both glucose-related 
and insulin resistance–related complications at the time of diagnosis. 
Fortunately,  many  of  the  diabetes-related  complications  can  be  pre-
vented or mitigated with aggressive glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure 
control, as well as efforts at early detection.

Diabetes-related  complications  can  be  divided  into  vascular  and 
nonvascular complications and are similar for type 1 and type 2 DM 
(Table  405-1).  The  vascular  complications  of  DM  are  further  subdi-
vided into microvascular (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy) and

macrovascular complications (CHD, peripheral arterial disease [PAD], 
cerebrovascular  disease).  Microvascular  complications  are  diabetes- 
specific, whereas macrovascular complications have additional patho-
physiologic features that are shared with the general population. Non-
vascular complications include infections, skin changes, hearing loss, 
and increased risk of dementia and impaired cognitive function.
 ■ GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND COMPLICATIONS
The microvascular complications of both type 1 and type 2 DM result 
from  chronic  hyperglycemia  (Fig.  405-1).  Evidence  implicating  a 
causative role for chronic hyperglycemia in the development of mac-
rovascular  complications  is  less  conclusive  as  other  factors  such  as 
dyslipidemia and hypertension also play important roles in macrovas-
cular  complications.  CHD  events  and  mortality  rate  are  two  to  four 
times  greater  in  patients  with  type  2  DM,  correlate  with  fasting  and

postprandial plasma glucose levels as well the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 
and can be reduced by intensive diabetes management as demonstrated 
in patients with type 1 DM.

The  Diabetes  Control  and  Complications  Trial  (DCCT)  provided 
definitive proof that reduction in chronic hyperglycemia can prevent 
many complications of type 1 DM (Fig. 405-1). This large multicenter 
clinical trial randomized >1400 individuals with type 1 DM to either 
intensive  or  conventional  diabetes  management  and  prospectively 
evaluated the development of diabetes-related complications during a 
mean follow-up of 6.5 years. Individuals in the intensive diabetes man-
agement group received insulin by multiple daily injections or pump 
delivery along with extensive educational, psychological, and medical 
support, and achieved a substantially lower HbA1c (7.3%) than individ-
uals in the conventional diabetes management group (9.1%). After the 
DCCT results were reported in 1993, study participants were all offered 
intensive therapy and continue to be followed in the Epidemiology of 
Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC) trial, which has com-
pleted >30 years of follow-up (DCCT + EDIC). During the subsequent 
follow-up of >18 years, the initial separation in glycemic control dis-
appeared with both arms maintaining a mean HbA1c of 8.0%, allowing 
assessment of a legacy effect of 6.5 years of near-normoglycemia on the 
development of long-term complications.

The  DCCT  phase  demonstrated  that  improvement  of  glycemic 
control  reduced  nonproliferative  and  proliferative  retinopathy  (47% 
reduction),  albuminuria  (39%  reduction),  clinical  nephropathy  (54% 
reduction),  and  neuropathy  (60%  reduction).  Improved  glycemic 
control  also  slowed  the  progression  of  early  diabetic  complications. 
During the DCCT phase, weight gain (4.6 kg) and severe hypoglycemia 
(requiring assistance of another person to treat) were more common 
in the intensive therapy group. The benefits of an improvement in gly-
cemic control occurred over the entire range of elevated HbA1c values 
(Fig.  405-1).  The  results  of  the  DCCT  predicted  that  individuals  in 
the  intensive  diabetes  management  group  would  gain  7.7  additional 
years of vision, 5.8 additional years free from end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD),  and  5.6  years  free  from  lower  extremity  amputations.  If  all 
complications  of  DM  were  combined,  individuals  in  the  intensive 
diabetes management group would experience >15.3 more years of life 
without significant microvascular complications of DM, compared to 
individuals who received standard therapy. This translates into an addi-
tional 5.1 years of life expectancy for individuals in the intensive diabe-
tes management group. The 30-year follow-up data in the intensively 
treated group show a continued reduction in retinopathy, nephropathy, 
and  cardiovascular  disease.  For  example,  individuals  in  the  intensive 
therapy group had a 42–57% reduction in cardiovascular events (non-
fatal myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, or death from a cardiovascular 
event) at a mean follow-up of 18 years, even though their subsequent 
glycemic  control  was  the  same  as  those  in  the  conventional  diabetes 
management group from years 6.5 to 17. During the EDIC phase, <1% 
of the cohort had become blind, lost a limb to amputation, or required 
dialysis. Other complications of diabetes, including autonomic neurop-
athy, bladder and sexual dysfunction, and cardiac autonomic neuropa-
thy, were reduced in the intensive therapy group.

The  United  Kingdom  Prospective  Diabetes  Study  (UKPDS)  stud-
ied  the  course  of  >5000  individuals  with  type  2  DM  for  >10  years. 
This  study  used  multiple  treatment  regimens  and  monitored  the 
effect  of  intensive  glycemic  control  and  risk  factor  treatment  on  the 
development  of  diabetic  complications.  Newly  diagnosed  individuals 
with type 2 DM were randomized to (1) intensive management using 
various  combinations  of  insulin,  a  sulfonylurea,  or  metformin  or  (2) 
conventional therapy using dietary modification and pharmacotherapy 
with  the  goal  of  symptom  prevention.  In  addition,  individuals  were 
randomly assigned to different antihypertensive regimens. Individuals 
in the intensive treatment arm achieved an HbA1c of 7% compared to 
7.9% in the standard treatment group. The UKPDS demonstrated that 
each percentage point reduction in HbA1c was associated with a 35% 
reduction in microvascular complications. As in the DCCT, there was 
a continuous relationship between glycemic control and development 
of complications. Improved glycemic control also reduced the cardio-
vascular event rate in the follow-up period of >10 years.

One  of  the  major  findings  of  the  UKPDS  was  that  strict  blood 
pressure control significantly reduced both macro- and microvascular 
complications. In fact, the beneficial effects of blood pressure control 
were greater than the beneficial effects of glycemic control. Lowering 
blood pressure to moderate goals (144/82 mmHg) reduced the risk of 
DM-related  death,  stroke,  microvascular  endpoints,  retinopathy,  and 
heart  failure  (risk  reductions  between  32  and  56%).  The  American 
Diabetes  Association  (ADA)  recommends  blood  pressure  control 
<130/80  mmHg  for  individuals  with  high  cardiovascular  risk  and 
<140/90 mmHg for individuals with lower cardiovascular risk.

Similar reductions in the risks of retinopathy and nephropathy were 
also seen in a small trial of lean Japanese individuals with type 2 DM 
randomized  to  either  intensive  glycemic  control  or  standard  therapy 
with insulin (Kumamoto study). These results demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of improved glycemic control in individuals of different eth-
nicity and, presumably, a different etiology of DM (i.e., phenotypically 
different from those in the DCCT and UKPDS). The Action to Control 
Cardiovascular  Risk  in  Diabetes  (ACCORD)  and  Action  in  Diabetes 
and  Vascular  Disease:  Preterax  and  Diamicron  MR  Controlled  Eval-
uation (ADVANCE) trials also found that improved glycemic control 
reduced microvascular complications.

Thus, these large clinical trials in type 1 and type 2 DM indicate that 
chronic  hyperglycemia  plays  a  causative  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of 
diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications. In both the DCCT 
and  the  UKPDS,  cardiovascular  events  were  reduced  at  follow-up  of 
>10 years, even though the improved glycemic control was not main-
tained. This legacy effect for a positive impact of a period of improved 
glycemic control on later diabetes complications has been attributed to 
the benefits of metabolic memory. Of note, despite long-standing DM, 
some individuals never develop retinopathy or nephropathy, suggest-
ing a genetic susceptibility for developing particular complications.

 ■ MECHANISMS OF COMPLICATIONS
Chronic  hyperglycemia  is  the  important  etiologic  factor  leading  to 
complications of DM, but the mechanism(s) by which it leads to such 
diverse cellular and organ dysfunction is unknown. The complications 
are  likely  multifactorial  with  an  emerging  hypothesis  that  hypergly-
cemia  leads  to  epigenetic  changes  (Chap.  466)  that  influence  gene 
expression in affected cells. Chronic hyperglycemia leads to formation 
of  advanced  glycosylation  end  products  (AGEs;  e.g.,  pentosidine, 
glucosepane,  and  carboxymethyllysine),  which  bind  to  specific  cell 
surface receptor and/or the nonenzymatic glycosylation of intra- and 
extracellular proteins, leading to cross-linking of proteins, glomerular 
dysfunction,  endothelial  dysfunction,  altered  extracellular  matrix 
composition,  and  accelerated  atherosclerosis.  The  reduction  of  cellu-
lar glucose entry afforded in certain tissues such as myocardium and 
renal  tubular  epithelium  through  inhibition  of  the  sodium  glucose 
co-transporter-2  (SGLT-2)  may  contribute  to  the  reduction  in  CHD 
events and renoprotective effects.

Growth factors may play an important role in some diabetes-related 
microvascular  complications,  and  their  production  is  increased  by 
most  of  these  proposed  pathways.  For  example,  vascular  endothelial 
growth factor A (VEGF-A) is increased locally in diabetic proliferative 
retinopathy,  decreases  after  laser  photocoagulation,  and  is  the  target 
inhibited by intravitreous injection therapy. A possible unifying mech-
anism is that hyperglycemia leads to increased production of reactive 
oxygen species or superoxide in the mitochondria and this may acti-
vate  several  pathways.  Although  hyperglycemia  serves  as  the  initial 
trigger  for  complications  of  diabetes,  it  is  still  unknown  whether  the 
same pathophysiologic processes are operative in all complications or 
whether some pathways predominate in certain organs.

The  mechanisms  of  diabetes-related  macrovascular  complications 
including  MI  and  stroke  are  glucose-related  mechanisms  but  also 
include  traditional  cardiovascular  risk  factors  (dyslipidemia,  hyper-
tension) and insulin resistance. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is 
present years prior to diagnosis and is associated with obesity and ecto-
pic accumulation of lipids in muscle and liver. Additionally, insulin fails 
to appropriately suppress lipolysis from adipose tissue, which results in 
increased delivery of fatty acids to liver, muscle, endothelial cells, and

with  either  type  1  or  type  2  DM.  Paradoxically,  during  the  first 
6–12  months  of  improved  glycemic  control,  established  diabetic 
retinopathy  may  transiently  worsen.  Fortunately,  this  progression 
is  temporary,  and  in  the  long  term,  improved  glycemic  control  is 
associated  with  less  diabetic  retinopathy.  Individuals  with  known 
retinopathy  may  be  candidates  for  prophylactic  laser  photocoag-
ulation  when  initiating  intensive  therapy,  and  especially  prior  to 
pancreas or islet transplantation that can rapidly normalize glyce-
mia. Women with type 1 or type 2 DM who are planning pregnancy 
should be screened prior to and during pregnancy. Once advanced 
retinopathy  is  present,  improved  glycemic  control  imparts  less 
benefit, although adequate ophthalmologic care can prevent most 
blindness. Lowering elevated levels of triglycerides with fenofibrate 
may reduce the progression of retinopathy.

Regular,  comprehensive  eye  examinations  are  essential  for  all 
individuals  with  DM  (see  Table  404-1).  Most  diabetic  eye  disease 
can be successfully treated if detected early. Routine, nondilated eye 
examinations by the primary care provider or diabetes specialist are 
inadequate to detect diabetic eye disease, which requires a dilated 
eye  exam  performed  by  an  optometrist  or  ophthalmologist,  and 
subsequent management by a retinal specialist. Treatment of severe 
nonproliferative or proliferative retinopathy or macular edema with 
laser  photocoagulation  and/or  anti-VEGF  therapy  (intravitreous 
injection) usually is successful in preserving vision. Aspirin therapy 
(up to 650 mg/d) does not appear to influence the natural history 
of diabetic retinopathy, and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulation 
may  be  continued  in  patients  receiving  intravitreal  injections  of 
anti-VEGF  agents.  Patients  with  severe  proliferative  retinopathy 
with  vitreous  hemorrhage  and/or  traction  involving  the  macula 
often require surgical vitrectomy.

 ■ RENAL COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES MELLITUS
Diabetic  nephropathy  is  the  leading  cause  of  chronic  kidney  disease 
(CKD) and ESRD requiring renal replacement therapy. CKD in indi-
viduals with DM is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease,  and  the  prognosis  of  individuals  with  diabetes  on  dialysis  is 
poor. Individuals with diabetic nephropathy commonly have diabetic 
retinopathy.  The  presence  of  CKD  in  individuals  with  DM  and  no 
retinopathy should prompt investigation for alternative causes of kid-
ney disease.

Like  other  microvascular  complications,  the  pathogenesis  of  dia-
betic  nephropathy  is  related  to  chronic  hyperglycemia.  The  mecha-
nisms by which chronic hyperglycemia leads to diabetic nephropathy, 
although  incompletely  defined,  involve  the  effects  of  soluble  factors 
(growth  factors,  angiotensin  II,  endothelin,  AGEs),  hemodynamic 
alterations  in  the  renal  microcirculation  (glomerular  hyperfiltration 
or  hyperperfusion,  increased  glomerular  capillary  pressure),  and 
structural  changes  in  the  glomerulus  (increased  extracellular  matrix, 
basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion, fibrosis). Some 
of  these  effects  may  be  mediated  through  angiotensin  II  and  miner-
alocorticoid receptors. Smoking accelerates the decline in renal func-
tion. Because only 20–40% of patients with diabetes develop diabetic 
nephropathy, additional genetic or environmental susceptibility factors 
likely  contribute.  Known  risk  factors  include  a  family  history  of  dia-
betic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy and ESRD secondary to DM 
develop more commonly in blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanic 
individuals with diabetes.

The  natural  history  of  diabetic  nephropathy  is  characterized  by  a 
sequence of events that was initially defined for individuals with type 
1  DM  but  appears  similar  in  type  2  DM  (Fig.  405-3).  Glomerular 
hyperperfusion  and  renal  hypertrophy  occur  in  the  first  years  after 
the onset of DM and are associated with an increase of the estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR). During the first 5 years of DM, thick-
ening of the glomerular basement membrane, glomerular hypertrophy, 
and mesangial volume expansion occur as the GFR returns to normal. 
After 5–10 years of type 1 DM, many individuals begin to excrete small 
amounts of albumin in the urine. The ADA defines albuminuria as a 
persistently  increased  urinary  albumin-to-creatinine  ratio  >30  mg/g 

FIGURE  405-2  Diabetic  retinopathy  results  in  scattered  hemorrhages,  yellow 
exudates,  and  neovascularization.  This  patient  has  neovascular  vessels

cardiac tissues, leading to tissue accumulation of triglycerides, diacylg-
lycerol, and ceramides.

 ■ OPHTHALMOLOGIC COMPLICATIONS  
OF DIABETES MELLITUS
DM  is  the  leading  cause  of  blindness  between  the  ages  of  20  and 
74 in the United States. Severe vision loss is primarily the result of 
progressive diabetic retinopathy, which leads to significant macular 
edema and new blood vessel formation. Diabetic retinopathy is clas-
sified into two stages: nonproliferative and proliferative. Nonprolif-
erative diabetic retinopathy usually appears late in the first decade or 
early in the second decade of hyperglycemia and is marked by reti-
nal  vascular  microaneurysms,  blot  hemorrhages,  and  cotton-wool 
spots (Fig. 405-2). Mild nonproliferative retinopathy may progress 
to  more  extensive  disease,  characterized  by  changes  in  venous  vessel 
caliber, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, and more numerous 
microaneurysms  and  hemorrhages.  The  pathophysiologic  mecha-
nisms  invoked  in  nonproliferative  retinopathy  include  loss  of  retinal 
pericytes, increased retinal vascular permeability, alterations in retinal 
blood  flow,  and  abnormal  retinal  microvasculature,  all  of  which  can 
lead to retinal ischemia.

The appearance of neovascularization in response to retinal hypox-
emia is the hallmark of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (Fig. 405-2). 
These newly formed vessels appear near the optic nerve and/or macula 
and rupture easily, leading to vitreous hemorrhage, fibrosis, and ulti-
mately  retinal  detachment.  Not  all  individuals  with  nonproliferative 
retinopathy  go  on  to  develop  proliferative  retinopathy,  but  the  more 
severe the nonproliferative disease, the greater the chance of evolution 
to proliferative retinopathy within 5 years. This creates an important 
opportunity for early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. 
Clinically significant macular edema can occur in the context of non-
proliferative or proliferative retinopathy. Fluorescein angiography and 
optical  coherence  tomography  are  useful  to  detect  macular  edema, 
which  is  associated  with  a  25%  chance  of  moderate  visual  loss  over 
the next 3 years. Duration of DM and degree of glycemic control are 
the  best  predictors  of  the  development  of  retinopathy;  hypertension, 
nephropathy,  and  dyslipidemia  are  also  risk  factors.  Nonprolifera-
tive  retinopathy  is  found  in  many  individuals  who  have  had  DM  for 
>20  years.  Although  there  is  genetic  susceptibility  for  retinopathy,  it 
confers less influence than either the duration of DM or the degree of 
glycemic control.

TREATMENT
Diabetic Retinopathy

The  most  effective  therapy  for  diabetic  retinopathy  is  prevention. 
Intensive glycemic and blood pressure control will delay the devel-
opment  and  slow  the  progression  of  retinopathy  in  individuals

on  a  spot  specimen.  In  some  individuals  with  DM  and  albuminuria 
of  short  duration,  the  albuminuria  can  regress  with  improvement  in 
glycemic control (Fig. 405-4) or with improvement in blood pressure 
control using angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and/or SGLT-2 
inhibitor  therapy.  Diabetic  kidney  disease  refers  to  albuminuria  and 
reduced  GFR  (<60  mL/min  per  1.73  m2);  CKD  related  to  diabetes, 
which  may  not  be  accompanied  by  albuminuria,  is  also  discussed  in 
Chap. 311. Once there is marked albuminuria and a reduction in GFR, 
the pathologic changes are likely irreversible.

The  nephropathy  that  develops  in  type  2  DM  differs  from  that  of 
type  1  DM  in  that  albuminuria  may  be  present  when  type  2  DM  is 
diagnosed, reflecting its long asymptomatic period, and hypertension 
more  often  contributes  to  albuminuria  and  reduced  GFR.  Finally,  it 
should be noted that albuminuria in type 2 DM may be secondary to 
factors unrelated to DM, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure 
(CHF), prostate disease, or infection.

As  part  of  comprehensive  diabetes  care  (Chap.  404),  albuminuria 
should  be  detected  at  an  early  stage  when  effective  therapies  can  be 
instituted.  Because  some  individuals  with  type  1  or  type  2  DM  have 
a  decline  in  GFR  in  the  absence  of  albuminuria,  assessment  should 
include  a  spot  urinary  albumin-to-creatinine  ratio  and  an  estimated 
GFR.  The  urine  protein  measurement  by  routine  urinalysis  does  not 
detect  low  levels  of  albumin  excretion.  Screening  for  albuminuria 

should commence 5 years after the onset of type 1 DM and at the time 
of diagnosis of type 2 DM.

Type IV renal tubular acidosis (hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism) 
may occur in type 1 or 2 DM. These individuals develop a propensity to 
hyperkalemia and acidemia, which may be exacerbated by medications 
(especially angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angioten-
sin  receptor  blockers  [ARBs],  and  mineralocorticoid  receptor  antag-
onists).  Patients  with  DM  are  predisposed  to  radiocontrast-induced 
nephrotoxicity.  Risk  factors  for  radiocontrast-induced  nephrotoxicity 
are  preexisting  nephropathy  and  volume  depletion.  Individuals  with 
DM undergoing radiographic procedures with contrast dye should be 
well hydrated before and after dye exposure, and the serum creatinine 
should be monitored for 24–48 h following the procedure. Metformin 
should be held until postintervention confirmation of preserved kid-
ney function.

TREATMENT
Diabetic Nephropathy

The  optimal  therapy  for  diabetic  nephropathy  is  prevention  by 
control  of  glycemia  (Chap.  404  outlines  glycemic  goals  and 
approaches).  Interventions  effective  in  slowing  progression  of

albuminuria  and  declining  kidney  function  include  (1)  improved 
glycemic control, (2) strict blood pressure control, (3) administra-
tion of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, and (4) in individuals with type 
2 DM, administration of a SGLT-2 inhibitor. Dyslipidemia should 
also be treated.

Improved glycemic control reduces the rate at which albuminuria 
appears  and  progresses  in  type  1  and  type  2  DM.  However,  once 
there  is  a  large  amount  of  albuminuria,  it  becomes  more  difficult 
for improved glycemic control to slow progression of renal disease, 
although 10-years of normoglycemia resulting from pancreas trans-
plantation  may  lead  to  regression  of  mesangial  glomerular  lesions 
(Fig.  405-4).  During  the  later  phase  of  declining  renal  function, 
insulin requirements may fall as the kidney is a site of insulin degra-
dation. As the GFR decreases with progressive nephropathy, the use 
and dose of glucose-lowering agents should be reevaluated (see Table 
404-5). Some glucose-lowering medications (sulfonylureas and met-
formin)  are  contraindicated  in  advanced  renal  insufficiency,  while 
others may require dose adjustment (glinides and DPP-4 inhibitors).
Many individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM develop hyperten-
sion. Numerous studies in both type 1 and type 2 DM demonstrate 
the effectiveness of strict blood pressure control in reducing albu-
min  excretion  and  slowing  the  decline  in  renal  function.  Blood 
pressure  should  be  maintained  at  <140/90  mmHg  in  individu-
als  with  diabetes  and  possibly  <130/80  mmHg  in  individuals  at 
increased risk for CVD and CKD progression.

Either  ACE  inhibitors  or  ARBs  should  be  used  to  reduce  the 
albuminuria and the associated decline in GFR in individuals with 
type  1  or  type  2  DM  (see  “Hypertension,”  below).  Most  experts 
believe that the two classes of drugs are equivalent in patient with 
diabetes. ARBs can be used as an alternative in patients who develop 
ACE inhibitor–associated cough or angioedema. After initiation of 
therapy, some increase the dose and monitor the urinary albumin. 
There  is  no  benefit  of  intervention  prior  to  onset  of  albuminuria 
or using a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB. If use of 
either ACE inhibitors or ARBs is not possible or the blood pressure 
is not controlled, then diuretics, calcium channel blockers (nondi-
hydropyridine class), or beta blockers (with caution in individuals 
at increased risk for experiencing hypoglycemia) may be used. Min-
eralocorticoid receptor antagonists can help reduce blood pressure 
and albuminuria in refractory cases but require close monitoring of 
the serum potassium. SGLT-2 inhibitors can reduce albuminuria 
and,  after  an  initial  decline  (~3  mL/min  per  1.73  m2)  in  GFR, 
may  slow  further  decline  in  kidney  function  in  individuals  with 
and without T2DM and CKD. The mechanism of action of SGLT-2 
inhibitors is multifactorial and includes inducing natriuresis, reduc-
ing  intraglomerular  pressure  through  restored  tubuloglomerular 
feedback,  and  potentially  altering  signaling  pathways  related  to 
nutrient  sensing  (e.g.,  AMPK).  Because  of  the  elevated  risk  of 
euglycemic  diabetic  ketoacidosis  with  SGLT-2  inhibitors,  use  in 
individuals with type 1 DM and insulin-deficient type 2 DM is not 
recommended.  Some  glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1)  receptor 
agonists  may  also  both  improve  glycemic  control  and  reduce  the 
progression  of  diabetic  kidney  disease  in  individuals  with  type  2 
DM and established CVD (Chap. 404). The ADA suggests a protein 
intake of 0.8 mg/kg of body weight/day in individuals with diabetic 
kidney disease.

Nephrology  consultation  should  be  considered  when  the  esti-
mated GFR is <30 mL/min per 1.743 m2 or with atypical features 
such as hematuria, rapidly declining renal function, or proteinuria 
> 3 g/day. Complications of atherosclerosis are the leading cause of 
death in diabetic individuals with nephropathy and hyperlipidemia 
should  be  treated  aggressively.  Referral  for  transplant  evaluation 
should be made when the GFR approaches 20 mL/min per 1.73 m2. 
Preemptive  (before  dialysis)  kidney  transplantation  from  a  living 
donor  or  simultaneous  pancreas-kidney  transplantation  from  a 
deceased  donor  both  offer  improved  patient  and  kidney  survival 
over  waiting  for  a  deceased  donor  kidney  alone.  A  combined 
pancreas-kidney  transplant  offers  the  promise  of  normoglycemia 
and  freedom  from  both  insulin  and  dialysis.  As  compared  with 

nondiabetic individuals, hemodialysis in patients with DM is asso-
ciated  with  more  frequent  complications,  such  as  hypotension 
(due to autonomic neuropathy or loss of reflex tachycardia), more 
difficult vascular access, and accelerated progression of retinopathy.

 ■ NEUROPATHY AND DIABETES MELLITUS
Diabetic neuropathy, which occurs in ~50% of individuals with long-
standing  type  1  and  type  2  DM,  manifests  as  a  diffuse  neuropathy 
(distal symmetrical polyneuropathy and/or autonomic neuropathy), a 
mononeuropathy,  and/or  a  radiculopathy/polyradiculopathy.  As  with 
other complications of DM, the development of neuropathy correlates 
with  the  duration  of  diabetes  and  glycemic  control.  Additional  risk 
factors are body mass index (BMI) (the greater the BMI, the greater the 
risk of neuropathy) and smoking. The presence of CVD, elevated trig-
lycerides, and hypertension is also associated with diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy.  Both  myelinated  and  unmyelinated  nerve  fibers  are  lost. 
Because the clinical features of diabetic neuropathy are similar to those 
of other neuropathies, the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy should be 
made only after other possible etiologies are excluded (Chap. 446).

Distal  Symmetric  Polyneuropathy  (DSPN)  DSPN,  the  most 
common form of diabetic neuropathy, most frequently presents with 
distal  sensory  loss  and  pain,  but  up  to  50%  of  patients  do  not  have 
symptoms of neuropathy. Symptoms may include a sensation of numb-
ness, tingling, sharpness, or burning that begins in the feet and spreads 
proximally. Hyperesthesia, paresthesia, and dysesthesia also may occur. 
Pain typically involves the lower extremities, is usually present at rest, 
and worsens at night. Both an acute (lasting <12 months) and a chronic 
form  of  painful  diabetic  neuropathy  may  occur.  The  acute  form  is 
sometimes  treatment-related,  occurring  in  the  context  of  improved 
glycemic control. As diabetic neuropathy progresses, the pain subsides 
and  eventually  disappears,  but  a  sensory  deficit  persists,  and  motor 
defects may develop. Physical examination (Chap. 403) often reveals 
sensory  loss  (to  10-g  monofilament  and/or  vibration),  loss  of  ankle 
deep-tendon reflexes, abnormal position sense, and muscular atrophy 
or  foot  drop.  Annual  screening  for  DSPN  should  begin  5  years  after 
diagnosis of type 1 DM and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 DM and 
is  aimed  at  detecting  loss  of  protective  sensation  (LOPS).  LOPS  and 
DSPN are major risk factors for foot ulceration and falls due to small 
and  large  nerve  fiber  dysfunction  and  predispose  to  lower  extremity 
amputation.

Autonomic  Neuropathy 
Individuals  with  long-standing  type  1 
or  2  DM  may  develop  signs  of  autonomic  dysfunction  involving  the 
parasympathetic  (cholinergic)  and  sympathetic  (adrenergic)  systems. 
DM-related autonomic neuropathy can affect multiple organ systems, 
including  the  cardiovascular,  gastrointestinal  (GI),  genitourinary, 
sudomotor,  and  metabolic  systems.  Cardiovascular  autonomic  neu-
ropathy,  reflected  by  decreased  heart  rate  variability,  resting  tachy-
cardia,  and  orthostatic  hypotension,  is  associated  with  an  increase 
in  CVD.  Orthostatic  hypotension,  a  late  and  unusual  complication 
of  diabetes,  is  sometimes  seen  in  patients  with  associated  DPN  and 
severe  parasympathetic  dysfunction.  Reports  of  sudden  death  in 
DM have also been attributed to autonomic neuropathy affecting the 
cardiovascular system and predisposing to severe hypoglycemia, both 
of which may prolong the QTc interval. Autonomic neuropathy may 
reduce  counterregulatory  hormone  release  (especially  epinephrine), 
leading  to  an  inability  to  sense  hypoglycemia  appropriately  (hypo-
glycemia  unawareness)  (Chap.  406)  and  subjecting  the  patient  to 
the risk of severe hypoglycemia. Gastroparesis and bladder-emptying 
abnormalities are often caused by the autonomic neuropathy seen in 
DM  (discussed  below).  Hyperhidrosis  of  the  upper  extremities  and 
anhidrosis  of  the  lower  extremities  result  from  sympathetic  nervous 
system dysfunction. Anhidrosis of the feet can promote dry skin with 
cracking, which increases the risk of foot ulcers.

Mononeuropathy  and/or  Radiculopathy/Polyradiculopathy  
Mononeuropathy (dysfunction of isolated cranial or peripheral nerves) 
is  less  common  than  polyneuropathy  in  DM  and  presents  with  pain 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   3124

20/01/22   3:24 PM

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismand  motor  weakness  in  the  distribution  of  a  single  nerve.  Monon-
europathies  can  occur  at  entrapment  sites  such  as  carpal  tunnel  or 
be  noncompressive.  Involvement  of  the  third  cranial  nerve  is  most 
common  and  is  heralded  by  diplopia.  Physical  examination  reveals 
ptosis and ophthalmoplegia with normal pupillary constriction to light. 
Sometimes other cranial nerves, such as IV, VI, or VII (Bell’s palsy), are 
affected.  Peripheral  mononeuropathies  or  simultaneous  involvement 
of more than one nerve (mononeuropathy multiplex) may also occur. 
Diabetic radiculopathy or polyradiculopathy is a syndrome character-
ized by severe disabling pain in the distribution of one or more nerve 
roots. It may be accompanied by motor weakness. Intercostal or truncal 
radiculopathy causes pain over the thorax or abdomen. Involvement of 
the lumbar plexus or femoral nerve may cause severe pain in the thigh 
or hip and may be associated with muscle weakness in the hip flexors 
or extensors (diabetic amyotrophy). Fortunately, diabetic polyradicu-
lopathies are usually self-limited and resolve over 6–12 months.

TREATMENT
Diabetic Neuropathy

Prevention  of  diabetic  neuropathy  is  critical  through  improved 
glycemic  control.  Treatment  of  diabetic  neuropathy  is  less  than 
satisfactory. Lifestyle modifications (exercise, diet) have some effi-
cacy  in  DSPN  in  type  2  DM  and  hypertension,  and  hypertriglyc-
eridemia  should  be  treated.  Efforts  to  improve  glycemic  control 
in  long-standing  diabetes  may  be  confounded  by  hypoglycemia 
unawareness. Patients should avoid neurotoxins (including alcohol) 
and smoking, and consider supplementation with vitamins for pos-
sible  deficiencies  (B12,  folate;  Chap.  333).  Metformin  may  reduce 
intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 in type 2 DM, and pernicious 
anemia is more common in type 1 DM where it is associated with 
anti–parietal  cell  autoantibodies  and  may  require  sublingual  or 
parenteral B12 replacement. Patients should be educated that loss of 
sensation in the foot increases the risk for ulceration and its seque-
lae  and  that  prevention  of  such  problems  is  paramount.  Patients 
with symptoms or signs of neuropathy or LOPS should check their 
feet  daily  and  take  precautions  (footwear)  aimed  at  preventing 
calluses or ulcerations. If foot deformities are present, a podiatrist 
should be involved.

Chronic,  painful  diabetic  neuropathy  is  difficult  to  treat  with 
only symptomatic treatment being available; evidence of the effec-
tiveness of improved glycemic control in painful diabetic neuropa-
thy is lacking. Two oral agents approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), duloxetine and pregabalin, or gabapentin is 
usually initially used for pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. 
Diabetic neuropathy may respond to tricyclic antidepressants, ven-
lafaxine,  carbamazepine,  tramadol,  or  topical  capsaicin  products. 
An  8%  capsaicin  patch  requires  application  by  a  health  care  pro-
vider. Tapentadol, a centrally acting opioid, is also approved by the 
FDA, but has only modest efficacy and poses addiction risk, making 
it and other opioids less desirable and not a first-line therapy. No 
direct  comparisons  of  agents  are  available,  and  it  is  reasonable  to 
switch agents if there is no response or if side effects develop. Refer-
ral to a pain management center may be necessary.

Therapy  of  orthostatic  hypotension  secondary  to  autonomic 
neuropathy  is  also  difficult.  Nonpharmacologic  maneuvers  (ade-
quate  salt  intake,  avoidance  of  dehydration  and  diuretics,  lower 
extremity  support  hose,  and  physical  activity)  may  offer  some 
benefit.  A  variety  of  agents  have  limited  success  (midodrine  and 
droxidopa are approved by the FDA for orthostatic hypotension of 
any etiology). Patients with resting tachycardia may be considered 
for  beta  blocker  therapy  with  caution  exercised  if  there  is  hypo-
glycemia  unawareness.  Patients  with  type  1  DM  and  orthostatic 
hypotension should be evaluated for primary adrenal insufficiency 
(Addison’s disease) that may be associated with anti-21-hydroxylase 
autoantibodies as part of an autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome 
(Chap. 389).

 ■ GASTROINTESTINAL/GENITOURINARY 
DYSFUNCTION
Long-standing type 1 and 2 DM may affect the motility and function of 
the GI and genitourinary systems. The most prominent GI symptoms 
are  delayed  gastric  emptying  (gastroparesis)  and  altered  small-  and 
large-bowel  motility  (constipation  or  diarrhea).  Gastroparesis  may 
present  with  symptoms  of  anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  early  satiety, 
and  abdominal  bloating.  Microvascular  complications  (retinopathy 
and  neuropathy)  are  usually  present.  Nuclear  medicine  scintigraphy 
after  ingestion  of  a  radiolabeled  meal  may  document  delayed  gastric 
emptying but may not correlate well with the patient’s symptoms. Non-
invasive  “breath  tests”  following  ingestion  of  a  radiolabeled  meal  are 
emerging as a diagnostic tool. Although parasympathetic dysfunction 
secondary to chronic hyperglycemia is important in the development 
of  gastroparesis,  hyperglycemia  itself  also  impairs  gastric  emptying. 
Nocturnal  diarrhea,  alternating  with  constipation,  is  a  feature  of 
DM-related GI autonomic neuropathy. In type 1 DM, these symptoms 
should also prompt evaluation for celiac disease that is associated with 
anti-tissue  transglutaminase  autoantibodies  because  of  its  increased 
frequency.

Diabetic  autonomic  neuropathy  may  lead  to  genitourinary  dys-
function including cystopathy and female sexual dysfunction (reduced 
sexual desire, dyspareunia, reduced vaginal lubrication). Symptoms of 
diabetic cystopathy begin with an inability to sense a full bladder and 
a failure to void completely. As bladder contractility worsens, bladder 
capacity  and  the  postvoid  residual  increase,  leading  to  symptoms  of 
urinary  hesitancy,  decreased  voiding  frequency,  incontinence,  and 
recurrent urinary tract infections.

Erectile dysfunction  and  retrograde  ejaculation  are  very  common 
in  DM  and  may  be  one  of  the  earliest  signs  of  diabetic  neuropathy 
(Chap. 397). Erectile dysfunction, which increases in frequency with 
the age of the patient and the duration of diabetes, may occur in the 
absence of other signs of diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

TREATMENT
Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary Dysfunction

Current treatments for these complications of DM are inadequate 
and  nonspecific.  Improved  glycemic  control  should  be  a  goal  but 
has  not  clearly  shown  benefit.  Smaller,  more  frequent  meals  that 
are easier to digest (liquid) and low in fat and fiber may minimize 
symptoms of gastroparesis. Medications that slow gastric emptying 
(opioids, GLP-1 receptor agonists) should be avoided. Metoclopra-
mide may be used with severe symptoms but is restricted to short-
term treatment in both the United States and Europe. Symptoms of 
gastroesophageal reflux disease may require acid blocking therapy 
with a histamine-2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor. 
Gastric electrical stimulatory devices are available but not approved. 
Diabetic diarrhea in the absence of bacterial overgrowth is treated 
symptomatically (Chap. 325).

Diabetic  cystopathy  should  be  treated  with  scheduled  voiding 
or self-catheterization. Drugs that inhibit type 5 phosphodiesterase 
are effective for erectile dysfunction, but their efficacy in individ-
uals with DM is slightly lower than in the nondiabetic population 
(Chap. 397).

 ■ CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY
CVD  is  increased  in  individuals  with  type  1  or  type  2  DM.  The 
Framingham Heart Study revealed a marked increase in PAD, coronary 
artery  disease,  MI,  and  CHF  (risk  increase  from  one-  to  fivefold)  in 
DM. In addition, the prognosis for individuals with diabetes who have 
coronary  artery  disease  or  MI  is  worse  than  for  nondiabetics.  CHD 
is  more  likely  to  involve  multiple  vessels  in  individuals  with  DM.  In 
addition  to  CHD,  cerebrovascular  disease  is  increased  in  individuals 
with DM (threefold increase in stroke). Thus, after controlling for all 
known cardiovascular risk factors, both type 1 and type 2 DM increases 
the cardiovascular death rate twofold in men and fourfold in women. 
CHF is common in long-standing DM.

The  American  Heart  Association  considers  DM  as  a  controllable 
risk  factor  for  cardiovascular  disease;  in  some  studies,  type  2  DM 
patients  without  a  prior  MI  have  a  similar  risk  for  coronary  artery- 
related  events  as  nondiabetic  individuals  who  have  had  a  prior  MI. 
Cardiovascular risk assessment in type 2 DM should encompass a more 
nuanced approach. Cardiovascular risk is lower and not equivalent in 
a  younger  individual  with  a  brief  duration  of  type  2  DM  compared 
to  an  older  individual  with  long-standing  type  2  DM.  In  individuals 
without  a  known  diagnosis  of  diabetes,  elevated  HbA1c  is  predictive 
not  just  of  diabetes  risk  but  also  risk  of  CHD,  stroke,  and  all-cause 
mortality.  Because  of  the  extremely  high  prevalence  of  underlying 
CVD in individuals with diabetes (especially in type 2 DM), evidence 
of  atherosclerotic  vascular  disease  (e.g.,  cardiac  stress  test)  should 
be  sought  in  an  individual  with  diabetes  who  has  symptoms,  even  if 
atypical, suggestive of cardiac ischemia or peripheral or carotid arterial 
disease. The screening of asymptomatic individuals with diabetes for 
CHD is not recommended or cost-effective. The absence of chest pain 
(“silent ischemia”) is common in individuals with diabetes, and a thor-
ough cardiac evaluation should be considered prior to major surgical 
procedures.

The  increase  in  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  rates  in 
diabetes  appears  to  relate  to  the  synergism  of  hyperglycemia  with 
other  cardiovascular  risk  factors  such  as  dyslipidemia  (elevated  trig-
lycerides,  low  high-density  lipoprotein  [HDL]  cholesterol  and  small 
dense low-density lipoprotein [LDL]), hypertension, obesity, reduced 
physical  activity,  and  cigarette  smoking.  Additional  risk  factors  that 
are  prevalent  include  CKD  (albuminuria,  reduced  GFR),  abnormal 
platelet function, increased markers of inflammation, and endothelial 
dysfunction. The results of the ACCORD trial and VADT trial, which 
demonstrated that tight glucose control had limited benefit on cardio-
vascular outcomes in individuals with established cardiovascular dis-
ease, suggesting the importance of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.

TREATMENT
Cardiovascular Disease

Treatment of coronary disease in individuals with DM has substan-
tial overlap with treatment in individuals without DM (Chap. 273). 
Revascularization  procedures  for  CHD,  including  percutaneous 
coronary interventions (PCIs) and coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG),  may  be  less  efficacious  in  individuals  with  DM.  Initial 
success rates of PCI in individuals with DM are similar to those in 
the nondiabetic population, but higher rates of restenosis and lower 
long-term  patency  and  survival  rates  have  been  reported.  CABG 
plus optimal medical management likely has better outcomes than 
PCI for individuals with diabetes.

Aggressive  cardiovascular  risk  modification  in  all  individuals 
with  DM  and  glycemic  control  should  be  individualized,  as  dis-
cussed in Chap. 404. In patients with known CHD and type 2 DM, 
an  ACE  inhibitor  or  ARB,  a  statin,  and  acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA; 
aspirin) should be considered. Beta blockers can be used in indi-
viduals  with  diabetes  after  MI.  In  patients  with  CHF,  thiazolidin-
ediones should not be used (Chap. 404). However, metformin can 
be used in patients with stable CHF if the renal function is normal. 
Some  newer  glucose-lowering  therapies  also  have  cardiovascular 
benefit, including the GLP-1 analogues liraglutide (LEADER trial), 
semaglutide  (SUSTAIN-6  trial),  and  dulaglutide  (REWIND  trial) 
and  the  SGLT-2  inhibitors  empagliflozin  (EMPA-REG  trial)  and 
canagliflozin  (CANVAS  trial).  All  SGLT-2  inhibitors  have  been 
shown to exhibit benefits on prevention of CHF exacerbations. A 
possible  increased  risk  of  lower  limb  amputation  and  Fournier’s 
gangrene has been reported with SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy.

Antiplatelet  therapy  reduces  cardiovascular  events  in  individ-
uals  with  DM  who  have  CHD  and  is  recommended.  The  ADA 
recommends considering the use of aspirin for primary prevention 
of coronary events in individuals  with diabetes with an increased 
cardiovascular  risk  (>50  years  old  with  at  least  one  risk  factor 

such  as  hypertension,  dyslipidemia,  smoking,  family  history,  or 
albuminuria).  ASA  is  not  recommended  for  primary  prevention 
in  those  with  a  low  cardiovascular  risk  (<50  years  old  with  no 
risk  factors).  The  aspirin  dose  is  the  same  as  in  nondiabetic   
individuals.

Cardiovascular  Risk  Factors  •  DYSLIPIDEMIA 
Individuals 
with  DM  may  have  several  forms  of  dyslipidemia  (Chap.  407). 
Because  of  the  additive  cardiovascular  risk  of  hyperglycemia  and 
hyperlipidemia,  lipid  abnormalities  should  be  assessed  aggressively 
and treated as part of comprehensive diabetes care (Chap. 404). The 
most  common  pattern  of  dyslipidemia  is  hypertriglyceridemia  and 
reduced HDL cholesterol levels. DM itself does not increase levels of 
LDL, but the small dense LDL particles found in type 2 DM are more 
atherogenic  because  they  are  more  easily  glycated  and  susceptible  to 
oxidation.

Almost  all  treatment  studies  of  diabetic  dyslipidemia  have  been 
performed in individuals with type 2 DM because of the greater fre-
quency of dyslipidemia in this form of diabetes. Interventional studies 
have shown that the beneficial effects of LDL reduction with statins are 
similar  in  the  diabetic  and  nondiabetic  populations.  No  prospective 
studies  have  addressed  similar  questions  in  individuals  with  type  1 
DM. Because the frequency of CVD is low in children and young adults 
with diabetes, assessment of cardiovascular risk should be incorporated 
into the guidelines discussed below.

Based on the guidelines provided by the ADA, all individuals with 
diabetes  should  be  advised  about  lifestyle  modification,  including 
diet, weight loss, and increased physical activity (Chap. 404). If indi-
viduals  with  diabetes  have  elevated  triglyceride  levels  (>1.7  mmol/L 
[150  mg/dL])  or  low  HDL  cholesterol  (<1  mmol/L  [40  mg/dL]  in 
men and <1.3 mmol/L [50 mg/dL] in women), lifestyle modification 
and improved glycemic control should be further emphasized. If trig-
lycerides  remain  >5.7  mmol/L  (500  mg/dL),  treatment  with  fish  oil, 
fibrate drugs, and icosapent may reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Icosa-
pent additionally lowers CHD risk.

In  terms  of  pharmacologic  therapy,  the  ADA  recommends  the 
following:  (1)  all  patients  with  diabetes  and  atherosclerotic  cardio-
vascular  disease  should  receive  high-intensity  statin  therapy;  (2)  in 
patients  aged  40–75  years  without  cardiovascular  disease,  consider 
moderate-intensity statin therapy to target LDL cholesterol <100 mg/
dL  (without  additional  risk  factors)  or  high-intensity  statin  therapy 
to  target  LDL  cholesterol  <70  mg/dL  (with  additional  risk  factors); 
and (3) in patients aged 20–39 years with additional risk factors, con-
sider moderate-intensity statin therapy. Screening for coronary artery 
calcification by electron beam computed tomography (CT) scan that 
noninvasively  detects  the  presence  of  coronary  artery  atherosclerosis 
may help guide treatment initiation or intensity in equivocal cases or 
ambivalent  patients.  Atorvastatin  and  rosuvastatin  are  generally  well 
tolerated if started at lower doses and titrated up to meet lipid goals. 
Atorvastatin  is  the  statin  of  choice  in  patients  with  renal  disease.  If 
statin intolerant or the LDL cholesterol goal is not met, consider the 
addition  of  ezetimibe  or  a  PCSK9  inhibitor  (Chap.  407).  Icosapent 
results in cardiovascular risk reduction on top of statin treatment and 
may have a larger benefit in diabetic individuals. Statin usage is associ-
ated with a mild increase in the risk of developing type 2 DM. This risk 
is greatest in individuals with other risk factors for type 2 DM (Chap. 
403). However, the cardiovascular benefits of statin use outweigh the 
mildly increased risk of diabetes. Niacin use is associated with an even 
greater  increased  risk  for  type  2  DM  or  worsening  glycemic  control 
and is not recommended because of a lack of improvement in cardio-
vascular outcomes.

In  individuals  with  type  2  DM  and  kidney  disease  or  type  2  DM 
and  atherosclerotic  cardiovascular  disease  or  multiple  atherosclerotic 
risk  factors,  the  ADA  recommends  an  SGLT-2  inhibitor  or  GLP-1 
receptor agonist as a second-line agent after metformin. In individuals 
with type 2 DM and heart failure (reduced ejection fraction), the ADA 
recommends  an  SGLT-2  inhibitor.  Individuals  with  atherosclerotic

cardiovascular disease and type 1 or type 2 DM should be treated with 
an  ACE  inhibitor  or  angiotensin  receptor  blocker  and  beta  blockers 
and antiplatelet therapy, as in the nondiabetic population (Chap. 273).

HYPERTENSION  Hypertension  can  accelerate  other  complications  of 
DM, particularly CVD, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Blood pressure 
should be measured at every clinic visit. In targeting a goal of blood 
pressure  of  <140/90  mmHg,  therapy  should  first  emphasize  lifestyle 
modifications  such  as  weight  loss,  exercise,  stress  management,  and 
sodium restriction. The blood pressure goal should be individualized. 
In  some  younger  individuals  or  those  with  increased  cardiovascular 
risk,  the  provider  may  target  a  blood  pressure  of  <130/80  mmHg. 
Realizing  that  more  than  one  agent  is  usually  required  to  reach  the 
blood pressure goal, the ADA recommends that all patients with dia-
betes and hypertension be treated with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB 
initially.  Subsequently,  agents  that  reduce  cardiovascular  risk  (beta 
blockers, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers) should be 
incorporated  into  the  regimen.  ACE  inhibitors  and  ARBs  are  likely 
equivalent in most patients with diabetes and renal disease but should 
not  be  combined.  The  addition  of  a  potassium-sparing  diuretic  or 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist can help achieve blood pressure 
targets in refractory cases. Serum potassium and renal function should 
be monitored.

Because  of  the  high  prevalence  of  atherosclerotic  disease  in  indi-
viduals with type 2 DM, the possibility of renovascular hypertension 
should be considered when the blood pressure is not readily controlled.

 ■ LOWER EXTREMITY COMPLICATIONS
DM is the leading cause of nontraumatic lower extremity amputation 
in the United States. Foot ulcers and infections are also a major source 
of  morbidity  in  individuals  with  DM.  The  reasons  for  the  increased 
incidence of these disorders in DM involve the interaction of several 
pathogenic  factors:  neuropathy,  abnormal  foot  biomechanics,  PAD, 
and poor wound healing. The peripheral sensory neuropathy interferes 
with normal protective mechanisms and allows the patient to sustain 
major or repeated minor trauma to the foot, often without knowledge 
of  the  injury.  Disordered  proprioception  causes  abnormal  weight 
bearing  while  walking  and  subsequent  formation  of  callus  or  ulcer-
ation.  Motor  and  sensory  neuropathy  lead  to  abnormal  foot  muscle 
mechanics  and  to  structural  changes  in  the  foot  (hammer  toe,  claw 
toe deformity, prominent metatarsal heads, Charcot joint). Autonomic 
neuropathy results in anhidrosis and altered superficial blood flow in 
the foot, which promote drying of the skin and fissure formation. PAD 
and poor wound healing impede resolution of minor breaks in the skin, 
allowing them to enlarge and to become infected.

Many individuals with DM develop a foot ulcer (great toe or meta-
tarsophalangeal areas are most common), and a significant subset who 
develop  an  ulceration  will  ultimately  undergo  amputation  (14–24% 
risk  with  that  ulcer  or  subsequent  ulceration).  Risk  factors  for  foot 
ulcers or amputation include male sex, diabetes for >10 years, periph-
eral  neuropathy,  abnormal  structure  of  foot  (bony  abnormalities, 
callus,  thickened  nails),  PAD,  smoking,  history  of  previous  ulcer  or 
amputation,  visual  impairment,  poor  glycemic  control,  and  diabetic 
nephropathy, especially dialysis. Large calluses are often precursors to 
or  overlie  ulcerations.  Aggressive  treatment  of  LDL  cholesterol  with 
the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab has been shown to reduce the risk of 
future major adverse limb events in patients with PAD.

TREATMENT
Lower Extremity Complications

The  optimal  therapy  for  foot  ulcers  and  amputations  is  preven-
tion  through  identification  of  high-risk  patients,  education  of  the 
patient, and institution of measures to prevent ulceration. High-risk 
patients should be identified during the routine, annual foot exami-
nation performed on all patients with DM (see “Ongoing Aspects of 
Comprehensive Diabetes Care” in Chap. 404). If the monofilament 

test or one of the other tests is abnormal, the patient is diagnosed 
with  LOPS  (Chap.  403).  Providers  should  consider  screening  for 
asymptomatic PAD in individuals >50 years of age who have dia-
betes  and  other  risk  factors  using  ankle-brachial  index  testing 
(Chap. 281). Patient education should emphasize (1) careful selec-
tion of footwear, (2) daily inspection of the feet to detect early signs 
of  poor-fitting  footwear  or  minor  trauma,  (3)  daily  foot  hygiene 
to  keep  the  skin  clean  and  moist,  (4)  avoidance  of  self-treatment 
of  foot  abnormalities  and  high-risk  behavior  (e.g.,  walking  bare-
foot), and (5) prompt consultation with a health care provider if an 
abnormality arises. Calluses and nail deformities should be treated 
by  a  podiatrist.  Interventions  directed  at  risk  factor  modification 
include  orthotic  shoes  and  devices,  callus  management,  nail  care, 
and prophylactic measures to reduce increased skin pressure from 
abnormal bony architecture. Attention to other risk factors for vas-
cular disease (smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension) and improved 
glycemic control are also important.

Despite  preventive  measures,  foot  ulceration  and  infection  are 
common and represent a serious problem. Due to the multifacto-
rial  pathogenesis  of  lower  extremity  ulcers,  management  of  these 
lesions is multidisciplinary and often demands expertise in ortho-
pedics,  vascular  surgery,  endocrinology,  podiatry,  and  infectious 
diseases. The plantar surface of the foot is the most common site of 
ulceration.  Ulcers  may  be  primarily  neuropathic  (no  accompany-
ing infection) or may have surrounding cellulitis or osteomyelitis. 
Cellulitis without ulceration should be treated with antibiotics that 
provide broad-spectrum coverage (see below).

An  infected  ulcer  is  a  clinical  diagnosis,  because  superficial 
culture of any ulceration will likely find multiple bacterial species 
of unknown significance. The infection surrounding the foot ulcer 
may  be  due  to  multiple  organisms,  with  aerobic  gram-positive 
cocci (staphylococci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus [MRSA], group A and B streptococci) being most common 
and with aerobic gram-negative bacilli and/or obligate anaerobes as 
co-pathogens.

Gas gangrene may develop in the absence of clostridial infection. 
Cultures should be obtained from the debrided ulcer base or from 
purulent drainage or aspiration of the wound. Wound depth should 
be determined by inspection and probing with a blunt-tipped sterile 
instrument.  A  wound  that  probes  to  the  bone  represents  clinical 
evidence of osteomyelitis. Plain radiographs of the foot should be 
performed to assess the possibility of osteomyelitis in chronic ulcers 
that  have  not  responded  to  therapy.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging 
(MRI)  is  the  most  specific  modality,  with  nuclear  medicine  scans 
and labeled white cell studies as alternatives. Surgical debridement 
is often necessary.

Osteomyelitis  is  best  treated  by  a  combination  of  prolonged 
antibiotics  and  debridement  of  infected  bone  when  possible.  The 
possible  contribution  of  vascular  insufficiency  should  be  consid-
ered in all patients. Peripheral arterial bypass procedures are often 
effective in promoting wound healing and in decreasing the need 
for amputation of the ischemic limb (Chap. 281).

Interventions with demonstrated efficacy in diabetic foot ulcers 
or  wounds  include  the  following:  (1)  off-loading,  (2)  debride-
ment,  (3)  wound  dressings,  (4)  appropriate  use  of  antibiotics,  (5) 
revascularization,  and  (6)  limited  amputation.  Off-loading  is  the 
complete avoidance of weight bearing on the ulcer, which removes 
the mechanical trauma that retards wound healing. Bed rest and a 
variety of orthotic devices or contact casting limit weight bearing 
on wounds or pressure points. Surgical debridement is important 
and effective, but the efficacy of other modalities for wound healing 
(enzymes,  growth  factors,  cellular  therapy,  hyperbaric  oxygen)  is 
unclear. Dressings such as hydrocolloid dressings promote wound 
healing by creating a moist environment, controlling the exudate, 
and  protecting  the  wound.  Antiseptic  agents  should  be  avoided. 
Topical antibiotics are of limited value. Referral for physical ther-
apy, orthotic evaluation, and rehabilitation should occur once the 
infection is controlled.

Mild  or  non-limb-threatening  infections  can  be  treated  with 
oral  antibiotics  directed  predominantly  at  methicillin-susceptible 
staphylococci  and  streptococci  (e.g.,  dicloxacillin,  cephalosporin, 
amoxicillin/clavulanate). However, in patients with a prior history 
of MRSA or in locations with a high prevalence of MRSA, treatment 
with clindamycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
is  preferred.  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  exhibits  less  reliable 
coverage  of  streptococci  than  the  β-lactams,  and  individuals  with 
diabetes may develop adverse effects including acute kidney injury 
and  hyperkalemia.  Surgical  debridement  of  necrotic  tissue,  local 
wound  care  (avoidance  of  weight  bearing  over  the  ulcer),  and 
close  surveillance  for  progression  of  infection  are  crucial.  More 
severe  infections  require  IV  antibiotics  as  well  as  offloading  and 
local  wound  care.  Urgent  surgical  debridement  may  be  required. 
Optimization  of  glycemic  control  should  be  a  goal.  IV  antibiotics 
should provide broad-spectrum coverage directed toward S. aureus, 
including MRSA, streptococci, gram-negative aerobes, and anaer-
obic  bacteria.  Initial  antimicrobial  regimens  include  vancomycin 
plus a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor or carbapenem, or vancomy-
cin plus a quinolone with metronidazole. In some cases, daptomy-
cin, ceftaroline, or linezolid may be substituted for vancomycin in 
consultation  with  an  Infectious  Diseases  expert.  If  the  infection 
surrounding  the  ulcer  is  not  improving  with  IV  antibiotics,  reas-
sessment  of  antibiotic  coverage  and  reconsideration  of  the  need 
for  surgical  debridement  or  revascularization  are  indicated.  With 
clinical improvement, oral antibiotics and local wound care can be 
continued on an outpatient basis with close follow-up.

 ■ INFECTIONS
Individuals with DM have a greater frequency and severity of infection. 
The reasons for this include incompletely defined abnormalities in cell-
mediated immunity and phagocyte function associated with hypergly-
cemia, as well as diminished vascularization. Hyperglycemia aids the 
colonization and growth of a variety of organisms (Candida and other 
fungal  species).  Many  common  infections  are  more  frequent  and 
severe in the diabetic population, whereas several rare infections are 
seen almost exclusively in the diabetic population. Examples of this 
latter  category  include  rhinocerebral  mucormycosis,  emphysematous 
infections  of  the  gallbladder  and  urinary  tract,  and  “malignant”  or 
invasive  otitis  externa.  Invasive  otitis  externa  is  usually  secondary  to 
Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  infection  in  the  soft  tissue  surrounding  the 
external  auditory  canal,  usually  begins  with  pain  and  discharge,  and 
may rapidly progress to osteomyelitis and meningitis. These infections 
should  be  sought,  in  particular,  in  patients  presenting  with  severe 
hyperglycemia (Chap. 404).

Pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infec-
tions are all more common in the diabetic population. In general, the 
organisms that cause pulmonary infections are similar to those found 
in  the  nondiabetic  population;  however,  gram-negative  organisms,  
S.  aureus,  and  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  are  more  frequent  patho-
gens. Adults with DM should receive vaccination against pneumococ-
cus, annually against influenza, and now also against the coronavirus 
SARS-CoV-2,  which  causes  increased  morbidity  and  mortality  in 
obese  individuals  and  patients  with  DM  (Chap.  199).  In  addition  to 
early antibiotic therapy for presumed bacterial infections, patients with 
DM should be considered for early intervention with antiviral agents 
(e.g.,  against  influenza  in  flu  or  varicella-zoster  virus  in  shingles)  or 
with  monoclonal  antibodies  in  COVID-19.  Urinary  tract  infections 
(either  lower  tract  or  pyelonephritis)  are  the  result  of  common  bac-
terial  agents  such  as  Escherichia  coli,  although  several  yeast  species 
(e.g., Candida albicans and Candida glabrata) are commonly observed. 
Complications of urinary tract infections include emphysematous pye-
lonephritis and emphysematous cystitis. Bacteriuria occurs frequently 

in  individuals  with  diabetic  cystopathy  and  does  not  require  antibi-
otic  therapy  except  in  specific  circumstances  such  as  pregnancy  or  a 
planned urologic procedure. Susceptibility to furunculosis, superficial 
candidal  infections,  and  vulvovaginitis  are  increased.  Poor  glycemic 
control is a common denominator in individuals with these infections. 
Individuals with diabetes have an increased rate of colonization of S. 
aureus in the skinfolds and nares. Individuals with diabetes also have 
a greater risk of postoperative wound infections that may be mitigated 
by perioperative protocols for insulin administration to maintain gly-
cemic control.

 ■ DERMATOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS
The most common skin manifestations of DM are xerosis and pruritus 
and are usually relieved by skin moisturizers. Protracted wound heal-
ing and skin ulcerations are also frequent complications. Diabetic der-
mopathy,  sometimes  termed  pigmented  pretibial  papules,  or  “diabetic 
skin spots,” begins as an erythematous macule or papule that evolves 
into an area of circular hyperpigmentation. These lesions result from 
minor mechanical trauma in the pretibial region and are more com-
mon in elderly men with DM. Bullous diseases, such as bullosa diabe-
ticorum  (shallow  ulcerations  or  erosions  in  the  pretibial  region),  are 
also seen. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is an uncommon disorder, 
accompanying diabetes in predominantly young women. This usually 
begins in the pretibial region as an erythematous plaque or papules that 
gradually enlarge, darken, and develop irregular margins, with atrophic 
centers  and  central  ulceration.  They  are  often  painful.  Vitiligo  and 
alopecia areata occur at increased frequency in individuals with type 
1 DM. Acanthosis nigricans (hyperpigmented velvety plaques seen on 
the neck, axilla, or extensor surfaces) is sometimes a feature of severe 
insulin  resistance  and  accompanying  diabetes.  Generalized  or  local-
ized  granuloma  annulare  (erythematous  plaques  on  the  extremities 
or trunk), lichen planus (violaceous papules on the cutaneous surface 
with or without erosions in the mouth and genitalia), and scleredema 
(areas  of  skin  thickening  on  the  back  or  neck  at  the  site  of  previous 
superficial  infections)  are  more  common  in  the  diabetic  population. 
Lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy can occur at insulin injection sites but 
are now unusual with the use of human insulin and avoided by rotating 
injection sites.

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolism406 Hypoglycemia

Stephen N. Davis, Philip E. Cryer

Hypoglycemia is most commonly caused by insulin or insulin-producing 
drugs  used  to  treat  diabetes  mellitus  or  by  exposure  to  other  drugs, 
including  alcohol.  However,  a  number  of  other  disorders,  including 
critical  organ  failure,  sepsis  and  inanition,  hormone  deficiencies, 
non-β-cell  tumors,  insulinoma,  and  prior  gastric  surgery,  can  cause 
hypoglycemia  (Table  406-1).  Hypoglycemia  may  be  documented  by 
Whipple’s triad: (1) symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, (2) a low 
plasma glucose concentration measured with a precise method, and (3) 
relief of symptoms after the plasma glucose level is raised. The lower 
limit of the fasting plasma glucose concentration is normally ~70 mg/dL 
(~3.9  mmol/L),  but  lower  venous  glucose  levels  occur  normally,  late 
after a meal, during pregnancy, and during prolonged fasting (>24 h). 
Severe hypoglycemia can cause serious morbidity and increase the risk 
for serious cardiovascular events and mortality during and after the ini-
tial hypoglycemic episode. It should be considered in any patient with 
episodes of confusion, an altered level of consciousness, or a seizure.

 ■ SYSTEMIC GLUCOSE BALANCE AND  
GLUCOSE COUNTERREGULATION
Glucose is an obligate metabolic fuel for the brain under physiologic 
conditions.  The  brain  cannot  synthesize  glucose  or  store  more  than 
a  few  minutes’  supply  as  glycogen  and  therefore  requires  a  contin-
uous  supply  of  glucose  from  the  arterial  circulation.  As  the  arterial 
plasma glucose concentration falls below the physiologic range, blood-
to-brain  glucose  transport  becomes  insufficient  to  support  brain 
energy metabolism and function. However, multiple integrated glucose

counterregulatory  mechanisms  normally  prevent  or  rapidly  correct 
hypoglycemia.

Plasma  glucose  concentrations  are  normally  maintained  within  a 
relatively  narrow  range—roughly  70–110  mg/dL  (3.9–6.1  mmol/L) 
in  the  fasting  state,  with  transient  higher  excursions  after  a  meal—
despite wide variations in exogenous glucose delivery from meals and 
in endogenous glucose utilization by, for example, exercising muscle. 
Between  meals  and  during  fasting,  plasma  glucose  levels  are  main-
tained by endogenous glucose production, hepatic glycogenolysis, and 
hepatic  (and  renal)  gluconeogenesis  (Fig.  406-1).  Although  hepatic 
glycogen stores are usually sufficient to maintain plasma glucose levels 
for ~8 h, this period can be shorter if glucose demand is increased by 
exercise or if glycogen stores are depleted by illness or starvation.

Gluconeogenesis normally requires low insulin levels and the pres-
ence  of  anti-insulin  (counterregulatory)  hormones  together  with  a 
coordinated  supply  of  precursors  from  muscle  and  adipose  tissue  to 
the liver and kidneys. Muscle provides lactate, pyruvate, alanine, gluta-
mine, and other amino acids. Triglycerides in adipose tissue are broken 
down into fatty acids and glycerol, which is a gluconeogenic precursor. 
Fatty acids provide an alternative oxidative fuel to tissues other than the 
brain (which requires glucose).

Systemic  glucose  balance,  maintenance  of  the  normal  plasma 
glucose  concentration,  is  accomplished  by  a  network  of  hormones, 
neural signals, and substrate effects that regulate endogenous glucose 
production  and  glucose  utilization  by  tissues  other  than  the  brain 
(Chap. 403). Among the regulatory factors, insulin plays a dominant 
role (Table 406-2; Fig. 406-1). As plasma glucose levels decline within 
the  physiologic  range,  pancreatic  β-cell  insulin  secretion  decreases, 
thereby  increasing  hepatic  glycogenolysis  and  hepatic  (and  renal) 
gluconeogenesis. Low insulin levels also reduce glucose utilization in 
peripheral tissues, inducing lipolysis and proteolysis and consequently 
releasing gluconeogenic precursors. Thus, a decrease in insulin secre-
tion is the first defense against hypoglycemia.

As  plasma  glucose  levels  decline  just  below  the  physiologic  range, 
glucose  counterregulatory  (plasma  glucose–raising)  hormones  are 
released (Table 406-2; Fig. 406-1). Among these, pancreatic α-cell glu-
cagon and adrenomedullary epinephrine play a primary role. Glucagon 
stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Adrenomedul-
lary  epinephrine  also  stimulates  hepatic  glycogenolysis  and  glucone-
ogenesis  (and  renal  gluconeogenesis)  but  limits  peripheral  uptake  of 
glucose and stimulates lipolysis with production of glycerol and fatty 
acids. Epinephrine becomes critical when glucagon is deficient. When 
hypoglycemia is prolonged beyond ~4 h, cortisol and growth hormone 
also  support  glucose  production  and  restrict  glucose  utilization  to  a 
limited  amount  (both  mechanisms  are  reduced  by  ~80%  compared 
to  epinephrine).  Thus,  cortisol  and  growth  hormone  play  no  role  in 
defense against acute hypoglycemia.

As  plasma  glucose  levels  fall  further,  symptoms  prompt  behav-
ioral  defense  against  hypoglycemia,  including  the  ingestion  of  food 
(Table  406-2;  Fig.  406-1).  The  normal  glycemic  thresholds  for  these 
responses  to  decreasing  plasma  glucose  concentrations  are  shown  in 
Table  406-2.  However,  these  thresholds  are  dynamic.  They  shift  to 
higher-than-normal  glucose  levels  in  people  with  poorly  controlled 
diabetes, who can experience symptoms of hypoglycemia when their 
glucose  levels  decline  toward  the  normal  range.  On  the  other  hand, 
thresholds  shift  to  lower-than-normal  glucose  levels  in  people  with 
recurrent hypoglycemia; i.e., patients with intensively treated diabetes 
or an insulinoma have symptoms at glucose levels lower than those that 
cause symptoms in healthy individuals.

Clinical  Manifestations  Neuroglycopenic  manifestations  of 
hypoglycemia  are  the  direct  result  of  central  nervous  system  glucose 
deprivation.  These  features  include  behavioral  changes,  confusion, 
fatigue,  seizure,  loss  of  consciousness,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  and,  if 
hypoglycemia  is  severe,  death.  Neurogenic  (or  autonomic)  manifes-
tations  of  hypoglycemia  result  from  the  perception  of  physiologic 
changes caused by the central nervous system–mediated sympathoad-
renal discharge that is triggered by hypoglycemia. They include adren-
ergic  symptoms  (mediated  largely  by  norepinephrine  released  from

anxiety,  as  well  as  cholinergic  symptoms  (mediated  by  acetylcholine 
released from sympathetic postganglionic neurons), such as sweating, 
hunger,  and  paresthesias.  Clearly,  these  are  nonspecific  symptoms. 
Their  attribution  to  hypoglycemia  requires  that  the  corresponding 
plasma  glucose  concentration  be  low  and  that  the  symptoms  resolve 
after the glucose level is raised (as delineated by Whipple’s triad).

Common  signs  of  hypoglycemia  include  diaphoresis  and  pallor. 
Heart rate and systolic blood pressure are typically increased but may 
not  be  raised  in  an  individual  who  has  experienced  repeated,  recent 
episodes  of  hypoglycemia.  Neuroglycopenic  manifestations  are  often 
observable. Transient focal neurologic deficits occur occasionally. Per-
manent neurologic deficits are rare.

Etiology  and  Pathophysiology  Hypoglycemia  activates  proin-
flammatory,  procoagulant,  and  proatherothrombotic  responses  in 
type  1  diabetes  mellitus  (T1DM),  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM), 

and nondiabetic individuals. These responses increase platelet aggre-
gation,  reduce  fibrinolytic  balance  (increase  plasminogen  activator 
inhibitor-1),  and  increase  intravascular  coagulation.  Hypoglycemia 
also  reduces  protective  nitric  oxide–mediated  arterial  vasodilator 
mechanisms in healthy, T1DM, and T2DM individuals.

 ■ HYPOGLYCEMIA IN DIABETES
Impact and Frequency  Hypoglycemia is the limiting factor in the 
glycemic  management  of  diabetes  mellitus.  First,  it  causes  recurrent 
morbidity  in  most  people  with  T1DM  and  in  many  with  advanced 
T2DM,  and  it  is  sometimes  fatal.  Second,  it  precludes  maintenance 
of euglycemia over a lifetime of diabetes and, thus, full realization of 
the well-established microvascular benefits of glycemic control. Third, 
it  causes  a  vicious  cycle  of  recurrent  hypoglycemia  by  producing 
hypoglycemia-associated  autonomic  failure—i.e.,  the  clinical  syn-
dromes  of  defective  glucose  counterregulation  and  of  hypoglycemia  
unawareness.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismHypoglycemia is a fact of life for people with T1DM if treated with 
insulin,  sulfonylurea,  or  glinides.  They  suffer  an  average  of  two  epi-
sodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia per week and at least one episode 
of  severe,  at  least  temporarily  disabling  hypoglycemia  each  year.  An 
estimated 6–10% of people with T1DM die as a result of hypoglycemia. 
The incidence of hypoglycemia is lower in T2DM than in T1DM. How-
ever,  its  prevalence  in  insulin-requiring  T2DM  is  surprisingly  high. 
Recent studies have revealed a hypoglycemia prevalence approaching 
70%.  In  fact,  as  patients  with  T2DM  outnumber  those  with  T1DM 
by ten- to twentyfold, the prevalence of hypoglycemia is now greater 
in  T2DM.  Hypoglycemia  can  occur  at  any  hemoglobin  A1c  (HbA1C) 
level.  Although  severe  hypoglycemia  occurs  twice  as  frequently  at 
lower  HbA1C  levels  in  T1DM,  it  still  occurs  at  HbA1C  levels  >8%.  In 
insulin-requiring  T2DM,  severe  hypoglycemia  can  occur  at  lower 
HbA1C  values  but  also  importantly  at  values  of  8–10%.  Severe  hypo-
glycemia  in  T2DM  carries  an  increased  risk  of  severe  cardiovascular 
and  cerebrovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  for  up  to  1  year  after 
the event. The risk of severe hypoglycemia and a subsequent cardio-
vascular  adverse  event  is,  in  fact,  relatively  increased  when  trying  to 
improve glucose control in some T2DM individuals with persistently 
raised HbA1C values. Therefore, improvements in glycemic control in 
these  individuals  should  be  performed  incrementally  and  carefully 
to avoid episodes of hypoglycemia. Insulin, sulfonylureas, or glinides 
can  cause  hypoglycemia  in  T2DM.  Metformin,  thiazolidinediones, 
α-glucosidase  inhibitors,  glucagon-like  peptide  1  (GLP-1)  receptor 
agonists,  sodium-glucose  cotransporter-2  inhibitors,  and  dipeptidyl 
peptidase  IV  (DPP-IV)  inhibitors  do  not  cause  hypoglycemia.  How-
ever, they increase the risk when combined with a sulfonylurea, glinide, 
or insulin. Notably, the frequency of hypoglycemia approaches that in 
T1DM as persons with T2DM develop absolute insulin deficiency and 
require more complex treatment with insulin.

glucagon levels do not increase as plasma glucose levels fall; a second 
defense  against  hypoglycemia  is  lost.  Reduced  glucagon  responses  to 
hypoglycemia also occur in long-duration T2DM. However, pancreatic 
alpha cells that produce glucagon are present in the same number and 
size  in  T1DM  as  compared  to  age-matched  nondiabetic  individuals. 
Thus,  the  defect  that  restricts  glucagon  release  during  hypoglycemia 
in  T1DM  (and  presumably  in  long-standing  T2DM)  appears  to  be 
a  signaling  defect,  as  glucagon  responses  to  other  physiologic  stress 
in  T1DM  (e.g.,  exercise)  are  preserved.  Finally,  the  increase  in  epi-
nephrine levels, the third critical defense against acute hypoglycemia, is 
typically attenuated. The glycemic threshold for the sympathoadrenal 
(adrenomedullary  epinephrine  and  sympathetic  neural  norepineph-
rine) response is shifted to lower plasma glucose concentrations. That 
shift is typically the result of recent antecedent iatrogenic hypoglyce-
mia. In the setting of absent decrements in insulin and of absent incre-
ments  in  glucagon,  the  attenuated  increment  in  epinephrine  causes 
the clinical syndrome of defective glucose counterregulation. Affected 
patients are at ≥25-fold greater risk of severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia 
during intensive glycemic therapy for their diabetes than are patients 
with normal epinephrine responses. This functional—and potentially 
reversible—disorder is distinct from classic diabetic autonomic neur-
opathy, which also includes all of the above pathophysiologic defects, 
and is a structural and irreversible disorder.

HYPOGLYCEMIA  UNAWARENESS  The  attenuated  sympathoadrenal 
response (largely the reduced sympathetic neural response) to hypogly-
cemia causes the clinical syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness—i.e., 
loss of the warning adrenergic and cholinergic symptoms that previ-
ously  allowed  the  patient  to  recognize  developing  hypoglycemia  and 
therefore  to  abort  the  episode  by  ingesting  carbohydrates.  Affected 
patients are at a sixfold increased risk of severe iatrogenic hypoglyce-
mia during intensive glycemic therapy of their diabetes.
HAAF  IN  DIABETES  The  concept  of  HAAF  in  diabetes  posits  that 
recent antecedent iatrogenic hypoglycemia (or sleep or prior exercise) 

Conventional  Risk  Factors  The  conventional  risk  factors  for 
hypoglycemia in diabetes are identified on the basis of relative or abso-
lute insulin excess. This occurs when (1) insulin (or 
insulin  secretagogue)  doses  are  excessive,  ill-timed, 
or  of  the  wrong  type;  (2)  the  influx  of  exogenous 
glucose  is  reduced  (e.g.,  during  an  overnight  fast, 
periods of temporary fasting, or after missed meals 
or  snacks);  (3)  insulin-independent  glucose  utiliza-
tion is increased (e.g., during exercise); (4) sensitivity 
to insulin is increased (e.g., with improved glycemic 
control, in the middle of the night, after exercise, or 
with  increased  fitness  or  weight  loss);  (5)  endoge-
nous glucose production is reduced (e.g., after alco-
hol  ingestion);  and  (6)  insulin  clearance  is  reduced 
(e.g.,  in  renal  failure).  However,  these  conventional 
risk  factors  alone  explain  a  minority  of  episodes; 
other factors are typically involved.

Hypoglycemia-Associated Autonomic Failure 
(HAAF)  While  marked  insulin  excess  alone  can 
cause hypoglycemia, iatrogenic hypoglycemia in dia-
betes  (T1DM  and/or  T2DM)  is  typically  the  result 
of  the  interplay  of  relative  or  absolute  therapeutic 
insulin  excess  and  compromised  physiologic  and 
behavioral  defenses  against  falling  plasma  glucose 
concentrations  (Table  406-2;  Fig.  406-2).  Defective 
glucose  counterregulation  compromises  physiologic 
defense (particularly decrements in insulin and incre-
ments in glucagon and epinephrine), and hypoglyce-
mia  unawareness  compromises  behavioral  defense 
(ingestion of carbohydrate).

DEFECTIVE  GLUCOSE  COUNTERREGULATION  In 
the setting of absolute endogenous insulin deficiency, 
insulin levels do not decrease as plasma glucose lev-
els fall; thus, the first defense against hypoglycemia is 
lost. After a few years of disease duration in T1DM,

3132 causes both defective glucose counterregulation (by reducing the epi-
nephrine response to a given level of subsequent hypoglycemia in the 
setting  of  absent  insulin  and  glucagon  responses)  and  hypoglycemia 
unawareness  (by  reducing  the  sympathoadrenal  response  to  a  given 
level  of  subsequent  hypoglycemia).  These  impaired  responses,  which 
can occur in individuals with either T1DM or T2DM, create a vicious 
cycle of recurrent iatrogenic hypoglycemia (Fig. 406-2). Hypoglycemia 
unawareness  and,  to  some  limited  extent,  the  reduced  epinephrine 
component of defective glucose counterregulation can be reversible by 
as little as 2–3 weeks of scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia in most 
affected patients.

On  the  basis  of  this  pathophysiology,  additional  risk  factors  for 
hypoglycemia  in  diabetes  include  (1)  absolute  insulin  deficiency, 
indicating that insulin levels will not decrease and glucagon levels will 
not increase as plasma glucose levels fall; (2) a history of severe hypo-
glycemia or of hypoglycemia unawareness, implying recent antecedent 
hypoglycemia,  as  well  as  prior  exercise  or  sleep,  indicating  that  the 
sympathoadrenal response will be attenuated; (3) impaired renal func-
tion resulting in reduced clearance of exogenous and endogenous insu-
lin; (4) classical diabetic autonomic neuropathy; and (5) lower HbA1C 
or lower glycemic goals even at elevated HbA1C levels (8–10%), as they 
represent an increased probability of recent antecedent hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia  Risk  Factor  Reduction  Several  recent,  multi-
center, randomized controlled trials investigating the potential benefits 
of tight glucose control in either inpatient or outpatient settings have 
reported  a  high  prevalence  of  severe  hypoglycemia.  In  the  NICE-
SUGAR  study,  attempts  to  control  in-hospital  plasma  glucose  values 
toward  physiologic  levels  resulted  in  increased  mortality  risk.  The 
ADVANCE  and  ACCORD  studies  and  the  Veterans  Affairs  Diabetes 
Trial (VADT) also found a significant incidence of severe hypoglyce-
mia among T2DM patients. Severe hypoglycemia with accompanying 
serious  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  also  occurred  in  the 
standard  (e.g.,  not  receiving  intensified  treatment)  control  group  in 
all of the above studies and in another large study in prediabetic and 
T2DM individuals (ORIGIN). Thus, as stated above, severe hypogly-
cemia  can  and  does  occur  at  HbA1c  values  of  8–10%  in  both  T1DM 
and T2DM. Somewhat surprisingly, all three studies found little or no 
benefit of intensive glucose control to reduce macrovascular events in 
T2DM.  In  fact,  the  ACCORD  study  was  ended  early  because  of  the 
increased mortality rate in the intensive glucose control arm. Whether 
iatrogenic hypoglycemia was the cause of the increased mortality risk is 
not known. In light of these findings, some new recommendations and 
paradigms have been formulated. Whereas there is little debate regard-
ing  the  need  to  reduce  hyperglycemia  in  the  hospital,  the  glycemic 
maintenance goals in critical care settings have been modified to stay 
between 140 and 180 mg/dL. Similar glycemic targets are also recom-
mended in non–critically ill patients by a number of expert societies, 
although some recommend even more strict glucose control down to 
108  mg/dL.  Accordingly,  the  benefits  of  insulin  therapy  and  reduced 
hyperglycemia can be obtained while the prevalence of hypoglycemia 
is reduced.

Similarly, evidence exists that intensive glucose control can reduce 
the  prevalence  of  microvascular  disease  in  both  T1DM  and  T2DM. 
These benefits need to be weighed against the increased prevalence of 
hypoglycemia.  Certainly,  the  level  of  glucose  control  (i.e.,  the  HbA1c 
value,  symptoms  of  hyper-  and  hypoglycemia,  and  home  glucose 
values)  should  be  evaluated  for  each  patient.  Multicenter  trials  have 
demonstrated  that  individuals  with  recently  diagnosed  T1DM  or 
T2DM  can  have  better  glycemic  control  with  less  hypoglycemia.  In 
addition, there is still long-term benefit in reducing HbA1c values from 
higher to lower, albeit still above recommended levels. Perhaps a rea-
sonable therapeutic goal is the lowest HbA1c level that does not cause 
severe hypoglycemia and that preserves awareness of hypoglycemia.

Pancreatic transplantation (both whole organ and islet cell) has been 
used in part as a treatment for severe hypoglycemia. Generally, rates of 
hypoglycemia are reduced after transplantation. This decrease appears 
to  be  due  to  increased  physiologic  insulin  and  glucagon  responses 
during hypoglycemia.

The  use  of  continuous  glucose  monitors  (CGMs),  either  alone  or 
in combination with continuous subcutaneous infusion via a wearable 
pump,  offers  promise  as  a  method  of  reducing  hypoglycemia  while 
improving HbA1c. Specifically, continuous glucose monitoring coupled 
with temporary discontinuation of subcutaneous insulin infusion when 
the monitor predicts a low glucose concentration is particularly promis-
ing. Studies investigating the use of CGM during inpatient care for both 
insulin-requiring pediatric and adult patients with diabetes are ongoing. 
Furthermore, progress utilizing a portable wearable “artificial pancreas” 
incorporating continuous glucose sensor modulation of either insulin 
alone or bi-hormonal delivery of both insulin and glucagon has been 
established. Additionally, stem cell–derived β cells also offer promise of 
novel therapeutic interventions to reduce hypoglycemia.

Other interventions to stimulate counterregulatory responses, such 
as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, β-adrenergic receptor antag-
onists, opiate receptor antagonists, and fructose, remain experimental 
and have not been assessed in large-scale clinical trials.

Thus,  intensive  glycemic  therapy (Chap. 404)  needs  to  be  applied 
along  with  the  patient’s  education  and  empowerment,  frequent  self-
monitoring of blood glucose, flexible insulin (and other drug) regimens 
(including the use of insulin analogues, both short- and longer-acting), 
individualized glycemic goals, and ongoing professional guidance, sup-
port, and consideration of both the conventional risk factors and those 
indicative of compromised glucose counterregulation. Given a history 
of  hypoglycemia  unawareness,  a  2-  to  3-week  period  of  scrupulous 
avoidance of hypoglycemia is indicated.

 ■ HYPOGLYCEMIA WITHOUT DIABETES
There are many causes of hypoglycemia (Table 406-1). Because hypo-
glycemia is common in insulin- or insulin secretagogue–treated diabe-
tes, it is often reasonable to assume that a clinically suspicious episode 
is the result of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, because hypoglyce-
mia is rare in the absence of relevant drug-treated diabetes (pregnancy 
and  during  severe  episodes  of  morning  sickness),  it  is  reasonable  to 
conclude  that  a  hypoglycemic  disorder  is  present  only  in  patients  in 
whom Whipple’s triad can be demonstrated.

Particularly when patients are ill or medicated, the initial diagnostic 
focus should be on the possibility of drug involvement and then on crit-
ical illnesses, hormone deficiency, or non–islet cell tumor hypoglyce-
mia. In the absence of any of these etiologic factors and in a seemingly 
well individual, the focus should shift to possible endogenous hyperin-
sulinism or accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia.

Drugs 
Insulin and insulin secretagogues suppress glucose produc-
tion and stimulate glucose utilization. Ethanol blocks gluconeogenesis 
but not glycogenolysis. Thus, alcohol-induced hypoglycemia typically 
occurs after a several-day ethanol binge during which the person eats 
little  food,  with  consequent  glycogen  depletion.  Ethanol  is  usually 
measurable in blood at the time of presentation, but its levels correlate 
poorly  with  plasma  glucose  concentrations.  Because  gluconeogenesis 
becomes  the  predominant  route  of  glucose  production  during  pro-
longed  hypoglycemia,  alcohol  can  contribute  to  the  progression  of 
hypoglycemia in patients with insulin-treated diabetes.

Many other drugs have been associated with hypoglycemia. These 
include commonly used drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors  and  angiotensin  receptor  antagonists,  β-adrenergic  recep-
tor  antagonists,  quinolone  antibiotics,  indomethacin,  quinine,  and 
sulfonamides.

Critical Illness  Among hospitalized patients, serious illnesses such 
as  renal,  hepatic,  or  cardiac  failure;  sepsis;  and  inanition  are  second 
only to drugs as causes of hypoglycemia.

Rapid and extensive hepatic destruction (e.g., toxic hepatitis) causes 
fasting hypoglycemia because the liver is the major site of endogenous 
glucose  production.  The  mechanism  of  hypoglycemia  in  patients 
with  cardiac  failure  is  unknown.  Hepatic  congestion  and  hypoxia 
may  be  involved.  Although  the  kidneys  are  a  source  of  glucose  pro-
duction, hypoglycemia in patients with renal failure is also caused by 
the  reduced  clearance  of  insulin  (thereby  inappropriately  increasing

insulin relative to the prevailing glucose levels) and the reduced mobi-
lization of gluconeogenic precursors in renal failure.

Sepsis is a relatively common cause of hypoglycemia. Increased glu-
cose utilization is induced by cytokine production in macrophage-rich 
tissues  such  as  the  liver,  spleen,  and  lung.  Hypoglycemia  develops  if 
glucose  production  fails  to  keep  pace.  Cytokine-induced  inhibition 
of gluconeogenesis in the setting of nutritional glycogen depletion, in 
combination with hepatic and renal hypoperfusion, may also contrib-
ute to hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia can be seen with starvation. Due to brain conversion 
and utilization of alternative substrates, such as lactate, pyruvate, and 
ketone  bodies,  there  is  only  a  modest  counterregulatory  neuroendo-
crine and autonomic nervous system response. During periods of pro-
longed starvation (fasting) plasma glucose levels are lower in women as 
compared to men, perhaps because of loss of whole-body fat stores and 
subsequent depletion of gluconeogenic precursors (e.g., amino acids), 
necessitating increased glucose utilization.

Hormone  Deficiencies  Neither  cortisol  nor  growth  hormone  is 
critical  to  the  prevention  of  hypoglycemia,  at  least  in  adults.  None-
theless,  hypoglycemia  can  occur  with  prolonged  fasting  in  patients 
with  primary  adrenocortical  failure  (Addison’s  disease)  or  hypopi-
tuitarism.  Anorexia  and  weight  loss  are  typical  features  of  chronic 
cortisol  deficiency  and  likely  result  in  glycogen  depletion.  Cortisol 
deficiency is associated with impaired gluconeogenesis and low levels 
of  gluconeogenic  precursors;  these  associations  suggest  that  sub-
strate-limited  gluconeogenesis,  in  the  setting  of  glycogen  depletion, 
is  the  cause  of  hypoglycemia.  Growth  hormone  deficiency  can  cause 
hypoglycemia  in  young  children.  In  addition  to  extended  fasting, 
high rates of glucose utilization (e.g., during exercise or in pregnancy) 
or  low  rates  of  glucose  production  (e.g.,  after  alcohol  ingestion)  can 
precipitate  hypoglycemia  in  adults  with  previously  unrecognized  
hypopituitarism.

Hypoglycemia is not a feature of the epinephrine-deficient state that 
results from bilateral adrenalectomy when glucocorticoid replacement 
is adequate, nor does it occur during pharmacologic adrenergic block-
ade when other glucoregulatory systems are intact. Combined deficien-
cies of glucagon and epinephrine play a key role in the pathogenesis of 
iatrogenic  hypoglycemia  in  people  with  insulin-deficient  diabetes,  as 
discussed earlier. Otherwise, deficiencies of these hormones are not usu-
ally considered in the differential diagnosis of a hypoglycemic disorder.

Non–β-Cell  Tumors  Fasting  hypoglycemia,  often  termed  non–
islet cell tumor hypoglycemia, occurs occasionally in patients with large 
mesenchymal  or  epithelial  tumors  (e.g.,  hepatomas,  adrenocortical 
carcinomas, carcinoids). The glucose kinetic patterns resemble those of 
hyperinsulinism (see next), but insulin secretion is suppressed appro-
priately during hypoglycemia. In most instances, hypoglycemia is due 
to  overproduction  of  an  incompletely  processed  form  of  insulin-like 
growth  factor  II  (“big  IGF-II”)  that  does  not  complex  normally  with 
circulating binding proteins and thus more readily gains access to tar-
get tissues. The tumors are usually apparent clinically, plasma ratios of 
IGF-II to IGF-I are high, and free IGF-II levels (and levels of pro-IGF-II 
[1–21]) are elevated. Curative surgery is seldom possible, but reduction 
of  tumor  bulk  may  ameliorate  hypoglycemia.  Therapy  with  a  gluco-
corticoid, growth hormone, or both has also been reported to alleviate 
hypoglycemia.  Hypoglycemia  attributed  to  ectopic  IGF-I  production 
has been reported but is rare.

Endogenous  Hyperinsulinism  Hypoglycemia  due  to  endoge-
nous hyperinsulinism can be caused by (1) a primary β-cell disorder—
typically a β-cell tumor (insulinoma), sometimes multiple insulinomas, 
or a functional β-cell disorder with β-cell hypertrophy or hyperplasia; (2) 
an antibody to insulin or to the insulin receptor; (3) a β-cell secretagogue 
such as a sulfonylurea; or perhaps (4) ectopic insulin secretion, among 
other very rare mechanisms. None of these causes are common.

The  fundamental  pathophysiologic  feature  of  endogenous  hyper-
insulinism caused by a primary β-cell disorder or an insulin secreta-
gogue is the failure of insulin secretion to fall to very low levels during 

hypoglycemia.  This  feature  is  assessed  by  measurement  of  plasma 
insulin,  C-peptide  (the  connecting  peptide  that  is  cleaved  from  pro-
insulin  to  produce  insulin),  proinsulin,  and  glucose  concentrations 
during  hypoglycemia.  Insulin,  C-peptide,  and  proinsulin  levels  need 
not  be  high  relative  to  normal,  euglycemic  values;  rather,  they  are 
inappropriately high in the setting of a low plasma glucose concentra-
tion.  Critical  diagnostic  findings  are  a  plasma  insulin  concentration 
≥3  μU/mL  (≥18  pmol/L),  a  plasma  C-peptide  concentration  ≥0.6  ng/
mL (≥0.2 nmol/L), and a plasma proinsulin concentration ≥5.0 pmol/L 
when the plasma glucose concentration is <55 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L) 
with  symptoms  of  hypoglycemia.  A  low  plasma  β-hydroxybutyrate 
concentration  (≤2.7  mmol/L)  and  an  increment  in  plasma  glucose 
level of >25 mg/dL (>1.4 mmol/L) after IV administration of glucagon  
(1.0 mg) indicate increased insulin (or IGF) actions.

The  diagnostic  strategy  is  (1)  to  measure  plasma  glucose,  insulin, 
C-peptide,  proinsulin,  and  β-hydroxybutyrate  concentrations  and  to 
screen  for  circulating  oral  hypoglycemic  agents  during  an  episode 
of hypoglycemia and (2) to assess symptoms during the episode and 
seek their resolution following correction of hypoglycemia by glucose 
(either oral or parenteral) or by IV injection of glucagon (i.e., to doc-
ument Whipple’s triad). This is straightforward if the patient is hypo-
glycemic  when  seen.  Since  endogenous  hyperinsulinemic  disorders 
usually,  but  not  invariably,  cause  fasting  hypoglycemia,  a  diagnostic 
episode  may  develop  after  a  relatively  short  outpatient  fast.  Serial 
sampling  during  an  inpatient  diagnostic  fast  of  up  to  72  h  or  after  a 
mixed  meal  is  more  problematic.  An  alternative  is  to  give  patients  a 
detailed list of the required measurements and ask them to present to 
an ambulatory care center or emergency room, with the list, during a 
symptomatic episode. Obviously, a normal plasma glucose concentra-
tion during a symptomatic episode indicates that the symptoms are not 
the result of hypoglycemia.

An insulinoma—an insulin-secreting pancreatic islet β-cell tumor—
is the prototypical cause of endogenous hyperinsulinism and therefore 
should  be  sought  in  patients  with  a  compatible  clinical  syndrome. 
However,  insulinoma  is  not  the  only  cause  of  endogenous  hyperin-
sulinism.  Some  patients  with  fasting  endogenous  hyperinsulinemic 
hypoglycemia  have  diffuse  islet  involvement  with  β-cell  hypertrophy 
and  sometimes  hyperplasia.  This  pattern  is  commonly  referred  to  as 
nesidioblastosis, although β-cells budding from ducts are not invariably 
found.  Other  patients  have  a  similar  islet  pattern  but  with  postpran-
dial hypoglycemia, a disorder termed noninsulinoma pancreatogenous 
hypoglycemia.  Post–gastric  bypass  postprandial  hypoglycemia,  which 
most  often  follows  Roux-en-Y  gastric  bypass,  is  also  characterized 
by  diffuse  islet  involvement  and  endogenous  hyperinsulinism.  Mul-
tiple  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  have  been  suggested  including 
exaggerated GLP-1 responses to meals resulting in hyperinsulinemia, 
hypoglucagonemia,  and  hypoglycemia.  However,  other  mechanisms 
may be responsible for the relative hyperinsulinemia, such as reduced 
insulin  clearance  and  reduced  glucagon  responses  to  hypoglycemia. 
The relevant pathogenesis has not been clearly established. However, 
if  medical  treatment  with  agents  such  as  an  α-glucosidase  inhibitor, 
diazoxide, or octreotide fail, partial pancreatectomy may be required. 
Autoimmune  hypoglycemias  include  those  caused  by  an  antibody  to 
insulin  that  binds  postmeal  insulin  and  then  gradually  disassociates, 
with  consequent  late  postprandial  hypoglycemia.  Alternatively,  an 
insulin receptor antibody can function as an agonist. The presence of 
an insulin secretagogue, such as a sulfonylurea or a glinide, results in 
a clinical and biochemical pattern similar to that of an insulinoma but 
can be distinguished by the presence of the circulating secretagogue. 
Finally,  there  are  reports  of  very  rare  phenomena  such  as  ectopic 
insulin  secretion,  a  gain-of-function  insulin  receptor  mutation,  and 
exercise-induced hyperinsulinemia.

Insulinomas are uncommon, with an estimated yearly incidence of 1 
in 250,000. Because >90% of insulinomas are benign, they are a treatable 
cause of potentially fatal hypoglycemia. The median age at presentation 
is 50 years in sporadic cases, but the tumor usually presents in the third 
decade when it is a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 
(Chap. 388). More than 99% of insulinomas are within the substance 
of the pancreas, and the tumors are usually small (<2.0 cm in diameter 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   3133

3134 in 90% of cases). Therefore, they come to clinical attention because of 
hypoglycemia rather than mass effects. CT or MRI detects ~70–80% 
of insulinomas. These methods detect metastases in the roughly 10% 
of patients with a malignant insulinoma. Transabdominal ultrasound 
often  identifies  insulinomas,  and  endoscopic  ultrasound  has  a  sensi-
tivity of ~90%. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is thought to detect 
insulinomas  in  about  half  of  patients.  Selective  pancreatic  arterial 
calcium  injections,  with  the  endpoint  of  a  sharp  increase  in  hepatic 
venous insulin levels, regionalize insulinomas with high sensitivity, but 
this invasive procedure is seldom necessary except to confirm endoge-
nous hyperinsulinism in the diffuse islet disorders. Intraoperative pan-
creatic  ultrasonography  almost  invariably  localizes  insulinomas  that 
are not readily palpable by the surgeon. Surgical resection of a solitary 
insulinoma  is  generally  curative.  Diazoxide,  which  inhibits  insulin 
secretion,  or  the  somatostatin  analogue  octreotide  can  be  used  to 
treat hypoglycemia in patients with unresectable tumors; everolimus, 
an  mTOR  (mammalian  target  of  rapamycin)  inhibitor,  has  also  been 
successful in combination with the above approaches.

 ■ ACCIDENTAL, SURREPTITIOUS,  
OR MALICIOUS HYPOGLYCEMIA
Accidental ingestion of an insulin secretagogue (e.g., as the result of a 
pharmacy or other medical error) or even accidental administration of 
insulin can occur. Factitious hypoglycemia, caused by surreptitious or 
even  malicious  administration  of  insulin  or  an  insulin  secretagogue, 
shares  many  clinical  and  laboratory  features  with  insulinoma.  It  is 
most  common  among  health  care  workers,  patients  with  diabetes  or 
their  relatives,  and  people  with  a  history  of  other  factitious  illnesses. 
However,  it  should  be  considered  in  all  patients  being  evaluated  for 
hypoglycemia  of  obscure  cause.  Ingestion  of  an  insulin  secretagogue 
causes hypoglycemia with increased C-peptide levels, whereas exoge-
nous insulin causes hypoglycemia with low C-peptide levels, reflecting 
suppression of insulin secretion.

Analytical error in the measurement of plasma glucose concentra-
tions  is  rare.  On  the  other  hand,  hand-held  and  continuous  glucose 
monitors  used  to  guide  treatment  of  diabetes  are  not  quantitative 
instruments, particularly at low glucose levels, and should not be used 
for the definitive diagnosis of hypoglycemia. Even with a quantitative 
method, low measured glucose concentrations can be artifactual—e.g., 
the result of continued glucose metabolism by the formed elements of 
the blood ex vivo, particularly in the presence of leukocytosis, erythro-
cytosis,  or  thrombocytosis  or  with  delayed  separation  of  the  serum 
from the formed elements (pseudohypoglycemia).

 ■ INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM  
CAUSING HYPOGLYCEMIA
Nondiabetic  hypoglycemia  also  results  from  inborn  errors  of  metab-
olism. Such hypoglycemia most commonly occurs in infancy but can 
also  occur  in  adulthood.  Cases  in  adults  can  be  classified  into  those 
resulting  in  fasting  hypoglycemia,  postprandial  hypoglycemia,  and 
exercise-induced hypoglycemia.

Fasting Hypoglycemia  Although rare, disorders of glycogenolysis 
can result in fasting hypoglycemia. These disorders include glycogen 
storage  disease  (GSD)  of  types  0,  I,  III,  and  IV  and  Fanconi-Bickel 
syndrome (Chap. 419). Patients with GSD types I and III characteristi-
cally have high blood lactate levels before and after meals, respectively. 
Both groups have hypertriglyceridemia, but ketones are high in GSD 
type III. Defects in fatty acid oxidation also result in fasting hypogly-
cemia. These defects can include (1) defects in the carnitine cycle; (2) 
fatty-acid  β-oxidation  disorders;  (3)  electron  transfer  disturbances; 
and  (4)  ketogenesis  disorders.  Finally,  defects  in  gluconeogenesis 
(fructose-1,6-biphosphatase) have been reported to result in recurrent 
hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis.

Postprandial Hypoglycemia 
Inborn errors of metabolism result-
ing in postprandial hypoglycemia are also rare. These errors include (1) 
glucokinase, SUR1, and Kir6.2 potassium channel mutations; (2) con-
genital disorders of glycosylation; and (3) inherited fructose intolerance.

Exercise-Induced  Hypoglycemia  Exercise-induced  hypoglyce-
mia,  by  definition,  follows  exercise.  It  results  in  hyperinsulinemia 
caused by increased activity of monocarboxylate transporter 1 in β cells.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Hypoglycemia

In addition to the recognition and documentation of hypoglycemia 
as well as its treatment (often on an urgent basis), diagnosis of the 
hypoglycemic mechanism is critical for the selection of therapy that 
prevents, or at least minimizes, recurrent hypoglycemia. 

RECOGNITION AND DOCUMENTATION
Hypoglycemia  is  suspected  in  patients  with  typical  symptoms;  in 
the  presence  of  confusion,  an  altered  level  of  consciousness,  or  a 
seizure;  or  in  a  clinical  setting  in  which  hypoglycemia  is  known 
to  occur.  Blood  should  be  drawn,  whenever  possible,  before  the 
administration of glucose to allow documentation of a low plasma 
glucose  concentration.  Convincing  documentation  of  hypoglyce-
mia  requires  the  fulfillment  of  Whipple’s  triad.  Thus,  the  ideal 
time to measure the plasma glucose level is during a symptomatic 
episode. A normal glucose level excludes hypoglycemia as the cause 
of the symptoms. A low glucose level confirms that hypoglycemia 
is  the  cause  of  the  symptoms,  provided  the  latter  resolve  after 
the  glucose  level  is  raised.  When  the  cause  of  the  hypoglycemic 
episode  is  obscure,  additional  measurements—made  while  the 
glucose level is low and before treatment—should include plasma 
insulin,  C-peptide,  proinsulin,  and  β-hydroxybutyrate  levels;  also 
critical are screening for circulating oral hypoglycemic agents and 
assessment of symptoms before and after the plasma glucose con-
centration is raised.

When  the  history  suggests  prior  hypoglycemia  and  no  poten-
tial  mechanism  is  apparent,  the  diagnostic  strategy  is  to  evaluate 
the patient as just described and assess for Whipple’s triad during 
and after an episode of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, while it 
cannot  be  ignored,  a  distinctly  low  plasma  glucose  concentration 
measured in a patient without corresponding symptoms raises the 
possibility of an artifact (pseudohypoglycemia). 

DIAGNOSIS OF THE HYPOGLYCEMIC MECHANISM
In a patient with documented hypoglycemia, a plausible hypogly-
cemic mechanism can often be deduced from the history, physical 
examination,  and  available  laboratory  data  (Table  406-1).  Drugs, 
particularly alcohol or agents used to treat diabetes, should be the 
first consideration—even in the absence of known use of a relevant 
drug—given the possibility of surreptitious, accidental, or malicious 
drug  administration.  Other  considerations  include  evidence  of  a 
relevant  critical  illness,  hormone  deficiencies  (less  commonly), 
and a non-β-cell tumor that can be pursued diagnostically (rarely). 
Absent  one  of  these  mechanisms  in  an  otherwise  seemingly  well 
individual,  the  care  provider  should  consider  endogenous  hyper-
insulinism  and  proceed  with  measurements  and  assessment  of 
symptoms during spontaneous hypoglycemia or under conditions 
that might elicit hypoglycemia. 

URGENT TREATMENT
If the patient is able and willing, oral treatment with glucose tab-
lets or glucose-containing fluids, candy, or food is appropriate. A 
reasonable initial dose is 15–20 g of glucose. If the patient is unable 
or  unwilling  (because  of  neuroglycopenia)  to  take  carbohydrates 
orally,  parenteral  therapy  is  necessary.  IV  administration  of  glu-
cose  (25  g)  should  be  followed  by  a  glucose  infusion  guided  by 
serial plasma glucose measurements. If IV therapy is not practical, 
SC or IM glucagon (1.0 mg in adults) can be used, particularly in 
patients  with  T1DM.  Because  it  acts  by  stimulating  glycogenoly-
sis,  glucagon  is  ineffective  in  glycogen-depleted  individuals  (e.g., 
those  with  alcohol-induced  hypoglycemia).  Glucagon  also  stim-
ulates insulin secretion and is therefore less useful in T2DM. The

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismsomatostatin analogue octreotide can be used to suppress insulin 
secretion in sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. These treatments 
raise plasma glucose concentrations only transiently, and patients 
should  therefore  be  urged  to  eat  as  soon  as  is  practical  to  replete 
glycogen stores. 
PREVENTION OF RECURRENT HYPOGLYCEMIA
Prevention of recurrent hypoglycemia requires an understanding of 
the hypoglycemic mechanism. Offending drugs can be discontin-
ued or their doses reduced. Hypoglycemia caused by a sulfonylurea 
can persist for hours or even days. Underlying critical illnesses can 
often be treated. Cortisol and growth hormone can be replaced if 
levels are deficient. Surgical, radiotherapeutic, or chemotherapeutic 
reduction of a non–islet cell tumor can alleviate hypoglycemia even 
if  the  tumor  cannot  be  cured;  glucocorticoid  or  growth  hormone 
administration  also  may  reduce  hypoglycemic  episodes  in  such 
patients.  Surgical  resection  of  an  insulinoma  is  curative;  medical 
therapy  with  diazoxide  or  octreotide  can  be  used  if  resection  is 
not possible and in patients with a nontumor β-cell disorder. Par-
tial  pancreatectomy  may  be  necessary  in  the  latter  patients.  The 
treatment of autoimmune hypoglycemia (e.g., with glucocorticoid 
or  immunosuppressive  drugs)  is  problematic,  but  these  disorders 
are sometimes self-limited. Failing these treatments, frequent feed-
ings and avoidance of fasting may be required. Administration of 
uncooked cornstarch at bedtime or even an overnight intragastric 
infusion of glucose may be necessary for some patients.

Lipoproteins are complexes of lipids and proteins that are essential for 
transport  of  cholesterol,  triglycerides  (TGs),  and  fat-soluble  vitamins 
in  the  blood.  Lipoproteins  play  essential  roles  in  the  absorption  of 
dietary cholesterol, long-chain fatty acids, and fat-soluble vitamins; the 
transport of TGs, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the liver 
to peripheral tissues; and the transport of cholesterol from peripheral 
tissues back to the liver and intestine for excretion. Disorders of lipo-
protein  metabolism  can  be  primary  (caused  by  genetic  conditions) 
or  secondary  (to  other  medical  conditions  or  environmental  expo-
sures) and involve either a substantial increase or decrease in specific 
circulating  lipids  or  lipoproteins.  Lipoprotein  disorders  can  have  a 
number of clinical consequences, most notably premature atheroscle-
rotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and are therefore important to 
appropriately diagnose and treat. This chapter reviews the etiology and 

pathophysiology  of  disorders  of  lipoprotein  metabolism  and  clinical 
approaches to their diagnosis and management.

LIPOPROTEIN STRUCTURE  
AND METABOLISM
Lipoproteins contain an “oil droplet” core of hydrophobic lipids (TGs 
and  cholesteryl  esters)  surrounded  by  a  shell  of  hydrophilic  lipids 
(phospholipids,  unesterified  cholesterol)  and  proteins  (called  apoli-
poproteins)  that  interact  with  body  fluids  (Fig.  407-1).  The  plasma 
lipoproteins are divided into major classes based on their relative den-
sity: chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), intermedi-
ate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), and 
high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Each lipoprotein class comprises a 
family of particles that vary in density, size, and protein composition. 
Because lipid is less dense than water, the density of a lipoprotein par-
ticle is primarily determined by the amount of lipid per particle. Chy-
lomicrons are the most lipid-rich and therefore least dense lipoprotein 
particles, whereas HDLs have the least lipid and are therefore the most 
dense. Lipoprotein particles vary widely in size, with the largest parti-
cles being the most lipid-rich (chylomicrons) and the smallest particles 
being the most dense (HDL).

The  proteins  associated  with  lipoproteins,  called  apolipoproteins 
(Table 407-1), are required for the assembly, structure, function, and 
metabolism of lipoproteins. Apolipoproteins provide a structural basis 
for  lipoproteins,  activate  enzymes  important  in  lipoprotein  metabo-
lism,  and  act  as  ligands  for  cell  surface  receptors.  ApoB  is  the  major 
structural  protein  of  chylomicrons,  VLDLs,  IDLs,  and  LDLs  (collec-
tively known as apoB-containing lipoproteins). One molecule of apoB, 
either apoB-48 (chylomicrons) or apoB-100 (VLDL, IDL, or LDL), is 
present on each lipoprotein particle. The human liver synthesizes the 
full-length apoB-100 (one of the largest proteins in humans), whereas 
the intestine makes the shorter apoB-48, which is derived from tran-
scription  of  the  same  APOB  gene  after  posttranscriptional  mRNA 
editing. HDLs lack apoB and have different apolipoproteins that define 
this lipoprotein class, most importantly apoA-I, which is synthesized in 
both the liver and intestine and is found on virtually all HDL particles. 
ApoA-II is the second most abundant HDL apolipoprotein and is on 
approximately two-thirds of the HDL particles. ApoC-II, apoC-III, and 
apoA-V regulate the metabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins. ApoE plays a 
critical role in the metabolism and clearance of TG-rich particles. Most 
apolipoproteins,  other  than  apoB,  exchange  actively  among  lipopro-
tein particles in the blood. Apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] is a distinctive 
apolipoprotein that results in the formation of a lipoprotein known as 
lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and is discussed more below.

 ■ TRANSPORT OF INTESTINALLY DERIVED 
DIETARY LIPIDS BY CHYLOMICRONS
The critical role of chylomicrons is the efficient transport of absorbed 
dietary  lipids  from  the  intestine  to  tissues  that  require  fatty  acids 
for  energy  or  storage  and  then  return  of  cholesterol  to  the  liver 
(Fig.  407-2).  Dietary  lipids  are  hydrolyzed  by  lipases  within  the 
intestinal  lumen  and  emulsified  with  bile  acids  to  form  micelles. 
Dietary cholesterol, fatty acids, and fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed 
in the proximal small intestine. Cholesterol and retinol are esterified 
(by the addition of a fatty acid) in the enterocyte to form cholesteryl 
esters  and  retinyl  esters,  respectively.  Longer-chain  fatty  acids  (>12 
carbons)  are  incorporated  into  TGs  and  packaged  with  apoB-48, 
phospholipids,  cholesteryl  esters,  retinyl  esters,  and  α-tocopherol 
(vitamin E) in a process that requires the action of the microsomal TG 
transfer protein (MTP) to form chylomicrons. Nascent chylomicrons 
are  secreted  into  the  intestinal  lymph  and  delivered  via  the  thoracic 
duct  directly  to  the  systemic  circulation,  where  they  are  extensively 
processed by peripheral tissues before reaching the liver. The particles 
encounter  lipoprotein  lipase  (LPL),  which  is  anchored  to  the  endo-
thelial  surfaces  of  capillaries  in  adipose  tissue  and  heart  and  skeletal 
muscle (Fig. 407-2). ApoC-II and apoA-V are apolipoproteins that are 
transferred  to  circulating  chylomicrons  from  HDL  in  the  postpran-
dial state; apoC-II acts as a required cofactor for LPL activation, and 
apoA-V serves as a facilitator of LPL activity. The TGs in chylomicrons

are hydrolyzed by LPL, and free fatty acids are released and taken up 
by adjacent myocytes or adipocytes and are either oxidized to generate 
energy or reesterified and stored as TG. Some of the released free fatty 
acids bind albumin before entering cells and are transported to other 
tissues,  especially  the  liver.  The  chylomicron  particle  progressively 
shrinks in size as the hydrophobic TG core is hydrolyzed and the excess 
hydrophilic lipids (cholesterol and phospholipids) and apolipoproteins 
on  the  particle  surface  are  transferred  to  HDL,  ultimately  creating 
chylomicron remnants.

Chylomicron  remnants  contain  apoB-48,  which  lacks  the  region 
in  apoB-100  that  binds  to  the  LDL  receptor.  Nevertheless,  they  are 
rapidly  removed  from  the  circulation  by  the  liver  through  a  process 
that critically requires apoE as a ligand for receptors in the liver. Few, 
if any, chylomicrons or chylomicron remnants are generally present in 
the blood after a 12-h fast, except in patients with certain disorders of 
lipoprotein metabolism.
 ■ TRANSPORT OF HEPATICALLY DERIVED  
LIPIDS BY VLDL AND LDL
Another key role of lipoproteins is the transport of hepatic lipids from 
the  liver  to  the  periphery  (Fig.  407-2)  to  provide  an  energy  source 
during fasting. During the fasting state, lipolysis of adipose TGs gen-
erates fatty acids that are transported to the liver, and the liver is also 
capable of synthesizing fatty acids through de novo lipogenesis. These 
fatty acids are esterified by the liver into TGs, which are packaged into 
VLDL particles along with apoB-100, phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, 
and vitamin E in a process that also requires MTP. VLDL thus resemble 
chylomicrons in that they are “triglyceride-rich lipoproteins,” but they 
contain apoB-100 rather than apoB-48, are smaller and less buoyant,

and have a higher ratio of cholesterol to TG (~1 mg of cholesterol for 
every 5 mg of TG, whereas in chylomicrons, this ratio is closer to ~1:8). 
After  secretion  by  the  liver  into  the  plasma,  the  circulating  TGs  in 
VLDL are hydrolyzed by LPL. After the relatively TG-depleted VLDL 
remnants dissociate from LPL, they are referred to as IDLs, which con-
tain roughly similar amounts of cholesterol and TG by mass. The liver 
removes ~40–60% of IDL by receptor-mediated endocytosis via bind-
ing  to  apoE,  which  is  acquired  through  transfer  of  this  protein  from 
HDL.  The  remainder  of  IDL  is  further  remodeled  by  hepatic  lipase 
(HL) to form LDL. During this process, phospholipids and TGs in the 
particle  are  hydrolyzed,  and  most  of  the  remaining  apolipoproteins 
except apoB-100 are transferred to other lipoproteins. LDL is primarily 
a  by-product  of  fatty  acid  energy  transport  by  VLDL  with  little  true 
physiologic role; one exception is that LDL may be partially responsi-
ble for delivery of vitamin E to the retina and brain. LDL is ultimately 
removed from the circulation by receptor-mediated endocytosis (pri-
marily  via  the  LDL  receptor)  in  the  liver,  with  a  region  of  apoB-100 
serving as the specific ligand for binding to the LDL receptor. It should 
be  noted  that  apoB-48  does  not  contain  the  LDL  receptor-binding 
ligand  region,  and  therefore,  clearance  of  apoB-48-containing  chylo-
micron remnants is dependent on apoE-mediated clearance as noted 
above.  Some  LDL  particles  are  lipolytically  processed  to  small  dense 
LDL particles that are believed to be especially atherogenic.

Lp(a)  is  a  lipoprotein  similar  to  LDL  in  lipid  and  protein  compo-
sition,  but  it  contains  an  additional  distinctive  protein  called  apo(a). 
Apo(a) is synthesized in the liver and attached to apoB-100 by a disul-
fide linkage. The major site of clearance of Lp(a) is the liver, but the 
uptake pathway is not known. Lp(a) is now established as causal factor 
for  ASCVD,  and  an  elevated  level  of  Lp(a)  serves  as  an  independent 
risk factor and merits more aggressive therapy to reduce LDL choles-
terol levels (see below).
 ■ HDL METABOLISM AND REVERSE CHOLESTEROL 
TRANSPORT
All  nucleated  cells  synthesize  cholesterol,  but  only  hepatocytes  and 
enterocytes  can  effectively  excrete  cholesterol  from  the  body,  into 
either the bile or the gut lumen, respectively. In the liver, cholesterol is 
secreted into the bile, either directly or after conversion to bile acids. 
Cholesterol  in  peripheral  cells  is  transported  from  the  plasma  mem-
branes of peripheral cells to the liver and intestine by a process termed 
reverse cholesterol transport that is facilitated by HDL (Fig. 407-3).

Nascent HDL particles are synthesized by the intestine and the liver. 
Newly secreted apoA-I rapidly acquires phospholipids and unesterified 
cholesterol  from  its  site  of  synthesis  (intestine  or  liver)  via  cellular 
efflux promoted by the membrane protein ATP-binding cassette pro-
tein  A1  (ABCA1).  This  process  results  in  the  formation  of  discoidal 
HDL  particles,  which  then  recruit  additional  unesterified  cholesterol 
from  cells  or  circulating  lipoproteins.  Within  the  HDL  particle,  the 
cholesterol is esterified to cholesteryl ester (CE) through the addition 
of a fatty acid by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a plasma 
enzyme  associated  with  HDL;  the  hydrophobic  CE  forms  the  core

of  the  mature  HDL  particle.  As  HDL  acquires  more  CE,  it  becomes 
spherical,  and  additional  apolipoproteins  and  lipids  are  transferred 
to the particles from the surfaces of chylomicrons and VLDLs during 
lipolysis.

HDL cholesterol in the blood is transported to hepatocytes by two 
major pathways. HDL CE can be “selectively” taken up by hepatocytes 

via the scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a cell surface 
HDL receptor that mediates the selective transfer of CE 
from HDL with subsequent dissociation and “recycling” 
of the HDL particle. In addition, HDL CE can be trans-
ferred  to  apoB-containing  lipoproteins  in  exchange  for 
TG  by  the  cholesteryl  ester  transfer  protein  (CETP). 
The  CE  esters  are  then  removed  from  the  circulation 
by  LDL  receptor–mediated  endocytosis.  HDL-derived 
CE taken up by the hepatocyte through these pathways 
is hydrolyzed, and much of the cholesterol is ultimately 
excreted directly into the bile or converted to bile acids 
with  excretion  to  bile,  providing  a  biliary  route  into 
the intestinal lumen. There is also evidence that, under 
certain conditions, HDL cholesterol can be transported 
directly  into  the  intestinal  lumen  without  requiring  a 
transhepatobiliary route, a process known as transinten-
stinal cholesterol excretion.

HDL  particles  undergo  extensive  remodeling  within 
the  plasma  compartment  by  a  variety  of  lipid  transfer 
proteins  and  lipases.  The  phospholipid  transfer  protein 
(PLTP)  transfers  phospholipids  from  other  lipoproteins 
to  HDL  or  among  different  classes  of  HDL  particles 
and is a regulator of HDL metabolism. After CETP- and 
PLTP-mediated  lipid  exchange,  the  TG-enriched  HDL 
becomes a much better substrate for HL, which hydro-
lyzes  the  TGs  and  phospholipids  to  generate  smaller 
HDL particles. A related enzyme called endothelial lipase 
(EL) hydrolyzes HDL phospholipids, generating smaller 
HDL particles that are catabolized faster. Remodeling of 
HDL  influences  the  metabolism,  function,  and  plasma 
concentrations of HDL.

SCREENING
Dyslipidemia  is  an  important  causal  factor  in  ASCVD, 
and treatment has  been  proven  to  substantially  reduce 
cardiovascular  risk.  Therefore,  all  adults  (and  many 
children) should be actively screened for plasma lipids. A lipid panel 
should  be  measured,  preferably  after  an  overnight  fast.  In  most 
clinical laboratories, the total cholesterol and TGs in the plasma are 
measured  enzymatically,  and  then  after  precipitation  of  apoB-con-
taining lipoproteins, the cholesterol in the supernatant is measured to 
determine the HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). The LDL cholesterol (LDL-
C) is then estimated using the following equation (the 
Friedewald formula):

pathway transports excess cholesterol from the periphery back to the liver for excretion in the bile. 
The liver and the intestine produce nascent HDLs. Free cholesterol is acquired from macrophages and 
other peripheral cells and esterified by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), forming mature 
HDLs. HDL cholesterol can be selectively taken up by the liver via SR-BI (scavenger receptor class BI). 
Alternatively, HDL cholesteryl ester can be transferred by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) 
from HDLs to very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and chylomicrons, which can then be taken up 
by  the  liver.  IDL,  intermediate-density  lipoprotein;  LDL,  low-density  lipoprotein;  LDLR,  low-density

LDL-C = total cholesterol – (TG/5) – HDL-C

(The  VLDL  cholesterol  content  is  estimated  by 
dividing the plasma TG by 5, reflecting the ratio of TG 
to cholesterol in VLDL particles.) This formula is rea-
sonably  accurate  if  test  results  are  obtained  on  fasting 
plasma and if the TG level does not exceed ~200 mg/
dL;  by  convention,  it  cannot  be  used  if  the  TG  level 
is  >400  mg/dL.  LDL-C  can  be  directly  measured  by  a 
number  of  methods.  The  non-HDL-C  can  be  easily 
calculated  by  subtracting  the  HDL-C  from  the  total 
cholesterol.  It  has  the  advantage  of  incorporating  the 
cholesterol  contained  within  VLDL  and  IDL,  which 
in most cases is also atherogenic and associated with 
increased  ASCVD  risk.  There  is  increasing  evidence 
that measurement of plasma apoB levels may provide 
a  better  assessment  of  cardiovascular  risk  than  the 
LDL-C  level,  and  even  the  non-HDL-C  level,  and  is 
recommended  by  some  experts.  While  this  has  not 
yet  become  standard  clinical  practice,  the  data  sup-
porting the use of apoB as a risk marker and guide to 
therapeutic intervention are quite strong. There is also 
increasing  interest  in  Lp(a),  an  independent  ASCVD 
risk factor that is highly heritable and may be helpful

3138 in risk stratification. In patients with evidence of dyslipidemia, fur-
ther  evaluation  and  treatment  are  based  on  evidence  of  preexisting 
ASCVD  and  clinical  assessment  of  cardiovascular  risk  using  risk 
calculators such as the American Heart Association (AHA)/American 
College of Cardiology (ACC) risk calculator as well as, in some cases, 
based on additional approaches to risk assessment such as apoB and 
Lp(a) (see “Approach to the Patient” for more detailed discussion).

DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED 
APOB-CONTAINING LIPOPROTEINS
Disorders  of  lipoprotein  metabolism  that  cause  elevated  levels  of 
apoB-containing  lipoproteins  are  among  the  most  common  and 
clinically  important  of  the  dyslipoproteinemias.  They  are  generally 
characterized by increased plasma levels of total cholesterol, accom-
panied by increased TGs, LDL-C, or both. Many patients with hyper-
lipidemia  have  some  combination  of  genetic  predisposition  (often 
polygenic)  and  medical  or  environmental  contribution  (medical 
condition,  diet,  lifestyle,  or  drug).  Many,  but  not  all,  patients  with 
hyperlipidemia are at increased risk for ASCVD, which is the primary 
reason  for  making  the  diagnosis,  as  intervention  can  substantially 
reduce  this  risk.  In  addition,  patients  with  severe  hypertriglyceri-
demia may be at risk for acute pancreatitis and require intervention 
to reduce this risk.

Although  hundreds  of  proteins  influence  lipoprotein  metabolism, 
and  genetic  variants  in  most  of  the  genes  that  encode  them  interact 
with each other and the environment to produce dyslipidemia, there 
are a limited number of discrete “nodes” or pathways that regulate lipo-
protein  metabolism  and  are  dysfunctional  in  specific  dyslipidemias. 
These include (1) lipolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins by LPL; (2) receptor- 
mediated  uptake  of  apoB-containing  lipoproteins  by  the  liver;  (3) 
cellular cholesterol metabolism in the hepatocyte and the enterocyte; 
(4) assembly and secretion of VLDLs by the liver; and (5) neutral lipid 
transfer  and  phospholipid  hydrolysis  in  the  plasma.  Primary  genetic 
disorders of lipoprotein metabolism caused by single-gene mutations 
(Table 407-2) have taught us a great deal about the physiologic roles of 
specific proteins in these pathways in humans and are clinically impor-
tant to diagnose and treat.
 ■ SEVERE HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA
Severe  hypertriglyceridemia  (HTG)  is  defined  by  fasting  TG  levels 
>500 mg/dL and is usually accompanied by moderately elevated total 
cholesterol levels and reduced levels of HDL-C, usually without impor-
tant  elevation  in  LDL-C  or  apoB.  It  is  medically  important  because 
it  is  associated  with  risk  of  acute  pancreatitis  and,  in  some  cases,  is 
also associated with increased risk of ASCVD. Severe HTG is usually 
caused  by  impaired  lipolysis  of  TGs  in  TG-rich  lipoproteins  (TRLs) 
by  the  enzyme  LPL.  LPL  is  synthesized  by  adipocytes,  skeletal  myo-
cytes,  and  cardiomyocytes,  and  its  posttranslational  maturation  and 
folding require the action of lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1). After 
secretion,  it  is  transported  from  the  subendothelial  to  the  vascular 
endothelial  surfaces  by  GPIHPB1,  which  docks  it  to  the  endothelial 
surface. ApoC-II is a required cofactor for LPL, and apoA-V promotes 
LPL activity, and both are transported to the bound LPL on the TRLs. 
Single-gene  Mendelian  disorders  that  reduce  LPL  activity  have  been 
described  (Table  407-3)  as  reviewed  below;  the  majority  of  patients 
with severe HTG have a polygenic predisposition to secondary factors 
like obesity or insulin resistance.

Primary  (Genetic)  Causes  of  Severe  Hypertriglyceridemia  •  
FAMILIAL  CHYLOMICRONEMIA  SYNDROME  (FCS)  LPL  is  required 
for the hydrolysis of TGs in chylomicrons and VLDLs. Genetic defi-
ciency or inactivity of LPL results in impaired lipolysis and profound 
elevations  in  plasma  TGs,  mostly  in  chylomicrons.  While  chylomi-
cronemia  predominates,  in  fact,  these  patients  often  have  elevated 
plasma  levels  of  VLDL  as  well.  The  fasting  plasma  is  turbid,  and  if 
left  undisturbed  for  several  hours,  the  chylomicrons  float  to  the  top 
and form a creamy supernatant layer. Fasting TG levels are >500 mg/
dL  and  usually  >1000  mg/dL.  Because  chylomicrons  contain  choles-
terol,  fasting  total  cholesterol  levels  are  also  elevated.  There  are  five 

genes  in  which  mutations  can  result  in  FCS  (Table  407-2).  FCS  has 
an  estimated  frequency  of  ~1  in  200,000–300,000,  although  its  true 
prevalence  is  unknown.  The  most  common  molecular  cause  of  FCS 
involves  mutations  in  the  LPL  gene.  LPL  deficiency  has  autosomal 
recessive  inheritance  (loss-of-function  mutations  in  both  alleles). 
Heterozygotes with LPL mutations often have moderate elevations in 
plasma TG levels and increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). 
FCS can also be caused by mutations in genes that affect LPL process-
ing  or  activity.  For  example,  apoC-II  is  a  required  cofactor  for  LPL. 
APOC2 deficiency due to loss-of-function mutations in both APOC2 
alleles results in functional lack of LPL activity and severe hyperchy-
lomicronemia that is indistinguishable from LPL deficiency. It is also 
recessive in inheritance pattern and much rarer than LPL deficiency. 
Another  apolipoprotein,  apoA-V,  facilitates  the  association  of  TRLs 
with LPL and promotes hydrolysis of the TGs. Individuals harboring 
loss-of-function  mutations  in  both  APOA5  alleles  causing  APOA5 
deficiency develop a form of FCS. GPIHBP1 is required for transport 
and tethering of LPL to the endothelial luminal surface. Homozygosity 
for mutations in GPIHBP1 that interfere with its synthesis or folding 
cause  FCS.  Autoantibodies  to  GPIHBP1  have  also  been  reported  to 
cause  severe  hyperchylomicronemia.  Finally,  LMF1  is  required  for 
appropriate processing and folding of LPL, and bialleleic loss-of-function 
mutations can cause FCS.

FCS can present in childhood or adulthood with severe abdominal 
pain due to acute pancreatitis. In this setting, the diagnosis should be 
suspected  if  a  fasting  TG  level  is  >500  mg/dL.  Eruptive  xanthomas, 
which  are  small,  yellowish-white  papules,  may  appear  in  clusters  on 
the  back,  buttocks,  and  extensor  surfaces  of  the  arms  and  legs.  On 
funduscopic examination, the retinal blood vessels may be opalescent 
(lipemia retinalis). Hepatosplenomegaly is sometimes noted as a result 
of uptake of circulating chylomicrons by reticuloendothelial cells in the 
liver and spleen. Premature ASCVD is not generally a feature of FCS.

The  diagnosis  of  FCS  is  a  clinical  diagnosis  based  on  persistence 
and severity of HTG, with a history of acute pancreatitis or eruptive 
xanthomas increasing the suspicion. While LPL activity can be mea-
sured in “postheparin plasma” obtained after an IV heparin injection 
to release the endothelial-bound LPL, this assay is not widely available. 
Genetic testing of a panel of candidate FCS genes can be used to con-
firm the diagnosis but is not required for making the clinical diagnosis.
Because  of  the  risk  of  pancreatitis,  it  is  important  to  consider  the 
diagnosis  and  institute  therapeutic  interventions  in  FCS.  The  goal  is 
to prevent pancreatitis by reducing fasting TG levels to <500 mg/dL. 
Consultation  with  a  registered  dietician  familiar  with  this  disorder 
is  essential.  Dietary  fat  intake  should  be  markedly  restricted  (to  as 
little as 15 g/d), often with fat-soluble vitamin supplementation. Strict 
adherence to dietary fat restriction can be successful at controlling the 
chylomicronemia; fish oils or fibrates (such as fenofibrate) may be tried 
but are unlikely to be effective. A new therapeutic approach involving 
the silencing of APOC3 with an antisense oligonucleotide is approved 
in Europe for patients with FCS. In patients with APOC2 deficiency, 
apoC-II can be provided exogenously by infusing fresh-frozen plasma 
to resolve the chylomicronemia in the setting of severe acute pancreati-
tis. Management of patients with FCS is particularly challenging during 
pregnancy when VLDL production is increased.

FAMILIAL  PARTIAL  LIPODYSTROPHY  (FPLD)  FPLD  is  a  genetic  con-
dition in which the generation of adipose tissue in certain fat depots 
is  impaired  and  in  others  is  excessive.  FPLD  is  an  underrecognized 
monogenic cause of severe HTG, which is likely due to both increased 
lipid synthesis and VLDL production, as well as reduced LPL-mediated 
clearance of TRLs. FPLD is typically a dominantly inherited disorder 
caused  by  mutations  in  several  different  genes,  including  lamin  A/C 
(LMNA),  PPARγ  (PPARG),  perilipin  (PLIN1),  AKT2,  and  ADRA2A 
(Table  407-2).  FPLD  is  characterized  by  loss  of  subcutaneous  fat  in 
the extremities and buttocks, often accompanied by increased visceral 
fat. Because of the reduced or absent subcutaneous fat in the arms and 
legs, patients are often described as having a “muscular” appearance. In 
addition to severe HTG, FPLD patients usually have insulin resistance, 
often quite severe, accompanied by type 2 diabetes and hepatosteatosis.

Pancreatitis  secondary  to  HTG  can  be  a  complication;  in  addition, 
ASCVD risk is increased in FPLD patients. The diagnosis of FPLD is 
a  clinical  diagnosis  based  on  the  constellation  of  metabolic  findings 
accompanied by the distinctive distribution of adipose tissue. Genetic 
testing of a panel of candidate FPLD genes can be used to confirm the 
diagnosis but is not required for making the clinical diagnosis. Because 
FPLD is a dominant disorder, the finding of a causal mutation should 
lead to family-based screening.

The  dyslipidemia  of  FPLD  can  be  difficult  to  manage  clinically. 
Patients should be treated aggressively not only to reduce TG levels but 
also with statins and, if necessary, additional LDL-lowering therapies 
to reduce atherogenic lipoproteins. The insulin-resistant diabetes often 
requires aggressive management as well. Some patients have progres-
sion of fatty liver disease to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis. 
A  different  group  of  very  rare  patients  have  congenital  generalized 
lipodystrophy, a recessive disorder caused by mutations in the AGPAT2

and  BSCL2  genes.  These  patients  have  nearly  complete  absence  of 
subcutaneous fat, accompanied by profound leptin deficiency, insulin 
resistance, severe HTG, and accumulation of TGs in multiple tissues 
including  the  liver.  Patients  with  generalized  lipodystrophy  can  be 
effectively treated with recombinant leptin administration, which often 
manages the multiple metabolic issues in these patients.

Multifactorial Severe Hypertriglyceridemia  Most patients with 
severe  HTG  do  not  have  a  single-gene  mutation  but  instead  have  a 
multifactorial  etiology  that  includes  genetics  and  environment.  The 
prevalence of this phenotype is ~1 in 1000. HTG often runs in families, 
and the term familial HTG has been employed; however, except for the 
genes in which mutations cause FCS or FPLD, reviewed above, no other 
classic Mendelian causes of HTG have been identified to date. Instead, 
extensive  human  genetic  studies  have  clearly  established  a  polygenic 
basis to this phenotype that consists of two categories: (1) rare heterozy-
gous variants in the five genes discussed earlier that cause FCS in the 
homozygous state, and (2) a high burden of common variants that have 
small individual effects at raising TGs. Patients who inherit some combi-
nation of rare and common TG-raising alleles often have environmental 
factors that exacerbate their HTG. These “secondary” factors are reviewed 
in detail below, but the quantitatively most important factors promoting 
HTG  include  obesity,  type  2  diabetes,  insulin  resistance,  and  alcohol 
use.  Multifactorial  HTG  is  characterized  by  elevated  fasting  TGs  but 
average to below average LDL-C levels and low HDL-C levels; apoB lev-
els are not generally elevated. This condition is not generally associated 
with a significantly increased risk of ASCVD. However, if the HTG is 
exacerbated by environmental factors, medical conditions, or drugs, the 
TGs can rise to a level at which acute pancreatitis is a risk. Indeed, man-
agement of patients with this condition is mostly focused on reduction 
of TGs to prevent pancreatitis. It is important to consider and rule out 
secondary causes of the HTG. Patients who are at high risk for ASCVD 
due to other risk factors should be treated with statin therapy. In patients 
who  are  otherwise  not  at  high  risk  for  ASCVD,  lipid-lowering  drug 
therapy can frequently be avoided with appropriate dietary and lifestyle 
changes. Patients with plasma TG levels >500 mg/dL after a trial of diet 
and exercise should be considered for drug therapy with a fibrate or fish 
oil to reduce TGs in order to prevent pancreatitis. These patients should 
also be carefully evaluated for ASCVD risk and may be candidates for 
statin therapy to further reduce cholesterol and cardiovascular risk.

 ■ HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (ELEVATED LDL-C)
Elevated LDL-C is common and is medically important because it is 
associated  with  risk  of  premature  ASCVD.  Elevated  LDL-C  is  often 

caused  by  impaired  uptake  of  LDL  by  the  liver.  As  discussed  above, 
the LDL receptor is the major receptor responsible for uptake of LDL, 
and  most  causes  of  elevated  LDL-C  converge  on  reduced  expression 
or activity of the LDL receptor in the liver. One major environmental 
factor that reduces LDL receptor activity is a diet high in saturated and 
trans fats. Other medical conditions that reduce LDL receptor activity 
include hypothyroidism and estrogen deficiency. Single-gene Mende-
lian  disorders  involving  several  genes  that  influence  LDL  clearance 
should be considered in patients with LDL-C levels >190 mg/dL (Table 
407-2). However, the majority of patients with elevated LDL-C have a 
polygenic predisposition exacerbated by secondary factors like a diet 
high in saturated and trans fats.

Primary  (Genetic)  Causes  of  Elevated  LDL-C  •  FAMILIAL 
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (FH)  FH is an autosomal dominant dis-
order  characterized  by  elevated  plasma  levels  of  LDL-C  usually  with 
relatively  normal  TG  levels.  FH  is  caused  by  mutations  that  lead  to 
reduced function of the LDL receptor, with the most common being 
mutations  in  the  LDLR  gene  itself.  The  reduction  in  LDL  receptor 
activity in the liver results in a reduced rate of clearance of LDL from 
the circulation. The plasma level of LDL increases to a level such that 
the rate of LDL production equals the rate of LDL clearance by residual 
LDL  receptor  as  well  as  non-LDL  receptor  mechanisms.  Individuals 
with two mutated LDLR alleles (homozygotes or compound heterozy-
gotes)  have  much  higher  LDL-C  levels  than  those  with  one  mutant 
allele, causing a condition known as homozygous FH.

Although  mutations  in  LDLR  are  the  most  common  cause  of  FH 
(and  originally  the  term  FH  was  used  specifically  for  patients  with 
LDLR  mutations),  mutations  in  at  least  two  other  genes,  APOB  and 
PCSK9, can also cause FH. ApoB-100 is the critical structural protein 
in LDL and contains a domain that serves as the ligand for binding to 
the LDL receptor. Mutations in the LDL receptor–binding domain of 
apoB-100 reduce the affinity of apoB/LDL binding to the LDL receptor, 
such that LDL is removed from the circulation at a reduced rate. This 
condition has also been termed familial defective apoB (FDB). Of note, 
truncating  mutations  in  APOB  cause  low  LDL-C  levels  (see  below). 
The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a secreted 
protein  that  binds  to  the  LDL  receptor  and  targets  it  for  lysosomal 
degradation. Normally, after LDL binds to the LDL receptor, it is inter-
nalized along with the receptor, and in the low pH of the endosome, the 
LDL receptor dissociates from the LDL and recycles to the cell surface. 
When circulating PCSK9 binds the receptor, the complex is internal-
ized and the receptor is directed to the lysosome, rather than to the cell 
surface, reducing the number of active LDL receptors. Gain-of-function

mutations in PCSK9 that enhance the activity of PCSK9 cause a form 
of FH, also known as ADH type 3. Of note, loss-of-function mutations 
in PCSK9 reduce LDL-C levels (see below).

The population frequency of heterozygous FH was originally esti-
mated to be 1 in 500 individuals, but recent data suggest it may be as 
high as ~1 in 250 individuals, making it one of the most common single- 
gene disorders in humans. FH has a much higher prevalence in certain 
founder  populations,  such  as  South  African  Afrikaners,  Christian 
Lebanese, French Canadians, and Lancaster County Amish. Heterozy-
gous FH is characterized by elevated plasma levels of LDL-C (usually 
>190  mg/dL)  and  relatively  normal  levels  of  TGs.  Patients  with  FH 
have hypercholesterolemia from birth, and FH diagnosis is often based 
on detection of hypercholesterolemia on routine lipid screening; this 
serves as the basis for the recommendation to screen children between 
the ages of 9 and 11. A family history of hypercholesterolemia or pre-
mature ASCVD should prompt targeted screening. Inheritance of FH 
is dominant, meaning that the condition is inherited from one parent, 
and  ~50%  of  the  patient’s  siblings  and  children  can  be  expected  to 
have FH. For this reason, family-based “cascade screening” can be very 
effective in identifying additional persons with FH. Physical findings 
in some, but not all, patients with FH may include corneal arcus and/or 
tendon xanthomas, particularly involving the dorsum of the hands and 
the  Achilles  tendons.  Untreated  heterozygous  FH  is  associated  with 
a  markedly  increased  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease;  untreated  men 
with  heterozygous  FH  have  an  ~50%  chance  of  having  a  myocardial 
infarction before age 60 years, and women with heterozygous FH are at 
substantially increased risk as well. The age of onset of cardiovascular 
disease is highly variable and depends on the specific molecular defect, 
the level of LDL-C, and coexisting cardiovascular risk factors.

The diagnosis of FH is generally a clinical diagnosis based on hyper-
cholesterolemia with LDL-C >190 mg/dL in the absence of a secondary 
etiology and ideally with a family history of hypercholesterolemia and/
or premature ASCVD. Secondary causes of significant hypercholester-
olemia such as hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, and obstructive 
liver  disease  should  be  excluded.  Sequencing  of  an  FH  gene  panel 
(LDLR, APOB, PCSK9) to confirm the diagnosis is widely available and 
worthy of consideration; persons with molecularly confirmed FH are at 
higher risk of ASCVD and therefore may benefit from more aggressive 
treatment, and the finding of a specific causal variant has implications 
for family-based cascade screening.

FH patients should be actively treated to lower plasma levels of LDL-
C, preferably starting in childhood. Initiation of a diet low in saturated 
and trans fats is recommended, but heterozygous FH patients almost 
always  require  pharmacologic  therapy  for  effective  control  of  their 
LDL-C  levels.  Statins  are  the  initial  drug  class  of  choice,  and  usually 
“high-intensity”  statin  therapy  is  needed.  Many  FH  patients  cannot 
achieve adequate control of their LDL-C levels even with high-inten-
sity statin therapy, and a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe), 
a  PCSK9  inhibitor,  an  ACL  inhibitor  (bempedoic  acid),  and  a  bile 
acid sequestrant are other classes of drugs that can be added to statins 
(Table  407-4).  Some  patients  with  severe  heterozygous  FH  cannot 
be  adequately  managed  using  existing  therapies  and  are  candidates 
for LDL apheresis, a physical method of purging the blood of LDL in 
which the LDL particles are selectively removed from the circulation. 
Other novel approaches for these patients are under development.

Homozygous FH (HoFH) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in 
both alleles of the LDL receptor or double heterozygosity for mutations 
in two FH genes. Patients with HoFH have been classified into those 
with  virtually  no  detectable  LDL  receptor  activity  (receptor  negative) 
and  patients  with  markedly  reduced  but  detectable  LDL  receptor 
activity  (receptor  defective).  Untreated  LDL-C  levels  in  patients  with 
HoFH  range  from  ~400  to  >1000  mg/dL,  with  receptor-defective 
patients at the lower end and receptor-negative patients at the higher 
end of the range. TGs are usually relatively normal. Some patients with 
HoFH,  particularly  receptor-negative  patients,  present  in  childhood 
with cutaneous planar xanthomas on the hands, wrists, elbows, knees, 
heels, or buttocks. The devastating consequence of HoFH is accelerated 
ASCVD, which often presents in childhood or early adulthood. Ath-
erosclerosis often develops first in the aortic root, where it can cause 

aortic valvular or supravalvular stenosis, and typically extends into the 
coronary ostia, which become stenotic. Symptoms can be atypical, and 
sudden death is not uncommon. Untreated, receptor-negative patients 
with  HoFH  rarely  survive  beyond  the  second  decade;  patients  with 
receptor-defective  LDL  receptor  defects  have  a  better  prognosis  but 
almost  invariably  develop  clinically  apparent  atherosclerotic  vascular 
disease by age 30 and often much sooner.

HoFH  should  be  suspected  in  a  child  or  young  adult  with  LDL 
>400  mg/dL  without  secondary  cause.  Cutaneous  xanthomas,  evi-
dence of ASCVD, and/or hypercholesterolemia in both parents all are 
supportive  of  the  diagnosis.  While  the  diagnosis  is  usually  made  on 
clinical grounds, genetic testing should be performed to identify spe-
cific causal variants. Patients with HoFH must be treated aggressively 
to delay the onset and progression of CVD. Although receptor-negative 
patients  have  no  response  to  statins  and  PCSK9  inhibitors,  receptor- 
defective patients can have modest responses to these medicines, and 
they should be tried in patients with HoFH. Two drugs that reduce the 
hepatic  production  of  VLDL  and  thus  LDL,  a  small-molecule  inhib-
itor  of  the  microsomal  TG  transfer  protein  (MTP)  and  an  antisense 
oligonucleotide to apoB, and an antibody that inhibits ANGPLT3 are 
approved for the treatment of patients with HoFH and should be con-
sidered in patients who have insufficient response to statins and PCSK9 
inhibitors. LDL apheresis should be considered in HoFH patients who 
have  persistently  elevated  LDL-C  levels  despite  drug  therapy.  Liver 
transplantation is effective in decreasing plasma LDL-C levels in this 
disorder  and  is  sometimes  used  as  a  last  resort.  Liver-directed  gene 
therapy is under development for HoFH, as are other new therapeutic 
approaches intended to address the remaining unmet medical need.

FH  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder.  There  are  a  few  rare  con-
ditions  that  cause  an  FH-like  phenotype  in  an  autosomal  recessive 
manner and should be considered in patients with severe hypercholes-
terolemia who do not report a family history of hypercholesterolemia 
or premature CHD.
AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (ARH)  ARH is a 
very  rare  autosomal  recessive  disorder  that  was  originally  reported  in 
individuals of Sardinian descent. The disease is caused by mutations in 
the  gene  LDLRAP1  encoding  the  protein  LDLR  adaptor  protein  (also 
called the ARH protein), which is required for LDL receptor–mediated 
endocytosis in the liver. LDLRAP1 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of 
the LDL receptor and links the receptor to the endocytic machinery. In 
the absence of LDLRAP1, LDL binds to the extracellular domain of the 
LDL receptor, but the lipoprotein-receptor complex fails to be internal-
ized. ARH, like HoFH, is characterized by hypercholesterolemia, tendon 
xanthomas, and premature coronary artery disease (CAD). The levels of 
plasma LDL-C tend to be intermediate between the levels present in FH 
homozygotes and FH heterozygotes, and CAD is not usually symptom-
atic until the third decade. LDL receptor function in cultured fibroblasts 
is  normal  or  only  modestly  reduced  in  ARH,  whereas  LDL  receptor 
function in the liver is negligible. Unlike FH homozygotes, the hyperlipi-
demia responds to treatment with statins, but these patients often require 
additional therapy to lower plasma LDL-C to acceptable levels.

SITOSTEROLEMIA  Sitosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive disease 
that is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in either of two 
members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) half transporter family, 
ABCG5  and  ABCG8.  These  genes  are  expressed  in  both  enterocytes 
and  hepatocytes.  The  proteins  heterodimerize  to  form  a  functional 
complex  that  transports  plant  sterols  such  as  sitosterol  and  campes-
terol, and animal sterols, predominantly cholesterol, across the apical 
biliary  membrane  of  hepatocytes  into  the  bile  and  across  the  apical 
luminal membrane of enterocytes into the gut lumen, thus reducing 
their  (re)absorption  and  promoting  their  excretion.  In  normal  indi-
viduals,  <5%  of  dietary  plant  sterols  are  absorbed  by  the  proximal 
small  intestine.  The  small  amounts  of  plant  sterols  that  enter  the 
circulation are preferentially excreted into the bile, and thus, levels of 
plant sterols are kept very low in tissues. In sitosterolemia, the intesti-
nal absorption of sterols is increased and biliary and fecal excretion of 
the sterols is reduced, resulting in increased plasma and tissue levels 
of  both  plant  sterols  and  cholesterol.  The  increase  in  hepatic  sterol

levels  results  in  transcriptional  suppression  of  the  expression  of  the 
LDL  receptor,  resulting  in  reduced  uptake  of  LDL  and  substantially 
increased  LDL-C  levels.  In  addition  to  the  clinical  picture  of  severe 
hypercholesterolemia, often accompanied by tendon xanthomas and 
premature ASCVD, these patients also have anisocytosis and poikilo-
cytosis of erythrocytes and megathrombocytes due to the incorpora-
tion of plant sterols into cell membranes. Episodes of hemolysis and 
splenomegaly are a distinctive clinical feature of this disease compared 
to other genetic forms of hypercholesterolemia and can be a clue to 
the  diagnosis.  Sitosterolemia  should  be  suspected  in  a  patient  with 
severe hypercholesterolemia without a family history of such or who 
fails to respond to statin therapy. Sitosterolemia can be diagnosed by 
a laboratory finding of a substantial increase in plasma sitosterol and/
or other plant sterols and should be confirmed by gene sequencing of 
ABCG5  and  ABCG8.  It  is  important  to  make  the  diagnosis,  because 
diet, bile acid sequestrants, and cholesterol-absorption inhibitors are 

the  most  effective  agents  to  reduce  LDL-C  and  plasma  plant  sterol 
levels  in  these  patients.  Of  note,  heterozygosity  for  mutations  in 
ABCG5  or  ABCG8  is  now  recognized  to  cause  a  moderate  form  of 
hypercholesterolemia.

LYSOSOMAL  ACID  LIPASE  DEFICIENCY  (LALD)  LALD,  also  known 
as  cholesteryl  ester  storage  disease,  is  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder 
caused  by  loss-of-function  variants  in  both  alleles  of  the  gene  LIPA 
encoding the enzyme lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). LAL is responsible 
for hydrolyzing neutral lipids, particularly TGs and CEs, after delivery 
to the lysosome by cell surface receptors such as the LDL receptor. It 
is  particularly  important  in  the  liver,  which  clears  large  amounts  of 
lipoproteins  from  the  circulation.  LALD  is  characterized  by  elevated 
LDL-C, usually in association with low HDL-C and with variably ele-
vated TG levels, together with progressive fatty liver ultimately leading 
to hepatic fibrosis. Genetic deficiency of LAL results in accumulation

of  neutral  lipid  in  the  hepatocytes,  leading  to  hepatosplenomegaly, 
microvesicular steatosis, and ultimately fibrosis and end-stage liver dis-
ease. The most severe form of this disorder, Wolman’s disease, presents 
in  infancy  and  is  rapidly  fatal.  The  etiology  of  the  elevated  LDL-C 
levels is primarily due to impaired LDL receptor–mediated clearance 
of LDL. LALD should be suspected in nonobese patients with elevated 
LDL-C, low HDL-C, and evidence of fatty liver in the absence of overt 
insulin resistance. The diagnosis can be made with a dried blood spot 
assay of LAL activity and confirmed by DNA genotyping for the most 
common mutation, followed if necessary by sequencing of the gene to 
find the second mutation. Liver biopsy is required to assess the degree 
of inflammation and fibrosis. LALD is underdiagnosed; it is critically 
important  to  suspect  it  and  make  the  diagnosis  because  enzyme 
replacement therapy with sebelipase alfa is now available and is highly 
effective in treating this condition.

The  above  conditions  primarily  cause  elevations  in  LDL  due  to 
impaired catabolism of LDL from the blood. There are a few forms of 
primary  dyslipidemia  that  impair  the  catabolism  of  “remnant”  TRLs 
(after their processing by LPL) and therefore cause elevations in both 
cholesterol and TGs due to remnant accumulation.

Multifactorial  Hypercholesterolemia  Most  patients  with  ele-
vated LDL-C do not have a single-gene disorder, as described above, 
but  instead  have  a  multifactorial  etiology  that  includes  genetics  and 
environment.  Genetic  variation  contributes  substantially  to  elevated 
LDL-C  levels  in  the  general  population.  It  has  been  estimated  that 
at  least  50%  of  variation  in  LDL-C  is  genetically  determined.  Many 
patients with elevated LDL-C have polygenic hypercholesterolemia due 
to  multiple  common  genetic  variants  exerting  modest  LDL-raising 
effects. Individuals at the tail of the highest burden of polygenic risk 
score for LDL-C often have LDL-C levels that are similar to those with 
FH. In patients who are genetically predisposed to higher LDL-C levels, 
diet plays a key exacerbating role; indeed, increased saturated and trans 
fats in the diet shift the entire distribution of LDL-C levels in the popu-
lation to the right. As described in more detail below, patients with ele-
vated LDL-C should be carefully assessed for their risk of ASCVD and 
managed with lifestyle modification and LDL-lowering medications as 
needed to reduce LDL-C and risk of ASCVD.

 ■ MIXED HYPERLIPIDEMIA (ELEVATED TG  
AND LDL-C)
Mixed  hyperlipidemia  can  be  defined  as  fasting  TGs  >150  mg/dL 
and evidence of elevated cholesterol-containing lipoproteins (such as 
LDL-C >130 mg/dL or non-HDL-C >160 mg/dL). It is one of the most 
common types of lipid disorders seen in clinical practice, due both to 
genetic predisposition and influence of medical conditions and envi-
ronmental factors (see below). It is generally associated with elevated 
risk  of  ASCVD,  and  therefore,  patients  with  mixed  hyperlipidemia 
should be carefully evaluated and managed to reduce this risk.

Primary (Genetic) Causes of Mixed Hyperlipidemia  •  FAMILIAL 
DYSBETALIPOPROTEINEMIA  (FDBL)  FDBL  (also  known  as  type  III 
hyperlipoproteinemia) is a recessive disorder characterized by a mixed 
hyperlipidemia  due  to  the  accumulation  of  remnant  lipoprotein  par-
ticles  (chylomicron  remnants  and  VLDL  remnants,  or  IDL).  ApoE 
is  present  in  multiple  copies  on  chylomicron  remnants  and  IDL  and 
mediates their removal via hepatic lipoprotein receptors (Fig. 407-2). 
The APOE gene is polymorphic in sequence, resulting in the expression 
of three common isoforms: apoE3, which is the most common (~78% 
global  allele  frequency  [AF]),  apoE4  (~14%  global  AF),  and  apoE2 
(~8% global AF). The apoE4 allele, which has an arginine instead of a 
cysteine at position 112, is widely known for being the major genetic 
risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. It is associated with slightly higher 
LDL-C  levels  and  increased  ASCVD  risk  but  is  not  associated  with 
FDBL. The apoE2 allele, which has a cysteine at position 158 instead of 
an arginine, is the cause of FDBL when present on both alleles. ApoE2 
has a lower affinity for the LDL receptor; therefore, chylomicron rem-
nants and IDL containing apoE2 are removed from plasma at a slower 
rate, leading to their accumulation in blood.

Approximately  0.5%  of  the  general  population  are  apoE2/E2 
homozygotes,  but  only  a  small  minority  of  these  individuals  actually 
develop  hyperlipidemia  characteristic  of  FDBL  (which  has  a  preva-
lence  of  ~1  in  10,000).  Thus,  an  additional,  sometimes  identifiable, 
factor  precipitates  the  development  of  overt  dysbetalipoproteinemia 
in  apoE2/E2  homozygotes.  The  most  common  precipitating  factors 
are a high-fat diet, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, alcohol use, menopause, 
diabetes  mellitus,  hypothyroidism,  renal  disease,  HIV  infection,  or 
certain drugs. Certain dominant-negative mutations in apoE can cause 
a dominant form of FDBL where the hyperlipidemia is fully manifest in 
the heterozygous state, but these mutations are very rare.

Patients  with  FDBL  usually  present  in  adulthood  with  hyperlip-
idemia,  xanthomas,  or  premature  coronary  or  peripheral  vascular 
disease. In FDBL, in contrast to other disorders of elevated TGs, the 
plasma  levels  of  cholesterol  and  TG  are  often  elevated  to  a  similar 
degree, and the level of HDL-C is usually normal. Two distinctive types 
of xanthomas, tuberoeruptive and palmar, are seen in FDBL patients. 
Tuberoeruptive  xanthomas  begin  as  clusters  of  small  papules  on  the 
elbows,  knees,  or  buttocks  and  can  grow  to  the  size  of  small  grapes. 
Palmar  xanthomas  (alternatively  called  xanthomata  striata  palmaris) 
are orange-yellow discolorations of the creases in the palms and wrists. 
Both of these xanthoma types are virtually pathognomonic for FDBL. 
Subjects  with  FDBL  have  premature  ASCVD  and  tend  to  have  more 
peripheral vascular disease than is typically seen in FH.

The definitive diagnosis of FDBL can be made either by the docu-
mentation of very high levels of remnant lipoproteins or by identifica-
tion of the apoE2/E2 genotype. A variety of methods are used to identify 
remnant  lipoproteins  in  the  plasma,  including  “β-quantification”  by 
ultracentrifugation  (ratio  of  directly  measured  VLDL  cholesterol  to 
total  plasma  TG  >0.30),  lipoprotein  electrophoresis  (broad  β  band), 
or  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  lipoprotein  profiling.  The  Friedewald 
formula  for  calculation  of  LDL-C  is  not  valid  in  FDBL  because  the 
VLDL particles are depleted in TG and enriched in cholesterol. The 
plasma levels of LDL-C are actually low in this disorder due to defec-
tive metabolism of VLDL to LDL. DNA-based apoE genotyping can be 
performed to confirm homozygosity for apoE2, which is diagnostic for 
FDBL.  However,  absence  of  the  apoE2/E2  genotype  does  not  strictly 
rule out the diagnosis of FDBL, because other mutations in apoE can 
(rarely) cause this condition.

Because  FDBL  is  associated  with  increased  risk  of  premature 
ASCVD, it should be treated aggressively. Other metabolic conditions 
that can exacerbate the hyperlipidemia (see above) should be managed. 
Patients  with  FDBL  are  typically  diet-responsive  and  can  respond 
favorably  to  low-cholesterol,  low-fat  diets  and  weight  reduction. 
Alcohol  intake  should  be  curtailed.  Pharmacologic  therapy  is  often 
required, and statins are the first line in management. In the event of 
statin intolerance or insufficient control of hyperlipidemia, cholesterol 
absorption inhibitors, PCSK9 inhibitors, and fibrates are also effective 
in the treatment of FDBL.
HEPATIC  LIPASE  DEFICIENCY  Hepatic  lipase  (HL;  gene  name  LIPC) 
is a member of the same gene family as LPL and hydrolyzes TGs and 
phospholipids in remnant lipoproteins and HDL. Hydrolysis of lipids 
in remnant particles by HL contributes to their hepatic uptake via an 
apoE-mediated process. HL deficiency is a very rare autosomal reces-
sive  disorder  caused  by  biallelic  loss-of-function  mutations  in  LIPC. 
It  is  characterized  by  elevated  plasma  levels  of  cholesterol  and  TGs 
(mixed hyperlipidemia) due to the accumulation of lipoprotein rem-
nants, accompanied by elevated plasma level of HDL-C. The diagnosis 
is confirmed by confirmation of pathogenic mutations in both alleles 
of LIPC. Due to the small number of patients with HL deficiency, the 
association  of  this  genetic  defect  with  ASCVD  is  not  entirely  clear, 
although anecdotally, patients with HL deficiency who have premature 
CVD  have  been  described.  As  with  FDBL,  statin  therapy  is  recom-
mended to reduce remnant lipoproteins and cardiovascular risk.

FAMILIAL  COMBINED  HYPERLIPIDEMIA  (FCHL)  FCHL  is  one  of  the 
most  common  familial  lipid  disorders;  it  is  estimated  to  occur  in  ~1 
in 100–200 individuals. FCHL is characterized by elevations in plasma 
levels of TGs (VLDL) and LDL-C (including especially a small dense

3144 form of LDL) and reduced plasma levels of HDL-C. This disorder is 
an  important  contributor  to  premature  CHD;  ~20%  of  patients  who 
develop CHD under age 60 have FCHL. FCHL can manifest in child-
hood  but  is  usually  not  fully  expressed  until  adulthood.  The  disease 
clusters  in  families,  and  affected  family  members  typically  have  one 
of three possible phenotypes: (1) elevated plasma levels of LDL-C, (2) 
elevated plasma levels of TGs due to elevation in VLDL, or (3) elevated 
plasma  levels  of  both  LDL-C  and  TG.  The  lipoprotein  profile  can 
switch among these three phenotypes in the same individual over time 
and may depend on factors such as diet, exercise, weight, and insulin 
sensitivity. Patients with FCHL have substantially elevated plasma lev-
els of apoB, often disproportionately high relative to the plasma LDL-C 
concentration,  indicating  the  presence  of  small  dense  LDL  particles, 
which are characteristic of this syndrome.

Individuals with this phenotype generally share the same metabolic 
defect,  namely  overproduction  of  VLDL  and  apoB  by  the  liver.  The 
molecular  etiology  of  this  condition  remains  poorly  understood,  and 
no  single  gene  has  been  identified  in  which  mutations  convincingly 
cause this disorder in a simple Mendelian fashion. It is likely that defects 
in  a  combination  of  genes  can  cause  the  condition,  suggesting  that  a 
more  appropriate  term  for  the  disorder  might  be  polygenic  combined 
hyperlipidemia.

The  presence  of  a  mixed  dyslipidemia  (plasma  TG  levels  between 
150  and  500  mg/dL  and  total  cholesterol  levels  between  200 
and  400  mg/dL,  usually  with  HDL-C  levels  <40  mg/dL  in  men  and 
<50 mg/dL in women) and a family history of mixed dyslipidemia and/
or  premature  CHD  suggests  the  diagnosis.  Measurement  of  plasma 
apoB  levels  can  help  support  the  diagnosis  if  they  are  substantially 
elevated, particularly relative to the LDL-C level. Individuals with this 
disorder should be treated aggressively due to significantly increased 
risk  of  premature  CHD,  often  disproportionate  to  the  LDL-C  level. 
Decreased  dietary  intake  of  simple  carbohydrates,  increased  aerobic 
exercise,  and  weight  loss  can  all  have  beneficial  effects  on  the  lipid 
profile. Patients with type 2 diabetes should be aggressively treated to 
maintain good glucose control. Virtually all patients with FCHL merit 
lipid-lowering  drug  therapy  to  reduce  apoB-containing  lipoprotein 
levels  and  lower  the  risk  of  ASCVD.  High-intensity  statins  are  first 
line, but many patients with FCHL require combination therapy that 
includes ezetimibe, a PCSK9 inhibitor, and/or bempedoic acid.

 ■ SECONDARY CONTRIBUTORS TO ELEVATED 
LEVELS OF APOB-CONTAINING LIPOPROTEINS
There  are  many  “secondary”  factors  that  contribute  to  dyslipidemia 
(Table  407-3),  often  acting  in  concert  with  polygenic  predisposition 
as  reviewed  above.  Some  primarily  affect  TGs,  some  primarily  affect 
LDL-C, and some influence both, with a great deal of variability. Here 
the major secondary contributors are reviewed.

Secondary Factors That Primarily Elevate TG Levels  •  HIGH-
CARBOHYDRATE  DIET  Dietary  carbohydrates  are  utilized  as  a  sub-
strate for fatty acid synthesis in the liver. Some of the newly synthesized 
fatty  acids  are  esterified,  forming  TGs,  and  secreted  in  VLDL.  Thus, 
excessive  intake  of  calories  as  carbohydrates,  which  is  frequent  in 
Western societies, leads to increased hepatic VLDL-TG secretion and 
elevated TG levels. Reduction in carbohydrate consumption can have 
a substantial effect in reducing TG levels, although replacing carbohy-
drates with saturated fat can elevate LDL-C levels.

OBESITY,  INSULIN  RESISTANCE,  AND  TYPE  2  DIABETES  (See  also 
Chaps. 401–403) Obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mel-
litus  are  the  most  frequent  contributors  to  dyslipidemia,  primarily  by 
influencing  TGs.  The  increase  in  adipocyte  mass  and  accompanying 
decreased  insulin  sensitivity  associated  with  obesity  have  multiple 
effects on lipid metabolism, with one of the major effects being excessive 
hepatic VLDL production. More free fatty acids are delivered from the 
expanded and insulin-resistant adipose tissue to the liver, where they are 
reesterified in hepatocytes to form TGs, which are packaged into VLDLs 
for secretion into the circulation. In addition, the increased insulin lev-
els promote increased fatty acid synthesis in the liver. In insulin-resistant 

patients who progress to type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia remains 
common, even when the patient is under relatively good glycemic con-
trol. In addition to increased VLDL production, insulin resistance can 
also result in decreased LPL activity, resulting in reduced catabolism of 
chylomicrons and VLDLs and more severe HTG. This may be due in 
part to the effects of tissue insulin resistance leading to reduced tran-
scription of LPL in skeletal muscle and adipose, as well as to increased 
production of the LPL inhibitor apoC-III by the liver. This reduction in 
LPL activity often exacerbates the effects of increased VLDL production 
and contributes to the dyslipidemia seen in these patients. The dyslip-
idemia in this setting is almost invariable associated with low HDL-C 
levels as well. A cluster of metabolic risk factors are often found together, 
including obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, high TGs, and low 
HDL-C (the so-called “metabolic syndrome,” Chap. 408).

ALCOHOL  CONSUMPTION  Excessive  alcohol  consumption  inhibits 
hepatic oxidation of free fatty acids, thus promoting hepatic TG syn-
thesis and VLDL secretion and leading to increased plasma TG levels. 
Regular alcohol use also raises plasma levels of HDL-C and should be 
considered in patients with the relatively unusual combination of ele-
vated TGs and normal or elevated HDL-C. A careful history of alcohol 
use should be taken in patients with elevated TGs. Reduction in alcohol 
consumption can often have a substantial effect in reducing TG levels.
CHRONIC  KIDNEY  DISEASE  (See  also  Chap.  311)  Chronic  kidney 
disease  (CKD)  is  often  associated  with  mild  HTG  (150–400  mg/dL) 
due  to  the  accumulation  of  VLDLs  and  remnant  lipoproteins  in  the 
circulation.  TG  lipolysis  and  remnant  clearance  are  both  reduced  in 
patients with renal failure. Because the risk of ASCVD is increased in 
CKD,  patients  should  usually  be  treated  with  lipid-lowering  agents, 
particularly statins.
ESTROGEN AND OTHER DRUGS  Many drugs have an impact on lipid 
metabolism and can result in significant alterations in the lipoprotein 
profile (Table 407-3). Estrogens often elevate TG levels, and TG levels 
can also increase during pregnancy. In women with HTG, plasma TG 
levels should be monitored when birth control pills or postmenopausal 
estrogen  therapy  is  initiated  and  during  pregnancy.  Use  of  low-dose 
preparations of estrogen or the estrogen patch can minimize the effect 
of  exogenous  estrogen  on  lipids.  Isotretinoin  therapy  for  acne  can 
cause substantial elevations in TGs, and TG levels should be checked 
at baseline and after initiation of therapy. Bexarotene therapy for cuta-
neous T-cell lymphoma often causes substantial increases in TGs, and 
patients should be monitored accordingly.

Secondary Factors That Elevate LDL-C Levels  •  DIET HIGH 
IN  SATURATED  AND  TRANS  FATS  Dietary  saturated  and  trans  fats 
act  to  downregulate  LDL  receptor  expression  in  the  liver,  leading  to 
elevation in LDL-C levels and increased ASCVD risk. A careful dietary 
history  should  be  taken  in  individuals  with  elevated  LDL-C  with  a 
focus on sources of saturated and trans fats. Reduction in consumption 
of saturated and trans fats can sometimes have a substantial effect in 
reducing LDL-C levels and is a cornerstone of the initial nonpharma-
cologic management of hypercholesterolemia.
HYPOTHYROIDISM  (See also Chap. 382) Hypothyroidism is the most 
important  secondary  factor  causing  elevated  LDL-C  levels.  It  causes 
elevated  plasma  LDL-C  levels  due  to  downregulation  of  the  hepatic 
LDL  receptor,  which  is  normally  increased  by  the  action  of  thyroid 
hormone.  Because  hypothyroidism  is  often  subtle  and  therefore  eas-
ily  overlooked,  all  patients  presenting  with  elevated  plasma  levels  of 
LDL-C, especially if there has been an unexplained increase in LDL-C, 
should be screened for hypothyroidism by measuring thyroid-stimu-
lating  hormone  (TSH).  Thyroid  replacement  therapy  usually  reduces 
LDL-C  levels;  if  not,  the  patient  probably  has  a  primary  lipoprotein 
disorder and may require lipid-lowering drug therapy with a statin.

LIVER DISORDERS  (See also Chap. 336) Cholestasis is almost invari-
ably  associated  with  hypercholesterolemia  due  to  elevated  LDL-C 
levels and sometimes particles called Lp-X. A major pathway by which 
cholesterol is excreted from the body is via secretion into bile, either 
directly  or  after  conversion  to  bile  acids,  and  cholestasis  blocks  this

critical  excretory  pathway.  The  increase  in  hepatocellular  cholesterol 
results  in  downregulation  of  the  LDL  receptor,  leading  to  increased 
plasma  LDL-C  levels.  In  severe  cholestasis,  excess  free  cholesterol, 
coupled  with  phospholipids,  is  shed  into  the  plasma  as  a  constituent 
of a lamellar particle called Lp-X. These unusual particles, which are 
not lipoproteins, lack apoB, and have an aqueous and not neutral lipid 
core, are rich in free cholesterol, and can deposit in the skin, producing 
xanthomas  sometimes  seen  in  patients  with  cholestasis.  Some  liver 
disorders  can  affect  plasma  lipid  levels  in  other  ways.  Viral  hepatitis 
can  increase  TGs,  and  liver  failure  can  result  in  reduction  in  plasma 
cholesterol and TGs.

NEPHROTIC  SYNDROME  (See  also  Chap.  311)  Nephrotic  syndrome 
is  a  classic  cause  of  excessive  VLDL  production  leading  to  elevation 
in  both  TGs  and  LDL-C.  The  molecular  mechanism  of  VLDL  over-
production  remains  poorly  understood  but  has  been  attributed  to 
the  effects  of  hypoalbuminemia  leading  to  increased  hepatic  protein 
synthesis.  Effective  treatment  of  the  underlying  renal  disease  may 
normalize the lipid profile, but many patients with chronic nephrotic 
syndrome require lipid-lowering drug therapy with statins and some-
times additional drugs.
CUSHING’S SYNDROME  (See also Chap. 386) Endogenous glucocorti-
coid excess in Cushing’s syndrome is associated with increased VLDL 
synthesis and secretion leading to dyslipidemia characterized by HTG 
and elevated LDL-C. Treatment of the underlying cause is often suffi-
cient to manage the dyslipidemia, but sometimes lipid-lowering drug 
therapy is needed.
IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE  THERAPY  AND  CORTICOSTEROIDS  Several 
of  the  immunosuppressants  used  after  solid  organ  transplantation, 
including  cyclosporin  and  sirolimus,  can  cause  substantial  elevation 
in LDL-C and TG levels. These patients can present a difficult clini-
cal  management  problem.  Chronic  corticosteroid  use,  whether  after 
transplant  or  in  other  inflammatory  conditions,  can  also  result  in 
elevations in LDL-C and TG levels, sometimes producing a substantial 
mixed dyslipidemia. When the immunosuppressant or steroid must be 
continued, which is often the case, drug therapy with statins may be 
indicated in certain patients, with careful attention to the potential for 
untoward muscle-related side effects.

 ■ DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED  
APOB-CONTAINING LIPOPROTEINS
Plasma  concentrations  of  LDL-C  <60  mg/dL  are  unusual.  Although 
in some cases, LDL-C levels in this range may be reflective of malnu-
trition  or  serious  chronic  illness,  LDL-C  <60  mg/dL  in  an  otherwise 
healthy  individual  suggests  an  inherited  condition.  The  major  inher-
ited causes of low LDL-C are reviewed here and listed in Table 407-2.

Abetalipoproteinemia  The synthesis and secretion of apoB-con-
taining  lipoproteins  in  the  enterocytes  of  the  proximal  small  bowel 
and in the hepatocytes of the liver involve a complex series of events 
that coordinate the coupling of various lipids with apoB-48 and apoB-
100,  respectively.  Abetalipoproteinemia  is  a  rare  autosomal  recessive 
disease  caused  by  loss-of-function  mutations  in  the  gene  encoding 
microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP; gene name MTTP), a protein 
that transfers lipids to nascent chylomicrons and VLDLs in the intes-
tine  and  liver,  respectively.  Plasma  levels  of  cholesterol  and  TG  are 
extremely low in this disorder, and chylomicrons, VLDLs, LDLs, and 
apoB are undetectable in plasma. The parents of patients with abetali-
poproteinemia (obligate heterozygotes) have normal plasma lipid and 
apoB levels. Abetalipoproteinemia usually presents in early childhood 
with diarrhea and failure to thrive due to fat malabsorption. The initial 
neurologic manifestations are loss of deep tendon reflexes, followed by 
decreased  distal  lower  extremity  vibratory  and  proprioceptive  sense, 
dysmetria, ataxia, and the development of a spastic gait, often by the 
third or fourth decade. Patients with abetalipoproteinemia also develop 
a progressive pigmented retinopathy presenting with decreased night 
and color vision, followed by reductions in daytime visual acuity and 
ultimately  progressing  to  near-blindness.  The  presence  of  spinocer-
ebellar  degeneration  and  pigmented  retinopathy  in  this  disease  has 

resulted  in  some  patients  with  abetalipoproteinemia  being  misdiag-
nosed as having Friedreich’s ataxia.

Most  of  the  clinical  manifestations  of  abetalipoproteinemia  result 
from  defects  in  the  absorption  and  transport  of  fat-soluble  vitamins. 
Vitamin E and retinyl esters are normally transported from enterocytes 
to the liver by chylomicrons, and vitamin E is dependent on VLDL for 
transport  out  of  the  liver  and  into  the  circulation.  As  a  consequence 
of  the  inability  of  these  patients  to  secrete  apoB-containing  particles, 
patients  with  abetalipoproteinemia  are  markedly  deficient  in  vitamin 
E  and  are  also  mildly  to  moderately  deficient  in  vitamins  A  and  K. 
Patients  with  abetalipoproteinemia  should  be  referred  to  specialized 
centers  for  confirmation  of  the  diagnosis  and  appropriate  therapy. 
Treatment  consists  of  a  low-fat,  high-caloric,  vitamin-enriched  diet 
accompanied by large supplemental doses of vitamin E. It is imperative 
that treatment be initiated as soon as possible to prevent development 
of neurologic sequelae, which can progress even with high-dose vitamin 
E therapy. New therapies for this serious, albeit rare, disease are needed. 
The discovery that genetic loss of MTP causes absent LDL-C led to the 
development of an MTP inhibitor to treat homozygous FH (see below).

Familial  Hypobetalipoproteinemia  (FHBL)  FHBL  generally 
refers  to  a  condition  of  low  total  cholesterol,  LDL-C,  and  apoB  due 
to mutations in the APOB gene. Most of the mutations causing FHBL 
result in a truncated apoB protein, resulting in impaired assembly and 
secretion of chylomicrons from enterocytes and VLDL from the liver. 
Any secreted VLDL particles containing a truncated apoB protein are 
cleared from the circulation at an accelerated rate, which also contrib-
utes  to  the  low  levels  of  LDL-C  and  apoB.  Individuals  heterozygous 
for  these  mutations  usually  have  LDL-C  levels  <60–80  mg/dL  and 
also tend to have low levels of plasma TG. Many FHBL patients have 
elevated levels of hepatic fat (due to reduced VLDL export) and some-
times have increased levels of liver transaminases, although it appears 
that these patients infrequently develop associated hepatic inflamma-
tion and fibrosis.

Truncating mutations in both apoB alleles cause homozygous FHBL, 
an extremely rare disorder resembling abetalipoproteinemia with nearly 
undetectable LDL-C and apoB. The neurologic defects in homozygous 
hypobetalipoproteinemia are similar to those seen in abetalipoproteine-
mia, but tend to be less severe. Homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia 
can  be  distinguished  from  abetalipoproteinemia  by  examining  the 
inheritance  pattern  of  the  plasma  LDL-C  level.  The  levels  of  LDL-C 
and apoB are normal in the parents of patients with abetalipoproteine-
mia,  a  classic  recessive  condition,  and  low  in  those  of  patients  with 
homozygous  hypobetalipoproteinemia,  a  co-dominant  condition.  The 
discovery that truncating mutations in apoB reduce LDL-C led to the 
development of an antisense oligonucleotide to treat HoFH (see below).

Familial  PCSK9  Deficiency  Another  inherited  cause  of  low 
LDL-C  results  from  loss-of-function  mutations  in  PCSK9.  PCSK9  is 
a  secreted  protein  that  binds  to  the  extracellular  domain  of  the  LDL 
receptor in the liver and promotes the degradation of the receptor. Hete-
rozygosity for nonsense mutations in PCSK9 that interfere with the syn-
thesis of the protein are associated with increased hepatic LDL receptor 
activity and reduced plasma levels of LDL-C. Such mutations are more 
frequent  in  individuals  of  African  descent.  Individuals  who  are  hete-
rozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in PCSK9 have an ~30–40% 
reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C and have a substantial protection 
from CHD relative to those without a PCSK9 mutation, presumably due 
to having lower plasma cholesterol levels since birth. Homozygotes for 
these nonsense mutations have been reported and have extremely low 
LDL-C  levels  (<20  mg/dL)  but  appear  otherwise  healthy.  A  sequence 
variation  of  somewhat  higher  frequency  (R46L)  is  found  predomi-
nantly in individuals of European descent. This mutation impairs, but 
does  not  completely  destroy,  PCSK9  function.  As  a  consequence,  the 
plasma levels of LDL-C in individuals carrying this mutation are more 
modestly reduced (~15–20%); individuals with these mutations have a 
45% reduction in CHD risk. The discovery of this condition led to the 
development of therapies that antagonize or silence PCSK9, thus reduc-
ing LDL-C levels and risk of CHD (see below).

3146 Familial Combined Hypolipidemia  Nonsense mutations in both 
alleles  of  the  gene  angiopoietin-like  3  (ANGPTL3)  lead  to  low  plasma 
levels  of  all  three  major  lipid  fractions—TG,  LDL-C,  and  HDL-C—a 
phenotype termed familial combined hypolipidemia. ANGPTL3 is a pro-
tein synthesized by the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. It inhibits 
LPL, thus delaying clearance of TRLs from the blood and increasing TRL 
blood  concentrations.  Deficiency  of  ANGPTL3,  therefore,  raises  LPL 
activity and lowers blood TG; it also lowers LDL-C and raises HDL-C 
levels apparently related to the effects of ANGPTL3 on endothelial lipase. 
ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated with a reduced risk for CHD. The dis-
covery of this condition led to the development of therapies that antag-
onize or silence ANGPTL3 to reduce LDL-C and TG levels (see below).

DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED 
HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS
Low levels of HDL-C, generally defined as <50 mg/dL in women and 
<40 mg/dL in men, are very common in clinical practice. Low HDL-C 
is  an  important  independent  predictor  of  increased  cardiovascular 
risk  and  has  been  used  regularly  in  standardized  risk  calculators.  As 
an  independent  risk  factor,  it  has  clinical  value  in  the  assessment  of 
cardiovascular  risk,  and  a  patient  with  low  HDL-C  should  generally 
be  considered  at  higher  risk  of  ASCVD.  However,  it  is  now  consid-
ered doubtful that low HDL-C is directly causal for the development 
of ASCVD. Thus, while HDL-C remains an important biomarker for 
assessing cardiovascular risk, it is not considered a particularly attrac-
tive target for therapeutic intervention to raise HDL-C levels in order 
to reduce cardiovascular risk. HDL-targeted therapies that, remain in 
clinical  development  include  a  CETP  inhibitor  and  an  intravenous 
infusion of a lipidated apoA-I particle.

HDL metabolism is strongly influenced by TG metabolism, insulin 
resistance, and inflammation, among other environmental and medical 
factors. Thus, the HDL-C measurement integrates a number of cardio-
vascular risk factors, potentially explaining its strong inverse association 
with  ASCVD.  The  majority  of  patients  with  low  HDL-C  have  some 
combination of genetic predisposition and secondary factors. Variants 
in  hundreds  of  genes  have  been  shown  to  influence  HDL-C  levels. 
Even more important quantitatively, obesity and insulin resistance have 
strong  suppressive  effects  on  HDL-C,  and  low  HDL-C  in  these  con-
ditions  is  widely  observed.  Furthermore,  the  vast  majority  of  patients 
with elevated TGs have reduced levels of HDL-C due to the substantial 
interplay between the metabolism of TRLs and HDL (see above). Most 
patients with low HDL-C who have been studied in detail have acceler-
ated catabolism of HDL and its associated apoA-I protein as the phys-
iologic basis for the low HDL-C. Single-gene Mendelian disorders that 
reduce HDL-C activity have been described (Table 407-2) but are rare; 
the vast majority of patients with low HDL-C have a polygenic predis-
position with secondary factors like obesity, insulin resistance, or HTG.

 ■ PRIMARY (GENETIC) CAUSES OF LOW HDL-C
Mutations in three key genes encoding proteins that play critical roles 
in HDL synthesis and catabolism result in hypoalphalipoproteinemia 
(primary low levels of HDL-C). Unlike the genetic forms of hypercho-
lesterolemia, which are invariably associated with premature coronary 
atherosclerosis, genetic forms of hypoalphalipoproteinemia are usually 
not associated with clearly increased risk of ASCVD. Nevertheless, in 
the clinical setting of an HDL-C level <20 mg/dL without accompany-
ing severe HTG, these rare conditions should be considered.

Gene  Deletions  and  Missense  Mutations  in  APOA1  Com-
plete  genetic  deficiency  of  apoA-I  due  to  a  complete  deletion  of  the 
APOA1 gene results in the virtual absence of circulating HDL, proving 
the critical role of apoA-I in HDL biogenesis. The APOA1 gene is part 
of a gene cluster on chromosome 11 that includes APOA5, APOC3, and 
APOA4. Some patients with no apoA-I have large genomic deletions 
that include other genes in the cluster. The rare patient lacking apoA-I 
can  have  cholesterol  deposits  in  the  cornea  and  in  the  skin,  and  in 
contrast to the other genetic disorders of low HDL-C, premature CHD 
has  been  reported.  Heterozygotes  for  apoA-I  deletions  have  reduced 
HDL-C levels but no obvious clinical sequelae.

More common, but still rare, are heterozygous missense mutations 
in the APOA1 gene associated with low plasma levels of HDL-C. The 
first example reported, and still the best known, is an Arg173Cys sub-
stitution in apoA-I (so-called apoA-IMilano), found in multiple residents 
of a town in northern Italy. Heterozygotes for this mutation have very 
low plasma levels of HDL-C (<25 mg/dL) due to impaired LCAT acti-
vation and accelerated clearance of the HDL particles containing the 
abnormal  apoA-I.  Despite  having  very  low  plasma  levels  of  HDL-C, 
these  individuals  do  not  appear  have  an  increased  risk  of  prema-
ture  CHD  (neither  are  they  protected  against  CHD  as  was  initially 
believed). Multiple other rare APOA1 missense mutations causing low 
HDL-C have been reported. A few of these mutations in  APOA1 (as 
well as some mutations in APOA2) promote the formation of amyloid 
fibrils, causing systemic amyloidosis.

Tangier Disease (ABCA1 Deficiency)  Tangier disease is a rare 
autosomal co-dominant form of extremely low plasma HDL-C levels 
that is caused by mutations in the ABCA1 gene encoding ABCA1, a 
cellular  transporter  that  facilitates  efflux  of  unesterified  cholesterol 
and  phospholipids  from  cells  to  apoA-I  as  an  acceptor  (Fig.  407-3). 
Through transporting cellular lipids, ABCA1 in the hepatocytes and 
intestinal  enterocytes  promotes  the  extracellular  lipidation  of  the 
apoA-I secreted from the basolateral membranes of these tissues. In 
the genetic absence of ABCA1, the nascent, poorly lipidated apoA-I 
is  rapidly  cleared  from  the  circulation.  Thus,  patients  with  Tangier 
disease (both ABCA1 alleles mutated) have extremely low circulating 
plasma levels of HDL-C (<5 mg/dL) and apoA-I (<5 mg/dL). Choles-
terol accumulates in the reticuloendothelial system of these patients, 
resulting in hepatosplenomegaly and pathognomonic enlarged, gray-
ish  yellow  or  orange  tonsils.  An  intermittent  peripheral  neuropathy 
(mononeuritis multiplex) or a sphingomyelia-like neurologic disorder 
can  also  be  seen  in  this  disorder.  Tangier  disease  may  be  associated 
with some increased risk of ASCVD, although the association is not 
as  robust  as  might  have  been  anticipated,  given  the  extremely  low 
levels of HDL-C in these patients. Patients with Tangier disease also 
have  low  plasma  levels  of  LDL-C,  which  may  attenuate  the  athero-
sclerotic  risk.  Heterozygotes  for  ABCA1  mutations  have  moderately 
reduced plasma HDL-C levels (~15–40 mg/dL), and the effect on risk 
of ASCVD remains uncertain.

Familial  LCAT  Deficiency  This  rare  autosomal  recessive  dis-
order is caused by mutations in LCAT, an enzyme synthesized in the 
liver and secreted into the plasma, where it circulates associated with 
lipoproteins (Fig. 407-3). As reviewed above, the enzyme is activated 
by apoA-I and mediates the esterification of cholesterol to form CEs. 
Consequently, in familial LCAT deficiency, the proportion of free cho-
lesterol in circulating lipoproteins is greatly increased (from ~25% to 
>70% of total plasma cholesterol). Deficiency in this enzyme interferes 
with the maturation of HDL particles and results in rapid catabolism 
of circulating apoA-I.

Two genetic forms of familial LCAT deficiency have been described 
in  humans:  complete  deficiency  (also  called  classic  LCAT  deficiency) 
and partial deficiency (also called fish eye disease). Progressive corneal 
opacification  due  to  the  deposition  of  free  cholesterol  in  the  cornea, 
very  low  plasma  levels  of  HDL-C  (usually  <10  mg/dL),  and  variable 
HTG are characteristic of both disorders. In partial LCAT deficiency, 
there are no other known clinical sequelae. In contrast, patients with 
complete  LCAT  deficiency  have  hemolytic  anemia  and  progressive 
renal  insufficiency  that  eventually  leads  to  end-stage  renal  disease. 
Remarkably,  despite  the  extremely  low  plasma  levels  of  HDL-C  and 
apoA-I, premature ASCVD is not a consistent feature of either LCAT 
deficiency or fish eye disease. The diagnosis can be confirmed in a spe-
cialized laboratory by assaying plasma LCAT activity or by sequencing 
the LCAT gene.

Primary  Hypoalphalipoproteinemia  Primary  hypoalphalipo-
proteinemia is defined as a plasma HDL-C level below the tenth per-
centile in the setting of relatively normal cholesterol and TG levels, no 
apparent secondary causes of low plasma HDL-C, and no clinical signs 
of LCAT deficiency or Tangier disease. This syndrome is often referred

to  as  isolated  low  HDL.  A  family  history  of  low  HDL-C  suggests  an 
inherited condition and may trigger an evaluation of one of the Mende-
lian causes of hypoalphalipoproteinemia. However, most patients with 
isolated low HDL do not have an identifiable single-gene disorder and 
likely  have  a  polygenic  etiology,  possibly  exacerbated  by  a  secondary 
factor. The physiologic defect appears to be accelerated catabolism of 
HDL and its apolipoproteins. Several kindreds with primary hypoal-
phalipoproteinemia  and  an  increased  incidence  of  premature  CHD 
have been described, although it is not clear if the low HDL-C level is 
the cause of the accelerated atherosclerosis in these families.

 ■ SECONDARY FACTORS THAT  
REDUCE HDL-C LEVELS
Hypertriglyceridemia  Low  HDL-C  is  very  commonly  found  in 
association  with  elevated  TG  levels.  The  lipolysis  of  TRLs  generates 
lipids that transfer to HDL, and therefore, any impairment of lipolysis 
(the most common cause of elevated TGs) leads to reduced HDL bio-
synthesis. In settings of elevated TGs, where the HDL-C is not reduced, 
alternative explanations (e.g., FDBL, alcohol, estrogens) should be con-
sidered. Conversely, an isolated low HDL-C in the presence of normal 
TGs  should  prompt  consideration  of  a  primary  genetic  etiology  (as 
above) or specific secondary factors (see below).

Very-Low-Fat Diet  Dietary fat is positively associated with HDL-C 
levels.  Individuals  who  eat  very-low-fat  vegan  diets  or  who  have 
anorexia or severe fat malabsorption often have low levels of HDL-C 
that are secondary to low dietary fat. In this setting, LDL-C levels are 
also usually low as well. There is no known harm to low HDL-C levels 
in this setting and no indication for liberalizing the diet solely for the 
purpose of raising the HDL-C.

Sedentary Lifestyle  and Obesity  Physical  activity  is  known  to 
have  a  (generally  modest)  effect  in  raising  HDL-C  levels,  and  con-
versely, a sedentary lifestyle is often associated with low HDL-C levels. 
Concordant with that observation, obesity is frequently associated with 
low  HDL-C  levels  even  when  overt  insulin  resistance  or  HTG  is  not 
present. Increased physical activity and weight loss usually have some 
effect in raising HDL-C, which is not the primary reason for recom-
mending  these  interventions  but  can  have  a  motivating  influence  on 
the patient.
ANABOLIC  STEROIDS  AND  TESTOSTERONE  Anabolic  steroids  have 
a  well-established  effect  on  lowering  HDL-C  levels,  sometimes  quite 
dramatically.  Testosterone  supplementation  can  also  reduce  HDL-C 
levels,  although  not  to  the  degree  caused  by  anabolic  steroids.  In  a 
young male patient who presents with unexplained very low HDL-C, 
a careful history of medication and supplement use should be taken.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Lipoprotein Disorders

The major goals in the diagnosis and clinical management of lipo-
protein disorders are (1) prevention of acute pancreatitis in patients 
with  severe  HTG  and  (2)  prevention  of  CVD  and  related  cardio-
vascular events. Given the high prevalence of dyslipidemia and the 
proven clinical benefits of early diagnosis and initiation of therapy, 
it  is  essential  that  physicians  screen  lipids  systematically,  rule  out 
secondary  causes  of  dyslipidemia,  suspect  inherited  disorders  of 
lipoprotein  metabolism  where  appropriate,  actively  promote  fam-
ily-based  cascade  screening,  carefully  assess  risk  for  ASCVD  and 
consider  additional  risk  stratification  approaches,  and  be  knowl-
edgeable  about  the  wide  range  of  existing  therapeutic  options  for 
dyslipidemia.  The  field  of  clinical  lipidology  has  matured  and  is 
moving  toward  a  more  systematic  clinical  application  of  genomic 
medicine.  Diagnostic  DNA  sequencing  or  genotyping  in  patients 
with  suspected  FCS,  FPLD,  FH,  and  FDBL  has  the  potential  to 
enhance  molecular  diagnosis,  facilitate  appropriate  therapeutic 
interventions, and promote family-based cascade screening. 

DIAGNOSIS
A critical first step in managing a lipoprotein disorder is to attempt 
to determine the class or classes of lipoproteins that are increased 
or  decreased  in  the  patient.  Once  the  dyslipidemia  is  accurately 
classified, efforts should be directed to identify or rule out any pos-
sible secondary causes (Table 407-3). A careful social, medical, and 
family history should be obtained. In patients with elevated TG lev-
els (>150 mg/dL), a fasting glucose and/or hemoglobin A1c should 
be obtained to rule out diabetes. In patients with elevated LDL-C 
levels (>160 mg/dL), a TSH should be obtained to rule out hypo-
thyroidism and consideration should be given to the possibility of 
liver  or  kidney  disease.  Once  secondary  causes  have  been  ruled 
out, attempts should be made to diagnose a primary lipid disorder, 
because the underlying genetic defect can provide important prog-
nostic information regarding the risk of pancreatitis in severe HTG 
and  the  risk  of  ASCVD  in  other  dyslipidemias,  as  well  as  impact 
on  the  choice  of  drug  therapy  and  the  screening  of  other  family 
members. Obtaining the correct diagnosis often requires a detailed 
family  history,  lipid  analyses  in  family  members,  and  sometimes 
specialized or genetic testing. 

Severe  Hypertriglyceridemia 
If  the  fasting  plasma  TG  level  is 
>500  mg/dL,  the  patient  has  severe  HTG  and  may  be  at  risk  for 
pancreatitis.  If  the  TG  levels  are  persistently  severely  elevated, 
especially if they are >1000 mg/dL, and the total cholesterol-to-TG 
ratio is >8, FCS should be considered, and genetic testing of an FCS 
gene panel may be indicated (Table 407-2). If central obesity, insulin 
resistance, and/or fatty liver disease are also present, consideration 
should be given to the possibility of FPLD, and an FPLD gene panel 
may  be  indicated  (Table  407-2).  However,  most  individuals  with 
severe HTG do not have a single-gene disorder but have increased 
polygenic  risk  for  high  TGs  often  exacerbated  by  secondary  fac-
tors  (diet,  alcohol,  obesity,  insulin  resistance,  medications).  Such 
patients are still at risk for acute pancreatitis and should be treated 
to  reduce  their  TG  levels  and  thus  their  risk  of  pancreatitis  (see 
below). 
Hypercholesterolemia 
If  the  LDL-C  levels  are  >190  mg/dL,  the 
patient has severe hypercholesterolemia and is at risk for premature 
ASCVD. In absence of secondary causes, FH should be considered, 
particularly  if  there  is  a  family  history  of  hypercholesterolemia 
and/or  premature  CHD,  and  genetic  testing  of  an  FH  gene  panel 
may  be  indicated  (Table  407-2).  While  FH  is  a  clinical  diagnosis, 
a  finding  of  a  causal  mutation  may  appropriately  result  in  earlier 
and  more  aggressive  therapy  to  lower  LDL-C  and  should  also 
promote  family-based  cascade  screening  as  per  the  Centers  for 
Disease Control and Prevention guidelines labeling FH as a Tier 1 
condition. Recessive forms of severe hypercholesterolemia are rare, 
but if a patient with severe hypercholesterolemia has parents with 
normal cholesterol levels, ARH, sitosterolemia, and LALD should 
be considered, and genetic testing may be indicated (Table 407-2). 
Patients  without  an  identified  genetic  variant  or  who  have  more 
moderate hypercholesterolemia are likely to have polygenic hyper-
cholesterolemia but should still be considered at risk and eligible for 
treatment (see below). 

Mixed Hyperlipidemia  Elevations in fasting plasma levels of both 
TGs (>150 mg/dL) and LDL-C (>130 mg/dL), often accompanied 
by reduced levels of HDL-C (<40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in 
women), are common, and such patients are often diagnosed as hav-
ing “mixed hyperlipidemia.” Most such patients are at increased risk 
of ASCVD and merit consideration of lifestyle and/or pharmaco-
logic interventions. Secondary factors, particularly obesity, insulin 
resistance, and type 2 diabetes, are common in such patients, who 
often also have increased polygenic risk for dyslipidemia. The pres-
ence of palmar or tuberous xanthomas or an unusual lipid profile 
of total cholesterol and TG levels in the same range with an HDL-C 
that is not reduced should prompt consideration of FDBL, or type 
III  hyperlipidemia,  and  can  be  diagnosed  by  a  nuclear  magnetic

resonance  (NMR)  lipoprotein  profile  or  genetic  testing  for  the 
APOE2  genotype.  FDBL  patients  should  be  managed  aggressively 
due  to  substantially  increased  risk  of  ASCVD.  More  commonly, 
patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, particularly those with family 
histories of dyslipidemia or premature ASCVD, have familial com-
bined hyperlipidemia (FCHL). ApoB should be measured in such 
patients,  and  the  finding  of  substantially  elevated  apoB  levels  can 
help identify patients with FCHL, who are at especially increased 
risk of ASCVD and require more aggressive treatment.

TREATMENT
Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

There  is  a  well-established  observational  relationship  between 
severe HTG, particularly chylomicronemia, and acute pancreatitis; 
however, there has never been a clinical trial designed or powered to 
definitively prove that intervention to reduce TGs reduces the risk 
of  pancreatitis.  Nevertheless,  it  is  generally  considered  appropriate 
medical practice to intervene in patients with TGs >500 mg/dL in 
order to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. It remains uncertain whether 
chylomicronemia  increases  risk  for  ASCVD  per  se.  Importantly, 
moderate  HTG  (TG  150–500  mg/dL)  is  associated  with  increased 
ASCVD risk; management of these patients is focused on reducing 
risk of ASCVD and on reducing LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB. 

LIFESTYLE AND MODIFIABLE FACTORS
In patients with severe HTG, lifestyle modification can be associated 
with a significant reduction in plasma TG level. Patients who drink 
alcohol  should  be  encouraged  to  decrease  or  preferably  eliminate 
their intake. Patients with severe HTG often benefit from a formal 
dietary consultation with a dietician intimately familiar with coun-
seling patients on the dietary management of high TGs. Dietary fat 
intake should be restricted to reduce the formation of chylomicrons 
in the intestine. The excessive intake of simple carbohydrates should 
be discouraged because insulin drives TG production in the liver. 
Aerobic exercise and even increase in regular physical activity can 
have a positive effect in reducing TG levels and should be strongly 
encouraged. For patients who are overweight, weight loss can help 
to  reduce  TG  levels.  In  extreme  cases,  bariatric  surgery  has  been 
shown to not only produce effective weight loss but also substan-
tially  reduce  plasma  TG  levels.  Many  patients  with  diabetes  have 
HTG, and better control of diabetes can result in lowering of TGs. 
Finally, certain medications can exacerbate HTG (Table 407-3). 

PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY
Despite  lifestyle  interventions,  many  patients  with  severe  HTG 
require pharmacologic therapy (Table 407-4). Patients who persist 
in having fasting TG >500 mg/dL despite active lifestyle manage-
ment  are  candidates  for  pharmacologic  therapy.  The  two  major 
classes of drugs used for management of these patients are fibrates 
and omega-3 fatty acids (fish oils). In addition, statins can reduce 
plasma TG levels and also reduce ASCVD risk and should be used 
in patients with severe HTG who are at increased risk of ASCVD. 
Fibrates  Fibric acid derivatives, or fibrates, are agonists of PPARα, 
a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. 
Fibrates stimulate LPL activity (enhancing TG hydrolysis), reduce 
apoC-III  synthesis  (enhancing  lipoprotein  remnant  clearance), 
promote  β-oxidation  of  fatty  acids,  and  may  reduce  VLDL  TG 
production.  Fibrates  reduce  TG  levels  by  ~30%  in  individuals 
with  severe  HTG  and  are  often  used  as  first-line  therapy.  They 
sometimes modestly raise LDL-C levels. Fibrates are generally well 
tolerated but can cause myopathy, especially when combined with 
statins, can raise creatinine, and are associated with an increase in 
gallstones. Fibrates can potentiate the effect of warfarin and certain 
oral hypoglycemic agents. 

Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oils)  Omega-3 fatty acids, or omega-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), commonly known as fish 
oils, are present in high concentration in fish and in flaxseed. The 
n-3  PUFAs  used  for  the  treatment  of  HTG  are  eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). n-3 PUFAs have been 
concentrated into capsules and in doses of 3–4 g/d are effective at 
lowering fasting TG levels by ~30%. Fish oils can cause an increase 
in plasma LDL-C levels in some patients. Icosapent ethyl is an EPA-
only product that has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events 
in patients with HTG. In general, fish oils are well tolerated, with 
the major side effect being dyspepsia. They appear to be safe, at least 
at doses up to 3–4 g, but can be associated with a prolongation in the 
bleeding time. Fish oils can be first-line therapy for the treatment of 
severe HTG or can be used in combination with fibrates. 
APOC3  Silencing  ApoC-III  inhibits  LPL  and  TRL  uptake,  and 
genetic  variants  in  the  APOC3  gene  reduce  TG  levels  and  risk  of 
ASCVD.  Volanesorsen  is  an  antisense  oligonucleotide  targeted 
to  the  APOC3  mRNA  in  the  liver;  it  significantly  reduces  plasma 
apoC-III and TG levels and is approved in Europe for patients with 
FCS.  It  has  been  associated  with  severe  thrombocytopenia.  Addi-
tional therapeutic approaches to APOC3 and other targets for TG 
lowering are in development.

Hypercholesterolemia (Elevated LDL-C  
with or without Elevated TG)

There  are  abundant  and  compelling  data  that  intervention  to 
reduce LDL-C substantially reduces the risk of ASCVD, including 
myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as total mortality. Thus, it 
is  imperative  that  patients  with  hypercholesterolemia  be  carefully 
assessed for cardiovascular risk and need for intervention. It is also 
worth  emphasizing  that  patients  with  or  at  high  risk  for  ASCVD 
who  have  plasma  LDL-C  levels  in  the  “normal”  or  average  range 
also benefit from intervention to reduce LDL-C levels. 
LIFESTYLE AND MODIFIABLE FACTORS
In  patients  with  elevated  LDL-C,  lifestyle  modifications  can  be 
effective but are often less effective than in HTG. Patients should 
receive  dietary  counseling  to  reduce  the  content  of  saturated  fats 
and trans fats in the diet. Obese patients should make an effort to 
lose weight. Regular aerobic exercise has relatively little impact on 
reducing plasma LDL-C levels, although it has cardiovascular ben-
efits independent of LDL-C lowering. Patients with hypothyroidism 
should  be  optimally  controlled.  Finally,  certain  medications  can 
elevate LDL-C levels (Table 407-3). 
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY
The  decision  to  use  LDL-lowering  drug  therapy  (Table  407-4)—
with  a  statin  being  first-line  therapy—depends  on  the  presence 
of ASCVD or, if absent, the level of LDL-C as well as the level of 
cardiovascular  risk.  In  patients  with  established  ASCVD,  drug 
therapy to reduce LDL-C is well supported by clinical trial data to 
reduce LDL-C as long as it remains >70 mg/dL, using combination 
drug therapy if necessary. In the absence of ASCVD, patients with 
FH must be treated to reduce the very high lifetime risk of ASCVD, 
and treatment should be initiated as early as possible, ideally during 
childhood. Otherwise, the decision to initiate LDL-lowering drug 
therapy is generally determined by the level of cardiovascular risk. 
For  patients  >40  years  old  without  clinical  CVD,  the  AHA/ACC 
risk calculator can be used to determine the 10-year absolute risk 
for CVD, and current guidelines suggest that a 10-year risk >7.5% 
merits consideration of statin therapy regardless of plasma LDL-C 
level. For younger patients, the assessment of lifetime risk of CVD 
may help inform the decision to start a statin, as well as a careful 
assessment of family history of ASCVD. In patients for whom the 
decision  to  start  a  statin  is  uncertain  due  to  borderline  ASCVD 
risk  and/or  borderline  LDL-C  levels,  additional  risk  stratification 
might be considered. Blood tests that predict ASCVD risk beyond

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismtraditional risk factors include apoB, Lp(a), and high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In patients who are of a sufficient age 
(men >40 years and women >50 years), a coronary artery calcium 
(CAC) score has been shown to provide independent information 
about risk of CAD. Elevated levels of one or more of these biomark-
ers  or  an  elevated  CAC  score  might  be  used  to  justify  initiation 
of  statin  therapy  in  primary  prevention  for  patients  who  are  in  a 
borderline zone with regard to treatment. Finally, given the strong 
polygenic  contribution  to  ASCVD,  there  is  increasing  interest  in 
the concept that a polygenic risk score for CAD might eventually 
be of clinical utility in lifetime risk assessment and decision-making 
regarding statin therapy in primary prevention. 
HMG-CoA  Reductase  Inhibitors  (Statins)  Statins  inhibit  HMG-
CoA  reductase,  a  key  enzyme  in  cholesterol  biosynthesis.  By 
inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver, statins lead to a counter-
regulatory increase in the expression of the LDL receptor and thus 
accelerated clearance of circulating LDL, resulting in a dose-dependent 
reduction  in  plasma  levels  of  LDL-C.  The  magnitude  of  LDL-C 
lowering  associated  with  statin  treatment  (~30–55%)  varies  by 
statin and among individuals, but once a patient is on a statin, the 
doubling of the statin dose produces a ~6% further reduction in the 
level of plasma LDL-C. An extensive body of randomized clinical 
trials has clearly established that statin therapy significantly reduces 
major cardiovascular events (and in some cases total mortality) in 
both primary and secondary prevention settings. The seven statins 
currently  available  differ  in  their  LDL-C–reducing  potency 
(Table 407-4). Current recommendations are to use high-intensity 
statin therapy in patients with ASCVD or deemed at high risk of 
ASCVD. Statins also reduce plasma TGs in a dose-dependent fash-
ion, which is roughly proportional to their LDL-C–lowering effects.
Statins,  taken  in  tablet  form  once  a  day,  are  remarkably  safe 
and  well  tolerated.  The  most  important  side  effect  associated 
with  statin  therapy  is  muscle  pain,  or  myalgia,  which  occurs  in 
3–5% of patients, some of whom are unable to tolerate any statin. 
Severe  myopathy  (associated  with  an  increase  in  plasma  creatine 
kinase [CK]) and even rhabdomyolysis can occur rarely with statin 
treatment.  The  risk  of  statin-associated  myalgia  or  myopathy  is 
increased  by  the  presence  of  older  age,  frailty,  renal  insufficiency, 
and coadministration of drugs that interfere with the metabolism 
of  statins,  such  as  erythromycin  and  related  antibiotics,  antifun-
gal  agents,  immunosuppressive  drugs,  and  fibric  acid  derivatives 
(particularly  gemfibrozil).  In  the  event  of  muscle  symptoms,  a 
plasma  CK  level  may  be  obtained  to  differentiate  myopathy  from 
myalgia. Serum CK levels need not be monitored on a routine basis 
in patients taking statins because an elevated CK in the absence of 
symptoms does not predict the development of myopathy and does 
not necessarily suggest the need for discontinuing the drug. Statins 
can result in elevation in liver transaminases (alanine aminotrans-
ferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), but it is usually 
mild and transient and generally does not require discontinuation. 
Finally, meta-analyses of large randomized controlled clinical trials 
with statins indicate a slight excess in incident type 2 diabetes, an 
observation as yet not fully understood. However, the cardiovascu-
lar  benefits  associated  with  statin  therapy  far  outweigh  the  slight 
increase in incident diabetes. Based on their safety and extensively 
documented benefit with regard to cardiovascular outcomes, statins 
are the clear drug class of choice for LDL-C reduction and are by far 
the most widely used class of lipid-lowering drugs. 
Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitor  Cholesterol within the lumen of 
the small intestine is derived from the diet (about one-third) and 
the bile (about two-thirds) and is actively absorbed by the entero-
cyte  through  a  process  that  involves  the  protein  NPC1L1.  Eze-
timibe (Table 407-4) is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that binds 
directly to and inhibits NPC1L1 and blocks the intestinal absorp-
tion  of  cholesterol.  Ezetimibe  (10  mg  taken  once  daily)  inhibits 
cholesterol  absorption  by  almost  60%,  resulting  in  a  reduction  in 
delivery of dietary sterols in the liver and a compensatory increase

in hepatic LDL receptor expression. The mean reduction in plasma 
LDL-C on ezetimibe (10 mg) is 18%, and the effect is additive when 
used in combination with a statin. Effects on TG and HDL-C levels 
are negligible. Ezetimibe added to a statin has been shown to sig-
nificantly reduce major cardiovascular events compared with statin 
alone. It is generally considered the second-line option for adding 
to a statin in order to achieve further LDL-C reduction. Ezetimibe 
is  very  safe  and  well-tolerated.  When  used  in  combination  with 
a  statin,  monitoring  of  liver  transaminases  is  recommended.  The 
only roles for ezetimibe in monotherapy are in patients who do not 
tolerate statins and in some patients with sitosterolemia. 
PCSK9 Inhibitors  Circulating PCSK9 targets the LDL receptor for 
lysosomal degradation, thus reducing its recycling and abundance 
at the surface of the hepatocyte. Genetic loss of function of PCSK9 
results in low levels of LDL-C and protection from CAD. Antibod-
ies  to  PCSK9  (Table  407-4)  sequester  it  and  functionally  increase 
the  number  of  LDL  receptors  available  to  remove  LDL  from  the 
blood. They are highly effective in lowering LDL-C, with an ~60% 
reduction  in  LDL-C.  They  also  reduce  plasma  levels  of  Lp(a) 
modestly. Both PCSK9 antibodies have been shown to significantly 
reduce cardiovascular events when added to a statin in patients with 
existing  CAD.  These  antibodies  are  administered  subcutaneously 
every 2 weeks. They are generally well tolerated, with the major side 
effect  being  injection  site  reactions.  They  are  generally  indicated 
as second-line (added to statin) or third-line (added to statin plus 
ezetimibe) therapy in patients with FH or ASCVD in whom LDL-C 
is  not  reduced  to  acceptable  levels  with  a  statin  (with  or  without 
ezetimibe)  alone.  An  alternative  approach  to  silencing  PCSK9, 
inclisiran, is a therapeutic siRNA molecule that targets the PCSK9 
mRNA in the liver. In contrast to the antibodies, it is administered 
subcutaneously every 6 months. It is effective in reducing LDL-C 
by ~60% and appears to be well tolerated and safe; a cardiovascular 
outcomes trial is ongoing. 
ATP  Citrate  Lyase  Inhibitor  Bempedoic  acid  is  a  first-in-class 
competitive  inhibitor  of  ATP  citrate  lyase  (ACL),  which  acts  on 
mitochondrial-derived  citrate  to  generate  production  of  acetyl-
CoA, which is subsequently used for cholesterol synthesis. Thus, it 
reduces cholesterol synthesis through a different mechanism than 
statins, ultimately upregulating the hepatic LDL receptor. In phase 
3  trials,  bempedoic  acid  180  mg  daily  reduced  LDL-C  by  ~18% 
when  added  to  a  statin  and  by  ~23%  as  monotherapy.  A  cardio-
vascular  outcomes  trial  is  ongoing.  Bempedoic  acid  is  a  prodrug 
that requires activation by very-long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1 
(ASCVL1),  which  is  not  expressed  in  skeletal  muscle,  potentially 
explaining  why  it  has  less  association  with  myalgias  than  statins; 
indeed, it has been shown to be relatively well tolerated in patients 
with statin intolerance. It is available in a fixed-dose combination 
with ezetimibe, which reduced LDL-C by ~36%, for patients who 
are statin intolerant. It can be used in combination with statins but 
should not be used with simvastatin in a dose >20 mg. Bempedoic 
acid is associated with increased uric acid levels and incidence of 
gout;  it  was  also  associated  with  increased  incidence  of  tendon 
rupture in phase 3 trials. Unlike statins, it was not associated with 
increased incidence of diabetes. 
Bile  Acid  Sequestrants  (Resins)  Bile  acid  sequestrants  (BAS) 
bind bile acids in the intestine and promote their excretion rather 
than reabsorption in the ileum. To maintain the bile acid pool size, 
the  liver  diverts  cholesterol  to  bile  acid  synthesis.  The  decreased 
hepatic  intracellular  cholesterol  content  results  in  upregulation  of 
the  LDL  receptor  and  enhanced  LDL  clearance  from  the  plasma. 
BAS, including cholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevelam (Table 
407-4),  primarily  reduce  plasma  LDL-C  levels  but  can  cause  an 
increase  in  plasma  TGs.  Therefore,  patients  with  HTG  generally 
should not be treated with bile acid–binding resins. Cholestyramine 
and colestipol are insoluble resins that must be suspended in liquids. 
Colesevelam is available as tablets but generally requires up to six to 
seven tablets per day for effective LDL-C lowering. BAS are effective

in  combination  with  statins  and  in  combination  with  ezetimibe. 
Side  effects  of  resins  are  limited  to  the  gastrointestinal  tract  and 
include bloating and constipation. Because BAS are not systemically 
absorbed, they are very safe and are the cholesterol-lowering drug 
of choice in children and in women who are pregnant, lactating, or 
actively trying to conceive. However, they are otherwise fourth- or 
fifth-line drugs for LDL-C reduction in other settings. 

Specialized Drugs for HoFH  Three “orphan” drugs are approved 
specifically for the management of HoFH, a rare condition caused 
by  biallelic  mutations  in  the  major  genes  causing  FH  in  which 
patients  respond  poorly  to  traditional  LDL-lowering  medications. 
Lomitapide  is  a  small-molecule  inhibitor  of  MTP  that  reduces 
LDL-C by ~50%, and mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide 
against  apoB  tgat  reduces  LDL-C  by  ~25%.  Both  of  these  drugs 
reduce hepatic VLDL production and thus LDL-C levels; however, 
due to their mechanism of action, each drug causes an increase in 
hepatic  fat,  the  long-term  consequences  of  which  are  unknown. 
In  addition,  lomitapide  is  associated  with  gastrointestinal-related 
side effects, and mipomersen is associated with skin reactions and 
flulike  symptoms.  Finally,  an  antibody  inhibitor  of  ANGPTL3, 
evinacumab, was approved in 2021 for the treatment of HoFH. In a 
phase 3 trial, an intravenous infusion every 4 weeks reduced LDL-C 
levels in patients with HoFH by ~50% and was well tolerated. One 
of these three drugs should be considered in HoFH patients after 
a trial of a high-intensity statin, and possibly a PCSK9 inhibitor, is 
shown to be insufficient to reduce LDL-C levels. 

LDL  Apheresis  Patients  with  severe  hypercholesterolemia  who 
cannot  reduce  their  LDL-C  to  acceptable  levels  despite  optimally 
tolerated combination drug therapy are candidates for LDL apher-
esis.  In  this  process,  the  patient’s  plasma  is  passed  over  a  column 
that selectively removes the LDL, and the LDL-depleted plasma is 
returned to the patient. LDL apheresis is indicated for patients on 
maximally tolerated combination drug therapy (including a PCSK9 
inhibitor) who have CHD and a plasma LDL-C level >200 mg/dL 
or no CHD and a plasma LDL-C level >300 mg/dL; LDL apheresis 
could be considered in high-risk patients who have an LDL-C >160 
mg/dL on maximal therapy.

408 The Metabolic Syndrome

Robert H. Eckel

The  metabolic  syndrome  (syndrome  X,  insulin  resistance  syndrome) 
consists  of  a  constellation  of  metabolic  abnormalities  that  confer 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus. 
Evolution of the criteria for the metabolic syndrome since the original 
definition by the World Health Organization in 1998 reflects growing 
clinical  evidence  and  analysis  by  a  variety  of  consensus  conferences 
and  professional  organizations.  The  major  features  of  the  metabolic 
syndrome  include  central  obesity,  hypertriglyceridemia,  low  levels  of 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hyperglycemia, and hyper-
tension (Table 408-1).

 ■ GLOBAL HEALTH/EPIDEMIOLOGY
The most challenging feature of the metabolic syndrome to define is 
waist  circumference.  Intraabdominal  circumference  (visceral  adipose 
tissue) is most strongly related to insulin resistance and risk of diabetes 
and CVD, and for any given waist circumference, the distribution of 
adipose  tissue  between  subcutaneous  (SC)  and  visceral  depots  varies 
substantially. Thus, within and between populations, there is a lesser 
versus greater risk at the same waist circumference. These differences 
in populations reflect the range of waist circumferences considered to 
confer risk in different geographic locations (Table 408-1).

The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome varies around the world, 
in part reflecting the age and ethnicity of the populations studied and 
the diagnostic criteria applied. In general, the prevalence of the met-
abolic syndrome increases with age. The prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome in the U.S. adult population meeting the criteria of the National 
Cholesterol  Education  Program  (NCEP)  and  Adult  Treatment  Panel 
III  (ATPIII)  is  ~35%.  Greater  global  industrialization  is  associated 
with rising rates of obesity and expected increase in the prevalence of 
the metabolic syndrome, especially as the population ages. Moreover, 
the  rising  prevalence  and  severity  of  obesity  among  children  reflect 
features  of  the  metabolic  syndrome  in  a  younger  population,  now 
estimated  to  be  12  and  30%  among  obese  and  overweight  children, 
respectively.

Using  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey 
(NHANES)  data  from  2012–2016,  the  prevalence  of  metabolic  syn-
drome  in  the  United  States  was  34.7%  and  not  different  between 
men  (35.1%)  and  women  (34.3%).  The  highest  prevalence  was  in 
“other” race/ethnicity (39.0%) followed by Hispanic (36.3%) and non- 
Hispanic white (36.0%). Although increased from 32.5% in 2010–2012, 
the increase was not significant; however, the prevalence did increase 
significantly among those aged 20–39 years (from 16.2 to 21.3%) and 
in  women  (from  31.7  to  36.6%),  Asian  participants  (from  19.9  to 
26.2%), and Hispanic participants (from 32.9 to 40.4%). As in previous 
data, prevalence of metabolic syndrome increased with increasing age 
among all subgroups, i.e., from 19.5% among those aged 20–39 years 
to 48.6% among those aged ≥60 years.

The frequency distribution of the five components of the syndrome 
for  the  U.S.  population  (NHANES  III)  is  summarized  in  Fig.  408-1. 
Increases in waist circumference predominate among women, whereas 
increases in fasting plasma triglyceride levels (i.e., >150 mg/dL), reduc-
tions in HDL cholesterol levels, and hyperglycemia are more likely in 
men.

 ■ RISK FACTORS
Overweight/Obesity  The metabolic syndrome was first described 
in  the  early  twentieth  century;  however,  the  worldwide  overweight/
obesity  epidemic  has  recently  been  the  force  driving  its  increasing 
recognition.  Central  adiposity  is  a  key  feature  of  the  syndrome,  and 
the  syndrome’s  prevalence  reflects  the  strong  relationship  between 
waist  circumference  and  increasing  adiposity.  However,  despite  the 
importance of obesity, patients who are of normal weight may also be

insulin-resistant and may have the metabolic syndrome. This pheno-
type  is  particularly  evident  for  populations  in  India,  Southeast  Asia, 
and Central America.

Sedentary Lifestyle  Physical inactivity and less cardiorespiratory 
fitness  are  predictors  of  CVD  events  and  the  related  risk  of  death. 
Many  components  of  the  metabolic  syndrome  are  associated  with  a 
sedentary lifestyle, including increased adipose tissue (predominantly 
central), reduced HDL cholesterol, and increased triglycerides, blood 
pressure,  and  glucose  in  genetically  susceptible  persons.  Compared 
with individuals who watch television or videos or use the computer 
<1 h daily, those who do so for >4 h daily have a twofold increased risk 
of the metabolic syndrome.

Genetics  No single gene explains the complex phenotype called the 
metabolic  syndrome.  However,  using  genome-wide  association  and 
candidate gene approaches, several genetic variants are associated with 
the  metabolic  syndrome.  Although  many  of  the  loci  have  unknown 
function,  many  others  relate  to  body  weight  and  composition,  insu-
lin  resistance,  and  unfavorable  disturbances  in  lipid  and  lipoprotein 
metabolism.

Aging  The  metabolic  syndrome  affects  nearly  50%  of  the  U.S. 
population aged >60, and at >60 years of age, women are more often 
affected. The age dependency of the syndrome’s prevalence is seen in 
most populations around the world.

Diabetes Mellitus  Diabetes mellitus can be included in both the 
NCEP  and  the  harmonizing  definitions  of  the  metabolic  syndrome, 
but the greatest value of the metabolic syndrome, and especially fasting 
glucose,  is  predicting  type  2  diabetes.  The  great  majority  (~75%)  of 
patients  with  type  2  diabetes  or  impaired  glucose  tolerance  have  the 
metabolic syndrome. The presence of the metabolic syndrome in these 
populations relates to a higher prevalence of CVD than in patients who 
have type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance but do not have the 
syndrome.

Cardiovascular  Disease 
Individuals  with  the  metabolic  syn-
drome are twice as likely to die of CVD as those who do not, and their 
risk of an acute myocardial infarction or stroke is threefold higher. The 
approximate  prevalence  of  the  metabolic  syndrome  among  patients 
with coronary heart disease (CHD) is 60%, with a prevalence of ~35% 
among patients with premature coronary artery disease (age ≤45) and a 
particularly high prevalence among women. With appropriate cardiac 
rehabilitation and changes in lifestyle (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, 
weight  reduction,  and—in  some  cases—pharmacologic  therapy),  the 
prevalence of the syndrome can be reduced.

Lipodystrophy  Lipodystrophic  disorders  in  general  are  associ-
ated with the metabolic syndrome. Moreover, it is quite common for 
such  patients  to  present  with  the  metabolic  syndrome.  Both  genetic 

lipodystrophy  (e.g.,  Berardinelli-Seip  congenital  lipodystrophy,  Dun-
nigan  familial  partial  lipodystrophy)  and  acquired  lipodystrophy 
(e.g., HIV-related lipodystrophy and in HIV patients receiving certain 
antiretroviral therapies) may give rise to severe insulin resistance and 
many of the components of the metabolic syndrome.

 ■ ETIOLOGY
Insulin  Resistance  The  most  accepted  and  unifying  hypothesis 
to describe the pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome is insulin 
resistance, caused systemically by an incompletely understood defect in 
insulin action (Chap. 403). The onset of insulin resistance is heralded 
by postprandial hyperinsulinemia, which is followed by fasting hyper-
insulinemia and ultimately by hyperglycemia.

An early major contributor to the development of insulin resistance 
is  an  overabundance  of  circulating  fatty  acids  (Fig.  408-2).  Plasma 
albumin-bound  free  fatty  acids  are  derived  predominantly  from 
adipose-tissue  triglyceride  stores  released  by  intracellular  lipolytic 
enzymes.  The  lipolysis  of  triglyceride-rich  lipoproteins  in  tissues  by 
lipoprotein lipase also produces free fatty acids. Insulin mediates both 
anti-lipolysis and the stimulation of lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue. 
Of note, the inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue is the most sensi-
tive pathway of insulin action. Thus, when insulin resistance develops, 
increased lipolysis produces more fatty acids, which further decrease 
the  anti-lipolytic  effect  of  insulin.  Excessive  fatty  acids  enhance  sub-
strate  availability  and  create  insulin  resistance  by  modifying  down-
stream  signaling.  Fatty  acids  impair  insulin-mediated  glucose  uptake 
and  accumulate  as  triglycerides  in  both  skeletal  and  cardiac  muscle, 
whereas  increased  fatty  acid  flux  increases  glucose  production  and 
triglyceride production and accumulation in the liver.

Leptin  resistance  also  may  be  a  pathophysiologic  mechanism 
to  explain  the  metabolic  syndrome.  Physiologically,  leptin  reduces 
appetite,  promotes  energy  expenditure,  and  enhances  insulin  sensi-
tivity  when  insulin  resistance  is  associated  with  leptin  deficiency.  In 
addition,  leptin  may  regulate  cardiac  and  vascular  function  through 
a  nitric  oxide–dependent  mechanism.  However,  when  obesity  devel-
ops, hyperleptinemia ensues, with evidence of leptin resistance in the 
brain  and  other  tissues  resulting  in  inflammation,  insulin  resistance, 
hyperlipidemia,  and  a  plethora  of  cardiovascular  disorders,  such  as 
hypertension, atherosclerosis, CHD, and heart failure.

The  oxidative  stress  hypothesis  provides  a  unifying  theory  for 
aging and the predisposition to the metabolic syndrome. In studies of  
insulin-resistant  individuals  with  obesity  or  type  2  diabetes,  the  off-
spring  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes,  and  the  elderly,  a  defect  in 
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation leads to the accumulation of 
triglycerides and related lipid molecules in muscle, liver, and perhaps 
other tissues, i.e., β-cells.

Recently, the gut microbiome has emerged as an important contrib-
utor  to  the  development  of  obesity  and  related  metabolic  disorders,

FIGURE 408-2  Pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome. Free fatty acids (FFAs) are released in abundance from an expanded adipose tissue mass. In the liver, FFAs 
result  in  increased  production  of  glucose  and  triglycerides  and  secretion  of  very-low-density  lipoproteins  (VLDLs).  Associated  lipid/lipoprotein  abnormalities  include 
reductions in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and an increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number. FFAs also reduce insulin sensitivity in muscle by 
inhibiting insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Associated defects include a reduction in glucose partitioning to glycogen and increased lipid accumulation in triglyceride 
(TG). The increase in circulating glucose, and to some extent FFAs, increases pancreatic insulin secretion, resulting in hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia may result in 
enhanced sodium reabsorption and increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and contribute to hypertension, as might higher levels of circulating FFAs. The 
proinflammatory state is superimposed and contributory to the insulin resistance produced by excessive FFAs. The enhanced secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor 
necrosis factor α (TNF-α) produced by adipocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages results in more insulin resistance and lipolysis of adipose tissue triglyceride stores 
to circulating FFAs. IL-6 and other cytokines also enhance hepatic glucose production, VLDL production by the liver, hypertension, and insulin resistance in muscle. Insulin 
resistance also contributes to increased triglyceride accumulation in the liver (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). Cytokines and FFAs also increase hepatic production of 
fibrinogen and adipocyte production of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), resulting in a pro-thrombotic state. Higher levels of circulating cytokines stimulate hepatic 
production of C-reactive protein (CRP). Reduced production of the anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing cytokine adiponectin is also associated with the metabolic 
syndrome. (Reproduced with permission from RH Eckel et al: The metabolic syndrome. Lancet 365:1415, 2005.)

including inflammation and components of the metabolic syndrome. 
Although  the  mechanisms  remain  uncertain,  interaction  among 
genetic  predisposition,  diet,  bile  acid  metabolism,  and  the  intestinal 
flora is important.

Increased  Waist  Circumference  Waist  circumference  is  an 
important component of the most recent and frequently applied diag-
nostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome. However, measuring waist 
circumference does not reliably distinguish increases in SC abdominal 
adipose tissue from that in visceral fat; this distinction requires CT or 
MRI. With increases in visceral adipose tissue, adipose tissue–derived 
free  fatty  acids  reach  the  liver  more  readily.  In  contrast,  increases  in 
abdominal  SC  fat  release  lipolysis  products  into  the  systemic  circu-
lation and therefore have fewer direct effects on hepatic metabolism. 
Relative  increases  in  visceral  versus  SC  adipose  tissue  with  increas-
ing  waist  circumference  in  Asians  and  Asian  Indians  may  explain 
the  greater  prevalence  of  the  syndrome  in  those  populations  than  in  
African-American men, in whom SC fat predominates. It is also pos-
sible  that  visceral  fat  is  a  marker  for—but  not  the  source  of—excess 
postprandial free fatty acids in obesity.

Dyslipidemia 
(See also Chap. 407) In general, free fatty acid flux 
to the liver results in increased production of apolipoprotein (apo) B–
containing,  triglyceride-rich,  very-low-density  lipoproteins  (VLDLs). 
The  effect  of  insulin  on  this  process  is  complex,  but  hypertriglyceri-
demia  is  an  excellent  marker  of  the  insulin-resistant  condition.  Not 
only is hypertriglyceridemia a feature of the metabolic syndrome, but 
patients with the metabolic syndrome have elevated levels of apoC-III 
carried on VLDLs and other lipoproteins. This increase in apoC-III is 
inhibitory  to  lipoprotein  lipase,  reduces  triglyceride-rich  lipoprotein 

remnant  removal  further  contributing  to  hypertriglyceridemia,  and 
confers more risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
The other major lipoprotein disturbance in the metabolic syndrome 
is  a  reduction  in  HDL  cholesterol.  This  reduction  is  a  consequence 
of  changes  in  HDL  composition  and  metabolism.  In  the  presence  of 
hypertriglyceridemia, a decrease in the cholesterol content of HDL is 
a consequence of reduced cholesteryl ester content of the lipoprotein 
core in combination with cholesteryl ester transfer protein–mediated 
alterations  in  triglycerides  that  make  the  HDL  particle  small  and 
dense. This change in lipoprotein composition also results in increased 
clearance of HDL from the circulation. These changes in HDL have a 
relationship to insulin resistance that is probably indirect, occurring in 
concert with the changes in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism.
In addition to HDLs, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) have altera-
tions in composition in the metabolic syndrome. With fasting serum 
triglycerides  at  >2.0  mM  (~180  mg/dL),  there  is  usually  a  predomi-
nance of small dense LDLs, which are thought to be more atherogenic, 
although  their  association  with  hypertriglyceridemia  and  low  HDLs 
make  their  independent  contribution  to  ASCVD  difficult  to  assess. 
Individuals with hypertriglyceridemia often have increases in choles-
terol content of both VLDL1 and VLDL2 subfractions and in LDL par-
ticle number. Both lipoprotein changes may contribute to atherogenic 
risk in patients with the metabolic syndrome.

Glucose  Intolerance 
(See  also  Chap.  403)  Defects  in  insulin 
action  in  the  metabolic  syndrome  lead  to  impaired  suppression  of 
glucose  production  by  the  liver  (and  kidney)  and  reduced  glucose 
uptake  and  metabolism  in  insulin-sensitive  tissues—i.e.,  muscle  and 
adipose tissue. There is a strong relationship between impaired fasting

3154 glucose or impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in stud-
ies  of  humans,  nonhuman  primates,  and  rodents.  To  compensate  for 
defects in insulin action, insulin secretion and/or clearance increases 
or decreases, respectively, so that euglycemia remains. Ultimately, this 
compensatory mechanism fails because of defects in insulin secretion, 
resulting in progression from impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired 
glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension  The  relationship  between  insulin  resistance  and 
hypertension  is  well  established.  Paradoxically,  under  normal  phys-
iologic  conditions,  insulin  is  a  vasodilator  with  secondary  effects  on 
sodium reabsorption in the kidney. However, in the setting of insulin 
resistance, the vasodilatory effect of insulin is lost but the renal effect 
on sodium reabsorption is preserved. Sodium reabsorption is increased 
in  Caucasians  with  the  metabolic  syndrome  but  not  in  Africans  or 
Asians. Insulin also increases the activity of the sympathetic nervous 
system, an effect that is preserved in the setting of insulin resistance. 
Insulin resistance is also associated with pathway-specific impairment 
in  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase  signaling.  In  the  endothelium,  this 
impairment may cause an imbalance between the production of nitric 
oxide and the secretion of endothelin 1, with a consequent decrease in 
blood flow. In addition, increases in angiotensinogen gene expression 
in  adipose  tissue  of  obese  subjects  results  in  increases  in  circulating 
angiotensin  II  and  vasoconstriction.  Although  these  mechanisms  are 
provocative,  the  inadequate  evaluation  of  insulin  action  by  measure-
ment  of  fasting  insulin  levels  or  by  homeostasis  model  assessment 
shows that insulin resistance contributes only partially to the increased 
prevalence of hypertension in the metabolic syndrome.

Another possible mechanism underlying hypertension in the met-
abolic syndrome is the vasoactive role of perivascular adipose tissue. 
Reactive  oxygen  species  released  by  NADPH  oxidase  impair  endo-
thelial  function  and  result  in  local  vasoconstriction.  Other  paracrine 
effects  such  as  leptin  or  other  proinflammatory  cytokines  released 
from adipose tissue, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) may also 
be important.

Hyperuricemia is another consequence of insulin resistance in the 
metabolic syndrome. There is growing evidence not only that uric acid 
is  associated  with  hypertension  but  also  that  reduction  of  uric  acid 
normalizes  blood  pressure  in  hyperuricemic  adolescents  with  hyper-
tension.  The  mechanism  appears  to  be  in  part  related  to  an  adverse 
effect of uric acid on nitric oxide synthase in the macula densa of the 
kidney and stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

Proinflammatory Cytokines  The increases in proinflammatory 
cytokines—including  interleukins  1,  6,  and  18;  resistin;  TNF-α;  and 
the systemic biomarker C-reactive protein—reflect overproduction by 
the expanded adipose tissue mass (Fig. 408-2). Adipose tissue–derived 
macrophages may be the primary source of proinflammatory cytokines 
locally  and  in  the  systemic  circulation.  It  remains  unclear,  however, 
how much of the insulin resistance is caused by the paracrine effects of 
these cytokines and how much by the endocrine effects.

Adiponectin  Adiponectin  is  an  anti-inflammatory  cytokine  pro-
duced exclusively by adipocytes. Adiponectin enhances insulin sensi-
tivity and inhibits many steps in the inflammatory process. In the liver, 
adiponectin inhibits the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes and the 
rate  of  glucose  production.  In  muscle,  adiponectin  increases  glucose 
transport and enhances fatty acid oxidation, partially through the acti-
vation of AMP kinase. Reductions in adiponectin levels are common 
in the metabolic syndrome. The relative contributions of adiponectin 
deficiency  and  overabundance  of  the  proinflammatory  cytokines  are 
unclear.
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Symptoms  and  Signs  The  metabolic  syndrome  typically  is  not 
associated with symptoms. On physical examination, waist circumfer-
ence and blood pressure are often elevated. The presence of either or 
both signs should prompt the clinician to search for other biochemical 
abnormalities  that  may  be  associated  with  the  metabolic  syndrome. 
Much  less  frequently,  lipoatrophy  or  acanthosis  nigricans  is  present 

on examination. Because these physical findings characteristically are 
associated with severe insulin resistance, other components of the met-
abolic syndrome are much more common.
Associated  Diseases 
•	 CARDIOVASCULAR  DISEASE  The  rela-
tive risk for new-onset CVD in patients with the metabolic syndrome 
who do not have diabetes averages 1.5- to 3-fold. However, in INTER-
HEART, a study of 26,903 subjects from 52 countries, the risk for acute 
myocardial infarction in subjects with the metabolic syndrome (World 
Health Organization or International Diabetes Federation definition) 
is comparable to that conferred by some, but not all, of the component 
risk factors. Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 2.72) and hypertension 
(OR,  2.60)  are  stronger  than  other  risk  factors.  Although  congestive 
heart failure and the metabolic syndrome can occur together, typically 
this consequence is secondary to metabolic syndrome–related ASCVD 
or hypertension. Metabolic syndrome is also associated with increases 
in  the  risk  for  stroke,  peripheral  vascular  disease,  and  Alzheimer’s 
disease.  However,  as  for  myocardial  infarction,  the  risk  beyond  the 
additive  role  of  the  components  of  the  metabolic  syndrome  remains 
debatable.  In  the  Reasons  for  Geographic  and  Racial  Differences  in 
Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, an observational study of black and white 
adults ≥45 years old across the United States, there were 9741 partici-
pants, and 41% had the metabolic syndrome. After adjustment for mul-
tiple confounders, metabolic syndrome was associated with increases 
in  high-sensitivity  C-reactive  protein  (hsCRP),  and  this  relationship 
was associated with a 1.34 relative risk for all-cause mortality, but <50% 
of deaths were from CVD. The population-attributable risk was 9.5% 
for the metabolic syndrome alone and 14.7% for both metabolic syn-
drome and increased hsCRP. The relationship of metabolic syndrome 
and hsCRP to mortality was greater for whites than blacks.
TYPE 2 DIABETES  Overall, the risk for type 2 diabetes among patients 
with  the  metabolic  syndrome  is  increased  three-  to  fivefold.  In  the 
Framingham  Offspring  Study’s  8-year  follow-up  of  middle-aged  par-
ticipants,  the  population-attributable  risk  of  the  metabolic  syndrome 
for developing type 2 diabetes was 62% among men and 47% among 
women, yet increases in fasting plasma glucose explained most, if not 
all, of this increased risk.
Other  Associated  Conditions 
In  addition  to  the  features  spe-
cifically  used  to  define  the  metabolic  syndrome,  other  metabolic 
alterations  are  secondary  to  or  accompany  insulin  resistance.  Those 
alterations  include  increases  in  apoB  and  apoC-III,  uric  acid,  proth-
rombotic  factors  (fibrinogen,  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor  1), 
serum  viscosity,  asymmetric  dimethylarginine,  homocysteine,  white 
blood cell count, proinflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein, urine 
albumin/creatinine  ratio,  nonalcoholic  fatty  liver  disease  (NAFLD) 
and/or  nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis  (NASH),  polycystic  ovary  syn-
drome, and obstructive sleep apnea.
NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE  NAFLD has become the most 
common liver disease, in part a consequence of the insulin resistance 
of  the  metabolic  syndrome.  The  mechanism  relates  to  increases  in 
free fatty acid flux and reductions in intrahepatic fatty acid oxidation 
with resultant increases in triglyceride biosynthesis and hepatocellular 
accumulation,  with  variable  inflammation  and  oxidative  stress.  The 
more serious NASH, a consequence of NAFLD in some patients and 
a  precursor  of  cirrhosis  and  end-stage  liver  disease,  includes  a  more 
substantial  proinflammatory  contribution.  NAFLD  affects  ~25%  of 
the  global  population  and  up  to  45%  of  patients  with  the  metabolic 
syndrome; over half of these patients have NASH. As the prevalence of 
overweight/obesity and the metabolic syndrome increases, NASH may 
become one of the more common causes of end-stage liver disease and 
hepatocellular carcinoma.
HYPERURICEMIA  (See also Chap. 417) Hyperuricemia reflects defects 
in insulin action on the renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid and may 
contribute to hypertension through its effect on the endothelium. An 
increase  in  asymmetric  dimethylarginine,  an  endogenous  inhibitor 
of  nitric  oxide  synthase,  also  relates  to  endothelial  dysfunction.  In 
addition, increases in the urine albumin/creatinine ratio may relate to 
altered endothelial pathophysiology in the insulin-resistant state.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismPOLYCYSTIC  OVARY  SYNDROME  (See  also  Chap.  392)  Polycystic 
ovary syndrome is highly associated with insulin resistance (50–80%) 
and  the  metabolic  syndrome,  with  a  prevalence  of  the  syndrome 
between 12 and 60% based on phenotypes D through A.
OBSTRUCTIVE  SLEEP  APNEA  (See  also  Chap.  31)  Obstructive  sleep 
apnea  is  commonly  associated  with  obesity,  hypertension,  increased 
circulating  cytokines,  impaired  glucose  tolerance,  and  insulin  resis-
tance. In fact, obstructive sleep apnea may predict metabolic syndrome, 
even in the absence of excess adiposity. Moreover, when biomarkers of 
insulin  resistance  are  compared  between  patients  with  obstructive 
sleep apnea and weight-matched controls, insulin resistance is found to 
be more severe in those with apnea. Continuous positive airway pres-
sure treatment improves insulin sensitivity in patients with obstructive 
sleep apnea.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The  diagnosis  of  the  metabolic  syndrome  relies  on  fulfillment  of  the 
criteria listed in Table 408-1, as assessed using tools at the bedside and in 
the laboratory. The medical history should include evaluation of symp-
toms  for  obstructive  sleep  apnea  in  all  patients  and  polycystic  ovary 
syndrome in premenopausal women. Family history will help determine 
risk for CVD and diabetes mellitus. Blood pressure and waist circum-
ference measurements provide information necessary for the diagnosis.

Laboratory  Tests  Measurement  of  fasting  lipids  and  glucose  is 
needed  in  determining  whether  the  metabolic  syndrome  is  present. 
The  measurement  of  additional  biomarkers  associated  with  insulin 
resistance  can  be  individualized.  Such  tests  might  include  those  for 
apoB,  hsCRP,  fibrinogen,  uric  acid,  urinary  albumin/creatinine  ratio, 
and  liver  function.  A  sleep  study  should  be  performed  if  symptoms 
of  obstructive  sleep  apnea  are  present.  If  polycystic  ovary  syndrome 
is  suspected  based  on  clinical  features  and  anovulation,  testosterone, 
luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone should be mea-
sured.  NAFLD  can  be  further  assessed  by  the  NAFLD  fibrosis  score 
(FIB4) or elastography.

TREATMENT
The Metabolic Syndrome 

LIFESTYLE (SEE ALSO CHAP. 402)
Obesity,  particularly  abdominal,  is  the  driving  force  behind  the 
metabolic  syndrome.  Thus,  weight  reduction  is  the  primary 
approach  to  the  disorder.  With  at  least  a  5%  and  more  so  with 
10%  weight  reduction,  improvement  in  insulin  sensitivity  results 
in  favorable  modifications  in  many  components  of  the  metabolic 
syndrome. In general, recommendations for weight loss include a 
combination of caloric restriction, increased physical activity, and 
behavior  modification.  Caloric  restriction  is  the  most  important 
component,  whereas  increases  in  physical  activity  are  important 
for maintenance of weight loss. Some but not all evidence suggests 
that  the  addition  of  exercise  to  caloric  restriction  may  promote 
greater weight loss from the visceral depot. The tendency for weight 
regain  after  successful  weight  reduction  underscores  the  need  for 
long-lasting behavioral changes. 
Diet  Before  prescribing  a  weight-loss  diet,  it  is  important  to 
emphasize that it has taken the patient a long time to develop an 
expanded  fat  mass;  thus,  the  correction  need  not  occur  quickly. 
Given that ~3500 kcal = 1 lb of fat, an ~500-kcal restriction daily 
equates to weight reduction of 1 lb per week. Diets restricted in car-
bohydrate typically provide a more rapid initial weight loss. How-
ever, after 1 year, the amount of weight reduction is minimally more 
reduced  or  no  different  from  that  with  caloric  restriction  alone. 
Thus, adherence to the diet is more important than the chosen diet. 
Moreover, there is concern about low-carbohydrate diets enriched 
in saturated fat, particularly for patients at risk for ASCVD. There-
fore, a high-quality dietary pattern—i.e., a diet enriched in fruits, 
vegetables, whole grains, lean poultry, and fish—should be encour-
aged to maximize overall health benefit.

Physical Activity  Before  prescribing  a  physical  activity  program 
to patients with the metabolic syndrome, it is important to ensure 
that  the  increased  activity  does  not  incur  risk.  Some  high-risk 
patients  should  undergo  formal  cardiovascular  evaluation  before 
initiating an exercise program. For an inactive participant, gradual 
increases  in  physical  activity  should  be  encouraged  to  enhance 
adherence and avoid injury. Although increases in physical activity 
can  lead  to  modest  weight  reduction,  60–90  min  of  moderate-  to 
high-intensity  daily  activity  is  required  to  achieve  this  goal.  Even 
if an overweight or obese adult is unable to undertake this level of 
activity, a health benefit will follow from at least 30 min of moder-
ate-intensity activity daily. The caloric value of 30 min of a variety of 
activities can be found at https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-
weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-of-leisure-and-routine-
activities. Of note, a variety of routine activities, such as gardening, 
walking, and housecleaning, require moderate caloric expenditure. 
Thus, physical activity should not be defined solely in terms of for-
mal exercise such as jogging, swimming, or tennis. 
Behavior  Modification  Behavioral  treatment  typically  includes 
recommendations for dietary restriction and more physical activ-
ity  that  predicts  sufficient  weight  loss  that  benefits  metabolic 
health.  The  subsequent  challenge  is  the  duration  of  the  program 
because weight regain so often follows successful weight reduction. 
Improved  long-term  outcomes  often  follow  a  variety  of  methods, 
such as a personal or group counselor, the Internet, social media, 
and  telephone  follow-up  to  maintain  contact  between  providers 
and patients. 
Obesity 
(See  also  Chap.  402)  In  some  patients  with  the  meta-
bolic syndrome, treatment options need to extend beyond lifestyle 
intervention. Weight-loss drugs come in two major classes: appetite 
suppressants  and  absorption  inhibitors.  Appetite  suppressants 
approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA) 
include phentermine (for short-term use [3 months] only) as well 
as the more recent additions phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/ 
bupropion, high-dose (3.0 mg) liraglutide (rather than 1.8 mg, the 
maximum for treatment of type 2 diabetes), semaglutide (2.4 mg) 
which are approved without restrictions on the duration of therapy. 
In  clinical  trials,  the  phentermine/topiramate  extended-release 
combination resulted in ~8% weight loss relative to placebo in 50% 
of  patients.  Side  effects  include  palpitations,  headache,  paresthe-
sias,  constipation,  and  insomnia.  Naltrexone/bupropion  extended 
release reduces body weight by ≥10% in ~20% of patients; however, 
the  drug  combination  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  seizure 
disorders or any condition that predisposes to seizures. Naltrexone/
bupropion also increases pulse and blood pressure and should not 
be  given  to  patients  with  uncontrolled  hypertension.  High-dose 
liraglutide,  a  glucagon-like  peptide  1  (GLP-1)  receptor  agonist, 
results in ~6% weight loss relative to placebo with ~33% of patients 
with  >10%  weight  loss.  Common  side  effects  are  limited  to  the 
upper gastrointestinal tract, including nausea and, less frequently, 
emesis.  Semaglutide  (2.4  mg  weekly),  recently  FDA  approved 
has  been  shown  to  produce  an  average  weight  loss  of  14.9%  over 
68 weeks.

Orlistat inhibits fat absorption by ~30% and is moderately effec-
tive  compared  with  placebo  (~4%  more  weight  loss).  Moreover, 
orlistat reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes, an effect that was 
especially evident among patients with impaired glucose tolerance 
at baseline. This drug is often difficult to take because of oily leak-
age per rectum. In general, for all weight-loss drugs, greater weight 
reduction  leads  to  greater  improvement  in  metabolic  syndrome 
components, including the conversion from prediabetes to type 2 
diabetes.

Metabolic or bariatric surgery is an important option for patients 
with  the  metabolic  syndrome  who  have  a  body  mass  index  of   
>40  kg/m2  or  >35  kg/m2  with  comorbidities.  An  evolving  appli-
cation  for  metabolic  surgery  includes  patients  with  a  body  mass 
index  as  low  as  30  kg/m2  and  type  2  diabetes.  Gastric  bypass  or 
vertical  sleeve  gastrectomy  results  in  dramatic  weight  reduction

and  improvement  in  most  features  of  the  metabolic  syndrome.  A 
survival benefit with gastric bypass has also been realized. 

LDL CHOLESTEROL (SEE ALSO CHAP. 407)
The rationale for the development of criteria for the metabolic syn-
drome  by  NCEP  was  to  go  beyond  LDL  cholesterol  in  identifying 
and reducing the risk of ASCVD. The working assumption by the 
panel  was  that  LDL  cholesterol  goals  had  already  been  achieved 
and that increasing evidence supports a linear reduction in ASCVD 
events  because  of  progressive  lowering  of  LDL  cholesterol  with 
statins  with  subsequent  benefit  using  additional  LDL  cholesterol–
lowering agents. The 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/
American  Health  Association  (AHA)  Cholesterol  Guidelines  have 
no  specific  recommendations  for  patients  with  the  metabolic  syn-
drome;  however,  they  recommend  that  patients  aged  20–75  years 
with LDL cholesterol levels ≥190 mg/dL should use a high-intensity  
statin (e.g., atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily) 
and  those  with  type  2  diabetes  aged  40–75  years  should  use  a 
moderate-intensity  statin  and,  if  or  when  risk  estimate  is  high,  a 
high-intensity  statin.  For  patients  with  the  metabolic  syndrome 
but  without  diabetes,  the  10-year  ASCVD  risk  estimator  should 
be employed, and patients with a risk ≥7.5% and ≤20% or patients 
aged  20–59  with  elevated  lifetime  risk  should  have  a  discussion 
with their provider about initiating statin therapy for primary pre-
vention of ASCVD. A coronary calcium score may help in making 
this decision.

Diets  restricted  in  saturated  fats  (<6%  of  calories)  and  trans 
fats  (as  few  as  possible)  should  be  applied  aggressively.  Although 
evidence is controversial, dietary cholesterol can also be restricted. 
If  LDL  cholesterol  remains  elevated,  pharmacologic  intervention 
is  needed.  Based  on  substantial  evidence,  treatment  with  statins, 
which  lower  LDL  cholesterol  by  15–60%,  is  the  first-choice  med-
ication intervention. Of note, for each doubling of the statin dose, 
LDL  cholesterol  is  further  lowered  by  only  ~6%.  Hepatotoxicity 
(more  than  a  threefold  increase  in  hepatic  aminotransferases)  is 
rare, but myopathy occurs in ~10–20% of patients. The cholesterol 
absorption inhibitor ezetimibe is well tolerated and should be the 
second-choice medication intervention. Ezetimibe typically reduces 
LDL cholesterol by 15–20%. Bempedoic acid alone or in combina-
tion with ezetimibe is another option, with up to a 35% lowering 
of  LDL  cholesterol  with  the  combination.  Bempedoic  acid  can 
increase  plasma  uric  acid.  Proprotein  convertase  subtilisin/kexin 
type  9  (PCSK9)  inhibitors  are  potent  LDL  cholesterol–lowering 
drugs  (~45–60%)  but  are  not  needed  for  most  patients  with  the 
metabolic syndrome. Of course, if these patients also have familial 
hypercholesterolemia  or  insufficient  LDL  cholesterol  lowering  on 
statins  with  or  without  ezetimibe,  a  PCSK9  inhibitor  should  be 
considered.  The  bile  acid  sequestrants  cholestyramine,  colestipol, 
and  colesevelam  may  be  more  effective  than  ezetimibe  alone,  but 
because  they  can  increase  triglyceride  levels,  they  must  be  used 
with caution in patients with the metabolic syndrome when fasting 
triglycerides  are  >300  mg/dL.  Side  effects  include  gastrointestinal 
symptoms  (palatability,  bloating,  belching,  constipation,  anal  irri-
tation). Nicotinic acid has similar LDL cholesterol–lowering capa-
bilities (<20%). Fibrates are best employed to lower LDL cholesterol 
when triglycerides are not elevated. Fenofibrate may be more effec-
tive than gemfibrozil in this setting. 

TRIGLYCERIDES (SEE ALSO CHAP. 407)
The  2019  ACC/AHA  Cholesterol  Guidelines  stated  that  fasting 
triglycerides >500 mg/dL should be treated to prevent more serious 
hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis. Although a fasting triglycer-
ide value of >150 mg/dL is a component of the metabolic syndrome, 
post  hoc  analyses  of  multiple  fibrate  trials  have  suggested  reduc-
tion in the primary ASCVD outcome in patients (with or without 
concomitant statin therapy) with fasting triglycerides >200 mg/dL, 
often in the setting of reduced levels of HDL cholesterol. It remains 
uncertain whether triglycerides cause ASCVD or if levels are just 
associated with increased ASCVD risk.

A  fibrate  (gemfibrozil  or  fenofibrate)  is  one  drug  class  of  choice 
to  lower  fasting  triglyceride  levels,  which  are  typically  reduced  by 
30–45%. Concomitant administration with drugs metabolized by the 
3A4  cytochrome  P450  system  (including  some  statins)  increases  the 
risk of myopathy. In these cases, fenofibrate may be preferable to gemfi-
brozil. In the Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial, gemfibrozil was 
administered to men with known CHD and levels of HDL cholesterol 
<40 mg/dL. A coronary disease event and mortality rate benefit was 
experienced predominantly among men with hyperinsulinemia and/
or diabetes, many of whom were identified retrospectively as having 
the metabolic syndrome. Of note, the degree of triglyceride lowering in 
this trial or other fibrate trials did not predict benefit.

Other drugs that lower triglyceride levels include statins, nico-
tinic acid, and prescription omega-3 fatty acids. For this purpose, 
an  intermediate  or  high  dose  of  the  “more  potent”  statins  (ator-
vastatin,  rosuvastatin)  is  needed.  The  effect  of  nicotinic  acid  on 
fasting triglycerides is dose related and ~20–35%, an effect that is 
less pronounced than that of fibrates. In patients with the metabolic 
syndrome and diabetes, nicotinic acid may increase fasting glucose 
levels, and clinical trials with nicotinic acid plus a statin have failed 
to reduce ASCVD events. Prescriptions of omega-3 fatty acid prep-
arations  that  include  high  doses  of  eicosapentaenoic  acid  (EPA) 
with or without docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (~1.5–4.5 g/d) lower 
fasting triglyceride levels by ~25–40%. The two omega-3 random-
ized controlled trials associated with ASCVD risk reduction, JELIS 
and REDUCE-IT, used EPA only, whereas STRENGTH, which was 
terminated  prematurely  because  of  futility,  used  EPA  plus  DHA. 
Here,  no  drug  interactions  with  fibrates  or  statins  occur,  and  the 
main side effect of their use is eructation with a fishy taste. Freezing 
the  nutraceutical  can  partially  block  this  unpleasant  side  effect. 
Importantly, lowering triglycerides with any of the pharmaceuticals 
has not proven to be an independent predictor of CVD outcomes. 
HDL CHOLESTEROL (SEE ALSO CHAP. 407)
Very few lipid-modifying compounds increase HDL cholesterol lev-
els. Statins, fibrates, and bile acid sequestrants have modest effects 
(5–10%), whereas ezetimibe and omega-3 fatty acids have no effect. 
Nicotinic acid is the only currently available drug with predictable 
HDL  cholesterol–raising  properties.  The  response  is  dose  related, 
and  nicotinic  acid  can  increase  HDL  cholesterol  by  up  to  30% 
above baseline. After several trials of nicotinic acid versus placebo 
in  statin-treated  patients,  there  is  no  evidence  that  raising  HDL 
cholesterol with nicotinic acid beneficially affects ASCVD events in 
patients with or without the metabolic syndrome. 
BLOOD PRESSURE (SEE ALSO CHAP. 277)
The direct relationship between blood pressure and all-cause mor-
tality rate has been well established in studies comparing patients 
with  hypertension  (>140/90  mmHg),  patients  with  prehyperten-
sion  (>120/80  mmHg  but  <140/90  mmHg),  and  individuals  with 
normal blood pressure (<120/80 mmHg). In patients who have the 
metabolic syndrome without diabetes, the best choice for the initial 
antihypertensive  medication  is  an  angiotensin-converting  enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker, as these two 
classes of drugs are effective and well tolerated. Additional agents 
include a diuretic, calcium channel blocker, beta blocker, and min-
eralocorticoid  inhibitor,  such  as  the  recently  FDA  approved  min-
eralocorticoid  receptor  antagonist  finerenone.  In  all  patients  with 
hypertension, a sodium-restricted dietary pattern enriched in fruits 
and vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products should be 
advocated. Home monitoring of blood pressure may assist in main-
taining good blood pressure control. 
IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE (SEE ALSO CHAP. 403)
In  patients  with  the  metabolic  syndrome  and  type  2  diabetes, 
aggressive  glycemic  control  may  favorably  modify  fasting  levels 
of triglycerides and/or HDL cholesterol. In patients with impaired 
fasting  glucose  who  do  not  have  diabetes,  a  lifestyle  intervention 
that includes weight reduction, dietary saturated fat restriction, and 
increased physical activity has been shown to reduce the incidence

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismof  type  2  diabetes.  Metformin  also  reduces  the  incidence  of  dia-
betes,  although  the  effect  is  less  pronounced  than  that  of  lifestyle 
intervention. 
INSULIN RESISTANCE (SEE ALSO CHAP. 404)
Several  drug  classes  (biguanides,  thiazolidinediones  [TZDs]) 
increase  insulin  sensitivity.  Because  insulin  resistance  is  the  pri-
mary  pathophysiologic  mechanism  for  the  metabolic  syndrome, 
representative  drugs  in  these  classes  reduce  its  prevalence.  Both 
metformin  and  TZDs  enhance  insulin  action  in  the  liver  and 
suppress  endogenous  glucose  production.  TZDs,  but  not  metfor-
min, also improve insulin-mediated glucose uptake in muscle and 
adipose  tissue.  In  a  meta-analysis  of  nine  trials  involving  12,026 
participants,  the  TZD  pioglitazone  versus  placebo  was  associated 
with reduction in ASCVD events in patients with insulin resistance 
(metabolic  syndrome),  prediabetes  and  type  2  diabetes.  However, 
adverse effects including weight gain, bone fracture, and congestive 
heart failure with/or without edema were seen. Benefit of TZDs has 
been seen in patients with NAFLD, and with metformin in women 
with polycystic ovary syndrome, and both drug classes have been 
shown to reduce markers of inflammation.

BONE STRUCTURE AND METABOLISM
Bone is a dynamic tissue that is remodeled constantly throughout life. 
The  arrangement  of  compact  and  cancellous  bone  provides  strength 
and  density  suitable  for  both  mobility  and  protection.  Compact  or 
cortical bone forms the roughly cylindrical shell of long bones; cancel-
lous or trabecular bone forms the plate-like meshwork that internally 
supports the cortical shell. In addition, bone provides a reservoir for

calcium,  magnesium,  phosphorus,  sodium,  and  other  ions  necessary 
for homeostatic functions. Bone also hosts and regulates hematopoiesis 
by providing niches for hematopoietic cell proliferation and differenti-
ation. The skeleton is highly vascular and receives ~10% of the cardiac 
output. Remodeling of bone is accomplished by two distinct cell types: 
osteoblasts  produce  bone  matrix,  and  osteoclasts  resorb  the  matrix. 
The  activities  of  these  cells  are  coordinated  by  osteocytes,  long-lived 
regulatory cells embedded within bone matrix.

The  extracellular  components  of  bone  consist  of  a  solid  mineral 
phase in close association with an organic matrix, of which 90–95% is 
type I collagen (Chap. 413). The noncollagenous portion of the organic 
matrix  is  heterogeneous  and  contains  serum  proteins  such  as  albu-
min  as  well  as  many  locally  produced  proteins,  whose  functions  are 
incompletely understood. Those proteins include cell attachment/sig-
naling proteins such as thrombospondin, osteopontin, and fibronectin;  
calcium-binding proteins such as matrix gla protein and osteocalcin; 
and proteoglycans such as biglycan and decorin. Some of the proteins 
organize collagen fibrils; others influence mineralization and binding 
of the mineral phase to the matrix.

The mineral phase is made up of calcium and phosphate and is best 
characterized as a poorly crystalline hydroxyapatite. The mineral phase 
of bone is deposited initially in intimate relation to the collagen fibrils 
and  is  found  in  specific  locations  in  the  “holes”  between  the  collagen 
fibrils.  This  architectural  arrangement  of  mineral  and  matrix  results 
in  a  two-phase  material  well  suited  to  withstand  mechanical  stresses. 
The organization of collagen influences the amount and type of min-
eral phase formed in bone. Although the primary structures of type I 
collagen in skin and bone tissues are similar, there are differences in 
posttranslational  modifications  and  distribution  of  intermolecular 
cross-links. The holes in the packing structure of the collagen are larger 
in  mineralized  collagen  of  bone  and  dentin  than  in  unmineralized 
collagens such as those in tendon. Single amino acid substitutions in 
the helical portion of either the α1 (COL1A1) or α2 (COL1A2) chains 
of type I collagen disrupt the organization of bone in the disease, oste-
ogenesis  imperfecta.  The  severe  skeletal  fragility  associated  with  this 
group of disorders highlights the importance of the fibrillar matrix in 
the structure of bone (Chap. 413).

Osteoblasts  synthesize  and  secrete  the  organic  matrix  and  regu-
late  its  mineralization.  They  are  derived  from  cells  of  mesenchymal 
origin  (Fig.  409-1A).  Active  osteoblasts  are  found  on  the  surface  of 
newly  forming  bone.  As  an  osteoblast  secretes  matrix,  which  then  is 
mineralized,  the  cell  may  become  an  osteocyte,  still  connected  with 
its  nutrient  supply  through  a  series  of  canaliculi.  Osteocytes  account 
for  the  vast  majority  of  the  cells  in  bone.  They  are  thought  to  be 
the  mechanosensors  in  bone  that  communicate  signals  to  surface 
osteoblasts and osteoclasts and their progenitors through the canalic-
ular network and thereby serve as master regulators of bone formation 
and resorption. Remarkably, osteocytes also secrete fibroblast growth 
factor  23  (FGF23),  a  major  hormonal  regulator  of  phosphate  metab-
olism  (see  below).  Mineralization  of  the  matrix,  both  in  trabecular 
bone  and  in  osteones  of  compact  cortical  bone  (Haversian  systems), 
begins soon after the matrix is secreted (primary mineralization) but 
is not completed for several weeks or even longer (secondary miner-
alization).  Although  this  mineralization  takes  advantage  of  the  high 
concentrations  of  calcium  and  phosphate,  already  near  saturation  in 
serum,  mineralization  is  a  carefully  regulated  process  that  is  depen-
dent on the activity of osteoblast-derived alkaline phosphatase, which 
probably  works  by  hydrolyzing  inhibitors  of  mineralization,  such  as 
pyrophosphate.

Genetic  studies  in  humans  and  mice  have  identified  several  key 
genes  that  control  osteoblast  development.  Runx2  is  a  transcription 
factor  expressed  specifically  in  chondrocyte  (cartilage  cells)  and 
osteoblast  progenitors  as  well  as  in  hypertrophic  chondrocytes  and 
mature  osteoblasts.  Runx2  regulates  the  expression  of  several  impor-
tant osteoblast proteins, including osterix (another transcription factor 
needed  for  osteoblast  maturation),  osteopontin,  bone  sialoprotein, 
type  I  collagen,  osteocalcin,  and  receptor-activator  of  nuclear  factor 
(NF)-κB (RANK) ligand. Runx2 expression is regulated in part by bone 
morphogenic  proteins  (BMPs).  Runx2-deficient  mice  are  devoid  of

osteoblasts, whereas mice with a deletion of only one allele (Runx2 +/–) 
exhibit  a  delay  in  formation  of  the  clavicles  and  some  cranial  bones. 
The latter abnormalities are similar to those in the human disorder clei-
docranial dysplasia, which is also caused by heterozygous inactivating 
mutations in Runx2.

The paracrine signaling molecule, Indian hedgehog (Ihh), also plays 
a critical role in osteoblast development, as evidenced by Ihh-deficient 
mice  that  lack  osteoblasts  in  the  type  of  bone  formed  on  a  cartilage 
mold  (endochondral  ossification).  Signals  originating  from  members 
of  the  wnt  (an  amalgam  of  “wingless,”  the  Drosophila  developmental 
gene and “int-1,” an analogous mammalian gene activated by integra-
tion of a mouse tumor viral genome nearby) family of paracrine factors 
are  also  important  for  osteoblast  proliferation  and  differentiation. 
Osteocytes  regulate  osteoblasts  partly  by  secreting  a  potent  inhibitor 
of wnt signaling called sclerostin. Numerous other growth-regulatory 
factors  affect  osteoblast  function,  including  the  three  closely  related 
transforming  growth  factor  βs,  fibroblast  growth  factors  (FGFs)  2 
and 18, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin-like growth factors 
(IGFs) I and II. Hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D  [1,25(OH)2D]  activate  receptors  expressed 
by  osteoblasts  to  assure  mineral  homeostasis  and  influence  a  variety 
of  bone  cell  functions.  Osteoclasts  that  resorb  bone  (see  below)  also 
regulate osteoblasts by releasing growth factors from bone matrix and 
by synthesizing proteins that can directly regulate osteoblastogenesis.
Resorption of bone is carried out mainly by osteoclasts, multinucle-
ated cells that are formed by fusion of cells derived from the common 
precursor  of  macrophages  and  osteoclasts.  Thus,  these  cells  derive 
from the hematopoietic lineage, quite different from the mesenchymal 
lineage  cells  that  become  osteoblasts.  Multiple  factors  that  regulate 
osteoclast  development  have  been  identified  (Fig.  409-1B).  Factors 
produced  by  osteocytes,  osteoblasts,  and  marrow  stromal  cells  allow 
cells  of  the  osteoblast  lineage  to  control  osteoclast  development  and 

activity. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) plays a critical 
role during several steps in the pathway and ultimately leads to fusion 
of osteoclast progenitor cells to form multinucleated, active osteoclasts. 
RANK  ligand,  a  member  of  the  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  family, 
is  expressed  on  the  surface  of  osteocytes,  osteoblasts,  and  stromal 
fibroblasts. In a process involving cell-cell interactions, RANK ligand 
binds  to  the  RANK  receptor  on  osteoclast  progenitors,  stimulating 
osteoclast differentiation and activation. Alternatively, a soluble decoy 
receptor,  referred  to  as  osteoprotegerin,  can  bind  RANK  ligand  and 
inhibit osteoclast differentiation. Several growth factors and cytokines 
(including interleukins 1, 6, and 11; TNF; and interferon γ) modulate 
osteoclast differentiation and function. Most hormones that influence 
osteoclast function do not target these cells directly but instead target 
cells  of  the  osteoblast  lineage  to  increase  production  of  M-CSF  and 
RANK.  Both  PTH  and  1,25(OH)2D  increase  osteoclast  number  and 
activity by this indirect mechanism. Calcitonin, in contrast, binds to its 
receptor on the basal surface of osteoclasts and directly inhibits osteo-
clast function. Estradiol has multiple cellular targets in bone, including 
osteoclasts,  immune  cells,  and  osteoblasts;  actions  on  all  these  cells 
serve to decrease osteoclast number and decreased bone resorption.

Osteoclast-mediated  resorption  of  bone  takes  place  in  scalloped 
spaces (Howship’s lacunae) where the osteoclasts are attached through 
a  specific  αvβ3  integrin  to  components  of  the  bone  matrix  such  as 
osteopontin. The osteoclast forms a tight seal to the underlying matrix 
and secretes protons, chloride, and proteinases into a confined space 
that has been likened to an extracellular lysosome. The active osteoclast 
surface forms a ruffled border that contains a specialized proton pump 
ATPase that secretes acid that solubilizes the mineral phase. Carbonic 
anhydrase  (type  II  isoenzyme)  within  the  osteoclast  generates  the 
needed protons. The bone matrix is resorbed in the acid environment 
adjacent to the ruffled border by proteases, such as cathepsin K, that 
act at low pH.

PART 12Endocrinology and MetabolismIn  the  embryo  and  the  growing  child,  bone  develops  mostly  by 
replacing previously calcified cartilage (endochondral bone formation) 
with  subsequent  remodeling  or,  in  a  few  bones,  is  formed  without  a 
cartilage  matrix  (intramembranous  bone  formation).  During  endo-
chondral  bone  formation,  chondrocytes  proliferate,  secrete  and  min-
eralize a matrix, enlarge (hypertrophy), and then die, enlarging bone 
and  providing  the  matrix  and  factors  that  stimulate  endochondral 
bone formation. This program is regulated by both local factors such 
as IGF-I and -II, Ihh, parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP), 
BMPs, and FGFs and by systemic hormones such as growth hormone, 
glucocorticoids,  and  estrogen.  Some  hypertrophic  chondrocytes  do 
not die but, instead, through still poorly understood steps, can become 
osteoblasts and bone stromal cells.

New  bone,  whether  formed  in  infants  or  in  adults  during  repair, 
has  a  relatively  high  ratio  of  cells  to  matrix  and  is  characterized  by 
coarse  fiber  bundles  of  collagen  that  are  interlaced  and  randomly 
dispersed  (woven  bone).  In  adults,  the  more  mature  bone  is  orga-
nized  with  fiber  bundles  regularly  arranged  in  parallel  or  concentric 
sheets (lamellar bone). In long bones, deposition of lamellar bone in 
a  concentric  arrangement  around  blood  vessels  forms  the  Haversian 
systems.  Growth  in  length  of  bones  is  dependent  on  proliferation  of 
cartilage  cells  and  the  endochondral  sequence  at  the  growth  plate. 
Growth in width and thickness is accomplished by formation of bone 
at  the  periosteal  surface  and  by  resorption  at  the  endosteal  surface, 
with the rate of formation exceeding that of resorption. In adults, after 
the  growth  plates  of  cartilage  close  through  the  actions  of  estrogen, 
growth  in  length  and  endochondral  bone  formation  cease.  Even  in 
adults,  however,  remodeling  of  bone  (within  Haversian  systems  as 
well  as  along  the  surfaces  of  trabecular  bone)  continues  throughout 
life.  In  adults,  ~4%  of  the  surface  of  trabecular  bone  (such  as  iliac 
crest)  is  involved  in  active  resorption,  whereas  10–15%  of  trabecular 
surfaces are covered with osteoid, unmineralized new bone formed by 
osteoblasts. Radioisotope studies indicate that as much as 18% of the 
total skeletal calcium is deposited and removed each year. Thus, bone 
is  an  active  metabolizing  tissue  that  requires  an  intact  blood  supply. 
The  cycle  of  bone  resorption  and  formation  is  a  highly  orchestrated 
process, directed by osteocytes and carried out by the basic multicel-
lular unit, which is composed of a group of osteoclasts and osteoblasts 
(Fig. 409-2).

The  response  of  bone  to  fractures,  infection,  and  interruption  of 
blood supply and to expanding lesions is relatively limited. Dead bone 
must  be  resorbed,  and  new  bone  must  be  formed,  a  process  carried 
out in association with growth of new blood vessels into the involved 
area. In injuries that disrupt the organization of the tissue, such as a 
fracture,  in  which  apposition  of  fragments  is  poor  or  when  motion 
exists  at  the  fracture  site,  progenitor  stromal  cells  recapitulate  the 
endochondral bone formation of early development and form cartilage

FIGURE  409-2  Schematic  representation  of  bone  remodeling.  The  cycle  of  bone  remodeling  is  carried  out  by  the 
basic multicellular unit (BMU), which consists of a group of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. In cortical bone, the BMUs 
tunnel  through  the  tissue,  whereas  in  cancellous  bone,  they  move  across  the  trabecular  surface.  The  process  of 
bone  remodeling  is  initiated  by  the  recruitment  of  osteoclast  precursors,  perhaps  to  sites  of  microdamage.  These 
precursors fuse to form multinucleated, active osteoclasts that mediate bone resorption. Osteoclasts adhere to bone 
and subsequently remove it by acidification and proteolytic digestion. As the BMU advances, osteoclasts leave the 
resorption  site  and  osteoblasts,  derived  from  marrow  precursors  and  previously  inactive  bone  lining  cells,  move  in 
to cover the excavated area and begin the process of new bone formation by secreting osteoid, which eventually is 
mineralized into new bone. After osteoid mineralization, osteoblasts flatten and form a layer of lining cells over new 
bone, become osteocytes, or die.

that  is  replaced  by  bone  and,  variably,  fibrous  tissue.  When  there  is 
good  apposition  with  fixation  and  little  motion  at  the  fracture  site, 
repair occurs predominantly by formation of new bone without other 
mediating tissue.

Remodeling  of  bone  occurs  along  lines  of  force  generated  by 
mechanical  stress.  The  signals  from  these  mechanical  stresses  are 
sensed  by  osteocytes,  which  transmit  signals  to  osteoclasts  and 
osteoblasts or their precursors. One such signal made by osteocytes is 
sclerostin,  an  inhibitor  of  wnt  signaling.  Mechanical  forces  suppress 
sclerostin production and thus increase bone formation by osteoblasts. 
Expanding  lesions  in  bone  such  as  tumors  induce  resorption  at  the 
surface in contact with the tumor by producing ligands such as PTHrP 
that  stimulate  osteoclast  differentiation  and  function.  Thus,  bone 
plasticity reflects the interaction of cells with each other and with the 
environment.

Measurement  of  the  products  of  osteoblast  and  osteoclast  activ-
ity  can  assist  in  the  diagnosis  and  management  of  bone  diseases. 
Osteoblast activity can be assessed by measuring serum bone-specific 
alkaline  phosphatase.  Similarly,  osteocalcin,  a  protein  secreted  from 
osteoblasts, is made virtually only by osteoblasts. Measurement of an 
amino-terminal fragment of procollagen I is also an effective index of 
bone formation. Osteoclast activity can be assessed by measurement of 
products  of  collagen  degradation.  Collagen  molecules  are  covalently 
linked to each other in the extracellular matrix through the formation 
of  hydroxypyridinium  cross-links  (Chap.  413).  After  digestion  by 
osteoclasts, these cross-linked peptides can be measured both in urine 
and in blood.

CALCIUM METABOLISM
Over  99%  of  the  1–2  kg  of  calcium  present  normally  in  the  adult 
human body resides in the skeleton, where it provides mechanical sta-
bility and serves as a reservoir sometimes needed to maintain extracel-
lular fluid (ECF) calcium concentration (Fig. 409-3). Skeletal calcium 
accretion  first  becomes  significant  during  the  third  trimester  of  fetal 
life, accelerates throughout childhood and adolescence, reaches a peak 
in early adulthood, and gradually declines thereafter at rates that rarely 
exceed 1–2% per year. These slow changes in total skeletal calcium con-
tent contrast with relatively high daily rates of closely matched fluxes of 
calcium into and out of bone (~250–500 mg each), a process mediated 
by  coupled  osteoblastic  and  osteoclastic  activity.  Another  0.5–1%  of 
skeletal calcium is freely exchangeable (e.g., in chemical equilibrium) 
with that in the ECF.

The  concentration  of  ionized  calcium  in  the  ECF  must  be  main-
tained within a narrow range because of the critical role calcium plays 
in a wide array of cellular functions, especially those involved in neu-
romuscular  activity,  secretion,  and  signal  transduction.  Intracellular 
cytosolic free calcium levels are ~100 nmol/L and are 10,000-fold lower 
than  ionized  calcium  concentration  in 
the  blood  and  ECF  (1.1–1.3  mmol/L). 
Cytosolic  calcium  does  not  play  the 
structural  role  played  by  extracellular 
calcium;  instead,  it  serves  a  signaling 
function.  The  steep  chemical  gradient 
of  calcium  from  outside  to  inside  the 
cell  promotes  rapid  calcium 
influx 
through  various  membrane  calcium 
channels  that  can  be  activated  by  hor-
mones,  metabolites,  or  neurotransmit-
ters,  swiftly  changing  cellular  function. 
In  blood,  total  calcium  concentration  is 
normally 2.2–2.6 mM (8.5–10.5 mg/dL), 
of which ~50% is ionized. The remainder 
is  bound  ionically  to  negatively  charged 
proteins  (predominantly  albumin  and 
immunoglobulins) or loosely complexed 
with  phosphate,  citrate,  sulfate,  or  other 
anions. Alterations in serum protein con-
centrations directly affect the total blood 
calcium concentration even if the ionized

FIGURE 409-3  Calcium homeostasis. Schematic illustration of calcium content of 
extracellular fluid (ECF) and bone as well as of diet and feces; magnitude of calcium 
flux  per  day  as  calculated  by  various  methods  is  shown  at  sites  of  transport  in 
intestine,  kidney,  and  bone.  Ranges  of  values  shown  are  approximate  and  were 
chosen to illustrate certain points discussed in the text. In conditions of calcium 
balance, rates of calcium release from and uptake into bone are equal.

calcium concentration remains normal. An algorithm to correct for pro-
tein changes adjusts the total serum calcium (in mg/dL) upward by 0.8 
times the deficit in serum albumin (g/dL) or by 0.5 times the deficit 
in  serum  immunoglobulin  (in  g/dL).  Such  corrections  provide  only 
rough approximations of actual free calcium concentrations, however, 
and may be misleading, particularly during acute illness. Acidosis also 
alters  ionized  calcium  by  reducing  its  association  with  proteins.  The 
best practice is to measure blood ionized calcium directly by a method 
that  employs  calcium-selective  electrodes  in  acute  settings  during 
which calcium abnormalities might occur.

Control of the ionized calcium concentration in the ECF ordinarily 
is  accomplished  by  adjusting  the  rates  of  calcium  movement  across 
intestinal and renal epithelia and into and out of bone. These adjust-
ments  are  mediated  mainly  via  changes  in  blood  levels  of  the  hor-
mones  PTH  and  1,25(OH)2D.  Acting  via  binding  to  calcium-sensing 
receptors  (CaSRs)  on  the  surface  of  parathyroid  cells,  blood  ionized 
calcium suppresses PTH secretion by reducing levels of PTH mRNA 
and promoting the cleavage of PTH to inactive peptides. Also, ionized 
calcium  indirectly  affects  PTH  secretion  by  lowering  1,25(OH)2D 
production.  This  active  vitamin  D  metabolite  inhibits  PTH  produc-
tion by an incompletely understood mechanism of negative feedback  
(Chap. 410).

Normal  dietary  calcium  intake  in  the  United  States  varies  widely, 
ranging from 10 to 37 mmol/d (400–1500 mg/d). A National Academy 
of  Medicine  (formerly,  Institute  of  Medicine)  analysis  recommends 
a  daily  allowance  of  25–30  mmol  (1000–1200  mg)  for  most  adults. 
Intestinal  absorption  of  ingested  calcium  involves  both  active  (tran-
scellular)  and  passive  (paracellular)  mechanisms.  Passive  calcium 
absorption  is  nonsaturable  and  approximates  5%  of  daily  calcium 
intake, whereas active absorption involves apical calcium entry via spe-
cific ion channels (TRPV5 in the kidney and TRPV6 in the intestine), 
whose expression is controlled principally by 1,25(OH)2D. This active 
transport  mechanism  normally  accounts  for  absorption  of  20–70% 
of  dietary  calcium.  Active  calcium  transport  occurs  mainly  in  the 
proximal  small  bowel  (duodenum  and  proximal  jejunum),  although 
some active calcium absorption occurs in most segments of the small 
intestine.  Optimal  rates  of  calcium  absorption  require  gastric  acid. 
This is especially true for weakly dissociable calcium supplements such 
as  calcium  carbonate.  In  fact,  large  boluses  of  calcium  carbonate  are 
poorly  absorbed  because  of  their  neutralizing  effect  on  gastric  acid. 
In achlorhydric subjects and for those taking drugs that inhibit gastric 

acid  secretion,  supplements  should  be  taken  with  meals  to  optimize 
their absorption. Use of calcium citrate may be preferable in these cir-
cumstances. Calcium absorption may also be blunted in disease states 
such as pancreatic or biliary insufficiency, in which ingested calcium 
remains bound to unabsorbed fatty acids or other food constituents. At 
high levels of calcium intake, synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D is reduced; this 
decreases the rate of active intestinal calcium absorption. The opposite 
occurs with dietary calcium restriction. Some calcium, ~2.5–5 mmol/d 
(100–200  mg/d),  is  excreted  as  an  obligate  component  of  intestinal 
secretions and is not regulated by calciotropic hormones.

The feedback-controlled hormonal regulation of intestinal absorp-
tive efficiency results in a relatively constant daily net calcium absorp-
tion of ~5–10 mmol/d (200–400 mg/d) despite large changes in daily 
dietary calcium intake. This daily load of absorbed calcium is excreted 
by the kidneys in a manner that is also tightly regulated by the con-
centration  of  ionized  calcium  in  the  blood.  Approximately  8–10  g/d 
of calcium is filtered by the glomeruli, of which only 2–3% appears in 
the urine. Most filtered calcium (65%) is reabsorbed in the proximal 
tubules via a passive, paracellular route that is coupled to concomitant 
NaCl  reabsorption  and  not  specifically  regulated.  The  cortical  thick 
ascending limb of Henle’s loop (cTAL) reabsorbs roughly another 20% 
of filtered calcium, also via a paracellular mechanism. Calcium reab-
sorption in the cTAL requires a tight-junctional protein called paracel-
lin-1 and is inhibited by increased blood concentrations of calcium or 
magnesium, acting via the CaSR, which is highly expressed on basolat-
eral membranes in this nephron segment. Operation of the renal CaSR 
provides a mechanism, independent of those engaged directly by PTH 
or  1,25(OH)2D,  by  which  serum  ionized  calcium  can  control  renal 
calcium reabsorption. Finally, ~10% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed 
in the distal convoluted tubules (DCTs) by a transcellular mechanism. 
Calcium enters the luminal surface of the cell through specific apical 
calcium channels (TRPV5), whose number is regulated. It then moves 
across  the  cell  in  association  with  a  specific  calcium-binding  protein 
(calbindin-D28k)  that  buffers  cytosolic  calcium  concentrations  from 
the  large  mass  of  transported  calcium.  Ca2+-ATPases  and  Na+/Ca2+ 
exchangers actively extrude calcium across the basolateral surface and 
thereby maintain the transcellular calcium gradient. All these processes 
are stimulated directly or indirectly by PTH. The DCT is also the site of 
action of thiazide diuretics, which lower urinary calcium excretion by 
inducing sodium depletion and thereby augmenting proximal calcium 
reabsorption.  Conversely,  dietary  sodium  loads,  or  increased  distal 
sodium  delivery  caused  by  loop  diuretics  or  saline  infusion,  induce 
calciuresis.

The  homeostatic  mechanisms  that  normally  maintain  a  constant 
serum ionized calcium concentration may fail at extremes of calcium 
intake  or  when  the  hormonal  systems  or  organs  involved  are  com-
promised. Thus, even with maximal activity of the vitamin D–depen-
dent  intestinal  active  transport  system,  sustained  calcium  intakes  
<5 mmol/d (<200 mg/d) cannot provide enough net calcium absorp-
tion  to  replace  obligate  losses  via  the  intestine,  the  kidney,  sweat, 
and other secretions. In this case, increased blood levels of PTH and 
1,25(OH)2D  activate  osteoclastic  bone  resorption  to  obtain  needed 
calcium from bone, which leads to progressive bone loss and negative 
calcium balance. Increased PTH and 1,25(OH)2D also enhance renal 
calcium  reabsorption,  and  1,25(OH)2D  enhances  calcium  absorption 
in  the  gut.  At  very  high  calcium  intakes  (>100  mmol/d  [>4  g/d]), 
passive intestinal absorption continues to deliver calcium into the ECF 
despite maximally downregulated intestinal active transport and renal 
tubular  calcium  reabsorption.  This  can  cause  severe  hypercalciuria, 
nephrocalcinosis,  progressive  renal  failure,  and  hypercalcemia  (e.g., 
“milk-alkali  syndrome”).  Deficiency  or  excess  of  PTH  or  vitamin  D, 
intestinal disease, and renal failure represent other commonly encoun-
tered challenges to normal calcium homeostasis (Chap. 410).

PHOSPHORUS METABOLISM
Although  85%  of  the  ~600  g  of  body  phosphorus  is  present  in  bone 
mineral,  phosphorus  is  also  a  major  intracellular  constituent  both  as 
the free anion(s) and as a component of numerous organophosphate 
compounds,  including  structural  proteins,  enzymes,  transcription

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolism–,  with  perhaps  10%  as  HPO4

factors, carbohydrate and lipid intermediates, high-energy stores (ATP 
[adenosine  triphosphate],  creatine  phosphate),  and  nucleic  acids. 
Unlike  calcium,  phosphorus  exists  intracellularly  at  concentrations 
close to those present in ECF (e.g., 1–2 mmol/L). In cells and in the 
– or 
ECF, phosphorus exists in several forms, predominantly as H2PO4
2–.  This  mixture  of  anions  will 
NaHPO4
be referred to here as “phosphate.” In serum, ~12% of phosphorus is 
bound  to  proteins.  Concentrations  of  phosphates  in  blood  and  ECF 
generally  are  expressed  in  terms  of  elemental  phosphorus,  with  the 
normal  range  in  adults  being  0.75–1.45  mmol/L  (2.5–4.5  mg/dL). 
Because the volume of the intracellular fluid compartment is twice that 
of the ECF, measurements of ECF phosphate may not accurately reflect 
phosphate  availability  within  cells  that  follows  even  modest  shifts  of 
phosphate from one compartment to the other.

Phosphate  is  widely  available  in  foods  and  is  absorbed  efficiently 
(65%) by the small intestine even in the absence of vitamin D. How-
ever, phosphate absorptive efficiency may be enhanced (to 85–90%) via 
active transport mechanisms that are stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D. These 
mechanisms  involve  activation  of  Na+/PO4
2–  co-transporters,  such  as 
Npt2b, that move phosphate into intestinal cells against an unfavorable 
electrochemical  gradient.  Daily  net  intestinal  phosphate  absorption 
varies widely with the composition of the diet but is generally in the 
range  of  500–1000  mg/d.  Phosphate  absorption  can  be  inhibited  by 
large doses of calcium salts or by sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel), 
strategies  commonly  used  to  control  levels  of  serum  phosphate  in 
renal  failure.  Aluminum  hydroxide  antacids  also  reduce  phosphate 
absorption  but  are  used  less  commonly  because  of  the  potential  for 
aluminum  toxicity.  Low  serum  phosphate  stimulates  renal  proximal 
tubular synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D, perhaps by suppressing blood levels 
of FGF23 (see below).

Serum phosphate levels vary by as much as 50% on a normal day. 
This reflects the effect of food intake but also an underlying circadian 
rhythm  that  produces  a  nadir  between  7  and  10  a.m.  Carbohydrate 
administration, especially as IV dextrose solutions in fasting subjects, 
can  decrease  serum  phosphate  by  >0.7  mmol/L  (2  mg/dL)  during 
treatment of ketoacidosis or during metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. 
Because of this wide variation in serum phosphate, it is best to perform 
measurements in the basal, fasting state.

Control  of  serum  phosphate  is  determined  mainly  by  the  rate  of 
renal  tubular  reabsorption  of  the  filtered  load,  which  is  ~4–6  g/d. 
Because  intestinal  phosphate  absorption  is  highly  efficient,  urinary 
excretion  is  not  constant  but  varies  directly  with  dietary  intake.  The 
fractional  excretion  of  phosphate  (ratio  of  phosphate  to  creatinine 
clearance) is generally in the range of 10–15%. The proximal tubule is 
the principal site at which renal phosphate reabsorption is regulated. 
This is accomplished by changes in the levels of apical expression and 
activity of specific Na+/PO4
2– co-transporters (NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c) in 
the proximal tubule. Levels of these transporters at the apical surface of 
these cells are reduced rapidly by PTH, a major hormonal regulator of 
renal phosphate excretion. FGF23 can impair phosphate reabsorption 
dramatically  by  a  similar  mechanism.  Activating  FGF23  mutations 
cause the rare disorder autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets 
(ADHR). In contrast to PTH, FGF23 also leads to reduced synthesis of 
1,25(OH)2D,  which  may  worsen  the  resulting  hypophosphatemia  by 
lowering intestinal phosphate absorption. Renal reabsorption of phos-
phate is responsive to changes in dietary intake such that experimental 
dietary phosphate restriction leads to a dramatic lowering of urinary 
phosphate  within  hours,  preceding  any  decline  in  serum  phosphate 
(e.g.,  filtered  load).  This  physiologic  renal  adaptation  to  changes  in 
dietary phosphate availability occurs independently of PTH and may 
be  mediated  in  part  by  changes  in  levels  of  serum  FGF23.  Findings 
in  FGF23-knockout  mice  suggest  that  FGF23  normally  acts  to  lower 
blood  phosphate  and  1,25(OH)2D  levels.  In  turn,  elevation  of  blood 
phosphate increases blood levels of FGF23.

Renal phosphate reabsorption is impaired by hypocalcemia, hypo-
magnesemia,  and  severe  hypophosphatemia.  Phosphate  clearance  is 
enhanced  by  ECF  volume  expansion  and  impaired  by  dehydration. 
Phosphate retention is an important pathophysiologic feature of renal 
insufficiency (Chap. 311).

 ■ HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
Causes  Hypophosphatemia  can  occur  by  one  or  more  of  three 
primary mechanisms: (1) inadequate intestinal phosphate absorption, 
(2) excessive renal phosphate excretion, and (3) rapid redistribution of 
phosphate from the ECF into bone or soft tissue (Table 409-1). Because 
phosphate is so abundant in foods, inadequate intestinal absorption is 
almost never observed now that aluminum hydroxide antacids, which 
bind phosphate in the gut, are no longer widely used. Fasting or starva-
tion, however, may result in depletion of body phosphate and predis-
pose to subsequent hypophosphatemia during refeeding, especially if 
this is accomplished with IV glucose alone.

Chronic hypophosphatemia usually signifies the presence of a per-
sistent renal tubular phosphate-wasting disorder. Excessive activation 
of PTH/PTHrP receptors in the proximal tubule as a result of primary 
or secondary hyperparathyroidism or because of the PTHrP-mediated 
hypercalcemia  syndrome  in  malignancy  (Chap.  410)  is  among  the 
more common causes of renal hypophosphatemia. Familial hypocalci-
uric hypercalcemia and Jansen’s chondrodystrophy are rare examples of 
genetic disorders in this category (Chap. 410).

Several  genetic  and  acquired  diseases  cause  PTH/PTHrP  recep-
tor-independent tubular phosphate wasting with associated rickets and 
osteomalacia.  All  these  diseases  manifest  severe  hypophosphatemia; 
renal  phosphate  wasting,  sometimes  accompanied  by  aminoaciduria; 
inappropriately  low  blood  levels  of  1,25(OH)2D;  low-normal  serum 
levels of calcium; and evidence of impaired cartilage or bone mineral-
ization. Analysis of these diseases led to the discovery of the hormone 
FGF23,  which  is  an  important  physiologic  regulator  of  phosphate 
metabolism. FGF23 decreases phosphate reabsorption in the proximal 
tubule and also suppresses the 1α-hydroxylase responsible for synthesis 
of 1,25(OH)2D. FGF23 is synthesized by cells of the osteoblast lineage, 
primarily osteocytes. High-phosphate diets increase FGF23 levels, and 
low-phosphate diets decrease them. ADHR was the first disease linked 
to  abnormalities  in  FGF23.  ADHR  results  from  activating  mutations 
in the gene that encodes FGF23. These mutations alter a cleavage site 
that  ordinarily  allows  for  inactivation  of  intact  FGF23.  Several  other 
genetic disorders feature elevated FGF23 and hypophosphatemia. The 
most common of these is X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH), 
which results from inactivating mutations in an endopeptidase termed 
PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases 
on the X chromosome) that is expressed most abundantly on the sur-
face of osteocytes and mature osteoblasts. Patients with XLH usually 
have high FGF23 levels, and ablation of the FGF23 gene reverses the 
hypophosphatemia found in the mouse version of XLH. How inacti-
vation of PHEX leads to increased levels of FGF23 has not been deter-
mined.  Two  rare  autosomal  recessive  hypophosphatemic  syndromes 
associated  with  elevated  FGF23  are  due  to  inactivating  mutations  of 
dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/
phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), respectively, both of which normally are 
highly expressed in bone and presumably regulate FGF23 production. 
An unusual hypophosphatemic disorder, tumor-induced osteomalacia 
(TIO), is an acquired disorder in which tumors, usually of mesenchy-
mal  origin  and  generally  histologically  benign,  secrete  FGF23  that 
induces  renal  phosphate  wasting.  The  hypophosphatemic  syndrome 
resolves completely within hours to days after successful resection of 
the  responsible  tumor.  Such  tumors  typically  express  large  amounts 
of FGF23 mRNA, and patients with TIO usually exhibit elevations of 
FGF23 in their blood.

Dent’s  disease  is  an  X-linked  recessive  disorder  caused  by  inac-
tivating  mutations  in  CLCN5,  a  chloride  transporter  expressed  in 
endosomes  of  the  proximal  tubule;  features  include  hypercalciuria, 
hypophosphatemia,  and  recurrent  kidney  stones.  Renal  phosphate 
wasting  is  common  among  poorly  controlled  diabetic  patients  and 
alcoholics, who therefore are at risk for iatrogenic hypophosphatemia 
when  treated  with  insulin  or  IV  glucose,  respectively.  Diuretics  and 
certain other drugs and toxins can cause defective renal tubular phos-
phate reabsorption (Table 409-1).

In hospitalized patients, hypophosphatemia is often attributable to 
massive  redistribution  of  phosphate  from  the  ECF  into  cells.  Insulin

therapy  for  diabetic  ketoacidosis  is  a  paradigm  for  this  phenome-
non, in which the severity of the hypophosphatemia is related to the 
extent  of  antecedent  depletion  of  phosphate  and  other  electrolytes  
(Chap.  404).  The  hypophosphatemia  is  usually  greatest  at  a  point 
many hours after initiation of insulin therapy and is difficult to predict 
from  baseline  measurements  of  serum  phosphate  at  the  time  of  pre-
sentation, when prerenal azotemia can obscure significant phosphate 
depletion. Other factors that may contribute to such acute redistribu-
tive hypophosphatemia include antecedent starvation or malnutrition, 
administration  of  IV  glucose  without  other  nutrients,  elevated  blood 
catecholamines (endogenous or exogenous), respiratory alkalosis, and 
recovery from metabolic acidosis.

Hypophosphatemia  also  can  occur  transiently  (over  weeks  to 
months) during the phase of accelerated net bone formation that fol-
lows  parathyroidectomy  for  severe  primary  hyperparathyroidism  or 
during treatment of vitamin D deficiency or lytic Paget’s disease. This is 
usually most prominent in patients who preoperatively have evidence 
of high bone turnover (e.g., high serum levels of alkaline phosphatase). 
Osteoblastic metastases can also lead to this syndrome.

Clinical and Laboratory Findings  The clinical manifestations of 
severe hypophosphatemia reflect a generalized defect in cellular energy 
metabolism because of ATP depletion, a shift from oxidative phospho-
rylation toward glycolysis, and associated tissue or organ dysfunction. 
Acute, severe hypophosphatemia occurs mainly or exclusively in hospi-
talized patients with underlying serious medical or surgical illness and 
preexisting phosphate depletion due to excessive urinary losses, severe 
malabsorption, or malnutrition. Chronic hypophosphatemia tends to 
be less severe, with a clinical presentation dominated by musculoskel-
etal complaints such as bone pain, osteomalacia, pseudofractures, and 
proximal muscle weakness or, in children, rickets and short stature.

Neuromuscular  manifestations  of  severe  hypophosphatemia  are 
variable  but  may  include  muscle  weakness,  lethargy,  confusion,  dis-
orientation, hallucinations, dysarthria, dysphagia, oculomotor palsies, 
anisocoria,  nystagmus,  ataxia,  cerebellar  tremor,  ballismus,  hypore-
flexia, impaired sphincter control, distal sensory deficits, paresthesia, 
hyperesthesia, generalized or Guillain-Barré–like ascending paralysis, 
seizures,  coma,  and  even  death.  Serious  sequelae  such  as  paralysis, 
confusion,  and  seizures  are  likely  only  at  phosphate  concentrations 
<0.25  mmol/L  (<0.8  mg/dL).  Rhabdomyolysis  may  develop  during 
rapidly  progressive  hypophosphatemia.  The  diagnosis  of  hypophos-
phatemia-induced  rhabdomyolysis  may  be  overlooked,  as  up  to  30% 
of  patients  with  acute  hypophosphatemia  (<0.7  mM)  have  creatine 
phosphokinase elevations that peak 1–2 days after the nadir in serum 
phosphate, when the release of phosphate from injured myocytes may 
have led to a near normalization of circulating levels of phosphate.

Respiratory  failure  and  cardiac  dysfunction,  which  are  reversible 
with  phosphate  treatment,  may  occur  at  serum  phosphate  levels  of 
0.5–0.8  mmol/L  (1.5–2.5  mg/dL).  Renal  tubular  defects,  including 
tubular acidosis, glycosuria, and impaired reabsorption of sodium and 
calcium, may occur. Hematologic abnormalities correlate with reduc-
tions in intracellular ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and may include 
erythrocyte  microspherocytosis  and  hemolysis;  impaired  oxyhemo-
globin dissociation; defective leukocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and 
bacterial killing; and platelet dysfunction with spontaneous gastroin-
testinal hemorrhage.

TREATMENT
Hypophosphatemia

Severe hypophosphatemia (<0.75 mmol/L [<2 mg/dL]), particularly 
in the setting of underlying phosphate depletion, constitutes a dan-
gerous electrolyte abnormality that should be corrected promptly. 
Unfortunately, the cumulative deficit in body phosphate cannot be 
predicted directly from knowledge of the circulating level of phos-
phate, and therapy must be approached empirically. The threshold 
for IV phosphate therapy and consequently the dose of phosphate to 
be administered should reflect consideration of renal function, the 
likely severity and duration of the underlying phosphate depletion,

Note: Rates shown are calculated for a 70-kg person; levels of serum calcium 
and phosphorus must be measured every 6–12 h during therapy; infusions can

most formulations available in the United States provide 3 mmol/mL of sodium or 
potassium phosphate.

and  the  presence  and  severity  of  symptoms  consistent  with  those 
of  hypophosphatemia.  In  adults,  phosphate  may  be  safely  admin-
istered IV as neutral mixtures of sodium or potassium phosphate 
salts at initial doses of 0.2–0.8 mmol/kg of elemental phosphorus 
over  6  h  (e.g.,  10–50  mmol  over  6  h),  with  doses  >20  mmol/6  h 
reserved for those who have serum levels <0.5 mmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) 
and  normal  renal  function.  A  suggested  approach  is  presented  in 
Table 409-2. Serum levels of phosphate and calcium must be moni-
tored closely (every 6–12 h) throughout treatment. It is necessary to 
avoid a serum calcium-phosphorus product >50 mg2/dL2 to reduce 
the  risk  of  heterotopic  calcification.  Hypocalcemia,  if  present, 
should be corrected before administering IV phosphate. Less severe 
hypophosphatemia,  in  the  range  of  0.5–0.8  mmol/L  (1.5–2.5  mg/
dL), usually can be treated with oral phosphate in divided doses of 
750–2000  mg/d  as  elemental  phosphorus;  higher  doses  can  cause 
bloating and diarrhea.

Management of chronic hypophosphatemia requires knowledge 
of  the  cause(s)  of  the  disorder.  Hypophosphatemia  related  to  the 
secondary  hyperparathyroidism  of  vitamin  D  deficiency  usually 
responds  to  treatment  with  vitamin  D  and  calcium  alone.  XLH, 
ADHR, TIO, and related renal tubular disorders usually are man-
aged with divided oral doses of phosphate, often with calcium and 
1,25(OH)2D supplements to bypass the block in renal 1,25(OH)2D 
synthesis  and  prevent  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  caused  by 
suppression of ECF calcium levels. Care must be taken to be sure 
that oral calcium and phosphate are not administered at the same 
time,  to  avoid  precipitation  before  absorption.  Thiazide  diuretics 
may be used to prevent nephrocalcinosis in patients who are man-
aged  this  way.  Complete  normalization  of  hypophosphatemia  is 
generally  not  possible  in  these  conditions.  Burosumab,  a  human 
monoclonal  antibody  that  inhibits  FGF23,  has  been  approved  for 
the  treatment  of  XLH.  It  corrects  hypophosphatemia,  improves 
bone pain, and heals fractures in both adults and children.

Optimal therapy for TIO is extirpation of the responsible tumor, 
which  may  be  localized  by  radiographic  skeletal  survey  or  bone 
scan  (many  are  located  in  bone)  or  by  radionuclide  scanning 
using sestamibi or labeled octreotide. Successful treatment of TIO- 
induced hypophosphatemia with octreotide has been reported in a 
small number of patients. Burosumab treatment, originally used for 
XLH, also shows promise as a treatment for TIO.

 ■ HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
Causes  When  the  filtered  load  of  phosphate  and  glomerular  fil-
tration  rate  (GFR)  are  normal,  control  of  serum  phosphate  levels  is 
achieved  by  adjusting  the  rate  at  which  phosphate  is  reabsorbed  by

the proximal tubular NaPi-2 co-transporters. The principal hormonal 
regulators of NaPi-2 activity are PTH and FGF23. Hyperphosphatemia, 
defined  in  adults  as  a  fasting  serum  phosphate  concentration  >1.8 
mmol/L (5.5 mg/dL), usually results from impaired glomerular filtra-
tion, hypoparathyroidism, excessive delivery of phosphate into the ECF 
(from bone, gut, or parenteral phosphate therapy), or a combination of 
these  factors  (Table  409-3).  The  upper  limit  of  normal  serum  phos-
phate concentrations is higher in children and neonates (2.4 mmol/L 
[7  mg/dL]).  It  is  useful  to  distinguish  hyperphosphatemia  caused  by 
impaired  renal  phosphate  excretion  from  that  which  results  from 
excessive delivery of phosphate into the ECF (Table 409-3).

In  chronic  renal  insufficiency,  reduced  GFR  leads  to  phosphate 
retention. Hyperphosphatemia in turn further impairs renal synthesis 
of 1,25(OH)2D, increases FGF23 levels, and stimulates PTH secretion 
and  parathyroid  gland  hypertrophy  both  directly  and  indirectly  (by 
lowering  blood  ionized  calcium  levels).  Thus,  hyperphosphatemia  is 
a  major  cause  of  the  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  of  renal  failure 
and must be addressed early in the course of the disease (Chaps. 311 
and 410).

Hypoparathyroidism  leads  to  hyperphosphatemia  via  increased 
expression  of  NaPi-2  co-transporters  in  the  proximal  tubule.  Hypo-
parathyroidism,  or  parathyroid  suppression,  has  multiple  potential 
causes,  including  autoimmune  disease;  developmental,  surgical,  or 
radiation-induced absence of functional parathyroid tissue; vitamin D 
intoxication or other causes of PTH-independent hypercalcemia; cellu-
lar PTH resistance (pseudohypoparathyroidism or hypomagnesemia); 
infiltrative  disorders  such  as  Wilson’s  disease  and  hemochromatosis; 
and  impaired  PTH  secretion  caused  by  hypermagnesemia,  severe 
hypomagnesemia, or activating mutations in the CaSR. Hypocalcemia 
may also contribute directly to impaired phosphate clearance, as cal-
cium  infusion  can  induce  phosphaturia  in  hypoparathyroid  subjects. 
Increased  tubular  phosphate  reabsorption  also  occurs  in  acromegaly, 
during  heparin  administration,  and  in  tumoral  calcinosis.  Tumoral

3164 calcinosis  is  caused  by  a  rare  group  of  genetic  disorders  in  which 
FGF23 is processed in a way that leads to low levels of active FGF23 
in  the  bloodstream.  This  may  result  from  mutations  in  the  FGF23 
sequence  or  via  inactivating  mutations  in  the  GALNT3  gene,  which 
encodes  a  galactosaminyl  transferase  that  normally  adds  sugar  resi-
dues  to  FGF23  that  slow  its  proteolysis.  A  similar  syndrome  results 
from FGF23 resistance due to inactivating mutations of the FGF23 co- 
receptor Klotho. These abnormalities cause elevated serum 1,25(OH)2D, 
parathyroid suppression, increased intestinal calcium absorption, and 
focal hyperostosis with large, lobulated periarticular heterotopic ossifi-
cations (especially at shoulders or hips) and are accompanied by hyper-
phosphatemia. In some forms of tumoral calcinosis, serum phosphorus 
levels are normal.

When  large  amounts  of  phosphate  are  delivered  rapidly  into  the 
ECF,  hyperphosphatemia  can  occur  despite  normal  renal  function. 
Examples  include  overzealous  IV  phosphate  therapy,  oral  or  rectal 
administration of large amounts of phosphate-containing laxatives or 
enemas (especially in children), extensive soft tissue injury or necrosis 
(crush  injuries,  rhabdomyolysis,  hyperthermia,  fulminant  hepatitis, 
cytotoxic  chemotherapy),  extensive  hemolytic  anemia,  and  transcel-
lular  phosphate  shifts  induced  by  severe  metabolic  or  respiratory 
acidosis.
Clinical  Findings  The  clinical  consequences  of  acute,  severe 
hyperphosphatemia  are  due  mainly  to  the  formation  of  widespread 
calcium  phosphate  precipitates  and  resulting  hypocalcemia.  Thus, 
tetany, seizures, accelerated nephrocalcinosis (with renal failure, hyper-
kalemia,  hyperuricemia,  and  metabolic  acidosis),  and  pulmonary  or 
cardiac  calcifications  (including  development  of  acute  heart  block) 
may occur. The severity of these complications relates to the elevation 
of serum phosphate levels, which can reach concentrations as high as  
7  mmol/L  (20  mg/dL)  in  instances  of  massive  soft  tissue  injury  or 
tumor lysis syndrome.

TREATMENT
Hyperphosphatemia

Therapeutic options for management of severe hyperphosphatemia 
are limited. Volume expansion may enhance renal phosphate clear-
ance.  Aluminum  hydroxide  antacids  or  sevelamer  may  be  helpful 
in  chelating  and  limiting  absorption  of  offending  phosphate  salts 
present  in  the  intestine.  Hemodialysis  is  the  most  effective  ther-
apeutic  strategy  and  should  be  considered  early  in  the  course  of 
severe hyperphosphatemia, especially in the setting of renal failure 
and symptomatic hypocalcemia.

MAGNESIUM METABOLISM
Magnesium is the major intracellular divalent cation. Normal concentra-
tions of extracellular magnesium and calcium are crucial for normal neu-
romuscular activity. Intracellular magnesium forms a key complex with 
ATP and is an important cofactor for a wide range of enzymes, transport-
ers, and nucleic acids required for normal cellular function, replication, 
and  energy  metabolism.  The  concentration  of  magnesium  in  serum 
is  closely  regulated  within  the  range  of  0.7–1  mmol/L  (1.5–2  meq/L; 
1.7–2.4  mg/dL),  of  which  30%  is  protein-bound  and  another  15%  is 
loosely complexed to phosphate and other anions. One-half of the 25 
g (1000 mmol) of total body magnesium is located in bone, only one-
half of which is insoluble in the mineral phase. Almost all extraskeletal 
magnesium is present within cells, where the total concentration is 5 
mM,  95%  of  which  is  bound  to  proteins  and  other  macromolecules. 
Because only 1% of body magnesium resides in the ECF, measurements 
of serum magnesium levels may not accurately reflect the level of total 
body magnesium stores.

Dietary magnesium content normally ranges from 6 to 15 mmol/d 
(140–360 mg/d), of which 30–40% is absorbed, mainly in the jejunum 
and  ileum.  Intestinal  magnesium  absorptive  efficiency  is  stimulated 
by  1,25(OH)2D  and  can  reach  70%  during  magnesium  deprivation. 
Urinary magnesium excretion normally matches net intestinal absorp-
tion and is ~4 mmol/d (100 mg/d). Regulation of serum magnesium 

concentrations  is  achieved  mainly  by  control  of  renal  magnesium 
reabsorption.  Only  20%  of  filtered  magnesium  is  reabsorbed  in  the 
proximal  tubule,  whereas  60%  is  reclaimed  in  the  cTAL  and  another 
5–10% in the DCT. Magnesium reabsorption in the cTAL occurs via a 
paracellular route that requires both a lumen-positive potential, created 
by NaCl reabsorption, and tight-junction proteins encoded by mem-
bers of the Claudin gene family. Magnesium reabsorption in the cTAL 
is increased by PTH but inhibited by hypercalcemia or hypermagne-
semia, both of which activate the CaSR in this nephron segment.
 ■ HYPOMAGNESEMIA
Causes  Hypomagnesemia  usually  signifies  substantial  depletion 
of  body  magnesium  stores  (0.5–1  mmol/kg).  Hypomagnesemia  can 
result from intestinal malabsorption; protracted vomiting, diarrhea, or 
intestinal  drainage;  defective  renal  tubular  magnesium  reabsorption; 
or rapid shifts of magnesium from the ECF into cells, bone, or third 
spaces (Table 409-4). Dietary magnesium deficiency is unlikely except 
possibly in the setting of alcoholism. A rare genetic disorder that causes 
selective  intestinal  magnesium  malabsorption  has  been  described 
(primary infantile hypomagnesemia). Another rare inherited disorder 
(hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia) is caused by muta-
tions in the gene encoding TRPM6, a protein that, along with TRPM7, 
forms  a  channel  important  for  both  intestinal  and  distal-tubular 
renal  transcellular  magnesium  transport.  Malabsorptive  states,  often 
compounded by vitamin D deficiency, can critically limit magnesium 
absorption  and  produce  hypomagnesemia  despite  the  compensatory 
effects  of  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  and  of  hypocalcemia  and 
hypomagnesemia  to  enhance  cTAL  magnesium  reabsorption.  Diar-
rhea or surgical drainage fluid may contain ≥5 mmol/L of magnesium. 
Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole and others) may produce hypo-
magnesemia  by  an  unknown  mechanism  that  does  not  involve  renal 
wasting of magnesium.

Several genetic magnesium-wasting syndromes have been described, 
including  inactivating  mutations  of  genes  encoding  the  DCT  NaCl 
co-transporter  (Gitelman’s  syndrome),  proteins  required  for  cTAL 
Na-K-2Cl  transport  (Bartter’s  syndrome),  claudin  16  or  claudin  19 
(autosomal  recessive  renal  hypomagnesemia  with  hypercalciuria), 
a  DCT  Na+,K+-ATPase  γ-subunit  (autosomal  dominant  renal  hypo-
magnesemia  with  hypocalciuria),  DCT  K+  channels  (Kv1.1,  Kir4.1), 
and  a  mitochondrial  gene  encoding  a  tRNA.  Activating  mutations 
of  the  CaSR  can  cause  hypomagnesemia  as  well  as  hypocalcemia. 
ECF  expansion,  hypercalcemia,  and  severe  phosphate  depletion  may 
impair magnesium reabsorption, as can various forms of renal injury, 
including those caused by drugs such as cisplatin, cyclosporine, amino-
glycosides,  and  pentamidine  as  well  as  the  epidermal  growth  factor 
(EGF) receptor inhibitory antibody cetuximab (EGF action is required 
for normal DCT apical expression of TRPM6) (Table 409-4). A rising 
blood  concentration  of  ethanol  directly  impairs  tubular  magnesium 
reabsorption, and persistent glycosuria with osmotic diuresis leads to 
magnesium wasting and probably contributes to the high frequency of 
hypomagnesemia  in  poorly  controlled  diabetic  patients.  Magnesium 
depletion  is  aggravated  by  metabolic  acidosis,  which  causes  intracel-
lular losses as well.

Hypomagnesemia due to rapid shifts of magnesium from ECF into 
the intracellular compartment can occur during recovery from diabetic 
ketoacidosis, starvation, or respiratory acidosis. Less acute shifts may 
be  seen  during  rapid  bone  formation  after  parathyroidectomy,  with 
treatment  of  vitamin  D  deficiency,  or  with  osteoblastic  metastases. 
Large  amounts  of  magnesium  may  be  lost  with  acute  pancreatitis, 
extensive  burns,  or  protracted  and  severe  sweating  and  during  preg-

tremor,  seizures,  muscle  weakness,  ataxia,  nystagmus,  vertigo,  apa-
thy,  depression,  irritability,  delirium,  and  psychosis.  Patients  are 
usually  asymptomatic  when  serum  magnesium  concentrations  are  
>0.5  mmol/L  (1  meq/L;  1.2  mg/dL),  although  the  severity  of  symp-
toms  may  not  correlate  well  with  serum  magnesium  levels.  Cardiac

arrhythmias  may  occur,  including  sinus  tachycardia,  other  supraven-
tricular  tachycardias,  and  ventricular  arrhythmias.  Electrocardio-
graphic  abnormalities  may  include  prolonged  PR  or  QT  intervals, 
T-wave  flattening  or  inversion,  and  ST  straightening.  Sensitivity  to 
digitalis toxicity may be enhanced.

Other  electrolyte  abnormalities  often  seen  with  hypomagnesemia, 
including  hypocalcemia  (with  hypocalciuria)  and  hypokalemia,  may 
not  be  easily  corrected  unless  magnesium  is  administered  as  well. 
The  hypocalcemia  may  be  a  result  of  concurrent  vitamin  D  defi-
ciency,  although  hypomagnesemia  can  cause  impaired  synthesis  of 
1,25(OH)2D,  cellular  resistance  to  PTH,  and,  at  very  low  serum 

magnesium (<0.4 mmol/L [<0.8 meq/L; <1 mg/dL]), a defect in PTH 
secretion; these abnormalities are reversible with therapy.

TREATMENT
Hypomagnesemia

Mild,  asymptomatic  hypomagnesemia  may  be  treated  with  oral 
magnesium salts (MgCl2, MgO, Mg[OH]2) in divided doses total-
ing 20–30 mmol/d (40–60 meq/d). Diarrhea may occur with larger 
doses.  More  severe  hypomagnesemia  should  be  treated  parenter-
ally,  preferably  with  IV  MgCl2,  which  can  be  administered  safely 
as a continuous infusion of 50 mmol/d (100 meq Mg2+/d) if renal 
function is normal. If GFR is reduced, the infusion rate should be 
lowered by 50–75%. Use of IM MgSO4 is discouraged; the injections 
are  painful  and  provide  relatively  little  magnesium  (2  mL  of  50% 
MgSO4  supplies  only  4  mmol).  MgSO4  may  be  given  IV  instead 
of MgCl2, although the sulfate anions may bind calcium in serum 
and urine and aggravate hypocalcemia. Serum magnesium should 
be  monitored  at  intervals  of  12–24  h  during  therapy,  which  may 
continue  for  several  days  because  of  impaired  renal  conservation 
of  magnesium  (only  50–70%  of  the  daily  IV  magnesium  dose  is 
retained) and delayed repletion of intracellular deficits, which may 
be as high as 1–1.5 mmol/kg (2–3 meq/kg).

It  is  important  to  consider  the  need  for  calcium,  potassium, 
and phosphate supplementation in patients with hypomagnesemia. 
Vitamin D deficiency frequently coexists and should be treated with 
oral or parenteral vitamin D or 25(OH)D (but not with 1,25(OH)2D, 
which  may  impair  tubular  magnesium  reabsorption,  possibly  via 
PTH suppression). In severely hypomagnesemic patients with con-
comitant hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, administration of 
IV  magnesium  alone  may  worsen  hypophosphatemia,  provoking 
neuromuscular symptoms or rhabdomyolysis, due to rapid stimu-
lation of previously suppressed PTH secretion. This is avoided by 
administering both calcium and magnesium.

 ■ HYPERMAGNESEMIA
Causes  Hypermagnesemia  is  rarely  seen  in  the  absence  of  renal 
insufficiency as normal kidneys can excrete large amounts (250 mmol/d) 
of magnesium. Mild hypermagnesemia due to excessive reabsorption 
in  the  cTAL  occurs  with  CaSR  mutations  in  familial  hypocalciuric 
hypercalcemia  and  has  been  described  in  some  patients  with  adre-
nal  insufficiency,  hypothyroidism,  or  hypothermia.  Massive  exoge-
nous  magnesium  exposures,  usually  via  the  gastrointestinal  tract, 
can  overwhelm  renal  excretory  capacity  and  cause  life-threatening 
hypermagnesemia  (Table  409-5).  A  notable  example  of  this  is  pro-
longed  retention  of  even  normal  amounts  of  magnesium-containing 
cathartics in patients with intestinal ileus, obstruction, or perforation. 
Extensive soft tissue injury or necrosis also can deliver large amounts of 
magnesium into the ECF in patients who have suffered trauma, shock,

3166 sepsis, cardiac arrest, or severe burns. Further, infusion of magnesium 

in pregnant women with eclampsia can lead to hypocalcemia.

Clinical and Laboratory Findings  The most prominent clinical 
manifestations of hypermagnesemia are vasodilation and neuromuscu-
lar blockade, which may appear at serum magnesium concentrations 
>2  mmol/L  (>4  meq/L;  >4.8  mg/dL).  Hypotension  that  is  refractory 
to  vasopressors  or  volume  expansion  may  be  an  early  sign.  Nausea, 
lethargy,  and  weakness  may  progress  to  respiratory  failure,  paralysis, 
and coma, with hypoactive tendon reflexes, at serum magnesium levels 
>4 mmol/L. Other findings may include gastrointestinal hypomotility 
or  ileus;  facial  flushing;  pupillary  dilation;  paradoxical  bradycardia; 
prolongation of PR, QRS, and QT intervals; heart block; and, at serum 
magnesium levels approaching 10 mmol/L, asystole.

Hypermagnesemia,  acting  via  the  CaSR,  causes  hypocalcemia  and 
hypercalciuria due to both parathyroid suppression and impaired cTAL 
calcium reabsorption.

TREATMENT
Hypermagnesemia

Successful treatment of hypermagnesemia generally involves iden-
tifying and interrupting the source(s) of magnesium and employing 
measures  to  increase  magnesium  clearance  from  the  ECF.  Use  of 
magnesium-free  cathartics  or  enemas  may  be  helpful  in  clearing 
ingested  magnesium  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Vigorous  IV 
hydration  should  be  attempted,  if  appropriate.  Hemodialysis  is 
effective  and  may  be  required  in  patients  with  significant  renal 
insufficiency.  Calcium,  administered  IV  in  doses  of  100–200  mg 
over 1–2 h, has been reported to provide temporary improvement 
in signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia.

VITAMIN D
 ■ SYNTHESIS AND METABOLISM
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] is the major steroid hormone 
involved  in  regulation  of  mineral  ion  homeostasis.  Vitamin  D  and 
its  metabolites  are  hormones  and  hormone  precursors  rather  than 
vitamins, since in the proper biologic setting, they can be synthesized 
endogenously  (Fig.  409-4).  In  response  to  ultraviolet  radiation  of  the 
skin,  a  photochemical  cleavage  results  in  the  formation  of  vitamin  D 
from  7-dehydrocholesterol.  Cutaneous  production  of  vitamin  D  is 
decreased  by  melanin  and  high  solar  protection  factor  sunblocks, 
which  effectively  impair  skin  penetration  by  ultraviolet  light.  The 
increased use of sunblocks in North America and Western Europe and 
a reduction in the magnitude of solar exposure of the general popula-
tion over the past several decades has led to an increased reliance on 
dietary sources of vitamin D. In the United States and Canada, these 
sources largely consist of fortified cereals and dairy products, in addi-
tion to fish oils and egg yolks. Vitamin D from plant sources is in the 
form of vitamin D2, whereas that from animal sources is vitamin D3. 
These  two  forms  have  equivalent  biologic  activity  and  are  activated 
equally  well  by  the  vitamin  D  hydroxylases  in  humans.  Vitamin  D 
enters the circulation, whether absorbed from the intestine or synthe-
sized cutaneously, bound to vitamin D–binding protein, an α-globulin 
synthesized  in  the  liver.  Vitamin  D  is  subsequently  25-hydroxylated 
in  the  liver  by  a  cytochrome  P450  oxidase  in  the  mitochondria  and 
microsomes. The activity of this hydroxylase is not tightly regulated, 
and the resultant metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], is the 
major circulating and storage form of vitamin D. Approximately 88% of 
25(OH)D circulates bound to the vitamin D–binding protein, 0.03% is 
free, and the rest circulates bound to albumin. The half-life of 25(OH)
D  is  ~2–3  weeks,  with  that  of  25(OH)D2  being  shorter  than  that  of 
25(OH)D3 due to a lower affinity of vitamin D–binding protein for the 
former. The half-life of 25(OH)D is also greatly shortened when vita-
min D–binding protein levels are reduced, as can occur with increased 
urinary losses in the nephrotic syndrome.

The second hydroxylation, required for the formation of the mature 
hormone,  occurs  in  the  kidney  (Fig.  409-5).  The  25-hydroxyvitamin

FIGURE 409-4  Vitamin D synthesis and activation. Vitamin D is synthesized in the 
skin  in  response  to  ultraviolet  radiation  and  also  is  absorbed  from  the  diet.  It  is 
then transported to the liver, where it undergoes 25-hydroxylation. This metabolite 
is  the  major  circulating  form  of  vitamin  D.  The  final  step  in  hormone  activation, 
1α-hydroxylation, occurs in the kidney.

D-1α-hydroxylase  (encoded  by  the  CYP27B1  gene)  is  a  tightly  regu-
lated cytochrome P450–like mixed-function oxidase expressed in the 
proximal  convoluted  tubule  cells  of  the  kidney.  PTH  and  hypophos-
phatemia are the major inducers of this microsomal enzyme in the kid-
ney, whereas calcium, FGF23, and the enzyme’s product, 1,25(OH)2D, 
repress  it.  The  25-hydroxyvitamin  D-1α-hydroxylase  is  also  present 
in  numerous  other  cell  types,  where  it  is  not  subject  to  hormonal 
regulation. It is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes, but keratinocyte 
production of 1,25(OH)2D is not thought to contribute to circulating 
levels of this hormone. In addition to being present in the trophoblastic 
layer of the placenta, the 1α-hydroxylase is produced by macrophages 
associated with granulomas and lymphomas. In these latter pathologic 
states, the activity of the enzyme is induced by interferon γ and TNF-α 
but is not regulated by calcium or 1,25(OH)2D; therefore, hypercalce-
mia, associated with elevated levels of 1,25(OH)2D, may be observed. 
Treatment  of  sarcoidosis-associated  hypercalcemia  with  glucocorti-
coids,  ketoconazole,  or  chloroquine  reduces  1,25(OH)2D  production 
and effectively lowers serum calcium. In contrast, chloroquine has not 
been shown to lower the elevated serum 1,25(OH)2D levels in patients 
with lymphoma.

The major pathway for inactivation of vitamin D metabolites is an 
additional  hydroxylation  step  by  the  vitamin  D  24-hydroxylase,  an 
enzyme  that  is  expressed  in  most  tissues.  1,25(OH)2D  is  the  major 
inducer  of  this  enzyme;  therefore,  this  hormone  promotes  its  own 
inactivation,  thereby  limiting  its  biologic  effects.  FGF23  also  induces 
this  hydroxylase,  thereby  reducing  circulating  1,25(OH)2D  levels 
by  increasing  its  inactivation,  as  well  as  by  impairing  its  synthesis.

FIGURE 409-5  Schematic representation of the hormonal control loop for vitamin 
D metabolism and function. A reduction in the serum calcium below ~2.2 mmol/L 
(8.8 mg/dL) prompts a proportional increase in the secretion of parathyroid hormone 
(PTH)  and  so  mobilizes  additional  calcium  from  the  bone.  PTH  promotes  the 
synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D in the kidney, which in turn stimulates the mobilization of 
calcium  from  bone  and  intestine  and  regulates  the  synthesis  of  PTH  by  negative 
feedback.

Mutations  of  the  gene  encoding  this  enzyme  (CYP24A1)  can  lead  to 
infantile hypercalcemia, and in those less severely affected, long-stand-
ing hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis can occur.

Polar  metabolites  of  1,25(OH)2D  are  secreted  into  the  bile  and 
reabsorbed via the enterohepatic circulation. Impairment of this recir-
culation,  which  is  seen  with  diseases  of  the  terminal  ileum,  leads  to 
accelerated losses of vitamin D metabolites.
 ■ ACTIONS OF 1,25(OH)2D
1,25(OH)2D  mediates  its  biologic  effects  by  binding  to  a  member  of 
the nuclear receptor superfamily, the vitamin D receptor (VDR). This 
receptor belongs to the subfamily that includes the thyroid hormone 
receptors,  the  retinoid  receptors,  and  the  peroxisome  proliferator–
activated receptors; however, in contrast to the other members of this 
subfamily, only one VDR isoform has been isolated. The VDR binds to 
target DNA sequences as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor, 
recruiting a series of coactivators that modify chromatin and approx-
imate the VDR to the basal transcriptional apparatus, resulting in the 
induction of target gene expression. The mechanism of transcriptional 
repression by the VDR varies with different target genes but has been 
shown  to  involve  either  interference  with  the  action  of  activating

transcription factors or the recruitment of novel proteins to the VDR 
complex, resulting in transcriptional repression.

The  affinity  of  the  VDR  for  1,25(OH)2D  is  approximately  three 
orders of magnitude higher than that for other vitamin D metabolites. 
In normal physiologic circumstances, these other metabolites are not 
thought  to  stimulate  receptor-dependent  actions.  However,  in  states 
of  vitamin  D  toxicity,  the  markedly  elevated  levels  of  25(OH)D  may 
lead  to  hypercalcemia  by  interacting  directly  with  the  VDR  and  by 
displacing 1,25(OH)2D from vitamin D–binding protein, resulting in 
increased bioavailability of the active hormone.

The  VDR  is  expressed  in  a  wide  range  of  cells  and  tissues.  The 
molecular  actions  of  1,25(OH)2D  have  been  studied  most  extensively 
in tissues involved in the regulation of mineral ion homeostasis. This 
hormone is a major inducer of calbindin 9K, a calcium-binding protein 
expressed in the intestine, which is thought to play an important role in 
the active transport of calcium across the enterocyte. The two major cal-
cium transporters expressed by intestinal epithelia, TRPV5 and TRPV6 
(transient receptor potential vanilloid), are also vitamin D responsive. 
By inducing the expression of these and other genes in the small intes-
tine, 1,25(OH)2D increases the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorp-
tion, and it also has been shown to have several important actions in 
the  skeleton.  The  VDR  is  expressed  in  osteoblasts  and  regulates  the 
expression of several genes in this cell. These genes include the bone 
matrix  proteins  osteocalcin  and  osteopontin,  which  are  upregulated 
by 1,25(OH)2D, in addition to type I collagen, which is transcription-
ally repressed by 1,25(OH)2D. Both 1,25(OH)2D and PTH induce the 
expression of RANK ligand, which promotes osteoclast differentiation 
and  increases  osteoclast  activity,  by  binding  to  RANK  on  osteoclast 
progenitors and mature osteoclasts. This is the mechanism by which 
1,25(OH)2D induces bone resorption. 1,25(OH)2D regulates phosphate 
homeostasis, primarily by inducing the expression of FGF23 in osteo-
cytes.  However,  the  skeletal  features  associated  with  VDR-knockout 
mice (rickets, osteomalacia) are largely corrected by increasing calcium 
and  phosphorus  intake,  underscoring  the  importance  of  vitamin  D 
action in the gut.

The VDR is expressed in the parathyroid gland, and 1,25(OH)2D has 
been  shown  to  have  antiproliferative  effects  on  parathyroid  cells  and 
to suppress the transcription of the parathyroid hormone gene. These 
effects of 1,25(OH)2D on the parathyroid gland are an important part 
of the rationale for current therapies directed at preventing and treating 
hyperparathyroidism associated with renal insufficiency.

The VDR is also expressed in tissues and organs that do not play a 
role in mineral ion homeostasis. Notable in this respect is the obser-
vation  that  1,25(OH)2D  has  an  antiproliferative  effect  on  several  cell 
types, including keratinocytes, breast cancer cells, and prostate cancer 
cells.  The  effects  of  1,25(OH)2D  and  the  VDR  on  keratinocytes  are 
particularly  intriguing,  since  the  VDR  is  primarily  a  transcriptional 
repressor  in  these  cells.  Alopecia  is  seen  in  humans  and  mice  with 
mutant  VDRs  but  is  not  a  feature  of  vitamin  D  deficiency;  thus,  the 
effects of the VDR on the hair follicle are ligand-independent.

 ■ VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
The mounting concern about the relationship between solar exposure 
and  the  development  of  skin  cancer  has  led  to  increased  reliance  on 
dietary  sources  of  vitamin  D.  Although  the  prevalence  of  vitamin  D 
deficiency varies, the third National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES III) revealed that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent 
throughout the United States, with the prevalence being >29% in obese 
children. The clinical syndrome of vitamin D deficiency can be a result 
of deficient production of vitamin D in the skin, lack of dietary intake, 
accelerated losses of vitamin D, impaired vitamin D activation, or resis-
tance to the biologic effects of 1,25(OH)2D (Table 409-6). The elderly 
and nursing home residents are particularly at risk for vitamin D defi-
ciency, since both the efficiency of vitamin D synthesis in the skin and 
the absorption of vitamin D from the intestine decline with age. The 
presence of terminal ileal disease also results in impaired enterohepatic 
circulation  of  vitamin  D  metabolites.  While  intestinal  malabsorption 
of  dietary  fats  and  short  bowel  syndrome,  including  that  associated 
with intestinal bypass surgery, lead to vitamin D deficiency, the cause

of vitamin D deficiency in obese individuals is poorly understood. In 
addition  to  intestinal  diseases,  accelerated  inactivation  of  vitamin  D 
metabolites  can  be  seen  with  drugs  that  induce  hepatic  cytochrome 
P450  mixed-function  oxidases  such  as  barbiturates,  phenytoin,  and 
rifampin.  Gain-of-function  mutations  in  CYP3A4  accelerate  the  oxi-
dation  and  inactivation  of  vitamin  D  metabolites,  thus  resulting  in 
decreased  serum  levels  of  25OHD  and  1,25(OH)2D.  This  form  of 
rickets is autosomal recessive and presents during early childhood and 
can  be  treated  with  high  doses  of  calcitriol  or  vitamin  D.  Impaired 
25-hydroxylation,  associated  with  severe  liver  disease  or  isoniazid,  is 
an uncommon cause of vitamin D deficiency. A mutation in the gene 
responsible for 25-hydroxylation has been identified in a few kindreds. 
Increased circulating FGF23 levels impair 1α-hydroxylation, prevent-
ing  the  production  of  1,25(OH)2D.  High  levels  of  FGF23  are  seen  in 
those with genetic disorders associated with hypophosphatemic rick-
ets,  the  most  common  of  which  is  X-linked  hypophosphatemia,  and 
are  prevalent  in  populations  with  profound  renal  dysfunction.  Thus, 
therapeutic  interventions  should  be  considered  in  patients  whose 
creatinine clearance is <0.5 mL/s (30 mL/min). Mutations in the renal 
1α-hydroxylase  are  the  basis  for  the  genetic  disorder  pseudovitamin 
D–deficiency rickets (also called vitamin D–dependent rickets type I). 
This autosomal recessive disorder presents with the syndrome of vita-
min D deficiency in the first year of life. Patients present with growth 
retardation,  rickets,  and  hypocalcemic  seizures.  Serum  1,25(OH)2D 
levels  are  low  despite  normal  25(OH)D  levels  and  elevated  PTH 
levels. Treatment with vitamin D metabolites that do not require 1α- 
hydroxylation for activity results in disease remission, although lifelong 
therapy is required. A second autosomal recessive disorder, hereditary 
vitamin  D–resistant  rickets  (also  called  vitamin  D-dependent  rickets 
type II), a consequence of vitamin D receptor mutations, is a greater 
therapeutic challenge. These patients present in a similar fashion dur-
ing the first year of life, but alopecia often accompanies the disorder, 
demonstrating a functional role of the VDR in the keratinocyte stem 
cell  population  required  for  hair  follicle  regeneration.  Serum  levels 
of  1,25(OH)2D  are  dramatically  elevated  in  these  individuals  both 
because  of  increased  production  due  to  stimulation  of  1α-hydroxy-
lase activity as a consequence of secondary hyperparathyroidism and 
because of impaired inactivation since induction of the 24-hydroxylase 
by  1,25(OH)2D  requires  an  intact  VDR.  Since  the  receptor  mutation 
results  in  hormone  resistance,  daily  calcium  and  phosphate  infu-
sions  may  be  required  to  bypass  the  defect  in  intestinal  mineral  ion 
absorption.

Regardless  of  the  cause,  the  clinical  manifestations  of  vitamin  D 
deficiency  are  largely  a  consequence  of  impaired  intestinal  calcium 
absorption. Mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency is asymptomatic, 
whereas  long-standing  vitamin  D  deficiency  results  in  hypocalcemia 
accompanied  by  secondary  hyperparathyroidism,  impaired  mineral-
ization of the skeleton (osteopenia on x-ray or decreased bone mineral 
density), and proximal myopathy. Vitamin D deficiency also has been 
shown to be associated with an increase in overall mortality, including 

cardiovascular  causes.  In  the  absence  of  an  intercurrent  illness,  the 
hypocalcemia  associated  with  long-standing  vitamin  D  deficiency 
rarely presents with acute symptoms of hypocalcemia such as numb-
ness, tingling, and seizures. However, the concurrent development of 
hypomagnesemia, which impairs parathyroid function, or the admin-
istration  of  potent  bisphosphonates,  which  impair  bone  resorption, 
can  lead  to  acute  symptomatic  hypocalcemia  in  vitamin  D–deficient 
individuals.

Rickets and Osteomalacia 
In children, before epiphyseal fusion, 
vitamin  D  deficiency  results  in  growth  retardation  associated  with 
an  expansion  of  the  growth  plate  known  as  rickets.  Three  layers  of 
chondrocytes are present in the normal growth plate: the reserve zone, 
the  proliferating  zone,  and  the  hypertrophic  zone.  Rickets  associated 
with impaired vitamin D action is characterized by expansion of the 
hypertrophic chondrocyte layer. The expansion of the growth plate is a 
consequence of impaired apoptosis of the late hypertrophic chondro-
cytes, an event that precedes replacement of these cells by osteoblasts 
during endochondral bone formation. Investigations in murine models 
demonstrate  that  hypophosphatemia,  which  in  vitamin  D  deficiency 
is a consequence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, is a key etiologic 
factor in the development of the rachitic growth plate. Impaired actions 
specific to vitamin D also contribute to the expansion of the hypertro-
phic layer in the rachitic growth plate.

The hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia that accompany vitamin 
D deficiency result in impaired mineralization of bone matrix proteins, 
a  condition  known  as  osteomalacia.  Osteomalacia  is  also  a  feature 
of  long-standing  hypophosphatemia,  which  may  result  from  renal 
phosphate wasting, or chronic use of etidronate or phosphate-binding 
antacids.  This  hypomineralized  matrix  is  biomechanically  inferior  to 
normal bone; as a result, patients with osteomalacia are prone to bow-
ing of weight-bearing extremities and skeletal fractures. Vitamin D and 
calcium supplementation have been shown to decrease the incidence 
of hip fracture among ambulatory nursing home residents in France, 
suggesting that undermineralization of bone contributes significantly 
to morbidity in the elderly. Proximal myopathy is a striking feature of 
severe vitamin D deficiency both in children and in adults. Rapid reso-
lution of the myopathy is observed upon vitamin D treatment.

Although vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of rickets 
and osteomalacia, many disorders lead to inadequate mineralization of 
the growth plate and bone. Calcium deficiency without vitamin D defi-
ciency,  the  disorders  of  vitamin  D  metabolism  previously  discussed, 
and hypophosphatemia can all lead to inefficient mineralization. Even 
in the presence of normal calcium and phosphate levels, chronic aci-
dosis and drugs such as bisphosphonates can lead to osteomalacia. The 
inorganic  calcium/phosphate  mineral  phase  of  bone  cannot  form  at 
low  pH.  Bisphosphonates  bind  to  and  prevent  hydroxyapatite  crystal 
growth.  Since  alkaline  phosphatase  is  necessary  for  normal  mineral 
deposition, probably because the enzyme can hydrolyze inhibitors of 
mineralization  such  as  inorganic  pyrophosphate,  genetic  inactivation 
of  the  alkaline  phosphatase  gene  (hereditary  hypophosphatasia)  also 
can lead to osteomalacia in the setting of normal calcium and phos-
phate levels.

Diagnosis of Vitamin D Deficiency, Rickets, and Osteomalacia  
The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in otherwise 
healthy  individuals  is  a  serum  25(OH)D  level.  Although  the  normal 
ranges  vary,  levels  of  25(OH)D  <37  nmol/L  (<15  ng/mL)  are  associ-
ated with increasing PTH levels and lower bone density. The National 
Academy of Medicine has defined vitamin D sufficiency as a vitamin D 
level >50 nmol/L (>20 ng/mL), although higher levels may be required 
to optimize intestinal calcium absorption in the elderly and those with 
underlying disease states, including obesity. Vitamin D deficiency leads 
to  impaired  intestinal  absorption  of  calcium,  resulting  in  decreased 
serum total and ionized calcium values. This hypocalcemia results in 
secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially 
maintains  serum  calcium  levels  at  the  expense  of  the  skeleton.  Due 
to  the  PTH-induced  increase  in  bone  turnover,  alkaline  phosphatase 
levels  are  often  increased.  In  addition  to  increasing  bone  resorption,

PTH  decreases  urinary  calcium  excretion  while  promoting  phos-
phaturia.  This  results  in  hypophosphatemia,  which  exacerbates  the 
mineralization defect in the skeleton. With prolonged vitamin D defi-
ciency resulting in osteomalacia, calcium stores in the skeleton become 
relatively  inaccessible,  since  osteoclasts  cannot  resorb  unmineralized 
osteoid, and frank hypocalcemia ensues. Since PTH is a major stimulus 
for the renal 25(OH)D 1α-hydroxylase, there is increased synthesis of 
the active hormone, 1,25(OH)2D. Paradoxically, levels of this hormone 
are often normal in severe vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, measure-
ments of 1,25(OH)2D are not accurate reflections of vitamin D stores 
and should not be used to diagnose vitamin D deficiency in patients 
with normal renal function.

Radiologic  features  of  vitamin  D  deficiency  in  children  include  a 
widened, expanded growth plate that is characteristic of rickets. These 
findings not only are apparent in the long bones but also are present 
at  the  costochondral  junction,  where  the  expansion  of  the  growth 
plate leads to swellings known as the “rachitic rosary.” Impairment of 
intramembranous  bone  mineralization  leads  to  delayed  fusion  of  the 
calvarial sutures and a decrease in the radiopacity of cortical bone in 
the long bones. If vitamin D deficiency occurs after epiphyseal fusion, 
the  main  radiologic  finding  is  a  decrease  in  cortical  thickness  and 
relative  radiolucency  of  the  skeleton.  A  specific  radiologic  feature  of 
osteomalacia, whether associated with phosphate wasting or vitamin D 
deficiency, is pseudofractures, or Looser’s zones. These are radiolucent 
lines that occur where large arteries are in contact with the underlying 
skeletal elements; it is thought that the arterial pulsations lead to the 
radiolucencies. As a result, these pseudofractures are usually a few mil-
limeters wide, are several centimeters long, and are seen particularly in 
the scapula, the pelvis, and the femoral neck.

TREATMENT
Vitamin D Deficiency

Based  on  the  National  Academy  of  Medicine  2010  report,  the  rec-
ommended daily intake of vitamin D is 600 IU from 1 to 70 years of 
age, and 800 IU for those >70. Based on the observation that 800 IU 
of vitamin D, with calcium supplementation, decreases the risk of 
hip  fractures  in  elderly  women,  this  higher  dose  is  thought  to  be 
an appropriate daily intake for prevention of vitamin D deficiency 
in  adults.  The  Vitamin  D  and  Omega-3  Trial  (VITAL)  revealed 
that supplementation of vitamin D in people >50 years of age with 
normal  vitamin  D  levels,  at  doses  above  the  recommended  daily 
intake,  does  not  further  improve  bone  mineral  density  or  skeletal 
microarchitecture  and  does  not  prevent  falls.  The  safety  margin 
for  vitamin  D  is  large,  and  vitamin  D  toxicity  usually  is  observed 
only in patients taking doses in the range of 40,000 IU daily. Treat-
ment of vitamin D deficiency should be directed at the underlying 
disorder, if possible, and also should be tailored to the severity of 
the condition. Vitamin D should always be repleted in conjunction 
with  calcium  supplementation  since  most  of  the  consequences  of 
vitamin D deficiency are a result of impaired mineral ion homeosta-
sis. In patients in whom 1α-hydroxylation is impaired, metabolites 
that do not require this activation step are the treatment of choice. 
They  include  1,25(OH)2D3  (calcitriol  [Rocaltrol],  0.25–0.5  μg/d) 
and 1α-hydroxyvitamin D2 (doxercalciferol [Hectorol], 2.5–5 μg/d). 
Outside  the  United  States,  1α-hydroxyvitamin  D3,  (alfacalcidol 
[One-Alpha] (0.25–1.0 μg/d) is also used. If the pathway required 
for  activation  of  vitamin  D  is  intact,  severe  vitamin  D  deficiency 
can  be  treated  with  pharmacologic  repletion  initially  (50,000  IU 
weekly  for  3–12  weeks),  followed  by  maintenance  therapy  (800 
IU daily). Pharmacologic doses may be required for maintenance 
therapy  in  patients  who  are  taking  medications  such  as  barbitu-
rates  or  phenytoin  that  accelerate  metabolism  of  or  cause  resis-
tance  to  1,25(OH)2D.  Polymorphisms  in  the  25-hydroxylase  and 
the  24-hydroxylase  genes  can  also  lead  to  different  responses  to 
the  normal  recommended  daily  intake  of  vitamin  D.  The  hepatic 
enzyme  cytochrome  P450  3A4  (CYP3A4)  is  a  strong  inducer  of 
the  catabolism  of  vitamin  D  metabolites.  Polymorphisms  of  the

CYP3A4 gene and certain drugs, such as phenytoin and rifampin, 
lead  to  strong  induction  of  this  enzyme;  thus,  those  affected  may 
also require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation. Calcium 
supplementation  should  include  1.5–2  g/d  of  elemental  calcium. 
Normocalcemia is usually observed within 1 week of the institution 
of  therapy,  although  increases  in  PTH  and  alkaline  phosphatase 
levels  may  persist  for  3–6  months.  The  most  efficacious  methods 
to  monitor  treatment  and  resolution  of  vitamin  D  deficiency  are 
serum  and  urinary  calcium  measurements.  In  patients  who  are 
vitamin  D  replete  and  are  taking  adequate  calcium  supplementa-
tion, the 24-h urinary calcium excretion should be in the range of 
100–250  mg/24  h.  Lower  levels  suggest  problems  with  adherence 
to the treatment regimen or with absorption of calcium or vitamin 
D supplements. Levels >250 mg/24 h predispose to nephrolithiasis 
and should lead to a reduction in vitamin D dosage and/or calcium 
supplementation.

Parathyroid Gland and 
Calcium Homeostasis

PARATHYROID GLAND DISORDERS
 ■ INTRODUCTION
Four  parathyroid  glands  are  located  posterior  to  the  thyroid  gland. 
They  produce  parathyroid  hormone  (PTH),  which  is  the  primary 
regulator of calcium physiology. PTH acts directly on bone, where it 
induces calcium (and phosphate) release, and on the kidney, where it 
enhances  calcium  reabsorption  in  the  distal  tubules.  In  the  proximal 
renal tubules, PTH increases excretion of phosphate and the synthesis 
of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D), a hormone that increases

3170 gastrointestinal  calcium  absorption.  Serum  PTH  levels  are  tightly 
regulated  by  a  negative  feedback  loop.  Calcium,  acting  through  the 
calcium-sensing  receptor,  and  vitamin  D,  acting  through  its  nuclear 
receptor,  reduce  PTH  release  and  synthesis.  Additional  evidence 
indicates  that  fibroblast  growth  factor  23  (FGF23),  a  phosphaturic 
hormone,  can  suppress  PTH  secretion.  Understanding  the  hormonal 
pathways  that  regulate  calcium  and  phosphate  levels  as  well  as  bone 
metabolism  is  essential  for  effective  diagnosis  and  management  of  a 
wide array of hyper- and hypocalcemic disorders.

Hyperparathyroidism, characterized by excess production of PTH, 
is  a  common  cause  of  hypercalcemia  and  is  usually  the  result  of 
autonomously functioning adenomas or hyperplasia. Surgery for this 
disorder  is  highly  effective  and  has  been  shown  to  reverse  some  of 
the  deleterious  effects  of  long-standing  PTH  excess  on  bone  density. 
Humoral  hypercalcemia  of  malignancy  (HHM)  is  also  a  common 
cause  of  hypercalcemia,  which  is  usually  due  to  the  overproduction 
of parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP) by cancer cells. The 
similarities in the biochemical characteristics of hyperparathyroidism 
and HHM, first noted by Albright in 1941, are now known to reflect 
the actions of PTH and PTHrP through the same G protein–coupled 
PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTHR1). The converse, namely hypocalcemia, 
can be caused by the lack of functional PTH, i.e., hypoparathyroidism, 
or by reduced PTH responsiveness of the proximal renal tubules, i.e., 
pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP).

The  genetic  basis  of  hyperparathyroidism,  multiple  endocrine 
neoplasia (MEN) types 1 and 2, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia 
(FHH), Jansen’s syndrome, different forms of hypoparathyroidism and 
PHP, disorders of excess urinary phosphate excretion and of vitamin D 
synthesis, action, and metabolism, and the molecular events associated 
with  parathyroid  gland  neoplasia  has  provided  new  insights  into  the 
regulation  of  calcium  and  phosphate  homeostasis.  In  addition,  PTH 
and  possibly  some  of  its  analogues  are  promising  therapeutic  agents 
for  the  treatment  of  postmenopausal  or  senile  osteoporosis,  and  cal-
cimimetic  agents,  which  activate  the  calcium-sensing  receptor,  have 
provided new approaches for PTH suppression.

PARATHYROID GLAND DISORDERS
 ■ PTH
Structure and Physiology  PTH is an 84-amino-acid single-chain 
peptide. The amino-terminal portion, PTH(1–34), is highly conserved 
and  is  critical  for  the  biologic  actions  of  the  molecule.  Modified  syn-
thetic fragments of the amino-terminal sequence as small as PTH(1–11) 
are sufficient to activate the PTH/PTHrP receptor, if provided at high 
enough  concentrations  (see  below).  The  carboxyl-terminal  portions 
of full-length PTH(1–84) also can bind to a separate binding protein/
receptor;  however,  its  properties  and  biologic  role(s),  if  any,  remain 
undefined.

The primary function of PTH is to maintain the extracellular fluid 
(ECF) calcium concentration within a narrow normal range. The hor-
mone acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on the intestine 
through its effects on synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D to increase serum cal-
cium concentrations; in turn, PTH production is closely regulated by 
the concentration of serum ionized calcium. This feedback system is 
the critical homeostatic mechanism for maintenance of ECF calcium. 
Any tendency toward hypocalcemia, as might be induced by calcium- 
or vitamin D–deficient diets, is counteracted by an increased secretion 
of  PTH.  This  in  turn  (1)  increases  the  rate  of  dissolution  of  bone 
mineral, thereby increasing the flow of calcium (and phosphate) from 
bone into blood; (2) reduces the renal clearance of calcium, returning 
more of the calcium and phosphate filtered at the glomerulus into ECF; 
and (3) increases the efficiency of calcium absorption in the intestine 
by  stimulating  the  production  of  1,25(OH)2D.  Immediate  control  of 
blood calcium is due to PTH effects on bone and, to a lesser extent, on 
renal calcium clearance. Maintenance of steady-state calcium balance, 
on  the  other  hand,  probably  results  from  the  effects  of  1,25(OH)2D 
on  calcium  absorption  (Chap.  409).  The  renal  actions  of  PTH  are 
exerted at multiple sites and include an increase in urinary phosphate 

excretion  (proximal  tubule),  augmentation  of  calcium  reabsorption 
(distal tubule), and stimulation of the renal 25(OH)D-1α-hydroxylase. 
As much as 12 mmol (500 mg) of calcium is transferred between the 
ECF and bone each day (a large amount in relation to the total ECF 
calcium pool), and PTH has a major effect on this transfer. The homeo-
static role of the hormone can preserve calcium concentration in blood 
at the cost of bone demineralization.

PTH has multiple actions on bone, some direct and some indirect. 
PTH-mediated  changes  in  bone  calcium  release  can  be  seen  within 
minutes.  The  chronic  effects  of  PTH  are  to  increase  the  number  of 
bone cells, both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and to increase the remod-
eling of bone; these effects are apparent within hours after the hormone 
is  given  and  persist  for  hours  after  PTH  is  withdrawn.  Continuous 
exposure  to  elevated  PTH  (as  in  hyperparathyroidism  or  long-term 
infusions  in  animals)  leads  to  increased  osteoclast-mediated  bone 
resorption. However, the intermittent administration of small amounts 
of  PTH,  elevating  hormone  levels  for  1–2  h  each  day,  leads  to  a  net 
increase of bone mass rather than bone loss. Striking increases, espe-
cially in trabecular bone in the spine and hip, have been reported with 
the use of PTH. PTH(1–34) as monotherapy caused a highly significant 
reduction in fracture incidence in a worldwide placebo-controlled trial.
Osteoblasts  (or  their  stromal  cell  precursors),  which  have  PTH/
PTHrP receptors, are crucial to this bone-forming effect of PTH. When 
PTH activates PTH/PTHrP receptors on osteocytes, release of calcium 
from the matrix surrounding these cells is enhanced; osteoclasts, which 
mediate bone breakdown, lack such receptors. PTH-mediated stimula-
tion of osteoclasts is indirect, acting in part through cytokine released 
from osteoblasts to activate osteoclasts; in experimental studies of bone 
resorption  in  vitro,  osteoblasts  must  be  present  for  PTH  to  activate 
osteoclasts to resorb bone (Chap. 409).

Synthesis,  Secretion,  and  Metabolism 
•	 SYNTHESIS  Para-
thyroid  cells  have  multiple  methods  of  adapting  to  increased  needs 
for PTH production. Most rapid (within minutes) is secretion of pre-
formed hormone in response to hypocalcemia. Second, within hours, 
PTH mRNA expression is induced by sustained hypocalcemia. Finally, 
protracted challenge leads within days to cellular replication to increase 
parathyroid gland mass.

PTH is initially synthesized as a larger molecule (preproparathyroid 
hormone, consisting of 115 amino acids). After a first cleavage step to 
remove the “pre” sequence of 25 amino acid residues, a second cleavage 
step removes the “pro” sequence of 6 amino acid residues before secre-
tion  of  the  mature  peptide  comprising  84  residues.  Mutations  in  the 
prepro-region of the gene can cause hypoparathyroidism by interfering 
with hormone synthesis, transport, or secretion.

Transcriptional  suppression  of  the  PTH  gene  by  calcium  is  nearly 
maximal  at  physiologic  calcium  concentrations.  Hypocalcemia 
increases  transcriptional  activity  within  hours.  1,25(OH)2D  strongly 
suppresses  PTH  gene  transcription.  In  patients  with  chronic  kid-
ney  disease  (CKD),  IV  administration  of  supraphysiologic  levels  of 
1,25(OH)2D  or  analogues  of  this  active  metabolite  can  dramatically 
suppress  PTH  overproduction  and  is  thus  used  clinically  to  con-
trol  severe  secondary  hyperparathyroidism.  Regulation  of  proteolytic 
destruction  of  preformed  hormone  (posttranslational  regulation  of 
hormone  production)  is  an  important  mechanism  for  mediating 
rapid (within minutes) changes in hormone availability. High calcium 
increases and low calcium inhibits the proteolytic destruction of stored 
hormone.
REGULATION  OF  PTH  SECRETION  PTH  secretion  increases  steeply 
to  a  maximum  value  of  about  five  times  the  basal  rate  of  secretion 
as  the  calcium  concentration  falls  from  normal  to  1.9–2.0  mmol/L  
(7.6–8.0  mg/dL;  measured  as  total  calcium).  However,  the  ionized 
fraction  of  blood  calcium  is  the  important  determinant  of  hormone 
secretion.  Severe  intracellular  magnesium  deficiency  impairs  PTH 
secretion (see below).

ECF calcium controls PTH secretion by interaction with a calcium-
sensing  receptor  (CaSR),  a  G  protein–coupled  receptor  (GPCR)  for 
which Ca2+ ions act as the primary ligand (see below). This receptor, 
which  also  has  phosphate  binding  sites,  is  a  member  of  a  distinctive

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismsubgroup of the GPCR superfamily that mediates its actions through 
two  closely  related  alpha-subunits  of  signaling  G  proteins,  namely 
Gαq  and  Gα11,  and  is  characterized  by  a  large  extracellular  domain 
suitable for “clamping” the small-molecule ligand. Stimulation of the 
CaSR  by  high  calcium  levels  suppresses  PTH  secretion.  The  CaSR  is 
present in parathyroid glands and the calcitonin-secreting cells of the 
thyroid (C cells), as well as in multiple other sites, including brain and 
kidney. Genetic evidence has revealed a key biologic role for the CaSR 
in  parathyroid  gland  responsiveness  to  calcium  and  in  renal  calcium 
clearance. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in CaSR cause the 
syndrome of FHH, in which the blood calcium abnormality resembles 
that  observed  in  hyperparathyroidism  but  with  hypocalciuria;  two 
more recently defined variants of FHH, namely FHH2 and FHH3, are 
caused either by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in Gα11, the 
alpha-subunit of one of the signaling proteins downstream of the CaSR, 
or by heterozygous mutations in AP2A1. Homozygous loss-of-function 
mutations in the CaSR are the cause of severe neonatal hyperparathy-
roidism, a disorder that is typically lethal if not treated within the first 
days of life. On the other hand, heterozygous gain-of-function muta-
tions  cause  a  form  of  hypocalcemia  resembling  hypoparathyroidism 
(see below).
METABOLISM  The  secreted  form  of  PTH  is  indistinguishable  by 
immunologic  criteria  and  by  molecular  size  from  the  84-amino-acid 
peptide  (PTH[1–84])  extracted  from  glands.  However,  much  of  the 
immunoreactive material found in the circulation is smaller than the 
extracted  or  secreted  hormone.  The  principal  circulating  fragments 
of  immunoreactive  hormone  lack  a  portion  of  the  critical  amino- 
terminal  sequence  required  for  biologic  activity  and,  hence,  are  bio-
logically  inactive  fragments  (so-called  middle  and  carboxyl-terminal 
fragments). Much of the proteolysis of hormone occurs in the liver and 
kidney. Peripheral metabolism of PTH does not appear to be regulated 
by  physiologic  states  (high  vs  low  calcium,  etc.);  hence,  peripheral 
metabolism  of  hormone,  although  responsible  for  rapid  clearance  of 
secreted hormone, appears to be a high-capacity, metabolically invari-
ant catabolic process.

The  rate  of  clearance  of  the  secreted  84-amino-acid  peptide  from 
blood is more rapid than the rate of clearance of the biologically inac-
tive  fragment(s)  corresponding  to  the  middle  and  carboxyl-terminal 
regions  of  PTH.  Consequently,  the  interpretation  of  results  obtained 
with  earlier  PTH  radioimmunoassays  was  influenced  by  the  nature 
of the peptide fragments detected by the anti-PTH antibodies used in 
these assays.

Although the problems inherent in PTH measurements have been 
largely circumvented by use of double-antibody immunometric assays, 
it  is  now  known  that  some  of  these  assays  detect,  besides  the  intact 
molecule, large amino-terminally truncated forms of PTH, which are 
present in normal and uremic individuals in addition to PTH(1–84). 
The  concentration  of  these  fragments  relative  to  that  of  full-length 
PTH(1–84) is higher with induced hypercalcemia than in eucalcemic 
or  hypocalcemic  conditions  and  is  higher  in  patients  with  impaired 
renal  function.  PTH(7–84)  has  been  identified  as  a  major  compo-
nent  of  these  amino-terminally  truncated  fragments.  Some  evidence 
suggests that the PTH(7–84) (and probably related amino-terminally

truncated  fragments)  can  act,  through  yet  undefined  mechanisms, 
as an inhibitor of PTH action and may therefore be of clinical signif-
icance,  particularly  in  patients  with  CKD.  In  this  group  of  patients, 
efforts to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism by a variety of mea-
sures  (vitamin  D  analogues,  higher  calcium  intake,  higher  dialysate 
calcium,  phosphate-lowering  strategies,  and  calcimimetic  drugs)  can 
lead to oversuppression of the parathyroid glands since some amino- 
terminally  truncated  PTH  fragments,  such  as  PTH(7–84),  react  in 
many  immunometric  PTH  assays  (now  termed  second-generation 
assays;  see  below  under  “Diagnosis”),  thus  overestimating  the  lev-
els  of  biologically  active,  intact  PTH.  Excessive  parathyroid  gland 
suppression  in  CKD  can  lead  to  adynamic  bone  disease  (see  below), 
which  has  been  associated  in  children  with  further  impaired  growth 
and increased bone fracture rates in adults and can furthermore lead 
to  significant  hypercalcemia.  The  measurement  of  PTH  with  newer 
third-generation immunometric assays, which use detection antibodies 
directed against extreme amino-terminal PTH epitopes and thus detect 
only full-length PTH(1–84), may provide some advantage to prevent 
bone disease in CKD.

 ■ PTHRP
Structure  and  Physiology  PTHrP  is  responsible  for  most 
instances  of  HHM  (Chap.  93),  a  syndrome  that  resembles  primary 
hyperparathyroidism but without elevated PTH levels. Most cell types 
normally produce PTHrP, including brain, pancreas, heart, lung, mam-
mary  tissue,  placenta,  endothelial  cells,  and  smooth  muscle.  In  fetal 
animals, PTHrP directs transplacental calcium transfer, and high con-
centrations of PTHrP are produced in mammary tissue and secreted 
into milk, but the biologic significance of this hormone in breast milk 
is unknown. PTHrP also plays an essential role in endochondral bone 
formation and in branching morphogenesis of the breast and possibly 
in uterine contraction and other biologic functions.

PTH and PTHrP, although products of different genes, exhibit con-
siderable  functional  and  structural  homology  (Fig.  410-1)  and  have 
evolved from a shared ancestral gene. The structure of the gene encod-
ing human PTHrP, however, is more complex than that of PTH, con-
taining multiple additional exons, which can undergo alternate splicing 
patterns  during  formation  of  the  mature  mRNA.  Protein  products 
of 139, 141, and 173 amino acids are produced, and other molecular 
forms may result from tissue-specific degradation at accessible internal 
cleavage sites. The biologic roles of these various molecular species and 
the nature of the circulating forms of PTHrP are unclear. In fact, it is 
uncertain whether PTHrP circulates at any significant level in healthy 
children and adults. As a paracrine factor, PTHrP may be produced, 
act, and be destroyed locally within tissues. In adults, PTHrP appears 
to have little influence on calcium homeostasis, except in disease states, 
when large tumors, especially of the squamous cell type as well as renal 
cell carcinomas, lead to massive overproduction of the hormone and 
hypercalcemia.

Both PTH and PTHrP bind to and activate the PTH/PTHrP recep-
tor.  The  PTH/PTHrP  receptor  (also  known  as  the  PTH-1  receptor, 
PTHR1) belongs to a subfamily of GPCRs that includes the receptors 
for calcitonin, glucagon, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and a

Close structural (and functional) homology exists between the first 30 amino acids of hPTH and hPTHrP. The PTHrP sequence may be ≥139 amino acid residues in length. 
PTH  is  only  84  residues  long;  after  residue  30,  there  is  little  structural  homology  between  the  two.  Dashed  lines  in  the  PTHrP  sequence  indicate  identity;  underlined 
residues, although different from those of PTH, still represent conservative changes (charge or polarity preserved). Ten amino acids are identical, and a total of 20 of 30 are 
homologues.

3172 few  other  peptides.  Although  both  ligands  activate  the  PTHR1,  the 
two peptides induce distinct responses in the receptor, which explains 
how  a  single  receptor  without  isoforms  can  serve  different  biologic 
roles. The extracellular regions of the receptor are involved in hormone 
binding,  and  the  intracellular  domains,  after  hormone  activation, 
bind G protein subunits to transduce hormone signaling into cellular 
responses through the stimulation of second messenger formation. A 
second receptor that binds PTH, originally termed the PTH-2 receptor 
(PTH2R), is primarily expressed in brain, pancreas, and testis. Differ-
ent mammalian PTHR1s respond equivalently to PTH and PTHrP, at 
least when tested with traditional assays, whereas the human PTH2R 
responds  efficiently  only  to  PTH,  but  not  to  PTHrP.  PTH2Rs  from 
other  species  show  little  or  no  stimulation  of  second-messenger  for-
mation in response to PTH or PTHrP. In fact, the endogenous ligand 
of the PTH2R was shown to be a hypothalamic peptide referred to as 
tubular  infundibular  peptide  of  39  residues,  TIP39,  that  is  distantly 
related to PTH and PTHrP. The PTHR1 and the PTH2R can be traced 
backward  in  evolutionary  time  to  fish.  Furthermore,  the  zebrafish 
genome  contains,  in  addition  to  the  PTHR1  and  the  PTH2R  ortho-
logs,  a  third  receptor,  the  PTH3R,  that  is  more  closely  related  to  the 
fish  PTHR1  than  to  the  fish  PTH2R.  The  evolutionary  conservation 
of  structure  and  function  suggests  important  biologic  roles  for  these 
receptors, even in fish, which lack discrete parathyroid glands but pro-
duce two molecules that are closely related to mammalian PTH.

Studies using the cloned PTHR1 confirm that it can be coupled to 
more than one G protein and second-messenger pathway, apparently 
explaining  the  multiplicity  of  pathways  stimulated  by  PTH.  Activa-
tion  of  protein  kinases  (A  and  C)  and  calcium  transport  channels  is 
associated with a variety of hormone-specific tissue responses. These 
responses include inhibition of phosphate and bicarbonate transport, 
stimulation of calcium transport, and activation of renal 1α-hydroxy-
lase in the kidney. The responses in bone include effects on collagen 
synthesis, alkaline phosphatase, ornithine decarboxylase, citrate decar-
boxylase,  and  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  activities;  phos-
pholipid synthesis; and calcium and phosphate transport. Ultimately, 
these biochemical events lead to an integrated hormonal response in 
bone turnover and calcium homeostasis. PTH also activates Na+/Ca2+ 
exchangers at renal distal tubular sites and stimulates translocation of 
preformed calcium transport channels, moving them from the interior 
to  the  apical  surface  to  increase  tubular  uptake  of  calcium.  PTH- 
dependent stimulation of phosphate excretion involves reduced expres-
sion  of  two  sodium-dependent  phosphate  co-transporters,  NPT2a 
and  NPT2c,  at  the  apical  membrane,  thereby  reducing  phosphate 
reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules. Similar mechanisms may 
be involved in other renal tubular transporters that are influenced by 
PTH.  Recent  studies  reaffirm  the  critical  linkage  of  blood  phosphate 
lowering to net calcium entry into blood by PTH action and emphasize 
the participation of bone cells other than osteoclasts in the rapid calci-
um-elevating actions of PTH.

PTHrP  exerts  important  developmental  influences  on  fetal  bone 
development  and  in  adult  physiology.  Homozygous  ablation  of  the 
gene  encoding  PTHrP  (or  disruption  of  the  PTHR1  gene)  in  mice 
causes a lethal phenotype in which animals are born with pronounced 
acceleration of chondrocyte maturation that resembles a lethal form of 
chondrodysplasia  in  humans  that  is  caused  by  homozygous  or  com-
pound heterozygous, inactivating PTHR1 mutations (Fig. 410-2). Het-
erozygous inactivating PTHR1 mutations in humans furthermore can 
be a cause of delayed tooth eruption, while heterozygous inactivating 
PTHrP mutations lead to premature growth plate closure and reduced 
adult heights.

 ■ CALCITONIN
(See also Chap. 388) Calcitonin is a peptide hormone with hypocal-
cemic properties that in several mammalian species acts as an indirect 
antagonist  to  the  calcemic  actions  of  PTH.  Calcitonin  seems  to  be 
of limited physiologic significance in humans, at least with regard to 
calcium homeostasis. It is of medical significance because of its role as 
a tumor marker in sporadic and hereditary cases of medullary thyroid 
carcinoma  and  its  medical  use  as  an  adjunctive  treatment  in  severe

Parathyroid  hormone  (PTH;  endocrine-calcium  homeostasis)  and  PTH-related 
peptide (PTHrP; paracrine–multiple tissue actions including growth plate cartilage 
in developing bone) use the single receptor for their disparate functions mediated 
by the amino-terminal 34 residues of either peptide. Other regions of both ligands

hypercalcemia  and  in  Paget’s  disease  of  bone.  Levels  can  also  be  ele-
vated in patients with PHP.

The  hypocalcemic  activity  of  calcitonin  is  accounted  for  primarily  by 
inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and secondarily by stim-
ulation of renal calcium clearance. These effects are mediated by recep-
tors on osteoclasts and renal tubular cells. Calcitonin exerts additional 
effects through receptors present in the brain, the gastrointestinal tract, 
and the immune system. The hormone, for example, exerts analgesic 
effects  directly  on  cells  in  the  hypothalamus  and  related  structures, 
possibly  by  interacting  with  receptors  for  related  peptide  hormones 
such  as  calcitonin  gene–related  peptide  (CGRP)  or  amylin.  Both  of 
these  ligands  have  specific  high-affinity  receptors  that  share  consid-
erable structural similarity with the PTHR1 and can also bind to and 
activate calcitonin receptors. The calcitonin receptor shares consider-
able structural similarity with the PTHR1.

The naturally occurring calcitonins consist of a peptide chain of 32 
amino acids. There is considerable sequence variability among species. 
Calcitonin from salmon, which is used therapeutically, is 10–100 times 
more potent than mammalian forms in lowering serum calcium.

The  circulating  level  of  calcitonin  in  humans  is  lower  than  that  in 
many other species. In humans, even extreme variations in calcitonin 
production do not change calcium and phosphate metabolism; no defi-
nite effects are attributable to calcitonin deficiency (totally thyroidecto-
mized patients receiving only replacement thyroxine) or excess (patients 
with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, a calcitonin-secreting tumor) 
(Chap. 388). Calcitonin has been a useful pharmacologic agent to sup-
press bone resorption in Paget’s disease (Chap. 412) and osteoporosis 
(Chap.  411)  and  in  the  treatment  of  hypercalcemia  of  malignancy 
(see  below).  However,  bisphosphates  are  usually  more  effective,  and 
the physiologic role, if any, of calcitonin in humans is uncertain. On 
the other hand, ablation of the calcitonin gene (combined because of 
the close proximity with ablation of the CGRP gene) in mice leads to 
reduced bone mineral density, suggesting that its biologic role in mam-
mals is still not fully understood.
 ■ HYPERCALCEMIA
Introduction 
(See  also  Chap.  54)  Hypercalcemia  can  be  a  man-
ifestation  of  a  serious  illness  such  as  malignancy  or  can  be  detected 
coincidentally by laboratory testing in a patient with no obvious illness. 
The number of patients recognized with asymptomatic hypercalcemia, 
usually  hyperparathyroidism,  increased  in  the  late  twentieth  century 
when wider testing became readily available.

Whenever hypercalcemia is confirmed, a definitive diagnosis must 
be  established.  Although  hyperparathyroidism,  a  frequent  cause  of 
asymptomatic  hypercalcemia,  is  a  chronic  disorder  in  which  man-
ifestations,  if  any,  may  be  expressed  only  after  months  or  years,

hypercalcemia can also be the earliest manifestation of malignancy, the 
second most common cause of hypercalcemia in the adult. The causes 
of hypercalcemia are numerous (Table 410-1), but hyperparathyroid-
ism and cancer account for 90% of all cases.

Before  undertaking  a  diagnostic  workup,  it  is  essential  to  be  sure 
that true hypercalcemia, not a false-positive laboratory test, is present. 
A  false-positive  diagnosis  of  hypercalcemia  is  usually  the  result  of 
inadvertent  hemoconcentration  during  blood  collection  or  elevation 
in serum proteins such as albumin. Hypercalcemia is in most cases a 
chronic  problem,  and  it  is  cost-effective  to  obtain  several  serum  cal-
cium measurements; these tests need not be in the fasting state.

Clinical features are helpful in differential diagnosis. Hypercalcemia 
in an adult who is asymptomatic is usually due to primary hyperpara-
thyroidism.  In  malignancy-associated  hypercalcemia,  the  disease  is 
usually not occult; rather, symptoms of malignancy bring the patient 
to the physician, and hypercalcemia is discovered during the evalua-
tion. In such patients, the interval between detection of hypercalcemia 
and death, especially without vigorous treatment, is often <6 months. 
Accordingly, if an asymptomatic individual has had hypercalcemia or 
some manifestation of hypercalcemia such as kidney stones for >1 or 
2 years, it is unlikely that malignancy is the cause. Nevertheless, differ-
entiating  primary  hyperparathyroidism  from  occult  malignancy  can 
occasionally be difficult, and careful evaluation is required, particularly 
when the duration of the hypercalcemia is unknown. Hypercalcemia 
not due to hyperparathyroidism or malignancy can result from exces-
sive vitamin D action, impaired metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D, high bone 
turnover  from  any  of  several  causes,  or  renal  failure  (Table  410-1). 
Dietary history and a history of ingestion of vitamins or drugs are often 
helpful in diagnosing some of the less frequent causes. Immunometric 
PTH  assays  serve  as  the  principal  laboratory  test  in  establishing  the 
diagnosis.

Hypercalcemia  from  any  cause  can  result  in  fatigue,  depression, 
mental confusion, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, reversible 
renal  tubular  defects,  increased  urine  output,  a  short  QT  interval  in 
the  electrocardiogram,  and,  in  some  patients,  cardiac  arrhythmias.

There is a variable relation from one patient to the next between the 
severity of hypercalcemia and the symptoms. Generally, symptoms are 
more common at calcium levels >2.9–3.0 mmol/L (11.6–12.0 mg/dL), 
but some patients, even at this level, are asymptomatic. When the cal-
cium level is >3.2 mmol/L (12.8 mg/dL), calcification in kidneys, skin, 
vessels, lungs, heart, and stomach occurs, and renal insufficiency may 
develop, particularly if blood phosphate levels are normal or elevated 
due to impaired renal excretion. Severe hypercalcemia, usually defined 
as ≥3.7–4.5 mmol/L (14.8–18.0 mg/dL), can be a medical emergency; 
coma and cardiac arrest can occur.

Acute management of the hypercalcemia is usually successful. The 
type of treatment is based on the severity of the hypercalcemia and the 
nature of associated symptoms, as outlined below.

 ■ PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM
Pathophysiology 
•	 NATURAL  HISTORY  AND  INCIDENCe  Pri-
mary hyperparathyroidism is a generalized disorder of calcium, phos-
phate,  and  bone  metabolism  due  to  an  increased  secretion  of  PTH. 
The  elevation  of  circulating  hormone  usually  leads  to  hypercalcemia 
and hypophosphatemia. There is great variation in the manifestations. 
Patients  may  present  with  multiple  signs  and  symptoms,  including 
recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less fre-
quently,  extensive  bone  resorption.  However,  with  greater  awareness 
of the disease and wider use of multiphasic screening tests, including 
measurements  of  blood  calcium,  the  diagnosis  is  frequently  made  in 
patients who have no symptoms and minimal, if any, signs of the dis-
ease other than hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH. The man-
ifestations  may  be  subtle,  and  the  disease  may  have  a  benign  course 
for many years or a lifetime. This milder form of the disease is usually 
termed asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. Rarely, hyperparathyroid-
ism develops or worsens abruptly and causes severe complications such 
as marked dehydration and coma, so-called hypercalcemic parathyroid 
crisis.

The  annual  incidence  of  the  disease  is  calculated  to  be  as  high  as 
0.2% in patients >60 years old, with an estimated prevalence, including 
undiscovered asymptomatic patients, of ≥1%; some reports suggest the 
incidence  may  be  declining.  If  confirmed,  these  changing  estimates 
may  reflect  less  frequent  routine  testing  of  serum  calcium  in  recent 
years,  earlier  overestimates  in  incidence,  or  unknown  factors.  The 
disease has a peak incidence between the third and fifth decades but 
occurs in young children and the elderly.
ETIOLOGY  Parathyroid  tumors  are  most  often  encountered  as  iso-
lated adenomas without other endocrinopathy. They may also arise in 
hereditary  syndromes  such  as  MEN  syndromes.  As  many  as  10%  of 
patients with hyperparathyroidism are found to have mutations in 1 of 
11 genes (see below). Parathyroid tumors may also arise as secondary 
to underlying disease (excessive stimulation in secondary hyperpara-
thyroidism,  especially  chronic  renal  failure),  or  after  other  forms  of 
excessive  stimulation  such  as  lithium  therapy.  These  etiologies  are 
discussed below.
Solitary  Adenomas  A  single  abnormal  gland  is  the  cause  in  ~80%  of 
patients;  the  abnormality  in  the  gland  is  usually  a  benign  neoplasm 
or adenoma and rarely a parathyroid carcinoma. Some surgeons and 
pathologists report that the enlargement of multiple glands is common; 
double  adenomas  are  reported.  In  ~15%  of  patients,  all  glands  are 
hyperfunctioning;  chief  cell  parathyroid  hyperplasia  is  usually  hered-
itary and frequently associated with other endocrine abnormalities.
Hereditary  Syndromes  and  Multiple  Parathyroid  Tumors  Hereditary  hyperpara-
thyroidism  can  occur  without  other  endocrine  abnormalities  but  is 
usually part of a MEN syndrome (Chap. 388). MEN 1 (Wermer’s syn-
drome)  consists  of  hyperparathyroidism  and  tumors  of  the  pituitary 
and pancreas, often associated with gastric hypersecretion and peptic 
ulcer disease (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). MEN 2A is characterized 
by  pheochromocytoma  and  medullary  carcinoma  of  the  thyroid, 
as  well  as  hyperparathyroidism;  MEN  2B  has  additional  associated 
features  such  as  multiple  neuromas  but  usually  lacks  hyperparathy-
roidism. Each of these MEN syndromes is transmitted in an apparent

3174 autosomal  dominant  manner,  although,  as  noted  below,  the  genetic 

basis of MEN 1 involves biallelic loss of a tumor suppressor.

The hyperparathyroidism jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome occurs in 
families  with  parathyroid  tumors  (sometimes  carcinomas)  in  associ-
ation  with  benign  jaw  tumors.  This  disorder  is  caused  by  mutations 
in  CDC73  (HRPT2),  and  mutations  in  this  gene  are  also  observed 
in  sporadic  parathyroid  cancers.  Some  kindreds  exhibit  hereditary 
hyperparathyroidism without other endocrinopathies, which has been 
referred  to  as  nonsyndromic  familial  isolated  hyperparathyroidism 
(FIHP). In some of these familial cases, the disease co-segregated with 
heterozygous mutations in GCM2. Inactivating or activating mutations 
in this parathyroid-specific transcription factor had initially been iden-
tified in familial forms of hypoparathyroidism. However, identification 
of a GCM2 mutation in a parathyroid adenoma raised the possibility 
that mutations in this gene could also be causing some forms of FIHP. 
Furthermore, there is speculation that some FIHP cases may be exam-
ples  of  variable  expression  of  the  other  syndromes  such  as  MEN  1, 
MEN 2, or the HPT-JT syndrome, but they may also have distinctive, 
still unidentified genetic causes.

Genetic  Defects  Associated  with  Hyperparathyroidism  As 
in  many  other  types  of  neoplasia,  two  fundamental  types  of  genetic 
defects have been identified in parathyroid gland tumors: (1) overac-
tivity of protooncogenes and (2) loss of function of tumor-suppressor 
genes.  The  former,  by  definition,  can  lead  to  uncontrolled  cellular 
growth  and  function  by  activation  (gain-of-function  mutation)  of  a 
single  allele  of  the  responsible  gene,  whereas  the  latter  requires  loss 
of function of both allelic copies. Biallelic loss of function of a tumor-
suppressor gene is usually characterized by a germline defect (all cells) 
and an additional somatic deletion/mutation in the tumor (Fig. 410-3).
Mutations in the MEN1 gene locus, encoding the protein MENIN, 
on chromosome 11q13 are responsible for causing MEN 1; the normal 
allele of this gene fits the definition of a tumor-suppressor gene. Inher-
itance of one mutated allele in this hereditary syndrome, followed by 

loss of the other allele via somatic cell mutation, leads to monoclonal 
expansion  and  tumor  development.  Also,  in  ~15–20%  of  sporadic 
parathyroid adenomas, both alleles of the MEN1 locus on chromosome 
11 are somatically deleted, implying that the same defect responsible 
for  MEN  1  can  also  cause  the  sporadic  disease  (Fig.  410-3A).  Con-
sistent with the Knudson hypothesis for two-step neoplasia in certain 
inherited cancer syndromes (Chap. 71), the earlier onset of hyperpara-
thyroidism in the hereditary syndromes reflects the need for only one 
mutational  event  to  trigger  the  monoclonal  outgrowth.  In  sporadic 
adenomas, typically occurring later in life, two different somatic events 
must occur before the MEN1 gene is silenced.

Other  presumptive  anti-oncogenes  involved  in  hyperparathyroid-
ism include a still unidentified gene mapped to chromosome 1p seen 
in 40% of sporadic parathyroid adenomas and a gene mapped to chro-
mosome  Xp11  in  patients  with  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  and 
renal failure, who progressed to “tertiary” hyperparathyroidism, now 
known to reflect monoclonal outgrowths within previously hyperplas-
tic glands.

A  more  complex  pattern,  still  incompletely  resolved,  arises  with 
genetic  defects  and  carcinoma  of  the  parathyroids.  This  appears  to 
be  due  to  biallelic  loss  of  a  functioning  copy  of  a  gene,  HRPT2  (or 
CDC73),  originally  identified  as  the  cause  of  the  HPT-JT  syndrome. 
Several inactivating mutations have been identified in HRPT2 (located 
on  chromosome  1q21-31),  which  encodes  a  531-amino-acid  protein 
called parafibromin. The responsible genetic mutations in HRPT2 (or 
another gene) appear to be necessary, but not sufficient, for parathyroid 
cancer.

In  general,  the  detection  of  additional  genetic  defects  in  these 
parathyroid tumor–related syndromes and the variations seen in phe-
notypic expression/penetrance indicate the multiplicity of the genetic 
factors  responsible.  Nonetheless,  the  ability  to  detect  the  presence 
of  the  major  genetic  contributors  has  greatly  aided  a  more  informed 
management of family members of patients identified in the hereditary 
syndromes such as MEN 1, MEN 2, and HPT-JT.

two successive somatic mutations must occur, a process that takes a longer time. By either pathway, the cell, deprived of growth-regulating influence from this gene, 
has unregulated growth and becomes a tumor. A different genetic locus also involving loss of a tumor-suppressor gene termed HRPT2 is involved in the pathogenesis 
of  parathyroid  carcinoma.  B.  Schematic  illustration  of  the  mechanism  and  consequences  of  gene  rearrangement  and  overexpression  of  the  PRAD1  protooncogene

An  important  contribution  from  studies  on  the  genetic  origin  of 
parathyroid  carcinoma  has  been  the  realization  that  the  mutations 
involve a different pathway than that involved with the benign gland 
enlargements.  Unlike  the  pathogenesis  of  genetic  alterations  seen  in 
colon cancer, where lesions evolve from benign adenomas to malignant 
disease by progressive genetic changes, the alterations commonly seen 
in most parathyroid cancers (HRPT2 mutations) are infrequently seen 
in sporadic parathyroid adenomas.

Abnormalities at the Rb gene were the first to be noted in parathy-
roid cancer. The Rb gene, a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromo-
some 13q14, was initially associated with retinoblastoma but has since 
been implicated in other neoplasias, including parathyroid carcinoma. 
Early studies implicated allelic deletions of the Rb gene in many para-
thyroid carcinomas and decreased or absent expression of the Rb pro-
tein. However, because there are often large deletions in chromosome 
13 that include many genes in addition to the Rb locus (with similar 
findings in some pituitary carcinomas), it remains possible that other 
tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome 13 may be playing a role in 
parathyroid carcinoma.

Study  of  the  parathyroid  cancers  found  in  some  patients  with  the 
HPT-JT  syndrome  has  led  to  identification  of  a  much  larger  role  for 
mutations in the HRPT2 gene in most parathyroid carcinomas, includ-
ing those that arise sporadically, without apparent association with the 
HPT-JT syndrome. Mutations in the coding region have been identi-
fied in 75–80% of all parathyroid cancers analyzed, leading to the con-
clusion  that,  with  addition  of  presumed  mutations  in  the  noncoding 
regions, this genetic defect may be seen in essentially all parathyroid 
carcinomas.  Of  special  importance  was  the  discovery  that,  in  some 
sporadic  parathyroid  cancers,  germline  mutations  have  been  found; 
this,  in  turn,  has  led  to  careful  investigation  of  the  families  of  these 
patients and a new clinical indication for genetic testing in this setting.
Hypercalcemia  occurring  in  family  members  (who  are  also  found 
to have the germline mutations) can lead to the finding, at parathyroid 
surgery, of premalignant parathyroid tumors.

Overall,  it  seems  there  are  multiple  factors  in  parathyroid  cancer, 
in  addition  to  the  HRPT2  and  Rb  gene,  although  the  HRPT2  gene 
mutation  is  the  most  invariant  abnormality.  RET  encodes  a  tyrosine 
kinase  type  receptor;  specific  inherited  germline  mutations  lead  to  a 
constitutive activation of the receptor, thereby explaining the autoso-
mal dominant mode of transmission and the relatively early onset of 
neoplasia.  In  the  MEN  2  syndrome,  the  RET  protooncogene  may  be 
responsible for the earliest disorder detected, the polyclonal disorder 
(C-cell  hyperplasia,  which  then  is  transformed  into  a  clonal  out-
growth—a  medullary  carcinoma  with  the  participation  of  other,  still 
uncharacterized genetic defects).

In some parathyroid adenomas, activation of a protooncogene has 
been  identified  (Fig.  410-3B).  A  reciprocal  translocation  involving 
chromosome  11  has  been  identified  that  juxtaposes  the  PTH  gene 
promoter upstream of CCND1, encoding a cyclin D protein that plays 
a key role in normal cell division. This translocation plus other mech-
anisms that cause an equivalent overexpression of cyclin D1 are found 
in 20–40% of parathyroid adenomas.

Mouse models have confirmed the role of several of the major iden-
tified genetic defects in parathyroid disease and the MEN syndromes. 
Loss of the MEN1 gene locus and overexpression of the CCND1 pro-
tooncogene or the mutated RET protooncogene have been analyzed by 
genetic manipulation in mice, with the expected onset of parathyroid 
tumors or medullary carcinoma, respectively.

Pathology  Adenomas are most often located in the inferior para-
thyroid glands, but in 6–10% of patients, parathyroid adenomas may 
be located in the thymus, the thyroid, the pericardium, or behind the 
esophagus. Adenomas are usually 0.5–5 g in size but may be as large as 
10–20 g (normal glands weigh 25 mg on average). Chief cells are pre-
dominant in both hyperplasia and adenoma. With chief cell hyperpla-
sia, the enlargement may be so asymmetric that some involved glands 
appear grossly normal. If generalized hyperplasia is present, however, 
histologic  examination  reveals  a  uniform  pattern  of  chief  cells  and 
disappearance of fat even in the absence of an increase in gland weight. 

Thus, microscopic examination of biopsy specimens of several glands 
is essential to interpret findings at surgery.

Parathyroid carcinoma is often not aggressive. Long-term survival 
without  recurrence  is  common  if  at  initial  surgery  the  entire  gland 
is  removed  without  rupture  of  the  capsule.  Recurrent  parathyroid 
carcinoma is usually slow growing with local spread in the neck, and 
surgical  correction  of  recurrent  disease  may  be  feasible.  Occasion-
ally, however, parathyroid carcinoma is more aggressive, with distant 
metastases (lung, liver, and bone) found at the time of initial operation. 
It may be difficult to appreciate initially that a primary tumor is carci-
noma; increased numbers of mitotic figures and increased fibrosis of 
the  gland  stroma  may  precede  invasion.  The  diagnosis  of  carcinoma 
is often made in retrospect. Hyperparathyroidism from a parathyroid 
carcinoma  may  be  indistinguishable  from  other  forms  of  primary 
hyperparathyroidism but is usually more severe clinically. A potential 
clue to the diagnosis is offered by the degree of calcium elevation. Cal-
cium values of 3.5–3.7 mmol/L (14–15 mg/dL) are frequent with car-
cinoma and may alert the surgeon to remove the abnormal gland with 
care to avoid capsular rupture. Recent findings concerning the genetic 
basis of some patients with parathyroid carcinoma (distinct from that 
of benign adenomas) indicate the need, in these kindreds, for family 
screening (see below).

Signs  and  Symptoms  Many  patients  with  hyperparathyroidism 
are asymptomatic. Manifestations of hyperparathyroidism involve pri-
marily the kidneys and the skeletal system. Kidney involvement, due 
either to deposition of calcium in the renal parenchyma or to recurrent 
nephrolithiasis, was present in 60–70% of patients prior to 1970. With 
earlier  detection,  renal  complications  occur  in  <20%  of  patients  in 
many large series. Renal stones are usually composed of either calcium 
oxalate or calcium phosphate. In occasional patients, repeated episodes 
of nephrolithiasis or the formation of large calculi may lead to urinary 
tract obstruction, infection, and loss of renal function. Nephrocalcino-
sis may also cause decreased renal function and phosphate retention.

The  distinctive  bone  manifestation  of  hyperparathyroidism  is 
osteitis fibrosa cystica, which occurred in 10–25% of patients in series 
reported 50 years ago. Histologically, the pathognomonic features are 
an increase in the giant multinucleated osteoclasts in scalloped areas on 
the surface of the bone (Howship’s lacunae) and a replacement of the 
normal cellular and marrow elements by fibrous tissue. X-ray changes 
include resorption of the phalangeal tufts and replacement of the usu-
ally sharp cortical outline of the bone in the digits by an irregular out-
line (subperiosteal resorption). In recent years, osteitis fibrosa cystica is 
very rare in primary hyperparathyroidism, probably due to the earlier 
detection of the disease.

Dual-energy  x-ray  absorptiometry  of  the  spine  provides  repro-
ducible  quantitative  estimates  (within  a  few  percent)  of  spinal  bone 
density.  Similarly,  bone  density  in  the  extremities  can  be  quantified 
by densitometry of the hip or of the distal radius at a site chosen to be 
primarily cortical. CT is a very sensitive technique for estimating spinal 
bone density, but reproducibility of standard CT is no better than 5%. 
Newer CT techniques (spiral, “extreme” CT) are more reproducible but 
are currently available in a limited number of medical centers. Cortical 
bone density is reduced, while cancellous bone density, especially in the 
spine, is relatively preserved.

In symptomatic patients, dysfunctions of the central nervous system 
(CNS), peripheral nerve and muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and joints 
also occur. It has been reported that severe neuropsychiatric manifes-
tations may be reversed by parathyroidectomy. When present in symp-
tomatic patients, neuromuscular manifestations may include proximal 
muscle weakness, easy fatigability, and atrophy of muscles and may be 
so striking as to suggest a primary neuromuscular disorder. The distin-
guishing feature is the complete regression of neuromuscular disease 
after surgical correction of the hyperparathyroidism.

Gastrointestinal  manifestations  are  sometimes  subtle  and  include 
vague  abdominal  complaints  and  disorders  of  the  stomach  and  pan-
creas.  Again,  cause  and  effect  are  unclear.  In  MEN  1  patients  with 
hyperparathyroidism,  duodenal  ulcer  may  be  the  result  of  associ-
ated  pancreatic  tumors  that  secrete  excessive  quantities  of  gastrin

3176 (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Pancreatitis has been reported in associ-
ation with hyperparathyroidism, but the incidence and the mechanism 
are not established.

Much attention has been paid in recent years to the manifestations 
of and optimum management strategies for asymptomatic hyperpara-
thyroidism. This is now the most prevalent form of the disease. Asymp-
tomatic  primary  hyperparathyroidism  is  defined  as  biochemically 
confirmed  hyperparathyroidism  (elevated  or  inappropriately  normal 
PTH levels despite hypercalcemia) with the absence of signs and symp-
toms typically associated with more severe hyperparathyroidism such 
as features of renal or bone disease.

Four  conferences  on  the  topic  have  been  held  in  the  United  States 
over the past two decades, with the most recent in 2014. The published 
proceedings include discussion of more subtle manifestations of disease, 
its natural history (without parathyroidectomy), and guidelines both for 
indications for surgery and medical monitoring in nonoperated patients.
Issues  of  concern  include  the  potential  for  cardiovascular  deteri-
oration,  the  presence  of  subtle  neuropsychiatric  symptoms,  and  the 
longer-term status of skeletal integrity in patients not treated surgically. 
The current consensus is that medical monitoring rather than surgical 
correction of hyperparathyroidism may be justified in certain patients. 
The current recommendation is that patients who show mild disease, 
as defined by the meeting guidelines (Table 410-2), can be safely fol-
lowed under management guidelines (Table 410-3). There is, however, 
growing uncertainty about subtle disease manifestations and whether 
surgery is therefore indicated in most patients. Among the issues is the 
evidence of eventual (>8 years) deterioration in bone mineral density 
after a decade of relative stability. There is concern that this late-onset 
deterioration in bone density in nonoperated patients could contribute 
significantly to the well-known age-dependent fracture risk (osteopo-
rosis). Significant and sustained improvements in bone mineral density 
are seen after successful parathyroidectomy, and there is some evidence 
for reduction in fractures.

Cardiovascular disease including left ventricular hypertrophy, car-
diac functional defects, and endothelial dysfunction have been reported 
as reversible in European patients with more severe symptomatic dis-
ease after surgery, leading to numerous studies of these cardiovascular 
features in those with milder disease. There are reports of endothelial 
dysfunction in patients with mild asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism, 
but the expert panels concluded that more observation is needed, espe-
cially regarding whether there is reversibility with surgery.

A  topic  of  considerable  interest  and  some  debate  is  assessment 
of  neuropsychiatric  status  and  health-related  quality  of  life  status 
in  hyperparathyroid  patients  both  before  surgery  and  in  response 
to  parathyroidectomy.  Several  observational  studies  have  suggested 
improvements  in  symptom  score  after  surgery.  Randomized  studies 
of  surgery  versus  observation,  however,  have  yielded  inconclusive

results,  especially  regarding  benefits  of  surgery.  Many  studies  report 
that hyperparathyroidism is associated with increased neuropsychiatric 
symptoms, but it is not possible at present to determine which patients 
might improve after surgery.

Diagnosis  The diagnosis is typically made by detecting an elevated 
immunoreactive PTH level in a patient with asymptomatic hypercal-
cemia (Fig. 410-4) (see “Differential Diagnosis: Special Tests,” below). 
Serum phosphate is usually low but may be normal, especially if renal 
failure has developed.

Several  modifications  in  PTH  assays  have  been  introduced  in 
efforts to improve their utility in light of information about metabo-
lism of PTH (as discussed above). First-generation assays were based 
on  displacement  of  radiolabeled  PTH  from  antibodies  that  reacted 
with  PTH  (often  also  PTH  fragments).  Double-antibody  or  immu-
nometric  assays  (one  antibody  that  is  usually  directed  against  the

against  the  amino-terminal  portion  of  intact  PTH)  greatly  improved 
the  diagnostic  discrimination  of  the  tests  by  eliminating  interference 
from circulating biologically inactive fragments, detected by the orig-
inal  first-generation  assays.  Double-antibody  assays  are  now  referred 
to as second-generation. Such PTH assays have, in some centers and 
testing  laboratories,  been  replaced  by  third-generation  assays  after  it 
was discovered that large PTH fragments, devoid of only the extreme 
amino-terminal  portion  of  the  PTH  molecule,  are  also  present  in 
blood and are detected, incorrectly as full-length PTH. These amino- 
terminally truncated PTH fragments were prevented from registering 
in  the  newer  third-generation  assays  by  use  of  a  detection  antibody 
directed  against  the  extreme  amino-terminal  epitope.  These  assays 
may be useful for clinical research studies as in management of chronic 
renal disease, but the consensus is that either second- or third-genera-
tion assays are useful in the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism 
and for the diagnosis of high-turnover bone disease in CKD.

TREATMENT
Hyperparathyroidism

Surgical excision of the abnormal parathyroid tissue is the defini-
tive therapy for this disease. As noted above, medical surveillance 
without  operation  for  patients  with  mild,  asymptomatic  disease 
is,  however,  still  preferred  by  some  physicians  and  patients,  par-
ticularly  when  the  patients  are  more  elderly.  Evidence  favoring 
surgery, if medically feasible, is growing because of concerns about 
skeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric disease, even in mild 
hyperparathyroidism.

Two  surgical  approaches  are  generally  practiced.  The  conven-
tional  parathyroidectomy  procedure  was  neck  exploration  with 
general anesthesia; this procedure is being replaced in many cen-
ters, whenever feasible, by an outpatient procedure with local anes-
thesia, termed minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.

Parathyroid exploration is challenging and should be undertaken 
by an experienced surgeon. Certain features help in predicting the 
pathology (e.g., multiple abnormal glands in familial cases). How-
ever,  some  critical  decisions  regarding  management  can  be  made 
only during the operation.

With  conventional  surgery,  one  approach  is  still  based  on  the 
view that typically only one gland (the adenoma) is abnormal. If an 
enlarged gland is found, a normal gland should be sought. In this 
view, if a biopsy of a normal-sized second gland confirms its histo-
logic (and presumed functional) normality, no further exploration, 
biopsy, or excision is needed. At the other extreme is the minority 
viewpoint that all four glands be sought and that most of the total 
parathyroid tissue mass be removed. The concern with the former 
approach is that the recurrence rate of hyperparathyroidism may be 
high if a second abnormal gland is missed; the latter approach could 
involve unnecessary surgery and an unacceptable rate of hypopara-
thyroidism. When normal glands are found in association with one 
enlarged gland, excision of the single adenoma usually leads to cure 
or at least years free of symptoms. Long-term follow-up studies to 
establish true rates of recurrence are limited.

Recently, there has been growing experience with new surgical 
strategies  that  feature  a  minimally  invasive  approach  guided  by 
improved preoperative localization and intraoperative monitoring 
by  PTH  assays.  Preoperative  99mTc  sestamibi  scans  with  single- 
photon emission CT (SPECT) are used to predict the location of an 
abnormal gland and intraoperative sampling of PTH before and at 
5-min intervals after removal of a suspected adenoma to confirm a 
rapid fall (>50%) to normal levels of PTH. In several centers, a com-
bination of preoperative four-dimensional (4D) CT and ultrasound 
examination and, less frequently, sestamibi imaging, cervical block 
anesthesia, minimal surgical incision, and intraoperative PTH mea-
surements has allowed successful outpatient surgical management 
with  a  clear-cut  cost  benefit  compared  to  general  anesthesia  and 
more extensive neck surgery. The use of these minimally invasive

approaches requires clinical judgment to select patients unlikely to 
have multiple-gland disease (e.g., MEN or secondary hyperparathy-
roidism). The growing acceptance of the technique and its relative 
ease for the patient has lowered the threshold for surgery.

Severe  hypercalcemia  may  provide  a  preoperative  clue  to  the 
presence  of  parathyroid  carcinoma.  In  such  cases,  when  neck 
exploration is undertaken, the tissue should be widely excised; care 
is taken to avoid rupture of the capsule to prevent local seeding of 
tumor cells.

Multiple-gland hyperplasia, as predicted in familial cases, poses 
more difficult questions of surgical management. Once a diagnosis 
of hyperplasia is established, all the glands must be identified. Two 
schemes  have  been  proposed  for  surgical  management.  One  is  to 
totally remove three glands with partial excision of the fourth gland; 
care is taken to leave a good blood supply for the remaining gland. 
Other surgeons advocate total parathyroidectomy with immediate 
transplantation  of  a  portion  of  a  removed,  minced  parathyroid 
gland into the muscles of the forearm, with the view that surgical 
excision is easier from the ectopic site in the arm if there is recur-
rent hyperfunction.

In  a  minority  of  cases,  if  no  abnormal  parathyroid  glands  are 
found in the neck, the issue of further exploration must be decided. 
There are documented cases of five or six parathyroid glands and of 
unusual locations for adenomas such as in the mediastinum.

When  a  second  parathyroid  exploration  is  indicated,  the  min-
imally  invasive  techniques  for  preoperative  localization  such  as 
ultrasound,  CT  scan,  and  isotope  scanning  are  combined  with 
venous  sampling  and/or  selective  digital  arteriography  in  one  of 
the  centers  specializing  in  these  procedures.  Intraoperative  mon-
itoring of PTH levels by rapid PTH immunoassays may be useful 
in  guiding  the  surgery.  At  one  center,  long-term  cures  have  been 
achieved with selective embolization or injection of large amounts 
of  contrast  material  into  the  end-arterial  circulation  feeding  the 
parathyroid tumor.

A  decline  in  serum  calcium  occurs  within  24  h  after  success-
ful  surgery;  usually,  blood  calcium  falls  to  low-normal  values  for   
3–5 days until the remaining parathyroid tissue resumes full hor-
mone secretion. Acute postoperative hypocalcemia is likely only if 
severe bone mineral deficits are present or if injury to all the normal 
parathyroid glands occurs during surgery. In general, there are few 
problems encountered in patients with uncomplicated disease such 
as a single adenoma (the clear majority), who do not have symp-
tomatic  bone  disease  or  a  large  deficit  in  bone  mineral,  who  are 
vitamin D and magnesium sufficient, and who have good renal and 
gastrointestinal function. The extent of postoperative hypocalcemia 
varies with the surgical approach. If all glands are biopsied, hypoc-
alcemia  may  be  transiently  symptomatic  and  more  prolonged. 
Hypocalcemia is more likely to be symptomatic after second para-
thyroid explorations, particularly when normal parathyroid tissue 
was  removed  at  the  initial  operation  and  when  the  manipulation 
and/or biopsy of the remaining normal glands are more extensive 
in the search for the missing adenoma.

Patients  with  hyperparathyroidism  have  efficient  intestinal 
calcium  absorption  due  to  the  increased  levels  of  1,25(OH)2D 
stimulated  by  PTH  excess.  Once  hypocalcemia  signifies  success-
ful  surgery,  patients  can  be  put  on  a  high-calcium  intake  or  be 
given oral calcium supplements. Despite mild hypocalcemia, most 
patients do not require parenteral therapy. If the serum calcium falls 
to <2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL), and if the phosphate level rises simultane-
ously,  the  possibility  that  surgery  has  caused  hypoparathyroidism 
must  be  considered.  With  unexpected  hypocalcemia,  coexistent 
hypomagnesemia  should  be  considered,  as  it  interferes  with  PTH 
secretion and causes functional hypoparathyroidism (Chap. 409).
Signs of hypocalcemia include symptoms such as muscle twitch-
ing, a general sense of anxiety, and positive Chvostek’s and Trous-
seau’s  signs  coupled  with  serum  calcium  consistently  <2  mmol/L 
(8 mg/dL). Parenteral calcium replacement at a low level should be 
instituted when hypocalcemia is symptomatic. The rate and dura-
tion of IV therapy are determined by the severity of the symptoms

and the response of the serum calcium to treatment. An infusion 
of 0.5–2 mg/kg per hour or 30–100 mL/h of a 1-mg/mL solution 
usually suffices to relieve symptoms. Usually, parenteral therapy is 
required for only a few days. If symptoms worsen or if parenteral 
calcium  is  needed  for  >2–3  days,  therapy  with  a  vitamin  D  ana-
logue and/or oral calcium (2–4 g/d) should be started (see below). 
It  is  cost-effective  to  use  calcitriol  (doses  of  0.5–1  μg/d)  because 
of  the  rapidity  of  onset  of  effect  and  prompt  cessation  of  action 
when stopped, in comparison to other forms of vitamin D. A rise 
in  blood  calcium  after  several  months  of  vitamin  D  replacement 
may  indicate  restoration  of  parathyroid  function  to  normal.  It  is 
also appropriate to monitor serum PTH serially to estimate gland 
function in such patients.

If  magnesium  deficiency  is  present,  it  can  complicate  the  post-
operative course since magnesium deficiency impairs the secretion 
of PTH. Hypomagnesemia should be corrected whenever detected. 
Magnesium replacement can be effective orally (e.g., MgCl2, MgOH2), 
but parenteral repletion is usual to ensure postoperative recovery, if 
magnesium  deficiency  is  suspected  due  to  low  blood  magnesium 
levels.  Because  the  depressant  effect  of  magnesium  on  central  and 
peripheral  nerve  functions  does  not  occur  at  levels  <2  mmol/L 
(normal  range  0.8–1.2  mmol/L),  parenteral  replacement  can  be 
given rapidly. A cumulative dose as great as 0.5–1 mmol/kg of body 
weight  can  be  administered  if  severe  hypomagnesemia  is  present; 
often, however, total doses of 20–40 mmol are sufficient. 

MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The guidelines for recommending surgical intervention, if feasible 
(Table 410-2), as well as for monitoring patients with asymptomatic 
hyperparathyroidism  who  elect  not  to  undergo  parathyroidec-
tomy  (Table  410-3),  reflect  the  changes  over  time  since  the  first 
conference  on  the  topic  in  1990.  Medical  monitoring  rather  than 
corrective  surgery  is  still  acceptable,  but  it  is  clear  that  surgical 
intervention  is  the  more  frequently  recommended  option  for  the 
reasons noted above. Tightened guidelines favoring surgery include 
lowering the recommended level of serum calcium elevation, more 
careful  attention  to  skeletal  integrity  through  reference  to  peak 
skeletal mass at baseline (T scores) rather than age-adjusted bone 
density (Z scores), as well as the presence of any fragility fracture. 
The other changes noted in the two guidelines (Tables 410-2 and 
410-3) reflect accumulated experience and practical consideration, 
such as a difficulty in quantity of urine collections. Despite the use-
fulness of the guidelines, the importance of individual patient and 
physician judgment and preference is clear in all recommendations.
When surgery is not selected or not medically feasible, there is 
interest in the potential value of specific medical therapies. There 
is  no  long-term  experience  regarding  specific  clinical  outcomes 
such  as  fracture  prevention,  but  it  has  been  established  that  bis-
phosphonates  increase  bone  mineral  density  significantly  without 
changing  serum  calcium  (as  does  estrogen,  but  the  latter  is  not 
favored because of reported adverse effects in other organ systems). 
Calcimimetics that lower PTH secretion lower calcium but do not 
affect bone mineral density (BMD).

 ■ OTHER PARATHYROID CAUSES OF 
HYPERCALCEMIA
Lithium  Therapy  Lithium,  used  in  the  management  of  bipolar 
depression  and  other  psychiatric  disorders,  causes  hypercalcemia  in 
~10%  of  treated  patients.  The  hypercalcemia  is  dependent  on  con-
tinued  lithium  treatment,  remitting  and  recurring  when  lithium  is 
stopped  and  restarted.  The  parathyroid  adenomas  reported  in  some 
hypercalcemic patients with lithium therapy may reflect the presence 
of an independently occurring parathyroid tumor; a permanent effect 
of  lithium  on  parathyroid  gland  growth  need  not  be  implicated  as 
most patients have complete reversal of hypercalcemia when lithium is 
stopped. However, long-standing stimulation of parathyroid cell rep-
lication  by  lithium  may  predispose  to  development  of  adenomas  (as 
is documented in secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal failure).

At  the  levels  achieved  in  blood  in  treated  patients,  lithium  can  be 
shown in vitro to shift the PTH secretion curve to the right in response 
to calcium; i.e., higher calcium levels are required to lower PTH secre-
tion, probably acting at the calcium sensor (see below). This effect can 
cause elevated PTH levels and consequent hypercalcemia in otherwise 
normal individuals. Fortunately, there are usually alternative medica-
tions for the underlying psychiatric illness. Parathyroid surgery should 
not  be  recommended  unless  hypercalcemia  and  elevated  PTH  levels 
persist after lithium is discontinued.

 ■ GENETIC DISORDERS CAUSING 
HYPERPARATHYROIDISM-LIKE SYNDROMES
Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia  FHH (also called famil-
ial benign hypercalcemia) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. 
Affected  individuals  are  discovered  because  of  asymptomatic  hyper-
calcemia.  Most  cases  of  FHH  (FHH1)  are  caused  by  an  inactivating 
mutation in a single allele of the CaSR (see below), leading to inappro-
priately normal or even increased secretion of PTH, whereas another 
hypercalcemic disorder, namely the exceedingly rare Jansen’s disease, is 
caused by a constitutively active PTH/PTHrP receptor in target tissues. 
Neither FHH1 nor Jansen’s disease, however, is a growth disorder of the 
parathyroids. Other forms of FHH are caused either by heterozygous 
mutations in GNA11 (encoding Gα11), one of the signaling proteins at 
the CaSR (FHH2), or by heterozygous mutations in AP1A1 (FHH3).

The  pathophysiology  of  FHH1  is  now  understood.  The  primary 
defect  is  abnormal  sensing  of  the  blood  calcium  by  the  parathyroid 
gland  and  renal  tubule,  causing  inappropriate  secretion  of  PTH  and 
excessive  reabsorption  of  calcium  in  the  distal  renal  tubules.  The 
CaSR is a member of the third family of GPCRs (type C or type III). 
The  receptor  responds  to  increased  ECF  calcium  concentration  by 
suppressing  PTH  secretion  through  second-messenger  signaling  at 
the  CaSR  involving  the  G  proteins,  Gα11  and  Gαq,  thereby  provid-
ing  negative-feedback  regulation  of  PTH  secretion.  Many  different  
inactivating  CaSR  mutations  have  been  identified  in  patients  with 
FHH1.  These  mutations  lower  the  capacity  of  the  sensor  to  bind 
calcium, and the mutant receptors function as though blood calcium 
levels were low; excessive secretion of PTH occurs from an otherwise 
normal  gland.  Approximately  two-thirds  of  patients  with  FHH  have 
mutations  within  the  protein-coding  region  of  the  CaSR  gene.  The 
remaining one-third of kindreds may have mutations in the promoter/
introns of the CaSR gene or are caused by mutations in other genes.

Even before elucidation of the pathophysiology of FHH, abundant 
clinical evidence served to separate the disorder from primary hyper-
parathyroidism;  these  clinical  features  are  still  useful  in  differential 
diagnosis. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have <99% renal 
calcium  reabsorption,  whereas  most  patients  with  FHH  have  >99% 
reabsorption. The hypercalcemia in FHH is often detectable in affected 
members of the kindreds in the first decade of life, whereas hypercalce-
mia rarely occurs in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism or the 
MEN syndromes who are aged <10 years. PTH may be elevated in the 
different forms of FHH, but the values are usually normal or lower for 
the same degree of calcium elevation than is observed in patients with 
primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid surgery performed in a few 
patients with FHH before the nature of the syndrome was understood 
led  to  permanent  hypoparathyroidism;  nevertheless,  hypocalciuria 
persisted, establishing that hypocalciuria is not PTH-dependent (now 
known to be due to the abnormal CaSR in the kidney).

Few clinical signs or symptoms are present in patients with FHH, 
while other endocrine abnormalities are not. Most patients are detected 
as  a  result  of  family  screening  after  hypercalcemia  is  detected  in  a 
proband.  In  those  patients  inadvertently  operated  upon  for  primary 
hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroids appeared normal or moderately 
hyperplastic.  Parathyroid  surgery  is  not  appropriate,  nor,  in  view  of 
the lack of symptoms, does medical treatment seem needed to lower 
the  calcium.  One  striking  exception  to  the  rule  against  parathyroid 
surgery in this syndrome is the occurrence, usually in consanguineous 
marriages (due to the rarity of the gene mutation), of a homozygous 
or  compound  heterozygote  state,  resulting  in  severe  impairment  of

CaSR function. In this condition, neonatal severe hypercalcemia, total 
parathyroidectomy  is  mandatory,  but  calcimimetics  have  been  used 
as a temporary measure. Rare but well-documented cases of acquired 
hypocalciuric hypercalcemia are reported due to antibodies against the 
CaSR. They appear to be a complication of an underlying autoimmune 
disorder  and  respond  to  therapies  directed  against  the  underlying 
disorder.

Jansen’s Disease  Activating mutations in the PTH/PTHrP recep-
tor (PTHR1) have been identified as the cause of this rare autosomal 
dominant syndrome. Because the mutations lead to constitutive acti-
vation of receptor function, one abnormal copy of the mutant receptor 
is sufficient to cause the disease, thereby accounting for its dominant 
mode  of  transmission.  Besides  often  severe  hypercalcemia,  patients 
affected by Jansen’s disease have short-limbed dwarfism due to abnor-
mal regulation of chondrocyte maturation in the growth plates of the 
bone that are formed through the endochondral process. In adult life, 
there  are  numerous  abnormalities  in  bone,  including  multiple  cystic 
resorptive areas resembling those seen in severe hyperparathyroidism. 
Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia with undetectable or low PTH 
levels  are  typically  observed.  The  pathogenesis  of  the  growth  plate 
abnormalities  in  Jansen’s  disease  has  been  confirmed  by  transgenic 
experiments in which targeted expression of the mutant PTH/PTHrP 
receptor  to  the  proliferating  chondrocyte  layer  of  growth  plate  emu-
lated several features of the human disorder. Other genetic mutations 
in the parathyroid gland or PTH target cells that affect Ca2+ metabolism 
are illustrated in Figure 410-5.

 ■ MALIGNANCY-RELATED HYPERCALCEMIA
Clinical  Syndromes  and  Mechanisms  of  Hypercalcemia  
Hypercalcemia due to malignancy is common (occurring in as many 
as 20% of cancer patients, especially with certain types of tumors such 

as lung carcinoma), often severe and difficult to manage, and, on rare 
occasions, difficult to distinguish from primary hyperparathyroidism. 
Although  malignancy  is  usually  clinically  obvious  or  readily  detect-
able by medical history, hypercalcemia can occasionally be due to an 
occult  tumor.  Previously,  hypercalcemia  associated  with  malignancy 
was  thought  to  be  due  to  local  invasion  and  destruction  of  bone  by 
tumor cells; many cases are now known to result from the elaboration 
by the malignant cells of humoral mediators of hypercalcemia. PTHrP 
is  the  responsible  humoral  agent  in  most  solid  tumors  that  cause 
hypercalcemia.

The  histologic  character  of  the  tumor  is  more  important  than  the 
extent  of  skeletal  metastases  in  predicting  hypercalcemia.  Small-cell 
carcinoma  (oat  cell)  and  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung,  although  the 
most common lung tumors associated with skeletal metastases, rarely 
cause  hypercalcemia.  By  contrast,  many  patients  with  squamous  cell 
carcinoma  of  the  lung  develop  hypercalcemia.  Histologic  studies  of 
bone in patients with squamous cell or epidermoid carcinoma of the 
lung,  in  sites  invaded  by  tumor  as  well  as  areas  remote  from  tumor 
invasion, reveal increased bone resorption.

Two  main  mechanisms  of  hypercalcemia  are  operative  in  cancer 
hypercalcemia. Many solid tumors associated with hypercalcemia, par-
ticularly squamous cell and renal tumors, produce and secrete PTHrP 
that causes increased bone resorption and mediates the hypercalcemia 
through  systemic  actions  on  the  skeleton.  Alternatively,  direct  bone 
marrow invasion occurs with hematologic malignancies such as leuke-
mia,  lymphoma,  and  multiple  myeloma.  Lymphokines  and  cytokines 
(including PTHrP) produced by cells involved in the marrow response 
to the tumors promote resorption of bone through local destruction. 
Several hormones, hormone analogues, cytokines, and growth factors 
have been implicated as the result of clinical assays, in vitro tests, or 
chemical isolation. The etiologic factor produced by activated normal 
lymphocytes and by myeloma and lymphoma cells, originally termed 
osteoclast activation factor, now appears to represent the biologic action

FIGURE 410-5  Illustration of some genetic mutations that alter calcium metabolism by effects on the parathyroid cell or target cells of parathyroid hormone (PTH) action. 
Alterations in PTH production by the parathyroid cell can be caused by changes in the response to extracellular fluid calcium (Ca2+) that are detected by the calcium-sensing 
receptor (CaSR). Furthermore, PTH (or PTH-related peptide [PTHrP]) can show altered efficacy in target cells such as in proximal tubular cells, by altered function of its 
receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor) or the signal transduction proteins, G proteins such as Gsα that is linked to adenylate cyclase (AC), the enzyme responsible for producing 
cyclic AMP (cAMP) (also illustrated are Gαq/Gα11, which activate an alternate pathway of receptor signal transmission involving the generation of inositol triphosphate 
[IP3] or diacylglycerol [DAG]). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the CaSR cause familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FBHH) and homozygous mutations 
(both alleles mutated) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT); heterozygous gain-of-function causes autosomal dominant hypercalciuric hypocalcemia (ADHH). 
Other defects in parathyroid cell function that occur at the level of gene regulation (oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes) or transcription factors are discussed in the 
text. Blomstrand’s lethal chondrodysplasia is due to homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor, a neonatally lethal 
disorder, while pseudohypoparathyroidism involves inactivation at the level of the G proteins, specifically mutations that eliminate or reduce Gsα activity in the kidney 
(see text for details). Acrodysostosis can occur with (mutant regulatory subunit of PKA) or without hormonal resistance (mutant PDE4D or PDE3A). Jansen’s metaphyseal 
chondrodysplasia and McCune-Albright syndrome represent gain-of-function mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor and Gsα protein, respectively.

3180 of several different cytokines, probably interleukin 1 and lymphotoxin 
or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In some lymphomas, there is a third 
mechanism,  caused  by  an  increased  blood  level  of  1,25(OH)2D,  pro-
duced by the abnormal lymphocytes or adjacent macrophages.

In the more common mechanism, usually termed humoral hypercal-
cemia of malignancy (HHM), solid tumors (cancers of the lung and kid-
ney, in particular), in which bone metastases are absent, minimal, or 
not detectable clinically, secrete PTHrP measurable by immunoassay. 
Secretion  by  the  tumors  of  the  PTH-like  factor,  PTHrP,  activates  the 
PTHR1, resulting in a pathophysiology closely resembling hyperpara-
thyroidism,  but  with  normal  or  suppressed  PTH  levels.  The  clinical 
picture  resembles  primary  hyperparathyroidism  (hypophosphatemia 
accompanies hypercalcemia), and elimination or regression of the pri-
mary tumor leads to disappearance of the hypercalcemia.

As  in  hyperparathyroidism,  patients  with  the  HHM  have  elevated 
urinary nephrogenous cyclic AMP excretion, hypophosphatemia, and 
increased  urinary  phosphate  clearance.  However,  in  HHM,  immu-
noreactive PTH is undetectable or suppressed, making the differential 
diagnosis  easier.  Other  features  of  the  disorder  differ  from  those  of 
true  hyperparathyroidism.  Although  the  biologic  actions  of  PTH 
and PTHrP are exerted through the same receptor, subtle differences 
in  receptor  activation  by  the  two  ligands  must  account  for  some  of 
the  discordance  in  pathophysiology,  when  an  excess  of  one  or  the 
other  peptide  occurs.  Other  cytokines  elaborated  by  the  malignancy 
may  contribute  to  the  variations  from  hyperparathyroidism  in  these 
patients as well. Patients with HHM may have low to normal levels of 
1,25(OH)2D, instead of elevated levels as in true hyperparathyroidism. 
In some patients with the HHM, osteoclastic resorption is unaccompa-
nied by an osteoblastic or bone-forming response, implying inhibition 
of the normal coupling of bone formation and resorption.

Several  different  assays  (single-  or  double-antibody,  different 
epitopes) have been developed to detect PTHrP. Most data indicate that 
circulating PTHrP levels are undetectable or low in normal individuals 
except  perhaps  in  pregnancy  (high  in  human  milk)  and  elevated  in 
most cancer patients with the humoral syndrome. The etiologic mech-
anisms in cancer hypercalcemia may be multiple in the same patient. 
For  example,  in  breast  carcinoma  (metastatic  to  bone)  and  in  a  dis-
tinctive type of T-cell lymphoma/leukemia initiated by human T-cell 
lymphotropic virus I, hypercalcemia is caused by direct local lysis of 
bone as well as by a humoral mechanism involving excess production 
of PTHrP. Hyperparathyroidism has been reported to coexist with the 
humoral  cancer  syndrome,  and  rarely,  ectopic  hyperparathyroidism 
due to tumor elaboration of true PTH is reported.

Diagnostic  Issues  Levels  of  PTH  measured  by  the  double-anti-
body technique are undetectable or extremely low in tumor hypercal-
cemia, as would be expected with the mediation of the hypercalcemia 
by a factor other than PTH (the hypercalcemia suppresses the normal 
parathyroid glands). In a patient with minimal symptoms referred for 
hypercalcemia, low or undetectable PTH levels would focus attention 
on a possible occult malignancy (except for very rare cases of ectopic 
hyperparathyroidism).

Ordinarily,  the  diagnosis  of  cancer  hypercalcemia  is  not  difficult 
because  tumor  symptoms  are  prominent  when  hypercalcemia  is 
detected. Indeed, hypercalcemia may be noted incidentally during the 
workup of a patient with known or suspected malignancy. Clinical sus-
picion that malignancy is the cause of the hypercalcemia is heightened 
when  there  are  other  signs  or  symptoms  of  a  paraneoplastic  process 
such  as  weight  loss,  fatigue,  muscle  weakness,  or  unexplained  skin 
rash,  or  when  symptoms  specific  for  a  particular  tumor  are  present. 
Squamous  cell  tumors  are  most  frequently  associated  with  hypercal-
cemia,  particularly  tumors  of  the  lung,  kidney,  head  and  neck,  and 
urogenital  tract.  Radiologic  examinations  can  focus  on  these  areas 
when clinical evidence is unclear. Bone scans with technetium-labeled 
bisphosphonate  are  useful  for  detection  of  osteolytic  metastases;  the 
sensitivity is high, but specificity is low; results must be confirmed by 
conventional x-rays to be certain that areas of increased uptake are due 
to  osteolytic  metastases  per  se.  Bone  marrow  biopsies  are  helpful  in 
patients with anemia or abnormal peripheral blood smears.

TREATMENT
Malignancy-Related Hypercalcemia

Treatment  of  the  hypercalcemia  of  malignancy  is  first  directed 
to  control  of  tumor;  reduction  of  tumor  mass  usually  corrects 
hypercalcemia. If a patient has severe hypercalcemia yet has a good 
chance for effective tumor therapy, treatment of the hypercalcemia 
should  be  vigorous  while  awaiting  the  results  of  definitive  ther-
apy  (see  “General  Approach  to  Hypercalcemic  States”  below).  If 
hypercalcemia occurs in the late stages of a tumor that is resistant 
to  antitumor  therapy,  the  treatment  of  the  hypercalcemia  should 
be judicious as high calcium levels can have a mild sedating effect. 
Standard therapies for hypercalcemia (discussed below) are appli-
cable to patients with malignancy.

 ■ VITAMIN D–RELATED HYPERCALCEMIA
Vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia can be due to excessive ingestion 
of vitamin D analogs or abnormal metabolism of the vitamin. Abnor-
mal metabolism of the vitamin is usually acquired in association with 
a widespread granulomatous disorder. Vitamin D metabolism is care-
fully  regulated,  particularly  the  activity  of  renal  1α-hydroxylase,  the 
enzyme  responsible  for  the  production  of  1,25(OH)2D  (Chap.  409). 
The regulation of 1α-hydroxylase and the normal feedback suppression 
by 1,25(OH)2D seem to work less well in infants than in adults and to 
operate poorly, if at all, in sites other than the renal tubule; these phe-
nomena  may  explain  the  occurrence  of  hypercalcemia  secondary  to 
excessive 1,25(OH)2D production in infants with Williams’ syndrome 
(see below) and in adults with sarcoidosis or lymphoma.

Vitamin  D  Intoxication  Chronic  ingestion  of  40–100  times  the 
normal  physiologic  requirement  of  vitamin  D  (amounts  >40,000–
100,000 U/d) is usually required to produce significant hypercalcemia 
in otherwise healthy individuals. The stated upper limit of safe dietary 
intake is 2000 U/d (50 μg/d) in adults because of concerns about poten-
tial  toxic  effects  of  cumulative  supraphysiologic  doses.  These  recom-
mendations are now regarded as too restrictive, since some estimates 
are that in elderly individuals in northern latitudes, ≥2000 U/d may be 
necessary to avoid vitamin D insufficiency.

Hypercalcemia  in  vitamin  D  intoxication  is  due  to  an  excessive 
biologic action of the vitamin, perhaps the consequence of increased 
levels  of  25(OH)D  rather  than  merely  increased  levels  of  the  active 
metabolite  1,25(OH)2D  (the  latter  may  not  be  elevated  in  vitamin  D 
intoxication). These actions lead to both increased intestinal absorp-
tion of calcium and increased release of calcium from bone. 25(OH)
D has definite, if low, biologic activity in the intestine and bone. The 
production of 25(OH)D is less tightly regulated than is the production 
of 1,25(OH)2D. Hence concentrations of 25(OH)D are elevated several-
fold in patients with excess vitamin D intake.

The  diagnosis  is  substantiated  by  documenting  elevated  levels  of 
25(OH)D >100 ng/mL. Hypercalcemia is usually controlled by restric-
tion of dietary calcium intake and appropriate attention to hydration. 
These  measures,  plus  discontinuation  of  vitamin  D,  usually  lead  to 
resolution of hypercalcemia. However, because of the increased bone 
resorption  caused  by  high  levels  of  vitamin  D,  simple  cessation  of 
calcium intake is often insufficient therapy. Further, vitamin D stores 
in  fat  may  be  substantial,  and  vitamin  D  intoxication  may  persist 
for  weeks  after  vitamin  D  ingestion  is  terminated.  Such  patients  are 
responsive to glucocorticoids, which in doses of 40–100 mg/d of pred-
nisone or its equivalent usually return serum calcium levels to normal 
over several days; severe intoxication may require intensive therapy.

Sarcoidosis  and  Other  Granulomatous  Diseases 
In  patients 
with  sarcoidosis  and  other  granulomatous  diseases,  such  as  tuber-
culosis  and  fungal  infections,  excess  1,25(OH)2D  is  synthesized  in 
macrophages  or  other  cells  in  the  granulomas.  Indeed,  increased 
1,25(OH)2D levels have been reported in anephric patients with sarcoi-
dosis and hypercalcemia. Macrophages obtained from granulomatous 
tissue convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D at an increased rate. There is

a  positive  correlation  in  patients  with  sarcoidosis  between  25(OH)D 
levels (reflecting vitamin D intake) and the circulating concentrations 
of 1,25(OH)2D, whereas normally, there is no increase in 1,25(OH)2D 
with  increasing  25(OH)D  levels  due  to  multiple  feedback  controls 
on  renal  1α-hydroxylase  (Chap.  409).  The  usual  regulation  of  active 
metabolite production by calcium and phosphate or by PTH does not 
operate in these patients. Instead, macrophages increase their produc-
tion of the vitamin D receptor and of the 1α-hydroxylase in response 
to tumor necrosis factor and other inflammatory stimuli. Clearance of 
1,25(OH)2D from blood may be decreased in sarcoidosis as well. PTH 
levels are usually low and 1,25(OH)2D levels are elevated, but primary 
hyperparathyroidism and sarcoidosis may coexist in some patients.

Management  of  the  hypercalcemia  can  often  be  accomplished  by 
avoiding excessive sunlight exposure and limiting vitamin D and cal-
cium intake. Presumably, however, the abnormal sensitivity to vitamin 
D and abnormal regulation of 1,25(OH)2D synthesis will persist as long 
as the disease is active. Alternatively, glucocorticoids in the equivalent 
of 100 mg/d of hydrocortisone or equivalent doses of glucocorticoids 
may  help  control  hypercalcemia.  Glucocorticoids  appear  to  act  by 
blocking excessive production of 1,25(OH)2D, as well as the response 
to it in target organs.

Hypercalcemia  of  Infancy  Several  variants  of  this  rare  abnor-
mality of calcium homeostasis are now known. For example, Williams’ 
syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple 
congenital development defects, including supravalvular aortic steno-
sis, intellectual disability, and an elfin facies, in association with hyper-
calcemia due to abnormal sensitivity to vitamin D. The hypercalcemia 
associated with the syndrome was first recognized in England, where 
it  was  thought,  incorrectly,  to  be  caused  by  the  fortification  of  milk 
with  vitamin  D.  The  cardiac  and  developmental  abnormalities  were 
independently  described,  but  the  connection  between  these  defects 
and hypercalcemia was not described until later. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D 
can  be  elevated,  ranging  from  46  to  120  nmol/L  (150–500  pg/mL). 
The  mechanism  of  the  abnormal  sensitivity  to  vitamin  D  and  of  the 
increased  circulating  levels  of  1,25(OH)2D  is  still  unclear.  Studies 
suggest that genetic mutations involving microdeletions at the elastin 
locus and perhaps other genes on chromosome 7 may play a role in the 
pathogenesis.  Other  more  recently  defined  causes  of  hypercalcemia 
in  infants  and  young  children  can  be  24-hydroxylase  deficiency  that 
impairs metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D or homozygous mutations involv-
ing the sodium-dependent phosphate transporters (NPT2a mutations 
lead to more severe hypercalcemia than NPT2c mutations).

 ■ HIGH-BONE-TURNOVER STATES
Hyperthyroidism  As many as 20% of hyperthyroid patients have 
high-normal or mildly elevated serum calcium concentrations; hyper-
calciuria is even more common. The hypercalcemia is due to increased 
bone turnover, with bone resorption exceeding bone formation. Severe 
calcium elevations are not typical, and the presence of such suggests a 
concomitant disease such as hyperparathyroidism. Usually, the diagno-
sis is obvious, but signs of hyperthyroidism may occasionally be occult, 
particularly in the elderly (Chap. 384). Hypercalcemia is managed by 
treatment  of  the  hyperthyroidism.  Reports  that  thyroid-stimulating 
hormone  (TSH)  itself  normally  has  a  bone-protective  effect  suggest 
that suppressed TSH levels also play a role in hypercalcemia.

Immobilization 
Immobilization  is  a  rare  cause  of  hypercalcemia 
in adults in the absence of an associated disease but may cause hyper-
calcemia  in  children  and  adolescents,  particularly  after  spinal  cord 
injury and paraplegia or quadriplegia. With resumption of ambulation, 
the hypercalcemia in children usually returns to normal.

The  mechanism  appears  to  involve  a  disproportion  between  bone 
formation  and  bone  resorption;  the  former  decreased  and  the  latter 
increased.  Hypercalciuria  and  increased  mobilization  of  skeletal  cal-
cium can develop in normal volunteers subjected to extensive bed rest, 
although hypercalcemia is unusual. Immobilization of an adult with a 
disease  associated  with  high  bone  turnover,  however,  such  as  Paget’s 
disease, may cause hypercalcemia.

Thiazides  Administration  of  benzothiadiazines  (thiazides)  can 
cause  hypercalcemia  in  patients  with  high  rates  of  bone  turnover. 
Commonly, thiazides are associated with aggravation of hypercalcemia 
in primary hyperparathyroidism, but this effect can be seen in other 
high-bone-turnover states as well. The mechanism of thiazide action is 
complex. Chronic thiazide administration leads to reduction in urinary 
calcium;  the  hypocalciuric  effect  appears  to  reflect  the  enhancement 
of proximal tubular resorption of sodium and calcium in response to 
sodium depletion. Some of this renal effect is due to augmentation of 
PTH action and is more pronounced in individuals with intact PTH 
secretion. However, thiazides cause hypocalciuria in hypoparathyroid 
patients  on  high-dose  vitamin  D  and  oral  calcium  replacement  if 
sodium  intake  is  restricted.  This  finding  is  the  rationale  for  the  use 
of  thiazides  as  an  adjunct  to  therapy  in  hypoparathyroid  patients,  as 
discussed below. Thiazide administration to normal individuals causes 
a  transient  increase  in  blood  calcium  (usually  within  the  high-nor-
mal  range)  that  reverts  to  preexisting  levels  after  a  week  or  more  of 
continued  administration.  If  hormonal  function  and  calcium  and 
bone metabolism are normal, homeostatic controls are reset to coun-
teract the calcium-elevating effect of the thiazides. In the presence of 
hyperparathyroidism or increased bone turnover from another cause, 
homeostatic mechanisms are ineffective. The abnormal effects of the 
thiazide on calcium metabolism disappear within days of cessation of 
the drug.

Vitamin A Intoxication  Vitamin A intoxication is a rare cause of 
hypercalcemia and is most commonly a side effect of dietary faddism 
(Chap.  333).  Calcium  levels  can  be  elevated  into  the  3–3.5-mmol/L 
(12–14  mg/dL)  range  after  the  ingestion  of  50,000–100,000  units  of 
vitamin A daily (10–20 times the minimum daily requirement). Typi-
cal features of severe hypercalcemia include fatigue, anorexia, and, in 
some,  severe  muscle  and  bone  pain.  Excess  vitamin  A  intake  is  pre-
sumed to increase bone resorption.

The  diagnosis  can  be  established  by  history  and  by  measurement 
of  vitamin  A  levels  in  serum.  Occasionally,  skeletal  x-rays  reveal 
periosteal calcifications, particularly in the hands. Withdrawal of the 
vitamin is usually associated with prompt disappearance of the hyper-
calcemia and reversal of the skeletal changes. As in vitamin D intoxica-
tion, administration of 100 mg/d hydrocortisone or its equivalent leads 
to a rapid return of the serum calcium to normal.
 ■ RENAL FAILURE–ASSOCIATED HYPERCALCEMIA
Severe Secondary Hyperparathyroidism  The  pathogenesis  of 
secondary  hyperparathyroidism  in  CKD  is  incompletely  understood. 
Resistance to the normal level of PTH is a major factor contributing 
to the development of hypocalcemia, which, in turn, is a stimulus to 
parathyroid gland enlargement. Recent findings have indicated that an 
increase of FGF23 production by osteocytes (and possibly osteoblasts) 
in  bone  occurs  well  before  an  elevation  in  PTH  is  detected.  FGF23 
is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  the  renal  1α-hydroxylase,  and  the  FGF23- 
dependent  reduction  in  1,25(OH)2D  thus  seems  to  be  an  important 
stimulus for the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Secondary  hyperparathyroidism  occurs  not  only  in  patients  with 
renal  failure  but  also  in  those  with  osteomalacia  due  to  multiple 
causes (Chap. 409), including deficiency of vitamin D action and PHP 
(deficient  response  to  PTH  downstream  of  PTHR1  in  the  proximal 
renal  tubules).  For  both  disorders,  hypocalcemia  seems  to  be  the 
common  denominator  in  initiating  the  development  of  secondary 
hyperparathyroidism.  Primary  and  secondary  hyperparathyroidism 
can  be  distinguished  conceptually  by  the  autonomous  growth  of  the 
parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism (presumably irre-
versible)  and  the  adaptive  response  of  the  parathyroids  in  secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (typically reversible). In fact, reversal over weeks 
from  an  abnormal  pattern  of  secretion,  presumably  accompanied  by 
involution  of  parathyroid  gland  mass  to  normal,  occurs  in  patients 
with osteomalacia who have been treated effectively with calcium and 
vitamin D. However, it is now recognized that a true clonal outgrowth 
(irreversible)  can  arise  in  long-standing,  inadequately  treated  CKD 
(e.g., tertiary hyperparathyroidism; see below).

Patients  with  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  may  develop  bone 
pain,  ectopic  calcification,  and  pruritus.  The  bone  disease  seen  in 
patients  with  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  and  CKD  is  termed 
renal  osteodystrophy  and  affects  primarily  bone  turnover.  However, 
osteomalacia is frequently encountered as well and may be related to 
the circulating levels of FGF23.

Two other skeletal disorders have been frequently associated in the 
past  with  CKD  patients  treated  by  long-term  dialysis,  who  received 
aluminum-containing  phosphate  binders.  Aluminum  deposition  in 
bone (see below) leads to an osteomalacia-like picture. The other entity 
is a low- turnover bone disease termed “aplastic” or “adynamic” bone 
disease; PTH levels are lower than typically observed in CKD patients 
with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is believed that the condition 
is  caused,  at  least  in  part,  by  excessive  PTH  suppression,  which  may 
be  even  greater  than  previously  appreciated  in  light  of  evidence  that 
some  of  the  immunoreactive  PTH  detected  by  most  commercially 
available PTH assays is not the full-length biologically active molecule 
(as  discussed  above)  but  may  consist  of  amino-terminally  truncated 
fragments  that  do  not  activate  the  PTHR1.  The  low  PTH  level  is 
thought to contribute to low bone formation and consequent decreased 
ability  of  the  skeleton  to  incorporate  circulating  calcium  into  bone  
matrix.

TREATMENT
Hypercalcemia in Secondary Hyperparathyroidism

Medical therapy to reverse secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD 
includes  reduction  of  excessive  blood  phosphate  by  restriction  of 
dietary  phosphate,  the  use  of  nonabsorbable  phosphate  binders, 
and careful, selective addition of calcitriol (0.25–2 μg/d) or related 
analogues.  Calcium  carbonate  became  preferred  over  aluminum-
containing  antacids  to  prevent  aluminum-induced  bone  disease. 
However, synthetic gels that also bind phosphate (such as sevelamer; 
Chap. 311) are now widely used, with the advantage of avoiding not 
only  aluminum  retention  but  also  excess  calcium  loading,  which 
may  contribute  to  cardiovascular  calcifications.  Intravenous  cal-
citriol  (or  related  analogues),  administered  as  several  pulses  each 
week, helps control secondary hyperparathyroidism. Aggressive but 
carefully  administered  medical  therapy  can  often,  but  not  always, 
reverse hyperparathyroidism and its symptoms and manifestations.
Occasional patients develop severe manifestations of secondary 
hyperparathyroidism,  including  hypercalcemia,  pruritus,  extras-
keletal calcifications, and painful bones, despite aggressive medical 
efforts  to  suppress  the  hyperparathyroidism.  PTH  hypersecretion 
no  longer  responsive  to  medical  therapy,  a  state  of  severe  hyper-
parathyroidism in patients with CKD that requires surgery, has been 
referred to as tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid surgery is 
necessary to control this condition. Based on genetic evidence from 
examination  of  tumor  samples  in  these  patients,  the  emergence 
of  autonomous  parathyroid  function  is  due  to  a  monoclonal  out-
growth of one or more previously hyperplastic parathyroid glands. 
The adaptive response has become an independent contributor to 
disease; this finding seems to emphasize the importance of optimal 
medical  management  to  reduce  the  proliferative  response  of  the 
parathyroid cells that enables the irreversible genetic change.

 ■ OTHER CAUSES OF HYPERCALCEMIA
Aluminum  Intoxication  Aluminum  intoxication  (and  often 
hypercalcemia  as  a  complication  of  medical  treatment)  in  the  past 
occurred  in  patients  on  chronic  dialysis;  manifestations  included 
acute dementia and unresponsive and severe osteomalacia. Bone pain, 
multiple nonhealing fractures, particularly of the ribs and pelvis, and 
a  proximal  myopathy  occur.  Hypercalcemia  develops  when  these 
patients  are  treated  with  vitamin  D  or  calcitriol  because  of  impaired 
skeletal responsiveness. Aluminum is present at the site of osteoid min-
eralization, osteoblastic activity is minimal, and calcium incorporation 
into the skeleton is impaired. The disorder is now rare because of the 

avoidance of aluminum-containing antacids or aluminum excess in the 
dialysis regimen.

Milk-Alkali Syndrome  The milk-alkali syndrome is due to exces-
sive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or cal-
cium carbonate. It is much less frequent since proton pump inhibitors 
and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease. For a 
time,  the  increased  use  of  calcium  carbonate  in  the  management  of 
secondary hyperparathyroidism led to reappearance of the syndrome. 
Several  clinical  presentations—acute,  subacute,  and  chronic—have 
been described, all of which feature hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal 
failure. The chronic form of the disease, termed Burnett’s syndrome, is 
associated with irreversible renal damage. The acute syndromes reverse 
if the excess calcium and absorbable alkali are stopped.

Individual susceptibility is important in the pathogenesis, as some 
patients are treated with calcium carbonate and alkali regimens with-
out developing the syndrome. One variable is the fractional calcium 
absorption as a function of calcium intake. Some individuals absorb a 
high fraction of calcium, even with intakes ≥2 g of elemental calcium 
per day, instead of reducing calcium absorption with high intake, as 
occurs  in  most  normal  individuals.  Resultant  mild  hypercalcemia 
after meals in such patients is postulated to contribute to the gener-
ation  of  alkalosis.  Development  of  hypercalcemia  causes  increased 
sodium  excretion  and  some  depletion  of  total-body  water.  These 
phenomena  and  perhaps  some  suppression  of  endogenous  PTH 
secretion  due  to  mild  hypercalcemia  lead  to  increased  bicarbonate 
resorption and to alkalosis in the face of continued calcium carbonate 
ingestion.  Alkalosis  per  se  selectively  enhances  calcium  resorption 
in the distal nephron, thus aggravating the hypercalcemia. The cycle 
of  mild  hypercalcemia  →  bicarbonate  retention  →  alkalosis  →  renal 
calcium retention → severe hypercalcemia perpetuates and aggravates 
hypercalcemia and alkalosis as long as calcium and absorbable alkali 
are ingested.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF HYPERCALCEMIA
Differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia is best achieved by using clin-
ical criteria, but immunometric assays to measure PTH are especially 
useful in distinguishing among major causes (Fig. 410-6). The clinical 
features  that  deserve  emphasis  are  the  presence  or  absence  of  symp-
toms  or  signs  of  disease  and  evidence  of  chronicity.  If  one  discounts 
fatigue  or  depression,  >90%  of  patients  with  primary  hyperparathy-
roidism  have  asymptomatic  hypercalcemia;  symptoms  of  malignancy 
are  usually  present  in  cancer-associated  hypercalcemia.  Disorders 
other than hyperparathyroidism and malignancy cause <10% of cases 
of hypercalcemia, and some of the nonparathyroid causes are associ-
ated with clear-cut manifestations such as renal failure.

Hyperparathyroidism is the likely diagnosis in patients with chronic 
hypercalcemia. If hypercalcemia has been manifest for >1 year, malig-
nancy  can  usually  be  excluded  as  the  cause.  A  striking  feature  of  
malignancy-associated  hypercalcemia  is  the  rapidity  of  the  course, 
whereby signs and symptoms of the underlying malignancy are evident 
within  months  of  the  detection  of  hypercalcemia.  Although  clinical 
considerations  are  helpful  in  arriving  at  the  correct  diagnosis  of  the 
cause  of  hypercalcemia,  appropriate  laboratory  testing  is  essential 
for definitive diagnosis. The immunoassay for PTH usually separates 
hyperparathyroidism  from  all  other  causes  of  hypercalcemia  (excep-
tions are very rare reports of ectopic production of excess PTH by non-
parathyroid tumors). Patients with hyperparathyroidism have elevated 
PTH  levels  despite  hypercalcemia,  whereas  patients  with  malignancy 
and the other causes of hypercalcemia (except for disorders mediated 
by  PTH  such  as  lithium-induced  hypercalcemia)  have  levels  of  hor-
mone below normal or undetectable. Assays based on the double-anti-
body method for PTH exhibit very high sensitivity (especially if serum 
calcium is simultaneously evaluated) and specificity for the diagnosis 
of primary hyperparathyroidism (Fig. 410-4).

In summary, PTH values are elevated in >90% of parathyroid-related 
causes  of  hypercalcemia,  undetectable  or  low  in  malignancy-related 
hypercalcemia, and undetectable or normal in vitamin D–related and 
high-bone-turnover causes of hypercalcemia. In view of the specificity

of  the  PTH  immunoassay  and  the  high  frequency  of  hyperparathy-
roidism  in  hypercalcemic  patients,  it  is  cost-effective  to  measure  the 
PTH level in all hypercalcemic patients unless malignancy or a specific 
nonparathyroid  disease  is  obvious.  False-positive  PTH  assay  results 
are  rare  but  can  be  due  to  heterotopic  antibodies.  Immunoassays  for 
PTHrP are helpful in diagnosing certain types of malignancy-associ-
ated hypercalcemia. Although FHH is parathyroid-related, the disease 
should  be  managed  distinctively  from  hyperparathyroidism.  Clinical 
features  and  the  low  urinary  calcium  excretion  can  help  make  the 
distinction.  Because  the  incidence  of  malignancy  and  hyperparathy-
roidism both increase with age, they can coexist as two independent 
causes of hypercalcemia.

1,25(OH)2D levels are elevated in many (but not all) patients with 
primary  hyperparathyroidism.  In  other  disorders  associated  with 
hypercalcemia, concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D are low or, at the most, 
normal. However, this test is of low specificity and is not cost-effective, 
as not all patients with hyperparathyroidism have elevated 1,25(OH)2D 
levels  and  not  all  nonparathyroid  hypercalcemic  patients  have  sup-
pressed  1,25(OH)2D.  Measurement  of  1,25(OH)2D  is,  however,  criti-
cally valuable in establishing the cause of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis 
and certain lymphomas.

A  useful  general  approach  is  outlined  in  Fig.  410-6.  If  the  patient 
is asymptomatic and there is evidence of chronicity to the hypercalce-
mia, hyperparathyroidism is almost certainly the cause. If PTH levels 
(usually measured at least twice) are elevated, the clinical impression is 
confirmed and little additional evaluation is necessary. If there is only a 
short history or no data as to the duration of the hypercalcemia, occult 
malignancy must be considered; if the PTH levels are not elevated, then 
a  thorough  workup  must  be  undertaken  for  malignancy,  including 
chest x-ray, CT of chest and abdomen, and bone scan. Immunoassays 
for PTHrP may be especially useful in such situations. Attention should 
also be paid to clues for underlying hematologic disorders such as ane-
mia, increased plasma globulin, and abnormal serum immunoelectro-
phoresis; bone scans can be negative in some patients with metastases 
such as in multiple myeloma. Finally, if a patient with chronic hyper-
calcemia is asymptomatic and malignancy therefore seems unlikely on 
clinical grounds, but PTH values are not elevated, it is useful to search 
for other chronic causes of hypercalcemia such as occult sarcoidosis. A 
careful history of dietary supplements and drug use may suggest intox-
ication with vitamin D or vitamin A or the use of thiazides.

TREATMENT
General Approach to Hypercalcemic States

The approach to medical treatment of hypercalcemia varies with its 
severity. Mild hypercalcemia, <3 mmol/L (12 mg/dL), can be man-
aged  by  hydration.  More  severe  hypercalcemia  (levels  of  3.2–3.7 
mmol/L [13–15 mg/dL]) must be managed aggressively; above that 
level, hypercalcemia can be life-threatening and requires emergency 
measures  (Table  410-4).  By  using  a  combination  of  approaches 
in severe hypercalcemia, the serum calcium concentration can be 
decreased within 24–48 h in most patients, enough to relieve acute 
symptoms,  prevent  death  from  hypercalcemic  crisis,  and  permit 
diagnostic evaluation. Therapy can then be directed at the underly-
ing disorder—the second priority.

Hypercalcemia  develops  because  of  excessive  skeletal  calcium 
release, increased intestinal calcium absorption, or inadequate renal 
calcium excretion. Understanding the particular pathogenesis helps 
guide therapy. For example, hypercalcemia in patients with malig-
nancy is primarily due to excessive skeletal calcium release and is, 
therefore,  minimally  improved  by  restriction  of  dietary  calcium. 
On  the  other  hand,  patients  with  vitamin  D  hypersensitivity  or   
vitamin D intoxication have excessive intestinal calcium absorption, 
and  restriction  of  dietary  calcium  is  beneficial.  Decreased  renal 
function  or  ECF  depletion  decreases  urinary  calcium  excretion. 
In  such  situations,  rehydration  may  rapidly  reduce  or  reverse  the 
hypercalcemia, even though increased bone resorption persists. As 
outlined below, the more severe the hypercalcemia, the greater is the 
number  of  combined  therapies  that  should  be  used.  Rapid-acting 
(hours) approaches—rehydration, forced diuresis, and calcitonin—
can  be  used  with  the  most  effective  antiresorptive  agents  such 
as  bisphosphonates  (since  severe  hypercalcemia  usually  involves 
excessive bone resorption). 

HYDRATION, INCREASED SALT INTAKE, AND MILD AND 
FORCED DIURESIS
The  first  principle  of  treatment  is  to  restore  normal  hydration. 
Many hypercalcemic patients are dehydrated because of vomiting, 
inanition,  and/or  hypercalcemia-induced  defects  in  urinary  con-
centrating ability. The resultant drop in glomerular filtration rate is

accompanied by an additional decrease in renal tubular sodium and 
calcium clearance. Restoring a normal ECF volume corrects these 
abnormalities  and  increases  urine  calcium  excretion  by  2.5–7.5 
mmol/d  (100–300  mg/d).  Increasing  urinary  sodium  excretion  to 
400–500 mmol/d increases urinary calcium excretion even further 
than  simple  rehydration.  After  rehydration  has  been  achieved, 
saline  can  be  administered  or  furosemide  or  ethacrynic  acid  can 
be given twice daily to depress the tubular reabsorptive mechanism 
for calcium (care must be taken to prevent dehydration). The com-
bined use of these therapies can increase urinary calcium excretion 
to ≥12.5 mmol/d (500 mg/d) in most hypercalcemic patients. Since 
this  is  a  substantial  percentage  of  the  exchangeable  calcium  pool, 
the  serum  calcium  concentration  usually  falls  0.25–0.75  mmol/L 
(1–3 mg/dL) within 24 h. Precautions should be taken to prevent 
potassium  and  magnesium  depletion;  calcium-containing  renal 
calculi are a potential complication.

Under  life-threatening  circumstances,  the  preceding  approach 
can  be  pursued  more  aggressively,  but  the  availability  of  effective 
agents  to  block  bone  resorption  (such  as  bisphosphonates)  has 
reduced  the  need  for  extreme  diuresis  regimens  (Table  410-4). 
Depletion of potassium and magnesium is inevitable unless replace-
ments are given; pulmonary edema can be precipitated. The poten-
tial complications can be reduced by careful monitoring of central 
venous  pressure  and  plasma  or  urine  electrolytes;  catheterization 
of the bladder may be necessary. Dialysis treatment may be needed 
when renal function is compromised. 
BISPHOSPHONATES
The  bisphosphonates  are  analogues  of  pyrophosphate,  with  high 
affinity  for  bone,  especially  in  areas  of  increased  bone  turnover, 
where they are powerful inhibitors of bone resorption. These bone-
seeking compounds are stable in vivo because phosphatase enzymes 
cannot hydrolyze the central carbon-phosphorus-carbon bond. The 
bisphosphonates  are  concentrated  in  areas  of  high  bone  turnover 
and are taken up by and inhibit osteoclast action; the mechanism 
of  action  is  complex.  The  bisphosphonate  molecules  that  contain 
amino  groups  in  the  side  chain  structure  (see  below)  interfere 
with prenylation of proteins and can lead to cellular apoptosis. The 

highly active nonamino group–containing bisphosphonates are also 
metabolized to cytotoxic products.

A  number  of  second-  or  third-generation  compounds  have 
become  the  mainstays  of  antiresorptive  therapy  for  treatment  of 
hypercalcemia and osteoporosis. The newer bisphosphonates have 
a  highly  favorable  ratio  of  blocking  resorption  versus  inhibiting 
bone formation; they inhibit osteoclast-mediated skeletal resorption 
yet do not cause mineralization defects at ordinary doses. Though 
the bisphosphonates have similar structures, the routes of adminis-
tration, efficacy, toxicity, and side effects vary. The potency of the 
compounds  for  inhibition  of  bone  resorption  varies  >10,000-fold, 
increasing in the order of etidronate, tiludronate, pamidronate, alen-
dronate, risedronate, and zoledronate. The IV use of pamidronate 
and  zoledronate  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  hypercalcemia; 
between 30 and 90 mg pamidronate, given as a single IV dose over a 
few hours, returns serum calcium to normal within 24–48 h with an 
effect that lasts for weeks in 80–100% of patients. Zoledronate given 
in doses of 4 or 8 mg per 5-min infusion has a more rapid and more 
sustained effect than pamidronate in direct comparison.

These  drugs  are  used  extensively  in  cancer  patients.  Abso-
lute survival improvements are noted with pamidronate and zole-
dronate  in  multiple  myeloma,  for  example.  However,  though  still 
rare,  there  are  increasing  reports  of  jaw  necrosis,  especially  after 
dental  surgery,  mainly  in  cancer  patients  treated  with  multiple 
doses of the more potent bisphosphonates. 
DENOSUMAB
Denosumab is the most recent antiresorptive therapy to be approved 
for  the  treatment  of  hypercalcemia,  a  monoclonal  antibody  that 
binds to RANK ligand (RANKL) and prevents it from binding to 
the  receptor  RANK  on  osteoclast  precursors  and  mature  osteo-
clasts.  The  inhibition  of  differentiation,  activation,  and  function 
of osteoclasts leads to a reduction in bone resorption. It has a pro-
found suppressive effect on biochemical markers of bone resorption 
and  is  the  most  powerful  antiresorptive  agent  currently  available. 
Repeated doses of denosumab, 120 mg given subcutaneously, may 
be effective in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy who have 
lost responsiveness to bisphosphonates.

Calcitonin acts within a few hours of its administration, principally 
through receptors on osteoclasts, to block bone resorption. Calcito-
nin, after 24 h of use, is no longer effective in lowering calcium. Tac-
hyphylaxis, a known phenomenon with this drug, seems to explain 
the  results  since  the  drug  is  initially  often  effective.  Therefore,  in 
life-threatening  hypercalcemia,  calcitonin  can  be  used  effectively 
within  the  first  24  h  in  combination  with  rehydration  and  saline 
diuresis  while  waiting  for  more  sustained  effects  from  a  simulta-
neously administered bisphosphonate such as pamidronate. Usual 
doses of calcitonin are 2–8 U/kg of body weight IV, SC, or IM every 
6–12  h.  Plicamycin  (formerly  mithramycin),  which  inhibits  bone 
resorption, and gallium nitrate, which exerts a hypocalcemic action 
also by inhibiting bone resorption, are no longer used because of 
superior alternatives such as bisphosphonates.

Glucocorticoids have utility, especially in hypercalcemia compli-
cating certain malignancies. They increase urinary calcium excre-
tion  and  decrease  intestinal  calcium  absorption  when  given  in 
pharmacologic doses, but they also cause negative skeletal calcium 
balance. In normal individuals and in patients with primary hyper-
parathyroidism,  glucocorticoids  neither  increase  nor  decrease  the 
serum calcium concentration. In patients with hypercalcemia due 
to  certain  osteolytic  malignancies,  however,  glucocorticoids  may 
be  effective  as  a  result  of  antitumor  effects.  The  malignancies  in 
which  hypercalcemia  responds  to  glucocorticoids  include  multi-
ple myeloma, leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease, other lymphomas, and 
carcinoma of the breast, at least early in the course of the disease. 
Glucocorticoids are also effective in treating hypercalcemia due to 
vitamin  D  intoxication  and  sarcoidosis.  Glucocorticoids  are  also 
useful in the rare form of hypercalcemia, now recognized in certain 
autoimmune disorders in which inactivating antibodies against the 
receptor imitate FHH. Elevated PTH and calcium levels are effec-
tively lowered by the glucocorticoids. In all the preceding situations, 
the hypocalcemic effect develops over several days, and the usual 
glucocorticoid dosage is 40–100 mg prednisone (or its equivalent) 
daily in four divided doses. The side effects of chronic glucocorti-
coid therapy may be acceptable in some circumstances.

Dialysis is often the treatment of choice for severe hypercalcemia 
complicated by renal failure, which is difficult to manage medically. 
Peritoneal  dialysis  with  calcium-free  dialysis  fluid  can  remove 
5–12.5 mmol (200–500 mg) of calcium in 24–48 h and lower the 
serum  calcium  concentration  by  0.7–2.2  mmol/L  (3–9  mg/dL). 
Large  quantities  of  phosphate  are  lost  during  dialysis,  and  serum 
inorganic phosphate concentration usually falls, potentially aggra-
vating  hypercalcemia.  Therefore,  the  serum  inorganic  phosphate 
concentration  should  be  measured  after  dialysis,  and  phosphate 
supplements  should  be  added  to  the  diet  or  to  dialysis  fluids  if 
necessary.

Phosphate  therapy,  PO  or  IV,  has  a  limited  role  in  certain  cir-
cumstances  (Chap.  409).  Correcting  hypophosphatemia  lowers 
the  serum  calcium  concentration  by  several  mechanisms,  includ-
ing  bone/calcium  exchange.  The  usual  oral  treatment  is  1–1.5  g 
phosphorus  per  day  for  several  days,  given  in  divided  doses.  It  is 
generally believed, but not established, that toxicity does not occur 
if  therapy  is  limited  to  restoring  serum  inorganic  phosphate  con-
centrations to normal.

Raising the serum inorganic phosphate concentration above nor-
mal decreases serum calcium levels, sometimes strikingly. Intrave-
nous phosphate is one of the most dramatically effective treatments 
available for severe hypercalcemia but is toxic and even dangerous 
(fatal hypocalcemia). For these reasons, it is used rarely and only in 
severely hypercalcemic patients with cardiac or renal failure where 
dialysis, the preferable alternative, is not feasible or is unavailable. 
SUMMARY
The  various  therapies  for  hypercalcemia  are  listed  in  Table  410-4. 
The  choice  depends  on  the  underlying  disease,  the  severity  of 
the  hypercalcemia,  the  serum  inorganic  phosphate  level,  and  the 
renal,  hepatic,  and  bone  marrow  function.  Mild  hypercalcemia

(≤3  mmol/L  [12  mg/dL])  can  usually  be  managed  by  hydration. 
Severe  hypercalcemia  (≥3.7  mmol/L  [15  mg/dL])  requires  rapid 
correction. IV pamidronate or zoledronate or subcutaneous deno-
sumab should be administered. In addition, for the first 24–48 h, 
aggressive sodium-calcium diuresis with IV saline should be given 
and, following rehydration, large doses of furosemide or ethacrynic 
acid,  but  only  if  appropriate  monitoring  is  available  and  cardiac 
and  renal  function  are  adequate.  Intermediate  degrees  of  hyper-
calcemia between 3 and 3.7 mmol/L (12 and 15 mg/dL) should be 
approached with vigorous hydration and then the most appropri-
ate selection for the patient of the combinations used with severe 
hypercalcemia.

 ■ HYPOCALCEMIA
(See also Chap. 54)

Pathophysiology  Chronic  hypocalcemia  is  less  common  than 
hypercalcemia;  causes  include  CKD,  hereditary  and  acquired 
hypoparathyroidism,  vitamin  D  deficiency,  PTH  resistance,  and 
hypomagnesemia.

Acute  rather  than  chronic  hypocalcemia  is  seen  in  critically  ill 
patients or as a consequence of certain medications and often does not 
require specific treatment. Transient hypocalcemia is seen with severe 
sepsis,  burns,  acute  kidney  injury,  and  extensive  transfusions  with 
citrated blood. Although as many as one-half of patients in an inten-
sive  care  setting  are  reported  to  have  calcium  concentrations  of  <2.1 
mmol/L (8.5 mg/dL), most do not have a reduction in ionized calcium. 
Patients with severe sepsis may have a decrease in ionized calcium (true 
hypocalcemia), but in other severely ill individuals, hypoalbuminemia 
is the primary cause of the reduced total calcium concentration. Alka-
losis increases calcium binding to proteins.

Medications  such  as  protamine,  heparin,  and  glucagon  may  cause 
transient hypocalcemia. These forms of hypocalcemia are usually not 
associated  with  tetany  and  resolve  with  improvement  in  the  overall 
medical  condition.  The  hypocalcemia  after  repeated  transfusions  of 
citrated blood usually resolves quickly.

Patients  with  acute  pancreatitis  have  hypocalcemia  that  persists 
during  the  acute  inflammation  and  varies  in  degree  with  disease 
severity. The cause of hypocalcemia remains unclear. PTH values are 
reported to be low, normal, or elevated, and both resistance to PTH and 
impaired PTH secretion have been postulated. Occasionally, a chronic 
low total calcium and low ionized calcium concentration are detected 
in an elderly patient without obvious cause and with a paucity of symp-
toms; the pathogenesis is unclear.

Chronic  hypocalcemia,  however,  is  usually  symptomatic  and 
requires  treatment.  Neuromuscular  and  neurologic  manifestations  of 
chronic hypocalcemia include muscle spasms, carpopedal spasm, facial 
grimacing,  and,  in  extreme  cases,  laryngeal  spasm  and  convulsions. 
Respiratory arrest may occur. Increased intracranial pressure occurs in 
some  patients  with  long-standing  hypocalcemia,  often  in  association 
with papilledema. Mental changes include irritability, depression, and 
psychosis. The QT interval on the electrocardiogram is prolonged, in 
contrast to its shortening with hypercalcemia. Arrhythmias occur, and 
digitalis effectiveness may be reduced. Intestinal cramps and chronic 
malabsorption may occur. Chvostek’s or Trousseau’s sign can be used 
to confirm latent tetany.

Classification  of  Hypocalcemia  The  classification  of  hypocal-
cemia  shown  in  Table  410-5  is  based  on  an  organizationally  useful 
premise  that  PTH  is  responsible  for  minute-to-minute  regulation  of 
plasma  calcium  concentration  and,  therefore,  that  the  occurrence  of 
hypocalcemia must mean a failure of the homeostatic action of PTH. 
Failure of the PTH response can occur if there is hereditary or acquired 
parathyroid gland failure, if a mutant PTH is secreted, if PTH is ineffec-
tive in target organs, or if the action of the hormone is overwhelmed by 
the loss of calcium from the ECF at a rate faster than it can be replaced.

PTH Absent  Hereditary or acquired forms of hypoparathyroidism 
have a number of common components. The disease is rare with esti-
mates from all causes to be ~25–35 patients/100,000 of the population

(based on U.S. and Danish estimates). Symptoms of untreated hypoc-
alcemia  are  shared  by  both  types  of  hypoparathyroidism,  although 
the onset of hereditary hypoparathyroidism can be more gradual and 
associated with other developmental defects. Basal ganglia calcification 
and extrapyramidal syndromes are more common and earlier in onset 
in hereditary hypoparathyroidism. Acquired hypoparathyroidism sec-
ondary to surgery in the neck is more common than hereditary hypo-
parathyroidism,  but  the  frequency  of  surgically  induced  parathyroid 
failure has diminished as a result of improved surgical techniques that 
spare the parathyroid glands and increased use of nonsurgical therapy 
for  hyperthyroidism.  PHP,  an  example  of  resistance  to  PTH  action 
rather than a failure of parathyroid gland production, may share several 
features with hypoparathyroidism, including extraosseous calcification 
and extrapyramidal manifestations such as choreoathetotic movements 
and dystonia.

Papilledema,  raised  intracranial  pressure,  and  lenticular  cataracts 
may  occur  in  both  hereditary  and  acquired  hypoparathyroidism,  as 
do chronic changes in fingernails and hair, the latter usually revers-
ible  with  treatment  of  hypocalcemia.  Certain  skin  manifestations, 
including  alopecia  and  candidiasis,  are  characteristic  of  hereditary 
hypoparathyroidism associated with autoimmune polyglandular fail-
ure (Chap. 388).

Hypocalcemia associated with hypomagnesemia is associated with 
both  deficient  PTH  release  and  impaired  responsiveness  to  the  hor-
mone.  Patients  with  hypocalcemia  secondary  to  hypomagnesemia 
have low levels of circulating PTH, indicative of diminished hormone 
release  despite  a  maximum  physiologic  stimulus  by  hypocalcemia. 
Hypoparathyroidism  can  be  due  to  hereditary  or  acquired  causes  or 
acute but reversible gland dysfunction (hypomagnesemia).

GENETIC  CAUSES  Hereditary  hypoparathyroidism  can  occur  as  an 
isolated entity without other endocrine or dermatologic manifestations 
or in association with other abnormalities (Chap. 388).

Hypoparathyroidism  Associated  with  Other  Abnormalities  Hypoparathyroidism 
associated  with  defective  development  of  both  the  thymus  and  the 
parathyroid  glands  is  termed  DiGeorge  syndrome,  or  the  velocardio-
facial syndrome. Congenital cardiovascular, facial, and other develop-
mental  defects  are  present,  and  patients  may  die  in  early  childhood 
with  severe  infections,  hypocalcemia  and  seizures,  or  cardiovascular 
complications. Patients can survive into adulthood, and milder, incom-
plete forms may become manifest in childhood or adolescence. Most 
cases are sporadic, but autosomal dominant forms involving microde-
letions of chromosome 22q11.2 or point mutations in the transcription 
factor  TBX1  in  that  chromosomal  region  exist.  Another  autosomal 
dominant  developmental  defect  with  hypoparathyroidism,  deafness, 

and renal dysplasia (HDR) is caused by mutations in the transcription 
factor GATA3 (chromosome 10p14), which is important in embryonic 
development and is expressed in developing kidney, ear structures, and 
the parathyroids. Autosomal recessive disorders comprising hypopara-
thyroidism include Kenney-Caffey syndrome type 1, which also features 
short stature, osteosclerosis, and thick cortical bones, and the related 
Sanjad-Sakati syndrome, which also exhibits growth failure and other 
dysmorphic features. Both syndromes involve mutations in a chaper-
one  protein  called  TBCE  (chromosome  1q42-q43),  which  is  relevant 
to  tubulin  function.  FAM111A  defects  (chromosome  11q12.1)  were 
identified as the cause of Kenney-Caffey syndrome type 2.

Hypoparathyroidism that can occur in association with a complex 
hereditary  autoimmune  syndrome  involving  failure  of  the  adrenals, 
the  ovaries,  the  immune  system,  and  the  parathyroids  in  association 
with recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis, alopecia, vitiligo, and per-
nicious anemia is commonly referred to as polyglandular autoimmune 
type 1 deficiency (Chap. 388). This disorder is caused by mutations in 
the AIRE gene (chromosome 21q22.3). A stop codon mutation occurs 
in  many  Finnish  families  with  the  disorder,  while  another  mutation 
(Y85C) is typically observed in Jews of Iraqi and Iranian descent.

Hypoparathyroidism  is  also  seen  in  two  disorders  associated  with 
mitochondrial  dysfunction  and  myopathy,  one  termed  Kearns-Sayre 
syndrome  (KSS),  with  ophthalmoplegia  and  pigmentary  retinopathy, 
and the other termed MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalopa-
thy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). Mutations or deletions in 
mitochondrial genes have been identified.

Isolated  Hypoparathyroidism  Several  forms  of  hypoparathyroidism,  each 
rare in frequency, are seen as isolated defects; the genetic mechanisms 
are  varied.  The  inheritance  includes  autosomal  dominant,  autosomal 
recessive, and X-linked modes.

PTH Mutations  Three  separate  autosomal  defects  involving  the  prepro 
sequence  of  PTH  have  been  recognized.  The  dominant  forms  are 
caused  by  point  mutations  in  a  critical  region  involved  in  intracellu-
lar transport of the hormone precursor. For example, an Arg for Cys 
mutation  interferes  with  processing  of  the  precursor  and  is  believed 
to trigger an apoptotic cellular response, hence acting as a dominant 
negative. The two recessive forms require both PTH alleles encoding 
the  prepro  sequence  to  be  mutated.  Only  one  homozygous  mutation 
affecting the secreted PTH (Arg25>Cys25) has been described thus far 
that leads to an autosomal recessive form of hypoparathyroidism. The 
defect for an X-linked recessive form of hypoparathyroidism has been 
localized to chromosome Xq26-q27, perhaps involving the SOX3 gene.

CaSR Mutations  Abnormalities in the CaSR are detected in three distinc-
tive hypocalcemic disorders. All are rare, but several different gain-of-
function  mutations  have  been  found  in  one  form  of  hypocalcemia 
termed autosomal dominant hypocalcemic hypercalciuria (ADHH). The 
receptor senses the ambient calcium level as excessive and suppresses 
PTH secretion, leading to hypocalcemia. The hypocalcemia is aggra-
vated by constitutive receptor activity in the renal tubule causing excre-
tion of inappropriate amounts of calcium. Recognition of the syndrome 
is important because efforts to treat the hypocalcemia with vitamin D 
analogues and increased oral calcium exacerbate the already excessive 
urinary calcium excretion (several grams or more per 24 h), leading to 
irreversible renal damage from stones and ectopic calcification.

Other Causes of Isolated Hypoparathyroidism  These include homozygous, inac-
tivating  mutations  in  the  parathyroid-specific  transcription  factor 
GCM2  or  heterozygous  point  mutations  in  this  protein,  which  have 
a dominant-negative effect on the wild-type protein and thus lead to 
an  autosomal  dominant  form  of  hypoparathyroidism.  Furthermore, 
heterozygous  mutations  in  Gα11,  one  of  the  two  signaling  proteins 
downstream of the CaSR, have been identified as a cause of autosomal 
dominant  hypoparathyroidism.  The  Bartter  syndrome  is  a  group  of 
disorders  associated  with  disturbances  in  electrolyte  and  acid-base 
balance, sometimes with nephrocalcinosis and other features. Several 
types of ion channels or transporters are involved. Curiously, Bartter 
syndrome  type  V  has  electrolyte  and  pH  disturbances  but  is  caused 
by a gain-of-function mutation in the CaSR. The defect may be more

severe than in ADHH and explains the additional features seen beyond 
hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria. As with autoimmune disorders that 
block  the  CaSR  (discussed  above  under  hypercalcemic  conditions), 
there  are  autoantibodies  that  at  least  transiently  activate  the  CaSR, 
leading to suppressed PTH secretion and hypocalcemia.
ACQUIRED  HYPOPARATHYROIDISM  Acquired  chronic  hypoparathy-
roidism is usually the result of inadvertent surgical removal of all the 
parathyroid glands; in some instances, not all the tissue is removed, but 
the  remainder  undergoes  vascular  supply  compromise  secondary  to 
fibrotic changes in the neck after surgery. In the past, the most frequent 
cause of acquired hypoparathyroidism was surgery for hyperthyroid-
ism. Hypoparathyroidism now usually occurs after surgery for hyper-
parathyroidism when the surgeon, facing the dilemma of removing too 
little tissue and thus not curing the hyperparathyroidism, removes too 
much.  Parathyroid  function  may  not  be  totally  absent  in  all  patients 
with postoperative hypoparathyroidism.

Rare causes of acquired chronic hypoparathyroidism include radia-
tion-induced damage subsequent to radioiodine therapy of hyperthy-
roidism  and  glandular  damage  in  patients  with  hemochromatosis  or 
hemosiderosis after repeated blood transfusions. Infection may involve 
one or more of the parathyroids but usually does not cause hypopara-
thyroidism because all four glands are rarely involved.

Transient  hypoparathyroidism  is  frequent  following  surgery  for 
hyperparathyroidism. After a variable period of hypoparathyroidism, 
normal parathyroid function may return due to hyperplasia or recov-
ery  of  remaining  tissue.  Occasionally,  recovery  occurs  months  after 
surgery.

TREATMENT
Acquired and Hereditary Hypoparathyroidism

Conventional  treatment  has  involved  replacement  with  vitamin 
D and 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) combined with a high oral calcium 
intake.  In  most  patients,  blood  calcium  and  phosphate  levels  are 
maintained  satisfactorily,  but  some  patients  show  a  tendency  to 
alternate between hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia, thus requiring 
close monitoring of each patient. Compared to typical daily require-
ments  in  euparathyroid  patients  (200–1000  U/d),  much  higher 
doses  of  vitamin  D  are  needed  for  the  treatment  of  hypopara-
thyroid  patients  (as  much  as  100-fold  higher),  which  reflects  the 
reduced conversion of vitamin D to 1,25(OH)2D. Thus, treatment 
with 1,25(OH)2D (0.5–1 μg/d of calcitriol) is frequently preferred, 
particularly since calcitriol is cleared much more rapidly from the 
circulation than vitamin D.

Oral  calcium  and  vitamin  D  restore  the  overall  calcium- 
phosphate balance but do not reverse the lowered urinary calcium 
reabsorption typical of hypoparathyroidism. Therefore, blood cal-
cium  levels  should  be  maintained  in  these  patients  at  the  lower 
end  of  the  normal  range  in  order  to  avoid  excessive  urinary  cal-
cium excretion; otherwise, nephrocalcinosis and kidney stones can 
develop, and the risk of CKD is increased. Thiazide diuretics lower 
urine calcium by as much as 100 mg/d in hypoparathyroid patients 
on vitamin D, provided they are maintained on a low-sodium diet. 
Use of thiazides seems to be of benefit in mitigating hypercalciuria 
and easing the daily management of these patients.

Until recently, hypoparathyroidism has been the only endocrine 
disorders  not  being  treated  with  the  missing  hormone.  After  the 
initial experimental use of PTH(1–34), the synthetic PTH fragment 
used  in  treatment  of  osteoporosis,  showed  promise,  full-length 
PTH(1–84) has been shown to be effective and is now approved by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for therapy of hypopara-
thyroidism. Published reports illustrate its use substantially reduced 
the  requirements  for  supplemental  calcium  and  active  vitamin  to 
maintain serum calcium but did not prevent, throughout the day, 
excessive urinary calcium losses.

HYPOMAGNESEMIA  Severe hypomagnesemia (<0.4 mmol/L; <0.8 meq/L) 
is  associated  with  hypocalcemia  (Chap.  409).  Restoration  of  the 

total-body magnesium deficit leads to rapid reversal of hypocalcemia. 
There  are  at  least  two  causes  of  the  hypocalcemia—impaired  PTH 
secretion and reduced responsiveness to PTH. For further discussion 
of causes and treatment of hypomagnesemia, see Chap. 409.

PTH levels are undetectable or inappropriately low in severe hypo-
magnesemia  despite  the  stimulus  of  severe  hypocalcemia,  and  acute 
repletion of magnesium leads to a rapid increase in PTH level. Serum 
phosphate  levels  are  often  not  elevated,  in  contrast  to  the  situation 
with  acquired  or  idiopathic  hypoparathyroidism,  probably  because 
phosphate deficiency is often seen in hypomagnesemia. In addition to 
diminished PTH secretion, some patients with low calcium and mag-
nesium levels show a blunted peripheral response to exogenous PTH 
as  documented  by  subnormal  response  in  urinary  phosphorus  and 
urinary cyclic AMP excretion.

TREATMENT
Hypomagnesemia

Repletion of magnesium cures the condition. Repletion should be 
parenteral.  Attention  must  be  given  to  restoring  the  intracellular 
deficit,  which  may  be  considerable.  After  IV  magnesium  admin-
istration, serum magnesium may return transiently to the normal 
range, but unless replacement therapy is adequate, serum magne-
sium  will  again  fall.  If  the  cause  of  the  hypomagnesemia  is  renal 
magnesium  wasting,  magnesium  may  have  to  be  given  long-term 
to prevent recurrence (Chap. 409).

PTH  Ineffective  PTH  is  ineffective  when  the  PTHR1–signaling 
protein  complex  is  defective  (as  in  the  different  forms  of  PHP,  dis-
cussed  below)  or  in  CKD  in  which  the  calcium-elevating  action  of 
PTH is impaired.

Typically, hypophosphatemia is more severe than hypocalcemia in 
vitamin D deficiency states because the increased PTH levels, although 
only partly effective in elevating blood calcium, are readily capable of 
promoting urinary phosphate excretion.

PHP, on the other hand, has a pathophysiology that is different from 
the  other  disorders  of  ineffective  PTH  action.  PHP  resembles  hypo-
parathyroidism (in which PTH synthesis is deficient) and is manifested 
by hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia yet elevated PTH levels. The 
cause  of  the  disorder  is  defective  PTH-dependent  activation  of  the 
stimulatory  G  protein  complex  or  the  downstream  effector  protein 
kinase  A,  resulting  in  failure  of  PTH  to  increase  intracellular  cyclic 
AMP or to respond to elevated cyclic AMP levels (see below).
CKD  Improved medical management of CKD allows many patients to 
survive for decades and, hence, provides time enough to develop fea-
tures of renal osteodystrophy, which must be controlled to avoid addi-
tional  morbidity.  Impaired  production  of  1,25(OH)2D  is  a  principal 
factor that causes calcium deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, 
and bone disease; hyperphosphatemia, which lowers further blood cal-
cium levels, typically occurs only in the later stages of the disease. Low 
levels of 1,25(OH)2D due to increased FGF23 production in bone (and 
possibly other tissues) are critical in the development of hypocalcemia. 
It is notable that FGF23 levels are often dramatically elevated in end-
stage kidney disease (ESKD). The uremic state also causes impairment 
of intestinal absorption by mechanisms other than defects in vitamin 
D metabolism. Nonetheless, treatment with supraphysiologic amounts 
of  vitamin  D  or  calcitriol  can  correct  impaired  calcium  absorption. 
Increased FGF23 levels are seen already during the early CKD stages 
and have been reported to correlate with kidney disease progression, 
increased mortality, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Strategies involv-
ing  different  oral  phosphate  binders  have  therefore  been  pursued  to 
lower intestinal phosphate absorption early during the course of kidney 
disease and to thereby lower FGF23 levels. However, these approaches 
have  been  largely  disappointing.  Furthermore,  there  is  concern  as  to 
whether supplementation with activated vitamin D analogues increases 
further  the  circulating  FGF23  levels  and  their  “off-target”  effects  in 
CKD patients.

3188 TREATMENT

Chronic Kidney Disease

Therapy of CKD (Chap. 311) involves appropriate management of 
patients prior to dialysis and adjustment of regimens once dialysis 
is initiated. Attention should be paid to restriction of phosphate in 
the  diet;  avoidance  of  aluminum-containing  phosphate-binding 
antacids; provision of an adequate calcium intake by mouth, usu-
ally  1–2  g/d;  and  supplementation  with  0.25–1  μg/d  calcitriol  or 
other activated forms of vitamin D. The aim of therapy is to restore 
normal calcium balance to prevent osteomalacia and severe second-
ary  hyperparathyroidism  (it  is  usually  recommended  to  maintain 
PTH levels between 100 and 300 pg/mL) and, in light of evidence 
of  genetic  changes  and  monoclonal  outgrowths  of  parathyroid 
glands in CKD patients, to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism 
from  becoming  autonomous  hyperparathyroidism.  Reduction  of 
hyperphosphatemia  and  restoration  of  normal  intestinal  calcium 
absorption  by  calcitriol  can  improve  blood  calcium  levels  and 
reduce the manifestations of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Since 
adynamic bone disease can occur in association with low PTH lev-
els, it is important to avoid excessive suppression of the parathyroid 
glands  while  recognizing  the  beneficial  effects  of  controlling  the 
secondary  hyperparathyroidism.  These  patients  should  be  closely 
monitored with PTH assays that detect only the full-length or bio-
active PTH(1–84) to ensure that inactive, inhibitory PTH fragments 
are  not  measured.  Use  of  oral  phosphate-binding  agents  such  as 
sevelamer lower blood phosphate levels in ESKD, but their use in 
earlier CKD stages does not seem to be beneficial in lowering blood 
phosphate levels and to prevent the rise in FGF23.

VITAMIN  D  DEFICIENCY  DUE  TO  INADEQUATE  DIET  AND/OR  SUN-
LIGHT  Vitamin  D  deficiency  due  to  inadequate  intake  of  dairy 
products  enriched  with  vitamin  D,  lack  of  vitamin  supplementation, 
and reduced sunlight exposure in the elderly, particularly during win-
ter  in  northern  latitudes,  is  more  common  in  the  United  States  than 
previously  recognized.  Biopsies  of  bone  in  elderly  patients  with  hip 
fracture (documenting osteomalacia) and abnormal levels of vitamin 
D metabolites, PTH, calcium, and phosphate indicate that vitamin D 
deficiency may occur in as many as 25% of elderly patients, particularly 
in northern latitudes in the United States. Concentrations of 25(OH)
D are low or low-normal in these patients. Quantitative histomorpho-
metric analysis of bone biopsy specimens from such individuals reveals 
widened osteoid seams consistent with osteomalacia (Chap. 409). PTH 
hypersecretion  compensates  for  the  tendency  for  the  blood  calcium 
to  fall  but  also  increases  renal  phosphate  excretion  and  thus  causes 
osteomalacia.

Treatment involves adequate replacement with vitamin D and cal-
cium  until  the  deficiencies  are  corrected.  Severe  hypocalcemia  rarely 
occurs  in  moderately  severe  vitamin  D  deficiency  of  the  elderly,  but 
vitamin D deficiency must be considered in the differential diagnosis 
of mild hypocalcemia.

Mild  hypocalcemia,  secondary  hyperparathyroidism,  severe  hypo-
phosphatemia, and a variety of nutritional deficiencies occur with gas-
trointestinal diseases. Hepatocellular dysfunction can lead to reduction 
in  25(OH)D  levels,  as  in  portal  or  biliary  cirrhosis  of  the  liver,  and 
malabsorption of vitamin D and its metabolites, including 1,25(OH)2D, 
may  occur  in  a  variety  of  bowel  diseases,  hereditary  or  acquired. 
Hypocalcemia itself can lead to steatorrhea, due to deficient produc-
tion of pancreatic enzymes and bile salts. Depending on the disorder, 
vitamin  D  or  its  metabolites  can  be  given  parenterally,  guaranteeing 
adequate blood levels of active metabolites.

DEFECTIVE  VITAMIN  D  METABOLISM  •	 Anticonvulsant  Therapy  Anti-
convulsant therapy with any of several agents induces acquired vitamin 
D  deficiency  by  increasing  the  conversion  of  vitamin  D  to  inactive 
compounds and/or causing resistance to its action. The more marginal 
the  vitamin  D  intake  in  the  diet,  the  more  likely  that  anticonvulsant 
therapy will lead to abnormal mineral and bone metabolism.

Vitamin  D–Dependent  Rickets  Type  I  Vitamin  D–dependent  rickets  type  I, 
previously  termed  pseudo-vitamin  D–resistant  rickets,  is  caused  by 
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the gene encod-
ing 25(OH)D-1α-hydroxylase. It differs from true vitamin D–resistant 
rickets  (vitamin  D–dependent  rickets  type  II,  see  below)  in  that  it  is 
typically less severe and the biochemical and radiographic abnormal-
ities  can  be  readily  reversed  with  physiologic  doses  of  the  vitamin’s 
active  metabolite,  1,25(OH)2D  (Chap.  409).  Clinical  features  include 
hypocalcemia,  often  with  tetany  or  convulsions;  hypophosphatemia 
due  to  secondary  hyperparathyroidism;  and  thus,  osteomalacia  and 
increased levels of alkaline phosphatase.

Vitamin  D–Dependent  Rickets  Type  II  Vitamin  D–dependent  rickets  type  II 
results from end-organ resistance to the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D. 
The  clinical  features  resemble  those  of  the  type  I  disorder  and 
include  hypocalcemia,  hypophosphatemia,  secondary  hyperparathy-
roidism,  and  rickets  but  also  partial  or  total  alopecia.  Plasma  levels 
of 1,25(OH)2D are elevated, in keeping with the refractoriness of the 
end-organs.  This  disorder  is  caused  by  homozygous  or  compound 
heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor; 
treatment requires regular, usually nocturnal calcium infusions, which 
normalize PTH levels, thus reducing urinary phosphate excretion and 
thereby  improving  rickets  and  thus  growth,  but  do  not  restore  hair 
growth (Chap. 409).

PSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM  PHP  refers  to  a  group  of  distinct 
inherited disorders. Patients affected by PHP type Ia (PHP1A) develop 
symptoms  and  signs  of  hypocalcemia  in  association  with  distinctive 
skeletal and developmental defects, referred to as Albright’s hereditary 
osteodystrophy  (AHO).  The  hypocalcemia  is  due  to  a  deficient  PTH 
response in the proximal renal tubules, probably leading to insufficient 
1,25(OH)2D production and thus impaired intestinal calcium absorp-
tion. Furthermore, PTH resistance in this portion of the kidney impairs 
urinary phosphate excretion, thus leading to elevated serum phosphate 
levels.  Patients  affected  by  PHP  type  Ib  (PHP1B)  also  present  with 
hypocalcemia  and  hyperphosphatemia  but  less  frequently  with  obvi-
ous AHO features. In response to the hypocalcemia observed in either 
disorder, PTH levels increase, leading to parathyroid hyperplasia and, 
in  some  cases,  to  autonomous  PTH  secretion.  Studies,  both  clinical 
and basic, have clarified some aspects of these disorders, including the 
variable  clinical  spectrum,  the  pathophysiology,  the  genetic  defects, 
and their mode of inheritance.

A working classification of the various PHP forms is given in Table 
410-6.  The  classification  scheme  is  based  on  the  signs  of  ineffective 
PTH action (low calcium and high phosphate), low or normal urinary 
cyclic  AMP  response  to  exogenous  PTH,  the  presence  or  absence  of 
AHO, and assays to measure the concentration of the Gsα subunit of 
the adenylate cyclase enzyme. Using these criteria, there are four types: 
PHP  types  Ia  and  Ib  (PHP1A  and  PHP1B);  pseudopseudohypopara-
thyroidism  (PPHP),  and  PHP  type  II  (PHP2).  Another  classification 
has been proposed recently, which is being debated.

PHP1A and PHP1B  Individuals with PHP type I (PHP1), the most com-
mon of the disorders, show deficient urinary cyclic AMP excretion in 
response to administration of exogenous PTH. Patients with PHP1 are 
divided into PHP1A and PHP1B. Patients with PHP1A show evidence 
for AHO and reduced amounts of Gsα protein/activity, as determined 
in  readily  accessible  tissues  such  as  erythrocytes,  lymphocytes,  or 
fibroblasts. Only some PHP1B patients show typically AHO features, 
but  they  usually  have  normal  Gsα  activity.  PHP1C,  sometimes  listed 
as  a  third  form  of  PHP1,  is  really  a  variant  of  PHP1A,  although  the 
mutant Gsα shows normal activity in certain in vitro assays.

Most  patients  who  have  PHP1A  reveal  characteristic  features  of 
AHO,  which  consist  of  short  stature,  early-onset  obesity,  round  face, 
obesity,  skeletal  anomalies  (brachydactyly),  intellectual  impairment, 
and/or heterotopic calcifications. Patients have low calcium and high 
phosphate levels, as with true hypoparathyroidism. PTH levels, how-
ever, are elevated, reflecting resistance to hormone action. In addition, 
hormonal resistance is observed at other Gsα-coupled receptors, partic-
ularly at the TSH receptor, leading to elevated levels of this hormone.

Amorphous  deposits  of  calcium  and  phosphate  are  found  in  the 
basal  ganglia.  The  typical  shortening  of  metacarpal  and  metatarsal 
bones is caused by premature closing of the epiphyses and is probably 
a  particularly  sensitive  sign  of  overall  advanced  skeletal  maturation 
resulting in adult short stature.
INHERITANCE AND GENETIC DEFECTS  Multiple defects at the GNAS 
locus have now been identified in PHP1A, PHP1B, and PPHP patients. 
This  gene,  which  is  located  on  chromosome  20q13.3,  encodes  the 
α-subunit  of  the  stimulatory  G  protein  (Gsα),  among  other  products 
(see below). Mutations involving the GNAS exons encoding Gsα, which 
are  the  cause  of  PHP1A  and  PPHP,  include  abnormalities  at  splice 
junctions, point mutations, insertions, and/or deletions that all result 
in a Gsα protein with defective function, resulting in a 50% reduction 
of in vitro Gsα activity in erythrocytes or other cells. While PHP1A is 
caused by inactivating Gsα mutations on the maternal allele, PPHP is 
caused by the same or similar mutations on the paternal GNAS allele  
(Fig.  410-7).  The  Gsα  transcript  is  biallelically  expressed  in  most 
tissues;  however,  expression  from  paternal  allele  is  silenced  through 
as-of-yet-unknown  mechanisms  in  some  tissues,  including  proximal 
renal  tubules,  thyroid,  and  pituitary.  Consequently,  inheritance  of  a 
molecular  defect  involving  the  paternal  exons  encoding  Gsα  has  no 
implications with regard to hormone function, while inactivating Gsα 
mutations involving the maternal GNAS allele lead to little or no Gsα 
protein in these tissues (Chap. 466). Thus, females affected by either 
PHP1A  or  PPHP  will  have  offspring  with  PHP1A,  if  these  children 
inherit  the  allele  carrying  the  GNAS  mutation;  in  contrast,  if  the 
mutant allele is inherited from a male affected by either disorder, the 
offspring will exhibit PPHP. However, patients affected by either disor-
der develop some but not all AHO features, making it likely that Gsα 
haploinsufficiency occurs during embryonic or postnatal development.
The complex mechanisms that control the GNAS gene contributed 
particularly  to  challenges  involved  in  unraveling  the  pathogenesis  of 
PHP1B. Analysis of families in which multiple members are affected 
by PHP1B, as well as studies of the complex parent-specific methyla-
tion of four regions within the complex GNAS locus, revealed that the 
autosomal dominant forms of PHP1B (AD-PHP1B) are caused either 
by  microdeletions,  duplications,  or  inversions  within  or  upstream  of 
the GNAS locus. These genetic mutations are associated with a loss of 
DNA methylation at one or several loci on the maternal GNAS allele 
(Table  410-6).  These  abnormalities  in  methylation  silence  maternal 
Gsα expression, thus leading in the proximal renal tubules—where Gsα 
appears  to  be  expressed  predominantly  from  the  maternal  allele—to 
PTH resistance. While most cases of AD-PHP1B are by now resolved 
at the molecular level, the genetic defect responsible for the sporadic 
variant  of  PHP1B  (sporPHP1B),  the  most  frequent  form  of  PHP1B, 
remains  to  be  defined,  except  for  those  sporPHP1B  cases  that  are 
caused  by  paternal  uniparental  isodisomy/heterodisomy  of  chromo-
some 20q (patUPD20q).

PHP1B patients, who rarely develop an AHO phenotype as severe 
as  in  PHP1A,  develop  hypocalcemia  and  hyperphosphatemia  caused 
by PTH resistance and thus elevated PTH levels. The previously used 

Ellsworth-Howard test to assess the presence or absence of hormone 
resistance  is  used  much  less  frequently,  largely  because  of  routinely 
available  sensitive  PTH  assays  (Table  410-6).  As  for  PHP1A,  these 
endocrine  abnormalities  become  apparent  only  if  disease-causing 
mutations are inherited maternally. Bone responsiveness may be exces-
sive rather than blunted in PHP1B (and in PHP1A) patients, based on 
case  reports  that  have  emphasized  an  osteitis  fibrosa–like  pattern  in 
several PHP1B patients. Some patients present with PTH resistance in 
the absence of AHO features and without GNAS methylation changes; 
it  remains  unclear  why  this  PHP  variant  readily  resolves  upon  treat-
ment with vitamin D supplements.

PHP2 refers to patients with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, 
who have normal urinary cyclic AMP excretion, but an impaired uri-
nary phosphaturic response to PTH. In one PHP2 variant, referred to as 
acrodysostosis with hormonal resistance, patients have a heterozygous

FIGURE 410-7  Paternal imprinting of renal parathyroid hormone (PTH) resistance 
(GNAS gene for Gs` subunit) in pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP1A and PHP1B). 
An impaired excretion of urinary cyclic AMP and phosphate is observed in patients 
with  PHP  type  I.  In  the  renal  cortex,  there  is  selective  silencing  of  paternal  Gsα 
expression; consequently, mutations involving the maternal GNAS exons encoding 
Gsα or loss of methylation at GNAS exon A/B leads to reduced or completely absent 
Gsα  protein  in  this  portion  of  the  kidney.  The  disease  becomes  manifest  only  in 
patients who inherit the defective gene from an obligate female carrier (left). If a 
genetic  defect  involving  GNAS  exons  encoding  Gsα  is  inherited  from  an  obligate 
male carrier of the mutation (PHP1A or PPHP patient), no biochemical abnormality 
is encountered, and the administration of PTH causes an appropriate increase in 
the urinary cyclic AMP and phosphate concentration (pseudoPHP [PPHP]; right). 
Both patterns of inheritance lead to some but not all features of Albright’s hereditary 
osteodystrophy  (AHO),  most  likely  because  of  haploinsufficiency;  for  example, 
Gsα  protein  derived  from  both  parental  GNAS  alleles  must  be  active  for  normal 
bone  development.  Maternal  inheritance  of  a  mutation  (deletion,  duplication,  or 
inversion within or upstream of the GNAS locus) causes AD-PHP1B, while paternal 
inheritance does not lead to any detectable abnormality.

3190 defect  in  the  regulatory  subunit  of  PKA  (PRKAR1A)  that  mediates 
the response to PTH distal to cyclic AMP production. Acrodysostosis 
without or with only mild hormonal resistance can be caused by hete-
rozygous mutations in the cyclic AMP–selective phosphodiesterase 4D. 
In  patients  with  one  variant  of  acrodysostosis  that  is  associated  with 
hypertension, it was shown to be caused by heterozygous phosphodi-
esterase 3A mutations.

The  diagnosis  of  these  hormone-resistant  states  can  usually  be 
made when there is a positive family history for signs and symptoms 
of hypocalcemia with or without AHO features. In both categories—
PHP1A  and  PHP1B—serum  PTH  levels  are  elevated,  particularly 
when  patients  start  to  experience  hypocalcemia  during  childhood. 
However,  patients  with  PHP1B  or  PHP2  without  skeletal  findings 
present only with hypocalcemia and high PTH levels, as evidence for 
hormone  resistance.  In  PHP1A  and  PHP1B,  the  response  of  urinary 
cyclic AMP to the administration of exogenous PTH is blunted. The 
diagnosis of PHP2, in the absence of acrodysostosis, is more complex, 
and vitamin D deficiency must be excluded before such a diagnosis can 
be entertained.

TREATMENT
Pseudohypoparathyroidism

Treatment of PHP is similar to that of hypoparathyroidism, except 
that calcium and activated vitamin D analogues are usually given 
at  higher  doses  to  maintain  blood  calcium  levels  within  the  nor-
mal range and PTH levels in the upper end of normal or slightly 
elevated. Patients with PHP1 show no PTH resistance in the distal 
tubules—hence, urinary calcium clearance is typically reduced, and 
these individuals are not at risk of developing nephrocalcinosis, as 
are patients with hypoparathyroidism, unless overtreatment occurs, 
for  example,  after  the  completion  of  pubertal  development  and 
skeletal mutation, when calcium and 1,25(OH)2D treatment should 
be reduced. Variability in response makes it necessary to establish 
the optimal regimen for each patient.

PTH Overwhelmed  Occasionally, loss of calcium from the ECF is 
so severe that PTH cannot compensate. Such situations include acute 
pancreatitis and severe, acute hyperphosphatemia, often in association 
with renal failure, conditions in which there is rapid efflux of calcium 
from  the  ECF.  Severe  hypocalcemia  can  occur  quickly;  PTH  rises  in 
response to hypocalcemia but does not return blood calcium to normal.
SEVERE,  ACUTE  HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA  Severe  hyperphosphatemia 
is associated with extensive tissue damage or cell destruction (Chap. 
409). The combination of increased release of phosphate from muscle 
and  impaired  ability  to  excrete  phosphorus  because  of  renal  failure 
causes  moderate  to  severe  hyperphosphatemia,  the  latter  causing 
calcium  loss  from  the  blood  and  mild  to  moderate  hypocalcemia. 
Hypocalcemia is usually reversed with tissue repair and restoration of 
renal function as phosphorus and creatinine values return to normal. 
There may even be a mild hypercalcemic period in the oliguric phase of 
renal function recovery. This sequence, severe hypocalcemia followed 
by  mild  hypercalcemia,  reflects  widespread  deposition  of  calcium  in 
muscle  and  subsequent  redistribution  of  some  of  the  calcium  to  the 
ECF after phosphate levels return to normal.

Other  causes  of  hyperphosphatemia  include  hypothermia,  mas-
sive  hepatic  failure,  and  hematologic  malignancies,  either  because  of 
high  cell  turnover  of  malignancy  or  because  of  cell  destruction  by 
chemotherapy.

TREATMENT
Severe, Acute Hyperphosphatemia

Treatment  is  directed  toward  lowering  of  blood  phosphate  by  the 
administration of phosphate-binding antacids or dialysis. Although 

calcium  replacement  may  be  necessary  if  hypocalcemia  is  severe 
and  symptomatic,  calcium  administration  during  the  hyperphos-
phatemic period tends to increase extraosseous calcium deposition 
and aggravate tissue damage. The levels of 1,25(OH)2D may be low 
during the hyperphosphatemic phase and return to normal during 
the oliguric phase of recovery.

OSTEITIS  FIBROSA  AFTER  PARATHYROIDECTOMY  Severe  hypocalce-
mia after parathyroid surgery is rare now that osteitis fibrosa cystica 
is an infrequent manifestation of hyperparathyroidism. When osteitis 
fibrosa cystica is severe, however, bone mineral deficits can be large. 
After  parathyroidectomy,  hypocalcemia  can  persist  for  days  if  cal-
cium  replacement  is  inadequate.  Treatment  may  require  parenteral 
administration of calcium; addition of calcitriol and oral calcium sup-
plementation is sometimes needed for weeks to a month or two until 
bone defects are filled (which, of course, is of therapeutic benefit in the 
skeleton), making it possible to discontinue parenteral calcium and/or 
reduce the amount.

Differential  Diagnosis  Care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  true 
hypocalcemia is present; in addition, acute transient hypocalcemia can 
be a manifestation of a variety of severe, acute illnesses, as discussed 
above. Chronic hypocalcemia, however, can usually be ascribed to a few 
disorders associated with absent or ineffective PTH. Important clinical 
criteria include the duration of the illness, signs or symptoms of asso-
ciated disorders, and the presence of features that suggest a hereditary 
abnormality. A nutritional history can be helpful in recognizing a low 
intake of vitamin D and calcium in the elderly, and a history of exces-
sive alcohol intake may suggest magnesium deficiency.

Hypoparathyroidism and PHP are typically lifelong illnesses, usually 
(but  not  always)  appearing  by  adolescence;  hence,  a  recent  onset  of 
hypocalcemia in an adult is more likely due to nutritional deficiencies, 
CKD, or intestinal disorders that result in deficient or ineffective vita-
min D. Neck surgery, even long past, however, can be associated with 
a  delayed  onset  of  postoperative  hypoparathyroidism.  A  history  of 
seizure disorder raises the issue of anticonvulsive medication. Devel-
opmental  defects  may  point  to  the  diagnosis  of  PHP1A.  Rickets  and 
a  variety  of  neuromuscular  syndromes  and  deformities  may  indicate 
ineffective vitamin D action, either due to defects in vitamin D metab-
olism or to vitamin D deficiency.

A  pattern  of  low  calcium  with  high  phosphorus  in  the  absence  of 
renal  failure  or  massive  tissue  destruction  almost  invariably  means 
hypoparathyroidism  or  PHP.  A  low  calcium  and  low  phosphorus  pat-
tern  points  to  absent  or  ineffective  vitamin  D,  thereby  impairing  the 
action of PTH on calcium metabolism (but not phosphate clearance). 
The relative ineffectiveness of PTH in calcium homeostasis in vita-
min  D  deficiency,  anticonvulsant  therapy,  gastrointestinal  disorders, 
and  hereditary  defects  in  vitamin  D  metabolism  leads  to  secondary 
hyperparathyroidism  as  a  compensation.  The  excess  PTH  on  renal 
tubule phosphate transport accounts for renal phosphate wasting and 
hypophosphatemia.

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolism411 Osteoporosis

Robert Lindsay, Blossom Samuels

Osteoporosis,  a  condition  characterized  by  decreased  bone  strength, 
is  prevalent  among  postmenopausal  women  but  also  occurs  in  both 
women and men as a function of age and with underlying conditions 
or major risk factors associated with loss of bone mass. Its chief clin-
ical manifestations are vertebral and hip fractures, although fractures 
can occur at almost any skeletal site. Osteoporosis affects >10 million 
individuals in the United States, but only a proportion are diagnosed 
and treated.

DEFINITION
Osteoporosis  is  defined  as  a  reduction  in  the  strength  of  bone  that 
leads  to  an  increased  risk  of  fractures.  Loss  of  bone  tissue  causes 
deterioration  in  skeletal  microarchitecture,  and  thus,  the  process  of 
bone loss causes a greater detriment to bone strength than might be 
appreciated  from  the  simple  measure  of  bone  “density.”  The  World 
Health  Organization  (WHO)  operationally  defined  osteoporosis  as  a 
bone density that falls 2.5 standard deviations (SDs) or more below the 
mean for young healthy adults of the same sex and race—also referred 
to as a T-score of –2.5. Postmenopausal women at the lower end of the 
young normal range (a T-score <–1.0) are defined as having low bone 
density and may be at increased risk of osteoporosis. Although fracture 
risk is lower in this group, >50% of fractures among postmenopausal 
women, including hip fractures, occur in those with low bone density 
as the numerical size of that population is larger than the group with 
bone density osteoporosis. As a consequence, clinical assessment has 
evolved  to  include  an  estimate  of  the  risk  of  fracture,  incorporating 
bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  with  age,  gender,  and  other  clinical 
risk  factors  to  allow  a  calculated  10-year  risk  of  hip  or  major  osteo-
porosis-related  fracture.  This  has  evolved  into  a  second  definition  of 
osteoporosis  with  cut  points  for  intervention  that  are  variable  across 
different geographies.

Osteoporosis-related fractures are defined as fractures of any bone 
in adults that occur in the setting of trauma less than or equal to a fall 
from  standing  height,  with  the  exceptions  of  fingers,  toes,  face,  and 
skull. However, in individuals thought to be at risk of osteoporosis, any 
traumatic fracture must be regarded as possibly indicative of an under-
lying skeletal problem, raising consideration of further evaluation.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
In the United States, as many as 10.8 million women and 2.5 million 
men  have  osteoporosis  (BMD  T-score  <–2.5  at  lumbar  spine,  total 
hip,  or  femoral  neck).  This  does  not  include  additional  people  who 
present with an osteoporosis-related fracture but with low bone mass 
(T-score <–1 to –2.5). It is estimated that 2 million osteoporosis-related 
fractures occur each year in the United States at a cost of $19 billion, 
a  problem  that  will  increase  as  the  population  ages  with  an  estimate 
of 3 million fractures and $25 billion in costs by 2025. The failure to 
identify the first fracture and intervene is estimated to cost $6 billion to 
Medicare alone for secondary fractures. About 40 million individuals 
have low bone mass (T-score <–1 to –2.5) that potentially puts them 
at increased of fracture and of developing osteoporosis. Osteoporosis 
is  mostly  age  related,  as  bone  tissue  is  lost  progressively.  In  women, 
the  loss  of  ovarian  function  at  menopause  (typically  around  age  50) 
precipitates rapid bone loss such that most women meet the diagnostic 
criterion  for  osteoporosis  by  age  70–80.  As  the  population  ages,  the 
number of individuals with osteoporosis and fractures rises. As many 
of the fractures defined as related to osteoporosis occur in individuals 
with low bone mass, identification of those at high risk of facture and 
their evaluation and treatment have become important issues in clini-
cal management.

The  epidemiology  of  fractures  follows  the  trend  for  loss  of  bone 
density, with most fractures, especially those of the hip and vertebrae,

showing exponential increases with advancing age (Fig. 411-1). Life-
time  osteoporotic  fracture  risk  for  a  Caucasian  woman  who  reaches 
the age of 50 is ~50%, and corresponding risk for a 50-year-old man 
is ~25%. Recent data suggest that fractures are increasing despite the 
availability of effective medications. This may be related to the failure 
to evaluate patients who fall into a high-risk group for underlying skel-
etal problems leading to fractures.

About  300,000  hip  fractures  occur  each  year  in  the  United  States, 
almost all requiring hospital admission and emergency surgical inter-
vention.  The  lifetime  probability  that  a  50-year-old  white  individual 
will have a hip fracture is 14% for women and 5% for men; the risk for 
African Americans is about half of those rates, and the risk for Asians 
and nonblack Hispanics appears similar to that for Caucasians. Surgi-
cal  intervention  for  hip  fractures  is  associated  with  a  high  incidence 
of mortality and morbidity, with 20–25% of patients dying in the year 
following  the  injury  with  higher  mortality  rates  among  males  and 
African Americans. About 30% of survivors require long-term care (at 
least  temporarily),  and  many  never  regaining  the  independence  that 
they had prior to the fracture.

There  are  ~500,000  symptomatic  vertebral  fractures  per  year  in 
the  United  States,  but  >1,000,000  vertebral  fractures  may  actually 
occur yearly since only about one-third are recognized clinically at the 
time  of  the  event.  Many  of  these  initially  “silent”  vertebral  fractures 
are  identified  incidentally  during  radiography  for  other  purposes  
(Fig.  411-2).  Even  when  asymptomatic,  these  vertebral  fractures  are 
a  major  sign  of  skeletal  fragility  and  may  carry  the  same  predictive 
value for subsequent fracture. Vertebral fractures rarely require hospi-
talization but are associated with long-term morbidity and an increase 
in mortality. The occurrence of the first fracture increases the risk of 
further fractures, especially in the first year after clinically evident frac-
tures. The consequence is height loss (often of several inches), kypho-
sis, and secondary pain and discomfort related to altered biomechanics 
of the back. Thoracic fractures can be associated with restrictive lung 
disease, whereas lumbar fractures are associated with abdominal symp-
toms that include distention, early satiety, and constipation.

Approximately  400,000  wrist  fractures  occur  in  the  United  States 
each  year.  Fractures  of  other  bones  (including  ~150,000  pelvic  frac-
tures  and  >100,000  proximal  humerus  fractures)  also  occur  with 
osteoporosis. Although some fractures result from major trauma, the 
threshold  for  fracture  is  reduced  in  osteoporotic  bone  (Fig.  411-3). 
The  occurrence  of  a  traumatic  fracture  in  someone  at  risk  of  osteo-
porosis in the skeleton necessitates evaluation for reduced bone mass 
and, if appropriate, intervention to reduce future fracture risk. Fewer 
than 10% of these patients are currently investigated for osteoporosis 
within 6 months of a new fracture. In addition to reduced bone density

with advancing age, there are a number of risk factors for fracture; the 
common ones are summarized in Table 411-1. Prior fractures, a family 
history  of  osteoporosis-related  fractures  (particularly  hip  fractures), 
low  body  weight,  cigarette  consumption,  and  excessive  alcohol  con-
sumption are all independent predictors of fracture. Chronic diseases 
with inflammatory components that increase skeletal remodeling, such 
as rheumatoid arthritis, increase the risk of osteoporosis, as do diseases 
associated with malabsorption. Chronic diseases that increase the risk 
of falling or frailty, including dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and multi-
ple sclerosis, also increase fracture risk (Table 411-1). Many other risk 
factors  for  osteoporosis  have  been  described  including  air  pollution, 
triclosan,  gastric  bypass  surgery,  diabetes,  cerebrovascular  accidents, 
dementia (including Alzheimer’s), the death of a spouse, and depres-
sion and its treatment, to name a few.

The increasing frailty with age is a potent risk factor for fracture, as 

is sensory inattention (e.g., walking while looking at mobile phone).

In the United States and Europe, osteoporosis-related fractures are 
more common among women than men, presumably due to a lower 
peak bone mass as well as postmenopausal bone loss in women. How-
ever, this gender difference in bone density and age-related increase in 
hip fractures is not as apparent in some other cultures, possibly due to 
genetics, physical activity level, or diet.

Fractures are themselves risk factors for future fractures (Table 411-1). 
Vertebral fractures increase the risk of other vertebral fractures as well 
as fractures of the peripheral skeleton such as the hip and wrist. Wrist 
fractures also increase the risk of vertebral and hip fractures. Among 
individuals aged >50, any fracture except those of the fingers, toes, face, 
and  skull  should  be  considered  as  potentially  related  to  osteoporosis

regardless  of  the  specific  circumstances  of  the  fracture.  Osteoporotic 
bone  is  more  likely  to  fracture  than  is  normal  bone  at  any  level  of 
trauma, and a fracture in a person aged >50 should trigger evaluation 
for osteoporosis. This often does not occur since postfracture care is 
fragmented. Recent attempts to coordinate care using a fracture liaison 
health care provider to guide patients through the system and ensure 
their evaluation and treatment for osteoporosis may improve care but 
is more difficult to do in the open medical care systems in the United 
States. In countries with single-payor systems, that approach does seem 
to be effective, as is also the case in closed health care systems in the 
United States.

The risk for future fracture after a first fracture is not linear. Highest 
risk occurs within the first 2 years after the first fracture. A recent large 
Medicare database study indicated that almost 20% of women will have 
a second fracture within 2 years after the first. Risk diminishes to less 
than half of that rate in the subsequent 3 years and declines to baseline 
thereafter for most fracture types, although risk after a vertebral or hip 
fracture may persist.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 ■ BONE REMODELING
Osteoporosis results from bone loss due to age-related changes in bone 
remodeling  as  well  as  extrinsic  and  intrinsic  factors  that  exaggerate 
this process. These changes may be superimposed on a low peak bone 
mass.  Consequently,  understanding  the  bone  remodeling  process  is 
fundamental  to  understanding  both  the  pathophysiology  of  osteo-
porosis  (Chap.  409)  and  the  effects  of  pharmacologic  intervention. 
During  growth,  the  skeleton  increases  in  size  by  linear  growth  and 
by  apposition  of  new  bone  tissue  on  the  outer  surfaces  of  the  cortex 
(Fig. 411-4). The latter process is called modeling, a process that also 
allows the long bones to adapt in shape to the stresses placed on them. 
Increased sex hormone production at puberty is required for skeletal 
maturation, which reaches maximum mass and density in early adult-
hood. Recent data suggest that delayed puberty may be associated with 
low bone mass that persists into adulthood. The sexual dimorphism in 
skeletal size becomes obvious after puberty, although true bone density 
remains similar between the sexes. Nutrition and lifestyle also play an 
important role in growth, although genetic factors primarily determine 
peak skeletal mass and density.

Numerous genes control skeletal growth, peak bone mass, and body 
size, as well as skeletal structure and density. Heritability estimates of 
50–80%  for  bone  density  and  size  have  been  derived  on  the  basis  of 
twin studies. Though peak bone mass is often lower among individuals 
with a family history of osteoporosis, association studies of candidate 
genes (vitamin D receptors; type I collagen, estrogen receptors [ERs], 
and  interleukin  6  [IL-6];  and  insulin-like  growth  factor  I  [IGF-I]) 
and  bone  mass,  bone  turnover,  and  fracture  prevalence  have  been 
inconsistent. Linkage studies suggest that a genetic locus on chromo-
some 11 is associated with high bone mass. Families with high bone 
mass  and  without  much  apparent  age-related  bone  loss  have  been

shown  to  have  a  point  mutation  in  LRP5,  a  low-density  lipoprotein  
receptor–related  protein.  The  role  of  this  gene  in  the  general  pop-
ulation  is  not  clear,  although  a  nonfunctional  mutation  results  in  
osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, and LRP5 signaling appears to 
be  important  in  controlling  bone  formation.  Genome-wide  scans  for 
low bone mass suggest multiple genes are involved, many of which are 
also implicated also in control of body size.

In adults, bone remodeling, not modeling, is the principal metabolic 
skeletal  process.  Bone  remodeling  has  two  primary  functions:  (1)  to 
repair microdamage within the skeleton to maintain skeletal strength 
and ensure the relative youth of the skeleton and (2) to supply calcium 
when needed from the skeleton to maintain serum calcium. Remodel-
ing may be activated by microdamage to bone as a result of excessive 
or accumulated stress. Acute demands for calcium involve osteoclast-
mediated resorption as well as calcium transport by osteocytes. Chronic 
demands  for  calcium  can  result  in  secondary  hyperparathyroidism,

increased  bone  remodeling,  and  overall  loss  of  bone  tissue.  Bone 
remodeling  occurs  through  well-coordinated  activity  of  osteocytes, 
osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. Osteocytes are the terminal-differentiated 
cells  derived  from  osteoblasts  after  incorporation  into  newly  formed 
bone  tissue.  Osteoblasts  derive  from  mesenchymal  cell  lineage  and 
osteoclasts from monocyte/macrophage lineage. Remodeling sites are 
discrete units with osteoclasts initiating the process by removal of bone 
tissue  and  osteoblasts  synthesizing  new  organic  bone  that  becomes 
gradually mineralized.

Bone remodeling also is regulated by multiple hormones, including 
estrogens  (in  both  genders),  androgens,  vitamin  D,  and  parathyroid 
hormone  (PTH),  as  well  as  locally  produced  growth  factors,  such  as 
IGF-I,  transforming  growth  factor  β  (TGF-β),  PTH–related  peptide 
(PTHrP),  interleukins  (ILs),  prostaglandins,  and  members  of  the 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. These factors primarily mod-
ulate the rate at which new remodeling sites are activated, a process that 
results initially in bone resorption by osteoclasts, followed by a period 
of  repair  during  which  new  bone  tissue  is  synthesized  by  osteoblasts 
(Chap. 409). The cytokine responsible for communication between the 
osteoblasts, other marrow cells, and osteoclasts is receptor activator of 
nuclear factor-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL). RANKL, a member of the 
TNF family, is secreted by osteocytes, osteoblasts, and certain cells of 
the immune system. The osteoclast receptor for this protein is referred 
to  as  RANK.  Activation  of  RANK  by  RANKL  is  a  final  common 
path  in  osteoclast  development  and  activation.  A  humoral  decoy  for 
RANKL, also secreted by osteoblasts, is referred to as osteoprotegerin 
(Fig. 411-5). Modulation of osteoclast recruitment and activity appears 
to  be  related  to  the  interplay  among  these  three  factors.  Additional 
influences include nutrition (particularly calcium intake) and physical 
activity level. RANKL production is in part regulated by the canonical 
Wnt  signaling  pathway.  Wnt  activation  through  mechanical  loading 
or  by  hormonal  or  cytokine  factors  stimulates  bone  formation  by 
increasing formation and activity of osteoblasts and decreases RANKL 
secretion, which inhibits production and activity of osteoclasts. Scle-
rostin,  also  an  osteocyte  protein,  is  a  major  inhibitor  of  Wnt  activa-
tion  and  bone  formation.  Both  the  RANKL  and  Wnt  pathways  have 
become major targets for pharmacologic treatment of osteoporosis (see  
below).

In young adults, resorbed bone is replaced by an equal amount of 
new bone tissue. Thus, the mass of the skeleton remains constant after 
peak bone mass is achieved by the age of ~20 years. After age 30–45, 
however, the resorption and formation processes become imbalanced, 
and  resorption  exceeds  formation.  This  imbalance  may  begin  at  dif-
ferent ages, varies at different skeletal sites, and becomes exaggerated 
in women after menopause or any other cause of estrogen deficiency. 
Excessive  bone  loss  can  be  due  to  an  increase  in  osteoclastic  activity 
and/or  a  decrease  in  osteoblastic  activity.  In  addition,  an  increase  in 
remodeling activation frequency, and thus the number of remodeling 
sites, can magnify the small imbalance seen at each remodeling unit. 
Increased recruitment of bone remodeling sites produces a reversible 
reduction in bone tissue but also can result in permanent loss of tis-
sue  and  disrupted  skeletal  architecture,  with  the  imbalance  between 
resorption  and  formation  within  each  cycle.  In  trabecular  bone,  if 
the  osteoclasts  penetrate  trabeculae,  they  leave  no  template  for  new 
bone  formation  to  occur,  and  consequently,  rapid  bone  loss  ensues 
and  cancellous  connectivity  becomes  impaired.  A  higher  number 
of  remodeling  sites  increases  the  likelihood  of  this  event.  In  cortical 
bone,  increased  activation  of  remodeling  creates  more  porous  bone. 
The effect of this increased porosity on cortical bone strength may be 
modest  if  the  overall  diameter  of  the  bone  is  not  changed.  However, 
decreased  apposition  of  new  bone  on  the  periosteal  surface  coupled 
with  increased  endocortical  resorption  of  bone  decreases  the  biome-
chanical strength of long bones. Even a slight exaggeration in normal 
bone  loss  increases  the  risk  of  osteoporosis-related  fractures  because 
of  the  architectural  changes  that  occur,  and  osteoporosis  is  largely 
a  disease  of  disordered  skeletal  architecture,  although  currently  the 
only  clinical  tool  generally  available  (dual-energy  x-ray  absorptiom-
etry [DXA]) measures mass (an estimate of the mineral in bone) not 
architecture. Several tools are becoming available that may give more

insight into the architecture of the skeleton (including the trabecular 
bone score, a noninvasive addition to DXA).

 ■ CALCIUM NUTRITION
Peak bone mass may be impaired by inadequate calcium intake dur-
ing  growth  among  other  nutritional  factors  (calories,  protein,  and 
other minerals), leading to increased risk of osteoporosis later in life. 
During  the  adult  phase  of  life,  insufficient  calcium  intake  contrib-
utes  to  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  and  an  increase  in  the  rate 
of  bone  remodeling  to  assist  in  maintaining  normal  serum  calcium 
levels. PTH stimulates the hydroxylation of vitamin D in the kidney, 
leading to increased levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] 
and enhanced gastrointestinal calcium absorption. PTH also reduces 
renal  calcium  loss.  Although  these  are  appropriate  compensatory 
homeostatic  responses  for  adjusting  calcium  economy,  the  long-
term  effects  are  detrimental  to  the  skeleton  because  the  increased 
remodeling  rates  and  the  ongoing  imbalance  between  resorption 
and formation at remodeling sites combine to accelerate loss of bone  
tissue.

Total daily calcium intakes <400 mg are detrimental to the skeleton, 
and  intakes  in  the  range  of  600–800  mg,  which  is  about  the  average 
intake  among  adults  in  the  United  States,  are  also  probably  subopti-
mal.  The  recommended  daily  required  intake  of  1000–1200  mg  for 
adults accommodates population heterogeneity in controlling calcium 
balance  (Chap.  332).  Such  intakes  should  preferentially  come  from 
dietary sources, with supplements used only when dietary intakes fall 
short and cannot be modified easily. The supplement should be enough 
to  bring  total  intake  to  ~1200  mg/d.  Recent  studies  have  suggested 
that there may be differences in safety based on calcium source; high 
intakes primarily from supplement sources appear to result in a greater 
risk of renal stones and perhaps cardiovascular calcifications (although 
the  literature  is  inconsistent  and  controversial).  Increasing  calcium 
intake above this level does not improve calcium homeostasis or bone 
formation. Increasing calcium intake by itself will not prevent bone loss 
due to other factors (e.g., postmenopausal status)

 ■ VITAMIN D
(See  also  Chap.  409)  Severe  vitamin  D  deficiency  causes  rickets  in 
children and osteomalacia in adults. However, vitamin D insufficiency 
(circulating  levels  of  25-hydroxyvitamin  D  [25(OH)D]  that  may  be 
inadequate  but  above  the  level  that  results  in  rickets)  may  be  more 
prevalent  than  previously  thought,  particularly  among  individuals  at 
increased  risk  such  as  the  elderly;  those  living  in  northern  latitudes; 
and individuals with poor nutrition, obesity, malabsorption, or chronic 
liver or renal disease. Dark-skinned individuals are also at high risk of 
vitamin D in the insufficiency range or lower, but African Americans 
have a low risk of osteoporosis, with better calcium homeostasis than 
Caucasians.

Although  there  is  considerable  controversy  about  overall  optimal 
health targets for serum 25(OH)D, there is evidence that for optimal 
skeletal  health,  serum  25(OH)D  should  be  >75  nmol/L  (30  ng/mL). 
To achieve this level for most adults requires skin exposure to sunlight 
(estimated to be exposure of face and arms for at least one-half hour 
each day) or an intake of at least 800–1000 units/d, or even higher in 
individuals with risk factors (as above).

Vitamin  D  insufficiency  leads  to  compensatory  secondary  hyper-
parathyroidism  and  is  an  important  risk  factor  for  osteoporosis  and 
fractures.  Some  studies  have  shown  that  >50%  of  inpatients  on  a 
general  medical  service  exhibit  biochemical  features  of  vitamin  D 
deficiency, including increased levels of PTH and alkaline phosphatase 
and lower levels of ionized calcium. Among those living in northern 
latitudes, vitamin D levels decline during the winter months without 
supplementation. This is associated with seasonal bone loss, reflecting 
increased bone turnover. Even among healthy ambulatory individuals, 
mild vitamin D deficiency is increasing in prevalence. In part, this is 
due  to  decreased  exposure  to  sunlight  coupled  with  increased  use  of 
potent  sunscreens,  although  not  all  studies  suggest  that  sunscreens 
inhibit D synthesis in the skin. Treatment with vitamin D can return 
levels to normal (>75 μmol/L [30 ng/mL]) and prevent the associated 
increase  in  bone  remodeling,  bone  loss,  and  fractures.  Reduced  falls 
and  fracture  rates  also  have  been  documented  among  individuals  in 

HPIM21e_Part12_p2881-p3276.indd   3194

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismnorthern latitudes who have greater vitamin D intake and have higher 
25(OH)D levels (though one study suggested an increased fall risk with 
25[OH]D levels >70 ng/mL). Although vitamin D levels are suspected 
to affect risk and/or severity of other diseases, including cancers (col-
orectal, prostate, and breast), autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, 
cardiovascular  disease,  and  diabetes,  most  controlled  clinical  trials 
have not confirmed these effects. For most adults in the United States, 
supplements  of  1000–2000  IU/d  are  adequate  and  safe.  Recent  data 
suggesting  that  those  with  low  vitamin  D  levels  have  a  more  severe 
clinical  course  than  those  with  normal  vitamin  D  levels  have  added 
impetus to ensuring that vitamin D levels are normal in all adults, even 
though a cause-and-effect relationship has not been demonstrated.

 ■ ESTROGEN STATUS
Estrogen  deficiency  causes  bone  loss  by  two  distinct  but  interrelated 
mechanisms: (1) activation of new bone remodeling sites and (2) ini-
tiation or exaggeration of an imbalance between bone formation and 
resorption,  in  favor  of  the  latter.  The  change  in  activation  frequency 
causes a transient bone loss until a new steady state between resorption 
and formation is achieved. The remodeling imbalance, however, results 
in a permanent decrement in mass. In addition, the very presence of 
more  remodeling  sites  in  the  skeleton  increases  the  probability  that 
trabeculae will be penetrated, eliminating the template on which new 
bone can be formed and accelerating the loss of bony tissue. The con-
sequence is loss of skeletal architecture, particularly in trabecular bone, 
and it is possible that at any given bone density the risk of a fracture 
is  likely  to  be  greater  in  those  who  have  experienced  bone  loss  than 
in those for whom that level of bone mass represents normal. Recent 
addition  of  the  trabecular  bone  score  in  DXA  measurements  is  an 
attempt to capture these architectural changes.

The most common estrogen-deficient state is the cessation of ovar-
ian function at the time of menopause, which occurs on average at age 
51 (Chap. 395). Thus, with current life expectancy, an average woman 
will  spend  ~30  years  without  an  ovarian  supply  of  estrogen.  Breast 
cancer treatment with aromatase inhibitors is an increasingly common 
cause  of  even  more  severe  estrogen  deficiency.  The  mechanism  by 
which estrogen deficiency causes bone loss is summarized in Fig. 411-
5. Marrow cells (macrophages, monocytes, osteoclast precursors, mast 
cells) as well as bone cells (osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts) express 
both ERs (α and β). Loss of estrogen increases production of RANKL 
and reduces production of osteoprotegerin, increasing osteoclast for-
mation and recruitment. Estrogen also may play a role in determining 
the  life  span  of  bone  cells  by  controlling  the  rate  of  apoptosis.  Thus, 
in situations of estrogen deprivation, the life span of osteoblasts may 
be  decreased,  whereas  the  longevity  and  activity  of  osteoclasts  are 
increased.  The  rate  and  duration  of  bone  loss  after  menopause  are 
heterogeneous and unpredictable. Once surfaces are lost in cancellous 
bone, the rate of bone loss declines. In cortical bone, loss is slower but 
may continue for a longer time period.

Since remodeling is initiated at the surface of bone, it follows that 
trabecular bone—which has a considerably larger surface area (80% of 
the total) than cortical bone—will be affected preferentially by estro-
gen deficiency. Fractures occur earliest at sites where trabecular bone 
contributes most to bone strength; consequently, vertebral fractures are 
the most common early skeletal consequence of estrogen deficiency.

In males, estrogen may have an important role in regulation of bone 
remodeling. In an experiment in which males were rendered estrogen 
and androgen deficient, restoring estrogen supply reduced remodeling 
rate more than restoring androgen.

 ■ PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
Inactivity, such as prolonged bed rest or paralysis, results in significant 
bone  loss.  Concordantly,  athletes  have  higher  bone  mass  than  non-
athletes.  These  changes  in  skeletal  mass  are  most  marked  when  the 
stimulus begins during growth and before the age of puberty. Adults 
are less capable than children of increasing bone mass after restoration 
of  physical  activity.  Epidemiologic  data  support  the  beneficial  effects 
on the skeleton of chronic high levels of physical activity. Fracture risk 
is lower in rural communities and in countries where physical activity

is maintained into old age. However, when exercise is initiated during 
adult life, the effects of moderate exercise on the skeleton are modest, 
with a bone mass increase of 1–2% in short-term studies of <2 years’ 
duration. It is argued that more active individuals are less likely to fall 
and  are  more  capable  of  protecting  themselves  upon  falling,  thereby 
reducing fracture risk. Continuing physical activity into the later years 
appears to slow cognitive decline, another major reason for including 
exercise programs for the aging population.
 ■ CHRONIC DISEASES
Various genetic and acquired diseases are associated with an increase in 
the risk of osteoporosis (Table 411-2). Mechanisms that contribute to 
bone loss are unique for each disease and typically result from multiple 
factors, including nutrition, reduced physical activity levels, and factors 
that affect rates of bone remodeling. In most, but not all circumstances, 
the  primary  diagnosis  is  made  before  osteoporosis  presents  clini-
cally. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with an 
increased fracture risk, with increased risk at higher bone density than 
in the nondiabetic population. This may be due to differences in the 
chemical composition of bone tissue that is more brittle than normal, 
a predilection for conversion of precursors to adipose cells rather than 
osteoblasts, and the sequelae of diabetes that increase the risk of falls 
and injury.

Severe bone loss occurs in quadriplegic and paraplegic individuals 
below the level of the injury. The combination of loss of muscle func-
tion and innervation of both muscle and bone contributes to failure to 
recover mobility, which leads to a high fracture risk in those attempting 
to pursue athletic activities despite their primary diagnosis (e.g., wheel-
chair athletes). Bone loss also follows a stroke and is again dependent 
on the severity of the paralysis. The risk of fracture can be predicted by 
the FRAX (Fracture Risk Assessment) score and seems highest in the 
first year after stroke diagnosis. The increasing prevalence of transgen-
der and gender nonconforming individuals has prompted a guideline 
for evaluation of bone density in that population by the International 
Society of Clinical Densitometry published in 2019.

 ■ MEDICATIONS
A  large  number  of  medications  used  in  clinical  practice  have  poten-
tially detrimental effects on the skeleton (Table 411-3). Glucocorticoids 
are  the  most  common  cause  of  medication-induced  osteoporosis.  It 
is often not possible to determine the extent to which osteoporosis is 
related  to  glucocorticoid  treatment  or  to  other  factors,  as  the  effects 
of medication are superimposed on the effects of the primary disease, 
which  in  itself  may  be  associated  with  bone  loss  (e.g.,  rheumatoid 
arthritis).  Excessive  doses  of  thyroid  hormone  can  accelerate  bone 
remodeling and result in bone loss.

Other medications have less detrimental effects on the skeleton than 
pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids. Anticonvulsants are thought to 
increase  the  risk  of  osteoporosis,  although  many  affected  individuals 
have  concomitant  insufficiency  of  1,25(OH)2D,  as  some  anticonvul-
sants induce the cytochrome P450 system and vitamin D metabolism. 
Patients undergoing transplantation are at high risk for rapid bone loss 
and  fracture  not  only  from  glucocorticoids  but  also  from  treatment 
with  other  immunosuppressants  such  as  cyclosporine  and  tacrolimus 
(FK506). In addition, these patients often have underlying metabolic 
abnormalities such as hepatic or renal failure that predispose to bone 
loss.  Recently,  long-term  use  of  proton  pump  inhibitors  has  been 
shown  in  observational  studies  to  be  associated  with  a  higher  risk 
of  fracture.  Given  their  widespread  and  frequent  long-term  use,  the 
skeletal effect is important from a public health perspective and when 
reviewing risk for fracture in individuals.

Aromatase inhibitors, which potently block the aromatase enzyme 
that  converts  androgens  and  other  adrenal  precursors  to  estro-
gen, reduce circulating postmenopausal estrogen supply dramatically. 
These agents, which are used in various stages for breast cancer treat-
ment, also have been shown to have a detrimental effect on bone den-
sity and risk of fracture. Androgen deprivation therapies, used to treat 
men with prostate cancer, also result in rapid loss of bone and increased 
fracture risk. Various diabetes medications, including but not limited 
to thiazolidinediones, and antidepressants, including the selective sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors, increase risk of osteoporosis and fracture. It 
is difficult in some cases to separate the risk accrued by the underlying 
disease from that attributable to the medication. Thus, both depression 
and diabetes are risk factors for fracture by themselves.

 ■ SMOKING
Smoking produces detrimental effects on bone mass mediated directly 
by  toxic  effects  on  osteoblasts  or  indirectly  by  modifying  estrogen 
metabolism. On average, cigarette smokers reach menopause 1–2 years 
earlier than the general population. Cigarette smoking also produces 
secondary  effects  that  can  modulate  skeletal  status,  including  inter-
current respiratory and other illnesses, frailty, decreased exercise, poor 
nutrition,  and  the  need  for  additional  medications  (e.g.,  glucocorti-
coids for lung disease).

 ■ OTHER POTENTIAL FACTORS
In the past few years, a large number of potential risk factors for frac-
ture have been identified. These include excessive alcohol intake and 
other  drugs  of  abuse,  pollution,  use  of  triclosan,  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary disease, excess vitamin B, and hormonal therapies utilized 
among the transgender population.

DIAGNOSIS
 ■ MEASUREMENT OF BONE MASS
Several  noninvasive  techniques  are  available  for  estimating  skeletal 
mass  or  BMD.  They  include  single-energy  x-ray  absorptiometry 
(SXA),  DXA,  quantitative  computed  tomography  (CT),  and  ultra-
sound.  DXA  is  a  highly  accurate  x-ray  technique  that  has  become 
the standard for measuring bone density. Though it can be used for 
measurement in any skeletal site, clinical determinations usually are 
made of the lumbar spine and hip. DXA also can be used to measure 
the  wrist  total  body  bone  mass  and  body  composition.  Two  x-ray 
energies are used to estimate mineralized tissue, allowing for correc-
tion for attenuation through soft tissue. The mineral content is divided 
by bone area, which partially corrects for body and bone size. How-
ever,  this  correction  is  only  partial  since  DXA  is  a  two-dimensional 
scanning technique and cannot estimate the depth or posteroanterior 
length of the bone. Thus, small slim people tend to have lower than 
average BMD, a feature that is important in interpreting BMD mea-
surements. Bone spurs, which are common in osteoarthritis, tend to 
falsely increase bone density mostly of the spine and are a particular 
problem in measuring spine BMD in older individuals. Because DXA 
measurement devices are provided by two different manufacturers, the 
output varies in absolute terms. Consequently, it has become standard 
practice to relate the results to “normal” values by using T-scores (a 
T-score of 1 equals 1 SD), which compare individual results to those in 
a young adult population that is matched for race and sex. The mean 
value is given a score of zero and the range +2.5 to –2.5 (i.e., 2.5 SDs 
above  or  below  the  mean).  Z-scores  (also  SDs)  compare  individual 
results to those of an age and gender-matched reference population. 
Thus, a 60-year-old woman with a Z-score of –1 (1 SD below mean 
for age) has a T-score of –2.5 (2.5 SD below mean for a young control 
group)  (Fig.  411-6).  A  T-score  <–2.5  in  the  lumbar  spine,  femoral 
neck,  or  total  hip  has  been  defined  as  osteoporosis.  Although  the 
outputs  from  different  instruments  and,  more  importantly,  different 
manufacturers correlate well, different machines used over time may 
show changes in BMD that may be attributed to biological changes or 
simply the result of differences between machines. This is particularly 
true with measurements of the hip. Consequently, it is recommended 
that  serial  measurements  be  performed  on  the  same  machine  and 
preferably by the same technician.

As noted above, since >50% of fractures occur in individuals with 
low  bone  mass  (i.e.,  a  T-score  between  –1.0  and  –2.5),  it  is  usual  to 
report fracture risk in addition to BMD. To that end the absolute frac-
ture risk assessment tool FRAX often accompanies the report of bone 
density.  FRAX  estimates  include  age,  gender,  height,  weight,  fracture 
history, hip fracture in a parent, steroid use, rheumatoid arthritis, other 
secondary causes, and bone density of the femoral neck. The program 
then calculates the estimated risk over a 10-year time frame for major 
osteoporosis-related fractures (clinical spine, hip, wrist, and proximal 
humerus) as well as hip fracture.

CT can also be used to measure the spine and hip but is rarely used 
clinically,  in  part  because  the  radiation  exposure  and  cost  are  both

much higher than with DXA. High-resolution peripheral quantitative 
computed  tomography  (HR-pQCT)  can  be  used  to  measure  bone  in 
the  forearm  or  tibia  and  is  a  research  tool  that  provides  information 
on  skeletal  architecture  noninvasively.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging 
(MRI)  can  also  be  used  to  obtain  some  architectural  information  on 
the forearm and perhaps the hip but, again, is primarily a research tool 
at present.

Ultrasound  can  be  used  to  measure  bone  mass  by  calculating  the 
attenuation of the signal as it passes through bone or the speed with 
which  it  traverses  the  bone.  Although  the  ultrasound  technique  was 
purported to assess properties of bone other than mass (e.g., quality), 
this  has  not  been  confirmed.  Because  of  its  relatively  low  cost  and 
mobility, ultrasound bone density measurement is amenable for use as 
a screening procedure in stores or health fairs.

All  these  techniques  for  measuring  BMD  have  been  approved  by 
the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  on  the  basis  of  their 
capacity to predict fracture risk. The hip is the preferred site of mea-
surement in most individuals, since it allows prediction of hip fracture 
risk, the most important consequence of osteoporosis, better than any 
other  bone  density  measurement  site.  When  hip  measurements  are 
performed by DXA, the spine is usually measured at the same time. In 
younger individuals such as perimenopausal or early postmenopausal 
women, spine measurements may be a more sensitive indicator of bone 
loss. When the spine or hip is not measurable due to severe degenera-
tive spine disease or scoliosis or prior spine or hip surgery, BMD of the 
wrist is often measured.
 ■ INDICATIONS FOR BONE MASS MEASUREMENT
Several  clinical  guidelines  have  been  developed  for  the  use  of 
bone  densitometry  in  clinical  practice  (Table  411-4).  The  National 
Osteoporosis  Foundation  (NOF)  guidelines  recommend  bone  mass 
measurements  in  postmenopausal  women  who  have  one  or  more 
risk  factors  for  osteoporosis  in  addition  to  age,  sex,  and  estrogen 
deficiency.  The  guidelines  further  recommend  that  bone  mass  mea-
surement be considered in all women by age 65, a position ratified by 
the  U.S.  Preventive  Health  Services  Task  Force.  In  males,  the  use  of 
bone density determination is not recommended until the age of 70 
years in the absence of multiple risk factors or the occurrence of an 
osteoporosis-related fracture.

The  FRAX  score  incorporates  risk  factors  (age,  prior  fracture, 
family  history  of  hip  fracture,  low  body  weight,  cigarette  consump-
tion,  excessive  alcohol  use,  steroid  use,  and  rheumatoid  arthritis) 
with  BMD  to  assess  the  10-year  fracture  probabilities.  Fracture  risk 
probability  calculators  are  available  as  part  of  the  report  from  all 
DXA machines and also available online (https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/
FRAX/) (Fig. 411-7). In the United States, it has been determined to 
be cost effective to treat if the 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk 
from  FRAX  is  ≥20%  and/or  the  10-year  risk  of  hip  fracture  is  ≥3%. 
FRAX is an imperfect tool, as it does not include any assessment of 
fall  risk,  and  secondary  causes  are  excluded  when  BMD  is  entered. 
More  importantly,  it  does  not  distinguish  the  contribution  toward 
future  fracture  probability  from  an  acute  recent  fracture  versus  the 
lesser importance of the more remote fracture. Moreover, there is no 
mandate  for  vertebral  fracture  diagnosis  and  no  additional  fracture 
probability  estimated  for  patients  who  have  had  multiple  fractures. 
Nonetheless,  it  is  useful  as  an  educational  tool  for  patients,  particu-
larly for those who are excessively worried about BMD levels despite 
relative youth and health.

TABLE 411-4  Indications for Bone Mineral Density Testing
•	 Women aged ≥65 and men aged ≥70; regardless of clinical risk factors
•	 Younger postmenopausal women, women in the menopausal transition, and 

men aged from 50 to 69 with clinical risk factors for fracture

•	 Adults who have a fracture at or after age 50
•	 Adults with a condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or taking a medication (e.g., 
glucocorticoids at a daily dose >5 mg prednisone or equivalent for >3 months 
associated with low bone mass or bone loss

 ■ VERTEBRAL IMAGING
DXA equipment can also be used to obtain lateral images of the tho-
racic  and  lumbar  spine,  a  technique  called  vertebral  fracture  assess-
ment (VFA). While not as definitive as a radiograph, it is an excellent 
screening tool for vertebral abnormality in both women and men based 
on age and BMD even in the absence of any specific symptoms since 
the  majority  of  vertebral  fractures  are  asymptomatic  for  a  long  time. 
Furthermore, the VFA can be used to evaluate vertebral abnormality 
as a cause of height loss or back pain that suggests the possibility of an 
undiagnosed vertebral fracture.

Because vertebral fractures are often asymptomatic when they first 
occur, the diagnosis of vertebral fracture is rarely made at the time of 
the fracture occurrence. Since vertebral fractures, whether symptom-
atic or asymptomatic, are associated with the same clinical sequelae, 
it is critical that patients with these fractures are identified. Vertebral 
fracture prevalence in the United States based on the National Health 
and  Nutrition  Evaluation  Studies  (NHANES)  population  appears  to 
be ~10% in the 1970s and 20% in the 1980s, when the strictest crite-
ria for diagnosis are utilized. The NOF and other organizations have 
recommended  that  women  by  the  age  of  65  and  men  by  the  age  of 
70 undergo vertebral imaging if a T-score is ≤–1.5 at the spine, hip, 
or femoral neck. Vertebral imaging is also recommended for women 
by the age of 70 and men by the age of 80 if a T-score is <–1.0. For 
younger individuals, vertebral imaging is recommended for those with 
an  osteoporosis  related  fracture,  height  loss,  or  glucocorticoid  use.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Osteoporosis

The development of underlying skeletal changes is a gradual pro-
cess  occurring  under  a  variety  of  influences  throughout  adult 
life. Recognition of these influences allows intervention at several 
points,  although  the  need  for  aggressive  management  is  clearly 
dependent on a careful evaluation of each individual patient.

The  menopausal  transition  affects  all  women  by  their  late  50s 
and represents an opportunity to initiate a discussion about bone 
loss,  the  role  of  estrogen  loss,  and  other  risk  factors  that  might 
exacerbate  it.  Assessment  of  fracture  risk  using  a  tool  such  as 
FRAX (with or without bone density) provides a 10-year estimate 
of hip and major osteoporosis-related fracture risk and opens the 
discussion about preventive steps including, if required, the use of 
medication. If risk is low, then nutrition and lifestyle are the focus. 
If menopausal symptoms are prominent and estrogen intervention 
is  needed,  then  the  added  protection  against  bone  loss  should  be 
emphasized.

Among older women, the occurrence of a fracture should precip-
itate an evaluation of skeletal status including bone density testing. 
In this case, any fracture, whether traumatic or not, should trigger 
the  assessment.  Although  osteoporosis  is  associated  with  a  risk 
of  fracture  on  minimal  trauma,  individuals  with  osteoporosis  are 
consequently more likely to fracture at greater levels of trauma, and 
such  individuals  should  not  be  excluded  from  osteoporosis  eval-
uation simply because of the level of trauma. This concept, while 
obvious,  still  needs  emphasis  with  individual  patients,  physicians, 
and payors.

Patients  who  present  with  hip  or  spine  fractures  by  definition 
have osteoporosis and will require treatment for both the fracture 
itself  and  the  underlying  skeletal  disorder.  Other  long  bone  frac-
tures (e.g., distal radius) are triggers for evaluation of the skeleton 
upon which treatment decisions can be based.

In all individuals presenting with a fracture as a result of a fall, 
fall prevention strategies are an important adjunct to other lifestyle 
and nutritional interventions that must be reviewed with all patients. 
ROUTINE LABORATORY EVALUATION
There  is  no  established  algorithm  for  the  evaluation  of  women 
who present with osteoporosis. A general evaluation that includes

complete  blood  count,  serum  and  24-h  urine  calcium,  and  renal 
and hepatic function tests is useful for identifying selected second-
ary causes of low bone mass, particularly for women with fractures 
or unexpectedly low Z-scores. An elevated serum calcium level sug-
gests hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, whereas a reduced serum 
calcium level may reflect malnutrition or a malabsorption disease, 
such  as  celiac  disease.  In  the  presence  of  hypercalcemia,  a  serum 
PTH level differentiates between hyperparathyroidism (PTH↑) and 
malignancy  (PTH↓),  and  a  high  PTHrP  level  can  help  document 
the presence of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (Chap. 410). 
A  low  urine  calcium  (<50  mg/24  h)  suggests  malnutrition,  or

T-score at the spine, total hip, or femoral neck is <1.0

•	 Women aged from 65 to 69 and men aged from 70 to 79 if BMD T-score at the

•	 Prospective height loss of ≥0.8 in. (2 cm)c
•	 Recent or ongoing long-term glucocorticoid treatment

malabsorption; a high urine calcium (>300 mg/24 h) during nor-
mal  calcium  intake  (excluding  calcium  supplements  for  at  least  a 
week  before  the  urine  collection)  is  indicative  of  hypercalciuria. 
Hypercalciuria  occurs  primarily  in  three  situations:  (1)  a  renal 
calcium leak, which is more common in males with osteoporosis; 
(2) absorptive hypercalciuria, which can be idiopathic or associated 
with increased 1,25(OH)2D in granulomatous disease; or (3) hema-
tologic malignancies or conditions associated with excessive bone 
turnover such as Paget’s disease, hyperparathyroidism, and hyper-
thyroidism. Renal hypercalciuria is treated with thiazide diuretics, 
which lower urine calcium and help improve calcium economy. In 
this  setting,  thiazides  alone  can  improve  bone  mass  and  possibly 
reduce risk of fracture. They might also reduce renal stone risk.

Individuals who have osteoporosis-related fractures or bone den-
sity in the osteoporotic range should have a measurement of serum 
25(OH)D level since the intake of vitamin D required to achieve a 
target level >30 ng/mL is highly variable. Hyperthyroidism should 
be evaluated by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

When there is clinical suspicion of Cushing’s syndrome, urinary 
free  cortisol  levels  or  a  fasting  serum  cortisol  should  be  measured 
after  overnight  dexamethasone.  When  bowel  disease,  malabsorp-
tion, or malnutrition is suspected, serum albumin, cholesterol, and 
a complete blood count should be checked. Asymptomatic malab-
sorption  may  be  heralded  by  anemia  (macrocytic—vitamin  B12  or 
folate  deficiency;  microcytic—iron  deficiency)  or  low  serum  cho-
lesterol or urinary calcium levels. If these or other features suggest 
malabsorption, further evaluation is required. Asymptomatic celiac

frequency; the diagnosis can be made by testing for transglutaminase 
IgA antibodies but may require confirmation by endoscopic biopsy. 
A trial of a gluten-free diet can also be confirmatory (Chap. 325). 
When  osteoporosis  is  found  associated  with  symptoms  of  rash, 
multiple  allergies,  diarrhea,  or  flushing,  mastocytosis  should  be 
considered and excluded by using 24-h urine histamine collection 
or serum tryptase.

Myeloma can masquerade as generalized osteoporosis, although 
it  more  commonly  presents  with  bone  pain  and  characteristic 
“punched-out”  lesions  on  radiography.  Serum  and  urine  electro-
phoresis and/or evaluation for serum free light chains in urine are 
required  to  exclude  this  diagnosis.  More  commonly,  a  monoclo-
nal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is found, 
and  the  patient  is  subsequently  monitored  to  ensure  that  this  is 
not  an  incipient  myeloma.  MGUS  itself  may  be  associated  with 
an  increased  risk  of  osteoporosis.  A  bone  marrow  biopsy  may  be 
required to rule out myeloma (in patients with equivocal electro-
phoretic  results)  and  also  can  be  used  to  exclude  mastocytosis, 
leukemia, and other marrow infiltrative disorders such as Gaucher’s 
disease.

An  important  cause  of  fracture  among  the  aging  population  is 
diabetes, both type 1 and type 2. Patients with diabetes appear, at 
any given bone density, to be at higher risk of fracture than nondi-
abetics. The reasons include the effects on muscle and nerve that 
increase  the  risk  of  falls,  but  also  the  possibility  that  there  is  an 
underlying skeletal fragility as part of the metabolic consequences 
of diabetes itself. 
BONE BIOPSY
Tetracycline  labeling  of  the  skeleton  allows  determination  of  the 
rate of remodeling as well as evaluation for other metabolic bone 
diseases. The current use of BMD tests, in combination with hor-
monal evaluation and biochemical markers of bone remodeling, has 
largely replaced the clinical use of bone biopsy, although it remains 
an  important  tool  in  the  diagnosis  of  chronic  kidney  disease– 
mineral  bone  disease  (CKD-MBD),  in  evaluating  the  mechanism 
of action of osteoporosis pharmacologies, and in clinical research. 
BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS
Several  biochemical  tests  are  available  that  provide  an  index  of 
the  overall  rate  of  bone  remodeling  (Table  411-6).  Biochemical 
markers usually are characterized as those related primarily to bone 
formation or bone resorption. These tests measure the overall state 
of bone remodeling at a single point in time. Clinical use of these 
tests has been hampered by biologic variability (in part related to 
circadian rhythm) as well as analytic variability, although the latter 
is improving.

For  the  most  part,  remodeling  markers  do  not  predict  rates  of 
bone loss well enough in individuals to make accurate assessment 
of  potential  future  changes  in  bone  density.  However,  they  do 
provide adjunct information that assists in both evaluation of the 
patient and in assessment of treatment response. Markers of bone 
resorption  may  help  in  the  prediction  of  fracture  risk,  indepen-
dently of bone density, particularly in older individuals. In women 
≥65  years,  when  bone  density  results  are  greater  than  the  usual 
treatment thresholds noted above, a high level of bone resorption

should  prompt  consideration  of  treatment.  The  primary  use  of 
biochemical markers is for monitoring the response to treatment. 
With  the  introduction  of  antiresorptive  therapeutic  agents,  bone 
remodeling  declines  rapidly,  with  the  fall  in  resorption  occurring 
earlier  than  the  fall  in  formation.  Inhibition  of  bone  resorption 
is  maximal  within  3  months  or  so.  Thus,  measurement  of  bone 
resorption  (serum  C-terminal  telopeptide  measured  in  a  fasting 
specimen  is  the  preferred  marker)  before  initiating  therapy  and   
2–6  months  after  starting  therapy  provides  an  earlier  estimate 
of  patient  response  than  does  bone  densitometry.  A  decline  in 
resorptive  markers  can  be  ascertained  after  treatment  with  bis-
phosphonates,  denosumab,  or  estrogen;  this  effect  is  less  marked 
after treatment with weaker agents such as raloxifene or calcitonin. 
Bone turnover markers are also useful in monitoring the effects of 
1–34hPTH, or teriparatide, which rapidly increases bone formation 
(P1NP  is  the  most  sensitive,  but  osteocalcin  is  also  a  very  good 
formation marker) and later bone resorption. The recent suggestion 
of “drug holidays” (see below) has opened another use for biochem-
ical markers, allowing evaluation of the off-effect of drugs such as 
bisphosphonates.

TREATMENT
Osteoporosis 

MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH FRACTURES
Treatment of a patient with osteoporosis frequently involves man-
agement  of  acute  fractures  as  well  as  treatment  of  the  underlying 
disease.  Hip  fractures  almost  always  require  surgical  repair  if  the 
patient is to become ambulatory again. Depending on the location 
and severity of the fracture, condition of the neighboring joint, and 
general status of the patient, procedures may include open reduc-
tion and internal fixation with pins and plates, hemiarthroplasties, 
and total arthroplasties. These surgical procedures are followed by 
intense rehabilitation in an attempt to return patients to their pre-
fracture functional level. Long bone fractures often require either 
external  or  internal  fixation.  Other  fractures  (e.g.,  vertebral,  rib, 
and  pelvic  fractures)  can  often  be  managed  with  supportive  care, 
requiring no specific orthopedic treatment.

Only ~25–30% of vertebral compression fractures present with 
sudden-onset back pain. For acutely symptomatic fractures, treat-
ment  with  analgesics  is  required,  including  nonsteroidal  anti- 
inflammatory  agents  and/or  acetaminophen,  sometimes  with  the 
addition  of  a  narcotic  agent.  (A  few  small,  randomized  clinical 
trials  suggest  that  calcitonin  may  reduce  pain  related  to  acute 
vertebral compression fracture). A technique that involves percu-
taneous  injection  of  artificial  cement  (polymethylmethacrylate) 
into the vertebral body (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) may offer 
significant pain relief in some patients; however, controlled trials 
of these procedures have provided some doubt of their efficacy in 
the longer term. Furthermore, risks include acute extravasation of 
cement outside of the vertebral body with neurologic impairment 
and  possibly  an  increased  risk  of  vertebral  fracture  in  adjacent 
vertebrae  due  to  increased  rigidity  of  the  treated  vertebral  body. 
Short periods of bed rest may be helpful for pain management, but 
in general, early mobilization is recommended as it helps prevent 
further  bone  loss  associated  with  immobilization.  Occasionally, 
use of a soft elastic-style brace may facilitate earlier mobilization. 
Muscle spasms often occur with acute compression fractures and 
can be treated with muscle relaxants and heat treatments. Severe 
pain usually resolves within 6–10 weeks. More chronic severe pain 
might suggest the possibility of multiple myeloma or other under-
lying conditions.

Vertebral  fractures  cause  height  loss  because  of  the  loss  of 
vertebral  body  height  during  compression  of  the  vertebral  body. 
These  fractures  can  produce  kyphotic  posture,  particularly  when 
wedge  shaped,  or  just  loss  of  thoracic  height.  Chronic  pain  fol-
lowing  vertebral  fracture  is  probably  not  bony  in  origin;  instead,

it is related to abnormal strain on muscles, ligaments, and tendons 
and to secondary facet-joint arthritis associated with alterations in 
thoracic  and/or  abdominal  shape.  Chronic  pain  may  also  be  the 
result of ribs sitting right on top of the iliac crest bones, particularly 
in patients who have had multiple vertebral compression fractures. 
Chronic pain is difficult to treat effectively and may require anal-
gesics, sometimes including narcotic analgesics with the attendant 
risk of addiction. Frequent intermittent rest in a supine or semire-
clining position is often required to allow the soft tissues, which are 
under tension, to relax. Back and core-strengthening exercises may 
be  beneficial.  Heat  treatments  help  relax  muscles  and  reduce  the 
muscular  component  of  discomfort.  Various  physical  modalities, 
such as ultrasound and transcutaneous nerve stimulation, may be 
beneficial in some patients. Pain also occurs in the neck region, not 
as a result of compression fractures (which almost never occur in 
the cervical spine as a result of osteoporosis) but because of chronic 
strain associated with trying to elevate the head in a person with a 
significant thoracic kyphosis.

Multiple vertebral fractures often are associated with psycholog-
ical symptoms; this is not always appreciated. The changes in body 
configuration and back pain can lead to marked loss of self-image 
and  a  secondary  depression.  Altered  balance,  precipitated  by  the 
kyphosis and the anterior movement of the body’s center of gravity, 
leads to a fear of falling, a consequent tendency to remain indoors, 
and the onset of social isolation. These symptoms sometimes can be 
alleviated by family support and/or psychotherapy. Medication may 
be necessary when depressive features are present.

Multiple  studies  show  that  patients  presenting  with  fractures 
after age 50 years (even fractures traditionally linked to osteoporo-
sis) are largely not screened or treated for osteoporosis. Estimates 
suggest  that  <25%  of  fracture  patients  receive  follow-up  care. 
Recently,  several  studies  have  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  a 
relatively simple and inexpensive program that reduces the risk of 
subsequent fractures. In the Kaiser system, it is estimated that a 20% 
decline in hip fracture occurrence was seen with the introduction 
of a fracture liaison service. This approach has also been successful 
in other non-U.S. health systems. This involves a health care profes-
sional (usually a nurse or physician’s assistant) whose job is to edu-
cate patients and coordinate evaluation and osteoporosis treatment 
as patients move through the emergency room, inpatient care in an 
acute care hospital, rehabilitation hospital care, and/or orthopedic 
practice to outpatient management. If the Kaiser experience can be 
repeated, there would not only be significant savings of health care 
dollars  but  also  a  dramatic  drop  in  hip  fracture  incidence  and  a 
marked improvement in morbidity and mortality among the aging 
population. 

MANAGEMENT OF THE UNDERLYING DISEASE 
Risk Factor Reduction  After  risk  assessment,  patients  should  be 
thoroughly  educated  to  reduce  the  impact  of  modifiable  risk  fac-
tors  associated  with  bone  loss  and  falling.  Medications  should  be 
reviewed  to  ensure  that  all  are  necessary  and  taken  at  the  lowest 
required  dose.  Glucocorticoid  medication,  if  present,  should  be 
evaluated to determine that it is truly indicated and is being given 
in doses that are as low as possible. For those on thyroid hormone 
replacement,  TSH  testing  should  be  performed  to  determine  that 
an  excessive  dose  is  not  being  used,  as  iatrogenic  thyrotoxicosis 
can be associated with increased bone loss. In patients who smoke, 
efforts  should  be  made  to  facilitate  smoking  cessation.  Reducing 
risk  factors  for  falling  also  includes  alcohol  abuse  treatment  and 
a review of the medical regimen for any drugs that might be asso-
ciated  with  orthostatic  hypotension  and/or  sedation,  including 
hypnotics and anxiolytics. If nocturia occurs, the frequency should 
be  reduced,  if  possible  (e.g.,  by  decreasing  or  modifying  diuretic 
use), as arising in the middle of sleep is a common precipitant of a 
fall. Patients should be instructed about environmental safety with 
regard to eliminating exposed wires, curtain strings, slippery rugs, 
and mobile tables. Avoiding stocking feet on wood floors, checking

carpet condition (particularly on stairs), and providing good light 
in  paths  to  bathrooms  and  outside  the  home  are  important  pre-
ventive measures. Treatment for impaired vision is recommended, 
particularly a problem with depth perception, which is specifically 
associated  with  increased  falling  risk.  Elderly  patients  with  neu-
rologic  impairment  (e.g.,  stroke,  Parkinson’s  disease,  Alzheimer’s 
disease)  are  particularly  at  risk  of  falling  and  require  specialized 
supervision and care. In patients with risk factors for falls, especially 
those who live alone or spend significant time alone, medical alert 
systems should be prescribed. 
	 •	 Calcium  A  large  body  of 
Nutritional  Recommendations 
data indicates that less than optimal calcium intake results in bone 
loss.  Consequently,  an  adequate  intake  suppresses  bone  turnover. 
Recommended  intakes  from  an  Institute  of  Medicine  report  are 
shown  in  Table  411-7.  The  NHANES  have  consistently  docu-
mented that average calcium intakes fall considerably short of these 
recommendations.  The  preferred  source  of  calcium  is  diet,  but 
many  patients  require  calcium  supplementation  to  bring  intake 
to  ~1000  mg/d.  Best  sources  of  calcium  include  dairy  products 
(milk, yogurt, and cheese), nondaily milks (almond, rice, soy), and 
fortified  foods  such  as  certain  cereals,  waffles,  snacks,  juices,  and 
crackers. Some of these fortified foods contain as much calcium per 
serving as milk. Various vegetables and fruits, such as kale, broccoli, 
and dried figs, contain reasonably high calcium content, although 
some of it may not be fully bioavailable. Calcium intake calculators 
are available at NOF.org or NYSOPEP.org and will give a rough idea 
of total calcium intake.

If calcium supplements are required, they should be taken in doses 
sufficient  to  bring  total  intake  to  the  required  level  (~1000  mg/d). 
Doses  of  supplements  should  be  ≤600  mg  per  single  dose,  as  the 
calcium  absorption  fraction  decreases  at  higher  doses.  Calcium 
supplements  should  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  elemental 
calcium content of the supplement, not the weight of the calcium 
salt  (Table  411-8).  Calcium  supplements  containing  carbonate 
are  best  taken  with  food  since  they  require  acid  for  solubility. 
Calcium citrate supplements can be taken at any time. To confirm

bioavailability, calcium supplements can be placed in distilled vine-
gar. They should dissolve within 30 min.

Several controlled clinical trials of calcium, mostly with accom-
panying vitamin D, have confirmed reductions in clinical fractures, 
including  fractures  of  the  hip  (~20–30%  risk  reduction),  partic-
ularly  in  elderly  individuals  who  are  more  likely  to  be  dietarily 
deficient.  All  recent  studies  of  pharmacologic  agents  have  been 
conducted  in  the  context  of  calcium  replacement  (±  vitamin  D). 
Thus,  it  is  standard  practice  to  ensure  an  adequate  calcium  and 
vitamin  D  intake  in  patients  with  osteoporosis  whether  they  are 
receiving  additional  pharmacologic  therapy  or  not.  A  systematic 
review confirmed a greater BMD response to antiresorptive therapy 
when calcium intake was adequate.

Although  side  effects  from  supplemental  calcium  are  minimal 
(eructation  and  constipation  mostly  with  carbonate  salts),  indi-
viduals  with  a  history  of  kidney  stones  should  have  a  24-h  urine 
calcium  determination  before  starting  increased  calcium  to  avoid 
exacerbating  hypercalciuria.  A  recent  analysis  of  published  data 
has  suggested  that  high  intakes  of  calcium  from  supplements  are 
associated with an increase in the risk of renal stones, calcification 
in  arteries,  and  potentially  an  increased  risk  of  heart  disease  and 
stroke.  This  is  an  evolving  story  with  data  both  confirming  and 
refuting  the  finding.  Since  high  calcium  intakes  also  increase  the 
risk of renal stones and confer no extra benefit to the skeleton, the 
recommendation  that  total  intakes  should  be  between  1000  and 
1500 mg/d seems reasonable. 
Vitamin  D  Diet  alone  rarely  contains  sufficient  vitamin  D  to 
maintain  target  circulating  levels  (serum  25[OH]D  consistently   
>75  μmol/L  [30  ng/mL]).  Vitamin  D  is  synthesized  from  a  pre-
cursor in the skin under the influence of heat and ultraviolet light 
(Chap. 409). Production is blocked by sunscreen and sun avoidance. 
However, large segments of the population do not obtain sufficient 
vitamin  D  from  either  skin  production  or  dietary  sources.  Since 
vitamin D supplementation at doses that would achieve these serum 
levels  is  safe  and  inexpensive,  the  National  Academy  of  Medicine 
(formerly, Institute of Medicine [IOM]) recommends daily intakes 
of 200 IU for adults <50 years of age, 400 IU for those 50–70 years, 
and 600 IU for those >70 years (based on obtaining a serum level 
of  20  ng/mL,  lower  than  the  level  recommended  by  most  other 
guidelines). Multivitamin tablets usually contain 400 IU, and many 
calcium  supplements  also  contain  vitamin  D.  Some  data  suggest 
that  higher  doses  (≥1000  IU)  may  be  required  in  the  elderly  and 
chronically ill. The IOM report suggests that it is safe to take up to 
4000 IU/d. For those with osteoporosis or those at risk of osteopo-
rosis, 1000–2000 IU/d can usually maintain serum 25(OH)D above 
30  ng/mL.  Vitamin  D  supplementation  by  itself  does  not  appear 
to  reduce  fracture  risk,  but  the  combination  of  adequate  calcium 
intake and vitamin D does decrease fracture risk. Low vitamin D 
levels  appear  associated  with  more  serious  outcomes  in  response 
to COVID-19. Whether this is a cause-and-effect relationship or a 
chance occurrence is not known, but it certainly argues for ensuring 
normal circulation levels of vitamin D. 
Other  Nutrients  Other  nutrients  such  as  salt,  high  animal 
protein intakes, and caffeine may have modest effects on calcium 
excretion or absorption. Adequate vitamin K status is required for 
optimal  carboxylation  of  osteocalcin.  States  in  which  vitamin  K 
nutrition or metabolism is impaired, such as with long-term warfa-
rin therapy, have been associated with reduced bone mass. Research 
concerning  cola-based  soda  beverage  intake  is  controversial  but 
suggests a possible link to reduced bone mass through factors that 
appear independent of caffeine.

Magnesium is abundant in foods, and magnesium deficiency is 
quite rare in the absence of a serious chronic disease. Magnesium 
supplementation may be warranted in patients with inflammatory 
bowel disease, celiac disease, chemotherapy, severe diarrhea, mal-
nutrition, or alcoholism. Dietary phytoestrogens, which are derived 
primarily  from  soy  products  and  legumes  (e.g.,  garbanzo  beans 

[chickpeas] and lentils), exert some estrogenic activity but are insuf-
ficiently potent to justify their use in place of a pharmacologic agent 
in the treatment of osteoporosis.

Patients with hip fractures are often frail and relatively malnour-
ished.  Some  data  suggest  an  improved  outcome  in  such  patients 
when  they  are  provided  calorie  and  protein  supplementation. 
Excessive protein intake can increase renal calcium excretion, but 
this can be corrected by an adequate calcium intake. Strontium as 
a  dietary  mineral  has  also  been  implicated  with  strontium  ranel-
ate approved in some countries for treatment of osteoporosis. No 
evidence suggests that strontium in doses used in supplements can 
reduce fracture risk, but by virtue of replacing calcium in bone with 
the larger strontium atom, this supplement can produce an increase 
in bone density of questionable significance. 

Exercise  Exercise  in  young  individuals  increases  the  likelihood 
that  they  will  attain  the  maximal  genetically  determined  peak 
bone mass. Meta-analyses of studies performed in postmenopausal 
women  indicate  that  weight-bearing  exercise  helps  prevent  bone 
loss but does not appear to result in substantial gain of bone mass. 
This beneficial effect wanes if exercise is discontinued. Most of the 
studies are short term, and a more substantial effect on bone mass 
is likely if exercise is continued over a long period. Exercise also has 
beneficial effects on neuromuscular function, and it improves coor-
dination, balance, and strength, thereby reducing the risk of falling. 
A walking program is a practical way to start. Other activities such 
as  dancing,  racquet  sports,  cross-country  skiing,  and  use  of  gym 
equipment, are also recommended, depending on the patient’s per-
sonal preference and general condition. Even women who cannot 
walk benefit from swimming or water exercises, not so much for the 
effects on bone, which are quite minimal, but because of effects on 
muscle. Exercise habits should be consistent, optimally at least three 
times a week. For most patients, we suggest participation in exercise 
regimens that the patient enjoys in order to improve adherence. We 
also emphasize the importance of making exercise a social activity, 
again to improve adherence. Many individuals experience a fear of 
falling that can lead to social isolation and depression. Group exer-
cises can help to alleviate this problem by providing sense of social 
connectivity among participants.

Tai chi is a traditional Chinese martial art that utilizes a series 
of  gentle,  flowing  movements  to  promote  and  maintain  flexibil-
ity,  balance,  endurance,  proprioception,  and  strength.  It  involves 
constant  movement  through  all  three  spatial  dimensions.  As  a 
three-dimensional exercise, tai chi may be incorporated as part of 
balance training program for individuals with osteoporosis. Tai chi 
is generally considered a safe activity. The evidence for fall preven-
tion in tai chi has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. 
Results have been controversial; however, recent systematic reviews 
have provided a growing body of evidence to indicate that partic-
ipating in tai chi can significantly reduce the risk of falls in older 
adults. The benefit appears to be greater when tai chi is practiced 
with increased frequency.

It  is  recommended  that  individuals  with  osteoporosis  or  oste-
oporotic  vertebral  fractures  participate  in  exercise  programs  that 
involve  both  resistance  and  balance  training.  Slow,  controlled 
movements are recommended in order to avoid injuries. Exercise 
modifications  and  avoidance  of  certain  postures  (such  as  spinal 
flexion)  may  be  advised  for  those  with  prior  injuries  and  back 
or  joint  pain.  Caution  should  be  taken  to  avoid  activities  that 
can  lead  to  potential  fractures,  such  as  performing  activities  on 
slippery  surfaces  or  twisting  or  bending  the  spine  quickly  while 
transitioning  between  different  positions.  Precautions  should  be 
taken to avoid injury when exercising with loads and performing 
exercises that challenge balance. For individuals with osteoporosis 
who  have  a  high  risk  for  fracture,  vertebral  fractures,  sedentary 
lifestyle,  or  comorbid  conditions  that  impact  exercise  tolerance, 
consultation  with  physical  therapists  to  learn  safe  exercise  prac-
tices is recommended.

PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS
Several guidelines for the treatment of osteoporosis have been pub-
lished  over  the  past  few  years.  Patients  presenting  with  fractures 
of  the  hip  and  spine  should  be  evaluated  for  treatment.  Patients 
presenting  with  low-trauma  fractures  in  the  setting  of  a  BMD  in 
the  low  bone  mass  or  osteoporosis  range  should  be  treated  with 
pharmacologic  agents.  Most  guidelines  also  suggest  that  patients 
be  considered  for  treatment  when  BMD  T-score  is  ≤–2.5,  a  level 
consistent with the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Treatment should also 
be considered in postmenopausal women with fracture or multiple 
risk factors even if BMD is not in the osteoporosis range. Treatment 
thresholds depend on cost-effectiveness analyses but, in the United 
States,  are  a  >20%  10-year  major  fracture  probability  and  >3% 
10-year  hip  fracture  probability.  It  must  be  emphasized,  however, 
that  as  with  other  diseases,  risk  assessment  is  an  inexact  science 
when  applied  to  individual  patients.  Fractures  are  chance  occur-
rences that can happen to anyone and do! Patients often accept risks 
that are higher than the physician might like out of concern for the 
(usually considerably lower) risks of adverse events of drugs.

Pharmacologic therapies for osteoporosis are either antiresorp-
tive or anabolic. The antiresorptive agents include medications that 
have broad effects such as hormone/estrogen therapy and selective 
estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) as well as those agents that 
are  specific  for  the  treatment  of  osteoporosis  (bisphosphonates, 
denosumab,  and  calcitonin).  The  anabolic  agents  are  teriparatide, 
abaloparatide,  and  romosozumab.  Denosumab,  considered  as  an 
antiresorptive, allows bone formation to continue, and thus, there is 
an increase in bone density beyond that occurring with agents that 
inhibit resorption directly leading to a reduction in bone formation. 
	 •	 Estrogens  A  large  body  of  clinical 
Antiresorptive  Agents 
trial  data  indicates  that  various  types  of  estrogens  (conjugated 
equine  estrogens,  estradiol,  estrone,  esterified  estrogens,  ethinyl 
estradiol, and mestranol) reduce bone turnover, prevent bone loss, 
and induce small increases in bone mass of the spine, hip, and total 
body.  The  effects  of  estrogen  are  seen  in  women  with  natural  or 
surgical  menopause  and  in  late  postmenopausal  women  with  or 
without  established  osteoporosis.  Estrogens  are  efficacious  when 
administered  orally,  transdermally,  or  by  subcutaneous  implant. 
For both oral and transdermal routes of administration, combined 
estrogen/progestin  preparations  are  now  available  in  many  coun-
tries, obviating the problem of taking two tablets or using a patch 
and oral progestin.

For oral estrogens, the standard recommended doses have been 
0.3 mg/d for esterified estrogens, 0.625 mg/d for conjugated equine 
estrogens, and 5 μg/d for ethinyl estradiol. For transdermal estro-
gen, the commonly used dose supplies 50 μg of estradiol per day, 
but  a  lower  dose  may  be  appropriate  for  some  individuals.  Dose- 
response data for conjugated equine estrogens indicate that lower 
doses (0.3 and 0.45 mg/d) are effective. Doses even lower have also 
been shown to slow bone loss. 
Fracture  Data  Epidemiologic  databases  indicate  that  women 
who take estrogen replacement have a 50% reduction, on average, 
of osteoporosis-related fractures, including hip fractures. The ben-
eficial effect of estrogen is greatest among those who start replace-
ment  early  and  continue  the  treatment;  the  benefit  declines  after 
discontinuation  to  the  extent  that  there  is  no  residual  protective 
effect  against  fracture  by  10  years  after  discontinuation.  The  first 
clinical trial evaluating fractures as secondary outcomes, the Heart 
and  Estrogen-Progestin  Replacement  Study  (HERS)  trial,  showed 
no effect of hormone therapy on hip or other clinical fractures in 
women with established coronary artery disease. These data made 
the  results  of  the  Women’s  Health  Initiative  (WHI)  exceedingly 
important (Chap. 395). The estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI in 
>16,000  postmenopausal  healthy  women  indicated  that  hormone 
therapy reduces the risk of hip and clinical spine fracture by 34% 
and that of all clinical fractures by 24%.

A few smaller clinical trials have evaluated spine fracture occur-
rence as an outcome with estrogen therapy. They have consistently

shown  that  estrogen  treatment  reduces  the  incidence  of  vertebral 
compression fracture.

The WHI has provided a vast amount of data on the multisys-
temic  effects  of  hormone  therapy.  Although  earlier  observational 
studies suggested that estrogen replacement might reduce heart dis-
ease, the WHI showed that combined estrogen-progestin treatment 
increased risk of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction by ~29%, 
confirming  data  from  the  HERS  study.  Other  important  relative 
risks included a 40% increase in stroke, a 100% increase in venous 
thromboembolic disease, and a 26% increase in risk of breast can-
cer. Subsequent analyses have confirmed the increased risk of stroke 
and, in a substudy, showed a twofold increase in dementia. Benefits 
other  than  the  fracture  reductions  noted  above  included  a  37% 
reduction in the risk of colon cancer. These relative risks have to be 
interpreted in light of absolute risk (Fig. 411-8). For example, out of 
10,000 women treated with estrogen-progestin for 1 year, there will 
be 8 excess heart attacks, 8 excess breast cancers, 18 excess venous 
thromboembolic  events,  5  fewer  hip  fractures,  44  fewer  clinical 
fractures, and 6 fewer colorectal cancers. These numbers must be 
multiplied  by  the  number  of  years  of  hormone  treatment.  There 
was no effect of combined hormone treatment on the risk of uterine 
cancer or total mortality.

It is important to note that these WHI findings apply specifically 
to  hormone  treatment  in  the  form  of  conjugated  equine  estrogen 
plus  medroxyprogesterone  acetate.  The  relative  benefits  and  risks 
of  unopposed  estrogen  in  women  who  had  hysterectomies  vary 
somewhat.  They  still  show  benefits  against  fracture  occurrence 
and  increased  risk  of  venous  thrombosis  and  stroke,  similar  in 
magnitude to the risks for combined hormone therapy. In contrast, 
though,  the  estrogen-only  arm  of  WHI  indicated  no  increased 
risk of heart attack or breast cancer. The data suggest that at least 
some of the detrimental effects of combined therapy are related to 
the progestin component. In addition, there is the possibility, sug-
gested by primate data, that the risk accrues mainly to women who 
have some years of estrogen deficiency before initiating treatment. 
Nonetheless, there is marked reluctance among women for estrogen  
therapy/hormone  therapy,  and  the  U.S.  Preventive  Services  Task 
Force  has  specifically  suggested  that  estrogen  therapy/hormone 
therapy not be used for disease prevention. 
Mode  of  Action  Two  subtypes  of  ERs,  α  and  β,  have  been 
identified  in  bone  and  other  tissues.  Cells  of  monocyte  lineage 
express  both  ERα  and  ERβ,  as  do  osteoblasts.  Estrogen-mediated 
effects  vary  with  the  receptor  type.  Using  ER  knockout  mouse 
models, elimination of ERα produces a modest reduction in bone 
mass,  whereas  mutation  of  ERβ  has  less  of  an  effect  on  bone.  A 
male  patient  with  a  homozygous  mutation  of  ERα  had  markedly 
decreased  bone  density  as  well  as  abnormalities  in  epiphyseal 
closure,  confirming  the  important  role  of  ERα  in  bone  biology.

The  mechanism  of  estrogen  action  in  bone  is  an  area  of  active 
investigation (Fig. 411-5). Although data are conflicting, estrogens 
may inhibit osteoclasts directly. However, the majority of estrogen 
(and androgen) effects on bone resorption are mediated indirectly 
through  paracrine  factors  produced  by  osteoblasts.  These  actions 
include  (1)  increasing  osteoprotegerin  production  by  osteoblasts, 
(2)  increasing  IGF-I  and  TGF-β,  and  (3)  suppressing  IL-1  (α  and 
β),  IL-6,  TNF-α,  and  osteocalcin  synthesis.  The  indirect  estrogen 
actions primarily decrease bone resorption. 
Progestins 
In women with a uterus, daily progestin or cyclical 
progestins at least 12 days per month are prescribed in combination 
with  estrogens  to  reduce  the  risk  of  uterine  cancer.  Medroxypro-
gesterone acetate and norethindrone acetate blunt the high-density 
lipoprotein response to estrogen, but micronized progesterone does 
not.  Neither  medroxyprogesterone  acetate  nor  micronized  pro-
gesterone appears to have an independent effect on bone; at lower 
doses of estrogen, norethindrone acetate may have an additive ben-
efit. In breast tissue, progestins may account for the increased risk 
of breast cancer with combination treatment. 
SERMs  Two  SERMs  are  used  currently  in  postmenopausal 
women:  raloxifene,  which  is  approved  by  the  FDA  for  the  pre-
vention and treatment of osteoporosis as well as the prevention of 
breast cancer, and tamoxifen, which is approved for the prevention 
and  treatment  of  breast  cancer.  A  third  SERM,  bazedoxifene,  is 
marketed in combination with conjugated estrogen for treatment of 
menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss. Bazedoxifene 
protects the uterus and breast from effects of estrogen and makes 
the use of progestin unnecessary.

Tamoxifen  reduces  bone  turnover  and  bone  loss  in  postmeno-
pausal  women  compared  with  placebo  groups.  These  findings 
support the concept that tamoxifen acts as an estrogenic agent in 
bone. There are limited data on the effect of tamoxifen on fracture 
risk,  but  the  Breast  Cancer  Prevention  study  indicated  a  possible 
reduction in clinical vertebral, hip, and Colles’ fractures. Tamoxifen 
is not FDA approved for prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. 
The major benefit of tamoxifen is on breast cancer occurrence and 
recurrence  in  women  with  ER-positive  tumors.  The  breast  can-
cer  prevention  trial  indicated  that  tamoxifen  administration  over 
4–5 years reduced the incidence of new invasive and noninvasive 
breast cancer by ~45% in women at increased risk of breast cancer. 
The incidence of ER-positive breast cancers was reduced by 65%. 
Tamoxifen increases the risk of uterine cancer in postmenopausal 
women, limiting its use for breast cancer prevention in women at 
low or moderate risk.

Raloxifene (60 mg/d) has effects on bone turnover and bone mass 
that are very similar to those of tamoxifen, indicating that this agent 
is also estrogenic on the skeleton. The effect of raloxifene on bone 
density  (+1.4–2.8%  vs  placebo  in  the  spine,  hip,  and  total  body) 
is somewhat less than that seen with standard doses of estrogens. 
Raloxifene reduces the occurrence of vertebral fracture by 30–50%, 
depending on the population; however, there are no data confirm-
ing  that  raloxifene  can  reduce  the  risk  of  nonvertebral  fractures 
after 8 years of observation.

Raloxifene,  like  tamoxifen  and  estrogen,  has  effects  in  other 
organ systems. The most beneficial effect appears to be a reduction 
in  invasive  breast  cancer  (mainly  decreased  ER-positive)  occur-
rence of ~65% in women who take raloxifene compared to placebo. 
In  a  head-to-head  study,  raloxifene  was  as  effective  as  tamoxifen 
in preventing breast cancer in high-risk women, and raloxifene is 
FDA approved for this indication. In a further study, raloxifene had 
no  effect  on  heart  disease  in  women  with  increased  risk  for  this 
outcome. In contrast to tamoxifen, raloxifene is not associated with 
an increase in the risk of uterine cancer or benign uterine disease. 
Raloxifene  increases  the  occurrence  of  hot  flashes  but  reduces 
serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), 
and fibrinogen. Raloxifene, with its positive effects on breast cancer 
and vertebral fractures, has become a useful agent for the treatment 
of  the  younger  asymptomatic  postmenopausal  woman.  In  some 

women, a recurrence of menopausal symptoms may occur. Usually 
this is evanescent but occasionally is sufficiently impactful on daily 
life and sleep that the drug must be withdrawn. Raloxifene increases 
the risk of deep-vein thrombosis and may increase the risk of death 
from  stroke  among  older  women.  Consequently,  it  is  not  usually 
recommended for women over age 70 years.

MODE OF ACTION OF SERMS
All  SERMs  bind  to  the  ER,  but  each  agent  produces  a  unique 
receptor-drug conformation. As a result, specific coactivator or co- 
repressor proteins are bound to the receptor (Chap. 377), resulting 
in  differential  effects  on  gene  transcription  that  vary  depending 
on  other  transcription  factors  present  in  the  cell.  Another  aspect 
of  selectivity  is  the  affinity  of  each  SERM  for  the  different  ERα 
and  ERβ  subtypes,  which  are  expressed  differentially  in  various 
tissues. These tissue-selective effects of SERMs offer the possibility 
of tailoring estrogen therapy to best meet the needs and risk factor 
profile of an individual patient. 

Bisphosphonates  Bisphosphonates  have  become  the  mainstay 
of  osteoporosis  treatment,  in  part  related  to  cost  as  they  become 
generic. Alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid 
are approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis.  Alendronate,  risedronate,  and  zoledronic  acid  are 
also  approved  for  the  treatment  of  steroid-induced  osteoporosis, 
and risedronate and zoledronic acid are approved for prevention of 
steroid-induced  osteoporosis.  Alendronate,  risedronate,  and  zole-
dronic acid are also approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men.
Alendronate decreases bone turnover and increases bone mass in 
the spine by up to 8% versus placebo and by 6% versus placebo in 
the hip. Multiple trials have evaluated its effect on fracture occur-
rence. The Fracture Intervention Trial provided evidence in >2000 
women  with  prevalent  vertebral  fractures  that  daily  alendronate 
treatment (5 mg/d for 2 years and 10 mg/d for 9 months afterward) 
reduces vertebral fracture risk by ~50%, multiple vertebral fractures 
by up to 90%, and hip fractures by up to 50%. Several subsequent 
trials have confirmed these findings (Fig. 411-9). For example, in a 
study of >1900 women with low bone mass treated with alendronate 
(10 mg/d) versus placebo, the incidence of all nonvertebral fractures 
was  reduced  by  ~47%  after  only  1  year.  In  the  United  States,  the 
70-mg weekly dose is approved for treatment of osteoporosis and 
the dose of 35 mg per week is approved for prevention, with those 
doses showing equivalence to daily dosing based on bone turnover 
and bone mass response.

Consequently,  once-weekly  therapy  generally 

is  preferred 
because of lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects and ease 
of administration. Alendronate should be taken with a full glass of 
water  before  breakfast  after  an  overnight  fast,  as  bisphosphonates 
are poorly absorbed. Because of the potential for esophageal irrita-
tion, alendronate is contraindicated in patients who have stricture 
or inadequate emptying of the esophagus. It is recommended that 
patients remain upright (standing or sitting) for at least 30 minutes 
after taking the medication to avoid esophageal irritation and that 
food and fluids (other than water) be avoided for the same duration. 
In  clinical  trials,  overall  gastrointestinal  symptomatology  was  no 
different with alendronate than with placebo, but in practice, all oral 
bisphosphonates  have  been  associated  with  esophageal  irritation 
and inflammation.

Risedronate also reduces bone turnover and increases bone mass. 
Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated 40–50% reduction in 
vertebral fracture risk over 3 years, accompanied by a 40% reduc-
tion in clinical nonspine fractures. The only clinical trial specifically 
designed  to  evaluate  hip  fracture  outcome  (HIP)  indicated  that 
risedronate reduced hip fracture risk in women in their seventies 
with confirmed osteoporosis by 40%. In contrast, risedronate was 
not  effective  at  reducing  hip  fracture  occurrence  in  older  women 
(80+ years) without proven osteoporosis. Studies have shown that 
35  mg  of  risedronate  administered  once  weekly  is  therapeutically 
equivalent  to  5  mg/d.  The  instructions  for  oral  administration

noted for alendronate apply to all three oral bisphosphonates. There 
is also a preparation of risedronate (35 mg) that can be taken after 
breakfast.  Risedronate  is  the  only  bisphosphonate  that  has  this 
dosing flexibility.

Ibandronate is the third amino-bisphosphonate approved in the 
United  States.  Ibandronate  (2.5  mg/d)  has  been  shown  in  clinical 
trials to reduce vertebral fracture risk by ~40% but with no overall 
effect on nonvertebral fractures. In a post hoc analysis of subjects 
with a femoral neck T-score of ≤–3, ibandronate reduced the risk of 
nonvertebral fractures by ~60%. In clinical trials, ibandronate doses 
of 150 mg/month PO or 3 mg every 3 months IV had greater effects 
on turnover and bone mass than did 2.5 mg/d. Patients should take 
oral ibandronate in the same way as other bisphosphonates, but with 
1 h elapsing before other food or drink (other than plain water).

Zoledronic acid is a potent bisphosphonate with a unique admin-
istration regimen (5 mg by 30-min IV infusion at most annually). 
Zoledronic acid data confirm that it is highly effective in fracture 
risk  reduction.  In  a  study  of  >7000  women  followed  for  3  years, 
zoledronic  acid  5  mg  IV  annually)  reduced  the  risk  of  vertebral 
fractures  by  70%,  nonvertebral  fractures  by  25%,  and  hip  frac-
tures  by  40%.  These  results  were  associated  with  less  height  loss 
and  disability.  In  the  treated  population,  there  was  an  increased 
risk of almost 25% of an acute phase reaction in patients with no 
prior  bisphosphonate  exposure  (fever,  myalgias,  headache,  mal-
aise),  but  effects  were  short-lived  (2–3  days).  Detailed  evaluation 
of all bisphosphonates failed to confirm a risk of atrial fibrillation. 
Zoledronic acid has also been studied in a placebo-controlled trial 
of women and men within 3 months of an acute hip fracture. The 
risk of recurrent fracture was reduced by 35%, and there was a 28% 
reduction in mortality that was greater than might be expected by 
the reduction in hip fracture alone. 

Common  Bisphosphonate  Adverse  Events  All  bisphos-
phonates have been associated with some musculoskeletal and joint 
pains  of  unclear  etiology,  which  are  occasionally  severe.  There  is 
potential  for  renal  toxicity,  and  bisphosphonates  are  contraindi-
cated in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30–35 
mL/min. Hypocalcemia can occur.

There has been concern about two potential side effects associ-
ated with bisphosphonate use. The first is osteonecrosis of the jaw 
(ONJ).  ONJ  usually  follows  a  dental  procedure  in  which  bone  is 
exposed (dental extractions and implants). It is presumed that the 
exposed  bone  becomes  infected  and  dies.  ONJ  is  more  common 
among  cancer  patients  receiving  high  doses  of  bisphosphonates 
for skeletal metastases. It is rare among persons with osteoporosis 
on usual doses of bisphosphonates. Oral antibiotic rinses and oral 
systemic antibiotics may be useful to prevent this rare adverse event 
if  risk  is  perceived  to  be  particularly  high.  The  second  is  called 
atypical  femoral  fracture.  These  are  unusual  fractures  that  occur 
in  the  subtrochanteric  femoral  region  or  across  the  femoral  shaft 
distal to the lesser trochanter. They are often preceded by pain in 
the  lateral  thigh  or  groin  that  can  be  present  for  weeks,  months, 
or  even  years  before  the  fracture.  The  fractures  occur  on  trivial 
trauma,  are  horizontal  with  a  medial  beak,  and  are  noncommin-
uted. A committee put together by the American Society for Bone 
and Mineral Research described the major and minor criteria for 
these fractures, which appear to be related to duration of bisphos-
phonate therapy. The overall risk appears quite low, especially when 
compared to the number of hip fractures saved by these therapies, 
but  they  often  require  surgical  fixation  and  are  difficult  to  heal. 
Some evidence suggests that if the fractures are found early, when 
there  is  evidence  of  periosteal  stress  reaction  or  stress  fracture, 
prior to the occurrence of overt fracture, that teriparatide can help 
heal  the  fracture  and  preclude  the  need  for  surgical  repair.  We 
routinely  inform  patients  initiating  bisphosphonates  that  if  they 
develop thigh or groin pain they should inform us. Routine x-rays 
will sometimes detect cortical thickening or even a stress fracture, 
but  more  commonly,  MRI  or  technetium  bone  scan  is  required. 
The presence of an abnormality requires, at minimum, a period of

modified weight bearing and may need prophylactic rodding of the 
femur. It is important to realize that these may be bilateral (~50% 
of  the  time),  and  when  an  abnormality  is  found,  the  other  femur 
should be checked. It is unknown whether patients who have these 
atypical  femur  fractures  can  ever  receive  antiresorptive  therapies 
again in the future, but it seems prudent to avoid their use for the 
majority of these individuals. 
Mode  of  Action  Bisphosphonates  are  structurally  related  to 
pyrophosphates, compounds that are incorporated into bone matrix. 
Bisphosphonates specifically impair osteoclast function and reduce 
osteoclast number, in part by inducing apoptosis. Recent evidence 
suggests that the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates also inhibit 
protein  prenylation,  one  of  the  end  products  in  the  mevalonic 
acid  pathway,  by  inhibiting  the  enzyme  farnesyl  pyrophosphate 
synthase.  This  effect  disrupts  intracellular  protein  trafficking  and 
ultimately may lead to apoptosis. Some bisphosphonates have very 
long retention in the skeleton and may exert long-term effects. The 
consequences of this, if any, are unknown. 
Calcitonin  Calcitonin  is  a  polypeptide  hormone  produced  in 
the thyroid gland (Chap. 410). Its physiologic role is unclear as no 
skeletal  disease  has  been  described  in  association  with  calcitonin 
deficiency  or  excess.  Calcitonin  preparations  are  approved  by  the 
FDA for Paget’s disease, hypercalcemia, and osteoporosis in women 
>5 years past menopause.

Injectable  calcitonin  produces  small  increments  in  bone  mass 
of  the  lumbar  spine.  However,  difficulty  of  administration  and 
frequent  reactions,  including  nausea  and  facial  flushing,  make 
general  use  limited.  A  nasal  spray  containing  calcitonin  (200 
IU/d) is available for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
women.  One  study  suggests  that  nasal  calcitonin  produces  small 
increments in bone mass and a small reduction in new vertebral 
fractures in calcitonin-treated patients (at one dose) versus those 
on calcium alone. There has been no proven effectiveness against 
nonvertebral fractures. Calcitonin is not indicated for prevention 
of osteoporosis and is not sufficiently potent to prevent bone loss 
in early postmenopausal women. Calcitonin might have an anal-
gesic effect on bone pain, both in the subcutaneous and possibly 
in  the  nasal  form.  Concerns  have  been  raised  about  an  increase 
in the incidence of cancer associated with calcitonin use. Initially, 
the  cancer  noted  was  of  the  prostate,  but  an  analysis  of  all  data 
suggested  a  more  general  increase  in  cancer  risk.  In  Europe,  the 
European  Medicines  Agency  has  removed  the  osteoporosis  indi-
cation,  and  an  FDA  Advisory  Committee  has  voted  for  a  similar 
change in the United States. 
Mode  of  Action  Calcitonin  suppresses  osteoclast  activity  by 
direct  action  on  the  osteoclast  calcitonin  receptor.  Osteoclasts 
exposed to calcitonin cannot maintain their active ruffled border, 
which normally maintains close contact with underlying bone. 
Denosumab  Denosumab  is  a  novel  agent  that,  given  twice 
yearly by subcutaneous administration in a randomized controlled 
trial  in  postmenopausal  women  with  osteoporosis,  has  been 
shown to increase BMD in the spine, hip, and forearm and reduce 
vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures over a 3-year period by 
70,  40,  and  20%,  respectively  (Fig.  411-10).  Other  clinical  trials 
indicate ability to increase bone mass in postmenopausal women 
with low bone mass (above osteoporosis range) and in postmeno-
pausal women with breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitor 
therapies. In the oncology literature, denosumab reduces the risk 
of fractures in women on aromatase inhibitors. In a study of men 
with  prostate  cancer  treated  with  androgen  deprivation  therapy, 
denosumab  increased  bone  mass  and  reduced  vertebral  fracture 
occurrence.  An  analysis  of  five  placebo-controlled  studies  has 
suggested reduced risk of falls in patients with osteoporosis treated 
with denosumab.

Denosumab was approved by the FDA in 2010 for the treatment 
of  postmenopausal  women  who  have  a  high  risk  for  osteoporotic 
fractures, including those with a history of fracture or multiple risk

and B. and C. times to nonvertebral and hip fracture. RR, relative risk. (Reproduced

factors for fracture, and those who have failed or are intolerant to 
other  osteoporosis  therapy.  Denosumab  is  also  approved  for  the 
treatment of osteoporosis in men at high risk for fracture, women 
with breast cancer on aromatase inhibitors, and men with prostate 
cancer  on  androgen  deprivation  treatment.  A  long-term  observa-
tional extension of the pivotal trial in postmenopausal women has 
provided evidence that BMD continues to increase in both the spine 
and  hip  with  3–10  years  of  denosumab  treatment,  with  fracture 
rates that are at least as low as those seen with denosumab during 
the active placebo-controlled portion of the trial.

Denosumab  may  increase  the  risk  of  ONJ  and  atypical  femur 
fractures  similarly  to  bisphosphonates.  Estimated  incidence  is 
5/10,000  patient-years  for  ONJ  and  1/10,000  patient-years  for 
atypical  femur  fractures.  Denosumab  can  cause  hypersensitivity 
reactions,  hypocalcemia,  and  skin  reactions  including  dermatitis, 
rash, and eczema. Early concerns about an imbalance in infections 
with denosumab have largely been allayed.

When  denosumab  is  discontinued,  there  is  a  rebound  increase 
in  bone  turnover  and  an  apparent  acceleration  of  bone  loss.  This 
likely  reflects  the  maturation  of  osteoclast  precursors  that  have 
accumulated  in  marrow  when  the  drug  was  administered  and 
can  become  mature  bone  resorbing  cells  once  the  drug  is  with-
drawn. The consequences of this rebound increase in remodeling- 
associated bone loss are a rapid increase in the risk of fracture, par-
ticularly vertebral fracture, and a specific increase in the occurrence 
of multiple vertebral fractures. In patients who need to stop deno-
sumab  or  in  patients  in  whom  BMD  and  fracture  risk  reduction 
goals  have  been  met,  temporary  use  of  bisphosphonate  treatment 
may  prevent  the  rebound  increase  in  remodeling  and  rapid  bone 
loss. In clinical practice, a single infusion of zoledronic acid seems 
to maintain BMD for 1–2 years but may need to be repeated. Oral 
bisphosphonates can also be prescribed. In both cases, the required 
duration of bisphosphonate use to eliminate the rebound effect is 
not clear and may vary considerably among patients. 

Mode of Action  Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal anti-
body to RANKL, the final common effector of osteoclast formation, 
activity, and survival. Denosumab binds to RANKL, inhibiting its 
ability  to  initiate  formation  of  mature  osteoclasts  from  osteoclast 
precursors and to bring mature osteoclasts to the bone surface and 
initiate bone resorption. Denosumab also plays a role in reducing 
the survival of the osteoclast. Through these actions on the osteo-
clast, denosumab induces potent antiresorptive action, as assessed 
biochemically and histomorphometrically. 

	 •	 Parathyroid  Hormone  Endogenous 
Anabolic  Agents 
PTH  is  an  84-amino-acid  peptide  that  is  largely  responsible  for 
calcium  homeostasis  (Chap.  410).  Although  chronic  elevation  of 
PTH,  as  occurs  in  hyperparathyroidism,  is  associated  with  bone 
loss (particularly cortical bone), PTH also can exert anabolic effects 
on  bone.  Consistent  with  this,  some  observational  studies  have 
indicated that mild endogenous hyperparathyroidism is associated 
with maintenance of trabecular bone mass but loss of cortical bone. 
On the basis of these findings, early small-scale observational stud-
ies  showed  that  PTH  analogues  could  augment  trabecular  BMD. 
Subsequent  controlled  clinical  trials  have  confirmed  that  PTH 
can increase bone mass and reduce fracture occurrence. The first 
randomized  controlled  trial  in  postmenopausal  women  showed 
that  PTH  (1–34)  (teriparatide),  when  superimposed  on  ongoing 
estrogen  therapy,  produced  substantial  increments  in  bone  mass 
(13%  over  a  3-year  period  compared  with  estrogen  alone)  and 
reduced the risk of vertebral compression deformity. In the pivotal 
study  (median,  19  months’  duration),  20  μg  PTH  (1–34)  daily 
by  subcutaneous  injection  (with  no  additional  therapy)  reduced 
vertebral  fractures  by  65%  and  nonvertebral  fractures  by  40–50% 
(Fig.  411-11).  Teriparatide  produces  rapid  and  robust  increases 
in bone formation and then bone remodeling overall, resulting in 
substantial increases in bone mass and improvements in microar-
chitecture,  including  cancellous  connectivity  and  cortical  width. 
The BMD effects, particularly in the hip, are lower when patients 
switch from bisphosphonates to teriparatide, possibly in proportion 
to the potency of the antiresorptive agent. The hip BMD effect is 
particularly  impaired  when  patients  switch  from  denosumab  to 
teriparatide. In patients on denosumab who need teriparatide treat-
ment,  there  may  be  a  role  for  combination  therapy.  In  previously 
untreated  women,  teriparatide  is  administered  as  monotherapy 
and followed by a potent antiresorptive agent such as denosumab 
or  a  bisphosphonate.  Combination  therapy  is  generally  avoided

Side  effects  of  teriparatide  are  generally  mild  and  can  include 
muscle  pain,  weakness,  dizziness,  headache,  and  nausea.  Rodents 
given  prolonged  treatment  with  PTH  in  high  doses  (3–60  times 
the human dose) developed osteogenic sarcomas after ~18 months 
of  treatment.  Rare  cases  of  osteosarcoma  have  been  described  in 
patients  treated  with  teriparatide  consistent  with  the  background 
incidence of osteosarcoma in adults. Long-term surveillance studies 
of  a  high  proportion  of  patients  diagnosed  with  osteosarcoma  as 
adults  in  both  the  United  States  and  Scandinavia  reveal  no  prior 
exposure to teriparatide in any of the cases.

Teriparatide use may be limited by cost and its mode of adminis-
tration (daily subcutaneous injection). Alternative modes of delivery 
have been investigated, but none have proven successful. Because of 
the rodent osteosarcoma data and the maximum duration of teri-
paratide in the pivotal trial of 2 years, the FDA has limited teriparat-
ide treatment to 2 years, with that becoming the lifetime maximal 
use.  As  a  result,  consideration  is  often  given  to  restricting  initial 
use to 1 year (using bone density response at 1 year as a guide) and 
saving the second year for future use if necessary. 
Mode  of  Action  Exogenously  administered  PTH  appears  to 
have  direct  actions  on  osteoblast  activity,  with  biochemical  and 
histomorphometric  evidence  of  de  novo  bone  formation  within 
a  week  or  two  in  response  to  teriparatide.  There  is  subsequently 
resorption.  Subsequently,  teriparatide  activates  bone  remodeling 
but  still  appears  to  favor  bone  formation  over  bone  resorption. 
Teriparatide given by daily injection stimulates osteoblast recruit-
ment and activity through activation of Wnt signaling. Teriparatide 
produces a true increase in bone tissue and an apparent restoration 
of bone microarchitecture (Fig. 411-12). 
Abaloparatide  Abaloparatide is a synthetic analogue of human 
PTHrP, which has significant homology to PTH and also binds the 
PTH type 1 receptor. Abaloparatide and teriparatide exert different 
binding  affinities  to  the  two  different  receptor  conformations,  R0 
and RG. Compared to teriparatide, abaloparatide binds with similar 
high affinity to the RG conformation but with much lesser affinity 
to the R0 conformation. These differences appear to result in a sim-
ilar  bone  formation  stimulus  but  lesser  bone  resorption  stimulus, 
and abaloparatide was specifically chosen for development among 
a large number of PTH and PTHrP analogues for what appeared to 
be an optimized anabolic profile.

In  the  phase  3  Abaloparatide  Comparator  Trial  in  Vertebral 
Endpoints  (ACTIVE)  study,  2463  postmenopausal  women  with 
osteoporosis were randomized to blinded daily subcutaneous aba-
loparatide versus placebo or open-label teriparatide. At 18 months, 
spine BMD increase was similar with abaloparatide and teriparatide 
(11.2% abaloparatide and 10.5% teriparatide); in the total hip, BMD

because of cost and potential inhibition of the anabolic activity of 
teriparatide.

In  women  with  painful  acute  osteoporotic  vertebral  fractures, 
teriparatide reduced subsequent vertebral fractures by ~50% com-
pared  with  risedronate.  There  was  no  difference  in  nonvertebral 
fracture outcome between the two medications. A study comparing 
teriparatide  with  risedronate  in  patients  with  prevalent  vertebral 
fractures  showed  significant  benefit  for  teriparatide  against  verte-
bral fractures and nearly significant benefit for teriparatide against 
nonvertebral fractures.

increments  were  slightly  larger  with  abaloparatide  (4.2  vs  3.3%). 
New vertebral fracture incidence was reduced by 86% with abalo-
paratide  and  80%  with  teriparatide  compared  with  placebo  (both   
p <.001). The hazard ratio for abaloparatide versus teriparatide was 
not quoted. Nonvertebral fractures were reduced by 43% with aba-
loparatide (p = .05) and by 28% with teriparatide (not significant; 
p  =  .22).  The  ACTIVE  study  was  extended,  with  92%  of  eligible 
participants from the abaloparatide and placebo arms transitioned 
to open-label alendronate for a total treatment period of 24 months 
of alendronate. Both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were less 
common in the group who transitioned from abaloparatide to alen-
dronate, suggesting that the fracture benefit of abaloparatide can be 
maintained with antiresorptive treatment. 
Romosozumab  Romosozumab  is  a  humanized  antibody  that 
blocks  the  osteocyte  production  of  sclerostin,  resulting  in  an 
increase  in  bone  formation  and  decline  in  bone  resorption.  In 
the  pivotal  trial  (FRAME),  7180  postmenopausal  women  with 
osteoporosis were randomized to receive blinded monthly subcu-
taneous romosozumab (210 mg) or placebo for 1 year followed by 
transition  to  open-label  subcutaneous  denosumab  (60  mg)  every 
6 months for an additional year. BMD increased over 13% in the 
spine  and  almost  7%  in  the  hip  in  1  year  with  romosozumab.  At   
1 year, the incidence of new vertebral fractures in the romosozumab 
group  was  significantly  reduced  by  73%  compared  with  placebo. 
Clinical fracture risk (nonvertebral fractures and clinical vertebral 
fractures  combined)  was  significantly  reduced  by  36%.  Nonver-
tebral  fractures  were  also  reduced,  but  the  difference  just  missed 
statistical  significance  perhaps  due  to  geographical  differences;  in 
the  high-enrolling  Latin  American  region,  there  was  no  signifi-
cant  reduction  in  nonvertebral  fractures,  probably  due  to  a  very 
low background incidence in that region. In the rest of the world, 
nonvertebral fractures were significantly reduced by >40%. During 
the second year of the FRAME study, both groups transitioned to 
denosumab.  Over  24  months,  women  who  had  received  romoso-
zumab during the first 12 months and then denosumab had 75% 
fewer new vertebral fractures than those who had received placebo 
for a year followed by denosumab. There were also nearly signifi-
cant  trends  toward  reduced  clinical  and  nonvertebral  fractures  in 
the  romosozumab/denosumab  group.  Compared  with  baseline, 
BMD increased by 17.6% in the spine and 8.8% in the total hip in 
the romosozumab/denosumab group. Safety and tolerability of the 
two drugs were similar, with a slightly higher incidence of injection 
site  reactions  in  the  denosumab  group.  The  FRAME  study  is  in 
an  ongoing  extension  where  all  participants  received  continued 
denosumab for an additional year. A parallel trial of very-high-risk 
patients,  all  of  whom  have  prevalent  vertebral  fractures,  is  also 
ongoing and is comparing romosozumab to alendronate for 1 year, 
followed by transition to or continuation of alendronate for 2 addi-
tional years. In one study, there was an increase in cardiovascular 
side effects prompting a warning on the label. 
OTHER PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS NOT APPROVED IN THE 
UNITED STATES
Odanacatib,  a  cathepsin  K  inhibitor,  inhibits  the  osteoclast  col-
lagenase  enzyme,  preventing  bone  resorption  but  not  affecting 
osteoclast viability. This agent was in late-stage drug development. 
In  a  very  large  controlled  clinical  trial  (~17,000  postmenopausal 
women  with  osteoporosis),  bone  mass  increased  substantially  in 
the spine and hip, and vertebral, hip, and all nonvertebral fractures 
were  reduced.  Unfortunately,  odanacatib  was  associated  with  a 
significantly increased risk of stroke, and the development of this 
agent was aborted in September 2016.

Testosterone has been used to treat osteoporosis associated with 
low testosterone levels in men. There are data that indicate that tes-
tosterone can increase bone density, but there are no data indicating 
improvement in any fracture endpoints. Since there are many other 
effects of testosterone, especially in older men (including prostate 
hypertrophy), decisions to use it for treatment of osteoporosis have 
to take the multisystemic effects into account.

Sodium fluoride was tested in two large parallel clinical trials in 
the late 1980s. Although BMD increased substantially, the increase 
was  in  part  due  to  fluoride  incorporation  in  the  hydroxyapatite 
crystal.  Fracture  risk  was  not  reduced  and,  in  fact,  was  increased 
in nonvertebral sites. Therefore, fluoride is no longer considered a 
viable option for osteoporosis treatment.

Strontium ranelate has never been approved for osteoporosis in 
the United States but is approved in Europe and some other coun-
tries outside of the United States. It increases bone mass throughout 
the skeleton, but much of the increase is related to strontium incor-
poration into hydroxyapatite. In clinical trials, the drug reduced the 
risk of vertebral fractures by 37% and that of nonvertebral fractures 
by 14%. It appears to be modestly antiresorptive while at the same 
time not causing as much of a decrease in bone formation (mea-
sured biochemically). In 2014, the use of strontium was restricted 
because  of  an  increased  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease  and  severe 
skin  reactions.  Small  increased  risks  of  venous  thrombosis  also 
occur.

Several small studies of growth hormone, alone or in combina-
tion  with  other  agents,  have  not  shown  consistent  or  substantial 
positive effects on skeletal mass. 
NONPHARMACOLOGIC APPROACHES
Protective  pads  worn  around  the  outer  thigh,  which  cover  the 
trochanteric region of the hip, can prevent hip fractures in elderly 
residents  in  nursing  homes.  The  use  of  hip  protectors  is  limited 
largely  by  issues  of  compliance  and  comfort,  but  new  devices  are 
being developed that may circumvent these problems and provide 
adjunctive treatments.

Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are also useful nonpharmacologic 
approaches for the treatment of painful vertebral fractures. The data 
do not support routine surgical intervention for vertebral fractures 
since, while this can reduce pain, there is concern about long-term 
vertebral fracture risk. 
TREATMENT MONITORING
There  are  currently  no  well-accepted  guidelines  for  monitoring 
treatment  of  osteoporosis.  Because  most  osteoporosis  treatments 
produce small or moderate bone mass increments on average, it is 
reasonable  to  consider  BMD  as  a  monitoring  tool.  Changes  must 
exceed  ~4%  in  the  spine  and  6%  in  the  hip  to  be  considered  sig-
nificant in any individual. The hip is the preferred site due to larger 
surface area and greater reproducibility. Medication-induced incre-
ments may require several years to produce changes of this magni-
tude (if they do at all). Consequently, it can be argued that BMD 
should  be  repeated  at  intervals  of  every  2  years.  Only  significant 
BMD reductions should prompt a change in medical regimen, as it 
is expected that many individuals will not show responses greater 
than the detection limits of the current measurement techniques.

Biochemical  markers  of  bone  turnover  can  help  in  treatment 
monitoring, with significant changes seen within 3 months of initi-
ating treatment with approved medications and the possible benefit 
of improving adherence. It remains unclear which endpoint is most 
useful. If bone turnover markers are used, a determination should 
be made before therapy is started and repeated ≥3–4 months after 
therapy is initiated. In general, a change in bone turnover markers 
must be 30–40% lower than the baseline to be significant because of 
the biologic and technical variability in these tests. Because markers 
change more rapidly than bone density, they are often early signs 
of treatment effect. Currently collagen C-telopeptide measured on 
a fasting serum sample in the morning is the preferred marker of 
bone  resorption,  and  osteocalcin  or  the  propeptide  of  type  1  col-
lagen (P1NP) is the preferred marker for formation.

GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED 
OSTEOPOROSIS
Osteoporotic  fractures  are  a  well-characterized  consequence  of  the 
hypercortisolism  associated  with  Cushing’s  syndrome.  However,  the 
therapeutic  use  of  glucocorticoids  is  by  far  the  most  common  form

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismof  glucocorticoid-induced  osteoporosis  (GCIO).  Glucocorticoids  are 
used widely in the treatment of a variety of disorders, including chronic 
lung  disorders,  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  other  connective  tissue 
diseases,  and  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  and  after  transplantation. 
Osteoporosis  and  related  fractures  are  serious  side  effects  of  chronic 
glucocorticoid  therapy.  Because  the  effects  of  glucocorticoids  on  the 
skeleton  are  often  superimposed  on  the  consequences  of  aging  and 
menopause, it is not surprising that women and the elderly are most 
frequently  affected.  The  skeletal  response  to  steroids  is  remarkably 
heterogeneous, however, and even young, growing individuals treated 
with glucocorticoids can present with fractures.

The  risk  of  fractures  depends  on  the  dose  and  duration  of  gluco-
corticoid  therapy,  although  recent  data  suggest  that  there  may  be  no 
completely safe dose. Bone loss is more rapid during the early months 
of treatment, and trabecular bone is affected more severely than cor-
tical  bone.  As  a  result,  fractures  have  been  shown  to  increase  within 
3 months of steroid treatment. There is an increase in fracture risk in 
both the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton, including risk of 
hip fracture. Bone loss can occur with any route of steroid administra-
tion,  including  high-dose  inhaled  glucocorticoids  and  intra-articular 
injections.  Alternate-day  delivery  does  not  appear  to  ameliorate  the 
skeletal effects of glucocorticoids.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Glucocorticoids increase bone loss by multiple mechanisms, includ-
ing (1) inhibition of osteoblast function and an increase in osteoblast 
apoptosis, resulting in impaired synthesis of new bone; (2) stimula-
tion  of  bone  resorption,  probably  as  a  secondary  effect;  (3)  impair-
ment  of  the  absorption  of  calcium  across  the  intestine,  probably  by 
a vitamin D–independent effect; (4) increase of urinary calcium loss 
and  perhaps  induction  of  some  degree  of  secondary  hyperparathy-
roidism; (5) reduction of adrenal androgens and suppression of ovarian 
and testicular secretion of estrogens and androgens; and (6) induction 
of glucocorticoid myopathy, which may exacerbate effects on skeletal 
and calcium homeostasis as well as increase the risk of falls.
 ■ EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT
Because of the prevalence of GCIO, it is important to evaluate the sta-
tus of the skeleton in all patients starting or already receiving long-term 
glucocorticoid  therapy.  Modifiable  risk  factors  should  be  identified, 
including those for falls. Examination should include testing of height 
and muscle strength. Laboratory evaluation should include an assess-
ment of 24-h urinary calcium. All patients on long-term (>3 months) 
glucocorticoids  should  have  measurement  of  bone  mass  at  both  the 
spine and the hip using DXA. If only one skeletal site can be measured, 
it  is  best  to  assess  the  spine  in  individuals  <60  years  and  the  hip  in 
those >60 years.
 ■ PREVENTION
Bone  loss  caused  by  glucocorticoids  can  be  prevented,  and  the  risk 
of  fractures  significantly  reduced.  Strategies  must  include  using  the 
lowest  dose  of  glucocorticoid  for  disease  management.  Topical  and 
inhaled routes of administration are preferred, where appropriate. Risk 
factor reduction is important, including smoking cessation, limitation 
of alcohol consumption, and participation in weight-bearing and resis-
tance  exercise,  when  appropriate.  All  patients  should  receive  an  ade-
quate calcium and vitamin D intake from the diet or from supplements.

TREATMENT
Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Several bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic 
acid) have been demonstrated in large clinical trials to reduce the 
risk of fractures in patients being treated with glucocorticoids and 
are FDA approved for the treatment of GCIO. Teriparatide is also 
approved for treatment of GCIO. In one trial comparing teriparat-
ide  to  alendronate,  BMD  increases  were  much  greater  and  verte-
bral  fracture  risk  reduction  far  more  substantial  with  teriparatide 
compared to alendronate. A study of denosumab indicates greater 

efficacy  of  denosumab  compared  with  risedronate  for  treatment 
of  GCIO.  The  American  College  of  Rheumatology  has  published 
guidelines for the management of GCIO.

412 Paget’s Disease and Other 
Dysplasias of Bone
Rajesh K. Jain, Tamara J. Vokes

PAGET’S DISEASE OF BONE
Paget’s  disease  is  a  localized  bone-remodeling  disorder  that  affects 
widespread, noncontiguous areas of the skeleton. The pathologic pro-
cess is initiated by overactive osteoclastic bone resorption followed by 
a compensatory increase in osteoblastic new bone formation, resulting 
in  a  structurally  disorganized  mosaic  of  woven  and  lamellar  bone. 
Pagetic bone is expanded, less compact, and more vascular; thus, it is 
more susceptible to deformities and fractures. Although most patients 
are asymptomatic, symptoms resulting directly from bony involvement 
(bone  pain,  secondary  arthritis,  fractures)  or  secondarily  from  the 
expansion of bone causing compression of surrounding neural tissue 
are not uncommon.

Epidemiology  There  is  a  marked  geographic  variation  in  the 
frequency of Paget’s disease, with high prevalence in Western Europe 
(Great Britain, France, and Germany, but not Switzerland or Scandinavia) 
and  among  those  who  have  immigrated  to  Australia,  New  Zealand, 
South  Africa,  and  North  and  South  America.  The  disease  is  rare  in 
native populations of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East; 
when  it  does  occur,  the  affected  subjects  usually  have  evidence  of 
European ancestry, supporting the migration theory. For unclear reasons, 
the prevalence and severity of Paget’s disease are decreasing, and the 
age of diagnosis is increasing.

The prevalence is greater in males and increases with age. Autopsy 
series reveal Paget’s disease in ~3% of those over age 40. Prevalence of 
positive skeletal radiographs in patients aged >55 years is 2.5% for men 
and  1.6%  for  women.  Elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP)  levels  in 
asymptomatic patients have an age-adjusted incidence of 12.7 and 7 per 
100,000 person-years in men and women, respectively.

Etiology  The etiology of Paget’s disease of bone remains unknown, 
but  evidence  supports  both  genetic  and  viral  etiologies.  A  positive

FIGURE  412-1  Diagram  illustrating  factors  that  promote  differentiation  and 
function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts and the role of the RANK pathway. Stromal 
bone marrow (mesenchymal) cells and differentiated osteoblasts produce multiple 
growth  factors  and  cytokines,  including  macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor 
(M-CSF),  to  modulate  osteoclastogenesis.  RANKL  (receptor  activator  of  nuclear 
factor-κB  [NF-κB]  ligand)  is  produced  by  osteoblast  progenitors  and  mature 
osteoblasts  and  can  bind  to  a  soluble  decoy  receptor  known  as  osteoprotegerin 
(OPG)  to  inhibit  RANKL  action.  Alternatively,  a  cell-cell  interaction  between 
osteoblast  and  osteoclast  progenitors  allows  RANKL  to  bind  to  its  membrane-
bound receptor, RANK, thereby stimulating osteoclast differentiation and function. 
RANK binds intracellular proteins called tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated 
factors (TRAFs) that mediate receptor signaling through transcription factors such 
as NF-κB. M-CSF binds to its receptor, c-fms, which is the cellular homologue of 
the fms oncogene. See text for the potential role of these pathways in disorders 
of osteoclast function such as Paget’s disease and osteopetrosis. IGF, insulin-like 
growth factor; IL, interleukin.

family history is found in 15–25% of patients and, when present, raises 
the  prevalence  of  the  disease  seven-  to  tenfold  among  first-degree 
relatives.

A  clear  genetic  basis  has  been  established  for  several  rare  familial 
bone  disorders  that  clinically  and  radiographically  resemble  Paget’s 
disease but have more severe presentation and earlier onset. A homozy-
gous deletion of the TNFRSF11B gene, which encodes osteoprotegrin 
(Fig.  412-1),  causes  juvenile  Paget’s  disease,  also  known  as  familial 
idiopathic hyperphosphatasia, a disorder characterized by uncontrolled 
osteoclastic differentiation and resorption. Familial patterns of disease 
in  several  large  kindred  are  consistent  with  an  autosomal  dominant 
pattern  of  inheritance  with  variable  penetrance.  Familial  expansile 
osteolysis,  expansile  skeletal  hyperphosphatasia,  and  early-onset  Paget’s 
disease are associated with mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene, which 
encodes RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB), a member of 
the tumor necrosis factor superfamily critical for osteoclast differenti-
ation (Fig. 412-1). A mutation in profilin 1, a small actin protein that 
acts as a tumor suppressor, also causes early-onset Paget’s disease with 
a predisposition for the development of osteosarcoma. Finally, muta-
tions in the gene for valosin-containing protein cause a rare syndrome 
with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable penetrance known 
as  inclusion  body  myopathy  with  Paget’s  disease  and  frontotemporal 
dementia  (IBMPFD).  The  role  of  genetic  factors  is  less  clear  in  the 
more common form of late-onset Paget’s disease. The most common 
mutations  identified  in  familial  and  sporadic  cases  of  Paget’s  disease 
have  been  in  the  SQSTM1  gene  (sequestasome-1  or  p62  protein)  in 
the C-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain. The other candidate genes 
include  CSF1  (1p13),  which  encodes  macrophage  colony-stimulating 
factor (M-CSF), a cytokine that is required for osteoclast differentia-
tion;  RIN3  (14q32),  which  encodes  a  guanine  exchange  factor  called 
Rab and Ras interactor 3; OPTN (10p13), which is involved in regu-
lating  nuclear  factor  (NF)-κB;  TNFRSF11A  (18q21),  which  encodes 

receptor  activator  of  NF-κB  (RANK),  a  receptor  that  is  essential  for 
osteoclast  differentiation;  and  TM7SF4,  which  encodes  dendritic 
cell–specific  transmembrane  protein  (DC-STAMP),  a  molecule  that 
is  essential  for  fusion  of  the  osteoclast.  The  phenotypic  variability  in 
patients with SQSTM1 mutations suggests that additional factors, such 
as  other  genetic  influences  or  viral  infection,  may  influence  clinical 
expression of the disease.

Several lines of evidence suggest that a viral infection may contrib-
ute  to  the  clinical  manifestations  of  Paget’s  disease,  including  (1)  the 
presence of cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions resembling paramyxo-
viruses (measles and respiratory syncytial virus) in pagetic osteoclasts 
and  (2)  viral  mRNA  in  precursor  and  mature  osteoclasts.  The  viral 
etiology  is  further  supported  by  conversion  of  osteoclast  precursors 
to  pagetic-like  osteoclasts  by  vectors  containing  the  measles  virus 
nucleocapsid or matrix genes. The decline in the incidence of Paget’s 
disease coincides with the widespread vaccination against measles, also 
consistent with the potential role of virus in the development of the dis-
ease. However, the viral etiology has been questioned by the inability to 
culture a live virus from pagetic bone and by failure to clone the full-
length  viral  genes  from  material  obtained  from  patients  with  Paget’s 
disease. Furthermore, patients with Paget’s disease do not have higher 
antibody  levels  against  paramyxoviruses  or  measles  as  compared  to 
controls, nor do antibody levels correlate with disease severity in those 
with Paget’s disease.

Pathophysiology  The  principal  abnormality  in  Paget’s  disease  is 
the  increased  number  and  activity  of  osteoclasts.  Pagetic  osteoclasts 
are large, increased 10- to 100-fold in number, and have a greater num-
ber  of  nuclei  (as  many  as  100  compared  to  3–5  nuclei  in  the  normal 
osteoclast). The overactive osteoclasts may create a sevenfold increase 
in resorptive surfaces and an erosion rate of 9 μg/d (normal is 1 μg/d). 
Several causes for the increased number and activity of pagetic osteo-
clasts  have  been  identified:  (1)  osteoclastic  precursors  are  hypersen-
sitive  to  1,25(OH)2D3;  (2)  osteoclasts  are  hyperresponsive  to  RANK 
ligand  (RANKL),  the  osteoclast  stimulatory  factor  that  mediates  the 
effects of most osteotropic factors on osteoclast formation; (3) marrow 
stromal cells from pagetic lesions have increased RANKL expression; 
(4) osteoclast precursor recruitment is increased by interleukin (IL) 6, 
which is increased in the blood of patients with active Paget’s disease 
and is overexpressed in pagetic osteoclasts; (5) expression of the pro-
tooncogene c-fos, which increases osteoclastic activity, is increased; and 
(6) the antiapoptotic oncogene Bcl-2 in pagetic bone is overexpressed. 
Numerous osteoblasts are recruited to active resorption sites and pro-
duce large amounts of new bone matrix. As a result, bone turnover is 
high, and bone mass is normal or increased, not reduced, unless there 
is concomitant deficiency of calcium and/or vitamin D.

The characteristic feature of Paget’s disease is increased bone resorp-
tion accompanied by accelerated bone formation. An initial osteolytic 
phase involves prominent bone resorption and marked hypervascular-
ization. Radiographically, this manifests as an advancing lytic wedge, 
or “blade of grass” lesion. The second phase is a period of very active 
bone  formation  and  resorption  that  replaces  normal  lamellar  bone 
with haphazard (woven) bone. Fibrous connective tissue may replace 
normal  bone  marrow.  In  the  final  sclerotic  phase,  bone  resorption 
declines progressively and leads to a hard, dense, less vascular pagetic 
or  mosaic  bone,  which  represents  the  so-called  burned-out  phase  of 
Paget’s  disease.  All  three  phases  may  be  present  at  the  same  time  at 
different skeletal sites.

Clinical  Manifestations  Diagnosis  is  often  made  in  asymptom-
atic  patients  because  they  have  elevated  ALP  levels  on  routine  blood 
chemistry testing or an abnormality on a skeletal radiograph obtained 
for  another  indication.  The  skeletal  sites  most  commonly  involved 
are the pelvis, vertebral bodies, skull, femur, and tibia. Familial cases 
with an early presentation often have numerous active sites of skeletal 
involvement.

The most common presenting symptom is pain, which may result 
from  increased  bony  vascularity,  expanding  lytic  lesions,  fractures, 
bowing,  or  other  deformities.  Bowing  of  the  femur  or  tibia  causes

gait  abnormalities  and  abnormal  mechanical  stresses  with  secondary 
osteoarthritis of the hip or knee joints. Long bone bowing also causes 
extremity pain by stretching the muscles attached to the bone softened 
by  the  pagetic  process.  Back  pain  results  from  enlarged  pagetic  ver-
tebrae,  vertebral  compression  fractures,  spinal  stenosis,  degenerative 
changes of the joints, and altered body mechanics with kyphosis and 
forward  tilt  of  the  upper  back.  Rarely,  spinal  cord  compression  may 
result  from  bone  enlargement  or  from  the  vascular  steal  syndrome. 
Skull  involvement  may  cause  headaches,  symmetric  or  asymmetric 
enlargement  of  the  parietal  or  frontal  bones  (frontal  bossing),  and 
increased head size. Cranial expansion may narrow cranial foramens 
and  cause  neurologic  complications  including  hearing  loss  from 
cochlear nerve damage from temporal bone involvement, cranial nerve 
palsies, and softening of the base of the skull (platybasia) with the risk 
of brainstem compression. Pagetic involvement of the facial bones may 
cause facial deformity; loss of teeth and other dental conditions; and, 
rarely, airway compression.

Fractures  are  serious  complications  of  Paget’s  disease  and  usually 
occur in long bones at areas of active or advancing lytic lesions. Com-
mon fracture sites are the femoral shaft and subtrochanteric regions. 
Neoplasms arising from pagetic bone are rare (<0.5%). The incidence 
of sarcoma appears to be decreasing, possibly because of earlier, more 
effective treatment with potent antiresorptive agents. The majority of 
tumors are osteosarcomas, which usually present with new pain in a 
long-standing pagetic lesion. Osteoclast-rich benign giant cell tumors 
may arise in areas adjacent to pagetic bone, and they respond to glu-
cocorticoid therapy.

Cardiovascular  complications  may  occur  in  patients  with  involve-
ment of large (15–35%) portions of the skeleton and a high degree of 
disease  activity  (ALP  four  times  above  normal).  The  extensive  arte-
riovenous  shunting  and  marked  increases  in  blood  flow  through  the 
vascular pagetic bone lead to a high-output state and cardiac enlarge-
ment. However, high-output heart failure is relatively rare and usually 
develops in patients with concomitant cardiac pathology. In addition, 
calcific  aortic  stenosis  and  diffuse  vascular  calcifications  have  been 
associated with Paget’s disease.

Diagnosis  The diagnosis may be suggested on clinical examination 
by the presence of an enlarged skull with frontal bossing, bowing of an 
extremity, or short stature with simian posturing. An extremity with an 
area of warmth and tenderness to palpation may suggest an underlying 
pagetic  lesion.  Other  findings  include  bony  deformity  of  the  pelvis, 
skull, spine, and extremities; arthritic involvement of the joints adja-
cent to lesions; and leg-length discrepancy resulting from deformities 
of the long bones.

Paget’s disease is usually diagnosed from radiologic and biochem-
ical  abnormalities.  Radiographic  findings  typical  of  Paget’s  disease 

include enlargement or expansion of an entire bone or area of a long 
bone,  cortical  thickening,  coarsening  of  trabecular  markings,  and 
typical  lytic  and  sclerotic  changes.  Skull  radiographs  (Fig.  412-2) 
reveal  regions  of  “cotton  wool,”  or  osteoporosis  circumscripta,  thick-
ening of diploic areas, and enlargement and sclerosis of a portion or 
all  of  one  or  more  skull  bones.  Vertebral  cortical  thickening  of  the 
superior  and  inferior  end  plates  creates  a  “picture  frame”  vertebra. 
Diffuse  radiodense  enlargement  of  a  vertebra  is  referred  to  as  “ivory 
vertebra.” Pelvic radiographs may demonstrate disruption or fusion of 
the sacroiliac joints; porotic and radiodense lesions of the ilium with 
whorls  of  coarse  trabeculation;  thickened  and  sclerotic  iliopectineal 
line  (brim  sign);  and  softening  with  protrusio  acetabuli,  with  axial 
migration of the hips and functional flexion contracture. Radiographs 
of long bones reveal bowing deformity and typical pagetic changes of 
cortical thickening and expansion and areas of lucency and sclerosis 
(Fig.  412-3).  Radionuclide  99mTc  bone  scans  are  less  specific  but  are 
more sensitive than standard radiographs for identifying sites of active 
skeletal lesions. Although computed tomography (CT) and magnetic 
resonance  imaging  (MRI)  studies  are  not  necessary  in  most  cases, 
CT  may  be  useful  for  the  assessment  of  possible  fracture,  and  MRI 
is necessary to assess the possibility of sarcoma, giant cell tumor, or

3212 metastatic disease in pagetic bone. Definitive diagnosis of malignancy 

often requires bone biopsy.

Biochemical evaluation is useful in the diagnosis and management 
of Paget’s disease. The marked increase in bone turnover can be mon-
itored  using  biochemical  markers  of  bone  formation  and  resorption. 
The parallel rise in markers of bone formation and resorption confirms 
the coupling of bone formation and resorption in Paget’s disease. The 
degree of bone marker elevation reflects the extent and severity of the 
disease. For most patients, serum total ALP remains the test of choice 
both  for  diagnosis  and  assessing  response  to  therapy.  Occasionally,  a 
symptomatic patient with evidence of progression at a single site may 
have  a  normal  total  ALP  level  but  increased  bone-specific  ALP.  For 
unclear reasons, serum osteocalcin, another marker of bone formation, 
is not always elevated and is not recommended for use in diagnosis or 
management  of  Paget’s  disease.  In  contrast,  bone  formation  marker 
P1NP does reflect the activity of the disease and can be used instead 
of total ALP. Bone resorption markers (serum or urine N-telopeptide 
or C-telopeptide measured in the blood or urine) are also elevated in 
active Paget’s disease and decrease more rapidly in response to therapy 
than does ALP.

Serum calcium and phosphate levels are normal in Paget’s disease. 
Immobilization of a patient with active Paget’s disease may rarely cause 
hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria and increase the risk for nephrolith-
iasis. However, the discovery of hypercalcemia, even in the presence of 
immobilization, should prompt a search for another cause of hypercal-
cemia. In contrast, hypocalcemia or mild secondary hyperparathyroid-
ism  may  develop  in  Paget’s  patients  with  very  active  bone  formation 
and  insufficient  calcium  and  vitamin  D  intake,  particularly  during 
bisphosphonate  therapy  when  bone  resorption  is  rapidly  suppressed 
and  active  bone  formation  continues.  Therefore,  adequate  calcium 
and vitamin D intake should be instituted prior to administration of 
bisphosphonates.

TREATMENT
Paget’s Disease of Bone

The  development  of  effective  and  potent  pharmacologic  agents 
(Table 412-1) has changed the treatment philosophy from treating 
only symptomatic patients to treating asymptomatic patients who 
are  at  risk  for  complications.  According  to  the  Endocrine  Society 
Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  published  in  2014,  pharmacologic 
therapy  is  indicated  for  most  patients  with  active  Paget’s  disease 
who  are  at  risk  of  complications.  Treatment  may  be  initiated  to 
control  symptoms  caused  by  metabolically  active  Paget’s  disease 
such as bone pain, fracture, headache, pain from pagetic radiculop-
athy or arthropathy, or neurologic complications; to decrease local 
blood flow and minimize operative blood loss in patients who need 
surgery at an active pagetic site; to reduce hypercalciuria that may 
occur  during  immobilization;  and  to  decrease  the  risk  of  compli-
cations when disease activity is high (elevated ALP) and when the 
site of involvement involves weight-bearing bones, areas adjacent to

therapy  prevents  late  complications  remains  to  be  determined. 
Randomized studies from the United Kingdom showed no differ-
ence in bone pain, fracture rates, quality of life, and hearing loss 
between  patients  who  received  pharmacologic  therapy  to  control 
symptoms  (bone  pain)  and  those  receiving  bisphosphonates  to 
normalize  serum  ALP.  However,  the  conclusions  of  these  studies 
are  debatable  since  the  majority  of  subjects  had  already  received 
bisphosphonate  therapy  in  the  past,  perhaps  limiting  generaliz-
ability,  and  because  the  bone  deformities  that  occur  with  Paget’s 
disease  may  take  many  years  to  manifest.  It  seems  likely  that  the 
restoration  of  normal  bone  architecture  following  suppression  of 
pagetic activity will prevent further deformities and complications.
Agents  approved  for  treatment  of  Paget’s  disease  suppress  the 
very  high  rates  of  bone  resorption  and  secondarily  decrease  the 
high rates of bone formation (Table 412-1). As a result of decreasing 
bone turnover, pagetic structural patterns, including areas of poorly 
mineralized woven bone, are replaced by more normal cancellous 
or lamellar bone. Reduced bone turnover can be documented by a 
decline in serum formation markers (ALP and P1NP) and urine or 
serum resorption markers (N-telopeptide, C-telopeptide).

Bisphosphonates are the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy of 
Paget’s  disease.  Among  them,  zoledronic  acid  is  currently  recom-
mended as the first choice, particularly for those who have severe 
disease or need rapid normalization of bone turnover (neurologic 
symptoms, severe bone pain due to a lytic lesion, risk of an impend-
ing fracture, or pretreatment prior to elective surgery in an area of 
active  disease).  Zoledronic  acid  normalized  bone  turnover  faster 
and  in  a  high  proportion  of  patients  (>90%)  than  oral  bisphos-
phonates with the therapeutic effect persisting for months or even 
years. It is given at a dose of 5 mg as an intravenous infusion over 
20  min,  although  slower  rates  of  infusion  are  recommended  for 
elderly or those with mild impairment of renal function. More sig-
nificant renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate <35 mL/min) 
is a contraindication for use of zoledronic acid due to higher risk of 
further deterioration of renal function. About 20–25% of patients 
experience a flulike syndrome after the first infusion, which can be 
partly ameliorated by pretreatment with acetaminophen or nonste-
roidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs).  Oral  bisphosphonates, 
alendronate and risedronate, can be used in subjects who have mild 
disease or some degree of renal impairment. Oral bisphosphonates 
should be taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, 
followed by maintenance of upright posture with no food, drink, or 
other medications for 30–60 min. The first clinically useful agent, 
etidronate, is no longer used due to its low potency and higher risk 
of  inducing  osteomalacia.  The  efficacy  of  different  agents,  based 
on their ability to normalize or decrease ALP levels, is summarized 
in  Table  412-1,  although  the  response  rates  are  not  comparable 
because they are obtained from different studies.

The  subcutaneous  injectable  form  of  salmon  calcitonin  is 
approved for the treatment of Paget’s disease but is rarely used due 
to its low potency and should be reserved for patients who either 
do not tolerate bisphosphonates or have a contraindication to their 
use. For patients with contraindication to bisphosphonates, another 
alternative is denosumab, an antibody to RANKL, which has been 
reported  to  result  in  reduction  in  ALP.  However,  it  has  not  been 
approved for this indication and has less complete and less durable 
effect than bisphosphonates.

SCLEROSING BONE DISORDERS
 ■ OSTEOPETROSIS
Osteopetrosis  refers  to  a  group  of  disorders  caused  by  severe  impair-
ment  of  osteoclast-mediated  bone  resorption.  Other  terms  that  are 
often used include marble bone disease, which captures the solid x-ray 
appearance  of  the  involved  skeleton,  and  Albers-Schonberg  disease, 
which  refers  to  the  milder,  adult  form  of  osteopetrosis  also  known 
as  autosomal  dominant  osteopetrosis  type  II.  The  major  types  of

osteopetrosis include malignant (severe, infantile, autosomal recessive) 
osteopetrosis  and  benign  (adult,  autosomal  dominant)  osteopetrosis 
types I and II. A rare autosomal recessive intermediate form has a more 
benign  prognosis.  Autosomal  recessive  carbonic  anhydrase  (CA)  II 
deficiency  produces  osteopetrosis  of  intermediate  severity  associated 
with renal tubular acidosis and cerebral calcification.

Etiology  and  Genetics  Naturally  occurring  and  gene-knockout 
animal models with phenotypes similar to those of the human disorders 
have been used to explore the genetic basis of osteopetrosis. The pri-
mary defect in osteopetrosis is the loss of osteoclastic bone resorption 
and preservation of normal osteoblastic bone formation. Osteoprote-
gerin (OPG) is a soluble decoy receptor that binds osteoblast-derived 
RANK ligand, which mediates osteoclast differentiation and activation 
(Fig. 412-1). Transgenic mice that overexpress OPG develop osteopet-
rosis, presumably by blocking RANK ligand. Mice deficient in RANK 
lack osteoclasts and develop severe osteopetrosis.

Recessive mutations of CA II prevent osteoclasts from generating an 
acid environment in the clear zone between its ruffled border and the 
adjacent mineral surface. Absence of CA II, therefore, impairs osteo-
clastic bone resorption. Other forms of human disease have less clear 
genetic defects. About one-half of the patients with malignant infantile 
osteopetrosis have a mutation in the TCIRG1 gene encoding the osteo-
clast-specific subunit of the vacuolar proton pump, which mediates the 
acidification of the interface between bone mineral and the osteoclast 
ruffled border. Mutations in the CLCN7 chloride channel gene cause 
autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II.

Clinical Presentation  The incidence of autosomal recessive severe 
(malignant) osteopetrosis ranges from 1 in 200,000 to 1 in 500,000 live 
births. As bone and cartilage fail to undergo modeling, paralysis of one 
or more cranial nerves may occur due to narrowing of the cranial fora-
mens. Failure of skeletal modeling also results in inadequate marrow 
space,  leading  to  extramedullary  hematopoiesis  with  hypersplenism 
and  pancytopenia.  Hypocalcemia  due  to  lack  of  osteoclastic  bone 
resorption  may  occur  in  infants  and  young  children.  The  untreated 
infantile disease is fatal, often before age 5.

Adult  (benign)  osteopetrosis  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disease 
that  is  usually  diagnosed  by  the  discovery  of  typical  skeletal  changes 
in  young  adults  who  undergo  radiologic  evaluation  of  a  fracture. 
The  prevalence  is  1  in  100,000  to  1  in  500,000  adults.  The  course  is 
not always benign, because fractures may be accompanied by loss of 
vision,  deafness,  psychomotor  delay,  mandibular  osteomyelitis,  and 
other complications usually associated with the juvenile form. In some 
kindred, nonpenetrance results in skip generations, while in other fam-
ilies, severely affected children are born into families with benign dis-
ease. The milder form of the disease does not usually require treatment.

Radiography  Typically, there are generalized symmetric increases 
in  bone  mass  with  thickening  of  both  cortical  and  trabecular  bone. 
Diaphyses and metaphyses are broadened, and alternating sclerotic and 
lucent bands may be seen in the iliac crests, at the ends of long bones, 
and in vertebral bodies. The cranium is usually thickened, particularly 
at  the  base  of  the  skull,  and  the  paranasal  and  mastoid  sinuses  are 
underpneumatized.

Laboratory  Findings  The  only  significant  laboratory  findings 
are  elevated  serum  levels  of  osteoclast-derived  tartrate-resistant  acid 
phosphatase  (TRAP)  and  the  brain  isoenzyme  of  creatine  kinase. 
Serum calcium may be low in severe disease, and parathyroid hormone 
and  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D  levels  may  be  elevated  in  response  to 
hypocalcemia.

TREATMENT
Osteopetrosis

Allogeneic  human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)–identical  bone  mar-
row  transplantation  has  been  successful  in  some  children.  Fol-
lowing  transplantation,  the  marrow  contains  progenitor  cells  and 
normally  functioning  osteoclasts.  With  long-term  follow-up  after 

transplantation, radiographic improvements, such as improvements 
in  Erlenmeyer  flask  deformities,  are  seen,  although  there  is  not 
complete  normalization.  A  cure  is  most  likely  when  children  are 
transplanted before age 4. Marrow transplantation from noniden-
tical HLA-matched donors has a much higher failure rate. Limited 
studies in small numbers of patients have suggested variable benefits 
following treatment with interferon γ-1β, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 
(which stimulates osteoclasts directly), methylprednisolone, and a 
low-calcium/high-phosphate diet.

Surgical  intervention  is  indicated  to  decompress  optic  or  audi-
tory  nerve  compression.  Orthopedic  management  is  required  for 
the surgical treatment of fractures and their complications, includ-
ing malunion and postfracture deformity.

 ■ PYKNODYSOSTOSIS
This  is  an  autosomal  recessive  form  of  osteosclerosis  that  is  believed 
to  have  affected  the  French  impressionist  painter  Henri  de  Toulouse- 
Lautrec.  The  molecular  basis  involves  mutations  in  the  gene  that 
encodes cathepsin K, a lysosomal metalloproteinase highly expressed 
in osteoclasts and important for bone-matrix degradation. Osteoclasts 
are present but do not function normally. Pyknodysostosis is a form of 
short-limb dwarfism that presents with frequent fractures but usually a 
normal life span. Clinical features include short stature; kyphoscoliosis 
and deformities of the chest; high arched palate; proptosis; blue sclerae; 
dysmorphic  features  including  small  face  and  chin,  fronto-occipital 
prominence, pointed beaked nose, large cranium, and obtuse mandib-
ular angle; and small, square hands with hypoplastic nails. Radiographs 
demonstrate a generalized increase in bone density, but in contrast to 
osteopetrosis,  the  long  bones  are  normally  shaped.  Separated  cranial 
sutures,  including  the  persistent  patency  of  the  anterior  fontanel,  are 
characteristic  of  the  disorder.  There  may  also  be  hypoplasia  of  the 
sinuses, mandible, distal clavicles, and terminal phalanges. Persistence 
of deciduous teeth and sclerosis of the calvarium and base of the skull 
are  also  common.  Histologic  evaluation  shows  normal  cortical  bone 
architecture  with  decreased  osteoblastic  and  osteoclastic  activities. 
Serum  chemistries  are  normal,  and  unlike  osteopetrosis,  there  is  no 
anemia. There is no known treatment for this condition, and there are 
no reports of attempted bone marrow transplant.
 ■ PROGRESSIVE DIAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
Also  known  as  Camurati-Engelmann  disease,  progressive  diaphyseal 
dysplasia  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder  that  is  characterized 
radiographically by diaphyseal hyperostosis and a symmetric thickening 
and increased diameter of the endosteal and periosteal surfaces of the 
diaphyses of the long bones, particularly the femur and tibia, and, less 
often, the fibula, radius, and ulna. The genetic defect responsible for the 
disease has been localized to the area of chromosome 19q13.2 encoding 
tumor  growth  factor  (TGF)-β1.  The  mutation  promotes  activation  of 
TGF-β1.  The  clinical  severity  is  variable.  The  most  common  present-
ing  symptoms  are  pain  and  tenderness  of  the  involved  areas,  fatigue, 
muscle wasting, and gait disturbance. The weakness may be mistaken 
for muscular dystrophy. Characteristic body habitus includes thin limbs 
with  little  muscle  mass  yet  prominent  and  palpable  bones  and,  when 
the skull is involved, large head with prominent forehead and proptosis. 
Patients may also display signs of cranial nerve palsies, hydrocephalus, 
central hypogonadism, and Raynaud’s phenomenon. Radiographically, 
patchy  progressive  endosteal  and  periosteal  new  bone  formation  is 
observed  along  the  diaphyses  of  the  long  bones.  Bone  scintigraphy 
shows increased radiotracer uptake in involved areas.

Treatment  with  low-dose  glucocorticoids  relieves  bone  pain  and 
may  reverse  the  abnormal  bone  formation.  Intermittent  bisphos-
phonate therapy has produced clinical improvement in a limited num-
ber  of  patients.  Disease  activity  may  also  attenuate  as  patients  enter 
adulthood.
 ■ HYPEROSTOSIS CORTICALIS GENERALISATA
This is also known as van Buchem’s disease; it is an autosomal recessive 
disorder  characterized  by  endosteal  hyperostosis  in  which  osteo-
sclerosis  involves  the  skull,  mandible,  clavicles,  and  ribs.  The  major

3214 manifestations  are  due  to  narrowed  cranial  foramens  with  neural 
compressions  that  may  result  in  optic  atrophy,  facial  paralysis,  and 
deafness.  Adults  may  have  an  enlarged  mandible.  Serum  ALP  levels 
may  be  elevated,  which  reflect  the  uncoupled  bone  remodeling  with 
high  osteoblastic  formation  rates  and  low  osteoclastic  resorption.  As 
a  result,  there  is  increased  accumulation  of  normal  bone.  Endosteal 
hyperostosis with syndactyly, known as sclerosteosis, is a more severe 
form. The genetic defects for both sclerosteosis and van Buchem’s dis-
ease have been associated with mutations in the SOST gene.

 ■ MELORHEOSTOSIS
Melorheostosis (Greek, “flowing hyperostosis”) may occur sporadically 
or follow a pattern consistent with an autosomal recessive disorder. The 
major manifestation is progressive linear hyperostosis in one or more 
bones of one limb, usually a lower extremity. The name comes from the 
radiographic appearance of the involved bone, which resembles melted 
wax that has dripped down a candle. Symptoms appear during child-
hood as pain or stiffness in the area of sclerotic bone. There may be 
associated ectopic soft tissue masses, composed of cartilage or osseous 
tissue,  and  skin  changes  overlying  the  involved  bone,  consisting  of 
scleroderma-like areas and hypertrichosis. The disease does not prog-
ress in adults, but pain and stiffness may persist. Laboratory tests are 
unremarkable. Somatic mutations in MAP2K1, which increases MEK1 
activity downstream of the RAS pathway, and SMAD3, which upregu-
lates the TGF-β/SMAD pathway, have been identified in affected bone 
in patients with melorheostosis. There is no specific treatment. Surgical 
interventions to correct contractures are often unsuccessful.

 ■ OSTEOPOIKILOSIS
The  literal  translation  of  osteopoikilosis  is  “spotted  bones”;  it  is  a 
benign  autosomal  dominant  condition  in  which  numerous  small, 
variably shaped (usually round or oval) foci of bony sclerosis are seen 
in the epiphyses and adjacent metaphyses. The lesions may involve any 
bone except the skull, ribs, and vertebrae. They may be misidentified 
as  metastatic  lesions.  The  main  differentiating  points  are  that  bony 
lesions of osteopoikilosis are stable over time and do not accumulate 
radionucleotide on bone scanning. In some kindred, osteopoikilosis is 
associated with connective tissue nevi known as dermatofibrosis lentic-
ularis disseminata, also known as Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome. Most 
cases are caused by mutations in LEMD3, which is involved with bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Histologic inspection reveals 
thickened but otherwise normal trabeculae and islands of normal cor-
tical bone. No treatment is indicated.

 ■ HEPATITIS C–ASSOCIATED OSTEOSCLEROSIS
Hepatitis  C–associated  osteosclerosis  (HCAO)  is  a  rare  acquired  dif-
fuse  osteosclerosis  in  adults  with  prior  hepatitis  C  infection.  After  a 
latent  period  of  several  years,  patients  develop  diffuse  appendicular 
bone pain and a generalized increase in bone mass with elevated serum 
ALP.  Bone  biopsy  and  histomorphometry  reveal  increased  rates  of 
bone formation, decreased bone resorption with a marked decrease in 
osteoclasts, and dense lamellar bone. One patient had increased serum 
OPG  levels,  and  bone  biopsy  showed  large  numbers  of  osteoblasts 
positive  for  OPG  and  reduced  osteoclast  number.  Empirical  therapy 
includes pain control, and there may be beneficial response to bisphos-
phonate. Long-term antiviral therapy may reverse the bone disease.

DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH 
DEFECTIVE MINERALIZATION
 ■ HYPOPHOSPHATASIA
This is a rare inherited disorder that presents as rickets in infants and 
children or osteomalacia in adults with paradoxically low serum levels 
of  ALP.  The  frequency  of  the  severe  neonatal  and  infantile  forms  is 
about  1  in  100,000  live  births  in  Canada,  where  the  disease  is  most 
common because of its high prevalence among Mennonites and Hut-
terites. It is rare in African Americans. The severity of the disease is 
remarkably variable, ranging from intrauterine death associated with 
profound  skeletal  hypomineralization  at  one  extreme  to  premature 

tooth  loss  as  the  only  manifestation  in  some  adults.  Severe  cases  are 
inherited  in  an  autosomal  recessive  manner,  but  the  genetic  patterns 
are less clear for the milder forms. The disease is caused by a deficiency 
of  tissue  nonspecific  (bone/liver/kidney)  ALP  (TNSALP),  which, 
although ubiquitous, results only in bone abnormalities. Protein levels 
and  functions  of  the  other  ALP  isozymes  (germ  cell,  intestinal,  pla-
cental) are normal. Defective ALP permits accumulation of its major 
naturally occurring substrates including phosphoethanolamine (PEA), 
inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP). The 
accumulation of PPi interferes with mineralization through its action 
as a potent inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystal growth.

Perinatal  hypophosphatasia  becomes  manifest  during  pregnancy 
and  is  often  complicated  by  polyhydramnios  and  intrauterine  death. 
The  infantile  form  becomes  clinically  apparent  before  the  age  of  
6 months with failure to thrive, rachitic deformities, functional cranio-
synostosis despite widely open fontanels (which are actually hypomin-
eralized areas of the calvarium), raised intracranial pressure, and flail 
chest with predisposition to pneumonia. Hypercalcemia and hypercal-
ciuria are common. This form has a mortality rate of ~50%. Prognosis 
seems  to  improve  for  the  children  who  survive  infancy.  Childhood 
hypophosphatasia has variable clinical presentation. Premature loss of 
deciduous teeth (before age 5) is the hallmark of the disease. Rickets 
causes delayed walking with waddling gait, short stature, and dolicho-
cephalic skull with frontal bossing. The disease often improves during 
puberty but may recur in adult life. Adult hypophosphatasia presents 
during middle age with painful, poorly healing metatarsal stress frac-
tures or thigh pain due to femoral pseudofractures. Presentation may 
be subtle with muscle pain or recurring headaches as the predominant 
symptoms.  It  is  important  to  recognize  hypophosphatasia  in  adults 
because treatment with bisphosphonates can result in increased rather 
than decreased bone fragility.

Laboratory  investigation  reveals  low  ALP  levels  and  normal  or 
elevated levels of serum calcium and phosphorus despite clinical and 
radiologic  evidence  of  rickets  or  osteomalacia.  Serum  parathyroid 
hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels 
are  normal.  The  elevation  of  PLP  is  specific  for  the  disease  and  may 
even be present in asymptomatic parents of severely affected children. 
Because  vitamin  B6  increases  PLP  levels,  vitamin  B6  supplements 
should be discontinued 1 week before testing. Clinical testing is avail-
able to detect loss-of-function mutation(s) within the ALPL gene that 
encodes TNSALP.

In contrast to other forms of rickets and osteomalacia, calcium and 
vitamin D supplementation should be avoided because they may aggra-
vate hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. A low-calcium diet, glucocor-
ticoids, and calcitonin have been used in a small number of patients 
with variable responses. Because fracture healing is poor, placement of 
intramedullary rods is best for acute fracture repair and for prophylac-
tic prevention of fractures. In 2015, asfotase alfa, a tissue-nonspecific 
ALP was approved as enzyme replacement therapy for the perinatal/
infantile- and juvenile-onset forms. With 7 years of therapy, children 
with  perinatal/infantile  forms  showed  sustained  improvements  in 
mineralization,  along  with  improvements  in  other  features,  such  as 
respiratory function and growth.

 ■ AXIAL OSTEOMALACIA
This is a rare disorder characterized by defective skeletal mineralization 
despite normal serum calcium and phosphate levels. Clinically, the dis-
order presents in middle-aged or elderly men with chronic axial skeletal 
discomfort. Cervical spine pain may also be present. Radiographic find-
ings are mainly osteosclerosis due to coarsened trabecular patterns typi-
cal of osteomalacia. Spine, pelvis, and ribs are most commonly affected. 
Histologic  changes  show  defective  mineralization  and  flat,  inactive 
osteoblasts.  The  primary  defect  appears  to  be  an  acquired  defect  in 
osteoblast function. The course is benign, and there is no established 
treatment. Calcium and vitamin D therapies are not effective.

 ■ FIBROGENESIS IMPERFECTA OSSIUM
This is a rare condition of unknown etiology. It presents in both sexes; 
in middle age or later; and with progressive, intractable skeletal pain

and  fractures;  worsening  immobilization;  and  a  debilitating  course. 
The  only  biochemical  abnormality  is  elevated  ALP.  Radiographic 
evaluation  reveals  generalized  osteomalacia,  osteopenia,  and  occa-
sional  pseudofractures.  Histologic  features  include  a  tangled  pattern 
of  collagen  fibrils  with  abundant  osteoblasts  and  osteoclasts.  Use  of 
growth  hormone  led  to  substantial  short-term  clinical  improvement 
in two adult patients, but long-term outcomes are unknown. No other 
effective treatment is known. Spontaneous remission has been reported 
in a small number of patients.

FIBROUS DYSPLASIA AND MCCUNE-
ALBRIGHT SYNDROME
Fibrous dysplasia is a sporadic disorder characterized by the presence 
of one (monostotic) or more (polyostotic) expanding fibrous skeletal 
lesions  composed  of  bone-forming  mesenchyme.  The  association  of 
the  polyostotic  form  with  café  au  lait  spots  and  hyperfunction  of  an 
endocrine system such as pseudoprecocious puberty of ovarian origin 
is  known  as  McCune-Albright  syndrome  (MAS).  A  spectrum  of  the 
phenotypes  is  caused  by  activating  mutations  in  the  GNAS1  gene, 
which encodes the α subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsα). As the 
postzygotic mutations occur at different stages of early development, 
the extent and type of tissue affected are variable and explain the mosaic 
pattern of skin and bone changes. GTP binding activates the Gsα reg-
ulatory protein and mutations in regions of Gsα that selectively inhibit 
GTPase activity, which results in constitutive stimulation of the cyclic 
AMP–protein  kinase  A  signal  transduction  pathway.  Such  mutations 
of the Gsα protein–coupled receptor may cause autonomous function 
in bone (parathyroid hormone receptor); skin (melanocyte-stimulating 
hormone  receptor);  and  various  endocrine  glands  including  ovary 
(follicle-stimulating  hormone  receptor),  thyroid  (thyroid-stimulating 
hormone receptor), adrenal (adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor), 
and pituitary (growth hormone–releasing hormone receptor). The skel-
etal lesions are composed largely of mesenchymal cells that do not dif-
ferentiate into osteoblasts, resulting in the formation of imperfect bone. 
In some areas of bone, fibroblast-like cells develop features of osteoblasts 
in that they produce extracellular matrix that organizes into woven bone. 
Calcification may occur in some areas. In other areas, cells have features 
of chondrocytes and produce cartilage-like extracellular matrix.

Clinical  Presentation  Fibrous  dysplasia  occurs  with  equal  fre-
quency in both sexes, whereas MAS with precocious puberty is more 
common (10:1) in girls. The monostotic form is the most common and 
is usually diagnosed in patients between 20 and 30 years of age without 
associated  skin  lesions.  The  polyostotic  form  typically  manifests  in 
children <10 years old and may progress with age. Early-onset disease 
is  generally  more  severe.  Lesions  may  become  quiescent  in  puberty 
and progress during pregnancy or with estrogen therapy. In polyostotic 
fibrous dysplasia, the lesions most commonly involve the maxilla and 
other craniofacial bones, ribs, and metaphyseal or diaphyseal portions 
of the proximal femur or tibia. Expanding bone lesions may cause pain, 
deformity, fractures, and nerve entrapment. Sarcomatous degeneration 
involving  the  facial  bones  or  femur  is  infrequent  (<1%).  The  risk  of 
malignant transformation is increased by radiation, which has proven 
to  be  ineffective  treatment.  In  rare  patients  with  widespread  lesions, 
renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia may cause rickets or 
osteomalacia. Hypophosphatemia may be due to production of a phos-
phaturic factor by the abnormal fibrous tissue.

MAS patients may have café au lait spots, which are flat, hyperpig-
mented skin lesions that have rough borders (“coast of Maine”) in con-
trast to the café au lait lesions of neurofibromatosis that have smooth 
borders (“coast of California”). The most common endocrinopathy is 
isosexual pseudoprecocious puberty in girls. Other less common endo-
crine disorders include thyrotoxicosis, Cushing’s syndrome, acromeg-
aly,  hyperparathyroidism,  hyperprolactinemia,  and  pseudoprecocious 
puberty in boys.

Radiographic  Findings 
In  long  bones,  the  fibrous  dysplastic 
lesions  are  typically  well-defined,  radiolucent  areas  with  thin  corti-
ces  and  a  ground-glass  appearance.  Lesions  may  be  lobulated  with 

FIGURE 412-4  Radiograph of a 16-year-old male with fibrous dysplasia of the right 
proximal femur. Note the multiple cystic lesions, including the large lucent lesion 
in the proximal midshaft with scalloping of the interior surface. The femoral neck 
contains two lucent cystic lesions.

trabeculated areas of radiolucency (Fig. 412-4). Involvement of facial 
bones usually presents as radiodense lesions, which may create a leon-
ine appearance (leontiasis osea). Expansile cranial lesions may narrow 
foramens  and  cause  optic  lesions,  reduce  hearing,  and  create  other 
manifestations of cranial nerve compression.

Laboratory Results  Serum ALP is occasionally elevated, but calcium, 
parathyroid  hormone,  25-hydroxyvitamin  D,  and  1,25-dihydroxy- 
vitamin D levels are normal. Patients with extensive polyostotic lesions 
may  have  hypophosphatemia,  hyperphosphaturia,  and  osteomalacia. 
The  hypophosphatemia  and  phosphaturia  are  directly  related  to  the 
levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Biochemical markers of 
bone turnover may be elevated.

TREATMENT
Fibrous Dysplasia and MAS
Spontaneous  healing  of  the  lesions  does  not  occur,  and  there  is 
no established effective treatment. Improvement in bone pain and 
partial  or  complete  resolution  of  radiographic  lesions  have  been 
reported after IV bisphosphonate therapy. Denosumab given every 
3 months is effective in reducing bone turnover markers and could 
be  a  therapeutic  option  in  difficult  cases.  Surgical  stabilization  is 
used to prevent pathologic fracture or destruction of a major joint 
space  and  to  relieve  nerve  root  or  cranial  nerve  compression  or 
sinus obstruction.

OTHER DYSPLASIAS OF BONE  
AND CARTILAGE
 ■ PACHYDERMOPERIOSTOSIS
Pachydermoperiostosis,  or  hypertrophic  osteoarthropathy  (primary 
or  idiopathic),  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder  characterized  by 
periosteal new bone formation that involves the distal extremities. The 
lesions present as clubbing of the digits and hyperhidrosis and thicken-
ing of the skin, primarily of the face and forehead. The changes usually 
appear  during  adolescence,  progress  over  the  next  decade,  and  then 
become  quiescent.  During  the  active  phase,  progressive  enlargement

3216 of the hands and feet produces a paw-like appearance, which may be 
mistaken for acromegaly. Arthralgias, pseudogout, and limited mobil-
ity may also occur. The disorder must be differentiated from secondary 
hypertrophic  osteopathy  that  develops  during  the  course  of  serious 
pulmonary  disorders.  The  two  conditions  can  be  differentiated  by 
standard radiography of the digits in which secondary pachydermope-
riostosis has exuberant periosteal new bone formation and a smooth 
and undulating surface. In contrast, primary hypertrophic osteopathy 
has an irregular periosteal surface.

There are no diagnostic blood or urine tests. Synovial fluid does not 
have an inflammatory profile. There is no specific therapy, although a 
limited experience with colchicine suggests some benefit in controlling 
the arthralgias.

 ■ OSTEOCHONDRODYSPLASIAS
These include several hundred heritable disorders of connective tissue. 
These  primary  abnormalities  of  cartilage  manifest  as  disturbances  in 
cartilage and bone growth. Selected growth-plate chondrodysplasias are 
described here. For discussion of chondrodysplasias, see Chap. 413.

Achondrodysplasia  This  is  a  relatively  common  form  of  short-
limb dwarfism that occurs in 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 40,000 live births. The 
disease is caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 
3 (FGFR3) gene that results in a gain-of-function state. Most cases are 
sporadic mutations. However, when the disorder appears in families, 
the  inheritance  pattern  is  consistent  with  an  autosomal  dominant 
disorder. The primary defect is abnormal chondrocyte proliferation at 
the growth plate that causes development of short, but proportionately 
thick,  long  bones.  Other  regions  of  the  long  bones  may  be  relatively 
unaffected.  The  disorder  is  manifest  by  the  presence  of  short  limbs 
(particularly the proximal portions), normal trunk, large head, saddle 
nose, and an exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Severe spinal deformity may 
lead to  cord  compression.  The homozygous disorder is more serious 
than the sporadic form and may cause neonatal death. Vosoritide, an 
analog of C-type natriuretic peptide, increased growth among children 
in  phase  3  clinical  trials.  Treatment  is  controversial  among  patient 
support communities. Infigratinib, a selective FGFR1-3 tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor, is in phase 2 clinical trials. Pseudoachondroplasia clinically 
resembles achondrodysplasia but has no skull abnormalities.

Enchondromatosis  This is also called dyschondroplasia or Ollier’s 
disease; it is also a disorder of the growth plate in which the primary 
cartilage is not resorbed. Cartilage ossification proceeds normally, but 
it  is  not  resorbed  normally,  leading  to  cartilage  accumulation.  The 
changes are most marked at the ends of long bones, where the highest 
growth rates occur. Chondrosarcoma develops infrequently. The asso-
ciation of enchondromatosis and cavernous hemangiomas of the skin 
and soft tissues is known as Maffucci’s syndrome. Both Ollier’s disease 
and  Maffucci’s  syndrome  are  associated  with  various  malignancies, 
including granulosa cell tumor of the ovary and cerebral glioma.

Multiple Osteochondromas  This is also called multiple exostoses 
or diaphyseal aclasis; it is a genetic disorder that follows an autosomal 
dominant  pattern  of  inheritance.  In  this  condition,  areas  of  growth 
plates become displaced, presumably by growing through a defect in 
the  perichondrium.  The  lesion  begins  with  vascular  invasion  of  the 
growth-plate cartilage, resulting in a characteristic radiographic find-
ing of a mass that is in direct communication with the marrow cavity 
of the parent bone. The underlying cortex is resorbed. The disease is 
caused by inactivating mutations of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes, whose 
products  normally  synthesize  heparan  sulfate  chains.  The  resulting 
heparan  sulfate  deficiency  impacts  signaling  pathways  and  leads  to 
ectopic chondrogenesis. Solitary or multiple lesions are located in the 
metaphyses of long bones. Although usually asymptomatic, the lesions 
may  interfere  with  joint  or  tendon  function  or  compress  peripheral 
nerves.  The  lesions  stop  growing  when  growth  ceases  but  may  recur 
during pregnancy. There is a small risk for malignant transformation 
into chondrosarcoma. Palovarotene, a retinoic acid receptor agonist, is 
in clinical trials.

EXTRASKELETAL (ECTOPIC) 
CALCIFICATION AND OSSIFICATION
Deposition of calcium phosphate crystals (calcification) or formation 
of true bone (ossification) in nonosseous soft tissue may occur by one 
of three mechanisms: (1) metastatic calcification due to a supranormal 
calcium × phosphate concentration product in extracellular fluid; (2) 
dystrophic  calcification  due  to  mineral  deposition  into  metabolically 
impaired  or  dead  tissue  despite  normal  serum  levels  of  calcium  and 
phosphate; and (3) ectopic ossification, or true bone formation. Disor-
ders that may cause extraskeletal calcification or ossification are listed 
in Table 412-2.
 ■ METASTATIC CALCIFICATION
Soft  tissue  calcification  may  complicate  diseases  associated  with  sig-
nificant  hypercalcemia,  hyperphosphatemia,  or  both.  In  addition, 
vitamin D and phosphate treatments or calcium administration in the 
presence  of  mild  hyperphosphatemia,  such  as  during  hemodialysis, 
may  induce  ectopic  calcification.  Calcium  phosphate  precipitation 
may  complicate  any  disorder  when  the  serum  calcium  ×  phosphate 
concentration product is >75. The initial calcium phosphate deposition 
is in the form of small, poorly organized crystals, which subsequently 
organize  into  hydroxyapatite  crystals.  Calcifications  that  occur  in 
hypercalcemic states with normal or low phosphate have a predilection 
for kidney, lungs, and gastric mucosa. Hyperphosphatemia with nor-
mal or low serum calcium may promote soft tissue calcification with 
predilection for the kidney and arteries. The disturbances of calcium 
and phosphate in renal failure and hemodialysis are common causes of 
soft tissue (metastatic) calcification.
 ■ TUMORAL CALCINOSIS
This  is  a  rare  genetic  disorder  characterized  by  masses  of  metastatic 
calcifications in soft tissues around major joints, most often shoulders, 
hips, and ankles. Tumoral calcinosis differs from other disorders in that 
the periarticular masses contain hydroxyapatite crystals or amorphous 
calcium phosphate complexes, whereas in fibrodysplasia ossificans pro-
gressiva (below), true bone is formed in soft tissues. About one-third of 
tumoral calcinosis cases are familial, with both autosomal recessive and 
autosomal dominant modes of inheritance reported. The disease is also 
associated with a variably expressed abnormality of dentition marked 
by short bulbous roots, pulp calcification, and radicular dentin depos-
ited in swirls. The disorder is caused by gene mutations in GALNT3, 
FGF23,  or  α-Klotho,  leading  to  FGF23  deficiency  or  resistance.  The 
reduced activity of FGF23 leads to increased renal tubular reabsorption 
of phosphate, elevated serum phosphate, and spontaneous soft tissue 
calcification from elevated calcium-phosphate concentration product.
The disease usually presents in childhood and continues throughout 
the patient’s life. The calcific masses are typically painless and grow at 
variable rates, sometimes becoming large and bulky. The masses are often

located near major joints but remain extracapsular. Joint range of motion 
is not usually restricted unless the tumors are very large. Complications 
include compression of neural structures and ulceration of the overlying 
skin with drainage of chalky fluid and risk of secondary infection. Small 
deposits not detected by standard radiographs may be detected by 99mTc 
bone scanning. The most common laboratory findings are hyperphos-
phatemia  and  elevated  serum  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D  levels.  Serum 
calcium, parathyroid hormone, and ALP levels are usually normal. Renal 
function is also usually normal. Urine calcium and phosphate excretions 
are low, and calcium and phosphate balances are positive.

An  acquired  form  of  the  disease  may  occur  with  other  causes  of 
hyperphosphatemia,  such  as  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  asso-
ciated  with  hemodialysis,  hypoparathyroidism,  pseudohypoparathy-
roidism, and massive cell lysis following chemotherapy for leukemia. 
Tissue trauma from joint movement may contribute to the periartic-
ular calcifications. Metastatic calcifications are also seen in conditions 
associated with hypercalcemia, such as in sarcoidosis, vitamin D intox-
ication,  milk-alkali  syndrome,  and  primary  hyperparathyroidism.  In 
these conditions, however, mineral deposits are more likely to occur in 
proton-transporting organs such as kidney, lungs, and gastric mucosa 
in which an alkaline milieu is generated by the proton pumps.

TREATMENT
Tumoral Calcinosis

Therapeutic successes have been achieved with surgical removal of 
subcutaneous calcified masses, which tend not to recur if all calci-
fication  is  removed  from  the  site.  Reduction  of  serum  phosphate 
by  chronic  phosphorus  restriction  may  be  accomplished  using 
low  dietary  phosphorus  intake  alone  or  in  combination  with  oral 
phosphate binders. The addition of the phosphaturic agent acetazo-
lamide may be useful. Limited experience using the phosphaturic 
action of calcitonin deserves further testing.

 ■ DYSTROPHIC CALCIFICATION
Posttraumatic  calcification  may  occur  with  normal  serum  calcium 
and  phosphate  levels  and  normal  ion-solubility  product.  The  depos-
ited  mineral  is  either  in  the  form  of  amorphous  calcium  phosphate 
or  hydroxyapatite  crystals.  Soft  tissue  calcification  complicating  con-
nective  tissue  disorders  such  as  scleroderma,  dermatomyositis,  and 
systemic lupus erythematosus may involve localized areas of the skin 
or deeper subcutaneous tissue and is referred to as calcinosis circum-
scripta.  Mineral  deposition  at  sites  of  deeper  tissue  injury  including 
periarticular sites is called calcinosis universalis.
 ■ ECTOPIC OSSIFICATION
True  extraskeletal  bone  formation  that  begins  in  areas  of  fasciitis 
following  surgery,  trauma,  burns,  or  neurologic  injury  is  referred  to 
as  myositis  ossificans.  The  bone  formed  is  organized  as  lamellar  or 
trabecular, with normal osteoblasts and osteoclasts conducting active 
remodeling. Well-developed haversian systems and marrow elements 
may be present. A second cause of ectopic bone formation occurs in an 
inherited disorder, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.
 ■ FIBRODYSPLASIA OSSIFICANS PROGRESSIVA
This  is  also  called  myositis  ossificans  progressiva;  it  is  a  rare  autosomal 
dominant disorder characterized by congenital deformities of the hands 
and feet and episodic soft tissue swellings that ossify. The disorder is 
caused  by  an  activating  mutation  in  activin  receptor  A  type  1.  Ectopic 
bone  formation  occurs  in  fascia,  tendons,  ligaments,  and  connective 
tissue  within  voluntary  muscles.  Tender,  rubbery  induration,  some-
times precipitated by trauma, develops in the soft tissue and gradually 
calcifies. Eventually, heterotopic bone forms at these sites of soft tissue 
trauma. Morbidity results from heterotopic bone interfering with nor-
mal movement and function of muscle and other soft tissues. Mortality 
is usually related to restrictive lung disease caused by an inability of the 
chest to expand. Laboratory tests are unremarkable.

There  is  no  effective  medical  therapy.  Bisphosphonates,  glucocor-
ticoids, and a low-calcium diet have largely been ineffective in halting 

progression  of  the  ossification.  Palovarotene  and  REGN2477  (also 
known  as  garetosmab),  an  anti–activin  A  antibody,  are  currently  in 
clinical trials. Surgical removal of ectopic bone is not recommended, 
because the trauma of surgery may precipitate formation of new areas 
of heterotopic bone. Dental complications, including frozen jaw, may 
occur following injection of local anesthetics.

413 Heritable Disorders of 
Connective Tissue
Joan C. Marini, Fransiska Malfait

CLASSIFICATION OF CONNECTIVE  
TISSUE DISORDERS
Some of the most common conditions that are transmitted genetically 
in  families  are  disorders  that  produce  clinically  obvious  changes  in 
the bone, cartilage, skin, or relatively acellular tissues such as tendons 
that have been loosely defined as connective tissues. Because of their 
heritability,  some  of  the  disorders  were  recognized  as  potentially 
traceable to mutated genes soon after the principles of genetics were 
introduced into medicine by Garrod and others. About half a century 
later,  McKusick  emphasized  the  specificity  of  many  of  the  diseases 
for selective connective tissues and suggested that they were probably 
caused by mutations in genes coding for the major proteins found in 
those tissues. In the past several decades, mutations in several hundred 
different genes expressed in connective tissues have been identified as 
the  cause  of  many  connective  tissue  disorders.  However,  classifying 
the disorders on the basis of either their clinical presentations or the 
mutations causing them continues to present a challenge for both the 
clinician and the molecular biologist.

Information  on  the  disorders  has  continued  to  develop  on  two 
levels.  The  initial  clinical  classifications  suggested  by  McKusick  and

3218 many  others  had  to  be  refined  as  more  patients  were  examined.  For 
example, some patients had skin changes similar to those commonly 
seen in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), but this feature was overshad-
owed by other features such as extreme hypotonia or sudden rupture 
of large blood vessels. To account for the full spectrum of presentations 
in patients and families, many of the disorders have been reclassified 
several times, dividing each into a series of subtypes.

The identification of mutations causing the diseases has developed 
on a parallel track. The first genes cloned for connective tissues were 
the  two  genes  coding  for  type  I  collagen  (COL1A1  and  COL1A2), 
the most abundant protein in bones, skin, tendons, and several other 
tissues.  This  facilitated  early  studies  in  patients  with  osteogenesis 
imperfecta (OI) that revealed mutations in type I collagen genes. Bio-
chemical  data,  developed  primarily  with  cultures  of  skin  fibroblasts 
from  affected  individuals,  demonstrated  that  the  mutations  dramat-
ically  altered  the  synthesis  of  collagen  α-chains  or  the  structure  of 
collagen  fibers.  The  results  stimulated  efforts  to  identify  additional 
mutations in genes coding for structural proteins. Genes for collagens 
provided an attractive paradigm to search for mutations, since a series 
of different types of collagens were found in different connective tissues 
and the collagen genes were readily isolated by their unique signature 
sequences. Also, the collagen genes were vulnerable to a large number 
of  different  mutations  because  of  unusual  structural  requirements  of 
the protein. The search for mutations in collagen genes proved fruit-
ful  in  that  mutations  were  found  in  most  patients  with  OI,  in  many 
patients  with  hyperextensible  skin  and  hypermobile  joints,  in  some 
patients with dwarfism, and in patients with other disorders, including 
some  such  as  Alport  syndrome  (AS)  that  were  not  initially  classified 
as  disorders  of  connective  tissue.  Also,  mutations  in  collagen  genes 
were  found  in  subset  of  patients  presenting  with  osteoarthritis  (OA) 
or osteoporosis, likely representing the mildest end of the syndromic 
spectrum. However, the search for mutations quickly expanded to hun-
dreds of other genes that included genes for other structural proteins, 
for the posttranslational modification and processing of the structural 
proteins, for chaperones, and for growth factors and their receptors and 
other genes whose functions are still not fully understood.

In many instances, the mutations helped to define the clinical subtype 
of the disorder, while in others, they revealed the genetic heterogeneity 
of the same clinical presentations. Conversely, some patients with dif-
ferent manifestations were found to have mutations in the same genes. 
In noncollagenous genes, it was sometimes difficult to establish whether 
a change in the structure of a gene caused the phenotypic changes in 
the  patients  or  was  simply  a  neutral  polymorphism.  Therefore,  there 
has  been  a  continuing  debate  as  to  whether  the  disorders  should  be 
classified by their clinical presentations or by the causative genes. As an 
illustration  of  the  problems,  mutations  in  437  genes  have  been  found 
associated  with  the  461  defined  disorders  of  the  skeleton.  The  latest 
nosology for the disorders remains “hybrid” in nature in the sense that 
the classification is not always based on the same criteria. Some diseases 
are grouped based on the causal gene, others are listed together, because 
they share common radiographic features, and still others are brought 
together because of a similar clinical course (lethality) or involvement 
of similar parts of the skeleton. A simpler system of classification proved 
feasible  for  one  rare  heritable  disorder  of  skin,  epidermolysis  bullosa. 
The  disorder  was  first  defined  clinically  into  subtypes  based  on  the 
layers  of  the  skin  that  were  cleaved  in  friction-induced  blisters.  Most 
patients  in  each  subtype  were  subsequently  shown  to  have  mutations 
in genes expressed in the corresponding layer of skin. Even with these 
patients, the strength of the genotype-phenotype correlation varies and 
mutations have not yet been found in every patient.

The best pathway through this maze of information is probably to 
begin by matching the signs and symptoms in a patient with the presen-
tations that define each clinical classification. A major focus should be 
on the most common disorders, recognizing that the signs and symp-
toms may vary among different individuals and family members with 
the same diagnosis. Then, attempt to reach a decision, in consultation 
with the patient, parents, and specialist, as to whether a DNA analysis 
for the probable mutation is indicated. Among the considerations are 
the cost, the rigor with which the clinical classification has been linked 

to  mutated  genes,  the  reassurance  the  diagnosis  can  bring  to  patients 
and their families, the use of the information for prenatal diagnosis, and 
the possibility that mutation-specific therapies may be developed in the 
future. For patients with the most severe forms, it is probably best to 
consult a specialist in the disease to determine a multidisciplinary pro-
gram for management and therapy. Patient support groups have formed 
for many of the diseases and are an important source of information.

Patients with the most common forms of the disorders have muta-
tions in a limited number of genes. This chapter will focus primarily 
on  these.  Also,  it  will  provide  a  brief  summary  of  biosynthesis  and 
structure of connective tissues that may help guide the physician from 
the nature of the mutations to their clinical presentations.

 ■ COMPOSITION OF CONNECTIVE TISSUES
Connective  tissues  such  as  skin,  bone,  cartilage,  ligaments,  and  ten-
dons are the critical structural frameworks of the body. They consist 
of  a  complex  interacting  extracellular  matrix  network  of  collagens, 
proteoglycans,  and  a  large  number  of  noncollagenous  glycoproteins 
and proteins. While these precise combinations of up to ~500 poten-
tial extracellular matrix building blocks provide tissue-specific func-
tion, there are many overarching similarities in composition such as 
the role of composite collagen fibrils in providing strength and form, 
elastin  fibrils  and  proteoglycans  and  other  interacting  proteins,  and 
glycoproteins that fine-tune function (Table 413-1). The most abun-
dant components of many connective tissues are three similar fibrillar 
collagens (types I, II, and III). They have a similar tensile strength that 
is  comparable  to  that  of  steel  wires.  The  three  fibrillar  collagens  are 
distributed  in  a  tissue-specific  manner:  type  I  collagen  accounts  for 
most of the protein of dermis, ligaments, tendons, and demineralized 
bone; type I and type III are the most abundant proteins of large blood 
vessels; and type II is the most abundant protein of cartilage.

 ■ BIOSYNTHESIS AND TURNOVER OF  
CONNECTIVE TISSUES
Connective  tissues  are  among  the  most  stable  components  in  living 
organisms,  but  they  are  not  inert.  During  embryonic  development, 
connective tissue membranes appear as early as the four-cell blastocyst 
to  provide  a  structural  scaffold  for  the  developing  embryo.  With  the 
development  of  blood  vessels  and  skeleton,  there  is  a  rapid  increase 
in  the  synthesis,  degradation,  and  resynthesis  of  connective  tissues. 
The  turnover  continues  at  a  slower,  but  still  rapid  pace  throughout 
postnatal  development  and  then  spikes  during  the  growth  spurt  of 
puberty. During adulthood, the metabolic turnover of most connective 
tissues is slow, but it continues at a moderate pace in bone. With age, 
malnutrition, physical inactivity, and low gravitational stress, the rate 
of degradation of most connective tissues, especially in bone and skin, 
begins to exceed the rate of synthesis and the tissues shrink. In starva-
tion, a large fraction of the collagen in skin and other connective tissues 
is degraded and provides amino acids for gluconeogenesis (Chap. 334). 
In both OA and rheumatoid arthritis, there is extensive degradation of 
articular  cartilage  collagen.  Glucocorticoids  weaken  most  tissues  by 
decreasing collagen synthesis. In some pathologic states, however, col-
lagen is deposited in excess. With most injuries to tissues, inflamma-
tory and immune responses stimulate the deposition of collagen fibrils 
in the form of fibrotic scars. In humans, as distinct from many other 
species, the deposition of the fibrils is largely irreversible and prevents 
regeneration  of  normal  tissues  in  diseases  such  as  hepatic  cirrhosis, 
pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and nephrosclerosis.

Structure and Biosynthesis of Fibrillar Collagens  The tensile 
strength of collagen fibers derives primarily from the self-assembly of 
protein monomers into large fibril structures in a process that resem-
bles  crystallization.  The  self-assembly  requires  monomers  of  highly 
uniform and relatively rigid structure. It also requires a complex series 
of posttranslational processing steps that maintain the solubility of the 
monomers until they are transported to the appropriate extracellular 
sites for fibril assembly. Because of the stringent requirements for cor-
rect self-assembly, it is not surprising that mutations in genes for fibril-
lar collagens cause many of the heritable diseases of connective tissues.

FIGURE 413-1  Schematic summary of biosynthesis of fibrillar collagens. (Reproduced with permission from J Myllyharju, KI Kivirikko: Collagens, modifying enzymes and 
their mutations in humans, flies and worms. Trends Genet 20:33, 2004.)

The monomers of the three fibrillar collagens are formed from three 
polypeptide chains, called α chains, that are wrapped around each other 
into a rope-like triple-helical conformation. The triple helix is a unique 
structure among proteins, and it provides rigidity to the molecule. It 
also orients the side chains of amino acids in an “inside out” manner 
relative  to  most  other  proteins  so  that  the  charged  and  hydrophobic 
residues on the surface can direct self-assembly of the monomers into 
fibrils.  The  triple-helical  conformation  of  the  monomer  is  generated 
because each of the α chains has a repetitive amino acid sequence in 
which glycine (Gly) appears as every third amino acid. Each α chain 
contains ~1000 amino acids. Therefore, the sequence of each α chain 
can  be  designated  as  (-Gly-X-Y-)n,  where  X  and  Y  represent  amino 
acids  other  than  glycine  and  n  is  >338.  The  presence  of  glycine,  the 
smallest amino acid, in every third position in the sequence is critical 
because  this  residue  must  fit  into  a  sterically  restricted  space  in 
the  interior  of  the  helix  where  the  three  chains  come  together.  The 
requirement  for  a  glycine  residue  at  every  third  position  explains 
the  significant  clinical  effects  of  mutations  that  convert  a  glycine 
residue to an amino acid with a bulkier side chain (see below). Many 
of the X- and Y-position amino acids are proline and hydroxyproline, 
which, because of their ring structures, provide additional rigidity to 
the triple helix. Other X- and Y-positions are occupied by charged or 
hydrophobic amino acids that precisely direct lateral and longitudinal 
assembly of the monomers into highly ordered fibrils. Mutations that 
substitute amino acids in some X- and Y-positions, particularly argin-
ine-to-cysteine substitutions, can also produce genetic diseases.

The fibers formed by the three fibrillar collagens differ in thickness 
and length, but they have a similar fine structure. As viewed by electron 
microscopy,  they  all  have  a  characteristic  pattern  of  cross-striations 
that  are  about  one-quarter  the  length  of  the  monomers  and  reflect 
the precise packing into fibrils. The three fibrillar collagens, however, 
differ  in  sequences  found  in  the  X-  and  Y-positions  of  the  α  chains 
and therefore in some of their physical properties. Type I collagen is a 
heterotrimer, composed of two identical α1(I) chains and a third α2(I) 
chain that differs slightly in its amino acid sequence. Types II and III 
collagen are homotrimers, each composed of three identical α chains 
distinct to that type of collagen.

To  deliver  a  monomer  of  the  correct  structure  to  the  appropriate 
site of fibril assembly, the biosynthesis of fibrillar collagens involves a 
large number of unique processing steps (Fig. 413-1). The monomer, 
first  synthesized  as  a  soluble  precursor  called  procollagen,  contains 
an additional globular domain at each end. As the pre-proα chains of 
procollagen  are  synthesized  on  ribosomes,  the  free  N-terminal  ends 
move  into  the  cisternae  of  the  rough  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER). 
Signal peptides at the N-termini are cleaved, and additional posttrans-
lational  reactions  begin.  Proline  and  lysine  residues  in  the  Y-position 
of  the  Gly-X-Y  repeating  triplet  are  hydroxylated  along  the  length 
of  the  helix  by  the  enzymes  prolyl  4-hydroxylase  (P4H1)  and  lysyl 
hydroxylase (LH1). respectively. Hydroxyproline residues are essen-
tial for the three α chains of the monomer to fold into a triple helix at 
body temperature. P4H1 requires ascorbic acid as an essential cofac-
tor,  an  observation  that  explains  why  wounds  fail  to  heal  in  scurvy 
(Chap. 333). In scurvy, some of the underhydroxylated and unfolded 
protein accumulates in the cisternae of the rough ER and is degraded. 
Many hydroxylysine residues are glycosylated with galactose or with 
galactose  and  glucose.  Also,  a  large  mannose-rich  oligosaccharide  is 
assembled on the C-terminal propeptide of each chain. The proα chains 
are assembled by interactions among these C-terminal propeptides that 
control the selection of the appropriate partner chains to form hetero- 
or homotrimers and provide the correct chain registration required for 
subsequent formation of the collagen triple helix. After the C-terminal 
propeptides  assemble  the  three  proα  chains,  a  nucleus  of  triple  helix 
is formed near the C-terminus, and the helical conformation is prop-
agated toward the N-terminus in a zipper-like manner that resembles 
crystallization. The folding into the triple helix is spontaneous in solu-
tion,  but  as  discussed  below,  identification  of  rare  mutations  causing 
OI demonstrated that the folding in cellulo is assisted by a number of 
ancillary  proteins  that  also  prevent  collagen  fibril  formation  within 
the  ER.  The  fully  folded  procollagen  is  then  transported  to  the  Golgi 
via a specific COPII vesicle process. After further modifications in the 
Golgi stack, the procollagen is secreted into the pericellular space where 
distinct proteases remove the N- and C-propeptides at specific cleavage 
sites. The release of the propeptides decreases the solubility of the result-
ing collagen ~1000-fold. The entropic energy that is released drives the

self-assembly of the collagen into fibrils. Self-assembled collagen fibers 
have considerable tensile strength, but their strength is increased further 
by cross-linking reactions that form covalent bonds between α chains in 
one molecule and α chains in adjacent molecules. The resulting fibers, 
comprised of hundreds or thousands of triple-helical monomers, have 
some of the properties of a crystal but have innate imperfections that 
make them highly flexible.

Although the assembly of collagen monomers into fibers is largely a 
spontaneous reaction, the process in tissues is modulated by the pres-
ence of less abundant collagens (type V with type I, and type XI with 
type II) and by other components such as a series of small leucine-rich 
proteins (SLRPs). Some of the less abundant components alter the rate 
of fibril assembly, whereas others change the morphology of the fibers 
or  their  interactions  with  cells  and  other  molecules.  The  presence  of 
these other components is one explanation for why, in some tissues, the 
fibers are further assembled into large tendons; in others, into sheets; 
and in still others, into complex structures such as the hexagonal array 
of fibers that provide both the strength and transparency of the cornea.
Collagen fibers are resistant to most proteases, but during degrada-
tion  of  connective  tissues,  they  are  cleaved  by  specific  matrix  metal-
loproteinases  (collagenases)  that  cause  partial  unfolding  of  the  triple 
helices  into  gelatin-like  structures  that  are  further  degraded  by  less 
specific proteinases.

 ■ OTHER COLLAGENS AND RELATED MOLECULES
The  unique  properties  of  the  triple  helix  are  used  to  define  a  family 
of  at  least  28  collagens  that  contain  repetitive  -Gly-X-Y-  sequences 
and form triple helices of varying length and complexity. The proteins 
are  heterogeneous  both  in  structure  and  function,  and  many  are  the 
sites of mutations causing genetic diseases. For example, the type IV 
collagen found in basement membranes is composed of three α chains 
synthesized from any of six different genes; mutations in the COL4A3, 
COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes cause AS.

Fibrillin Aggregates and Elastin 
In addition to tensile strength, 
many  tissues  such  as  the  lung,  large  blood  vessels,  and  ligaments 
require  elasticity.  The  elasticity  was  originally  ascribed  to  an  amor-
phous rubber-like protein named elastin. Subsequent analyses, largely 
sparked  by  discoveries  of  mutations  causing  the  Marfan  syndrome 
(MFS),  demonstrated  that  the  elasticity  resided  in  thin  fibrils  com-
posed primarily of large glycoproteins named fibrillins. The fibrillins 
contain large numbers of epidermal growth factor–like domains inter-
spersed with characteristic cysteine-rich domains that are also found 
in  latent  transforming  growth  factor  β  (TGF-β)  binding  proteins. 
The  fibrillins  assemble  into  long  beadlike  strands  that  also  contain 
numerous other components including small and variable amounts of 
elastin, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), and microfibril-associated 
glycoproteins  (MAGPs).  Besides  contributing  to  extracellular  matrix 
structure, a major role for fibrillins in TGF-β signaling was emphasized 
by the discovery of mutations in genes coding for proteins involved in 
canonical TGF-β signaling in patients with Marfan-like manifestations, 
including thoracic aortic aneurysm.

Proteoglycans  The resiliency to compression of connective tissues 
such  as  cartilage  or  the  aorta  is  largely  explained  by  the  presence  of 
proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are composed of a core protein to which 
are attached a large series of negatively charged polymers of disaccha-
rides (largely chondroitin sulfates). At least 30 proteoglycans have been 
identified. They vary in their binding to collagens and other compo-
nents of matrix, but specific functions have not been assigned to most. 
The major proteoglycan of cartilage, called aggrecan, has a core protein 
of 2000 amino acids that is decorated with ~100 side chains of chon-
droitin sulfate and keratin sulfate. The core protein, in turn, binds to 
long chains of the polymeric disaccharide hyaluronan to form proteo-
glycan aggregates, one of the largest soluble macromolecular structures 
in nature. Because of its highly negative charge and extended structure, 
the proteoglycan aggregate binds large amounts of water and small ions 
to distend the three-dimensional arcade of collagen fibers found in the 
same tissues. It thereby makes the cartilage resilient to pressure.

SPECIFIC DISORDERS
 ■ OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA
OI  is  a  phenotypically  and  genetically  heterogeneous  generalized 
connective tissue disorder. The hallmark features of OI are increased 
susceptibility  to  skeletal  fractures,  bone  deformity,  and  growth  defi-
ciency. Bone fragility is based on decreased bone mass and increased 
bone  brittleness  due  to  defective  mineralization.  Secondary  features 
of OI are highly variable even within a type and include blue sclerae, 
dentinogenesis  imperfecta,  hearing  loss,  basilar  invagination,  pulmo-
nary function impairment, cardiac valve abnormalities, and ligamen-
tous laxity. Most patients have defects in the structure or quantity of 
type I collagen.

Classification  OI was originally classified into congenita and tarda 
subtypes  depending  on  the  age  of  symptom  onset.  Sillence  proposed 
the classification that bears his name for four types based on clinical 
and  radiologic  findings  and  mode  of  inheritance.  The  extension  of 
the Sillence classification was first based on distinctive bone histology 
(types V and VI OI) and subsequently on the discovery of new reces-
sive  genes  (types  VII–XVIII).  The  debate  between  classification  by 
phenotypic severity or gene defects has resulted in clinical and genetic 
classifications. The clinical classification can be useful for management 
but  results  in  different  type  assignments  in  the  same  family  or  even 
in  the  same  individual  over  their  lifetime.  The  genetic  classification 
(Table  413-2)  groups  patients  by  the  causative  gene.  Because  related 
causative genes were discovered close in time to each other, the genetic 
classification further groups types by overall mechanism and features 
OI as a collagen-related disorder.

Types I–IV OI are due to quantitative or structural defects in type I 
collagen  itself.  Type  I  is  the  mildest  subtype,  with  reduced  quantity 
of structurally normal collagen, and can produce mild or inapparent 
skeletal  deformities.  Most  patients  have  distinctly  blue  sclerae.  Types 
II, III, and IV are all caused by structural defects in one of the type I 
collagen α chains. Type II produces bone so brittle that infants have in 
utero fractures of ribs and long bones and die in the perinatal period. 
Type  III  is  progressively  deforming  with  moderate  to  severe  bone 
deformity, and type IV has mild to moderate bone fragility and second-
ary features. Subsequent rare recessive OI types are all collagen-related. 
Types  V  and  VI  (ITITM5  and  SERPINF1)  particularly  compromise 
matrix  mineralization.  Types  VII,  VIII,  and  IX  (CRTAP,  P3H1,  and 
PPIB)  represent  defects  in  the  components  of  the  procollagen  prolyl 
3-hydroxylation  complex  that  modifies  collagen  posttranslationally. 
Types  X–XII  (SERPINH1,  FKBP10,  and  BMP1)  have  compromised 
procollagen processing and cross-linking. The final grouping of types 
XIII–XVIII (SP7, TMEM38B, WNT1, CREBL1, SPARC, and MBTPS2) 
alter osteoblast differentiation and impair collagen matrix quality.

The clinical heterogeneity of affected individuals within a particu-
lar OI type and even with the same mutation is not understood, with 
unknown modifying factors presumably involved. Among adults with 
OI,  women  are  prone  to  fracture  during  pregnancy  and  after  meno-
pause.  Some  variants  of  mild  OI  are  first  detected  perimenopausally 
and must be distinguished from postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Incidence 
In North America and Europe, the estimated incidence 
of OI is 1 per 10,000–15,000 births, based on a combination of cases 
recognized at birth and population surveys for milder cases. In popu-
lations with a high level of consanguinity or a founder mutation, the 
incidence of the rare recessive forms of OI is a significant addition to 
the prevalence of dominant collagen defects.

Effects  on  Tissue  Systems  The  phenotypic  features  of  OI  are 
highly  variable,  even  within  the  types  caused  by  defects  in  type  I 
collagen. The following section generally focuses on dominant forms 
comprising the majority of cases, except as specified, but the descrip-
tions can be generalized to a large extent.

Musculoskeletal Effects  Bone in OI is both weak and brittle. At 
the mildest end of the spectrum (type I OI), individuals may have only 
several  childhood  fractures  and  be  limited  only  from  contact  sports.

More  severe  forms  of  OI  require  bone  to  be  partially  unloaded  with 
assistive  devices  such  as  walkers  or  canes;  many  severe  patients  use 
electric  chairs  for  both  the  weight  bearing  and  the  normal  speed  of 
mobility.  In  dominant  OI,  fragility  fractures  often  decrease  sharply 
after adequate bone mass is gained at puberty. Radiographs generally 
show  osteopenia  in  all  types,  with  disordered  matrix  organization 
detected most easily in lower long bones in moderate and severe forms. 
In lethal OI, radiographs show continuous beading of ribs from healing 
fractures and crumpled and undertubulated long bones. Lateral skull 
radiographs may show islands of Wormian bones, even in mild forms. 
The appearance of “popcorn” at the metaphyses of long bones occurs 
in many type III and IV children and coincides with increased growth 
deficiency. Often these bones are so soft that normal muscle pull can 
produce severe deformities. Kyphoscoliosis is associated with vertebral 
compressions  but  is  not  prevented  by  bisphosphonates,  suggesting  a 
contribution from ligamentous laxity.

OI bone is weak, in that it fractures with a lower load than normal, 
and  brittle,  in  that  it  does  not  tolerate  postyield  displacement  and 
snaps like chalk. The brittleness results from the paradoxical increased 
mineralization  of  OI  bone.  While  dual-energy  x-ray  absorptiometry 
(DXA) bone density measurements uniformly return a reduced value 
for OI bone, it is performed with a phantom and detects mineral crys-
tals that are in proper alignment. In contrast quantitative backscattered 
electron  imaging  or  three-dimensional  (3D)  computed  tomography 
(CT), which detect all mineral in 3D, reveals that both dominant and 
recessive (except types XIV and XV) OI bone is hypermineralized. On 
histomorphometry, dominant OI bone has proper formation of lamel-
lae but increased turnover, causing decreased bone volume. Type V OI 
has  mesh-like  bone  lamellae,  as  well  as  a  dislocated  radial  head,  and 
may have hyperplastic callus formation, while type VI OI has distinc-
tive fish scale lamellae on polarized light microscopy.

Many OI patients across the severity spectrum have increased liga-
mentous laxity. Patients with defects in processing the N-terminal pro-
peptide of type I procollagen have large and small joint hypermobility 
similar to EDS. Muscle weakness of unknown etiology also occurs in 
OI,  and  the  weakness  and  ligamentous  laxity  contribute  to  delayed 
motor development.

Pulmonary  The  leading  cause  of  death  in  OI  is  pulmonary  dis-
ease. Young children with severe OI often have repeated pneumonia; 
restrictive or obstructive disease often develops in adults. Pulmonary 
function is impaired by marked scoliosis and chest wall deformity but 
also arises from intrinsic defects of lung parenchyma containing type I 
collagen, as shown by declining pulmonary function over time in chil-
dren without scoliosis. Mice with null CRTAP mutations (type VII OI) 
have abnormal alveolar development, and patients with recessive forms 
also have pulmonary complications. Evaluation of even asymptomatic 
moderate to severe OI patients by spirometry should initiate standard 
pulmonary interventions.

Cardiovascular  Cardiovascular  effects  of  OI  manifest  predomi-
nantly in adults. With type I collagen as a major component of matrix 
in  cardiac  valves  and  aortic  wall,  the  most  frequent  manifestations 
are valvular, especially mitral regurgitation and aortic root dilatation. 
Impaired mechanical properties occasionally lead to aortic dissection. 
Echocardiography is appropriate with heart murmurs or cardiac symp-
toms and every 3–5 years in asymptomatic patients.

Dentinogenesis  Imperfecta  Dentinogenesis  imperfecta  (DI)  is 
associated with types III and IV OI and recessive types with collagen 
processing  defects.  Tooth  agenesis,  especially  of  premolars,  is  also 
found  in  types  III/IV  OI.  Teeth  with  disturbed  formation  of  dentin 
during  development  may  be  translucent  gray  or  have  yellowish  or 
brownish  discoloration.  Defects  are  manifest  predominantly  in  pri-
mary teeth; detection in secondary teeth may require radiographs to 
identify characteristic narrow or obliterated pulp chambers. Crumbling 
at the dentin-enamel junction may require capping of teeth. Hypoplas-
tic maxilla and relative mandibular prognathism in moderate to severe 
OI  can  result  in  type  III  malocclusion  and  impair  normal  chewing, 
requiring surgical correction.

Hearing Loss  About  half  of  patients  with  types  I,  III,  and  IV  OI 
develop hearing loss, but its incidence in recessive types is unknown. 
Hearing  loss  usually  begins  in  the  second  decade  and  progresses. 
The initial conductive loss, based on changes in the inner ear leading 
to  stapes  footplate  fixation,  can  evolve  into  a  mixed  conductive  and 
sensorineural loss. Regular screening allows referral for hearing aids, 
stapes surgery, or cochlear implants, as appropriate.

Other  Features  A  variable  intensity  of  blue  or  grayish  sclerae  is 
a  well-known  feature  of  OI.  The  color  is  most  striking  with  collagen 
defects, especially types I and II OI and defects that affect N-terminal 
procollagen  processing.  Blue  sclerae  often  occur  in  other  connective 
tissue  disorders  such  as  EDS  or  MFS  and  may  occur  in  individuals 
without connective tissue defects. Severe neonatal OI with white sclerae 
should  prompt  consideration  of  recessive  forms,  especially  prolyl 
3-hydroxylation defects. Abnormalities of the skull base, such as platy-
basia and basilar invagination, sometimes progress to clinically devast-
ing basilar impression. Patients with height Z-scores of <–3 should be 
CT scanned at 3- to 5-year intervals. Significant growth deficiency is a 
cardinal feature of OI, ranging from minimally shorter than siblings in 
mild forms to greater extents in some severe cases, with adults shorter 
than 5-year-old children. There is both end-organ resistance to growth 
hormone  (GH)  and  defective  transition  to  bone  at  the  growth  plate. 
Types I and IV OI are often responsive to recombinant GH therapy.

Molecular Defects  The great majority (80–85%) of cases of 
OI are caused by heterozygous mutations in either of the genes 
coding for the chains of type I procollagen, COL1A1 or COL1A2 
(Table 413-2). Although thousands of unique mutations have been iden-
tified  in  type  I  collagen,  they  fall  into  several  structural  types.  Null 
mutations in collagen chains are less detrimental than structural defects. 
Null mutations in COL1A1 result in about half the normal level of col-
lagen synthesis, but the collagen in matrix is structurally normal. These 
patients have mild type I OI. Null COL1A2 mutations are rare, leading 
to an EDS-like condition with progressive cardiac-valvular defects.

Mutations  that  produce  structural  changes  in  type  I  collagen  α 
chains cause types II, III, and IV OI. The most common of these are 
mutations  resulting  in  substitutions  for  glycine  residues  required  at 
every  third  residue  along  the  helix.  In  effect,  any  of  the  338  glycine 
residues  in  the  helical  domain  of  either  the  proα1  or  proα2  chain  of 
type I procollagen is a potential site for a disease-producing mutation. 
Other mutations affect the splicing of the exons encoding the α chains. 
Because each collagen exon encodes a discrete set of Gly-X-Y triplets, 
the abnormal splice products are most often in-frame and cause severe 
structural  abnormalities.  Use  of  alternative  splice  sites  may  lead  to 
premature termination, mimicking null mutations, and a milder phe-
notype. Structural abnormalities in the procollagen helical region delay 
collagen folding and expose chains to posttranslational hydroxylation/
glycosylation  for  a  longer  time.  The  abnormal  procollagen  triggers 
a  cascade  of  intracellular  and  extracellular  events  including  delayed 
collagen  folding,  ER  stress,  abnormal  interaction  with  noncollage-
nous molecules, impaired osteoblast development and cross-talk with 
osteoclasts, and abnormal mineralization. There are some special sets 
of procollagen structural mutations with distinct mechanisms within 
types II, III, and IV. Mutations in the C-propeptide significantly delay 
chain  assembly,  and  resulting  procollagen  is  mislocalized  to  the  ER 
lumen. Some of this procollagen is targeted for degradation by the ER- 
associated  proteosomal  pathway,  while  the  secreted  molecules  delay 
pericellular  processing  of  the  C-propeptide.  Mutations  in  the  C-pro-
peptide cleavage site itself prevent processing of the propeptide, leaving 
pC-collagen to be incorporated into matrix. This affects matrix miner-
alization, resulting in an unusual high bone mass form of OI that falls 
at the milder end of the type IV OI phenotype. Not surprisingly, null 
mutations in the C-propeptidase enzyme, BMP1, cause recessive type 
XII OI. Type XII OI is a severe condition because BMP1 is the cleavase 
for types I, II, and III procollagens and the glycoprotein decorin, which 
is a regulator of fibrillogenesis. Processing defects of the N-propeptide 
occur  in  the  cleavage  site  itself  or  the  90  helix  residues  at  the  amino 
end. The persistence of the N-propeptide on a fraction of the molecules

3224 interferes  with  the  self-assembly  of  normal  collagen  so  that  thin  and 
irregular collagen fibrils are formed. They cause extreme laxity of large 
and small joints, intensely blue sclerae, and an OI severity comparable 
to type III/IV. Rare substitutions of charged amino acids (Asp, Arg) or 
a branched amino acid (Val) in X- or Y-positions produce lethal pheno-
types, apparently because they are located at sites for lateral assembly of 
the monomers or binding of other components of the matrix.

Starting in 2006, a series of noncollagenous genes have been iden-
tified that cause (mostly) recessive OI. Importantly, all the genes have 
encoded proteins or cellular processes related to collagen, shifting the 
OI  paradigm  to  dominant  OI  caused  by  collagen  defects  or  IFITM5 
and recessive OI caused by proteins related to collagen modification, 
processing,  folding,  and  cross-linking  and  osteoblast  differentiation. 
The  largest  group  of  patients  with  OI  not  caused  by  collagen  gene 
mutations have types V and VI OI, affecting bone mineralization. Type V 
OI, with dominant inheritance, is unusual in that all patients have the 
same  recurrent  mutation  at  the  5′-end  of  IFITM5,  which  generates 
a  novel  start  codon  in  the  transmembrane  protein  BRIL.  The  gain- 
of-function  mutation  causes  distinctive  radiologic  (ossification  of 
interosseus membrane and dense metaphyseal band) and phenotypic 
findings  (hypertrophic  callus).  Osteoblasts  with  type  V  OI  have 
increased mineralization and differentiation in culture. Type VI OI is a 
recessive form caused by null mutations in PEDF, a collagen-interacting 
molecule  with  a  known  antiangiogenic  effect.  A  connection  between 
types V and VI OI has been revealed by a set of patients with a BRIL 
p.S42L  substitution  who  have  clinical,  histologic,  serum  marker,  and 
phenotypic  features  of  type  VI  OI.  Both  type  VI  OI  osteoblasts  and 
BRIL  p.S42L  osteoblasts  have  decreased  cellular  mineralization  and 
SERPINEF1  expression,  while  classic  type  V  OI  osteoblasts  have  the 
opposite findings. All three types decrease collagen production.

Types  VII,  VIII,  and  IX  OI  are  severe  recessive  forms  caused 
by  deficiency  of  one  of  the  components  of  the  procollagen  prolyl 
3-hydroxylation  complex,  P3H1,  CRTAP,  or  cyclophilin  B  (PPIB/
CyPB). This complex 3-hydroxylates one proline residue per α chain, 
most critically α1(I)P986, in contrast to the proline 4-hydroxylation of 
multiple helical residues by P4H1. In murine models, loss of complex 
function  results  in  a  severe  phenotype;  while  mutation  of  the  P986 
residue  impairs  collagen  cross-linking  and  fine-tuning  of  collagen 
alignment in fibrils. The phenotype of these patients is distinctive for 
white sclerae, rhizomelia, and lack of relative macrocephaly; they share 
the bone fragility, high bone turnover, and elevated bone mineraliza-
tion of classical OI.

Some recessive OI types that impair osteoblast function are caused 
by mutation in genes not previously understood to affect bone. Reg-
ulatory intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is well known for its role in 
cholesterol synthesis, in which cells transport regulatory proteins from 
the ER membrane to the Golgi membrane in times of cell stress, where 
S1P  and  S2P  Golgi  proteases  sequentially  cleave  the  transcription 
factors, activating them to enter the nucleus. X-linked type XVIII OI 
with defective MBTPS2/S2P and type XVI OI with deficiency of an RIP 
substrate Oasis, a member of the ATF6 family of stress sensors, indicate 
the importance of RIP for bone formation (Table 413-2).

Inheritance  and  Mosaicism  in  Germline  Cells  and  Somatic 
Cells  Types  I–V  OI  are  inherited  as  autosomal  dominant  traits, 
while  the  rare  forms  are  mostly  recessive.  Many  patients  with  mild 
dominant  OI  represent  familial  traits,  while  sporadic  new  mutations 
are  often  responsible  for  dominant  severe  or  lethal  cases.  Germline 
mosaicism  in  one  parent  may  be  the  etiology  of  a  severe  dominant 
mutation  in  the  child;  in  this  circumstance,  a  second  child  may  be 
affected  with  the  same  dominant  mutation  from  unaffected  parents. 
Recessive mutations in genes causing the rare forms of OI lead to more 
severe clinical outcomes; many of these offspring do not survive child-
hood,  but  moderately  to  severely  affected  young  adults  show  us  that 
these conditions must also be considered.

Diagnosis  OI  is  usually  diagnosed  on  the  basis  of  clinical  and 
radiographic  criteria.  The  presence  of  fractures  together  with  blue 
sclerae, DI, or family history of the disease is usually sufficient to make 

the diagnosis. X-rays reveal a decrease in bone density that can be ver-
ified by DXA bone densitometry, as well as characteristic deformities 
of long bones, thorax, and cranium. The differential diagnosis varies 
with age, including battered child syndrome, nutritional deficiencies, 
malignancies, and other inherited disorders such as chondrodysplasias 
and  hypophosphatasia  that  can  have  overlapping  presentations.  A 
molecular diagnosis is now routinely obtained using targeted candidate 
gene  sequencing,  sometimes  beginning  with  the  dominant  collagen 
and  IFITM5  panel.  Although  almost  all  cases  can  be  diagnosed  by 
sequencing, some may require bone histology and exome sequencing.

TREATMENT
Osteogenesis Imperfecta

Therapy  should  be  directed  toward  maximizing  the  function  of 
each individual, which includes decreasing fractures and deformity 
that interfere with function. Physical and occupational therapy are 
critical  modalities.  They  are  most  commonly  utilized  after  severe 
fractures or major surgery and should also be engaged consistently 
throughout the life span for maximizing mobility, functions of daily 
living, and the extent of physical conditioning possible. Water ther-
apy is particularly useful at all ages. Diet should include adequate 
intake of calcium and vitamin D. Many patients are underweight for 
height as young children but overweight as adults, and nutritional 
management may be useful. Orthopedic procedures are required for 
deformities of long bone that interfere with standing or walking or 
when a bone has sustained repeated fractures. Intramedullary rods 
are often inserted when children are ready to stand and as needed 
thereafter  to  keep  bone  segments  in  good  alignment  and  provide 
partial  unloading  of  weight  from  bones.  If  scoliosis  progresses, 
stabilization of the spine may be needed to maintain the curve at 
<60°.  Medical  management  should  also  include  presymptomatic 
screening  for  hearing  loss,  cardiac  valve  dysfunction,  pulmonary 
function, and, in severe individuals, basilar invagination.

Drugs  that  have  been  developed  for  the  therapy  of  postmeno-
pausal osteoporosis are beneficial for some patients. Bisphosphonates, 
antiresorptive  drugs  that  inhibit  osteoclasts,  increase  DXA  bone 
density and relieve vertebral compressions in most patients. They 
are regarded as a mainstay of care in many pediatric centers. How-
ever, several Cochran reports have not supported a clear reduction 
in  fracture  rate  or  bone  pain  from  their  use,  and  the  dosing  and 
duration  of  use  are  controversial.  Currently,  drugs  with  a  bone-
forming  mechanism  are  in  trials  for  OI,  especially  monoclonal 
antibodies  to  sclerostin  that  relieve  its  inhibition  of  osteoblast 
Wnt/β-catenin  signaling,  TGF-β  inhibitors,  and  a  PTH  analogue 
that  stimulates  osteoblasts  and  is  most  beneficial  for  adults  with 
milder OI. Potential therapies under investigation in animal models 
include chemical chaperones and mesenchymal stem cell therapy.

 ■ EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROMES
The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) comprise a genetically heteroge-
neous  group  of  heritable  conditions  that  share  several  characteristics 
such as soft and hyperextensible skin, abnormal wound healing, easy 
bruising,  and  joint  hypermobility.  Additional  clinical  features  that 
differ among the EDS subtypes include fragility of soft tissues, blood 
vessels, and hollow organs and involvement of the musculoskeletal sys-
tem. Mutations in genes coding for fibrillar collagens (type I, III, or V) 
are found in many patients, but other genes are affected in rare forms.

Classification  Several  types  of  EDS  have  been  defined,  based  on 
clinical  characteristics,  mode  of  inheritance,  and  molecular  defects 
(Table 413-3), and the classification of these types has been a dynamic 
process. The current classification defines 13 clinical EDS types that are 
caused by alterations in 19 different genes, but a recent study described 
another  genetically  distinct  EDS  type,  bringing  the  total  number  of 
EDS-associated genes to 20. The EDS classification guides the clinical 
diagnosis, molecular confirmation, and genetic counseling of affected 
individuals and their family members.

Incidence  An  incidence  of  about  1  in  5000  individuals  for  all 
forms of EDS was proposed, with no apparent ethnic predisposition. 
The diagnosis of hypermobile EDS is more common in females than 
in  males,  but  whether  this  is  due  to  an  increased  incidence  or  more 
severe  manifestation  is  unknown.  The  incidence  for  other  types  of 
EDS  is  similar  in  males  and  females.  With  incidences  of  1  in  20,000 
and  1  in  50,000–200,000  respectively,  classical  and  vascular  EDS  are 
the most common genetically elucidated types of EDS. For the other 
types of EDS for which causative variants have been identified, there 
are no incidence estimates, but the numbers of people who have been 
reported worldwide with these disorders range between ~5 and ~100 
individuals per EDS type. Patients with milder forms frequently do not 
seek medical attention.

Skin  One of the principal features of EDS is skin hyperextensibility, 
that is, the skin stretches easily but snaps back after release. The skin 
often has a smooth, soft, or velvety feel to it and can be thin and trans-
lucent. It is fragile and tears easily, even after minor trauma, and heals 
slowly. Widened and thin atrophic scars are frequently observed in dif-
ferent types of EDS. Especially in classical EDS, atrophic scarring may 
be widespread, especially over pressure points and exposed areas such 
as  the  forehead,  elbows,  knees,  and  shins,  with  marked  widening  of 
the scars, which are covered by a very thin inelastic skin (papyraceous 
scars).  Individuals  with  vascular  EDS  usually  do  not  have  a  velvety 
hyperextensible skin, but skin can be thin and translucent with visible 
superficial veins. Easy bruising is common to most types of EDS and 
may manifest itself as spontaneous or recurring hematomas. These may 
cause discoloration of the skin due to deposition of hemosiderin, often 
referred  to  as  “hemosiderotic”  scars,  especially  in  classical,  vascular, 
and periodontic EDS.

Ligament and Joint Changes 
Joint hypermobility, another car-
dinal sign, is variable in severity and usually, but not always, gener-
alized. While often an “asset” in childhood, it can become a serious 
burden  over  time,  often  complicated  by  repetitive  subluxations, 
dislocations, sprains, and chronic joint pain that is difficult to treat. 
Other observed musculoskeletal features include congenital bilateral 
hip dislocation, spine deformities (scoliosis, kyphosis), pectus defor-
mities (pectus carinatum, pectus excavatum), club feet and other con-
tractures, and in some rare types, a (mild) skeletal dysplasia. Muscle 
hypotonia is observed in a number of EDS types and, in combination 
with  joint  laxity,  may  cause  floppy  infant  syndrome  or  a  delay  in 
motor development.

Other Features  Signs of more generalized connective tissue weak-
ness and fragility can be observed in varying degrees and may help to 
distinguish between the different EDS types. Rupture of medium and 
large-sized arteries is typical of vascular EDS but has been reported in 
a few other types as well, i.e., classical and kyphoscoliotic type. Vascular 
EDS patients are also at increased risk for rupture of the gastrointesti-
nal tract, especially the sigmoid colon, and the gravid uterus. Valvular 
defects  and  aortic  root  dilatation  are  rare  and  are  also  restricted  to 
some of the rarer types of EDS. Obstetrical and pelvic complications 
such as cervical insufficiency, premature rupture of membranes, vagi-
nal  lacerations,  and  organ  prolapses  (uterus,  bladder,  rectum)  may 
occur. Sclerae may be blue, and more severe ophthalmologic compli-
cations,  including  keratoconus,  keratoglobus,  and  scleral  or  corneal 
rupture, may be observed in some rare types.

Molecular Defects  Subsets of patients with different types of 
EDS have mutations in the structural genes for fibrillar collagen 
types  I,  III,  and  V  (Table  413-3).  About  90%  of  classical  EDS 
patients harbor a heterozygous mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2 cod-
ing for type V collagen, a minor collagen found in association with type 
I  collagen.  Heterozygous  mutations  in  the  COL3A1  gene  for  type  III 
collagen, which is abundant in the blood vessel wall, are responsible for 
vascular  EDS.  Arthrochalasia  EDS  is  caused  by  heterozygous  muta-
tions in either COL1A1 or COL1A2 that make type I procollagen resis-
tant to cleavage by procollagen N-proteinase, whereas dermatosparaxis 
EDS  is  caused  by  biallelic  mutations  in  the  gene  that  codes  for  the

procollagen  N-proteinase  itself,  thereby  reducing  its  enzyme  activity. 
The persistence of the N-propeptide causes the formation of collagen 
fibrils  that  are  thin  and  irregular.  Other  specific  mutations  in  either 
COL1A1  or  COL1A2  give  rise  to  a  few  rare  subtypes  of  EDS.  These 
include the cardiac-valvular type, which is caused by biallelic COL1A2 
mutations, leading to a complete absence of α2(I) chains. Patients with 
this condition are at risk for severe, progressive cardiac-valvular disease 
necessitating valve replacement. A specific arginine-to-cysteine substi-
tution in the type I collagen α chain (p.Arg312Cys) is associated with 
an  EDS  phenotype  that  resembles  that  of  classical  EDS,  but  patients 
appear at increased risk for vascular rupture of medium-sized arteries. 
A few patients with a phenotype that couples EDS with signs of mod-
erate to severe myopathy harbor heterozygous or homozygous muta-
tions  in  COL12A1,  coding  for  type  XII  collagen,  a  fibril-associated 
collagen with interrupted triple helices. Kyphoscoliotic EDS is caused by 
biallelic  mutations  either  in  the  PLOD1  gene,  which  encodes  procol-
lagen-lysine  5-dioxygenase  (lysyl  hydroxylase  1),  an  enzyme  required 
for formation of stable cross-links in collagen fibers, or in the FKBP14 
gene, which encodes FKBP22, an endoplasmic resident molecular chap-
erone that acts as a quality control on the folded triple helix of type III 
collagen. Some patients with clinical characteristics that resemble those 
of  classical  EDS  harbor  biallelic  mutations  in  either  TNXB,  encoding 
tenascin X, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that appears to regulate 
the assembly of collagen fibers, or in AEBP1, which encodes the extra-
cellular  matrix–associated  adipocyte  enhancer-binding  protein 
(AEBP1), which assists in collagen polymerization. Spondylodysplastic 
EDS is caused by biallelic mutations in B3GALT7, coding for galactosyl-
transferase I, or in B3GALT6, coding for galactosyltransferase II, both 
key enzymes in the biosynthesis of the linker region of glycosaminogly-
cans. Musculocontractural EDS results from mutations in genes coding 
enzymes  responsible  for  dermatan  biosynthesis:  CHST14,  dermatan 
4-O-sulfotransferase  1,  and  DSE,  dermatan  sulfate  epimerase.  A  rare 
spondylodysplastic  type  of  EDS  is  caused  by  biallelic  mutations  in 
SLC39A13,  encoding  the  intracellular  zinc  transporter  ZIP13.  Brittle 
cornea syndrome is caused by biallelic mutations in either ZNF469 or 
PRDM5, both (putative) transcriptional regulators. Finally, periodontic 
EDS is caused by heterozygous mutations in C1R or C1S, coding for the 
complement pathway components C1q and C1s, respectively.

Diagnosis  Diagnostic workup comprises clinical examination and 
should be followed by genetic testing in individuals who are suspected 
to have an EDS subtype. Genetic testing can include targeted mutation 
analysis  in  those  with  a  family  history  of  EDS  caused  by  a  known 
genetic variant or, more frequently, next-generation sequencing using 
multigene panels. Genetic diagnosis should lead to family testing. Of 
note, the genetic cause of hypermobile EDS has not been determined, 
and therefore, diagnosis of this condition is based on the presence of 
clinical manifestations. Correlations between genotype and phenotype 
are challenging and only starting to emerge, and as with other herita-
ble diseases of connective tissue, there is a large degree of variability 
among members of the same family carrying the same mutation.

TREATMENT
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
All  patients  with  EDS  should  receive  multidisciplinary  care  and, 
if available, be part of a patient advocacy community. The precise 
treatment depends on the subtype of EDS and the clinical manifes-
tations. Physiotherapy is essential for patients with musculoskeletal 
problems.  Helmets  and/or  skin  protections  or  joint  protections, 
braces, or splints can be used to reduce the risk of injury in patients 
with skin fragility or joint hypermobility. Low-resistance exercises 
(such as walking or swimming) can improve joint stability, although 
exercises that place considerable strain on the joints (such as gym-
nastics or weightlifting) should be avoided. Monitoring for cardio-
vascular alterations using noninvasive procedures is recommended 
in patients at risk of adverse cardiovascular events only. Given the 
rarity of vascular EDS, referral to a center with EDS expertise is of 
vital importance. A clear protocol for emergency room evaluation

in  the  case  of  major  complications  should  be  established,  and 
patients  should  carry  documentation  of  their  genetic  diagnosis, 
such as a MedicAlert. The psychosocial impact of a vascular EDS 
diagnosis often requires psychological care.

 ■ CHONDRODYSPLASIAS
(See  also  Chap.  412)  Chondrodysplasias  (CDs),  also  referred  to  as 
skeletal dysplasias or osteochondrodysplasias, encompass a heteroge-
neous  group  of  disorders  characterized  by  intrinsic  abnormalities  of 
cartilage  and  bone  and  are  generally  characterized  by  dwarfism  and 
abnormal  body  proportions  (disproportionate  short  stature).  Many 
affected individuals develop degenerative joint changes, and mild CD 
in adults may be difficult to differentiate from primary generalized OA.

Classification  The Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal 
Disorders  comprises  461  distinct  disorders  based  on  clinical,  radio-
graphic,  and/or  molecular  phenotypes.  Pathogenic  variants  affecting 
437 different genes have currently been found in 425 of 461 (92%) of 
these  disorders.  The  conditions  are  divided  into  42  groups  based  on 
gene/protein families (e.g., the type II collagen group), phenotypic pre-
sentation (e.g., spondylometaphyseal dysplasia), and pathophysiology 
(i.e.,  lysosomal  storage  disorders).  One  gene  may  be  responsible  for 
more than one condition (e.g., COL2A1 mutations may cause achon-
drogenesis type 2, hypochondrogenesis, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia 
congenita, Kniest and Stickler syndromes), or a condition may be due 
to mutations in more than one gene (e.g., geleophysic dysplasia can be 
caused by mutations in ADAMTSL2, FBN1, and LTBP3).

Incidence  The overall incidence of all forms of CD ranges from 1 per 
2500 to 1 per 4000 births. Data on the frequency of individual CDs are 
incomplete, but the incidence of Stickler syndrome is estimated to range 
between 1 in 7500 and 1 in 9000. Therefore, the disease is probably among 
the more common heritable disorders of connective tissue. The most com-
mon form of inherited disproportionate short stature is achondroplasia, 
with an estimated incidence of 1 per 26,000 to 1 per 28,000 live births.

Molecular  Defects  Mutations  in  the  COL2A1  gene,  coding 
for the α chain of type II collagen of cartilage, are found in a group 
of patients with both mild and severe CDs. For example, a muta-
tion  in COL2A1  substituting  a  cysteine  residue  for  an  arginine  was 
found in a few unrelated families with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia 
(SED)  and  precocious  generalized  OA.  Mutations  in  the  gene  were 
also found in some lethal CDs characterized by gross deformities of 
bones and cartilage, such as those found in SED congenita, spondy-
loepimetaphyseal  dysplasia  congenita,  hypochondrogenesis/achon-
drogenesis  type  II,  and  Kniest  syndrome.  The  highest  incidence  of 
COL2A1 mutations, however, occurs in patients with the distinctive 
features of the Stickler syndrome, which is characterized by skeletal 
changes,  orofacial  abnormalities,  and  ophthalmologic  and  auditory 
abnormalities. Most of the mutations in COL2A1 are premature stop 
codons  that  produce  haploinsufficiency.  In  addition,  some  of  the 
patients  with  Stickler  syndrome  or  a  closely  related  syndrome  have 
mutations in two genes specific for type XI collagen (COL11A1 and 
COL11A2), which is an unusual heterotrimer formed from α chains 
encoded  by  COL2A1,  COL11A1,  and  COL11A2.  Mutations  in  the 
COL11A1  gene  are  also  found  in  patients  with  Marshall  syndrome, 
which  is  similar  to  classic  Stickler  syndrome,  but  with  more  severe 
hearing loss and dysmorphic features, such as a flat or retracted mid-
face  with  a  flat  nasal  bridge,  short  nose,  anteverted  nostrils,  long 
philtrum, and large-appearing eyes.

CDs  are  also  caused  by  mutations  in  the  less  abundant  collagens 
found  in  cartilage.  For  example,  patients  with  Schmid  metaphyseal 
CD have mutations in the gene for type X collagen, a short, network-
forming  collagen  found  in  the  hypertrophic  zone  of  endochondral 
cartilage.  The  syndrome  is  characterized  by  short  stature,  coxa  vara, 
flaring metaphyses, and waddling gait. As with other collagen genes, 
the most common mutations are of two types: nonsense mutations that 
lead to  haploinsufficiency  and  structural mutations  that compromise 
collagen assembly.

Some patients have mutations in genes for proteins that interact with 
collagens. Patients with pseudoachondroplasia or autosomal dominant 
multiple epiphyseal dysplasia have mutations in the gene for the carti-
lage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a protein that interacts with 
both collagens and proteoglycans in cartilage. However, some families 
with  multiple  epiphyseal  dysplasia  have  a  defect  in  one  of  the  three 
genes  for  type  IX  collagen  (COL9A1,  COL9A2,  and  COL9A3)  or  in 
matrilin-3, another extracellular protein found in cartilage.

Some CDs are caused by mutations in genes that affect early devel-
opment  of  cartilage  and  related  structures.  Achondroplasia  is  caused 
by mutations in the gene for a receptor for a fibroblastic growth factor 
(FGFR3).  The  mutations  in  the  FGFR3  gene  causing  achondroplasia 
are  unusual  in  several  respects.  A  single-base  mutation  in  the  gene 
that  converts  glycine  to  arginine  at  position  380  in  the  FGFR3  gene 
is  present  in  >90%  of  patients.  Most  patients  harbor  a  sporadic  new 
mutation,  and  therefore,  this  nucleotide  change  is  one  of  the  most 
common  recurring  mutations  in  the  human  genome.  The  mutation 
causes  unregulated  signal  transduction  through  the  receptor  and 
inappropriate  development  of  cartilage.  Mutations  that  alter  other 
domains of FGFR3 have been found in patients with the more severe 
disorders of hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia and in a 
few families with a variant of craniosynostosis. However, most patients 
with craniosynostosis appear to have mutations in the related FGFR2 
gene. The similarities between the phenotypes produced by mutations 
in genes for fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors and mutations in 
structural proteins of cartilage are probably explained by the observa-
tion that the activity of FGFs is regulated in part by binding of FGFs 
to proteins sequestered in the extracellular matrix. Therefore, the sit-
uation parallels the interactions between transforming growth factors 
(TGFs) and fibrillin in MFS (see below).

Other  mutations  involve  the  proteoglycans  of  cartilage,  aggrecan 
(AGC1)  and  perlecan  (HSPG2),  and  in  the  proteoglycan  posttransla-
tional sulphation pathway (DTDST, PAPSS2, and CHST3). Mutations 
in >45 other genes have been defined in CDs.

Diagnosis  The diagnosis of CDs is made on the basis of the phys-
ical appearance, slit-lamp eye examinations, x-ray findings, histologic 
changes, and clinical course. Targeted gene and exome sequencing or 
more  global  sequencing  strategies  are  used  for  molecular  diagnosis. 
Given  the  wide  spectrum  of  CD  phenotypes,  these  genetic  tests  are 
becoming critical diagnostic tools. For Stickler syndrome, more precise 
diagnostic criteria have made it possible to identify type I variants with 
mutations in the COL2A1 gene with a high degree of accuracy. It has 
been suggested that the type II variant with mutations in the COL11A1 
gene can be identified on the basis of a “beaded” vitreous phenotype 
and that the type III variant with mutations in the COL11A2 gene can 
be identified on the basis of the characteristic systemic features without 
the ocular involvement. Prenatal diagnosis based on analysis of DNA 
obtained from chorionic villus or amniotic fluid is possible.

TREATMENT
Chondrodysplasias
The treatment of CDs is symptomatic and is directed to secondary 
features such as degenerative arthritis. Many patients require joint 
replacement  surgery  and  corrective  surgery  for  cleft  palate.  The 
eyes should be monitored carefully for the development of cataracts 
and  the  need  for  laser  therapy  to  prevent  retinal  detachment.  In 
general,  patients  should  be  advised  to  avoid  obesity  and  contact 
sports. Counseling for the psychological problems of short stature 
is critical. Several clinical trials therapeutically targeting the FGFR3 
pathway in achondroplasia are underway.

 ■ HERITABLE THORACIC AORTIC  
ANEURYSM DISEASE
Heritable  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm  disease  (HTAD)  encompasses 
conditions  in  which  aortic  disease  has  a  familial  occurrence,  due  to 
an  underlying  genetic  defect.  HTAD  is  classified  as  syndromic  or

nonsyndromic. Syndromic HTAD may associate with ocular, craniofa-
cial, musculoskeletal, and skin features, with a recognizable, yet some-
time subtle, phenotype. They are caused by mutations in genes that code 
for  extracellular  matrix  proteins.  Besides  syndromic  HTAD,  there  are 
several  nonsyndromic  forms  of  HTAD;  patients  with  these  conditions 
do  not  display  an  outward  recognizable  phenotype  and  are  classified 
as  having  familial  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm  (FTAA).  More  extensive 
genetic screening in cohorts of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm is, 
however, slowly revealing that there is no strict boundary between syn-
dromic and nonsyndromic HTAD entities (Table 413-4) (Chap. 280).

Classification  The  most  common  form  of  syndromic  HTAD  is 
MFS, caused by mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1). MFS was 
initially  characterized  by  a  triad  of  features:  (1)  skeletal  changes  that 
include long, thin extremities, frequently associated with loose joints; 
(2)  reduced  vision  as  the  result  of  dislocations  of  the  lenses  (ectopia 
lentis); and (3) aortic aneurysms. An international panel has developed 
a series of revised Ghent criteria that are useful in classifying patients. 
Other  major  syndromic  HTADs  include  different  genetic  variants  of 
Loeys-Dietz  syndrome  (LDS)  (TGFBR1,  TGFBR2,  TGFB2,  TGFB3, 
SMAD2,  and  SMAD3)  and  vascular  EDS  (COL3A1).  Rare  forms  of 
syndromic  HTAD  include  Shprintzen-Goldberg  syndrome  (SKI), 
Meester-Loeys  syndrome  (BGN),  and  arterial  tortuosity  syndrome 
(ATS) (SLC2A10).

Incidence and Inheritance  The incidence of MFS is among the 
highest of any heritable disorder: ~1 in 3000–5000 births in most racial 
and ethnic groups. The related syndromes are less common. Mutations 
are  generally  inherited  as  autosomal  dominant  traits,  but  about  one-
fourth  of  patients  have  sporadic  new  mutations.  The  LDSs  are  less 
common, but their exact incidence is currently unknown.

Skeletal  Effects  Patients  with  MFS  typically  display  a  marfanoid 
habitus with tall stature and long limbs. The ratio of the upper segment 
(top of the head to the top of the pubic ramus) to the lower segment 
(top of the pubic ramus to the floor) is usually 2 standard deviations 
below mean for age, race, and sex. The fingers and hands are long and 
slender  and  have  a  spider-like  appearance  (arachnodactyly).  Over-
lapping features in MFS and LDS include scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis; 
anterior chest deformities, including pectus excavatum, pectus carina-
tum,  or  asymmetry;  pes  planus;  pneumothorax;  and  dural  ectasia.  A 
few patients have severe joint hypermobility similar to EDS. Clubfeet, 
joint  contractures,  and  cervical  spine  instability  are  more  frequently 
observed  in  LDS.  Patients  with  SMAD3  mutations  are  particularly 
prone to premature OA.

Cardiovascular  Features  Cardiovascular  abnormalities  are  the 
major  source  of  morbidity  and  mortality  both  in  MFS  and  LDS 
(Chap. 280). Patients with MFS often have mitral valve prolapse that 
develops early in life and that progresses to mitral valve regurgitation 
of increasing severity in about one-quarter of patients. Dilation of the 
root of the aorta and the sinuses of Valsalva are characteristic and omi-
nous features of MFS that can develop at any age. The rate of dilation 
is  unpredictable,  but  it  can  lead  to  aortic  regurgitation,  dissection  of 
the aorta, and rupture. Dilation is probably accelerated by physical and 
emotional stress as well as by pregnancy. Cardiovascular features of LDS 
also include dilatation of the aortic root at the level of the sinus of Val-
salva, which can progress to dissection or rupture when left untreated. 
LDS is also known for its involvement of aneurysms affecting arterial 
branches of head, neck, thoracic and abdominal aorta, lung, and lower 
extremities and for the presence or tortuosity of these vessels. In con-
trast to MFS, congenital heart malformations are often noted.

Ocular  Features  Myopia  is  the  most  common  ocular  feature  of 
MFS and often presents in early childhood. Displacement of the lens 
from  the  center  of  the  pupil  (ectopia  lentis)  occurs  in  ~60%  of  MFS 
patients. The ocular globe is frequently elongated. Retinal detachment, 
early cataract formation, and glaucoma can occur. Ectopia lentis does 
not  usually  occur  in  LDS,  but  other  ocular  features  may  be  present, 
such as blue sclerae, strabismus, amblyopia, and myopia.

Other Features  MFS patients typically have a high arched palate. 
Patients  with  LDS  characteristically  display  hypertelorism  (widely 
spaced  eyes)  and  cleft  palate  or  bifid  (split)  uvula.  They  may  also 
have craniosynostosis. Shared mucocutaneous features include striae, 
typically over the shoulders and buttocks, and inguinal and incisional 
hernias.  Patients  with  LDS  may  display  more  EDS-like  skin  features, 
such as thin translucent skin and widened scars.

Molecular Defects  More than 90% of patients clinically clas-
sified as having MFS by the Ghent criteria have a mutation in the 
gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1). Mutations in the same gene are found 
in a few patients who do not meet the Ghent criteria. Most FBN1 gene 
mutations are unique and are scattered throughout its 65 coding exons. 
Approximately  10%  are  recurrent  new  mutations  that  are  largely 
located in CpG sequences known to be “hot spots.” About one-third of 
the  mutations  introduce  premature  termination  codons,  and  about 
two-thirds are missense mutations that alter calcium-binding domains 
in the repetitive epidermal growth factor–like domains of the protein. 
Rarer mutations alter the processing of the protein. As in many genetic 
diseases, the severity of the phenotype cannot be predicted from the

nature  of  the  mutation.  In  LDS,  components  of  the  TGF-β  signaling 
pathway  are  mutated,  including  the  cytokines  (TGFβ2,  TGFβ3),  the 
receptors (TGFBR1, TGFBR2), and the downstream effectors (SMAD2, 
SMAD3).

The discovery that syndromes similar to MFS are caused by altera-
tions  in  the  TGF-β  signaling  pathway  refocused  attention  on  struc-
tural  similarity  between  fibrillin-1  and  TGF-β  binding  proteins  that 
sequester TGF-β in the extracellular matrix. As a result, some of the 
manifestations  of  MFS  have  been  shown  to  arise  from  alterations  in 
binding sites that modulate TGF-β bioavailability during development 
of the skeleton and other tissues. In both MFS and LDS, the pathogenic 
mechanisms involve increased TGF-β signaling, which contributes to 
aneurysm formation.

Diagnosis  When HTAD is present, genetic testing can confirm the 
diagnosis and allow identification of at-risk individuals. Referral to a 
specialty genetics service is critically important, and genetic counseling 
before testing is recommended. In view of phenotypic overlap between 
the syndromic HTAD, a multigene panel (usually including genes for 
syndromic  and  nonsyndromic  HTAD)  is  recommended.  All  patients 
with a suspected diagnosis of MFS should have a slit-lamp examination 
and  an  echocardiogram.  Also,  homocystinuria  should  be  ruled  out 
by amino acid analysis of plasma (Chap. 420). The diagnosis of MFS 
according  to  the  international  Ghent  standards  places  emphasis  on 
two cardinal features, dilation of the ascending aorta with or without 
dissection and ectopia lentis. Other cardiovascular and ocular manifes-
tations and findings in other organ systems such as the skeleton, dura, 
skin,  and  lungs  contribute  to  a  systemic  score  that  guides  diagnosis 
when aortic disease is present but ectopia lentis is not.

TREATMENT
Marfan Syndrome and Loeys-Dietz Syndromes
Patients  should  be  advised  that  vascular  risks  are  increased  by 
severe  physical  exertion,  smoking,  emotional  stress,  and  preg-
nancy. Low-level moderate aerobic exercise and limits on isometric 
exercise are recommended. Prophylactic beta blocker and/or angi-
otensin II receptor blocker therapy are prescribed in normotensive 
individuals, and blood pressure control is important for those with 
hypertension.  Surgical  correction  of  the  aorta,  aortic  valve,  and 
mitral  valve  has  been  successful  in  many  patients,  but  tissues  are 
frequently friable. The scoliosis tends to be progressive, and surgi-
cal  stabilization  may  be  required.  Dislocated  lenses  rarely  require 
surgical removal, but patients should be followed closely for retinal 
detachment.

414 Hemochromatosis

Lawrie W. Powell, David M. Frazer

 ■ DEFINITION
Hemochromatosis  is  a  relatively  common  inherited  disorder  of  iron 
metabolism  prevalent  in  European  populations.  Once  thought  to  be  a 
single disease entity, it is now known to be an iron-storage disorder with 
genetic heterogeneity but with a final common metabolic pathway result-
ing in the inappropriately high cellular release of iron. This leads to an 
increase in intestinal iron absorption and the deposition of excess iron in 
parenchymal cells with eventual tissue damage and organ failure. Thus, 
the term hemochromatosis now refers to a group of genetic diseases that 
predispose to iron overload, potentially leading to fibrosis and organ fail-
ure. Cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, cardiomyopathy, and 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are the major clinical manifestations.

The following terminology is widely accepted.

1.  Hereditary hemochromatosis is most often caused by a mutation in 
the homeostatic iron regulator (HFE) gene, which is tightly linked to 
the HLA-A locus on chromosome 6p. Persons who are homozygous 
for the mutation are at increased risk of iron overload and account 
for  80–90%  of  clinical  hereditary  hemochromatosis  in  persons  of 
northern European descent. In such subjects, the presence of hepatic 
fibrosis, cirrhosis, arthropathy, or hepatocellular carcinoma consti-
tutes iron overload–related disease. Rarer forms of non-HFE hemo-
chromatosis are caused by mutations in other genes involved in iron 
metabolism (Table 414-1). The disease can be recognized during its 
early stages when iron overload and organ damage are minimal. At 
this stage, the disease is best referred to as early hemochromatosis or 
precirrhotic hemochromatosis.

2.  Secondary iron overload occurs as a result of an iron-loading anemia, 
such as thalassemia or sideroblastic anemia, in which erythropoiesis 
is increased but ineffective. In the acquired iron-loading disorders, 
massive iron deposits in parenchymal tissues can lead to the same 
clinical and pathologic features as in hemochromatosis.

 ■ PREVALENCE
Although  HFE-associated  hemochromatosis  mutations  are  common, 
the  prevalence  varies  in  different  ethnic  groups.  It  is  most  common 
in  populations  of  northern  European  extraction  in  whom  ~1  in  10 
persons  are  heterozygous  carriers  and  0.3–0.5%  are  homozygotes, 
with even higher percentages in some Celtic populations such as those 
residing in Ireland and Brittany. However, expression of the disease is 
variable and modified by several factors, especially alcohol consump-
tion, dietary iron intake, blood loss associated with menstruation and 
pregnancy,  and  blood  donation.  Recent  population  studies  indicate 
that ~30% of homozygous men develop iron overload–related disease 
and  about  6%  develop  hepatic  cirrhosis.  For  women,  iron  overload–
related disease is closer to 1%. In addition, there are as yet unidentified 
modifying genes responsible for expression. Nearly 70% of untreated 
patients  develop  the  first  symptoms  between  ages  40  and  60.  The 
disease is rarely evident before age 20, although with family screening 
(see  “Screening  for  Hemochromatosis,”  below)  and  periodic  health 

examinations, asymptomatic subjects with iron overload can be identi-
fied, including young menstruating women.

In  contrast  to  HFE-associated  hemochromatosis,  the  non- 
HFE-associated  forms  of  hemochromatosis  (Table  414-1)  are  rare, 
but they affect all populations and may affect young people (juvenile 
hemochromatosis).

These result from mutations in one or more of the genes encoding 
proteins  in  the  hepcidin  pathway  (Fig.  414-1),  including  hepcidin, 
hemojuvelin, and transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2). The resultant clinical 
disease is very similar to HFE-related disease because they all lead to 
hepcidin deficiency, which is the final common pathway (Fig. 414-1).

A rare autosomal dominant form of hemochromatosis results from 
two types of mutations in the gene for the iron transporter ferroportin. 
Loss-of-function  mutations  decrease  the  cell  surface  localization  of 
ferroportin  in  certain  tissues,  thereby  reducing  its  ability  to  export 
iron (“ferroportin disease”). A second mutation abolishes the hepcid-
in-induced ferroportin internalization and degradation resulting in a

FIGURE  414-1  Pathways  of  normal  iron  homeostasis.  Dietary  inorganic  iron  traverses  the  brush  border  membrane  of  duodenal  enterocytes  via  divalent  metal-ion 
transporter 1 (DMT1) after reduction of ferric (Fe3+) iron to the ferrous (Fe2+) state by intestinal ferrireductases such as duodenal cytochrome B (DCYTB). Iron then moves 
from the enterocyte to the circulation via a process requiring the basolateral iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) and the iron oxidase hephaestin (Heph). In the circulation, iron 
binds to plasma transferrin and is thereby distributed to sites of iron utilization and storage. Much of the diferric transferrin supplies iron to immature erythrocyte cells in the 
bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis. At the end of their life, senescent red blood cells (RBCs) are phagocytosed by macrophages, and iron is returned to the circulation 
after export through ferroportin. The liver-derived peptide hepcidin represses basolateral iron transport in the gut as well as iron released from macrophages and other 
cells and serves as a central regulator of body-iron traffic. At least two separate signals regulate hepcidin production in response to changes in body-iron requirements. 
The first involves the detection of circulating diferric transferrin by HFE and TFR2. A second relies on hepatic iron stores activating the hemojuvelin (HJV)-dependent bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD pathway. This pathway is modified by erythroferrone released from erythroid precursor cells, which binds to BMP6 and inhibits its 
function. TMPRSS6 is a protease that regulates hepcidin production, possibly by modulating HJV activity. Heme is metabolized by heme oxygenase within the enterocytes, 
and the released iron then follows the same pathway. Mutations in the genes encoding HFE, TFR2, HJV, and hepcidin all lead to decreased hepcidin release and increased 
iron absorption, resulting in hemochromatosis (Table 414-1).

HFE-related disease (e.g., in parenchymal cells).

 ■ GENETIC BASIS

The most common mutation in the HFE gene is a homozygous G 
to A transition that leads to a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at 
position 282 (C282Y) of the HFE protein. It has been identified in 
85–90% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis in populations of 
northern  European  descent  but  is  found  in  only  60%  of  cases  from 
Mediterranean populations. A second, relatively common HFE variant 
(H63D) results in a substitution of aspartic acid for histidine at residue 
63 of the HFE protein. Homozygosity for H63D is not associated with 
clinically  significant  iron  overload.  Some  compound  heterozygotes 
(i.e.,  one  copy  each  of  C282Y  and  H63D)  have  mild  to  moderately 
increased body-iron stores but develop clinical disease only in associa-
tion  with  cofactors  such  as  heavy  alcohol  intake  or  hepatic  steatosis. 
HFE-associated hemochromatosis is inherited as an autosomal reces-
sive  trait,  and  heterozygotes  have  no,  or  minimal,  increase  in  iron 
stores. However, this slight increase in hepatic iron can act as a cofactor 
that  may  modify  the  expression  of  other  diseases  such  as  porphyria 
cutanea tarda (PCT) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Mutations in other genes involved in iron metabolism are respon-
sible  for  non-HFE-associated  hemochromatosis,  including  juvenile 
hemochromatosis,  which  affects  persons  in  the  second  and  third 
decades of life (Table 414-1). Mutations in the genes encoding hepcidin, 
TFR2, and hemojuvelin (Fig. 414-1) result in clinicopathologic features 
that  are  indistinguishable  from  HFE-associated  hemochromatosis. 
However, loss-of-function mutations in ferroportin, which is responsi-
ble for the efflux of iron from most cell types, result in iron loading of 
reticuloendothelial macrophages as well as parenchymal cells.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND THE  
ROLE OF HEPCIDIN
Normally, the body-iron content of 3–4 g is maintained such that intes-
tinal mucosal absorption of iron is equal to iron loss. This amount is 
~1 mg/d in men and 1.5 mg/d in menstruating women. In hemochro-
matosis,  mucosal  absorption  is  greater  than  body  requirements  and 
amounts to ≥4 mg/d. The progressive accumulation of iron increases 
plasma iron and saturation of transferrin and results in a progressive 
increase of plasma ferritin (Fig. 414-2). The discovery of a key regula-
tory hormone that allows the bone marrow and other tissues to com-
municate their iron requirements has transformed our understanding 
of  the  coordination  of  absorption,  mobilization,  and  storage  of  iron 
to  meet  body  iron  requirements.  It  was  called  hepcidin  based  upon 
its  antibacterial  activity  (“HEPatic  bacterioCIDal  proteIN”).  This 
liver-derived peptide represses basolateral iron export from intestinal 
enterocytes  and  iron  release  from  macrophages  and  other  cells  by 
binding  to  ferroportin.  Hepcidin,  in  turn,  responds  to  signals  in  the 
liver mediated by HFE, TFR2, and hemojuvelin (Fig. 414-1). The devel-
opment  of  hepcidin  agonists  represents  a  promising  new  therapeutic 
approach for iron overload disorders caused by low hepcidin levels.

The HFE gene encodes a 343-amino-acid protein that is structurally 
related  to  MHC  class  I  proteins.  The  basic  defect  in  HFE-associated 
hemochromatosis is a lack of cell surface expression of HFE (due to the 
C282Y mutation). The normal (wild-type) HFE protein forms a com-
plex with β2-microglobulin and transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), and the 
C282Y mutation completely abrogates this interaction. As a result, the 
mutant HFE protein remains trapped intracellularly. Although the pre-
cise function of HFE at the cell surface is not known, mutations in this 
protein reduce hepcidin production leading to increased dietary iron 
absorption (Fig. 414-1). In advanced disease, the body may contain 20 
g or more of iron, which is deposited mainly in parenchymal cells of 
the liver, pancreas, and heart. Iron deposition in the pituitary causes 
hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  in  both  men  and  women.  Tissue 
injury may result from disruption of iron-laden lysosomes, from lipid 
peroxidation of subcellular organelles by excess iron, or from stimula-
tion of collagen synthesis by activated stellate cells.

Secondary iron overload with iron deposition in parenchymal cells 
occurs in chronic disorders of erythropoiesis, particularly in those with

defects in hemoglobin synthesis and ineffective erythropoiesis such as 
sideroblastic  anemia  and  thalassemia  (Chap.  98).  In  these  disorders, 
iron  absorption  is  increased.  Moreover,  these  patients  require  blood 
transfusions  and  are  frequently  treated  inappropriately  with  iron. 
PCT,  a  disorder  characterized  by  a  defect  in  porphyrin  biosynthesis 
(Chap. 416), can also be associated with excessive parenchymal iron 
deposits. The magnitude of the iron load in PCT is usually insufficient 
to produce tissue damage. However, some patients with PCT also have 
mutations in the HFE gene, and some have associated hepatitis C virus 
(HCV)  infection.  Although  the  relationship  between  these  disorders 
remains to be clarified, iron overload accentuates the inherited enzyme 
deficiency  in  PCT  and  should  be  avoided  along  with  other  agents 
(alcohol,  estrogens,  haloaromatic  compounds)  that  may  exacerbate 
PCT. Another cause of hepatic parenchymal iron overload is hereditary 
aceruloplasminemia. In this disorder, impairment of iron mobilization 
due to deficiency of ceruloplasmin (a ferroxidase) causes iron overload 
in hepatocytes and a range of other cell types.

Excessive iron ingestion over many years rarely results in hemochro-
matosis.  An  important  exception  has  been  reported  in  South  Africa 
among groups who brew fermented beverages in vessels made of iron. 
Hemochromatosis  has  been  described  in  apparently  normal  persons 
who have taken medicinal iron over many years, but such individuals 
probably had genetic disorders.

The  common  denominator  in  all  patients  with  hemochromatosis  is 
excessive amounts of iron in parenchymal tissues. Parenteral administra-
tion of iron in the form of blood transfusions or iron preparations results 
predominantly in reticuloendothelial cell iron overload. This appears to 
lead to less tissue damage than iron loading of parenchymal cells.

In the liver, parenchymal iron is in the form of ferritin and hemosid-
erin.  In  the  early  stages,  these  deposits  are  seen  in  the  periportal 
parenchymal  cells,  especially  within  lysosomes  in  the  pericanalicular 
cytoplasm  of  the  hepatocytes.  This  stage  progresses  to  perilobular 
fibrosis  and  to  fibrous  septa  due  to  activation  of  stellate  cells.  In  the 
advanced  stage,  a  macronodular  or  mixed  macro-  and  micronodular 
cirrhosis develops. Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis correlate significantly 
with hepatic iron concentration.

Histologically,  iron  is  increased  in  many  organs,  particularly  in 
the liver, heart, and pancreas, and, to a lesser extent, in the endocrine

glands. The epidermis of the skin is thin, and melanin is increased in 
the  cells  of  the  basal  layer  and  dermis.  Deposits  of  iron  are  present 
around the synovial lining cells of the joints.
 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
C282Y homozygotes can be characterized by the stage of progression as 
follows: (1) a genetic predisposition without abnormalities; (2) iron over-
load without symptoms; (3) iron overload with symptoms (e.g., arthritis 
and fatigue); and (4) iron overload with organ damage—in particular, cir-
rhosis. Thus, many subjects with significant iron overload are asymptom-
atic. For example, in a study of 672 asymptomatic C282Y homozygous 
subjects (identified by either family screening or routine health exami-
nations) there was hepatic iron overload (grades 2–4) in 56% and 34.5% 
of male and female subjects, respectively, hepatic fibrosis (stages 2–4) in 
18.4% and 5.4%, respectively, and cirrhosis in 5.6% and 1.9%, respectively.
Initial  symptoms  of  hemochromatosis  are  often  nonspecific  and 
include  lethargy,  arthralgia,  skin  pigmentation,  loss  of  libido,  and 
features  of  diabetes  mellitus.  Hepatomegaly,  increased  pigmentation, 
spider  angiomas,  splenomegaly,  arthropathy,  ascites,  cardiac  arrhyth-
mias, congestive heart failure, loss of body hair, testicular atrophy, and 
jaundice are prominent in advanced disease.

The liver is usually the first organ to be affected, and hepatomegaly 

is present in >95% of symptomatic patients.

Manifestations of portal hypertension and esophageal varices occur 
less commonly than in cirrhosis from other causes. Hepatocellular car-
cinoma develops in ~30% of patients with cirrhosis, and it is the most 
common cause of death in treated patients—hence the importance of 
early diagnosis and therapy. The incidence increases with age, it is more 
common in men, and it occurs almost exclusively in cirrhotic patients.
Excessive  skin  pigmentation  is  present  in  patients  with  advanced 
disease.  The  characteristic  metallic  or  slate-gray  hue  is  sometimes 
referred to as bronzing and results from increased melanin and iron in 
the dermis. Pigmentation usually is diffuse and generalized.

Diabetes mellitus occurs in ~65% of patients with advanced disease 
and is more likely to develop in those with a family history of diabetes, 
suggesting that direct damage to the pancreatic islets by iron deposi-
tion occurs in combination with other risk factors. The management is 
similar to that of other forms of diabetes.

Arthropathy develops in 25–50% of symptomatic patients. It usually 
occurs after age 50, but may occur as a first manifestation or long after 
therapy. The joints of the hands, especially the second and third meta-
carpophalangeal joints, are usually the first joints involved, a feature that 
helps to distinguish the chondrocalcinosis associated with hemochroma-
tosis from the idiopathic form (Chap. 372). A progressive polyarthritis 
involving  the  wrists,  hips,  ankles,  and  knees  may  also  ensue.  Acute 
brief attacks of synovitis may be associated with deposition of calcium 
pyrophosphate (chondrocalcinosis or pseudogout), mainly in the knees. 
Radiologic  manifestations  include  cystic  changes  of  the  subchondral 
bones, loss of articular cartilage with narrowing of the joint space, dif-
fuse demineralization, hypertrophic bone proliferation, and calcification 
of the synovium. The arthropathy tends to progress despite removal of 
iron by phlebotomy. Although the relation of these abnormalities to iron 
metabolism is not known, the fact that similar changes occur in other 
forms of iron overload suggests that iron is directly involved.

Cardiac  involvement  is  the  presenting  manifestation  in  ~15%  of 
symptomatic patients. The most common manifestation is congestive 
heart failure, which occurs in ~10% of young adults with the disease, 
especially  those  with  juvenile  hemochromatosis.  Symptoms  of  con-
gestive heart failure may develop suddenly, with rapid progression to 
death if untreated. The heart is diffusely enlarged. This may be misdi-
agnosed as idiopathic cardiomyopathy if other overt manifestations are 
absent. Cardiac arrhythmias include premature supraventricular beats, 
paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and vary-
ing degrees of atrioventricular block.

Hypogonadism occurs in both sexes and may antedate other clinical 
features. Manifestations include loss of libido, impotence, amenorrhea, 
testicular atrophy, gynecomastia, and sparse body hair. These changes 
are primarily the result of decreased production of gonadotropins due 
to impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary function by iron deposition.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The  association  of  (1)  hepatomegaly,  (2)  skin  pigmentation,  (3)  dia-
betes  mellitus,  (4)  heart  disease,  (5)  arthritis,  and  (6)  hypogonadism 
should suggest the diagnosis. However, as stated above, significant iron 
overload  may  exist  with  none  or  only  some  of  these  manifestations. 
Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis 
early.  Treatment  before  permanent  organ  damage  occurs  can  reverse 
the iron toxicity and restore life expectancy to normal.

The history should be particularly detailed in regard to disease in 
other  family  members  and  should  include  information  on  alcohol 
ingestion;  iron  intake;  and  ingestion  of  large  doses  of  ascorbic  acid, 
which promotes iron absorption (Chap. 333). Appropriate tests should 
be performed to exclude iron deposition due to hematologic disease. 
The presence of liver, pancreatic, cardiac, and joint disease should be 
confirmed  by  physical  examination,  radiography,  and  standard  func-
tion tests of these organs.

The degree of increase in total body iron stores can be assessed by 
(1) measurement of serum iron and the percent saturation of trans-
ferrin  (or  the  unsaturated  iron-binding  capacity),  (2)  measurement 
of  serum  ferritin  concentration,  (3)  liver  biopsy  with  measurement 
of  the  iron  concentration  and  calculation  of  the  hepatic  iron  index 
(Table 414-2), and (4) MRI of the liver. In addition, a retrospective 
assessment  of  body-iron  storage  is  also  provided  by  performing 
weekly phlebotomy and calculating the amount of iron removed before 
iron stores are exhausted (1 mL blood = ~0.5 mg iron).

Each of these methods for assessing iron stores has advantages and 
limitations. The serum iron level and percent saturation of transferrin 
are elevated early in the course, but their specificity is reduced by sig-
nificant false-positive and false-negative rates. For example, serum iron 
concentration may be increased in patients with alcoholic liver disease 
without iron overload; in this situation, however, the hepatic iron index 
is usually not increased as in hemochromatosis (Table 414-2). In oth-
erwise healthy persons, a fasting serum transferrin saturation >45% is 
abnormal and suggests homozygosity for hemochromatosis.

The serum ferritin concentration is usually a good index of body-
iron  stores,  whether  decreased  or  increased.  In  fact,  an  increase  of  
1 μg/L in serum ferritin level reflects an increase of ~8–10 mg in body 
stores.  In  most  untreated  patients  with  hemochromatosis,  the  serum

ferritin level is significantly increased (Fig. 414-2 and Table 414-2), and 
a serum ferritin level >1000 μg/L is the strongest predictor of disease 
expression  among  individuals  homozygous  for  the  C282Y  mutation. 
However,  in  patients  with  inflammation  and  hepatocellular  necrosis, 
serum ferritin levels may be elevated out of proportion to body iron 
stores due to increased release from tissues. Therefore, a repeat deter-
mination of serum ferritin should be carried out after acute hepatocel-
lular damage has subsided (e.g., in alcoholic liver disease). Ordinarily, 
the combined measurements of the percent transferrin saturation and 
serum  ferritin  level  provide  a  simple  and  reliable  screening  test  for 
hemochromatosis,  including  the  precirrhotic  phase  of  the  disease.  If 
either of these tests is abnormal, genetic testing for hemochromatosis 
should be performed (Fig. 414-3).

The role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis and management of hemo-
chromatosis has been reassessed as a result of the widespread availabil-
ity  of  genetic  testing  for  the  C282Y  mutation.  The  absence  of  severe 
fibrosis  can  be  accurately  predicted  in  most  patients  using  clinical 
and  biochemical  variables.  Thus,  there  is  virtually  no  risk  of  severe 
fibrosis in a C282Y homozygous subject with (1) serum ferritin level 
<1000 μg/L, (2) normal serum alanine aminotransferase values, (3) no 
hepatomegaly, and (4) no excess alcohol intake. However, it should be 
emphasized that liver biopsy is the only reliable method for establish-
ing or excluding the presence of hepatic cirrhosis, which is the critical 
factor determining prognosis and the risk of developing hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Biopsy also permits histochemical estimation of tissue iron 
and measurement of hepatic iron concentration. Increased density of 
the liver due to iron deposition can be demonstrated by CT or MRI, 
and  with  improved  technology,  MRI  has  become  more  accurate  in 
determining hepatic iron concentration.

 ■ SCREENING FOR HEMOCHROMATOSIS
When  the  diagnosis  of  hemochromatosis  is  established,  it  is  impor-
tant  to  counsel  and  screen  other  family  members  (Chap.  467). 

Asymptomatic  and  symptomatic  family  members  with  the  disease 
usually  have  an  increased  saturation  of  transferrin  and  an  increased 
serum  ferritin  concentration.  These  changes  occur  even  before  iron 
stores are greatly increased (Fig. 414-2). All adult first-degree relatives 
of  patients  with  hemochromatosis  should  be  tested  for  the  C282Y 
and  H63D  mutations  and  counseled  appropriately  (Fig.  414-3).  In 
affected individuals, it is important to confirm or exclude the presence 
of cirrhosis and begin therapy as early as possible. For children of an 
identified  proband,  testing  for  HFE  mutations  in  the  other  parent  is 
helpful because if normal, the child is merely an obligate heterozygote 
and at no risk. Otherwise, for practical purposes, children need not be 
checked before they are 18 years old.

The role of population screening for hemochromatosis is controver-
sial. Recent studies indicate that it is highly effective for primary care 
physicians  to  screen  subjects  using  transferrin  saturation  and  serum 
ferritin  levels.  Such  screening  also  detects  iron  deficiency.  Genetic 
screening of the normal population is feasible but remains controver-
sial in terms of cost-effectiveness.

TREATMENT
Hemochromatosis

The  therapy  of  hemochromatosis  involves  removal  of  the  excess 
body  iron  and  supportive  treatment  of  damaged  organs.  Iron 
removal is best accomplished by weekly or, with gross iron loading, 
twice-weekly  phlebotomy  of  500  mL.  Although  there  is  an  initial 
modest decline in the volume of packed red blood cells to about 35 
mL/dL, the level stabilizes after several weeks. The plasma transfer-
rin saturation remains increased until the available iron stores are 
depleted.  In  contrast,  the  plasma  ferritin  concentration  falls  pro-
gressively, reflecting the gradual decrease in body-iron stores. One 
500-mL unit of blood contains 200–250 mg of iron, and ≥25 g of 
iron may have to be removed. Therefore, in patients with advanced 
disease, weekly phlebotomy may be required for 1–2 years, and it 
should  be  continued  until  the  serum  ferritin  level  is  ≤100  μg/L. 
Thereafter,  phlebotomies  are  performed  at  appropriate  intervals 
to maintain ferritin levels at ≤100 μg/L. The transferrin saturation 
fluctuates and may still be elevated but should not dictate further 
therapy  unless  it  is  persistently  at  100%  when  free  unbound  iron 
may circulate. Usually one phlebotomy every 3 months will suffice. 
It  is  important,  however,  not  to  overtreat  and  render  the  patient 
iron deficient.

Chelating agents such as deferoxamine, when given parenterally, 
remove  10–20  mg  of  iron  per  day,  which  is  much  less  than  that 
mobilized  by  once-weekly  phlebotomy.  Phlebotomy  is  also  less 
expensive, more convenient, and safer for most patients. However, 
chelating agents are indicated when anemia or hypoproteinemia is 
severe  enough  to  preclude  phlebotomy.  Subcutaneous  infusion  of 
deferoxamine using a portable pump is the most effective means of 
its administration.

Effective  oral  iron  chelating  agents,  deferasirox  (Exjade)  and 
deferiprone, are now available. These agents are effective in thalas-
semia and secondary iron overload, but are expensive and carry the 
risk of significant side effects.

Alcohol consumption should be severely curtailed or eliminated 
because it increases the risk of cirrhosis in hereditary hemochroma-
tosis nearly tenfold. Dietary adjustments are unnecessary, although 
vitamin C and iron supplements should be avoided. The manage-
ment  of  hepatic  failure,  cardiac  failure,  and  diabetes  mellitus  is 
similar to conventional therapy for these conditions. Loss of libido 
and change in secondary sex characteristics are managed with tes-
tosterone replacement or gonadotropin therapy (Chap. 391).

End-stage  liver  disease  may  be  an  indication  for  liver  trans-
plantation, although results are improved if the excess iron can be 
removed beforehand. The available evidence indicates that the fun-
damental metabolic abnormality in hemochromatosis is reversed by 
successful liver transplantation.

 ■ PROGNOSIS
The principal causes of death are cardiac failure, hepatocellular failure, 
or portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Life expectancy is improved by removal of excessive iron stores and 
maintenance of these stores at near-normal levels. The 5-year survival 
rate with therapy increases from 33% to 89%. With repeated phlebot-
omy,  the  liver  decreases  in  size,  liver  function  improves,  pigmenta-
tion  of  skin  decreases,  and  cardiac  failure  may  be  reversed.  Diabetes 
improves in ~40% of patients, but removal of excess iron has little effect 
on  hypogonadism  or  arthropathy.  Hepatic  fibrosis  may  decrease,  but 
established cirrhosis is irreversible. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs as 
a late sequela in patients who are cirrhotic at presentation. The apparent 
increase in its incidence in treated patients is probably related to their 
increased  life  span.  Hepatocellular  carcinoma  rarely  develops  if  the 
disease is treated in the precirrhotic stage. Indeed, the life expectancy 
of homozygotes treated before the development of cirrhosis is normal.
The importance of family screening and early diagnosis and treat-
ment  cannot  be  overemphasized.  Asymptomatic  individuals  detected 
by  family  studies  should  have  phlebotomy  therapy  if  iron  stores  are 
moderately to severely increased. Assessment of iron stores at appro-
priate  intervals  is  also  important.  With  this  management  approach, 
most manifestations of the disease can be prevented.

 ■ ROLE OF HFE MUTATIONS IN OTHER  
LIVER DISEASES

There is considerable interest in the role of HFE mutations and 
hepatic  iron  in  several  other  liver  diseases.  Several  studies  have 
shown  an  increased  prevalence  of  HFE  mutations  in  PCT 
patients. Iron accentuates the inherited enzyme deficiency in PCT and 
clinical manifestations of PCT. The situation in NASH is less clear, but 
some studies have shown an increased prevalence of HFE mutations in 
NASH patients. The role of phlebotomy therapy, however, is unproven 
despite an intriguing fall in liver enzyme levels. In chronic HCV infec-
tion,  HFE  mutations  are  not  more  common,  but  some  subjects  have 
increased  hepatic  iron.  Before  initiating  antiviral  therapy  in  these 
patients,  it  is  reasonable  to  perform  phlebotomy  therapy  to  remove 
excess iron stores, because this reduces liver enzyme levels.

HFE mutations are not increased in frequency in alcoholic liver dis-
ease. Hemochromatosis in a heavy drinker can be distinguished from 
alcoholic liver disease by the presence of the C282Y mutation.

End-stage  liver  disease  may  also  be  associated  with  iron  overload 
of the degree seen in hemochromatosis. The mechanism is uncertain, 
although studies have shown that alcohol suppresses hepatic hepcidin 
secretion. Hemolysis also plays a role. HFE mutations are uncommon.
Whether  subjects  homozygous  for  C282Y  are  at  increased  risk  of 

breast and colorectal cancer is controversial.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
The HFE mutation is of northern European origin (Celtic or Nordic) 
with a heterozygous carrier rate of ~1 in 10 (1 in 8 in Ireland). Thus, 
HFE-associated hemochromatosis is quite rare in non-European pop-
ulations,  e.g.,  Asia.  However,  non-HFE-associated  hemochromatosis 
resulting from mutations in other genes involved in iron metabolism 
(Fig. 414-1) is ubiquitous and should be considered when one encoun-
ters iron overload.

African iron overload occurs primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and 
was previously thought to be due to the consumption of an iron-rich 
fermented maize beverage. However, recent evidence suggests that it is 
primarily the result of a non-HFE-related genetic trait that is exacer-
bated by dietary iron loading. A similar form of iron overload has been 
described in African Americans. Further research is needed to clarify 
this condition.

415 Wilson’s Disease

Stephen G. Kaler

Wilson’s  disease  is  an  inherited  human  disorder  of  copper  transport 
that  primarily  impacts  the  liver  and  brain.  This  reflects  the  critical 
need for homeostatic mechanisms to properly utilize this trace metal, 
both systemically and in the central nervous system. Since the initial 
detailed clinical description in 1912, Wilson’s disease has emerged as 
arguably one of the best-characterized and most effectively managed 
human inborn errors of metabolism. The condition results from vari-
ants  in  ATP7B,  a  highly  evolutionarily  conserved  P-type  ion-motive 
ATPase that normally mediates copper ion removal from the liver via 
biliary  excretion  and  prevents  brain  copper  accumulation.  Prompt 
diagnosis in the early symptomatic phase of the illness (or presymp-
tomatic detection) and lifelong treatment are needed to avoid prema-
ture mortality in affected individuals.

HISTORY OF WILSON’S DISEASE
Wilson’s  disease  (hepatolenticular  degeneration)  was  first  described  in 
1912 by neurologist S.A.K. Wilson, who recognized the inherited aspect 
of  the  condition.  In  1948,  the  pathologist  J.N.  Cumings  proposed  an 
etiologic  connection  with  copper  overload.  Several  years  later,  a  metal 
chelator  developed  to  counteract  an  arsenic-based  chemical  warfare 
agent (lewisite) was used to successfully treat advanced Wilson’s disease. 
In 1956, copper chelation by d-penicillamine was introduced and found 
preferable to anti-lewisite with respect to administration and side effect 
profile. In the early 1970s, an alternative copper chelator, triethylene tetra-
mine, became the second U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–
approved  treatment  for  Wilson’s  disease.  Also  in  the  early  1970s,  the 
first liver transplants were performed for Wilson’s disease, with resultant 
correction of both hepatic failure and crippling neurologic impairments 
in patients unresponsive to medical therapies. The treatment potential of 
zinc salts to reduce gastrointestinal copper absorption in Wilson’s disease 
was  recognized  in  the  early  1960s,  eventually  leading  to  FDA  approval 
for this indication. Tetrathiomolybdate, which forms a tripartite complex 
with copper and albumin, and a bacterial peptide, methanobactin, which 
traverses mitochondrial membranes, are more recently proposed copper 
chelators with potential for treatment of Wilson’s disease.

In 1993, the gene for Wilson’s disease was identified and found to 
encode  a  copper-transporting  ATPase,  ATP7B,  expressed  primarily 
in  liver  and  kidney.  In  addition  to  providing  a  molecular  basis  for 
diagnosis  and  genotype-phenotype  correlations,  the  finding  presents 
current opportunities for viral gene therapy that could impact future 
management of this illness.

PHENOTYPES
 ■ CLINICAL
Presenting  clinical  features  of  Wilson’s  disease  include  nonspecific 
liver  disease,  neurologic  abnormalities,  psychiatric  illness,  hemolytic 
anemia, renal tubular Fanconi syndrome, and various skeletal abnor-
malities.  Age  influences  the  specific  presentation  in  Wilson’s  disease. 
Nearly all individuals who present with liver disease are <30 years of 
age, whereas those presenting with neurologic or psychiatric signs may 
range in age from the first to the fifth decade. This reflects the sequence 
of  events  in  the  pathogenesis  of  the  illness.  However,  regardless  of 
clinical presentation, some degree of liver disease is invariably present.
Hepatic  Presentation  With  hepatic  presentations,  signs  and 
symptoms  include  jaundice,  hepatomegaly,  edema,  or  ascites.  Viral 
hepatitis  and  cirrhosis  are  often  initial  diagnostic  considerations  in 
individuals who, in fact, have Wilson’s disease.
Neurologic  Presentation 
In  patients  with  neurologic  presenta-
tions,  abnormalities  include  speech  difficulty  (dysarthria),  dystonia, 
rigidity, tremor or choreiform movements, abnormal gait, and uncoor-
dinated handwriting. Wilson’s disease may be classified as a movement

hepatic  transaminase  levels,  aminoaciduria,  and  hemolytic  anemia. 
Incorporation  of  radiolabeled  64Cu  into  serum  ceruloplasmin,  mea-
sured as the appearance of copper in the serum after an oral load, is a 
highly specific diagnostic test; patients with Wilson’s disease incorpo-
rate very little 64Cu into ceruloplasmin.

Increased  urinary  excretion  of  copper  (>100  μg/24  h)  is  an  eas-
ily  performed  and  important  diagnostic  test  for  Wilson’s  disease. 
Acid-washed  (copper-free)  collection  containers  should  be  used. 
The  penicillamine  challenge  is  a  variation  using  serial  urine  copper 
measurements  in  which  500  mg  of  penicillamine  are  administered 
orally after collecting a baseline 24-h urine. The penicillamine dose is 
repeated after 12 h, the midpoint of the second 24-h urine collection. 
A severalfold increase in copper excretion in the second collection is 
suggestive of the diagnosis.

Although  invasive,  percutaneous  needle  liver  biopsy  for  measure-
ment of hepatic copper remains a gold standard technique for Wilson’s 
disease  diagnosis.  Hepatic  copper  values  >200  μg  per  gram  of  dry 
weight (normal 20–50 μg) are characteristic of Wilson’s disease. Induc-
tively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and atomic absorption spec-
trometry  are  preferred  quantitative  methods;  histochemical  staining 
for copper in liver biopsy specimens is unreliable.
 ■ MOLECULAR
Wilson’s  disease  is  caused  by  loss-of-function  variants  in  ATP7B. 
Despite  similar  genomic  structures,  large  deletions  are  much  less 
common in ATP7B than in ATP7A, the closely related X-linked gene 
responsible for Menkes disease. Several ATP7B missense variants are 
common (H1069Q, M645R, and R778L), with various allelic frequen-
cies  reflecting  geographic,  racial,  and/or  ethnic  differences.  Major 
ATP7B  databases  list  >650  pathogenic  or  likely  pathogenic  variants. 
Population-based  and  genomic-based  estimates  of  prevalence  range 
from 1 in 7000 to 1 in 30,000, with genome-based ascertainments sup-
porting  the  higher  prevalence.  This  disparity  may  reflect  incomplete 
penetrance, although there is little doubt that some affected individuals 
unfortunately escape medical attention.
DIAGNOSIS
The  formal  diagnosis  of  Wilson’s  disease  relies  on  a  combination  of 
clinical, biochemical, and molecular features (Table 415-1). A scoring 
system (Leipzig) that weights and collates various signs and symptoms 
was produced by an international expert group in 2001 and remains a 
valuable guide to diagnosis endorsed by the European Association for 
the Study of the Liver (EASL).

TREATMENT
Wilson’s Disease

COPPER CHELATION
The  era  of  successful  treatment  of  Wilson’s  disease  began  with 
the  use  of  British  anti-lewisite  (BAL)  by  a  defined  regimen  of 
intramuscular  injections.  An  orally  administered  alternative  was 
d-penicillamine  (Cuprimine),  a  free  thiol  that  binds  copper.  This 
chelating drug does not formally correct the basic defect of impaired 
copper excretion in the bile. However, it greatly enhances urinary 
excretion of copper and thereby corrects and prevents copper over-
load  and  its  effects.  Pyridoxine  (vitamin  B6)  is  usually  prescribed 
concomitantly to counter the tendency for deficiency of this vita-
min to develop during chronic penicillamine administration.

Certain  individuals  are  intolerant  of  penicillamine,  however, 
encountering  significant  side  effects  that  include  nephrotoxicity, 
hematologic abnormalities, and a distinctive rash, elastosis perforans 
serpiginosa (usually involving the neck and axillae). Furthermore, in 
some Wilson’s disease patients with neurologic presentations, pen-
icillamine treatment induces paradoxical worsening of neurologic 
status. Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (trientine hydrochlo-
ride [Syprine]) is a suitable alternative chelating agent with a some-
what less extensive side effect profile.

Tetrathiomolybdate  (TM)  is  another  molecule  in  the  Wilson’s 
disease  therapeutic  armamentarium.  TM  forms  stable  tripartite

disorder. The neurologic signs and symptoms reflect the predilection 
for basal ganglia (e.g., caudate, putamen) involvement in the brains of 
affected persons. Parkinson disease or other movement disorders may 
be mistakenly diagnosed.

Psychiatric  Presentation 
In  psychiatric  presentations,  changes 
in  personality  (irritability,  anger,  poor  self-control),  depression,  and 
anxiety are common symptoms. Typically, patients presenting in this 
fashion are in their late teens or early twenties, a period during which 
substance  abuse  is  also  a  diagnostic  consideration.  Wilson’s  disease 
should  be  formally  excluded  in  all  teenagers  and  young  adults  with 
new-onset psychiatric signs.

Ocular  Manifestations  The  eye  is  a  primary  site  of  copper 
deposition in Wilson’s disease, producing a pathognomonic sign, the 
Kayser-Fleischer ring (Fig. 415-1), a golden to greenish-brown band in 
the peripheral cornea. This important diagnostic sign first appears as a 
superior crescent and then develops inferiorly and ultimately becomes 
circumferential.  Slit-lamp  or  optical  coherent  tomography  examina-
tions  are  required  to  detect  rings  in  their  early  stage  of  formation. 
Copper can also accumulate in the lens and produce “sunflower” cata-
racts. Approximately 95% of Wilson’s disease patients with neurologic 
signs  manifest  the  Kayser-Fleischer  ring  compared  to  ~65%  of  those 
with hepatic presentations. Copper chelation therapy causes fading and 
eventual disappearance of corneal copper.

Other  Clinical  Manifestations  Secondary  endocrine  effects  of 
Wilson-associated liver disease may include delayed puberty or amen-
orrhea. Renal tubular dysfunction in Wilson’s disease leads to abnormal 
losses  of  amino  acids,  electrolytes,  calcium,  phosphorus,  and  glucose. 
Presumably, this effect is related to copper toxicity. High copper levels 
have  been  noted  previously  in  the  kidneys  of  patients  with  Wilson’s 
disease. Treatment with copper chelation often improves the renal dis-
turbances. There can also be skeletal effects of Wilson’s disease, including 
osteoporosis and rickets, and these may be attributable to renal losses of 
calcium and phosphorus. Osteoarthritis primarily affecting the knees and 
wrists may involve excess copper deposition in the bone and cartilage.

Hemolytic anemia due to the direct toxic effects of copper on red 
blood  cell  membranes  is  usually  associated  with  release  of  massive 
quantities of hepatic copper into the circulation, a phenomenon that 
can be sudden and catastrophic.
 ■ BIOCHEMICAL
Laboratory  findings  that  support  the  diagnosis  of  Wilson’s  disease 
include low levels of serum copper and serum ceruloplasmin, elevated

complexes among albumin, copper, and itself. This drug functions 
both to decrease copper absorption and to reduce circulating free 
copper.  It  is  fast  acting  and  can  restore  normal  copper  balance 
within  several  weeks  compared  to  the  several  months  required 
with other copper chelators or with zinc. This drug is the subject of 
recent clinical trials and may one day be an approved treatment for 
advanced breast cancer as well as Wilson’s disease. 
Copper Chelation Treatment During Pregnancy  Spontaneous mis-
carriage  is  increased  in  women  with  untreated  Wilson’s  disease. 
From a benefit/risk perspective, it is important to maintain copper 
chelation  treatment  during  pregnancy  to  prevent  hepatic  or  neu-
rologic  relapse,  as  well  as  to  lower  risk  of  pregnancy  loss.  Some 
academic  centers  favor  copper  chelator  dose  reduction  during 
pregnancy,  although  if  zinc  monotherapy  (see  below)  is  in  place 
at the time of conception, evidence suggests it is safe to maintain 
the usual daily dose. Since all anticopper medications enter breast 
milk, breast-feeding is not recommended for mothers with Wilson’s 
disease. 
REDUCTION OF COPPER ABSORPTION
Zinc  acetate  (Galzin)  has  proven  highly  effective  for  treatment 
of  Wilson’s  disease.  The  mechanism  involves  induction  of  metal-
lothionein  synthesis  in  intestinal  epithelial  cells;  increased  metal-
lothionein  synthesis  results  in  greater  binding  of  dietary  copper 
and thus decreased absorption. Zinc therapy has particular value in 
(1) young, presymptomatic patients; (2) patients who are pregnant, 
given  the  possible  fetal  teratogenic  effects  of  other  compounds; 
and  (3)  as  maintenance  therapy  for  patients  after  their  initial   
“de-coppering”  is  accomplished.  Zinc  acetate  has  minimal  side 
effects.  The  only  drawback  to  its  use  is  the  relatively  long  time   
(4–6  months)  needed  for  restoration  of  proper  copper  balance 
when used as monotherapy in the initial stages of treatment. 
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
Liver  transplantation  is  a  consideration  for  Wilson’s  disease  in 
advanced  stages  and/or  when  the  condition  is  unresponsive  to

medical  therapy.  This  is  generally  necessary  only  in  cases  where 
delayed diagnosis or poor compliance results in irreversible hepatic 
damage.  A  recently  proposed  alternative  for  this  circumstance  is 
methanobactin,  a  bacterial  peptide  that  binds  copper  avidly  and 
dramatically improves mitochondrial copper overload and restores 
normal mitochondrial morphology in a preclinical (rat) model. 
GENE THERAPY
In a different preclinical (mouse) model of Wilson, proof of princi-
ple that adeno-associated virus-mediated ATP7B addition to hepa-
tocytes  can  be  effective  was  recently  demonstrated.  Transduction 
of  only  20%  of  hepatocytes  was  sufficient  to  normalize  copper 
homeostasis in the animal model. These results potentially pave the 
way for clinical trials of gene therapy in Wilson’s disease patients.

FUTURE OUTLOOK
Wilson’s  disease  is  arguably  one  of  the  best-characterized  human 
inborn  errors  of  metabolism  from  combined  clinical,  biochemical, 
and  molecular  perspectives,  related  to  the  detailed  attention  devoted 
to this condition. As noted, novel copper chelators are still being eval-
uated, and generic formulations of established drugs are contributing 
to  increased  affordability  for  patients  and  their  families.  Viral  gene 
therapy to provide working versions of ATP7B to the liver, kidney, and 
brain or that delivers gene-editing molecules to correct specific mutant 
alleles is now an emerging prospect. In addition, advances in newborn 
screening  technology  may  eventually  enable  wider  population-based 
screening  for  Wilson’s  disease,  which  could  help  address  lingering 
questions about clinical penetrance. Such future progress in newborn 
screening  would  also  avert  the  tragedy  that  missed  diagnoses  of  this 
eminently treatable disorder of copper transport represent.

416 The Porphyrias

Robert J. Desnick, Manisha Balwani

THE PORPHYRIAS: INTRODUCTION
The  porphyrias  are  metabolic  disorders,  each  resulting  from  the 
deficiency  or  increased  activity  of  a  specific  enzyme  in  the  heme 
biosynthetic  pathway  (Fig.  416-1  and  Table  416-1).  These  enzyme 
disorders are inherited as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or 
X-linked traits, with the exception of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), 
which is usually sporadic (Table 416-1). The porphyrias are classified 
as  either  hepatic  or  erythropoietic,  depending  on  the  primary  site  of

overproduction  and  accumulation  of  their  respective  porphyrin  pre-
cursors or porphyrins (Tables 416-1 and 416-2), although some have 
overlapping features. For example, PCT, the most common porphyria, 
is  hepatic  and  presents  with  blistering  cutaneous  photosensitivity, 
which is typically characteristic of the erythropoietic porphyrias.

The  major  manifestations  of  the  acute  hepatic  porphyrias  are 
neurologic,  including  neuropathic  abdominal  pain,  peripheral  motor 
neuropathy,  and  mental  disturbances,  with  attacks  often  precipitated 
by  dieting,  certain  porphyrinogenic  drugs,  and  hormonal  changes. 
While  hepatic  porphyrias  are  symptomatic  primarily  in  adults,  rare 
homozygous  variants  of  the  autosomal  dominant  hepatic  porphyrias 
usually  manifest  clinically  prior  to  puberty.  In  contrast,  the  erythro-
poietic porphyrias usually present at birth or in early childhood with 
cutaneous photosensitivity or, in the case of congenital erythropoietic 
porphyria (CEP), even in utero as nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Cutane-
ous sensitivity to sunlight results from excitation of excess porphyrins 
in the skin by long-wave ultraviolet light, leading to cell damage, scar-
ring, and disfigurement. Thus, the porphyrias are metabolic disorders 
in  which  environmental,  physiologic,  and  genetic  factors  interact  to 
cause disease.

Because many symptoms of the porphyrias are nonspecific, diagno-
sis is often delayed. Laboratory measurement of porphyrin precursors 
(5′-aminolevulinic  acid  [ALA]  and  porphobilinogen  [PBG])  in  the 
urine  or  porphyrins  in  the  urine,  plasma,  erythrocytes,  or  feces  is 
required  to  confirm  or  exclude  the  various  types  of  porphyria  (see 
below).  However,  a  definite  diagnosis  requires  demonstration  of  the 
specific  gene  defect  (Table  416-3).  The  genes  encoding  all  the  heme 
biosynthetic  enzymes  have  been  characterized,  permitting  identifica-
tion of the mutations causing each porphyria (Table 416-2). Molecular 
genetic analyses now make it possible to provide precise heterozygote 
or homozygote identification and prenatal diagnoses in families with 
known mutations.

In  addition  to  recent  reviews  of  the  porphyrias,  informative  and 
up-to-date websites are sponsored by the American Porphyria Foun-
dation  (www.porphyriafoundation.com)  and  the  European  Porphyria 
Network  (https://porphyria.eu/).  An  extensive  list  of  unsafe  and  safe 
drugs  for  individuals  with  acute  porphyrias  is  provided  at  the  Drug 
Database for Acute Porphyrias (www.drugs-porphyria.org).

GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
The porphyrias are panethnic metabolic diseases that affect individuals 
around  the  globe.  The  acute  hepatic  porphyrias—acute  intermittent 
porphyria  (AIP),  hereditary  coproporphyria  (HCP),  and  variegate 
porphyria  (VP)—are  autosomal  dominant  disorders.  The  frequency 
of symptomatic AIP, the most common acute hepatic porphyria, is ~1 
in 20,000 among Caucasian individuals of Western European ancestry, 
and it is particularly frequent in Scandinavians, with a frequency of ~1 
in  10,000  in  Sweden.  However,  recent  studies  using  genomic/exomic 
databases showed an estimated frequency of pathogenic variants in the 
HMBS gene as ~1 in 1700. Thus, the penetrance of AIP, and likely the 
other acute hepatic porphyrias, is low, with ~1% of those with patho-
genic mutations experiencing acute attacks (see below).

VP  is  particularly  frequent  in  South  Africa,  where  its  high  preva-
lence (>10,000 affected patients) is in part due to a genetic “founder 
effect.”  The  autosomal  recessive  acute  hepatic  porphyria,  ALA-dehy-
dratase-deficient porphyria (ADP), is very rare, and <20 patients have 
been reported worldwide.

The  erythropoietic  porphyrias—CEP,  erythropoietic  protoporphy-
ria  (EPP),  and  X-linked  protoporphyria  (XLP)—also  are  panethnic. 
EPP is the most common porphyria in children, whereas CEP is very 
rare, with ~200 reported cases worldwide. The frequency of EPP var-
ies  globally  because  most  patients  have  the  common  low  expression 
ferrochelatase  (FECH)  mutation  that  varies  in  frequency  in  different 
populations.  The  allele  rarely  occurs  in  Africans,  is  present  in  ~10% 
of whites, and is frequent (~30%) in the Japanese. The reported prev-
alence of EPP in the Caucasian population ranges from 1 in ~75,000 
to 1 in ~150,000.

The  autosomal  recessive  porphyrias—ADP,  CEP,  and  hepatoery-
thropoietic porphyria (HEP)—are more frequent in regions with high 
rates  of  consanguineous  unions.  PCT,  which  is  typically  sporadic, 
occurs  more  frequently  in  countries  in  which  its  predisposing  risk 
factors such as hepatitis C and HIV are more prevalent.
 ■ HEME BIOSYNTHESIS
Heme  biosynthesis  involves  eight  enzymatic  steps  in  the  conversion 
of  glycine  and  succinyl-CoA  to  heme  (Fig.  416-2  and  Table  416-2). 
These eight enzymes are encoded by nine genes, as the first enzyme in

the pathway, ALA-synthase, has two genes that encode unique house-
keeping (ALAS1)  and  erythroid-specific  (ALAS2)  isozymes.  The  first 
and  last  three  enzymes  in  the  pathway  are  located  in  the  mitochon-
dria, whereas the other four are in the cytosol. Heme is required for a 
variety  of  hemoproteins  such  as  hemoglobin,  myoglobin,  respiratory 
cytochromes, and the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Hemoglobin 
synthesis in erythroid precursor cells accounts for ~85% of daily heme 
synthesis in humans. Hepatocytes account for most of the rest, primar-
ily for the synthesis of CYPs, which are especially abundant in the liver 
endoplasmic reticulum, and turn over more rapidly than many other 
hemoproteins, such as the mitochondrial respiratory cytochromes. As 
shown in Fig. 416-2, the pathway intermediates are the porphyrin pre-
cursors, ALA and PBG, and porphyrins (mostly in their reduced forms, 
known as porphyrinogens). At least in humans, these intermediates do 
not  accumulate  in  significant  amounts  under  normal  conditions  or 
have important physiologic functions.

The  first  enzyme,  ALA-synthase,  catalyzes  the  condensation  of 
glycine,  activated  by  pyridoxal  phosphate  and  succinyl-coenzyme  A, 
to  form  ALA.  In  the  liver,  this  rate-limiting  enzyme  can  be  induced 
by a variety of drugs, steroids, and other chemicals. Distinct nonery-
throid (e.g., housekeeping) and erythroid-specific forms of ALA-syn-
thase are encoded by separate genes located on chromosome 3p21.1 
(ALAS1)  and  Xp11.2  (ALAS2),  respectively.  Defects  in  the  erythroid 
gene ALAS2 that decrease its activity cause an X-linked sideroblastic 
anemia (XLSA). Gain-of-function mutations in the last exon (11) of 

ALAS2 that increase its activity cause an X-linked form of EPP, known 
as XLP.

The second enzyme, ALA-dehydratase, catalyzes the condensation 
of two molecules of ALA to form PBG. Hydroxymethylbilane synthase 
(HMB-synthase;  also  known  as  PBG-deaminase)  catalyzes  the  head-
to-tail condensation of four PBG molecules by a series of deaminations 
to form the linear tetrapyrrole, HMB. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase 
(URO-synthase) catalyzes the rearrangement and rapid cyclization of 
HMB to form the asymmetric, physiologic, octacarboxylate porphyrin-
ogen, uroporphyrinogen (URO’gen) III.

The fifth enzyme in the pathway, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase 
(URO-decarboxylase), catalyzes the sequential removal of the four car-
boxyl groups from the acetic acid side chains of URO’gen III to form 
coproporphyrinogen  (COPRO’gen)  III,  a  tetracarboxylate  porphyrin-
ogen.  This  compound  then  enters  the  mitochondrion  via  a  specific 
transporter,  where  COPRO-oxidase,  the  sixth  enzyme,  catalyzes  the 
decarboxylation of two of the four propionic acid groups to form the 
two  vinyl  groups  of  protoporphyrinogen  (PROTO’gen)  IX,  a  decar-
boxylate  porphyrinogen.  Next,  PROTO-oxidase  oxidizes  PROTO’gen 
to  protoporphyrin  IX  by  the  removal  of  six  hydrogen  atoms.  The 
product of the reaction is a porphyrin (oxidized form), in contrast to 
the  preceding  tetrapyrrole  intermediates,  which  are  porphyrinogens 
(reduced forms). Finally, ferrous iron is inserted into protoporphyrin 
IX to form heme, a reaction catalyzed by the eighth enzyme in the path-
way, FECH (also known as heme synthase or protoheme ferrolyase).

FIGURE 416-2  The heme biosynthetic pathway showing the eight enzymes and their substrates and products. Four of the enzymes are localized in the mitochondria and 
four in the cytosol.

 ■ REGULATION OF HEME BIOSYNTHESIS
Regulation of heme synthesis differs in the two major heme-forming 
tissues, the liver and erythron. In the liver, the concentration of “free” 
heme regulates the synthesis and mitochondrial translocation of the 
housekeeping form of ALA-synthase 1. Heme represses the synthesis 
of the ALA-synthase 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and interferes with 
the  transport  of  the  enzyme  from  the  cytosol  into  mitochondria. 
Hepatic ALA-synthase 1 is increased by many of the same chemicals 
that  induce  the  CYP  enzymes  in  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  of  the 
liver. Because most of the heme in the liver is used for the synthesis of 
CYP enzymes, hepatic ALA-synthase 1 and the CYPs are regulated in 
a coordinated fashion, and many drugs that induce hepatic ALA-syn-
thase  1  also  induce  CYP  gene  expression.  The  other  hepatic  heme 

biosynthetic  enzymes  are  presumably  expressed  at  constant  levels, 
although  their  relative  activities  and  kinetic  properties  differ.  For 
example, normal individuals have high activities of ALA-dehydratase 
but  low  activities  of  HMB-synthase,  the  latter  being  the  second 
rate-limiting step in the pathway.

In the erythron, novel regulatory mechanisms allow for the produc-
tion of the very large amounts of heme needed for hemoglobin synthesis. 
The  response  to  stimuli  for  hemoglobin  synthesis  occurs  during  cell 
differentiation, leading to an increase in cell number. In contrast, the 
erythroid-specific  ALA-synthase  2  is  expressed  at  higher  levels  than 
the housekeeping enzyme, and erythroid-specific control mechanisms 
regulate other pathway enzymes as well as iron transport into erythroid 
cells. Separate erythroid-specific and nonerythroid or “housekeeping”

3242 transcripts  are  known  for  the  first  four  enzymes  in  the  pathway.  As 
noted  above,  housekeeping-  and  erythroid-specific  ALA-synthases 
are encoded by genes on different chromosomes, but for each of the 
next  three  genes  in  the  pathway,  both  erythroid  and  nonerythroid 
transcripts are transcribed by alternative promoters from their single 
respective genes (Table 416-2).
 ■ CLASSIFICATION OF THE PORPHYRIAS
As mentioned above, the porphyrias can be classified as either hepatic 
or erythropoietic, depending on whether the heme biosynthetic inter-
mediates  that  accumulate  arise  initially  from  the  liver  or  developing 
erythrocytes, or as acute or cutaneous, based on their clinical manifes-
tations. Table 416-1 lists the porphyrias, their principal symptoms, and 
major biochemical abnormalities. Three of the five hepatic porphyrias—
AIP, HCP, and VP—usually present during adult life with acute attacks 
of neurologic manifestations and elevated levels of one or both of the 
porphyrin precursors, ALA and PBG, and are thus classified as acute 
hepatic porphyrias. Patients with ADP have presented in infancy and 
adolescence and typically have elevated ALA with normal or slightly 
elevated  PBG  levels.  The  fifth  hepatic  disorder,  PCT,  presents  with 
blistering skin lesions. HCP and VP also may have cutaneous manifes-
tations similar to PCT.

The  erythropoietic  porphyrias—CEP,  EPP,  and  XLP—are  charac-
terized by elevations of porphyrins in bone marrow and erythrocytes 
and present with cutaneous photosensitivity. The skin lesions in CEP 
resemble  PCT  but  are  usually  much  more  severe,  whereas  EPP  and 
XLP cause a more immediate, severe, painful, and nonblistering type 
of  photosensitivity.  EPP  is  the  most  common  porphyria  to  cause 
symptoms before puberty. About 20% of EPP patients develop minor 
abnormalities  of  liver  function,  with  up  to  ~5%  developing  hepatic 
complications that can lead to liver failure requiring liver transplanta-
tion. XLP has a clinical presentation similar to EPP causing photosen-
sitivity and liver disease.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS OF PORPHYRIA
A  few  specific  and  sensitive  first-line  laboratory  tests  should  be 
used whenever symptoms or signs suggest the diagnosis of porphyria 
(Table 416-3). If a first-line test is significantly abnormal, more com-
prehensive  testing  should  follow  to  establish  the  type  of  porphyria, 
including the specific causative gene mutation.

Acute  Hepatic  Porphyrias  An  acute  hepatic  porphyria  should 
be  suspected  in  patients  with  neurovisceral  symptoms  after  puberty. 
Symptoms  include  acute  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  vomiting,  tachy-
cardia,  hypertension,  and  motor  neuropathy.  As  these  symptoms  are 
common, other causes should be ruled out. The diagnosis is made by 
measuring  urinary  porphyrin  precursors  (ALA  and  PBG)  in  a  spot 
sample of urine (Fig. 416-2). Urinary PBG is always increased during 
acute attacks of AIP, HCP, and VP and is not substantially increased 
in any other medical condition. Therefore, this measurement is both 
sensitive and specific. Results from spot (single-void) urine specimens 
are  highly  informative  because  very  substantial  increases  in  PBG  are 
expected during acute attacks of porphyria. A 24-h collection is unnec-
essary. The same spot urine specimen should be saved for quantitative 
determination of ALA, PBG, and creatinine, in order to confirm the 
qualitative  PBG  result  and  also  to  detect  patients  with  ADP.  Urinary 
porphyrins  may  remain  increased  longer  than  porphyrin  precursors 
in HCP and VP. Therefore, it is useful to measure total urinary por-
phyrins in the same sample, keeping in mind that urinary porphyrin 
increases  are  often  nonspecific.  Measurement  of  urinary  porphyrins 
alone should be avoided for screening, because these may be increased 
in disorders other than porphyrias, such as chronic liver disease, and 
misdiagnoses of porphyria can result from minimal increases in uri-
nary porphyrins that have no diagnostic significance. Measurement of 
erythrocyte HMB-synthase is not useful as a first-line test. Moreover, 
the enzyme activity is not decreased in all AIP patients, a borderline 
low normal value is not diagnostic, and the enzyme is not deficient in 
other acute porphyrias.

More  extensive  testing  is  justified  when  an  initial  test  is  positive. 
A substantial increase in PBG may be due to AIP, HCP, or VP. These 

acute porphyrias can be distinguished by measuring urinary porphy-
rins (using the same spot urine sample), fecal porphyrins, and plasma 
porphyrins.  Assays  for  COPRO-oxidase  or  PROTO-oxidase  are  not 
available  for  clinical  testing.  More  specifically,  mutation  analysis  by 
sequencing  the  genes  encoding  HMB-synthase,  COPRO-oxidase, 
and PROTO-oxidase will detect almost all disease-causing mutations 
and is diagnostic even when the levels of urinary ALA and PBG have 
returned to normal or near normal.

Cutaneous  Porphyrias  Blistering  skin  lesions  due  to  porphyria 
are  virtually  always  accompanied  by  increases  in  total  plasma  por-
phyrins.  A  fluorometric  method  is  preferred,  because  the  plasma 
porphyrins in VP are mostly covalently linked to plasma proteins and 
may  be  less  readily  detected  by  high-performance  liquid  chromatog-
raphy (HPLC). The normal range for plasma porphyrins is somewhat 
increased in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Although a total plasma porphyrin determination will usually detect 
EPP  and  XLP,  an  erythrocyte  protoporphyrin  determination  is  more 
sensitive.  Increases  in  erythrocyte  protoporphyrin  occur  in  many 
other conditions. Therefore, the diagnosis of EPP must be confirmed 
by  showing  a  predominant  increase  in  free  protoporphyrin  rather 
than zinc protoporphyrin. In XLP, both free and zinc protoporphyrin 
are  markedly  increased.  Interpretation  of  laboratory  reports  can  be 
difficult,  because  the  term  free  erythrocyte  protoporphyrin  sometimes 
actually represents zinc protoporphyrin.

The various porphyrias that cause blistering skin lesions can be dif-
ferentiated by measuring porphyrins in urine, feces, and plasma. The 
porphyrias should be confirmed by genetic testing and the demonstra-
tion of the causative pathogenic variant. It is often difficult to diagnose 
or “rule out” porphyria in patients who have had suggestive symptoms 
months or years in the past and in relatives of patients with acute por-
phyrias, because porphyrin precursors and porphyrins may be normal. 
In those situations, detection of the specific gene mutation in the index 
case  can  make  the  diagnosis  and  facilitate  the  diagnosis  and  genetic 
counseling of at-risk relatives. With the increased access and accuracy 
of genetic testing, this often precedes secondary biochemical testing in 
clinical practice. Consultation with a specialist laboratory and physi-
cian will assist in selecting the heme biosynthetic gene or genes to be 
sequenced.

THE HEPATIC PORPHYRIAS
Markedly elevated plasma and urinary concentrations of the porphyrin 
precursors, ALA and/or PBG, which originate from the liver, are espe-
cially evident during attacks of neurologic manifestations of the four 
acute porphyrias—ADP, AIP, HCP, and VP. In PCT, excess porphyrins 
also  accumulate  initially  in  the  liver  and  cause  chronic  blistering  of 
sun-exposed areas of the skin.
 ■ ALA-DEHYDRATASE-DEFICIENT PORPHYRIA
ADP is a rare, autosomal recessive, acute hepatic porphyria caused by a 
severe deficiency of ALA-dehydratase activity. To date, there are only a 
few documented cases, some in children or young adults, in which spe-
cific gene mutations have been identified. These affected homozygotes 
had  <10%  of  normal  ALA-dehydratase  activity  in  erythrocytes,  but 
their  clinically  asymptomatic  parents  and  heterozygous  relatives  had 
about half-normal levels of activity and did not excrete increased levels 
of ALA. The frequency of ADP is unknown, but the frequency of hete-
rozygous individuals with <50% normal ALA-dehydratase activity was 
~2% in a screening study in Sweden. Because there are multiple causes 
for deficient ALA-dehydratase activity, it is important to confirm the 
diagnosis of ADP by mutation analysis.

Clinical  Features  The  clinical  presentation  depends  on  the 
amount of residual ALA-dehydratase activity. Four of the documented 
patients  were  male  adolescents  with  symptoms  resembling  those  of 
AIP,  including  abdominal  pain  and  neuropathy.  One  patient  was  an 
infant with more severe disease, including failure to thrive beginning 
at  birth.  The  earlier  age  of  onset  and  more  severe  manifestations  in 
this  patient  reflect  a  more  significant  deficiency  of  ALA-dehydratase 
activity.  Another  patient  developed  an  acute  motor  polyneuropathy

at  age  63  that  was  associated  with  a  myeloproliferative  disorder.  He 
was  heterozygous  for  an  δ-aminolevulinic  acid  dehydratase  (ALAD) 
mutation that presumably was present in erythroblasts that underwent 
clonal expansion due to the bone marrow malignancy.

Diagnosis  All  patients  had  significantly  elevated  levels  of  plasma 
and  urinary  ALA  and  urinary  coproporphyrin  (COPRO)  III;  ALAD 
activities in erythrocytes were <10% of normal. Hereditary tyrosinemia 
type  1  (fumarylacetoacetase  deficiency)  and  lead  intoxication  should 
be considered in the differential diagnosis because either succinylace-
tone (which accumulates in hereditary tyrosinemia and is structurally 
similar to ALA) or lead can inhibit ALA-dehydratase, increase urinary 
excretion  of  ALA  and  COPRO  III,  and  cause  manifestations  that 
resemble  those  of  the  acute  porphyrias.  Heterozygotes  are  clinically 
asymptomatic  and  do  not  excrete  increased  levels  of  ALA  but  can 
be  detected  by  demonstration  of  intermediate  levels  of  erythrocyte 
ALA-dehydratase  activity  or  a  specific  mutation  in  the  ALAD  gene. 
To date, molecular studies of ADP patients have identified 12 patho-
genic mutations, including missense mutations, splice-site mutations, 
and  a  two-base  deletion  in  the  ALAD  gene  (Human  Gene  Mutation 
Database; www.hgmd.org). The parents in each case were not consan-
guineous, and the index cases had inherited a different ALAD mutation 
from  each  parent.  Prenatal  diagnosis  of  this  disorder  is  possible  by 
determination of ALA-dehydratase activity and/or gene mutations in 
cultured chorionic villi or amniocytes.

Treatment 
 The treatment of ADP acute attacks is similar to that of 
AIP (see below). The severely affected infant referred to above was sup-
ported by hyperalimentation and periodic blood transfusions but did 
not respond to intravenous hemin and died after liver transplantation.

 ■ ACUTE INTERMITTENT PORPHYRIA
This hepatic porphyria is an autosomal dominant condition resulting 
from  the  half-normal  level  of  HMB-synthase  activity.  The  disease  is 
widespread but is especially common in Scandinavia and Great Britain. 
Clinical expression is highly variable, and activation of the disease is 
often related to environmental or hormonal factors, such as drugs, diet, 
and  steroid  hormones.  Attacks  can  be  prevented  by  avoiding  known 
precipitating  factors.  Rare  homozygous  dominant  AIP  also  has  been 
described in children (see below).

Clinical  Features 
Induction  and  increased  expression  of  the 
rate-limiting  hepatic  gene  ALAS1  in  heterozygotes  who  have  half- 
normal  HMB-synthase  activity  is  thought  to  underlie  the  acute 
attacks in AIP. The disorder remains latent (or asymptomatic) in the 
great majority of those who are heterozygous for pathogenic HMBS 
mutations,  and  this  is  almost  always  the  case  prior  to  puberty.  In 
patients  with  no  history  of  acute  symptoms,  porphyrin  precursor 
excretion  is  usually  normal,  suggesting  that  half-normal  hepatic 
HMB-synthase  activity  is  sufficient  and  that  hepatic  ALA-synthase 
activity  is  not  increased.  However,  under  conditions  where  heme 
synthesis is increased in the liver, half-normal HMB-synthase activ-
ity  may  become  limiting,  and  ALA,  PBG,  and  other  heme  pathway 
intermediates may accumulate and be excreted in the urine. Common 
precipitating factors include endogenous and exogenous steroids, por-
phyrinogenic  drugs,  alcohol  ingestion,  and  low-calorie  diets,  usually 
instituted for weight loss.

The fact that AIP is almost always latent before puberty suggests that 
adult levels of steroid hormones are important for clinical expression. 
Symptoms are more common in women, suggesting a role for estrogens 
or  progestins.  Premenstrual  attacks  are  probably  due  to  increasing 
endogenous  progesterone  during  the  luteal  phase  of  the  menstrual 
cycle.  Acute  porphyrias  are  sometimes  exacerbated  by  exogenous 
steroids, including oral contraceptive preparations containing proges-
tins. Surprisingly, pregnancy is usually well tolerated, suggesting that 
beneficial metabolic changes may ameliorate the effects of high levels 
of progesterone. Extensive lists of unsafe and safe drugs are available 
on websites sponsored by the American Porphyria Foundation (www 
.porphyriafoundation.com)  and  the  European  Porphyria  Network 
(https://porphyria.eu/), and at the Drug Database for Acute Porphyrias 

website (www.drugs-porphyria.org). Reduced intake of calories and car-
bohydrate, as may occur with illness or attempts to lose weight, can also 
increase porphyrin precursor excretion and induce attacks of porphy-
ria. Studies in a knockout AIP mouse model indicate that the hepatic 
ALAS1 gene is regulated, in part, by the peroxisome proliferator-acti-
vated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). Hepatic PGC-1α is induced 
by  fasting,  which  in  turn  activates  ALAS1  transcription,  resulting  in 
increased heme biosynthesis. This finding suggests an important link 
between nutritional status and the attacks in acute porphyrias. Attacks 
also can be provoked by infections, surgery, and ethanol.

Because  the  neurovisceral  symptoms  rarely  occur  before  puberty 
and  are  often  nonspecific,  a  high  index  of  suspicion  is  required  to 
make  the  diagnosis.  The  disease  can  be  disabling  but  is  rarely  fatal. 
Abdominal  pain,  the  most  common  symptom,  is  poorly  localized 
but  may  be  associated  with  cramping,  ileus,  abdominal  distention, 
and  decreased  bowel  sounds.  However,  increased  bowel  sounds  and 
diarrhea  may  occur.  Abdominal  tenderness,  fever,  and  leukocytosis 
are  usually  absent  or  mild  because  the  symptoms  are  neurologic 
rather  than  inflammatory.  Nausea;  vomiting;  constipation;  tachycar-
dia; hypertension; mental symptoms; pain in the limbs, head, neck, or 
chest;  muscle  weakness;  sensory  loss;  dysuria;  and  urinary  retention 
are characteristic. Tachycardia, hypertension, restlessness, tremors, and 
excess sweating are due to sympathetic overactivity.

The  peripheral  neuropathy  is  due  to  axonal  degeneration  (rather 
than demyelinization) and primarily affects motor neurons. Significant 
neuropathy does not occur with all acute attacks; abdominal symptoms 
are  usually  more  prominent.  Motor  neuropathy  affects  the  proximal 
muscles initially, more often in the shoulders and arms. The course and 
degree  of  involvement  are  variable  and  sometimes  may  be  focal  and 
involve cranial nerves. Deep tendon reflexes initially may be normal or 
hyperactive but become decreased or absent as the neuropathy advances. 
Sensory changes such as paresthesia and loss of sensation are less prom-
inent. Progression to respiratory and bulbar paralysis and death occurs 
especially when the diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Sudden death 
may result from sympathetic overactivity and cardiac arrhythmia.

Mental symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, depression, disorienta-
tion, hallucinations, and paranoia can occur in acute attacks. Seizures 
can  be  due  to  neurologic  effects  or  to  hyponatremia.  Treatment  of 
seizures is difficult because most antiseizure drugs can exacerbate AIP 
(clonazepam  may  be  safer  than  phenytoin  or  barbiturates).  Hypona-
tremia results from hypothalamic involvement and inappropriate vaso-
pressin secretion or from electrolyte depletion due to vomiting, diarrhea, 
poor  intake,  or  excess  renal  sodium  loss.  When  an  attack  resolves, 
abdominal  pain  may  disappear  within  hours,  and  paresis  begins  to 
improve within days and may continue to improve over several years.

Homozygous  dominant  AIP  (HD-AIP)  is  a  rare  form  of  AIP  in 
which patients inherit HMBS mutations from each of their heterozy-
gous parents and, therefore, have very low (<2%) enzyme activity. The 
disease has been described in a Dutch girl, two young British siblings, 
and a Spanish boy. In these homozygous affected patients, the disease 
presented in infancy with failure to thrive, developmental delay, bilat-
eral  cataracts,  and/or  hepatosplenomegaly.  Urinary  ALA  and  PBG 
concentrations  were  markedly  elevated.  All  of  these  patients’  HMBS 
mutations (R167W, R167Q, and R172Q) were in exon 10 within five 
bases  of  each  other.  Studies  of  the  brain  magnetic  resonance  images 
(MRIs)  of  children  with  homozygous  AIP  have  suggested  damage 
primarily  in  white  matter  that  was  myelinated  postnatally,  while 
tracks  that  myelinated  prenatally  were  normal.  Most  children  with 
homozygous AIP die at an early age. Recently, later-onset HD-AIP was 
described in an adult with leukoencephalopathy.

Diagnosis  ALA  and  PBG  levels  are  substantially  increased  in 
plasma  and  urine,  especially  during  acute  attacks.  For  example,  uri-
nary PBG excretion during an attack is usually 50–200 mg/24 h (220– 
880  μmol/24  h)  (normal,  0–4  mg/24  h,  [0–18  μmol/24  h]),  and  uri-
nary ALA excretion is 20–100 mg/24 h (150–760 μmol/24 h) (normal,  
1–7  mg/24  h  [8–53  μmol/24  h]).  Because  levels  often  remain  high 
after  symptoms  resolve,  the  diagnosis  of  an  acute  attack  in  a  patient 
with biochemically proven AIP is based primarily on clinical features.

3244 Excretion  of  ALA  and  PBG  decreases  over  a  few  days  after  intrave-
nous  hemin  administration  or  treatment  with  givosiran  (see  below). 
A normal urinary PBG level before hemin effectively excludes AIP as 
a  cause  for  current  symptoms.  Fecal  porphyrins  are  usually  normal 
or minimally increased in AIP, in contrast to HCP and VP. Most AIP 
heterozygotes with no history of symptoms have normal urinary excre-
tion of ALA and PBG and are classified as latent. Patients can also have 
high levels of urine PBG and ALA with no clinical symptoms. These 
patients may have a previous history of an acute attack. These patients 
are classified as asymptomatic high excretors (ASHE) or chronic high 
excretors (CHE). Therefore, the detection of the family’s HMBS muta-
tion will diagnose asymptomatic family members. A urinary ALA and 
PBG  will  diagnosis  CHE  patients  who  may  have  a  higher  risk  of  an 
attack if they experience a precipitating factor such as administration 
of a porphyrinogenic drug.

Patients with HMBS mutations in the initiation of translation codon 
in exon 1 and in the intron 15′-splice donor site have normal enzyme 
levels in erythrocytes and deficient activity only in nonerythroid tis-
sues.  This  occurs  because  the  erythroid  and  housekeeping  forms  of 
HMB-synthase are encoded by a single gene, which has two promoters. 
Thus,  the  enzyme  assay  may  not  be  diagnostic,  and  genetic  testing 
should be used to confirm the diagnosis.

More  than  515  HMBS  mutations  have  been  identified  in  AIP, 
including  missense,  nonsense,  and  splicing  mutations  and  insertions 
and deletions, with most mutations found in only one or a few families 
(Human Gene Mutation Database, www.hgmd.org). The prenatal diag-
nosis of a fetus at risk can be made by analysis of the familial mutation 
in  cultured  amniotic  cells  or  chorionic  villi.  However,  this  is  seldom 
done  because  the  prognosis  of  individuals  with  HMBS  mutations  is 
generally favorable.

TREATMENT
Acute Intermittent Porphyria

During  acute  attacks,  narcotic  analgesics  may  be  required  for 
abdominal  pain,  and  phenothiazines  are  useful  for  nausea,  vom-
iting,  anxiety,  and  restlessness.  Chloral  hydrate  can  be  given  for 
insomnia,  and  benzodiazepines  are  probably  safe  in  low  doses  if 
a  minor  tranquilizer  is  required.  Carbohydrate  loading,  usually 
with intravenous glucose (at least 300 g daily), may be effective in 
milder acute attacks of porphyria (without paresis, hyponatremia, 
etc.) if hemin is not available. Intravenous hemin is more effective 
and  should  be  used  as  first-line  therapy  for  all  acute  attacks.  The 
standard regimen is 3–4 mg/kg of heme, in the form of lyophilized 
hematin  (Panhematin,  Recordati  Rare  Diseases),  heme  albumin 
(hematin  reconstituted  with  human  albumin),  or  heme  arginate 
(Orphan Europe), infused daily for 4 days. Heme arginate and heme 
albumin  are  chemically  stable  and  are  less  likely  than  hematin  to 
produce phlebitis or an anticoagulant effect. Recovery depends on 
the  degree  of  neuronal  damage  and  usually  is  rapid  if  therapy  is 
started early. Recovery from severe motor neuropathy may require 
months  or  years.  Identification  and  avoidance  of  inciting  factors 
can  hasten  recovery  from  an  attack  and  prevent  future  attacks. 
Inciting  factors  are  usually  multiple,  and  removal  of  one  or  more 
hastens recovery and helps prevent future attacks. Frequent attacks 
that  occur  during  the  luteal  phase  of  the  menstrual  cycle  may  be 
prevented with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, which 
prevents ovulation and progesterone production, or by prophylactic 
hematin or givosiran administration.

Recently,  a  hepatic-targeted  RNA  interference  (RNAi)  therapy, 
givosiran (Givlarri, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals), was approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines 
Agency  for  the  treatment  of  the  acute  hepatic  porphyrias.  Givo-
siran, a monthly subcutaneous injection of 2.5 mg/kg, is designed 
to silence the expression of hepatic ALAS1 mRNA and was initially 
shown in clinical trials to markedly reduce ALA and PBG levels in 
CHE patients and in patients with recurrent attacks. In a phase 3 
trial in acute hepatic porphyria patients with recurrent attacks, the 

RNAi therapy significantly reduced the frequency of acute attacks, 
decreased hemin utilization, and improved daily pain scores.

The  long-term  risk  of  hypertension  and  chronic  renal  disease  is 
increased  in  AIP;  a  number  of  patients  have  undergone  successful 
renal transplantation. Studies have shown that up to 59% of symp-
tomatic AIP patients will develop chronic kidney disease. The PEPT2 
receptor polymorphic genotype affects the severity and prognosis of 
porphyria-associated kidney disease with the high affinity polymor-
phic PEPT2 *1 allele and the PEPT2 genotypes *1*1 and, to a lesser 
degree,  *1*2  associated  with  decreasing  kidney  function.  Chronic, 
low-grade  abnormalities  in  liver  function  tests  are  common,  and 
the  risk  of  hepatocellular  carcinoma  is  increased.  Hepatic  imaging 
is recommended at least every 6 months for early detection of these 
tumors.  Other  long-term  complications  include neuropathy, fatigue, 
chronic pain, nausea, depression, and/or anxiety.

Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been successful and is 
curative in patients with severe, disabling, intractable attacks that are 
refractory to hemin therapy. Reports from both the United Kingdom 
and the United States show a marked improvement with no subse-
quent attacks, an improvement in the neuropathic manifestations, 
and  normalization  of  the  urinary  PBG  and  ALA  levels  after  liver 
transplantation.  OLT  is  associated  with  morbidity  and  mortality 
and should be considered a treatment of last resort in these patients. 
In  addition,  patients  who  already  have  advanced  neuropathy  are 
considered poor risks for transplantation. Some patients with both 
recurrent attacks and end-stage renal disease have benefitted from 
combined liver and kidney transplantation.

Liver-directed gene therapy has proven successful in the prevention 
of  drug-induced  biochemical  attacks  in  a  murine  model  of  human 
AIP, and clinical trials of adeno-associated virus vector (AAV)-HMBS 
gene transfer have been initiated. Although the therapy was safe, there 
was essentially no biochemical evidence of its effectiveness, nor did it 
prevent recurrent attacks in the treated patients.

 ■ PORPHYRIA CUTANEA TARDA
PCT, the most common of the porphyrias, can be either sporadic (type 1) 
or familial (type 2) and can also develop after exposure to halogenated 
aromatic  hydrocarbons.  Hepatic  URO-decarboxylase  is  deficient  in 
all types of PCT, and for clinical symptoms to manifest, this enzyme 
deficiency must be substantial (~20% of normal activity or less); it is 
currently attributed to generation of an URO-decarboxylase inhibitor 
in the liver, which forms a uroporphomethene in the presence of iron 
and under conditions of oxidative stress. The majority of PCT patients 
(~80%) have no UROD mutations and are said to have sporadic (type 1) 
disease.  PCT  patients  heterozygous  for  UROD  mutations  have  the 
familial (type 2) PCT. In these patients, inheritance of a UROD muta-
tion  from  one  parent  results  in  half-normal  enzyme  activity  in  liver 
and all other tissues, which is a significant predisposing factor but is 
insufficient  by  itself  to  cause  symptomatic  PCT.  As  discussed  below, 
other  genetic  and  environmental  factors  contribute  to  susceptibility 
for both types of PCT. Because penetrance of the genetic trait is low, 
many  patients  with  familial  (type  2)  PCT  have  no  family  history  of 
the disease. HEP is an autosomal recessive form of porphyria due to 
the  inheritance  of  two  pathogenic  UROD  mutations  resulting  in  the 
marked systemic deficiency of URO-decarboxylase activity with clini-
cal symptoms in childhood.

Clinical  Features  Blistering  skin  lesions  that  appear  most 
commonly on the backs of the hands are the major clinical feature 
(Fig. 416-3). These rupture and crust over, leaving areas of atrophy 
and scarring. Lesions may also occur on the forearms, face, legs, and 
feet. Skin friability and small white papules termed milia are common, 
especially  on  the  backs  of  the  hands  and  fingers.  Hypertrichosis  and 
hyperpigmentation,  especially  of  the  face,  are  especially  troublesome 
in  women.  Occasionally,  the  skin  over  sun-exposed  areas  becomes 
severely thickened, with scarring and calcification that resembles sys-
temic sclerosis. Neurologic features are absent.

A number of susceptibility factors, in addition to inherited UROD 
mutations  in  type  2  PCT,  can  be  recognized  clinically  and  can  affect

be removed every 1–2 weeks. The aim is to gradually reduce excess 
hepatic iron until the serum ferritin level reaches the lower limits 
of  normal.  Because  iron  overload  is  not  marked  in  most  cases, 
remission may occur after only five or six phlebotomies; however, 
PCT patients with hemochromatosis may require more treatments 
to bring their iron levels down to the normal range. To document 
improvement  in  PCT,  it  is  most  convenient  to  follow  the  total 
plasma  porphyrin  concentration,  which  becomes  normal  some-
time after the target ferritin level is reached. Hemoglobin levels or 
hematocrits and serum ferritin should be followed closely to pre-
vent development of iron deficiency and anemia. After remission, 
continued phlebotomy may not be needed. Plasma porphyrin levels 
are followed at 6- to 12-month intervals for early detection of recur-
rences, which are treated by additional phlebotomy.

An  alternative  when  phlebotomy  is  contraindicated  or  poorly 
tolerated is a low-dose regimen of chloroquine or hydroxychloro-
quine,  both  of  which  complex  with  the  excess  porphyrins  and 
promote  their  excretion.  Small  doses  (e.g.,  125  mg  chloroquine 
phosphate twice weekly) should be given, because standard doses 
can  induce  transient,  sometimes  marked  increases  in  photosensi-
tivity  and  hepatocellular  damage.  Studies  indicate  that  low-dose 
hydroxychloroquine is as safe and effective as phlebotomy in PCT. 
Hepatic imaging can diagnose or exclude complicating hepatocel-
lular carcinoma. Treatment of PCT in patients with end-stage renal 
disease is facilitated by administration of erythropoietin.

Because  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV)  is  a  common  precipitating 
factor  causing  PCT,  the  recent  development  of  oral  direct-acting 
antivirals for HCV has proven effective as a first primary treatment 
in HCV-infected PCT patients.

 ■ HEREDITARY COPROPORPHYRIA
HCP  is  an  autosomal  dominant  hepatic  porphyria  that  results  from 
the half-normal activity of COPRO-oxidase. The disease presents with 
acute  attacks,  as  in  AIP.  Cutaneous  photosensitivity  also  may  occur, 
but  much  less  commonly  than  in  VP.  HCP  patients  may  have  acute 
attacks  and  cutaneous  photosensitivity  together  or  separately.  HCP 
is  less  common  than  AIP  and  VP.  Homozygous  dominant  HCP  and 
harderoporphyria,  a  biochemically  distinguishable  variant  of  HCP, 
present with clinical symptoms in children (see below).

Clinical Features  HCP is influenced by the same factors that cause 
attacks in AIP. The disease is latent before puberty, and symptoms, which 
are virtually identical to those of AIP, are more common in women. HCP 
is generally less severe than AIP. Blistering skin lesions are identical to 
PCT and VP and begin in childhood in rare homozygous cases.

Diagnosis  COPRO III is markedly increased in the urine and feces 
in  symptomatic  patients  and  often  persists,  especially  in  feces,  when 
there  are  no  symptoms.  Urinary  ALA  and  PBG  levels  are  increased 
(but less than in AIP) during acute attacks but may revert to normal 
more quickly than in AIP when symptoms resolve. Plasma porphyrins 
are usually normal or only slightly increased, but they may be higher 
in cases with skin lesions. The diagnosis of HCP is readily confirmed 
by increased fecal porphyrins consisting almost entirely of COPRO III, 
which distinguishes it from other porphyrias.

Although  the  diagnosis  can  be  confirmed  by  measuring  COPRO- 
oxidase activity, the assays for this mitochondrial enzyme are not avail-
able and require cells other than erythrocytes. To date, >90 mutations 
have been identified in the CPOX gene, ~70% of which are missense or 
nonsense  (Human  Gene  Mutation  Database;  www.hgmd.org).  Detec-
tion  of  a  CPOX  mutation  in  a  symptomatic  individual  permits  the 
identification of asymptomatic family members.

TREATMENT
Hereditary Coproporphyria
Neurologic symptoms are treated as in AIP (see above). Phlebotomy 
and chloroquine are not effective for the cutaneous lesions.

FIGURE 416-3  Typical cutaneous lesions in a patient with porphyria cutanea tarda.

management. These include hepatitis C, HIV, excess alcohol, elevated 
iron levels, and estrogens. The importance of excess hepatic iron as a 
precipitating  factor  is  underscored  by  the  finding  that  the  incidence 
of  the  common  hemochromatosis-causing  mutations,  hemochro-
matosis  gene  (HFE)  mutations  p.C282Y  and  p.H63D,  are  increased 
in  patients  with  types  1  and  2  PCT  (Chap.  414).  Excess  alcohol  is  a 
long-recognized contributor, as is estrogen use in women. HIV is prob-
ably an independent but less common risk factor that, like hepatitis C, 
does  not  cause  PCT  in  isolation.  Multiple  susceptibility  factors  that 
appear  to  act  synergistically  can  be  identified  in  individual  patients. 
PCT  patients  characteristically  have  chronic  liver  disease  and  some-
times  cirrhosis  and  are  at  risk  for  hepatocellular  carcinoma.  Various 
chemicals can also induce PCT; an epidemic of PCT occurred in east-
ern Turkey in the 1950s as a consequence of wheat contaminated with 
the  fungicide  hexachlorobenzene.  PCT  also  occurs  after  exposure  to 
other chemicals, including di- and trichlorophenols and 2,3,7,8-tetra-
chlorodibenzo-(p)-dioxin (TCDD, dioxin).

Diagnosis  Porphyrins are increased in the liver, plasma, urine, and 
stool. The urinary ALA level may be slightly increased, but the PBG 
level  is  normal.  Urinary  porphyrins  consist  mostly  of  uroporphyrins 
and heptacarboxylate porphyrin, with lesser amounts of coproporphy-
rin and hexa- and pentacarboxylate porphyrins. Plasma porphyrins are 
also increased, and fluorometric scanning of diluted plasma at neutral 
pH  can  rapidly  distinguish  VP  and  PCT  (Table  416-3).  Isocopropor-
phyrins,  which  are  increased  in  feces  and  sometimes  in  plasma  and 
urine, are diagnostic for hepatic URO-decarboxylase deficiency.

Type 2 PCT and HEP can be distinguished from type 1 by finding 
decreased  URO-decarboxylase  in  erythrocytes.  URO-decarboxylase 
activity  in  liver,  erythrocytes,  and  cultured  skin  fibroblasts  in  type  2 
PCT  is  ~50%  of  normal  in  affected  individuals  and  in  asymptomatic 
heterozygous family members. In HEP, the URO-decarboxylase activity 
is markedly deficient, with typical levels of 3–10% of normal. Over 145 
mutations have been identified in the UROD gene (Human Gene Muta-
tion Database; www.hgmd.org). Of the mutations listed in the database, 
~65%  are  missense  or  nonsense,  and  ~8%  are  splice-site  mutations. 
Many UROD mutations have been identified in only one or two families.

TREATMENT
Porphyria Cutanea Tarda

Alcohol,  estrogens,  iron  supplements,  and,  if  possible,  any  drugs 
that  may  exacerbate  the  disease  should  be  discontinued,  but  this

 ■ VARIEGATE PORPHYRIA
VP is an autosomal dominant hepatic porphyria that results from the 
deficient activity of PROTO-oxidase, the seventh enzyme in the heme 
biosynthetic  pathway,  and  can  present  with  neurologic  symptoms, 
photosensitivity, or both. VP is particularly common in South Africa, 
where 3 of every 1000 whites have the disorder. Most are descendants 
of  a  couple  who  emigrated  from  the  Netherlands  to  South  Africa  in 
1688. In other countries, VP is less common than AIP. Rare cases of 
homozygous  dominant  VP,  presenting  in  childhood  with  cutaneous 
symptoms, also have been reported.

Clinical Features  VP can present with skin photosensitivity, acute 
neurovisceral crises, or both. In two large studies of VP patients, ~60% 
had only skin lesions, 20% had only acute attacks, and ~20% had both. 
Acute attacks are identical to those in AIP and are precipitated by the 
same  factors  as  AIP  (see  above).  Blistering  skin  manifestations  are 
similar to those in PCT but are more difficult to treat and usually are 
of longer duration. Homozygous VP is associated with photosensitiv-
ity, neurologic symptoms, and developmental disturbances, including 
growth  retardation,  in  infancy  or  childhood;  all  cases  had  increased 
erythrocyte levels of zinc protoporphyrin, a characteristic finding in all 
homozygous porphyrias so far described.

Diagnosis  Urinary ALA and PBG levels are increased during acute 
attacks but may return to normal more quickly than in AIP. Increases 
in fecal protoporphyrin and COPRO III and in urinary COPRO III are 
more  persistent.  Plasma  porphyrin  levels  also  are  increased,  particu-
larly when there are cutaneous lesions. VP can be distinguished rapidly 
from  all  other  porphyrias  by  examining  the  fluorescence  emission 
spectrum of porphyrins in plasma since VP has a unique fluorescence 
peak at neutral pH.

Assays  of  PROTO-oxidase  activity  in  cultured  fibroblasts  or  lym-
phocytes  are  not  widely  available.  Over  205  mutations  have  been 
identified in the PPOX gene from unrelated VP patients (Human Gene 
Mutation  Database;  www.hgmd.org).  The  missense  mutation  R59W 
is  the  common  mutation  in  most  South  Africans  with  VP  of  Dutch 
descent. Five missense mutations were common in English and French 
VP patients; however, most mutations have been found in only one or 
a few families.

TREATMENT
Variegate Porphyria
Acute  attacks  are  treated  as  in  AIP,  and  hemin  should  be  started 
early in most cases. Givosiran has proven effective in clinical trials 
for patients with recurrent attacks. Other than avoiding sun expo-
sure, there are few effective measures for treating the skin lesions. 
β-Carotene, phlebotomy, and chloroquine are not helpful.

THE ERYTHROPOIETIC PORPHYRIAS
In the erythropoietic porphyrias, excess porphyrins from bone marrow 
erythrocyte precursors are transported via the plasma to the skin and 
lead to cutaneous photosensitivity.

 ■ X-LINKED SIDEROBLASTIC ANEMIA
XLSA  results  from  the  deficient  activity  of  the  erythroid  form  of 
ALA-synthase (ALA-synthase 2) and is associated with ineffective ery-
thropoiesis, weakness, and pallor.

Clinical Features  Typically,  males  with  XLSA  develop  refractory 
hemolytic  anemia,  pallor,  and  weakness  during  infancy.  They  have 
secondary  hypersplenism,  become  iron  overloaded,  and  can  develop 
hemosiderosis. The severity depends on the level of residual erythroid 
ALA-synthase activity and on the responsiveness of the specific muta-
tion to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate supplementation (see below). Peripheral 
blood smears reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia with striking 
anisocytosis,  poikilocytosis,  and  polychromasia;  the  leukocytes  and 
platelets appear normal. Hemoglobin content is reduced, and the mean 
corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 

are  decreased.  Patients  with  milder,  later-onset  disease  have  been 
reported recently.

Diagnosis  Bone marrow examination reveals hypercellularity with 
a left shift and megaloblastic erythropoiesis with an abnormal matu-
ration.  A  variety  of  Prussian  blue–staining  sideroblasts  are  observed. 
Levels of urinary porphyrin precursors and of both urinary and fecal 
porphyrins  are  normal.  The  activity  of  erythroid  ALA-synthase  2  is 
decreased in bone marrow, but this enzyme is difficult to measure in 
the  presence  of  the  normal  ALA-synthase  1  housekeeping  enzyme. 
Definitive  diagnosis  requires  the  demonstration  of  loss-of-function 
mutations  in  the  erythroid  ALAS2  gene,  of  which  >110  have  been 
identified.

Treatment  The severe anemia may respond to pyridoxine supple-
mentation.  This  cofactor  is  essential  for  ALA-synthase  activity,  and 
mutations  in  the  pyridoxine  binding  site  of  the  enzyme  have  been 
found  in  several  responsive  patients.  Cofactor  supplementation  may 
make it possible to eliminate or reduce the frequency of transfusions. 
Unresponsive  patients  may  be  transfusion  dependent  and  require 
chelation therapy.

 ■ CONGENITAL ERYTHROPOIETIC PORPHYRIA
CEP,  also  known  as  Günther’s  disease,  is  an  autosomal  recessive  dis-
order.  It  is  due  to  the  markedly  deficient,  but  not  absent,  activity  of 
URO-synthase and the resultant accumulation of URO I and COPRO 
I  isomers.  CEP  is  associated  with  hemolytic  anemia  and  cutaneous 
lesions.

Clinical  Features  Severe  cutaneous  photosensitivity  typically 
begins  from  birth.  The  skin  over  light-exposed  areas  is  friable,  and 
bullae and vesicles are prone to rupture and infection. Skin thickening, 
focal hypo- and hyperpigmentation, and hypertrichosis of the face and 
extremities  are  characteristic.  Secondary  infection  of  the  cutaneous 
lesions  can  lead  to  disfigurement  of  the  face  and  hands.  Porphyrins 
are deposited in teeth and in bones. As a result, the teeth are brownish 
and  fluoresce  on  exposure  to  long-wave  ultraviolet  light.  Hemolysis 
is due to the marked increase in erythrocyte porphyrins and leads to 
splenomegaly. Adults with a milder later-onset form of the disease also 
have been described.

Diagnosis  URO  and  COPRO  (mostly  type  I  isomers)  accumulate 
in the bone marrow, erythrocytes, plasma, urine, and feces. The pre-
dominant porphyrin in feces is COPRO I. The diagnosis of CEP can 
be confirmed by demonstration of markedly deficient URO-synthase 
activity and/or by the identification of specific mutations in the UROS 
gene.  The  disease  can  be  detected  in  utero  by  measuring  porphyrins 
in  amniotic  fluid  and  URO-synthase  activity  in  cultured  amniotic 
cells or chorionic villi or by the detection of the family’s specific gene 
mutations.  Molecular  analyses  of  the  mutant  alleles  from  unrelated 
patients have revealed the presence of >55 mutations in the UROS gene, 
including  six  in  the  erythroid-specific  promoter  of  the  UROS  gene. 
Genotype/phenotype  correlations  can  predict  the  severity  of  the  dis-
ease. The CEP phenotype may be modulated by sequence variations in 
the erythroid-specific ALA-synthase 2, the mutation of which typically 
causes XLP. One mutation (p.ArgR216WTrp) in GATA1, encoding the 
X-linked erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA binding protein 
1 (GATA1), has been identified in an individual with CEP, thrombocy-
topenia, and β thalassemia.

TREATMENT
Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria
Severe cases often require transfusions for anemia. Chronic trans-
fusions of sufficient fresh packed erythrocytes to suppress erythro-
poiesis  are  effective  in  reducing  porphyrin  production  but  result 
in iron overload. Splenectomy may reduce hemolysis and decrease 
transfusion requirements. Protection from sunlight and from minor 
skin trauma is important. Complicating bacterial infections should 
be treated promptly. Recently, non-transfusion-dependent patients

have been treated by periodic phlebotomies to decrease iron levels, 
thereby  decreasing  erythropoiesis  and  porphyrin  accumulation. 
This approach has not been evaluated in clinical trials to date. Bone 
marrow  and  cord  blood  transplantation  has  proven  curative  in 
transfusion-dependent  children,  providing  the  rationale  for  stem 
cell gene therapy.

 ■ ERYTHROPOIETIC PROTOPORPHYRIA
EPP  is  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder  resulting  from  the  deficient 
activity  of  FECH,  the  last  enzyme  in  the  heme  biosynthetic  pathway. 
EPP  is  the  most  common  erythropoietic  porphyria  in  children  and, 
after PCT, the second most common porphyria in adults. EPP patients 
have FECH activities as low as 15–25% of normal in lymphocytes and 
cultured  fibroblasts.  Protoporphyrin  IX  accumulates  in  bone  marrow 
reticulocytes and circulating erythrocytes, is released into the plasma, 
and then is taken up in the liver where it is excreted in the bile and feces. 
Plasma  protoporphyrin  IX  taken  up  by  the  vascular  cells  in  the  skin 
is  photoactivated  on  exposure  to  sunlight  causing  phototoxic  cellular 
damage and excruciatingly painful nonblistering phototoxicity. In most 
symptomatic patients (>95%) with this disorder, a deleterious mutation 
in one FECH allele was inherited with the relatively common (~10% of 
Caucasians)  intronic  3  (IVS3)  alteration  (IVS3–48T>C)  on  the  other 
allele that results in the low expression of the normal enzyme. In ~2% of 
EPP families, two FECH deleterious mutations have been found.

XLP  is  a  less  common  condition  with  the  same  phenotype  in 
affected  males,  including  increased  erythrocyte  protoporphyrin  IX 
levels  resulting  from  gain-of-function  mutations  in  the  last  exon  of 
the erythroid-specific form of 5-aminolevulinate-synthase 2 (ALAS2). 
These  mutations  delete  or  alter  the  ALAS2  C-terminal  amino  acids 
resulting  in  its  increased  activity  and  the  subsequent  accumulation 
of  protoporphyrin  IX.  Manifestations  in  female  heterozygotes  with 
XLP can range from asymptomatic to as severe as their affected male 
relatives. The variation in the presence and severity of manifestations 
in XLP heterozygotes results primarily from random X-chromosomal 
inactivation. XLP accounts for ~2–10% of cases with the EPP pheno-
type in Europe and North America. Rare patients with EPP symptoms 
and elevated erythrocyte protoporphyrin IX levels do not have muta-
tions in FECH or ALAS2 on genetic testing. In an affected family with 
EPP symptoms and accumulation of protoporphyrin IX, an autosomal 
dominant mutation was found in human CLPX, a modulator of heme 
biosynthesis.

Clinical Features 
In EPP and male XLP patients, skin photosen-
sitivity, which differs from that in other cutaneous porphyrias, usually 
begins  in  early  childhood.  The  initial  symptoms  on  sun  exposure 
consist of tingling, stinging, itching, or heat/burning sensations on the 
exposed skin occurring within <10 to 30 min of exposure in >60% of 
patients; most will have these prodromal symptoms within an hour of 
sun exposure. The prodromal symptoms are the “warning signal” to 
get  out  of  the  sun,  thereby  avoiding  a  severe  incapacitating  painful 
attack that can last from 2–5 days. Photosensitivity is associated with 
substantial  elevations  in  erythrocyte  protoporphyrin  IX  and  occurs 
only in patients with genotypes that result in FECH activities below 
~35% of normal. Vesicular lesions are uncommon. Redness and swell-
ing develop after prolonged sun exposure and resemble angioedema 
(Fig. 416-4). Pain symptoms may seem out of proportion to the visible 
skin involvement. Chronic skin changes may include lichenification, 
leathery  pseudovesicles,  labial  grooving,  and  nail  changes.  Severe 
scarring is rare, as are pigment changes, friability, and hirsutism. Unless 
hepatic or other complications develop, protoporphyrin IX levels and 
symptoms  of  photosensitivity  tend  to  remain  remarkably  stable  over 
many years in most patients. Factors that exacerbate the hepatic por-
phyrias play no role in EPP or XLP.

The  primary  source  of  excess  protoporphyrin  is  the  bone  marrow 
erythroid cells. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin IX is free (not complexed 
with zinc) and is mostly bound to hemoglobin. In plasma, protopor-
phyrin IX is bound to albumin. Hemolysis and anemia are absent or 
usually mild.

FIGURE 416-4  Erythema and edema of the hands due to acute photosensitivity in a 
10-year-old  boy  with  erythropoietic  protoporphyria.  (Reproduced  with  permission 
from P Poblete-Gutiérrez et al: The porphyrias: clinical presentation, diagnosis and 
treatment. Eur J Dermatol 16:230, 2006.)

Although  EPP  is  an  erythropoietic  porphyria,  up  to  27%  of  EPP 
patients may have minor abnormalities of liver function, and in ~2–5% 
of these patients, the accumulation of protoporphyrins causes chronic 
liver disease that can progress to liver failure requiring transplantation. 
Protoporphyrin  IX  is  insoluble,  and  excess  amounts  form  crystalline 
structures in liver cells (Fig. 416-4) and can decrease hepatic bile flow. 
Studies in the mouse model of EPP have shown that the bile duct epi-
thelium may be damaged by toxic bile, leading to biliary fibrosis. Thus, 
rapidly progressive liver disease appears to be related to the cholestatic 
effects  of  protoporphyrins  and  is  associated  with  increasing  hepatic 
protoporphyrin IX levels due to impaired hepatobiliary excretion and 
increased  photosensitivity.  The  hepatic  complications  also  are  often 
characterized by increasing levels of protoporphyrins in erythrocytes 
and plasma as well as severe abdominal and back pains, especially in 
the right upper quadrant. Gallstones composed at least in part of pro-
toporphyrin IX occur in some patients. Hepatic complications appear 
to  be  higher  in  EPP  due  to  two  pathogenic  FECH  mutations  and  in 
males with XLP.

Diagnosis  A substantial increase in erythrocyte protoporphyrin IX, 
which is predominantly free and not complexed with zinc, is the hall-
mark of EPP. Protoporphyrin levels also are variably increased in bone 
marrow, plasma, bile, and feces. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin IX concen-
trations are increased in other conditions such as lead poisoning, iron 
deficiency, various hemolytic disorders, all homozygous forms of other 
porphyrias, and sometimes even in acute porphyrias. In all these con-
ditions,  however,  in  contrast  to  EPP,  protoporphyrin  IX  is  complexed 
with  zinc.  Therefore,  after  an  increase  in  erythrocyte  protoporphyrin 
IX is found in a suspected EPP patient, it is important to confirm the 
diagnosis by an assay that distinguishes free and zinc-complexed pro-
toporphyrin. Erythrocytes in EPP also exhibit red fluorescence under 
fluorescence microscopy at 620 nm. Urinary levels of porphyrins and 
porphyrin  precursors  are  normal.  FECH  activity  in  cultured  lympho-
cytes or fibroblasts is decreased (<30% of normal mean). DNA diagno-
sis by mutation analysis is recommended to detect the causative FECH 
mutation(s)  and/or  the  presence  of  the  IVS3–48T>C  low  expression 
allele. To date, >220 mutations have been identified in the FECH gene, 
many  of  which  result  in  an  unstable  or  absent  enzyme  protein  (null 
alleles) (Human Gene Mutation Database; www.hgmd.org).

In XLP, the erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels appear to be higher 
than in EPP, and the proportions of free and zinc protoporphyrin IX 
may reach 50%. XLP accounts for ~2% of patients with the EPP phe-
notype  in  Western  Europe.  Recent  studies  show  that  ~10%  of  North 
American patients with the EPP phenotype have XLP.

TREATMENT
Erythropoietic Protoporphyria

Avoiding sunlight exposure and wearing clothing designed to pro-
vide protection for conditions with chronic phototoxicity are essen-
tial. Various other treatments, including oral β-carotene, have proven 
of  little  benefit.  Afamelanotide,  an  α-melanocyte-stimulating  hor-
mone (MSH) analogue that stimulates tanning, has been approved 
for the treatment of EPP and XLP in the European Union by the 
European  Medicines  Agency  and  in  the  United  States  by  the  U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration. Dersimelagon, an orally adminis-
tered,  small-molecule,  selective  melanocortin-1  receptor  (MC1R) 
agonist  that  increases  skin  melanin  without  sun  exposure,  is  cur-
rently in phase 3 clinical trials for EPP and XLP.

Treatment  of  hepatic  complications,  which  may  be  accompa-
nied  by  motor  neuropathy,  is  difficult.  Cholestyramine  and  other 
porphyrin absorbents such as activated charcoal may interrupt the 
enterohepatic circulation of protoporphyrin and promote its fecal 
excretion, leading to some improvement. Plasmapheresis and intra-
venous hemin are sometimes beneficial.

Liver  transplantation  has  been  carried  out  in  some  EPP  and 
XLP patients with severe liver complications and is often successful 
in the short term. However, the disease often recurs in the trans-
planted liver due to continued bone marrow production of excess 
protoporphyrin.  In  a  retrospective  study  of  17  liver-transplanted 
EPP patients, 11 (65%) had recurrent EPP liver disease. Posttrans-
plantation  treatment  with  hematin  and  plasmapheresis  should  be 
considered to prevent the recurrence of liver disease. However, bone 
marrow transplantation, which has been successful in human EPP 
and which prevented liver disease in a mouse model, should be con-
sidered after liver transplantation, if a suitable donor can be found.

417 Disorders of Purine and 
Pyrimidine Metabolism
John N. Mecchella, Christopher M. Burns

Purines  (adenine  and  guanine)  and  pyrimidines  (cytosine,  thymine, 
uracil) serve fundamental roles in the replication of genetic material, 
gene transcription, protein synthesis, and cellular metabolism. Disor-
ders that involve abnormalities of nucleotide metabolism range from 
relatively common diseases such as hyperuricemia and gout, in which 
there is increased production or impaired excretion of a metabolic end 
product of purine metabolism (uric acid), to rare enzyme deficiencies 
that  affect  purine  and  pyrimidine  synthesis  or  degradation.  Under-
standing these biochemical pathways has led, in some instances, to the 
development of specific forms of treatment, such as the use of allopu-
rinol and febuxostat to reduce uric acid production.

URIC ACID METABOLISM
Uric  acid  is  the  final  breakdown  product  of  purine  degradation  in 
humans.  It  is  a  weak  diprotic  acid  with  pKa  values  of  5.75  and  10.3. 
Urates, the ionized forms of uric acid, predominate in plasma, extra-
cellular fluid, and synovial fluid, with ~98% existing as monosodium 
urate at pH 7.4.

Plasma  is  saturated  with  monosodium  urate  at  a  concentration  of 
405  μmol/L  (6.8  mg/dL)  at  37°C.  At  higher  concentrations,  plasma 
is  therefore  supersaturated—a  situation  that  creates  the  potential  for 
urate crystal precipitation. However, plasma urate concentrations can 
reach 4800 μmol/L (80 mg/dL) without precipitation, perhaps because 
of the presence of solubilizing substances.

The pH of urine greatly influences the solubility of uric acid. At pH 
5.0,  urine  is  saturated  with  uric  acid  at  concentrations  ranging  from 
360 to 900 μmol/L (6–15 mg/dL). At pH 7.0, saturation is reached at 
concentrations from 9840 to 12,000 μmol/L (158–200 mg/dL). Ionized 
forms of uric acid in urine include monosodium, disodium, potassium, 
ammonium, and calcium urates.

Although  purine  nucleotides  are  synthesized  and  degraded  in  all 
tissues, urate is produced only in tissues that contain xanthine oxidase, 
primarily the liver and small intestine. Urate production varies with the 
purine content of the diet and with rates of purine biosynthesis, degra-
dation, and salvage (Fig. 417-1). Normally, two-thirds to three-fourths

FIGURE 417-1  The total-body urate pool is the net result between urate production 
and excretion. Urate production is influenced by dietary intake of purines and the 
rates of de novo biosynthesis of purines from nonpurine precursors, nucleic acid 
turnover, and salvage by phosphoribosyltransferase activities. The formed urate is 
normally excreted by urinary and intestinal routes. Hyperuricemia can result from 
increased production, decreased excretion, or a combination of both mechanisms. 
When hyperuricemia exists, urate can precipitate and deposit in tissues as tophi.

inside the cell, thereby stimulating anion exchange 
and  urate  reabsorption  (trans-stimulation).  The 
activities  of  URAT1,  other  OATs,  and  sodium 
anion  transporters  result  in  excretion  of  8–12% 
of the filtered urate as uric acid.

Most  children  have  serum  urate  concentra-
tions  of  180–240  μmol/L  (3–4  mg/dL).  Levels 
begin to rise in males during puberty but remain 
low in females until menopause. The most recent 
mean serum urate values for men and premeno-
pausal  women  in  the  United  States  are  415  and 
360 μmol/L (6.14 and 4.87 mg/dL), respectively, 
according to National Health and Nutrition Eval-
uation  Survey  (NHANES)  data  for  2007–2008. 
After  menopause,  values  for  women  increase 
to  approximately  those  for  men.  In  adulthood, 
concentrations  rise  steadily  over  time  and  vary 
with  height,  body  weight,  blood  pressure,  renal 
function, and alcohol intake.

HYPERURICEMIA
Hyperuricemia  can  result  from  increased  pro-
duction  or  decreased  excretion  of  uric  acid  or 
from  a  combination  of  the  two  processes.  Sus-
tained hyperuricemia predisposes some individ-
uals to develop clinical manifestations, including 
gouty  arthritis  (Chap.  372),  urolithiasis,  and 
renal dysfunction (see below).

of urate is excreted by the kidneys, and most of the remainder is elim-
inated through the intestines.

The kidneys clear urate from the plasma and maintain physiologic 
balance by utilizing specific organic anion transporters (OATs), includ-
ing urate transporter 1 (URAT1, SLC22A12) (Fig. 417-2). In humans, 
OAT1  (SLC22A6),  OAT2  (SLC22A7),  and  OAT3  (SLC22A8)  are 
located on the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. 
OAT4 (SLC22A11), OAT10 (SLC22A13), and URAT1 are located on 
the apical brush-border membrane of these cells. The latter trans-
porters carry urate and other organic anions into the tubular cells 
from the lumen in exchange for intracellular organic anions. Once 
inside the cell, urate must pass to the basolateral side of the lumen 
in  a  process  controlled  by  voltage-dependent  carriers,  including 
glucose  transporter  9  (GLUT9,  SLC2A9).  Uricosuric  compounds  
(Table 417-1) directly inhibit URAT1 on the apical side of the tubu-
lar cell (so-called cis-inhibition). In contrast, antiuricosuric compounds 
(those  that  promote  hyperuricemia),  such  as  nicotinate,  pyrazinoate, 
lactate, and other aromatic organic acids, serve as the exchange anion

In  general,  hyperuricemia  is  defined  as  a 
plasma  (or  serum)  urate  concentration  >405 
μmol/L  (>6.8  mg/dL).  The  risk  of  developing 
gouty  arthritis  or  urolithiasis  increases  with 
higher  urate  levels  and  escalates  in  proportion 
to  the  degree  of  elevation.  The  prevalence  of  hyperuricemia  is 
increasing among ambulatory adults and even more markedly among 
hospitalized  patients.  The  prevalence  of  gout  in  the  United  States 
more  than  doubled  between  the  1960s  and  the  1990s.  Based  on 
NHANES  data  from  2007  to  2008,  these  trends  continue,  with  an 
approximate  prevalence  of  gout  among  men  of  5.9%  (6.1  million) 
and  among  women  of  2.0%  (2.2  million).  Mean  serum  urate  levels 
rose to 6.14 mg/dL among men and 4.87 mg/dL among women, with 
consequent  hyperuricemia  prevalences  of  21.2  and  21.6%,  respec-
tively (with hyperuricemia defined as a serum urate level of >7.0 mg/dL  
[415  μmol/L]  for  men  and  >5.7  mg/dL  [340  μmol/L]  for  women). 
These numbers represent a 1.2% increase in the prevalence of gout, a 
0.15-mg/dL increase in the serum urate level, and a 3.2% increase in 
the prevalence of hyperuricemia over figures reported in NHANES-III 
(1988–1994).  These  rises  are  thought  to  be  driven  by  increased  obe-
sity  and  hypertension  and  perhaps  also  by  better  medical  care  and 
increased longevity.

 ■ CAUSES OF HYPERURICEMIA
Hyperuricemia may be classified as primary or secondary, depend-
ing  on  whether  the  cause  is  innate  or  an  acquired  disorder.  How-
ever,  it  is  more  useful  to  classify  hyperuricemia  in  relation  to  the 
underlying pathophysiology—i.e., whether it results from increased 
production, decreased excretion, or a combination of the two (Fig. 417-1, 
Table 417-2).

Increased Urate Production  Diet contributes to the serum urate 
concentration  in  proportion  to  its  purine  content.  Strict  restriction 
of  purine  intake  reduces  the  mean  serum  urate  level  by  ~60  μmol/L  
(~1  mg/dL)  and  urinary  uric  acid  excretion  by  ~1.2  mmol/d  
(~200 mg/d). Foods high in nucleic acid content include liver, “sweet-
breads” (i.e., thymus and pancreas), kidney, and anchovy.

Endogenous sources of purine production also influence the serum 
urate  level  (Fig.  417-3).  De  novo  purine  biosynthesis  is  a  multistep 
process that forms inosine monophosphate (IMP). The rates of purine 
biosynthesis  and  urate  production  are  predominantly  determined

Serum urate levels are closely coupled to the rates of de novo purine 
biosynthesis, which is driven in part by the level of PRPP, as evidenced 
by  two  X-linked  inborn  errors  of  purine  metabolism  (Table  417-3). 
Both  increased  PRPP  synthetase  activity  and  HPRT  deficiency  are 
associated with overproduction of purines, hyperuricemia, and hype-
ruricaciduria (see below for clinical descriptions).

Accelerated  purine  nucleotide  degradation  can  also  cause  
hyperuricemia—i.e.,  with  conditions  of  rapid  cell  turnover,  prolifer-
ation,  or  cell  death,  as  in  leukemic  blast  crises,  cytotoxic  therapy  for 
malignancy, hemolysis, or rhabdomyolysis. Hyperuricemia can result 
from  excessive  degradation  of  skeletal  muscle  ATP  after  strenuous 
physical exercise or status epilepticus and in glycogen storage disease 
types  III,  V,  and  VII  (Chap.  419).  The  hyperuricemia  of  myocardial 
infarction, smoke inhalation, and acute respiratory failure may also be 
related to accelerated breakdown of ATP.

Decreased  Uric  Acid  Excretion  More  than  90%  of  individuals 
with  sustained  hyperuricemia  have  a  defect  in  the  renal  handling  of 
uric acid. For any given plasma urate concentration, patients who have 
gout excrete ~40% less uric acid than those who do not. When plasma 
urate levels are raised by purine ingestion or infusion, uric acid excre-
tion increases in patients with and without gout; however, in those with 
gout,  plasma  urate  concentrations  must  be  60–120  μmol/L  (1–2  mg/
dL) higher than normal to achieve equivalent uric acid excretion rates.
Diminished  uric  acid  excretion  could  theoretically  result  from 
decreased  glomerular  filtration,  decreased  tubular  secretion,  or 
enhanced  tubular  reabsorption.  Decreased  urate  filtration  does  not 
appear  to  cause  primary  hyperuricemia  but  does  contribute  to  the 
hyperuricemia  of  renal  insufficiency.  Although  hyperuricemia  is 
invariably  present  in  chronic  renal  disease,  the  correlation  among 
serum  creatinine,  urea  nitrogen,  and  urate  concentrations  is  poor. 
Extrarenal  clearance  of  uric  acid  increases  as  renal  damage  becomes 
more severe.

Many  agents  that  cause  hyperuricemia  exert  their  effects  by  stim-
ulating  reabsorption  rather  than  inhibiting  secretion.  This  stimu-
lation  appears  to  occur  through  a  process  of  “priming”  renal  urate 
reabsorption  through  the  sodium-dependent  loading  of  proximal 
tubular  epithelial  cells  with  anions  capable  of  trans-stimulating  urate 
reabsorption.  The  sodium-coupled  monocarboxyl  transporters 
SMCT1  and  2  (SLC5A8,  SLC5A12)  in  the  brush  border  of  the  prox-
imal  tubular  cells  mediate  sodium-dependent  loading  of  these  cells 
with  monocarboxylates.  A  similar  transporter,  SLC13A3,  mediates  
sodium-dependent influx of dicarboxylates into the epithelial cell from 
the basolateral membrane. Some of these carboxylates are well known 
to  cause  hyperuricemia,  including  pyrazinoate  (from  pyrazinamide 
treatment),  nicotinate  (from  niacin  therapy),  and  the  organic  acids 
lactate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate. The mono- and divalent 
anions then become substrates for URAT1 and OAT4, respectively, and 
are exchanged for uric acid from the proximal tubule. Increased blood 
levels of these anions result in their increased glomerular filtration and 
greater reabsorption by proximal tubular cells. The increased intraep-
ithelial cell concentrations lead to increased uric acid reabsorption by 
promoting URAT1-, OAT4-, and OAT10-dependent anion exchange. 
Low  doses  of  salicylates  also  promote  hyperuricemia  by  this  mecha-
nism.  Sodium  loading  of  proximal  tubular  cells  also  provokes  urate 
retention by reducing extracellular fluid volume and increasing angi-
otensin II, insulin, and parathyroid hormone release. Additional OAT1, 
OAT2, and OAT3 are involved in the movement of uric acid through 
the basolateral membrane, although the detailed mechanisms are still 
being elucidated.

GLUT9 (SLC2A9) is an electrogenic hexose transporter with splic-
ing variants that mediate co-reabsorption of uric acid along with glu-
cose and fructose at the apical membrane (GLUT9ΔN/SLC2A9v2) as 
well as through the basolateral membrane (SLC2A9v1) and thus into 
the circulation. GLUT9 has recently been identified as a high-capacity 
urate  transporter,  with  rates  45–60  times  faster  than  its  glucose/ 
fructose transport activity. GLUT9 may be responsible for the observed

association of the consumption of fructose-sweetened soft drinks with 
an increased risk of hyperuricemia and gout. Genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) suggest that polymorphisms in SLC2A9 may play an 
important  role  in  susceptibility  to  gout  in  the  Caucasian  population. 
The  presence  of  one  predisposing  variant  allele  increases  the  relative 
risk of developing gout by 30–70%, most likely by increasing expres-
sion of the shorter isoform, SLC2A9v2 (GLUT9ΔN). GWAS have iden-
tified over 30 loci associated with serum urate levels, most encoding 
transporters  in  the  gut  or  kidney.  Recent  meta-analyses  suggest  that 
genetic  polymorphisms  may  explain  up  to  23.9%  of  the  variation  in 
serum urate levels, much higher than previously appreciated. However, 
the utility of genetic testing for relevant polymorphisms remains inves-
tigational with few exceptions. The Q141K variant of ABCG2, which 
encodes a urate transporter that secretes urate in the small intestine, 
is associated with early onset and severe gout and resistance to allopu-
rinol. The HLA-B*50:10 genotype is associated with allopurinol hyper-
sensitivity in Asian populations. This field is evolving rapidly.

Alcohol promotes hyperuricemia because of increased urate produc-
tion and decreased uric acid excretion. Excessive alcohol consumption 
accelerates  hepatic  breakdown  of  ATP  to  increase  urate  production. 
Alcohol  consumption  can  also  induce  hyperlacticacidemia,  which 
blocks uric acid secretion. The higher purine content in some alcoholic 
beverages may also be a factor. Consumption of beer confers a greater 
risk of gout than liquor, and moderate wine intake does not increase 
gout  risk.  Intake  of  red  meat  and  fructose  increases  the  risk  of  gout, 
whereas intake of low-fat dairy products, purine-rich vegetables, whole 
grains,  nuts  and  legumes,  less  sugary  fruits,  coffee,  and  vitamin  C 
reduces the risk.

EVALUATION
Hyperuricemia does not necessarily represent a disease, nor is it a spe-
cific indication for therapy. The decision to treat depends on the cause 
and the potential consequences of hyperuricemia in each individual.

Quantification  of  uric  acid  excretion  can  be  used  to  determine 
whether  hyperuricemia  is  caused  by  overproduction  or  decreased 
excretion.  On  a  purine-free  diet,  men  with  normal  renal  function 
excrete <3.6 mmol/d (600 mg/d). Thus, the hyperuricemia of individu-
als who excrete uric acid above this level while on a purine-free diet is 
due to purine overproduction; for those who excrete lower amounts on 
the purine-free diet, it is due to decreased excretion. If the assessment is 
performed while the patient is on a regular diet, the level of 4.2 mmol/d 
(800 mg/d) can be used as the discriminating value.

COMPLICATIONS
The most recognized complication of hyperuricemia is gouty arthritis. 
NHANES 2007–2008 found a prevalence of gout among U.S. adults of 
3.9%,  with  figures  of  ~6%  for  men  and  ~2%  for  women.  The  higher 
the serum urate level, the more likely an individual is to develop gout. 
In one study, the incidence of gout was 4.9% among individuals with 
serum  urate  concentrations  >540  μmol/L  (>9.0  mg/dL)  as  opposed 

to  only  0.5%  among  those  with  values  between  415  and  535  μmol/L  
(7.0 and 8.9 mg/dL). The complications of gout correlate with both the 
duration and the severity of hyperuricemia. For further discussion of 
gout, see Chap. 372.

Hyperuricemia also causes several renal problems: (1) nephrolithia-
sis; (2) urate nephropathy, a rare cause of renal insufficiency attributed 
to  monosodium  urate  crystal  deposition  in  the  renal  interstitium; 
and (3) uric acid nephropathy, a reversible cause of acute renal failure 
resulting from deposition of large amounts of uric acid crystals in the 
renal collecting ducts, pelvis, and ureters.

Nephrolithiasis  Uric acid nephrolithiasis occurs most commonly, 
but not exclusively, in individuals with gout. In gout, the prevalence of 
nephrolithiasis correlates with the serum and urinary uric acid levels, 
reaching ~50% with serum urate levels of 770 μmol/L (13 mg/dL) or 
urinary uric acid excretion >6.5 mmol/d (1100 mg/d).

Uric  acid  stones  can  develop  in  individuals  with  no  evidence  of 
arthritis, only 20% of whom are hyperuricemic. Uric acid can also play 
a  role  in  other  types  of  kidney  stones.  Some  individuals  who  do  not 
have gout but have calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stones have 
hyperuricemia or hyperuricaciduria. Uric acid may act as a nidus on 
which calcium oxalate can precipitate or lower the formation product 
for calcium oxalate crystallization.

Urate  Nephropathy  Urate  nephropathy,  sometimes  referred  to 
as  urate  nephrosis,  is  a  late  manifestation  of  severe  gout  and  is  char-
acterized  histologically  by  deposits  of  monosodium  urate  crystals 
surrounded  by  a  giant-cell  inflammatory  reaction  in  the  medullary 
interstitium  and  pyramids.  The  disorder  is  now  rare  and  cannot  be 
diagnosed in the absence of gouty arthritis. The lesions may be clini-
cally silent or cause proteinuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.

Uric Acid Nephropathy  This reversible cause of acute renal fail-
ure is due to precipitation of uric acid in renal tubules and collecting 
ducts  that  obstructs  urine  flow.  Uric  acid  nephropathy  develops  fol-
lowing  sudden  urate  overproduction  and  marked  hyperuricaciduria. 
Factors that favor uric acid crystal formation include dehydration and 
acidosis.  This  form  of  acute  renal  failure  occurs  most  often  during 
an  aggressive  “blastic”  phase  of  leukemia  or  lymphoma  prior  to  or 
coincident with cytolytic therapy but has also been observed in indi-
viduals  with  other  neoplasms,  following  epileptic  seizures,  and  after 
vigorous exercise with heat stress. Autopsy studies have demonstrated 
intraluminal  precipitates  of  uric  acid,  dilated  proximal  tubules,  and 
normal glomeruli. The initial pathogenic events are believed to include 
obstruction  of  collecting  ducts  with  uric  acid  and  obstruction  of  the 
distal renal vasculature.

If  recognized,  uric  acid  nephropathy  is  potentially  reversible. 
Appropriate therapy has reduced the mortality rate from ~50% to near 
zero. Serum levels cannot be relied on for diagnosis because this con-
dition has developed in the presence of urate concentrations varying 
from 720–4800 μmol/L (12–80 mg/dL). The distinctive feature is the

3252 urinary  uric  acid  concentration.  In  most  forms  of  acute  renal  failure 
with decreased urine output, urinary uric acid content is either normal 
or reduced, and the ratio of uric acid to creatinine is <1. In acute uric 
acid nephropathy, the ratio of uric acid to creatinine in a random urine 
sample or a 24-h specimen is >1, and a value that high is essentially 
diagnostic.

HYPERURICEMIA AND METABOLIC 
SYNDROME
Metabolic syndrome (Chap. 408) is characterized by abdominal obe-
sity with visceral adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance due to insulin 
resistance  with  hyperinsulinemia,  hypertriglyceridemia,  increased 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreased high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol,  and  hyperuricemia.  Hyperinsulinemia  reduces  the  renal 
excretion  of  uric  acid  and  sodium.  Not  surprisingly,  hyperuricemia 
resulting  from  euglycemic  hyperinsulinemia  may  precede  the  onset 
of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and gout in 
individuals with metabolic syndrome.

TREATMENT
Hyperuricemia

ASYMPTOMATIC HYPERURICEMIA
Hyperuricemia is present in ~21% of the population and in at least 
25%  of  hospitalized  individuals.  The  vast  majority  of  hyperurice-
mic  persons  are  at  no  clinical  risk.  In  the  past,  the  association  of 
hyperuricemia with cardiovascular disease and renal failure led to 
the  use  of  urate-lowering  agents  for  patients  with  asymptomatic 
hyperuricemia. This practice is no longer recommended except for 
individuals receiving cytolytic therapy for neoplastic disease, who 
are treated with urate-lowering agents in an effort to prevent uric 
acid  nephropathy.  Because  hyperuricemia  can  be  a  component  of 
the metabolic syndrome, its presence is an indication to screen for 
and  aggressively  treat  any  accompanying  obesity,  hyperlipidemia, 
diabetes mellitus, or hypertension.

Hyperuricemic  individuals,  especially  those  with  higher  serum 
urate levels, are at risk for the development of gouty arthritis. How-
ever, most hyperuricemic persons never develop gout, and prophy-
lactic  treatment  is  not  indicated.  Furthermore,  neither  structural 
kidney  damage  nor  tophi  are  identifiable  before  the  first  attack. 
Reduced  renal  function  cannot  be  attributed  to  asymptomatic 
hyperuricemia  and  available  evidence  does  not  yet  support  treat-
ment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia to alter progression of renal 
dysfunction  in  patients  with  renal  disease.  An  increased  risk  of 
stone formation in those with asymptomatic hyperuricemia has not 
been established.

Thus, because treatment with specific antihyperuricemic agents 
entails  inconvenience,  cost,  and  potential  toxicity,  routine  treat-
ment  of  asymptomatic  hyperuricemia  cannot  be  justified  other 
than  for  prevention  of  acute  uric  acid  nephropathy.  In  addition, 
routine  screening  for  asymptomatic  hyperuricemia  is  not  recom-
mended. If hyperuricemia is diagnosed, however, the cause should 
be determined. Causal factors should be corrected if the condition 
is secondary, and associated problems such as hypertension, hyper-
cholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity should be treated. 
SYMPTOMATIC HYPERURICEMIA
See Chap. 372 for treatment of gout, including urate nephrosis. 
Nephrolithiasis  Antihyperuricemic therapy is recommended for 
the individual who has both gouty arthritis and either uric acid– or 
calcium-containing stones, both of which may occur in association 
with  hyperuricaciduria.  Regardless  of  the  nature  of  the  calculi, 
fluid ingestion should be sufficient to produce a daily urine volume 
>2 L. Alkalinization of the urine with sodium bicarbonate or ace-
tazolamide may be justified to increase the solubility of uric acid. 
Specific treatment of uric acid calculi requires reducing the urine 
uric acid concentration with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, such as 
allopurinol  or  febuxostat.  These  agents  decrease  the  serum  urate 

concentration  and  the  urinary  excretion  of  uric  acid  in  the  first   
24  h,  with  a  maximal  reduction  within  2  weeks.  Allopurinol  can 
be given once a day because of the long half-life (18 h) of its active 
metabolite,  oxypurinol.  In  the  febuxostat  trials,  the  generally  rec-
ommended dose of allopurinol (300 mg/d) was effective at achiev-
ing a target serum urate concentration <6.0 mg/dL (357 μmol/L) in 
<50% of patients; this result suggested that higher doses should be 
considered.  Allopurinol  is  effective  in  patients  with  renal  insuffi-
ciency, but the dose should be reduced. Allopurinol is also useful in 
reducing the recurrence of calcium oxalate stones in patients with 
gout  and  in  individuals  with  hyperuricemia  or  hyperuricaciduria 
who do not have gout. Febuxostat (40–80 mg/d) is also taken once 
daily, and doses do not need to be adjusted in the presence of mild 
to  moderate  renal  dysfunction.  Potassium  citrate  (30–80  mmol/d 
orally  in  divided  doses)  is  an  alternative  therapy  for  patients 
with  uric  acid  stones  alone  or  mixed  calcium/uric  acid  stones.  A 
xanthine  oxidase  inhibitor  is  also  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
2,8-dihydroxyadenine kidney stones. 
Uric  Acid  Nephropathy  Uric  acid  nephropathy  is  often  pre-
ventable,  and  immediate  appropriate  therapy  has  greatly  reduced 
the  mortality  rate.  Vigorous  IV  hydration  and  diuresis  with  furo-
semide dilute the uric acid in the tubules and promote urine flow 
to ≥100 mL/h. The administration of acetazolamide (240–500 mg 
every  6–8  h)  and  sodium  bicarbonate  (89  mmol/L)  IV  enhances 
urine alkalinity and thereby solubilizes more uric acid. It is impor-
tant to ensure that the urine pH remains >7.0 and to watch for circu-
latory overload. In addition, antihyperuricemic therapy in the form 
of allopurinol in a single dose of 8 mg/kg is administered to reduce 
the amount of urate that reaches the kidney. If renal insufficiency 
persists, subsequent daily doses should be reduced to 100–200 mg 
because oxypurinol, the active metabolite of allopurinol, accumu-
lates in renal failure. Despite these measures, hemodialysis may be 
required. Urate oxidase (rasburicase) can also be administered IV 
to prevent or to treat tumor lysis syndrome.

 ■ HYPOURICEMIA
Hypouricemia,  defined  as  a  serum  urate  concentration  <120  μmol/L 
(<2.0 mg/dL), can result from decreased production of urate, increased 
excretion  of  uric  acid,  or  a  combination  of  both  mechanisms.  This 
condition occurs in <0.2% of the general population and <0.8% of hos-
pitalized individuals. Hypouricemia causes no symptoms or pathology 
and therefore requires no therapy.

Most hypouricemia results from increased renal uric acid excretion. 
The finding of normal amounts of uric acid in a 24-h urine collection 
from  an  individual  with  hypouricemia  is  evidence  for  a  renal  cause. 
Medications  with  uricosuric  properties  (Table  417-1)  include  aspirin 
(at  doses  >2.0  g/d),  losartan,  fenofibrate,  x-ray  contrast  materials, 
and  glyceryl  guaiacolate.  Total  parenteral  hyperalimentation  can  also 
cause hypouricemia, possibly a result of the high glycine content of the 
infusion  formula.  Other  causes  of  increased  urate  clearance  include 
conditions such as neoplastic disease, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes melli-
tus, and inappropriate secretion of vasopressin; defects in renal tubular 
transport such as primary Fanconi syndrome and Fanconi syndromes 
caused  by  Wilson’s  disease,  cystinosis,  multiple  myeloma,  and  heavy 
metal  toxicity;  and  isolated  congenital  defects  in  the  bidirectional 
transport  of  uric  acid.  Hypouricemia  can  be  a  familial  disorder  that 
is  generally  inherited  in  an  autosomal  recessive  manner.  Most  cases 
are caused by a loss of function mutation in SLC22A12, the gene that 
encodes URAT-1, resulting in increased renal urate clearance. Individu-
als with normal SLC22A12 most likely have a defect in other urate trans-
porters. Although hypouricemia is usually asymptomatic, some patients 
suffer from urate nephrolithiasis or exercise-induced renal failure.

associated with clinical manifestations, some causing major morbidity

liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, have facilitated 
diagnosis.
 ■ PURINE DISORDERS
HPRT Deficiency  The  HPRT  gene  is  located  on  the  X  chromo-
some.  Affected  males  are  hemizygous  for  the  mutant  gene;  carrier 
females  are  asymptomatic.  A  complete  deficiency  of  HPRT,  the 
Lesch-Nyhan  syndrome,  is  characterized  by  hyperuricemia,  self- 
mutilative  behavior,  choreoathetosis,  spasticity,  and  mental  retarda-
tion.  A  partial  deficiency  of  HPRT,  the  Kelley-Seegmiller  syndrome, 
is  associated  with  hyperuricemia  but  no  central  nervous  system 
manifestations.  In  both  disorders,  the  hyperuricemia  results  from 
urate overproduction and can cause uric acid crystalluria, nephrolith-
iasis,  obstructive  uropathy,  and  gouty  arthritis.  Early  diagnosis  and 

appropriate  therapy  with  allopurinol  can  prevent  or  eliminate  all  the 
problems attributable to hyperuricemia without affecting behavioral or 
neurologic abnormalities.

Increased PRPP Synthetase Activity  Like the HPRT deficiency 
states,  PRPP  synthetase  overactivity  is  X-linked  and  results  in  gouty 
arthritis and uric acid nephrolithiasis. Neurologic hearing loss occurs 
in some families.

Adenine  Phosphoribosyltransferase  (APRT)  Deficiency  
APRT deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Affected 
individuals develop kidney stones composed of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine. 
Caucasians  with  the  disorder  have  a  complete  deficiency  (type  I), 
whereas  Japanese  individuals  have  some  measurable  enzyme  activity 
(type II). Expression of the defect is similar in the two populations, as is 
the frequency of the heterozygous state (0.4–1.1 per 100). Allopurinol 
treatment prevents stone formation.

Hereditary Xanthinuria  A deficiency of xan-
thine oxidase causes all purine in the urine to occur 
in the form of hypoxanthine and xanthine. About 
two-thirds  of  deficient  individuals  are  asymptom-
atic.  The  remainder  develop  kidney  stones  com-
posed of xanthine.

Myoadenylate  Deaminase  Deficiency  Pri-
mary  (inherited)  and  secondary  (acquired)  forms 
of  myoadenylate  deaminase  deficiency  have  been 
described.  The  primary  form  is  inherited  as  an 
autosomal  recessive  trait.  Clinically,  some  persons 
may have relatively mild myopathic symptoms with 
exercise or other triggers, but most individuals with 
this  defect  are  asymptomatic.  Therefore,  another 
explanation  for  the  myopathy  should  be  sought 
in  symptomatic  patients  with  this  deficiency.  The 
acquired  deficiency  occurs  in  association  with  a 
wide  variety  of  neuromuscular  diseases,  including 
muscular dystrophies, neuropathies, inflammatory 
myopathies, and collagen vascular diseases.

Adenylosuccinate  Lyase  Deficiency  Defi-
ciency  of  this  enzyme  is  due  to  an  autosomal 
recessive  trait  and  causes  profound  psychomotor 
retardation,  seizures,  and  other  movement  disor-
ders. All individuals with this deficiency are men-
tally retarded, and most are autistic.

 ■ PYRIMIDINE DISORDERS
The pyrimidine cytidine is found in both DNA and RNA; it is a com-
plementary base pair for guanine. Thymidine is found only in DNA, 
where  it  is  paired  with  adenine.  Uridine  is  found  only  in  RNA  and 
can pair with either adenine or guanine in RNA secondary structures. 
Pyrimidines  can  be  synthesized  by  a  de  novo  pathway  (Fig.  417-4) 
or  reused  in  a  salvage  pathway.  Although  >25  different  enzymes  are 
involved  in  pyrimidine  metabolism,  disorders  of  these  pathways  are 
rare. Seven disorders of pyrimidine metabolism have been discovered 
(Table 417-4), three of which are discussed below.

Orotic Aciduria  Hereditary orotic aciduria is caused by mutations 
in  a  bifunctional  enzyme,  uridine-5′-monophosphate  (UMP)  syn-
thase,  which  converts  orotic  acid  to  UMP  in  the  de  novo  synthesis 
pathway (Fig. 417-4). The disorder is characterized by hypochromic 
megaloblastic  anemia  that  is  unresponsive  to  vitamin  B12  and  folic 
acid,  growth  retardation,  and  neurologic  abnormalities.  Increased 
excretion of orotic acid causes crystalluria and obstructive uropathy. 
Replacement  of  uridine  (100–200  mg/kg  per  day)  corrects  anemia, 
reduces orotic acid excretion, and improves the other sequelae of the 
disorder.

Pyrimidine  5′-Nucleotidase  Deficiency  Pyrimidine  5′- 
nucleotidase catalyzes the removal of the phosphate group from pyrim-
idine  ribonucleoside  monophosphates  (cytidine-5′-monophosphate 
or UMP) (Fig. 417-4). An inherited deficiency of this enzyme causes 
hemolytic anemia with prominent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes. 
The  accumulation  of  pyrimidines  or  cytidine  diphosphate  choline  is 
thought to induce hemolysis. There is no specific treatment. Acquired 
pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase deficiency has been reported in lead poi-
soning and in thalassemia.

Dihydropyrimidine  Dehydrogenase  Deficiency  Dihydropy-
rimidine dehydrogenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway of 
uracil and thymine degradation (Fig. 417-4). Deficiency of this enzyme 
causes excessive urinary excretion of uracil and thymine. In addition, 
this deficiency causes nonspecific cerebral dysfunction with convulsive 
disorders, motor retardation, and mental retardation. No specific treat-
ment is available.

Medication  Effect  on  Pyrimidine  Metabolism  A  variety  of 
medications  can  influence  pyrimidine  metabolism.  The  anticancer 
agents  fluorodeoxyuridine  and  5-fluorouracil  and  the  antimicrobial 
agent  fluorocytosine  cause  cytotoxicity  when  converted  to  fluoro-
deoxyuridylate,  a  specific  suicide  inhibitor  of  thymidylate  synthase. 
Fluorocytosine must be converted to 5-fluorouracil to be effective. This 
conversion is catalyzed by cytosine deaminase activity. Fluorocytosine’s 
action  is  selective  because  cytosine  deaminase  is  present  in  bacteria 
and fungi but not in human cells. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase is 
involved in the degradation of 5-fluorouracil. Consequently, deficiency 
of this enzyme is associated with 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity.

Leflunomide,  which  is  used  to  treat  rheumatoid  arthritis,  inhibits 
de  novo  pyrimidine  synthesis  by  inhibiting  dihydroorotate  dehydro-
genase, resulting in an antiproliferative effect on T cells. Allopurinol, 
which inhibits xanthine oxidase in the purine metabolic pathway, also 
inhibits  the  activity  of  orotidine-5′-phosphate  decarboxylase,  a  step 
in  UMP  synthesis.  Consequently,  allopurinol  use  is  associated  with 
increased excretion of orotidine and orotic acid. There are no known 
clinical effects of this inhibition.

418 Lysosomal Storage Diseases

Robert J. Hopkin, Gregory A. Grabowski

Lysosomes are heterogeneous subcellular organelles containing specific 
hydrolases that allow selective processing or degradation of proteins, 
nucleic  acids,  carbohydrates,  and  lipids.  There  are  >50  different  lys-
osomal  storage  diseases  (LSDs),  classified  according  to  the  nature 
of  the  stored  material  (Table  418-1).  Although  all  are  rare  diseases, 
several  of  the  more  prevalent  disorders  are  reviewed  here:  Tay-Sachs 
disease,  Fabry  disease,  Gaucher  disease,  Niemann-Pick  disease,  the 
mucopolysaccharidoses,  Pompe  disease,  lysosomal  acid  lipase  defi-
ciency  (LALD),  Krabbe  disease,  and  CLN2-related  Batten  disease. 
LSDs  should  be  considered  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of  patients 
with neurologic, renal, or muscular degeneration and/or unexplained 
hepatomegaly,  splenomegaly,  cardiomyopathy,  or  skeletal  dysplasias 
and deformations. Physical findings are disease specific, and enzyme 
assays  or  genetic  testing  can  be  used  to  make  a  definitive  diagnosis. 
Although  the  nosology  of  LSDs  segregates  the  variants  into  distinct 
phenotypes, these are heuristic; in the clinic, each disease exhibits—to 
varying degrees—a spectrum of manifestations, from severe to atten-
uated variants.

PATHOGENESIS
Lysosomal biogenesis involves ongoing synthesis of lysosomal hydro-
lases,  membrane  constitutive  proteins,  and  new  membranes.  Lys-
osomes originate from the fusion of trans-Golgi network vesicles with 
late  endosomes.  Progressive  vesicular  acidification  accompanies  the 
maturation of these vesicles; this gradient facilitates the pH-dependent 
dissociation  of  receptors  and  ligands  and  also  activates  lysosomal 
hydrolases.  Lysosomes  are  components  of  the  lysosome/autophagy/
mitophagy  system  that  are  regulated  by  the  mTORC1  modulation  of 
the  transcription  factors  TFEB/TFE3.  This  regulation  is  disrupted  to 
varying degrees in specific tissues affected by individual LSDs.

Abnormalities  at  any  biosynthetic  step  can  impair  enzyme  activa-
tion  and  lead  to  an  LSD.  After  leader  sequence  clipping,  remodeling 
of complex oligosaccharides (including the lysosomal targeting ligand 
mannose-6-phosphate as well as high-mannose oligosaccharide chains 
of  many  soluble  lysosomal  hydrolases)  occurs  during  transit  through 
the  Golgi.  Lysosomal  integral  or  associated  membrane  proteins  are 
sorted to the membrane or interior of the lysosome by several differ-
ent  peptide  signals.  Phosphorylation,  sulfation,  additional  proteolytic 
processing,  and  macromolecular  assembly  of  heteromers  occur  con-
currently.  Such  posttranslational  modifications  are  critical  to  enzyme 
function, and defects can result in multiple enzyme/protein deficiencies.
The final common pathway for LSDs is the accumulation of specific 
macromolecules  within  selected  tissues  and  cells  that  normally  have 
a  high  flux  of  these  substrates.  The  majority  of  lysosomal  enzyme 
deficiencies  result  from  point  mutations  or  genetic  rearrangements

3258 at  a  locus  that  encodes  a  single  lysosomal  hydrolase.  However,  some 
mutations cause deficiencies of several different lysosomal hydrolases 
by alteration of the enzymes/proteins involved in targeting, active site 
modifications,  macromolecular  association,  or  trafficking.  Nearly  all 
LSDs are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders except for Hunter 
(mucopolysaccharidosis type II), Danon, and Fabry diseases, which are 
X-linked, and two autosomal dominant conditions causing Parry type 
neuronal  ceroid  lipofuscinosis  (CLN)  due  to  mutations  in  DNAJC5 
or  frontotemporal  dementia  and  CLN11  due  to  GRN  (progranulin) 
mutations.  Substrate  accumulation  leads  to  lysosomal  distortion/ 
dysfunction, which has significant pathologic consequences. In addi-
tion, abnormal amounts of metabolites may also have pharmacologic 
effects important to disease pathophysiology and propagation, partic-
ularly activation of the innate immune responses.

For many LSDs, the accumulated substrates are synthesized within 
particular tissue sites of pathology. Other diseases have greater exoge-
nous  substrate  supplies.  For  example,  substrates  are  delivered  by 
low-density lipoprotein receptor–mediated uptake in Fabry and LALD 
or by phagocytosis in Gaucher disease type 1. The threshold hypothesis 
refers to a level of enzyme activity below which disease develops. Small 
changes in enzyme activity near that threshold can lead to or modify 
disease. A critical element of this model is that enzymatic activity can 
be  challenged  by  changes  in  substrate  flux  based  on  genetic  back-
ground,  cell  turnover,  recycling,  or  metabolic  demands.  Thus,  a  set 
level of residual enzyme may be adequate for substrate in some tissues 
or cells but not in others. In addition, several variants of each LSD exist 
at  a  clinical  level.  These  disorders  therefore  represent  a  spectrum  of 
manifestations that are not easily dissociated into discrete entities. The 
molecular/genetic  bases  for  such  variations  have  not  been  elucidated 
in any detail.

There are European Medicines Agency (EMA) and U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) treatments available for a growing number 
of LSDs. The first was enzyme replacement therapy (ET) for Gaucher 
disease;  this  has  been  followed  by  additional  ETs,  but  subsequent 
developments  have  included  modified  enzyme  infusion,  substrate 
inhibition, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), pharmacologic 
chaperone  therapy  (which  uses  a  small  molecule  to  stabilize  enzyme 
produced by the mutated gene and allows it to function), intrathecal 
enzyme delivery, and gene therapy. The technical ability to intervene 
for most LSDs now exists but with highly variable impact. Significant 
additional research is needed to reach the goals of long-term survival 
with good function and quality of life.

SELECTED DISORDERS
 ■ TAY-SACHS DISEASE
About 1 in 30 Ashkenazi Jews is a carrier for Tay-Sachs disease (total 
hexosaminidase  A  [Hex  A]  deficiency),  resulting  from  α-chain  gene 
mutations.  The  infantile  form  is  a  neurodegenerative  disease  that 
results  in  death  in  infancy.  It  is  characterized  by  macrocephaly,  loss 
of  motor  skills,  increased  startle  reaction,  and  a  macular  cherry  red 
spot.  The  juvenile-onset  form  presents  as  ataxia  and  dementia,  with 
death by age 10–15 years. The adult-onset disorder is characterized by 
clumsiness in childhood; progressive motor weakness in adolescence; 
and  additional  spinocerebellar  and  lower-motor-neuron  signs  and 
dysarthria  in  adulthood;  intelligence  declines  slowly,  and  psychiatric 
disorders  are  common.  Screening  for  Tay-Sachs  disease  carriers  is 
recommended in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Sandhoff disease, 
due to a deficiency in both Hex A and Hex B resulting from defective 
β-chains, is phenotypically similar to Tay-Sachs disease with the addi-
tion of hepatosplenomegaly and bony dysplasias.

 ■ FABRY DISEASE
Fabry disease, an X-linked disorder and likely the most prevalent LSD, 
results  from  mutations  in  GALA,  which  encodes  α-galactosidase  A. 
The estimated prevalence of hemizygous males ranges from 1 in 40,000 
to  1  in  3500  in  selected  populations.  Females  are  expected  to  have  a 
higher  prevalence  of  mutations,  but  more  variable  manifestations.  In 
males, the disease manifests with angiokeratomas (telangiectatic skin 

lesions), hypohidrosis, corneal and lenticular opacities, acroparesthe-
sia,  and  progressive  disease  of  the  kidney,  heart,  and  brain  vascular 
systems.  Abdominal  pain,  recurrent  diarrhea,  and  acroparesthesias 
(debilitating  episodic  burning  pain  of  the  hands,  feet,  and  proximal 
extremities) may appear in childhood. In females, the overall manifes-
tations vary, except that kidney disease is uncommon. Angiokeratomas 
often appear in adolescence and are punctate, dark red to blue-black, 
flat or slightly raised, and usually symmetric; they do not blanch with 
pressure. They are often small and can be easily overlooked. They usu-
ally are most dense between the umbilicus and the knees—the “bathing 
suit area”—but may occur anywhere, including the mucosal surfaces. 
Angiokeratomas  also  occur  in  several  other  very  rare  LSDs.  Corneal 
and lenticular lesions, detectable on slit-lamp examination, may help 
in  establishing  a  diagnosis  of  Fabry  disease.  Acroparesthesia  can  last 
from minutes to days and can be precipitated by changes in tempera-
ture, exercise, fatigue, or fever. Abdominal pain can resemble that from 
appendicitis  or  renal  colic.  Proteinuria,  isosthenuria,  and  progressive 
renal dysfunction occur in the second to fourth decades; ~5% of male 
patients with idiopathic renal failure have GALA mutations. Hyperten-
sion,  left  ventricular  hypertrophy,  anginal  chest  pain,  and  congestive 
heart failure can occur in the third to fourth decades. About 1–3% of 
patients with idiopathic hypertrophic myocardiopathy have Fabry dis-
ease. Similarly, ~2–5% of patients with idiopathic stroke at 35–50 years 
of age have GALA mutations. Leg lymphedema occurs without hypo-
proteinemia. Death is due to cardiovascular, renal, or cerebrovascular 
disease in untreated patients. Variants with residual α-galactosidase A 
activity may have late-onset manifestations that are limited to the car-
diovascular system and resemble hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Cases 
with  predominant  cardiac,  renal,  or  central  nervous  system  (CNS) 
manifestations have been reported. Up to 70% of heterozygous females 
exhibit clinical manifestations. However, in females, heart disease is the 
most common life-threatening manifestation, followed in frequency by 
stroke and renal disease. In males, renal disease followed by cardiovas-
cular disease and stroke are most life-threatening.

Gabapentin  and  carbamazepine  diminish  chronic  and  episodic 
acroparesthesia.  Chronic  hemodialysis  or  kidney  transplantation 
can be lifesaving in patients with renal failure. Intravenous ET clears 
stored lipids from a variety of cells. More recently a chaperone ther-
apy  (migalastat)  that  stabilizes  the  residual  enzyme  made  by  the 
patient’s body has allowed oral therapy for some patients with ame-
nable mutations. Renal insufficiency, cardiac fibrosis, and stroke are 
irreversible;  therefore,  early  institution  of  therapy  provides  the  best 
opportunity  to  prevent  or  slow  the  progression  of  life-threatening  
complications.

 ■ GAUCHER DISEASE
Gaucher  disease,  a  panethnic  autosomal  recessive  disorder,  results 
from  defective  activity  of  acid  β-glucosidase;  ~600  GBA1  mutations 
have  been  described  in  such  patients.  Clinically,  disease  variants  are 
classified by the absence or presence and progression of primary CNS 
involvement.

Gaucher disease type 1 is a nonneuronopathic disease (i.e., absence 
of  early-onset  or  progressive  CNS  disease)  presenting  in  childhood 
to  adulthood  as  slowly  to  rapidly  progressive  visceral  disease.  About 
55–60%  of  patients  are  diagnosed  at  <20  years  of  age  in  white  pop-
ulations  and  at  even  younger  ages  in  other  groups.  This  pattern  of 
presentation is distinctly bimodal, with peaks at <10–15 years and at 
~25  years.  Younger  patients  tend  to  have  greater  degrees  of  hepato-
splenomegaly and accompanying blood cytopenias. In contrast, older 
patients have a greater tendency for chronic bone disease. Hepatosple-
nomegaly occurs in virtually all clinically identified patients and can 
be  minor  or  massive.  Accompanying  anemia  and  thrombocytopenia 
are  variable  and  are  not  directly  related  to  liver  or  spleen  volumes. 
Severe  liver  dysfunction  is  unusual.  Splenic  infarctions  can  resemble 
an acute abdomen. Pulmonary hypertension and alveolar Gaucher cell 
accumulation are uncommon but life-threatening and can occur at any 
age. GBA1 mutations in the heterozygous or homozygous states lead to 
a significantly increased lifetime risk for developing Parkinson disease. 
The basic mechanisms for this risk are unknown.

All  patients  with  Gaucher  disease  have  nonuniform  infiltration  of 
bone marrow by lipid-laden macrophages termed Gaucher cells. This 
phenomenon  can  lead  to  marrow  packing  with  subsequent  infarc-
tion, ischemia, necrosis, and cortical bone destruction. Bone marrow 
involvement  spreads  from  proximal  to  distal  in  the  limbs  and  can 
involve  the  axial  skeleton  extensively,  causing  vertebral  collapse.  In 
addition to bone marrow involvement, bone remodeling is defective, 
with  loss  of  total  bone  calcium  leading  to  osteopenia,  osteonecrosis, 
avascular  infarction,  and  vertebral  compression  fractures  with  spinal 
cord  involvement.  Aseptic  necrosis  of  the  femoral  head  is  common, 
as is fracture of the femoral neck. The mechanism by which diseased 
bone marrow macrophages interact with osteoclasts and/or osteoblasts 
to  cause  bone  disease  is  not  well  understood.  Chronic,  ill-defined 
bone pain can be debilitating and poorly correlated with radiographic 
findings. “Bone crises” are associated with localized excruciating pain 
and, on occasion, local erythema, fever, and leukocytosis. These crises 
represent  acute  infarctions  of  bone,  as  evidenced  in  nuclear  scans 
by  localized  absent  uptake  of  pyrophosphate  agents.  Decreased  acid 
β-glucosidase activity (0–20% of normal) in nucleated cells establishes 
the diagnosis. The enzyme is not normally present in bodily fluids. The 
sensitivity of enzyme testing is poor for heterozygote detection; molec-
ular testing by whole GBA1 sequencing is the standard. The disease fre-
quency varies from ~1 in 1000 among Ashkenazi Jews to <1 in 100,000 
in  other  populations;  ~1  in  12–15  Ashkenazi  Jews  carries  a  Gaucher 
disease allele. Four common mutations account for ~85% of the muta-
tions in that population of affected patients: p.N370S (also known as 
p.N409S),  84GG  (a  G  insertion  at  cDNA  position  84),  p.L444P  (also 
known as p.L483P), and IVS-2+1 (an intron 2 splice junction mutation).
Genotype/phenotype  studies  indicate  a  significant,  though  not 
absolute, correlation between disease type and severity and the GBA1 
genotype. The most common mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish pop-
ulation  (p.N370S)  shares,  either  homozygously  or  heteroallelically,  a 
100%  association  with  nonneuronopathic  or  type  1  Gaucher  disease. 
The N370S/N370S and N370S/other mutant allele genotypes are asso-
ciated with later-onset/less severe disease and with earlier-onset/severe 
disease, respectively. As many as 40% of individuals with the N370S/
N370S genotype do not present clinically. Other alleles include L444P 
(very  low  activity),  84GG  (null),  or  IVS-2  (null)  and  rare/private  or 
uncharacterized  alleles.  The  L444P/L444P  patients  frequently  have 
life-threatening  to  very  severe/early-onset  disease,  and  many,  though 
not all, develop CNS involvement in the first two decades of life.

Symptom-based  treatment  of  blood  cytopenias  and  joint  replace-
ment  surgeries  continue  to  have  important  roles  in  management. 
However,  regular  intravenous  ET  has  been  the  first-line  treatment 
for  significantly  affected  patients  and  is  highly  efficacious  and  safe 
in  diminishing  hepatosplenomegaly  and  improving  hematologic  val-
ues.  An  oral  substrate  reduction  therapy  (eliglustat  tartrate),  which 
inhibits  glycolipid  synthesis,  is  approved  as  a  first-line  therapy  for 
adults. Bone disease is decreased and can be prevented, but irreversible 
damage  cannot  be  reversed,  by  ET.  Adult  patients  may  benefit  from 
adjunctive  treatment  with  bisphosphonates  or  other  interventions  to 
improve  bone  density.  Adults  who  cannot  be  treated  with  enzyme, 
either  because  it  is  not  effective  or  because  they  have  developed  an 
allergy or other hypersensitivities to the enzyme, may receive substrate 
reduction therapy with either eliglustat tartrate or miglustat; the latter 
is approved as a second-line oral therapy.

Gaucher disease type 2 is a rare, severe, progressive CNS disease that 
leads to death by 2 years of age, depending on supportive care. Gaucher 
disease type 3 has highly variable manifestations in the CNS and viscera. 
It can present in early childhood with rapidly progressive, massive vis-
ceral disease and slowly progress to static CNS involvement that may not 
be evident by standard IQ evaluations; in adolescence with dementia; or 
in  early  adulthood  with  rapidly  progressive,  uncontrollable  myoclonic 
seizures  and  mild  visceral  disease.  Visceral  disease  in  type  3  is  nearly 
identical to that in type 1 but is generally more severe. Early CNS find-
ings may be limited to defects in lateral gaze tracking, which may remain 
static for decades. Cognitive degeneration can be slowly progressive or 
static. Type 3 is much more frequent among individuals of non–Western 
world descent. Visceral—but not CNS—involvement responds to ET.

 ■ NIEMANN-PICK DISEASES
Niemann-Pick  diseases  (acid  sphingomyelinase  deficiency  [ASMD]) 
are autosomal recessive disorders that result from defects in acid sphin-
gomyelinase (ASM). Types A and B are distinguished by the early age 
of onset and progressive CNS disease in type A. Type A typically has its 
onset in the first 6 months of life, with rapidly progressive CNS deteri-
oration, spasticity, failure to thrive, and massive hepatosplenomegaly. 
Type B has a later, more variable onset and is characterized by a pro-
gression of hepatosplenomegaly, with eventual development of cirrho-
sis  and  hepatic  parenchymal  and  Kupffer  cell  replacement  by  foam 
cells filled with sphingomyelin. Affected patients develop progressive 
pulmonary disease with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and a reticular infiltra-
tive pattern on chest x-ray. Foam cells are present in alveoli, lymphatic 
vessels, and pulmonary arteries. Progressive hepatic or lung disease can 
lead to death in adolescence or early adulthood. The “type B” pheno-
type includes some patients with slowly progressive CNS involvement.
The  diagnosis  is  established  by  markedly  decreased  (1–10%  of 
normal) ASM activity in nucleated cells. There is no approved specific 
treatment for Niemann-Pick disease, but intravenous ET clinical trials 
are in phase 3. The efficacies of hepatic transplant (HT) or bone mar-
row  transplantation  (BMT)  are  not  established.  More  complications 
than  expected  have  occurred  with  these  interventions  due  to  either 
(1)  recurrence  of  hepatic  disease  in  the  transplant  following  HT  by 
repopulation of bone marrow–derived ASM-deficient myeloid cells or 
(2) lack of clearance of sphingomyelin in hepatocytes by ASM cross- 
correction following the BMT of ASM-normal bone marrow stem cells.
Niemann-Pick  C  diseases  are  progressive  CNS  diseases  due  to 
mutations  in  either  NPC1  or  NPC2  mutations  in  either,  lysosomal 
proteins  involved  in  cholesterol  and  selected  sphingolipid  transport 
out of the lysosome. They can present with liver or splenic disease, but 
their major manifestations are progressive CNS disease over one to two 
decades.  Treatment  with  substrate  inhibition  agents  (e.g.,  miglustat) 
has shown minor CNS effects, and substrate depletion with cyclodex-
trin is in clinical trials for NPC1 disease.

 ■ MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSES
Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an autosomal recessive disor-
der caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase. The spectrum of involve-
ment  traditionally  has  been  divided  into  three  categories:  (1)  Hurler 
disease  (MPS  I  H)  for  severe  deficiency  with  neurodegeneration,  (2) 
Scheie  disease  (MPS  I  S)  for  later-onset  disease  without  neurologic 
involvement  and  with  relatively  less  severe  disease  in  other  organ 
systems,  and  (3)  Hurler-Scheie  syndrome  (MPS  I  H/S)  for  patients 
intermediate  between  these  extremes.  MPS  I  H/S  is  characterized 
by  severe  somatic  disease,  usually  without  major  overt  neurologic 
deterioration.  MPS  I  often  presents  in  infancy  or  early  childhood  as 
chronic  rhinitis,  clouding  of  the  corneas,  hepatosplenomegaly,  and 
progressive dysmorphia. As the disease progresses, nearly every organ 
system  can  be  affected.  In  the  more  severe  forms,  cardiac  and  respi-
ratory diseases become life threatening in childhood. Skeletal disease 
can be quite severe, resulting in very limited mobility. There are two 
current treatments for the MPS I diseases. HSCT is the standard treat-
ment for patients presenting at <2 years of age who appear to have or 
are  at  risk  for  neurologic  degeneration.  Because  early  diagnosis  and 
intervention are essential, MPS I has been added to the recommended 
newborn screen (NBS). HSCT results in stabilization of CNS disease 
and  reverses  hepatosplenomegaly.  It  also  beneficially  affects  cardiac 
and  respiratory  disease.  HSCT  does  not  eliminate  corneal  disease  or 
result  in  the  resolution  of  progressive  skeletal  disease.  ET  effectively 
addresses  hepatosplenomegaly  and  alleviates  cardiac  and  respiratory 
disease.  The  enzyme  does  not  penetrate  the  blood-brain  barrier  and 
does  not  directly  affect  CNS  disease.  ET  and  HSCT  appear  to  have 
similar effects on visceral signs and symptoms. ET poses a lower risk 
of  life-threatening  complications  and  may  therefore  be  advantageous 
for patients who have attenuated manifestations without CNS disease. 
A combination of ET and HSCT has been used, with ET initiated prior 
to  transplantation  in  an  attempt  to  reduce  the  disease  burden.  The 
experience with this approach is not well documented, but it appears to 
have advantages over HSCT alone. It is clear that HSCT has benefited

3260 patients. However, late cardiac and respiratory complications of MPS I 
are being reported including obstructive breathing requiring pressure 
support, cardiomyopathy, and/or valve disease. Regular follow-up for 
patients with MPS I is required throughout their lives even after suc-
cessful HSCT.

Hunter disease (MPS II) is an X-linked disorder due to deficiency 
in iduronate sulfate sulfatase and has manifestations similar to those of 
MPS I, including some variants with neurologic degeneration. There is 
no corneal clouding or other eye disease. Like MPS I, MPS II is clin-
ically variable, with CNS and non-CNS variants. HSCT has not been 
successful in treating CNS disease associated with MPS II. The FDA 
and EMA have approved ET for the visceral manifestations of MPS II.
MPS IV or Morquio syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condi-
tion (1 in 200,000–300,000) and is different than the other mucopoly-
saccharidoses in presenting as a spondyloepiphyseal skeletal dysplasia 
and  hyperextensibility  of  all  joints.  There  are  also  major  heart  and 
respiratory complications. This disorder often presents in childhood, 
but  the  age  of  onset  and  rate  of  progression  are  quite  variable.  Two 
variants,  type  A  and  type  B,  are  caused  by  deficiencies  in  N-acetyl- 
galactosamine-6-sulfatase  (GALNS)  and  an  acid  β-galactosidase, 
respectively.  A  recombinant  human  GALNS  ET  (elosulfase  alfa)  is 
approved  for  the  treatment  of  MPS  IVA,  making  it  is  essential  to 
confirm the specific enzyme diagnosis. Treatment has been shown to 
improve ambulatory mobility and decrease pain. There is no current 
specific treatment for MPS IVB.

ET  for  Maroteaux-Lamy  disease  (MPS  VI),  arylsulfatase  B  defi-
ciency, has received FDA approval as well as approval by similar agen-
cies in other countries. This very rare autosomal recessive disorder is 
characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, bone disease, heart disease, and 
respiratory compromise. Short stature is also an important manifesta-
tion. Visceral signs and symptoms are similar to those in MPS I; how-
ever, MPS VI is not associated with neurologic degeneration.

MPS  VII,  Sly  syndrome,  is  due  to  mutations  in  GUSB,  which 
encodes β-glucuronidase. Severe deficiency in this enzyme may pres-
ent with fetal hydrops, which can lead to stillbirth or perinatal demise. 
Other  patients  with  MPS  VII  may  present  later  with  short  stature, 
coarse  facial  features,  and  hepatosplenomegaly.  There  is  ET  for  this 
disorder (vestronidase alfa-vjbk).

 ■ POMPE DISEASE
Acid  maltase  (acid  α-glucosidase  deficiency)  due  to  GAA  mutation,  
also called Pompe disease, is the only LSD leading to primary glycogen 
storage. The classic severe infantile form presents with hypotonia, myo-
cardiopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. This variant is rapidly progres-
sive and generally results in death in the first year of life. However, as 
with other LSDs, there are early- and late-onset forms of this disorder.
The late-onset variants may be as common as 1 in 40,000; patients 
typically present with a slowly progressive myopathy that may resemble 
limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Respiratory insufficiency may be the 
presenting sign or may develop with advancing disease. In late stages of 
the disease, patients may require mechanical ventilation, report swal-
lowing difficulties, and experience loss of bowel and bladder control. 
Myocardiopathy is not usually present in late-onset variants of Pompe 
disease.

The FDA, EMA, and similar agencies have approved ET for Pompe 
disease patients of all ages. This treatment clearly prolongs life in the 
infantile  form,  consistently  resulting  in  improved  cardiac  function. 
Respiratory function is also improved in most treated infants if insti-
tuted before age 6 months. Some infants demonstrate marked improve-
ment in motor functions, while others have minor changes in muscle 
tone or strength. Recently, several states have instituted NBS for Pompe 
disease. In addition, newer protocols for treatment with methotrexate 
and  rituximab  have  greatly  decreased  antidrug  antibody  formation. 
The  combination  of  NBS  and  immunomodulation  preceding  ET  has 
greatly improved therapeutic response and long-term survival. Preven-
tion of deterioration has been shown with GAA ET in the late-onset 
forms. Early intervention with acid α-glucosidase ET in such patients 
may limit or prevent deterioration, but very advanced disease will have 
significant irreversible components.

 ■ LYSOSOMAL ACID LIPASE DEFICIENCY
Wolman syndrome (now infantile-onset LALD) and cholesterol ester 
storage  disease  (now  childhood/adult-onset  LALD)  are  caused  by 
deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) due to autosomal recessive 
mutations  in  LIPA.  The  diagnosis  is  established  by  enzyme  or  gene 
analyses  of  LAL  or  LIPA  in  serum/plasma  or  nucleated  cells.  LAL 
hydrolyzes  cholesterol  esters  and  triglycerides  delivered  to  the  lys-
osome  via  the  LDLR  pathway.  Accumulation  of  these  in  the  tissues 
leads  to  progressive  organ  dysfunction  including  liver  disease,  intes-
tinal malabsorption, heart dysfunction, and other manifestations. The 
most  severe  form  presents  in  early  infancy  as  a  medical  emergency 
with  severe  failure  to  thrive,  vomiting,  and  hepatosplenomegaly.  The 
infantile-onset  LALD  patients  die  without  specific  treatment  by  age 
1  year  (median  age  of  death,  3.7  months).  Childhood/adult-onset 
LALD can have a variable age of initial presentation with nonspecific 
signs  but  often  involves  elevated  liver  enzymes,  nonalcoholic  fatty 
liver disease, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and varying severities of hepato-/
splenomegaly. Importantly, neither clinical variant manifests primary 
CNS disease. Disease progresses throughout life and may result in early 
(adolescence)  liver  cirrhosis  and  (early  adulthood)  atherosclerosis  or 
early  death  without  treatment.  Importantly,  statins  can  decrease  the 
hypercholesterolemia but do not alter the basic progressive tissue (e.g., 
liver) pathology. The majority of the later onset patients are evaluated 
by hepatology or lipidology physicians. ET for LALD has major effects 
in  reversing  disease  manifestations  and  was  approved  for  patients  at 
all ages by the EMA, FDA, and several other country agencies in 2015 
and 2016.

 ■ KRABBE DISEASE
Deficiency in galactocerebrosidase (GALC) causes Krabbe disease, an 
autosomal  recessive  neurodegenerative  disorder  due  to  mutations  in 
GALC. Krabbe disease is panethnic but quite rare. The early infantile 
form  presents  at  an  average  age  of  4  months  and  progresses  rapidly, 
with death at an average age of 18 months. Later onset forms also exist 
and have onsets and survival that are highly variable. The early-onset 
form presents with hyperirritability, feeding problems, fever, seizures, 
and  neurodegeneration.  Blindness,  hypotonia,  and  loss  of  voluntary 
movement develop over time. Later onset forms present with spasticity, 
ataxia, vision loss, and behavioral problems and progress to dementia 
and early death. There is no FDA-approved treatment, but early pre-
symptomatic HSCT has been used. This results in improved survival, 
but  neurologic  problems  are  still  common.  More  recently  studies  in 
mouse and dog models have used gene therapy with dramatic improve-
ment  in  both  neurologic  function  and  survival.  Human  studies  are 
being implemented.

 ■ NEURONAL CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS TYPE 2 
(NCL2 OR CLN2)
There  are  at  least  13  genes  that  have  been  associated  with  storage  of 
neuronal ceroid lipofuscin. One of these, CLN2, is due to mutations in 
TPP1 and deficiency in tripeptidyl peptidase 1. This autosomal reces-
sive neurodegenerative disorder typically presents between age 2 and 
4 years, most commonly with seizures, ataxia, myoclonus, and vision 
loss.  Motor  skill  losses  include  sitting,  walking,  speech,  and  feeding 
and lead to severe disability and eventually death at an average age of 
12  years.  Intellectual  disability  and  behavioral  problems  also  become 
increasingly  severe  with  age.  Most  affected  children  are  wheelchair 
bound  in  late  childhood,  and  survival  beyond  adolescence  is  rare. 
There are later onset patients, and there is significant clinical overlap 
between CLN2 and other CLNs; confirmation of the diagnosis by gene 
sequencing is essential. In 2017, the FDA/EMA approved treatment of 
CLN2, cerliponase alfa, an ET that is administered by intracerebroven-
tricular injection over several hours every 2 weeks. Administration of 
cerliponase alfa is facilitated by placement of an intracerebroventricu-
lar port to allow reliable access. Currently, this is the only approved ET 
that  is  intrathecally  administered.  CLN2  is  the  only  neuronal  ceroid 
lipofuscinosis that has a specific treatment. Several others are in pre-
clinical development.

419 Glycogen Storage  

Diseases and Other Inherited 
Disorders of Carbohydrate 
Metabolism
Priya S. Kishnani

Carbohydrate metabolism plays a vital role in cellular function by pro-
viding the energy required for most metabolic processes. The relevant 
biochemical  pathways  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  these  carbohy-
drates  are  shown  in  Fig.  419-1.  Glucose  is  the  principal  substrate  of 
energy metabolism in humans. Metabolism of glucose generates ATP 
through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The 
body  obtains  glucose  through  the  ingestion  of  polysaccharides  (pri-
marily starch) and disaccharides (e.g., lactose, maltose, and sucrose). 
Galactose  and  fructose  are  two  other  monosaccharides  that  serve  as 
sources  of  fuel  for  cellular  metabolism.  However,  their  role  as  fuel 
sources  is  less  significant  than  that  of  glucose.  Galactose  is  derived 
from lactose (galactose + glucose), which is the disaccharide found in 
milk products, and it is an important component of certain glycolipids, 
glycoproteins,  and  glycosaminoglycans.  Fructose  is  found  in  fruits, 
vegetables, and honey. Sucrose (fructose + glucose) is another dietary 
source of fructose and is a commonly used sweetener.

Glycogen, the storage form of glucose in animal cells, is composed 
of  glucose  residues  joined  in  straight  chains  by  α1-4  linkages  and 
branched  at  intervals  of  4–10  residues  by  α1-6  linkages.  Glycogen 
forms  a  treelike  molecule  and  can  have  a  molecular  weight  of  many 
millions. Glycogen may aggregate to form structures recognizable by 
electron  microscopy.  Defects  in  glycogen  metabolism  typically  cause 
an  accumulation  of  glycogen  in  the  tissues—hence  the  designation 
glycogen  storage  diseases  (GSDs).  The  accumulated  glycogen  can  be 
structurally normal or abnormal in the various GSDs. Defects in glu-
coneogenesis, glycolysis or pathways involving galactose and fructose 
metabolism usually do not result in glycogen accumulation.

Clinical  manifestations  of  the  various  disorders  of  carbohydrate 
metabolism  differ  markedly.  The  symptoms  range  from  minimally 
harmful to lethal. Unlike disorders of lipid metabolism, mucopolysac-
charidoses, or other storage diseases, many disorders of carbohydrate 
metabolism  have  been  managed  with  diet  therapy.  However,  diet 
therapy alone does not prevent long-term complications, and there is 
a need for definitive therapies. Genes responsible for inherited defects 
of carbohydrate metabolism have been cloned, and pathogenic variants 
have been identified. With the use of tools such as DNA sequencing 
panels, whole exome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing, new 
GSDs continue to be identified, and the phenotype of known disorders

continues to expand as is seen in the case of GSDs type II, III, and IX. 
Advances in the molecular basis of these diseases are now being used to 
improve diagnosis and management. Some of these disorders are can-
didates for enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, 
gene therapy, and other genomic tools, such as small interfering RNA 
(siRNA) technology and CRISPR genome editing technology.

Historically, the GSDs were categorized numerically in the order in 
which the enzymatic defects were identified. GSDs are also classified 
based  on  the  primary  organs  involved  (liver,  muscle,  and/or  heart) 
and clinical manifestations. In this chapter, the GSDs will be classified 
based on the organ involvement (Table 419-1). The overall frequency 
of all forms of GSDs is between 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 40,000 live births 
in the United States and Europe, and up to 1 in 10,000 worldwide for 
some GSDs. Most are inherited as autosomal recessive traits; however, 
phosphoglycerate  kinase  deficiency;  two  forms  of  liver  and  muscle 
phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency caused by mutations in PHKA2 
and  PHKA1  genes  respectively,  and  lysosomal-associated  membrane 
protein  2  (LAMP2)  deficiency  are  X-linked  disorders.  The  most 
common  childhood  disorders  are  glucose-6-phosphatase  deficiency 
(GSD type I), lysosomal acid α-glucosidase deficiency (GSD type II), 
debrancher enzyme deficiency (GSD type III), and liver PhK deficiency 
(GSD type IX). The most common adult disorder is myophosphorylase 
deficiency (GSD type V).

SELECTED LIVER GLYCOGENOSES
 ■ DISORDERS WITH HEPATOMEGALY  
AND HYPOGLYCEMIA
Type  I  GSD  (Glucose-6-Phosphatase  or  Translocase 
Deficiency,  Von  Gierke  Disease)  Type  I  GSD  is  an  autosomal 
recessive  disorder  caused  by  glucose-6-phosphatase  or  translocase 
deficiency in liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa. There are two sub-
types  of  GSD  I:  type  Ia,  in  which  the  glucose-6-phosphatase  enzyme 
is defective, and type Ib, in which the translocase that transports glu-
cose-6-phosphate  across  the  microsomal  membrane  is  defective.  The 
defects  in  both  subtypes  lead  to  inadequate  conversion  of  glucose-6-
phosphate  to  glucose  in  the  liver  and  thus  make  affected  individuals 
susceptible to fasting hypoglycemia.

CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FINDINGS  Persons with type I GSD may 
develop hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis during the neonatal period; 
however,  more  commonly,  they  exhibit  hepatomegaly  at  3–4  months 
of  age.  Hypoglycemia  and  lactic  acidosis  can  develop  after  a  short 
fast,  typically  when  infants  start  sleeping  through  the  night.  These 
children  usually  have  doll-like  facies  with  fat  cheeks,  relatively  thin 
extremities,  short  stature,  and  a  protuberant  abdomen  that  is  due  to 
massive  hepatomegaly.  The  kidneys  are  enlarged,  but  the  spleen  and 
heart  are  of  normal  size.  The  hepatocytes  are  distended  by  glycogen 
and fat, with large and prominent lipid vacuoles. Despite hepatomegaly, 
liver enzyme levels are usually normal or near normal. Easy bruising 
and  epistaxis  are  associated  with  prolonged  bleeding  time  as  a  result 
of  impaired  platelet  aggregation/adhesion  and/or  an  acquired  von 
Willebrand–like  disease.  Hyperuricemia  is  present.  Plasma  lipids 
abnormalities includes elevation of triglycerides, total and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, and phospholipids, compared to the low level 
of  high  density  cholesterol  (HDL).  Type  Ib  patients  have  additional 
findings of neutropenia and impaired neutrophil function. Therefore, 
these patients are prone to recurrent bacterial infections and chronic 
oral and intestinal mucosal ulceration, which leads to severe diarrhea 
and malnutrition.

LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS  Gout usually becomes symptomatic at 
puberty  as  a  result  of  long-term  hyperuricemia  in  untreated  patients. 
Puberty is often delayed. Some women with GSD I have polycystic ova-
ries and menorrhagia. Several reports of successful pregnancies suggest 
that  fertility  is  not  affected,  although  symptoms  may  be  exacerbated 
due  to  pregnancy-related  increases  in  renal  perfusion  and  maternal 
blood volume. Secondary to lipid abnormalities, there is an increased 
risk  of  pancreatitis.  Patients  with  GSD  I  may  be  at  increased  risk  for

starch 
is  used  for  treatment  of  both  GSD 
Ia  and  GSD  Ib.  Modified,  extended- 
release cornstarch products that are lon-
ger acting and better tolerated are avail-
able, which may help extend the duration 
of  euglycemia  and  improve  metabolic 
control. Treatment of complications with 
medications  may  be  necessary,  such 
as  citrate  supplementation  to  prevent 
and/or  treat  nephrocalcinosis,  allopu-
rinol  to  control  hyperuricemia,  HMG-
CoA  reductase  inhibitors  and  fibrate  to 
reduce  lipids,  as  well  as  angiotensin-
converting  enzyme  inhibitors  to  treat 
microalbuminuria.  Surgical  resection, 
percutaneous  ethanol  injections,  radio-
frequency  ablation  can  be  used  to  treat 
liver adenoma. Liver transplantation can 
be lifesaving for those with hepatic ade-
nomatous disease with the risk of malig-
nant  transformation,  rapid  growth  in 
size or number, and/or severe, poor met-
abolic  control.  Kidney  transplantation 
may be required in those with renal glo-
merular dysfunction progressing to renal 
failure.  Individuals  with  GSD  Ib  may 
require  further  intervention  due  to  the 
consequences  of  neutropenia,  such  as 
the  use  of  granulocyte  colony-stimulat-
ing factor. More recently, empagliflozin, 
renal  glucose  cotransporter  sodium 
glucose  cotransporter  2  (SGLT2),  has 
been  effectively  used  in  GSD  Ib  for  the 
treatment of neutrophil dysfunction and 
showed  improvement  of  wound  healing 
and  symptoms  of  inflammatory  bowel 
disease.

cardiovascular  disease  such  as  systemic  hypertension.  Pulmonary 
hypertension—although  rare—has  been  reported.  In  adult  patients, 
frequent fractures can occur, and radiographic evidence of osteopenia/ 
osteoporosis  can  be  found;  in  prepubertal  patients,  bone  mineral 
content is significantly reduced. By the second or third decade of life, 
many  patients  with  type  I  GSD  develop  hepatic  adenomas  that  can 
hemorrhage  and,  in  some  cases,  become  malignant.  End-stage  renal 
disease  is  a  serious  late  complication.  Almost  all  patients  aged  >20 
years  have  proteinuria,  and  many  have  hypertension,  kidney  stones, 
nephrocalcinosis,  and  altered  creatinine  clearance.  In  some  patients, 
renal function deteriorates and progresses to end-stage renal disease, 
requiring dialysis or transplantation.

DIAGNOSIS  Clinical  presentation,  hypoglycemia,  lactic  acidosis, 
hyperuricemia and abnormal lipids values suggest that a patient may 
have  GSD  I,  and  genetic  testing  provides  a  noninvasive  means  of 
reaching a definitive diagnosis for most patients with types Ia and Ib 
disease.  Historically,  a  definitive  diagnosis  required  a  liver  biopsy  to 
demonstrate the enzyme deficiency.

TREATMENT  The  first  line  of  treatment  in  GSD  I  is  avoidance  of 
fasting and frequent feedings. A diet high in complex carbohydrates 

Type  III  GSD  (Debrancher  Defi-
Limit  Dextrinosis)  
ciency, 
Type  III  GSD  is  an  autosomal  recessive 
disorder caused by a deficiency of glyco-
gen  debranching  enzyme.  Debranching 
and phosphorylase enzymes are respon-
sible for the complete degradation of gly-
cogen  into  glucose.  When  debranching 
enzyme  is  defective,  glycogen  breakdown  is  incomplete,  resulting  in 
abnormal glycogen accumulation with short outer chains, resembling 
limit dextrin. GSD III is mainly classified as (1) GSD IIIa, with liver, 
cardiac, and skeletal muscle involvement (~85% of cases), and (2) GSD 
IIIb, with primarily liver involvement (~15% of cases).
CLINICAL  AND  LABORATORY  FINDINGS  The  initial  presentation  of 
GSD  III  is  similar  to  that  of  GSD  I  with  hypoglycemia,  hepatomeg-
aly, hyperlipidemia, and short stature, occurring in infancy and early 
childhood.  Hypoglycemia  in  GSD  III  can  be  ketotic  or  non-ketotic. 
Patients with GSD III have elevated aminotransferase levels and nor-
mal concentrations of blood lactate and uric acid. Patients with GSD 
IIIa  also  have  a  variable  skeletal  myopathy  and  cardiomyopathy  that 
can present early. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels can sometimes be 
used to identify patients with muscle involvement, but normal levels do 
not rule out muscle enzyme deficiency. In most patients with GSD III, 
there is an apparent improvement in hepatomegaly with age; however, 
many patients present in late adulthood with progressive liver fibrosis, 
cirrhosis  progressing  to  liver  failure,  and  hepatocellular  carcinoma. 
Hepatic adenomas may occur, although less commonly than in GSD I. 
Left ventricular hypertrophy, significant scarring of the myocardium, 
and  life-threatening  arrhythmias  have  been  reported.  Patients  with

GSD IIIa may experience muscle weakness in early childhood that can 
become severe after the third or fourth decade of life, resulting in use of 
assistive devices and wheelchair dependence. Patients also experience 
exercise intolerance. The pattern of muscle weakness is variable, and 
both proximal and distal muscle weakness are seen. Peripheral neurop-
athy may become discernible later in life; however there are opposing 
views concerning the existence of peripheral neuropathy in GSD III. 
Individuals with GSD IIIa are at an increased risk of osteoporosis. In 
addition, polycystic ovaries are reported in female patients with GSD 
III, and some patients develop features of polycystic ovarian syndrome, 
such as hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles. Reports of successful 
pregnancy in women with GSD III suggest that fertility is normal.
DIAGNOSIS  Hypoglycemia is a presenting symptom in only about half 
of patients with GSD III, and therefore the diagnosis should be con-
sidered in patients with hepatomegaly and typical biochemical param-
eters. In the past, the diagnosis was confirmed by deficient or absent 
debranching enzyme activity in liver, skeletal muscle, or fibroblasts. In 
patients with GSD IIIb, enzyme activity is low in liver and normal in 
muscle. With the availability of molecular genetic testing, reliance on 
invasive tests such as liver and muscle biopsies is declining. DNA-based 
analyses now provide a noninvasive way of subtyping these disorders in 
most patients. Liver histology has distended hepatocytes due to glyco-
gen buildup; areas of periportal fibrosis are also noted very early in the 
disease course along with some fat infiltration.
TREATMENT  Debrancher  enzyme  deficiency  prevents  complete 
glycogenolysis  in  GSD  III,  but  gluconeogenesis  is  intact.  Hence,  a 
high-protein  diet  with  complex  carbohydrates  supplemented  with 

uncooked  cornstarch  in  small,  frequent  feedings  is  effective  in  pre-
venting  hypoglycemia.  Individuals  with  GSD  III  may  benefit  from 
dietary lipid manipulation, such as the implementation of a high-fat 
diet or a modified ketogenic diet or use of medium-chain triglyceride 
supplementation,  yet  careful  monitoring  of  liver  function,  morphol-
ogy, lipid profile and growth is necessary given the potential impact 
on  underlying  liver  disease.  Blood  ketones  and  glucose  should  be 
evaluated during times of stress. Liver and heart transplantation may 
be  considered  in  those  with  severe  hepatic  or  cardiac  involvement. 
Diet therapy is not effective in preventing the progression of hepatic 
disease, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy. Muscle disease continues to 
progress and is a significant unmet need for these patients.

Type  IX  GSD  (Liver  Phosphorylase  Kinase  Deficiency)  
Defects  of  PhK  cause  a  heterogeneous  group  of  glycogenoses.  The 
PhK enzyme complex consists of four subunits (α, β, γ, and δ). Each 
subunit  is  encoded  by  different  genes  (X  chromosome  as  well  as 
autosomes)  that  are  differentially  expressed  in  various  tissues.  PhK 
deficiency  can  be  divided  into  several  subtypes  on  the  basis  of  the 
gene/subunit  involved,  the  tissues  primarily  affected,  and  the  mode 
of inheritance.

The most common subtype is GSD IX α2 an X-linked liver PhK 
deficiency caused by pathogenic variants in the PHKA2 gene, which 
is also one of the most common liver glycogenoses. PhK activity may 
also be deficient in erythrocytes and leukocytes but is normal in mus-
cle. Typically, a child between the ages of 1 and 5 years presents with 
growth  failure  and  hepatomegaly.  Despite  delayed  onset  of  puberty 
and growth continuing well into late teenage years, children typically

PART 12Endocrinology and Metabolismattain  normal  adult  stature.  Fatty  liver  and  liver  fibrosis  have  been 
identified in some patients, including children. Cholesterol, triglycer-
ides, and liver enzymes levels are elevated. Fasting ketosis is a feature 
of the disease, yet is not seen in all patients. Lactic and uric acid levels 
are usually normal. Hypoglycemia may be mild in some but recurrent 
in  others.  Phenotypic  variability  is  being  increasingly  recognized, 
with  significant  disease  involvement  in  some  cases  of  the  X-linked 
form.  Liver  histology  shows  distention  of  hepatocytes  due  to  excess 
glycogen accumulation; fibrosis is also noted. It is recommended that 
patients be monitored for hepatic complications with regular CT or 
MRI scans. Though previously thought to be a mild disease, a broad 
clinical  spectrum  of  presentations  is  now  being  recognized  in  GSD 
IX,  with  more  severe  cases  coming  to  light,  even  in  the  X-linked 
form. Further research is needed to completely understand the nat-
ural history and long-term complications of the X-linked subtype of 
liver GSD IX.

Treatment  of  liver  GSD  IX  is  symptom-based.  Like  in  GSD  III, 
gluconeogenesis is intact in GSD IX. A high-protein diet with complex 
carbohydrates  in  small,  frequent  feedings  is  effective  in  preventing 
hypoglycemia. Blood ketones and glucose should be evaluated during 
times of stress. Liver transplantation may be considered in those with 
severe hepatic involvement.

Other subtypes of type IX liver GSD include GSD IX β and GSD IX 
γ2. Additional subtypes, GSD IX α1 and IX γ1, affect only muscle and 
are described in a later section. GSD IX β (GSD IXb) is an autosomal 
recessive  form  of  liver  and  muscle  PhK  deficiency  caused  by  PHKB 
pathogenic  variants.  Patients  with  GSD  IX  β  typically  present  with 
hepatomegaly.  They  exhibit  a  wide  clinical  spectrum  and  cannot  be 
distinguished based on clinical findings alone. GSD IX γ2 an autoso-
mal recessive form of liver PhK deficiency, is due to PHKG2 pathogenic 
variants. This is a severe form of GSD IX that often progresses to liver 
cirrhosis. GSD IX γ2 typically is a more severe phenotype, when com-
pared to GSD IX α2 and GSD IX β, with early liver cirrhosis and fibro-
sis.  Previously,  infants  with  severe  isolated  cardiomyopathy  and  low 
PhK activity in the heart and muscle were considered to have a subtype 
of GSD IX. However, there were no pathogenic variants in the genes 
encoding for the PhK subunits. This presentation was later considered 
to be a new syndrome, PRKAG2 syndrome, with a secondary decrease 
in PhK activity. The condition can be lethal because of massive glyco-
gen  deposition  in  the  myocardium.  Details  about  this  condition  are 
described under the section about PRKAG2 deficiency.

Type IV GSD (Branching Enzyme Deficiency, Amylopectinosis, 
Polyglucosan  Disease,  or  Andersen  Disease)  Type  IV  GSD 
is caused by deficiency of branching enzyme leading to accumulation 
of an abnormal glycogen with poor solubility. The disease is clinically 
heterogeneous, with multisystem organ involvement, yet the primary 
presentation may be characterized by manifestations in either liver or 
muscle; thus two main types—hepatic and neuromuscular—are recog-
nized. Individuals with the progressive hepatic form typically present 
in the first 18 months of life with failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, 
and  progressive  liver  cirrhosis  leading  to  death  in  early  childhood. 
Hypoglycemia in GSD IV is secondary to advanced liver disease and 
considered  a  late  finding.  Some  patients  may  develop  hepatocellular 
carcinoma.  These  patients  often  have  extrahepatic  manifestations 
involving the central and peripheral nervous system as well as cardiac 
and  skeletal  muscles.  The  neuromuscular  forms  of  the  disease  have 
four recognized subtypes: perinatal, congenital, childhood, and adult 
forms. The perinatal and congenital forms are lethal, and death occurs 
in  the  neonatal  period.  The  childhood  form  presents  with  myopathy 
or cardiomyopathy, with typical systemic findings. The adult form is 
known  as  adult  polyglucosan  body  disease  (APBD)  and  may  present 
with systemic involvement of the central and peripheral nervous sys-
tem characterized by gait abnormalities due to spastic paraplegia neu-
rogenic  bladder,  peripheral  neuropathy,  leukodystrophy,  autonomic 
dysfunction and cognitive impairment in the later stages of the disease. 
Life expectancy is shortened in APBD patients, yet there is a paucity 
of systematic long-term natural history studies. Definitive diagnosis of 
GSD  IV  requires  demonstration  of  pathogenic  variants  in  the  GBE1 

gene  or  branching  enzyme  deficiency  in  liver,  muscle,  cultured  skin 
fibroblasts, or leukocytes.

Liver transplantation may be performed for progressive hepatic fail-
ure. Extrahepatic manifestations including cardiac and nervous system 
involvement may occur after transplantation. Treatment for the adult 
form of GSD IV includes symptomatic support for gait abnormalities 
and bladder dysfunction, as well as periodic monitoring to uncover any 
new neurologic deficits.

Other  Liver  Glycogenoses  with  Hepatomegaly  and 
Hypoglycemia  These  disorders  include  hepatic  phosphorylase 
deficiency  (Hers  disease,  type  VI)  and  hepatic  glycogenosis  with 
Fanconi-Bickel  syndrome.  Patients  with  GSD  type  VI  can  have 
growth  retardation,  hyperlipidemia,  and  hyperketosis  in  addition  to 
hepatomegaly  and  hypoglycemia.  The  clinical  course  can  vary  from 
mild  to  severe.  Fanconi-Bickel  syndrome  is  caused  by  defects  in  the 
facilitative glucose transporter 2 (GLUT-2), which transports glucose 
and galactose in and out of hepatocytes, pancreatic cells, and the baso-
lateral membranes of intestinal and renal epithelial cells. Patients with 
Fanconi-Bickel  syndrome  have  increased  renal  clearance  of  glucose, 
amino  acids,  phosphate,  and  uric  acid  due  to  proximal  renal  tubular 
dysfunction, impaired glucose and galactose utilization, and accumu-
lation of glycogen in liver and kidney.

SELECTED MUSCLE GLYCOGENOSES
 ■ DISORDERS WITH MUSCLE-ENERGY 
IMPAIRMENT
Type  V  GSD  (Muscle  Phosphorylase  Deficiency,  McArdle 
Disease)  Type V GSD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
deficiency of muscle phosphorylase. McArdle disease is a prototypical 
muscle-energy disorder, as the enzyme deficiency limits ATP genera-
tion by glycogenolysis and results in glycogen accumulation.
CLINICAL  AND  LABORATORY  FINDINGS  There  can  be  a  broad,  het-
erogeneous spectrum of clinical presentations with the neonatal form, 
which is rapidly fatal at one extreme, and the classical form with myal-
gia, cramps, and myoglobinuria at the other. Symptom onset as late as 
the eighth decade has been reported. Patients typically develop muscle 
stiffness, pain, and weakness induced by exercise. The degree of mus-
cle involvement is variable among the symptomatic patients; however, 
the  exercise  intolerance  typically  worsens  over  time.  Asymptomatic 
individuals with absent muscle phosphorylase activity have also been 
identified due to elevated serum CK.

Symptoms  can  be  precipitated  by  (1)  brief,  high-intensity  activity, 
such as sprinting or carrying heavy loads; and/or (2) less intense but 
sustained  activity,  such  as  climbing  stairs  or  walking  uphill.  Most 
patients  can  engage  in  moderate  exercise,  such  as  walking  on  level 
ground,  for  long  periods.  Patients  often  exhibit  the  “second-wind” 
phenomenon,  in  which,  after  a  short  break  from  the  initiation  of 
strenuous physical effort, they are able to continue the activity without 
pain. This phenomenon is unique to GSD V and is due to the increase 
of blood glucose supply released from liver glycogen stores and fatty 
acid  oxidation  as  exercise  progresses.  Although  most  patients  expe-
rience episodic muscle pain and cramping as a result of exercise, 35% 
report permanent pain that seriously affects sleep and other activities. 
Burgundy-colored urine is reported after exercise, resulting from myo-
globinuria secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Acute renal failure can result 
from intense myoglobinuria after vigorous exercise.

In  rare  cases,  electromyographic  findings  may  suggest  inflamma-
tory  myopathy,  a  diagnosis  that  may  be  confused  with  polymyosi-
tis.  These  patients  may  be  at  risk  for  statin-induced  myopathy  and 
rhabdomyolysis.

At  rest,  the  serum  CK  level  is  usually  elevated;  after  exercise,  the 
CK level increases even more. Exercise leads to an increase in levels of 
blood ammonia, inosine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid; these abnormal-
ities reflect residues of accelerated muscle purine nucleotide recycling 
as  a  result  of  insufficient  ATP  production.  NADH  is  underproduced 
during physical exertion.

3266 DIAGNOSIS  Lack of increase in blood lactate and exaggerated blood 
ammonia elevations after an ischemic exercise test are indicative of a 
muscle glycogenosis and suggest a defect in the conversion of glycogen 
or  glucose  to  lactate.  This  abnormal  exercise  response,  however,  can 
also  occur  with  other  defects  in  glycogenolysis  or  glycolysis,  such  as 
deficiency  of  muscle  phosphofructokinase.  A  noninvasive,  nonische-
mic forearm exercise test has been developed. Although this test has 
high sensitivity, is easy to perform, and is cost-effective, the abnormal 
exercise  response  does  not  exclude  other  muscle  glycogenosis  and 
includes  some  risk.  The  cycle  test  detects  the  hallmark  heart  rate 
observed during the second-wind phenomenon. A diagnostic confir-
mation is established by demonstration of pathogenic variants in the 
myophosphorylase gene or by enzymatic assay in muscle tissue.

Treatment  for  muscle  phosphorylase  deficiency  consists  of  preex-
ercise  consumption  of  simple  carbohydrates  (e.g.,  sucrose  or  sports 
drinks) to protect muscles and improve exercise tolerance prior to the 
onset  of  the  second  wind.  Regular  exercise  at  moderate  intensity  is 
recommended to improve exercise capacity. Compared to patients who 
are  physically  inactive,  those  who  are  physically  active  are  known  to 
have improved cardiorespiratory fitness and a better long-term clinical 
course.  Additionally,  poor  bone  health  and  significantly  lower  lean 
mass have been observed in inactive patients.

Type  IX  GSD  (Muscle  Phosphorylase  Kinase  Deficiency)  
GSD  IX  α1  and  IX  γ1  are  muscle-specific  PhK  deficiency  caused  by 
pathogenic variants in the PHKA1 and PHKG1 genes and are inherited 
in an X-linked and autosomal recessive manner respectively. Patients 
with muscle PhK deficiency present from childhood to adulthood with 
symptoms  including  exercise  intolerance,  cramps  and  myoglobinuria 
with  exercise,  fatigue,  and  progressive  muscle  weakness  and  atrophy. 
Electromyographic  and  forearm  ischemic  exercise  test  findings  are 
typically normal. The heart and liver are not involved. Treatment for 
muscle  PhK  deficiency  may  include  physical  therapy  and  nutritional 
consultation to optimize glucose concentrations based on activity level.

 ■ DISORDERS WITH PROGRESSIVE SKELETAL 
MUSCLE MYOPATHY AND/OR CARDIOMYOPATHY
Pompe  Disease,  Type  II  GSD  (Acid  α-1,4  Glucosidase  
Deficiency)  Pompe  disease  is  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder 
caused  by  a  deficiency  of  lysosomal  acid  α-glucosidase,  an  enzyme 
responsible for the degradation of glycogen in the lysosomes. This dis-
ease is characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes 
as opposed to accumulation in cytoplasm (as in the other glycogenoses).

CLINICAL  AND  LABORATORY  FINDINGS  The  disorder  encompasses 
a range of phenotypes. Each includes myopathy but differs in the age 
of onset, extent of organ involvement, and clinical severity. The most 
severe is the classic infantile form, in which infants present with car-
diomyopathy at birth and develop a generalized muscle weakness with 
feeding difficulties, macroglossia, hepatomegaly, and congestive heart 
failure  due  to  the  rapidly  progressive  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy. 
Without  treatment,  patients  with  the  classic  infantile  form  do  not 
survive  beyond  2  years  of  life.  A  variant  form,  known  as  nonclassic 
infantile Pompe disease, also presents in the first year of life with less 
severe  cardiomyopathy  and  slower  disease  progression.  All  patients 
with an absence of cardiomyopathy in the first year of life are consid-
ered  to  have  the  late-onset  form.  Young  children  with  the  late-onset 
form  have  delayed  motor  milestones  and  difficulty  in  walking.  With 
disease progression, patients often develop proximal and later a distal 
muscle weakness, swallowing difficulties, and respiratory insufficiency. 
With  the  advent  of  newborn  screening  for  Pompe  disease,  delayed 
motor milestones and other musculoskeletal findings such as scapular 
winging and pelvic girdle weakness are being recognized as early as the 
first year of life in some babies with late-onset Pompe disease.

Adults  typically  present  between  the  second  and  seventh  decades 
of  life  with  slowly  progressive  myopathy  without  overt  cardiac 
involvement. The clinical picture is dominated by slowly progressive, 
predominantly  proximal  limb  girdle  muscle  weakness.  The  pelvic 
girdle, paraspinal muscles, and diaphragm are most seriously affected. 

Respiratory  symptoms  include  sleep  apnea,  sleep  disordered  breath-
ing,  decreased  forced  vital  capacity,  somnolence,  morning  headache, 
orthopnea, and exertional dyspnea. Respiratory failure causes signifi-
cant morbidity and mortality in the late-onset form. In rare instances, 
patients present with respiratory insufficiency as the initial symptom. 
Basilar artery aneurysms and dilation of the ascending aorta have been 
observed  in  patients  with  Pompe  disease.  Ptosis,  lingual  weakness, 
hypernasality,  speech  difficulties,  gastrointestinal  dysmotility,  and 
incontinence due to poor sphincter tone are now being recognized as 
part of the clinical spectrum. Small-fiber neuropathy, which presents 
with painful paresthesia or pins-and-needles sensations, is also seen in 
some patients with the late-onset form. Individuals with advanced dis-
ease often require some form of ventilatory support and are dependent 
on a walking aid or wheelchair.

Laboratory findings include elevated levels of serum CK, aspartate 
aminotransferase,  alanine  aminotransferase,  and  lactate  dehydro-
genase.  Levels  of  urine  glucose  tetrasaccharide  (Glc4),  a  breakdown 
product of glycogen, are elevated, especially on the severe end of the 
disease spectrum, and can be used as a biomarker to monitor disease 
progression  and  treatment  responsiveness.  In  the  infantile  form  of 
the disease, chest x-ray shows massive cardiomegaly, echocardiogram 
shows severely elevated left ventricular mass index, and electrocardio-
graphic findings include a high-voltage QRS complex and a shortened 
PR  interval.  Muscle  biopsy  shows  vacuoles  that  stain  positive  for 
glycogen; the muscle acid phosphatase level is increased, presumably 
from a compensatory increase of lysosomal enzymes. Electromyogra-
phy  reveals  myopathic  features,  with  irritability  of  muscle  fibers  and 
pseudomyotonic  discharges,  which  appears  early  in  the  paraspinal 
muscles. Serum CK is not always elevated in adults, and depending on 
the  muscle  biopsied  or  tested,  muscle  histology  or  electromyography 
may not be abnormal.
DIAGNOSIS  The confirmatory step for a diagnosis of Pompe disease 
is  enzyme  assay  demonstrating  deficient  acid  α-glucosidase  or  gene 
sequencing  with  two  pathogenic  variants  in  the  GAA  gene.  Enzyme 
activity  can  be  measured  in  muscle,  cultured  skin  fibroblasts,  or 
blood. The latter is increasingly being used and is very reliable when 
performed  in  laboratories  with  experience.  Prenatal  diagnosis  using 
variant analysis of DNA extracted from fetal cells obtained by amnio-
centesis  or  by  measuring  GAA  enzyme  activity  in  chorionic  villi  or 
amniocytes is available.

The  approval  of  enzyme  replacement  therapy  (ERT)  with  alglu-
cosidase  alfa  in  2006  has  changed  the  natural  history  and  clinical 
course of Pompe disease. Children with the most severe, classic infan-
tile form respond well to ERT and are living longer. Other adjunctive 
treatment options include dietary modifications, submaximal aerobic 
exercise, and respiratory muscle strength training. Early diagnosis with 
early  ERT  initiation  is  the  key  to  treatment  efficacy.  Gene  therapy  is 
under early-phase clinical study as another treatment modality.

Pompe disease is now part of the recommended uniform screening 
panel (RUSP) for newborns in the United States, and newborn screen-
ing  (NBS)  has  been  initiated  in  almost  half  of  all  states.  In  Taiwan, 
where  NBS  for  Pompe  disease  is  performed  routinely  for  all  infants, 
early disease detection and treatment initiation have led to better treat-
ment  outcomes  in  infantile  Pompe  patients.  Similar  evidence  is  also 
emerging in the United States.

Polyglucosan  Body  Myopathy-2,  Type  XV  GSD  This  is  an 
autosomal  recessive,  slowly  progressive  skeletal  myopathy  caused 
by  mutations  in  the  GYG1  gene  blocking  glycogenin-1  biosynthesis. 
GYG1 pathogenic variants result in a reduced or complete absence of 
glyogenin-1, which impacts its autoglycosylation and/or its interaction 
with  glycogen  synthase,  resulting  in  impaired  glycogen  synthesis. 
Affected  individuals  commonly  present  with  adult-onset  proximal 
muscle weakness prominently affecting the hip and shoulder girdles. 
The disease course is often progressive, with the most disabling muscle 
weakness  found  at  older  age.  Asymmetric  muscle  involvement  has 
been observed in patients with GSD XV. Individuals with pathogenic 
variants in the GYG1 gene may also be identified without musculoskel-
etal manifestations. In these cases, cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure

have not been identified in patients with this disease.

GSD Mimicking Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy  Danon dis-
ease  is  an  X-linked  glycogen  storage  disorder  caused  by  pathogenic 
variants in the LAMP2 gene. This results in deficiency of lysosomal- 
associated  membrane  protein  2  (LAMP2),  leading  to  defective 
autophagosomal-lysosomal  fusion  and  excessive  accumulation  of 
autophagosomes  in  the  heart  and  skeletal  muscle.  Patients  present 
primarily with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but can be distinguished 
from having the usual causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by their 
electrophysiologic abnormalities, particularly ventricular preexcitation 
and  conduction  defects.  In  Danon  disease,  Wolff-Parkinson-White 
(WPW) syndrome pattern is five times greater in prevalence than in 
idiopathic and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, in a 
young male with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the presence of WPW 
pattern  on  electrocardiogram  strongly  suggests  Danon  disease.  The 
onset  of  cardiac  symptoms  such  as  chest  pain,  palpitations,  syncope, 
and cardiac arrest may occur between the ages of 8 and 15 years. Ocu-
lar  manifestations  are  often  underrecognized  and  include  peripheral 
pigmentary  retinopathy,  lens  changes,  and  abnormal  electroretino-
grams. Mild learning disability and cognitive deficits have been noted, 
as  well  as  speech  and  language  delays,  attention  deficits,  behavioral 
problems, and dysmetria. The prognosis for LAMP2 deficiency is poor, 
with  progressive  end-stage  heart  failure  early  in  adulthood.  Female 
carriers can also be symptomatic. Although the disease is less severe in 
females, cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, retinopathy and cognitive 
dysfunction  have  been  described.  Treatment  is  mainly  symptomatic, 
and  involves  management  of  heart  failure,  correction  of  conduction 
abnormalities, and physical therapy, among others. Cardiac transplan-
tation can be considered for refractory cases of heart failure. Neuropsy-
chological evaluations and special education support may be required 
for those with intellectual disabilities.

AMP-ACTIVATED  PROTEIN  KINASE  GAMMA  2  DEFICIENCY  (PRKAG2 
DEFICIENCY)  AMP-activated  protein  kinase  gamma  2  (PRKAG2) 
deficiency is caused by pathogenic variants in the PRKAG2 gene, which 
is important in many cellular ATP metabolic pathways. Affected indi-
viduals present with cardiac abnormalities including hypertrophic car-
diomyopathy and conduction system abnormalities, particularly WPW 
syndrome. The extent of cardiac involvement is variable and includes 
supraventricular  tachycardia,  sinus  bradycardia,  left  ventricular  dys-
function, or even sudden cardiac death in some cases. In addition to 
cardiac involvement, there is a broad spectrum of phenotypic presenta-
tions including myalgia, myopathy, and seizures. Other manifestations 
include  developmental  delays,  hypotonia,  areflexia,  tremors,  feeding 
difficulties, frequent respiratory infections, and failure to thrive. Unlike 
Danon disease, cardiomyopathy due to PRKAG2 pathogenic variants is 
compatible with longer-term survival except for a congenital form that 
presents in early infancy with a rapid fatal course. PRKAG2 syndrome 
should be considered as a differential diagnosis in infants presenting 
with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In rare instances, PRKAG2 
patients may be misdiagnosed as having infantile Pompe disease due 
to phenotypical similarity. Treatment is usually symptomatic and sup-
portive, as in Danon disease. Heart transplantation has been suggested 
as a preventive measure for noncongenital PRKAG2 deficiency.

SELECTED DISORDERS OF GALACTOSE 
METABOLISM
“Classic” galactosemia is caused by galactose 1-phosphate uridyltrans-
ferase (GALT) deficiency with a GALT enzyme activity that is absent or 
barely detectable. It is a serious disease with an incidence of 1 in 60,000 
and an early onset of symptoms. The newborn infant normally receives 
up to 40% of caloric intake as lactose (glucose + galactose). Without the 
transferase,  the  infant  is  unable  to  metabolize  galactose  1-phosphate 
(Fig.  419-1),  which  consequently  accumulates,  resulting  in  injury  to 
parenchymal cells of the kidney, liver, and brain. After the first feeding, 
infants can present with vomiting, diarrhea, hypotonia, jaundice, and 
hepatomegaly. There is an increased risk for susceptibility to infection 
with gram-negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli neonatal sepsis

in  galactosemic  infants,  often  with  the  onset  of  sepsis  preceding  the 
diagnosis of galactosemia. Additional findings include hypoglycemia, 
seizures, poor weight gain, cataracts, bleeding diathesis, renal failure, 
cerebral edema, and neutropenia.

Widespread NBS for galactosemia has identified these infants early 
and allowed them to be placed on dietary restriction. Elimination of 
galactose  from  the  diet  reverses  growth  failure  as  well  as  renal  and 
hepatic  dysfunction,  improving  the  prognosis.  However,  long-term 
developmental  outcomes  in  classic  galactosemia  are  poor,  with  a 
majority  of  patients  having  speech  delays  and  learning  disabilities 
that  increase  in  severity  with  age.  Impaired  motor  function  and  bal-
ance (with or without overt ataxia) is frequently seen. Ovarian failure 
manifesting  as  primary  or  secondary  amenorrhea  is  seen  in  females, 
with 80–90% or more of women reporting hypergonadotropic hypo-
gonadism.  While  most  female  patients  are  infertile  when  they  reach 
childbearing  age,  a  few  successful  pregnancies  have  been  reported. 
Adults on dairy-free diets have developed cataracts, tremors, and low 
bone density. The treatment of galactosemia to prevent long-term com-
plications remains a challenge.

Genotype  and  phenotype  relationship  is  well  established  in  galac-
tosemia with the Q188R mutation in homozygosity causing the above 
described classical presentation. Several variants appear to be protec-
tive,  particularly  the  Duarte  variant  (N314D)  and  the  p.Ser135Leu 
variant, which is more common in the African-American population. 
In addition to cataract in neonatal or childhood period, galactokinase 
deficiency may present with neonatal bleeding diathesis, encephalop-
athy and high levels of liver transaminases. Intellectual disabilities and 
developmental delay have been described. Deficiency of uridine diphos-
phate galactose 4-epimerase can be benign when the enzyme deficiency 
is  limited  to  blood  cells  but  can  be  as  severe  as  classic  galactosemia 
when the enzyme deficiency is generalized.

SELECTED DISORDERS OF FRUCTOSE 
METABOLISM
Fructokinase deficiency, or essential fructosemia (Fig. 419-1), causes a 
benign condition that is incidentally diagnosed from the presence of 
fructose as a reducing substance in the urine.

Deficiency of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (aldolase B; heredi-
tary fructose intolerance) is a serious disease in infants. These patients 
are healthy and symptom-free until fructose or sucrose (table sugar) is 
ingested  (usually  from  fruit,  sweetened  cereal,  or  sucrose-containing 
formula). Clinical manifestations may include jaundice, hepatomegaly, 
vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and convulsions. The incidence of celiac 
disease is higher among patients with hereditary fructose intolerance 
(>10%)  than  in  the  general  population  (1–3%).  Laboratory  findings 
show prolonged clotting time, hypoalbuminemia, elevation of bilirubin 
and aminotransferase levels, and proximal renal tubular dysfunction. If 
the disease goes undiagnosed and the deleterious intake of sugar con-
tinues,  hypoglycemic  episodes  recur,  and  eventually  death  can  occur 
from progressive liver and renal failure. The mainstay of treatment is 
the elimination of all sources of sucrose, fructose, and sorbitol from the 
diet. Once dietary control is established, liver and kidney dysfunction 
improve,  and  catch-up  growth  is  common;  intellectual  development 
is  usually  not  affected.  Over  time,  the  patient’s  symptom  intensity 
improves,  even  after  fructose  ingestion.  The  long-term  prognosis  is 
good.

Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase deficiency is characterized by childhood 
life-threatening  episodes  of  hypoglycemia,  acidosis,  hyperventilation, 
convulsions,  and  coma.  These  episodes  are  often  triggered  by  foods 
that contain fructose and include febrile infections and gastroenteritis 
when  oral  food  intake  is  low.  Hypoglycemic  episodes  can  occur  in 
neonatal period in nearly half of affected patients. Laboratory findings 
include  low  blood  glucose  levels,  high  lactate,  alanine  and  uric  acid 
levels,  and  metabolic  acidosis.  Renal  tubular  and  liver  functions  are 
normal, and aversion to sweets is usually not seen, unlike hereditary 
fructose intolerance. Treatment of acute episodes requires the correc-
tion of hypoglycemia and acidosis by IV infusion of dextrose. Further 
episodes  can  be  prevented  by  avoidance  of  fasting  and  elimination

3268 of  fructose  and  sucrose  from  the  diet.  A  complex  carbohydrate  such 
as  cornstarch,  which  provides  slow  and  sustained  levels  of  glucose, 
is useful for the long-term prevention of hypoglycemia. With proper 
treatment,  prognosis  is  good,  and  patients  who  survive  childhood 
develop normally.

GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
The GSDs and other inherited disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, 
although  individually  rare,  are  reported  in  most  ethnic  populations. 
The prevalent genetic variants for each disease may vary in different 
ethnic populations, but clinical symptoms are remarkably similar, and 
treatment  guidelines  apply  to  all.  Symptomatic  treatment  is  available 
for  these  disorders,  and  today,  advances  in  the  field  have  resulted  in 
more  definitive  diagnosis  and  treatment  approaches.  Availability  of 
NBS for Pompe disease has shown that the frequency of Pompe disease 
is much higher than previously estimated. This has allowed for early 
treatment  initiation  and  improved  outcomes.  NBS  also  mitigates  the 
long diagnostic delays and misdiagnoses often associated with Pompe 
disease. The lessons learned from Pompe disease have bearing on the 
other GSDs.

420 Inherited Disorders  
of Amino Acid Metabolism  
in Adults
Nicola Longo

Amino  acids  are  the  building  blocks  of  proteins  and  serve  as  neuro-
transmitters (glycine, glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid) or as precursors 
of  hormones,  coenzymes,  pigments,  purines,  or  pyrimidines.  Eight 
amino  acids,  referred  to  as  essential  (histidine,  isoleucine,  leucine, 
lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, valine, threonine, and tryptophan), 
cannot be synthesized by humans and must be obtained from dietary 
sources.  The  others  can  be  formed  endogenously.  Each  amino  acid 
has a unique degradative pathway  by  which  its  nitrogen  and  carbon 
components are used for the synthesis of other amino acids, carbohy-
drates, and lipids. Disorders of amino acid metabolism and transport 
(Chap.  421)  are  individually  rare—the  incidences  range  from  1  in 
10,000  for  cystinuria  or  phenylketonuria  to  1  in  200,000  for  homo-
cystinuria  or  alkaptonuria—but  collectively,  they  affect  perhaps  1  in 
2000 newborns. Almost all are transmitted as autosomal recessive traits.
The features of inherited disorders of amino acid catabolism are sum-
marized in Table 420-1. In general, these disorders are named for the 
compound that accumulates to highest concentration in blood (-emias) 
or  urine  (-urias).  In  the  aminoacidopathies,  the  parent  amino  acid  is 
found in excess, whereas products in the catabolic pathway accumulate 
in organic acidemias. Which compound(s) accumulates depends on the 
site of the enzymatic block, the reversibility of the reactions proximal to 
the lesion, and the availability of alternative pathways of metabolic “run-
off.”  Biochemical  and  genetic  heterogeneity  are  common.  Six  distinct 
forms  of  hyperphenylalaninemia  and  nine  forms  of  homocystinuria 
(with  or  without  methylmalonic  acidemia)  are  recognized.  Such  het-
erogeneity reflects the complexity of amino acid metabolism requiring 
multiple enzymes (gene products) for proper functioning.

The manifestations of these conditions differ widely (Table 420-1). 
Some, such as sarcosinemia, produce no clinical consequences. At the 
other  extreme,  complete  deficiency  of  ornithine  transcarbamylase  is 
lethal  in  the  untreated  neonate.  Central  nervous  system  (CNS)  dys-
function,  in  the  form  of  developmental  retardation,  seizures,  altera-
tions in sensorium, or behavioral disturbances, is present in more than 
half the disorders. Protein-induced vomiting, neurologic dysfunction, 
and  hyperammonemia  occur  in  many  disorders  of  the  urea  cycle. 
Metabolic  ketoacidosis,  often  accompanied  by  hyperammonemia,  is 
frequent in organic acidemias. Some disorders produce focal tissue or 
organ involvement such as liver disease, renal failure, cutaneous abnor-
malities, or ocular lesions.

Defects  in  the  synthesis  of  nonessential  amino  acids  (asparagine, 
glutamine, serine, proline) involve predominantly the brain with neu-
rologic symptoms, with other organs occasionally affected. Dominant 
mutations in at least one of these genes cause tremor or spastic para-
plegia in adults.

The  analysis  of  plasma  amino  acids  (by  ion-exchange  chromatog-
raphy  or  liquid  chromatography/tandem  mass  spectrometry),  urine 
organic acids (by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), and plasma 
acylcarnitine  profile  (by  tandem  mass  spectrometry)  is  commonly 
used to diagnose and monitor most of these disorders. The diagnosis 
is  confirmed  by  enzyme  assay  on  cells  or  tissues  from  the  patients 
or,  more  commonly,  by  DNA  testing.  The  clinical  manifestations  in 
many  of  these  conditions  can  be  prevented  or  mitigated  if  a  diagno-
sis  is  achieved  early  and  appropriate  treatment  (e.g.,  dietary  protein 
or  amino  acid  restriction  or  vitamin  supplementation)  is  instituted 
promptly. For this reason, newborn screening programs seek to iden-
tify  several  of  these  disorders.  Infants  with  a  positive  screening  test 
need additional metabolic testing (usually suggested by the newborn 
screening  program)  to  confirm  or  exclude  the  diagnosis.  Confirmed 
cases should be referred to a metabolic center for initiation of therapy.

The parents need to be counseled about the natural history of the dis-
ease and its recurrence risk in future pregnancies. In some cases, par-
ents need testing because they might have a disorder themselves (such 
as  glutaric  acidemia  type  1,  methylcrotonyl  coenzyme  A  carboxylase 
deficiency, primary carnitine deficiency, or fatty acid oxidation defects) 
since  mothers  with  these  conditions  can  sometimes  be  identified  by 
abnormal  newborn  screening  results  in  their  offspring.  Some  meta-
bolic  disorders  can  remain  asymptomatic  until  adult  age,  presenting 
only when fasting or severe stress requires full activity of affected met-
abolic pathways to provide energy.

Selected  disorders  that  illustrate  the  principles,  properties,  and 
problems  presented  by  the  disorders  of  amino  acid  metabolism  are 
discussed in this chapter.

THE HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIAS
The  hyperphenylalaninemias  (Table  420-1)  result  from  impaired 
conversion  of  phenylalanine  to  tyrosine.  The  most  common  and 
clinically  important  is  phenylketonuria  (frequency  1:16,500),  which 
is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an increased con-
centration  of  phenylalanine  and  its  by-products  in  body  fluids  and 
by severe intellectual disability if untreated in infancy. It results from 
reduced  activity  of  phenylalanine  hydroxylase.  The  accumulation  of 
phenylalanine inhibits the transport of other amino acids required for 
protein or neurotransmitter synthesis, reduces synthesis and increases 
degradation  of  myelin,  and  leads  to  inadequate  formation  of  norepi-
nephrine  and  serotonin.  Phenylalanine  is  a  competitive  inhibitor  of 
tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the pathway of melanin synthesis, resulting 
in hypopigmentation of hair and skin. Untreated children with classic 
phenylketonuria  are  normal  at  birth  but  fail  to  attain  early  develop-
mental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive 
impairment  of  cerebral  function.  Hyperactivity,  seizures,  and  severe 
intellectual  disability  are  major  clinical  problems  later  in  life.  Elec-
troencephalographic  abnormalities;  “mousy”  odor  of  skin,  hair,  and 
urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to develop 
hypopigmentation (compared to the family background) and eczema 
complete the devastating clinical picture. In contrast, affected children 
who are detected and treated at birth show none of these abnormalities.

TREATMENT
Phenylketonuria

To prevent intellectual disability, diagnosis and initiation of dietary 
treatment  of  classic  phenylketonuria  must  occur  before  the  child 
is  2  weeks  of  age.  For  this  reason,  newborns  in  North  America, 
Australia, and Europe are screened by determinations of blood phe-
nylalanine levels. Abnormal values are confirmed using quantitative 
analysis  of  plasma  amino  acids.  Dietary  phenylalanine  restriction 

is usually instituted if blood phenylalanine levels are >360 μmol/L. 
Treatment consists of a special diet low in phenylalanine and sup-
plemented with tyrosine since tyrosine becomes an essential amino 
acid in phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. With therapy, plasma 
phenylalanine  concentrations  should  be  maintained  between  120 
and 360 μmol/L. Dietary restriction should be continued and mon-
itored indefinitely. Compliance with the strict diet is often difficult 
as  patients  become  older;  increased  levels  of  phenylalanine  in 
adults can cause deficits in executive function or psychiatric symp-
toms.  Oral  tetrahydrobiopterin  (5–20  mg/kg  per  d),  an  essential 
cofactor  of  phenylalanine  hydroxylase,  can  reduce  phenylalanine 
levels  in  some  patients  with  phenylketonuria  in  conjunction  with 
a low-protein diet. Pegvaliase is a pegylated form of phenylalanine 
ammonia lyase, a bacterial enzyme that converts phenylalanine to 
trans-cinnamic  acid  and  ammonia.  This  injectable  drug  can  sub-
stantially reduce phenylalanine levels, allowing a normal diet. The 
bacterial origin of pegvaliase can cause immune reactions that limit 
its use in some patients with phenylketonuria.

Women with phenylketonuria can become pregnant. If maternal 
phenylalanine  levels  are  not  strictly  controlled  before  and  during 
pregnancy,  their  offspring  are  at  increased  risk  for  congenital 
defects and microcephaly (maternal phenylketonuria). After birth, 
these children have severe intellectual disability and growth retar-
dation.  Pregnancy  risks  can  be  minimized  by  continuing  lifelong 
phenylalanine-restricted  diets  and  assuring  strict  phenylalanine 
restriction 2 months prior to conception and throughout gestation.

 ■ THE HOMOCYSTINURIAS 
(HYPERHOMOCYSTEINEMIAS)
The  homocystinurias  are  nine  biochemically  and  clinically  distinct 
disorders (Table 420-1) characterized by increased concentration of the 
sulfur-containing amino acid homocysteine in blood and urine.

Classic  homocystinuria,  the  most  common  (frequency  1:450,000), 
results  from  reduced  activity  of  cystathionine  β-synthase  (Fig. 420-1), 
the  pyridoxal  phosphate–dependent  enzyme  that  condenses  homo-
cysteine  with  serine  to  form  cystathionine.  Most  patients  present 
between 3 and 5 years of age with dislocated optic lenses and intellec-
tual  disability  (in  about  half  of  cases).  Some  patients  develop  a  mar-
fanoid habitus and radiologic evidence of osteoporosis.

Life-threatening  vascular  complications  (affecting  coronary,  renal, 
and cerebral arteries) can occur during the first decade of life and are 
the  major  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality.  Classic  homocystinuria 
can  be  diagnosed  with  analysis  of  plasma  amino  acids,  showing  ele-
vated  methionine  and  presence  of  free  homocystine.  Total  plasma 
homocysteine is also extremely elevated (usually >100 μM). Elevated 
levels  of  methionine  can  be  also  detected  by  neonatal  screening,  but 
milder variants can be missed by this approach. Treatment consists of a

FIGURE 420-1  Pathways, enzymes, and coenzymes involved in the homocystinurias. Methionine transfers a methyl group during its conversion to homocysteine. Defects in 
methyl transfer or in the subsequent metabolism of homocysteine by the pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6)-dependent cystathionine β-synthase increase plasma methionine 
levels. Homocysteine is transformed into methionine via remethylation. This occurs through methionine synthase, a reaction requiring methylcobalamin and folic acid. 
Deficiencies in these enzymes or lack of cofactors is associated with decreased or normal methionine levels. In an alternative pathway, homocysteine can be remethylated 
by betaine:homocysteine methyl transferase.

special diet restricted in protein and methionine. In approximately half 
of patients, oral pyridoxine (25–500 mg/d) produces a fall in plasma 
methionine  and  homocysteine  concentration  in  body  fluids.  Folate 
and  vitamin  B12  deficiency  should  be  prevented  by  adequate  supple-
mentation. Betaine is also effective in reducing homocysteine levels by 
favoring its remethylation to methionine.

The  other  forms  of  homocystinuria  are  the  result  of  impaired 
remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. This can be caused by 
defective methionine synthase or reduced availability of two essential 
cofactors,  5-methyltetrahydrofolate  and  methylcobalamin  (methyl- 
vitamin B12). In contrast to cystathionine β-synthase, elevated levels of 
free homocystine are associated with low levels of methionine in the 
plasma amino acid profile in remethylation defects. Therapy in these 
cases  requires  administration  of  methylfolate,  hydroxycobalamin  (an 
activated form of vitamin B12), and betaine.

Hyperhomocysteinemia  refers  to  increased  total  plasma  concentra-
tion of homocysteine with or without an increase in free homocysteine 
(disulfide form). Hyperhomocysteinemia, in the absence of significant 
homocystinuria, is found in some heterozygotes for the genetic defects 
noted above or in homozygotes for milder variants. Changes of homo-
cysteine levels are also observed with increasing age; with smoking; in 
postmenopausal  women;  in  patients  with  renal  failure,  hypothyroid-
ism, leukemias, inflammatory bowel disease, or psoriasis; and during 
therapy with drugs such as methotrexate, nitrous oxide, isoniazid, and 
some  antiepileptic  agents.  Homocysteine  can  act  as  an  atherogenic 
and  thrombophilic  agent,  and  increased  total  plasma  homocysteine 
has  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  coronary,  cerebrovas-
cular,  and  peripheral  arterial  disease  as  well  as  for  deep-vein  throm-
bosis. In addition, hyperhomocysteinemia and folate and vitamin B12  
deficiencies have been associated with an increased risk of neural tube 
defects  in  pregnant  women  and  dementia  (Alzheimer’s  type)  in  the 
general  population.  Vitamin  supplements  are  effective  in  reducing 
plasma homocysteine levels in these cases, although there are limited 
effects on cardiovascular disease.

ALKAPTONURIA
Alkaptonuria  is  a  rare  (frequency  1:200,000)  disorder  of  tyrosine 
catabolism  in  which  deficiency  of  homogentisate  1,2-dioxygenase 
(also known as homogentisic acid oxidase) leads to excretion of large 
amounts  of  homogentisic  acid  in  urine  and  accumulation  of  oxi-
dized homogentisic acid pigment in connective tissues (ochronosis). 
Alkaptonuria may go unrecognized until middle life, when degener-
ative joint disease develops. Prior to this time, about half of patients 
might be diagnosed for the presence of urine that becomes dark with 
standing  or  addition  of  alkali.  Foci  of  gray-brown  scleral  pigment 
and generalized darkening of the concha, anthelix, and, finally, helix 
of the ear usually develop after age 30. Low back pain usually starts 
between 30 and 40 years of age.  Ochronotic  arthritis is heralded by 
pain, stiffness, and some limitation of motion of the hips, knees, and 
shoulders.  Acute  arthritis  may  resemble  rheumatoid  arthritis,  but 
small joints are usually spared. Pigmentation of heart valves, larynx, 
tympanic  membranes,  and  skin  occurs,  and  occasional  patients 
develop  pigmented  renal  or  prostatic  calculi.  Pigment  deposition 
in the heart and blood vessels leads to aortic stenosis necessitating 
valve  replacement,  especially  after  60  years  of  age.  The  diagnosis 
should be suspected in a patient whose urine darkens to blackness. 
Homogentisic acid in urine is identified by urine organic acid anal-
ysis. Ochronotic arthritis is treated symptomatically with pain med-
ications,  spinal  surgery,  and  arthroplasty  (Chap.  371).  Nitisinone 
(2-[2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl]-1,3-cyclohexanedione),  a 
drug  used  in  tyrosinemia  type  I,  at  low  dose  (10  mg/d)  reduces 
urinary  excretion  of  homogentisic  acid  and  delays  progression  and 
improves clinical signs of alkaptonuria.

UREA CYCLE DEFECTS
Excess  ammonia  generated  from  protein  nitrogen  is  removed  by  the 
urea  cycle,  a  process  mediated  by  several  enzymes  and  transporters 
(Fig. 420-2, Table 420-1). Complete absence of any of these enzymes 
usually  causes  severe  hyperammonemia  in  newborns,  while  milder

FIGURE 420-2  The urea cycle. This cycle, which is fully expressed only in the liver, forms urea starting from ammonia (NH3) derived from the nitrogen group of all amino acids. 
It requires many enzymes and mitochondrial transporters, any of which can be defective and may impair the function of the urea cycle. Ammonia escaping the urea cycle 
in periportal hepatocytes is conjugated with glutamate by glutamine synthase in perivenous hepatocytes to generate glutamine. ARG, arginase; ASA, argininosuccinic acid;

variants can be seen in adults. The accumulation of ammonia and glu-
tamine leads to direct neuronal toxicity and brain edema. Deficiencies 
in urea cycle enzymes are individually rare, but as a group, they affect 
~1:35,000 individuals. They are all transmitted as autosomal recessive 
traits,  with  the  exception  of  ornithine  transcarbamylase  deficiency, 
which is X-linked and the most frequent urea cycle defect. Hepatocytes 
of  females  with  ornithine  transcarbamylase  deficiency  express  either 
the normal or the mutant allele due to random X-inactivation and may 
be unable to remove excess ammonia if mutant cells are predominant.
Infants  with  classic  urea  cycle  defects  present  at  1–4  days  of  life 
with refusal to eat and lethargy progressing to coma and death. Milder 
enzyme deficiencies present with protein avoidance, recurrent vomit-
ing, migraine, mood swings, chronic fatigue, irritability, and disorien-
tation that can progress to coma. Some cases have presented with acute 
or chronic hepatic dysfunction. Females with ornithine transcarbamy-
lase deficiency can present at time of childbirth due to the combination 
of involuntary fasting and stress that favors catabolism. Administration 
of systemic corticosteroids or chemotherapy can precipitate hyperam-
monemia and can be fatal in previously asymptomatic individuals of 
any age. These patients may be misdiagnosed as having gastrointestinal 
disorders, food allergies, behavioral problems, or nonspecific hepatitis. 
The  diagnosis  requires  measurement  of  plasma  ammonia,  plasma 
amino acids, and urine orotic acid, useful for differentiating ornithine 
transcarbamylase deficiency from carbamyl phosphate synthase-1 and 
N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency. Increased plasma glutamine is 
seen with all urea cycle defects since ammonia not removed by the urea 
cycle in periportal hepatocytes is conjugated to glutamate by glutamine 
synthase in perivenous hepatocytes. Citrulline is low or undetectable 
in  proximal  defects  of  the  urea  cycle  (N-acetylglutamate  synthase, 
carbamylphosphate  synthase  1,  and  ornithine  transcarbamylase  defi-
ciency),  with  urine  orotic  acid  being  increased  only  in  ornithine 
transcarbamylase  deficiency.  Plasma  citrulline  is  markedly  increased 
in  argininosuccinic  acid  synthase  deficiency  (citrullinemia  type  1), 
with  a  milder  elevation  in  argininosuccinic  acid  lyase  deficiency  in 
the  presence  of  argininosuccinic  acid  (argininosuccinic  aciduria). 
Arginine  levels  are  usually  normal  to  low  in  these  conditions  and 
become  markedly  elevated  only  in  patients  with  arginase  deficiency. 
In addition to urea cycle defects, hyperammonemia can also be caused 
by liver disease from any cause and several organic acidemias and fatty 

acid oxidation defects (the latter two excluded by the analysis of urine 
organic acids and plasma acylcarnitine profile).

TREATMENT
Urea Cycle Defects

Therapy  is  aimed  at  stopping  catabolism  and  ammonia  produc-
tion  by  providing  adequate  calories  (as  IV  glucose  and  lipids  in 
the  comatose  patient)  and,  if  needed,  insulin.  Excess  nitrogen 
is  removed  by  IV  phenylacetate  and  benzoate  (0.25  g/kg  for  the 
priming dose and subsequently as an infusion over 24 h) that con-
jugate with glutamine and glycine, respectively, to form phenylacet-
ylglutamine and hippuric acid, water-soluble molecules efficiently 
excreted in urine. Arginine (200 mg/kg per d) becomes an essential 
amino acid (except in arginase deficiency) and should be provided 
intravenously  to  resume  protein  synthesis.  If  these  measures  fail 
to  reduce  ammonia,  hemodialysis  should  be  initiated  promptly. 
Chronic  therapy  consists  of  a  protein-restricted  diet,  phenylbu-
tyrate,  glycerol  phenylbutyrate  (a  liquid  drug  better  tolerated  by 
most  patients),  arginine,  or  citrulline  supplements,  depending  on 
the specific diagnosis. Oral carglumic acid can restore a functional 
urea  cycle  in  patients  with  N-acetylglutamate  synthase  deficiency 
and  renders  other  therapies  unnecessary.  Liver  transplantation 
should be considered in patients with severe urea cycle defects that 
are difficult to control medically.

Hyperammonemia  due  to  a  functional  deficiency  of  glutamine 
synthase can occur in patients receiving chemotherapy for different 
malignancies  or  undergoing  solid  organ  transplants.  It  can  also 
be seen with hepatic cirrhosis. Several of these patients have been 
successfully  rescued  from  hyperammonemia  using  the  protocol 
described above for urea cycle defects.

421 Inherited Defects of 
Membrane Transport
Nicola Longo

Specific  membrane  transporters  mediate  the  passage  of  amino  acids, 
oligopeptides, sugars, cations, anions, vitamins, water, and many other 
molecules across cellular membranes. They are encoded by members 
of  the  solute-carrier  gene  (SLC)  superfamily.  These  transporters  are 
located on the plasma membrane or intracellular organelles, and their 
cellular and tissue distribution in addition to the presence (or absence) 
of  redundant  transporters  explains  organ  involvement  and  possi-
ble  metabolic  disturbances.  The  first  transport  disorders  identified 
affected the gut or the kidney, but transport processes are essential for 
the normal function of every organ, but especially the brain and sen-
sory  organs  (Table  421-1).  Inherited  defects  impairing  the  transport 
of  selected  amino  acids  that  can  present  in  adults  are  discussed  here 
as  examples  of  the  abnormalities  encountered;  others  are  considered 
elsewhere in this text.
 ■ CYSTINURIA
Cystinuria (worldwide frequency of 1 in 7000) is an autosomal recessive 
disorder caused by defective transporters in the apical brush border of 
proximal renal tubule and small intestinal cells. It is characterized by 
impaired  reabsorption  and  excessive  urinary  excretion  of  the  dibasic 
amino  acids  lysine,  arginine,  ornithine,  and  cystine.  Because  cystine 
is poorly soluble, its excess excretion predisposes to the formation of 
renal, ureteral, and bladder stones. Such stones are responsible for the 
signs and symptoms of the disorder.

There are two variants of cystinuria. Homozygotes for both variants 
have high urinary excretion of cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine. 
Type A heterozygotes usually have normal urinary amino acid excre-
tion,  whereas  most  type  B  heterozygotes  have  moderately  increased 
urinary excretion of cystine that under some circumstances can result 
in  the  formation  of  kidney  stones.  The  gene  for  type  A  cystinuria 
(SLC3A1,  chromosome  2p16.3)  encodes  a  membrane  glycoprotein. 
Type  B  cystinuria  is  caused  by  mutations  in  SLC7A9  (chromosome 
19q13) that encodes the b0,+ amino acid transporter. The glycoprotein 
encoded by SLC3A1 favors the correct processing of the b0,+ membrane 
transporter and explains why mutations in two different genes cause a 
similar disease.

Cystine stones account for 1–2% of all urinary tract calculi and for 
~4–5% of stones in children. Cystinuria homozygotes regularly excrete 
2400–7200 μmol (600–1800 mg) of cystine daily. Since the maximum 
solubility of cystine in the physiologic urinary pH range of 4.5–7.0 is 
~1200  μmol/L  (300  mg/L),  cystine  needs  to  be  diluted  to  2.5–7  L  of 
water to prevent crystalluria. Stone formation usually manifests in the 
second or third decade but may occur in the first year of life. Symptoms 
and signs are those typical of urolithiasis: hematuria, flank pain, renal 
colic, obstructive uropathy, and infection (Chap. 318). Recurrent uro-
lithiasis may lead to progressive renal insufficiency.

Cystinuria is suspected after observing typical hexagonal crystals in 
the sediment of acidified, concentrated, chilled urine or after perform-
ing a urinary nitroprusside test. Quantitative urine amino acid analysis 

confirms the diagnosis of cystinuria by showing selective overexcretion 
of cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine. Quantitative measurements 
are important for differentiating heterozygotes from homozygotes and 
for following free cystine excretion during therapy.

Management  is  aimed  at  preventing  cystine  crystal  formation  by 
increasing urinary volume and by maintaining an alkaline urine pH. 
Fluid ingestion in excess of 4 L/d is essential, and 5–7 L/d is optimal. 
Urinary  cystine  concentration  should  be  <1000  μmol/L  (250  mg/L). 
The daily fluid ingestion necessary to maintain this dilution of excreted 
cystine should be spaced over 24 h, with one-third of the total volume 
ingested  between  bedtime  and  3  a.m.  Cystine  solubility  rises  sharply 
above pH 7.5, and urinary alkalinization (with potassium citrate) can 
be  therapeutic.  Penicillamine  (1–3  g/d)  and  tiopronin  (α-mercapto-
propionylglycine,  800–1200  mg/d  in  four  divided  doses)  undergo 
sulfhydryl-disulfide  exchange  with  cystine  to  form  mixed  disulfides. 
Because  these  disulfides  are  much  more  soluble  than  cystine,  phar-
macologic  therapy  can  prevent  and  promote  dissolution  of  calculi. 
Penicillamine can have significant side effects and should be reserved 
for patients who fail to respond to hydration alone or who are in a high-
risk category (e.g., one remaining kidney, renal insufficiency). When 
medical  management  fails,  shock  wave  lithotripsy,  ureteroscopy,  and 
percutaneous nephrolithotomy are effective for most stones. Open uro-
logic surgery is considered only for complex staghorn stones or when 
the patient has concomitant renal or ureteral abnormalities. Occasional 
patients progress to renal failure and require kidney transplantation.

 ■ LYSINURIC PROTEIN INTOLERANCE
This  disorder  is  characterized  by  a  defect  in  renal  tubular  reabsorp-
tion  and  intestinal  transport  of  the  three  dibasic  amino  acids  lysine, 
arginine, and ornithine but not cystine (lysinuric protein intolerance). 
Lysinuric protein intolerance is most common in Finland (1 in 60,000), 
southern Italy, and Japan, but is rare elsewhere. The transport defect 
affects basolateral rather than luminal membrane transport and causes 
secondary impairment of the urea cycle. The defective gene (SLC7A7, 
chromosome  14q11.2)  encodes  the  y+LAT  membrane  transporter, 
which associates with the cell-surface glycoprotein 4F2 heavy chain to 
form the complete sodium-independent transporter y+L.

Manifestations  are  related  to  impairment  of  the  urea  cycle  and  to 
immune  dysfunction  potentially  attributable  to  nitric  oxide  over-
production  secondary  to  arginine  intracellular  trapping  within 
macrophages. Affected patients present in childhood with hepatosple-
nomegaly,  protein  intolerance,  and  episodic  ammonia  intoxication. 
Older  patients  may  present  with  severe  osteoporosis,  impaired  renal 
function, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, various autoimmune disor-
ders,  and  an  incompletely  characterized  immune  deficiency.  Plasma 
concentrations of lysine, arginine, and ornithine are reduced, whereas 
urinary excretion of lysine and orotic acid is increased. Hyperammone-
mia may develop after the ingestion of protein loads or with infections, 
probably  because  of  insufficient  amounts  of  arginine  and  ornithine 
to  maintain  proper  function  of  the  urea  cycle.  Therapy  consists  of 
dietary protein restriction and supplementation of citrulline (2–8 g/d), 
a  neutral  amino  acid  that  fuels  the  urea  cycle  when  metabolized  to 
arginine and ornithine. Pulmonary disease responds to glucocorticoids 
or  recombinant  human  granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating 
factor  in  some  patients.  Women  with  lysinuric  protein  intolerance 
who become pregnant have an increased risk of anemia, toxemia, and 
bleeding  complications  during  delivery.  These  can  be  minimized  by 
aggressive  nutritional  therapy  and  control  of  blood  pressure.  Their 
infants can have intrauterine growth restriction but have normal neu-
rologic function.

 ■ CITRULLINEMIA TYPE 2 (CITRIN DEFICIENCY)
Citrullinemia  type  2  is  a  recessive  condition  caused  by  deficiency  of 
the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier AGC2 (citrin). A defect 
in  this  transporter  reduces  the  availability  of  cytoplasmic  aspartate  to 
combine  with  citrulline  to  form  argininosuccinate  (see  Fig.  420-1), 
impairing the urea cycle and decreasing the transfer of reducing equiva-
lents from the cytosol to the mitochondria through the malate-aspartate 
NADH  shuttle.  Mutations  in  the  SLC25A13  gene  on  chromosome

7q21.3  that  encodes  for  this  transporter  are  rare  in  Caucasians  but 
affect ~1:20,000 people with ancestry from Japan, China, and Southeast 
Asia with variable penetrance.

The  disease  can  present  in  children  with  neonatal  intrahepatic 
cholestasis,  failure  to  thrive,  and  dyslipidemia  but  usually  presents 
with  sudden  onset  between  20  and  50  years  of  age  with  recurring 
episodes of hyperammonemia with associated neuropsychiatric symp-
toms  such  as  altered  mental  status,  irritability,  seizures,  or  coma- 
resembling  hepatic  encephalopathy.  Some  patients  might  come  to 

medical  attention  for  hypertriglyceridemia,  pancreatitis,  hepatoma, 
or  fatty  liver  histologically  similar  to  nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis. 
Without therapy, most patients die with cerebral edema within a few 
years of onset. Episodes are usually triggered by medications (such as 
acetaminophen), surgery, alcohol consumption, or high sugar intake, 
with the latter conditions causing NADH production in the cytoplasm. 
NADH  is  not  generated  by  the  metabolism  of  proteins  or  fats,  and 
many individuals with citrullinemia type 2 spontaneously prefer foods 
such as meat, eggs, and fish and avoid carbohydrates.

Laboratory studies during an acute attack include elevated ammo-
nia,  citrulline,  and  arginine  with  low  or  normal  levels  of  glutamine 
(the latter is usually increased in classic urea cycle defects). Levels of 
galactose-1-phosphate in red blood cells are also increased, reflecting 
defective  transfer  of  reducing  equivalents  from  the  cytosol  to  mito-
chondria. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating mutations in 
the SLC25A13 gene. Liver transplantation prevents progression of the 
disease and normalizes biochemical parameters. A diet high in fats and 
proteins and low in carbohydrates with supplements of medium-chain 
triglycerides, arginine, and pyruvate is also effective in preventing fur-
ther episodes, at least in the short term.

 ■ HARTNUP DISEASE
Hartnup disease (frequency 1 in 24,000) is an autosomal recessive dis-
order  characterized  by  pellagra-like  skin  lesions,  variable  neurologic 
manifestations,  and  neutral  and  aromatic  aminoaciduria.  Alanine, 
serine,  threonine,  valine,  leucine,  isoleucine,  phenylalanine,  tyrosine, 
tryptophan, glutamine, asparagine, and histidine are excreted in urine 
in quantities 5–10 times greater than normal, and intestinal transport 
of  these  same  amino  acids  is  defective.  The  defective  neutral  amino 
acid transporter, B°AT1 encoded by the SLC6A19 gene on chromosome 
5p15, requires either collectrin or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for 
surface expression in the kidney and intestine, respectively.

The  clinical  manifestations  result  from  nutritional  deficiency  of 
the essential amino acid tryptophan, caused by its intestinal and renal 
malabsorption, and of niacin, which derives in part from tryptophan 
metabolism. Only a small fraction of patients with the chemical find-
ings of this disorder develop a pellagra-like syndrome, implying that 
manifestations  depend  on  other  factors  in  addition  to  the  transport 
defect. The diagnosis of Hartnup disease should be suspected in any 
patient with clinical features of pellagra who does not have a history of 
dietary niacin deficiency (Chap. 333). The neurologic and psychiatric 
manifestations  range  from  attacks  of  cerebellar  ataxia  to  mild  emo-
tional lability to frank delirium, and they are usually accompanied by 
exacerbations of the erythematous, eczematoid skin rash. Fever, sun-
light, stress, and sulfonamide therapy provoke clinical relapses. Diag-
nosis is made by detection of the neutral aminoaciduria, which does 
not occur in dietary niacin deficiency. Treatment is directed at niacin 
repletion and includes a high-protein diet and daily nicotinamide sup-
plementation (50–250 mg).

 ■ CYSTINOSIS
Cystinosis (frequency 1 in 100,000–200,000) is an autosomal recessive 
disorder  caused  by  mutations  in  the  CTNS  gene  encoding  the  lysoso-
mal  cystine/proton  transporter  (cystinosin).  In  this  condition,  cystine 
derived  from  protein  degradation  accumulates  inside  lysosomes  and 
forms  crystals  due  to  its  poor  solubility.  Depending  on  the  degree  of 
impairment of transporter function, three clinical forms are recognized. 

The  most  severe  form,  classic  nephropathic  cystinosis,  causes  renal 
Fanconi syndrome during the first year of life and, without treatment, 
evolves to renal failure usually by 10 years of age. Intermediate nephro-
pathic cystinosis leads to kidney failure between 15 and 25 years of age, 
whereas  photophobia,  caused  by  deposition  of  cystine  crystals  in  the 
cornea, is the only manifestation of ocular nonnephropathic cystinosis. 
Cystinosis is suspected by the identification of cystine crystals in the cor-
nea by slit lamp examination and diagnosed by measuring cystine con-
tent in white blood cells. DNA testing (including deletion analysis) of the 
CTNS gene can further confirm the diagnosis. Therapy consists in the 
administration of cysteamine that enters lysosomes, forms a mixed disul-
fide with cysteine, and is exported from the lysosome using a cationic 
amino  acid  transporter.  Oral  cysteamine  therapy  (60–90  mg/kg  per  d  
up to 2 g/d in adults, 0.2–0.3 g/m2 per d divided into two doses given 
every 12 h for the extended-release formulation) can delay renal failure 
and is more effective if started early in the course of the disease. Therapy 
with  cysteamine  reduces  intracellular  cystine  accumulation  in  white 
blood cells, but compliance with therapy is difficult due to the unpleasant 
odor of the drug and the need for frequent administration. Cysteamine 
eye  drops  can  relieve  photophobia.  Renal  replacement  therapy  with 
salts, alkali, and activated vitamin D is necessary for renal Fanconi syn-
drome. Cystine accumulation occurs in virtually all organs and tissues, 
causing additional complications such as hypothyroidism, hypohydrosis, 
diabetes, and delayed puberty in both males and females with primary 
hypogonadism  in  males.  Growth  hormone  replacement,  l-thyroxine 
for  hypothyroidism,  insulin  for  diabetes  mellitus,  and  testosterone 
for  hypogonadism  in  males  may  be  necessary.  Despite  therapy,  many 
patients with cystinosis progress to end-stage renal failure and require 
kidney transplantation. Late-onset complications include hepatomegaly 
and splenomegaly that occur in approximately one-third of subjects and 
a  vacuolar  myopathy  causing  weakness  (initially  involving  the  distal 
extremities),  swallowing  difficulties,  gastrointestinal  dysmotility,  and 
pulmonary  insufficiency.  Before  the  availability  of  cystine-depleting 
therapy and renal transplantation, the life span in nephropathic cysti-
nosis  was  <10  years.  With  current  therapies,  affected  individuals  can 
survive into the late forties with satisfactory quality of life.
