Disorders

236 Approach to the 

Patient with Possible 
Cardiovascular Disease
Joseph Loscalzo

 ■ THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM
Cardiovascular  diseases  comprise  the  most  prevalent  serious  disor-
ders  in  industrialized  nations  and  are  a  rapidly  growing  problem  in 
developing nations (Chap. 238). Age-adjusted death rates for coronary 
heart  disease  have  declined  by  two-thirds  in  the  past  four  decades  in 
the  United  States,  reflecting  the  identification  and  reduction  of  risk 
factors as well as improved treatments and interventions for the man-
agement  of  coronary  artery  disease,  arrhythmias,  and  heart  failure. 
Nonetheless, cardiovascular diseases remain the most common causes of 
death, responsible for one-third of all deaths, >800,000 deaths each year. 
Approximately one-fourth of these deaths are sudden. In addition, car-
diovascular diseases are highly prevalent, diagnosed in nearly half of the 
adult population. The growing prevalence of obesity (Chap. 402), type 2 
diabetes  mellitus  (Chap.  403),  and  metabolic  syndrome  (Chap.  408), 
which are important risk factors for atherosclerosis, now threatens to 
reverse the progress that has been made in the age-adjusted reduction 
in the mortality rate of coronary heart disease.

For many years, cardiovascular disease was considered to be more 
common in men than in women. In fact, cardiovascular disease is the 
leading  cause  of  all  deaths  among  women  and  men  (Chap.  398).  In 
addition, although the absolute number of deaths secondary to cardio-
vascular disease has declined over the past decades in men, this num-
ber has actually risen in women. Inflammation, obesity, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome appear to play more prominent 
roles  in  the  development  of  coronary  atherosclerosis  in  women  than 
in men. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is more frequently associated 
with dysfunction of the coronary microcirculation in women than in 
men. Exercise electrocardiography has a lower diagnostic accuracy in 
the prediction of epicardial obstruction in women than in men.

 ■ NATURAL HISTORY
Cardiovascular disorders often present acutely, as in a previously asymp-
tomatic person who develops an acute myocardial infarction (Chap. 275), 
or a previously asymptomatic patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(Chap.  259)  or  with  a  prolonged  QT  interval (Chap.  252)  whose  first 
clinical manifestation is syncope or even sudden death. However, the 
alert physician may recognize the patient at risk for these complications 
long  before  they  occur  and  often  can  take  measures  to  prevent  their 
occurrence.  For  example,  a  patient  with  acute  myocardial  infarction 
will  often  have  had  risk  factors  for  atherosclerosis  for  many  years. 
Had  these  risk  factors  been  recognized,  their  elimination  or  reduc-
tion  might  have  delayed  or  even  prevented  the  infarction.  Similarly, 
a  patient  with  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  may  have  had  a  heart 
murmur for years and a family history of this disorder. These findings 
could  have  led  to  an  echocardiographic  examination,  recognition  of 
the condition, and appropriate therapy long before the occurrence of a 
serious acute manifestation.

Patients with valvular heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyo-
pathy, by contrast, may have a prolonged course of gradually increasing 
dyspnea and other manifestations of chronic heart failure that is punc-
tuated by episodes of acute deterioration only late in the course of the 

disease. Understanding the natural history of various cardiac disorders 
is  essential  for  applying  appropriate  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  mea-
sures to each stage of the condition, as well as for providing the patient 
and family with the likely prognosis.
 ■ CARDIAC SYMPTOMS
The  symptoms  caused  by  heart  disease  result  most  commonly  from 
myocardial ischemia, disturbance of the contraction and/or relaxation 
of the myocardium, obstruction to blood flow, or an abnormal cardiac 
rhythm  or  rate.  Ischemia,  which  is  caused  by  an  imbalance  between 
the  heart’s  oxygen  supply  and  demand,  is  manifest  most  frequently 
as  chest  discomfort  (Chap.  14),  whereas  reduction  of  the  pumping 
ability  of  the  heart  commonly  leads  to  fatigue  and  elevated  intravas-
cular  pressure  upstream  of  the  failing  ventricle.  The  latter  results  in 
abnormal  fluid  accumulation,  with  peripheral  edema  (Chap.  41)  or 
pulmonary congestion and dyspnea (Chap. 37). Obstruction to blood 
flow,  as  occurs  in  valvular  stenosis,  can  cause  symptoms  resembling 
those  of  myocardial  failure  (Chap.  257).  Cardiac  arrhythmias  often 
develop suddenly, and the resulting symptoms and signs—palpitations  
(Chap. 43), dyspnea, hypotension, and syncope (Chap. 21)—generally 
occur abruptly and may disappear as rapidly as they develop.

Although dyspnea, chest discomfort, edema, and syncope are cardi-
nal manifestations of cardiac disease, they occur in other conditions as 
well. Thus, dyspnea is observed in disorders as diverse as pulmonary 
disease, marked obesity, and anxiety (Chap. 37). Similarly, chest dis-
comfort  may  result  from  a  variety  of  noncardiac  and  cardiac  causes 
other  than  myocardial  ischemia  (Chap.  14).  Edema,  an  important 
finding  in  untreated  or  inadequately  treated  heart  failure,  also  may 
occur with primary renal disease and in hepatic cirrhosis (Chap. 41). 
Syncope  occurs  not  only  with  serious  cardiac  arrhythmias  but  in  a 
number  of  neurologic  conditions  as  well  (Chap.  21).  Whether  heart 
disease is responsible for these symptoms frequently can be determined 
by  carrying  out  a  careful  clinical  examination  (Chap.  239),  supple-
mented  by  noninvasive  testing  using  electrocardiography  at  rest  and 
during exercise (Chap. 240), echocardiography, roentgenography, and 
other forms of myocardial imaging (Chap. 241).

Myocardial or coronary function that may be adequate at rest may 
be  insufficient  during  exertion.  Thus,  dyspnea  and/or  chest  discom-
fort  that  appear  during  activity  are  characteristic  of  patients  with 
heart disease, whereas the opposite pattern, that is, the appearance of 
these symptoms at rest and their remission during exertion, is rarely 
observed  in  such  patients.  It  is  important,  therefore,  to  question  the 
patient carefully about the relation of symptoms to exertion.

Many  patients  with  cardiovascular  disease  may  be  asymptomatic 
both  at  rest  and  during  exertion  but  may  present  with  an  abnormal 
physical  finding  such  as  a  heart  murmur,  elevated  arterial  pressure, 
or an abnormality of the electrocardiogram (ECG) or imaging test. It 
is  important  to  assess  the  global  risk  of  CAD  in  asymptomatic  indi-
viduals, using a combination of clinical assessment and measurement 
of  cholesterol  and  its  fractions,  as  well  as  other  biomarkers,  such  as  
C-reactive  protein,  in  some  patients.  Since  the  first  clinical  mani-
festation  of  CAD  may  be  catastrophic—sudden  cardiac  death,  acute 
myocardial infarction, or stroke in previous asymptomatic persons—it 
is mandatory to identify those at high risk of such events and institute 
further testing and preventive measures.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
As outlined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA), the elements 
of  a  complete  cardiac  diagnosis  include  the  systematic  consideration 
of the following:

1.  The  underlying  etiology.  Is  the  disease  congenital,  hypertensive, 

ischemic, or inflammatory in origin?

2.  The  anatomic  abnormalities.  Which  chambers  are  involved?  Are 
they hypertrophied, dilated, or both? Which valves are affected? Are 
they regurgitant and/or stenotic? Is there pericardial involvement? 
Has there been a myocardial infarction?

3.  The physiologic disturbances. Is an arrhythmia present? Is there evi-

dence of congestive heart failure or myocardial ischemia?

4.  Functional disability. How strenuous is the physical activity required 
to elicit symptoms? The classification provided by the NYHA has been 
found to be useful in describing functional disability (Table 236-1).

One example may serve to illustrate the importance of establishing 
a complete diagnosis. In a patient who presents with exertional chest 
discomfort,  the  identification  of  myocardial  ischemia  as  the  etiology 
is  of  great  clinical  importance.  However,  the  simple  recognition  of 
ischemia  is  insufficient  to  formulate  a  therapeutic  strategy  or  prog-
nosis until the underlying anatomic abnormalities responsible for the 
myocardial  ischemia,  for  example,  coronary  atherosclerosis  or  aortic 
stenosis,  are  identified  and  a  judgment  is  made  about  whether  other 
physiologic disturbances that cause an imbalance between myocardial 
oxygen  supply  and  demand,  such  as  severe  anemia,  thyrotoxicosis, 
or  supraventricular  tachycardia,  play  contributory  roles.  Finally,  the 
severity  of  the  disability  should  govern  the  extent  and  tempo  of  the 
workup and strongly influence the therapeutic strategy that is selected.
The establishment of a correct and complete cardiac diagnosis usually 
commences  with  the  history  and  physical  examination  (Chap.  239). 
Indeed, the clinical examination remains the basis for the diagnosis of a 
wide variety of disorders. The clinical examination may then be supple-
mented by five types of laboratory tests: (1) ECG (Chap. 240); (2) non-
invasive imaging examinations (chest roentgenogram, echocardiogram, 
radionuclide imaging, computed tomographic imaging, positron emis-
sion  tomography,  and  magnetic  resonance  imaging)  (Chap.  241);  (3) 
blood tests to assess risk (e.g., lipid determinations, C-reactive protein) 
or cardiac function (e.g., brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] [Chap. 257]); 
(4) occasionally, specialized invasive examinations (i.e., cardiac catheter-
ization and coronary arteriography [Chap. 242]); and (5) genetic tests to 
identify monogenic cardiac diseases (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
[Chap. 259], Marfan’s syndrome [Chap. 413], and abnormalities of car-
diac ion channels that lead to prolongation of the QT interval and an 
increase in the risk of sudden death [Chap. 246]). These genetic tests 
are becoming more widely available.
 ■ FAMILY HISTORY
In eliciting the history of a patient with known or suspected cardiovascu-
lar disease, particular attention should be directed to the family history. 
Familial clustering is common in many forms of heart disease. Mendelian 
transmission  of  single-gene  defects  may  occur,  as  in  hypertrophic  car-
diomyopathy (Chap. 259), Marfan’s syndrome (Chap. 413), and sudden 
death associated with a prolonged QT syndrome (Chap. 252). Premature 
coronary disease and essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
and  hyperlipidemia  (the  most  important  risk  factors  for  CAD)  are 
usually  polygenic  disorders.  Although  familial  transmission  may  be 
less obvious than in the monogenic disorders, it is helpful in assessing 
risk and prognosis in polygenic disorders, as well. Familial clustering of 
cardiovascular diseases not only may occur on a genetic basis but also 
may be related to familial dietary or behavior patterns, such as exces-
sive ingestion of salt or calories and cigarette smoking.

 ■ ASSESSMENT OF FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT
When  an  attempt  is  made  to  determine  the  severity  of  functional 
impairment in a patient with heart disease, it is helpful to ascertain the 

level of activity and the rate at which it is performed before symptoms 
develop.  Thus,  it  is  not  sufficient  to  state  that  the  patient  complains 
of dyspnea. The breathlessness that occurs after running up two long 
flights of stairs denotes far less functional impairment than do simi-
lar  symptoms  that  occur  after  taking  a  few  steps  on  level  ground.  In 
addition,  the  degree  of  customary  physical  activity  at  work  and  dur-
ing  recreation  should  be  considered.  The  development  of  two-flight 
dyspnea  in  a  well-conditioned  marathon  runner  may  be  far  more 
significant than the development of one-flight dyspnea in a previously 
sedentary person. The history should include a detailed consideration 
of  the  patient’s  therapeutic  regimen.  For  example,  the  persistence  or 
development  of  edema,  breathlessness,  and  other  manifestations  of 
heart failure in a patient who is receiving optimal doses of diuretics and 
other therapies for heart failure (Chap. 257) is far graver than are sim-
ilar manifestations in the absence of treatment. Similarly, the presence 
of  angina  pectoris  despite  treatment  with  optimal  doses  of  multiple 
antianginal drugs (Chap. 273) is more serious than it is in a patient on 
no therapy. In an effort to determine the progression of symptoms, and 
thus the severity of the underlying illness, it may be useful to ascertain 
what, if any, specific tasks the patient could have carried out 6 months 
or 1 year earlier that he or she cannot perform at present.

 ■ ELECTROCARDIOGRAM
(See also Chap. 240) Although an ECG usually should be recorded in 
patients with known or suspected heart disease, with the exception of 
the identification of arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, ventric-
ular  hypertrophy,  and  acute  myocardial  infarction,  it  generally  does 
not establish a specific diagnosis. The range of normal electrocardio-
graphic findings is wide, and the tracing can be affected significantly 
by  many  noncardiac  factors,  such  as  age,  body  habitus,  and  serum 
electrolyte  concentrations.  In  general,  electrocardiographic  changes 
should be interpreted in the context of other abnormal cardiovascular 
findings.

 ■ ASSESSMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH A HEART 
MURMUR
(Fig.  236-1)  The  cause  of  a  heart  murmur  can  often  be  readily  elu-
cidated  from  a  systematic  evaluation  of  its  major  attributes:  timing, 
duration,  intensity,  quality,  frequency,  configuration,  location,  and 
radiation  when  considered  in  the  light  of  the  history,  general  phys-
ical  examination,  and  other  features  of  the  cardiac  examination,  as 
described in Chap. 239.

The majority of heart murmurs are midsystolic and soft (grades I–
II/VI). When such a murmur occurs in an asymptomatic child or young 
adult  without  other  evidence  of  heart  disease  on  clinical  examination, 
it is usually benign and echocardiography generally is not required. By 
contrast, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography (Chap. 241) 
are  indicated  in  patients  with  loud  systolic  murmurs  (grades  ≥III/
VI), especially those that are holosystolic or late systolic, and in most 
patients with diastolic or continuous murmurs.

 ■ PITFALLS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
Increasing  subspecialization  in  internal  medicine  and  the  perfection 
of  advanced  diagnostic  techniques  in  cardiology  can  lead  to  several 
undesirable consequences. Examples include the following:

1.  Failure by the noncardiologist to recognize important cardiac man-
ifestations of systemic illnesses. For example, the presence of mitral 
stenosis,  patent  foramen  ovale,  and/or  transient  atrial  arrhythmia 
should  be  considered  in  a  patient  with  stroke,  or  the  presence  of 
pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale should be considered 
in a patient with scleroderma or Raynaud’s syndrome. A cardiovas-
cular examination should be carried out to identify and estimate the 
severity of the cardiovascular involvement that accompanies many 
noncardiac disorders.

2.  Failure  by  the  cardiologist  to  recognize  underlying  systemic  disor-
ders  in  patients  with  heart  disease.  For  example,  hyperthyroidism 
should be considered in an elderly patient with atrial fibrillation and 
unexplained  heart  failure,  and  Lyme  disease  should  be  considered 
in a patient with unexplained fluctuating atrioventricular block. A 
cardiovascular abnormality may provide the clue critical to the rec-
ognition of some systemic disorders. For example, an unexplained 
pericardial  effusion  may  provide  an  early  clue  to  the  diagnosis  of 
tuberculosis or a neoplasm.

3.  Overreliance  on  and  overutilization  of  laboratory  tests,  particu-
larly  invasive  techniques,  for  the  evaluation  of  the  cardiovascu-
lar  system.  Cardiac  catheterization  and  coronary  arteriography  
(Chap.  242)  provide  precise  diagnostic  information  that  may  be 
crucial in developing a therapeutic plan in patients with known or 
suspected CAD. Although a great deal of attention has been directed 
to these examinations, it is important to recognize that they serve 
to  supplement,  not  supplant,  a  careful  examination  carried  out 
with  clinical  and  noninvasive  techniques.  A  coronary  arteriogram 
should not be performed in lieu of a careful history in patients with 
chest  pain  suspected  of  having  ischemic  heart  disease.  Although 
coronary arteriography may establish whether the coronary arteries 
are obstructed and to what extent, the results of the procedure by 
themselves often do not provide a definitive answer to the question 
of whether a patient’s complaint of chest discomfort is attributable 
to coronary atherosclerosis and whether or not revascularization is 
indicated.

Despite  the  value  of  invasive  tests  in  certain  circumstances,  they 
entail some small risk to the patient, involve discomfort and substantial 
cost, and place a strain on medical facilities. Therefore, they should be 
carried out only if the results can be expected to modify the patient’s 
management.

 ■ DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT
The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most 
important  tasks  of  primary  health  care  givers  as  well  as  cardiologists. 
Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, 
such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessa-
tion, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 403).

After  a  complete  diagnosis  has  been  established  in  patients  with 
known  heart  disease,  a  number  of  management  options  are  usually 
available.  Several  examples  may  be  used  to  demonstrate  some  of  the 
principles of cardiovascular therapeutics:

1.  In  the  absence  of  evidence  of  heart  disease,  the  patient  should  be 
clearly  informed  of  this  assessment  and  not  be  asked  to  return  at 

intervals for repeated examinations. If there is no evidence of dis-
ease, such continued attention may lead to the patient’s developing 
inappropriate concern about the possibility of heart disease.

2.  If there is no evidence of cardiovascular disease but the patient has 
one or more risk factors for the development of ischemic heart dis-
ease (Chap. 273), a plan for their reduction should be developed and 
the patient should be retested at intervals to assess compliance and 
efficacy in risk reduction.

3.  Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with valvular heart 
disease that is anatomically severe should be evaluated periodically, 
every 6–12 months, by clinical and noninvasive examinations. Early 
signs of deterioration of ventricular function may signify the need 
for  surgical  treatment  before  the  development  of  disabling  symp-
toms, irreversible myocardial damage, and excessive risk of surgical 
treatment (Chap. 261).

4.  In  patients  with  CAD  (Chap.  273),  available  practice  guidelines 
should be considered in the decision on the form of treatment (med-
ical,  percutaneous  coronary  intervention,  or  surgical  revasculariza-
tion). Mechanical revascularization may be employed too frequently 
in  the  United  States  and  too  infrequently  in  Eastern  Europe  and 
developing nations. The mere presence of angina pectoris and/or the 
demonstration of critical coronary arterial narrowing at angiography 
should not reflexively evoke a decision to treat the patient by revascu-
larization. Instead, these interventions should be limited to patients 
with CAD whose angina has not responded adequately to medical 
treatment or in whom revascularization has been shown to improve 
the  natural  history  (e.g.,  acute  coronary  syndrome  or  multivessel 
CAD with left ventricular dysfunction).

DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY OF THE 
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
The heart forms early during embryogenesis (Fig. 237-1), circulating 
blood, nutrients, molecular signals, and oxygen to the other developing 
organs while continuing to grow and undergo complex morphogenetic 
changes. Early cardiac progenitors arise within crescent-shaped fields 
of  lateral  splanchnic  mesoderm  under  the  influence  of  multiple  cues 
and migrate to the midline to form the linear heart tube: a single layer 
of endocardium and a single layer of primitive beating cardiomyocytes.
The linear heart tube undergoes chamber specification and asym-
metric looping, coordinated with linear and concentric growth of dif-
ferent regions of the heart tube, to produce the presumptive atria and 
ventricles. Cells continue to migrate into the heart at both ends from 
later, or second, heart fields in adjacent pharyngeal mesoderm as loop-
ing and growth occur. These cells exhibit distinctive gene expression 
(e.g., Islet-1) and distinctive physiology (e.g., calcium handling), con-
tributing to discrete areas of the adult heart, including the right atrium 
and the right ventricle. Different embryonic origins of cells within the 
right and left ventricles help explain why some forms of congenital and 
adult heart diseases affect discrete regions of the heart.

and  folic  acid,  and  congenital  heart  dis-
ease  involving  abnormal  remodeling  of 
the  aortic  arch  arteries  is  observed  with 
maternal  deficiencies  of  these  vitamins. 
The  shared  embryonic  origins  of  dif-
ferent  cardiovascular  cell  types  lead  to 
syndromic  associations  between  various 
congenital  heart  diseases  and  a  range  of 
extracardiac abnormalities.

Coronary  artery  formation  requires 
the  addition  of  yet  another  cell  popula-
tion  to  the  embryonic  heart.  Epicardial 
cells  arise  in  the  proepicardial  organ,  a 
derivative  of  the  septum  transversum, 
which  also  contributes  to  the  fibrous 
portion of the diaphragm and to the liver. 
Proepicardial  cells  contribute  smooth 
muscle  to  the  coronary  arteries  and  are 
required  for  proper  coronary  pattern-
ing.  Other  cell  types  within  the  heart 
(e.g., fibroblasts) also can arise from the 
proepicardium.

The  cardiac  conduction  system, 
which  generates  and  propagates  elec-
trical  impulses,  differentiates  from  car-
diomyocyte  precursors.  The  conduction 
system  is  composed  of  slow-conducting  
(proximal)  components,  such  as  the 
sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) 
nodes, as well as fast-conducting (distal) 
components,  including  the  His  bundle, 
bundle  branches,  and  Purkinje  fibers. 
Precursors  within  the  sinus  venosus 
give  rise  to  the  SA  node,  whereas  those 
within the AV canal mature into hetero-
geneous  cell  types  that  compose  the  AV 
node.  So-called  decremental  conduction 
through the AV node delays the electrical 
impulses  between  atria  and  ventricles, 
whereas  the  distal  conduction  system 
rapidly  delivers  the  impulse  throughout 
the ventricles. Each compartment within 
the conduction system expresses distinct 
gap  junction  proteins  and  ion  channels 
that  characterize  the  discrete  cell  fates 
and electrical properties. Developmental 
defects in the conduction system can lead to clinical electrophysiologic 
disorders,  such  as  congenital  heart  block  or  pre-excitation  (Wolff- 
Parkinson-White syndrome) (Chap. 246).

 ■ ORIGIN OF VASCULAR CELLS
Smooth-muscle  cells  are  of  varied  origin.  Some  upper-body  arterial 
smooth-muscle cells derive from the neural crest, whereas lower-body 
arteries  develop  smooth-muscle  cells  from  neighboring  mesodermal 
structures.  Bone  marrow–derived  endothelial  progenitors  may  aid 
repair of damaged or aging arteries. With the latter, bone marrow clon-
ality, increasingly prevalent in aging, may impart significant clonality 
into endothelial cell populations. Vascular stem cells resident in vessel 
walls may give rise to some smooth-muscle cells in injured or athero-
matous arteries (Chaps. 96 and 484).

THE BLOOD VESSEL
 ■ VASCULAR ULTRASTRUCTURE
Blood  vessels  participate  in  physiologic  function  as  well  as  disease 
biology in virtually every organ system. The smallest blood vessels—
capillaries—consist of a monolayer of endothelial cells on a basement 
membrane,  adjacent  to  a  discontinuous  layer  of  smooth-muscle-like

After  looping  and  chamber  formation,  a  series  of  morphogenetic 
events  divide  the  left  and  right  sides  of  the  heart,  separate  the  atria 
from the ventricles, and fashion the aorta and pulmonary artery from 
the truncus arteriosus. Cardiac valves form between the atria and the 
ventricles  and  between  the  ventricles  and  the  outflow  vessels.  Early 
in  development,  myocardial  cells  secrete  an  extracellular  matrix  rich 
in  hyaluronic  acid,  or  “cardiac  jelly,”  which  accumulates  within  the 
endocardial  cushions,  precursors  of  the  cardiac  valves.  Signals  from 
overlying myocardial cells trigger migration, invasion, and phenotypic 
changes in underlying endocardial cells, which undergo an epithelial- 
mesenchymal transformation to invade and populate the endocardial 
cushion matrix with cells. Mesenchymal cells then proliferate and form 
the mature valve leaflets.

The  great  vessels  form  as  a  series  of  bilaterally  symmetric  aortic 
arch arteries that remodel asymmetrically to define the mature central 
vasculature.  Migrating  neural  crest  cells  from  the  dorsal  neural  tube 
orchestrate this process and are necessary for aortic arch remodeling 
and the septation of the truncus arteriosus. The smooth-muscle cells 
within the tunica media of the aortic arch, the ductus arteriosus, and 
the carotid arteries all derive from neural crest. By contrast, smooth- 
muscle within the descending aorta arises from lateral plate mesoderm, 
and  smooth-muscle  of  the  proximal  outflow  tract  arises  from  the 
second  heart  field.  Neural  crest  cells  are  sensitive  to  both  vitamin  A 

FIGURE 237-1  A. Schematic depiction of a transverse section through an early embryo depicts the bilateral regions 
where early heart tubes form. B. The bilateral heart tubes subsequently migrate to the midline and fuse to form the 
linear  heart  tube.  C.  At  the  early  cardiac  crescent  stage  of  embryonic  development,  cardiac  precursors  include 
a  primary  heart  field  fated  to  form  the  linear  heart  tube  and  a  second  heart  field  fated  to  add  myocardium  to  the 
inflow and outflow poles of the heart. D. Second heart field cells populate the pharyngeal region before subsequently 
migrating to the maturing heart. E. Large portions of the right ventricle and outflow tract and some cells within the atria 
derive from the second heart field. F. The aortic arch arteries form as symmetric sets of vessels that then remodel 
under the influence of the neural crest to form the asymmetric mature vasculature. LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; RA,

is laminar blood flow, and the measure-
ment  of  flow-mediated  dilatation  can 
assess  endothelial  vasodilator  function 
in  humans  (Fig.  237-3).  Endothelial 
cells  also  produce  potent  vasoconstric-
tor  substances  such  as  endothelin. 
Excessive  production  of  reactive  oxy-
gen  species,  such  as  superoxide  anion 
–), by endothelial or smooth-muscle 
(O2
cells  under  pathologic  conditions  (e.g., 
excessive  exposure  to  angiotensin  II) 
can  promote  local  oxidative  stress  and 
inactivate NO.

Endothelial  cells  also  regulate  leu-
kocyte  traffic  through  tissues.  Normal 
endothelium  exhibits  limited  interac-
tion  with  circulating  leukocytes,  but 
bacterial products such as endotoxin or 
proinflammatory  cytokines  can  induce 
endothelial  cells  to  express  an  array  of 
adhesion molecules that selectively bind 
various  classes  of  leukocytes  in  differ-
ent pathologic conditions. The adhesion 
molecules  and  chemokines  generated 
during acute bacterial infection tend to 
recruit  granulocytes,  while  in  chronic 
inflammatory  diseases  such  as  tuber-
culosis  or  atherosclerosis,  the  adhesion 
molecules  expressed  favor  monocyte 
recruitment.  Endothelial  cell  injury 
participates  in  the  pathophysiology  of 
many  immune-mediated  diseases.  For 
example, complement-mediated lysis of 
endothelial  cells  contributes  to  tissue 
injury. The foreign histocompatibility complex antigens on endothelial 
cells in solid-organ allografts can promote allograft arteriopathy, while 
immune-mediated  endothelial  injury  also  plays  a  role  in  thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

The  endothelium  also  regulates  the  balance  between  thrombosis 
and hemostasis through a highly tuned set of regulatory pathways. For 
example,  inflammatory  cytokines,  bacterial  endotoxin,  or  angioten-
sin  II  can  activate  endothelial  cells  to  produce  substantial  quantities 
of  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor  1  (PAI-1),  the  major  inhibitor  of 
fibrinolysis.  Inflammatory  stimuli  also  induce  endothelial  expression 
of the potent procoagulant tissue factor, a contributor to disseminated 
intravascular coagulation in sepsis. Thus, in pathologic circumstances, 
endothelial  dysfunction  tends  to  promote  local  thrombus  accumula-
tion rather than combat it.

Endothelial  cells  regulate  the  growth  of  subjacent  smooth- 
muscle  cells  by  elaborating  heparan  sulfate  glycosaminoglycans  that 
inhibit smooth-muscle proliferation. In the setting of vascular injury,  
endothelium-derived growth factors and chemoattractants (e.g., platelet- 
derived growth factor) induce the migration and proliferation of vas-
cular smooth-muscle cells. Dysregulation of these growth-stimulatory 
molecules  may  promote  smooth-muscle  accumulation  in  atheroscle-
rotic lesions.

cells  known  as  pericytes  (Fig.  237-2A).  Arteries  typically  have  a  tril-
aminar structure (Fig. 237-2B–E). The intima consists of a monolayer 
of endothelial cells continuous with those of the capillaries. The middle 
layer,  or  tunica  media,  consists  of  smooth-muscle  cells  and,  in  veins, 
consists  of  just  a  few  layers  of  smooth-muscle  cells  (Fig.  237-2B). 
The  outer  layer,  or  adventitia,  consists  of  extracellular  matrix  with 
fibroblasts,  mast  cells,  and  nerve  terminals.  Larger  arteries  require 
nourishment  of  the  tunica  media  that  is  accomplished  via  their  own 
vasculature, the vasa vasorum (Fig. 237-2E).

Arterioles  are  small  muscular  arteries  (Fig.  237-2C)  that  regulate 
blood pressure and flow through arterial beds. Medium-size muscular 
arteries  also  contain  prominent  smooth-muscle  layers  (Fig.  237-2D) 
that participate in atherosclerosis. Larger elastic arteries have a highly 
structured  tunica  media  with  concentric  bands  of  smooth-muscle 
cells,  interspersed  with  strata  of  elastin-rich  extracellular  matrix  
(Fig. 237-2E). Larger arteries form an internal elastic lamina between 
intima and media, while an external elastic lamina partitions the media 
from surrounding adventitia.

 ■ VASCULAR CELL BIOLOGY
Endothelial  Cell  The  endothelium  forms  the  interface  between 
tissues  and  the  blood  compartment,  regulating  the  passage  of  mol-
ecules  and  cells.  This  function  of  endothelial  cells  as  a  selectively 
permeable barrier fails in vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, 
hypertension, and renal disease, as well as in pulmonary edema, sepsis, 
and other situations exhibiting “capillary leak.”

The  endothelium  also  participates  in  the  local  regulation  of  vas-
cular  tone  and  blood  flow.  Endogenous  endothelium-derived  sub-
stances,  such  as  prostacyclin,  endothelium-derived  hyperpolarizing 
factor, nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), provide tonic 
stimulation  of  endothelial  homeostatic  properties  under  physiologic 
conditions in vivo (Table 237-1). Impaired production or excess cat-
abolism  of  these  substances  can  mediate  dysfunctional  properties  of 
the endothelium. A major homeostatic influence on the endothelium

migration  and  proliferation  underlie  the  vascular  disease  that  occurs 
in sustained high-flow states such as left-to-right shunts in congenital 
heart disease.

Smooth-muscle  cells  secrete  the  bulk  of  vascular  extracellular 
matrix.  Excessive  production  of  collagen  and  glycosaminoglycans 
contributes  to  the  remodeling,  altered  biomechanics,  and  physiology 
of arteries affected by hypertension or atherosclerosis. In larger elastic 
arteries,  such  as  the  aorta,  the  ability  to  store  the  kinetic  energy  of 
systole  promotes  tissue  perfusion  during  diastole.  Arterial  stiffness 
associated with aging or disease, evident in a widening pulse pressure, 
increases left ventricular afterload and portends a poor outcome.

Like  endothelial  cells,  vascular  smooth-muscle  cells  not  only 
respond to paracrine stimuli from other cells, but can themselves serve 
as  a  source  of  such  stimuli.  For  example,  proinflammatory  stimuli 
induce smooth-muscle cells to elaborate cytokines and other mediators 
that drive thrombosis and fibrinolysis as well as proliferation.

Vascular  Smooth-Muscle  Cell  Contraction  The  principal 
mechanism  for  vascular  smooth-muscle  cell  contraction  is  increased 
cytoplasmic calcium concentration due to transmembrane influx and 
triggered release from intracellular calcium stores (Fig. 237-4). In vas-
cular smooth-muscle cells, voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels 
open with membrane depolarization. Local influx of calcium, termed 
calcium  sparks,  can  trigger  release  from  intracellular  stores,  which 
results  in  more  contraction  and  increased  vessel  tone  (see  below). 
Opposing currents balance the effects of individual ionic fluxes, pro-
moting homeostasis, which is tightly regulated by neural and metabolic 
influences.

Vasoconstricting agonists also increase intracellular [Ca2+] by various 
mechanisms  including  receptor-dependent  phospholipase  C  activa-
tion  producing  hydrolysis  of  phosphatidylinositol  4,5-bisphosphate  to 
generate  diacylglycerol  (DAG)  and  inositol  1,4,5-trisphosphate  (IP3). 
These membrane lipid derivatives, in turn, activate protein kinase C and 
increase intracellular [Ca2+]. In addition, IP3 binds specific sarcoplasmic 
reticulum (SR) receptors to increase calcium efflux from this storage 
pool into the cytoplasm.

Vascular smooth-muscle cell contraction depends on myosin light 
chain  phosphorylation  that  reflects  the  balance  between  the  activity 
of relevant kinases and phosphatases. Calcium activates myosin light 
chain kinase via calmodulin, augmenting myosin ATPase activity and 
enhancing  contraction.  Conversely,  myosin  light  chain  phosphatase 
reduces  myosin  ATPase  activity  and  contractile  force.  Other  kinase/
phosphorylase  combinations  result  in  a  complex  regulatory  network 
that refines vascular tone and links it to physiologic requirements.

Control  of  Vascular  Smooth-Muscle  Cell  Tone  The  auto-
nomic nervous system and endothelial cells modulate vascular smooth- 
muscle cells through similar convergent pathways. Autonomic neurons 
enter vessel media and modulate vascular smooth-muscle cell tone in 
response to baroreceptors and chemoreceptors within the aortic arch 
or  carotid  bodies  and  to  thermoreceptors  in  the  skin.  Rapidly  acting 
reflex  arcs  modulated  by  central  inputs  respond  to  multiple  sensory 
inputs  as  well  as  emotional  stimuli  through  three  neuronal  classes: 
sympathetic,  whose  principal  neurotransmitters  are  epinephrine  and 
norepinephrine;  parasympathetic,  whose  principal  neurotransmitter 
is  acetylcholine;  and  nonadrenergic/noncholinergic,  which  include 
two  subgroups—nitrergic,  whose  principal  neurotransmitter  is  NO, 
and  peptidergic,  whose  principal  neurotransmitters  are  substance  P, 
vasoactive intestinal peptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and the 
nonpeptide, adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

Each of these neurotransmitters acts through specific receptors on 
the  vascular  smooth-muscle  cell  to  modulate  intracellular  Ca2+  and, 
consequently, contractile tone. Norepinephrine activates α adrenergic 
receptors, and epinephrine activates both α and β receptors. In most 
blood vessels, norepinephrine activates postjunctional α1 receptors in 
large arteries and α2 receptors in small arteries and arterioles, leading 
to  vasoconstriction.  Most  blood  vessels  express  β2-adrenergic  recep-
tors on their vascular smooth-muscle cells and respond to β agonists 
by  cyclic  AMP–dependent  relaxation.  Acetylcholine  released  from

Joseph A. Vita, MD.)

Vascular  Smooth-Muscle  Cell  Contraction  and  relaxation  of 
vascular  smooth-muscle  cells  in  muscular  arteries  determine  blood 
pressure,  regional  flow,  and  the  afterload  experienced  by  the  left 
ventricle  (see  below).  Venous  tone  regulates  venous  tree  capacitance 
and,  thus,  influences  ventricular  preload.  Smooth-muscle  cells  in 
the  adult  vessel  seldom  replicate  in  the  absence  of  arterial  injury  or 
inflammatory  activation,  but  proliferation  and  migration  of  arterial 
smooth-muscle cells contribute to arterial stenoses in atherosclerosis, 
arteriolar  remodeling  in  hypertension,  and  the  hyperplastic  response 
of  arteries  to  injury.  In  the  pulmonary  circulation,  smooth-muscle

parasympathetic neurons may bind to muscarinic receptors on either 
vascular smooth-muscle cells, causing vasoconstriction, or endothelial 
cells, causing NO-dependent vasorelaxation. Nitrergic neurons release 
NO, which relaxes vascular smooth-muscle cells via the cyclic GMP–
dependent and –independent mechanisms outlined, and other pepti-
dergic inputs that regulate vascular tone. For the detailed molecular 
physiology of the autonomic nervous system, see Chap. 440.

The release of endothelial effectors of vascular smooth-muscle cell 
tone  integrates  the  smooth-muscle  response  to  mechanical  (shear 
stress, cyclic strain, etc.) and biochemical stimuli (purinergic agonists, 
muscarinic  agonists,  peptidergic  agonists).  In  addition  to  these  local 
paracrine  modulators,  a  complex  system  of  circulating  modulators 
ranging  from  norepinephrine  to  the  natriuretic  peptides  also  modu-
lates vascular smooth-muscle cell tone.

 ■ ARTERIOGENESIS AND ANGIOGENESIS
Recruitment  and  growth  of  blood  vessels  (arteriogenesis)  and  new 
capillaries  (angiogenesis)  can  occur  in  response  to  conditions  such 
as chronic hypoxemia and tissue ischemia. Growth factors, including 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth fac-
tor (FGF), can activate a signaling cascade that stimulates endothelial 
proliferation  and  tube  formation,  defined  as  angiogenesis.  Guidance 
molecules,  including  members  of  the  semaphorin  family  of  secreted 
peptides,  direct  blood  vessel  patterning  by  attracting  or  repelling 
nascent  endothelial  tubes.  The  recruitment  and  expansion  of  preex-
isting collateral vascular networks in response to a blocked artery, an 
example of arteriogenesis, can result from selective activation of both 
growth factors and, perhaps, local or circulating endothelial progenitor 
cells. True vascular regeneration, or the development of a new blood 

vessel  that  includes  all  three  cell  layers,  normally  does  not  occur  in 
adult mammals, but recent scientific advances might help obviate such 
limitations (Chaps. 96 and 484).

CELLULAR BASIS OF CARDIAC 
CONTRACTION
 ■ CARDIAC ULTRASTRUCTURE
Most of the ventricular mass is composed of cardiomyocytes, normally 
60–140 μm in length and 17–25 μm in diameter (Fig. 237-5A). Each 
cell contains multiple myofibrils that run the length of the cell and are 
composed  of  series  of  repeating  sarcomeres.  The  cytoplasm  between 
the myofibrils contains other cell constituents, including a single cen-
trally located nucleus, mitochondria, and the intracellular membrane 
system, the SR.

The sarcomere, the structural and functional unit of contraction, lies 
between adjacent Z lines, which on transmission electron microscopy 
are seen as dark repeating bands. The distance between Z lines varies 
with  the  degree  of  contraction  or  stretch  of  the  muscle  and  ranges 
between 1.6 and 2.2 μm. At the center of the sarcomere is a dark band 
of constant length (1.5 μm), the A band, which is flanked by two lighter 
bands, the I bands, which are of variable length. The sarcomere of heart 
muscle, like that of skeletal muscle, consists of interdigitating thick and 
thin  myofilaments.  Thicker  filaments,  composed  principally  of  the 
protein myosin, traverse the A band; they are about 10 nm (100 Å) in 
diameter,  with  tapered  ends.  Thinner  filaments,  composed  primarily 
of actin, course from the Z lines through the I band into the A band; 
they are ~5 nm (50 Å) in diameter and 1.0 μm in length. Thus, thick

FIGURE 237-5  A shows the branching myocytes making up the cardiac myofibers. B illustrates the critical role played by the changing [Ca2+] in the myocardial cytosol.  
Ca2+ ions are schematically shown as entering through the calcium channel that opens in response to the wave of depolarization that travels along the sarcolemma. These 
Ca2+ ions “trigger” the release of more calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and thereby initiate a contraction-relaxation cycle. Eventually the small quantity of Ca2+ 
that has entered the cell leaves predominantly through an Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, with a lesser role for the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump. The varying actin-myosin overlap is shown 
for (B) systole, when [Ca2+] is maximal, and (C) diastole, when [Ca2+] is minimal. D. The myosin heads, attached to the thick filaments, interact with the thin actin filaments.

and thin filaments overlap only within the (dark) A band, whereas the 
(light)  I  band  contains  only  thin  filaments.  On  electron-microscopic 
examination,  bridges  extend  between  the  thick  and  thin  filaments 
within the A band; these are myosin heads (see below) bound to actin 
filaments.

 ■ THE CONTRACTILE PROCESS
The sliding filament model for muscle contraction rests on the central 
observation that both the thick and the thin filaments are constant in 
length  during  both  contraction  and  relaxation.  With  activation,  the 
actin filaments are propelled farther into the A band. In the process, 
the  A  band  remains  constant  in  length,  whereas  the  I  band  shortens 
and the Z lines move toward one another.

The  myosin  molecule  is  a  complex,  asymmetric  protein  with  a 
molecular mass of about 500,000 Da; it has a rod-like portion that is 
about 150 nm (1500 Å) in length with a globular portion (head) at its 
end.  The  globular  portions  of  myosin  form  the  bridges  to  actin  and 
are  the  site  of  ATPase  activity.  In  thick  myofilaments,  composed  of 

~300 longitudinally stacked myosin molecules, the rod-like segments 
of  myosin  assume  an  orderly,  polarized  orientation,  with  outwardly 
projecting globular heads interacting with actin to generate force and 
shorten (Fig. 237-5B).

Actin  has  a  molecular  mass  of  about  47,000  Da.  Thin  filaments 
consist of a double helix of two chains of actin molecules wound about 
each other on a larger molecule, tropomyosin. A group of regulatory 
proteins—troponins  C,  I,  and  T—localize  at  regular  intervals  on  this 
filament (Fig. 237-6). In contrast to myosin, actin lacks intrinsic enzy-
matic activity, but combines reversibly with myosin in the presence of 
ATP  and  Ca2+.  Calcium  activates  the  myosin  ATPase,  which  breaks 
down ATP to supply the energy for contraction (Fig. 237-6). The activ-
ity of myosin ATPase determines the rate of actomyosin cross-bridge 
formation  and  breakdown  and  ultimately  determines  contraction 
velocity. In relaxed muscle, tropomyosin inhibits this interaction. Titin 
(Fig.  237-5D)  an  enormous,  flexible,  myofibrillar  protein,  connects 
myosin to the Z line; its elasticity contributes to the passive mechanical 
characteristics  of  the  heart.  Dystrophin,  a  cytoskeletal  protein  that

FIGURE 237-6  Four steps in cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. In relaxed muscle (upper left), ATP bound to the myosin cross-bridge dissociates the thick and 
thin filaments. Step 1: Hydrolysis of myosin-bound ATP by the ATPase site on the myosin head transfers the chemical energy of the nucleotide to the activated cross-
bridge (upper right). When cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is low, as in relaxed muscle, the reaction cannot proceed because tropomyosin and the troponin complex on the 
thin filament do not allow the active sites on actin to interact with the cross-bridges. Therefore, even though the cross-bridges are energized, they cannot interact with 
actin. Step 2: When Ca2+ binding to troponin C has exposed active sites on the thin filament, actin interacts with the myosin cross-bridges to form an active complex (lower 
right) in which the energy derived from ATP is retained in the actin-bound cross-bridge, whose orientation has not yet shifted. Step 3: The muscle contracts when ADP 
dissociates from the cross-bridge. This step leads to the formation of the low-energy rigor complex (lower left) in which the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis 
has been expended to perform mechanical work (the “rowing” motion of the cross-bridge). Step 4: The muscle returns to its resting state, and the cycle ends when a new 
molecule of ATP binds to the rigor complex and dissociates the cross-bridge from the thin filament. This cycle continues until calcium is dissociated from troponin C in the 
thin filament, which causes the contractile proteins to return to the resting state with the cross-bridge in the energized state. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine

binds  to  the  dystroglycan  complex  at  membrane  adherens  junctions, 
tethers  the  sarcomere  to  the  cell  membrane  at  these  regions  of  tight 
coupling to adjacent myocytes. Mutations in multiple sarcomeric and 
cytoskeletal proteins cause different Mendelian disorders involving the 
heart and skeletal muscle and also sensitize individuals to toxic cardio-
myopathies (e.g., due to alcohol or chemotherapy).

During activation of the cardiac myocyte, Ca2+ binds the heterotri-
mer  troponin  C,  resulting  in  regulatory  conformational  changes 
in  tropomyosin  and  exposing  actin  cross-bridge  interaction  sites  
(Fig.  237-6).  Repetitive  interaction  between  myosin  heads  and  actin 
filaments is termed cross-bridge cycling and results in sliding of the actin 
along the myosin filaments, with muscle shortening and/or the devel-
opment  of  tension.  The  splitting  of  ATP  then  dissociates  the  myosin 
cross-bridge from actin. In the presence of ATP (Fig. 237-6), actin and 
myosin filaments bind and dissociate cyclically if sufficient Ca2+ is pres-
ent; these processes cease when [Ca2+] falls below a critical level, and 
the  troponin-tropomyosin  complex  once  more  inhibits  actin-myosin 
interactions (Fig. 237-7).

Cytoplasmic [Ca2+] is a principal determinant of the inotropic state 
of the heart. Most agents that stimulate myocardial contractility (posi-
tive inotropic stimuli), including digitalis glycosides and β-adrenergic 
agonists,  increase  cytoplasmic  [Ca2+],  triggering  cross-bridge  cycling. 
Increased  adrenergic  neuronal  activity  stimulates  myocardial  con-
tractility  through  norepinephrine  release,  activation  of  β  adrenergic 
receptors, and, via Gs-stimulated guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, 
activation of the adenylyl cyclase, which leads to the formation of the 
intracellular  second  messenger  cyclic  AMP  from  ATP  (Fig.  237-7). 
Cyclic  AMP  in  turn  activates  protein  kinase  A  (PKA),  which  phos-
phorylates sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels, thereby enhancing the influx of 
Ca2+ into the myocyte.

The  SR  (Fig.  237-8),  a  complex  network  of  anastomosing  intra-
cellular channels, invests the myofibrils. The transverse tubules, or T  
system,  closely  related  to  the  SR,  both  structurally  and  functionally, 
arise  as  sarcolemmal  invaginations  that  extend  into  the  myofibrillar 
bundles along the Z lines, i.e., the ends of the sarcomeres.

 ■ CARDIAC ACTIVATION
In  the  inactive  state,  the  cardiac  cell  is  electrically  polarized;  i.e.,  the 
interior  has  a  negative  charge  relative  to  the  outside  of  the  cell,  with 
a transmembrane potential of –80 to –100 mV (Chap. 243). The sar-
colemma, which in the resting state is largely impermeable to Na+, and 
a Na+- and K+-pump energized by ATP that extrudes Na+ from the cell 
and  maintain  the  resting  potential.  In  this  resting  state,  intracellular 
[K+] is relatively high and [Na+] is far lower; conversely, extracellular 
[Na+]  is  high  and  [K+]  is  low.  At  the  same  time,  extracellular  [Ca2+] 
greatly exceeds free intracellular [Ca2+].

The  action  potential  has  four  phases  (see  Fig.  243-1B).  During 
the action potential plateau (phase 2), there is a slow inward current 
through sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channels (Fig. 237-8). Depolarizing 
current spreads across the cell membrane, penetrating deeply into the 
cell via the T tubular system. The absolute quantity of Ca2+ traversing 
sarcolemmal and T tubular membranes is modest and insufficient to 
fully  activate  contraction.  However,  this  initial  Ca2+  current,  through 
Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, triggers substantial Ca2+ release from the SR, 
inducing contraction.

Ca2+ is released from the SR through a Ca2+ release channel, a cardiac 
isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR2). Several regulatory proteins, 
including calstabin 2, inhibit RyR2 and thus SR Ca2+ release. Inherited 
disorders  or  exogenous  factors  affecting  the  efficiency  or  stability  of 
SR Ca2+ handling can impair contraction, leading to heart failure or to 
ventricular arrhythmias.

The Ca2+ released from the SR diffuses to interact with myofibrillar 
troponin  C  (Fig.  237-7),  repressing  this  protein’s  inhibition  of  con-
traction,  and  so  activating  myofilaments  to  shorten.  During  repolar-
ization,  the  activity  of  the  SR  Ca2+  ATPase  (SERCA2A)  leads  to  Ca2+ 
uptake against a concentration gradient into the SR where it complexes 
with  another  specialized  protein,  calsequestrin.  The  uptake  of  Ca2+ 
is  ATP  (energy)-dependent  and  lowers  cytoplasmic  [Ca2+]  to  a  level 
where  actomyosin  interaction  is  inhibited  and  myocardial  relaxation 
occurs.  There  is  also  a  sarcolemmal  exchange  of  Ca2+  for  Na+  (Fig. 
237-8), reducing the cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. Additional control of calcium

FIGURE 237-7  Signal systems involved in positive inotropic and lusitropic (enhanced relaxation) effects of `-adrenergic stimulation. When the β-adrenergic agonist 
interacts  with  the  β  receptor,  a  series  of  G  protein–mediated  changes  leads  to  activation  of  adenylyl  cyclase  and  the  formation  of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate 
(cAMP). The latter acts via protein kinase A to stimulate metabolism (left) and phosphorylate the Ca2+ channel protein (right). The result is an enhanced opening probability 
of the Ca2+ channel, thereby increasing the inward movement of Ca2+ ions through the sarcolemma (SL) of the T tubule. These Ca2+ ions release more calcium from the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to increase cytosolic Ca2+ and activate troponin C. Ca2+ ions also increase the rate of breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Enhanced myosin ATPase activity explains the increased rate of contraction, with increased activation of troponin C 
explaining increased peak force development. An increased rate of relaxation results from the ability of cAMP to activate as well the protein phospholamban, situated on 
the membrane of the SR, that controls the rate of uptake of calcium into the SR. The latter effect explains enhanced relaxation (lusitropic effect). P, phosphorylation; PL, 
phospholamban; TnI, troponin I. (Courtesy of L.H. Opie.)

compartmentalization results from cyclic AMP–dependent PKA phos-
phorylation  of  the  SR  protein  phospholamban,  permitting  SERCA2A 
activation,  increasing  SR  Ca2+  uptake,  and  so  accelerating  relaxation 
rates and loading the SR with Ca2+ for subsequent cycles of release and 
contraction.

Thus, the combination of the cell membrane, transverse tubules, and 
SR, which transmit the action potential, release and then reaccumulate 
Ca2+,  controls  the  cyclic  contraction  and  relaxation  of  heart  muscle. 
Genetic  or  pharmacologic  alterations  of  any  component  can  disturb 
any of the functions of this finely tuned system.

 ■ THE ROLE OF MUSCLE LENGTH (PRELOAD)
Preload  determines  sarcomere  length  at  the  onset  of  contraction. 
Contractile  force  is  optimal  at  specific  sarcomere  lengths  (~2.2  μm) 
where both myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is maximal and myofilament 
interactions and activation of contraction are most efficient. The rela-
tionship between initial muscle fiber length and the developed force is 
the basis of Starling’s law of the heart, which states that, within limits, 
the ventricular contraction force depends on the end-diastolic length 
of the cardiac muscle, which in vivo relates closely to the ventricular 
end-diastolic volume.

CONTROL OF CARDIAC PERFORMANCE 
AND OUTPUT
The  extent  of  shortening  of  heart  muscle  and,  therefore,  ventricular 
stroke volume in the intact heart depends on three major influences: 
(1) the length of the muscle at the onset of contraction, i.e., the preload; 
(2) the tension that the muscle must develop during contraction, i.e., 
the afterload; and (3) muscle contractility, i.e., the extent and velocity 
of shortening at any given preload and afterload. Table 237-2 lists the 
major determinants of preload, afterload, and contractility.

 ■ CARDIAC PERFORMANCE
Ventricular end-diastolic or “filling” pressure can serve as a surrogate 
for end-diastolic volume. In isolated heart and heart-lung preparations, 
stroke volume varies directly with the end-diastolic fiber length (pre-
load) and inversely with the arterial resistance (afterload), and as the 
heart fails—i.e., as its contractility declines—it delivers a progressively 
smaller  stroke  volume  from  a  normal  or  even  elevated  end-diastolic 
volume.  The  relation  between  ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure  and 
the  stroke  work  of  the  ventricle  (the  ventricular  function  curve)

FIGURE 237-8  The Ca2+ fluxes and key structures involved in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The arrows denote the direction of Ca2+ fluxes. The thickness of 
each arrow indicates the magnitude of the calcium flux. Two Ca2+ cycles regulate excitation-contraction coupling and relaxation. The larger cycle is entirely intracellular 
and involves Ca2+ fluxes into and out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as well as Ca2+ binding to and release from troponin C. The smaller extracellular Ca2+ cycle occurs when 
this cation moves into and out of the cell. The action potential opens plasma membrane Ca2+ channels to allow passive entry of Ca2+ into the cell from the extracellular fluid 
(arrow A). Only a small portion of the Ca2+ that enters the cell directly activates the contractile proteins (arrow A1). The extracellular cycle is completed when Ca2+ is actively 
transported back out to the extracellular fluid by way of two plasma membrane fluxes mediated by the sodium-calcium exchanger (arrow B1) and the plasma membrane 
calcium pump (arrow B2). In the intracellular Ca2+ cycle, passive Ca2+ release occurs through channels in the cisternae (arrow C) and initiates contraction; active Ca2+ uptake 
by the Ca2+ pump of the sarcotubular network (arrow D) relaxes the heart. Diffusion of Ca2+ within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (arrow G) returns this activator cation to the 
cisternae, where it is stored in a complex with calsequestrin and other calcium-binding proteins. Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum initiates systole when it 
binds to troponin C (arrow E). Lowering of cytosolic [Ca2+] by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) causes this ion to dissociate from troponin (arrow F) and relaxes the heart. 
Ca2+ also may move between mitochondria and cytoplasm (H). (Reproduced with permission from AM Katz: Physiology of the Heart, 4th ed. Philadelphia, Lippincott, Williams 
& Wilkins, 2005.)

provides  a  working  definition  of  cardiac  contractility  in  the  intact 
organism. An increase in contractility is accompanied by a shift of the 
ventricular function curve upward and to the left (greater stroke work 
at any level of ventricular end-diastolic pressure, or lower end-diastolic 
volume at any level of stroke work), whereas a shift downward and to 
the right characterizes reduction of contractility (Fig. 237-9).

 ■ VENTRICULAR AFTERLOAD
In  the  intact  heart,  as  ex  vivo,  the  extent  and  velocity  of  shortening 
of ventricular muscle fibers at any level of preload and of myocardial 
contractility relate inversely to the afterload, i.e., the instantaneous load 
opposing shortening. In the intact heart, the afterload may be defined 
as the tension developed in the ventricular wall during ejection. After-
load is determined by the aortic impedance as well as by the volume of 
the  ventricular  cavity  and  myocardial  tissue  characteristics  including 
thickness. Laplace’s law models the tension of the myocardial fiber as 
the product of intracavitary ventricular pressure and ventricular radius 
divided by wall thickness. Therefore, at any given aortic pressure, the 
afterload on a dilated left ventricle exceeds that on a normal-sized ven-
tricle. Conversely, at the same aortic pressure and ventricular diastolic 
volume, the afterload on a hypertrophied ventricle is lower than that on 
a normal chamber. Aortic pressure (and impedance) in turn depends 
on the peripheral vascular resistance, the biomechanics of the arterial 
tree, and the volume of blood it contains at the onset of ejection.

Ventricular  afterload  finely  regulates  cardiovascular  performance 
(Fig.  237-10).  As  noted,  elevations  in  both  preload  and  contractility 
increase  myocardial  fiber  shortening,  whereas  increases  in  afterload 
reduce it. The extent of myocardial fiber shortening and left ventricular 
size determine stroke volume. An increase in arterial pressure induced 
by vasoconstriction, for example, augments afterload, which opposes 
myocardial fiber shortening, reducing stroke volume.

When myocardial contractility is impaired and the ventricle dilates, 
afterload  rises  (Laplace’s  law)  and  limits  cardiac  output.  Increased 
afterload also may result from neural and humoral stimuli that occur 
in  response  to  a  fall  in  cardiac  output.  This  increased  afterload  may 
reduce  cardiac  output  further,  thereby  increasing  ventricular  volume 
and initiating a vicious circle, especially in patients with ischemic heart 
disease  and  limited  myocardial  O2  supply.  Treatment  with  vasodila-
tors has the opposite effect; when afterload falls, cardiac output rises  
(Chap. 257).

Under normal circumstances, the various influences acting on car-
diac  performance  interact  in  a  complex  fashion  to  maintain  cardiac 
output  at  a  level  responsive  to  the  requirements  of  tissue  metabolic 
demands  (Fig.  237-10).  Interference  with  a  single  mechanism  may 
not influence the cardiac output due to homeostatic adjustments. For 
example,  a  moderate  reduction  of  blood  volume  or  the  loss  of  the 
atrial contribution to ventricular contraction can be tolerated without 
a  reduction  in  resting  cardiac  output.  Under  these  circumstances,

FIGURE  237-10  Interactions  in  the  intact  circulation  of  preload,  contractility, 
and  afterload  in  producing  stroke  volume.  Stroke  volume  combined  with  heart 
rate  determines  cardiac  output,  which,  when  combined  with  peripheral  vascular 
resistance,  determines  arterial  pressure  for  tissue  perfusion.  The  characteristics 
of  the  arterial  system  also  contribute  to  afterload,  an  increase  that  reduces 
stroke volume. The interaction of these components with carotid and aortic arch 
baroreceptors provides a feedback mechanism to higher medullary and vasomotor 
cardiac  centers  and  to  higher  levels  in  the  central  nervous  system  to  affect  a 
modulating influence on heart rate, peripheral vascular resistance, venous return, 
and  contractility.  (Reproduced  with  permission  from  MR  Starling,  in  WS  Colucci

other factors, such as adrenergic neuronal impulses increasing cardiac 
contractility, heart rate, and venous tone, will serve as compensatory 
mechanisms and sustain cardiac output in a normal individual. Ulti-
mately, understanding the complex interactions between these differ-
ent  variables  requires  rigorous  models  to  predict  relevant  outcomes, 
and  led  to  the  early  application  of  systems  engineering  principles  in 
medicine.

 ■ EXERCISE
The integrated response to exercise illustrates typical interactions among 
the three determinants of stroke volume: preload, afterload, and contrac-
tility (Fig. 237-9). Hyperventilation, the pumping action of the exercis-
ing muscles, and venoconstriction during exercise all augment venous 
return and hence ventricular filling and preload (Table 237-2). Simulta-
neously, the increase in neuronal and humoral adrenergic stimulation 
of  the  myocardium  and  the  tachycardia  that  occur  during  exercise 
combine  to  augment  the  myocardial  contractility  (Fig.  237-9,  curves 
1 and 2), together elevating stroke volume and stroke work, with little 
or no change in end-diastolic pressure and volume (Fig. 237-9, points 
A and B). Vasodilation occurs in the exercising muscles, thus limiting 
the increase in afterload that otherwise would occur as cardiac output 
rises  to  levels  as  high  as  five  times  greater  than  basal  levels  during 
maximal exercise. This vasodilation ultimately allows the achievement 
of  elevated  cardiac  outputs  during  exercise  at  arterial  pressures  only 
moderately higher than the resting state.

FIGURE  237-9  The  interrelations  among  influences  on  ventricular  end-diastolic 
volume (EDV) through stretching of the myocardium and the contractile state of the 
myocardium. Levels of ventricular EDV associated with filling pressures that result 
in dyspnea and pulmonary edema are shown on the abscissa. Levels of ventricular 
performance required when the subject is at rest, while walking, and during maximal 
activity are designated on the ordinate. The broken lines are the descending limbs of 
the ventricular-performance curves, which are rarely seen during life but show the 
level of ventricular performance if end-diastolic volume could be elevated to very 
high levels. For further explanation, see text. (Reproduced with permission from WS

ASSESSMENT OF CARDIAC FUNCTION
Several  techniques  can  define  impaired  cardiac  function  in  clinical 
practice. Cardiac output and stroke volume may decline in the presence 
of heart failure, but these variables are often within normal limits, espe-
cially at rest. A more sensitive index of cardiac function is the ejection 
fraction, i.e., the ratio of stroke volume to end-diastolic volume (normal 
value = 67 ± 8%), which is frequently depressed in systolic heart failure 
even when stroke volume is normal. Alternatively, abnormally elevated 
ventricular end-diastolic volume (normal value = 75 ± 20 mL/m2)  or

FIGURE 237-11  The responses of the left ventricle (LV) to increased afterload, increased preload, and increased and reduced contractility are shown in the pressure-
volume plane. Left. Effects of increases in preload and afterload on the pressure-volume loop. Because there has been no change in contractility, the end-systolic pressure-
volume relationship (ESPVR) is unchanged. With an increase in afterload, stroke volume falls (1 → 2); with an increase in preload, stroke volume rises (1 → 3). Right. With 
increased myocardial contractility and constant left ventricular end-diastolic volume, the ESPVR moves to the left of the normal line (lower end-systolic volume at any 
end-systolic pressure) and stroke volume rises (1 → 3). With reduced myocardial contractility, the ESPVR moves to the right; end-systolic volume is increased, and stroke 
volume falls (1 → 2).

end-systolic volume (normal value = 25 ± 7 mL/m2) signifies left ven-
tricular systolic impairment.

Noninvasive  techniques,  particularly  echocardiography,  radionu-
clide  scintigraphy,  and  cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) 
(Chap. 241), have great value in the clinical assessment of myocardial 
function.  They  provide  measurements  of  end-diastolic  and  end- 
systolic  volumes,  ejection  fraction,  and  systolic  shortening  rate,  and 
they  allow  assessment  of  ventricular  filling  (see  below)  as  well  as 
regional contraction, relaxation, and tissue characterization. The latter 
measurements have particular importance in ischemic heart disease, as 
myocardial infarction causes regional myocardial damage.

Strong dependence on ventricular loading conditions influences the 
precision  of  measurements  of  cardiac  output,  ejection  fraction,  and 
ventricular volumes as indices of cardiac function. Thus, a depressed 
ejection  fraction  and  lowered  cardiac  output  may  occur  in  patients 
with  normal  ventricular  function  but  reduced  preload,  as  occurs  in 
hypovolemia, or with increased afterload, as occurs in acutely elevated 
arterial pressure.

The  end-systolic  left  ventricular  pressure-volume  relationship  has 
particular  value  as  an  index  of  ventricular  performance  as  it  does 
not  depend  on  preload  and  afterload  (Fig.  237-11).  At  any  level  of 
myocardial  contractility,  left  ventricular  end-systolic  volume  varies 
inversely  with  end-systolic  pressure;  as  contractility  declines,  end-
systolic  volume  (at  any  level  of  end-systolic  pressure)  rises.  Invasive 
measurement  of  end-systolic  left  ventricular  pressure-volume  loops 
add rigor to research studies of left ventricular function, and integrated 
cardiopulmonary  exercise  testing  is  now  more  broadly  available,  but 
these techniques are less pragmatic than the more readily assessed indi-
ces  obtained  in  routine  clinical  practice,  such  as  ventricular  volumes 
and ejection fraction. Longitudinal measurements of some aspects of 
cardiovascular physiology are increasingly feasible with implantable or 
wearable devices.
 ■ DIASTOLIC FUNCTION
Ventricular filling is influenced by several characteristics of the myo-
cardium, including (1) the extent and speed of myocardial relaxation 
and  (2)  the  passive  stiffness  of  the  ventricular  wall.  The  former  is 
largely a function of the rate of uptake of Ca2+ by the SR that may be 
enhanced  by  adrenergic  activation  and  reduced  by  ischemia  due  to 
limited  ATP  available  for  pumping  Ca2+  into  the  SR  (see  above).  For 
the  latter,  ventricular  stiffness  increases  with  hypertrophy,  fibrosis, 
and  conditions  that  infiltrate  the  ventricle,  such  as  amyloid,  or  can 
result  from  an  extrinsic  constraint  (e.g.,  pericardial  compression)  
(Fig. 237-12).

Ventricular filling can be assessed by measuring flow velocity across 
the mitral valve using Doppler ultrasound. Normally, inflow velocity is 
more rapid in early diastole than during atrial systole. However, with 
mild to moderately impaired relaxation, the rate of early diastolic filling 
declines as presystolic filling rates rise. With further stiffening, flow is 
“pseudo-normalized,” as early ventricular filling becomes more rapid 
with rising left atrial pressure upstream of the left ventricle.
 ■ CARDIAC METABOLISM
The  heart  requires  a  continuous  supply  of  energy  (ATP)  not  only  to 
drive mechanical contraction but also to maintain ionic and biochemi-
cal homeostasis. The development of tension, the frequency of contrac-
tion, and myocardial contractility levels are the principal determinants

of the heart’s energy and oxygen requirements, representing ~15% of 
that of the entire organism.

The heart’s ATP production requires the generation of acetyl coen-
zyme A (acetyl-CoA) that can be derived from (in descending order) 
free fatty acids (FFAs), glucose, lactate, amino acids, and ketone bodies. 
Myocardial FFAs derive from circulating FFAs, whereas the cardiomyo-
cyte’s glucose derives from plasma as well as from myocardial glycogen 
stores (glycogenolysis). These two principal sources of acetyl-CoA are 
metabolized  distinctly  in  cardiac  muscle.  Glucose  is  converted  in  the 
cytoplasm  into  pyruvate,  which  passes  into  mitochondria  for  conver-
sion into acetyl-CoA that then undergoes oxidation. FFAs are converted 
to  acyl-CoA  in  the  cytoplasm  and  acetyl-CoA  in  the  mitochondria. 
Acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid (Krebs) cycle to produce ATP by oxi-
dative phosphorylation; ATP then enters the cytoplasm from the mito-
chondrial  compartment.  Intracellular  adenosine  diphosphate  (ADP), 
resulting from ATP breakdown, enhances ATP production.

In  the  fasted,  resting  state,  circulating  FFAs  furnish  most  of  the 
heart’s  acetyl-CoA  (~70%).  In  the  fed  state,  with  elevations  of  blood 
glucose  and  insulin,  glucose  oxidation  increases  and  FFA  oxidation 
subsides. Increased cardiac work, inotropic agents, hypoxia, and mild 
ischemia  all  enhance  myocardial  glucose  uptake,  production  (gly-
cogenolysis), and metabolism to pyruvate (glycolysis). Exercise raises 
circulating  lactate  levels  and  myocardial  utilization  of  acetyl-CoA. 
By  contrast,  β-adrenergic  stimulation,  even  from  stress,  raises  the 
circulating levels and metabolism of FFAs in favor of glucose. Severe 
myocardial  ischemia  inhibits  cytoplasmic  pyruvate  dehydrogenase, 
producing  incomplete  glucose  metabolism  to  lactic  acid  (anaerobic 
glycolysis).  Anaerobic  glycolysis  produces  much  less  ATP  than  does 
aerobic glucose metabolism. High concentrations of circulating FFAs, 
which  can  occur  when  adrenergic  stimulation  is  superimposed  on 
severe  ischemia,  reduce  oxidative  phosphorylation,  and  the  myocar-
dial content of ATP declines, impairing contraction. In addition, FFA 
breakdown  products  may  exert  toxic  or  arrhythmogenic  effects  on 
cardiac cell membranes.

Myocardial  energy  is  stored  as  creatine  phosphate  (CP),  which 
is  in  equilibrium  with  ATP,  the  immediate  energy  source.  In  states 
of  reduced  energy  availability,  the  CP  stores  decline  first.  Cardiac 
hypertrophy, fibrosis, tachycardia, increased wall tension due to ven-
tricular dilation, and increased intracytoplasmic [Ca2+] all contribute 
to  increased  myocardial  energy  needs.  When  coupled  with  reduced 
coronary flow reserve, as occurs with obstruction of coronary arteries 
or  abnormalities  of  the  coronary  microcirculation,  an  imbalance  in 
myocardial  ATP  production  relative  to  demand  may  occur,  and  the 
resulting ischemia can worsen or cause heart failure.

 ■ REGENERATING CARDIAC TISSUE
Adult  mammalian  myocardial  cells  are  fully  differentiated  and  have 
little or no regenerative potential; however, there is evidence that the 
immature  mammalian  heart  has  some  limited  regenerative  potential 
that rapidly becomes constrained with increasing maturity and work-
load.  Considerable  current  effort  is  being  devoted  to  evaluating  the 
utility of various approaches to facilitate the transient release of these 
constraints to enhance cardiac repair after injury. The success of such 
approaches  would  offer  the  exciting  possibility  of  reconstructing  an 
infarcted or failing ventricle (Chap. 484).

238 Epidemiology of 

Cardiovascular Disease
Thomas A. Gaziano, J. Michael Gaziano

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is now the most common cause of death 
worldwide. Before 1900, infectious diseases and malnutrition were the 
most common causes, and CVD was responsible for <10% of all deaths. 
In 2017, CVD accounted for 17.8 million deaths worldwide (32%), with 
the same rate now occurring in both high-income countries and low- 
and middle-income countries.

THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION
The global rise in CVD is the result of an unprecedented transforma-
tion  in  the  causes  of  morbidity  and  mortality  during  the  twentieth 
century.  Known  as  the  epidemiologic  transition,  this  shift  is  driven 
by industrialization, urbanization, and associated lifestyle and demo-
graphic changes and is taking place in every part of the world among 
all races, ethnic groups, and cultures. The transition is divided into four 
basic stages: pestilence and famine, receding pandemics, degenerative 
and  man-made  diseases,  and  delayed  degenerative  diseases.  A  fifth 
stage, characterized by an epidemic of inactivity and obesity, is emerg-
ing in some countries (Table 238-1).

The age of pestilence and famine is marked by malnutrition, infec-
tious  diseases,  and  high  infant  and  child  mortality  that  are  offset  by 
high fertility. Tuberculosis, dysentery, cholera, and influenza are often 
fatal, resulting in a mean life expectancy of about 30 years. CVD, which 
accounts for <10% of deaths, takes the form of rheumatic heart disease 
and  cardiomyopathies  due  to  infection  and  malnutrition.  Approxi-
mately 10% of the world’s population remains in the age of pestilence 
and famine.

Per  capita  income  and  life  expectancy  increase  during  the  age  of 
receding pandemics as the emergence of public health systems, cleaner 
water supplies, and improved nutrition combine to drive down deaths 
from infectious disease and malnutrition. Infant and childhood mor-
tality also decline, but deaths due to CVD increase to between 10% and 
35% of all deaths. Rheumatic valvular disease, hypertension, coronary 
heart disease (CHD), and stroke are the predominant forms of CVD. 
Almost 40% of the world’s population is currently in this stage.

The  age  of  degenerative  and  man-made  diseases  is  distinguished 
by  mortality  from  noncommunicable  diseases—primarily  CVD— 
surpassing  mortality  from  malnutrition  and  infectious  diseases. 
Caloric intake, particularly from animal fat, increases. CHD and stroke 
are  prevalent,  and  between  35%  and  65%  of  all  deaths  can  be  traced 
to CVD. Typically, the rate of CHD deaths exceeds that of stroke by a 
ratio of 2:1 to 3:1. During this period, average life expectancy surpasses 
the  age  of  50.  Roughly  35%  of  the  world’s  population  falls  into  this 
category.

DESCRIPTION
Predominance of malnutrition and infectious diseases as causes of death; 
high rates of infant and child mortality; low mean life expectancy
Improvements in nutrition and public health lead to decrease in rates of 
deaths related to malnutrition and infection; precipitous decline in infant 
and child mortality rates
Increased fat and caloric intake and decrease in physical activity lead 
to emergence of hypertension and atherosclerosis; with increase in life 
expectancy, mortality from chronic, noncommunicable diseases exceeds 
mortality from malnutrition and infectious disease
CVD and cancer are the major causes of morbidity and mortality; better 
treatment and prevention efforts help avoid deaths among those with 
disease and delay primary events; age-adjusted CVD morality declines; 
CVD affecting older and older individuals
Overweight and obesity increase at alarming rate; diabetes and 
hypertension increase; decline in smoking rates levels off; a minority of 
the population meets physical activity recommendations

In the age of delayed degenerative diseases, CVD and cancer remain 
the  major  causes  of  morbidity  and  mortality,  with  CVD  accounting 
for 40% of all deaths. However, age-adjusted CVD mortality declines, 
aided  by  preventive  strategies  (for  example,  smoking  cessation  pro-
grams  and  effective  blood  pressure  control),  acute  hospital  manage-
ment,  and  technologic  advances,  such  as  the  availability  of  bypass 
surgery.  CHD,  stroke,  and  congestive  heart  failure  are  the  primary 
forms of CVD. About 15% of the world’s population is now in the age 
of delayed degenerative diseases or is exiting this age and moving into 
the fifth stage of the epidemiologic transition.

In  the  industrialized  world,  physical  activity  continues  to  decline 
while  total  caloric  intake  increases.  The  resulting  epidemic  of  over-
weight  and  obesity  may  signal  the  start  of  the  age  of  inactivity  and 
obesity. Rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and lipid abnor-
malities are on the rise, trends that are particularly evident in children. 
If these risk factor trends continue, age-adjusted CVD mortality rates 
that have fallen for decades during the fourth phase could increase in 
the coming years as suggested by recent data.

 ■ PATTERNS IN THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION
Unique  regional  features  have  modified  aspects  of  the  transition 
in  various  parts  of  the  world.  High-income  countries  experienced 
declines  in  CVD  death  rates  by  as  much  as  50–60%  over  the  past  
60  years,  whereas  CVD  death  rates  increased  by  15%  over  the  past 
20 years in the low- and middle-income range and the rate of change 
has  been  faster.  However,  given  the  large  amount  of  available  data, 
the  United  States  serves  as  a  useful  reference  point  for  comparisons. 
The age of pestilence and famine occurred before 1900, with a largely 
agrarian  economy  and  population.  Infectious  diseases  accounted  for 
more  deaths  than  any  other  cause.  By  the  1930s,  the  country  pro-
ceeded through the age of receding pandemics. The establishment of 
public health infrastructures resulted in dramatic declines in infectious 
disease  mortality  rates.  Lifestyle  changes  due  to  rapid  urbanization 
resulted in a simultaneous increase in CVD mortality rates, reaching 
~390 per 100,000. Between 1930 and 1965, the country entered the age 
of  degenerative  and  man-made  diseases.  Infectious  disease  mortality 
rates fell to fewer than 50 per 100,000 per year, whereas CVD mortality 
rates  reached  peak  levels  with  increasing  urbanization  and  lifestyle 
changes in diet, physical activity, and tobacco consumption. The age of 
delayed degenerative diseases took place between 1965 and 2000. New 
therapeutic  approaches,  preventive  measures,  and  exposure  to  public 
health campaigns promoting lifestyle modifications led to substantial 
declines  in  age-adjusted  mortality  rates  and  a  steadily  rising  age  at 
which a first CVD event occurs.

Currently,  the  United  States  is  entering  what  appears  to  be  a  fifth 
phase. The decline in the age-adjusted CVD death rate of 3% per year 
through the 1970s and 1980s has tapered off in the 1990s to 2%. How-
ever, CVD death rates have declined by 3–5% per year during the first 
decade of the new millennium. Competing trends appear to be at play. 
On the one hand, an increase in the prevalence of diabetes and obesity, 
a slowing in the rate of decline in smoking, and a leveling off in the rate 
of detection and treatment for hypertension are in the negative column. 
On the other hand, cholesterol levels continue to decline in the face of 
increased statin use.

Many  high-income  countries  (HICs)—which  together  account  for 
15% of the population—have proceeded through four stages of the epi-
demiologic transition in roughly the same pattern as the United States. 
CHD is the dominant form of CVD in these countries, with rates that 
tend to be two- to fivefold higher than stroke rates. However, variations 
exist.  Whereas  North  America,  Australia,  and  central  northwestern 
European HICs experienced significant increases then rapid declines 
in CVD rates, southern and central European countries experienced a 
more gradual rise and fall in rates. More specifically, central European 
countries  (i.e.,  Austria,  Belgium,  and  Germany)  declined  at  slower 
rates compared to their northern counterparts (i.e., Finland, Sweden, 
Denmark, and Norway). Countries such as Portugal, Spain, and Japan 
never reached the high mortality rates that the United States and other 
countries did, with CHD mortality rates at 200 per 100,000, or less. The 
countries of Western Europe also exhibit a clear north/south gradient 
in absolute rates of CVD, with rates highest in northern countries (i.e., 
Finland, Ireland, and Scotland) and lowest in Mediterranean countries 
(i.e., France, Spain, and Italy). Japan is unique among the HICs, most 
likely  due  to  the  unique  dietary  patterns  of  its  population.  Although 
stroke rates increased dramatically, CHD rates did not rise as sharply 
in Japan. However, Japanese dietary habits are undergoing substantial 
changes, reflected in an increase in cholesterol levels.

Patterns  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries  (LMICs;  gross 
national  income  per  capita  $11,666)  depend,  in  part,  on  cultural 
differences,  secular  trends,  and  responses  at  the  country  level,  with 
regard  to  both  public  health  and  treatment  infrastructure.  Although 
communicable  diseases  continue  to  be  a  major  cause  of  death,  CVD 
has emerged as a significant health concern in LMICs. With 85% of the 
world’s population, LMICs are driving the rates of change in the global 
burden of CVD (Fig. 238-1). In most LMICs, an urban/rural gradient 
has emerged for CHD, stroke, and hypertension, with higher rates in 
urban centers.

However,  although  CVD  rates  are  rapidly  rising  globally,  vast  dif-
ferences  exist  among  the  regions  and  countries,  and  even  within  the

Disease  Study  2017.  Global  Burden  of  Disease  Study  2017  [GBD  2017]  Results.

countries  themselves  (Fig.  238-2).  The  East  Asia  and  Pacific  regions 
appear to be straddling the second and third phases of the epidemio-
logic transition. CVD is a major cause of death in China, but like Japan, 
stroke causes more deaths than CHD in a ratio of about three to one. 
Vietnam and Cambodia, on the other hand, are just emerging from the 
pestilence  and  famine  transition.  The  Middle  East  and  North  Africa 
regions also appear to be entering the third phase of the epidemiologic 
transition,  with  increasing  life  expectancy  and  CVD  death  rates  just 
below those of HICs. In general, Latin America appears to be in the 
third phase of the transition, although there is vast regional heteroge-
neity with some areas in the second phase of the transition and some 
in the fourth. The Eastern Europe and Central Asia regions, however, 
are firmly in the peak of the third phase, with the highest death rates 

due to CVD (~66%) in the world. Importantly, deaths due to CHD are 
not limited to the elderly in this region and have a significant effect on 
working-age  populations.  South  Asia—and  more  specifically,  India, 
which accounts for the greatest proportion of the region’s population—
is  experiencing  an  alarming  increase  in  heart  disease.  The  transition 
appears to be in the Western style, with CHD as the dominant form 
of  CVD.  However,  rheumatic  heart  disease  continues  to  be  a  major 
cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality.  As  in  South  Asia,  rheumatic  heart 
disease  is  also  an  important  cause  of  CVD  morbidity  and  mortality 
in sub-Saharan Africa, which largely remains in the first phase of the 
epidemiologic transition.

Many factors contribute to this heterogeneity among LMICs. First, 
the  regions  are  in  various  stages  of  the  epidemiologic  transition. 
Second,  vast  differences  in  lifestyle  and  behavioral  risk  factors  exist. 
Third,  racial  and  ethnic  differences  may  lead  to  altered  susceptibili-
ties to various forms of CVD. In addition, it should be noted that for 
most countries in these regions, accurate country-wide data on cause- 
specific mortality are not complete.
 ■ GLOBAL TRENDS IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
Over  the  past  5  years,  there  have  been  changes  in  the  trends  of  CVD 
that are reflective of both trends in demographics and management of 
disease, but also of the way deaths and diseases have been measured and 
estimated. In 2017, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study updated 
its  estimates  with  several  important  changes  based  on  newly  available 
data,  refinement  in  the  causes  of  death,  and  the  introduction  of  new 
modeling  techniques.  The  major  changes  include  the  addition  of  an 
independent estimation of population and fertility, the addition of over 
127 country-years of vital registration and verbal autopsy data, revisions 
of  some  deaths  from  “misclassified”  to  dementia,  Parkinson’s  disease 
and  atrial  fibrillation,  and  the  addition  of  new  diseases  such  as  non-
rheumatic  calcific  aortic  and  degenerative  mitral  valve  disease.  CVD 
accounts for 32% of deaths worldwide, a number expected to increase. 
In 2017, CHD accounted for 16.0% of all deaths globally and the largest

portion (10%) of global years of life lost (YLLs) and disability-adjusted 
life-years  (DALYs)  (7%).  Stroke  moved  from  the  third  to  the  second 
largest cause of death (11.0% of all deaths) and remained the third larg-
est contributor to global YLLs (7%) and DALYs (5%). Together, CHD 
and stroke accounted for more than a quarter of all deaths worldwide. 
The burden of stroke is of growing concern among LMICs. The impact 
of stroke on DALYs and mortality rates is more than three times greater 
in LMICs as compared to HICs.

With  85%  of  the  world’s  population,  LMICs  largely  drive  global 
CVD  rates  and  trends.  More  than  14  million  (14.4)  CVD  deaths 
occurred in LMICs in 2017, compared to 3.3 million in HICs. Glob-
ally,  there  is  evidence  of  significant  delays  in  age  of  occurrence  and/
or  improvements  in  case  fatality  rates;  between  1990  and  2017,  the 
number of CVD deaths increased by 49%, but age-adjusted death rates 
decreased by 30.4% in the same period. Age-standardized death rates, 
however,  have  declined  faster  in  HICs  than  in  middle-income  and 
lower-income regions (Fig. 238-3). Population growth has been greater 
in LMICs compared to HICs. As a result of slower rates of population 
growth in HICs, overall CVD deaths remained steady. However, in the 
LMICs,  the  population  aging  and  growth  outstripped  gains  in  age- 
adjusted mortality reductions such that overall CVD deaths continued 
to climb over the past 25 years (Fig. 238-4).

Although  HIC  population  growth  will  be  fueled  by  immigration 
from LMICs, the populations of HICs will shrink as a proportion of the 
world’s population. The modest decline in CVD death rates that began 
in the HICs in the latter third of the twentieth century will continue, 
but the rate of decline appears to be slowing. However, these countries 
are expected to see an increase in the prevalence of CVD, as well as the 
absolute number of deaths as the population ages.

Significant portions of the population living in LMICs have entered 
the third phase of the epidemiologic transition, and some are entering 
the  fourth  stage.  Changing  demographics  play  a  significant  role  in 
future  predictions  for  CVD  throughout  the  world.  For  example,  the 
population growth rate in Eastern Europe and Central Asia was 1.1% 
between 2010 and 2017, whereas it was 11% in South Asia. CVD rates 
will also have an economic impact. Even assuming no increase in CVD 
risk  factors,  most  countries,  but  especially  India  and  South  Africa, 
will see a large number of people between 35 and 64 die of CVD over 
the  next  30  years,  as  well  as  an  increasing  level  of  morbidity  among  
middle-aged people related to heart disease and stroke.

 ■ RISK FACTORS
Global  variation  in  CVD  rates  is  related  to  temporal  and  regional 
variations  in  known  risk  factors  and  behaviors.  Ecologic  analyses  of 
major  CVD  risk  factors  and  mortality  demonstrate  high  correlations 
between expected and observed mortality rates for the three main risk 
factors—smoking, serum cholesterol, and hypertension—and suggest 
that many regional variations are based on differences in conventional 
risk factors.

Behavioral  Risk  Factors 
•  TOBACCO  Over  1.4  billion  people 
use tobacco worldwide. Tobacco use currently causes about 7.1 million 
deaths  annually  (12.7%  of  all  deaths),  2.6  million  of  which  are  CVD- 
related.  The  population  of  the  high-income  country  group  smokes 
(21.6%) at almost double the rate of the low-income countries (11.2%), 
whereas  the  middle-income  country  group’s  smoking  rate  (19.5%) 
approximates the global average (19.2%). From 2007 to 2017, smoking 
rates decreased across low-, middle-, and high-income country groups, 
with  relative  reductions  of  19%,  12%,  and  20%,  respectively.  By  2030, 
the  global  average  smoking  rate  is  expected  to  decline  from  19%  to 
16%  (women,  4%;  men,  28%);  however,  the  number  of  tobacco  users 
is expected to rise owing to population growth. Secondhand smoke is 
another well-established cause of CVD, responsible for 575,000 deaths of 
nonsmokers in 2017. Although smoking bans have both immediate and 
long-term benefits, implementation varies greatly between countries.

DIET  Total  caloric  intake  per  capita  increases  as  countries  develop. 
With regard to CVD, a key element of dietary change is an increase in 
intake of saturated animal fats and hydrogenated vegetable fats, which 
contain atherogenic trans fatty acids, along with a decrease in intake of 
plant-based foods and an increase in simple carbohydrates. Fat contrib-
utes <20% of calories in rural China and India, <30% in Japan, and well 
above 30% in the United States. Caloric contributions from fat appear 
to be falling in the HICs.

PHYSICAL  INACTIVITY  The  increased  mechanization  that  accompa-
nies the economic transition leads to a shift from physically demanding, 
agriculture-based work to largely sedentary industry- and office-based 
work.  Physical  inactivity  is  responsible  for  1.3  million  global  deaths 
annually.  The  global  prevalence  of  physical  inactivity  has  remained 
steady between 2001 and 2016 (28.5% to 27.5%). In the United States, 
approximately one-quarter of the adult population does not participate

1814 in any leisure-time physical activity, and only 24.3% of adults reported 
participating in adequate leisure-time aerobic and muscle-strengthening  
activity to meet federal guidelines. Physical inactivity is similarly high 
in  other  regions  of  the  world  and  is  increasing  in  countries  that  are 
rapidly urbanizing as part of their economic transition. Mortality rates 
attributable  to  inactivity  are  highest  in  North  Africa  and  the  Middle 
East and in Central and Eastern Europe. In urban China, for example, 
the  proportion  of  adults  who  participate  in  moderate-  or  high-level 
activity  has  decreased  significantly,  whereas  the  proportion  of  those 
who participate in low-level activity has increased.
 ■ METABOLIC RISK FACTORS
Examination  of  trends  in  metabolic  risk  factors  provides  insight  into 
changes in the CVD burden globally. Here we describe four metabolic 
risk factors—lipid levels, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus—
using  data  from  the  Global  Burden  of  Disease,  Injuries,  and  Risk 
Factors Study (GBD 2017). The GBD project identified and compiled 
mortality and morbidity data from 195 countries from 1980 to 2017.

Lipid  Levels  Worldwide,  high  cholesterol  levels  are  estimated  to 
play a role in 42% of ischemic heart disease deaths and 9% of stroke 
deaths,  amounting  to  4.3  million  deaths  annually.  Although  mean 
population  plasma  cholesterol  levels  tend  to  rise  as  countries  move 
through  the  epidemiologic  transition,  mean  serum  total  cholesterol 
levels have decreased globally between 1980 and 2008 by 0.08 mmol/L 
per  decade  in  men  and  0.07  mmol/L  per  decade  in  women.  Large 
declines occurred in Australasia, North America, and Western Europe 
(0.19–0.21  mmol/L).  Countries  in  the  East  Asia  and  Pacific  region 
experienced  increases  of  >0.08  mmol/L  in  both  men  and  women. 
More recent research including Mendelian studies suggests that lipo-
protein(a) may act as an individual predictor of CVD risk beyond tra-
ditional total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol through increased 
cellular  lipid  accumulation,  endothelial  dysfunction,  and  impacts  on 
coagulation.  It  appears  to  be  elevated  in  ~20%  of  the  global  popula-
tion, although fewer data are available from LMICs. Nonrandomized 
data  suggest  higher  rates  among  those  of  African  descent  with  twice 
the  levels  of  Caucasians,  with  East  Asians  and  South  Asians  having 
intermediate levels. There are limited data on clinical agents that target 
lipoprotein(a),  although  PCSK9  inhibitors  lower  it  or  other  specific 
targets, so this remains an area of intense research.

Hypertension  Elevated blood pressure is an early indicator of the 
epidemiologic transition. Observational studies show increased risk of 
CVD beginning with systolic blood pressures (SBPs) >110–115 mmHg. 
Between 1990 and 2015, the global prevalence of SBP ≥110–115 mmHg 
increased from 73,119 to 81,373 per 100,000, whereas the prevalence 
of SBP ≥140 mmHg rose from 17,307 to 20,526 per 100,000. In 2015, 
of  the  estimated  3.47  billion  adults  with  SBP  ≥110–115  mmHg,  874 
million (25%) had SBP ≥140 mmHg. While SBP ≥140 mmHg accounts 
for  only  25%  of  those  with  elevated  blood  pressure,  it  accounted  for 
73% (7.8 million) of deaths due to SBP of ≥110–115 mmHg in 2015. 
Worldwide,  55%  of  stroke  deaths  (3.36  of  6.17  million)  and  55%  of 
CHD deaths (4.89 of 8.93 million) are attributable to high blood pres-
sure, accounting for 8.25 million deaths in 2017. From 1990 to 2015, 
the number of deaths related to SBP ≥140 mmHg increased in all LMIC 
groups but fell in HICs. Between 1980 and 2008, the age-standardized 
prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension decreased even as the number 
of people with uncontrolled hypertension increased due to population 
growth and aging. Rising mean population blood pressure also occurs 
as populations industrialize and move from rural to urban settings. For 
example, the prevalence of hypertension in urban India is 33.8%, but 
varies between 14.5 and 31.7% in rural regions. One major concern in 
LMICs is the high rate of undetected, and therefore untreated, hyper-
tension.  This  may  explain,  at  least  in  part,  the  higher  stroke  rates  in 
these countries in relation to CHD rates during the early stages of the 
transition. The high rates of hypertension throughout Asia, especially 
undiagnosed hypertension, likely contribute to the high prevalence of 
hemorrhagic  stroke  in  the  region.  Globally,  however,  mean  SBP  has 
decreased for both sexes (0.8 mmHg per decade for men; 1.0 mmHg 
per decade for women).

Obesity 
In 2015, an estimated 603.4 million adults and 107.7 million 
children  were  obese.  Global  obesity  prevalence  was  12.0%  among 
adults (5.0% among children) and is increasing throughout the world, 
particularly in developing countries where the trajectories are steeper 
than  those  experienced  by  the  developed  countries.  High  body  mass 
index (BMI) contributed to 4.0 million deaths worldwide (7.1% deaths 
from any cause); CVD was the leading cause of these deaths (2.7 million) 
and also of associated DALYs (66.3 of 120 million) followed by diabetes 
(0.6 million deaths, 30.4 million DALYs). Women are more affected by 
obesity  than  men;  from  1975  to  2014,  global  mean  age-standardized 
BMI increased from 22.1 to 24.4 kg/m2 in females and from 21.7 to 24.2 
kg/m2 in males, whereas the prevalence of obesity increased from 6.4% 
to  14.9%  in  females  and  3.2%  to  10.8%  in  males.  The  proportion  of 
the world’s adult women who are either overweight or obese rose from 
29.8% to 38.0% between 1980 and 2013, while an increase from 28.8% 
to  36.9%  was  observed  for  men.  Country  and  regional  differences 
are observed. The highest prevalence of male obesity is in the United 
States, Southern and Central Latin America, Australasia, and Central 
and Western Europe. For females, the highest prevalence of obesity is 
in Southern and North Africa, the Middle East, Central and Southern 
Latin America, and the United States. The lowest prevalence for both 
males and females was observed in South and Southeast Asia and in 
East,  Central,  and  West  Africa.  Generally,  the  prevalence  of  obesity 
for both sexes increased with the increase in sociodemographic index; 
however,  the  rise  in  adult  obesity  in  developed  countries  has  slowed 
since  2006.  In  many  of  the  LMICs,  obesity  appears  to  coexist  with 
undernutrition and malnutrition. Adolescents are at particular risk.

Diabetes Mellitus  As a consequence of, or in addition to, increas-
ing BMI and decreasing levels of physical activity, worldwide rates of 
diabetes—predominantly type 2 diabetes—are on the rise. According 
to the most recent data from the GBD project, the prevalence of diabe-
tes increased 129.7% for males and 120.9% for females between 1990 
and 2017. An estimated 476 million people worldwide have diabetes, 
and  the  International  Diabetes  Foundation  predicts  this  number  will 
reach  693  million  by  2045.  Nearly  50%  of  people  with  diabetes  are 
undiagnosed,  and  80%  live  in  LMICs.  The  Middle  East  and  North 
Africa  have  the  highest  regional  age-standardized  prevalence  (8.7% 
of  the  population)  and  incidence  rates  (400  per  100,000)  of  diabe-
tes,  whereas  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  has  the  lowest  (5.8%;  249  per 
100,000). Future growth will also largely occur in the Middle East and 
Africa, along with other LMICs in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

 ■ GENETIC RISK FACTORS
A great deal of effort has recently been invested in understanding how 
genes  affect  cardiovascular  health  in  populations.  These  efforts  have 
focused on germline genetic variants that are related to specific CVDs as 
well as those that are associated with cardiovascular risk factors. In both 
cases, every year, the number of associated variants has increased mean-
ingfully to the point that it appears that hundreds or even thousands of 
variants are associated with these conditions, each explaining a small 
amount of the population variability in disease and risk factors. Collec-
tions of variants have been combined in polygenomic risk scores, but 
these too explain only a small amount of the variability of the disease 
in  the  population.  Much  more  data  will  emerge  in  the  coming  years 
about  these  associations,  the  mechanisms  that  explain  these  associa-
tions,  the  relationships  of  variants  that  are  specific  to  certain  tissues 
such  as  the  heart  or  the  brain,  and  the  interactions  between  genetic 
and lifestyle factors in causing disease. Currently, most of the data are 
among those with European ancestry; however, large-scale efforts are 
underway to understand the relationships between genes and diseases 
and  their  risk  factors  around  the  world.  The  early  data  suggest  non-
trivial differences among various world populations. Beyond germline 
risk, there appears to be increased cardiovascular risk associated with 
age-related expansion of hematopoietic clones with somatic mutations, 
including  loss-of-function  alleles  of  certain  genes.  Individuals  with 
these mutations without other hematologic abnormalities are defined 
as  having  clonal  hematopoiesis  of  indeterminate  potential  (CHIP).

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular SystemRecent studies suggest those with CHIP have up to a twofold increased 
risk of developing CHD.

SUMMARY
Although CVD rates are declining in the HICs, they are increasing in 
many other regions of the world. The consequences of this preventable 
epidemic will be substantial on many levels, including individual mor-
tality and morbidity, family suffering, and staggering economic costs.

Three  complementary  strategies  can  be  used  to  lessen  the  impact. 
First,  the  overall  burden  of  CVD  risk  factors  can  be  lowered  through  
population-wide  public  health  measures,  such  as  national  campaigns 
against cigarette smoking, unhealthy diets, and physical inactivity. Second, 
it is important to identify higher risk subgroups of the population who 
stand  to  benefit  the  most  from  specific,  low-cost  prevention  interven-
tions, including screening for and treatment of hypertension and elevated 
cholesterol.  Simple,  low-cost  interventions,  such  as  the  “polypill”—a 
regimen of aspirin, a statin, and an antihypertensive agent—also need 
to be explored. Third, resources should be allocated to acute, as well 
as  secondary,  prevention  interventions.  For  countries  with  limited 
resources,  a  critical  first  step  in  developing  a  comprehensive  plan  is 
better assessment of cause-specific mortality and morbidity, as well as 
the prevalence, of the major preventable risk factors.

In  the  meantime,  the  HICs  must  continue  to  bear  the  burden  of 
research  and  development  aimed  at  prevention  and  treatment,  being 
mindful of the economic limitations of many countries. The concept 
of the epidemiologic transition provides insight into how to alter the 
course  of  the  CVD  epidemic.  The  efficient  transfer  of  low-cost  pre-
ventive and therapeutic strategies could alter the natural course of this 
epidemic and thereby reduce the excess global burden of preventable 
CVD.

Patrick T. O’Gara, Joseph Loscalzo

The  approach  to  a  patient  with  known  or  suspected  cardiovascular 
disease begins with the time-honored traditions of a directed history 
and  a  targeted  physical  examination.  The  scope  of  these  activities 
depends  on  the  clinical  context  at  the  time  of  presentation,  ranging 
from  an  elective  ambulatory  follow-up  visit  to  a  more  urgent  emer-
gency  department  encounter.  There  has  been  a  gradual  decline  in

physical examination skills over the past few decades at every level, from  
student  to  faculty  specialist,  a  development  of  great  concern  to  both  
clinicians  and  medical  educators.  Classic  cardiac  findings  are  rec-
ognized  by  only  a  minority  of  internal  medicine  and  family  practice 
residents. Despite popular perceptions, clinical performance does not 
improve predictably as a function of experience; instead, the acquisi-
tion of new examination skills may become more difficult for a busy 
individual practitioner. Less time is now devoted to mentored cardio-
vascular  examinations  during  the  training  of  students  and  residents. 
One widely recognized outcome of these trends is the progressive over-
utilization of noninvasive imaging studies to establish the presence and 
severity of cardiovascular disease even when the examination findings 
imply a low pretest probability of significant pathology. Proponents of 
the  use  of  hand-held  ultrasound  devices  to  identify  and  characterize 
structural  cardiac  disease  have  called  for  its  incorporation  into  edu-
cational  curricula.  Techniques  to  improve  bedside  examination  skills 
include  repetition,  patient-centered  teaching  conferences,  visual  dis-
play feedback of auscultatory events using Doppler echocardiographic 
imaging, and simulation-based training.

The  evidence  base  that  links  the  findings  from  the  history  and 
physical  examination  to  the  presence,  severity,  and  prognosis  of  car-
diovascular disease has been established most rigorously for coronary 
artery  disease,  heart  failure,  and  valvular  heart  disease.  For  example, 
observations regarding heart rate, blood pressure, signs of pulmonary 
congestion, and the presence of mitral regurgitation (MR) contribute 
importantly to bedside risk assessment in patients with acute coronary 
syndromes.  Observations  from  the  physical  examination  in  this  set-
ting can inform clinical decision-making before the results of cardiac 
biomarker testing are known. The prognosis of patients with systolic 
heart failure can be predicted on the basis of the jugular venous pres-
sure  (JVP)  and  the  presence  or  absence  of  a  third  heart  sound  (S3). 
Accurate  characterization  of  cardiac  murmurs  provides  important 
insight into the natural history of many valvular and congenital heart 
lesions. Finally, the important role played by the physical examination 
in enhancing the clinician-patient relationship cannot be overstated.

 ■ THE GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Any examination begins with an assessment of the general appearance 
of  the  patient,  with  notation  of  age,  posture,  demeanor,  and  overall 
health  status.  Is  the  patient  in  pain  or  resting  quietly,  dyspneic  or 
diaphoretic? Does the patient choose to avoid certain body positions 
to  reduce  or  eliminate  pain,  as  might  be  the  case  with  suspected 
acute pericarditis? Are there clues indicating that dyspnea may have a 
pulmonary cause, such as a barrel chest deformity with an increased 
anterior-posterior diameter, tachypnea, and pursed-lip breathing? Skin 
pallor, cyanosis, and jaundice can be appreciated readily and provide 
additional  clues.  The  appearance  of  a  chronically  ill-appearing  ema-
ciated patient may suggest the presence of long-standing heart failure 
or  another  systemic  disorder,  such  as  a  malignancy.  Various  genetic 
syndromes,  often  with  cardiovascular  involvement,  can  also  be  rec-
ognized easily, such as trisomy 21, Marfan syndrome, and Holt-Oram 
syndrome. Height and weight should be measured routinely, and both 
body mass index and body surface area should be calculated. Knowl-
edge of the waist circumference and the waist-to-hip ratio can be used 
to predict long-term cardiovascular risk. Mental status, level of alert-
ness, and mood should be assessed continuously during the interview 
and examination.

Skin  Central  cyanosis  occurs  with  significant  right-to-left  shunt-
ing at the level of the heart or lungs, allowing deoxygenated blood to 
reach  the  systemic  circulation.  Peripheral  cyanosis  or  acrocyanosis, 
in contrast, is usually related to reduced extremity blood flow due to 
small vessel constriction, as seen in patients with severe heart failure, 
shock, or peripheral vascular disease; it can be aggravated by the use 
of β-adrenergic blockers with unopposed α-mediated vasoconstriction. 
Differential  cyanosis  refers  to  isolated  cyanosis  affecting  the  lower 
but  not  the  upper  extremities  in a  patient  with  a  large  patent  ductus 
arteriosus (PDA) and secondary pulmonary hypertension with right-
to-left to shunting at the great vessel level. Telangiectasias on the lips,

1816 tongue,  and  mucous  membranes,  as  part  of  the  Osler-Weber-Rendu 
syndrome  (hereditary  hemorrhagic  telangiectasia),  resemble  spider 
nevi  and  can  be  a  source  of  right-to-left  shunting  when  also  pres-
ent  in  the  lung.  Malar  telangiectasias  also  are  seen  in  patients  with 
advanced  mitral  stenosis  (MS)  or  scleroderma.  An  unusually  tan  or 
bronze discoloration of the skin may suggest hemochromatosis as the 
cause of the associated systolic heart failure. Jaundice, which may be 
visible  first  in  the  sclerae,  has  a  broad  differential  diagnosis  but,  in 
the  appropriate  setting,  can  be  consistent  with  advanced  right  heart 
failure and congestive hepatomegaly. Various hereditary lipid disorders 
sometimes  are  associated  with  subcutaneous  xanthomas,  particularly 
along the tendon sheaths or over the extensor surfaces of the extremities. 
Severe hypertriglyceridemia can be associated with eruptive xanthoma-
tosis  and  lipemia  retinalis.  Palmar  crease  xanthomas  are  specific  for 
type  III  hyperlipoproteinemia.  Pseudoxanthoma  elasticum,  a  disease 
associated with premature atherosclerosis, is manifested by a leathery, 
cobblestoned appearance of the skin in the axilla and neck creases and 
by angioid streaks on funduscopic examination. Extensive lentiginoses 
have been described in a variety of development delay–cardiovascular 
syndromes,  including  Carney’s  syndrome,  which  includes  multiple 
atrial myxomas. Cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis such as lupus 
pernio  and  erythema  nodosum  may  suggest  this  disease  as  a  cause 
of  an  associated  dilated  cardiomyopathy,  especially  with  heart  block, 
intraventricular conduction delay, or ventricular tachycardia.

Head and Neck  Dentition and oral hygiene should be assessed in 
every patient both as a source of potential infection and as an index of 
general health. A high-arched palate is a feature of Marfan syndrome 
and  other  connective  tissue  disease  syndromes.  Bifid  uvula  has  been 
described in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and orange tonsils 
are  characteristic  of  Tangier  disease.  The  ocular  manifestations  of 
hyperthyroidism  have  been  well  described.  Many  patients  with  con-
genital  heart  disease  have  associated  hypertelorism,  low-set  ears,  or 
micrognathia.  Blue  sclerae  are  a  feature  of  osteogenesis  imperfecta. 
An arcus senilis pattern lacks specificity as an index of coronary heart 
disease  risk.  The  funduscopic  examination  is  an  often-underused 
method  by  which  to  assess  the  microvasculature,  especially  among 
patients  with  established  atherosclerosis,  hypertension,  or  diabetes 
mellitus.  A  mydriatic  agent  may  be  necessary  for  optimal  visualiza-
tion.  A  funduscopic  examination  should  be  performed  routinely  in 
the assessment of patients with suspected endocarditis and those with 
a  history  of  acute  visual  change.  Branch  retinal  artery  occlusion  or 
visualization of a Hollenhorst plaque can narrow the differential diag-
nosis rapidly in the appropriate setting. Relapsing polychondritis may 
manifest as an inflamed pinna or, in its later stages, as a saddle-nose 
deformity  because  of  destruction  of  nasal  cartilage;  granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) can also lead to a saddle-nose deformity.

Chest  Midline  sternotomy,  left  posterolateral  thoracotomy,  or 
infraclavicular  scars  at  the  site  of  pacemaker/defibrillator  generator 
implantation should not be overlooked and may provide the first clue 
regarding an underlying cardiovascular disorder in patients unable to 
provide a relevant history. A prominent venous collateral pattern may 
suggest  subclavian  or  vena  caval  obstruction.  If  the  head  and  neck 
appear dusky and slightly cyanotic and the venous pressure is grossly 
elevated without visible pulsations, a diagnosis of superior vena cava 
syndrome  should  be  entertained.  Thoracic  cage  abnormalities  have 
been  well  described  among  patients  with  connective  tissue  disease 
syndromes. They include pectus carinatum (“pigeon chest”) and pec-
tus excavatum (“funnel chest”). Obstructive lung disease is suggested 
by  a  barrel  chest  deformity,  especially  with  tachypnea,  pursed-lip 
breathing, and use of accessory muscles. The characteristically severe 
kyphosis and compensatory lumbar, pelvic, and knee flexion of anky-
losing spondylitis should prompt careful auscultation for a murmur of 
aortic regurgitation (AR). Straight back syndrome refers to the loss of 
the normal kyphosis of the thoracic spine and has been described in 
patients  with  mitral  valve  prolapse  (MVP)  and  its  variants.  In  some 
patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, the chest wall appears 
to be asymmetric, with anterior displacement of the left hemithorax. 

The respiratory rate and pattern should be noted during spontaneous 
breathing,  with  additional  attention  to  depth,  audible  wheezing,  and 
stridor. Lung examination can reveal adventitious sounds indicative of 
pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or pleuritis.

Abdomen 
In  some  patients  with  advanced  obstructive  lung  dis-
ease, the point of maximal cardiac impulse may be in the epigastrium. 
The  liver  is  frequently  enlarged  and  tender  in  patients  with  chronic 
heart  failure.  Systolic  pulsations  over  the  liver  signify  severe  tricus-
pid  regurgitation  (TR).  Splenomegaly  may  be  a  feature  of  infective 
endocarditis,  particularly  when  symptoms  have  persisted  for  weeks 
or  months.  Ascites  is  a  nonspecific  finding  but  may  be  present  with 
advanced chronic right heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, hepatic 
cirrhosis, or an intraperitoneal malignancy. The finding of an elevated 
JVP implies a cardiovascular etiology. In nonobese patients, the aorta 
typically is palpated between the epigastrium and the umbilicus. The 
sensitivity of palpation for the detection of an abdominal aortic aneu-
rysm  (pulsatile  and  expansile  mass)  decreases  as  a  function  of  body 
size.  Because  palpation  alone  is  not  sufficiently  accurate  to  establish 
this  diagnosis,  a  screening  ultrasound  examination  is  advised  when 
appropriate. The presence of an arterial bruit over the abdomen sug-
gests high-grade atherosclerotic disease, although precise localization 
is difficult.

Extremities  The  temperature  and  color  of  the  extremities,  the 
presence of clubbing, arachnodactyly, and pertinent nail findings can 
be  surmised  quickly  during  the  examination.  Clubbing  implies  the 
presence  of  central  right-to-left  shunting,  although  it  has  also  been 
described in patients with endocarditis. Its appearance can range from 
cyanosis  and  softening  of  the  root  of  the  nail  bed,  to  the  classic  loss 
of the normal angle between the base of the nail and the skin, to the 
skeletal and periosteal bony changes of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, 
which  is  seen  rarely  in  patients  with  advanced  lung  or  liver  disease. 
Patients  with  the  Holt-Oram  syndrome  have  an  unopposable,  “fin-
gerized”  thumb,  whereas  patients  with  Marfan  syndrome  may  have 
arachnodactyly and a positive “wrist” (overlapping of the thumb and 
fifth  finger  around  the  wrist)  or  “thumb”  (protrusion  of  the  thumb 
beyond the ulnar aspect of the hand when the fingers are clenched over 
the thumb in a fist) sign. The Janeway lesions of endocarditis are non-
tender,  slightly  raised  hemorrhages  on  the  palms  and  soles,  whereas 
Osler’s nodes are tender, raised nodules on the pads of the fingers or 
toes. Splinter hemorrhages are classically identified as linear petechiae 
in the midposition of the nail bed and should be distinguished from 
the  more  common  traumatic  petechiae,  which  are  seen  closer  to  the 
distal edge.

Lower extremity or presacral edema in the setting of an elevated JVP 
defines volume overload and may be a feature of chronic heart failure 
or  constrictive  pericarditis.  Lower  extremity  edema  in  the  absence 
of  jugular  venous  hypertension  may  be  due  to  profound  hypoalbu-
minemia as seen in nephrotic syndrome or liver failure. Other causes 
include lymphatic or venous obstruction or, more commonly, venous 
insufficiency, as would be further suggested by the appearance of var-
icosities,  venous  ulcers  (typically  medial  in  location),  and  brownish 
cutaneous  discoloration  from  hemosiderin  deposition  (eburnation). 
Pitting  edema  can  also  be  seen  in  patients  who  use  dihydropyridine 
calcium channel blockers. A Homan’s sign (posterior calf pain on active 
dorsiflexion of the foot against resistance) is neither specific nor sen-
sitive for deep venous thrombosis. Muscular atrophy or the absence of 
hair along an extremity is consistent with severe arterial insufficiency 
or a primary neuromuscular disorder.

 ■ CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION
Jugular Venous Pressure and Waveform  The JVP is the single 
most important bedside measurement from which to estimate the vol-
ume status. The internal jugular vein is preferred because the external 
jugular vein is valved and not directly in line with the superior vena 
cava and right atrium. Nevertheless, the external jugular vein has been 
used  to  discriminate  between  high  and  low  central  venous  pressure 
(CVP) when tested among medical students, residents, and attending

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemphysicians.  Precise  estimation  of  the  central  venous  or  right  atrial 
pressure from bedside assessment of the jugular venous waveform has 
proved  difficult.  Venous  pressure  traditionally  has  been  measured  as 
the vertical distance between the top of the jugular venous pulsation 
and the sternal inflection point (angle of Louis). A distance >4.5 cm 
at 30° elevation is considered abnormal. However, the actual distance 
between the mid-right atrium and the angle of Louis varies consider-
ably as a function of both body size and the patient angle at which the 
assessment is made (30°, 45°, or 60°). The use of the sternal angle as a 
reference point leads to systematic underestimation of CVP, and this 
method should be used less for semiquantification than to distinguish 
a  normal  from  an  abnormally  elevated  CVP.  The  use  of  the  clavicle 
may provide an easier reference for standardization. Venous pulsations 
above this level in the sitting position are clearly abnormal, as the dis-
tance between the clavicle and the right atrium is at least 10 cm. The 
patient  should  always  be  placed  in  the  sitting  position,  with  the  legs 
dangling below the bedside, when an elevated pressure is suspected in 
the semisupine position. It should also be noted that bedside estimates 
of  CVP  are  made  in  centimeters  of  water,  but  must  be  converted  to 
millimeters of mercury to provide correlation with accepted hemody-
namic norms (1.36 cmH2O = 1.0 mmHg).

The venous waveform sometimes can be difficult to distinguish from 
the carotid pulse, especially during casual inspection. Nevertheless, the 
venous waveform has several characteristic features, and its individual 
components  can  be  appreciated  in  most  patients  (Fig.  239-1).  The 
arterial  pulsation  is  not  easily  obliterated  with  palpation;  the  venous 
waveform in patients with sinus rhythm is usually biphasic, while the 
carotid pulse is monophasic; and the jugular venous pulsation should 
change with changes in posture or inspiration (unless the venous pres-
sure is quite elevated).

The  venous  waveform  is  divided  into  several  distinct  peaks.  The  
a wave reflects right atrial presystolic contraction and occurs just after 
the electrocardiographic P wave, preceding the first heart sound (S1). 
A prominent a wave is seen in patients with reduced right ventricular 
compliance; a cannon a wave occurs with atrioventricular (AV) disso-
ciation and right atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid valve. In a 
patient with a wide complex tachycardia, the appreciation of cannon a 
waves in the jugular venous waveform identifies the rhythm as ventric-
ular in origin. The a wave is not present with atrial fibrillation. The x 
descent defines the fall in right atrial pressure after inscription of the a 
wave. The c wave, which occurs as the closed tricuspid valve is pushed 
into  the  right  atrium  during  early  ventricular  systole,  interrupts  this 
x descent and is followed by a further descent. The v wave represents 
atrial filling (atrial diastole) and occurs during ventricular systole. The 
height of the v wave is determined by right atrial compliance as well 
as the volume of blood returning to the right atrium either antegrade 
from the cavae or retrograde through an incompetent tricuspid valve. 
In patients with TR, the v wave is accentuated and the subsequent fall 
in  pressure  (y  descent)  is  rapid.  With  progressive  degrees  of  TR,  the 
v  wave  merges  with  the  c  wave,  and  the  right  atrial  and  jugular  vein 
waveforms become “ventricularized.” The y descent, which follows the 
peak of the v wave, can become prolonged or blunted with obstruction 
to  right  ventricular  inflow,  as  may  occur  with  tricuspid  stenosis  or 
pericardial  tamponade.  Normally,  the  venous  pressure  should  fall  by 
at least 3 mmHg with inspiration. Kussmaul’s sign is defined by either 
a  rise  or  a  lack  of  fall  of  the  JVP  with  inspiration  and  is  classically 
associated with constrictive pericarditis, although it has been reported 
in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, massive pulmonary embo-
lism,  right  ventricular  infarction,  and  advanced  left  ventricular  (LV) 
systolic heart failure. It is also a common, isolated finding in patients 
after cardiac surgery without other hemodynamic abnormalities.

Venous hypertension sometimes can be elicited by passive leg eleva-
tion or performance of the abdominojugular reflux maneuver. When 
these signs are positive, a volume-overloaded state with limited com-
pliance of an overly distended or constricted venous system is present. 
Abdominojugular reflux is produced with firm and consistent pressure 
over the upper portion of the abdomen, preferably over the right upper 
quadrant, for >15 s. A positive response is defined by a sustained rise 
of >3 cm in the JVP during the application of firm abdominal pressure.

FIGURE 239-1  A. Jugular venous pulse wave tracing (top) with heart sounds (bottom) 
in a patient with reduced right ventricular compliance. The A wave represents right 
atrial presystolic contraction and occurs just after the electrocardiographic P wave 
and just before the first heart sound (I). In this example, the A wave is accentuated 
and  larger  than  normal  due  to  decreased  right  ventricular  compliance,  as  also 
suggested by the right-sided S4 (IV). The C wave may reflect the carotid pulsation 
in  the  neck  and/or  an  early  systolic  increase  in  right  atrial  pressure  as  the  right 
ventricle  pushes  the  closed  tricuspid  valve  into  the  right  atrium.  The  x  descent 
follows the A wave just as atrial pressure continues to fall. The V wave represents 
atrial  filling  during  ventricular  systole  and  peaks  at  the  second  heart  sound  (II). 
The y descent corresponds to the fall in right atrial pressure after tricuspid valve 
opening. B. Jugular venous wave forms in mild (middle) and severe (top) tricuspid 
regurgitation, compared with normal, with phonocardiographic representation of the 
corresponding heart sounds below. With increasing degrees of tricuspid regurgitation,

Diagnosis, 2nd ed. Boston, Butterworth Heinemann, 2001.)

The response should be assessed after 10 s of continuous pressure to 
allow for respiratory artifacts and tensing of the abdominal muscles to 
subside.  Patients  must  be  coached  to  refrain  from  breath  holding  or 
a  Valsalva-like  maneuver  during  the  procedure.  Performance  of  the 
abdominojugular reflux maneuver is useful in predicting a pulmonary 
artery wedge pressure >15 mmHg in patients with heart failure.

Although the JVP estimates right ventricular filling pressure, it has  
a predictable relationship with the pulmonary artery wedge pressure.

1818 In a large study of patients with advanced heart failure, the presence 
of a right atrial pressure >10 mmHg (as predicted on bedside exami-
nation) had a positive value of 88% for the prediction of a pulmonary 
artery wedge pressure of >22 mmHg. In addition, an elevated JVP has 
prognostic significance in patients with both symptomatic heart failure 
and asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction. The presence of an elevated 
JVP is associated with a higher risk of subsequent hospitalization for 
heart failure, death from heart failure, or both.

Assessment of Blood Pressure  Measurement of blood pressure 
usually  is  delegated  to  a  medical  assistant  but  should  be  repeated  by 
the  examining  clinician.  Accurate  measurement  depends  on  body 
position, arm size, time of measurement, place of measurement, device, 
device  size,  technique,  and  examiner.  In  general,  physician-recorded 
blood  pressures  are  higher  than  both  nurse-recorded  pressures  and 
self-recorded  pressures  at  home.  Blood  pressure  is  best  measured  in 
the seated position with the arm at the level of the heart and the feet 
on  the  floor  with  the  back  supported,  using  an  appropriately  sized 
cuff, after 5–10 min of relaxation. When it is measured in the supine 
position, the arm should be raised to bring it to the level of the mid-
right atrium. The length and width of the blood pressure cuff bladder 
should  be  80  and  40%  of  the  arm’s  circumference,  respectively.  A 
common source of error in practice is to use an inappropriately small 
cuff, resulting in marked overestimation of true blood pressure, or an 
inappropriately large cuff, resulting in underestimation of true blood 
pressure. The cuff should be inflated to 30 mmHg above the expected 
systolic  pressure  and  the  pressure  released  at  a  rate  of  2–3  mmHg/s. 
Systolic and diastolic pressures are defined by the first and fifth Korot-
koff  sounds,  respectively.  Very  low  (even  0  mmHg)  diastolic  blood  
pressures may be recorded in patients with chronic, severe AR or a large 
arteriovenous fistula because of enhanced diastolic “run-off.” In these 
instances, both the phase IV and phase V Korotkoff sounds should be 
recorded.  Blood  pressure  is  best  assessed  at  the  brachial  artery  level, 
though it can be measured at the radial, popliteal, or pedal pulse level. 
In general, systolic pressure increases and diastolic pressure decreases 
when measured in more distal arteries. Blood pressure should be mea-
sured in both arms, and the difference should be <10 mmHg. A blood 
pressure differential that exceeds this threshold may be associated with 
atherosclerotic or inflammatory subclavian artery disease, supravalvu-
lar aortic stenosis, aortic coarctation, or aortic dissection. Systolic leg 
pressures  are  usually  as  much  as  20  mmHg  higher  than  systolic  arm 
pressures.  Greater  leg–arm  pressure  differences  are  seen  in  patients 
with chronic severe AR as well as patients with extensive and calcified 
lower  extremity  peripheral  arterial  disease.  The  ankle-brachial  index 
(systolic  pressure  in  the  dorsalis  pedis  and/or  posterior  tibial  artery 
divided by the higher of the two brachial artery pressures) is a powerful 
predictor of long-term cardiovascular mortality.

The  blood  pressure  measured  in  an  office  or  hospital  setting  may 
not accurately reflect the pressure in other venues. “White coat hyper-
tension” (elevated clinic blood pressure and normal out of clinic blood 
pressure)  is  defined  by  at  least  three  separate  clinic-based  measure-
ments  >130/80  mmHg  and  at  least  two  non-clinic-based  measure-
ments <130/80 mmHg in the absence of any evidence of target organ 
damage.  Individuals  with  white  coat  hypertension  may  not  benefit 
from drug therapy, although they may be more likely to develop sus-
tained hypertension over time. Masked hypertension (normal or low 
clinic blood pressure but elevated out of clinic blood pressure) should 
be suspected when normal or even low blood pressures are recorded in 
the office in patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease, especially 
when evidence of target organ damage is present or bruits are audible. 
Higher  systolic  blood  pressures  measured  with  a  24-h  ambulatory 
blood  pressure  device  are  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  cardiovas-
cular disease and all-cause death independent of blood pressures mea-
sured in the outpatient setting.

Orthostatic  hypotension  is  defined  by  a  fall  in  systolic  pressure  
>20 mmHg or in diastolic pressure >10 mmHg in response to assump-
tion of the upright posture from a supine position within 3 min. There 
may also be a lack of a compensatory tachycardia, an abnormal response 
that suggests autonomic insufficiency, as may be seen in patients with 

diabetes  mellitus  or  Parkinson’s  disease.  Orthostatic  hypotension  is  a 
common  cause  of  postural  lightheadedness/syncope  and  should  be 
assessed routinely in patients for whom this diagnosis might pertain. It 
can be exacerbated by advanced age, dehydration, certain medications, 
food, deconditioning, and ambient temperature/humidity.

Arterial  Pulse  The  carotid  artery  pulse  occurs  just  after  the 
ascending  aortic  pulse.  The  aortic  pulse  is  best  appreciated  in  the 
epigastrium,  just  above  the  level  of  the  umbilicus.  Peripheral  arterial 
pulses  that  should  be  assessed  routinely  include  the  subclavian,  bra-
chial,  radial,  ulnar,  femoral,  popliteal,  dorsalis  pedis,  and  posterior 
tibial. In patients in whom the diagnosis of either temporal arteritis or 
polymyalgia rheumatica is suspected, the temporal arteries also should 
be examined. Although one of the two pedal pulses may not be pal-
pable in up to 10% of normal subjects, the pair should be symmetric. 
The integrity of the arcuate system of the hand is assessed by Allen’s 
test, which is performed routinely before instrumentation of the radial 
artery.  The  pulses  should  be  examined  for  their  symmetry,  volume, 
timing,  contour,  amplitude,  and  duration.  If  necessary,  simultaneous 
auscultation  of  the  heart  can  help  identify  a  delay  in  the  arrival  of 
an  arterial  pulse.  Simultaneous  palpation  of  the  radial  and  femoral 
pulses  may  reveal  a  femoral  delay  in  a  patient  with  upper  extremity 
hypertension and suspected aortic coarctation. The carotid upstrokes 
should  never  be  examined  simultaneously  or  before  listening  for  a 
bruit.  Light  pressure  should  always  be  used  to  avoid  precipitation  of 
carotid hypersensitivity syndrome and syncope in a susceptible elderly 
individual. The arterial pulse usually becomes more rapid and spiking 
as a function of its distance from the heart, a phenomenon that reflects 
the muscular status of the more peripheral arteries and the summation 
of the incident and reflected waves. In general, the character and con-
tour of the arterial pulse depend on the stroke volume, ejection veloc-
ity,  vascular  compliance,  and  systemic  vascular  resistance.  The  pulse 
examination can be misleading in patients with reduced cardiac output 
and in those with stiffened arteries from aging, chronic hypertension, 
or peripheral arterial disease.

The  character  of  the  pulse  is  best  appreciated  at  the  carotid  level 
(Fig. 239-2). A weak and delayed pulse (pulsus parvus et tardus) defines 
severe  aortic  stenosis  (AS).  Some  patients  with  AS  may  also  have  a 
slow,  notched,  or  interrupted  upstroke  (anacrotic  pulse)  with  a  thrill 
or shudder. With chronic severe AR, by contrast, the carotid upstroke 
has a sharp rise and rapid fall-off (Corrigan’s or water-hammer pulse). 
Some patients with advanced AR may have a bifid or bisferiens pulse, 
in  which  two  systolic  peaks  can  be  appreciated.  A  bifid  pulse  is  also 
described  in  patients  with  hypertrophic  obstructive  cardiomyopathy 
(HOCM), with inscription of percussion and tidal waves. A bifid pulse 
is easily appreciated in patients on intraaortic balloon counterpulsation 
(IABP), in whom the second pulse is diastolic in timing.

Pulsus paradoxus refers to a fall in systolic pressure >10 mmHg with 
inspiration that is seen in patients with pericardial tamponade but also 
is described in those with massive pulmonary embolism, hemorrhagic 
shock,  severe  obstructive  lung  disease,  and  tension  pneumothorax. 
Pulsus  paradoxus  is  measured  by  noting  the  difference  between 
the  systolic  pressure  at  which  the  Korotkoff  sounds  are  first  heard 
(during  expiration)  and  the  systolic  pressure  at  which  the  Korotkoff 
sounds are heard with each heartbeat, independent of the respiratory 
phase.  Between  these  two  pressures,  the  Korotkoff  sounds  are  heard 
only intermittently and during expiration. The cuff pressure must be 
decreased slowly to appreciate the finding. It can be difficult to mea-
sure pulsus paradoxus in patients with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or 
tachypnea. A pulsus paradoxus may be palpable at the brachial artery 
or femoral artery level when the pressure difference exceeds 15 mmHg. 
This inspiratory fall in systolic pressure is an exaggerated consequence 
of interventricular dependence.

Pulsus alternans, in contrast, is defined by beat-to-beat variability of 
pulse amplitude. It is present only when every other phase I Korotkoff 
sound  is  audible  as  the  cuff  pressure  is  lowered  slowly,  typically  in  a 
patient  with  a  regular  heart  rhythm  and  independent  of  the  respira-
tory cycle. Pulsus alternans is seen in patients with severe LV systolic 
dysfunction and is thought to be due to cyclic changes in intracellular

calcium  and  action  potential  duration.  When  pulsus  alternans  is 
associated with electrocardiographic T-wave alternans, the risk for an 
arrhythmic event appears to be increased.

Ascending aortic aneurysms can rarely be appreciated as a pulsatile 
mass in the right parasternal area. Appreciation of a prominent abdom-
inal aortic pulse should prompt noninvasive imaging with ultrasound 
or computed tomography for better characterization. Femoral and/or 
popliteal artery aneurysms should be sought in patients with abdomi-
nal aortic aneurysm disease.

The level of a claudication-producing arterial obstruction can often 
be identified on physical examination (Fig. 239-3). For example, in a 
patient with calf claudication, a decrease in pulse amplitude between 
the  common  femoral  and  popliteal  arteries  will  localize  the  obstruc-
tion  to  the  level  of  the  superficial  femoral  artery,  although  inflow 
obstruction above the level of the common femoral artery may coexist. 
Auscultation  for  carotid,  subclavian,  abdominal  aortic,  and  femoral 
artery bruits should be routine. However, the correlation between the 
presence of a bruit and the degree of vascular obstruction is poor. A 
cervical bruit is a weak indicator of the degree of carotid artery steno-
sis; the absence of a bruit does not exclude the presence of significant 
luminal obstruction. If a bruit extends into diastole or if a thrill is pres-
ent, the obstruction is usually severe. Another cause of an arterial bruit 
is an arteriovenous fistula with enhanced flow.

The  likelihood  of  significant  lower  extremity  peripheral  arterial 
disease  increases  with  typical  symptoms  of  claudication,  cool  skin, 
abnormalities on pulse examination, or the presence of a vascular bruit. 
Abnormal  pulse  oximetry  (a  >2%  difference  between  finger  and  toe 
oxygen  saturation)  can  be  used  to  detect  lower  extremity  peripheral 
arterial disease and is comparable in its performance characteristics to 
the ankle-brachial index.

Inspection  and  Palpation  of  the  Heart  The  LV  apex  beat 
may  be  visible  in  the  midclavicular  line  at  the  fifth  intercostal  space 
in  thin-chested  adults.  Visible  pulsations  anywhere  other  than  this 
expected location are abnormal. The left anterior chest wall may heave 
in  patients  with  an  enlarged  or  hyperdynamic  left  or  right  ventricle. 
As noted previously, a visible right upper parasternal pulsation may be 
suggestive of ascending aortic aneurysm disease. In thin, tall patients 
and  patients  with  advanced  obstructive  lung  disease  and  flattened 
diaphragms, the cardiac impulse may be visible in the epigastrium and 
should be distinguished from a pulsatile liver edge.

Palpation of the heart begins with the patient in the supine position 
at  30°  and  can  be  enhanced  by  placing  the  patient  in  the  left  lateral 
decubitus position. The normal LV impulse is <2 cm in diameter and 
moves  quickly  away  from  the  fingers;  it  is  better  appreciated  at  end 
expiration, with the heart closer to the anterior chest wall. Character-
istics such as size, amplitude, and rate of force development should be 
noted.

Enlargement of the LV cavity is manifested by a leftward and down-
ward displacement of an enlarged apex beat. A sustained apex beat is a 
sign of pressure overload, such as that which may be present in patients 
with AS or chronic hypertension. A palpable presystolic impulse cor-
responds  to  the  fourth  heart  sound  (S4)  and  is  indicative  of  reduced 
LV  compliance  and  the  forceful  contribution  of  atrial  contraction  to 
ventricular filling. A palpable third sound (S3), which is indicative of 
a rapid early filling wave in patients with heart failure, may be present 
even when the gallop itself is not audible. A large LV aneurysm may 
sometimes be palpable as an ectopic impulse, discrete from the apex 
beat. HOCM may very rarely cause a triple cadence beat at the apex 
with contributions from a palpable S4 and the two components of the 
bisferiens systolic pulse.

Right ventricular pressure or volume overload may create a sternal 
lift. Signs of either TR (cv waves in the jugular venous pulse) and/or 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (a loud single or palpable P2) would 
be  confirmatory.  The  right  ventricle  can  enlarge  to  the  extent  that 
left-sided events are obscured. A zone of retraction between the right 
ventricular and LV impulses sometimes can be appreciated in patients 
with right ventricle pressure or volume overload when they are placed 
in the left lateral decubitus position. Systolic and diastolic thrills signify 
turbulent  and  high-velocity  blood  flow.  Their  locations  help  identify 
the origin of heart murmurs.

 ■ CARDIAC AUSCULTATION
Heart Sounds  Ventricular systole is defined by the interval between 
the first (S1) and second (S2) heart sounds (Fig. 239-4). The first heart 
sound  (S1)  includes  mitral  and  tricuspid  valve  closure.  Normal  split-
ting can be appreciated in young patients and those with right bundle 
branch block, in whom tricuspid valve closure is relatively delayed. The 
intensity  of  S1  is  determined  by  the  distance  over  which  the  anterior 
leaflet of the mitral valve must travel to return to its annular plane, leaf-
let mobility, LV contractility, and the PR interval. S1 is classically loud 
in the early phases of rheumatic MS and in patients with hyperkinetic 
circulatory states or short PR intervals. S1 becomes softer in the later 
stages  of  MS  when  the  leaflets  are  rigid  and  calcified,  after  exposure 
to  β-adrenergic  receptor  blockers,  with  long  PR  intervals,  and  with 
LV  contractile  dysfunction.  The  intensity  of  heart  sounds,  however, 
can be reduced by any process that increases the distance between the 
stethoscope  and  the  responsible  cardiac  event,  including  mechanical 
ventilation,  obstructive  lung  disease,  obesity,  pneumothorax,  and  a 
pericardial effusion.

Aortic and pulmonic valve closure constitutes the second heart sound 
(S2). With normal or physiologic splitting, the A2–P2 interval increases 
with inspiration and narrows during expiration. This physiologic inter-
val will widen with right bundle branch block because of the further 
delay in pulmonic valve closure and in patients with severe MR because 
of  the  premature  closure  of  the  aortic  valve.  An  unusually  narrowly 
split  or  even  a  singular  S2  is  a  feature  of  pulmonary  arterial  hyper-
tension. Fixed splitting of S2, in which the A2–P2 interval is wide and 
does not change during the respiratory cycle, occurs in patients with a

secundum atrial septal defect (ASD). Reversed or paradoxical splitting 
refers to a pathologic delay in aortic valve closure, such as that which 
occurs in patients with left bundle branch block, right ventricular pac-
ing, severe AS, HOCM, and acute myocardial ischemia. With reversed 
or paradoxical splitting, the individual components of S2 are audible at 
end expiration, and their interval narrows with inspiration, the oppo-
site of what would be expected under normal physiologic conditions. 
P2 is considered loud when its intensity exceeds that of A2 at the base, 
when it can be palpated in the area of the proximal main pulmonary 
artery (second left interspace), or when both components of S2 can be 
appreciated at the lower left sternal border or apex. The intensity of A2 
and P2 decreases with AS and pulmonic stenosis (PS), respectively. In 
these conditions, a single S2 may result.
Systolic Sounds  An ejection sound is a high-pitched early systolic 
sound that corresponds in timing to the upstroke of the carotid pulse. 
It  usually  is  associated  with  congenital  bicuspid  aortic  or  pulmonic 
valve disease; however, ejection sounds are also sometimes audible in 
patients  with  isolated  aortic  or  pulmonary  root  dilation  and  normal 
semilunar valves. The ejection sound that accompanies bicuspid aortic 
valve disease becomes softer and then inaudible as the valve calcifies 
and  becomes  more  rigid.  The  ejection  sound  that  accompanies  PS 
moves  closer  to  the  first  heart  sound  as  the  severity  of  the  stenosis 
increases. In addition, the pulmonic ejection sound is the only right-
sided acoustic event that decreases in intensity with inspiration. Ejec-
tion sounds are often heard more easily at the lower left sternal border 
than  they  are  at  the  base.  Nonejection  sounds  (clicks),  which  occur 
after  the  onset  of  the  carotid  upstroke,  are  related  to  MVP  and  may 
be single or multiple. The nonejection click may introduce a murmur. 

This click-murmur complex will move away from the first heart sound 
with  maneuvers  that  increase  ventricular  preload,  such  as  squatting. 
On standing, the click and murmur move closer to S1.
Diastolic  Sounds  The  high-pitched  opening  snap  (OS)  of  MS 
occurs after a very short interval after the second heart sound. The A2–
OS interval is inversely proportional to the height of the left atrial–left 
ventricular diastolic pressure gradient. The intensity of both S1 and the 
OS of MS decreases with progressive calcification and rigidity of the 
anterior mitral leaflets. The pericardial knock (PK) is also high-pitched 
and  occurs  slightly  later  than  the  OS,  corresponding  in  timing  to  
the  abrupt  cessation  of  ventricular  expansion  after  tricuspid  valve 
opening  and  to  an  exaggerated  y  descent  seen  in  the  jugular  venous 
waveform  in  patients  with  constrictive  pericarditis.  A  tumor  plop  is 
a lower-pitched sound that rarely can be heard in patients with atrial 
myxoma.  It  may  be  appreciated  only  in  certain  positions  and  arises 
from the diastolic prolapse of the tumor across the mitral valve.

The third heart sound (S3) occurs during the rapid filling phase of 
ventricular diastole. It can be a normal finding in children, adolescents, 
and young adults; however, in older patients, it signifies heart failure. 
A left-sided S3 is a low-pitched sound best heard over the LV apex. A 
right-sided S3 is usually better heard over the lower left sternal border 
and becomes louder with inspiration. A left-sided S3 in patients with 
chronic  heart  failure  is  predictive  of  cardiovascular  morbidity  and 
mortality. Interestingly, an S3 is equally prevalent among heart failure 
patients with preserved and reduced LV ejection fraction.

The fourth heart sound (S4) occurs during the atrial filling phase of 
ventricular  diastole  and  indicates  LV  presystolic  expansion.  An  S4  is 
more common among patients who derive significant benefit from the

A midsystolic murmur begins after S1 and ends before S2; it is typi-
cally crescendo-decrescendo in configuration. AS is the most common 
cause of a midsystolic murmur in an adult. It is often difficult to esti-
mate the severity of the valve lesion on the basis of the physical exami-
nation findings, especially in older hypertensive patients with stiffened 
carotid  arteries  or  patients  with  low  cardiac  output  in  whom  the 
intensity of the systolic heart murmur is misleadingly soft. Examina-
tion findings consistent with severe AS would include parvus et tardus 
carotid upstrokes, a late-peaking grade 3 or greater midsystolic mur-
mur, a soft A2, a sustained LV apical impulse, and an S4. It is sometimes 
difficult  to  distinguish  aortic  sclerosis  from  more  advanced  degrees 
of valve stenosis. The former is defined by focal thickening and calci-
fication of the aortic valve leaflets that is not severe enough to result 
in obstruction. These valve changes are associated with a Doppler jet 
velocity across the aortic valve of 2.5 m/s or less. Patients with aortic 
sclerosis can have grade 2 or 3 midsystolic murmurs identical in their 
acoustic  characteristics  to  the  murmurs  heard  in  patients  with  more 
advanced degrees of AS. Other causes of a midsystolic heart murmur 
include pulmonic valve stenosis (with or without an ejection sound), 
HOCM, increased pulmonary blood flow in patients with a large ASD 
and  left-to-right  shunting,  and  several  states  associated  with  acceler-
ated blood flow in the absence of structural heart disease, such as fever, 
thyrotoxicosis, pregnancy, anemia, and normal childhood/adolescence.
The murmur of HOCM has features of both obstruction to LV out-
flow and MR, as would be expected from knowledge of the pathophys-
iology of this condition. The systolic murmur of HOCM usually can 
be distinguished from other causes on the basis of its response to bed-
side maneuvers, including Valsalva, passive leg raising, and standing/
squatting. In general, maneuvers that decrease LV preload (or increase 
LV contractility) will cause the murmur to intensify, whereas maneu-
vers that increase LV preload or afterload will cause a decrease in the 
intensity of the murmur. Accordingly, the systolic murmur of HOCM 
becomes louder during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver and 
after standing quickly from a squatting position. The murmur becomes

Cardiac Murmurs  Heart murmurs result from audible vibrations 
that are caused by increased turbulence and are defined by their timing 
within the cardiac cycle. Not all murmurs are indicative of structural 
heart disease, and the accurate identification of a benign or functional 
systolic  murmur  often  can  obviate  the  need  for  additional  testing  in 
healthy subjects. The duration, frequency, configuration, and intensity 
of a heart murmur are dictated by the magnitude, variability, and dura-
tion of the responsible pressure difference between two cardiac cham-
bers,  the  two  ventricles,  or  the  ventricles  and  their  respective  great 
arteries. The intensity of a heart murmur is graded on a scale of 1 to 6; 
a thrill is present with murmurs of grade 4 or greater intensity. Other 
attributes of the murmur that aid in its accurate identification include 
its location, radiation, and response to bedside maneuvers. Although 
clinicians can detect and correctly identify heart murmurs with only 
fair reliability, a careful and complete bedside examination usually can 
identify individuals with valvular heart disease for whom transthoracic 
echocardiography  and  clinical  follow-up  are  indicated  and  exclude 
subjects for whom no further evaluation is necessary.

Systolic murmurs can be early, mid, late, or holosystolic in timing 
(Fig. 239-5). Acute severe MR results in a decrescendo early systolic 
murmur,  the  characteristics  of  which  are  related  to  the  progressive 
attenuation  of  the  LV  to  left  atrial  pressure  gradient  during  systole 
because of the steep and rapid rise in left atrial pressure in this context. 
Severe  MR  associated  with  posterior  leaflet  prolapse  or  flail  radiates 
anteriorly and to the base, where it can be confused with the murmur 
of AS. MR that is due to anterior leaflet involvement radiates posteri-
orly and to the axilla. With acute TR in patients with normal pulmo-
nary  artery  pressures,  an  early  systolic  murmur  that  may  increase  in 
intensity with inspiration may be heard at the left lower sternal border, 
with regurgitant cv waves visible in the jugular venous pulse.

softer with passive leg raising and when squat-
ting. The murmur of AS is typically loudest in 
the second right interspace with radiation into 
the carotids, whereas the murmur of HOCM is 
best heard between the lower left sternal border 
and the apex. The murmur of PS is best heard 
in  the  second  left  interspace.  The  midsystolic 
murmur  associated  with  enhanced  pulmonic 
blood flow in the setting of a large ASD is usu-
ally loudest at the mid-left sternal border.

A  late  systolic  murmur,  heard  best  at  the 
apex,  indicates  MVP.  As  previously  noted,  the 
murmur  may  or  may  not  be  introduced  by  a 
nonejection  click.  Differential  radiation  of  the 
murmur,  as  previously  described,  may  help 
identify the specific leaflet involved by the myx-
omatous  process.  The  click-murmur  complex 
behaves  in  a  manner  directionally  similar  to 
that  demonstrated  by  the  murmur  of  HOCM 
during the Valsalva and stand/squat maneuvers  
(Fig. 239-6). The murmur of MVP can be iden-
tified by the accompanying nonejection click.

Holosystolic  murmurs  are  plateau  in  con-
figuration  and  reflect  a  continuous  and  wide 
pressure gradient between the left ventricle and 
left  atrium  with  chronic  MR,  the  left  ventricle 
and  right  ventricle  with  a  ventricular  septal 
defect (VSD), and the right ventricle and right 
atrium  with  TR.  In  contrast  to  acute  MR,  in 
chronic MR, the left atrium is enlarged and its 
compliance is normal or increased to the extent 
that there is little if any further increase in left 
atrial pressure from any increase in regurgitant 
volume. The murmur of MR is best heard over the cardiac apex. The 
intensity  of  the  murmur  increases  with  maneuvers  that  increase  LV 
afterload, such as sustained hand grip. The murmur of a VSD (without 
significant pulmonary hypertension) is holosystolic and loudest at the 
mid-left sternal border, where a thrill is usually present. The murmur 
of TR is loudest at the lower left sternal border, increases in intensity 
with  inspiration  (Carvallo’s  sign),  and  is  accompanied  by  visible  cv 
waves in the jugular venous wave form and, on occasion, by pulsatile 
hepatomegaly.

Diastolic Murmurs 
In contrast to some systolic murmurs, diastolic 
heart murmurs always signify structural heart disease (Fig. 239-5). The 
murmur associated with acute, severe AR is relatively soft and of short 
duration  because  of  the  rapid  rise  in  LV  diastolic  pressure  and  the 
progressive  diminution  of  the  aortic-LV  diastolic  pressure  gradient. 
In contrast, the murmur of chronic severe AR is classically heard as a 
decrescendo, blowing diastolic murmur along the left sternal border in 
patients  with  primary  valve  pathology  and  sometimes  along  the  right 
sternal  border  in  patients  with  primary  aortic  root  pathology.  With 
chronic AR, the pulse pressure is wide and the arterial pulses are bound-
ing  in  character.  These  signs  of  significant  diastolic  run-off  are  often 
absent in the acute phase. The murmur of pulmonic regurgitation is also 
heard along the left sternal border. It is most commonly due to pulmo-
nary hypertension and enlargement of the annulus of the pulmonic valve. 
S2 is single and loud and may be palpable. There is a right ventricular/ 
parasternal  lift  that  is  indicative  of  chronic  right  ventricular  pressure 
overload. A less impressive murmur of PR is present after repair of tetral-
ogy of Fallot or pulmonic valve atresia. In this postoperative setting, the 
murmur is softer and lower-pitched, and the severity of the accompany-
ing pulmonic regurgitation can be underestimated significantly.

MS is the classic cause of a mid- to late diastolic murmur, which is 
best heard over the apex in the left lateral decubitus position, is low-
pitched  or  rumbling,  and  is  introduced  by  an  OS  in  the  early  stages 
of the rheumatic disease process. Presystolic accentuation refers to an 
increase in the intensity of the murmur just before the first heart sound 
and occurs in patients with sinus rhythm. It is absent in patients with 

atrial fibrillation. The auscultatory findings in patients with rheumatic 
tricuspid stenosis typically are obscured by left-sided events, although 
they  are  similar  in  nature  to  those  described  in  patients  with  MS. 
“Functional”  mitral  or  tricuspid  stenosis  refers  to  the  generation  of 
mid-diastolic  murmurs  that  are  created  by  increased  and  accelerated 
transvalvular  diastolic  flow,  even  in  the  absence  of  valvular  obstruc-
tion, in the setting of severe MR, severe TR, or a large ASD with left-
to-right shunting. The Austin Flint murmur of chronic severe AR is a 
low-pitched mid- to late apical diastolic murmur that sometimes can 
be  confused  with  MS.  The  Austin  Flint  murmur  typically  decreases 
in  intensity  after  exposure  to  vasodilators,  whereas  the  murmur  of 
MS may be accompanied by an OS and also may increase in intensity 
after vasodilators because of the associated increase in cardiac output. 
Unusual  causes  of  a  mid-diastolic  murmur  include  atrial  myxoma, 
complete heart block, and acute rheumatic mitral valvulitis.

Continuous  Murmur  A  continuous  murmur  is  predicated  on  a 
pressure gradient that persists between two cardiac chambers or blood 
vessels across systole and diastole. The murmurs typically begin in sys-
tole, envelop the second heart sound (S2), and continue through some 
portion  of  diastole.  They  can  often  be  difficult  to  distinguish  from 
individual systolic and diastolic murmurs in patients with mixed val-
vular heart disease. The classic example of a continuous murmur is that 
associated with a PDA, which usually is heard in the second or third 
interspace at a slight distance from the sternal border. Other causes of 
a continuous murmur include a ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm 
with creation of an aortic–right atrial or right ventricular fistula, a cor-
onary or great vessel arteriovenous fistula, and an arteriovenous fistula 
constructed to provide dialysis access. There are two types of benign 
continuous murmurs. The cervical venous hum is heard in children or 
adolescents in the supraclavicular fossa. It can be obliterated with firm 
pressure applied to the diaphragm of the stethoscope, especially when 
the subject turns his or her head toward the examiner. The mammary 
soufflé  of  pregnancy  relates  to  enhanced  arterial  blood  flow  through 
engorged breasts. The diastolic component of the murmur can be oblit-
erated with firm pressure over the stethoscope.

TABLE 239-1  Effects of Physiologic Interventions on the Intensity of 
Heart Murmurs and Sounds
Respiration

Right-sided murmurs and sounds generally increase with inspiration, except for 
the PES. Left-sided murmurs and sounds are usually louder during expiration.

Valsalva Maneuver

Most murmurs decrease in length and intensity. Two exceptions are the systolic 
murmur of HOCM, which usually becomes much louder, and that of MVP, which 
becomes longer and often louder. After release of the Valsalva maneuver, 
right-sided murmurs tend to return to control intensity earlier than do left-sided 
murmurs.

After VPB or AF

Murmurs originating at normal or stenotic semilunar valves increase in the 
cardiac cycle after a VPB or in the cycle after a long cycle length in AF. By 
contrast, systolic murmurs due to AV valve regurgitation do not change or 
become shorter (MVP).

Positional Changes

With standing, most murmurs diminish, with two exceptions being the murmur 
of HOCM, which becomes louder, and that of MVP, which lengthens and often 
is intensified. With squatting, most murmurs become louder, but those of HOCM 
and MVP usually soften and may disappear. Passive leg raising usually produces 
the same results.

Exercise

Murmurs due to blood flow across normal or obstructed valves (e.g., PS, 
MS) become louder with both isotonic and submaximal isometric (hand grip) 
exercise. Murmurs of MR, VSD, and AR also increase with hand grip exercise. 
However, the murmur of HOCM often decreases with nearly maximum hand 
grip exercise. Left-sided S4 and S3 sounds are often accentuated by exercise, 
particularly when due to ischemic heart disease.

Abbreviations: AF, atrial fibrillation; AR, aortic regurgitation; HOCM, hypertrophic 
obstructive cardiomyopathy; MR, mitral regurgitation; MS, mitral stenosis; MVP, 
mitral valve prolapse; PES, pulmonic ejection sound; PR, pulmonic regurgitation; 
PS, pulmonic stenosis; TR, tricuspid regurgitation; TS, tricuspid stenosis; VPB, 
ventricular premature beat; VSD, ventricular septal defect.

Dynamic  Auscultation  Diagnostic  accuracy  can  be  enhanced 
by  the  performance  of  simple  bedside  maneuvers  to  identify  heart 
murmurs and characterize their significance (Table 239-1). Except for 
the  pulmonic  ejection  sound,  right-sided  events  increase  in  intensity 
with inspiration and decrease with expiration; left-sided events behave 
oppositely  (100%  sensitivity,  88%  specificity).  As  previously  noted, 
the intensity of the murmurs associated with MR, VSD, and AR will 
increase  in  response  to  maneuvers  that  increase  LV  afterload,  such 
as  hand  grip  and  vasopressors.  The  intensity  of  these  murmurs  will 
decrease after exposure to vasodilating agents. Squatting is associated 
with  an  abrupt  increase  in  LV  preload  and  afterload,  whereas  rapid 
standing results in a sudden decrease in preload. In patients with MVP, 
the  click  and  murmur  move  away  from  the  first  heart  sound  with 
squatting  because  of  the  delay  in  onset  of  leaflet  prolapse  at  higher 
ventricular  volumes.  With  rapid  standing,  however,  the  click  and 
murmur move closer to the first heart sound as prolapse occurs earlier 
in  systole  at  a  smaller  chamber  dimension.  The  murmur  of  HOCM 
behaves  similarly,  becoming  softer  and  shorter  with  squatting  (95% 
sensitivity,  85%  specificity)  and  longer  and  louder  on  rapid  standing 
(95% sensitivity, 84% specificity). A change in the intensity of a systolic 
murmur in the first beat after a premature beat or in the beat after a 
long cycle length in patients with atrial fibrillation suggests valvular AS 
rather than MR, particularly in an older patient in whom the murmur 
of  the  AS  may  be  well  transmitted  to  the  apex  (Gallavardin  effect). 
Of  note,  however,  the  systolic  murmur  of  HOCM  also  increases  in 
intensity in the beat after a premature beat. This increase in intensity 
of any LV outflow murmur in the beat after a premature beat relates to 
the combined effects of enhanced LV filling (from the longer diastolic 
period) and postextrasystolic potentiation of LV contractile function. 
In  either  instance,  forward  flow  will  accelerate,  causing  an  increase 
in the gradient across the LV outflow tract (dynamic or fixed) and a 
louder  systolic  murmur.  In  contrast,  the  intensity  of  the  murmur  of 
MR does not change in a postpremature beat, because there is relatively 
little change in the nearly constant LV to left atrial pressure gradient or 

further alteration in mitral valve flow. Bedside exercise can sometimes 
be performed to increase cardiac output and, secondarily, the intensity 
of  both  systolic  and  diastolic  heart  murmurs.  Most  left-sided  heart 
murmurs  decrease  in  intensity  and  duration  during  the  strain  phase 
of  the  Valsalva  maneuver.  The  murmurs  associated  with  MVP  and 
HOCM  are  the  two  notable  exceptions.  The  Valsalva  maneuver  also 
can be used to assess the integrity of the heart and vasculature in the 
setting of advanced heart failure.

Prosthetic  Heart  Valves  The  first  clue  that  prosthetic  valve 
dysfunction  may  contribute  to  recurrent  symptoms  is  frequently  a 
change in the quality of the heart sounds or the appearance of a new 
murmur. The heart sounds with a bioprosthetic valve resemble those 
generated by native valves. A mitral bioprosthesis usually is associated 
with a grade 1 to 2 midsystolic murmur along the left sternal border 
(created by turbulence across the valve struts as they project into the 
LV outflow tract) as well as by a soft mid-diastolic murmur that occurs 
with normal LV filling. This diastolic murmur often can be heard only 
in the left lateral decubitus position and after exercise. A high-pitched 
or holosystolic apical murmur is indicative of pathologic MR due to a 
paravalvular leak and/or intra-annular bioprosthetic regurgitation from 
leaflet degeneration, for which diagnostic noninvasive imaging is indi-
cated. Clinical deterioration can occur rapidly after the first expression 
of mitral bioprosthetic valve failure. A tissue valve in the aortic position 
is  always  associated  with  a  grade  1  to  3  midsystolic  murmur  at  the 
base or just below the suprasternal notch. A diastolic murmur of AR is 
abnormal in any circumstance. Mechanical valve dysfunction may first 
be suggested by a decrease in the intensity of either the opening or the 
closing sound. A high-pitched apical systolic murmur in patients with 
a  mechanical  mitral  prosthesis  and  a  diastolic  decrescendo  murmur 
in  patients  with  a  mechanical  aortic  prosthesis  indicate  paravalvular 
regurgitation.  Patients  with  prosthetic  valve  thrombosis  may  present 
clinically with signs of shock, muffled heart sounds, and soft murmurs.

Pericardial  Disease  A  pericardial  friction  rub  is  nearly  100% 
specific for the diagnosis of acute pericarditis, although the sensitivity 
of this finding is not nearly as high, because the rub may come and go 
over the course of an acute illness or be very difficult to elicit. The rub 
is heard as a leathery or scratchy three-component or two-component 
sound,  although  it  may  be  monophasic.  Classically,  the  three  com-
ponents  are  ventricular  systole,  rapid  early  diastolic  filling,  and  late 
presystolic filling after atrial contraction in patients in sinus rhythm. It 
is necessary to listen to the heart in several positions. Additional clues 
to the presence of acute pericarditis may be present from the history 
and  12-lead  electrocardiogram.  The  rub  typically  disappears  as  the 
volume  of  any  pericardial  effusion  increases.  Pericardial  tamponade 
can be diagnosed with a sensitivity of 98%, a specificity of 83%, and 
a positive likelihood ratio of 5.9 (95% confidence interval 2.4–14) by 
a  pulsus  paradoxus  that  exceeds  12  mmHg  in  a  patient  with  a  large 
pericardial effusion.

The findings on physical examination are integrated with the symp-
toms previously elicited with a careful history to construct an appro-
priate  differential  diagnosis  and  proceed  with  indicated  imaging  and 
laboratory  assessment.  The  physical  examination  is  an  irreplaceable 
component of the diagnostic algorithm and, in selected patients, can 
inform prognosis. Educational efforts to improve clinician competence 
eventually may result in cost saving, particularly if the indications for 
imaging can be influenced by the examination findings.

240 Electrocardiography

Ary L. Goldberger

QRS

An  electrocardiogram  (ECG  or  EKG)  is  a  graphical  representation 
of  electrical  activity  generated  by  the  heart.  The  signals,  detected  by 
means of metal electrodes attached to the extremities and chest wall, 
are amplified and recorded by the electrocardiograph device. ECG leads 
(derivations) are configured to display the instantaneous differences in 
potential between specific pairs of electrodes. The utility of the ECG 
derives from its immediate availability as a noninvasive, inexpensive, 
and  highly  versatile  test.  In  addition  to  its  use  in  detecting  arrhyth-
mias  and  myocardial  ischemia,  it  may  reveal  findings  related  to  life- 
threatening  metabolic  disturbances  or  to  increased  susceptibility  to 
sudden cardiac arrest (see also Chaps. 306 and 408).
 ■ ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC BACKGROUND
Depolarization of the heart is the initiating event for cardiac contrac-
tion. The electric currents that spread through the heart are produced 
by three components: cardiac pacemaker cells, specialized conduction 
tissue,  and  the  heart  muscle  itself.  The  ECG  records  only  the  depo-
larization  (stimulation)  and  repolarization  (recovery)  potentials  gen-
erated by the “working” atrial and ventricular myocardium (see also 
Chaps. 244 and 246).

The stimulus initiating the normal heartbeat originates in the sinoa-
trial (SA) node (Fig. 240-1), which possesses spontaneous automatic-
ity. Spread of the depolarization wave through the right and left atria 
induces  contraction  of  these  chambers.  Next,  the  impulse  stimulates 
specialized conduction tissues in the atrioventricular (AV) nodal and 
His-bundle areas; together, these two regions constitute the AV junc-
tion. The bundle of His branches into two main divisions, the right and 
left bundles, which rapidly transmit depolarization wavefronts in a syn-
chronous way to the right and left ventricular myocardium by way of 
the Purkinje fibers. The main left bundle fans out into left anterior and 
left posterior fascicle subdivisions. The depolarization wavefronts then 
spread through the ventricular wall, from endocardium to epicardium, 
triggering coordinated ventricular contraction. Since the cardiac depo-
larization  and  repolarization  waves  have  directions  and  magnitudes, 
they can be represented by vectors.
 ■ ECG WAVEFORMS AND INTERVALS
The  ECG  waveforms  are  labeled  alphabetically,  beginning  with  the 
P  wave,  which  represents  atrial  depolarization  (Fig.  240-2).  The 
QRS  complex  represents  ventricular  depolarization,  and  the  ST-T-U 
complex  (ST  segment,  T  wave,  and  U  wave)  represents  ventricular

repolarization. The J point is the junction between the end of the QRS 
complex  and  the  beginning  of  the  ST  segment.  Atrial  repolarization 
waveforms (ST-Ta) are usually of too low in amplitude to be detected, 
but they may become apparent in acute pericarditis, atrial infarction, 
and AV heart block.

The QRS-T waveforms of the surface ECG correspond in a general 
way  with  the  different  phases  of  simultaneously  obtained  ventricular 
action  potentials,  the  intracellular  recordings  from  single  myocardial 
fibers (Chap. 244). The rapid upstroke (phase 0) of the action potential 
corresponds to the onset of QRS. The plateau (phase 2) corresponds 
to  the  isoelectric  ST  segment,  and  active  repolarization  (phase  3) 
corresponds to the inscription of the T wave. Factors that decrease the 
slope of phase 0 by impairing the influx of Na+ (e.g., hyperkalemia and 
drugs  such  as  flecainide)  tend  to  increase  QRS  duration.  Conditions 
that prolong phase 2 or 3 (amiodarone, hypocalcemia) increase the QT 
interval.  In  contrast,  factors  (e.g.,  hypercalcemia,  digoxin)  associated 
with shortening of ventricular repolarization duration shorten the QT. 
The hereditary short QT syndrome and its relationship to sudden car-
diac arrest are discussed in Chap. 255.

The  ECG  is  usually  recorded  on  graph  paper  divided  into  1-mm2 
gridlike  boxes.  When  the  recording  speed  is  25  mm/s,  the  smallest  
(1 mm) horizontal divisions correspond to 40 ms (0.04 s), with heavier 
lines at intervals of 200 ms (0.20 s). Vertically, the ECG graph measures 
the  amplitude  of  a  specific  wave  or  deflection  (1  mV  =  10  mm  with 
standard  calibration;  the  voltage  criteria  for  hypertrophy  mentioned 
below  are  given  in  millimeters).  There  are  four  major  sets  of  ECG 
intervals: RR, PR, QRS, and QT/QTc (Fig. 240-2). The instantaneous 
heart rate (beats per minute) can be computed from the interbeat (RR) 
interval  by  dividing  the  number  of  large  (0.20  s)  time  units  between 
consecutive R waves into 300 or the number of small (40 ms) segments 
into 1500. The PR interval measures the time (normally 120–200 ms) 
between atrial and ventricular depolarization, which includes the phys-
iologic delay imposed by stimulation of cells in the AV junction area. 
The QRS interval (normally 100–110 ms or less) reflects the duration 
of ventricular depolarization. The QT interval subtends both ventric-
ular  depolarization  and  (primarily)  repolarization  times  and  varies 
inversely with the heart rate. A variety of formulas have been proposed 
for  computing  a  rate-corrected  QT,  termed  QTc,  but  without  formal 
consensus. The classic “square root” formula (QTc = QT/√RR, computed 
in second units) has been criticized for systematic errors at both lower 
and higher heart rates. One alternative is the Framingham formula (given 
here for units of milliseconds): QTc = QT + 0.154 (1000 – RR). The fol-
lowing upper normal limits (based on longest QT) have been proposed: 
QTc of 460 ms in women and 450 ms in men. Lower limits are less well 
defined. QT/QTc measurements, both visual and electronic, should be 
assessed in light of inherent limitations in their precise determination 
from standard ECGs waveforms.

representation of cardiac electrical activity.

 ■ ECG LEADS
The 12 conventional ECG leads are divided into two groups: six limb 
(extremity)  leads  and  six  chest  (precordial)  leads.  The  limb  leads 
record  potentials  transmitted  onto  the  frontal  plane  (Fig.  240-3A); 
the chest leads record potentials transmitted onto the horizontal plane  
(Fig. 240-3B).

The  orientation  and  polarity  of  the  frontal  plane  leads  are  repre-
sented  on  a  hexaxial  diagram  (Fig.  240-4).  The  six  chest  leads  are 
obtained by exploring electrodes as shown in Fig. 240-5.

Each lead is analogous to a different video camera angle “looking” at the 
same  events—atrial  and  ventricular  depolarization  and  repolarization—
from  different  spatial  orientations.  The  12-lead  ECG  can  be  supple-
mented  with  additional  leads  in  special  circumstances.  For  example, 
right precordial leads V3R to V6R are useful in detecting evidence of 
acute  right  ventricular  ischemia.  Bedside  monitors  and  ambulatory 
ECGs (e.g., Holter monitors, event recorders, patch electrode and other 
medical  wearable  devices)  usually  employ  only  one  or  two  modified 
leads.  The  standard  ECG  leads  are  configured  such  that  a  positive 
(upright)  deflection  is  recorded  in  a  lead  if  a  wave  of  depolarization 
spreads toward the positive pole of that lead, and a negative deflection 
is recorded if the wave spreads toward the negative pole. If the mean 
orientation of the depolarization vector is at right angles to a particular

GENESIS OF THE NORMAL ECG
 ■ P WAVE
The  normal  atrial  depolarization  vector  is  oriented 
downward  and  toward  the  subject’s  left,  reflecting  the 
spread of depolarization from the sinus node to the right 
and  then  the  left  atrial  myocardium.  Since  this  vector 
points toward the positive pole of lead II and toward the 
negative  pole  of  lead  aVR,  the  sinus-generated  P  wave 
will be positive in lead II and negative in aVR. By con-
trast, activation of the atria from an ectopic pacemaker 
in the lower part of either atrium or in the AV junction 
region may produce retrograde P waves (negative in II, 
positive in aVR). The normal P wave in lead V1 may be 
biphasic with a positive component reflecting right atrial 
depolarization,  followed  by  a  small  (<1  mm2)  negative  component 
reflecting left atrial depolarization.
 ■ QRS COMPLEX
Normal  ventricular  depolarization  proceeds  as  a  rapid,  continuous 
spread of activation wave fronts. This complex process can be divided 
into two major sequential phases, and each phase can be represented 
by  a  mean  vector  (Fig.  240-6).  The  first  phase  is  depolarization  of 
the  interventricular  septum  from  the  left  to  the  right  and  anteriorly 
(vector 1). The second results from the simultaneous depolarization of  
the  right  and  left  ventricles;  it  normally  is  dominated  by  the  more 
massive  left  ventricle,  so  that  vector  2  points  leftward  and  posteri-
orly.  Therefore,  a  right  precordial  lead  (V1)  will  record  this  biphasic 
depolarization process with a small positive deflection (septal r wave) 
followed by a larger negative deflection (S wave). A left precordial lead, 
for example, V6, will record the same sequence with a small negative 
deflection (septal q wave) followed by a relatively tall positive deflec-
tion  (R  wave).  Intermediate  leads  show  a  relative  increase  in  R-wave 
amplitude  (normal  R-wave  progression)  and  a  decrease  in  S-wave 
amplitude  progressing  across  the  chest  from  right  to  left.  The  lead 
where the R and S waves are of about equal amplitude is referred to as 
the transition zone (usually V3 or V4) (Fig. 240-7).

The  QRS  pattern  in  the  extremity  leads  may  vary  considerably 
from  one  normal  subject  to  another  depending  on  the  electrical  axis 
of the QRS, which describes the mean orientation of the QRS vector 
with  reference  to  the  six  frontal  plane  leads.  Normally,  the  QRS  axis

FIGURE  240-5  The horizontal plane (chest or precordial) leads are obtained with 
electrodes in the locations shown. Additional posterior leads are sometimes placed 
on  the  same  horizontal  plane  as  V4  to  facilitate  detection  of  acute  posterolateral 
infarction (V7, midaxillary line; V8, posterior axillary line; and V9, posterior scapular 
line).  Right  chest  leads  (V3R–V6R)  may  enhance  detection  of  right  ventricular 
involvement in the context of inferior infarction.

FIGURE  240-6  Ventricular  depolarization  can  be  divided  into  two  major  phases, 
each represented by a vector. A. The first phase (arrow 1) denotes depolarization 
of the ventricular septum, beginning on the left side and spreading to the right. This 
process is represented by a small “septal” r wave in lead V1 and a small septal q 
wave in lead V6. B. Simultaneous depolarization of the left and right ventricles (LV 
and RV) constitutes the second phase. Vector 2 is oriented to the left and posteriorly, 
reflecting the electrical predominance of the LV. C. Vectors (arrows) representing

ranges  from  −30°  to  +100°  (Fig.  240-4).  An  axis  more  negative  than 
–30° is referred to as left axis deviation, and an axis more positive than 
+90 to +100° is referred to as right axis deviation. Left axis deviation 
may occur as a normal variant but is more commonly associated with 
left ventricular hypertrophy, a block in the anterior fascicle of the left

bundle system (left anterior fascicular block or hemiblock), or inferior 
myocardial infarction. Right axis deviation also may occur as a normal 
variant (particularly in children and young adults), as a spurious find-
ing due to reversal of the left and right arm electrodes, or in conditions 
such as right ventricular overload (acute or chronic), lateral infarction, 
dextrocardia, left pneumothorax, and left posterior fascicular block.

 ■ T WAVE AND U WAVE
Normally, the mean T-wave vector is oriented roughly concordant with 
the  mean  QRS  vector  (within  about  45°  in  the  frontal  plane).  Since 
depolarization and repolarization are electrically opposite processes, this 
normal  QRS–T-wave  vector  concordance  indicates  that  repolarization 
normally must proceed in the reverse direction from depolarization (i.e., 
from ventricular epicardium to endocardium). The normal U wave is a 
small, rounded deflection (≤1 mm) that follows the T wave and usually 
has the same polarity as the T wave. An abnormal increase in U-wave 
amplitude is most commonly due to drugs (e.g., dofetilide, amiodarone, 
sotalol,  quinidine)  or  to  hypokalemia.  Very  prominent  U  waves  are  a 
marker of increased susceptibility to torsades de pointes (Chap. 246).

MAJOR ECG ABNORMALITIES
 ■ CARDIAC ENLARGEMENT AND HYPERTROPHY
Right  atrial  overload  (acute  or  chronic)  may  lead  to  an  increase  in 
P-wave  amplitude  (≥2.5  mm)  (Fig.  240-8),  previously  referred  to  as 
“P-pulmonale.” Left atrial overload typically produces a biphasic P wave 
in  V1  with  a  broad  negative  component  or  a  broad  (≥120  ms),  often 
notched P wave in one or more limb leads (Fig. 240-8). This pattern, 
historically  referred  to  as  “P-mitrale,”  may  also  occur  with  left  atrial 
conduction delays in the absence of actual atrial enlargement, leading 
to the more general designation of left atrial abnormality.

Right  ventricular  hypertrophy  due  to  a  sustained,  severe  pressure 
load (e.g., due to tight pulmonic valve stenosis or certain pulmonary 
artery  hypertension  syndromes)  is  characterized  by  a  relatively  tall  
R  wave  in  lead  V1  (R  ≥  S  wave),  usually  with  right  axis  deviation  
(Fig. 240-9); alternatively, there may be a qR pattern in V1 or V3R. ST 
depression and T-wave inversion in the right to mid-precordial leads 
are  also  often  present.  This  pattern,  formerly  called  right  ventricular 
“strain,”  is  attributed  to  repolarization  abnormalities  in  acutely  or 
chronically overloaded muscle. Prominent S waves may occur in the left 
lateral  precordial  leads.  Right  ventricular  hypertrophy  due  to  ostium 
secundum  atrial  septal  defects,  with  the  accompanying  right  ventric-
ular volume overload, is commonly associated with an incomplete or 
complete right bundle branch block pattern with a rightward QRS axis.
Acute  cor  pulmonale  due  to  pulmonary  thromboembolism  (Chap. 
279),  for  example,  may  be  associated  with  a  normal  ECG  or  a 
variety  of  abnormalities.  Sinus  tachy-
cardia  is  the  most  common  arrhyth-
mia,  although  other  tachyarrhythmias, 
such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, may 
occur.  The  QRS  axis  may  shift  to  the 
right, sometimes in concert with the so-
called S1Q3T3 pattern (prominence of the  
S wave in lead I and the Q wave in lead 
III,  with  T-wave  inversion  in  lead  III). 
Acute right ventricular dilation also may 
be associated with slow R-wave progres-
sion and ST-T abnormalities in V1 to V4 
simulating  acute  anterior  infarction.  A 
right ventricular conduction disturbance 
may appear.

zone (R wave ≈ S wave) in lead V3.

tive  lung  disease  (Chap.  296)  usually 
does  not  produce  the  classic  ECG  pat-
terns  of  right  ventricular  hypertrophy 
noted  above.  Instead  of  tall  right  pre-
cordial  R  waves,  chronic  obstructive 
lung  disease  (emphysema)  more  typi-
cally is associated with small R waves in

right to mid-precordial leads (slow R-wave progression) due in part to 
downward displacement of the diaphragm and the heart. Low-voltage 
complexes are commonly present, owing to hyperaeration.

Multiple voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (Fig. 240-9) 
have been proposed on the basis of the presence of tall left precordial 
R waves and deep right precordial S waves (e.g., SV1 + [RV5 or RV6] 
>35  mm).  Repolarization  abnormalities  (ST  depression  with  T-wave 
inversions,  formerly  called  the  left  ventricular  “strain”  pattern)  also

may  appear  in  leads  with  prominent  R  waves.  However,  prominent 
precordial voltages may occur as a normal variant, especially in athletic 
or young individuals. Left ventricular hypertrophy may increase limb 
lead voltage with or without increased precordial voltage (e.g., RaVL + 
SV3 >20 mm in women and >28 mm in men). The presence of left atrial 
abnormality  increases  the  likelihood  of  underlying  left  ventricular 
hypertrophy in cases with borderline voltage criteria. Left ventricular 
hypertrophy  often  progresses  to  incomplete  or  complete  left  bundle 
branch block. The sensitivities of conventional voltage criteria for left 
ventricular hypertrophy are low in middle-age to older adults and may 
be  decreased  further  in  obese  persons  and  smokers,  as  well  as  with 
right bundle branch block. ECG evidence for left ventricular hypertro-
phy is a major noninvasive marker of increased risk of cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality rates, including sudden cardiac death. How-
ever,  because  of  false-positive  and  false-negative  diagnoses,  the  ECG 
is  of  limited  utility  in  diagnosing  atrial  or  ventricular  enlargement. 
More definitive anatomic and functional information may be provided 
at  increased  cost  by  echocardiographic  and  other  imaging  studies  
(Chaps. 241 and A9).
 ■ BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCKS AND RELATED PATTERNS
Intrinsic impairment of conduction in either the right or the left bun-
dle system (intraventricular conduction disturbances) leads to prolon-
gation of the QRS interval. With complete bundle branch blocks, the 
widest QRS interval is ≥120 ms in duration; with incomplete blocks, 
the  QRS  interval  is  between  about  110  and  120  ms.  The  QRS  vector 
usually  is  oriented  in  the  direction  of  the  myocardial  region  where 
depolarization is delayed (Fig. 240-10). Thus, with right bundle branch 
block, the terminal QRS vector is oriented to the right and anteriorly 
(rSR′ in V1 and qRS in V6, typically). Left bundle branch block alters 
both  early  and  later  phases  of  ventricular  depolarization.  The  major 
QRS  vector  is  directed  to  the  left  and  posteriorly.  In  addition,  the 
normal early left-to-right pattern of septal activation is disrupted such 
that septal depolarization proceeds from right to left as well. As a result, 
left bundle branch block generates wide, predominantly negative (QS) 
complexes in lead V1 and entirely positive (R) complexes in V6. Wave-
form patterns identical to those of left bundle branch block, preceded 
by  a  sharp  (but  sometimes  low  amplitude)  spike,  are  seen  in  most 
cases of electronic right ventricular pacing due to the relative delay in 
left  ventricular  activation.  In  contrast,  biventricular  pacing  (cardiac

FIGURE  240-9  Left  ventricular  hypertrophy  (LVH)  increases  the  amplitude  of 
electrical  forces  directed  to  the  left  and  posteriorly.  In  addition,  repolarization 
abnormalities  may  cause  ST-segment  depression  and  T-wave  inversion  in  leads 
with  a  prominent  R  wave.  Right  ventricular  hypertrophy  (RVH)  may  shift  the  QRS 
vector to the right; this effect usually is associated with an R, RS, or qR complex in 
lead V1. T-wave inversions may be present in right precordial leads.

1828 resynchronization  therapy)  usually  produces  a  right  bundle  branch 

morphology along with a wide R wave in lead aVR.

Bundle branch block may occur in a variety of conditions. In sub-
jects without structural heart disease, right bundle branch block is seen 
more commonly than left bundle branch block. Right bundle branch 
block also occurs with heart disease, both congenital (e.g., atrial sep-
tal defect) and acquired (e.g., valvular, ischemic). Left bundle branch 
block is often a marker of one of four underlying conditions associated 
with  increased  risk  of  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  rates: 
coronary heart disease (frequently with impaired left ventricular func-
tion), hypertensive heart disease, aortic valve disease (including after 
transcatheter  aortic  valve  replacement),  and  cardiomyopathy.  Bundle 
branch blocks may be chronic or intermittent. A bundle branch block 
may be rate-related, not uncommonly occurring when the heart rate 
exceeds some critical value.

Bundle branch blocks and depolarization abnormalities secondary 
to  artificial  pacemakers  not  only  affect  ventricular  depolarization 
(QRS)  but  also  are  characteristically  associated  with  secondary  repo-
larization  (ST-T)  abnormalities.  With  bundle  branch  blocks,  the  
T wave is typically opposite in polarity to the last deflection of the QRS 
(Fig. 240-10). This discordance of the QRS–T-wave vectors is caused 
by the altered sequence of repolarization that occurs as a consequence 
of  altered  depolarization.  In  contrast,  primary  repolarization  abnor-
malities  are  independent  of  QRS  changes  and  are  related  instead  to 
actual alterations in the electrical properties of the myocardial fibers 
themselves (e.g., in the resting membrane potential or action potential 
duration), not just to changes in the sequence of repolarization. Ische-
mia, electrolyte imbalance, and drugs such as digitalis all cause such 
primary ST–T-wave changes. Primary and secondary T-wave changes 
may  coexist.  For  example,  T-wave  inversions  in  the  right  precordial 
leads with left bundle branch block or in the left precordial leads with 
right  bundle  branch  block  may  be  important  markers  of  underlying 
ischemia or other abnormalities. A distinctive abnormality simulating 
right  bundle  branch  block  with  ST-segment  elevations  in  the  right 
chest leads is seen with the Brugada pattern (Chap. 255).

Partial blocks in the left bundle system (left anterior or posterior fas-
cicular blocks or hemiblocks) generally do not prolong the QRS dura-
tion substantially but instead are associated with shifts in the frontal 
plane QRS axis (leftward or rightward, respectively). Left anterior fas-
cicular block (QRS axis more negative than –45°) is probably the most 
common cause of marked left axis deviation in adults. In contrast, left 
posterior fascicular block (QRS axis more rightward than +110–120°) 
is extremely rare as an isolated finding and requires exclusion of other 
factors causing right axis deviation mentioned earlier. Intraventricular 
conduction  delays  also  can  be  caused  by  factors  extrinsic  (toxic)  to 
the  conduction  system  that  slow  ventricular  conduction,  particularly 
hyperkalemia  or  drugs  (e.g.,  class  1  antiarrhythmic  agents,  tricyclic 
antidepressants, phenothiazines). Prolongation of QRS duration does 
not necessarily indicate a conduction delay but may be due to preexci-
tation of the ventricles via a bypass tract, as in Wolff-Parkinson-White 
(WPW) patterns (Chap. 249) and related variants.

 ■ MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA AND INFARCTION
(See also Chap. 275) The ECG is central to the diagnosis of acute and 
chronic ischemic heart disease. Ischemia exerts complex time-dependent 
effects  on  the  electrical  properties  of  myocardial  cells.  Severe,  acute 
ischemia  lowers  the  resting  membrane  potential  and  shortens  the 

duration of the action potential. Such changes cause a voltage gradient 
between normal and ischemic zones. As a consequence, current flows 
between those regions. These currents of injury are represented on the 
surface ECG by deviation of the ST segment (Fig. 240-11). When the 
acute ischemia is transmural, the ST vector usually is shifted in the direc-
tion of the outer (epicardial) layers, producing ST elevations and some-
times, in the earliest stages of ischemia, tall, positive so-called hyperacute 
T waves over the ischemic zone. With ischemia confined primarily to the 
subendocardium, the ST vector typically shifts toward the subendocar-
dium and ventricular cavity, so that overlying (e.g., anterior precordial) 
leads  show  ST-segment  depression  (with  ST  elevation  in  lead  aVR). 
Multiple factors affect the amplitude of acute ischemic ST deviations. 
Profound ST elevation or depression in multiple leads usually indicates 
very severe ischemia. From a clinical viewpoint, the division of acute 
myocardial infarction into ST-segment elevation and non-ST elevation 
types is useful since the consistent efficacy of emergency (minutes to 
hours) reperfusion therapy is limited to the former group; the evolving 
indications  for  acute  reperfusion  therapy  in  non-ST  elevation  myo-
cardial  infarction  are  a  focus  of  intensive  investigation  (Chap.  274). 
Takotsubo  syndrome  may  closely  simulate  the  patterns  of  acute  or 
evolving ST-segment elevation or non-ST-segment elevation myocar-
dial infarction (Chap. 273).

The ECG leads are usually more helpful in localizing regions of ST 
elevation  than  non-ST  elevation  ischemia.  For  example,  acute  trans-
mural anterior (including apical and lateral) wall ischemia is reflected 
by ST elevations or increased T-wave positivity in one or more of the 
precordial leads (V1–V6) and leads I and aVL. Inferior wall ischemia 
produces  changes  in  leads  II,  III,  and  aVF.  “Posterior”  wall  ischemia 
(almost  always  associated  with  lateral  or  inferior  involvement)  may 
be  indirectly  recognized  by  reciprocal  ST  depressions  in  leads  V1  to 
V3  (thus  constituting  an  ST  elevation  “equivalent”  acute  coronary 
syndrome).  Acute  right  ventricular  ischemia  usually  produces  ST 
elevations  in  right-sided  chest  leads  (Fig.  240-5).  When  ischemic  ST 
elevations occur as the earliest sign of acute infarction, they typically 
are  followed  within  a  period  ranging  from  hours  to  days  by  evolv-
ing  T-wave  inversions  and  often  by  Q  waves  occurring  in  the  same 
lead  distribution.  Reversible  transmural  ischemia,  for  example,  due 
to  coronary  vasospasm  (Prinzmetal’s  angina)  may  cause  transient 
ST-segment  elevations  without  development  of  Q  waves.  Depending 
on the severity and duration of ischemia, the ST elevations may resolve 
completely in minutes or be followed by T-wave inversions that persist 
for hours or even days. Patients with ischemic chest pain who present 
with deep T-wave inversions in multiple precordial leads (e.g., V1–V4, 
I, and aVL) with or without cardiac enzyme elevations typically have 
severe  obstruction  in  the  left  anterior  descending  coronary  artery  
(Fig. 240-12).

With  infarction,  depolarization  (QRS)  changes  often  accompany 
repolarization (ST-T) abnormalities. Necrosis of sufficient myocardial 
tissue may lead to decreased R-wave amplitude or abnormal Q waves 
(even in the absence of transmural ischemia) in the anterior or inferior 
leads (Fig. 240-13). Abnormal Q waves were once considered markers 
of  transmural  myocardial  infarction,  whereas  subendocardial  infarcts 
were  thought  not  to  produce  Q  waves.  However,  correlative  studies 
have indicated that transmural infarcts may occur without Q waves and 
that subendocardial (nontransmural) infarcts sometimes may be asso-
ciated with Q waves. Therefore, evolving or chronic infarcts are more 
appropriately  classified  as  “Q-wave”  or  “non-Q-wave”  (Chap.  A7).

epicardial injury), the ST vector will be directed outward. Overlying leads will record ST elevation.

FIGURE 240-12  Severe anterior wall ischemia (with or without infarction) may cause prominent T-wave inversions in the precordial leads and in leads I and aVL. This 
pattern (sometimes referred to as Wellens T waves) is usually associated with a high-grade stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery.

Loss of depolarization forces due to posterior or lateral infarction may 
cause reciprocal increases in R-wave amplitude in leads V1 and V2 with-
out diagnostic Q waves in any of the conventional leads. (Additional 
leads V7–V9 may show acute changes.) In the weeks and months after 
infarction, these ECG changes may persist or begin to resolve. Com-
plete normalization of the ECG after Q-wave infarction is uncommon 
but may occur, particularly with smaller infarcts. In contrast, ST-seg-
ment elevations that persist for several weeks or more after a Q-wave 
infarct usually correlate with a severe underlying wall motion disorder, 
although not necessarily a frank ventricular aneurysm.

The  ECG  has  important  limitations  in  both  sensitivity  and  spec-
ificity  in  the  diagnosis  of  acute  and  chronic  ischemic  heart  disease. 
Although  a  single  normal  ECG  does  not  exclude  ischemia  or  even 
acute  infarction,  a  normal  ECG  throughout  the  course  of  an  acute 
infarct is distinctly uncommon. Prolonged chest pain without diagnos-
tic ECG changes therefore should always prompt a careful search for 
other noncoronary causes of chest pain (Chap. 14). Furthermore, the 
diagnostic changes of acute or evolving ischemia are often masked by 
the presence of left bundle branch block, electronic ventricular pace-
maker  patterns,  and  Wolff-Parkinson-White  preexcitation.  However, 
clinicians may also overdiagnose ischemia or infarction based on the 
presence of ST-segment elevations or depressions; T-wave inversions; 
tall, positive T waves; or Q waves not related to ischemic heart disease 
(pseudoinfarct  patterns).  For  example,  ST-segment  elevations  sim-
ulating  acute  ischemia/infarction  may  occur  with  acute  pericarditis 
or  myocarditis,  including  COVID-19  infections,  as  a  normal  variant 
(including the typical “early repolarization” pattern), or in a variety of 
other conditions (Table 240-1). Similarly, tall T waves do not invari-
ably  represent  hyperacute  ischemic  changes  but  may  also  be  caused 

by  normal  variants,  hyperkalemia,  or  cerebrovascular  injury,  among 
other causes.

ST-segment elevations and tall, positive T waves are common find-
ings in leads V1 and V2 in left bundle branch block or left ventricular 
hypertrophy in the absence of ischemia. The differential diagnosis of 
Q waves includes physiologic or positional variants, ventricular hyper-
trophy, acute or chronic noncoronary myocardial injury, hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy,  and  ventricular  conduction  disorders.  Ventricular 
hypertrophy, hypokalemia, drugs such as digoxin, and a variety of other 
factors  may  cause  ST-segment  depression  mimicking  subendocardial 
ischemia.  Prominent  T-wave  inversion  may  occur  with  ventricular 
hypertrophy,  cardiomyopathies,  myocarditis,  and  “stress  cardiomy-
opathies”  associated  with  takotsubo  syndrome  and  cerebrovascular 
injury  (particularly  intracranial  bleeds),  among  others  causes.  Diag-
nostic confusion may also occur when nonischemic T-wave inversions  
(“cardiac  memory”  effect)  appear  in  normally  conducted  beats  in 
patients with intermittent wide QRS complexes, most commonly due 
to ventricular pacing or to left bundle branch block.

 ■ METABOLIC FACTORS AND DRUG EFFECTS
A  variety  of  metabolic  abnormalities  and  pharmacologic  agents  alter 
the ECG and, in particular, cause changes in repolarization (ST-T-U) 
and sometimes QRS prolongation. Certain life-threatening electrolyte 
disturbances may be diagnosed initially and monitored from the ECG. 
Hyperkalemia  produces  a  sequence  of  changes  (Fig.  240-14),  usually 
beginning  with  narrowing  and  peaking  (tenting)  of  the  T  waves. 
Further  elevation  of  extracellular  K+  leads  to  AV  conduction  distur-
bances,  diminution  in  P-wave  amplitude,  and  widening  of  the  QRS 
interval.  Severe  hyperkalemia  eventually  causes  cardiac  arrest  with  a

slow sinusoidal type of mechanism (“sine-wave” pattern) followed by 
asystole.  Hypokalemia  (Fig.  240-15)  prolongs  ventricular  repolariza-
tion, often with prominent U waves. Prolongation of the QT interval 
is  also  seen  with  drugs  that  increase  the  duration  of  the  ventricular 
action  potential:  class  1A  antiarrhythmic  agents  and  related  drugs 
(e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, tricyclic antidepressants, 
phenothiazines)  and  class  III  agents  (e.g.,  amiodarone  [Fig.  240-15], 
dofetilide, sotalol, ibutilide). Systemic hypothermia (Fig. 240-15) also 
prolongs repolarization, usually with a distinctive convex elevation of 
the J point (Osborn wave). Marked QT prolongation, sometimes with 
deep,  wide  T-wave  inversions,  may  occur  with  intracranial  bleeds, 
particularly  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  (“CVA  T-wave”  pattern)  (Fig. 
240-15). Hypocalcemia typically prolongs the QT interval (ST portion), 
whereas  hypercalcemia  shortens  it  (Fig.  240-16).  Digitalis  glycosides 

also shorten the QT interval, often with a characteristic “scooping” of 
the ST–T-wave complex (digitalis effect).
 ■ NONSPECIFIC ST-T CHANGES AND LOW QRS 
VOLTAGE
Many  other  factors  are  associated  with  ECG  changes,  particularly 
alterations  in  ventricular  repolarization.  T-wave  flattening,  minimal 
T-wave  inversions,  or  slight  ST-segment  depression  (“nonspecific 
ST–T-wave changes”) may occur with a variety of electrolyte and acid-
base  disturbances,  infectious  or  inflammatory  processes,  central  ner-
vous system disorders, endocrine abnormalities, many drugs, ischemia, 
hypoxia,  and  virtually  any  type  of  cardiopulmonary  abnormality,  in 
addition to physiologic changes (e.g., with posture or with meals). Low 
QRS voltage is arbitrarily defined as peak-to-trough QRS amplitudes of 
≤5 mm in the six limb leads and/or ≤10 mm in the chest leads. Multiple 
factors may be responsible. Among the most serious include pericar-
dial (Fig. 240-17) or pleural effusions, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, and anasarca.
 ■ ELECTRICAL ALTERNANS SYNDROMES
Electrical  alternans—a  beat-to-beat  alternation  in  one  or  more  com-
ponents  of  the  ECG  signal—is  a  common  type  of  nonlinear  cardio-
vascular response to a variety of hemodynamic and electrophysiologic 
perturbations.  Total  electrical  alternans  (P-QRS-T)  with  sinus  tachy-
cardia is a relatively specific sign of pericardial effusion, usually with 
cardiac  tamponade  (Fig.  240-17).  In  contrast,  pure  repolarization 
(ST-T or U wave) alternans is a sign of electrical instability and may 
precede ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
 ■ CLINICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE ECG
Accurate  analysis  of  ECGs  requires  thoroughness  and  care.  The 
patient’s  age,  gender,  and  clinical  status  should  always  be  taken  into 
account.  Many  mistakes  in  ECG  interpretation  are  errors  of  omis-
sion.  Therefore,  a  systematic  approach  is  essential.  The  following  14 
points should be analyzed carefully in every ECG: (1) standardization 
(calibration)  and  technical  features  (including  lead  placement  and 
artifacts),  (2)  rhythm,  (3)  heart  rate,  (4)  PR  interval/AV  conduction, 
(5) QRS interval, (6) QT/QTc intervals, (7) mean QRS electrical axis, 
(8) P waves, (9) QRS voltages, (10) precordial R-wave progression, (11) 
abnormal Q waves, (12) ST segments, (13) T waves, and (14) U waves. 
Comparison with any previous ECGs is invaluable.
 ■ COMPUTERIZED ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY
Computerized  systems  are  widely  used  for  immediate  retrieval  of 
thousands of ECG records. Fully automated computerized ECG anal-
yses still have major limitations and, therefore, should not be accepted 
without careful clinician review of both waveforms and intervals.

Prominent repolarization prolongation, particularly if due to hypokalemia, inherited “channelopathies,” or certain pharmacologic agents, indicates increased susceptibility 
to torsades des pointes ventricular tachycardia (Chap. 254). Marked systemic hypothermia is associated with a distinctive convex “hump” at the J point (Osborn wave,

The  ability  to  image  the  heart  and  blood  vessels  noninvasively  has 
been  one  of  the  greatest  advances  in  cardiovascular  medicine  since 
the  development  of  the  electrocardiogram  (ECG).  Cardiac  imaging 
complements history taking and physical examination, blood and lab-
oratory testing, and exercise testing in the diagnosis and management 
of most diseases of the cardiovascular system. Modern cardiovascular 
imaging  consists  of  echocardiography  (cardiac  ultrasound),  nuclear 
scintigraphy including positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT). 
These studies, often used in conjunction with exercise or pharmaco-
logic stress testing, can be used independently or in concert depending 
on the specific diagnostic needs. In this chapter, we review the princi-
ples of each of these modalities and the utility and relative benefits of 
each for the most common cardiovascular diseases.

PRINCIPLES OF MULTIMODALITY 
CARDIAC IMAGING
 ■ ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
Echocardiography  uses  high-frequency  sound  waves  (ultrasound)  to 
penetrate  the  body,  reflect  from  relevant  structures,  and  generate  an 
image. The basic physical principles of echocardiography are identical 

to other types of ultrasound imaging, although the hardware and soft-
ware  are  optimized  for  evaluation  of  cardiac  structure  and  function. 
Early  echocardiography  machines  displayed  “M-mode”  echocardio-
grams  in  which  a  single  ultrasound  beam  was  displayed  over  time 
on  a  moving  sheet  of  paper  (Fig.  241-1,  left  panel).  Modern  echoc-
ardiographic  machinery  uses  phased  array  transducers  that  contain 
up  to  512  elements  and  emit  ultrasound  in  sequence.  The  reflected 
ultrasound is then sensed by the receiving elements. A “scan conver-
ter” uses information about the timing and magnitude of the reflected 
ultrasound  to  generate  an  image  (Fig.  241-1,  right  panel).  This 
sequence happens repeatedly in “real time” to generate moving images 
with frame rates that are typically greater than 30 frames per second, 
but can exceed 100 frames per second. The gray scale of the image fea-
tures indicates the intensity of the reflected ultrasound; fluid or blood 
appears black, and highly reflective structures, such as calcifications on 
cardiac valves or the pericardium, appear white. Tissues such as myo-
cardium appear more gray, and tissues such as muscle display a unique 
speckle pattern. Although M-mode echocardiography has largely been 
supplanted by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography, it is still used 
because of its high temporal resolution and accuracy for making linear 
measurements.

The  spatial  resolution  of  ultrasound  is  dependent  on  the  wave-
length: the smaller the wavelength and the higher the frequency of the 
ultrasound  beam,  the  greater  are  the  spatial  resolution  and  ability  to 
discern  small  structures.  Increasing  the  frequency  of  ultrasound  will 
increase resolution but at the expense of reduced penetration. Higher 
frequencies can be used in pediatric imaging or transesophageal echoc-
ardiography where the transducer can be much closer to the structures 
being  interrogated,  and  this  is  a  rationale  for  using  transesophageal 
echocardiography to obtain higher quality images.

Three-dimensional  ultrasound  transducers  use  a  waffle-like  matrix 
array transducer and receive a pyramidal data sector. Three-dimensional 
echocardiography is being increasingly used for assessment of congeni-
tal heart disease and valves, although current image quality lags behind 
2D ultrasound (Fig. 241-2).

In addition to the generation of 2D images that provide information 
about cardiac structure and function, echocardiography can be used to 
interrogate blood flow within the heart and blood vessels by using the 
Doppler principle to ascertain the velocity of blood flow. When ultra-
sound  emitted  from  a  transducer  reflects  off  red  blood  cells  that  are 
moving toward the transducer, the reflected ultrasound will return at a 
slightly higher frequency than emitted; the opposite is true when flow 
moves  away  from  the  transducer.  That  frequency  difference,  termed 
the  Doppler  shift,  is  directly  related  to  the  velocity  of  the  flow  of  the 
red blood cells. The velocity of blood flow between two chambers will 
be directly related to the pressure gradient between those chambers. A 
modified form of the Bernoulli equation,

p = 4v2
where p = the pressure gradient and v = the velocity of blood flow in 
meters per second, can be used to calculate this pressure gradient in 
the  majority  of  clinical  circumstances.  This  principle  can  be  used  to 
determine the pressure gradient between chambers and across valves 
and has become central to the quantitative assessment of valvular heart 
disease.

There are three types of Doppler ultrasound that are typically used 
in standard echocardiographic examinations: spectral Doppler, which 
consists of both pulsed wave Doppler and continuous wave Doppler, 
and  color  flow  Doppler.  Both  types  of  spectral  Doppler  will  display 
a waveform representing the velocity of blood flow, with time on the 
horizontal axis and velocity on the vertical axis. Pulsed wave Doppler 
is used to interrogate relatively low velocity flow and has the ability to 
determine  blood  flow  velocity  at  a  particular  location  within  the  heart. 
Continuous  wave  Doppler  is  used  to  assess  high-velocity  flow,  but  it 
can only identify the highest velocity in a particular direction and can-
not interrogate the velocity at a specific depth location. Both of these 
techniques can only accurately assess velocities that are in the direction 
of the ultrasound scan lines, and velocities that are at an angle to the 
direction of the ultrasound beam will be underestimated. Color flow

Doppler  is  a  form  of  pulsed  wave  Doppler  in  which  the  velocity  of 
blood flow is color encoded according to a scale and superimposed on 
a 2D grayscale image in real time, giving the appearance of real-time 
flow within the heart. The Doppler principle can also be used to assess 
the  velocity  of  myocardial  motion,  which  is  a  sensitive  way  to  assess 
myocardial function (Fig. 241-3). A standard full transthoracic echoc-
ardiographic examination consists of a series of 2D views made up of 
different imaging planes from various scanning locations and spectral 
and color flow Doppler assessment.

Transesophageal  echocardiography  is  a  form  of  echocardiography 
in  which  the  transducer  is  located  on  the  tip  of  an  endoscope  that 
can be inserted into the esophagus. This procedure allows closer, less 
obstructed  views  of  cardiac  structures,  without  having  to  penetrate 
through chest wall, muscle, and ribs. Because less penetration is needed, 
a higher frequency probe can be used, and image quality and spatial 
resolution are generally higher than with standard transthoracic imag-
ing, particularly for structures that are more posterior. Transesophageal 
echocardiography has become the test of choice for assessment of small 
lesions in the heart such as valvular vegetations, especially in the set-
ting of a prosthetic valve disease, and intracardiac thrombi, including 
assessment of the left atrial appendage, which is difficult to visualize 
with standard transthoracic imaging, and for assessment of congenital

commonly, by 2D echocardiography. Global longitudinal 
strain is assessed from the apical view and calculated as 
the  endocardial  perimeter  length  in  end  diastole  minus 
the  endocardial  perimeter  length  in  end  systole  divided 
by  the  endocardial  perimeter  length  in  end  diastole.  It 
is more robust as a measure of contractile function than 
volumetric-based  ejection  fraction  and  has  been  shown 
to  be  predictive  of  outcome  in  a  variety  of  cardiac  dis-
eases,  including  heart  failure  and  following  myocardial 
infarction.
 ■ RADIONUCLIDE IMAGING
Radionuclide  imaging  techniques  are  commonly  used 
for  the  evaluation  of  patients  with  known  or  suspected 
coronary  artery  disease  (CAD),  including  for  initial 
diagnosis and risk stratification as well as the assessment 
of  myocardial  viability.  In  addition,  radionuclide  imag-
ing is commonly used in the evaluation of patients with 
suspected  cardiac  amyloidosis,  myocardial  and  vascular 
inflammation,  and  infective  endocarditis.  These  tech-
niques  use  small  amounts  of  radiopharmaceuticals  (Table  241-1), 
which  are  injected  intravenously  and  trapped  in  the  heart  and/or 
vascular  cells.  Radioactivity  within  the  heart  and  vasculature  decays 
by  emitting  gamma  rays.  The  interaction  between  these  gamma  rays 
and  the  detectors  in  specialized  scanners  (single-photon  emission 
computed tomography [SPECT] and PET) creates a scintillation event 
or light output, which can be captured by digital recording equipment 
to form an image of the heart and vasculature. Like CT and MRI, radi-
onuclide images also generate tomographic (three-dimensional) views 
of the heart and vasculature.

Radiopharmaceuticals Used in Clinical Imaging  Table 241-1 
summarizes the most commonly used radiopharmaceuticals in clinical 
SPECT and PET imaging.

Protocols  for  Stress  Myocardial  Perfusion  Imaging  Both 
exercise and pharmacologic stress can be used for myocardial perfu-
sion imaging. Exercise stress is generally preferred because it is phys-
iologic and provides additional clinically important information (i.e., 
clinical  and  hemodynamic  responses,  ST-segment  changes,  exercise 
duration,  and  functional  status).  However,  submaximal  effort  will 
lower  the  sensitivity  of  the  test  and  should  be  avoided,  especially  if 
the test is requested for initial diagnosis of CAD. In patients who are 
unable to exercise or who exercise submaximally, pharmacologic stress 
offers an adequate alternative to exercise stress testing. Pharmacologic 
stress  can  be  accomplished  either  with  coronary  vasodilators,  such 
as  adenosine,  dipyridamole,  or  regadenoson,  or  β1-receptor  agonists, 
such as dobutamine. For patients unable to exercise, vasodilators are 
the  most  commonly  used  stressors  in  combination  with  myocardial 
perfusion  imaging.  Dobutamine  is  a  potent  β1-receptor  agonist  that 
increases  myocardial  oxygen  demand  by  augmenting  contractility, 
heart rate, and blood pressure similar to exercise. It is generally used as 
an alternative to vasodilator stress in patients with chronic pulmonary 
disease, in whom vasodilators may be contraindicated. Dobutamine is 
also commonly used as a pharmacologic alternative to stress testing in 
stress echocardiography.

and Sonosite (right).

abnormalities. Transesophageal echocardiography requires both topi-
cal and systemic anesthesia, generally conscious sedation, and carries 
additional risks such as potential damage to the esophagus, including 
the  rare  possibility  of  perforation,  aspiration,  and  anesthesia-related 
complications. Patients generally need to give consent for transesopha-
geal echocardiography and be monitored during and subsequent to the 
procedure.  Transesophageal  echocardiography  can  be  carried  out  in 
intubated patients and is routinely used for intraoperative monitoring 
during cardiac surgery.

Stress echocardiography is routinely used to assess cardiac function 
during exercise and can be used to identify myocardial ischemia or to 
assess valvular function under exercise conditions. Stress echocardiog-
raphy is typically performed in conjunction with treadmill or bicycle 
exercise  testing,  but  it  can  also  be  performed  using  pharmacologic 
stress, most typically with an intravenous infusion of dobutamine (see 
section on stress imaging below).

Whereas  typical  echocardiographic  equipment  is  large,  bulky,  and 
expensive,  small  hand-held  or  point-of-care  ultrasound  (POCUS) 
equipment  developed  over  the  past  decade  now  offers  diagnostic 
quality  imaging  in  a  package  small  enough  to  be  carried  on  rounds  
(Fig.  241-4).  These  relatively  inexpensive  point-of-care  devices  are 
slowly  gaining  full  diagnostic  capabilities  but  currently  represent  an 
excellent screening tool if used by an experienced operator. As these 
units become even smaller and less expensive, they are being increas-
ingly  used  not  just  by  cardiologists  but  also  by  emergency  medicine 
physicians, intensivists, anesthesiologists, and internists.

Nevertheless, echocardiography is a nontomographic modality. The 
image obtained is dependent on the skill of the operator who, holding 
a transducer, identifies standard views from which measurements can 
be made. Images that are obtained off-axis can result in incorrect mea-
surements, such as chamber volumes or ejection fraction. As point-of-
care echocardiography becomes more commonplace, practitioners will 
need sufficient training to obtain and interpret images.

Myocardial strain or deformation imaging has emerged as an alter-
native  way  to  assess  cardiac  contractile  performance.  Global  and/or 
regional myocardial strain can be assessed either by Doppler or, more

gated myocardial perfusion images from which one can determine the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities and calculate left ventricular volumes and ejection

Myocardial  Perfusion  and  Viability  Imaging  Protocols  
Imaging protocols are tailored to the individual patient based on the 
clinical  question,  patient’s  risk,  ability  to  exercise,  body  mass  index, 
and other factors.

For  SPECT  imaging,  technetium-99m  (99mTc)-labeled  tracers  are 
the  most  commonly  used  imaging  agents  because  they  are  associ-
ated with the best image quality and the lowest radiation dose to the 
patient (Fig. 241-5). Selection of the protocol (stress-only, single-day, 
or  2-day)  depends  on  the  patient  and  clinical  question.  After  intra-
venous  injection,  myocardial  uptake  of  99mTc-labeled  tracers  is  rapid  
(1–2 min). After uptake, these tracers become trapped intracellularly in 
mitochondria and show minimal change over time. This is why  99mTc 
tracers  can  be  helpful  in  patients  with  chest  pain  of  unclear  etiology 
occurring at rest, because patients can be injected while having chest 
pain  and  imaged  some  time  later  after  symptoms  subside.  Indeed, 
a  normal  myocardial  perfusion  study  following  a  rest  injection  in  a 
patient with active chest pain effectively excludes myocardial ischemia 
as the cause of chest pain (high negative predictive value). While used 
commonly  in  the  past  for  perfusion  imaging,  thallium-201  protocols 
are now rarely used because they are associated with a higher radiation 
dose to the patient.

PET myocardial perfusion imaging is an alternative to SPECT and 
is  associated  with  improved  diagnostic  accuracy  and  lower  radiation 
dose to patients (Table 241-1). The ultra-short half-life of some PET 
radiopharmaceuticals in clinical use (e.g., rubidium-82) is the primary 
reason why imaging is generally combined with pharmacologic stress, 
as  opposed  to  exercise.  However,  exercise  is  possible  for  relatively 
longer-lived radiotracers (e.g.,  13N-ammonia). PET imaging protocols 
are typically faster than SPECT but more expensive. In comparison to 
SPECT, PET has improved spatial and contrast resolution and provides 
absolute measures of myocardial perfusion (in mL/min per gram of tis-
sue), thereby providing the patients’ regional and global coronary flow 
reserve. The latter helps improve diagnostic accuracy and risk stratifi-
cation, especially in obese patients, women, and higher risk individuals 
(e.g., diabetes mellitus) (Fig. 241-6). Contemporary PET and SPECT 

scanners  are  combined  with  a  CT  scanner  (so-called  hybrid  PET/CT 
and  SPECT/CT).  CT  is  used  primarily  to  guide  patient  positioning 
in the field of view and for correcting inhomogeneities in radiotracer 
distribution  due  to  attenuation  by  soft  tissues  (so-called  attenuation 
correction).  However,  it  can  also  be  used  to  obtain  diagnostic  data 
including  coronary  artery  calcium  (CAC)  score  and/or  CT  coronary 
angiography (discussed below).

For the evaluation of myocardial viability in patients with ischemic 
cardiomyopathy, myocardial perfusion imaging (with SPECT or PET) 
is usually combined with metabolic imaging (i.e., fluorodeoxyglucose 
[FDG]  PET).  In  hospital  settings  lacking  access  to  PET  scanning,  
thallium-201 SPECT imaging is an excellent alternative. FDG PET is 
also used in the evaluation of myocardial and vascular inflammation 
and in patients with suspected infective endocarditis.

Bone scintigraphy with SPECT is currently used for the evaluation 
of  patients  with  suspected  cardiac  amyloidosis.  As  discussed  below 
under  applications  in  new-onset  heart  failure,  bone-seeking  99mTc 
radiotracers (Table 241-1) are currently used to diagnose transthyretin 
cardiac amyloidosis with high accuracy.

 ■ CARDIAC COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY
CT acquires images by passing a thin x-ray beam through the body at 
many angles to generate cross-sectional images. The x-ray transmission 
measurements are collected by a detector array and digitized into pixels 
that  form  an  image.  The  grayscale  information  in  individual  pixels 
is determined by the attenuation of the x-ray beam along its path by 
tissues of different densities, referenced to the value for water in units 
known as Hounsfield units. In the resulting CT images, bone appears 
bright white, air is black, and blood and muscle show varying shades of 
gray. However, due to the limited contrast between cardiac chambers 
and  vascular  structures,  iodinated  contrast  agents  are  necessary  for 
most  cardiovascular  indications.  Cardiac  CT  produces  tomographic 
images  of  the  heart  and  surrounding  structures.  With  modern  CT 
scanners, a three-dimensional dataset of the heart can be acquired in 
5–15 s with submillimeter spatial resolution.

CT  Calcium  Scoring  CT  calcium  scoring  is  the 
simplest application of cardiac CT and does not require 
administration  of  iodinated  contrast.  The  presence  of 
coronary  artery  calcification  has  been  associated  with 
increased  burden  of  atherosclerosis  and  cardiovascular 
mortality.  Coronary  calcium  is  then  quantified  (e.g., 
Agatston  score)  and  categorized  as  minimal  (0–10), 
mild  (10–100),  moderate  (100–400),  or  severe  (>400)  
(Fig.  241-7).  CAC  scores  are  then  normalized  by  age 
and  gender  and  reported  as  percentile  scores.  Popula-
tion-based studies in asymptomatic cohorts have reported 
high cardiac prognostic value of CT calcium score. With 
appropriate  techniques,  the  radiation  dose  associated 
with CAC scanning is very low (~1–2 mSv).

CT  Coronary  Angiography  Coronary  CT  angiog-
raphy (CTA) is a clinically important alternative to stress 
testing in selected patients with suspected CAD. Imaging 
of  the  coronary  arteries  by  CT  is  challenging  because 
of  their  small  luminal  size  and  because  of  cardiac  and 
respiratory  motion.  Respiratory  motion  can  be  reduced 
by  breath-holding,  and  cardiac  motion  is  best  reduced 
by  slowing  the  patient’s  heart  rate,  ideally  to  under  60 
beats/min,  using  intravenous  or  oral  beta  blockade  or 
other rate-lowering drugs. When performing a coronary 
CTA, image quality is further enhanced using sublingual 
nitroglycerin to enlarge the coronary lumen just prior to 
contrast  injection.  Imaging  the  whole-heart  volume  is

timed  intravenous  iodinated  contrast.  Image  acquisition  is  linked  to 
the timing of the cardiac cycle through ECG triggering. The resulting 
images are then postprocessed using a three-dimensional workstation, 
which facilitates interpretation of the coronary anatomy and estimation 
of the severity of atherosclerosis (Fig. 241-7). A modified version of the 
enhanced protocol outlined for coronary CTA is used for the evalua-
tion of patients with structural heart disease, especially for preproce-
dural planning of those undergoing transcatheter valve replacement.
 ■ CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE
Cardiac  magnetic  resonance  (CMR)  imaging  is  based  on  imaging  of 
protons  in  hydrogen,  which  is  an  advantage,  given  the  abundance  of 
water  in  the  human  body.  When  the  body  is  placed  inside  an  MRI 
scanner, protons in different tissues, such as in simple fluid or complex 
macromolecules  such  as  fat  or  protein,  interact  with  the  magnetic 
field  at  their  unique  frequencies.  A  set  of  orthogonal  gradient  coils 
in  the  scanner  is  designed  to  locate  protons  spatially  so  that  radio-
frequency  (RF)  pulses  of  energy  can  be  delivered  to  select  imaging 
planes of interest. Once the RF pulses stop, the energy absorbed will 
be released, collected by the phased-array receiver coils placed on the 
patient’s  body  surface,  digitally  recorded  in  a  data  matrix  known  as  
the K-space, and then reconstructed into a magnetic resonance image. 
The large arrays of software methods of delivering RF pulses are known 
as pulse sequences, which aim at extraction of different types of cardiac 
structural  or  physiologic  information.  In  CMR,  T1-weighted  pulse 
sequences  are  most  common,  and  they  assess  cardiac  structure  and 
function,  blood  flow,  and  myocardial  perfusion  with  pharmacologic 
stress.  T2-weighted  and  T2*-weighted  pulse  sequences,  on  the  other 
hand,  evaluate  myocardial  edema  and  myocardial  iron  infiltration, 
respectively. In recent years, T1 and T2 mapping have become routinely 
used in experienced centers in quantifying myocardial tissue character-
istics, with T1 mapping most commonly used to scale the spectrum of 
myocardial inflammation or fibrosis and T2 mapping for myocardial 
edema.  Using  a  combination  of  these  methods  (above),  a  CMR  can 
accurately assess cardiac structure and function, myocardial infarction, 
ischemia,  and  infiltration.  Currently,  the  most  common  indications 
for  CMR  include  assessing  etiology  of  cardiomyopathy,  detection  of 
myocardial  ischemia  from  other  chest  pain  syndromes,  and  defining 
myocardial substrates of arrhythmias. Vector ECG-gating and repeti-
tive patient breath-holding are used by convention to suppress cardiac 
and respiratory motions, respectively. However, with technical advent, 
rapid data collection algorithm and diaphragmatic position gating have 
eliminated the need for ECG-gating and breath-holding in challenging 
situations. A list of common pulse sequences used in CMR is shown 
in Table 241-2.

ASSESSMENT OF CARDIAC STRUCTURE 
AND FUNCTION
Echocardiography,  CMR,  and  cardiac  CT  are  all  capable  of  assessing 
cardiac structure and function, although echocardiography is generally 
considered the primary imaging method for these assessments. Radio-
nuclide imaging can also be used to assess left ventricular regional and 
global systolic function. Echocardiography is most often used to assess 
the size of all four chambers and thickness of ventricular walls, which 
are affected by both cardiac and systemic diseases.

The  structure  of  the  left  ventricle  is  generally  assessed  by  deter-
mining  its  volume  and  mass.  Left  ventricular  volumes  can  be  easily 
estimated from 2D echocardiography by using methods incorporating 
geometric  assumptions.  The  accuracy  of  these  echocardiographic 
methods is reduced when foreshortening of the imaging plane leads to 
underestimation of volumes. Moreover, these methods require accurate 
delineation of the endocardial border. In this regard, high-resolution 
tomographic techniques such as CMR or cardiac CT are more accurate 
for volumetric assessment. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography 
does not require any geometric assumptions about the left ventricle for 
quantification of volumes and ejection fraction. However, 3D echocar-
diographic imaging requires substantial expertise and currently is not 
widely used in practice.

Left  ventricular  dilatation  is  common  to  a  number  of  cardiac  dis-
eases.  For  example,  regional  dysfunction  secondary  to  myocardial 
infarction  can  ultimately  lead  to  progressive  ventricular  dilatation  or 
remodeling.  Although  dilatation  often  begins  in  the  region  affected 
by  the  infarction,  subsequent  compensatory  dilatation  can  occur  in 
remote  myocardial  regions  as  well.  The  presence  of  regional  wall 
motion abnormalities associated with ventricular thinning (reflecting 
scar) in a coronary distribution is strongly suggestive of an ischemic 
etiology.  Regional  wall  motion  can  be  accurately  assessed  by  echoc-
ardiography,  CMR,  and  cardiac  CT.  Direct  assessment  of  infarcted 
myocardium is possible with both CMR (evident as areas of late gad-
olinium  enhancement  [LGE])  and  radionuclide  imaging  (as  assessed 
by regional perfusion or metabolic defects at rest). CMR can be partic-
ularly useful in determining etiology of cardiomegaly and ventricular 
dysfunction, with LGE in coronary distributions being nearly pathog-
nomonic for infarction (Video 241-1).

More  global  ventricular  dilatation  is  seen  in  cardiomyopathy  and 
dilatation  due  to  valvular  heart  disease.  Idiopathic,  nonischemic 
cardiomyopathies  will  typically  result  in  global  ventricular  dilatation 
and dysfunction, with thinning of the walls. Patients with substantial 
ventricular dyssynchrony due to conduction abnormalities will have a 
typical pattern of contraction (e.g., delay of contraction of the lateral 
wall with left bundle branch block). As discussed later in this chapter, 
regurgitant  lesions  of  either  the  mitral  or  aortic  valves  can  lead  to 
substantial ventricular dilatation, and assessment of ventricular size is 
integral  in  the  evaluation  and  timing  of  surgical  correction.  Because 
changes  in  ventricular  size  are  used  clinically  to  determine  which 
patients should undergo valve surgery, accurate assessment of changes 
in  ventricular  size  is  essential.  Although  serial  echocardiography  can 
provide these data, serial assessment by CMR may be more accurate 
when appreciation of subtle changes over time is important.

Left  ventricular  wall  thickness  and  mass  are  also  important  mea-
sures of cardiac and systemic disease. The left ventricle will hypertro-
phy under any condition in which its afterload is increased, including 
conditions that obstruct outflow, such as aortic stenosis, hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy,  and  subaortic  membranes;  in  postcardiac  aortic 
obstruction  seen  in  coarctation;  or  in  systemic  conditions  charac-
terized  by  increased  afterload,  such  as  hypertension.  The  pattern  of 
ventricular hypertrophy can change depending on the etiology. Aortic 
stenosis  and  hypertension  are  typically  characterized  by  concentric 
hypertrophy,  in  which  the  ventricular  walls  thicken  “concentrically”

1838 and  cavity  size  is  usually  small.  In  volume  overload  conditions  such 
as  mitral  or  aortic  regurgitation,  there  may  be  minimal  increase  in 
ventricular wall thickness, but substantial ventricular dilatation leads 
to marked increases in left ventricular mass.

of  diastolic  parameters,  including  Doppler  tissue-based  relaxation 
velocities, pulmonary venous Doppler, and left atrial size (Fig. 241-8). 
Diastolic function worsens with aging, and most diastolic parameters 
need to be adjusted for age.

Ventricular  wall  thickness  can  be  measured  and  ventricular  mass 
can  be  calculated  by  either  echocardiography  or  CMR.  Although 
radionuclide  imaging  and  cardiac  CT  can  also  provide  measures  of 
left  ventricular  mass,  they  are  not  generally  used  for  this  purpose. 
Although  measurement  of  wall  thickness  with  echocardiography  is 
relatively  straightforward  and  accurate,  determining  left  ventricular 
mass by echocardiography requires using one of several formulas that 
takes into account both wall thickness and ventricular cavity dimen-
sions. Assessment of left ventricular mass by CMR has the advantage 
of not requiring geometric assumptions and is thus more accurate than 
echocardiography.

 ■ ASSESSMENT OF LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC 
FUNCTION
Assessment of ejection fraction, or the percentage of blood ejected with 
each  beat,  has  been  the  primary  method  to  assess  systolic  function 
and  is  generally  calculated  by  subtracting  end-systolic  volume  from 
end-diastolic volume and dividing by end-diastolic volume. All cardiac 
imaging modalities can provide direct measurements of left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF). As discussed above, tomographic techniques 
(e.g., CMR, CT, and radionuclide imaging) are generally more accurate 
and reproducible than echocardiography because there are no geomet-
ric assumptions and these techniques are not dependent on operator 
skill. An LVEF of 55% or greater is generally considered normal, and 
an LVEF of 50–55% is considered in the low-normal range, although 
these can vary widely; normal ejection fraction tends to be higher in 
women than in men.

Newer methods to assess systolic function, such as myocardial strain 
or  deformation  imaging  using  speckle-tracking  methods  on  echoc-
ardiography,  or  myocardial  tagging  or  feature  tracking  on  CMR,  can 
provide a more sensitive approach to detection of systolic dysfunction, 
in part, because these measures are geometry independent. Additional 
assessments based on these novel methods include assessment of myo-
cardial twist and torsion. Regional strain patterns can differ in various 
diseases.  For  example,  in  cardiac  amyloidosis,  it  is  common  to  see  a 
reduction  in  myocardial  strain  at  the  base  of  the  heart  with  relative 
sparing of the apex. Strain imaging is being used more commonly in 
conditions such as valvular heart disease and early detection of cardi-
otoxicity following chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In addition 
to estimation or calculation of ejection fraction, stroke volume can be 
assessed by any of the imaging methods, by subtracting the end-systolic 
volume from the end-diastolic volume, or by quantifying forward flows 
using  echocardiographic  Doppler  methods  or  phase-contrast  CMR 
imaging. They offer measures of systolic function other than LVEF.

 ■ ASSESSMENT OF LEFT VENTRICULAR DIASTOLIC 
FUNCTION
Echocardiography  remains  the  primary  method  for  clinical  assess-
ment  of  diastolic  function,  in  part,  because  echocardiography  has 
the highest temporal resolution of all the imaging techniques. Recent 
advances  in  Doppler  tissue  imaging  allow  for  accurate  assessment  of 
the  velocity  of  myocardial  wall  motion  by  assessing  the  excursion  of 
the  mitral  annulus  in  diastole.  Mitral  annular  relaxation  velocity,  or 
E′, is inversely related to the time constant of relaxation, tau, and has 
been  shown  to  have  prognostic  significance  in  patients  with  heart 
failure. Dividing the standard mitral inflow maximal velocity, E, by the 
mitral annular relaxation velocity yields E/E′, which has been shown to 
correlate with left ventricular filling pressures. The utility of standard 
E and A wave ratios for assessment of diastolic function has been ques-
tioned. Mitral deceleration time can be a useful measure if very short  
(<150 ms), suggesting restrictive physiology and severe diastolic dys-
function.  Left  atrial  volume  is  considered  an  integrator  of  diastolic 
function, and minimal volume may be more reflective of left ventricu-
lar filling pressures than maximal volume. Several grading methods for 
diastolic function have been proposed that take into account a number 

 ■ ASSESSMENT OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR 
FUNCTION
Right  ventricular  size  and  function  have  been  shown  to  be  prognos-
tically  important  in  a  variety  of  conditions  and  can  be  assessed  by 
echocardiography, CMR, CT, or radionuclide imaging methods. CMR 
is considered the most accurate noninvasive technique to evaluate the 
structure  and  ejection  fraction  of  the  right  ventricle  (Video  241-2). 
Assessment  of  the  right  ventricle  by  echocardiography  has  generally 
been  qualitative,  owing  in  part  to  the  unusual  geometry  of  the  right 
ventricle.  However,  several  quantitative  methods  are  available  for 
assessment  of  right  ventricular  function,  including  fractional  area 
change (FAC = [diastolic area – systolic area]/diastolic area), which has 
been shown to correlate with outcomes in heart failure and after myo-
cardial infarction. Excursion of the tricuspid annulus (tricuspid annu-
lar plane systolic excursion [TAPSE]) is another method to assess right 
ventricular function, although it is mostly used in research settings.

Abnormalities  of  right  ventricular  size  and  function  are  generally 
secondary to either diseases that affect the right ventricle intrinsically 
or disease in which the right ventricle responds to abnormalities else-
where  in  the  heart  or  pulmonary  vasculature.  Intrinsic  diseases  that 
affect  the  right  ventricle  include  congenital  abnormalities,  including 
hypoplastic right ventricle and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dys-
plasia, and acquired conditions, such as right ventricular infarction and 
infiltrative diseases. Right ventricular dilatation can occur due to both 
chronic and acute processes. Long-standing pulmonary hypertension 
or  pulmonary  outflow  tract  obstruction  leads  to  right  ventricular 
hypertrophy and ultimately dilatation. An acute process that can cause 
profound right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction is acute pulmo-
nary embolism. In the setting of acute occlusion of a pulmonary artery 
or  branch,  an  acute  rise  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  causes  a 
previously normal right ventricle to dilate and fail due to the increased 
afterload.  In  acute  pulmonary  embolism,  right  ventricular  dilatation 
and  dysfunction  are  signs  of  substantial  hemodynamic  compromise 
and are associated with a marked increased risk of death. In addition to 
right ventricular dilatation, acute pulmonary embolism is often asso-
ciated with a specific pattern of regional right ventricular dysfunction, 
commonly referred to as the McConnell sign, characterized by preser-
vation of right ventricular wall motion in the basal and apical regions 
and dyskinesis in the region of the mid right ventricular free wall. This 
abnormality  is  highly  specific  for  acute  pulmonary  embolism  and  is 
likely secondary to acute increases in right ventricular load.

Any disease that causes increased pulmonary vascular resistance can 
lead to right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. For example, long-
standing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increases pulmonary 
vascular  resistance  and  results  in  cor  pulmonale.  Acute  pneumonia 
can cause findings that are similar to acute pulmonary embolism, and 
right ventricular dysfunction has been a hallmark of severe COVID-19 
disease  due  to  either  macro-  or  microthrombosis  in  the  pulmonary 
vasculature. In patients with right ventricular dilatation without obvi-
ous  pulmonary  disease,  intracardiac  shunts  should  be  considered. 
The increased flow through the pulmonary vasculature as a result of 
an  atrial  septal  or  ventricular  septal  defect  can,  over  time,  result  in 
elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance with subsequent dilatation 
and hypertrophy of the right ventricle. Right ventricular dilatation and 
dysfunction can be seen in left-sided heart disease, and patients who 
develop RV dilatation and dysfunction due to predominantly left-sided 
disease have worse outcomes.

In  addition  to  assessment  of  left  and  right  ventricular  structure 
and function, assessment of the other cardiac chambers also provides 
important clues to intracardiac and systemic diseases. Enlargement of 
the  left  atrium  is  common  in  patients  with  hypertension  and  is  also 
suggestive  of  increased  left  ventricular  filling  pressures;  indeed,  left 
atrial size is often termed the “hemoglobin A1c” of diastolic function 
because  left  atrial  enlargement  reflects  long-standing  increase  in

PATIENT SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
 ■ RADIATION EXPOSURE
Both cardiac CT and radionuclide imaging expose patients to ionizing 
radiation. Several recent publications have raised concern regarding the 
potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation associated with cardiac 
imaging. The effective dose is a measure used to estimate the biologic 
effects of radiation and is expressed in millisieverts (mSv). However, 
measuring the radiation effective dose associated with diagnostic imag-
ing is complex and imprecise and often results in varying estimates, even 

among experts. The effective dose from a typical myocardial perfusion 
SPECT scan ranges between ~4 and 11 mSv, depending on the protocol 
and type of scanner used. The effective dose from a typical myocardial 
perfusion PET scan is lower, ~2.0–4 mSv. Radiation exposure associated 
with  cardiac  CT  is  variable  and,  as  with  radionuclide  imaging,  also 
depends on the imaging protocol and scanner used. Although historic 
radiation doses with cardiac CT have been quite high, the introduction 
of newer technologies (e.g., x-ray tube modulation, prospective ECG 
gating) has resulted in a significant dose reduction. The current aver-
age radiation dose for a coronary CTA ranges from 3 to 15 mSv and, 
in selected cases, can be as low as 1 mSv. Imaging laboratories follow 
the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle when balancing 
the  clinical  need  and  imaging  approach.  By  comparison,  the  average 
dose for invasive coronary angiography is ~7 mSv, whereas exposure

1840 to radiation from natural sources in the United States amounts to ~3 

mSv annually.

The risk of a fatal malignancy from medical imaging–related radia-
tion is difficult to estimate precisely but is likely small and difficult to 
discern from the background risk of natural malignancies. The small 
but potential radiation risks from imaging mandate an assessment of 
the risk-versus-benefit ratio in the individual patient. In this context, 
one must not fail to take into account the risks of missing important 
diagnostic information by not performing a test (which could poten-
tially influence near-term management and outcomes) for a theoretical 
concern of a small long-term risk of malignancy. Before ordering any 
test, especially one associated with ionizing radiation, we must ensure 
the  appropriateness  of  the  study  and  that  the  potential  benefits  out-
weigh  the  risks.  The  likelihood  that  the  study  being  considered  will 
affect clinical management of the patient should be addressed before 
testing is performed. It is also important that “routine” follow-up scans 
in asymptomatic individuals be avoided.
 ■ CONTRAST AGENTS
Contrast agents are commonly used in cardiac CT, CMR, and echoc-
ardiography. Although their use significantly enhances the diagnostic 
information of each of these tests, there are also potential risks from the 
administration of contrast agents that should be considered.

The  risk  of  adverse  reactions  from  iodinated  contrast  agents  used 
in cardiac CT is well established. The precise pathogenesis of contrast 
reactions following intravascular administration of iodinated contrast 
media  is  not  known.  The  overall  incidence  of  contrast  reactions  is 
0.4–3% with nonionic formulations and higher for ionic formulations. 
Most contrast adverse reactions are mild and self-limiting. The risk of 
contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with relatively normal 
renal  function  (estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  [eGFR]  >60  mL/
min) is low. In most patients, CIN is self-limited, and renal function 
usually  returns  to  baseline  within  7–10  days,  without  progressing  to 
chronic  renal  failure.  However,  this  risk  increases  in  patients  with 
GFR <60 mL/min, especially older diabetic subjects. In such patients, 
appropriate screening and pre- and postscan hydration are necessary.

The use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) enhances the 
versatility  of  CMR  imaging.  There  are  many  commercially  available 
GBCAs  in  the  United  States,  but  their  use  in  cardiac  imaging  is  off- 
label. Mild reactions from GBCAs, such as skin pruritus or erythema, 
occur in ~1% of patients, but severe or anaphylactic reactions are very 
rare  at  ~1  in  100,000  patients.  All  GBCAs  are  chelated  to  make  the 
compounds  nontoxic  and  facilitate  renal  excretion.  Older  generation 
(group  I)  linear-structured  GBCAs  have  been  associated  with  a  rare 
but serious condition known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), 
which is an interstitial inflammatory reaction manifested as fibrosis of 
tissues  or  internal  organs  and  even  death.  Risk  factors  to  developing 
NSF  include  high-dose  use  in  presence  of  severe  renal  dysfunction 
(eGFR  <30  mL/min  per  1.73  m2),  need  for  hemodialysis,  an  eGFR 
<15  mL/min  per  1.73  m2,  acute  renal  deterioration,  and  concur-
rent proinflammatory/systemic illnesses. Newer-generation (group II) 
macrocyclic-structured  GBCAs  have  a  substantially  improved  safety 
profile,  including  in  patients  with  chronic  kidney  dysfunction  and, 
indeed,  have  become  the  agents  of  choice  in  most  MRI  centers.  The 

American  College  of  Radiology  considers  the  use  of  group  II  agents 
as safe, including in patients with renal dysfunction or dialysis. With 
widespread  use  of  group  II  GBCAs,  routine  pretest  screening,  and 
weight-based dosing, a near-zero incidence of NSF has been reported 
in the past decade.

Contrast  agents  can  also  be  used  in  echocardiography.  Injected 
agitated saline is used routinely to assess cardiac shunts, because these 
“bubbles”  are  too  large  to  traverse  the  pulmonary  circulation.  After 
saline injection, the presence of bubbles in the left side of the heart is 
indicative of shunt, although the location can sometimes be difficult to 
determine.  The  current  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)–
approved use of echocardiographic contrast agents is for opacification 
of  left-sided  chambers  and  to  improve  delineation  of  left  ventricular 
endocardial  border  in  patients  with  suboptimal  echocardiograms. 
These  agents  are  either  albumin-  or  lipid-based  microspheres  filled 
with  inert  gases,  typically  perfluorocarbons.  They  are  considered 
extremely safe, although they have, in extremely rare instances, been 
associated with allergic reactions and neurologic events.

 ■ SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS OF CMR IN PATIENTS 
WITH PACEMAKERS AND DEFIBRILLATORS
There are now multiple FDA-approved MRI-conditional internal car-
diac defibrillators and pacemakers that are safe for patients who need 
an MRI study. For non-FDA-approved cardiac devices (legacy devices), 
collective  evidence  has  indicated  that  MRI  studies  can  be  safely  per-
formed at 1.5 T under normal operational settings, in the absence of 
fractured,  epicardial,  or  abandoned  leads,  and  when  an  experienced 
staff is available to interrogate the cardiac device before and after the 
MRI  study.  The  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid  Services  have 
approved  and  expanded  coverage  of  MRI  studies  in  patients  with  an 
implanted legacy device.

PATIENT-CENTERED APPLICATIONS OF 
CARDIAC IMAGING
 ■ CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
The  basis  for  the  diagnostic  application  of  imaging  tests  in  patients 
with  known  or  suspected  CAD  should  be  viewed  considering  the 
pretest  probability  of  disease  as  well  as  the  specific  characteristics  of 
imaging tests (i.e., sensitivity and specificity). In symptomatic patients, 
the prevalence or pretest probability of CAD differs based on the type 
of  symptom  (typical  angina,  atypical  angina,  noncardiac  chest  pain), 
as well as on age, gender, and coronary risk factors. In an individual 
patient, the results of the initial test inform the posttest likelihood of 
CAD.  In  patients  undergoing  sequential  testing  (e.g.,  ECG  treadmill 
testing followed by stress imaging), the posttest probability of disease 
after the first test becomes the pretest likelihood of disease for the sec-
ond test. Regardless of the sequence, the expectation is that a test will 
provide sufficient information to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of 
CAD and that such information will allow accurate risk stratification 
to be able to guide management decisions.

imaging modalities for the diagnosis of CAD.

It  is  important  to  highlight  that  most  studies  included  in  meta- 
analyses of the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac imaging modalities for 
the diagnosis of CAD were retrospective, small, single-center studies, 
comprising  predominantly  male  patients  with  a  high  prevalence  of 
CAD  (>50–60%).  Multicenter  studies  assessing  the  performance  of 
individual  modalities  or  comparing  different  modalities  have  consis-
tently  resulted  in  more  modest  diagnostic  accuracies,  tracking  more 
closely with how these tests perform in clinical practice.

Stress Echocardiography  The  hallmark  of  myocardial  ischemia 
during  stress  echocardiography  is  the  development  of  new  regional 
wall motion abnormalities and reduced systolic wall thickening (Video 
241-3).  Stress  echocardiography  can  be  performed  in  conjunction 
with exercise or dobutamine stress. Stress echocardiography is best at 
identifying inducible wall motion abnormalities in previously normally 
contracting segments. In a patient with wall motion abnormalities at 
rest, the specificity of stress echocardiography is reduced, and worsen-
ing regional function of a previously abnormal segment might reflect 
worsening  contractile  function  in  the  setting  of  increased  wall  stress 
rather than new evidence of inducible ischemia.

The advantages of stress echocardiography over other stress imaging 
techniques include its relatively good diagnostic accuracy, widespread 
availability, no use of ionizing radiation, and relatively low cost. Lim-
itations of stress echocardiography include (1) the technical challenges 
associated with image acquisition at peak exercise because of exertional 
hyperpnea  and  cardiac  excursion,  (2)  the  fact  that  rapid  recovery  of 
wall motion abnormalities can be seen with mild ischemia (especially 
with one-vessel disease, which limits sensitivity), (3) difficulty detect-
ing residual ischemia within an infarcted territory because of resting 
wall motion abnormality, (4) high operator dependence for acquisition 
of  echocardiographic  data  and  analysis  of  images,  and  (5)  the  fact 
that  good-quality  complete  images  viewing  all  myocardial  segments 
occur  in  only  85%  of  patients.  Newer  techniques,  including  second 
harmonic imaging and the use of intravenous contrast agents, improve 
image quality, but their effect on diagnostic accuracy has not been well 
documented.

As with nuclear perfusion imaging, stress echocardiography is often 
used for risk stratification in patients with suspected or known CAD. A 
negative stress echocardiogram is associated with an excellent progno-
sis, allowing identification of patients at low risk. Conversely, the risk 
of adverse events increases with the extent and severity of wall motion 
abnormalities on stress echocardiography.

Despite the widespread use and clinical acceptance of radionuclide 
imaging in CAD evaluation, a recognized limitation of this approach 
is that it often uncovers only coronary territories supplied by the most 
severe stenoses. Consequently, it is relatively insensitive to accurately 
delineate  the  extent  of  obstructive  angiographic  CAD,  especially  in 
the setting of multivessel disease. The use of quantitative myocardial 
blood flow and coronary flow reserve with PET can help mitigate this 
limitation.  In  patients  with  so-called  “balanced”  ischemia  or  diffuse 
CAD, measurements of coronary flow reserve uncover areas of myo-
cardium  at  risk  that  would  generally  be  missed  by  performing  only 
relative assessments of myocardial perfusion (Fig. 241-10). Conversely, 
a normal coronary flow reserve is associated with a very high negative 
predictive  value  for  excluding  high-risk  angiographic  CAD.  These 
measurements of coronary flow reserve also contribute to risk strati-
fication  across  the  spectrum  of  ischemic  changes,  including  patients 
with visually normal myocardial perfusion.
HYBRID  CT  AND  NUCLEAR  PERFUSION  IMAGING  Because  many  of 
the  newer  generation  nuclear  medicine  scanners  integrate  CT  and 
a  gamma  camera  in  the  same  acquisition  gantry,  it  is  now  possible 
to  acquire  and  quantify  myocardial  scar  and  ischemia  and  CAC 
scoring  from  a  single  dual-modality  study  (SPECT/CT  or  PET/CT)  
(Fig. 241-11). The rationale for this integrated approach is predicated 
on the fact that the perfusion imaging approach is designed to uncover 
only  obstructive  atherosclerosis.  Conversely,  CAC  scoring  provides  a 
quantitative  measure  of  the  anatomic  extent  of  atherosclerosis.  This 
provides an opportunity to improve the conventional models for risk 
assessment using nuclear imaging alone, especially in patients without 
known CAD.

Cardiac  CT  Voluminous  plaques  are  more  prone  to  calcification, 
and  stenotic  lesions  frequently  contain  large  amounts  of  calcium. 
Indeed, there is evidence that high CAC scores are generally predictive 
of a higher likelihood of obstructive CAD, and the available data support 
the concept of a threshold phenomenon governing this relationship (i.e., 
Agatston score >400). However, given the fact that CAC scores are not 
specific markers of obstructive CAD, one should be cautious in using 
this information as the basis for referral of patients to coronary angi-
ography, especially in symptomatic patients with low-risk stress tests. 
Conversely, CAC scores <400, especially in symptomatic patients with 
intermediate-high likelihood of CAD, as in those with typical angina, 
may be less effective in excluding CAD, especially in young symptomatic 
men and women who may have primarily noncalcified atherosclerosis  
(Fig. 241-12).

Stress  Radionuclide 
Imaging  SPECT 
myocardial  perfusion  imaging  is  the  most  com-
mon  form  of  stress  imaging  tests  for  CAD  eval-
uation.  The  presence  of  a  reversible  myocardial 
perfusion  defect  is  indicative  of  ischemia  (Fig. 
241-9, left panel), whereas a fixed perfusion defect 
generally  reflects  prior  myocardial  infarction  
(Fig. 241-9, right panel). As discussed above, PET 
has  advantages  compared  to  SPECT,  but  it  is  not 
widely available and is more expensive and, thus, 
considered  an  emerging  technology  in  clinical  
practice.

Nuclear  perfusion  imaging  is  another  robust 
approach  to  diagnose  obstructive  CAD,  quantify 
the  magnitude  of  inducible  myocardial  ischemia, 
assess the extent of tissue viability, and guide ther-
apeutic management (i.e., selection of patients for 
revascularization). One of the most valuable clin-
ical  applications  of  radionuclide  perfusion  imag-
ing  is  for  risk  stratification.  It  is  well  established 
that patients with a normal SPECT or PET study 
exhibit a low rate of major adverse cardiac events 
of  <1%  annually.  Importantly,  the  risks  of  death 
and  myocardial  infarction  increase  linearly  with 
increasing  magnitude  of  perfusion  abnormalities, 
reflecting the extent and severity of CAD.

As  discussed  above,  the  improved  temporal  and  spatial  resolution 
of  modern  multidetector  CT  scanners  offers  a  unique  noninvasive 
approach  to  delineate  the  extent  and  severity  of  coronary  athero-
sclerosis  with  coronary  CTA.  The  extremely  high  sensitivity  of  this 
approach  offers  a  very  effective  means  for  excluding  the  presence  of

is  reduced  because  the  blooming  artifact  of  calcium  does  not  allow 
one  to  evaluate  the  vessel  lumen  accurately.  Given  the  high  negative 
predictive  value  of  CTA,  a  normal  scan  result  effectively  excludes

obstructive  CAD  and  abolishes  the  need  for  further  investigation. 
As  discussed  below,  this  may  be  quite  useful  in  patients  with  low- 
intermediate  clinical  risk  presenting  to  the  emergency  department 
(ED) for chest pain. However, the limited capability of this technique to 
determine which coronary plaques are flow limiting can make abnor-
mal scan results more difficult to interpret, especially in terms of the 
possible need of revascularization. There are emerging data suggesting 
that by adding a stress myocardial perfusion CT evaluation (similar to 
stress perfusion CMR) (Fig. 241-13, top panel) or an estimated frac-
tional flow reserve (so-called FFRCT) (Fig. 241-13, lower panel), one 
can define the hemodynamic significance of anatomic stenosis. FFRCT 
is beginning to enter routine clinical practice. However, CT myocardial 
perfusion remains an emerging technology.

As with invasive coronary angiography, assessments of the extent of 
CAD by CTA can also provide useful prognostic information. A low 
1-year cardiac event rate has been reported for patients without cor-
onary atherosclerosis on CTA. For patients with obstructive CAD, the 
risk of adverse cardiac events increases proportionally with the extent 
of angiographically obstructive CAD. There is new evidence that even 
the  presence  of  nonobstructive  atherosclerosis  increases  the  risk  of 
adverse cardiac events.

Although CTA can be helpful in assessing patency of bypass grafts, 
the  assessment  of  stents  is  somewhat  more  challenging  because  the 
limited  spatial  resolution  of  CT  and  stent  diameter  (<3  mm  being 
associated with the highest number of partial lumen visualization and 
nondiagnostic scans) both contribute to limited clinical results.

CMR Imaging  CMR evaluates for ischemia from CAD by assess-
ing  regional  myocardial  perfusion  or  regional  wall  motion  at  rest 
and  during  pharmacologic  stress  with  an  intravenous  infusion  of 

vasodilator  agent  or  dobutamine.  Myocardial  perfusion  is  evaluated 
by  injecting  a  GBCA  bolus  followed  by  imaging  data  acquisition  as 
the  contrast  passes  through  the  cardiac  chambers  and  into  the  myo-
cardium.  Relative  perfusion  deficits  are  recognized  as  regions  of  low 
signal intensity (black) within the myocardium (Video 241-4). Several 
minutes after GBCA injection, LGE imaging allows detection of bright 
areas of myocardial scar (white), which permits comparison of regions 
of  hypoperfusion  and  infarction  to  quantify  myocardial  ischemia  
(Fig. 241-14).

With  better  delineation  of  the  endocardial  borders,  dobutamine 
CMR  has  better  diagnostic  accuracy  than  dobutamine  echocardiog-
raphy for detection of CAD, especially in patients with poor acoustic 
window (Table 241-3). High-dose dobutamine carries the risk of seri-
ous  ventricular  arrhythmias  (~1%),  but  most  cases  can  be  prevented 
with proper monitoring of vital signs and regional cine function. The 
advantages  of  stress  perfusion  CMR  over  SPECT  include  its  higher 
spatial resolution, which allows detection of subendocardial ischemia 
or  infarction  that  may  be  missed  by  SPECT.  As  with  other  imaging 
modalities, stress CMR studies also provide robust risk stratification. In 
a recent randomized controlled trial, a stress CMR–guided strategy was 
shown to improve the guidance toward the use of invasive investigation 
and coronary revascularization.

Selecting  a  Testing  Strategy  in  Patients  without  Known 
CAD  As discussed above, there are many options for the evaluation 
of a patient with suspected CAD presenting with chest pain symptoms. 
The critical questions to be answered by a testing strategy include the 
following: (1) Does the chest pain reflect obstructive CAD? (2) What 
are  the  short-  and  long-term  risks?  (3)  Does  the  patient  need  to  be 
considered  for  revascularization?  With  improved  guideline-directed

panel, representative views of coronary CT angiogram (CTA; left), coronary angiogram (middle), and stress myocardial perfusion CT (right) images in a patient with CAD and 
prior stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) are presented. On the CTA, the stent (arrows) is totally occluded as evidenced by the loss of contrast 
enhancement distal to the stent. The coronary angiogram demonstrates a concordant total occlusion of the LAD. On the perfusion CT images, there is a black rim (arrows) 
involving the anterior and anterolateral walls, indicating the lack of contrast opacification during stress consistent with myocardial ischemia. (Images courtesy of CORE 320 
investigators.) The lower panel illustrates an example of fractional flow reserve (FFR) estimates with coronary CTA (left) compared to the reference standard of invasive FFR. 
The FFR reflects the pressure differential between a coronary segment distal to a stenosis and the aorta. In normal coronary arteries, there is no gradient, and FFR is 1. An 
FFR <0.80 is consistent with a hemodynamically significant stenosis. (Images courtesy of Dr. James Min, Cornell University, New York.)

medical therapy (GDMT), large-scale clinical trials have indicated the 
benefits  of  GDMTs  in  which  the  majority  of  the  patients  with  stable 
CAD are at low risk of serious cardiac events on the basis of GDMT 
alone, with coronary revascularization best reserved for patients with 
severe symptoms despite adequate medical therapy. Imaging, however, 
will  continue  to  play  a  significant  role  in  diagnosing  the  etiology  of 
chest pain and risk assessment of individual patients.

FIGURE 241-14  The image shows the late gadolinium enhancement image of a mid 
short-axis view. There is no evidence of infarction in the anterior wall, which would 
be seen as bright white areas, indicating that the stress perfusion defect primarily 
represents myocardial ischemia. This patient had a significant stenosis of the left 
anterior descending coronary artery.

For symptomatic patients without a prior history of CAD and a normal 
or  nearly  normal  resting  ECG  who  are  able  to  exercise,  the  American  
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recom-
mend  standard  exercise  treadmill  testing  (ETT)  as  the  initial  testing 
strategy. The guidelines further suggest that patients who are catego-
rized as low risk by ETT (e.g., those achieving >10 metabolic equiva-
lents [METS] without chest pain or ECG changes) be treated initially 
with  medical  therapy,  and  those  with  high-risk  ETT  findings  (i.e., 
typical angina with >2 mm ST-segment depression in multiple leads, 
ST elevation during exercise, drop in blood pressure, or sustained ven-
tricular arrhythmias) be referred for coronary angiography.

The  use  of  exercise  testing  in  women  presents  difficulties  that  are 
not  seen  in  men,  reflecting  the  differences  in  the  lower  prevalence 
of obstructive CAD in women and the different accuracy of exercise 
testing  in  men  and  women.  Compared  with  men,  the  lower  pretest 
probability of disease in women means that more test results are false 
positive.  In  some  of  these  patients,  a  positive  ETT  may  reflect  true 
myocardial  ischemia  caused  by  microvascular  coronary  artery  dys-
function  (so-called  microvascular  disease).  In  addition,  the  inability 
of many women to exercise to maximum aerobic capacity, the greater 
prevalence  of  mitral  valve  prolapse  and  microvascular  disease,  and 
possibly other reasons may contribute to the differences with men as 
well. The difficulties of using exercise testing for diagnosing obstruc-
tive CAD in women have led to speculation that stress imaging may be 
preferred over standard stress testing. However, recent data from the 
WOMEN study suggest that in symptomatic, low-risk women who can 
exercise, standard ETT is a very effective initial diagnostic strategy as 
compared to stress radionuclide imaging. Indeed, the 2-year outcomes 
were similar in both diagnostic strategies, and the ETT-first approach 
resulted in 48% lower costs compared to exercise radionuclide imaging.
Patients who cannot undergo an ETT or those at intermediate-high 
risk after ETT (e.g., low exercise capacity, chest pain, and/or ST-segment 
depression  without  high-risk  features)  will  often  require  additional 
testing,  either  stress  imaging  or  coronary  CTA,  to  more  accurately 
characterize  clinical  risk.  Most  common  stress  imaging  strategies  in 
intermediate-risk patients include stress echocardiography and radio-
nuclide imaging. However, CMR and PET in experienced centers have 
both been shown to have higher test accuracy than SPECT, and CMR 
has  been  shown  to  be  more  cost-effective  than  SPECT.  In  patients

valuable in the intermediate-risk group. SPECT, single-photon emission computed tomography; VD, vessel disease. (Reproduced with permission from R Hachamovitch

CIR.93.5.905.)

with  intermediate  clinical  risk,  stress  imaging  with  either  SPECT  or 
echocardiography has been shown to accurately reclassify patients who 
are initially classified as intermediate risk by ETT as low or high risk  
(Fig. 241-15). Following this staged strategy of applying the low-cost 
ETT  first  and  reserving  more  expensive  imaging  to  refine  risk  strat-
ification  to  patients  initially  classified  as  intermediate  risk  by  ETT  is 
more  cost-effective  than  applying  stress  or  anatomic  imaging  as  the 
initial test routinely.

An imaging strategy is the recommended first step for patients who 
are unable to exercise to an adequate workload and/or those with abnor-
mal  resting  ECGs  (e.g.,  left  ventricular  hypertrophy  with  strain,  left 
bundle branch block). Importantly, the most recent documents regard-
ing appropriate use of imaging also considered that an imaging strategy 
may  be  an  appropriate  first  step  in  patients  with  intermediate-high 
likelihood of CAD (e.g., diabetics, renal impairment) due to increased 

overall sensitivity for diagnosis of CAD and improved risk stratification. 
In considering an imaging strategy, the evidence supporting the role of 
ischemia assessment versus anatomy must be considered. From the dis-
cussion above, for patients with atypical chest pain and a low pretest risk 
of CAD, a normal coronary CTA is helpful because it effectively excludes 
the presence of obstructive CAD and the need for further testing, defines 
a low clinical risk, and makes management decisions regarding referral 
to  coronary  angiography  straightforward.  However,  in  patients  with 
an  intermediate  or  higher  pretest  risk,  coronary  CTA  is  less  effective 
in  excluding  obstructive  CAD  owing  to  its  limited  accuracy  to  define 
stenosis severity and predict ischemia; however, abnormal CTA results 
are more problematic to interpret and to use as the basis for defining the 
potential need of invasive coronary angiography and revascularization. 
In such patients, a follow-up stress test is usually required to determine 
the possible need of revascularization (Fig. 241-16).

The justification of stress imaging in testing strategies 
has  hinged  on  the  identification  of  which  patients  may 
benefit from a revascularization strategy by means of non-
invasive estimates of jeopardized myocardium rather than 
angiography-derived  anatomic  stenoses.  However,  recent 
evidence from the ISCHEMIA trial suggests that optimal 
medical therapy provides comparable prognostic benefit to 
coronary revascularization in patients with moderate myo-
cardial  ischemia.  Coronary  revascularization  is  reserved 
for  patients  with  very  extensive  evidence  of  ischemia  by 
stress  imaging  and/or  inadequate  symptom  control  by 
optimal medical therapy. While the available data suggest 
similar  diagnostic  accuracy  for  SPECT  and  echocardiog-
raphy but higher for PET and CMR, the choice of strategy 
depends on availability and local expertise.

Selecting  a  Testing  Strategy  in  Patients  with 
Known  CAD  Use  and  selection  of  testing  strategies 
in  symptomatic  patients  with  established  CAD  (i.e., 
prior  angiography,  prior  myocardial  infarction,  prior 
revascularization)  differ  from  those  in  patients  without 
prior  CAD.  Although  standard  ETT  may  help  distin-
guish cardiac from noncardiac chest pain, exercise ECG 
has  several  limitations  following  myocardial  infarction 
and revascularization (especially coronary artery bypass 
grafting). These patients frequently have rest ECG abnor-
malities. In addition, there is a clinical need to document 
both  the  magnitude  and  localization  of  ischemia  to  be 
able  to  direct  therapy,  especially  the  potential  need  for 
targeted  revascularization.  Consequently,  imaging  tests 
are preferred for evaluating patients with known CAD.

There  are  also  important  differences  in  the  effec-
tiveness of imaging tests in these patients. As discussed 
above,  coronary  CTA  is  limited  in  patients  with  prior 
revascularization.  While  CTA  provides  excellent  visual-
ization  of  the  bypass  grafts,  the  native  circulation  tends 
to get heavily calcified and is generally not a good target 
for imaging with CTA. Likewise, blooming artifacts from 
metallic  stents  also  limit  the  application  of  coronary

1846 CTA in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention. If an 
anatomic strategy is indicated, direct referral to invasive angiography 
is preferred.

Stress  imaging  approaches  are  especially  useful  and  preferred  in 
symptomatic  patients  with  established  CAD.  As  in  patients  without 
prior  CAD,  normal  imaging  studies  in  symptomatic  patients  with 
established CAD also identify a low-risk cohort. In those with abnor-
mal stress imaging studies, the degree of abnormality relates to posttest 
risk. In addition, stress imaging approaches can localize and quantify 
the  magnitude  of  ischemia,  thereby  assisting  in  planning  targeted 
revascularization  procedures.  As  in  patients  without  prior  CAD,  the 
choice  of  stress  imaging  strategy  depends  on  availability  and  local 
expertise.

Testing Strategy Considerations in Patients Presenting with 
Chest Pain to the ED  Although acute chest pain is a frequent rea-
son for patient visits to the ED, only a small minority of those presen-
tations represent an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Strategies used in 
the evaluation of these patients include novel cardiac biomarkers (e.g., 
serum troponins), conventional stress testing (ETT), and noninvasive 
cardiac imaging. It is generally accepted that the primary goal of this 
evaluation is exclusion of ACS and other serious conditions rather than 
detection of CAD.

The  routine  evaluation  of  acute  chest  pain  in  most  centers  in  the 
United  States  includes  admission  to  a  chest  pain  unit  to  rule  out 
ACS with the use of serial ECGs and cardiac biomarkers. In selected 
patients, stress testing with or without imaging may be used for further 
risk  stratification.  Stress  echocardiography  and  radionuclide  imaging 
are  among  the  most  frequently  used  imaging  approaches  in  these 
patients.  Multiparametric  CMR  imaging  has  also  been  used  success-
fully in patients with acute chest pain (Video 241-5). Due to its ability 
to probe multiple aspects of myocardial physiology, cardiac anatomy, 
and tissue characterization with LGE imaging, CMR is useful in diag-
nosing conditions that mimic ACS (e.g., acute myocarditis, takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy, pericarditis) (Fig. 241-17).

FIGURE  241-17  A  four-chamber  long-axis  late  gadolinium  enhancement  (LGE) 
image of a patient with acute myocarditis. Note that the LGE primarily involved the 
epicardial aspect of the myocardium (arrows), sparing the endocardium, which is a 
feature that distinguishes myocarditis from myocardial infarction, which affects the 
endocardium. Also note the multiple foci of LGE in this case affecting the lateral wall 
of the left ventricle. Viral myocarditis often presents with this pattern.

As discussed above, coronary CTA is a rapid and accurate imaging 
technique  to  exclude  the  presence  of  CAD  and  is  well  suited  for  the 
evaluation  of  patients  with  acute  chest  pain (Fig. 241-18).  Four  ran-
domized  clinical  trials  have  demonstrated  the  feasibility,  safety,  and 
accuracy of coronary CTA in the ED as compared to usual care (which 
typically includes stress imaging). Patients in these trials had a very low 
clinical  risk.  Overall,  there  were  no  deaths  and  very  few  myocardial 
infarctions  without  differences  between  the  groups.  Likewise,  there 
were  no  differences  in  postdischarge  ED  visits  or  rehospitalizations. 
These studies showed decreased length of stay with coronary CTA, and 
most but not all reported cost savings. An observation from a recent 
meta-analysis was that, compared to usual care, more patients assigned 
to  coronary  CTA  underwent  cardiac  catheterization  (6.3%  vs  8.4%, 
respectively)  and  revascularization  (2.6%  vs  4.6%,  respectively).  The 
relative  increased  frequency  in  the  referral  to  cardiac  catheterization 
and revascularization after coronary CTA compared to stress imaging 
testing strategies has also been observed in patients with stable chest 
pain syndromes.

Taken together, the available data clearly suggest that not all patients 
presenting  with  acute  chest  pain  require  specialized  imaging  testing. 
Patients with very low clinical risk and negative biomarkers (especially 
high-sensitivity  troponin  assays)  can  be  safely  triaged.  The  use  of 
imaging tests in patients with low-intermediate risk should be carefully 
considered, especially given the trade-offs discussed above.

 ■ VALVULAR HEART DISEASE
Abnormalities  of  any  of  the  four  valvular  structures  in  the  heart  can 
lead  to  significant  cardiac  dysfunction,  heart  failure,  or  even  death. 
Echocardiography, CMR, and cardiac CT can be used for the evalua-
tion of valvular heart disease, although echocardiography is generally 
considered the first imaging test for the assessment of valvular heart 
disease.  In  addition,  echocardiography  is  the  most  cost-effective 
screening  method  for  valvular  heart  disease.  In  some  cases,  CMR 
can  complement  echocardiography  when  echocardiographic  acoustic 
window is inadequate, to quantify blood flow data more precisely, or 
to provide complimentary assessment of adjacent vascular structures 
relevant to the valvular condition.

Echocardiography  can  be  used  to  assess  both  regurgitant  and 
stenotic  lesions  of  any  of  the  cardiac  valves.  Typical  indications  for 
echocardiography to assess valvular heart disease include cardiac mur-
murs identified on physical examination, symptoms of breathlessness 
that may represent valvular heart disease, syncope or presyncope, and 
preoperative exams in patients undergoing bypass surgery. A standard 
echocardiographic examination should include qualitative and quanti-
tative assessment of all valves regardless of indication and should serve 
as an adequate screening test for significant valvular disease.

Assessment of Aortic Stenosis  Aortic stenosis, one of the most 
common  forms  of  valvular  heart  disease,  most  often  occurs  because 
of  gradual  progression  of  valvular  calcification  in  both  normal  and 
congenitally  abnormal  valves.  Assessment  of  aortic  stenosis  is  most 
commonly performed with echocardiography, although techniques for 
quantitative assessment of aortic stenosis with CMR have been devel-
oped  and  increasingly  used  over  the  past  decade.  Echocardiographic 
assessment  generally  begins  with  visual  inspection  of  the  valve.  This 
allows for assessment of valvular morphology, whether it is tricuspid, 
bicuspid,  or  some  variant;  degree  of  leaflet  calcification;  and  leaflet 
excursion.

The normal aortic valve consists of three leaflets or cusps: the right 
coronary, the left coronary, and the noncoronary cusps. Abnormalities 
of cusp development are some of the most common congenital heart 
anomalies,  the  most  common  of  which  is  bicuspid  aortic  valve,  with 
two opening leaflets rather than three (Fig. 241-19). The aortic valve 
can be visualized on echocardiography, although sometimes it can be 
difficult to distinguish true bicuspid aortic valve from variants, includ-
ing  the  presence  of  a  vestigial  commissure  (raphe).  Bicuspid  aortic 
valve, one of the most common congenital anomalies, predisposes to 
both aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency.

FIGURE 241-18  Representative coronary computed tomography angiographic (CTA) images of two patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain 
and negative biomarkers. The patient in A had angiographically normal coronary arteries; the panel shows a representative view of the right coronary artery (RCA). B 
and C show a corresponding significant stenosis in the mid portion of the RCA on both the CTA (B) and invasive angiographic view (C). (Images used with permission from  
Dr. Quynh Truong, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.)

The  degree  of  aortic  stenosis  is  assessed  by  estimating  both  the 
pressure  gradient  across  the  valve  and  the  valve  area.  Patients  with 
moderate aortic stenosis or higher generally have peak instantaneous 
velocities  of  3.0  m/s  and  higher,  and  often  higher  than  4.0  m/s,  cor-
responding  to  pressure  gradients  of  36  and  64  mmHg,  respectively. 
Because  pressure  gradients  across  the  aortic  valve  can  be  underesti-
mated in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, estimation of 
valve area by the continuity principle is the most accurate technique for 
assessing the severity of the stenosis. However, evaluation of the patient 
with so-called low-flow or low-gradient aortic stenosis can be challeng-
ing  and  sometimes  requires  provocative  testing  such  as  dobutamine 
echocardiography. In these cases, it is important to distinguish whether 
the valve is indeed capable of opening further or simply behaving like a 
stenotic valve because of the low-pressure gradient.

Aortic  valve  areas  <1.0  cm2  are  generally  considered  severe,  and 
valve areas <0.6 cm2 are considered critical. Because patients with good 
left ventricular function can often tolerate severe aortic stenosis for a 
considerable period of time, valve areas or gradients alone should not 
be  used  to  determine  whether  an  individual  patient  should  undergo 
aortic valve surgery as this remains a clinical decision.

Some patients with apparent aortic stenosis have subvalvular or even 
supravalvular  obstruction.  Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  represents 
the classic form of subvalvular aortic stenosis, but this is usually easily 
distinguished  from  aortic  stenosis  on  echocardiography  as  the  valve 
leaflets can be seen opening during systole. Subaortic membranes can 
behave  very  similarly  to  leaflet  aortic  stenosis,  and  the  membranes 
themselves  can  be  very  thin  and  difficult  to  visualize,  although  the 
presence of a murmur, a gradient across the valve with aortic leaflets 
that  appear  to  open  normally,  is  highly  suggestive  of  a  membrane. 
Supravalvular aortic stenosis, although exceedingly rare, also occurs.

The emergence of transcatheter aortic valve intervention as a ther-
apeutic  option  for  patients  with  severe  aortic  stenosis  who  are  not 
optimal  candidates  for  surgical  replacement  has  resulted  in  a  very 
important clinical role for multimodality imaging. Imaging plays a crit-
ical role in preprocedural planning, intraprocedural implantation opti-
mization, and follow-up of these patients. CT plays an important role 
in defining the eligibility of the proposed access site (CTA of the aorta 

and iliac arteries) and in defining the anatomic relationships between 
the aortic valve and aortic root, left ventricle, and coronary ostia. Car-
diac CT and transesophageal echocardiography are also used to define 
the device size. Transesophageal echocardiography is used during the 
device  implantation  to  ensure  the  best  prosthesis–patient  match,  to 
assess prosthesis position and function after deployment, and to iden-
tify  immediate  complications  (e.g.,  aortic  insufficiency,  paravalvular 
leak resulting from patient–prosthesis mismatch). Echocardiography is 
the imaging modality of choice for long-term surveillance.

Assessment  of  Aortic  Regurgitation  Assessment  of  aortic 
regurgitation requires qualitative assessment of the aortic valve struc-
ture. Aortic regurgitation is common with congenital abnormalities of 
the aortic valve, the most common of which is bicuspid aortic valve. 
Aortic  regurgitation  often  coexists  with  aortic  stenosis,  and  it  is  not 
uncommon for patients to have both severe aortic stenosis and regurgi-
tation. Congenital abnormalities of the aortic leaflets, such as bicuspid 
aortic  valve,  are  common  causes  of  aortic  insufficiency.  Dilatation 
of  the  aortic  root,  as  occurs  in  patients  with  hypertension  and  other 
disorders in which aortic dilatation can occur, can also lead to aortic 
regurgitation even when the valve leaflets are intrinsically normal due 
to  malcoaptation  of  the  leaflets.  Aortic  root  dilatation  is  common  in 
patients with aortic regurgitation, both as a cause or coexisting lesion, 
and the aortic root and ascending aorta should be measured and fol-
lowed in these patients (Fig. 241-20).

Because aortic regurgitation can result in dilatation of the left ven-
tricle over time with ultimate reduction in ventricular function, caring 
for  the patient with  aortic  regurgitation  requires  serial  assessment  of 
ventricular size and function. Patients whose ventricles dilate beyond 
an  end-systolic  diameter  of  5.5  cm  or  whose  LVEF  declines  below 
normal  are  at  significantly  higher  risk  of  death  or  heart  failure,  and 
these  measures  are  often  used  to  decide  the  need  for  valve  surgery. 
Quantitation of regurgitation itself can be performed using a number 
of methods. Semiquantitative visual assessment of aortic regurgitant jet 
width and depth by color flow Doppler remains the most used. The jet 
diameter as a ratio of the left ventricular outflow tract diameter prox-
imal to the valve represents one of the most reliable indices of severity

estimation  of  color  flow  Doppler  is  generally 
sufficient  for  qualitative  assessment  of  regur-
gitant  severity  but  can  dramatically  under-  or 
overestimate regurgitation severity, particularly 
when  regurgitant  jets  are  quite  eccentric.  For 
this  reason,  quantitative  assessment  is  gener-
ally  recommended,  especially  when  making 
clinical  decisions  about  surgical  intervention. 
The  proximal  isovelocity  surface  area  (PISA) 
method  is  generally  used  for  quantitative 
assessment  of  severity  of  mitral  regurgitation.  This  method  relies  on 
estimation  of  the  velocity  of  flow  acceleration  at  a  specific  distance 
proximal to the valve with the assumption that the flow accelerates in 
concentric hemispheres.

As  with  aortic  insufficiency,  assessment  of  ventricular  structure 
and function is also integral in the evaluation of mitral regurgitation. 
Although  some  patients  have  mitral  regurgitation  due  to  intrinsic 
abnormalities of the valve itself, in others, the valve can be relatively 
normal but the mitral regurgitation can be secondary to dilatation and 
remodeling  of  the  left  ventricle.  So-called  functional  mitral  regurgi-
tation  is  generally  secondary  to  apical  displacement  of  the  papillary 
muscles in a dilated ventricle, resulting in the leaflets of the mitral valve 
being pulled toward the apex of the heart, resulting in poor coaptation 
during systole and resultant relatively central mitral regurgitation. This 
type of mitral regurgitation can generally be distinguished from intrin-
sic  mitral  valve  disease,  and  the  surgical  or  procedural  treatment  of 
these conditions can be different. Knowledge of the etiology of mitral 
regurgitation  can  be  important  for  a  surgeon  planning  mitral  valve 
surgery. Moreover, new procedural approaches to mitral valve disease 
may be different depending on the etiology.

Ventricular  dilatation  is  an  important  predictor  of  outcome  in 
patients with mitral regurgitation of any cause. It is important to realize 
that in a patient with significant mitral regurgitation, a large portion 
of  the  blood  being  ejected  from  the  left  ventricle  with  every  beat  is 
regurgitant, thus artificially increasing the ejection fraction. Thus, an 
ejection fraction of 55% in a patient with severe mitral regurgitation 
may  actually  represent  substantial  reduction  in  myocardial  systolic 
function.

CMR can be helpful in evaluating mitral regurgitation in a subset of 
patients when echocardiographic assessment is inadequate. CMR can 
directly  quantify  regurgitant  volume  of  the  mitral  regurgitant  jet  or 
indirectly quantify regurgitant volume by measuring the difference of 
left ventricular stroke volume and aortic forward flow.

Assessment of Mitral Stenosis  Rheumatic mitral disease remains 
the most common cause of mitral stenosis, although mitral stenosis can 
also  result  from  severe  calcification  of  the  mitral  leaflets.  Rheumatic 
mitral stenosis has a distinct appearance characterized by tethering at 
the leaflet tips and relative pliability of the leaflets themselves, resulting 
in a hockey stick–type deformation particularly of the anterior leaflet 
(Fig. 241-24). Narrowing of the mitral orifice impedes flow from the 
left atrium to the left ventricle, resulting in increased pressures in the 
left atrium, which are then transmitted backward into the pulmonary 
vasculature  and  the  right  side  of  the  heart.  When  mitral  stenosis  is 
suspected,  echocardiography  can  be  useful  for  determining  etiology 
(specifically whether it is rheumatic or not), estimating the valve areas 
and gradients across the valve, assessing the left atrium, and assessing 
right  ventricular  size  and  function.  Assessment  of  left  atrial  size  and 
right  ventricular  size  and  function  is  particularly  useful  in  helping 
determine the severity of the mitral stenosis.
 ■ MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND HEART FAILURE
Role  of  Imaging  after  Myocardial  Infarction 
Imaging  can 
be  useful  in  the  immediate  and  long-term  follow-up  of  patients 
with  myocardial  infarction.  As  discussed  earlier  in  the  chapter,  LGE 

and correlates well with angiographic assessment. Similarly, the vena 
contracta,  which  represents  the  smallest  diameter  of  the  regurgitant 
flow at the level of the valve, can be used to assess the severity of aortic 
regurgitation.  Other  Doppler-based  methods  include  assessing  the 
pressure half-time, or rate of decline of the pressure gradient between 
the  aorta  and  left  ventricle,  a  measure  of  acuity  of  aortic  regurgita-
tion,  and  assessing  aortic  flow  reversal  in  the  descending  aorta.  The 
regurgitant volume can be calculated by comparing the flow across the 
aortic and pulmonic valves, assuming the pulmonic valve is competent. 
Central or perivalvular aortic regurgitation is common in patients fol-
lowing TAVR and is generally assessed immediately after the procedure 
and on follow-up echocardiography.

CMR  offers  several  advantages  over  echocardiography  in  the 
assessment  of  aortic  regurgitation.  CMR  is  more  accurate  than 
echocardiography for assessing small changes in cardiac size or func-
tion  longitudinally  in  patients  with  aortic  insufficiency.  In  addition, 
CMR can accurately quantify aortic regurgitant volume secondary to 
aortic insufficiency better than echocardiography. CMR can also cap-
ture aortic size in 3D that may be helpful in determining the etiology of 
the aortic regurgitation or in monitoring progression of the condition  
(Fig. 241-21 and Video 241-6).

Assessment  of  Mitral  Regurgitation  The  normal  mitral  valve 
consists of an anterior and posterior leaflet in a saddle shape configu-
ration (Fig. 241-22). The leaflets are attached to the papillary muscles 
via chordae tendineae that insert on the ventricular side of the leaflets. 
Mitral  regurgitation  can  occur  due  to  abnormalities  of  the  leaflets, 
the  chordal  structures,  or  the  ventricle,  or  any  combination  of  these  
(Fig. 241-23).

Mitral valve prolapse, in which one leaflet moves behind the plane of 
the other leaflet, can be due to myxomatous degeneration of the valves 
and  leaflet  redundancy,  disruption  of  chordal  structures  secondary 
to  degenerative  disease,  or  papillary  muscle  rupture  or  dysfunction 
following  myocardial  infarction.  Regurgitant  jets  can  be  visualized 
using  color  flow  Doppler.  The  velocity  of  regurgitant  jets  is  driven 
by  the  pressure  gradient  between  the  two  chambers.  This  velocity

Echocardiography is the best method for assessment of patients with 
suspected mechanical complications after myocardial infarction. These 
include mitral regurgitation secondary to either papillary muscle dys-
function or rupture of papillary muscle head, ventricular septal defect, 
or  even  cardiac  rupture.  A  new  severe  systolic  murmur  should  raise 
suspicions  for  either  severe  mitral  regurgitation  or  ventricular  septal 
defect. While cardiac rupture is often catastrophic, contained ruptures, 
also  known  as  pseudoaneurysms,  can  occur,  and  early  diagnosis  and 
surgical treatment are the best way to maximize survival. The presence 
of thrombus within the pericardial space following myocardial infarc-
tion  should  immediately  raise  suspicion  of  myocardial  rupture  and 
represents a surgical emergency.

Some  patients  demonstrate  progressive  left  ventricular  dilatation 
and dysfunction, known as cardiac remodeling, after myocardial infarc-
tion. Assessment of cardiac function and regional wall motion is useful 
in the follow-up period, generally between 1 and 6 months following 
infarction. The persistence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction fol-
lowing infarction is used to determine the type of therapy (e.g., angi-
otensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers 
are typically used in patients with systolic dysfunction following myo-
cardial infarction).

In patients with acute or subacute myocardial infarction, investiga-
tion of residual ischemia and/or viability is occasionally an important 
clinical question, especially among those with recurrent symptoms after 
myocardial  infarction  (Fig.  241-27).  All  cardiac  imaging  techniques 
can provide information regarding myocardial viability and ischemia. 
The available data suggest that radionuclide imaging, especially PET, is 
highly sensitive, with higher negative predictive value than dobutamine 
echocardiography. In contrast, dobutamine echocardiography tends to 
be associated with higher specificity and positive predictive accuracy 
than  the  radionuclide  imaging  methods.  The  experience  with  CMR 
suggests that it offers similar predictive accuracies as those seen with 
dobutamine echocardiography.

Role of Imaging in New-Onset Heart Failure  Echocardiography 
is usually a first-line test in patients presenting with new-onset heart 
failure.  As  discussed  above,  this  test  provides  a  direct  assessment  of 
ventricular  function  and  can  help  distinguish  patients  with  reduced 
from  those  with  preserved  ejection  fraction.  In  addition,  it  provides 
additional  structural  information  including  an  assessment  of  valves, 
myocardium, and pericardium.

Although coronary angiography is commonly performed in patients 
with  reduced  ejection  fraction,  the  determination  of  heart  failure 
etiology in an individual patient may be difficult even if angiograph-
ically  obstructive  CAD  is  present.  Indeed,  patients  with  heart  failure 
and  no  angiographic  CAD  may  have  typical  angina  or  regional  wall 
motion abnormalities on noninvasive imaging, whereas patients with 
angiographically  obstructive  CAD  may  have  no  symptoms  of  angina 
or  history  of  myocardial  infarction.  Thus,  the  appropriate  classifica-
tion for any given patient is not always clear, and it often requires the 
complementary information of coronary angiography and noninvasive 
imaging. As discussed above, stress radionuclide imaging and echoc-
ardiography  can  be  helpful  in  delineating  the  extent  and  severity  of 
inducible  myocardial  ischemia  and  viability.  Multiparametric  CMR 
can be quite helpful in the differential diagnosis of heart failure etiol-
ogies.  Apart  from  quantifying  left  and  right  ventricular  volumes  and 
function,  CMR  can  provide  information  about  myocardial  ischemia 
and  scar.  The  pattern  of  LGE  helps  differentiate  infarction  (typically 
starting  in  the  subendocardium  and  involving  a  coronary  territory) 
from  other  forms  of  infiltrative  or  inflammatory  cardiomyopathies 
(typically involving the mid- or subepicardial layers without following 
a  coronary  distribution)  (Fig.  241-28).  In  addition,  it  can  assess  the 
presence of myocardial edema using T1 or T2 tissue mapping methods 
to provide information about the chronicity of ACSs or noncoronary 
inflammatory  conditions  (e.g.,  myocarditis).  Other  methods  such  as 
T2*  mapping  of  myocardial  iron  deposition  assess  the  extent  of  iron 
infiltration that can lead to cardiac toxicity. Infiltrative cardiomyopathy 
such as amyloidosis typically has a restrictive cardiomyopathy pattern 
characterized  by  biventricular  increased  wall  thickness  and  bilateral 

FIGURE  241-25  Example  of  a  patient  who  presented  with  inferior  ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction (MI) after several days of intermittent chest pain. 
The MRI confirmed an inferior MI by the location of late gadolinium enhancement 
(LGE; red arrows). In addition, there is a central area of microvascular obstruction 
(dark region surrounded by the bright LGE, white arrow). LV, left ventricle; RV, right 
ventricle.

imaging by CMR is the best technique for imaging for presence or the 
extent  of  infarcted  myocardium.  In  a  recent  multicenter  study,  LGE 
imaging identified infarct location accurately and detected acute and 
chronic infarcts at a sensitivity of 99 and 94%, respectively. In addition, 
regions of microvascular obstruction (no-reflow) can be seen as dense 
hypoenhanced  areas  within  the  core  of  a  bright  region  of  infarction  
(Fig. 241-25). Both the presence of LGE and microvascular obstruc-
tion are markers of increased clinical risk.

While  echocardiography  is  often  used  to  assess  myocardial  func-
tion  immediately  after  myocardial  infarction,  myocardial  stunning  is 
common  in  the  early  post–myocardial  infarction  period,  especially 
in patients who undergo reperfusion therapy. In these patients, either 
partial or complete recovery of ventricular function is common within 
several days, so that early estimation of ejection fraction may be mis-
leading. In patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction, imag-
ing can generally be deferred for several days so that a more accurate 
assessment of cardiac function, including regional wall motion, can be 
assessed (Fig. 241-26).

different patients with coronary artery disease. The top panel demonstrates extensive late gadolinium enhancement (bright white areas) involving the anterior, anteroseptal, 
and apical left ventricular walls (arrows), consistent with myocardial scar and nonviable myocardium. The lower left panel demonstrates rubidium-82 myocardial perfusion 
and  18F-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG)  images  showing  a  large  and  severe  perfusion  defect  in  the  anterior,  anterolateral,  and  apical  walls,  indicating  preserved  glucose 
metabolism (so-called perfusion-metabolic mismatch) consistent with viable myocardium. The  right lower panel shows similar PET images demonstrating concordant 
reduction in perfusion and metabolism (so-called perfusion-metabolic match) in the lateral wall, consistent with nonviable myocardium.

atrial  enlargement,  as  assessed  by  both  echocardiography  and  CMR. 
CMR  of  patients  with  cardiac  amyloidosis  often  also  demonstrates  a 
characteristic pattern of diffuse endocardial infiltration of the left ven-
tricle and the atria (Fig. 241-28). On strain echocardiography, patients 
with cardiac amyloidosis show a reduction in systolic function, which 
typically spares the apical left ventricular segments. Bone scintigraphy 
complements the use of echocardiography and CMR in cardiac amy-
loidosis by allowing accurate noninvasive distinction of transthyretin 
(ATTR)  from  light  chain  (AL)  cardiac  amyloidosis:  ATTR  typically 
shows intense 99mTc tracer uptake compared to patients with AL amy-
loidosis  (Fig.  241-29).  Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  has  variable 
degree  of  increased  ventricular  thickness  and  often  is  seen  to  have 
outflow obstruction and intense LGE in regions with marked hypertro-
phy (Fig. 241-30). CMR also can quantify myocardial iron content in 
patients at risk of iron-overload cardiomyopathy (Video 241-7).

PET metabolic imaging has a complementary role in the evaluation 
of  inflammatory  cardiomyopathies,  especially  sarcoidosis  where  the 
presence of focal and/or diffuse glucose uptake can help identify areas 
of  active  inflammation.  In  addition,  for  patients  undergoing  immu-
nosuppressive therapy, PET is frequently used to monitor therapeutic 
response  (Fig.  241-31).  In  patients  with  ischemic  cardiomyopathy, 
radionuclide imaging in general and PET in particular are frequently 
used to quantify the presence and extent of myocardial ischemia and 
viability to assist with clinical decision making related to myocardial 
revascularization (Fig. 241-26).
 ■ ASSESSING CARDIAC FUNCTION IN PATIENTS 
UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT
Therapies used to treat cancer can adversely affect the cardiovascular 
system. As the efficacy of cancer treatment and survival improve, many 
patients  are  presenting  with  late  adverse  consequences  from  chemo-
therapy  and/or  radiation  therapy  on  cardiovascular  function.  Thus, 
the  morbidity  and  mortality  from  late  cardiovascular  complications 

threaten to offset the early gains in cancer survival, especially among 
children and young adults. Early recognition and treatment of cardio-
myocyte  injury  are  critical  for  successful  application  of  preventative 
therapies but difficult because the adverse effects on cardiac function 
are a relatively late manifestation after exposure to anticancer therapy.
The  accepted  standard  for  clinical  diagnosis  of  cardiotoxicity  is 
defined as a >5% reduction in LVEF to <55% with symptoms of heart 
failure, or a >10% drop in LVEF to <55% in patients who are asymp-
tomatic. Thus, noninvasive imaging plays a major role in diagnosing 
and  monitoring  for  cardiac  toxicity  in  patients  undergoing  cancer 
treatment. Radionuclide angiography has been the technique of choice 
for  quite  some  time.  However,  echocardiography  now  plays  a  major 
role in this application.

Recently,  more  novel  imaging  approaches  have  been  advocated, 
including  deformation  imaging  with  echocardiography  and  fibrosis 
imaging with CMR. These techniques have shown promising results in 
experimental animal models and in humans. In addition, there are also 
proof-of-concept  studies  in  animal  models  using  molecular  imaging 
approaches targeting the mechanisms of cardiac toxicity (e.g., apopto-
sis and oxidant stress), which can presumably provide the earliest signs 
of the off-target effects of these therapies. However, these techniques 
are currently considered experimental.
 ■ PERICARDIAL DISEASE
The  fibroelastic  pericardial  sac  surrounding  the  heart  consists  of  a 
visceral, or epicardial, layer and a parietal layer, with a generally small 
amount  of  pericardial  fluid  in  between  layers.  The  pericardium  is 
generally  quite  pliable  and  moves  easily  with  the  heart  during  con-
traction  and  relaxation.  Abnormalities  of  the  pericardium  can  affect 
cardiac  function  primarily  by  impairing  the  heart’s  ability  to  fill. 
Inflammation of the pericardium can lead to an accumulation of fluid 
between the two layers, or pericardial effusion, which can be visualized 
by  echocardiography,  CMR,  or  CT.  Other  reasons  for  accumulation

FIGURE  241-30  This  figure  demonstrates  three  pulse  sequence  techniques  by  cardiac  magnetic  resonance  that  are  often  used  to  assess  patients  with  hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, all displayed in the mid short-axis scan plane. The center panel demonstrates that the left ventricle (LV) was markedly thickened in its wall thickness 
especially in the LV septum (red arrows). This finding was matched by marked regions of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), which was consistent with fibrosis in these 
segments (right panel, white arrows). The left panel was cine myocardial tagging in the same slice plane. Myocardial tagging is used to assess the normal intramyocardial 
strain by assessing distortion of the myocardial grids during systole. In this case, despite normal-appearing systolic radial wall thickening, the myocardial strain as assessed 
by the distortion of grids was markedly reduced (left panel, white arrows). This finding is consistent with substantial myofibril disarray in the anterior and anteroseptal 
segments in this patient. RV, right ventricle.

of  pericardial  fluid  include  infection,  malignancy,  and  bleeding  into 
the pericardium. The latter can be the result of catastrophic processes 
such as trauma, cardiac rupture, perforation in the setting of a cardiac 
procedure, cardiac surgery, or dissection of the aorta with extension in 
the pericardium.

Echocardiography  remains  the  initial  test  of  choice  for  assessing 
pericardial  disease,  especially  effusions  (Fig.  241-32).  Moreover, 
echocardiography can be useful in evaluating for pericardial constric-
tive  physiology,  in  which  a  thick  noncompliant  pericardium  impairs 
cardiac  filling.  The  location,  size,  and  physiologic  consequences  of 
accumulated  pericardial  effusion  can  generally  easily  be  determined 

by  echocardiography.  Pericardial  tamponade  occurs  when  enough 
pericardial  fluid  accumulates  so  that  the  intrapericardial  pressure 
exceeds filling pressures of the heart, generally the right ventricle. The 
balance  between  intrapericardial  pressure  and  ventricular  pressure  is 
more important than the extent of fluid accumulation. Conditions in 
which pericardial effusions accumulate over a long period of time, as 
can be the case in the setting of malignant effusions, can lead to large 
pericardial  fluid  accumulations  without  the  classic  hemodynamic 
findings  associated  with  pericardial  tamponade.  In  contrast,  rapid 
accumulations of pericardial fluid, such as those that occur due to car-
diac rupture or perforation, can lead to tamponade physiology without

FIGURE 241-31  Representative cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR; top panel) and positron emission tomography (PET; lower panel) images from a 45-year-old male 
presenting  with  complete  heart  block.  The  CMR  images  demonstrate  extensive  late  gadolinium  enhancement  in  the  subepicardial  left  ventricular  (LV)  anterior  and 
anteroseptal walls and also in the right ventricular (RV) free wall (arrows). The PET images demonstrate extensive fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the same areas, most 
consistent with active inflammation due to sarcoidosis.

very large effusions. In patients with suspected pericardial effusion or 
tamponade, echocardiography can usually be performed rapidly, at the 
bedside,  and  even  by  operators  with  limited  skill.  The  distance  from 
the parietal to the visceral pericardial layer can be measured, and when 
this exceeds ~1 cm, an effusion is considered significant. Echocardio-
graphic features suggestive of tamponade include diastolic collapse of 
the right ventricular free wall, suggestive of pericardial pressures that 
exceed  right  ventricular  filling  pressures,  and  Doppler  evidence  of 
respiratory  flow  variation,  which  is  the  Doppler  equivalent  of  pulsus 
paradoxus.  Despite  the  benefits  of  echocardiography  in  suspected 
pericardial tamponade, the diagnosis of tamponade remains a clinical 
diagnosis, and other important features, such as patient’s blood pres-
sure in the presence of pulsus paradoxus, need to be taken into account 
when considering therapeutic options.

Chronic inflammation of the pericardium leads to thickening and 
calcification of the parietal pericardium, resulting in pericardial con-
striction  in  which  diastolic  filling  can  be  severely  impaired.  In  these 
cases, filling of the ventricles comes to an abrupt halt when the volume 
of  ventricular  filling  is  impaired  by  the  constricting  pericardium. 
Assessment of pericardial thickness in these patients is important, but 
it is just as important to note that approximately one in five patients 
with  severe  pericardial  constriction  have  no  significant  pericardial 
thickening by imaging or at surgery. Thus, a lack of thickened pericar-
dium does not rule out pericardial constriction, and patients’ signs and 
symptomatology  and  physiologic  evidence  of  constriction  should  be 
assessed independently. Pericardial constriction typically demonstrates 
marked respiratory changes in diastolic flow on Doppler echocardiog-
raphy, in contrast to restrictive cardiomyopathy, but substantial overlap 
exists.  CT  and  CMR  offer  tomographic,  whole-heart  assessment  of 
pericardial thickening and other anatomy abnormalities in pericardial 
constriction, such as enlarged atria, vena cavas, and pleural and pericar-
dial effusions (Figs. 241-33 and 241-34 and Videos 241-8 and 241-9). 
CMR  offers  the  additional  information  of  pericardial  fibrosis  and 
inflammation by LGE imaging and evidence of constrictive physiology 
(e.g.,  regional  relaxation  concordance  due  to  myocardial  adhesions, 
abnormal septal bounce with Valsalva maneuver) (Fig. 241-34).
 ■ CARDIAC THROMBUS AND MASS
Echocardiography  is  usually  the  modality  that  first  detects  a  cardiac 
mass  with  differential  diagnoses  including  thrombus,  tumor,  or  veg-
etation.  Given  their  unrestricted  tomographic  views  and  multiplanar 
three-dimensional  imaging,  CMR  and  CT  can  complement  echocar-
diography by further characterizing the physical features of the cardiac 
mass. Compared to CT, CMR has the advantage of higher tissue con-
trast differentiation, more robust cine imaging, and the use of multi-
faceted techniques within the same imaging session to determine the 
physiologic characteristics of the mass. Gadolinium contrast enhance-
ment  patterns  of  increased  capillary  perfusion  can  detect  vascularity 
within a mass, which differentiates a tumor from a thrombus. Struc-
tures  that  are  known  to  mimic  a  cardiac  mass  include  (1)  anatomic 

FIGURE  241-33  A  female  patient  developed  pericardial  constriction  and  right 
heart failure, secondary to radiation therapy for breast cancer. Note the multiple

variants, such as the Eustachian valve, Chiari network, crista sagittalis 
or terminalis, and the right ventricular moderator band, and (2) “pseu-
dotumors,”  such  as  interatrial  septal  aneurysm,  coronary  or  aortic 
aneurysm, lipomatous hypertrophy of interatrial septum, hiatal hernia, 
or a catheter/pacemaker lead. Coexisting abnormalities that raise the 
likelihood  of  a  cardiac  thrombus  (Fig.  241-35)  include  regional  wall 
motion abnormality from an infarction or ventricular aneurysm, atrial 
fibrillation  leading  to  slow  flow  in  the  left  atrial  appendage,  or  pres-
ence of venous catheters or recent endovascular injury. CMR has the 
advantage of being able to assess regional wall motion and infarction or 
ventricular aneurysm in matching scan planes, adjacent to the cardiac 
thrombus,  using  cine  and  LGE  imaging,  respectively.  For  ventricular 
thrombus, gadolinium-enhanced LGE imaging can detect thrombus at 
a higher sensitivity than echocardiography by depicting high-contrast 
difference between the dark thrombus and its adjacent structures and 
by imaging in three dimensions. In addition, mural thrombus does not 
enhance on first-pass perfusion and often has a characteristic “etched” 
appearance  (black  border  surrounding  a  bright  center)  on  LGE 
imaging,  thus  providing  higher  diagnostic  specificity  than  anatomic 
information  alone  (Fig.  241-36).  Comparing  the  signal  intensities  of 
a  mass  before  and  after  contrast  injection  may  confirm  the  lack  of 
tissue  vascularity  (i.e.,  thrombus)  by  the  lack  of  signal  enhancement 
after  contrast  administration.  Like  intracardiac  thrombus,  regions 
of  microvascular  obstruction  also  appear  dark,  but  microvascular 
obstruction  is  confined  within  the  myocardium  and  surrounded  by 
infarction and thus can be differentiated from intracardiac thrombus. 
Cardiac  CT  imaging  is  ideally  suited  for  small  thrombus  in  the  left 
atrial  appendage,  especially  in  cases  where  transesophageal  echocar-
diography is suboptimal or not feasible.

The  majority  of  cardiac  malignancy  is  metastatic,  which  is  about 
twentyfold more common than primary cardiac malignancies. Metasta-
sis to the heart can be the result of direct invasion (e.g., lung and breast), 
lymphatic spread (e.g., lymphomas and melanomas), or hematogenous 
spread (e.g., renal cell carcinoma). Primary benign cardiac tumors are 
seen mostly in children and young adults and include atrial myxoma, 
rhabdomyoma, fibroma, and endocardial fibroelastoma (Fig. 241-37). 
Atrial  myxomas  are  often  seen  as  a  round  or  multilobar  mass  in  the 
left atrium (75%), right atrium (20%), or ventricles or mixed chambers 
(5%).  They  typically  have  inhomogeneous  brightness  in  the  center 
on  cine  steady-state  free  precession  imaging  due  to  their  gelatinous

Primary malignant cardiac tumors are rare and may include angiosar-
coma, fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and liposarcoma.

 ■ ROLE OF IMAGING IN INFECTIOUS AND 
INFLAMMATORY DISEASE
Patients with suspected endocarditis often undergo echocardiography 
for the purpose of identifying vegetations or intramyocardial abscesses. 
Vegetations are generally highly mobile structures that most typically 
are  attached  to  valves  or  present  in  areas  of  the  heart  with  turbulent 

flow. The absence of a vegetation on echocardiography does not rule 
out endocarditis, because small vegetations below the resolution of the 
imaging techniques can be present. Echocardiography remains the best 
technique for assessment of vegetations because its high temporal res-
olution allows visualization of the typical oscillating motion, although 
large vegetations can be visualized with other techniques (Fig. 241-38). 
The  size  and  location  of  a  vegetation  do  not  necessarily  provide  any 
specific  information  about  the  type  of  infection.  Abscesses,  particu-
larly around the aortic and mitral annuli, are particularly concerning 
in  patients  with  endocarditis  and  should  be  suspected  in  patients

with  prolongation  of  cardiac  intervals  in  the  setting  of  endocarditis. 
Visualization  of  both  vegetations  and  possible  abscesses  is  best  done 
with  transesophageal  echocardiography,  particularly  in  patients  with 
prosthetic valves. Indeed, transesophageal echocardiography is the first 
test of choice in a patient with a mechanical mitral or aortic valve and 
suspected endocarditis (Fig. 241-38). Vegetations should be measured 
because their size has prognostic importance and can be used to decide 
whether a patient should be taken to surgery.

PET metabolic imaging is emerging as a potentially useful imaging 
technique to identify the source of infection in patients with prosthetic 
valves,  vascular  grafts,  and  implantable  pacemakers/defibrillators, 
especially in patients in whom echocardiography and/or blood cultures 
are negative. There is an emerging literature documenting the potential 
value  of  macrophage-targeted  metabolic  imaging  with  18F-FDG  and 
PET (Fig. 241-39). Likewise, FDG PET is also useful to identify vas-
cular inflammation and monitor the response to immunosuppressive 
therapy (Fig. 241-40).

 ■ EVALUATION OF COMMON CONGENITAL 
ABNORMALITIES IN THE ADULT
While a discussion of complex congenital heart disease is beyond the 
scope  of  this  chapter,  several  common  congenital  abnormalities  are 
present  in  adults,  and  cardiac  imaging  is  essential  to  diagnosing  and 
managing  these  conditions.  Abnormalities  of  the  interatrial  septum 
probably represent the most common adult congenital cardiac abnor-
malities. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) can be identified in almost 25% 
of patients. In patients with PFO, a one-way flap in the region of the 
fossa  ovalis  is  normally  kept  closed  by  the  left  atrial  pressure,  which 
is  generally  higher  than  right  atrial  pressure  for  much  of  the  cardiac 
cycle. However, right-to-left flow through a PFO can occur any time 
the right atrial pressure exceeds the left atrial pressure, including with 
maneuvers or conditions in which intrathoracic pressure is increased. 
The  presence  of  a  PFO  can  increase  the  likelihood  of  the  paradoxi-
cal  embolus,  and  thus  the  presence  of  a  PFO  should  be  determined 
in  patients  with  stroke  or  systemic  embolus  of  unknown  etiology. 
Because  the  one-way  flap  of  the  PFO  will  be  closed  during  much  of 
the  cardiac  cycle,  color  flow  Doppler  will  usually  not  reveal  a  PFO. 
Instead, agitated saline (bubble study) is the best way to assess for PFO 
or atrial septal defect. Saline is agitated and injected peripherally and 
then enters the right atrium. If no shunt is present, only the right side 
of the heart will be pacified because the air bubbles will be too small to 
traverse the lungs. Because PFO is a one-way flap, maneuvers should 
be used to temporarily increase right atrial pressure. Either a Valsalva 
maneuver or sniff maneuver can be effective.

cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the large myocardial mass involving the anterolateral wall. Shortly after gadolinium contrast was injected, the myocardial 
mass demonstrated intense accumulation of contrast on late gadolinium enhancement imaging (right panel, asterisk). This is a case of cardiac fibroma. The patient also has 
gingival hyperplasia and bifid thoracic ribs, a part of the rare Gorlin’s syndrome.

FIGURE 241-42  A and B are phase contrast images that display blood flow (phase images on A) and anatomy (structural images on B) of the aorta (red) and pulmonary 
artery (green). C demonstrates the flow curves of the aorta (red) and the pulmonary artery (green). Note that the total flow (area under the curve) was substantially higher 
in the pulmonary artery than the aorta, indicative of a marked elevated pulmonary-to-systemic shunt ratio, as a result of the partial anomalous pulmonary venous return that 
drained into the superior vena cava.

Atrial septal defects occur most commonly in the region of the fossa 
ovalis, referred to as secundum-type defects (Fig. 241-41). Additional 
atrial  septal  defects  include  defects  of  the  sinus  venosus  and  atrium 
primum. Color flow Doppler echocardiography is usually sufficient for 
diagnosis of a secundum-type atrial septal defect, but agitated saline is 
generally needed for the diagnosis of other types of atrial septal defects.
Ventricular septal defects can generally be visualized by color flow 
Doppler as turbulent high-velocity jets from the left to the right ventri-
cle. In cases where the jet origin is unclear, continuous wave Doppler 
can estimate the velocities. These would be expected to be extremely 
high to reflect the pressure gradient between the left and right ventri-
cles. Defects can occur in both the muscular and membranous portions 
of the ventricular septum.

In  patients  with  either  atrial  or  ventricular  septal  defects,  estima-
tion of the severity of the left-to-right shunt is essential and can be an 
important determinant in management decisions. Shunts are generally 
assessed  by  echocardiography  by  assessing  the  relationship  between 
pulmonary flow and aortic flow, the Qp/Qs ratio. Shunts and cardiac 
anatomy of most congenital heart diseases can also be accurately eval-
uated by CMR (Fig. 241-42).

patient in the long-axis four-chamber view. Note that the basal aspect of the right 
ventricular (RV) free wall is thickened, aneurysmal, and akinetic (red arrows). The 
global RV systolic function is mildly reduced, and the RV is dilated. CMR can image 
the  RV  using  tomographic  views  and  can  quantify  the  RV  volumes  and  ejection 
fraction  volumetrically.  This  is  a  patient  who  presented  with  syncopal  spells  and 
inducible ventricular tachycardia on subsequent workup. He was diagnosed to have 
arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.

VIDEO  241-4  The  video  shows  cardiac  magnetic  resonance  (CMR)  myocardial 
perfusion imaging during vasodilating stress, in three parallel short-axis views. 
A  bolus  of  gadolinium  contrast  was  injected  intravenously  while  rapid  imaging 
acquisition occurred. The contrast enhances the right ventricle first, then travels 
through the pulmonary circulation, enters the left ventricle (LV), and then perfuses 
the  LV  myocardium.  Myocardial  perfusion  defects  with  this  technique  show  as 
black subendocardial rims, reflecting lack of contrast accumulation due to ischemia 
and/or scar. In this case, the anterior wall has a severe perfusion defect (red arrow). 
Figure 241-14 shows the late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image of a mid short-
axis view. There is no evidence of infarction in the anterior wall, which would be 
seen  as  bright  white  areas,  indicating  that  the  stress  perfusion  defect  primarily 
represents myocardial ischemia. This patient had a significant stenosis of the left 
anterior descending coronary artery.

VIDEO  241-5  A  60-year-old  female  presented  with  intermittent  chest  pain  of  
3 days in duration but was pain-free at the time of assessment in the emergency 
department.  Admission  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  demonstrated  T-wave  inversion 
in  the  anterior  precordial  lead,  but  cardiac  enzymes  were  normal.  A  resting 
cardiac  magnetic  resonance  (CMR)  study  reviewed  a  large  area  of  anteroseptal 
hypokinesia (left picture, region of hypokinesia shown by the red arrows), matching 
with a large resting perfusion defect (middle picture, perfusion defect shown by the 
blue arrows). Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging (right picture), however, 
did not show any enhancement to indicate any infarction in the anteroseptal wall, 
suggesting that the hypocontractile and hypoperfused anteroseptal wall was viable. 
Urgent  coronary  angiography  demonstrated  an  acute  thrombus  in  the  mid  left 
anterior descending coronary artery, which required coronary stenting. This case 
represents  an  example  of  acute  coronary  syndrome  with  hibernating  but  viable 
myocardium in the anteroseptal wall. The anteroseptal wall recovered contractile 
function when reassessed 6 months later.

magnetic  resonance  (CMR).  Notice  the  dark  flow  jet  during  diastolic  across  the 
aortic valve. For quantitation of the aortic regurgitation severity, a cross-sectional 
cut was made just below the aortic valve, perpendicular to the aortic regurgitation 
jet, using phase contrast flow imaging. Apart from aortic regurgitation fraction and 
volume, CMR also can volumetrically quantify ventricular sizes and dimensions of 
the aorta, which are useful in monitoring patients with aortic valve diseases.

markedly darkened in these movies, indicating high load of iron in the heart muscle 
and  liver.  The  rate  of  signal  reduction  (decay)  in  the  myocardium  and  liver  can 
be calculated as T2* value expressed in milliseconds. In this case, the T2* was at  
10 ms. T2* <20 ms in patients with cardiomyopathy has been shown to indicate iron 
toxicity as the etiology of the cardiomyopathy, and it carries prognostic value for 
such patients at risk of cardiac iron toxicity.

242 Diagnostic Cardiac 
Catheterization and  
Coronary Angiography
Jane A. Leopold, David P. Faxon

Diagnostic  cardiac  catheterization  and  coronary  angiography  are 
considered  the  gold  standard  in  the  assessment  of  the  anatomy  and 
physiology of the heart and its associated vasculature. In 1929, Forss-
mann demonstrated the feasibility of cardiac catheterization in humans 
when  he  passed  a  urological  catheter  from  a  vein  in  his  arm  to  his 
right  atrium  and  documented  the  catheter’s  position  in  the  heart  by 
x-ray.  In  the  1940s,  Cournand  and  Richards  applied  this  technique 
to  patients  with  cardiovascular  disease  to  evaluate  cardiac  function. 
These three physicians were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1956. In 1958, 
Sones  inadvertently  performed  the  first  selective  coronary  angiogra-
phy when a catheter in the left ventricle slipped back across the aortic 
valve, engaged the right coronary artery, and power-injected 40 mL of 
contrast  down  the  vessel.  The  resulting  angiogram  provided  superb 
anatomic  detail  of  the  artery,  and  the  patient  suffered  no  adverse 
effects. Sones went on to develop selective coronary catheters, which 
were modified further by Judkins, who developed preformed catheters 
and  allowed  coronary  artery  angiography  to  gain  widespread  use  as 
a  diagnostic  tool.  In  the  United  States,  cardiac  catheterization  is  the 
second most common operative procedure, with more than 1.0 million 
procedures performed annually.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
 ■ INDICATIONS, RISKS, AND PREPROCEDURE 
MANAGEMENT
Cardiac  catheterization  and  coronary  angiography  are  indicated  to 
evaluate  the  extent  and  severity  of  cardiac  disease  in  symptomatic 
patients and to determine if medical, surgical, or catheter-based inter-
ventions  are  warranted  (Table 242-1).  They  are  also  used  to  exclude 
severe disease in symptomatic patients with equivocal findings on non-
invasive studies and in patients with chest-pain syndromes of unclear 
etiology for whom a definitive diagnosis is necessary for management. 
Cardiac  catheterization  is  not  mandatory  prior  to  cardiac  surgery  in 
some younger patients who have uncomplicated congenital or valvular 
heart disease that is well defined by noninvasive imaging and who do 
not have symptoms or risk factors that suggest concomitant coronary 
artery disease.

The  risks  associated  with  elective  cardiac  catheterization  are  rel-
atively  low,  with  a  reported  risk  of  <0.1%  for  myocardial  infarction, 
0.01%  for  stroke,  and  0.05%  for  death.  For  elective  and  emergent 
procedures,  the  in-hospital  mortality  is  1.4%.  These  risks  increase 
substantially  if  the  catheterization  is  performed  emergently,  during 
acute myocardial infarction, or in hemodynamically unstable patients. 
Additional risks of the procedure include tachy- or bradyarrhythmias 
that require countershock or pharmacologic therapy, acute renal failure 
leading to transient or permanent dialysis, vascular complications that 
necessitate  surgical  repair  or  percutaneous  intervention,  and  signifi-
cant access-site bleeding. Of these risks, vascular access-site bleeding 
is the most common complication, occurring in 1.5–2.0% of patients, 
with  major  bleeding  events  associated  with  a  worse  short-  and  long-
term outcome.

In  patients  who  understand  and  accept  the  risks  associated  with 
cardiac catheterization, there are no absolute contraindications when 
the procedure is performed in anticipation of a life-saving intervention. 
Relative  contraindications  do,  however,  exist;  these  include  decom-
pensated  congestive  heart  failure;  acute  renal  failure;  severe  chronic 
renal insufficiency, unless dialysis is planned; bacteremia; acute stroke; 
active  gastrointestinal  bleeding;  excessive  anticoagulation  or  recent 
lytic  administration;  severe,  uncorrected  electrolyte  abnormalities;  a

history of an anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction to iodinated contrast 
agents  without  premedication;  and  a  history  of  allergy/anaphylaxis/ 
bronchospasm to aspirin in patients for whom progression to a percu-
taneous coronary intervention is likely and aspirin desensitization has 
not been performed.

Contrast  allergy  and  contrast-induced  acute  kidney  injury  merit 
further  consideration,  because  these  adverse  events  may  occur  in 
otherwise  healthy  individuals  and  prophylactic  measures  exist  to 
reduce risk. Allergic reactions to contrast agents occur in <5% of cases, 
with  severe  anaphylactoid  (clinically  indistinguishable  from  anaph-
ylaxis,  but  not  mediated  by  an  IgE  mechanism)  reactions  occurring 
in 0.1–0.2% of patients. Mild reactions manifest as nausea, vomiting, 
and urticaria, while severe anaphylactoid reactions lead to hypotensive 

shock,  pulmonary  edema,  and  cardiorespiratory  arrest.  Patients  with 
a history of significant contrast allergy should be premedicated for at 
least  24  hours  prior  to  planned  coronary  angiography  with  corticos-
teroids and antihistamines (H1-blockers) and studies performed with 
nonionic, low-osmolar contrast agents that have a lower reported rate 
of allergic reactions.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury, defined as an increase in crea-
tinine >0.5 mg/dL or 25% above baseline that occurs 48–72 h after con-
trast administration, occurs in ~2–7% of patients with rates of 20–30% 
reported in high-risk patients, including those with diabetes mellitus, 
congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, anemia, older age, or 
who present with an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Dial-
ysis is required in 0.3–0.7% of patients and is associated with a fivefold 
increase in in-hospital mortality. For all patients, adequate intravascular 
volume  expansion  with  intravenous  0.9%  saline  (1.0–1.5  mL/kg  per 
hour)  for  3–12  h  before  and  continued  6–24  h  after  the  procedure 
limits the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury by >50%. Pre-
treatment with N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) has not reduced the risk 
of contrast-induced acute kidney injury consistently and, therefore, is 
no longer recommended routinely. Diabetic patients treated with met-
formin should stop the drug 24 h prior to the procedure and not restart 
until 48 h after contrast administration to limit the associated risk of 
lactic acidosis. Other strategies to decrease risk include the adminis-
tration of sodium bicarbonate (3 mL/kg per hour) 1 h before and 6 h 
after the procedure (similar outcome to saline infusion); use of low- or 
iso-osmolar  contrast  agents;  and  limiting  the  volume  of  contrast  to  
<50 mL per procedure.

Cardiac  catheterization  is  performed  after  the  patient  has  fasted 
for  6  h  and  has  received  intravenous  conscious  sedation  to  remain 
awake  but  sedated  during  the  procedure.  All  patients  with  suspected 
coronary artery disease are pretreated with 325 mg aspirin. In patients 
in  whom  the  procedure  is  likely  to  progress  to  a  percutaneous  coro-
nary  intervention,  an  additional  antiplatelet  agent  should  be  started: 
clopidogrel (600-mg loading dose and 75 mg daily), prasugrel (60-mg 
loading dose and 10 mg daily), or ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose and 
90  mg  twice  daily).  Prasugrel  should  not  be  selected  for  individuals 
with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack and is not recommended 
for patients 75 years of age or older. Warfarin is held starting 2–3 days 
prior to the catheterization to allow the international normalized ratio 
(INR) to fall to <1.7 and limit access-site bleeding complications. The 
direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) should be stopped 24–48 h prior 
to the test. Cardiac catheterization is a sterile procedure, so antibiotic 
prophylaxis is not required.

 ■ TECHNIQUE
Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography provide a detailed 
hemodynamic  and  anatomic  assessment  of  the  heart  and  coronary 
arteries.  The  selection  of  procedures  is  dependent  on  the  patient’s 
symptoms  and  clinical  condition,  with  some  direction  provided  by 
noninvasive studies.

Vascular Access  Cardiac catheterization procedures are performed 
using  a  percutaneous  technique  to  enter  the  femoral  or  radial  artery 
and  femoral,  brachial,  or  internal  jugular  vein  as  the  access  sites  for 
left  and  right  heart  catheterization,  respectively.  A  flexible  sheath  is 
inserted into the vessel over a guidewire, allowing diagnostic catheters 
to be introduced into the vessel and advanced toward the heart using 
fluoroscopic guidance. The radial artery (or rarely the brachial artery) 
access site is advantageous in patients with peripheral arterial disease 
that involves the abdominal aorta, iliac, or femoral vessels; severe iliac 
artery tortuosity; morbid obesity; or preference for early postprocedure 
ambulation.  Use  of  radial  artery  access  is  the  preferred  access  route 
due to a lower rate of access-site bleeding complications and improved 
patient comfort. A normal modified Allen’s test or Barbeau test con-
firming dual blood supply to the hand from the radial and ulnar arter-
ies is recommended prior to access at this site. The internal jugular or 
antecubital veins serve as the preferred access sites to the right heart 
when the patient has an inferior vena cava filter in place or requires 
prolonged hemodynamic monitoring.

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular SystemRight Heart Catheterization  This procedure measures pressures 
in  the  right  heart  and  pulmonary  artery.  Right  heart  catheterization 
is  no  longer  a  routine  part  of  diagnostic  cardiac  catheterization,  but 
it  is  reasonable  in  patients  with  unexplained  dyspnea,  pulmonary 
hypertension, valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, right and/or 
left  ventricular  dysfunction,  congenital  heart  disease,  and  suspected 
intracardiac shunts. Right heart catheterization most commonly uses 
a balloon-tipped flotation catheter that is advanced sequentially to the 
right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary wedge 
position (as a surrogate for left atrial pressure) using fluoroscopic guid-
ance; in each cardiac chamber, pressure is measured and blood samples 
are obtained for oxygen saturation analysis to screen for intracardiac 
shunts and calculate a cardiac output.

Left  Heart  Catheterization  This  procedure  measures  pressures 
in the left heart as a determinant of left ventricular performance. With 
the aid of fluoroscopy, a catheter is guided to the ascending aorta and 
across the aortic valve into the left ventricle to provide a direct measure 
of  left  ventricular  pressure.  In  patients  with  a  tilting-disc  prosthetic 
aortic valve, crossing the valve with a catheter is contraindicated, and 
the left heart may be accessed via a transseptal technique from the right 
atrium  using  a  needle-tipped  catheter  to  puncture  the  atrial  septum 
at the fossa ovalis. Once the catheter crosses from the right to the left 
atrium, it can be advanced across the mitral valve to the left ventricle. 
This technique is also used for mitral valvuloplasty. Heparin is given 
for  prolonged  procedures  to  limit  the  risk  of  stroke  from  embolism 
of  clots  that  may  form  on  the  catheter.  For  patients  with  heparin- 
induced thrombocytopenia, the direct thrombin inhibitors bivalirudin  
(0.75 mg/kg bolus, 1.75 mg/kg per hour for the duration of the proce-
dure) or argatroban (350 μg/kg bolus, 15 μg/kg per min for the dura-
tion of the procedure) may be used.
 ■ HEMODYNAMICS
A  comprehensive  hemodynamic  assessment  involves  obtaining  pres-
sure measurements in the right and left heart and peripheral arterial 
system and determining the cardiac output (Table 242-2). The shape

and  magnitude  of  the  pressure  waveforms  provide  important  diag-
nostic information; an example of normal pressure tracings is shown 
in Fig. 242-1. In the absence of valvular heart disease, the atria and 
ventricles  are  “one  chamber”  during  diastole  when  the  tricuspid  
and mitral valves are open, whereas in systole, when the pulmonary 
and aortic valves are open, the ventricles and their respective outflow 
tracts  are  considered  “one  chamber.”  These  concepts  form  the  basis 
by  which  hemodynamic  measurements  are  used  to  assess  valvular 
stenosis.  When  aortic  stenosis  is  present,  there  is  a  systolic  pressure 
gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta; when mitral stenosis 
is present, there is a diastolic pressure gradient between the pulmonary 
capillary wedge (left atrial) pressure and the left ventricle (Fig. 242-2). 
Hemodynamic measurements also discriminate between aortic steno-
sis  and  hypertrophic  obstructive  cardiomyopathy  where  the  asym-
metrically  hypertrophied  septum  creates  a  dynamic  intraventricular 
pressure  gradient  during  ventricular  systole.  The  magnitude  of  this 
obstruction is measured using an end-hole catheter positioned at the 
left ventricular apex that is pulled back while recording pressure; once 
the catheter has passed the septal obstruction and is positioned in the 
apex of the left ventricle, a gradient can be measured between the left 
ventricular apex and the aorta. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyo-
pathy is confirmed by the Brockenbrough-Braunwald sign: following 
a  premature  ventricular  contraction,  there  is  an  increase  in  the  left 
ventricular–aorta  pressure  gradient  with  a  simultaneous  decrease  in 
the aortic pulse pressure. The finding of a decrease in pulse pressure is 
absent in aortic stenosis.

Regurgitant valvular lesions increase volume (and pressure) in the 
“receiving”  cardiac  chamber.  In  severe  mitral  and  tricuspid  regur-
gitation,  the  increase  in  blood  flow  to  the  atria  takes  place  during 
ventricular  systole,  leading  to  an  increase  in  the  v  wave  (often  two 
times  greater  than  the  mean  pressure).  The  size  of  the  v  wave  is  a 
measure  of  the  compliance  of  the  left  atrium  but  is  not  a  reliable 
measure  of  the  severity  of  the  mitral  regurgitation.  Severe  aortic 
regurgitation  leads  to  a  decrease  in  aortic  diastolic  pressure  with  a 
concomitant  rise  in  left  ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure,  result-
ing  in  equalization  of  pressures  between  the  two  chambers  at  end  
diastole.

Hemodynamic measurements are also used to differentiate between 
cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, and restrictive cardiomy-
opathy  (Table  242-3).  In  cardiac  tamponade,  right  atrial  pressure  is 
increased with a decreased or absent “y” descent, indicative of impaired 
right atrial emptying in diastole, and there is diastolic equalization of 
pressures  in  all  cardiac  chambers.  In  constrictive  pericarditis,  right 
atrial  pressure  is  elevated  with  a  prominent  “y”  descent,  indicating 
rapid filling of the right ventricle during early diastole. A diastolic dip 
and  plateau,  or  “square  root  sign,”  in  the  ventricular  waveforms  due 
to  an  abrupt  halt  in  ventricular  filling  during  diastole,  elevated  right 
ventricular  and  pulmonary  artery  pressures,  and  discordant  pressure 
changes in the right and left ventricles with inspiration (right ventric-
ular systolic pressure increases while left ventricular systolic pressure 
decreases) are observed. In the absence of constriction, the two ventric-
ular pressures are concordant. The latter hemodynamic phenomenon 
is the most specific for constriction. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may 
be  distinguished  from  constrictive  pericarditis  by  a  marked  increase 
in  right  ventricular  and  pulmonary  artery  systolic  pressures  (usually 
>60  mmHg),  a  separation  of  the  left  and  right  ventricular  diastolic 
pressures  by  >5  mmHg  (at  baseline  or  with  acute  volume  loading), 
and  concordant  changes  in  left  and  right  ventricular  diastolic  filling 
pressures with inspiration (both increase).

Cardiac Output  Cardiac output is measured by the Fick method or 
the thermodilution technique. Typically, the Fick method and thermo-
dilution technique are both performed during cardiac catheterization, 
although the Fick method is considered more reliable in the presence of 
tricuspid regurgitation and in low-output states. The Fick method uses 
oxygen  as  the  indicator  substance  and  is  based  on  the  principle  that 
the amount of a substance taken up or released by an organ (oxygen 
consumption) is equal to the product of its blood flow (cardiac output) 
and the difference in the concentration of the substance in the arterial

tracings  have  a  characteristic  “a”  wave  that  reflects  atrial  contraction  and  a  “v”  wave  that  reflects  pressure 
changes in the atrium during ventricular systole. Ventricular pressure tracings have a low-pressure diastolic filling

and venous circulation (arterial-venous oxygen difference). Thus, the 
formula for calculating the Fick cardiac output is:

Cardiac output (L/min) = (oxygen consumption [mL/min])/ 
(arterial-venous oxygen difference [mL/L])

Oxygen consumption is estimated as 125 mL oxygen/minute × body 
surface area, and the arterial-venous oxygen difference is determined 
by first calculating the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood (hemoglobin 
[g/100 mL] × 1.36 [mL oxygen/g hemoglobin] × 10) and multiplying 
this product by the fractional oxygen saturation. The indicator dilution 
method  measures  the  concentration  of  a  substance  that  is  injected 
proximally,  adequately  mixes  with  blood,  and  is  then 
sampled  distally.  In  contemporary  practice,  thermodi-
lution cardiac outputs are measured using temperature 
as the indicator. Measurements are made with a therm-
istor-tipped catheter that detects temperature deviations 
in the pulmonary artery after the injection of 10 mL of 
room-temperature normal saline into the right atrium.

ECG

Vascular Resistance  Resistance across the systemic 
and pulmonary circulations is calculated by extrapolat-
ing from Ohm’s law of electrical resistance and is equal 
to the mean pressure gradient divided by the mean flow 
(cardiac output). Therefore, systemic vascular resistance 
is ([mean aortic pressure − mean right atrial pressure]/
cardiac  output)  multiplied  by  80  to  convert  the  resis-
tance  from  Wood  units  to  dyn-s-cm−5.  Similarly,  the 
pulmonary  vascular  resistance  is  ([mean  pulmonary 
artery  −  mean  pulmonary  capillary  wedge  pressure]/
cardiac  output)  ×  80.  Pulmonary  vascular  resistance 
is  lowered  by  oxygen,  nitroprusside,  calcium  channel 
blockers,  prostacyclin  infusions,  and  inhaled  nitric 
oxide;  these  therapies  may  be  administered  during 
catheterization  to  determine  if  increased  pulmonary 
vascular resistance is fixed or reversible.

valve area is: Area = (cardiac output [cm3/
min]/[systolic  ejection  period  or  diastolic 
filling period][heart rate])/44.3 C × square 
root  of  the  pressure  gradient,  where  C  = 
1  for  aortic  valve  and  0.85  for  the  mitral 
valve. A valve area of <1.0 cm2 and a mean 
gradient  of  >40  mmHg  indicate  severe 
aortic  stenosis,  while  a  valve  area  of  <1.5 
cm2 and a mean gradient >5–10 mmHg are 
consistent  with  moderate-to-severe  mitral 
stenosis;  in  symptomatic  patients  with  a 
mitral valve area >1.5 cm2, a mean gradient 
>15  mmHg,  pulmonary  artery  pressure 
>60 mmHg, or a pulmonary artery wedge 
pressure  >25  mmHg  after  exercise  is  also 
considered  significant  and  may  warrant 
intervention. The modified Hakki formula 
has also been used to estimate aortic valve 
area. This formula calculates the valve area 
as  the  cardiac  output  (L/min)  divided  by 
the  square  root  of  the  pressure  gradient. 
Aortic valve area calculations based on the 
Gorlin  formula  are  flow-dependent,  and 
therefore,  for  patients  with  low  cardiac 
outputs,  it  is  imperative  to  determine  if 
a  decreased  valve  area  actually  reflects  a 
fixed stenosis or is overestimated by a low 
cardiac  output  and  stroke  volume  that  is 
insufficient to open the valve leaflets fully. In these instances, cautious 
hemodynamic manipulation using dobutamine to increase the cardiac 
output and recalculation of the aortic valve area may be necessary.

Intracardiac Shunts 
In  patients  with  congenital  heart  disease  or 
unexplained  hypoxemia,  detection,  localization,  and  quantification 
of the intracardiac shunt should be evaluated. A shunt should be sus-
pected  when  there  is  unexplained  arterial  desaturation  or  increased 
oxygen saturation of venous blood. A “step up” or increase in oxygen 
content  indicates  the  presence  of  a  left-to-right  shunt  while  a  “step 
down” indicates a right-to-left shunt. The shunt is localized by detect-
ing a difference in oxygen saturation levels of 5–7% between adjacent

cardiac chambers. The severity of the shunt is determined by the ratio of 
pulmonary blood flow (Qp) to the systemic blood flow (Qs), or Qp/Qs =  
([systemic  arterial  oxygen  content  −  mixed  venous  oxygen  content]/
pulmonary vein oxygen content − pulmonary artery oxygen content). 
For an atrial septal defect, a shunt ratio of 1.5 is considered significant 
and  factored  with  other  clinical  variables  to  determine  the  need  for 
intervention. When a congenital ventricular septal defect is present, a 
shunt ratio of ≥2.0 with evidence of left ventricular volume overload is 
a strong indication for surgical correction.

three beats defines 4+ mitral regurgitation. When it takes more than 3 
beats but fully fills the atrium, it is 3+. Both 3+ and 4+ are considered 
severe  regurgitation.  Ventriculography  performed  in  the  left  anterior 
oblique projection can be used to identify a ventricular septal defect. 
Calculation  of  the  ventricular  volumes  in  systole  and  diastole  allows 
calculation of stroke volume and cardiac output.

Aortography  in  the  cardiac  catheterization  laboratory  visualizes 
abnormalities  of  the  ascending  aorta,  including  aneurysmal  dilation 
and involvement of the great vessels, as well as dissection with com-
pression  of  the  true  lumen  by  an  intimal  flap  that  separates  the  true 

 ■ VENTRICULOGRAPHY 
AND AORTOGRAPHY
Ventriculography to assess left ventric-
ular  function  may  be  performed  dur-
ing  cardiac  catheterization.  A  pigtail 
catheter  is  advanced  retrograde  across 
the  aortic  valve  into  the  left  ventricle, 
and  30–45  mL  of  contrast  is  power- 
injected to visualize the left ventricular 
chamber during the cardiac cycle. The 
ventriculogram  is  usually  performed 
in the right anterior oblique projection 
to  examine  wall  motion  and  mitral 
valve  function.  Normal  wall  motion 
is  observed  as  symmetric  contraction 
of  all  segments;  hypokinetic  segments 
have  decreased  contraction,  akinetic 
segments  do  not  contract,  and  dyski-
netic  segments  appear  to  bulge  para-
doxically  during  systole  (Fig.  242-3). 
Ventriculography  may  also  reveal  a 
left  ventricular  aneurysm,  pseudoan-
eurysm,  or  diverticulum  and  can  be 
used  to  assess  mitral  valve  prolapse 
and the severity of mitral regurgitation. 
The  degree  of  mitral  regurgitation  is 
estimated  by  comparing  the  density 
of  contrast  opacification  of  the  left 
atrium  with  that  of  the  left  ventricle. 
Minimal  contrast  reflux  into  the  left 
atrium  is  considered  1+  mitral  regur-
gitation,  while  contrast  density  in  the 
left  atrium  that  is  greater  than  that  in 
the  left  ventricle  with  reflux  of  con-
trast  into  the  pulmonary  veins  within

and  false  lumina.  Aortography  can  also  be  used  to  identify  patent 
saphenous vein grafts that elude selective cannulation, identify shunts 
that involve the aorta such as a patent ductus arteriosus, evaluate the 
takeoff or proximal anatomy of the great vessels, and provide a quali-
tative assessment of aortic regurgitation using a 1+−4+ scale similar to 
that used for mitral regurgitation.

 ■ CINEFLUOROSCOPY OF PROSTHETIC 
MECHANICAL VALVES
Prosthetic valve leaflet dysfunction may occur as a result of thrombus 
or  obstruction  of  leaflet  excursion  by  pannus  (Fig. 242-4).  The  inci-
dence  of  prosthetic  valve  thrombosis  in  left-sided  valves  is  0.1–6.0% 
per  patient-year  with  differences  in  rates  attributable  to  valve  type, 
position,  anticoagulation  status,  and  left  ventricular  function.  Pros-
thetic  valve  dysfunction  should  be  suspected  in  patients  with  sub-
therapeutic  anticoagulation  with  a  low  mean  INR,  a  prothrombotic 
state,  recent-onset  heart  failure,  cardiogenic  shock,  cardiac  arrest, 
thromboembolic  event,  or,  in  asymptomatic  patients,  an  increasing 
gradient  across  the  valve.  Cinefluoroscopy  visualizes  the  motion  of 
mechanical valve leaflets, is noninvasive, is available in most centers, 
and can be performed rapidly with minimal radiation exposure. Pros-
thetic mechanical valves should be imaged en face and at a 90° angle 
over  several  cardiac  cycles  to  document  opening  and  closing  of  the 
valve leaflets as well as motion of the base ring. Each type of prosthetic 
valve  has  leaflet  opening  and  closing  angles  that  are  reported  by  the 
manufacturer  and  can  be  used  to  determine  if  movement  or  closure 
of the valve leaflets is restricted, suggestive of mechanical obstruction.

CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY
Selective  coronary  angiography  is  almost  always  performed  during 
cardiac catheterization and is used to define the coronary anatomy and 
determine the extent of epicardial coronary artery and coronary artery 
bypass  graft  disease.  Specially  shaped  coronary  catheters  are  used  to 

engage the left and right coronary ostia. Hand injection of radiopaque 
contrast  agents  creates  a  coronary  “luminogram”  that  is  recorded  as 
radiographic  images  (cine  angiography).  Because  the  coronary  arter-
ies are three-dimensional objects that are in motion with the cardiac 
cycle,  angiograms  of  the  vessels  using  several  different  orthogonal 
projections  are  taken  to  best  visualize  the  vessels  without  overlap  or 
foreshortening.

The normal coronary anatomy is highly variable between individuals, 
but, in general, there are two coronary ostia and three major coronary 
vessels—the left anterior descending, the left circumflex, and the right 
coronary arteries with the left anterior descending and left circumflex 
arteries arising from the left main coronary artery (Fig. 242-5). When 
the  right  coronary  artery  is  the  origin  of  the  atrioventricular  nodal 
branch, the posterior descending artery, and the posterior lateral ves-
sels, the circulation is defined as right dominant; this is found in ~85% 
of  individuals.  When  these  branches  arise  from  the  left  circumflex 
artery,  as  occurs  in  ~5%  of  individuals,  the  circulation  is  defined  as 
left  dominant.  The  remaining  ~10%  of  patients  have  a  codominant 
circulation with the posterior descending vessel arising from both the 
right coronary and the posterior lateral vessels from left coronary cir-
culation. In some patients, a ramus intermedius branch arises directly 
from the left main coronary artery that trifurcates into the left anterior 
descending,  ramus,  and  circumflex  arteries;  this  finding  is  a  normal 
variant.  Coronary  artery  anomalies  occur  in  1–2%  of  patients,  with 
separate ostia for the left anterior descending and left circumflex arter-
ies being the most common (0.41%).

Coronary angiography visualizes coronary artery stenoses as lumi-
nal  narrowings  on  the  cine  angiogram.  The  degree  of  narrowing 
is  referred  to  as  the  percent  stenosis  and  is  determined  visually  by 
comparing  the  most  severely  diseased  segment  with  a  proximal  or 
distal  “normal  segment”;  a  stenosis  >50%  is  considered  significant  
(Fig.  242-6).  Online  quantitative  coronary  angiography  can  provide 
a  more  accurate  assessment  of  the  percent  stenosis  and  lessen  the 
tendency  to  overestimate  lesion  severity  visually.  The  presence  of  a 
myocardial  bridge,  which  most  commonly  involves  the  left  anterior 
descending  artery,  may  be  mistaken  for  a  significant  stenosis;  this 
occurs when a portion of the vessel dips below the epicardial surface 
into the myocardium and is subject to compressive forces during ven-
tricular systole. The key to differentiating a myocardial bridge from a 
fixed stenosis is that the “stenosed” part of the vessel returns to normal 
during diastole. Coronary calcification is also seen during angiography 
prior to the injection of contrast agents. Collateral blood vessels may 
be seen traversing from one vessel to the distal vasculature of a severely 
stenosed or totally occluded vessel. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarc-
tion (TIMI) flow grade, a measure of the relative duration of time that 
it takes for contrast to opacify the coronary artery fully, may provide 
an additional clue to the degree of lesion severity, and the presence of 
TIMI  grade  1  (minimal  filling)  or  2  (delayed  filling)  suggests  that  a 
severe coronary artery stenosis is present.

FIGURE 242-6  Coronary stenoses on cine angiogram and intravascular ultrasound. 
Significant stenoses in the coronary artery are seen as narrowings (black arrows) 
of the vessel. Intravascular ultrasound shows a normal segment of artery (A), areas 
with eccentric plaque (B, C), and near total obliteration of the lumen at the site of the 
significant stenosis (D). Note that the intravascular ultrasound catheter is present in 
the images as a black circle.

 ■ INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND, OPTICAL 
COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY, FRACTIONAL FLOW 
RESERVE, AND CORONARY FLOW RESERVE
During  coronary  angiography,  intermediate  stenoses  (40–70%),  inde-
terminate findings, or anatomic findings that are incongruous with the 
patient’s  symptoms  may  require  further  interrogation.  In  these  cases, 
intravascular  ultrasound  (IVUS)  provides  a  more  accurate  anatomic 
assessment of the coronary artery and the degree of coronary athero-
sclerosis (Fig. 242-6). IVUS is performed using a small flexible catheter 
with a 40-mHz transducer at its tip that is advanced into the coronary 
artery over a guidewire. Data from IVUS studies may be used to image 
atherosclerotic plaque precisely, determine luminal cross-sectional area, 
and measure vessel size; it is also used during or following percutaneous 
coronary intervention to assess the stenosis and determine the adequacy 
of stent placement. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a catheter- 
based  imaging  technique  that  uses  near-infrared  light  to  generate 
images with better spatial resolution than IVUS (12–18 microns vs 150–
200 microns); however, the depth of field is smaller. The advantage of 
OCT imaging over IVUS lies in its ability to image characteristics of the

assess coronary stent placement, apposition, and patency (Fig. 242-7).

Measurement  of  the  fractional  flow  reserve  provides  a  functional 
assessment  of  the  stenosis  and  is  more  accurate  in  predicting  long-
term  clinical  outcome  than  imaging  techniques.  The  fractional  flow 
reserve is the ratio of the pressure in the coronary artery distal to the 
stenosis divided by the pressure in the artery proximal to the stenosis 
at maximal vasodilation. Fractional flow reserve is measured using a 
coronary pressure–sensor guidewire at rest and at maximal hyperemia 
following  the  infusion  of  adenosine  (Fig.  242-8).  A  fractional  flow 
reserve of <0.80 indicates a hemodynamically significant stenosis that 
would  benefit  from  intervention.  The  instantaneous  wave-free  ratio, 
which measures the gradient across the stenosis during the latter part 
of diastole, does not require the use of adenosine and may be preferred 
for  some  patients  with  asthma  or  documented  allergy  to  adenosine. 
An  instantaneous  wave-free  ratio  of  <0.89  is  considered  positive  for 
ischemia. Resting gradients have also been shown to predict a signifi-
cant stenosis. Using both pressure and velocity, an index of myocardial 
resistance  can  also  be  calculated.  Studies  have  shown  this  to  be  an 
important predictor of outcome as well.

Microvascular dysfunction can be evaluated by assessing coronary 
flow reserve, the ratio between coronary blood flow at maximal hyper-
emia  and  rest.  Coronary  flow  reserve  is  measured  using  a  Doppler 
wire–  or  pressure  wire–based  thermodilution  technique  in  patients 
with unexplained chest pain or ischemia and no obstructive coronary 
artery disease. A coronary flow reserve <2.0 is considered abnormal.

 ■ POSTPROCEDURE CARE
Once the procedure is completed, vascular access sheaths are removed. 
If the femoral approach is used, direct manual compression or vascular 
closure devices that immediately close the arteriotomy site with a sta-
ple/clip, collagen plug, or sutures are used to achieve hemostasis. These 
devices decrease the length of supine bed rest (from 6 h to 2–4 h) and 
improve  patient  satisfaction  but  have  not  been  shown  definitively  to 
be superior to manual compression with respect to access-site compli-
cations. With radial-artery access, the sheath is removed and a plastic 
wristband with an air pillow is used to keep pressure on the access site 
while maintaining flow through the radial artery. Bed rest is needed for 
only 2 h. When cardiac catheterization is performed as an elective out-
patient procedure, the patient completes postprocedure bed rest in a 
monitored setting and is discharged home with instructions to liberal-
ize fluids because contrast agents promote an osmotic diuresis, to avoid 
strenuous activity, and to observe the vascular access site for signs of 
complications. Overnight hospitalization may be required for high-risk 
patients  with  significant  comorbidities,  patients  with  complications 
occurring during the catheterization, or patients who have undergone 
a complicated percutaneous coronary intervention. Hypotension early 
after  the  procedure  may  be  due  to  inadequate  fluid  replacement  or 
retroperitoneal  bleeding  from  the  access  site.  Patients  who  received 
>2 Gy of radiation during the procedure should be examined for signs 
of erythema. For patients who received higher doses (>5 Gy), clinical 
follow-up within 1 month to assess for skin injury is recommended.

electrophysiology also ushered in the development of antiarrhythmic 
drugs utilized by cardiac electrophysiologists.

The  modern  era  of  clinical  cardiac  electrophysiology  began  with 
the first recordings of human intracardiac electrograms in the 1960s. 
Initially,  invasive  electrophysiology  studies  were  limited  as  diagnos-
tic  tools.  This  included  serial  electrophysiologic  testing  to  evaluate 
arrhythmia mechanisms and evaluate arrhythmia suppression by anti-
arrhythmic  drugs,  and  programmed  stimulation  of  the  heart  for  risk 
stratification of sudden cardiac death. In the 1960s and 1970s, cardiac 
surgery was the only available invasive treatment for cardiac arrhyth-
mias. The subsequent development of radiofrequency catheter ablation 
in the 1980s ushered in the era of interventional cardiac electrophysi-
ology. In addition, with the development of implanted cardiac rhythm 
management devices including pacemakers and defibrillators, clinical 
cardiac electrophysiology became a distinct medical subspecialty.

Principles of Clinical  
Cardiac Electrophysiology
William H. Sauer, Bruce A. Koplan, Paul C. Zei

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Clinical  cardiac  electrophysiology  is  the  subspecialty  of  cardiology 
that focuses on the study and management of heart rhythm disorders. 
The development of the modern surface electrocardiogram (ECG) by 
Willem  Einthoven  more  than  100  years  ago  enabled  understanding 
of  the  relationship  between  cardiac  electrical  potentials,  mechanical 
cardiac function, and pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmias. In the 
mid-twentieth  century,  the  recording  of  cellular  membrane  currents 
enabled  the  understanding  that  the  surface  ECG  represents  the  sum 
of  cellular  cardiac  electrical  activity.  An  understanding  of  cellular 

CELLULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
The cardiac action potential (AP) drives the electrophysiologic behav-
ior of all cardiac myocytes. The AP is characterized morphologically 
by  five  distinct  phases,  termed  phases  0–4,  as  shown  in  Fig.  243-1. 
Moreover,  as  ventricular  electrophysiologic  activity  accounts  for  the 
QRS and T complexes of the surface ECG, each AP phase in ventricular 
tissues corresponds to distinct phases in the surface ECG: Phase 0, the 
rapid upstroke, corresponds to the QRS deflection; phases 1–2 account 
for  the  ST  segment;  phase  3  accounts  for  the  T  wave;  while  phase  4 
corresponds to the segment between the end of the T wave and the sub-
sequent QRS deflection. In addition, the P wave corresponds to atrial 
depolarization, while the PR interval corresponds to the time between 
initiation of atrial depolarization to the initiation of ventricular depo-
larization, comprised (typically) for the most part by the conduction 
time through the AV node.

AP  morphologies  are  the  result  of  the  precise  and  carefully  timed 
sequences  of  opening,  closing,  and  inactivation  of  an  array  of  mem-
brane ion channels in response to cellular membrane potential changes, 
ligands that bind to the ion channel complex, or membrane stretch in 
a time-dependent fashion. The open ion channel allows flux of specific 
charged ions through a central pore, resulting in electrical (ionic) cur-
rents that drive the AP. The activity of different subsets of ion channels 
drives the different phases of the AP. Specific ionic currents that flux 
through  an  open  channel  are  driven  by  the  electrochemical  gradient

FIGURE 243-1  A. Cellular atrial and ventricular action potentials. Phases 0–4 are the rapid upstroke, early repolarization, plateau, late repolarization, and diastole, respectively. 
The ionic currents and their respective genes are shown above and below the action potentials. The currents that underlie the action potentials vary in atrial and ventricular 
myocytes. Potassium current (IK1) is the principal current during phase 4 and determines the resting membrane potential of the myocyte. Sodium current generates the upstroke 
of the action potential (phase 0); activation of Ito with inactivation of the Na current inscribes early repolarization (phase 1). The plateau (phase 2) is generated by a balance of 
repolarizing potassium currents and depolarizing calcium current. Inactivation of the calcium current with persistent activation of potassium currents (predominantly IKr and IKs) 
causes phase 3 repolarization. Currents that result in membrane depolarization are grouped at the top of the figure above the action potentials, while repolarizing currents are 
shown below the action potentials.   B. A surface ECG representation of sinus rhythm is shown with respective intracardiac action potentials that are active during each phase 
of the ECG. Each cardiac conduction region’s action potential is shown in the upper portion of the panel, with colors reflected in the ECG segment shown in the lower portion of 
the panel. Note that during the P wave, atrial depolarization is active. During the PR interval, the AV nodal, His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers are active (in sequence), 
although these action potentials are not discernible on the surface ECG. During the QRS interval, ventricular action potentials are active, with the QRS morphology most reflective 
of the sequence of ventricular tissue action potential activation. The ST segment is predominantly determined by the plateau phase 2 of the ventricular action potential. The  
T wave is determined largely by ventricular repolarization (phase 3), while the isoelectric segment is the result of the electrically neutral phase 4 of the ventricular action 
potential.

of that particular ion across the membrane, which in turn is driven by 
ion pumps or transporters/exchangers, which in turn are catalyzed by 
ATP (Fig. 243-2).

Ion channels are complex, multi-subunit transmembrane glycopro-
teins that contain a central pore that is selective for particular ionic spe-
cies (selectivity); a “gating” apparatus that regulates the opening, closing, 
and inactivation apparatus; and often one or more regulatory subunits. 
Most  channels  gate  in  response  to  changes  in  membrane  potential,  a 
specific  ligand,  or  mechanical  deformation.  The  molecular  underpin-
nings of these specific functional properties of channels have become 
well  understood  through  decades  of  basic  electrophysiologic  study 
using the tools of voltage clamp and patch clamp techniques, and more 
recently, molecular, genetic, and structural/crystallographic techniques.
The structural makeup of most ion channels contains several com-
mon motifs. All channels form a central conducting pore, with ionic 
selectivity  determined  by  specific  amino  acids  that  line  the  central 
pore. The central pore of most channels is formed by the P domain, 
a series of hydrophilic amino acid residues, with one of several struc-
tural  variants:  four  separate  homologous  alpha  subunits,  each  with 
homologous  P  domains  (voltage-gated  K  channels);  a  single  alpha 
subunit with four internally homologous P domains (voltage-gated Na 
or  Ca  channels);  or  two  internally  homologous  P  domains  from  two 
separate subunits (most ligand-gated K channels). A series of one or 
more transmembrane segments surrounds the central pore. In voltage-
gated channels, the fourth of six segments, the S4 segment, contains a 
series of charged amino acid residues that functions as a voltage sensor, 
responding  to  changes  in  membrane  potential  by  facilitating  protein 
conformational changes that result in channel opening or closing (gat-
ing). In ligand-activated channels, the binding of a ligand (transmitters, 
molecules, or other ions) results in channel opening or closing, while 
deformations in membrane shape determine gating in stretch-activated 
channels.  In  addition,  in  many  ion  channels,  a  complex  of  auxiliary 
proteins is associated with the primary alpha subunit; most auxiliary 

subunits appear to facilitate regulation of ion channel expression and 
activity. A distinct type of transmembrane protein complex is the gap 
junction  complex.  A  large  multimeric  complex  of  connexin  subunits 
forms a large, nonselective pore that spans and thereby connects adja-
cent myocytes. This allows free flux of ions between adjacent myocytes, 
facilitating impulse propagation across myocardial tissues.

Due to the physiologic gradient of their respective ions across the 
cell membrane, Na and Ca channels account for most inward, or depo-
larizing, currents in cardiac myocytes, and these channels respond to 
membrane depolarization with rapid opening, relatively rapid closing, 
and inactivation. Na and Ca currents therefore drive phase 0 depolar-
ization of the AP. Potassium channels, on the other hand, account for 
most of the repolarizing currents seen in cardiac myocytes. Relatively 
slow  K  channel  opening,  as  well  as  Na  and  Ca  channel  closing  and 
inactivation, drives the plateau of phases 1–2 as well as the repolarizing 
phase  3  of  the  AP.  Mutations  in  K  channel  subtypes  are  causative  of 
many inherited channelopathies. Mutations that either inherently delay 
the closing or inactivation of K channels result in prolongation of the 
QT interval, leading to many forms of inherited long QT syndrome.

The  morphologic  and  functional  properties  of  APs  vary  across 
different regions of the heart. These variations are the result of varia-
tions in the active ionic currents during each phase of the AP, which 
in turn reflects regional variation in ion channel expression. In atrial 
and  ventricular  myocytes,  Na  currents  dominate  the  rapid  upstroke 
(phase 1) of the AP, while in nodal tissues, Ca currents, which activate 
more  slowly,  dominate  phase  1.  Hence,  for  instance,  drugs  that  bind 
and  block  the  cardiac  Na  channel  demonstrate  efficacy  in  treating 
tachyarrhythmias  arising  from  the  atria  and  ventricles,  whereas  Ca 
channel blocking agents demonstrate efficacy at nodal tissues. During 
the pre-depolarizing phase 4 of the AP, ionic currents remain relatively 
quiescent in atrial and ventricular myocytes as they await local depo-
larization that triggers the next AP. In contrast, in sinus nodal tissues, 
which  possess  the  property  of  automaticity,  or  intrinsic  rhythmic

NORMAL CARDIAC IMPULSE 
PROPAGATION
The normal cardiac impulse initiates and travels through 
specialized  conduction  fibers,  often  referred  to  as  the 
cardiac  conduction  system.  Each  impulse  is  initiated  in 
the  sinoatrial  (SA)  node,  located  at  the  lateral  junction 
between  the  superior  vena  cava  (SVC)  and  right  atrium 
(RA).  SA  nodal  tissues  exhibit  automaticity,  such  that  a 
reliable,  rhythmic  impulse  emanates  from  the  SA  node. 
The  SA  node  (along  with  the  AV  node)  is  richly  inner-
vated by autonomic fibers, allowing precise and dynamic 
control  of  heart  rate  and  overall  function  by  the  central 
nervous system. The normal impulse then travels across 
the RA then the LA across preferential conduction path-
ways,  initiating  atrial  systole.  Once  the  impulse  reaches 
the AV node, conduction occurs in a relatively slow time 
frame through the AV nodal tissues. This conduction time 
not only serves to provide physiologic AV synchrony, but 
it also is reflected in the surface ECG as the PR interval, 
or time between the atrial inscription and the subsequent 
ventricular,  or  QRS,  complex.  In  normal  hearts,  the  AV 
node  serves  as  the  only  electrical  connection  between 
atria and ventricles. Both the SA and AV nodes respond 
exquisitely to autonomic input; for instance, with exercise 
and  increased  adrenergic  tone,  the  PR  interval  physio-
logically shortens. After the AV node, the impulse travels 
through  a  network  of  specialized  conduction  fibers:  the 
bundle of His divides into a right and left bundle branch, 
which  transmit  conduction  to  the  right  and  left  ventri-
cles,  respectively.  The  left  bundle  then  divides  further 
into left anterior and left posterior fascicles. The fascicles 
then further divide into Purkinje fibers. The conduction 
velocity of electrical impulses is much higher in Purkinje 
fibers  (2–3  m/s)  than  in  myocardial  cells  (0.3–0.4  m/s). 
Different connexins in gap junctions of Purkinje networks 
are partially responsible for more rapid conduction. This 
network  of  conductive  Purkinje  fibers  is  located  endo-
cardially  and  serves  to  rapidly  transmit  depolarization 
throughout the ventricles, such that myocardial depolar-
ization, and hence mechanical contraction, occur rapidly 
and  in  a  coordinated,  synchronized  fashion,  optimizing 
mechanical  contraction  of  the  ventricles.  Repolarization 
of the ventricular myocardium, on the other hand, occurs 
relatively  slowly  and  progresses  from  the  epicardial  sur-
face  back  toward  the  endocardium.  Hence,  the  T  wave 
inscription  in  most  ECG  leads  is  concordant  with  the 
QRS complex.

FIGURE  243-2  Topology  and  subunit  composition  of  the  voltage-dependent  ion  channels. 
Potassium channels are formed by the tetramerization of α or pore-forming subunits and one or 
more β subunits; only single β subunits are shown for clarity. Sodium and calcium channels are 
composed of α subunits with four homologous domains and one or more ancillary subunits. In all 
channel types, the loop of protein between the fifth and sixth membrane-spanning repeat in each 
subunit or domain forms the ion-selective pore. In the case of the sodium channel, the channel is 
a target for phosphorylation, the linker between the third and fourth homologous domain is critical 
to inactivation, and the sixth membrane-spanning repeat in the fourth domain is important in local 
anaesthetic antiarrhythmic drug binding. The Ca channel is a multi-subunit protein complex with 
the α1 subunit containing the pore and major drug-binding domain.

depolarization, there is gradual depolarization observed during phase 
4, until a threshold is reached that initiates the next AP. In these nodal 
tissues, this depolarizing phase 4 current is generated by a semiselective 
Na/Ca channel, termed the “funny current” or If, which is the target for 
the medication ivabradine.

MECHANISMS OF CARDIAC 
ARRHYTHMIAS
Cardiac  arrhythmias  are  the  manifestation  of  abnormal-
ities  in  the  initiation  and/or  propagation  of  the  cardiac 
electrical  impulse.  Bradyarrhythmias  result  most  com-
monly from abnormalities in the specialized conduction 
tissues. Abnormal function of the SA node may result in 
pathologic sinus bradycardia; AV node disease may result 
in  conduction  block;  pathology  in  the  His-Purkinje  sys-
tem may result in conduction block as well. Tachyarrhyth-
mias may arise from not only nearly every location within 
the  conduction  tissues,  but  also  within  atrial  or  ventric-
ular  tissues.  Tachyarrhythmias  are  typically  classified  by 
mechanism:  enhanced  automaticity  refers  to  abnormal 
spontaneous  depolarization,  which  can  occur  along  the 
conduction system, the atria, or ventricles; triggered arrhythmias result 
from  abnormal  afterdepolarizations  that  occur  in  either  phase  2/3 
(early afterdepolarizations) or phase 4 (delayed afterdepolarizations) of 
the AP; reentry results from circus movement of an electrical impulse 
(see Table 243-1 and Fig. 243-3).

 ■ ENHANCED AUTOMATICITY
Automaticity,  defined  as  spontaneous  depolarizations  occurring  dur-
ing  phase  4  of  the  AP,  is  a  normal  property  of  several  myocardial 
tissues, including the SA node, AV node, and the His-Purkinje system. 
The automaticity of the SA node triggers the normal cardiac impulse. 
When the automaticity of a more proximal conduction system tissue 
is  unreliable  or  slow,  the  automaticity  of  a  more  distal  aspect  of  the 
conduction system may result in an “escape rhythm” that may maintain 
cardiac output. Automaticity in these tissues results from phase 4 depo-
larization of cellular membranes driven by several ionic currents. In the 
SA node, the nonselective Na/Ca If current drives this depolarization,

while in other tissues K currents, Ca currents, or even the Na/Ca and 
ATP-driven Na/K exchangers contribute.

The rate of depolarization during phase 4 drives the frequency APs, 
and hence automaticity rate of these tissues. In nodal tissues, this rate of 
depolarization is highly regulated by the autonomic system. Parasympa-
thetic input results in local acetylcholine (ACh) release, which then binds 
the  IKACh  potassium  channel  complex  (specifically  via  a  G  protein  
mediated mechanism). The opening of IKACh channels, resulting in K 
efflux, hyperpolarizes these cells, resulting in slowing of phase 4 depo-
larization, thereby slowing the automaticity rate. Sympathetic input, via 
catecholamines,  activates  both  alpha-  and  beta-adrenergic  receptors. 
Beta-1 adrenergic stimulation results in activation of L-type Ca channels, 
Ca influx, and as a result, enhanced depolarization rates during phase 4, 
and increased automaticity rates. The normal range of SA automaticity 
rates is between 30–220 beats/min, corresponding to the normal range 
of rates during sinus rhythm. The sinus rate at any instant is therefore a 
dynamic balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic input, with 
the latter dominating in the restful state. The intrinsic heart rate (IHR) 
is defined as the “native” automaticity rate of the SA node, absent any 
autonomic input.

Abnormally  enhanced  automaticity  may  occur  at  any  site  that 
exhibits automaticity, including the SA node, AV node, or His-Purkinje 
system, resulting in pathologic tachycardia. In addition, in pathologic 
states,  other  stereotyped  regions  in  the  heart  may  exhibit  enhanced 
automaticity, including the pulmonary veins, coronary sinus superior 
vena  cava,  and  ventricular  outflow  tracts.  Injury  to  myocardium, 
whether through ischemia or other mechanisms, may alter its cellular 
membrane  properties,  resulting  in  automaticity  in  these  tissues.  For 
instance, the border zones of infarcted ventricular myocardium, or rap-
idly reperfused ischemic myocardium, often exhibit automatic arrhyth-
mias  including  PVCs  or  automatic  idioventricular  rhythms  (AIVR). 
Abnormal automaticity in the pulmonary veins is believed to underpin 
the triggers that drive paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, while automaticity 
elsewhere in the atria drives atrial tachycardias.

 ■ AFTERDEPOLARIZATIONS AND TRIGGERED 
ARRHYTHMIAS
Afterdepolarizations  and  triggered  arrhythmias  refer  to  abnormal 
depolarizations that occur in the late phases of the AP (afterdepolar-
izations) that can initiate sustained arrhythmias. Early afterdepolariza-
tions (EADs) occur typically during phases 2–3 of the AP and may be 
facilitated by intracellular Ca loading. When the QT interval prolongs, 
typically in a heterogeneous fashion across the ventricles, EADs may 
trigger  wavefronts  of  abnormal  depolarizations,  resulting  in  torsades 
des pointes (TdP), a nonsustained or sustained ventricular arrhythmia 
that may result in cardiac arrest. Medications that prolong QT inter-
val,  as  well  as  other  QT  prolonging  factors  including  hypokalemia, 
hypomagnesemia, and bradycardia, predispose the ventricles to EADs 
leading  to  TdP.  Electrical  remodeling  in  cardiomyopathies  may  also 
predispose to QT prolongation and risk of EADs and TdP.

Delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) are abnormal depolarizations 
occurring  in  phase  4  of  the  AP.  The  mechanism  underlying  DADs 
is  increased  intracellular  Ca,  which  then  enhances  repetitive  depo-
larizations  during  the  late  phases  of  the  AP.  As  a  result,  repetitive 
depolarizations  ensue,  including  the  well-described  phenomenon 
of  bidirectional  ventricular  tachycardia.  Digitalis  glycoside  toxicity, 
ischemia, and catecholamines are the most commonly described causes  
for DADs.

 ■ REENTRY
Reentry  refers  to  the  circus  movement  of  a  wavefront  of  electrical 
activation. Reentry can occur around a fixed anatomic barrier, referred 
to as anatomic reentry, or around a functionally blocked or refractory 
barrier  or  anchor,  termed  functional  reentry.  Initiation  and  mainte-
nance  of  a  reentrant  arrhythmia  requires  (1)  unidirectional  block, 
where  the  electrical  wavefront  can  only  propagate  in  one  direction, 
and  (2)  slow  conduction,  a  zone  within  the  reentrant  circuit  where 
conduction is relatively slow, allowing the remainder of the circuit to 
repolarize and recover from refractoriness (the inability to re-excite).

The  more  common  form  of  reentry  is  anatomic,  which  requires 
a  defined  electrical/anatomic  circuit  with  a  pathway  around  a  fixed 
barrier.  A  wavefront  of  depolarization  encounters  a  barrier  to  con-
duction that allows propagation in only one direction (unidirectional 
block),  forcing  activation  preferentially  along  one  limb  or  pathway. 
Due to slow conduction, the depolarization wavefront travels through 
the  remaining  circuit  and  continually  encounters  tissues  that  have 
recovered from refractoriness and are hence excitable. This results in 
perpetual circus movement. Moreover, if the total length of the circuit 
exceeds a distance determined by the product of the conduction veloc-
ity (theta) of the tissue and the refractory period (duration) of that tis-
sue (tr), referred to as the wavelength of tachycardia (lambda = theta × 
tr), an excitable gap, where tissue is recovered from refractory and able 
to  depolarize,  is  created,  allowing  reentry.  Reentry  is  the  mechanism 
for  several  clinically  important  and  common  cardiac  arrhythmias, 
including atrial flutter, AV nodal reentry, AV reciprocating tachycardia 
utilizing an accessory pathway, and scar-based reentrant VT.

When reentry occurs in the absence of a fixed anatomic barrier, it is 
termed functional reentry. A nidus of partially refractory tissue anchors 
the depolarization wavefront, resulting in a circular or rotational reen-
trant wavefront. In this case, the reentrant circuit or activity tends to 
be less stable than that from anatomic reentry, resulting in variations in 
depolarization rate and propensity to easily terminate and/or reinitiate. 
There is evidence that functional reentry is the underlying mechanism 
for perpetuation and maintenance of both atrial fibrillation (AF) and 
ventricular  fibrillation  (VF).  In  both  of  these  apparently  chaotic  and 
disorganized arrhythmias, multiple wavefronts resulting from multiple 
functional reentrant circuits appear to drive arrhythmia in many, if not 
most, instances. Underlying pathology of the myocardium resulting in 
heterogeneous  electrophysiologic  properties,  altered  activation,  and 
repolarization  properties  predispose  myocardial  tissues  to  initiation 
and propagation of functional reentry-based arrhythmias.

In  addition  to  intrinsic  alterations  in  cellular  membrane  electro-
physiologic  properties  that  underpin  most  arrhythmias,  extrinsic 
factors  may  precipitate  other  architectural  and  tissue  changes  that 
contribute  proarrhythmia.  Ischemia  and  infarct  may  create  regions 
of  heterogeneous  fibrosis,  resulting  in  islands  of  scar  surrounded  by 
injured  tissue.  This  creates  the  anatomic  substrate  that  can  sustain 
anatomic  reentry,  which  underlies  scar-based  VT,  as  well  as  many 
macro-reentrant  atrial  arrhythmias.  Peri-infarct  border  zones  often 
contain  injured  myocardium  as  well,  and  the  resultant  alterations  in 
cellular  membrane  properties  may  promote  enhanced  automaticity 
or  triggered  arrhythmias.  Chronic  ischemia  also  results  in  downreg-
ulation  of  connexin  proteins  and  gap  junctions,  resulting  in  slowed 
impulse propagation, which is one of the factors required for reentrant 
arrhythmias. Alterations in ion channel function, either through inher-
ited mutations or through drug effect, can promote arrhythmias. QT 
prolongation  can  occur  when  the  closing  of  potassium  channels  that 
should hyperpolarize cells is delayed or slowed, or when the closing or 
inactivation of Na channels is impaired.

 ■ UNDERPINNINGS OF THE TREATMENT OF 
ARRHYTHMIAS
Pharmacologic  therapies  for  arrhythmias  are  directed  toward  the 
specific  underlying  mechanism.  For  enhanced  automaticity-based 
arrhythmia, medications that target phase 4 depolarization, including 
Ca channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers (via indirect action on 
adrenergic  input),  or  ivabradine  may  be  used.  For  triggered  activity- 
based arrhythmia, correcting the precipitating factor is most effective. 
This  includes,  among  other  therapies,  removal  of  digitalis  glycosides 
from  the  body,  removal  of  QT-prolonging  medications,  or  even 
increasing  heart  rate,  thereby  shortening  QT  interval.  For  reentrant 
arrhythmia,  medications  that  increase  the  refractory  period,  in  par-
ticular K channel blocking agents, will hence increase the wavelength 
of  conduction  beyond  the  circuit  length  of  tachycardia,  resulting  in 
inability to sustain reentry. Medications that slow conduction velocity, 
if only partially effective, may have the paradoxical effect of shorten-
ing  the  wavelength  of  tachycardia  compared  to  the  anatomic  circuit 
length,  resulting  in  a  larger  excitable  gap.  This  explains  much  of  the 

proarrhythmic effect of many antiarrhythmic medications. Therefore, 
for these agents, which typically include Na channel blockers, sufficient 
dosing  is  required  to  slow  conduction  velocity  to  the  point  of  extin-
guishing meaningful arrhythmia circuit conduction.

A  major  aspect  of  clinical  cardiac  electrophysiology  that  has 
evolved  over  several  decades  is  the  ability  to  mechanically  disrupt 
arrhythmic  substrates  through  catheter-based  (or  rarely  surgical) 
ablation. For automaticity-based arrhythmias, precise localization and 
elimination through ablation of the site of focal automaticity is effec-
tive in eliminating arrhythmia. For anatomic reentrant circuits, iden-
tifying  a  critical  zone  of  slow  conduction  that  both  sustains  reentry 
and is amenable to focused ablation and damaging that zone through 
ablation is effective for most reentrant arrhythmias. In contrast, given 
the lack of a fixed anatomic circuit, and perhaps also due to the pres-
ence of multiple, often migratory, circuits, it appears that mechanical 
disruption,  typically  through  catheter-based  ablation,  of  identified 
sites  of  functional  reentry  appears  to  be  ineffective  in  eliminating  
arrhythmia.

CARE OF THE ARRHYTHMIA PATIENT
 ■ EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS
The  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  suspected  arrhythmia  begins  with 
a  directed  history  and  physical  examination,  which  must  include  an 
ECG. The history and examination should focus on determining the 
nature of symptoms attributable to the arrhythmia itself and clues to 
potential  underlying  cardiac,  medical,  or  metabolic  conditions  that 
may predispose to specific arrhythmias, and hence direct further stud-
ies and evaluations, ultimately directing appropriate therapy, prognosis, 
and counseling. Family history may also provide clues toward possible 
inherited  arrhythmia  syndromes.  Symptoms  attributable  to  arrhyth-
mia can vary from vague sensation of fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, or 
lightheadedness to more specific sensation of rapid, slow, or irregular 
heart rate. Premature contractions, whether atrial or ventricular, may 
be sensed as extra beats, or if these extrasystoles result in diminished 
stroke  volume  for  that  particular  beat,  a  sensation  of  a  missed  beat. 
Second,  the  hemodynamic  sequelae  of  impaired  cardiac  output  may 
result in symptoms, from presyncope to frank syncope, dyspnea, chest 
discomfort, or generalized weakness. Importantly, as the cadence and 
duration of arrhythmia episodes are highly variable, the temporal man-
ifestations  of  arrhythmia  symptoms  may  vary  significantly.  Sporadic 
episodes of arrhythmia will result in intermittent symptoms, including 
syncope  if  hemodynamic  compromise  is  significant;  protracted  epi-
sodes of arrhythmia may cause persistent symptoms. In patients with 
underlying compromise in cardiac function, most typically in patients 
with  structural  heart  disease,  arrhythmia  leading  to  diminished  car-
diac  output  may  trigger  or  exacerbate  symptoms  associated  with  the 
underlying  condition  such  as  angina,  congestive  heart  failure,  or 
hypoxia-associated symptoms.

Inciting factors or associations may also provide clues to the diag-
nosis. Arrhythmias associated with activities that increase adrenergic 
tone,  such  as  exercise,  stimulant  intake,  or  emotional  stress,  may 
suggest  not  only  tachyarrhythmias  but  also  automaticity-triggered 
arrhythmias. However, keep in mind that exceptions will occur. Med-
ication use may be highly suggestive of an etiology: use of Ca channel 
blockers or beta blockers may suggest bradycardia exacerbated by these 
medications.  Medications  known  to  potentially  prolong  QT  interval 
may  suggest  a  malignant  ventricular  arrhythmia,  specifically  TdP. 
Eliciting  a  thorough  family  history,  not  only  for  known  arrhythmia 
diagnoses, but of unexplained sudden death, may point toward a heri-
table syndrome. Demographic factors may point toward or away from 
certain diagnoses. For instance, AF rarely occurs in children and young 
adults, save rare familial forms, or AF associated with structural heart 
disease; a strong male predominance, as well as a higher prevalence in 
certain ethnic populations such as Southeast Asians, is seen in Brugada 
syndrome; inappropriate sinus tachycardia is nearly exclusively a con-
dition affecting young women; degenerative conduction system disease 
leading  to  symptomatic  bradycardia  is  most  commonly  a  condition 
seen in older patients.

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular SystemArrhythmias  may  run  the  gamut  from  benign  to  malignant, 
life-threatening etiologies. Therefore, an important aspect of the eval-
uation of suspected arrhythmia is to discern patient prognosis, which 
then  informs  treatment.  Arrhythmias  that  result  in  more  significant 
hemodynamic compromise, and therefore more profound symptoms, 
tend to correlate with more malignant disease. In turn, the higher the 
suspicion for a malignant arrhythmia, the more aggressive the evalu-
ation will likely be. Loss of consciousness, which may be the result of 
cardiac arrhythmia but also other etiologies that may be more benign, 
presents  a  particularly  challenging  yet  common  diagnostic  dilemma. 
Therefore, careful thought into the appropriate evaluation for a patient 
with syncope is critical. In general, the presence of underlying struc-
tural  abnormality  of  ventricular  myocardium  favors  more  malignant 
arrhythmias,  both  due  to  the  increased  risk  of  lethal  ventricular 
arrhythmias, as well as potential inability to hemodynamically tolerate 
any particular arrhythmia.

The ECG is the cornerstone and most important diagnostic test that 
should  be  performed  on  every  patient  with  suspected  arrhythmia.  A 
12-lead resting ECG may offer clues to the diagnosis. Most simply, if 
active arrhythmia is captured on the ECG, a definitive diagnosis can 
be made. In addition, evidence suggesting underlying cardiac disease, 
such  as  prior  myocardial  infarction,  LVH  and  possible  hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, atrial disease, or baseline conduction system disease 
may  suggest  a  diagnosis.  A  subset  of  conditions  that  predispose  to 
arrhythmia,  both  inherited  or  acquired,  may  be  discerned  as  well, 
including ventricular preexcitation, prolonged or shortened QT inter-
val, or ECG findings suggestive of specific inherited conditions such as 
Brugada syndrome or right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

However,  the  ECG  typically  records  only  6  s  of  cardiac  electrical 
activity,  and  therefore  more  intermittent  and  transient  arrhythmias, 
particularly  those  not  typically  associated  with  abnormalities  on  the 
resting  ECG,  may  not  be  seen.  Many  arrhythmias,  including  forms 
of both SVT and VT, can only be diagnosed definitively if an ECG is 
performed during active arrhythmia and/or symptoms from arrhyth-
mia,  or  alternatively  provoked  in  the  electrophysiology  laboratory. 
Therefore, various forms of ambulatory monitoring may be performed 
to attempt to capture ECG activity during active arrhythmia. A grow-
ing  variety  of  monitoring  options  are  available;  the  most  appropri-
ate  option  should  be  primarily  guided  by  the  cadence  of  suspected 
arrhythmia  episodes.  For  instance,  if  daily  symptoms  occur,  a  24-  or 
48-hour continuous Holter monitor is appropriate. On the other hand, 
a  patient-activated  event  recorder  is  inappropriate  in  a  patient  with 
syncope,  as  the  arrhythmic  event  will  likely  have  passed  once  the 
patient reawakens.

Attempts at provoking arrhythmia may be warranted in the appro-
priate  circumstances.  An  ECG-monitored  treadmill  test  may  elicit 
exercise-induced arrhythmias, or if LQT is suspected, QT interval that 
fails to shorten appropriately with increased heart rate may be helpful. 
Pharmacologic  provocation  may  be  indicated  for  certain  suspected 
diagnoses, such as Brugada syndrome. Judicious and appropriate use 
of carotid sinus massage or other means to enhance vagal tone may be 
helpful to diagnose carotid hypersensitivity or overall vagally mediated 
syncope.

Tilt  table  testing  (TTT)  involves  having  a  patient  strapped  to  a 
tiltable  table.  While  monitoring  HR  and  BP,  the  patient  is  quickly 
moved  from  a  supine  to  upright  position.  In  patients  with  sus-
pected  autonomic  dysfunction-mediated  syncope  or  presyncope, 
this provocation may elicit a paradoxical vagal response, resulting in 
bradycardia and/or sinus pauses as well as hypotension, and perhaps 
frank syncope. However, given significant lack of both sensitivity and 
specificity,  the  current  role  of  TTT  is  unclear,  and  TTT  has  widely 
fallen out of favor.

Invasive electrophysiologic testing is the nearest to a gold-standard 
diagnostic  modality  for  many  arrhythmias.  Catheter-based  record-
ings of intracardiac electrograms, with or without provocative pacing 
or pharmacologic maneuvers, may elicit the clinical arrhythmia. This 
will in turn help to define the mechanism of arrhythmia. However, 
one  must  keep  in  mind  that  for  certain  arrhythmia  mechanisms, 
such  as  automaticity-driven  tachycardia,  EP  study  may  fail  to  elicit 

arrhythmia  due  to  the  often  transient  and  multifactorial  nature  of 
initiation of these arrhythmias. The nature of arrhythmia elicited will 
in  turn  aid  in  determination  of  the  patient’s  prognosis.  In  a  typical 
EP study, catheters are placed within the heart, typically via femoral 
venous access. Baseline conduction properties are measured. Provoc-
ative maneuvers including electrical pacing maneuvers, programmed 
stimulation,  and  pharmacologic  provocation  are  performed.  In  the 
modern era, the vast majority of invasive EP studies are performed in 
conjunction  with  planned  catheter  ablation,  although  programmed 
ventricular  stimulation  for  risk  stratification  of  sudden  death  may 
still  be  utilized  occasionally.  EP  study  during  catheter  ablation  is 
performed both to confirm diagnosis and localize appropriate abla-
tion target(s) but also to evaluate the efficacy of ablation performed 
during the procedure.

Depending on the suspected arrhythmia diagnosis, further testing 
may be indicated. If structural heart disease is suspected, echocardiog-
raphy is most often the best next test, as it can assess for underlying 
structural disease, evaluate LV function, and assess atrial dimensions 
and  mitral  valve  function  if  AF  is  suspected,  both  of  which  are  fair 
prognostic indicators. In patients in whom underlying coronary artery 
disease is suspected, an evaluation for coronary ischemia is indicated. 
Further  evaluation  for  underlying  structural  heart  disease  will  be 
directed based on the differential diagnosis. Cardiac CT provides broad 
diagnostic utility, depending on the scanning protocol, including evalu-
ation for ischemia, ventricular scar, anatomic evidence of CAD, congen-
ital anomalies, and left atrial anatomy. Cardiac MRI provides significant 
resolution  of  soft-tissue  characteristics  and  may  be  used  to  assess 
for ischemia, infarct, myopathy, or infiltrative disease. Cardiac PET  can 
also discern underlying ischemia, as well as metabolic/inflammatory/ 
infiltrative conditions.

TREATMENT
Cardiac Arrhythmias 

ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUG THERAPY
The  effects  of  pharmacologic  agents  on  cardiac  electrophysio-
logic properties are often complex and, in many instances, remain 
incompletely understood. The complexity is the result of complex 
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, in particular significant 
cross-reactivity  of  certain  drugs  across  different  targets  as  well 
as  variable  effects  on  drug  targets  across  drugs  within  the  same 
category.  There  are  regional  differences  in  drug  effect  within  the 
myocardium, and interpatient variations in drug metabolism play 
important roles. This has in part led to many instances of harm that 
have come from the adverse effects of many agents used over the 
years.  In  fact,  many  antiarrhythmic  agents  currently  in  use  carry 
significant  risks  of  side  effects,  some  of  which  may  be  significant 
and even lethal. Therefore, judicious use of antiarrhythmic medica-
tions by those with appropriate knowledge base and experience is 
warranted. The practical result of the narrow therapeutic index of 
this class of medications has rendered their use more and more as 
ancillary options (Table 243-2).

The  traditional  nomenclature  of  antiarrhythmic  drugs  (AADs) 
is  known  as  the  Vaughan  Williams  classification  schema.  In  this 
schema,  there  are  four  classes  (I–IV;  Table  243-2).  Class  I  AADs 
primarily target the Na channel, Class II agents target the beta- 
adrenergic  receptor,  Class  III  agents  target  potassium  channels, 
and Class IV agents target Ca channels. Class I agents are further 
subdivided  into  three  subclasses  based  on  the  kinetics  of  drug  to 
Na  channel  interactions.  Class  IA  agents,  including  procainamide 
and quinidine, possess intermediate binding kinetics and potency. 
Class IB agents, including lidocaine and mexiletine, possess rapid 
binding  kinetics  and  relatively  low  potency.  Class  IC  agents  (fle-
cainide,  propafenone)  possess  slow  kinetics  and  high  potency. 
Class II agents consist entirely of beta adrenergic blocking agents. 
Class  III  agents  (sotalol,  dofetilide,  ibutilide)  specifically  target 
the  HERG  potassium  channel  and  risk  prolongation  of  the  QT 
interval  through  effects  on  the  K  channel  (HERG)  that  in  large

larization. Class IV agents are cardioselective Ca channel blockers 
including  verapamil  and  diltiazem.  This  classification  has  signifi-
cant  limitations,  however.  Many  AADs  interact  with  multiple  ion 
channels,  and  as  a  result  many  exhibit  behavior  consistent  with 
multiple  classes.  Amiodarone,  in  particular,  exhibits  properties  of 
all AAD classes. 
CATHETER ABLATION
The rationale that underlies catheter ablation for cardiac arrhythmia 
is  that  an  anatomic  substrate  can  be  identified  and  localized,  and 
mechanical  disruption  of  that  substrate  will  eliminate  the  cardiac 
arrhythmia. For automaticity-driven arrhythmias, a focal source of 
automaticity is identified, localized, and ablated. For anatomic reen-
trant arrhythmias, a critical zone of slow conduction that sustains 
arrhythmia  and  can  be  reasonably  targeted  is  ablated.  Moreover, 
the ablation target must be in a location deemed at acceptable risk 
of  not  damaging  critical  structures  such  as  the  native  conduction 
system,  coronary  arteries,  or  epicardial  structures  including  the 
esophagus and phrenic nerve. Advances in electroanatomical map-
ping, a technology that uses alterations in electrical impedance and 
a magnetic field as measured by an intracardiac mapping catheter, 
have allowed for real-time reconstruction of cardiac chambers and 
identification of arrhythmogenic tissue to be targeted for ablation 
while  safely  avoiding  nontargeted  critical  structures.  Intracardiac 

echocardiography has also been used to enhance the safety of inva-
sive  electrophysiologic  procedures  with  real-time  visualization  of 
cardiac structures (Fig. 243-4).

In  the  1950s–1960s,  as  the  underlying  anatomic  substrates  for 
arrhythmias became better understood, open surgical disruption of 
arrhythmia circuits was the only available interventional and cura-
tive  therapy  for  many  arrhythmias.  Surgical  ligation  of  accessory 
pathways or resection of ischemic VT substrates was performed at 
specialized  surgical  centers.  The  first  attempts  at  clinical  catheter 
ablation  utilized  direct  current  (DC)  energy.  This  resulted  in  a 
jarring pulse of electrical energy that would indeed ablate cardiac 
tissue,  but  with  a  difficult-to-control  scope,  often  leading  to  sig-
nificant  complications.  Radiofrequency  (RF)  energy  was  adapted 
to  catheter-based  cardiac  ablation  in  the  1980s.  Radiofrequency 
alternating  electrical  current  (300–550  kHz)  delivered  through  a 
catheter  tip  results  in  local  tissue  heating  and  permanent  injury. 
This type of ablation is similar to the technology used in electrosur-
gical techniques using a Bovie electrocautery device. For more than  
35  years,  RF  delivery  via  catheters  has  been  iteratively  optimized 
such  that  it  has  become  the  most  common  and  mainstay  energy 
source for catheter ablation. Catheter ablation is indicated for a wide 
variety of clinical arrhythmias, including SVT, accessory pathways, 
atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, PVCs, and VT. Alternative ablative 
energy sources have been explored over the years, including light 
spectrum (laser), microwave, ultrasound, and more recently pulsed 
field electroporation, which injures targeted myocardium through 
high energy, ultra-short pulses of electrical current that disrupts the 
lipid  cell  membrane,  resulting  in  permanent  cell  death.  Recently, 
the well-established ablative technique of stereotactic (focused and 
directed) external beam ionizing radiation has been applied to the 
heart to treat various arrhythmias, including VT and AF. This par-
ticular treatment modality holds promise given its ability to target 
regions of the heart that may be inaccessible to catheters, as well as 
the  completely  noninvasive,  and  thereby  theoretically  lower  risk, 
nature of the procedure.

The most widely applied non-RF ablative energy source today is 
cryothermy, where an ablative catheter tip is cooled to a tempera-
ture range (typically below –40°C) that results in permanent tissue 
death. Cryothermy is most widely applied to ablation of paroxysmal 
atrial  ablation,  via  an  expandable  balloon  introduced  sequentially 
into each pulmonary vein and cooled to produce a circumferential 
ablative lesion at the ostium/antrum of each pulmonary vein (see 
Fig. 243-4B).

IMPLANTED ELECTRICAL DEVICE THERAPY
Implanted  cardiac  rhythm  management  devices  are  commonly 
utilized to manage arrhythmia. The first definitive pacemaker was 
implanted in 1958 and this technology has evolved to be the main-
stay in the management of bradyarrhythmias. Sinus node dysfunc-
tion or AV conduction disease, particularly with symptoms, are the 
primary  indications  for  most  implanted  pacemakers.  Pacemakers 
are  typically  implanted  percutaneously,  with  conductive/sensing 
wires,  or  leads,  inserted  through  the  upper  extremity  venous  sys-
tem  into  the  right  atrial  and/or  ventricular  myocardium,  with 
the  lead  tip  secured  to  the  myocardium  mechanically.  The  leads 
are  connected  to  a  pulse  generator  that  is  placed  typically  in  the 
prepectoral space, which contains electronic circuitry and a battery, 
allowing  sensing  and/or  delivery  of  pacing  stimuli  to  maintain 
adequate heart rate. More recently, a completely leadless pacemaker 
inserted through a large femoral venous sheath directly into the RV 
endocardium has become available. Although these devices possess 
more limited pacing options, they likely reduce the risks associated 
with transvenous lead systems, including infection or lead fracture 
requiring extraction.

Implanted cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are placed in a sim-
ilar fashion to pacemakers. However, ICDs have the ability to sense 
abnormal ventricular arrhythmias and deliver either antitachycar-
dia  pacing  or  defibrillation  to  prevent  sudden  death.  In  patients 
who experience a potentially lethal VA, ICD therapy may be lifesav-
ing. Indications for ICD therapy are considered for either primary 
prevention  of  sudden  cardiac  death  (SCD)  due  to  arrhythmia  in 
an at-risk patient, or as secondary prevention in a patient who has 
survived an SCD event. More recently, a completely subcutaneous 
ICD system has become available, avoiding intravenous leads that 
increase risk for systemic infection, and potentially the procedure 
to extract a potentially fibrosed lead in cases of lead malfunction or 
endovascular infection.

244 The Bradyarrhythmias: 
Disorders of the  
Sinoatrial Node
William H. Sauer, Bruce A. Koplan

The sinoatrial (SA) node serves as the natural pacemaker of the heart 
and has variable rates in response to parasympathetic and sympathetic 
stimulation. If the sinus node is dysfunctional or suppressed a subsid-
iary pacemaker in the atrioventricular node or specialized conduction 
system  will  take  over  leading  to  a  slower  junctional  or  ventricular 
rhythm.  Symptoms  of  sinus  node  dysfunction  can  vary  but  typically 
present  as  fatigue,  exercise  intolerance,  or  dyspnea.  The  diagnostic 
evaluation  includes  an  investigation  into  reversible  causes  of  sinus 
bradycardia,  confirmation  of  sinus  node  dysfunction  with  outpatient

telemetry monitoring or exercise testing, and possibly cardiac imaging 
if  structural  heart  disease  is  suspected.  Once  irreversible  sinus  node 
dysfunction  is  confirmed,  permanent  pacemaker  implantation  is  the 
only reliable therapy for symptomatic bradycardia.

 ■ STRUCTURE AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SA NODE
The SA node region is rather complex in structure. Clusters of myocytes 
with pacemaker activity are surrounded by fibroblasts, endothelial cells, 
and transitional cells. These clusters of small fusiform cells in the sulcus 
terminalis on the epicardial surface of the heart at the right atrial–supe-
rior vena caval junction envelop the SA nodal artery. The SA node is 
structurally heterogeneous, but the central prototypic nodal cells have 
fewer distinct myofibrils than does the surrounding atrial myocardium, 
no  intercalated  disks  visible  on  light  microscopy,  a  poorly  developed 
sarcoplasmic  reticulum,  and  no  T  tubules.  Cells  in  the  peripheral 
regions of the SA node are transitional in both structure and function. 
The SA nodal artery arises from the right coronary artery in 55–60% 
and the left circumflex artery in 40–45% of persons. This feature along 
with a protective extracellular matrix of connective tissue insulates the 
SA  node  from  the  hyperpolarizing  influence  of  the  larger  atrium.  In 
addition, the alignment of this complex matrix is associated with nearly 
unidirectional electrical propagation to the atrium (Fig. 244-1).

Pacemaker cells spontaneously depolarize in a continuous manner 
setting the natural rate of depolarization and myocardial contraction. 
Action potential depolarization in the SA node is normally at a resting 
rate  of  60–100  beats/min.  The  autonomic  nervous  system  exhibits 
control  over  the  sinus  node,  with  a  preponderance  of  parasympa-
thetic  innervation  at  baseline.  Removal  of  parasympathetic  tone  or 
an increase in sympathetic innervation leads to an increase in rate of 
depolarization. In denervated hearts, the rate of electrical depolariza-
tion (intrinsic heart rate) is approximately 100 beats/min, reflecting the 
rate of automaticity of the sinus node uninhibited by parasympathetic 
tone. The complement of ionic currents present in nodal cells results 
in a less negative resting membrane potential compared with atrial or 
ventricular myocytes. Electrical diastole in nodal cells is characterized 
by slow diastolic depolarization (phase 4), which generates an action 
potential  as  the  membrane  voltage  reaches  threshold.  The  action 
potential upstrokes (phase 0) are slow compared with atrial or ventric-
ular myocytes, being mediated by calcium rather than sodium current.
Cells with properties of SA nodal tissue are electrically connected to 
the remainder of the myocardium by cells with an electrophysiologic 
phenotype between that of nodal cells and that of atrial or ventricular 
myocytes. Cells in the SA node exhibit the most rapid phase 4 depo-
larization and thus are the dominant pacemakers in a normal heart.

Myocytes  within  the  SA  node  complex  include  specialized  cells 
surrounded by fibrous tissue. Unlike atrial and ventricular cells, sinus 
node pacemaker cells have no true resting potential, but instead depo-
larize automatically and repetitively after the end of an action potential, 
and the depolarizing current in the SA node myocytes results primarily 
from slow calcium currents instead of fast sodium channels, which are 
absent  in  SA  node  cells.  Spontaneous  phase  4  depolarization  results 
from  a  combination  of  slow  inward  depolarizing  sodium  currents  
(if, “funny currents”), along with T-type and L-type calcium channels. 
The  upstroke  of  depolarization  in  SA  node  myocytes  is  slower  and 
lower in amplitude than in ventricular myocytes.

In patients <85 years of age, the resting heart rate is strongly influ-
enced by parasympathetic tone at baseline. Absence or elimination of 
autonomic influence on the SA node leads to an intrinsic heart rate that 
is normally 100–110 beats/min. The myocytes within the SA node that 
initiate  pacing  change  with  different  rates.  A  superior  shift  occurs  at 
higher heart rates and an inferior shift at lower heart rates, which may 
lead to a slightly different P wave inscribed on ECGs recorded during 
different rates of sinus rhythm.

In  addition,  a  progressive  decline  in  maximum  heart  rate  occurs 
with age, although the resting heart rate normally remains unchanged. 
Intrinsic  heart  rate  declines  5–6  beats/min  for  each  decade  of  age. 
However, the constancy of resting heart rate is associated with a grad-
ual decrease in parasympathetic tone and a transition to predominant 
sympathetic tone by the ninth decade.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS OF SA NODAL DISEASE
Intrinsic sinus node disease is sometimes referred to as sick sinus syn-
drome or sinus node dysfunction (SND) and can manifest as fatigue, 
exercise  intolerance,  or  syncope  resulting  from  either  reduced  heart 
rate  or  pauses.  Electrocardiographic  recording  plays  a  central  role  in 
the diagnosis and management of SA node dysfunction. The correla-
tion  between  symptoms  and  slow  heart  rate  or  pauses  is  essential  in 

determining  whether  bradycardia  may  be  considered  pathologic  and 
necessitating  intervention.  Baseline  ECG  can  detect  baseline  sinus 
bradycardia  but  may  not  indicate  symptom  correlation  in  certain 
settings.  To  address  the  limitations  of  the  resting  ECG,  longer-term 
recording employing mobile telemetry devices such as Holter monitors 
or  mobile  cardiac  telemetry  can  also  be  helpful  in  correlating  symp-
toms with rate abnormalities (Fig. 244-2).

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular SystemIn  addition,  commercially  available  wearable  devices,  such  as 
watches with electrocardiographic recording capabilities, can also have 
excellent fidelity electrograms that may also be utilized. Contemporary 
event  monitors  may  be  automatically  triggered  to  record  the  ECG 
when certain programmed heart rate criteria are met and implantable 
monitors  permit  very  long-term  recording  (years)  in  particularly 
challenging  patients.  Treadmill  testing  can  be  utilized  to  assess  for 
maximum heart rate. It is worth noting, however, that standard Bruce 
protocol treadmill testing may be helpful in detecting abnormalities in 
maximum heart rate, but more insidious chronotropic incompetence 
that  manifests  as  abnormalities  of  rate  increase  during  submaximal 
exercise may be more evident with treadmill protocols that have more 
gradual effort increases.

Once there is evidence of sinus node dysfunction, it is important to 
rule out reversible causes of resting sinus bradycardia or chronotropic 
incompetence.  Table  244-1  lists  the  potentially  reversible  causes  of 
sinus  node  disease  and  includes  hypothyroidism  and  rate-slowing 
medications. Many patients with sleep apnea will have high vagal tone 
during  sleep  and  especially  during  apneic  events.  Sinus  bradycardia 
and  sinus  pauses  frequently  are  seen  if  a  patient  is  being  monitored 
during this period. Sleep apnea, a common reversible cause, should be 
suspected if marked sinus bradycardia and prolonged sinus pauses are 
observed in a telemetry monitoring period during sleep.

If structural heart disease is suspected, transthoracic echocardiogra-
phy should be used to detect potential cardiac abnormalities associated 
with sinus node dysfunction (Fig. 244-3). Advanced cardiac imaging 
is  indicated  for  evaluation  of  possible  myocardial  diseases  such  as 
amyloidosis,  infiltrative  cardiomyopathy,  or  myocarditis.  Invasive 
electrophysiology testing solely to assess sinus node function is rarely 
utilized  beyond  the  noninvasive  techniques  mentioned.  In  patients 
who  are  also  undergoing  electrophysiology  studies  (EPS)  for  other 
indications, evaluation of sinus node function as part of the EPS may 
be considered. In symptomatic patients with suspected SND, EPS may 
rarely be considered when the diagnosis remains uncertain and after 
initial noninvasive evaluation is inconclusive. Investigation of the sinus 
node during EPS can consist of determination of sinus node recovery 
time (SNRT) and sinoatrial conduction time (SACT). In addition, the 
intrinsic heart rate [118.1 – (0.57 × age)] can be assessed via pharma-
cologic blockade of autonomic tone with intravenous propranolol and 
atropine. EPS is not widely used, however, as there is no evidence that 
abnormal SNRT or SACT alone can be used as an indication for per-
manent pacing (PPM). There is no indication for EPS in asymptomatic 
patients with sinus bradycardia.

 ■ SA NODAL DYSFUNCTION SUBTYPES
SND  can  be  categorized  into  problems  with  impulse  formation  and 
problems with impulse conduction. The term sick sinus syndrome may 
be used interchangeably with SND and refers to a group of related con-
ditions comprising problems of both impulse formation and impulse 
conduction.

Sinus Node Exit Block (See Fig. 244-4) 
“Sinus arrest” results 
from  failure  of  impulse  formation  within  the  sinus  node.  Sinoatrial 
exit block results from failure of sinus node activity to propagate to the 
atrium. Sinoatrial exit block can have similar pattern characteristics of 
types of AV node block. It can manifest as complete SA block. Type I 
SA block involves fixed delay out of the sinus node. Type II SA block 
can occur with either progressive delay and then intermittent failure to 
propagate to the atrium (Mobitz I type) or fixed delay with intermittent 
failure to conduct (Mobitz II). The mass of the sinus node is not large 
enough to have an appearance on the ECG. Instead, the P waves that 
result from atrial depolarization can provide information that reflects 
the health of the sinus node. Type II second-degree SA block can be 
inferred  on  the  ECG  if  the  sinus  rate  abruptly  transitions  to  a  sinus 
rate that is half the previous rate (every other sinus depolarization is 
blocked  from  exiting  to  the  atrium).  Sinoatrial  Wenckebach  can  be 
inferred from the ECG in the setting of progressive shortening of the 
P-P  interval  leading  up  to  a  sinus  pause.  This  is  due  to  progressive 
prolongation of sinoatrial conduction, but to a lesser extent with each 
successive prolongation. This is similar to the typical progressive short-
ening of the R-R interval that is observed with AV nodal Wenckebach. 
Other types of SA block require invasive EPS to decipher. The exercise 
of  determining  the  type  of  SA  block  with  invasive  electrophysiology 
testing is typically not necessary because it does not alter management.

Tachy-Brady  Syndrome  Tachycardia-bradycardia  (tachy-brady) 
syndrome  is  a  subset  of  sick  sinus  syndrome/sinus  node  disease  that 
consists  of  high  heart  rates  (most  commonly  atrial  fibrillation)  with 
alternating  symptomatic  bradycardia  or  offset  pauses  (Fig.  244-5). 
Commonly, medications that are needed for rate control of tachycardia 
exacerbate bradycardia episodes, and thus the presence of tachy-brady 
syndrome is often a reason to consider pacemaker implantation.

Chronotropic  Incompetence  Chronotropic  incompetence  (CI) 
is  broadly  defined  as  the  inability  of  the  heart  to  increase  its  rate  to 
meet activity or demand. Compared to an increase stroke volume, the 
increase in heart rate is a stronger contributor to the increase in oxygen 
uptake (VO2) during aerobic exercise. Therefore, CI can be associated 
with  severe  exercise  intolerance  and  increased  cardiovascular  events 
and  overall  morality.  CI  can  take  many  forms  including  failure  to 
achieve a maximum heart rate [208 – (0.7 × age)], heart rate instability 
with exercise, or failure to achieve submaximal heart rate. Due to this

FIGURE 244-3  Evaluation of bradycardia and conduction disease. In patients with sinus node dysfunction, reversible causes should be identified and eliminated when 
possible. If no reversible cause can be identified, structural heart disease should be considered and evaluated for, if appropriate. If no symptoms are present, an observation 
strategy is appropriate. In patients who are symptomatic, further evaluation with ambulatory monitoring or exercise testing to identify symptom-rhythm correlation should 
be considered. (Reproduced with permission from FM Kusumoto et al: 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and

latter category, standard exercise testing can, at times, fail to recognize 
a  patient  with  CI  as  some  patients  can  achieve  an  appropriate  maxi-
mum heart rate but may exhibit heart rate instability. Ambulatory heart 
rate monitoring along with a diary can be helpful to correlate symp-
toms with abnormally slow heart rates. Because CI can be insidious and 
multiple definitions exist, it can be easily overlooked.
Sinus  Node  Fibrosis  Clinical  SND  is  most  common  in  older 
adults.  This  is  due  to  normally  occurring  age-associated  increase  in 
fibrotic tissue in the SA node, which can exacerbate any degree of SND. 
A loss of pacemaker cells in the sinus node is also seen with age. It is 
worth  noting,  however,  that  while  increased  fibrosis  in  the  SA  node 
and decreased numbers of pacemaker myocytes are part of a normal 
process of aging, SND is pathologic and there are many elderly patients 
with extensive fibrosis and normal heart rate.
SA  Nodal  Ischemia  and  Infarction  Sinus  bradycardia  is  com-
mon  in  patients  with  acute  inferior  or  posterior  MI  and  can  be 

exacerbated  by  increased  vagal  tone  (Bezold-Jarisch  reflex)  or  with 
the use of drugs such as morphine and beta blockers. Ischemia of the 
SA  nodal  artery  probably  occurs  in  acute  coronary  syndromes  more 
typically  with  involvement  with  the  right  coronary  artery,  and  even 
with infarction, the effect on SA node function most often is transient. 
However,  there  are  rare  cases  where  sinoatrial  infarction  can  affect 
sinus  node  function.  One  potential  complication  of  atrial  fibrillation 
ablation is the inadvertent injury to the SA nodal artery that may be 
coursing  over  a  targeted  ablation  region  in  the  right  and  left  atrium. 
SND and arrest have been described following ablation of atrial fibril-
lation and flutter.

Carotid  Sinus  Hypersensitivity  and  Neurally  Mediated

with the cardioinhibitory variant of vasovagal syncope. Carotid hyper-

1878 predominant  cardioinhibitory  component  responds  to  pacemaker 
implantation. The vasodepressor effect of the enhanced vagal tone is 
unaffected  by  the  pacing  support,  but  the  lack  of  bradycardia  often 
prevents  injury  with  this  subtype  of  vasovagal  syncope.  Several  ran-
domized  trials  have  investigated  the  efficacy  of  permanent  pacing  in 
patients  with  drug-refractory  vasovagal  syncope,  with  mixed  results. 
Although  initial  trials  suggested  that  patients  undergoing  pacemaker 
implantation have fewer recurrences and a longer time to recurrence 
of symptoms, at least one follow-up study did not confirm these results.

TREATMENT
SA Nodal Disease 

TEMPORARY PACING FOR TRANSIENT SUPPORT
In symptomatic patients presenting with sinus node disease, remov-
ing any possible reversible cause remains the initial strategy. Acute 
myocardial  infarction,  electrolyte  abnormalities,  medications,  and 
hypothyroidism  should  all  be  considered  as  potentially  reversible 
causes. Unnecessary medications that may be causing bradycardia 
should be eliminated. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and 
digoxin are some of the more common medications in use that may 
case bradycardia. These drugs may have a wide range of indications 
in patients after MI and with chronic systolic dysfunction. If stop-
ping the medication or decreasing the dose is an option, this should 
be tried first. If the medication is felt to be essential in patient man-
agement, a pacemaker may be indicated.

In  patients  with  tachy-brady  syndrome,  alleviation  of  the 
tachycardia,  whether  it  is  atrial  fibrillation  or  other  forms  of 
supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, can prevent bradycardia events. 
Treatment of the tachycardia can sometimes be accomplished with 
antiarrhythmic drug therapy or catheter ablation. If this cannot be 
achieved, permanent pacing may be necessary.

Hypoxia from decrease in blood flow to the SA node, which can 
occur  with  cardiac  ischemia  or  MI,  can  lead  to  slowing  of  phase 
4  depolarization  and  resultant  bradycardia.  Further  ischemia  and 
necrosis of pacemaker cells can cause irreversible sinus node dis-
ease. On occasion, reversal of ischemia with revascularization can 
alleviate  bradycardia.  Sinus  pauses  in  the  setting  of  tachy-brady 
syndrome may be eliminated if atrial tachyarrhythmias can be suc-
cessfully treated. It is also important to recognize when bradycardia 
may be transient. Acute illness associated with episodes of extreme 
vagal tone may lead to transient SA node abnormalities. Typically 
this may be observed as sinus slowing, followed by transient sinus 
arrest and/or AV block. Although a pacemaker may be needed in 
extreme instances of prolonged arrest, recovery from the acute ill-
ness may make the pacemaker unnecessary in follow-up.

Sinus  bradycardia  is  often  observed  after  heart  transplantation 
and cardiac surgery. In the case of heart transplantation, this may 
be because of accumulated amiodarone that affects the donor heart 
or ischemic injury to the SA node upon transplantation. If the SA 
nodal artery is injured at the time of right atriotomy during cardiac 
surgery, sinus arrest with junctional rhythm may be observed. Tem-
porary  pacing  or  pharmacologic  support  with  beta-1  adrenergic 
agonists may be needed in these circumstances while awaiting SA 
nodal recovery.

In  addition,  sinus  bradycardia  and  sinus  pauses  are  common 
after spinal cord injury. The mechanism of bradycardia is enhanced 
parasympathetic  tone  and  autonomic  dysreflexia.  Common  trig-
gers  can  be  tracheal  suctioning  and  turning  the  patient.  Atropine 
and  inotropes  have  shown  mixed  success.  Adenosine  blockade 
with  theophylline  or  aminophylline  can  sometimes  be  successful. 
Temporary and sometimes permanent pacing may be necessary in 
extreme circumstances. 
PERMANENT PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION
Pacing  in  SA  nodal  disease  is  indicated  to  alleviate  symptoms  of 
bradycardia.  Consensus  guidelines  published  by  the  American 
Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/

Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) outline the indications for the use of 
pacemakers  and  categorize  them  by  class  based  on  levels  of  evi-
dence  (Fig.  244-6).  Since  the  first  implementation  of  permanent 
pacing in the 1950s, many advances in technology have resulted in 
miniaturization, increased longevity of pulse generators, improve-
ment  in  leads,  and  increased  functionality.  To  better  understand 
pacemaker therapy for bradycardias, it is important to be familiar 
with the fundamentals of pacemaker function.

There is no established heart rate below which pacemaker treat-
ment is indicated (Table 244-2). Well-conditioned athletes can have 
resting sinus rates well below 40 beats/min, and some individuals 
can have similar levels of bradycardia during sleep. Permanent pac-
ing is typically not indicated for sleep-related pauses felt secondary 
to high vagal tone in the absence of other symptoms. Asymptomatic 
sinus  bradycardia  has  not  been  associated  with  adverse  outcomes 
and  does  not  typically  warrant  permanent  pacing.  In  situations 
such  as  asymptomatic  sinus  bradycardia,  sinus  pauses  secondary 
to physiologically elevated parasympathetic tone, transient pauses 
during  sleep,  or  asymptomatic  SND  where  symptoms  have  been 
documented to occur in the absence of bradycardia, a pacemaker is 
generally not indicated.

Medications  to  improve  heart  rate  in  order  to  avoid  PPM  are 
very  rarely  utilized.  Medications  such  as  methylxanthines  (e.g., 
theophylline)  are  sometimes  utilized  on  a  temporary  basis  when 
a pacemaker may need to be delayed due to unique circumstances 
such as active infection. In addition, oral theophylline may be con-
sidered to determine if an increase in heart rate is associated with 
improvement  in  symptoms  in  a  patient  with  sinus  bradycardia  to 
suggest that a PPM may be beneficial. This latter strategy is rarely 
utilized in more equivocal situations.

PPM is the principal treatment for sinus node dysfunction and 
the decision to pursue this treatment is largely driven by a correla-
tion between symptoms and bradycardia. The stronger the correla-
tion between symptoms and bradycardia, the greater the likelihood 
of improvement. PPM is most commonly achieved through trans-
venous implantation of one or more leads through the left or right 
subclavian veins into the cardiac chambers. The leads are attached 
to  a  pacemaker  generator  that  is  placed  subcutaneously  in  the 
pectoral chest region. Less commonly, pacing leads can be placed 
in the epicardium via surgical approaches including sternotomy or 
thoracotomy. This latter approach can be accomplished as a stand-
alone procedure but is more commonly performed concomitantly 
during another primary cardiac surgery. Leadless pacemakers that 
are totally self-contained pacing devices can also be placed in the 
right  ventricle  to  provide  ventricular-based  pacing.  Some  leadless 
pacemakers can also incorporate technology to sense atrial activity 
to  attempt  to  coordinate  atrial  sensing  with  ventricular  pacing. 
Currently, leadless pacemakers are only available for implant in the 
right ventricle. Although these devices can sense atrial activity and 
coordinate  this  with  ventricular  pacing  (A-V  synchrony),  if  atri-
al-based pacing is desired, a transvenous or epicardial atrial pacing 
lead is required.

A  standard  nomenclature  for  pacing  mode  programming  uti-
lizes  a  four-letter  code.  The  first  letter  indicates  the  chamber(s) 
paced (O, none; A, atrium; V, ventricular; D, dual; S, single). The 
second  letter  indicates  the  chamber(s)  sensed.  The  third  letter  is 
the response to a sensed event (O, none; I, inhibited; T, triggered; 
D, inhibition and triggered). The fourth letter refers to whether rate 
response  (R)  is  turned  on.  Therefore  a  dual-chamber  pacemaker 
programmed  in  a  DDDR  mode  provides  atrial  and  ventricular 
pacing, A and V sensing, can be inhibited or triggered by a sensed 
beat, and is programmed to provide rate responsiveness to activity 
via  either  a  built-in  accelerometer,  minute  ventilation  sensor,  or 
both. Rate response is essential for the treatment of CI as it attempts 
to mimic the natural physiologic increase in heart rate in response 
to exertion.

A  single-chamber  atrial  pacemaker  can  be  a  consideration  in 
patients with pure sinus node dysfunction who are felt to be at low 
risk for developing AV nodal block. However, fibrosis of the sinus

dysfunction,  a  majority  of  patients  receiving  a  pacemaker  for 
sinus  node  disease  (particularly  older  individuals)  often  receive 
a  dual-chamber  pacemaker  with  backup  ventricular  pacing  if   
needed.

Class  I  indications  for  pacing  in  SA  node  dysfunction  include 
documented symptomatic bradycardia, SND-associated long-term 
drug  therapy  for  which  there  is  no  alternative,  and  symptomatic 
CI. Class IIa indications include those outlined previously in which 
SND  is  suspected  but  not  documented  and  for  syncope  of  unex-
plained origin in the presence of major abnormalities of SA node 
dysfunction. Mildly symptomatic individuals with heart rates con-
sistently <40 beats/min constitute a class IIb indication for pacing. 
Pacing is not indicated in patients with SA node dysfunction who 
do not have symptoms and in those in whom bradycardia is associ-
ated with the use of nonessential drugs.

COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO PACEMAKER 
IMPLANTATION
Although  pacemakers  are  highly  reliable,  they  are  subject  to  a 
number  of  complications  related  to  implantation  and  electronic 
function.  In  adults,  permanent  pacemakers  are  most  commonly 
implanted with access to the heart by way of the subclavian superior 
vena cava venous system. Rare, but possible, acute complications of 
transvenous pacemaker implantation include infection, hematoma, 
pneumothorax,  cardiac  perforation,  diaphragmatic/phrenic  nerve 
stimulation,  and  lead  dislodgment.  Limitations  of  chronic  pace-
maker therapy include infection, erosion, lead failure, and abnor-
malities resulting from inappropriate programming or interaction 
with the patient’s native electrical cardiac function. Rotation of the 
pacemaker pulse generator in its subcutaneous pocket, either inten-
tionally or inadvertently, often referred to as “twiddler’s syndrome,” 
can wrap the leads around the generator and produce dislodgment 
with failure to sense or pace the heart. The small size and light weight 
of contemporary pacemakers make this a rare complication. Trans-
venous  leads  are  considered  the  least  reliable  component  of  per-
manent pacing systems. Enhancements in battery technology and 
component design have produced a pacing system small enough to 
be implanted in the heart without the need for a transvenous lead. 
The first “leadless” pacemakers were only appropriate for patients 
with  indications  for  single-chamber  ventricular  (right  ventricle) 
pacing. More recently these devices have been modified to detect 
mechanical atrial contraction, and thus can be programmed to pre-
serve AV synchrony in patients with heart block but without SND.

245 The Bradyarrhythmias: 
Disorders of the 
Atrioventricular Node
William H. Sauer, Bruce A. Koplan

Impulses  generated  in  the  sinoatrial  (SA)  node  are  conducted  to  the 
ventricles through the electrically and anatomically complex atrioven-
tricular  (AV)  node.  The  AV  node  is  specialized  for  slow  conduction 
of the action potential to create a delay between atrial and ventricular 
activation. There is a similar pattern of arrangement of gap junctions 
and expression of connexins in the AV node as in the sinus node. This 
allows  for  weak  electrical  coupling  in  the  center  of  the  node  to  slow 
conduction  and  protect  it  from  the  periphery.  This  unique  arrange-
ment of gap junctions, along with extracellular matrix and fibroblasts, 
and  a  lack  of  conductance  in  adjacent  valvular  tissue  allow  the  AV 
node to slow conduction and serve as the electrical “gatekeeper” to the 
ventricle.

As described in previous chapters, cells located in the AV node sit at 
a relatively higher resting membrane potential than surrounding atrial 

and  ventricular  myocytes,  exhibit  spontaneous  depolarization  during 
phase 4 of the action potential, and have slower phase 0 depolarization 
(mediated by calcium influx in nodal tissue with a lack of the type of 
fast sodium channels found in atrial and ventricular myocytes) com-
pared to ventricular tissue (mediated by sodium influx). Although the 
AV node has the potential for pacemaker activity, the normal automa-
ticity rate is 20–60 beats/min, which is overridden by the higher intrin-
sic rate of the SA node (60–100 beats/min). Therefore, the AV node can 
provide backup heart rate when the SA node fails to depolarize. There 
is a progressive decrease in the frequency of spontaneous depolariza-
tion down the His and Purkinje fibers. This progressive decrease in rate 
of  depolarization  allows  for  unidirectional  flow  of  impulses  through 
the conduction system.

Bradycardia  may  occur  when  conduction  across  the  AV  node  is 
compromised,  resulting  in  slow  ventricular  rates.  The  consequences 
can be fatigue, syncope, and, if a reliable escape rhythm does not occur, 
death. Transient AV conduction block is common in the young and is 
most likely the result of high vagal tone found in up to 10% of young 
adults.  Acquired  and  persistent  failure  of  AV  conduction  is  rare  in 
healthy adult populations, with an estimated incidence of 1 per 5000 
in the U.S. population per year. In the setting of myocardial ischemia, 
aging and fibrosis, or cardiac infiltrative diseases, however, persistent 
AV  block  is  much  more  common.  As  with  symptomatic  bradycardia 
arising from SA node dysfunction, permanent pacing is the only reli-
able therapy for symptoms arising from AV conduction block.

STRUCTURE AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE AV 
NODE
The  normal  AV  junctional  area  can  be  divided  into  a  transition  cell 
zone (which results from approaches from the atrium to the AV node), 
the  compact  AV  node,  and  the  penetrating  part  of  the  His  bundle. 
Conduction from the SA node to the AV node occurs in a preferential 
manner via intra-atrial pathways with higher conduction velocity than 
the remainder of atrial tissue. The AV node itself is a small region (~1 × 
3 × 5 mm) that lies beneath the right atrial endocardium at the apex of 
the triangle of Koch, a region defined by three landmarks: the coronary 
sinus ostium posteriorly, the septal tricuspid valve annulus anteriorly, 
and  the  tendon  of  Todaro  superiorly.  The  AV  node  can  be  further 
subdivided  into  the  lower  nodal  bundle  and  compact  node.  A  right-
ward inferior node extension spreads along the tricuspid valve toward 
the  coronary  sinus,  and  the  leftward  nodal  extension  spreads  from 
the compact node along the tendon of Todaro. In some people, there  
are two functional pathways in the AV node: a slow pathway located in 
the inferior node extension and a fast pathway that is less well defined 
but  is  superior  to  the  slow  pathway.  The  role  of  these  pathways  in 
supraventricular tachycardia is described in another chapter.

The  compact  AV  node  continues  anteriorly  and  superiorly  as  the 
penetrating AV bundle where it traverses the central fibrous body in 
close  proximity  to  the  aortic,  mitral,  and  tricuspid  valve  annuli.  The 
penetrating  AV  bundle  continues  through  the  annulus  fibrosis  and 
emerges as the His bundle along the ventricular septum. The right bun-
dle branch (RBB) emerges from the distal AV bundle and terminates to 
a band that traverses the right ventricle (moderator band). In contrast, 
the left bundle branch (LBB) is a broad subendocardial sheet of tissue 
on the septal left ventricle. The Purkinje fiber network emerges from 
the RBB and LBB and extensively ramifies on the endocardial surfaces 
of the right and left ventricles, respectively.

The  cells  that  constitute  the  AV  node  complex  are  heterogeneous 
with a range of action potential profiles. The AV junction has distinct 
regions including a transitional cell zone (atrionodal cells), the com-
pact AV node, and the cells of the penetrating part of the His bundle. 
In the transitional zones, the cells have an electrical phenotype between 
those  of  atrial  myocytes  and  cells  of  the  compact  node.  Atrionodal 
transitional  connections  exhibit  decremental  conduction,  defined  as 
slowing  of  conduction  with  increasingly  rapid  rates  of  stimulation. 
Myocytes  that  constitute  the  compact  AV  node  are  similar  to  sinus 
node  myocytes,  having  a  resting  membrane  potential  of  ~–60  mV; 
exhibit action potentials with low amplitudes, slow upstrokes of phase 0

high-input  resistance  and  relative  insensitivity  to  external  [K+].  The 
action  potential  phenotype  is  explained  by  the  complement  of  ionic 
currents expressed. AV nodal cells lack a robust inward rectifier potas-
sium current (IK1) and fast sodium current (INa); L-type calcium current 
(ICa-L) is responsible for phase 0; and phase 4 depolarization reflects the 
composite  activity  of  the  depolarizing  currents—funny  current  (If), 
ICa-L,  T-type  calcium  current  (ICa-T),  and  sodium  calcium  exchanger 
current  (INCX)—and  the  repolarizing  currents—delayed  rectifier  (IKr) 
and acetylcholine-gated (IKACh) potassium currents. Electrical coupling 
between  cells  in  the  AV  node  is  tenuous  due  to  the  relatively  sparse 
expression of gap junction channels (predominantly connexin-40) and 
increased extracellular volume.

The His bundle and the bundle branches are insulated from ventric-
ular myocardium. The most rapid conduction in the heart is observed 
in  Purkinje  cells  (1–3  m/s),  with  action  potentials  exhibiting  a  very 
rapid  upstroke  (phase  0),  prolonged  plateau  (phase  2),  and  modest 
automaticity (phase 4 depolarization). Gap junctions, composed largely 
of  connexin-40,  are  abundant,  but  bundles  are  not  connected  trans-
versely to ventricular myocardium. The AV node is innervated by both 
sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic input that can either slow 
or enhance conduction.

The blood supply to the penetrating AV bundle is from the AV nodal 
artery and first septal perforator of the left anterior descending coro-
nary artery. The AV node artery arises from the right coronary artery 
(80–90%  of  the  time)  or  the  left  circumflex  (10%)  with  the  assigned 
artery  associated  with  the  dominance  of  the  coronary  artery  circu-
lation.  The  bundle  branches  also  have  a  dual  blood  supply  from  the 
septal perforators of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LBB 
and proximal RBB) and branches of the posterior descending coronary 
artery. The AV node is highly innervated with postganglionic sympa-
thetic  and  parasympathetic  nerves;  however,  the  bundle  of  His  and 
distal conducting system are minimally influenced by autonomic tone.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC DEFINITIONS 
OF AV CONDUCTION BLOCK (TABLE 245-1)
Conduction block in the AV node is classified based on the appearance 
on electrocardiography (ECG), which may also be a reflection of the 
location of block along the AV conduction axis. First-degree AV block 
involves  a  fixed  prolongation  of  the  PR  interval  (>200  ms).  In  first- 
degree AV block, delay usually occurs within the AV node, although the 
atria, His bundle, and Purkinje system may also be involved. Although 
the  term  block  is  a  misnomer  of  sorts  because  electrical  conduction 
is  delayed  and  not  interrupted,  it  remains  in  use.  Second-degree  AV 
block involves intermittent failure of conduction between the atrium 
and ventricle. There are two subtypes of second-degree AV block. Type 
I (Mobitz I, Wenckebach) AV block manifests as progressive prolonga-
tion of the PR interval prior to one or more “dropped” QRS complexes. 
Progressive shortening of the RR interval and “grouped beating” QRS 
complexes  are  classically  seen  in  Mobitz  I  AV  block.  In  addition,

comparison of the last PR interval before and the first PR interval after 
the dropped QRS complex will often reveal the greatest discrepancy of 
PR interval, making the diagnosis of Mobitz I AV block most evident. 
Mobitz I AV block typically involves the AV node, is hemodynamically 
stable,  and  in  the  absence  of  symptoms,  does  not  typically  require 
pacing.  Type  II  second-degree  AV  block  manifests  on  ECG  as  failed 
AV conduction preceded by fixed PR interval (no prolongation of PR 
interval prior to a dropped beat). Type II block has more serious impli-
cations, including a risk of sudden death. It is infranodal in location 
and associated with a less reliable escape rhythm. Permanent pacing is 
required. In the setting of 2:1 AV block, ECG differentiation of type I 
versus type II block is not possible. If the PR interval is <160 ms prior 
to the AV conduction and QRS is wider than normal, infranodal (type 
II)  block  is  most  likely.  Complete  heart  block  (third-degree  block) 
involves complete AV dissociation with a ventricular rate that is slower 
than the atrial rate (Fig. 245-1).

In  the  absence  of  a  preexisting  bundle  branch  block,  a  wide  QRS 
escape  rhythm  implies  a  block  in  the  distal  His  or  bundle  branches; 
in contrast, a narrow QRS rhythm implies a block in the AV node or 
proximal  His  and  an  escape  rhythm  originating  in  the  AV  junction. 
Narrow QRS escape rhythms are typically faster and more stable than 
wide  QRS  escape  rhythms  and  originate  more  proximally  in  the  AV 
conduction system.

ETIOLOGY OF AV CONDUCTION DISEASE
There are numerous causes of intrinsic AV node dysfunction. Fibrosis 
and sclerosis of the conduction system are the most common causes 
of  acquired  conduction  disease,  accounting  for  ~50%  of  AV  block. 
Numerous  conditions  that  may  not  be  distinguishable  from  one 
another  can  lead  to  conduction  system  fibrosis.  Senile  degeneration 
of  the  conduction  system  is  most  commonly  seen  in  the  elderly  and 
results from idiopathic fibrosis and calcification. Lev’s disease results 
from  proximal  bundle  branch  fibrosis.  Lenègre’s  disease  results  from 
a  sclerodegenerative  process  that  occurs  in  a  younger  age  group  and 
involves the more distal portions of the bundle branches. Calcification 
of  the  aortic  valve  annulus  can  encroach  on  the  conduction  system. 
Compared to aortic valve calcification, mitral calcification is less com-
monly a cause of AV block (Table 245-2).

 ■ IATROGENIC CAUSES
AV  block  may  also  be  from  iatrogenic  causes.  Cardiac  surgery,  most 
commonly  cardiac  valve  surgery,  can  result  in  damage  to  the  AV 
conduction  system,  with  the  highest  risk  occurring  in  aortic  valve 
and  tricuspid  valve  surgery.  Percutaneous  transcatheter  aortic  valve 
replacement, septal myectomy, and alcohol septal ablation also carry a 
risk of AV block. Percutaneous catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmias, 
particularly AV nodal reentry tachycardia ablation, is associated with a 
1% risk of AV block. Medications, including beta blockers, verapamil, 
diltiazem, and digoxin, are also common iatrogenic causes of AV block. 
Many patients with drug-induced AV block have preexisting conduc-
tion system disease. Iatrogenic AV block may occur rarely in the setting 
of thoracic radiation or chemotherapy. AV block is a rare complication 
of the surgical repair of ventricular septal defects (VSDs) or atrial septal 
defects (ASDs) but may complicate repairs of transposition of the great 
arteries.

 ■ AV BLOCK IN THE SETTING OF MYOCARDIAL 
ISCHEMIA
Coronary artery disease may produce transient or persistent AV block. 
In  the  setting  of  coronary  spasm,  ischemia,  particularly  in  the  right 
coronary artery distribution, may produce transient AV block. In acute 
myocardial infarction (MI), AV block transiently develops in 10–25% 
of patients; most commonly, this is first- or second-degree AV block, 
but  complete  heart  block  (CHB)  may  also  occur.  Second-degree  and 
higher-grade AV block tends to occur more often in inferior than in 
anterior acute MI; however, the level of block in inferior MI tends to 
be in the AV node with more stable, narrow escape rhythms. In con-
trast, acute anterior MI is associated with block in the distal AV nodal 
complex, His bundle, or bundle branches and results in wide complex,

unstable  escape  rhythms  and  a  worse  prognosis  with  high  mortality 
rates.

AV conduction abnormalities may be caused by either direct ische-
mia to the conduction system or enhanced autonomic tone (Bezold-
Jarisch reflex). Conduction abnormalities can be considered based on 
infarct location, and this may also predict which conduction abnormal-
ities may be reversible. High-grade AV block associated with inferior 
MI  is  often  located  proximal  to  the  His  bundle  in  90%  of  patients. 
Narrow  junctional  escape  typically  occurs  with  rates  >40  beats/min, 
and a temporary pacemaker is typically not required as the AV block 
is  often  reversible  and  successfully  managed  with  pharmacologic 
therapy. High-grade AV block in the setting of anterior MI is typically 
indicative of extensive infarction, is more often distal to the AV node, 
and is associated with a high mortality rate. Temporary pacing in this 
circumstance is typically indicated. CHB in the setting of anterior MI 
may also be preceded by RBB block due to the arterial supply of the 
proximal RBB.
 ■ INFECTIOUS CAUSES OF AV BLOCK
Infection  can  also  cause  AV  block.  AV  block  is  a  common  manifes-
tation of Lyme carditis due to infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. AV 
block is typically at the level of the AV node with narrow junctional 
escape rhythm >40 beats/min. Less commonly, conduction abnormali-
ties can occur below the level of the AV node or in the sinus node. AV 
block typically improves within 1 week of antibiotic therapy, although 
a longer time frame can occur in some patients. AV block in the setting 
of infective endocarditis should raise concern for perivalvular abscess, 
which may necessitate surgical intervention. Viral myocarditis, Chagas’ 
disease,  and  toxoplasmosis  are  less  common  infectious  causes  of  AV 
block. Infiltrative heart disease such as cardiac sarcoid, amyloid, and 
hemochromatosis  can  present  as  AV  block.  Autoimmune  diseases, 
including  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE),  rheumatoid  arthritis, 
mixed connective tissue disease, and scleroderma, may cause AV block 
due  to  infiltration  of  the  conduction  system.  Rare  malignancies  also 
may impair AV conduction.
 ■ AUTONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL CAUSES OF AV 
BLOCK
Functional causes of AV block (autonomic, metabolic/endocrine, and 
drug-related)  tend  to  be  reversible.  Most  other  etiologies  produce 
structural changes, typically fibrosis, in segments of the AV conduction

axis that are generally permanent. Heightened vagal tone during sleep 
or in well-conditioned individuals can be associated with all grades of 
AV block (Fig. 245-2).

Carotid  sinus  hypersensitivity,  vasovagal  syncope,  and  cough  and 
micturition  syncope  may  be  associated  with  SA  node  slowing  and 
AV  conduction  block.  Transient  metabolic  and  endocrinologic  dis-
turbances  and  a  number  of  pharmacologic  agents  also  may  produce 
reversible AV conduction block.
 ■ ACQUIRED AV BLOCK FROM FIBROSIS AND 
INFILTRATIVE CARDIOMYOPATHIES
Idiopathic progressive fibrosis of the conduction system is one of the 
more common and degenerative causes of AV conduction block. Aging 
is associated with degenerative changes in the summit of the ventricu-
lar septum, central fibrous body, and aortic and mitral annuli and has 
been described as “sclerosis of the left cardiac skeleton.” The process 
typically begins in the fourth decade of life and may be accelerated by 
atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Accelerated forms 
of progressive familial heart block have been identified in families with 
mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A) and other loci 
that have been mapped to chromosomes 1 and 19.

AV  conduction  block  has  been  associated  with  heritable  neuro-
muscular  diseases,  including  the  nucleotide  repeat  disease  myotonic 
dystrophy, the mitochondrial myopathy Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and 
several of the monogenic muscular dystrophies.
 ■ CONGENITAL AV BLOCK
Congenital AV block may be observed in complex congenital cardiac 
anomalies, such as transposition of the great arteries, ostium primum 
ASDs,  VSDs,  endocardial  cushion  defects,  and  some  single-ventricle 
defects.  Congenital  AV  block  in  the  setting  of  a  structurally  normal 
heart has been seen in children born to mothers with SLE and other 
autoimmune diseases.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Patients  with  conduction  abnormalities  should  be  evaluated  for  the 
presence  or  absence  of  structural  heart  disease.  Physical  exam  may 
reveal  valvular  heart  disease.  ECG  may  suggest  concomitant  disease 
that  predisposes  to  conduction  abnormalities.  Echocardiography  is 
also indicated to evaluate for structural heart disease including valvular 
abnormalities, ejection fraction, and ventricular wall motion. Because 
age-dependent  progressive  fibrosis  of  the  conduction  system  is  the 
most  common  cause,  AV  node  block  that  develops  at  a  younger  age 
(≤60  years)  may  warrant  advanced  imaging  such  as  chest  computed 
tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or CT/
positron emission tomography (PET) scan to further evaluate for infil-
trative heart disease such as sarcoidosis. Advanced imaging may also be 
warranted based on other factors in the history and testing that suggest 
the need for evaluation of infiltrative heart disease. Evaluation for car-
diac ischemia should be driven by the clinical suspicion at presentation 
(e.g., symptoms of ischemia, ECG abnormalities, etc.) (Fig. 245-3).

Diagnostic testing in the evaluation of AV block is aimed at deter-
mining  the  level  of  conduction  block,  particularly  in  asymptomatic 
patients, since the prognosis and therapy depend on whether the block 
is in or below the AV node. Vagal maneuvers, carotid sinus massage, 

exercise, and administration of drugs such as atropine and isoprotere-
nol may be diagnostically informative. Owing to the differences in the 
innervation of the AV node and infranodal conduction system, vagal 
stimulation and carotid sinus massage slow conduction in the AV node 
but have less of an effect on infranodal tissue and may even appear to 
improve conduction due to a reduced rate of activation of distal tissues. 
Conversely, atropine, isoproterenol, and exercise improve conduction 
through the AV node and may appear to impair infranodal conduction. 
In patients with congenital CHB and a narrow QRS complex, exercise 
typically  increases  heart  rate;  by  contrast,  those  with  acquired  CHB, 
particularly with wide QRS, do not respond to exercise with an increase 
in heart rate.

Additional diagnostic evaluation, including electrophysiologic test-
ing,  may  be  indicated  in  patients  with  syncope  and  suspected  high-
grade  AV  block.  This  is  particularly  relevant  if  noninvasive  testing 
does  not  reveal  the  cause  of  syncope  or  if  the  patient  has  structural 
heart  disease  with  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  as  a  cause  of  symp-
toms.  Electrophysiologic  testing  provides  more  precise  information 
regarding the location of AV conduction block and permits studies of 
AV conduction under conditions of pharmacologic stress and exercise. 
Recording of the His bundle electrogram by a catheter positioned at the 
superior  margin  of  the  tricuspid  valve  annulus  provides  information 
about conduction at all levels of the AV conduction axis. A properly 
recorded  His  bundle  electrogram  reveals  local  atrial  activity,  the  His 
electrogram,  and  local  ventricular  activation;  when  it  is  monitored 
simultaneously with recorded body surface ECG traces, intra-atrial, AV 
nodal, and infranodal conduction times can be assessed. The time from 
the most rapid deflection of the atrial electrogram in the His bundle 
recording to the His electrogram (AH interval) represents conduction 
through the AV node and is normally <130 ms. The time from the His 
electrogram to the earliest onset of the QRS on the surface ECG (HV 
interval)  represents  the  conduction  time  through  the  His-Purkinje 
system and is normally ≤55 ms (Fig. 245-4).

Rate stress produced by pacing can unveil abnormal AV conduction. 
Mobitz I second-degree AV block at short atrial paced cycle lengths is a 
normal response. However, when it occurs at atrial cycle lengths >500 ms 
(<120 beats/min) in the absence of high vagal tone, it is abnormal. Typ-
ically, type I second-degree AV block is associated with prolongation 
of the AH interval, representing conduction slowing and block in the 
AV node. AH prolongation occasionally is due to the effect of drugs 
(beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digitalis) or increased vagal 
tone. Atropine can be used to reverse high vagal tone; however, if AH 
prolongation and AV block at long pacing cycle lengths persist, intrin-
sic AV node disease is likely. Type II second-degree block is typically 
infranodal,  often  in  the  His-Purkinje  system.  Block  below  the  node 
with prolongation of the HV interval or a His bundle electrogram with 
no ventricular activation is abnormal unless it is elicited at fast pacing 
rates or short coupling intervals with extra stimulation. It is often dif-
ficult to determine the type of second-degree AV block when 2:1 con-
duction is present; however, the finding of a His bundle electrogram 
after every atrial electrogram indicates that block is occurring in the 
distal conduction system.

Intracardiac  recording  at  an  electrophysiologic  study  that  reveals  
prolongation of conduction through the His-Purkinje system (i.e., long

HV  interval)  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  progression  to 
higher grades of block and is generally an indication for pacing. In the 
setting of bundle branch block, the HV interval may reveal the condi-
tion of the unblocked bundle and the prognosis for developing more 
advanced  AV  conduction  block.  Prolongation  of  the  HV  interval  in 
patients with asymptomatic bundle branch block is associated with an 
increased risk of developing higher-grade AV block. The risk increases 
with greater prolongation of the HV interval such that in patients with 
an HV interval >100 ms, the annual incidence of complete AV block 
approaches 10%, indicating a need for pacing. In patients with acquired 
CHB, even if intermittent, there is little role for electrophysiologic test-
ing, and pacemaker implantation is almost always indicated.

TREATMENT
Acute Management of AV Conduction Block

The  first-line  strategies  for  management  of  AV  block  should  be 
to  eliminate  reversible  causes  and  to  determine  the  immediate 
safety and reliability of the heart rhythm (e.g., escape rhythm) and 
whether or not temporary or permanent pacing is warranted. The 
need for temporary pacing is determined by the symptoms of the 
patient, hemodynamic status, and the estimate of the level at which 
AV block is present. In a general sense, the lower in the conduction 
system that an escape rhythm is occurring, the lower is the reliabil-
ity  of  the  escape  rhythm.  A  narrow-complex  junctional  escape  of   
45 beats/min with no symptoms does not warrant urgent temporary 
pacing, whereas a wide-complex (implying block lower in the con-
duction system) escape rhythm at 30 beats/min does. Elimination 
of  unnecessary  medications  known  to  slow  AV  conduction  (e.g., 
beta blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, digoxin), correction of electro-
lyte abnormalities, ischemia, and inhibition of excessive vagal tone 
may  increase  the  heart  rate.  Adjunctive  pharmacologic  treatment 

with atropine or isoproterenol may be useful if the block is in the 
AV node. When pacing is indicated, the most expeditious technique 
is the use of transcutaneous pacing, where pacing patches are placed 
anteriorly over the cardiac apex (cathode) and posteriorly between 
the spine and the scapula or above the right nipple (anode). Acutely, 
transcutaneous pacing is highly effective, but its duration is limited 
by patient discomfort and longer-term failure to capture the ven-
tricle owing to changes in lead impedance. Transvenous temporary 
pacing is more reliable, and a pacing wire can be placed from the 
jugular, subclavian, or femoral venous system and advanced to the 
right ventricle, permitting stable temporary pacing.

AV  conduction  abnormalities  may  be  reversible  in  certain  cir-
cumstances including removal of unnecessary medication or toxins, 
correction of electrolyte abnormalities, relief of ischemia, treatment 
of  certain  infiltrative  heart  disease  (e.g.,  immunosuppression  in 
cardiac sarcoidosis), and treatment of sleep apnea in patients with 
nocturnal vagally mediated AV block. When symptomatic or infra-
nodal AV block is not reversible, which is often the case, permanent 
pacing is warranted. 
PERMANENT PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION
The  indications  for  pacing  in  AV  conduction  block  are  shown  in 
Fig.  245-5.  In  patients  with  acquired  Mobitz  type  II  AV  block, 
high-grade AV block, or third-degree AV block that is not reversible 
or  physiologic,  permanent  pacing  is  recommended  regardless  of 
symptoms. For all other types of AV block, in the absence of con-
ditions  associated  with  progressive  AV  conduction  abnormalities, 
permanent pacing should generally be considered only in the pres-
ence of symptoms that correlate with block. In patients with neuro-
muscular disease and other progressive cardiomyopathies affecting 
the conduction system, permanent pacemaker implantation is rec-
ommended  for  marked  first-degree  AV  block  and  Mobitz  I  AV 
block. Pacemaker implantation should be performed in any patient

FIGURE 245-5  Indications for pacing in patients with atrioventricular (AV) block. In patients presenting with AV block, the category of AV block should be determined 
(first-degree, second-degree, or complete heart block). In first-degree AV block, permanent pacing may be indicated in the setting of symptoms or higher-risk systemic 
disease  such  as  neuromuscular  disease  or  Lamin  A/C  cardiomyopathy.  In  Mobitz  I  AV  block,  pacing  may  be  considered  in  the  setting  of  symptoms  or  the  additional 
disease mentioned with first-degree AV block. In complete heart block or Mobitz II AV block, permanent pacing is generally indicated. Class I recommendations should be 
performed or are indicated. Class IIa recommendations are considered reasonable to perform. Class IIb recommendations may be considered. Class III recommendations 
are associated with harm more than benefit. (Reproduced with permission from FM Kusumoto et al: 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of 
patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay. Heart Rhythm 16:e128, 2019.)

with  symptomatic  bradycardia  and  irreversible  second-  or  third- 
degree  AV  block,  regardless  of  the  cause  or  level  of  block  in  the 
conducting system. Symptoms may include those directly related to 
bradycardia and low cardiac output or to worsening heart failure, 
angina, or intolerance to an essential medication. Pacing in patients 
with asymptomatic AV block should be individualized; situations in 
which pacing should be considered are patients with acquired CHB, 
particularly  in  the  setting  of  cardiac  enlargement;  left  ventricular 
dysfunction;  and  waking  heart  rates  ≤40  beats/min.  Patients  who 
have asymptomatic second-degree AV block of either type should 
be considered for pacing if the block is demonstrated to be intra- or 
infra-His  or  is  associated  with  a  wide  QRS  complex.  Pacing  may 
be indicated in asymptomatic patients in special circumstances, in 
patients  with  profound  first-degree  AV  block  and  left  ventricular 
dysfunction in whom a shorter AV interval produces hemodynamic 
improvement, and in the setting of milder forms of AV conduction 
delay  (first-degree  AV  block,  intraventricular  conduction  delay) 
in  patients  with  neuromuscular  diseases  that  have  a  predilection 
for the conduction system, such as myotonic dystrophy and other 
muscular dystrophies and Kearns-Sayre syndrome.

AV block in acute MI is often transient, particularly in inferior 
infarction. The circumstances in which pacing is indicated in acute 
MI  are  persistent  second-  or  third-degree  AV  block,  particularly 
if  symptomatic,  and  transient  second-  or  third-degree  AV  block 
associated with bundle branch block. Pacing is generally not indi-
cated in the setting of transient AV block in the absence of intra-
ventricular conduction delays or in the presence of fascicular block 
or first-degree AV block that develops in the setting of preexisting 
bundle branch block. Fascicular blocks that develop in acute MI in 
the absence of other forms of AV block also do not require pacing.
Distal  forms  of  AV  conduction  block  may  require  pacemaker 
implantation  in  certain  clinical  settings.  Patients  with  bifascicular 
or  trifascicular  block  and  symptoms,  particularly  syncope  that 
is  not  attributable  to  other  causes,  should  undergo  pacemaker 

implantation.  Permanent  pacemaker  implantation  is  indicated  in 
asymptomatic patients with bifascicular or trifascicular block who 
experience  intermittent  third-degree  block,  type  II  second-degree 
AV  block,  or  alternating  bundle  branch  block.  In  patients  with 
fascicular  block  who  are  undergoing  electrophysiologic  study,  a 
markedly  prolonged  HV  interval  or  block  below  the  His  at  long 
cycle lengths also may constitute an indication for permanent pac-
ing. Patients with fascicular block and the neuromuscular diseases 
previously described should also undergo pacemaker implantation. 
SELECTION OF PACING MODE AND SYSTEM
In  general,  a  pacing  mode  that  maintains  AV  synchrony  reduces 
complications  of  pacing  such  as  pacemaker  syndrome  and   
pacemaker-mediated  tachycardia.  This  is  particularly  true  in 
younger  patients;  the  importance  of  dual-chamber  pacing  in  the 
elderly, however, is less well established, although AV synchrony in 
patients with sinus rhythm and AV block is typically desired. 
Physiologic  Ventricular  Pacing 
In  patients  with  left  ventricular 
ejection  fraction  <50%  and  AV  block  who  have  an  indication  for 
permanent  pacing  and  are  expected  to  require  ventricular  pacing 
>40% of the time, techniques to provide more physiologic ventric-
ular activation are preferred to right ventricular pacing to prevent 
heart  failure.  Cardiac  resynchronization  therapy  (CRT)  involves 
placement of an additional pacing lead in a lateral or anterolateral 
branch of the coronary sinus to allow for simultaneous right ven-
tricle and lateral left ventricle pacing leading to a more physiologic 
left ventricular contraction. CRT pacing has been shown to improve 
outcomes  and  mortality  in  appropriately  selected  patients.  Phys-
iologic  ventricular  pacing  has  also  been  achieved  with  placement 
of  a  ventricular  pacing  lead  in  the  region  of  the  His  bundle.  His 
bundle pacing recruits the specialized conduction system, leading 
to a more physiologic cardiac contraction. In addition to His bun-
dle  pacing,  left  bundle  branch  area  pacing  in  the  proximal  inter-
ventricular  septal  region  has  also  been  shown  to  achieve  a  more

physiologic pacing response. The selection of pacing lead location 
should be individualized (Fig. 245-6).

The availability of leadless miniaturized pacing systems may be 
appropriate in selected patients. Leadless pacemakers are completely 
self-contained devices that are implanted via the femoral vein into 
the  right  ventricle.  The  technology  for  these  devices  continues  to 
evolve, and the most recent models are capable of detecting atrial 
mechanical  contraction  to  allow  for  the  preservation  of  AV  syn-
chrony. The device can provide single-chamber ventricular pacing 
in addition to containing technology that can sense atrial activity 
(utilizing  the  accelerometer  in  the  pacemaker)  to  coordinate  an 
atrial  sensed,  ventricular  paced  rhythm  (AV  synchrony).  Leadless 
pacemakers  can  be  particularly  useful  in  patients  with  vascular 
access limitations. Because there is no intravascular pacing wire or 
implanted subcutaneous pacemaker generator, the long-term infec-
tion rate is lower and there is no risk of lead fracture (Fig. 245-7).
Several studies have failed to demonstrate a difference in mortal-
ity rate in older patients with AV block treated with a single- (VVI) 
compared with a dual- (DDD) chamber pacing mode. In some of 
the studies that randomized pacing mode, the risk of chronic atrial 
fibrillation  and  stroke  risk  decreased  with  physiologic  pacing.  In 

patients with sinus rhythm and AV block, the very modest increase 
in  risk  with  dual-chamber  pacemaker  implantation  appears  to  be 
justified  to  avoid  the  possible  complications  of  single-chamber 
pacing.

246 Approach to  

Supraventricular 
Tachyarrhythmias
William H. Sauer, Paul C. Zei

The  most  common  arrhythmias  that  patients  present  with  are  part  of 
a  broad  category  defined  by  anatomic  origin  termed  supraventricular 
tachycardias (SVTs). SVTs originate from or are dependent on conduc-
tion through the atrium or atrioventricular (AV) node to the ventricles. 
Most produce narrow QRS complex tachycardia (QRS duration <120 ms)  
characteristic  of  ventricular  activation  over  the  Purkinje  system  and 
thus are sometimes referred to as a narrow-complex tachycardias. The 
QRS morphology of the SVT is usually identical to the sinus rhythm 
QRS. Conduction block in the left or right bundle branch or activation 
of the ventricles from an accessory pathway produces a wide QRS com-
plex  during  SVT  that  must  be  distinguished  from  ventricular  tachy-
cardia (VT). Mechanisms of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia can be 
divided into physiologic sinus tachycardia and pathologic tachycardia 
(Table 246-1).

Pathologic  tachycardia  can  be  further  subclassified  by  mechanism 
as  reentrant  arrhythmias  dependent  on  AV  nodal  conduction  (e.g., 
AVNRT),  large  reentry  circuits  within  the  atrial  tissue  alone  (e.g., 
atrial flutter), or focal atrial tachycardias that can be due to automa-
ticity  or  small  reentry  circuits.  The  prognosis  and  treatment  vary 
considerably  depending  on  the  mechanism  and  underlying  heart 
disease.  SVT  can  be  of  brief  duration,  termed  nonsustained,  or  can 
be  sustained  such  that  an  intervention,  such  as  cardioversion,  cathe-
ter  ablation,  or  drug  administration,  is  required  for  termination  and 
maintenance of sinus rhythm. Episodes that occur with sudden onset 
and termination are referred to as paroxysmal. Paroxysmal supraven-
tricular tachycardia (PSVT) refers to a family of tachycardias including 
AV  node  reentry,  AV  reciprocating  tachycardia  using  an  accessory 
pathway,  and  atrial  tachycardia  described  in  subsequent  chapters  
(Fig. 246-1).

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Symptoms of supraventricular arrhythmia vary depending on the rate, 
duration, associated heart disease, and comorbidities and include palpi-
tations, chest pain, dyspnea, diminished exertional capacity, and occa-
sionally  syncope.  Rarely,  a  supraventricular  arrhythmia  precipitates 
cardiac  arrest  in  patients  with  Wolff-Parkinson-White  (WPW)  syn-
drome or severe heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

 ■ INITIAL EVALUATION
The  diagnosis  of  SVT  is  most  often  entertained  when  evaluating  a 
patient  for  arrhythmia-related  symptoms  or  when  evidence  of  ven-
tricular  preexcitation  is  seen  on  an  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  as  an 
outpatient. Diagnosis of SVT requires obtaining an ECG at the time of 
symptoms (Fig. 246-2). Ventricular preexcitation on the resting ECG 
suggests  AV  reciprocating  tachycardia  using  an  accessory  pathway. 
When  the  arrhythmia  is  ongoing  at  the  time  of  recording,  the  ECG 
usually  establishes  or  suggests  the  diagnosis.  In  the  urgent  care  or 
inpatient setting, treatment of SVT will often involve vagal maneuvers 
or  carotid  sinus  massage  (CSM)  to  achieve  AV  block  (Table  246-2). 
In  the  appropriate  patient,  CSM  should  be  used  cautiously,  if  at  all, 
if  there  is  concern  for  carotid  atherosclerosis  that  may  be  embolized 
during manipulation. If this is unsuccessful, the administration of 6 or 
12 mg of adenosine to cause transient AV block is usually successful 
in terminating an AV nodal–dependent SVT or diagnosing a non-AV 
nodal–dependent SVT such as atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter. There 
are  some  atrial  tachycardias  that  are  adenosine  sensitive,  and  thus, 

TABLE 246-1  Mechanisms of Supraventricular Tachyarrhythmia
Physiologic Sinus Tachycardia

Defining feature: normal sinus mechanism precipitated by exertion, stress, 
exogenous or endogenous stimulants, concurrent illness

Pathologic Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)

A.  Tachycardias originating from the atrium
Defining feature: tachycardia may continue despite beats that fail to conduct to 
the ventricles, indicating that the atrioventricular (AV) node is not participating in 
the tachycardia circuit

1.  Inappropriate sinus tachycardia

Defining feature: tachycardia from the normal sinus node area that occurs 
without an identifiable precipitating factor as a result of dysfunctional autonomic 
regulation

2.  Focal atrial tachycardia (AT)

Defining feature: regular atrial tachycardia with defined P wave; may be 
sustained, nonsustained, paroxysmal, or incessant; frequent sites of origin occur 
along the valve annuli of left or right atrium, pulmonary veins, coronary sinus 
musculature, superior vena cava

3.  Atrial flutter and macroreentrant atrial tachycardia

Defining feature: macroreentry reflected as organized atrial activity on an 
electrocardiogram (ECG), commonly seen as sawtooth flutter waves at rates 
typically faster than 200 beats/min

4.  Atrial fibrillation

Defining feature: chaotic rapid atrial electrical activity with variable ventricular 
rate; the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in older adults

5.  Multifocal atrial tachycardia

Defining feature: multiple discrete P waves often seen in patients with pulmonary 
disease during acute exacerbations of pulmonary insufficiency
B.  AV nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT)
Defining feature: paroxysmal regular tachycardia with P waves visible at the end 
of the QRS complex or not visible at all; the most common paroxysmal sustained 
tachycardia in healthy young adults; more common in women
C.  Tachycardias associated with accessory atrioventricular pathways

1.  Orthodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT)

Defining feature: paroxysmal sustained tachycardia similar to AV nodal reentry; 
during sinus rhythm, evidence of ventricular preexcitation may be present 
(Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) or absent (concealed accessory  
pathway)

2.  Preexcited tachycardia

Defining feature: wide QRS tachycardia with QRS morphology similar to 
ventricular tachycardia

a.   Antidromic AV reciprocating tachycardia—regular paroxysmal 

tachycardia

b.   Atrial fibrillation with preexcitation—irregular wide-complex or 

intermittently wide-complex tachycardia, some with dangerously rapid 
rates faster than 250/min

c.  Atrial tachycardia or flutter with preexcitation

termination of an SVT with adenosine does not exclude this potential 
diagnosis.

For transient arrhythmias, ambulatory ECG recording is warranted. 
Patients  will  often  have  access  to  ECG  recording  devices,  such  as  a 
watch  or  smartphone-enabled  electrogram  recording  electrode  pair. 
Therefore, a patient may have the ECG diagnosis before seeing a phy-
sician (Fig. 246-3).

Exercise  testing  is  useful  for  assessing  exercise-related  symp-
toms  and  potentially  evoking  the  arrhythmia.  Additional  evalu-
ation  for  underlying  cardiac  disease  and  to  exclude  potentially 
dangerous  arrhythmias  should  be  performed  based  on  the  clini-
cal  scenario.  Occasionally,  an  invasive  electrophysiology  study  is 
warranted  to  provoke  the  arrhythmia  with  pacing,  confirm  the 
mechanism,  and  risk  stratify  the  patient,  but  most  commonly,  this 
is  performed  at  the  time  of  intended  catheter  ablation  to  treat  the  
arrhythmia.

(SVT). AT, focal atrial tachycardia; AVNRT, atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry tachycardia; ORT, orthodromic AV reentry tachycardia.

Paroxysmal SVT is most commonly encountered in patients who do 
not have structural heart disease. Other supraventricular arrhythmias, 
particularly  atrial  fibrillation,  are  often  associated  with  a  variety  of 
heart  diseases.  At  initial  evaluation,  history  and  examination  should 
assess possible underlying heart disease. Any abnormal findings may 
warrant further cardiac evaluation.

The  most  common  SVT  is  sinus  tachycardia  in  response  to  phys-
iologic  stress,  such  as  exercise,  but  it  can  also  be  a  manifestation 
of  acute  illness.  The  first  step  in  diagnosis  of  SVT  is  to  consider 
the  possibility  of  sinus  tachycardia.  Therapy  is  then  determined  by 

the  clinical  findings  and  probable  diagnosis.  If  sinus  tachycardia  is 
diagnosed,  treatment  of  the  underlying  inciting  cause  is  the  primary 
approach. If the arrhythmia is ongoing and is not due to sinus tachy-
cardia,  initial  assessment  determines  whether  immediate  therapy  is 
needed to terminate the arrhythmia or slow the rate. Arrhythmias that 
cause  hypotension,  impaired  consciousness,  angina,  or  heart  failure 
warrant immediate therapy, guided by the type of arrhythmia. Treat-
ment  options  for  specific  types  of  SVT  are  discussed  in  more  detail 
in  subsequent  chapters  and  include  pharmacologic  and  procedural  
interventions.

Nonphysiologic Sinus 
Tachycardia
William H. Sauer, Paul C. Zei

The sinus node is composed of a group of cells located in the lateral 
superior aspect of the junction between the right atrium and superior 
vena  cava,  within  the  superior  aspect  of  the  thick  ridge  of  muscle 
known as the crista terminalis where the posterior smooth atrial wall 
derived from the sinus venosus meets the trabeculated anterior portion 
of the right atrium. Patients with sinus tachycardia will often seek med-
ical attention with the uncomfortable awareness of their heartbeat as 
their chief complaint. Often, an arrhythmia is suspected because of the 
similar  constellation  of  symptoms  that  accompanies  supraventricular 
and ventricular tachycardia or atrial and ventricular ectopy. However, 
a  careful  review  of  the  12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  reveals  a 
characteristic P wave originating from the superior and lateral aspect 
of the right atrium with a positive deflection in leads I, II, and III and

by  a  frontal  plane  axis  directed  inferiorly  and  leftward,  with  positive  
P waves in leads II, III, and aVF; a negative P wave in aVR; and an ini-
tially positive biphasic P wave in V1. Normal sinus rhythm has a range 
of rates between 60 and 100 beats/min (Fig. 247-1).

PHYSIOLOGIC SINUS TACHYCARDIA
Sinus  tachycardia  (>100  beats/min)  typically  occurs  in  response  to 
sympathetic  stimulation  and  vagal  withdrawal,  whereby  the  rate  of 
spontaneous depolarization of the sinus node increases and the focus 
of earliest activation within the node typically shifts more leftward and 
closer to the superior septal aspect of the crista terminalis, thus pro-
ducing taller P waves in the inferior limb leads when compared to nor-
mal sinus rhythm. Sinus bradycardia is defined as rates <60 beats/min; 
however, bradycardia can be normal during sleep and in fit individuals.
Sinus tachycardia is considered physiologic when it is an appropriate 
response to exercise, stress, or illness. Sinus tachycardia can be difficult 
to distinguish from focal atrial tachycardia (see below) that originates 
near the sinus node. A causative factor (e.g., exertion) and a gradual 
rate  increase  favor  a  diagnosis  of  sinus  tachycardia,  whereas  abrupt 
tachycardia onset and offset favor atrial tachycardia (Fig. 247-2).

The distinction can be difficult and occasionally requires extended 
ECG  monitoring  or  invasive  electrophysiology  study.  Treatment  for 
physiologic  sinus  tachycardia  is  aimed  at  the  underlying  condition, 
but  frequently,  no  therapy  is  necessary.  Consideration  to  abnormal 
thyroid conditions and anemia should be given in patients with sinus 
tachycardia as these represent reversible causes. In addition, structural 
and  functional  cardiovascular  abnormalities  can  present  as  sinus 
tachycardia, especially pulmonary embolism, and thus must be ruled 
out before considering sinus tachycardia as nonphysiologic. Finally, as 
sinus rate varies widely between individuals, a relatively elevated sinus 
rate  (whether  at  rest  or  during  exercise)  without  underlying  cause, 
particularly  without  symptoms,  typical  does  not  warrant  treatment 
(Table 247-1).

NONPHYSIOLOGIC SINUS TACHYCARDIA
Inappropriate  sinus  tachycardia  is  an  uncommon  condition  in  which 
the sinus rate increases spontaneously at rest or out of proportion to 
physiologic stress or exertion and is within a spectrum of ill-defined 
conditions  associated  with  autonomic  dysregulation.  The  underlying 
mechanism remains elusive, but it may be related to imbalance between

Affected individuals are often women in the third or fourth decade of 
life. Fatigue, dizziness, and even syncope may accompany palpitations, 
which can be disabling. Additional symptoms of chest pain, headaches, 
and gastrointestinal upset are common. Inappropriate sinus tachycar-
dia must be distinguished from appropriate sinus tachycardia and from 
focal atrial tachycardia arising from a region near the sinus node. The 
distinction  between  physiologic  sinus  tachycardia  due  to  an  anxiety 
disorder and inappropriate sinus tachycardia can be difficult. Therapy 
is often ineffective or poorly tolerated. Careful titration of beta blockers 
and/or  calcium  channel  blockers  may  reduce  symptoms.  Clonidine 
and  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  have  also  been  used.  Ivabradine, 
a  drug  that  blocks  the  If  current  that  causes  spontaneous  sinus  node 
depolarization, is approved in the United States for use in heart failure, 
but  it  has  also  been  effective  in  the  treatment  of  inappropriate  sinus 
tachycardia. Catheter ablation of the sinus node to modify and thereby 
decrease the sinus rate has been performed, but long-term control of 
symptoms  is  usually  poor  and  can  result  in  a  permanent  pacemaker 
requirement due to resultant symptomatic bradycardia or chronotropic 
incompetence (Fig. 247-3).

from  a  supine  position  to  standing.  The  sinus  rate  increases  by  
30 beats/min or to >120 beats/min within 10 min of standing and in 
the  absence  of  hypotension.  Symptoms  are  often  similar  to  those  in 
patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. POTS is sometimes due 
to  autonomic  dysfunction  following  a  viral  illness  and  may  resolve 
spontaneously  over  3–12  months.  Volume  expansion  with  salt  sup-
plementation,  oral  fludrocortisone,  compression  stockings,  and  the 
α-agonist  midodrine,  often  in  combination,  can  be  helpful.  Exercise 
training has also been shown to improve symptoms and should be a 
part of a treatment strategy to reduce symptoms. While it is sometimes 
difficult  to  differentiate  inappropriate  sinus  tachycardia  from  POTS, 
recognition of these distinct clinical syndromes is critical for treatment. 
Sinus node modification will be ineffective for the treatment of POTS. 
Likewise, treatment strategies aimed at increasing blood pressure will 
not be appropriate for inappropriate sinus tachycardia.

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular System248 Focal Atrial Tachycardia

William H. Sauer, Paul C. Zei

The  underlying  mechanisms  of  focal  atrial  tachycardia  (AT)  include 
abnormal  automaticity,  triggered  automaticity,  or  a  small  reentry 
circuit in diseased atrial tissue. The term focal is used to differentiate 
this  form  of  atrial  tachycardia  from  typical  and  atypical  atrial  flutter 
but does not define a mechanism of the arrhythmia. ATs can originate 
from most regions of the atria, including atrial tissue extending into a 
pulmonary vein, the coronary sinus, or vena cava. It can be sustained, 
nonsustained, paroxysmal, or incessant. Focal AT accounts for ~10% of 
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVTs) in patients referred 
for catheter ablation. Nonsustained focal AT is commonly observed on 
ambulatory  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  recordings,  and  the  prevalence 
increases with age. Treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic 
nonsustained atrial tachycardia identified on ECG monitoring. How-
ever, frequent atrial ectopy and nonsustained AT are often precursors 
to  more  significant  arrhythmias  such  as  atrial  fibrillation  and  atrial 
flutter. Nonsustained, frequent atrial ectopy or short bursts of AT may 
be symptomatic and require therapy similar to that required for focal 
AT (Fig. 248-1).

AT can occur in the absence of structural heart disease or may be 
associated with any condition that causes atrial fibrosis, including prior 
catheter  ablation.  Areas  of  fibrosis  can  act  as  a  nidus  for  abnormal 
automaticity from damaged cells or microreentry within zones of slow 
conduction  within  and  on  the  border  of  fibrotic  areas.  Sympathetic 
stimulation is a promoting factor, and the emergence of AT can be a 
sign  of  underlying  illness.  AT  with  atrioventricular  (AV)  block  may 
occur in digitalis toxicity. Symptoms from AT are highly variable but 
similar  to  other  supraventricular  tachycardias  (SVTs),  and  incessant 
AT can cause tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

AT  typically  presents  with  1:1  AV  conduction  or  with  AV  block 
in  a  Wenckebach  or  fixed  (e.g.,  2:1  or  3:1)  pattern.  Because  it  is  not 
dependent  on  AV  nodal  conduction,  AT  will  not  terminate  with  AV 
block,  and  the  atrial  rate  will  not  be  affected,  which  distinguishes 
AT from most AV nodal–dependent SVTs, such as AV nodal reentry 
and AV reentry using an accessory pathway (see below). A so-called 
warm-up phase when the atrial activation rate increases after initiation

or  a  cool-down  phase  when  the  rate  slows  prior  to  termination  also 
favors AT rather than AV nodal–dependent SVT, as this is a common 
observation  with  triggered  automaticity.  P  waves  are  often  discrete, 
with an intervening isoelectric segment, in contrast to atrial flutter and 
macroreentrant AT because atrial activation from a focal source occurs 
through a small portion of the tachycardia cycle (Fig. 248-2).

When 1:1 conduction to the ventricles is present, the arrhythmia can 
resemble  sinus  tachycardia  typically  with  a  P-R  interval  shorter  than 
the R-P interval, particularly when sympathetic tone results in rapid AV 
nodal conduction. It can be distinguished from sinus tachycardia by the 
P-wave morphology, which usually differs from sinus P waves depend-
ing on the location of the focus. Focal AT tends to originate in areas 
of complex atrial anatomy, such as the crista terminalis, valve annuli, 
atrial septum, and atrial muscle extending along cardiac thoracic veins 
(superior  vena  cava,  coronary  sinus,  and  pulmonary  veins),  and  the 
location can often be estimated by the P-wave morphology. AT from 
the atrial septum will frequently have a narrower P-wave duration than 
sinus rhythm. AT from the left atrium will usually have a monophasic, 
positive P wave in lead V1 and negative P waves in I and aVL, indicat-
ing an activation wavefront away from the left atrial free wall. AT that 
originates from superior atrial locations, such as the superior vena cava 
or superior pulmonary veins, will be positive in the inferior limb leads 
II, III, and aVF, whereas AT from a more inferior location, such as the 
ostium of the coronary sinus, will inscribe negative P waves in these 
same leads. When the focus is in the superior aspect of the crista ter-
minalis, close to the sinus node, however, the P wave will resemble that 
of sinus tachycardia. Abrupt onset and offset then favor AT rather than 
sinus  tachycardia.  Depending  on  the  atrial  rate,  the  P  wave  may  fall 
on top of the T wave, or during 2:1 conduction, it may fall coincident 
with the QRS. Maneuvers that increase AV block, such as carotid sinus 
massage, Valsalva maneuver, or administration of AV nodal–blocking 
agents, such as adenosine, are useful to create AV block that will expose 
the P wave.

Acute  management  of  sudden-onset,  sustained  AT  is  the  same  as 
for other forms of PSVT, but the response to pharmacologic therapy is 
variable, likely depending on the mechanism (Fig. 248-3).

For  AT  due  to  reentry,  administration  of  adenosine  or  vagal 
maneuvers  may  transiently  increase  AV  block  without  terminating 
tachycardia. Some ATs terminate with a sufficient dose of adenosine, 
consistent  with  triggered  activity  as  the  mechanism.  Cardioversion 
can  be  effective  in  some  but  fails  in  others  because  of  immediate 
recurrence, suggesting automaticity as the mechanism in these cases.

Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers may slow the ventricular rate 
by increasing AV block, which can improve tolerance of the arrhythmias, 
but  large  doses  are  sometimes  required.  Potential  precipitating  factors 
and  intercurrent  illness  should  be  sought  and  corrected.  Underlying 
heart disease should be considered and excluded.

For patients with recurrent episodes, beta blockers, calcium channel 
blockers  such  as  diltiazem  or  verapamil,  and  antiarrhythmic  drugs 
such  as  flecainide,  propafenone,  disopyramide,  sotalol,  and  amiodar-
one can be effective, but potential toxicities and adverse effects often 
warrant avoidance of long-term use.

In this chapter, sustained supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) depen-
dent  on  the  atrioventricular  (AV)  node  are  discussed.  These  include 
AV  nodal  reentry  tachycardia  (AVNRT),  junctional  tachycardia,  AV 
reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) utilizing an accessory pathway, and 
a group of additional various SVTs that involve an accessory pathway, 
termed  preexcited  tachycardias.  The  term  SVT  encompasses  a  broad 
group of tachyarrhythmias based on anatomic origin and technically 
includes  sinus  tachycardia,  atrial  tachycardia  (AT),  atrial  flutter,  and 
atrial fibrillation; however, for the purposes of describing an organized 
approach to diagnosis and treatment of SVT, a separate discussion for 
these non-AV nodal–dependent SVTs are discussed elsewhere.

ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRY 
TACHYCARDIA
AVNRT  is  the  most  common  form  of  paroxysmal  supraventricular 
tachycardia (PSVT), representing ~60% of cases referred for catheter 
ablation. It most commonly manifests in the second to fourth decades 
of  life,  often  in  women.  It  is  often  well  tolerated,  but  rapid  tachycar-
dia, particularly in the elderly, may cause angina, pulmonary edema, 
hypotension,  or  syncope.  It  is  not  usually  associated  with  structural 
heart disease. In patients without associated heart disease, AVNRT is 
not  a  life-threatening  arrhythmia;  however,  it  may  cause  significant 
symptoms.

The mechanism is reentry involving the AV node and the perinodal 
atrium, made possible by the existence of multiple pathways for con-
duction from the atrium into the AV node that are capable of conduc-
tion in two directions (Fig. 249-1).

Most forms of AVNRT utilize a slowly conducting AV nodal path-
way (right inferior extension) that extends from the compact AV node 
near the His bundle, inferiorly along the tricuspid valve annulus to the 
floor of the coronary sinus. The reentry wavefront propagates up this 
slowly  conducting  pathway  to  the  compact  AV  node  and  then  exits 
from  the  fast  pathway  at  the  top  of  the  AV  node.  The  path  back  to 
the  slow  pathway  probably  involves  the  left  atrial  septum,  which  has 
connections  to  the  coronary  sinus  musculature.  More  unusual  forms 
of AVNRT utilize a left inferior extension that connects to the compact 
AV node through the roof of the coronary sinus or, in extremely rare 

cases,  directly  from  the  mitral  valve  annulus  avoiding  the  coronary 
sinus  musculature  altogether.  In  typical  forms,  the  conduction  time 
from the compact AV node region to the atrium is similar to that from 
the  compact  node  to  the  His  bundle  and  ventricles,  such  that  atrial 
activation occurs at about the same time as ventricular activation. The 
P wave is therefore inscribed during, slightly before, or slightly after the 
QRS and can be difficult to discern. Often the P wave is seen at the end 
of the QRS complex as a pseudo-r′ in lead V1 and pseudo-S waves in 
leads II, III, and aVF (Fig. 249-2).

More unusual forms of AVNRT have P waves falling later, anywhere 
between QRS complexes, in which case, an inverted P wave is seen in 
the inferior limb leads with the inverted P wave seen in the subsequent 
T  wave.  The  rate  can  vary  with  sympathetic  tone  through  its  effect 
on the conduction time of AV nodal tissues. Simultaneous atrial and 
ventricular contraction results in atrial contraction against a closed tri-
cuspid valve, producing a cannon A wave visible in the jugular venous 
pulse  often  perceived  as  a  fluttering  sensation  in  the  neck.  Elevated 
venous pressures may also lead to release of natriuretic peptides that 
cause posttachycardia diuresis. In contrast to ATs, maneuvers or med-
ications that produce AV nodal block terminate the arrhythmia. Acute 
treatment is the same as for other forms of PSVT (discussed below). 
Whether  ongoing  therapy  is  warranted  depends  on  the  severity  of 
symptoms and frequency of episodes. Reassurance and instruction as 
to how to perform the Valsalva maneuver or other vagal nerve stimu-
lating maneuvers to terminate episodes are sufficient for many patients.

1896 Administration of an oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem at the 
onset of an episode can be used to facilitate termination. Chronic ther-
apy  with  these  medications  or  flecainide  is  an  option  if  prophylactic 
therapy is needed. Catheter ablation of the slow AV nodal pathway is 
recommended for patients with recurrent or severe episodes or when 
drug therapy is ineffective, not tolerated, or not desired by the patient. 
Catheter ablation is curative in >95% of patients. The major risk is AV 
block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation, which occurs in 
<1% of patients.

JUNCTIONAL TACHYCARDIA
Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is due to automaticity within the 
AV  node.  It  is  rare  in  adults  and  more  frequently  encountered  as  an 
incessant  tachycardia  in  children,  often  in  the  perioperative  period 
of  surgery  for  congenital  heart  disease.  It  presents  as  a  narrow  QRS 
tachycardia,  often  with  ventriculoatrial  (VA)  block,  such  that  AV 
dissociation is present. JET can occur as a manifestation of increased 
adrenergic tone and may be seen after administration of isoproterenol, 
particularly after catheter ablation in the perinodal region. It may also 
occur for a short period of time after ablation for AVNRT. Accelerated 
junctional  rhythm  is  a  junctional  automatic  rhythm  between  50  and 
100 beats/min. Initiation may occur with gradual acceleration in rate, 
suggesting  an  automatic  focus,  or  after  a  premature  ventricular  con-
traction, suggesting a focus of triggered automaticity. VA conduction 
is  usually  present,  with  P-wave  morphology  and  timing  such  that  it 
resembles AVNRT at a slow rate. It can be related to increased sympa-
thetic tone and may produce palpitations. It usually does not require 
specific therapy.

ACCESSORY PATHWAYS AND THE  
WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE SYNDROME
Accessory  pathways  (APs)  occur  in  1  in  1500–2000  people  and  are 
associated  with  a  variety  of  arrhythmias  including  narrow-complex 
PSVT,  wide-complex  tachycardias,  and,  rarely,  sudden  death.  Most 
patients have structurally normal hearts, but APs are associated with 
Ebstein’s  anomaly  of  the  tricuspid  valve  and  forms  of  hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy  including  PRKAG2  mutations,  Danon’s  disease,  and 
Fabry’s disease (Fig. 249-3).

APs are abnormal connections that allow conduction between the 
atrium and ventricles across the AV ring. They are present from birth 
and are due to failure of complete partitioning of atrium and ventricle 
by the fibrous AV rings. They occur across either an AV valve annulus 
or the septum, most frequently between the left atrium and free wall 
of  the  left  ventricle,  followed  by  posteroseptal,  right  free  wall,  and 
anteroseptal  locations.  If  the  impulse  from  the  sinus  node  conducts 
through  the  AP  to  the  ventricle  (antegrade)  before  the  impulse  con-
ducts  through  the  AV  node  and  His  bundle,  then  the  ventricles  are 
preexcited  during  sinus  rhythm,  and  the  electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
shows a short P-R interval (<0.12 s), slurred initial portion of the QRS 
(delta wave), and prolonged QRS duration produced by slow conduc-
tion through direct activation of ventricular myocardium over the AP. 
The morphology of the QRS and delta wave is determined by the AP 
location  and  the  degree  of  fusion  between  the  excitation  wavefronts 
from  conduction  over  the  AV  node  and  conduction  over  the  AP  
(Fig. 249-4).

Right-sided pathways preexcite the right ventricle, producing a left 
bundle  branch  block–like  configuration  in  lead  V1,  and  often  create 
marked  preexcitation  because  of  relatively  close  proximity  of  the  AP 
to  the  sinus  node  (Fig.  249-4).  Left-sided  pathways  preexcite  the  left 
ventricle and may produce a right bundle branch–like configuration in 
lead V1 and a negative delta wave in aVL, indicating initial depolariza-
tion of the lateral portion of the left ventricle that can mimic Q waves 
of  lateral  wall  infarction  (Fig.  249-4).  Because  of  the  relatively  large 
distance between the sinus node and left free wall APs, preexcitation 
may be minimal or absent on 12-lead ECG. Preexcitation due to an AP 
at  the  diaphragmatic  surface  of  the  heart,  typically  in  the  paraseptal 
region,  produces  delta  waves  that  are  negative  in  leads  III  and  aVF,

tation can be intermittent and disappear during exercise as conduction 
over the AV node accelerates and may take over ventricular activation 
completely.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is defined as a preexcited 
QRS during sinus rhythm and episodes of PSVT. There are a number of 
variations of APs that may not cause preexcitation and/or arrhythmias. 
Concealed  APs  allow  only  retrograde  conduction,  from  ventricle  to 
atrium,  so  no  preexcitation  is  present  during  sinus  rhythm,  but  SVT 
can  occur.  Other  unusual  forms  of  APs  occur.  Fasciculoventricular

connections between the His bundle and ventricular septum produce 
preexcitation but do not cause arrhythmia, probably because the circuit 
is too short to promote reentry. Atriofascicular pathways, also known 
as  Mahaim  fibers,  probably  represent  a  duplicate  AV  node  and  His-
Purkinje system that connect the right atrium to fascicles of the right 
bundle branch and produce a wide-complex tachycardia having a left 
bundle branch block configuration.

ATRIOVENTRICULAR RECIPROCATING 
TACHYCARDIA
The  most  common  tachycardia  caused  by  an  AP  is  the  PSVT  desig-
nated orthodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia. The circulating reentry 
wavefront propagates from the atrium anterogradely over the AV node 
and His-Purkinje system to the ventricles and then reenters the atria 
via  retrograde  conduction  over  the  AP.  The  QRS  is  narrow  or  may 
have typical right or left bundle branch block, but without preexcita-
tion during tachycardia. Because excitation through the AV node and 
AP are necessary, AV or VA block results in tachycardia termination. 
During sinus rhythm, preexcitation is seen if the pathway also allows 
anterograde conduction. Most commonly, during tachycardia, the R-P 
interval  is  shorter  than  the  P-R  interval  and  can  resemble  AVNRT. 
Unlike typical AVNRT, P waves always follow the QRS and are never 
simultaneous with a narrow QRS complex because the ventricles must 
be activated before the reentry wavefront reaches the AP and conducts 
back to the atrium. The morphology of the P wave is determined by the 
pathway location, but it can be difficult to assess because it is usually 
inscribed during the ST segment. The P wave in posteroseptal APs is 
negative in leads II, III, and aVF, similar to that of AV nodal reentry, 
but  P-wave  morphology  differs  from  AV  nodal  reentry  for  pathways 
in  other  locations.  Occasionally,  an  AP  conducts  extremely  slowly 
in  the  retrograde  direction,  resulting  in  tachycardia  with  a  long  R-P

interval, similar to most ATs. These pathways are usually located in the 
septal region and have negative P waves in leads II, III, and aVF. Slow 
AP  conduction  facilitates  reentry,  often  leading  to  nearly  incessant 
tachycardia, known as permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia 
(PJRT).  Tachycardia-induced  cardiomyopathy  can  occur.  Without 
an invasive electrophysiology study, it may be difficult to distinguish 
this form of orthodromic AV reentry from atypical AV nodal reentry  
or AT.

PREEXCITED TACHYCARDIAS
Preexcited  tachycardia  occurs  when  the  ventricles  are  activated  by 
antegrade conduction over the AP. The most common mechanism is 
antidromic AV reciprocating tachycardia in which activation propagates 
from atrium to ventricle via the AP and then conducts retrogradely to 
the atria via the His-Purkinje system and the AV node (or rarely a sec-
ond AP). The wide QRS complex is produced entirely via ventricular 
excitation over the AP because there is no contribution of ventricular 
activation  over  more  rapidly  conducting  specialized  His-Purkinje 
fibers. This tachycardia is often indistinguishable from monomorphic 
ventricular tachycardia. The presence of preexcitation in sinus rhythm 
suggests the diagnosis.

Preexcited  tachycardia  also  occurs  if  an  AP  allows  antegrade  con-
duction  to  the  ventricles  during  AT,  atrial  flutter,  atrial  fibrillation 
(AF),  or  AV  nodal  reentry,  otherwise  known  as  bystander  AP  con-
duction. AF and atrial flutter are potentially life-threatening if the AP 
allows very rapid repetitive conduction (Fig. 249-5).

Approximately  25%  of  APs  causing  preexcitation  allow  minimum 
R-to-R intervals of <250 ms during AF and are associated with a higher 
risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Preexcited 
AF presents as a wide-complex, very irregular rhythm. During AF, the 
ventricular rate is determined by the conduction properties of the AP 
and AV node. The QRS complex can appear quite bizarre and change 
on  a  beat-to-beat  basis  due  to  the  variability  in  the  degree  of  fusion 
from  activation  over  the  AV  node  and  AP,  or  all  beats  may  be  due 
to  conduction  over  the  AP.  Ventricular  activation  from  the  Purkinje 
system  may  depolarize  the  ventricular  aspect  of  the  AP  and  prevent 
atrial wavefront conduction over the AP. Slowing AV nodal conduction 
without slowing AP conduction can thereby facilitate AP conduction 
and  dangerously  accelerate  the  ventricular  rate.  Administration  of 
AV  nodal–blocking  agents,  including  oral  or  intravenous  verapamil, 
diltiazem,  beta  blockers,  intravenous  adenosine,  and  intravenous 
amiodarone, is contraindicated during preexcited AF. Rapid preexcited 
tachycardia should be treated with electrical cardioversion or intrave-
nous procainamide or ibutilide, which may terminate the arrhythmia 
or slow the ventricular rate.

MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH 
ACCESSORY PATHWAYS
Acute management of orthodromic AV reentry is discussed below for 
PSVT. Patients with WPW syndrome may have wide-complex tachy-
cardia  due  to  antidromic  AV  reentry,  orthodromic  AV  with  bundle 
branch block, or a preexcited tachycardia, and treatment depends on 
the underlying rhythm. Initial patient evaluation should include assess-
ment for aggravating factors, including intercurrent illness and factors 
that increase sympathetic tone. Examination should focus on excluding 
underlying heart disease. An echocardiogram is reasonable to exclude 
Ebstein’s anomaly and forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that can 
be associated with APs.

Patients with preexcitation who have symptoms of arrhythmia are 
at  risk  for  developing  AF  and  sudden  death  if  they  have  an  AP  that 
allows rapid antegrade conduction. The risk of cardiac arrest is in the 
range of 2 per 1000 patients in adults but is likely greater in children. 
An invasive electrophysiology study is recommended to assess whether 
the pathway can support dangerously rapid heart rates if AF were to 
occur,  and  it  is  usually  combined  with  potentially  curative  catheter 
ablation.  Catheter  ablation  is  warranted  for  recurrent  arrhythmias

FIGURE  249-5  Preexcited  atrial  fibrillation  (AF)  due  to  conduction  over  a  left  free  wall  accessory  pathway  (AP).  The  electrocardiogram  shows  rapid  irregular  QRS 
complexes that represent fusion between conduction over the atrioventricular node and left free wall AP. Shortest R-R intervals between preexcited QRS complexes of  
<250 ms, as in this case, indicate a risk of sudden death with this arrhythmia.

when drugs are ineffective, not tolerated, or not desired by the patient. 
Efficacy is in the range of 95% depending on the location of the AP. 
Serious  complications  occur  in  <3%  of  patients  but  can  include  AV 
block, cardiac tamponade, thromboembolism, coronary artery injury, 
and vascular access complications. Procedure mortality is <1 in 1000 
patients.  Ambulatory  monitoring  or  exercise  testing  is  often  used  to 
gain reassurance that the AP is not high risk, evaluating for abrupt loss 
of conduction (preexcitation) at physiologic heart rates consistent with 
a low-risk pathway, but this is not completely reliable. Gradual loss of 
AP conduction with increased sympathetic tone does not reliably indi-
cate low risk since this can occur as AV nodal conduction time short-
ens, and therefore, the possibility of rapid antegrade AP conduction is 
not excluded definitively.

For  patients  with  concealed  APs  or  known  low-risk  APs  causing 
orthodromic AVRT, chronic therapy is guided by symptoms and fre-
quency of events. Vagal maneuvers may terminate episodes, as may a 
dose of beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem taken at the onset of an 
episode. Chronic therapy with these agents or flecainide can reduce the 
frequency of episodes in some patients.

Adults who have preexcitation but no arrhythmia symptoms have 
a  risk  of  sudden  death  estimated  to  be  1  per  1000  patient-years. 
Electrophysiology study is usually advised for people in occupations 
for  which  an  arrhythmia  occurrence  would  place  them  or  others  at 
risk, such as police, military, and pilots, or for individuals who desire 

evaluation  for  risk.  Routine  follow-up  without  therapy  is  reasonable 
in  others.  Children  are  at  greater  risk  of  sudden  death,  ~2  per  1000 
patient-years.

TREATMENT
Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia

Acute management of narrow QRS PSVT is guided by the clinical 
presentation. Continuous ECG monitoring should be implemented, 
and  a  12-lead  ECG  should  always  be  obtained  when  possible, 
since  this  may  be  useful  in  determining  the  mechanism.  In  the 
presence  of  hypotension  with  unconsciousness  or  respiratory  dis-
tress, QRS-synchronous direct current cardioversion is warranted, 
but  this  is  rarely  needed,  because  intravenous  adenosine  works 
promptly in most situations (see below). For stable individuals, ini-
tial therapy takes advantage of the fact that most PSVTs are depen-
dent on AV nodal conduction (AV nodal reentry or orthodromic 
AV reentry) and, therefore, likely to respond to sympatholytic and 
vagotonic  maneuvers  and  drugs.  As  these  are  administered,  the 
ECG  should  be  continuously  recorded  because  the  response  can 
establish  the  diagnosis.  AV  block  with  only  transient  slowing  of 
tachycardia  may  expose  ongoing  P  waves,  indicating  AT  or  atrial 
flutter as the mechanism (Fig. 249-6).

Carotid sinus massage is reasonable provided the risk of carotid 
vascular  disease  is  low,  as  indicated  by  absence  of  carotid  bruits 
and  no  prior  history  of  stroke.  A  Valsalva  maneuver  should  be 
attempted  in  cooperative  individuals,  and  if  effective,  the  patient 
can be taught to perform this maneuver as needed. If vagal maneu-
vers  fail  or  cannot  be  performed,  intravenous  adenosine  will  ter-
minate the vast majority of PSVT episodes by transiently blocking 
conduction in the AV node. Adenosine may produce transient chest 
pain,  dyspnea,  and  anxiety.  It  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with 
prior cardiac transplantation due to potential hypersensitivity due 
to surgical sympathetic denervation. It can theoretically aggravate 
bronchospasm.  Adenosine  precipitates  AF,  which  is  usually  brief, 
in up to 15% of patients, so it should be used cautiously in patients 
with  WPW  syndrome  in  whom  AF  may  produce  hemodynamic 
instability. Intravenous beta blockers and calcium channel blockers 
(verapamil or diltiazem) are also effective but may cause hypoten-
sion  before  and  after  arrhythmia  termination  and  have  a  longer 
duration of action. These agents can also be given orally and can be 
taken by the patient on an as-needed basis to slow ventricular rate 
and facilitate termination by Valsalva maneuver.

The differential diagnosis of wide-complex tachycardia includes 
ventricular tachycardia, PSVT with bundle branch block aberrancy, 
and preexcited tachycardia (see above). In general, these should be 
managed  as  ventricular  tachycardia  until  proven  otherwise.  If  the 
tachycardia is regular and the patient is stable, a trial of intravenous 
adenosine is reasonable. Very irregular wide-complex tachycardia is 
most likely preexcited AF or flutter (see above) and should be man-
aged with cardioversion, intravenous procainamide, or ibutilide. If 
the diagnosis of PSVT with aberrancy is unequivocal, as may be the 
case in patients with prior episodes, treatment for PSVT with vagal 
maneuvers  and  adenosine  is  reasonable.  In  all  cases,  continuous 
ECG  monitoring  should  be  implemented,  and  emergency  cardio-
version and defibrillation should be available.

250 Common Atrial Flutter 
and Macroreentrant and 
Multifocal Atrial Tachycardias
William H. Sauer, Paul C. Zei

Macroreentrant atrial tachycardia is due to a large anatomic reentry cir-
cuit, often associated with areas of scar in the atria. Common or typical 
right atrial flutter is due to a circuit pathway around the tricuspid valve 
annulus, bounded anteriorly by the annulus and posteriorly by func-
tional conduction block in the crista terminalis. The wavefront passes 
between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve annulus, known 
as the sub-Eustachian or cavotricuspid isthmus, where it is susceptible 
to interruption by catheter ablation. Thus, common atrial flutter is also 
known  as  cavotricuspid  isthmus-dependent  atrial  flutter.  This  circuit 
most  commonly  revolves  in  a  counterclockwise  direction  (as  viewed 
looking toward the tricuspid annulus from the ventricular apex), which 
produces  the  characteristic  negative  sawtooth  flutter  waves  in  leads 
II, III, and aVF and positive P waves in lead V1. When the direction 
is  reversed,  clockwise  rotation  produces  the  opposite  P-wave  vector 
in those leads. The atrial rate is typically 240–300 beats/min but may 
be slower in the presence of atrial disease or antiarrhythmic drugs. It 
often conducts to the ventricles with 2:1 AV block, creating a regular 
tachycardia at 130–150 beats/min, with P waves that may be difficult to 
discern from the T wave. Maneuvers that increase AV nodal block will 
typically expose flutter waves, allowing diagnosis. AV nodal disease or 
AV nodal–blocking agents may render the conduction ratio between 
atrium  and  ventricle  higher,  resulting  in  more  obvious  flutter  waves 
(Fig. 250-1).

Common right atrial flutter often occurs in association with atrial 
fibrillation and often with atrial scar from senescence or prior cardiac 
surgery.  Right-sided  cardiac  or  pulmonary  vascular  disease  may  also 
predispose  to  common  right  atrial  flutter.  Some  patients  with  atrial 
fibrillation  treated  with  an  antiarrhythmic  drug,  particularly  flecain-
ide, propafenone, or amiodarone, will present with atrial flutter rather 
than  fibrillation,  since  these  agents  slow  atrial  conduction  velocity 
and  can  promote  reentry,  in  addition  to  suppressing  ectopic  atrial  
triggers.

Macroreentrant  atrial  tachycardias  (ATs)  that  are  not  dependent 
on  conduction  through  the  cavotricuspid  isthmus  are  referred  to  as 
atypical atrial flutters. They can occur in either atrium and are almost 
universally associated with areas of atrial scar. Right atrial atypical flut-
ter often occurs after cardiac surgery if an atriotomy is performed in 
the right atrium as part of the surgery. Left atrial flutter and perimitral 
left atrial flutter are commonly seen after extensive left atrial ablation 
for atrial fibrillation or atrial surgery. The clinical presentation is sim-
ilar to common atrial flutter but with different P-wave morphologies. 
They can be difficult to distinguish from focal AT, and in most cases, 
the mechanism can only be confirmed by an electrophysiology study 
(Fig. 250-2).

activation pattern during flutter were obtained during electrophysiologic study and catheter ablation, viewed from the vantage point of the right ventricle through the 
tricuspid valve. Colors refer to local activation time, demonstrating a complete timing of the electrical circuit around the peritricuspid RA.

ATRIAL FLUTTER
Initial  management  of  atrial  flutter  is  similar  to  that  for  atrial  fibril-
lation,  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Chap.  251.  Electrical  cardiover-
sion  is  warranted  for  hemodynamic  instability  or  severe  symptoms. 
Otherwise,  rate  control  can  be  achieved  with  administration  of  AV 
nodal–blocking agents, but this is often more difficult than for atrial 
fibrillation. The risk of thromboembolic events is thought to be similar 
to  that  associated  with  atrial  fibrillation,  and  hence,  management  of 
stroke risk is similar to the approach for atrial fibrillation. Anticoagu-
lation is warranted prior to conversion for episodes >48 h in duration 

and  chronically  for  patients  at  increased  risk  of  thromboembolic 
stroke  based  on  the  CHA2DS2-VASc  scoring  system  (see  Chap.  251 
and Table 251-2).

For  a  first  episode  of  atrial  flutter,  conversion  to  sinus  rhythm 
without subsequent chronic use of an antiarrhythmic drug therapy is 
reasonable. For recurrent episodes, antiarrhythmic drug therapy with 
sotalol, dofetilide, disopyramide, and amiodarone may be considered, 
but  >70%  of  patients  experience  recurrences.  For  recurrent  episodes 
of  common  atrial  flutter,  catheter  ablation  of  the  cavotricuspid  isth-
mus abolishes the arrhythmia in >95% of patients with a low risk of

complications that are largely related to vascular access and rarely heart 
block. Therefore, catheter ablation for atrial flutter can be considered as 
first-line therapy. Approximately 50% of patients presenting with atrial 
flutter develop atrial fibrillation within 5 years after diagnosis, which 
is  an  important  consideration  in  patients  with  a  high-risk  profile  for 
thromboembolism.  In  general,  patients  with  atrial  flutter  are  treated 
identically to those with atrial fibrillation in terms of recommendations 
for anticoagulation for stroke prevention (Fig. 250-3).

MULTIFOCAL ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA
Multifocal AT (MAT) is characterized by a rhythm with at least three 
distinct  P-wave  morphologies  with  rates  typically  between  100  and  
150  beats/min.  Unlike  atrial  fibrillation,  there  are  clear  isoelectric 

intervals between P waves and the atrial rate is slower. The mechanism 
is  likely  triggered  automaticity  from  multiple  atrial  foci.  It  is  usually 
encountered  in  patients  with  chronic  pulmonary  disease  and  acute 
illness (Fig. 250-4).

Therapy for MAT is directed at treating the underlying disease and 
correcting  any  metabolic  abnormalities.  Electrical  cardioversion  is 
ineffective. The calcium channel blockers verapamil or diltiazem may 
slow  the  atrial  and  ventricular  rate.  Patients  with  severe  pulmonary 
disease often do not tolerate beta blocker therapy. MAT may respond to 
amiodarone, but long-term therapy with this agent is usually avoided 
due to its toxicities, particularly pulmonary fibrosis. The associated risk 
of thromboembolism in MAT remains unclear but is not considered to 
be the same as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

251 Atrial Fibrillation

William H. Sauer, Paul C. Zei

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by seem-
ingly  disorganized,  rapid,  and  irregular  atrial  electrical  activation, 
resulting  in  loss  of  organized  atrial  mechanical  contraction.  These 
rapid  and  irregular  electrical  signals  input  into  the  atrioventricular 
(AV)  node,  which  determines  ventricular  activation  and  rate.  The 
conducted ventricular rate is variable, resulting in an irregular, usually 
rapid  ventricular  rate,  ranging  typically  between  110  and  160  beats/
min  in  most.  In  some  patients,  the  sustained  ventricular  rate  can 
exceed 200 beats/min, whereas in others with either high vagal tone or 
AV nodal conduction disease, the ventricular rate may be excessively 
slow (Fig. 251-1).

AF  is  the  most  common  sustained  arrhythmia;  as  a  result,  it  is  a 
major  public  health  issue.  Prevalence  increases  with  age,  with  >95% 
of  AF  patients  >60  years  of  age.  The  prevalence  in  humans  over  age 
80 is ~10%. The lifetime risk of developing AF for men aged 40 years 
old  is  ~25%.  AF  is  slightly  more  common  in  men  than  women  and 
more common in whites than blacks. Risk factors for developing AF in 
addition to age and underlying cardiac disease include hypertension, 
diabetes  mellitus,  cardiac  disease,  family  history  of  AF,  obesity,  and 
sleep-disordered breathing. AF is not a benign condition, with a 1.5- 
to 1.9-fold increased risk of mortality after controlling for underlying 
cardiac  disease.  Perhaps  the  most  important  consequence  of  AF  is  a 
significantly increased risk of stroke compared to the general popula-
tion, causing ~25% of all strokes. The risk of dementia is increased in 
patients with AF, as is the risk of MRI-detected asymptomatic embolic 
infarct. AF, most often when ventricular rate remains uncontrolled for 
prolonged  periods,  increases  the  risk  of  developing  congestive  heart 
failure  and  cardiomyopathy.  Moreover,  as  a  corollary,  patients  with 
underlying  heart  disease,  in  particular  cardiomyopathy  and  conges-
tive heart failure, are at higher risk for developing AF. AF is a marker 
for worsened morbidity and mortality in patients with existing heart 
disease,  although  the  precise  extent  of  the  independent  risk  increase 
associated with AF in heart disease is unclear. AF may, on occasion, be 
associated with an identifiable precipitating factor, such as hyperthy-
roidism, acute alcohol intoxication, myocardial infarction, pulmonary 
embolism, pericarditis, and cardiac surgery, where AF occurs in up to 
30% of patients postoperatively.

AF  is  clinically  most  typically  defined  by  the  pattern  of  episodes. 
Paroxysmal  AF  is  defined  as  a  pattern  of  AF  episodes  that  occur 
spontaneously  and  terminate  with  a  relatively  short  duration,  most 
commonly  defined  as  7  days  or  less.  Persistent  AF  refers  to  AF  that 
occurs  continuously  for  >7  days  but  <1  year,  whereas  long-standing 
persistent AF refers to AF that has been persistent for >1 year. These 
descriptors  for  AF  correlate  with  the  underlying  pathophysiology  of 
AF. AF tends to be a progressive condition, with, at this point, no defin-
itive “cure” that will completely eliminate AF durably in a predictable 
fashion.  The  pathophysiology  of  AF,  however,  remains  incompletely 
understood.  Most  data  support  a  multifactorial  process  that  leads  to 
the  development  of  manifest  AF.  Clinical  and  epidemiologic  studies 
have demonstrated that, in addition to cardiovascular disease, obesity,

FIGURE 251-2  Surface electrocardiogram (ECG) of atrial ectopy initiating atrial fibrillation (AF). In this single-lead surface ECG recording, the tracing begins with two 
conducted sinus beats. A nonconducted premature atrial contraction (PAC) (labeled “blocked PAC”) is shown after the second QRS complex. After the next sinus P wave 
and QRS, an ectopic beat (PAC) initiates atrial fibrillation, as demonstrated by (somewhat organized) erratic atrial activity and an irregular ventricular response.

hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  sleep-disordered  breathing  are 
associated with higher risk of developing AF. The proposed pathophys-
iology suggests a “final common pathway” of these risk factors leading 
to electrophysiologic changes in atrial tissues. Alterations in regulation 
of membrane channels and other proteins result in abnormal electrical 
excitability.  Atrial  tissues,  in  particular  pulmonary  vein  musculature, 
exhibit  enhanced  automaticity,  resulting  in  ectopic  beats  (premature 
atrial contractions), as shown in Fig. 251-2. Bouts of rapid atrial ectopy 
may then initiate either atrial tachycardia or frank AF. Additional cel-
lular and, eventually, tissue remodeling results in abnormal conduction 
properties throughout the atria, including, in particular, shortening of 
atrial  tissue  refractory  periods.  This  enables  sustained  AF  through  a 
combination of rapid automaticity-based “drivers” and areas of func-
tional reentry. Further remodeling leads to the development of fibrosis 
and left atrial enlargement (Table 251-1).

These  functional  and  anatomic  changes  in  atrial  tissues  appear  to 
correlate with the progression of clinical AF. AF tends to be a progres-
sive disease in most, although exceptions occur. Typically, for a period 
of  time,  patients  experience  sporadic  ectopic  beats,  likely  originating 
from the pulmonary veins, preceding the onset of frank AF.

Other  regions  of  the  atria  have  been  demonstrated  to  produce 
ectopic  depolarizations  that  may  trigger  AF;  these  include  the  mus-
cular tissue sleeves within the superior vena cava, coronary sinus, or 
the  remnant  of  the  vein  of  Marshall.  When  enough  frequent  bursts 
of  ectopic  beats/tachycardia  and/or  changes  in  underlying  substrate 
support the maintenance of AF for short periods, the patient develops 
episodes  of  paroxysmal  AF.  In  the  untreated  patient,  over  time,  as 
electrical  and  remodeling  continues  to  progress,  episodes  of  parox-
ysmal  AF  may  be  prolonged  to  the  point  of  not  terminating  spon-
taneously,  the  hallmark  of  persistent  AF.  After  further  remodeling, 
not only do patients continue on to long-standing persistent AF but 

also the efficacy of therapeutic interventions to restore sinus rhythm 
diminishes.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND 
MANIFESTATIONS
The  clinical  manifestations  of  AF  result  from  (1)  symptoms  related 
to the irregular, often rapid but sometimes slow ventricular rates that 
result; (2) the hemodynamic consequences of altered cardiac function; 
(3)  the  consequences  of  cardioembolic  phenomena;  and/or  (4)  the 
impact of AF on cardiovascular function over time. AF is diagnosed by 
electrocardiogram (ECG), either by 12-lead standard ECG or limited 
lead ambulatory monitor ECG, with findings of lack of organized atrial 
activity (no P wave), with an irregular ventricular response. The role 
of screening populations for AF is evolving with the use of wearable 
monitors and home ECG capabilities.

With irregular, rapid ventricular rates, there is variable cardiac dis-
placement  and  contraction,  resulting  in  the  sensation  of  palpitations 
and awareness of the heartbeat, when of course, in a normal rhythm, 
most  humans  do  not  sense  each  and  every  heartbeat.  Interestingly, 
many patients are, for the most part, unaware of the irregular ventric-
ular beating for unknown reasons.

During AF, there is loss of the contribution of atrial systole to overall 
cardiac output and, with irregular ventricular rates, variable ventricular 
filling  and,  as  a  consequence,  variable  stroke  volume.  The  resultant 
impact  on  overall  cardiac  output  may  result  in  exercise  intolerance, 
fatigue, weakness, presyncope, or dyspnea. In patients with underlying 
cardiac  disease,  the  additional  hemodynamic  compromise  resulting 
from AF may result in exacerbation of the disease and/or symptoms. 
Patients  with  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  coronary  artery  disease, 
heart  failure  with  either  depressed  or  preserved  ejection  fraction,  or 
amyloidosis are particularly susceptible. In patients with concomitant

AV  nodal  conduction  disease,  bradycardia  during  AF  may  result  in 
presyncope or syncope. Pauses at the time of spontaneous conversion 
from AF to sinus rhythm, a manifestation of sinus node dysfunction 
that commonly occurs in patients with AF, may result in presyncope 
or syncope as well.

With the loss of atrial mechanical contraction, blood stasis may pro-
mote in situ thrombosis, which, when embolized, may result in a range 
of clinical consequences, most importantly, ischemic stroke. Thrombus 
formation  occurs  primarily  in  the  left  atrial  appendage.  Over  time, 
recurrent thromboembolism to the brain, even if asymptomatic, may 
result in debilitating neurologic sequelae. An increased risk of demen-
tia in patients with AF may be the consequence of this phenomenon.

In  patients  with  prolonged  periods  of  rapid  ventricular  rates 
resulting  from  AF,  there  is  risk  of  developing  a  tachycardia-induced 
cardiomyopathy,  with  associated  depressed  left  ventricular  function. 
Tachycardia-induced myopathy appears generally to be reversible once 
ventricular rates are controlled. In patients with long-standing persis-
tent AF, the atria, especially the left atrium, tend to be more dilated and 
to contain a higher burden of fibrotic, noncontractile atrial tissue. More 
recently, the hemodynamic consequences of a noncompliant, fibrotic 
left  atrium,  including  elevated  left  atrial  filling  pressures,  volume 
overload, and congestive heart failure, have been described as “stiff left 
atrial syndrome.”

TREATMENT
Atrial Fibrillation

The treatment and management of the patient with AF centers on 
three aims: (1) control of patient symptoms through a strategy of 
rate  control  and/or  rhythm  control;  (2)  appropriate  mitigation  of 
thromboembolism risk; and (3) addressing modifiable risk factors 
for progression of AF. In the acute onset of AF, if significant hemo-
dynamic  compromise,  pulmonary  edema,  or  evidence  of  coro-
nary ischemia is present, emergent cardioversion is recommended. 
Electrical cardioversion can be achieved with a QRS synchronous 
shock,  preferably  in  a  sedated  patient,  or  via  pharmacologic  car-
dioversion,  most  typically  with  the  intravenous  administration  of 
the  class  III  antiarrhythmic  ibutilide.  Ibutilide  should  be  avoided 
in patients with baseline prolonged QT interval or severe left ven-
tricular dysfunction, given the risk of torsades des pointes. In the 
hemodynamically stable patient with new-onset AF, therapy should 
focus on control of ventricular rate to prevent hemodynamic seque-
lae,  consideration  of  anticoagulation  to  mitigate  thromboembolic 
risk,  and  consideration  of  restoration  and  maintenance  of  sinus 
rhythm—a so-called rhythm control strategy. If restoration of sinus 
rhythm is being considered, a more immediate risk of thromboem-
bolism  must  be  factored  into  the  management  strategy.  Although 
there is a lack of definitive data, it is presumed that if the presenting 
episode of AF is >48 h or if the episode duration is unknown, there 
is  risk  for  precipitating  a  thromboembolic  complication  through 
cardioversion,  whether  electrical  or  pharmacologically  achieved. 
Therefore,  in  this  circumstance,  the  patient  should  be  either  ini-
tiated  on  anticoagulation,  with  cardioversion  deferred  for  at  least 
4 weeks after uninterrupted anticoagulation, or evaluated to exclude 
the  presence  of  left  atrial  appendage  thrombus.  Most  commonly, 
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used to evaluate for left 
atrial appendage thrombus, although computed tomography (CT) 
angiography  has  been  demonstrated  to  have  excellent  sensitivity 
and specificity as well.

CARDIOVERSION AND ANTICOAGULATION
The major source of thromboembolism and stroke in AF is forma-
tion of thrombus in the left atrial appendage where flow is relatively 
stagnant, although thrombus occasionally forms in other locations 
as well. Following conversion from prolonged AF to sinus rhythm, 
atrial  mechanical  function  can  be  delayed  for  weeks,  such  that 
thrombi  can  form  even  during  sinus  rhythm.  When  AF  has  been 
present for >48 h and in patients at high risk for thromboembolism, 

such as those with mitral stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 
conversion to sinus rhythm is associated with an increased risk of 
thromboembolism.  Thromboembolism  can  occur  soon  or  several 
days after restoration of sinus rhythm if appropriate anticoagulation 
measures are not taken.

Cardioversion within 48 h of the onset of AF is common practice 
in  patients  who  have  not  been  anticoagulated,  provided  that  they 
are  not  at  high  risk  for  stroke  due  to  a  prior  history  of  embolic 
events,  rheumatic  mitral  stenosis,  or  hypertrophic  cardiomyopa-
thy  with  marked  left  atrial  enlargement.  These  low-risk  patients 
with  occasional  episodes  of  AF  can  be  instructed  to  notify  their 
physician when AF occurs to arrange for cardioversion to be done 
within 48 h.

If the duration of AF exceeds 48 h or is unknown, there is greater 
concern for thromboembolism after cardioversion, even in patients 
considered  low  risk  (CHA2DS2-VASc  of  0  or  1  [see  below])  for 
stroke.  There  are  two  approaches  to  mitigate  the  risk  related  to 
cardioversion.  One  option  is  to  anticoagulate  continuously  for   
3 weeks before and a minimum of 4 weeks after cardioversion. A 
second approach is to start anticoagulation and perform a TEE or 
high-resolution cardiac CT scan to detect the presence of thrombus 
in  the  left  atrial  appendage.  If  thrombus  is  absent,  cardioversion 
can  be  performed  and  anticoagulation  continued  for  a  minimum 
of 4 weeks to allow time for recovery of atrial mechanical function. 
In either case, cardioversion of AF is associated with a substantial 
risk  of  recurrence,  which  may  not  be  symptomatic.  Longer-term 
maintenance of anticoagulation is considered based on the patient’s 
individual risk for stroke, commonly assessed using the CHA2DS2-
VASc score.

ACUTE RATE CONTROL
The  goal  of  rate  control  in  AF  is  to  allow  more  diastolic  filling 
time,  improving  cardiac  output  and  reducing  patient  symptoms. 
In the longer term, adequate rate control will minimize the risk of 
congestive  heart  failure  and  tachycardia-induced  cardiomyopathy. 
Acute  rate  control  can  be  achieved  with  beta  blockers  and/or  the 
calcium  channel  blockers  verapamil  and  diltiazem  administered 
either  intravenously  or  orally,  as  warranted  by  the  urgency  of  the 
clinical  situation.  Digoxin  has  been  used  for  many  years  for  rate 
control,  particularly  in  patients  susceptible  to  congestive  heart 
failure, because it lacks the negative inotropic effect seen in calcium 
channel  blockers  and  beta  blockers.  It  acts  synergistically  with 
beta blockers and calcium channel blockers and, therefore, may be 
useful as an added agent when rate control is inadequate. However, 
recent evidence suggests increased mortality with its use, and so its 
utilization has declined.

CHRONIC RATE CONTROL
For patients who remain in AF chronically, the goal of rate control is to 
both alleviate symptoms and prevent deterioration of ventricular func-
tion from excessive rates. β-Adrenergic blockers and calcium channel 
blockers  are  often  used  either  alone  or  in  combination.  Exertion- 
related symptoms are often an indication of inadequate rate control. 
Rate  should  be  assessed  with  exertion  and  medications  adjusted 
accordingly. Adequate rate control is defined as a resting heart rate 
of <80 beats/min that increases to <100 beats/min with light exer-
tion, such as walking. If it is difficult to slow the ventricular rate to 
that degree, allowing a resting rate of up to 110 beats/min is accept-
able provided it does not cause symptoms and ventricular function 
is  normal;  however,  periodic  assessment  of  ventricular  function 
is  warranted  because  some  patients  develop  tachycardia-induced 
cardiomyopathy.

If adequate rate control in AF is difficult to achieve, further con-
sideration should be given to restoring sinus rhythm (see below). 
Catheter ablation of the AV junction to create permanent AV block 
and  implantation  of  a  permanent  pacemaker  reliably  achieve  rate 
control without the need for AV nodal–blocking agents, a so-called 
“ablate and pace” strategy. These patients not only remain in AF but 
also  become  dependent  on  the  pacemaker  to  support  ventricular

rate. The typical pacing configuration with placement of a ventric-
ular lead in the right ventricular apex may induce dyssynchronous 
ventricular activation that can depress ventricular function in some 
patients. Biventricular pacing or direct pacing of the His bundle or 
left bundle branch may be used to minimize the degree of ventric-
ular dyssynchrony.

STROKE PREVENTION IN ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
Thromboembolic complications, in particular, stroke, are the most 
significant  and  potentially  life-threatening  sequelae  of  AF.  There-
fore,  appropriate  stroke  prevention  strategies  are  a  key  aspect  of 
AF management. The mainstay of stroke prevention is continuous 
anticoagulation therapy, most commonly using an oral medication. 
Specific  patient  populations  have  a  high  risk  of  stroke,  includ-
ing  patients  with  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  mitral  stenosis, 
and  prior  stroke  history,  and  therefore,  anticoagulation  is  recom-
mended,  barring  contraindications.  AF  in  patients  without  mitral 
stenosis is commonly referred to as nonvalvular AF. In the majority 
of patients with AF, the decision about whether a stroke prevention 
regimen  is  indicated  is  largely  based  on  an  assessment  of  stroke 
risk,  balanced  by  the  risk  of  the  preventative  therapy.  The  risk  of 
stroke  appears  to  be  most  accurately  predicted  by  the  presence 
of  underlying  risk  factors  known  in  increase  stroke  risk.  The 
CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system (Fig. 251-3) is a widely used tool 
to estimate stroke risk. Anticoagulation is currently recommended 
in the United States for patients with a score of ≥1, unless the lone 
risk  factor  is  female  gender.  Stroke  risk  increases  with  increasing 
CHA2DS2-VASc score, such that annual stroke risk may be as high 
as nearly 20% without anticoagulation. On the other hand, antico-
agulation  carries  a  risk  of  serious  and  potentially  life-threatening 
bleeding complications, in particular, intracranial hemorrhage and 
gastrointestinal  bleed.  Bleeding  risk  is  often  assessed  using  the 
HAS-BLED scoring system (Fig. 251-3). If bleeding risk is deemed

to be outweighed by stroke risk, anticoagulation is recommended. 
It is important to note that the perceived burden of AF has not been 
shown to predict stroke risk. The approach to patients with parox-
ysmal AF is therefore the same as for persistent AF. It is recognized 
that  many  patients  who  appear  to  have  infrequent  AF  episodes 
based  on  office  visits  often  have  asymptomatic  episodes  that  put 
them at risk. Absence of AF during periodic monitoring is not suf-
ficient to indicate low risk. The role of continuous monitoring with 
implanted recorders or pacemakers as a guide for anticoagulation in 
patients with a borderline risk profile is not clear.

The options for anticoagulation are the oral factor Xa inhibitors 
apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban; the oral antithrombin inhibitor 
dabigatran; and the vitamin K antagonist warfarin.

Antiplatelet  agents  alone  are  generally  not  sufficient.  In  non-
valvular  AF,  warfarin  reduces  the  annual  risk  of  stroke  by  64% 
compared to placebo and by 37% compared to antiplatelet therapy. 
Patients  with  AF  with  an  increased  risk  of  stroke  also  have  an 
increased  risk  of  venous  thromboembolism,  which  appears  to  be 
lower  with  oral  anticoagulation.  The  direct-acting  anticoagulants 
dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban were noninferior 
to  warfarin  in  individual  trials  of  nonvalvular  AF  patients,  and 
intent-to-treat analysis of pooled data suggests superiority to warfa-
rin by small absolute margins of 0.4–0.7% in reduction of mortality, 
stroke,  major  bleeding,  and  intracranial  hemorrhage.  Warfarin  is 
required for patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical 
heart valves. The newer, direct-acting anticoagulants have not been 
tested  in  rheumatic  heart  disease,  and  a  direct  thrombin  inhibitor 
did not prevent thromboembolism in patients with mechanical heart 
valves. Warfarin can be an inconvenient agent that requires several 
days to achieve a therapeutic effect (prothrombin time [PT]/interna-
tional normalized ratio [INR] >2), requires monitoring of PT/INR to 
adjust dose, and has many drug and food interactions that can hin-
der patient compliance and render maintaining a therapeutic effect 
challenging. The direct-acting agents are easier to use and achieve 
reliable anticoagulation promptly without requiring dosage adjust-
ment based on blood tests. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban 
have renal excretion, cannot be used with severe renal insufficiency 
(creatinine  clearance  <15  mL/min),  and  require  dose  adjustment 
for modest renal impairment, which is of particular concern in the 
elderly, who are at increased bleeding risk. Limited experience with 
apixaban  demonstrates  safety  and  efficacy  in  patients  undergoing 
chronic  hemodialysis  for  end-stage  kidney  disease.  Excretion  can 
also be influenced by P-glycoprotein inducers and inhibitors. Warfa-
rin anticoagulation can be reversed by administration of fresh frozen 
plasma, prothrombin complex concentrate, and vitamin K. Reversal 
agents are available for dabigatran (idarucizumab), and Xa inhibitors 
are  available  (andexanet  alfa),  and  both  are  administered  intrave-
nously.  These  agents  may  be  pro-thrombotic  and  administration 
must be judicious. The antiplatelet agents aspirin and clopidogrel are 
inferior to warfarin for stroke prevention in AF and do not have less 
risk  of  bleeding.  Clopidogrel  combined  with  aspirin  is  better  than 
aspirin alone for stroke prevention, but this combination is inferior 
to warfarin and has a greater bleeding risk than aspirin alone.

Bleeding  is  the  major  risk  of  anticoagulation.  Major  bleeding 
requiring  transfusion  and  intracranial  bleeding  occur  in  ~1%  of 
patients per year with warfarin. Direct-acting anticoagulants appear 
to have a lower risk of intracranial bleeding compared with warfarin 
without  sacrificing  protective  effects  against  thromboembolism. 
Risk  factors  for  bleeding  include  age  >65–75  years,  heart  failure, 
renal  insufficiency,  prior  bleeding,  and  excessive  alcohol  or  non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. In patients who require dual 
antiplatelet  therapy  (e.g.,  aspirin  and  clopidogrel)  after  coronary 
or  peripheral  arterial  stenting,  there  is  a  substantially  increased 
bleeding risk when standard oral anticoagulation with warfarin or 
a  direct-acting  anticoagulant  is  added.  The  optimal  combination 
of agents for patients with AF who also require antiplatelet therapy 
remains unclear.

Chronic  anticoagulation  is  contraindicated  in  some  patients 
due to bleeding risks. Because most atrial thrombi likely originate

combined with atrial maze surgery, may be considered for patients 
undergoing  surgery,  although  removal  of  the  appendage  has  not 
been unequivocally shown to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. 
Percutaneously deployed devices that occlude or ligate the left atrial 
appendage are also available, appear to be noninferior to warfarin in 
reducing stroke risk, and are considered in patients who have a high 
risk  of  thromboembolism  but  serious  bleeding  risk  from  chronic 
oral anticoagulation (Table 251-2).

RHYTHM CONTROL
The decision to administer antiarrhythmic drugs or perform cath-
eter ablation to attempt maintenance of sinus rhythm (commonly 
referred  to  as  the  rhythm  control  strategy)  is  mainly  guided  by 
patient symptoms and preferences regarding the benefits and risks 
of therapies. In general, patients who maintain sinus rhythm have 
better  survival  than  those  who  continue  to  have  AF.  This  may 
be because continued AF is a marker of disease severity. In older 
randomized  trials,  administration  of  antiarrhythmic  medications 
to  maintain  sinus  rhythm  did  not  improve  survival  or  symptoms 
compared  to  a  rate  control  strategy,  and  the  drug  therapy  group 
had more hospitalizations. Disappointing efficacy and toxicities of 
available  antiarrhythmic  drugs  and  patient  selection  bias  may  be 
factors  that  influenced  the  results  of  these  trials.  Recently,  a  ran-
domized trial evaluating an early rhythm control strategy (within 
1  year  of  initial  presentation)  compared  to  standard  rate  control 
demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events, including death 
from  cardiovascular  causes  and  stroke.  Differences  between  this 
study and earlier randomized trials that failed to show a significant 
difference in outcomes in rate versus rhythm control included the 
use of catheter ablation and a high adherence rate to anticoagula-
tion despite apparent rhythm control. In patients with heart failure 
due to depressed left ventricular function, a catheter ablation–based 
strategy to maintain sinus rhythm appears to provide mortality ben-
efit compared with a medical rhythm control strategy. In a broader 
population  of  patients  with  AF,  a  large,  randomized,  prospective 
study  comparing  catheter  ablation  rhythm  control  medications 
demonstrated  a  nonsignificant  trend  toward  reduced  hospitaliza-
tions and improved mortality, mostly driven by patients with heart 
failure.

A  rhythm  control  strategy  is  usually  selected  for  patients  with 
symptomatic  paroxysmal  AF,  recurrent  episodes  of  symptomatic 
persistent  AF,  AF  with  difficult  rate  control,  and  AF  that  has 
resulted in depressed ventricular function or that aggravates heart 
failure.  A  rhythm  control  strategy  is  more  likely  to  be  favored  in 
younger patients than in sedentary or elderly patients in whom rate 
control is more easily achieved. Even if sinus rhythm is apparently 
maintained,  anticoagulation  is  recommended  according  to  the 
CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk profile because asymptomatic episodes 
of  AF  are  common.  Following  a  first  episode  of  persistent  AF,  a 
strategy using AV nodal–blocking agents, cardioversion, and anti-
coagulation is reasonable, in addition to addressing possible aggra-
vating factors. If recurrences are infrequent, periodic cardioversion 
is  reasonable.  However,  if  a  patient  has  frequent  symptomatic  AF 
despite rate control, then a rhythm control strategy incorporating 
catheter  ablation  and/or  antiarrhythmic  medications  is  indicated. 

Based  on  recent  randomized  trial  data  demonstrating  superiority 
of ablation over medications for maintenance of sinus rhythm and 
benefits of an early rhythm control strategy, there is a trend toward 
offering  ablation  earlier  in  the  course  of  treatment,  especially  for 
individuals with paroxysmal AF.
Pharmacologic Therapy for Maintaining Sinus Rhythm  The goal 
of  pharmacologic  therapy  is  to  maintain  sinus  rhythm  or  reduce 
episodes of AF. Risks and side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs are 
a  major  consideration  in  selecting  therapy.  Drug  therapy  can  be 
instituted  once  sinus  rhythm  has  been  established  or  in  anticipa-
tion  of  cardioversion.  However,  antiarrhythmic  medications  may 
in  some  instances  pharmacologically  cardiovert  the  patient  into 
sinus  rhythm.  Therefore,  an  appropriate  anticoagulation  strategy 
approach similar to electrical cardioversion is recommended, par-
ticularly at the time of initiation of therapy. β-Adrenergic blockers 
and calcium channel blockers help control ventricular rate, improve 
symptoms, and possess a low-risk profile, but have low efficacy for 
preventing  or  terminating  AF  episodes.  Class  I  sodium  channel–
blocking  agents  (e.g.,  flecainide,  propafenone,  disopyramide)  are 
options for patients without significant structural heart disease, but 
negative  inotropic  and  proarrhythmic  effects  warrant  avoidance 
in patients with coronary artery disease or heart failure. The class 
III  agents  sotalol  and  dofetilide  can  be  administered  to  patients 
with  coronary  artery  disease  or  structural  heart  disease  but  have 
~3% risk of inducing excessive QT prolongation and torsades des 
pointes. Dofetilide should be initiated only in a hospital with ECG 
monitoring, and many physicians take this approach with sotalol as 
well. Dronedarone increases mortality in patients with heart failure 
or  long-standing  persistent  AF.  All  of  these  agents  have  modest 
efficacy  in  patients  with  paroxysmal  AF,  of  whom  ~30–50%  will 
benefit.  Amiodarone  is  more  effective,  maintaining  sinus  rhythm 
in approximately two-thirds of patients. It can be administered to 
patients  with  heart  failure  and  coronary  artery  disease.  However, 
>40%  of  patients  experience  amiodarone-related  toxicities  during 
long-term  therapy,  and  thus,  careful  monitoring  of  potential  tox-
icities,  including  liver,  lung,  and  thyroid  abnormalities,  must  be 
accompanied with this therapy.
Catheter  And  Surgical  Ablation  for  Maintaining  Sinus  Rhythm   
Successful catheter ablation avoids antiarrhythmic drug toxicities, 
but  procedural  risks  and  efficacy  depend  on  operator  experience. 
For  patients  with  previously  untreated  but  recurrent  paroxysmal 
AF, catheter ablation has superior efficacy compared to antiarrhyth-
mic drug therapy, and ablation is even more clearly superior to anti-
arrhythmic drugs for patients who have recurrent AF despite drug 
treatment. Long-term control of AF is more difficult to achieve in 
patients with persistent AF, likely because of more extensive atrial 
abnormalities and associated greater comorbidities in these patients 
(Fig. 251-4).

Catheter ablation involves percutaneous venous access (typically 
via the femoral veins), trans(atrial) septal puncture, and radiofre-
quency ablation or cryoablation to electrically isolate the left atrial 
regions  around  the  pulmonary  vein  antra,  abolishing  the  ability 
of  triggering  foci  in  these  regions  to  initiate  AF  and  also  likely 
impacting  the  substrate  for  reentry  in  the  left  atrium.  Extensive 
areas  of  ablation  are  required,  and  gaps  in  healed  ablation  areas

or  emergence  of  new  trigger  sites  outside  the  pulmonary  veins 
necessitate a repeat procedure in 10–30% of patients. Several alter-
native energy sources to create ablative lesions are being evaluated 
for ablation of AF and other arrhythmias, including laser, external 
beam radiation, and pulsed field electroporation.

In patients with paroxysmal AF, sinus rhythm is maintained for 
>1 year after a single ablation procedure in ~70% of patients and 
is achieved in >90% of patients after multiple procedures in some 
studies. Many patients become more responsive to antiarrhythmic 
drugs or become less symptomatic with a reduced AF burden after 
a  pulmonary  vein  isolation  procedure,  and  thus,  repeat  ablation 
may not be required for symptom control in some. Ablation is less 
effective in patients with persistent AF, particularly long-standing 

persistent AF, especially when associated with more extensive car-
diac disease, comorbidities, and evidence of left atrial enlargement. 
More extensive ablation is often required, targeting areas that likely 
support  reentry  and/or  AF  maintenance  and  regions  outside  but 
adjacent to the pulmonary venous antra. There is no proven strat-
egy for selecting ablation targets outside the pulmonary vein antral 
regions, and a variety of approaches have been pursued. Ablation 
of areas of rapid activity during AF and creation of ablation lines to 
block conduction across regions of the atria have not been proven 
to improve outcomes in unselected patients. Other ablation targets 
include non–pulmonary vein foci that fire in response to high-dose 
isoproterenol,  areas  of  atrial  fibrosis,  and  regions  with  repetitive 
rotational  or  focal  activation  during  AF.  More  than  one  ablation

FIGURE  251-5  Rhythm  control  strategy  for  symptomatic  atrial  fibrillation  (AF).  This  chart  outlines  the  guideline-based  management  of  patients  with  symptomatic  atrial 
fibrillation. As outlined in Table 251-1, the first step is determination of the temporal nature of the patient’s AF (paroxysmal vs persistent) and any associated risk factors for AF 
recurrence, such as left atrial anatomic dimensions. A decision is then made regarding medical versus catheter ablation–based rhythm control, with recommendations for 
when to consider catheter ablation based on guideline recommendations (class IIa for paroxysmal, IIb for persistent without major risks for recurrence, or AF of any sort in 
patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [EF], class I). Note the importance of patient choice, as well as the subsequent decisions to consider catheter ablation 
if drugs have failed. (G Hindricks et al: 2020 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European Association of 
Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS). Eur Heart J 42:17, 2020. (Translated and) Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.)

procedure  is  often  required  to  maintain  sinus  rhythm  in  patients 
with persistent and long-standing persistent AF because of lack of 
lesion durability and complex atrial substrate with non–pulmonary 
vein sources that may be incompletely treated at the initial ablation 
session (Fig. 251-5).

Catheter  ablation  has  a  2–7%  risk  of  major  procedure-related 
complications, with the long-term trend suggesting steady improve-
ment  in  complication  rates.  Complication  rates  are  clearly  lowest 
with high-volume operators and centers. Complications including 
stroke  (0.5–1%),  cardiac  tamponade  (1%),  phrenic  nerve  paral-
ysis,  bleeding  from  femoral  access  sites,  and  fluid  overload  with 
heart  failure,  which  can  emerge  1–3  days  after  the  procedure.  It 
is  important  to  recognize  the  potential  for  delayed  presentation 
of  some  complications.  Ablation  within  the  PV  can  lead  to  PV 
stenosis,  presenting  weeks  to  months  after  the  procedure  with 
dyspnea  or  hemoptysis.  The  esophagus  abuts  the  posterior  wall 
of  the  left  atrium  where  it  is  subject  to  injury,  and  esophageal 
ulcers  can  form  immediately  after  the  procedure  and  may  rarely 
lead  to  a  fistula  between  the  left  atrium  and  esophagus  (esti-
mated incidence of <0.1%) that presents as endocarditis and stroke  
10  days  to  3  weeks  after  the  procedure.  Early  diagnosis  of  atri-
oesophageal fistula is important because delayed diagnosis leads to 
likely death. Diagnosis is made by chest CT scan with water-soluble 
oral  and  IV  contrast.  Endoscopy  should  be  avoided  in  patients 
with a suspected fistula because of the risk of air/esophageal fluid 
embolus. Definitive repair of the atrioesophageal fistula with emer-
gent surgery is required.

Surgical  ablation  of  AF  is  most  frequently  performed  con-
comitant  with  cardiac  valve  or  coronary  artery  surgery  and  less 
commonly as a stand-alone procedure. However, for patients with 
persistent AF, surgical or hybrid procedures (a combination of a 
surgical and catheter-based approach, most often in separate pro-
cedures) appear to have comparable efficacy to catheter ablation. 
Risks include sinus node injury requiring pacemaker implantation 
and higher morbidity with surgical ablation. Surgical removal of 
the left atrial appendage may reduce stroke risk, although throm-
bus can form in the remnant of the appendage or if the appendage 
is not completely ligated.

RISK FACTORS FOR AND LIFESTYLE 
IMPACT ON ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
There is strong evidence that AF is associated with obesity, hyperten-
sion, alcohol use, and sleep apnea. Aggressive treatment of these risk 
factors  can  substantially  reduce  AF  episodes  in  some  patients  and  is 
warranted in all patients, as additional benefits to the patient are likely 
beyond  AF  improvement.  The  amount  of  exercise  appears  to  have  a 
complex  relationship  with  the  risk  of  AF  development.  In  males,  a 
U-shaped curve exists, where AF risk is high among those with sed-
entary  lifestyles  and  those  who  participate  extensively  in  endurance 
athletics such as long-distance running or cycling. Moderate exercise 
appears to confer a lower risk of AF. On the other hand, in females, a 
linear relationship exists between exercise and AF risk, with risk of AF 
decreasing  continuously  with  increasing  exercise  activity.  Although 
caffeine intake is often invoked as a risk for AF development or as a 
trigger for AF episodes in patients with a known AF diagnosis, large 
cohort studies have demonstrated, in contrast, a modest decrease in AF 
risk with modest caffeine intake. Other proposed risk factors are being 
evaluated, including psychological stress. Genetic predisposition to AF 
is seen in those with first-degree relatives with AF, and a small subset of 
AF patients can be determined have a familial form of AF.

There  is  emerging  emphasis  on  an  integrated  approach  to  man-
agement of AF patients, with coordinated management of risk factor 
modification,  stroke  prevention,  rate  control,  rhythm  control,  and 
management of associated comorbidities of critical importance.

TYPES OF VAs
VAs can arise from focal sites of origin or from reentrant circuits. 
Focal VAs can originate from myocardial or Purkinje cells capable 
of  automaticity  or  triggered  activity.  Reentrant  VAs  often  involve 
areas of scar such as old myocardial infarction or a cardiomyopathic 
process.  Less  commonly,  diseased  Purkinje  conduction  pathways 
can also result in reentrant circuits. VAs are characterized by their 
electrocardiographic  appearance  and  duration.  Conduction  away 
from  the  ventricular  focus  or  reentrant  circuit  exit,  propagating 
through  the  ventricular  myocardium,  is  slower  than  activation  of 
the ventricles over the normal Purkinje system. For this reason, the 
QRS complex duration during VAs will be wide, typically >0.12 s, 
though there are unusual situations that can arise with narrow QRS 
duration as well.

Premature ventricular beats (also referred to as a premature ventric-
ular  contractions  [PVCs])  are  single  ventricular  beats  that  fall  earlier 
than the next anticipated supraventricular beat (Fig. 252-1). PVCs that 
originate  from  the  same  focus  will  have  the  same  QRS  morphology 
and are referred to as unifocal (Fig. 252-1A). PVCs that originate from 
different  ventricular  sites  have  different  QRS  morphologies  and  are 
referred  to  as  multifocal  (Fig.  252-1B).  Two  consecutive  ventricular 
beats are ventricular couplets.

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is three or more consecutive beats at 
a  rate  faster  than  100  beats/min.  Three  or  more  consecutive  beats  at 
slower rates are designated an idioventricular rhythm. VT that termi-
nates  spontaneously  within  30  s  is  designated  nonsustained,  whereas 
sustained VT persists for >30 s or is terminated by an active interven-
tion,  such  as  administration  of  an  intravenous  medication,  external 
cardioversion,  antitachycardia  pacing,  or  a  shock  from  an  implanted 
cardioverter defibrillator (Fig. 252-2).

252 Approach to Ventricular 
Arrhythmias
William H. Sauer, Usha B. Tedrow

There are myriad types of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), affecting patients 
with normal hearts and those with structural heart disease ranging from 
benign  to  life-threatening.  An  understanding  of  an  approach  to  these 
arrhythmias  is  critical  to  being  appropriately  parsimonious  with  benign 
forms, while understanding an approach to the malignant forms.

FIGURE 252-2  Repetitive monomorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) of right ventricular outflow tract origin. The VT has a left bundle branch block pattern 
with inferior axis with tall QRS complexes in the inferior leads.

Monomorphic  VT  has  the  same  QRS  complex  from  beat  to  beat, 
indicating that the activation sequence is the same from beat to beat 
and that each beat likely originates from the same source (Fig. 252-3A). 
The initial site of ventricular activation largely determines the sequence 
of ventricular activation. Therefore, the QRS morphology of PVCs and 
monomorphic VT provides an indication of the site of origin within 
the ventricles (Fig. 252-4). The likely origin often suggests whether an 
arrhythmia is idiopathic or associated with structural disease. Arrhyth-
mias  that  originate  from  the  right  ventricle  or  septum  result  in  late 
activation of much of the left ventricle, thereby producing a prominent 
S wave in V1 referred to as a left bundle branch block–like configura-
tion. Arrhythmias that originate from the free wall of the left ventricle 
have a prominent positive deflection in V1, thereby producing a right 
bundle branch block–like morphology in V1. The frontal plane axis of 
the QRS is also useful. An axis that is directed inferiorly, as indicated 
by dominant R waves in lead II, III, and AVF, suggests initial activation 
of the cranial portion of the ventricle, whereas a frontal plane axis that 
is directed superiorly (dominant S waves in II, III, and AVF) suggests 
initial activation at the inferior wall.

Very  rapid  monomorphic  VT  has  a  sinusoidal  appearance,  also 
called  ventricular  flutter,  because  it  is  not  possible  to  distinguish  the 
QRS complex from the T wave (Fig. 252-3B). Relatively slow sinusoidal 
VTs  have  a  wide  QRS  indicative  of  slowed  ventricular  conduction 
(Fig. 252-3C).  Hyperkalemia,  toxicity  from  excessive  effects  of  drugs 
that block sodium channels (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, or tricyclic 
antidepressants),  and  severe  global  myocardial  ischemia  are  possible 
causes.

Polymorphic VT has a continually changing QRS morphology indi-
cating  a  changing  ventricular  activation  sequence.  Polymorphic  VT 
that occurs in the context of congenital or acquired prolongation of the 
QT interval often has a waxing and waning QRS amplitude, creating a 
characteristic shifting axis referred to as torsades des pointes after the 
classic ballet sequence (Fig. 252-3D).

Ventricular fibrillation (VF) has continuous irregular activation with 
no  discrete  QRS  complexes.  Monomorphic  or  polymorphic  VT  may 
transition to VF in susceptible patients. Cardiac ischemia is the most 
common cause of VF (Fig. 252-3E).

The term idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia generally refers to PVCs 
or VT that occurs in patients with a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), 

without structural heart disease, and not associated with an underlying 
genetic syndrome or risk of sudden death.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Common  symptoms  of  VAs  include  palpitations,  dizziness,  exercise 
intolerance,  episodes  of  lightheadedness,  syncope,  or  sudden  cardiac 
arrest  leading  to  sudden  death  if  not  resuscitated.  VAs  can  also  be 
asymptomatic  and  encountered  unexpectedly  as  an  irregular  pulse 
or  heart  sounds  on  examination  or  may  be  seen  on  a  routine  ECG, 
exercise  test,  or  cardiac  ECG  monitoring.  Occasionally  when  every 
other beat is a PVC (bigeminy), pulse measurements for heart rate can 
be  erroneously  low  (pseudobradycardia)  because  the  PVCs  may  not 
generate a separate pulse wave.

Syncope  is  a  concerning  symptom,  particularly  when  occurring 
without prodrome, during exercise, or in the setting of abnormal ECG 
or structural heart disease. Such episodes can be due to VT that pro-
duces severe hypotension, warranting concern for risk of cardiac arrest 
and sudden death with arrhythmia recurrence. Although benign pro-
cesses such as reflex-mediated neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) episodes 
and orthostatic hypotension are the most common causes of syncope, 
it is important to consider the possibility of underlying heart disease 
or a genetic syndrome causing VT. When these are suspected, hospi-
talization for further evaluation and monitoring is often appropriate.

Sustained  VT  may  present  as  a  wide  QRS  complex  tachycardia 
that  must  be  distinguished  from  supraventricular  tachycardia  with 
aberrancy (Chap. 246). Symptoms can be minor but more commonly 
include  hypotension  with  syncope  and  even  imminent  cardiac  arrest. 
Sustained VT may degenerate to VF, particularly if it is rapid and poly-
morphic. Many patients who are at risk for VT have known heart dis-
ease, and many have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). In 
patients with an ICD, VT episodes may cause transient lightheadedness, 
palpitations, or syncope followed by a shock from the ICD (see below).

EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH 
DOCUMENTED OR SUSPECTED 
VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS
There  are  several  important  considerations  that  guide  evaluation  of 
patients  with  documented  or  suspected  cardiac  arrhythmias.  First, 
establish  whether  a  VA  is  the  cause  of  the  symptoms  or  clinical

presentation. Second, determine whether the arrhythmia is associated 
with a cardiac disease, and establish the prognostic significance of that 
disease and, in particular, whether it is associated with a risk of sudden 
cardiac death. Finally, define the likelihood of arrhythmia recurrence 
and  the  symptoms  and  risk  imposed  by  the  recurrence.  The  risks  of 
cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death are largely determined by the 
cause of the arrhythmia and the associated underlying heart disease.

The diagnosis of VAs can be established by recording the arrhythmia 
on  an  ECG,  by  an  ambulatory  or  implanted  cardiac  monitor,  by  an 
implanted rhythm management device such as a pacemaker or ICD, or 
in some cases, initiation of the arrhythmia during an electrophysiologic 
study. A 12-lead ECG of the arrhythmia should be obtained when pos-
sible and often provides clues to the potential site of origin and possible 
presence of underlying heart disease (see above) (Fig. 252-4).

For patients with sustained wide-complex tachycardia, initial man-
agement is guided by the patient’s hemodynamic stability. The approach 

to sustained wide-complex tachycardia is discussed in Chap. 254. The 
management  of  VT  that  causes  cardiac  arrest  is  discussed  in  Chap. 
306. Once hemodynamic stability is restored, further management is 
guided  by  the  possibility  of  a  recurrence  and  the  risk  imposed  by  a  
recurrence.

 ■ EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT WITH 
ARRHYTHMIA SYMPTOMS
When symptoms are intermittent, initial evaluation aims to establish 
symptom  severity,  provocative  factors,  and  presence  of  underlying 
heart disease. Syncope or near syncope raises concern that an arrhyth-
mia is causing episodes of hypotension and that there may be a risk of 
cardiac arrest. Symptoms that occur with exertion suggest arrhythmias 
that are provoked by sympathetic stimulation but can also be related to 
exertional ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease, although 
non-arrhythmia causes must also be considered. A past history of any 
cardiac  disease  is  important.  A  review  of  all  medications  is  relevant. 
Medications that prolong the QT interval predispose to polymorphic 
VT (Chap. 255). Adrenergic stimulants can provoke PVCs.

Family  history  should  determine  the  presence  of  premature  coro-
nary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, or cardiac arrhythmias, particu-
larly a history of sudden death. Family history may also suggest that a 
possibility of a genetic cause of an arrhythmia warrants careful consid-
eration. Details of premature deaths are relevant. Sudden death victims 
are often said to have died of a “massive heart attack” despite absence 
of definite confirmation of thrombotic myocardial infarction and when 
other causes such as arrhythmia may have been possible.

The  physical  examination  focuses  on  evidence  of  structural  heart 
disease with assessment of pulse, jugular venous pressure lung fields, 
and  cardiac  auscultation.  Stigmata  of  neuromuscular  disease  or  dys-
morphic features may suggest a genetic arrhythmia syndrome.

A 12-lead ECG should be obtained even if the patient is not having 
symptoms at the time of evaluation. Occasionally, premature ventricu-
lar beats will be detected. Patients with benign idiopathic arrhythmias 
usually  have  a  completely  normal  ECG  during  sinus  rhythm.  Any 
ECG  abnormality  warrants  further  evaluation.  Particularly  relevant 
findings  include  Q  waves  that  indicate  prior  myocardial  infarction, 
which may have been silent, and ventricular hypertrophy, which may 
indicate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or other ventricular disease. An 
ECG finding is the major diagnostic manifestation of several genetic 
arrhythmia  syndromes  in  patients  without  structural  heart  disease, 
including  the  long  QT  syndrome,  Brugada  syndrome,  and  short  QT 
syndrome.

If there is suspicion for structural heart disease, cardiac imaging is 
warranted to assess ventricular function and structure. Transthoracic 
echocardiography  is  most  frequently  employed  for  initial  evaluation. 
Depressed ventricular function increases concern for a risk of sudden 
death  and  warrants  further  evaluation  to  establish  the  cause,  which 
may  be  cardiomyopathy,  coronary  artery  disease,  or  valvular  heart 
disease.  Ventricular  thickening  may  indicate  hypertrophic  cardiomy-
opathy or infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis. Cardiac MRI with 
gadolinium contrast imaging provides similar assessment but also can 
detect areas of ventricular scar, evident as regions of delayed hyperen-
hancement, which are usually present in patients who have sustained 
monomorphic VT (Fig. 252-5). The nature and location of abnormal-
ities  are  helpful  in  assessing  the  type  of  heart  disease.  Evaluation  to 
exclude  atherosclerotic  coronary  artery  disease  should  be  performed 
in patients at risk, guided by age and other risk factors.

 ■ TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR  
VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS
Treatment of VAs is guided by the severity and frequency of symptoms. 
For  some,  reassurance  and  removal  of  aggravating  factors  (e.g.,  caf-
feine) are all that is needed. For arrhythmias associated with a sudden 
death  risk,  ICD  implantation  is  usually  indicated  and  will  provide  a 
“safety net” to terminate life-threatening VT or VF, preventing sudden 
death  but  without  preventing  the  arrhythmia.  When  suppression  of 
the  arrhythmia  is  required,  antiarrhythmic  drug  therapy  or  catheter 
ablation is a major consideration.

 ■ ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS
Use of antiarrhythmic drugs is based on consideration of the risks and 
potential benefit for the individual patient. Efficacy and side effects for 
the individual patient are not predictable and are assessed by individ-
ual therapeutic trial. Adverse effects are mostly noncardiac and minor 
but can sometimes be severe enough to limit their use. Cardiac side 
effects, however, include the potential for “proarrhythmia,” whereby a 
drug can increase the frequency of arrhythmia or cause a new arrhyth-
mia.  Aggravation  of  bradyarrhythmias  is  also  a  common  concern. 
Although antiarrhythmic drugs are classified based on their actions on 
receptors or ion channels, most have multiple effects, affecting more 
than one channel.

 ■ β-ADRENERGIC BLOCKERS
Many  VAs  are  sensitive  to  sympathetic  stimulation, 
and  β-adrenergic  stimulation  also  diminishes  the 
electrophysiologic  effects  of  many  membrane-active 
antiarrhythmic drugs. The safety of β-blocking agents 
makes them the first choice of therapy for most VAs. 
They  are  particularly  useful  for  exercise-induced 
arrhythmias  and  idiopathic  arrhythmias  but  have 
limited efficacy for most arrhythmias associated with 
heart  disease.  Bradyarrhythmias  and  negative  ino-
trophic effects are the major cardiac adverse effects.
 ■ CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS
The  nondihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blockers 
diltiazem  and  verapamil  can  be  effective  for  some 
idiopathic VTs. The risk of proarrhythmia is low, but 
they have negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects 
that can aggravate hypotension.
 ■ SODIUM CHANNEL–BLOCKING 
AGENTS
Drugs  whose  major  effect  is  mediated  through 
sodium  channel  blockade  include  mexiletine,  qui-
nidine,  disopyramide,  flecainide,  and  propafenone, 
which are available for chronic oral therapy. Blockade 
of the fast inward sodium current has been referred 
to  as  a  class  I  antiarrhythmic  drug  effect.  Antiar-
rhythmic actions are the result of depressing cardiac 
conduction  and  membrane  excitability.  Conduction 
slowing  can  be  manifest  as  a  prolongation  of  QRS 
duration.  Lidocaine,  quinidine,  and  procainamide 
are available as intravenous formulations. Quinidine, 
disopyramide, and procainamide also have potassium 
channel–blocking effects that prolong the QT interval 
(class III antiarrhythmic drug action), contributing to 
their antiarrhythmic effect. These agents have potential proarrhythmic 
effects and, with the possible exception of quinidine, also have negative 
inotropic effects that may have contributed to the increased mortality 
observed  when  some  were  administered  chronically  to  patients  with 
prior myocardial infarction. Long-term therapy is generally avoided in 
patients with structural heart disease but may be used to reduce symp-
tomatic arrhythmias in patients with ICDs.
 ■ POTASSIUM CHANNEL BLOCKING AGENTS
Sotalol and dofetilide block the delayed rectifier potassium channel IKr, 
thereby prolonging action potential duration (QT interval) and the car-
diac refractory period, known as the class III antiarrhythmic drug effect. 
Sotalol also has nonselective β-adrenergic–blocking activity. It has been

shown to have a modest effect on reducing ICD shocks due to ventricular 
and atrial arrhythmias. Proarrhythmia due to the polymorphic VT tor-
sade de pointe that is associated with QT prolongation occurs in 3–5% of 
patients. Both sotalol and dofetilide are excreted via the kidneys, neces-
sitating dose adjustment or avoidance in renal insufficiency. These drugs 
must be avoided in patients with other risk factors for torsade de pointe, 
including QT prolongation, hypokalemia, and significant bradycardia.

 ■ AMIODARONE
Amiodarone  blocks  multiple  cardiac  ionic  currents  and  has  sym-
patholytic  activity.  It  is  the  most  effective  antiarrhythmic  drug  for 
suppressing VAs. It is administered intravenously for life-threatening 
arrhythmias.  During  chronic  oral  therapy,  electrophysiologic  effects 
develop over several days. It is more effective than sotalol in reducing 
ICD shocks and is often used for VAs in patients with heart disease. 
Bradyarrhythmias  are  the  major  cardiac  adverse  effect.  Ventricular 
proarrhythmia  can  occur,  but  torsade  de  pointe  VT  is  rare.  Noncar-
diac  toxicities  are  a  major  problem  and  contribute  to  drug  discon-
tinuation  in  at  least  a  third  of  patients  during  long-term  therapy. 
Hyper-  and  hypothyroidism  are  related  to  the  iodine  content  of  the 
drug.  Pneumonitis  or  pulmonary  fibrosis  occurs  in  ~1%  of  patients. 
Photosensitivity  is  common,  and  neuropathy  and  ocular  toxicity  can 
occur. Systematic monitoring is recommended during chronic therapy 
including assessment for thyroid, liver, and pulmonary toxicity. Intra-
venous administration of amiodarone via a peripheral vein for >24 h 
can cause severe peripheral thrombophlebitis. Dronedarone has struc-
tural similarities to amiodarone but without the iodine moiety. Efficacy 
for VAs is poor, and dronedarone increases mortality in patients with 
heart failure, so dronedarone is not typically used for treatment of VAs.

 ■ IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS
ICDs  detect  sustained  VT,  largely  based  on  heart  rate,  and  then  ter-
minate the arrhythmia. In transvenous devices, VF is terminated by a 
shock applied between a lead in the right ventricle and the ICD pulse 
generator. The lead can provide pacing for bradycardia if needed. This 

transvenous form of ICD has the disadvantages of vascular occlusion, 
risk  of  lead  fracture,  endocarditis  in  the  event  of  infection,  and  dif-
ficulty  with  removal.  Monomorphic  VT  can  also  be  terminated  by  a 
burst  of  rapid  pacing  faster  than  the  VT,  known  as  antitachycardia 
pacing  (ATP)  (Fig.  252-6A).  If  ATP  fails  or  is  not  a  programmed 
treatment, as is often the case for rapid VT or VF, a shock is delivered 
(Fig. 252-6B). ICDs can also be subcutaneous, without a transvenous 
lead. The rhythm is also sensed by this lead, in a manner similar to a 
surface ECG. The lead is placed overlying the left chest with a coil par-
allel to the sternum. Only shocks can be delivered from a subcutaneous 
ICD, and pacing is not possible. No matter the type of ICD, shocks are 
painful if the patient is conscious. ICDs are highly effective for termi-
nation of VT. The most common ICD complication is the delivery of 
unnecessary therapy (either ATP or shocks) in response to an inappro-
priately detected rapid supraventricular tachycardia or electrical noise 
as a result of an ICD lead fracture or electromagnetic interference from 
an external source. ICDs record and store electrograms from arrhyth-
mia episodes that can be retrieved by interrogation of the ICD, which 
can  be  performed  remotely  and  communicated  via  Internet.  This 
assessment is critical after an ICD shock to determine the arrhythmia 
diagnosis and exclude an unnecessary therapy. Device infection is an 
important problem long term and occurs in ~1% of patients. This risk 
may be less for subcutaneous implants.

ICDs decrease mortality in patients at risk for sudden death due to 
structural  heart  diseases.  In  all  cases,  ICDs  are  recommended  only  if 
there is also expectation for survival of at least a year with acceptable 
functional  capacity.  The  exception  is  in  cases  of  patients  with  end-
stage  heart  disease  who  are  awaiting  cardiac  transplantation  outside 
the  hospital  or  who  have  left  bundle  branch  block  QRS  prolongation 
such that they are likely to have improvement in ventricular function 
with  cardiac  resynchronization  therapy  from  a  biventricular  ICD 
(Fig. 252-6C). In these cases, an ICD may be warranted despite guarded 
prognosis. A wearable ICD system with electrodes incorporated into a 
vest and an external battery pack is also available for short-term use in 
patients pending decision regarding a permanent implanted system.

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular SystemDespite  prompt  termination  of  VT  or  VF  by  an  ICD,  the  occur-
rence  of  these  arrhythmias  predicts  subsequent  increased  mortality 
and  risk  of  heart  failure.  Occurrence  of  VT  or  VF  should  therefore 
prompt  assessment  for  potential  causes  including  worsening  heart 
failure, electrolyte abnormalities, and ischemia. Repeated shocks, even 
if appropriate, often induce posttraumatic stress disorder. Antiarrhyth-
mic drug therapy, most commonly amiodarone, or catheter ablation is 
often required for suppression of recurrent arrhythmias. Antiarrhyth-
mic  drug  therapy  can  alter  the  VT  rate  and  the  energy  required  for 
defibrillation, thereby necessitating programming changes in the ICD’s 
algorithms for detection and therapy.

 ■ CATHETER ABLATION FOR VT
Catheter  ablation  is  usually  performed  by  applying  radiofrequency 
(RF)  current  to  cause  thermal  injury  by  resistive  heating  of  cardiac 
tissue  responsible  for  the  arrhythmia.  An  electrode  catheter  with  an 
electroanatomic mapping system is used to map local electrical activity 
to identify the ventricular myocardium that is causing the arrhythmia, 
referred  to  as  the  arrhythmia  substrate.  The  size  and  location  of  the 
arrhythmia substrate determine the ease and likely effectiveness of the 
procedure, as well as the potential complications. When the arrhythmia 
originates  from  the  endocardium,  as  is  most  commonly  the  case,  it 
can be reached from an endovascular approach via a femoral vein or 
artery. Less commonly, arrhythmias originate from the subepicardium, 
and  percutaneous  pericardial  puncture,  similar  to  pericardiocentesis, 
is required to insert a catheter into the pericardial space for mapping 
and ablation. In patients with scar-related VT due to prior infarction or 
cardiomyopathy, ablation targets abnormal regions in the scar. Because 
these scars often contain multiple reentry circuits over relatively large 
regions,  extensive  areas  of  ablation  are  required,  and  these  areas  are 
often identified as regions of low voltage displayed on anatomic recon-
structions of the ventricle (Fig. 252-5).

Catheter  ablation  is  often  performed  in  patients  with  recurrent 
VAs associated with poor cardiac function, and the procedure-related 
mortality in this situation is 0.5–3%. Outcomes are better for patients 
with prior infarction and VT than for patients with nonischemic car-
diomyopathies in which the scar locations are more variable and often 
intramural or subepicardial. Ablation can be lifesaving for patients with 
very frequent or incessant VT. Methods of delivering ablative energy to 
intramural areas or areas requiring very extensive ablation are under 
development.  These  include  needle  catheters  capable  of  delivering 
ablative  energy  into  intramural  sources.  Stereotactic  body  radiation 
therapy (SBRT), classically used for treating thoracic tumors, has been 
used to direct radiation therapy to a specific portion of the scar sub-
strate to noninvasively ablate VT with encouraging early studies.

Idiopathic  VTs  and  PVCs  that  occur  in  the  absence  of  structural 
heart disease usually originate from a small focus, for which catheter 
ablation  typically  has  a  higher  success  rate  for  preventing  recurrent 
arrhythmia.  Long-term  arrhythmia-free  survival  in  these  patients  is 
excellent.

ARRHYTHMIA SURGERY
When antiarrhythmic drug therapy and catheter ablation fail or are not 
an  option,  surgical  cryoablation,  often  combined  with  aneurysmec-
tomy, can be effective therapy for recurrent VT due to prior myocardial 
infarction  and  has  also  been  used  successfully  in  a  few  patients  with 
nonischemic heart disease. Few centers now maintain the expertise for 
this therapy, though some use this therapy as an adjunct to ventricular 
assist device implantation.

253 Premature Ventricular 

Contractions, Nonsustained 
Ventricular Tachycardia, and 
Accelerated Idioventricular 
Rhythm
William H. Sauer, Usha B. Tedrow

Ventricular  ectopic  beats  are  very  common  and  may  be  identified 
during  outpatient  or  inpatient  telemetry  monitoring  either  due  to 
symptoms  of  palpitations  or  as  an  incidental  finding.  In  most  cases, 
ventricular  ectopy,  presenting  as  premature  ventricular  contractions 
(PVCs), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and accelerated 
idioventricular rhythm (AIVR), is asymptomatic and does not require 
specific  treatment.  While  most  commonly  benign  when  presenting 
in  patients  with  structurally  normal  hearts  and  normal  ECGs,  these 
ventricular arrhythmias can rarely be associated with structural heart 
disease and a risk of sudden death.

PREMATURE VENTRICULAR 
CONTRACTIONS AND NON-SUSTAINED VT
PVCs  are  very  common  and  can  be  due  to  enhanced  automaticity, 
triggered  automaticity,  or  reentry.  PVCs  are  often  sensitive  to  sym-
pathetic stimulation and can be a sign of increased sympathetic tone, 
myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, or underlying 
heart disease. During myocardial ischemia or in association with other 
structural heart disease, PVCs can be a harbinger of sustained ventric-
ular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).

The electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics of the arrhythmia are 
often  suggestive  of  whether  structural  heart  disease  is  present.  PVCs 
with smooth uninterrupted contours and sharp QRS deflections may 
suggest  an  ectopic  focus  in  relatively  normal  myocardium,  whereas 
broad  notching  and  slurred  QRS  deflections  may  suggest  a  diseased 
myocardial substrate. The QRS morphology also suggests the likely site 
of origin within the ventricle. PVCs that have a dominant S wave in V1, 
referred to as a left bundle branch block–like configuration, originate 
from the right ventricle or interventricular septum. Those with a dom-
inant R wave in V1 originate from the left ventricle. A superior frontal 
plane axis (negative in II, III, aVF) indicates initial depolarization of 
the inferior wall (diaphragmatic aspect of the heart), whereas an infe-
rior frontal plane axis (positive in II, III, aVF) indicates an origin in the 
cranial aspect of the heart. The location of arrhythmia origin often sug-
gests the nature of underlying heart disease. Most common ventricular 
arrhythmias that are not associated with structural heart disease have a 
left bundle branch block–like configuration. PVCs with a right bundle 
branch block configuration are more likely to be associated with struc-
tural heart disease. Multiple morphologies of PVCs (multifocal PVCs) 
are also more likely to indicate structural heart disease or a myopathic

1916 disease process. In patients with heart disease, greater frequency and 
complexity (couplets and NSVT) of these arrhythmias are associated 
with more severe disease.

PVCs AND NSVT DURING ACUTE ILLNESS
These  arrhythmias  are  often  encountered  in  patients  who  are  being 
evaluated in the emergency department or who have been hospitalized 
and are on a cardiac monitor. When encountered during acute illness 
or as a new finding, evaluation should focus on detection and correc-
tion of potential aggravating factors and causes, specifically myocardial 
ischemia, ventricular dysfunction, and electrolyte abnormalities, most 
commonly  hypokalemia.  If  there  is  a  suspicion  of  underlying  heart 
disease, then this should be evaluated. Otherwise, asymptomatic PVCs 
and NSVT in the hospitalized patient do not indicate any specific treat-
ment outside the patient’s presenting illness.

PVCs AND NSVT IN PATIENTS WITHOUT 
HEART DISEASE
Idiopathic  ventricular  arrhythmias  frequently  originate  from  the  left 
or right ventricular outflow tracts near the valve annuli, giving rise to 
PVCs or VT that have a left bundle branch block–like configuration, 
with an inferiorly directed frontal plane axis, as discussed below. Other 
regions that give rise to PVCs in normal hearts include the papillary 
muscles and fascicular tissue. NSVT from a benign idiopathic source 
is usually monomorphic, with rates <200 beats/min. NSVT that is very 
rapid, polymorphic, or with a first beat that occurs prior to the peak 
of  the  T  wave  (“short-coupled”)  is  uncommon  and  should  prompt 
concern and careful evaluation for underlying disease or genetic syn-
dromes associated with sudden death.

A  family  history  of  sudden  death  should  prompt  evaluation  for 
genetic  syndromes  associated  with  sudden  death,  including  cardio-
myopathy,  long  QT  syndrome,  and  arrhythmogenic  right  ventricular 
cardiomyopathy (ARVC) (see below). Any abnormality on the 12-lead 
ECG  warrants  further  evaluation.  Repolarization  abnormalities  are 
seen in a number of genetically determined syndromes associated with 
sudden  death,  including  the  long  QT  syndrome,  Brugada  syndrome, 
ARVC,  and  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  (Fig.  253-1).  Structural 
abnormalities such as mitral valve prolapse and mitral annular disjunc-
tion can be associated with papillary muscle PVCs and sudden death. 
An echocardiogram is often necessary to assess ventricular function, 

wall  motion  abnormalities,  and  valvular  heart  disease.  Contrast- 
enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also useful for 
this  purpose  and  for  the  detection  of  ventricular  scarring  that  is  the 
substrate for sustained VT. Exercise stress testing should be performed 
in patients with effort-related symptoms and for those at risk for cor-
onary artery disease.

TREATMENT OF IDIOPATHIC 
ARRHYTHMIAS
For  PVCs  and  NSVT  in  the  absence  of  structural  heart  disease  or  a 
genetic sudden death syndrome, no specific therapy is needed unless 
the  patient  has  significant  symptoms  or  evidence  that  frequent  PVCs 
are  depressing  ventricular  function  (see  below).  Reassurance  that  the 
arrhythmia  is  benign  is  often  sufficient  to  allow  the  patient  to  cope 
with the symptoms, which will often wax and wane in frequency over 
years.  Avoiding  stimulants,  such  as  caffeine  and  alcohol,  is  helpful  in 
some  patients.  If  symptoms  require  treatment,  β-adrenergic  blockers 
and  nondihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blockers  (verapamil  and 
diltiazem) are sometimes helpful. If these fail, more membrane active 
antiarrhythmic  drugs  and  catheter  ablation  are  options.  The  antiar-
rhythmic agents flecainide, propafenone, mexiletine, and amiodarone 
can be effective, but the potential for side effects warrants careful con-
sideration prior to prescribing these agents for long-term use. Catheter 
ablation is effective at suppressing this arrhythmia in ~90% of patients. 
Failure of ablation is usually due to inability to provoke the arrhythmia 
for mapping in the electrophysiology laboratory or if the site of origin 
is near a vital structure, such as the coronary arteries or His-Purkinje 
system,  or  is  not  accessible  due  to  a  site  of  origin  deep  within  the 
myocardium.
PVCs AND NSVT ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE 
CORONARY SYNDROMES
In the peri-infarct period, PVCs and NSVT are common and can be 
an early manifestation of ischemia and a harbinger of subsequent VF. 
Treatment with β-adrenergic blockers and correction of hypokalemia 
and hypomagnesemia reduce the risk of VF. Routine administration of 
antiarrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine or amiodarone does not reduce 
mortality  and  is  not  indicated  for  suppression  of  PVCs  or  asymp-
tomatic  NSVT  but  may  be  implemented  transiently  if  an  episode  of 
sustained VT or VF occurs, with the goal of reducing the likelihood of 
a subsequent episode.

Following  recovery  from  acute  myocardial 
infarction  (MI),  frequent  PVCs  (typically  >10 
PVCs/h),  repetitive  PVCs  with  couplets,  and 
NSVT  are  markers  for  depressed  ventricular 
function  and  increased  mortality,  but  routine 
antiarrhythmic  drug  therapy  to  suppress  these 
arrhythmias  has  not  been  shown  to  improve 
mortality.  Therefore,  amiodarone  is  an  option 
for  treatment  of  symptomatic  arrhythmias  in 
this population when the potential benefit out-
weighs  its  potential  toxicities.  β-Adrenergic 
blockers  reduce  sudden  death  but  have  limited 
effect on spontaneous arrhythmias.

For survivors of an acute MI, an implantable 
cardioverter  defibrillator  (ICD)  reduces  mor-
tality  in  certain  high-risk  groups:  patients  who 
have  survived  >40  days  after  the  acute  MI  and 
have a left ventricular ejection fraction of <30%, 
or who have an ejection fraction <35% and have 
symptomatic heart failure (functional class II or 
III);  and  patients  >5  days  after  MI  who  have  a 
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, NSVT, 
and  inducible  sustained  VT  or  VF  on  electro-
physiologic  testing.  ICDs  do  not  reduce  total 
mortality  when  routinely  implanted  early  after 
MI and have not been demonstrated to improve 
mortality  when  implanted  early  after  coronary 
artery revascularization.

showing normal sinus rhythm with ventricular bigeminy. The PVCs have a right bundle branch block configuration in V1 with superiorly directed axis. The leads V4–V6 are 
negative. The configuration is consistent with a PVC origin in the posteromedial papillary muscle of the left ventricle.

PVCs AND NSVT ASSOCIATED WITH 
DEPRESSED VENTRICULAR FUNCTION 
AND HEART FAILURE
PVCs and NSVT are common in patients with depressed ventricular 
function  and  heart  failure  and  are  markers  for  disease  severity  and 
increased mortality, but antiarrhythmic drug therapy to suppress these 
arrhythmias has not been shown to improve survival. The use of antiar-
rhythmic drugs whose major action is blockade of the cardiac sodium 
channel (flecainide, propafenone, mexiletine, quinidine, and disopyr-
amide) is avoided in patients with structural heart disease because of 
a  risk  of  proarrhythmia  and  negative  inotropic  effects.  Amiodarone 
suppresses ventricular ectopy and reduces sudden death but does not 
improve overall survival. ICDs are the major therapy to protect against 
sudden death in patients at high risk and are recommended for those 
with  a  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  <35%  and  New  York  Heart 
Association class II or III heart failure, in whom they reduce mortality 
from 36 to 29% over 5 years.

PVC AND NSVT ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER 
CARDIAC DISEASES
Ventricular  ectopy  is  associated  with  increased  mortality  in  patients 
with  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  or  with  congenital  heart  disease 
associated with right or left ventricular dysfunction. In these patients, 
management  is  similar  to  that  for  patients  with  ventricular  dysfunc-
tion. Pharmacologic suppression of the arrhythmia has not been shown 
to improve mortality. ICDs are indicated for patients considered at high 
risk for sudden cardiac death.

PVC-INDUCED VENTRICULAR 
DYSFUNCTION
Very  frequent  ventricular  ectopy  and  repetitive  NSVT  can  depress 
ventricular  function,  possibly  through  an  effect  similar  to  chronic 
tachycardia  or  by  inducing  ventricular  dyssynchrony.  Depression  of 
ventricular  function  rarely  occurs  unless  PVCs  account  for  at  least 
10–20%  of  total  beats  over  a  24-h  period,  and  only  a  minority  of 
patients  with  PVCs  will  have  a  reversible  cardiomyopathy.  Often  the 
PVCs are idiopathic and unifocal, most commonly originating from the 

outflow tract regions or left ventricular papillary muscles (Fig. 253-2), 
where they can be targeted for ablation.

Other sites of origin such as the mitral and tricuspid valve annuli, 
right  ventricular  moderator  band,  and  even  the  epicardial  surface 
of  the  heart  also  occur  (Fig.  253-3).  The  factors  that  can  potentially 
predict development of heart failure and increased risk of adverse out-
comes include PVC frequency, characteristics of the PVC morphology, 
and timing of the PVC coupling interval. In addition, the presence of 
late  gadolinium  enhancement  on  cardiac  MRI  may  suggest  the  pres-
ence of an additional underlying cardiomyopathic process. The degree 
of expected recovery of ventricular function with PVC suppression is 
difficult  to  predict.  Even  in  the  setting  of  known  underlying  cardio-
myopathy,  controlling  frequent  ventricular  ectopy  can  be  helpful  to 
improve ejection fraction and improve other factors such as delivery of 
resynchronization pacing.

ACCELERATED IDIOVENTRICULAR 
RHYTHMS
Three or more ventricular beats at a rate slower than 100 beats/min are 
termed an AIVR (Fig. 253-4). Automaticity is the likely mechanism, 
although in some rare cases, a reentrant circuit utilizing diseased myo-
cardium can cause AIVR. Idioventricular rhythms are common during 
acute  MI  and  may  emerge  during  sinus  bradycardia.  Often,  they  are 
not symptomatic, but hemodynamic compromise may occur with the 
loss of atrioventricular synchrony in susceptible patients. Atropine may 
be  administered  to  increase  the  sinus  rates  if  this  is  a  concern.  This 
rhythm  is  also  common  in  patients  with  cardiomyopathies  or  sleep 
apnea.  It  can  also  be  idiopathic,  often  emerging  when  the  sinus  rate 
slows  during  sleep.  Therapy  should  target  any  underlying  cause  and 
correction of bradycardia. Specific antiarrhythmic therapy for asymp-
tomatic idioventricular rhythm is not necessary.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Recently,  it  has  been  appreciated  that  inflammation  plays  a  role  in 
the genesis of PVCs in specific patients with inflammatory cardiomy-
opathies  and  even  in  inherited  cardiomyopathies.  The  roles  of  early 
identification of this process and targeted treatment are areas of active 
research.

254 Sustained Ventricular 
Tachycardia
William H. Sauer, Usha B. Tedrow

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a ventricular 
arrhythmia  with  a  wide  QRS  lasting  for  30  s  or  requiring  an  inter-
vention  for  termination.  Each  QRS  complex  resembles  the  others, 
indicating  either  a  site  of  origin  from  either  an  automatic  focus  or 
fixed reentry circuit. In structural heart disease, the substrate is most 
often an area of patchy replacement fibrosis due to infarction, fibrosis, 
inflammation, or prior cardiac surgery that creates anatomic or func-
tional  reentry  pathways.  Less  commonly,  VT  is  related  to  reentry  or 
automaticity in diseased conduction pathways in the Purkinje system. 
While  scar-related  reentrant  VTs  are  associated  with  risk  of  sudden 
death, idiopathic VT is a more benign form of VT that occurs in struc-
turally normal hearts and can be due to a focal region of automaticity in 
the myocardium or reentry involving a portion of the Purkinje system.
The  clinical  presentation  varies  depending  on  the  rate  of  the 
arrhythmia, underlying cardiac function, and autonomic adaptation in 
response to the arrhythmia. Rapid VT can produce hypotension that 
may present as syncope, particularly in patients with significant ven-
tricular dysfunction. In contrast, patients with normal cardiac function 
might tolerate their sustained VT, even presenting with simple palpita-
tions, despite rapid rates. Monomorphic VT that is rapid or associated 
with structural heart disease may eventually deteriorate to ventricular 
fibrillation (VF), which may be the initial cardiac rhythm recorded at 
the time of resuscitation of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

DIAGNOSIS
Sustained  monomorphic  VT  (Table  254-1)  has  to  be  distinguished 
from  other  causes  of  uniform  wide  QRS  tachycardia.  These  include 
supraventricular  tachycardia  with  left  or  right  bundle  branch  block 
aberrant  conduction,  supraventricular  tachycardias  conducted  to  the 
ventricles over an accessory pathway, and rapid cardiac pacing, appro-
priate  or  inappropriate,  in  a  patient  with  a  ventricular  pacemaker  or 
defibrillator. In the presence of known heart disease, VT is the most 
likely diagnosis of a wide QRS tachycardia, independent of QRS mor-
phology. When left ventricular (LV) function is depressed or there is 
evidence  of  structural  myocardial  disease,  scar-related  reentry  is  the 
most likely cause of sustained monomorphic VT. Scars are suggested 
by pathologic Q waves on the electrocardiogram (ECG), segmental LV 
or right ventricular wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram or

TABLE 254-1  Sustained Ventricular Arrhythmias
 1.  Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) without structural heart disease

A.  Outflow tract origin

•	 Right ventricular (RV) outflow tract: left bundle branch block pattern in 
V1 with inferior axis (tall QRS in inferior leads) and late transition in the 
precordial leads

•	 Left ventricular (LV) outflow tract: similar inferiorly directed axis but 
with early precordial transition with prominent R wave in V2–V3

B.  LV fascicular VT: Typical right bundle branch block pattern in V1 with sharp 
intrinsicoid deflection and left axis deviation (arising from left posterior 
fascicle in its most common form)

C.  Papillary muscle VT

•	 Posteromedial: atypical right bundle branch block pattern in V1 with 

monophasic R wave and left axis deviation

•	 Anterolateral: atypical right bundle branch block pattern in V1 with 
positive deflection in lead III and negative deflection in lead I

 2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy

•	 Monomorphic VT is common with prior large myocardial infarction
•	 Polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF) should prompt ischemia 

evaluation

 3.  Nonischemic cardiomyopathy

•	 Fibrotic scars can cause monomorphic VT, especially with sarcoidosis 

or other inflammatory cardiomyopathies, Chagas’ disease, and 
familial arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies such as Lamin A/C genetic 
cardiomyopathy

•	 Polymorphic VT and VF can also occur independently or related to 

degeneration of monomorphic VT
 4.  Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy

•	 Monomorphic VT usually of RV origin (left bundle branch morphology in V1)
•	 Polymorphic VT and VF can occur independently or related to 

degeneration of monomorphic VT

 5.  Repaired tetralogy of Fallot

•	 Monomorphic VT of RV origin (usually left bundle branch morphology in V1)

 6.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

•	 Polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation
•	 Less commonly, monomorphic VT associated with myocardial scars, 

particularly apical aneurysms
 7.  Genetic arrhythmia syndromes

A.  Long QT syndrome

•	 Torsades des pointes VT

B.  Brugada syndrome

•	 Ventricular fibrillation episodes, often nocturnal

C.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT

•	 Polymorphic VT or bidirectional VT

D.  Short QT and early repolarization syndromes

•	 Ventricular fibrillation

 8.  Idiopathic polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation

•	 Usually triggered by recurrent premature ventricular contractions; the 
most common site of origin is the left posterior fascicle (right bundle 
branch block/left anterior fascicular block pattern)

nuclear imaging, and areas of delayed gadolinium enhancement during 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Hemodynamic  stability  during  the  arrhythmia  does  not  help  dis-
tinguish between VT and other mechanisms of wide-complex tachy-
cardia. A number of ECG criteria have been evaluated to distinguish 
supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy from VT. The presence of 
ventriculoatrial (VA) dissociation is a reliable marker for VT, provided 
the atrial rate is slower than the ventricular rate. Sometimes, P waves 
can be difficult to define, and the VA relationship cannot be assessed 
in  a  patient  with  an  ongoing  atrial  arrhythmia  such  as  atrial  fibrilla-
tion. A P wave following each QRS does not exclude VT because 1:1 
conduction from ventricle to atrium can occur. A monophasic R wave 
or Rs complex in aVR or concordance from V1 to V6 of monophasic 
R  or  S  waves  is  also  relatively  specific  for  VT  (Fig.  254-1).  A  num-
ber  of  other  QRS  morphology  criteria  have  also  been  described,  but

all  have  limitations  and  are  not  very  reliable  in  patients  with  severe 
heart disease. In patients with known bundle branch block, the same 
QRS morphology during tachycardia as during sinus rhythm suggests 
supraventricular tachycardia rather than VT, but even this is not abso-
lutely reliable. Patients with reentry involving the bundle branches of 
the Purkinje system can have a VT morphology that resembles their 
native QRS in sinus rhythm. An electrophysiologic study is sometimes 
required  for  definitive  diagnosis.  Occasionally,  noise  and  movement 
artifacts on telemetry recordings can simulate VT. Prompt recognition 
can avoid unnecessary tests and interventions.

TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS
Initial  management  follows  Advanced  Cardiac  Life  Support  (ACLS) 
guidelines.  If  hypotension,  impaired  consciousness,  or  pulmonary 
edema  is  present,  QRS  synchronous  electrical  cardioversion  should 
be  performed,  ideally  after  sedation  if  the  patient  is  conscious.  For 

stable tachycardia, a trial of adenosine is reasonable as this may clarify 
a supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. Adenosine should not 
be  used  if  the  patient  has  a  heart  transplant  or  if  the  wide-complex 
rhythm  is  irregular  or  unstable.  Intravenous  amiodarone  is  the  drug 
of  choice  if  heart  disease  is  present.  Following  restoration  of  sinus 
rhythm,  hospitalization  and  evaluation  to  define  underlying  heart 
disease  are  required.  Assessment  of  cardiac  biomarkers  for  evidence 
of myocardial infarction (MI) is appropriate, but acute MI is rarely a 
cause of sustained monomorphic VT. Elevations in troponin or crea-
tine  kinase  (CK)-MB  are  more  likely  to  indicate  myocardial  damage 
that  is  secondary  to  hypotension  and  ischemia  from  fixed  coronary 
lesions during the VT. Subsequent management is determined by the 
underlying heart disease and frequency of VT. If VT recurs frequently 
or is incessant, administration of antiarrhythmic medications or cath-
eter  ablation  may  be  required  to  restore  stability.  More  commonly, 
sustained monomorphic VT occurs as a single episode but with a high 
risk  of  recurrence.  Implantable  cardioverter  defibrillators  (ICDs)  are 
warranted for secondary prevention of sudden death in patients who 
present  with  sustained  VT  associated  with  structural  heart  disease  
(Fig. 254-2).

SUSTAINED MONOMORPHIC VT IN 
SPECIFIC DISEASES
 ■ CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Patients who present with sustained monomorphic VT associated with 
coronary artery disease typically have a history of a remote prior large 
MI. Patients typically present years after the acute infarct with a remod-
eled ventricle and markedly depressed LV function. Even when there 
is  biomarker  evidence  of  acute  MI,  a  preexisting  scar  from  previous 
MI should be suspected as the cause of the VT. Infarct scars provide 
a durable substrate for sustained VT, and up to 70% of patients have 
a recurrence of the arrhythmia within 2 years. Scar-related reentry is 
not usually dependent on recurrent acute myocardial ischemia, so cor-
onary revascularization is unlikely to prevent recurrent VT, although 
it  may  be  appropriate  for  treatment  of  angina  or  other  indications. 
Depressed ventricular function, which is a risk factor for sudden death, 
is usually present. Implantation of an ICD is clearly indicated for sec-
ondary prevention provided that there is a reasonable expectation of 
survival  for  1  year  with  acceptable  functional  status.  Compared  with

antiarrhythmic drug therapy, ICDs reduce annual mortality from 12.3 
to 8.8% and lower arrhythmic deaths by 50% in patients with hemody-
namically significant sustained VT or a history of cardiac arrest. Anti-
arrhythmic drugs may have some utility for palliation of VT symptoms 
and prevention of ICD therapies, such as shocks and antitachycardia 
pacing; however, without an ICD, these drugs do not improve survival.
Following ICD implantation, patients with depressed ejection frac-
tion remain at risk for clinical heart failure, recurrent ischemic events, 
and recurrent VT, with a 5-year mortality that exceeds 30%. Attention 
to  guideline-directed  medical  therapy  for  patients  with  heart  failure 
and  coronary  artery  disease,  including  β-adrenergic  blocking  agents 
and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, is important.

ICD therapies, whether shocks or antitachycardia pacing, constitute 
an adverse event for the patient and are associated with increased rates 
of  heart  failure,  mortality,  and  psychological  stress.  For  this  reason, 
recurrent VT episodes in patients with an ICD warrant treatment with 
medications  or  catheter  ablation.  In  a  randomized  study  of  catheter 
ablation  versus  escalated  medical  therapy  (Ventricular  Tachycardia 
Ablation  versus  Escalation  of  Antiarrhythmic  Drugs  [VANISH]), 
patients  receiving  catheter  ablation  fared  better  than  those  receiving 
increasing  doses  of  antiarrhythmic  drugs,  in  particular,  amiodarone. 
Another  randomized  trial  (BERLIN  VT)  examined  a  preventative 
versus  deferred  ablation  strategy  in  patients  who  had  not  yet  failed 
an antiarrhythmic drug. This trial was stopped early for futility, with 
more procedural complications but fewer VT episodes in the catheter 
ablation group. For this reason, the most recent consensus statement 
most strongly recommends catheter ablation for patients with ischemic 
cardiomyopathy failing or intolerant of antiarrhythmic drugs but also 
allows for consideration of catheter ablation when long-term therapy 
with an antiarrhythmic drug (such as amiodarone, which has signifi-
cant long-term toxicities) is not desired.
 ■ NONISCHEMIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
Sustained monomorphic VT associated with nonischemic cardiomyo-
pathy is usually due to scar-related reentry. The etiology of scar is often 
unclear, but progressive replacement fibrosis is the likely cause. Patients 
with  nonischemic  cardiomyopathy  (NICM)  have  historically  been 
presumed  to  have  a  postviral  etiology,  although  increasingly,  genetic 
causes are found in many. Inflammatory etiologies (myocarditis, sar-
coidosis) are also increasingly appreciated. On cardiac MRI, scars are 
detectable as areas of delayed gadolinium enhancement and are more 
often intramural (Fig. 254-3) or subepicardial in location as compared 
with  patients  with  prior  MI.  Scars  that  cause  VT  are  often  located 
adjacent to a valve annulus and can occur in either ventricle. Any car-
diomyopathic process can cause scars and VT, but cardiac sarcoidosis, 
Chagas’ disease, and cardiomyopathy due to Lamin A/C mutations are 
particularly associated with monomorphic VT. An ICD is indicated for 
patients with a history of sustained VT, syncope, or New York Heart 
Association  class  II  or  III  heart  failure  symptoms,  with  additional 
drugs or catheter ablation for control of recurrent VT. In addition, for 
patients with malignant familial arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, an 
ICD may be considered earlier in the clinical course.

Overall,  there  are  fewer  studies  of  catheter  ablation  for  VT  in 
NICM. Reported success rates are lower than VT ablation in ischemic 
cardiomyopathy in most observational series. Additionally, inability to 
reproduce the clinical VT at ablation attempts and epicardial and intra-
mural  reentry  circuits  are  important  causes  of  failure  of  endocardial 
VT  ablation  in  NICM.  Imaging  with  MRI  or  computed  tomography 
(CT) scans with late contrast administration to define areas of fibrosis 
can be useful to guide ablation.

ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR 
CARDIOMYOPATHY
Arrhythmogenic  right  ventricular  cardiomyopathy  (ARVC)  is  a  rare 
genetic  disorder  most  commonly  due  to  mutations  in  genes  encod-
ing  for  cardiac  desmosomal  proteins;  however,  it  is  increasingly 
appreciated  that  other  cardiomyopathic  processes  may  produce  a 
similar  phenotype.  Approximately  50%  of  patients  have  a  familial 
transmission  with  autosomal  dominant  inheritance.  A  less  common, 

FIGURE 254-3  Cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI). Shown is an MRI of the 
heart with the right ventricle on the left and the left ventricle on the right. Between 
the  ventricles  (arrows)  is  a  stripe  of  late  gadolinium  enhancement,  indicating 
midmyocardial  fibrosis  in  the  interventricular  septum.  This  type  of  scar  pattern 
is  often  seen  in  patients  with  nonischemic  cardiomyopathies  and  ventricular 
tachycardia.

autosomal recessive form is classically associated with cardiocutaneous 
syndromes  that  include  Naxos  disease  and  Carvajal  syndrome.  The 
former  is  most  commonly  related  to  mutations  in  plakophilin-2  and 
plakoglobin, while the latter is most commonly due to a mutation in 
desmoplakin. Patients are typically diagnosed between the second and 
fifth  decades  with  palpitations,  syncope,  or  cardiac  arrest  owing  to 
sustained monomorphic VT, although polymorphic VT can also occur. 
Fibrosis and fibrofatty replacement most commonly involve the right 
ventricular  myocardium  and  provide  the  substrate  for  reentrant  VT 
that usually has a left bundle branch block–like configuration in ECG 
lead V1, consistent with the right ventricular origin, and can resemble 
idiopathic  VT.  The  sinus  rhythm  ECG  suggests  the  disease  in  >85% 
of patients, most often showing T-wave inversions in V1–V3. Delayed 
activation of the right ventricle may cause a widened QRS (>110 ms) 
in the right precordial leads (V1–V3) and a prolonged S-wave upstroke 
in  those  leads  and,  occasionally,  a  notched  deflection  at  the  end  of 
the QRS known as an epsilon wave. Cardiac imaging may show right 
ventricular enlargement or areas of abnormal motion or reveal areas of 
scar on contrast-enhanced MRI.

LV  involvement  can  occur  and  can  occasionally  precede  manifest 
right  ventricular  disease.  Clinical  heart  failure  is  rare  except  in  late 
stages, and survival to advanced age can be anticipated provided that 
VT can be controlled. An ICD is recommended. When VT is exercise 
induced,  it  may  respond  to  β-adrenergic  blockers  and  limiting  exer-
cise.  Sotalol,  flecainide,  and  amiodarone  have  been  used  to  reduce 
ventricular  arrhythmias.  Catheter  ablation  prevents  or  reduces  VT 
episodes in 70% of patients, but epicardial mapping and ablation are 
often required.

ADULT CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
Among all patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), sus-
tained  monomorphic  VT  is  quite  rare.  However,  the  most  common 
substrate for sustained VT is seen in those with repairs of a ventricular 
septal defect, in particular tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The prevalence of 
VT after TOF repair is estimated to be 3–14%, and risk of sudden car-
diac death may reach as high as 1% per year in adulthood by the fourth 
or fifth decade of life. The greatest risk for ventricular arrhythmias is 
posed  via  two  potential  mechanisms:  (1)  those  who  have  undergone 
repair  involving  a  ventriculotomy  and  (2)  those  with  long-standing

FIGURE 254-4  Idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). This is a 12-lead electrocardiogram showing the onset of idiopathic VT in a young patient without 
structural heart disease. The VT has a left bundle branch block configuration in V1 and an inferiorly directed axis consistent with an outflow tract origin. Note that the narrow 
(normal sinus) beats have a normal QRS configuration, consistent with the patient’s lack of structural heart disease.

hemodynamic overload causing ventricular dysfunction and/or hyper-
trophy independent of surgical incisions.

Monomorphic  VT  in  TOF  most  commonly  occurs  in  stereotyped 
circuits  due  to  reentry  around  areas  of  surgically  created  scar  in  the 
right ventricle. Factors associated with VT risk include age >5 years at 
the time of repair, high-grade ventricular ectopy, inducible VT on an 
electrophysiologic  study,  abnormal  right  ventricular  hemodynamics, 
and sinus rhythm QRS duration >180 ms. An ICD is usually warranted 
for patients who have a spontaneous episode of VT, but ICDs are also 
considered  for  patients  with  multiple  risk  factors.  Catheter  ablation 
or antiarrhythmic drug therapy is used to control recurrent episodes.

BUNDLE BRANCH REENTRY VT
Reentry through the Purkinje system occurs in ~5% of patients with 
monomorphic  VT  in  the  presence  of  structural  heart  disease.  The 
reentry  circuit  typically  revolves  retrograde  via  the  left  bundle  and 
anterograde down the right bundle, thereby producing VT that has a 
left bundle branch block configuration. The VT QRS morphology may 
closely resemble the QRS morphology in sinus rhythm. Catheter abla-
tion of the right bundle branch abolishes this VT. Bundle branch reen-
try  is  usually  associated  with  severe  underlying  heart  disease.  Other 
scar-related VTs are often present and often require additional therapy.

IDIOPATHIC MONOMORPHIC VT
Idiopathic  VT  in  patients  without  structural  heart  disease  usually 
presents with palpitations, lightheadedness, and, rarely, syncope. Epi-
sodes and can be provoked either by sympathetic stimulation or acute 
withdrawal  of  sympathetic  tone,  as  in  the  immediate  postexercise 
period. The QRS morphology of the arrhythmia suggests the diagnosis 
(see below). The sinus rhythm ECG is normal. Family history suggests 
no familial cardiomyopathy or sudden death. Cardiac imaging, includ-
ing  echocardiography  and  cardiac  MRI,  shows  normal  ventricular 
function  and  no  evidence  of  ventricular  scar.  Occasionally,  a  patient 
with structural heart disease is found to have concomitant idiopathic 
VT unrelated to the structural disease, in which case, the underlying 
disease should be treated as per the guidelines, separate from the VT. 
Repeated  bursts  of  nonsustained  VT,  which  may  occur  incessantly, 
are  known  as  repetitive  monomorphic  VT  and  can  cause  a  tachy-
cardia-induced  cardiomyopathy  with  depressed  ventricular  function 

that  recovers  after  suppression  of  the  arrhythmia.  Sudden  death  in 
isolated idiopathic VT is rare, and an ICD is not recommended.

Outflow  tract  VTs  originate  from  a  focus  near  the  pulmonic  or 
aortic  valve  annuli,  usually  with  features  consistent  with  triggered 
automaticity. The arrhythmia may present with sustained VT, nonsus-
tained VT, or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Most origi-
nate in the right ventricular outflow tract, which gives rise to VT that 
has a left bundle branch block configuration in V1 and an axis that is 
directed inferiorly, with tall R waves in II, III, and aVF. Idiopathic VT 
can also arise in the LV outflow tract or in sleeves of myocardium that 
extend along the aortic root. LV origin is suspected when lead V1 or V2 
has prominent R waves. Although this typical outflow tract QRS mor-
phology favors idiopathic VT, some cardiomyopathies, notably ARVC, 
can cause PVCs or VT from this region. Excluding these diseases is an 
initial focus of evaluation (Fig. 254-4).

LV  fascicular  VT,  sometimes  referred  to  as  Belhassen’s  VT  or  
verapamil-sensitive VT, is the second most common form of idiopathic 
VT  after  outflow  tract  VTs.  It  often  presents  with  sustained  VT  that 
has a right bundle branch block–like configuration and is negative in 
the inferior leads. It is often exercise induced and occurs more often in 
men than women. The mechanism was originally thought to be focal 
but has been demonstrated to be due to a small reentry circuit in or 
near the septal ramifications of the LV Purkinje system. There can be 
an LV false tendon associated with this rhythm.

Other  sites  of  origin  for  idiopathic  VT  exist,  including  papillary 
muscles,  mitral  and  tricuspid  valve  annuli,  and  the  moderator  band 
in  the  right  ventricle.  Even  focal  sites  from  the  epicardial  surface 
have  been  described.  The  presence  of  VT  from  these  more  unusual 
sites should prompt even more careful assessment for structural heart 
disease.

MANAGEMENT OF IDIOPATHIC VT
Treatment  is  required  for  symptoms  or  when  frequent  or  incessant 
arrhythmias depress ventricular function. Symptoms can be controlled 
with  medications  including  beta  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers, 
and sodium channel blockers such as flecainide. Although flecainide is 
not typically recommended in patients with structural heart disease, it 
has been used successfully to resolve tachycardia-induced cardiomyop-
athy in the setting of idiopathic PVCs and VT. Catheter ablation is also

The region of interest is determined by analysis of presenting arrhythmias, underlying structural heart disease, and proximity to adjacent structures such as coronary 
arteries, the phrenic nerve, and the gastrointestinal tract. Radiation is delivered to the chosen treatment volume in order to create conduction block in the culprit scar region.

indicated for control of symptoms, has an overall success rate of 80%, 
and is recommended for those with symptomatic VT in whom medi-
cations are ineffective or not preferred by the patient. Efficacy and risks 
of catheter ablation vary with the specific site of origin of the VT, being 
most favorable for arrhythmias originating in the right ventricular out-
flow tract. Failure of ablation is most often due to inability to initiate 
the arrhythmia for mapping in the electrophysiology laboratory.

LV  interfascicular  VT  can  be  terminated  by  intravenous  adminis-
tration of verapamil, although chronic therapy with oral verapamil is 
not always effective. Catheter ablation is recommended if β-adrenergic 
blockers or calcium channel blockers are ineffective or not desired.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Treatment of monomorphic VT, especially in the setting of structural 
heart disease, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Lim-
itations of current therapies include toxicities of antiarrhythmic drugs 
and inability to successfully perform catheter ablation of the substrate 
for arrhythmias. Advances in imaging and intracardiac mapping tech-
niques  are  likely  to  improve  success  rates  over  time.  In  addition,  the 
inability  of  ablative  energy  to  reach  deep  intramural  substrates  is  a 
current limitation. Innovations in delivery of ablative energy, includ-
ing  bipolar  ablation,  needle  catheter  ablation,  and  electroporation, 
are ongoing. In addition, noninvasive ablation is a promising area of 
investigation. Proton beam or stereotactic radiation can be used to tar-
get VTs identified by advanced cardiac imaging or by a multielectrode 
ECG vest. Early multicenter studies suggest durable control of VT with 
noninvasive ablation (Fig. 254-5).

POLYMORPHIC VENTRICULAR 
TACHYCARDIA
Sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) has a continuously 
changing QRS configuration from beat to beat, indicating a continually 
changing  ventricular  activation  sequence.  However,  unlike  sustained 
monomorphic  VT,  polymorphic  VT  does  not  necessarily  indicate  a 
fixed structural abnormality or focus of automaticity. Reentry can occur 
with  continually  changing  reentrant  paths,  spiral  wave  reentry,  and 
multiple automatic foci as potential mechanisms. This type of reentry

can occur near fibrotic areas of myocardium, potentiated by proximity 
to damaged Purkinje cells or ventricular hypertrophy. Abnormal trans-
mural dispersion of repolarization can occur in the setting of channe-
lopathies  or  antiarrhythmic  drugs  in  the  absence  of  structural  heart 
disease. Sustained polymorphic VT usually degenerates into ventricular 
fibrillation (VF). Polymorphic VT is typically seen in association with 
acute myocardial infarction or ischemia (MI), ventricular hypertrophy, 
and a number of genetic mutations that affect cardiac ion channels.

POLYMORPHIC VT ASSOCIATED WITH 
ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION/
ISCHEMIA
Acute  MI  or  ischemia  is  a  common  cause  of  polymorphic  VT  and 
should  be  the  initial  consideration  in  management.  Approximately 
10%  of  patients  with  acute  MI  develop  VT  that  degenerates  to  VF, 
likely  related  to  reentry  through  the  infarct  border  zone.  The  risk  is 
greatest in the first hour of acute MI. More rarely, surviving Purkinje 
cells  with  automaticity  can  initiate  polymorphic  VT.  Following  defi-
brillation as per the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines, 
management  is  as  for  acute  MI.  β-Adrenergic  blockers,  correction 
of  electrolyte  abnormalities,  and  prompt  myocardial  reperfusion  are 
required. Repeated episodes of polymorphic VT may suggest ongoing 
MI  and  warrant  assessment  of  adequacy  of  myocardial  reperfusion. 
Polymorphic VT and VF that occur within the first 48 h of acute MI 
are  associated  with  greater  in-hospital  mortality,  but  patients  who 
survive past hospital discharge are not at increased risk for arrhythmic 
sudden death. Long-term therapy for postinfarct ventricular arrhyth-
mia is determined by residual left ventricular (LV) function, with an 
implantable  cardioverter  defibrillator  (ICD)  indicated  for  persistent 
severe LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <35%).

REPOLARIZATION ABNORMALITIES AND 
GENETIC ARRHYTHMIA SYNDROMES
 ■ ACQUIRED LONG QT SYNDROME
Abnormal prolongation of the QT interval is associated with the poly-
morphic  VT  torsades  des  pointes.  The  VT  often  has  a  characteristic 

initiation sequence of a premature ventricular beat that induces a pause, 
followed by a sinus beat that has a longer QT interval and interruption 
of the T wave by the premature ventricular contraction (PVC) that is 
the  first  beat  of  the  polymorphic  VT  (Fig.  255-1).  This  characteris-
tic  initiation  is  termed  pause-dependent.  Causes  of  QT  prolongation 
include  electrolyte  abnormalities,  bradycardia,  and  a  number  of 
medications  that  block  repolarizing  potassium  currents,  notably  the 
antiarrhythmic drugs sotalol, dofetilide, and ibutilide, but also a num-
ber of other medications used for noncardiac diseases, including ery-
thromycin, pentamidine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, and methadone. 
Individual susceptibility may be related to genetic polymorphisms or 
mutations that influence repolarization. The website crediblemeds.org 
is an excellent resource for the clinician to determine whether a given 
medication has been reported to prolong the QT interval.

Patients  typically  present  with  near-syncope,  syncope,  or  cardiac 
arrest.  Sustained  episodes  degenerate  to  VF  requiring  defibrillation. 
PVCs  and  nonsustained  VT  often  precede  episodes  of  sustained  VT. 
Intravenous  administration  of  1–2  g  of  magnesium  sulphate  usually 
suppresses  recurrent  episodes.  If  magnesium  alone  is  ineffective, 
increasing  heart  rate  with  isoproterenol  infusion  or  pacing,  to  a  rate 
of 100–120 depolarizations/min as required to suppress PVCs, usually 
suppresses VT recurrences. These maneuvers allow time for correction 
of associated electrolyte disturbance (hypokalemia and hypocalcemia) 
and  bradycardia  and  removal  of  any  causative  drugs  (Table  255-1). 
Drug  interactions  that  elevate  levels  of  the  offending  agent  are  often 
a  precipitating  factor.  Patients  who  experience  a  polymorphic  VT 
induced by QT prolongation should be considered to have a suscepti-
bility to the arrhythmia and should avoid all future exposure to medi-
cations known to prolong the QT interval.
 ■ CONGENITAL LONG QT SYNDROME
The  congenital  long  QT  syndrome  (LQTS)  is  caused  by  mutations  in 
genes coding for cardiac ion channels responsible for ventricular repo-
larization.  The  corrected  QT  (QTc)  is  typically  prolonged  to  >440  ms  
in  men  and  460  ms  in  women.  Symptoms  are  due  to  torsades  des 
pointes VT. Several forms of congenital LQTS have been identified, but 
three groups of mutations that lead to LQTS-1, LQTS-2, and LQTS-3

particularly swimming. In LQTS-2, sudden auditory stimuli or emo-
tional upset predisposes to events. In LQTS-3, sudden death tends to 
occur during sleep. Asymptomatic patients may be discovered in the 
course of family screening or on a routine electrocardiogram (ECG). 
Genotyping can be helpful for family screening and to provide reassur-
ance regarding the diagnosis. Correlations of genotype with risk and 
response  to  therapy  are  beginning  to  emerge.  In  most  patients  with 
LQTS-1 or LQTS-2, adequate doses of beta-blocker therapy (the non-
selective agents nadolol and propranolol are favored) are sufficient pro-
tection  from  arrhythmia  episodes.  Markers  of  increased  risk  include 
QTc interval exceeding 500 ms, female gender, and a history of syncope 
or  cardiac  arrest.  Recurrent  syncope  despite  beta-blocker  therapy  or 
a high-risk profile merits consideration of an ICD. Avoidance of QT- 
prolonging drugs is critical for all patients with LQTS, including those 
who are genotype positive but have normal QT intervals.
 ■ SHORT QT SYNDROME
Short QT syndrome is very rare compared to LQTS. The QTc is <360 ms 
and usually <300 ms. The genetic abnormality causes a gain of function 
of the potassium channel (IKr) or reduced inward depolarizing currents. 
The abnormality is associated with atrial fibrillation, polymorphic VT, 
and sudden death.
 ■ BRUGADA SYNDROME
Brugada  syndrome  is  a  rare  syndrome  characterized  by  >0.2  mV  of 
ST-segment  elevation  with  a  coved  ST  segment  and  negative  T  wave 
in more than one anterior precordial lead (V1–V3) (see Fig. 253-1) and 
episodes  of  syncope  or  cardiac  arrest  due  to  polymorphic  VT  in  the 
absence  of  structural  heart  disease.  Cardiac  arrest  may  occur  during 
sleep  or  be  provoked  by  febrile  illness.  Males  are  more  commonly 
affected  than  females.  Mutations  involving  cardiac  sodium  channels 
are identified in ~25% of cases. Distinction from patients with similar 
ST elevation owing to LV hypertrophy, pericarditis, myocardial ische-
mia or MI hyperkalemia, hypothermia, right bundle branch block, and 
arrhythmogenic  right  ventricular  cardiomyopathy  is  often  difficult. 
Furthermore,  the  characteristic  ST-segment  elevation  can  wax  and 
wane over time and may become pronounced during acute illness and 
fever. Administration of the sodium channel–blocking drugs flecain-
ide, ajmaline, or procainamide can augment or unmask ST elevation in 
affected individuals. An ICD is indicated for individuals who have had 
unexplained syncope or been resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Quini-
dine and catheter ablation of abnormal regions in the epicardial right 
ventricular free wall have been used successfully to suppress frequent 
episodes of VT.
 ■ EARLY REPOLARIZATION SYNDROME
Patients resuscitated from VF who have no structural heart disease or 
other  identified  abnormality  have  a  higher  prevalence  of  J-point  ele-
vation with notching in the terminal QRS. A family history of sudden 
death is present in some patients, suggesting a potential genetic basis. 
J-point elevation is also seen in some patients with the Brugada syn-
drome and is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias. An ICD is 
recommended for those who have had prior cardiac arrest. It should be 
noted that J-point elevation is commonly seen as a normal variant in 
patients without arrhythmias, and in the absence of specific symptoms, 
the clinical relevance is not known.
 ■ CATECHOLAMINERGIC POLYMORPHIC VT
This rare familial syndrome is due to mutations in the cardiac ryano-
dine  receptor  and,  less  commonly,  the  sarcoplasmic  calcium  binding 
protein calsequestrin 2. These mutations result in abnormal sarcoplas-
mic  calcium  handling  and  polymorphic  ventricular  arrhythmias  that 
resemble  those  seen  with  digitalis  toxicity.  The  VT  is  polymorphic  or 
has  a  characteristic  alternating  QRS  morphology  termed  bidirectional 
VT. Patients usually present during childhood with exercise or emotion- 
induced palpitations, syncope, or cardiac arrest. β-Adrenergic blockers 
(e.g., nadolol and propranolol) and an ICD are usually recommended. 
Verapamil, flecainide, or surgical left cardiac sympathetic denervation 
reduces or prevents recurrent VT in some patients. The use of ICDs 
is controversial because of the fear that an ICD shock could initiate a

vicious  cycle  of  adrenergic  output  and  escalated  ventricular  arrhyth-
mias, leading to death.
 ■ HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY
Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  (HCM)  is  the  most  common  genetic 
cardiovascular  disorder,  occurring  in  1  in  500  individuals,  and  is  a 
prominent cause of sudden death before the age of 35 years. Sudden 
death can be due to polymorphic VT/VF. Rarely, sustained monomor-
phic  VT  occurs  related  to  areas  of  ventricular  scar,  most  commonly 
in patients who develop an apical aneurysm. Risk factors for sudden 
death  in  this  disease  include  young  age,  nonsustained  VT,  failure  of 
blood  pressure  to  increase  during  exercise,  recent  (within  6  months) 
syncope,  ventricular  wall  thickness  >3  cm,  and  possibly  the  severity 
of LV outflow obstruction. An ICD is generally indicated for high-risk 
subjects, but the specific risk profile warranting an ICD continues to be 
debated. Surgical myectomy, performed to relieve outflow obstruction, 
has  been  associated  with  a  sudden  death  rate  of  <1%  per  year.  The 
reported annual rate of sustained VT or sudden death after transcor-
onary ethanol septal ablation done to relieve outflow obstruction has 
been reported to range between 1 and 5%.
 ■ GENETIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHIES
Genetic  dilated  cardiomyopathies  account  for  30–40%  of  cases  of 
nonischemic  dilated  cardiomyopathies.  Some  are  associated  with 
muscular  dystrophy.  Autosomal  dominant,  recessive,  X-linked,  and 
mitochondrial inheritance patterns are recognized. Mutations in genes 
coding for structural proteins of the nuclear lamina (Lamin A/C) and 
the  SCN5A  gene  are  particularly  associated  with  conduction  system 
disease and ventricular arrhythmias. Patients can experience polymor-
phic VT and cardiac arrest or develop areas of scar causing sustained 
monomorphic VT. ICDs are recommended for those who have had a 
sustained VT, are at high risk due to significantly depressed ventricular 
function (LV ejection fraction <35% and associated with heart failure), 
or have a malignant family history of sudden death.
 ■ VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION
VF  is  characterized  by  disordered  electrical  ventricular  activation 
without identifiable QRS complexes (Fig. 255-2). Spiral wave reentry 

and multiple circulating reentry wavefronts are possible mechanisms. 
Sustained polymorphic or monomorphic VT that degenerates to VF is 
a  common  cause  of  out-of-hospital  cardiac  arrest.  Treatment  follows 
ACLS guidelines with defibrillation to restore sinus rhythm. If resus-
citation is successful, further evaluation is performed to identify and 
treat underlying heart disease and potential causes of the arrhythmia, 
including the possibility that monomorphic or polymorphic VT could 
have initiated VF. If a transient reversible cause such as acute MI is not 
identified, therapy to reduce the risk of sudden death with an ICD is 
often warranted.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The  role  for  catheter  ablation  in  polymorphic  VT  and  VF  is  rapidly 
evolving,  with  some  investigators  making  use  of  simultaneous  elec-
trical  recordings  from  basket  catheters  to  define  critical  sites  for  the 
arrhythmia  and  correlating  these  with  detailed  cardiac  imaging  to 
identify typical vulnerable sites for ablation.

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular System256 Electrical Storm and  
Incessant Ventricular 
Tachycardia
William H. Sauer, Usha B. Tedrow

ELECTRICAL STORM
Electrical  storm  or  ventricular  tachycardia  (VT)  storm  refers  to  the 
occurrence of three or more episodes of VT or ventricular fibrillation 
(VF) within 24 h requiring intervention for termination. This severe 
electrical  instability  is  associated  with  a  high  mortality  and  requires 
prompt  therapeutic  intervention.  Electrical  storms  occur  in  4%  of 
patients with a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibril-
lator (ICD) but in as many as 20% of patients with a history of known 
VT or resuscitated sudden death. Catheter ablation in electrical storms 
can be life-saving.

INCESSANT VT
VT is designated incessant when VT continues to recur shortly after 
electrical, pharmacologic, or spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm 
(Fig. 256-1). Typically, VT is monomorphic. Rarely, a slow incessant 
monomorphic VT will fail detection by an ICD because it falls outside 
of the programmed detection parameters. If the arrhythmia is hemo-
dynamically  stable  acutely,  patients  can  present  with  symptoms  of 
gradual cardiac decompensation. VT may become incessant due to the 
proarrhythmic effect of an antiarrhythmic drug such as amiodarone or 
a  sodium  channel  blocker  such  as  flecainide.  Hemodynamic  support 
may be required acutely until the precipitating factors can be corrected. 
Urgent catheter ablation is often warranted.

The  occurrence  of  an  arrhythmia,  therefore,  warrants  a  reevaluation 
for  possible  decline  in  cardiac  function,  emergence  of  ischemia,  or 
intercurrent illness.

If the ICD therapy is appropriate for VT or VF, consideration is given 
to whether therapy is warranted to reduce further episodes with either 
antiarrhythmic drug therapy or catheter ablation. Patients who have a 
rare episode of VT that is appropriately terminated and who have no 
other evidence of instability may not need any additional therapy, par-
ticularly if the VT is terminated by antitachycardia pacing rather than a 
shock. Shocks reduce quality of life and can lead to posttraumatic stress 
disorder. In many patients, the possibility of a shock can be reduced with 
appropriate ICD programming. Studies have shown that antitachycar-
dia pacing effectively terminates >70% of VT episodes, even when VT 
is very rapid. Most ICDs can be programmed to attempt overdrive pace 
termination during capacitor charge. If the arrhythmia then terminates, 
the shock is aborted. Appropriate programming of antitachycardia pac-
ing is therefore critical for reducing shocks. For patients implanted with 
ICDs as primary prevention, programming of VF detection zones >220 
beats/min significantly reduces unnecessary and inappropriate shocks. 
Long detection times will also help avoid unnecessary therapies for VT 
episodes liable to terminate spontaneously.

Recurrent symptomatic episodes of VT or VF (Fig. 256-2) warrant 
specific  therapy  with  antiarrhythmic  drugs  or  ablation  as  discussed 
for the specific arrhythmia. The beta blockers sotalol and amiodarone 
are the most common pharmacologic options. Amiodarone combined 
with beta blockers is more effective than sotalol or beta blockers alone. 
It  is  important  to  recognize  that  although  VT/VF  episodes  may  rep-
resent a deterioration of clinical status in these patients, interventions 
to control the arrhythmia itself may have adverse effects on outcome. 
Most  antiarrhythmic  drugs  have  the  potential  to  induce  bradycardia 
to the point of requiring pacing from the ICD that, in itself, may have 
deleterious  effects  on  ventricular  function.  Catheter  ablation  is  an 
important option for patients with monomorphic VT.

MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS PRESENTING 
WITH ICD SHOCKS
A substantial number of patients who receive an ICD can be expected 
to have an arrhythmia that is terminated by the ICD, either by a shock 
or  antitachycardia  pacing.  Although  this  is  an  expected  event,  it  can 
be  a  sign  of  impending  instability,  deterioration  of  cardiac  function, 
or emergence of a new arrhythmia and therefore requires evaluation. 
Interrogation  of  the  ICD  is  crucial  after  a  patient  reports  a  shock  or 
symptoms of arrhythmia to confirm that the therapy was indeed deliv-
ered for a ventricular arrhythmia and not for lead malfunction or an 
atrial arrhythmia. After a shock and in the absence of other symptoms 
to suggest arrhythmia or ischemia, patients have the option of waiting 
until  the  next  working  day  or  using  remote  monitoring  to  transmit 
device  interrogation  data  to  their  physician.  However,  occurrence  of 
multiple  ICD  shocks  constitutes  a  medical  emergency  and  warrants 
immediate  medical  attention  by  activating  the  emergency  medical 
system.  Patients  should  never  drive  to  the  hospital  themselves  after 
receiving a shock from their ICD.

Spontaneous  arrhythmias,  particularly  those  that  are  converted 
with a shock, are associated with a subsequent increased risk of death 
and  hospitalization  in  patients  with  depressed  ventricular  function. 

MANAGEMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH 
ELECTRICAL STORM
Patients should be adequately sedated to allay anxiety and provide pain 
relief.  Recurrent  VT/VF  is  treated  using  standard  Advanced  Cardiac 
Life Support guidelines; treatment includes the use of medications such 
as  beta  blockers,  amiodarone,  and  lidocaine  with  correction  of  any 
metabolic  abnormalities.  Recordings  from  electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
monitoring or an implanted ICD are important to assess whether VT 
is  monomorphic  or  polymorphic.  The  initiation  and  termination  of 
tachycardia in the stored ICD electrograms may also suggest possible 
precipitating  or  aggravating  factors.  Sedation  or  general  anesthesia 
should  be  considered  for  suppression  of  recurrent  hemodynamically 
unstable ventricular arrhythmia. Percutaneous stellate ganglion block 
and  upper  thoracic  epidural  anesthesia  may  reduce  cardiac  sympa-
thetic outflow and have been used to restore stability in some patients. 
Rarely, mechanical ventricular support with extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation, percutaneous left ventricular assist device, or intra-aortic 
balloon pump may be considered (Fig. 256-3).

In  addition  to  this  global  strategy  of  stabilizing  the  heart  rhythm, 
reducing  sympathetic  drive,  and  relieving  any  triggering  mecha-
nisms for the management of electrical storm, there are some specific

 ■ VT/VF IN THE SETTING OF MYOCARDIAL 
ISCHEMIA
Ischemia  should  be  considered  especially  if  polymorphic  VT  or  VF  is 
identified as the primary arrhythmia. If electrical storm is occurring in 
the  setting  of  an  acute  coronary  syndrome,  emergent  revascularization 
and  alleviation  of  anginal  symptoms  should  be  attempted.  Within  the 
infarcted myocardium, surviving Purkinje cells can exhibit triggered auto-
maticity and lead to recurrent episodes of polymorphic VT/VF requiring 
frequent cardioversions before and after revascularization. Catheter abla-
tion of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) that are observed to 
repeatedly initiate the arrhythmia can be effective (Fig. 256-5).

 ■ PVC-INITIATED 
POLYMORPHIC VT/VF
Similar  to  the  post–myocardial  infarction 
electrical  storm,  patients  without  myocar-
dial  infarction  or  ischemia  can  have  PVC- 
initiated  polymorphic  VT/VF  storm.  This 
idiopathic  form  of  VF  is  usually  caused  by 
triggering  PVCs  originating  from  fascicular 
tissue  or  papillary  muscles.  Often,  the  ven-
tricular ectopy is from scarred myocardial tis-
sue  detected  on  cardiac  magnetic  resonance 
imaging.  Catheter  ablation  is  indicated  for 
this condition when antiarrhythmic medica-
tion is ineffective.
 ■ ACQUIRED OR CONGENITAL 
LONG QT SYNDROME
If  QT  prolongation  causing  torsades  des 
pointes  (TdP)  is  possible,  intravenous  mag-
nesium should be administered for its imme-
diate  effect  on  repolarization.  In  addition, 
electrolyte  repletion,  especially  potassium, 
should  be  aggressively  pursued.  Increasing 
the  heart  rate  can  sometimes  normalize  the 
QT  interval,  and  thus,  pharmacologic  or 
pacing  support  should  be  considered.  Isoproterenol  can  be  used  to 
increase a patient’s sinus rate, but there is the possibility of increased 
ectopy  with  high  doses  of  isoproterenol  possibly  exacerbating  ven-
tricular arrhythmias. Although lidocaine can reduce the QT interval, 
other antiarrhythmic agents should be avoided because of their effect 
on repolarization.

VT/VF  episodes.  Nondihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blockers  and

 ■ INFLAMMATORY CARDIOMYOPATHY
If  the  patient  has  no  known  previous  cardiac  disease,  consideration 
should be given to an inflammatory myocarditis causing the frequent 
ventricular  arrhythmias.  Giant  cell  myocarditis,  cardiac  sarcoidosis, 
and  certain  viral  myocarditis  can  present  with  VT/VF  storm.  An 
endomyocardial  biopsy  should  be  considered  to  potentially  identify 
new-onset  inflammatory  cardiomyopathies  that  may  require  urgent 
anti-inflammatory therapy. Once the acute episode is controlled, strat-
egies to prevent recurrent VT or VF should be considered.

CLINICAL DEFINITIONS, EPIDEMIOLOGY, 
AND PHENOTYPES
 ■ DEFINITIONS
Heart  failure  (HF)  is  a  common  final  pathway  for  most  chronic  car-
diovascular  diseases  including  hypertension,  coronary  artery  disease, 
and  valvular  heart  disease.  The  American  College  of  Cardiology  
Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) and Heart Failure 
Society of America (HFSA) guidelines define HF as a complex clinical 
syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of 
ventricular filling or ejection of blood leading to cardinal manifesta-
tions of dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention. The European Society 
of Cardiology’s (ESC) definition emphasizes typical symptoms (e.g., 
breathlessness,  ankle  swelling,  and  fatigue)  and  signs  (e.g.,  elevated 
jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral edema) 
caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, result-
ing in a reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures 
at rest or during stress. Because some patients present without signs 
or symptoms of volume overload, the term heart failure is preferred 
over the older term congestive heart failure. Cardiomyopathy and left 
ventricular  dysfunction  are  more  general  terms  that  describe  disor-
ders  of  myocardial  structure  and/or  function,  which  may  lead  to 
HF. In pathophysiologic terms, HF has been defined as a syndrome

characterized by elevated cardiac filling pressure and/or inadequate 
peripheral oxygen delivery, at rest or during stress, caused by cardiac 
dysfunction.

Chronic  heart  failure  describes  patients  with  longstanding  (e.g., 
months to years) symptoms and/or signs of HF typically treated with 
medical  and  device  therapy  as  described  in  Chap.  258.  Acute  heart 
failure, previously termed acute decompensated HF, refers to the rapid 
onset  or  worsening  of  symptoms  of  HF.  Most  episodes  of  acute  HF 
result from worsening of chronic HF, but ~20% are due to new-onset 
HF that can occur in the setting of acute coronary syndrome, acute val-
vular dysfunction, hypertensive urgency, or postcardiotomy syndrome. 
Similarly, acute pulmonary edema in HF describes a clinical scenario in 
which a patient presents with rapidly worsening signs and symptoms 
of pulmonary congestion, typically due to severe elevation of left heart 
filling pressure.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Global Incidence and Prevalence  HF is a major cause of mor-
bidity  and  mortality  worldwide.  An  estimated  6.2  million  American 
adults  are  being  treated  for  HF,  with  >600,000  new  cases  diagnosed 
each year. Globally, >26 million people are affected by HF. The preva-
lence  of  HF  increases  significantly  with 
age, occurring in 1–2% of the population 
aged 40–59 years and up to 12% of adults 
>80 years old (Fig. 257-1). The lifetime 
risk of HF at age 55 years is 33% for men 
and  28%  for  women.  Projections  show 
that the prevalence of HF in the United 
States will increase by 46% from 2012 to 
2030. Between 1980 and 2000, the num-
ber  of  HF  hospitalizations  rose  steadily 
in  both  men  and  women  to  ~1  million 
per year. However, according to the most 
recent  AHA  statistics,  hospitalizations 
decreased  from  1,020,000  in  2006  to 
809,000  in  2016.  While  prevalence  of 
HF  continues  to  rise,  incidence  may  be 
decreasing due to improved recognition 
and  treatment  of  cardiovascular  disease 
and  its  comorbidities  as  well  as  disease 
prevention. However, as rates of obesity 
rise  globally,  these  favorable  trends  in 
HF incidence may reverse.

studies, blacks have the highest risk of developing HF, followed by His-
panic, white, and Chinese Americans.  These  differences  are  attributed 
to  disparities  in  risk  factors  (e.g.,  obesity,  hypertension,  diabetes), 
socioeconomic status, and access to health care. Similarly, studies have 
shown  that  age-adjusted  rates  of  HF  hospitalization  are  highest  for 
black men, followed by black women, white men, and white women. 
Accurate data on HF prevalence from emerging nations are lacking. As 
developing nations undergo socioeconomic development, the epidemi-
ology of HF is becoming similar to that of Western Europe and North 
America, with coronary artery disease emerging as the most common 
cause of HF.

Morbidity and Mortality 
In primary care, the overall 5-year sur-
vival following the diagnosis of HF is ~50%. For patients with severe 
HF, the 1-year mortality may be as high as 40%. In the United States, 
1  in  8  deaths  list  HF  on  the  death  certificate.  The  majority  of  these 
patients  die  of  cardiovascular  causes,  most  commonly  progressive 
HF  or  sudden  cardiac  death.  A  number  of  clinical  and  laboratory 
parameters  are independent predictors of mortality (Table 257-1). In a 
population-based  study,  hospitalizations  were  common  after  an  HF 
diagnosis, with 83% hospitalized at least once, and 67%, 54%, and 43% 
hospitalized at least two, three, and four times, respectively. Following 
an  HF  admission,  mortality  rates  range  from  8–14%  at  30  days  to 
26–37% at 1 year to up to 75% at 5 years. Readmission with HF is also 
common, ranging from 20–25% at 60 days to nearly 50% at 6 months. 
With  each  subsequent  admission,  the  risk  of  death  rises.  There  are 
racial disparities in outcomes with blacks having higher case–fatality 
rates compared to whites. Despite these statistics, the overall prognosis 
for patients with HF is improving due to treatment of risk factors and 
increased use of guideline-directed therapies.

Costs  The  overall  cost  of  HF  care  is  high  (estimated  $30.7  billion 
in the United States in 2012) and rising. Projections for 2030 are that 
hospitalization  costs  for  HF  in  the  United  States  will  increase  to  $70 
billion. Indirect costs due to lost work and productivity may equal or 
exceed this amount. The global economic burden of HF in 2012 was 
estimated  at  $108  billion,  with  direct  costs  accounting  for  60%.  For 
pediatric patients with acute HF, inpatient costs are estimated at nearly 
$1 billion annually and rising.

≤40%) while the other half have near-normal or preserved EF (≥50%). 
Because most patients with HF (regardless of EF) have abnormalities 
in both systolic and diastolic function, the older terms of systolic heart 
failure  and  diastolic  heart  failure  have  fallen  out  of  favor.  Classifying 
patients based on their EF (HF with reduced EF [HFrEF] vs HF with 
preserved EF [HFpEF]) is important due to differences in demograph-
ics, comorbidities, and response to therapies (Chap. 258). Underlying 
causes  of  HF  may  be  associated  with  reduced  or  preserved  EF  and 
include disorders of the coronary arteries, myocardium, pericardium, 
heart valves and great vessels (Table 257-2). The diagnosis of HFpEF 
is often more challenging due to the need to rule out noncardiac causes 
of shortness of breath and/or fluid retention.

HF  with  Recovered  EF  A  subgroup  of  patients  who  are  diag-
nosed  with  HFrEF  and  treated  with  guideline-directed  therapy  have 
rapid  or  gradual  improvement  in  EF  to  the  normal  range  and  are 
referred to as having HF with recovered EF (HFrecEF). Predictors of 
HFrecEF  include  younger  age,  shorter  duration  of  HF,  nonischemic 
etiology, smaller ventricular volumes, and absence of myocardial fibro-
sis.  Specific  clinical  examples  include  fulminant  myocarditis,  stress 
cardiomyopathy,  peripartum  cardiomyopathy,  and  tachycardia-in-
duced  cardiomyopathy,  as  well  as  reversible  toxin  exposures  such  as 
chemotherapy,  immunotherapy,  or  alcohol.  Despite  recovery  of  EF, 
patients  may  remain  symptomatic  due  to  persistent  abnormalities  in 
diastolic  function  or  exercise-induced  pulmonary  hypertension.  For 
patients who become asymptomatic, withdrawal of therapy can lead to 
recurrence of HF symptoms and decrease in EF. In general, prognosis 
of  patients  with  HFrecEF  is  superior  to  that  of  patients  with  either 
HFrEF or HFpEF.

Heart  Failure  with  Mildly  Reduced  EF  (HFmrEF)  Patients 
with  HF  and  an  EF  between  40  and  50%  represent  an  intermediate 
group that are often treated for risk factors and comorbidities and with 
guideline-directed medical therapy similar to patients with HFrEF. They 
are  felt  to  have  primarily  mild  systolic  dysfunction,  but  with  features 
of  diastolic  dysfunction.  They  may  also  include  either  patients  with 
reduced  EF  who  experience  improvement  in  their  EF  or  those  with 
initially preserved EF who suffer a mild decline in their systolic perfor-
mance. Unlike the ACCF/AHA and HFSA guidelines, the ESC guideline 
has identified HFmrEF as a separate group in order to stimulate research 
into underlying characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment.

Acquired Versus Familial, Congenital, and Other Disorders 
In 
developed countries, coronary artery disease is responsible for approx-
imately two-thirds of the cases of HF, with hypertension as a principal 
contributor in up to 75% and diabetes mellitus in 10–40% (Fig. 257-3). 
While most cardiovascular disease underlying HF is acquired in mid 
and later life (Chaps. 261, 273, and 277), a wide range of congenital 
and inherited disorders leading to HF may be diagnosed in children 
and  younger  adults.  It  is  currently  estimated  that  >1.4  million  U.S. 
adults are living with congenital heart disease (CHD), which surpasses 
the number of children with CHD. In general, adults with CHD who 
develop HF can be divided into one of three pathophysiologic groups: 
uncorrected  defects  with  late  presentation  due  to  missed  diagnosis, 
nonintervention, or lack of access to care; repaired or palliated defects 
with late valvular and/or ventricular failure; or failing single-ventricle 
physiology.  In  addition,  each  adult  with  CHD  often  presents  with 
unique  anatomic  and  physiologic  challenges  that  affect  HF  and  its 
treatment.

FIGURE  257-3  Population  attributable  risk  of  heart  failure  (HF)  incidence.  Based  on  longitudinal  data  from  the 
Framingham Heart Study, the risk factors contributing most significantly to the population attributable risk (PAR) of HF 
in men were previous myocardial infarction and hypertension (in men, both represented equal contributions to HF PAR). 
In contrast, hypertension was the risk factor accounting for the majority of total PAR in women. In women, previous 
myocardial infarction accounted for only 13% of the PAR of HF compared with 34% in men. PAR values are developed 
based on individual calculations for each variable using hazard ratio and prevalence statistics. Thus, they may not, in 
aggregate equal 100%. LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy. (From MM Givertz, WS Colucci: Heart failure. In Peter Libby,

calcium-handling  and  cytoskeletal  func-
tion,  and  at  the  molecular  level  by  re-
expression of fetal genes (Table 257-3). In 
addition  to  cell  loss  from  necrosis,  myo-
cytes  that  are  unable  to  adapt  to  remod-
eling stimuli may be triggered to undergo 
apoptosis or programmed cell death. Fur-
ther  impairment  in  pump  function  and 
increased wall stress in the face of systemic 
vasoconstriction  and  loss  of  neurohor-
monal  adaptation  (discussed  below)  can 
lead  to  afterload  mismatch.  These  events 
feed  back  on  remodeling  stimuli,  setting 
up a cycle of deleterious processes resulting 
in clinical HF.

Inherited  cardiomyopathies  are  also  increasingly  recognized  in 
adults  presenting  with  HF.  These  include  more  common  disorders, 
such  as  hypertrophic  and  arrhythmogenic  cardiomyopathies,  and 
lesser  known  heart  muscle  disease  related  to  pathogenic  variants  in 
genes encoding lamin and titin, muscular dystrophies, and mitochon-
drial disease. Most forms of familial cardiomyopathy are inherited in 
an  autosomal  dominant  fashion.  Society  guidelines  have  been  pub-
lished documenting the importance of taking a detailed family history 
and indications for (and limitations of) clinical genetic testing.

A myriad of systemic diseases with cardiac and extracardiac mani-
festations  (e.g.,  amyloidosis,  sarcoidosis),  autoimmune  disorders  (e.g., 
systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), infectious diseases 
(e.g., Chagas, HIV), and drug toxicities (chemotherapy, other prescribed 
or illicit agents) can result in HF with either reduced or preserved EF. In 
Africa and Asia, rheumatic heart disease remains a major cause of HF, 
especially in the young. Finally, disorders associated with a high cardiac 
output state (e.g., anemia, thyrotoxicosis) are seldom associated with HF 
in the absence of underling structural heart disease. However, diagnosis 
and  treatment  of  high-output  HF  will  be  missed  if  not  considered  in 
the differential diagnosis of patients with predisposing conditions (e.g., 
cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease with arteriovenous fistula, Paget’s dis-
ease, or nutritional deficiency such as beriberi).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 ■ PROGRESSIVE DISEASE
HFrEF  is  a  progressive  disease  that  typically  involves  an  index  event 
followed by months to years of structural and functional cardiovascular 
remodeling (Fig. 257-4). The primary event may be sudden in onset, 
such as an acute myocardial infarction; more gradual, as occurs in the 
setting of chronic pressure or volume overload; inherited, as seen with 
genetic  cardiomyopathies;  or  congenital  disease.  Despite  an  initial 
reduction  in  cardiac  performance,  patients  may  be  asymptomatic  or 
mildly  symptomatic  for  prolonged  periods  due  to  the  activation  of 
compensatory mechanisms (described below) that ultimately contrib-
ute to disease progression.

Ventricular  Remodeling  As  demonstrated  in  both  animal  and 
human  studies,  different  patterns  of  ventricular  remodeling  occur 
in  response  to  excess  cardiac  workload.  Concentric  hypertrophy, 
in  which  increased  mass  is  out  of  proportion  to  chamber  volume, 
effectively  reduces  wall  stress  under  conditions  of  pressure  overload 
(e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis). By contrast, an increase in cavity 
size  or  volume  (eccentric  hypertrophy)  occurs  in  volume  overload 
conditions  (e.g.,  aortic  regurgitation,  mitral  regurgitation).  In  both 
forms  of  remodeling,  an  increase  in  ventricular  mass  is  accompa-
nied  at  the  cellular  level  by  myocyte  hypertrophy  and  interstitial 

While our understanding of ventricular 
remodeling  in  HFrEF  is  well  supported 
by animal and human studies, the mecha-
nisms underlying HFpEF are less clear. The 
original descriptions of HFpEF focused on 
diastolic dysfunction as the primary medi-
ator of HF signs and symptoms as exempli-
fied in older women with hypertension. At the myocyte level, impaired 
uptake of cytosolic calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by reduc-
tions in adenosine triphosphate explained abnormalities in myocardial 
relaxation.  As  different  phenotypes  of  HFpEF  have  emerged,  many 
pathophysiologic processes other than diastolic dysfunction have been 
implicated  in  disease  progression,  including  vascular  stiffness,  renal 
dysfunction,  sodium  avidity,  and  metabolic  inflammation  related  to 
regional adiposity. Furthermore, biologic alterations including oxida-
tive  stress  and  impaired  nitric  oxide  signaling  leading  to  nitrosative 
stress may play a role in disease activity and inform future therapies.
 ■ MECHANISMS OF DISEASE PROGRESSION

FIGURE  257-4  Remodeling  stimuli  in  heart  failure.  Chronic  hemodynamic  stimuli 
such  as  pressure  and  volume  overload  lead  to  ventricular  remodeling  through 
increases  in  myocardial  wall  stress,  inflammatory  cytokines,  signaling  peptides, 
neuroendocrine  signals,  and  oxidative  stress.  The  myocardium  responds  with 
adaptive  as  well  as  maladaptive  changes.  Reexpression  of  fetal  contractile 
proteins and calcium handling proteins may contribute to impaired contraction and 
relaxation. Myocytes unable to adapt might be triggered to undergo programmed 
cell  death  (apoptosis).  The  net  result  of  these  changes  is  further  impairment  in 
pump function and increased wall stress, thus completing a vicious cycle that leads 
to further progression of myocardial dysfunction. (From MM Givertz, WS Colucci:

understanding  of  these  mechanisms  derives  from  preclinical  studies,

benefit of therapies targeted to attenuating or reversing these biologic 
processes.

Neurohormonal  Activation  Activation  of  the  sympathetic  ner-
vous  system  (SNS)  and  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system  (RAAS) 
plays  a  critical  role  in  the  development  and  progression  of  HF.  Ini-
tially, neurohormonal activation leads to increases in heart rate, blood 
pressure,  and  cardiac  contractility  and  retention  of  sodium  and  water 
to  augment  preload  and  maintain  cardiac  output  at  rest  and  during 
exercise.  Over  time,  these  unchecked  compensatory  responses  lead 
to  excessive  vasoconstriction  and  volume 
retention, electrolyte and renal abnormalities, 
baroreceptor  dysfunction,  direct  myocardial 
toxicity, and cardiac arrhythmias. At the tissue 
level,  neurohormonal  activation  contributes 
to  remodeling  of  the  heart,  blood  vessels 
(atherosclerosis),  kidneys,  and  other  organs  
(Fig.  257-5)  and  the  development  of  symp-
tomatic  HF.  Landmark  clinical  trials  in  HF 
have  demonstrated  that  antagonism  of  the 
RAAS and SNS with renin-angiotensin system 
inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antago-
nists, and beta blockers attenuates or reverses 
ventricular  and  vascular  remodeling  and 
reduces morbidity and mortality (Chap. 258).

peptidase,  which  explains  in  part  the  beneficial  clinical  impact  of 
angiotensin  receptor–neprilysin  inhibition  in  HF  (Chap.  258).  As 
described below, natriuretic peptide levels can be used to assist in the 
diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with HF.

Endothelin,  Inflammatory  Cytokines,  and  Oxidative  Stress  
Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide with growth-promoting 
effects  that  may  play  an  important  role  in  pulmonary  hypertension 
and right ventricular failure. Endothelin is released from a variety of 
vascular  and  inflammatory  cells  within  the  pulmonary  circulation 
and  myocardium  in  response  to  increased  pressure  and  has  direct 
deleterious effects on the heart, leading to myocyte hypertrophy and 
interstitial fibrosis. Unlike RAAS and SNS inhibition, however, endo-
thelin blockade has not been shown to slow the progression of clinical 
HF but is beneficial for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(Chap. 283). Other factors that have the potential to cause or contrib-
ute  to  ventricular  remodeling  in  HF  include  inflammatory  cytokines 
such  as  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  α  and  interleukin  (IL)  1β  and 
reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. Potential sources of these 
biologically active substances are the liver and gastrointestinal tract, as 
described below. The role of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant thera-
pies remains unproven.

Novel Biologic Targets  Sodium-glucose  cotransporter-2  (SGLT-2) 
is  a  protein  located  on  the  proximal  tubule  of  the  kidney  that  is 
responsible  for  reabsorption  of  up  to  90%  of  filtered  glucose.  In 
patients with HF, activity of SGLT-2 contributes to sodium and water 
retention, endothelial dysfunction, abnormal myocardial metabolism, 
and impaired calcium handling. Inhibitors of SGLT-2 were developed 
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus to take advantage of their 
glycosuric and metabolic effects (Chap. 404). Subsequent large clinical 
trials  in  cardiovascular  disease  including  HF  (with  or  without  overt 
diabetes  mellitus)  have  demonstrated  not  only  safety  of  these  agents

Vasodilatory  Hormones  While  RAAS 
and  SNS  activation  contributes  to  disease 
progression in HF, a number of counterregu-
latory  hormones  are  upregulated  and  exert 
beneficial  effects  on  the  heart,  kidney,  and 
vasculature.  These  include  the  natriuretic 
peptides  (atrial  natriuretic  peptide  [ANP] 
and  B-type  natriuretic  peptide  [BNP]), 
prostaglandins  (prostaglandin  E1  [PGE1] 
and  prostacyclin  [PGI2]),  bradykinin,  adre-
nomedullin, and nitric oxide. ANP and BNP 
are  stored  and  released  primarily  from  the 
atria and ventricles, respectively, in response 
to  increased  stretch  or  pressure.  Beneficial 
actions are mediated through stimulation of 
guanylate  cyclase  and  include  systemic  and 
pulmonary  vasodilation,  increased  sodium 
and water excretion, inhibition of renin and 
aldosterone,  and  baroreceptor  modulation.

aortic arch, which in turn causes reduced parasympathetic tone. This decrease in afferent inhibition results in 
a  generalized  increase  in  efferent  sympathetic  tone  and  nonosmotic  release  of  arginine  vasopressin  from  the 
pituitary. Vasopressin is a powerful vasoconstrictor that also leads to reabsorption of free water by the kidney. 
Afferent signals to the central nervous system also activate sympathetic innervation of the heart, kidney, peripheral 
vasculature,  and  skeletal  muscles.  Sympathetic  stimulation  of  the  kidney  leads  to  the  release  of  renin,  with  a 
resultant increase in circulating levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone. The activation of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone  system  promotes  salt  and  water  retention,  peripheral  vasoconstriction,  myocyte  hypertrophy,  cell 
death, and myocardial fibrosis. Although these neurohormonal mechanisms facilitate short-term adaptation by 
maintaining blood pressure, they also result in end-organ changes in the heart and circulation. (Modified from

(as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) but also, more 
importantly,  beneficial  effects  on  morbidity  and  mortality.  Whether 
benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in HF are due primarily to diuretic effects 
or to effects on cardiac and vascular remodeling, proarrhythmia, renal 
function,  and/or  metabolic  function  or  inflammation  remains  to  be 
determined. Another pathway that is downregulated in HF and con-
tributes  to  endothelial  dysfunction  involves  cyclic  guanosine  mono-
phosphate (cGMP). Oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators enhance 
the cGMP pathway and exert beneficial myocardial and vascular effects 
in experimental and clinical HF.

Dyssynchrony and Electrical Instability 
In up to one-third of 
patients with HF, disease progression is associated with prolongation 
of the QRS interval. Electrical dyssynchrony in the form of left bundle 
branch  block  (LBBB)  or  intraventricular  conduction  delay  results  in 
abnormal  ventricular  contraction.  As  discussed  in  Chap.  258,  cor-
rection  of  electrical  dyssynchrony  with  left  or  biventricular  pacing 
can  improve  contractile  function,  decrease  mitral  regurgitation,  and 
reverse  ventricular  remodeling.  In  patients  with  symptomatic  HFrEF 
and  LBBB  on  guideline-directed  medical  therapy,  cardiac  resyn-
chronization  therapy  is  indicated  to  reduce  morbidity  and  mortality. 
Other  forms  of  electrical  instability,  including  atrial  fibrillation  with 
inadequate rate control and frequent premature ventricular complexes, 
can also contribute to worsening HF. In addition to the direct impact 
of  tachycardia  and  irregular  rhythm  on  disease  progression,  the  link 
between  these  arrhythmias  and  cardiac  remodeling  (atrial  and  ven-
tricular) involves increased wall stress, neurohormonal activation, and 
inflammation.

Secondary  Mitral  Regurgitation  A  large  number  of  patients 
with HFrEF demonstrate evidence of mitral regurgitation. This occurs 
due to a distortion in the mitral valve apparatus and includes the effects 
of various pathophysiologic mechanisms including reduced contractile 
force,  which  leads  to  decreased  coaptation  of  the  leaflets,  a  spheri-
cal  shape  of  the  ventricle  that  influences  length  and  function  of  the 
chordal-papillary muscle structure, increased dimension of the mitral 
annulus (and inability of the annulus to contract during systole) with 
reduced leaflet alignment, and dilation of the posterior wall of the left 
atrium, which distorts the posterior leaflet of the valve. This worsening 
in regurgitant volume contributes to progression in HF and adversely 
influences  prognosis.  Ensuring  that  this  vicious  cycle  is  interrupted 
is  now  a  therapeutic  target  in  HF.  Some  success  has  been  noted  by 
treating the mitral valve using transcatheter techniques when patients 
are carefully selected after exposure to optimal medical therapy when 
residual and significant secondary mitral regurgitation persists.
 ■ CARDIORENAL AND ABDOMINAL INTERACTIONS
An  important  concept  underlying  the  pathophysiology  of  HF  recog-
nizes  the  systemic  nature  of  disease.  Thus,  while  the  primary  hemo-
dynamic  problem  in  HF  is  related  to  abnormalities  in  myocardial 
function (preload, afterload, and contractility), many of the presenting 
signs  and  symptoms  are  related  to  end-organ  failure,  including  dys-
function of the kidneys, liver, and lungs. The heart and kidney inter-
action  increases  circulating  volume,  worsens  symptoms  of  HF,  and 
results in disease progression, referred to as the cardiorenal syndrome. 
Traditionally, this relationship was deemed to be a consequence of an 
impairment in forward flow (cardiac output) leading to a decrease in 
renal arterial perfusion, worsening renal function, and neurohormonal 
activation with release of arginine vasopressin, resulting in water and 
sodium retention. However, evidence has emerged that renal dysfunc-
tion  may  not  be  adequately  explained  simply  by  arterial  underfilling 
and  a  decline  in  cardiac  output.  Systemic  venous  congestion  in  HF 
with increased backward pressure may be operative in determining the 
development  of  the  cardiorenal  syndrome,  and  relief  of  venous  con-
gestion  is  associated  with  significant  improvement  in  renal  function 
in HF. Increased intraabdominal pressure, as noted in right-sided HF, 
and a rise in abdominal congestion are correlated with renal dysfunc-
tion in worsening HF. The interaction is not only confined to the renal 
component of the abdominal compartment but also involves the liver 
and spleen. The splanchnic veins serve as a blood reservoir and actively 

function  in  regulation  of  cardiac  preload  during  changes  in  volume 
status,  regulated  by  transmural  pressure  changes  or  mechanisms  of 
systemic  sympathetic  activation.  The  liver  and  spleen  participate  in 
determining volume regulation in HF in addition to several additional 
interactive pathways. Splanchnic congestion results in portal vein dis-
tension and activation of the hepatorenal reflex as well as the splenore-
nal  reflex,  which  induces  renal  vasoconstriction.  Thus,  decongestion 
in HF by diuretic therapy or mechanical means such as ultrafiltration 
reduces  volume,  but  also  facilitates  a  decrease  in  pressure  within  the 
abdominal  compartment,  and  this  combination  of  therapeutic  effect 
may serve to improve renal function in HF.
 ■ GUT CONGESTION, THE MICROBIOME, AND 
INFLAMMATION
As  noted  above,  circulating  levels  of  proinflammatory  cytokines  are 
elevated  in  a  number  of  cardiovascular  disease  states,  including  HF, 
and have been associated with disease progression. While the primary 
source of inflammation is unknown, emerging evidence suggests that 
an alteration in gut microbial composition and loss of microbial diver-
sity may play an important role. The potential role of gut congestion and 
also altered gut microbial composition may propagate the chronic state 
of inflammation and immune system dysregulation, eventually leading 
to progression of HFrEF. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a gram-negative 
bacterial cell wall product whose levels are increased in patients with 
HF and increased intestinal permeability during periods of congestion, 
and reduced with diuretic treatment. LPS is a strong stimulator of the 
immune system and can lead to dysregulated systemic inflammation 
via  macrophage  activation.  Resulting  increases  in  cytokines  such  as 
TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 in these pathways can cause progressive loss of 
cardiac function and also contribute to cardiac cachexia. A mechanistic 
link  has  been  shown  between  gut  microbe–dependent  generation  of 
trimethylamine  N-oxide  derived  from  specific  dietary  nutrients  such 
as choline and carnitine and poor outcomes in patients with both acute 
and chronic HF. Microbe-generated uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sul-
fate, may play an important role in the development of HF, particularly 
in  interaction  with  renal  insufficiency.  Thus,  bowel  ischemia  and/or 
congestion depending on HF severity may be associated with morpho-
logic and functional alterations in the intestines and result in bacterial 
endotoxemia and a proinflammatory state.
 ■ HIGH-OUTPUT STATES
Although most patients with HF, with either reduced or preserved EF, 
have low or normal cardiac output (CO) accompanied by elevated sys-
temic vascular resistance (SVR), a minority of patients with HF present 
with  a  high-output  state  with  low  SVR  (Table  257-2).  High-output 
states by themselves are seldom responsible for HF, but their develop-
ment in the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease can precipi-
tate HF. For example, chronic anemia is associated with high CO when 
hemoglobin reduces significantly, for example, to a level that is ≤8 g/dL.  
An  increase  in  vasodilatory  metabolites  and  arteriolar  vasodilation 
in  response  to  decreased  oxygen-carrying  capacity  of  the  blood  in 
addition to a decrease in blood viscosity contributes to low SVR. Even 
when severe, anemia rarely causes high-output HF in the absence of a 
specific cardiac abnormality such as ischemic or valvular heart disease. 
Patients with end-stage renal disease (Chap. 312) are at particular risk 
of developing high-output HF when chronic anemia is exacerbated by 
increased  flow  through  an  arteriovenous  fistula.  In  a  contemporary 
series of patients with high-output HF, the most common causes were 
obesity  (31%),  liver  disease  (23%),  arteriovenous  shunts  (23%),  lung 
disease (16%), and myeloproliferative disorders (8%).

EVALUATION
 ■ HISTORY
Symptoms of Congestion: Pulmonary Versus Systemic  The 
most  common  symptoms  of  HF  are  related  to  volume  overload  with 
elevation in pulmonary and/or systemic venous pressures. Shortness of 
breath is a cardinal manifestation of left HF and may arise with increas-
ing  severity  as  exertional  dyspnea,  orthopnea,  paroxysmal  nocturnal

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT
Ordinary physical activity does not cause 
undue fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, or angina.
Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity 
(e.g., carrying heavy packages) may result in 
fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, or angina.
Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary 
physical activity (e.g., getting dressed) leads to 
symptoms.
Symptoms of heart failure or angina are 
present at rest and worsened with any activity.

dyspnea, and dyspnea at rest. Mechanisms of dyspnea include pulmo-
nary venous congestion and transudation of fluid into the interstitium 
and/or alveoli, leading to decreased lung compliance, increased airway 
resistance,  hypoxemia,  and  ventilation/perfusion  mismatch.  Stimula-
tion  of  juxtacapillary  J  receptors  leading  to  an  increased  ventilatory 
drive and reduced blood flow to respiratory muscles may cause lactic 
acidosis and a sensation of dyspnea. The New York Heart Association 
(NYHA)  functional  classification  (Table  257-4)  may  be  used  to  cat-
egorize  patients  based  on  the  amount  of  effort  required  to  provoke 
breathlessness. Notably, however, NYHA class does not correlate well 
with other objective measures of cardiac structure (e.g., left ventricular 
size, EF) or function (e.g., peak oxygen consumption).

Orthopnea refers to dyspnea that occurs in the recumbent position 
and is due to redistribution of fluid from the abdomen and lower body 
into the chest, increased work of breathing due to decreased lung com-
pliance, and, in patients with ascites or hepatomegaly, elevation of the 
diaphragm. Orthopnea typically occurs in the awake patient within 1–2 
min of lying down and may be relieved by raising the head and chest 
with pillows or an adjustable bed. With more severe HF, patients may 
end  up  sleeping  in  a  recliner  chair  or  sitting  up,  although  for  some, 
orthopnea  may  diminish  as  symptoms  of  right  HF  appear.  Ortho-
pnea may be accompanied by nocturnal cough related to pulmonary 
congestion.

Paroxysmal  nocturnal  dyspnea  (PND)  refers  to  episodes  of  short-
ness of breath that awaken a patient suddenly from sleep with feelings 
of anxiety and suffocation and require sitting upright for relief. In con-
trast to orthopnea, PND usually occurs after prolonged recumbency, 
is  less  predictable  in  occurrence,  and  may  require  30  min  or  longer 
in the upright position for relief. Episodes are often accompanied by 
coughing and wheezing (so-called cardiac asthma) thought to be due 
to increased bronchial arterial pressure leading to airway compression 
and interstitial pulmonary edema causing increased airway resistance. 
Acute  pulmonary  edema,  due  to  marked  elevation  of  the  pulmonary 
capillary  wedge  pressure,  is  manifested  by  severe  shortness  of  breath 
and pink, frothy sputum (Chap. 305). Cheyne-Stokes respiration and 
central  sleep  apnea  may  precipitate  episodes  of  PND  in  HF  and  are 
related  to  increased  sensitivity  of  the  respiratory  center  to  arterial 
PCO2 and a prolonged circulatory time. Unlike obstructive sleep apnea, 
which  can  be  treated  with  positive  airway  pressure  therapy,  central 
sleep  apnea  has  no  proven  therapy  beyond  the  directed  treatment  of 
HF (Chap. 297).

In contrast to symptoms of left HF due to pulmonary venous con-
gestion, symptoms of right HF are typically related to systemic venous 
congestion. Weight gain and lower extremity edema may be the initial 
manifestations  followed  by  a  range  of  gastrointestinal  symptoms  due 
to edema of the bowel wall and hepatic congestion. Abdominal bloat-
ing,  anorexia,  and  early  satiety  are  common.  Some  patients  develop 
right upper quadrant pain related to stretching of the hepatic capsule 
with nausea and vomiting. When these symptoms are associated with 
abnormal liver function tests (see below), misdiagnosis of biliary tract 
disease  may  occur.  For  patients  with  refractory  right  HF,  the  devel-
opment  of  massive  edema  involving  the  entire  body  with  recurrent 
pleural effusions and/or ascites is termed anasarca.

Symptoms of Reduced Perfusion  Some patients with advanced 
HF  present  with  symptoms  related  to  decreased  CO,  sometimes 
referred to as low-output syndrome. Fatigue and weakness, particularly 
of the lower extremities, are nonspecific symptoms that can occur with 
exertion  or  at  rest.  Pathophysiology  includes  reduced  blood  flow  to 
exercising muscles due to endothelial dysfunction and increased SVR 
from  neurohormonal  activation.  Chronic  alterations  in  skeletal  mus-
cle  structure  and  metabolism  have  also  been  demonstrated.  In  older 
patients  with  HF  and  cerebrovascular  disease,  reduced  systemic  per-
fusion may result in mental dullness, depressed affect, and confusion. 
In  addition  to  low  CO,  fatigue  may  be  caused  by  volume  depletion, 
hyponatremia, iron deficiency, and medications (e.g., beta blockers).

Other Symptoms  Patients with HF may present with mood distur-
bances and poor sleep, both of which may be exacerbated by nocturnal 
dyspnea and obstructive and/or central sleep apnea. Nocturia due to 
improved CO and renal perfusion in the supine position, in addition 
to  delayed  diuretic  effects,  can  also  contribute  to  sleep  disturbances. 
Oliguria due to severe reductions in renal blood flow may be a sign of 
advanced-stage HF.

Precipitating  Factors  Patients  with  HF  may  be  asymptomatic 
or mildly symptomatic either because the cardiac impairment is mild 
or  because  compensatory  mechanisms  help  to  balance  or  normalize 
cardiac function. Symptoms of HF may develop when one or more pre-
cipitating factors increase cardiac workload and disrupt the balance in 
favor of decompensation. Specific factors may be identified in 50–90% 
of  admissions  and  can  be  divided  into  patient-related  factors,  provider- 
related factors, HF-related disease states, and other causes (Table 257-5). 
Inability to recognize and correct these factors promptly may lead to 
persistent HF despite adequate treatment.

 ■ PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
General Appearance  Most patients with  mild-moderate HF will 
appear well nourished and comfortable at rest. Even patients with more 
advanced disease may be in no distress after resting for a few minutes 
but may demonstrate dyspnea with minimal exertion such as walking 
across the room. In contrast, patients with severe HF may need to sit 
upright  and  appear  anxious,  diaphoretic,  and  dyspneic  at  rest  with

pallor  due  to  anemia  or  duskiness  due  to  low  output.  Other  signs  of 
severe  HF  include  cool  extremities  and  peripheral  cyanosis.  Cardiac 
cachexia (Table 257-6), defined partially as unintentional edema-free 
weight loss of >5% over 12 months, may be observed in patients with 
longstanding,  severe  HF  as  bitemporal  or  upper  body  muscle  wast-
ing.  Contributing  factors  include  poor  oral  intake  due  to  anorexia, 
decreased  fat  absorption  due  to  bowel  wall  edema,  and  catabolic/
metabolic  imbalance  from  activation  of  inflammatory  cytokines  (see 
above) and dysregulation of the growth hormone–insulin-like growth 
factor 1 pathway. Rarely, scleral icterus and jaundice may result from 
severe right HF.

Vital Signs  With new-onset HF, heart rate rises and blood pressure 
may  initially  be  increased  due  to  sympathetic  activation.  In  patients 
with chronic HF on guideline-directed medical therapy, resting heart 
rate ideally should be <70–75 beats/min, and blood pressure should be 
in the normal to low-normal range. An irregular rhythm may be due 
to atrial fibrillation or flutter or frequent premature atrial or ventricular 
complexes. Severe HF may be associated with hypotension and narrow 
pulse  pressure  along  with  a  rapid,  thready  pulse.  An  alternatingly 
strong  and  weak  pulse,  known  as  pulsus  alternans,  is  attributed  to 
reduced left ventricular contraction in every other cardiac cycle due to 
incomplete recovery causing alternation in the left ventricular stroke 
volume.  Respiratory  rate  may  be  normal  at  rest  but  may  increase  on 
lying down or on minimal exertion. Advanced HF may be associated 
with periodic breathing or Cheyne-Stokes respirations. The patient is 
usually unaware of the altered breathing pattern, but family members 
or friends may become alarmed or attribute this incorrectly to anxiety. 
Oxygen saturation is typically normal on room air unless there is acute 
pulmonary edema, underlying CHD with shunting, severe pulmonary 
arterial hypertension, or concomitant acute or chronic lung disease. A 
low-grade fever resulting from cytokine activation may occur in severe 
HF and subside when compensation is restored.

Jugular Venous Pulse  Examination of the jugular veins provides 
an estimate of the right atrial pressure. Typically, the patient is exam-
ined at a 45° angle, and jugular venous pressure (JVP) is quantified in 
centimeters  of  water  by  estimating  the  height  of  the  venous  column 
of blood above the sternal angle in centimeters and then adding 5. In 
patients with mild right HF, JVP may be normal at rest (≤8 cmH2O) but 
increase with compression of the right upper quadrant. Hepatojugular 
reflux  is  elicited  by  applying  firm  continuous  pressure  over  the  liver 
for 15–30 s while observing the neck veins. The patient must breathe 
normally and not strain during the maneuver. Higher levels of venous 
pressure approaching the angle of the jaw are common in chronic right 
HF. If significant tricuspid regurgitation is present, prominent V waves 
and  Y  descents  may  be  noted.  The  abdominojugular  test,  defined  as 
an increase in right atrial pressure during 10 s of firm midabdominal 
compression followed by an abrupt drop on pressure release, suggests 
elevated  left-sided  filling  pressure.  A  rise  in  JVP  with  inspiration  or 
Kussmaul’s sign may be due to severe biventricular HF and is a marker 
of poor outcome.

Lung  Examination  Pulmonary  rales  result  from  transudation  of 
fluid from the intravascular space into the alveoli and airways. In gen-
eral, rales are heard at the lung bases, but in severe HF or acute pulmo-
nary edema, they may be heard throughout the lung fields. Wheezing 
and rhonchi can occur with congestion of the bronchial mucosa and 
sometimes  lead  to  a  misdiagnosis  (and  inappropriate  treatment)  of 
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rales may 
be  absent  in  patients  with  longstanding  HF  and  chronically  elevated 
pulmonary  capillary  wedge  pressures  due  to  increased  lymphatic 
drainage, which prevents spillage from the interstitium into the alveoli. 
In biventricular or predominant right HF, bilateral pleural effusions are 
recognized as dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds at 
the bases. When pleural effusions are unilateral, they typically involve 
the right side.

Cardiac  Examination  As  discussed  above,  chronic  HF  with 
ventricular remodeling is accompanied by cardiac enlargement. The 
apical impulse is displaced downward and to the left and may be dif-
fuse  in  dilated  cardiomyopathy  or  sustained  in  pressure  overloaded 
states  such  as  aortic  stenosis.  In  biventricular  or  severe  right  HF,  a 
right ventricular heave or parasternal lift may be palpated along the 
left sternal border. Uncommonly, a palpable third heart sound may be 
present. In patients with HFpEF, precordial palpation is often normal. 
On auscultation, an S3 gallop is most commonly present in patients 
with volume overload and tachycardia, suggests severe hemodynamic 
compromise, and carries negative prognostic significance. An S4 gal-
lop is not specific to HF but may be present in patients with HFpEF 
due  to  hypertension.  Holosystolic  murmurs  of  mitral  and  tricuspid 
regurgitation are present in the setting of advanced HF, often in the 
absence of structural valvular abnormalities. In patients with second-
ary  pulmonary  hypertension,  a  loud  pulmonary  component  of  the 
second heart sound may be heard.

Abdomen and Extremities  Hepatomegaly is an early sign of sys-
temic venous congestion. The liver edge may be tender due to stretch-
ing  of  the  capsule,  but  with  progression  of  right  HF,  tenderness  may 
disappear.  The  liver  edge  may  be  pulsatile  in  patients  with  tricuspid 
regurgitation. Longstanding hepatic congestion may result in cardiac 
cirrhosis  with  congestive  splenomegaly  and  mild-moderate  ascites. 
The presence of massive ascites should lead to a search for other causes 
such  as  constrictive  pericarditis  or  primary  liver  failure.  Dependent 
lower  extremity  edema  is  common  in  chronic  HF  and  is  typically 
symmetric and pitting. Over time, chronic edema may cause redden-
ing and induration of the skin, become weeping, or lead to cellulitis. 
Anasarca is used to describe massive, generalized edema involving the 
legs, sacrum, and abdominal wall. In patients with acute HF or younger 
adults with chronic HF, lower extremity edema may be absent despite 
marked  systemic  venous  hypertension.  Unilateral  lower  extremity 
edema may be due to deep venous thrombosis, prior trauma, or history 
of  vein  harvest  for  bypass  surgery.  Nonpitting  edema  that  does  not 
respond  to  increasing  doses  of  diuretics  may  represent  lymphedema 
that requires alternative diagnostic workup and treatment.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The  diagnosis  of  HF  is  relatively  straightforward  when  the  patient 
presents  with  typical  signs  and  symptoms;  however,  the  signs  and 
symptoms  of  HF  are  neither  specific  nor  sensitive.  It  is  therefore 
important  for  clinicians  to  have  a  high  index  of  suspicion  for  HF, 
particularly in patients who are at increased risk, including older patients 
with underlying cardiovascular disease and those with comorbidities such 
hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. In this setting, addi-
tional laboratory testing and imaging should be performed (Fig. 257-6).

Routine  Laboratories  Standard  laboratory  testing  in  patients 
with  HF  includes  a  comprehensive  metabolic  panel,  complete  blood 
count,  coagulation  studies,  and  urinalysis.  Selected  patients  should 
have assessment for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and thyroid function. Blood 
urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are often elevated in moderate-severe 
HF  due  to  reduced  renal  blood  flow  and/or  increased  renal  venous 
pressure.  Worsening  renal  function  (Chaps.  310  and  311)  due  to

FIGURE  257-6  Initial  assessment  of  patients  presenting  with  heart  failure.  The 
initial evaluation starts with a thorough history and physical examination, focusing 
on detection of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. 
In  addition,  identification  of  valvular  heart  disease,  vascular  disease,  history  of 
mediastinal radiation, or exposure to cardiotoxins (e.g., chemotherapy, alcohol, or 
illicit drugs) may help determine underlying cause. A family history of sudden death, 
heart  failure,  arrhythmias,  or  cardiomyopathy  is  also  useful.  Routine  laboratory 
evaluation  (see  text)  should  also  be  performed.  Chest  x-ray  is  useful  to  detect 
cardiomegaly  and  fluid  overload  and  to  rule  out  pulmonary  disease.  A  12-lead 
electrocardiogram should be performed to detect abnormalities of cardiac rhythm 
and conduction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and evidence of myocardial ischemia 
or infarction. Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler imaging is indicated 
to  assess  cardiovascular  structure  and  function  and  detect  abnormalities  of  the 
myocardium, heart valves, or pericardium. Further imaging and laboratory studies 
aimed  at  identifying  a  specific  cause  of  cardiomyopathy  depend  on  information 
obtained from the history and physical examination. In all patients, risk stratification 
should  be  performed  to  assess  severity  of  illness,  guide  therapy,  and  provide 
prognosis  to  patient  and  family.  CMR,  cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging;  CT, 
computed tomography; NYHA, New York Heart Association; PET, positron emission 
tomography.

diuretics,  RAAS  inhibitors,  and  noncardiac  medications  (e.g.,  non-
steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs)  is  also  common.  Proteinuria  may 
be present in the setting of longstanding hypertension or diabetes or 
suggest  an  underlying  systemic  disease.  Chronic  right  HF  with  con-
gestive hepatomegaly can lead to modest elevations in transaminases, 
alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin that should not be confused with 
biliary tract disease. Marked elevation in transaminases and lactic acid 
suggest cardiogenic shock with severe low output. In patients with car-
diac cirrhosis, hypoalbuminemia may exacerbate fluid accumulation, 
whereas  hyperammonemia  contributes  to  altered  mental  status.  In 
general, inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 
C-reactive protein, and uric acid are nonspecific and do not aid in the 
diagnosis of HF. Other laboratories, including antinuclear antibodies, 
rheumatoid factor, serum free light chains, serum protein electropho-
resis,  ferritin,  ceruloplasmin,  hepatitis  C,  and  HIV,  are  reserved  for 
targeted testing.

Electrolyte abnormalities seen in HF include hyponatremia due to 
sodium  restriction,  diuretic  therapy,  and  vasopressin-mediated  free 
water  retention.  Hyponatremia  is  a  negative  prognostic  indicator  at 
the time of HF hospitalization and predicts decreased long-term sur-
vival (Table 257-1). Hypokalemia is most often due to thiazide or loop 
diuretics given without oral potassium supplementation but may also 
result from increased aldosterone levels. Hyperkalemia may result from 
marked reductions in glomerular filtration rate and is exacerbated by 

use of RAAS inhibitors and potassium-sparing diuretics (Chap. 258). 
Hypo- or hyperkalemia may lead to atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. 
Hypophosphatemia  and  hypomagnesemia  are  commonly  associated 
with chronic alcohol use.

Anemia is not diagnostic of HF, but when present, it may exacerbate 
underlying  ischemic  heart  disease  and  should  be  corrected.  Rarely, 
severe  anemia  may  cause  high-output  HF  typically  in  the  presence 
of underlying cardiovascular disease. The presence of iron deficiency 
(with  or  without  anemia)  is  increasingly  recognized  in  patients  with 
chronic  HF  and  has  been  attributed  to  decreased  gut  absorption, 
impaired  hepatic  storage,  and  chronic  blood  loss.  Repletion  with  IV 
iron results in improved symptoms and exercise capacity and reduced 
HF hospitalizations, but its effect on survival remains uncertain.

Chest X-Ray  Major abnormalities on chest imaging associated with 
left HF include enlarged cardiac silhouette (cardiothoracic ratio >0.5) 
and pulmonary venous congestion. Early radiologic signs of acute HF 
include upper zone venous redistribution and thickening of interlob-
ular septa. When the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is moderate 
to  severely  elevated,  alveolar  edema  can  present  as  diffuse  haziness 
extending downward toward the lower lung fields. The absence of these 
findings in patients with chronic HF reflects the increased capacity of 
the lymphatics to remove interstitial and/or pulmonary fluid. Pleural 
effusions of varying size and distribution are common in biventricular 
HF. Chest x-ray can also be used to identify noncardiac causes of dys-
pnea (e.g., pneumonia, COPD).

Electrocardiogram  No  specific  electrocardiographic  (ECG)  pat-
tern is diagnostic of HF. Rather, the ECG may provide important infor-
mation regarding presence of underlying cardiac disease. For example, 
left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement suggest HFpEF 
due to hypertension, aortic stenosis, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
The presence of Q waves or infarction is suggestive of ischemic heart 
disease,  whereas  Q  waves  with  reduced  QRS  voltage  (pseudo-infarct 
pattern) may be seen with restrictive or infiltrative cardiomyopathies 
(e.g.,  amyloid).  Conduction  system  disease  should  raise  concern  for 
cardiac sarcoid or Chagas cardiomyopathy in the right clinical setting.
Paroxysmal  or  persistent  atrial  fibrillation  is  present  in  up  to  40% 
of patients with chronic HF and is an indication for anticoagulation. 
Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and nonsustained ventricular 
tachycardia  can  reflect  worsening  HF  and  are  markers  of  increased 
risk. Conversely, frequent PVCs can cause cardiomyopathy that may be 
treated successfully with ablation (Chap. 253). Finally, determination 
of the QRS width and presence of LBBB is used to ascertain whether 
the patient may benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy.

Noninvasive Imaging  Noninvasive cardiac imaging (Chap. 241) 
is  essential  for  the  diagnosis,  evaluation,  and  management  of  HF. 
Two-dimensional  echocardiography  provides  an  accurate  and  rapid 
determination of ventricular size and function and valvular morphol-
ogy and function and can detect intracavitary thrombi and pericardial 
effusions. When left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is ≥50%, sys-
tolic function is deemed to be normal. Myocardial strain rate imaging 
using speckle tracking can add incremental value to LVEF and carries 
prognostic value. Doppler techniques can be used to estimate CO, pul-
monary artery pressures, and valve areas, and may detect abnormalities 
in left ventricular diastolic filling in patients with HFpEF. For patients 
with end-stage HF, echocardiography is critical for assessment of right 
ventricular  function  before  and  after  mechanical  circulatory  support 
and heart transplant. Transesophageal echocardiogram is indicated to 
rule out atrial thrombi prior to cardioversion and can assess aortic or 
mitral valve pathology in planning for transcatheter valvular replace-
ment or repair.

Cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (CMR)  has  emerged  as  a 
highly accurate and quantitative tool for evaluation of left ventricular 
mass, volumes, and function and for determining specific causes of HF 
(e.g.,  ischemic  cardiomyopathy,  myocarditis,  amyloidosis,  hemochro-
matosis).  CMR  is  particularly  helpful  in  defining  multiple  anatomic 
and functional abnormalities in adults with CHD. Serial CMR studies 
can assess ventricular remodeling in response to therapy and are useful

in clinic research. For patients who cannot undergo CMR (e.g., due to 
implantable  devices),  cardiac  computed  tomography  (CT)  is  partic-
ularly helpful to rule out pericardial disease or left ventricular apical 
thrombus.  While  limited  by  availability  and  cost,  cardiac  positron 
emission  tomography  (PET)  plays  a  role  in  evaluating  the  extent  of 
ischemia or infarction in patients with coronary artery disease and, in 
the case of sarcoid, can reliably determine the severity and distribution 
of cardiac inflammation.
Cardiopulmonary  Exercise  Testing  While  not  routinely  per-
formed  in  HF,  cardiopulmonary  exercise  testing  using  a  symptom- 
limited,  ramp  protocol  can  provide  an  objective  assessment  of  peak 
functional  capacity  in  patients  being  evaluated  for  mechanical  circu-
latory  support  or  heart  transplant  (Chap.  260).  Several  parameters 
including  absolute  and  percent-predicted  peak  oxygen  consumption 
(VO2) and ventilatory efficiency (assessed by the VE/VCO2 slope) are 
independent  predictors  of  survival.  Additional  data  including  heart 
rate  and  blood  pressure  response  to  exercise  and  exercise-induced 
arrhythmias can also be assessed. This test may also be useful in defin-
ing the cause of dyspnea when the diagnosis is uncertain.
Biomarkers  Circulating  levels  of  natriuretic  peptides  are  useful, 
adjunctive tools in the diagnosis of HF. BNP and N-terminal pro-BNP 
(NT-proBNP) are released from the atria and ventricles in response to 
increased  wall  stress.  Patients  with  HFrEF  tend  to  have  higher  levels 
than patients with HFpEF, whereas levels may be falsely low in obesity. 
In  ambulatory  patients  with  dyspnea,  the  measurement  of  BNP  or 
NT-proBNP  is  useful  to  support  clinical  decision-making  regarding 
the diagnosis of HF, especially in the setting of clinical uncertainty or 
with  concomitant  lung  disease.  Moreover,  natriuretic  peptide  levels 
can be used to establish disease severity and prognosis in chronic HF 
and may help to guide optimal dosing of medical therapy in stable out-
patients. Importantly, many noncardiac factors, including age, female 
sex,  and  chronic  kidney  disease,  increase  natriuretic  peptide  levels. 
Other cardiovascular diseases including atrial fibrillation, pulmonary 
embolism, and pulmonary arterial hypertension can also increase BNP 
levels. Galectin-3 and soluble ST2 are newer biomarkers that have been 
approved for assessment of prognosis in HF but are not widely used. 
Biomarkers of renal injury require further study in HF.
Invasive  Studies 
In  the  intensive  care  setting,  assessment  of 
cardiac  filling  pressures  and  CO  may  be  necessary  to  differentiate 
cardiogenic  from  noncardiogenic  pulmonary  edema  and  manage 
hemodynamic  instability.  Placement  of  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter 
can be performed safely at the bedside and used to determine response 
to  intravenous  vasoactive  and  diuretic  therapy  in  severe  HF.  Simul-
taneous  measurement  of  right  and  left  heart  filling  pressures  in  the 
cardiac catheterization laboratory can be used to distinguish restrictive 
cardiomyopathy from constrictive pericarditis. Coronary angiography 
is indicated to exclude ischemic heart disease as an underlying, poten-
tially reversible cause of left ventricular dysfunction. The management 
of coronary artery disease in the setting of chronic HF is discussed in 
Chaps.  274–276.  If  echocardiographic  windows  are  suboptimal,  left 
ventriculography  can  provide  an  assessment  of  left  ventricular  size 
and  function  and  severity  of  mitral  regurgitation.  The  role  of  right 
ventricular  endomyocardial  biopsy  in  the  management  of  HF  and 
cardiomyopathy  remains  controversial.  Indications  include  detection 
of  myocarditis,  diagnosis  of  cardiac  amyloidosis  and  chemotherapy- 
related left ventricular failure, and screening for cardiac allograft rejec-
tion following heart transplant.

COMORBIDITIES
 ■ DIABETES
Type  2  diabetes  mellitus  is  a  risk  factor  for  the  development  of  HF 
(Table  257-7)  and  increases  the  risk  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in 
patients with established disease. In ambulatory HF cohorts, the preva-
lence of diabetes ranges from 10 to 40%, with prevalence even higher in 
patients hospitalized with HF. When the two diseases coexist, patients 
are  at  increased  risk  for  adverse  outcomes,  worse  quality  of  life,  and 
higher costs of care. Recent data from cardiovascular outcomes trials

demonstrate that HF is a critical outcome in patients with diabetes and 
that  glucose-lowering  therapies  can  impact  morbidity  and  mortality. 
As discussed above, SGLT-2 inhibitors in particular have not only been 
shown to be safe in patients with HF but can also improve renal func-
tion  and  decrease  the  risk  of  hospitalization  and  death.  Use  of  other 
guideline-directed  medical  therapy  is  indicated  in  patients  with  HF 
regardless of diabetes status.
 ■ SLEEP APNEA
Sleep-disordered breathing is common in HF, with increased incidence 
of both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea (Chap. 297). 
The  pathophysiologic  link  between  these  disorders  has  been  studied 
in both animal models and humans and includes increased afterload, 
decreased  preload,  intermittent  hypoxia,  and  sympathetic  activation. 
Increase  in  sympathetic  tone  can  provoke  ischemia  and  arrhythmias 
and  complicate  blood  pressure  management.  Approximately  one-third 
of  patients  with  HF  and  sleep-disordered  breathing  have  central  sleep 
apnea, which is associated with increased mortality independent of other 
known risk factors. In patients with HFrEF and obstructive sleep apnea, 
continuous positive airway pressure has been shown to improve quality 
of life, decrease blood pressure and arrhythmias, and increase EF. Unlike 
obstructive  sleep  apnea,  there  is  no  proven  therapy  for  central  sleep 
apnea, although the role of nocturnal oxygen is currently being tested.

 ■ OBESITY
Similar  to  diabetes,  obesity  is  both  a  risk  factor  for  the  development 
of HF and highly prevalent in patients with HF. In particular, obesity 
is  common  in  patients  with  HFpEF  and  complicates  the  assessment 
of  volume  status  in  both  ambulatory  and  inpatient  settings.  Unlike 
diabetes, the risk of morbidity and mortality in obese patients with HF 
is  complex.  The  obesity  paradox  refers  to  the  observation  that  obese 
patients  diagnosed  with  HF  have  a  more  favorable  prognosis  than 
patients with low or even normal body mass index. While weight loss 
has  been  shown  to  improve  quality  of  life  and  exercise  capacity  and 
may contribute to reverse ventricular remodeling in patients with HF, 
the impact on survival is unknown.

 ■ DEPRESSION
Depression is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in HF 
(Table 257-1), especially in older women. The mechanisms underlying 
this risk remain unknown but may involve neuroendocrine dysfunc-
tion  and  systemic  inflammation,  as  well  as  contributions  from  poor 
sleep, decreased appetite, and adverse effects of medications and alco-
hol. The AHA recommends screening for depression among patients 
with  cardiovascular  disease  including  HF  using  validated  patient 
health questionnaires. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are safe 
for treating depression in HF but do not appear to affect the natural 
history of disease. The effect of cognitive behavioral therapy and the 
collaborative care model, as well as newer therapies such as transcranial

study.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Many  symptoms  and  signs  suggesting  HF  may  be  caused  by  other 
conditions (Table 257-8). In a patient with dyspnea, the clinician must 
distinguish cardiac from pulmonary causes, although the differentia-
tion may be difficult. For example, orthopnea may be a well-established 
symptom in some patients with severe chronic lung disease. Patients 
with  underlying  pulmonary  disease  may  also  experience  episodic 
shortness of breath during sleep that mimics PND. In chronic lung dis-
ease, this is usually due to accumulation of tracheobronchial secretions 
and is relieved by coughing and expectoration, whereas in cardiac dis-
ease, the patient has to sit upright. Wheezing caused by bronchocon-
striction  may  be  a  prominent  symptom  when  left  ventricular  failure 
supervenes in individuals with reactive airways disease. Patients with 
cardiac asthma may be more likely to exhibit diaphoresis and varying 
degrees of cyanosis compared to patients with bronchial asthma. Dif-
ferentiating  dyspnea  related  to  HF  versus  pulmonary  disease  may  be 
impossible  when  the  diseases  coexist,  a  situation  that  is  common  in 
chronically ill older patients with active or prior smoking. Following 
effective diuresis, pulmonary function tests may help to determine the 
predominant cause of dyspnea. In ambulatory patients with advanced 
HF, cardiopulmonary exercise testing can also help to make this dis-
tinction. Finally, a very low BNP or NT-proBNP level may be helpful in 
excluding HF as the cause of dyspnea in nonobese patients.

Apart from pulmonary disease, HF needs to be distinguished from 
conditions in which congestion results from abnormal salt and water 
retention but in which cardiac structure and function are normal (e.g., 
renal failure) and from noncardiac causes of pulmonary edema (e.g., 
acute respiratory distress syndrome). Non-HF causes of lower extrem-
ity  edema  such  as  venous  insufficiency,  lymphedema,  and  obesity 
should also be considered.

258 Heart Failure:  
Management
Akshay S. Desai, Mandeep R. Mehra

Clinical management of patients with heart failure (HF) varies widely 
based on the clinical phenotype at presentation. Those in the earliest 
stage of disease with asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction (American 
College  of  Cardiology  [ACC]/American  Heart  Association  [AHA] 
stage  B)  may  be  amenable  to  treatment  with  neurohormonal  antag-
onists,  including  angiotensin-converting  inhibitors  and  β-adrenergic 
receptor antagonists, with the goal of facilitating ventricular recovery 
and preventing the development of clinical HF (not further discussed). 
Those  with  symptomatic  HF  (ACC/AHA  stage  C)  comprise  a  het-
erogeneous  group  in  whom  the  approach  to  therapy  is  differentiated 
largely based on measurement of the left ventricular ejection fraction. 
Data from prospective, randomized clinical outcomes trials enrolling 
patients with symptomatic chronic HF and reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) has provided a rich evidence base that supports the efficacy 
of  stepped  pharmacologic  therapy  with  neurohormonal  antagonists, 
including  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system  (RAAS)  antagonists, 
neprilysin  inhibitors,  β-adrenergic  receptor  antagonists,  and  miner-
alocorticoid  receptor  antagonists,  as  a  complement  to  device-based 
treatment  with  cardiac  resynchronization  therapy  and  implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillators.  By  contrast,  treatment  of  patients  with 
symptomatic  chronic  HF  and  preserved  ejection  fraction  (HFpEF) 
has remained heavily symptom-focused owing to the lack of evidence 
to  support  specific  pharmacologic  therapies  to  modify  disease  pro-
gression.  Even  with  effective  therapy,  patients  with  both  HFrEF  and 
HFpEF are at risk for clinical deterioration, typically as a consequence 
of progressive sodium and fluid retention that fuels the development 
of congestive symptoms and acute decompensated HF (ADHF). Man-
agement  of  these  exacerbations  (frequently  hospital-based)  is  heavily 
focused on hemodynamic stabilization, decongestion, and institution 
of  appropriate  disease-modifying  therapy  in  the  transition  back  to 
chronic ambulatory management. Recurrent episodes of ADHF despite 
careful longitudinal follow-up and effective treatment may signal the 
onset  of  an  advanced  or  refractory  HF  phenotype  (ACC/AHA  stage 
D) in which the risk of mortality from sudden death or end-stage HF 
is high, and consideration of salvage therapies including cardiac trans-
plant  or  mechanical  circulatory  support  may  be  appropriate  prior  to 
escalation of palliative measures (Chap. 260).

HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED 
EJECTION FRACTION
 ■ GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Although  clinical  trials  of  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  antagonists, 
digoxin, β-adrenergic receptor blockers, and neprilysin inhibitors have 
been conducted in patients with HFpEF, none has conclusively demon-
strated a mortality reduction. In the absence of specific pharmacologic 
therapies proven to improve clinical outcomes, management of patients 
with  HFpEF  is  therefore  focused  on  improving  symptoms  and  effort 
tolerance through lifestyle modification, control of congestion, stabi-
lization of heart rhythm (particularly in those with atrial fibrillation), 
control of blood pressure to guideline-recommended targets, and man-
agement  of  comorbidities  that  may  contribute  to  disease  progression 
(including, for example, obesity, obstructive lung disease, obstructive 
sleep  apnea,  diabetes/insulin  resistance,  anemia,  iron  deficiency,  and 
chronic kidney disease).

 ■ CLINICAL TRIALS IN HFpEF
Attempts to export the benefits of drugs that improve clinical outcomes 
in  patients  with  HFrEF,  including  angiotensin-converting  enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), β-adrenergic 
receptor  blockers,  digoxin,  and  mineralocorticoid  receptor  antag-
onists,  to  those  with  HFpEF  have  generally  been  unsuccessful.  The 
Candesartan in Heart Failure—Assessment of Mortality and Morbidity 
(CHARM)  Preserved  study  showed  a  statistically  significant  reduc-
tion  in  HF  hospitalizations  but  no  difference  in  all-cause  mortality 
in patients with HFpEF who were treated with the ARB candesartan. 
Similarly, the Irbesartan in Heart Failure with Preserved Systolic Func-
tion (I-PRESERVE) trial demonstrated no differences in the composite 
of  cardiovascular  death  or  HF  hospitalization  during  treatment  with 
the ARB irbesartan compared with placebo. Apparent early benefits of 
the ACE inhibitor perindopril on HF hospitalizations and functional 
capacity in the Perindopril in Elderly People with Chronic Heart Fail-
ure (PEP-CHF) study were attenuated over longer-duration follow-up. 
The  Digitalis  Investigation  Group  (DIG)  Ancillary  Trial  found  no 
impact of digoxin on all-cause mortality or on all-cause or cardiovas-
cular hospitalization among patients with chronic HF, ejection fraction 
(EF) >45%, and sinus rhythm, although a modest reduction in HF hos-
pitalizations was noted. Although no dedicated study of beta blockers 
has  been  conducted  in  HFpEF,  the  subgroup  of  elderly  patients  with 
prior hospitalization and HFpEF enrolled in the Study of the Effects of 
Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalization in Seniors 
with  Heart  Failure  (SENIORS)  trial  of  nebivolol,  a  vasodilating  beta 
blocker, did not appear to experience significant reductions in all-cause 
or cardiovascular mortality.

With  regard  to  mineralocorticoid  receptor  antagonists,  which  have 
potent antifibrotic effects in HFrEF, the Treatment of Preserved Car-
diac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) 
trial  explored  the  potential  benefit  of  spironolactone  compared  to 
placebo  in  HFpEF.  This  trial  demonstrated  no  improvement  in  the 
primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, HF hospitaliza-
tions, or aborted cardiac arrest but did show a reduction in HF hospi-
talizations among those allocated to spironolactone. Post hoc analyses 
of the study suggested significant regional differences in the baseline 
characteristics, event rates, adverse effects, and adherence to spirono-
lactone  among  patients  randomized  in  Russia  and  the  Republic  of 
Georgia compared with those randomized in the Americas that raised 
concerns about study conduct in Russian and Georgian sites. Apparent 
reductions in cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization associated 
with spironolactone among the subgroup of patients randomized in the 
Americas suggest that these study design issues may have obscured a 
signal of spironolactone benefit. These data have supported a weak rec-
ommendation for spironolactone in patients with HFpEF who meet the 
inclusion criteria for the TOPCAT trial and are at low risk for adverse 
effects,  including  hyperkalemia  and  worsening  renal  function,  in  
the most recent U.S. and European guidelines. However, the results of 
the Aldosterone Receptor Blockade in Diastolic Heart Failure (ALDO-
DHF)  study  in  which  spironolactone  improved  echocardiographic 

indices of diastolic dysfunction but failed to improve exercise capacity, 
symptoms,  or  quality-of-life  (QOL)  measures  highlight  the  need  for 
further  study.  Ongoing  trials,  including  the  registry-based  Spirono-
lactone  Initiation  Registry  Randomized  Interventional  Trial  in  Heart 
Failure  with  Preserved  Ejection  Fraction  (SPIRRIT-HFpEF)  (SPIR-
RIT-HFpEF;  clinicaltrials.gov  identifier  NCT02901184)  and  the  ran-
domized  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Finerenone  on 
Morbidity  and  Mortality  in  Participants  with  Heart  Failure  and  Left 
Ventricular  Ejection  Fraction  Greater  than  or  Equal  to  40%  (FINE-
ARTS-HF,  clinicaltrials.gov  identifier:  NCT04435626)  may  provide 
additional insight in this regard.

In  contrast  to  the  rather  disappointing  results  of  these  studies  of 
targeted  drug  therapy,  small  studies  of  exercise  training  in  patients 
with HFpEF have suggested benefits on functional capacity and QOL, 
indicating a possible role for lifestyle interventions to improve cardio-
respiratory fitness in this population.

 ■ NOVEL TARGETS
A  novel  paradigm  for  understanding  the  pathophysiology  of  HFpEF 
has  focused  on  the  role  of  microvascular  endothelial  inflammation 
driven  by  comorbidities  that  results  in  impaired  nitric  oxide  (NO) 
signaling and associated increases in myocardial stiffening. This para-
digm has emphasized the potential for improving outcomes in HFpEF 
by  enhancing  NO  bioavailability  and  improving  downstream  protein 
kinase  G–based  signaling.  In  this  regard,  a  small  trial  demonstrated 
that the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil improved filling pres-
sures and right ventricular function in a cohort of HFpEF patients with 
pulmonary venous hypertension. This finding led to the phase 2 trial, 
Phosphodiesterase-5  Inhibition  to  Improve  Clinical  Status  and  Exer-
cise Capacity in Diastolic Heart Failure (RELAX), in HFpEF patients 
(left ventricular EF [LVEF] >50%) with New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) functional class II or III symptoms, who received sildenafil at 
20 mg three times daily for 3 months, followed by 60 mg three times 
daily  for  another  3  months,  compared  with  a  placebo.  There  was  no 
improvement in functional capacity, QOL, or other clinical and surro-
gate parameters in those allocated to sildenafil compared to placebo. 
On  the  premise  that  nitrates,  which  are  NO  donors,  might  improve 
preload, coronary perfusion, endothelial function, and exercise toler-
ance,  the  Nitrate’s  Effect  on  Activity  Tolerance  in  Heart  Failure  with 
Preserved  Ejection  Fraction  (NEAT-HFpEF)  study  was  conducted. 
Isosorbide  mononitrate  did  not  improve  QOL  or  submaximal  exer-
cise  capacity  and  decreased  overall  activity  levels  in  treated  patients. 
Inorganic  nitrate  compounds  have  also  been  shown  to  enhance  NO 
signaling  but  did  not  improve  functional  capacity  compared  to  pla-
cebo among patients with HFpEF randomized in the Inorganic Nitrite 
Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved 
Ejection Fraction (INDIE-HFpEF) trial.

Neprilysin  inhibition  is  known  to  increase  circulating  levels  of 
various vasoactive peptides, including the natriuretic peptides, which 
may  facilitate  cyclic  guanosine  3′,5′-monophosphate  based  signaling, 
enhance  myocardial  relaxation,  and  reduce  ventricular  hypertrophy. 
Composite  angiotensin  receptor-neprilysin  inhibition  (ARNI)  with 
sacubitril-valsartan reduced cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, 
and HF hospitalization compared with enalapril among patients with 
HFrEF randomized in the PARADIGM-HF trial. The PARAGON-HF 
trial  randomized  4822  patients  with  symptomatic  HFpEF  (LVEF 
≥45%),  elevated  natriuretic  peptides,  and  structural  heart  disease  to 
treatment  with  either  sacubitril-valsartan  or  valsartan  with  the  novel 
composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death and total hospi-
talizations for HF. Although there was a 13% reduction in the rate of 
the primary composite endpoint in those allocated to sacubitril-valsartan, 
this  result  narrowly  missed  the  margin  for  statistical  significance  in 
the  primary  statistical  analysis  (p  =  .06).  Directional  benefits  in  sec-
ondary  endpoints  including  QOL,  NYHA  class,  and  renal  function 
favoring sacubitril-valsartan support a possible modest benefit of nepr-
ilysin  inhibition  in  this  population,  particularly  among  patients  with 
lower  (i.e.,  mildly  reduced  or  mid-range)  EF  and  women,  subgroups 
who  appeared  to  derive  greater  benefit.  On  the  basis  of  these  data,  
sacubitril-valsartan  has  recently  been  approved  in  the  United  States

for treatment of symptomatic heart failure across the full spectrum of 
ejection  fraction,  with  benefits  acknowledged  to  be  greatest  in  those 
with LVEF below normal. Further study may be required to define the 
optimal therapeutic role for neprilysin inhibition in HFpEF.

Treatment of diabetic patients with inhibitors of the sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2  (SGLT-2)  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  incidence  of 
HF, raising the possibility that these agents may be effective in patients 
with established HF. Addition of the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin 
to  guideline-directed  medical  therapy  of  HFrEF  was  associated  with 
reductions in cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalization among 
patients with and without diabetes enrolled in the Dapagliflozin and Pre-
vention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) study. Ongo-
ing clinical trials of dapagliflozin (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve 
the  Lives  of  Patients  with  Preserved  Ejection  Fraction  Heart  Failure 
[DELIVER];  clinicaltrials.gov  identifier:  NCT03619213)  and  empag-
liflozin (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart 
Failure  with  Preserved  Ejection  Fraction  [EMPEROR-PRESERVED];  
clinicaltrials.gov  identifier:  NCT03057951)  will  assess  whether  these 
benefits  can  be  extended  to  the  population  of  patients  with  HFpEF, 
both with and without diabetes.
 ■ CLINICAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES
In the absence of evidence-based, targeted medical therapy, treatment 
of  HFpEF  should  focus  on  decongestion,  aggressive  management  of 
medical  comorbidities,  and  relief  of  exacerbating  factors.  A  careful 
diagnostic  approach  is  critical,  since  patients  with  HF  and  a  normal 
or  near  normal  LVEF  compose  a  heterogenous  group  that  includes 
patients  with  infiltrative  heart  disease  (amyloidosis,  hemochromato-
sis,  sarcoidosis),  storage  disease  (Fabry’s  disease,  Gaucher’s  disease), 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, pulmonary arterial 
hypertension,  valvular  heart  disease,  and  primary  right  ventricular 

failure who may require a different management approach. For those 
with  true  HFpEF,  aggressive  control  of  blood  pressure  to  guideline- 
recommended targets and relief of volume overload with diuretics are 
critical to symptom relief. Excessive decrease in preload with diuretics 
and vasodilators may lead to underfilling the ventricle and subsequent 
azotemia, hypotension, and syncope. For patients at risk for coronary 
heart disease, deliberate evaluation for ischemia and consideration of 
coronary  revascularization  is  important.  Since  clinical  outcomes  in 
HFpEF  are  worse  in  the  setting  of  atrial  fibrillation,  aggressive  rate 
control, anticoagulation, and early consideration of sinus rhythm res-
toration are important. Comorbidities such as obesity, obstructive lung 
disease,  sleep  apnea,  chronic  kidney  disease,  and  anemia/iron  defi-
ciency are increasingly recognized as important contributors to dimin-
ished functional capacity and QOL in patients with HFpEF and may be 
additional targets for therapy. Some investigators have suggested that 
the exercise intolerance in HFpEF is a manifestation of chronotropic 
insufficiency and that such aberrations could be corrected with use of 
rate responsive pacemakers, but this remains an inadequately investi-
gated contention (Fig. 258-1).

ACUTE DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE
 ■ GENERAL PRINCIPLES
ADHF  is  a  heterogeneous  clinical  syndrome  most  often  resulting  in 
need for hospitalization due to confluence of interrelated abnormalities 
of decreased cardiac performance, renal dysfunction, and alterations in 
vascular compliance. Admission with a diagnosis of ADHF is associ-
ated with excessive morbidity and mortality, with nearly half of these 
patients  readmitted  for  management  within  6  months,  and  a  high 
short-term  (5%  in-hospital)  and  long-term  cardiovascular  mortality 
(20%  at  1  year).  Importantly,  long-term  outcomes  remain  poor,  with

FIGURE 258-2  The distinctive phenotypes of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), their presentations, and suggested therapeutic routes. (Unique causes of ADHF, 
such as isolated right heart failure and pericardial disease, and rare causes, such as aortic and coronary dissection or ruptured valve structures or sinuses of Valsalva, are 
not delineated and are covered elsewhere.) CNS, central nervous system; IABP, intraaortic balloon pump; VAD, ventricular assist device.

a  combined  incidence  of  cardiovascular  deaths,  HF  hospitalizations, 
myocardial  infarction,  strokes,  or  sudden  death  reaching  50%  at 
12  months  after  hospitalization.  The  management  of  these  patients 
remains difficult and principally revolves around volume control and 
hemodynamic optimization to maximize end-organ perfusion.

The  first  principle  of  management  in  ADHF  is  to  identify  and 
address  the  factors  that  precipitated  decompensation.  Important  his-
torical  factors  to  consider  are  nonadherence  to  medications,  dietary 
salt indiscretion, and usage of medications (including over-the-counter 
preparations)  that  may  exacerbate  HF,  including  nonsteroidal  anti- 
inflammatory drugs, thiazolidinediones, tumor necrosis factor inhib-
itors, selected antidepressants, selected cancer therapies, cold and flu 
preparations  with  cardiac  stimulants,  and  some  herbal  preparations. 
Coronary ischemia frequently drives HF exacerbation in patients with 
atherosclerotic  cardiovascular  disease  and  should  be  systematically 
investigated (either invasively or noninvasively) in all patients at risk 
to  identify  candidates  for  revascularization.  Atrial  and  ventricular 
arrhythmias  are  common  contributors  to  HF  exacerbation  and  may 
trigger  the  need  for  antiarrhythmic  drug  suppression,  cardioversion, 
or catheter ablation. Valvular heart disease is increasingly recognized 
as a target for therapy in patients with recurrent HF exacerbations and 
can be readily identified through echocardiography. Systemic infection 
and pulmonary thromboembolism are additional triggers of HF dec-
ompensation and should be routinely considered.

Concurrent  with  the  identification  of  HF  precipitants,  effective 
management  of  ADHF  requires  pharmacologic  therapy  directed  at 
hemodynamic optimization, including relief of congestion, reduction 
in  afterload,  and  maximization  of  vital  organ  perfusion.  The  routine 
use  of  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter  is  not  recommended  and  should 
be restricted to those who present with features typical of low-output 

HF or cardiogenic shock who may require vasopressor or mechanical 
circulatory  support,  those  who  are  resistant  or  refractory  to  diuretic 
therapy,  those  with  combined  cardiorenal  dysfunction  in  whom 
therapeutic goals are difficult to define at the bedside, and those with 
known or suspected pulmonary arterial hypertension in whom vaso-
dilator  therapy  may  be  appropriate.  Analysis  of  in-hospital  registries 
has  identified  several  parameters  associated  with  worse  outcomes:  a 
blood urea nitrogen level >43 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply 
by 0.357), systolic blood pressure <115 mmHg, a serum creatinine level 
>2.75 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4), and elevated car-
diac biomarkers including natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins. 
A useful clinical schema to identify treatment targets for the various 
phenotypic presentations and management goals in ADHF is depicted 
in Fig. 258-2.

 ■ VOLUME MANAGEMENT
Intravenous  Diuretic  Agents 
Intravenous  loop  diuretic  agents 
rapidly and effectively relieve symptoms of congestion and are essential 
when oral drug absorption is impaired. When high doses of diuretic 
agents are required or when the effect of bolus dosing is suboptimal, 
a continuous infusion may be needed to reduce toxicity and maintain 
stable  serum  drug  levels.  Randomized  clinical  trials  of  high-  versus 
low-dose and bolus versus continuous infusion diuresis have not pro-
vided clear justification for the best diuretic strategy in ADHF, and as 
such, the use of diuretic regimens remains an art rather than science. 
For  those  refractory  to  loop  diuretic  treatment  alone,  addition  of  a 
thiazide diuretic agent such as chlorothiazide or metolazone to provide 
sequential  nephron  blockade  may  enhance  natriuresis  and  facilitate 
decongestion,  but  also  increases  the  risk  of  significant  hypokalemia.

1944 Change in weight is often used as a surrogate for adequate diuresis, but 
this objective measure of volume status may be surprisingly difficult to 
interpret, and weight loss during hospitalization does not necessarily 
correlate  closely  with  outcomes.  Effective  decongestion  may  also  be 
confirmed by improvement in clinical symptoms as well as the bedside 
examination  documenting  normalization  of  the  jugular  venous  pres-
sure, clearance of pulmonary rales, suppression of cardiac gallops, and 
resolution of peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and abdominal ascites. 
It is generally advisable to continue diuresis until euvolemia has been 
achieved,  since  residual  congestion  or  volume  overload  is  strongly 
associated with risk for recurrent decompensation. Predischarge mea-
surement of natriuretic peptide levels, which are highly correlated with 
risk for postdischarge mortality and readmission, may also be useful in 
assessing the adequacy of therapy and stratifying risk.

The Cardiorenal Syndrome  The cardiorenal syndrome is being 
recognized  increasingly  as  a  complication  of  ADHF.  Multiple  defini-
tions have been proposed for the cardiorenal syndrome, but at its sim-
plest, it can be thought to reflect the interplay between abnormalities 
of heart and kidney function, with deteriorating function of one organ 
while  therapy  is  administered  to  preserve  the  other.  Approximately 
30% of patients hospitalized with ADHF exhibit abnormal renal func-
tion at baseline, and this is associated with longer hospitalizations and 
increased  mortality.  However,  mechanistic  studies  have  been  largely 
unable  to  find  correlation  between  deterioration  in  renal  function, 
cardiac output, left-sided filling pressures, and reduced renal perfusion; 
most patients with cardiorenal syndrome demonstrate a preserved car-
diac output. It is hypothesized that in patients with established HF, this 
syndrome  represents  a  complex  interplay  of  neurohormonal  factors, 
potentially exacerbated by “backward failure” resulting from increased 
intraabdominal  pressure  and  impairment  in  return  of  renal  venous 
blood flow. Continued use of diuretic therapy may be associated with 
a reduction in glomerular filtration rate and a worsening of the cardi-
orenal syndrome when right-sided filling pressures remain elevated. In 
patients in the late stages of disease characterized by profound low car-
diac output state, inotropic therapy or mechanical circulatory support 
has been shown to preserve or improve renal function in selected indi-
viduals in the short term until more definitive therapy such as assisted 
circulation or cardiac transplantation is implemented.

Ultrafiltration  Ultrafiltration  (UF)  is  an  invasive  fluid  removal 
technique that may supplement the need for diuretic therapy. Proposed 
benefits of UF include controlled rates of fluid removal, neutral effects 
on  serum  electrolytes,  and  decreased  neurohormonal  activity.  This 
technique has also been referred to as aquapheresis in recognition of 
its electrolyte depletion–sparing effects. In an initial study evaluating 
UF  versus  conventional  therapy,  fluid  removal  was  improved  and 
subsequent HF hospitalizations and urgent clinic visits were reduced 
with UF; however, no improvement in renal function and no subjec-
tive differences in dyspnea scores or adverse outcomes were noted. In 
the Cardiorenal Rescue Study in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure 
(CARRESS-HF)  trial,  188  patients  with  ADHF  and  worsening  renal 
failure  were  randomized  to  stepped  pharmacologic  care  or  UF.  The 
primary  endpoint  was  a  change  in  serum  creatinine  and  change  in 
weight (reflecting fluid removal) at 96 h. Although similar weight loss 
occurred in both groups (~5.5 kg), there was a rise in serum creatinine 
among patients allocated to the UF group. Deaths and hospitalizations 
for HF were no different between groups, but there were more adverse 
events in the UF group, mainly due to kidney failure, bleeding compli-
cations,  and  intravenous  catheter-related  complications.  This  investi-
gation argues against using UF as a primary strategy in patients with 
ADHF who are diuretic-responsive. Whether UF is useful as a rescue 
strategy  in  diuretic  refractory  patients  with  advanced  renal  disease 
remains an open question, and this strategy continues to be employed 
judiciously in such situations.
 ■ VASOACTIVE THERAPY
Vasodilators  including  intravenous  nitroglycerin,  sodium  nitroprus-
side, and nesiritide (a recombinant brain-type natriuretic peptide) are 
frequently  used  in  ADHF  to  lower  intracardiac  filling  pressures  and 

reduce systemic vascular tone. Rapid reduction in ventricular preload 
and afterload with these therapies may be effective in providing symp-
tom  relief  in  patients  with  pulmonary  edema  and  in  restoring  end- 
organ perfusion for those with low cardiac output and high systemic 
vascular resistance. Nitroglycerine principally impacts venous tone and 
ventricular preload, whereas sodium nitroprusside is a potent arterial 
and venous vasodilator with more comprehensive effects on both pre-
load and afterload. While intravenous nitroglycerine is commonly uti-
lized as an adjunct to diuretics for acute management of symptomatic 
HF and pulmonary edema, nitroprusside is typically reserved for use 
in those with adequate arterial pressure or hemodynamic monitoring 
due to the risk for hypotension. The hemodynamic effects of nesiritide 
are  intermediate  between  those  of  nitroglycerine  and  nitroprusside, 
with  head-to-head  comparisons  with  nitroglycerine  suggesting  more 
rapid reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary 
vascular resistance. Clinical utilization of nesiritide has waned due to 
concerns raised regarding heightened risks of renal insufficiency and 
mortality identified in early trials. The Acute Study of Clinical Effec-
tiveness of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure (ASCEND-HF) 
study randomizing 7141 patients with ADHF to nesiritide or placebo 
did not confirm this risk, but also identified no clear clinical benefit 
with regard to subsequent HF admissions, mortality, or symptom relief 
(reduction in dyspnea). Renal function did not worsen, but increased 
rates of hypotension were noted. A smaller study of low-dose nesiritide 
in  acute  HF  (Renal  Optimization  Strategies  Evaluation  Acute  Heart 
Failure Study [ROSE-AHF]) also showed no incremental benefit over 
intravenous diuretics for relief of congestion or preservation of renal 
function. Despite apparent safety in ADHF, the routine use of nesiritide 
is accordingly not recommended.

Other  novel  vasodilators  have  been  explored  for  the  management 
of  ADHF.  Recombinant  human  relaxin-2,  or  serelaxin,  is  a  vaso-
dilatory  hormone  known  to  contribute  to  cardiovascular  and  renal 
adaptations  during  pregnancy.  In  the  Relaxin  in  Acute  Heart  Failure 
(RELAX-AHF) trial, 1161 patients hospitalized with ADHF, evidence 
of congestion, and systolic pressure >125 mmHg were randomized to 
treatment with serelaxin or placebo in addition to standard HF therapy. 
Serelaxin improved dyspnea, reduced signs and symptoms of conges-
tion, and was associated with less early worsening of HF. A positive sig-
nal of reduced mortality identified in an exploratory analysis prompted 
a second study (RELAX-AHF2), which did not confirm an effect on 
cardiovascular death or worsening HF. Accordingly, this agent was not 
approved for use in clinical practice.

One  hypothesis  for  the  failure  of  vasodilator  therapies  to  improve 
clinical  outcomes  in  ADHF  despite  favorable  hemodynamic  effects 
is  related  to  the  acute  injury  hypothesis;  in  this  model,  acute  HF  is 
analogized to presentation with an acute coronary syndrome, with the 
initial hours of presentation representing a period of vulnerability to 
myocardial  damage  (reflected  in  a  rise  in  markers  of  myocyte  injury 
such as cardiac troponins) as a consequence of abrupt increases in ven-
tricular wall stress related to acute plasma volume expansion. To test 
this hypothesis, the Trial of Ularitide Safety and Efficacy in Acute Heart 
Failure (TRUE-AHF) randomly allocated 2157 patients with acute HF 
to  early  treatment  with  the  synthetic  natriuretic  peptide  ularitide  (at 
a dose sufficient to reduce ventricular wall stress) or placebo. Despite 
a  very  short  duration  between  initial  clinical  presentation  and  phar-
macologic  intervention  (<6  h)  and  early  hemodynamic  benefits,  no 
improvement in clinical outcomes was observed in patients allocated 
to  ularitide  at  6  months.  Ularitide  was  associated  with  a  higher  rate 
of  hypotension  and  worsening  serum  creatinine.  These  data  under-
mine the notion that acute myocardial damage related to ventricular 
distension associated with HF exacerbation drives subsequent clinical 
outcomes and argue against the clinical importance of early vasodilator 
therapy in ADHF.

 ■ INOTROPIC THERAPY
Impairment  of  myocardial  contractility  often  accompanies  ADHF, 
and  pharmacologic  agents  that  increase  intracellular  concentration 
of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  via  direct  or  indirect  path-
ways, such as sympathomimetic amines (dopamine, dobutamine) and

phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitors (milrinone), respectively, serve as positive 
inotropic agents. Their activity leads to an increase in cytoplasmic cal-
cium. Inotropic therapy in those with a low-output state augments car-
diac output, reduces systemic vascular resistance, improves perfusion, 
and  relieves  congestion  acutely.  Although  systematic  head-to-head 
comparisons  are  available  to  identify  a  “best”  agent,  slight  variations 
in  the  hemodynamic  effects  of  inotropic  drugs  may  condition  selec-
tion  of  the  appropriate  drug  for  a  given  clinical  context.  Dopamine 
exhibits dose-dependent effects on dopaminergic, α-, and β-adrenergic  
receptors,  with  vasodilatory  effects  predominating  at  lower  doses  
(<2 μg/kg per min), β-adrenergic (inotropic) effects at moderate doses, 
and  α-adrenergic  effects  (vasoconstriction)  at  higher  doses  (typically  
>10  μg/kg  per  min).  Low-dose  (“renal  dose”)  dopamine  has  been 
explored  as  an  adjunctive  strategy  for  preservation  of  renal  function 
and  augmentation  of  diuresis  in  acute  HF  but  does  not  appear  to 
provide incremental advantage over routine therapy with intravenous 
diuretics (ROSE-AHF).

Milrinone is typically associated with a greater reduction in systemic 
and pulmonary vascular resistance than dobutamine and, accordingly, 
carries a higher risk of systemic hypotension. Moreover, because mil-
rinone  has  a  longer  half-life  and  is  renally  excreted,  it  requires  dose 
adjustments  in  the  setting  of  kidney  dysfunction.  Because  milrinone 
acts  downstream  from  the  β1-adrenergic  receptor,  it  may  provide  an 
advantage  in  patients  receiving  beta  blockers  when  admitted  to  the 
hospital.

Long-term  inotropic  therapy  is  associated  with  a  heightened  risk 
of  mortality  in  HF,  perhaps  due  to  the  increased  risk  of  arrhythmia 
and  sudden  death.  Routine,  short-term  use  of  milrinone  in  patients 
hospitalized  with  ADHF  in  the  Outcomes  of  a  Prospective  Trial  of 
Intravenous  Milrinone  for  Exacerbations  of  Chronic  Heart  Failure 
(OPTIME-CHF)  trial  was  associated  with  increased  risk  of  atrial 
arrhythmias  and  prolonged  hypotension,  but  no  benefit  with  regard 
to  subsequent  mortality  or  HF  hospitalization.  Accordingly,  routine 
use of inotropic support in ADHF is discouraged, and these agents are 
currently indicated principally for short-term use as bridge therapy (to 
either left ventricular assist device support or to transplant) in cardio-
genic shock or as selectively applied palliation in end-stage HF.

Novel  inotropic  agents  that  leverage  the  concept  of  myofilament 
calcium  sensitization  rather  than  increasing  intracellular  calcium 
levels have been introduced. Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer that 
provides  inotropic  activity  but  also  possesses  phosphodiesterase-3 
inhibition  properties  that  are  vasodilatory.  Two  trials,  the  second 
Randomized  Multicenter  Evaluation  of  Intravenous  Levosimendan 
Efficacy (REVIVE II) and Survival of Patients with Acute Heart Failure 
in  Need  of  Intravenous  Inotropic  Support  (SURVIVE),  have  tested 
this agent in ADHF. SURVIVE compared levosimendan with dobuta-
mine, and despite an initial reduction in circulating B-type natriuretic 
peptide  levels  in  the  levosimendan  group  compared  with  patients  in 
the dobutamine group, this drug did not reduce all-cause mortality at 
180  days  or  affect  any  secondary  clinical  outcomes.  The  second  trial 
compared levosimendan against traditional noninotropic therapy and 
found a modest improvement in symptoms with worsened short-term 
mortality  and  ventricular  arrhythmias.  Although  levosimendan  has 
been approved for use to support management of HF in several coun-
tries worldwide, it is not approved for use in the United States, largely 
owing to the lack of compelling data for incremental efficacy in com-
parison with conventional inotropic drugs or standard HF therapies.

(Table  258-1  depicts  typical  inotropic,  vasodilator,  and  diuretic 

drugs used in ADHF.)

 ■ OTHER THERAPIES FOR ADHF
Other trials testing unique agents have yielded disappointing results in 
the situation of ADHF. Adenosine has been implicated as a mediator 
of  worsening  renal  function  and  diuretic  resistance,  and  accordingly, 
treatment  with  adenosine  receptor  antagonists  was  postulated  to  be 
potentially  beneficial  in  relieving  symptoms  and  preserving  renal 
function  in  patients  with  acute  HF.  Among  patients  with  acute  HF 
and renal dysfunction enrolled in the Placebo-Controlled Randomized 
Study of the Selective A1 Adenosine Receptor Antagonist Rolofylline 

for  Patients  Hospitalized  with  Acute  Decompensated  Heart  Failure 
and Volume Overload to Assess Treatment Effect on Congestion and 
Renal  Function  (PROTECT)  trial,  no  cardiovascular  or  renal  benefit 
was observed. Similarly, despite compelling theoretical benefit of vaso-
pressin receptor antagonism in acute HF (based on the central role of 
vasopressin in mediating the fluid retention that contributes to wors-
ening  HF),  no  benefit  of  the  oral  selective  vasopressin-2  antagonist 
tolvaptan was seen with regard to mortality or HF-associated morbidity 
in the Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome 
Study with Tolvaptan (EVEREST) trial.

 ■ CLINICAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES
In the absence of data to support specific pharmacologic interventions 
in ADHF, management is largely goal-directed and focused on decon-
gestion to relieve symptoms, investigation and suppression of triggers 
for  recurrent  decompensation,  and  careful  transition  to  longitudinal 
HF management. Patients who fail to respond adequately to medical 
therapy  or  who  develop  hemodynamic  instability  may  benefit  from 
pulmonary  artery  catheter  placement  to  guide  titration  of  vasoactive 
therapy  or  inotropic  support;  in  those  with  hemodynamics  sugges-
tive  of  cardiogenic  shock,  mechanical  assist  devices  may  be  required 
(Chap.  260).  Following  stabilization,  all  patients  should  receive  edu-
cation  regarding  HF  self-management  prior  to  discharge,  including 
guidance  regarding  diet  and  lifestyle  modification,  identification  of 
worsening HF symptoms, and whom to contact in the event of clinical 
deterioration. Early postdischarge follow-up of patients following hos-
pitalization for management of worsening HF is associated with lower 
rates  of  hospital  readmission.  For  patients  with  HFrEF  hospitalized 
with  ADHF,  data  suggest  that  institution  of  appropriate  guideline-
directed medical therapy prior to hospital discharge is associated with 
higher rates of adherence to appropriate pharmacologic treatment in 
longitudinal follow-up and may be associated with improved outcomes 
in the early postdischarge interval. Most recently, in the Comparison of  
Sacubitril-Valsartan Versus Enalapril on Effect on NT-proBNP in Patients 
Stabilized from an Acute Heart Failure Episode (PIONEER-HF) study of 
patients  with  HFrEF  stabilized  after  hospital  admission  for  ADHF,  pre-
discharge  initiation  of  sacubitril-valsartan  compared  with  enalapril  was 
associated with greater reductions in natriuretic peptides as well as lower 
rates of composite death and HF readmission at 8 weeks.

HEART FAILURE WITH REDUCED 
EJECTION FRACTION
The past 50 years have witnessed great strides in the management of 
HFrEF.  Treatment  of  symptomatic  HF  has  evolved  from  a  renocen-
tric  (diuretics)  and  hemodynamic  therapy  model  (digoxin,  inotropic 
therapy) to an era of disease-modifying therapy with neurohormonal 
antagonism.  In  this  regard,  RAAS  blockers,  beta-adrenergic  receptor 
blockers,  and  most  recently,  SGLT2  inhibitors,  form  the  pillars  of 
pharmacotherapy  and  facilitate  stabilization  and  even  improvement 
in cardiac structure and function with consequent reduction in symp-
toms, improvement in QOL, decreased burden of hospitalizations, and 
a decline in mortality from both pump failure and arrhythmic deaths 
(Fig. 258-3).

 ■ NEUROHORMONAL ANTAGONISM
Meta-analyses suggest a 23% reduction in mortality and a 35% reduc-
tion  in  the  combined  endpoint  of  mortality  and  hospitalizations  for 
HF in patients with symptomatic HFrEF treated with ACE inhibitors 
(ACEIs).  Addition  of  β-adrenergic  receptor  blockers  to  background 
therapy  with  ACEIs  provides  a  further  35%  reduction  in  mortality. 
Although placebo-controlled studies are lacking, a number of nonin-
feriority  trials  have  demonstrated  comparable  efficacy  of  ARBs  and 
ACEIs in patients with HFrEF, making ARBs a suitable alternative for 
patients  who  are  intolerant  to  ACEIs  due  to  cough  or  angioedema. 
Abundant  data  support  the  efficacy  across  the  full  spectrum  of  HF 
severity (including those with NYHA class III–IV functional capacity), 
as well as the safety data of these agents. These observations demon-
strate  the  basis  for  the  tolerability  of  these  agents  even  in  subgroups 
at  higher  risk  for  adverse  effects  such  as  those  with  mild-moderate

chronic  kidney  disease.  In  diabetes  mellitus  and  chronic  obstructive 
lung disease, these agents have been established as foundational ther-
apy  for  HFrEF  as  directed  by  consensus  guidelines.  Both  agents  are 
generally  recommended  for  all  patients  with  HFrEF,  independent  of 
symptom burden, and should be titrated to the doses proven to provide 
clinical  benefit  or  to  the  maximally  tolerated  dose.  The  inability  to 
tolerate initiation or dose titration of neurohumoral antagonists due to 
hypotension, worsening HF, or progressive renal insufficiency is a poor 
prognostic marker and may be a cardinal manifestation of transition to 
an advanced HF phenotype.

Class  Effect  and  Sequence  of  Administration  ACEIs  and 
ARBs  exert  their  beneficial  effects  in  HFrEF  as  a  class;  however,  the 
beneficial effects of beta blockers are thought to be limited to specific 
drugs. Beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (xamo-
terol) and other agents, including bucindolol, have not demonstrated 
a survival benefit. On the basis of the available data, beta blocker use 
in  HFrEF  should  ideally  be  restricted  to  carvedilol,  bisoprolol,  and 
metoprolol succinate—agents tested and proven to improve survival in 
clinical trials. Whether beta blockers or ACEIs should be started first 
was  answered  by  the  Cardiac  Insufficiency  Bisoprolol  Study  (CIBIS) 
III,  in  which  outcomes  did  not  vary  based  on  the  sequence  of  drug 
initiation. Thus, it matters little which agent is initiated first; what does 
matter is that optimally titrated doses of both ACEIs and beta blockers 
be established in a timely manner.

Dose  and  Outcome 
In  general,  the  benefits  of  neurohumoral 
antagonists in HFrEF are closely related to the dose achieved, girding 
the rationale for aggressive titration to target doses as defined by clin-
ical trials. Prospective trials of high- versus low-dose ACEIs (ATLAS), 
ARBs  (HEAAL),  and  beta  blockers  (MOCHA)  consistently  favor  the 
higher  dose,  with  lower  rates  of  death  and  HF  hospitalization  seen 
in  the  higher-dose  group.  Clinical  experience  suggests  that,  in  the 
absence  of  symptoms  to  suggest  hypotension  (fatigue  and  dizziness), 
pharmacotherapy  may  be  uptitrated  every  2  weeks  in  stable  ambu-
latory  patients  as  tolerated.  Notably,  data  from  large  registries  in  the 
United  States  and  Europe  suggest  that  guideline-directed  medical 
therapy for patients with HFrEF is frequently underutilized and under-
dosed, leaving considerable room for quality improvement.

 ■ MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS
Addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to treatment with 
ACEI/ARBs  and  beta  blockers  in  patients  with  symptomatic  HFrEF 
(NYHA class II–IV) is associated with further reductions in morbidity 
and mortality. Elevated aldosterone levels in HFrEF promote sodium 
retention, electrolyte imbalance, and endothelial dysfunction and may 
directly contribute to myocardial fibrosis. Hyperkalemia and worsen-
ing renal function are concerns, especially in patients with underlying 
chronic kidney disease, and renal function and serum potassium levels 
must  be  closely  monitored.  Spironolactone  is  the  most  commonly 
utilized agent in this class based on efficacy demonstrated in the Ran-
domized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) in patients with HFrEF 
and NYHA class III–IV symptoms. Eplerenone (studied principally in 
patients with milder NYHA class II symptoms and those with HF or 
left ventricular dysfunction complication myocardial infarction) lacks 
the antiandrogen effects of spironolactone and may be a suitable alter-
native for patients who experience sexual side effects (gynecomastia, 
erectile dysfunction, diminished libido).

 ■ RAAS THERAPY AND NEUROHORMONAL 
“ESCAPE”
Since angiotensin II can be generated by non-ACE pathways, levels of 
angiotensin  II  may  recover  to  pretreatment  levels  during  long-term 
ACEI  therapy.  This  phenomenon  of  neurohormonal  “escape”  has 
fueled  interest  in  dual  blockade  of  the  RAAS  using  ACEI  and  ARBs 
in combination. In both the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) 
and  the  Candesartan  in  Heart  Failure  Assessment  of  Reduction  in 
Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM-Added) trial, addition of an ARB 
to an ACEI and other HF therapy was associated with a lower risk of 
HF  hospitalizations.  Since  neither  trial  mandated  an  evidence-based 

dose of an ACEI, however, it remained unclear whether combination 
therapy was clearly superior to a strategy of maximizing a single agent 
through  dose  titration.  Subsequent  data  from  the  Valsartan  in  Acute 
Myocardial Infarction (VALIANT) trial suggested that the addition of 
the ARB valsartan to an evidence-based dose of the ACEI captopril in 
patients  with  HF  complicating  myocardial  infarction  was  associated 
with an increase in adverse events without any added benefit compared 
with monotherapy for either group. The findings of the VALIANT trial 
are buttressed by more recent data from the Aliskiren Trial to Minimize 
Outcomes in Patients with Heart Failure (ATMOSPHERE), which ran-
domly allocated 7016 patients with HFrEF to treatment with enalapril 
(targeted dose 10 mg twice daily as recommended by guidelines), the 
plasma renin inhibitor aliskiren, or the combination on top of standard 
HF  therapy.  In  that  study,  combination  treatment  with  aliskiren  and 
enalapril  was  associated  with  higher  rates  of  hyperkalemia,  hypoten-
sion,  and  worsening  renal  function,  but  no  incremental  benefit  with 
regard  to  HF  hospitalization  or  cardiovascular  mortality.  Together, 
these  data  argue  for  a  ceiling  of  benefit  of  angiotensin  inhibition  in 
HFrEF,  beyond  which  further  inhibition  brings  more  adverse  effects 
without additional efficacy. Guidelines discourage the combination of 
an ACEI, ARB, and spironolactone in HFrEF due to the risks of hyper-
kalemia and renal dysfunction, and for most patients, treatment with 
either an ACEI or ARB and spironolactone is appropriate.

 ■ ALTERNATIVE VASODILATORS
The  combination  of  hydralazine  and  nitrates  has  been  demonstrated 
to improve survival in HFrEF. Hydralazine reduces systemic vascular 
resistance  and  induces  arterial  vasodilatation  by  affecting  intracellu-
lar  calcium  kinetics;  nitrates  are  transformed  in  smooth  muscle  cells 
into  NO,  which  stimulates  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate  produc-
tion  and  consequent  arterial-venous  vasodilation.  This  combination 
improves  survival  but  to  a  lesser  extent  than  ACEIs.  However,  in 
individuals  with  HFrEF  unable  to  tolerate  RAAS-based  therapy  for 
reasons such as renal insufficiency or hyperkalemia, this combination 
is  preferred  as  a  disease-modifying  approach.  A  trial  conducted  in 
self-identified  African  Americans,  the  African-American  Heart  Fail-
ure  Trial  (A-HeFT),  studied  a  fixed  dose  of  isosorbide  dinitrate  with 
hydralazine in patients with advanced symptoms of HFrEF who were 
receiving  standard  background  therapy  including  an  ACEI  and  beta 
blocker. The study demonstrated improvements in survival and hospi-
tal admission for HF in the treatment group. Adherence to this regimen 
is limited by the thrice-daily dosing schedule.

 ■ NOVEL NEUROHORMONAL ANTAGONISTS
Despite an abundance of animal and clinical data demonstrating dele-
terious effects of activated neurohormonal pathways beyond the RAAS 
and  sympathetic  nervous  system,  targeting  such  pathways  with  incre-
mental blockade has been largely unsuccessful. As an example, the endo-
thelin  antagonist  bosentan  is  associated  with  worsening  HF  in  HFrEF 
despite  demonstrating  benefits  in  right-sided  HF  due  to  pulmonary 
arterial hypertension. Similarly, the centrally acting sympatholytic agent 
moxonidine  worsens  outcomes  in  left  HF.  The  combined  drug  oma-
patrilat  hybridizes  an  ACEI  with  a  neutral  endopeptidase  (neprilysin) 
inhibitor, and this agent was tested in the Omapatrilat Versus Enalapril 
Randomized  Trial  of  Utility  in  Reducing  Events  (OVERTURE)  trial. 
This drug did not favorably influence the primary outcome measure of 
the combined risk of death or hospitalization for HF requiring intrave-
nous treatment compared with enalapril alone, and notably, the risk of 
angioedema was increased in patients assigned to omapatrilat.

The risk of angioedema with composite ACE/neprilysin inhibition 
appears to be related to excessive blockade of bradykinin breakdown 
by this combination. Blockade of angiotensin at the receptor level with 
an ARB leaves intact the ACE pathway for bradykinin breakdown and 
is associated with lower angioedema risk. Recently, a composite ARNI, 
sacubitril-valsartan (formerly LCZ696), was developed and applied to 
the  treatment  of  patients  with  HFrEF.  In  the  PARADIGM-HF  trial, 
8399  patients  with  HFrEF  treated  with  guideline-directed  medical 
therapy were randomly allocated to treatment with either enalapril or 
sacubitril-valsartan after a run-in period designed to ensure tolerability

of both drugs at target doses. Compared to those assigned to enalapril, 
patients  assigned  to  sacubitril-valsartan  experienced  a  dramatic  20% 
reduction in the composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death 
or HF hospitalization and a 16% reduction in all-cause mortality, as well 
as  clinically  important  improvements  in  QOL  measures.  Sacubitril- 
valsartan was well tolerated and associated with lower rates of hyper-
kalemia and worsening renal function, but greater rates of symptom-
atic hypotension, than enalapril. Guidelines now advocate a switch to 
ARNI for patients with symptomatic HFrEF who tolerate ACEIs and 
ARBs, and emerging data suggest that up-front utilization of ARNI in 
patients with de novo HF naïve to ACEIs/ARBs may also be appropri-
ate for those with adequate blood pressure to tolerate it. Given ongoing 
concern  for  angioedema,  use  of  ARNI  is  contraindicated  in  patients 
with prior history of angioedema, and those being transitioned from 
ACEIs should receive ARNI only after a 36-hour gap to limit the risk of 
overlap. Table 258-2 lists the common neurohormonal and vasodilator 
regimens for HFrEF.
 ■ HEART RATE MODIFICATION
Distinct from β-adrenergic receptor blockers, ivabradine, an inhibitor 
of  the  If  current  in  the  sinoatrial  node,  selectively  reduces  heart  rate 
without  affecting  cardiac  contractility  or  vascular  tone.  The  Systolic 
Heart Failure Treatment with Ivabradine Compared with Placebo Trial 
(SHIFT) was conducted in patients with NYHA class II or III HFrEF, prior 
HF hospitalization, sinus rhythm, and heart rate >70 beats/min. Ivabra-
dine  reduced  the  combined  endpoint  of  cardiovascular-related  death 
and HF hospitalization in proportion to the degree of heart rate reduc-
tion, which supports the notion that heart rate may be a therapeutic 
target  in  patients  with  HFrEF  in  sinus  rhythm.  Importantly,  despite 

a  protocol  requirement  for  patients  to  be  treated  with  a  maximally 
tolerated dose of a beta blocker prior to study entry, 10% of patients 
randomized  were  not  treated  with  a  beta  blocker,  and  75%  were 
treated  at  subtarget  doses.  Accordingly,  it  remains  unclear  whether  
this  agent  would  have  been  effective  in  patients  receiving  robust, 
guideline-recommended therapy for HF; however, these data do sup-
port  the  potential  value  of  ivabradine  as  an  adjunct  or  alternative  in 
those who are intolerant to initiation or dose titration of beta blockers. 
Clinical  guidelines  have  been  adapted  to  encourage  consideration  of 
ivabradine  in  patients  with  HFrEF  who  remain  symptomatic  after 
treatment with guideline-based ACEi/ARB/ARNI, beta blockers, and 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists; are in sinus rhythm; and have 
a residual heart rate >70 beats/min.
 ■ SGLT-2 INHIBITION
Inhibitors of SGLT-2 have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events 
and  mortality  among  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  at  high 
cardiovascular  risk  or  with  established  atherosclerotic  cardiovascular 
disease. A particular signal of benefit has been seen with regard to the 
incidence of HF hospitalization, which was reduced by 35% in compar-
ison  to  placebo  in  the  Empagliflozin  Cardiovascular  Outcome  Event 
Trial  in  Type  2  Diabetes  Mellitus  Patients  (EMPA-REG  OUTCOMES) 
study. Because the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition appear 
to be unrelated to the degree of reduction in hemoglobin A1c, it has been 
postulated  that  the  HF  benefits  of  this  therapy  might  be  extended  to 
patients without diabetes mellitus. Recently, the Dapagliflozin in Heart 
Failure (DAPA-HF) study randomized 4744 patients with symptomatic 
HFrEF treated with guideline-directed medical therapy (including a beta 
blocker, ACEI/ARB/ARNI, and spironolactone in >70% of patients) to

treatment with either the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin (dosage 10 mg 
daily) or placebo over a median duration of follow-up of 18.2 months. 
Patients allocated to dapagliflozin experienced a highly significant 26% 
reduction in the primary composite endpoint of worsening HF or death 
from cardiovascular causes, an effect that was consistent in both patients 
with (42%) and without diabetes mellitus at baseline. These results have 
been reinforced by the results of the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, in which 
3730 patients with symptomatic HF and ejection fraction of 40% or less 
were randomized to treatment with empagliflozin (dosage 10 mg once 
daily) or placebo in addition to recommended therapy. Over median 16 
month follow up, patients allocated to empagliflozin experienced a 25% 
reduction  in  the  primary  composite  endpoint  of  cardiovascular  death 
or hospitalization for HF, an effect that was again consistent regardless 
of the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. Together, these studies 
have driven consensus guidelines to consider use of SGLT2 inhibitors as 
foundational therapy for HF alongside ARNI, beta-blockers, and miner-
alocorticoid receptor antagonists.

 ■ SOLUBLE GUANYLYL CYCLASE STIMULATION
Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is a key enzyme of the NO signaling path-
way that catalyzes synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP), 
producing  vasodilation.  Vericiguat  is  a  novel  oral  sGC  stimulator  that 
enhances cyclic GMP and NO signaling by directly stimulating sGC and 
sensitizing sGC to endogenous NO. The Vericiguat Global Study in Sub-
jects  with  Heart  Failure  with  Reduced  Ejection  Fraction  (VICTORIA) 
randomly  assigned  5050  patients  with  chronic  HF,  NYHA  class  II–IV 
symptoms,  LVEF  <45%,  elevated  natriuretic  peptide  levels,  and  evi-
dence of worsening HF (requiring recent hospitalization or intravenous 
diuretic therapy) despite guideline-directed medical therapy to treatment 
with vericiguat (target dose 10 mg) or matching placebo over a median 
follow-up  of  11  months.  The  primary  study  results  were  notable  for  a 
modest 10% relative risk reduction in the primary composite outcome 
of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization among those assigned to 
vericiguat, an effect driven principally by effects on HF hospitalization, 
rather than cardiovascular death. As vericiguat was generally well toler-
ated with a low rate of serious adverse events, these data suggest a poten-
tial role for sGC stimulation as an adjunct to guideline-directed medical 
therapy in the high-risk group of HFrEF patients with recent congestive 
exacerbations  requiring  treatment,  although  these  data  await  further 
review by regulatory agencies and guidelines committees.

 ■ MYOSIN ACTIVATION
A novel approach to augmentation of cardiac output is to prolong ven-
tricular systole without increasing myocardial contractility. As a selec-
tive myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil prolongs the ejection period 
and increases fractional shortening without altering the force of con-
traction as a consequence. This agent, distinct from inotropic agents, 
is  not  associated  with  an  increase  in  myocardial  oxygen  demand. 
Importantly,  the  drug  is  available  for  oral,  rather  than  intravenous, 
administration, enabling chronic use in the ambulatory setting. In the 
COSMIC-HF  (Chronic  Oral  Study  of  Myosin  Activation  to  Increase 
Contractility  in  Heart  Failure)  trial  of  448  patients  with  chronic  HF 
and  left  ventricular  systolic  dysfunction,  treatment  with  omecamtiv 
mecarbil  for  20  weeks  was  associated  with  significant  improvements 
in cardiac function and indices of left ventricular remodeling, as well 
as  reductions  in  natriuretic  peptide  levels.  Notably,  the  safety  profile 
was comparable to placebo, with no increase in cardiac adverse events 
despite  a  modest  increase  in  cardiac  troponins  in  patients  allocated 
to  omecamtiv  mecarbil.  These  promising  preliminary  data  fueled  a 
larger clinical outcomes trial (GALACTIC-HF, in which 8256 patients 
with symptomatic chronic heart failure and ejection fraction of 35% or 
less were randomized to treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil (dosage 
25-50 mg twice daily based on plasma levels) or placebo in addition to 
standard HF therapy. Over median follow up of 21.8 months, patients 
allocated to omecamtiv mecarbil experienced a 14% reduction in the 
primary  composite  endpoint  of  death  from  cardiovascular  causes  or 
first heart failure event (hospitalization or urgent visit for heart failure), 
an outcome driven principally by reduction in heart failure events (no 
measureable  effect  on  CV  death  alone).  A  possible  signal  of  greater 

benefit  in  patients  with  features  of  advanced  HF  (lower  EF,  higher 
natriuretic  peptide  levels,  more  severe  symptoms)  combined  with  a 
favorable safety and tolerability profile suggests a possible role for this 
agent  in  patients  with  late-stage  disease,  though  additional  study  is 
needed.
 ■ DIGOXIN
Digitalis  glycosides  exert  a  mild  inotropic  effect,  attenuate  carotid 
sinus baroreceptor activity, and are sympatho-inhibitory. These effects 
decrease serum norepinephrine levels, plasma renin levels, and possi-
bly  aldosterone  levels.  The  Digitalis  Investigation  Group  (DIG)  trial 
demonstrated  a  reduction  in  HF  hospitalizations  in  the  treatment 
group (patients with HF and sinus rhythm) but no reduction in mor-
tality  or  improvement  in  QOL.  Importantly,  treatment  with  digoxin 
resulted  in  a  higher  mortality  rate  and  hospitalizations  in  women 
than men. It should be noted that low doses of digoxin are sufficient 
to  achieve  any  potentially  beneficial  outcomes,  and  higher  doses 
breach the therapeutic safety index. Although digoxin levels should be 
checked to minimize toxicity and although dose reductions are indi-
cated for higher levels, no adjustment is made for low levels. Generally, 
digoxin is now relegated as late-line therapy for patients who remain 
profoundly symptomatic despite optimal neurohormonal blockade and 
adequate volume control.
 ■ ORAL DIURETICS
Neurohormonal  activation  results  in  avid  salt  and  water  retention. 
Diuretic therapy is typically required in patients with symptomatic HF 
to remedy congestive symptoms as a prelude to initiation and titration 
of  neurohormonal  therapy.  Because  of  their  potent  effect  on  renal 
sodium  excretion,  loop  diuretic  agents  are  the  preferred  agents,  with 
thiazide diuretics reserved for use in combination with loop diuretics 
for those with refractory volume overload. Frequent dose adjustments 
of  loop  diuretics  may  be  necessary  during  longitudinal  follow-up  of 
patients  with  HF  because  of  variable  oral  absorption  and  fluctua-
tions in renal function. Patients who fail to respond to furosemide at 
high  doses  may  benefit  from  transition  to  torsemide  or  bumetanide, 
which have greater oral bioavailability. Importantly, clinical trial data 
confirming efficacy are limited, and no data suggest that these agents 
improve  survival.  Since  loop  diuretics  do  enhance  neurohumoral 
activation,  dosing  should  be  minimized  as  possible  to  maximize  the 
balance of risk and benefit.
 ■ CALCIUM CHANNEL ANTAGONISTS
Amlodipine  and  felodipine,  second-generation  calcium  channel–
blocking agents, safely and effectively reduce blood pressure in HFrEF 
but do not affect morbidity, mortality, or QOL. The first-generation agents, 
including verapamil and diltiazem, may exert negative inotropic effects 
and  destabilize  previously  asymptomatic  patients.  Accordingly,  their 
use should be discouraged in patients with HFrEF.
 ■ ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THERAPY
Targeting  inflammatory  cytokines  such  as  tumor  necrosis  factor  α 
(TNF-α) for the management of HF by using anticytokine agents such 
as  infliximab  and  etanercept  has  been  unsuccessful  and  associated 
with  worsening  HF.  Use  of  intravenous  immunoglobulin  therapy  in 
nonischemic  etiology  of  HF  has  not  been  shown  to  result  in  benefi-
cial  outcomes.  Nonspecific  immunomodulation  has  been  tested  in 
the Advanced Chronic Heart Failure Clinical Assessment of Immune 
Modulation  Therapy  (ACCLAIM-HF)  trial  where  ex  vivo  exposure 
of  a  blood  sample  from  systolic  HF  patients  to  controlled  oxidative 
stress  was  hypothesized  to  initiate  apoptosis  of  leukocytes  soon  after 
intramuscular gluteal injection of the treated sample. The physiologic 
response  to  apoptotic  cells  results  in  a  reduction  in  inflammatory 
cytokine production and upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. 
This  promising  hypothesis  was  not  proven,  although  certain  sub-
groups  (those  with  no  history  of  previous  myocardial  infarction  and 
those with mild HF) showed signals in favor of immunomodulation. 
Most  recently,  in  the  Canakinumab  Anti-inflammatory  Thrombosis 
Outcomes  Study  (CANTOS),  treatment  of  post–myocardial  infarc-
tion patients with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein using a

1950 monoclonal antibody targeted at interleukin 1β was associated with a 
dose-dependent reduction in hospitalization for HF and HF-associated 
mortality.  Whether  this  approach  might  have  relevance  for  patients 
with established HF remains unclear.

 ■ HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS (STATINS)
Potent  lipid-altering  and  pleiotropic  effects  of  statins  reduce  major 
cardiovascular  events  and  improve  survival  in  non-HF  populations. 
Once HF is well established, this therapy may not be as beneficial and 
theoretically could even be detrimental by depleting ubiquinone in the 
electron transport chain. Two trials, Controlled Rosuvastatin Multina-
tional  Trial  in  Heart  Failure  (CORONA)  and  Gruppo  Italiano  per  lo 
Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Insufficienza Cardiac (GISSI-HF), have 
tested low-dose rosuvastatin in patients with HFrEF and demonstrated 
no improvement in aggregate clinical outcomes. If statins are required 
to  treat  progressive  atherosclerotic  vascular  disease  or  significant 
dyslipidemia  in  the  background  setting  of  HF,  then  they  should  be 
employed.  However,  no  rationale  appears  to  exist  for  routine  statin 
therapy in nonischemic HF.
 ■ ANTICOAGULATION AND ANTIPLATELET 
THERAPY
HFrEF is accompanied by a hypercoagulable state and therefore a high 
risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke, pulmonary embolism, 
and peripheral arterial embolism. Although the value of long-term oral 
anticoagulation is established in certain groups, including patients with 
atrial fibrillation, the data are insufficient to support the use of warfarin 
in patients in normal sinus rhythm without a history of thromboem-
bolic events or echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular throm-
bus. In the large Warfarin versus Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection 
Fraction (WARCEF) trial, full-dose aspirin or international normalized 
ratio–controlled warfarin was tested with follow-up for 6 years. Among 
patients with reduced LVEF in sinus rhythm, there was no significant 
overall  difference  in  the  primary  outcome  between  treatment  with 
warfarin and treatment with aspirin. A reduced risk of ischemic stroke 
with warfarin was offset by an increased risk of major hemorrhage. A 
recent  trial  of  the  direct  oral  anticoagulant  rivaroxaban  at  low  dose 
(2.5  mg  daily)  for  patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease,  HFrEF,  and 
sinus rhythm also indicated no reduction in stroke or ischemic events 
compared with placebo. Aspirin blunts ACEI-mediated prostaglandin 
synthesis, but the clinical importance of this finding remains unclear. 
Current guidelines support the use of aspirin in patients with ischemic 
cardiomyopathy who do not have a contraindication.
 ■ FISH OIL
Treatment with long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (w-3 
PUFAs)  has  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  modestly  improved 
clinical  outcomes  in  patients  with  HFrEF.  This  observation  from  the 
GISSI-HF trial was extended to measurements of w-3 PUFAs in plasma 
phospholipids at baseline and after 3 months. Three-month treatment 
with w-3 PUFAs enriched circulating eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Low EPA levels are inversely related to 
total mortality in patients with HFrEF.
 ■ MICRONUTRIENTS
A growing body of evidence suggests an association between HF and 
micronutrient  status.  Reversible  HF  has  been  described  as  a  conse-
quence  of  severe  thiamine  and  selenium  deficiency.  Thiamine  defi-
ciency has received attention in HF due to the fact that malnutrition 
and diuretics are prime risk factors for thiamine loss. Small exploratory 
randomized studies have suggested a benefit of supplementation with 
thiamine in HFrEF with evidence of improved cardiac function. This 
finding is restricted to chronic HF states and does not appear to be ben-
eficial in the ADHF phenotype. Due to the exploratory nature of the 
evidence, no recommendations for routine supplementation or testing 
for thiamine deficiency can be made.
 ■ ENHANCED EXTERNAL COUNTERPULSATION
Peripheral  lower  extremity  therapy  using  graded  external  pneumatic 
compression  at  high  pressure  is  administered  in  1-h  sessions  for  35 

treatments (7 weeks) and has been proposed to reduce angina symp-
toms  and  extend  time  to  exercise-induced  ischemia  in  patients  with 
coronary  artery  disease.  The  Prospective  Evaluation  of  Enhanced 
External Counterpulsation in Congestive Heart Failure (PEECH) study 
assessed  the  benefits  of  enhanced  external  counterpulsation  in  the 
treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate HF. This randomized trial 
improved exercise tolerance, QOL, and NYHA functional classification 
but without an accompanying increase in peak oxygen consumption. 
A placebo effect due to the nature of the intervention simply cannot 
be excluded.

 ■ EXERCISE
The Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exer-
cise Training (HF-ACTION) study investigated short-term (3-month) 
and  long-term  (12-month)  effects  of  a  supervised  exercise  training 
program in patients with moderate HFrEF. Exercise was safe, improved 
patients’ sense of well-being, and correlated with a trend toward mor-
tality  reduction.  Maximal  changes  in  6-min  walk  distance  were  evi-
dent at 3 months with significant improvements in cardiopulmonary 
exercise time and peak oxygen consumption persisting at 12 months. 
Therefore,  exercise  training  is  recommended  as  an  adjunctive  treat-
ment in patients with HF.

 ■ MANAGEMENT OF SELECTED COMORBIDITY
Sleep-disordered  breathing  is  common  in  HF  and  particularly  in 
HFrEF.  A  range  of  presentations  exemplified  by  obstructive  sleep 
apnea,  central  sleep  apnea,  and  its  extreme  form  of  Cheyne-Stokes 
breathing are noted. Frequent periods of hypoxia and repeated micro- 
and  macro-arousals  trigger  adrenergic  surges,  which  can  worsen 
hypertension and impair systolic and diastolic function. A high index 
of suspicion is required, especially in patients with difficult-to-control 
hypertension or with predominant symptoms of fatigue despite reverse 
remodeling in response to optimal medical therapy. Worsening of right 
heart function with improvement of left ventricular function noted on 
medical  therapy  should  immediately  trigger  a  search  for  underlying 
sleep-disordered breathing or pulmonary complications such as occult 
embolism  or  pulmonary  hypertension.  Treatment  with  nocturnal 
positive airway pressure improves oxygenation, LVEF, and 6-min walk 
distance. However, no conclusive data exist to support this therapy as a 
disease-modifying approach with reduction in mortality. A recent trial 
using adaptive servo-ventilation in patients who had HFrEF and pre-
dominantly central sleep apnea increased all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality, so this approach should be avoided.

Anemia  is  common  in  HF  patients,  reduces  functional  status  and 
QOL,  and  is  associated  with  increased  proclivity  for  hospital  admis-
sions  and  mortality.  Anemia  in  HF  is  more  common  in  the  elderly, 
in  those  with  advanced  stages  of  HFrEF,  in  the  presence  of  renal 
insufficiency, and in women and African Americans. The mechanisms 
include iron deficiency, dysregulation of iron metabolism, and occult 
gastrointestinal bleeding. Intravenous iron using either iron sucrose or 
carboxymaltose  (Ferric  Carboxymaltose  Assessment  in  Patients  with 
Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure [FAIR-HF] trial) has been 
shown  to  correct  anemia  and  improve  functional  capacity.  Another 
trial,  CONFIRM-HF,  enrolled  similar  patients  with  iron  deficiency 
(ferritin <100 ng/mL or 100–300 ng/mL if transferrin saturation <20%) 
and  demonstrated  that  use  of  ferric  carboxymaltose  in  a  simplified 
high-dose  schedule  resulted  in  improvement  in  functional  capacity, 
symptoms,  and  QOL.  Oral  iron  supplementation  does  not  appear  to 
be effective in treating iron deficiency in HF. Erythropoiesis-regulating 
agents such as erythropoietin analogues have been studied with disap-
pointing results. The Reduction of Events by Darbepoetin Alfa in Heart 
Failure (RED-HF) trial demonstrated that treatment with darbepoetin 
alfa did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with systolic HF and 
may increase risk of stroke.

Depression is common in HFrEF, with a reported prevalence of one 
in five patients, and is associated with a poor QOL, limited functional 
status,  and  increased  risk  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  this  popula-
tion. However, the largest randomized study of depression in HFrEF, 
the Sertraline Against Depression and Heart Disease in Chronic Heart 

HPIM21e_Part6_p1797-p2130.indd   1950

21/01/22   6:22 PM

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular SystemFailure  (SADHART-CHF)  trial,  showed  that  although  sertraline  was 
safe, it did not provide greater reduction in depression or improve car-
diovascular status among patients with HF and depression compared 
with nurse-driven multidisciplinary management.

Atrial  arrhythmias,  especially  atrial  fibrillation,  are  common  and 
serve as a harbinger of worse prognosis in patients with HF. When rate 
control is inadequate or symptoms persist, pursuing a rhythm control 
strategy is reasonable. Rhythm control may be achieved via pharmaco-
therapy or by percutaneous or surgical techniques, and referral to prac-
titioners or centers experienced in these modalities is recommended. 
Antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be restricted to amiodarone and 
dofetilide, both of which have been shown to be safe and effective but 
do not alter the natural history of the underlying disease. The Antiar-
rhythmic  Trial  with  Dronedarone  in  Moderate-to-Severe  Congestive 
Heart Failure Evaluating Morbidity Decrease (ANDROMEDA) studied 
the effects of the novel antiarrhythmic agent dronedarone and found 
an  increased  mortality  due  to  worsening  HF.  Catheter  ablation  and 
pulmonary vein isolation appear to be safe and effective in this high-
risk cohort and compare favorably with the more established practice 
of atrioventricular node ablation and biventricular pacing.

Diabetes  mellitus  is  a  frequent  comorbidity  in  HF.  Prior  studies 
using  thiazolidinediones  (activators  of  peroxisome  proliferator- 
activated receptors) have been associated with worsening HF. Glucagon-
like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists such as liraglutide have also been tested 
and  do  not  lead  to  greater  post-hospitalization,  clinical  stability,  or 
worsening in HF. The role of SGLT-2 inhibitors in HF has been previ-
ously discussed.

 ■ NEUROMODULATION USING DEVICE THERAPY
Autonomic  dysfunction  is  common  in  HF,  and  attempts  at  using 
devices  to  modulate  the  sympathetic  and  parasympathetic  systems 
have been undertaken. Broadly, devices that achieve vagal nerve stim-
ulation,  baroreflex  activation,  renal  sympathetic  denervation,  spinal 
cord  stimulation,  or  left  cardiac  sympathetic  denervation  have  been 
employed.  While  small  preclinical  and  clinical  studies  have  demon-
strated benefits, large randomized trials, when conducted, have failed. 
The  INOVATE-HF  study  tested  vagal  nerve  stimulation  versus  opti-
mal  medical  therapy  among  individuals  with  stable  HF.  Vagus  nerve 
stimulation did not reduce the rate of death or hospitalization for HF. 
However,  functional  capacity  and  QOL  were  favorably  affected  by 
vagus nerve stimulation.

 ■ CARDIAC CONTRACTILITY MODULATION
Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is a device-based therapy for 
HF that involves nonexcitatory electrical stimulation to the right ven-
tricular septal wall during the absolute myocardial refractory period to 
augment the strength of subsequent myocardial contraction. A series 
of small, randomized, prospective clinical trials, as well as a number of 
real-world observational registries, have suggested that application of 
CCM to selected patients with HF may improve symptoms, functional 
capacity, and QOL, although no effect on hard clinical outcomes such 
as HF hospitalization or mortality has been established. The predom-
inant  benefits  of  CCM  appear  to  accrue  to  those  with  symptomatic 
HFrEF  (EF  25–45%)  and  narrow  QRS  duration  (for  whom  cardiac 
resynchronization therapy is not an option), and the approach can be 
combined  with  an  implantable  defibrillator.  The  device  is  currently 
available  for  use  in  selected  patients  with  HFrEF  outside  the  United 
States  but  is  not  currently  endorsed  by  clinical  treatment  guidelines 
in  the  United  States  or  Europe  as  part  of  the  routine  HF  treatment 
armamentarium.

CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY
Nonsynchronous  contraction  between  the  walls  of  the  left  ventricle 
(intraventricular)  or  between  the  ventricular  chambers  (interventric-
ular)  impairs  systolic  function,  decreases  mechanical  efficiency  of 
contraction, and adversely affects ventricular filling. Mechanical dys-
synchrony results in an increase in wall stress and worsens functional 
mitral regurgitation. The single most important association of extent of

dyssynchrony is a widened QRS interval on the surface electrocardio-
gram, particularly in the presence of a left bundle branch block pattern. 
With placement of a pacing lead via the coronary sinus to the lateral 
wall of the ventricle, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) enables 
a  more  synchronous  ventricular  contraction  by  aligning  the  timing 
of  activation  of  the  opposing  walls.  Early  studies  showed  improved 
exercise  capacity,  reduction  in  symptoms,  and  evidence  of  reverse 
remodeling.  The  Cardiac  Resynchronization  in  Heart  Failure  Study 
(CARE-HF) trial was the first study to demonstrate a reduction in all-
cause mortality with CRT placement in patients with HFrEF on opti-
mal therapy with continued moderate-to-severe residual symptoms of 
NYHA class III or IV HF. More recent clinical trials have demonstrated 
disease-modifying properties of CRT in even minimally symptomatic 
patients  with  HFrEF,  including  the  Resynchronization–Defibrillation 
for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) and Multicenter Automatic 
Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Ther-
apy (MADIT-CRT), both of which sought to use CRT in combination 
with an implantable defibrillator. Most benefit in mildly symptomatic 
HFrEF patients accrues from applying this therapy in those with a QRS 
width of >149 ms and a left bundle branch block pattern. Attempts to 
further  optimize  risk  stratification  and  expand  indications  for  CRT 
using  modalities  other  than  electrocardiography  have  proven  disap-
pointing.  In  particular,  echocardiographically  derived  measures  of 
dyssynchrony vary tremendously, and narrow QRS dyssynchrony has 
not proven to be a good target for treatment. Uncertainty surrounds 
the  benefits  of  CRT  in  those  with  ADHF,  a  predominant  right  bun-
dle  branch  block  pattern,  atrial  fibrillation,  and  evidence  of  scar  in 
the  lateral  wall,  which  is  the  precise  location  where  the  CRT  lead  is 
positioned.

SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH PREVENTION IN 
HEART FAILURE
Sudden  cardiac  death  (SCD)  due  to  ventricular  arrhythmias  is  the 
mode of death in approximately half of patients with HF and is par-
ticularly proportionally prevalent in HFrEF patients with early stages 
of the disease. Patients who survive an episode of SCD are considered 
to  be  at  very  high  risk  and  qualify  for  placement  of  an  implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Although primary prevention is chal-
lenging,  the  degree  of  residual  left  ventricular  dysfunction  despite 
optimal  medical  therapy  (≤35%)  to  allow  for  adequate  remodeling 
and  the  underlying  etiology  (post–myocardial  infarction  or  ischemic 
cardiomyopathy)  are  the  two  single  most  important  risk  markers  for 
stratification of need and benefit. Currently, patients with NYHA class 
II or III symptoms of HF and an LVEF <35%, irrespective of etiology 
of  HF,  are  appropriate  candidates  for  ICD  prophylactic  therapy.  In 
patients with a myocardial infarction and optimal medical therapy with 
residual LVEF ≤30% (even when asymptomatic), placement of an ICD 
is appropriate. A recent Danish trial suggested that prophylactic ICD 
implantation in patients with symptomatic systolic HF not caused by 
coronary  artery  disease  was  not  associated  with  a  significantly  lower 
long-term rate of death from any cause than was usual clinical care. In 
this trial, benefits were noted in those aged <60 years. In patients with a 
terminal illness and a predicted life span of <6 months or in those with 
NYHA class IV symptoms who are refractory to medications and who 
are not candidates for transplant, the risks of multiple ICD shocks must 
be  carefully  weighed  against  the  survival  benefits.  If  a  patient  meets 
the QRS criteria for CRT, combined CRT with ICD is often employed 
(Table 258-3).

SURGICAL THERAPY IN HEART FAILURE
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is considered in patients 
with  ischemic  cardiomyopathy  with  multivessel  coronary  artery 
disease.  The  recognition  that  hibernating  myocardium,  defined  as 
myocardial  tissue  with  abnormal  function  but  maintained  cellular 
function,  could  recover  after  revascularization  led  to  the  notion 
that  revascularization  with  CABG  would  be  useful  in  those  with 
living  myocardium.  Revascularization  is  most  robustly  supported 
in  individuals  with  ongoing  angina  and  left  ventricular  failure.

COMMENT
Sudden death in heart failure patients is generally due 
to progressive LVD, not a focal arrhythmia substrate 
(except in patients with post-MI HF)
Intervention at early stages of HF most successful 
since sudden death diminishes as cause of death with 
advanced HF
LVEF should be evaluated on optimal medical therapy 
or after revascularization before ICD therapy is 
employed; no benefit to ICD implant within 40 days of 
an MI (unless for secondary prevention)
Patients and clinicians often overestimate benefits of 
ICDs; an ICD discharge is not equivalent to an episode 
of sudden death (some ventricular arrhythmias 
terminate spontaneously); appropriate ICD discharges 
are associated with a worse near-term prognosis

Revascularizing  those  with  left  ventricular  failure  in  the  absence  of 
angina  remains  controversial.  The  Surgical  Treatment  for  Ischemic 
Heart  Failure  (STICH)  trial  in  patients  with  an  EF  of  ≤35%  and 
coronary artery disease amenable to CABG demonstrated no signifi-
cant  initial  benefit  compared  to  medical  therapy.  However,  patients 
assigned  to  CABG  had  lower  rates  of  death  from  cardiovascular 
causes and of death from any cause or hospitalization for cardiovas-
cular  causes  over  10  years  than  among  those  who  received  medical 
therapy  alone.  An  ancillary  study  of  this  trial  also  determined  that 
the detection of hibernation (viability) pre-revascularization did not 
materially  influence  the  efficacy  of  this  approach,  nor  did  it  help 
to  define  a  population  unlikely  to  benefit  if  hibernation  was  not 
detected.

Surgical  ventricular  restoration  (SVR),  a  technique  character-
ized by infarct exclusion to remodel the left ventricle by reshaping it 
surgically  in  patients  with  ischemic  cardiomyopathy  and  dominant 
anterior  left  ventricular  dysfunction,  has  been  proposed.  However, 
in a 1000-patient trial in patients with HFrEF who underwent CABG 
alone or CABG plus SVR, the addition of SVR to CABG had no dis-
ease-modifying  effect.  However,  left  ventricular  aneurysm  surgery  is 
still  advocated  in  those  with  refractory  HF,  ventricular  arrhythmias, 
or thromboembolism arising from an akinetic aneurysmal segment of 
the ventricle. Other remodeling procedures, such as use of an external 
mesh-like net attached around the heart to limit further enlargement, 
have not been shown to provide hard clinical benefits, although favor-
able cardiac remodeling was noted.

Functional (or secondary) mitral regurgitation (MR) occurs with 
varying  degrees  in  patients  with  HFrEF  and  dilated  ventricles,  and 
its  severity  is  correlated  inversely  with  prognosis.  Annular  dilatation 
and leaflet noncoaptation related to distorted papillary muscle geom-
etry in the context of ventricular remodeling is typically responsible, 
although in patients with ischemic heart disease and prior myocardial 
infarction,  leaflet  tethering  and  displacement  may  contribute.  The 
primary  approach  to  management  of  functional  MR  is  optimization 
of  guideline-directed  medical  therapy,  followed  by  CRT  in  eligible 
patients, but relief may be incomplete for many patients with advanced 
HF.  In  these  patients  with  HF  and  severe  left  ventricular  dysfunc-
tion  who  are  not  candidates  for  surgical  coronary  revascularization, 
surgical  mitral  valve  repair  (MVR)  to  remedy  functional  MR  carries 
significant risk and remains controversial. The development of percu-
taneous approaches to edge-to-edge MVR has provided a less invasive 
approach that enables reduction in functional MR at lower risk than 
conventional  surgery.  Recently,  two  large  randomized  trials  of  tran-
scatheter  MVR  using  this  approach  have  been  conducted  in  patients 
with symptomatic HFrEF and moderate-severe functional MR. In the 
Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous 

Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgita-
tion  (COAPT)  study,  patients  allocated  to  MVR  versus  standard  HF 
therapy experienced a marked reduction in both HF hospitalizations 
and mortality at 2 years, supporting the efficacy of this approach. In the 
second trial, Percutaneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe 
Functional/Secondary  Mitral  Regurgitation  (MITRA-FR),  which 
employed  a  similar  design,  the  rates  of  death  or  HF  hospitalization 
did  not  differ  between  the  percutaneous  MVR  and  medical  therapy 
groups. The precise reason for discrepant results between these studies 
remains unclear but may be related to differences in background uti-
lization of guideline-directed medical therapy, procedural success rates, 
and patient selection (particularly whether or not the severity of MR 
is  proportionate  or  disproportionate  to  the  degree  of  left  ventricular 
cavity  dilation).  Because  mortality  rates  at  2  years  remain  high  even 
with percutaneous MVR, patients with advanced symptoms of HF in 
whom MR severity is driven principally by end-stage left ventricular 
remodeling should also be considered for advanced therapies such as 
mechanical circulatory support.

CELLULAR AND GENE-BASED THERAPY
The cardiomyocyte possesses regenerative capacity, and such renewal 
is accelerated under conditions of stress and injury, such as an ische-
mic event or HF. Investigations that use either bone marrow–derived 
precursor cells or autologous cardiac-derived cells have gained traction 
but  have  not  generally  improved  clinical  outcomes  in  a  convincing 
manner. More promising, however, are cardiac-derived stem cells. Two 
preliminary pilot trials delivering cells via an intracoronary approach 
have  been  reported.  In  one,  autologous  c-kit–positive  cells  isolated 
from the atria obtained from patients undergoing CABG were cultured 
and reinfused. In another, cardiosphere-derived cells grown from end-
omyocardial  biopsy  specimens  were  used.  These  small  trials  demon-
strated improvements in left ventricular function but require far more 
work to usher in a clinical therapeutic success. Efforts to utilize mes-
enchymal stem cells to facilitate left ventricular recovery and weaning 
from  mechanical  circulatory  support  in  patients  with  left  ventricular 
assist devices have also been disappointing. The appropriate route of 
administration, the quantity of cells to achieve a minimal therapeutic 
threshold, the constitution of these cells (single source or mixed), the 
mechanism by which benefit accrues, and short- and long-term safety 
remain to be elucidated.

Targeting molecular aberrations using gene transfer therapy, mostly 
with an adenoviral vector, has been tested in HFrEF. A cellular target 
includes calcium cycling proteins such as inhibitors of phospholamban 
such as SERCA2a, which is deficient in patients with HFrEF. Primarily 
responsible for reincorporating calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticu-
lum during diastole, this target was tested in the CUPID (Efficacy and 
Safety Study of Genetically Targeted Enzyme Replacement Therapy for 
Advanced Heart Failure) trial. This study used coronary arterial infu-
sion of adeno-associated virus type 1 carrying the gene for SERCA2a 
and  initially  demonstrated  that  natriuretic  peptides  were  decreased, 
reverse  remodeling  was  noted,  and  symptomatic  improvements  were 
forthcoming. However, a confirmatory trial failed to meet its primary 
efficacy endpoint.

More advanced therapies for late-stage HF such as left ventricular 
assist  devices  and  cardiac  transplantation  are  covered  in  detail  in 
Chap. 260.

DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND  
SUPPORTIVE CARE
Despite  stellar  outcomes  with  medical  therapy,  admission  rates  fol-
lowing HF hospitalization remain high, with nearly half of all patients 
readmitted to hospital within 6 months of discharge. Recurrent HF and 
related cardiovascular conditions account for only half of readmissions 
in  patients  with  HF,  whereas  other  comorbidity-related  conditions 
account  for  the  rest.  The  key  to  achieving  enhanced  outcomes  must 
begin with the attention to transitional care at the index hospitalization 
with facilitated discharge through comprehensive discharge planning,

patient  and  caregiver  education,  appropriate  use  of  visiting  nurses, 
and  planned  follow-up.  Early  postdischarge  follow-up,  whether  by 
telephone or clinic-based, may be critical to ensuring stability because 
most HF-related readmissions tend to occur within the first 2 weeks 
after  discharge.  Although  routinely  advocated,  intensive  surveillance 
of weight and vital signs with use of telemonitoring has not decreased 
hospitalizations.  Serial  measurement  of  intrathoracic  impedance  has 
been utilized to identify early signals of worsening congestion to guide 
preemptive management to obviate the need for hospitalization. How-
ever, when systematically studied in randomized trials, this approach 
has not been proven to improve outcomes in comparison with routine 
HF care and may even enhance the rate of hospitalization due to the 
high  frequency  of  impedance  threshold  crossings  and  device  alerts. 
Implantable hemodynamic monitoring systems that directly measure 
pulmonary artery pressure tend to provide signals for early decompen-
sation,  and  in  patients  with  HF  and  moderately  advanced  symptoms 
across the full spectrum of EF, such systems have been shown to pro-
vide  information  that  can  allow  implementation  of  therapy  to  avoid 
hospitalizations by as much as 39% (in the CardioMEMS Heart Sensor 
Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class 
III  Heart  Failure  Patients  [CHAMPION]  trial).  Whether  this  reduc-
tion  in  hospital  admissions  translates  into  a  long-term  reduction  in 
mortality remains to be determined by ongoing trials (Hemodynamic 
Guided  Management  of  Heart  Failure  [GUIDE-HF];  clinicaltrials.
gov  identifier:  NCT03387813).  Alternate  approaches  to  longitudinal 
HF  monitoring  that  leverage  multiparameter  signals  derived  from 
implantable cardiac rhythm devices such as pacemakers and defibril-
lators to provide a global index of congestion are also being explored 
as adjuncts to longitudinal HF management (Multiple Cardiac Sensors 
for  the  Management  of  Heart  Failure  [MANAGE-HF];  clinicaltrials.
gov identifier: NCT03237858).

Once  HF  becomes  advanced,  regularly  scheduled  review  of  the 
disease  course  and  options  with  the  patient  and  family  is  recom-
mended,  including  discussions  surrounding  end-of-life  preferences 
when patients are comfortable in an outpatient setting. As the disease 
state  advances  further,  integrating  care  with  social  workers,  pharma-
cists,  and  community-based  nursing  may  be  critical  in  improving 
patient satisfaction with the therapy, enhancing QOL, and avoiding HF 
hospitalizations.  Equally  important  is  attention  to  seasonal  influenza 
vaccinations  and  periodic  pneumococcal  vaccines  that  may  obviate 
non-HF hospitalizations in these ill patients. When nearing end of life, 
facilitating a shift in priorities to outpatient and hospice palliation is 
key,  as  are  discussions  around  advanced  therapeutics  and  continued 
use of ICD prophylaxis, which may worsen QOL and prolong death. 
Small randomized trials have suggested that systematic integration of 
palliative care considerations in high-risk HF patients by a specialized 
team has been demonstrated to improve QOL, anxiety, depression, and 
spiritual well-being and to facilitate goal-concordant care.

GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Substantial  differences  exist  in  the  practice  of  HF  therapeutics  and 
outcomes  by  geographic  location.  The  penetrance  of  CRT  and  ICD 
is  higher  in  the  United  States  than  in  Europe.  Conversely,  therapy 
unavailable in the United States, such as levosimendan, is designated 
as  useful  in  Europe.  Variation  in  the  benefits  of  beta  blockers  based 
on world region remains an area of controversy. In oral pharmacologic 
therapy trials of HFrEF, patients from southwest Europe have a lower 
incidence  of  ischemic  cardiomyopathy  and  those  in  North  America 
tend to have more diabetes and prior coronary revascularization. There 
is also regional variation in medication use even after accounting for 
indication.  In  trials  of  HF,  disparate  effects  are  noted  across  popu-
lations.  As  a  recent  example,  in  TOPCAT,  the  drug  spironolactone 
was  effective  when  used  in  the  U.S.  population,  whereas  patients 
recruited from Russia and contiguous territories showed no difference. 

Whether  this  represents  population  differences  or  trial  conduct  dis-
parity  remains  to  be  investigated.  ADHF  patients  in  Eastern  Europe 
tend  to  be  younger,  with  higher  EFs  and  lower  natriuretic  peptide 
levels.  Patients  from  South  America  tend  to  have  the  lowest  rates  of 
comorbidities, revascularization, and device use. In contrast, patients 
from North America have the highest comorbidity burden with high 
revascularization  and  device  use  rates.  Given  geographic  differences 
in  baseline  characteristics  and  clinical  outcomes,  the  generalizability 
of therapeutic outcomes in patients in the United States and Western 
Europe may require verification.

259 Cardiomyopathy and 
Myocarditis
Neal K. Lakdawala, Lynne Warner Stevenson, 
Joseph Loscalzo

 ■ DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION
Cardiomyopathy  is  disease  of  the  heart  muscle.  It  is  estimated  that 
cardiomyopathy  accounts  for  5–10%  of  the  heart  failure  in  the 
5–6 million patients carrying that diagnosis in the United States. This 
term is intended to exclude cardiac dysfunction that results from other 
structural heart disease, such as coronary artery disease, primary valve 
disease, or severe hypertension; however, in general usage, the phrase 
ischemic  cardiomyopathy  is  sometimes  applied  to  describe  diffuse 
dysfunction  attributed  to  multivessel  coronary  artery  disease,  and 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy is used to describe cardiomyopathy from 
other  causes.  As  of  2013,  cardiomyopathies  are  defined  as  “disorders 
characterized  by  morphologically  and  functionally  abnormal  myo-
cardium in the absence of any other disease that is sufficient, by itself, 
to  cause  the  observed  phenotype.”  It  was  further  specified  that  many 
cardiomyopathies will be attributable to genetic disease.1

The  traditional  classification  of  cardiomyopathies  into  a  triad  of 
dilated,  restrictive,  and  hypertrophic  was  based  initially  on  autopsy 
specimens  and  later  on  echocardiographic  findings.  Dilated  and 
hypertrophic  cardiomyopathies  can  be  distinguished  on  the  basis  of 
left ventricular wall thickness and cavity dimension; however, restric-
tive  cardiomyopathy  can  have  variably  increased  wall  thickness  and 
chamber  dimensions  that  range  from  reduced  to  slightly  increased, 
with prominent atrial enlargement. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is now 
defined more on the basis of abnormal diastolic function, which is also 
present  but  initially  less  prominent  in  dilated  and  hypertrophic  car-
diomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy can overlap in presentation, 
gross  morphology,  and  etiology  with  both  hypertrophic  and  dilated 
cardiomyopathies (Table 259-1).

Expanding  information  renders  this  classification  triad  based  on 
phenotype increasingly inadequate to define disease or therapy. While 
dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with low left ventricular ejection 
fraction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with normal or high ejec-
tion fraction, efforts to define intermediate phenotypes based on arbi-
trary thresholds for mid-range ejection fraction are confounded by the 
increasing prevalence of patients whose low ejection has improved with 
contemporary  therapies.  Identification  of  more  genetic  determinants 
of  cardiomyopathy  has  suggested  a  four-way  classification  scheme 
of  etiology  as  primary  (affecting  primarily  the  heart)  and  secondary 
to  other  systemic  disease.  The  primary  causes  are  then  divided  into 
genetic, mixed genetic and acquired, and acquired. In practice, how-
ever, genetic information is rarely available at initial presentation, the 
phenotypic expression of a given mutation varies widely, and acquired 
cardiomyopathies  may  also  be  influenced  by  genetic  predisposition, 
which  can  be  monogenic  or  polygenic,  to  establish  a  “two-hit”  etiol-
ogy.  Identification  of  genetic  causes  of  cardiomyopathy  will  become 
increasingly  relevant  as  classification  moves  beyond  morphology  to 
identify specific molecular targets for intervention.

GENERAL PRESENTATION
The early symptoms of cardiomyopathy often reflect exertional intol-
erance with breathlessness or fatigue. As filling pressures become ele-
vated at rest, shortness of breath may occur during routine activity or 
when lying down at night. Although often considered the hallmark of 
congestion, peripheral edema may be absent despite severe fluid reten-
tion, particularly in younger patients in whom abdominal discomfort 
from hepato-splanchnic congestion and ascites may dominate. Patients 

1From E Arbustini et al: J Am Coll Cardiol 62:2046, 2013.

may also present initially with atypical chest pain, with palpitations or 
syncope related to associated rhythm disorders, or with an embolism 
from an intracardiac thrombus. Acute cardiogenic shock is the primary 
presentation for fulminant myocarditis, which can occur in otherwise 
healthy young adults and require rapid diagnosis and aggressive sup-
port, after which cardiac function may improve to near-normal levels.
The  nonspecific  term  congestive  heart  failure  describes  only  the 
resulting  syndrome  of  fluid  retention,  which  is  common  to  all  three 
structural  phenotypes  of  cardiomyopathy  and  also  to  other  cardiac 
structural diseases, such as mitral valve disease, that are associated with 
elevated  intracardiac  filling  pressures.  Initial  evaluation  begins  with 
a  detailed  clinical  history  and  examination  seeking  clues  to  cardiac, 
extracardiac,  and  genetic  causes  of  heart  disease  (Tables  259-1  and 
259-2). Echocardiography remains the initial imaging modality, with 
increasing use of MRI to provide further information on myocardial 
tissue characterization and evidence of focal and diffuse inflammation 
and abnormal interstitium.

 ■ GENETIC CAUSES OF CARDIOMYOPATHY

Estimates for the prevalence of a genetic etiology for cardiomyo-
pathy  continue  to  rise,  with  increasing  availability  of  genetic 
testing  and  attention  to  the  family  history.  Well-recognized  in 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heritability is also present in at least 30% 
of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without other clear etiology. Careful 
family history should elicit information about not only known cardio-
myopathy  and  heart  failure,  but  also  family  members  who  have  had 
sudden death, often incorrectly attributed to “a massive heart attack,” 
who have had atrial fibrillation or pacemaker implantation by middle 
age, or who have muscular dystrophy.

Most  familial  cardiomyopathies  are  inherited  in  an  autosomal 
dominant  pattern,  with  occasional  autosomal  recessive,  matrilineal 
(mitochondrial),  and  X-linked  inheritance  (Table  259-3).  Missense 
mutations  with  amino  acid  substitutions  and  truncating  variants  are 
the most common genetic abnormalities in cardiomyopathy. Expressed 
mutant  proteins  may  interfere  with  function  of  the  normal  allele 
through  a  dominant  negative  mechanism.  Mutations  introducing  a 
premature stop codon (nonsense) or shift in the reading frame (frame-
shift)  may  create  a  truncated  or  unstable  protein,  the  lack  of  which 
causes cardiomyopathy (haploinsufficiency). Deletions or duplications 
of  an  entire  exon  or  gene  are  uncommon  causes  of  cardiomyopathy, 
except for the dystrophinopathies.

Many  different  genes  have  been  implicated  in  human  cardiomyo-
pathy  (locus  heterogeneity),  and  many  mutations  within  those  genes 
have  been  associated  with  disease  (allelic  heterogeneity).  Although 
most identified mutations are “private” to individual families, several 
specific mutations are found repeatedly, either due to a founder effect 
or recurrent mutations at a common residue.

Genetic  cardiomyopathy  is  characterized  by  age-dependent  and 
incomplete penetrance. The defining phenotype of cardiomyopathy is 
rarely present at birth and, in some individuals, may never manifest. 
Related  individuals  who  carry  the  same  mutation  may  differ  in  the 
severity and rate of progression of cardiac dysfunction and associated 
rhythm  disorders,  indicating  the  important  role  of  other  genetic, 
epigenetic,  and  environmental  modifiers  in  disease  expression.  Sex 
appears  to  play  a  role,  as  penetrance  and  clinical  severity  may  be 
greater in men for most cardiomyopathies. Clinical disease expression 
is generally more severe in the ~1% of individuals who harbor two or 
more mutations linked to cardiomyopathy. However, the clinical course 
of  a  patient  usually  cannot  be  predicted  based  on  which  mutation  is 
present; thus, current therapy is based on the phenotype rather than 
the genetic defect. Currently, the greatest utility of genetic testing for 
cardiomyopathy is to inform family evaluations. However, genetic test-
ing occasionally enables the detection of a disease for which specific 
therapy is indicated, such as the replacements for defective metabolic 
enzymes in Fabry’s disease and Gaucher’s disease.

 ■ GENES AND PATHWAYS IN CARDIOMYOPATHY
Mutations  in  sarcomeric  genes,  encoding  the  thick  and  thin  myo-
filament  proteins,  are  the  best  characterized.  While  the  majority  are

associated  with  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  sarcomeric  mutations 
are  also  implicated  in  DCM,  and  some  in  left  ventricular  noncom-
paction. The most commonly recognized genetic causes of DCM are 
truncating mutations of the giant protein titin, encoded by TTN, which 
maintains sarcomere structure and acts as a key signaling molecule.

As cytoskeletal proteins play crucial roles in the structure, connec-
tion, and stability of the myocyte, multiple defects in these proteins can 
lead to cardiomyopathy, usually with a dilated phenotype (Fig. 259-1). 
For  example,  desmin  forms  intermediate  filaments  that  connect  the 
nuclear  and  plasma  membranes,  Z-lines,  and  the  intercalated  disks 
between  muscle  cells.  Desmin  mutations  impair  the  transmission  of 
force and signaling for both cardiac and skeletal muscle and may cause 
combined cardiac (restrictive > dilated) and skeletal myopathy.

Defects in the sarcolemmal membrane proteins are associated with 
DCM. The best known is dystrophin, encoded by the X chromosome 
gene  DMD,  abnormalities  of  which  cause  Duchenne’s  and  Becker’s 
muscle dystrophy. (Interestingly, abnormal dystrophin can be acquired 
when the coxsackie virus cleaves dystrophin during viral myocarditis.) 
This protein provides a network that supports the sarcolemma and also 
connects to the sarcomere. The progressive functional defect in both 
cardiac and skeletal muscle reflects vulnerability to mechanical stress. 
Dystrophin is associated at the membrane with a complex of other pro-
teins, such as metavinculin, abnormalities of which also cause DCM. 
Defects in the sarcolemmal channel proteins (channelopathies) are gen-
erally associated with primary arrhythmias, but mutations in SCN5A, 
the α subunit of the Nav 1.5 ion channel protein, distinct from those 
that cause the Brugada or long QT syndromes, have been implicated in 
DCM with conduction disease.

Nuclear  membrane  protein  defects  in  cardiac  and  skeletal  muscle 
occur in either autosomal (lamin A/C) or X-linked (emerin) patterns. 
These defects are associated with a high prevalence of atrial and ven-
tricular arrhythmias and conduction system disease, which can occur 
in some family members without or before detectable cardiomyopathy.
Intercalated  disks  contribute  to  intracellular  connections,  allowing 
mechanical and electrical coupling between cells and also connections 
to desmin filaments within the cell. Mutations in proteins of the desmo-
somal  complex  compromise  attachment  of  the  myocytes,  which  can 
become disconnected and die via activation of Wnt/β-catenin and proin-
flammatory signaling pathways, to be replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. 
These  areas  are  highly  arrhythmogenic  and  may  dilate  to  form  aneu-
rysms.  Although  more  often  noted  in  the  right  ventricle  (arrhythmo-
genic right ventricular cardiomyopathy), this condition can affect both 
ventricles and has also been termed “arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.”

As  many  signaling  pathways  are  conserved  over  multiple  systems, 
we  anticipate  discovering  extracardiac  manifestations  of  abnormal

FIGURE 259-1  Drawing of myocyte indicating multiple sites of abnormal gene products associated with cardiomyopathy. Major functional groups include the sarcomeric 
proteins  (actin,  myosin,  tropomyosin,  and  the  associated  regulatory  proteins),  the  dystrophin  complex  stabilizing  and  connecting  the  cell  membrane  to  intracellular

proteins  initially  considered  restricted  to  the  heart.  In  contrast,  the 
monogenic  disorders  of  metabolism  that  affect  the  heart  are  already 
clearly recognized to affect multiple organ systems. Currently, it is most 
important  to  diagnose  defective  enzymes  for  which  specific  therapy 
can now ameliorate the course of disease, such as with alpha-galacto-
sidase A deficiency (Fabry’s disease). Abnormalities of mitochondrial 
DNA  (maternally  transmitted)  impair  energy  production  with  mul-
tiple  clinical  manifestations,  including  impaired  cognitive  function 
and  skeletal  myopathy.  The  phenotypic  expression  is  highly  variable 
depending  on  the  distribution  of  the  maternal  mitochondria  during 
embryonic development. Heritable systemic diseases, such as familial 
amyloidosis and hemochromatosis, can affect the heart without muta-
tion of genes expressed in the heart.

For  any  patient  with  suspected  or  proven  genetic  disease,  family 
members should be considered and evaluated in a longitudinal fashion. 
Screening generally includes both an echocardiogram and electrocar-
diogram  (ECG).  The  indications  and  implications  for  confirmatory 
specific genetic testing vary depending on the specific mutation. The 
profound questions raised by families about diseases shared and passed 
down  merit  serious  and  sensitive  discussion,  ideally  provided  by  a 
trained genetic counselor.

DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
An enlarged left ventricle with reduced systolic function as measured 
by  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  characterizes  DCM  (Figs.  259-2, 
259-3,  and  259-4).  Systolic  failure  is  more  prominent  than  diastolic 

dysfunction.  Although  the  syndrome  of  DCM  has  many  disparate 
etiologies  (Table  259-4),  these  often  evolve  to  common  pathways 
of  secondary  response  and  disease  progression  (convergent  pheno-
type).  When  myocardial  injury  is  acquired,  some  myocytes  may  die 
initially,  whereas  others  survive  only  to  have  later  programmed  cell 
death  (apoptosis),  and  remaining  myocytes  hypertrophy  in  response 
to  increased  wall  stress.  Local  and  circulating  factors  stimulate  dele-
terious secondary responses that contribute to progression of disease. 
Dynamic  remodeling  of  the  interstitial  scaffolding  affects  diastolic 
function and the amount of ventricular dilation. Mitral regurgitation 
commonly develops as the valvular apparatus is distorted and is usually 
substantial by the time heart failure is severe. Many cases that present 
“acutely”  have  progressed  silently  through  these  stages  over  months 
to  years.  Dilation  and  decreased  function  of  the  right  ventricle  may 
result  directly  from  the  initial  injury,  but  more  often  develops  later 
in  response  to  elevated  afterload  presented  by  secondary  pulmonary 
hypertension and in relation to mechanical interactions with the failing 
left ventricle.

Regardless of the nature and degree of direct cell injury and loss, the 
resulting  impairment  often  reflects  secondary  responses  that  may  be 
modifiable or reversible. About a third of patients with new-onset car-
diomyopathy demonstrate substantial spontaneous recovery. Chronic 
DCM may also improve in some patients without underlying structural 
heart disease to near-normal ejection fractions during recommended 
therapy  with  neurohormonal  modulation,  cardiac  resynchroniza-
tion therapy for left bundle branch block, and diuretics as needed to

maintain fluid balance. In many patients, these therapies can stabilize 
cardiac and clinical function and extend survival (Chap. 252). Further 
aspects  of  diagnosis  and  therapy  specific  to  etiologies  of  DCM  are 
discussed below.
 ■ MYOCARDITIS
Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) is most often attributable to 
infective agents but can also arise from other causes of inflammation. 
Infectious  myocarditis  cannot  be  assumed  from  a  presentation  of 
decreased systolic function in the setting of an acute infection, as any 
severe condition causing systemic cytokine release can depress cardiac 
function transiently, as seen frequently in medical intensive care units. 
Myocardial inflammation without obvious infection is seen in sarcoi-
dosis and giant cell myocarditis, with checkpoint inhibitor therapy, in 
eosinophilic myocarditis, or in association with autoimmune diseases 
such  as  polymyositis  and  systemic  lupus  erythematosus.  Fulminant 
myocarditis can result from viral infection, checkpoint inhibitor ther-
apy,  giant  cell  myocarditis,  or  necrotizing  eosinophilic  myocarditis, 
and is often complicated by recurrent arrhythmias. Early recognition 
of fulminant myocarditis is crucial as recovery to near-normal cardiac 
function can occur during aggressive circulatory support.
 ■ INFECTIVE MYOCARDITIS
Infections can injure the myocardium through direct invasion, disrup-
tion of normal cellular processes, production of cardiotoxic substances, 
or  stimulation  of  chronic  inflammation  with  or  without  persistent 
infection.  Myocarditis  has  been  reported  with  almost  all  types  of 
infective agents but is most commonly associated with viruses and the 
protozoan  Trypanosoma  cruzi.  The  pathogenesis  of  viral  myocarditis 
has  been  extensively  studied  in  murine  models  as  divided  into  three 
phases. For the direct viral invasion phase, viruses gain entry through 
the  respiratory  or  gastrointestinal  tract  and  infect  organs  possessing 
specific  receptors,  such  as  the  coxsackie-adenovirus  receptors  on  the 
heart, which are prominent around intercalated disks and the atrioven-
tricular (AV) node. Viral infection and replication can cause myocar-
dial injury and lysis. For example, the enteroviral protease 2A degrades 
the myocyte structural protein dystrophin and interacts with other host 
proteins  to  induce  apoptosis,  inhibit  the  host  serum  response  factor, 
and interfere with autophagy of protein aggregates.

The second phase is the nonspecific (innate) host response to infec-
tion, which is heavily dependent on Toll-like receptors that recognize 
common antigenic patterns. Cytokine release is rapid, followed by trig-
gered activation and expansion of specific T- and B-cell populations. 
This initial response appears to be crucial, as early immunosuppression 
in  animal  models  can  increase  viral  replication  and  worsen  cardiac

injury. However, successful recovery from viral infection depends not 
only  on  the  efficacy  of  the  immune  response  to  limit  viral  infection, 
but  also  on  timely  downregulation  to  prevent  ongoing  autoimmune 
injury to the host.

The secondary acquired (adaptive) immune response is specifically 
addressed against the viral proteins and can include both T-cell infil-
tration  and  antibodies  to  viral  proteins.  If  unchecked,  the  acquired 
immune response can perpetuate secondary cardiac damage. Ongoing 
cytokine  release  activates  matrix  metalloproteinases  that  can  disrupt 
the collagen and elastin scaffolding of the heart, potentiating ventric-
ular  dilation.  Stimulation  of  profibrotic  factors  leads  to  pathologic 
interstitial fibrosis. Some antibodies triggered through co-stimulation 
or molecular mimicry also recognize targets within the host myocyte, 
such  as  the  β-adrenergic  receptor,  α-myosin,  and  troponin,  but  it 
remains  unclear  as  to  whether  or  not  these  antibodies  contribute  to 
cardiac dysfunction in humans or merely serve as markers of cardiac 
injury.

It  is  not  known  how  long  the  viruses  persist  in  the  human  heart, 
whether  late  persistence  of  the  viral  genome  continues  to  be  delete-
rious,  or  how  often  a  dormant  virus  can  be  reactivated.  Genomes  of 
common viruses are often present in patients with clinical diagnoses of 
myocarditis or DCM, but there is little information on how often these 
are  present  in  patients  without  cardiac  disease  (see  below).  Further 
information is needed to understand the relative timing and contribu-
tion of infection, immune responses, and secondary adaptations in the 
progression of heart failure after viral myocarditis (Fig. 259-5).
Clinical Presentation of Viral Myocarditis  Acute viral myocarditis 
often  presents  with  symptoms  and  signs  of  heart  failure,  but  may 
present with chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of pericarditis or 
acute myocardial infarction, and occasionally with atrial or ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias. The typical patient with presumed viral myocarditis 
is a young to middle-aged adult who develops progressive dyspnea and 
weakness within a few days to weeks after a viral syndrome that was 
accompanied by fever and myalgias. Subacute presentation may occur 
within a few weeks or months of a viral infection. As viral infections 
are common and the resulting cytokine activation can depress cardiac 
function, it is often difficult to determine whether viral infection caused 
myocarditis or unmasked a previously unrecognized cardiomyopathy.
A  small  number  of  patients  present  with  fulminant  myocarditis, 
with rapid progression within hours from a severe febrile respiratory 
syndrome  to  cardiogenic  shock  that  may  involve  multiple  organ  sys-
tems, leading to renal failure, hepatic failure, and coagulopathy. These 
patients are typically young adults who have recently been dismissed 
from urgent care settings with antibiotics for bronchitis, only to return 
within a few days in rapidly progressive cardiogenic shock. Recogni-
tion of patients with this fulminant presentation is potentially life-saving 
as  more  than  half  can  survive  with  aggressive  support,  which  may 
include high-dose intravenous catecholamine therapy and sometimes 
temporary mechanical circulatory support. The ejection fraction func-
tion of these patients often recovers to near-normal, although residual 
diastolic dysfunction may limit vigorous exercise for some survivors.

Chronic  viral  myocarditis  is  often  invoked,  but  rarely  proven,  as  a 
diagnosis when no other cause of DCM can be identified. Many cases 
attributed  to  previous  viral  infection  will  later  be  recognized  as  due 
to genetic causes or consumption of excess alcohol or illicit stimulant 
drugs. The proportion of chronic DCM due to viral infection remains 
a subject of controversy.
Laboratory Evaluation for Myocarditis  The  initial  evaluation 
for suspected myocarditis includes an ECG, an echocardiogram, and 
serum  levels  of  troponin  and  creatine  phosphokinase,  of  which  both 
cardiac  and  skeletal  muscle  fractions  may  be  elevated.  Magnetic  res-
onance imaging is increasingly used for the diagnosis of myocarditis, 
which  is  supported  but  not  proven  by  evidence  of  increased  tissue 
edema and gadolinium enhancement (Fig. 259-6), particularly in the 
mid-wall (as distinct from usual coronary artery territories).

Endomyocardial  biopsy  is  indicated  when  a  new  presentation  of 
heart  failure  is  accompanied  by  conduction  blocks  or  ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias,  which  suggest  possible  etiologies  of  noninfectious

inflammatory  causes  that  warrant  aggressive  immunosuppression, 
such  as  sarcoidosis  or  giant  cell  myocarditis.  The  indications,  yield, 
and benefit of endomyocardial biopsy for evaluation of myocarditis or 
new-onset  cardiomyopathy  are  not  well  established.  When  biopsy  is 
performed, the key Dallas criteria for myocarditis include lymphocytic 
infiltrate with evidence of myocyte necrosis (Fig. 259-7) and are neg-
ative in 80–90% of patients with clinical myocarditis. Negative Dallas 
criteria  can  reflect  sampling  error  or  early  resolution  of  lymphocytic 
infiltrates,  but  may  also  be  influenced  by  the  insensitivity  of  the  test 
when  inflammation  results  from  cytokines  and  antibody-mediated 
injury.  Routine  histologic  examination  of  endomyocardial  biopsy 
rarely  reveals  a  specific  infective  etiology,  such  as  toxoplasmosis  or 
cytomegalovirus subsets. Immunohistochemistry of myocardial biopsy 
samples is commonly used to identify active lymphocyte subtypes and 
may  also  detect  upregulation  of  HLA  antigens  and  the  presence  of 
complement components attributed to inflammation, but the specific-
ity and significance of these findings are uncertain.

Chronic dilated
cardiomyopathy

An 

increase 

in  circulating  viral  titers 
between acute and convalescent blood samples 
supports  a  diagnosis  of  acute  viral  myocardi-
tis  with  potential  spontaneous  improvement. 
Respiratory virus panels can detect adenovirus, 
influenza,  and  coronavirus.  There  is  no  estab-
lished role for measuring circulating anti-heart 
antibodies, which may be the result, rather than 
a cause, of myocardial injury and have also been 
found in patients with coronary artery disease 
and genetic cardiomyopathy.

Patients  with  recent  or  ongoing  viral  syn-
dromes have been classified into three levels of 
myocarditis  diagnosis.  (1)  Possible  subclinical 
acute  myocarditis  is  diagnosed  when  a  typical 
viral  syndrome  occurs  without  cardiac  symp-
toms,  but  with  elevated  biomarkers  of  cardiac 
injury,  ECG  suggestive  of  acute  injury,  and/
or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or 
regional wall motion abnormality. (2) Probable 
acute myocarditis is diagnosed when the above 
criteria  are  met  and  accompanied  by  cardiac 
symptoms, such as shortness of breath or chest 
pain,  which  can  result  from  pericarditis  or 
myocarditis.  When  clinical  findings  of  peri-
carditis are accompanied by elevated troponin 
or  CK-MB  or  abnormal  cardiac  wall  motion, 
the  terms  perimyocarditis  or  myopericarditis 
are  sometimes  used.  (3)  Definite  myocarditis 
is  diagnosed  when  there  is  histologic  or  immunohistologic  evidence 
of inflammation on endomyocardial biopsy (see below) and does not 
require  any  other  laboratory  or  clinical  criteria.  Magnetic  resonance 
imaging is increasingly employed early in the evaluation for possible 
myocarditis. With the original 2009 Lake Louise criteria for myocar-
ditis,  a  positive  study  required  any  two  of  three  findings:  abnormal 
T2-weighted  imaging  or  early  or  late  gadolinium  enhancement. 
Revised  criteria  for  specificity  require  both  a  T2-weighted  criterion 
indicating edema and one T1-based criterion consistent with inflam-
matory  injury,  although  more  liberal  diagnostic  criteria  allowing  for 
the  presence  of  either  one  yields  higher  sensitivity.  The  presence  of 
pericardial effusion supports the diagnosis of inflammation, although 
it is not specific.

 ■ SPECIFIC VIRUSES IMPLICATED IN MYOCARDITIS
In humans, viruses are rarely proven to be the direct cause of clinical 
myocarditis.  First  implicated  was  the  picornavirus  family  of  RNA 
viruses, principally the enteroviruses, coxsackie virus, echovirus, and 
poliovirus.  Influenza,  another  RNA  virus,  is  implicated  with  varying 
frequency  every  winter  and  spring  as  epitopes  change.  Of  the  DNA 
viruses,  adenovirus,  vaccinia,  and  the  herpesviruses  (varicella-zoster 
virus,  cytomegalovirus,  Epstein-Barr  virus,  and  human  herpesvirus 
6  [HHV6])  are  well  recognized  to  cause  myocarditis  but  also  occur 
commonly in the healthy population. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
detects viral genomes in the majority of patients with DCM, but also 
in normal “control” hearts. Most often detected are parvovirus B19 and 
HHV6, which may affect the cardiovascular system, in part, through 
infection of vascular endothelial cells. However, their contribution to 
chronic cardiomyopathy is uncertain, as serologic evidence of exposure 
is present in many children and most adults.

Human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  was  associated  with  an 
incidence of DCM of 1–2%. However, with the advent of highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV has been associated with a sig-
nificantly lower incidence of cardiac disease. Cardiomyopathy in HIV 
may also result from cardiac involvement with other associated viruses, 
such  as  cytomegalovirus  and  hepatitis  C.  Antiviral  drugs  to  treat 
chronic  HIV  can  cause  cardiomyopathy,  both  directly  and  through 
drug  hypersensitivity.  The  clinical  picture  may  be  complicated  by 
pericardial effusions and pulmonary hypertension. There is a high fre-
quency of lymphocytic myocarditis found at autopsy, and viral particles 
have been demonstrated in the myocardium in some cases, consistent 
with direct causation.

Hepatitis  C  has  been  repeatedly  implicated  in  cardiomyopathy, 
particularly in Germany and Asia. Cardiac dysfunction may improve 
after interferon therapy. As this cytokine itself often depresses cardiac 
function  transiently,  careful  coordination  of  its  administration  and 
ongoing clinical evaluation are critical. The cardiac effects of curative 
treatments for hepatitis C on cardiac function have not yet been well 
studied but do not appear to have limited the successful transplantation 
of hepatitis C–positive donors. Involvement of the heart with hepatitis 
B is uncommon but can be seen when associated with systemic vascu-
litis (polyarteritis nodosa).

Additional  viruses  implicated  specifically  in  myocarditis  include 
mumps,  respiratory  syncytial  virus,  the  arboviruses  (dengue  fever  and 
yellow fever), and arenaviruses (Lassa fever). For any serious infection, 
the systemic inflammatory response can cause nonspecific depression 
of cardiac function, which is generally reversible if the patient survives. 
This nonspecific inflammatory response is likely responsible for most 
of the cardiac findings with SARS-CoV-2, for which clinical informa-
tion is accumulating rapidly. There is some evidence for direct cardio-
myocyte invasion by the virus, consistent with an early model of acute 
myocarditis in rabbits caused by rabbit coronavirus. Some patients do 
present  with  ECG  changes  mimicking  acute  myocardial  infarction. 
The endothelium is also a distinct cellular target of SARS-CoV-2, and 
the resulting vasoconstrictive and prothrombotic endotheliopathy may 
contribute to myocardial ischemia (and stroke). The dominant injury 
is to the lungs, where adult respiratory distress syndrome can develop, 
particularly in older patients and those with underlying comorbidities. 
When heart failure develops later in the course, it is usually in the set-
ting of refractory respiratory failure and other organ failure from which 
survival is unlikely.

 ■ THERAPY OF VIRAL MYOCARDITIS
There  is  currently  no  specific  therapy  recommended  during  any 
stage  of  viral  myocarditis.  During  acute  infection,  therapy  with 
anti-inflammatory  or  immunosuppressive  medications  is  avoided,  as 
their use has been shown to increase viral replication and myocardial 
injury in animal models. Therapy with specific antiviral agents (such 
as  oseltamivir)  has  not  been  studied  in  specific  relation  to  cardiac 
involvement. There is ongoing investigation into the impact of antiviral 
therapy  to  treat  chronic  viral  persistence  identified  from  endomyo-
cardial  biopsy.  Large  trials  of  immunosuppressive  therapy  for  Dallas 
criteria–positive myocarditis have been negative. There are some initial 

encouraging results and ongoing investigations with immunosuppres-
sive  therapy  for  immune-mediated  myocarditis  defined  by  immuno-
histologic  criteria  on  biopsy  or  circulating  antimyocardial  antibodies 
in the absence of myocardial viral genomes. However, neither antiviral 
nor anti-inflammatory therapies are currently recommended. Until we 
have a better understanding of the phases of viral myocarditis and the 
effects of targeted therapies, treatment will continue to be guided by 
general recommendations for DCM.

 ■ OTHER INFECTIOUS CAUSES
Parasitic Myocarditis  Chagas’ disease is the third most common 
parasitic infection in the world and the most common infective cause 
of cardiomyopathy. The protozoan  T. cruzi is transmitted by the bite 
of the reduviid bug, endemic in the rural areas of South and Central 
America.  Transmission  can  also  occur  through  blood  transfusion, 
organ donation, from mother to fetus, and occasionally orally. While 
programs to eradicate the insect vector have decreased the prevalence 
from  about  16  million  to  <10  million  in  South  America,  cases  are 
increasingly  recognized  in  Western  developed  countries  (see  Global 
Perspectives below).

Multiple  pathogenic  mechanisms  are  implicated.  The  parasite 
itself can cause myocyte lysis and primary neuronal damage. Specific 
immune responses may recognize the parasites or related antigens and 
lead to chronic immune activation in the absence of detectable para-
sites. Molecular techniques have revealed persistent parasite DNA frag-
ments in infected individuals. Further evidence for persistent infection 
is  the  eruption  of  parasitic  skin  lesions  during  immunosuppression 
after  cardiac  transplantation.  As  with  viral  myocarditis,  the  relative 
roles of persistent infection and of secondary autoimmune injury have 
not been resolved (Fig. 259-5). An additional factor in the progression 
of  Chagas’  disease  is  the  autonomic  dysfunction  and  microvascular 
damage that may contribute to cardiac and gastrointestinal disease.

The  acute  phase  of  Chagas’  disease  with  parasitemia  is  usually 
unrecognized,  but  in  fewer  than  5%  of  cases,  it  presents  clinically 
within  a  few  weeks  of  infection  with  nonspecific  symptoms  or  occa-
sionally  with  acute  myocarditis  and  meningoencephalitis.  In  the 
absence of antiparasitic therapy, the silent stage progresses slowly for 
>10–30 years in almost half of patients to manifest chronically in the 
cardiac and gastrointestinal systems. Features typical of Chagas’ disease 
are conduction system abnormalities, particularly sinus node and AV 
node dysfunction and right bundle branch block. Atrial fibrillation and 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias also occur. Small ventricular aneurysms 
are common, particularly at the ventricular apex. These dilated ventri-
cles are particularly thrombogenic, giving rise to pulmonary and sys-
temic emboli. Xenodiagnosis, detection of the parasite itself, is rarely 
performed. The serologic tests for specific IgG antibodies against the 
trypanosome  lack  sufficient  specificity  and  sensitivity,  requiring  two 
separate positive tests to make a diagnosis.

Treatment of the advanced stages focuses on clinical manifestations 
of  the  disease  and  includes  heart  failure  medications,  pacemaker- 
defibrillators,  and  anticoagulation.  The  most  common  antiparasitic 
therapies are benznidazole and nifurtimox, which have been effective 
in children with chronic T. cruzi infection. Both drugs are associated 
with  multiple  severe  reactions,  including  dermatitis,  gastrointestinal 
distress, and neuropathy. Moreover, in a large trial of adults with estab-
lished Chagas’ cardiomyopathy, benznidazole did not prevent disease 
progression, leaving the role of antiparasitic therapy unclear. Survival 
is <30% at 5 years after the onset of overt clinical heart failure. Patients 
without major extracardiac disease have occasionally undergone trans-
plantation, after which they require surveillance testing and recurrent 
antiparasitic therapy to suppress reactivation of infection.

African  trypanosomiasis  infection  results  from  the  tsetse  fly  bite 
and  can  occur  in  travelers  exposed  during  trips  to  Africa.  The  West 
African  form  is  caused  by  Trypanosoma  brucei  gambiense  and  pro-
gresses silently over years. The East African form caused by T. brucei 
rhodesiense  can  progress  rapidly  through  perivascular  infiltration  to 
myocarditis and heart failure, with frequent arrhythmias. The diagno-
sis is made by identification of trypanosomes in blood, lymph nodes,

1962 or other affected sites. Antiparasitic therapy has limited efficacy and is 
determined by the specific type and the stage of infection. Toxoplasmosis 
is contracted through ingestion of undercooked infected beef or pork, 
transmission  from  feline  feces,  organ  transplantation,  transfusion,  or 
maternal-fetal  transmission.  Immunocompromised  hosts  are  most 
likely to experience reactivation of latent infection from cysts, found 
in up to 40% of autopsies of patients dying from HIV infection. Toxo-
plasmosis may present with encephalitis or chorioretinitis and, in the 
heart, can cause myocarditis, pericardial effusion, constrictive pericar-
ditis, and heart failure. The diagnosis in an immunocompetent patient 
is made when the IgM is positive and the IgG becomes positive later. 
Active  toxoplasmosis  may  be  suspected  in  an  immunocompromised 
patient with myocarditis and a positive IgG titer for toxoplasmosis, par-
ticularly when avidity testing identifies high specificity of the antibody. 
Fortuitous sampling occasionally reveals the cysts in the myocardium. 
Combination therapy can include pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine or 
clindamycin.

Trichinellosis  is  caused  by  Trichinella  spiralis  larva  ingested  with 
undercooked meat. Larvae migrating into skeletal muscles cause myal-
gias, weakness, and fever. Periorbital and facial edema, and conjuncti-
val and retinal hemorrhage may also be seen. Although the larva may 
occasionally invade the myocardium, clinical heart failure is rare and, 
when observed, attributed to the eosinophilic inflammatory response. 
The diagnosis is made from the specific serum antibody and is further 
supported  by  the  presence  of  eosinophilia.  Treatment  includes  anti-
helminthic  drugs  (albendazole,  mebendazole)  and  glucocorticoids  if 
inflammation is severe.

Cardiac involvement with echinococcus is rare, but cysts can form 

and rupture in the myocardium and pericardium.

Bacterial  Infections  Most  bacterial  infections  can  involve  the 
heart  occasionally  through  direct  invasion  and  abscess  formation, 
but  do  so  rarely.  More  commonly,  systemic  inflammatory  responses 
depress contractility in severe infection and sepsis. Diphtheria specifi-
cally affects the heart in almost one-half of cases, and cardiac involve-
ment is the most common cause of death in patients with this infection. 
The prevalence of vaccines has shifted the incidence of diphtheria from 
children worldwide to countries without routine immunization and to 
older populations who have lost their immunity. The bacillus releases 
a toxin that impairs protein synthesis and may particularly affect the 
conduction  system.  The  specific  antitoxin  should  be  administered  as 
soon as possible, with higher priority than antibiotic therapy. Clostri-
dial toxin causes myocardial damage, and gas bubbles can be detected 
in  the  myocardium,  with  occasional  abscess  formation  in  the  myo-
cardium  and  pericardium.  Streptococcal  infection  with  β-hemolytic 
streptococci is most commonly associated with acute rheumatic fever 
and is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of cardiac valves and 
systemic connective tissue, but it can also lead to a myocarditis with 
focal or diffuse infiltrates of mononuclear cells. Other systemic bacte-
rial infections that can involve the heart include brucellosis, legionella, 
meningococcus, mycoplasma, psittacosis, and salmonellosis, for which 
specific treatment is directed at the systemic infection.

Tuberculosis can involve the myocardium directly as well as through 
tuberculous pericarditis, but rarely does so when the disease is treated 
with antibiotics. Whipple’s disease is caused by Tropheryma whipplei. 
The usual manifestations are in the gastrointestinal tract, but pericar-
ditis, coronary arteritis, valvular lesions, and occasionally clinical heart 
failure may also occur. Multidrug antituberculous regimens are effec-
tive, but the disease tends to relapse even with appropriate treatment.

Tick-Borne  Infections  Spirochetal  myocarditis  has  been  diag-
nosed from myocardial biopsies containing Borrelia burgdorferi, which 
causes Lyme disease. Lyme carditis most often presents with arthritis 
and conduction system disease that resolves within 1–2 weeks of anti-
biotic treatment and is only rarely implicated in chronic heart failure. 
Other tick-borne illnesses associated with febrile illnesses and myocar-
ditis include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Q fever, and ehrlichiosis, 
all of which are treated with doxycycline alone or in combination with 
other agents.

 ■ NONINFECTIVE MYOCARDITIS
Myocardial inflammation can occur in the absence of infectious causes. 
The  paradigm  of  noninfective  inflammatory  myocarditis  is  cardiac 
transplant  rejection,  from  which  we  have  learned  that  myocardial 
depression can develop and reverse quickly, that noncellular mediators 
such as antibodies and cytokines play a major role in addition to lym-
phocytes, and that myocardial antigens are exposed by prior physical 
injury and viral infection.

The most commonly diagnosed noninfective inflammatory process 
affecting  the  myocardium  is  granulomatous  myocarditis,  including 
both  sarcoidosis  and  giant  cell  myocarditis.  Sarcoidosis,  as  discussed 
in Chap. 367, is a multisystem disease most commonly affecting the 
lungs. Although classically presenting with higher prevalence in young 
African-American men, the epidemiology appears to be changing, with 
increasing recognition of sarcoidosis in Caucasian patients in nonur-
ban areas. Patients with pulmonary sarcoid are at high risk for cardiac 
involvement, but cardiac sarcoidosis also occurs without clinical lung 
disease. Regional clustering of the disease supports the suspicion that 
the granulomatous reaction is triggered by infectious or environmental 
allergens not yet identified.

The  sites  and  density  of  cardiac  granulomata,  the  time  course, 
and  the  degree  of  extracardiac  involvement  are  remarkably  variable. 
Patients  may  present  with  rapid-onset  heart  failure  and  ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias, conduction block, chest pain syndromes, or minor 
cardiac  findings  in  the  setting  of  ocular  involvement,  an  infiltrative 
skin  rash,  or  a  nonspecific  febrile  illness.  They  may  also  present  less 
acutely after months to years of fluctuating cardiac symptoms. When 
ventricular tachycardia or conduction block dominates the initial pre-
sentation  of  heart  failure  without  coronary  artery  disease,  suspicion 
should be high for these granulomatous myocarditides.

Depending on the time course, the ventricles may appear restrictive 
or  dilated.  There  may  be  a  right  ventricular  predominance  of  both 
dilation and ventricular arrhythmias, sometimes initially attributed to 
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, with which sarcoi-
dosis shares multiple features.

Small ventricular aneurysms are common in the heart with sarcoid. 
Computed  tomography  of  the  chest  often  reveals  pulmonary  lymph-
adenopathy  even  in  the  absence  of  clinical  lung  disease.  Metabolic 
imaging  (positron  emission  tomography  [PET])  of  the  whole  chest 
can highlight active sarcoid lesions that are avid for glucose. Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart can identify myocardial scar in a 
pattern not compatible with myocardial infarction, and this distinctive 
type of late gadolinium enhancement is associated, as in other cardiac 
disease,  with  increased  risk  of  ventricular  arrhythmias.  To  rule  out 
chronic infections, such as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis, as the cause 
of  adenopathy,  the  diagnosis  often  requires  pathologic  confirmation. 
Biopsy  of  enlarged  mediastinal  nodes  may  provide  the  highest  yield. 
The  scattered  granulomata  of  sarcoidosis  are  commonly  missed  on 
cardiac biopsy (Fig. 259-8).

Immunosuppressive treatment for sarcoidosis is initiated with high-
dose glucocorticoids, often supplemented with methotrexate, and is gen-
erally more effective in suppressing arrhythmias than improving severely 
impaired  systolic  function.  Patients  with  sarcoid  lesions  that  persist 
or  recur  during  tapering  of  corticosteroids  are  considered  candidates 
for  other  immunosuppressive  therapies.  Pacemakers  and  implantable 
defibrillators  are  generally  indicated  to  prevent  life-threatening  heart 
block or ventricular tachycardia, respectively. Because the inflamma-
tion often resolves into extensive fibrosis that impairs cardiac function 
and  provides  pathways  for  reentrant  arrhythmias,  the  prognosis  for 
improvement is best when the density of granulomata is limited and 
the ejection fraction is not severely reduced.

Giant cell myocarditis is less common than sarcoidosis, but accounts 
for  10–20%  of  biopsy-positive  cases  of  myocarditis.  Giant  cell  myo-
carditis  typically  presents  with  rapidly  progressive  heart  failure  and 
tachyarrhythmias in patients generally older than those with acute viral 
myocarditis. Diffuse granulomatous lesions are surrounded by exten-
sive inflammatory infiltrate unlikely to be missed on endomyocardial 
biopsy, often with eosinophilic infiltration. Associated conditions are 
thymomas, thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, other autoimmune diseases,

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemresponse, but also unleash immune attack against host tissues express-
ing PD-L1, which include myocytes and endothelial cells and multiple 
organs, such as liver, pancreas, thyroid, skin, and skeletal muscle. The 
frequency of myocarditis as reported is <0.5%, is higher with mono-
clonal therapy against PD-1 than against CTLA4, and is over tenfold 
higher  with  combined  used  of  two  checkpoint  inhibitors.  Patients 
can present with acute heart failure, often with bizarre electrocardio-
graphic arrhythmias or conduction block and with evidence of skeletal 
myositis.  Echocardiography  may  suggest  myocardial  edema  without 
ventricular dilation, and initial ejection fraction may not be markedly 
reduced. Troponin is often positive, B-type natriuretic peptide may be 
elevated,  and  creatine  phosphokinase  may  be  high,  particularly  with 
skeletal involvement. If performed, MRI shows widespread inflamma-
tion, and biopsy shows extensive lymphocytic infiltration with CD4+ 
and  CD8+  T  cells  and  CD68+  macrophages.  The  diagnosis  should 
be suspected immediately with acute cardiac presentation in patients 
treated with checkpoint inhibitors, who may also present initially with 
other acute organ system involvement, which warrants urgent multidis-
ciplinary management usually in an intensive care unit. Initial therapy 
involves  high-dose  glucocorticoids,  which  may  be  followed  by  other 
immunosuppressive agents. Reported fatality in fulminant checkpoint 
inhibition  myocarditis  has  been  ~50%  and  is  higher  after  combined 
checkpoint inhibition. Less commonly, cardiovascular involvement can 
cause pericarditis or arteritis, particularly temporal arteritis.

 ■ PERIPARTUM CARDIOMYOPATHY
Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) develops during the last trimester 
or within the first 6 months after pregnancy, affecting between 1:2000 
and  1:4000  deliveries  in  the  United  Sates.  Risk  factors  are  increased 
maternal  age,  increased  parity,  twin  pregnancy,  malnutrition,  use  of 
tocolytic therapy for premature labor, and preeclampsia or toxemia of 
pregnancy.  Several  of  these  risk  factors  contribute  to  antiangiogenic 
signaling through secreted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
inhibitors,  such  as  soluble  FLT1  (sFLT1).  Recent  animal  and  human 
studies have confirmed the role of decreased angiogenic reserve in the 
pathogenesis of PPCM, which may be rescued by correcting the angio-
genic  imbalance.  Another  recently  proposed  mechanism  invokes  an 
abnormal prolactin cleavage fragment, which is induced by oxidative 
stress and also affects angiogenesis; this observation has led to prelim-
inary investigation of bromocriptine as possible therapy.

However,  other  processes  also  contribute  to  PPCM.  Heart  failure 
early  after  delivery  was  previously  common  in  Nigeria,  when  the 
custom for new mothers included salt ingestion while reclining on a 
warm bed, which likely impaired mobilization of the excess circulating 
volume after delivery. In the Western world, lymphocytic myocarditis 
has  sometimes  been  found  on  myocardial  biopsy.  This  inflamma-
tion has been hypothesized to reflect increased susceptibility to viral 
myocarditis or an autoimmune myocarditis due to cross-reactivity of 
anti-uterine antibodies against cardiac muscle.

As  the  increased  circulatory  demand  of  pregnancy  can  aggravate 
other cardiac disease that was clinically unrecognized, it is crucial to 
the diagnosis of PPCM that there be no evidence for a preexisting car-
diac disorder. By contrast, heart failure presenting earlier in pregnancy 
has  been  termed  pregnancy-associated  cardiomyopathy  (PACM). 
Both PPCM and PACM have been found in some families with other 
presentations of DCM. As in familial and sporadic DCM, truncating 
mutations, predominantly in TTN, are present in 15% of patients with 
PPCM and are associated with systolic dysfunction that persists. Preg-
nancy  may  represent  another  example  of  environmental  triggers  for 
accelerated phenotypic expression of genetic cardiomyopathies.

 ■ TOXIC CARDIOMYOPATHY
Cardiotoxicity  has  been  reported  with  multiple  environmental  and 
pharmacologic agents. Often these associations are seen only with very 
high levels of exposure or acute overdoses, in which acute electrocar-
diographic  and  hemodynamic  abnormalities  may  reflect  both  direct 
drug effect and systemic toxicity.

Alcohol  is  the  most  common  toxin  implicated  in  chronic  DCM. 
Excess consumption may contribute to >10% of cases of heart failure,

and  occasionally  recent  infections.  Glucocorticoid  therapy  alone  is 
rarely  effective,  but  in  combination  with  other  immunosuppression 
therapies similar to those used for severe transplant rejection, it may 
improve  short-term  outcomes  in  patients  who  are  hemodynamically 
stable at presentation. Most patients in cardiogenic shock from giant 
cell myocarditis progress to urgent mechanical support or transplan-
tation,  which  may  be  precluded  by  systemic  infection  from  inten-
sive  immunosuppression.  Although  the  severity  of  presentation  and 
myocardial  histology  are  more  fulminant  than  with  sarcoidosis,  the 
occasional finding of giant cell myocarditis after a previous diagnosis 
of sarcoidosis suggests that they may share the same disease spectrum.
Eosinophilic  myocarditis  can  be  an  important  manifestation  of  the 
hypereosinophilic syndrome, which in Western countries is often con-
sidered idiopathic, although in Mediterranean and African countries, 
it  is  associated  with  antecedent  infection.  It  may  also  be  seen  with 
systemic  eosinophilic  syndromes  such  as  Churg-Strauss  syndrome 
or  malignancies.  Hypersensitivity  myocarditis  is  often  an  unexpected 
diagnosis, made when the biopsy reveals infiltration with lymphocytes 
and  mononuclear  cells  with  a  high  proportion  of  eosinophils.  Most 
commonly, the reaction is attributed to antibiotics, particularly those 
taken  chronically,  but  thiazides,  anticonvulsants,  indomethacin,  and 
methyldopa  have  also  been  implicated.  Occasional  associations  with 
the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia) have been reported. Although the cir-
culating eosinophil count may be slightly elevated in hypersensitivity 
myocarditis, it is lower than in the hypereosinophilic syndrome. High-
dose  glucocorticoids  and  discontinuation  of  the  trigger  agent  can  be 
curative for hypersensitivity myocarditis.

Myocarditis is often associated with systemic inflammatory diseases, 
such  as  polymyositis  and  dermatomyositis,  which  affect  skeletal  and 
cardiac  muscle.  Although  noninfective  inflammatory  myocarditis  is 
sometimes included in the differential diagnosis, cardiac involvement 
with  connective  tissue  disease  such  as  systemic  lupus  erythematosus 
more  often  presents  as  pericarditis,  vasculitis,  pulmonary  hyperten-
sion, and accelerated coronary artery disease.

The most dramatic form of noninfectious inflammatory myocarditis 
is  that  seen  with  combined  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors.  Targeted 
monoclonal  antibody  therapy  to  unblock  the  host  immune  response 
has produced remarkable remission of melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, 
refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and other advanced tumors. Inhibi-
tory receptors on T lymphocytes (such as CTLA4 and PD-1) and the 
“programmed death” ligands, such as PD-L1, on target tissues interact 
to turn off immune activation as part of normal autoregulation. Tumor 
cells  can  upregulate  these  ligands  to  hide  from  immune  recognition. 
Antibodies  to  the  inhibitory  receptors  or  ligands  can  reawaken  host

1964 including  exacerbation  of  heart  failure  with  structural  heart  disease. 
Alcoholic  cardiomyopathy  causes  many  more  hospital  admissions  in 
men than women, but prevalence is similar between men and women 
with alcoholism, with left ventricular dysfunction detected in about a 
third  of  asymptomatic  patients.  Estimates  of  the  alcohol  intake  nec-
essary  to  cause  cardiomyopathy  have  been  4–5  ounces  or  80–100  g  
of  pure  ethanol  daily  for  5–10  years,  about  1  L  of  wine,  8  beers,  or  
½ pint of hard liquor. Frequent binge drinking may also be sufficient. 
Toxicity  is  attributed  both  to  alcohol  and  to  its  primary  metabolite, 
acetaldehyde. Chronic heavy exposure may alter metabolism, protein 
synthesis,  substrate  utilization,  and  oxidative  stress.  Polymorphisms 
of  the  genes  encoding  alcohol  dehydrogenase  and  the  angiotensin- 
converting enzyme may influence the likelihood of alcoholic cardiomy-
opathy. Superimposed vitamin deficiencies and toxic alcohol additives 
are  rarely  implicated  currently.  Mutations  in  TTN  and  other  DCM 
disease  genes  can  be  identified  in  ~10%  of  patients  with  presumed 
alcohol cardiomyopathy.

Many patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy are fully functional in 
their daily lives without apparent stigmata of alcoholism. The cardiac 
impairment  in  severe  alcoholic  cardiomyopathy  is  the  sum  of  both 
permanent damage and a substantial component that is reversible after 
cessation of alcohol consumption. Atrial fibrillation occurs commonly 
both  early  in  the  disease  (“holiday  heart”)  and  in  advanced  stages. 
Medical  therapy  includes  neurohormonal  antagonists  and  diuretics 
as  needed  for  fluid  management.  Withdrawal  should  be  supervised 
to  avoid  exacerbations  of  heart  failure  or  arrhythmias,  and  ongoing 
support arranged. Even with severe disease, marked improvement can 
occur  within  3–6  months  of  abstinence,  but  the  prognosis  is  grim  if 
alcohol consumption continues.

Cocaine,  amphetamines,  and  related  catecholaminergic  stimulants 
can produce chronic cardiomyopathy as well as acute ischemia, tach-
yarrhythmias,  malignant  hypertension,  aortic  dissection,  and  stroke. 
Cardiac  pathology  reveals  microinfarcts  consistent  with  small  vessel 
ischemia, similar to those seen with pheochromocytoma, and throm-
bosis secondary to endothelial dysfunction in the case of cocaine.

Chemotherapy  agents  are  the  most  common  drugs  implicated  in 
toxic cardiomyopathy. Judicious use balances risks of the malignancy 
and the risks of cardiotoxicity presented not only by the drug regimens 
but  also  by  the  patient’s  cardiovascular  profile  and  possibly  genetic 
factors influencing myocyte response to injury. Receipt of cardiotoxic 
drugs or radiation may warrant designation as “stage B” heart failure, 
with asymptomatic changes in cardiac structure and biomarkers. Once 
symptoms are apparent, the prognosis with heart failure is worse than 
for many types of cancer.

Anthracyclines  (e.g.,  doxorubicin)  cause  characteristic  histologic 
changes of vacuolar degeneration and myofibrillar loss. Multiple mech-
anisms  have  been  implicated,  involving  reactive  oxygen  species  and 
iron compounds, mitochondrial damage, transcription factors such as 
hypoxia-induced factor, and, most recently, inhibition of topoisomerase 
II involved in DNA repair. Risk for cardiotoxicity increases with older 
age, preexisting cardiac disease, higher doses or combination therapies, 
or  left  chest  irradiation.  Systolic  dysfunction  can  occur  acutely  with 
symptoms  of  heart  failure  noted  soon  after  drug  administration,  but 
more  often  is  detected  by  surveillance  echocardiography  during  the 
first year after exposure. Doxorubicin cardiotoxicity generally does not 
result in marked left ventricular dilation, such that stroke volume and 
systemic perfusion can be severely reduced with only a modest reduc-
tion of ejection fraction. Therapy for reduced ejection fraction includes 
β-adrenergic receptor blockade and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin 
system, with conflicting data on whether these agents decrease toxicity 
when  given  in  parallel  with  chemotherapy.  Once  thought  to  have  an 
inexorable  downward  course,  many  patients  with  symptomatic  heart 
failure can improve to near-normal function with careful management, 
including prevention of “second-hit” insults such as atrial fibrillation or 
hypertension. The course differs for some children treated with these 
agents  before  puberty,  in  whom  inadequate  growth  of  the  heart  may 
lead to refractory heart failure as they reach their twenties.

Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is one of the humanized monoclonal anti-
bodies that interfere with human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2), 

which is crucial for growth of some tumors, such as breast cancer, and 
for  cardiac  adaptation.  Cardiotoxicity  is  highest  when  anthracyclines 
are administered in conjunction with trastuzumab; however, less tox-
icity is seen now when these agents are combined compared with the 
toxicity observed previously with paclitaxel for breast cancer. Although 
more  often  reversible  than  anthracycline  cardiotoxicity,  trastuzumab 
cardiomyopathy may persist in about a third of affected patients and 
can  progress  to  clinical  heart  failure  and  death.  For  cardiotoxicity 
with  anthracyclines  or  trastuzumab,  therapy  is  recommended  as  for 
other  causes  of  reduced  ejection  fraction,  but  it  is  not  clear  whether 
treatment enhances the spontaneous rate of improvement or whether 
it decreases progression.

Cardiotoxicity  with  cyclophosphamide  and  ifosfamide  generally 
occurs  acutely  and  with  very  high  doses.  5-Fluorouracil,  cisplatin, 
and some other alkylating agents can cause recurrent coronary spasm 
that  occasionally  leads  to  depressed  contractility.  Acute  administra-
tion  of  interferon-α,  interleukin  2,  and  other  cytokine-based  thera-
pies  can  cause  hypotension  and  arrhythmias.  Clinical  heart  failure 
occurring  during  their  chronic  administration  usually  resolves  after 
discontinuation.

VEGF, produced endogenously or by tumors, enhances angiogenesis 
by activating the VEGF signaling pathways. Inhibitors of this pathway 
and  its  receptors  are  potent  against  multiple  cancers.  Many  small- 
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that affect VEGF are in use for different 
malignancies.  Although  these  agents  are  “targeted”  at  specific  tumor 
receptors or pathways, the biologic conservation of signaling pathways 
means that some of these drugs also find targets in the cardiovascular 
and  other  organ  systems.  Blood  pressures  increase  in  most  patients 
during therapy, attributed to an imbalance between endogenous vaso-
dilators  and  vasoconstrictors  and  alteration  of  glomerular  function. 
Hypertension  and  proteinuria  can  develop  with  these  agents,  similar 
to  preeclampsia,  and  presentation  is  associated  with  increased  risk 
of  future  cardiac  disease.  Recognition  of  cardiotoxicity  during  ther-
apy with these agents is complicated because they occasionally cause 
peripheral fluid accumulation (ankle edema, periorbital swelling, pleu-
ral effusions) due to local factors rather than elevated central venous 
pressures. Therapeutic approaches include withdrawal of the tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (when possible) and conventional treatment for heart 
failure.  Newer  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  effective  against  multiple 
kinases may have more complex off-target effects.

The most dramatic toxicity of contemporary cancer therapy results 
from combined immune checkpoint inhibitors, which block the natu-
ral counterregulatory T-cell suppression and unleash potentially fatal 
inflammation  directed  toward  multiple  organs  that  can  include  the 
heart and vessels. These are discussed in the previous section on non-
infectious myocarditis (above).

Proteasome inhibitors used to treat multiple myeloma are associated 
with an increased risk of hypertension, ischemic events, thromboem-
bolism, and heart failure. The more potent agent, carfilzomib, appears 
more cardiotoxic than bortezomib.

Other  therapeutic  drugs  that  can  cause  cardiotoxicity  during 
chronic use include tumor necrosis factor α antagonists for rheumato-
logic conditions, and carbamazepine, clozapine, and lithium for neuro-
logic and psychiatric diagnoses. Antiretroviral therapies for HIV have 
been implicated in cardiomyopathy. Chloroquine and hydroxychloro-
quine are widely used for systemic lupus erythematosus and rheuma-
toid arthritis and can decrease ejection fraction with either restrictive 
or dilated phenotype, often in association with conduction block. The 
presumed mechanism of toxicity is impaired lysosomal function, with 
accumulation of inclusion bodies that can be seen on cardiac biopsy.

Toxic exposures can cause arrhythmias or respiratory injury acutely 
during  accidents.  Chronic  exposures  implicated  in  cumulative  cardi-
otoxicity  include  hydrocarbons,  fluorocarbons,  arsenicals,  lead,  and 
mercury.

 ■ METABOLIC CAUSES OF CARDIOMYOPATHY
Endocrine  disorders  affect  multiple  organ  systems,  including  the 
heart. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism do not often cause clinical 
heart failure in an otherwise normal heart but commonly exacerbate

heart failure. Clinical signs of thyroid disease may be masked, so tests 
of thyroid function are part of the routine evaluation of cardiomyop-
athy.  Hyperthyroidism  should  always  be  considered  with  new-onset 
atrial  fibrillation  or  ventricular  tachycardia  or  atrial  fibrillation  in 
which the rapid ventricular response is difficult to control. The most 
common current reason for thyroid abnormalities in the cardiac pop-
ulation is the treatment of tachyarrhythmias with amiodarone, a drug 
with  substantial  iodine  content.  Hypothyroidism  should  be  treated 
with very slow escalation of thyroid supplements to avoid exacerbating 
tachyarrhythmias and heart failure. Hyperthyroidism and heart failure 
create  a  dangerous  combination  that  merits  very  close  supervision, 
often  hospitalization,  during  titration  of  antithyroid  medications, 
during which decompensation of heart failure may occur precipitously 
and fatally.

Pheochromocytoma is rare but should be considered when a patient 
has  heart  failure  and  very  labile  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate, 
sometimes  with  episodic  palpitations  (Chap.  387).  Patients  with 
pheochromocytoma  often  have  postural  hypotension.  In  addition  to 
α-adrenergic receptor antagonists, definitive therapy requires surgical 
extirpation. Very high renin states, such as those caused by renal artery 
stenosis, can lead to modest depression in ejection fraction with little 
or  no  ventricular  dilation  and  markedly  labile  symptoms  with  flash 
pulmonary edema, related to sudden shifts in vascular tone and intra-
vascular volume.

Controversies  remain  regarding  whether  diabetes  and  obesity  are 
sufficient  to  cause  cardiomyopathy.  Most  heart  failure  in  diabetes 
results from epicardial coronary disease, with further increase in coro-
nary artery risk due to accompanying hypertension and renal dysfunc-
tion. Cardiomyopathy may result in part from insulin resistance and 
increased  advanced-glycosylation  end  products,  which  impair  both 
systolic and diastolic function. However, much of the dysfunction can 
be attributed to scattered focal ischemia resulting from distal coronary 
artery  tapering  and  limited  microvascular  perfusion  even  without 
proximal focal stenoses. Diabetes is a typical factor in heart failure with 
“preserved” ejection fraction, along with hypertension, advanced age, 
and female gender.

The  existence  of  a  cardiomyopathy  due  to  obesity  is  generally 
accepted. In addition to cardiac involvement from associated diabetes, 
hypertension, and vascular inflammation of the metabolic syndrome, 
obesity  alone  is  associated  with  impaired  excretion  of  excess  volume 
load, which, over time, can lead to increased wall stress and secondary 
adaptive neurohumoral responses. Fluid retention may be aggravated 
by large fluid intake and the rapid clearance of natriuretic peptides by 
adipose tissue. In the absence of another obvious cause of cardiomy-
opathy in an obese patient with systolic dysfunction without marked 
ventricular  dilation,  effective  weight  reduction  is  often  associated 
with  major  improvement  in  ejection  fraction  and  clinical  function. 
Improvement in cardiac function has been described after successful 
bariatric surgery, although all major surgical therapy poses increased 
risk  for  patients  with  heart  failure.  Postoperative  malabsorption  and 
nutritional  deficiencies,  such  as  calcium  and  phosphate  deficiencies, 
may be particularly deleterious for patients with cardiomyopathy.

Nutritional  deficiencies  can  occasionally  cause  DCM  but  are  not 
commonly  implicated  in  developed  countries.  Beri-beri  heart  disease 
due  to  thiamine  deficiency  can  result  from  poor  nutrition  in  under-
nourished populations and in patients deriving most of their calories 
from  alcohol  and  has  been  reported  in  teenagers  subsisting  only  on 
highly processed foods. This disease is initially a vasodilated state with 
very-high-output heart failure that can later progress to a low-output 
state; thiamine repletion can lead to prompt recovery of cardiovascular 
function.  Abnormalities  in  carnitine  metabolism  can  cause  dilated 
or  restrictive  cardiomyopathies,  usually  in  children.  Deficiency  of 
trace  elements  such  as  selenium  can  cause  cardiomyopathy  (Keshan’s 
disease).

Calcium  is  essential  for  excitation-contraction  coupling.  Chronic 
deficiencies  of  calcium,  such  as  can  occur  with  hypoparathyroidism 
(particularly  postsurgical)  or  intestinal  dysfunction  (from  diarrheal 
syndromes and following extensive resection), can cause severe chronic 
heart  failure  that  responds  over  days  or  weeks  to  vigorous  calcium

repletion.  Phosphate  is  a  component  of  high-energy  compounds 
needed for efficient energy transfer and multiple signaling pathways. 
Hypophosphatemia can develop during starvation and early refeeding 
following a prolonged fast and occasionally during hyperalimentation. 
Hemochromatosis  is  variably  classified  as  a  metabolic  or  storage 
disease (Chap. 414). It is included among the causes of restrictive car-
diomyopathy, but the clinical presentation is often that of a DCM. The 
autosomal recessive form is related to the HFE gene. With up to 10% of 
the population heterozygous for one mutation, the clinical prevalence 
might be as high as 1 in 500. The lower observed rates highlight the 
limited  penetrance  of  the  disease,  suggesting  the  role  of  additional 
genetic and environmental factors such as alcoholism affecting clinical 
expression. Cardiac siderosis can also be acquired from iron overload 
due to hemoglobinopathies in patients treated with recurrent transfu-
sions. Excess iron is deposited in the perinuclear compartment of car-
diomyocytes, with resulting disruption of intracellular architecture and 
mitochondrial function. Diagnosis is easily made from measurement 
of serum iron and transferrin saturation, with a threshold of >60% for 
men and >45–50% for women. MRI can help to quantitate iron stores 
in the liver and heart, and endomyocardial biopsy tissue can be stained 
for iron (Fig. 259-9), which is particularly important if the patient has 
another cause for cardiomyopathy. If diagnosed early, hemochromato-
sis can often be managed by repeated phlebotomy to remove iron. For 
more severe iron overload, iron chelation therapy with desferrioxamine 
(deferoxamine) or deferasirox can help to improve cardiac function if 
myocyte loss and replacement fibrosis are not too severe.

Inborn  disorders  of  metabolism  occasionally  present  with  DCM, 
although they are most often associated with restrictive cardiomyop-
athy (Table 259-4).
 ■ FAMILIAL DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
The genetic basis for cardiomyopathy is discussed above in the section, 
“Genetic  Etiologies  of  Cardiomyopathy.”  The  recognized  frequency 
of familial involvement in DCM has increased to >30%. Mutations in 
TTN, encoding the giant sarcomeric protein titin, are the most com-
mon cause of DCM, accounting for up to 25% of familial disease. On 
average, men with TTN mutations develop cardiomyopathy a decade 
before women, without distinctive clinical features. Mutations in thick 
and thin filament genes account for ~8% of DCM and may manifest in 
early childhood.

The  most  recognizable  familial  cardiomyopathy  syndromes  with 
extracardiac manifestations are the muscular dystrophies. Both Duch-
enne’s and the milder Becker’s dystrophies result from abnormalities in 
the X-linked dystrophin gene of the sarcolemmal membrane. Skeletal 
myopathy  is  present  in  multiple  other  genetic  cardiomyopathies 
(Table 259-3), some of which are associated with creatine kinase elevations.

Patients and families with a history of arrhyth-
mias  and/or  conduction  system  disease  that  pre-
cede  or  supersede  cardiomyopathy  may  have 
abnormalities  of  the  nuclear  membrane  lamin 
proteins,  which  are  present  in  ~5%  of  patients 
with DCM. While all DCMs carry a risk of sudden 
death,  a  family  history  of  cardiomyopathy  with 
sudden  death  raises  suspicion  for  a  particularly 
arrhythmogenic  mutation;  affected  family  mem-
bers may be considered for implantable defibrilla-
tors to prevent sudden death even without meeting 
the reduced ejection fraction threshold.

RV

A prominent family history of sudden death or 
ventricular tachycardia before clinical cardiomyo-
pathy  suggests  genetic  defects  in  the  desmosomal 
proteins  (Fig.  259-10).  Originally  described  as 
affecting the right ventricle (arrhythmogenic right 
ventricular cardiomyopathy [ARVC]), this disorder 
(arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy) can affect either 
or both ventricles. Patients often present first with 
ventricular tachycardia. Genetic defects in proteins of the desmosomal 
complex disrupt myocyte junctions and adhesions, leading to replace-
ment  of  myocardium  by  deposits  of  fat.  Thin  ventricular  walls  may 
be recognized on echocardiography but are better visualized on MRI. 
Because desmosomes are also important for elasticity of hair and skin, 
some of the defective desmosomal proteins are associated with striking 
“woolly hair” and thickened skin on the palms and soles. Implantable 
defibrillators  are  usually  indicated  to  prevent  sudden  death.  There  is 
variable progression to right, left, or biventricular failure.

Left  ventricular  noncompaction  is  a  condition  of  unknown  preva-
lence  that  is  increasingly  suspected  with  the  refinement  of  imaging 
techniques.  The  diagnostic  criteria  include  the  presence  of  multiple 
trabeculations in the left ventricle distal to the papillary muscles, creat-
ing a “spongy” appearance of the apex, but are increasingly recognized 
as nonspecific findings in other cardiac diseases. Noncompaction has 
been  associated  with  multiple  genetic  variants  in  the  sarcomeric  and 
other  genes,  such  as  TAZ  (encoding  tafazzin).  The  diagnosis  may  be 
made  incidentally  or  in  patients  previously  diagnosed  with  cardio-
myopathy,  in  whom  the  criteria  for  noncompaction  may  appear  and 
disappear with changing left ventricular size and function. The three 
cardinal  clinical  features  of  ventricular  arrhythmias,  embolic  events, 
and  heart  failure  are  largely  restricted  to  noncompaction  with  con-
comitant  systolic  dysfunction.  Treatment  generally  includes  antico-
agulation  and  early  consideration  for  an  implantable  defibrillator,  in 
addition to neurohormonal antagonists as indicated by stage of disease.
Some families inherit a susceptibility to viral-induced myocarditis. 
This propensity may relate to abnormalities in cell surface receptors, 
such  as  the  coxsackie-adenovirus  receptor,  that  bind  viral  proteins. 
Some may have partial homology with viral proteins such that an auto-
immune response is triggered against the myocardium.

Prognosis and therapy of familial DCM are dictated primarily by the 
stage of clinical disease and the risk for sudden death. In some cases, the 
familial etiology facilitates prognostic decisions, particularly regarding the 
likelihood of recovery after a new diagnosis, which is unlikely for familial 
disease.  The  rate  of  progression  of  disease  is  to  some  extent  heritable, 
although marked variation can be seen. However, there have been cases 
of  remarkable  clinical  remission  after  acute  presentation,  likely  after  a 
reversible “second hit,” such as prolonged tachycardia or viral myocarditis.

 ■ TAKOTSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY
The apical ballooning syndrome, or acute stress-induced cardiomyop-
athy, occurs typically in older women after sudden intense emotional 
or physical stress. The ventricle shows global ventricular dilation with 
basal contraction, forming the shape of the narrow-necked jar (takotsubo) 
used in Japan to trap octopuses. Originally described in Japan, it is well 
recognized  elsewhere  during  emergency  cardiac  catheterization  and 
intensive care unit admissions for noncardiac conditions. Presentations 
include  pulmonary  edema,  hypotension,  and  chest  pain  with  ECG 
changes mimicking an acute infarction. The left ventricular dysfunction

extends  beyond  a  specific  coronary  artery  distribution  and  generally 
resolves  within  days  to  weeks.  Animal  models  and  ventricular  biop-
sies  suggest  that  this  acute  cardiomyopathy  may  result  from  intense 
sympathetic  activation  with  heterogeneity  of  myocardial  autonomic 
innervation, diffuse microvascular spasm, and/or direct catecholamine 
toxicity. Cardiac MRI demonstrates diffuse myocardial edema without 
necrosis.  Coronary  angiography  may  be  required  to  rule  out  acute 
coronary  occlusion.  No  therapies  have  been  proven  beneficial,  but 
reasonable strategies include nitrates for pulmonary edema; intraaortic 
balloon  pump  if  needed  for  low  output,  provided  transient  left  ven-
tricular outflow tract obstruction is absent; combined alpha and beta 
blockers rather than selective beta blockade if hemodynamically stable; 
and magnesium for arrhythmias related to QT prolongation. The long-
term prognosis is generally good, with the lowest mortality associated 
with  episodes  triggered  by  emotional  rather  than  physical  triggers. 
In-hospital complications and mortality are similar to acute myocardial 
infarction. Recurrences have been described in up to 10% of patients.

 ■ IDIOPATHIC DCM
Idiopathic DCM is a diagnosis of exclusion, when all other known fac-
tors have been excluded. Approximately two-thirds of DCMs are still 
labeled as idiopathic; however, a substantial proportion of these may 
reflect  unrecognized  genetic  disease.  Continued  reconsideration  of 
etiology during chronic heart failure management often reveals specific 
causes later in a patient’s course.

OVERLAPPING TYPES OF 
CARDIOMYOPATHY
The limitations of our phenotypic classification are revealed through 
the multiple overlaps between the etiologies and presentations of the three 
types.  Cardiomyopathy  with  reduced  systolic  function  but  without 
severe dilation can represent early DCM, “minimally dilated cardiomy-
opathy,” or restrictive diseases without marked increases in ventricular 
wall  thickness.  For  example,  sarcoidosis  and  hemochromatosis  can 
present  as  dilated  or  restrictive  disease.  Early  stages  of  amyloidosis 
are  often  mistaken  for  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy.  Progression  of 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy into a “burned-out” phase occurs occa-
sionally, with decreased contractility and modest ventricular dilation. 
Overlaps are particularly common with the inherited metabolic disor-
ders, which can present as any of the three major phenotypes (Fig. 259-4).
 ■ DISORDERS OF METABOLIC PATHWAYS
Multiple genetic disorders of metabolic pathways can cause myocardial 
disease,  due  to  infiltration  of  abnormal  products  or  cells  containing 
them  between  the  myocytes,  and  storage  disease,  due  to  their  accu-
mulation  within  cells  (Tables  259-3  and  259-4).  Hypertrophic  car-
diomyopathy  may  be  mimicked  by  the  myocardium  thickened  with 
these  abnormal  products  causing  “pseudohypertrophy,”  usually  with 
an abnormally short PR interval. The pseudohypertrophic phenotype

been  associated  with  a  high  prevalence  of  conduction  abnormalities, 
such  as  AV  block  and  ventricular  preexcitation.  Several  defects  have 
been reported in an X-linked lysosome-associated membrane protein 
(LAMP2). This defect can be maternally transmitted or sporadic and 
has occasionally been isolated to the heart, although it often leads to 
a syndrome of skeletal myopathy, mental retardation, and hepatic dys-
function referred to as Danon’s disease. Extreme left ventricular hyper-
trophy appears early, often in childhood, and can progress rapidly to 
end-stage heart failure with low ejection fraction. Electron microscopy 
of these metabolic disorders shows that the myocytes are enlarged by 
multiple intracellular vacuoles of metabolic by-products.

RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY
Restrictive cardiomyopathy is dominated by abnormal diastolic func-
tion,  often  with  mildly  decreased  contractility  and  ejection  fraction 
(usually  30–50%).  Both  atria  are  enlarged,  sometimes  massively. 
Modest  left  ventricular  dilation  can  be  present,  usually  with  an  end- 
diastolic dimension <6 cm. End-diastolic pressures are elevated in both 
ventricles, with preservation of cardiac output until late in the disease. 
Subtle  exercise  intolerance  is  usually  the  first  symptom  but  is  often 
not recognized until after clinical presentation with congestive symp-
toms. The restrictive diseases often present with relatively more right-
sided  symptoms,  such  as  edema,  abdominal  discomfort,  and  ascites, 
although filling pressures are elevated in both ventricles. The cardiac 
impulse is less displaced than in DCM and less dynamic than in hyper-
trophic cardiomyopathy. A fourth heart sound is more common than 
a third heart sound in sinus rhythm, but atrial fibrillation is common. 
Jugular venous pressures often show rapid Y descents and may increase 
during inspiration (positive Kussmaul’s sign). Most restrictive cardio-
myopathies  are  due  to  infiltration  of  abnormal  substances  between 
myocytes, storage of abnormal metabolic products within myocytes, or 
fibrotic injury (Table 259-5). The differential diagnosis should include 
constrictive pericardial disease, which may also be dominated by right-
sided heart failure.
 ■ INFILTRATIVE DISEASE
The most common restrictive cardiomyopathy is amyloidosis, in which 
a  common  protein  assembles  into  β-pleated  sheets  of  amyloid  fibrils 
that infiltrate between cells of target organs (Figs. 259-12, 259-13, and 
259-14). Almost all amyloid that affects the heart is caused by assembly 
either of immunoglobulin light chains from clonal plasma cells (AL or 
“primary” amyloid) or of transthyretin (ATTR), which is made in the 
liver and can either be an inherited mutant protein (ATTRm) or the 
normal  protein  (ATTRwt  [wild-type],  which  accumulates  with  age, 
leading to cardiac amyloid in half of people >90 years old, but clini-
cally  much  more  common  in  men  than  women).  There  are  multiple 
mutations in the transthyretin molecule, of which the most common is 
V1221, which confers a 50% increased risk of heart failure in the 3-4% 
of African Americans who are heterozygous, but it is often clinically 
silent.

Right heart failure often dominates the clinical presentation of car-
diac  amyloidosis,  although  both  ventricles  are  affected.  Conduction 
system disease and atrial fibrillation are common. Nephrotic syndrome 
is common in AL amyloid, which may also cause angina as the amy-
loid  encircles  the  coronary  arteries.  Because  the  ventricular  cavity  is 
diminished  by  amyloid  infiltration,  cardiac  output  may  be  very  low 
with a modest ejection fraction reduction. Peripheral and autonomic 
neuropathy are common in both AL amyloidosis and ATTRm amyloi-
dosis. A history of carpal tunnel syndrome is common in ATTRm and 
ATTRwt, often preceding cardiac symptoms by many years. ATTRwt 
is also associated with spinal stenosis.

Amyloidosis  should  be  suspected  when  ventricular  myocardium 
appears thick on imaging with low ECG voltage, but this mismatch is 
more common with AL than TTR amyloidosis. Atrial enlargement is 
prominent  and  diastolic  dysfunction  more  severe  than  that  of  other 
causes  of  hypertrophy.  Longitudinal  strain  is  frequently  more  pre-
served at the apex, creating a “bull’s-eye” pattern. MRI shows diffuse 
late  gadolinium  enhancement.  Technetium-pyrophosphate  scanning 
reliably highlights TTR amyloidosis but does not detect AL amyloid.

ventricular  endomyocardial  biopsy  specimen  at  high  magnification  showing  the

is most common, but restrictive cardiomyopathy and DCM may occur. 
Most of these diseases are diagnosed during childhood.

Fabry’s  disease  results  from  a  deficiency  of  the  lysosomal  enzyme 
alpha-galactosidase  A  caused  by  one  of  more  than  160  mutations  in 
GLA.  This  disorder  of  glycosphingolipid  metabolism  is  an  X-linked 
disorder that may also cause clinical disease in female carriers. Glyco-
lipid accumulation may be limited to the cardiac tissues but usually also 
involves the skin, peripheral nerve, and kidney. Electron microscopy of 
endomyocardial  biopsy  tissue  shows  diagnostic  vesicles  containing 
concentric  lamellar  figures  (Fig.  259-11).  Diagnosis  can  be  made 
through  assessment  of  enzyme  activity  and/or  GLA  sequencing  and 
is crucial because enzyme replacement can reduce abnormal deposits 
and improve cardiac and clinical function. The magnitude of clinical 
impact has not been well established for this therapy, which requires 
frequent  infusions  of  the  enzyme  at  a  cost  of  >$100,000  a  year.  The 
oral  chaperone  therapy,  migalastat,  stabilizes  mutant  forms  of  alpha- 
galactosidase,  increases  enzymatic  activity,  and  was  approved  for  use 
in a subset of patients with Fabry’s disease bearing mutations amenable 
to  this  therapy.  Enzyme  replacement  can  also  improve  the  course  of 
Gaucher’s disease, in which cerebroside-rich cells accumulate in mul-
tiple organs due to a deficiency of beta-glucosidase. Cerebroside-rich 
cells infiltrate the heart, which can also lead to a hemorrhagic pericar-
dial effusion and valvular disease.

Glycogen storage diseases lead to accumulation of lysosomal stor-
age  products  and  intracellular  glycogen  accumulation,  particularly 
with  glycogen  storage  disease  type  III,  due  to  a  defective  debranching 
enzyme. There are >10 types of mucopolysaccharidoses, in which auto-
somal  recessive  or  X-linked  deficiencies  of  lysosomal  enzymes  lead 
to  the  accumulation  of  glycosaminoglycans  in  the  skeleton,  nervous 
system,  and  occasionally  the  heart.  With  characteristic  facies,  short 
stature, and frequent cognitive impairment, most individuals are diag-
nosed early in childhood and die before adulthood.

Carnitine  is  an  essential  cofactor  in  long-chain  fatty  acid  metab-
olism.  Multiple  defects  have  been  described  that  lead  to  carnitine 
deficiency, causing intracellular lipid inclusions and restrictive cardio-
myopathy or DCM, often presenting in children. Fatty acid oxidation 
requires  many  metabolic  steps  with  specific  enzymes  that  can  be 
deficient, with complex interactions with carnitine. Depending on the 
defect, cardiac and skeletal myopathy can be ameliorated with replace-
ment of fatty acid intermediates and carnitine.

Two  monogenic  metabolic  cardiomyopathies  cause  markedly 
increased  ventricular  wall  thickness  without  an  increase  of  muscle 
subunits  or  an  increase  in  contractility.  Mutations  in  the  gamma-2 
regulatory subunit of the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated 
protein  kinase  important  for  glucose  metabolism  (PRKAG2)  have

Endomyocardial biopsy is virtually 100% reliable for the diagnosis of 
all  amyloid  due  to  the  characteristic  birefringence  pattern  of  Congo 
red  staining  of  the  amyloid  fibrils  under  polarized  light,  but  immu-
nohistochemistry  may  be  necessary  to  confirm  the  amyloid  type,  as 
serum or urine electrophoresis may be misleading. Until recently, the 
therapy of amyloidosis was limited to the treatment of congestion and 
arrhythmias.  There  is  no  evidence  for  benefit  from  neurohormonal 
antagonists, which may complicate the postural hypotension and fixed 
low stroke volume of amyloid disease. However, specific therapies for 
amyloidosis are changing the prognosis. Median survival with AL amy-
loidosis was previously 6–12 months but has markedly improved with 
the  use  of  the  proteasome  inhibitor  bortezomib.  If  present,  multiple 
myeloma may be treated with conventional chemotherapy, if not lim-
ited by cardiac dysfunction. AL amyloid can sometimes be treated with 
heart  transplantation  followed  by  delayed  stem  cell  transplantation, 
with some risk of recurrence of amyloid in the transplanted heart. The 
course of TTR amyloidosis is measured in years even after the typical 
delay in diagnosis and may be affected by new therapies. Stabilizers of 
the normal transthyretin structure, tafamidis and diflusinal, have been 
approved for therapy of the associated neuropathy and are now being 
studied  for  effect  on  cardiac  outcomes.  Expression  of  transthyretin 
can be decreased by patisiran, a small interfering RNA that decreases 
message production, or inotersen, an antisense mRNA that enhances 
mRNA  degradation.  Both  have  been  approved  as  treatment  for  the 
polyneuropathy  of  TTR  amyloid,  with  possible  benefit  on  long-term 
outcomes.  These  therapies  have  not  yet  been  approved  for  a  cardiac 
indication.

 ■ FIBROTIC RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYOPATHY
Progressive  fibrosis  can  cause  restrictive  myocardial  disease  without 
ventricular dilation. Thoracic radiation, common for breast and lung 
cancer or mediastinal lymphoma, can produce early or late restrictive

worse symptoms and prognosis but may be diffi-
cult  to  suppress.  Surgical  resection  of  the  apices 
and replacement of the fibrotic valves can improve 
symptoms,  but  surgical  morbidity  and  mortality 
and later recurrence rates are high.

The serotonin secreted by carcinoid tumors can 
produce  fibrous  plaques  in  the  endocardium  and

be  stenotic  or  regurgitant.  Systemic  symptoms 
include flushing and diarrhea. Liver disease from 
hepatic  metastases  may  play  a  role  by  limiting 
hepatic function and thereby allowing more sero-
tonin to reach the venous circulation.

HYPERTROPHIC 
CARDIOMYOPATHY
Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  is  defined  as  left 
ventricular  hypertrophy  that  develops  in  the 
absence  of  causative  hemodynamic  factors,  such 
as  hypertension,  aortic  valve  disease,  or  systemic 
infiltrative or storage diseases (Figs. 259-15 and 259-16). It has previ-
ously been termed hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), 
asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH), and idiopathic hypertrophic subaor-
tic stenosis (IHSS). However, the accepted terminology is now hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy with or without obstruction. Prevalence in North 
America, Africa, and Asia is about 1:500. It is a leading cause of sudden 
death in the young and is an important cause of heart failure. Although 
pediatric presentation is associated with increased early morbidity and 
mortality,  the  prognosis  for  patients  diagnosed  as  adults  is  generally 
favorable,  although  worse  than  for  age-matched  individuals  without 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

A sarcomere mutation is present in ~50% of patients with hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy and is more common in those with familial disease 
and characteristic asymmetric septal hypertrophy. More than nine differ-
ent genes with >1500 mutations have been implicated, although ~80% of 
patients have a mutation in either MYH7 or MYBPC3 (Table 259-3).

stripping surgery, which is unlikely to be successful in the presence of 
underlying restrictive cardiomyopathy. Scleroderma causes small vessel 
spasm and ischemia that can lead to a small, stiff heart with reduced 
ejection fraction without dilation. The pulmonary hypertension asso-
ciated with scleroderma may lead to more clinical right heart failure 
because of concomitant fibrotic disease of the right ventricle.

 ■ ENDOMYOCARDIAL DISEASE
The physiologic picture of elevated filling pressures with atrial enlarge-
ment and preserved ventricular contractility with normal or reduced 
ventricular volumes can result from extensive fibrosis of the endocar-
dium, without transmural myocardial disease. For patients who have 
not lived in the equatorial regions, this picture is rare, and when seen is 
often associated with a history of chronic hypereosinophilic syndrome 
(Löffler’s  endocarditis),  which  is  more  common  in  men  than  women. 
In  this  disease,  persistent  hypereosinophilia  of  >1500  eosinophils/μL 
for at least 6 months can cause an acute phase of eosinophilic injury in 
the endocardium (see earlier discussion of eosinophilic myocarditis), 
with  systemic  illness  and  injury  to  other  organs.  Hypereosinophilic 
syndromes  can  occasionally  be  explained  by  allergic  or  parasitic  dis-
ease, but are increasingly being recognized as due to myeloproliferative 
variants. It is postulated to be followed by a period in which cardiac 
inflammation  is  replaced  by  evidence  of  fibrosis  with  superimposed 
thrombosis. In severe disease, the dense fibrotic layer can obliterate the 
ventricular apices and extend to thicken and tether the AV valve leaf-
lets. The clinical disease may present with heart failure, embolic events, 
and  atrial  arrhythmias.  While  plausible,  the  sequence  of  transition 
from eosinophilic myocarditis or Löffler’s endocarditis to endomyocar-
dial fibrosis has not been clearly demonstrated.

In tropical countries, up to one-quarter of heart failure may be due 
to  endomyocardial  fibrosis,  affecting  either  or  both  ventricles.  This 
condition  shares  with  the  previous  condition  the  partial  obliteration 
of the ventricular apex with fibrosis extending into the valvular inflow 
tract  and  leaflets;  however,  it  is  not  clear  that  the  etiologies  are  the 
same  for  all  cases.  Pericardial  effusions  frequently  accompany  end-
omyocardial fibrosis but are not common in Löffler’s endocarditis. For 
endomyocardial  fibrosis,  there  is  no  gender  difference,  but  there  is  a 
higher  prevalence  in  African-American  populations.  While  tropical 
endomyocardial  fibrosis  could  represent  the  end-stage  of  previous 
hypereosinophilic disease triggered by endemic parasites, neither prior 
parasitic infection nor hypereosinophilia is usually documented. Geo-
graphic nutritional deficiencies have also been proposed as an etiology.
Clonal proliferation with specific mutations may respond to mono-
clonal  antibody  therapy.  Other  treatment  includes  glucocorticoids 
to  suppress  hypereosinophilia  when  present.  Fluid  retention  may 
become  increasingly  resistant  to  diuretic  therapy.  Anticoagulation  is

cardiomyopathy  shows  asymmetric  hypertrophy  of  the  septum  compared  to  the

toward the hypertrophied septum in systole. The left atrium (LA) is enlarged. Note 
that the echocardiographic and pathologic images are vertically opposite, such that 
the LV is by convention on the top right in the echocardiographic image and bottom 
right in the pathologic images. (Image courtesy of Justina Wu, MD, Brigham and 
Women’s Hospital, Boston.)

Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  is  characterized  by  age-dependent 
and incomplete penetrance. The defining phenotype of left ventricular 
hypertrophy is rarely present at birth and usually develops later in life. 
Women appear to have lower penetrance of sarcomere mutations and 
an  older  age  at  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  diagnosis  but  subse-
quently increased rates of heart failure and mortality thereafter. Accord-
ingly,  screening  of  family  members  should  begin  in  adolescence  and 
extend through adulthood. In MYBPC3 mutation carriers, the average 
age of disease development is ~40 years, while 30% remain free from 
hypertrophy  after  70  years.  Related  individuals  who  carry  the  same 
mutation may have a different extent and pattern of hypertrophy (e.g., 
asymmetric  vs  concentric),  occurrence  of  outflow  tract  obstruction, 
and associated clinical outcomes, although sudden death and progres-
sion to heart failure occur more commonly in families with that history.
At the level of the sarcomere, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy muta-
tions lead to enhanced calcium sensitivity, maximal force generation, 
and  ATPase  activity.  Calcium  handling  is  affected  through  modifi-
cation  of  regulatory  proteins.  Sarcomere  mutations  lead  to  abnormal 
energetics  and  impaired  relaxation,  both  directly  and  as  a  result 
of  hypertrophy.  Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  is  characterized  by 
misalignment  and  disarray  of  the  enlarged  myofibrils  and  myocytes 
(Fig. 259-17), which can also occur to a lesser extent in other cardiac 
diseases. Although hypertrophy is the defining feature of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy,  fibrosis  and  microvascular  disease  are  also  present. 
Interstitial  fibrosis  is  detectable  before  overt  hypertrophy  develops 
and likely results from early activation of profibrotic pathways. In the 
majority of patients with overt cardiomyopathy, focal areas of replace-
ment fibrosis can be readily detected with MRI. These areas of “scar” 
may  represent  substrate  for  the  development  of  ventricular  arrhyth-
mias. Increased thickness and decreased luminal area of the intramural 
vessels  in  hypertrophied  myocardium  contribute  to  microvascular

cardiomyopathy showing the characteristic disarrayed myocyte architecture with

ischemia and angina. Microinfarction of hypertrophied myocardium is 
a hypothesized mechanism for replacement scar formation.

Macroscopically,  hypertrophy  is  typically  manifest  as  nonuniform 
ventricular thickening (Fig. 259-15). The interventricular septum is the 
typical location of maximal hypertrophy, although other patterns of hyper-
trophic remodeling include concentric and midventricular. Hypertrophy 
confined to the ventricular apex (apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) is 
less often familial and has a different genetic substrate, with sarcomere 
mutations present in only ~15%. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruc-
tion  represents  the  most  common  focus  of  diagnosis  and  intervention, 
although  diastolic  dysfunction,  myocardial  fibrosis,  and  microvascular 
ischemia also contribute to contractile dysfunction and elevated intracar-
diac pressures. Obstruction is present in ~30% of patients at rest and can 
be provoked by exercise in another ~30%. Systolic obstruction is initiated 
by drag forces, which push an anteriorly displaced and enlarged anterior 
mitral  leaflet  into  contact  with  the  hypertrophied  ventricular  septum. 
Mitral leaflet coaptation may ensue, leading to posteriorly directed mitral 
regurgitation.  In  order  to  maintain  stroke  volume  across  outflow  tract 
obstruction,  the  ventricle  generates  higher  pressures,  leading  to  higher 
wall  stress  and  myocardial  oxygen  demand.  Smaller  chamber  size  and 
increased contractility exacerbate the severity of obstruction. Conditions 
of low preload, such as dehydration, and low afterload, such as arterial 
vasodilation, may lead to transient hypotension and near-syncope. The 
systolic ejection murmur of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is 
harsh and late peaking and can be enhanced by bedside maneuvers that 
diminish ventricular volume and transiently worsen obstruction, such as 
the Valsalva maneuver or standing from a squatting position.

DIAGNOSIS
The substantial variability of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathology 
is  reflected  in  the  diversity  of  clinical  presentations.  Patients  may  be 
diagnosed  after  undergoing  evaluations  triggered  by  the  abnormal 
physical  findings  (murmur)  or  by  symptoms  of  exertional  dyspnea, 
angina,  or  syncope.  Alternatively,  diagnosis  may  follow  evaluations 
prompted  by  the  detection  of  disease  in  family  members.  Cardiac 
imaging  (Fig.  259-16)  is  central  to  diagnosis,  for  which  the  physical 
examination  and  ECG  are  insensitive.  The  identification  of  a  dis-
ease-causing  mutation  in  a  proband  can  focus  family  evaluations  on 
mutation carriers, but this strategy requires a high degree of certainty 
that the mutation is truly pathogenic and not a benign DNA variant. 
Biopsy is not needed to diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but can 
be used to exclude infiltrative and metabolic diseases. Rigorous athletic 
training  (athlete’s  heart)  may  cause  intermediate  degrees  of  physio-
logic  hypertrophy  difficult  to  differentiate  from  mild  hypertrophic

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemcardiomyopathy. Unlike hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertrophy in 
the athlete’s heart regresses with cessation of training and is accompa-
nied  by  supernormal  exercise  capacity  (VO2max  >50  mL/kg  per  min), 
mild ventricular dilation, and normal diastolic function.

TREATMENT
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Management  focuses  on  treatment  of  symptoms  and  prevention 
of sudden death and stroke (Fig. 259-18). Left ventricular outflow 
tract  obstruction  can  be  controlled  medically  in  the  majority  of 
patients. β-Adrenergic blocking agents and L-type calcium channel 
blockers (e.g., verapamil) are first-line agents that reduce the sever-
ity of obstruction by slowing heart rate, enhancing diastolic filling, 
and decreasing contractility. Persistent symptoms of exertional dys-
pnea or chest pain can sometimes be controlled with the addition 
of disopyramide, an antiarrhythmic agent with potent negative ino-
tropic properties. Novel small-molecule inhibitors of actin-myosin 
interactions are being developed for obstructive and nonobstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Patients with or without obstruction may develop heart failure 
symptoms due to fluid retention and require diuretic therapies for 
venous congestion. Severe medically refractory symptoms develop 
in ~5% of patients, for whom surgical myectomy or alcohol septal 
ablation  may  be  effective.  Developed  over  60  years  ago,  surgical 
myectomy effectively relieves outflow tract obstruction by excising 
part of the septal myocardium involved in the dynamic obstruction. 
In selected patients, perioperative mortality is extremely low with 
excellent  long-term  survival  free  from  recurrent  obstruction  and

symptoms.  Mitral  valve  repair  or  replacement  is  usually  unnec-
essary  as  associated  eccentric  mitral  regurgitation  resolves  with 
myectomy  alone.  Alcohol  septal  ablation  in  patients  with  suitable 
coronary anatomy can relieve outflow tract obstruction via a con-
trolled infarction of the proximal septum, which produces similar 
periprocedural outcomes and gradient reduction as surgical myo-
mectomy.  Until  long-term  outcomes  are  demonstrated  for  septal 
ablation  procedures,  they  are  relegated  primarily  to  patients  who 
wish to avoid surgery or who have limiting comorbidities. Neither 
procedure has been shown to improve outcomes other than symp-
toms. With both procedures, the most common complication is the 
development of complete heart block necessitating permanent pac-
ing. However, ventricular pacing as a primary therapy for outflow 
tract obstruction is ineffective and not generally advised.

Patients  with  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  have  an  increased 
risk  of  sudden  cardiac  death  from  ventricular  tachyarrhythmias. 
Vigorous  physical  activity  and  competitive  sports  have  been  his-
torically prohibited; however, ongoing studies are reexamining the 
relationship between exertion and ventricular arrhythmias in hyper-
trophic  cardiomyopathy.  Factors  that  increase  the  risk  of  sudden 
death from a baseline of 0.5% per year are presented in Table 259-6. 
As  sudden  death  has  not  been  reduced  by  medical  or  procedural 
interventions, traditionally an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator 
has  been  advised  for  patients  with  two  or  more  risk  factors  and 
advised on a selected basis for patient with one risk factor. Neverthe-
less, the positive predictive value of most risk factors is low, and many 
patients receiving a defibrillator never receive an appropriate device 
therapy. A complementary approach to sudden death risk stratifica-
tion and discussion with patients is the application of an externally 
validated  risk  score  using  major  criteria  from  Table  259-6  and

continuous  variables  such  as  outflow  tract  gradient  and  left  atrial 
size.  Shared  decision-making  around  implantable  cardioverter- 
defibrillator  implantation  for  primary  prevention  has  emphasized 
discussions of estimated risk levels rather than dichotomous yes-no 
criteria.  Long-term  use  of  a  defibrillator  may  be  associated  with 
serious  device-related  complications,  particularly  in  young  active 
patients. Refinement of sudden death risk through the application of 
contemporary technologies such as cardiac MRI is ongoing.

Atrial  fibrillation  is  common  in  patients  with  hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy and may lead to hemodynamic deterioration and 
embolic  stroke.  Rapid  ventricular  response  is  poorly  tolerated 
and  may  worsen  outflow  tract  obstruction.  β-Adrenergic  block-
ing  agents  and  L-type  calcium  channel  blockers  slow  AV  nodal 
conduction  and  improve  symptoms;  cardiac  glycosides  should  be 
avoided, as they may increase contractility and worsen obstruction. 
Even  with  adequate  rate  control,  symptoms  exacerbated  by  atrial 
fibrillation may persist due to loss of AV synchrony and may require 
restoration  of  sinus  rhythm.  Disopyramide  and  amiodarone  are 
the preferred antiarrhythmic agents, with radiofrequency ablation 

considered for medically refractory cases. Anticoagulation to pre-
vent embolic stroke in atrial fibrillation is recommended.

PROGNOSIS
The general prognosis for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is better than in 
early studies of referral populations, but mortality remains higher than 
in  an  age-matched  population  without  cardiomyopathy.  The  sudden 
death risk is <1% per year; however, up to 1 in 20 patients will progress to 
overt systolic dysfunction with a reduced ejection fraction (<50%) with 
or  without  dilated  remodeling  (i.e.,  “burned  out”  or  end-stage  hyper-
trophic  cardiomyopathy).  These  patients  may  suffer  from  low  cardiac 
output and have an increased risk of death from progressive heart failure 
and sudden death unless they undergo timely cardiac transplantation.

GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES
The  worldwide  prevalence  of  myocarditis  and  cardiomyopathy  com-
bined is estimated at 5.4 million people, compared to 26 million people 
with heart failure. The estimated prevalence of myocarditis/cardiomy-
opathy has increased by >50% since 1990 due to the growing popula-
tion, while the rate per 100,000 people has declined by >20% during 
the same period to 68, with an estimated mortality of 4.8 per 100,000. 
The highest age-standardized prevalence is reported in central Europe, 
whereas the highest attributed mortality is in Eastern Europe; however, 
comparison of myocardial diseases across eras and countries is compli-
cated by differing ascertainment and techniques for cardiac diagnoses.
For  comparison,  the  current  mortality  rates  are  similar  to  that  of 
rheumatic heart disease, which has declined overall by 26.5% and by 
55%  after  adjustment  for  age.  Deaths  from  Chagas’  cardiomyopathy 
worldwide have declined from 12.7 thousand to 10.6 thousand, with a 
reduction of 51.7% in the age-adjusted rates per 100,000 population to 
0.2, attributable, in major part, to improved health conditions in rural 
areas of South and Central America.

Health care for other diseases affects myocarditis and cardiomyopa-
thy. Developed nations will see a higher prevalence of cardiomyopathy 
due  to  chemotherapy.  However,  vaccination  has  reduced  deaths  from 
diphtheria-associated  myocarditis  to  <50  per  100  million  population, 
currently most common in Russia. World regions providing HAART for 
HIV have decreased not only transmission but also the rate of associated 
cardiomyopathy by several-fold. Increasing global availability of genetic 
testing is expected to shift the apparent epidemiology of cardiomyopathy 
away from acquired causes toward causative and facilitating genetic fac-
tors. For example, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction attrib-
uted to hypertension and diabetes is increasingly recognized to represent 
amyloidosis from mutant transthyretin, with distinct, recognized muta-
tions in Portugal, Japan, and the African-Caribbean population.

260 Cardiac Transplantation 
and Prolonged Assisted 
Circulation
Mandeep R. Mehra

Advanced  heart  failure,  a  distinct  syndrome,  is  characterized  by 
refractoriness  to  conventional  therapy  and  represents  a  vexing  clin-
ical  dilemma  that  is  associated  with  an  increased  symptom  burden, 
frequent hospitalization, a poor quality of life, and high risk of death. 
Such  individuals  do  not  tolerate  neurohormonal  antagonists  at  rec-
ommended  doses,  exhibit  cardiorenal  syndrome,  maintain  markedly 
poor cardiac reserve on cardiopulmonary stress testing, and typically 
display a low cardiac output state with elevated pulmonary pressures. 
In  general,  therapeutic  targets  shift  away  from  disease-modifying 
neurohormonal  therapy  to  surgical  options  that  attend  directly  to 
supporting  the  dysfunctional  heart  and  address  myocardial  stress 
and strain relationships. Most often, prolonged circulatory assistance 
using mechanical ventricular assist devices or cardiac transplantation 
is required to reliably improve quality of life and long-term survival.

CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION
A decade after Norman Shumway had accomplished the technique of a 
successful heart transplant in canines, Christiaan Barnard successfully 
performed the first human-to-human transplant on December 3, 1967. 
Now, >5 decades later, this surgery has become entrenched in the stan-
dard armamentarium for treating patients with advanced heart failure 
who are otherwise healthy enough to receive such a life-altering treat-
ment. Globally, >150,000 patients have undergone cardiac transplanta-
tion with a 1-year survival >80% and median survival of 12.5 years and 
conditional survival of 14.8 years if the recipient survives the first year 
after transplant. These gains have been ushered by advances in immu-
nosuppression,  identification  and  management  of  allograft  rejection, 
and  a  comprehensive  appreciation  for  late  complications  including 
accelerated coronary artery disease, malignancy, and renal failure.

 ■ CANDIDATES FOR CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION
The  demand  for  cardiac  transplantation  outstrips  the  availability  of 
organ  donors.  Hence,  attention  to  the  optimal  utility,  equitable  allo-
cation,  and  patient  autonomy  must  dominate  the  decisions  to  iden-
tify  and  list  candidates  for  transplantation.  Simultaneously,  attempts 
at  expanding  the  donor  pool  have  surfaced.  However,  vigilance  to 
evaluating  candidates  most  likely  to  have  a  successful  outcome  from 
transplantation takes pre-eminence. In 2006, the International Society 
for Heart and Lung Transplantation identified a set of criteria to guide 
listing  of  patients.  These  criteria  were  updated  in  2016  and  include 
additional  attention  to  the  growing  epidemiology  of  candidates  suf-
fering from congenital heart disease, restrictive and infiltrative cardio-
myopathy (such as amyloidosis), and chronic infections in recipients 
(such  as  Chagas’  disease,  tuberculosis  and  viral  hepatitis).  Selected 
general principles for listing candidates for cardiac transplantation are 
enumerated in Table 260-1.

 ■ PRINCIPLES OF DONOR RECOVERY AND 
ALLOCATION
Although  listing  criteria  for  candidates  are  typically  adjudicated  at 
a  center  level,  organ  allocation  is  handled  by  national  regulatory 
processes  in  most  countries.  The  allocation  of  donor  hearts  is  based 
on (1) the urgency of the clinical situation, (2) the time spent on the 
waiting list, and (3) the distance from the recipient center. Candidates 
who  are  hospitalized  in  critical  status  and  require  extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation or temporary mechanical circulatory support 
devices to support both ventricles are given the highest urgency status, 
followed  by  those  requiring  daily  invasive  hemodynamic  evaluation 
and intravenous inotropic therapy to maintain stability, or those with

COMMENT
Refractory heart failure with a VO2 of <14 mL/kg per min (<12, if 
on beta blockers) or percent predicted VO2 <50%; combination 
of intolerance to disease-modifying therapy, cardiorenal 
syndrome, use of inotropic therapy to maintain stability, or need 
for a left ventricular assist system.
Age is not an absolute contraindication, but frailty should 
be considered a relative contraindication; a BMI >35 kg/m2 
should require weight loss; cancer should be dealt with on 
an individual basis (e.g., low-grade prostate cancer may not 
be a contraindication); poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or 
end-organ damage may be a contraindication; eGFR <30 mL/
min/1.73 m2 is a relative contraindication, if persistent; severe 
cerebrovascular disease or peripheral vascular disease 
(which will limit rehabilitation or function) is also a relative 
contraindication.
Sensitized individuals with circulating antibodies should have 
a prospective or virtual cross match; pulmonary vascular 
resistance with a transpulmonary gradient >15, PVR >3 
Wood units, and absolute PA systolic pressure >50 mmHg 
provided the systolic blood pressure is >85 mmHg is a relative 
contraindication unless reactive to therapy.
Tobacco use in any form limits posttransplant survival and 
should be stopped for at least 6 months; substance abuse, 
including marijuana, should be a contraindication if the 
individual cannot demonstrate control and cessation; patients 
with severe cognitive-behavioral disabilities or dementia 
(inability to ever understand and cooperate with medical care) 
have the potential for self-harm and should not receive a 
transplant.

complications of a durable left ventricular assist device. Others stable 
at  home  while  supported  by  a  left  ventricular  assist  device  or  those 
able to ambulate and live at home receive a lower urgency status. The 
geographical regional reach for allocation is based not only on territo-
rial considerations but also on the time that a donor heart would be in 
transit and therefore in out of body “ischemia time,” which is typically 
limited to 4 h. The final key feature that is included in the allocation 
offer relates to the ABO blood group. Donor organs are offered based 
on these initial characteristics and then a more detailed donor assess-
ment  ensues,  resulting  in  acceptance  or  decline  for  any  given  donor 
heart. It is important to note that the time constraints imposed on the 
retrieval process make it difficult to invoke HLA matching of the donor 
and  recipient.  In  cases  where  there  is  a  high  likelihood  of  sensitiza-
tion in the recipient (preformed circulating antibodies against donor 
antigens),  a  prospective  or  virtual  cross  match  is  entertained  prior  
to acceptance. Other clinical criteria that are employed in the decision on 
accepting an offered donor include the donor-recipient size match, the 
age of the donor (typically restricted to <55 years, but is often exceeded 
due  to  organ  shortages),  and  presence  or  absence  of  concomitant 
pathology such as coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, 
or severe injury to the allograft manifest by excess leak of injury mark-
ers  (troponins)  or  poor  contractile  performance.  In  many  cases,  the 
prospective cardiac allograft can be reconditioned by use of hormonal 
therapy  (including  thyroid  hormone  supplementation)  and  used  for 
transplantation even if the initial evaluation suggests poor function. In 
efforts to enhance the donor pool, systems that allow ex vivo normoth-
ermic perfusion to evaluate and reanimate organs with a prolonged out 
of body time are being developed. The classic heart donor is derived 
from a donor with brain death; however, donors with circulatory death 
are being increasingly evaluated as candidates for cardiac reanimation 
using a variety of techniques including ex vivo reanimation and sub-
sequent transplantation. Such donor organs obtained after circulatory 
death  are  gaining  more  widespread  acceptance,  and  early  outcomes 
suggest that their outcomes after transplantation are no different from 
those of organs retrieved from brain death donors. In order to increase

1974 the number of viable donors, organs from those infected with hepatitis 
C virus are increasingly being utilized since curative antiviral therapy 
can be used in the recipient shortly after transplantation.
 ■ SURGERY FOR CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION
The most common contemporary operation is referred to as a “bi-caval” 
orthotopic cardiac transplant that mimics the natural anatomic posi-
tion. In this operation, the donor and recipient superior and inferior 
venae  cavae  are  connected  as  are  the  aortic  and  pulmonary  great 
vessels.  The  left  atrium  of  the  recipient  retains  its  roof  including  the 
draining pulmonary veins, and the donor left atrium is then sutured 
to the retained atrial tissue. This technique maintains function of the 
donor right atrium, important for governing early postoperative right 
heart output, and may prevent atrial arrhythmias. The recipient is left 
with a surgical denervation, and the allograft is not responsive to any 
physiologic  sympathetic  or  parasympathetic  stimuli.  Therefore,  early 
in  the  adaptive  postoperative  phase,  high-dose  catecholamines  are 
required  to  maintain  adequate  function.  Due  to  denervation,  brady-
cardia  in  a  cardiac  allograft  cannot  be  treated  with  atropine  and  the 
drug of choice is isoproterenol, or temporary electrical pacing is used. 
Once the cardiac allograft adapts to its host circulation, the function is 
usually adequate at rest and with exercise to provide normal physical 
activity and quality of life.
 ■ CARDIAC ALLOGRAFT REJECTION AND 
IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
The ability to perform endomyocardial biopsies and evaluate rejection 
pathologically  and  the  introduction  of  the  immunosuppression  agent 
cyclosporine heralded cardiac transplantation as a viable clinical therapy. 
Triple-drug  immunosuppression,  which  includes  a  calcineurin  inhibi-
tor  (cyclosporine  or  tacrolimus),  corticosteroids,  and  antiproliferative 
immunosuppression  (azathioprine,  mycophenolate  mofetil,  sirolimus, 
or  everolimus),  is  now  the  standard  combination  used.  The  combina-
tion  immunosuppression  strategy  that  is  most  commonly  used  and 
that  achieves  the  best  standard  outcomes  includes  tacrolimus,  myco-
phenolate  mofetil,  and  prednisone.  In  those  at  high  risk  for  rejection 
(multiparous women, sensitized individuals) or in situations where use 
of calcineurin inhibitors needs to be delayed (renal dysfunction), induc-
tion  therapy  using  monoclonal  (basiliximab)  or  polyclonal  antibodies 
(antithymocyte  globulin)  to  provide  augmented  immunosuppression 
is used. Over several months, as surveillance endomyocardial biopsies 
are  regularly  performed  and  clinical  as  well  as  subclinical  pathologic 
quiescence  is  established,  gradual  weaning  of  steroids  is  undertaken.  
Table 260-2 describes the immunosuppression drugs in common use.

Acute  cellular  rejection  (ACR)  and  antibody-mediated  rejection 
(AMR)  are  two  separate  forms  of  cardiac  allograft  rejection  that  are 

recognized and can sometimes coexist. ACR occurs early after trans-
plantation  and  then  tends  to  decline  in  incidence  after  6  months. 
This  occurs  due  to  a  T  cell–mediated  assault  on  the  donor  allograft 
tissue and histologically is characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates in 
the  myocardium.  In  mild  cases,  these  infiltrates  are  localized  to  the 
perivenular regions, and in severe cases, they progress diffusely into the 
cardiac interstitium. In late stages of severe ACR, most often associated 
with  hemodynamic  compromise,  multiclonal  cells  such  as  macro-
phages, neutrophils, and eosinophils are observed with intramyocardial 
hemorrhage,  myocyte  injury,  and  myocyte  necrosis.  Subclinical  ACR 
is typically treated with high doses of corticosteroid pulses, although 
some centers choose to simply observe mild forms of infiltration since 
it  is  known  that  many  of  these  patients  may  recover  spontaneously 
over  time.  If  hemodynamic  compromise  occurs,  rescue  polyclonal 
antibodies are used in tandem with corticosteroids. Conversely, AMR 
is  immunologically  described  as  a  noncellular  antibody-driven  phe-
nomenon associated with a pattern of immunopathologic findings of 
immunoglobulin deposition and complement fixation on immunofluo-
rescence,  along  with  histopathologic  findings  of  endothelial  swelling 
and interstitial edema and cardiac allograft arteriolar vasculitis. AMR 
is  characterized  by  the  emergence  of  circulating  donor-specific  anti-
bodies  that  are  thought  to  fix  complement  and  bind  to  the  allograft. 
Commonly,  AMR  leads  to  allograft  dysfunction,  increases  the  risk 
for  development  of  cardiac  allograft  vasculopathy,  and  is  associated 
with worsened cardiac allograft survival compared with ACR. In this 
form of rejection, therapy is directed toward suppression and removal 
of  circulating  antibodies  using  plasmapheresis  and  drugs  such  as 
rituximab (chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 
antigen)  or,  in  refractory  cases,  bortezomib  (a  proteasome  inhibitor) 
or eculizumab (a terminal complement inhibitor). The treatment with 
immunosuppression requires prophylaxis for opportunistic infections 
and ongoing surveillance and expertise in recognizing the more com-
mon  clinical  presentations  of  infections  caused  by  cytomegalovirus 
(CMV),  Aspergillus,  and  other  opportunistic  agents  such  as  Nocardia 
and toxoplasmosis.

 ■ LATE COMPLICATIONS AFTER CARDIAC 
TRANSPLANTATION
The long-term consequences of exposure to chronic immunosuppres-
sion  result  in  a  variety  of  nonimmunologic  cardiometabolic  effects 
such  as  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,  and  hyperglycemia,  as  well  as 
systemic disorders of bone loss and renal dysfunction. One aggressive 
complication that limits late survival of cardiac allografts includes the 
development of an accelerated form of coronary artery disease, referred 
to as cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). This is characterized by a

proliferative thickening of the vascular intima of the vasculature that 
is initiated as a diffuse endothelialitis in the setting of the confluence 
of the consequences of brain death, ischemia reperfusion injury during 
the transplant process, and early immunologic insults. Chronically, the 
metabolic  consequences  of  hypertension,  hyperlipidemia,  and  disor-
dered  glucose  regulation  result  in  worsening  of  vascular  lesions  that 
are  diffuse  and  noted  throughout  the  coronary  tree.  Early  diagnosis 
and preventative therapy are critical since it is commonly silent in its 
development.  Intravascular  ultrasound  is  more  sensitive  than  rou-
tine  coronary  angiography  for  the  diagnosis  of  CAV.  A  standardized 
grading  scheme  for  CAV  was  proposed  by  the  International  Society 
for Heart and Lung Transplantation in 2010. CAV is graded as absent 
(CAV0), mild (CAV1), moderate (CAV2), or severe (CAV3) based on 
extent  of  angiographic  disease  and  presence  of  allograft  dysfunction 
by  echocardiography  or  restrictive  cardiac  physiology.  The  grade  of 
CAV correlates with patient prognosis. Angiographic CAV is present 
in ~30% of patients by 5 years after transplant and ~50% of patients 
by  10  years  after  transplant.  Use  of  statins  may  help  prevent  CAV 
development after heart transplantation. Antihypertensive agents and 
anti-CMV therapy have demonstrated some benefits in reducing CAV 
with varying degrees of supportive evidence. Antiproliferative immu-
nosuppressive therapy such as mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus or 
everolimus prevents vascular intimal thickening compared with azathi-
oprine-based regimens. Options for medical treatment of established 
CAV  remain  limited.  Revascularization  using  percutaneous  coronary 
intervention  or  coronary  artery  bypass  grafting  may  be  employed 
in  selected  cases  with  focal  lesions  but  does  not  improve  survival  in 
patients  with  CAV.  However,  retransplantation  is  the  only  definitive 
form of therapy for advanced CAV (Fig. 260-1).

Another  concern  in  cardiac  transplantation  is  the  development  of 
malignancy  with  a  greater  frequency  than  in  the  normal  population, 
suggesting that immunosuppression plays a sentinel role in its gener-
ation.  Posttransplant  lymphoproliferative  disorders,  typically  driven 
by Epstein-Barr virus, occur most frequently and require a reduction 
in  immunosuppression,  administration  of  antiviral  agents,  and  tra-
ditional  chemo-  and  radiotherapy.  Specific  antilymphocyte  (targeted 
against  CD20)  therapy  has  also  shown  promise.  Solid  cancers  most 
often manifest as skin malignancies (both basal cell and squamous cell

is required to define strategies for immune modulation, immune sup-
pression, and malignancy prevention; however, the impact of decreas-
ing immunosuppression in the treatment of these cancers is unclear.

PROLONGED ASSISTED CIRCULATION
The quest for a prolonged and durable implantable mechanical circu-
latory support device has led to the development of continuous flow 
left ventricular assist systems (LVAS). Initially designed for short-term 
support as a bridge to recovery or to cardiac transplantation, the most 
frequent  use  today  entails  permanent  support  for  lifetime  therapy 
(“destination therapy”). The decision to implant LVAS dichotomously 
as either a bridge to transplantation or for destination therapy is not 
always  clear,  and  in  several  instances,  these  devices  are  used  as  a 
“bridge  to  decision”  (in  those  with  potentially  reversible  underlying 
relative  contraindications  such  as  renal  insufficiency  or  pulmonary 
hypertension, who may become future candidates for transplantation).
 ■ LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST SYSTEMS AND 
CLINICAL TRIALS
A pivotal trial, REMATCH, published in 2001, was the first study to 
reliably demonstrate that survival of patients with transplant-ineligible, 
refractory,  predominantly  inotropic  therapy–supported  heart  failure 
is  improved  by  implantation  of  an  LVAS.  This  study  used  an  early 
generation pulsatile flow device and demonstrated a 48% reduction in 
risk of death. However, the LVAS used was of limited durability, and 
meaningful  “out  of  hospital”  survival  was  prolonged  by  a  median  of 
only  5  months.  Furthermore,  complications  of  strokes,  multisystem 
organ failure, and infections reduced enthusiasm for widespread adop-
tion. Over time, continuous flow systems that had small turbo-pumps 
with minimal moving parts and no valves were introduced, leading to 
greater durability and more generalized worldwide adoption.

A landmark trial compared the older bulky pulsatile LVAS studied 
in the REMATCH trial with a newer generation axial continuous flow 
LVAS,  the  HeartMate  II,  and  demonstrated  a  marked  improvement 
in  short-  and  long-term  survival,  along  with  an  improvement  in 
functional  capacity  and  meaningful  quality-of-life  enhancement.  A 
centrifugal  continuous  flow  LVAS,  the  HeartWare  HVAD,  was  also

introduced and demonstrated noninferiority to the HeartMate II pump.  
A  newer  centrifugal  device  with  a  fully  magnetically  levitated  sys-
tem, the HeartMate 3 LVAS, is now the most commonly used pump. 
Unlike  the  HeartMate  II  LVAS,  which  requires  an  abdominal  pump 
pocket,  this  smaller  device  is  fully  implanted  in  the  thoracic  cavity 
(Fig. 260-2). This LVAS has been shown to nearly eliminate the com-
plication  of  pump  thrombosis  and  markedly  reduce  stroke  rates,  as 
well  as  decrease  bleeding  complications.  Real-world  experience  from 
registry analyses has pointed to a median survival of >50% at 4 years 
with  currently  available  LVAS;  however,  long-term  durability  beyond 
5–10  years  remains  a  question.  The  patients  for  whom  LVAS  should 
ideally be employed include those with severe persistent systolic heart 
failure symptoms who have failed to respond to optimal medical man-
agement. Commonly, these patients have marked functional limitation 
indicated by a peak oxygen consumption of <12 mL/kg per min, or the 
patient is bound to continuous intravenous inotropic therapy owing to 
symptomatic  hypotension  or  demonstrates  worsening  renal  function 
or persistent refractory congestion. Currently, the role of LVAS in “less 
sick” patients (those with moderate symptoms) is less well supported 
since sufficient equipoise does not exist due to the adverse risk-benefit 
ratio from device-related complications and because it needs to be teth-
ered to an external driveline that connects to a power source.

 ■ MANAGEMENT OF LVAS AND THEIR 
COMPLICATIONS
Continuous  flow  LVAS  rely  on  pressure  gradients  between  the  left 
ventricular  cavity  and  the  aorta.  As  such,  forward  flow  is  critically 
dependent on management of systemic blood pressure. Due to the low 
pulsatile nature of the blood flow, blood pressure is measured by using a 
Doppler ultrasound (which measures mean or opening blood pressure, 
which is less than the systolic blood pressure) since a peripheral pulse is 
usually not detectable. The ideal mean arterial blood pressure should be 
kept to ≤90 mmHg and antihypertensive drug therapy prescribed using 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system drugs or other vasodilators. The 
blood  flow  path  through  current  devices  results  in  increased  shear 
stress which may manifest in the form of low-grade hemolysis and the 
development of an acquired von Willebrand disease due to loss of high- 
molecular-weight  multimers  of  von  Willebrand  Factor.  This  hema-
tologic  aberration  has  been  associated  with  a  risk  of  gastrointestinal 

bleeding,  particularly  resulting  from  arteriovenous  malformations 
in  the  intestines.  Therefore,  a  common  complication  encountered  in 
patients is that of an anemia, often due to iron deficiency.

The  unsupported  right  ventricle  often  demonstrates  worsening 
function  and  results  in  congestion  requiring  diuretic  therapy.  While 
unloading of the left ventricle decreases right-sided afterload, increased 
device flow results in a greater right heart preload, and effects of the 
LVAS  on  the  septum  reduce  right  ventricular  contractile  efficiency, 
leading  to  development  of  right  ventricular  dilatation  and  maladap-
tation  between  the  right  ventricle  and  pulmonary  circuit.  Cardiac 
arrhythmias are common in patients supported with LVAS and often 
require antiarrhythmic therapy since such events can trigger low flow 
through the device.

Hemocompatibility-related  adverse  outcomes  include  neurologic 
events (ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes), device-related thrombosis 
leading to pump malfunction, and nonsurgical bleeding complications 
(Fig. 260-3). Antiplatelet therapy using aspirin in doses of 81–325 mg  
daily along with warfarin targeted to an international normalized ratio 
of 2–3 is used with current LVAS to avoid the morbidity of hemocom-
patibility-related  adverse  events.  On  one  hand,  this  therapy  protects 
against thrombotic complications, whereas on the other hand, it pre-
disposes  the  patient  to  bleeding  complications.  Strokes  occur  with  a 
frequency  ranging  from  10%  with  the  HeartMate  3  LVAS  to  as  high 
as  29%  with  the  HeartWare  HVAD  device  by  2  years  of  treatment. 
Optimal control of blood pressure is associated with improved rates of 
strokes with some devices such as the HeartWare HVAD pump; how-
ever, this complication is an important reason for lack of adoption of 
device therapy in the less sick population. Another cause of morbidity 
is  pump  thrombosis  requiring  reoperation  for  device  malfunction. 
This complication with the older devices was noted in 6–12% of LVAS 
implants, occurs early (in the first 6 months), and is more commonly 
encountered  with  the  HeartMate  II  device  than  with  the  HeartWare 
HVAD  pump.  The  subclinical  phase  of  LVAS  thrombosis  is  charac-
terized  by  increasing  hemolysis  and  elevation  in  the  device  power. 
Progressively, inability to “unload” the left ventricle is manifest leading 
to  decompensated  heart  failure  and  possibly  hemodynamic  compro-
mise.  Lactate  dehydrogenase  is  an  excellent  (although  nonspecific) 
biomarker  of  hemolysis  and  hence  impending  or  established  pump 
thrombosis. Patients who have suspected left ventricular assist device

FIGURE  260-3  Hemocompatibility-related  adverse  events  with  left  ventricular  assist  systems  (LVAS)  are  often  interrelated  and  typically  result  in  cerebrovascular, 
gastrointestinal, or pump malfunction events. AV, atrioventricular; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(LVAD)  thrombosis  and  do  not  undergo  LVAD  exchange  or  cardiac 
transplantation  have  a  6-month  mortality  rate  of  48%,  inferring  that 
medical therapy for ventricular assist device thrombosis may be inad-
equate  (or  cause  harm  in  the  case  of  thrombolytic  use).  Reoperation 
(pump  exchange)  carries  a  modest  6.5%  perioperative  mortality  risk 
and a 65% 2-year survival following exchange.

Infection is common, most often involving the driveline (the con-
duit connecting the device to the external controller and batteries) and 
occurs in 1 in 5 patients following LVAS implant. Such an infection is 
treated with local internal exploration and requires long-term suppres-
sive  antibiotics  unless  the  patient  undergoes  cardiac  transplantation 
or  the  device  is  exchanged.  Infection  and  its  inflammatory  sequelae 
predispose to thrombosis and heighten the risk of neurologic compli-
cations, leading to a worsening milieu in hemocompatibility.
 ■ NOVEL DEVICES
The HeartMate 3 is a centrifugal, continuous flow pump that is placed 
in the thorax and is engineered to be a more hemocompatible LVAS. 
This  device  is  constructed  with  a  fully  magnetically  levitated  motor, 
offers wider blood flow paths, and exhibits a fixed intrinsic pulse (by 
the  motor  ramping  its  speed  up  and  down  at  2-s  intervals).  These 
features  have  been  shown  to  reduce  rates  of  hemolysis  and  decrease 
the  shearing  of  high-molecular-weight  multimers  of  von  Willebrand 
factor. This pump has been tested in the MOMENTUM 3 trial, which 
reported its final results in 1028 patients randomly allocated to either 
the HeartMate 3 pump or the HeartMate II LVAS. The fully magnet-
ically  levitated  HeartMate  3  pump  was  associated  with  less  frequent 
need  for  pump  replacement  than  the  HeartMate  II  device  and  was 
superior with respect to survival free of disabling stroke or reoperation 
to  replace  or  remove  a  malfunctioning  device.  The  need  for  pump 
replacement and occurrence of stroke of any severity, major bleeding, 
or  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  were  lower  in  the  centrifugal-flow 
pump  group  than  in  the  axial-flow  pump  group.  Experience  beyond 
5 years with this LVAS will be important in discerning whether these 
findings result in improved long-term survival.

 ■ TOTAL ARTIFICIAL HEART
Not  all  patients  are  candidates  for  an  LVAS,  particularly  those  with 
severe right-sided heart failure or conditions that do not allow place-
ment  of  an  LVAS  (restrictive  cardiomyopathy,  massive  anterior  myo-
cardial infarction, complex congenital heart disease). In such patients, 
either  a  biventricular  assist  device  approach  or  a  total  artificial  heart 
pump  can  be  considered.  The  SynCardia  total  artificial  heart  is  a 

pulsatile, implantable pump that consists of two polyurethane ventricles 
with pneumatically driven diaphragms and four tilting disc valves. This 
requires excision of the native ventricles and thus cannot be employed 
as a myocardial recovery strategy. There are specific clinical issues that 
are unique to the total artificial heart management. This device operates 
on a steep physiologic curve and has little adaptability to tolerate either 
systemic  blood  pressure  changes  or  large  shifts  in  blood  volume.  As 
the ventricles are excised, most patients exhibit a sharp decline in renal 
function due to the loss of natriuretic peptide expression by the myocar-
dium. Severe hemolysis is common due to the presence of four mechan-
ical  valves,  and  aberrant  erythropoiesis  is  noted,  leading  to  a  severe 
anemia. Newer artificial hearts using biocompatible surfaces are under 
development, as well as those that use continuous flow technology.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
While  LVAS  are  available  worldwide,  their  use  and  indications  vary 
from country to country. In the United States, payers used to require 
discrete discrimination of indication into either a bridge to transplant 
or  destination  therapy,  whereas  in  most  European  countries,  this 
artificial  segregation  was  not  used.  Cost-effectiveness  studies  suggest 
improvement  with  the  newer  devices,  yet  some  countries  only  allow 
use of this technology as a bridge to transplantation (United Kingdom) 
while awaiting more definitive long-term studies for lifetime use. The 
use  of  LVAS  in  moderately  symptomatic  ambulatory  patients  with 
chronic systolic heart failure is still discouraged throughout the world, 
awaiting  the  availability  of  hemocompatible  devices  that  can  be  fully 
internalized  without  the  need  for  an  external  driveline.  Globally,  the 
rates of myocardial recovery allowing for decommissioning or removal 
of devices remain low.

GLOBAL BURDEN OF VALVULAR  
HEART DISEASE
Primary  valvular  heart  disease  ranks  well  below  coronary  heart  dis-
ease,  stroke,  hypertension,  obesity,  and  diabetes  as  a  major  threat  to 
the public health. Nevertheless, it can cause significant morbidity and 
lead to premature death. Rheumatic fever (Chap. 359) is the dominant 
cause  of  valvular  heart  disease  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries. 
Its prevalence has been estimated to range from as low as 1 per 100,000 
school-age  children  in  Costa  Rica  to  as  high  as  150  per  100,000  in 
China  (Fig.  261-1).  Rheumatic  heart  disease  accounts  for  12–65%  of 
hospital  admissions  related  to  cardiovascular  disease  and  2–10%  of 
hospital  discharges  in  some  endemic  countries.  Prevalence  and  mor-
tality rates vary among communities even within the same country as 
a  function  of  overcrowding  and  the  availability  of  medical  resources 
and population-wide programs for detection and treatment of group A 
streptococcal pharyngitis. In economically deprived areas, tropical and 
subtropical  climates  (particularly  on  the  Indian  subcontinent  and  in 

Southeast Asia), Central America, and the Middle East, rheumatic val-
vular disease progresses more rapidly than in more developed nations 
and frequently causes serious symptoms in patients aged <20 years. This 
accelerated natural history may be due to repeated infections with more 
virulent  strains  of  rheumatogenic  streptococci.  Approximately  30–35 
million  people  live  with  rheumatic  heart  disease  worldwide,  an  esti-
mated prevalence characterized by 300,000 new cases and 233,000 case 
fatalities  per  year,  with  the  highest  prevalence  and  age-adjusted  mor-
tality rates in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Oceania. The major 
drivers  of  untreated  streptococcal  pharyngitis  in  these  endemic  areas 
include reduced access to high-quality health care and social determi-
nants of health. In the United States, rheumatic heart disease accounted 
for 3320 deaths in 2017. Although globally the age standardized mor-
tality rate from rheumatic heart disease declined by nearly 50% between 
1990 and 2015, the prevalence of heart failure attributable to rheumatic 
heart disease increased by nearly 90% over the same time interval.

Although  there  have  been  recent  reports  of  isolated  outbreaks  of 
streptococcal infection in North America, valve disease in high-income 
countries  is  dominated  by  degenerative  or  inflammatory  processes 
that  lead  to  valve  thickening,  fibrosis,  calcification,  and  dysfunction. 
The  prevalence  of  valvular  heart  disease  increases  significantly  with 
age. The prevalence of undiagnosed moderate or severe valvular heart 
disease  is  ~6%  in  individuals  aged  >65  years.  Significant  left-sided 
valve disease may affect as many as 12–13% of adults aged >75 years 
(Fig.  261-2).  Severe  aortic  stenosis  (AS)  is  estimated  to  affect  3.5% 
of  the  population  aged  >75  years.  A  Swedish  epidemiologic  study 
estimated  the  incidence  of  newly  diagnosed  valvular  heart  disease  at 
64 per 100,000 person-years. AS and mitral regurgitation contributed 
approximately  one-half  and  one-quarter,  respectively,  of  the  valvular 
heart disease diagnoses in this study.

The incidence of infective endocarditis (Chap. 128) has increased 
with  the  aging  of  the  population,  the  more  widespread  prevalence 
of  vascular  grafts  and  intracardiac  devices,  the  emergence  of  more 
virulent  multidrug-resistant  microorganisms,  the  growing  epidemic 
of diabetes mellitus, and the opioid crisis. The more restricted use of 
antibiotic prophylaxis since 2007 has not been convincingly associated 
with  an  increase  in  incidence  rates  for  infective  endocarditis  cases 
attributable  to  oropharyngeal  pathogens.  Infective  endocarditis  has 
become  a  relatively  more  frequent  cause  of  acute  valvular  regurgita-
tion. Valve surgery during the acute phase of infective endocarditis is 
performed in ~50% of hospitalized patients. Duration of intravenous 
antibiotic use may be shortened in selective cases.

FIGURE  261-2  The  burden  of  moderate  or  severe  mitral  and  aortic  valve  disease  in  the 
United  States.  Prevalence  estimates  are  derived  from  three  population-based  studies 
comprising  a  total  of  11,911  individuals:  The  Coronary  Artery  Risk  Development  in  Young 
Adults (CARDIA), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), and the Cardiovascular 
Health Study (CHS). (Reproduced with permission from VT Nkomo et al: Burden of valvular 
heart diseases: A population-based study. Lancet 368:1005, 2006.)

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease affects as many as 0.5–1.4% of 
the general population and is accompanied by an associated aortopa-
thy in ~30-40% of individuals, a disease process expressed as root or 
ascending  aortic  aneurysm  formation  or  descending  thoracic  aortic 
coarctation. An increasing number of childhood survivors of congen-
ital  heart  disease  present  later  in  life  with  valvular  dysfunction.  The 
global burden of valvular heart disease will continue to progress.

As  is  true  for  many  other  chronic  health  conditions,  disparities 
in  access  to  and  quality  of  care  for  patients  with  valvular  heart  dis-
ease  have  been  well  documented,  especially  for  those  patients  with 
rheumatic heart disease in low- and middle-income countries. In the 
Society for Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology 
(ACC)  Transcatheter  Valve  Therapy  (TVT)  registry,  blacks  comprise 
<5% of patients in the United States who have received a transcatheter 
valve  for  AS.  Management  decisions  and  outcome  differences  based 
on age, sex, race, and geography require intensification of educational 
efforts and prioritization of resources.

The  role  of  the  physical  examination  in  the  evaluation  of  patients 
with  valvular  heart  disease  is  also  considered  in Chaps. 42 and 239; 
of electrocardiography (ECG) in Chap. 240; of echocardiography and 
other  noninvasive  imaging  techniques  in  Chap.  241;  and  of  cardiac 
catheterization and angiography in Chap. 242.
AORTIC STENOSIS
Aortic  stenosis  (AS)  is  the  most  common  valve  lesion  among  adult 
patients  with  chronic  valvular  heart  disease;  the  majority  of  adult 
patients with symptomatic, valvular AS are male.
 ■ ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
(Table  261-1)  AS  in  adults  is  due  to  degenerative  calcification  of  the 
aortic  cusps  and  occurs  most  commonly  on  a  substrate  of  congenital 
disease (BAV), chronic (trileaflet) deterioration, or previous rheumatic 
inflammation.  A  pathologic  study  of  specimens  removed  at  the  time 
of  aortic  valve  replacement  (AVR)  for  AS  in  adults  showed  that  53% 
were  bicuspid  and  4%  were  unicuspid.  The  process  of  aortic  valve 
deterioration and calcification is not a passive one, but rather one that 
shares  many  features  with  vascular  atherosclerosis,  including  endo-
thelial  dysfunction,  lipid  accumulation,  inflammatory  cell  activation,

cytokine release, and upregulation of several signaling pathways 
(Fig.  261-3).  Eventually,  a  fibrocalcific  response  is  established 
wherein  collagen  is  deposited  and  valvular  myofibroblasts  dif-
ferentiate  phenotypically  into  osteoblasts  and  actively  produce 
bone  matrix  proteins  that  allow  for  the  deposition  of  calcium 
hydroxyapatite  crystals.  Genetic  polymorphisms  involving  the 
vitamin  D  receptor,  the  estrogen  receptor  in  postmenopausal 
women, interleukin 10, and apolipoprotein E4 have been linked 
to the development of calcific AS, and a strong familial clustering 
of  cases  with  trileaflet  valves  has  been  reported  from  western 
France. Several traditional atherosclerotic risk factors have also 
been  associated  with  the  development  and  progression  of  cal-
cific AS, including hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol,  lipoprotein  a  (Lp[a]),  diabetes  mellitus,  smoking, 
chronic kidney disease, and the metabolic syndrome. In a Cana-
dian observational cohort study, the incidence of severe AS was 
144 per 100,000 person-years. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
and dyslipidemia accounted for approximately one-third of the 
population-attributable risk for severe AS. The presence of aortic 
valve sclerosis (focal thickening and calcification of the leaflets 
not  severe  enough  to  cause  obstruction)  is  associated  with  an 
excess  risk  of  cardiovascular  death  and  myocardial  infarction 
(MI)  among  persons  aged  >65.  Approximately  30%  of  persons 
aged >65 years exhibit some degree of aortic valve sclerosis. Rate and 
extent of progression to valve obstruction (stenosis) vary among indi-
vidual patients.

≥75

Rheumatic disease of the aortic leaflets produces commissural fusion, 
sometimes resulting in a bicuspid-appearing valve. This condition, in 
turn,  makes  the  leaflets  more  susceptible  to  trauma  and  ultimately 
leads  to  fibrosis,  calcification,  and  further  narrowing.  By  the  time 
obstruction to left ventricular (LV) outflow causes serious clinical dis-
ability, the valve is usually a rigid calcified mass, and careful examina-
tion may make it difficult or even impossible to determine the etiology 
of the underlying process. Rheumatic AS is almost always associated 
with  involvement  of  the  mitral  valve  and  with  aortic  regurgitation 
(AR). Mediastinal radiation can also result in late scarring, fibrosis, and 
calcification of the aortic leaflets.

 ■ BICUSPID AORTIC VALVE DISEASE
A  bicuspid  aortic  valve  (BAV)  is  the  most  common  congenital  heart 
valve  defect  and  occurs  in  0.5–1.4%  of  the  population  with  a  2–4:1 
male-to-female predominance. The inheritance pattern appears to be 
autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance, although some have 
questioned an X-linked component as suggested by the prevalence of 
BAV disease among patients with Turner’s syndrome. The prevalence 
of  BAV  disease  among  first-degree  relatives  of  an  affected  individual 
is ~10%. A single gene defect to explain the majority of cases has not 
been  identified,  although  mutations  in  the  NOTCH1,  GATA5,  and 
GATA4 genes have been described in some families. Abnormalities in 
endothelial nitric oxide synthase and NKX2.5 have been implicated as 
well. Medial degeneration with ascending aortic aneurysm formation 
occurs commonly among patients with BAV disease; aortic coarctation 
is less frequently encountered. Patients with BAV disease have larger 
aortas than patients with comparable tricuspid aortic valve disease. The 
aortopathy develops independently of the hemodynamic severity of the 
valve lesion, but directional shear forces dictated by the anatomic con-
figuration of the valve appear to influence its expression. For example, 
enlargement of the ascending aorta along its greater curvature is most 
often associated with right-left cusp fusion, the most common bicuspid 
variant.  Patients  with  BAV  disease  are  at  risk  for  aneurysm  forma-
tion and/or dissection. A BAV can be a component of more complex 
congenital  heart  disease  with  or  without  other  left  heart  obstructing 
lesions, as seen in Shone’s complex.

 ■ OTHER FORMS OF OBSTRUCTION TO LEFT 
VENTRICULAR OUTFLOW
In addition to valvular AS, three other lesions may be responsible for 
obstruction  to  LV  outflow:  hypertrophic  obstructive  cardiomyopathy 
(Chap.  259),  discrete  fibromuscular/membranous  subaortic  stenosis,

and supravalvular AS (Chap. 269). The causes of LV outflow obstruc-
tion can be differentiated on the basis of the cardiac examination and 
Doppler echocardiographic findings.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The  obstruction  to  LV  outflow  produces  a  systolic  pressure  gradient 
between  the  LV  and  aorta.  When  severe  obstruction  is  suddenly  pro-
duced  experimentally,  the  LV  responds  by  dilation  and  reduction  of 
stroke volume. However, in some patients, the obstruction may be pres-
ent at birth and/or increase gradually over the course of many years, and 
LV contractile performance is maintained by the presence of concentric 
LV hypertrophy. Initially, this serves as an adaptive mechanism because it 
reduces toward normal the systolic stress developed by the myocardium, 
as predicted by the Laplace relation (S =  Pr/h, where S = systolic wall 
stress, P = pressure, r = radius, and h = wall thickness). A large transaor-
tic valve pressure gradient may exist for many years without a reduction 
in cardiac output (CO) or the development of LV dilation. Ultimately, 
however, excessive hypertrophy becomes maladaptive, LV systolic func-
tion declines because of afterload mismatch, abnormalities of diastolic 
function progress, and irreversible myocardial fibrosis develops.

A  mean  systolic  pressure  gradient  >40  mmHg  with  a  normal  CO 
or an effective aortic orifice area of ~<1 cm2 (or ~<0.6 cm2/m2 body 
surface  area  in  a  normal-sized  adult)—i.e.,  less  than  approximately 
one-third  of  the  normal  orifice  area—is  generally  considered  to  rep-
resent severe obstruction to LV outflow. The elevated LV end-diastolic 
pressure observed in many patients with severe AS and preserved ejec-
tion fraction (EF) signifies the presence of diminished compliance of 
the hypertrophied LV. Although the CO at rest is within normal limits 

in most patients with severe AS, it usually fails to rise normally during 
exercise.  Loss  of  an  appropriately  timed,  vigorous  atrial  contraction, 
as  occurs  in  atrial  fibrillation  (AF)  or  atrioventricular  dissociation, 
may  cause  rapid  progression  of  symptoms.  Late  in  the  course,  con-
tractile function deteriorates because of afterload excess, the CO and 
LV–aortic  pressure  gradient  decline,  and  the  mean  left  atrial  (LA), 
pulmonary artery (PA), and right ventricular (RV) pressures rise. LV 
performance can be further compromised by superimposed epicardial 
coronary  artery  disease  (CAD).  Stroke  volume  (and  thus  CO)  can 
also  be  reduced  in  patients  with  significant  hypertrophy  and  a  small 
LV cavity despite a normal EF. Low-flow (defined as a stroke volume 
index <35 mL/m2), low-gradient (defined as a mean pressure gradient 
<40 mmHg) AS (with either reduced or normal LV systolic function) 
is both a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

The  hypertrophied  LV  causes  an  increase  in  myocardial  oxygen 
requirements.  In  addition,  even  in  the  absence  of  obstructive  CAD, 
coronary  blood  flow  is  impaired  to  the  extent  that  ischemia  can  be 
precipitated  under  conditions  of  excess  demand.  Capillary  density  is 
reduced  relative  to  wall  thickness,  compressive  forces  are  increased, 
and the elevated LV end-diastolic pressure reduces the coronary driv-
ing pressure. The subendocardium is especially vulnerable to ischemia 
by this mechanism.
 ■ SYMPTOMS
AS is rarely of clinical importance until the valve orifice has narrowed 
to ~1 cm2. Even severe AS may exist for many years without produc-
ing  any  symptoms  because  of  the  ability  of  the  hypertrophied  LV  to 
generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a

normal stroke volume. Once symptoms occur, or the LV ejection frac-
tion falls below normal, valve replacement is indicated.

Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increas-
ing obstruction over years but do not become symptomatic until the 
sixth  to  eighth  decades.  Adult  patients  with  BAV  disease,  however, 
develop  significant  valve  dysfunction  and  symptoms  one  to  two 
decades sooner. Exertional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are 
the three cardinal symptoms. Often, there is a history of insidious pro-
gression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual curtailment of 
activities and reduced effort tolerance. Dyspnea results primarily from 
elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of 
LV  diastolic  pressures  secondary  to  impaired  relaxation  and  reduced 
LV  compliance.  Angina  pectoris  usually  develops  somewhat  later 
and  reflects  an  imbalance  between  the  increased  myocardial  oxygen 
requirements  and  reduced  oxygen  availability.  CAD  may  or  may  not 
be present, although its coexistence is common among AS patients age 
>65. Exertional syncope may result from a decline in arterial pressure 
caused by vasodilation in exercising muscles and inadequate vasocon-
striction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a 
sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Because the CO at rest is usually well maintained until late in the 
course,  marked  fatigability,  weakness,  peripheral  cyanosis,  cachexia, 
and  other  clinical  manifestations  of  a  low  CO  are  usually  not  prom-
inent  until  this  stage  is  reached.  Orthopnea,  paroxysmal  nocturnal 
dyspnea,  and  pulmonary  edema,  i.e.,  symptoms  of  LV  failure,  also 
occur  only  in  the  advanced  stages  of  the  disease.  Severe  pulmonary 
hypertension leading to RV failure and systemic venous hypertension, 
hepatomegaly,  AF,  and  tricuspid  regurgitation  (TR)  are  usually  late 
findings in patients with isolated severe AS.

When  AS  and  mitral  stenosis  (MS)  coexist,  the  reduction  in  flow 
(CO) caused by MS lowers the pressure gradient across the aortic valve 
and, thereby, masks many of the clinical findings produced by AS. The 
transaortic  pressure  gradient  can  be  increased  in  patients  with  con-
comitant AR due to higher aortic valve flow rates.
 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
The heart rhythm is generally regular until late in the course; at other 
times, AF should suggest the possibility of associated mitral valve disease. 
Hypertension occurs commonly among older adults with AS. In the late 
stages, however, when stroke volume declines, the systolic pressure may 
fall and the pulse pressure narrow. The carotid arterial pulse rises slowly 
to a delayed peak (pulsus parvus et tardus). A thrill or anacrotic “shud-
der” may be palpable over the carotid arteries, more commonly the left. 
In the elderly, the stiffening of the arterial wall may mask this important 
physical sign. In many patients, the a wave in the jugular venous pulse 
is accentuated. This results from the diminished distensibility of the RV 
cavity caused by the bulging, hypertrophied interventricular septum.

The LV impulse is sometimes displaced laterally in the later stages 
of  the  disease.  A  double  apical  impulse  (with  a  palpable  S4)  may  be 
appreciated, particularly with the patient in the left lateral recumbent 
position. A systolic thrill may be present at the base of the heart to the 
right of the sternum when leaning forward or in the suprasternal notch.
Auscultation  An early systolic ejection sound is frequently audible 
in  children,  adolescents,  and  young  adults  with  congenital  BAV  dis-
ease. This sound usually disappears when the valve becomes calcified 
and  rigid.  As  AS  increases  in  severity,  LV  systole  may  become  pro-
longed so that the aortic valve closure sound no longer precedes the 
pulmonic valve closure sound, and the two components may become 
synchronous, or aortic valve closure may even follow pulmonic valve 
closure,  causing  paradoxical  splitting  of  S2  (Chap.  239).  The  sound 
of aortic valve closure can be heard most frequently in patients with 
AS who have pliable valves, and calcification diminishes the intensity 
of this sound. Frequently, an S4 is audible at the apex and reflects the 
presence of LV hypertrophy and an elevated LV end-diastolic pressure; 
an S3 generally occurs late in the course, when the LV dilates and its 
systolic function becomes severely compromised.

The murmur of AS is described as an ejection (mid) systolic murmur 
that commences shortly after the S1, increases in intensity to reach a peak 
toward the middle of ejection, and ends just before aortic valve closure. It is 

characteristically low-pitched, rough, and rasping in character, and loudest 
at the base of the heart, most commonly in the second right intercostal 
space. It is transmitted upward along the carotid arteries. Occasionally it 
is transmitted downward and to the apex, where it may be confused with 
the systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation (MR) (Gallavardin effect). In 
almost all patients with severe obstruction and preserved CO, the murmur 
is at least grade III/VI. In patients with mild degrees of obstruction or in 
those  with  severe  stenosis  with  heart  failure  and  low  CO  in  whom  the 
stroke volume and, therefore, the transvalvular flow rate are reduced, the 
murmur may be relatively soft and brief.
 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
ECG 
In  most  patients  with  severe  AS,  there  is  LV  hypertrophy.  In 
advanced  cases,  ST-segment  depression  and  T-wave  inversion  (LV 
“strain”) in standard leads I and aVL and in the left precordial leads are 
evident. However, there is no close correlation between the ECG and the 
hemodynamic severity of obstruction, and the absence of ECG signs of 
LV hypertrophy does not exclude severe obstruction. Systemic hyperten-
sion can coexist and also contribute to the development of hypertrophy.
Echocardiogram  The  key  findings  on  transthoracic  echocardio-
gram are thickening, calcification, and reduced systolic opening of the 
valve leaflets and LV hypertrophy. Eccentric closure of the aortic valve 
cusps is characteristic of congenitally bicuspid valves. Transesophageal 
echocardiography imaging can display the obstructed orifice extremely 
well, but it is not routinely required for accurate characterization of AS. 
The valve gradient and aortic valve area can be estimated by Doppler 
measurement of the transaortic velocity. Severe AS is defined by a valve 
area <1 cm2, whereas moderate AS is defined by a valve area of 1–1.5 cm2  
and mild AS by a valve area of 1.5–2 cm2. Aortic valve sclerosis, con-
versely,  is  accompanied  by  a  jet  velocity  of  <2.5  m/s  (peak  gradient  
<25  mmHg).  LV  dilation  and  reduced  systolic  shortening  reflect 
impairment of LV function. There is a robust experience with the use 
of  longitudinal  strain  to  characterize  earlier  changes  in  LV  systolic 
function, before a decline in EF can be appreciated. Doppler indices of 
impaired diastolic function are frequently seen.

Echocardiography  is  useful  for  identifying  coexisting  valvular 
abnormalities,  differentiating  valvular  AS  from  other  forms  of  LV 
outflow  obstruction,  and  measuring  the  aortic  root  and  proximal 
ascending  aortic  dimensions.  These  aortic  measurements  are  partic-
ularly  important  for  patients  with  BAV  disease.  Dobutamine  stress 
echocardiography is useful for the evaluation of patients with AS and 
severe LV systolic dysfunction (low-flow, low-gradient, severe AS with 
reduced EF), in whom the severity of the AS can often be difficult to 
judge. Patients with severe AS (i.e., valve area <1 cm2) with a relatively 
low mean gradient (<40 mmHg) despite a normal EF (low-flow, low-
gradient, severe AS with normal EF) are often hypertensive, and efforts 
to  control  their  systemic  blood  pressure  should  be  optimized  before 
Doppler echocardiography is repeated. The use of dobutamine stress 
echocardiography in this setting is generally not advised. When there 
is continued uncertainty regarding the severity of AS in patients with 
reduced CO, quantitative analysis of the amount of aortic valve calcium 
with chest computed tomography (CT) can be helpful. There is increas-
ing  use  of  chest  CT  angiography  to  assess  aortic  valve  morphology 
and function. It has become the imaging method of choice to plan for 
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Finally, the use of car-
diac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to screen for the presence of 
myocardial fibrosis with late gadolinium enhancement in patients with 
severe AS is an area of active investigation.

Chest X-Ray  The chest x-ray may show no or little overall cardiac 
enlargement for many years. Hypertrophy without dilation may pro-
duce some rounding of the cardiac apex in the frontal projection and 
slight  backward  displacement  in  the  lateral  view.  A  dilated  proximal 
ascending aorta may be seen along the upper right heart border in the 
frontal view. Aortic valve calcification may be discernible in the lateral 
view,  but  it  is  usually  readily  apparent  on  fluoroscopic  examination 
or  by  echocardiography;  the  absence  of  valvular  calcification  on  flu-
oroscopy  in  an  adult  suggests  that  severe  valvular  AS  is  not  present. 
In  later  stages  of  the  disease,  as  the  LV  dilates,  there  is  increasing

1982 roentgenographic evidence of LV enlargement, pulmonary congestion, 
and enlargement of the LA, PA, and right-sided heart chambers.

Catheterization  Right-  and  left-sided  heart  catheterization  for 
invasive assessment of AS is performed infrequently but can be useful 
when there is a discrepancy between the clinical and noninvasive find-
ings. Concern has been raised that attempts to cross the aortic valve 
for measurement of LV pressures are associated with a risk of cerebral 
embolization. Catheterization can also be useful in three distinct cat-
egories  of  patients:  (1)  patients  with  multivalvular  disease,  in  whom 
the role played by each valvular deformity should be defined to aid in 
the planning of operative treatment; (2) young, asymptomatic patients 
with  noncalcific  congenital  AS,  to  define  the  severity  of  obstruction 
to LV outflow, because operation or percutaneous aortic balloon val-
vuloplasty  (PABV)  may  be  indicated  in  these  patients  if  severe  AS  is 
present, even in the absence of symptoms; and (3) patients in whom it 
is suspected that the obstruction to LV outflow may not be at the level of 
the aortic valve but rather at the sub- or supravalvular level.

Coronary angiography is indicated to screen for CAD in appropriate 
patients with severe AS who are being considered for surgical or tran-
scatheter valve intervention. Angiography can be performed invasively 
at  the  time  of  catheterization  for  hemodynamic  assessment  or  with 
noninvasive  CT  techniques.  Decision-making  regarding  the  need  for 
coronary artery revascularization at the time of aortic valve interven-
tion is individualized.
 ■ NATURAL HISTORY
Death in patients with severe AS occurs most commonly in the seventh 
and eighth decades. Based on data obtained at postmortem examination 
in patients before surgical treatment became widely available, the aver-
age time to death after the onset of various symptoms was as follows: 
angina pectoris, 3 years; syncope, 3 years; dyspnea, 2 years; heart failure, 
1.5–2 years. Moreover, in >80% of patients who died with AS, symptoms 
had existed for <4 years. Among adults dying with valvular AS, sudden 
death,  which  presumably  resulted  from  an  arrhythmia,  occurred  in 
10–20%;  however,  most  sudden  deaths  occurred  in  patients  who  had 
previously been symptomatic. Sudden death as the first manifestation 
of severe AS is very uncommon (~1% per year) in asymptomatic adult 
patients. Calcific AS is a progressive disease, with an annual reduction 
in valve area averaging 0.1 cm2 and annual increases in peak jet velocity 
and mean valve gradient averaging 0.3 m/s and 7 mmHg, respectively.

Aortic Stenosis (Fig. 261-4) 

MEDICAL TREATMENT
In patients with severe AS (valve area <1 cm2), strenuous physical 
activity  and  competitive  sports  should  be  avoided,  even  in  the 
asymptomatic stage. Care must be taken to avoid dehydration and 
hypovolemia to protect against a significant reduction in CO. Med-
ications used for the treatment of hypertension or CAD, including 
beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 
are generally safe for asymptomatic patients with preserved LV sys-
tolic function. Nitroglycerin is helpful in relieving angina pectoris 
in  patients  with  CAD.  Neither  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitors 
(“statins”) nor inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone sys-
tem slow the rate of progression of AS. The use of statin medications 
should be driven by considerations regarding primary and second-
ary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) 
events.  The  need  for  endocarditis  prophylaxis  is  restricted  to  AS 
patients with a prior history of endocarditis. 

SURGICAL TREATMENT
Asymptomatic  patients  with  calcific  AS  and  severe  obstruction 
should  be  followed  carefully  for  the  development  of  symptoms 
and  by  serial  echocardiograms  for  evidence  of  deteriorating  LV 
function. Operation is indicated in patients with severe AS (valve 
area <1 cm2 or 0.6 cm2/m2 body surface area) who are symptomatic, 
those  who  exhibit  LV  systolic  dysfunction  (EF  <50%),  and  those 

with AS due to BAV disease and an aneurysmal root or ascending 
aorta  (maximal  dimension  >5.5  cm).  Operation  for  aneurysm 
disease  is  recommended  at  smaller  aortic  diameters  (4.5–5.0  cm) 
for  patients  with  a  family  history  of  an  aortic  catastrophe  and 
for  patients  who  exhibit  rapid  aneurysm  growth  (>0.5  cm/year). 
Patients with asymptomatic moderate or severe AS who are referred 
for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery should also have AVR. 
In patients without heart failure, the operative risk of surgical AVR 
(SAVR) (including patients with AS or AR) is ~2% (Table 261-2) 
but  increases  as  a  function  of  age  and  the  need  for  concomitant 
aortic or other heart valve surgery or coronary bypass grafting. The 
indications  for  SAVR  in  the  asymptomatic  patient  have  been  the 
subject of intense debate, as surgical outcomes in selected patients 
have continued to improve. Relative indications for which surgery 
can  be  considered  include  an  abnormal  response  to  treadmill 
exercise; rapid progression of AS, especially when urgent access to 
medical care might be compromised; very severe AS, defined by an 
aortic valve jet velocity >5 m/s or mean gradient >60 mmHg and 
low operative risk; and excessive LV hypertrophy in the absence of 
systemic hypertension. Exercise testing can be safely performed in 
asymptomatic  patients,  as  many  as  one-third  of  whom  will  show 
signs of functional impairment. In a small randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) of early surgery versus conservative care for asymptom-
atic patients with very severe AS (defined by a transaortic valve jet 
velocity ≥4.5 m/s, mean gradient ≥50 mmHg, or aortic valve area 
≤0.75 cm2), the rate of operative death or death from cardiovascu-
lar causes during follow-up was reduced with early surgery. In the 
conservative care group, the cumulative incidence of sudden death 
was 4% at 4 years and 14% at 8 years.

Operation  should  be  carried  out  promptly  (1–3  months)  after 
symptom  onset.  Clinical  decision-making  is  straightforward  for 
patients with normal flow (>35 mL/m2), high gradient (≥40 mmHg) 
severe AS. In patients with low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with 
reduced LVEF, perioperative mortality rates are high (15–20%), and 
evidence of LV dysfunction usually persists even after a technically 
successful  operation.  Long-term  postoperative  survival  correlates 
with  preoperative  LV  function.  Nonetheless,  in  view  of  the  even 
worse prognosis of such patients when they are treated medically, 
there is usually little choice but to advise valve replacement, espe-
cially  in  patients  in  whom  flow  reserve  can  be  demonstrated  by 
dobutamine stress echocardiography (defined by a ≥20% increase 
in stroke volume after dobutamine challenge). Patients in this high 
surgical risk group are usually treated with TAVI (see below), but 
robust data from RCTs in this subpopulation of severe AS patients 
are lacking. The management of patients with low-flow, low-gradi-
ent severe AS with normal LVEF is also challenging. Outcomes are 
improved with surgery or TAVI compared with conservative med-
ical  care  for  symptomatic  patients  with  this  type  of  “paradoxical” 
low-flow AS, but more research is needed to guide therapeutic deci-
sion making for individual patients. In patients in whom severe AS 
and CAD coexist, relief of the AS and revascularization may some-
times result in striking clinical and hemodynamic improvement.

Because  many  patients  with  calcific  AS  are  elderly,  particular 
attention  must  be  directed  to  the  adequacy  of  hepatic,  renal,  and 
pulmonary function before AVR is recommended. Age alone is not 
a  contraindication  to  SAVR  for  AS.  The  perioperative  mortality 
rate  depends  to  a  substantial  extent  on  the  patient’s  preoperative 
clinical and hemodynamic state. Assessment of frailty is a critical 
component  of  preprocedural  evaluation.  Treatment  decisions  for 
AS patients who are not at low operative risk are made by a mul-
tidisciplinary  heart  team  with  representation  from  general  cardi-
ology,  interventional  cardiology,  multimodality  imaging,  cardiac 
surgery,  and  other  subspecialties  as  needed,  including  geriatrics. 
The 10-year survival rate of older adult patients with SAVR is ~60%. 
Recommendations regarding the type of valve prosthesis (biological 
or mechanical) must weigh the trade-offs between limited biopros-
thetic valve durability and the risks of thromboembolism and bleed-
ing with a mechanical valve and are heavily influenced by patient 
age and preferences. Bioprostheses are generally favored for patients

FIGURE 261-4  Management strategy for patients with aortic stenosis. Preoperative coronary angiography should be performed routinely as determined by age, symptoms, 
and coronary risk factors. Cardiac catheterization and angiography may also be helpful when there is a discrepancy between clinical and noninvasive findings. Patients who 
do not meet criteria for intervention should be monitored with clinical and echocardiographic follow-up. The class designations refer to the American Heart Association/
American College of Cardiology methodology for treatment recommendations. Class I recommendations should be performed or are indicated; Class IIa recommendations 
are considered reasonable to perform; Class IIb recommendations may be considered. The stages refer to the stages of progression of the disease. At disease stage A, risk 
factors are present for the development of valve dysfunction; stage B refers to progressive, mild-moderate, asymptomatic valve disease; stage C disease is severe in nature 
but clinically asymptomatic; stage C1 characterizes asymptomatic patients with severe valve disease but compensated ventricular function; stage C2 refers to asymptomatic, 
severe disease with ventricular decompensation; stage D refers to severe, symptomatic valve disease. With aortic stenosis, stage D1 refers to symptomatic patients with 
severe aortic stenosis and a high valve gradient (>40 mmHg mean gradient); stage D2 comprises patients with symptomatic, severe, low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis 
and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); and stage D3 characterizes patients with symptomatic, severe, low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and preserved left 
ventricular ejection fraction (paradoxical, low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis). Patients with symptomatic severe AS (left side of the diagram, jet velocity ≥4m/s) 
should be referred for AVR (SAVR or TAVI). Asymptomatic patients with severe AS (jet velocity ≥4m/s) should be referred for AVR (SAVR or TAVI) for LVEF <50% or when 
other cardiac surgery is needed (e.g., aneurysm repair). There are several findings for which referral for AVR would be reasonable related to results of exercise testing, the

valve  with  the  autologous  pulmonic  valve  and  implantation  of  a 
homograft in the native pulmonic position. It is a technically com-
plex  procedure  that  may  be  considered  in  young  or  middle-aged 
adult  patients  when  surgical  and  institutional  expertise  are  avail-
able. Late postoperative complications include aortic root dilation, 
AR, and pulmonary homograft stenosis.

PERCUTANEOUS AORTIC BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY
This  procedure  is  preferable  to  operation  in  many  children  and 
young adults with congenital, noncalcific AS (Chap. 269). It is not 
recommended as definitive therapy in adults with severe calcific AS 
because of a very high restenosis rate (80% within 1 year) and the 
risk of procedural complications, but on occasion, it has been used 
successfully as a bridge to operation or TAVI in patients with severe 
LV dysfunction and shock. It is performed routinely as part of the 
TAVI procedure (see below). 
TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE IMPLANTATION
TAVI surpassed SAVR for treatment of AS in the United States in 2016 
and is now available to symptomatic patients across the entire surgical 
risk spectrum (prohibitive, high, intermediate, and low) on the basis of 
the favorable results seen in a series of landmark RCTs reported over 
the past decade (Fig. 261-5). Application of TAVI in asymptomatic AS 
patients is under active investigation. It is most commonly performed 
using  one  of  two  systems,  a  balloon-expandable  valve  or  a  self-
expanding valve, both of which incorporate a pericardial bioprosthesis 
(Fig. 261-6). TAVI is most frequently undertaken via the transfemoral 
route,  although  trans-LV  apical,  subclavian,  carotid,  and  ascending 
aortic routes have been used. Aortic balloon valvuloplasty under rapid 
RV (or LV) pacing is performed as a first step to create an orifice of 
sufficient size for the prosthesis. Procedural success rates exceed 95% 
in  appropriately  selected  patients.  Valve  performance  characteristics 
are excellent over 5 years; longer-term durability assessment is ongoing. 
Outcomes  achieved  with  this  transformative  technology  have  been 
very  favorable  and  have  allowed  the  extension  of  AVR  to  groups  of 
patients previously considered at high or prohibitive risk for conven-
tional  surgery.  Nevertheless,  some  prohibitive  or  high  surgical  risk 
patients are not candidates for this procedure because their comorbid-
ity profile and frailty would make its undertaking inappropriate. The 
heart team is specifically charged with making challenging decisions 
of this nature. The use of these devices for treatment of patients with 
structural  deterioration  of  bioprosthetic  aortic  valves  (valve-in-valve 
TAVI), as an alternative to reoperative valve replacement, has increased 
sharply over the past 5 years. The technology has also been increasingly 
applied to BAV patients despite the fact that patients with this anatomy 
were excluded from the landmark RCTs.

Compared with SAVR, transfemoral TAVI results in fewer peripro-
cedural deaths and confers lower risks of strokes, major bleeding, and 
AF. Hospital lengths of stay are shorter and return to normal activity 
more  rapid  with  TAVI.  Rates  of  permanent  pacemaker  use,  peri-
valvular AR, and vascular complications are lower with SAVR. The 
choice between TAVI and SAVR for patients with trileaflet AS who 
prefer a biological prosthesis rests on several clinical, imaging, and 
technical considerations (Fig. 261-7 and Table 261-3). Because there

FIGURE 261-7  Choice of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) versus transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) when indications for aortic valve 
replacement are met. For patients who are not prohibitive or high surgical risk candidates, TAVI is not recommended for patients age <65 years (left hand side of flow 
diagram). For prohibitive or high surgical risk patients, TAVI is preferred over SAVR but is recommended on an individual basis only after multidisciplinary heart team 
consensus decision-making in collaboration with the patient and family. Palliative care is recommended when TAVI is considered futile (right side of flow diagram). AS, aortic 
stenosis; AVR, aortic valve replacement; EF, ejection fraction; QOL, quality of life; STS, Society of Thoracic Surgeons; VKA, vitamin K antagonist. *Approximate ages, based 
on US Actuarial Life Expectancy tables, are provided for guidance. The balance between expected patient longevity and valve durability varies continuously across the age 
range, with more durable valves preferred for patients with a longer life expectancy. Bioprosthetic valve durability is finite (with shorter durability for younger patients), 
whereas mechanical valves are very durable but require lifelong anticoagulation. Long-term (20-y) data on outcomes with surgical bioprosthetic valves are available; robust 
data on transcatheter bioprosthetic valves extend to only 5 years, leading to uncertainty about longer-term outcomes. The decision about valve type should be individualized 
on the basis of patient-specific factors that might affect longevity. †Placement of a transcatheter valve requires vascular anatomy that allows transfemoral delivery and the 
absence of aortic root dilation that would require surgical replacement. Valvular anatomy must be suitable for placement on the specific prosthetic valve, including annulus 
size and shape, leaflet number and calcification, and ostial height. (Reproduced with permission from CM Otto et al: 2020 AHA/ACC Guideline for management of patients 
with valvular heart disease: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines. Circulation 143:e72, 2021.)

are scant RCT data on TAVI outcomes in patients <65 years, SAVR is 
recommended in this age group. Aortic valve/root anatomy, as well 
as the extent, severity, and distribution of calcium, and the distance 
of the coronary arteries from the plane of the annulus, may dictate 
a  surgical  approach,  as  could  the  need  to  perform  a  concomitant 

procedure  such  as  ascending  aortic  replacement.  Lastly,  inability 
to  achieve  transfemoral  access  is  a  relative  impediment  to  TAVI 
given the higher complication rates observed when this procedure is 
undertaken from other vascular access sites.

262 Aortic Regurgitation

Patrick T. O’Gara, Joseph Loscalzo

 ■ ETIOLOGY
(Table  262-1)  Aortic  regurgitation  (AR)  may  be  caused  by  primary 
valve disease, aortic root disease, or their combination.

Primary  Valve  Disease  Rheumatic  disease  results  in  thicken-
ing,  deformity,  and  shortening  of  the  individual  aortic  valve  cusps, 
changes that prevent their proper opening during systole and closure 
during diastole. A rheumatic origin is much less common in patients 
with  isolated  AR  who  do  not  have  associated  rheumatic  mitral  valve 
disease.  Patients  with  congenital  bicuspid  aortic  valve  (BAV)  disease 
may develop predominant AR, and ~20% of these patients will require 
aortic  valve  surgery  between  10  and  40  years  of  age.  Congenital

fenestrations of the aortic valve occasionally produce mild AR. Mem-
branous  subaortic  stenosis  results  in  a  high  velocity  systolic  jet  that 
often leads to thickening and scarring of the aortic valve leaflets and 
secondary  AR.  Prolapse  of  an  aortic  cusp,  resulting  in  progressive 
chronic AR, occurs in ~15% of patients with ventricular septal defect 
(Chap. 269),  but  may  also  occur  as  an  isolated  phenomenon  or  as  a 
consequence of myxomatous degeneration sometimes associated with 
mitral and/or tricuspid valve involvement.

AR may result from infective endocarditis (IE), which can develop 
on  a  valve  previously  affected  by  rheumatic  disease,  a  congenitally 
deformed  valve,  or  on  a  normal  aortic  valve,  and  may  lead  to  per-
foration  or  erosion  of  one  or  more  leaflets.  The  aortic  valve  leaflets 
may  become  scarred  and  retracted  during  the  course  of  syphilis  or 
ankylosing  spondylitis  and  contribute  further  to  the  AR  that  derives 
primarily from the associated root dilation. Although traumatic rup-
ture or avulsion of an aortic cusp is an uncommon cause of acute AR, 
it  represents  the  most  frequent  serious  lesion  in  patients  surviving 
nonpenetrating cardiac injuries. The coexistence of hemodynamically 
significant aortic stenosis (AS) with AR usually excludes all the rarer 
forms of AR because it occurs almost exclusively in patients with rheu-
matic or congenital AR. In patients with AR due to primary valvular 
disease, dilation of the aortic annulus may occur secondarily and lead 
to worsening regurgitation.
Primary  Aortic  Root  Disease  AR  also  may  be  due  entirely  to 
marked  aortic  annular  dilation,  i.e.,  aortic  root  disease,  without  pri-
mary involvement of the valve leaflets; widening of the aortic annulus 
and  lack  of  diastolic  coaptation  of  the  aortic  leaflets  are  responsible 
for the AR (Chap. 280). Medial degeneration of the ascending aorta, 
which may or may not be associated with other manifestations of Mar-
fan  syndrome;  idiopathic  dilation  of  the  aorta;  annuloaortic  ectasia; 
osteogenesis  imperfecta;  and  severe,  chronic  hypertension  may  all 
widen  the  aortic  annulus  and  lead  to  progressive  AR.  Occasionally 
AR is caused by retrograde dissection of the aorta involving the aortic 
annulus. Syphilis and ankylosing spondylitis, both of which may also 
affect the aortic leaflets, may be associated with cellular infiltration and 
scarring of the media of the thoracic aorta, leading to aortic dilation, 
aneurysm formation, and severe regurgitation. In syphilis of the aorta 
(Chap. 182), now a very rare condition, the involvement of the intima 
may narrow the coronary ostia, which in turn may be responsible for 
myocardial ischemia. Takayasu’s aortitis and giant cell aortitis can also 
result in aneurysm formation and secondary AR.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The total stroke volume ejected by the left ventricle (LV) (i.e., the sum 
of  the  effective  forward  stroke  volume  and  the  volume  of  blood  that

regurgitates  back  into  the  LV)  is  increased  in  patients  with  AR.  In 
patients with severe AR, the volume of regurgitant flow may equal the 
effective forward stroke volume. In contrast to MR, in which a portion 
of the LV stroke volume is delivered into the low-pressure left atrium 
(LA), in AR, the entire LV stroke volume is ejected into a high-pressure 
zone, the aorta. An increase in the LV end-diastolic volume (increased 
preload)  constitutes  the  major  hemodynamic  compensation  for  AR. 
The dilation and eccentric hypertrophy of the LV allow this chamber 
to  eject  a  larger  stroke  volume  without  requiring  any  increase  in  the 
relative shortening of each myofibril. Therefore, severe AR may occur 
with a normal effective forward stroke volume and a normal LV ejec-
tion  fraction  (LVEF,  total  [forward  plus  regurgitant]  stroke  volume/
end-diastolic  volume),  together  with  an  elevated  LV  end-diastolic 
pressure and volume. However, through the operation of Laplace’s law, 
LV dilation increases the LV systolic tension required to develop any 
given level of systolic pressure. Chronic AR is, thus, a state in which 
LV preload and afterload are both increased. Ultimately, these adaptive 
measures  fail.  As  LV  function  deteriorates,  the  end-diastolic  volume 
rises further and the forward stroke volume and ejection fraction (EF) 
decline. Deterioration of LV function often precedes the development 
of symptoms. Considerable thickening of the LV wall also occurs with 
chronic AR, and at autopsy, the hearts of these patients may be among 
the largest encountered, sometimes weighing >1000 g.

The  reverse  diastolic  pressure  gradient  from  aorta  to  LV,  which 
drives the AR flow, falls progressively during diastole, accounting for 
the typical decrescendo nature of the diastolic murmur. Equilibration 
between aortic and LV pressures may occur toward the end of diastole 
in patients with chronic severe AR, particularly when the heart rate is 
slow.  In  patients  with  acute  severe  AR,  the  LV  is  unprepared  for  the 
regurgitant volume load. LV compliance is normal or reduced, and LV 
diastolic pressures rise rapidly, occasionally to levels >40 mmHg. The 
LV  pressure  may  exceed  the  LA  pressure  toward  the  end  of  diastole, 
and this reversed pressure gradient closes the mitral valve prematurely.
In  patients  with  chronic  severe  AR,  the  effective  forward  cardiac 
output (CO) usually is normal or only slightly reduced at rest, but often 
it fails to rise normally during exercise. An early sign of LV dysfunction 
is a reduction in the EF. In advanced stages, there may be considerable 
elevation of the LA, pulmonary artery (PA) wedge, PA, and right ven-
tricular (RV) pressures and lowering of the forward CO at rest.

Myocardial ischemia may occur in patients with AR because myocar-
dial oxygen requirements are elevated by LV dilation, hypertrophy, and 
elevated LV systolic tension, and coronary blood flow may be compro-
mised. A large fraction of coronary blood flow occurs during diastole, 
when aortic pressure is low, thereby reducing coronary perfusion or driv-
ing pressure. This combination of increased oxygen demand and reduced 
supply may cause myocardial ischemia, particularly of the subendocar-
dium, even in the absence of epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD).

 ■ HISTORY
Approximately three-fourths of patients with pure or predominant val-
vular AR are men; women predominate among patients with primary 
valvular AR who have associated rheumatic mitral valve disease. A his-
tory compatible with IE may sometimes be elicited from patients with 
rheumatic or congenital involvement of the aortic valve, and the infec-
tion often precipitates or seriously aggravates preexisting symptoms.

In patients with acute severe AR, as may occur in IE, aortic dissec-
tion,  or  trauma,  the  LV  cannot  dilate  sufficiently  to  maintain  stroke 
volume, and LV diastolic pressure rises rapidly with associated marked 
elevations  of  LA  and  PA  wedge  pressures.  Pulmonary  edema  and/or 
cardiogenic shock may develop rapidly.

Chronic severe AR may have a long latent period, and patients may 
remain relatively asymptomatic for as long as 10–15 years. Uncomfort-
able awareness of the heartbeat, especially on lying down, may be an 
early complaint. Sinus tachycardia, during exertion or with emotion, or 
premature ventricular contractions may produce particularly uncom-
fortable palpitations as well as head pounding. These complaints may 
persist for many years before the development of exertional dyspnea, 
usually the first symptom of diminished cardiac reserve. The dyspnea 
is followed by orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and excessive

1988 diaphoresis. Anginal chest pain even in the absence of CAD may occur 
in patients with severe AR, even in younger patients. Anginal pain may 
develop  at  rest  as  well  as  during  exertion.  Nocturnal  angina  may  be 
a  particularly  troublesome  symptom,  and  it  may  be  accompanied  by 
marked diaphoresis. The anginal episodes can be prolonged and often 
do not respond satisfactorily to sublingual nitroglycerin. Systemic fluid 
accumulation,  including  congestive  hepatomegaly  and  ankle  edema, 
may develop late in the course of the disease.

 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
In chronic severe AR, the jarring of the entire body and the bobbing 
motion of the head with each systole can be appreciated, and the abrupt 
distention  and  collapse  of  the  larger  arteries  are  easily  visible.  The 
examination  should  be  directed  toward  the  detection  of  conditions 
predisposing to AR, such as bicuspid valve, IE, Marfan syndrome, or 
ankylosing spondylitis.

Arterial Pulse  A rapidly rising “water-hammer” pulse, which col-
lapses suddenly as arterial pressure falls rapidly during late systole and 
diastole (Corrigan’s pulse), and capillary pulsations, an alternate flush-
ing and paling of the skin at the root of the nail while pressure is applied 
to  the  tip  of  the  nail  (Quincke’s  pulse),  are  characteristic  of  chronic 
severe AR. A booming “pistol-shot” sound can be heard over the femo-
ral arteries (Traube’s sign), and a to-and-fro murmur (Duroziez’s sign) 
is audible if the femoral artery is lightly compressed with a stethoscope.
The  arterial  pulse  pressure  is  widened  as  a  result  of  both  systolic 
hypertension  and  a  lowering  of  the  diastolic  pressure.  The  measure-
ment of arterial diastolic pressure with a sphygmomanometer may be 
complicated by the fact that systolic sounds are frequently heard with 
the cuff completely deflated. However, the level of cuff pressure at the 
time of muffling of the Korotkoff sounds (phase IV) generally corre-
sponds fairly closely to the true intra-arterial diastolic pressure. As the 
disease progresses and the LV end-diastolic pressure rises, the arterial 
diastolic pressure may actually rise as well, because the aortic diastolic 
pressure cannot fall below the LV end-diastolic pressure. For the same 
reason, acute severe AR may also be accompanied by only a slight wid-
ening of the pulse pressure. Such patients are invariably tachycardic as 
the heart rate increases in an attempt to preserve the CO.

Palpation 
In  patients  with  chronic  severe  AR,  the  LV  impulse  is 
heaving and displaced laterally and inferiorly. The systolic expansion 
and  diastolic  retraction  of  the  apex  are  prominent.  A  diastolic  thrill 
may be palpable along the left sternal border in thin-chested individu-
als, and a prominent systolic thrill may be palpable in the suprasternal 
notch and transmitted upward along the carotid arteries. This systolic 
thrill  and  the  accompanying  murmur  do  not  necessarily  signify  the 
coexistence of AS. In some patients with AR or with combined AS and 
AR, the carotid arterial pulse may be bisferiens, i.e., with two systolic 
waves separated by a trough (see Fig. 239-2C).

Auscultation 
In  patients  with  severe  AR,  the  aortic  valve  closure 
sound  (A2)  is  usually  absent.  A  systolic  ejection  sound  is  audible  in 
patients with BAV disease, and occasionally an S4 also may be heard. 
The murmur of chronic AR is typically a high-pitched, blowing, decre-
scendo diastolic murmur, heard best in the third intercostal space along 
the left sternal border (see Fig. 239-5B). In patients with mild AR, this 
murmur  is  brief,  but  as  the  severity  increases,  it  generally  becomes 
louder and longer, indeed holodiastolic. When the murmur is soft, it 
can be heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope and with the 
patient sitting up, leaning forward, and with the breath held in forced 
expiration. In patients in whom the AR is caused by primary valvular 
disease, the diastolic murmur is usually louder along the left than the 
right sternal border. However, when the murmur is louder along the 
right sternal border, it suggests that the AR is caused by aneurysmal 
dilation  of  the  aortic  root.  “Cooing”  or  musical  diastolic  murmurs 
suggest eversion of an aortic cusp vibrating in the regurgitant stream.

A  mid-systolic  ejection  murmur  is  frequently  audible  in  isolated 
AR. It is generally heard best at the base of the heart and is transmitted 
along the carotid arteries. This murmur may be quite loud without sig-
nifying aortic valve obstruction. A third murmur sometimes heard in 

patients with severe AR is the Austin Flint murmur, a soft, low-pitched, 
rumbling mid-to-late diastolic murmur. It is probably produced by the 
diastolic displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the 
AR  stream  and  is  not  associated  with  hemodynamically  significant 
mitral valve obstruction. The auscultatory features of AR are intensi-
fied  by  strenuous  and  sustained  handgrip,  which  augments  systemic 
vascular resistance and increases LV afterload.

In acute severe AR, the elevation of LV end-diastolic pressure may 
lead to early closure of the mitral valve, a soft S1, a pulse pressure that 
is not particularly wide, and a soft, short, early diastolic murmur of AR.
 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
ECG 
In patients with chronic severe AR, ECG signs of LV hyper-
trophy are common (Chap. 240). In addition, these patients frequently 
exhibit ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion in leads I, aVL, 
V5, and V6 (“LV strain”). Left axis deviation and/or QRS prolongation 
may also be present.

Echocardiogram  LV size is increased in chronic AR, and systolic 
function is normal or even supernormal until myocardial contractility 
declines, as signaled by a decrease in EF or increase in the end-systolic 
dimension. A rapid, high-frequency diastolic fluttering of the anterior 
mitral leaflet produced by the impact of the regurgitant jet is a char-
acteristic  finding.  The  echocardiogram  is  also  useful  in  determining 
the cause of AR, by detecting dilation of the aortic annulus and root, 
aortic dissection (see Fig. 241-5), or primary leaflet pathology. With 
severe AR, the central jet width assessed by color flow Doppler imaging 
exceeds 65% of the width of the LV outflow tract, the regurgitant vol-
ume is ≥60 mL/beat, the regurgitant fraction is ≥50%, and there is dia-
stolic flow reversal in the proximal portion of the descending thoracic 
aorta. The continuous-wave Doppler profile of the AR jet shows a rapid 
deceleration  time  in  patients  with  acute  severe  AR,  due  to  the  rapid 
increase  in  LV  diastolic  pressure.  Surveillance  transthoracic  echocar-
diography (TTE) forms the cornerstone of longitudinal follow-up and 
allows  for  the  early  detection  of  changes  in  LV  size  and/or  function. 
For patients in whom TTE is limited by poor acoustical windows or 
inadequate characterization of LV function or the cause or severity of 
the regurgitation, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can be 
performed. This modality also allows for accurate assessment of aortic 
size  and  contour.  It  can  also  be  utilized  to  screen  for  LV  fibrosis  as 
assessed with late gadolinium enhancement. Both CMR imaging and 
cardiac  computed  tomography  (CT)  can  provide  detailed  assessment 
of  aortic  valve  and  root  anatomy.  Transesophageal  echocardiography 
(TEE) can also provide detailed anatomic assessment of the valve, root, 
and portions of the aorta. There is increasing experience with the use of 
three-dimensional echocardiography to measure LV volumes.

Chest X-Ray 
In chronic severe AR, the apex is displaced downward 
and to the left in the frontal projection. In the left anterior oblique and 
lateral projections, the LV is displaced posteriorly and encroaches on 
the  spine.  When  AR  is  caused  by  primary  disease  of  the  aortic  root, 
aneurysmal  dilation  of  the  aorta  may  be  noted,  and  the  aorta  may 
fill the retrosternal space in the lateral view. Echocardiography, CMR 
imaging, and chest CT angiography are more sensitive than the chest 
x-ray for the detection of root and ascending aortic enlargement.

Cardiac  Catheterization  and  Angiography  When  needed, 
right and left heart catheterization with contrast aortography can pro-
vide confirmation of the magnitude of regurgitation and the status of 
LV function. Coronary angiography is performed routinely in appro-
priate patients prior to surgery, although this anatomic information can 
also be gained with coronary CT angiographic techniques.

LV dysfunction, or other indications for operation (e.g., aneurysm disease). Surgery is also reasonable once the LV indexed end-systolic dimension reaches or exceeds 25 mm/

usually short-lived and operation is indicated urgently. Intra-aortic 
balloon counterpulsation is contraindicated. Beta blockers are best 
avoided so as not to reduce the CO further or slow the heart rate, 
thus  allowing  more  time  for  diastolic  filling  of  the  LV.  Surgery  is 
the  treatment  of  choice  and  is  usually  necessary  within  24  h  of   
diagnosis. 

CHRONIC AORTIC REGURGITATION
The  onset  of  symptoms,  or  LV  systolic  dysfunction,  is  an  indica-
tion for surgery. Medical treatment with diuretics and vasodilators 
(angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor 
blockers  [ARBs],  dihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blockers,  or 
hydralazine)  may  be  useful  as  a  temporizing  measure.  Surgery 
can  then  be  performed  in  a  more  controlled  setting.  The  use  of 
vasodilators  to  extend  the  compensated  phase  of  chronic  severe 
AR  in  asymptomatic  patients  before  the  onset  of  symptoms  or 
the  development  of  LV  dysfunction  is  not  useful,  although  these 
agents  should  be  employed  to  treat  hypertension  (systolic  blood 
pressure  >140  mm  Hg).  It  is  often  difficult  to  achieve  adequate 
blood pressure control because of the increased stroke volume and 
enhanced LV ejection that accompany severe AR. Cardiac arrhyth-
mias and systemic infections are poorly tolerated in patients with 

severe AR and must be treated promptly and vigorously. Although 
nitroglycerin and long-acting nitrates are not as helpful in relieving 
anginal  pain  as  they  are  in  patients  with  coronary  heart  disease, 
they are worth a trial. Patients with syphilitic aortitis should receive 
a full course of penicillin therapy (Chap. 182). Beta blockers and 
the  ARB  losartan  may  be  useful  to  retard  the  rate  of  aortic  root 
enlargement in young patients with Marfan’s syndrome and aortic 
root  dilation.  A  randomized  controlled  trial  showed  no  differ-
ence in efficacy between atenolol and losartan for this indication. 
Whether  beta  blockers  or  ARBs  are  useful  in  retarding  the  rate 
of growth of aortic aneurysms in other patient subsets (e.g., BAV 
disease with aortopathy, Takayasu’s disease) has not been demon-
strated. Beta blockers in patients with valvular AR were previously 
considered  relatively  contraindicated  due  to  concern  that  slowing 
of the heart rate would allow more time for diastolic regurgitation. 
Observational reports, however, have suggested that beta blockers 
may provide functional benefit in some patients with chronic AR. 
Beta  blockers  can  sometimes  provide  incremental  blood  pressure 
lowering in patients with chronic AR and hypertension. They can 
also lessen the sense of forceful heart action that many patients find 
uncomfortable. Patients with severe AR, particularly those with an 
associated aortopathy, should avoid isometric exercises.

SURGICAL TREATMENT
In deciding on the advisability and proper timing of surgical treat-
ment, two points should be kept in mind: (1) patients with chronic 
severe AR usually do not become symptomatic until after the devel-
opment of myocardial dysfunction; and (2) when delayed too long 
(defined  as  >1  year  from  onset  of  symptoms  or  LV  dysfunction), 
surgical treatment often does not restore normal LV size and func-
tion. Therefore, in patients with chronic severe AR, careful clinical 
follow-up and noninvasive testing with echocardiography at ~6- to 
12-month intervals are necessary if operation is to be undertaken at 
the optimal time, i.e., after the onset of LV dysfunction but prior to 
the development of severe symptoms. Exercise testing may be helpful 
to assess effort tolerance more objectively. Operation can be deferred 
as long as the patient both remains asymptomatic and retains normal 
LV function without severe or progressive chamber dilation.

Aortic  valve  replacement  (AVR)  is  indicated  for  the  treatment 
of severe AR in symptomatic patients irrespective of LV function. 
In  general,  the  operation  should  be  carried  out  in  asymptomatic 
patients  with  severe  AR  and  progressive  LV  dysfunction  defined 
by an LVEF <55% on serial studies, an LV end-systolic dimension  
>50  mm  (>25  mm/m2),  or  an  LV  diastolic  dimension  >65  mm. 
Smaller  dimensions  may  be  appropriate  thresholds  in  individu-
als  of  smaller  stature  or  when  there  is  evidence  of  progressively 
decreasing LV function or increasing LV size on serial studies and 
the  anticipated  risks  for  surgical  morbidity  and  mortality  are  low. 
Two  case  series  from  surgical  referral  centers  have  suggested  that 

surgery should be performed at an even lower threshold for LV end-
systolic dimension index (≥20 mm/m2), but data from randomized 
controlled trials are lacking. Patients with severe AR without indi-
cations for operation should be followed by clinical and echocardio-
graphic examination every 6–12 months. Transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation (TAVI) is not recommended for patients with severe 
AR  who  are  surgical  candidates.  Technical  success  with  TAVI  in 
patients with chronic AR is limited by the degree of aortic annular 
dilation and the relative paucity of valvular and annular calcium.

Surgical  options  for  management  of  aortic  valve  and  root  dis-
ease have expanded considerably over the past decade. AVR with 
a  suitable  mechanical  or  tissue  (biological)  prosthesis  is  generally 
necessary in patients with rheumatic AR and in many patients with 
other causes of valvular AR. Rarely, when a leaflet has been perfo-
rated during IE or torn from its attachments to the aortic annulus 
by thoracic trauma, primary surgical repair may be possible. When 
AR is due to aneurysmal dilation of the root or proximal ascending 
aorta rather than to primary valve involvement, it may be possible 
to reduce or eliminate the regurgitation by narrowing the annulus 
or  by  excising  a  portion  of  the  aortic  root  without  replacing  the 
valve.  Elective,  valve-sparing  aortic  root  reconstruction  generally 
involves reimplantation of the valve in a contoured graft with reat-
tachment of the coronary artery buttons into the side of the graft 
and is best undertaken in specialized surgical centers (Fig. 262-2). 
Resuspension of the native aortic valve leaflets is possible in ~50% 
of patients with acute AR in the setting of type A aortic dissection.

In other conditions, however, AR can be effectively eliminated only 
by replacing the aortic valve, as well as the dilated or aneurysmal 
ascending aorta responsible for the regurgitation, and implanting a 
composite valve-graft conduit. This formidable procedure entails a 
higher risk than isolated AVR.

As  is  true  in  patients  with  other  valvular  heart  disease,  both 
operative and late mortality risks are largely dependent on the stage 
of the disease and myocardial function at the time of operation. The 
overall  operative  mortality  rate  for  isolated  AVR  (performed  for 
either or both AS or AR) is ~2% (Table 262-2). However, patients 
with  AR,  marked  cardiac  enlargement,  and  established  LV  dys-
function experience an operative mortality rate of ~10% and a late 
mortality rate of ~5% per year due to LV failure despite a technically 
satisfactory operation. Nonetheless, because of the very poor prog-
nosis with medical management, even patients with advanced LV 
systolic dysfunction should be considered for operation.

Patients with acute severe AR require prompt (24–48 h) surgical 

treatment, which may be lifesaving.

valvular heart disease is also considered in Chaps. 42 and 239; of elec-
trocardiography (ECG) in Chap. 240; of echocardiography and other

MITRAL STENOSIS
 ■ ETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY
Rheumatic  fever  is  the  leading  cause  of  mitral  stenosis  (MS)  
(Table  263-1;  see  also  Chap.  359).  Other  less  common  etiologies  of 
obstruction  to  left  ventricular  inflow  include  congenital  mitral  valve 
stenosis,  cor  triatriatum,  mitral  annular  calcification  with  extension 
onto the leaflets, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, 
left  atrial  myxoma,  and  infective  endocarditis  with  large  vegetations. 

Abbreviations: IE, infective endocarditis; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; SLE, systemic 
lupus erythematosus.

Pure  or  predominant  MS  occurs  in  ~40%  of  all  patients  with  rheu-
matic heart disease and a history of rheumatic fever (Chap. 359). In 
other patients with rheumatic heart disease, lesser degrees of MS may 
accompany  mitral  regurgitation  (MR)  and  aortic  valve  disease.  With 
reductions  in  the  incidence  of  acute  rheumatic  fever,  particularly  in 
temperate  climates  and  middle-  to  high-income  countries,  the  inci-
dence of MS has declined considerably over the past several decades. 
However,  it  remains  a  major  problem  in  low-income  countries, 
especially  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  India,  Southeast  Asia,  and  Oceania 
(Chap. 261).

In  rheumatic  MS,  chronic  inflammation  leads  to  diffuse  thicken-
ing  of  the  valve  leaflets  with  formation  of  fibrous  tissue  often  with 
calcific deposits. The mitral commissures fuse, the chordae tendineae 
fuse and shorten, the valvular cusps become rigid, and the pathologic 
process eventually leads to narrowing at the apex of the funnel-shaped 
(“fish-mouth”) valve. Although the initial insult to the mitral valve is 
rheumatic, later changes may be exacerbated by inflammation, fibro-
sis, and trauma to the valve due to altered flow patterns. Calcification 
of  the  stenotic  mitral  valve  immobilizes  the  leaflets  and  narrows  the 
orifice  further.  Thrombus  formation  and  arterial  embolization  may 
arise from the calcific valve itself, but in patients with atrial fibrillation 
(AF), thrombi arise more frequently from the dilated left atrium (LA), 
particularly from within the LA appendage.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
In  normal  adults,  the  area  of  the  mitral  valve  orifice  is  4–6  cm2.  In 
the  presence  of  significant  obstruction,  i.e.,  when  the  orifice  area  is 
reduced to <~2 cm2, blood can flow from the LA to the left ventricle 
(LV) only if propelled by an abnormally elevated left atrioventricular 
pressure gradient, the hemodynamic hallmark of MS. When the mitral 
valve  opening  is  reduced  to  <1.5  cm2,  referred  to  as  “severe”  MS,  an 
LA  pressure  of  ~25  mmHg  is  required  to  maintain  a  normal  cardiac 
output (CO). The elevated pulmonary venous and pulmonary arterial 
(PA) wedge pressures reduce pulmonary compliance, contributing to 
exertional dyspnea. The first bouts of dyspnea are usually precipitated 
by clinical events that increase the rate of blood flow across the mitral 
orifice, resulting in further elevation of the LA pressure (see below).

To  assess  the  severity  of  obstruction  hemodynamically,  both  the 
transvalvular  pressure  gradient  and  the  flow  rate  must  be  measured 
(Chap. 242). The latter depends not only on the CO but on the heart 
rate, as well. An increase in heart rate shortens diastole proportionately 
more than systole and diminishes the time available for flow across the 
mitral valve. Therefore, at any given level of CO, tachycardia, including 
that  associated  with  rapid  AF,  augments  the  transvalvular  pressure 
gradient and elevates further the LA pressure. Similar considerations 
apply to the pathophysiology of tricuspid stenosis (TS).

The LV diastolic pressure and ejection fraction (EF) are normal in 
isolated MS. In MS and sinus rhythm, the elevated LA and PA wedge 
pressures exhibit a prominent atrial contraction pattern (a wave) and 
a gradual pressure decline after the v wave and mitral valve opening  
(y descent). In severe MS and whenever pulmonary vascular resistance 
is significantly increased, the PA pressure (PAP) is elevated at rest and 
rises  further  during  exercise,  often  causing  secondary  elevations  of 
right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic pressure and volume.

Cardiac  Output 
In  patients  with  severe  MS  (mitral  valve  orifice 
1–1.5 cm2), the CO is normal or almost so at rest, but rises subnormally 

HPIM21e_Part6_p1797-p2130.indd   1991

1992 during exertion. In patients with very severe MS (valve area <1 cm2), 
particularly those in whom pulmonary vascular resistance is markedly 
elevated, the CO is subnormal at rest and may fail to rise or may even 
decline during activity.

Pulmonary  Hypertension  The  clinical  and  hemodynamic  fea-
tures  of  MS  are  influenced  importantly  by  the  level  of  the  PAP.  Pul-
monary hypertension results from (1) passive backward transmission 
of the elevated LA pressure; (2) pulmonary arteriolar constriction (the 
so-called “second stenosis”), which presumably is triggered by LA and 
pulmonary  venous  hypertension  (reactive  pulmonary  hypertension); 
(3) interstitial edema in the walls of the small pulmonary vessels; and 
(4) at end stage, organic obliterative changes in the pulmonary vascular 
bed. Severe pulmonary hypertension results in RV enlargement, sec-
ondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and pulmonic regurgitation (PR), 
as well as right-sided heart failure.
 ■ SYMPTOMS
In  temperate  climates,  the  latent  period  between  the  initial  attack  of 
rheumatic carditis (in the increasingly rare circumstances in which a 
history of one can be elicited) and the development of symptoms due to 
MS is generally about two decades; most patients begin to experience 
disability  in  the  fourth  decade  of  life.  Studies  carried  out  before  the 
development of surgical mitral valvotomy revealed that once a patient 
with MS became seriously symptomatic, the disease progressed inexo-
rably to death within 2–5 years.

In patients whose mitral orifices are large enough to accommodate 
a normal blood flow with only mild elevations of LA pressure, marked 
elevations of this pressure leading to dyspnea and cough may be pre-
cipitated  by  sudden  changes  in  the  heart  rate,  volume  status,  or  CO, 
as, for example, with severe exertion, excitement, fever, severe anemia, 
paroxysmal AF and other tachycardias, sexual intercourse, pregnancy, 
and  thyrotoxicosis.  As  MS  progresses,  lesser  degrees  of  stress  pre-
cipitate  dyspnea,  the  patient  becomes  limited  in  daily  activities,  and 
orthopnea  and  paroxysmal  nocturnal  dyspnea  develop.  The  devel-
opment of persistent AF often marks a turning point in the patient’s 
course and is generally associated with acceleration of the rate at which 
symptoms  progress.  Hemoptysis  (Chap.  39)  results  from  rupture  of 
pulmonary-bronchial  venous  connections  secondary  to  pulmonary 
venous hypertension. It occurs most frequently in patients who have 
elevated LA pressures without markedly elevated pulmonary vascular 
resistances and is rarely fatal. Recurrent pulmonary emboli (Chap. 279), 
sometimes  with  infarction,  are  an  important  cause  of  morbidity  and 
mortality late in the course of MS. Pulmonary infections, i.e., bronchi-
tis, bronchopneumonia, and lobar pneumonia, commonly complicate 
untreated MS, especially during the winter months.

Pulmonary Changes 
In addition to the aforementioned changes 
in the pulmonary vascular bed, fibrous thickening of the walls of the 
alveoli and pulmonary capillaries occurs commonly in MS. The vital 
capacity, total lung capacity, maximal breathing capacity, and oxygen 
uptake  per  unit  of  ventilation  are  reduced  (Chap.  285).  Pulmonary 
compliance falls further as pulmonary capillary pressure rises during 
exercise.

Thrombi  and  Emboli  Thrombi  may  form  in  the  left  atria,  par-
ticularly  within  the  enlarged  atrial  appendages  of  patients  with  MS. 
Systemic embolization, the incidence of which is 10–20%, occurs more 
frequently in patients with AF, in patients >65 years of age, and in those 
with a reduced CO. However, systemic embolization may be the pre-
senting feature in otherwise asymptomatic patients with only mild MS.
 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
(See also Chaps. 42 and 239)

Inspection and Palpation 
In patients with severe MS, there may 
be a malar flush with pinched and blue facies. In patients with sinus 
rhythm and severe pulmonary hypertension or associated TS, the jugu-
lar venous pulse reveals prominent a waves due to vigorous right atrial 
systole.  The  systemic  arterial  pressure  is  usually  normal  or  slightly 
low. A parasternal lift signifies an enlarged RV. A diastolic thrill may 

rarely be present at the cardiac apex, with the patient in the left lateral 
recumbent position.

Auscultation  The  first  heart  sound  (S1)  is  usually  accentuated 
in  the  early  stages  of  the  disease  and  slightly  delayed.  The  pulmonic 
component  of  the  second  heart  sound  (P2)  also  is  often  accentuated 
with elevated PAPs, and the two components of the second heart sound 
(S2) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most 
readily  audible  in  expiration  at,  or  just  medial  to,  the  cardiac  apex. 
This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 
0.05–0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with 
the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, 
diastolic  murmur,  heard  best  at  the  apex  with  the  patient  in  the  left 
lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 239-5); it is accentuated by mild 
exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation. 
In  general,  the  duration  of  this  murmur  correlates  with  the  severity 
of  the  stenosis  in  patients  with  preserved  CO.  In  patients  with  sinus 
rhythm, the murmur often reappears or becomes louder during atrial 
systole (presystolic accentuation). Soft, grade I or II/VI systolic mur-
murs  may  be  heard  at  or  medial  to  the  apex  and  may  signify  mixed 
mitral  valve  disease  with  regurgitation.  Hepatomegaly,  ankle  edema, 
ascites, and pleural effusion, particularly in the right pleural cavity, may 
occur in patients with MS and RV failure.

Associated Lesions  With severe pulmonary hypertension, a pan-
systolic murmur produced by functional TR may be audible along the 
left sternal border. This murmur is usually louder during inspiration 
and  diminishes  during  forced  expiration  (Carvallo’s  sign).  When  the 
CO  is  markedly  reduced  in  MS,  the  typical  auscultatory  findings, 
including the diastolic rumbling murmur, may not be detectable (silent 
MS), but they may reappear as compensation is restored. The Graham 
Steell  murmur  of  PR,  a  high-pitched,  diastolic,  decrescendo  blowing 
murmur along the left sternal border, results from dilation of the pul-
monary valve ring and occurs in patients with mitral valve disease and 
severe pulmonary hypertension. This murmur may be indistinguish-
able from the more common murmur produced by aortic regurgitation 
(AR),  although  it  may  increase  in  intensity  with  inspiration  and  is 
accompanied by a loud and often palpable P2.
 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
ECG 
In  MS  and  sinus  rhythm,  the  P  wave  usually  suggests  LA 
enlargement (see Fig. 240-8). It may become tall and peaked in lead 
II and upright in lead V1 when severe pulmonary hypertension or TS 
complicates MS and right atrial (RA) enlargement develops. The QRS 
complex is usually normal. However, with severe pulmonary hyperten-
sion, right axis deviation and RV hypertrophy are often present.

Echocardiogram  (See  also  Chap.  241)  Transthoracic  echoc-
ardiography  (TTE)  with  color  flow  and  spectral  Doppler  imaging 
provides critical information, including measurements of mitral inflow 
velocity  during  early  (E  wave)  and  late  (A  wave  in  patients  in  sinus 
rhythm) diastolic filling, estimates of the transvalvular peak and mean 
gradients and mitral orifice area, the presence and severity of any associ-
ated MR, the extent of leaflet calcification and restriction, the degree of 
distortion of the subvalvular apparatus, and the anatomic suitability for 
percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC; see below). In 
addition, TTE provides an assessment of LV and RV function, chamber 
sizes, an estimation of the PA systolic pressure based on the tricuspid 
regurgitant jet velocity, and an indication of the presence and severity 
of  any  associated  valvular  lesions,  such  as  aortic  stenosis  (AS)  and/
or  regurgitation.  Transesophageal  echocardiography  (TEE)  provides 
superior images and should be used when TTE is inadequate for guid-
ing management decisions. TEE is especially indicated to exclude the 
presence of LA thrombus prior to PMBC. The performance of TTE with 
exercise to evaluate the mean mitral diastolic gradient and PAPs can be 
very helpful in the evaluation of patients with MS when there is a dis-
crepancy between the clinical findings and the resting hemodynamics.

border of the cardiac silhouette, prominence of the main PAs, dilation

esophagus by an enlarged LA. Kerley B lines are fine, dense, opaque, 
horizontal  lines  that  are  most  prominent  in  the  lower  and  mid-lung 
fields that result from distention of interlobular septae and lymphatics 
with edema when the resting mean LA pressure exceeds ~20 mmHg.
 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Like MS, significant MR may also be associated with a prominent dia-
stolic murmur at the apex due to increased antegrade transmitral flow, 
but  in  patients  with  isolated  MR,  this  diastolic  murmur  commences 
slightly  later  than  in  patients  with  MS,  and  there  is  often  clear-cut 
evidence of LV enlargement. An OS and increased P2 are absent, and 
S1 is soft or absent. An apical pansystolic murmur of at least grade III/
VI  intensity  as  well  as  an  S3  suggests  significant  MR.  Similarly,  the 
apical  mid-diastolic  murmur  associated  with  severe  AR  (Austin  Flint 
murmur)  may  be  mistaken  for  MS  but  can  be  differentiated  from  it 
because  it  is  not  intensified  in  pre-systole  and  becomes  softer  with 
administration of amyl nitrite or other arterial vasodilators. TS, which 
occurs rarely in the absence of MS, may mask many of the clinical fea-
tures of MS or be clinically silent; when present, the diastolic murmur 
of TS increases with inspiration and the y descent in the jugular venous 
pulse is delayed.

Atrial  septal  defect  (Chap.  269)  may  be  mistaken  for  MS;  in  both 
conditions, there is often clinical, ECG, and chest x-ray evidence of RV 
enlargement and accentuation of pulmonary vascularity. However, the 
absence of LA enlargement and of Kerley B lines and the demonstra-
tion of fixed splitting of S2 with a grade II or III mid-systolic murmur 
at the mid to upper left sternal border all favor atrial septal defect over 

MS. Atrial septal defects with large left-to-right shunts may result in 
functional TS because of the enhanced diastolic flow.

Left atrial myxoma (Chap. 271) may obstruct LA emptying, causing 
dyspnea,  a  diastolic  murmur,  and  hemodynamic  changes  resembling 
those of MS. However, patients with an LA myxoma often have features 
suggestive  of  a  systemic  disease,  such  as  weight  loss,  fever,  anemia, 
systemic emboli, and elevated serum IgG and interleukin 6 (IL-6) con-
centrations. The auscultatory findings may change markedly with body 
position. The diagnosis can be established by the demonstration of a 
characteristic echo-producing mass in the LA with TTE.

 ■ CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
Left  and  right  heart  catheterization  can  be  useful  when  there  is  a 
discrepancy between the clinical and noninvasive findings, including 
those from TEE and exercise echocardiographic testing when appro-
priate.  Catheterization  can  also  be  helpful  in  assessing  associated 
lesions, such as AS and AR, and in patients with recurring or worsening 
symptoms later after mitral valve intervention. Computed tomographic 
coronary angiography is increasingly used to screen preoperatively for 
the presence of coronary artery disease in appropriate patients prior to 
heart valve surgery or transcatheter treatment.

important  for  at-risk  patients  with  rheumatic  MS.  Recommenda-
tions for infective endocarditis prophylaxis are similar to those for 
other  valve  lesions  and  are  restricted  to  patients  at  high  risk  for 
complications from infection, including patients with a history of 
endocarditis.  In  symptomatic  patients,  some  improvement  usu-
ally  occurs  with  restriction  of  sodium  intake  and  small  doses  of 
oral diuretics. Beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers (e.g., verapamil or diltiazem), and digitalis glycosides are 
useful in slowing the ventricular rate of patients with AF. Vitamin 
K antagonist therapy (such as warfarin) targeted to an international 
normalized ratio (INR) of 2–3 should be administered indefinitely 
to patients with MS who have AF, a history of thromboembolism, or 
demonstrated LA thrombus. The routine use of a vitamin K antag-
onist  in  patients  in  sinus  rhythm  with  LA  enlargement  (maximal 
dimension  >5.5  cm)  with  or  without  spontaneous  echo  contrast 
is more controversial. As of this writing, non–vitamin K oral anti-
coagulants (e.g., apixaban, rivaroxaban) have not been adequately 
studied  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  rheumatic  MS  and, 
thus, are not recommended.

If AF is of relatively recent onset in a patient whose MS is not 
severe  enough  to  warrant  PMBC  or  surgical  intervention,  rever-
sion  to  sinus  rhythm  pharmacologically  or  by  means  of  electri-
cal  countershock  is  indicated.  Usually,  cardioversion  should  be 
undertaken  after  the  patient  has  had  at  least  3  consecutive  weeks 
of anticoagulant treatment to a therapeutic INR. If cardioversion is 
indicated more urgently, then intravenous heparin should be pro-
vided and TEE performed to exclude the presence of LA thrombus 
before  the  procedure.  Conversion  to  sinus  rhythm  is  rarely  suc-
cessful or sustained in patients with severe MS, particularly those 
in whom the LA is significantly enlarged or in whom AF has been 
present for >1 year, conditions that favor the development of an LA 
myopathy. 

MITRAL COMMISSUROTOMY
Unless there is a contraindication, mitral commissurotomy is indi-
cated in symptomatic (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Func-
tional Class II–IV) patients with isolated severe MS, whose effective 
orifice  (valve  area)  is  <~1  cm2/m2  body  surface  area,  or  <1.5  cm2 
in  normal-sized  adults.  Mitral  commissurotomy  can  be  carried 
out either percutaneously or surgically. In PMBC (Figs. 263-2 and 
263-3),  a  catheter  is  directed  into  the  LA  after  transseptal  punc-
ture, and a single balloon is directed across the valve and inflated 
in the valvular orifice. Ideal patients have relatively pliable leaflets 
with little or no commissural calcium. In addition, the subvalvular 
structures  should  not  be  significantly  scarred  or  thickened,  and 
there should be no LA thrombus. Any associated MR should be of 
≤2+/4+ severity. The short- and long-term results of this procedure 
in appropriate patients are similar to those of surgical commissuro-
tomy, but with less morbidity and a lower periprocedural mortality 
rate.  Event-free  survival  in  younger  (<45  years)  patients  with 
pliable  valves  is  excellent,  with  rates  as  high  as  80–90%  over  3–7 
years. Therefore, PMBC is the procedure of choice for such patients 
when it can be performed by a skilled operator in a high-volume  
center.

TTE is helpful in identifying patients for the percutaneous pro-
cedure;  TEE  is  performed  routinely  to  exclude  LA  thrombus  and 
to assess the degree of MR at the time of the scheduled procedure. 
An “echo score” has been developed to help guide decision-making. 
The score accounts for the degree of leaflet thickening, calcification, 
and mobility, and for the extent of subvalvular thickening. A lower 
score predicts a higher likelihood of successful PMBC.

In  patients  in  whom  PMBC  is  not  possible  or  unsuccessful,  or 
in many patients with restenosis after previous surgery, an “open” 
surgical commissurotomy using cardiopulmonary bypass is neces-
sary. In addition to opening the valve commissures, it is important 
to loosen any subvalvular fusion of papillary muscles and chordae 
tendineae; to remove large deposits of calcium, thereby improving

and prolongs survival. However, there is no evidence that the proce-
dure improves the prognosis of patients with slight or no functional 
impairment. Therefore, unless recurrent systemic embolization or 
severe pulmonary hypertension has occurred (PA systolic pressures 
>50 mmHg at rest or >60 mmHg with exercise), commissurotomy 
is not recommended for patients who are asymptomatic and/or who 
have mild or moderate stenosis (mitral valve area >1.5 cm2). When 
there is little symptomatic improvement after commissurotomy, it 
is likely that the procedure was ineffective, that it induced MR, or 
that associated valvular or myocardial disease was present. About 
half  of  all  patients  undergoing  surgical  mitral  commissurotomy 
require reoperation by 10 years. In the pregnant patient with MS, 
commissurotomy  should  be  carried  out  if  pulmonary  congestion 
occurs despite intensive medical treatment. PMBC is the preferred 
strategy in this setting and is performed with TEE and no or mini-
mal x-ray exposure.

Mitral valve replacement (MVR) is necessary in patients with MS 
and significant associated MR, those in whom the valve has been 
severely  distorted  by  previous  transcatheter  or  operative  manipu-
lation, or those in whom the surgeon does not find it possible to 
improve valve function significantly with commissurotomy. MVR 
is now routinely performed with preservation of the chordal attach-
ments to optimize LV functional recovery. Perioperative mortality 
rates with MVR vary with age, LV function, the presence of CAD, 
and associated comorbidities. They average 5% overall but are lower 
in young patients and may be twice as high in patients >65 years 
of age with significant comorbidities (Table 263-2). Because there 
are also long-term complications of valve replacement, patients in 
whom  preoperative  evaluation  suggests  the  possibility  that  MVR 
may  be  required  should  be  operated  on  only  if  they  have  severe 
MS—i.e.,  an  orifice  area  ≤1.5  cm2—and  are  in  NYHA  Class  III, 
i.e.,  symptomatic  with  ordinary  activity  despite  optimal  medical 
therapy. The overall 10-year survival of surgical survivors is ~70%. 
Long-term prognosis is worse in patients >65 years of age and those 
with marked disability and marked depression of the CO preopera-
tively. Pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction are additional 
risk factors for poor outcome.

264 Mitral Regurgitation

Patrick T. O’Gara, Joseph Loscalzo

The role of the physical examination in the evaluation of patients with 
valvular heart disease is also considered in Chaps. 42 and 239; of elec-
trocardiography (ECG) in Chap. 240; of echocardiography and other 
noninvasive imaging techniques in Chap. 241; and of cardiac catheter-
ization and angiography in Chap. 242.
 ■ ETIOLOGY
Mitral regurgitation (MR) may result from an abnormality or disease 
process that affects any one or more of the five functional components 
of the mitral valve apparatus (leaflets, annulus, chordae tendineae, pap-
illary muscles, and subjacent myocardium) (Table 264-1). Acute MR 
can occur in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI) with pap-
illary muscle rupture (Chap. 275), following blunt chest wall trauma, 
or  during  the  course  of  infective  endocarditis  (IE)  owing  to  leaflet 
perforation  or  destruction.  With  acute  MI,  the  posteromedial  papil-
lary  muscle  is  involved  much  more  frequently  than  the  anterolateral 
papillary muscle because of its singular blood supply. Transient, acute 
MR can occur during periods of active ischemia and bouts of angina 
pectoris. Rupture of chordae tendineae can result in “acute-on-chronic 
MR” in patients with myxomatous degeneration of the valve apparatus.
Chronic MR can result from several disease processes (Table 264-1). 
Distinction should be drawn between primary (degenerative) MR, in 
which the leaflets and/or chordae tendineae are primarily responsible 
for abnormal valve function, and secondary (functional) MR, in which 
the leaflets and chordae tendineae are usually normal but the regurgi-
tation is caused by left ventricular (LV) remodeling, annular dilation, 
papillary muscle displacement, dyssynchrony, posterior leaflet tether-
ing, or their combination. Patient assessment, treatment approach, and 
long-term prognosis differ significantly between primary and second-
ary  MR.  Mitral  valve  prolapse  (MVP)  is  discussed  more  extensively

1996 in  Chap.  265.  The  rheumatic  process  produces  rigidity,  deformity, 
and  retraction  of  the  valve  cusps  and  commissural  fusion,  as  well  as 
shortening, contraction, and fusion of the chordae tendineae. MR can 
persist after resolution of the acute phase of infection and inflamma-
tion. MR may occur as a congenital anomaly (Chap. 269), most com-
monly as a defect of the endocardial cushions (atrioventricular cushion 
defects).  A  cleft  anterior  mitral  valve  leaflet  accompanies  ostium 
primum atrial septal defect. Radiation can result in leaflet thickening, 
retraction,  and  calcification,  often  in  association  with  annular  and 
chordal involvement and some degree of mitral stenosis. Chronic MR 
occurs frequently after prior MI(s) associated with changes in LV size, 
shape, and function. Similar mechanisms of annular dilation and ven-
tricular remodeling contribute to the MR that occurs among patients 
with nonischemic forms of dilated cardiomyopathy once the LV end- 
diastolic  dimension  reaches  6  cm.  The  MR  associated  with  hyper-
trophic  obstructive  cardiomyopathy  (HOCM)  is  usually  dynamic  in 
nature and dependent on systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral 
valve  leaflet  into  a  narrowed  LV  outflow  tract.  Patients  with  chronic 
persistent  atrial  fibrillation  (AF)  may  develop  atrial  remodeling  and 
annular  dilation  with  inadequate  leaflet  lengthening  and  MR  (atrial 
functional  MR).  Secondary  MR  due  to  LV  remodeling  is  more  fre-
quently encountered in the community than secondary MR that occurs 
in association with AF and annular dilation. Annular calcification can 
result in MR when it encroaches on the leaflets or results in decreased 
sphincteric  function  and  is  especially  prevalent  among  patients  with 
advanced renal disease and is commonly observed in women >65 years 
of age with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Irrespective of cause, 
chronic severe MR is often progressive because enlargement of the left 
atrium (LA) places tension on the posterior mitral leaflet, pulling it fur-
ther away from the mitral orifice and thereby aggravating the valvular 
dysfunction. Similarly, LV dilation increases the regurgitation, which, 
in turn, enlarges the LA and LV further, resulting in a vicious circle; 
hence the aphorism, “MR begets MR.”

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The  resistance  to  LV  emptying  (LV  afterload)  is  reduced  in  patients 
with MR. As a consequence, the LV is decompressed into the LA dur-
ing  ejection,  and  with  the  reduction  in  LV  size  during  systole,  there 
is  a  rapid  decline  in  LV  tension.  The  initial  compensation  to  MR  is 
more complete LV emptying. However, LV volume increases progres-
sively  with  time  as  the  severity  of  the  regurgitation  increases  and  as 
LV  contractile  function  deteriorates.  This  increase  in  LV  volume  is 
often  accompanied  by  a  reduced  forward  cardiac  output  (CO).  LV 
compliance is often increased, and thus, LV diastolic pressure does not 
increase until late in the course. The regurgitant volume varies directly 
with  the  LV  systolic  pressure  and  the  size  of  the  regurgitant  orifice; 
the latter, in turn, is influenced by the extent of LV and mitral annular 
dilation. Because ejection fraction (EF) rises in severe MR in the pres-
ence of normal LV function, even a modest reduction in this parameter 
(<60%) reflects significant contractile dysfunction.

During early diastole, as the distended LA empties, there is a par-
ticularly rapid y descent in the absence of accompanying MS. A brief, 
early diastolic LA-LV pressure gradient (often generating a rapid filling 
sound [S3] and mid-diastolic murmur masquerading as MS) may occur 
in patients with pure, severe MR as a result of the very rapid flow of 
blood across a normal-sized mitral orifice.

Measurements  of  LV  ejection  fraction  (LVEF),  CO,  pulmonary 
arterial (PA) systolic pressure, regurgitant volume, regurgitant fraction 
(RF), and the effective regurgitant orifice area can be obtained during 
a  careful  Doppler  echocardiographic  examination.  These  measure-
ments can also be obtained accurately with cardiac magnetic resonance 
(CMR) imaging, although this technology is not widely available. Left 
and right heart catheterization with contrast ventriculography is used 
less frequently. Chronic, severe MR is defined by a regurgitant volume 
≥60 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction (RF) ≥50%, and effective regurgitant 
orifice area ≥0.40 cm2. In patients with secondary MR, in whom the 
severity  of  MR  can  be  underappreciated  using  echocardiographic/
Doppler techniques, lesser degrees of regurgitation may carry relatively 
greater  prognostic  weight.  The  adverse  prognosis  in  secondary  MR 

related to adverse LV remodeling is intimately related to the degree of 
myocardial dysfunction.

LA  Compliance 
In  acute  severe  MR,  the  regurgitant  volume  is 
delivered  into  a  normal-sized  LA  having  normal  or  reduced  compli-
ance.  As  a  result,  LA  pressures  rise  markedly  for  any  increase  in  LA 
volume.  The  v  wave  in  the  LA  pressure  pulse  is  usually  prominent, 
LA and pulmonary venous pressures are markedly elevated, and pul-
monary edema is common. Because of the rapid rise in LA pressures 
during ventricular systole, the murmur of acute MR is early in timing 
and decrescendo in configuration ending well before S2, as a reflection 
of the progressive diminution in the LV-LA pressure gradient. LV sys-
tolic function in acute MR may be normal, hyperdynamic, or reduced, 
depending on the clinical context.

Patients with chronic severe MR, on the other hand, develop marked 
LA enlargement and increased LA compliance with little if any increase 
in LA and pulmonary venous pressures for any increase in LA volume. 
The LA v wave is relatively less prominent. The murmur of chronic MR 
is classically holosystolic in timing and plateau in configuration, as a 
reflection of the near-constant LV-LA pressure gradient. These patients 
usually complain of severe fatigue and exhaustion secondary to a low 
forward CO, whereas symptoms resulting from pulmonary congestion 
are less prominent initially; AF is almost invariably present once the 
LA dilates significantly.

 ■ SYMPTOMS
Patients  with  chronic  mild-to-moderate,  isolated  MR  are  usually 
asymptomatic.  This  form  of  LV  volume  overload  is  well  tolerated. 
Fatigue,  exertional  dyspnea,  and  orthopnea  are  the  most  prominent 
complaints in patients with chronic severe MR. Palpitations are com-
mon  and  may  signify  the  onset  of  AF.  Late-onset  right-sided  heart 
failure, with painful hepatic congestion, ankle edema, distended neck 
veins,  ascites,  and  secondary  tricuspid  regurgitation  (TR),  occurs  in 
patients  with  MR  who  have  associated  pulmonary  vascular  disease 
and pulmonary hypertension. Acute pulmonary edema is common in 
patients with acute severe MR.

 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
In patients with chronic severe MR, the arterial pressure is usually nor-
mal, although the carotid arterial pulse may show a sharp, low-volume 
upstroke  owing  to  the  reduced  forward  CO.  A  systolic  thrill  is  often 
palpable at the cardiac apex, the LV is hyperdynamic with a brisk sys-
tolic impulse and a palpable rapid-filling wave (S3), and the apex beat 
is often displaced laterally.

In patients with acute severe MR, the arterial pressure may be reduced 
with  a  narrow  pulse  pressure,  the  jugular  venous  pressure  and  wave-
forms may be normal or increased and exaggerated, the apical impulse is 
not displaced, and signs of pulmonary congestion are prominent.

Auscultation  S1 is generally absent, soft, or buried in the holosys-
tolic murmur of chronic, severe MR. In patients with severe MR, the 
aortic valve may close prematurely (due to the reduced forward cardiac 
output), resulting in wide but physiologic splitting of S2. A low-pitched 
S3 occurring 0.12–0.17 s after the aortic valve closure sound, i.e., at the 
completion of the rapid-filling phase of the LV, is believed to be caused 
by the sudden tensing of the papillary muscles, chordae tendineae, and 
valve  leaflets.  It  may  be  followed  by  a  short,  rumbling,  mid-diastolic 
murmur, even in the absence of structural MS. In patients with ische-
mic or dilated cardiomyopathy, however, a third sound (S3) may also 
signify ventricular dysfunction. A fourth heart sound is often audible 
in patients with acute severe MR who are in sinus rhythm. A presystolic 
murmur is not ordinarily heard with isolated MR.

A  systolic  murmur  of  at  least  grade  III/VI  intensity  is  the  most 
characteristic  auscultatory  finding  in  chronic  severe  MR.  It  is  usually 
holosystolic (see Fig. 239-5A), but as previously noted, it is decrescendo 
and ceases in mid-to-late systole in patients with acute severe MR. The 
systolic murmur of chronic MR is usually most prominent at the apex 
and radiates to the axilla. However, in patients with ruptured chordae 
tendineae  or  primary  involvement  of  the  posterior  mitral  leaflet  with 
prolapse or flail, the regurgitant jet is eccentric, directed anteriorly, and

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemstrikes the LA wall adjacent to the aortic root. In this situation, the sys-
tolic murmur is transmitted to the base of the heart and, therefore, may 
be confused with the murmur of AS. In patients with ruptured chordae 
tendineae, the systolic murmur may have a cooing or “seagull” quality, 
whereas  a  flail  leaflet  may  produce  a  murmur  with  a  musical  quality. 
The systolic murmur of chronic MR not due to MVP is intensified by 
isometric exercise (handgrip) but is reduced during the strain phase of 
the Valsalva maneuver because of the associated decrease in LV preload.

 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
ECG 
In patients with sinus rhythm, there is evidence of LA enlarge-
ment, but right atrial (RA) enlargement also may be present when pul-
monary hypertension is significant and affects RV function and size. 
Chronic severe MR is frequently associated with AF. In many patients, 
there is no clear-cut ECG evidence of enlargement of either ventricle. 
In others, the signs of eccentric LV hypertrophy are present.

Echocardiogram  Transthoracic  echocardiography  (TTE)  is  indi-
cated to assess the mechanism of the MR and its hemodynamic sever-
ity. LV function can be assessed from LV end-diastolic and end-systolic 
volumes and EF. Observations can be made regarding leaflet structure 
and function, chordal integrity, LA and LV size, annular calcification, 
and regional and global LV systolic function. Doppler imaging should 
demonstrate the width or area of the color flow MR jet within the LA, 
the duration and intensity of the continuous wave Doppler signal, the 
pulmonary venous flow contour, the early peak mitral inflow velocity, 
and  quantitative  measures  of  regurgitant  volume,  RF,  and  effective 
regurgitant  orifice  area.  In  addition,  the  PA  pressures  (PAPs)  can  be 
estimated from the TR jet velocity. TTE is also indicated to follow the 

course of patients with chronic MR and to provide rapid assessment for 
any clinical change. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provides 
greater anatomic detail than TTE (see Fig. 241-5). Exercise testing with 
TTE can be useful to assess exercise capacity as well as any dynamic 
change in MR severity, PA systolic pressures, and biventricular func-
tion,  for  patients  in  whom  there  is  a  discrepancy  between  clinical 
findings and the results of other noninvasive testing.

Chest  X-Ray  The  LA  and  LV  are  the  dominant  chambers  in 
chronic  MR.  Late  in  the  course  of  the  disease,  the  LA  may  be  mas-
sively  enlarged  and  forms  the  right  border  of  the  cardiac  silhouette. 
Pulmonary  venous  congestion,  interstitial  edema,  and  Kerley  B  lines 
are sometimes noted. Marked calcification of the mitral leaflets occurs 
commonly  in  patients  with  long-standing,  combined  rheumatic  MR 
and MS, as well as in patients with radiation-induced mitral valve dis-
ease. Calcification of the mitral annulus may be visualized, particularly 
on  the  lateral  view  of  the  chest.  Patients  with  acute  severe  MR  may 
have  asymmetric  pulmonary  edema  if  the  regurgitant  jet  is  directed 
predominantly to the orifice of an upper lobe pulmonary vein.

MEDICAL TREATMENT
The management of chronic severe MR depends to some degree on 
its cause. Anticoagulation with either warfarin or a direct oral agent 
(e.g., apixaban, rivaroxaban) should be provided if AF intervenes, 
as guided by the CHA2DS2-VASc risk score. The direct oral antico-
agulants should not be used if moderate or severe rheumatic mitral

stenosis is also present; they are also not approved for use in patients 
with  mechanical  prosthetic  heart  valves.  Cardioversion  should  be 
considered  depending  on  the  clinical  context,  AF  chronicity,  and 
LA  size.  In  contrast  to  the  acute  setting,  there  are  no  large,  long-
term  prospective  studies  to  substantiate  the  use  of  vasodilators 
for  the  treatment  of  chronic,  isolated  severe  MR  with  preserved 
LV  systolic  function  in  the  absence  of  systemic  hypertension.  The 
severity of secondary MR in the setting of an ischemic or dilated 
cardiomyopathy  may  diminish  with  aggressive  guideline-directed 
therapy (GDMT) of heart failure including the use of diuretics for 
decongestion, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors/angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  angiotensin-neprilysin 
inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 inhibitors and biventricular pacing (cardiac resyn-
chronization  therapy  [CRT])  when  indicated.  Antibiotic  prophy-
laxis for prevention of IE is indicated for MR patients with a prior 
history  of  IE.  Asymptomatic  patients  with  severe  MR  in  sinus 
rhythm  with  normal  LV  size  and  systolic  function  should  avoid 
isometric forms of exercise.

Patients  with  acute  severe  MR  require  urgent  stabilization  and 
preparation for surgery. Diuretics, intravenous vasodilators (partic-
ularly sodium nitroprusside), and even mechanical support may be 
needed for patients with post-MI papillary muscle rupture or other 
forms of acute severe MR. 
SURGICAL TREATMENT
In  the  selection  of  patients  with  chronic,  severe,  primary  MR 
for  surgical  treatment,  the  often  slowly  progressive  nature  of  the 
condition must be balanced against the immediate and long-term 
risks associated with operation. These risks are significantly lower 
for primary valve repair than for valve replacement (Table 264-2). 
Repair  usually  consists  of  valve  reconstruction  using  a  variety  of 

valvuloplasty  techniques  and  insertion  of  an  annuloplasty  ring. 
Repair  spares  the  patient  the  long-term  adverse  consequences  of 
valve  replacement,  including  thromboembolic  and  hemorrhagic 
complications in the case of mechanical prostheses and late valve 
failure  necessitating  repeat  valve  replacement  in  the  case  of  bio-
prostheses.  In  addition,  by  preserving  the  integrity  of  the  papil-
lary muscles, subvalvular apparatus, and chordae tendineae, mitral 
repair and valvuloplasty maintain LV function to a relatively greater 
degree than does valve replacement.

Surgery for chronic severe primary MR is indicated once symp-
toms occur, especially if valve repair is feasible (Fig. 264-1). Surgery 
should  also  be  recommended  for  asymptomatic  patients  with  LV 
dysfunction  characterized  by  an  EF  ≤60%  or  an  LV  end-systolic 
dimension (LV ESD) ≥40 mm. Other indications for early consider-
ation of mitral valve repair in asymptomatic patients include a pro-
gressive decrease in LVEF or increase in LV ESD on serial imaging

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemas well as MV anatomy that would predict a >95% of a successful 
and durable repair in a low surgical risk patient. These aggressive 
recommendations for surgery are predicated on the adverse long-
term consequences of waiting for LV function to decline further as 
well as the outstanding results achievable with mitral valve repair by 
reference surgeons at high-volume centers. Indeed, repair of myx-
omatous MR (e.g., prolapse, flail) in patients <75 years with normal 
LV  systolic  function  and  no  coronary  artery  disease  (CAD)  can 
now be performed by experienced surgeons with <1% perioperative 
mortality risk. The risk of stroke, however, is also ~1%. Repair is fea-
sible in up to 95% of patients with myxomatous disease operated on 
by a high-volume surgeon in a referral center of excellence. Repair 
techniques include chordal transfer, creation of neochords, limited 
leaflet resection, and insertion of an annuloplasty band. Long-term 
durability is excellent; the incidence of reoperative surgery for failed 
primary repair is ~1% per year for the first 10 years after surgery. 
For patients with AF, left or biatrial maze surgery, or radiofrequency 
isolation of the pulmonary veins, along with left atrial appendage 
amputation, is performed to reduce the risk of recurrent postopera-
tive AF and associated thrombus formation.

The surgical management of patients with secondary MR is more 
complicated.  Surgery  for  patients  with  ischemic  MR  most  often 
involves  simultaneous  coronary  artery  revascularization.  Current 
surgical practice includes either annuloplasty repair with an under-
sized,  rigid  ring  or  chord-sparing  valve  replacement  for  patients 
with moderate or greater degrees of MR. Valve repair for ischemic 
MR  is  associated  with  lower  perioperative  mortality  rates  than 
valve  replacement  but  significantly  higher  rates  of  recurrent  MR 
over time. Thus, replacement may be preferred over repair in this 
context. In patients with ischemic MR and significantly impaired LV 
systolic function (EF <30%), the risk of surgery is higher, recovery 
of LV performance is incomplete, and long-term survival is reduced. 
Referral  for  surgery  must  be  individualized  and  made  only  after 
aggressive  attempts  to  improve  symptoms  with  GDMT  and  CRT, 
when indicated. The routine performance of surgical valve repair in 
patients with significant secondary MR due to a dilated cardiomyo-
pathy has not been shown to improve long-term survival compared 
with  optimal  GDMT.  Patients  with  acute  severe  MR  can  often  be 
stabilized temporarily with appropriate medical therapy, but surgi-
cal correction will be necessary emergently in the case of papillary 
muscle rupture and within days to weeks in most other settings.

When  surgical  treatment  is  contemplated,  left  and  right  heart 
catheterization  and  left  ventriculography  may  be  helpful  in  con-
firming  the  presence  of  severe  MR  in  patients  in  whom  there  is 
a  discrepancy  between  the  clinical  and  TTE  findings  that  cannot 
be  resolved  with  TEE  or  CMR.  Coronary  angiography  identifies 
patients who require concomitant coronary revascularization. 

TRANSCATHETER MITRAL VALVE REPAIR AND 
REPLACEMENT
A transcatheter approach to the treatment of either primary or sec-
ondary  MR  may  be  feasible  in  selected  patients  with  appropriate 
mitral  valve  anatomy.  One  approach  involves  the  deployment  of  a 
clip  delivered  via  transseptal  puncture  that  grasps  the  leading  edges 
of the mitral leaflets in their mid-portion (anterior scallop to poste-
rior scallop or A2-P2;  Fig. 264-3). The length and width of the gap 
between these leading edges, as well as other considerations such as 
leaflet thickening and calcification, dictate patient eligibility. The clip 
device for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is commercially 
available for treatment of both primary and secondary MR in appro-
priately selected patients (Figs. 264-1 and 264-2). The results of tran-
sthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic imaging are critical 
to patient selection, along with a detailed assessment of surgical risk, 
comorbidities, and the adequacy of GDMT for heart failure. The use 
of TEER with a clip device in addition to medical therapy was shown 
to be superior to medical therapy alone in a trial involving symptom-
atic  heart  failure  patients  with  reduced  EF  and  at  least  moderately 
severe secondary MR. Patients treated with the clip device had fewer 
heart  failure  hospitalizations  and  longer  survival  than  those  treated

medically. This was the first trial to show such benefit in patients with 
secondary MR and has impacted clinical practice. Other transcatheter 
approaches to mitral valve repair include the deployment of a device 
within the coronary sinus that can be adjusted to reduce mitral annu-
lar circumference and the effective orifice area of the valve much like 
a  surgically  implanted  ring.  Variations  in  the  anatomic  relationship 
of the coronary sinus to the mitral annulus and circumflex coronary 
artery  have  limited  the  applicability  of  this  technique.  Attempts  to 
reduce the septal-lateral dimension of a dilated annulus using adjust-
able  cords  placed  across  the  LV  in  a  subvalvular  location  have  also 
been  investigated.  Construction  of  neochords  to  the  mitral  leaflets 
under TEE guidance using a system delivered via the cardiac apex is 
also under study. Investigational experience to date with transcatheter 
mitral valve replacement systems is in early clinical stages, although 
the field is evolving rapidly.

2000 MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP), also variously termed the systolic click-
murmur  syndrome,  Barlow’s  syndrome  (Fig.  265-1),  floppy-valve  syn-
drome,  and  billowing  mitral  leaflet  syndrome,  is  a  relatively  common 
but  highly  variable  clinical  syndrome  resulting  from  diverse  patho-
logic  mechanisms  affecting  the  mitral  valve  apparatus.  Among  these 
are  excessive  or  redundant  mitral  leaflet  tissue,  which  is  commonly 
associated  with  myxomatous  degeneration  and  greatly  increased 
concentrations of certain glycosaminoglycans. MVP is the most com-
mon  abnormality  leading  to  primary  mitral  regurgitation  (MR)  (see 
Chap. 264).

In most patients with MVP, the cause is unknown, but in some, it 
appears  to  be  genetically  determined.  A  reduction  in  the  production 
of type III collagen has been implicated, and electron microscopy has 
revealed fragmentation of collagen fibrils.

MVP  is  a  frequent  finding  in  patients  with  heritable  disorders  of 
connective tissue, including Marfan syndrome (Chap. 413), osteogen-
esis imperfecta, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. MVP may be associated 
with thoracic skeletal deformities similar to but not as severe as those 
in  Marfan  syndrome,  such  as  a  high-arched  palate  and  alterations 
of  the  chest  and  thoracic  spine,  including  the  so-called  straight  back 
syndrome. Other associated features can include a history of inguinal 
hernias, joint dislocations, meniscal tears, and easy bruisability.

In most patients with MVP, myxomatous degeneration is confined 
to the mitral valve, although the tricuspid and aortic valves may also 
be affected. The posterior mitral leaflet is usually more affected than 
the  anterior,  and  the  mitral  valve  annulus  is  often  dilated.  In  many 
patients, elongated, redundant, or ruptured chordae tendineae cause or 
contribute to the regurgitation.

FIGURE  265-1  Congenital  or  developmental  mitral  valve  prolapse.  Myxomatous 
thickening and prolapse of the mitral valve can occur in isolation in 2–3% of the 
general population or may be associated with heritable collagen-vascular disorders 
and aortic root dilation, such as in Marfan syndrome. Myxomatous degeneration 
of  the  valve  predisposes  to  severe  regurgitation  and  chordal  rupture  and  is  a 
frequent  indication  for  mitral  valve  repair  or  replacement.  Prolapse  can  affect 
one  or  both  leaflets,  to  varying  degrees.  A.  Three-dimensional  transesophageal

leaflet hooding (arrows). The chordae are focally thickened but are not fused as

MVP also may occur rarely as a sequel to acute rheumatic fever, in 
ischemic heart disease, and in various cardiomyopathies, as well as in 
20% of patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect.

MVP may lead to excessive stress on the papillary muscles, which, 
in  turn,  leads  to  dysfunction  and  ischemia  of  the  papillary  muscles 
and the subjacent ventricular myocardium. Rupture of chordae tend-
ineae and progressive annular dilation and calcification contribute to 
valvular regurgitation, which then places more stress on the diseased 
mitral valve apparatus, thereby creating a vicious cycle. ECG changes 
(see  below)  and  ventricular  arrhythmias  described  in  some  patients 
with MVP appear to result from regional ventricular dysfunction and 
fibrosis related to the increased stress placed on the papillary muscles.
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
MVP is more common in women than men and occurs most frequently 
between the ages of 15 and 30 years; the clinical course is most often 
benign. MVP may also be observed in older (>50 years) patients, often 
men, in whom MR is often more severe because of chordal rupture and 
requires surgical treatment. There is an increased familial incidence for 
some patients, suggesting an autosomal dominant form of inheritance 
with incomplete penetrance. MVP varies in its clinical expression, rang-
ing  from  only  a  systolic  click  and  murmur  with  mild  prolapse  of  the 
posterior leaflet to severe MR due to chordal rupture and leaflet flail. 
The degree of myxomatous change of the leaflets can also vary widely. 
In  many  patients,  the  condition  progresses  over  years  or  decades;  in 
others, it worsens rapidly as a result of chordal rupture or endocarditis.
Most patients are asymptomatic and remain so for their entire lives. 
However,  in  North  America,  MVP  is  now  the  most  common  cause 
of  isolated  severe  MR  requiring  surgical  treatment.  Arrhythmias, 
most  commonly  ventricular  premature  contractions  and  paroxysmal 
supraventricular  and  ventricular  tachycardia,  as  well  as  atrial  fibril-
lation  (AF),  have  been  reported  and  may  cause  palpitations,  light- 
headedness,  and  syncope.  Sudden  death  is  a  very  rare  complication 
and occurs most often in patients with severe MR and depressed left 
ventricle  (LV)  systolic  function,  although  it  can  occur  in  individuals 
with  normal  LV  size  and  function.  A  small  subset  of  MVP  patients 
with  high-grade  ventricular  ectopy  has  been  identified  with  pheno-
typic  features  including  electrocardiographic  inferior-apical  T-wave 
abnormalities,  high-density  premature  ventricular  complexes  at  rest, 
mitral annular disjunction (defined as abnormal atrial displacement of 
the mitral valve leaflet hinge point), and papillary muscle fibrosis on 
cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  with  late  gadolinium  enhance-
ment. In addition, there may be an excess risk of sudden death among 
patients with a flail leaflet. Many patients have chest pain that is dif-
ficult to evaluate; it is often substernal, prolonged, and not related to 
exertion, but may rarely resemble angina pectoris. Transient cerebral 
ischemic  attacks  secondary  to  emboli  from  the  mitral  valve  due  to 
endothelial disruption have been reported. Infective endocarditis may 
occur in patients with MR and/or leaflet thickening.
Auscultation  A frequent finding is the mid- or late (nonejection) 
systolic click, which occurs 0.14 s or more after S1 and is thought to 
be generated by the sudden tensing of slack, elongated chordae tend-
ineae  or  by  the  prolapsing  mitral  leaflet  when  it  reaches  its  maximal 
excursion.  Systolic  clicks  may  be  multiple  and  may  be  followed  by 
a  high-pitched,  mid-late  systolic  crescendo–decrescendo  murmur, 
which  occasionally  is  “whooping”  or  “honking”  and  is  heard  best  at 
the apex. Radiation of the murmur will depend on the involved leaflet. 
With posterior leaflet prolapse, the jet of MR is directed anteriorly and 
the murmur will radiate to the base of the heart. With anterior leaflet 
involvement, the jet of MR is directed posteriorly and the murmur will 
radiate to the axilla and back. The click and murmur occur earlier with 
standing, during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver and with 
any  intervention  that  decreases  LV  volume  (preload),  exaggerating 
the  propensity  of  the  leaflet  to  prolapse.  Conversely,  squatting  and 
isometric  exercises,  which  increase  LV  volume,  diminish  MVP;  the 
click-murmur complex is delayed, moves away from S1, and may even 
disappear. Some patients have a mid-systolic click without a murmur; 
others have a murmur without a click. Still others have both sounds at 
different times.

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular SystemLABORATORY EXAMINATION
The ECG most commonly is normal but may show biphasic or inverted 
T waves in leads II, III, and aVF and, occasionally, supraventricular or 
ventricular premature beats. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is 
particularly effective in identifying the abnormal position and prolapse 
of  the  mitral  valve  leaflets.  A  useful  echocardiographic  definition  of 
MVP is systolic displacement (in the parasternal long axis view) of the 
belly of the mitral valve leaflets by at least 2 mm into the left atrium 
(LA) superior to the plane of the mitral annulus. There can be prolapse 
of one or both leaflets (Fig. 265-2). Color flow and continuous wave 
Doppler imaging is helpful to evaluate the associated MR and provide 
estimates of severity. The jet lesion of MR due to MVP is most often 
eccentric, and assessment of the effective regurgitant orifice area and 
regurgitant  volume  can  be  difficult  with  standard  techniques.  Both 
three-dimensional echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance 
imaging  can  provide  more  precise  determinations  of  LV  volumes. 
Transesophageal  echocardiography  (TEE)  is  indicated  when  more 
accurate anatomic information is required and is performed routinely 
for intraoperative guidance during valve repair. Exercise testing can be 
performed when there is uncertainty regarding functional capacity. It 
is often combined with rest and immediate poststress TTE to assess LV 
and right ventricular (RV) function and the dynamic nature of MR and 
pulmonary artery pressures. Left ventriculography done at the time of 
right and left heart catheterization is rarely necessary but can also show 
prolapse of the posterior and sometimes of both mitral valve leaflets.

TREATMENT
Mitral Valve Prolapse

Infective  endocarditis  prophylaxis  is  indicated  for  patients  with  a 
prior history of endocarditis. Beta blockers sometimes relieve chest 
pain and control palpitations. Decisions regarding anticoagulation 
for  stroke  prevention  in  AF  should  be  based  on  the  CHA2DS2-
VASc  score  and  an  assessment  of  bleeding  risk.  If  the  patient  is 
symptomatic from severe MR, mitral valve repair is indicated (see 
Fig. 264-1). Other indications for surgery for MVP with severe pri-
mary MR include findings of established or progressive LV systolic 
dysfunction.  Surgery  can  also  be  considered  for  low-risk  asymp-
tomatic  patients  in  whom  a  successful  and  durable  repair  can  be 
achieved with at least 95% likelihood by an expert surgeon. Mitral 
valve repair is preferred over replacement in patients with MVP or 
flail mitral leaflet (see Table 264-2); technical success is dependent 
not only on the anatomic findings but also on the skill and expe-
rience of the surgeon. Repair of isolated posterior leaflet prolapse 
is  usually  straightforward,  but  increasingly  more  complex  pathol-
ogies  (e.g.,  anterior  leaflet  prolapse,  bileaflet  prolapse,  Barlow’s 
deformity) require advanced skills. Careful pre- and intraoperative 
TEE imaging is an important component of patient evaluation and 
surgical planning. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) using 
a  clip  to  grasp  the  anterior  and  posterior  leaflets  together  can  be

considered  for  treatment  of  symptomatic  patients  at  prohibitive 
or  high  surgical  risk  with  severe  primary  MR  due  to  MVP  (see   
Fig. 264-3). Most often, the MR will be reduced in severity but not 
eliminated. Nevertheless, symptom status and indices of LV size and 
function can be improved with this approach, which is now offered 
at  >475  specialized  sites  in  the  United  States.  Reported  hospital 
mortality rates following the procedure are ~2%. Other transcathe-
ter repair and replacement devices are not yet approved for clinical 
use in the United States (see Chap. 264).

266 Tricuspid Valve Disease

Patrick T. O’Gara, Joseph Loscalzo

TRICUSPID STENOSIS
Tricuspid stenosis (TS), which is much less prevalent than mitral steno-
sis (MS) in North America and Western Europe, is generally rheumatic 
in origin and is more common in women than men (Table 266-1). It 
does not occur as an isolated lesion and is usually associated with MS. 
Hemodynamically  significant  TS  occurs  in  5–10%  of  patients  with 
severe  MS;  rheumatic  TS  is  commonly  associated  with  some  degree 
of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Nonrheumatic causes of TS are rare.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
A diastolic pressure gradient between the right atrium (RA) and right 
ventricle  (RV)  defines  TS.  It  is  augmented  when  the  transvalvular 
blood flow increases during inspiration and declines during expiration. 
A mean diastolic pressure gradient of 4 mmHg is usually sufficient to 
elevate the mean RA pressure to levels that result in systemic venous 
congestion.  Unless  sodium  intake  has  been  restricted  and  diuretics 
administered, this venous congestion is associated with hepatomegaly, 
ascites, and edema, sometimes severe. In patients with sinus rhythm, 
the RA a wave may be extremely tall and may even approach the level 
of  the  RV  systolic  pressure.  The  y  descent  is  prolonged.  The  cardiac 
output  (CO)  at  rest  is  usually  depressed,  and  it  fails  to  rise  during 
exercise. The low CO is responsible for the normal or only slightly ele-
vated left atrial (LA), pulmonary artery (PA), and RV systolic pressures 
despite  the  presence  of  MS.  Thus,  the  presence  of  TS  can  mask  the 
hemodynamic and clinical features of any associated MS.
 ■ SYMPTOMS
Because the development of MS generally precedes that of TS, many 
patients initially have symptoms of pulmonary congestion and fatigue. 
Characteristically, patients with severe TS complain of relatively little 
dyspnea for the degree of hepatomegaly, ascites, and edema that they 
have. However, fatigue secondary to a low CO and discomfort due to 
refractory edema, ascites, and marked hepatomegaly are common in 
patients with advanced TS and/or TR. In some patients, TS may be sus-
pected for the first time when symptoms of right-sided failure persist 
after an adequate mitral commissurotomy.

(dyssynchrony)

TREATMENT
Tricuspid Stenosis

Patients with TS generally exhibit marked systemic venous conges-
tion; salt restriction, bed rest, and diuretic therapy are required dur-
ing the preoperative period. Such a preparatory period may diminish 
hepatic congestion and thereby improve hepatic function sufficiently 
so that the risks of operation, particularly bleeding, are diminished. 
Surgical relief of the TS should be carried out, preferably at the time 
of  surgical  mitral  commissurotomy  or  mitral  valve  replacement 
(MVR) for mitral valve disease, in patients with moderate or severe 
TS who have mean diastolic pressure gradients exceeding ~4 mmHg 
and tricuspid orifice areas <1.5–2 cm2. TS is almost always accom-
panied  by  significant  TR.  Operative  repair  may  permit  substantial 
improvement of tricuspid valve function. If repair cannot be accom-
plished, the tricuspid valve may have to be replaced. Meta-analysis 
has shown no difference in overall survival between mechanical and 
tissue valve replacement. Mechanical valves in the tricuspid position 
are  more  prone  to  thromboembolic  complications  than  in  other 
positions. Percutaneous tricuspid balloon commissurotomy for iso-
lated severe TS without significant TR is very rarely performed.

Abbreviations: AF, atrial fibrillation; HTN, hypertension; MI, myocardial infarction; 
RV, right ventricular; TVP, tricuspid valve prolapse.

 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
Because  TS  usually  occurs  in  the  presence  of  other  obvious  valvular 
disease,  the  diagnosis  may  be  missed  unless  it  is  considered.  Severe 
TS  is  associated  with  marked  hepatic  congestion,  often  resulting  in 
cirrhosis,  jaundice,  serious  malnutrition,  anasarca,  and  ascites.  Con-
gestive  hepatomegaly  and,  in  cases  of  severe  tricuspid  valve  disease, 
splenomegaly  are  present.  The  jugular  veins  are  distended,  and  in 
patients with sinus rhythm, there may be giant a waves. The v waves 
are  less  conspicuous,  and  because  tricuspid  obstruction  impedes  RA 
emptying  during  diastole,  there  is  a  slow  y  descent.  In  patients  with 
sinus  rhythm,  there  may  be  prominent  presystolic  pulsations  of  the 
enlarged liver as well.

On auscultation, an opening snap (OS) of the tricuspid valve may 
rarely  be  heard  ~0.06  s  after  pulmonic  valve  closure.  The  diastolic 
murmur  of  TS  has  many  of  the  qualities  of  the  diastolic  murmur  of 
MS,  and  because  TS  almost  always  occurs  in  the  presence  of  MS,  it 
may be missed. However, the tricuspid murmur is generally heard best 
along the left lower sternal border and over the xiphoid process and is 
most prominent during presystole in patients with sinus rhythm. The 
murmur of TS is augmented during inspiration, and it is reduced dur-
ing expiration and particularly during the strain phase of the Valsalva 
maneuver, when tricuspid transvalvular flow is reduced.

 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
The  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  features  of  RA  enlargement  (see  
Fig. 240-8) include tall, peaked P waves in lead II, as well as prominent, 
upright P waves in lead V1. The absence of ECG evidence of RV hyper-
trophy (RVH) in a patient with right-sided heart failure who is believed 
to have MS should suggest associated tricuspid valve disease. The chest 
x-ray in patients with combined TS and MS shows particular promi-
nence of the RA and superior vena cava without much enlargement of 
the PA and with less evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion than 
occurs  in  patients  with  isolated  MS;  engorgement  of  the  azygos  vein 
can  often  be  appreciated.  On  transthoracic  echocardiographic  (TTE) 
examination,  the  tricuspid  valve  is  usually  thickened  and  domes  in 
diastole;  the  transvalvular  gradient  can  be  estimated  by  continuous 
wave Doppler echocardiography. Severe TS is characterized by a valve 
area ≤1 cm2 or pressure half-time of ≥190 ms. The RA and inferior vena 
cava (IVC) are enlarged. TTE provides additional information regard-
ing the severity of any associated TR, mitral valve structure and func-
tion, left ventricular (LV) and RV size and function, and PA pressure. 
Cardiac catheterization is not routinely necessary for assessment of TS.

TRICUSPID REGURGITATION
More  than  85%  of  TR  cases  encountered  in  clinical  practice  are  sec-
ondary (functional) in nature and related to tricuspid annular dilation 
and leaflet tethering in the setting of RV remodeling caused by pressure 
or volume overload (or both), myocardial infarction (MI), or trauma 
(Table  266-1).  Secondary  TR  is  commonly  seen  in  the  late  stages  of 
heart failure due to rheumatic or congenital heart disease with severe 
PA hypertension (PA systolic pressure >55 mmHg), as well as in other 
types  of  left-sided  valvular  (e.g.,  mitral  regurgitation)  or  myocardial 
diseases  (e.g.,  ischemic  and  idiopathic  dilated  cardiomyopathies). 
Secondary  TR  can  also  develop  from  chronic  RV  apical  pacing  and 
dyssynchronous contraction; in some patients, the RV leads may also 
perforate or entrap the TV leaflets. TR can often emerge in the setting 
of  new-onset  atrial  fibrillation  (AF),  particularly  in  older  patients 
(atrial  functional  TR).  Rheumatic  fever  may  produce  primary  TR, 
often  associated  with  TS.  Tricuspid  valve  prolapse,  carcinoid  heart 
disease, endomyocardial fibrosis, radiation, infective endocarditis, and 
leaflet trauma can also produce primary TR. Less commonly, primary 
TR results from congenitally deformed tricuspid valves and can occur 
with defects of the atrioventricular canal, as well as with Ebstein’s mal-
formation of the tricuspid valve (Chap. 269).
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The incompetent tricuspid valve allows blood to flow backward from the 
RV into the RA, the volume of which is dependent on the driving pressure 
(i.e., RV systolic pressure) and the size of the regurgitant orifice. The severity 
and physical signs of TR can vary as a function of PA systolic pressure (in 
the absence of RV outflow tract stenosis), the dimension of the tricuspid 
valve annulus, the respiratory cycle-dependent changes in RV preload, and 
RA compliance. RV filling is increased during inspiration. Forward CO is 
reduced and does not augment with exercise. Significant degrees of TR will 
lead to RA enlargement and elevation of the RA and jugular venous pres-
sures with prominent c-v waves in the pulse tracings. Progressively severe 
TR can lead to “ventricularization” of the RA wave form (see Fig. 239-1B). 
Severe TR is also characterized by RV dilation (RV volume overload) and 
eventual systolic dysfunction, the progression of which can be accelerated 
by  a  concomitant  pressure  load  from  PA  hypertension  or  by  myocardial 
fibrosis from previous injury.
 ■ SYMPTOMS
Mild or moderate degrees of TR are usually well tolerated in the absence 
of  other  hemodynamic  disturbances.  Because  TR  most  often  coexists 
with  left-sided  valve  lesions,  LV  dysfunction,  and/or  PA  hypertension, 
symptoms  related  to  these  lesions  may  dominate  the  clinical  picture. 
Fatigue and exertional dyspnea owing to reduced forward CO are early 
symptoms  of  isolated,  severe  TR.  As  the  disease  progresses  and  RV

function  declines,  patients  may  report  cervical  pulsations,  abdominal 
fullness/bloating,  diminished  appetite,  and  muscle  wasting,  although 
with progressive weight gain and painful swelling of the lower extremities.
 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
The neck veins in patients with severe TR are distended with prominent 
c-v waves and rapid y descents (in the absence of TS). TR is more often 
diagnosed by examination of the neck veins than by auscultation of the 
heart  sounds.  Other  findings  may  include  marked  hepatomegaly  with 
systolic pulsations, ascites, pleural effusions, edema, and a positive hepa-
tojugular reflux sign. A prominent RV pulsation in the left parasternal 
region and a blowing holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal 
margin, which may be intensified during inspiration (Carvallo’s sign) and 
reduced during expiration or the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, 
are characteristic findings. The murmur of TR may sometimes be con-
fused with that of mitral regurgitation (MR) unless attention is paid to its 
variation during the respiratory cycle and the extent of RV enlargement 
is appreciated. AF is usually present in the chronic phase of the disease.
 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
The ECG may show changes characteristic of the lesion responsible for 
the TR, e.g., an inferior Q-wave MI suggestive of a prior RV MI, RVH, 
or a bizarre right bundle branch block–type pattern with preexcitation in 
patients with Ebstein’s anomaly. ECG signs of RA enlargement may be 
present in patients with sinus rhythm; AF is frequently noted. The chest 
x-ray may show RA and RV enlargement, depending on the chronicity 

and severity of TR. TTE is usually definitive with demonstration of RA 
dilation  and  RV  volume  overload  and  prolapsing,  flail,  scarred,  or  dis-
placed/tethered  tricuspid  leaflets  with  annular  dilatation;  the  diagnosis 
and assessment of TR can be made by color flow Doppler imaging (see 
Fig.  241-8).  Severe  TR  is  accompanied  by  hepatic  vein  systolic  flow 
reversal. Continuous wave Doppler of the TR velocity profile is useful in 
estimating PA systolic pressure, except when the TR is very severe and 
the  jet  velocity  is  blunted  by  rapidly  increasing  RA  pressure.  Accurate 
assessment of TR severity, PA pressures, and RV size and systolic function 
with TTE can be quite challenging in many patients. Real-time three-di-
mensional  echocardiography  and  cardiac  magnetic  resonance  (CMR) 
imaging  provide  alternative  imaging  modalities,  although  they  are  not 
widely available. In patients with severe TR, the CO is usually markedly 
reduced, and the RA pressure pulse may not exhibit an x descent dur-
ing  early  systole  but  rather  show  a  prominent  c-v  wave  with  a  rapid y 
descent. The mean RA and RV end-diastolic pressures are often elevated. 
Exercise testing can be used to assess functional capacity in patients with 
asymptomatic severe TR. The prognostic significance of exercise-induced 
changes in TR severity and RV function has not been well studied.

helpful because many patients have secondary hyperaldosteronism 
from marked hepatic congestion. Therapies to reduce elevated PA 
pressures and/or pulmonary vascular resistance, including those tar-
geted at left-sided heart disease, can also be considered for patients 
with  PA  hypertension  and  severe  secondary  TR.  Tricuspid  valve 
surgery is recommended for patients with severe TR who are under-
going left-sided valve surgery and is also undertaken frequently for 
treatment  of  even  moderate  TR  in  patients  undergoing  left-sided 
valve  surgery  who  have  tricuspid  annular  dilation  (>40  mm),  a 
history of right heart failure, or PA hypertension. Operation most 
often  comprises  repair  rather  than  replacement  in  these  settings 
and  has  become  routine  in  most  major  surgical  centers.  Surgery 
may also infrequently be required for treatment of severe, primary 
TR  with  right  heart  failure  not  responsive  to  standard  medical 
therapy or because of progressively declining RV systolic function. 
Reported perioperative mortality rates for isolated tricuspid valve 
surgery (repair and replacement) are high (~8–9%) and likely are 
influenced  by  the  hazards  encountered  during  reoperation  on 
patients who have undergone previous left-sided valve surgery and 
have  reduced  RV  function.  Indwelling  pacemaker  or  defibrillator 
leads can also pose technical challenges. Investigation of transcath-
eter tricuspid valve repair and replacement systems is ongoing.

267 Pulmonic Valve Disease

Patrick T. O’Gara, Joseph Loscalzo

PULMONIC STENOSIS
Pulmonic  valve  stenosis  (PS)  is  essentially  a  congenital  disorder  
(Table  267-1).  With  isolated  PS,  the  valve  is  typically  domed.  Dys-
plastic  pulmonic  valves  are  seen  as  part  of  the  Noonan  syndrome  
(Chap. 281), which maps to chromosome 12. Mutations in the PTPN1 
gene are associated with about half of all cases of Noonan syndrome. 
Much  less  common  etiologies  include  carcinoid  and  obstructing 
tumors  or  bulky  vegetations.  The  pulmonic  valve  is  only  very  rarely 
affected by the rheumatic process.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
PS is defined hemodynamically by a systolic pressure gradient between 
the right ventricle (RV) and the main pulmonary artery (PA). RV hyper-
trophy (RVH) develops as a consequence of sustained obstruction to RV 
outflow, and systolic ejection is prolonged. Compared with the ability of 
the LV to compensate for the pressure overload imposed by aortic steno-
sis (AS), RV dysfunction from afterload mismatch occurs earlier in the 
course of PS and at lower peak systolic pressures, because the RV adapts

less  well  to  this  type  of  hemodynamic  burden.  With  normal  systolic 
function and cardiac output (CO), severe PS is defined by a peak sys-
tolic gradient across the pulmonic valve of >64 mmHg (mean gradient  
>35 mm Hg, Doppler jet velocity >4 m/s); moderate PS correlates with 
a peak gradient of 36–64 mmHg (Doppler jet velocity 3-4 m/s). Mild PS 
is characterized by a jet velocity <3 m/s (peak gradient <36 mmHg). PS 
rarely progresses in patients with mild PS mmHg but may worsen in 
those with moderate disease due to valve thickening and calcification 
with age. The right atrial (RA) a wave elevates in relation to the higher 
pressures needed to fill a noncompliant, hypertrophied RV. A promi-
nent RA v wave signifies functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) from 
RV and annular dilation. The CO is maintained until late in the course 
of the disease.
 ■ SYMPTOMS
Patients with mild or even moderate PS are usually asymptomatic and 
first  come  to  medical  attention  because  of  a  heart  murmur  (or  early 
systolic click) that leads to echocardiography. With severe PS, patients 
may  report  exertional  dyspnea  or  early-onset  fatigue.  Anginal  chest 
pain  from  RV  oxygen  supply-demand  mismatch  and  syncope  may 
occur with very severe forms of obstruction, particularly in the pres-
ence of a destabilizing trigger such as atrial fibrillation, fever, infection, 
anemia, or pregnancy.
 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
The  murmur  of  mild  or  moderate  PS  is  mid-systolic  in  timing,  
crescendo–decrescendo in configuration, heard best in the left second 
interspace,  and  usually  introduced  by  an  ejection  sound  (click)  in 
younger adults whose valves are still pliable. The ejection sound is the 
only right-sided acoustic event that decreases in intensity with inspi-
ration. This phenomenon reflects premature opening of the pulmonic 
valve  by  the  elevated  RV  end-diastolic  (post-atrial  a  wave)  pressure. 
The  systolic  murmur  increases  in  intensity  during  inspiration.  With 
progressively  severe  PS,  the  ejection  sound  moves  closer  to  the  first 
heart  sound  and  eventually  becomes  inaudible.  A  right-sided  fourth 
heart  sound  may  emerge.  The  systolic  murmur  peaks  later  and  may 
persist through the aortic component of the second heart sound (A2). 
Pulmonic  valve  closure  is  delayed,  and  the  pulmonic  component  of 
the second heart sound (P2) is reduced or absent. A prominent a wave, 
indicative of the higher atrial pressure necessary to fill the noncompli-
ant RV, may be seen in the jugular venous pulse. A parasternal or RV 
lift can be felt with significant pressure overload. Signs of right heart 
failure, such as hepatomegaly, ascites, and edema, are uncommon but 
may appear very late in the disease.
 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
The electrocardiogram (ECG) will show right axis deviation, RVH, and 
RA enlargement in adult patients with severe PS. Chest x-ray findings 
include poststenotic dilation of the main PA in the frontal plane projec-
tion and filling of the retrosternal airspace due to RV enlargement on

the lateral film. In some patients with RVH, the cardiac apex appears 
to be lifted off the left hemidiaphragm. The RA may also be enlarged. 
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) allows definitive diagnosis and 
characterization in most cases, with depiction of the valve and assess-
ment  of  the  jet  velocity,  gradient,  RV  function,  PA  pressures  (which 
should  be  low),  and  any  associated  cardiac  lesions.  Transesophageal 
echocardiography (TEE) may be useful in some patients for improved 
delineation of the RV outflow tract (RVOT) and assessment of infun-
dibular  hypertrophy.  Cardiac  catheterization  is  not  usually  necessary 
for diagnostic purposes, but if performed, pressures should be obtained 
from  just  below  and  above  the  pulmonic  valve  with  attention  to  the 
possibility that a dynamic component to the gradient may exist. The 
correlation between Doppler assessment of peak instantaneous gradi-
ent and catheterization-measured peak-to-peak gradient is weak. The 
latter may correlate better with the Doppler mean gradient.

not contain a valve. PA pressures in these individuals are not elevated, 
and the diastolic murmur can be misleadingly low pitched and of short 
duration despite significant degrees of PR and RV volume overload.
 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
Depending on both the etiology and severity of PR, the ECG may show 
findings of RVH and RA enlargement. On chest x-ray, the RV and RA 
may  be  enlarged.  Pulmonic  valve  morphology  and  function  can  be 
assessed  with  transthoracic  Doppler  echocardiography.  RV  systolic 
pressure  can  be  estimated  from  the  tricuspid  valve  systolic  jet  veloc-
ity.  Cardiac  magnetic  resonance  (CMR)  imaging  can  provide  greater 
anatomic detail, particularly in patients with repaired congenital heart 
disease, and more precise assessment of RV volumes and function. Car-
diac catheterization is not routinely necessary but would be performed 
as part of a planned transcatheter PV procedure.

TREATMENT
Pulmonic Stenosis

Diuretics  can  be  used  to  treat  symptoms  and  signs  of  right  heart 
failure.  Provided  there  is  less  than  moderate  pulmonic  regurgi-
tation  (PR),  percutaneous  pulmonic  balloon  valvuloplasty  is  rec-
ommended  for  symptomatic  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  PS 
and  for  asymptomatic  patients  with  a  peak  gradient  >64  mmHg 
(or mean gradient >35 mmHg). Surgery may be required when the 
valve is dysplastic (as seen in patients with Noonan’s syndrome and 
other disorders). A multidisciplinary heart team is best positioned 
to make treatment decisions of this nature.

PULMONIC REGURGITATION
PR may develop as a consequence of primary valve pathology, annular 
enlargement, or their combination; after surgical treatment of RVOT 
obstruction  in  children  with  such  disorders  as  tetralogy  of  Fallot;  or 
after  percutaneous  pulmonic  balloon  valvotomy  (Table  267-1).  Car-
cinoid usually causes mixed pulmonic valve disease with PR and PS. 
Long-standing  severe  PA  hypertension  from  any  cause  can  result  in 
dilation of the pulmonic valve ring and PR.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Severe  PR  results  in  RV  chamber  enlargement  and  eccentric  hyper-
trophy.  As  is  the  case  for  aortic  regurgitation  (AR),  PR  is  a  state  of 
increased preload and afterload. The reverse pressure gradient from the 
PA to the RV, which drives the PR, progressively decreases throughout 
diastole and accounts for the decrescendo nature of the diastolic mur-
mur. As RV diastolic pressure increases, the murmur becomes shorter 
in duration. The forward CO is preserved during the early stages of the 
disease but may not increase normally with exercise and declines over 
time.  A  reduction  in  RV  ejection  fraction  may  be  an  early  indicator 
of hemodynamic compromise. In advanced stages, there is significant 
enlargement of the RV and RA with marked elevation of the jugular 
venous pressure.
 ■ SYMPTOMS
Mild or moderate degrees of PR do not, by themselves, result in symp-
toms. Other issues, such as PA hypertension, may dominant the clinical 
picture.  With  progressively  severe  PR  and  RV  dysfunction,  fatigue, 
exertional dyspnea, abdominal fullness/bloating, and lower extremity 
swelling may be reported.
 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
The  physical  examination  hallmark  of  PR  is  a  high-pitched,  decre-
scendo  diastolic  murmur  (Graham  Steell  murmur)  heard  along  the 
left  sternal  border  that  can  be  difficult  to  distinguish  from  the  more 
frequently  appreciated  murmur  of  AR.  The  Graham  Steell  murmur 
may become louder with inspiration and is usually associated with a 
loud and sometimes palpable P2 and an RV lift, as would be expected 
in  patients  with  significant  PA  hypertension  of  any  cause.  Survivors 
of  childhood  surgery  for  tetralogy  of  Fallot  or  PS/pulmonary  atresia 
may have an RV-PA conduit that is freely regurgitant because it does 

TREATMENT
Pulmonic Regurgitation

In patients with functional PR due to PA hypertension and annu-
lar  dilation,  efforts  to  reduce  PA  vascular  resistance  and  pres-
sure should be pursued. Such efforts may include pharmacologic/ 
vasodilator and/or surgical/interventional strategies, depending on 
the cause of the PA hypertension (e.g., idiopathic PA hypertension, 
left-sided  heart  valve  disease).  Diuretics  can  be  used  to  treat  the 
manifestations  of  right  heart  failure.  Surgical  valve  replacement 
for  primary,  severe,  pulmonic  valve  disease,  such  as  carcinoid  or 
endocarditis,  is  rarely  undertaken.  Transcatheter  pulmonic  valve 
replacement has been successfully performed in many patients with 
severe PR after childhood repair of tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonic 
valve stenosis or atresia. This procedure was introduced clinically 
prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Valvular Heart Disease
Patrick T. O’Gara, Joseph Loscalzo

Many  acquired  and  congenital  cardiac  lesions  may  result  in  stenosis 
and/or regurgitation of one or more heart valves. For example, rheu-
matic heart disease can involve the mitral (mitral stenosis [MS], mitral 
regurgitation [MR], or MS and MR), aortic (aortic stenosis [AS], aortic 
regurgitation  [AR],  or  AS  and  AR),  and  tricuspid  (tricuspid  stenosis 
[TS],  tricuspid  regurgitation  [TR],  or  TS  and  TR)  valve,  alone  or  in 
combination.  The  common  association  of  functional  TR  with  sig-
nificant mitral valve disease is discussed in Chap. 266. Severe mitral 
annular  calcification  can  result  in  regurgitation  (due  to  decreased 
annular  shortening  during  systole)  and  mild  or  moderate  stenosis 
(caused by extension of the calcification onto the leaflets resulting in 
restricted valve opening). Patients with severe AS and LV remodeling 
may develop functional MR that may not improve after isolated aortic

2006 valve replacement (AVR). Primary MR due to mitral valve prolapse or 
chordal rupture has been noted in patients with severe AS. Aortic valve 
infective endocarditis (IE) may secondarily involve the mitral appara-
tus either by abscess formation and contiguous spread via the interval-
vular fibrosa or by “drop metastases” from the aortic leaflets onto the 
anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Mediastinal radiation may result in 
aortic, mitral, and even tricuspid valve disease, most often with mixed 
stenosis  and  regurgitation.  Carcinoid  heart  disease  may  cause  mixed 
lesions  of  either  or  both  the  tricuspid  and  pulmonic  valves.  Ergota-
mines, and the previously used combination of fenfluramine and phen-
termine, can rarely result in mixed lesions of the aortic and/or mitral 
valve. Patients with Marfan syndrome may have both AR from aortic 
root dilation and MR due to mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Myxomatous 
degeneration causing prolapse of multiple valves (mitral, aortic, tricus-
pid) can also occur in the absence of an identifiable connective tissue 
disorder. Bicuspid aortic or pulmonic valve disease can result in mixed 
stenosis  and  regurgitation.  The  former  is  also  associated  with  aortic 
aneurysm disease and a predisposition to aortic dissection.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
In  patients  with  multivalvular  heart  disease,  the  pathophysiologic 
derangements  associated  with  the  more  proximal  valve  disease  can 
mask the full expression of the attributes of the more distal valve lesion. 
For example, in patients with rheumatic mitral and aortic valve disease, 
the reduction in cardiac output (CO) imposed by the mitral valve dis-
ease  will  decrease  the  magnitude  of  the  hemodynamic  derangements 
related to the severity of the aortic valve lesion (stenotic, regurgitant, or 
both). Alternatively, the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) during 
the course of MS can lead to sudden worsening in a patient whose aortic 
valve disease was not previously felt to be significant. The development 
of reactive pulmonary vascular disease, sometimes referred to as a “sec-
ondary obstructive lesion in series,” can impose an additional challenge 
in these settings. As CO falls with progressive tricuspid valve disease, the 
severity of any associated mitral or aortic disease can be underestimated.
One of the most common examples of multivalve disease is that of 
functional TR in the setting of significant mitral valve disease. Func-
tional  TR  occurs  as  a  consequence  of  right  ventricular  and  annular 
dilation;  pulmonary  artery  (PA)  hypertension  may  be  present.  The 
tricuspid  leaflets  are  morphologically  normal.  Progressive  degrees  of 
TR lead to right ventricular volume overload and continued chamber 
and  annular  dilation.  The  TR  is  usually  central  in  origin;  reflux  into 
the  right  atrium  (RA)  is  expressed  as  large,  systolic  c-v  waves  in  the 
RA  pressure  pulse.  The  height  of  the  c-v  wave  is  dependent  on  RA 
compliance and the volume of regurgitant flow. The RA waveform may 
become “ventricularized” in advanced stages of chronic, severe TR. CO 
falls and the severity of the associated mitral valve disease may become 
more difficult to appreciate. Findings related to advanced right heart 
failure  (e.g.,  ascites,  edema)  predominate.  Primary  rheumatic  tricus-
pid valve disease may occur with rheumatic mitral disease and cause 
hemodynamic changes reflective of TR, TS, or their combination. With 
TS, the y descent in the RA pressure pulse is prolonged. Typically, find-
ings related to the mitral valve disease predominate over those related 
to the tricuspid valve disease.

Another  example  of  rheumatic,  multivalve  disease  involves  the 
combination of mitral and aortic valve pathology, frequently character-
ized by MS and AR. In isolated MS, left ventricular (LV) preload and 
diastolic  pressure  are  reduced  as  a  function  of  the  severity  of  inflow 
obstruction.  With  concomitant  AR,  however,  LV  filling  is  enhanced 
and diastolic pressure may rise depending on the compliance charac-
teristics of the chamber. Because the CO falls with progressive degrees 
of  MS,  transaortic  valve  flows  will  decline,  masking  the  potential 
severity  of  the  aortic  valve  lesion  (AR,  AS,  or  its  combination).  As 
noted above, onset of AF in such patients can be especially deleterious. 
The loss of atrial systole with AF may result in a critical reduction in 
CO, a rise in LA and LV diastolic pressures, and a further deleterious 
increase in heart rate.

Secondary  (functional)  MR  may  complicate  the  course  of  some 
patients with severe AS. The mitral valve leaflets and chordae tendineae 
are usually normal. Incompetence is related to changes in LV geometry 

(remodeling)  and  abnormal  systolic  tethering  of  the  leaflets  in  the 
context of markedly elevated LV systolic pressures. Relief of the excess 
afterload with surgical or transcatheter AVR may result in reduction of 
the secondary MR. Persistence of significant, secondary MR following 
AVR is associated with impaired functional outcomes and reduced sur-
vival. Identification of patients who would benefit from concomitant 
treatment of their secondary MR at time of AVR is quite challenging. 
Most surgeons advocate for repair of moderate-to-severe or severe sec-
ondary MR at time of surgical AVR. Significant primary MR may also 
coexist with AS and is routinely managed with repair or replacement at 
the time of AVR. There is increasing experience with the combination 
of  transcatheter  aortic  valve  implantation  (TAVI)  and  transcatheter 
edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TEER) in high surgical risk patients 
with severe AS and moderate-severe primary or secondary MR.

In patients with mixed AS and AR, assessment of valve stenosis can 
be influenced by the magnitude of the regurgitant valve flow. Because 
transvalvular  systolic  flow  velocities  are  augmented  in  patients  with 
AR and preserved LV systolic function, the LV-aortic Doppler-derived 
pressure gradient and the intensity of the systolic murmur will be ele-
vated to values higher than expected for the true systolic valve orifice 
size  as  measured  by  planimetry.  Uncorrected,  the  Gorlin  formula, 
which relies on forward CO (systolic transvalvular flow) and the mean 
pressure  gradient  for  calculation  of  valve  area,  is  not  accurate  in  the 
setting  of  mixed  aortic  valve  disease.  Similar  considerations  apply  to 
patients with mixed mitral valve disease. The peak mitral valve Dopp-
ler E wave velocity (v0) is increased in the setting of severe MR because 
of  enhanced  early  diastolic  flow  and  may  not  accurately  reflect  the 
contribution to left atrial (LA) hypertension from any associated MS. 
When either AR or MR is the dominant lesion in patients with mixed 
aortic or mitral valve disease, respectively, the LV is dilated. When AS 
or MS predominates, LV chamber size will be normal or small. It can 
sometimes  be  difficult  to  ascertain  whether  stenosis  or  regurgitation 
is the dominant lesion in patients with mixed valve disease, although 
an integrated clinical and noninvasive assessment can usually provide 
clarification  for  purposes  of  patient  management.  For  patients  with 
moderate, mixed AS and AR in whom stenosis is the dominant lesion, 
the natural history tends to parallel what might be expected for isolated 
severe AS, and the treatment approach should be accordingly aligned.
Patients with significant AS, a nondilated LV chamber, and concen-
tric  hypertrophy  will  poorly  tolerate  the  abrupt  development  of  aortic 
regurgitation, as may occur, for example, with IE or after surgical AVR 
or TAVI complicated by paravalvular leakage. The noncompliant LV is 
not prepared to accommodate the sudden volume load, and as a result, 
LV  diastolic  pressure  rises  rapidly  and  severe  heart  failure  develops. 
Indeed, paravalvular regurgitation is a significant risk factor for short- 
to intermediate-term death following transcatheter AVR. Conditions in 
which the LV may not be able to dilate in response to chronic AR (or 
MR) include radiation heart disease and, in some patients, the cardiomy-
opathy associated with obesity and diabetes. Noncompliant ventricles of 
small chamber size predispose to earlier onset diastolic dysfunction and 
heart failure in response to any further perturbation in valve function.

 ■ SYMPTOMS
Compared  with  patients  with  isolated,  single-lesion  valve  disease, 
patients with multiple or mixed valve disease may develop symptoms at 
a relatively earlier stage in the natural history of their disease. Symptoms 
such as exertional dyspnea and fatigue are usually related to elevated 
filling pressures, reduced CO, or their combination. Palpitations may 
signify AF and identify mitral valve disease as an important compo-
nent of the clinical presentation, even when not previously suspected. 
Chest pain compatible with angina could reflect left or right ventricular 
oxygen  supply/demand  mismatch  on  a  substrate  of  hypertrophy  and  
pressure/volume  overload  with  or  without  superimposed  coronary 
artery  disease.  Symptoms  related  to  right  heart  failure  (abdominal 
fullness/bloating, edema) are late manifestations of advanced disease.

 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
Mixed disease of a single valve is most often manifested by systolic and 
diastolic murmurs, each with the attributes expected for the valve in

question. Thus, patients with AS and AR will have characteristic mid-
systolic,  crescendo-decrescendo  and  blowing,  decrescendo  diastolic 
murmurs  at  the  base  of  the  heart  in  the  second  right  interspace  and 
along the left sternal edge, respectively. Many patients with significant 
AR have mid-systolic outflow murmurs even in the absence of valve 
sclerosis/stenosis, and other findings of AS must be sought. The sepa-
rate murmurs of AS and AR can occasionally be difficult to distinguish 
from the continuous murmurs associated with either a patent ductus 
arteriosus (PDA) or ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. With mixed 
aortic valve disease, the systolic murmur should end before, and not 
envelope or extend through, the second heart sound (S2). The murmur 
associated with a PDA is heard best to the left of the upper sternum. 
The  continuous  murmur  heard  with  a  ruptured  sinus  of  Valsalva 
aneurysm is often first appreciated after an episode of acute chest pain. 
An  early  ejection  click,  which  usually  defines  bicuspid  aortic  valve 
disease in young adults, is often not present in patients with congenital 
mixed AS and AR. As noted above, both the intensity and duration of 
these separate murmurs can be influenced by a reduction in CO and 
transvalvular  flow  due  to  coexistent  mitral  valve  disease.  In  patients 
with isolated MS and MR, expected findings would include a blowing, 
holosystolic murmur and a mid-diastolic rumble (with or without an 
opening snap) best heard at the cardiac apex. An irregularly irregular 
heart rhythm in such patients would likely signify AF. Findings with 
TS and TR would mimic those of left-sided MS and MR, save for the 
expected  changes  in  the  murmurs  with  respiration.  The  murmurs  of 
pulmonic stenosis and regurgitation behave in a fashion directionally 
similar to AS and AR; dynamic changes during respiration should be 
noted.  Specific  attributes  of  these  cardiac  murmurs  are  reviewed  in 
Chaps. 42 and 266.

 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
The  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  may  show  evidence  of  ventricular 
hypertrophy and/or atrial enlargement. ECG signs indicative of right-
sided  cardiac  abnormalities  in  patients  with  left-sided  valve  lesions 
should  prompt  additional  assessment  for  PA  hypertension  and/or 
right-sided  valve  disease.  The  presence  of  AF  in  patients  with  aortic 
valve disease may be a clue to the presence of previously unsuspected 
mitral  valve  disease  in  the  appropriate  context.  The  chest  x-ray  can 
be reviewed for evidence of cardiac chamber enlargement, valve and/
or  annular  calcification,  and  any  abnormalities  in  the  appearance  of 
the  pulmonary  vasculature.  The  latter  could  include  enlargement  of 
the main and proximal pulmonary arteries with PA hypertension and 
pulmonary venous redistribution/engorgement or Kerley B lines with 
increasing degrees of LA hypertension. An enlarged azygos vein in the 
frontal projection indicates RA hypertension. Roentgenographic find-
ings not expected based on a single or mixed valve lesion may reflect 
other valve disease.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the most commonly used 
imaging  modality  for  the  diagnosis  and  characterization  of  multiple 
and/or  mixed  valvular  heart  disease  and  may  often  demonstrate 
findings  not  clinically  suspected.  Transesophageal  echocardiography 
(TEE)  may  sometimes  be  required  for  more  accurate  assessment  of 
valve anatomy (specifically, the mitral valve) and when IE is considered 
responsible  for  the  clinical  presentation.  TTE  findings  of  particular 
interest include those related to valve morphology and function, cal-
cification, chamber size, ventricular wall thickness, biventricular func-
tion  estimated  PA  systolic  pressure,  and  the  dimensions  of  the  great 
vessels, including the root and ascending aorta, PA, and inferior vena 
cava. Exercise testing (with or without echocardiography) can be useful 
when the degree of functional limitation reported by the patient is not 
adequately  explained  by  the  findings  on  TTE  performed  at  rest.  An 
integrated assessment of the clinical and TTE findings is needed to help 
determine  the  dominant  valve  lesion(s)  and  establish  an  appropriate 
plan for treatment and follow-up. Natural history is usually influenced 
to a relatively greater degree by the dominant lesion.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can be used to provide 
additional  anatomic  and  physiologic  information  when  echocardiog-
raphy  proves  suboptimal  but  is  less  well  suited  to  the  evaluation  of 
valve morphology. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) has been used 

to assess intracardiac structures in patients with complicated IE. It is 
invaluable in planning for transcatheter valve implantation. Coronary 
CT  angiography  provides  a  noninvasive  alternative  for  the  assess-
ment  of  coronary  artery  anatomy  prior  to  surgery  or  transcatheter 
intervention.

Invasive  hemodynamic  evaluation  with  right  and  left  heart  cathe-
terization may be required to characterize more completely the indi-
vidual contributions of each lesion in patients with either multiple or 
mixed valvular heart disease. It is strongly recommended when there 
is  a  discrepancy  between  the  clinical  and  noninvasive  findings  in  a 
symptomatic  patient.  Measurement  of  PA  pressures  and  calculation 
of  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  (PVR)  can  help  inform  clinical  
decision-making in certain patient subsets, such as those with advanced 
mitral and tricuspid valve disease. It is important to identify any poten-
tial contribution to the clinical picture from pulmonary vascular dis-
ease. Attention to the accurate assessment of CO is essential. Coronary 
angiography (if indicated) can be performed as part of the procedure. 
Contrast ventriculography and great vessel angiography are performed 
infrequently.

TREATMENT
Multiple and Mixed Valve Disease

Management of patients with multiple or mixed valve disease can be 
challenging. As noted above, it is helpful to determine the dominant 
valve lesion and proceed according to the treatment and follow-up 
recommendations for it (Chaps. 261–267), being mindful of devi-
ations from the expected course due to the contributions of more 
than one valve lesion. For example, AF that emerges in the course 
of  moderate  mitral  valve  disease  may  precipitate  heart  failure  in 
patients with concomitant, severe aortic valve disease that was pre-
viously asymptomatic.

Medical  therapies  are  limited  and  include  diuretics  when 
indicated  for  relief  of  congestion  and  anticoagulation  to  prevent 
stroke and thromboembolism in patients with AF. Blood pressure– 
lowering  medications  may  be  needed  to  treat  systemic  hyperten-
sion, which may aggravate left-sided regurgitant valve lesions, but 
should be initiated and titrated carefully. Pulmonary vasodilators to 
lower PVR are not generally effective in this context.

There is a paucity of evidence to inform practice guidelines for 
surgical  and/or  transcatheter  valve  intervention  in  patients  with 
multiple  or  mixed  valve  disease.  When  there  is  a  clear,  dominant 
lesion,  as  for  example  in  a  patient  with  severe  AS  and  mild  AR, 
indications  for  intervention  are  straightforward  and  follow  those 
recommended for patients with AS (Chap. 261). In other patients, 
however, there is less clarity, and decisions regarding intervention 
should be based on several considerations, including those related 
to lesion severity, ventricular remodeling, functional capacity, and 
PA pressures. In this regard, it is important to realize that patients 
with  multiple  and/or  mixed  valve  disease  may  develop  limiting 
symptoms or signs of physiologic impairment even with moderate 
valve lesions.

Concomitant  aortic  and  mitral  valve  replacement  surgery  is 
associated  with  a  significantly  higher  perioperative  mortality  risk 
than  replacement  of  either  valve  alone,  and  operation  should  be 
carefully  considered.  Double  valve  replacement  surgery  is  usually 
performed  for  treatment  of  severe  (unrepairable)  valve  disease  at 
both  locations  and  for  the  combination  of  severe  disease  at  one 
location with moderate disease at the other to avoid the hazards of 
reoperation in the intermediate to late term for progressive disease 
of  the  unoperated  valve.  In  addition,  the  presence  of  a  prosthesis 
in the aortic position significantly restricts surgical exposure of the 
native mitral valve. The need for double valve replacement may also 
impact the decision regarding the type of prosthesis (i.e., mechan-
ical vs tissue).

Tricuspid valve repair for moderate or severe secondary (func-
tional)  TR  at  the  time  of  left-sided  valve  surgery  is  now  com-
monplace, particularly if there is dilation of the tricuspid annulus

(>40  mm).  The  addition  of  tricuspid  valve  repair,  consisting  usually 
of insertion of an annuloplasty ring, adds little time or complexity to 
the procedure and is well tolerated. Reoperation for repair (or replace-
ment) of progressive TR years after initial surgery for left-sided valve 
disease, on the other hand, is associated with a relatively high perioper-
ative mortality risk. Mitral valve repair or replacement for moderate or 
severe secondary MR at time of AVR for AS can usually be undertaken 
with acceptable risk for perioperative death or major complication.

The presence of moderate or severe MR in patients with rheu-
matic MS is a contraindication to percutaneous mitral balloon com-
missurotomy (PMBC). TAVI can be performed for mixed AS and 
AR  when  the  anatomic  findings  related  to  annulus  size,  coronary 
height, and the distribution of calcium are favorable. Transcatheter 
management  of  both  severe  AS  and  severe  primary  or  secondary 
MR (with deployment of an edge-to-edge clip) has been undertaken 
with  increasing  frequency  in  appropriately  selected  patients  with 
prohibitive or high surgical risk. Further advances in transcatheter 
treatments for multiple and mixed valve disease are anticipated.

269 Congenital Heart Disease  

in the Adult
Anne Marie Valente, Michael J. Landzberg

 ■ PREVALENCE
The  number  of  adults  with  congenital  heart  disease  (CHD)  living  in 
the United States is estimated to be at least 1.4 million, with just over 
one in five having a complex form of CHD. The majority of adults with 
CHD were diagnosed in childhood, although a substantial percentage 
may have CHD first recognized as adults. Lifelong follow-up in coordi-
nation with, or directly by, clinicians with expertise in adult congenital 
heart disease (ACHD) is recommended. In this chapter, we will review 
the current field of ACHD, with an introduction to CHD nomenclature 
and cardiac development. This is followed by a summary of the more 
common  CHD  lesions  that  may  be  diagnosed  in  adulthood.  Lastly, 
some  of  the  common  repaired  CHD  lesions  that  are  encountered  in 
adults are discussed. Throughout the chapter, to aid in the understand-
ing of congenital cardiac anatomy and physiology, we include figures 
displaying the passage of blood flow between blood vessels and cardiac 
chambers in various disorders (Fig. 269-1).

 ■ THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF ADULT CHD
A  Relatively  New  Subspecialty  in  Cardiovascular  Disease  
Over the past decade, the field of caring for adults with CHD (ACHD) 
has blossomed, and several nationwide initiatives have been initiated 
in an attempt to standardize care. The American College of Cardiology 
and American Heart Association developed guidelines for the care of 
adults with CHD, first published in 2008 and revised in 2018. These 
guidelines emphasize the need for collaboration among primary care 
practitioners, cardiologists, and ACHD subspecialty cardiologists. The 

body of medical knowledge and competencies attendant with ACHD 
combined with skill acquisition in coordination of complex care over 
a  patient’s  medical  lifetime  led  in  2015  to  ACHD  board  certification 
examinations by the American Board of Medical Subspecialties, as well 
as the establishment of requirements for advanced fellowship training 
in  ACHD  care  by  the  Accreditation  Council  for  Graduate  Medical 
Education. In temporal association, the Adult Congenital Heart Asso-
ciation (ACHA) developed a process for ACHD care program accred-
itation  based  on  standardization  of  infrastructural  components  felt 
requisite to achieve quality outcomes for ACHD.
 ■ SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE ACHD 
PATIENT
Adults with CHD may not recognize subtle changes in their exercise 
capacity, some of which are associated with worse survival; by the time 
symptoms  are  recognized,  irreversible  physiologic  changes  may  have 
occurred.  ACHD  patients  are,  therefore,  advised  to  undergo  regular 
evaluations  for  surveillance  of  anatomic,  hemodynamic,  and  electro-
physiologic  sequelae  that  may  be  present.  In  addition,  specific  situa-
tions  may  arise  in  which  it  is  prudent  to  review  care  in  consultation 
with an ACHD specialist, several of which are outlined below.

Non-Cardiac Surgery  Nearly all adults with CHD can be classi-
fied with stage A (harboring risk) or greater degrees of heart failure. 
As  such,  adults  with  CHD  may  demonstrate  limited  hemodynamic 
reserve to altered myocardial perfusion or loading conditions and may 
have subclinical organ dysfunction that is not recognized by standard 
laboratory assessment. Comprehensive, multispecialty assessment and 
care strategy review are recommended in advance of invasive or oper-
ative procedures for adults with CHD. Table 269-1 lists the multiorgan 
considerations that should be considered in adults with CHD during 
perioperative  resuscitation  and  convalescence.  Anesthetic  manage-
ment  requires  particular  knowledge  of  anatomy,  physiologic  conse-
quence  of  underlying  defects,  myocardial  and  vascular  performance, 
presence  and  nature  of  previous  palliative  procedures  and  residual 
shunts, alteration of venous or arterial pathways within the circulation, 
and status of noncardiovascular organ physiology.

Pregnancy  Women with CHD should receive counseling regarding 
both  maternal  and  fetal  risks  prior  to  conceiving  a  pregnancy  and 
should  be  cared  for  in  institutions  with  experience  in  treating  CHD 
during pregnancy. Preconception evaluation includes detailed medical 
history,  with  particular  attention  to  the  women’s  functional  capacity, 
which  is  closely  linked  to  maternal  and  fetal  outcomes.  Table  269-2 
lists the World Health Organization classification of risk during preg-
nancy in women with heart disease; women at risk should be strongly 
counseled about the significant risks of morbidity and mortality during 
pregnancy  and  the  postpartum  period.  Normal  physiologic  hemody-
namic changes of pregnancy are significant, occur over a relatively con-
densed period of time, and may be compounded in adults with CHD. 
Silversides  and  colleagues  have  developed  a  weighted-risk  score  for 
pregnant women with heart disease, based on a large registry known 
as CARPREG 2. The highest-weighted risk factors (weight of 3 points) 
include  a  prior  history  of  cardiac  events  or  arrhythmias,  decreased 
functional  status  (New  York  Heart  Association  class  ≥III),  and  pres-
ence of a mechanical heart valve. Risk factors that account for 2 points 
include ventricular dysfunction, high-risk left-sided valve disease/left 
ventricular outflow tract obstruction, pulmonary hypertension, coro-
nary  artery  disease,  and  high-risk  aortopathy.  One  point  is  assigned 
for late pregnancy assessment or no prior cardiac intervention. In this 
cohort, 16% of women experienced an adverse cardiac outcome, pri-
marily heart failure and arrhythmia related. The predicted risks for car-
diac events stratified according to point score were as follows: ≤1 point, 
5%; 2 points, 10%; 3 points, 15%; 4 points, 22%; and >4 points, 41%.

Prepregnancy  medications  should  be  reviewed  to  ensure  their 
safety  in  pregnancy.  Alternatives  to  angiotensin-converting  enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and endothelin recep-
tor  blockers  should  be  considered,  as  these  agents  are  teratogenic 
and  contraindicated  during  pregnancy  and  should  be  discontinued. 
Women requiring anticoagulation must be advised of the challenges of

chamber or vascular pressures, oxygen saturations) can aid in representation. Ao, aorta; IVC, inferior vena cava; LA, left

are joined together by the atrioventricu-
lar canal and the conus (infundibulum). 
In  the  normal  heart,  the  right  ventri-
cle  (RV)  is  right-sided  and  organized 
inflow-to-outflow  from  right  to  left, 
while the left ventricle (LV) is left-sided 
and  organized  inflow-to-outflow  from  
left to right. It is important to determine 
the segmental alignments, that is, what 
drains  into  what.  For  example,  in  the 
normal  heart,  the  right  atrium  (RA)  is 
aligned  with  the  RV  and  the  LV  with 
the  aorta.  Finally,  the  segmental  con-
nections,  the  way  in  which  adjacent 
segments  are  physically  linked  to  each 
other,  are  described.  For  example,  in 
the normal heart, the pulmonary artery 
(PA) is connected to the RV by a com-
plete  muscular  conus  (infundibulum), 
while  the  aorta  is  connected  to  the 
LV  by  aortic-mitral  fibrous  continuity 
(without a complete conus). Alignment 
and  connection  are  different  concepts 
and  both  are  important,  especially  in 
complex defects.

managing anticoagulation during pregnancy, and individualized strat-
egies should be developed. A fetal echocardiogram between 18 and 22 
weeks of gestation is advised for patients with CHD. Additionally, both 
men and women with CHD should be counseled regarding the risk of 
CHD in their offspring.
 ■ CONGENITAL TERMINOLOGY, DEVELOPMENT, 
AND GENETICS
Congenital  Nomenclature  One  of  the  challenges  in  caring  for 
adults with CHD is the inconsistent terminology used to describe the 
congenital heart lesions. Several classification systems have been pro-
posed, from the initial descriptions by Maude Abbott, Maurice Lev, and 
Jesse Edwards, to the extensive characterizations by Stella and Richard 
Van Praagh and Robert Anderson. In this chapter, we follow a segmental 
approach. The heart is composed of several segments that are analyzed 
separately before formulating a comprehensive diagnosis. The princi-
pal segments are the atria, the ventricles, and the great arteries, which

Cardiac  Development  The  heart 
starts  to  form  in  the  third  week  of 
gestation and is nearly fully formed by 
8 weeks’ gestation. Mesodermal precar-
diac  cells  migrate  to  form  the  cardiac 
crescents  (primary  heart  fields)  in  anterior  lateral  plate  mesoderm, 
which are then brought together to form a primary linear heart tube by 
ventral closure of the embryo. Cells of the second heart field continue 
to  proliferate  outside  the  heart  and  are  added  to  the  heart  tube  over 
the  course  of  embryogenesis,  contributing  to  the  atria,  the  RV,  and 
outflow tract. Additionally, cardiac neural crest cells migrate into the 
developing heart in the 5th–6th weeks and are essential for septation 
of  the  outflow,  formation  of  the  semilunar  valves,  and  patterning  of 
the  aortic  arches.  Once  formed,  the  heart  tube  grows  and  elongates 
by addition of cells from the second heart field. The ends of the heart 
tube are relatively fixed by the pericardial sac so that as it elongates it 
must loop (bend), and in the vast majority of hearts, the loop falls to 
the right (D-loop). Further elongation pushes the mid-portion of the 
tube (future ventricles) inferior or caudal to the inflow, resulting in the 
normal relationship between the atria and ventricles. Further growth 
pushes  the  outflow  medially  and  is  associated  with  outflow  rotation, 
both processes essential for normal alignment of the outflow. Finally, 
the proximal part of the outflow is incorporated in the RV, shortening 
the outflow in association with further rotation. While this remodeling 
is occurring, the outflow is undergoing septation under the influence 
of cardiac neural crest cells. Septation proceeds from distal to proximal, 
culminating in formation and muscularization of the infundibular, or 
muscular, outflow septum, which inserts onto the superior endocardial 
cushion at the rightward rim of the outflow foramen, walling the aorta 
into the LV via the outflow foramen and the PA directly into the RV.
Genetic  Considerations  CHD  is  the  most  commonly  occur-
ring  birth  defect;  etiologic  contributors  are  increasingly  recognized, 
although  often  speculated  to  be  multifactorial.  Children  born  with 
trisomy 21 have a 50% chance of having CHD, most commonly defects 
in the atrioventricular canal. Conotruncal defects are associated with 
a  number  of  chromosomal  abnormalities,  most  notably  a  deletion  at 
chromosome  22q11  (DiGeorge  syndrome).  Echocardiographic  clues 
to  this  association  in  patients  with  a  conotruncal  defect  include  an 
associated right aortic arch or aberrant subclavian artery. Many adults 
currently living with conotruncal defects may not have undergone test-
ing for DiGeorge syndrome. This condition is important to recognize 
because a variety of psychiatric disorders and disabilities in cognitive 
function  may  be  present  and  go  untreated.  Patients  with  Noonan

have been associated with Noonan syndrome, most notably PTPN11. 
Adults  with  Williams  syndrome  (7q11.23  deletion)  commonly  have 
supravalvar  aortic  stenosis  and  diffuse  arteriopathy,  with  a  “cocktail-
like” personality and hypercalcemia. There is a growing importance of 
genome-wide analyses in subjects with CHD.

 ■ SPECIFIC CHD LESIONS
Dilated  Right  Heart  There  are  many  congenital  etiologies  for 
right  heart  dilation  (Table  269-3).  These  include  congenital  valvular 
anomalies  (such  as  Ebstein  anomaly  or  pulmonary  regurgitation), 
intrinsic  RV  myocardial  anomalies  (arrhythmogenic  RV  dysplasia, 
Uhl’s  anomaly),  or  shunt  lesions  occurring  proximal  to  the  tricuspid 
valve. Cardiac imaging is critical in determining the etiology of right 
heart dilation, and knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of vari-
ous shunt lesions is essential.

Atrial  Septal  Defect  One  of  the  most  common  etiologies  of  right 
heart  dilation  is  presence  of  an  atrial  septal  defect  (ASD;  Fig.  269-2A). 
  Intracardiac  communications  allow  blood  transmission  between 
chambers or spaces based on relative resistance, propulsion, and flow 
patterns. Patients with large ASDs often present in childhood; however, 
many  ASDs  are  not  discovered  until  adult  life.  The  physiology  of  an 
ASD is predominantly that of a “left-to-right” shunt (flow of pulmo-
nary venous, or oxygenated, blood toward systemic venous, or deox-
ygenated,  chambers  or  vessels).  The  degree  of  left-to-right  shunting 
determines the amount of right heart volume loading and is dictated by 
the size of the defect as well as the diastolic properties of the heart. As 
patients age, several factors, such as diabetes mellitus, systemic hyper-
tension, and atherosclerosis, may contribute to decreased compliance 
of the left-sided cardiac chambers and contribute to increased left-to-
right shunting and symptomatology. The classic physical examination 
finding  is  a  wide,  fixed  splitting  of  the  second  heart  sound,  which  is 

due to prolonged RV ejection and increased PA capacitance, which, in 
turn,  delay  pulmonary  valve  closure.  The  surface  electrocardiogram 
(ECG) commonly displays an incomplete right bundle branch block. 
Symptoms, when they occur, most commonly include exercise intoler-
ance, arrhythmia, and dyspnea with exertion. It is not uncommon for 
adults to have incidentally noted asymptomatic ASD during evaluation 
of other comorbid issues. Right heart dilation, without additional eti-
ology for such, in the setting of unrepaired ASD is considered a risk 
for progression toward symptomatic right heart failure, atrial arrhyth-
mias,  and  potential  development  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension 
(if such is not already present). Therefore, a patient with an ASD and 
right  heart  dilation,  particularly  with  symptoms  attributable  to  such, 
should  be  offered  ASD  closure.  Pulmonary  vascular  disease  leading 
to  pulmonary  hypertension  develops  in  up  to  10%  of  patients  with 
unrepaired ASD, and Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) is a rare complica-
tion (see below). Management of patients with concomitant ASD and 
pulmonary hypertension should be coordinated with both ACHD and 
pulmonary hypertension experts.

Figure 269-2B illustrates the locations of various ASDs. The most 
common  type  of  an  ASD  is  a  secundum  ASD,  which  is  a  defect,  or 
true deficiency in the atrial septum, in the region of the fossa ovalis. 
This  should  be  differentiated  from  a  patent  foramen  ovale  (PFO), 
which is persistence of patency of the flap valve of the fossa ovalis (not 
associated with right-sided cardiac dilation) and persists in up to 25% 
of adults. Secundum ASDs can often be closed with occluder devices 
placed percutaneously. However, certain anatomic determinants make 
percutaneous closure less favorable, including large defects, inadequate 
tissue  rims  surrounding  the  defect,  and  concomitance  of  anomalous 
draining pulmonary veins. A primum ASD is a deficiency of the atri-
oventricular (AV) canal portion of the atrial septum; primum ASD is 
always associated with abnormal development of the AV valves, most 
commonly  resulting  in  a  cleft  in  the  mitral  valve.  A  coronary  sinus 
defect  is  rare  and  involves  an  opening  between  the  coronary  sinus 
and the left atrium. A sinus venosus defect is not a defect in the atrial

septum  but,  rather,  a  defect  between  either  the  right  superior  vena 
caval–atrial  junction  and  the  right  upper  pulmonary  vein(s)  or,  less 
commonly, the inferior vena caval–atrial junction and the right lower 
pulmonary veins. Surgical closure is required for primum ASDs, sinus 
venosus defects, and coronary sinus septal defects.

Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return  Partial anom-
alous  pulmonary  venous  return  (PAPVR)  is  occasionally  discovered 
in  adults  with  right  heart  dilation  or  incidentally  on  cross-sectional 
imaging  (Fig.  269-3).  There  are  several  possible  anomalous  connec-
tions,  with  the  most  common  being  a  left  upper  pulmonary  vein  to 
an ascending vertical vein into the innominate vein or the right upper 
pulmonary vein draining to the superior vena cava. In the latter case, 
careful attention should be paid to ensure that there is not an associated 
sinus venosus defect. Concomitant pulmonary hypertension can occur 
but is uncommon. Symptomatology may be absent, and a decision to 
repair isolated PAPVR should include variance in anatomy, lung venti-
lation and perfusion, hemodynamic response to shunt, symptoms, and 
surgical experience.

Ebstein  Anomaly  Ebstein  anomaly  (Fig.  269-4)  is  the  result  of 
embryologic failure of delamination, or “peeling away,” of the tricuspid 
valve leaflets from the ventricular myocardium, resulting in adherence 
of  the  valve  leaflets  to  the  underlying  myocardium.  This  results  in  a 
wide variety of abnormalities, including apical and posterior displace-
ment of the dilated tricuspid valve annulus, dilation of the “atrialized” 
portion  of  the  RV,  and  fenestrations,  redundancy,  and  tethering 
typically of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The malformed 
tricuspid valve is usually regurgitant, but may occasionally be stenotic. 
The clinical presentation of Ebstein anomaly in the adult depends on 
several  factors,  including  the  extent  of  tricuspid  valve  leaflet  distor-
tion, degree of tricuspid regurgitation (TR), right atrial pressure, and 
presence of an atrial level shunt. The physical examination of a patient 
with Ebstein anomaly may vary depending on the severity of disease. 
In more severe cases, the first heart sound may be split and the second 
component  of  the  first  heart  sound  may  have  a  distinctive  snapping 
quality (known as the sail sign, due to the redundancy of the anterior 
tricuspid valve leaflet). Patients with significant TR may have promi-
nent “v” waves of the jugular venous pulsations; however, this finding 
is  often  absent  due  to  abnormal  right  atrial  compliance.  The  ECG  is 
often  abnormal,  with  right  atrial  and  ventricular  enlargement.  Up  to 
20%  of  patients  have  evidence  of  ventricular  preexcitation  (Wolff- 
Parkinson-White  pattern).  Surgical  treatment  includes  a  tricuspid 
valve  repair  or  replacement,  closure  of  any  atrial  level  defects,  and 
arrhythmia ablative procedures.

Shunt  Lesions  Causing  Left  Heart  Dilation 
Intracardiac 
shunts or intravascular passages that occur below the level of the tricus-
pid valve result in left heart dilation. The two major types of congenital 
shunts that result in left heart dilation are a ventricular septal defect 
(VSD; Fig. 269-5A) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA; Fig. 269-6).

Ventricular Septal Defects  VSDs are the most common congen-
ital anomaly recognized at birth; however, they account for only ~10% 
of  CHD  in  the  adult,  due  to  the  high  rate  of  spontaneous  closure  of 
small  VSDs  during  the  early  years  of  life.  Large  VSDs  usually  cause 
symptoms of heart failure and poor somatic growth and are most often 
surgically  closed  before  adulthood.  Several  classification  systems  for 
VSDs  exist.  Figure  269-5B  illustrates  various  locations  of  VSDs;  the 
most  common  location  is  in  the  membranous  septum  (also  referred

FIGURE  269-3  Partial  anomalous  pulmonary  venous  return.  In  the  presence  of  an  anomalously  draining 
pulmonary  vein  (typically  to  a  systemic  vein  such  as  the  left  innominate  vein,  SVC,  or  rarely  IVC),  an 
obligate  “shunt”  of  flow  (“y”)  of  “red”  (oxygenated)  blood  from  the  affected  pulmonary  vein  to  the  right 
heart (deoxygenated) ensues. Systemic venous return of pure deoxygenated blood (“x”) is increased by the 
oxygenated shunted blood (“y”) to increase volume of blood (“x + y”) in the SVC, RA, RV, and total blood flow to 
the lungs. If the volume or the sequelae of the shunted blood is sufficient, RA and RV can dilate (hashed lines), 
or shortness of breath can ensue. Ao, aorta; APV, anomalous pulmonary vein; IVC, inferior vena cava; LA, left

the VSD. Up to 10% of patients with TOF have 
an anomalous coronary artery, most commonly, 
an anomalous left anterior descending coronary 
artery  from  the  right  coronary  cusp.  Patients 
with an anomalous coronary as well as those with 
TOF/PA may require an RV-to-PA conduit.

Adults with repaired TOF often have hemody-
namic  sequelae  that  may  require  reintervention 
in  adulthood  (Table  269-4).  Pulmonary  regur-
gitation  is  common  following  TOF  repair  and 
is usually associated with RV dilation. Accurate 
quantification of RV size, function, and mass is 
particularly  important  in  adults  after  repair  of 
TOF,  as  RV  dilation,  dysfunction,  and  hyper-
trophy  are  associated  with  adverse  outcomes  in 
these  patients.  Patients  may  also  have  residual 
RVOT  obstruction,  which  may  occur  beneath 
the  pulmonary  valve,  at  the  valve  level,  above 
the  valve,  or  in  the  branch  PAs.  Cardiac  mag-
netic resonance imaging is routinely used in the 
surveillance  of  these  patients.  Left  ventricular 
dysfunction  is  present  in  at  least  20%  of  adults 
with repaired TOF, particularly those who were 
repaired later in life, had prior palliative shunts, 
or have concomitant RV dysfunction.

As patients age with repaired TOF, both atrial 
and ventricular arrhythmias occur with increas-
ing frequency. A QRS duration on a resting ECG 
of  180  ms  or  more  has  been  associated  with 
increased  risk  of  ventricular  tachycardia  and 
sudden death in this patient population. In one 
prospective follow-up study of 144 adults with repaired TOF, there was 
a 72% survival at 40 years, but only a 25% cumulative event-free sur-
vival.  These  events  include  need  for  reintervention  (most  commonly 
pulmonary valve replacement [PVR]), symptomatic arrhythmias, and 
heart failure.

to as inlet defects, are located in the crux of the heart and are associated 
with abnormalities of the AV valve leaflets. Subpulmonary defects, also 
known as conal septal defects, are commonly associated with prolapse 
of  the  right  coronary  cusp  and  aortic  insufficiency.  The  outcome  for 
adults  with  small  VSDs  without  evidence  of  ventricular  dilation  or 
pulmonary hypertension is generally excellent.

Patent  Ductus  Arteriosus  A  PDA  courses 
between the aortic isthmus and the origin of one 
of  the  branch  PAs.  Small  PDAs  are  often  silent 
to  auscultation  and  do  not  cause  hemodynamic 
changes.  The  classic  murmur  is  heard  best  just 
below the left clavicle and typically extends from 
systole past the second heart sound into diastole, 
reflecting  flow  turbulence  and  gradient  between 
the  aorta  and  the  PAs  (resulting  in  left-to-right 
shunting). Large PDAs will lead to left heart dila-
tion and may lead to chronically elevated pulmo-
nary  vascular  resistance,  including  the  potential 
for ES.

 ■ MODERATE AND COMPLEX CHD
Tetralogy of Fallot  Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is 
the most common form of cyanotic CHD, occurring 
in 0.5 per 1000 live births. It involves anterior devi-
ation of the conal septum, resulting in RV outflow 
tract (RVOT) obstruction, a VSD, RV hypertrophy, 
and an overriding aorta (Fig. 269-7A, B). There is a 
large spectrum of severity of disease in TOF, from 
patients who have only mild pulmonary stenosis to 
those with complete pulmonary atresia (TOF/PA). 
Current surgical strategies involve primary repair 
in  infancy  (Fig.  269-7C);  however,  many  adults 
may  have  first  undergone  palliative  procedures 
(Blalock-Taussig,  Potts,  Waterston  shunts)  prior 
to  a  complete  repair.  The  goal  of  surgical  repair 
is  to  alleviate  the  pulmonary  stenosis  and  close

redundant, fenestrated, and sail-like (typically seen in the anterior leaflet *) or adherent to the underlying 
myocardium with apical displacement of the nonadherent components (typically the septal and posterior 
leaflets). Location and degree of leaflet coaptation are variable and account for varying degrees of tricuspid 
regurgitation,  shift  of  the  functional  tricuspid  valve  anterior  from  the  anatomic  annulus  into  the  right 
ventricle, “atrialization” of the right ventricle, and most commonly angulation of the tricuspid valve into the 
RV outflow tract. RA and RV dilation (hashed lines) can occur due to the effects of combined volume from 
systemic venous return (“x”) and tricuspid regurgitant flow (“y”). PFO is frequent; worsening compliance and 
elevation of pressure in the RA as compared to the LA can lead to increasing “right-to-left” (deoxygenated 
to oxygenated) shunt and cyanosis. RV myocardial function may be abnormal. Ao, aorta; IVC, inferior vena

The  most  common  reintervention  in  a  repaired  TOF  patient  is 
a  PVR.  However,  optimal  timing  of  PVR  in  these  patients  remains 
unclear. Although PVR has been shown to decrease RV volumes and 
subjectively improve symptoms, it has not been proven to result in an 
improved ejection fraction or less adverse outcomes, such as ventric-
ular arrhythmias or death. Traditionally, PVR has been accomplished 
with  a  surgical  procedure;  however,  percutaneous  implantation  of 
pulmonary valves is becoming increasingly utilized in clinical practice.
Patients with repaired TOF may also undergo interventions includ-
ing closure of residual VSDs, dilation and/or stenting of the RVOT or 
branch PAs, and tricuspid valve repair. Patients with clinically signifi-
cant arrhythmias may benefit from catheter ablation.

Transposition of the Great Arteries  Transposition of the great 
arteries (TGA) is defined by the great arteries arising from the opposite 
side  of  the  ventricular  septum  than  normal;  as  such,  the  aorta  arises 
from the RV and the PA from the LV. The more common form of TGA, 
known  as  D-loop  TGA,  involves  AV  concordance  and  ventricular- 
arterial discordance, resulting in a physiology that allows two circuits 
to be in parallel rather than in series (Fig. 269-8A) and intense cyano-
sis shortly after birth. This physiology is not compatible with long-term 
survival without surgical intervention. Patients with TGA may be born 
with additional congenital defects (most commonly a VSD).

The surgical repairs for D-loop TGA have evolved over time. In the 
late  1950s  through  the  1970s,  the  atrial  switch  procedure  (Mustard,

FIGURE 269-7  A. Tetralogy of Fallot involves anterior and superior malalignment of a bar of tissue (conal septum) (see * in part B, which presents a cut-away view through 
the anterior surface of the RV, into the RV outflow), partially obstructing the right ventricular outflow (under the pulmonary valve, i.e., “subpulmonary stenosis”; labeled as 
1), and leaving a gap in the interventricular septum (VSD). The pulmonary valve annulus is typically hypoplastic. Outflow obstruction prevents regression of right ventricular 
hypertrophy  (#),  which  was  present  in  utero.  The  difference  in  pressure  and  outflow  resistance  in  systole  (and  the  difference  in  compliance  in  diastole)  between  the 
obstructed RV and the LV allows for a “shunt” of flow (“y”) of “blue” (deoxygenated) blood from the right side of the heart to the left side (oxygenated). Systemic venous 
return of pure deoxygenated blood (“x”) is decreased by the shunted blood (“y”), leading to a total decrease in the volume of blood (“x – y”) passing beyond into the lungs. 
The deoxygenated shunted blood (“y”) mixes with fully oxygenated blood in the LV, contributing to systemic arterial cyanosis. C. Tetralogy of Fallot—repaired. After modern 
repair of tetralogy of Fallot, VSD has been patched closed, and outflow tract obstruction has been surgically removed, frequently at the expense of a patch enlarging 
the  pulmonary  valve  annulus  at  the  expense  of  sacrificing  the  integrity  of  the  pulmonary  valve  (causing  pulmonary  regurgitation).  The  pulmonary  regurgitant  volume 
(“y”) is added to systemic venous return (“x”), contributing to RV chamber enlargement (hashed lines) and may be associated with tricuspid annular dilation and valve 
regurgitation, resulting in RA enlargement. Ao, aorta; IVC, inferior vena cava; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; PA, pulmonary arteries; PV, pulmonary veins; RA, right atrium;

Senning procedures) was performed (Fig. 269-8B). These atrial switch 
procedures relieved the cyanosis but left the patient with a systemic RV. 
Despite moderate-term survival over decades, there are multiple long-
term sequelae that may present following the atrial switch procedure. 
The  most  worrisome  complication  is  that  of  systemic  RV  dysfunc-
tion. The prevalence of RV dysfunction in this population is not well 
defined. Limited study has failed to reveal medical therapies effective 
for systemic RV dysfunction.

A  subset  of  patients  with  D-loop  TGA,  VSD,  and  PS  may  have 
undergone a Rastelli procedure. This intervention involves placing an 
RV-to-PA conduit and routing the LV to the aorta through the VSD, 
which results in relief of cyanosis and the benefit of a systemic LV.

In  the  1980s,  the  arterial  switch  operation  (ASO;  Fig.  269-8C) 
became the surgical procedure of choice for D-loop TGA. This proce-
dure involves transecting the great arteries above the sinuses and plac-
ing the PAs anteriorly to come into alignment with the RV, resulting in

draping of the branch PAs over the ascending aorta. A coronary artery 
translocation is performed. The ASO has resulted in substantial long-
term survival.

The potential long-term sequelae of the various surgical procedures 

for D-loop TGA are listed in Table 269-5.

The less common form of TGA, known as L-loop TGA (physiologi-
cally corrected or “congenitally corrected” TGA; Fig. 269-9), may not 
require surgical intervention but is presented here in relation to other 
forms of TGA. L-loop TGA involves both AV discordance (RA allow-
ing  passage  of  deoxygenated  systemic  venous  return  to  the  LV,  and 
conversely, the left atrium conducting oxygenated pulmonary venous 
blood to the RV) as well as ventriculoarterial discordance (connections 

of LV to PA, RV to aorta). This results in normal arterial oxygen satu-
ration, yet an RV associated with the aorta. Patients with L-loop TGA 
commonly have associated congenital anomalies, including dextrocar-
dia, ASDs, a dysplastic tricuspid valve, and pulmonary stenosis. Con-
duction disturbances are common, and complete heart block occurs in 
up to 30% of patients. Those patients without associated defects may 
not present until later in life, most commonly with heart failure, TR, or 
newly recognized conduction disease.

Coarctation  of  the  Aorta  Adults  with  coarctation  of  the  aorta 
(Fig. 269-10) typically have a shelf-like obstruction at the level of the 
descending aorta that passes just posterior to the junction of the main 
and left PA; obstruction less commonly involves the transverse aortic 
arch.  On  physical  examination,  the  lower  extremity  blood  pressure 
and pulses are lower than (and delayed in timing, in contrast to) the 
upper extremity values, unless significant aortic collaterals have devel-
oped. A continuous murmur over the scapula may be present due to 
the  collateral  blood  flow.  Significant  coarctation  increases  afterload 
to  all  proximal  structures  in  the  path  of  oxygenated  blood,  from  LV 
and  coronary  arteries,  to  ascending  and  transverse  aorta,  to  cerebral 
and arm vessels and proximal descending aorta. Bicuspid aortic valve 
(typically with right-left commissural fusion) is a common association. 
In women with short stature, webbed neck, lymphedema, and primary 
amenorrhea, a concomitant diagnosis of Turner syndrome should be 
considered,  the  presence  of  which  indicates  greater  degree  of,  and 
risks from, sequelae from seemingly similar anatomy and physiology. 
Patients  who  have  undergone  surgical  repair  in  general  have  a  good 
prognosis;  however,  they  remain  at  risk  for  systemic  hypertension, 
premature atherosclerosis, LV failure, and aortic aneurysm, dissection, 
and recurrent coarctation.

FIGURE 269-8  A. Transposition of the great arteries. When the great arteries are transposed, the aorta arises from the RV, and the pulmonary artery arises from the LV, 
leaving deoxygenated blood circulating from systemic veins to systemic arteries in separated fashion from oxygenated blood, which circulates from pulmonary veins to 
pulmonary arteries. Without interchamber or intravascular communications, this circulation is incompatible with life. Presence of an atrial septal defect (ASD), depicted 
here, ventricular septal defect (VSD), or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) allows for some interchamber or intravascular mixing and, at best, partial relief of cyanosis and 
sustenance of life, at the expense of increased pulmonary blood flow. B. Atrial switch. Atrial level switch procedures (Mustard and Senning) were the first standardized 
surgeries to alter the natural course of complex congenital heart disease, utilizing intracardiac rerouting via a “baffle” to redirect blood flow. The atrial switch simulates 
inverted trousers, with each “pants leg” (*) attaching to either the SVC or the IVC, transporting deoxygenated blood through the interior of the trousers to the “waist of 
the trousers” and directing blood through the mitral valve to the LV and out the PA. Surgical removal of the atrial septum allows pulmonary venous return to traverse from 
posterior left atrium through the space between the pants legs of the baffle, through the tricuspid valve to the RV (serving as the “systemic ventricle,” i.e., that pumps to 
the systemic arterial circulation), and out the aorta. Non-infrequent sequelae include sinus node dysfunction, atrial arrhythmias, systolic dysfunction of the RV, tricuspid 
regurgitation (from RV to LA), leaks in the baffle material allowing shunting of blood, and obstruction of the systemic or pulmonary venous baffles. C. Arterial switch. The 
arterial switch operation allowed both anatomic and physiologic correction for D-loop transposition of the great arteries. Successful surgical switching of the PA and the 
Ao above the level of the native roots (hashed lines) necessitated ability to transfer coronary artery origins contained within a button of tissue (*) back to the neo-aorta 
(now supported by the LV). Deoxygenated blood flow from SVC and IVC passes from RA to RV to PA, and oxygenated blood passes from PV to LA to LV to Ao. Uncommon 
sequelae include obstruction at any of the surgical sites (supravalvar PA or Ao stenosis, coronary orifice obstruction) or more distal obstructions due to tension placed on 
the PA, Ao, or coronary arteries. Ao, aorta; IVC, inferior vena cava; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; PA, pulmonary arteries; PV, pulmonary veins; RA, right atrium; RV, right

hypoplastic  left  heart  syndrome.  Most  patients  with  single  ventricle 
physiology undergo a series of surgeries culminating in a Fontan pro-
cedure (Fig. 269-11A, B). Since its initial use for tricuspid valve atresia 
in 1971, multiple modifications of this procedure have occurred, with 
common  features  of  near  complete  separation  of  the  pulmonary  and 
systemic circulations. The Fontan procedure utilizes the single ventri-
cle to pump pulmonary venous (oxygenated) blood through the aorta 
to  the  body  and  allows  for  “passive”  flow  of  systemic  venous  return 
of deoxygenated blood through surgically created connections to the 
lungs.  Patients  who  have  undergone  a  Fontan  procedure  are  at  risk 
for multiple comorbidities in adulthood, including atrial arrhythmias, 
heart failure, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and both venous and arte-
rial thrombosis and embolism.

FIGURE 269-9  Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Physiologically corrected transposition of the great arteries (also known as congenitally corrected 
transposition of the great arteries) is characterized by atrioventricular discordance and ventriculoarterial discordance. Systemic venous blood passes from the right atrium 
(RA) through the mitral valve into the morphologic left ventricle (LV) to the pulmonary artery (PA). Oxygenated blood then returns to the lungs to the left atrium (LA) through 
the tricuspid valve into the morphologic right ventricle (RV) and then out the aorta (Ao). IVC, inferior vena cava; PV, pulmonary veins; SVC, superior vena cava.

multiple-organ condition and may occur with any CHD with an initial 
left-to-right shunt. The natural history of ES is variable, and although 
there  is  significant  morbidity,  in  general,  adults  with  ES  appear  to 
survive  longer  than  those  with  other  forms  of  pulmonary  arterial 
hypertension.  Medical  care  recommendations  have  included  sustain-
ing  adequate  hydration,  avoiding  and  treating  anemia  including  iron 
supplementation when appropriate, and anticoagulation (although this 
remains controversial due to predisposition to bleeding and occurrence 
of  clinical  hemoptysis,  which  has  frequently  been  associated  with 
pulmonary  vascular  thrombosis).  Elevation  of  hematocrit  above  that

considered appropriate for the degree of cyanosis can be managed in 
symptomatic patients by hydration alone or, on occasion, by perform-
ing phlebotomy with isovolumic replenishment. Routine phlebotomy 
in  the  asymptomatic  adult  with  ES  is  contraindicated.  Appropriate 
optimization of iron stores has been demonstrated to improve quality 
of  life  and  functional  performance  in  iron-deficient  adults  with  ES. 
Contraception  for  women  with  ES  who  are  of  childbearing  age  is 
strongly recommended, avoiding use of estrogen, which may be throm-
bogenic. Pregnancy is contraindicated in these women due to the high 
risk of maternal mortality.

Recent evidence suggests that the use of selective pulmonary vaso-
dilators, such as bosentan or sildenafil, may be efficacious in ES. Select 
patients may be candidates for combined heart–lung transplantation or 
preferably lung transplantation with concomitant repair of the intrac-
ardiac defect, if feasible.

The  Role  of  Palliative  Care  in  ACHD 
In  aggregate,  adults 
with  CHD  demonstrate  both  quality-of-life–limiting  comorbidities 
and  premature  mortality  far  in  excess  of  age-matched  controls.  The 
reported prevalence of pain, anxiety, depression, dyspnea, and fatigue 
appears similar to that reported for adults who are decades older and 
engaged  in  palliative  care  for  acquired  cardiovascular  disease  at  end 
of life (EOL). Similarly, at EOL with ACHD, frequencies of hospital-
ization,  intensive  care  admission,  30-day  readmission,  and  increased 
length  of  hospital  stay  appear  greater  (despite  younger  age)  than  for 
adults  with  cancer.  In  a  retrospective  study  of  ACHD  patients  who 
died during a hospital admission, only a minority had engaged in EOL 
discussions with their providers. Surveys of both adults with CHD and 
their providers suggest that the overwhelming majority of patients wish 
to  participate  in  advanced  care  planning  and  discussion  of  palliative 
care; this contrasts with statements from ACHD care providers noting 
their uncertainties regarding EOL prognostication and concerns over 
discussion  about  EOL.  Palliative  care  specialists  who  are  embedded 
within or aligned with ACHD care teams can play an important and 
iterative role in defining and addressing alignment of patient and clini-
cian goals within the boundaries of frequently complex care decisions 
over the adult life span.

Global  Considerations  As  survival  patterns  improve  for  all 
medically complex patients, the internist and general practitioner are 
faced with particular challenges and dilemmas; foremost is accrual of

sufficient knowledge and competency so as to be able both to engage 
in patient care provision as well as to seek greater expertise, guidance, 
and support, when such is appropriate. Across the globe, lifelong care 
for adults with CHD typifies this growing demand. Care for adults with 
CHD within medical care centers that contain an ACHD specialty care 
program has been associated with improved overall survival. However, 
current  analyses  suggest  that  the  majority  of  adults  with  CHD  seek 
and  receive  their  medical  care  outside  of  such  ACHD  specialty  care 
centers  and  within  the  hands  of  the  general  practitioner,  internist, 
and  cardiologist.  Under  a  surface  of  adaptability  and  determination, 
adults with CHD present a wide spectrum of cognitive and functional 
performance,  multiple  organ  system  comorbidities,  abnormalities  of 
systemic  and  pulmonary  vasculature,  and  a  near  universal  presence 
of heart failure of one stage or another, all over a lifetime. It appears 
incumbent on the ACHD specialist and ACHD specialty care centers to 
serve as a hub for partnering practitioners, encouraging engagement to 
the level of highest competencies, and providing education, oversight, 
and support, so as to achieve optimal outcomes.

270 Pericardial Disease

Joseph Loscalzo

 ■ NORMAL FUNCTIONS OF THE PERICARDIUM
The normal pericardium is a double-layered sac of the visceral pericar-
dium  and  parietal  pericardium.  The  visceral  pericardium  is  a  serous 
membrane  that  is  separated  from  the  fibrous  parietal  pericardium 
by  a  small  quantity  (15–50  mL)  of  fluid,  an  ultrafiltrate  of  plasma. 
The  normal  pericardium,  by  exerting  a  restraining  force,  prevents 
sudden  dilation  of  the  cardiac  chambers,  especially  the  right  atrium 
and ventricle, e.g., during exercise. It also restricts the anatomic posi-
tion  of  the  heart  and  likely  retards  the  spread  of  infections  from  the 
lungs  and  pleural  cavities  to  the  heart.  Nevertheless,  total  absence  of 
the pericardium, either congenital or after surgery, does not produce 
obvious  clinical  disease.  In  partial  left  pericardial  defects,  the  main 
pulmonary artery and left atrium may bulge through the defect; very 
rarely, herniation and subsequent strangulation of the left atrium may 
cause sudden death.

ACUTE PERICARDITIS
Acute pericarditis, by far the most common pathologic process involv-
ing  the  pericardium  (Table  270-1),  has  four  principal  diagnostic 
features:

1.  Chest  pain  is  usually  present  in  acute  infectious  pericarditis  and 
in  many  of  the  forms  presumed  to  be  related  to  hypersensitivity,

autoimmunity, or of unknown cause (idiopathic). The pain of acute 
pericarditis is often severe, retrosternal and/or left precordial, and 
referred to the neck, arms, or left shoulder. Frequently the pain is 
pleuritic,  consequent  to  accompanying  pleural  inflammation  (i.e., 
sharp  and  aggravated  by  inspiration  and  coughing);  however,  at 
times, it is steady, radiates to the trapezius ridge or into either arm, 
and resembles that of myocardial ischemia. For this reason, confu-
sion  with  acute  myocardial  infarction  (AMI)  is  common.  Charac-
teristically, pericardial pain may be intensified by lying supine and 
relieved by sitting up and leaning forward (Chap. 14). Pain is often 
absent in slowly developing tuberculous, postirradiation, neoplastic, 
and uremic pericarditis.
  The differentiation of AMI from acute pericarditis may be chal-
lenging  when,  with  the  latter,  serum  biomarkers  of  myocardial 
damage such as troponin and creatine kinase-MB rise, presumably

because  of  concomitant  involvement  of  the  epicardium  in  the 
inflammatory process (an epi-myocarditis) with resulting myocyte 
necrosis. If they occur, however, these elevations are quite modest 
compared to those in AMI, given the extensive electrocardiographic 
ST-segment elevation in pericarditis. This dissociation is useful in 
differentiating between these conditions.

2.  A pericardial friction rub is audible at some point in the illness in 
about 85% of patients with acute pericarditis. The rub may have up 
to three components per cardiac cycle and is described as rasping, 
scratching, or grating (Chap. 239); it is heard most frequently at end 
expiration with the patient upright and leaning forward.

3.  The electrocardiogram (ECG) in acute pericarditis without massive 
effusion usually displays changes secondary to acute subepicardial 
inflammation  (Fig.  270-1A),  and  typically  evolves  through  four 
stages. In stage 1, there is widespread elevation of the ST segments, 
often with upward concavity, involving two or three standard limb 
leads  and  V2–V6,  with  reciprocal  depressions  only  in  aVR  and 
occasionally V1. In addition, there is depression of the PR segment 
below the TP segment, reflecting atrial involvement, an early change 
that may occur prior to ST segment elevation. Usually there are no 
significant  changes  in  QRS  complexes  unless  a  large  pericardial 
effusion develops (see below). After several days, the ST segments 
return  to  normal  (stage  2),  and  only  then,  or  even  later,  do  the  T 
waves become inverted (stage 3). Weeks or months after the onset 
of acute pericarditis, the ECG returns to normal (stage 4). In con-
trast,  in  AMI,  ST  elevations  are  upwardly  convex,  and  reciprocal 

depression  is  usually  more  prominent;  these  changes  may  return 
to normal within a day or two. Q waves may develop, with loss of 
R-wave  amplitude,  and  T-wave  inversions;  by  contrast,  with  acute 
pericarditis, these changes are usually seen within hours before the 
ST segments have become isoelectric (Chaps. 274 and 275).

4.  Pericardial effusion is usually associated with pain and/or the ECG 
changes mentioned above and, if the effusion is large, with electrical 
alternans (Fig. 270-1B). Pericardial effusion is especially important 
clinically when it develops within a relatively short time because it 
may  lead  to  cardiac  tamponade  (see  below).  Differentiation  from 
cardiac enlargement on physical examination may be difficult, but 
heart  sounds  may  be  fainter  with  large  pericardial  effusion.  The 
friction  rub  and  the  apex  impulse  may  disappear.  The  base  of  the 
left lung may be compressed by pericardial fluid, producing Ewart’s 
sign, a patch of dullness, increased fremitus, and egophany beneath 
the  angle  of  the  left  scapula.  The  chest  roentgenogram  may  show 
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, with a “water bottle” configu-
ration, but may be normal in patients with small effusions.

Diagnosis  Echocardiography  (Chap.  241)  is  the  most  widely  used 
imaging  technique.  It  is  sensitive,  specific,  simple,  and  noninvasive; 
may be performed at the bedside; and allows localization and estima-
tion  of  the  quantity  of  pericardial  fluid.  The  presence  of  pericardial 
fluid is recorded by two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography 
as a relatively echo-free space between the posterior pericardium and 
left ventricular epicardium and/or as a space between the anterior right

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemprednisone  1  mg/kg  per  day)  usually  suppress  the  clinical  mani-
festations of acute pericarditis in patients who have failed therapy 
with or do not tolerate NSAIDs and colchicine. However, since they 
increase the risk of subsequent recurrence, full-dose corticosteroids 
should be given for only 2–4 days and then tapered. Anticoagulants 
should be avoided because their use could cause bleeding into the 
pericardial cavity and tamponade.

In  patients  with  multiple,  frequent,  and  disabling  recurrences 
that continue for >2 years, are not prevented by continuing colchic-
ine and other NSAIDs, and are not controlled by glucocorticoids, 
treatment with azathioprine or anakinra (an interleukin 1β receptor 
antagonist)  has  been  reported  to  be  of  benefit.  Rarely,  pericardial 
stripping  may  be  necessary;  however,  this  procedure  may  not 
always terminate the recurrences.

The  majority  of  patients  with  acute  pericarditis  can  be  man-
aged as outpatients with careful follow-up. However, when specific 
causes (tuberculosis, neoplastic disease, bacterial infection) are sus-
pected, or if any of the predictors of poor prognosis (fever >38°C, 
subacute onset, or large pericardial effusion) are present, hospital-
ization is advisable.

 ■ CARDIAC TAMPONADE
The  accumulation  of  fluid  in  the  pericardial  space  in  a  quantity  suf-
ficient  to  cause  serious  obstruction  of  the  inflow  of  blood  into  the 
ventricles results in cardiac tamponade. This complication may be fatal 
if it is not recognized and treated promptly. The most common causes 
of tamponade are idiopathic pericarditis and pericarditis secondary to 
neoplastic disease, tuberculosis, or bleeding into the pericardial space 
after leakage from an aortic dissection, cardiac operation, trauma, or 
treatment with anticoagulants.

The three principal features of tamponade (Beck’s triad) are hypoten-
sion, soft or absent heart sounds, and jugular venous distention with 
a prominent x (early systolic) descent but an absent y (early diastolic) 
descent. The limitations to ventricular filling are responsible for reduc-
tions  of  cardiac  output  and  arterial  pressure.  The  quantity  of  fluid 
necessary to produce cardiac tamponade may be as small as 200 mL 
when the fluid develops rapidly or be as much as >2000 mL in slowly 
developing effusions when the pericardium has had the opportunity to 
stretch and adapt to an increasing volume.

A  high  index  of  suspicion  for  cardiac  tamponade  is  required 
because  in  many  instances  no  obvious  cause  for  pericardial  disease 
is  apparent.  This  diagnosis  should  be  considered  in  any  patient  with 
otherwise unexplained sudden enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, 
hypotension,  and  elevation  of  jugular  venous  pressure.  Reductions 
in  amplitude  of  the  QRS  complexes  and  electrical  alternans  of  the  P, 
QRS, or T waves should also raise the suspicion of cardiac tamponade  
(Fig. 270-1).

Table 270-2 lists the features that distinguish acute cardiac tampon-

ade from constrictive pericarditis.

ventricle and the parietal pericardium just beneath the anterior chest 
wall (Fig. 270-2).

The diagnosis of pericardial fluid or thickening may be confirmed 
by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
These  techniques  may  be  superior  to  echocardiography  in  detecting 
loculated pericardial effusions, and pericardial thickening, and in the 
identification  of  pericardial  masses.  MRI  is  also  helpful  in  detecting 
pericardial inflammation (Fig. 270-3).

TREATMENT
Acute Pericarditis

There  is  no  specific  therapy  for  acute  idiopathic  pericarditis,  but 
bed rest should be recommended, and anti-inflammatory treatment 
with  aspirin  (2–4  g/d)  or  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs),  such  as  ibuprofen  (600–800  mg  tid)  or  indomethacin 
(25–50  mg  tid),  should  be  administered  along  with  gastric  pro-
tection  (e.g.,  omeprazole  20  mg/d).  In  responsive  patients,  these 
doses  should  be  continued  for  1–2  weeks  and  then  tapered  over 
several  weeks.  In  addition,  colchicine  (0.5  mg  qd  [<70  kg]  or   
0.5 mg bid [>70 kg]) should be administered for 3 months. Colchi-
cine  enhances  the  response  to  NSAIDs  and  also  aids  in  reducing 
the risk of recurrent pericarditis. This drug is concentrated in and 
interferes  with  the  migration  of  neutrophils,  may  cause  diarrhea 
and  other  gastrointestinal  side  effects,  and  is  contraindicated  in 
patients  with  hepatic  or  renal  dysfunction.  Glucocorticoids  (e.g.,

Paradoxical Pulse  This important clue to the presence of cardiac 
tamponade consists of a greater than normal (10 mmHg) inspiratory 
decline in systolic arterial pressure. When severe, it may be detected by 
palpating weakness or even disappearance of the arterial pulse during 
inspiration, but usually sphygmomanometric measurement of systolic 
pressure during slow respiration is required.

Because both ventricles share a tight incompressible covering, i.e., 
the pericardial sac, the inspiratory enlargement of the right ventricle 
causes  leftward  bulging  of  the  interventricular  septum,  reducing  left 
ventricular volume, stroke volume, and arterial systolic pressure. Par-
adoxical pulse also occurs in approximately one-third of patients with 
constrictive pericarditis (see below), and in some cases of hypovolemic 
shock,  acute  and  chronic  obstructive  airway  disease,  and  pulmonary 
embolism.  Right  ventricular  infarction  (Chap.  275)  may  resemble 
cardiac tamponade with hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, 
an  absent  y  descent  in  the  jugular  venous  pulse,  and  occasionally,  a 
paradoxical pulse (Table 270-2).

Diagnosis  Because  immediate  treatment  of  cardiac  tamponade 
may  be  lifesaving,  prompt  establishment  of  the  diagnosis,  usually  by 
echocardiography,  should  be  undertaken.  When  pericardial  effusion 
causes  tamponade,  Doppler  ultrasound  shows  that  tricuspid  and 
pulmonic  valve  flow  velocities  increase  markedly  during  inspiration, 
whereas pulmonic vein, mitral, and aortic flow velocities decrease (as 
in  constrictive  pericarditis,  see  below)  (Fig.  270-4).  In  tamponade, 
there is late diastolic inward motion (collapse) of the right ventricular 
free  wall  and  the  right  atrium.  Transesophageal  echocardiography, 
CT, or cardiac MRI may be necessary to diagnose a loculated effusion 
responsible for cardiac tamponade.

TREATMENT
Cardiac Tamponade

Patients  with  acute  pericarditis  should  be  observed  frequently 
for  the  development  of  an  effusion.  If  a  large  effusion  is  present, 

pericardiocentesis  should  be  performed  or  the  patient  watched 
closely  for  signs  of  tamponade  with  serial  echocardiography  and 
monitoring of arterial and venous pressures. 
PERICARDIOCENTESIS
If manifestations of tamponade appear, pericardiocentesis using an 
apical, parasternal, or, most commonly, subxiphoid approach must 
be carried out at once because if left untreated, tamponade may be 
rapidly fatal. Whenever possible, this procedure should be carried 
out under echocardiographic guidance. Intravenous saline may be 
administered as the patient is being readied for the procedure, but 
the  pericardiocentesis  must  not  be  delayed.  If  possible,  intraperi-
cardial pressure should be measured before fluid is withdrawn, and

the pericardial cavity should be drained as completely as possible. 
A  small,  multiholed  catheter  may  be  advanced  over  the  needle 
inserted into the pericardial cavity and left in place to allow drain-
ing of the pericardial space if fluid reaccumulates. Surgical drainage 
through  a  limited  (subxiphoid)  thoracotomy  may  be  required  in 
recurrent tamponade to remove loculated effusions and/or when it 
is necessary to obtain tissue for diagnosis.

Pericardial fluid obtained from an effusion may have the physical 
characteristics  of  an  exudate.  In  developed  nations,  bloody  fluid 
is most commonly due to neoplasm, renal failure, or after cardiac 
injury. In developing nations, tuberculosis, may also cause exuda-
tive and/or bloody effusion.

The pericardial fluid should be analyzed for red and white blood 
cells and cytology for neoplastic cells. Cultures should be obtained. 
The  presence  of  DNA  of  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  determined 
by  the  polymerase  chain  reaction  strongly  supports  the  diagnosis 
of tuberculous pericarditis; however, it is often necessary to obtain 
pericardial tissue to make this diagnosis (Chap. 178).

 ■ VIRAL OR IDIOPATHIC ACUTE PERICARDITIS
In  many  instances,  acute  pericarditis  occurs  in  association  with  or 
following illnesses of known or presumed viral origin and probably is 
caused by the same agent. There may be an antecedent infection of the 
respiratory  tract,  but  viral  isolation  and  serologic  studies  are  usually 
negative. In some cases, Coxsackievirus A or B or the virus of influ-
enza, echovirus, mumps, Herpes simplex, varicella/zoster, adenovirus, 
or  cytomegalovirus  has  been  isolated  from  pericardial  fluid,  and/or 
appropriate  elevations  in  viral  antibody  titers  have  been  observed. 
Frequently, a viral cause cannot be established, and the term idiopathic 
acute pericarditis is appropriate.

Viral or idiopathic acute pericarditis occurs at all ages but is most 
common  in  young  adult  males  and  is  often  associated  with  pleural 
effusion  and  pneumonitis.  The  almost  simultaneous  development  of 
fever  and  precordial  pain,  often  10–12  days  after  a  presumed  viral 
illness, constitutes an important feature in the differentiation of acute 
pericarditis  from  AMI,  in  which  chest  pain  precedes  fever.  The  con-
stitutional symptoms are usually mild to moderate, and a pericardial 
friction rub is often audible. The disease ordinarily runs its course in a 
few days to 4 weeks. Elevations of C-reactive protein and of the white 
blood cell count are common. The ST-segment alterations in the ECG 
usually  disappear  after  1  or  more  weeks,  but  the  abnormal  T  waves 
may persist for as long as several years and be a source of confusion in 
persons without a clear history of pericarditis. Accumulation of some 
pericardial  fluid  is  common,  and  both  tamponade  and  constrictive 
pericarditis are possible, but infrequent, complications.

The  most  frequent  complication  is  recurrent  (relapsing)  pericar-
ditis,  which  occurs  in  about  one-fourth  of  patients  with  acute  idio-
pathic  pericarditis.  A  smaller  number  of  individuals  have  multiple 
recurrences.

Postcardiac Injury Syndrome  Acute pericarditis may appear in 
a  variety  of  circumstances  that  have  one  common  feature—previous 
injury  to  the  myocardium  with  blood  in  the  pericardial  cavity.  The 
syndrome may develop after a cardiac operation (postpericardiotomy 
syndrome), after blunt or penetrating cardiac trauma (Chap. 272), or 
after perforation of the heart with a catheter; rarely, it follows AMI.

The  clinical  picture  mimics  acute  viral  or  idiopathic  pericarditis. 
The principal symptom is the pain of acute pericarditis, which usually 
develops 1–4 weeks after the cardiac injury. Recurrences are common 
and may occur up to 2 years or more following the injury. Fever, pleuri-
tis, and pneumonitis are accompanying features, and the illness usually 
subsides in 1 or 2 weeks. The pericarditis may be of the fibrinous vari-
ety, or it may be a pericardial effusion, which is often serosanguinous 
and rarely causes tamponade. ECG changes typical of acute pericarditis 
may also occur. This syndrome is probably the result of a hypersensitiv-
ity (or autoimmune) reaction to antigen(s) that originate from injured 
myocardial tissue and/or pericardium.

Often  no  treatment  is  necessary  aside  from  aspirin  and  analge-
sics.  When  the  illness  is  severe  or  followed  by  a  series  of  disabling 

recurrences,  therapy  with  another  NSAID,  colchicine,  or  a  glucocor-
ticoid, such as described for treatment of acute pericarditis, is usually 
effective.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Because  there  is  no  specific  test  for  acute  idiopathic  pericarditis,  the 
diagnosis  is  one  of  exclusion.  Consequently,  all  other  disorders  that 
may be associated with acute fibrinous pericarditis must be considered. 
A common diagnostic error is mistaking acute viral or idiopathic peri-
carditis for AMI and vice versa.

Pericarditis  secondary  to  postcardiac  injury  is  differentiated  from 
acute idiopathic pericarditis chiefly by timing. If it occurs within a few 
days or weeks of a chest blow, a cardiac perforation, a cardiac opera-
tion, or an AMI, the two are probably related.

It  is  important  to  distinguish  pericarditis  due  to  collagen  vascular 
disease from acute idiopathic pericarditis. Most important in the differ-
ential diagnosis is the pericarditis due to systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE;  Chap.  356)  or  drug-induced  (hydralazine  or  procainamide) 
lupus. When pericarditis occurs in the absence of any obvious under-
lying disorder, the diagnosis of SLE may be suggested by a rise in the 
titer of antinuclear antibodies. Acute pericarditis is an occasional com-
plication of rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and polyarteritis nodosa, 
and other evidence of these diseases is usually obvious at the time of 
presentation with acute pericarditis.

Pyogenic  (purulent)  pericarditis  is  usually  secondary  to  cardiotho-
racic  operations,  by  extension  of  infection  from  the  lungs  or  pleural 
cavities, from rupture of the esophagus into the pericardial sac, or from 
rupture of a valvular ring abscess in a patient with infective endocardi-
tis. It may also complicate the viral, bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal 
infections that occur with HIV infection. It is generally accompanied 
by  fever,  chills,  septicemia,  and  evidence  of  infection  elsewhere,  and 
generally has a poor prognosis. The diagnosis is made by examination 
of the pericardial fluid. It requires immediate drainage as well as vigor-
ous antibiotic treatment.

Pericarditis  of  renal  failure  (uremic  pericarditis)  occurs  in  up  to 
one-third  of  patients  with  severe  renal  dysfunction  and  is  also  seen 
in  patients  undergoing  chronic  dialysis  who  have  normal  levels  of 
blood urea nitrogen (dialysis-associated pericarditis). These two forms 
of  pericarditis  may  be  fibrinous  and  are  generally  associated  with 
serosanguinous  effusions;  frank  hemorrhagic  effusions  may  be  seen 
in  some  cases  of  uremic  pericarditis  prior  to  the  onset  of  dialysis.  A 
pericardial friction rub is common, but pain is usually absent or mild. 
Treatment  with  an  NSAID  and  intensification  of  dialysis  are  usually 
adequate.  Occasionally,  tamponade  occurs  and  pericardiocentesis  is 
required. When the pericarditis of renal failure is recurrent or persis-
tent, a pericardial window should be created or pericardiectomy may 
be necessary.

Pericarditis  due  to  neoplastic  diseases  results  from  extension  or 
invasion  of  metastatic  tumors  (most  commonly  carcinoma  of  the 
lung  and  breast,  malignant  melanoma,  lymphoma,  and  leukemia) 
to  the  pericardium.  The  pain  of  pericarditis,  tamponade,  and  atrial 
arrhythmias  are  complications  that  occur  occasionally.  Diagnosis  is 
made  by  pericardial  fluid  cytology  or  pericardial  biopsy.  Mediastinal 
irradiation for neoplasm may cause acute pericarditis and/or chronic 
constrictive  pericarditis.  Unusual  causes  of  acute  pericarditis  include 
syphilis, fungal infection (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, 
and  candidiasis),  and  parasitic  infestation  (amebiasis,  toxoplasmosis, 
echinococcosis, and trichinosis) (Table 270-1).

 ■ CHRONIC PERICARDIAL EFFUSIONS
Chronic  pericardial  effusions  are  sometimes  encountered  in  patients 
without  an  antecedent  history  of  acute  pericarditis.  They  may  cause 
few symptoms per se, and their presence may be detected by finding 
an enlarged cardiac silhouette on a chest roentgenogram. Tuberculosis 
and myxedema may be causal. Neoplasms, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, 
mycotic  infections,  radiation  therapy  to  the  chest,  and  chylopericar-
dium may also cause chronic pericardial effusion and should be con-
sidered and specifically sought in such patients. Aspiration and analysis 
of the pericardial fluid are often helpful in diagnosis. Pericardial fluid

2024 should  be  analyzed  as  described  under  pericardiocentesis.  Grossly 
sanguineous pericardial fluid results most commonly from a neoplasm, 
tuberculosis,  renal  failure,  or  slow  leakage  from  an  aortic  dissection. 
Pericardiocentesis  may  resolve  large  effusions,  but  pericardiectomy 
may  be  required  in  patients  with  recurrence.  Intrapericardial  instil-
lation of sclerosing agents may be used to prevent reaccumulation of 
fluid, most commonly in recurrent neoplastic effusions.

CHRONIC CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS
This disorder results when the healing of an acute fibrinous or serofi-
brinous pericarditis or the resorption of a chronic pericardial effusion 
is followed by obliteration of the pericardial cavity with the formation 
of granulation tissue. The latter gradually contracts and forms a firm 
scar  encasing  the  heart,  which  may  become  calcified.  In  developing 
nations, a high percentage of cases are of tuberculous origin, but this 
is  now  an  uncommon  cause  in  North  America  or  Western  Europe. 
Chronic constrictive pericarditis may follow acute or relapsing viral or 
idiopathic  pericarditis,  trauma  with  organized  blood  clot,  or  cardiac 
surgery of any type, or results from mediastinal irradiation, purulent 
infection, histoplasmosis, neoplastic disease (especially breast cancer, 
lung  cancer,  and  lymphoma),  rheumatoid  arthritis,  SLE,  or  chronic 
renal  failure  treated  by  chronic  dialysis.  In  many  patients,  the  cause 
of  the  pericardial  disease  is  undetermined,  and  in  these  patients,  an 
asymptomatic  or  forgotten  bout  of  viral  pericarditis,  idiopathic  or 
acute, may have been the inciting event.

The  basic  physiologic  abnormality  in  patients  with  chronic  con-
strictive  pericarditis  is  the  inability  of  the  ventricles  to  fill  owing  to 
the limitations imposed by the rigid, thickened pericardium. Ventric-
ular filling is unimpeded during early diastole but is reduced abruptly 
when the elastic limit of the pericardium is reached, whereas in cardiac 
tamponade, ventricular filling is impeded throughout diastole. In both 
conditions,  ventricular  end-diastolic  and  stroke  volumes  are  reduced 
and the end-diastolic pressures in both ventricles and the mean pres-
sures in the atria, pulmonary veins, and systemic veins are all elevated 
to  similar  levels  (i.e.,  within  5  mmHg  of  one  another).  Despite  these 
hemodynamic  changes,  systolic  function  may  be  normal  or  only 
slightly impaired at rest. However, in advanced cases, the fibrotic pro-
cess may extend into the myocardium and cause myocardial scarring 
and atrophy, and venous congestion may then be due to the combined 
effects of the pericardial and myocardial lesions.

In constrictive pericarditis, the right and left atrial pressure pulses 
display an M-shaped contour, with prominent x and  y descents. The 
y descent, which is absent or diminished in cardiac tamponade, is the 
most prominent deflection in constrictive pericarditis; it reflects rapid 
early filling of the ventricles. The y descent is interrupted by a rapid 
rise in atrial pressure during early diastole, when ventricular filling is 
impeded by the constricting pericardium. These characteristic changes 
are transmitted to the jugular veins, where they may be recognized by 
inspection. In constrictive pericarditis, the ventricular pressure pulses 
in  both  ventricles  exhibit  characteristic  “square  root”  signs  during 
diastole. These hemodynamic changes, although characteristic, are not 
pathognomonic of constrictive pericarditis and may also be observed 
in restrictive cardiomyopathies (Chap. 259, Table 259-2).

 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FINDINGS
Weakness, fatigue, weight gain, increased abdominal girth, abdominal 
discomfort, and edema are common. The patient often appears chron-
ically ill, and in advanced cases, anasarca, skeletal muscle wasting, and 
cachexia may be present. Exertional dyspnea is common, and orthop-
nea  may  occur,  although  it  is  usually  not  severe.  The  neck  veins  are 
distended and may remain so even after intensive diuretic treatment, 
and venous pressure may fail to decline during inspiration (Kussmaul’s 
sign). The latter is common in chronic pericarditis but may also occur 
in  tricuspid  stenosis,  right  ventricular  infarction,  and  restrictive 
cardiomyopathy.

The pulse pressure is normal or reduced. A paradoxical pulse can 
be  detected  in  about  one-third  of  cases.  Congestive  hepatomegaly  is 
pronounced,  may  impair  hepatic  function,  and  may  cause  jaundice; 

ascites  is  common  and  is  usually  more  prominent  than  dependent 
edema. Pleural effusions and splenomegaly may also be present. The 
apical  pulse  is  reduced  and  may  retract  in  systole  (Broadbent’s  sign). 
The heart sounds may be distant; an early third heart sound (i.e., a peri-
cardial knock) occurring at the cardiac apex with the abrupt cessation 
of ventricular filling is often conspicuous.

The  ECG  frequently  displays  low  voltage  of  the  QRS  complexes 
and diffuse flattening or inversion of the T waves. Atrial fibrillation is 
present in about one-third of patients. The chest roentgenogram shows 
a  normal  or  slightly  enlarged  heart.  Pericardial  calcification  is  most 
common  in  tuberculous  pericarditis.  Pericardial  calcification  may, 
however,  occur  in  the  absence  of  constriction,  and  constriction  may 
occur without calcification.

Inasmuch  as  the  common  physical  signs  of  cardiac  disease  (mur-
murs, cardiac enlargement) may be inconspicuous or absent in chronic 
constrictive pericarditis, hepatic enlargement and dysfunction associ-
ated with jaundice and intractable ascites may lead to a mistaken diag-
nosis of hepatic cirrhosis. This error can be avoided if the neck veins 
are inspected and found to be distended.

The transthoracic echocardiogram often shows pericardial thicken-
ing, dilation of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, and a sharp 
halt  to  rapid  left  ventricular  filling  in  early  diastole,  with  normal 
ventricular systolic function and flattening of the left ventricular pos-
terior wall. There is a distinctive pattern of transvalvular flow velocity 
on  Doppler  echocardiography  (Fig.  270-4).  During  inspiration,  there 
is  an  exaggerated  reduction  in  blood  flow  velocity  in  the  pulmonary 
veins and across the mitral valve, and a leftward shift of the ventric-
ular  septum;  the  opposite  occurs  during  expiration.  Diastolic  flow 
velocity in the inferior vena cava into the right atrium and across the 
tricuspid valve increases in an exaggerated manner during inspiration 
and  declines  during  expiration.  However,  echocardiography  cannot 
definitively establish or exclude the diagnosis of constrictive pericardi-
tis; CT and MRI are more accurate, with the latter useful in evaluating 
myocardial involvement.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As with chronic constrictive pericarditis, cor pulmonale (Chap. 257) 
may  be  associated  with  marked  systemic  venous  hypertension,  little 
pulmonary  congestion,  a  (left)  heart  that  is  not  enlarged,  and  a  par-
adoxical  pulse.  However,  in  cor  pulmonale,  advanced  parenchymal 
pulmonary disease is usually apparent and venous pressure falls dur-
ing  inspiration  (i.e.,  Kussmaul’s  sign  is  negative).  Tricuspid  stenosis 
(Chap.  266)  may  also  simulate  chronic  constrictive  pericarditis  with 
congestive hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, and venous distention. 
However, the characteristic murmur and that of accompanying mitral 
stenosis are usually present.

Because  it  can  be  corrected  surgically,  it  is  important  to  distin-
guish chronic constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy 
(Chap. 259), which has a similar pathophysiologic underpinning (i.e., 
restriction of ventricular filling). The differentiating features are sum-
marized in Table 270-2. When a patient has progressive, disabling, and 
unresponsive congestive heart failure and displays any of the features of 
constrictive heart disease, Doppler echocardiography to record respira-
tory effects on transvalvular flow (Fig. 270-4) should be performed and 
an MRI or CT scan should be obtained to detect or exclude constrictive 
pericarditis because the latter is usually correctable.

TREATMENT
Constrictive Pericarditis

Pericardial  resection  is  the  only  definitive  treatment  of  constric-
tive  pericarditis  and  should  be  as  complete  as  possible.  Coronary 
arteriography should be carried out preoperatively in patients aged 
>50  years  to  exclude  unsuspected  accompanying  coronary  artery 
disease. The benefits derived from cardiac decortication are usually 
progressive  over  a  period  of  months.  The  risk  of  this  operation 
depends  on  the  extent  of  penetration  of  the  myocardium  by  the 

HPIM21e_Part6_p1797-p2130.indd   2024

21/01/22   6:24 PM

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemfibrotic and calcific process, the severity of myocardial atrophy, the 
extent of secondary impairment of hepatic and/or renal function, 
and  the  patient’s  general  condition.  Operative  mortality  is  in  the 
range  of  5–10%  even  in  experienced  centers;  the  patients  with   
the most severe disease, especially secondary to radiation therapy, 
are at highest risk. Therefore, surgical treatment should, if possible, 
be carried out as early as possible.

Subacute  Effusive-Constrictive  Pericarditis  This  form  of 
pericardial  disease  is  characterized  by  the  combination  of  a  tense 
effusion in the pericardial space and constriction of the heart by thick-
ened  pericardium.  As  such,  it  shares  a  number  of  features  with  both 
chronic pericardial effusion producing cardiac compression and with 
pericardial constriction. It may be caused by tuberculosis (see below), 
multiple  attacks  of  acute  idiopathic  pericarditis,  radiation,  traumatic 
pericarditis,  renal  failure,  scleroderma,  and  neoplasms.  The  heart  is 
generally  enlarged,  and  a  paradoxical  pulse  is  usually  present.  After 
pericardiocentesis,  the  physiologic  findings  may  change  from  those 
of  cardiac  tamponade  to  those  of  pericardial  constriction.  Further-
more,  the  intrapericardial  pressure  and  the  central  venous  pressure 
may  decline,  but  not  to  normal.  The  diagnosis  can  be  established 
by  pericardiocentesis  followed  by  pericardial  biopsy.  Wide  excision 
of  both  the  visceral  and  parietal  pericardium  is  usually  effective  
therapy.

Tuberculous  Pericardial  Disease  This  chronic  infection  is  a 
common  cause  of  chronic  pericardial  effusion,  especially  in  the 
developing  world  where  active  tuberculosis  and  HIV  are  endemic. 
Tuberculous  pericarditis  may  present  as  pericardial  effusion,  chronic 
constrictive  pericarditis,  or  subacute  effusive-constrictive  pericarditis 
(see  above).  The  clinical  picture  is  that  of  a  chronic,  systemic  illness 
in a patient with pericardial effusion. It is important to consider this 
diagnosis  in  a  patient  with  known  tuberculosis,  with  HIV,  and  with 
fever, chest pain, weight loss, and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette 
of undetermined origin. If the etiology of chronic pericardial effusion 
remains obscure despite detailed analysis including culture of the peri-
cardial fluid, a pericardial biopsy, preferably by a limited thoracotomy, 
should be performed. If definitive evidence is still lacking but the spec-
imen shows granulomas with caseation, antituberculous chemotherapy 
(Chap. 178) is indicated.

If  the  biopsy  specimen  shows  a  thickened  pericardium  after  
2–4 weeks of antituberculous therapy, pericardiectomy should be per-
formed to prevent the development of constriction. Tubercular cardiac 
constriction should be treated surgically while the patient is receiving 
antituberculous chemotherapy.

271 Atrial Myxoma and Other 
Cardiac Tumors
Eric H. Awtry

Cardiac tumors can be broadly classified into those that arise primarily 
in  the  heart  and  those  that  reflect  metastatic  disease  from  a  distant 
primary  source.  Primary  cardiac  tumors  can  be  further  divided  into 
those  that  are  pathologically  benign  and  those  that  are  malignant. 
Overall,  primary  cardiac  tumors  are  relatively  uncommon,  whereas 
secondary involvement of the heart or pericardium occurs in as many 
as  20%  of  patients  with  end-stage  metastatic  cancer.  While  patients 
with  cardiac  tumors  may  present  with  a  variety  of  symptoms,  many 
patients  are  asymptomatic  at  the  time  of  diagnosis,  the  tumor  being 
identified incidentally on imaging studies performed for other reasons. 
Cardiac  tumors  need  to  be  differentiated  from  other  cardiac  masses 
such  as  vegetation,  thrombus,  inflammatory  myofibroblastic  tumors, 
or  myocardial  hypertrophy.  Echocardiography  is  usually  the  initial 
imaging modality used to evaluate cardiac tumors; however, a variety 
of imaging modalities are now available, and a multimodality approach 
is often necessary for accurate diagnosis and clarification of treatment 
options (Table 271-1).
 ■ PRIMARY TUMORS
Primary tumors of the heart are rare, occurring in ~1 in 2000 patients 
in  autopsy  series.  Approximately  three-quarters  are  histologically 
benign, the majority of which are myxomas. Malignant tumors, almost 
all of which are sarcomas, account for 25% of primary cardiac tumors. 
All cardiac tumors, regardless of pathologic type, have the potential to 
cause life-threatening complications. Many tumors are now surgically 
curable; thus, early diagnosis is imperative.

Clinical  Presentation  Cardiac  tumors  may  present  with  a  wide 
array of cardiac and noncardiac manifestations. These manifestations, 
which depend in large part on the location and size of the tumor as well 
as its impact on surrounding cardiac structures, are often nonspecific 
features  of  more  common  forms  of  heart  disease,  and  include  chest

of tumor size, and identification of local 
invasion when compared with TTE or TEE. May 
differentiate tumor from thrombus.
Provides anatomic assessment and tissue 
characterization of the tumor. Useful when 
patients cannot tolerate MRI or when MRI is not 
feasible (e.g., patients with implantable cardiac 
devices). Allows for better assessment of calcified 
lesions and evaluation of extracardiac tumor 
involvement.
Definition of extracardiac disease. May be 
useful in diagnosis of certain cardiac tumors 
(e.g., neuroendocrine tumors), but assessment 
of smaller tumors may be limited by surrounding 
myocardial FDG uptake.

2026 pain,  syncope,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF),  murmurs, 
arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, pericardial effusion, 
and pericardial tamponade. Additionally, embolic phenom-
ena and constitutional symptoms may occur.

Myxoma  Myxomas  are  the  most  common  type  of  pri-
mary  cardiac  tumor  in  adults,  accounting  for  one-third 
to  one-half  of  all  cases  at  postmortem  examination,  and 
approximately  three-quarters  of  the  tumors  treated  surgi-
cally.  They  occur  at  all  ages,  most  commonly  in  the  third 
through sixth decades, with a female predilection. Approx-
imately  90%  of  myxomas  are  sporadic;  the  remainder 
are  familial  with  autosomal  dominant  transmission.  The 
familial variety often occurs as part of a syndrome complex 
(Carney  complex)  that  includes  (1)  myxomas  (cardiac, 
skin, and/or breast), (2) lentigines and/or pigmented nevi, 
and  (3)  endocrine  overactivity  (primary  nodular  adrenal 
cortical disease with or without Cushing’s syndrome, testic-
ular tumors, and/or pituitary adenomas with gigantism or 
acromegaly).  Certain  constellations  of  findings  have  been 
referred  to  as  the  NAME  syndrome  (nevi,  atrial  myxoma, 
myxoid  neurofibroma,  and  ephelides)  or  the  LAMB  syn-
drome (lentigines, atrial myxoma, and blue nevi), although 
these syndromes probably represent subsets of the Carney 
complex.  The  genetic  basis  of  this  complex  has  not  been  elucidated 
completely;  however,  inactivating  mutations  in  the  tumor-suppressor 
gene PRKAR1A, which encodes the protein kinase A type I-α regulatory 
subunit, have been identified in ~70% of patients with Carney complex.
Pathologically,  myxomas  are  gelatinous  structures  that  consist  of 
myxoma  cells  embedded  in  a  stroma  rich  in  glycosaminoglycans. 
Most  sporadic  tumors  are  solitary,  arise  from  the  interatrial  septum 
in the vicinity of the fossa ovalis (particularly in the left atrium), and 
are  often  pedunculated  on  a  fibrovascular  stalk.  In  contrast,  familial 
or syndromic tumors tend to occur in younger individuals, are often 
multiple, may be ventricular in location, and are more likely to recur 
after initial resection.

A

Myxomas commonly present with obstructive signs and symptoms. 
The  most  common  clinical  presentation  mimics  that  of  mitral  valve 
disease: either stenosis owing to tumor prolapse into the mitral orifice 
or  regurgitation  resulting  from  tumor-induced  valvular  trauma  or 
distortion. Ventricular myxomas may cause outflow tract obstruction 
similar  to  that  caused  by  subaortic  or  subpulmonic  stenosis.  The 
symptoms and signs of myxoma may be sudden in onset or positional 
in  nature,  owing  to  the  effects  of  gravity  on  tumor  position.  A  char-
acteristic  low-pitched  sound,  a  “tumor  plop,”  may  be  appreciated  on 
auscultation during early or mid-diastole and is thought to result from 
the  impact  of  the  tumor  against  the  mitral  valve  or  ventricular  wall. 
Myxomas  also  may  present  with  peripheral  or  pulmonary  embolic 
phenomenon  (resulting  from  embolization  of  tumor  fragments  or 
tumor-associated  thrombus)  or  with  constitutional  signs  and  symp-
toms, including fever, weight loss, cachexia, malaise, arthralgias, rash, 
digital  clubbing,  and  Raynaud’s  phenomenon.  These  constitutional 
symptoms are likely the result of cytokines (e.g., interleukin 6) secreted 
by the myxoma. Laboratory abnormalities, such as hypergammaglob-
ulinemia,  anemia,  polycythemia,  leukocytosis,  thrombocytopenia  or 
thrombocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated 
C-reactive  protein  level  are  often  present.  These  features  account  for 
the frequent misdiagnosis of patients with myxomas as having endo-
carditis, collagen vascular disease, or a paraneoplastic syndrome.

Two-dimensional  and  three-dimensional  transthoracic  and/or 
transesophageal  echocardiography  are  useful  in  the  diagnosis  of 
cardiac myxoma and allow for assessment of tumor size and determi-
nation  of  the  site  of  tumor  attachment,  both  of  which  are  important 
considerations in the planning of surgical excision (Fig. 271-1). Com-
puted tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may 
provide important additional information regarding size, shape, com-
position, and surface characteristics of the tumor (Fig. 271-2) and may 
identify  extracardiac  intrathoracic  involvement  in  patients  in  whom 
metastatic disease is suspected.

Although cardiac catheterization and angiography were previously 
performed routinely before tumor resection, they no longer are con-
sidered  mandatory  when  adequate  noninvasive  information  is  avail-
able and other cardiac disorders (e.g., coronary artery disease) are not 
considered  likely.  Additionally,  catheterization  of  the  chamber  from 
which the tumor arises carries the risk of tumor embolization. Because 
myxomas may be familial, echocardiographic screening of first-degree 
relatives  is  appropriate,  particularly  if  the  patient  is  young  and  has 
multiple tumors or features of a myxoma syndrome.

TREATMENT
Myxoma

Surgical  excision  using  cardiopulmonary  bypass  is  indicated 
regardless of tumor size and is generally curative. Myxomas recur in 
12–22% of familial cases but in only 1–2% of sporadic cases. Tumor

setting and incomplete tumor resection in the latter.

Other Benign Tumors  Cardiac lipomas, although relatively com-
mon, are usually incidental findings at postmortem examination; how-
ever, they may grow as large as 15 cm, may present as an abnormality of 
the cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray, and should be resected if they pro-
duce  symptoms  owing  to  mechanical  interference  with  cardiac  func-
tion, arrhythmias, or conduction disturbances. Papillary fibroelastomas 
are friable tumors with frond-like projections that are usually solitary 
and  are  the  most  common  tumors  of  the  cardiac  valves.  Remnants 
of  cytomegalovirus  have  been  recovered  from  these  tumors,  raising 
the possibility that they arise as a result of chronic viral endocarditis. 
Although usually clinically silent, they can cause valve dysfunction and 
may  embolize  distally,  resulting  in  transient  ischemic  attacks,  stroke, 
or myocardial infarction. In general, these tumors should be resected 
even when asymptomatic, although a more conservative approach may 
be considered for small, right-sided lesions. Rhabdomyomas and fibro-
mas are the most common cardiac tumors in infants and children and 
usually  occur  in  the  ventricles,  where  they  may  produce  mechanical 
obstruction to blood flow, thereby mimicking valvular stenosis, CHF, 
restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or pericardial constriction. 
Rhabdomyomas are probably hamartomatous growths, are multiple in 
90% of cases, occur in ~50% of children with tuberous sclerosis, and 
are associated with mutations in the tumor-suppressor genes TSC1 and 
TSC2 (Fig. 271-3). These tumors have a tendency to regress completely 
or partially; only tumors that cause obstruction require surgical resec-
tion.  Fibromas  are  usually  single,  universally  ventricular  in  location, 
often  calcified,  and  may  be  associated  with  mutations  in  the  tumor-
suppressor  gene  PTCH1.  Fibromas  tend  to  grow  and  cause  arrhyth-
mias  and  obstructive  symptoms  and  should  be  completely  resected 
when  possible.  Paragangliomas  are  rare  chromaffin  cell  tumors  that 
represent extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Most are located in the 
roof of the left atrium and can be identified on cardiac CT or MRI or 
with  nuclear  scanning  using  131-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine.  They 
are highly vascular and may be hormonally active, resulting in uncon-
trolled  hypertension.  Extensive  surgical  resection  is  usually  required. 
Hemangiomas  and  mesotheliomas  are  generally  small  tumors,  most 
often intramyocardial in location, and may cause atrioventricular (AV) 
conduction disturbances and even sudden death as a result of their pro-
pensity to develop in the region of the AV node. Other benign tumors 
arising from the heart include teratoma, chemodectoma, neurilemoma, 
granular cell myoblastoma, and paraganglioma.

Malignant Tumors  Almost all malignant primary cardiac tumors 
are sarcomas, which may be of several histologic types; angiosarcomas

are  the  most  common  type  in  adults,  whereas  rhabdomyosarcomas 
are the most common type in children. In general, sarcomas are char-
acterized  by  rapid  progression  that  culminates  in  the  patient’s  death 
within  weeks  to  months  from  the  time  of  presentation  as  a  result  of 
hemodynamic  compromise,  local  invasion,  or  distant  metastases. 
Almost one-third are metastatic at the time of initial diagnosis, usually 
involving the lungs. Sarcomas commonly involve the right side of the 
heart, are rapidly growing, frequently invade the pericardial space, and 
may obstruct the cardiac chambers or venae cavae. Sarcomas also may 
occur on the left side of the heart and may be mistaken for myxomas. 
Isolated  cardiac  lymphomas  have  been  rarely  described,  but  more 
commonly  occur  in  the  context  of  systemic  disease.  They  are  more 
common in men and in the elderly; usually involve the right heart; may 
represent  with  arrhythmias,  syncope,  CHF,  or  constitutional  symp-
toms; and are usually of the large B-cell type.

TREATMENT
Malignant Tumors

The  optimal  therapy  for  cardiac  sarcoma  is  complete  resection, 
often with neoadjuvant and postoperative chemotherapy; however, 
at the time of presentation, many of these tumors have spread too 
extensively to allow for surgical excision. Although there are scat-
tered reports of palliation with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, 
the  response  of  cardiac  sarcomas  to  these  therapies  is  generally 
poor.  The  one  exception  appears  to  be  cardiac  lymphosarcomas, 
which may respond to a combination of chemo- and radiotherapy. 
Primary  cardiac  lymphoma  is  the  most  chemotherapy-sensitive 
primary  cardiac  malignancy,  with  long-term  survival  achieved  in 
~40% of treated individuals.

 ■ TUMORS METASTATIC TO THE HEART
Metastatic  cardiac  tumors  are  much  more  common  than  primary 
cardiac  tumors,  and  their  incidence  is  likely  to  increase  as  the  life 
expectancy of patients with various forms of malignant neoplasms is 
extended by more effective therapy and improved imaging modalities 
allow  earlier  identification  of  metastatic  disease.  Although  cardiac 
metastases  may  occur  with  any  tumor  type,  the  relative  incidence  is 
especially  high  in  malignant  melanoma  and,  to  a  somewhat  lesser 
extent,  leukemia  and  lymphoma  (Fig.  271-4).  In  absolute  terms,  the 
most common primary sites from which cardiac metastases originate 
are carcinoma of the breast and lung, reflecting the high incidence of 
these malignancies. Cardiac metastases almost always occur in the set-
ting of widespread primary disease; most often, there is either primary 
or metastatic disease elsewhere in the thoracic cavity.

Cardiac  metastases  may  occur  via  hematogenous  or  lymphangitic 
spread or by direct tumor invasion. While they generally manifest as 
small, firm nodules, diffuse infiltration also may occur, especially with 
sarcomas  or  hematologic  neoplasms.  The  pericardium  is  most  often 
involved,  followed  by  myocardial  involvement  of  any  chamber  and, 
rarely, by involvement of the endocardium or cardiac valves.

Cardiac  metastases  are  clinically  apparent  only  ~10%  of  the  time, 
are usually not the cause of the patient’s presentation, and rarely are the 
cause of death. The vast majority occur in the setting of a previously 
recognized malignant neoplasm. As with primary cardiac tumors, the 
clinical presentation reflects more the location and size of the tumor 
than  its  histologic  type.  When  symptomatic,  cardiac  metastases  may 
result in a variety of clinical features, including dyspnea, acute pericar-
ditis,  cardiac  tamponade,  ectopic  tachyarrhythmias,  heart  block,  and 
CHF. Importantly, many of these signs and symptoms may also result 
from  myocarditis,  pericarditis,  or  cardiomyopathy  induced  by  radio-
therapy  or  chemotherapy,  and  a  high  index  of  suspicion  for  cardiac 
involvement should be maintained for patients with malignant disease 
who develop these symptoms.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) findings are nonspecific but may reveal 
features consistent with pericarditis or may demonstrate low QRS volt-
age and electrical alternans in the setting of a large pericardial effusion. 
On chest x-ray, the cardiac silhouette is most often normal but may be 
enlarged  or  exhibit  a  bizarre  contour.  Echocardiography  is  useful  for 
identifying and assessing the significance of pericardial effusions and 
visualizing  larger  metastases,  although  CT  and  radionuclide  imaging 
may define the tumor burden more clearly. Cardiac MRI offers superb 
image quality and plays a central role in the diagnostic evaluation of 
cardiac  metastases  and  cardiac  tumors  in  general.  Pericardiocentesis 
may allow for a specific cytologic diagnosis in patients with malignant 
pericardial effusions with a reported sensitivity of 67–92%. Angiogra-
phy is rarely necessary but may help to delineate discrete myocardial 
lesions.

TREATMENT
Tumors Metastatic to the Heart

Most  patients  with  cardiac  metastases  have  advanced  malignant 
disease; thus, therapy is generally palliative and consists of control-
ling symptoms and treatment of the primary tumor. Symptomatic 
malignant  pericardial  effusions  should  be  drained  by  pericardio-
centesis.  Prolonged  drainage  (3–5  days)  and  concomitant  instil-
lation  of  a  sclerosing  agent  (e.g.,  tetracycline  or  bleomycin)  may 
delay or prevent reaccumulation of the effusion, and creation of a 
pericardial window allows drainage of the effusion to the adjacent 
pleural  or  peritoneal  space.  Given  the  overall  poor  prognosis  of 
these patients, discussions regarding goals of care and involvement 
of palliative care services are often appropriate.

272 Cardiac Trauma

Eric H. Awtry

 ■ CARDIAC TRAUMA
Traumatic cardiac injury may be caused by either penetrating or non-
penetrating trauma; the latter is often referred to as blunt cardiac injury 
(BCI).  Penetrating  injuries  most  often  result  from  gunshot  or  knife 
wounds, and the site of entry is usually obvious. Blunt cardiac injuries 
most  often  occur  during  motor  vehicle  accidents,  either  from  rapid 
deceleration or from impact of the chest against the steering wheel, but 
can also result from falls from heights, crush injuries, blast injuries, and 
violent assault. Importantly, rapid deceleration following motor vehicle 
accidents may be associated with significant cardiac injury even in the 
absence of external signs of thoracic trauma.
 ■ BLUNT CARDIAC INJURY
Myocardial  contusion  is  a  nonspecific  term  that  has  been  used  to 
describe  a  broad  spectrum  of  nonpenetrating  cardiac  injuries  that 
result  in  abnormalities  on  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  elevation  in 
cardiac  biomarkers,  and  acute  structural  cardiac  abnormalities  
(Table  272-1).  Importantly,  the  cardiac  injury  may  initially  be  over-
looked in trauma patients as the clinical focus is directed toward other, 
more  obvious  injuries.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  one  sign  or  symp-
tom that confirms the diagnosis of BCI, and clinical, laboratory, and 
radiographic findings may be nonspecific in the setting of significant 
trauma. The physical examination may be challenging in the setting of 
chest  wall  injury;  however,  patients  should  be  carefully  examined  to 
detect pericardial rubs, cardiac murmurs, and evidence of pericardial 
tamponade (Chap. 270). The mechanism of injury and the presence of 
other chest trauma should be considered when determining the index 
of suspicion for BCI; however, there is no proven association between 
sternal or rib fractures and the presence of BCI, and significant cardiac 
injury may be present in the absence of chest wall abnormalities.

Chest  pain  is  common  following  thoracic  trauma,  and  while  it 
could  indicate  cardiac  ischemia  or  pericardial  injury,  it  often  reflects 
musculoskeletal trauma. Nonetheless, myocardial necrosis may occur 
as a direct result of the blunt injury or as a result of traumatic coro-
nary laceration, dissection, or thrombosis. The injured myocardium is 
pathologically similar to infarcted myocardium and may be associated 
with atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disturbances includ-
ing bundle branch block, or abnormalities on ECG resembling those of 
infarction or pericarditis. Thus, it is important to obtain an ECG in all 
patients presenting with chest trauma and consider BCI as a cause of 
otherwise unexplained ECG abnormalities.

Serum creatine kinase, myocardial band (CK-MB) isoenzyme levels 
are increased in ~20% of patients who experience blunt chest trauma 
but may be falsely elevated in the presence of massive skeletal muscle 
injury and should not be relied upon to confirm the diagnosis of BCI 
in the setting of trauma. Cardiac troponin levels are more specific for 
identifying cardiac damage; patients with normal serial troponin lev-
els after chest trauma are very unlikely to have cardiac injury. When 
combined with a normal ECG, a normal troponin level at 6–8 h after 
chest trauma essentially excludes BCI. Echocardiography is the most 
useful modality for the detection of structural and functional sequelae 
of BCI, including regional wall motion abnormalities (most commonly 
involving  the  right  ventricle,  interventricular  septum,  or  left  ventric-
ular apex), pericardial effusion, valvular dysfunction, and ventricular 
rupture. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) should be performed 
in all patients with suspected BCI, especially in those with an abnormal 
ECG, elevated troponin, or hemodynamic instability; transesophageal 
echocardiography should be considered for patients in whom adequate 
TTE images cannot be obtained.

Traumatic  rupture  of  the  cardiac  valves  or  their  supporting  struc-
tures, most commonly of the tricuspid or mitral valve, leads to acute 
valvular  incompetence.  This  complication  is  usually  heralded  by 
the  development  of  a  loud  murmur,  may  be  associated  with  rapidly 
progressive  heart  failure,  and  can  be  diagnosed  by  either  TTE  or 
transesophageal echocardiography.

The most serious consequence of nonpenetrating cardiac injury is 
myocardial rupture, which may result in hemopericardium and tam-
ponade (free wall rupture) or intracardiac shunting (ventricular septal 
rupture). Although generally fatal, up to 40% of patients with cardiac 
rupture have been reported to survive long enough to reach a special-
ized trauma center. Hemopericardium also may result from traumatic 
rupture of a pericardial vessel or a coronary artery. Additionally, peri-
carditis and/or pericardial effusion may develop weeks or even months 
after blunt chest trauma as a manifestation of the post–cardiac injury 
syndrome, an inflammatory condition that resembles the postpericar-
diotomy syndrome (Chap. 270).

Blunt,  nonpenetrating,  often  innocent-appearing  injuries  to  the 
chest may trigger ventricular fibrillation even in the absence of struc-
tural  myocardial  damage.  This  syndrome,  referred  to  as  commotio 
cordis,  occurs  most  often  in  adolescents  during  sporting  events  (e.g., 
baseball, hockey, football, and lacrosse) and is an electrical phenom-
enon that probably results from an impact to the chest wall overlying 
the  heart  during  the  susceptible  phase  of  repolarization  (just  before 
the  peak  of  the  T  wave).  Survival  depends  on  prompt  defibrillation. 
Sudden  emotional  or  physical  trauma,  even  in  the  absence  of  direct 
cardiac  trauma,  may  precipitate  a  transient  catecholamine-mediated 
cardiomyopathy referred to as takotsubo syndrome or apical ballooning 
syndrome (Chap. 259).

Rupture  or  transection  of  the  aorta,  usually  just  above  the  aortic 
valve or at the site of the ligamentum arteriosum, is a common con-
sequence  of  nonpenetrating  chest  trauma  and  is  the  most  common 
vascular deceleration injury. The clinical presentation may be similar 
to that of aortic dissection (Chap. 280); the arterial pressure and pulse 
amplitude  may  be  increased  in  the  upper  extremities  and  decreased 
in the lower extremities, and chest x-ray may reveal mediastinal wid-
ening. Aortic rupture into the left thoracic space is almost universally 
fatal; however, the rupture may occasionally be contained by the aortic 
adventitia, resulting in a false, or pseudo-, aneurysm that may be dis-
covered months or years after the initial injury.

other  specific  cardiac  treatment  is  not  usually  required  in  the 
absence of the development of arrhythmias. Patients with mechani-
cal complications (acute valvular insufficiency, myocardial rupture) 
require urgent operative correction.

 ■ PENETRATING CARDIAC INJURY
Penetrating  injuries  of  the  heart  produced  by  knife  or  bullet  wounds 
usually  result  in  rapid  clinical  deterioration  and  frequently  in  death 
as  a  result  of  hemopericardium/pericardial  tamponade  or  massive 
hemorrhage. Nonetheless, up to half of such patients may survive long 
enough to reach a specialized trauma center if immediate resuscitation 
is  performed.  Prognosis  in  these  patients  relates  to  the  mechanism 
of  injury,  the  specific  cardiac  chamber(s)  involved,  and  their  clinical 
condition at presentation. In general, gunshot wounds are associated 
with a higher mortality than are knife wounds; up to 65% of stabbing 
victims survive versus <20% of shooting victims. This is likely in part 
because  ballistic  wounds  are  more  frequently  associated  with  multi-
chamber cardiac injury. As a result of its anterior position in the chest, 
the right ventricle (RV) is the most frequently injured cardiac chamber, 
followed by the left ventricle (LV); isolated atrial injury is uncommon. 
Some studies suggest that RV injuries may be associated with a better 
prognosis than LV injuries, and most reports indicate that multicham-
ber involvement carries a worse prognosis than single-chamber injury. 
Patients who are in hemodynamic collapse at presentation to the emer-
gency department have a particularly poor prognosis with a mortality 
rate approaching 90%, whereas ~75% of patients who are stable enough 
to be brought to the operating room will survive.

Cardiac  perforation  of  the  right  atrium,  the  RV  free  wall,  or  the 
interventricular  septum  may  occur  as  a  complication  of  cardiac  pro-
cedures  including  during  placement  of  central  venous/intracardiac 
catheters,  insertion  of  pacemaker/defibrillator  leads,  or  performance 
of RV endomyocardial biopsies, and coronary arterial perforation can 
occur  during  deployment  of  intracoronary  stents.  These  iatrogenic 
injuries are associated with a better prognosis than are other forms of 
penetrating cardiac trauma, likely related to a more limited degree of 
cardiac injury and the rapid availability of corrective therapies.

Traumatic rupture of a great vessel from penetrating injury is usually 
associated  with  hemothorax  and,  less  often,  hemopericardium,  both 
of  which  are  associated  with  significant  mortality.  Local  hematoma 
formation may compress adjacent vessels and produce ischemic symp-
toms, and arteriovenous fistulas may develop, occasionally resulting in 
high-output heart failure.

Some patients with penetrating chest injuries are hemodynamically 
stable at presentation and without symptoms to suggest cardiac injury; 
however, as many as 20% of these patients will have occult penetrating 
cardiac trauma. As a result, there should always be a high index of sus-
picion for cardiac injury in any patient with penetrating chest trauma, 
irrespective of clinical stability. TTE should be performed in all of these 
patients to assess for the presence of pericardial effusion or hematoma.
Occasionally, patients who survive penetrating cardiac injuries may 
subsequently present days or weeks later with a new cardiac murmur 
or  heart  failure  as  a  result  of  mitral  or  tricuspid  regurgitation  or  an 
intracardiac shunt (i.e., ventricular or atrial septal defect, aortopulmo-
nary fistula, or coronary arteriovenous fistula) that was undetected at 
the time of the initial injury or developed subsequently (Fig. 272-1). 
Therefore, trauma patients should be examined carefully several weeks 
after  the  injury.  If  a  mechanical  complication  is  suspected,  it  can  be 
confirmed by echocardiography or cardiac catheterization.

Penetrating Cardiac Injury

The  treatment  of  BCI  depends  on  the  specific  injury  sustained. 
Hemodynamically stable patients with a normal ECG and normal 
serial  troponin  levels  are  at  low  risk  for  BCI  and  usually  do  not 
require  hospital  admission  for  cardiac  issues.  Patients  with  an 
abnormal  ECG  and/or  elevated  troponin  but  normal  echocardio-
gram  usually  warrant  24–48  h  of  telemetry  monitoring;  however, 

Penetrating  cardiac  injury  associated  with  hemodynamic  insta-
bility  is  a  surgical  emergency  and  requires  immediate  resuscita-
tive measures including endotracheal intubation, establishment of 
large-bore intravenous access to facilitate massive volume resuscita-
tion, and immediate thoracotomy to allow for pericardial drainage 
and repair of cardiac injuries. Occasionally, cross-clamping of the

to the development of constriction (Chap. 270), which may require 
surgical decortication.

Vascular Disease

273 Ischemic Heart Disease

Elliott M. Antman, Joseph Loscalzo

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a condition in which there is an inad-
equate  supply  of  blood  and  oxygen  to  a  portion  of  the  myocardium; 
it  typically  occurs  when  there  is  an  imbalance  between  myocardial 
oxygen  supply  and  demand.  The  most  common  cause  of  myocardial 
ischemia  is  atherosclerotic  disease  of  an  epicardial  coronary  artery 
(or  arteries)  sufficient  to  cause  a  regional  reduction  in  myocardial 
blood  flow  and  inadequate  perfusion  of  the  myocardium  supplied 
by the involved coronary artery. This chapter focuses on the chronic 

manifestations  and  treatment  of  IHD,  while  the  subsequent  chapters 
address the acute phases of IHD.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL TRENDS
IHD  causes  more  deaths  and  disability  and  incurs  greater  economic 
costs than any other illness in the developed world. IHD is the most 
common, serious, chronic, life-threatening illness in the United States, 
where  20.1  million  persons  have  IHD.  Although  there  is  regional 
variation, ~3–4% of the population has sustained a myocardial infarc-
tion.  Genetic  factors,  a  high-fat  and  energy-rich  diet,  smoking,  and 
a  sedentary  lifestyle  are  associated  with  the  emergence  of  IHD.  In 
the  United  States  and  Western  Europe,  IHD  is  growing  among  low- 
income groups, but primary prevention has delayed the disease to later 
in life across socioeconomic groups. Despite these sobering statistics, 
it is worth noting that epidemiologic data show a decline in the rate of 
deaths due to IHD, about half of which is attributable to treatments and 
half to prevention by risk factor modification.

Obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are increas-
ing and are powerful risk factors for IHD. These trends are occurring in 
the general context of population growth and as a result of the increase 
in  the  average  age  of  the  world’s  population.  With  urbanization  in 
countries with emerging economies and a growing middle class, ele-
ments of the energy-rich Western diet are being adopted. As a result, 
the prevalence of risk factors for IHD and the prevalence of IHD itself 
are  both  increasing  rapidly,  so  that  in  analyses  of  the  global  burden 
of  disease,  there  is  a  shift  from  communicable  to  noncommunicable 
diseases, and it is estimated that globally 197.2 million people live with 
IHD. Population subgroups that appear to be particularly affected are 
men  in  South  Asian  countries,  especially  India  and  the  Middle  East. 
IHD is a major contributor to the number of disability-adjusted life-
years (DALYs) experienced globally.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Central  to  an  understanding  of  the  pathophysiology  of  myocardial 
ischemia is the concept of myocardial supply and demand. In normal 
conditions, for any given level of a demand for oxygen, the myocardium 
will control the supply of oxygen-rich blood to prevent underperfusion 
of myocytes and the subsequent development of ischemia and infarc-
tion. The major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand (MVO2) 
are  heart  rate,  myocardial  contractility,  and  myocardial  wall  tension 
(stress). An adequate supply of oxygen to the myocardium requires a 
satisfactory level of oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (determined 
by the inspired level of oxygen, pulmonary function, and hemoglobin 
concentration and function) and an adequate level of coronary blood

flow.  Blood  flows  through  the  coronary  arteries  in  a  phasic  fashion, 
with  the  majority  occurring  during  diastole.  About  75%  of  the  total 
coronary  resistance  to  flow  occurs  across  three  sets  of  arteries:  (1) 
large  epicardial  arteries  (Resistance  1  =  R1),  (2)  prearteriolar  vessels 
(R2),  and  (3)  arteriolar  and  intramyocardial  capillary  vessels  (R3).  In 
the  absence  of  significant  flow-limiting  atherosclerotic  obstructions, 
R1 is trivial; the major determinant of coronary resistance is found in 
R2 and R3 (Fig. 273-1). The normal coronary circulation is dominated 
and controlled by the heart’s requirements for oxygen. This need is met 
by the ability of the coronary vascular bed to vary its resistance (and, 
therefore,  blood  flow)  considerably  while  the  myocardium  extracts  a 
high and relatively fixed percentage of oxygen. Normally, intramyocar-
dial resistance vessels demonstrate a great capacity for dilation (R2 and 
R3 decrease). For example, the changing oxygen needs of the heart with 
exercise and emotional stress affect coronary vascular resistance and, 
in this manner, regulate the supply of oxygen and substrate to the myo-
cardium  (metabolic  regulation).  The  coronary  resistance  vessels  also 
adapt to physiologic alterations in blood pressure to maintain coronary 
blood flow at levels appropriate to myocardial needs (autoregulation).

By  reducing  the  lumen  of  the  coronary  arteries,  atherosclerosis 
limits appropriate increases in perfusion when the demand for more 
coronary flow occurs. When the luminal reduction is severe, myocar-
dial perfusion in the basal state is reduced. Coronary blood flow also 
can be limited by spasm (see Prinzmetal’s angina in Chap. 274), arterial 
thrombi,  and,  rarely,  coronary  emboli  as  well  as  by  ostial  narrowing 
due to aortitis. Congenital abnormalities such as the origin of the left 
anterior descending coronary artery from the pulmonary artery may 
cause myocardial ischemia and infarction in infancy, but this cause is 
very rare in adults.

Myocardial ischemia also can occur if myocardial oxygen demands 
are  markedly  increased  and  particularly  when  coronary  blood  flow 
may be limited, as occurs in severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) 
due to aortic stenosis. The latter can present with angina that is indis-
tinguishable  from  that  caused  by  coronary  atherosclerosis  largely 
owing  to  subendocardial  ischemia  (Chap.  261).  A  reduction  in  the 
oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, as in extremely severe anemia 
or  in  the  presence  of  carboxyhemoglobin,  rarely  causes  myocardial 
ischemia by itself but may lower the threshold for ischemia in patients 
with moderate coronary obstruction.

Not  infrequently,  two  or  more  causes  of  ischemia  coexist  in  a 
patient, such as an increase in oxygen demand due to LVH secondary 

to  hypertension  and  a  reduction  in  oxygen  supply  secondary  to  cor-
onary  atherosclerosis  and  anemia.  Abnormal  constriction  or  failure 
of  normal  dilation  of  the  coronary  resistance  vessels  also  can  cause 
ischemia.  When  it  causes  angina,  this  condition  is  referred  to  as 
microvascular angina.

CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS
Epicardial  coronary  arteries  are  the  major  site  of  atherosclerotic  dis-
ease. The major risk factors for atherosclerosis (high levels of plasma 
low-density  lipoprotein  [LDL],  cigarette  smoking,  hypertension,  and 
diabetes mellitus) vary in their relative impact on disturbing the nor-
mal  functions  of  the  vascular  endothelium.  These  functions  include 
local  control  of  vascular  tone,  maintenance  of  an  antithrombotic 
surface,  and  control  of  inflammatory  cell  adhesion  and  diapedesis. 
The loss of these defenses leads to inappropriate constriction, luminal 
thrombus formation, and abnormal interactions between blood cells, 
especially  monocytes  and  platelets,  and  the  activated  vascular  endo-
thelium. Functional changes in the vascular milieu ultimately result in 
the subintimal collections of fat, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and 
intercellular matrix that define the atherosclerotic plaque. Rather than 
viewing  atherosclerosis  strictly  as  a  vascular  problem,  it  is  useful  to 
consider it in the context of alterations in the nature of the circulating 
blood  (hyperglycemia;  increased  concentrations  of  LDL  cholesterol, 
tissue factor, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, coagulation factor VII, 
and platelet microparticles). The combination of a “vulnerable vessel” 
in  a  patient  with  “vulnerable  blood”  promotes  a  state  of  hypercoag-
ulability and hypofibrinolysis. This is especially true in patients with 
diabetes mellitus.

Atherosclerosis develops at irregular rates in different segments of 
the epicardial coronary tree and leads eventually to segmental reduc-
tions  in  cross-sectional  area,  i.e.,  plaque  formation.  There  is  also  a 
predilection for atherosclerotic plaques to develop at sites of increased 
turbulence in coronary flow, such as at branch points in the epicardial 
arteries. When a stenosis reduces the diameter of an epicardial artery 
by  50%,  there  is  a  limitation  of  the  ability  to  increase  flow  to  meet 
increased myocardial demand. When the diameter is reduced by ~80%, 
blood flow at rest may be reduced, and further minor decreases in the 
stenotic  orifice  area  can  reduce  coronary  flow  dramatically  to  cause 
myocardial ischemia at rest or with minimal stress.

Segmental  atherosclerotic  narrowing  of  epicardial  coronary  arter-
ies is caused most commonly by the formation of a plaque, which is 

HPIM21e_Part6_p1797-p2130.indd   2031

21/01/22   6:24 PM

 
 
 
2032 subject  to  rupture  or  erosion  of  the  cap  separating  the  plaque  from 
the bloodstream. Upon exposure of the plaque contents to blood, two 
important  and  interrelated  processes  are  set  in  motion:  (1)  platelets 
are  activated  and  aggregate,  and  (2)  the  coagulation  cascade  is  acti-
vated, leading to deposition of fibrin strands. A thrombus composed 
of platelet aggregates and fibrin strands traps red blood cells and can 
reduce  coronary  blood  flow,  leading  to  the  clinical  manifestations  of 
myocardial ischemia.

The location of the obstruction influences the quantity of myocar-
dium  rendered  ischemic  and  determines  the  severity  of  the  clinical 
manifestations.  Thus,  critical  obstructions  in  vessels,  such  as  the 
left  main  coronary  artery  and  the  proximal  left  anterior  descending 
coronary  artery,  are  particularly  hazardous.  Chronic  severe  coronary 
narrowing and myocardial ischemia frequently are accompanied by the 
development of collateral vessels, especially when the narrowing devel-
ops  gradually.  When  well  developed,  such  vessels  can  by  themselves 
provide sufficient blood flow to sustain the viability of the myocardium 
at rest but not during conditions of increased demand.

With  progressive  worsening  of  a  stenosis  in  a  proximal  epicardial 
artery,  the  distal  resistance  vessels  (when  they  function  normally) 
dilate  to  reduce  vascular  resistance  and  maintain  coronary  blood 
flow.  A  pressure  gradient  develops  across  the  proximal  stenosis,  and 
poststenotic pressure falls. When the resistance vessels are maximally 
dilated, myocardial blood flow becomes dependent on the pressure in 
the coronary artery distal to the obstruction. In these circumstances, 
ischemia, manifest clinically by angina or electrocardiographically by 
ST-segment deviation, can be precipitated by increases in myocardial 
oxygen  demand  caused  by  physical  activity,  emotional  stress,  and/or 
tachycardia.  Changes  in  the  caliber  of  the  stenosed  coronary  artery 
resulting  from  physiologic  vasomotion,  loss  of  endothelial  control  of 
dilation (as occurs in atherosclerosis), pathologic spasm (Prinzmetal’s 
angina), or small platelet-rich plugs also can upset the critical balance 
between oxygen supply and demand and thereby precipitate myocar-
dial ischemia.
 ■ EFFECTS OF ISCHEMIA
During  episodes  of  inadequate  perfusion  caused  by  coronary  ath-
erosclerosis,  myocardial  tissue  oxygen  tension  falls  and  may  cause 
transient  disturbances  of  the  mechanical,  biochemical,  and  electrical 
functions of the myocardium (Fig. 273-2). Coronary atherosclerosis is 
a focal process that usually causes nonuniform ischemia. During ische-
mia, regional disturbances of ventricular contractility cause segmental 

hypokinesia, akinesia, or, in severe cases, bulging (dyskinesia), which 
can reduce myocardial pump function.

The abrupt development of severe ischemia, as occurs with total or 
subtotal coronary occlusion, is associated with near instantaneous fail-
ure of normal muscle relaxation and then diminished contraction. The 
relatively poor perfusion of the subendocardium causes more intense 
ischemia of this portion of the wall (compared with the subepicardial 
region).  Ischemia  of  large  portions  of  the  ventricle  causes  transient 
left  ventricular  (LV)  failure,  and  if  the  papillary  muscle  apparatus  is 
involved, mitral regurgitation can occur. When ischemia is transient, 
it may be associated with angina pectoris; when it is prolonged, it can 
lead to myocardial necrosis and scarring with or without the clinical 
picture of acute myocardial infarction (Chap. 275).

A  wide  range  of  abnormalities  in  cell  metabolism,  function,  and 
structure  underlie  these  mechanical  disturbances  during  ischemia. 
The normal myocardium metabolizes fatty acids and glucose to carbon 
dioxide and water. With severe oxygen deprivation, fatty acids cannot 
be  oxidized,  and  glucose  is  converted  to  lactate;  intracellular  pH  is 
reduced, as are the myocardial stores of high-energy phosphates, i.e., 
ATP and creatine phosphate. Impaired cell membrane function leads 
to the leakage of potassium and the uptake of sodium by myocytes as 
well as an increase in cytosolic calcium. The severity and duration of 
the imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand deter-
mine whether the damage is reversible (≤20 min for total occlusion in 
the absence of collaterals) or permanent, with subsequent myocardial 
necrosis (>20 min).

Ischemia also causes characteristic changes in the electrocardiogram 
(ECG) such as repolarization abnormalities, as evidenced by inversion 
of T waves and, when more severe, displacement of ST segments (Chap. 
240).  Transient  T-wave  inversion  probably  reflects  nontransmural, 
intramyocardial  ischemia;  transient  ST-segment  depression  often 
reflects patchy subendocardial ischemia; and ST-segment elevation is 
thought  to  be  caused  by  more  severe  transmural  ischemia.  Another 
important consequence of myocardial ischemia is electrical instability, 
which may lead to isolated ventricular premature beats or even ventric-
ular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (Chaps. 254 and 255). Most 
patients  who  die  suddenly  from  IHD  do  so  as  a  result  of  ischemia- 
induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias (Chap. 306).

coronary atherosclerosis can begin before age 20 and is present among 
adults  who  were  asymptomatic  during  life.  Exercise  stress  tests  in 
asymptomatic persons may show evidence of silent myocardial ische-
mia,  i.e.,  exercise-induced  ECG  changes  not  accompanied  by  angina 
pectoris;  coronary  angiographic  studies  of  such  persons  may  reveal 
coronary  artery  plaques  and  previously  unrecognized  obstructions 
(Chap. 242). Coronary artery calcifications (CACs) may be seen on CT 
images of the heart, can be quantified in a CAC score, and may be used 
as  adjunctive  information  to  support  a  diagnosis  of  IHD.  However, 
they should not be used as the primary screening modality or as the 
isolated basis on which to formulate therapeutic decisions. (See further 
discussion  below.)  Postmortem  examination  of  patients  with  such 
obstructions without a history of clinical manifestations of myocardial 
ischemia  often  shows  macroscopic  scars  secondary  to  myocardial 
infarction  in  regions  supplied  by  diseased  coronary  arteries,  with  or 
without collateral circulation. According to population studies, ~25% 
of patients who survive acute myocardial infarction may not come to 
medical attention, and these patients have the same adverse prognosis 
as do those who present with the classic clinical picture of acute myo-
cardial infarction (Chap. 275). Sudden death may be unheralded and is 
a common presenting manifestation of IHD (Chap. 306).

Patients  with  IHD  also  can  present  with  cardiomegaly  and  heart 
failure secondary to ischemic damage of the LV myocardium that may 
have caused no symptoms before the development of heart failure; this 
condition is referred to as ischemic cardiomyopathy. In contrast to the 
asymptomatic  phase  of  IHD,  the  symptomatic  phase  is  characterized 
by chest discomfort due to either angina pectoris or acute myocardial 
infarction  (Chap.  275).  Having  entered  the  symptomatic  phase,  the 
patient may exhibit a stable or progressive course, revert to the asymp-
tomatic stage, or die suddenly.

STABLE ANGINA PECTORIS
This  episodic  clinical  syndrome  is  a  result  of  transient  myocardial 
ischemia.  Various  diseases  that  cause  myocardial  ischemia  and  the 
numerous forms of discomfort with which it may be confused are dis-
cussed in Chap. 14. Males constitute ~70% of all patients with angina 
pectoris  and  an  even  greater  proportion  of  those  aged  <50  years.  It 
is, however, important to note that angina pectoris in women may be 
atypical in presentation (see below).

 ■ HISTORY
The  typical  patient  with  angina  is  a  man  >50  years  or  a  woman  
>60 years of age who complains of episodes of chest discomfort, usually 
described  as  heaviness,  pressure,  squeezing,  smothering,  or  choking 
and only rarely as frank pain. When the patient is asked to localize the 
sensation, he or she typically places a hand over the sternum, some-
times with a clenched fist, to indicate a squeezing, central, substernal 
discomfort  (Levine’s  sign).  Angina  is  usually  crescendo-decrescendo 
in nature (typically with the severity of the discomfort not at its most 
intense level at the outset of symptoms), typically lasts 2–5 min, and 
can radiate to either shoulder and to both arms (especially the ulnar 
aspects of the forearm and hand). It also can arise in or radiate to the 
back, interscapular region, root of the neck, jaw, teeth, and epigastrium. 
Angina is rarely localized below the umbilicus or above the mandible. 
A useful finding in assessing a patient with chest discomfort is the fact 
that myocardial ischemic discomfort does not radiate to the trapezius 
muscles; that radiation pattern is more typical of pericarditis.

Although episodes of angina typically are caused by exertion (e.g., 
exercise,  hurrying,  or  sexual  activity)  or  emotion  (e.g.,  stress,  anger, 
fright, or frustration) and are relieved by rest, they also may occur at 
rest (Chap. 274) and while the patient is recumbent (angina decubitus). 
The  patient  may  be  awakened  at  night  by  typical  chest  discomfort 
and  dyspnea.  Nocturnal  angina  may  be  due  to  episodic  tachycardia, 
diminished  oxygenation  as  the  respiratory  pattern  changes  during 
sleep, or expansion of the intrathoracic blood volume that occurs with 
recumbency; the latter causes an increase in cardiac size (end-diastolic 
volume), wall tension, and myocardial oxygen demand that can lead to 
ischemia and transient LV failure.

The threshold for the development of angina pectoris may vary by 
time of day and emotional state. Many patients report a fixed threshold 
for angina, occurring predictably at a certain level of activity, such as 
climbing two flights of stairs at a normal pace. In these patients, cor-
onary stenosis and myocardial oxygen supply are fixed, and ischemia 
is precipitated by an increase in myocardial oxygen demand; they are 
said to have stable exertional angina. In other patients, the threshold 
for angina may vary considerably within any particular day and from 
day  to  day.  In  such  patients,  variations  in  myocardial  oxygen  supply, 
most likely due to changes in coronary vasomotor tone, may play an 
important role in defining the pattern of angina. A patient may report 
symptoms  upon  minor  exertion  in  the  morning  yet  by  midday  be 
capable of much greater effort without symptoms. Angina may also be 
precipitated  by  unfamiliar  circumstances,  a  heavy  meal,  exposure  to 
cold, or a combination of these factors.

Exertional angina typically is relieved in 1–5 min by slowing or ceas-
ing activities and even more rapidly by rest and sublingual nitroglyc-
erin (see below). Indeed, the diagnosis of angina should be suspect if it 
does not respond to the combination of these measures. The severity of 
angina can be conveniently summarized by the Canadian Cardiac Soci-
ety functional classification (Table 273-1). Its impact on the patient’s 
functional  capacity  can  be  described  by  using  the  New  York  Heart 
Association functional classification (Table 273-1).

Sharp, fleeting chest pain or a prolonged, dull ache localized to the 
left submammary area is rarely due to myocardial ischemia. However, 
especially  in  women  and  diabetic  patients,  angina  pectoris  may  be 
atypical  in  location  and  not  strictly  related  to  provoking  factors.  In 
addition, this symptom may exacerbate and remit over days, weeks, or 
months. Its occurrence can be seasonal, occurring more frequently in 
the winter in temperate climates. Anginal “equivalents” are symptoms 
of  myocardial  ischemia  other  than  angina.  They  include  dyspnea,

2034 nausea, fatigue, and faintness and are more common in the elderly and 

in diabetic patients.

Systematic  questioning  of  a  patient  with  suspected  IHD  is  impor-
tant to uncover the features of an unstable syndrome associated with 
increased risk, such as angina occurring with less exertion than in the 
past, occurring at rest, or awakening the patient from sleep. Since cor-
onary atherosclerosis often is accompanied by similar lesions in other 
arteries, a patient with angina should be questioned and examined for 
peripheral  arterial  disease  (intermittent  claudication  [Chap.  281]), 
stroke, or transient ischemic attacks (Chap. 426). It is also important 
to uncover a family history of premature IHD (<55 years in first-degree 
male relatives and <65 in female relatives) and the presence of diabetes 
mellitus,  hyperlipidemia,  hypertension,  cigarette  smoking,  and  other 
risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis.

The  history  of  typical  angina  pectoris  establishes  the  diagnosis  of 
IHD  until  proven  otherwise.  Given  the  importance  of  the  history, 
clinicians  should  move  beyond  unstructured  interviews  with  the 
patient  and  consider  using  a  validated  questionnaire  (e.g.,  Seattle 
Angina Questionnaire) to establish the presence and severity of IHD. 
The coexistence of advanced age, male sex, the postmenopausal state, 
and risk factors for atherosclerosis increases the likelihood of hemo-
dynamically  significant  coronary  disease.  A  particularly  challenging 
problem is the evaluation and management of patients with persistent 
ischemic-type  chest  discomfort  but  no  flow-limiting  obstructions  in 
their epicardial coronary arteries. This situation arises more often in 
women  than  in  men.  Potential  etiologies  include  microvascular  cor-
onary  disease  (detectable  on  coronary  reactivity  testing  in  response 
to  vasoactive  agents  such  as  intracoronary  adenosine,  acetylcholine, 
and  nitroglycerin)  and  abnormal  cardiac  nociception.  Treatment  of 
microvascular  coronary  disease  should  focus  on  efforts  to  improve 
endothelial function, including nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antag-
onists,  statins,  and  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors. 
Abnormal cardiac nociception is more difficult to manage and may be 
ameliorated in some cases by imipramine.

 ■ PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The  physical  examination  is  often  normal  in  patients  with  stable 
angina when they are asymptomatic. However, because of the increased 
likelihood of IHD in patients with diabetes and/or peripheral arterial 
disease, clinicians should search for evidence of atherosclerotic disease 
at other sites, such as an abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid arterial 
bruits,  and  diminished  arterial  pulses  in  the  lower  extremities.  The 
physical examination also should include a search for evidence of risk 
factors for atherosclerosis such as xanthelasmas and xanthomas. Evi-
dence for peripheral arterial disease should be sought by evaluating the 
pulse contour at multiple locations and comparing the blood pressure 
between the arms and between the arms and the legs (ankle-brachial 
index). Examination of the fundi may reveal an increased light reflex 
and arteriovenous nicking as evidence of hypertension. There also may 
be signs of anemia, thyroid disease, and nicotine stains on the finger-
tips from cigarette smoking.

Palpation  may  reveal  cardiac  enlargement  and  abnormal  contrac-
tion of the cardiac impulse (LV dyskinesia). Auscultation can uncover 
arterial bruits, a third and/or fourth heart sound, and, if acute ische-
mia or previous infarction has impaired papillary muscle function, an 
apical systolic murmur due to mitral regurgitation. These auscultatory 
signs are best appreciated with the patient in the left lateral decubitus 
position. Aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation (Chap. 261), pulmonary 
hypertension (Chap. 283), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Chap. 
259) must be excluded, since these disorders may cause angina in the 
absence  of  coronary  atherosclerosis.  Examination  during  an  anginal 
attack  is  useful,  since  ischemia  can  cause  transient  LV  failure  with  
the  appearance  of  a  third  and/or  fourth  heart  sound,  a  dyskinetic 
cardiac  apex,  mitral  regurgitation,  and  even  pulmonary  edema.  Ten-
derness of the chest wall, localization of the discomfort with a single 
fingertip on the chest, or reproduction of the pain with palpation of the 
chest makes it unlikely that the pain is caused by myocardial ischemia. 
A  protuberant  abdomen  may  indicate  that  the  patient  has  the  meta-
bolic syndrome and is at increased risk for atherosclerosis.

 ■ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
Although  the  diagnosis  of  IHD  can  be  made  with  a  high  degree  of 
confidence  from  the  history  and  physical  examination,  a  number  of 
simple  laboratory  tests  can  be  helpful.  The  urine  should  be  exam-
ined  for  evidence  of  diabetes  mellitus  and  renal  disease  (including 
microalbuminuria)  since  these  conditions  accelerate  atherosclerosis. 
Similarly,  examination  of  the  blood  should  include  measurements  of 
lipids (cholesterol—total, LDL, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]—and 
triglycerides), glucose (hemoglobin A1C), creatinine, hematocrit, and, if 
indicated based on the physical examination, thyroid function. A chest 
x-ray may be helpful in demonstrating the consequences of IHD, i.e., 
cardiac  enlargement,  ventricular  aneurysm,  or  signs  of  heart  failure. 
These  signs  can  support  the  diagnosis  of  IHD  and  are  important  in 
assessing the degree of cardiac damage. Evidence exists that an elevated 
level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) (specifically, between 
1 and 3 mg/L) is an independent risk factor for IHD and may be useful 
in therapeutic decision-making about the initiation of hypolipidemic 
treatment. The major benefit of high-sensitivity CRP is in reclassifying 
the risk of IHD in patients in the “intermediate” risk category on the 
basis of traditional risk factors.

 ■ ELECTROCARDIOGRAM
A 12-lead ECG recorded at rest may be normal in patients with typi-
cal angina pectoris, but there may also be signs of an old myocardial 
infarction  (Chap.  240).  Although  repolarization  abnormalities,  i.e., 
ST-segment and T-wave changes, as well as LVH and disturbances of 
cardiac rhythm or intraventricular conduction, are suggestive of IHD, 
they are nonspecific, since they also can occur in pericardial, myocar-
dial, and valvular heart disease or, in the case of the former, transiently 
with  anxiety,  changes  in  posture,  drugs,  or  esophageal  disease.  The 
presence of LVH is a significant indication of increased risk of adverse 
outcomes from IHD. Of note, even though LVH and cardiac rhythm 
disturbances  are  nonspecific  indicators  of  the  development  of  IHD, 
they  may  be  contributing  factors  to  episodes  of  angina  in  patients 
in  whom  IHD  has  developed  as  a  consequence  of  conventional  risk 
factors.  Dynamic  ST-segment  and  T-wave  changes  that  accompany 
episodes of angina pectoris and disappear thereafter are more specific.

 ■ STRESS TESTING
Electrocardiographic  The  most  widely  used  test  for  both  the 
diagnosis  of  IHD  and  the  estimation  of  risk  and  prognosis  involves 
recording of the 12-lead ECG before, during, and after exercise, usually 
on a treadmill (Fig. 273-3). The test consists of a standardized incre-
mental increase in external workload (Table 273-2) while symptoms, 
the ECG, and arm blood pressure are monitored. Exercise duration is 
usually symptom-limited, and the test is discontinued upon evidence of 
chest discomfort, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, severe fatigue, 
ST-segment depression >0.2 mV (2 mm), a fall in systolic blood pres-
sure >10 mmHg, or the development of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. 
This  test  is  used  to  discover  any  limitation  in  exercise  performance, 
detect  typical  ECG  signs  of  myocardial  ischemia,  and  establish  their 
relationship  to  chest  discomfort.  The  ischemic  ST-segment  response 
generally  is  defined  as  flat  or  downsloping  depression  of  the  ST 
segment  >0.1  mV  below  baseline  (i.e.,  the  PR  segment)  and  lasting 
longer  than  0.08  s  (Fig.  273-2).  Upsloping  or  junctional  ST-segment 
changes  are  not  considered  characteristic  of  ischemia  and  do  not 
constitute a positive test. Although T-wave abnormalities, conduction 
disturbances, and ventricular arrhythmias that develop during exercise 
should be noted, they are also not diagnostic. Negative exercise tests in 
which the target heart rate (85% of maximal predicted heart rate for age 
and sex) is not achieved are considered nondiagnostic.

In  interpreting  ECG  stress  tests,  the  probability  that  coronary 
artery disease (CAD) exists in the patient or population under study 
(i.e.,  pretest  probability)  should  be  considered.  A  positive  result  on 
exercise indicates that the likelihood of CAD is 98% in males who are  
>50  years  with  a  history  of  typical  angina  pectoris  and  who  develop 
chest discomfort during the test. The likelihood decreases if the patient 
has atypical or no chest pain by history and/or during the test.

The  incidence  of  false-positive  tests  is  significantly  increased  in 
patients with low probabilities of IHD, such as asymptomatic men age 
<40 or premenopausal women with no risk factors for premature ath-
erosclerosis. It is also increased in patients taking cardioactive drugs, 
such  as  digitalis  and  antiarrhythmic  agents,  and  in  those  with  intra-
ventricular  conduction  disturbances,  resting  ST-segment  and  T-wave 
abnormalities, ventricular hypertrophy, or abnormal serum potassium 
levels.  Obstructive  disease  limited  to  the  circumflex  coronary  artery 
may  result  in  a  false-negative  stress  test  since  the  posterolateral  por-
tion of the heart that this vessel supplies is not well represented on the 
surface 12-lead ECG. Since the overall sensitivity of an exercise stress 

ECG is only ~75%, a negative result does not exclude CAD, although 
it  makes  the  likelihood  of  three-vessel  or  left  main  CAD  extremely 
unlikely.

A  medical  professional  should  be  present  throughout  the  exercise 
test. It is important to measure total duration of exercise, the times to 
the  onset  of  ischemic  ST-segment  change  and  chest  discomfort,  the 
external work performed (generally expressed as the stage of exercise), 
and the internal cardiac work performed, i.e., by the heart rate–blood 
pressure product. The depth of the ST-segment depression and the time 
needed for recovery of these ECG changes are also important. Because 
the risks of exercise testing are small but real—estimated at one fatality

old avid jogger who began experiencing classic substernal chest pressure underwent an exercise echo study. With exercise the patient’s heart rate increased from 52 
to 153 beats/min. The left ventricular chamber dilated with exercise, and the septal and apical portions became akinetic to dyskinetic (red arrow). These findings are 
strongly suggestive of a significant flow-limiting stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery, which was confirmed at coronary angiography. (Modified from SD

artery territory (red arrows). (Images provided by Dr. Marcello Di Carli, Nuclear Medicine Division, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA.) D. A patient with a prior

with a large transmural myocardial infarction (marked by arrows in the middle left and right images). Resting (bottom left) and adenosine vasodilating stress (bottom right) 
first-pass perfusion images revealed reversible perfusion abnormality that extended to the inferior septum. This patient was found to have an occluded proximal left anterior

and two nonfatal complications per 10,000 tests—equipment for resus-
citation should be available. Modified (heart rate–limited rather than 
symptom-limited)  exercise  tests  can  be  performed  safely  in  patients 
as  early  as  6  days  after  uncomplicated  myocardial  infarction  (Table 
273-2). Contraindications to exercise stress testing include rest angina 
within 48 h, unstable rhythm, severe aortic stenosis, acute myocarditis, 
uncontrolled heart failure, severe pulmonary hypertension, and active 
infective endocarditis.

The  normal  response  to  graded  exercise  includes  progressive 
increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Failure of the blood pres-
sure  to  increase  or  an  actual  decrease  with  signs  of  ischemia  during 
the  test  is  an  important  adverse  prognostic  sign,  since  it  may  reflect 
ischemia-induced global LV dysfunction. The development of angina 
and/or  severe  (>0.2  mV)  ST-segment  depression  at  a  low  workload, 
i.e.,  before  completion  of  stage  II  of  the  Bruce  protocol,  and/or  ST- 
segment depression that persists >5 min after the termination of exer-
cise increases the specificity of the test and suggests severe IHD and a 
high risk of future adverse events.

Cardiac Imaging 
(See also Chap. 241) When the resting ECG is 
abnormal (e.g., preexcitation syndrome, >1 mm of resting ST-segment 
depression,  left  bundle  branch  block,  paced  ventricular  rhythm), 
information  gained  from  an  exercise  test  can  be  enhanced  by  stress 
myocardial  radionuclide  perfusion  imaging  after  the  intravenous 
administration  of  thallium-201  or  99m-technetium  sestamibi  during 
exercise (or with pharmacologic) stress. Contemporary data also sug-
gest  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  imaging  (with  exercise  or 
pharmacologic stress) using N-13 ammonia or rubidium-82 as another 
technique for assessing perfusion. Images obtained immediately after 
cessation  of  exercise  to  detect  regional  ischemia  are  compared  with 
those  obtained  at  rest  to  confirm  reversible  ischemia  and  regions  of 
persistently absent uptake that signify infarction.

A  sizable  fraction  of  patients  who  need  noninvasive  stress  testing 
to identify myocardial ischemia and increased risk of coronary events 
cannot  exercise  because  of  peripheral  vascular  or  musculoskeletal 

disease, exertional dyspnea, or deconditioning. In these circumstances, 
an  intravenous  pharmacologic  challenge  is  used  in  place  of  exercise. 
For  example,  adenosine  can  be  given  to  create  a  coronary  “steal”  by 
temporarily increasing flow in nondiseased segments of the coronary 
vasculature at the expense of diseased segments. Alternatively, a graded 
incremental infusion of dobutamine may be administered to increase 
MVO2. A variety of imaging options are available to accompany these 
pharmacologic stressors (Fig. 273-3). The development of a transient 
perfusion defect with a tracer such as thallium-201 or 99m-technetium 
sestamibi is used to detect myocardial ischemia.

Echocardiography  is  used  to  assess  LV  function  in  patients  with 
chronic  stable  angina  and  patients  with  a  history  of  a  prior  myo-
cardial  infarction,  pathologic  Q  waves,  or  clinical  evidence  of  heart 
failure. Two-dimensional echocardiography can assess both global and 
regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle that are tran-
sient when due to ischemia. Stress (exercise or dobutamine) echocar-
diography may cause the emergence of regions of akinesis or dyskinesis 
that are not present at rest. Stress echocardiography, like stress myocar-
dial perfusion imaging, is more sensitive than exercise electrocardiog-
raphy  in  the  diagnosis  of  IHD.  Cardiac  magnetic  resonance  (CMR) 
stress testing is also evolving as an alternative to radionuclide, PET, or 
echocardiographic stress imaging. CMR stress testing performed with 
dobutamine infusion can be used to assess wall motion abnormalities 
accompanying ischemia, as well as myocardial perfusion. CMR can be 
used to provide more complete ventricular evaluation using multislice 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.

Atherosclerotic  plaques  become  progressively  calcified  over  time, 
and coronary calcification in general increases with age. For this rea-
son, methods for detecting coronary calcium have been developed as 
a measure of the presence of coronary atherosclerosis. These methods 
involve  computed  tomography  (CT)  applications  that  achieve  rapid 
acquisition  of  images  (electron  beam  [EBCT]  and  multidetector 
[MDCT]  detection).  Coronary  calcium  detected  by  these  imaging 
techniques most commonly is quantified by using the Agatston score, 
which is based on the area and density of calcification.

 ■ CORONARY ARTERIOGRAPHY
(See also Chap. 242) This diagnostic method outlines the lumina of 
the  coronary  arteries  and  can  be  used  to  detect  or  exclude  serious 
coronary  obstruction.  However,  coronary  arteriography  provides  no 
information about the arterial wall, and severe atherosclerosis that does 
not encroach on the lumen may go undetected. Of note, atherosclerotic 
plaques  characteristically  are  scattered  throughout  the  coronary  tree, 
tend to occur more frequently at branch points, and grow progressively 
in the intima and media of an epicardial coronary artery at first without 
encroaching on the lumen, causing an outward bulging of the artery—a 
process referred to as remodeling. Later in the course of the disease, 
further growth causes luminal narrowing.

Indications  The ISCHEMIA trial informs decision-making about 
referral for coronary arteriography (with intent to perform revascular-
ization) in patients with stable IHD and an ejection fraction >35% even 
in the presence of moderate-severe ischemia on noninvasive functional 
testing.  Over  the  course  of  4  years  of  follow-up,  early  referral  for  an 
invasive  strategy  was  not  associated  with  a  reduction  in  the  risk  of 
myocardial infarction or death but was more effective than an initial 
conservative,  medical  strategy  in  relieving  angina.  Thus,  coronary 
arteriography  is  indicated  in  (1)  patients  with  chronic  stable  angina 
pectoris who are severely symptomatic despite medical therapy and are 
being  considered  for  revascularization,  i.e.,  a  percutaneous  coronary 
intervention  (PCI)  or  coronary  artery  bypass  grafting  (CABG);  (2) 
patients with troublesome symptoms that present diagnostic difficul-
ties in  whom  there  is  a need  to confirm or  rule out  the  diagnosis  of 
IHD;  (3)  patients  with  known  or  possible  angina  pectoris  who  have 
survived  cardiac  arrest;  and  (4)  patients  with  angina  or  evidence  of 
ischemia on noninvasive testing with clinical or laboratory evidence of 
ventricular dysfunction.

Examples  of  other  indications  for  coronary  arteriography  include 

the following:

1.  Patients  with  chest  discomfort  suggestive  of  angina  pectoris  but  a 
negative or nondiagnostic stress test who require a definitive diag-
nosis  for  guiding  medical  management,  alleviating  psychological 
stress, career or family planning, or insurance purposes.

2.  Patients  who  have  been  admitted  repeatedly  to  the  hospital  for  a 
suspected  acute  coronary  syndrome  (Chaps.  274  and  275),  but 
in  whom  this  diagnosis  has  not  been  established  and  in  whom  it 
is  considered  clinically  important  to  determine  the  presence  or 
absence of CAD.

3.  Patients  with  careers  that  involve  the  safety  of  others  (e.g.,  pilots, 
firefighters, police) who have questionable symptoms or suspicious 
or  positive  noninvasive  tests  and  in  whom  there  are  reasonable 
doubts about the state of the coronary arteries.

4.  Patients  with  aortic  stenosis  or  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  and 

angina in whom the chest pain could be due to IHD.

5.  Male patients >45 years and females >55 years who are to undergo a 
cardiac operation such as valve replacement or repair and who may 
or may not have clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia.

6.  Patients after myocardial infarction, especially those who are at high 
risk after myocardial infarction because of the recurrence of angina 
or the presence of heart failure, frequent ventricular premature con-
tractions, or signs of ischemia on the stress test.

7.  Patients in whom coronary spasm or another nonatherosclerotic cause 
of  myocardial  ischemia  (e.g.,  coronary  artery  anomaly,  Kawasaki  
disease) is suspected.

Noninvasive  alternatives  to  diagnostic  coronary  arteriography 
include CT angiography and CMR angiography (Chap. 241). Although 
these new imaging techniques can provide information about obstruc-
tive  lesions  in  the  epicardial  coronary  arteries,  their  exact  role  in 
clinical  practice  has  not  been  rigorously  defined.  Important  aspects 
of  their  use  that  should  be  noted  include  the  substantially  higher 
radiation  exposure  with  CT  angiography  compared  to  conventional 
diagnostic  arteriography  and  the  limitations  on  CMR  imposed  by 
cardiac  movement  during  the  cardiac  cycle,  especially  at  high  heart  
rates.

 ■ PROGNOSIS
The principal prognostic indicators in patients known to have IHD are 
age, the functional state of the left ventricle, the location(s) and severity 
of coronary artery narrowing, and the severity or activity of myocar-
dial ischemia. Angina pectoris of recent onset, unstable angina (Chap. 
274), early postmyocardial infarction angina, angina that is unrespon-
sive or poorly responsive to medical therapy, and angina accompanied 
by symptoms of congestive heart failure all indicate an increased risk 
for  adverse  coronary  events.  The  same  is  true  for  the  physical  signs 
of  heart  failure,  episodes  of  pulmonary  edema,  transient  third  heart 
sounds, and mitral regurgitation and for echocardiographic or radio-
isotopic  (or  roentgenographic)  evidence  of  cardiac  enlargement  and 
reduced (<0.40) ejection fraction.

Most important, any of the following signs during noninvasive test-
ing indicates a high risk for coronary events: inability to exercise for  
6 min, i.e., stage II (Bruce protocol) of the exercise test; a strongly pos-
itive exercise test showing onset of myocardial ischemia at low work-
loads (≥0.1 mV ST-segment depression before completion of stage II, 
≥0.2 mV ST-segment depression at any stage, ST-segment depression 
for >5 min after the cessation of exercise, a decline in systolic pressure 
>10  mmHg  during  exercise,  or  the  development  of  ventricular  tach-
yarrhythmias  during  exercise);  the  development  of  large  or  multiple 
perfusion defects or increased lung uptake during stress radioisotope 
perfusion imaging; and a decrease in LV ejection fraction during exer-
cise  on  radionuclide  ventriculography  or  during  stress  echocardiog-
raphy.  Conversely,  patients  who  can  complete  stage  III  of  the  Bruce 
exercise protocol and have a normal stress perfusion scan or negative 
stress echocardiographic evaluation are at very low risk for future cor-
onary events. The finding of frequent episodes of ST-segment deviation 
on ambulatory ECG monitoring (even in the absence of symptoms) is 
also an adverse prognostic finding.

On cardiac catheterization, elevations of LV end-diastolic pressure 
and  ventricular  volume  and  reduced  ejection  fraction  are  the  most 
important signs of LV dysfunction and are associated with a poor prog-
nosis. Patients with chest discomfort but normal LV function and nor-
mal coronary arteries have an excellent prognosis. Obstructive lesions 
of the left main (>50% luminal diameter) or left anterior descending 
coronary artery proximal to the origin of the first septal artery are asso-
ciated with a greater risk than are lesions of the right or left circumflex 
coronary artery because of the greater quantity of myocardium at risk. 
Atherosclerotic  plaques  in  epicardial  arteries  with  fissuring  or  filling 
defects  indicate  increased  risk.  These  lesions  go  through  phases  of 
inflammatory  cellular  activity,  degeneration,  endothelial  dysfunction, 
abnormal  vasomotion,  platelet  aggregation,  and  fissuring  or  hemor-
rhage.  These  factors  can  temporarily  worsen  the  stenosis  and  cause 
thrombosis and/or abnormal reactivity of the vessel wall, thus exacer-
bating the manifestations of ischemia. The recent onset of symptoms, 
the development of severe ischemia during stress testing (see above), 
and unstable angina pectoris (Chap. 274) all reflect episodes of rapid 
progression in coronary lesions.

With any degree of obstructive CAD, mortality is greatly increased 
when LV function is impaired; conversely, at any level of LV function, 
the prognosis is influenced importantly by the quantity of myocardium 
perfused by critically obstructed vessels. Therefore, it is essential to col-
lect all the evidence substantiating past myocardial damage (evidence 
of  myocardial  infarction  on  ECG,  echocardiography,  radioisotope 
imaging, or left ventriculography), residual LV function (ejection frac-
tion and wall motion), and risk of future damage from coronary events 
(extent of coronary disease and severity of ischemia defined by nonin-
vasive stress testing). The larger the quantity of established myocardial 
necrosis is, the less the heart is able to withstand additional damage and 
the poorer the prognosis is. Risk estimation must include age, present-
ing symptoms, all risk factors, signs of arterial disease, existing cardiac 
damage, and signs of impending damage (i.e., ischemia).

The  greater  the  number  and  severity  of  risk  factors  for  coronary 
atherosclerosis (advanced age [>75 years], hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
diabetes, morbid obesity, accompanying peripheral and/or cerebrovas-
cular disease, previous myocardial infarction), the worse the prognosis 
of an angina patient. Evidence exists that elevated levels of CRP in the

increased  carotid  intimal  thickening  on  ultrasound  examination  also 
indicate an increased risk of coronary events.

TREATMENT
Stable Angina Pectoris

Once  the  diagnosis  of  IHD  has  been  made,  each  patient  must  be 
evaluated  individually  with  respect  to  his  or  her  level  of  under-
standing,  expectations  and  goals,  control  of  symptoms,  and  pre-
vention of adverse clinical outcomes such as myocardial infarction 
and premature death. The degree of disability and the physical and 
emotional stress that precipitates angina must be recorded carefully 
to  set  treatment  goals.  The  management  plan  should  include  the 
following components: (1) explanation of the problem and reassur-
ance about the ability to formulate a treatment plan, (2) identifica-
tion and treatment of aggravating conditions, (3) recommendations 
for  adaptation  of  activity  as  needed,  (4)  treatment  of  risk  factors 
that will decrease the occurrence of adverse coronary outcomes, (5) 
drug therapy for angina, and (6) consideration of revascularization. 
EXPLANATION AND REASSURANCE
Patients with IHD need to understand their condition and realize 
that  a  long  and  productive  life  is  possible  even  though  they  have 
angina pectoris or have experienced and recovered from an acute 
myocardial  infarction.  Offering  results  of  clinical  trials  showing 
improved outcomes can be of great value in encouraging patients to 
resume or maintain activity and return to work. A planned program 
of  rehabilitation  can  encourage  patients  to  lose  weight,  improve 
exercise tolerance, and control risk factors with more confidence. 
IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF AGGRAVATING 
CONDITIONS

oxygen supply to the myocardium and may precipitate or exacerbate

angina in patients with IHD. LVH, aortic valve disease, and hyper-
trophic  cardiomyopathy  may  cause  or  contribute  to  angina  and 
should  be  excluded  or  treated.  Obesity,  hypertension,  and  hyper-
thyroidism should be treated aggressively to reduce the frequency 
and  severity  of  anginal  episodes.  Decreased  myocardial  oxygen 
supply  may  be  due  to  reduced  oxygenation  of  the  arterial  blood 
(e.g.,  in  pulmonary  disease  or,  when  carboxyhemoglobin  is  pres-
ent,  due  to  cigarette  or  cigar  smoking)  or  decreased  oxygen- 
carrying capacity (e.g., in anemia). Correction of these abnormali-
ties, if present, may reduce or even eliminate angina pectoris. 
ADAPTATION OF ACTIVITY
Myocardial  ischemia  is  caused  by  a  discrepancy  between  the 
demand  of  the  heart  muscle  for  oxygen  and  the  ability  of  the 
coronary  circulation  to  meet  that  demand.  Most  patients  can  be 
helped  to  understand  this  concept  and  utilize  it  in  the  rational 
programming of activity. Many tasks that ordinarily evoke angina 
may  be  accomplished  without  symptoms  simply  by  reducing  the 
speed  at  which  they  are  performed.  Patients  must  appreciate  the 
diurnal variation in their tolerance of certain activities and should 
reduce their energy requirements in the morning, immediately after 
meals,  and  in  cold  or  inclement  weather.  On  occasion,  it  may  be 
necessary to recommend a change in employment or residence to 
avoid physical stress.

Physical  conditioning  usually  improves  the  exercise  tolerance 
of patients with angina and has substantial psychological benefits. 
A regular program of isotonic exercise that is within the limits of 
the  individual  patient’s  threshold  for  the  development  of  angina 
pectoris and that does not exceed 80% of the heart rate associated 
with  ischemia  on  exercise  testing  should  be  strongly  encouraged. 
Based  on  the  results  of  an  exercise  test,  the  number  of  metabolic 
equivalent tasks (METs) performed at the onset of ischemia can be 
estimated (Table 273-2) and a practical exercise prescription can be 
formulated to permit daily activities that will fall below the ischemic 
threshold (Table 273-3).

TREATMENT OF RISK FACTORS
A  family  history  of  premature  IHD  is  an  important  indicator  of 
increased risk and should trigger a search for treatable risk factors 
such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Obe-
sity impairs the treatment of other risk factors and increases the risk 
of adverse coronary events. In addition, obesity often is accompa-
nied by three other risk factors: diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and 
hyperlipidemia. The treatment of obesity and these accompanying 
risk  factors  is  an  important  component  of  any  management  plan. 
A  diet  low  in  saturated  and  trans-unsaturated  fatty  acids  and  a 
reduced caloric intake to achieve optimal body weight are a corner-
stone in the management of chronic IHD. It is especially important 
to emphasize weight loss and regular exercise in patients with the 
metabolic syndrome or overt diabetes mellitus.

Cigarette  smoking  accelerates  coronary  atherosclerosis  in  both 
sexes  and  at  all  ages  and  increases  the  risk  of  thrombosis,  plaque 
instability,  myocardial  infarction,  and  death.  In  addition,  by 
increasing  myocardial  oxygen  needs  and  reducing  oxygen  supply, 
it aggravates angina. Smoking cessation studies have demonstrated 
important benefits with a significant decline in the occurrence of 
these  adverse  outcomes.  Noncombustible  tobacco  in  the  form  of 
electronic cigarettes (nicotine delivery systems) may also increase 
the frequency of anginal episodes. The physician’s message must be 
clear and strong and supported by programs that achieve and mon-
itor abstinence from all tobacco product use (Chap. 454).

Hypertension (Chap. 277) may coexist with other risk factors for 
IHD and is associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events 
from coronary atherosclerosis as well as stroke. In addition, the LVH 
that results from sustained hypertension aggravates ischemia. There 
is  evidence  that  long-term  effective  treatment  of  hypertension  can 
decrease the occurrence of adverse coronary events (Chap. 277).

Diabetes mellitus (Chap. 403) accelerates coronary and periph-
eral atherosclerosis and is frequently associated with dyslipidemia 
and increases in the risk of angina, myocardial infarction, and sud-
den coronary death. Aggressive control of the dyslipidemia (target 
LDL  cholesterol  <70  mg/dL)  and  hypertension  (blood  pressure 
<130/80  mmHg)  that  are  frequently  found  in  diabetic  patients  is 
highly effective and therefore essential, as described below. 

DYSLIPIDEMIA
The  treatment  of  dyslipidemia  is  central  in  aiming  for  long-term 
relief from angina, reduced need for revascularization, and reduc-
tion in myocardial infarction and death. The control of lipids can 
be  achieved  by  the  combination  of  a  diet  low  in  saturated  and 
trans-unsaturated  fatty  acids,  exercise,  and  weight  loss.  Nearly 
always, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are required and 
can lower LDL cholesterol (25–50%), raise HDL cholesterol (5–9%), 
and lower triglycerides (5–30%). A powerful treatment effect of sta-
tins on atherosclerosis, IHD, and outcomes is seen regardless of the 
pretreatment LDL cholesterol level. Fibrates, niacin, and icosapent 
ethyl  can  be  used  to  lower  triglycerides  (Chap.  407).  Controlled 
trials with lipid-regulating regimens have shown equal proportional 
benefit for men, women, the elderly, diabetic patients, and smokers. 
Injectable monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 are now available 
and are important disease-modifying treatments capable of produc-
ing dramatic lowering of LDL cholesterol beyond that achieved with 
a statin alone or a combination of a statin plus ezetimibe.

Compliance with the health-promoting behaviors listed above is 
generally very poor, and a conscientious physician must not under-
estimate  the  major  effort  required  to  meet  this  challenge.  Many 
patients who are discharged from the hospital with proven coronary 
disease do not receive adequate treatment for dyslipidemia. In light 
of the proof that treating dyslipidemia brings major benefits, phy-
sicians need to establish treatment pathways, monitor compliance, 
and follow up regularly. 

RISK REDUCTION IN WOMEN WITH IHD
The  incidence  of  clinical  IHD  in  premenopausal  women  is  very 
low; however, after menopause, the atherogenic risk factors increase

(e.g.,  increased  LDL)  and  the  rate  of  clinical  coronary  events 
accelerates to the levels observed in men. Diabetes mellitus, which 
is  more  common  in  women,  greatly  increases  the  occurrence  of 
clinical IHD and amplifies the deleterious effects of hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, and smoking. Cardiac catheterization and coronary 
revascularization are underused in women and are performed at a 
later and more severe stage of the disease than in men. When choles-
terol lowering, beta blockers after myocardial infarction, and CABG 
are applied in the appropriate patient groups, women benefit to the 
same degree as men. 
DRUG THERAPY
The commonly used drugs for the treatment of angina pectoris are 
summarized  in  Tables  273-4  through  273-6.  Pharmacotherapy 
for  IHD  is  designed  to  reduce  the  frequency  of  anginal  episodes,

myocardial  infarction,  and  coronary  death.  Trial  data  emphasize 
how important medical management is when added to the health- 
promoting behaviors discussed above. To achieve maximum benefit 
from  medical  therapy  for  IHD,  it  is  frequently  necessary  to  com-
bine  agents  from  different  classes  and  titrate  the  doses  as  guided 
by the individual profile of risk factors, symptoms, hemodynamic 
responses, and side effects. 
NITRATES
The organic nitrates are a valuable class of drugs in the management 
of angina pectoris (Table 273-4). Their major mechanisms of action 
include  systemic  venodilation  with  concomitant  reduction  in  LV 
end-diastolic  volume  and  pressure,  thereby  reducing  myocardial 
wall tension and oxygen requirements; dilation of epicardial coro-
nary vessels; and increased blood flow in collateral vessels. When 
metabolized,  organic  nitrates  release  nitric  oxide  (NO)  that  binds 
to guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to an 
increase  in  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate,  which  causes  relax-
ation of vascular smooth muscle. Nitrates also exert antithrombotic 
activity  by  NO-dependent  activation  of  platelet  guanylyl  cyclase, 
impairment of intraplatelet calcium flux, and platelet activation.

The  absorption  of  these  agents  is  rapid  and  complete  through 
mucous  membranes.  For  this  reason,  nitroglycerin  is  most  com-
monly administered sublingually in tablets of 0.4 or 0.6 mg. Patients 
with  angina  should  be  instructed  to  take  the  medication  both  to 
relieve  angina  and  also  ~5  min  before  activities  that  are  likely  to 
induce an episode.

Nitrates  improve  exercise  tolerance  in  patients  with  chronic 
angina and relieve ischemia in patients with unstable angina as well 
as patients with Prinzmetal’s variant angina (Chap. 274). A diary of 
angina and nitroglycerin use may be valuable for detecting changes 
in  the  frequency,  severity,  or  threshold  for  discomfort  that  may 

Long-Acting  Nitrates  None  of  the  long-acting  nitrates  is  as 
effective  as  sublingual  nitroglycerin  for  the  acute  relief  of  angina. 
These  organic  nitrate  preparations  can  be  swallowed,  chewed,  or 
administered  as  a  patch  or  paste  by  the  transdermal  route  (Table 
273-4).  They  provide  effective  plasma  levels  for  up  to  24  h,  but 
the therapeutic response is highly variable. Different preparations 
and/or administration during the daytime should be tried only to 
prevent  discomfort  while  avoiding  side  effects  such  as  headache 
and dizziness. Individual dose titration is important to prevent side 
effects. To minimize the effects of nitrate tolerance, the minimum 
effective dose should be used and a minimum of 8 h each day kept 
free of the drug to restore any useful response(s). 

a-Adrenergic Blockers  These drugs represent an important com-
ponent  of  the  pharmacologic  treatment  of  angina  pectoris  (Table 
273-5). They reduce myocardial oxygen demand by inhibiting the 
increases  in  heart  rate,  arterial  pressure,  and  myocardial  contrac-
tility caused by adrenergic activation. Beta blockade reduces these 
variables  most  strikingly  during  exercise  but  causes  only  small 
reductions  at  rest.  Long-acting  beta-blocking  drugs  or  sustained- 
release formulations offer the advantage of once-daily dosing (Table 
273-5). The therapeutic aims include relief of angina and ischemia. 
These  drugs  also  can  reduce  mortality  and  reinfarction  rates  in 
patients  after  myocardial  infarction  and  are  moderately  effective 
antihypertensive agents.

Relative contraindications include asthma and reversible airway 
obstruction in patients with chronic lung disease, atrioventricular 
conduction disturbances, severe bradycardia, Raynaud’s phenome-
non, and a history of mental depression. Side effects include fatigue, 
reduced  exercise  tolerance,  nightmares,  impotence,  cold  extrem-
ities,  intermittent  claudication,  bradycardia  (sometimes  severe), 
impaired atrioventricular conduction, LV failure, bronchial asthma, 
worsening  claudication,  and  intensification  of  the  hypoglycemia 
produced  by  oral  hypoglycemic  agents  and  insulin.  Reducing  the 
dose or even discontinuation may be necessary if these side effects 
develop  and  persist.  Since  sudden  discontinuation  can  intensify 
ischemia, the doses should be tapered over 2 weeks. Beta blockers 
with relative β1-receptor specificity such as metoprolol and atenolol 
may be preferable in patients with mild bronchial obstruction and 
insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus. 

Calcium Channel Blockers  Calcium channel blockers (Table 273-6) 
are coronary vasodilators that produce variable and dose-dependent 
reductions in myocardial oxygen demand, contractility, and arterial 
pressure. These combined pharmacologic effects are advantageous 
and  make  these  agents  as  effective  as  beta  blockers  in  the  treat-
ment  of  angina  pectoris.  They  are  indicated  when  beta  blockers 
are  contraindicated,  poorly  tolerated,  or  ineffective.  Because  of 
differences  in  the  dose-response  relationship  on  cardiac  electrical 
activity  between  the  dihydropyridine  and  nondihydropyridine 
calcium  channel  blockers,  verapamil  and  diltiazem  may  produce 
symptomatic disturbances in cardiac conduction and bradyarrhyth-
mias. They also exert negative inotropic actions and are more likely 
to  aggravate  LV  failure,  particularly  when  used  in  patients  with 
LV  dysfunction,  especially  if  the  patients  are  also  receiving  beta 
blockers. Although useful effects usually are achieved when calcium 
channel  blockers  are  combined  with  beta  blockers  and  nitrates, 
individual  titration  of  the  doses  is  essential  with  these  combina-
tions.  Variant  (Prinzmetal’s)  angina  responds  particularly  well  to 
calcium channel blockers (especially members of the dihydropyri-
dine class), supplemented when necessary by nitrates (Chap. 274).
Verapamil ordinarily should not be combined with beta blockers 
because of the combined adverse effects on heart rate and contrac-
tility.  Diltiazem  can  be  combined  with  beta  blockers  in  patients 
with normal ventricular function and no conduction disturbances. 
Amlodipine and beta blockers have complementary actions on cor-
onary blood supply and myocardial oxygen demands. Whereas the

former decreases blood pressure and dilates coronary arteries, the 
latter slows heart rate and decreases contractility. Amlodipine and 
the  other  second-generation  dihydropyridine  calcium  antagonists 
(nicardipine, isradipine, long-acting nifedipine, and felodipine) are 
potent vasodilators and are useful in the simultaneous treatment of 
angina and hypertension. Short-acting dihydropyridines should be 
avoided because of the risk of precipitating infarction, particularly 
in the absence of concomitant beta blocker therapy. 
Choice Between Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel Blockers for 
Initial Therapy  Since beta blockers have been shown to improve 
life expectancy after acute myocardial infarction (Chaps. 274 and 
275) and calcium channel blockers have not, the former may also 
be preferable in patients with angina and a damaged left ventricle. 
However,  calcium  channel  blockers  are  indicated  in  patients  with 
the  following:  (1)  inadequate  responsiveness  to  the  combination 
of beta blockers and nitrates; many of these patients do well with a 
combination of a beta blocker and a dihydropyridine calcium chan-
nel blocker; (2) adverse reactions to beta blockers such as depres-
sion, sexual disturbances, and fatigue; (3) angina and a history of 
asthma  or  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease;  (4)  sick-sinus 
syndrome or significant atrioventricular conduction disturbances; 
(5)  Prinzmetal’s  angina;  or  (6)  symptomatic  peripheral  arterial 
disease.

A  comparison  of  the  common  side  effects,  contraindications, 
and potential drug interactions of many of the frequently presented 
antianginal agents is shown in Table 273-7. 
Antiplatelet  Drugs  Aspirin  is  an  irreversible  inhibitor  of  plate-
let  cyclooxygenase  and  thereby  interferes  with  platelet  activation. 
Chronic administration of 75–325 mg orally per day has been shown 
to reduce coronary events in asymptomatic adult men over age 50, 
patients with chronic stable angina, and patients who have or have 
survived  unstable  angina  and  myocardial  infarction.  There  is  a 
dose-dependent  increase  in  bleeding  when  aspirin  is  used  chroni-
cally. It is preferable to use an enteric-coated formulation in the range 
of 81–162 mg/d. Administration of this drug should be considered 
in  all  patients  with  IHD  in  the  absence  of  gastrointestinal  bleed-
ing,  allergy,  or  dyspepsia.  Clopidogrel  (300–600  mg  loading  and   
75 mg/d) is an oral agent that blocks P2Y12 ADP receptor–mediated 
platelet aggregation. It provides benefits similar to those of aspirin 

in  patients  with  stable  chronic  IHD  and  may  be  substituted  for 
aspirin  if  aspirin  causes  the  side  effects  listed  above.  Clopidogrel 
combined with aspirin reduces death and coronary ischemic events 
in patients with an acute coronary syndrome (Chap. 274) and also 
reduces  the  risk  of  thrombus  formation  in  patients  undergoing 
implantation of a stent in a coronary artery (Chap. 276). Alterna-
tive antiplatelet agents that block the P2Y12 platelet receptor such as 
prasugrel and ticagrelor have been shown to be more effective than 
clopidogrel for prevention of ischemic events after placement of a 
stent  for  an  acute  coronary  syndrome  but  are  associated  with  an 
increased risk of bleeding. Although combined treatment with clop-
idogrel and aspirin for at least a year is recommended in patients 
with  an  acute  coronary  syndrome  treated  with  implantation  of  a 
drug-eluting  stent,  studies  have  not  shown  any  benefit  from  the 
routine addition of clopidogrel to aspirin in patients with chronic 
stable IHD. 

OTHER THERAPIES
The ACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of survivors 
of  myocardial  infarction,  patients  with  hypertension  or  chronic 
IHD including angina pectoris, and those at high risk of vascular 
diseases such as diabetes. The benefits of ACE inhibitors are most 
evident in IHD patients at increased risk, especially if diabetes mel-
litus or LV dysfunction is present, and those who have not achieved 
adequate  control  of  blood  pressure  and  LDL  cholesterol  on  beta 
blockers and statins. However, the routine administration of ACE 
inhibitors to IHD patients who have normal LV function and have 
achieved blood pressure and LDL goals on other therapies does not 
reduce the incidence of events and therefore is not cost-effective.

Despite treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, or calcium chan-
nel  blockers,  some  patients  with  IHD  continue  to  experience 
angina, and additional medical therapy is now available to alleviate 
their symptoms. Ranolazine, a piperazine derivative, may be useful 
for patients with chronic angina despite standard medical therapy 
(Table 273-7). Its antianginal action is believed to occur via inhi-
bition  of  the  late  inward  sodium  current  (INa).  The  benefits  of  INa 
inhibition include limitation of the Na overload of ischemic myo-
cytes and prevention of Ca2+ overload via the Na+–Ca2+ exchanger. 
A dose of 500–1000 mg orally twice daily is usually well tolerated. 
Ranolazine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment

or with conditions or drugs associated with QTc prolongation and 
when drugs that inhibit the CYP3A metabolic system (e.g., ketoco-
nazole,  diltiazem,  verapamil,  macrolide  antibiotics,  HIV  protease 
inhibitors, and large quantities of grapefruit juice) are being used.
Originally  introduced  for  the  management  of  diabetes  melli-
tus, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) drugs 
have  emerged  as  important  agents  with  cardiovascular  and  renal 
protective effects. They promote weight loss, lower blood pressure, 
and reduce plasma volume—all of which are desirable in patients 
with  IHD.  In  addition,  they  decrease  intraglomerular  hyperten-
sion  and  hyperfiltration.  Evidence  exists  that  they  are  helpful  in 
patients  with  and  without  diabetes  who  have  a  reduced  LV  ejec-
tion fraction. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use 
in  patients  with  IHD  may  be  associated  with  a  small  but  finite 
increased  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  and  mortality.  For  this 
reason, they generally should be avoided in IHD patients. If they 
are  required  for  symptom  relief,  it  is  advisable  to  coadminister 
aspirin and strive to use an NSAID associated with the lowest risk 
of cardiovascular events, in the lowest dose required, and for the 
shortest period of time.

Another class of agents opens ATP-sensitive potassium channels 
in  myocytes,  leading  to  a  reduction  of  free  intracellular  calcium 
ions. The major drug in this class is nicorandil, which typically is 
administered orally in a dose of 20 mg twice daily for prevention of 
angina. (Nicorandil is not available for use in the United States but 
is used in several other countries.)

Ivabradine (2.5–7.5 mg orally twice daily) is a specific sinus node 
inhibiting agent that may be helpful for preventing cardiovascular 
events in patients with IHD who have a resting heart rate ≥70 beats/
min (alone or in combination with a beta blocker) and LV systolic 
dysfunction. 
Angina and Heart Failure  Transient LV failure with angina can be 
controlled by the use of nitrates. For patients with established con-
gestive heart failure, the increased LV wall tension raises myocardial 
oxygen demand. Treatment of congestive heart failure (Chap. 257) 
reduces  heart  size,  wall  tension,  and  myocardial  oxygen  demand, 
which helps control angina and ischemia. If the symptoms and signs 
of heart failure are controlled, an effort should be made to use beta 
blockers not only for angina but because trials in heart failure have 
shown  significant  improvement  in  survival.  A  trial  of  the  intra-
venous  ultra-short-acting  beta  blocker  esmolol  may  be  useful  to 
establish the safety of beta blockade in selected patients. Nocturnal 
angina often can be relieved by the treatment of heart failure.

The  combination  of  congestive  heart  failure  and  angina  in 
patients  with  IHD  usually  indicates  a  poor  prognosis  and  war-
rants serious consideration of cardiac catheterization and coronary 
revascularization.

CORONARY REVASCULARIZATION
Clinical trials have confirmed that with the initial diagnosis of stable 
IHD, it is first appropriate to initiate a medical regimen as described 
above.  Revascularization  should  be  considered  in  the  presence  of 
unstable phases of the disease, intractable symptoms, high-risk coro-
nary anatomy, diabetes, and impaired LV function. Revascularization 
should be employed in conjunction with but not replace the continuing 
need to modify risk factors and assess medical therapy. An algorithm for 
integrating medical therapy and revascularization options in patients 
with IHD is shown in Fig. 273-4.
 ■ PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION
(See also Chap. 276) PCI involving balloon dilatation usually accom-
panied by coronary stenting is widely used to achieve revascularization 
of  the  myocardium  in  patients  with  symptomatic  IHD  and  suitable 
stenoses of epicardial coronary arteries. Whereas patients with steno-
sis  of  the  left  main  coronary  artery  and  those  with  three-vessel  IHD 
(especially  with  diabetes  and/or  impaired  LV  function)  who  require 
revascularization are best treated with CABG, PCI is widely employed 
in patients with symptoms and evidence of ischemia due to stenoses

All patients should receive the core elements of medical therapy as shown at the 
top of the algorithm. If high-risk features are present, as established by the clinical 
history, exercise test data, and imaging studies, the patient should be referred for 
coronary arteriography. Based on the number and location of the diseased vessels 
and their suitability for revascularization, the patient is treated with a percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or should 
be considered for unconventional treatments. See text for further discussion. ACS,

of  one  or  two  vessels  and  even  in  selected  patients  with  three-vessel 
disease (and, perhaps, in some patients with left main disease) and may 
offer many advantages over surgery.

Indications  and  Patient  Selection  The  most  common  clinical 
indication for PCI is symptom-limiting angina pectoris, despite medi-
cal therapy, accompanied by evidence of ischemia during a stress test. 
PCI is more effective than medical therapy for the relief of angina. PCI 
improves outcomes in patients with unstable angina or when used early 
in  the  course  of  myocardial  infarction  with  and  without  cardiogenic 
shock. However, in patients with stable exertional angina, clinical trials 
have confirmed that PCI does not reduce the occurrence of death or 
myocardial infarction compared to optimum medical therapy. PCI can 
be used to treat stenoses in native coronary arteries as well as in bypass 
grafts in patients who have recurrent angina after CABG.

Risks  When coronary stenoses are discrete and symmetric, two and 
even three vessels can be treated in sequence. However, case selection is 
essential to avoid a prohibitive risk of complications, which are usually 
due  to  dissection  or  thrombosis  with  vessel  occlusion,  uncontrolled 
ischemia,  and  ventricular  failure  (Chap.  276).  Oral  aspirin,  a  P2Y12 
antagonist,  and  an  antithrombin  agent  are  given  to  reduce  coronary 
thrombus  formation.  Left  main  coronary  artery  stenosis  generally  is

2044 regarded  as  a  lesion  that  should  be  treated  with  CABG.  In  selected 
cases such as patients with prohibitive surgical risks, PCI of an unpro-
tected  left  main  can  be  considered,  but  such  a  procedure  should  be 
performed  only  by  a  highly  skilled  operator;  importantly,  there  are 
regional differences in the use of this approach internationally.

Efficacy  Primary success, with relief of angina, is achieved in >95% 
of  cases.  Recurrent  stenosis  of  the  dilated  vessels  occurs  in  ~20%  of 
cases within 6 months of PCI with bare metal stents, and angina will 
recur within 6 months in 10% of cases. Restenosis is more common in 
patients with diabetes mellitus, arteries with small caliber, incomplete 
dilation of the stenosis, long stents, occluded vessels, obstructed vein 
grafts, dilation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and ste-
noses containing thrombi. In diseased vein grafts, procedural success 
has been improved by the use of capture devices or filters that prevent 
embolization, ischemia, and infarction.

It  is  usual  clinical  practice  to  administer  oral  aspirin  indefinitely 
and a P2Y12 antagonist for 1–3 months after the implantation of a bare 
metal  stent.  Although  aspirin  in  combination  with  a  thienopyridine 
may  help  prevent  coronary  thrombosis  during  and  shortly  after  PCI 
with stenting, there is no evidence that these medications reduce the 
incidence of restenosis.

The use of current-generation drug-eluting stents that locally deliver 
antiproliferative drugs can reduce restenosis to <5%. Advances in PCI, 
especially the availability of drug-eluting stents, have vastly extended 
the use of this revascularization option in patients with IHD. Of note, 
however,  the  delayed  endothelial  healing  in  the  region  of  a  drug- 
eluting stent also extends the period during which the patient is at risk 
for subacute stent thrombosis. Aspirin should be administered indefi-
nitely and a P2Y12 antagonist daily (dual antiplatelet therapy [DAPT]) 
for at least 1 year after implantation of a drug-eluting stent. Evidence 
exists of a benefit of continuing DAPT for up to 30 months, albeit at the 
cost of a higher risk of bleeding.

Efforts  are  underway  to  develop  new  antithrombotic  regimens. 
These  include  (1)  shortening  the  duration  of  DAPT  by  eliminating 
aspirin after 3 months and continuing a potent P2Y12 antagonist (e.g., 
ticagrelor)  and  (2)  switching  from  DAPT  to  dual  pathway  inhibition 
with an antiplatelet agent and a low-dose direct oral anticoagulant (a 
particularly  attractive  option  for  IHD  patients  who  also  have  atrial 
fibrillation). The relative benefits of such new regimens have not been 
established and no consensus has been achieved, as yet.

When  a  situation  arises  in  which  temporary  discontinuation  of 
antiplatelet therapy is necessary, the clinical circumstances should be 
reviewed with the operator who performed the PCI and a coordinated 
plan should be established for minimizing the risk of late stent throm-
bus; central to this plan is the discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy 
for  the  shortest  acceptable  period.  The  risk  of  stent  thrombosis  is 
dependent on stent size and length, complexity of the lesions, age, dia-
betes, and technique. However, compliance with DAPT and individual 
responsiveness to platelet inhibition are very important factors as well.
Successful PCI produces effective relief of angina in >95% of cases. 
The majority of patients with symptomatic IHD who require revascu-
larization can be treated initially by PCI. Successful PCI is less invasive 
and  expensive  than  CABG  and  permits  savings  in  the  initial  cost  of 
care.  Successful  PCI  avoids  the  risk  of  stroke  associated  with  CABG 
surgery and allows earlier return to work and resumption of an active 
life.  However,  the  early  health-related  and  economic  benefits  of  PCI 
are  reduced  over  time  because  of  the  greater  need  for  follow-up  and 
the increased need for repeat procedures. When directly compared in 
patients  with  diabetes  or  three-vessel  or  left  main  CAD,  CABG  was 
superior to PCI in preventing major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular 
events over a 12-month follow-up.
 ■ CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING
Anastomosis  of  one  or  both  of  the  internal  mammary  arteries  or  a 
radial artery to the coronary artery distal to the obstructive lesion is 
the  preferred  procedure.  For  additional  obstructions  that  cannot  be 
bypassed  by  an  artery,  a  section  of  a  vein  (usually  the  saphenous)  is 
used to form a venous bypass conduit between the aorta and the coro-
nary artery distal to the obstructive lesion.

Although  some  indications  for  CABG  are  controversial,  certain 

areas of agreement exist:

1.  The operation is relatively safe, with mortality rates <1% in patients 
without  serious  comorbid  disease  and  normal  LV  function  and 
when the procedure is performed by an experienced surgical team.
2.  Intraoperative  and  postoperative  mortality  rates  increase  with  the 
severity  of  ventricular  dysfunction,  comorbidities,  age  >80  years, 
and lack of surgical experience. The effectiveness and risk of CABG 
vary widely depending on case selection and the skill and experience 
of the surgical team.

3.  Occlusion of venous grafts is observed in 10–20% of patients during 
the first postoperative year and in ~2% per year during 5- to 7-year 
follow-up  and  4%  per  year  thereafter.  Long-term  patency  rates 
are  considerably  higher  for  internal  mammary  and  radial  artery 
implantations  than  for  saphenous  vein  grafts.  In  patients  with  left 
anterior descending coronary artery obstruction, survival is better 
when coronary bypass involves the internal mammary artery rather 
than a saphenous vein. Graft patency and outcomes are improved 
by meticulous treatment of risk factors, particularly dyslipidemia.
4.  Angina  is  abolished  or  greatly  reduced  in  ~90%  of  patients  after 
complete revascularization. Although this usually is associated with 
graft patency and restoration of blood flow, the pain may also have 
been alleviated as a result of infarction of the ischemic segment or 
a placebo effect.

5.  Survival may be improved by operation in patients with stenosis of 
the  left  main  coronary  artery  as  well  as  in  patients  with  three-  or 
two-vessel disease with significant obstruction of the proximal left 
anterior descending coronary artery. The survival benefit is greater 
in  patients  with  abnormal  LV  function  (ejection  fraction  <50%). 
Survival may also be improved in the following patients: (a) patients 
with obstructive CAD who have survived sudden cardiac death or 
sustained ventricular tachycardia; (b) patients who have undergone 
previous  CABG  and  have  multiple  saphenous  vein  graft  stenoses, 
especially of a graft supplying the left anterior descending coronary 
artery; and (c) patients with recurrent stenosis after PCI and high-
risk criteria on noninvasive testing.

6.  Minimally invasive CABG through a small thoracotomy and/or off-
pump surgery can reduce morbidity and shorten convalescence in 
suitable patients but does not appear to reduce significantly the risk 
of neurocognitive dysfunction postoperatively.

7.  Among  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  multivessel 
coronary  disease,  CABG  surgery  plus  optimal  medical  therapy  is 
superior  to  optimal  medical  therapy  alone  in  preventing  major 
cardiovascular  events,  a  benefit  mediated  largely  by  a  significant 
reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction. The benefits of CABG 
are  especially  evident  in  diabetic  patients  treated  with  an  insulin-
sensitizing  strategy  as  opposed  to  an  insulin-providing  strategy. 
CABG has also been shown to be superior to PCI (including the use 
of  drug-eluting  stents)  in  preventing  death,  myocardial  infarction, 
and repeat revascularization in patients with diabetes mellitus and 
multivessel IHD.

Indications  for  CABG  usually  are  based  on  the  severity  of  symp-
toms, coronary anatomy, and ventricular function. The ideal candidate 
has  no  other  complicating  disease  and  has  troublesome  or  disabling 
angina that is not adequately controlled by medical therapy or does not 
tolerate medical therapy. Great symptomatic benefit can be anticipated 
if a patient wishes to lead a more active life and has severe stenoses of 
two  or  three  epicardial  coronary  arteries  with  objective  evidence  of 
myocardial  ischemia  as  a  cause  of  the  chest  discomfort.  Congestive 
heart failure and/or LV dysfunction, advanced age (>80 years), reoper-
ation, urgent need for surgery, and the presence of diabetes mellitus are 
all associated with a higher perioperative mortality rate.

LV  dysfunction  can  be  due  to  noncontractile  or  hypocontractile 
segments  that  are  viable  but  are  chronically  ischemic  (hibernating 
myocardium).  As  a  consequence  of  chronic  reduction  in  myocardial 
blood  flow,  these  segments  downregulate  their  contractile  function. 
They can be detected by using radionuclide scans of myocardial per-
fusion  and  metabolism,  PET,  cardiac  MRI,  or  delayed  scanning  with

thallium-201  or  by  improvement  of  regional  functional 
impairment  provoked  by  low-dose  dobutamine.  In  such 
patients,  revascularization  improves  myocardial  blood 
flow, can return function, and can improve survival.

PCI

A

The  Choice  Between  PCI  and  CABG  All  the 
clinical characteristics of each individual patient must be 
used  to  decide  on  the  method  of  revascularization  (e.g., 
LV  function,  diabetes,  lesion  complexity).  A  number  of 
randomized clinical trials have compared PCI and CABG 
in  patients  with  multivessel  CAD  who  were  suitable 
technically  for  both  procedures.  The  redevelopment  of 
angina requiring repeat coronary angiography and repeat 
revascularization  is  higher  with  PCI.  This  is  a  result  of 
restenosis in the stented segment (a problem largely solved 
with  drug-eluting  stents)  and  the  development  of  new 
stenoses  in  unstented  portions  of  the  coronary  vascula-
ture. It has been argued that PCI with stenting focuses on 
culprit lesions, whereas a bypass graft to the target vessel 
also provides a conduit around future culprit lesions prox-
imal  to  the  anastomosis  of  the  graft  to  the  native  vessel 
(Fig. 273-5). By contrast, stroke rates are lower with PCI.
Based  on  available  evidence,  it  is  now  recommended 
that patients with an unacceptable level of angina despite 
optimal medical management be considered for coronary 
revascularization. Patients with single- or two-vessel dis-
ease with normal LV function and anatomically suitable 
lesions  ordinarily  are  advised  to  undergo  PCI  (Chap. 
276). Patients with three-vessel disease (or two-vessel dis-
ease that includes the proximal left descending coronary 
artery)  and  impaired  global  LV  function  (LV  ejection 
fraction  <50%)  or  diabetes  mellitus  and  those  with  left 
main CAD or other lesions unsuitable for catheter-based 
procedures should be considered for CABG as the initial 
method  of  revascularization.  In  light  of  the  complexity 
of  the  decision-making,  it  is  desirable  to  have  a  multi-
disciplinary team, including a cardiologist and a cardiac 
surgeon  in  conjunction  with  the  patient’s  primary  care 
physician,  provide  input  along  with  ascertaining  the  patient’s  prefer-
ences before committing to a particular revascularization option.
 ■ UNCONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS FOR IHD
On  occasion,  clinicians  will  encounter  a  patient  who  has  persistent, 
disabling angina despite maximally tolerated medical therapy and for 
whom revascularization is not an option (e.g., small diffusely diseased 
vessels  not  amenable  to  stent  implantation  or  acceptable  targets  for 
bypass grafting). In such situations, unconventional treatments should 
be considered.

Enhanced  external  counterpulsation  utilizes  pneumatic  cuffs  on 
the  lower  extremities  to  provide  diastolic  augmentation  and  systolic 
unloading  of  blood  pressure  to  decrease  cardiac  work  and  oxygen 
consumption while enhancing coronary blood flow. Clinical trials have 
shown that regular application improves angina, exercise capacity, and 
regional myocardial perfusion. Experimental approaches, such as stem 
cell therapies and cardiac repair with small noncoding RNA molecules 
(miRNA), are also under active study.

ASYMPTOMATIC (SILENT) ISCHEMIA
Obstructive  CAD,  acute  myocardial  infarction,  and  transient  myo-
cardial  ischemia  can  occur  in  the  absence  of  symptoms.  During 
continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring, the majority of ambulatory 
patients with typical chronic stable angina are found to have objective 
evidence of myocardial ischemia (ST-segment depression) during epi-
sodes of chest discomfort while they are active outside the hospital. In 
addition, many of these patients also have more frequent episodes of 
asymptomatic ischemia. Frequent episodes of ischemia (symptomatic 
and  asymptomatic)  during  daily  life  appear  to  be  associated  with  an 
increased likelihood of adverse coronary events (death and myocardial 
infarction).  In  addition,  patients  with  asymptomatic  ischemia  after  a 
myocardial infarction are at greater risk for a second coronary event.

FIGURE 273-5  Difference in the approach to the lesion with percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). PCI is targeted at the “culprit” lesion or lesions, 
whereas  CABG  is  directed  at  the  epicardial  vessel,  including  the  culprit  lesion  or  lesions  and 
future culprits, proximal to the insertion of the vein graft, a difference that may account for the 
superiority of CABG, at least in the intermediate term, in patients with multivessel disease. (From

The  widespread  use  of  exercise  ECG  during  routine  examinations 
has  also  identified  some  of  these  previously  unrecognized  patients 
with asymptomatic CAD. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated an 
increased incidence of coronary events in asymptomatic patients with 
positive exercise tests.

TREATMENT
Asymptomatic Ischemia

The management of patients with asymptomatic ischemia must be 
individualized.  When  coronary  disease  has  been  confirmed,  the 
aggressive treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia is essential 
and will decrease the risk of infarction and death. In addition, the 
physician  should  consider  the  following:  (1)  the  degree  of  posi-
tivity  of  the  stress  test,  particularly  the  stage  of  exercise  at  which 
ECG signs of ischemia appear; the magnitude and number of the 
ischemic zones of myocardium on imaging; and the change in LV 
ejection  fraction  that  occurs  on  radionuclide  ventriculography  or 
echocardiography during ischemia and/or during exercise; (2) the 
ECG leads showing a positive response, with changes in the anterior 
precordial leads indicating a less favorable prognosis than changes 
in the inferior leads; and (3) the patient’s age, occupation, and gen-
eral medical condition.

Most would agree that an asymptomatic 45-year-old commercial 
airline pilot with significant (0.4-mV) ST-segment depression in leads 
V1 to V4 during mild exercise should undergo coronary arteriogra-
phy, whereas an asymptomatic, sedentary 85-year-old retiree with 
0.1-mV ST-segment depression in leads II and III during maximal 
activity need not. However, there is no consensus about the most 
appropriate  approach  in  the  large  majority  of  patients  for  whom 
the  situation  is  less  extreme.  Asymptomatic  patients  with  silent

ischemia,  three-vessel  CAD,  and  impaired  LV  function  may  be 
considered appropriate candidates for CABG.

The  treatment  of  risk  factors,  particularly  lipid  lowering  and 
blood pressure control as described above, and the use of aspirin, 
statins,  and  beta  blockers  after  infarction  have  been  shown  to 
reduce  events  and  improve  outcomes  in  asymptomatic  as  well  as 
symptomatic  patients  with  ischemia  and  proven  CAD.  Although 
the  incidence  of  asymptomatic  ischemia  can  be  reduced  by  treat-
ment with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and long-acting 
nitrates,  it  is  not  clear  whether  this  is  necessary  or  desirable  in 
patients who have not had a myocardial infarction.

274 Non-ST-Segment  
Elevation Acute Coronary 
Syndrome (Non-ST- 
Segment Elevation  
Myocardial Infarction  
and Unstable Angina)
Robert P. Giugliano, Christopher P. Cannon, 
Eugene Braunwald

Patients  with  acute  coronary  syndrome  (ACS)  are  commonly  classi-
fied into two groups to facilitate evaluation and management, namely 
patients  with  acute  myocardial  infarction  (MI)  with  ST-segment 
elevation  (STEMI)  on  their  presenting  electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
(Chap. 275) and those with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary 
syndrome  (NSTE-ACS).  The  latter  include  patients  with  non-ST- 
segment elevation MI (NSTEMI), who, by definition, have evidence of 
myocyte  necrosis,  and  those  with  unstable  angina  (UA),  who  do  not 
(Fig. 274-1).

The incidence of NSTEMI is rising due to the increasing burden of 
obesity,  diabetes,  and  chronic  kidney  disease  in  an  aging  population 
and the increasing detection of myocardial necrosis by troponin (see 
below), whereas the incidence of STEMI is declining due to greater use 
of aspirin, statins, and less smoking. Among patients with NSTE-ACS, 
the proportion with NSTEMI is increasing while that with UA is falling 
because of the wider use of highly sensitive troponin (hsTn) assays (see 
below) with enhanced detection of myocyte necrosis, thereby reclassi-
fying UA to NSTEMI.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
NSTE-ACS is caused by an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply 
and demand resulting from one or more of three processes that lead to 
coronary arterial thrombosis: (1) plaque fissure with inflammation—the 
inflammatory response is reflected by an increased activity of effector 
T cells as part of an adaptive immunity dysregulation; (2) plaque fissure 
without inflammation; and (3) plaque erosion, which is present in at 
least  one-third  of  ACS  and  is  recognized  with  increasing  frequency 
(Fig. 274-2). The so-called “vulnerable plaques” responsible for ACS 
may  show  an  eccentric  stenosis  with  scalloped  or  overhanging  edges 
and a narrow neck on coronary angiography. Such plaques usually are 
composed  of  a  lipid-rich  core  with  a  thin  fibrous  cap.  Patients  with 
NSTE-ACS  frequently  have  multiple  such  plaques  that  are  at  risk  of 
disruption.  A  fourth  process,  without  thrombosis,  may  be  caused  by 
epicardial  or  microvascular  spasm  or  increased  myocardial  oxygen 
demand in the presence of fixed epicardial coronary obstruction.

Among  patients  with  NSTE-ACS  studied  at  angiography,  ~10% 
have stenosis of the left main coronary artery, 35% have three-vessel 
coronary artery disease, 20% have two-vessel disease, 20% have single- 
vessel disease, and 15% have no apparent critical epicardial coronary 
artery stenosis; some of the latter may have obstruction of the coronary 
microcirculation and/or spasm of the epicardial vessels.
 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Diagnosis  The diagnosis of NSTE-ACS is based largely on a combi-
nation of the history and clinical findings (age, the electrocardiogram, 
and circulating troponin) (Table 274-1, Fig. 274-3).

History and Physical Examination  Typically, chest discomfort 
is severe and has at least one of three features: (1) occurrence at rest 
(or  with  minimal  exertion),  lasting  >10  min;  (2)  of  relatively  recent 
onset (i.e., within the prior 2 weeks); and/or (3) a crescendo pattern, 
i.e., distinctly more severe, prolonged, or frequent than previous epi-
sodes. The diagnosis of NSTEMI is established if a patient with any of

epigastric  discomfort,  nausea,  or  weakness  may  occur  instead  of 
chest discomfort. These equivalents are more frequent in women, the 
elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination 
resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 273) and may be 
unremarkable. However, if the patient has a large area of myocardial 
ischemia  or  a  large  NSTEMI,  the  physical  findings  can  include  dia-
phoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart 
sound; basilar rales; and hypotension.

Electrocardiogram  New  ST-segment  depression  occurs  in  about 
one-third of patients with NSTE-ACS. It may be transient but can per-
sist for as long as several days following NSTEMI. T-wave changes are 
more common but are a less specific sign of ischemia, unless they are 
new and deep T-wave inversions (≥0.3 mV).

Cardiac Biomarkers  Patients with NSTEMI have elevated biomark-
ers of necrosis, such as cardiac troponin (cTn) I or T (cTnI or cTnT). 
cTns are sensitive, relatively specific, and the preferred markers of myo-
cardial  necrosis.  Elevated  levels  of  cTn  with  a  dynamic  early  change

distinguish  patients  with  NSTEMI  from  those  with  UA.  In  patients 
with  NSTEMI,  there  is  a  characteristic  temporal  rise  of  the  plasma 
concentration, peaking at 12–24 h after onset of symptoms and grad-
ually decreasing thereafter. There is a direct relationship between the 
degree of elevation and mortality. The 1-h rapid rule-out MI algorithm 
(no abnormal elevation of hsTn at 0 or 1 hour after presentation) has 
been  recommended  by  recent  practice  guidelines.  It  is  important  to 
distinguish  myocardial  injury  from  myocardial  necrosis;  the  former 
is defined by elevations of cTn >99th percentile of the upper reference 
limit in patients without a clear clinical history or electrocardiographic 
features  of  acute  myocardial  ischemia.  Myocardial  injury  may  be 
caused  by  a  variety  of  noncardiac  and  cardiac  conditions  other  than 
MI (Table 274-2).
 ■ IMAGING
Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) may be useful 
in improving the accuracy and speed of the diagnostic evaluation. The 
goals are to recognize or exclude epicardial coronary artery disease.
 ■ RISK STRATIFICATION
Patients  with  documented  NSTE-ACS  exhibit  a  wide  spectrum  of 
early  (30  days)  risk  of  death,  ranging  from  1  to  10%,  and  a  recur-
rent  ACS  rate  of  5–15%  during  the  first  year.  Assessment  of  risk 

can be accomplished by one of several clinical risk scoring systems, 
including  those  developed  from  the  Thrombolysis  in  Myocardial 
Infarction  (TIMI)  Trials,  the  Global  Registry  of  Acute  Coronary 
Event  (GRACE),  and  the  HEART  (history,  electrocardiogram,  age, 
risk factors, troponin) score (Fig. 274-3). Multibiomarker strategies 
are now gaining favor, both to define more fully the pathophysiologic 
mechanisms  underlying  a  patient’s  presentation  and  to  stratify  the 
patient’s  risk  further.  Early  risk  assessment  is  useful  in  identifying 
patients who would derive the greatest benefit from an early invasive 
strategy (see below).

TREATMENT
Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary 
Syndrome

Patients with a low likelihood of ischemia can usually be managed in 
an emergency department or a dedicated “chest pain unit.” Evaluation 
of such patients includes clinical monitoring for recurrent ischemic 
discomfort  and  continuous  monitoring  of  ECGs,  stress  testing  to 
detect  and  grade  ischemia  (Chap.  273),  CCTA  to  assess  epicardial 
coronary artery obstruction, and serum troponin. 
MEDICAL TREATMENT
Patients who “rule-in” for NSTE-ACS by clinical features, cTn, or 
ST-T-wave changes on the ECG should be admitted to the hospi-
tal.  Patients  should  be  placed  on  bed  rest  with  continuous  ECG 
monitoring  for  ST-segment  deviation  and  cardiac  arrhythmias, 
preferably  on  a  specialized  cardiac  unit.  Ambulation  is  permitted 
if the patient shows no recurrence of ischemia (symptoms or ECG 
changes) and does not develop an elevation of cTn for 24 h. They 
may proceed to stress testing to detect ischemia and, if it is present, 
to assess its severity.

Medical therapy consists of an acute phase focused on the clini-
cal symptoms and stabilization of the culprit lesion(s) and a longer- 
term  phase  that  involves  therapies  directed  at  the  prevention  of 
disease progression and future recurrent NSTE-ACS. 
ANTI-ISCHEMIC TREATMENT (TABLE 274-3)
To  provide  relief  of  pain  and  discomfort,  initial  treatment,  in 
addition  to  bed  rest,  includes  nitrates,  β-adrenergic  blockers,  and 
inhaled oxygen in patients with hypoxemia (arterial O2 saturation 
<90%) and/or in those with heart failure and rales. 
Nitrates  Nitroglycerin  should  first  be  given  sublingually  or  by 
buccal  spray  (0.3–0.6  mg)  if  the  patient  is  experiencing  ischemic 
discomfort.  If  symptoms  persist  after  three  doses  given  5  min 
apart, intravenous nitroglycerin (5–10 μg/min, using nonabsorbing 
tubing)  is  recommended.  The  infusion  rate  may  be  increased  by   
10 μg/min every 3–5 min until symptoms are relieved, systolic arte-
rial pressure falls to <90 mmHg, or the dose reaches 200 μg/min. 
Topical or oral nitrates (Chap. 273) can be used when the pain has 
resolved,  or  they  may  replace  intravenous  nitroglycerin  when  the 
patient has been symptom-free for 12–24 h. The only absolute con-
traindications to the use of nitrates are hypotension or the recent 
use  of  a  phosphodiesterase  type  5  (PDE-5)  inhibitor,  sildenafil  or 
vardenafil (within 24 h), or tadalafil (within 48 h). 
a-Adrenergic  Blockers  and  Other  Agents  Beta  blockers  are  the 
other  mainstay  of  anti-ischemic  treatment  because  they  reduce 
myocardial oxygen needs. They may be started by the intravenous 
route  in  patients  with  severe  ischemia  but  should  be  avoided  in 
the  presence  of  acute  or  severe  heart  failure,  low  cardiac  output, 
hypotension,  or  contraindications  (e.g.,  high-degree  atrioventric-
ular  block,  active  bronchospasm).  Ordinarily,  oral  beta  blockade 
targeted to a heart rate of 50–60 beats/min is recommended.

Heart  rate–slowing  calcium  channel  blockers,  e.g.,  verapamil 
or  diltiazem,  are  recommended  for  patients  who  have  persistent 
symptoms or ECG signs of ischemia after treatment with full-dose 
nitrates  and  beta  blockers  and  in  patients  with  contraindications 
to either class of these agents. Patients who have continuing severe

of  ezetimibe  10  mg  daily  and/or  a  PCSK9  inhibitor  (alirocumab, 
evolocumab) early after ACS have been shown to further reduce the 
LDL-C and prevent future cardiovascular events. 
ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY
Antithrombotic therapy consisting of antiplatelet and anticoag-
ulant drugs represents the second major cornerstone of treatment 
(Table 274-4). 
Antiplatelet Drugs (See Chap. 118) 
Initial treatment should begin 
with  the  cyclooxygenase  inhibitor  aspirin  with  a  dose  of  at  least 
162  mg  of  a  rapidly  acting  preparation  (oral  non-enteric-coated 

or  intravenous).  Lower  doses  (75–100  mg/d)  are  recommended 
thereafter since they maintain efficacy while causing less bleeding. 
Contraindications are severe active bleeding and aspirin allergy.

In the absence of a high risk for bleeding, patients with NSTE-
ACS,  irrespective  of  whether  an  invasive  or  conservative  strategy 
(see below) is selected, should also receive a platelet P2Y12 receptor 
blocker to inhibit platelet activation. There are now three oral and 
one intravenous P2Y12 inhibitors to choose from. The thienopyri-
dine  clopidogrel  is  an  inactive  prodrug  that  is  converted  into  an 
active  metabolite  that  causes  irreversible  blockade  of  the  platelet 
P2Y12 receptor. The loading dose of clopidogrel is 600 mg, whereas 
the maintenance dose is 75 mg daily. When clopidogrel is added to 
aspirin, so-called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), in patients with 
NSTE-ACS,  it  confers  a  20%  relative  reduction  in  cardiovascular 
death,  MI,  or  stroke,  compared  to  aspirin  alone  but  is  associated 
with a moderate (absolute 1%) increase in major bleeding.

Two  other  P2Y12  inhibitors  have  been  shown  to  be  superior  to 
clopidogrel  in  preventing  recurrent  cardiac  ischemic  events  but 
both increase bleeding. Prasugrel, also a thienopyridine, achieves a 
more rapid onset and higher level of irreversible platelet inhibition 
than clopidogrel. It has been approved for ACS patients following 
angiography when PCI is planned; it should be administered at a

loading  dose  of  60  mg  followed  by  10  mg/d.  Compared  to  clopi-
dogrel,  prasugrel  significantly  reduces  the  combined  risk  of  car-
diovascular  death,  MI,  stroke,  and  stent  thrombosis  but  increases 
bleeding. Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with prior stroke 
or transient ischemic attack or at high risk for bleeding.

Ticagrelor,  a  potent,  reversible  platelet  P2Y12  inhibitor,  reduces 
the risk of cardiovascular death, total mortality, or MI compared to 
clopidogrel across a broad spectrum of patients with ACS. After a 
loading dose of 180 mg, 90 mg bid is administered as maintenance. 
Like  prasugrel,  ticagrelor  increases  the  risk  of  bleeding.  Unlike 
prasugrel,  ticagrelor  demonstrated  benefit  whether  patients  were 
managed  conservatively  or  with  an  early  invasive  strategy  (see 
below). Some patients may develop dyspnea soon after administra-
tion,  although  the  symptoms  are  often  transient  and  infrequently   
serious.

Up to one-third of patients have an inadequate response to clop-
idogrel, and a substantial proportion of these cases are related to a 
genetic variant of the cytochrome P450 system involving the 2C19 
gene that leads to reduced conversion of clopidogrel into its active 
metabolite. Thus, alternate P2Y12 blockers (prasugrel or ticagrelor) 
should  be  considered  in  patients  with  NSTE-ACS  who  develop  a 
new coronary event while receiving clopidogrel and aspirin.

DAPT  should  continue  for  at  least  3  months  (preferably 
12  months)  in  patients  with  NSTE-ACS  without  an  indication 
for  long-term  full-dose  anticoagulation;  the  duration  of  DAPT  is 
dependent upon the risk of bleeding versus thrombosis. Clinicians 
should select the antiplatelet regimen that provides the best balance 
of efficacy and safety based on the individual patient characteristics 
and clinical scenario. Longer duration DAPT is favored in patients

with  high  atherothrombotic  risk  (e.g.,  due  to  stenting  of  the  left 
main  coronary  artery  or  proximal  left  anterior  descending  or   
proximal  bifurcating  coronary  arteries,  recurrent  MI,  stent 
thrombosis).

An intravenous, direct, and rapidly acting P2Y12 inhibitor, can-
grelor, has also shown benefit relative to clopidogrel in patients who 
underwent PCI following a NSTE-ACS and reduced the risk of the 
primary  composite  outcome  of  death,  MI,  stent  thrombosis,  and 
ischemia-driven  revascularization  but  at  the  expense  of  increased 
major  bleeding  events.  This  drug  is  approved  as  an  adjunct  to 
PCI  for  reducing  the  risk  of  periprocedural  MI,  repeat  coronary 
revascularization,  and  stent  thrombosis  in  patients  who  have  not 
been treated with an oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor or an intravenous 
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, several trials of glycoprotein IIb/
IIIa inhibitors in patients with NSTE-ACS had shown modest ben-
efit  counterbalanced  by  an  increase  in  major  bleeding.  However, 
the majority of earlier studies were performed without concomitant 
P2Y12  inhibitor  treatment,  and  more  recent  studies  in  patients 
receiving the latter failed to show a benefit of routine early initiation 
of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Because of the increased risk of 

HPIM21e_Part6_p1797-p2130.indd   2050

21/01/22   6:25 PM

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systembleeding, the addition of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor to aspirin 
and  a  P2Y12  inhibitor  (i.e.,  triple  antiplatelet  therapy)  should  be 
reserved for unstable patients undergoing PCI (e.g., recurrent ische-
mia on DAPT, or high coronary thrombus burden on angiography) 
because of the increased risk of bleeding. 
Anticoagulants (See Chap. 118)  Four parenteral options are avail-
able  for  anticoagulant  therapy  to  be  added  to  antiplatelet  agents:   
(1)  unfractionated  heparin  (UFH),  long  the  mainstay  of  therapy;   
(2) the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin, which 
has been shown to be superior to UFH in reducing recurrent car-
diac events, especially in patients managed by a conservative strat-
egy  (however,  it  is  accompanied  by  a  slight  increase  in  bleeding); 
(3) bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor that is similar in efficacy 
to either UFH or LMWH and is used just prior to and/or during 
PCI;  and  (4)  fondaparinux,  a  synthetic  factor  Xa  inhibitor  that  is 
equivalent in efficacy to enoxaparin but has a lower risk of major 
bleeding.  While  UFH  and  enoxaparin  have  been  widely  studied 
in  patients  managed  either  with  an  early  conservative  or  invasive 
strategy,  bivalirudin  is  rarely  used  in  conservatively  managed 
patients, while fondaparinux requires supplemental UFH to prevent 
procedure-related thrombosis. In patients who develop NSTE-ACS 
while receiving treatment with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), 
the DOAC should be held when one of the four parenteral antico-
agulants is begun.

If an early invasive strategy is indicated (see below), radial arte-
rial access is recommended to reduce the risk of bleeding. Excessive 
bleeding  is  the  most  important  adverse  effect  of  all  antithrom-
botic agents, including both antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. 
Therefore, attention must be directed to the doses of antithrombotic 
agents, accounting for age, body weight, creatinine clearance, and 
a previous history of excessive bleeding. Patients who have experi-
enced a stroke are at higher risk of intracranial bleeding with potent 

antiplatelet  agents  and  combinations  of  antithrombotic  drugs.  In 
patients with atrial fibrillation (including patients with NSTE-ACS) 
treated with an oral anticoagulant who undergo PCI, the duration 
of DAPT should be shortened (e.g., stop aspirin after hospital dis-
charge or up to 4 weeks post PCI, except in patients at very high risk 
for ischemic events), and continue P2Y12 inhibitor plus DOAC for 
1 year. After 1 year, the majority of patients should be transitioned 
to  oral  anticoagulation  monotherapy  without  concomitant  anti-
platelet treatment. 
INVASIVE VERSUS CONSERVATIVE STRATEGY (FIG. 274-4)
In  an  invasive  strategy,  following  initiation  of  anti-ischemic  and 
antithrombotic agents as described above, coronary arteriography 
is  carried  out  within  ~48  h  of  presentation,  followed  by  coro-
nary  revascularization  (PCI  or  coronary  artery  bypass  grafting), 
depending on the coronary anatomy (Fig. 274-4). Multiple clinical 
trials  have  demonstrated  the  benefit  of  this  strategy  in  high-risk 
patients (i.e., patients with multiple clinical risk factors, ST-segment 
deviation, and/or positive biomarkers). Two studies comparing an 
immediate  invasive  strategy  (median  time  to  intervention  of  1.4 
and 4.7 h after presentation) reduced the rate of death or new MI 
compared to a delayed invasive strategy (median time of interven-
tion  of  61  and  62  h),  with  a  greater  benefit  among  patients  with 
a  high-risk  score.  In  patients  at  low  risk,  the  outcomes  from  an 
invasive strategy are similar to those obtained from a conservative 
strategy.  The  latter  consists  of  anti-ischemic  and  antithrombotic 
therapy  followed  by  a  “selective  invasive  approach,”  in  which  the 
patient  is  observed  closely  and  coronary  arteriography  is  carried 
out if coronary computed angiography shows the presence of epi-
cardial  coronary  stenosis,  rest  pain  or  ST-segment  changes  recur, 
a  biomarker  of  necrosis  becomes  positive,  or  there  is  evidence  of 
severe ischemia on a stress test.

 ■ LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT
The time of hospital discharge is a “teachable moment” for the patient 
with  NSTE-ACS,  when  the  caregiver  can  review  and  optimize  the 
medical regimen. Risk factor modification is key, and the importance 
of  smoking  cessation,  following  an  appropriate  diet,  achieving  and 
maintaining optimal weight, daily exercise, blood pressure control, and 
control of hyperglycemia (in diabetic patients) should be emphasized. 
There is evidence of benefit with long-term therapy with several classes 
of drugs. Beta blockers, intensive lipid-lowering therapies to achieve an 
LDL-C  <55  mg/dL,  ACE  inhibitors  or  angiotensin  receptor  blockers, 
and sodium-glucose co transport-2 or glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists 
in selected patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see Chap. 404), are 
recommended. The recommended antiplatelet regimen consists of the 
combination of low-dose (75–100 mg/d) aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor 
(clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for 12 months, unless there is a 
high risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet monotherapy should be continued 
thereafter,  unless  long-term  full-dose  anticoagulation  is  indicated,  in 
which case anticoagulant without antiplatelet therapy is recommended 
after  1  year  (see  above).  A  recent  trial  in  patients  (the  majority  after 
NSTE-ACS) who had received DAPT for 3 months after PCI and were 
then  randomized  to  aspirin  versus  placebo  on  a  background  of  con-
tinued  ticagrelor  for  12  months  showed  that  ticagrelor  monotherapy 
reduced  clinically  relevant  bleeding  without  an  increase  in  ischemic 
events compared to continuation of DAPT. In selected patients at high 
ischemic  risk  (e.g.,  those  with  prior  MI,  diabetes  mellitus,  coronary 
vein graft, heart failure) who are also at low risk of bleeding and not 
on an anticoagulant, continuation of DAPT to 3 years has been shown 
to be beneficial. Addition of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily to DAPT 
reduced MI, stent thrombosis, and cardiovascular death, while major 
bleeding was increased; however, the net outcome of fatal or irrevers-
ible events was reduced with the addition of the low-dose anti–factor 
Xa inhibitor.

Registries have shown that women and racial minorities, as well as 
patients with NSTE-ACS at high risk, including the elderly and patients 
with  diabetes  or  chronic  kidney  disease,  are  less  likely  to  receive  
evidence-based pharmacologic and interventional therapies with resul-
tant  poorer  clinical  outcomes  and  quality  of  life.  Special  attention 
should be directed to these groups.

 ■ PRINZMETAL’S VARIANT ANGINA
In  1959,  Prinzmetal  and  colleagues  described  a  syndrome  of  severe 
ischemic  pain  that  usually  occurs  at  rest  and  is  associated  with  ST- 
segment  elevation.  Prinzmetal’s  variant  angina  (PVA)  is  caused  by 
focal spasm of an epicardial coronary artery with resultant transmural 
ischemia and abnormalities in left ventricular function that may lead 
to acute MI, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and sudden cardiac 
death. The cause of the spasm is not well defined, but it may be related 
to hypercontractility of coronary arterial smooth muscle due to adren-
ergic vasoconstrictors, leukotrienes, or serotonin. For reasons that are 
not clear, the prevalence of PVA has decreased substantially during the 
past  few  decades,  although  it  remains  much  more  frequent  in  Japan 
than in North America or Western Europe.

Clinical and Angiographic Manifestations  Patients with PVA 
are  generally  younger  and,  with  the  exception  of  cigarette  smoking, 
have fewer coronary risk factors than do patients with NSTE-ACS. Car-
diac examination is usually unremarkable in the absence of ischemia. 
However, a minority of patients have a generalized vasospastic disorder 
associated with migraine and/or Raynaud’s phenomenon. The clinical 
diagnosis of PVA is made by the detection of transient ST-segment ele-
vation with rest pain, although many patients may also exhibit episodes 
of silent ischemia.

Coronary  angiography  demonstrates  transient  coronary  spasm 
as  the  diagnostic  hallmark  of  PVA.  Atherosclerotic  plaques  in  at 
least  one  proximal  coronary  artery  occur  in  about  half  of  patients. 
Hyperventilation  and  intracoronary  acetylcholine  have  been  used  to 
provoke  focal  coronary  stenosis  on  angiography  or  to  provoke  rest 
angina with ST-segment elevation to establish the diagnosis. In patients 
with no obstructive coronary atherosclerosis and suspected coronary 

vasomotor  abnormalities,  a  positive  provocative  test  for  spasm  has 
been shown to be safe, identifies a high-risk subgroup, and is endorsed 
by guidelines since it permits selection of therapy most appropriate for 
the underlying pathophysiology.

TREATMENT
Prinzmetal’s Variant Angina

Nitrates  and  calcium  channel  blockers  are  the  main  therapeutic 
agents.  Aspirin  may  actually  increase  the  severity  of  ischemic 
episodes, possibly as a result of the sensitivity of coronary tone to 
modest changes in the synthesis of prostacyclin. Statin therapy has 
been shown to reduce the risk of major adverse events, although the 
precise mechanism is not established. The response to beta blockers 
is  variable.  Coronary  revascularization  may  be  helpful  in  patients 
who  also  have  discrete,  flow-limiting,  proximal  fixed  obstructive 
lesions.  Patients  who  have  had  ischemia-associated  ventricular 
fibrillation  despite  maximal  medical  therapy  should  receive  an 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

Prognosis  Many  patients  with  PVA  pass  through  an  acute,  active 
phase, with frequent episodes of angina and cardiac events during the 
first 6 months after presentation, after which there may be a tendency 
for  symptoms  and  cardiac  events  to  diminish  over  time.  Survival  at  
5 years is excellent (~90–95%), but as many as 20% of patients experi-
ence an MI. Patients with no or mild fixed coronary obstruction expe-
rience a lower incidence of cardiac death or MI compared to patients 
with  associated  severe  obstructive  lesions.  Patients  with  PVA  who 
develop serious arrhythmias during spontaneous episodes of pain are at 
a higher risk for sudden cardiac death. In most patients who survive an 
infarction or the initial 3- to 6-month period of frequent episodes, there 
is a tendency for symptoms and cardiac events to diminish over time.
 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Ischemic heart disease (IHD), and its most dangerous manifestation, 
ACS, remains the most frequent cause of death and disability world-
wide. In the mid-twentieth century, these conditions were most com-
mon in high-income countries. The elucidation of risk factors leading 
to IHD, their management, and the development of therapies to reduce 
the  deleterious  consequences  of  ACS  were  responsible  for  dramatic 
reductions in these events that result in cardiovascular mortality. How-
ever, these advances have not affected all population groups equally. In 
Europe, there remains a northeast to southwest gradient, with higher 
prevalence in northern Russia and the Baltic nations and considerably 
lower  prevalence  in  France,  Italy,  and  Spain.  In  the  United  States, 
there remain racial and economic disparities, with poorer outcomes in 
minorities and low-income populations.

Simultaneous  with  these  important  advances  in  the  high-income 
countries,  the  low-  and  middle-income  countries  have  moved  in  the 
opposite  direction.  The  improvements  in  agriculture,  nutrition,  san-
itation,  prevention  and  treatment  of  infections,  and  management  of 
maternal/early childhood disorders, urbanization, and a reduction of 
physical  labor  have,  in  combination,  led  to  marked  increases  in  cor-
onary risk factors—hypertension, cigarette smoking, obesity, diabetes 
mellitus,  and  elevations  of  circulating  LDL-C.  These,  in  turn,  have 
been  responsible  for  marked  increases  in  ACS  events  and  cardiovas-
cular  mortality.  These  changes  have  been  most  prominent  in  central 
Asia, India, and Pakistan, as well as in the more developed regions of 
sub-Saharan Africa.

The current challenge is to apply what was learned in high-income 
countries  to  the  large  populations  in  the  low-  and  middle-income 
countries that are now at high risk. This will require large educational 
efforts directed at both the populations and their caregivers. An addi-
tional  challenge  will  be  to  provide  the  trained  specialized  personnel, 
facilities,  drugs,  and  devices  to  deal  with  these  threats.  The  success-
ful  implementation  of  these  measures  is  now  principally  a  socio- 
politico-economic  issue.  One  mitigating  factor  is  that  many  of  the 
important drugs to prevent and treat these disorders, such as statins,

275 ST-Segment Elevation 
Myocardial Infarction
Elliott M. Antman, Joseph Loscalzo

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common diagnosis in hospital-
ized patients in industrialized countries. In the United States, ~605,000 
patients  experience  a  new  AMI,  and  200,000  experience  a  recurrent 
AMI  each  year.  About  half  of  AMI-related  deaths  occur  before  the 
stricken individual reaches the hospital. Of note, the in-hospital mor-
tality rate after admission for AMI has declined from 10 to ~5%. The 
1-year  mortality  rate  after  AMI  is  ~15%.  Mortality  is  approximately 
fourfold  higher  in  elderly  patients  (aged  >75)  as  compared  with 
younger patients.

When patients with prolonged ischemic discomfort at rest are first 
seen, the working clinical diagnosis is that they are suffering from an 
acute coronary syndrome (Fig. 275-1). The 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG) is a pivotal diagnostic and triage tool because it is at the center 
of  the  decision  pathway  for  management,  permitting  distinction  of 
those  patients  presenting  with  ST-segment  elevation  from  those  pre-
senting without ST-segment elevation. Serum cardiac biomarkers are 
obtained  to  distinguish  unstable  angina  (UA)  from  non-ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and to assess the magnitude 
of an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Epidemio-
logic studies indicate there has been a shift in the pattern of AMI over 
the past several decades with more patients with NSTEMI than STEMI. 
This  chapter  focuses  on  the  evaluation  and  management  of  patients 
with STEMI, while Chap. 274 discusses UA/NSTEMI.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: ROLE OF ACUTE

STEMI  usually  occurs  when  coronary  blood  flow  decreases  abruptly 
after  a  thrombotic  occlusion  of  a  coronary  artery  previously  affected

FIGURE  275-1  Acute  coronary  syndromes.  Following  disruption  of  a  vulnerable 
plaque,  patients  experience  ischemic  discomfort  resulting  from  a  reduction  of 
flow  through  the  affected  epicardial  coronary  artery.  The  flow  reduction  may  be 
caused by a completely occlusive thrombus (right) or subtotally occlusive thrombus 
(left). Patients with ischemic discomfort may present with or without ST-segment 
elevation.  Of  patients  with  ST-segment  elevation,  the  majority  (wide  red  arrow) 
ultimately develop a Q wave on the ECG (Qw MI), while a minority (thin red arrow) 
do  not  develop  Q  wave  and,  in  older  literature,  were  said  to  have  sustained  a 
non-Q-wave  MI  (NQMI).  Patients  who  present  without  ST-segment  elevation  are 
suffering from either unstable angina or a non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) 
(wide green arrows), a distinction that is ultimately made based on the presence 
or  absence  of  a  serum  cardiac  biomarker  such  as  CK-MB  or  a  cardiac  troponin 
detected  in  the  blood.  The  majority  of  patients  presenting  with  NSTEMI  do  not 
develop a Q wave on the ECG; a minority develop a Qw MI (thin green arrow). Dx,

stenoses  do  not  typically  precipitate  STEMI  because  of  the  develop-
ment  of  a  rich  collateral  network  over  time.  Instead,  STEMI  occurs 
when a coronary artery thrombus develops rapidly at a site of vascular 
injury.  This  injury  is  produced  or  facilitated  by  factors  such  as  ciga-
rette  smoking,  hypertension,  and  lipid  accumulation.  In  most  cases, 
STEMI occurs when the surface of an atherosclerotic plaque becomes 
disrupted (exposing its contents to the blood) and conditions (local or 
systemic) favor thrombogenesis. A mural thrombus forms at the site of 
plaque disruption, and the involved coronary artery becomes occluded. 
Histologic studies indicate that the coronary plaques prone to disrup-
tion  are  those  with  a  rich  lipid  core  and  a  thin  fibrous  cap.  After  an 
initial platelet monolayer forms at the site of the disrupted plaque, var-
ious agonists (collagen, ADP, epinephrine, serotonin) promote platelet 
activation.  After  agonist  stimulation  of  platelets,  thromboxane  A2  (a 
potent  local  vasoconstrictor)  is  released,  further  platelet  activation 
occurs, and potential resistance to fibrinolysis develops.

In addition to the generation of thromboxane A2, activation of plate-
lets by agonists promotes a conformational change in the glycoprotein 
IIb/IIIa receptor (Chap. 115). Once converted to its functional state, 
this receptor develops a high affinity for soluble adhesive proteins (i.e., 
integrins) such as fibrinogen. Since fibrinogen is a multivalent mole-
cule, it can bind to two different platelets simultaneously, resulting in 
platelet cross-linking and aggregation.

The  coagulation  cascade  is  activated  on  exposure  of  tissue  factor 
in damaged endothelial cells at the site of the disrupted plaque. Fac-
tors  VII  and  X  are  activated,  ultimately  leading  to  the  conversion  of 
prothrombin  to  thrombin,  which  then  converts  fibrinogen  to  fibrin 
(Chap. 116).  Fluid-phase  and  clot-bound  thrombin  participate  in  an 
autoamplification reaction leading to further activation of the coagula-
tion cascade. The culprit coronary artery eventually becomes occluded 
by  a  thrombus  containing  platelet  aggregates  and  fibrin  strands  
(Fig. 275-2).

In  rare  cases,  STEMI  may  be  due  to  coronary  artery  occlusion 
caused by coronary emboli, congenital abnormalities, coronary spasm, 
and a wide variety of systemic—particularly inflammatory—diseases.

FIGURE 275-2  Critical determinants of myocardial infarction injury. The overlapping 
of vulnerable plaque and thrombogenic blood are critical determinants for myocardial 
infarction occurrence and extension. In addition, myocardial vulnerability, which is 
largely  due  to  coronary  microvascular  dysfunction,  contributes  to  extension  and 
severity of ischemic injury. In the most severe form (known as no-reflow), structural 
and  functional  impairments  sustain  vascular  obstruction.  Endothelial  dysfunction 
triggers  leukocyte  and  platelet  activation/interaction,  whereas  thrombotic  debris 
may  worsen  the  obstruction.  Furthermore,  cardiomyocyte  swelling,  interstitial 
edema,  and  tissue  inflammation  promote  extravascular  compression.  (Modified 
from  F  Montecucco,  F  Carbone,  TH  Schindler.  Pathophysiology  of  ST-segment 
elevation  myocardial  infarction:  Novel  mechanisms  and  treatments.  Eur  Heart  J 
37:1268, 2016.)

The  amount  of  myocardial  damage  caused  by  coronary  occlusion 
depends on (1) the territory supplied by the affected vessel, (2) whether 
or not the vessel becomes totally occluded, (3) the duration of coronary 
occlusion, (4) the quantity of blood supplied by collateral vessels to the 
affected tissue, (5) the demand for oxygen of the myocardium whose 
blood supply has been suddenly limited, (6) endogenous factors that 
can produce early spontaneous lysis of the occlusive thrombus, and (7) 
the adequacy of myocardial perfusion in the infarct zone when flow is 
restored in the occluded epicardial coronary artery.

Patients at increased risk for developing STEMI include those with 
multiple  coronary  risk  factors  and  those  with  UA  (Chap.  274).  Less 
common underlying medical conditions predisposing patients to STEMI 
include hypercoagulability, collagen vascular disease, cocaine abuse, and 
intracardiac thrombi or masses that produce coronary emboli.

There have been major advances in the management of STEMI with 
recognition  that  the  “chain  of  survival”  involves  a  highly  integrated 
system  starting  with  prehospital  care  and  extending  to  early  hospital 
management so as to provide expeditious implementation of a reper-
fusion strategy.

time of the day or night, circadian variations have been reported such 
that clusters are seen in the morning within a few hours of awakening.
Pain  is  the  most  common  presenting  complaint  in  patients  with 
STEMI.  The  pain  is  deep  and  visceral;  adjectives  commonly  used  to 
describe  it  are  heavy,  squeezing,  and  crushing;  although,  occasionally, 
it is described as stabbing or burning (Chap. 14). It is similar in char-
acter to the discomfort of angina pectoris (Chap. 273) but commonly 
occurs  at  rest,  is  usually  more  severe,  and  lasts  longer.  Typically,  the 
pain involves the central portion of the chest and/or the epigastrium, 
and, on occasion, it radiates to the arms. Less common sites of radi-
ation  include  the  abdomen,  back,  lower  jaw,  and  neck.  The  frequent 
location  of  the  pain  beneath  the  xiphoid  and  epigastrium  and  the 
patients’  denial  that  they  may  be  suffering  a  heart  attack  are  chiefly 
responsible for the common mistaken impression of indigestion. The 
pain of STEMI may radiate as high as the occipital area but not below 
the umbilicus. It is often accompanied by weakness, sweating, nausea, 
vomiting, anxiety, and a sense of impending doom. The pain may com-
mence when the patient is at rest, but when it begins during a period 
of  exertion,  it  does  not  usually  subside  with  cessation  of  activity,  in 
contrast to angina pectoris.

The  pain  of  STEMI  can  simulate  pain  from  acute  pericarditis  
(Chap. 270), pulmonary embolism (Chap. 279), acute aortic dissection 
(Chap.  280),  costochondritis,  and  gastrointestinal  disorders.  These 
conditions should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis. 
Radiation  of  discomfort  to  the  trapezius  is  not  seen  in  patients  with 
STEMI and may be a useful distinguishing feature that suggests peri-
carditis is the correct diagnosis. However, pain is not uniformly present 
in patients with STEMI. The proportion of painless STEMIs is greater 
in  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus,  and  it  increases  with  age.  In  the 
elderly, STEMI may present as sudden-onset breathlessness, which may 
progress to pulmonary edema. Other less common presentations, with 
or  without  pain,  include  sudden  loss  of  consciousness,  a  confusional 
state, a sensation of profound weakness, the appearance of an arrhyth-
mia, evidence of peripheral embolism, or merely an unexplained drop 
in arterial pressure.

 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
Most  patients  are  anxious  and  restless,  attempting  unsuccessfully  to 
relieve  the  pain  by  moving  about  in  bed,  altering  their  position,  and 
stretching.  Pallor  associated  with  perspiration  and  coolness  of  the 
extremities  occurs  commonly.  The  combination  of  substernal  chest 
pain persisting for >30 min and diaphoresis strongly suggests STEMI. 
Although many patients have a normal pulse rate and blood pressure 
within the first hour of STEMI, patients with anterior infarction may 
have  manifestations  of  sympathetic  nervous  system  hyperactivity 
(tachycardia and/or hypertension), and those with inferior infarction 
may  show  evidence  of  parasympathetic  hyperactivity  (bradycardia 
and/or hypotension).

The  precordium  is  usually  quiet,  and  the  apical  impulse  may 
be  difficult  to  palpate.  In  patients  with  anterior  wall  infarction,  an 
abnormal systolic pulsation caused by dyskinetic bulging of infarcted 
myocardium may develop in the periapical area within the first days 
of the illness and then may resolve. Other physical signs of ventricular 
dysfunction include fourth and third heart sounds, decreased intensity 
of the first heart sound, and paradoxical splitting of the second heart 
sound (Chap. 239). A transient midsystolic or late systolic apical sys-
tolic  murmur  due  to  dysfunction  of  the  mitral  valve  apparatus  may 
be  present.  A  pericardial  friction  rub  may  be  heard  in  patients  with 
transmural STEMI at some time in the course of the illness, if they are 
examined frequently. The carotid pulse is often decreased in volume, 
reflecting reduced stroke volume. Temperature elevations up to 38°C 
may be observed during the first week after STEMI. The arterial pres-
sure  is  variable;  in  most  patients  with  transmural  infarction,  systolic 
pressure declines by ~10–15 mmHg from the preinfarction state.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
In up to one-half of cases, a precipitating factor appears to be present 
before STEMI, such as vigorous physical exercise, emotional stress, or 
a medical or surgical illness. Although STEMI may commence at any 

LABORATORY FINDINGS
STEMI progresses through the following temporal stages: (1) acute (first

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemzone,  beginning  with  recruitment  of  polymorphonuclear  leukocytes 
(for  removal  of  dead  cells  and  clearance  of  extracellular  macromole-
cules)  followed  by  proinflammatory  monocytes  (that  recruit  fibrob-
lasts) and ultimately reparative monocytes (that promote angiogenesis 
and interstitial collagen production).

When evaluating the results of diagnostic tests for STEMI, the tem-
poral phase of the infarction must be considered. The laboratory tests 
of value in confirming the diagnosis may be divided into four groups: 
(1) ECG, (2) serum cardiac biomarkers, (3) cardiac imaging, and (4) 
nonspecific indices of tissue necrosis and inflammation.

 ■ ELECTROCARDIOGRAM
The  electrocardiographic  manifestations  of  STEMI  are  described  in 
Chap.  240.  During  the  initial  stage,  total  occlusion  of  an  epicardial 
coronary artery produces ST-segment elevation. Most patients initially 
presenting  with  ST-segment  elevation  ultimately  evolve  Q  waves  on 
the  ECG.  However,  Q  waves  in  the  leads  overlying  the  infarct  zone 
may vary in magnitude and appear only transiently, depending on the 
reperfusion status of the ischemic myocardium and restoration of trans-
membrane potentials over time. A small proportion of patients initially 
presenting with ST-segment elevation will not develop Q waves when 
the obstructing thrombus is not totally occlusive, obstruction is tran-
sient, or a rich collateral network is present. Among patients presenting 
with ischemic discomfort but without ST-segment elevation, if a serum 
cardiac biomarker of necrosis (see below) is detected, the diagnosis of 
NSTEMI is ultimately made (Fig. 275-1). A minority of patients who 
present initially without ST-segment elevation may develop a Q-wave 
myocardial infarction (MI). Previously, it was believed that transmural 
MI is present if the ECG demonstrates Q waves or loss of R waves, and 
nontransmural  MI  may  be  present  if  the  ECG  shows  only  transient 
ST-segment  and  T-wave  changes.  However,  electrocardiographic-
pathologic correlations are far from perfect, and terms such as Q-wave 
MI, non-Q-wave MI, transmural MI, and nontransmural MI have been 
replaced by STEMI and NSTEMI (Fig. 275-1). Contemporary studies 
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggest that the development 
of a Q wave on the ECG is more dependent on the volume of infarcted 
tissue rather than the transmurality of infarction.

 ■ SERUM CARDIAC BIOMARKERS
Certain proteins, referred to as serum cardiac biomarkers, are released 
from necrotic heart muscle after STEMI. The rate of liberation of spe-
cific  proteins  differs  depending  on  their  intracellular  location,  their 
molecular  weight,  and  the  local  blood  and  lymphatic  flow.  Cardiac 
biomarkers become detectable in the peripheral blood once the capac-
ity  of  the  cardiac  lymphatics  to  clear  the  interstitium  of  the  infarct 
zone is exceeded and spillover into the venous circulation occurs. The 
temporal  pattern  of  protein  release  is  of  diagnostic  importance.  The 
criteria for AMI require a rise and/or fall in cardiac biomarker values 
with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference 
limit for normal individuals.

Cardiac-specific  troponin  T  (cTnT)  and  cardiac-specific  troponin  I 
(cTnI) have amino-acid sequences that differ from those of the skeletal 
muscle forms of these proteins. These differences permitted the devel-
opment of quantitative assays for cTnT and cTnI using highly specific 
monoclonal  antibodies.  cTnT  and  cTnI  may  increase  after  STEMI  to 
levels  many  times  higher  than  the  upper  reference  limit  (the  highest 
value  seen  in  99%  of  a  reference  population  not  suffering  from  MI), 
the  measurement  of  cTnT  or  cTnI  is  of  considerable  diagnostic  use-
fulness,  and  they  are  now  the  preferred  biochemical  markers  for  MI  
(Fig. 275-3). With improvements in the assays for the cardiac-specific 
troponins,  it  is  now  possible  to  detect  concentrations  <1  ng/L  in 
patients without ischemic-type chest discomfort. The cardiac tropon-
ins are particularly valuable when there is clinical suspicion of either 
skeletal muscle injury or a small MI that may be below the detection 
limit  for  creatine  phosphokinase  (CK)  and  its  MB  isoenzyme  (CK-
MB), and they are, therefore, of particular value in distinguishing UA 
from NSTEMI. In practical terms, the high-sensitivity troponin assays 
are  of  less  immediate  value  in  patients  with  STEMI.  Contemporary 
urgent  reperfusion  strategies  necessitate  making  a  decision  (based

Days after onset of AMI

FIGURE 275-3  The zone of necrosing myocardium is shown at the top of the figure, 
followed in the middle portion of the figure by a diagram of a cardiomyocyte that 
is  in  the  process  of  releasing  biomarkers.  The  biomarkers  that  are  released  into 
the interstitium are first cleared by lymphatics followed subsequently by spillover 
into  the  venous  system.  After  disruption  of  the  sarcolemmal  membrane  of  the 
cardiomyocyte, the cytoplasmic pool of biomarkers is released first (left-most arrow 
in bottom portion of figure). Markers such as myoglobin and CK isoforms are rapidly 
released, and blood levels rise quickly above the cutoff limit; this is then followed 
by a more protracted release of biomarkers from the disintegrating myofilaments 
that  may  continue  for  several  days.  Cardiac  troponin  levels  rise  to  about  20–50 
times the upper reference limit (the 99th percentile of values in a reference control 
group)  in  patients  who  have  a  “classic”  acute  myocardial  infarction  (MI)  and 
sustain sufficient myocardial necrosis to result in abnormally elevated levels of the 
MB fraction of creatine kinase (CK-MB). Clinicians can now diagnose episodes of 
microinfarction by sensitive assays that detect cardiac troponin elevations above 
the  upper  reference  limit,  even  though  CK-MB  levels  may  still  be  in  the  normal 
reference  range  (not  shown).  CV,  coefficient  of  variation.  (Modified  from  EM

2056 largely  on  a  combination  of  clinical  and  ECG  findings)  before  the 
results of blood tests have returned from the laboratory. Levels of cTnI 
and cTnT may remain elevated for 7–10 days after STEMI.

CK rises within 4–8 h and generally returns to normal by 48–72 h 
(Fig. 275-3). An important drawback of total CK measurement is its 
lack  of  specificity  for  STEMI,  as  CK  may  be  elevated  with  skeletal 
muscle disease or trauma, including intramuscular injection. The MB 
isoenzyme of CK has the advantage over total CK that it is not present 
in  significant  concentrations  in  extracardiac  tissue  and,  therefore,  is 
considerably more specific. However, cardiac surgery, myocarditis, and 
electrical cardioversion often result in elevated serum levels of the MB 
isoenzyme. A ratio (relative index) of CK-MB mass to CK activity ≥2.5 
suggests  but  is  not  diagnostic  of  a  myocardial  rather  than  a  skeletal 
muscle source for the CK-MB elevation.

Many hospitals are using cTnT or cTnI rather than CK-MB as the 
routine  serum  cardiac  marker  for  diagnosis  of  STEMI,  although  any 
of these analytes remains clinically acceptable. It is not cost-effective to 
measure both a cardiac-specific troponin and CK-MB at all time points 
in every patient.

While it has long been recognized that the total quantity of protein 
released  correlates  with  the  size  of  the  infarct,  the  peak  protein  con-
centration  correlates  only  weakly  with  infarct  size.  Recanalization  of 
a  coronary  artery  occlusion  (either  spontaneously  or  by  mechanical 
or pharmacologic means) in the early hours of STEMI causes earlier 
peaking  of  biomarker  measurements  (Fig.  275-3)  because  of  a  rapid 
washout from the interstitium of the infarct zone, quickly overwhelm-
ing lymphatic clearance of the proteins.

The  nonspecific  reaction  to  myocardial  injury  is  associated  with 
polymorphonuclear  leukocytosis,  which  appears  within  a  few  hours 
after  the  onset  of  pain  and  persists  for  3–7  days;  the  white  blood 
cell  count  often  reaches  levels  of  12,000–15,000/μL.  The  erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate rises more slowly than the white blood cell count, 
peaking during the first week and sometimes remaining elevated for 1 
or 2 weeks.

 ■ CARDIAC IMAGING
Abnormalities  of  wall  motion  on  two-dimensional  echocardiography 
(Chap.  241)  are  almost  universally  present.  Although  acute  STEMI 
cannot  be  distinguished  from  an  old  myocardial  scar  or  from  acute 
severe ischemia by echocardiography, the ease and safety of the pro-
cedure  make  its  use  appealing  as  a  screening  tool  in  the  emergency 
department setting. When the ECG is not diagnostic of STEMI, early 
detection of the presence or absence of wall motion abnormalities by 
echocardiography can aid in management decisions, such as whether 
the  patient  should  receive  reperfusion  therapy  (e.g.,  fibrinolysis  or  a 
percutaneous  coronary  intervention  [PCI]).  Echocardiographic  esti-
mation of left ventricular (LV) function is useful prognostically; detec-
tion  of  reduced  function  serves  as  an  indication  for  therapy  with  an 
inhibitor  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system.  Echocardiog-
raphy may also identify the presence of right ventricular (RV) infarc-
tion,  ventricular  aneurysm,  pericardial  effusion,  and  LV  thrombus. 
In addition, Doppler echocardiography is useful in the detection and 
quantitation of a ventricular septal defect and mitral regurgitation, two 
serious complications of STEMI.

Several  radionuclide  imaging  techniques  (Chap.  241)  are  available 
for evaluating patients with suspected STEMI. However, these imaging 
modalities are used less often than echocardiography because they are 
more cumbersome and lack sensitivity and specificity in many clinical 
circumstances.  Myocardial  perfusion  imaging  with  [201Tl]  or  [99mTc]- 
sestamibi,  which  are  distributed  in  proportion  to  myocardial  blood 
flow  and  concentrated  by  viable  myocardium  (Chap.  273),  reveals  a 
defect  (“cold  spot”)  in  most  patients  during  the  first  few  hours  after 
development of a transmural infarct. Although perfusion scanning is 
extremely  sensitive,  it  cannot  distinguish  acute  infarcts  from  chronic 
scars and, thus, is not specific for the diagnosis of acute MI. Radionu-
clide ventriculography, carried out with [99mTc]-labeled red blood cells, 
frequently  demonstrates  wall  motion  disorders  and  reduction  in  the 
ventricular ejection fraction in patients with STEMI. While of value in 
assessing the hemodynamic consequences of infarction and in aiding 

in  the  diagnosis  of  RV  infarction  when  the  RV  ejection  fraction  is 
depressed, this technique is nonspecific, as many cardiac abnormalities 
other than MI alter the radionuclide ventriculogram.

MI  can  be  detected  accurately  with  high-resolution  cardiac  MRI 
(Chap.  241)  using  a  technique  referred  to  as  late  enhancement.  A 
standard imaging agent (gadolinium) is administered and images are 
obtained  after  a  10-min  delay.  Since  little  gadolinium  enters  normal 
myocardium, where there are tightly packed myocytes, but does per-
colate into the intercellular region of the infarct zone, there is a bright 
signal in areas of infarction that appears in stark contrast to the dark 
areas of normal myocardium.

An  Expert  Consensus  Task  Force  for  the  Universal  Definition  of 
Myocardial Infarction has provided a comprehensive set of criteria for 
the definition of MI that integrates the clinical and laboratory findings 
discussed  earlier  (Table  275-1)  as  well  as  a  classification  of  MI  into 
five types that reflect the clinical circumstances in which it may occur 
(Fig. 275-4).

INITIAL MANAGEMENT
 ■ PREHOSPITAL CARE
The  prognosis  in  STEMI  is  largely  related  to  the  occurrence  of  two 
general classes of complications: (1) electrical complications (arrhyth-
mias) and (2) mechanical complications (“pump failure”). Most out-of- 
hospital  deaths  from  STEMI  result  from  the  sudden  development  of 
ventricular fibrillation. The vast majority of deaths due to ventricular 
fibrillation occur within the first 24 h of the onset of symptoms, and of 
these, over half occur in the first hour. Therefore, the major elements 
of prehospital care of patients with suspected STEMI include (1) rec-
ognition  of  symptoms  by  the  patient  and  prompt  seeking  of  medical 
attention; (2) rapid deployment of an emergency medical team capa-
ble  of  performing  resuscitative  maneuvers,  including  defibrillation;  
(3) expeditious transportation of the patient to a hospital facility that 
is  continuously  staffed  by  physicians  and  nurses  skilled  in  manag-
ing  arrhythmias  and  providing  advanced  cardiac  life  support;  and  
(4)  expeditious  implementation  of  reperfusion  therapy.  The  greatest 
delay  usually  occurs  not  during  transportation  to  the  hospital  but, 
rather, between the onset of pain and the patient’s decision to call for 
help. This delay can best be reduced by health care professionals edu-
cating the public concerning the significance of chest discomfort and 
the importance of seeking early medical attention. Regular office visits 
with patients having a history of, or who are at risk for, ischemic heart 
disease are important “teachable moments” for clinicians to review the 
symptoms of STEMI and the appropriate action plan.

Increasingly,  monitoring  and  treatment  are  carried  out  by  trained 
personnel in the ambulance, further shortening the time between the 
onset  of  the  infarction  and  appropriate  treatment.  General  guidelines 
for initiation of fibrinolysis in the prehospital setting include the ability 
to transmit 12-lead ECGs to confirm the diagnosis, the presence of para-
medics in the ambulance, training of paramedics in the interpretation of 
ECGs and management of STEMI, and online medical command and 
control that can authorize the initiation of treatment in the field.

MANAGEMENT IN THE EMERGENCY 
DEPARTMENT
In  the  emergency  department,  the  goals  for  the  management  of 
patients with suspected STEMI include control of cardiac discomfort, 
rapid identification of patients who are candidates for urgent reperfu-
sion  therapy,  triage  of  lower-risk  patients  to  the  appropriate  location 
in  the  hospital,  and  avoidance  of  inappropriate  discharge  of  patients 
with STEMI. Many aspects of the treatment of STEMI are initiated in 
the emergency department and then continued during the in-hospital 
phase of management (Fig. 275-5). The overarching goal is to mini-
mize  the  time  from  first  medical  contact  to  initiation  of  reperfusion 
therapy. This may involve transfer from a non-PCI hospital to one that 
is  PCI  capable,  with  a  goal  of  initiating  PCI  within  120  min  of  first 
medical contact (Fig. 275-5).

Aspirin  is  essential  in  the  management  of  patients  with  suspected 
STEMI  and  is  effective  across  the  entire  spectrum  of  acute  coronary

TABLE 275-1  Definitions of Myocardial Injury and Infarction
Criteria for Myocardial Injury

The term myocardial injury should be used when there is evidence of elevated 
cardiac troponin (cTn) levels with at least one value above the 99th percentile 
upper reference limit (URL). The myocardial injury is considered acute if there is 
a rise and/or fall of cTn values.

Criteria for Acute Myocardial Infarction (types 1, 2, and 3 MI)

The term acute myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is acute 
myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia and with 
detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at least one value above the 99th 
percentile URL and at least one of the following:
•	 Symptoms of myocardial ischemia
•	 New ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes
•	 Development of pathologic Q waves
•	 Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall 
motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology

•	 Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for types 

2 or 3 MIs)

Postmortem demonstration of acute atherothrombosis in the artery supplying 
the infarcted myocardium meets criteria for type 1 MI. Evidence of an 
imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute 
atherothrombosis meets criteria for type 2 MI. Cardiac death in patients with 
symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic ECG 
changes before cTn values became available or abnormal meets criteria for  
type 3 MI.

Criteria for Coronary Procedure–Related MI (types 4 and 5 MI)

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)–related MI is termed type 4a MI.
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)–related MI is termed type 5 MI. 
Coronary procedure–related MI <48 h after the index procedure is arbitrarily 
defined by an elevation of cTn values >5 times for type 4a MI and >10 times for 
type 5 MI of the 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values. 
Patients with elevated preprocedural cTn values, in whom the preprocedural 
cTn levels are stable (<20% variation) or falling, must meet the criteria for a >5- 
or >10-fold increase and manifest a change from the baseline value of >20%. In 
addition, they must have at least one of the following:
•	 New ischemic ECG changes (this criterion is related to type 4a MI only)
•	 Development of new pathologic Q waves
•	 Imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium that is presumed to be new 

and in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology

•	 Angiographic findings consistent with a procedural flow-limiting complication 
such as coronary dissection, occlusion of a major epicardial artery or graft, 
side-branch occlusion-thrombus, disruption of collateral flow, or distal 
embolization

Isolated development of new pathologic Q waves meets the type 4a MI or type 5 
MI criteria with either revascularization procedure if cTn levels are elevated and 
rising, but less than the prespecified thresholds for PCI and CABG.
Other types of type 4 MI include type 4B MI stent thrombosis and type 4C MI 
restenosis that both meet type 1 MI criteria.
Postmortem demonstration of a procedure-related thrombus meets the type 4a 
MI and type 5 MI criteria if associated with a stent.

Criteria for Prior or Silent/Unrecognized MI

Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for prior or silent/
unrecognized MI:
•	 Abnormal Q waves with or without symptoms in the absence of nonischemic 

causes

•	 Imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium in a pattern consistent with 

ischemic etiology

•	 Pathoanatomical findings of a prior MI

syndromes (Fig. 275-5). Rapid inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 in plate-
lets followed by a reduction of thromboxane A2 levels is achieved by 
buccal  absorption  of  a  chewed  160–325-mg  tablet  in  the  emergency 
department. This measure should be followed by daily oral adminis-
tration of aspirin in a dose of 75–162 mg.

In  patients  whose  arterial  oxygen  (O2)  saturation  is  normal,  sup-
plemental  O2  is  of  limited  if  any  clinical  benefit  and  therefore  is  not 

cost-effective.  However,  when  hypoxemia  is  present,  O2  should  be 
administered  by  nasal  prongs  or  face  mask  (2–4  L/min)  for  the  first 
6–12 h after infarction; the patient should then be reassessed to deter-
mine if there is a continued need for such treatment.

CONTROL OF DISCOMFORT
Sublingual  nitroglycerin  can  be  given  safely  to  most  patients  with 
STEMI. Up to three doses of 0.4 mg should be administered at about 
5-min intervals. In addition to diminishing or abolishing chest discom-
fort, nitroglycerin may be capable of both decreasing myocardial oxygen 
demand (by lowering preload) and increasing myocardial oxygen supply 
(by  dilating  infarct-related  coronary  vessels  or  collateral  vessels).  In 
patients whose initially favorable response to sublingual nitroglycerin is 
followed by the return of chest discomfort, particularly if accompanied 
by other evidence of ongoing ischemia such as further ST-segment or 
T-wave shifts, the use of intravenous nitroglycerin should be consid-
ered. Therapy with nitrates should be avoided in patients who present 
with  low  systolic  arterial  pressure  (<90  mmHg)  or  in  whom  there  is 
clinical  suspicion  of  RV  infarction  (inferior  infarction  on  ECG,  ele-
vated jugular venous pressure, clear lungs, and hypotension). Nitrates 
should not be administered to patients who have taken a phosphodi-
esterase-5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction within the preceding 24 h, 
because it may potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates. An idio-
syncratic  reaction  to  nitrates,  consisting  of  sudden  marked  hypoten-
sion,  sometimes  occurs  but  can  usually  be  reversed  promptly  by  the 
rapid administration of intravenous atropine.

Morphine  is  a  very  effective  analgesic  for  the  pain  associated  with 
STEMI.  However,  it  may  reduce  sympathetically  mediated  arteriolar 
and venous constriction, and the resulting venous pooling may reduce 
cardiac output and arterial pressure. These hemodynamic disturbances 
usually respond promptly to elevation of the legs, but in some patients, 
volume  expansion  with  intravenous  saline  is  required.  The  patient 
may experience diaphoresis and nausea, but these events usually pass 
and are replaced by a feeling of well-being associated with the relief of 
pain. Morphine also has a vagotonic effect and may cause bradycardia 
or advanced degrees of heart block, particularly in patients with infe-
rior infarction. These side effects usually respond to atropine (0.5 mg 
intravenously). Morphine is routinely administered by repetitive (every  
5 min) intravenous injection of small doses (2–4 mg), rather than by 
the subcutaneous administration of a larger quantity, because absorp-
tion may be unpredictable by the latter route.

Intravenous beta blockers are also useful in the control of the pain of 
STEMI. These drugs control pain effectively in some patients, presum-
ably by diminishing myocardial O2 demand and hence ischemia. More 
important,  there  is  evidence  that  intravenous  beta  blockers  reduce  the 
risks of reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation (see “Beta-Adrenoceptor 
Blockers” below). A commonly employed regimen is metoprolol, 5 mg 
every 2–5 min for a total of three doses, provided the patient has a heart 
rate >60 beats/min, systolic pressure >100 mmHg, a PR interval <0.24 s, 
and rales that are no higher than 10 cm up from the diaphragm. Fifteen 
minutes after the last intravenous dose, an oral regimen is initiated of 
50 mg every 6 h for 48 h, followed by 100 mg every 12 h.

Patient  selection  is  important  when  considering  beta  blockers 
for  STEMI.  Oral  beta  blocker  therapy  should  be  initiated  in  the  first  
24  h  for  patients  who  do  not  have  any  of  the  following:  (1)  signs  of 
heart failure, (2) evidence of a low-output state, (3) increased risk for 
cardiogenic shock, or (4) other relative contraindications to beta block-
ade  (PR  interval  >0.24  s,  second-  or  third-degree  heart  block,  active 
asthma, or reactive airway disease).

Unlike  beta  blockers,  calcium  antagonists  are  of  little  value  in  the 
acute setting, and there is evidence that short-acting dihydropyridines 
may be associated with an increased mortality risk.

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
The primary tool for screening patients and making triage decisions is 
the initial 12-lead ECG. When ST-segment elevation of at least 2 mm in 
two contiguous precordial leads and 1 mm in two adjacent limb leads 
is present, a patient should be considered a candidate for reperfusion 
therapy (Figs. 275-1 and 275-5). The process of selecting patients for

fibrinolysis versus primary PCI (angioplasty or stenting; Chap. 276) is 
discussed  below.  In  the  absence  of  ST-segment  elevation,  fibrinolysis 
is not helpful, and evidence exists suggesting that it may be harmful.

LIMITATION OF INFARCT SIZE
The quantity of myocardium that becomes necrotic as a consequence of 
a coronary artery occlusion is determined by factors other than just the 
site of occlusion. While the central zone of the infarct contains necrotic 
tissue  that  is  irretrievably  lost,  the  fate  of  the  surrounding  ischemic 
myocardium  (ischemic  penumbra)  may  be  improved  by  timely  res-
toration of coronary perfusion, reduction of myocardial O2 demands, 
prevention of the accumulation of noxious metabolites, and blunting 
of the impact of mediators of reperfusion injury (e.g., calcium overload 
and  oxygen-derived  free  radicals).  Up  to  one-third  of  patients  with 
STEMI may achieve spontaneous reperfusion of the infarct-related cor-
onary artery within 24 h and experience improved healing of infarcted 
tissue.  Reperfusion,  either  pharmacologically  (by  fibrinolysis)  or  by 
PCI, accelerates the opening of infarct-related arteries in those patients 
in whom spontaneous fibrinolysis ultimately would have occurred and 
also greatly increases the number of patients in whom restoration of 
flow in the infarct-related artery is accomplished. Timely restoration of 
flow in the epicardial infarct–related artery combined with improved 
perfusion of the downstream zone of infarcted myocardium results in 
a limitation of infarct size. Protection of the ischemic myocardium by 
the maintenance of an optimal balance between myocardial O2 supply 
and demand through pain control, treatment of congestive heart failure 
(CHF),  and  minimization  of  tachycardia  and  hypertension  extends 
the  “window”  of  time  for  the  salvage  of  myocardium  by  reperfusion 
strategies.

Glucocorticoids  and  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  agents,  with 
the  exception  of  aspirin,  should  be  avoided  in  patients  with  STEMI. 
They  can  impair  infarct  healing  and  increase  the  risk  of  myocardial 
rupture, and their use may result in a larger infarct scar. In addition, 
they  can  increase  coronary  vascular  resistance,  thereby  potentially 
reducing flow to ischemic myocardium.

 ■ PRIMARY PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY 
INTERVENTION
(See also Chap. 276) PCI, usually angioplasty and/or stenting without 
preceding fibrinolysis, referred to as primary PCI, is effective in restor-
ing  perfusion  in  STEMI  when  carried  out  on  an  emergency  basis  in 
the first few hours of MI. It has the advantage of being applicable to 
patients who have contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy (see below) 
but  otherwise  are  considered  appropriate  candidates  for  reperfusion. 
It appears to be more effective than fibrinolysis in opening occluded 
coronary  arteries  and,  when  performed  by  experienced  operators  in 
dedicated  medical  centers,  is  associated  with  better  short-term  and 
long-term  clinical  outcomes.  Compared  with  fibrinolysis,  primary 
PCI is generally preferred when the diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic 
shock  is  present,  bleeding  risk  is  increased,  or  symptoms  have  been 
present for at least 2–3 h when the clot is more mature and less easily 
lysed by fibrinolytic drugs. However, PCI is expensive in terms of per-
sonnel and facilities, and its applicability is limited by its availability, 
around the clock, in only a minority of hospitals (Fig. 275-5). Whereas 
prior trials suggested that the only vessel upon which an intervention 
should be performed is the infarct-related artery, more contemporary 
studies  (PRAMI,  CvLPRIT,  COMPLETE)  provide  evidence  that  per-
forming PCI on nonculprit coronary vessels results in a lower rate of 
cardiovascular events and a lower need for subsequent ischemia-driven 
revascularization.

 ■ FIBRINOLYSIS
If  no  contraindications  are  present  (see  below),  fibrinolytic  therapy 
should ideally be initiated within 30 min of presentation (i.e., door-to-
needle time ≤30 min). The principal goal of fibrinolysis is prompt res-
toration of full coronary arterial patency. The fibrinolytic agents tissue 
plasminogen  activator  (tPA),  streptokinase,  tenecteplase  (TNK),  and 
reteplase (rPA) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration for intravenous use in patients with STEMI. These drugs all 

act  by  promoting  the  conversion  of  plasminogen  to  plasmin,  which 
subsequently  lyses  fibrin  thrombi.  Although  considerable  emphasis 
was first placed on a distinction between more fibrin-specific agents, 
such as tPA, and non-fibrin-specific agents, such as streptokinase, it is 
now recognized that these differences are only relative, as some degree 
of systemic fibrinolysis occurs with the former agents. TNK and rPA 
are referred to as bolus fibrinolytics since their administration does not 
require a prolonged intravenous infusion.

When assessed angiographically, flow in the culprit coronary artery 
is  described  by  a  simple  qualitative  scale  called  the  Thrombolysis  in 
Myocardial  Infarction  (TIMI)  grading  system:  grade  0  indicates  com-
plete  occlusion  of  the  infarct-related  artery;  grade  1  indicates  some 
penetration of the contrast material beyond the point of obstruction, 
but without perfusion of the distal coronary bed; grade 2 indicates per-
fusion of the entire infarct vessel into the distal bed, but with flow that 
is delayed compared with that of a normal artery; and grade 3 indicates 
full perfusion of the infarct vessel with normal flow. The latter is the 
goal of reperfusion therapy, because full perfusion of the infarct-related 
coronary artery yields far better results in terms of limiting infarct size, 
maintenance of LV function, and reduction of both short- and long-
term mortality rates. Additional methods of angiographic assessment 
of the efficacy of fibrinolysis include counting the number of frames 
on the cine film required for dye to flow from the origin of the infarct- 
related  artery  to  a  landmark  in  the  distal  vascular  bed  (TIMI  frame 
count) and determining the rate of entry and exit of contrast dye from 
the microvasculature in the myocardial infarct zone (TIMI myocardial 
perfusion grade). These methods have an even tighter correlation with 
outcomes after STEMI than the more commonly employed TIMI flow 
grade.

tPA and the other relatively fibrin-specific plasminogen activators, 
rPA  and  TNK,  are  more  effective  than  streptokinase  at  restoring  full 
perfusion—i.e., TIMI grade 3 coronary flow—and have a small edge in 
improving survival as well. The current recommended regimen of tPA 
consists  of  a  15-mg  bolus  followed  by  50  mg  intravenously  over  the 
first 30 min, followed by 35 mg over the next 60 min. Streptokinase is 
administered as 1.5 million units (MU) intravenously over 1 h. rPA is 
administered in a double-bolus regimen consisting of a 10-MU bolus 
given over 2–3 min, followed by a second 10-MU bolus 30 min later. 
TNK is given as a single weight-based intravenous bolus of 0.53 mg/
kg  over  10  s.  In  addition  to  the  fibrinolytic  agents  discussed  earlier, 
pharmacologic  reperfusion  typically  involves  adjunctive  antiplatelet 
and antithrombotic drugs, as discussed subsequently.

Clear  contraindications  to  the  use  of  fibrinolytic  agents  include 
a  history  of  cerebrovascular  hemorrhage  at  any  time,  a  nonhemor-
rhagic  stroke  or  other  cerebrovascular  event  within  the  past  year, 
marked hypertension (a reliably determined systolic arterial pressure  
>180  mmHg  and/or  a  diastolic  pressure  >110  mmHg)  at  any  time 
during the acute presentation, suspicion of aortic dissection, and active 
internal bleeding (excluding menses). While advanced age is associated 
with an increase in hemorrhagic complications, the benefit of fibrino-
lytic  therapy  in  the  elderly  appears  to  justify  its  use  if  no  other  con-
traindications are present and the amount of myocardium in jeopardy 
appears to be substantial.

Relative  contraindications  to  fibrinolytic  therapy,  which  require 
assessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio, include current use of anticoag-
ulants (international normalized ratio ≥2), a recent (<2 weeks) invasive 
or surgical procedure or prolonged (>10 min) cardiopulmonary resus-
citation, known bleeding diathesis, pregnancy, a hemorrhagic ophthal-
mic  condition  (e.g.,  hemorrhagic  diabetic  retinopathy),  active  peptic 
ulcer disease, and a history of severe hypertension that is currently ade-
quately controlled. Because of the risk of an allergic reaction, patients 
should not receive streptokinase if that agent had been received within 
the preceding 5 days to 2 years.

Allergic  reactions  to  streptokinase  occur  in  ~2%  of  patients  who 
receive  it.  While  a  minor  degree  of  hypotension  occurs  in  4–10%  of 
patients given this agent, marked hypotension occurs, although rarely, 
in association with severe allergic reactions.

Hemorrhage is the most frequent and potentially the most serious 
complication.  Because  bleeding  episodes  that  require  transfusion  are 

HPIM21e_Part6_p1797-p2130.indd   2059

2060 more  common  when  patients  require  invasive  procedures,  unneces-
sary  venous  or  arterial  interventions  should  be  avoided  in  patients 
receiving  fibrinolytic  agents.  Hemorrhagic  stroke  is  the  most  serious 
complication and occurs in ~0.5–0.9% of patients being treated with 
these  agents.  This  rate  increases  with  advancing  age,  with  patients  
>70 years experiencing roughly twice the rate of intracranial hemor-
rhage as those <65 years. Large-scale trials have suggested that the rate 
of intracranial hemorrhage with tPA or rPA is slightly higher than with 
streptokinase.
 ■ INTEGRATED REPERFUSION STRATEGY
Evidence has emerged that suggests timely performance of PCI is the pre-
ferred reperfusion strategy in the management of STEMI. Prior approaches 
that  segregated  the  pharmacologic  and  catheter-based  approaches  to 
reperfusion have now been replaced with an integrated approach to triage 
and transfer STEMI patients to receive PCI (Fig. 275-5). To achieve the 
degree  of  integration  required  to  care  for  a  patient  with  STEMI,  all 
communities should create and maintain a regional system of STEMI 
care that includes assessment and continuous quality improvement of 
emergency medical services and hospital-based activities.

Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography should be carried 
out after fibrinolytic therapy if there is evidence of either (1) failure of 
reperfusion (persistent chest pain and ST-segment elevation >90 min), 
in  which  case  a  rescue  PCI  should  be  considered;  or  (2)  coronary 
artery reocclusion (re-elevation of ST segments and/or recurrent chest 
pain)  or  the  development  of  recurrent  ischemia  (such  as  recurrent 
angina  in  the  early  hospital  course  or  a  positive  exercise  stress  test 
before discharge), in which case an urgent PCI should be considered. 
Routine  angiography  and  elective  PCI  even  in  asymptomatic  patients 
following administration of fibrinolytic therapy are used with less fre-
quency, given the numerous technologic advances that have occurred 
in the catheterization laboratory and the increasing number of skilled 
interventionalists. Coronary artery bypass surgery should be reserved 
for patients whose coronary anatomy is unsuited to PCI but in whom 
revascularization appears to be advisable because of extensive jeopar-
dized myocardium or recurrent ischemia.

HOSPITAL PHASE MANAGEMENT
 ■ CORONARY CARE UNITS
These  units  are  routinely  equipped  with  a  system  that  permits  con-
tinuous monitoring of the cardiac rhythm of each patient and hemo-
dynamic  monitoring  in  selected  patients.  Defibrillators,  respirators, 
noninvasive  transthoracic  pacemakers,  and  facilities  for  introducing 
pacing  catheters  and  flow-directed  balloon-tipped  catheters  are  also 
usually  available.  Equally  important  is  the  organization  of  a  highly 
trained  team  of  nurses  who  can  recognize  arrhythmias;  adjust  the 
dosage  of  antiarrhythmic,  vasoactive,  and  anticoagulant  drugs;  and 
perform cardiac resuscitation, including electroshock, when necessary.
Patients  should  be  admitted  to  a  coronary  care  unit  early  in  their 
illness when it is expected that they will derive benefit from the sophis-
ticated and expensive care provided. The availability of electrocardio-
graphic  monitoring  and  trained  personnel  outside  the  coronary  care 
unit has made it possible to admit lower-risk patients (e.g., those not 
hemodynamically  compromised  and  without  active  arrhythmias)  to 
“intermediate care units.”

The  duration  of  stay  in  the  coronary  care  unit  is  dictated  by  the 
ongoing need for intensive care. If symptoms are controlled with oral 
therapy, patients may be transferred out of the coronary care unit. Also, 
patients who have a confirmed STEMI but who are considered to be at 
low risk (no prior infarction and no persistent chest discomfort, CHF, 
hypotension, or cardiac arrhythmias) may be safely transferred out of 
the coronary care unit within 24 h.

Activity  Factors that increase the work of the heart during the ini-
tial hours of infarction may increase the size of the infarct. Therefore, 
patients  with  STEMI  should  be  kept  at  bed  rest  for  the  first  6–12  h. 
However, in the absence of complications, patients should be encour-
aged,  under  supervision,  to  resume  an  upright  posture  by  dangling 
their feet over the side of the bed and sitting in a chair within the first 

24 h. This practice is psychologically beneficial and usually results in a 
reduction in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. In the absence of 
hypotension and other complications, patients typically are ambulating 
in their room with increasing duration, anticipating that they may be 
discharged after 3–5 days.

Diet  Because of the risk of emesis and aspiration soon after STEMI, 
patients should receive either nothing or only clear liquids by mouth 
for  the  first  4–12  h.  The  typical  coronary  care  unit  diet  should  pro-
vide  ≤30%  of  total  calories  as  fat  and  have  a  cholesterol  content  of  
≤300 mg/d. Complex carbohydrates should make up 50–55% of total 
calories. Portions should not be unusually large, and the menu should 
be  enriched  with  foods  that  are  high  in  potassium,  magnesium,  and 
fiber,  but  low  in  sodium.  Diabetes  mellitus  and  hypertriglyceridemia 
are managed by restriction of concentrated sweets in the diet.

Bowel Management  Bed rest and the effect of the narcotics used 
for the relief of pain often lead to constipation. A bedside commode 
rather than a bedpan, a diet rich in bulk, and the routine use of a stool 
softener such as dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (200 mg/d) are recom-
mended. If the patient remains constipated despite these measures, a 
laxative can be prescribed. Contrary to prior belief, it is safe to perform 
a gentle rectal examination on patients with STEMI.

Sedation  Many patients require sedation during hospitalization to 
withstand the period of enforced inactivity with tranquility. Diazepam 
(5 mg), oxazepam (15–30 mg), or lorazepam (0.5–2 mg), given three 
to  four  times  daily,  is  usually  effective.  An  additional  dose  of  any  of 
the above medications may be given at night to ensure adequate sleep. 
Attention to this problem is especially important during the first few 
days  in  the  coronary  care  unit,  where  the  atmosphere  of  24-h  vigi-
lance  may  interfere  with  the  patient’s  sleep.  However,  sedation  is  no 
substitute for reassuring, quiet surroundings. Many drugs used in the 
coronary  care  unit,  such  as  atropine,  H2  blockers,  and  narcotics,  can 
produce delirium, particularly in the elderly. This effect should not be 
confused with agitation, and it is wise to conduct a thorough review of 
the patient’s medications before arbitrarily prescribing additional doses 
of anxiolytics.

PHARMACOTHERAPY
 ■ ANTITHROMBOTIC AGENTS
The  use  of  antiplatelet  and  anticoagulant  therapy  during  the  initial 
phase of STEMI is based on extensive laboratory and clinical evidence 
that  thrombosis  plays  an  important  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  this 
condition. The primary goal of treatment with antiplatelet and antico-
agulant  agents  is  to  maintain  patency  of  the  infarct-related  artery,  in 
conjunction with reperfusion strategies. A secondary goal is to reduce 
the patient’s tendency to thrombosis and, thus, the likelihood of mural 
thrombus formation or deep-venous thrombosis. The degree to which 
antiplatelet  and  anticoagulant  therapy  achieves  these  goals  partly 
determines how effectively it reduces the risk of mortality from STEMI.
As noted previously (see “Management in the Emergency Depart-
ment”  earlier),  aspirin  is  the  standard  antiplatelet  agent  for  patients 
with  STEMI.  The  most  compelling  evidence  for  the  benefits  of  anti-
platelet therapy (mainly with aspirin) in STEMI is found in the com-
prehensive overview by the Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration. Data 
from nearly 20,000 patients with MI enrolled in 15 randomized trials 
were pooled and revealed a relative reduction of 27% in the mortality 
rate,  from  14.2%  in  control  patients  to  10.4%  in  patients  receiving 
antiplatelet agents.

Inhibitors of the P2Y12 ADP receptor prevent activation and aggre-
gation of platelets. The addition of the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel to 
background  treatment  with  aspirin  to  STEMI  patients  reduces  the 
risk  of  clinical  events  (death,  reinfarction,  stroke)  and,  in  patients 
receiving fibrinolytic therapy, has been shown to prevent reocclusion 
of a successfully reperfused infarct artery. Newer P2Y12 ADP receptor 
antagonists,  such  as  prasugrel  and  ticagrelor,  are  more  effective  than 
clopidogrel  in  preventing  ischemic  complications  in  STEMI  patients

undergoing PCI but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 
Glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa  receptor  inhibitors  are  useful  for  preventing 
thrombotic complications in patients with STEMI undergoing PCI.

The standard anticoagulant agent used in clinical practice is unfrac-
tionated heparin (UFH). The available data suggest that when UFH is 
added to a regimen of aspirin and a non-fibrin-specific thrombolytic 
agent such as streptokinase, additional mortality benefit occurs (about 
5 lives saved per 1000 patients treated). The immediate administration 
of intravenous UFH, in addition to a regimen of aspirin and relatively 
fibrin-specific fibrinolytic agents (tPA, rPA, or TNK), helps to maintain 
patency of the infarct-related artery. This effect is achieved at the cost 
of a small increased risk of bleeding. The recommended dose of UFH 
is an initial bolus of 60 U/kg (maximum 4000 U) followed by an initial 
infusion of 12 U/kg per h (maximum 1000 U/h). The activated partial 
thromboplastin  time  during  maintenance  therapy  should  be  1.5–2 
times the control value.

Alternatives to UFH for anticoagulation of patients with STEMI are 
the  low-molecular-weight  heparin  (LMWH)  preparations,  a  synthetic 
version  of  the  critical  pentasaccharide  sequence  (fondaparinux),  and 
the  direct  antithrombin  bivalirudin.  Advantages  of  LMWHs  include 
high bioavailability permitting administration subcutaneously, reliable 
anticoagulation  without  monitoring,  and  greater  anti-Xa:IIa  activity. 
Enoxaparin has been shown to reduce significantly the composite end-
points  of  death/nonfatal  reinfarction  and  death/nonfatal  reinfarction/
urgent revascularization compared with UFH in STEMI patients who 
receive  fibrinolysis.  Treatment  with  enoxaparin  is  associated  with 
higher rates of serious bleeding, but net clinical benefit—a composite 
endpoint  that  combines  efficacy  and  safety—still  favors  enoxaparin 
over  UFH.  Interpretation  of  the  data  on  fondaparinux  is  difficult 
because  of  the  complex  nature  of  the  pivotal  clinical  trial  evaluating 
it  in  STEMI  (OASIS-6).  Fondaparinux  appears  superior  to  placebo 
in  STEMI  patients  not  receiving  reperfusion  therapy,  but  its  relative 
efficacy and safety compared with UFH is less certain. Owing to the 
risk  of  catheter  thrombosis,  fondaparinux  should  not  be  used  alone 
at the time of coronary angiography and PCI but should be combined 
with another anticoagulant with antithrombin activity such as UFH or 
bivalirudin. Trials of bivalirudin used an open-label design to evaluate 
its  efficacy  and  safety  compared  with  UFH  plus  a  glycoprotein  IIb/
IIIa inhibitor. Bivalirudin was associated with a lower rate of bleeding, 
largely driven by reductions in vascular access site hematomas ≥5 cm 
or the administration of blood transfusions.

Patients  with  an  anterior  location  of  the  infarction,  severe  LV 
dysfunction,  heart  failure,  a  history  of  embolism,  two-dimensional 
echocardiographic  evidence  of  mural  thrombus,  or  atrial  fibrillation 
are  at  increased  risk  of  systemic  or  pulmonary  thromboembolism. 
Such individuals should receive full therapeutic levels of anticoagulant 
therapy  (LMWH  or  UFH)  while  hospitalized,  followed  by  at  least  
3 months of warfarin therapy.

 ■ BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR BLOCKERS
The benefits of beta blockers in patients with STEMI can be divided 
into those that occur immediately when the drug is given acutely and 
those that accrue over the long term when the drug is given for sec-
ondary prevention after an infarction. Acute intravenous beta blockade 
improves  the  myocardial  O2  supply-demand  relationship,  decreases 
pain, reduces infarct size, and decreases the incidence of serious ven-
tricular  arrhythmias.  In  patients  who  undergo  fibrinolysis  soon  after 
the onset of chest pain, no incremental reduction in mortality rate is 
seen  with  beta  blockers,  but  recurrent  ischemia  and  reinfarction  are 
reduced.

Thus, beta-blocker therapy after STEMI is useful for most patients 
(including  those  treated  with  an  angiotensin-converting  enzyme 
[ACE] inhibitor) except those in whom it is specifically contraindicated 
(patients with heart failure or severely compromised LV function, heart 
block,  orthostatic  hypotension,  or  a  history  of  asthma)  and  perhaps 
those  whose  excellent  long-term  prognosis  (defined  as  an  expected 
mortality rate of <1% per year, patients <55 years, no previous MI, with 
normal  ventricular  function,  no  complex  ventricular  ectopy,  and  no 
angina) markedly diminishes any potential benefit.

 ■ INHIBITION OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-
ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM
ACE inhibitors reduce the mortality rate after STEMI, and the mortal-
ity benefits are additive to those achieved with aspirin and beta block-
ers. The maximum benefit is seen in high-risk patients (those who are 
elderly or who have an anterior infarction, a prior infarction, and/or 
globally  depressed  LV  function),  but  evidence  suggests  that  a  short-
term benefit occurs when ACE inhibitors are prescribed unselectively 
to all hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI (i.e., those with a 
systolic  pressure  >100  mmHg).  The  mechanism  involves  a  reduction 
in ventricular remodeling after infarction (see “Ventricular Dysfunc-
tion” later) with a subsequent reduction in the risk of CHF. The rate of 
recurrent infarction may also be lower in patients treated chronically 
with ACE inhibitors after infarction.

ACE  inhibitors  should  be  continued  indefinitely  in  patients  who 
have  clinically  evident  CHF,  in  patients  in  whom  an  imaging  study 
shows a reduction in global LV function or a large regional wall motion 
abnormality, or in those who are hypertensive.

Angiotensin  receptor  blockers  (ARBs)  should  be  administered  to 
STEMI  patients  who  are  intolerant  of  ACE  inhibitors  and  who  have 
either clinical or radiologic signs of heart failure. Long-term mineral-
ocorticoid receptor inhibition (spironolactone, eplerenone) should be 
prescribed  for  STEMI  patients  without  significant  renal  dysfunction 
(creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL in men and ≥2.0 mg/dL in women) or hyper-
kalemia (potassium ≥5.0 mEq/L) who are already receiving therapeutic 
doses  of  an  ACE  inhibitor,  have  an  LV  ejection  fraction  ≤40%,  and 
have either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes mellitus. A multidrug 
regimen  for  inhibiting  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system  has 
been  shown  to  reduce  both  heart  failure–related  and  sudden  cardiac 
death–related cardiovascular mortality after STEMI.

 ■ OTHER AGENTS
Favorable effects on the ischemic process and ventricular remodeling 
(see below) previously led many physicians to routinely use intravenous 
nitroglycerin (5–10 μg/min initial dose and up to 200 μg/min as long 
as hemodynamic stability is maintained) for the first 24–48 h after the 
onset of infarction. However, the benefits of routine use of intravenous 
nitroglycerin are less in the contemporary era where beta-adrenoceptor 
blockers and ACE inhibitors are routinely prescribed for patients with 
STEMI.

Results of multiple trials of different calcium antagonists have failed 
to  establish  a  role  for  these  agents  in  the  treatment  of  most  patients 
with STEMI. Therefore, the routine use of calcium antagonists cannot 
be recommended. Strict control of blood glucose in diabetic patients 
with  STEMI  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  mortality  rate.  Serum 
magnesium  should  be  measured  in  all  patients  on  admission,  and 
any demonstrated deficits should be corrected to minimize the risk of 
arrhythmias.

COMPLICATIONS AND THEIR 
MANAGEMENT
 ■ VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION
After STEMI, the left ventricle undergoes a series of changes in shape, 
size,  and  thickness  in  both  the  infarcted  and  noninfarcted  segments. 
This process is referred to as ventricular remodeling and generally pre-
cedes the development of clinically evident CHF in the months to years 
after infarction. Soon after STEMI, the left ventricle begins to dilate. 
Acutely,  this  results  from  expansion  of  the  infarct,  i.e.,  slippage  of 
muscle bundles, disruption of normal myocardial cells, and tissue loss 
within  the  necrotic  zone,  resulting  in  disproportionate  thinning  and 
elongation of the infarct zone. Later, lengthening of the noninfarcted 
segments occurs as well. The overall chamber enlargement that occurs 
is related to the size and location of the infarct, with greater dilation 
following infarction of the anterior wall and apex of the left ventricle 
and causing more marked hemodynamic impairment, more frequent 
heart failure, and a poorer prognosis. Progressive dilation and its clin-
ical consequences may be ameliorated by therapy with ACE inhibitors 
and  other  vasodilators  (e.g.,  nitrates).  In  patients  with  an  ejection

2062 fraction  <40%,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  heart  failure  is  present, 
ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be prescribed (see “Inhibition of the 
Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System” earlier).
 ■ HEMODYNAMIC ASSESSMENT
Pump  failure  is  now  the  primary  cause  of  in-hospital  death  from 
STEMI.  The  extent  of  infarction  correlates  well  with  the  degree  of 
pump failure and with mortality, both early (within 10 days of infarc-
tion) and later. The most common clinical signs are pulmonary rales 
and S3 and S4 gallop sounds. Pulmonary congestion is also frequently 
seen on the chest roentgenogram. Elevated LV filling pressure and ele-
vated pulmonary artery pressure are the characteristic hemodynamic 
findings, but these findings may result from a reduction of ventricular 
compliance (diastolic failure) and/or a reduction of stroke volume with 
secondary cardiac dilation (systolic failure) (Chap. 257).

A  classification  originally  proposed  by  Killip  divides  patients  into 
four  groups:  class  I,  no  signs  of  pulmonary  or  venous  congestion; 
class  II,  moderate  heart  failure  as  evidenced  by  rales  at  the  lung 
bases, S3 gallop, tachypnea, or signs of failure of the right side of the 
heart, including venous and hepatic congestion; class III, severe heart 
failure,  pulmonary  edema;  and  class  IV,  shock  with  systolic  pressure 
<90  mmHg  and  evidence  of  peripheral  vasoconstriction,  peripheral 
cyanosis, mental confusion, and oliguria. When this classification was 
established in 1967, the expected hospital mortality rate of patients in 
these classes was as follows: class I, 0–5%; class II, 10–20%; class III, 
35–45%;  and  class  IV,  85–95%.  With  advances  in  management,  the 
mortality rate in each class has fallen, perhaps by as much as one-third 
to one-half.

Hemodynamic  evidence  of  abnormal  global  LV  function  appears 
when contraction is seriously impaired in 20–25% of the left ventricle. 
Infarction of ≥40% of the left ventricle usually results in cardiogenic 
shock  (Chap.  305).  Positioning  of  a  balloon  flotation  (Swan-Ganz) 
catheter in the pulmonary artery permits monitoring of LV filling pres-
sure; this technique is useful in patients who exhibit hypotension and/
or  clinical  evidence  of  CHF.  Cardiac  output  can  also  be  determined 
with  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter.  With  the  addition  of  intraarterial 
pressure monitoring, systemic vascular resistance can be calculated as 
a guide to adjusting vasopressor and vasodilator therapy. Some patients 
with STEMI have markedly elevated LV filling pressures (>22 mmHg) 
and  normal  cardiac  indices  (2.6–3.6  L/[min/m2]),  while  others  have 
relatively  low  LV  filling  pressures  (<15  mmHg)  and  reduced  cardiac 
indices.  The  former  patients  usually  benefit  from  diuresis,  while  the 
latter may respond to volume expansion.
 ■ HYPOVOLEMIA
This  is  an  easily  corrected  condition  that  may  contribute  to  the 
hypotension  and  vascular  collapse  associated  with  STEMI  in  some 
patients. It may be secondary to previous diuretic use, to reduced fluid 
intake during the early stages of the illness, and/or to vomiting asso-
ciated  with  pain  or  medications.  Consequently,  hypovolemia  should 
be identified and corrected in patients with STEMI and hypotension 
before more vigorous forms of therapy are begun. Central venous pres-
sure  reflects  RV  rather  than  LV  filling  pressure  and  is  an  inadequate 
guide for adjustment of blood volume because LV function is almost 
always affected much more adversely than RV function in patients with 
STEMI.  The  optimal  LV  filling  or  pulmonary  artery  wedge  pressure 
may vary considerably among patients. Each patient’s ideal level (gen-
erally ~20 mmHg) is reached by cautious fluid administration during 
careful monitoring of oxygenation and cardiac output. Eventually, the 
cardiac  output  plateaus,  and  further  increases  in  LV  filling  pressure 
only increase congestive symptoms and decrease systemic oxygenation 
without raising arterial pressure.

TREATMENT
Congestive Heart Failure

The management of CHF in association with STEMI is similar to 
that of acute heart failure secondary to other forms of heart disease 
(avoidance  of  hypoxemia,  diuresis,  afterload  reduction,  inotropic 

support) (Chap. 257), except that the benefits of digitalis admin-
istration  to  patients  with  STEMI  are  unimpressive.  By  contrast, 
diuretic agents are extremely effective, as they diminish pulmonary 
congestion in the presence of systolic and/or diastolic heart failure. 
LV filling pressure falls and orthopnea and dyspnea improve after 
the intravenous administration of furosemide or other loop diuret-
ics. These drugs should be used with caution, however, as they can 
result  in  a  massive  diuresis  with  associated  decreases  in  plasma 
volume, cardiac output, systemic blood pressure, and, hence, coro-
nary perfusion. Nitrates in various forms may be used to decrease 
preload and congestive symptoms. Oral isosorbide dinitrate, topical 
nitroglycerin ointment, and intravenous nitroglycerin all have the 
advantage over a diuretic of lowering preload through venodilation 
without  decreasing  the  total  plasma  volume.  In  addition,  nitrates 
may improve ventricular compliance if ischemia is present, as ische-
mia causes an elevation of LV filling pressure. Vasodilators must be 
used with caution to prevent serious hypotension. As noted earlier, 
ACE inhibitors are an ideal class of drugs for management of ven-
tricular dysfunction after STEMI, especially for the long term. (See 
“Inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System” earlier.)

 ■ CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
Prompt  reperfusion,  efforts  to  reduce  infarct  size,  and  treatment 
of  ongoing  ischemia  and  other  complications  of  MI  appear  to  have 
reduced the incidence of cardiogenic shock from 20 to ~7%. Among 
those  who  exhibit  cardiogenic  shock,  only  10%  of  patients  with  this 
condition  present  with  it  on  admission,  while  90%  develop  it  during 
hospitalization. Typically, patients who develop cardiogenic shock have 
severe multivessel coronary artery disease with evidence of “piecemeal” 
necrosis extending outward from the original infarct zone. The evalua-
tion and management of cardiogenic shock and severe power failure 
after STEMI are discussed in detail in Chap. 305.
 ■ RIGHT VENTRICULAR INFARCTION
Approximately  one-third  of  patients  with  inferior  infarction  demon-
strate at least a minor degree of RV necrosis. An occasional patient with 
inferoposterior LV infarction also has extensive RV infarction, and rare 
patients present with infarction limited primarily to the RV. Clinically 
significant  RV  infarction  causes  signs  of  severe  RV  failure  (jugular 
venous  distention,  Kussmaul’s  sign,  hepatomegaly  [Chap.  239])  with 
or without hypotension. ST-segment elevations of right-sided precordial 
ECG leads, particularly lead V4R, are frequently present in the first 24 h in 
patients with RV infarction. Two-dimensional echocardiography is help-
ful in determining the degree of RV dysfunction. Catheterization of the 
right side of the heart often reveals a distinctive hemodynamic pattern 
resembling constrictive pericarditis (steep right atrial “y” descent and an 
early diastolic dip and plateau in RV waveforms) (Chap. 270). Therapy 
consists  of  volume  expansion  to  maintain  adequate  RV  preload  and 
efforts to improve LV performance with attendant reduction in pulmo-
nary capillary wedge and pulmonary arterial pressures.
 ■ ARRHYTHMIAS
(See  also  Chaps.  244  and  246)  The  incidence  of  arrhythmias  after 
STEMI is higher in patients seen early after the onset of symptoms. The 
mechanisms  responsible  for  infarction-related  arrhythmias  include 
autonomic nervous system imbalance, electrolyte disturbances, ische-
mia,  and  slowed  conduction  in  zones  of  ischemic  myocardium.  An 
arrhythmia  can  usually  be  managed  successfully  if  trained  personnel 
and  appropriate  equipment  are  available  when  it  develops.  Since 
most  deaths  from  arrhythmia  occur  during  the  first  few  hours  after 
infarction,  the  effectiveness  of  treatment  relates  directly  to  the  speed 
with  which  patients  come  under  medical  observation.  The  prompt 
management  of  arrhythmias  constitutes  a  significant  advance  in  the 
treatment of STEMI.

Ventricular  Premature  Beats 
Infrequent,  sporadic  ventricular 
premature depolarizations occur in almost all patients with STEMI and 
do  not  require  therapy.  Whereas  in  the  past,  frequent,  multifocal,  or 
early diastolic ventricular extrasystoles (so-called warning arrhythmias)

were routinely treated with antiarrhythmic drugs to reduce the risk of 
development  of  ventricular  tachycardia  and  ventricular  fibrillation, 
pharmacologic  therapy  is  now  reserved  for  patients  with  sustained 
ventricular  arrhythmias.  Prophylactic  antiarrhythmic  therapy  (either 
intravenous lidocaine early or oral agents later) is contraindicated for 
ventricular premature beats in the absence of clinically important ven-
tricular tachyarrhythmias because such therapy may actually increase 
the  mortality  rate.  Beta-adrenoceptor  blocking  agents  are  effective 
in  abolishing  ventricular  ectopic  activity  in  patients  with  STEMI 
and  in  the  prevention  of  ventricular  fibrillation.  As  described  earlier 
(see  “Beta-Adrenoceptor  Blockers”),  they  should  be  used  routinely 
in  patients  without  contraindications.  In  addition,  hypokalemia  and 
hypomagnesemia are risk factors for ventricular fibrillation in patients 
with  STEMI;  to  reduce  the  risk,  the  serum  potassium  concentration 
should be adjusted to ~4.5 mmol/L and magnesium to ~2.0 mmol/L.
Ventricular  Tachycardia  and  Fibrillation  Within  the  first 
24  h  of  STEMI,  ventricular  tachycardia  and  fibrillation  can  occur 
without  prior  warning  arrhythmias.  The  occurrence  of  ventricular 
fibrillation can be reduced by prophylactic administration of intrave-
nous  lidocaine.  However,  prophylactic  use  of  lidocaine  has  not  been 
shown to reduce overall mortality from STEMI. In fact, in addition to 
causing possible noncardiac complications, lidocaine may predispose 
to  an  excess  risk  of  bradycardia  and  asystole.  For  these  reasons,  and 
with  earlier  treatment  of  active  ischemia,  more  frequent  use  of  beta- 
blocking agents, and the nearly universal success of electrical cardio-
version  or  defibrillation,  routine  prophylactic  antiarrhythmic  drug 
therapy is no longer recommended.

Sustained ventricular tachycardia that is well tolerated hemodynam-
ically  should  be  treated  with  an  intravenous  regimen  of  amiodarone 
(bolus of 150 mg over 10 min, followed by infusion of 1.0 mg/min for 
6  h  and  then  0.5  mg/min).  A  less  desirable  but  alternative  regimen  is 
procainamide (bolus of 15 mg/kg over 20–30 min; infusion of 1–4 mg/
min).  If  ventricular  tachycardia  does  not  stop  promptly,  electroversion 
should be used (Chap. 246). An unsynchronized discharge of 200–300 J 
(monophasic  waveform;  ~50%  of  these  energies  with  biphasic  wave-
forms)  is  used  immediately  in  patients  with  ventricular  fibrillation 
or  when  ventricular  tachycardia  causes  hemodynamic  deterioration. 
Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation that is refractory to electroshock 
may be more responsive after the patient is treated with epinephrine  
(1 mg intravenously or 10 mL of a 1:10,000 solution via the intracardiac 
route) or amiodarone (a 75–150-mg bolus).

Ventricular arrhythmias, including the unusual form of ventricular 
tachycardia known as torsades des pointes (Chaps. 252 and 254), may 
occur  in  patients  with  STEMI  as  a  consequence  of  other  concurrent 
problems  (such  as  hypoxia,  hypokalemia,  or  other  electrolyte  distur-
bances)  or  of  the  toxic  effects  of  an  agent  being  administered  to  the 
patient  (such  as  digoxin  or  quinidine).  A  search  for  such  secondary 
causes should always be undertaken.

Although the in-hospital mortality rate is increased, the long-term 
survival is excellent in patients who survive to hospital discharge after 
primary  ventricular  fibrillation;  i.e.,  ventricular  fibrillation  that  is  a 
primary  response  to  acute  ischemia  that  occurs  during  the  first  48  h 
and  is  not  associated  with  predisposing  factors  such  as  CHF,  shock, 
bundle branch block, or ventricular aneurysm. This result is in sharp 
contrast  to  the  poor  prognosis  for  patients  who  develop  ventricular 
fibrillation secondary to severe pump failure. For patients who develop 
ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation late in their hospital 
course  (i.e.,  after  the  first  48  h),  the  mortality  rate  is  increased  both 
in-hospital  and  during  long-term  follow-up.  Such  patients  should 
be  considered  for  electrophysiologic  study  and  implantation  of  a 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (Chap. 252). A more challenging issue 
is the prevention of sudden cardiac death from ventricular fibrillation 
late after STEMI in patients who have not exhibited sustained ventric-
ular tachyarrhythmias during their index hospitalization. An algorithm 
for selection of patients who warrant prophylactic implantation of an 
ICD is shown in Fig. 275-6.
Accelerated  Idioventricular  Rhythm  Accelerated  idioventric-
ular  rhythm  (AIVR,  “slow  ventricular  tachycardia”),  a  ventricular 

rhythm  with  a  rate  of  60–100  beats/min,  often  occurs  transiently 
during  fibrinolytic  therapy  at  the  time  of  reperfusion.  For  the  most 
part, AIVR, whether it occurs in association with fibrinolytic therapy 
or spontaneously, is benign and does not presage the development of 
classic ventricular tachycardia. Most episodes of AIVR do not require 
treatment if the patient is monitored carefully, as degeneration into a 
more serious arrhythmia is rare.

Supraventricular  Arrhythmias  Sinus  tachycardia  is  the  most 
common  supraventricular  arrhythmia.  If  it  occurs  secondary  to 
another  cause  (such  as  anemia,  fever,  heart  failure,  or  a  metabolic 
derangement), the primary problem should be treated first. However, 
if it appears to be due to sympathetic overstimulation (e.g., as part of a 
hyperdynamic state), then treatment with a beta blocker is indicated. 
Other common arrhythmias in this group are atrial flutter and atrial 
fibrillation,  which  are  often  secondary  to  LV  failure.  Digoxin  is  usu-
ally the treatment of choice for supraventricular arrhythmias if heart 
failure  is  present.  If  heart  failure  is  absent,  beta  blockers,  verapamil, 
and  diltiazem  are  suitable  alternatives  for  controlling  the  ventricular 
rate, as they may also help to control ischemia. If the abnormal rhythm 
persists for >2 h with a ventricular rate >120 beats/min or if tachycardia 
induces heart failure, shock, or ischemia (as manifested by recurrent 
pain or ECG changes), a synchronized electroshock (100–200 J mono-
phasic waveform) should be used.

Accelerated junctional rhythms have diverse causes but may occur 
in  patients  with  inferoposterior  infarction.  Digitalis  excess  must  be 
ruled  out.  In  some  patients  with  severely  compromised  LV  function, 
the loss of appropriately timed atrial systole results in a marked reduc-
tion of cardiac output. Right atrial or coronary sinus pacing is indicated 
in such instances.

Sinus  Bradycardia  Treatment  of  sinus  bradycardia  is  indicated 
if  hemodynamic  compromise  results  from  the  slow  heart  rate.  Atro-
pine  is  the  most  useful  drug  for  increasing  heart  rate  and  should  be 
given  intravenously  in  doses  of  0.5  mg  initially.  If  the  rate  remains  
<50–60 beats/min, additional doses of 0.2 mg, up to a total of 2.0 mg, 
may be given. Persistent bradycardia (<40 beats/min) despite atropine 
may be treated with electrical pacing. Isoproterenol should be avoided.

Atrioventricular and Intraventricular Conduction Disturbances  
(See also Chap. 244) Both the in-hospital mortality rate and the post-
discharge mortality rate of patients who have complete atrioventricular 
(AV) block in association with anterior infarction are markedly higher 
than those of patients who develop AV block with inferior infarction. 
This difference is related to the fact that heart block in inferior infarc-
tion  is  commonly  a  result  of  increased  vagal  tone  and/or  the  release 
of  adenosine  and  therefore  is  transient.  In  anterior  wall  infarction, 
however,  heart  block  is  usually  related  to  ischemic  malfunction  of 
the conduction system, which is commonly associated with extensive 
myocardial necrosis.

Temporary electrical pacing provides an effective means of increas-
ing the heart rate of patients with bradycardia due to AV block. How-
ever, acceleration of the heart rate may have only a limited impact on 
prognosis in patients with anterior wall infarction and complete heart 
block in whom the large size of the infarct is the major factor deter-
mining outcome. It should be carried out if it improves hemodynamics. 
Pacing  does  appear  to  be  beneficial  in  patients  with  inferoposterior 
infarction who have complete heart block associated with heart failure, 
hypotension,  marked  bradycardia,  or  significant  ventricular  ectopic 
activity. A subgroup of these patients, those with RV infarction, often 
respond poorly to ventricular pacing because of the loss of the atrial 
contribution to ventricular filling. In such patients, dual-chamber AV 
sequential pacing may be required.

External  noninvasive  pacing  electrodes  should  be  positioned  in  a 
“demand”  mode  for  patients  with  sinus  bradycardia  (rate  <50  beats/
min)  that  is  unresponsive  to  drug  therapy,  Mobitz  II  second-degree 
AV  block,  third-degree  heart  block,  or  bilateral  bundle  branch  block 
(e.g.,  right  bundle  branch  block  plus  left  anterior  fascicular  block). 
Retrospective  studies  suggest  that  permanent  pacing  may  reduce  the 
long-term  risk  of  sudden  death  due  to  bradyarrhythmias  in  the  rare

device, it is associated with frequent alarms, skin irritation, and emotional distress, which results in reduced wear time in a large number of patients. (Reproduced with

patient  who  develops  combined  persistent  bifascicular  and  transient 
third-degree heart block during the acute phase of MI.

 ■ OTHER COMPLICATIONS
Recurrent  Chest  Discomfort  Because  recurrent  or  persistent 
ischemia often heralds extension of the original infarct or reinfarction 
in a new myocardial zone and is associated with a near tripling of mor-
tality  after  STEMI,  patients  with  these  symptoms  should  be  referred 
for prompt coronary arteriography and mechanical revascularization. 
Administration of a fibrinolytic agent is an alternative to early mechan-
ical revascularization.

Pericarditis 
(See also Chap. 270) Pericardial friction rubs and/or 
pericardial  pain  are  frequently  encountered  in  patients  with  STEMI 
involving the epicardium. This complication can usually be managed 
with  aspirin  (650  mg  four  times  daily).  It  is  important  to  diagnose 
the chest pain of pericarditis accurately because failure to recognize it 
may lead to the erroneous diagnosis of recurrent ischemic pain and/or 
infarct  extension,  with  resulting  inappropriate  use  of  anticoagulants, 
nitrates,  beta  blockers,  or  coronary  arteriography.  When  it  occurs, 
complaints  of  pain  radiating  to  either  trapezius  muscle  is  helpful 
because such a pattern of discomfort is typical of pericarditis but rarely 
occurs  with  ischemic  discomfort.  Anticoagulants  potentially  could 
cause tamponade in the presence of acute pericarditis (as manifested by 
either pain or persistent rub) and therefore should not be used unless 
there is a compelling indication.

Thromboembolism  Clinically  apparent  thromboembolism  com-
plicates  STEMI  in  ~10%  of  cases,  but  embolic  lesions  are  found  in 
20% of patients in necropsy series, suggesting that thromboembolism 
is  often  clinically  silent.  Thromboembolism  is  considered  to  be  an 

important contributing cause of death in 25% of patients with STEMI 
who die after admission to the hospital. Arterial emboli originate from 
LV mural thrombi, while most pulmonary emboli arise in the leg veins.
Thromboembolism  typically  occurs  in  association  with  large 
infarcts  (especially  anterior),  CHF,  and  an  LV  thrombus  detected  by 
echocardiography.  The  incidence  of  arterial  embolism  from  a  clot 
originating in the ventricle at the site of an infarction is small but real. 
Two-dimensional echocardiography reveals LV thrombi in about one-
third of patients with anterior wall infarction but in few patients with 
inferior or posterior infarction. Arterial embolism often presents as a 
major complication, such as hemiparesis when the cerebral circulation 
is  involved  or  hypertension  if  the  renal  circulation  is  compromised. 
When a thrombus has been clearly demonstrated by echocardiographic 
or  other  techniques  or  when  a  large  area  of  regional  wall  motion 
abnormality is seen even in the absence of a detectable mural throm-
bus, systemic anticoagulation should be undertaken (in the absence of 
contraindications), as the incidence of embolic complications appears 
to be markedly lowered by such therapy. The appropriate duration of 
therapy is unknown, but 3–6 months is probably prudent.

Left  Ventricular  Aneurysm  The  term  ventricular  aneurysm  is 
usually used to describe dyskinesis or local expansile paradoxical wall 
motion.  Normally  functioning  myocardial  fibers  must  shorten  more 
if stroke volume and cardiac output are to be maintained in patients 
with ventricular aneurysm; if they cannot, overall ventricular function 
is impaired. True aneurysms are composed of scar tissue and neither 
predispose to nor are associated with cardiac rupture.

The complications of LV aneurysm do not usually occur for weeks 
to  months  after  STEMI;  they  include  CHF,  arterial  embolism,  and 
ventricular arrhythmias. Apical aneurysms are the most common and 
the most easily detected by clinical examination. The physical finding

of greatest value is a double, diffuse, or displaced apical impulse. Ven-
tricular aneurysms are readily detected by two-dimensional echocar-
diography, which may also reveal a mural thrombus in an aneurysm.

Rarely, myocardial rupture may be contained by a local area of peri-
cardium, along with organizing thrombus and hematoma. Over time, 
this  pseudoaneurysm  enlarges,  maintaining  communication  with  the 
LV  cavity  through  a  narrow  neck.  Because  a  pseudoaneurysm  often 
ruptures spontaneously, it should be surgically repaired if recognized.

POSTINFARCTION RISK STRATIFICATION 
AND MANAGEMENT
Many  clinical  and  laboratory  factors  have  been  identified  that  are 
associated  with  an  increase  in  cardiovascular  risk  after  initial  recov-
ery  from  STEMI.  Some  of  the  most  important  factors  include  per-
sistent  ischemia  (spontaneous  or  provoked),  depressed  LV  ejection 
fraction  (<40%),  rales  above  the  lung  bases  on  physical  examination 
or  congestion  on  chest  radiograph,  and  symptomatic  ventricular 
arrhythmias.  Other  features  associated  with  increased  risk  include  a 
history  of  previous  MI,  age  >75,  diabetes  mellitus,  prolonged  sinus 
tachycardia, hypotension, ST-segment changes at rest without angina 
(“silent ischemia”), an abnormal signal-averaged ECG, nonpatency of 
the infarct-related coronary artery (if angiography is undertaken), and 
persistent advanced heart block or a new intraventricular conduction 
abnormality on the ECG. Therapy must be individualized on the basis 
of the relative importance of the risk(s) present.

The  goal  of  preventing  reinfarction  and  death  after  recovery  from 
STEMI  has  led  to  strategies  to  evaluate  risk  after  infarction.  In  stable 
patients, submaximal exercise stress testing may be carried out before 
hospital  discharge  to  detect  residual  ischemia  and  ventricular  ectopy 
and  to  provide  the  patient  with  a  guideline  for  exercise  in  the  early 
recovery  period.  Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  a  maximal  (symptom- 
limited) exercise stress test may be carried out 4–6 weeks after infarc-
tion.  Evaluation  of  LV  function  is  usually  warranted  as  well.  Recog-
nition  of  a  depressed  LV  ejection  fraction  by  echocardiography  or 
radionuclide  ventriculography  identifies  patients  who  should  receive 
medications  to  inhibit  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system. 
Patients in whom angina is induced at relatively low workloads, those 
who have a large reversible defect on perfusion imaging or a depressed 
ejection  fraction,  those  with  demonstrable  ischemia,  and  those  in 
whom exercise provokes symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias should 
be considered at high risk for recurrent MI or death from arrhythmia 
(Fig. 275-6). Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography and/
or invasive electrophysiologic evaluation is advised.

Exercise tests also aid in formulating an individualized exercise pre-
scription, which can be much more vigorous in patients who tolerate 
exercise  without  any  of  the  previously  mentioned  adverse  signs.  In 
addition,  predischarge  stress  testing  may  provide  an  important  psy-
chological benefit, building the patient’s confidence by demonstrating 
a reasonable exercise tolerance.

In  many  hospitals,  a  cardiac  rehabilitation  program  with  progres-
sive exercise is initiated in the hospital and continued after discharge. 
Ideally, such programs should include an educational component that 
informs patients about their disease and its risk factors.

The usual duration of hospitalization for an uncomplicated STEMI 
is  about  3–5  days.  The  remainder  of  the  convalescent  phase  may  be 
accomplished at home. During the first 1–2 weeks, the patient should 
be encouraged to increase activity by walking about the house and out-
doors in good weather. Normal sexual activity may be resumed during 
this period. After 2 weeks, the physician should regulate the patient’s 
activity on the basis of exercise tolerance. Most patients will be able to 
return to work within 2–4 weeks.

SECONDARY PREVENTION
Various secondary preventive measures are at least partly responsible for 
the improvement in the long-term mortality and morbidity rates after 
STEMI. Long-term treatment with an antiplatelet agent (usually aspirin) 
after STEMI is associated with a 25% reduction in the risk of recurrent 
infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular mortality (36 fewer events for every 
1000  patients  treated).  An  alternative  antiplatelet  agent  that  may  be 

used for secondary prevention in patients intolerant of aspirin is clopi-
dogrel (75 mg orally daily). ACE inhibitors or ARBs and, in appropriate 
patients, aldosterone antagonists should be used indefinitely by patients 
with clinically evident heart failure, a moderate decrease in global ejec-
tion fraction, or a large regional wall motion abnormality to prevent late 
ventricular remodeling and recurrent ischemic events.

The  chronic  routine  use  of  oral  beta-adrenoceptor  blockers  for  at 
least  2  years  after  STEMI  is  supported  by  well-conducted,  placebo-
controlled trials.

Evidence suggests that warfarin lowers the risk of late mortality and 
the  incidence  of  reinfarction  after  STEMI.  Most  physicians  prescribe 
aspirin  routinely  for  all  patients  without  contraindications  and  add 
warfarin  for  patients  at  increased  risk  of  embolism  (see  “Thrombo-
embolism”  earlier).  Several  studies  suggest  that  in  patients  <75  years 
old a low dose of aspirin (75–81 mg/d) in combination with warfarin 
administered to achieve an international normalized ratio >2.0 is more 
effective than aspirin alone for preventing recurrent MI and embolic 
cerebrovascular accident. However, there is an increased risk of bleed-
ing  and  a  high  rate  of  discontinuation  of  warfarin  that  has  limited 
clinical acceptance of combination antithrombotic therapy. There is an 
increased risk of bleeding when warfarin is added to dual antiplatelet 
therapy  (see  Chap.  273).  However,  patients  who  have  had  a  stent 
implanted  and  have  an  indication  for  anticoagulation  should  receive 
dual  antiplatelet  therapies  in  combination  with  warfarin.  (See  Chap. 
273 for further discussion.) Such patients should also receive a proton 
pump inhibitor to minimize the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and 
should  have  regular  monitoring  of  their  hemoglobin  levels  and  stool 
hematest while on combination antithrombotic therapy.

Finally,  risk  factors  for  atherosclerosis  (Chap.  237)  should  be  dis-

cussed with the patient and, when possible, favorably modified.

Interventional cardiology is a separate discipline in cardiology that 
requires a dedicated 1- or 2-year interventional cardiology fellowship 
following  a  3-year  general  cardiology  fellowship  in  order  to  obtain 
a  separate  board  certification.  The  discipline  has  also  expanded  to 
include interventions for structural heart disease including treatment 
of congenital heart disease and valvular heart disease; it also includes 
interventions to treat peripheral vascular disease, including atheroscle-
rotic  and  nonatherosclerotic  lesions  in  the  carotid,  renal,  aortic,  and 
peripheral arterial and venous circulations.

276 Percutaneous Coronary 
Interventions and Other 
Interventional Procedures
David P. Faxon, Deepak L. Bhatt

Percutaneous  transluminal  coronary  angioplasty  (PTCA)  was  first 
introduced by Andreas Gruentzig in 1977 as an alternative to coronary 
bypass surgery. The concept was initially demonstrated by Charles Dot-
ter in 1964 in peripheral vessels. The development of a small inelastic 
balloon catheter by Gruentzig allowed expansion of the technique into 
smaller  peripheral  and  coronary  vessels.  Initial  coronary  experience 
was  limited  to  single-vessel  coronary  disease  and  discrete  proximal 
lesions due to the technical limitations of the equipment. Advances in 
technology with smaller profile balloon catheters and movable steer-
able guidewires and greater operator experience allowed the procedure 
to  grow  rapidly  with  expanded  use  in  patients  with  more  complex 
lesions and multivessel disease. The introduction of coronary stents in 
1994 was one of the major advances in the field. These devices reduced 
acute  complications  and  reduced  by  half  the  significant  problems  of 
acute  thrombosis  and  late  restenosis  (or  recurrence  of  the  stenosis). 
Further reductions in restenosis were achieved by the introduction of 
drug-eluting stents in 2003. These stents slowly release antiproliferative 
drugs directly into the plaque over a few months. Percutaneous coro-
nary intervention (PCI) is the most common revascularization proce-
dure in the United States and is performed more than twice as often as 
coronary artery bypass surgery: >900,000 patients a year.

TECHNIQUE
The initial procedure is performed in a similar manner as a diagnostic 
cardiac catheterization (Chap. 242). Arterial access is obtained via the 
radial or femoral artery. To prevent thrombotic complications during 
the  procedure,  patients  who  are  anticipated  to  need  an  angioplasty 
are given aspirin (325 mg) and may be given a platelet P2Y12 inhibitor 
such as clopidogrel (loading dose of 600 mg), prasugrel (loading dose 
of 60 mg), or ticagrelor (loading dose of 180 mg) before the procedure. 
Cangrelor, a potent IV P2Y12 inhibitor, is approved for use in patients 
who have not received an oral agent prior to the procedure. During the 
procedure,  anticoagulation  is  achieved  by  administration  of  unfrac-
tionated  heparin,  enoxaparin  (a  low-molecular-weight  heparin),  or 
bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor). In patients with ST-segment 
elevation  myocardial  infarction  (STEMI),  high-risk  acute  coronary 
syndrome, or a large thrombus in the coronary artery, an intravenous 
glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa  inhibitor  (abciximab,  tirofiban,  or  eptifibatide) 
may also be given, although cangrelor appears to be as effective with 
less bleeding risk.

Following placement of an introducing sheath into the artery, pre-
formed guiding catheters are used to cannulate selectively the origins of 
the coronary arteries. Through the guiding catheter, a flexible, steerable 
guidewire is negotiated down the coronary artery lumen using fluoro-
scopic guidance; it is then advanced through the stenosis and into the 
vessel beyond. This guidewire then serves as a “rail” over which angio-
plasty balloons, stents, or other therapeutic devices can be advanced to 
enlarge the narrowed segment of coronary artery. The artery is usually 
dilated with a balloon catheter followed by placement of a stent. The 
catheters and introducing sheath are removed and the artery manually 
held, or in the case of radial access, an inflatable cuff is used. One of 
several  femoral  arterial  closure  devices  can  also  be  used  to  achieve 
hemostasis. Because PCI is performed under local anesthesia and mild 
sedation, it requires only a short (1-day or less) hospitalization.

Angioplasty works by stretching the artery and displacing the plaque 
away  from  the  lumen,  enlarging  the  entire  vessel  (Figs.  276-1  and 
276-2). The procedure rarely results in embolization of atherosclerotic

permanent polymers in preventing late stent thrombosis. In addition, 
the first-generation everolimus-eluting biodegradable vascular scaffold 
(BVS) stent had been shown to be reasonably safe with gradual degra-
dation over several years, although concerns about late and very late 
stent thrombosis ultimately led to its withdrawal from clinical practice. 
Additional  bioresorbable  stents  are  under  investigation.  Drug-coated 
balloons are covered with an antiproliferative drug that can also reduce 
restenosis and are used primarily to treat in-stent restenosis.

Other  interventional  devices  include  atherectomy  devices  and 
thrombectomy  catheters.  These  devices  are  designed  to  remove  ath-
erosclerotic  plaque  or  thrombus  and  are  used  in  conjunction  with 
balloon dilatation and stent placement. Rotational atherectomy is the 
most commonly used adjunctive device and is modeled after a dentist’s 
drill,  with  small  round  burrs  of  1.25–2.5  mm  at  the  tip  of  a  flexible 
wire  shaft.  The  burr  is  passed  over  the  guidewire  up  to  the  stenosis 
and  drills  away  atherosclerotic  material.  Because  the  atherosclerotic 
particles are ≤25 μm, they pass through the coronary microcirculation 
and rarely cause problems. The device is particularly useful in heavily 
calcified  plaques  that  are  resistant  to  balloon  dilatation.  Given  the 
current advances in stents, rotational atherectomy is infrequently used. 
Orbital atherectomy is a newer approach to calcified lesions that also 
relies on a spinning burr. Directional atherectomy catheters that slice 
off the plaque and remove it are not used in the coronaries any longer 
but are sometimes used in peripheral artery disease. In acute STEMI, 
specialized catheters without a balloon can be used to aspirate throm-
bus in order to prevent embolization down the coronary vessel and to 
improve  blood  flow  before  angioplasty  and  stent  placement.  Current 
studies show that manual catheter thrombus aspiration should not be 
used  routinely  but,  in  certain  cases  of  a  large  thrombus  burden,  can 
improve blood flow in primary PCI.

PCI of degenerated saphenous vein graft lesions has been associated 
with  a  significant  incidence  of  distal  embolization  of  atherosclerotic 
material, unlike PCI of native vessel disease. A number of distal pro-
tection devices have been shown to significantly reduce embolization 
and myocardial infarction in this setting. Most devices work by using a 
collapsible wire filter at the end of a guidewire that is expanded in the 
distal vessel before PCI. If atherosclerotic debris is dislodged, the bas-
ket captures the material, and at the end of the PCI, the basket is pulled 
into a delivery catheter, and the debris safely removed from the patient.

SUCCESS AND COMPLICATIONS
A  successful  procedure  (angiographic  success),  defined  as  a  reduc-
tion  of  the  stenosis  to  less  than  a  20%  diameter  narrowing,  occurs 
in  95–99%  of  patients.  Lower  success  rates  are  seen  in  patients  with 
tortuous, small, or calcified vessels or chronic total occlusions. Chronic 
total occlusions have the lowest success rates and their recanalization is 
significantly better if the occlusion is recent (within 3 months) or there 
are favorable anatomic features. Improvements in equipment and com-
plex  antegrade  and  retrograde  techniques  have  increased  the  success 
rates of recanalization of chronic total occlusions to 70–80%.

Serious complications are rare but include a mortality rate of 0.1–0.3% 
for  elective  cases,  a  large  myocardial  infarction  in  <3%,  and  stroke  in 
0.1–0.4%. Patients who are older (>65 years), undergoing an emergent 
or urgent procedure, have chronic kidney disease, present with STEMI, 
or are in shock have significantly higher risk. Scoring systems can help 
to estimate the risk of the procedure. Myocardial infarction during PCI 
can occur for multiple reasons including an acute occluding thrombus, 
severe coronary dissection, embolization of thrombus or atherosclerotic 
material, or closure of a side branch vessel at the site of angioplasty or 
stent placement. Most myocardial infarctions are small and only detected 
by a rise in the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) or troponin level after the 
procedure.  Only  those  with  significant  enzyme  elevations  (>10  times 
the upper limit of normal) are associated with a less favorable long-term 
outcome.  Coronary  stents  have  largely  prevented  occlusive  coronary 
dissections due to the scaffolding effect of the stent.

All  types  of  stents  are  prone  to  stent  thrombosis  (1–3%),  either 
acute  (<24  h)  or  subacute  (1–30  days),  which  can  be  ameliorated  by 
greater  attention  to  full  initial  stent  deployment  and  the  use  of  dual 
antiplatelet  therapy  (DAPT)  (aspirin,  plus  a  platelet  P2Y12  receptor

material. Owing to inelastic elements in the plaque, the stretching of 
the vessel by the balloon results in small localized dissections that can 
protrude into the lumen and be a nidus for acute thrombus formation. 
If the dissections are severe, then they can obstruct the lumen or induce 
a thrombotic occlusion of the artery (acute closure). Stents have largely 
prevented this complication by holding the dissection flaps up against 
the vessel wall (Fig. 276-1).

Stents  are  currently  used  in  >90%  of  coronary  angioplasty  proce-
dures. Stents are wire meshes (usually made of stainless steel or other 
metals, such as cobalt chromium or nitinol) that are compressed over 
a deflated angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the stent 
is enlarged to approximate the “normal” vessel lumen. The balloon is 
then deflated and removed, leaving the stent behind to provide a per-
manent scaffold in the artery. Owing to the design of the struts, these 
devices are flexible, allowing their passage through diseased and tortu-
ous coronary vessels. Stents are rigid enough to prevent elastic recoil 
of the vessel and have dramatically improved the success and safety of 
the procedure as a result.

Drug-eluting stents further enhanced the efficacy of PCI. An anti-
proliferative agent is attached to the metal stent by use of a thin poly-
mer coating. The antiproliferative drug elutes from the stent over a 1- to 
3-month period or longer after implantation. Drug-eluting stents have 
been shown to reduce clinical restenosis by 50%, so that in uncompli-
cated lesions, symptomatic restenosis occurs in 5–10% of patients. Not 
surprisingly, this led to the rapid acceptance of these devices; currently 
>90%  of  all  stents  implanted  are  drug-eluting.  The  first-generation 
devices were coated with either sirolimus or paclitaxel. Second-genera-
tion drug-eluting stents use newer agents such as everolimus, biolimus, 
and zotarolimus. These second-generation drug-eluting stents appear 
to  be  more  effective  with  fewer  complications,  such  as  early  or  late 
stent thrombosis, than the first-generation devices and, therefore, have 
replaced  the  first-generation  stents.  Biodegradable  polymers  that  are 
used to attach the drugs to the stents may be theoretically superior to

2068 blocker  [clopidogrel,  prasugrel,  or  ticagrelor]).  Late  (30  days–1  year) 
and  very  late  (>1  year)  stent  thromboses  occur  very  infrequently 
with stents but are slightly more common with first-generation drug- 
eluting stents, necessitating DAPT for up to 1 year or longer. Use of the 
second-generation stents is associated with lower rates of late and very 
late stent thromboses, and shorter durations of DAPT (6 months) are 
recommended for the stent, although longer durations may be useful 
depending  on  the  underlying  atherothrombotic  and  bleeding  risks. 
Premature  discontinuation  of  DAPT,  particularly  in  the  first  month 
after implantation, is associated with a significantly increased risk for 
stent thrombosis (three- to ninefold greater). Stent thrombosis results 
in death in 10–20% and myocardial infarction in 30–70% of patients. 
Elective  surgery  that  requires  discontinuation  of  antiplatelet  therapy 
after drug-eluting stent implantation should be postponed until after  
3 months and preferably after 6 months, if at all possible.

Restenosis,  or  renarrowing  of  the  dilated  coronary  stenosis,  is  the 
most  common  complication  of  angioplasty  and  occurs  in  20–50%  of 
patients with balloon angioplasty alone, 10–30% of patients with bare 
metal  stents,  and  5–15%  of  patients  with  drug-eluting  stents  within 
the  first  year.  The  fact  that  stent  placement  provides  a  larger  acute 
luminal  area  than  balloon  angioplasty  alone  reduces  the  incidence 
of  subsequent  restenosis.  Drug-eluting  stents  further  reduce  rest-
enosis  through  a  reduction  in  excessive  neointimal  growth  over  the 
stent. If restenosis does not occur, the long-term outcome is excellent  
(Fig. 276-3). Clinical restenosis is recognized by recurrence of angina 
or  symptoms  within  12  months  of  the  procedure.  Less  frequently, 
patients  with  restenosis  can  present  with  non-ST-segment  elevation 
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (10%) or STEMI (2%) as well. Very 
late  stent  thrombosis  and  restenosis  after  1  year  is  more  likely  to  be 
due to neoatherosclerosis than intimal hyperplasia seen within the first 
year. Clinical restenosis requires confirmation of a significant stenosis 
at the site of the prior PCI. Target lesion revascularization (TLR) or tar-
get vessel revascularization (TVR) is defined as angiographic restenosis 
with repeat PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). By angi-
ography, the incidence of restenosis is significantly higher than clinical 
restenosis (TLR or TVR) because many patients have mild restenosis 
that does not result in a recurrence of symptoms. The management of 
clinical restenosis is usually to repeat the PCI with balloon dilatation 
and placement of another drug-eluting stent. Once a patient has had 
restenosis, the risk of a second restenosis is further increased. The risk 
factors for restenosis are diabetes, myocardial infarction, long lesions, 
small-diameter vessels, and suboptimal initial PCI result. Treatments 

for symptomatic recurrent restenosis include re-stenting (three layers 
of  stent),  brachytherapy,  drug-coated  balloons,  or  coronary  bypass 
surgery.

INDICATIONS
The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Associ-
ation (AHA) guidelines extensively review the indications for PCI in 
patients with stable angina, unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI and 
should be referred to for a comprehensive discussion of the indications. 
Briefly,  the  two  principal  indications  for  coronary  revascularization 
in patients with chronic stable angina (Chap. 273) are (1) to improve 
angina  symptoms  in  patients  who  remain  symptomatic  despite  ade-
quate  medical  therapy  and  (2)  to  reduce  mortality  rates  in  patients 
with  severe  and  extensive  coronary  disease.  In  patients  with  stable 
angina who are well controlled on medical therapy, studies such as the 
Clinical  Outcomes  Utilizing  Revascularization  and  Aggressive  Drug 
Evaluation  (COURAGE)  and  Bypass  Angioplasty  Revascularization 
Investigation  2  Diabetes  (BARI  2D)  trials  have  shown  that  initial 
revascularization does not lead to better outcomes (death or myocar-
dial  infarction)  and  can  be  safely  delayed  until  symptoms  worsen  or 
evidence of severe ischemia on noninvasive testing occurs. The Inter-
national Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and 
Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial was the largest trial comparing 
optimal  medical  therapy  to  revascularization  with  PCI  or  CABG  in 
stable patients with moderate ischemia on stress testing but without left 
main or reduced left ventricular function (<35% ejection fraction). It 
showed that optimal medical therapy was similar to revascularization 
in a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization or in cardio-
vascular death and myocardial infarction at a median of 3.3 years. This 
trial confirms prior studies and supports conservative management in 
most stable patients. When revascularization is indicated due to unac-
ceptable symptoms, the choice of PCI or CABG depends on a number 
of clinical and anatomic factors.

The  Synergy  between  Percutaneous  Coronary  Intervention  with 
Taxus  and  Cardiac  Surgery  (SYNTAX)  trial  compared  PCI  with  the 
paclitaxel drug-eluting stent to CABG in 1800 patients with three-vessel  
coronary disease or left main disease. The study found no difference in 
death or myocardial infarction at 1 year, but repeat revascularization 
was significantly higher in the stent-treated group (13.5 vs 5.9%), while 
stroke was significantly higher in the surgical group (2.2 vs 0.6%). The 
primary endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascu-
larization  was  significantly  better  with  CABG,  particularly  in  those

with  the  most  extensive  coronary  artery  disease  such  as  three-vessel 
disease. The 10-year results confirm these findings. The Future Revas-
cularization  Evaluation  in  Patients  with  Diabetes  Mellitus:  Optimal 
Management  of  Multivessel  Disease  (FREEDOM)  trial  randomized 
1900  patients  with  diabetes  and  multivessel  disease  and  found  a  sig-
nificantly lower primary endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or 
stroke with CABG than PCI. Recent trials comparing PCI with CABG 
have shown similar outcomes for those with less extensive disease, but 
a  better  outcome  when  the  coronary  disease  is  severe  and  extensive. 
These studies support CABG for those with the most severe left main 
and three-vessel disease or those with diabetes. Lesser degrees of mul-
tivessel disease in patients with or without diabetes have an equal out-
come with PCI, including left main disease with favorable angiographic 
characteristics.

The  choice  of  PCI  versus  CABG  is  also  related  to  the  anticipated 
procedural success and complications of PCI and the risks of CABG. 
For  PCI,  the  characteristics  of  the  coronary  anatomy  are  critically 
important. The location of the lesion in the vessel (proximal or distal), 
the  degree  of  tortuosity,  and  the  size  of  the  vessel  are  considered.  In 
addition, the lesion characteristics, including the degree of the stenosis, 
the presence of calcium, lesion length, and presence of thrombus, are 
assessed.  The  most  common  reason  to  decide  not  to  do  PCI  is  that 
the  lesion(s)  felt  to  be  responsible  for  the  patient’s  symptoms  is  not 
treatable. This is most commonly due to the presence of a chronic total 
occlusion (>3 months in duration) with unfavorable characteristics. A 
lesion classification to characterize the likelihood of success or failure 
of PCI has been developed by the ACC/AHA. Lesions with the highest 
success are called type A lesions (such as proximal noncalcified subto-
tal lesions), and those with the lowest success or highest complication 
rate are type C lesions (such as chronic total occlusions). Intermediate 
lesions  are  classified  as  type  B1  or  B2  depending  on  the  number  of 
unfavorable characteristics. Approximately 25–30% of patients will not 
be  candidates  for  PCI  due  to  unfavorable  anatomy,  whereas  only  5% 
of CABG patients will not be candidates for surgery due to coronary 
anatomy.  The  primary  reason  for  being  considered  inoperable  with 
CABG is the presence of severe comorbidities such as advanced age, 
frailty,  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD),  poor 
left ventricular function, or lack of suitable surgical conduits or poor 
distal targets for bypass.

Another  consideration  in  choosing  a  revascularization  strategy  is 
the  degree  of  revascularization.  In  patients  with  multivessel  disease, 
bypass grafts can usually be placed to all vessels >2 mm with significant 
stenosis, whereas PCI may be able to treat only some of the lesions due 
to the presence of unfavorable anatomy. Assessment of the significance 
of  intermediate  lesions  using  fractional  flow  reserve  (FFR)  or  the 
instantaneous  wave-free  ratio  (iFR)  (Chap.  242)  can  assist  in  deter-
mining  which  lesions  should  be  revascularized.  The  Fractional  Flow 
Reserve  versus  Angiography  for  Multivessel  Evaluation  (FAME)  trial 
showed a 30% reduction in adverse events when revascularization by 
PCI was restricted to those lesions that were hemodynamically signifi-
cant (FFR ≤0.80) rather than when guided by angiography alone. Trials 
have shown that iFR is as predictive as FFR but is quicker and easier to 
perform, especially if there are sequential lesions or multivessel disease. 
Thus, complete revascularization of all functionally significant lesions 
should be favored and considered when choosing the optimal revascu-
larization strategy. Given the multiple factors that need to be consid-
ered  in  choosing  the  best  revascularization  for  an  individual  patient 
with multivessel disease, it is optimal to have a discussion among the 
cardiac surgeon, interventional cardiologist, and the physicians caring 
for the patient (so-called Heart Team) to weigh the choices properly.

Patients with acute coronary syndrome are at excess risk of short- 
and  long-term  mortality.  Randomized  clinical  trials  have  shown  that 
PCI  is  superior  to  intensive  medical  therapy  in  reducing  mortality 
and myocardial infarction, with the benefit largely confined to those 
patients who are high risk. High-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute 
coronary syndrome patients are defined as those with any one of the 
following:  refractory  ischemia,  recurrent  angina,  positive  cardiac- 
specific  enzymes,  new  ST-segment  depression,  transient  ST-segment 
elevation,  low  ejection  fraction,  severe  arrhythmias,  or  a  recent  PCI 

or  CABG.  PCI  is  preferred  over  surgical  therapy  in  most  high-risk 
patients  with  acute  coronary  syndromes  unless  they  have  severe 
multivessel  disease  or  the  culprit  lesion  responsible  for  the  unstable 
presentation  cannot  be  adequately  determined  or  treated.  In  STEMI, 
thrombolysis and PCI (primary PCI) are effective methods to restore 
coronary blood flow and salvage myocardium within the first 12 h after 
onset  of  chest  pain.  Because  PCI  is  more  effective  in  restoring  flow 
than thrombolysis, it is preferred if readily available within 90 min of 
presentation to the hospital. PCI is also performed following throm-
bolysis  to  facilitate  adequate  reperfusion  or  as  a  rescue  procedure  in 
those who do not achieve reperfusion from thrombolysis, who cannot 
be rapidly transferred to a hospital that can perform primary PCI, or 
who  develop  cardiogenic  shock.  The  Complete  Versus  Culprit-Only 
Revascularization  Strategies  to  Treat  Multivessel  Disease  After  Early 
PCI  for  STEMI  (COMPLETE)  trial  supports  complete  revasculariza-
tion of nonculprit lesions in STEMI either in the hospital or in the few 
weeks after discharge.

OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
 ■ STRUCTURAL HEART DISEASE
Interventional treatment for structural heart disease (adult congenital 
heart disease and valvular heart disease) is a significant and growing 
component of the field of interventional cardiology.

The most common adult congenital lesion to be treated with percu-
taneous techniques is closure of atrial septal defects (Chap. 269). The 
procedure is done as in a diagnostic right heart catheterization with the 
passage of a catheter up the femoral vein into the right atrium. With 
echo and fluoroscopic guidance, the size and location of the defect can 
be accurately defined, and closure is accomplished using one of several 
approved devices. All devices use a left atrial and right atrial wire mesh 
or  covered  disk  that  are  pulled  together  to  capture  the  atrial  septum 
around the defect and seal it off. The Amplatzer Septal Occluder device 
(AGA Medical, Minneapolis, Minnesota) is the most commonly used 
in the United States. The success rate in selected patients is 85–95%, 
and the device complications are rare and include device embolization, 
infection, or erosion. Closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) is done in 
a similar way. PFO closure may be considered in patients who have had 
recurrent paradoxical stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) despite 
adequate  medical  therapy  including  anticoagulation  or  antiplatelet 
therapy  or  who  are  at  high  risk  for  recurrent  stroke.  The  CLOSURE 
I trial (Evaluation of the STARFlex Closure System in Patients with a 
Stroke and/or Transient Ischemic Attack due to Presumed Paradoxical 
Embolism Through a Patent Foramen Ovale) randomized 909 patients 
with cryptogenic stroke or TIA who had a PFO. Closure did not reduce 
the primary endpoint of death within 30 days or death following a neu-
rologic cause during 2 years of follow-up or stroke/TIA within 2 years. 
Other short-term trials confirmed these findings. However, the 10-year 
follow-up from the Randomized Evaluation of Recurrent Stroke Com-
paring  PFO  Closure  to  Established  Current  Standard  of  Care  Treat-
ment (RESPECT) trial did find a benefit of closure in reducing the risk 
for recurrent cryptogenic stroke, as have meta-analyses examining the 
longer-term effects of closures in appropriate patients. The use in the 
treatment of migraine is not supported by the current data.

Similar  devices  can  also  be  used  to  close  patent  ductus  arteriosus 
and  ventricular  septal  defects.  Other  congenital  diseases  that  can  be 
treated  percutaneously  include  coarctation  of  the  aorta,  pulmonic 
stenosis, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and other abnormal commu-
nications between the cardiac chambers or vessels.

The treatment of valvular heart disease is the most rapidly growing 
area in interventional cardiology. In the past, the only available tech-
niques were balloon valvuloplasty for the treatment of aortic, mitral, 
or pulmonic stenosis (Chap. 261). Mitral valvuloplasty is the preferred 
treatment  for  symptomatic  patients  with  rheumatic  mitral  stenosis 
who have favorable anatomy. The outcome in these patients is equal to 
that of surgical commissurotomy. The success is highly related to the 
echocardiographic appearance of the valve. The most favorable setting 
is commissural fusion without calcification or subchordal fusion and 
the absence of significant mitral regurgitation. Access is obtained from

the femoral vein using a transseptal technique in which a long metal 
catheter with a needle tip is advanced from the femoral vein through 
the  right  atrium  and  atrial  septum  at  the  level  of  the  foramen  ovale 
into  the  left  atrium.  A  guidewire  is  advanced  into  the  left  ventricle, 
and a balloon-dilatation catheter is negotiated across the mitral valve 
and  inflated  to  a  predetermined  size  to  enlarge  the  valve.  The  most 
commonly used dilatation catheter is the Inoue balloon. The technique 
splits  the  commissural  fusion  and  commonly  results  in  a  doubling 
of  the  mitral  valve  area.  The  success  of  the  procedure  in  favorable 
anatomy is 95%, and severe complications are rare (1–2%). The most 
common  complications  are  tamponade  due  to  puncture  into  the 
pericardium during the transseptal puncture or the creation of severe 
mitral regurgitation due to damage to the valve leaflets.

Severe  mitral  regurgitation  can  be  treated  percutaneously  using 
the  MitraClip  (Abbott,  Abbott  Park,  Illinois)  device.  The  procedure 
involves the passage of a catheter into the left atrium using the trans-
septal technique. A special catheter with a metallic clip on the end is 
passed through the mitral valve and retracted to catch and clip together 
the  mid  portion  of  the  anterior  and  posterior  mitral  valve  leaflets. 
The  clip  creates  a  double  opening  in  the  mitral  valve  and  thereby 
reduces  mitral  regurgitation  similar  to  the  surgical  Alfieri  repair.  In 
the  Endovascular  Valve  Edge-to-Edge  Repair  Study  (EVEREST  II)  
trial, the device was less effective than surgical repair or replacement but 
was shown to be safe. Subsequent trials have shown it to be reasonably 
effective  for  patients  who  are  not  good  candidates  for  surgical  repair, 
particularly  when  the  regurgitation  is  due  to  functional  causes.  The 
Cardiovascular  Outcomes  Assessment  of  the  MitraClip  Percutaneous 
Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation 
(COAPT) trial showed that, in patients with heart failure and functional 
mitral regurgitation who were carefully selected based on clinical and 
echocardiographic features, the procedure can reduce mortality.

Severe  aortic  stenosis  can  be  treated  with  balloon  valvuloplasty  as 
well. In this setting, the valvuloplasty balloon catheter is placed retro-
grade across the aortic valve from the femoral artery and briefly inflated 
to stretch open the valve. The success is much less favorable, with only 
50%  achieving  an  aortic  valve  area  of  >1  cm2  and  a  restenosis  rate  of 
25–50% after 6–12 months. This poor success rate has limited its use to 
patients who are not surgical candidates or as a bridge to surgery or tran-
scatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In this setting, the interme-
diate-term mortality rate of the procedure is high (10%). Repeat aortic 
valvuloplasty as a treatment for aortic valve restenosis has been reported.
Percutaneous  TAVR  has  been  shown  to  be  an  effective  treatment 
for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients and inoperable patients 
with  aortic  stenosis.  Currently,  three  valve  models,  the  Edwards 
SAPIEN  valve  (Edwards  Lifescience,  Irvine,  California),  the  CoreV-
alve ReValving system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota), and the 
Lotus  valve  (Boston  Scientific,  Natick,  Massa-
chusetts), are available. Data to date show excel-
lent durability of the valves, although long-term 
outcomes of 10 years are not yet available. The 
CoreValve and Lotus valves are self-expanding, 
whereas the Edwards valve is balloon expanded. 
The  cannulas  are  large  (14–22  French),  and 
retrograde access via the femoral artery is most 
commonly  chosen,  if  possible.  In  patients  with 
peripheral  artery  disease,  access  via  the  sub-
clavian artery, aorta, or transapically through a 
surgical incision can be used. Following balloon 
valvuloplasty,  the  valve  is  positioned  across 
the  valve  and  deployed  with  postdeployment 
balloon inflation to ensure full contact with the 
aortic  annulus.  The  success  rate  is  >90%,  and 
the  30-day  mortality  rate  is  2–15%  based  on 
preoperative risk. The Placement of Aortic Tran-
scatheter  Valve  (PARTNER)  randomized  trial 
of  the  Edwards  valve  showed  a  55%  reduction 
in 1-year mortality and major adverse events in 
the  extreme-risk  group  randomized  to  TAVR 
compared  with  medical  therapy.  In  separate 

A

randomized trials, low-, moderate-, and high-risk patients had similar 
outcomes to surgical valve replacement at 1 year. As a result, this valve 
is  approved  for  low-,  intermediate-,  high-,  and  extreme-risk  patients 
with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.

Aortic and mitral bioprosthetic valve degeneration can be treated with 
repeat surgery or, in high-risk patients, with a valve-in-valve procedure 
where a percutaneous valve is placed inside of the prior surgical valve. It 
has been shown to be effective for aortic and mitral valves.

Pulmonic stenosis can also be effectively treated with balloon val-
vuloplasty and percutaneously replaced with the Melody valve (Med-
tronic). Tricuspid valve interventions are increasingly being performed.

 ■ PERIPHERAL ARTERY INTERVENTIONS
The  use  of  percutaneous  interventions  to  treat  symptomatic  patients 
with arterial obstruction in the carotid, renal, aortic, and peripheral ves-
sels is an effective alternative to vascular surgery. Randomized clinical 
trial data support the use of carotid stenting in patients at high risk of 
complications from carotid endarterectomy (Fig. 276-4). Recent trials 
suggest similar outcomes with carotid stenting and carotid endarterec-
tomy  in  patients  at  average  risk,  although  depending  on  the  patient’s 
risk for periprocedural stroke or myocardial infarction, one procedure 
may be preferred over the other. The success rate of peripheral artery 
interventional  procedures  has  been  improving,  including  treatment 
for  long  segments  of  occlusive  disease  historically  treated  by  periph-
eral bypass surgery (Fig. 276-5). The use of drug-coated balloons and 
drug-eluting stents has shown to reduce restenosis when compared with 
balloon angioplasty alone. Peripheral intervention is increasingly part of 
the training of an interventional cardiologist, and most programs now 
require an additional year of training after the interventional cardiology 
training year. The techniques and outcomes are described in detail in 
the chapter on peripheral vascular disease (Chap. 281).

 ■ CIRCULATORY SUPPORT TECHNIQUES
The  use  of  circulatory  support  techniques  is  indicated  for  the  man-
agement of patients with shock or hemodynamic instability and occa-
sionally is needed in order to safely perform PCI on hemodynamically 
unstable patients. It also can be useful in helping to stabilize patients 
before surgical interventions. The most commonly used device is the 
percutaneous intraaortic balloon pump developed in the early 1960s. 
A 7- to 10-French, 25- to 50-mL balloon catheter is placed retrograde 
from the femoral artery into the descending aorta between the aortic 
arch and the abdominal aortic bifurcation. It is connected to a helium 
gas  inflation  system  that  synchronizes  the  inflation  to  coincide  with 
early  diastole  with  deflation  by  mid-diastole.  As  a  result,  it  increases 
early  diastolic  pressure,  lowers  systolic  pressure,  and  lowers  late  dia-
stolic  pressure  through  displacement  of  blood  from  the  descending

aorta (counterpulsation). This results in an increase in coronary blood 
flow and a decrease in afterload. It is contraindicated in patients with 
aortic  regurgitation,  aortic  dissection,  or  severe  peripheral  artery 
disease. The major complications are vascular and thrombotic. Intra-
venous heparin is given in order to reduce thrombotic complications.

Another  support  device  is  the  Impella  (Abiomed,  Danvers,  
Massachusetts). The Impella catheter is placed percutaneously from the 
femoral artery into the left ventricle. The catheter has a small microaxial 
pump at its tip that can pump up to 2.5–5 L/min from the left ventricle 
to  the  aorta.  The  smaller  devices  can  be  placed  percutaneously,  but 
the larger devices need surgical access. Other support devices include  
TandemHeart (CardiacAssist, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), which involves 
placement of a large 21-French catheter from the femoral vein through 
the  right  atrium  into  the  left  atrium  using  the  transseptal  technique 
and  a  catheter  in  the  femoral  artery.  A  centrifugal  pump  can  deliver 
5 L of blood per minute. It may be useful in patients in shock or with 
STEMI or very-high-risk PCI. Patients can also be placed on peripheral 
extracorporeal  membrane  oxygenation  (ECMO)  using  large  cannulas 
placed in the femoral artery and vein. This technique can be performed 
emergently or electively in the catheterization laboratory and is useful 
for support of patients with acute respiratory failure or cardiac failure.
 ■ INTERVENTIONS FOR PULMONARY EMBOLISM
The treatment of deep vein thrombosis is intravenous anticoagulation, 
with placement of an inferior vena cava filter if recurrent pulmonary 
emboli  (PE)  occur  or  anticoagulation  is  not  possible.  Post-phlebitic 
syndrome  is  a  serious  condition  due  to  chronic  venous  obstruction 
that can lead to chronic leg edema and venous ulcers. Randomized data 
show that mechanical treatments may have a selective role in treatment 
of large iliofemoral deep-vein thrombosis.

PE should be treated with fibrinolytic agents if massive and in some 
cases if submassive. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy is an option for 
the treatment of massive PE with hemodynamic instability in patients 
who have contraindications for systemic fibrinolysis or those in whom 
it has failed. Catheter-based therapies for submassive and massive PEs 
are  still  evolving,  but  studies  have  shown  promise.  The  techniques 
employed include the use of aspiration of the clot with a large catheter 
(10 French), intraclot infusion of a thrombolytic agent followed by aspi-
ration,  ultrasound-assisted  catheter-directed  thrombolysis,  and  use  of 
rheolytic thrombectomy. Success for these techniques has been reported 
to be 80–90%, with major complications occurring in 2–4% of patients.

 ■ INTERVENTIONS FOR REFRACTORY 
HYPERTENSION
The  recent  recognition  of  the  importance  of  the  renal  sympathetic 
nerves in modulating blood pressure has led to a technique to selec-
tively  denervate  renal  sympathetic  nerves  in  patients  with  refractory 
hypertension.  The  procedure  involves  applying  low-power  radiofre-
quency treatment via a catheter along the length of both renal arteries. 
Despite promising nonrandomized data, in the randomized Symplicity 
HTN-3  trial,  renal  denervation  did  not  significantly  reduce  blood 
pressure compared with medical therapy. Further optimization of the 
technique is ongoing with some evidence from small randomized trials 
of modest efficacy, with larger scale evaluation ongoing.

CONCLUSION
Interventional cardiology continues to expand its borders. Treatment 
for coronary artery disease, including complex anatomic subsets, con-
tinues to advance. Technological advances such as drug-eluting stents, 
now  already  in  their  second  generation,  are  improving  the  results  of 
PCI.  PCI  is  the  treatment  of  choice  for  patients  with  acute  coronary 
syndromes. For patients with stable coronary disease, PCI is effective 
in symptom alleviation. Use of a Heart Team is the best way to make 
decisions concerning which revascularization—PCI or CABG—is best 
for an individual patient. Treatment of peripheral and cerebrovascular 
disease can be effective with percutaneous techniques. Structural heart 
disease  is  increasingly  being  treated  with  percutaneous  options,  with 
interventional approaches such as TAVR becoming preferred over sur-
gical aortic valve replacement. Further growth of invasive procedures 
is anticipated in years to come.

277 Hypertension

Theodore A. Kotchen*

Hypertension is one of the leading causes of the global burden of dis-
ease. Elevated blood pressure affects more than one billion individuals 
and  causes  an  estimated  9.4  million  deaths  per  year.  Hypertension 
doubles  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  diseases,  including  coronary  heart 
disease (CHD), congestive heart failure (CHF), ischemic and hemor-
rhagic  stroke,  renal  failure,  and  peripheral  arterial  disease  (PAD).  It 
often is associated with additional cardiovascular disease risk factors, 
and the risk of cardiovascular disease increases with the total burden 
of risk factors. Although antihypertensive therapy reduces the risks of 
cardiovascular  and  renal  disease,  large  segments  of  the  hypertensive 
population are either untreated or inadequately treated.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Blood pressure levels, the rate of age-related increases in blood pres-
sure,  and  the  prevalence  of  hypertension  vary  among  countries  and 
among subpopulations within a country. Hypertension is present in all 
populations except for small numbers of individuals living in isolated 
societies.  In  industrialized  societies,  blood  pressure  increases  stead-
ily  during  the  first  two  decades  of  life.  In  children  and  adolescents, 
blood  pressure  is  associated  with  growth  and  maturation,  and  blood 
pressure “tracks” over time in children and between adolescence and 
young adulthood. In the United States, average systolic blood pressure 
is  higher  for  men  than  for  women  during  early  adulthood,  although 
among  older  individuals  the  age-related  rate  of  rise  is  steeper  for 
women. Diastolic blood pressure also increases progressively with age 
until ~55 years, after which it tends to decrease. The consequence is a 
widening  of  pulse  pressure  (the  difference  between  systolic  and  dia-
stolic blood pressure) beyond age 60.

In the United States, based on criteria for defining hypertension prior 
to  2018,  ~78  million  adults  have  hypertension.  Hypertension  preva-
lence is 33.5% in non-Hispanic blacks, 28.9% in non-Hispanic whites, 
and 20.7% in Mexican Americans. Among individuals aged ≥60 years, 
the  prevalence  is  65.4%.  Recent  evidence  suggests  that  the  prevalence 
of  hypertension  in  the  United  States  may  be  increasing,  possibly  as  a 
consequence of increasing obesity. The prevalence of hypertension and 
stroke  mortality  rates  is  higher  in  the  southeastern  United  States  than 
in other regions. In African Americans, hypertension appears earlier, is 
generally more severe, and results in higher rates of morbidity and mor-
tality from stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, CHF, and end-stage renal 
disease  (ESRD)  than  in  white  Americans.  In  the  United  States,  hyper-
tension awareness, treatment, and control rates have been improving for 
decades. According to National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) data, in 2009–2012, prevalence estimates for men and 
women, respectively, were 80.2% and 85.4% for hypertension awareness, 
70.9%  and  80.6%  for  treatment  (88.4%  and  94.4%  in  those  who  were 
aware), 69.5% and 68.5% for control in those being treated, and 49.3% 
and 55.2% for overall control in adults with hypertension.

Both environmental and genetic factors may contribute to variations 
in hypertension prevalence. Studies of societies undergoing “accultur-
ation” and studies of migrants from a less to a more urbanized setting 
indicate  a  profound  environmental  contribution  to  blood  pressure. 
Obesity and weight gain are strong, independent risk factors for hyper-
tension. Hypertension prevalence is also related to dietary NaCl intake, 
and the age-related increase in blood pressure may be augmented by 
a  high  NaCl  intake.  Low  dietary  intakes  of  calcium  and  potassium 
also may contribute to the risk of hypertension. The urine sodium-to- 
potassium ratio (an index of both sodium and potassium intakes) is a 
stronger correlate of blood pressure than is either sodium or potassium 
alone.  Alcohol  consumption,  psychosocial  stress,  and  low  levels  of 
physical activity also may contribute to hypertension.

 ■ GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS

Although  specific  genetic  variants  have  been  identified  in  rare 
Mendelian forms of hypertension, these variants are not applica-
ble to the vast majority (>98%) of patients with hypertension. For 
most individuals, it is likely that hypertension represents a polygenic 
disorder in which a combination of genes acts in concert with environ-
mental exposures to make only a modest contribution to blood pres-
sure.  Furthermore,  different  subsets  of  genes  may  lead  to  different 
phenotypes  associated  with  hypertension,  e.g.,  obesity,  dyslipidemia, 
insulin resistance.

Adoption, twin, and family studies document a significant heritable 
component to blood pressure levels and hypertension. Animal models 
(including selectively bred rats and congenic rat strains) have identi-
fied a number of genetic loci and genes associated with hypertension. 
Clinically, although replication has been a challenge, results of candi-
date gene studies and genome-wide association studies have identified 
>25  rare  mutations  and  >100  hypertension-related  polymorphisms. 
A  number  of  these  polymorphisms  are  involved  in  pathways  that 
regulate  arterial  pressure.  However,  blood  pressure–related  polymor-
phisms  account  for  only  ~3.5%  of  blood  pressure  variance,  whereas 
based on family studies, heritability of hypertension is estimated to be 
in  the  range  of  30–40%.  One  hypothesis  to  account  for  the  “missing 
heritability” is that epigenetic modifications of DNA contribute to the 
heritability of blood pressure. Epigenetic processes are changes in gene 
expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence. In contrast to 
DNA sequence, the epigenome is relatively susceptible to modification 
by environmental exposures.

Preliminary  evidence  suggests  that  there  may  also  be  genetic  and 
epigenetic determinants of target organ damage and vascular disease 
attributed to hypertension, including let ventricular hypertrophy and 
nephropathy. Specific genetic variants have been linked to CHD and 
stroke.  Additionally,  recent  studies  have  identified  specific  genome-
wide  epigenetic  modifications  of  DNA  associated  with  hypertension 
and with risk of future myocardial infarction and CHD.

MECHANISMS OF HYPERTENSION
To  provide  a  framework  for  understanding  the  pathogenesis  and 
treatment options for hypertensive disorders, it is useful to understand 
factors involved in the regulation of both normal and elevated arterial 
pressure. Cardiac output and peripheral resistance are the two deter-
minants of arterial pressure (Fig. 277-1). Cardiac output is determined 
by stroke volume and heart rate; stroke volume is related to myocardial 
contractility  and  to  the  size  of  the  vascular  compartment.  Peripheral 
resistance is determined by functional and anatomic changes in small 
arteries (lumen diameter 100–400 μm) and arterioles.
 ■ INTRAVASCULAR VOLUME
The  kidney  is  both  a  target  and  a  cause  of  hypertension.  Primary 
renal disease is the most common etiology of secondary hypertension. 
Mechanisms  of  kidney-related  hypertension  include  a  diminished 
capacity  to  excrete  sodium,  excessive  renin  secretion  in  relation  to 
volume  status,  and  sympathetic  nervous  system  overactivity.  Sodium 
is predominantly an extracellular ion and is a primary determinant of 
the extracellular fluid volume. When NaCl intake exceeds the capacity 
of the kidney to excrete sodium, vascular volume may initially expand 
and cardiac output may increase. Many vascular beds have the capacity

to autoregulate blood flow, and if constant blood flow is to be main-
tained in the face of increased arterial pressure, resistance within that 
bed must increase, since

The  initial  elevation  of  blood  pressure  in  response  to  vascular 
volume  expansion  may  be  related  to  an  increase  of  cardiac  output; 
however, over time, peripheral resistance increases and cardiac output 
reverts toward normal. Whether this hypothesized sequence of events 
occurs in the pathogenesis of hypertension is not clear. What is clear is 
that salt can activate a number of neural, endocrine/paracrine, and vas-
cular mechanisms, which have the potential to increase arterial pres-
sure. The effect of sodium on blood pressure is related to the provision 
of sodium with chloride; non-chloride salts of sodium have little or no 
effect on blood pressure. As arterial pressure increases in response to 
a  high  NaCl  intake,  urinary  sodium  excretion  increases  and  sodium 
balance  is  maintained  at  the  expense  of  an  increase  in  arterial  pres-
sure. The mechanism for this “pressure-natriuresis” phenomenon may 
involve  a  subtle  increase  in  the  glomerular  filtration  rate,  decreased 
absorbing capacity of the renal tubules, and possibly hormonal factors 
such as atrial natriuretic factor. In individuals with an impaired capac-
ity to excrete sodium, greater increases in arterial pressure are required 
to achieve natriuresis and sodium balance.

NaCl-dependent hypertension may be a consequence of a decreased 
capacity of the kidney to excrete sodium, due either to intrinsic renal dis-
ease or to increased production of a salt-retaining hormone (mineralo-
corticoid) resulting in increased renal tubular reabsorption of sodium. 
Renal tubular sodium reabsorption also may be augmented by increased 
neural activity to the kidney. In each of these situations, a higher arte-
rial pressure may be required to achieve sodium balance. Conversely, 
salt-wasting  disorders  are  associated  with  low  blood  pressure  levels. 
End  stage  renal  disease  (ESRD)  is  an  extreme  example  of  volume- 
dependent  hypertension.  In  ~80%  of  these  patients,  vascular  volume 
and hypertension can be controlled with adequate dialysis; in the other 
20%, the mechanism of hypertension is related to increased activity of the  
renin-angiotensin system and is likely to be responsive to pharmaco-
logic blockade of renin-angiotensin.
 ■ AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
Adrenergic reflexes modulate blood pressure over the short term, and 
adrenergic  function,  in  concert  with  hormonal  and  volume-related 
factors,  contributes  to  the  long-term  regulation  of  arterial  pressure. 
Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine all play important roles 
in tonic and phasic cardiovascular regulation.

The  activities  of  the  adrenergic  receptors  are  mediated  by  gua-
nosine  nucleotide-binding  regulatory  proteins  (G  proteins)  and  by 
intracellular  concentrations  of  downstream  second  messengers.  In 
addition  to  receptor  affinity  and  density,  physiologic  responsiveness 
to catecholamines may be altered by the efficiency of receptor-effector 
coupling at a site “distal” to receptor binding. Receptor sites are rela-
tively specific both for the transmitter substance and for the response 
that  occupancy  of  the  receptor  site  elicits.  Based  on  their  physiology 
and  pharmacology,  adrenergic  receptors  have  been  divided  into  two 
principal types: α and β. These types have been differentiated further 
into α1, α2, β1, and β2 receptors. Recent molecular cloning studies have 
identified  several  additional  subtypes.  α  Receptors  are  occupied  and 
activated more avidly by norepinephrine than by epinephrine, and the 
reverse is true for β receptors. α1 Receptors are located on postsynaptic 
cells  in  smooth  muscle  and  elicit  vasoconstriction.  α2  Receptors  are 
localized on presynaptic membranes of postganglionic nerve terminals 
that synthesize norepinephrine. When activated by catecholamines, α2 
receptors act as negative feedback controllers, inhibiting further nor-
epinephrine release. In the kidney, activation of α1-adrenergic receptors 
increases  renal  tubular  reabsorption  of  sodium.  Different  classes  of 
antihypertensive  agents  either  inhibit  α1  receptors  or  act  as  agonists 
of  α2  receptors  and  reduce  systemic  sympathetic  outflow.  Activation 

of myocardial β1 receptors stimulates the rate and strength of cardiac 
contraction  and  consequently  increases  cardiac  output.  β1  Receptor 
activation also stimulates renin release from the kidney. Another class 
of antihypertensive agents acts by inhibiting β1 receptors. Activation of 
β2 receptors by epinephrine relaxes vascular smooth muscle and results 
in vasodilation.

Circulating catecholamine concentrations may affect the number of 
adrenoreceptors  in  various  tissues.  Downregulation  of  receptors  may 
be a consequence of sustained high levels of catecholamines and pro-
vides an  explanation  for  decreasing  responsiveness,  or  tachyphylaxis, 
to catecholamines. For example, orthostatic hypotension is frequently 
observed in patients with pheochromocytoma, possibly due to the lack 
of  norepinephrine-induced  vasoconstriction  with  assumption  of  the 
upright posture. Conversely, with chronic reduction of neurotransmit-
ter substances, adrenoreceptors may increase in number or be upreg-
ulated, resulting in increased responsiveness to the neurotransmitter. 
Chronic administration of agents that block adrenergic receptors may 
result in upregulation, and abrupt withdrawal of those agents may pro-
duce a condition of temporary hypersensitivity to sympathetic stimuli. 
For example, clonidine is an antihypertensive agent that is a centrally 
acting α2 agonist that inhibits sympathetic outflow. Rebound hyperten-
sion may occur with the abrupt cessation of clonidine therapy, probably 
as a consequence of upregulation of α1 receptors.

Several  reflexes  modulate  blood  pressure  on  a  minute-to-minute 
basis. One arterial baroreflex is mediated by stretch-sensitive sensory 
nerve  endings  in  the  carotid  sinuses  and  the  aortic  arch.  The  rate  of 
firing of these baroreceptors increases with arterial pressure, and the 
net effect is a decrease in sympathetic outflow, resulting in decreases 
in  arterial  pressure  and  heart  rate.  This  is  a  primary  mechanism  for 
rapid  buffering  of  acute  fluctuations  of  arterial  pressure  that  may 
occur  during  postural  changes,  behavioral  or  physiologic  stress,  and 
changes  in  blood  volume.  However,  the  activity  of  the  baroreflex 
declines or adapts to sustained increases in arterial pressure such that 
the  baroreceptors  are  reset  to  higher  pressures.  Baroreflex  control  of 
blood  pressure  deteriorates  with  advancing  age,  hypertension,  and 
atherosclerosis.  The  consequences  are  increased  blood  pressure  vari-
ability and an increased incidence of orthostatic hypotension. Patients 
with  autonomic  neuropathy  and  impaired  baroreflex  function  may 
have extremely labile blood pressures with difficult-to-control episodic 
blood pressure spikes associated with tachycardia.

In  both  normal-weight  and  obese  individuals,  hypertension  often 
is associated with increased sympathetic outflow. Based on recordings 
of postganglionic muscle nerve activity (detected by a microelectrode 
inserted  in  a  peroneal  nerve  in  the  leg),  sympathetic  outflow  tends 
to be higher in hypertensive than in normotensive individuals. Sym-
pathetic  outflow  is  increased  in  obesity-related  hypertension  and  in 
hypertension  associated  with  obstructive  sleep  apnea.  Baroreceptor 
activation  via  electrical  stimulation  of  carotid  sinus  afferent  nerves 
lowers blood pressure in patients with “resistant” hypertension. Drugs 
that block the sympathetic nervous system are potent antihypertensive 
agents, indicating that the sympathetic nervous system plays a permis-
sive, although not necessarily a causative, role in the maintenance of 
increased arterial pressure.

Pheochromocytoma  is  the  most  blatant  example  of  hypertension 
related  to  increased  catecholamine  production,  in  this  instance  by  a 
tumor. Blood pressure can be reduced by surgical excision of the tumor 
or by pharmacologic treatment with an α1 receptor antagonist or with 
an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in catecho-
lamine biosynthesis.
 ■ RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE
The  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system  contributes  to  the  regula-
tion  of  arterial  pressure  primarily  via  the  vasoconstrictor  properties 
of angiotensin II and the sodium-retaining properties of aldosterone. 
Renin  is  an  aspartyl  protease  that  is  synthesized  as  an  enzymatically 
inactive  precursor,  prorenin.  Most  renin  in  the  circulation  is  synthe-
sized  in  the  renal  afferent  renal  arteriole.  Prorenin  may  be  secreted 
directly into the circulation or may be activated within secretory cells

2074 and released as active renin. There are three primary stimuli for renin 
secretion:  (1)  decreased  NaCl  transport  in  the  distal  portion  of  the 
thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle that abuts the corresponding 
afferent  arteriole  (macula  densa),  (2)  decreased  pressure  or  stretch 
within the renal afferent arteriole (baroreceptor mechanism), and (3) 
sympathetic nervous system stimulation of renin-secreting cells via β1 
adrenoreceptors. Conversely, renin secretion is inhibited by increased 
NaCl  transport  in  the  thick  ascending  limb  of  the  loop  of  Henle,  by 
increased stretch within the renal afferent arteriole, and by β1 receptor 
blockade. In addition, angiotensin II directly inhibits renin secretion 
due  to  angiotensin  II  type  1  receptors  on  juxtaglomerular  cells,  and 
renin  secretion  increases  in  response  to  pharmacologic  blockade  of 
either the angiotensin-converting enzyme or angiotensin II receptors.
Once released into the circulation, active renin cleaves a substrate, 
angiotensinogen,  to  form  an  inactive  decapeptide,  angiotensin  I  
(Fig.  277-2).  A  converting  enzyme,  located  primarily  but  not  exclu-
sively  in  the  pulmonary  circulation,  converts  angiotensin  I  to  the 
active octapeptide, angiotensin II, by releasing the C-terminal histidyl- 
leucine  dipeptide.  The  same  converting  enzyme  cleaves  a  number 
of  other  peptides,  including  and  thereby  inactivating  the  vasodilator 
bradykinin. Acting primarily through angiotensin II type 1 receptors 
(AT1R) on cell membranes, angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance 
and  is  the  primary  trophic  factor  for  the  secretion  of  aldosterone  by 
the  adrenal  zona  glomerulosa.  Utilizing  various  signal  transduction 
cascades, the AT1R is believed to mediate most functions of angiotensin 
II,  resulting  in  hypertension,  cardiovascular  remodeling,  and  end- 
organ  damage.  The  angiotensin  II  type  2  receptor  (AT2R)  has  the 
opposite functional effects of the AT1R. The AT2R induces vasodilation, 
sodium excretion, and inhibition of cell growth and matrix formation. 
The  AT2R  may  improve  vascular  remodeling  by  stimulating  smooth 
muscle cell apoptosis and contributes to the regulation of glomerular 
filtration rate. AT1R blockade induces an increase in AT2R activity.

Renin-secreting  tumors  are  clear  examples  of  renin-dependent 
hypertension. In the kidney, these tumors include benign hemangio-
pericytomas of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and, infrequently, renal 
carcinomas,  including  Wilms’  tumors.  Renin-producing  carcinomas 
also have been described in lung, liver, pancreas, colon, and adrenals. 
Renovascular hypertension is another renin-mediated form of hyper-
tension.  Obstruction  of  the  renal  artery  leads  to  decreased  renal

perfusion  pressure,  thereby  stimulating  renin  secretion.  Over  time, 
possibly  as  a  consequence  of  secondary  renal  damage,  this  form  of 
hypertension may become less renin-dependent.

Angiotensinogen,  renin,  and  angiotensin  II  are  also  synthesized 
locally  in  many  tissues,  including  the  brain,  pituitary,  aorta,  arteries, 
heart, adrenal glands, kidneys, adipocytes, leukocytes, ovaries, testes, 
uterus, spleen, and skin. Angiotensin II in tissues may be formed by 
the enzymatic activity of renin or by other proteases, e.g., tonin, chy-
mase, and cathepsins. In addition to regulating local blood flow, tissue 
angiotensin  II  is  a  mitogen  that  stimulates  growth  and  contributes 
to  modeling  and  repair.  Excess  tissue  angiotensin  II  may  contribute 
to  atherosclerosis,  cardiac  hypertrophy,  and  renal  failure  and,  conse-
quently, may be a target for pharmacologic therapy to prevent target 
organ damage.

Angiotensin II is the primary tropic factor regulating the synthesis 
and  secretion  of  aldosterone  by  the  zona  glomerulosa  of  the  adrenal 
cortex.  Aldosterone  synthesis  is  also  dependent  on  potassium,  and 
aldosterone  secretion  may  be  decreased  in  potassium-depleted  indi-
viduals.  Although  acute  elevations  of  adrenocorticotropic  hormone 
(ACTH)  levels  also  increase  aldosterone  secretion,  ACTH  is  not  an 
important trophic factor for the chronic regulation of aldosterone.

Aldosterone  is  a  potent  mineralocorticoid  that  increases  sodium 
reabsorption by amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) 
on the apical surface of the principal cells of the renal cortical collect-
ing duct (Chap. 309). Electric neutrality is maintained by exchanging 
sodium  for  potassium  and  hydrogen  ions.  Consequently,  increased 
aldosterone  secretion  may  result  in  hypokalemia  and  alkalosis.  Cor-
tisol also binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor but normally func-
tions  as  a  less  potent  mineralocorticoid  than  aldosterone  because 
cortisol is converted to cortisone by the enzyme 11 β-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase type 2. Cortisone has no affinity for the mineralocor-
ticoid  receptor.  Primary  aldosteronism  is  a  compelling  example  of  
mineralocorticoid-mediated  hypertension.  In  this  disorder,  adrenal 
aldosterone  synthesis  and  release  are  independent  of  renin-angiotensin, 
and renin release is suppressed by the resulting volume expansion.

Mineralocorticoid  receptors  are  expressed  in  a  number  of  tissues 
in  addition  to  the  kidney,  and  mineralocorticoid  receptor  activation 
induces  structural  and  functional  alterations  in  the  heart,  kidney, 
and  blood  vessels,  leading  to  myocardial  fibrosis  and  left  ventricular 
hypertrophy, nephrosclerosis, and vascular inflammation and remod-
eling,  perhaps  as  a  consequence  of  oxidative  stress.  These  effects  are 
amplified  by  a  high  salt  intake.  In  animal  models,  spironolactone 
(an aldosterone antagonist) prevents aldosterone-induced myocardial 
fibrosis.  In  patients  with  CHF,  low-dose  spironolactone  reduces  the 
risk of progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes 
by 30%. Due to a renal hemodynamic effect, in patients with primary 
aldosteronism,  high  circulating  levels  of  aldosterone  also  may  cause 
glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria.

Increased  activity  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  axis  is  not 
invariably associated with hypertension. In response to a low-NaCl diet 
or  to  volume  contraction,  arterial  pressure  and  volume  homeostasis 
may  be  maintained  by  increased  activity  of  the  renin-angiotensin- 
aldosterone axis. Secondary aldosteronism (i.e., increased aldosterone 
secondary to increased renin-angiotensin), but not hypertension, also 
is observed in edematous states such as CHF and liver disease.

 ■ VASCULAR MECHANISMS
Vascular  radius  and  compliance  of  resistance  arteries  are  important 
determinants  of  arterial  pressure.  Resistance  to  flow  varies  inversely 
with the fourth power of the radius, and consequently, small decreases 
in  lumen  size  significantly  increase  resistance.  In  hypertensive 
patients, structural, mechanical, or functional changes may reduce the 
lumen diameter of small arteries and arterioles. Remodeling refers to  
geometric  alterations  in  the  vessel  wall  without  a  change  in  vessel 
volume.  Hypertrophic  (increased  cell  size  and  increased  deposition 
of  intercellular  matrix)  or  eutrophic  vascular  remodeling  results  in 
decreased  lumen  size  and,  hence,  increased  peripheral  resistance. 
Apoptosis,  low-grade  inflammation,  and  vascular  fibrosis  also  con-
tribute  to  remodeling.  Lumen  diameter  also  is  related  to  elasticity  of

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemthe vessel. Vessels with a high degree of elasticity can accommodate an 
increase of volume with relatively little change in pressure, whereas in 
a semi-rigid vascular system, a small increment in volume induces a 
relatively large increment of pressure.

An  association  between  arterial  stiffness  and  hypertension  is  well 
established.  A  stiffened  vasculature  is  less  able  to  buffer  short-term 
alterations in flow. Although it has been assumed that arterial stiffness 
is a manifestation of hypertension, recent evidence suggests that vascu-
lar stiffness may also contribute to elevated arterial pressure. Clinically, 
noninvasive determination of elevated pulse wave velocity between the 
carotid and femoral arteries is often interpreted as an indicator of arte-
rial stiffness. Due to arterial stiffness, central blood pressures (aortic, 
carotid) may not correspond to brachial artery pressures. Ejection of 
blood into the aorta elicits a pressure wave that is propagated at a given 
velocity.  The  forward  traveling  wave  generates  a  reflected  wave  that 
travels backward toward the ascending aorta. Although mean arterial 
pressure  is  determined  by  cardiac  output  and  peripheral  resistance, 
pulse  pressure  is  related  to  the  functional  properties  of  large  arteries 
and  the  amplitude  and  timing  of  the  incident  and  reflected  waves. 
Increased arterial stiffness results in increased pulse wave velocity of 
both incident and reflected waves. The consequence is augmentation 
of aortic systolic pressure and a reduction of aortic diastolic pressure, 
i.e.,  an  increase  in  pulse  pressure.  The  aortic  augmentation  index,  a 
surrogate index of arterial stiffening, is calculated as the ratio of central 
arterial pressure to pulse pressure. However, wave reflections are also 
influenced  by  left  ventricular  structure  and  function.  Central  blood 
pressure  may  be  measured  directly  by  placing  a  sensor  in  the  aorta 
or noninvasively by radial tonometry. Central blood pressure and the 
aortic augmentation index are independent predictors of cardiovascu-
lar disease and all-cause mortality. Central blood pressure also appears 
to  be  more  strongly  associated  with  preclinical  organ  damage  than 
brachial blood pressure.

Ion  transport  by  vascular  smooth  muscle  cells  may  contribute  to 
hypertension-associated  abnormalities  of  vascular  tone  and  vascular 
growth, both of which are modulated by intracellular pH (pHi). Three 
ion  transport  mechanisms  participate  in  the  regulation  of  pHi:  (1) 
Na+-H+ exchange, (2) Na+-dependent HCO3
–-Cl– exchange, and (3) cation- 
–-Cl–  exchange.  Based  on  measurements  in  cell 
independent  HCO3
types that are more accessible than vascular smooth muscle (e.g., leu-
kocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, skeletal muscle), activity of the Na+-H+ 
exchanger is increased in hypertension, and this may result in increased 
vascular tone by two mechanisms. First, increased sodium entry may 
lead  to  increased  vascular  tone  by  activating  Na+-Ca2+  exchange 
and  thereby  increasing  intracellular  calcium.  Second,  increased  pHi 
enhances calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, leading to an 
increase in contractility for a given intracellular calcium concentration. 
Additionally, increased Na+-H+ exchange may stimulate growth of vas-
cular smooth muscle cells by enhancing sensitivity to mitogens.

Vascular  endothelial  function  also  modulates  vascular  tone.  The 
vascular  endothelium  synthesizes  and  releases  several  vasoactive 
substances, including nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. Endothelium- 
dependent  vasodilation  is  impaired  in  hypertensive  patients.  This 
impairment  often  is  assessed  with  high-resolution  ultrasonography 
before  and  after  the  hyperemic  phase  of  reperfusion  that  follows 
5  min  of  forearm  ischemia.  Alternatively,  endothelium-dependent 
vasodilation may be assessed in response to an intra-arterially infused 
endothelium-dependent  vasodilator,  e.g.,  acetylcholine.  Endothelin  is 
a  vasoconstrictor  peptide  produced  by  the  endothelium,  and  orally 
active  endothelin  antagonists  may  lower  blood  pressure  in  patients 
with resistant hypertension.

 ■ IMMUNE MECHANISMS, INFLAMMATION, AND 
OXIDATIVE STRESS
Low-grade inflammation and uncontrolled activation of the immune 
system have been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular injury and 
hypertension  for  at  least  four  decades.  Both  thymus-derived  cells  (T 
cells) and bone marrow– or bursa-derived cells (B cells) are involved. 
Activation has been attributed to increased sympathetic nervous sys-
tem activity, mechanical forces in the vascular wall, interstitial sodium

concentration,  and  a  high  salt  intake.  Inflammatory  cytokines  and 
free  radicals  secreted  by  activated  immune  cells  may  contribute  to 
vascular  and  target  organ  injury.  Inflammation  and  exudative  injury 
are closely coupled. Inflammation, vascular stretch, angiotensin II, and 
salt have all been shown to result in the generation of reactive oxygen 
species  (ROS),  which  modify  T-cell  function  and  further  enhance 
inflammation.  ROS  also  attenuate  the  effects  of  endogenous  small- 
molecule  vasodilators.  Preliminary  evidence  suggests  that  hyperten-
sion  is  blunted  and  vascular  endothelial  function  is  preserved  in 
experimental  models  that  lack  both  T  cells  and  B  cells.  In  animal 
models  of  salt-sensitive  hypertension,  salt-related  increases  in  renal 
perfusion pressure induce the infiltration of immune cells into the kid-
ney. The infiltrating cells release cytokines and free radicals that may 
contribute to renal injury. Additionally, ROS within the renal medulla 
may  disrupt  pressure-natriuresis  and  thereby  potentiate  the  develop-
ment of hypertension.

Clinically,  patients  with  primary  hypertension  have  increased  cir-
culating levels of autoantibodies, and markers of oxidative stress have 
been described in both hypertensive and prehypertensive individuals. 
Increased numbers of activated immune cells (either in the circulation 
or tissue biopsies) and the inflammatory cytokines they produce also 
occur in patients with preeclampsia, resistant hypertension, malignant 
hypertension, and renal allograft rejection.

PATHOLOGIC CONSEQUENCES OF 
HYPERTENSION
 ■ HEART
Heart  disease  is  the  most  common  cause  of  death  in  hypertensive 
patients. Hypertensive heart disease is the result of structural and func-
tional  adaptations  leading  to  left  ventricular  hypertrophy,  increased 
atrial size, CHF, atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, microvascular 
disease, and cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. Indepen-
dent  of  blood  pressure,  individuals  with  left  ventricular  hypertrophy 
are at increased risk for CHD, stroke, CHF, and sudden death. Control 
of hypertension can regress or reverse left ventricular hypertrophy and 
reduce  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease.  Coronary  artery  calcium 
score  provides  a  noninvasive  estimate  of  target  organ  injury  and  is 
associated with cardiovascular events. However, there is currently rel-
atively little information regarding the impact of improvement of this 
subclinical marker on prognosis.

CHF may be related to systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, 
or a combination of the two. Abnormalities of diastolic function that 
range from asymptomatic heart disease to overt heart failure are com-
mon in hypertensive patients. Approximately one-third of patients with 
CHF  have  normal  systolic  function  but  abnormal  diastolic  function. 
Diastolic dysfunction is an early consequence of hypertension-related 
heart  disease  and  is  exacerbated  by  left  ventricular  hypertrophy  and 
ischemia.  Cardiac  catheterization  provides  the  most  accurate  assess-
ment  of  diastolic  function.  Alternatively,  diastolic  function  can  be 
evaluated by several noninvasive methods, including echocardiography 
and radionuclide angiography.

 ■ BRAIN
Stroke  is  the  second  most  frequent  cause  of  death  in  the  world;  it 
accounts  for  5  million  deaths  each  year,  with  an  additional  15  mil-
lion  persons  having  nonfatal  strokes.  Elevated  blood  pressure  is  the 
strongest risk factor for stroke. Approximately 85% of strokes are due 
to infarction, and the remainder are due to either intracerebral or sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage. The incidence of stroke rises progressively with 
increasing blood pressure levels, particularly systolic blood pressure in 
individuals  aged  >65  years.  Treatment  of  hypertension  decreases  the 
incidence of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.

Hypertension is also associated with impaired cognition in an aging 
population,  and  longitudinal  studies  support  an  association  between 
midlife hypertension and late-life cognitive decline. Vascular dementia 
and Alzheimer’s disease often coexist. Hypertension is associated with 
beta  amyloid  deposition,  a  major  pathologic  factor  in  dementia.  In 
addition to actual blood pressure level, arterial stiffness and visit-to-visit 

HPIM21e_Part6_p1797-p2130.indd   2075

2076 blood pressure variability may be independently related to subclinical 
small vessel disease and subsequent cognitive decline. Hypertension-re-
lated  cognitive  impairment  and  dementia  may  also  be  a  consequence 
of a single infarct due to occlusion of a “strategic” larger vessel or mul-
tiple lacunar infarcts due to occlusive small vessel disease resulting in 
subcortical  white  matter  ischemia.  Several  clinical  trials  suggest  that 
antihypertensive therapy has a beneficial effect on cognitive function.

Cerebral blood flow remains unchanged over a wide range of arterial 
pressures (mean arterial pressure of 50–150 mmHg) through a process 
termed autoregulation of blood flow. In patients with the clinical syn-
drome of malignant hypertension, encephalopathy is related to failure 
of  autoregulation  of  cerebral  blood  flow  at  the  upper  pressure  limit, 
resulting in vasodilation and hyperperfusion. Signs and symptoms of 
hypertensive  encephalopathy  may  include  severe  headache,  nausea 
and vomiting (often of a projectile nature), focal neurologic signs, and 
alterations  in  mental  status.  Untreated,  hypertensive  encephalopathy 
may  progress  to  stupor,  coma,  seizures,  and  death  within  hours.  It 
is  important  to  distinguish  hypertensive  encephalopathy  from  other 
neurologic syndromes that may be associated with hypertension, e.g., 
cerebral ischemia, hemorrhagic or thrombotic stroke, seizure disorder, 
mass  lesions,  pseudotumor  cerebri,  delirium  tremens,  meningitis, 
acute intermittent porphyria, traumatic or chemical injury to the brain, 
and uremic encephalopathy.

 ■ KIDNEY
Hypertension is a risk factor for renal injury and ESRD. The increased 
risk  associated  with  high  blood  pressure  is  graded,  continuous,  and 
present  throughout  the  distribution  of  blood  pressure  above  optimal 
pressure. Renal risk appears to be more closely related to systolic than 
to diastolic blood pressure, and black men are at greater risk than white 
men for developing ESRD at every level of blood pressure.

Atherosclerotic, hypertension-related vascular lesions in the kidney 
primarily affect preglomerular arterioles, resulting in ischemic changes 
in the glomeruli and postglomerular structures. Glomerular injury also 
may be a consequence of direct damage to the glomerular capillaries 
due to glomerular hyperperfusion. With progressive renal injury, there 
is a loss of autoregulation of renal blood flow, resulting in a lower blood 
pressure threshold for renal damage and a steeper slope between blood 
pressure and renal damage. The result may be a vicious cycle of renal 
damage and nephron loss leading to more severe hypertension, glom-
erular  hyperfiltration,  and  further  renal  damage.  Glomerular  pathol-
ogy progresses to glomerulosclerosis, and eventually the renal tubules 
may  also  become  ischemic  and  gradually  atrophic.  The  renal  lesion 
associated with malignant hypertension consists of fibrinoid necrosis 
of  the  afferent  arterioles,  sometimes  extending  into  the  glomerulus, 
and may result in focal necrosis of the glomerular tuft.

Clinically,  macroalbuminuria  (a  random  urine  albumin/creatinine 
ratio  >300  mg/g)  and  microalbuminuria  (a  random  urine  albumin/
creatinine ratio 30–300 mg/g) are early markers of renal injury. They are 
also risk factors for renal disease progression and cardiovascular disease.

 ■ PERIPHERAL ARTERIES
Blood  vessels  are  a  target  organ  atherosclerotic  disease  secondary  to 
long-standing elevated blood pressure. Independent of blood pressure, 
arterial stiffness (measured as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity or 
carotid pulse pressure) is associated with target organ disease, includ-
ing stroke, heart disease, and renal failure. Hypertensive patients with 
arterial  disease  of  the  lower  extremities  are  also  at  increased  risk  of 
future  cardiovascular  disease.  Clinically,  PAD  may  be  recognized  by 
the symptom of claudication. The ankle-brachial index (ratio of ankle 
to brachial systolic blood pressure) is a useful approach for evaluating 
peripheral arterial disease. An ankle-brachial index <0.90 is considered 
diagnostic of PAD and is associated with >50% stenosis in at least one 
major  lower  limb  vessel.  An  ankle-brachial  index  <0.80  is  associated 
with elevated blood pressure, particularly systolic blood pressure.

Whether  arterial  stiffness  and  vascular  remodeling  are  primary 
alterations  or  secondary  consequences  of  elevated  arterial  pressure 
remains  to  be  established.  Limited  evidence  suggests  that  vascu-
lar  compliance  and  endothelium-dependent  vasodilation  may  be 

improved by aerobic exercise, weight loss, and antihypertensive agents. 
It remains to be determined whether these interventions affect arterial 
structure and stiffness via a blood pressure–independent mechanism 
and whether different classes of antihypertensive agents preferentially 
affect vascular structure and function.

DEFINING HYPERTENSION
From an epidemiologic perspective, there is no obvious level of blood 
pressure  that  defines  hypertension.  In  adults,  there  is  a  continuous, 
incremental  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease,  stroke,  and  renal  disease 
across levels of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The Multiple 
Risk  Factor  Intervention  Trial  (MRFIT),  which  included  >350,000 
male participants, demonstrated a continuous and graded influence of 
both systolic and diastolic blood pressure on CHD mortality, extending 
down  to  systolic  blood  pressures  of  120  mmHg.  Similarly,  results  of 
a  meta-analysis  involving  almost  1  million  participants  indicate  that 
ischemic heart disease mortality, stroke mortality, and mortality from 
other  vascular  causes  are  directly  related  to  the  height  of  the  blood 
pressure, beginning at 115/75 mmHg, without evidence of a threshold. 
Cardiovascular  disease  risk  doubles  for  every  20-mmHg  increase  in 
systolic  and  10-mmHg  increase  in  diastolic  pressure.  Among  older 
individuals, systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are more power-
ful predictors of cardiovascular disease than is diastolic blood pressure.
Clinically, hypertension may be defined as that level of blood pres-
sure at which the institution of therapy reduces blood pressure–related 
morbidity  and  mortality.  Clinical  criteria  for  defining  hypertension 
generally have been based on the average of two or more seated blood 
pressure  readings  during  each  of  two  or  more  outpatient  visits.  One 
recent  classification  recommends  hypertension  be  defined  as  systolic 
blood  pressure  ≥130  mmHg  or  diastolic  blood  pressure  ≥80  mmHg 
(Table  277-1).  In  contrast,  previous  guidelines  defined  hypertension 
as  systolic  blood  pressure  ≥140  mmHg  or  diastolic  blood  pressure  
≥90  mmHg.  Compared  to  the  earlier  definition,  based  on  the  new 
definition,  the  prevalence  of  hypertension  among  U.S.  adults  is  sub-
stantially  higher  (46  vs  32%).  In  children  and  adolescents,  hyperten-
sion  is  generally  defined  as  systolic  and/or  diastolic  blood  pressure 
consistently >95th percentile for age, sex, and height. Blood pressures 
between the 90th and 95th percentiles are considered prehypertensive 
and are an indication for lifestyle interventions.

Out-of-office  measurement  of  blood  pressure  can  be  helpful  for 
confirmation  and  management  of  hypertension.  Ambulatory  moni-
tors are usually programmed to obtain blood pressure readings every 
15–30 min throughout the day and every 15–60 min during the night. 
Although  ambulatory  monitoring  is  generally  accepted  as  the  best 
out-of-office measurement, home blood pressure monitoring with less 
frequent measures is a more practical approach. Because ambulatory 
blood pressure recordings yield multiple readings throughout the day 
and night, they provide a more comprehensive assessment of the vas-
cular burden of hypertension than do a limited number of office read-
ings. Home blood pressures, including 24-h blood pressure recordings, 
more reliably predict target organ damage than do usual office blood 
pressures. Nighttime blood pressures are generally 10–20% lower than 
daytime blood pressures, and an attenuated nighttime blood pressure 
“dip” is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Less well

established,  the  rate  of  rise  of  blood  pressure  in  the  early  morning 
(blood  pressure  “surge”)  may  also  predict  a  higher  risk  of  cardiovas-
cular events.

Home blood pressure and average 24-h ambulatory blood pressure 
measurements are generally lower than clinic blood pressures. Recent 
guidelines  provide  values  of  home  and  ambulatory  blood  pressure 
monitoring  that  correspond  to  office-measured  blood  pressures. 
Approximately 15–20% of patients with elevated office blood pressures 
have normal ambulatory readings, a phenomenon termed “white coat 
hypertension.”  Long-term  outcomes  of  individuals  with  white  coat 
hypertension  are  more  similar  to  normotensive  individuals  than  to 
individuals with sustained hypertension (elevation of both office and 
out-of-office  blood  pressures).  In  contrast,  “masked  hypertension” 
(normal  office  blood  pressure  and  elevated  out-of-office  blood  pres-
sure) is associated with a risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause 
mortality  twice  that  of  normotensive  individuals,  with  a  risk  range 
similar to that of patients with sustained hypertension. In population- 
based  surveys,  the  prevalence  of  masked  hypertension  varies  from  
10 to 30%.

CLINICAL DISORDERS OF HYPERTENSION
Depending on methods of patient ascertainment, ~80–95% of hyper-
tensive  patients  are  diagnosed  as  having  primary,  or  “essential,” 
hypertension  (inclusive  of  patients  with  obesity  and  the  metabolic 
syndrome).  In  the  remaining  5–20%  of  hypertensive  patients,  an 
underlying  disorder  causing  the  elevation  of  blood  pressure  can  be 
identified (Tables 277-2 and 277-3). In individuals with “secondary”

hypertension,  a  specific  mechanism  for  the  blood  pressure  elevation 
is  often  more  apparent.  Clues  to  secondary  hypertension  include 
characteristic  clinical  features,  severe  or  drug-resistant  hypertension, 
recent  onset  of  hypertension,  disproportionate  target  organ  damage, 
and younger age.

 ■ PRIMARY HYPERTENSION
Primary hypertension tends to be familial and is likely to be the con-
sequence  of  an  interaction  between  environmental  and  genetic  fac-
tors. The prevalence of primary hypertension increases with age, and 
individuals with relatively high blood pressures at younger ages are at 
increased  risk  for  the  subsequent  development  of  hypertension.  It  is 
likely  that  primary  hypertension  represents  a  spectrum  of  disorders 
with different underlying pathophysiologies. In the majority of patients 
with  established  hypertension,  peripheral  resistance  is  increased  and 
cardiac  output  is  normal  or  decreased;  however,  in  younger  patients 
with  mild  or  labile  hypertension,  cardiac  output  may  be  increased 
and peripheral resistance may be normal. When plasma renin activity 
(PRA)  is  plotted  against  24-h  sodium  excretion,  ~10–15%  of  hyper-
tensive  patients  have  high  PRA,  and  25%  have  low  PRA.  High-renin 
patients  may  have  a  vasoconstrictor  form  of  hypertension,  whereas 
low-renin  patients  may  have  volume-dependent  hypertension.  Com-
pared to other U.S. populations, African Americans have a high preva-
lence of hypertension and hypertension-related cardiovascular disease 
and  renal  morbidity  and  mortality.  Hypertensive  African  Americans 
tend to have low plasma renin and volume-dependent hypertension.

 ■ OBESITY AND THE METABOLIC SYNDROME
(See  also  Chap.  408)  Sixty  percent  of  hypertensive  adults  are  >20% 
overweight, and there is a well-documented association between obe-
sity  (body  mass  index  >30  kg/m2)  and  hypertension.  Cross-sectional 
studies  document  a  direct  linear  correlation  between  body  weight 
(or body mass index) and blood pressure. Centrally located body fat 
is  a  more  important  determinant  of  blood  pressure  elevation  than  is 
peripheral body fat.

Hypertension  and  dyslipidemia  frequently  occur  together  and  in 
association with resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. This 
clustering  of  risk  factors  is  often,  but  not  invariably,  associated  with 
obesity, particularly abdominal obesity. Insulin resistance also is asso-
ciated with an unfavorable imbalance in the endothelial production of 
mediators that regulate platelet aggregation, coagulation, fibrinolysis, 
and  vessel  tone.  When  these  risk  factors  cluster,  the  risks  for  CHD, 
stroke,  diabetes,  and  cardiovascular  disease  mortality  are  increased 
further.

Depending  on  the  populations  studied  and  the  methodologies 
for  defining  insulin  resistance,  ~25–50%  of  nonobese,  nondiabetic 
hypertensive persons are insulin resistant. The constellation of insulin 
resistance, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia has been 
designated as the metabolic syndrome. First-degree relatives of patients 
with  primary  hypertension  are  also  insulin  resistant,  and  hyperin-
sulinemia  (a  surrogate  marker  of  insulin  resistance)  may  predict  the 
eventual development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. An 
antinatriuretic  effect  of  insulin  may  contribute  to  the  development 
of  hypertension.  Although  the  metabolic  syndrome  may  in  part  be 
heritable as a polygenic condition, the expression of the syndrome is 
modified by environmental factors, such as degree of physical activity 
and diet. Insulin sensitivity increases and blood pressure decreases in 
response  to  weight  loss.  The  recognition  that  cardiovascular  disease 
risk  factors  tend  to  cluster  within  individuals  has  important  impli-
cations  for  the  evaluation  and  treatment  of  hypertension.  Evaluation 
of  both  hypertensive  patients  and  individuals  at  risk  for  developing 
hypertension should include assessment of overall cardiovascular dis-
ease risk. Similarly, introduction of lifestyle modification strategies and 
drug therapies should address overall risk and not focus exclusively on 
hypertension.

 ■ RENAL PARENCHYMAL DISEASES
Virtually  all  disorders  of  the  kidney  may  cause  hypertension,  and 
renal  disease  is  the  most  common  cause  of  secondary  hypertension.

2078 Hypertension is present in >80% of patients with chronic renal failure. 
In general, hypertension is more severe in glomerular diseases than in 
interstitial diseases such as chronic pyelonephritis. Conversely, hyper-
tension may cause nephrosclerosis, and in some instances, it may be 
difficult to determine whether hypertension or renal disease was the 
initial disorder. Proteinuria >1000 mg/d and an active urine sediment 
are indicative of primary renal disease. In either instance, the goals are 
to  control  blood  pressure  and  retard  the  rate  of  progression  of  renal 
dysfunction.

 ■ RENOVASCULAR HYPERTENSION
Hypertension due to an occlusive lesion of a renal artery, renovascu-
lar  hypertension,  is  a  potentially  curable  form  of  hypertension.  Two 
groups  of  patients  are  at  risk  for  this  disorder:  older  arteriosclerotic 
patients  who  have  a  plaque  obstructing  the  renal  artery,  frequently 
at  its  origin,  and  patients  with  fibromuscular  dysplasia.  Atheroscle-
rosis  accounts  for  the  large  majority  of  patients  with  renovascular 
hypertension.  Although  fibromuscular  dysplasia  may  occur  at  any 
age, it has a strong predilection for young white women. The lesions 
of fibromuscular dysplasia are frequently bilateral and, in contrast to 
atherosclerotic renovascular disease, tend to affect more distal portions 
of the renal artery.

Renovascular  hypertension  should  be  considered  in  patients  with 
other evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Severe or refractory 
hypertension,  recent  loss  of  hypertension  control  or  recent  onset  of 
moderately severe hypertension, carotid or femoral artery bruits, flash 
pulmonary edema, and unexplained deterioration of renal function or 
deterioration of renal function associated with an angiotensin-converting 
enzyme  inhibitor  (ACEI)  should  raise  the  possibility  of  renovascular 
hypertension. Approximately 50% of patients with renovascular hyper-
tension have an abdominal or flank bruit, and the bruit is more likely to 
be hemodynamically significant if it lateralizes or extends throughout 
systole into diastole.

If  renal  artery  stenosis  is  suspected  and  if  the  clinical  condition 
warrants  an  intervention  such  as  percutaneous  transluminal  renal 
angioplasty  (PTRA),  placement  of  a  vascular  endoprosthesis  (stent), 
or surgical renal revascularization, imaging studies should be the next 
step  in  the  evaluation.  Doppler  ultrasound  of  the  renal  arteries  pro-
duces reliable estimates of renal blood flow and offers the opportunity 
to  track  a  lesion  over  time.  Positive  studies  usually  are  confirmed  at 
angiography,  whereas  false-negative  results  occur  frequently,  partic-
ularly  in  obese  patients.  Gadolinium-contrast  magnetic  resonance 
angiography offers clear images of the proximal renal artery but may 
miss distal lesions. An advantage is the opportunity to image the renal 
arteries with an agent that is not nephrotoxic. Contrast arteriography 
remains the “gold standard” for evaluation and identification of renal 
artery lesions.

Some degree of renal artery obstruction may be observed in almost 
50%  of  patients  with  atherosclerotic  disease,  and  there  are  several 
approaches for evaluating the functional significance of such a lesion 
to predict the effect of vascular repair on blood pressure control and 
renal function. Functionally significant lesions generally occlude >70% 
of the lumen of the affected renal artery. On angiography, the presence 
of  collateral  vessels  to  the  ischemic  kidney  suggests  a  functionally 
significant  lesion.  A  lateralizing  renal  vein  renin  ratio  (ratio  >1.5  of 
affected side/contralateral side) has a 90% predictive value for a lesion 
that would respond to vascular repair; however, the false-negative rate 
for blood pressure control is 50–60%.

A decision concerning vascular repair versus medical therapy and 
the  type  of  repair  procedure  should  be  individualized.  Several  ran-
domized clinical trials have found that PTRA with stent placement in 
patients with arteriosclerotic renal artery stenosis offers no advantages 
to medical therapy in controlling blood pressure, reducing cardiovas-
cular  events  and  mortality,  or  preserving  kidney  function.  If  blood 
pressure is adequately controlled with medical therapy and renal func-
tion remains stable, there may be little impetus to pursue an extensive 
evaluation for renal artery stenosis. Patients with long-standing hyperten-
sion, advanced renal insufficiency, or diabetes mellitus are less likely to 
benefit from renal vascular repair. Patients with fibromuscular disease 

have  more  favorable  outcomes  with  vascular  repair  than  do  patients 
with  atherosclerotic  lesions,  presumably  owing  to  their  younger  age, 
shorter duration of hypertension, and less systemic disease. The most 
effective  medical  therapies  for  renovascular  hypertension  include  an 
ACE  inhibitor  or  an  angiotensin  II  receptor  blocker;  however,  these 
agents decrease glomerular filtration rate in a stenotic kidney owing to 
efferent renal arteriolar dilation. In the presence of bilateral renal artery 
stenosis or renal artery stenosis to a solitary kidney, progressive renal 
insufficiency may result from the use of these agents. Importantly, the 
renal  insufficiency  is  generally  reversible  after  discontinuation  of  the 
offending drug.

 ■ PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM
Excess  aldosterone  production  due  to  primary  aldosteronism  is  a 
potentially  curable  form  of  hypertension.  In  patients  with  primary 
aldosteronism, increased aldosterone production is independent of the 
renin-angiotensin system, and the consequences are sodium retention, 
hypertension, hypokalemia, low PRA, cardiovascular disease, and kid-
ney damage. The reported prevalence of this disorder varies from <2 
to ~15% of hypertensive individuals. In part, this variation is related to 
the intensity of screening and the criteria for establishing the diagnosis.
History and physical examination provide little information about 
the  diagnosis.  The  age  at  the  time  of  diagnosis  is  generally  the  third 
through  fifth  decade.  Hypertension  is  usually  mild  to  moderate  but 
occasionally  may  be  severe;  primary  aldosteronism  should  be  con-
sidered in all patients with refractory hypertension. Most patients are 
asymptomatic;  however,  infrequently,  polyuria,  polydipsia,  paresthe-
sias, or muscle weakness may be present as a consequence of hypoka-
lemic alkalosis. Although serum K+ is an insensitive screening test, in 
hypertensive patients with unprovoked hypokalemia (i.e., unrelated to 
diuretics, vomiting, or diarrhea), the prevalence of primary aldostero-
nism  approaches  40–50%.  In  patients  on  diuretics,  serum  potassium 
<3.1  mmol/L  (<3.1  meq/L)  also  raises  the  possibility  of  primary 
aldosteronism.

The ratio of plasma aldosterone (PA) to PRA (PA/PRA) is a useful 
screening test. These measurements preferably are obtained in ambu-
latory patients in the morning. A ratio >30:1 in conjunction with a PA 
concentration >555 pmol/L (>20 ng/dL) reportedly has a sensitivity of 
90% and a specificity of 91% for an aldosterone-producing adenoma. 
In  a  Mayo  Clinic  series,  an  aldosterone-producing  adenoma  subse-
quently  was  confirmed  surgically  in  >90%  of  hypertensive  patients 
with  a  PA/PRA  ratio  ≥20  and  a  PA  concentration  ≥415  pmol/L  
(≥15  ng/dL).  There  are,  however,  several  caveats  to  interpreting  the 
ratio. The cutoff for a “high” ratio is laboratory- and assay-dependent. 
Some  antihypertensive  agents  may  affect  the  ratio  (e.g.,  aldosterone 
antagonists,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers  [ARBs],  and  ACEIs  may 
increase  renin;  aldosterone  antagonists  may  increase  aldosterone). 
Current  recommendations  are  to  withdraw  aldosterone  antagonists 
for at least 4–6 weeks before obtaining these measurements. Because 
aldosterone biosynthesis is potassium-dependent, hypokalemia should 
be  corrected  with  oral  potassium  supplements  prior  to  screening.  A 
high  ratio  in  the  absence  of  an  elevated  PA  level  is  considerably  less 
specific  for  primary  aldosteronism.  In  patients  with  renal  insuffi-
ciency, the ratio may also be elevated because of decreased aldosterone 
clearance. In patients with an elevated PA/PRA ratio, the diagnosis of 
primary aldosteronism can be confirmed by demonstrating failure to 
suppress PA to any one of four suppression tests: oral sodium loading, 
saline infusion, fludrocortisone, or captopril.

Several sporadic and familial adrenal abnormalities may culminate 
in  the  syndrome  of  primary  aldosteronism,  and  appropriate  therapy 
depends on the specific etiology. The two most common causes of spo-
radic  primary  aldosteronism  are  an  aldosterone-producing  adenoma 
and  bilateral  adrenal  hyperplasia.  Together,  they  account  for  >90% 
of  all  patients  with  primary  aldosteronism.  The  tumor  is  most  often 
unilateral  and  measures  <3  cm  in  diameter.  Most  of  the  remainder 
of these patients have bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia (idiopathic 
hyperaldosteronism).  An  increasing  number  of  somatic  mutations, 
including  mutations  in  aldosterone-regulating  genes,  has  been  iden-
tified  in  adenomas  and  in  idiopathic  hyperaldosteronism.  Rarely,

primary aldosteronism may be caused by an adrenal carcinoma or an 
ectopic  malignancy,  e.g.,  ovarian  arrhenoblastoma.  Functional  differ-
ences  in  hormone  secretion  may  assist  in  the  diagnosis  of  adenoma 
versus  hyperplasia.  Aldosterone  biosynthesis  is  more  responsive  to 
ACTH in patients with adenoma and more responsive to angiotensin 
in  patients  with  hyperplasia.  Consequently,  patients  with  adenoma 
tend  to  have  higher  PA  in  the  early  morning  that  decreases  during 
the day, reflecting the diurnal rhythm of ACTH, whereas PA tends to 
increase  with  upright  posture  in  patients  with  hyperplasia,  reflecting 
the  normal  postural  response  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
axis. However, there is overlap in the ability of these measurements to 
discriminate  between  adenoma  and  hyperplasia.  Rare  familial  forms 
of primary aldosteronism include glucocorticoid-remediable primary 
aldosteronism  and  familial  aldosteronism  types  II  and  III.  Familial 
primary  aldosteronism  reflects  a  variety  of  germline  mutations,  and 
genetic testing may assist in the diagnosis of these disorders.

Adrenal  computed  tomography  (CT)  should  be  carried  out  in  all 
patients diagnosed with primary aldosteronism. High-resolution CT may 
identify tumors as small as 0.3 cm and is positive for an adrenal tumor 
90% of the time. If the CT is not diagnostic, an adenoma may be detected 
by adrenal scintigraphy with 6-β-[I131] iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol after 
dexamethasone suppression (0.5 mg every 6 h for 7 days); however, this 
technique has decreased sensitivity for adenomas <1.5 cm.

When  carried  out  by  an  experienced  radiologist,  bilateral  adrenal 
venous sampling for measurement of PA is the most accurate means 
of differentiating unilateral from bilateral forms of primary aldostero-
nism. A major difference in the aldosterone/cortisol ratio is indicative 
of unilateral disease. The sensitivity and specificity of adrenal venous 
sampling (95 and 100%, respectively) for detecting unilateral aldoster-
one hypersecretion are superior to those of adrenal CT; success rates 
are  90–96%,  and  complication  rates  are  <2.5%.  One  frequently  used 
protocol  involves  sampling  for  aldosterone  and  cortisol  levels  in 
response to ACTH stimulation. An ipsilateral/contralateral aldosterone 
ratio >4, with symmetric ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels, is indicative 
of unilateral aldosterone production.

Hypertension  generally  is  responsive  to  surgery  in  patients  with 
adenoma  but  not  in  patients  with  bilateral  adrenal  hyperplasia.  For 
patients  with  a  unilateral  adenoma,  surgical  treatment  is  generally 
more  effective  than  medical  therapy.  Unilateral  adrenalectomy,  often 
done  via  a  laparoscopic  approach,  is  curative  in  40–70%  of  patients 
with  an  adenoma.  Transient  hypoaldosteronism  may  occur  up  to  
3 months postoperatively, resulting in hyperkalemia, which should be 
treated with potassium-wasting diuretics and with fludrocortisone, if 
needed. Patients with bilateral hyperplasia should be treated medically. 
The drug regimen for these patients, as well as for patients with an ade-
noma who are poor surgical candidates, should include an aldosterone 
antagonist and, if necessary, other potassium-sparing diuretics.

Glucocorticoid-remediable hyperaldosteronism is a rare, monogenic 
autosomal  dominant  disorder  characterized  by  moderate  to  severe 
hypertension, often occurring at an early age. These patients may have 
a family history of hemorrhagic stroke at a young age. Hypokalemia is 
usually mild or absent. Normally, angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone 
production  by  the  adrenal  zona  glomerulosa,  whereas  ACTH  stimu-
lates cortisol production in the zona fasciculata. Owing to a chimeric 
gene  on  chromosome  8,  ACTH  also  regulates  aldosterone  secretion 
by  the  zona  fasciculata  in  patients  with  glucocorticoid-remediable 
hyperaldosteronism.  The  consequence  is  overproduction  in  the  zona 
fasciculata of both aldosterone and hybrid steroids (18-hydroxycortisol 
and 18-oxocortisol) due to oxidation of cortisol. The diagnosis may be 
established  by  urine  excretion  rates  of  these  hybrid  steroids  that  are 
20–30 times normal or by direct genetic testing. Therapeutically, sup-
pression of ACTH with low-dose glucocorticoids corrects the hyperal-
dosteronism, hypertension, and hypokalemia. Aldosterone antagonists 
are also therapeutic options. Patients with familial aldosteronism types 
II and III are treated with aldosterone antagonists or adrenalectomy.

 ■ CUSHING’S SYNDROME
(See also Chap. 386) Cushing’s syndrome is related to excess cortisol 
production  due  either  to  excess  ACTH  secretion  (from  a  pituitary 

tumor  or  an  ectopic  tumor)  or  to  ACTH-independent  adrenal  pro-
duction  of  cortisol.  Hypertension  occurs  in  75–80%  of  patients  with 
Cushing’s syndrome. The mechanism of hypertension may be related 
to stimulation of mineralocorticoid receptors by cortisol and increased 
secretion  of  other  adrenal  steroids.  If  clinically  suspected  based  on 
phenotypic characteristics, in patients not taking exogenous glucocor-
ticoids, laboratory screening may be carried out with measurement of 
24-h excretion rates of urine-free cortisol or an overnight dexamethasone-
suppression  test.  Late  night  salivary  cortisol  is  also  a  sensitive  and 
convenient screening test. Further endocrine and radiologic evaluation 
is required to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific etiology 
of Cushing’s syndrome. Appropriate therapy depends on the etiology.

 ■ PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
(See  also  Chap.  387)  Catecholamine-secreting  tumors  are  located 
in  the  adrenal  medulla  (pheochromocytoma)  or  in  extra-adrenal 
paraganglion tissue (paraganglioma) and account for hypertension in 
~0.05% of patients. If unrecognized, pheochromocytoma may result in 
lethal cardiovascular consequences. Clinical manifestations, including 
hypertension, are primarily related to increased circulating catechola-
mines, although some of these tumors may secrete a number of other 
vasoactive substances. In a small percentage of patients, epinephrine is  
the  predominant  catecholamine  secreted  by  the  tumor,  and  these 
patients may present with hypotension rather than hypertension. The 
initial  suspicion  of  the  diagnosis  is  based  on  symptoms  and/or  the 
association  of  pheochromocytoma  with  other  disorders  (Table  277-4). 
Approximately  20%  of  pheochromocytomas  are  familial  with  auto-
somal  dominant  inheritance.  Inherited  pheochromocytomas  may  be 
associated  with  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  (MEN)  type  2A  and 
type  2B,  von  Hippel-Lindau  disease,  and  neurofibromatosis.  Each  of 
these syndromes is related to specific germline mutations. Mutations 
of  succinate  dehydrogenase  genes  are  associated  with  paraganglioma 
syndromes, generally characterized by head and neck paragangliomas. 
Laboratory  testing  consists  of  measuring  catecholamines  in  either 
urine or plasma, e.g., 24-h urine fractionated metanephrine excretion 
or  plasma-free  metanephrines  under  standardized  conditions.  The 
urine  measurement  is  less  sensitive  but  more  specific.  The  next  step 
would involve imaging of the abdomen and pelvis (CT or magnetic res-
onance imaging). Genetic screening is available for evaluating patients 
and relatives suspected of harboring a pheochromocytoma associated 
with a familial syndrome. Peripheral α-adrenergic antagonists may be 
used to control blood pressure. Surgical excision is the definitive treat-
ment of pheochromocytoma and results in cure in ~90% of patients.

 ■ MISCELLANEOUS CAUSES OF HYPERTENSION
Hypertension  occurs  in  >50%  of  individuals  with  obstructive  sleep 
apnea.  Hypertension  appears  to  be  due  to  sympathetic  activation 
caused by intermittent hypoxia and fragmented sleep. The severity of 
hypertension correlates with the severity of sleep apnea. Approximately 
70% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea are obese. Hypertension 
related to obstructive sleep apnea also should be considered in patients 
with drug-resistant hypertension and patients with a history of snor-
ing.  The  diagnosis  can  be  confirmed  by  polysomnography.  In  obese 
patients,  weight  loss  may  alleviate  or  cure  sleep  apnea  and  related 
hypertension. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel 
positive airway pressure (BiPAP) administered during sleep are effec-
tive therapies for obstructive sleep apnea. Although CPAP and BiPAP 
generally have only a modest effect on blood pressure, their use may 
improve  blood  pressure  responsiveness  to  antihypertensive  agents. 
Increasing evidence links other sleep-related disorders to hypertension, 
including restless legs syndrome and sleep-related bruxism

Coarctation  of  the  aorta  is  the  most  common  congenital  cardio-
vascular cause of hypertension (Chap. 269). The incidence is 1–8 per 
1000  live  births.  It  is  usually  sporadic  but  occurs  in  35%  of  children 
with Turner’s syndrome. Even when the anatomic lesion is surgically 
corrected in infancy, up to 30% of patients develop subsequent hyper-
tension  and  are  at  risk  of  accelerated  coronary  artery  disease  and 
cerebrovascular  events.  Patients  with  less  severe  lesions  may  not  be 
diagnosed until young adulthood. Physical findings include diminished

and delayed femoral pulses and a systolic pressure gradient between the 
right arm and the legs and, depending on the location of the coarcta-
tion, between the right and left arms. A blowing systolic murmur may 
be heard in the posterior left interscapular areas. The diagnosis may be 
confirmed by thoracic and abdominal CT, angiogram, and transesoph-
ageal  echocardiography.  Therapeutic  options  include  surgical  repair 
and balloon angioplasty, with or without placement of an intravascular 
stent.  Subsequently,  many  patients  do  not  have  a  normal  life  expec-
tancy but may have persistent hypertension, with death due to ischemic 
heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage, or aortic aneurysm.

Several  additional  endocrine  disorders,  including  thyroid  diseases 
and  acromegaly,  cause  hypertension.  Mild  diastolic  hypertension 
may  be  a  consequence  of  hypothyroidism,  whereas  hyperthyroidism 
may  result  in  systolic  hypertension.  Hypercalcemia  of  any  etiology, 
the most common being primary hyperparathyroidism, may result in 
hypertension. Preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that 
commonly presents after 20 weeks of gestation, may be a risk factor for 
subsequent cardiovascular disease and stroke. Hypertension also may 
be related to a number of prescribed or over-the-counter medications 
and other substances.

MONOGENIC HYPERTENSION
In  addition  to  glucocorticoid-remediable  primary  aldosteronism,  a 
number  of  rare  forms  of  monogenic  hypertension  have  been  iden-
tified  (Table  277–4).  These  disorders  may  be  recognized  by  their 
characteristic  phenotypes,  and  in  many  instances,  the  diagnosis  may 
be confirmed by genetic analysis. Several inherited defects in adrenal 
steroid  biosynthesis  and  metabolism  result  in  mineralocorticoid- 
induced  hypertension  and  hypokalemia.  In  patients  with  a  17α- 
hydroxylase  deficiency,  synthesis  of  sex  hormones  and  cortisol  is 
decreased (Fig. 277-3). Consequently, these individuals do not mature 

sexually; males may present with pseudohermaphroditism and females 
with  primary  amenorrhea  and  absent  secondary  sexual  characteris-
tics.  Because  cortisol-induced  negative  feedback  on  pituitary  ACTH 
production is diminished, ACTH-stimulated adrenal steroid synthesis 
proximal to the enzymatic block is increased. Hypertension and hypo-
kalemia are consequences of increased synthesis of mineralocorticoids 
proximal  to  the  enzymatic  block,  particularly  desoxycorticosterone. 
Increased steroid production and, hence, hypertension may be treated 
with low-dose glucocorticoids. An 11β-hydroxylase deficiency results 
in a salt-retaining adrenogenital syndrome that occurs in 1 in 100,000 
live births. This enzymatic defect results in decreased cortisol synthe-
sis, increased synthesis of mineralocorticoids (e.g., desoxycorticoster-
one), and shunting of steroid biosynthesis into the androgen pathway. 
In the severe form, the syndrome may present early in life, including 
the  newborn  period,  with  virilization  and  ambiguous  genitalia  in 
females and penile enlargement in males, or in older children as pre-
cocious  puberty  and  short  stature.  Acne,  hirsutism,  and  menstrual 
irregularities may be the presenting features when the disorder is first 
recognized  in  adolescence  or  early  adulthood.  Hypertension  is  less 
common in the late-onset forms. Patients with an 11β-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase deficiency have an impaired capacity to metabolize cor-
tisol to its inactive metabolite, cortisone, and hypertension is related to 
activation of mineralocorticoid receptors by cortisol. This defect may 
be inherited or acquired, due to licorice-containing glycyrrhizin acid. 
The same substance is present in the paste of several brands of chewing 
tobacco. The defect in Liddle’s syndrome (Chaps. 53 and 386) results 
from constitutive activation of amiloride-sensitive ENaC on the distal 
renal  tubule,  resulting  in  excess  sodium  reabsorption;  the  syndrome 
is  ameliorated  by  amiloride.  Hypertension  exacerbated  in  pregnancy 
(Chap. 479) may be due to activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor 
by progesterone.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Hypertension 

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL
The  initial  assessment  of  a  hypertensive  patient  should  include  a 
complete history and physical examination to confirm a diagnosis 
of hypertension, screen for other cardiovascular disease risk factors, 
screen for secondary causes of hypertension, identify cardiovascu-
lar  consequences  of  hypertension  and  other  comorbidities,  assess 
blood  pressure–related  lifestyles,  and  determine  the  potential  for 
intervention.  Most  patients  with  hypertension  have  no  specific 
symptoms referable to their blood pressure elevation. Table 277-5 
lists salient features of the history and physical examination of the 
hypertensive patient.

Reliable  measurements  of  blood  pressure  depend  on  attention 
to the details of the technique and conditions of the measurement. 
Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selec-
tion of cuff size are essential. At the first visit, blood pressure should 
be measured in both arms, and the arm with higher readings should 
be used for subsequent measurements. An average of two to three 
measurements  obtained  on  two  to  three  separate  occasions  will 
provide a more accurate estimation of blood pressure than a single 
casual measurement. Rarely, in older patients, pseudohypertension 
may be related to the inability to measure blood pressure accurately 
in severely sclerotic arteries. This condition is suggested if the radial 
pulse  remains  palpable  despite  occlusion  of  the  brachial  artery 
by  the  cuff  (Osler  maneuver).  The  actual  blood  pressure  can  be 
determined by direct intra-arterial measurement. Owing to recent 
regulations  preventing  the  use  of  mercury  because  of  concerns 
about  its  potential  toxicity,  most  office  measurements  are  made 
with  aneroid  sphygmomanometers  or  with  oscillometric  devices. 
These  instruments  should  be  calibrated  periodically,  and  their 
accuracy confirmed. 
LABORATORY TESTING
Table 277-6 lists recommended laboratory tests in the initial eval-
uation  of  hypertensive  patients.  Repeat  measurements  of  renal 

function,  serum  electrolytes,  fasting  glucose,  and  lipids  may  be 
obtained  after  the  introduction  of  a  new  antihypertensive  agent 
and then annually or more frequently if clinically indicated. More 
extensive laboratory testing is appropriate for patients with appar-
ent  drug-resistant  hypertension  or  when  the  clinical  evaluation 
suggests a secondary form of hypertension.

TREATMENT
Hypertension

Lowering  systolic  blood  pressure  by  10–12  mmHg  and  diastolic 
blood  pressure  by  5–6  mmHg  confers  relative  risk  reductions  of 
35–40% for stroke and 12–16% for CHD within 5 years of the ini-
tiation of treatment. The risk of heart failure is reduced by >50%; 
although  the  benefit  of  blood  pressure  lowering  on  progression 
of renal failure is less apparent, hypertension control is the single 
most  effective  intervention  for  slowing  the  rate  of  progression  of   
hypertension-related  kidney  disease.  There  are  more  potentially 
preventable  cardiovascular  disease  events  attributed  to  elevated 
blood pressure in individuals at higher than at lower risk of cardio-
vascular disease and in older rather than younger adults. 
LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS
Implementation of lifestyles that favorably affect blood pressure has 
implications for both the prevention and the treatment of hyperten-
sion.  Health-promoting  lifestyle  modifications  are  recommended 
for  individuals  with  “elevated”  blood  pressure  and  as  an  adjunct 
to  drug  therapy  in  hypertensive  individuals  (Table  277-7).  These 
interventions  should  address  overall  cardiovascular  disease  risk. 
Although  the  impact  of  lifestyle  interventions  on  blood  pressure 
is  more  pronounced  in  persons  with  hypertension,  in  short-term 
trials, weight loss and reduction of dietary NaCl have been shown to 
prevent the development of hypertension. In hypertensive individu-
als, even if these interventions do not produce a sufficient reduction 
in blood pressure to avoid drug therapy, the number of medications 
or doses required for blood pressure control may be reduced.

Prevention and treatment of obesity are important for reducing 
blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk. In short-term trials, 
even modest weight loss can lead to a reduction of blood pressure 
and  an  increase  in  insulin  sensitivity.  In  longitudinal  studies,  a 
direct  correlation  exists  between  change  in  weight  and  change 
in  blood  pressure  over  time.  Average  blood  pressure  reductions 
of  6.3/3.1  mmHg  have  been  observed  with  a  reduction  in  mean 
body  weight  of  9.2  kg.  Regular  physical  activity  facilitates  weight 
loss,  decreases  blood  pressure,  and  reduces  the  overall  risk  of

cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure may be lowered by 30 min of 
moderately intense physical activity, such as brisk walking, 6–7 days 
a week, or by more intense, less frequent workouts.

There  is  individual  variability  in  the  sensitivity  of  blood  pres-
sure to NaCl, and this variability may have a genetic basis. Several 
genetic  loci  have  been  associated  with  NaCl  sensitivity.  Based  on 
results  of  meta-analyses,  lowering  of  blood  pressure  by  limiting 
daily  NaCl  intake  to  4.4–7.4  g  (75–125  meq)  results  in  blood 
pressure reductions of 3.7–4.9/0.9–2.9 mmHg in hypertensive indi-
viduals  and  lesser  reductions  in  normotensive  individuals.  Salt 
sensitivity is especially common in blacks, older adults, and those 
with  higher  levels  of  blood  pressure.  Independent  of  its  effect  on 
blood pressure, excessive consumption of NaCl is associated with 
an  increased  risk  of  stroke  and  cardiovascular  disease.  Potassium 
and  calcium  supplementation  have  inconsistent,  modest  antihy-
pertensive  effects,  and,  independent  of  blood  pressure,  potassium 
supplementation may be associated with reduced stroke mortality. 
Additionally, consuming three or more alcoholic drinks per day (a 
standard  drink  contains  ~14  g  ethanol)  is  associated  with  higher 
blood  pressures,  and  a  reduction  of  alcohol  consumption  is  asso-
ciated with a reduction of blood pressure. The Dietary Approaches 
to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial convincingly demonstrated that 
over an 8-week period a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat 
dairy  products  lowers  blood  pressure  in  individuals  with  high- 
normal  blood  pressures  or  mild  hypertension.  Reduction  of  daily 
NaCl intake to <6 g (100 meq) augmented the effect of this diet on 
blood pressure. Fruits and vegetables are enriched sources of potas-
sium, magnesium, and fiber, and dairy products are an important 
source of calcium. 
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY
According to 2017 guidelines developed by the American College 
of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA), athero-
sclerotic  cardiovascular  disease  (ASCVD)  risk  estimation  guides 
the threshold for initiation of blood pressure–lowering medications 
(Table  277-8).  A  risk  calculator  may  be  used  to  estimate  risk  of 
ASCVD, e.g., ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (http://tools.acc.
org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator).

There  is  considerable  variation  in  individual  responses  to  dif-
ferent  classes  of  antihypertensive  agents,  and  the  magnitude  of 
response  to  any  single  agent  may  be  limited  by  activation  of 
counter-regulatory  mechanisms.  To  achieve  goal  blood  pressure, 
most  patients  will  require  at  least  two  antihypertensive  agents. 
More often than not, combinations of agents, with complementary 
antihypertensive  mechanisms,  are  required  to  achieve  goal  blood 
pressure reductions. Selection of antihypertensive agents and com-
binations  of  agents  should  be  individualized,  taking  into  account

vasodilators. Thiazides are safe, efficacious, inexpensive, and reduce 
clinical  events.  They  provide  additive  blood  pressure–lowering 
effects  when  combined  with  beta  blockers,  ACEIs,  or  ARBs.  In 
contrast, addition of a diuretic to a calcium channel blocker is less 
effective.  Usual  doses  of  hydrochlorothiazide  range  from  6.25  to   
50 mg/d. Owing to an increased incidence of metabolic side effects 
(hypokalemia,  insulin  resistance,  increased  cholesterol),  higher 
doses generally are not recommended. Chlorthalidone is a diuretic 
structurally  similar  to  hydrochlorothiazide,  and  like  hydrochloro-
thiazide,  it  blocks  sodium-chloride  cotransport  in  the  early  distal 
tubule. However, chlorthalidone has a longer half-life (40–60 h vs 
9–15  h)  and  an  antihypertensive  potency  ~1.5–2.0  times  that  of 
hydrochlorothiazide. Potassium loss is also greater with chlorthali-
done. Two potassium-sparing diuretics, amiloride and triamterene, 
act by inhibiting ENaC in the distal nephron. These agents are weak 
antihypertensive  agents  but  may  be  used  in  combination  with  a 
thiazide to protect against hypokalemia. The main pharmacologic 
target  for  loop  diuretics  is  the  Na+-K+-2Cl–  cotransporter  in  the 
thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Loop diuretics generally 
are reserved for hypertensive patients with reduced glomerular fil-
tration rates (reflected in serum creatinine >220 μmol/L [>2.5 mg/
dL]), CHF, or sodium retention and edema for some other reason, 
such as treatment with a potent vasodilator, e.g., minoxidil. 
Blockers  of  the  Renin-Angiotensin  System  ACEIs  decrease  the 
production of angiotensin II, increase bradykinin levels, and reduce 
sympathetic nervous system activity. ARBs provide selective block-
ade of AT1Rs, and the effect of angiotensin II on unblocked AT2Rs 
may  augment  their  hypotensive  effect.  Both  classes  of  agents  are 
effective  antihypertensive  agents  that  may  be  used  as  monother-
apy  or  in  combination  with  diuretics,  calcium  antagonists,  and 
alpha-blocking agents. ACEIs and ARBs improve insulin action and 
ameliorate the adverse effects of diuretics on glucose metabolism. 
Although the overall impact on the incidence of diabetes is modest, 
compared  with  amlodipine  (a  calcium  antagonist),  valsartan  (an 
ARB) has been shown to reduce the risk of developing diabetes in 
high-risk  hypertensive  patients.  ACEI/ARB  combinations  are  less 
effective  in  lowering  blood  pressure  than  is  the  case  when  either 
class  of  these  agents  is  used  in  combination  with  other  classes  of 
agents. In patients with vascular disease or a high risk of diabetes, 
combination  ACEI/ARB  therapy  has  been  associated  with  more 
adverse  events  (e.g.,  cardiovascular  death,  myocardial  infarction, 
stroke,  and  hospitalization  for  heart  failure)  without  increases  in 
benefit.

Side effects of ACEIs and ARBs include functional renal insuf-
ficiency due to efferent renal arteriolar dilation in a kidney with a 
stenotic lesion of the renal artery. Additional predisposing condi-
tions to renal insufficiency induced by these agents include dehy-
dration,  CHF,  and  use  of  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs. 
Dry cough occurs in ~15% of patients, and angioedema occurs in 
<1% of patients taking ACEIs. Angioedema occurs most commonly 
in  individuals  of  Asian  origin  and  more  commonly  in  African 
Americans than in whites. Hyperkalemia due to hypoaldosteronism 
is an occasional side effect of both ACEIs and ARBs.

An alternative approach to blocking the renin-angiotensin sys-
tem  has  recently  been  introduced  into  clinical  practice  for  the 
treatment of hypertension: direct renin inhibitors. Blockade of the 
renin-angiotensin  system  is  more  complete  with  renin  inhibitors 
than  with  ACEIs  or  ARBs.  Aliskiren  is  the  first  of  a  class  of  oral, 
nonpeptide  competitive  inhibitors  of  the  enzymatic  activity  of 
renin.  Monotherapy  with  aliskiren  seems  to  be  as  effective  as  an 
ACEI or ARB for lowering blood pressure, but not more effective. 
Further blood reductions may be achieved when aliskiren is used in 
combination with a thiazide diuretic or a calcium antagonist. Cur-
rently, aliskiren is not considered a first-line antihypertensive agent. 
Aldosterone  Antagonists  Spironolactone 
is  a  nonselective 
aldosterone  antagonist  that  may  be  used  alone  or  in  combination 
with a thiazide diuretic. It may be a particularly effective agent in 

patients with low-renin primary hypertension, resistant hyperten-
sion,  and  primary  aldosteronism.  In  patients  with  CHF,  low-dose 
spironolactone  reduces  mortality  and  hospitalizations  for  heart 
failure when given in addition to conventional therapy with ACEIs, 
digoxin, and loop diuretics. Because spironolactone binds to pro-
gesterone and androgen receptors, side effects may include gyneco-
mastia, impotence, and menstrual abnormalities. These side effects 
are circumvented by a newer agent, eplerenone, which is a selective 
aldosterone antagonist. 
Calcium Channel Blockers  Calcium antagonists reduce vascular 
resistance  through  L-channel  blockade,  which  reduces  intracellu-
lar  calcium  and  blunts  vasoconstriction.  This  is  a  heterogeneous 
group of agents that includes drugs in the following three classes: 
phenylalkylamines  (verapamil),  benzothiazepines  (diltiazem),  and 
1,4-dihydropyridines (nifedipine-like). Used alone and in combina-
tion with other agents (ACEIs, beta blockers, α1-adrenergic block-
ers), calcium antagonists effectively lower blood pressure; however, 
it is unclear if adding a diuretic to a calcium blocker results in a fur-
ther lowering of blood pressure. Side effects of flushing, headache, 
and edema with dihydropyridine use are related to their potencies 
as arteriolar dilators; edema is due to an increase in transcapillary 
pressure gradients, not to net salt and water retention. 
Beta Blockers  β-Adrenergic receptor blockers lower blood pres-
sure by decreasing cardiac output owing to a reduction of heart rate 
and contractility. Other proposed mechanisms by which beta block-
ers lower blood pressure include a central nervous system effect and 
inhibition of renin release. Beta blockers are particularly effective 
in  hypertensive  patients  with  tachycardia,  and  their  hypotensive 
potency is enhanced by co-administration with a diuretic. In lower 
doses,  some  beta  blockers  selectively  inhibit  cardiac  β1  receptors 
and have less influence on β2 receptors on bronchial and vascular 
smooth  muscle  cells;  however,  there  seems  to  be  no  difference  in 
the  antihypertensive  potencies  of  cardioselective  and  nonselective 
beta blockers. Some beta blockers have intrinsic sympathomimetic 
activity, although it is uncertain whether this constitutes an overall 
advantage or disadvantage in cardiac therapy. Beta blockers without 
intrinsic  sympathomimetic  activity  decrease  the  rate  of  sudden 
death,  overall  mortality,  and  recurrent  myocardial  infarction.  In 
patients with CHF, beta blockers reduce the risks of hospitalization 
and mortality. Carvedilol and labetalol block both β receptors and 
peripheral  α-adrenergic  receptors.  The  potential  advantages  of 
combined  β-  and  α-adrenergic  blockade  in  treating  hypertension 
remain  to  be  determined.  Nebivolol  represents  another  class  of 
cardioselective beta blockers that has additional vasodilator actions 
related to enhancement of nitric oxide activity. Whether this con-
fers greater clinical effectiveness remains to be determined. 
α-Adrenergic Blockers  Postsynaptic, selective α-adrenoreceptor 
antagonists lower blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular 
resistance.  They  are  effective  antihypertensive  agents  used  either 
as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with  other  agents.  However, 
in  clinical  trials  of  hypertensive  patients,  alpha  blockade  has  not 
been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality or to 
provide as much protection against CHF as other classes of antihy-
pertensive agents. These agents are also effective in treating lower 
urinary  tract  symptoms  in  men  with  prostatic  hypertrophy.  Non-
selective  α-adrenoreceptor  antagonists  bind  to  postsynaptic  and 
presynaptic receptors and are used primarily for the management 
of patients with pheochromocytoma. 
Sympatholytic  Agents  Centrally  acting  α2  sympathetic  agonists 
decrease  peripheral  resistance  by  inhibiting  sympathetic  outflow. 
They may be particularly useful in patients with autonomic neurop-
athy who have wide variations in blood pressure due to barorecep-
tor  denervation.  Drawbacks  include  somnolence,  dry  mouth,  and 
rebound  hypertension  on  withdrawal.  Peripheral  sympatholytics 
decrease  peripheral  resistance  and  venous  constriction  by  deplet-
ing  nerve  terminal  norepinephrine.  Although  they  are  potentially

orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction, and numerous drug-
drug interactions. Rebound hypertension is another concern with 
abrupt cessation of drugs with a short half-life. 
Direct  Vasodilators  Direct  vasodilators  decrease  peripheral 
resistance  and  concomitantly  activate  mechanisms  that  defend 
arterial pressure, notably the sympathetic nervous system, the renin- 
angiotensin-aldosterone  system,  and  sodium  retention.  Usually, 
they are not considered first-line agents but are most effective when 
added to a combination that includes a diuretic and a beta blocker. 
Hydralazine is a direct vasodilator that has antioxidant and nitric 
oxide–enhancing actions. Minoxidil is a particularly potent vasodi-
lator and is used most frequently in patients with renal insufficiency 
who  are  refractory  to  all  other  drugs.  Hydralazine  may  induce  a 
lupus-like  syndrome,  and  side  effects  of  minoxidil  include  hyper-
trichosis  and  pericardial  effusion.  Intravenous  nitroprusside  can 
be  used  to  treat  malignant  hypertension  and  life-threatening  left 
ventricular heart failure associated with elevated arterial pressure. 
COMPARISONS OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVES
Meta-analyses of pooled clinical trials suggest essentially equivalent 
blood pressure–lowering effects of the following six major classes 
of  antihypertensive  agents  when  used  as  monotherapy:  thiazide 
diuretics,  beta  blockers,  ACEIs,  ARBs,  calcium  antagonists,  and 
α1  blockers.  On  average,  standard  doses  of  most  antihypertensive 
agents reduce blood pressure by 8–10/4–7 mmHg; however, there 
may  be  subgroup  differences  in  responsiveness.  Younger  patients 
may  be  more  responsive  to  beta  blockers  and  ACEIs,  whereas 
patients  aged  >50  years  may  be  more  responsive  to  diuretics  and 
calcium antagonists. There is a limited relationship between plasma 
renin and blood pressure response. Patients with high-renin hyper-
tension may be more responsive to ACEIs and ARBs than to other 
classes of agents, whereas patients with low-renin hypertension are 
more  responsive  to  diuretics  and  calcium  antagonists.  Hyperten-
sive  African  Americans  tend  to  have  low  renin  and  may  require 
higher  doses  of  ACEIs  and  ARBs  than  whites  for  optimal  blood 
pressure control, although this difference is abolished when these 
agents are combined with a diuretic. Beta blockers also appear to 
be less effective than thiazide diuretics in African Americans than 
in non–African Americans. Early pharmacogenetic studies, utiliz-
ing  a  candidate  gene  approach,  genome-wide  scans,  or  integrated 
metabolomic and genetic profiles, have shown associations of gene 
polymorphisms with blood pressure responsiveness to specific anti-
hypertensive  drugs.  However,  the  reported  effects  have  generally 
been too small to affect clinical decisions, and associated polymor-
phisms remain to be confirmed.

A  meta-analysis  of  >30  randomized  trials  of  blood  pressure– 
lowering therapy indicates that for a given reduction in blood pressure, 
with  several  notable  exceptions,  the  major  drug  classes  produce 
similar overall net effects on total cardiovascular events. For exam-
ple, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent 
Heart  Attack  Trial  (ALLHAT)  demonstrated  that  the  occurrence 
of  fatal  CHD  and  nonfatal  myocardial  infarction  was  virtually 
identical in hypertensive patients treated with an ACEI (lisinopril), 
a  diuretic  (chlorthalidone),  or  a  calcium  antagonist  (amlodipine). 
However, one arm of ALLHAT involving therapy with a peripher-
ally  acting  α  antagonist  (doxazosin)  was  terminated  prematurely 
because  the  incidence  of  heart  failure,  stroke,  and  combined  car-
diovascular disease events was higher in doxazosin-treated than in 
chlorthalidone-treated  patients.  Increasing  evidence  suggests  that 
beta blockers are inferior to other classes of agents for prevention of 
cardiovascular events, stroke, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. 
Some beta blockers have less effect on central aortic pressure than 
other  classes  of  antihypertensive  agents.  However,  beta  blockers 
remain  appropriate  therapy  for  hypertensive  patients  with  con-
comitant heart disease and related comorbidities. Calcium channel 
blockers may be inferior and diuretics superior to other classes of 
agents for the prevention of heart failure.

In specific patient groups, ACEIs may have particular advantages, 
beyond that of blood pressure control, in reducing cardiovascular 
and  renal  outcomes.  ACEIs  and  ARBs  decrease  intraglomerular 
pressure and proteinuria and may retard the rate of progression of 
renal  insufficiency,  not  totally  accounted  for  by  their  hypotensive 
effects, in both diabetic and nondiabetic renal diseases. In patients 
with type 2 diabetes, treatment with an ACEI, an ARB, or aliskiren 
decreases  proteinuria  and  delays  the  progression  of  renal  disease. 
In  experimental  models  of  hypertension  and  diabetes,  renal  pro-
tection with aliskiren is comparable to that with ACEIs and ARBs. 
However, in patients with type 2 diabetes, addition of aliskiren to 
an ACEI provides no additional protection against cardiovascular 
or renal disease and may be associated with more adverse outcomes. 
Among African Americans with hypertension-related renal disease, 
ACEIs appear to be more effective than beta blockers or dihydro-
pyridine  calcium  channel  blockers  in  slowing,  although  not  pre-
venting, the decline of glomerular filtration rate. The renoprotective 
effect  of  these  renin-angiotensin  blockers,  compared  with  other 
antihypertensive drugs, is less obvious at lower blood pressures.

In  most  patients  with  hypertension  and  heart  failure  due  to 
systolic  and/or  diastolic  dysfunction,  diuretics,  ACEIs  or  ARBs, 
and  beta  blockers  improve  survival.  Independent  of  blood  pres-
sure,  in  both  hypertensive  and  normotensive  individuals,  ACEIs 
attenuate the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, improve 
symptomatology  and  risk  of  death  from  CHF,  and  reduce  mor-
bidity  and  mortality  rates  in  post–myocardial  infarction  patients. 
Similar  benefits  in  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality  rates 
in  patients  with  CHF  have  been  observed  with  the  use  of  ARBs. 
ACEIs provide better coronary protection than do calcium channel 
blockers,  whereas  calcium  channel  blockers  provide  more  stroke 
protection than do either ACEIs or beta blockers. Results of a large,  
double-blind,  prospective  clinical  trial  (Avoiding  Cardiovascular 
Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Sys-
tolic Hypertension [ACCOMPLISH] Trial) indicated that combina-
tion treatment with an ACEI (benazepril) plus a calcium antagonist 
(amlodipine)  was  superior  to  treatment  with  the  ACEI  plus  a 
diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) in reducing the risk of cardiovascu-
lar events and death among high-risk patients with hypertension. 
However, the combination of an ACEI and a diuretic has recently 
been  shown  to  produce  major  reductions  in  morbidity  and  mor-
tality in the very elderly. After a stroke, combination therapy with 
an ACEI and a diuretic, but not with an ARB, has been reported to 
reduce the rate of recurrent stroke.

There  has  been  a  recent  resurgence  of  interest  in  two  non-
pharmacologic  antihypertensive  therapies  that  interrupt  sympa-
thetic  outflow:  (1)  device-based  carotid  baroreflex  activation  by 
electrical  stimulation  of  the  carotid  sinus;  and  (2)  endovascular 
radiofrequency  ablation  of  the  renal  sympathetic  nerves.  Both 
have been suggested as potential options for treatment of resistant 
hypertension.  Whereas  renal  denervation  is  a  minimally  invasive 
procedure, carotid baroreceptor stimulation is a surgical procedure, 
usually performed under general anesthesia, that involves implant-
ing  electrodes  on  both  the  right  and  left  carotid  arteries.  Clinical 
experience  with  baroreflex  activation  is  limited.  Enthusiasm  for 
renal denervation has been questioned by the results of Simplicity 
HTN-3,  a  randomized,  prospective  clinical  trial  comparing  bilat-
eral renal denervation with a sham procedure in 535 patients with 
resistant hypertension. At the end of 6 months, there was no benefit 
of renal artery denervation on both office and ambulatory systolic 
blood pressures, the trial’s primary endpoints. Subsequent clinical 
trials  have  demonstrated  substantial  blood  pressure  variability  in 
responses  to  both  of  these  interventions.  It  remains  to  be  seen 
whether these interventions will be adopted into clinical practice. 

BLOOD PRESSURE GOALS OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE 
THERAPY
Based  on  clinical  trial  data,  the  maximum  protection  against 
combined  cardiovascular  endpoints  is  achieved  with  pressures

<135–140  mmHg  for  systolic  blood  pressure  and  <80–85  mmHg 
for  diastolic  blood  pressure;  however,  treatment  has  not  reduced 
cardiovascular disease risk to the level in nonhypertensive individ-
uals. According to a recent meta-analysis, the magnitude of the pro-
portional  reduction  of  cardiovascular  events  is  broadly  consistent 
regardless  of  baseline  comorbidity,  although  the  absolute  benefit 
of blood pressure reduction is greater among individuals with the 
highest risk for cardiovascular events.

The  degree  of  benefit  derived  from  antihypertensive  agents 
is  related  to  the  magnitude  of  the  blood  pressure  reduction.  An 
intensive  blood  pressure–lowering  strategy  is  superior  to  a  less 
intensive  strategy  for  prevention  of  stroke  and  myocardial  infarc-
tion.  For  example,  the  SPRINT  trial  studied  9361  subjects  aged   
>50 years at increased risk for cardiovascular events. Intensive blood 
pressure control (systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg) reduced the 
risk of cardiovascular events and mortality by 25% compared with 
less  intensive  control  (systolic  blood  pressure  135–139  mmHg). 
In  patients  with  chronic  renal  insufficiency,  a  small,  nonprogres-
sive  increase  in  the  serum  creatinine  concentration  may  occur 
with  intensive  blood  pressure  lowering.  This  generally  reflects  a 
hemodynamic response, not structural renal injury, indicating that 
intraglomerular pressure has been reduced. Blood pressure control 
should not be allowed to deteriorate in order to prevent the modest 
creatinine rise.

In  diabetic  patients,  effective  blood  pressure  control  reduces 
the  risk  of  cardiovascular  events  and  death  as  well  as  the  risk  for 
microvascular  disease  (nephropathy,  retinopathy).  Various  guide-
lines have been recommended for hypertension control in patients 
with  type  2  diabetes  (e.g.,  <140/90,  <140/85,  or  <130/80  mmHg). 
One widely cited study, the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk 
in  Diabetes  (ACCORD)  clinical  trial,  failed  to  find  superiority  of 
intensive  blood  pressure  lowering  (<120  mmHg)  over  standard 
blood  pressure  control  (<140  mmHg)  in  reducing  the  risk  of  the 
study’s  primary  outcome  (a  composite  endpoint  of  myocardial 
infarction,  stroke,  and  cardiovascular  death)  in  diabetic  patients. 
However, that trial did demonstrate a significant reduction of stroke 
and left ventricular hypertrophy with more intensive therapy.

Guidelines establishing blood pressure targets for hypertension 
control continue to evolve. According to 2017 guidelines developed 
by the ACC/AHA, the recommended goal of blood pressure control 
for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease 
is a blood pressure <130/80 mmHg, including patients with diabe-
tes  mellitus  and  chronic  kidney  diseases  (Table  277-8).  However, 
in hypertensive patients without elevated ASCVD risk, the clinical 
trial  evidence  is  strongest  for  a  target  blood  pressure  of  140/90 
mmHg.  In  contrast  to  other  ACC/AHA  recommendations  that 
are based on randomized clinical trials, this guideline is primarily 
based on observational studies. Among older patients with isolated 
systolic hypertension, further lowering of diastolic blood pressure 
does  not  result  in  harm.  Relatively  little  information  is  available 
concerning the risk-versus-benefit ratio of intensive antihyperten-
sive therapy in individuals >80 years of age, and in this population, 
gradual blood pressure reduction to a less aggressive target level of 
control may be appropriate (e.g., 130–150 mmHg). More intensive 
control may be associated with a higher incidence of adverse events 
(e.g., syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, deterioration of renal func-
tion). Additionally, the <130/80 mmHg target blood pressure may 
not  be  acceptable  or  implementable  in  low-  and  middle-income 
countries because of the lack of supporting resources. In the final 
analysis,  all  patients  need  to  be  carefully  monitored,  and  clinical 
decision-making should be individualized.

To achieve recommended blood pressure goals, the majority of 
individuals  with  hypertension  will  require  treatment  with  more 
than  one  drug.  Three  or  more  drugs  frequently  are  needed  in 
patients  with  diabetes  and  renal  insufficiency.  For  most  agents, 
reduction  of  blood  pressure  at  half-standard  doses  is  only  ~20% 
less than at standard doses. Appropriate combinations of agents at 
these lower doses may have additive or almost additive effects on 

blood pressure with a lower incidence of side effects. Hypertension 
control rates are <20% worldwide and <50% in the United States. 
These  low  control  rates  reflect  patient  nonadherence  and  lack  of 
implementation of recommended guidelines.

The  term  resistant  hypertension  refers  to  patients  with  blood 
pressures persistently >140/90 mmHg despite taking three or more 
antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic. Resistant or difficult- 
to-control hypertension is more common in patients aged >60 years 
than  in  younger  patients.  Resistant  hypertension  may  be  related 
to  nonadherence  to  therapy,  identifiable  causes  of  hypertension 
(including  obesity,  primary  aldosteronism,  and  excessive  alcohol 
intake), and the use of any of a number of nonprescription and pre-
scription drugs (Table 277-3). Evaluation of patients with resistant 
hypertension  might  include  home  blood  pressure  monitoring  to 
determine if office blood pressures are representative of the usual 
blood pressure. A more extensive evaluation for a secondary form 
of hypertension should be undertaken if no other explanation for 
hypertension  resistance  becomes  apparent.  In  the  absence  of  a 
specific identifiable cause, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, 
especially spironolactone, have been demonstrated to be the most 
effective  add-on  drugs  for  the  treatment  of  resistant  hyperten-
sion.  Additionally,  resistant  hypertension  is  often  associated  with 
increased sympathetic nervous activity, raising the possibility that 
electrical stimulation of the carotid baroreceptor or renal denerva-
tion may have a role in the treatment of these patients. However, 
that remains to be determined. 

HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES
Probably  due  to  the  widespread  availability  of  antihypertensive 
therapy, in the United States, there has been a decline in the num-
bers of patients presenting with hypertensive urgencies and emer-
gencies. Severe asymptomatic hypertension (systolic blood pressure 
≥180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥120 mmHg) is considered 
a  hypertensive  “urgency,”  but  when  accompanied  by  acute  target 
damage, it is considered a hypertensive “emergency.” Most patients 
who present with severe hypertension are chronically hypertensive, 
and there are inherent risks to overly aggressive initial antihyper-
tensive  therapy.  In  hypertensive  individuals,  the  upper  and  lower 
limits of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow are shifted to higher 
levels of arterial pressure, and rapid lowering of blood pressure to 
below  the  lower  limit  of  autoregulation  may  precipitate  cerebral 
ischemia or infarction as a consequence of decreased cerebral blood 
flow. Renal and coronary blood flows also may decrease with overly 
aggressive  acute  therapy.  Consequently,  the  rapidity  with  which 
blood pressure should be lowered is dependent on the presence of 
new or worsening target organ damage and the presence or absence 
of cardiovascular disease complications. In patients with a hyper-
tensive  urgency,  except  for  those  with  acute  aortic  dissections  or 
hemorrhagic strokes, blood pressure is generally gradually lowered 
over 24 h to ~25% of the initial value. Tables 277-10 and 277-11 list 
a number of hypertension-related emergencies and recommended 
therapies.

The  syndrome  of  malignant  hypertension  is  an  example  of  a 
hypertensive emergency that is associated with an abrupt increase 
of  blood  pressure  in  a  patient  with  underlying  hypertension  or 
related  to  the  sudden  onset  of  hypertension  in  a  previously  nor-
motensive individual. The absolute level of blood pressure is not as 
important as its rate of rise. Pathologically, the syndrome is asso-
ciated  with  diffuse  necrotizing  vasculitis,  arteriolar  thrombi,  and 
fibrin  deposition  in  arteriolar  walls.  Fibrinoid  necrosis  has  been 
observed  in  arterioles  of  kidney,  brain,  retina,  and  other  organs. 
Clinically,  the  syndrome  is  recognized  by  progressive  retinopa-
thy  (arteriolar  spasm,  hemorrhages,  exudates,  and  papilledema), 
deteriorating  renal  function  with  proteinuria,  microangiopathic 
hemolytic  anemia,  and  encephalopathy.  Historic  inquiry  should 
include questions about the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
and  recreational  drugs  (e.g.,  cocaine,  amphetamines).  In  patients 
with encephalopathy, the initial goal of therapy is to reduce mean

arterial  blood  pressure  by  no  more  than  25%  within  minutes  to   
2 h or to a blood pressure in the range of 160/100–110 mmHg. This 
may be accomplished with IV nitroprusside, a short-acting vasodi-
lator with a rapid onset of action that allows for minute-to-minute 
control of blood pressure. Parenteral labetalol and nicardipine are 
also  effective  agents  for  the  treatment  of  hypertensive  encephal-
opathy.  In  the  absence  of  encephalopathy  or  another  catastrophic 
event, it is preferable to reduce blood pressure over hours or longer 
rather than minutes. This goal may effectively be achieved initially 
with frequent dosing of short-acting oral agents such as captopril, 
clonidine, and labetalol.

Acute,  transient  blood  pressure  elevations  that  last  days  to 
weeks frequently occur after thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes. 
Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired in ischemic cere-
bral tissue, and higher arterial pressures may be required to main-
tain  cerebral  blood  flow.  Aggressive  reductions  of  blood  pressure 
should be avoided. With the increasing availability of improved CT 
technology for the noninvasive measurement of cerebral blood flow, 
studies are in progress to evaluate the effects of different classes of 
antihypertensive agents on both blood pressure and cerebral blood 
flow after an acute stroke. To prevent recurrence of cerebrovascular 
events, reduction of blood pressure appears to be more important

than the choice of specific agents. In the absence of comorbid con-
ditions  requiring  acute  therapy,  for  patients  with  a  systolic  blood 
pressure  ≥220  mmHg  or  a  diastolic  blood  pressure  ≥120  mmHg, 
who  are  not  candidates  for  thrombolytic  therapy  or  endovascular 
treatment, the benefit of instituting antihypertensive therapy within 
the first 48–72 h is uncertain. One suggestion for these patients is 
to  lower  blood  pressure  by  15%  during  the  first  24  h  after  onset 
of  the  stroke.  For  patients  with  less  severe  hypertension,  acute 
reduction of blood pressure is not effective in preventing death or 
dependency. If thrombolytic therapy or endovascular treatment is 
to be used, the recommended goal is to reduce blood pressure to   
<185  mmHg  systolic  pressure  and  <110  mmHg  diastolic  pressure 
before  thrombolytic  therapy  is  initiated.  For  neurologically  stable 
patients with blood pressure >140/90 mmHg, starting or restarting 
antihypertensive therapy after the first 24 h to improve long-term 
blood pressure control is reasonable. In patients with hemorrhagic 
stroke, who have systolic blood pressure >220 mmHg, it is reason-
able  to  use  continuous  intravenous  drug  infusion  to  lower  blood 
pressure. However, there is no consistent evidence that acute reduc-
tions  of  systolic  blood  pressure  to  a  more  aggressive  target  than 
140–179  mmHg  improve  functional  outcome.  The  management 
of  hypertension  after  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  is  controversial. 
Cautious reduction of blood pressure is indicated if mean arterial 
pressure is >130 mmHg.

In  addition  to  pheochromocytoma,  an  adrenergic  crisis  due  to 
catecholamine  excess  may  be  related  to  cocaine  or  amphetamine 
overdose, clonidine withdrawal, acute spinal cord injuries, and an 
interaction  of  tyramine-containing  compounds  with  monoamine 
oxidase  inhibitors.  These  patients  may  be  treated  with  phentola-
mine or nitroprusside.

Treatment  of  hypertension  in  patients  with  acute  aortic  dis-
section is discussed in Chap. 280, and treatment of hypertension 
in pregnancy is discussed in Chap. 479.

278 Renovascular Disease

Stephen C. Textor

The  renal  vasculature  is  unusually  complex  with  rich  arteriolar  flow 
to the cortex in excess of metabolic requirements, consistent with its 
primary function as a filtering organ. After delivering blood to cortical 
glomeruli,  the  postglomerular  circulation  supplies  deeper  medullary 
segments that support energy-dependent solute transport at multiple 
levels  of  the  renal  tubule.  These  postglomerular  vessels  deliver  less 
blood and, with high oxygen consumption, leave the deeper medullary 
regions at the margin of hypoxemia. Vascular disorders that commonly 
threaten the blood supply of the kidney include large-vessel atheroscle-
rosis,  fibromuscular  diseases,  and  embolic  disorders.  Microvascular 
injury, including inflammatory and primary hematologic disorders, 
is described in Chap. 317.

MECHANISMS OF VASCULAR INJURY AND 
HYPERTENSION
The glomerular capillary endothelium shares susceptibility to oxidative 
stress,  pressure  injury,  and  inflammation  with  other  vascular  territo-
ries. Endothelial injury can be manifest by urinary albumin excretion 
(UAE), which is predictive of systemic atherosclerotic disease events. 
Increased UAE may develop years before cardiovascular events. UAE 
and the risk of cardiovascular events are both reduced with pharmaco-
logic therapy such as antihypertensive drugs and statins. Experimen-
tal  studies  demonstrate  functional  changes  and  rarefaction  of  renal 
microvessels  under  conditions  of  accelerated  atherosclerosis  and/or 
compromise of proximal perfusion pressures with large-vessel disease 
(Fig. 278-1).

Large-vessel renal artery occlusive disease can result from extrinsic 
compression of the vessel, intimal dissection, aortic stent graft place-
ment,  fibromuscular  dysplasia  (FMD),  or,  most  commonly,  athero-
sclerotic disease. Any disorder that reduces perfusion pressure to the 
kidney can activate mechanisms that tend to restore renal pressures at 
the expense of developing systemic hypertension. Because restoration 
of perfusion pressures can reverse these pathways, renal artery stenosis 
is considered a specifically treatable “secondary” cause of hypertension.

Renal artery stenosis is common and often has only minor hemody-
namic effects. FMD is reported in 3–5% of normal subjects presenting 
as potential kidney donors without hypertension. It may present clin-
ically with hypertension in younger individuals (between age 15 and 
50), most often women. FMD does not often threaten kidney function, 
but  sometimes  produces  total  occlusion  and  can  be  associated  with 
renal artery aneurysms. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) 
is  common  in  the  general  population  (6.8%  of  a  community-based 
sample  above  age  65).  The  prevalence  increases  with  age  and  for 
patients with other vascular conditions such as coronary artery disease 
(18–23%) and/or peripheral aortic or lower extremity disease (>30%). 
If  untreated,  ARAS  progresses  in  nearly  50%  of  cases  over  a  5-year 
period,  sometimes  to  total  occlusion.  Intensive  treatment  of  arterial 
blood  pressure  and  statin  therapy  can  slow  these  rates  and  improve 
clinical outcomes.

Critical levels of stenosis lead to a reduction in perfusion pressure 
that activates the renin-angiotensin system, reduces sodium excretion, 
and  activates  sympathetic  adrenergic  pathways.  These  events  lead  to 
systemic  hypertension  characterized  by  angiotensin  dependence  in 
the early stages, widely varying pressures, loss of circadian blood pres-
sure (BP) rhythms, and accelerated target organ injury, including left 
ventricular hypertrophy and renal fibrosis. Renovascular hypertension 
can be treated with agents that block the renin-angiotensin system and 
other drugs that modify these pressor pathways. It can also be treated 
with restoration of renal blood flow by either endovascular or surgical 
revascularization.  Most  patients  require  continued  antihypertensive 
drug therapy due to preexisting hypertension and because revasculari-
zation alone rarely lowers BP to normal.

ARAS and systemic hypertension tend to affect both the poststenotic 
and  contralateral  kidneys,  reducing  overall  glomerular  filtration  rate 
(GFR) in ARAS. When kidney function is threatened by large-vessel 
disease  primarily,  it  has  been  labeled  ischemic  nephropathy.  Moder-
ately  reduced  blood  flow  that  develops  gradually  is  associated  with 
reduced GFR and limited oxygen consumption with preserved tissue 
oxygenation. Hence, kidney function often remains stable during med-
ical therapy, sometimes for years. With more advanced disease, reduc-
tions  in  cortical  perfusion  and  overt  tissue  hypoxia  develop.  Unlike 
FMD, ARAS develops in patients with other risk factors for atheroscle-
rosis  and  is  commonly  superimposed  upon  preexisting  small-vessel 
disease in the kidney resulting from hypertension, aging, and diabetes. 
Nearly  85%  of  patients  considered  for  renal  revascularization  have

stage  3–5  chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD)  with  GFR  <60  mL/min  per 
1.73 m2. The presence of ARAS is a strong predictor of morbidity- and 
mortality-related cardiovascular events, independent of whether renal 
revascularization is undertaken.

DIAGNOSIS OF RENOVASCULAR DISEASE
Diagnostic  approaches  to  renal  artery  stenosis  depend  partly  on  the 
specific clinical questions to be addressed. Noninvasive characteriza-
tion  of  the  renal  vasculature  may  be  achieved  by  several  techniques, 
summarized  in  Table  278-1.  Although  activation  of  the  renin- 
angiotensin system is a key step in developing renovascular hyperten-
sion, it is transient. Levels of renin activity are therefore subject to tim-
ing, the effects of drugs, and sodium intake, and do not reliably predict 
the  response  to  vascular  therapy.  Peak  systolic  renal  artery  velocities 
by Doppler ultrasound >200 cm/s generally predict hemodynamically 
important lesions (>60% vessel lumen occlusion), although some treat-
ment trials have required velocity >300 cm/s to avoid false positives. 
The renal resistive index has predictive value regarding the viability of 
the  kidney.  It  remains  operator-  and  institution-dependent,  however. 
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with vascular recon-
struction  provides  excellent  vascular  images  and  functional  assess-
ment,  but  carries  a  small  risk  of  contrast  toxicity.  It  provides  a  more 
reliable evaluation of accessory vessels and the distal vasculature than 
duplex  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI).  Magnetic  resonance 
angiography  (MRA)  is  now  less  often  used,  as  gadolinium  contrast 
has  been  associated  with  nephrogenic  systemic  fibrosis  particularly 
in patients with reduced GFR. Captopril-enhanced renography has a 
strong negative predictive value when entirely normal.

TREATMENT
Renal Artery Stenosis

While  restoring  renal  blood  flow  and  perfusion  seems  intuitively 
beneficial  for  high-grade  occlusive  lesions,  revascularization  pro-
cedures  also  pose  hazards  and  expense.  Patients  with  FMD  are 
commonly  younger  females  with  otherwise  normal  vessels  and  a 
long  life  expectancy.  These  patients  often  respond  well  to  percu-
taneous  renal  artery  angioplasty.  If  BP  can  be  controlled  to  goal 
levels and kidney function remains stable in patients with ARAS, 
it  may  be  argued  that  medical  therapy  with  follow-up  for  disease 
progression is equally effective over periods of 3–5 years. Multiple 
prospective  randomized  controlled  trials  have  failed  to  identify 
compelling benefits for interventional revascularization procedures 
regarding  short-term  results  of  BP  and  renal  function.  Studies  of 

cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke, congestive heart failure, 
myocardial infarction, and end-stage renal failure, suggest a small 
mortality benefit for stented patients without proteinuria. Medical 
therapy  should  include  blockade  of  the  renin-angiotensin  system, 
attainment  of  goal  BPs,  cessation  of  tobacco,  statins,  and  aspirin. 
Follow-up  requires  surveillance  for  progressive  occlusion  mani-
fest by worsening renal function and/or loss of BP control. Renal 
revascularization is now often reserved for patients failing medical 
therapy or developing additional complications.

Techniques of renal revascularization are improving. With expe-
rienced  operators,  major  complications  occur  in  <5%  of  cases, 
including renal artery dissection, capsular perforation, hemorrhage, 
and  occasional  atheroembolic  disease.  Although  not  common, 
atheroembolic  disease  can  be  catastrophic  and  accelerate  both 
hypertension and kidney failure, precisely the events that revascu-
larization is intended to prevent. Although renal blood flow usually 
can  be  restored  by  endovascular  stenting,  recovery  of  renal  func-
tion is limited to ~25% of cases, with no change in 50% and some 
deterioration evident in others. Patients with rapid loss of kidney 
function, sometimes associated with antihypertensive drug therapy, 
or  with  vascular  disease  affecting  the  entire  functioning  kidney 
mass are more likely to recover function after restoring blood flow. 
When hypertension is refractory to effective therapy, revasculariza-
tion offers real benefits. Table 278-2 summarizes currently accepted 
guidelines  for  considering  renal  revascularization  in  addition  to 
optimal medical therapy.

ATHEROEMBOLIC RENAL DISEASE
Emboli to the kidneys arise most frequently as a result of cholesterol 
crystals  breaking  free  of  atherosclerotic  vascular  plaque  and  lodging 
in  downstream  microvessels.  Most  clinical  atheroembolic  events 
follow  angiographic  procedures,  often  of  the  coronary  vessels.  It  has 
been argued that nearly all vascular interventional procedures lead to 
plaque fracture and release of microemboli, but clinical manifestations 
develop only in a fraction of these. The incidence of clinical atheroem-
boli has been increasing with more vascular procedures and longer life 
spans. Atheroembolic renal disease is suspected in >3% of elderly sub-
jects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is likely underdiagnosed. 
It is more frequent in males with a history of diabetes, hypertension, 
and ischemic cardiac disease. Atheroemboli in the kidney are strongly 
associated  with  aortic  aneurysmal  disease  and  renal  artery  stenosis. 
Most clinically evident cases can be linked to precipitating events, such 
as angiography, vascular surgery, anticoagulation with heparin, throm-
bolytic  therapy,  or  trauma.  Clinical  manifestations  of  this  syndrome

TABLE 278-2  Clinical Factors That Determine the Role of 
Revascularization in Addition to Medical Therapy for Renal Artery 
Stenosis
Factors Favoring Medical Therapy with Revascularization for Renal 
Artery Stenosis

•	 Progressive decline in GFR during treatment of systemic hypertension
•	 Failure to achieve adequate blood pressure control with optimal medical 

therapy (medical failure)

•	 Rapid or recurrent decline in the GFR in association with a reduction in 

systemic pressure

•	 Decline in the GFR during therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs
•	 Recurrent congestive heart failure in a patient in whom left ventricular 

dysfunction does not fully explain the cause

Factors Favoring Medical Therapy and Surveillance of Renal Artery 
Disease

•	 Controlled blood pressure with stable renal function (e.g., stable renal 

insufficiency)

•	 Stable renal artery stenosis without progression on surveillance studies (e.g., 

serial duplex ultrasound)

•	 Advanced age and/or limited life expectancy
•	 Extensive comorbidity that make revascularization too risky
•	 High risk for or previous experience with atheroembolic disease
•	 Other concomitant renal parenchymal diseases that cause progressive renal 
dysfunction (e.g., interstitial nephritis, diabetic nephropathy), particularly with 
proteinuria

blockers; GFR, glomerular filtration rate.

commonly develop between 1 and 14 days after an inciting event and 
may continue to develop for weeks thereafter. Systemic embolic disease 
manifestations,  such  as  fever,  abdominal  pain,  and  weight  loss,  are 
present in less than half of patients, although cutaneous manifestations 
including  livedo  reticularis  and  localized  toe  gangrene  may  be  more 
common. Worsening hypertension and deteriorating kidney function 
are  common,  sometimes  reaching  a  malignant  phase.  Progressive 
renal failure can occur and require dialytic support. These cases often 
develop after a stuttering onset over many weeks and have an ominous 
prognosis. Mortality rate after 1 year exceeds 38%, and although some 
may eventually recover sufficiently to no longer require dialysis, many 
do not.

Beyond  the  clinical  manifestations  above,  laboratory  findings 
include  rising  creatinine,  transient  eosinophilia  (60–80%),  elevated 
sedimentation rate, and hypocomplementemia (15%). Establishing this 
diagnosis can be difficult and is often by exclusion. Definitive diagnosis 
depends on kidney biopsy demonstrating microvessel occlusion with 
cholesterol crystals that leave a “cleft” in the vessel. Biopsies obtained 
from  patients  undergoing  surgical  revascularization  of  the  kidney 
indicate that silent cholesterol emboli are frequently present before any 
further manipulation is performed.

No  effective  therapy  is  available  for  atheroembolic  disease  once  it 
has  developed.  Withdrawal  of  anticoagulation  is  recommended.  Late 
recovery  of  kidney  function  after  supportive  measures  sometimes 
occurs, and statin therapy may improve outcome. The role of embolic 
protection  devices  in  the  renal  circulation  during  angiography  is 
unclear, but a few prospective trials have failed to demonstrate major 
benefits. The effect of such devices is limited to distal protection during 
the endovascular procedure, and they offer no protection from embolic 
debris developing after removal.

THROMBOEMBOLIC RENAL DISEASE
Thrombotic  occlusion  of  renal  vessels  or  branch  arteries  can  lead  to 
declining  renal  function  and  hypertension.  It  is  difficult  to  diagnose 
and  is  often  overlooked,  especially  in  elderly  patients.  Thrombosis 
can develop as a result of local vessel abnormalities, such as local dis-
section,  trauma,  or  inflammatory  vasculitis.  Local  microdissections 
sometimes  lead  to  patchy,  transient  areas  of  infarctions  labeled  “seg-
mental arteriolar mediolysis.” Although hypercoagulability conditions 
sometimes present as renal artery thrombosis, this is rare. It can also 

derive  from  distant  embolic  events,  e.g.,  the  left  atrium  in  patients 
with atrial fibrillation or from fat emboli originating from traumatized 
tissue, most commonly large bone fractures. Cardiac sources include 
vegetations  from  subacute  bacterial  endocarditis.  Systemic  emboli  to 
the kidneys may also arise from the venous circulation if right-to-left 
shunting occurs, e.g., through a patent foramen ovale.

Clinical manifestations vary depending on the rapidity of onset and 
extent of occlusion. Acute arterial thrombosis may produce flank pain, 
fever, leukocytosis, nausea, and vomiting. If kidney infarction results, 
enzymes  such  as  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  rise  transiently  to 
extreme levels. If both kidneys are affected, renal function will decline 
precipitously with a drop in urine output. If a single kidney is involved, 
renal functional changes may be minor. Hypertension related to sud-
den release of renin from ischemic tissue can develop rapidly, as long 
as some viable tissue in the “peri-infarct” border zone remains. If the 
infarct zone demarcates precisely, the rise in BP and renin activity may 
resolve.  Diagnosis  of  renal  infarction  may  be  established  by  vascular 
imaging with CT angiography, MRI, or arteriography (Fig. 278-2).
 ■ MANAGEMENT OF ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS OF 
THE KIDNEY
Options for interventions of newly detected arterial occlusion include 
surgical  reconstruction,  anticoagulation,  thrombolytic  therapy, 
endovascular procedures, and supportive care, particularly antihyper-
tensive  drug  therapy.  Application  of  these  methods  depends  on  the 
patient’s overall condition, the precipitating factors (e.g., local trauma 
or systemic illness), the magnitude of renal tissue and function at risk, 
and the likelihood of recurrent events in the future. For unilateral dis-
ease, for example, arterial dissection with thrombosis and supportive 
care  with  anticoagulation  may  suffice.  Acute,  bilateral  occlusion  is 
potentially catastrophic, producing anuric renal failure. Depending on 
the precipitating event, surgical or thrombolytic therapies can some-
times restore kidney viability if undertaken early in the course of the 
acute event.

MICROVASCULAR INJURY ASSOCIATED 
WITH HYPERTENSION
 ■ ARTERIOLONEPHROSCLEROSIS
“Malignant”  Hypertension  Although  BP  rises  with  age,  it  has 
long  been  recognized  that  some  individuals  develop  rapidly  pro-
gressive  BP  elevations  with  target  organ  injury  including  retinal 
hemorrhages,  encephalopathy,  and  declining  kidney  function.  Pla-
cebo  arms  during  the  early  controlled  trials  of  hypertension  therapy 
identified progression to severe levels in 20% of subjects over 5 years. 
If  untreated,  patients  with  target  organ  injury  including  papilledema 
and  declining  kidney  function  suffered  mortality  rates  in  excess  of 
50% over 6–12 months, hence the designation “malignant.” Postmor-
tem  studies  of  such  patients  identified  vascular  lesions,  designated 
“fibrinoid  necrosis,”  with  breakdown  of  the  vessel  wall,  deposition 
of  eosinophilic  material  including  fibrin,  and  a  perivascular  cellular 
infiltrate.  A  separate  lesion  was  identified  in  the  larger  interlobular 
arteries in many patients with hyperplastic proliferation of the vascular 
wall cellular elements, deposition of collagen, and separation of layers, 
designated the “onionskin” lesion. For many of these patients, fibrinoid 
necrosis led to obliteration of glomeruli and loss of tubular structures. 
Progressive kidney failure ensued and, without dialysis support, led to 
early mortality in untreated malignant-phase hypertension. These vas-
cular changes could develop with pressure-related injury from a variety 
of  hypertensive  pathways,  including  but  not  limited  to  activation  of 
the  renin-angiotensin  system  and  severe  vasospasm  associated  with 
catecholamine release. Occasionally, endothelial injury is sufficient to 
induce microangiopathic hemolysis, as discussed below.

Antihypertensive therapy is the mainstay of therapy for malignant 
hypertension. With effective BP reduction, manifestations of vascular 
injury,  including  microangiopathic  hemolysis  and  renal  dysfunction, 
can improve over time. Whereas prior reports before the era of drug 
therapy  suggested  that  1-year  mortality  rates  exceeded  90%,  current 
survival over 5 years exceeds 50%.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system produced rapidly developing hypertension. B. Angiogram illustrating high-grade renal artery stenosis affecting the left kidney. This 
lesion is often part of widespread atherosclerosis and sometimes is an extension of aortic plaque. This lesion develops in older individuals with preexisting atherosclerotic 
risk factors.

Malignant  hypertension  is  less  common  in  Western  countries, 
although  it  persists  in  parts  of  the  world  where  medical  care  and 
antihypertensive  drug  therapy  are  less  available.  It  most  commonly 
develops  in  patients  with  treated  hypertension  who  neglect  to  take 
medications or who may use vasospastic drugs, such as cocaine. Renal 
abnormalities typically include rising serum creatinine and occasion-
ally  hematuria  and  proteinuria.  Biochemical  findings  may  include 
evidence of hemolysis (anemia, schistocytes, and reticulocytosis) and 
changes  associated  with  kidney  failure.  African-American  males  are 
more  likely  to  develop  rapidly  progressive  hypertension  and  kidney 
failure than are whites in the United States. Genetic polymorphisms for 
APOL1 that are common in the African-American population predis-
pose to focal sclerosing glomerular disease, with severe hypertension 
developing at younger ages secondary to renal disease in this instance.
“Hypertensive  Nephrosclerosis”  Based  on  experience  with 
malignant  hypertension  and  epidemiologic  evidence  linking  BP  with 
long-term risks of kidney failure, it has long been assumed that lesser 
degrees  of  hypertension  induce  less  severe,  but  prevalent,  changes  in 
kidney vessels and loss of kidney function. As a result, a large portion 
of  patients  reaching  ESRD  without  a  specific  etiologic  diagnosis  are 
assigned  the  designation  “hypertensive  nephrosclerosis.”  Pathologic 
examination  commonly  identifies  afferent  arteriolar  thickening  with 
deposition  of  homogeneous  eosinophilic  material  (hyaline  arteriolo-
sclerosis) associated with narrowing of vascular lumina. Clinical man-
ifestations include retinal vessel changes associated with hypertension 
(arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous crossing changes), left ventricular 
hypertrophy,  and  elevated  BP.  The  role  of  these  vascular  changes  in 
kidney  function  is  unclear.  Postmortem  and  biopsy  samples  from 
normotensive kidney donors demonstrate similar vessel changes asso-
ciated with aging, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance. Although BP 
reduction does slow progression of proteinuric kidney diseases and is 
warranted to reduce the excessive cardiovascular risks associated with 
CKD, antihypertensive therapy does not alter the course of kidney dys-
function identified specifically as hypertensive nephrosclerosis.

279 Deep-Venous Thrombosis 
and Pulmonary 
Thromboembolism
Samuel Z. Goldhaber

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  encompasses  deep-venous  throm-
bosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and causes cardiovascular 
death, chronic disability, and emotional distress. In the United States, 
there are an estimated 100,000–180,000 deaths attributed annually to PE.

Beginning  in  2015,  the  life  expectancy  in  the  United  States  has 
decreased, primarily due to more deaths among young and middle-aged 
adults of all racial groups. Drug overdoses, alcoholic liver disease, and 
suicides have garnered the most attention for this increase in midlife

mortality; however, increasing deaths from heart and lung diseases, as 
well  as  hypertension,  stroke,  and  diabetes  mellitus,  help  account  for 
this  unwanted  trend.  The  annual  PE-related  age-standardized  mor-
tality  rate  has  been  increasing  among  young  and  middle-aged  adults 
since 2007 (Fig. 279-1). Among the elderly, the rate of decrease of PE- 
related  mortality  has  slowed.  PE  patients  residing  in  zip  codes  with 
lower  socioeconomic  status  have  increased  in-hospital  mortality.  In 
contrast,  Canada’s  and  Denmark’s  annual  age-standardized  mortality 
rate with PE as the underlying cause of death has decreased across all 
age groups. Europe’s age-standardized annual PE-related mortality rate 
has decreased linearly since year 2000.

In 2020, COVID-19 erupted and caused a global pandemic. The most 
notable clinical feature is a life-threatening acute respiratory syndrome 
requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and causing a high case–
fatality rate. This viral illness also causes extensive DVT and PE, even 
when patients receive standard pharmacologic prophylaxis as soon as 
they  are  hospitalized.  At  autopsy,  about  one-fourth  of  patients  have 
both  macrovascular  and  microvascular  PE.  Arterial  thrombosis  also 
occurs and causes myocardial infarction and stroke. The contributing 
etiologies  of  this  widespread  thrombosis  are  excessive  inflammation 
with cytokine storm, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and 
stasis (Fig. 279-2).

In the United States, Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with acute 
PE  have  a  high  14%  readmission  rate  within  30  days  of  hospital  dis-
charge. The reasons are uncertain, but the high rate suggests that we need 
to improve the transition of care from inpatient to outpatient. In addition 
to survival after PE, we now focus more attention on the quality of life 
after PE. About half of PE patients report persistent dyspnea, fatigue, and 
reduced  exercise  capacity,  and  about  one-quarter  have  persistent  right 
ventricular  dysfunction  on  echocardiogram  following  the  diagnosis  of 
PE. This constellation of findings is being recognized more frequently 
and is called the “post-PE syndrome.” These patients may subsequently 
develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Chronic  thromboembolic  pulmonary  hypertension  causes  breath-
lessness,  especially  with  exertion.  Postthrombotic  syndrome  (also 
known  as  chronic  venous  insufficiency)  damages  the  venous  valves  of 
the leg and worsens the quality of life by causing ankle or calf swell-
ing  and  leg  aching,  especially  after  prolonged  standing.  In  its  most 
severe  form,  postthrombotic  syndrome  causes  deep  skin  ulceration  
(Fig. 279-3).

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Inflammation 
Inflammation takes center stage as a trigger of acute 
PE and DVT. Inflammation-related risk factors and medical illnesses 
are now linked as precipitants of VTE (Table 279-1).

Prothrombotic States  The two most common autosomal domi-
nant genetic mutations are (1) factor V Leiden, which causes resistance 
to the endogenous anticoagulant activated protein C (which inactivates 
clotting factors V and VIII), and (2) the prothrombin gene mutation, 
which  increases  the  plasma  prothrombin  concentration  (Chaps.  65 
and 117). Antithrombin, protein C, and protein S are naturally occur-
ring coagulation inhibitors. Deficiencies of these inhibitors are associ-
ated with VTE but are rare. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an 
acquired (not genetic) thrombophilic disorder that predisposes to both 
venous  and  arterial  thrombosis.  Counterintuitively,  the  presence  of 
genetic mutations such as heterozygous factor V Leiden and prothrombin 
gene mutation does not appear to increase the risk of recurrent VTE. 
However, patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome may war-
rant  indefinite-duration  anticoagulation,  even  if  the  initial  VTE  was 
provoked by trauma or surgery.

Clinical  Risk  Factors  Common  comorbidities  include  cancer, 
obesity,  cigarette  smoking,  systemic  arterial  hypertension,  chronic 
obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  chronic  kidney  disease,  long-haul  air 
travel,  air  pollution,  estrogen-containing  contraceptives,  pregnancy, 
postmenopausal  hormone  replacement,  surgery,  and  trauma.  Seden-
tary lifestyle is increasingly prevalent. A Japanese study found that each 
2 h per day increment of television watching is associated with a 40% 
increased likelihood of fatal PE.

Activated  Platelets  Virchow’s  triad  of  venous  stasis,  hyperco-
agulability,  and  endothelial  injury  leads  to  recruitment  of  activated 
platelets,  which  release  microparticles.  These  microparticles  contain 
proinflammatory mediators that bind neutrophils, stimulating them to 
release their nuclear material and form web-like extracellular networks 
called  neutrophil  extracellular  traps.  These  prothrombotic  networks 
contain  histones  that  stimulate  platelet  aggregation  and  promote 
platelet-dependent  thrombin  generation.  Venous  thrombi  form  and 
flourish in an environment of stasis, low oxygen tension, and upregu-
lation of proinflammatory genes.

Interaction  between  Venous  Thromboembolism  and 
Atherothrombosis  Carotid artery plaque doubles the risk of VTE. 
This observation led to discovery of the broad interaction among VTE, 

acute coronary syndrome, and acute stroke (Fig. 279-4). These three 
conditions  share  similar  risk  factors  and  similar  pathophysiology: 
inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury. Patients who 
suffer VTE are more than twice as likely to have a future myocardial 
infarction or stroke. Conversely, patients with myocardial infarction or 
stroke are more than twice as likely to suffer a future VTE.
Embolization  When  deep-venous  thrombi  (Fig.  279-5)  detach 
from  their  site  of  formation,  they  embolize  to  the  vena  cava,  right 
atrium, and right ventricle, and lodge in the pulmonary arterial circula-
tion, thereby causing acute PE. Paradoxically, these thrombi occasion-
ally embolize to the arterial circulation through a patent foramen ovale

interaction  between  venous 

thromboembolism  and 

or atrial septal defect. Many patients with PE have no evidence of DVT 
because the clot has already embolized to the lungs.

Physiology  The  most  common  gas  exchange  abnormalities  are 
arterial hypoxemia and an increased alveolar-arterial O2 tension gra-
dient, which represents the inefficiency of O2 transfer across the lungs. 
Anatomic dead space increases because breathed gas does not enter gas 
exchange units of the lung. Physiologic dead space increases because 
ventilation to gas exchange units exceeds venous blood flow through 
the pulmonary capillaries (Fig. 279-6).

Other pathophysiologic abnormalities include the following:

1.  Increased  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  due  to  vascular  obstruc-
tion or platelet secretion of vasoconstricting neurohumoral agents 
such  as  serotonin.  Release  of  vasoactive  mediators  can  produce  
ventilation-perfusion mismatching at sites remote from the embolus, 
thereby accounting for discordance between a small PE and a large 
alveolar-arterial O2 gradient.

2.  Impaired  gas  exchange  due  to  increased  alveolar  dead  space  from 
vascular obstruction, hypoxemia from alveolar hypoventilation rel-
ative to perfusion in the nonobstructed lung, right-to-left shunting, 
or impaired carbon monoxide transfer due to loss of gas exchange 
surface.

3.  Alveolar  hyperventilation  due  to  reflex  stimulation  of  irritant 

receptors.

4.  Increased airway resistance due to constriction of airways distal to 

the bronchi.

5.  Decreased  pulmonary  compliance  due  to  lung  edema,  lung  hemor-

rhage, or loss of surfactant.

neurohumoral  mediators  cause  a  rise  in  pulmonary  artery  pressure 
and in pulmonary vascular resistance. When RV wall tension rises, RV 
dilation and dysfunction ensue, with release of the cardiac biomarker, 
brain natriuretic peptide, due to abnormal RV stretch. The interven-
tricular  septum  bulges  into  and  compresses  an  intrinsically  normal 
left ventricle (LV). Diastolic LV dysfunction reduces LV distensibility 
and impairs LV filling. Increased RV wall tension also compresses the 
right coronary artery, limits myocardial oxygen supply, and precipitates 
right  coronary  artery  ischemia  and  RV  microinfarction,  with  release 
of  cardiac  biomarkers  such  as  troponin.  Underfilling  of  the  LV  may 
lead to a fall in LV cardiac output and systemic arterial pressure, with 
consequent circulatory collapse and death (Fig. 279-6).
 ■ CLASSIFICATION OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM 
AND DEEP-VENOUS THROMBOSIS
Pulmonary  Embolism  Massive  (high-risk)  PE  accounts  for 
5–10%  of  cases  and  is  usually  characterized  by  systemic  arterial 
hypotension  and  extensive  thrombosis  affecting  at  least  half  of  the 
pulmonary vasculature. Dyspnea, syncope, hypotension, and cyanosis 
are hallmarks of massive PE. Patients with massive PE may present in 
cardiogenic  shock  and  can  die  from  multisystem  organ  failure.  Sub-
massive (intermediate-risk) PE accounts for 20–25% of patients and 
is  characterized  by  RV  dysfunction  despite  normal  systemic  arterial 
pressure. The combination of right heart failure and release of cardiac 
biomarkers such as troponin indicates a high risk of clinical deteriora-
tion.  Low-risk  PE  constitutes  about  65–75%  of  cases.  These  patients 
have an excellent prognosis.

Deep-Venous Thrombosis  Lower extremity DVT usually begins 
in the calf and can propagate proximally to the popliteal, femoral, and 
iliac veins. Leg DVT is ~10 times more common than upper extremity 
DVT, which is often precipitated by placement of pacemakers, internal 
cardiac defibrillators, or indwelling central venous catheters. The like-
lihood of upper extremity DVT increases as the catheter diameter and 
number of lumens increase. Superficial venous thrombosis usually 
presents with erythema, tenderness, and a “palpable cord.” Patients are 
at  risk  for  extension  of  the  superficial  vein  thrombosis  to  the  deep- 
venous system.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Clinical  Evaluation  PE  is  known  as  “the  Great  Masquerader.” 
Diagnosis is difficult because symptoms and signs are nonspecific. In 
the United States, there appears to be excessive ordering of computed 
tomography  (CT)  pulmonary  angiograms  in  patients  suspected  of 
PE.  In  a  study  of  27  emergency  departments  in  Indiana  and  Dallas-
Fort Worth, where 1.8 million patient encounters were logged, 5% of 
patients  underwent  CT  pulmonary  angiography.  Increased  d-dimer 
correlated with an increased diagnostic yield rate, varying from 1.3% 
in Indiana to 4.8% in Dallas-Fort Worth.

The standard upper of limit of a d-dimer is 500 ng/mL. However, 
guidelines  now  recommend  use  of  an  age-adjusted  d-dimer  when 
ruling out acute PE. The age-adjusted d-dimer applies to patients older 
than 50 years of age with low or intermediate clinical probability of PE. 
To calculate the upper limit of normal d-dimer in these patients, mul-
tiply the age by 10. For example, a 70-year-old patient suspected of PE 
would have 700 ng/mL as the upper limit of normal. The age-adjusted 
d-dimer  does  not  apply  to  patients  suspected  of  acute  DVT.  In  vali-
dation studies, implementing routine use of the age-adjusted d-dimer 
may reduce the number of CT pulmonary angiograms that are ordered 
by about one-third.

The  most  common  symptom  of  PE  is  unexplained  breathlessness. 
When  occult  PE  occurs  concomitantly  with  overt  congestive  heart 
failure or pneumonia, clinical improvement often fails to ensue despite 
standard medical treatment of the concomitant illness. This scenario 
presents a clinical clue to the possible coexistence of PE.

With  DVT,  the  most  common  symptom  is  a  cramp  or  “charley 
horse” in the lower calf that persists and intensifies over several days. 
Wells Point Score criteria help estimate the clinical likelihood of DVT 
and  PE  (Table  279-2).  Patients  with  a  low  likelihood  of  DVT  or  a 
low-to-moderate  likelihood  of  PE  should  undergo  initial  diagnostic 
evaluation  with  d-dimer  testing  alone  (see  “Blood  Tests”)  without 
obligatory imaging tests if the d-dimer test result is negative (Fig. 279-7). 
However, patients with a high clinical likelihood of VTE should skip 
d-dimer testing and undergo imaging as the next step in the diagnostic 
algorithm.

Clinical Pearls  Not all leg pain is due to DVT, and not all dyspnea 
is due to PE (Table 279-3). Sudden, severe calf discomfort suggests a 
ruptured  Baker’s  cyst.  Fever  and  chills  usually  herald  cellulitis  rather 
than DVT. Physical findings, if present, may consist only of mild palpa-
tion discomfort in the lower calf. However, massive DVT often presents 
with marked thigh swelling, tenderness, and erythema. Recurrent left 
thigh edema especially in young women raises the possibility of May-
Thurner syndrome, with right proximal iliac artery compression of the 
left proximal iliac vein. If a leg is diffusely edematous, DVT is unlikely. 
More probable is an acute exacerbation of venous insufficiency due to 
postthrombotic  syndrome.  Upper  extremity  venous  thrombosis  may 
present with asymmetry in the supraclavicular fossa or in the circum-
ference of the upper arms.

FIGURE  279-7  How  to  decide  whether  diagnostic  imaging  is  needed.  For 
assessment of clinical likelihood, see Table 279-2. DVT, deep-venous thrombosis; 
PE, pulmonary embolism.

Pulmonary infarction usually indicates a small PE. This condition is 
exquisitely painful because the thrombus lodges peripherally, near the 
innervation of pleural nerves. Nonthrombotic PE etiologies include fat 
embolism  after  pelvic  or  long  bone  fracture,  tumor  embolism,  bone 
marrow,  and  air  embolism.  Cement  embolism  and  bony  fragment 
embolism can occur after total hip or knee replacement. Intravenous 
drug users may inject themselves with a wide array of substances that 
can embolize, such as hair, talc, and cotton.  Amniotic  fluid  embolism 
occurs when fetal membranes leak or tear at the placental margin.

Nonimaging  Diagnostic  Modalities  •  BLOOD  TESTS  The 
quantitative  plasma  d-dimer  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay 
(ELISA) rises in the presence of DVT or PE because of the breakdown 
of  fibrin  by  plasmin.  Elevation  of  d-dimer  indicates  endogenous 
although  often  clinically  ineffective  thrombolysis.  The  sensitivity  of 
the d-dimer is >80% for DVT (including isolated calf DVT) and >95% 
for PE. The d-dimer is less sensitive for DVT than for PE because the 
DVT thrombus size is smaller. A normal d-dimer is a useful “rule out” 
test for PE. However, the d-dimer assay is not specific. Levels increase 
in patients with myocardial infarction, pneumonia, sepsis, cancer, the 
postoperative state, and those in the second or third trimester of preg-
nancy. Therefore, d-dimer rarely has a useful role among hospitalized 
patients, because levels are frequently elevated due to systemic illness.

FIGURE 279-8  Electrocardiogram with both the S1Q3T3 sign and T-wave inversions in leads V1-V4—typical of an anatomically large pulmonary embolism. This patient’s 
CT pulmonary angiogram is shown as Figures 279-10A and B.

ELEVATED CARDIAC BIOMARKERS  Serum troponin and plasma heart-
type fatty acid–binding protein levels increase because of RV microin-
farction. Myocardial stretch causes release of brain natriuretic peptide 
or NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM  The  most  frequently  cited  abnormality,  in 
addition to sinus tachycardia, is the S1Q3T3 sign: an S wave in lead I, a 
Q wave in lead III, and an inverted T wave in lead III (Chap. 240). This 
finding  is  relatively  specific  but  insensitive.  RV  strain  and  ischemia 
cause the most common abnormality, T-wave inversion in leads V1 to 
V4 (Fig. 279-8).

Noninvasive  Imaging  Modalities  •  VENOUS  ULTRASONOGRAPHY  
Ultrasonography of the deep-venous system relies on loss of vein com-
pressibility as the primary diagnostic criterion for DVT. When a normal 
vein  is  imaged  in  cross-section,  it  readily  collapses  with  gentle  manual 
pressure  on  the  ultrasound  transducer.  This  creates  the  illusion  of  a 
“wink.” With acute DVT, the vein loses its compressibility because of pas-
sive distention by acute thrombus. The diagnosis of acute DVT is even 

more  secure  when  thrombus  is  directly  visualized.  It  appears  homoge-
neous and has low echogenicity (Fig. 279-9). The vein itself often appears 
mildly dilated, and collateral channels may be absent.

Venous  flow  dynamics  can  be  examined  with  Doppler  imaging. 
Normally, manual calf compression causes augmentation of the Dopp-
ler flow pattern. Loss of normal respiratory variation is caused by an 
obstructing DVT or by any obstructive process within the pelvis. For 
patients with a technically poor or nondiagnostic venous ultrasound, 
one should consider alternative imaging modalities for DVT, such as 
CT and magnetic resonance imaging.

CHEST ROENTGENOGRAPHY  A normal or nearly normal chest x-ray 
often  occurs  in  PE.  Well-established  abnormalities  include  focal 
oligemia  (Westermark’s  sign),  a  peripheral  wedge-shaped  density 
usually located at the pleural base (Hampton’s hump), and an enlarged 
right descending pulmonary artery (Palla’s sign).

CHEST CT  CT of the chest with intravenous contrast is the principal 
imaging test for the diagnosis of PE (Fig. 279-10A). Thin-cut chest CT

segmental  perfusion  defects  in  the  presence  of  normal  ventilation. 
The  diagnosis  of  PE  is  very  unlikely  in  patients  with  normal  and 
nearly normal scans and, in contrast, is ~90% certain in patients with 
high-probability scans.
MAGNETIC  RESONANCE  (MR)  (CONTRAST-ENHANCED)  IMAGING  
When ultrasound is equivocal, MR venography with gadolinium con-
trast is an excellent imaging modality to diagnose DVT. MR pulmo-
nary angiography may detect large proximal PE but is not reliable for 
smaller segmental and subsegmental PE.

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY  Echocardiography is not a reliable diagnostic 
imaging tool for acute PE because most patients with PE have normal 
echocardiograms.  However,  echocardiography  is  a  very  useful  diag-
nostic tool for detecting conditions that may mimic PE, such as acute 
myocardial  infarction,  pericardial  tamponade,  and  aortic  dissection. 
Transthoracic echocardiography rarely images thrombus directly. The 
best-known  indirect  sign  of  PE  on  transthoracic  echocardiography 
is  McConnell’s  sign:  hypokinesis  of  the  RV  free  wall  with  normal  or 
hyperkinetic motion of the RV apex. One should consider transesoph-
ageal echocardiography when CT scanning facilities are not available 
or  when  a  patient  has  renal  failure  or  severe  contrast  allergy  that 
precludes administration of contrast despite premedication with high-
dose steroids. This imaging modality can identify saddle, right main, 
or left main PE.

Invasive Diagnostic Modalities  •  PULMONARY ANGIOGRAPHY  
Chest CT with contrast (see above) has virtually replaced invasive pul-
monary angiography as a diagnostic test. Invasive catheter-based diag-
nostic  testing  is  reserved  for  patients  with  technically  unsatisfactory 
chest CTs and for those in whom an interventional procedure such as 
catheter-directed thrombolysis is planned. A definitive diagnosis of PE 
requires visualization of an intraluminal filling defect in more than one 
projection. Secondary signs of PE include abrupt occlusion (“cut-off ”) 
of vessels, segmental oligemia or avascularity, and a prolonged arterial 
phase with slow filling, and tortuous, tapering peripheral vessels.

CONTRAST  PHLEBOGRAPHY  Venous  ultrasonography  has  virtually 
replaced  contrast  phlebography  as  the  principal  diagnostic  test  for 
suspected  DVT.  However,  contrast  phlebography  is  used  when  an 
interventional procedure is planned.

Integrated  Diagnostic  Approach  An  integrated  diagnostic 
approach streamlines the workup of suspected DVT and PE (Fig. 279-11).

TREATMENT
Deep-Venous Thrombosis 

PRIMARY THERAPY
Primary therapy consists of clot dissolution with pharmacomechan-
ical  therapy  using  low-dose  catheter-directed  thrombolysis.  The 
open vein hypothesis postulates that patients who receive primary 
therapy will sustain less long-term damage to venous valves, with 
consequent lower rates of postthrombotic syndrome. However, the 
ATTRACT trial randomized 692 patients with femoral or iliofem-
oral DVT to catheter-directed thrombolysis versus usual care with 
anticoagulation  alone.  After  2  years  of  follow-up,  there  was  no 
overall reduction in postthrombotic syndrome in the thrombolysis 
group. Nevertheless, there was a trend toward less postthrombotic 
syndrome 2 years after randomization among patients with iliofem-
oral DVT (compared with only femoral DVT) who received catheter-
directed thrombolysis compared with anticoagulation alone. 
Asymptomatic  DVT 
In  the  primary  prevention  APEX  trial  sub-
study of patients with asymptomatic DVT, 299 patients with asymp-
tomatic  DVT  were  compared  with  5898  patients  with  no  DVT. 
Those  with  asymptomatic  DVT  had  a  threefold  higher  mortality 
rate. 
Upper  Extremity  DVT  As  peripherally  inserted  central  catheter 
(PICC) use has increased, so has the rate of upper extremity DVT.

images can provide exquisite detail, with ≤1 mm of resolution during a 
short breath hold. Sixth-order branches can be visualized with resolu-
tion superior to that of conventional invasive contrast pulmonary angi-
ography. The CT scan also provides an excellent four-chamber view of 
the  heart  (Fig.  279-10B).  RV  enlargement  on  chest  CT  indicates  an 
increased likelihood of death within the next 30 days compared with 
PE patients who have normal RV size. In patients without PE, the lung 
parenchymal images may establish alternative diagnoses not apparent 
on chest x-ray that explain the presenting symptoms and signs, such 
as pneumonia, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary mass, and 
aortic pathology.
LUNG  SCANNING  Lung  scanning  has  become  a  second-line  diag-
nostic  test  for  PE,  used  mostly  for  patients  who  cannot  tolerate 
intravenous contrast. Small particulate aggregates of albumin labeled 
with a gamma-emitting radionuclide are injected intravenously and 
are  trapped  in  the  pulmonary  capillary  bed.  The  perfusion  scan 
defect indicates absent or decreased blood flow, possibly due to PE. 
Ventilation  scans,  obtained  with  a  radiolabeled  inhaled  gas  such 
as  xenon  or  krypton,  improve  the  specificity  of  the  perfusion  scan. 
Abnormal  ventilation  scans  indicate  abnormal  nonventilated  lung, 
thereby  providing  possible  explanations  for  perfusion  defects  other 
than  acute  PE,  such  as  asthma  and  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary 
disease.  A  high-probability  scan  for  PE  is  defined  as  two  or  more

This rate can be decreased by more judicious selection of patients 
who  require  a  PICC,  use  of  single-lumen  rather  than  double-  or 
triple-lumen  PICCs,  and  use  of  the  smallest  possible  lumen  size, 
ideally 4 French rather than 5 or 6 French. 
Isolated Calf DVT  The GARFIELD-VTE Registry recruited 2145 
patients  with  isolated  calf  DVT  and  3846  patients  with  proximal 
DVT  with  or  without  calf  DVT.  Isolated  calf  DVT  patients  were 
more likely to have either undergone surgery or have experienced 
leg trauma, and they were less likely to have active cancer or a prior 
history  of  VTE.  Almost  all  isolated  calf  DVT  patients  received 
anticoagulation,  and  nearly  half  were  anticoagulated  for  at  least   
1 year. In a smaller study of 871 patients with leg DVT, the 10-year 
mortality was the same in patients with isolated calf DVT compared 
to  those  with  proximal  leg  DVT.  Cancer-associated  isolated  calf 
DVT  had  as  high  a  recurrence  rate  as  cancer-associated  proximal 
leg DVT. 
SECONDARY PREVENTION
Anticoagulation  or  placement  of  an  inferior  vena  cava  (IVC)  filter 
constitutes secondary prevention of VTE. IVC filters are indicated in 
patients with an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation and for 
those who have suffered recurrent VTE while receiving therapeutic 
doses of anticoagulation. Under most circumstances, IVC filters are 
not indicated for primary prevention of VTE. The IVC filter should be 
retrieved if the clinician judges that the patient no longer requires it.
For patients with swelling of the legs when acute DVT is diag-
nosed,  below-knee  graduated  compression  stockings  may  be  pre-
scribed,  usually  30–40  mmHg  or  20–30  mmHg,  to  lessen  patient 

discomfort. They should be replaced every 3 months because they 
lose their elasticity. However, prescription of vascular compression 
stockings  in  asymptomatic  newly  diagnosed  acute  DVT  patients 
does not prevent the development of postthrombotic syndrome.

TREATMENT
Pulmonary Embolism 

RISK STRATIFICATION
Hemodynamic  instability,  RV  dysfunction  on  echocardiography, 
RV  enlargement  on  chest  CT,  and  elevation  of  the  troponin  level 
due to RV microinfarction portend a high risk of an adverse clinical 
outcome despite anticoagulation. When RV function remains nor-
mal in a hemodynamically stable patient, a good clinical outcome is 
highly likely with anticoagulation alone (Fig. 279-12). 
ANTICOAGULATION
Effective  anticoagulation  is  the  foundation  for  successful  treat-
ment  of  DVT  and  PE.  There  are  three  major  strategies:  (1)  the 
classical  but  waning  strategy  of  parenteral  anticoagulation  with 
unfractionated  heparin  (UFH), 
low-molecular-weight  heparin 
(LMWH),  or  fondaparinux  “bridged”  to  warfarin;  (2)  parenteral 
therapy, switched after 5 days to a novel oral anticoagulant such as 
dabigatran  (a  direct  thrombin  inhibitor)  or  edoxaban  (an  anti-Xa 
agent); or (3) oral anticoagulation monotherapy with rivaroxaban 
or apixaban (both are anti-Xa agents) with a 3-week or 1-week load-
ing dose, respectively, followed by a maintenance dose. For patients 
with  VTE  in  the  setting  of  suspected  or  proven  heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia, one can choose between two parenteral direct 
thrombin inhibitors: argatroban and bivalirudin (Table 279-4). 
Unfractionated Heparin  UFH binds to and accelerates the activity 
of  antithrombin,  thus  preventing  additional  thrombus  formation. 
UFH is dosed to achieve a target activated partial thromboplastin 
time (aPTT) of 60–80 s. Use an initial bolus of 80 U/kg, followed by 
an initial infusion rate of 18 U/kg per h in patients with normal liver 
function. The short half-life of UFH is especially useful in patients 
in  whom  hour-to-hour  control  of  the  intensity  of  anticoagulation 
is  desired.  Heparin  also  has  pleiotropic  effects  that  may  decrease 
systemic and local inflammation. 
Low-Molecular-Weight  Heparins  These  fragments  of  UFH 
exhibit  less  binding  to  plasma  proteins  and  endothelial  cells  and 
consequently  have  greater  bioavailability,  a  more  predictable  dose 
response, and a longer half-life than does UFH. No monitoring or 
dose adjustment is needed unless the patient is markedly obese or 
has chronic kidney disease. 
Fondaparinux  Fondaparinux, an anti-Xa pentasaccharide, is essen-
tially an ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin. It is administered as

Warfarin Anticoagulation

Requires 5–10 days of administration to achieve effectiveness as monotherapy
Use full-dose unfractionated heparin, LMWH, or fondaparinux as “bridging 
agents” when initiating warfarin. Continue parenteral anticoagulation for a 
minimum of 5 days and until two sequential INR values, at least 1 day apart, 
achieve the target INR range.
Usual start dose is 5 mg

a  weight-based  once-daily  subcutaneous  injection  in  a  prefilled 
syringe.  No  laboratory  monitoring  is  required.  Fondaparinux  is 
synthesized  in  a  laboratory  and,  unlike  LMWH  or  UFH,  is  not 
derived from animal products. It does not cause heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia.  The  dose  must  be  adjusted  downward  for 
patients with renal dysfunction. 
Warfarin  This  vitamin  K  antagonist  prevents  carboxylation- 
dependent activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X (Chap-
ter 65). The full effect of warfarin requires daily therapy for at least 5 
days. Overlapping UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux, or parenteral direct 
thrombin inhibitors with warfarin for at least 5 days will nullify the 
early procoagulant effect of warfarin. The dose of warfarin is usually 
targeted to achieve a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 
2.5, with a range of 2.0–3.0. Hundreds of drug-drug and drug-food 
interactions affect warfarin metabolism. Warfarin can cause major 
hemorrhage,  including  intracranial  hemorrhage,  even  when  the 
INR  remains  within  the  desired  therapeutic  range.  Warfarin  can 
also cause “off-target” side effects such as alopecia or arterial vascu-
lar calcification. Centralized anticoagulation clinics have improved 
the efficacy and safety of warfarin dosing. Some patients can self-
monitor their INR with a home point-of-care fingerstick machine, 
and a few can be taught to self-dose their warfarin. 
Novel  Oral  Anticoagulants  Novel  oral  anticoagulants  (NOACs) 
are administered in a fixed dose, establish effective anticoagulation 
within hours of ingestion, require no laboratory coagulation moni-
toring and no restriction on eating green leafy vegetables, and have 
few drug-drug interactions. 
Management of Bleeding from Anticoagulants  For life-threatening or 
intracranial hemorrhage due to heparin or LMWH, administer pro-
tamine sulfate. The dabigatran antibody idarucizumab is an effective, 
rapidly acting antidote for dabigatran. Andexanet reverses the bleed-
ing  complications  from  the  anti-Xa  anticoagulants.  Major  bleeding 
from warfarin is best managed with prothrombin complex concen-
trate. With less serious bleeding, fresh-frozen plasma or intravenous 
vitamin  K  can  be  used.  Oral  vitamin  K  is  effective  for  managing 
minor bleeding or an excessively high INR in the absence of bleeding.

TABLE 279-5  Take-Home Points from the European Society of 
Cardiology 2019 Pulmonary Embolism Guidelines
1.  Terminology such as “provoked” versus “unprovoked” PE/DVT is no longer 

supported by the Guidelines, as it is potentially misleading and not helpful for 
decision-making regarding the duration of anticoagulation.

2.  Extended oral anticoagulation of indefinite duration should be considered for 

patients with a first episode of PE and:
a.  No identifiable risk factor
b.  A persistent risk factor
c.  A minor transient or reversible risk factor

Abbreviations: PE, pulmonary embolism; VTE, venous thromboembolism.

Cancer  and  Venous  Thromboembolism  For  patients  with  cancer 
and  VTE,  prescribe  LMWH  as  monotherapy  or  a  NOAC  in  the 
absence of a gastrointestinal cancer, and continue extended-duration 
anticoagulation until the patient is declared cancer-free. 
Duration  of  Anticoagulation  Based  on  contemporary  observa-
tional and randomized trials, data-driven guidelines have changed 
fundamentally our conceptual approach to determining the optimal 
duration of anticoagulation. We should no longer try to classify a 
VTE as “provoked” or “unprovoked.” The reason is that many types 
of provoked VTE lead to as great a risk of recurrence after anticoag-
ulation is discontinued as unprovoked VTE. The European Society 
of Cardiology (ESC) Pulmonary Embolism Guidelines, rewritten in 
2019, are instructive in this regard (Tables 279-5 and 279-6). 
INFERIOR VENA CAVA FILTERS
The two principal indications for insertion of an IVC filter are (1) 
active  bleeding  that  precludes  anticoagulation  and  (2)  recurrent 
venous thrombosis despite intensive anticoagulation. Prevention of 
recurrent PE in patients with right heart failure who are not candi-
dates for fibrinolysis and prophylaxis of extremely high-risk patients 
are “softer” indications for filter placement. The filter itself may fail 
by permitting the passage of small- to medium-size clots via collat-
eral veins that develop. Paradoxically, by providing a nidus for clot 
formation, filters increase the DVT rate, even though they usually 
prevent  PE.  Consider  placing  retrievable  rather  than  permanent 
filters.  The  retrievable  filters  can  be  removed  many  months  after 
insertion, unless thrombus forms and is trapped within the filter. 
MANAGEMENT OF MASSIVE PE
For patients with massive PE and hypotension, replete volume with 
500 mL of normal saline. Additional fluid should be infused with 
extreme caution because excessive fluid administration exacerbates 
RV  wall  stress,  causes  more  profound  RV  ischemia,  and  worsens 
LV compliance and filling by causing further interventricular septal 
shift  toward  the  LV.  Norepinephrine  and  dobutamine  are  first-
line  vasopressor  and  inotropic  agents,  respectively,  for  treatment 
of  PE-related  shock.  Norepinephrine  increases  RV  inotropy  and 
systemic  arterial  pressure.  It  also  restores  the  coronary  perfusion

gradient.  Dobutamine  increases  RV  inotropy  and  lowers  filling 
pressures. It may worsen systemic arterial hypotension unless used 
in  combination  with  a  vasopressor.  Maintain  a  low  threshold  for 
initiating these pressors. If heroic measures are warranted, consider 
veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This 
strategy should only be employed when ECMO is being used as a 
“bridge” to definitive treatment with thrombolysis or embolectomy. 
FIBRINOLYSIS
Successful  fibrinolytic  therapy  rapidly  reverses  right  heart  failure 
and  may  result  in  a  lower  rate  of  death  and  recurrent  PE  by  (1) 
dissolving much of the anatomically obstructing pulmonary arterial 
thrombus,  (2)  preventing  the  continued  release  of  serotonin  and 
other  neurohumoral  factors  that  exacerbate  pulmonary  hyperten-
sion, and (3) lysing much of the source of the thrombus in the pelvic 
or deep leg veins, thereby decreasing the likelihood of recurrent PE.
The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)–approved  sys-
temically administered fibrinolytic regimen is 100 mg of recombi-
nant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) prescribed as a continuous 
peripheral intravenous infusion over 2 h. The sooner thrombolysis is 
administered, the more effective it is. However, this approach can be 
used for at least 14 days after the PE has occurred. A popular off-la-
bel  dosing  regimen  is  50  mg  of  TPA  administered  over  2  h.  This 
lower dose may be associated with fewer bleeding complications.

Contraindications  to  fibrinolysis  include  intracranial  disease, 
recent  surgery,  and  trauma.  The  overall  major  bleeding  rate  is 
~10%,  including  a  2–3%  risk  of  intracranial  hemorrhage.  Careful 
screening  of  patients  for  contraindications  to  fibrinolytic  therapy 
(Chap. 275) is the best way to minimize bleeding risk.

For  patients  with  submassive  PE  who  have  preserved  systolic 
blood  pressure  but  moderate  or  severe  RV  dysfunction,  use  of 
fibrinolysis  remains  controversial.  A  2019  American  Heart  Asso-
ciation Scientific Statement suggests considering advanced therapy 
with thrombolysis or embolectomy in patients with lack of improve-
ment, clinical deterioration, severe physical distress with anticoag-
ulation  alone,  clot  in  transit,  severe  or  persistent  RV  strain,  signs 
of low cardiac output, low bleeding risk, and good life expectancy. 
PHARMACOMECHANICAL CATHETER-DIRECTED THERAPY
Pharmacomechanical  catheter-directed  therapy  usually  combines 
physical fragmentation or pulverization of thrombus with catheter-
directed  low-dose  thrombolysis.  Mechanical  techniques  include 
catheter maceration and intentional embolization of clot more dis-
tally,  suction  thrombectomy,  rheolytic  hydrolysis,  and  low-energy 
ultrasound-facilitated  thrombolysis.  With  pharmacomechanical 
catheter-directed  therapy,  the  dose  of  alteplase  can  be  markedly 
reduced,  usually  to  a  range  of  20–25  mg,  instead  of  the  periph-
eral  intravenous  systemic  dose  of  100  mg.  In  2014,  the  FDA 
approved  ultrasound-facilitated  catheter-directed  thrombolysis 
for  acute  massive  and  submassive  PE.  Using  a  total  tPA  dose  of   
24 mg administered over 12 h, this approach decreased RV dilation, 
reduced  pulmonary  hypertension,  decreased  anatomic  thrombus 
burden, and minimized intracranial hemorrhage. Lower doses and 
shorter durations of TPA are currently being studied. 
PULMONARY EMBOLECTOMY
The  risk  of  major  hemorrhage  with  systemically  administered 
fibrinolysis  has  prompted  a  renaissance  of  interest  in  surgical 
embolectomy, an operation that had almost become extinct. More 
rapid  referral  before  the  onset  of  irreversible  multisystem  organ 
failure  and  improved  surgical  technique  have  resulted  in  a  high 
survival rate. 

PULMONARY THROMBOENDARTERECTOMY
Chronic  thromboembolic  pulmonary  hypertension  develops  in 
2–4% of acute PE patients. Therefore, PE patients who have initial 
pulmonary hypertension (usually diagnosed with Doppler echocar-
diography) should be followed up at about 6 weeks and, if necessary, 
at  6  months,  with  repeat  echocardiograms  to  determine  whether 
pulmonary arterial pressure has normalized. Patients impaired by 

dyspnea  due  to  chronic  thromboembolic  pulmonary  hyperten-
sion should be considered for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, 
which, when successful, can markedly reduce, and sometimes even 
cure, pulmonary hypertension (Chap. 283). The operation requires 
median  sternotomy,  cardiopulmonary  bypass,  deep  hypothermia, 
and periods of hypothermic circulatory arrest. The mortality rate at 
experienced centers is ~5%. Inoperable patients should be managed 
with  pulmonary  vasodilator  therapy  and  balloon  angioplasty  of 
pulmonary arterial webs. 

EMOTIONAL SUPPORT
Patients  with  VTE  may  feel  overwhelmed  when  they  learn  that 
they  are  suffering  from  PE  or  DVT.  Some  have  never  previously 
encountered serious cardiovascular illness. They fear they will not 
be  able  to  adapt  to  the  new  limitations  imposed  by  anticoagula-
tion. They worry about the health of their families and the genetic 
implications of their illness. Those who are advised to discontinue 
anticoagulation  may  feel  especially  vulnerable  about  the  potential 
for  suffering  recurrent  VTE.  At  Brigham  and  Women’s  Hospital, 
a  physician-nurse–facilitated  PE  support  group  was  initiated  to 
address  these  concerns  and  has  met  monthly  for  >30  years.  The 
nonprofit organization North American Thrombosis Forum (www 
.NATFonline.org) has initiated monthly online support groups that 
garner worldwide participation.

 ■ PREVENTION OF VTE
Prevention of DVT and PE (Table 279-7) is of paramount importance 
because VTE is difficult to detect and poses a profound medical and 
economic  burden.  Low-dose  UFH  or  LMWH  is  the  most  common 
form of in-hospital prophylaxis. Computerized reminder systems can

280 Diseases of the Aorta

Mark A. Creager, Joseph Loscalzo

The  aorta  is  the  conduit  through  which  blood  ejected  from  the  left 
ventricle is delivered to the systemic arterial bed. In adults, its diam-
eter  is  ~3  cm  at  the  origin  and  in  the  ascending  portion,  2.5  cm  in 
the descending portion in the thorax, and 1.8–2 cm in the abdomen. 
The  aortic  wall  consists  of  a  thin  intima  composed  of  endothelium, 
subendothelial  connective  tissue,  and  an  internal  elastic  lamina;  a 
thick tunica media composed of smooth muscle cells and extracellular 
matrix;  and  an  adventitia  composed  primarily  of  connective  tissue 
enclosing  the  vasa  vasorum  and  nervi  vascularis.  In  addition  to  the 
conduit function of the aorta, its viscoelastic and compliant properties 
serve  a  buffering  function.  The  aorta  is  distended  during  systole  to 
allow a portion of the stroke volume and elastic energy to be stored, 
and  it  recoils  during  diastole  so  that  blood  continues  to  flow  to  the 
periphery. Owing to its continuous exposure to high pulsatile pressure

and shear stress, the aorta is particularly prone to injury and disease 
resulting from mechanical trauma. The aorta is also more prone to rup-
ture than is any other vessel, especially with the development of aneu-
rysmal dilation, since its wall tension, as governed by Laplace’s law (i.e., 
proportional to the product of pressure and radius), will be increased.

CONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF THE AORTA
Congenital anomalies of the aorta usually involve the aortic arch and 
its  branches.  Symptoms  such  as  dysphagia,  stridor,  and  cough  may 
occur if an anomaly causes a ring around or otherwise compresses the 
esophagus  or  trachea.  Anomalies  associated  with  symptoms  include 
double  aortic  arch,  origin  of  the  right  subclavian  artery  distal  to  the 
left subclavian artery, and right-sided aortic arch with an aberrant left 
subclavian artery. A Kommerell’s diverticulum is an anatomic remnant 
of a right aortic arch. Most congenital anomalies of the aorta do not 
cause  symptoms  and  are  detected  during  catheter-based  procedures. 
The diagnosis of suspected congenital anomalies of the aorta typically 
is confirmed by computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance 
(MR) angiography. Surgery is used to treat symptomatic anomalies.

Coarctation  of  the  aorta  (Chap.  269)  typically  occurs  near  the 
insertion of the ligamentum arteriosum, adjacent to the left subclavian 
artery.  It  may  be  associated  with  a  bicuspid  aortic  valve,  aortic  arch 
hypoplasia,  other  congenital  heart  defects,  and  intracranial  aneu-
rysms.  A  pulse  delay  or  pressure  differential  between  the  upper  and 
lower extremities should raise suspicion of aortic coarctation. Imaging 
modalities, including echocardiography, CT, and MR angiography are 
used to confirm the diagnosis. If untreated, hypertension develops in 
the  arteries  proximal  to  the  coarctation.  Treatment  of  hemodynami-
cally significant aortic coarctation includes endovascular stent implan-
tation if feasible or surgical repair.

AORTIC ANEURYSM
An aneurysm is defined as a pathologic dilation of a segment of a blood 
vessel. A true aneurysm involves all three layers of the vessel wall and is 
distinguished from a pseudoaneurysm, in which the intimal and medial 
layers  are  disrupted  and  the  dilated  segment  of  the  aorta  is  lined  by 
adventitia only and, at times, by perivascular clot. Aneurysms also may 
be classified according to their gross appearance. A fusiform aneurysm 
affects  the  entire  circumference  of  a  segment  of  the  vessel,  resulting 
in a diffusely dilated artery. In contrast, a saccular aneurysm involves 
only a portion of the circumference, resulting in an outpouching of the 
vessel wall. Aortic aneurysms also are classified according to location, 
i.e., abdominal versus thoracic. Aneurysms of the descending thoracic 
aorta are usually contiguous with infradiaphragmatic aneurysms and 
are referred to as thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.

 ■ ETIOLOGY
Aortic  aneurysms  result  from  conditions  that  cause  degradation  or 
abnormal production of the structural components of the aortic wall: 
elastin and collagen. The causes of aortic aneurysms may be broadly 
categorized  as  degenerative  disorders,  genetic  or  developmental  dis-
eases, vasculitis, infections, and trauma (Table 280-1). Inflammation, 
oxidative stress, proteolysis, and biomechanical wall stress contribute 
to  the  degenerative  processes  that  characterize  most  aneurysms  of 
the abdominal and descending thoracic aorta. These are mediated by 
B-cell and T-cell lymphocytes, macrophages, inflammatory cytokines, 
and  matrix  metalloproteinases  that  degrade  elastin  and  collagen  and 
alter the tensile strength and ability of the aorta to accommodate pulsa-
tile stretch. The associated histopathology demonstrates destruction of 
elastin and collagen, decreased vascular smooth muscle, in-growth of 
new blood vessels, and inflammation. Factors associated with degener-
ative aortic aneurysms include aging, cigarette smoking, hypercholes-
terolemia, hypertension, and male sex.

The  most  common  pathologic  condition  associated  with  degen-
erative  aortic  aneurysms  is  atherosclerosis.  Many  patients  with  aortic 
aneurysms  have  coexisting  risk  factors  for  atherosclerosis,  as  well  as 
atherosclerosis in other blood vessels.

The pathologic condition of aortic aneurysms associated with genetic 
or  developmental  diseases  is  medial  degeneration,  a  histopathologic

term  used  to  describe  the  degeneration  of  collagen  and  elastic  fibers 
in the tunica media of the aorta as well as the loss of medial cells that 
are  replaced  by  multiple  clefts  of  mucoid  material,  such  as  proteo-
glycans.  Medial  degeneration  characteristically  affects  the  proximal 
aorta,  results  in  circumferential  weakness  and  dilation,  and  leads  to 
the development of fusiform aneurysms involving the ascending aorta 
and the sinuses of Valsalva. Found in patients with Marfan’s syndrome, 
Loeys-Dietz  syndrome,  Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome  type  IV  (Chap. 
413),  hypertension,  bicuspid  aortic  valves,  Turner’s  syndrome,  and 
familial thoracic aortic aneurysm syndromes, it sometimes appears as 
an  isolated  condition  in  patients  without  any  other  apparent  disease. 
Thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms also occur in patients with 

fibromuscular dysplasia, although the nature of the aortic pathology is 
not established.

Familial  clusterings  of  aortic  aneurysms  occur  in  20%  of  patients, 
suggesting  a  hereditary  basis  for  the  disease.  Mutations  of  the  gene 
that encodes fibrillin-1 are present in patients with Marfan’s syndrome. 
Fibrillin-1  is  an  important  component  of  extracellular  microfibrils, 
which  support  the  architecture  of  elastic  fibers  and  other  connec-
tive  tissue.  Deficiency  of  fibrillin-1  in  the  extracellular  matrix  leads 
to  excessive  signaling  by  transforming  growth  factor  β  (TGF-β). 
Loeys-Dietz syndrome is caused by mutations in the genes that encode 
TGF-β  receptors  1  (TGFBR1)  and  2  (TGFBR2).  Increased  signaling 
by  TGF-β  and  mutations  of  TGFBR1,  TGFBR2,  TGFBR3,  as  well  as 
TGFB2 and TGFB3, may cause thoracic aortic aneurysms. Mutations 
of  SMAD3,  which  encodes  a  downstream  signaling  protein  involved 
with TGF binding to its receptors, have been described in a syndrome 
of  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm;  craniofacial,  skeletal,  and  cutaneous 
anomalies; and osteoarthritis. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is associated 
with  autosomal  dominant  polycystic  kidney  disease,  which  is  caused 
by mutations in PKD1. Mutations of the genes encoding the smooth  
muscle–specific alpha-actin (ACTA2), smooth muscle cell–specific myo-
sin heavy chain 11 (MHC11), myosin light chain kinase (MYLK), and type 
I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKG1) and mutations of TGFBR2 
and  SMAD3  have  been  reported  in  some  patients  with  nonsyndromic 
familial  thoracic  aortic  aneurysms.  Mutations  in  type  III  procollagen 
(COL3A1) have been implicated in Ehlers-Danlos type IV syndrome.

The  infectious  causes  of  aortic  aneurysms  include  syphilis,  tuber-
culosis,  and  other  bacterial  infections.  Syphilis  (Chap. 182)  is  a  rela-
tively uncommon cause of aortic aneurysm. Syphilitic periaortitis and 
mesoaortitis damage elastic fibers, resulting in thickening and weaken-
ing of the aortic wall. Approximately 90% of syphilitic aneurysms are 
located in the ascending aorta or aortic arch. Tuberculous aneurysms 
(Chap. 178) typically affect the thoracic aorta and result from direct 
extension of infection from hilar lymph nodes or contiguous abscesses 
as well as from bacterial seeding. Loss of aortic wall elasticity results 
from granulomatous destruction of the medial layer. A mycotic aneu-
rysm  is  a  rare  condition  that  develops  as  a  result  of  staphylococcal, 
streptococcal, Salmonella, or other bacterial or fungal infections of the 
aorta, usually at an atherosclerotic plaque. These aneurysms are usually 
saccular. Blood cultures are often positive and reveal the nature of the 
infective agent.

Vasculitides  associated  with  aortic  aneurysm  include  Takayasu’s 
arteritis and giant cell arteritis, which may cause aneurysms of the aor-
tic arch and descending thoracic aorta. Spondyloarthropathies such as 
ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, relaps-
ing polychondritis, and reactive arthritis are associated with dilation of 
the ascending aorta. Aortic aneurysms occur in patients with Behçet’s 
syndrome (Chap. 364), Cogan’s syndrome, and IgG4-related systemic 
disease.  Aortic  aneurysms  also  result  from  idiopathic  aortitis.  Trau-
matic aneurysms may occur after penetrating or nonpenetrating chest 
trauma and most commonly affect the descending thoracic aorta just 
beyond  the  site  of  insertion  of  the  ligamentum  arteriosum.  Chronic 
aortic dissections are associated with weakening of the aortic wall that 
may lead to the development of aneurysmal dilatation.

 ■ THORACIC AORTIC ANEURYSMS
The  clinical  manifestations  and  natural  history  of  thoracic  aortic 
aneurysms depend on their location. Medial degeneration is the most 
common  pathology  associated  with  ascending  aortic  aneurysms, 
whereas  atherosclerosis  is  the  condition  most  frequently  associated 
with aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta. The average growth 
rate  of  thoracic  aneurysms  is  0.1–0.2  cm  per  year.  Thoracic  aortic 
aneurysms associated with Marfan’s syndrome or aortic dissection may 
expand at a greater rate. The risk of rupture is related to the size of the 
aneurysm and the presence of symptoms, ranging approximately from 
2–3% per year for thoracic aortic aneurysms <4.0 cm in diameter to 7% 
per year for those >6 cm in diameter. Most thoracic aortic aneurysms 
are asymptomatic; however, compression or erosion of adjacent tissue 
by  aneurysms  may  cause  symptoms  such  as  chest  pain,  shortness  of 
breath, cough, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Aneurysmal dilation of the

TREATMENT
Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms

β-Adrenergic  blockers  currently  are  recommended  for  patients 
with  thoracic  aortic  aneurysms,  particularly  those  with  Marfan’s 
syndrome,  who  have  evidence  of  aortic  root  dilatation  to  reduce 
the rate of further expansion. Additional medical therapy should be 
given  as  necessary  to  control  hypertension.  Angiotensin  receptor 
antagonists may reduce the rate of aortic dilation in patients with 
Marfan’s syndrome by blocking TGF-β signaling. Clinical outcome 
trials have found that the rate of aortic root enlargement in patients 
with  Marfan’s  syndrome  was  similar  with  atenolol  and  losartan. 
Operative  repair  with  placement  of  a  prosthetic  graft  is  indicated 
in patients with symptomatic ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms, 
and for most asymptomatic aneurysms, including those associated 
with bicuspid aortic valves when the aortic root or ascending aor-
tic  diameter  is  ≥5.5  cm,  or  when  the  growth  rate  is  >0.5  cm  per 
year. Replacement of the ascending aorta >4.5 cm is reasonable in 
patients with bicuspid aortic valves undergoing aortic valve replace-
ment  because  of  severe  aortic  stenosis  or  aortic  regurgitation.  In 
patients  with  Marfan’s  syndrome,  ascending  thoracic  aortic  aneu-
rysms of 4–5 cm should be considered for surgery. Operative repair 
is indicated for patients with degenerative descending thoracic aor-
tic aneurysms when the diameter is >6 cm, and endovascular repair 
should  be  considered  if  feasible  when  the  diameter  is  >5.5  cm.   
Repair  is  also  recommended  when  the  diameter  of  a  descending 
thoracic aortic aneurysm has increased >1 cm per year.

 ■ ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSMS
Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur more frequently in males than in 
females, and the incidence increases with age. Cigarette smoking is a 
potent  modifiable  risk  factor.  Abdominal  aortic  aneurysms  ≥4.0  cm 
may  affect  1–2%  men  aged  >50  years.  At  least  90%  of  all  abdominal 
aortic  aneurysms  >4.0  cm  are  related  to  atherosclerotic  disease,  and 
most  of  these  aneurysms  are  below  the  level  of  the  renal  arteries. 
Prognosis is related to both the size of the aneurysm and the severity 
of  coexisting  coronary  artery  and  cerebrovascular  disease.  The  risk 
of rupture increases with the size of the aneurysm: the 5-year risk for 
aneurysms <5 cm is 1–2%, whereas it is 20–40% for aneurysms >5 cm 
in diameter. The formation of mural thrombi within aneurysms may 
predispose to peripheral embolization.

An abdominal aortic aneurysm commonly produces no symptoms. 
It usually is detected on routine examination as a palpable, pulsatile, 
expansile, and nontender mass, or it is an incidental finding observed 
on  an  abdominal  imaging  study  performed  for  other  reasons.  As 
abdominal  aortic  aneurysms  expand,  however,  they  may  become 
painful. Some patients complain of strong pulsations in the abdomen; 
others experience pain in the chest, lower back, or scrotum. Aneurys-
mal  pain  is  usually  a  harbinger  of  rupture  and  represents  a  medical 
emergency. More often, acute rupture occurs without any prior warn-
ing,  and  this  complication  is  always  life-threatening.  Rarely,  there  is 
leakage of the aneurysm with severe pain and tenderness. Acute pain 
and hypotension occur with rupture of the aneurysm, which requires 
an emergency operation or endovascular repair.

Abdominal  radiography  may  demonstrate  the  calcified  outline 
of  the  aneurysm;  however,  ~25%  of  aneurysms  are  not  calcified  and 
cannot be visualized by x-ray imaging. An abdominal ultrasound can 
delineate the transverse and longitudinal dimensions of an abdominal 
aortic  aneurysm  and  may  detect  mural  thrombus.  Abdominal  ultra-
sound is useful for serial documentation of aneurysm size and can be 
used to screen patients at risk for developing an aortic aneurysm. In 
one  large  study,  ultrasound  screening  of  men  aged  65–74  years  was 
associated  with  a  risk  reduction  in  aneurysm-related  death  of  42%. 
In  a  meta-analysis  of  population-based  randomized  clinical  trials, 
ultrasound  screening  of  men  aged  65  years  or  older  was  associated 
with a 35% risk reduction in aneurysm-related death over 12–15 years. 
Screening by ultrasonography is recommended for men aged 65–75 years 
who  have  ever  smoked.  The  benefits  of  screening  women  aged

ascending aorta may cause congestive heart failure as a consequence of 
aortic  regurgitation,  and  compression  of  the  superior  vena  cava  may 
produce congestion of the head, neck, and upper extremities.

A  chest  x-ray  may  be  the  first  test  that  suggests  the  diagnosis  of 
a  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm  (Fig.  280-1).  Findings  include  widening 
of  the  mediastinal  shadow  and  displacement  or  compression  of  the 
trachea  or  left  main  stem  bronchus.  Echocardiography,  particularly 
transesophageal echocardiography, can be used to assess the proximal 
ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta. Contrast-enhanced CT, 
magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  and  conventional  invasive  aor-
tography are sensitive and specific tests for assessment of aneurysms 
of the thoracic aorta and involvement of branch vessels (Fig. 280-2). 
In  asymptomatic  patients  whose  aneurysms  are  too  small  to  justify 
surgery, noninvasive testing with either contrast-enhanced CT or MRI 
should be performed at least every 6–12 months to monitor expansion.

65–75  years  who  have  ever  smoked  is  not  established.  In  addition, 
male and female siblings or offspring of persons with abdominal aortic 
aneurysms,  as  well  as  individuals  with  thoracic  aortic  or  peripheral 
arterial aneurysms, should be considered for screening for abdominal 
aortic aneurysms. CT with contrast and MRI are accurate noninvasive 
tests to determine the location and size of abdominal aortic aneurysms 
and to plan endovascular or open surgical repair (Fig. 280-3). Contrast 
aortography  may  be  used  for  the  evaluation  of  patients  with  aneu-
rysms, but the procedure carries a small risk of complications such as 
bleeding, allergic reactions, and atheroembolism. Since the presence of 
mural thrombi may reduce the luminal size, aortography may underes-
timate the diameter of an aneurysm.

TREATMENT
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms

Statins  are  indicated  to  reduce  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  events 
related to atherosclerosis. Medical therapies, such as β-adrenergic 
blockers and renin-angiotensin inhibitors, have not proven effective 
in  reducing  the  rate  of  aneurysm  growth.  Operative  repair  of  the 
aneurysm with insertion of a prosthetic graft or endovascular place-
ment of an aortic stent graft (Fig. 274-3) is indicated for abdominal 
aortic aneurysms of any size that are expanding rapidly or are asso-
ciated  with  symptoms.  For  asymptomatic  aneurysms,  abdominal 
aortic aneurysm repair is indicated if the diameter is ≥5.5 cm. In 
randomized  trials  of  patients  with  abdominal  aortic  aneurysms 
<5.5 cm, there was no difference in the long-term (>8-year) mor-
tality rate between those followed with ultrasound surveillance and 
those  undergoing  elective  endovascular  or  surgical  repair.  Thus, 
serial noninvasive follow-up of smaller aneurysms (<5.5 cm) is an 
alternative to immediate repair. The decision to perform an open 
surgical  operation  or  endovascular  repair  is  based  in  part  on  the 
vascular  anatomy  and  comorbid  conditions.  Endovascular  repair 
of  abdominal  aortic  aneurysms  has  a  lower  short-term  morbidity 
rate, but a comparable long-term mortality rate with open surgical 
reconstruction.  Long-term  surveillance  with  CT  or  MR  aortogra-
phy is indicated after endovascular repair to detect leaks and possi-
ble aneurysm expansion.

In surgical candidates, careful preoperative cardiac and general 
medical  evaluations  (followed  by  appropriate  therapy  for  compli-
cating conditions) are essential. Preexisting coronary artery disease, 
congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and 
advanced age add to the risk of surgery. With careful preoperative 
cardiac evaluation and postoperative care, the operative mortality 
rate  approximates  1–2%.  After  acute  rupture,  the  mortality  rate 
of  emergent  operation  is  45–50%.  Endovascular  repair  with  stent 
placement is an alternative approach to treat ruptured aneurysms 
and may be associated with a lower mortality rate.

ACUTE AORTIC SYNDROMES
The four major acute aortic syndromes are aortic rupture (discussed 
earlier),  aortic  dissection,  intramural  hematoma,  and  penetrating 
atherosclerotic ulcer. Aortic dissection is caused by a circumferential 
or, less frequently, transverse tear of the intima. It often occurs along 
the right lateral wall of the ascending aorta where the hydraulic shear 
stress is high. Another common site is the descending thoracic aorta 
just  below  the  ligamentum  arteriosum.  The  initiating  event  is  either 
a  primary  intimal  tear  with  secondary  dissection  into  the  media  or 
a  medial  hemorrhage  that  dissects  into  and  disrupts  the  intima.  The 
pulsatile  aortic  flow  then  dissects  along  the  elastic  lamellar  plates  of 
the aorta and creates a false lumen. The dissection usually propagates 
distally  down  the  descending  aorta  and  into  its  major  branches,  but 
it  may  propagate  proximally.  Distal  propagation  may  be  limited  by 
atherosclerotic  plaque.  In  some  cases,  a  secondary  distal  intimal  dis-
ruption occurs, resulting in the reentry of blood from the false to the 
true lumen.

There are at least two important pathologic and radiologic variants 
of  aortic  dissection:  intramural  hematoma  without  an  intimal  flap 
and  penetrating  atherosclerotic  ulcer.  Acute  intramural  hematoma  is 
thought to result from rupture of the vasa vasorum with hemorrhage 
into  the  wall  of  the  aorta.  Most  of  these  hematomas  occur  in  the 
descending thoracic aorta. Acute intramural hematomas may progress 
to dissection and rupture. Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers are caused 
by erosion of a plaque into the aortic media, are usually localized, and 
are not associated with extensive propagation. They are found primar-
ily in the middle and distal portions of the descending thoracic aorta 
and are associated with extensive atherosclerotic disease. The ulcer can

Type B

FIGURE  280-4  Classification  of  aortic  dissections.  Stanford  classification:  Type  A 
dissections (top) involve the ascending aorta independent of site of tear and distal 
extension;  type  B  dissections  (bottom)  involve  transverse  and/or  descending 
aorta without involvement of the ascending aorta. DeBakey classification: Type I 
dissection involves ascending to descending aorta (top left); type II dissection is 
limited to ascending or transverse aorta, without descending aorta (top center + top 
right); type III dissection involves descending aorta only (bottom left). (Reproduced

erode beyond the internal elastic lamina, leading to medial hematoma, 
and may progress to false aneurysm formation or rupture.

Several  classification  schemes  have  been  developed  for  thoracic 
aortic  dissections.  DeBakey  and  colleagues  initially  classified  aortic 
dissections as type I, in which an intimal tear occurs in the ascending 
aorta but the dissection may propagate to the aortic arch, the descend-
ing thoracic aorta, and even the abdominal aorta; type II, in which the 
dissection is limited to the ascending aorta; and type III, in which the 
intimal tear is located in the descending aorta with distal propagation 
of the dissection (Fig. 280-4). Another classification (Stanford) is that 
of type A, in which the dissection involves the ascending aorta (prox-
imal dissection), and type B, in which it is limited to the arch and/or 
descending aorta (distal dissection). From a management standpoint, 
classification of aortic dissections and intramural hematomas into type 
A or B is more practical and useful, since DeBakey types I and II are 
managed in a similar manner.

The factors that predispose to aortic dissection include those asso-
ciated  with  medial  degeneration  and  others  that  increase  aortic  wall 
stress (Table 280-1). Systemic hypertension is a coexisting condition in 
70% of patients. Aortic dissection is the major cause of morbidity and 
mortality  in  patients  with  Marfan’s  syndrome  (Chap.  413)  or  Loeys- 
Dietz syndrome, and similarly may affect patients with Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome. The incidence also is increased in patients with inflamma-
tory  aortitis  (i.e.,  Takayasu’s  arteritis,  giant  cell  arteritis),  congenital 
aortic valve anomalies (e.g., bicuspid valve), coarctation of the aorta, 
and  a  history  of  aortic  trauma.  In  addition,  the  risk  of  dissection  is 
increased  in  otherwise  normal  women  during  the  third  trimester 
of  pregnancy.  Aortic  dissection  also  may  occur  as  a  consequence  of 
weight lifting, cocaine use, or deceleration injury.
 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The  peak  incidence  of  aortic  dissection  is  in  the  sixth  and  seventh 
decades.  Men  are  more  affected  than  women  by  a  ratio  of  2:1.  The 
presentations of aortic dissection and its variants are the consequences

of  intimal  tear,  dissecting  hematoma,  occlusion  of  involved  arteries, 
and compression of adjacent tissues. Acute aortic dissection presents 
with the sudden onset of pain (Chap. 14), which often is described as 
very  severe  and  tearing  and  is  associated  with  diaphoresis.  The  pain 
may be localized to the front or back of the chest, often the interscap-
ular region, and typically migrates with propagation of the dissection. 
Other  symptoms  include  syncope,  dyspnea,  and  weakness.  Physical 
findings may include hypertension or hypotension, loss of pulses, aor-
tic  regurgitation,  pulmonary  edema,  and  neurologic  findings  due  to 
carotid artery obstruction (hemiplegia, hemianesthesia) or spinal cord 
ischemia  (paraplegia).  Bowel  ischemia,  hematuria,  and  myocardial 
ischemia all may occur. These clinical manifestations reflect complica-
tions resulting from the dissection occluding the major arteries. Fur-
thermore, clinical manifestations may result from the compression of 
adjacent structures (e.g., superior cervical ganglia, superior vena cava, 
bronchus, esophagus) by the expanding dissection causing aneurysmal 
dilation and include Horner’s syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, 
hoarseness,  dysphagia,  and  airway  compromise.  Hemopericardium 
and cardiac tamponade may complicate a type A lesion with retrograde 
dissection.  Acute  aortic  regurgitation  is  an  important  and  common 
(>50%) complication of proximal dissection. It is the outcome of either 
a circumferential tear that widens the aortic root or a disruption of the 
annulus  by  a  dissecting  hematoma  that  tears  a  leaflet(s)  or  displaces 
it, inferior to the line of closure. Signs of aortic regurgitation include 
bounding  pulses,  a  wide  pulse  pressure,  a  diastolic  murmur  often 
radiating  along  the  right  sternal  border,  and  evidence  of  congestive 
heart failure. The clinical manifestations depend on the severity of the 
regurgitation.

In  dissections  involving  the  ascending  aorta,  the  chest  x-ray  often 
reveals  a  widened  superior  mediastinum.  A  pleural  effusion  (usually 
left-sided) also may be present. This effusion is typically serosanguin-
eous and not indicative of rupture unless accompanied by hypotension 
and falling hematocrit. In dissections of the descending thoracic aorta, 
a widened mediastinum may be observed on chest x-ray. In addition, 
the  descending  aorta  may  appear  to  be  wider  than  the  ascending 
portion. An electrocardiogram that shows no evidence of myocardial 
ischemia is helpful in distinguishing aortic dissection from myocardial 
infarction among patients who present with chest pain. Rarely, the dis-
section involves the right or, less commonly, left coronary ostium and 
causes acute myocardial infarction.

The diagnosis of aortic dissection can be established by noninvasive 
techniques  such  as  echocardiography,  CT,  and  MRI.  Aortography  is 
used less commonly because of the accuracy of these noninvasive tech-
niques. Transthoracic echocardiography can be performed simply and 
rapidly and has an overall sensitivity of 60–85% for aortic dissection. 
For  diagnosing  proximal  ascending  aortic  dissections,  its  sensitivity 
exceeds 80%; it is less useful for detecting dissection of the arch and 
descending thoracic aorta. Transesophageal echocardiography requires 
greater skill and patient cooperation but is very accurate in identifying 
dissections of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta but not the 
arch,  achieving  98%  sensitivity  and  ~90%  specificity.  Echocardiogra-
phy also provides important information regarding the presence and 
severity of aortic regurgitation and pericardial effusion. CT and MRI 
are both highly accurate in identifying the intimal flap and the extent 
of the dissection and involvement of major arteries; each has a sensi-
tivity and specificity >90%. They are useful in recognizing intramural 
hemorrhage and penetrating ulcers. The relative utility of transesoph-
ageal echocardiography, CT, and MRI depends on the availability and 
expertise  in  individual  institutions  as  well  as  on  the  hemodynamic 
stability  of  the  patient,  with  CT  and  MRI  obviously  less  suitable  for 
unstable patients.

TREATMENT
Aortic Dissection

Medical therapy should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is con-
sidered. The patient should be admitted to an intensive care unit for 
hemodynamic monitoring. Unless hypotension is present, therapy

should  be  aimed  at  reducing  cardiac  contractility  and  systemic 
arterial pressure, and thus shear stress. For acute dissection, unless 
contraindicated,  β-adrenergic  blockers  should  be  administered 
parenterally,  using  intravenous  propranolol,  metoprolol,  or  the 
short-acting esmolol to achieve a heart rate of ~60 beats/min. This 
should be accompanied by sodium nitroprusside infusion to lower 
systolic  blood  pressure  to  ≤120  mmHg.  Labetalol  (Chap.  277),  a 
drug with both β- and α-adrenergic blocking properties, also may 
be used as a parenteral agent in acute therapy for dissection.

The calcium channel antagonists verapamil and diltiazem may be 
used intravenously if nitroprusside or β-adrenergic blockers cannot 
be  employed.  The  addition  of  a  parenteral  angiotensin-converting 
enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitor  such  as  enalaprilat  to  a  β-adrenergic 
blocker also may be considered. Isolated use of a direct vasodilator 
such  as  hydralazine  is  contraindicated  because  these  agents  can 
increase hydraulic shear and may propagate the dissection.

Emergent or urgent surgical correction is the preferred treatment 
for  acute  ascending  aortic  dissections  and  intramural  hematomas 
(type A). Surgery involves excision of the intimal flap, obliteration 
of the false lumen, and placement of an interposition graft. Aortic 
valve repair or a composite valve-graft conduit is used if the aor-
tic  valve  is  disrupted.  The  overall  in-hospital  mortality  rate  after 
surgical  treatment  of  patients  with  aortic  dissection  is  reported 
to  be  15–25%.  The  major  causes  of  perioperative  mortality  and 
morbidity  include  myocardial  infarction,  paraplegia,  renal  failure, 
tamponade, hemorrhage, and sepsis. Thoracic endovascular aortic 
repair with an endoluminal stent graft is indicated for complicated 
type  B  dissections,  including  those  characterized  by  propagation, 
compromise of major aortic branches, impending rupture, or con-
tinued pain. Other transcatheter techniques, such as fenestration of 
the intimal flaps and stenting of narrowed branch vessels to increase 
flow to compromised organs, are used in selected patients. Surgical 
correction is indicated for complicated type B dissections, particu-
larly if endovascular repair is not feasible. Hybrid procedures con-
sisting of both surgery and endovascular repair may be used when 
the  dissection  involves  both  the  aortic  arch  and  the  descending 
thoracic aorta. For uncomplicated and stable distal dissections and 
intramural  hematomas  (type  B),  medical  therapy  is  the  preferred 
treatment. The in-hospital mortality rate of medically treated patients 
with type B dissection is ~12%. Long-term therapy for patients with 
aortic dissection and intramural hematomas (with or without surgery) 
consists of control of hypertension and reduction of cardiac contrac-
tility  with  the  use  of  β-adrenergic  blockers  plus  other  antihyperten-
sive  agents,  such  as  ACE  inhibitors  or  calcium  antagonists.  Patients 
with chronic type B dissection and intramural hematomas should be 
followed  on  an  outpatient  basis  every  6–12  months  with  contrast- 
enhanced CT or MRI to detect propagation or expansion. Patients with 
Marfan’s  syndrome  are  at  high  risk  for  postdissection  complications. 
The long-term  prognosis  following  hospital  discharge  for  patients 
with  treated  dissections  is  generally  good  with  careful  follow-up; 
the 10-year survival rate is ~60%.

 ■ CHRONIC ATHEROSCLEROTIC  
OCCLUSIVE DISEASE
Atherosclerosis may affect the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Occlusive 
aortic disease caused by atherosclerosis usually is confined to the distal 
abdominal aorta below the renal arteries. Frequently the disease extends 
to the iliac arteries (Chap. 281). Claudication characteristically involves 
the buttocks, thighs, and calves and may be associated with impotence 
in males (Leriche’s syndrome). The severity of the symptoms depends 
on  the  adequacy  of  collaterals.  With  sufficient  collateral  blood  flow, 
a  complete  occlusion  of  the  abdominal  aorta  may  occur  without  the 
development of ischemic symptoms. The physical findings include the 
absence of femoral and other distal pulses bilaterally and the detection 
of an audible bruit over the abdomen (usually at or below the umbili-
cus) and the common femoral arteries. Atrophic skin, loss of hair, and 
coolness  of  the  lower  extremities  usually  are  observed.  In  advanced 
ischemia, rubor on dependency and pallor on elevation can be seen.

The  diagnosis  usually  is  established  by  physical  examination  and 
noninvasive  testing,  including  leg  pressure  measurements,  Doppler 
velocity  analysis,  pulse  volume  recordings,  and  duplex  ultrasonog-
raphy.  The  anatomy  may  be  defined  by  MR,  CT,  or  conventional 
contrast  angiography,  typically  performed  when  one  is  considering 
revascularization. Catheter-based endovascular or operative treatment 
is indicated in patients with lifestyle-limiting or debilitating symptoms 
of claudication and patients with critical limb ischemia.

 ■ ACUTE AORTIC OCCLUSION
Acute  occlusion  in  the  distal  abdominal  aorta  constitutes  a  medical 
emergency because it threatens the viability of the lower extremities; it 
usually results from an occlusive (saddle) embolus that almost always 
originates  from  the  heart.  Rarely,  acute  occlusion  may  occur  as  the 
result of in situ thrombosis in a preexisting severely narrowed segment 
of the aorta.

The clinical picture is one of acute ischemia of the lower extremi-
ties. Severe rest pain, coolness, and pallor of the lower extremities and 
the  absence  of  distal  pulses  bilaterally  are  the  usual  manifestations. 
Diagnosis should be established rapidly by MRI, CT, or aortography. 
Emergency thrombectomy or revascularization is indicated.

AORTITIS
Aortitis,  a  term  referring  to  inflammatory  disease  of  the  aorta,  may 
be caused by large vessel vasculitides such as Takayasu’s arteritis and 
giant  cell  arteritis,  rheumatic  and  HLA-B27–associated  spondyloar-
thropathies,  Behçet’s  syndrome,  antineutrophil  cytoplasmic  antibody 
(ANCA)–associated vasculitides, Cogan’s syndrome, Erdheim-Chester 
disease, IgG4-related systemic disease, and infections such as syphilis, 
tuberculosis,  and  Salmonella,  or  it  may  be  associated  with  retroperi-
toneal  fibrosis.  Aortitis  may  result  in  aneurysmal  dilation  and  aortic 
regurgitation,  occlusion  of  the  aorta  and  its  branch  vessels,  or  acute 
aortic syndromes.

 ■ TAKAYASU’S ARTERITIS
(See  also  Chap.  363)  This  inflammatory  disease  often  affects  the 
ascending aorta and aortic arch, causing obstruction of the aorta and 
its  major  arteries.  Takayasu’s  arteritis  is  also  termed  pulseless  disease 
because of the frequent occlusion of the large arteries originating from 
the aorta. It also may involve the descending thoracic and abdominal 
aorta  and  occlude  large  branches  such  as  the  renal  arteries.  Aortic 
aneurysms also may occur. The pathology is a panarteritis character-
ized  by  mononuclear  cells  and  occasionally  giant  cells,  with  marked 
intimal  hyperplasia,  medial  and  adventitial  thickening,  and,  in  the 
chronic  form,  fibrotic  occlusion.  The  disease  is  most  prevalent  in 
young  females  of  Asian  descent  but  does  occur  in  women  of  other 
geographic and ethnic origins and also in young men. During the acute 
stage, fever, malaise, weight loss, and other systemic symptoms may be 
evident. Elevations of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive 
protein are common. The chronic stages of the disease, which is inter-
mittently active, present with symptoms related to large artery occlu-
sion, such as upper extremity claudication, cerebral ischemia, and 
syncope. The process is progressive, and there is no definitive therapy. 
Glucocorticoids are effective in most patients during the acute phase. 
Other immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, 
leflunomide,  or  mycophenolate,  are  prescribed  to  some  patients  to 
lower glucocorticoid requirements and treat relapses. Biologically tar-
geted agents are also used, but efficacy has not been established in ran-
domized clinical trials. Surgical bypass or endovascular intervention of 
a critically stenotic artery may be necessary.

 ■ GIANT CELL ARTERITIS
(See  also  Chap.  363)  This  vasculitis  occurs  in  older  individuals  and 
affects  women  more  often  than  men.  Primarily  large  and  medium-
size arteries are affected. The pathology is that of focal granulomatous 
lesions involving the entire arterial wall; it frequently is associated with 
polymyalgia  rheumatica.  Obstruction  of  medium-size  arteries  (e.g., 
temporal  and  ophthalmic  arteries)  and  major  branches  of  the  aorta

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemand the development of aortitis and aortic regurgitation are important 
complications of the disease. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy should 
be administered early and then gradually tapered. Immunosuppressive 
therapy with methotrexate may allow reduction in steroid dosage and 
reduce  the  risk  of  relapse.  Tocilizumab,  an  interleukin-6  antagonist, 
demonstrated efficacy in several randomized trials. Other biologically 
targeted therapies are under investigation.

 ■ RHEUMATIC AORTITIS
Rheumatoid arthritis (Chap. 358), ankylosing spondylitis (Chap. 362), 
psoriatic  arthritis  (Chap.  362),  reactive  arthritis  (formerly  known  as 
Reiter’s syndrome) (Chap. 362), relapsing polychondritis, and inflam-
matory  bowel  disorders  may  all  be  associated  with  aortitis  involving 
the  ascending  aorta.  The  inflammatory  lesions  usually  involve  the 
ascending aorta and may extend to the sinuses of Valsalva, the mitral 
valve  leaflets,  and  adjacent  myocardium.  The  clinical  manifestations 
are  aneurysm,  aortic  regurgitation,  and  involvement  of  the  cardiac 
conduction system.

 ■ IDIOPATHIC AORTITIS
Idiopathic  abdominal  aortitis  is  characterized  by  adventitial  and 
periaortic inflammation with thickening of the aortic wall. It is associ-
ated with abdominal aortic aneurysms and idiopathic retroperitoneal 
fibrosis.  Affected  individuals  may  present  with  vague  constitutional 
symptoms,  fever,  and  abdominal  pain.  Retroperitoneal  fibrosis  can 
cause  ureteral  obstruction  and  hydronephrosis.  Glucocorticoids  and 
immunosuppressive agents may reduce the inflammation.

 ■ INFECTIVE AORTITIS
Infective aortitis may result from direct invasion of the aortic wall by 
bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Salmo-
nella or by fungi. These bacteria cause aortitis by infecting the aorta at 
sites of atherosclerotic plaque. Bacterial proteases lead to degradation 
of collagen, and the ensuing destruction of the aortic wall leads to the 
formation of a saccular aneurysm referred to as a mycotic aneurysm. 
Mycotic aneurysms have a predilection for the suprarenal abdominal 
aorta.  The  pathologic  characteristics  of  the  aortic  wall  include  acute 
and  chronic  inflammation,  abscesses,  hemorrhage,  and  necrosis. 
Mycotic aneurysms typically affect the elderly and occur in men three 
times more frequently than in women. Patients may present with fever, 
sepsis, and chest, back, or abdominal pain; there may have been a pre-
ceding diarrheal illness. Blood cultures are positive in the majority of 
patients. Both CT and MRI are useful to diagnose mycotic aneurysms. 
Treatment  includes  antibiotic  therapy  and  surgical  removal  of  the 
affected part of the aorta and revascularization of the lower extremities 
with grafts placed in uninfected tissue.

Syphilitic aortitis is a late manifestation of luetic infection (Chap. 182) 
that usually affects the proximal ascending aorta, particularly the aortic 
root,  resulting  in  aortic  dilation  and  aneurysm  formation.  Syphilitic 
aortitis  occasionally  may  involve  the  aortic  arch  or  the  descending 
aorta.  The  aneurysms  may  be  saccular  or  fusiform  and  are  usually 
asymptomatic, but compression of and erosion into adjacent structures 
may result in symptoms; rupture also may occur.

The initial lesion is an obliterative endarteritis of the vasa vasorum, 
especially  in  the  adventitia.  This  is  an  inflammatory  response  to  the 
invasion of the adventitia by the spirochetes. Destruction of the aortic 
media occurs as the spirochetes spread into this layer, usually via the 
lymphatics  accompanying  the  vasa  vasorum.  Destruction  of  collagen 
and  elastic  tissues  leads  to  dilation  of  the  aorta,  scar  formation,  and 
calcification. These changes account for the characteristic radiographic 
appearance of linear calcification of the ascending aorta.

The  disease  typically  presents  as  an  incidental  chest  radiographic 
finding 15–30 years after initial infection. Symptoms may result from 
aortic regurgitation, narrowing of coronary ostia due to syphilitic aor-
titis, compression of adjacent structures (e.g., esophagus), or rupture. 
Diagnosis is established by a positive serologic test, i.e., rapid plasmin 
reagin (RPR) or fluorescent treponemal antibody. Treatment includes 
penicillin and surgical excision and repair.

the Extremities

 ■ PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE
Peripheral  artery  disease  (PAD)  is  defined  as  a  clinical  disorder  in 
which there is a stenosis or occlusion in the aorta or the arteries of the 
limbs. Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of PAD in patients >40 years 
old. Other causes include thrombosis, embolism, vasculitis, fibromus-
cular dysplasia, entrapment, cystic adventitial disease, and trauma. The 
highest prevalence of atherosclerotic PAD occurs in the sixth and sev-
enth decades of life. As in patients with atherosclerosis of the coronary 
and cerebral vasculature, there is an increased risk of developing PAD 
in cigarette smokers and in persons with diabetes mellitus, hypercho-
lesterolemia, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

Pathology  Segmental  lesions  that  cause  stenosis  or  occlusion  are 
usually  localized  to  large  and  medium-size  vessels.  The  pathology  of 
the  lesions  includes  atherosclerotic  plaques  with  calcium  deposition, 
thinning of the media, patchy destruction of muscle and elastic fibers, 
fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, and thrombi composed of 
platelets and fibrin. The primary sites of involvement are the abdomi-
nal aorta and iliac arteries (30% of symptomatic patients), the femoral 
and popliteal arteries (80–90% of patients), and the more distal vessels, 
including the tibial and peroneal arteries (40–50% of patients). Athero-
sclerotic lesions occur preferentially at arterial branch points, which are 
sites  of  increased  turbulence,  altered  shear  stress,  and  intimal  injury.

2108 Involvement of the distal vasculature is most common in elderly indi-

viduals and patients with diabetes mellitus.

Clinical  Evaluation  Fewer  than  50%  of  patients  with  PAD  are 
symptomatic, although many have a slow or impaired gait. The most 
typical  symptom  is  intermittent  claudication,  which  is  defined  as  a 
pain,  ache,  cramp,  numbness,  or  a  sense  of  fatigue  in  the  muscles;  it 
occurs during exercise and is relieved by rest. The site of claudication is 
distal to the location of the occlusive lesion. For example, buttock, hip, 
thigh,  and  calf  discomfort  occurs  in  patients  with  aortoiliac  disease, 
whereas  calf  claudication  develops  in  patients  with  femoral-popliteal 
disease. Symptoms are far more common in the lower than in the upper 
extremities  because  of  the  higher  incidence  of  obstructive  lesions  in 
the former region. In patients with severe arterial occlusive disease in 
whom resting blood flow cannot accommodate basal nutritional needs 
of  the  tissues,  critical  limb  ischemia  may  develop.  Patients  complain 
of rest pain or a feeling of cold or numbness in the foot and toes. Fre-
quently,  these  symptoms  occur  at  night  when  the  legs  are  horizontal 
and improve when the legs are in a dependent position. With severe 
ischemia, rest pain may be persistent.

Important  physical  findings  of  PAD  include  decreased  or  absent 
pulses  distal  to  the  obstruction,  the  presence  of  bruits  over  the  nar-
rowed artery, and muscle atrophy. With more severe disease, hair loss, 
thickened nails, smooth and shiny skin, reduced skin temperature, and 
pallor or cyanosis are common physical signs. In patients with critical 
limb ischemia, ulcers or gangrene may occur. Elevation of the legs and 
repeated flexing of the calf muscles produce pallor of the soles of the 
feet,  whereas  rubor,  secondary  to  reactive  hyperemia,  may  develop 
when the legs are dependent. The time required for rubor to develop 
or for the veins in the foot to fill when the patient’s legs are transferred 
from an elevated to a dependent position is related to the severity of 
the ischemia and the presence of collateral vessels. Patients with severe 
ischemia may develop peripheral edema because they keep their legs in 
a dependent position much of the time. Ischemic neuropathy can result 
in numbness and hyporeflexia.
Noninvasive  Testing  The  history  and  physical  examination  are 
often sufficient to establish the diagnosis of PAD. An objective assess-
ment of the presence and severity of disease is obtained by noninvasive 
techniques. Arterial pressure can be recorded noninvasively in the legs 
by placement of sphygmomanometric cuffs at the ankles and the use of 
a Doppler device to auscultate or record blood flow from the dorsalis 

pedis  and  posterior  tibial  arteries.  Normally,  systolic  blood  pressure 
in the legs and arms is similar. Indeed, ankle pressure may be slightly 
higher than arm pressure due to pulse-wave amplification. In the pres-
ence of hemodynamically significant stenoses, the systolic blood pres-
sure in the leg is decreased. Thus, the ratio of the ankle and brachial 
artery pressures (termed the ankle-brachial index, or ABI) is 1.00–1.40 
in normal individuals. ABI values of 0.91–0.99 are considered “border-
line,” and those <0.90 are abnormal and diagnostic of PAD. ABIs >1.40 
indicate noncompressible arteries secondary to vascular calcification.

Other noninvasive tests include segmental pressure measurements, 
segmental  pulse  volume  recordings,  duplex  ultrasonography  (which 
combines  B-mode  imaging  and  Doppler  flow  velocity  waveform 
analysis), transcutaneous oximetry, and stress testing (usually using a 
treadmill). Placement of pneumatic cuffs enables assessment of systolic 
pressure  along  the  legs.  The  presence  of  pressure  gradients  between 
sequential  cuffs  provides  evidence  of  the  presence  and  location  of 
hemodynamically  significant  stenoses.  In  addition,  the  amplitude  of 
the pulse volume contour becomes blunted in the presence of signifi-
cant PAD. Duplex ultrasonography is used to image and detect stenotic 
lesions in native arteries and bypass grafts.

Treadmill  testing  allows  the  physician  to  assess  functional  lim-
itations  objectively.  Decline  of  the  ABI  immediately  after  exercise 
provides  further  support  for  the  diagnosis  of  PAD  in  patients  with 
equivocal symptoms and findings on examination.

Magnetic  resonance  angiography  (MRA),  computed  tomographic 
angiography  (CTA),  and  conventional  catheter-based  angiography 
should  not  be  used  for  routine  diagnostic  testing,  but  are  performed 
before  potential  revascularization  (Fig.  281-1).  Each  test  is  useful  in 
defining the anatomy to assist planning for endovascular and surgical 
revascularization procedures.

Prognosis  The natural history of patients with PAD is influenced 
primarily by the extent of coexisting coronary artery and cerebrovascu-
lar disease. Approximately one-third to one-half of patients with symp-
tomatic  PAD  have  evidence  of  coronary  artery  disease  (CAD)  based 
on clinical presentation and electrocardiogram, and over one-half have 
significant  CAD  by  coronary  angiography.  Patients  with  PAD  have  a 
15–25% 5-year mortality rate and a two- to fourfold increased risk of 
death from cardiovascular disease. Measurement of ABI is useful for 
detecting PAD and identifying persons at risk for adverse cardiovascu-
lar and limb events. Mortality rates are highest in those with the most

severe PAD. The ABI worsens in almost 40% of patients, and symptoms 
progress in ~20–25% when assessed over a period of 5 years. Approxi-
mately 11% of patients with symptomatic PAD ultimately develop crit-
ical limb ischemia, and 25–30% of patients with critical limb ischemia 
undergo amputation within 1 year. The prognosis is worse in patients 
who continue to smoke cigarettes or have diabetes mellitus.

TREATMENT
Peripheral Artery Disease

Patients  with  PAD  should  receive  therapies  to  reduce  the  risk  of 
associated  cardiovascular  events,  such  as  myocardial  infarction 
and  death,  and  to  improve  limb  symptoms,  prevent  progression 
to  critical  limb  ischemia,  and  preserve  limb  viability.  Risk  factor 
modification  and  antithrombotic  therapy  should  be  initiated  to 
improve  cardiovascular  outcomes.  The  importance  of  discontin-
uing  cigarette  smoking  cannot  be  overemphasized.  The  physician 
must assume a major role in this lifestyle modification. Counseling 
and adjunctive drug therapy with the nicotine patch, bupropion, or 
varenicline increase smoking cessation rates and reduce recidivism. 
It is important to control blood pressure in hypertensive patients. 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin recep-
tor blockers may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients 
with  symptomatic  PAD.  β-Adrenergic  blockers  do  not  worsen 
claudication  and  may  be  used  to  treat  hypertension,  especially  in 
patients  with  coexistent  CAD.  Treatment  of  hypercholesterolemia 
with  statins  and,  if  needed,  adjunctive  lipid-lowering  agents  such 
as ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor, is advocated to reduce the risk 
of  myocardial  infarction,  stroke,  and  death.  The  2018  American 
Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) 
Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol recommends 
high-intensity statin treatment in patients with atherosclerotic dis-
orders, including PAD, with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater 
reduction  in  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol.  Platelet  inhib-
itors,  including  aspirin  and  the  adenosine  diphosphate  (ADP) 
antagonist  clopidogrel,  reduce  the  risk  of  adverse  cardiovascular 
events  in  patients  with  atherosclerosis  and  are  recommended  for 
patients with symptomatic PAD, including those with intermittent 
claudication  or  critical  limb  ischemia  or  prior  lower  extremity 
revascularization.  Outcomes  with  ticagrelor  are  similar  to  those 
with clopidogrel. The benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy with both 
aspirin  and  clopidogrel  compared  with  aspirin  alone  in  reducing 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in patients with PAD 
is uncertain. When added to other antiplatelet therapy, vorapaxar, 
a  protease  activated  receptor-1  antagonist  that  inhibits  thrombin-
mediated  platelet  activation,  decreases  the  risk  of  adverse  cardio-
vascular  events  in  patients  with  atherosclerosis,  including  PAD. 
It  also  reduces  the  risk  of  acute  limb  ischemia  and  peripheral 
revascularization;  however,  it  is  associated  with  an  increased  rate 
of  moderate  bleeding.  The  anticoagulant  warfarin  is  as  effective 
as antiplatelet therapy in preventing adverse cardiovascular events 
but  causes  more  major  bleeding;  therefore,  it  is  not  indicated  to 
improve outcomes in patients with chronic PAD. The combination 
of a low dose of the oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban and aspi-
rin  improves  cardiovascular  and  limb  outcomes  in  patients  with 
established  atherosclerosis,  including  PAD,  including  those  who 
have undergone peripheral revascularization, but is associated with 
increased risk of bleeding.

Therapies  for  intermittent  claudication  and  critical  limb  ische-
mia  include  supportive  measures,  medications,  exercise  training, 
endovascular  interventions,  and  surgery.  Supportive  measures 
include  meticulous  care  of  the  feet,  which  should  be  kept  clean 
and  protected  against  excessive  drying  with  moisturizing  creams. 
Well-fitting  and  protective  shoes  are  advised  to  reduce  trauma. 
Elastic  support  hose  should  be  avoided,  as  it  reduces  blood  flow 
to  the  skin.  In  patients  with  critical  limb  ischemia,  shock  blocks 
under the head of the bed together with a canopy over the feet may 
improve perfusion pressure and ameliorate some of the rest pain.

Patients  with  claudication  should  be  encouraged  to  exercise 
regularly  and  at  progressively  more  strenuous  levels.  Supervised 
exercise training programs for 30- to 45-min sessions, at least three 
per  week  for  12  weeks,  prolong  walking  distance.  The  beneficial 
effect  of  supervised  exercise  training  on  walking  performance  in 
patients  with  claudication  often  is  similar  to  or  greater  than  that 
realized after a revascularization procedure. Structured home and 
community-based exercise programs are also effective. Pharmaco-
logic treatment of PAD has not been as successful as the medical 
treatment  of  CAD  (Chap.  273).  In  particular,  vasodilators  as  a 
class have not proved to be beneficial. During exercise, peripheral 
vasodilation occurs distal to sites of significant arterial stenoses. As 
a  result,  perfusion  pressure  falls,  often  to  levels  lower  than  those 
generated in the interstitial tissue by the exercising muscle. Drugs 
such as α-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel antagonists, 
and  other  vasodilators  have  not  been  shown  to  be  effective  in 
patients with PAD.

Cilostazol,  a  phosphodiesterase  inhibitor  with  vasodilator  and 
antiplatelet  properties,  increases  claudication  distance  by  40–60% 
and improves measures of quality of life. The mechanism of action 
accounting for its beneficial effects is not known. Pentoxifylline, a 
substituted xanthine derivative, increases blood flow to the micro-
circulation  and  enhances  tissue  oxygenation.  Although  several 
placebo-controlled studies have found that pentoxifylline modestly 
increases  the  duration  of  exercise,  its  efficacy  has  not  been  con-
firmed  in  other  clinical  trials.  Statins  appeared  effective  for  treat-
ment of intermittent claudication in initial clinical trials, but more 
studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of this class of drugs.

There is no definitive medical therapy for critical limb ischemia. 
Vasodilator  prostaglandins  are  not  effective  in  relieving  symp-
toms or preventing limb loss. Enthusiasm for therapy with angio-
genic  growth  factors  abated  when  clinical  trials  of  intramuscular 
gene transfer of DNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor, 
fibroblast  growth  factor,  hepatocyte  growth  factor,  or  hypoxia- 
inducible  factor  1α  failed  to  demonstrate  improvement  in  symp-
toms  or  outcomes  in  patients  with  intermittent  claudication  or 
critical limb ischemia. Most clinical trials of bone marrow–derived 
vascular  progenitor  cells  to  promote  angiogenesis  and  preserve 
limb viability in patients with critical limb ischemia have failed to 
demonstrate  benefit,  although  a  meta-analysis  of  these  trials  sug-
gested a modest reduction in the risk of amputation. 

REVASCULARIZATION
Revascularization  procedures,  including  catheter-based  and  sur-
gical  interventions,  are  usually  indicated  for  patients  with  dis-
abling, progressive, or severe symptoms of intermittent claudication 
despite medical therapy in order to improve walking distance and 
functional capacity. These are also indicated in patients with critical 
limb ischemia to relieve pain and prevent limb loss. MRA, CTA, or 
conventional angiography should be performed to assess vascular 
anatomy  in  patients  who  are  being  considered  for  revasculariza-
tion. Endovascular interventions include percutaneous translumi-
nal  balloon  angioplasty  (PTA)  (including  drug-coated  balloons), 
stent  placement  (including  drug-eluting  stents),  stent  grafts,  and 
atherectomy (Chap. 276). When endovascular intervention is per-
formed in conjunction with a supervised exercise program, walking 
distance improves more than with exercise training alone.

PTA  and  stenting  of  the  iliac  artery  are  associated  with  higher 
success  rates  than  are  PTA  and  stenting  of  the  femoral  and  pop-
liteal  arteries.  Approximately  90–95%  of  iliac  PTAs  are  initially 
successful, and the 3-year patency rate is >75%. Patency rates may 
be higher if a stent is placed in the iliac artery. The initial success 
rate for femoral-popliteal PTA and stenting approximate 90% with 
60%  3-year  patency  rates.  Several  clinical  trials  have  found  lower 
femoral-popliteal  restenosis  rates  with  drug-coated  balloons  than 
with PTA, and with drug-eluting stents compared with bare metal 
stents. Recent meta-analyses have raised concerns about increased 
mortality  in  patients  treated  with  paclitaxel  drug-coated  balloons 
and  drug-eluting  stents,  but  conclusive  evidence  of  this  adverse

outcome from prospective randomized trials is lacking. Endovascu-
lar interventions of the infrapopliteal, tibial, and peroneal arteries, 
often in conjunction with treatment of more proximal lesions, can 
be undertaken to treat critical limb ischemia and prevent limb loss.
Several  operative  procedures  are  available  for  treating  patients 
with  PAD.  The  preferred  operative  procedure  depends  on  the 
location and extent of the obstruction(s) and the general medical 
condition  of  the  patient.  Operative  procedures  for  aortoiliac  dis-
ease include aortobifemoral bypass, axillofemoral bypass, femoro- 
femoral bypass, and aortoiliac endarterectomy. The most frequently 
used procedure is the aortobifemoral bypass using knitted Dacron 
grafts. Immediate graft patency approaches 99%, and 5- and 10-year 
graft  patency  rates  in  survivors  are  >90%  and  80%,  respectively. 
Operative complications include myocardial infarction and stroke, 
infection of the graft, peripheral embolization, and sexual dysfunc-
tion from interruption of autonomic nerves in the pelvis. The oper-
ative  mortality  rate  ranges  from  1  to  3%,  mostly  due  to  ischemic 
heart disease.

Operative therapy for femoral-popliteal and tibioperoneal artery 
disease  includes  in  situ  and  reverse  autogenous  saphenous  vein 
bypass grafts, placement of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or other 
synthetic grafts, and thromboendarterectomy. The operative mor-
tality rate ranges from 1 to 3%. The long-term patency rate depends 
on the type of graft used, the location of the distal anastomosis, and 
the patency of runoff vessels beyond the anastomosis. Patency rates 
of femoral-popliteal saphenous vein bypass grafts approach 90% at 
1 year and 70–80% at 5 years. Five-year patency rates of infrapop-
liteal saphenous vein bypass grafts are 60–70%. In contrast, 5-year 
patency rates of infrapopliteal PTFE grafts are <30%.

Preoperative  cardiac  risk  assessment  may  identify  individuals 
who  are  especially  likely  to  experience  an  adverse  cardiac  event 
during the perioperative period. Patients with angina, prior myo-
cardial  infarction,  heart  failure,  diabetes,  or  renal  insufficiency 
are  among  those  at  increased  risk.  Stress  testing  with  treadmill 
exercise  (if  feasible),  radionuclide  myocardial  perfusion  imaging, 
or echocardiography permits further stratification of risk in these 
patients,  particularly  those  with  poor  or  unknown  functional 
capacity  (Chap.  276).  Patients  with  abnormal  test  results  require 
close  supervision  and  adjunctive  management  with  anti-ischemic 
medications. Coronary angiography and coronary artery revascu-
larization compared with optimal medical therapy do not improve 
outcomes in most patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery, 
but  cardiac  catheterization  should  be  considered  in  patients  with 
unstable angina and angina refractory to medical therapy as well as 
those suspected of having left main or three-vessel CAD.

 ■ FIBROMUSCULAR DYSPLASIA
Fibromuscular dysplasia is a hyperplastic disorder that typically affects 
medium-size and small arteries, but it can also affect larger arteries. It 
occurs  predominantly  in  females  and  usually  involves  the  renal  and 
carotid/vertebral  arteries  but  can  involve  coronary  and  mesenteric 
arteries,  as  well  as  extremity  vessels  such  as  the  iliac  and  subclavian 
arteries. Fibromuscular dysplasia may cause stenosis, dissection, aneu-
rysm, or thrombosis in affected arteries.

The  histologic  classification  includes  intimal  fibroplasia,  medial 
dysplasia, and adventitial hyperplasia. Medial dysplasia is subdivided 
into medial fibroplasia, perimedial fibroplasia, and medial hyperplasia. 
Medial  fibroplasia  is  the  most  common  type  and  is  characterized  by 
alternating areas of thinned media and fibromuscular ridges. The inter-
nal elastic lamina usually is preserved. A contemporary classification 
based on the angiographic appearance divides fibromuscular dysplasia 
into  two  types:  multifocal  (analogous  to  medial  dysplasia)  and  focal 
(intimal fibroplasia).

The iliac arteries are the limb arteries most likely to be affected by 
fibromuscular  dysplasia.  It  is  identified  angiographically  by  a  “string 
of  beads”  multifocal  appearance  caused  by  thickened  fibromuscular 
ridges contiguous with thin, less-involved portions of the arterial wall, 
or  less  commonly,  as  a  focal  tubular  stenosis.  When  limb  vessels  are 

involved, clinical manifestations are similar to those for atherosclerosis, 
including claudication and rest pain. PTA and surgical reconstruction 
have been beneficial in patients with debilitating symptoms or threat-
ened limbs.

 ■ THROMBOANGIITIS OBLITERANS
Thromboangiitis  obliterans  (Buerger’s  disease)  is  an  inflammatory 
occlusive vascular disorder involving small and medium-size arteries 
and veins in the distal upper and lower extremities. Cerebral, visceral, 
and  coronary  vessels  may  be  affected  rarely.  This  disorder  develops 
most frequently in men <40 years of age. The prevalence is higher in 
Asians  and  individuals  of  Eastern  European  descent.  Although  the 
cause  of  thromboangiitis  obliterans  is  not  known,  there  is  a  definite 
relationship to cigarette smoking in patients with this disorder.

In  the  initial  stages  of  thromboangiitis  obliterans,  polymorphonu-
clear leukocytes infiltrate the walls of the small and medium-size arter-
ies and veins. The internal elastic lamina is preserved, and a cellular, 
inflammatory thrombus develops in the vascular lumen. As the disease 
progresses,  mononuclear  cells,  fibroblasts,  and  giant  cells  replace  the 
neutrophils.  Later  stages  are  characterized  by  perivascular  fibrosis, 
organized thrombus, and recanalization.

The  clinical  features  of  thromboangiitis  obliterans  often  include  a 
triad  of  claudication  of  the  affected  extremity,  Raynaud’s  phenome-
non,  and  migratory  superficial  vein  thrombophlebitis.  Claudication 
usually  is  confined  to  the  calves  and  feet  or  the  forearms  and  hands 
because this disorder primarily affects distal vessels. In the presence of 
severe digital ischemia, trophic nail changes, painful ulcerations, and 
gangrene may develop at the tips of the fingers or toes. The physical 
examination shows normal brachial and popliteal pulses but reduced 
or absent radial, ulnar, and/or tibial pulses. MRA, CTA, and conven-
tional  arteriography  are  helpful  in  making  the  diagnosis.  Smooth, 
tapering segmental lesions in the distal vessels are characteristic, as are 
collateral vessels at sites of vascular occlusion. Proximal atherosclerotic 
disease is usually absent. The diagnosis can be confirmed by excisional 
biopsy and pathologic examination of an involved vessel.

There is no specific treatment except abstention from tobacco. The 
prognosis is worse in individuals who continue to smoke, but results 
are discouraging even in those who stop smoking. Arterial bypass of 
the  larger  vessels  may  be  used  in  selected  instances,  as  well  as  local 
debridement,  depending  on  the  symptoms  and  severity  of  ischemia. 
Antibiotics may be useful; anticoagulants and glucocorticoids are not 
helpful. If these measures fail, amputation may be required.

 ■ VASCULITIS
Other  vasculitides  may  affect  the  arteries  that  supply  the  upper  and 
lower  extremities.  Takayasu’s  arteritis  and  giant  cell  (temporal) 
arteritis are discussed in Chap. 363.

 ■ ACUTE LIMB ISCHEMIA
Acute limb ischemia occurs when arterial occlusion results in the sud-
den cessation of blood flow to an extremity. The severity of ischemia 
and the viability of the extremity depend on the location and extent of 
the occlusion and the presence and subsequent development of collat-
eral blood vessels. Principal causes of acute arterial occlusion include 
embolism, thrombus in situ, arterial dissection, and trauma.

The most common sources of arterial emboli are the heart, aorta, 
and  large  arteries.  Cardiac  disorders  that  cause  thromboembolism 
include  atrial  fibrillation;  acute  myocardial  infarction;  ventricular 
aneurysm;  cardiomyopathy;  infectious  and  marantic  endocarditis; 
thrombi  associated  with  prosthetic  heart  valves;  and  atrial  myxoma. 
Emboli  to  the  distal  vessels  may  also  originate  from  proximal  sites 
of  atherosclerosis  and  aneurysms  of  the  aorta  and  large  vessels.  Less 
frequently,  an  arterial  occlusion  results  paradoxically  from  a  venous 
thrombus that has entered the systemic circulation via a patent fora-
men  ovale  or  another  septal  defect.  Arterial  emboli  tend  to  lodge  at 
vessel  bifurcations  because  the  vessel  caliber  decreases  at  those  sites; 
in the lower extremities, emboli lodge most frequently in the femoral 
artery, followed by the iliac artery, aorta, and popliteal and tibiopero-
neal arteries.

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular SystemAcute arterial thrombosis in situ occurs most frequently in athero-
sclerotic vessels at the site of an atherosclerotic plaque or aneurysm and 
in arterial bypass grafts. Trauma to an artery may disrupt continuity 
of blood flow and cause acute limb ischemia via formation of an acute 
arterial thrombus or by disruption of an artery’s integrity and extrava-
sation of blood. Arterial occlusion may complicate arterial punctures 
and placement of catheters; it also may result from arterial dissection 
if  the  intimal  flap  obstructs  the  artery.  Less  common  causes  include 
thoracic outlet compression syndrome, which causes subclavian artery 
occlusion, and entrapment of the popliteal artery by abnormal place-
ment of  the medial head  of the  gastrocnemius muscle. Polycythemia 
and hypercoagulable disorders (Chaps. 103 and 116) are also associ-
ated with acute arterial thrombosis.
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
The symptoms of an acute arterial occlusion depend on the location, 
duration, and severity of the obstruction. Often severe pain, paresthe-
sia, numbness, and coldness develop in the involved extremity within 
1 h. Paralysis may occur with severe and persistent ischemia. Physical 
findings include loss of pulses distal to the occlusion, cyanosis or pallor, 
mottling, decreased skin temperature, muscle stiffening, loss of sensa-
tion,  weakness,  and/or  absent  deep  tendon  reflexes.  If  acute  arterial 
occlusion occurs in the presence of an adequate collateral circulation, 
as is often the case in acute graft occlusion, the symptoms and findings 
may  be  less  severe.  In  this  situation,  the  patient  complains  about  an 
abrupt decrease in the distance walked before claudication occurs or 
of  modest  pain  and  paresthesia.  Pallor  and  coolness  are  evident,  but 
sensory  and  motor  functions  generally  are  preserved.  The  clinical 
evaluation includes Doppler assessment of peripheral blood flow. The 
diagnosis of acute limb ischemia is usually apparent from the clinical 
presentation.  In  most  circumstances,  MRA,  CTA,  or  catheter-based 
arteriography  is  used  to  confirm  the  diagnosis  and  demonstrate  the 
location and extent of arterial occlusion.

TREATMENT
Acute Limb Ischemia

Once  the  diagnosis  is  made,  the  patient  should  be  anticoagulated 
with  intravenous  heparin  to  prevent  propagation  of  the  clot  and 
recurrent  embolism.  In  cases  of  severe  ischemia  of  recent  onset, 
particularly when limb viability is jeopardized, immediate interven-
tion  to  ensure  reperfusion  is  indicated.  Catheter-directed  throm-
bolysis/thrombectomy, surgical thromboembolectomy, and arterial 
bypass  procedures  are  used  to  restore  blood  flow  to  the  ischemic 
extremity  promptly,  particularly  when  a  large  proximal  vessel  is 
occluded.

Intraarterial thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plas-
minogen activator, reteplase, or tenecteplase is most effective when 
acute arterial occlusion is recent (<2 weeks) and caused by a throm-
bus  in  an  atherosclerotic  vessel,  arterial  bypass  graft,  or  occluded 
stent.  Thrombolytic  therapy  is  also  indicated  when  the  patient’s 
overall  condition  contraindicates  surgical  intervention  or  when 
smaller distal vessels are occluded, thus preventing surgical access. 
Meticulous observation for hemorrhagic complications is required 
during  intraarterial  thrombolytic  therapy.  Ultrasound-emitting 
catheters may accelerate reperfusion by improving thrombus per-
meability to thrombolytic agents. Another endovascular approach 
to  thrombus  removal  is  percutaneous  mechanical  thrombectomy 
using devices that employ hydrodynamic forces or rotating baskets 
to  fragment  and  remove  the  clot.  These  treatments  may  be  used 
alone  but  usually  are  used  in  conjunction  with  pharmacologic 
thrombolysis.  Surgical  revascularization  is  preferred  when  res-
toration of blood flow must occur within 24 h to prevent limb loss 
or  when  symptoms  of  occlusion  have  been  present  for  >2  weeks. 
Amputation  is  performed  when  the  limb  is  not  viable,  as  charac-
terized by loss of sensation, paralysis, and the absence of Doppler-
detected blood flow in both arteries and veins.

Long-term anticoagulation is indicated when acute limb ische-
mia is caused by cardiac thromboembolism. Emboli resulting from 

infective  endocarditis,  the  presence  of  prosthetic  heart  valves,  or 
atrial  myxoma  often  require  surgical  intervention  to  remove  the 
cause.

 ■ ATHEROEMBOLISM
Atheroembolism is another cause of limb ischemia. In this condition, 
multiple  small  deposits  of  fibrin,  platelets,  and  cholesterol  debris 
embolize  from  proximal  atherosclerotic  lesions  or  aneurysmal  sites. 
Large protruding aortic atheromas are a source of emboli that may lead 
to limb ischemia, as well as stroke and renal insufficiency. Atheroem-
bolism  may  occur  after  intraarterial  procedures.  Since  atheroemboli 
to  limbs  tend  to  lodge  in  the  small  vessels  of  the  muscle  and  skin 
and  may  not  occlude  the  large  vessels,  distal  pulses  usually  remain 
palpable. Patients complain of acute pain and tenderness at the site of 
embolization.  Digital  vascular  occlusion  may  result  in  ischemia  and 
the  “blue  toe”  syndrome;  digital  necrosis  and  gangrene  may  develop  
(Fig. 281-2). Localized areas of tenderness, pallor, and livedo reticu-
laris (see below) occur at sites of emboli. Skin or muscle biopsy may 
demonstrate cholesterol crystals.

Ischemia  resulting  from  atheroemboli  is  notoriously  difficult  to 
treat. Local foot care and occasionally amputation may be needed to 
treat  necrotic  areas.  Analgesics  are  indicated  for  pain  relief.  Usually 
neither surgical revascularization procedures nor thrombolytic therapy 
is helpful because of the multiplicity, composition, and distal location 
of  the  emboli.  Therapy  with  antiplatelet  drugs  and  statins  improves 
cardiovascular  outcome  in  patients  with  atherosclerosis,  but  it  is  not 
established  whether  either  class  of  drugs  prevents  recurrent  athero-
embolism. Similarly, it is not known whether anticoagulant therapy is 
effective.  Endovascular  or  surgical  intervention  to  exclude  or  bypass 
the atherosclerotic vessel or aneurysm that causes the recurrent athe-
roemboli may be necessary.

 ■ THORACIC OUTLET COMPRESSION SYNDROME
This  is  a  symptom  complex  resulting  from  compression  of  the  neu-
rovascular bundle (artery, vein, or nerves) at the thoracic outlet as it 
courses through the neck and shoulder. Cervical ribs, abnormalities of 
the scalenus anticus muscle, proximity of the clavicle to the first rib, or 
abnormal insertion of the pectoralis minor muscle may compress the 
subclavian artery, subclavian vein, and brachial plexus as these struc-
tures  pass  from  the  thorax  to  the  arm.  Depending  on  the  structures 
affected, thoracic outlet compression syndrome is divided into arterial, 
venous, and neurogenic forms. Patients with neurogenic thoracic out-
let  compression  may  develop  shoulder  and  arm  pain,  weakness,  and 
paresthesias. Patients with arterial compression may experience clau-
dication,  Raynaud’s  phenomenon,  and  even  ischemic  tissue  loss  and 
gangrene. Venous compression may cause thrombosis of the subclavian 

FIGURE  281-2  Atheroembolism  causing  cyanotic  discoloration  and  impending 
necrosis of the toes (“blue toe” syndrome).

2112 and axillary veins; this is often associated with effort and is referred to 

as Paget-Schroetter syndrome.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Thoracic Outlet Compression Syndrome

Examination of a patient with arterial thoracic outlet compression 
syndrome  is  often  normal  unless  provocative  maneuvers  are  per-
formed.  Occasionally,  distal  pulses  are  decreased  or  absent  and 
digital cyanosis and ischemia may be evident.

Several maneuvers that support the diagnosis of arterial thoracic 
outlet  compression  syndrome  may  be  used  to  precipitate  symp-
toms,  cause  a  subclavian  artery  bruit,  and  diminish  arm  pulses. 
These maneuvers include the abduction and external rotation test, 
in  which  the  affected  arm  is  abducted  by  90°  and  the  shoulder  is 
externally rotated; the scalene maneuver (extension of the neck and 
rotation of the head to the side of the symptoms); the costoclavic-
ular maneuver (posterior rotation of shoulders); and the hyperab-
duction maneuver (raising the arm 180°). A chest x-ray will indicate 
the  presence  of  cervical  ribs.  Duplex  ultrasonography,  MRA,  and 
contrast angiography can be performed during provocative maneu-
vers to demonstrate thoracic outlet compression of the subclavian 
artery.  Neurophysiologic  tests  such  as  the  electromyogram,  nerve 
conduction  studies,  and  somatosensory  evoked  potentials  may  be 
abnormal  if  the  brachial  plexus  is  involved,  but  the  diagnosis  of 
neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is not necessarily excluded if 
these tests are normal owing to their low sensitivity.

Most  patients  can  be  managed  conservatively.  They  should  be 
advised to avoid the positions that cause symptoms. Many patients 
benefit from shoulder girdle exercises. Surgical procedures such as 
removal of the first rib and resection of the scalenus anticus muscle 
are  necessary  occasionally  for  relief  of  symptoms  or  treatment  of 
ischemia.

 ■ POPLITEAL ARTERY ENTRAPMENT
Popliteal  artery  entrapment  typically  affects  young  athletic  men  and 
women  when  the  gastrocnemius  or  popliteus  muscle  compresses 
the  popliteal  artery  and  causes  intermittent  claudication.  Thrombo-
sis,  embolism,  or  popliteal  artery  aneurysm  may  occur.  The  pulse 
examination  may  be  normal  unless  provocative  maneuvers  such  as 
ankle  dorsiflexion  and  plantar  flexion  are  performed.  The  diagnosis 
is confirmed by duplex ultrasound, CTA, MRA, or conventional angi-
ography. Treatment involves surgical release of the popliteal artery or 
vascular reconstruction.
 ■ POPLITEAL ARTERY ANEURYSM
Popliteal  artery  aneurysms  are  the  most  common  peripheral  artery 
aneurysms.  Approximately  50%  are  bilateral.  Patients  with  popliteal 
artery  aneurysms  often  have  aneurysms  of  other  arteries,  especially 
the  aorta.  The  most  common  clinical  presentation  is  limb  ischemia 
secondary to thrombosis or embolism. Rupture occurs less frequently. 
Other complications include compression of the adjacent popliteal vein 
or peroneal nerve. Popliteal artery aneurysm can be detected by palpa-
tion and confirmed by duplex ultrasonography. Repair is indicated for 
symptomatic aneurysms or when the diameter exceeds 2–3 cm, owing 
to the risk of thrombosis, embolism, or rupture.
 ■ ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA
Abnormal communications between an artery and a vein, bypassing the 
capillary bed, may be congenital or acquired. Congenital arteriovenous 
fistulas are a result of persistent embryonic vessels that fail to differen-
tiate into arteries and veins; they may be associated with birthmarks, 
can be located in almost any organ of the body, and frequently occur 
in the extremities. Acquired arteriovenous fistulas either are created to 
provide vascular access for hemodialysis or occur as a result of a pen-
etrating injury such as a gunshot or knife wound or as complications 
of arterial catheterization or surgical dissection. An uncommon cause 
of arteriovenous fistula is rupture of an arterial aneurysm into a vein.

The clinical features depend on the location and size of the fistula. 
Frequently, a pulsatile mass is palpable, and a thrill and a bruit lasting 
throughout systole and diastole are present over the fistula. With long-
standing fistulas, clinical manifestations of chronic venous insufficiency, 
including  peripheral  edema;  large,  tortuous  varicose  veins;  and  stasis 
pigmentation  become  apparent  because  of  the  high  venous  pressure. 
Evidence of ischemia may occur in the distal portion of the extremity. 
Skin temperature is higher over the arteriovenous fistula. Large arteri-
ovenous fistulas may result in an increased cardiac output with conse-
quent cardiomegaly and high-output heart failure (Chap. 257).

The diagnosis is often evident from the physical examination. Com-
pression of a large arteriovenous fistula may cause reflex slowing of the 
heart  rate  (Nicoladoni-Branham  sign).  Duplex  ultrasonography  may 
detect an arteriovenous fistula, especially one that affects the femoral 
artery  and  vein  at  the  site  of  catheter  access.  CTA  and  conventional 
angiography can confirm the diagnosis and are useful in demonstrat-
ing the site and size of the arteriovenous fistula.

Management  of  arteriovenous  fistulas  may  involve  surgery,  radio-
therapy,  or  embolization.  Congenital  arteriovenous  fistulas  are  often 
difficult  to  treat  because  the  communications  may  be  numerous  and 
extensive, and new communications frequently develop after ligation of 
the most obvious ones. Many of these lesions are best treated conserva-
tively using elastic support hose to reduce the consequences of venous 
hypertension.  Occasionally,  embolization  with  autologous  material, 
such as fat or muscle, or with hemostatic agents, such as gelatin sponges 
or  silicon  spheres,  is  used  to  obliterate  the  fistula.  Acquired  arterio-
venous fistulas are usually amenable to surgical treatment that involves 
division or excision of the fistula. Occasionally, autogenous or synthetic 
grafting is necessary to reestablish continuity of the artery and vein.

 ■ RAYNAUD’S PHENOMENON
Raynaud’s phenomenon is characterized by episodic digital ischemia, 
manifested clinically by the sequential development of digital blanch-
ing, cyanosis, and rubor of the fingers or toes after cold exposure and 
subsequent rewarming. Emotional stress may also precipitate Raynaud’s 
phenomenon. The color changes are usually well demarcated and are 
confined to the fingers or toes. Typically, one or more digits will appear 
white  when  the  patient  is  exposed  to  a  cold  environment  or  touches 
a  cold  object  (Fig.  281-3A).  The  blanching,  or  pallor,  represents  the 
ischemic  phase  of  the  phenomenon  and  results  from  vasospasm  of 
digital  arteries.  During  the  ischemic  phase,  capillaries  and  venules 
dilate, and cyanosis results from the deoxygenated blood that is present 
in these vessels. A sensation of cold or numbness or paresthesia of the 
digits often accompanies the phases of pallor and cyanosis.

With  rewarming,  the  digital  vasospasm  resolves,  and  blood  flow 
into  the  dilated  arterioles  and  capillaries  increases  dramatically.  This 
“reactive hyperemia” imparts a bright red color to the digits. In addi-
tion  to  rubor  and  warmth,  patients  often  experience  a  throbbing, 
painful sensation during the hyperemic phase. Although the triphasic 
color response is typical of Raynaud’s phenomenon, some patients may 
develop only pallor and cyanosis; others may experience only cyanosis.
Raynaud’s  phenomenon  is  broadly  separated  into  two  categories: 
idiopathic,  termed  primary  Raynaud’s  phenomenon,  and  secondary 
Raynaud’s phenomenon, which is associated with other disease states 
or known causes of vasospasm (Table 281-1).

Primary  Raynaud’s  Phenomenon  This  appellation  is  applied 
when  the  secondary  causes  of  Raynaud’s  phenomenon  have  been 
excluded. Over 50% of patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon have the 
primary form. Women are affected about five times more often than 
men, and the age of presentation is usually between 20 and 40 years. 
The fingers are involved more frequently than the toes. Initial episodes 
may  involve  only  one  or  two  fingertips,  but  subsequent  attacks  may 
involve the entire finger and may include all the fingers. The toes are 
affected  in  40%  of  patients.  Although  vasospasm  of  the  toes  usually 
occurs in patients with symptoms in the fingers, it may happen alone. 
Rarely,  the  earlobes,  the  tip  of  the  nose,  tongue,  nipple,  or  penis  are 
involved.  Raynaud’s  phenomenon  occurs  frequently  in  patients  who 
also  have  migraine  headaches  or  variant  angina.  These  associations

suggest  that  there  may  be  a  common  predisposing  cause  for  the 
vasospasm.

Results of physical examination are often entirely normal; the radial, 
ulnar, and pedal pulses are normal. The fingers and toes may be cool 
between attacks and may perspire excessively. Nailfold capillaroscopy 
reveals normal superficial capillaries, which appear as regularly spaced 
hairpin loops. Thickening and tightening of the digital subcutaneous 
tissue  (sclerodactyly)  develop  in  10%  of  patients.  Angiography  of  the 
digits for diagnostic purposes is not indicated.

In  general,  patients  with  primary  Raynaud’s  disease  have  milder 
clinical manifestations. Fewer than 1% of these patients lose a part of a 
digit. After the diagnosis is made, the disease improves spontaneously 
in ~15% of patients and progresses in ~30%.

Secondary  Causes  of  Raynaud’s  Phenomenon  Raynaud’s 
phenomenon  occurs  in  80–90%  of  patients  with  systemic  sclerosis 
(scleroderma)  and  is  the  presenting  symptom  in  30%  (Chap.  360). 
It  may  be  the  only  symptom  of  scleroderma  for  many  years.  Abnor-
malities  of  the  digital  vessels  may  contribute  to  the  development  of 
Raynaud’s phenomenon in this disorder. Ischemic fingertip ulcers may 
develop  and  progress  to  gangrene  and  autoamputation.  About  20% 
of  patients  with  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE)  have  Raynaud’s 
phenomenon  (Chap.  356).  Occasionally,  persistent  digital  ischemia 
develops and may result in ulcers or gangrene. In most severe cases, 
the small vessels are occluded by a proliferative endarteritis. Raynaud’s 
phenomenon  occurs  in  ~30%  of  patients  with  dermatomyositis  or 
polymyositis (Chap. 365). It frequently develops in patients with rheu-
matoid  arthritis  and  may  be  related  to  the  intimal  proliferation  that 
occurs in the digital arteries.

Atherosclerosis of the extremities is a common cause of Raynaud’s 
phenomenon in men aged >50 years. Thromboangiitis obliterans is an 
uncommon cause of Raynaud’s phenomenon but should be considered 

in young men, particularly those who are cigarette smokers. The devel-
opment of cold-induced pallor in these disorders may be confined to 
one  or  two  digits  of  the  involved  extremity.  Occasionally,  Raynaud’s 
phenomenon  may  follow  acute  occlusion  of  large  and  medium-sized 
arteries  by  a  thrombus  or  embolus.  Embolization  of  atheroembolic 
debris  may  cause  digital  ischemia.  The  latter  situation  often  involves 
one  or  two  digits  and  should  not  be  confused  with  Raynaud’s  phe-
nomenon.  In  patients  with  thoracic  outlet  compression  syndrome, 
Raynaud’s  phenomenon  may  result  from  diminished  intravascular 
pressure, stimulation of sympathetic fibers in the brachial plexus, or a 
combination of both. Raynaud’s phenomenon occurs in patients with

2114 primary pulmonary hypertension (Chap. 283); this is more than coin-
cidental and may reflect a neurohumoral abnormality that affects both 
the pulmonary and digital circulations.

A variety of blood dyscrasias may be associated with Raynaud’s phe-
nomenon. Cold-induced precipitation of plasma proteins, hyperviscos-
ity, and aggregation of red cells and platelets may occur in patients with 
cold agglutinins, cryoglobulinemia, or cryofibrinogenemia. Hypervis-
cosity  syndromes  that  accompany  myeloproliferative  disorders  and 
lymphoplasmacytic  lymphoma  (Waldenström’s  macroglobulinemia) 
should  also  be  considered  in  the  initial  evaluation  of  patients  with 
Raynaud’s phenomenon.

Raynaud’s  phenomenon  occurs  often  in  patients  whose  vocations 
require  the  use  of  vibrating  hand  tools,  such  as  chain  saws  or  jack-
hammers. The frequency of Raynaud’s phenomenon also seems to be 
increased in pianists and keyboard operators. Electric shock injury to 
the hands or frostbite may lead to the later development of Raynaud’s 
phenomenon.

Several drugs have been causally implicated in Raynaud’s phenom-
enon.  They  include  ergot  preparations,  methysergide,  β-adrenergic 
receptor  antagonists,  and  the  chemotherapeutic  agents  bleomycin, 
vinblastine, cisplatin, and gemcitabine.

TREATMENT
Raynaud’s Phenomenon

Most  patients  with  Raynaud’s  phenomenon  experience  only  mild 
and  infrequent  episodes.  These  patients  need  reassurance  and 
should be instructed to dress warmly and avoid unnecessary cold 
exposure. In addition to gloves and mittens, patients should protect 
the  trunk,  head,  and  feet  with  warm  clothing  to  prevent  cold- 
induced reflex vasoconstriction. Tobacco use is contraindicated.

Drug  treatment  should  be  reserved  for  severe  cases.  Dihydro-
pyridine calcium channel antagonists such as nifedipine, isradipine, 
felodipine,  and  amlodipine  decrease  the  frequency  and  severity 
of  Raynaud’s  phenomenon.  Diltiazem  may  be  considered  but  is 
less  effective.  The  postsynaptic  α1-adrenergic  antagonist  prazosin 
has  been  used  with  favorable  responses;  doxazosin  and  terazosin 
may  also  be  effective.  Phosphodiesterase  type  5  inhibitors  such 
as  sildenafil,  tadalafil,  and  vardenafil  may  improve  symptoms  in 
patients  with  secondary  Raynaud’s  phenomenon,  as  occurs  with 
systemic sclerosis. There is also evidence that topical nitroglycerin 
preparations  are  effective.  Digital  sympathectomy  is  helpful  in 
some patients who are unresponsive to medical therapy. Injection 
of botulinum toxin into the perivascular tissue of the wrist or palm 
improved  ischemic  manifestations  of  severe  Raynaud’s  phenome-
non in case series, but controlled clinical trials are lacking.

 ■ ACROCYANOSIS
In this condition, there is arterial vasoconstriction and secondary dila-
tion of the capillaries and venules with resulting persistent cyanosis of 
the hands and, less frequently, the feet. Cyanosis may be intensified by 
exposure to a cold environment. Acrocyanosis may be categorized as 
primary or secondary to an underlying condition. In primary acrocy-
anosis, women are affected much more frequently than men, and the 
age of onset is usually <30 years. Generally, patients are asymptomatic 
but seek medical attention because of the discoloration. The prognosis 
is favorable, and pain, ulcers, and gangrene do not occur. Examination 
reveals normal pulses, peripheral cyanosis, and moist palms (Fig. 281-3B). 
Trophic skin changes and ulcerations do not occur. The disorder can 
be distinguished from Raynaud’s phenomenon because it is persistent 
and not episodic, the discoloration extends proximally from the digits, 
and blanching does not occur. Ischemia secondary to arterial occlusive 
disease can usually be excluded by the presence of normal pulses. Cen-
tral cyanosis and decreased arterial oxygen saturation are not present. 
Patients  should  be  reassured  and  advised  to  dress  warmly  and  avoid 
cold exposure. Pharmacologic intervention is not indicated.

Secondary  acrocyanosis  may  result  from  hypoxemia,  vaso-
pressor  medications,  connective  tissue  diseases,  atheroembolism, 

antiphospholipid antibodies, cold agglutinins, or cryoglobulins and is 
associated with anorexia nervosa and postural orthostatic tachycardia 
syndrome. Treatment should be directed at the underlying disorder.
 ■ LIVEDO RETICULARIS
In  this  condition,  localized  areas  of  the  extremities  develop  a  mot-
tled  or  rete  (netlike)  appearance  of  reddish  to  blue  discoloration  
(Fig.  281-3C).  There  are  primary  and  secondary  forms  of  livedo 
reticularis.  The  primary,  or  idiopathic,  form  of  this  disorder  may  be 
benign or associated with ulcerations. The benign form occurs more 
frequently in women than in men, and the most common age of onset 
is the third decade. The mottling typically is symmetric and uniform 
and  may  be  more  prominent  after  cold  exposure  and  improve  with 
warming.  Patients  with  the  benign  form  are  usually  asymptomatic 
and  seek  attention  for  cosmetic  reasons.  These  patients  should  be 
reassured and advised to avoid cold environments. No drug treatment 
is  indicated.  Primary  livedo  reticularis  with  ulceration  is  also  called 
atrophie blanche en plaque. The ulcers are painful and may take months 
to  heal.  Secondary  livedo  reticularis  can  occur  with  atheroembolism 
(see  above),  SLE  and  other  vasculitides,  antiphospholipid  antibodies, 
hyperviscosity, cryoglobulinemia, and Sneddon’s syndrome (ischemic 
stroke  and  livedo  reticularis).  Livedo  racemosa  is  the  term  used  to 
characterize secondary livedo reticularis, when the mottling is irregu-
lar  and  disrupted,  and  does  not  improve  with  warming.  Rarely,  skin 
ulcerations develop.
 ■ PERNIO (CHILBLAINS)
Pernio is a vasculitic disorder associated with exposure to cold; acute 
forms have been described. Raised erythematous lesions develop most 
commonly on the toes or fingers in cold weather (Fig. 281-3D). They 
are  associated  with  pruritus  and  a  burning  sensation,  and  they  may 
blister  and  ulcerate.  Pathologic  examination  demonstrates  angiitis 
characterized  by  intimal  proliferation  and  perivascular  infiltration  of 
mononuclear  and  polymorphonuclear  leukocytes.  Giant  cells  may  be 
present  in  the  subcutaneous  tissue.  Patients  should  avoid  exposure 
to  cold,  and  ulcers  should  be  kept  clean  and  protected  with  sterile 
dressings. Sympatholytic drugs and dihydropyridine calcium channel 
antagonists may be effective in some patients.
 ■ ERYTHROMELALGIA
This  disorder  is  characterized  by  burning  pain  and  erythema  of  the 
extremities  (Fig.  281-3E).  The  feet  are  involved  more  frequently 
than the hands, and males are affected more frequently than females. 
Erythromelalgia may occur at any age but is most common in middle 
age.  It  may  be  primary  (also  termed  erythermalgia)  or  secondary. 
Mutations  in  the  SCN9A  gene,  which  encodes  the  Nav1.7  voltage-
gated  sodium  channel  expressed  in  sensory  and  sympathetic  nerves, 
have been described in inherited forms of erythromelalgia. The most 
common  causes  of  secondary  erythromelalgia  are  myeloproliferative 
disorders  such  as  polycythemia  vera  and  essential  thrombocytosis. 
Less common causes include drugs, such as calcium channel blockers, 
bromocriptine, and pergolide; neuropathies; connective tissue diseases 
such as SLE; and paraneoplastic syndromes. Patients complain of burn-
ing in the extremities that is precipitated by exposure to a warm envi-
ronment and aggravated by a dependent position. The symptoms are 
relieved by exposing the affected area to cool air or water or by eleva-
tion. Erythromelalgia can be distinguished from ischemia secondary to 
peripheral arterial disorders because the peripheral pulses are present. 
There is no specific treatment; aspirin may produce relief in patients 
with erythromelalgia secondary to myeloproliferative disease. Topical 
anesthetics may be considered to relieve pain. Treatment of associated 
disorders in secondary erythromelalgia may be helpful.
 ■ FROSTBITE
In  this  condition,  tissue  damage  results  from  severe  environmental 
cold  exposure  or  from  direct  contact  with  a  very  cold  object.  Tissue 
injury  results  from  both  freezing  and  vasoconstriction.  Frostbite 
usually affects the distal aspects of the extremities or exposed parts of 
the face, such as the ears, nose, chin, and cheeks. Superficial frostbite 
involves the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Patients experience pain or 

HPIM21e_Part6_p1797-p2130.indd   2114

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular Systemparesthesia,  and  the  skin  appears  white  and  waxy.  After  rewarming, 
there is cyanosis and erythema, wheal-and-flare formation, edema, and 
superficial blisters. Deep frostbite involves muscle, nerves, and deeper 
blood vessels. It may result in edema of the hand or foot, vesicles and 
bullae, tissue necrosis, and gangrene (Fig. 281-3F).

Initial treatment is rewarming, performed in an environment where 
reexposure to freezing conditions will not occur. Rewarming is accom-
plished by immersion of the affected part in a water bath at tempera-
tures of 40°–44°C (104°–111°F). Massage, application of ice water, and 
extreme heat are contraindicated. The injured area should be cleansed 
with soap or antiseptic, and sterile dressings should be applied. Analge-
sics are often required during rewarming. Antibiotics are used if there 
is  evidence  of  infection.  The  efficacy  of  sympathetic  blocking  drugs 
is  not  established.  After  recovery,  the  affected  extremity  may  exhibit 
increased sensitivity to cold.

and Lymphedema
Mark A. Creager, Joseph Loscalzo

 ■ CHRONIC VENOUS DISEASE
Chronic  venous  diseases  range  from  telangiectasias  and  reticular 
veins,  to  varicose  veins,  to  chronic  venous  insufficiency  with  edema, 
skin  changes,  and  ulceration.  This  section  of  the  chapter  will  focus 
on identification and treatment of varicose veins and chronic venous 
insufficiency, since these problems are encountered frequently by the 
internist.  The  estimated  prevalence  of  varicose  veins  in  the  United 
States  is  ~15%  in  men  and  30%  in  women.  Chronic  venous  insuffi-
ciency with edema affects ~7.5% of men and 5% of women, and the 
prevalence increases with age ranging from 2% among those <50 years 
of age to 10% of those 70 years of age. Approximately 20% of patients 
with chronic venous insufficiency develop venous ulcers.

 ■ VENOUS ANATOMY
Veins in the extremities can be broadly classified as either superficial 
or deep. The superficial veins are located between the skin and deep 
fascia. In the legs, these include the great and small saphenous veins 
and their tributaries. The great saphenous vein is the longest vein in the 
body. It originates on the medial side of the foot and ascends anterior 
to the medial malleolus and then along the medial side of the calf and 
thigh, and drains into the common femoral vein. The small saphenous 
vein originates on the dorsolateral aspect of the foot, ascends posterior 
to the lateral malleolus and along the posterolateral aspect of the calf, 
and  drains  into  the  popliteal  vein.  The  deep  veins  of  the  leg  accom-
pany  the  major  arteries.  There  are  usually  paired  peroneal,  anterior 
tibial, and posterior tibial veins in the calf, which converge to form the 
popliteal vein. Soleal tributary veins drain into the posterior tibial or 
peroneal veins, and gastrocnemius tributary veins drain into the pop-
liteal vein. The popliteal vein ascends in the thigh as the femoral vein. 
The  confluence  of  the  femoral  vein  and  deep  femoral  vein  form  the 
common femoral vein, which ascends in the pelvis as the external iliac 
and  then  common  iliac  vein,  which  converges  with  the  contralateral 
common iliac vein at the inferior vena cava. Perforating veins connect 
the superficial and deep systems in the legs at multiple locations, nor-
mally allowing blood to flow from the superficial to deep veins. In the 
arms,  the  superficial  veins  include  the  basilic,  cephalic,  and  median 
cubital veins and their tributaries. The basilic and cephalic veins course 
along the medial and lateral aspects of the arm, respectively, and these 
are  connected  via  the  median  cubital  vein  in  the  antecubital  fossa.  
The deep veins of the arms accompany the major arteries and include 
the radial, ulnar, brachial, axillary, and subclavian veins. The subcla-
vian vein converges with the internal jugular vein to form the brachio-
cephalic  vein,  which  joins  the  contralateral  brachiocephalic  vein  to 
form  the  superior  vena  cava.  Bicuspid  valves  are  present  throughout 
the venous system to direct the flow of venous blood centrally.

Pathophysiology  of  Chronic  Venous  Disease  Varicose  veins 
are  dilated,  bulging,  tortuous  superficial  veins,  measuring  at  least  
3  mm  in  diameter.  The  smaller  and  less  tortuous  reticular  veins  are 
dilated intradermal veins, which appear blue-green, measure 1–3 mm 
in diameter, and do not protrude from the skin surface. Telangiectasias, 
or  spider  veins,  are  small,  dilated  veins,  <1  mm  in  diameter,  located 
near the skin surface, and form blue, purple, or red linear, branching, 
or spider-web patterns.

Varicose veins can be categorized as primary or secondary. Primary 
varicose  veins  originate  in  the  superficial  system  and  result  from 
defective structure and function of the valves of the saphenous veins, 
intrinsic  weakness  of  the  vein  wall,  and  high  intraluminal  pressure. 
Approximately  one-half  of  these  patients  have  a  family  history  of 
varicose  veins.  Other  factors  associated  with  primary  varicose  veins 
include  aging,  pregnancy,  hormonal  therapy,  obesity,  and  prolonged 
standing.  Secondary  varicose  veins  result  from  venous  hypertension, 
associated  with  deep-venous  insufficiency  or  deep-venous  obstruc-
tion,  and  incompetent  perforating  veins  that  cause  enlargement  of 
superficial veins. Arteriovenous fistulas also cause varicose veins in the 
affected limb.

Chronic venous insufficiency is a consequence of incompetent veins 
in which there is venous hypertension and extravasation of fluid and 
blood  elements  into  the  tissue  of  the  limb.  It  may  occur  in  patients 
with varicose veins but usually is caused by disease in the deep veins. 
It  also  is  categorized  as  primary  or  secondary.  Primary  deep-venous 
insufficiency is a consequence of an intrinsic structural or functional 
abnormality in the vein wall or venous valves leading to valvular reflux. 
Secondary deep-venous insufficiency is caused by obstruction and/or 
valvular incompetence from previous deep-vein thrombosis (Chap. 279). 
Deep-venous insufficiency occurs following deep-vein thrombosis, as 
the  delicate  valve  leaflets  become  thickened  and  contracted  and  can 
no longer prevent retrograde flow of blood and the vein itself becomes 
rigid and thick walled. Although most veins recanalize after an episode 
of  thrombosis,  the  large  proximal  veins  may  remain  occluded.  Sec-
ondary incompetence develops in distal valves because high pressures 
distend  the  vein  and  separate  the  leaflets.  Other  causes  of  secondary

2116 deep-venous insufficiency include May-Thurner syndrome, where the 
left  iliac  vein  is  occluded  or  stenosed  by  extrinsic  compression  from 
the overlapping right common iliac artery; extrinsic compression from 
tumor  or  retroperitoneal  fibrosis;  arteriovenous  fistulas  resulting  in 
increased venous pressure; congenital deep-vein agenesis or hypopla-
sia; and venous malformations as may occur in Klippel-Trénaunay and 
Parkes-Weber syndromes.

Clinical Presentation  Patients with venous varicosities are often 
asymptomatic  but  still  concerned  about  the  cosmetic  appearance  of 
their legs. Superficial venous thrombosis may be a recurring problem, 
and rarely, a varicosity ruptures and bleeds. Symptoms in patients with 
varicose veins or venous insufficiency, when they occur, include a dull 
ache, throbbing or heaviness, or pressure sensation in the legs typically 
after  prolonged  standing;  these  symptoms  usually  are  relieved  with 
leg  elevation.  Additional  symptoms  may  include  cramping,  burning, 
pruritus, leg swelling, and skin ulceration.

The  legs  are  examined  in  both  the  supine  and  standing  positions. 
Visual  inspection  and  palpation  of  the  legs  in  the  standing  position 
confirm  the  presence  of  varicose  veins.  The  location  and  extent  of 
the varicose veins should be noted. Edema, stasis dermatitis, and skin 
ulceration near the ankle may be present if there is superficial venous 
insufficiency  and  venous  hypertension.  Findings  of  deep-venous 
insufficiency include increased leg circumference, venous varicosities, 
edema,  and  skin  changes.  The  edema,  which  is  usually  pitting,  may 
be  confined  to  the  ankles,  extend  above  the  ankles  to  the  knees,  or 
involve the thighs in severe cases. Over time, the edema may become 
less  pitting  and  more  indurated.  Dermatologic  findings  associated 
with  venous  stasis  include  hyperpigmentation,  erythema,  eczema, 
lipodermatosclerosis,  atrophie  blanche,  and  a  phlebectasia  corona. 
Lipodermatosclerosis  is  the  combination  of  induration,  hemosiderin 
deposition, and inflammation, and typically occurs in the lower part of 
the leg just above the ankle. Atrophie blanche is a white patch of scar 
tissue, often with focal telangiectasias and a hyperpigmented border; 
it  usually  develops  near  the  medial  malleolus.  A  phlebectasia  corona 
is a fan-shaped pattern of intradermal veins near the ankle or on the 
foot. Skin ulceration may occur near the medial and lateral malleoli. A 
venous ulcer is often shallow and characterized by an irregular border, 
a base of granulation tissue, and the presence of exudate (Fig. 282-1).

Bedside  maneuvers  can  be  used  to  distinguish  primary  varicose 
veins  from  secondary  varicose  veins  caused  by  deep-venous  insuf-
ficiency.  With  the  contemporary  use  of  venous  ultrasound  (see 
below),  however,  these  maneuvers  are  employed  infrequently.  The 
Brodie-Trendelenburg test is used to determine whether varicose veins 
are  secondary  to  deep-venous  insufficiency.  As  the  patient  is  lying 
supine,  the  leg  is  elevated  and  the  veins  allowed  to  empty.  Then,  a 
tourniquet is placed on the proximal part of the thigh and the patient 
is  asked  to  stand.  Filling  of  the  varicose  veins  within  30  s  indicates 
that  the  varicose  veins  are  caused  by  deep-venous  insufficiency  and 
incompetent perforating veins. Primary varicose veins with superficial 
venous insufficiency are the likely diagnosis if venous refilling occurs 
promptly  after  tourniquet  removal.  The  Perthes  test  assesses  the 
possibility of deep-venous obstruction. A tourniquet is placed on the 
midthigh after the patient has stood, and the varicose veins are filled. 
The patient is then instructed to walk for 5 min. A patent deep-venous 
system  and  competent  perforating  veins  enable  the  superficial  veins 
below the tourniquet to collapse. Deep-venous obstruction is likely to 
be present if the superficial veins distend further with walking.

Differential Diagnosis  The duration of leg edema helps to distin-
guish chronic venous insufficiency from acute deep-vein thrombosis. 
Lymphedema, as discussed later in this chapter, is often confused with 
chronic venous insufficiency, and both may occur together. Other dis-
orders that cause leg swelling should be considered and excluded when 
evaluating a patient with presumed venous insufficiency. Bilateral leg 
swelling  occurs  in  patients  with  congestive  heart  failure,  hypoalbu-
minemia secondary to nephrotic syndrome or severe hepatic disease, 
or myxedema caused by hypothyroidism or pretibial myxedema asso-
ciated  with  Graves’  disease,  and  with  drugs  such  as  dihydropyridine 
calcium channel blockers and thiazolidinediones. Unilateral causes of 
leg swelling also include ruptured leg muscles, hematomas secondary 
to trauma, and popliteal cysts. Cellulitis may cause erythema and swell-
ing of the affected limb. Leg ulcers may be caused by severe peripheral 
artery  disease  and  critical  limb  ischemia;  neuropathies,  particularly 
those  associated  with  diabetes;  and  less  commonly,  skin  cancer,  vas-
culitis,  or  rarely  as  a  complication  of  hydroxyurea.  The  location  and 
characteristics of venous ulcers help to differentiate these from other 
causes.

Classification of Chronic Venous Disease  The CEAP (clinical, 
etiologic,  anatomic,  pathophysiologic)  classification  schema  incor-
porates  the  range  of  symptoms  and  signs  of  chronic  venous  disease 
to  characterize  its  severity.  It  also  broadly  categorizes  the  etiology 
as  primary,  secondary,  or  congenital;  identifies  the  affected  veins  as 
superficial, deep, or perforating; and characterizes the pathophysiology 
as reflux, obstruction, both, or neither (Table 282-1).

Diagnostic  Testing  The  principal  diagnostic  test  to  evaluate 
patients  with  chronic  venous  disease  is  venous  duplex  ultrasonogra-
phy. A venous duplex ultrasound examination uses a combination of 
B-mode imaging and spectral Doppler to detect the presence of venous 
obstruction  and  venous  reflux  in  superficial  and  deep  veins.  Color- 
assisted Doppler ultrasound is useful to visualize venous flow patterns. 
Obstruction  may  be  diagnosed  by  the  absence  of  flow,  the  presence 
of  an  echogenic  thrombus  within  the  vein,  or  failure  of  the  vein  to 
collapse when a compression maneuver is applied by the sonographer, 
the last implicating the presence of an intraluminal thrombus. Venous 
reflux is detected by prolonged reversal of venous flow direction dur-
ing a Valsalva maneuver, particularly for the common femoral vein or 
saphenofemoral  junction,  or  after  compression  and  release  of  a  cuff 
placed on the limb distal to the area being interrogated.

Some vascular laboratories use air or strange gauge plethysmogra-
phy  to  assess  the  severity  of  venous  reflux  and  complement  findings 
from the venous ultrasound examination. Venous volume and venous 
refilling  time  are  measured  when  the  legs  are  placed  in  a  dependent 
position and after calf exercise to quantify the severity of venous reflux 
and the efficiency of the calf muscle pump to affect venous return.

Magnetic  resonance,  computed  tomographic,  and  conventional 
venography are rarely required to determine the cause and plan treat-
ment  for  chronic  venous  insufficiency  unless  there  is  suspicion  for 
pathology that might warrant intervention. These modalities are used 
to identify obstruction or stenosis of the inferior vena cava and iliofem-
oral veins, as may occur in patients with previous proximal deep-vein 
thrombosis; occlusion of inferior vena cava filters; extrinsic compres-
sion from tumors; and May-Thurner syndrome.

TREATMENT
Chronic Venous Disease 

SUPPORTIVE MEASURES
Varicose  veins  usually  are  treated  with  conservative  measures. 
Symptoms  often  decrease  when  the  legs  are  elevated  periodi-
cally,  prolonged  standing  is  avoided,  and  elastic  support  hose 
are  worn.  External  compression  with  elastic  stockings,  multilayer 
elastic  wraps,  stretch  bandages,  or  inelastic  garments  provides  a 
counterbalance to the hydrostatic pressure in the veins. Although 
compression garments may improve symptoms, they do not prevent 
progression  of  varicose  veins.  Graduated  compression  stockings 
with pressures of 20–30 mmHg are suitable for most patients with 
simple  varicose  veins,  although  higher  pressures  may  be  required

for patients with varicose veins and manifestations of venous insuf-
ficiency such as edema and ulcers.

Patients with chronic venous insufficiency also should be advised 
to  avoid  prolonged  standing  or  sitting;  frequent  leg  elevation  is 
helpful.  Graded  compression  therapy  consisting  of  stockings  or 
multilayered  compression  bandages  is  the  standard  of  care  for 
advanced  chronic  venous  insufficiency  characterized  by  edema, 
skin changes, or venous ulcers defined as CEAP clinical class C3–
C6.  Graduated  compression  stockings  of  30–40  mmHg  are  more 
effective  than  lesser  grades  for  healing  venous  ulcers.  The  length 
of  stocking  depends  on  the  distribution  of  edema.  Calf-length 
stockings are tolerated better by most patients, particularly elderly 
patients; for patients with varicose veins or edema extending to the 
thigh, thigh-length stockings or panty hose should be considered. 
Exercise training, including leg muscle strengthening, may improve 
calf muscle pump function and antegrade venous flow, and reduce 
the severity of chronic venous insufficiency. Overweight and obese 
patients should be advised to lose weight via caloric restriction and 
exercise.

In  addition  to  a  compression  bandage  or  stocking,  patients 
with venous ulcers also may be treated with low-adherent absor-
bent  dressings  that  take  up  exudates  while  maintaining  a  moist 
environment.  Other  types  of  dressings  include  hydrocolloid  (an 
adhesive  dressing  composed  of  polymers  such  as  carboxymeth-
ylcellulose  that  absorbs  exudates  by  forming  a  gel),  hydrogel   
(a  nonabsorbent  dressing  comprising  >80%  water  or  glycerin 
that  moisturizes  wounds),  foam  (an  absorbent  dressing  made 
with polymers such as polyurethane), and alginate (an absorbent, 
biodegradable  dressing  that  is  derived  from  seaweed),  but  there 
is little evidence that these are more effective than low-adherent 
absorbent  dressings.  The  choice  of  specific  dressing  depends  on 
the amount of drainage, presence of infection, and integrity of the 
skin surrounding the ulcer. Ulcers should be debrided of necrotic 
tissue.  Antibiotics  are  not  indicated  unless  the  ulcer  is  infected. 
The multilayered compression bandage or graduated compression 
garment is then put over the dressing. 

MEDICAL THERAPIES
There are no drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency. Diuret-
ics  may  reduce  edema,  but  at  the  risk  of  volume  depletion  and 
compromise in renal function. Topical steroids may be used for a 
short  period  of  time  to  treat  inflammation  associated  with  stasis 
dermatitis.  Several  herbal  supplements,  such  as  horse  chestnut 
seed extract (aescin); flavonoids, including diosmin, hesperidin, or 
the  two  combined  as  micronized  purified  flavonoid  fraction;  and 
French maritime pine bark extract, are touted to have venoconstric-
tive  and  anti-inflammatory  properties.  Although  meta-analyses 
have suggested that aescin reduces edema, pruritus, and pain and 
that  micronized  purified  flavonoid  fraction  in  conjunction  with 
compression therapy facilitates venous ulcer healing, there is insuf-
ficient evidence to recommend the general use of these substances 
in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. 

INTERVENTIONAL AND SURGICAL THERAPIES
Ablative  procedures,  including  endovenous  thermal  and  nonther-
mal ablation, sclerotherapy, and surgery, are used to treat varicose 
veins  in  selected  patients  who  have  persistent  symptoms,  great 
saphenous vein incompetency, and complications of venous insuf-
ficiency including dermatitis, edema, and ulcers. Ablative therapy 
may also be indicated for cosmetic reasons.

Endovenous thermal ablation procedures of the saphenous veins 
include  endovenous  laser  therapy  and  radiofrequency  ablation. 
To  ablate  the  great  saphenous  vein,  a  catheter  is  placed  percuta-
neously and advanced from the level of the knee to just below the 
saphenofemoral junction via ultrasound guidance. Thermal energy 
is then delivered as the catheter is pulled back. The heat injures the 
endothelium  and  media  and  promotes  thrombosis  and  fibrosis,

resulting in venous occlusion. Average 1- and 5-year occlusion rates 
exceed 90% following endovenous laser therapy and are slightly less 
after  radiofrequency  ablation.  Deep-vein  thrombosis  of  the  com-
mon  femoral  vein  adjacent  to  the  saphenofemoral  junction  is  an 
uncommon but potential complication of endovenous thermal abla-
tion. Other adverse effects of thermal ablation procedures include 
pain, paresthesias, bruising, hematoma, and hyperpigmentation.

Nonthermal ablation procedures of the saphenous veins include 
endovenous  delivery  of  a  cyanoacrylate  tissue  adhesive,  which 
causes  fibrosis,  and  mechanochemical  ablation,  which  involves 
insertion of a rotating wire to injure the endothelium and infusion 
of  a  liquid  sclerosant.  One-year  occlusion  rates  approximate  or 
exceed  90%,  respectively.  Adverse  effects  of  nonthermal  ablation 
procedures include superficial thrombophlebitis, deep vein throm-
bosis, ecchymoses, hematomas, and hyperpigmentation.

Sclerotherapy involves the injection of a chemical into a vein to 
cause  fibrosis  and  obstruction.  Sclerosing  agents  approved  by  the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration include sodium tetradecyl sul-
fate, polidocanol, sodium morrhuate, and glycerin. The sclerosing 
agent  is  administered  as  a  liquid  or  mixed  with  air  or  CO2/O2  to 
create  a  foam.  It  is  first  injected  into  the  great  saphenous  vein  or 
its affected tributaries, often with ultrasound guidance. Thereafter, 
smaller  more  distal  veins  and  incompetent  perforating  veins  are 
injected.  Following  completion  of  the  procedure,  elastic  bandages 
are  applied,  or  30–40  mmHg  compression  stockings  are  worn  for 
1–2 weeks. Average 1- and 5-year occlusion rates are 81 and 74%, 
respectively, following sclerotherapy. Complications are uncommon 
and include deep-vein thrombosis, hematomas, damage to adjacent 
saphenous or sural nerves, and infection. Anaphylaxis is a very rare 
but severe complication.

Surgical  therapy  usually  involves  ligation  and  stripping  of  the 
great and small saphenous veins. The procedure is performed under 
general anesthesia. Incisions are made at the groin and the upper 
calf. The great saphenous vein is ligated below the saphenofemoral 
junction, and a wire is inserted into the great saphenous vein and 
advanced distally. The proximal part of the great saphenous vein is 
secured to the wire and retrieved, i.e., stripped, via the calf incision. 
Stripping of the great saphenous vein below the knee and stripping 
of the small saphenous vein usually are not performed because of 
the respective risks of saphenous and sural nerve injury. Complica-
tions of great saphenous vein ligation and stripping include deep- 
vein thrombosis, bleeding, hematoma, infection, and nerve injury. 
Recurrent varicose veins occur in up to 50% patients by 5 years, due 
to  technical  failures,  deep-venous  insufficiency,  and  incompetent 
perforating veins.

Stab  phlebectomy  is  another  surgical  treatment  for  varicose 
veins. A small incision is made alongside the varicose vein, and it 
is avulsed by means of a forceps or hook. This procedure may be 
performed in conjunction with saphenous vein ligation and strip-
ping or thermal ablation. Subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery 
(SEPS)  uses  endoscopy  to  identify  and  occlude  incompetent  per-
forating veins. It also may be performed along with other ablative 
procedures.

Endovascular  interventions,  surgical  bypass,  and  reconstruc-
tion  of  the  valves  of  the  deep  veins  are  performed  when  feasible 
to  treat  patients  with  advanced  chronic  venous  insufficiency  who 
have  not  responded  to  other  therapies.  Catheter-based  interven-
tions,  usually  involving  placement  of  endovenous  stents,  may  be 
considered  to  treat  some  patients  with  chronic  occlusions  of  the 
iliac veins. Technical success rates exceed 85% in most series, and 
long-term patency is achieved in ~75% of these patients. Iliocaval 
bypass,  femoroiliac  venous  bypass,  and  femorofemoral  crossover 
venous bypass are procedures used occasionally to treat iliofemoral 
vein  occlusion;  saphenopopliteal  vein  bypass  can  be  used  to  treat 
chronic femoropopliteal vein obstruction. Long-term patency rates 
for venous bypass procedures generally exceed 60% and are asso-
ciated with improvement in symptoms. Surgical reconstruction of 
the valves of the deep veins and valve transfer procedures are used 
to  treat  valvular  incompetence.  Valvuloplasty  involves  tightening 

the  valve  by  commissural  apposition.  With  valve  transfer  proce-
dures, a segment of vein with a competent valve, such as a brachial 
or  axillary  vein,  or  adjacent  saphenous  or  deep  femoral  vein,  is 
inserted  as  an  interposition  graft  in  the  incompetent  vein.  Both 
valvuloplasty and vein transfer operations result in ulcer healing in 
the majority of patients, although success rates are somewhat better 
with valvuloplasty.

Lymphedema  Lymphedema  is  a  chronic  condition  caused  by 
impaired transport of lymph and characterized by swelling of one or 
more  limbs  and  occasionally  the  trunk  and  genitalia.  Fluid  accumu-
lates in interstitial tissues when there is an imbalance between lymph 
production and lymph absorption, a process governed in large part by 
Starling forces. Deficiency, reflux, or obstruction of lymph vessels per-
turbs the ability of the lymphatic system to reabsorb proteins that had 
been  filtered  by  blood  vessels,  and  the  tissue  osmotic  load  promotes 
interstitial  accumulation  of  water.  Persistent  lymphedema  leads  to 
inflammatory  and  immune  responses  characterized  by  infiltration  of 
mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, and adipocytes, leading to adipose and 
collagen deposition in the skin and subcutaneous tissues.

Lymphatic Anatomy  Lymphatic capillaries are blind-ended tubes 
formed by a single layer of endothelial cells. The absent or widely fen-
estrated basement membrane of lymphatic capillaries allows access to 
interstitial proteins and particles. Lymphatic capillaries merge to form 
microlymphatic precollector vessels, which contain few smooth muscle 
cells.  The  precollector  vessels  drain  into  collecting  lymphatic  vessels, 
which comprise endothelial cells, a basement membrane, smooth mus-
cle, and bileaflet valves. The collecting lymphatic vessels in turn merge 
to form larger lymphatic conduits. Analogous to venous anatomy, there 
are superficial and deep lymphatic vessels in the legs, which communi-
cate at the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes. Pelvic lymphatic vessels 
drain into the thoracic duct, which ascends from the abdomen to the 
thorax and connects with the left brachiocephalic vein. Lymph is pro-
pelled centrally by the phasic contractile activity of lymphatic smooth 
muscle and facilitated by the contractions of contiguous skeletal mus-
cle. The presence of lymphatic valves ensures unidirectional flow.

Etiology  Lymphedema may be categorized as primary or second-
ary  (Table  282-2).  The  prevalence  of  primary  lymphedema  is  ~1.15 
per 100,000 persons <20 years of age. Females are affected more fre-
quently than males. Primary lymphedema may be caused by agenesis, 
hypoplasia, hyperplasia, or obstruction of the lymphatic vessels. There 
are  three  clinical  subtypes:  congenital  lymphedema,  which  appears 
shortly  after  birth;  lymphedema  praecox,  which  has  its  onset  at  the 
time  of  puberty;  and  lymphedema  tarda,  which  usually  begins  after 
age  35.  Familial  forms  of  congenital  lymphedema  (Milroy’s  disease) 
and  lymphedema  praecox  (Meige’s  disease)  may  be  inherited  in  an 
autosomal  dominant  manner  with  variable  penetrance;  autosomal 
or sex-linked recessive forms are less common. At least 19 genes are 
associated  with  inherited  forms  of  lymphedema.  Mutations  in  genes 
expressing  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  receptor  3  (VEGFR3), 
which is a determinant of lymphangiogenesis, cause Milroy’s disease; 
and a mutation of the gene encoding VEGF-C, a ligand for VEGFR3, 
may  cause  a  Milroy’s  disease-like  phenotype.  A  mutation  of  the 
LSC1  gene  is  associated  with  the  cholestasis-lymphedema  syndrome. 
Mutations  in  the  FOXC2  gene,  which  encodes  a  transcription  factor 
that  interacts  with  a  signaling  pathway  involved  in  the  development 
of  lymphatic  vessels,  cause  the  lymphedema-distichiasis  syndrome, 
in  which  lymphedema  praecox  occurs  in  patients  who  also  have 
a  double  row  of  eyelashes.  A  mutation  of  SOX18,  a  transcrip-
tion  factor  upstream  of  lymphatic  endothelial  cell  differentiation, 
has  been  described  in  patients  with  lymphedema,  alopecia,  and 
telangiectasias (hypotrichosis, lymphedema, telangiectasia syndrome). 
Mutations  of  the  CCBE1  gene,  which  enhances  the  lymphangio-
genic  effects  of  VEGF-C,  cause  Hennekam’s  lymphangiectasia- 
lymphedema  syndrome,  and  KIF11  gene  mutations  are  associated 
with  microcephaly-lymphedema  syndrome.  Mutations  of  the  GATA2 
gene, which is involved in the development of lymphatic valves, cause

lymphedema  and  a  predisposition  to  acute  myeloid  leukemia.  Patients 
with a chromosomal aneuploidy, such as Turner’s syndrome, Klinefelter’s 
syndrome, or trisomy 18, 13, or 21, may develop lymphedema. Syndromic 
vascular  anomalies  associated  with  lymphedema  also  include  Klippel- 
Trénaunay  syndrome  and  Parkes-Weber  syndrome.  Other  disorders 
associated  with  lymphedema  include  Noonan’s  syndrome,  yellow  nail 
syndrome, intestinal lymphangiectasia syndrome, lymphangiomyomato-
sis, and neurofibromatosis type 1.

Secondary lymphedema is an acquired condition that results from 
damage  to  or  obstruction  of  previously  normal  lymphatic  channels. 
Recurrent episodes of bacterial lymphangitis, usually caused by strep-
tococci, are a very common cause of lymphedema. The most common 
etiology  of  secondary  lymphedema  worldwide  is  lymphatic  filariasis, 
affecting  >120  million  children  and  adults  and  causing  lymphedema 
and elephantiasis in 14 million of these affected individuals (Chap. 233).  
Recurrent bacterial lymphangitis by Streptococcus may result in chronic

lymphedema.  Other  infectious  causes  include  lymphogranuloma 
venereum and tuberculosis. A common acquired cause of lymphedema 
in  tropical  countries  is  podoconiosis,  which  results  from  barefoot 
exposure  and  absorption  of  silicate  particles  in  soil  derived  from 
volcanic  rock.  In  developed  countries,  the  most  common  secondary 
cause of lymphedema is surgical excision or irradiation of axillary and 
inguinal lymph nodes for treatment of cancers, such as breast, cervical, 
endometrial, and prostate cancer, sarcomas, and malignant melanoma. 
Lymphedema of the arm occurs in 13% of breast cancer patients after 
axillary node dissection and in 22% after both surgery and radiother-
apy. Lymphedema of the leg affects ~15% of patients with cancer after 
inguinal lymph node dissection. Tumors, such as prostate cancer and 
lymphoma,  also  can  infiltrate  and  obstruct  lymphatic  vessels.  Less 
common causes include contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, preg-
nancy, and self-induced or factitious lymphedema after application of 
tourniquets.

Clinical Presentation  Lymphedema is generally a painless condition, 
but  patients  may  experience  a  chronic  dull,  heavy  sensation  in  the 
leg,  and  most  often,  they  are  concerned  about  the  appearance  of  the 
leg.  Lymphedema  of  the  lower  extremity  initially  involves  the  foot 
and  gradually  progresses  up  the  leg  so  that  the  entire  limb  becomes 
edematous (Fig. 282-2). In the early stages, the edema is soft and pits 
easily with pressure. Over time, subcutaneous adipose tissue accumu-
lates, the limb enlarges further and loses its normal contour, and the 
toes  appear  square.  Thickening  of  the  skin  is  detected  by  Stemmer’s 
sign, which is the inability to tent the skin at the base of the toes. Peau 
d’orange  is  a  term  used  to  describe  dimpling  of  the  skin,  resembling 
that  of  an  orange  peel,  caused  by  lymphedema.  In  the  chronic 
stages,  the  edema  no  longer  pits  and  the  limb  acquires  a  woody 
texture as the tissues become indurated and fibrotic. The International 
Society  of  Lymphology  describes  four  clinical  stages  of  lymphedema  
(Table 282-3).

Differential  Diagnosis  Lymphedema  should  be  distinguished 
from  other  disorders  that  cause  unilateral  leg  swelling,  such  as 
deep-vein  thrombosis  and  chronic  venous  insufficiency.  In  the  latter 
condition, the edema is softer, and there is often evidence of a stasis

TABLE 282-3  Stages of Lymphedema
Stage 0 (or Ia)

A latent or subclinical condition where swelling is not evident despite impaired 
lymph transport. It may exist for months or years before overt edema occurs.

Stage I

Early accumulation of fluid relatively high in protein content that subsides with 
limb elevation. Pitting may occur. An increase in proliferating cells may also be 
seen.

Stage II

Limb elevation alone rarely reduces tissue swelling, and pitting is manifest. Late 
in stage II, the limb may or may not pit as excess fat and fibrosis supervene.

Stage III

Lymphostatic elephantiasis where pitting can be absent and trophic skin 
changes such as acanthosis, further deposition of fat and fibrosis, and warty 
overgrowths have developed.

dermatitis,  hyperpigmentation,  and  superficial  venous  varicosities, 
as  described  earlier.  Other  causes  of  leg  swelling  that  resemble 
lymphedema are myxedema and lipedema. Lipedema usually occurs in 
women and is caused by accumulation of adipose tissue in the leg from 
the thigh to the ankle with sparing of the feet.

Diagnostic Testing  The evaluation of patients with lymphedema 
should  include  diagnostic  studies  to  clarify  the  cause.  Abdominal 
and  pelvic  ultrasound  and  computed  tomography  (CT)  can  be  used 
to  detect  obstructing  lesions  such  as  neoplasms.  Magnetic  resonance 
imaging  (MRI)  of  the  affected  limb  may  reveal  a  honeycomb  pat-
tern  characteristic  of  lymphedema  in  the  epifascial  compartment 
and  identify  enlarged  lymphatic  channels  and  lymph  nodes.  MRI 
also  is  useful  to  distinguish  lymphedema  from  lipedema.  Lympho-
scintigraphy  and  lymphangiography  are  rarely  indicated,  but  either 
can  be  used  to  confirm  the  diagnosis  or  differentiate  primary  from 
secondary  lymphedema.  Lymphoscintigraphy  involves  the  injection 
of  radioactively  labeled  technetium-containing  colloid  into  the  distal 
subcutaneous tissue of the affected extremity, which is imaged with a 
scintigraphic camera to visualize lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. 
Findings indicative of primary lymphedema include absent or delayed 
filling of the lymphatic vessels or dermal back flow caused by lymphatic 
reflux. Findings of secondary lymphedema include dilated lymphatic 
vessels distal to an area of obstruction. In lymphangiography, iodinated 
radiocontrast  material  is  injected  into  a  distal  lymphatic  vessel  that 
has been isolated and cannulated. In primary lymphedema, lymphatic 
channels are absent, hypoplastic, or ectatic. In secondary lymphedema, 
lymphatic channels often appear dilated beneath the level of obstruc-
tion.  The  complexities  of  lymphatic  cannulation  and  the  risk  of 
lymphangitis  associated  with  the  contrast  agent  limit  the  utility  of 
lymphangiography. Optical imaging with a near-infrared fluorescence 
dye may enable quantitative imaging of lymph flow.

TREATMENT
Lymphedema

Patients  with  lymphedema  of  the  lower  extremities  must  be 
instructed to take meticulous care of their feet and legs to prevent 
cellulitis  and  lymphangitis.  Skin  hygiene  is  important,  and  emol-
lients  can  be  used  to  prevent  drying.  Prophylactic  antibiotics  are 
often  helpful,  and  fungal  infection  should  be  treated  aggressively. 
Patients  should  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  physical  activity; 
frequent  leg  elevation  can  reduce  the  amount  of  edema.  Psycho-
social  support  is  indicated  to  assist  patients  cope  with  anxiety  or 

depression related to body image, self-esteem, functional disability, 
and fear of limb loss.

Physical therapy, including massage to facilitate lymphatic drain-
age, may be helpful. The type of massage used in decongestive phys-
iotherapy for lymphedema involves mild compression of the skin of 
the affected extremity to dilate the lymphatic channels and enhance 
lymphatic motility. Multilayered, compressive bandages are applied 
after each massage session to reduce recurrent edema. After optimal 
reduction in limb volume by decongestive physiotherapy, patients 
can be fitted with graduated compression hose. Occasionally, inter-
mittent  pneumatic  compression  devices  can  be  applied  at  home  to 
facilitate  reduction  of  the  edema.  Diuretics  are  contraindicated 
and  may  cause  depletion  of  intravascular  volume  and  metabolic 
abnormalities.

Liposuction  in  conjunction  with  decongestive  physiotherapy 
may be considered to treat lymphedema, particularly postmastec-
tomy lymphedema. Other surgical interventions are rarely used and 
often  not  successful  in  ameliorating  lymphedema.  Microsurgical 
lymphaticovenous anastomotic procedures have been performed to 
rechannel  lymph  flow  from  obstructed  lymphatic  vessels  into  the 
venous system. Limb reduction procedures to resect subcutaneous 
tissue and excessive skin are performed occasionally in severe cases 
of lymphedema to improve mobility.

Therapeutic lymphangiogenesis has been studied in rodent mod-
els  of  lymphedema.  Overexpression  of  VEGF-C  generates  new 
lymphatic vessels and improves lymphedema in a murine model of 
primary lymphedema, and administration of recombinant VEGF-C 
or VEGF-D stimulated lymphatic growth in preclinical models of 
postsurgical  lymphedema.  There  may  be  additional  benefit  when 
administered in conjunction with lymph node transfer. Clinical tri-
als in patients with lymphedema are required to determine efficacy 
of gene transfer and cell-based therapies for lymphedema.

PART 6Disorders of the Cardiovascular System283 Pulmonary Hypertension

Bradley A. Maron, Joseph Loscalzo

Pulmonary  hypertension  (PH)  is  a  heterogenous  disease  involving 
pathogenic remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, which increases 
pulmonary artery pressure and vascular resistance. The most common 
causes of PH are left heart or primary lung disease; PH is also observed 
in some patients as a late complication of luminal pulmonary embo-
lism.  Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  is  an  uncommon,  but 
distinct, PH subtype characterized by the interplay between molecular 
and  genetic  events  that  cause  an  obliterative  arteriopathy  and  symp-
toms of dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope. If left untreated, PH carries a 
high mortality rate, largely owing to decompensated right heart failure.
There  have  been  significant  advances  in  the  field  with  regard  to 
understanding  disease  pathogenesis,  diagnosis,  and  classification. 
For  example,  the  mean  pulmonary  artery  pressure  (mPAP)  used  to 
diagnose PH has been lowered from ≥25 mmHg to >20 mmHg. This 
adjustment emphasizes earlier detection of PH, as a substantial delay in 
diagnosis of up to 2 years is common and has important implications 
for both quality of life and life span. Clinicians should be able to rec-
ognize the signs and symptoms of PH and complete a systematic eval-
uation  in  at-risk  patients.  In  this  way,  prompt  diagnosis,  appropriate 
treatment, and optimized patient outcome are achievable.
 ■ PATHOBIOLOGY
Apoptosis resistance, cell proliferation, dysregulated metabolism, and 
increased oxidant stress involving pulmonary vascular cells and adven-
titial fibroblasts underlie the pathogenesis of PAH. These events lead to 

hypertrophic, fibrotic, and plexogenic remodeling of distal (small) pul-
monary arterioles, which decreases vascular compliance and promotes 
in situ thrombosis (Fig. 283-1). A minority of patients appear to have 
a vasoconstriction-dominant phenotype, which, if present, requires a 
unique treatment strategy discussed in greater detail below.

Abnormalities in multiple molecular pathways and genes that reg-
ulate  pulmonary  vascular  endothelial  and  smooth  muscle  cells  have 
been identified (Table 283-1). These abnormalities include decreased 
expression  of  the  voltage-regulated  potassium  channel,  mutations  in 
the  bone  morphogenetic  protein  receptor-2,  increased  tissue  factor 
expression,  overactivation  of  the  serotonin  transporter,  hypoxia- 
induced  activation  of  hypoxia-inducible  factor-1α,  and  activation  of 
nuclear factor of activated T cells. Recently, overlap in the pathobiology 
of PAH with solid tumor cancers has been recognized, leading to the 
identification of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and neural precursor 
cell  expressed  developmentally  downregulated  9  (NEDD9)  as  impor-
tant in PAH. Thrombin deposition in the pulmonary vasculature that 
develops as an independent abnormality or as a result of endothelial 
dysfunction may amplify the obliterative arteriopathy.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
In  PAH,  pathologic  changes  to  pulmonary  arterial  compliance  result 
in a progressive increase in total pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). 
The resting PVR increases through the temporal progression of PAH, 
corresponding to a rise in mPAP. To preserve cardiac output (CO) in the 
face of elevated right ventricular afterload, right ventricular work must 
increase. A sustained (or progressive) increase in right ventricular work 
causes a shift in the efficiency of right ventricular systolic function by 
which maintaining pulmonary circulatory pressure depletes myocardial 
energy. These changes occur at the expense of energy normally reserved 
to  maintain  optimal  blood  perfusion  through  the  alveolar-capillary

interface  for  blood  oxygenation,  a  process  termed  right  ventricular–
pulmonary  arterial  uncoupling.  In  end-stage  PAH,  the  CO  declines, 
leading  to  a  decrease  in  mPAP  (Fig.  283-2),  and  extrapulmonary 
vascular  manifestations  are  frequent;  these  include  overactivation  of 
neurohumoral  signaling,  renal  failure,  and  volitional  muscle  atrophy, 
which is likely due to deconditioning (Fig. 283-3).
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The  diagnosis  of  PH  can  be  missed  without  a  reasonable  index  of 
suspicion. Indeed, findings from clinical registries suggest that PH is 
often  overlooked,  even  among  patients  with  numerous  risk  factors. 
This shortcoming may be because PH symptoms are nonspecific, insid-
ious, and overlap considerably with many common conditions, such as 
asthma or left heart failure. Additionally, there is a misconception that 
in patients with comorbid cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., intersti-
tial lung disease, mitral valve disease), PH is merely an extension of the 
underlying disease rather than a specific clinical entity.

Most  patients  will  present  with  dyspnea  and/or  fatigue,  whereas 
edema,  chest  pain,  presyncope,  and  syncope  are  less  common  and 
associated  with  more  advanced  disease.  In  early  phases  of  PAH,  the 
physical  examination  is  often  unrevealing.  As  the  disease  progresses, 
there may be evidence of right ventricular failure with elevated jugular 
venous pressure, lower extremity edema, and ascites. Additionally, the 
cardiovascular examination may reveal an accentuated P2 component 
of  the  second  heart  sound,  a  right-sided  S3  or  S4,  and  a  holosystolic 
tricuspid regurgitant murmur. It is also important to seek signs of the 
diseases that are commonly concurrent with PH: clubbing may be seen 
in  some  chronic  lung  diseases,  sclerodactyly  and  telangiectasia  may 
signify scleroderma (or the limited cutaneous form, CREST [calcinosis, 
Raynaud’s  phenomenon,  esophageal  dysmotility,  sclerodactyly,  and 
telangiectasia]), and crackles on examination of the lungs and systemic 
hypertension may be clues to left-sided systolic or diastolic heart failure.
Overview of the Diagnostic Clinical Evaluation  Once clinical 
suspicion  is  raised,  a  systematic  approach  to  diagnosis  and  assess-
ment  is  essential.  In  advanced  disease,  electrocardiography  may  show 
right  ventricular  hypertrophy  or  strain,  and  enlargement  of  pul-
monary  arteries  and  obliteration  of  the  retrosternal  space  is  often 
observed on chest roentgenography (Fig. 283-4). In turn, echocardiog-
raphy  with  agitated  saline  (bubble)  study  is  the  most  important  initial 
screening  test.  Elevated  estimated  pulmonary  artery  systolic  pressure  
(>35 mmHg) or a hypertrophied or dilated right ventricle support the 
diagnosis of PH. Important additional information can be gleaned about 
specific etiologies of PH, such as valvular disease, left ventricular systolic 
and diastolic function, left atrial enlargement, and intracardiac shunt.

A high-quality echocardiogram that is absolutely normal may obvi-
ate the need for further PH evaluation. However, this is distinct from 
an echocardiogram in which tricuspid regurgitation is not detected. In 
this scenario, the information required to estimate pulmonary artery 
pressure is lacking, and PH is observed in one-third of such patients. 
Patients with evidence of PH on echocardiography or in whom unex-
plained  dyspnea  or  hypoxemia  is  evident  despite  an  unremarkable 
echocardiogram often require further assessment.

Additional tests focusing on functional capacity are useful for quanti-
fying disease burden, such as a 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) assess-
ment, which also aids in assessing prognosis. Cardiopulmonary exercise 
testing (CPET) differentiates between cardiac and pulmonary causes of 
dyspnea and includes measuring peak volume of oxygen consumption, 
which  is  an  integrated  parameter  of  cardiopulmonary  fitness  and  also 
useful  in  prognosticating  PH.  In  patients  with  a  normal  CPET,  further 
invasive testing is often unnecessary. One exception to this approach is in 
patients with reassuring CPET results but in whom a significant decrease 
in exercise tolerance from baseline is nonetheless reported, often observed 
in elite athletes or highly conditioned individuals with early-stage PH.

Invasive hemodynamic monitoring with right heart catheterization 
(RHC) is the gold standard for PH diagnosis and severity assessment. 
Interpretation of RHC data, however, is often optimized by informa-
tion from diagnostic tests that support and frame the clinical context 
of pulmonary vascular disease.

FIGURE 283-2  An integrated overview of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In PAH, initial changes in the histopathophenotype of distal pulmonary arterioles precedes 
significant changes in hemodynamics or the development of symptoms in most patients (clinical stage A). As vascular remodeling progresses, there is an increase in 
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and right atrial pressure (RAP). In clinical stage B, symptoms are evident and, when diagnosed, 
prompt  early,  aggressive  treatment.  Effacement  of  pulmonary  arterioles  results  in  severely  increased  PVR  that  promotes  right  heart  failure,  defined  by  a  decrease  in 
cardiac output (CO) and PAP. Patients in clinical stage C have severe symptoms and require full therapeutic intervention. Identifying clinical stage A patients remains 
challenging, although genetic risk factors or symptoms with exercise may be informative. EC, endothelial cell; SMC, smooth muscle cell. (Reprinted with permission of the

FIGURE  283-3  Systemic  manifestations  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH).  
In PAH, the vasculopathy is severe and increases pulmonary vascular resistance. 
This  promotes  right  ventricular–pulmonary  arterial  uncoupling,  which  describes 
inefficient  work  and  energy  expenditure  by  the  right  ventricle.  Systemic 
manifestations,  which  are  likely  secondary  to  changes  in  cardiopulmonary 
hemodynamics, include overactivation of neurohumoral signaling, chronic kidney 
disease, increased bioactive sex hormones, and volitional muscle atrophy. RV-PA, 
right ventricular–pulmonary arterial.

Stepwise  Approach  to  Diagnosing  PH  One  common  PH 
diagnostic  strategy  is  outlined  below;  however,  the  approach  should 
be individualized in practice according to a particular patient’s clinical 
and risk factor profile. For example, patients with a strong history of 
inhaled  tobacco  use  may  benefit  from  prioritizing  diagnostic  tests 
assessing  pulmonary  function  and  the  lung  parenchyma,  whereas  a 
myocardial ischemia evaluation should be considered early in the eval-
uation of patients with left-sided cardiomyopathy.

PULMONARY  FUNCTION  AND  LUNG  IMAGING  Pulmonary  function 
testing  results  may  suggest  restrictive  or  obstructive  lung  diseases  as 
the cause of dyspnea or PH. In PAH, an isolated reduction in diffusing 
capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DlCO) is a classic finding. 
High-resolution  computed  tomography  (CT)  provides  useful  infor-
mation, particularly enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, right 
ventricle, and atria, as well as peripheral pruning of small vessels; how-
ever, high-resolution CT may also reveal signs of venous congestion, 
including  centrilobular  ground  glass  infiltrate  and  thickened  septa. 
In the absence of left heart disease, these findings suggest pulmonary 
venous disease, a rare cause of PAH that can be quite challenging to 
diagnose.  CT  is  also  critical  for  distinguishing  co-morbid  interstitial 
lung  disease,  emphysema,  or  overlap  syndromes  that  include  fibrosis 
and obstructive pulmonary disease.

SLEEP STUDIES  Nocturnal desaturation is a common finding in PH, 
even  in  the  absence  of  sleep-disordered  breathing.  Thus,  all  patients 
should  undergo  nocturnal  oximetry  screening,  regardless  of  whether 
classic symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea or obesity-hypoventilation 
syndrome are present.
ASSESSMENT  OF  PULMONARY  ARTERIAL  THROMBOSIS  Patients  with 
prior  luminal  pulmonary  embolism  are  at  increased  risk  for  chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which is a specific 
PH subtype characterized by vascular fibrosis and arterial microthrom-
bus.  Although  CTEPH  is  curable  in  many  patients  by  surgical  endart-
.
.  
erectomy, it is also widely underdiagnosed. Ventilation-perfusion (V
 ) 
/Q
scanning is the primary test used to screen and diagnose CTEPH, which 
should be considered in any patient with PH of unclear etiology. The role 
of  CT  angiography  in  the  diagnosis  and  management  of  CTEPH  con-
tinues to evolve. At present, CT angiography is commonly used to stage 
anatomic  thromboembolic  burden,  which  may  be  ultimately  necessary 
to  determine  operative  candidacy.  The  definitive  diagnostic  procedure 
remains  pulmonary  angiography  since  contrast  enhancement  in  this 
study provides detailed information on webbing, stricture, and vascular 
tapering patterns pathognomonic for CTEPH.

SEROLOGY  Laboratory  data  that  are  important  for  screening  include 
a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test when clinically indicated. 
In  addition,  all  patients  should  have  antinuclear  antibodies,  rheuma-
toid  factor,  and  anti-Scl-70  antibodies  assessed  to  screen  for  the  most 
common  rheumatologic  diseases  associated  with  PH.  Liver  function 
and  hepatitis  serology  tests  are  important  to  screen  for  underlying 
liver  disease.  Methamphetamine  use  is  recognized  increasingly  as  a 
cause  of  PAH,  and  screening  should  be  considered  in  patients  from 
endemic regions or in whom the cause of PAH is not otherwise estab-
lished.  Finally,  brain  natriuretic  peptide  (BNP)  and  the  N-terminus 
of  its  pro-peptide  (NT-proBNP)  correlate  with  right  ventricular  (dys)
function, hemodynamic severity, and functional status in PAH. Medical 
therapy  also  lowers  NT-proBNP  levels  in  PAH,  and  therefore  this  test 
may be used as a biomarker for assessing treatment response in clinical  
practice.

INVASIVE  CARDIOPULMONARY  HEMODYNAMICS  The  RHC  remains 
the gold standard test to both establish the diagnosis of PH and guide 
selection  of  appropriate  medical  therapy.  The  hemodynamic  criteria 
for  diagnosing  PH  requires,  first,  an  mPAP  >20  mmHg.  Precapillary 
and  postcapillary  PH  are  then  distinguished  by  virtue  of  a  pulmo-
nary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) (or left ventricular end-diastolic 
pressure  [LVEDP])  ≤15  mmHg  or  >15  mmHg,  respectively.  Isolated 
precapillary PH also requires a PVR ≥3.0 Wood units (WU), whereas 
isolated  postcapillary  PH  is  defined  by  PVR  <3.0  WU.  Increasingly, 
combined pre- and postcapillary PH is recognized, defined by elevated 
mPAP >20 mmHg, PVR ≥3.0 WU, and PAWP >15 mmHg (Fig. 283-5).
These hemodynamic profiles inform PH clinical categorization. For 
example, isolated precapillary PH is most often due to primary lung dis-
ease, PAH, or CTEPH. Isolated postcapillary PH occurs in patients with 
mitral valvular disease, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or heart fail-
ure with preserved ejection faction. The same etiologies for isolated post-
capillary PH also underlie combined pre- and postcapillary PH. When 
present, this indicates that chronic vascular congestion due to left atrial 
hypertension has resulted in substantial pulmonary vascular remodeling.
Vasoreactivity  testing  should  be  reserved  mainly  for  patients  with 
idiopathic  or  hereditary  PAH.  Vasodilators  with  a  short  duration  of 
action, such as inhaled nitric oxide (NO•) or inhaled epoprostenol, are 
preferred for testing. A decrease in mPAP by ≥10 mmHg to an abso-
lute level ≤40 mmHg without a decrease in CO is defined as a positive 
pulmonary vasodilator response, and such responders are considered 
for long-term treatment with calcium channel blockers. Less than 5% 
of patients are deemed vasoreactive, although prognosis among these 
patients is particularly favorable.
 ■ PULMONARY HYPERTENSION CLASSIFICATION
In 1998, a PH clinical classification schema was formulated, of which 
PAH  (formerly  primary  pulmonary  hypertension)  is  a  subgroup, 
according to similarities in pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical 
presentation. The categorization of PH at that time and currently exists 
for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  novel  treatments  to  be  tested  among 
different  presentations  (Fig.  283-6).  Efforts  are  underway  to  define

FIGURE 283-6  Strategy for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension (PH) in clinical practice. A high index of clinical suspicion for PH is raised based on clinical features, 
symptoms,  and  findings  on  transthoracic  echocardiography  (ECHO).  The  prevalence  of  PH  is  elevated  in  primary  lung  or  cardiovascular  disease;  therefore,  an  initial 
assessment should be geared toward diagnosing these comorbidities. This may include emphasis on cardiovascular risk factors, pulmonary function testing (PFT), and/or 
high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. The diagnosis of PH and assessment of disease severity are determined by findings on right heart catheterization 
(RHC). Classification of PH subtype hinges on hemodynamic parameters and clinical features. Group 2 PH may be evident with PVR <3.0 WU, as detailed in Fig. 283-5. CTA,

2126 pulmonary vascular diseases based on molecular phenotyping that, in 
the future, may offer a guide for improved management decisions as 
precision medicine strategies continue to evolve.

The  current  classification  system,  last  revised  in  2018  during  the 
Sixth World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension, recognizes five 
PH categories listed here sequentially as groups 1–5: PAH; PH due to 
left heart disease; PH due to chronic lung disease or sleep-disordered 
breathing; CTEPH; and a group of miscellaneous diseases that rarely 
(or inconsistently) cause PH.

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension  WHO group 1 PH, or PAH, 
involves  marked  pulmonary  arterial  precapillary  remodeling,  includ-
ing intimal fibrosis, increased medial thickness, pulmonary arteriolar 
occlusion, and classic plexiform lesions. The hemodynamic criteria for 
PAH are sustained elevation in resting mPAP >20 mmHg, PVR ≥3.0 
WU, and PAWP or LVEDP of ≤15 mmHg based on RHC. Idiopathic 
PAH (IPAH) is a progressive disease that leads to right heart failure and 
early mortality. From the original National Institutes of Health registry 
on IPAH in 1987, the average age at diagnosis was 36 years, with only 
9% of patients with IPAH over the age of 60. However, contemporary 
data now inclusive of numerous international registries suggest a dif-
ferent clinical profile. The mean age of PAH patients is reported to be 
54–68 years old across studies. This reflects, in part, rising awareness 
of this disease in the elderly. The prevalence of IPAH favors women to 
men by ~3.1-fold; however, the hemodynamics at diagnosis are more 
severe, and the prognosis is less favorable in men compared to women.

Diseases Associated with PAH  Other forms of PAH that deserve 
specific  consideration  are  those  associated  with  congenital  heart  dis-
ease  with  intracardiac  shunt,  connective  tissue  disease,  portal  hyper-
tension, and HIV.

CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE  PAH in the setting of congenital heart 
disease is important to recognize since surgical correction may be indi-
cated and when successful is associated with favorable prognosis. This 
is particular salient today, as more congenital heart disease patients live 
to adulthood and populate general medical practices. Still, referral to 
adult congenital heart disease centers should be considered for patients 
with  suspected  PAH,  which  in  this  population  is  subclassified  into 
four groups: Eisenmenger’s syndrome, systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, 
coincidental or small defects causing shunts, and postoperative/closed 
defects causing shunts. Surgical repair of congenital anatomic lesions 
may be indicated prior to elevation in PVR >3.0 WU to avoid the devel-
opment of Eisenmenger’s syndrome, a pathophysiologic consequence 
of progressive pulmonary vascular remodeling due to a large-volume 
left-to-right  shunt  that  is  associated  with  cyanosis,  hyperviscosity, 
weakness, and shortened life span.

CONNECTIVE  TISSUE  DISEASE  Patients  with  connective  tissue  
disease–associated  PAH  are  encountered  relatively  commonly  in 
clinical  practice.  Although  case  series  link  rheumatoid  arthritis  and 
systemic  lupus  erythematosus  with  pulmonary  vascular  disease,  the 
predominant clinical phenotype is systemic sclerosis-associated PAH. 
It  is  important  to  distinguish  patients  with  limited  cutaneous  scle-
roderma  from  those  with  diffuse  scleroderma  because  PH  in  the 
former is likely PAH and PH in the latter often occurs in the setting 
of  interstitial  lung  disease.  Although  the  average  age  of  scleroderma 
onset is between 30 and 50 years old, patients who eventually develop  
scleroderma-associated  PAH  tend  to  be  older  at  the  time  of  sclero-
derma diagnosis. The development of PAH in scleroderma is partic-
ularly worrisome prognostically, although implementation of modern 
therapies improves outcome.

PORTOPULMONARY HYPERTENSION  Among patients with established 
portal  hypertension,  2–10%  develop  portopulmonary  hypertension 
independent of the cause of liver disease. Furthermore, portopulmo-
nary  hypertension  is  observed  in  patients  with  nonhepatic  etiologies 
of portal hypertension. A hyperdynamic circulatory state is common, 
as  in  most  patients  with  advanced  liver  disease;  however,  the  same 
pulmonary  vascular  remodeling  observed  in  other  forms  of  PAH  is 
seen in the pulmonary vascular bed in portopulmonary hypertension. 

It  is  important  to  distinguish  this  process  from  hepatopulmonary 
syndrome, which can also manifest with dyspnea and hypoxemia but 
is  pathophysiologically  distinct  from  portopulmonary  hypertension 
in  that  abnormal  vasodilation  of  the  pulmonary  vasculature  leads  to 
intrapulmonary  shunting.  Portopulmonary  hypertension  is  an  estab-
lished marker of adverse outcome in the post–liver transplant period 
with 100% mortality reported in one study among patients with mPAP 
≥50 mmHg.
HIV-PAH  The  true  prevalence  of  HIV-PAH  is  not  known;  however, 
this  PAH  subtype  is  an  important  cause  of  mortality  in  the  HIV- 
infected population, and prognosis in these patients is among the least 
favorable  for  all  PH  subgroups.  There  is  no  correlation  between  the 
stage of HIV infection and the development of PAH.

Pulmonary  Hypertension  Associated  with  Left  Heart  
Disease  Patients  with  PH  due  to  left  ventricular  systolic  dysfunc-
tion, aortic and mitral valve disease, and heart failure with preserved 
ejection  fraction  (HFpEF)  are  classified  in  WHO  group  2.  The  hall-
mark of this PH phenotype is elevated left atrial pressure with resulting 
pulmonary venous hypertension. In left-sided systolic heart failure or 
HFpEF, even mildly elevated mPAP is associated with adverse clinical 
outcome. It should be noted that PH in the setting of mitral stenosis 
or  regurgitation  is  an  indication  for  surgical  (or  percutaneous)  valve 
intervention.

Regardless of the cause of elevated left atrial pressure, the increased 
pulmonary  venous  pressure  indirectly  leads  to  a  rise  in  pulmonary 
arterial  pressure.  Chronic  pulmonary  venous  hypertension  leading 
to  a  reactive  pulmonary  arterial  vasculopathy  is  considered  in  these 
patients  when  PVR  is  ≥3  WU.  Pathologically,  this  process  is  marked 
by pulmonary arteriolar remodeling with intimal fibrosis and medial 
hyperplasia  akin  to  that  seen  in  PAH,  as  well  as  pulmonary  venule 
sclerosis and thickening.

Pulmonary  Hypertension  Associated  with  Lung  Disease  
Intrinsic lung disease is the second most common cause of PH and has 
been observed in both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
and interstitial lung disease. Additionally, PH is also diagnosed in dis-
eases of mixed obstructive/restrictive pathophysiology: bronchiectasis, 
cystic fibrosis, mixed obstructive-restrictive disease marked by fibrosis 
in the lower lung zones, and emphysema predominantly in the upper 
lung zones. When associated with chronic lung disease, PH is usually 
modest. For example, 90% of COPD patients have mPAP >20 mmHg, 
but an mPAP >35 mmHg is observed in only 5% of patients. Nonethe-
less, the subgroup of patients with primary lung disease and severe PH 
is challenging clinically, as extensive pulmonary arterial involvement, 
very low DlCO on pulmonary function testing, and inhibition of nor-
mal vasoreactivity are observed and are associated with poor outcome. 
Sleep-disordered syndromes generally result in mild PH.

Pulmonary  Hypertension  Associated  with  Chronic  
Thromboembolic Disease  The development of PH after chronic 
thromboembolic  obstruction  of  the  pulmonary  arteries,  termed 
CTEPH, is well described. The incidence of CTEPH following a sin-
gle pulmonary embolic event is difficult to determine accurately, but 
probably is between 3 and 7% of patients. Importantly, 25% of patients 
with  CTEPH  have  no  history  of  clinical  venous  thromboembolism, 
suggesting  that  CTEPH  may  develop  following  a  subclinical  pulmo-
nary embolism or through a diverse range of mechanisms. Obstruction 
of  the  proximal  pulmonary  vasculature  due  to  webbing,  stricture,  or 
focal  fibrotic  occlusion  signifies  proximal  vessel  involvement.  Distal 
pulmonary  arterioles  remodel  by  luminal  narrowing  or  obliteration. 
Approximately 10–15% of patients will develop a disease very similar 
clinically  and  pathologically  to  PAH  after  resection  of  the  proximal 
thrombus (Fig. 283-7).

 ■ OTHER DISORDERS AFFECTING THE 
PULMONARY VASCULATURE
Sarcoidosis  Patients  with  sarcoidosis  can  develop  PH  as  a  result 
of lung involvement, and those who present with progressive dyspnea

and  PH  require  a  thorough  evaluation.  In  sarcoidosis,  PH  develops 
mainly due to granulomatous inflammation of the pulmonary vessels, 
although  mechanical  compression  of  pulmonary  arteries  by  enlarged 
lymph nodes is also reported.

Sickle  Cell  Disease  Cardiovascular  system  abnormalities  are 
prominent  in  the  clinical  spectrum  of  sickle  cell  disease  (and  other 
hemoglobinopathies), including PH, which occurs in 6–10% of patients. 
The etiology is multifactorial, including hemolysis, hypoxemia, throm-
boembolism, chronically high CO, and chronic liver disease.

Schistosomiasis  Globally,  schistosomiasis  is  among  the  most 
common causes of PH. The development of PH occurs in the setting 
of hepatosplenic disease and portal hypertension. Studies suggest that 
inflammation  from  the  infection  triggers  maladaptive  pulmonary 
vascular  changes.  The  diagnosis  is  confirmed  by  finding  the  parasite 
ova  in  the  urine  or  stool  of  patients  with  symptoms,  which  can  be 
difficult. The efficacy of therapies directed toward PH in these patients 
is unknown.

 ■ PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OF PAH
Prior to the availability of disease-specific therapy, the 1- and 3-year 
mortality  rates  for  IPAH  or  hereditary  PAH  were  68  and  48%, 
respectively.  In  the  current  era,  there  are  14  U.S.  Food  and  Drug 
Administration  (FDA)–approved  medical  therapies  for  PAH,  and 
standardized  treatment  strategies  have  been developed  that  empha-
size  early,  aggressive  pharmacotherapy  initiated  at  a  PH  specialty 
clinical center. Among optimally treated patients, the 1- and 3-year 
survival rates have improved to 91 and 69%, respectively. All medical 
therapies  target  the  prostacyclin,  NO•,  or  endothelin  receptor  sig-
naling pathways. Drug delivery methods now include oral, inhaled, 
subcutaneous (including via surgically implanted devices), and intra-
venous routes.

Prostanoids 
In  PAH,  endothelial  dysfunction  and  platelet  acti-
vation  cause  an  imbalance  of  arachidonic  acid  metabolites  with 
reduced  prostacyclin  levels  and  increased  thromboxane  A2  produc-
tion.  Prostacyclin  (PGI2)  activates  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate 
(cAMP)–dependent pathways that mediate vasodilation. PGI2 also has 
antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle and inhibits platelet 
aggregation.  Protein  levels  of  prostacyclin  synthase  are  decreased  in 
pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH. This imbalance of mediators 
is  offset  therapeutically  by  the  administration  of  either  exogenous 
prostacyclin  (and  analogues,  termed  prostanoids)  or  a  prostacyclin 
receptor agonist.

Epoprostenol was the first prostanoid available for the management 
of PAH. Epoprostenol delivered as a continuous intravenous infusion 
improves  functional  capacity  and  survival  in  PAH.  The  efficacy  of 

epoprostenol in WHO Functional Class (FC) III and IV PAH patients 
was  demonstrated  in  a  clinical  trial  that  showed  improved  quality  of 
life,  mPAP,  PVR,  6-MWD,  and  mortality.  Treprostinil  has  a  longer 
half-life  than  epoprostenol  (~4  h  vs  ~6  min),  which  allows  for  sub-
cutaneous  administration.  Treprostinil  has  been  shown  to  improve 
pulmonary hemodynamics, symptoms, exercise capacity, and survival 
in PAH. Inhaled prostacyclin provides the beneficial effects of infused 
prostacyclin  therapy  without  the  inconvenience  and  side  effects  of 
infusion  catheters  (e.g.,  risk  of  infection  and  infusion  site  reactions). 
Both inhaled iloprost and treprostinil have been approved for patients 
with PAH and severe heart failure symptoms. Oral prostacyclin is also 
efficacious in clinical trials, but the maximal dose is modest and, there-
fore, generally reserved as a second-line therapy.

Selexipag is an oral nonprostanoid diphenylpyrazine derivative that 
binds the prostaglandin I2 (IP) receptor with high affinity. The active 
metabolite  of  selexipag  has  a  prolonged  half-life  in  comparison  with 
prostanoid  analogues  and  permits  twice-daily  dosing.  The  efficacy 
of  selexipag  was  evaluated  in  patients  with  PAH  in  New  York  Heart 
Association (NYHA) FC II to III on background therapy with either 
an endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor antagonist or sildenafil, or both. This 
trial represents the largest randomized placebo-controlled trial among 
patients with PAH ever completed, enrolling 1156 patients treated for 
a median of 1.4 years. Selexipag reduced the risk of hospitalization and 
the risk of disease progression by 43% (p < .0001) compared to those 
who received placebo. There were no significant differences in mortal-
ity between the two study groups, and the side effect profile was similar 
to that of prostacyclins.

Endothelin Receptor Antagonists  Endothelin receptor antago-
nists (ERAs) inhibit the detrimental effects of ET-1, a potent endoge-
nous  vasoconstrictor  and  vascular  smooth  muscle  mitogen.  In  PAH, 
ET-1 associates positively with PVR and mPAP, and inversely with CO 
and 6-MWD. The ET-1 signaling axis is complex and cell type–specific: 
ET type A (ETA) and type B (ETB) receptors expressed in pulmonary 
artery smooth muscle cells mediate vasoconstriction, whereas human 
pulmonary artery endothelial cells express ETB receptors that promote 
ET-1 clearance and vasodilation through endothelial nitric oxide syn-
thase activation and prostacyclin release.

The three ERAs approved for use in the United States are the non-
selective ETA/B receptor antagonists bosentan and macitentan and the 
selective ETA antagonist ambrisentan. Studies have shown that bosen-
tan improves hemodynamics and exercise capacity and delays clinical 
worsening.  The  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  phase  3  Bosentan 
Randomized  Trial  of  Endothelin  Antagonist  Therapy  (BREATHE)-1 
trial  comparing  bosentan  to  placebo  demonstrated  improved  symp-
toms,  6-MWD,  and  WHO  FC  in  patients  treated  with  bosentan.

2128 Arterial  Hypertension  Patients  (EARLY)  study  comparing  bosentan 
to placebo demonstrated improved PVR and 6-MWD in patients with 
WHO FC II.

Several studies, including the phase 3, placebo-controlled Ambrisen-
tan in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, (ARIES)-1 trial, have demon-
strated  that  ambrisentan  improves  exercise  tolerance,  WHO  FC, 
hemodynamics, and quality of life in patients with PAH. More recently, 
the  Study  with  an  Endothelin  Receptor  Antagonist  in  Pulmonary 
Arterial  Hypertension  to  Improve  Clinical  Outcome  (SERAPHIN) 
trial randomized 742 PAH patients to receive placebo or macitentan, 
which is an ETA/B antagonist with optimized receptor binding affinity. 
The majority of patients were on some form of background PAH ther-
apy. Over an average treatment duration of 85 weeks, the hazard ratio 
for achieving the composite primary endpoint of PAH-related clinical 
worsening, which included death or disease progression, was decreased 
by 45% in the 10-mg dose arm.

Nitric Oxide Pathway Effectors  The gaseous, lipophilic molecule 
NO•  is  generated  by  endothelial  nitric  oxide  synthase  in  endothelial 
cells and activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) to generate cGMP in 
vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets. The cyclic nucleotide cGMP 
is  a  second  messenger  that  induces  vasodilation  through  relaxation  of 
arterial smooth muscle cells and inhibits platelet activation. Phosphodi-
esterase type 5 (PDE-5) enzymes are highly expressed in lung vascular 
tissue (and the corpus carvernosum of the penis). The PDE-5 inhibitors 
prevent hydrolysis (inactivation) of cGMP to maximize NO•-dependent 
vasodilation, serving as the basis for use of this drug class in the treat-
ment of PH (and erectile dysfunction). The two PDE-5 inhibitors used 
for the treatment of PAH are sildenafil and tadalafil. Both agents have 
been shown to improve hemodynamics and 6-MWD.

Riociguat increases bioactive cGMP by (1) stabilizing the molecular 
interaction  between  NO•  and  sGC,  and  (2)  directly  stimulating  sGC 
independent  of  NO•  bioavailability.  Riociguat  significantly  improved 
exercise  capacity,  pulmonary  hemodynamics,  WHO  FC,  and  time 
to  clinical  worsening  in  patients  with  PAH  and  is  the  sole  approved 
pharmacotherapy for CTEPH patients for whom surgical pulmonary 
endarterectomy is ineffective or contraindicated.

 ■ APPROACH TO PAH TREATMENT
The  approach  to  PAH  treatment  has  evolved  substantially  from  the 
prior era in which success was defined by delaying mortality in end-
stage disease. Now, treatment aims to achieve a low clinical risk profile, 
defined as a 1-year mortality risk of <5%. Generally, this describes a 
patient with minimal symptoms, WHO FC I or II, 6-WMD >440 m, 
and cardiac index ≥2.5 L/min per m2. To accomplish this goal, most 
patients will ultimately require two or more PAH pharmacotherapies 
in  addition  to  risk  factor  modification  (such  as  a  low-sodium  diet), 
diuretic  use,  supplemental  oxygen,  and  prescription  (or  supervised) 
exercise. Combination pharmacotherapy has a number of hypothetical 
advantages:  as  multiple  pathogenic  intermediaries  are  identified  and 
the  neoplastic  nature  of  PAH  is  recognized  increasingly,  it  is  clear 
that  targeting  the  diverse  pathobiologic  and  pathophysiologic  events 
involved in vascular remodeling is needed to optimize treatment. The 
concept of combination therapy in PAH is modeled after other com-
plex diseases in which a similar approach has been effective, including 
HIV, cancer, and heart failure.

The  role  of  early,  aggressive  therapy  with  combination  oral  treat-
ments was addressed in the landmark Initial Use of Ambrisentan plus 
Tadalafil  in  Pulmonary  Arterial  Hypertension  (AMBITION)  trial. 
Treatment-naïve,  incident  PAH  patients  (n  =  500)  were  randomized 
to  a  combination  of  ambrisentan  and  tadalafil,  ambrisentan  mono-
therapy, or tadalafil monotherapy. Up-front combination therapy with 
ambrisentan  and  tadalafil  was  associated  with  a  50%  lower  risk  of 
clinical worsening (composite of death, lung transplantation, hospital-
ization for PAH worsening, and worsening PAH) when compared with 
the monotherapy groups. This difference was driven primarily by the 
delay in time to first hospitalization. Importantly, initial combination 
therapy was not associated with an increase in adverse events. Registry 
data suggest that patients on dual therapy with a PDE-5 inhibitor plus

right  heart  catheterization.  Patients  with  a  positive  vasoreactivity  test  indicating 
an acute and robust vasodilatory response following administration of nitric oxide 
(or other approved pulmonary vasodilator) are treated with high-dose oral calcium 
channel  blocker  therapy  (Rx)  and  have  a  favorable  prognosis,  but  compose  a 
minority (<5%) of all PAH patients. Among patients with a negative vasoreactivity 
study, treatment selection is determined by clinical risk: high-risk patients, such as 
those with advanced heart failure or syncope, are treated with combination drug 
therapy, including intravenous prostacyclin therapy. Low- or intermediate (Int)-risk 
patients  are  initiated  on  combination  oral  therapy,  which  generally  includes  an 
endothelin receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. Subsequent 
add-on  therapy  (i.e.,  triple  therapy)  is  considered  in  patients  who  deteriorate 
clinically  or  fail  to  improve.  Lung  transplantation  or  other  surgical  strategies  are 
considered in patients with severe PAH refractory to maximal medical treatment.

ERA combinations alternative to the drugs studied in AMBITION also 
have better outcomes compared to patients treated with monotherapy, 
suggesting  that  the  attendant  benefit  from  combination  therapy  may 
not be drug-specific (Fig. 283-8).

The  paradigm  shift  toward  early,  aggressive  pharmacotherapy  in 
PAH  is  expanding  to  up-front  triple  combination  therapy.  Although 
limited  currently  to  smaller  prospective  studies  in  highly  selected 
patients, initiation of intravenous epoprostenol, bosentan, and silden-
afil in one report was associated with sustained clinical and hemody-
namic improvement and 100% survival at 3 years.

 ■ UNMET AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS IN 
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION
Despite substantial gains in quality of life and survival in PAH, ele-
vated patient mortality and limited quality of life remain at unaccept-
able levels. Improved awareness among clinicians and patients could 
lead to more timely diagnosis that will affect the response to therapy 
and  survival.  Patients  should  also  have  the  option  of  referral  to  a 
specialty center that focuses on treatment of patients with pulmonary 
vascular  disease,  which  will  ensure  their  access  to  state-of-the-art 
(multidisciplinary) care. Presently, only three classes of therapy exist 
for patients with PAH, and these do not reverse vascular remodeling 
sufficiently to provide a definitive long-term (>10 year) clinical bene-
fit. In addition, the role of currently available drugs in early-stage dis-
ease is not known and requires further investigation (Table 283-2). 
Treatments that address fibrosis and metabolic changes in pulmonary 
vascular  cells  are  needed.  Finally,  disease-specific  treatments  are 
lacking  for  PH  due  to  left  heart  disease  or  lung  disease.  Therefore, 
developing therapeutics for these large and vulnerable populations is 
of paramount importance.
