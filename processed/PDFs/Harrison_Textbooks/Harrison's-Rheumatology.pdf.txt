PART 11

Section 1  The Immune System in Health 
and Disease

349 Introduction to the 
Immune System
Barton F. Haynes, Kelly A. Soderberg, 
Anthony S. Fauci

 ■ DEFINITIONS
•	 Adaptive  immune  system—recently	 evolved	 system	 of	 immune	
responses	mediated	by	T	and	B	lymphocytes.	Immune	responses	by	
these	 cells	 are	 based	 on	 specific	 antigen	 recognition	 by	 clonotypic	
receptors	that	are	products	of	genes	that	rearrange	during	develop-
ment	and	throughout	the	life	of	the	organism.	Additional	cells	of	the	
adaptive	immune	system	include	various	types	of	antigen-presenting	
cells	(APCs).

•	 Antibody—B	cell–produced	molecules	encoded	by	genes	that	rear-
range	 during	 B-cell	 development	 consisting	 of	 immunoglobulin	
heavy	 and	 light	 chains	 that	 together	 form	 the	 central	 component	
of	 the	 B-cell	 receptor	 (BCR)	 for	 antigen.	 Antibody	 can	 exist	 as	 B	
cell–surface	antigen-recognition	molecules	or	as	secreted	molecules	
in	plasma	and	other	body	fluids.

•	 Antigens—foreign	or	self-molecules	that	are	recognized	by	the	adap-
tive	and	innate	immune	systems	resulting	in	immune	cell	triggering,	
T-cell	activation,	and/or	B-cell	antibody	production.

•	 Antimicrobial peptides—small	peptides	<100	amino	acids	in	length	
that	 are	 produced	 by	 cells	 of	 the	 innate	 immune	 system	 and	 have	
anti-infectious	agent	activity.

•	 Apoptosis—the	 process	 of	 programmed  cell  death	 whereby	 signal-
ing	through	various	“death	receptors”	on	the	surface	of	cells	(e.g.,	
tumor	necrosis	factor	[TNF]	receptors,	CD95)	leads	to	a	signaling	
cascade	that	involves	activation	of	the	caspase	family	of	molecules	
and	leads	to	DNA	cleavage	and	cell	death.	Apoptosis,	which	does	
not	 lead	 to	 induction	 of	 inordinate	 inflammation,	 is	 to	 be	 con-
trasted	with	cell necrosis,	which	does	lead	to	induction	of	inflam-
matory	responses.

•	 Autoimmune diseases—diseases	such	as	systemic	lupus	erythemato-
sus	and	rheumatoid	arthritis	in	which	cells	of	the	adaptive	immune	
system	such	as	autoreactive	T	and	B	cells	become	overreactive	and	
produce	self-reactive	T-cell	and	antibody	responses.

•	 Autoinflammatory diseases—hereditary	disorders	such	as	hereditary	
periodic	fevers	(HPFs)	characterized	by	recurrent	episodes	of	severe	
inflammation	and	fever	due	to	mutations	in	controls	of	the	innate	
inflammatory	 response,	 i.e.,	 the	 inflammasome	 (see	 below	 and	
Table	349-5).	Patients	with	HPFs	also	have	rashes,	serosal	and	joint	
inflammation,	 and	 some	 can	 have	 neurologic	 symptoms.	 Autoin-
flammatory	diseases	are	different	from	autoimmune	diseases	in	that	
evidence	for	activation	of	adaptive	immune	cells	such	as	autoreac-
tive	B	cells	is	not	present.

•	 Autophagy—lysosomal	degradation	pathway	mechanism	of	cells	to	
dispose	of	intracellular	debris	and	damaged	organelles.	Autophagy	
by	cells	of	the	innate	immune	system	is	used	to	control	intracellu-
lar	 infectious	 agents	 such	 as	 mycobacteria,	 in	 part	 by	 initiation	 of	
phagosome	 maturation	 and	 enhancing	 major	 histocompatibility	
complex	(MHC)	class	II	antigen	presentation	to	CD4	T	cells.

•	 B-cell  receptor  for  antigen—complex	 of	 surface	 molecules	 that	
rearrange	during	postnatal	B-cell	development,	made	up	of	surface	
immunoglobulin	 (Ig)	 and	 associated	 Ig	 αβ	 chain	 molecules	 that	
recognize	 nominal	 antigen	 via	 Ig	 heavy-	 and	 light-chain	 variable	

regions,	 and	 signal	 the	 B	 cell	 to	 terminally	 differentiate	 to	 make	
antigen-specific	antibody.

•	 B  lymphocytes—bone	 marrow–derived	 or	 bursal-equivalent	 lym-
phocytes	 that	 express	 surface	 immunoglobulin	 (the	 BCR	 for	 anti-
gen)	and	secrete	specific	antibody	after	interaction	with	antigen.
•	 B regulatory cells—a	population	of	suppressive	B	cells	that	aid	in	the	
inhibition	of	inflammation	through	the	release	of	cytokines	such	as	
interleukin	(IL)	10.

•	 CD classification of human lymphocyte differentiation antigens—the	
development	of	monoclonal	antibody	technology	led	to	the	discov-
ery	of	a	large	number	of	new	leukocyte	surface	molecules.	In	1982,	
the	 First	 International	 Workshop	 on	 Leukocyte	 Differentiation	
Antigens	was	held	to	establish	a	nomenclature	for	cell-surface	mol-
ecules	 of	 human	 leukocytes.	 From	 this	 and	 subsequent	 leukocyte	
differentiation	 workshops	 has	 come	 the	 cluster  of  differentiation	
(CD)	classification	of	leukocyte	antigens.

•	 CD4  T  cell—T	 lymphocyte	 subset	 that	 participates	 in	 adaptive	

immunity	and	helps	B	cells	make	antibody.

•	 CD8 T cell—cytotoxic	T	lymphocyte	subset	that	destroys	tumor	cells	

and	cells	infected	with	pathogens.

•	 Chemokines—soluble	molecules	that	direct	and	determine	immune	

cell	movement	and	circulation	pathways.

•	 Complement—cascading	 series	 of	 plasma	 enzymes	 and	 effector	
proteins	 that	 function	 to	 lyse	 pathogens	 and/or	 target	 them	 to	 be	
phagocytized	 by	 neutrophils	 and	 monocyte/macrophage	 lineage	
cells	of	the	reticuloendothelial	system.

•	 Co-stimulatory  molecules—molecules	 of	 APCs	 (such	 as	 B7-1	 and	
B7-2	or	CD40)	that	lead	to	T-cell	activation	when	bound	by	ligands	
on	activated	T	cells	(such	as	CD28	or	CD40	ligand).

•	 Crystallopathies—nanoparticle-	 or	 microparticle-sized	 deposits	 of	
crystals,	misfolded	proteins,	or	airborne	particulate	matter	that	can	
stimulate	 the	 inflammasome	 and	 initiate	 inflammation	 and	 tissue	
damage.

•	 Cytokines—soluble	proteins	that	interact	with	specific	cellular	recep-
tors	that	are	involved	in	the	regulation	of	the	growth	and	activation	
of	 immune	 cells	 and	 mediate	 normal	 or	 pathologic	 inflammatory	
and	immune	responses.

•	 Dendritic  cells—myeloid	 and/or	 lymphoid	 lineage	 APCs	 of	 the	
adaptive	 immune	 system.	 Immature	 dendritic	 cells	 (DCs),	 or	 DC	
precursors,	 are	 key	 components	 of	 the	 innate	 immune	 system	 by	
responding	to	infections	with	production	of	high	levels	of	cytokines.	
DCs	are	key	initiators	both	of	innate	immune	responses	via	cytokine	
production	and	of	adaptive	immune	responses	via	presentation	of	
antigen	to	T	lymphocytes.

•	 Ig  Fc  receptors—receptors	 found	 on	 the	 surface	 of	 certain	 cells	
including	 B	 cells,	 natural	 killer	 (NK)	 cells,	 macrophages,	 neu-
trophils,	 and	 mast	 cells.	 Fc	 receptors	 bind	 to	 antibodies	 that	 have	
attached	to	invading	pathogen-infected	cells.	They	stimulate	cyto-
toxic	 cells	 to	 destroy	 microbe-infected	 cells	 through	 a	 mechanism	
known	as	antibody-dependent	cell-mediated	cytotoxicity	(ADCC).	
Examples	of	important	Fc	receptors	include	CD16	(FcγRIIIa),	CD23	
(FcεR),	CD32	(FcγRII),	CD64	(FcγRI),	and	CD89	(FcαR).

•	 Inflammasome—large	 cytoplasmic	 complexes	 of	 intracellular	 pro-
teins	that	link	the	sensing	of	microbial	products	and	cellular	stress	
to	 the	 proteolytic	 activation	 of	 IL-1β	 and	 IL-18	 inflammatory	
cytokines.	 Activation	 of	 molecules	 in	 the	 inflammasome	 is	 a	 key	
step	in	the	response	of	the	innate	immune	system	for	intracellular	
recognition	of	microbial	and	other	danger	signals	in	both	health	and	
pathologic	states.

•	 Innate  immune  system—ancient	 immune	 recognition	 system	 of	
host	 cells	 bearing	 germline-encoded	 pattern	 recognition	 receptors	
(PRRs)	 that	 recognize	 pathogens	 and	 trigger	 a	 variety	 of	 mecha-
nisms	of	pathogen	elimination.	Cells	of	the	innate	immune	system	
include	NK	cell	lymphocytes,	monocytes/macrophages,	DCs,	neu-
trophils,	basophils,	eosinophils,	tissue	mast	cells,	and	epithelial	cells.

2672 •	 Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)—lymphocytes	that	do	not	express	the	
type	 of	 diversified	 antigen	 receptors	 on	 T	 cell	 and	 B	 cells.	 ILC1s,	
ILC2s,	and	ILC3s	are	tissue	resident	cells	and	functionally	are	anal-
ogous	to	CD4	TH1,	TH2,	and	TH17	cells,	respectively.

•	 Natural killer (NK) cells—a	type	of	ILC	that	kills	target	cells	express-
ing	 few	 or	 no	 human	 leukocyte	 antigen	 (HLA)	 class	 I	 molecules,	
such	as	malignantly	transformed	cells	and	virally	infected	cells.	NK	
cells	 express	 receptors	 that	 inhibit	 killer	 cell	 function	 when	 self-
MHC	class	I	is	present.	Innate	NK	cells	mirror	the	functions	of	CD8	
cytotoxic	T	cells	of	the	adaptive	immune	system.

•	 NK  T  cells—innate-like	 lymphocytes	 that	 use	 an	 invariant	 T-cell	
receptor	 (TCR)-α	 chain	 combined	 with	 a	 limited	 set	 of	 TCR-β	
chains	and	coexpress	receptors	commonly	found	on	NK	cells.	NK	T	
cells	recognize	lipid	antigens	of	bacterial,	viral,	fungal,	and	protozoal	
infectious	agents.

•	 Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)—invariant	molec-
ular	 structures	 expressed	 by	 large	 groups	 of	 microorganisms	 that	
are	 recognized	 by	 host	 cellular	 PRRs	 in	 the	 mediation	 of	 innate	
immunity.

•	 Pattern  recognition  receptors  (PRR)—germline-encoded	 receptors	
expressed	 by	 cells	 of	 the	 innate	 immune	 system	 that	 recognize	
PAMPs.

•	 Polyreactive antibodies—low-affinity	antibodies	produced	by	B	cells	
that	cross-react	with	multiple	antigens	and	are	available	at	the	time	
of	infection	to	bind	and	coat	invading	pathogens	and	harness	innate	
responses	to	slow	the	infection	until	an	adaptive	high-affinity	pro-
tective	antibody	response	can	be	made.

•	 T lymphocytes—thymus-derived	lymphocytes	that	mediate	adaptive	
cellular	 immune	 responses	 including	 T	 helper,	 T	 regulatory,	 and	
cytotoxic	T	lymphocyte	effector	cell	functions.

•	 T-cell  exhaustion—state	 of	 T	 cells	 when	 the	 persistence	 of	 antigen	
disrupts	 memory	 T-cell	 function,	 resulting	 in	 defects	 in	 memory	
T-cell	 responses.	 Most	 frequently	 occurs	 in	 malignancies	 and	 in	
chronic	viral	infections	such	as	HIV-1	and	hepatitis	C.

•	 TCR  for  antigen—complex	 of	 surface	 molecules	 that	 rearrange	
during	postnatal	T-cell	development	made	up	of	clonotypic	TCR-α	
and	-β	chains	that	are	associated	with	the	CD3	complex	composed	
of	invariant	γ,	δ,	ε,	ζ,	and	η	chains.	TCR-α	and	-β	chains	recognize	
peptide	fragments	of	protein	antigen	physically	bound	in	APC	MHC	
class	I	or	II	molecules,	leading	to	signaling	via	the	CD3	complex	to	
mediate	effector	functions.

•	 T follicular helper T cells (Tfh)—CD4	T	cells	regulated	by	bcl-6	in	
B-cell	 follicle	 germinal	 centers	 that	 produce	 IL-4	 and	 IL-21	 and	
drive	 B-cell	 differentiation	 and	 affinity	 maturation	 in	 peripheral	
lymphoid	tissues	such	as	lymph	node	and	spleen.

•	 TH1  T  cells—CD4	 helper	 T-cell	 subset	 regulated	 by	 transcription	
factor	T-bet	that	produces	interferon	(IFN)-γ,	IL-2,	and	TNF-β	and	
participates	in	cell-mediated	immunity.

•	 TH2 T cells—CD4	helper	T-cell	subset	regulated	by	transcription	fac-
tors	STAT6	and	GATA3	that	produces	IL-4,	IL-5,	IL-6,	IL-9,	IL-10,	
and	IL-13	and	regulates	antibody	and	eosinophil	responses.

•	 T  regulatory  cells  (Treg)—CD4	 and	 CD8	 T	 cells	 regulated	 by	 the	
transcription	factor	Foxp3	that	play	roles	in	modulating	the	immune	
system	 to	 prevent	 deleterious	 immune	 activation.	 Expression	 of	
Foxp3	is	a	defining	Treg	marker.

•	 TH9 T cells—CD4	T	cells	regulated	by	the	transcription	factor	PU.1	
that	 secrete	 IL-9	 and	 enhance	 inflammation	 in	 atopic	 disease	 and	
inflammatory	bowel	disease	as	well	as	mediate	antitumor	immunity.
•	 TH13 T cells—T	follicular	helper	cells	(Tfh)	regulated	by	the	GATA3	
transcription	 factor	 that	 produce	 IL-4,	 IL-5,	 and	 IL-13.	 TH13	 Tfh	
induce	high-affinity	IgE	antibody	responses	that	cause	anaphylactic	
reactions	to	allergens.

•	 TH17  T  cells—CD4	 T	 cells	 regulated	 by	 the	 transcription	 factor	
RORγt	that	secrete	IL-17,	IL-22,	and	IL-26	and	play	roles	in	auto-
immune	inflammatory	disorders	as	well	as	defend	against	bacterial	
and	fungal	pathogens.

•	 Tolerance—B-	and	T-cell	nonresponsiveness	to	antigens	that	results	
from	 encounter	 with	 foreign	 or	 self-antigens	 by	 B	 and	 T	 lym-
phocytes	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 expression	 of	 APC	 co-stimulatory	

molecules.	 Tolerance	 to	 antigens	 may	 be	 induced	 and	 maintained	
by	 multiple	 mechanisms	 either	 centrally	 (B-cell	 deletion	 in	 the	
thymus	for	T	cells	or	bone	marrow	for	B	cells)	or	peripherally	(by	
cell	 deletion	 or	 anergy	 at	 sites	 throughout	 the	 peripheral	 immune		
system).

•	 Trained  immunity—the	 epigenetic,	 transcriptional,	 and	 functional	
reprogramming	of	innate	immune	cells	to	adapt	to	previous	encoun-
ters	with	pathogens	and	respond	to	a	second	challenge	in	an	altered	
manner.

 ■ INTRODUCTION
The	 human	 immune	 system	 has	 evolved	 over	 millions	 of	 years	 from	
both	 invertebrate	 and	 vertebrate	 organisms	 to	 develop	 sophisticated	
defense	 mechanisms	 that	 protect	 the	 host	 from	 microbes	 and	 their	
virulence	factors.	The	normal	immune	system	has	three	key	properties:	
a	highly	diverse	repertoire	of	antigen	receptors	that	enables	recognition	
of	 a	 nearly	 infinite	 range	 of	 pathogens;	 immune	 memory,	 to	 mount	
rapid	recall	immune	responses;	and	immunologic	tolerance,	to	avoid	
immune	 damage	 to	 normal	 self-tissues.	 From	 invertebrates,	 humans	
have	 inherited	 the	 innate  immune  system,	 an	 ancient	 defense	 system	
that	uses	germline-encoded	proteins	to	recognize	pathogens.	Cells	of	
the	innate	immune	system,	such	as	macrophages,	DCs,	and	NK	lym-
phocytes,	 recognize	 PAMPs	 that	 are	 highly	 conserved	 among	 many	
microbes	and	use	a	diverse	set	of	PRR	molecules.	Important	compo-
nents	 of	 the	 recognition	 of	 microbes	 by	 the	 innate	 immune	 system	
include	recognition	by	germline-encoded	host	molecules,	recognition	
of	key	microbe	virulence	factors	but	not	recognition	of	self-molecules,	
and	 nonrecognition	 of	 benign	 foreign	 molecules	 or	 microbes.	 Upon	
contact	 with	 pathogens,	 cells	 of	 the	 innate	 immune	 system	 may	 kill	
pathogens	directly	or,	in	concert	with	DCs,	activate	a	series	of	events	
that	 both	 slow	 the	 infection	 and	 recruit	 the	 more	 recently	 evolved	
arm	 of	 the	 human	 immune	 system,	 the	 adaptive  immune  system.	 In	
addition,	innate	immune	cells	undergo	epigenetic,	transcriptional,	and	
functional	 changes	 that	 allow	 adapted	 (either	 enhanced	 or	 reduced)	
innate	 cell	 responses	 to	 repeat	 encounters	 with	 pathogens,	 called	
trained immunity.

Adaptive	immunity	is	found	only	in	vertebrates	and	is	based	on	the	
generation	of	antigen	receptors	on	T	and	B	lymphocytes	by	gene	rear-
rangements,	such	that	individual	T	or	B	cells	express	unique	antigen	
receptors	 on	 their	 surface	 capable	 of	 specifically	 recognizing	 diverse	
antigens	of	infectious	agents	in	the	environment.	Coupled	with	specific	
recognition	 mechanisms	 that	 maintain	 tolerance	 (nonreactivity)	 to	
self-antigens	(Chap. 350),	T	and	B	lymphocytes	bring	both	specificity	
and	immune memory	to	vertebrate	host	defenses.

This	 chapter	 describes	 the	 cellular	 components,	 key	 molecules	
(Table 349-1),	and	mechanisms	that	make	up	the	innate	and	adaptive	
immune	systems	and	describes	how	adaptive	immunity	is	recruited	to	
the	defense	of	the	host	by	innate	immune	responses.	An	appreciation	
of	 the	 cellular	 and	 molecular	 bases	 of	 innate	 and	 adaptive	 immune	
responses	 is	 critical	 to	 understanding	 the	 pathogenesis	 of	 inflam-
matory,	 autoimmune,	 infectious,	 and	 immunodeficiency	 diseases,	 as	
well	as	a	wide	range	of	diseases	associated	with	inflammation	such	as	
atherosclerotic	cardiovascular	disease	and	neurodegenerative	diseases.

 ■ THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM
All	multicellular	organisms,	including	humans,	have	developed	the	use	
of	surface	and	intracellular	germline-encoded	molecules	that	recognize	
pathogens.	Because	of	the	myriad	of	human	pathogens,	host	molecules	
of	the	human	innate	immune	system	sense	“danger	signals”	and	either	
recognize	 PAMPs,	 the	 common	 molecular	 structures	 shared	 by	 many	
pathogens,	 or	 recognize	 host	 cell	 molecules	 produced	 in	 response	 to	
infection	such	as	heat	shock	proteins	and	fragments	of	the	extracellular	
matrix.	PAMPs	must	be	conserved	structures	vital	to	pathogen	virulence	
and	 survival,	 such	 as	 bacterial	 endotoxin,	 so	 that	 pathogens	 cannot	
mutate	molecules	of	PAMPs	to	evade	human	innate	immune	responses.	
PRRs	 are	 host	 proteins	 of	 the	 innate	 immune	 system	 that	 recognize	
PAMPs	 as	 host	 danger	 signal	 molecules	 (Tables  349-2  and  349-3).		
Thus,	 recognition	 of	 pathogen	 molecules	 by	 hematopoietic	 and

 ■ PATTERN RECOGNITION
Major	PRR	families	of	proteins	include	transmembrane	proteins,	such	
as	the	Toll-like	receptors	(TLRs)	and	C-type	lectin	receptors	(CLRs),	
and	 cytoplasmic	 proteins,	 such	 as	 the	 retinoic	 acid–inducible	 gene	
(RIG)-1-like	receptors	(RLRs)	and	NOD-like	receptors	(NLRs)	(Table	
349-3).	A	major	group	of	PRR	collagenous	glycoproteins	with	C-type	
lectin	 domains	 are	 termed	 collectins	 and	 include	 the	 serum	 protein	
mannose-binding	lectin	(MBL).	MBL	and	other	collectins,	as	well	as	
two	other	protein	families—the	pentraxins	(such	as	C-reactive	protein	
and	serum	amyloid	P)	and	macrophage	scavenger	receptors—all	have	
the	property	of	opsonizing	(coating)	bacteria	for	phagocytosis	by	mac-
rophages	and	can	also	activate	the	complement	cascade	to	lyse	bacteria.	
Integrins	 are	 cell-surface	 adhesion	 molecules	 that	 affect	 attachment	
between	cells	and	the	extracellular	matrix	and	mediate	signal	transduc-
tion	that	reflects	the	chemical	composition	of	the	cell	environment.	For	
example,	 integrins	 signal	 after	 cells	 bind	 bacterial	 lipopolysaccharide	
(LPS)	and	activate	phagocytic	cells	to	ingest	pathogens.

There	 are	 multiple	 connections	 between	 the	 innate	 and	 adaptive	
immune	 systems;	 these	 include	 (1)	 a	 plasma	 protein,	 LPS-binding	
protein,	 that	 binds	 and	 transfers	 LPS	 to	 the	 macrophage	 LPS	 recep-
tor,	 CD14;	 (2)	 a	 human	 family	 of	 proteins	 called	 Toll-like  receptor 
proteins	 (TLRs),	 some	 of	 which	 are	 associated	 with	 CD14,	 bind	 LPS,	
and	 signal	 epithelial	 cells,	 DCs,	 and	 macrophages	 to	 produce	 cytok-
ines	 and	 upregulate	 cell-surface	 molecules	 that	 signal	 the	 initiation	
of	 adaptive	 immune	 responses	 (Fig.  349-1,	 Table  349-3;	 and	 (3)	
families	of	intracellular	microbial	sensors	called	NLRs	and	RLRs.	Pro-
teins	 in	 the	 Toll	 family	 can	 be	 expressed	 on	 macrophages,	 DCs,	 and

2676 B	cells	as	well	as	on	a	variety	of	non-hematopoietic	cell	types,	including	
respiratory	epithelial	cells.	Eleven	TLRs	have	been	identified	in	humans	
(Table	 349-3).	 Upon	 ligation,	 TLRs	 activate	 a	 series	 of	 intracellular	
events	that	lead	to	the	killing	of	bacteria-	and	viral-infected	cells	as	well	
as	to	the	recruitment	and	ultimate	activation	of	antigen-specific	T	and	
B	lymphocytes	(Fig.	349-1).	Importantly,	signaling	by	massive	amounts	
of	 LPS	 through	 TLR4	 leads	 to	 the	 release	 of	 high	 levels	 of	 cytokines	
that	mediate	LPS-induced	shock.	Mutations	in	TLR4	proteins	in	mice	
protect	from	LPS	shock,	and	TLR	mutations	in	humans	protect	from	
LPS-induced	inflammatory	diseases	such	as	LPS-induced	asthma.

Two	other	families	of	cytoplasmic	PRRs	are	the	NLRs	and	the	RLRs.	
These	 families,	 unlike	 the	 TLRs,	 are	 composed	 primarily	 of	 soluble	
intracellular	 proteins	 that	 scan	 host	 cell	 cytoplasm	 for	 intracellular	
pathogens	(Tables	349-2	and	349-3).

The	 intracellular	 microbial	 sensors,	 NLRs,	 after	 triggering,	 form	
large	cytoplasmic	complexes	termed	inflammasomes,	which	are	aggre-
gates	 of	 molecules	 including	 NOD-like	 receptor	 pyrin	 (NLRP)	 pro-
teins	 (Table  349-4).	 Inflammasomes	 activate	 inflammatory	 caspases	
and	 IL-1β	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 nonbacterial	 danger	 signals	 (cell	 stress)	
and	 bacterial	 PAMPs.	 Mutations	 in	 inflammasome	 proteins	 can	 lead	
to	 chronic	 inflammation	 in	 a	 group	 of	 periodic	 febrile	 diseases	 called	
autoinflammatory  syndromes.	 Polymorphisms	 in	 inflammasome	 com-
ponents	can	either	protect	or	enhance	risk	of	infections	or	autoimmune/
autoinflammatory	diseases	(Table	349-4).	Inflammasomes	are	activated	
upon	sensing	of	PAMPs.	Crystallopathies	are	diseases	caused	by	tissue	
crystal	 deposition	 such	 as	 monosodium	 urate	 that	 can	 activate	 the	
inflammasome	and,	in	the	case	of	urate	deposition,	can	lead	to	gout	with	
arthritis	or	renal	disease.
 ■ EFFECTOR CELLS OF INNATE IMMUNITY
Cells	 of	 the	 innate	 immune	 system	 and	 their	 roles	 in	 the	 first	 line	
of	 host	 defense	 are	 listed	 in	 Table	 349-5.	 Equally	 important	 as	 their	
roles	in	the	mediation	of	innate	immune	responses	are	the	roles	that	
each	cell	type	plays	in	recruiting	T	and	B	lymphocytes	of	the	adaptive	
immune	system	to	engage	in	specific	pathogen	responses.

Monocytes-Macrophages  Monocytes	 arise	 from	 precursor	 cells	
within	bone	marrow	 (Fig. 349-2)	and	circulate	with	a	half-life	rang-
ing	 from	 1	 to	 3	 days.	 Monocytes	 leave	 the	 peripheral	 circulation	 via	
capillaries	and	migration	into	a	vast	extravascular	cellular	pool.	Tissue	
macrophages	arise	from	monocytes	that	have	migrated	out	of	the	cir-
culation	and	by	in	situ	proliferation	of	macrophage	precursors	in	tissue.	
Common	 locations	 where	 tissue	 macrophages	 (and	 certain	 of	 their	
specialized	 forms)	 are	 found	 are	 lymph	 node,	 spleen,	 bone	 marrow,	
perivascular	connective	tissue,	serous	cavities	such	as	the	peritoneum,	
pleura,	 skin	 connective	 tissue,	 lung	 (alveolar	 macrophages),	 liver	
(Kupffer	 cells),	 bone	 (osteoclasts),	 central	 nervous	 system	 (microglia	
cells),	and	synovium	(type	A	lining	cells).

In	general,	monocytes-macrophages	are	on	the	first	line	of	defense	
associated	with	innate	immunity	and	ingest	and	destroy	microorgan-
isms	through	the	release	of	toxic	products	such	as	hydrogen	peroxide	
(H2O2)	 and	 nitric	 oxide	 (NO).	 Inflammatory	 mediators	 produced	 by	
macrophages	 attract	 additional	 effector	 cells	 such	 as	 neutrophils	 to	
the	 site	 of	 infection.	 Macrophage	 mediators	 include	 prostaglandins;	
leukotrienes;	platelet	activating	factor;	cytokines	such	as	IL-1,	TNF-α,	
IL-6,	and	IL-12;	and	chemokines	(Tables 349-6 and 349-7).

Although	 monocytes-macrophages	 were	 originally	 thought	 to	 be	
the	major	APCs	of	the	immune	system,	it	is	now	clear	that	cell	types	
called	dendritic cells	are	the	most	potent	and	effective	APCs	in	the	body	
(see	below).	Monocytes-macrophages	mediate	innate	immune	effector	
functions	such	as	destruction	of	antibody-coated	bacteria,	tumor	cells,	
or	 even	 normal	 hematopoietic	 cells	 in	 certain	 types	 of	 autoimmune	
cytopenias.	 Monocytes-macrophages	 ingest	 bacteria	 or	 are	 infected	
by	viruses,	and	in	doing	so,	they	frequently	undergo	programmed	cell	
death	or	apoptosis.	Macrophages	that	are	infected	by	intracellular	infec-
tious	agents	are	recognized	by	DCs	as	infected	and	apoptotic	cells	and	
are	phagocytosed	by	DCs.	In	this	manner,	DCs	“cross-present”	infec-
tious	agent	antigens	of	macrophages	to	T	cells.	Activated	macrophages	
can	 also	 mediate	 antigen-nonspecific	 lytic	 activity	 and	 eliminate	 cell	

types	 such	 as	 tumor	 cells	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 antibody.	 This	 activity	
is	 largely	 mediated	 by	 cytokines	 (i.e.,	 TNF-α	 and	 IL-1).	 Monocytes-	
macrophages	 express	 lineage-specific	 molecules	 (e.g.,	 the	 cell-surface	
LPS	receptor,	CD14)	as	well	as	surface	receptors	for	a	number	of	mol-
ecules,	including	the	Fc	region	of	IgG,	activated	complement	compo-
nents,	and	various	cytokines	(Table	349-6).

Dendritic  Cells  Human	 DCs	 contain	 several	 subsets,	 including	
myeloid	 DCs	 and	 plasmacytoid	 DCs.	 Myeloid	 DCs	 can	 differentiate	
into	either	macrophages-monocytes	or	tissue-specific	DCs.	In	contrast	
to	myeloid	DCs,	plasmacytoid	DCs	are	inefficient	APCs	but	are	potent	
producers	 of	 type	 I	 IFN	 (e.g.,	 IFN-α)	 in	 response	 to	 viral	 infections.	
The	 maturation	 of	 DCs	 is	 regulated	 through	 cell-to-cell	 contact	 and	
soluble	factors,	and	DCs	attract	immune	effectors	through	secretion	of	
chemokines.	When	DCs	come	in	contact	with	bacterial	products,	viral	
proteins,	 or	 host	 proteins	 released	 as	 danger	 signals	 from	 distressed	
host	 cells	 (Fig.	 349-2),	 infectious	 agent	 molecules	 bind	 to	 various	
TLRs	and	activate	DCs	to	release	cytokines	and	chemokines	that	drive	
cells	of	the	innate	immune	system	to	become	activated	to	respond	to	
invading	organisms,	and	recruit	T	and	B	cells	of	the	adaptive	immune	
system	 to	 respond.	 Plasmacytoid	 DCs	 produce	 antiviral	 IFN-α	 that	
activates	NK	cell	killing	of	pathogen-infected	cells;	IFN-α	also	activates	
T	cells	to	mature	into	antipathogen	cytotoxic	(killer)	T	cells.	Following	
contact	with	pathogens,	both	plasmacytoid	and	myeloid	DCs	produce	
chemokines	that	attract	helper	and	cytotoxic	T	cells,	B	cells,	polymor-
phonuclear	cells,	and	naïve	and	memory	T	cells	as	well	as	regulatory	
T cells	to	ultimately	dampen	the	immune	response	once	the	pathogen	
is	controlled.	TLR	engagement	on	DCs	upregulates	MHC	class	II,	B7-1	
(CD80),	 and	 B7-2	 (CD86),	 which	 enhance	 DC-specific	 antigen	 pre-
sentation	 and	 induce	 cytokine	 production.	 Thus,	 DCs	 are	 important	
bridges	between	early	(innate)	and	later	(adaptive)	immunity.	DCs	also	
modulate	 and	 determine	 the	 types	 of	 immune	 responses	 induced	 by	
pathogens	via	the	TLRs	expressed	on	DCs	(TLR7–9	on	plasmacytoid	
DCs,	 TLR4	 on	 monocytoid	 DCs)	 and	 via	 the	 TLR	 adapter	 proteins	
that	are	induced	to	associate	with	TLRs	(Fig.	349-1,	Table	349-1).	In	
addition,	 other	 PRRs,	 such	 as	 C-type	 lectins,	 NLRs,	 and	 mannose	
receptors,	 upon	 ligation	 by	 pathogen	 products,	 activate	 cells	 of	 the	
adaptive	immune	system	and,	like	TLR	stimulation,	by	a	variety	of	fac-
tors,	determine	the	type	and	quality	of	the	adaptive	immune	response	
that	is	triggered.

Innate Lymphoid Cells 
ILCs	are	comprised	of	ILC1,	ILC2,	ILC3,	
lymphoid	 tissue	 inducer	 (LTi),	 and	 NK	 cells.	 ILC1,	 ILC2,	 ILC3,	 and	
LTi	 are	 primarily	 tissue	 resident	 cells.	 ILCs	 develop	 from	 a	 common	
lymphoid	 precursor	 in	 the	 bone	 marrow	 and	 then	 differentiate	 into	
one	of	five	ILC	types—ILC1,	ILC2,	ILC3,	LTi,	or	NK	cells—based	on	
their	development	(Fig. 349-3A)	and	function	(Fig. 349-3B).	NK	cells	
and	ILC1s	depend	on	T-bet	transcription	factor	for	their	development	
and	function	and	produce	IFN-γ.	NK	cells	are	innate	analogues	to	CD8	
cytotoxic	 T	 cells	 in	 that	 they	 both	 mediate	 granzyme	 and	 perforin-	
based	cytotoxic	cell	activity.	ILC1s	mirror	CD4	TH1	lymphocytes	and	
react	to	intracellular	pathogens	such	as	viruses	and	to	tumors.	ILC2s	
are	the	analogues	of	TH2	CD4	T	cells	and	are	dependent	on	GATA3	and	
RORα	factors	and	produce	type	2	cytokines,	such	as	IL-5	and	IL-13.	
ILC2s	respond	to	extracellular	parasites	and	allergens.	ILC3s	and	LTi	
cells	are	dependent	on	transcription	factor	RORγ1	and	produce	IL-17.	
ILC3s	 are	 analogues	 of	 CD4	 TH17	 lymphocytes	 and	 attack	 extracel-
lular	 pathogens	 such	 as	 bacteria	 and	 fungi.	 LTi	 cells	 are	 critical	 for	
the	formation	of	lymph	nodes	and	Peyer’s	patches	in	gut	during	fetal	
development	(Fig.	349-3B).

NK	cells	express	surface	receptors	for	the	Fc	portion	of	IgG	(FcR)	
(CD16)	 and	 for	 NCAM-I	 (CD56),	 and	 many	 NK	 cells	 express	 T	
lineage	 markers,	 particularly	 CD2,	 CD7,	 and	 CD8,	 and	 proliferate	
in	response	to	IL-2.	NK	cells	arise	in	both	bone	marrow	and	thymic	
microenvironments.	 In	 addition	 to	 mediating	 cytotoxicity	 to	 foreign	
or	malignant	cells,	NK	cells	also	mediate	ADCC.	ADCC	is	the	binding	
of	an	opsonized	(antibody-coated)	target	cell	to	an	Fc	receptor-bearing	
effector	cell	via	the	Fc	region	of	antibody,	resulting	in	target	cell	lysis.	
NK	cell	cytotoxicity	is	the	MHC-unrestricted,	non-antibody-mediated

Note: Mutated gene and respective syndrome name are reported for inflammasomopathies, as well as inheritance pattern and effect of mutations, clinical phenotype, and 
predominant disease effector cells. Inflammasome variants previously associated with infectious agents and/or diseases are briefly resumed from literature (https://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed). Significantly associated polymorphisms were grouped according to the infectious agent/disease. Infectious agent or disease (in alphabetical 
order), gene name (gene), identification number of polymorphism (ID), resulting effect on inflammasome activation (“increased,” “decreased,” or “unknown”), cohort origin 
(cohort) and eventually specifications (severity, etc.), sample size (n), and type (case/control or cases only), association result (“risk” or “protection”), and respective

killing	 of	 target	 cells,	 which	 are	 usually	 malignant	 cell	 types,	 trans-
planted	foreign	cells,	or	virus-infected	cells.	Thus,	NK	cell	cytotoxicity	
may	play	an	important	role	in	immune	surveillance	and	destruction	of	
malignant	and	virus-infected	host	cells.	NK	cell	hyporesponsiveness	is

mal	 recessive	 disease	 associated	 with	 fusion	 of	 cytoplasmic	 granules

NK	 cells	 have	 a	 variety	 of	 surface	 receptors	 that	 have	 inhibitory	
or	 activating	 functions	 and	 belong	 to	 two	 structural	 families.	 These	
families	 include	 the	 immunoglobulin	 superfamily	 and	 the	 lectin-like	
type	 II	 transmembrane	 proteins.	 NK	 immunoglobulin	 superfamily	
receptors	 include	 the	 killer	 cell	 immunoglobulin-like	 activating	 or	

inhibitory	receptors	(KIRs),	many	of	which	have	been	shown	to	have	
HLA	class	I	ligands.	The	KIRs	are	made	up	proteins	with	either	two	
(KIR2D)	 or	 three	 (KIR3D)	 extracellular	 immunoglobulin	 domains	
(D).	Moreover,	their	nomenclature	designates	their	function	as	either	
inhibitory	KIRs	with	a	long	(L)	cytoplasmic	tail	and	immunoreceptor	
tyrosine-based	 inhibitory	 motif	 (ITIM)	 (KIRDL)	 or	 activating	 KIRs

MAJOR ROLE IN ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY
Produce IL-1 and TNF-α to upregulate lymphocyte adhesion 
molecules and chemokines to attract antigen-specific lymphocyte. 
Produce IL-12 to recruit TH1 T helper cell responses; upregulate 
co-stimulatory and MHC molecules to facilitate T and B lymphocyte 
recognition and activation. Macrophages and dendritic cells, after 
LPS signaling, upregulate co-stimulatory molecules B7-1 (CD80) and 
B7-2 (CD86) that are required for activation of pathogen-specific T 
cells. There are also Toll-like proteins on B cells and dendritic cells 
that, after LPS ligation, induce CD80 and CD86 on these cells for T-cell 
antigen presentation.
IFN-α is a potent activator of macrophage and mature DCs to 
phagocytose invading pathogens and present pathogen antigens to T 
and B cells.
Interstitial DCs are potent activators of macrophage and mature DCs 
to phagocytose invading pathogens and present pathogen antigens to 
T and B cells.

Produce IFN-γ to recruit CD4 TH1 T cells

Produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-13; recruit CD4 TH2 T cells

Produce IL-22, IL-17, GM-CSF, lymphotoxin; recruit CD4 TH17 T cells

Produce lymphotoxin for lymph node and Peyer’s patch development 
in which adaptive immune responses occur
Produce TNF-α and IFN-γ, which recruit TH1 helper T-cell responses

Produce IL-4 to recruit TH2 helper T-cell responses, IgG1 and IgE 
production

Produce nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide, which inhibit apoptosis 
in lymphocytes and can prolong adaptive immune responses
Produce IL-5, which recruits Ig-specific antibody responses
Produce IL-4, which recruits TH2 helper T cell responses, and recruit 
IgG1- and IgE-specific antibody responses

Produces TGF-β, which triggers IgA-specific antibody responses

Plasmacytoid dendritic 
cells (DCs) of lymphoid 
lineage
Myeloid DCs are of two 
types: interstitial and 
Langerhans-derived

ILC1 cells

ILC2 cells

ILC3 cells

Lymphoid tissue inducer 
(LTi) cells
Natural killer (NK) cells

NK-T cells

Neutrophils

Produce large amounts of interferon-α (IFN-α), which has 
antitumor and antiviral activity, and are found in T-cell zones of 
lymphoid organs; they circulate in blood
Interstitial DCs are strong producers of IL-12 and IL-10 and are 
located in T-cell zones of lymphoid organs, circulate in blood, 
and are present in the interstices of the lung, heart, and kidney; 
Langerhans DCs are strong producers of IL-12; are located in T-cell 
zones of lymph nodes, skin epithelia, and the thymic medulla; and 
circulate in blood
Weakly cytotoxic, dependent on T-bet transcription factor, first line 
of defense against viruses and bacteria
Mediate innate responses to parasites/helminths, repair damaged 
tissues by producing amphiregulin
Innate immune response to extracellular bacteria and gut 
microbiome
Critical for formation of secondary lymphoid tissue during 
embryogenesis
Kill foreign and host cells that have low levels of MHC+ self-
peptides. Express NK receptors that inhibit NK function in the 
presence of high expression of self-MHC.
Lymphocytes with both T-cell and NK surface markers that 
recognize lipid antigens of intracellular bacteria such as 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis by CD1 molecules and kill host cells 
infected with intracellular bacteria
Phagocytose and kill bacteria, produce antimicrobial peptides

Eosinophils
Mast cells and basophils Release TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ in response to a variety of bacterial 

Kill invading parasites

Epithelial cells

PAMPs
Produce antimicrobial peptides; tissue-specific epithelia produce 
mediator of local innate immunity; e.g., lung epithelial cells produce 
surfactant proteins (proteins within the collectin family) that bind

include	NKp46,	NKp30,	and	NKp44.	These	receptors	help	to	mediate	
NK	cell	activation	against	target	cells.	The	ligands	to	which	NCRs	bind	
on	target	cells	have	been	recently	recognized	to	be	comprised	of	mole-
cules	of	pathogens	such	as	influenza,	cytomegalovirus,	and	malaria	as	
well	as	host	molecules	expressed	on	tumor	cells.

NK	cell	signaling	is,	therefore,	a	highly	coordinated	series	of	inhib-
iting	 and	 activating	 signals	 that	 prevent	 NK	 cells	 from	 responding	
to	 uninfected,	 nonmalignant	 self-cells;	 however,	 they	 are	 activated	
to	 attack	 malignant	 and	 virally	 infected	 cells	 (Fig.  349-4).	 Recent	
evidence	suggests	that	NK	cells,	although	not	possessing	rearranging	
immune	 recognition	 genes,	 may	 be	 able	 to	 mediate	 recall	 for	 NK	
cell	 responses	 to	 viruses	 and	 for	 immune	 responses	 such	 as	 contact	
hypersensitivity.

Some	NK	cells	express	CD3	and	invariant	TCR-α	chains	and	are	
termed	 NK  T  cells.	 TCRs	 of	 NK	 T	 cells	 recognize	 lipid	 molecules	
of	 intracellular	 bacteria	 when	 presented	 in	 the	 context	 of	 CD1	
molecules	 on	 APCs.	 Upon	 activation,	 NK	 T	 cells	 secrete	 effector	
cytokines	such	as	IL-4	and	IFN-γ.	This	mode	of	recognition	of	intra-
cellular	bacteria	such	as	Listeria monocytogenes	and	Mycobacterium 

tuberculosis	by	NK	T	cells	leads	to	induction	of	activation	of	DCs	and	
is	thought	to	be	an	important	innate	defense	mechanism	against	these		
organisms.

The	receptors	for	the	Fc	portion	of	IgG	(FcγRs)	are	present	on	NK	
cells,	 B	 cells,	 macrophages,	 neutrophils,	 and	 mast	 cells	 and	 mediate	
interactions	 of	 IgG	 with	 antibody-coated	 target	 cells,	 such	 as	 virally	
infected	 cells.	 Antibody-NK	 interaction	 via	 antibody	 Fc	 and	 NK	 cell	
FcR	links	the	adaptive	and	innate	immune	systems	and	regulates	the	
mediation	of	IgG	antibody	effector	functions	such	as	ADCC.	There	are	
both	activation	and	inhibitory	FcγRs.	Activation	FcRs,	such	as	FcγRI	
(CD64),	 FcγRIIa	 (CD32a),	 and	 FcγRIIIa	 (CD16a),	 are	 characterized	
by	the	presence	of	an	immunoreceptor	tyrosine-based	activating	motif	
(ITAM)	sequence,	whereas	inhibitory	FcRs,	such	as	FcγRIIb	(CD32b),	
contain	 an	 ITIM	 sequence.	 There	 is	 evidence	 that	 dysregulation	 in	
IgG-FcγR	 interactions	 plays	 roles	 in	 arthritis,	 multiple	 sclerosis,	 and	
systemic	lupus	erythematosus.

Neutrophils,  Eosinophils,  and  Basophils  Granulocytes	 are	
present	 in	 nearly	 all	 forms	 of	 inflammation	 and	 are	 amplifiers	 and

FIGURE  349-2  Model  of  immune  effector  cell  development.  Hematopoietic  stem  cells  differentiate  into  T  cells,  antigen-presenting  dendritic  cells,  natural  killer  cells, 
macrophages, granulocytes, or B cells. Foreign antigen is processed by dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and peptide fragments of foreign antigen are presented 
to CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T-cell activation leads to induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) or killer T-cell generation, as well as induction of cytokine-producing 
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils) are effector cells of the innate immune system and mediate anti-infectious agent activity 
by cytokine production, infectious agent killing, or both. TH1 CD4+ T cells play an important role in defense against intracellular microbes and help in the generation of  
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. TH2 CD4+ T cells producing interferon (IFN) γ or interleukin (IL) 4, IL-5, or IL-13 regulate Ig class switching and determine the type of antibody produced. 
TH17 cells secrete IL-17 and IL-22, TH9 cells secrete IL-9, and Tfh13 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. TH17 and TH9 CD4 T cells are linked to mediation of autoimmune disease, 
and Tfh13 cells are linked to IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. CD4+ T regulatory cells produce IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and downregulate T- and B-cell 
responses once the microbe has been eliminated. Each of the types of CD4+ T cells are regulated by different transcription factors, and the key transcription factors are 
shown in the circles above each CD4+ T-cell type.

effectors	 of	 innate	 immune	 responses	 (Fig.	 349-2).	 Unchecked	 accu-
mulation	and	activation	of	granulocytes	can	lead	to	host	tissue	damage,	
as	 seen	 in	 neutrophil-	 and	 eosinophil-mediated	 systemic  necrotizing 
vasculitis.	 Granulocytes	 are	 derived	 from	 stem	 cells	 in	 bone	 marrow.	
Each	 type	 of	 granulocyte	 (neutrophil,	 eosinophil,	 or	 basophil)	 is	
derived	from	a	different	subclass	of	progenitor	cell	that	is	stimulated	to	
proliferate	by	colony-stimulating	factors	(Table	349-6).	During	termi-
nal	maturation	of	granulocytes,	class-specific	nuclear	morphology	and	
cytoplasmic	granules	appear	that	allow	for	histologic	identification	of	
granulocyte	type.

Neutrophils	 express	 Fc	 receptor	 IIIa	 for	 IgG	 (CD16a)	 as	 well	 as	
receptors	for	activated	complement	components	(C3b	or	CD35).	Upon	
interaction	 of	 neutrophils	 with	 antibody-coated	 (opsonized)	 bacteria	
or	 immune	 complexes,	 azurophilic	 granules	 (containing	 myeloper-
oxidase,	lysozyme,	elastase,	and	other	enzymes)	and	specific	granules	
(containing	lactoferrin,	lysozyme,	collagenase,	and	other	enzymes)	are	
–)	 are	 generated	 at	
released,	 and	 microbicidal	 superoxide	 radicals	 (O2
the	neutrophil	surface.	The	generation	of	superoxide	leads	to	inflam-
mation	by	direct	injury	to	tissue	and	by	alteration	of	macromolecules	
such	as	collagen	and	DNA.

Eosinophils	are	potent	cytotoxic	effector	cells	for	various	parasitic	
organisms.	 In	 Nippostrongylus  brasiliensis	 helminth	 infection,	 eos-
inophils	 are	 important	 cytotoxic	 effector	 cells	 for	 removal	 of	 these	
parasites.	Key	to	regulation	of	eosinophil	cytotoxicity	to	N. brasilien-
sis	 worms	 are	 antigen-specific	 T	 helper	 cells	 that	 produce	 IL-4,	 thus	
providing	 an	 example	 of	 regulation	 of	 innate	 immune	 responses	 by	
adaptive	immunity	antigen-specific	T	cells.	Intracytoplasmic	contents	
of	eosinophils,	such	as	major	basic	protein,	eosinophil	cationic	protein,	
and	 eosinophil-derived	 neurotoxin,	 are	 capable	 of	 directly	 damaging	

tissues	and	may	be	responsible	in	part	for	the	organ	system	dysfunction	
in	the	hypereosinophilic syndromes	(Chap. 64).	Because	the	eosinophil	
granule	 contains	 anti-inflammatory	 types	 of	 enzymes	 (histaminase,	
arylsulfatase,	 phospholipase	 D),	 eosinophils	 may	 homeostatically	
downregulate	or	terminate	ongoing	inflammatory	responses.

Basophils	 and	 tissue	 mast	 cells	 are	 potent	 reservoirs	 of	 cytokines	
such	as	IL-4	and	can	respond	to	bacteria	and	viruses	with	antipatho-
gen	 cytokine	 production	 through	 multiple	 TLRs	 expressed	 on	 their	
surface.	Mast	cells	and	basophils	can	also	mediate	immunity	through	
the	 binding	 of	 antipathogen	 antibodies.	 This	 is	 a	 particularly	 impor-
tant	 host	 defense	 mechanism	 against	 parasitic	 diseases.	 Basophils	
express	 high-affinity	 surface	 receptors	 for	 IgE	 (FcεRII)	 (CD23)	 and,	
upon	 cross-linking	 of	 basophil-bound	 IgE	 by	 antigen,	 can	 release	
histamine,	 eosinophil	 chemotactic	 factor	 of	 anaphylaxis,	 and	 neutral	
protease—all	mediators	of	allergic	immediate	(anaphylaxis)	hypersen-
sitivity	responses.	In	addition,	basophils	express	surface	receptors	for	
activated	complement	components	(C3a,	C5a),	through	which	medi-
ator	 release	 can	 be	 directly	 affected.	 Thus,	 basophils,	 like	 most	 cells	
of	the	immune	system,	can	be	activated	in	the	service	of	host	defense	
against	pathogens,	or	they	can	be	activated	for	mediation	release	and	
cause	pathogenic	responses	in	allergic	and	inflammatory	diseases.	For 
further discussion of tissue mast cells, see Chap. 354.

The Complement System  The	complement	system,	an	important	
soluble	component	of	the	innate	immune	system,	is	a	series	of	plasma	
enzymes,	regulatory	proteins,	and	proteins	that	are	activated	in	a	cas-
cading	fashion,	resulting	in	cell	lysis.	There	are	four	pathways	of	the	
complement	system:	the	classic	activation	pathway	activated	by	antigen/	
antibody	immune	complexes,	the	MBL	(a	serum	collectin)	activation

pathway	 activated	 by	 microbes	 with	 terminal	 mannose	 groups,	 the	
alternative	 activation	 pathway	 activated	 by	 microbes	 or	 tumor	 cells,	
and	the	terminal	pathway	that	is	common	to	the	first	three	pathways	
and	leads	to	the	membrane	attack	complex	that	lyses	cells	(Fig. 349-5).	
The	series	of	enzymes	of	the	complement	system	are	serine	proteases.
Activation	of	the	classic	complement	pathway	via	immune	complex	
binding	to	C1q	links	the	innate	and	adaptive	immune	systems	via	spe-
cific	 antibody	 in	 the	 immune	 complex.	 The	 alternative	 complement	
activation	pathway	is	antibody-independent	and	is	activated	by	bind-
ing	of	C3	directly	to	pathogens	and	“altered	self ”	such	as	tumor	cells.	In	
the	renal	glomerular	inflammatory	disease	IgA nephropathy,	IgA	acti-
vates	the	alternative	complement	pathway	and	causes	glomerular	dam-
age	and	decreased	renal	function.	Activation	of	the	classic	complement	
pathway	via	C1,	C4,	and	C2	and	activation	of	the	alternative	pathway	
via	factor	D,	C3,	and	factor	B	both	lead	to	cleavage	and	activation	of	
C3.	 C3	 activation	 fragments,	 when	 bound	 to	 target	 surfaces	 such	 as	
bacteria	and	other	foreign	antigens,	are	critical	for	opsonization	(coat-
ing	by	antibody	and	complement)	in	preparation	for	phagocytosis.	The	
MBL	pathway	substitutes	MBL-associated	serine	proteases	(MASPs)	1	

and	2	for	C1q,	C1r,	and	C1s	to	activate	C4.	The	MBL	activation	path-
way	is	activated	by	mannose	on	the	surface	of	bacteria	and	viruses.

The	 three	 pathways	 of	 complement	 activation	 all	 converge	 on	 the	
final	common	terminal	pathway.	C3	cleavage	by	each	pathway	results	
in	 activation	 of	 C5,	 C6,	 C7,	 C8,	 and	 C9,	 resulting	 in	 the	 membrane	
attack	 complex	 that	 physically	 inserts	 into	 the	 membranes	 of	 target	
cells	or	bacteria	and	lyses	them.

Thus,	 complement	 activation	 is	 a	 critical	 component	 of	 innate	
immunity	for	responding	to	microbial	infection.	The	functional	conse-
quences	of	complement	activation	by	the	three	initiating	pathways	and	
the	terminal	pathway	are	shown	in	Fig.	349-5.	In	general,	the	cleavage	
products	 of	 complement	 components	 facilitate	 microbe	 or	 damaged	
cell	 clearance	 (C1q,	 C4,	 C3),	 promote	 activation	 and	 enhancement	
of	 inflammation	 (anaphylatoxins,	 C3a,	 C5a),	 and	 promote	 microbe	
or	 opsonized	 cell	 lysis	 (membrane	 attack	 complex).	 Deficiencies	 of	
early	complement	components	C1,	C4,	or	C2	can	be	associated	with	
autoimmune	 disorders	 or	 with	 encapsulated	 bacterial	 infections	 like		
Streptococcus  pneumoniae.	 Deficiencies	 of	 late	 complement	 compo-
nents	(C5-C9)	are	associated	with	increased	Neisseria	infections.

 ■ CYTOKINES
Cytokines	are	soluble	proteins	produced	by	a	wide	variety	of	cell	types	
(Tables	349-6	and	349-7).	They	are	critical	for	both	normal	innate	and	
adaptive	immune	responses,	and	their	expression	may	be	perturbed	in	
most	immune,	inflammatory,	and	infectious	disease	states.

Cytokines	 are	 involved	 in	 the	 regulation	 of	 the	 growth,	 develop-
ment,	and	activation	of	immune	system	cells	and	in	the	mediation	of	
the	inflammatory	response.	In	general,	cytokines	are	characterized	by	
considerable	 redundancy;	 different	 cytokines	 have	 similar	 functions.	
In	addition,	many	cytokines	are	pleiotropic	in	that	they	are	capable	of	

acting	on	many	different	cell	types.	This	pleiotropism	results	from	the	
expression	on	multiple	cell	types	of	receptors	for	the	same	cytokine	(see	
below),	leading	to	the	formation	of	“cytokine	networks.”	The	action	of	
cytokines	may	be	(1)	autocrine	when	the	target	cell	is	the	same	cell	that	
secretes	the	cytokine,	(2)	paracrine	when	the	target	cell	is	nearby,	and	
(3)	endocrine	when	the	cytokine	is	secreted	into	the	circulation	and	acts	
distal	to	the	source.

Cytokines	 have	 been	 named	 based	 on	 presumed	 targets	 or	 based	
on	presumed	functions.	Those	cytokines	that	are	thought	to	primarily	
target	leukocytes	have	been	named	IL-1,	-2,	-3,	etc.	Many	cytokines	that

FIGURE 349-3  Development and function of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). A. ILC development, mainly based on mouse ILC differentiation paths, is schematized. ILCs develop 
from common innate lymphoid progenitors (CILPs), which themselves differentiate from common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). CILPs can differentiate into natural killer (NK) 
cell precursor (NKP) cells or into common helper innate lymphoid progenitors (CHILPs), which themselves give rise to lymphoid tissue inducer progenitors (LTiPs) and innate 
lymphoid cell precursors (ILCPs). LTiPs differentiate into lymphoid tissue inducers (LTis) and ILCPs into ILC1, ILC2, or ILC3. Each stage of differentiation is dependent on the 
expression of the indicated transcription factors: NFIL3 (nuclear factor IL-3 induced), Id2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2), TOX (thymocyte selection-associated high mobility 
group box protein), TCF-1 (T-cell factor 1), ETS1 (avian erythroblastosis virus E26 homolog-1), GATA3 (GATA binding protein 3), PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger), 
T-bet (T-box transcription factor), Eomes (eomesodermin), RUNX3 (runt-related transcription factor 3), RORα (RAR-related orphan receptor α), Bcl11b (B cell lymphoma/
leukemia 11B), Gfi1 (growth factor independent 1), RORγt (RAR-related orphan receptor γt), and AHR (Aryl hydrocarbon receptor). It has been shown in humans that ILC1 
subsets may originate from precursors other than ILCPs, but the identity of these precursors remains unknown at this time. B. Some of the most well-known immune 
functions of each ILC subset are shown: NK cells and ILC1s react to intracellular pathogens, such as viruses, and to tumors; ILC2s respond to large extracellular parasites 
and allergens; ILC3s combat extracellular microbes, such as bacteria and fungi; and Lutes are involved in the formation of secondary lymphoid structures. For each ILC 
subset, effector molecules that can be produced upon activation are indicated AREG, amphiregulin; RANK, receptor activation of nuclear factor κB; RANK-L, RANK-ligand.

In	 this	 regard,	 cytokines	 can	 have	 dramatic	 effects	 on	 the	 regulation	
of	 immune	 responses	 and	 the	 pathogenesis	 of	 a	 variety	 of	 diseases.	
Indeed,	 T	 cells	 have	 been	 categorized	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 the	 pattern	 of	
cytokines	 that	 they	 secrete,	 which	 results	 in	 either	 humoral	 immune	
response	(TH2)	or	cell-mediated	immune	response	(TH1).	A	third	type	
of	T	helper	cell	is	the	TH17	cell	that	contributes	to	host	defense	against	
extracellular	bacteria	and	fungi,	particularly	at	mucosal	sites	(Fig.	349-2).
Cytokine receptors	can	be	grouped	into	five	general	families	based	on	
similarities	in	their	extracellular	amino	acid	sequences	and	conserved	
structural	domains.	The	immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily	represents	a	
large	number	of	cell-surface	and	secreted	proteins.	The	IL-1	receptors	
(type	1,	type	2)	are	examples	of	cytokine	receptors	with	extracellular	
Ig	domains.

The	 hallmark	 of	 the	 hematopoietic  growth  factor  (type  1)  receptor	
family	 is	 that	 the	 extracellular	 regions	 of	 each	 receptor	 contain	 two	
conserved	 motifs.	 One	 motif,	 located	 at	 the	 N	 terminus,	 is	 rich	 in	
cysteine	residues.	The	other	motif	is	located	at	the	C	terminus	proximal	
to	the	transmembrane	region	and	comprises	five	amino	acid	residues,	
tryptophan-serine-X-tryptophan-serine	(WSXWS).	This	family	can	be	
grouped	on	the	basis	of	the	number	of	receptor	subunits	they	have	and	
on	the	utilization	of	shared	subunits.	A	number	of	cytokine	receptors,	
i.e.,	IL-6,	IL-11,	IL-12,	and	leukemia	inhibitory	factor,	are	paired	with

gp130.	There	is	also	a	common	150-kDa	subunit	shared	by	IL-3,	IL-5,	
and	 granulocyte-macrophage	 colony-stimulating	 factor	 (GM-CSF)	
receptors.	The	gamma	chain	(γc)	of	the	IL-2	receptor	is	common	to	the	
IL-2,	IL-4,	IL-7,	IL-9,	and	IL-15	receptors.	Thus,	the	specific	cytokine	
receptor	is	responsible	for	ligand-specific	binding,	whereas	the	subun-
its	such	as	gp130,	the	150-kDa	subunit,	and	γc	are	important	in	signal	
transduction.	The	γc	gene	is	on	the	X	chromosome,	and	mutations	in	
the	γc	protein	result	in	the	X-linked form of severe combined immune 
deficiency syndrome (X-SCID)	(Chap. 351).

The	members	of	the	interferon (type II) receptor	family	include	the	
receptors	 for	 IFN-γ	 and	 -β,	 which	 share	 a	 similar	 210-amino-acid	
binding	domain	with	conserved	cysteine	pairs	at	both	the	amino	and	
carboxy	 termini.	 The	 members	 of	 the	 TNF  (type  III)  receptor  family	
share	a	common	binding	domain	composed	of	repeated	cysteine-rich	
regions.	Members	of	this	family	include	the	p55	and	p75	receptors	for	
TNF	(TNF-R1	and	TNF-R2,	respectively);	CD40	antigen,	which	is	an	
important	B-cell	surface	marker	involved	in	immunoglobulin	isotype	
switching;	 fas/Apo-1,	 whose	 triggering	 induces	 apoptosis;	 CD27	 and	
CD30,	 which	 are	 found	 on	 activated	 T	 cells	 and	 B	 cells;	 and	 nerve	
growth	factor	receptor.

The	 common	 motif	 for	 the	 seven  transmembrane  helix  family	 was	
originally	 found	 in	 receptors	 linked	 to	 GTP-binding	 proteins.	 This	
family	includes	receptors	for	chemokines	(Table	349-7),	β-adrenergic	
receptors,	and	retinal	rhodopsin.	It	is	important	to	note	that	two	mem-
bers	of	the	chemokine	receptor	family,	CXC	chemokine	receptor	type	
4	(CXCR4)	and	β	chemokine	receptor	type	5	(CCR5),	have	been	found	
to	serve	as	the	two	major	co-receptors	for	binding	and	entry	of	HIV-1	
into	CD4-expressing	host	cells	(Chap. 202).

Significant	 advances	 have	 been	 made	 in	 defining	 the	 signaling	
pathways	 through	 which	 cytokines	 exert	 their	 intracellular	 effects.	
The	 Janus	 family	 of	 protein	 tyrosine	 kinases	 (JAK)	 is	 a	 critical	 ele-
ment	involved	in	signaling	via	the	hematopoietin	receptors.	Four	JAK	
kinases,	 JAK1,	 JAK2,	 JAK3,	 and	 Tyk2,	 preferentially	 bind	 different	
cytokine	 receptor	 subunits.	 Cytokine	 binding	 to	 its	 receptor	 brings	
the	 cytokine	 receptor	 subunits	 into	 apposition	 and	 allows	 a	 pair	
of	 JAKs	 to	 transphosphorylate	 and	 activate	 one	 another.	 The	 JAKs	
then	 phosphorylate	 the	 receptor	 on	 the	 tyrosine	 residues	 and	 allow

ecules	become	phosphorylated.	Signaling	molecules	bind	the	receptor	
because	they	have	domains	(SH2,	or	src	homology	2	domains)	that	can	
bind	 phosphorylated	 tyrosine	 residues.	 There	 are	 a	 number	 of	 these	
important	signaling	molecules	that	bind	the	receptor,	such	as	the	adap-
ter	molecule	SHC,	which	can	couple	the	receptor	to	the	activation	of	
the	mitogen-activated	protein	kinase	pathway.	In	addition,	an	impor-
tant	class	of	substrate	of	the	JAKs	is	the	signal	transducers	and	activa-
tors	of	transcription	(STAT)	family	of	transcription	factors.	STATs	have	
SH2	 domains	 that	 enable	 them	 to	 bind	 to	 phosphorylated	 receptors,	
where	they	are	then	phosphorylated	by	the	JAKs.	It	appears	that	differ-
ent	STATs	have	specificity	for	different	receptor	subunits.	The	STATs	
then	dissociate	from	the	receptor	and	translocate	to	the	nucleus,	bind	
to	DNA	motifs	that	they	recognize,	and	regulate	gene	expression.	The	
STATs	preferentially	bind	DNA	motifs	that	are	slightly	different	from	
one	 another	 and	 thereby	 control	 transcription	 of	 specific	 genes.	 The	
importance	of	this	pathway	is	particularly	relevant	to	lymphoid	devel-
opment.	Mutations	of	JAK3	itself	also	result	in	a	disorder	identical	to	
X-SCID;	however,	because	JAK3	is	found	on	chromosome	19	and	not	
on	the	X	chromosome,	JAK3	deficiency	
occurs	in	boys	and	girls	(Chap. 351).

Mature	 T	 lymphocytes	 constitute	 70–80%	 of	 normal	 peripheral

In	lymph	nodes,	T	cells	occupy	deep	paracortical	areas	around	B-cell	
germinal	centers,	and	in	the	spleen,	they	are	located	in	periarteriolar	
areas	of	white	pulp	(Chap. 66).	T	cells	are	the	primary	effectors	of	cell-

 ■ THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE 
SYSTEM
Adaptive	immunity	is	characterized	by	
antigen-specific	 responses	 to	 a	 foreign	
antigen	 or	 pathogen.	 A	 key	 feature	 of	
adaptive	 immunity	 is	 that	 following	
the	initial	contact	with	antigen	(immu-
nologic  priming),	 subsequent	 antigen	
exposure	 leads	 to	 more	 rapid	 and	 vig-
orous	immune	responses	(immunologic 
memory).	The	adaptive	immune	system	
consists	 of	 dual	 limbs	 of	 cellular	 and	
humoral	immunity.	The	principal	effec-
tors	of	cellular	immunity	are	T	lympho-
cytes,	whereas	the	principal	effectors	of	
humoral	immunity	are	B	lymphocytes.	
Both	B	and	T	lymphocytes	derive	from	
a	common	stem	cell	(Fig. 349-6).

The	 proportion	 and	 distribution	 of	
immunocompetent	cells	in	various	tis-
sues	reflect	cell	traffic,	homing	patterns,	
and	 functional	 capabilities.	 Bone	 mar-
row	 is	 the	 major	 site	 of	 maturation	 of	
B	 cells,	 monocytes-macrophages,	 DCs,	
and	granulocytes	and	contains	pluripo-
tent	stem	cells	that,	under	the	influence	
of	 various	 colony-stimulating	 factors,	
can	 give	 rise	 to	 all	 hematopoietic	 cell	
types.	T-cell	precursors	also	arise	from	
hematopoietic	 stem	 cells	 and	 home	 to	
the	 thymus	 for	 maturation.	 Mature	 T	
lymphocytes,	 B	 lymphocytes,	 mono-
cytes,	and	DCs	enter	the	circulation	and	
home	 to	 peripheral	 lymphoid	 organs	
(lymph	 nodes,	 spleen)	 and	 mucosal	
surface-associated	
tissue	
(gut,	 genitourinary,	 and	 respiratory	
tracts)	 as	 well	 as	 the	 skin	 and	 mucous	
membranes	and	await	activation	by	for-
eign	antigen.

2690 cells.	 Central	 memory	 T	 cells	 home	 to	 lymphoid	 organs	 where	 they	
replenish	 long-	 and	 short-lived	 and	 effector	 memory	 T	 cells	 as		
needed.

In	general,	CD4+	T	cells	are	the	primary	regulatory	cells	of	T	and	B	
lymphocyte	and	monocyte	function	by	the	production	of	cytokines	and	
by	direct	cell	contact	(Fig.	349-2).	In	addition,	T	cells	regulate	erythroid	
cell	maturation	in	bone	marrow	and,	through	cell	contact	(CD40	lig-
and),	have	an	important	role	in	activation	of	B	cells	and	induction	of	Ig	
isotype	switching.	Considerable	evidence	now	exists	that	colonization	
of	the	gut	by	commensal	bacteria	(the	gut	microbiome)	is	responsible	
for	expansion	of	the	peripheral	CD4+	T-cell	compartment	in	normal	
children	and	adults.

Human	T	cells	express	cell-surface	proteins	that	mark	stages	of	intra-
thymic	T-cell	maturation	or	identify	specific	functional	subpopulations	of	
mature	T	cells.	Many	of	these	molecules	mediate	or	participate	in	impor-
tant	T-cell	functions	(Table	349-1,	Fig.	349-6,	Chap. 350).

The	earliest	identifiable	T-cell	precursors	in	bone	marrow	are	CD34+	
pro-T	 cells	 (i.e.,	 cells	 in	 which	 TCR	 genes	 are	 neither	 rearranged	 nor	
expressed).	In	the	thymus,	CD34+	T-cell	precursors	begin	cytoplasmic	
(c)	 synthesis	 of	 components	 of	 the	 CD3	 complex	 of	 TCR-associated	
molecules	(Fig.	349-6).	Within	T-cell	precursors,	TCR	for	antigen	gene	
rearrangement	 yields	 two	 T-cell	 lineages,	 expressing	 either	 TCR-αβ	
chains	or	TCR-γδ	chains.	T	cells	expressing	the	TCR-αβ	chains	consti-
tute	the	majority	of	peripheral	T	cells	in	blood,	lymph	node,	and	spleen	
and	 terminally	 differentiate	 into	 either	 CD4+	 or	 CD8+	 cells.	 Cells	
expressing	 TCR-γδ	 chains	 circulate	 as	 a	 minor	 population	 in	 blood;	
their	 functions,	 although	 not	 fully	 understood,	 have	 been	 postulated	
to	 be	 those	 of	 immune	 surveillance	 at	 epithelial	 surfaces	 and	 cellular	
defenses	against	mycobacterial	organisms	and	other	intracellular	bac-
teria	through	recognition	of	bacterial	lipids.

In	the	thymus,	the	recognition	of	self-peptides	on	thymic	epithelial	
cells,	thymic	macrophages,	and	DCs	plays	an	important	role	in	shaping	

T-cell	 repertoire.	 As	 immature	 cortical	 thymocytes	 begin	 to	 express	
surface	TCR	for	antigen,	thymocytes	with	TCRs	capable	of	interacting	
with	self-peptides	in	the	context	of	self-MHC	antigens	with	low	affinity	
are	activated	and	survive	(positive	selection).	Thymocytes	with	TCRs	
that	are	incapable	of	binding	to	self-MHC	antigens	or	bind	with	high	
affinity	die	of	attrition	(no	selection)	or	by	apoptosis	(negative	selec-
tion).	Thymocytes	that	are	positively	selected	undergo	maturation	into	
CD4	 or	 CD8	 single	 positive	 T	 cells,	 and	 then	 migrate	 to	 the	 thymus	
medulla	 where	 they	 interact	 with	 self-peptide–self-MHC	 molecules,	
where	they	can	again	undergo	selection.	The	purpose	of	negative	and	
positive	thymocyte	selection	is	to	eliminate	potential	pathogenic	auto-
reactive	T	cells,	and	at	the	same	time,	select	a	repertoire	of	mature	T	
cells	capable	of	recognizing	foreign	antigens.

Mature	TCRαβ	thymocytes	that	are	positively	selected	are	functional	
MHC	class	II–restricted	CD4+	T	cells	(Fig.	349-2),	or	they	are	CD8+	
T	cells	destined	to	become	CD8+	MHC	class	I–restricted	cytotoxic	T	
cells.	 MHC  class  I	 or	 class  II  restriction	 means	 that	 T	 cells	 recognize	
antigen	peptide	fragments	only	when	they	are	presented	in	the	antigen-	
recognition	 site	 of	 a	 class	 I	 or	 class	 II	 MHC	 molecule,	 respectively.	
After	thymocyte	maturation	and	selection,	CD4	and	CD8	thymocytes	
leave	the	thymus	and	migrate	to	the	peripheral	immune	system.	The	
thymus	can	continue	to	be	a	contributor	to	the	peripheral	immune	sys-
tem	well	into	adult	life,	both	normally	and	when	the	peripheral	T-cell	
pool	is	damaged,	such	as	occurs	in	AIDS	and	cancer	chemotherapy.

MOLECULAR BASIS OF T-CELL RECOGNITION OF ANTIGEN  The	TCR	
for	 antigen	 is	 a	 complex	 of	 molecules	 consisting	 of	 an	 antigen-	
binding	 heterodimer	 of	 either	 αβ	 or	 γδ	 chains	 noncovalently	 linked	
with	five	CD3	subunits	(γ,	δ,	ε,	ζ,	and	η)	(Fig. 349-7).	The	CD3	ζ	chains	
are	 either	 disulfide-linked	 homodimers	 (CD3-ζ2)	 or	 disulfide-linked	
heterodimers	 composed	 of	 one	 ζ	 chain	 and	 one	 η	 chain.	 TCR-αβ	 or	
TCR-γδ	 molecules	 must	 be	 associated	 with	 CD3	 molecules	 to	 be

FIGURE 349-7  Signaling through the T-cell receptor. Activation signals are mediated via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation (ITAM) sequences in LAT and CD3 
chains (blue bars) that bind to enzymes and transduce activation signals to the nucleus via the indicated intracellular activation pathways. Ligation of the T-cell receptor 
(TCR) by MHC complexed with antigen results in sequential activation of LCK and γ-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa (ZAP70). ZAP70 phosphorylates several 
downstream targets, including LAT (linker for activation of T cells) and SLP76 (SCR homology 2 [SH2] domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa). SLP76 is recruited 
to  membrane-bound  LAT  through  its  constitutive  interaction  with  GADS  (GRB2-related  adaptor  protein).  Together,  SLP76  and  LAT  nucleate  a  multimolecular  signaling 
complex, which induces a host of downstream responses, including calcium flux, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, integrin activation, and cytoskeletal 
reorganization. APC, antigen-presenting cell; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells. (Reproduced with permission from GA Koretzky, F Abtahian, MA Silverman. SLP76

inserted	 into	 the	 T-cell	 surface	 membrane,	 TCR-α	 being	 paired	 with	
TCR-β	 and	 TCR-γ	 being	 paired	 with	 TCR-δ.	 Molecules	 of	 the	 CD3	
complex	 mediate	 transduction	 of	 T-cell	 activation	 signals	 via	 TCRs,	
whereas	 TCR-α	 and	 -β	 or	 -γ	 and	 -δ	 molecules	 combine	 to	 form	 the	
TCR	antigen-binding	site.

The	 α,	 β,	 γ,	 and	 δ	 TCR	 for	 antigen	 molecules	 have	 amino	 acid	
sequence	 homology	 and	 structural	 similarities	 to	 immunoglobulin	
heavy	and	light	chains	and	are	members	of	the	immunoglobulin gene 
superfamily	 of	 molecules.	 The	 genes	 encoding	 TCR	 molecules	 are	
encoded	as	clusters	of	gene	segments	that	rearrange	during	T-cell	mat-
uration.	This	creates	an	efficient	and	compact	mechanism	for	housing	
the	diversity	requirements	of	antigen	receptor	molecules.	The	TCR-α	
chain	is	on	chromosome	14	and	consists	of	a	series	of	V	(variable),	J	
(joining),	and	C	(constant)	regions.	The	TCR-β	chain	is	on	chromo-
some	7	and	consists	of	multiple	V,	D	(diversity),	J,	and	C	TCR-β	loci.	
The	TCR-γ	chain	is	on	chromosome	7,	and	the	TCR-δ	chain	is	in	the	
middle	 of	 the	 TCR-α	 locus	 on	 chromosome	 14.	 Thus,	 molecules	 of	
the	TCR	for	antigen	have	constant	(framework)	and	variable	regions,	
and	 the	 gene	 segments	 encoding	 the	 α,	 β,	 γ,	 and	 δ	 chains	 of	 these	
molecules	are	recombined	and	selected	in	the	thymus,	culminating	in	
synthesis	of	the	completed	molecule.	In	both	T-	and	B-cell	precursors	
(see	below),	DNA	rearrangements	of	antigen	receptor	genes	involve	the	
same	 enzymes,	 recombinase	 activating	 gene	 RAG1	 and	 RAG2,	 both	
DNA-dependent	protein	kinases.

TCR	diversity	is	created	by	the	different	V,	D,	and	J	segments	that	are	
possible	for	each	receptor	chain	by	the	many	permutations	of	V,	D,	and	J	
segment	combinations,	by	“N-region	diversification”	due	to	the	addition	
of	nucleotides	at	the	junction	of	rearranged	gene	segments,	and	by	the	
pairing	of	individual	chains	to	form	a	TCR	dimer.	As	T	cells	mature	in	the	
thymus,	the	repertoire	of	antigen-reactive	T	cells	is	modified	by	selection	
processes	that	eliminate	many	autoreactive	T	cells,	enhance	the	prolifer-
ation	of	cells	that	function	appropriately	with	self-MHC	molecules	and	
antigen,	and	allow	T	cells	with	nonproductive	TCR	rearrangements	to	die.
TCR-αβ	 cells	 do	 not	 recognize	 native	 protein	 or	 carbohydrate	 anti-
gens.	Instead,	T	cells	recognize	only	short	(~9–13	amino	acids)	peptide	
fragments	derived	from	protein	antigens	taken	up	or	produced	in	APCs.		
Foreign	antigens	may	be	taken	up	by	endocytosis	into	acidified	intracellular	
vesicles	or	by	phagocytosis	and	degraded	into	small	peptides	that	associate	
with	MHC	class	II	molecules	(exogenous	antigen-presentation	pathway).	
Other	 foreign	 antigens	 arise	 endogenously	 in	 the	 cytosol	 (such	 as	 from	
replicating	viruses)	and	are	broken	down	into	small	peptides	that	associate	
with	MHC	class	I	molecules	(endogenous	antigen-presenting	pathway).	
Thus,	APCs	proteolytically	degrade	foreign	proteins	and	display	peptide	
fragments	embedded	in	the	MHC	class	I	or	II	antigen-recognition	site	
on	 the	 MHC	 molecule	 surface,	 where	 foreign	 peptide	 fragments	 are	
available	to	bind	to	TCR-αβ	or	TCR-γδ	chains	of	reactive	T	cells.	CD4	
molecules	act	as	adhesives	and,	by	direct	binding	to	MHC	class	II	(DR,	
DQ,	 or	 DP)	 molecules,	 stabilize	 the	 interaction	 of	 TCR	 with	 peptide	
antigen	(Fig.	349-7).	Similarly,	CD8	molecules	also	act	as	adhesives	to	
stabilize	the	TCR-antigen	interaction	by	direct	CD8	molecule	binding	
to	MHC	class	I	(A,	B,	or	C)	molecules.

Antigens	that	arise	in	the	cytosol	and	are	processed	via	the	endoge-
nous	antigen-presentation	pathway	are	cleaved	into	small	peptides	by	
a	 complex	 of	 proteases	 called	 the	 proteasome.	 From	 the	 proteasome,	
antigen	 peptide	 fragments	 are	 transported	 from	 the	 cytosol	 into	 the	
lumen	 of	 the	 endoplasmic	 reticulum	 by	 a	 heterodimeric	 complex	
termed	transporters associated with antigen processing	or	TAP	proteins.	
There,	 MHC	 class	 I	 molecules	 in	 the	 endoplasmic	 reticulum	 mem-
brane	physically	associate	with	processed	cytosolic	peptides.	Following	
peptide	association	with	class	I	molecules,	peptide–class	I	complexes	
are	exported	to	the	Golgi	apparatus,	and	then	to	the	cell	surface,	for	
recognition	by	CD8+	T	cells.

Antigens	 taken	 up	 from	 the	 extracellular	 space	 via	 endocytosis	
into	 intracellular	 acidified	 vesicles	 are	 degraded	 by	 vesicle	 proteases	
into	peptide	fragments.	Intracellular	vesicles	containing	MHC	class	II	
molecules	fuse	with	peptide-containing	vesicles,	thus	allowing	peptide	
fragments	to	physically	bind	to	MHC	class	II	molecules.	Peptide–MHC	
class	II	complexes	are	then	transported	to	the	cell	surface	for	recogni-
tion	by	CD4+	T	cells.

Whereas	it	is	generally	agreed	that	the	TCR-αβ	receptor	recognizes	
peptide	antigens	in	the	context	of	MHC	class	I	or	class	II	molecules,	
lipids	in	the	cell	wall	of	intracellular	bacteria	such	as	M. tuberculosis	
can	also	be	presented	to	a	wide	variety	of	T	cells,	including	subsets	of	
TCR-γδ	 T	 cells,	 and	 a	 subset	 of	 CD8+	 TCR-αβ	 T	 cells.	 Importantly,	
bacterial	lipid	antigens	are	not	presented	in	the	context	of	MHC	class	I	
or	II	molecules,	but	rather	are	presented	in	the	context	of	MHC-related	
CD1	molecules.	Some	γδ	T	cells	that	recognize	lipid	antigens	via	CD1	
molecules	have	very	restricted	TCR	usage,	do	not	need	antigen	prim-
ing	to	respond	to	bacterial	lipids,	and	may	be	a	form	of	innate	rather	
than	acquired	immunity	to	intracellular	bacteria.

Just	 as	 foreign	 antigens	 are	 degraded	 and	 their	 peptide	 fragments	
presented	in	the	context	of	MHC	class	I	or	class	II	molecules	on	APCs,	
endogenous	self-proteins	also	are	degraded,	and	self-peptide	fragments	
are	presented	to	T	cells	in	the	context	of	MHC	class	I	or	class	II	mole-
cules	on	APCs.	In	peripheral	lymphoid	organs,	there	are	T	cells	that	are	
capable	of	recognizing	self-protein	fragments	but	normally	are	anergic	
or	tolerant,	i.e.,	nonresponsive	to	self-antigenic	stimulation,	due	to	lack	
of	self-antigen	upregulating	APC	co-stimulatory molecules	such	as	B7-1	
(CD80)	and	B7-2	(CD86)	(see	below	and	Chap. 350).

Once	engagement	of	mature	T-cell	TCR	by	foreign	peptide	occurs	
in	 the	 context	 of	 self-MHC	 class	 I	 or	 class	 II	 molecules,	 binding	 of	
non-antigen-specific	adhesion	ligand	pairs	such	as	CD54-CD11/CD18	
and	CD58-CD2	stabilizes	MHC	peptide-TCR	binding,	and	the	expres-
sion	 of	 these	 adhesion	 molecules	 is	 upregulated	 (Fig.	 349-6).	 Once	
antigen	ligation	of	the	TCR	occurs,	the	T-cell	membrane	is	partitioned	
into	lipid membrane microdomains,	or	lipid rafts,	that	coalesce	the	key	
signaling	molecules	TCR/CD3	complex,	CD28,	CD2,	LAT	(linker	for	
activation	 of	 T	 cells),	 intracellular	 activated	 (dephosphorylated)	 src	
family	protein	tyrosine	kinases	(PTKs),	and	the	key	CD3ζ-associated	
protein-70	(ZAP-70)	PTK	(Fig.	349-7).	Importantly,	during	T-cell	acti-
vation,	the	CD45	molecule,	with	protein	tyrosine	phosphatase	activity,	
is	 partitioned	 away	 from	 the	 TCR	 complex	 to	 allow	 activating	 phos-
phorylation	 events	 to	 occur.	 The	 coalescence	 of	 signaling	 molecules	
of	activated	T	lymphocytes	in	microdomains	has	suggested	that	T	cell–
APC	interactions	can	be	considered	immunologic synapses,	analogous	
in	function	to	neuronal	synapses.

After	TCR-MHC	binding	is	stabilized,	activation	signals	are	trans-
mitted	 through	 the	 cell	 to	 the	 nucleus	 and	 lead	 to	 the	 expression	 of	
gene	 products	 important	 in	 mediating	 the	 wide	 diversity	 of	 T-cell	
functions	such	as	the	secretion	of	IL-2.	The	TCR	does	not	have	intrin-
sic	signaling	activity	but	is	linked	to	a	variety	of	signaling	pathways	via	
ITAMs	expressed	on	the	various	CD3	chains	that	bind	to	proteins	that	
mediate	signal	transduction.	Each	of	the	pathways	results	in	the	acti-
vation	of	particular	transcription	factors	that	control	the	expression	of	
cytokine	and	cytokine	receptor	genes.	Thus,	antigen-MHC	binding	to	
the	TCR	induces	the	activation	of	the	src	family	of	PTKs,	Fyn	and	Lck	
(Lck	is	associated	with	CD4	or	CD8	co-stimulatory	molecules);	phos-
phorylation	 of	 CD3ζ	 chain;	 activation	 of	 the	 related	 tyrosine	 kinases	
ZAP-70	and	Syk;	and	downstream	activation	of	the	calcium-dependent	
calcineurin	pathway,	the	ras	pathway,	and	the	protein	kinase	C	path-
way.	Each	of	these	pathways	leads	to	activation	of	specific	families	of	
transcription	 factors	 (including	 NF-AT,	 fos	 and	 jun,	 and	 rel/NF-κB)	
that	form	heteromultimers	capable	of	inducing	expression	of	IL-2,	IL-2	
receptor,	IL-4,	TNF-α,	and	other	T-cell	mediators.

In	addition	to	the	signals	delivered	to	the	T	cell	from	the	TCR	complex	
and	CD4	and	CD8,	molecules	on	the	T	cell,	such	as	CD28	and	inducible	
co-stimulator	(ICOS),	and	molecules	on	DCs,	such	as	B7-1	(CD80)	and	
B7-2	(CD86),	also	deliver	important	co-stimulatory	signals	that	upregu-
late	T-cell	cytokine	production	and	are	essential	for	T-cell	activation.	If	
signaling	through	CD28	or	ICOS	does	not	occur,	or	if	CD28	is	blocked,	
the	T	cell	becomes	anergic	rather	than	activated	(see	“Immune	Tolerance	
and	Autoimmunity”	below	and	Chap. 350).	CTLA-4	(CD152)	is	similar	
to	CD28	in	its	ability	to	bind	CD80	and	CD86.	Unlike	CD28,	CTLA-4	
transmits	an	inhibitory	signal	to	T	cells,	acting	as	an	off	switch.

2692 T-cell	 function,	 resulting	 in	 defects	 in	 memory	 T-cell	 responses.	 This	
has	been	defined	as	T-cell exhaustion	and	is	associated	with	T-cell	pro-
grammed	 cell	 death	 protein	 1	 (PD-1)	 (CD279)	 expression.	 Exhausted	
T	cells	have	compromised	proliferation	and	lose	the	ability	to	produce	
effector	 molecules,	 like	 IL-2,	 TNF-α,	 and	 IFN-γ.	 PD-1	 downregu-
lates	 T-cell	 responses	 and	 is	 associated	 with	 T-cell	 exhaustion	 and	
disease	 progression.	 For	 this	 reason,	 inhibition	 of	 T-cell	 PD-1	 activity	
to	 enhance	 effector	 T-cell	 function	 is	 being	 explored	 as	 a	 target	 for	
immunotherapy	 in	 both	 viral	 infections	 and	 certain	 malignancies	 
(Chap. 350).

T-CELL  SUPERANTIGENS  Conventional	 antigens	 bind	 to	 MHC	 class	
I	or	II	molecules	in	the	groove	of	the	αβ	heterodimer	and	bind	to	T	
cells	via	the	V	regions	of	the	TCR-α	and	-β	chains.	In	contrast,	super-
antigens	 bind	 directly	 to	 the	 lateral	 portion	 of	 the	 TCR-β	 chain	 and	
MHC	 class	 II	 β	 chain	 and	 stimulate	 T	 cells	 based	 solely	 on	 the	 Vβ	
gene	segment	used	independent	of	the	D,	J,	and	Vα	sequences	present.	
Superantigens	are	protein	molecules	capable	of	activating	up	to	20%	of	
the	peripheral	T-cell	pool,	whereas	conventional	antigens	activate	<1	in	
10,000	T	cells.	T-cell	superantigens	include	staphylococcal	enterotox-
ins	and	other	bacterial	products.	Superantigen	stimulation	of	human	
peripheral	T	cells	occurs	in	the	clinical	setting	of	staphylococcal toxic 
shock syndrome,	leading	to	massive	overproduction	of	T-cell	cytokines	
that	leads	to	hypotension	and	shock	(Chap. 147).

B CELLS  Mature	B	cells	constitute	5–10%	of	human	peripheral	blood	
lymphocytes,	 20–30%	 of	 lymph	 node	 cells,	 50%	 of	 splenic	 lympho-
cytes,	 and	 ~10%	 of	 bone	 marrow	 lymphocytes.	 B	 cells	 express	 on	
their	 surface	 intramembrane	 immunoglobulin	 (Ig)	 molecules	 that	
function	 as	 BCRs	 for	 antigen	 in	 a	 complex	 of	 Ig-associated	 α	 and	 β	

signaling	molecules	with	properties	similar	to	those	described	in	T	cells		
(Fig. 349-8).	 Unlike	 T	 cells,	 which	 recognize	 only	 processed	 peptide	
fragments	of	conventional	antigens	embedded	in	the	notches	of	MHC	
class	I	and	class	II	antigens	of	APCs,	B	cells	are	capable	of	recognizing	
and	 proliferating	 to	 whole	 unprocessed	 native	 antigens	 via	 antigen	
binding	to	B-cell	surface	Ig	(sIg)	receptors.	B	cells	also	express	surface	
receptors	for	the	Fc	region	of	IgG	molecules	(CD32)	as	well	as	receptors	
for	activated	complement	components	(C3d	or	CD21,	C3b	or	CD35).	
The	primary	function	of	B	cells	is	to	produce	antibodies.	B	cells	also	
serve	 as	 APCs	 and	 are	 highly	 efficient	 at	 antigen	 processing.	 Their	
antigen-presenting	 function	 is	 enhanced	 by	 a	 variety	 of	 cytokines.	
Mature	B	cells	are	derived	from	bone	marrow	precursor	cells	that	arise	
continuously	throughout	life	(Fig.	349-6).

B	 lymphocyte	 development	 can	 be	 separated	 into	 antigen-	
independent	 and	 antigen-dependent	 phases.	 Antigen-independent	
B-cell	development	occurs	in	primary	lymphoid	organs	and	includes	
all	stages	of	B-cell	maturation	up	to	the	sIg+	mature	B	cell.	Antigen-	
dependent	 B-cell	 maturation	 is	 driven	 by	 the	 interaction	 of	 antigen	
with	 the	 mature	 B-cell	 sIg,	 leading	 to	 memory	 B-cell	 induction,	 Ig	
class	switching,	and	plasma	cell	formation.	Antigen-dependent	stages	
of	 B-cell	 maturation	 occur	 in	 secondary	 lymphoid	 organs,	 including	
lymph	node,	spleen,	and	gut	Peyer’s	patches.	In	contrast	to	the	T-cell	
repertoire	that	is	generated	intrathymically	before	contact	with	foreign	
antigen,	 the	 repertoire	 of	 B	 cells	 expressing	 diverse	 antigen-reactive	
sites	 is	 modified	 by	 further	 alteration	 of	 Ig	 genes	 after	 stimulation	
by	 antigen—a	 process	 called	 somatic  hypermutation—that	 occurs	 in	
lymph	node	germinal	centers.

During	B-cell	development,	diversity	of	the	antigen-binding	variable	
region	of	Ig	is	generated	by	an	ordered	set	of	Ig	gene	rearrangements

FIGURE 349-8  B-cell receptor (BCR) activation results in the sequential activation of protein tyrosine kinases, which results in the formation of a signaling complex and

that	are	similar	to	the	rearrangements	undergone	by	TCR	α,	β,	γ,	and	
δ	genes.	For	the	heavy	chain,	there	is	first	a	rearrangement	of	D	seg-
ments	to	J	segments,	followed	by	a	second	rearrangement	between	a	V	
gene	segment	and	the	newly	formed	D-J	sequence;	the	C	segment	is	
aligned	to	the	V-D-J	complex	to	yield	a	functional	Ig	heavy	chain	gene	
(V-D-J-C).	During	later	stages,	a	functional	κ	or	γ	light	chain	gene	is	
generated	by	rearrangement	of	a	V	segment	to	a	J	segment,	ultimately	
yielding	an	intact	Ig	molecule	composed	of	heavy	and	light	chains.

The	 process	 of	 Ig	 gene	 rearrangement	 is	 regulated	 and	 results	 in	
a	 single	 antibody	 specificity	 produced	 by	 each	 B	 cell,	 with	 each	 Ig	
molecule	 comprising	 one	 type	 of	 heavy	 chain	 and	 one	 type	 of	 light	
chain.	Although	each	B	cell	contains	two	copies	of	Ig	light	and	heavy	
chain	genes,	only	one	gene	of	each	type	is	productively	rearranged	and	
expressed	in	each	B	cell,	a	process	termed	allelic exclusion.

There	are	~300	Vκ	genes	and	5	Jκ	genes,	resulting	in	the	pairing	of	Vκ	
and	Jκ	genes	to	create	>1500	different	kappa	light	chain	combinations.	
There	are	~70	Vλ	genes	and	4	Jλ	genes	for	>280	different	lambda	light	
chain	combinations.	The	number	of	distinct	light	chains	that	can	be	gen-
erated	is	increased	by	somatic	mutations	within	the	V	and	J	genes,	thus	
creating	large	numbers	of	possible	specificities	from	a	limited	amount	
of	germline	genetic	information.	As	noted	above,	in	heavy	chain	Ig	gene	
rearrangement,	the	VH	domain	is	created	by	the	joining	of	three	types	
of	germline	genes	called	VH,	DH,	and	JH,	thus	allowing	for	even	greater	
diversity	in	the	variable	region	of	heavy	chains	than	of	light	chains.

The	most	immature	B-cell	precursors	(early	pro-B	cells)	lack	cyto-
plasmic	Ig	(cIg)	and	sIg	(Fig.	349-6).	The	large	pre-B	cell	is	marked	by	
the	acquisition	of	the	surface	pre-BCR	composed	of	μ	heavy	(H)	chains	
and	a	pre-B	light	chain,	termed	V pre-B.	V	pre-B	is	a	surrogate	light	
chain	receptor	encoded	by	the	non-rearranged	V	pre-B	and	the	γ5	light	
chain	locus	(the	pre-BCR).	Pro-	and	pre-B	cells	are	driven	to	proliferate	
and	mature	by	signals	from	bone	marrow	stroma—in	particular,	IL-7.	
Light	 chain	 rearrangement	 occurs	 in	 the	 small	 pre-B-cell	 stage	 such	
that	 the	 full	 BCR	 is	 expressed	 at	 the	 immature	 B-cell	 stage.	 Imma-
ture	 B	 cells	 have	 rearranged	 Ig	 light	 chain	 genes	 and	 express	 sIgM.	
As	immature	B	cells	develop	into	mature	B	cells,	sIgD	is	expressed	as	
well	as	sIgM.	At	this	point,	B	lineage	development	in	bone	marrow	is	
complete,	and	B	cells	exit	into	the	peripheral	circulation	and	migrate	to	
secondary	lymphoid	organs	to	encounter	specific	antigens.

Random	 rearrangements	 of	 Ig	 genes	 occasionally	 generate	 self-	
reactive	antibodies,	and	mechanisms	must	be	in	place	to	correct	these	
mistakes.	One	such	mechanism	is	BCR	editing,	whereby	autoreactive	
BCRs	 are	 mutated	 to	 not	 react	 with	 self-antigens.	 If	 receptor	 editing	
is	unsuccessful	in	eliminating	autoreactive	B	cells,	then	autoreactive	B	
cells	undergo	negative	selection	in	the	bone	marrow	through	induction	
of	apoptosis	after	BCR	engagement	of	self-antigen.

After	 leaving	 the	 bone	 marrow,	 B	 cells	 populate	 peripheral	 B-cell	
sites,	such	as	lymph	node	and	spleen,	and	await	contact	with	foreign	
antigens	 that	 react	 with	 each	 B	 cell’s	 clonotypic	 receptor.	 Antigen-
driven	B-cell	activation	occurs	through	the	BCR,	and	a	process	known	
as	 somatic  hypermutation	 takes	 place	 whereby	 point	 mutations	 in	
rearranged	 H-	 and	 L-genes	 give	 rise	 to	 mutant	 sIg	 molecules,	 some	
of	which	bind	antigen	better	than	the	original	sIg	molecules.	Somatic	
hypermutation,	 therefore,	 is	 a	 process	 whereby	 memory	 B	 cells	 in	
peripheral	lymph	organs	have	the	best	binding	or	the	highest-affinity	
antibodies.	 This	 overall	 process	 of	 generating	 the	 best	 antibodies	 is	
called	affinity maturation of antibody.

Lymphocytes	 that	 synthesize	 IgG,	 IgA,	 and	 IgE	 are	 derived	 from	
sIgM+,	 sIgD+	 mature	 B	 cells.	 Ig	 class	 switching	 occurs	 in	 lymph	 node		
and	other	peripheral	lymphoid	tissue	germinal	centers.	CD40	on	B	cells	
and	CD40	ligand	on	T	cells	constitute	a	critical	co-stimulatory	receptor-	
ligand	pair	of	immune-stimulatory	molecules.	Pairs	of	CD40+	B	cells	
and	CD40	ligand+	T	cells	bind	and	drive	B-cell	Ig	class	switching	via		
T	cell–produced	cytokines	such	as	IL-4	and	TGF-β.	IL-1,	-2,	-4,	-5,	and	
-6	synergize	to	drive	mature	B	cells	to	proliferate	and	differentiate	into	
Ig-secreting	cells.

Humoral Mediators of Adaptive Immunity: Immunoglobulins 	
Immunoglobulins	are	the	products	of	differentiated	B	cells	and	mediate	
the	humoral	arm	of	the	immune	response.	The	primary	functions	of	
antibodies	are	to	bind	specifically	to	antigen	and	bring	about	the	inac-
tivation	or	removal	of	the	offending	toxin,	microbe,	parasite,	or	other	
foreign	substance	from	the	body.	The	structural	basis	of	Ig	molecule	
function	 and	 Ig	 gene	 organization	 has	 provided	 insight	 into	 the	 role	
of	 antibodies	 in	 normal	 protective	 immunity,	 pathologic	 immune-
mediated	damage	by	immune	complexes,	and	autoantibody	formation	
against	host	determinants.

All	 immunoglobulins	 have	 the	 basic	 structure	 of	 two	 heavy	 and	
two	 light	 chains	 (Fig.	 349-8).	 Immunoglobulin	 isotype	 (i.e.,	 G,	 M,	
A,	 D,	 E)	 is	 determined	 by	 the	 type	 of	 Ig	 heavy	 chain	 present.	 IgG	
and	 IgA	 isotypes	 can	 be	 divided	 further	 into	 subclasses	 (G1,	 G2,	
G3,	 G4,	 and	 A1,	 A2)	 based	 on	 specific	 antigenic	 determinants	 on	
Ig	heavy	chains.	The	characteristics	of	human	immunoglobulins	are	
outlined	 in	 Table  349-9.	 The	 four	 chains	 are	 covalently	 linked	 by	
disulfide	bonds.	Each	chain	is	made	up	of	a	V	region	and	C	regions	
(also	 called	 domains),	 themselves	 made	 up	 of	 units	 of	 ~110	 amino	
acids.	Light	chains	have	one	variable	(VL)	and	one	constant	(CL)	unit;	
heavy	chains	have	one	variable	unit	(VH)	and	three	or	four	constant	
(CH)	units,	depending	on	isotype.	As	the	name	suggests,	the	constant,	
or	C,	regions	of	Ig	molecules	are	made	up	of	homologous	sequences	
and	 share	 the	 same	 primary	 structure	 as	 all	 other	 Ig	 chains	 of	 the

2694 same	isotype	and	subclass.	Constant	regions	are	involved	in	biologic	
functions	of	Ig	molecules.	The	CH2	domain	of	IgG	and	the	CH4	units	
of	IgM	are	involved	with	the	binding	of	the	C1q	portion	of	C1	during	
complement	activation.	The	CH	region	at	the	carboxy-terminal	end	of	
the	IgG	molecule,	the	Fc	region,	binds	to	surface	Fc	receptors	(CD16,	
CD32,	 CD64)	 of	 macrophages,	 DCs,	 NK	 cells,	 B	 cells,	 neutrophils,	
and	eosinophils.	The	Fc	of	IgA	binds	to	FcαR	(CD89),	and	the	Fc	of	
IgE	binds	to	FcεR	(CD23).

Variable	regions	(VL	and	VH)	constitute	the	antibody-binding	(Fab)	
region	of	the	molecule.	Within	the	VL	and	VH	regions	are	hypervariable	
regions	 (extreme	 sequence	 variability)	 that	 constitute	 the	 antigen-	
binding	site	unique	to	each	Ig	molecule.	The	idiotype	is	defined	as	the	
specific	region	of	the	Fab	portion	of	the	Ig	molecule	to	which	antigen	
binds.	Antibodies	against	the	idiotype	portion	of	an	antibody	molecule	
are	called	anti-idiotype antibodies.	The	formation	of	such	antibodies	in	
vivo	during	a	normal	B-cell	antibody	response	may	generate	a	negative	
(or	“off ”)	signal	to	B	cells	to	terminate	antibody	production.

IgG	constitutes	~75–85%	of	total	serum	immunoglobulin.	The	four	
IgG	 subclasses	 are	 numbered	 in	 order	 of	 their	 level	 in	 serum,	 IgG1	
being	 found	 in	 greatest	 amounts	 and	 IgG4	 the	 least.	 IgG	 subclasses	
have	 clinical	 relevance	 in	 their	 varying	 ability	 to	 bind	 macrophage	
and	neutrophil	Fc	receptors	and	to	activate	complement	(Table	349-9).	
Moreover,	 selective	 deficiencies	 of	 certain	 IgG	 subclasses	 give	 rise	 to	
clinical	syndromes	in	which	the	patient	is	inordinately	susceptible	to	
bacterial	 infections.	 IgG	 antibodies	 are	 frequently	 the	 predominant	
antibody	 made	 after	 rechallenge	 of	 the	 host	 with	 antigen	 (secondary	
antibody	response).

IgM	 antibodies	 normally	 circulate	 as	 a	 950-kDa	 pentamer	 with	
160-kDa	bivalent	monomers	joined	by	a	molecule	called	the	J chain,	a	
15-kDa	nonimmunoglobulin	molecule	that	also	effects	polymerization	
of	 IgA	 molecules.	 IgM	 is	 the	 first	 immunoglobulin	 to	 appear	 in	 the	
immune	response	(primary	antibody	response)	and	is	the	initial	type	
of	antibody	made	by	neonates.	Membrane	IgM	in	the	monomeric	form	
also	functions	as	a	major	antigen	receptor	on	the	surface	of	mature	B	
cells	(Table	349-9).	IgM	is	an	important	component	of	immune	com-
plexes	 in	 autoimmune	 diseases.	 For	 example,	 IgM	 antibodies	 against	
IgG	molecules	(rheumatoid	factors)	are	present	in	high	titers	in	rheu-
matoid arthritis,	other	collagen	diseases,	and	some	infectious	diseases	
(subacute bacterial endocarditis).

IgA	constitutes	only	7–15%	of	total	serum	immunoglobulin	but	is	the	
predominant	class	of	immunoglobulin	in	secretions.	IgA	in	secretions	
(tears,	saliva,	nasal	secretions,	gastrointestinal	tract	fluid,	and	human	
milk)	is	in	the	form	of	secretory	IgA	(sIgA),	a	polymer	consisting	of	
two	IgA	monomers,	a	joining	molecule,	again	termed	the	J	chain,	and	
a	glycoprotein	called	the	secretory protein.	Of	the	two	IgA	subclasses,	
IgA1	is	primarily	found	in	serum,	whereas	IgA2	is	more	prevalent	in	
secretions.	IgA	fixes	complement	via	the	alternative	complement	path-
way	and	has	potent	antiviral	activity	in	humans	by	prevention	of	virus	
binding	to	respiratory	and	gastrointestinal	epithelial	cells.

IgD	is	found	in	minute	quantities	in	serum	and,	together	with	IgM,	
is	a	major	receptor	for	antigen	on	the	naïve	B-cell	surface.	IgE,	which	is	
present	in	serum	in	very	low	concentrations,	is	the	major	class	of	immu-
noglobulin	involved	in	arming	mast	cells	and	basophils	by	binding	to	
these	cells	via	the	Fc	region.	Antigen	cross-linking	of	IgE	molecules	on	
basophil	 and	 mast	 cell	 surfaces	 results	 in	 release	 of	 mediators	 of	 the	
immediate	hypersensitivity	(allergic)	response	(Table	349-9).

 ■ CELLULAR INTERACTIONS IN REGULATION OF 
NORMAL IMMUNE RESPONSES
The	net	result	of	activation	of	the	humoral	(B-cell)	and	cellular	(T-cell)	
arms	of	the	adaptive	immune	system	by	foreign	antigen	is	the	elimina-
tion	of	antigen	directly	by	specific	effector	T	cells	or	in	concert	with	
specific	antibody.

The	 expression	 of	 adaptive	 immune	 cell	 function	 is	 the	 result	 of	
a	 complex	 series	 of	 immunoregulatory	 events	 that	 occur	 in	 phases.	
Both	 T	 and	 B	 lymphocytes	 mediate	 immune	 functions,	 and	 each	 of	
these	cell	types,	when	given	appropriate	signals,	passes	through	stages,	
from	 activation	 and	 induction	 through	 proliferation,	 differentiation,	
and	ultimately	effector	functions.	The	effector	function	expressed	may	

be	at	the	end	point	of	a	response,	such	as	secretion	of	antibody	by	a	
differentiated	plasma	cell,	or	it	might	serve	a	regulatory	function	that	
modulates	 other	 functions,	 such	 as	 is	 seen	 with	 CD4+	 and	 CD8+	 T	
lymphocytes	that	modulate	both	differentiation	of	B	cells	and	activa-
tion	of	CD8+	cytotoxic	T	cells.

CD4	helper	T	cells	can	be	subdivided	on	the	basis	of	cytokines	produced	
(Fig.	349-2).	Activated	TH1-type	helper	T	cells	secrete	IL-2,	IFN-γ,	IL-3,	
TNF-α,	GM-CSF,	and	TNF-β,	whereas	activated	TH2-type	helper	T	cells	
secrete	IL-3,	-4,	-5,	-6,	-10,	and	-13.	TH1	CD4+	T	cells,	through	elab-
oration	 of	 IFN-γ,	 have	 a	 central	 role	 in	 mediating	 intracellular	 killing	
by	a	variety	of	pathogens.	TH1	CD4+	T	cells	also	provide	T-cell	help	for	
generation	of	cytotoxic	T	cells	and	some	types	of	opsonizing	antibody,	
and	they	generally	respond	to	antigens	that	lead	to	delayed	hypersen-
sitivity	 types	 of	 immune	 responses	 for	 many	 intracellular	 viruses	 and	
bacteria	(such	as	HIV-1	or	M. tuberculosis).	In	contrast,	TH2	cells	have	
a	primary	role	in	regulatory	humoral	immunity	and	isotype	switching.	
TH2	cells,	through	production	of	IL-4	and	IL-10,	have	a	regulatory	role	in	
limiting	 proinflammatory	 responses	 mediated	 by	 TH1	 cells	 (Fig.	 349-2).	
In	 addition,	 TH2	 CD4+	 T	 cells	 provide	 help	 to	 B	 cells	 for	 specific	 Ig	
production	 and	 respond	 to	 antigens	 that	 require	 high	 antibody	 levels	
for	foreign	antigen	elimination	(extracellular	encapsulated	bacteria	such	
as	 S.  pneumoniae	 and	 certain	 parasite	 infections).	 Additional	 subsets	
of	the	CD4	TH	cells	have	been	described,	one	of	which	is	termed	TH17,	
that	secrete	cytokines	IL-17,	-22,	and	-26.	TH17	cells	have	been	shown	
to	 play	 a	 role	 in	 autoimmune	 inflammatory	 disorders	 in	 addition	 to	
defense	against	extracellular	bacteria	and	fungi,	particularly	at	mucosal	
surfaces.	TH9	cells	are	defined	by	their	secretion	of	IL-9	and	have	been	
shown	 to	 play	 a	 role	 in	 atopic	 disease,	 inflammatory	 bowel	 disease,	
and	antitumor	immunity.	Moreover,	the	Tfh	subset	of	helper	T	cells	is	
crucial	for	providing	the	necessary	signals	to	B	cells	in	germinal	centers	
to	undergo	affinity	maturation.	A	subset	of	Tfh	cells	called	Tfh13	cells	
secrete	IL-4,	IL-5,	and	IL-13	in	response	to	allergens	and	mediate	ana-
phylaxis	reactions	(Fig.	349-2).	In	summary,	the	type	of	T-cell	response	
generated	in	an	immune	response	is	determined	by	the	microbe	PAMPs	
presented	to	the	DCs,	the	TLRs	on	the	DCs	that	become	activated,	the	
types	 of	 DCs	 that	 are	 activated,	 and	 the	 cytokines	 that	 are	 produced	
(Table	349-6).	Commonly,	myeloid	DCs	produce	IL-12	and	activate	TH1	
T-cell	responses	that	result	in	IFN-γ	and	cytotoxic	T-cell	induction,	and	
plasmacytoid	DCs	produce	IFN-α	and	lead	to	TH2	responses	that	result	
in	IL-4	production	and	enhanced	antibody	responses.

As	shown	in	Fig.	349-2,	upon	activation	by	DCs,	T-cell	subsets	that	
produce	IL-2,	IL-3,	IFN-γ,	and/or	IL-4,	-5,	-6,	-10,	and	-13	are	gen-
erated	and	exert	positive	and	negative	influences	on	effector	T	and	B	
cells.	For	B	cells,	trophic	effects	are	mediated	by	a	variety	of	cytokines,	
particularly	T	cell–derived	IL-3,	-4,	-5,	and	-6,	that	act	at	sequential	
stages	of	B-cell	maturation,	resulting	in	B-cell	proliferation,	differenti-
ation,	and	ultimately	antibody	secretion.	For	cytotoxic	T	cells,	trophic	
factors	include	inducer	T-cell	secretion	of	IL-2,	IFN-γ,	and	IL-12.

Important	types	of	immunomodulatory	T	cells	that	control	immune	
responses	are	CD4+ and CD8+ T regulatory cells.	These	cells	express	
the	α	chain	of	the	IL-2	receptor	(CD25),	produce	IL-10,	and	suppress	
both	 T-	 and	 B-cell	 responses.	 T	 regulatory	 cells	 (Tregs)	 are	 induced	
by	immature	DCs	and	play	key	roles	in	maintaining	tolerance	to	self-	
antigens.	 Loss	 of	 Treg	 cells	 is	 the	 cause	 of	 organ-specific	 autoim-
mune	 disease	 in	 mice	 such	 as	 autoimmune	 thyroiditis,	 adrenalitis,	
and	 oophoritis	 (see	 “Immune	 Tolerance	 and	 Autoimmunity”	 below,	
Chap. 350).	Tregs	also	play	key	roles	in	controlling	the	magnitude	and	
duration	of	immune	responses	to	microbes.	Normally,	after	the	initial	
immune	response	to	a	microbe	has	eliminated	the	invader,	Tregs	are	
activated	to	suppress	the	antimicrobe	response	and	prevent	host	injury.	
Some	 microbes	 have	 adapted	 to	 induce	 Treg	 activation	 at	 the	 site	 of	
infection	 to	 promote	 parasite	 infection	 and	 survival.	 In	 Leishmania	
infection,	the	parasite	induces	Treg	accumulation	at	skin	infection	sites	
that	 dampens	 anti-Leishmania	 T-cell	 responses	 and	 prevents	 parasite	
elimination.	Although	B	cells	recognize	native	antigen	via	B-cell	sur-
face	 Ig	 receptors,	 B	 cells	 require	 T-cell	 help	 to	 produce	 high-affinity	
antibody	of	multiple	isotypes	that	are	the	most	effective	in	eliminating	
foreign	antigen.	In	B	cell	germinal	centers,	the	CD4	T	cells	that	pro-
mote	B	cell	maturation	and	affinity	maturation	are	termed	T	follicular

helper	(Tfh)	cells.	T	cell–B	cell	interactions	that	lead	to	high-affinity	
antibody	production	require	(1)	processing	of	native	antigen	by	B	cells	
and	expression	of	peptide	fragments	on	the	B-cell	surface	for	presen-
tation	to	TH	cells,	(2)	the	ligation	of	B	cells	by	both	the	TCR	complex	
and	 the	 CD40	 ligand,	 (3)	 induction	 of	 the	 process	 termed	 antibody 
isotype switching	in	antigen-specific	B-cell	clones,	and	(4)	induction	of	
the	process	of	affinity	maturation	of	antibody	in	the	germinal	centers	
of	B-cell	follicles	of	lymph	node	and	spleen.

Naïve	B	cells	express	cell-surface	IgD	and	IgM,	and	initial	contact	
of	naïve	B	cells	with	antigen	is	via	binding	of	native	antigen	to	B-cell	
surface	IgM.	T-cell	cytokines,	released	following	TH2	cell	contact	with	
B	cells	or	by	a	“bystander”	effect,	induce	changes	in	Ig	gene	conforma-
tion	that	promote	recombination	of	Ig	genes.	These	events	then	result	
in	 the	 switching	 of	 expression	 of	 heavy	 chain	 exons	 in	 a	 triggered	 B	
cell,	leading	to	the	secretion	of	IgG,	IgA,	or,	in	some	cases,	IgE	antibody	
with	the	same	V	region	antigen	specificity	as	the	original	IgM	antibody,	
for	response	to	a	wide	variety	of	extracellular	bacteria,	protozoa,	and	
helminths.	 CD40	 ligand	 expression	 by	 activated	 T	 cells	 is	 critical	 for	
induction	of	B-cell	antibody	isotype	switching	and	for	B-cell	respon-
siveness	 to	 cytokines.	 Patients	 with	 mutations	 in	 T-cell	 CD40	 ligand	
have	 B	 cells	 that	 are	 unable	 to	 undergo	 isotype	 switching,	 resulting	
in	lack	of	memory	B-cell	generation	and	the	immunodeficiency	syn-
drome	of	X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome	(Chaps. 350 and 351).

 ■ IMMUNE TOLERANCE AND AUTOIMMUNITY
Immune tolerance	is	defined	as	the	absence	of	activation	of	pathogenic	
autoreactivity	 to	 self-antigens.	 Autoimmune  diseases	 are	 syndromes	
caused	by	the	activation	of	T	or	B	cells	or	both,	with	no	evidence	of	
other	causes	such	as	infections	or	malignancies	(Chaps. 350 and 355).	
Immune	tolerance	and	autoimmunity	are	present	normally	in	health;	
when	 abnormal,	 they	 represent	 extremes	 from	 the	 normal	 state.	 For	
example,	low	levels	of	autoreactivity	of	T	and	B	cells	with	self-antigens	
in	 the	 periphery	 are	 critical	 to	 T-	 and	 B-cell	 survival.	 Similarly,	 low	
levels	 of	 autoreactivity	 and	 thymocyte	 recognition	 of	 self-antigens	
in	 the	 thymus	 are	 the	 mechanisms	 whereby	 normal	 T	 cells	 are	 posi-
tively	selected	to	survive	and	leave	the	thymus	to	respond	to	foreign	
microbes	in	the	periphery	and	T	cells	highly	reactive	to	self-antigens	
are	 negatively	 selected	 and	 die	 to	 prevent	 overly	 self-reactive	 T	 cells	
from	 migrating	 to	 the	 periphery	 (central	 tolerance).	 However,	 not	
all	 self-antigens	 are	 expressed	 in	 the	 thymus	 to	 delete	 highly	 self-	
reactive	T	cells,	and	there	are	mechanisms	for	induction	of	tolerance	
in	peripheral	T	cells	as	well.	Unlike	the	presentation	of	microbial	anti-
gens	 by	 mature	 DCs,	 the	 presentation	 of	 self-antigens	 by	 immature	
DCs	 neither	 activates	 nor	 matures	 the	 DCs	 to	 express	 high	 levels	 of	
co-stimulatory	molecules	such	as	B7-1	(CD80)	or	B7-2	(CD86).	When	
peripheral	T	cells	are	stimulated	by	DCs	expressing	self-antigens	in	the	
context	of	HLA	molecules,	sufficient	stimulation	of	T	cells	occurs	to	
keep	them	alive,	but	otherwise,	they	remain	anergic,	or	nonresponsive,	
until	T	cells	contact	a	DC	with	high	levels	of	co-stimulatory	molecules	
expressing	microbial	antigens	and	become	activated	to	respond	to	the	
microbe.	If	B	cells	have	high	self-reactive	BCRs,	they	normally	undergo	
either	 deletion	 in	 the	 bone	 marrow	 or	 receptor	 editing	 to	 express	 a	
less	 autoreactive	 receptor.	 Although	 many	 autoimmune	 diseases	 are	
characterized	 by	 abnormal	 or	 pathogenic	 autoantibody	 production	 
(Table 349-10),	most	autoimmune	diseases	are	caused	by	a	combina-
tion	of	excess	T-	and	B-cell	reactivity.

Multiple	factors	contribute	to	the	genesis	of	autoimmune	disease	syn-
dromes,	 including	 genetic	 susceptibility	 (e.g.	 HLAB27	 with	 ankylosing	
spondylitis),	 environmental	 immune	 stimulants	 such	 as	 drugs	 (e.g.,	 pro-
cainamide	 and	 phenytoin	 [Dilantin]	 with	 drug-induced	 systemic	 lupus	
erythematosus),	 infectious	 agent	 triggers	 (such	 as	 Epstein-Barr	 virus	 and	
autoantibody	production	against	red	blood	cells	and	platelets),	and	loss	of	T	
regulatory	cells	(leading	to	thyroiditis,	adrenalitis,	and	oophoritis).

Immunity at Mucosal Surfaces  Mucosa	covering	the	respiratory,	
digestive,	and	urogenital	tracts;	the	eye	conjunctiva;	the	inner	ear;	and	
the	ducts	of	all	exocrine	glands	contain	cells	of	the	innate	and	adaptive	
mucosal	immune	system	that	protect	these	surfaces	against	pathogens.	
In	 the	 healthy	 adult,	 mucosa-associated	 lymphoid	 tissue	 (MALT)	

contains	80%	of	all	immune	cells	within	the	body	and	constitutes	the	
largest	mammalian	lymphoid	organ	system.

MALT	has	three	main	functions:	(1)	to	protect	the	mucous	mem-
branes	from	invasive	pathogens;	(2)	to	prevent	uptake	of	foreign	anti-
gens	 from	 food,	 commensal	 organisms,	 and	 airborne	 pathogens	 and	
particulate	 matter;	 and	 (3)	 to	 prevent	 pathologic	 immune	 responses	
from	foreign	antigens	if	they	do	cross	the	mucosal	barriers	of	the	body.
MALT	is	a	compartmentalized	system	of	immune	cells	that	functions	
independently	 from	 systemic	 immune	 organs.	 Whereas	 the	 systemic	
immune	 organs	 are	 essentially	 sterile	 under	 normal	 conditions	 and	
respond	vigorously	to	pathogens,	MALT	immune	cells	are	continuously	
bathed	 in	 foreign	 proteins	 and	 commensal	 bacteria,	 and	 they	 must	
select	those	pathogenic	antigens	that	must	be	eliminated.	MALT	con-
tains	anatomically	defined	foci	of	immune	cells	in	the	intestine,	tonsil,	
appendix,	and	peribronchial	areas	that	are	inductive	sites	for	mucosal	
immune	 responses.	 From	 these	 sites,	 immune	 T	 and	 B	 cells	 migrate	
to	 effector	 sites	 in	 mucosal	 parenchyma	 and	 exocrine	 glands	 where	
mucosal	immune	cells	eliminate	pathogen-infected	cells.	In	addition	to	
mucosal	immune	responses,	all	mucosal	sites	have	strong	mechanical	
and	chemical	barriers	and	cleansing	functions	to	repel	pathogens.

Key	components	of	MALT	include	specialized	epithelial	cells	called	
“membrane”	 or	 “M”	 cells	 that	 take	 up	 antigens	 and	 deliver	 them	 to	
DCs	or	other	APCs.	Effector	cells	in	MALT	include	B	cells	producing	
antipathogen	 neutralizing	 antibodies	 of	 secretory	 IgA	 as	 well	 as	 IgG	
isotype,	 T	 cells	 producing	 similar	 cytokines	 as	 in	 systemic	 immune	
system	 response,	 and	 T	 helper	 and	 cytotoxic	 T	 cells	 that	 respond	 to	
pathogen-infected	cells.

Secretory	IgA	is	produced	in	amounts	of	>50	mg/kg	of	body	weight	
per	24	h	and	functions	to	inhibit	bacterial	adhesion,	inhibit	macromol-
ecule	 absorption	 in	 the	 gut,	 neutralize	 viruses,	 and	 enhance	 antigen	
elimination	 in	 tissue	 through	 binding	 to	 IgA	 and	 receptor-mediated	
transport	of	immune	complexes	through	epithelial	cells.

Recent	studies	have	demonstrated	the	importance	of	commensal	gut	
and	other	mucosal	bacteria	to	the	health	of	the	human	immune	system.	
Normal	commensal	flora	induces	anti-inflammatory	events	in	the	gut	
and	protects	epithelial	cells	from	pathogens	through	TLRs	and	other	
PRR	signaling.	When	the	gut	is	depleted	of	normal	commensal	flora,	
the	immune	system	becomes	abnormal,	with	loss	of	TH1	T-cell	func-
tion.	Restoration	of	the	normal	gut	flora	can	reestablish	the	balance	in	
T	helper	cell	ratios	characteristic	of	the	normal	immune	system.	Diet	
also	has	an	impact	on	the	gut	microbiome.	Altered	microbiome	com-
position	has	been	etiologically	related	to	obesity,	insulin	resistance,	and	
diabetes.	When	the	gut	barrier	is	intact,	either	antigens	do	not	trans-
verse	the	gut	epithelium	or,	when	pathogens	are	present,	a	self-limited,	
protective	MALT	immune	response	eliminates	the	pathogen	(Fig.	349-8).	
However,	 when	 the	 gut	 barrier	 breaks	 down,	 immune	 responses	 to	
commensal	flora	antigens	can	cause	inflammatory	bowel	diseases	such	
as	Crohn’s disease	and,	perhaps,	ulcerative colitis	(Chap. 326).	Uncon-
trolled	MALT	immune	responses	to	food	antigens,	such	as	gluten,	can	
cause	celiac disease	(Chap. 326).

 ■ THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR CONTROL OF 
PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH
The	process	of	apoptosis	(programmed	cell	death)	plays	a	crucial	role	
in	regulating	normal	immune	responses	to	antigen.	In	general,	a	wide	
variety	of	stimuli	trigger	one	of	several	apoptotic	pathways	to	eliminate	
microbe-infected	 cells,	 eliminate	 cells	 with	 damaged	 DNA,	 or	 elim-
inate	 activated	 immune	 cells	 that	 are	 no	 longer	 needed	 (Fig. 349-9).	
The	 largest	 known	 family	 of	 “death	 receptors”	 is	 the	 TNF	 receptor	
(TNF-R)	 family	 (TNF-R1,	 TNF-R2,	 Fas	 [CD95],	 death	 receptor	 3	
[DR3],	death	receptor	4	[DR4;	TNF-related	apoptosis-including	ligand	
receptor	 1,	 or	 TRAIL-R1],	 and	 death	 receptor	 5	 [DR5,	 TRAIL-R2]);	
their	ligands	are	all	in	the	TNF-α	family.	Binding	of	ligands	to	these	
death	 receptors	 leads	 to	 a	 signaling	 cascade	 that	 involves	 activation	
of	the	caspase	family	of	molecules	that	leads	to	DNA	cleavage	and	cell	
death.	Two	other	pathways	of	programmed	cell	death	involve	nuclear	
p53	in	the	elimination	of	cells	with	abnormal	DNA	and	mitochondrial 
cytochrome c	to	induce	cell	death	in	damaged	cells	(Fig.	349-9).	A	num-
ber	of	human	diseases	have	now	been	described	that	result	from,	or	are

 ■ MECHANISMS OF IMMUNE-MEDIATED DAMAGE 
TO MICROBES OR HOST TISSUES
Several  responses  by  the  host  innate  and  adaptive  immune  systems 
to  foreign  microbes  culminate  in  rapid  and  efficient  elimination  of 

microbes.  In  these  scenarios,  the  classic  weapons  of  the  adaptive 
immune  system  (T  cells,  B  cells)  interface  with  cells  (macrophages, 
DCs, NK cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and soluble prod-
ucts  (microbial  peptides,  pentraxins,  complement  and  coagulation 
systems) of the innate immune system (Chaps. 64 and 352).

There  are  five  general  phases  of  host  defenses:  (1)  migration  of 
leukocytes  to  sites  of  antigen  localization;  (2)  antigen-nonspecific 
recognition  of  pathogens  by  macrophages  and  other  cells  and  sys-
tems of the innate immune system; (3) specific recognition of foreign

FIGURE 349-9  Pathways of cellular apoptosis. There are two major pathways of apoptosis: the death-receptor pathway, which is mediated by activation of death receptors, 
and the BCL2-regulated mitochondrial pathway, which is mediated by noxious stimuli that ultimately lead to mitochondrial injury. Ligation of death receptors recruits the 
adaptor protein FAS-associated death domain (FADD). FADD in turn recruits caspase 8, which ultimately activates caspase 3, the key “executioner” caspase. Cellular 
FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) can either inhibit or potentiate binding of FADD and caspase 8, depending on its concentration. In the intrinsic pathway, proapoptotic BH3 
proteins are activated by noxious stimuli, which interact with and inhibit antiapoptotic BCL2 or BCL-XL. Thus, BAX and BAK are free to induce mitochondrial permeabilization 
with release of cytochrome c, which ultimately results in the activation of caspase 9 through the apoptosome. Caspase 9 then activates caspase 3. SMAC/DIABLO is also 
released after mitochondrial permeabilization and acts to block the action of inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAPs), which inhibit caspase activation. There is potential 
cross-talk between the two pathways, which is mediated by the truncated form of BID (tBID) that is produced by caspase 8–mediated BID cleavage; tBID acts to inhibit 
the BCL2-BCL-XL pathway and to activate BAX and BAK. There is debate (indicated by the question mark) as to whether proapoptotic BH3 molecules (e.g., BIM and 
PUMA) act directly on BAX and BAK to induce mitochondrial permeability or whether they act only on BCL2-BCL-XL. APAF1, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1; BH3,

antigens	 mediated	 by	 T	 and	 B	 lymphocytes;	 (4)	 amplification	 of	 the	
inflammatory	 response	 with	 recruitment	 of	 specific	 and	 nonspecific	
effector	 cells	 by	 complement	 components,	 cytokines,	 kinins,	 arachi-
donic	acid	metabolites,	and	mast	cell–basophil	products;	and	(5) mac-
rophage,	 neutrophil,	 and	 lymphocyte	 participation	 in	 destruction	 of	
antigen	 with	 ultimate	 removal	 of	 antigen	 particles	 by	 phagocytosis	
(by	 macrophages	 or	 neutrophils)	 or	 by	 direct	 cytotoxic	 mechanisms	
(involving	 macrophages,	 neutrophils,	 DCs,	 and	 lymphocytes).	 Under	
normal	 circumstances,	 orderly	 progression	 of	 host	 defenses	 through	
these	 phases	 results	 in	 a	 well-controlled	 immune	 and	 inflammatory	
response	that	protects	the	host	from	the	offending	antigen.	However,	
dysfunction	of	any	of	the	host	defense	systems	can	damage	host	tissue	
and	 produce	 clinical	 disease.	 Furthermore,	 for	 certain	 pathogens	 or	
antigens,	the	normal	immune	response	itself	might	contribute	substan-
tially	to	the	tissue	damage.	For	example,	the	immune	and	inflammatory	
response	in	the	brain	to	certain	pathogens	such	as	M. tuberculosis	may	
be	 responsible	 for	 much	 of	 the	 morbidity	 rate	 of	 this	 disease	 in	 that	
organ	system	(Chap. 178).	In	addition,	the	morbidity	rate	associated	
with	certain	pneumonias	such	as	that	caused	by	Pneumocystis jiroveci	
may	 be	 associated	 more	 with	 inflammatory	 infiltrates	 than	 with	 the	
tissue-destructive	effects	of	the	microorganism	itself	(Chap. 220).

Molecular  Basis  of  Lymphocyte–Endothelial  Cell  Interac-
tions  The	 control	 of	 lymphocyte	 circulatory	 patterns	 between	 the	
bloodstream	 and	 peripheral	 lymphoid	 organs	 operates	 at	 the	 level	
of	 lymphocyte–endothelial	 cell	 interactions	 to	 control	 the	 specific-
ity	 of	 lymphocyte	 subset	 entry	 into	 organs.	 Similarly,	 lymphocyte–	
endothelial	 cell	 interactions	 regulate	 the	 entry	 of	 lymphocytes	 into	
inflamed	 tissue.	 Adhesion	 molecule	 expression	 on	 lymphocytes	 and	
endothelial	 cells	 regulates	 the	 retention	 and	 subsequent	 egress	 of	
lymphocytes	 within	 tissue	 sites	 of	 antigenic	 stimulation,	 delaying	
cell	 exit	 from	 tissue	 and	 preventing	 reentry	 into	 the	 circulating	
lymphocyte	 pool	 (Fig.  349-10).	 All	 types	 of	 lymphocyte	 migration	
begin	 with	 lymphocyte	 attachment	 to	 specialized	 regions	 of	 vessels,	
termed	 high  endothelial  venules	 (HEVs).	 An	 important	 concept	 is	
that	 adhesion	 molecules	 do	 not	 generally	 bind	 their	 ligand	 until	 a	
conformational	 change	 (ligand	 activation)	 occurs	 in	 the	 adhesion	
molecule	 that	 allows	 ligand	 binding.	 Induction	 of	 a	 conformation-	
dependent	determinant	on	an	adhesion	molecule	can	be	accomplished	
by	cytokines	or	via	ligation	of	other	adhesion	molecules	on	the	cell.

The	first	stage	of	lymphocyte–endothelial	cell	interactions,	attach-
ment and rolling,	occurs	when	lymphocytes	leave	the	stream	of	flowing	
blood	cells	in	a	postcapillary	venule	and	roll	along	venule	endothelial

FIGURE 349-10  Key migration steps of immune cells at sites of inflammation. Inflammation due to tissue damage or infection induces the release of cytokines (not shown) 
and inflammatory chemoattractants (red arrowheads) from distressed stromal cells and “professional” sentinels, such as mast cells and macrophages (not shown). The 
inflammatory signals induce upregulation of endothelial selectins and immunoglobulin “superfamily” members, particularly ICAM-1 and/or VCAM-1. Chemoattractants, 
particularly chemokines, are produced by or translocated across venular endothelial cells (red arrow) and are displayed in the lumen to rolling leukocytes. Those leukocytes 
that express the appropriate set of trafficking molecules undergo a multistep adhesion cascade (steps 1–3) and then polarize and move by diapedesis across the venular 
wall (steps 4 and 5). Diapedesis involves transient disassembly of endothelial junctions and penetration through the underlying basement membrane (step 6). Once in the 
extravascular (interstitial) space, the migrating cell uses different integrins to gain “footholds” on collagen fibers and other ECM molecules, such as laminin and fibronectin, 
and on inflammation-induced ICAM-1 on the surface of parenchymal cells (step 7). The migrating cell receives guidance cues from distinct sets of chemoattractants, 
particularly chemokines, which may be immobilized on glycosaminoglycans (GAG) that “decorate” many ECM molecules and stromal cells. Inflammatory signals also 
induce tissue dendritic cells (DCs) to undergo maturation. Once DCs process material from damaged tissues and invading pathogens, they upregulate CCR7, which allows 
them to enter draining lymph vessels that express the CCR7 ligand CCL21 (and CCL19). In lymph nodes (LNs), these antigen-loaded mature DCs activate naïve T cells and 
expand pools of effector lymphocytes, which enter the blood and migrate back to the site of inflammation. T cells in tissue also use this CCR7-dependent route to migrate 
from peripheral sites to draining lymph nodes through afferent lymphatics. (Reproduced with permission from AD Luster et al: Immune cell migration in inflammation: present 
and future therapeutic targets. Nat Immunol 6:1182, 2005.)

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disorderscells	 (Fig.	 349-10).	 Lymphocyte	 rolling	 is	 mediated	 by	 the	 l-selectin	
molecule	 (LECAM-1,	 LAM-1,	 CD62L)	 and	 slows	 cell	 transit	 time	
through	venules,	allowing	time	for	activation	of	adherent	cells.

The	 second	 stage	 of	 lymphocyte–endothelial	 cell	 interactions,	 firm 
adhesion with activation-dependent stable arrest,	requires	stimulation	of	
lymphocytes	by	chemoattractants	or	by	endothelial	cell–derived	cytok-
ines.	Cytokines	thought	to	participate	in	adherent	cell	activation	include	
members	 of	 the	 IL-8	 family,	 platelet-activation	 factor,	 leukotriene	 B4,	
and	 C5a.	 In	 addition,	 HEVs	 express	 chemokines,	 SLC	 (CCL21)	 and	
ELC	(CCL19),	which	participate	in	this	process.	Following	activation	by	
chemoattractants,	lymphocytes	shed	l-selectin	from	the	cell	surface	and	
upregulate	 cell	 CD11b/18	 (MAC-1)	 or	 CD11a/18	 (LFA-1)	 molecules,	
resulting	in	firm	attachment	of	lymphocytes	to	HEVs.

Lymphocyte	homing	to	peripheral	lymph	nodes	involves	adhesion	of	
l-selectin	to	glycoprotein	HEV	ligands	collectively	referred	to	as	periph-
eral node addressin	(PNAd),	whereas	homing	of	lymphocytes	to	intestine	
Peyer’s	 patches	 primarily	 involves	 adhesion	 of	 the	 α4β7	 integrin	 to	
mucosal	addressin	cell	adhesion	molecule-1	(MAdCAM-1)	on	the	Peyer’s	
patch	HEVs.	However,	for	migration	to	mucosal	Peyer’s	patch	lymphoid	
aggregates,	naïve	lymphocytes	primarily	use	l-selectin,	whereas	mem-
ory	 lymphocytes	 use	 α4β7	 integrin.	 α4β1	 integrin	 (CD49d/CD29,	
VLA-4)–VCAM-1	interactions	are	important	in	the	initial	interaction	
of	 memory	 lymphocytes	 with	 HEVs	 of	 multiple	 organs	 in	 sites	 of	
inflammation	(Table 349-11).

The	 third	 stage	 of	 leukocyte	 emigration	 in	 HEVs	 is	 sticking  and 
arrest.	Sticking	of	the	lymphocyte	to	endothelial	cells	and	arrest	at	the	
site	of	sticking	are	mediated	predominantly	by	ligation	of	a1β2	integrin	
LFA-1	to	the	integrin	ligand	ICAM-1	on	HEVs.	Whereas	the	first	three	
stages	 of	 lymphocyte	 attachment	 to	 HEVs	 take	 only	 a	 few	 seconds,	

the	fourth	stage	of	lymphocyte	emigration,	transendothelial migration,	
takes	 ~10	 min.	 Although	 the	 molecular	 mechanisms	 that	 control	
lymphocyte	transendothelial	migration	are	not	fully	characterized,	the	
HEV	 CD44	 molecule	 and	 molecules	 of	 the	 HEV	 glycocalyx	 (extra-
cellular	matrix)	are	thought	to	play	important	regulatory	roles	in	this	
process	 (Fig.	 349-10).	 Finally,	 expression	 of	 matrix	 metalloproteases	
capable	 of	 digesting	 the	 subendothelial	 basement	 membrane,	 rich	 in	
nonfibrillar	 collagen,	 appears	 to	 be	 required	 for	 the	 penetration	 of	
lymphoid	cells	into	the	extravascular	sites.

Abnormal	induction	of	HEV	formation	and	use	of	the	molecules	dis-
cussed	above	have	been	implicated	in	the	induction	and	maintenance	of	
inflammation	in	a	number	of	chronic	inflammatory	diseases.	In	animal	
models	of	type	1	diabetes	mellitus,	MAdCAM-1	and	GlyCAM-1	have	
been	 shown	 to	 be	 highly	 expressed	 on	 HEVs	 in	 inflamed	 pancreatic	
islets,	and	treatment	of	these	animals	with	inhibitors	of	l-selectin	and	
a4	integrin	function	blocked	the	development	of	type	1	diabetes	melli-
tus	(Chap. 403).	A	similar	role	for	abnormal	induction	of	the	adhesion	
molecules	of	lymphocyte	emigration	has	been	suggested	in	rheumatoid 
arthritis	 (Chap.  358),	 Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis	 (Chap.  382),	 Graves’ 
disease	 (Chap.  382),	 multiple  sclerosis	 (Chap.  444),	 Crohn’s  disease	 
(Chap. 326),	and	ulcerative colitis	(Chap. 326).

or	 glomerulonephritis	syndromes	 (Chaps. 314 and 363).	Deficiencies	
of	early	complement	components	are	associated	with	inefficient	clear-
ance	 of	 immune	 complexes	 and	 immune	 complex–mediated	 tissue	
damage	 in	 autoimmune	 syndromes,	 whereas	 deficiencies	 of	 the	 later	
complement	components	are	associated	with	susceptibility	to	recurrent	
Neisseria	infections	(Table 349-12).

Immediate-Type  Hypersensitivity  Helper	 T	 cells	 that	 drive	
antiallergen	 IgE	 responses	 are	 usually	 TH2-type	 inducer	 T	 cells	 that	
secrete	 IL-4,	 IL-5,	 IL-6,	 and	 IL-10.	 A	 subset	 of	 Tfh,	 Tfh13,	 cells	 have	
been	identified	that	produce	IL-4,	IL-5,	and	IL-13,	which	play	a	key	role	
in	responses	to	allergens	that	induce	IgE	and	mediate	anaphylaxis.	Mast	
cells	 and	 basophils	 have	 high-affinity	 receptors	 for	 the	 Fc	 portion	 of	
IgE	(FcRI),	and	cell-bound	antiallergen	IgE	effectively	“arms”	basophils	
and	 mast	 cells.	 Mediator	 release	 is	 triggered	 by	 antigen	 (allergen)	
interaction	 with	 Fc	 receptor-bound	 IgE,	 and	 the	 mediators	 released	
are	 responsible	 for	 the	 pathophysiologic	 changes	 of	 allergic  diseases.	
Mediators	released	from	mast	cells	and	basophils	can	be	divided	into	
three	broad	functional	types:	(1)	those	that	increase	vascular	perme-
ability	 and	 contract	 smooth	 muscle	 (histamine,	 platelet-activating	
factor,	 SRS-A,	 BK-A),	 (2)	 those	 that	 are	 chemotactic	 for	 or	 activate	
other	inflammatory	cells	(ECF-A,	NCF,	leukotriene	B4),	and	(3)	those	
that	modulate	the	release	of	other	mediators	(BK-A,	platelet-activating	
factor)	(Chap. 352).

Cytotoxic Reactions of Antibody 
In	 this	 type	 of	 immunologic	
injury,	 complement-fixing	 (C1-binding)	 antibodies	 against	 normal	 or	
foreign	cells	or	tissues	(IgM,	IgG1,	IgG2,	IgG3)	bind	complement	via	
the	 classic	 pathway	 and	 initiate	 a	 sequence	 of	 events	 similar	 to	 that	
initiated	by	immune-complex	deposition,	resulting	in	cell	lysis	or	tissue	
injury.	Examples	of	antibody-mediated	cytotoxic	reactions	include	red	
cell	 lysis	 in	 transfusion  reactions,	 Goodpasture’s  syndrome	 with	 anti–	
glomerular	 basement	 membrane	 antibody	 formation,	 and	 pemphigus 
vulgaris	with	anti-epidermal	antibodies	inducing	blistering	skin	disease.

Delayed-Type  Hypersensitivity  Reactions 
Inflammatory	
reactions	 initiated	 by	 mononuclear	 leukocytes	 and	 not	 by	 antibody	
alone	 have	 been	 termed	 delayed-type  hypersensitivity  reactions.	 The	
term	delayed	has	been	used	to	contrast	a	secondary	cellular	response	
that	appears	48–72	h	after	antigen	exposure	with	an	immediate	hyper-
sensitivity	 response	 generally	 seen	 within	 12	 h	 of	 antigen	 challenge	
and	 initiated	 by	 basophil	 mediator	 release	 or	 preformed	 antibody.	

For	 example,	 in	 an	 individual	 previously	 infected	 with	 M.  tuberculo-
sis	 organisms,	 intradermal	 placement	 of	 tuberculin	 purified	 protein	
derivative	as	a	skin	test	challenge	results	in	an	indurated	area	of	skin	at	
48–72	h,	indicating	previous	exposure	to	tuberculosis.

The	 cellular	 events	 that	 result	 in	 classic	 delayed-type	 hypersen-
sitivity	 responses	 are	 centered	 on	 T	 cells	 (predominantly,	 although	
not	 exclusively,	 IFN-γ,	 IL-2,	 and	 TNF-α-secreting	 TH1-type	 helper	
T	cells)	and	macrophages.	Recently,	NK	cells	have	been	suggested	to	
play	 a	 major	 role	 in	 the	 form	 of	 delayed	 hypersensitivity	 that	 occurs	
following	 skin	 contact	 with	 immunogens.	 First,	 local	 immune	 and	
inflammatory	responses	at	the	site	of	foreign	antigen	upregulate	endo-
thelial	cell	adhesion	molecule	expression,	promoting	the	accumulation	
of	lymphocytes	at	the	tissue	site.	In	the	scheme	outlined	in	Fig.	349-2,	
antigen	is	processed	by	DCs	and	presented	to	small	numbers	of	CD4+	
T	cells	expressing	a	TCR	specific	for	the	antigen.	IL-12	produced	by	
APCs	induces	T	cells	to	produce	IFN-γ	(TH1	response).	Macrophages	
frequently	 undergo	 epithelioid	 cell	 transformation	 and	 fuse	 to	 form	
multinucleated	giant	cells	in	response	to	IFN-γ.	This	type	of	mononu-
clear	cell	infiltrate	is	termed	granulomatous inflammation.	Examples	of	
diseases	in	which	delayed-type	hypersensitivity	plays	a	major	role	are	
fungal	infections	(histoplasmosis;	Chap. 212),	mycobacterial	infections	
(tuberculosis,	 leprosy;	 Chaps.  178  and  179),	 chlamydial	 infections	
(lymphogranuloma venereum;	Chap. 189),	helminth	infections	(schis-
tosomiasis;	Chap. 234),	reactions	to	toxins	(berylliosis;	Chap. 289),	and	
hypersensitivity	reactions	to	organic	dusts	(hypersensitivity pneumoni-
tis;	 Chap.  288).	 In	 addition,	 delayed-type	 hypersensitivity	 responses	
play	 important	 roles	 in	 tissue	 damage	 in	 autoimmune	 diseases	 such	
as	 rheumatoid  arthritis,	 temporal  arteritis,	 and	 granulomatosis	 with	
polyangiitis	(GPA)	(Chaps. 358 and 363).

Autophagy  Autophagy	is	a	process	that	involves	a	lysosomal	deg-
radation	pathway	mechanism	of	cells	to	dispose	of	intracellular	debris	
and	damaged	organelles.	Autophagy	by	cells	of	the	innate	immune	sys-
tem	is	used	to	control	intracellular	infectious	agents	such	as	M. tuber-
culosis,	in	part	by	initiation	of	phagosome	maturation	and	enhancing	
MHC	class	II	antigen	presentation	to	CD4	T	cells.

 ■ CLINICAL EVALUATION OF IMMUNE FUNCTION
Clinical	 assessment	 of	 immunity	 requires	 investigation	 of	 the	 four	
major	 components	 of	 the	 immune	 system	 that	 participate	 in	 host	
defense	and	in	the	pathogenesis	of	autoimmune	diseases:	(1)	humoral	
immunity	(B	cells);	(2)	cell-mediated	immunity	(T	cells,	monocytes);	
(3)	phagocytic	cells	of	the	reticuloendothelial	system	(macrophages),	as	
well	as	polymorphonuclear	leukocytes;	and	(4)	complement.	Clinical	
problems	that	require	an	evaluation	of	immunity	include	chronic	infec-
tions,	recurrent	infections,	unusual	infecting	agents,	and	certain	auto-
immune	syndromes.	The	type	of	clinical	syndrome	under	evaluation	
can	 provide	 information	 regarding	 possible	 immune	 defects	 (Chap. 
351).	Defects	in	cellular	immunity	generally	result	in	viral,	mycobacte-
rial,	and	fungal	infections.	An	extreme	example	of	deficiency	in	cellular	
immunity	is	AIDS	(Chap. 197).	Antibody	deficiencies	result	in	recur-
rent	bacterial	infections,	frequently	with	organisms	such	as	S. pneumo-
niae	and	Haemophilus influenzae	(Chap. 351).	Disorders	of	phagocyte	
function	are	frequently	manifested	by	recurrent	skin	infections,	often	
due	to	Staphylococcus aureus	(Chap. 64).	Finally,	deficiencies	of	early	
and	 late	 complement	 components	 are	 associated	 with	 autoimmune	
phenomena	and	recurrent	Neisseria	infections	(Table	349-12).	For fur-
ther discussion of useful initial screening tests of immune function, 
see Chap. 351.

 ■ IMMUNOTHERAPY
Many	therapies	for	autoimmune	and	inflammatory	diseases	involve	the	
use	of	nonspecific	immune-modulating	or	immunosuppressive	agents	
such	 as	 glucocorticoids	 or	 cytotoxic	 drugs.	 The	 goal	 of	 development	
of	new	treatments	for	immune-mediated	diseases	is	to	design	ways	to	
specifically	interrupt	pathologic	immune	responses,	leaving	nonpatho-
logic	 immune	 responses	 intact	 (Chap.  350).	 Novel	 ways	 to	 interrupt	
pathologic	immune	responses	that	are	under	investigation	include	the	
use	 of	 anti-inflammatory	 cytokines	 or	 specific	 cytokine	 inhibitors	 as

anti-inflammatory	agents,	the	use	of	monoclonal	antibodies	against	T	
or	B	lymphocytes	as	therapeutic	agents,	the	use	of	intravenous	Ig	for	
certain	infections	and	immune	complex–mediated	diseases,	the	use	of	
specific	cytokines	to	reconstitute	components	of	the	immune	system,	
and	bone	marrow	transplantation	to	replace	the	pathogenic	immune	
system	with	a	more	normal	immune	system	(Chaps. 64, 202, 350, and 
351).	CTLA-4	inhibitors	such	as	ipilimumab	and	tremelimumab	and	
anti-PD-1	antibodies	such	as	nivolumab	have	been	shown	to	reverse	
CD8	T-cell	exhaustion	in	melanoma	and	other	solid	tumors	and	induce	
immune	cell	control	of	tumor	growth	(Chap. 350).	A	new	technique	
that	 engineers	 autologous	 T	 cells	 to	 express	 antibody	 receptors	 that	
target	leukemic	cells,	termed	chimeric antigen receptor T cells	(CAR	T	
cells),	has	been	approved	by	the	U.S.	Food	and	Drug	Administration	
(FDA)	for	the	treatment	of	certain	types	of	leukemias	and	lymphomas	
(Chap. 350).

Cell-based	therapies	have	been	studied	for	many	years,	including	ex	
vivo	activation	of	NK	cells	for	reinfusion	into	patients	with	malignan-
cies,	and	DC	therapy	of	ex	vivo	priming	of	DCs	for	enhanced	presenta-
tion	of	cancer	antigens,	with	reinfusion	of	primed	DCs	into	the	patient.	
One	such	strategy	for	DC	therapy	has	been	approved	by	the	FDA	for	
treatment	of	advanced	prostate	cancer.

Cytokines and Cytokine Inhibitors  Several	TNF	inhibitors	are	
used	 as	 biological	 therapies	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	 rheumatoid	 arthri-
tis;	 these	 include	 monoclonal	 antibodies,	 TNF-R	 Fc	 fusion	 proteins,	
and	 Fab	 fragments.	 Use	 of	 anti-TNF-α	 antibody	 therapies	 such	 as	
adalimumab,	 infliximab,	 and	 golimumab	 has	 resulted	 in	 clinical	
improvement	in	patients	with	these	diseases	and	has	opened	the	way	
for	targeting	TNF-α	to	treat	other	severe	forms	of	autoimmune	and/or	
inflammatory	disease	(Chap. 350).	Blockage	of	TNF-α	has	been	effec-
tive	 in	 rheumatoid  arthritis,	 psoriasis,	 Crohn’s  disease,	 and	 ankylosing 
spondylitis.	Other	cytokine	inhibitors	are	recombinant	soluble	TNF-α	
receptor	 (R)	 fused	 to	 human	 Ig	 and	 anakinra	 (soluble	 IL-1  receptor 
antagonist,	or	IL-1ra).	The	treatment	of	autoinflammatory	syndromes	
(Table	349-5)	with	recombinant	IL-1	receptor	antagonist	can	prevent	
symptoms	in	these	syndromes,	because	the	overproduction	of	IL-1β	is	
a	hallmark	of	these	diseases.

TNF-αR-Fc	fusion	protein	(etanercept)	and	IL-1ra	act	to	inhibit	the	
activity	 of	 pathogenic	 cytokines	 in	 rheumatoid	 arthritis,	 i.e.,	 TNF-α	
and	 IL-1,	 respectively.	 Similarly,	 anti-IL-6,	 IFN-β,	 and	 IL-11	 act	
to	 inhibit	 pathogenic	 proinflammatory	 cytokines.	 Anti-IL-6	 (tocili-
zumab)	inhibits	IL-6	activity,	whereas	IFN-β	and	IL-11	decrease	IL-1	
and	TNF-α	production	(Chap. 350).	Of	particular	note	has	been	the	
successful	use	of	IFN-γ	in	the	treatment	of	the	phagocytic	cell	defect	in	
chronic granulomatous disease	(Chap. 64).

TH17	CD4	T	cells	have	been	implicated	in	the	pathogenesis	of	pso-
riasis,	ulcerative	colitis,	and	other	autoimmune	diseases.	Monoclonal	
antibodies	 have	 now	 been	 developed	 that	 target	 cytokines	 (IL-12,	
IL-23)	that	induce	TH17	T-cell	differentiation	and	are	licensed	by	the	
FDA	 for	 treatment	 of	 psoriasis.	 Monoclonal	 antibodies	 that	 directly	
target	 IL-17	 have	 also	 recently	 been	 licensed	 for	 psoriasis	 and	 psori-
atic	arthritis	treatment.	Monoclonal	antibodies	against	cytokines	and	
immunoregulatory	molecules	are	now	mainstays	of	cancer	and	auto-
immune	disease	therapy	(Chap. 350).

Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) 
IVIg	has	been	used	suc-
cessfully	 to	 block	 reticuloendothelial	 cell	 function	 and	 immune	
complex	 clearance	 in	 various	 immune	 cytopenias	 such	 as	 immune	
thrombocytopenia	 (Chap.  115).	 In	 addition,	 IVIg	 is	 useful	 for	 pre-
vention	 of	 tissue	 damage	 in	 certain	 inflammatory	 syndromes	 such	
as	 Kawasaki	 disease	 (Chap.  363)	 and	 as	 Ig	 replacement	 therapy	 for	
certain	types	of	immunoglobulin	deficiencies	(Chap. 351).	In	addition,	
controlled	 clinical	 trials	 support	 the	 use	 of	 IVIg	 in	 selected	 patients	
with	 graft-versus-host	 disease,	 multiple	 sclerosis,	 myasthenia	 gravis,	
Guillain-Barré	syndrome,	and	chronic	demyelinating	polyneuropathy.

Stem  Cell  Transplantation  Hematopoietic	 stem	 cell	 transplan-
tation	 (SCT)	 is	 now	 being	 comprehensively	 studied	 to	 treat	 several	
autoimmune	diseases	including	systemic	lupus	erythematosus,	multi-
ple	sclerosis,	and	scleroderma.	The	goal	of	immune	reconstitution	in	

autoimmune	disease	syndromes	is	to	replace	a	dysfunctional	immune	
system	 with	 a	 normally	 reactive	 immune	 cell	 repertoire.	 Preliminary	
results	 in	 patients	 with	 scleroderma	 and	 lupus	 have	 showed	 encour-
aging	results.	Controlled	clinical	trials	in	these	three	diseases	are	now	
being	launched	in	the	United	States	and	Europe	to	compare	the	toxicity	
and	efficacy	of	conventional	immunosuppression	therapy	with	that	of	
myeloablative	autologous	SCT.	Recently,	SCT	was	used	in	the	setting	of	
HIV-1	infection.	HIV-1	infection	of	CD4+	T	cells	requires	the	presence	
of	 surface	 CD4	 receptor	 and	 the	 chemokine	 receptor	 5	 (CCR5)	 co-	
receptor.	Studies	have	demonstrated	that	patients	who	are	homozygous	
for	 a	 32-bp	 deletion	 in	 the	 CCR5	 allele	 do	 not	 express	 CD4+	 T-cell	
CCR5	 and	 thus	 are	 resistant	 to	 HIV-1	 infection	 with	 HIV-1	 strains	
that	use	this	co-receptor.	Stem	cells	from	a	homozygous	CCR5	delta32	
donor	were	transplanted	to	an	HIV-1-infected	patient	following	stan-
dard	conditioning	for	such	transplants,	and	the	patient	has	maintained	
long-term	control	of	the	virus	without	antiretrovirals.	Thus,	a	number	
of	recent	insights	into	immune	system	function	have	spawned	a	new	
field	of	interventional	immunotherapy	and	have	enhanced	the	prospect	
for	development	of	more	specific	and	nontoxic	therapies	for	immune	
and	inflammatory	diseases	(Chap. 350).

INTRODUCTION
Immune homeostasis	is	the	maintenance	of	a	balance	between	immu-
nity	that	protects	the	host	and	dysregulated	immunity	that	predisposes	
the	host	to	harmful	infections,	autoimmunity,	or	malignancies.	Over-
activity	of	innate	and	adaptive	immunity	leads	to	autoimmunity	and/
or	inflammatory	diseases.	Underactivity	of	immune	responses	can	lead	
to	both	immune	deficiency	and	autoimmunity.	Disruption	of	immune	
homeostasis	contributes	either	directly	or	indirectly	to	many	forms	of	
disease.	 Thus,	 a	 major	 goal	 of	 immunotherapy	 is	 to	 either	 maintain	
immune	 homeostasis	 or	 reestablish	 immune	 balance	 in	 diseases	 of	
immune	dysregulation.

This	is	an	important	time	in	the	study	of	the	biology	of	the	immune	
system.	The	development	of	high-throughput	genome	sequencing,	full	
genome	 transcriptome	 analysis,	 proteomics,	 metabolomics,	 and	 the	
realization	 of	 the	 importance	 of	 the	 human	 microbiome	 to	 immune	
system	homeostasis	have	provided	remarkable	opportunities	for	devel-
opment	 of	 new	 treatments	 for	 immune-mediated	 and	 malignant	
diseases.	The	emerging	concept	is	that	the	immune	system	itself	can	
be	 manipulated	 to	 be	 used	 as	 a	 therapeutic	 intervention	 for	 cancer	
and	 also	 can	 be	 safely	 manipulated	 for	 control	 of	 autoimmune	 dis-
ease.	Moreover,	new	data	are	emerging	that	immune	dysregulation	is	
involved	in	the	pathogenesis	of	diseases	not	traditionally	thought	of	as	
immune-related,	 such	 as	 neurodegenerative	 diseases	 and	 atheroscle-
rotic	 cardiovascular	 disease,	 and	 that	 the	 normal	 process	 of	 aging	 is	
associated	with	inflammatory	processes.

Thus,	a	new	frontier	of	medicine	is	to	understand	basic	regulatory	
mechanisms	of	the	innate	and	adaptive	immune	system	with	the	goal	
of	 learning	 specific	 rules	 of	 immune	 system	 regulation,	 such	 that	

eventually	 the	 immune	 system	 can	 be	 “tuned”	 to	 safely	 stay	 in	 the	
zone	 of	 immune	 homeostasis	 and,	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 effectively	 pro-
tect	against	emerging	and	reemerging	infectious	diseases	or	eliminate	
malignancies	as	they	arise.	Moreover,	when	inflammatory	or	autoim-
mune	diseases	arise,	effective	strategies	of	immune	regulation	can	be	
developed	to	safely	treat	them.

Thus,	 this	 chapter	 builds	 on	 Chap.  349,  Introduction  to  the 
Immune  System,	 to	 discuss	 T-	 and	 B-cell	 immunoregulation,	 to	
highlight	 recent	 successes	 in	 translating	 basic	 immunologic	 research	
into	 treatments	 of	 various	 hematopoietic	 and	 solid	 tumors,	 and	 to	
discuss	 mechanisms	 of	 immune	 dysregulation	 in	 autoimmunity	 and		
aging.

MECHANISMS OF REGULATION OF T-CELL 
ACTIVATION
Key	roles	of	T	cells	are	to	respond	to	and	eliminate	cells	bearing	foreign	
antigens	and	to	ignore	cells	expressing	self-antigens.	To	respond	to	for-
eign	antigens,	stimulating	cells	must	deliver	an	activating	co-stimulating	
signal	in	addition	to	TCR	ligation.	To	avoid	responding	to	cells	bearing	
self-antigens,	 T	 cells	 must	 also	 maintain	 immune	 tolerance.	 Central	
T-cell	 tolerance	 is	 maintained	 by	 autoreactive	 T-cell	 deletion	 in	 the	
thymus,	 while	 peripheral	 tolerance	 is	 maintained	 by	 regulatory	 T	
cells	(Treg),	T-cell	anergy,	and	peripheral	clonal	deletion	(see	section	
below,	 Mechanisms	 of	 Immune	 Dysregulation	 in	 Autoimmune	 Dis-
ease).	Thus,	T-cell	activation	is	an	integral	component	of	the	adaptive	
immune	response	to	pathogens	as	well	as	to	tumor	neoantigens.

Two	stimulatory	signals	are	required	for	T-cell	activation.	One	T-cell	
signal	is	delivered	by	antigen	peptide	presented	in	the	context	of	MHC	
(Chap. 349).	However,	in	the	absence	of	a	co-stimulating	signal,	the	T	
cell	will	not	be	activated	by	peptide	MHC	alone	but	rather	will	become	
anergic	 or	 unresponsive.	 A	 second	 co-stimulatory	 signal	 is	 needed	
for	T-cell	activation,	resulting	in	cytoskeletal	remodeling,	production	
of	 cytokines,	 and	 cell	 survival	 and	 differentiation.	 In	 addition	 to	 the	
TCR/CD3	 complex	 (Chap.  349),	 T	 cells	 express	 a	 complex	 array	 of	
co-stimulatory	as	well	as	inhibitory	molecules	that	bind	to	their	respec-
tive	 receptors	 on	 the	 surface	 of	 antigen-presenting	 cells	 (APCs)	 and	
orchestrate	both	initiation	and	control	of	T-cell	activation	to	maintain	
immune	 homeostasis	 (Fig.  350-1,  and  see  Chap.  349,  Table  349-1).	
Of	 these,	 CD28,	 cytotoxic	 T	 lymphocyte	 antigen	 4	 (CTLA-4),	 and	
programmed	cell	death	protein	1	(PD-1)	and	their	ligands	were	among	
the	first	to	be	recognized	to	be	central	to	control	of	T-cell	activation.

The	CD28	molecule	is	a	member	of	the	immunoglobulin	(Ig)	super-
family	and	is	the	original	member	of	a	subfamily	of	co-stimulatory	or	
inhibitory	 molecules	 on	 the	 surface	 of	 T	 cells	 that	 includes	 CTLA-4,	
inducible	 T-cell	 costimulator	 (ICOS),	 PD-1,	 T-cell	 immunoreceptor	
with	 Ig	 and	 ITIM	 domains	 (TIGIT),	 and	 B-	 and	 T-cell	 attenuator	
(BTLA)	(Fig.	350-1).	CD28	stimulates	intracellular	signaling	through	
AKT	 and	 PI3	 kinase,	 resulting	 in	 induction	 of	 NF-κB,	 AP-1,	 and	
NFAT,	 which	 are	 all	 critical	 for	 T-cell	 activation	 and	 differentiation		
(Chap. 349, Fig. 349-7).	CTLA-4	and	PD-1	are	CD28	subfamily	mem-
bers	that	control	T-cell	activation	by	inhibiting	the	stimulating	activity	
of	CD28	and	other	T-cell	co-stimulatory	molecules.

CTLA-4	is	a	key	negative	regulator	of	T-cell	activation	that	down-
modulates	the	T-cell	response	to	antigen	by	interaction	with	its	ligands,	
B7-1	 and	 B7-2,	 to	 control	 unchecked	 T-cell	 proliferation.	 CTLA-4	
is	 upregulated	 following	 TCR	 engagement	 with	 MHC/peptide,	 thus	
dampening	 TCR	 signaling	 by	 competing	 with	 CD28	 binding	 to	 B7	
ligands	(B7-1	[CD80]	and	B7-2	[CD86])	on	APCs	by	virtue	of	higher	
affinity	of	CTLA-4	for	B7	ligands.	In	this	manner,	T	cells	respond	to	
foreign	antigen	but	are	prevented	from	damaging	host	tissues	due	to	
overexuberant	 responses	 (Fig.  350-2A).	 CTLA-4	 thus	 mediates	 its	
dampening	effect	on	T-cell	activation	by	competing	with	T-cell	CD28	
binding	 to	 B7	 receptors,	 as	 well	 as	 through	 the	 suppressive	 effect	 of	
CTLA-4+	Tregs.	The	human	CTLA4	gene	is	just	one	of	several	genes	
in	 which	 monogenetic	 mutations	 are	 associated	 with	 decreased	 Treg	
function	and	autoimmune	syndromes	(Table 350-1).

PD-1	 is	 also	 a	 major	 inhibitory	 molecule	 of	 T-cell	 activation	 by	
interaction	with	its	ligands	PD-L1	and	PD-L2	on	APCs	(Fig.	350-1).

CHECKPOINT INHIBITION 
THERAPY FOR CANCER
The	field	of	immune	checkpoint	therapy	has	joined	sur-
gery,	radiation,	chemotherapy,	and	targeted	therapy	as	a	
mainstay	for	cancer	therapy.	There	are	now	an	extensive	
number	 of	 therapeutic	 monoclonal	 antibodies	 approved	
by	the	U.S.	Food	and	Drug	Administration	(FDA),	initially	
starting	with	melanoma	in	2011–2014	and	now	available	
for	a	wide	range	of	malignancies	including	kidney,	lung,	
liver,	 head	 and	 neck,	 and	 gastric	 tumors	 (Table  350-2).	
Both	CTLA-4	and	PD-1	blockade	have	proved	remarkably	
successful	 in	 treating	 a	 number	 of	 tumors,	 but	 only	 in	
a	 fraction	 of	 patients.	 Because	 each	 receptor	 ligand	 pair	
regulates	distinct	T-cell	inhibitory	pathways,	combination	
therapy	using	anti-PD-1	and	anti-CTLA-4	antibodies	has	
been	especially	useful	and	has	induced	significant	tumor	
regression	in	~50%	of	melanoma	patients.	What	is	differ-
ent	in	the	use	of	checkpoint	inhibitor	antibodies	is	that	the	
therapy	is	not	targeted	to	the	tumor	per	se,	but	rather	is	
targeted	to	immunoregulatory	molecules	on	host	T	cells.	
Moreover,	 therapy	 is	 not	 targeted	 to	 specific	 molecules	
on	 tumors,	 but	 rather	 is	 targeted	 to	 release	 exhausted	
tumor-infiltrating	 T	 cells	 (TILs)	 to	 be	 activated	 to	 kill	
tumor	cells	by	removing	immune	regulatory	inhibition.

FIGURE 350-1  Regulatory stimulating or inhibiting molecules on T cells or antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs), tumor cells, or other cells.

While	 initially	 thought	 to	 be	 a	 cell	 death	 receptor,	 PD-1	 is	 rapidly	
expressed	upon	activation	of	T	and	B	cells	and	is	also	a	marker	of	T	
follicular	 helper	 CD4+	 T	 cells	 in	 B-cell	 germinal	 centers.	 PD-1	 acts	
to	 dampen	 T-cell	 activation	 by	 dephosphorylation	 of	 CD28	 via	 the	
Src	 homology	 region	 2-containing	 protein	 tyrosine	 phosphatase	 2		
(SHP2).

Although	a	marker	of	immune	cell	activation,	PD-1	is	also	a	marker	
for	exhausted	T	cells.	T-cell	exhaustion	is	an	important	mechanism	of	
maintaining	 immune	 homeostasis	 and	 preventing	 host	 tissue	 T-cell	
damage,	but	also	leads	to	immune	dysfunction	in	the	setting	of	chronic	
antigenic	stimulation	such	as	occurs	in	chronic	viral	diseases	(HIV-1,	
hepatitis	C)	and	in	cancer.	Chronic	viral	diseases	and	tumors	lead	to	
transcriptional	 and	 metabolic	 signatures	 that	 define	 the	 exhausted	
T-cell	state.	T-cell	exhaustion	has	been	a	major	roadblock	to	overcome	
for	successful	cancer	immunotherapy.

CTLA-4	 induces	 tumor	 rejection	 by	 a	 number	 of	
mechanisms.	 First,	 anti-CTLA-4	 antibody	 mediates	
direct	blockade	of	CTLA-4	competition	with	CD28	for	
B7-1	 and	 B7-2	 co-stimulatory	 ligands,	 thus	 allowing	
CD28-mediated	T-cell	activation	(Fig. 350-2B).	Tumor	
cells	do	not	express	B7	molecules;	thus,	CTLA-4	blockade	likely	occurs	
in	tumor-draining	lymph	nodes	where	exhausted	T	cells	interact	with	
APCs	presenting	tumor	neoantigens	to	T	cells.	A	second	mechanism	of	
CTLA-4	blockade–induced	tumor	rejection	is	depletion	or	reduction	
in	suppressive	effects	of	Tregs.	Suppressive	effect	of	Tregs	include	secre-
tion	 of	 immunosuppressive	 cytokines	 such	 as	 transforming	 growth	
factor	(TGF)-β	or	interleukin	(IL)	10	or	by	direct	inhibition	of	T-cell	
proliferation	and/or	cytolytic	activity.	A	third	potential	mechanism	of	
anti-CTLA-4	blockade	is	remodeling	and	broadening	of	the	peripheral	
TCR	repertoire	for	tumor	antigens.	Evidence	suggests	that	the	effects	
of	anti-CTLA-4	antibody	are	restricted	primarily	to	tumor	neoantigen-	
specific	CD8	T	cells	within	the	tumor	microenvironment	and	not	to		
T	cells	in	lymph	nodes	or	spleen.

PD-1	 blockade	 by	 PD-1	 antibody	 also	 induces	 tumor	 regression	
by	 reversing	 T-cell	 exhaustion,	 leading	 to	 enhanced	 T-cell	 killing

of  tumor  cells.  Optimal  PD-1  antibody-mediated  checkpoint  inhi-
bition  is  seen  when  infiltrating  CD8  T  cells  are  present  in  the  tumor 
microenvironment  and  reversal  of  the  exhausted  T-cell  state  can 
occur  in  situ.  PD-1  blockade  can  also  act  by  reversal  of  metabolic 
reprogramming  of  exhausted  T  cells,  leading  to  enhanced  cytolytic 
T-cell  effector  function.  Antibodies  to  the  primary  PD-1  receptor, 
PD-L1,  are  also  sufficient  to  induce  reversal  of  T-cell  exhaustion  and 
induce  tumor  killing  and  are  approved  by  the  FDA  for  treatment  of 
non-small-cell lung cancer (Table 350-2). PD-L1 is induced on tumor 
cells by TH1 cytokines, which may explain anti-PD-L1 efficacy since TH1  
cytokines  drive  cytotoxic  T-cell  responses  (Chap.  349).  Efficacy  of 
anti-PD-L1 may also be due in part to mediation of antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) killing of tumor cells (Chap. 349).

Tumor cells express neoantigens that are targets for T-cell recognition 
in  the  tumor  microenvironment.  Immune  pressure  within  the  tumor 
microenvironment can select for tumor cells that present few or mutated 
neoantigens  and  thus  escape  ongoing  antitumor  immunity.  Moreover, 
a low number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor microenviron-
ment  production  of  immunosuppressive  indoleamine  2,3-dioxygenase 
(IDO),  and  tumor  infiltration  with  either  myeloid-derived  suppressor 
cells or Tregs can also limit checkpoint blockade therapy.

Other strategies for improving the immunoregulation of antitumor 
responses  include  combinations  of  anti-PD-1,  anti-CTLA-4,  or  anti- 
PD-L1  antibodies  with  other  checkpoint  inhibitors  (see  Chap.  349, 
Table  349-1,  and  Fig.  350-1).  For  example,  engagement  of  the  ICOS 
pathway  enhances  the  efficacy  of  CTLA-4  blockade  in  animal  models 
of  cancer  immunotherapy.  T-cell  immunoglobulin  and  mucin-domain 
containing-3 (TIM-3), TIGIT, or lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) 
inhibition  has  been  suggested  to  enhance  checkpoint  inhibition  and 
augment CD8 tumor cell killing. A new transcription factor, thymocyte- 
selection-associated  high  mobility  box  (TOX),  has  been  defined  as  a 
key controller of CD8 T-cell exhaustion. Thus, TOX inhibition could 
synergize  with  checkpoint  inhibition  therapy  to  reverse  the  T-cell 
exhaustion  state.  Finally,  the  combination  of  checkpoint  inhibition 
with other cancer treatments including chemotherapy, radiation, tumor 
signaling pathway inhibitors, and epigenetic modulators is being tested.

Anti-PD-L1  antibodies  also  mediate  antitumor  effects  by  ADCC, 
which  utilizes  natural  killer  (NK)  effector  cells  (Chap.  349).  Indeed, 
a  number  of  checkpoint  inhibitor  molecules  have  been  found  to  be 
expressed  on  NK  cells  including  CTLA-4,  PD-1,  LAG-3,  TIGIT,  and 
TIM-3 (Fig. 350-1; see also Chap. 349, Table 349-1). A new field of 
work is to target NK cells with existing checkpoint inhibitors and with 
antibodies  against  an  NK-specific  inhibitory  molecule,  NKG2A,  that 
are designed release NK cells to kill tumor cells. One such anti-NKG2A 
antibody,  monalizumab,  has  entered  human  clinical  trials.  NK  cells 
also express natural cytotoxicity-activating receptors including NKp30, 
NKp44,  and  NKp46  receptors  (Chap.  349).  Engagement  of  natural 
cytotoxicity-activating  receptors  in  concert  with  the  NK  FcγRIII 
(CD16) and antibody against a tumor antigen also can enhance NK cell 
targeting of tumor antigens and is in preclinical development.

CHIMERIC ANTIGEN RECEPTOR T CELLS
Chimeric  antigen  receptor  (CAR)  T  cells  are  synthetic  hybrid  recep-
tors  created  by  recombinant  techniques  that  combine  an  extracellu-
lar  domain,  usually  derived  from  an  antibody  single-chain  variable 
fragment (scFv), with intracellular signaling domains from activating 
co-stimulatory molecules (from endogenous TCRs, CD28, or 4-1BB) 
that  allow  for  retargeting  of  T  cells  to  antigens  on  malignant  cells 
(Fig. 350-3). A CAR T cell targeting the CD19 molecule on malignant 
B  cells  provided  the  first  and  most  promising  therapeutic  results  in 
the treatment of B-cell malignancies, with complete response rates of 
70–90%. CAR T cells targeting the NY-ESO antigen on sarcoma cells 
have induced remissions in patients with synovial cell sarcoma. CAR 
T cells targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on myeloma cells 
have also induced clinical responses. The CAR T-cell strategy is being 
developed for targeting solid tumors and modified as universal CAR T 
cells to overcome the need for MHC matching with T CAR recipients. 
One  such  strategy  is  to  modify  T  cells  to  release  cytokine,  express 
co-stimulatory  ligands,  or  secrete  checkpoint-blocking  single-chain 
variable  fragment  (scFvs).  The  next  generation  of  CAR  T  cells  are 
known  as  T  cells  redirected  for  universal  cytokine-mediated  killing 
(TRUCKs).  Cytokine-secreting  tumor-specific  T  cells  could  harness

autoreactive	T	cells	or	modification	of	their	TCRs	occurs	in	the	thy-
mus,	and	for	B	cells	with	self-reactive	B-cell	receptors,	central	deletion	
occurs	in	bone	marrow.	Peripheral	tolerance	occurs	in	lymph	nodes,	
spleen,	and	tissue-associated	lymphoid	tissue	such	as	gastrointestinal	
tract	Peyer’s	patches.	The	sites	and	modes	of	peripheral	tolerance	are	
varied	and	reflect	the	complex	cellular	and	cytokine	interactions	that	
occur	in	mediation	of	T-	and	B-cell	adaptive	immunity	(Chap. 349).	
While	 B-	 and	 T-cell	 deletion	 can	 occur	 in	 the	 periphery,	 tolerance	
can	also	occur	with	cell	inactivation	termed	anergy,	a	state	of	immune	
responsiveness	following	contact	with	antigen.	T-	and	B-cell	responses	
are	 also	 dampened	 in	 the	 periphery	 by	 Tregs	 producing	 TGF-β	 and	
IL-10.	The	result	of	immune	dysregulation	in	autoimmune	disease	is	
the	production	of	a	myriad	of	antibodies	against	self-antigens	(autoan-
tibodies),	many	of	which	are	pathogenic	for	the	clinical	manifestations

Tregs  are  CD4  and  CD8  T  cells  that  downmodulate  B-  and  T-cell 
responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues to prevent autoimmune dis-
eases, and the transcriptional regulator FOXP3 is centrally involved in 
the establishment of the Treg phenotype. Mutations in genes that lead 
to loss of Tregs or their function result in autoimmune and inflamma-
tory syndromes (Table 350-1). Mutations in FOXP3 lead to an X-linked 
syndrome  characterized  by  immune  dysregulation,  polyendocrinop-
athy, and enteropathy (IPEX). Similarly, mutations in the CD25 (IL-2 
receptor α) molecule expressed on Tregs lead to enteropathy, dermatitis, 
other manifestations of autoimmunity, and susceptibility to infections. 
Mutations  in  the  checkpoint  inhibitor  T-cell  molecule  CTLA-4—also 
expressed on Tregs—leads to loss of Treg function and results in mul-
tiple  autoimmune  syndromes  in  humans  depending  on  the  CTLA-4 
mutation. In mice, knockout of the ctla4 gene leads to massive uncon-
trolled  lymphoproliferation  and  early  death.  Finally,  mutations  in 
the  lipopolysaccharide  (lipopolysaccharide-responsive  and  beige-like 
anchor [LRBA]) protein cause a syndrome in infants characterized by 
enteritis, hypogammaglobulinemia, and autoimmune cytopenias.

Chronic  viral  infections  can  perturb  Treg  number  and  function. 
In  HIV-1  infection,  chronic  antigenic  stimulation  leads  to  shifts  in 
the  B-cell  repertoire  toward  an  autoimmune  permissive  state,  with 
increased numbers of autoreactive B cells and decreased CD4+ Tregs 
leading to serum autoantibodies or clinical manifestations of autoim-
mune disease in ~50% of untreated HIV-1-infected individuals.

In  addition  to  checkpoint  inhibition  for  cancer  immunotherapy, 
monoclonal antibodies can be used for immune modulation to correct 
dysregulated immunity in autoimmune diseases to restore normal lev-
els of immunoregulatory tolerance control. Monoclonal therapies have 
been developed and successfully used for the treatment of autoimmune 
and  inflammatory  diseases  (Table  350-4).  Some  of  the  monoclonal 
antibodies such as anti-CD20 (rituximab) have also been used for the 
treatment  of  B-cell  malignancies.  CTLA-4-Fc  has  been  developed  to 
prevent  CD28-induced  T-cell  activation,  resulting  in  immune  sup-
pression for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and transplantation. TNF-α has 
been shown to play a central role in RA pathogenesis, and anti-TNF-α 
antibodies have been successful in treatment of RA and are approved 
for  other  autoimmune  syndromes  including  other  forms  of  arthritis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. Antibodies against α4 inte-
grin block the migration of α4β7+ T cells to the gastrointestinal tract 
and  are  used  to  treat  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD).  The  TH17 
cytokine  IL-17  has  been  found  to  be  overproduced  in  psoriasis,  and 
monoclonal anti-IL-17 antibody therapy for psoriasis is now approved 
by the FDA (Chap. 57).

Tregs  are  therapeutic  candidates  for  restoring  immune  tolerance  in 
autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, with the prospect of reduc-
ing or replacing immunosuppressive drugs. Like CAR T cells, Treg ther-
apy involves expanding autologous Treg cells in vitro and reinfusing them 
into  individuals  with  autoimmune  or  inflammatory  diseases.  To  make 
Treg therapy more targeted for suppression of antigen-specific immune 
responses, CAR T technology is being used to redirect Tregs to patho-
genic T and B cells. Treg cellular therapy is in human clinical trials for 
the treatment of graft-versus-host disease in the setting of transplantation 
and for prevention of progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus (Chap. 404).

IMMUNE DYSREGULATION IN AGING
Aging  of  the  immune  system  in  humans  is  characterized  by  decline  in 
both innate and adaptive immunity. Aging is also paradoxically associated 
with  a  state  of  chronic  inflammation,  termed  “inflammaging,”  with  an 
increased risk of autoimmune disease. Aging is associated with reduced 
NK cell function, reduced monocyte/macrophage immune cell expression 
of toll-like receptors, reduced chemotaxis and phagocytosis, and reduced 
MHC expression and signaling. Other phagocytic cells such as polymor-
phonuclear cells are similarly dysfunctional. Dendritic cells in aged indi-
viduals are present in reduced numbers with impaired antigen-presenting 
function  and  signaling.  Adaptive  immunity  is  similarly  impaired  with 
decreased antibody repertoire breadth, decrease in number of B cells, and 
decrease in B-cell responses to specific antigens. Similarly, T-cell responses 
to antigen are decreased, such as to seasonal influenza vaccination.

Aging is characterized by accumulation of senescent cells in many 
tissues  that  secrete  inflammatory  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  other 
inflammatory  mediators.  The  best  example  of  the  role  of  enhanced 
cytokine  production  in  the  “inflammaging”  syndrome  is  in  thymic 
atrophy, which is a major event contributing to age-associated immune 
system  decline.  During  life,  the  thymus  decreases  in  size  and  naïve 
T-cell output decreases; beginning with puberty, thymocytes progres-
sively  decrease  in  number,  such  that  after  ~50  years  of  age,  ~90%  of 
thymocytes have been replaced by adipocytes in the thymus perivas-
cular  space.  Thymic  adipocytes  produce  leukemia  inhibitory  factor, 
oncostatin  M,  IL-6,  and  stem  cell  factor  (SCF).  Administration  of 
these  cytokines  to  young  mice  induces  thymic  atrophy,  demonstrat-
ing that these thymosuppressive cytokines actively induce thymocyte 
loss.  Adipocytes  in  other  sites  also  produce  inflammatory  cytokines, 
contributing  to  tissue  senescence.  Finally,  respiratory  failure  due  to 
SARS-CoV-1, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or SARS-CoV-2 
infection  is  associated  with  a  cytokine  release  syndrome  with  IL-6 
overproduction, which occurs most frequently in older individuals.

351 Primary Immune  
Deficiency Diseases
Alain Fischer

Immunity	is	intrinsic	to	life	and	an	important	tool	in	the	fight	for	survival	
against	pathogenic	microorganisms.	The	human	immune	system	can	be	
divided	into	two	major	components:	the	innate	immune	system	and	the	
adaptive	immune	system	(Chap. 349).	The	innate	immune	system	pro-
vides	the	rapid	triggering	of	inflammatory	responses	based	on	the	rec-
ognition	(at	the	cell	surface	or	within	cells)	of	either	molecules	expressed	
by	microorganisms	or	molecules	that	serve	as	“danger	signals”	released	
by	cells	under	attack.	These	receptor/ligand	interactions	trigger	signaling	
events	 that	 ultimately	 lead	 to	 inflammation.	 Virtually	 all	 cell	 lineages	
(not	just	immune	cells)	are	involved	in	innate	immune	responses;	how-
ever,	myeloid	cells	(i.e.,	neutrophils	and	macrophages)	play	a	major	role	
because	of	their	phagocytic	capacity.	The	adaptive	immune	system	oper-
ates	by	clonal	recognition	of	antigens	followed	by	a	dramatic	expansion	
of	antigen-reactive	cells	and	execution	of	an	immune	effector	program.	
Most	of	the	effector	cells	die	off	rapidly,	whereas	memory	cells	persist.	
Although	both	T	and	B	lymphocytes	recognize	distinct	chemical	moi-
eties	and	execute	distinct	adaptive	immune	responses,	the	latter	is	largely	
dependent	 on	 the	 former	 in	 generating	 long-lived	 humoral	 immunity.	
Adaptive	 responses	 utilize	 components	 of	 the	 innate	 immune	 system;	
for	example,	the	antigen-presentation	capabilities	of	dendritic	cells	help	
to	 determine	 the	 type	 of	 effector	 response.	 Not	 surprisingly,	 immune	
responses	are	controlled	by	a	series	of	regulatory	mechanisms.

Hundreds	 of	 gene	 products	 have	 been	 characterized	 as	 effectors	 or	
mediators	of	the	immune	system	(Chap. 349).	Whenever	the	expression	
or	function	of	one	of	these	products	is	genetically	impaired	(provided	the	
function	is	nonredundant),	a	primary	immunodeficiency	(PID)	occurs.
PIDs	 are	 genetic	 diseases	 with	 primarily	 Mendelian	 inheritance.	
More	 than	 450	 conditions	 have	 now	 been	 described,	 and	 deleterious	
mutations	in	~420	genes	have	been	identified.	The	overall	prevalence	
of	PIDs	has	been	estimated	in	various	countries	at	5–10	per	100,000	
individuals;	however,	given	the	difficulty	in	diagnosing	these	rare	and	
complex	 diseases,	 this	 figure	 is	 probably	 an	 underestimate.	 PIDs	 can	
involve	all	possible	aspects	of	immune	responses,	from	innate	through	
adaptive,	cell	differentiation,	and	effector	function	and	regulation.	For	
the	sake	of	clarity,	PIDs	should	be	classified	according	to	(1)	the	arm	
of	the	immune	system	that	is	defective	and	(2)	the	mechanism	of	the	
defect	(when	known).	Table 351-1	classifies	the	most	prevalent	PIDs	
according	 to	 this	 manner	 of	 classification;	 however,	 one	 should	 bear	
in	 mind	 that	 the	 classification	 of	 PIDs	 sometimes	 involves	 arbitrary	
decisions	because	of	overlap	and,	in	some	cases,	lack	of	data.

The	consequences	of	PIDs	vary	widely	as	a	function	of	the	molecules	
that	are	defective.	This	concept	translates	into	multiple	levels	of	vulner-
ability	to	infection	by	pathogenic	and	opportunistic	microorganisms,	
ranging	 from	 extremely	 broad	 (as	 in	 severe	 combined	 immunodefi-
ciency	[SCID])	to	narrowly	restricted	to	a	single	microorganism	(as	in	
Mendelian	susceptibility	to	mycobacterial	disease	[MSMD]).	The	loca-
tions	of	the	sites	of	infection	and	the	causal	microorganisms	involved	
will	thus	help	physicians	arrive	at	proper	diagnoses.	PIDs	can	also	lead	
to	immunopathologic	responses	such	as	allergy	(as	in	Wiskott-Aldrich	
syndrome	[WAS]),	lymphoproliferation,	and	autoimmunity.	A	combi-
nation	 of	 recurrent	 infections,	 inflammation,	 and	 autoimmunity	 can	
be	 observed	 in	 a	 number	 of	 PIDs,	 thus	 creating	 obvious	 therapeutic	
challenges.	Finally,	some	PIDs	increase	the	risk	of	cancer,	notably	but	
not	exclusively	lymphocytic	cancers,	for	example,	lymphoma.

DIAGNOSIS OF PRIMARY 
IMMUNODEFICIENCIES
The	most	frequent	symptom	prompting	the	diagnosis	of	a	PID	is	the	
presence	 of	 recurrent	 or	 unusually	 severe	 infections.	 As	 mentioned	
above,	recurrent	allergic	or	autoimmune	manifestations	may	also	alert

the	physician	to	a	possible	diagnosis	of	PID.	In	such	cases,	a	detailed	
account	 of	 the	 subject’s	 personal	 and	 family	 medical	 history	 should	
be	obtained.	It	is	of	the	utmost	importance	to	gather	as	much	medical	
information	 as	 possible	 on	 relatives	 and	 up	 to	 several	 generations	 of	
ancestors.	In	addition	to	the	obvious	focus	on	primary	symptoms,	the	
clinical	examination	should	evaluate	the	size	of	lymphoid	organs	and,	
when	appropriate,	look	for	the	characteristic	signs	of	a	number	of	com-
plex	syndromes	that	may	be	associated	with	a	PID.

The	 performance	 of	 laboratory	 tests	 should	 be	 guided	 to	 some	
extent	by	the	clinical	findings.	Infections	of	the	respiratory	tract	(bron-
chi,	sinuses)	mostly	suggest	a	defective	antibody	response.	In	general,	
invasive	bacterial	infections	can	result	from	complement	deficiencies,	
signaling	 defects	 of	 innate	 immune	 responses,	 asplenia,	 or	 defective	
antibody	responses.	Viral	infections,	recurrent	Candida	infections,	and	
opportunistic	 infections	 are	 generally	 suggestive	 of	 impaired	 T-cell	
immunity.	Skin	infections	and	deep-seated	abscesses	primarily	reflect	
innate	 immune	 defects	 (such	 as	 chronic	 granulomatous	 disease);	
however,	they	may	also	appear	in	the	autosomal	dominant	hyper-IgE	
syndrome.	Table 351-2	summarizes	the	laboratory	tests	that	are	most	
frequently	used	to	diagnose	a	PID.	More	specific	tests	(notably	genetic	
tests)	are	then	used	to	make	a	definitive	diagnosis.	Genomic	tools	now	
allow	us	to	more	efficiently	track	genetic	defects	through	usage	of	gene	
panel	resequencing	and/or	whole	exome/genome	sequencing.

PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES OF THE 
INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM
PIDs	of	the	innate	immune	system	are	relatively	rare	and	account	for	
~10%	of	all	PIDs.
 ■ SEVERE CONGENITAL NEUTROPENIA
Severe	congenital	neutropenia	(SCN)	consists	of	a	group	of	inherited	
diseases	that	are	characterized	by	severely	impaired	neutrophil	counts	
(<500	polymorphonuclear	leukocytes	[PMN]/μL	of	blood).	The	con-
dition	is	usually	manifested	from	birth.	SCN	may	also	be	cyclic	(with	
a	 3-week	 periodicity),	 and	 other	 neutropenia	 syndromes	 can	 also	 be	
intermittent.	Although	the	most	frequent	inheritance	pattern	for	SCN	
is	 autosomal	 dominant,	 autosomal	 recessive	 and	 X-linked	 recessive	
conditions	 also	 exist.	 Bacterial	 infections	 at	 the	 interface	 between	
the	 body	 and	 the	 external	 milieu	 (e.g.,	 the	 orifices,	 wounds,	 and	 the	
respiratory	tract)	are	common	manifestations.	Bacterial	infections	can	
rapidly	progress	through	soft	tissue	and	are	followed	by	dissemination	
in	 the	 bloodstream.	 Severe	 visceral	 fungal	 infections	 can	 also	 ensue.	
The	absence	of	pus	is	a	hallmark	of	this	condition.

Diagnosis	of	SCN	requires	examination	of	the	bone	marrow.	Most	
SCNs	 are	 associated	 with	 a	 block	 in	 granulopoiesis	 at	 the	 promye-
locytic	 stage	 (Fig.	 351-1).	 SCN	 has	 multiple	 etiologies,	 and	 to	 date,	
mutations	 in	 21	 different	 genes	 have	 been	 identified.	 Most	 of	 these	
mutations	result	in	isolated	SCN,	whereas	others	are	syndromic	(Chap. 
64).	The	most	frequent	forms	of	SCN	are	caused	by	the	premature	cell	
death	of	granulocyte	precursors,	as	observed	in	deficiencies	of	GFI1,	
HAX1,	 and	 elastase	 2	 (ELANE),	 with	 the	 latter	 accounting	 for	 50%	
of	SCN	sufferers.	Certain	ELANE	mutations	cause	cyclic	neutropenia	
syndrome.	 A	 gain-of-function	 mutation	 in	 the	 WASP	 gene	 (see	 the

FIGURE 351-1  Differentiation of phagocytic cells and related primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate into common myeloid 
progenitors (CMPs) and then granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GM prog.), which, in turn, differentiate into neutrophils (MB: myeloblasts; Promyelo: promyelocytes; myelo: 
myelocytes) or monocytes (monoblasts and promonocytes). Upon activation, neutrophils adhere to the vascular endothelium, transmigrate, and phagocytose the targets. 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are delivered to the microorganism-containing phagosomes. Macrophages in tissues kill using the same mechanism. Following activation 
by interferon γ (not shown here), macrophages can be armed to kill intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria. For sake of simplicity, not all cell differentiation stages 
are shown. The abbreviations for PIDs are contained in boxes placed at corresponding stages of the pathway. CGD, chronic granulomatous diseases; GATA2, zinc finger

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disorderssection	 “Wiskott-Aldrich	 Syndrome”	 below)	 causes	 X-linked	 SCN,	
which	is	also	associated	with	monocytopenia.

As	 mentioned	 above,	 SCN	 exposes	 the	 patient	 to	 life-threatening,	
disseminated	bacterial	and	fungal	infections.	Treatment	requires	care-
ful	hygiene	measures,	notably	in	infants.	Later	in	life,	special	oral	and	
dental	care	is	essential,	along	with	the	prevention	of	bacterial	infection	
by	 prophylactic	 administration	 of	 trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.	
Subcutaneous	injection	of	the	cytokine	granulocyte	colony-stimulating	
factor	(G-CSF)	usually	improves	neutrophil	development	and	thus	pre-
vents	infection	in	most	SCN	diseases.	However,	there	are	two	caveats:	
(1)	a	few	cases	of	SCN	with	ELANE	mutation	are	refractory	to	G-CSF	
and	may	require	curative	treatment	via	allogeneic	hematopoietic	stem	
cell	transplantation	(HSCT);	and	(2)	a	subset	of	G-CSF-treated	patients	
carrying	 ELANE	 mutations	 are	 at	 a	 greater	 risk	 of	 developing	 acute	
myelogenous	leukemia	associated	(in	most	cases)	with	somatic	gain-of-
function	mutations	of	the	G-CSF	receptor	gene.

A	 few	 SCN	 conditions	 are	 associated	 with	 additional	 immune	
defects	 involving	 leukocyte	 migration	 as	 observed	 in	 the	 warts,	
hypogammaglobulinemia,	 infections,	 and	 myelokathexis	 (WHIM)	
syndrome	(gain-of-function	mutation	of	the	chemokine	CXCR4)	or	in	
moesin	deficiency.
 ■ ASPLENIA
Primary	 failure	 of	 the	 development	 of	 a	 spleen	 is	 an	 extremely	 rare	
disease	that	can	be	either	syndromic	(in	Ivemark	syndrome)	or	isolated	
with	an	autosomal	dominant	expression;	in	the	latter	case,	mutations	
in	the	ribosomal	protein	SA	were	recently	found.	Due	to	the	absence	
of	 natural	 filtration	 of	 microbes	 in	 the	 blood,	 asplenia	 predisposes	
affected	individuals	to	fulminant	infections	by	encapsulated	bacteria.	
Although	 most	 infections	 occur	 in	 the	 first	 years	 of	 life,	 cases	 may	
also	 arise	 in	 adulthood.	 The	 diagnosis	 is	 confirmed	 by	 abdominal	
ultrasonography	and	the	detection	of	Howell-Jolly	bodies	in	red	blood	
cells.	 Effective	 prophylactic	 measures	 (twice-daily	 oral	 penicillin	 and	
appropriate	vaccination	programs)	usually	prevent	fatal	outcomes.

 ■ GATA2 DEFICIENCY
Recently,	 an	 immunodeficiency	 combining	 monocytopenia	 and	 den-
dritic	 and	 lymphoid	 (B	 and	 natural	 killer	 [NK])	 cell	 deficiency	
(DCML),	also	called	monocytopenia	with	nontuberculous	mycobacte-
rial	infections	(mono-MAC),	has	been	described	as	a	consequence	of	a	
dominant	mutation	in	the	gene	GATA2,	a	transcription	factor	involved	
in	 hematopoiesis.	 This	 condition	 also	 predisposes	 to	 lymphedema,	
myelodysplasia,	and	acute	myeloid	leukemia.	Infections	(bacterial	and	
viral)	are	life-threatening,	thus	indicating,	together	with	the	malignant	
risk,	HSCT.

 ■ LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY
Leukocyte	 adhesion	 deficiency	 (LAD)	 consists	 of	 three	 autosomal	
recessive	conditions	(LAD	I,	II,	and	III)	(Chap. 64).	The	most	frequent	
condition	(LAD	I)	is	caused	by	mutations	in	the	β2	integrin	gene;	fol-
lowing	leukocyte	activation,	β2	integrins	mediate	adhesion	to	inflamed	
endothelium	expressing	cognate	ligands.	LAD	III	results	from	a	defect	
in	 a	 regulatory	 protein	 (kindlin,	 also	 known	 as	 Fermt	 3)	 involved	 in	
activating	the	ligand	affinity	of	β2	integrins.	The	extremely	rare	LAD	
II	condition	is	the	end	result	of	a	defect	in	selectin-mediated	leukocyte	
rolling	 that	 occurs	 prior	 to	 β2	 integrin	 binding.	 There	 is	 a	 primary	
defect	in	fucose	transporter	such	that	oligosaccharide	selectin	ligands	
are	missing	in	this	syndromic	condition.

Given	that	neutrophils	are	not	able	to	reach	infected	tissues,	LAD	
renders	 the	 individual	 susceptible	 to	 bacterial	 and	 fungal	 infections	
in	a	way	that	is	similar	to	that	of	patients	with	SCN.	LAD	also	causes	
impaired	 wound	 healing	 and	 delayed	 loss	 of	 the	 umbilical	 cord.	 A	
diagnosis	can	be	suspected	in	cases	of	pus-free	skin/tissue	infections	
and	 massive	 hyperleukocytosis	 (>30,000/μL)	 in	 the	 blood	 (mostly	
granulocytes).	Patients	with	LAD	III	also	develop	bleeding	because	the	
β2	integrin	in	platelets	is	not	functional.	Use	of	immunofluorescence	
and	functional	assays	to	detect	β2	integrin	can	help	form	a	diagnosis.	
Severe	forms	of	LAD	may	require	HSCT,	although	gene	therapy	is	also	
now	being	considered.	Neutrophil-specific	granule	deficiency	(a	very	

rare	condition	caused	by	a	mutation	in	the	gene	for	transcription	factor	
C/EBPα)	results	in	a	condition	that	is	clinically	similar	to	LAD.	Infre-
quent	additional	leukocyte	motility	defects	have	also	been	reported.

 ■ CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS DISEASES
Chronic	granulomatous	diseases	(CGDs)	are	characterized	by	impaired	
phagocytic	killing	of	microorganisms	by	neutrophils	and	macrophages	
(Chap. 64).	The	incidence	is	~1	per	200,000	live	births.	About	70%	of	
cases	are	associated	with	X-linked	recessive	inheritance	versus	autoso-
mal	inheritance	in	the	remaining	30%.	CGD	causes	deep-tissue	bacte-
rial	and	fungal	abscesses	in	macrophage-rich	organs	such	as	the	lymph	
nodes,	liver,	and	lungs.	Recurrent	skin	infections	(such	as	folliculitis)	
are	common	and	can	prompt	an	early	diagnosis	of	CGD.	The	infectious	
agents	 are	 typically	 catalase-positive	 bacteria	 (such	 as	 Staphylococcus 
aureus	and	Serratia marcescens)	but	also	include	Burkholderia cepacia,	
pathogenic	mycobacteria	(in	certain	regions	of	the	world),	and	fungi	
(mainly	filamentous	molds,	such	as	Aspergillus).

CGD	is	caused	by	defective	production	of	reactive	oxygen	species	
(ROS)	 in	 the	 phagolysosome	 membrane	 following	 phagocytosis	 of	
microorganisms.	It	results	from	the	lack	of	a	component	of	NADPH	
oxidase	(gp91phox	or	p22phox)	or	of	the	associated	adapter/activating	
proteins	(p47phox,	p67phox,	or	p40phox)	that	mediate	the	transport	
of	 electrons	 into	 the	 phagolysosome	 for	 creating	 ROS	 by	 interaction	
with	 O2.	 Under	 normal	 circumstances,	 these	 ROS	 either	 directly	 kill	
engulfed	microorganisms	or	enable	the	rise	in	pH	needed	to	activate	
the	phagosomal	proteases	that	contribute	to	microbial	killing.	Diagno-
sis	of	CGD	is	based	on	assays	of	ROS	production	in	neutrophils	and	
monocytes	(Table	351-2).	As	its	name	suggests,	CGD	is	also	a	granu-
lomatous	disease.	Macrophage-rich	granulomas	can	often	arise	in	the	
liver,	spleen,	and	other	organs.	These	are	sterile	granulomas	that	cause	
disease	by	obstruction	(bladder,	pylorus,	etc.)	or	protracted	inflamma-
tion	(colitis,	restrictive	lung	disease).

The	management	of	infections	in	patients	with	CGD	can	be	a	com-
plex	 process.	 The	 treatment	 of	 bacterial	 infections	 is	 generally	 based	
on	combination	therapy	with	antibiotics	that	are	able	to	penetrate	into	
cells.	The	treatment	of	fungal	infections	requires	aggressive,	long-term	
use	 of	 antifungals.	 Inflammatory/granulomatous	 lesions	 are	 usually	
steroid-sensitive,	 but	 often	 become	 glucocorticoid-dependent;	 liver	
abscesses	are	best	managed	by	administering	antibiotics	together	with	
glucocorticoids.

The	 treatment	 of	 CGD	 mostly	 relies	 on	 preventing	 infections.	 It		
has	 been	 unambiguously	 demonstrated	 that	 prophylactic	 usage	 of	
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole	is	both	well	tolerated	and	highly	effec-
tive	 in	 reducing	 the	 risk	 of	 bacterial	 infection.	 Daily	 administration	
of	azole	derivatives	(notably	itraconazole)	also	reduces	the	frequency	
of	 fungal	 complications.	 It	 has	 long	 been	 suggested	 that	 interferon	 γ	
administration	 is	 helpful,	 although	 medical	 experts	 continue	 to	 dis-
agree	 over	 this	 controversial	 issue.	 Patients	 may	 do	 reasonably	 well	
for	 some	 time	 with	 prophylaxis	 and	 careful	 management.	 However,	
patients	are	at	high	risk	lifelong	of	severe	and	persistent	fungal	infec-
tions	and/or	chronic	inflammatory	complications,	leading	to	consider-
ation	of	performing	HSCT.	Due	to	an	increase	in	reported	successes,	
HSCT	is	now	an	established	curative	approach	for	CGD;	however,	the	
risk-versus-benefit	ratio	must	be	carefully	assessed	on	a	case-by-case	
basis.	Gene	therapy	approaches	are	also	being	evaluated.

 ■ MENDELIAN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO 
MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASE
This	group	of	diseases	is	characterized	by	a	defect	in	the	interleukin-12	
(IL-12)–interferon	 (IFN)	 γ	 axis	 (including	 IL-12p40,	 IL-12	 receptor	
[R]	 β1	 and	 β2,	 IFN-γ	 R1	 and	 R2,	 TYK2,	 STAT1,	 IRF8,	 and	 ISG515	
deficiencies),	 which	 ultimately	 leads	 to	 impaired	 IFN-γ-dependent	
macrophage	 activation.	 Both	 recessive	 and	 dominant	 inheritance	
modes	have	been	observed.	The	hallmark	of	this	PID	is	a	specific	and	
relatively	 narrow	 vulnerability	 to	 tuberculous	 and	 nontuberculous	
mycobacteria.	 The	 most	 severe	 phenotype	 (as	 observed	 in	 complete	
IFN-γ	receptor	deficiency)	is	characterized	by	disseminated	infection	
that	can	be	fatal	even	when	aggressive	and	appropriate	antimycobacte-
rial	therapy	is	applied.	In	addition	to	mycobacterial	infections,	MSMD

patients	(and	particularly	those	with	an	IL-12/IL-12R	deficiency)	are	
prone	to	developing	Salmonella	infections.	Although	MSMDs	are	very	
rare,	 they	 should	 be	 considered	 in	 any	 patient	 with	 persistent	 myco-
bacterial	 infection.	 Treatment	 with	 IFN-γ	 may	 efficiently	 bypass	 an	
IL-12/IL-12R	 deficiency.	 HSCT	 is	 a	 therapeutic	 option	 for	 the	 most	
severe	cases.

 ■ TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR (TLR) PATHWAY 
DEFICIENCIES
In	a	certain	group	of	patients	with	early-onset,	invasive	Streptococcus 
pneumoniae	 infections	 or	 (less	 frequently)	 Staphylococcus  aureus	 or	
other	 pyogenic	 infections,	 conventional	 screening	 for	 PIDs	 does	 not	
identify	the	cause	of	the	defect	in	host	defense.	It	has	been	established	
that	 these	 patients	 carry	 recessive	 mutations	 in	 genes	 that	 encode	
essential	 adaptor	 molecules	 (IRAK4	 and	 MYD88)	 involved	 in	 the	
signaling	 pathways	 of	 the	 majority	 of	 known	 TLRs	 (Chap.  349).	
Remarkably,	 susceptibility	 to	 infection	 appears	 to	 decrease	 after	 the	
first	few	years	of	life—perhaps	an	indication	that	adaptive	immunity	
(once	triggered	by	an	initial	microbial	challenge)	is	then	able	to	prevent	
recurrent	infections.

Certain	TLRs	(TLR-3,	-7,	-8,	and	-9)	are	involved	in	the	recognition	
of	RNA	and	DNA	and	usually	become	engaged	during	viral	infections.	
Very	 specific	 susceptibility	 to	 herpes	 simplex	 encephalitis	 has	 been	
described	in	patients	with	a	deficiency	in	Unc93b	(a	molecule	associated	
with	TLR-3,	-7,	-8,	and	-9	required	for	correct	subcellular	localization),	
TLR-3,	 or	 associated	 signaling	 molecules	 TRIF,	 TBK1,	 and	 TRAF3,	
resulting	in	defective	type	I	IFN	production.	The	fact	that	no	other	TLR	
deficiencies	 have	 been	 found—despite	 extensive	 screening	 of	 patients	
with	 unexplained,	 recurrent	 infections—strongly	 suggests	 that	 these	
receptors	 are	 functionally	 redundant.	 Hypo-
morphic	mutations	in	NEMO/IKK-γ	(a	mem-
ber	 of	 the	 NF-κB	 complex,	 which	 is	 activated	
downstream	 of	 TLR	 receptors)	 lead	 to	 a	 com-
plex,	variable	immunodeficiency	and	a	number	
of	 associated	 features.	 Susceptibility	 to	 both	
invasive,	pyogenic	infections	and	mycobacteria	
may	be	observed	in	this	particular	setting.

Lastly,	deficiencies	of	any	complement	component	involved	in	the	
lytic	 phase	 (C5,	 C6,	 C7,	 C8,	 and,	 to	 a	 lesser	 extent,	 C9)	 predispose	
affected	individuals	to	systemic	infection	by	Neisseria.	This	is	explained	
by	the	critical	role	of	complement	in	the	lysis	of	the	thick	cell	wall	pos-
sessed	by	this	class	of	bacteria.

Diagnosis	 of	 a	 complement	 deficiency	 relies	 primarily	 on	 testing	
the	 status	 of	 the	 classic	 and	 alternate	 pathway	 via	 functional	 assays,	
that	 is,	 the	 CH50	 and	 AP50	 tests,	 respectively.	 When	 either	 pathway	
is	 profoundly	 impaired,	 determination	 of	 the	 status	 of	 the	 relevant	
components	in	that	pathway	enables	a	precise	diagnosis.	Appropriate	
vaccinations	 and	 daily	 administration	 of	 oral	 penicillin	 are	 efficient	
means	of	preventing	recurrent	infections.	It	is	noteworthy	that	several	
complement	 deficiencies	 (in	 the	 classic	 pathway	 and	 the	 lytic	 phase)	
may	 also	 predispose	 affected	 individuals	 to	 autoimmune	 diseases	
(notably	systemic	lupus	erythematosus;	Chap. 356).

PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES OF THE 
ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM
 ■ T LYMPHOCYTE DEFICIENCIES (TABLE 351-1, 
FIGS. 351-2 AND 351-3)
Given	the	central	role	of	T	lymphocytes	in	adaptive	immune	responses	
(Chap. 349),	 PIDs	 involving	 T	 cells	 generally	 have	 severe	 pathologic	
consequences;	 this	 explains	 the	 poor	 overall	 prognosis	 and	 the	 need	
for	 early	 diagnosis	 and	 the	 early	 intervention	 with	 appropriate	 ther-
apy.	 Several	 differentiation	 pathways	 of	 T-cell	 effectors	 have	 been	
described,	 one	 or	 all	 of	 which	 may	 be	 affected	 by	 a	 given	 PID	 (Fig.	
351-2).	Follicular	helper	CD4+	T	cells	in	germinal	centers	are	required	
for	 T-dependent	 antibody	 production,	 including	 the	 generation	 of	

Rare	 cases	 of	 predisposition	 to	 severe	 viral	
infections	(influenza,	live	measles	vaccine)	have	
been	found	in	patients	with	genetic	defects	in	
IFN	type	I	receptor	and	signaling	pathways.

 ■ COMPLEMENT DEFICIENCY
The	complement	system	is	composed	of	a	com-
plex	 cascade	 of	 plasma	 proteins	 (Chap.  349)	
that	leads	to	the	deposition	of	C3b	fragments	
on	 the	 surface	 of	 particles	 and	 the	 formation	
of	 immune	 complexes	 that	 can	 culminate	 in	
the	 activation	 of	 a	 lytic	 complex	 at	 the	 bac-
terial	 surface.	 C3	 cleavage	 can	 be	 mediated	
via	 three	 pathways:	 the	 classic,	 alternate,	 and	
lectin	pathways.	C3b	coats	particles	as	part	of	
the	opsonization	process	that	facilitates	phago-
cytosis	following	binding	to	cognate	receptors.	
A	 deficiency	 in	 any	 component	 of	 the	 classic	
pathway	(C1q,	C1r,	C1s,	C4,	and	C2)	can	pre-
dispose	 an	 individual	 to	 bacterial	 infections	
that	 are	 tissue-invasive	 or	 that	 occur	 in	 the	
respiratory	 tract.	 Likewise,	 a	 C3	 deficiency	
or	a	deficiency	in	factor	I	(a	protein	that	reg-
ulates	 C3	 consumption,	 thus	 leading	 to	 a	 C3	
deficiency	 due	 to	 its	 absence)	 also	 results	 in	
the	 same	 type	 of	 vulnerability	 to	 infection.	
It	 has	 recently	 been	 reported	 that	 a	 very	 rare	
deficiency	 in	 ficolin-3	 predisposes	 affected	
individuals	to	bacterial	infections.	Deficiencies

Ig	 class-switched,	 high-affinity	 antibodies.	 CD4+	 TH1	 cells	 provide	
cytokine-dependent	 (mostly	 IFN-γ-dependent)	 help	 to	 macrophages	
for	intracellular	killing	of	various	microorganisms,	including	mycobac-
teria	and	Salmonella.	CD4+	TH2	cells	produce	IL-4,	IL-5,	and	IL-13	and	
thus	recruit	and	activate	eosinophils	and	other	cells	required	to	fight	
helminth	infections.	CD4+	TH17	cells	produce	IL-17	and	IL-22	cytok-
ines	that	recruit	neutrophils	to	the	skin	and	lungs	to	fight	bacterial	and	
fungal	infections.	Cytotoxic	CD8+	T	cells	can	kill	infected	cells,	notably	
in	the	context	of	viral	infections.	In	addition,	certain	T-cell	deficiencies	
predispose	affected	individuals	to	Pneumocystis jiroveci	lung	infections	
early	in	life	and	to	chronic	gut/biliary	duct/liver	infections	by	Crypto-
sporidium	and	related	genera	later	on	in	life.	Lastly,	naturally	occurring	
or	induced	regulatory	T	cells	are	essential	for	controlling	inflammation	
(notably	reactivity	to	commensal	bacteria	in	the	gut)	and	autoimmu-
nity.	The	role	of	other	T-cell	subsets	with	limited	T-cell	receptor	(TCR)	
diversity	 (such	 as	 γδTCR	 T	 cells	 or	 natural	 killer	 T	 [NKT]	 cells)	 in	
PIDs	is	less	well	known;	however,	these	subsets	can	be	defective	in	cer-
tain	PIDs,	and	this	finding	can	sometimes	contribute	to	the	diagnosis	
(e.g.,	NKT-cell	deficiency	in	X-linked	proliferative	syndrome	[XLP]).	
T-cell	deficiencies	account	for	~20%	of	all	cases	of	PID.

Severe  Combined  Immunodeficiencies  SCIDs	 constitute	 a	
group	of	rare	PIDs	characterized	by	a	profound	block	in	T-cell	devel-
opment	 and	 thus	 the	 complete	 absence	 of	 these	 cells.	 The	 develop-
mental	block	is	always	the	consequence	of	an	intrinsic	deficiency.	The	
incidence	of	SCID	is	estimated	to	be	1	in	50,000	live	births.	Given	the	
severity	 of	 the	 T-cell	 deficiency,	 clinical	 consequences	 occur	 early	 in	
life	 (usually	 within	 3–6	 months	 of	 birth).	 The	 most	 frequent	 clinical	
manifestations	 are	 recurrent	 oral	 candidiasis,	 failure	 to	 thrive,	 and

bacterial	infections	can	also	occur.	Patients	may	also	experience	com-
plications	related	to	infections	caused	by	live	vaccines	(notably	bacille

A	 diagnosis	 of	 SCID	 can	 be	 suspected	
based	 on	 the	 patient’s	 clinical	 history	
and,	possibly,	a	family	history	of	deaths	in	
very	young	children	(suggestive	of	either	
X-linked	or	recessive	inheritance).	Lym-
phocytopenia	 is	 strongly	 suggestive	 of	
SCID	in	>90%	of	cases	(Table	351-2).	The	
absence	 of	 a	 thymic	 shadow	 on	 a	 chest	
x-ray	 can	 also	 be	 suggestive	 of	 SCID.	
An	 accurate	 diagnosis	 relies	 on	 precise	
determination	 of	 the	 number	 of	 circu-
lating	 T,	 B,	 and	 NK	 lymphocytes	 and	
their	subsets.	T-cell	lymphopenia	may	be	
masked	in	some	patients	by	the	presence	
of	maternal	T	cells	(derived	from	mater-
nal-fetal	 blood	 transfers)	 that	 cannot	 be	
eliminated.	 Although	 counts	 are	 usually	
low	(<500/μL	of	blood),	higher	maternal	
T-cell	 counts	 may,	 under	 some	 circum-
stances,	 initially	 mask	 the	 presence	 of	
SCID.	Thus,	screening	for	maternal	cells	
by	using	adequate	genetic	markers	should	
be	performed	whenever	necessary.	Inher-
itance	 pattern	 analysis	 and	 lymphocyte	
phenotyping	 can	 discriminate	 between	
various	forms	of	SCID	and	provide	guid-
ance	in	the	choice	of	accurate	molecular	
diagnostic	tests	(see	below).	To	date,	five	
distinct	 causative	 mechanisms	 for	 SCID	
(Fig.	 351-3)	 have	 been	 identified.	 T-cell	
quantification	of	receptor	excision	circles	
(TREC)	by	using	the	Guthrie	card	is	a	reliable	diagnostic	test	for	new-
born	screening.	It	is	now	operational	in	the	United	States	and	several	
other	 countries	 worldwide.	 Its	 more	 widespread	 use	 will	 lead	 to	 the	
provision	of	therapy	(see	below)	to	uninfected	patients	resulting	in	a	
maximal	chance	of	cure.

B

SEVERE  COMBINED  IMMUNODEFICIENCY  CAUSED  BY  A  CYTOKINE- 
SIGNALING  DEFICIENCY  The	 most	 frequent	 SCID	 phenotype	
(accounting	for	30–40%	of	all	cases)	is	the	absence	of	both	T	and	NK	
cells.	This	outcome	results	from	a	deficiency	in	either	the	common	γ	
chain	(γc)	receptor	that	is	shared	by	several	cytokine	receptors	(the	IL-2,	
-4,	-7,	-9,	-15,	and	-21	receptors)	or	Jak-associated	kinase	(JAK)	3	that	
binds	to	the	cytoplasmic	portion	of	the	γc	chain	receptor	and	induces	
signal	 transduction	 following	 cytokine	 binding.	 The	 former	 form	 of	
SCID	(γc	deficiency)	has	an	X-linked	inheritance	mode,	while	the	sec-
ond	is	autosomal	recessive.	A	lack	of	the	IL-7Rα	chain	(which,	together	
with	γc,	forms	the	IL-7	receptor)	induces	a	selective	T-cell	deficiency.

PURINE  METABOLISM  DEFICIENCY  Ten	 to	 20%	 of	 SCID	 patients	
exhibit	 a	 deficiency	 in	 adenosine	 deaminase	 (ADA),	 an	 enzyme	 of	
purine	 metabolism	 that	 deaminates	 adenosine	 (ado)	 and	 deoxyade-
nosine	(dAdo).	An	ADA	deficiency	results	in	the	accumulation	of	ado	
and	dAdo	metabolites	that	induce	premature	cell	death	of	lymphocyte	
progenitors.	 The	 condition	 results	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 B	 and	 NK	 lym-
phocytes	as	well	as	T	cells.	The	clinical	expression	of	complete	ADA	
deficiency	typically	occurs	very	early	in	life.	Since	ADA	is	a	ubiquitous	
enzyme,	 its	 deficiency	 can	 also	 cause	 bone	 dysplasia	 with	 abnormal	
costochondral	junctions	and	metaphyses	(found	in	50%	of	cases)	and	
neurologic	 defects.	 The	 very	 rare	 purine	 nucleoside	 phosphorylase	
(PNP)	deficiency	causes	a	profound	although	incomplete	T-cell	defi-
ciency	that	is	often	associated	with	severe	neurologic	impairments.

DEFECTIVE  REARRANGEMENTS  OF  T-  AND  B-CELL  RECEPTORS  A	
series	of	SCID	conditions	are	characterized	by	a	selective	deficiency	in	
T	and	B	lymphocytes	with	autosomal	recessive	inheritance.	These	con-
ditions	account	for	20–30%	of	SCID	cases	and	result	from	mutations	
in	genes	encoding	proteins	that	mediate	the	recombination	of	V(D)J	
gene	elements	in	T-	and	B-cell	antigen	receptor	genes	(required	for	the

2714 generation	of	diversity	in	antigen	recognition).	The	main	deficiencies	
involve	 RAG1,	 RAG2,	 DNA-dependent	 protein	 kinase,	 and	 Artemis.	
A	less	severe	(albeit	variable)	immunologic	phenotype	can	result	from	
other	 deficiencies	 in	 the	 same	 pathway,	 that	 is,	 DNA	 ligase	 4	 and	
Cernunnos	deficiencies.	Given	that	these	latter	factors	are	involved	in	
DNA	repair,	these	deficiencies	may	also	cause	developmental	defects.
DEFECTIVE  (PRE-)T-CELL  RECEPTOR  SIGNALING  IN  THE  THYMUS  A	
selective	T-cell	defect	can	be	caused	by	a	series	of	rare	deficiencies	in	
molecules	 involved	 in	 signaling	 via	 the	 pre-TCR	 or	 the	 TCR.	 These	
include	 deficiencies	 in	 CD3	 subunits	 associated	 with	 the	 (pre-)TCR	
(i.e.,	CD3δ,	ε,	and	ζ)	and	CD45.
RETICULAR DYSGENESIS  Reticular	dysgenesis	is	an	extremely	rare	form	
of	SCID	that	causes	T	and	NK	deficiencies	with	severe	neutropenia	and	
sensorineural	deafness.	It	results	from	an	adenylate	kinase	2	deficiency.	
RAC-2	gain	of	function	can	cause	the	same	immunologic	phenotype.

Patients	 with	 SCID	 require	 appropriate	 care	 with	 aggressive	 anti-	
infective	 therapies,	 immunoglobulin	 replacement,	 and	 (when	 neces-
sary)	 parenteral	 nutrition	 support.	 In	 most	 cases,	 curative	 treatment	
relies	on	HSCT.	Today,	HSCT	provides	a	very	high	curative	potential	
for	 SCID	 patients	 who	 are	 otherwise	 in	 reasonably	 good	 condition.	
Gene	 therapy	 has	 been	 found	 to	 be	 successful	 for	 cases	 of	 X-linked	
SCID	(γc	deficiency)	and	SCID	caused	by	an	ADA	deficiency.	Lastly,	
a	third	option	for	the	treatment	of	ADA	deficiency	consists	of	enzyme	
substitution	with	a	pegylated	enzyme.

Thymic  Defects  A	 profound	 T-cell	 defect	 can	 also	 result	 from	
faulty	 development	 of	 the	 thymus,	 as	 is	 most	 often	 observed	 in	 rare	
cases	of	DiGeorge’s	syndrome—a	relatively	common	condition	leading	
to	a	constellation	of	developmental	defects.	In	~1%	of	such	cases,	the	
thymus	 is	 completely	 absent,	 leading	 to	 virtually	 no	 mature	 T	 cells.	
However,	 expansion	 of	 oligoclonal	 T	 cells	 can	 occur	 and	 is	 associ-
ated	 with	 skin	 lesions.	 Diagnosis	 (using	 immunofluorescence	 in	 situ	
hybridization)	is	based	on	the	identification	of	a	hemizygous	deletion	
in	the	long	arm	of	chromosome	22.	To	recover	the	capability	for	T-cell	
differentiation,	these	cases	require	a	thymic	graft.	CHARGE	(coloboma	
of	the	eye,	heart	anomaly,	choanal	atresia,	retardation,	genital,	and	ear	
anomalies)	 syndrome	 (CHD7	 deficiency)	 is	 a	 less	 frequent	 cause	 of	
impaired	 thymus	 development.	 Lastly,	 the	 very	 rare	 “nude”	 defect	 is	
characterized	by	the	absence	of	both	hair	and	the	thymus.
Omenn Syndrome  Omenn syndrome	consists	of	a	subset	of	T-cell	
deficiencies	 that	 present	 with	 a	 unique	 phenotype,	 including	 early-	
onset	 erythroderma,	 alopecia,	 hepatosplenomegaly,	 and	 failure	 to	
thrive.	 These	 patients	 usually	 display	 T-cell	 lymphocytosis,	 eosino-
philia,	and	low	B-cell	counts.	It	has	been	found	that	the	T	cells	of	these	
patients	 exhibit	 a	 low	 TCR	 heterogeneity.	 This	 peculiar	 syndrome	 is	
the	 consequence	 of	 hypomorphic	 mutations	 in	 genes	 usually	 associ-
ated	with	SCID,	that	is,	RAG1,	RAG2,	or	(less	frequently)	ARTEMIS	or	
IL-7Rα.	The	impaired	homeostasis	of	differentiating	T	cells	thus	causes	
this	immune	system–associated	disease.	These	patients	are	very	fragile,	
requiring	simultaneous	anti-infective	therapy,	nutritional	support,	and	
immunosuppression.	HSCT	provides	a	curative	approach.

Functional T-Cell Defects (Fig. 351-2)  A	subset	of	T-cell	PIDs	
with	 autosomal	 inheritance	 is	 characterized	 by	 partially	 preserved	
T-cell	 differentiation	 but	 defective	 activation	 resulting	 in	 abnormal	
effector	function.	There	are	many	causes	of	these	defects,	but	all	lead	
to	susceptibility	to	viral	and	opportunistic	infections,	chronic	diarrhea,	
and	 failure	 to	 thrive,	 with	 onset	 during	 childhood	 often	 associated	
with	 autoimmune	 manifestations.	 Careful	 phenotyping	 and	 in	 vitro	
functional	assays	are	required	to	identify	these	diseases,	the	best	char-
acterized	of	which	are	the	following.
ZETA-ASSOCIATED  PROTEIN  70  (ZAP70)  DEFICIENCY  Zeta-associated	
protein	70	(ZAP70)	is	recruited	to	the	TCR	following	antigen	recogni-
tion.	A	ZAP70	deficiency	leads	typically	to	an	almost	complete	absence	
of	CD8+	T	cells;	CD4+	T	cells	are	present	but	cannot	be	activated	in	
vitro	by	TCR	stimulation.
CALCIUM  SIGNALING  DEFECTS  A	 small	 number	 of	 patients	 have	
been	reported	who	exhibit	a	profound	defect	in	in	vitro	T-	and	B-cell	

activation	 as	 a	 result	 of	 defective	 antigen	 receptor-mediated	 Ca2+	
influx.	This	defect	is	caused	by	a	mutation	in	the	calcium	channel	gene	
(ORAI1)	or	its	activator	(STIM-1).	It	is	noteworthy	that	these	patients	
are	also	prone	to	autoimmune	manifestations	(blood	cytopenias)	and	
exhibit	a	nonprogressive	muscle	disease.

HUMAN LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN (HLA) CLASS II DEFICIENCY  Defective	
expression	of	HLA	class	II	molecules	is	the	hallmark	of	a	group	of	four	
recessive	genetic	defects	all	of	which	affect	molecules	(RFX5,	RFXAP,	
RFXANK,	and	CIITA)	involved	in	the	transactivation	of	the	genes	cod-
ing	for	HLA	class	II.	As	a	result,	low	but	variable	CD4+	T-cell	counts	
are	 observed	 in	 addition	 to	 defective	 antigen-specific	 T-	 and	 B-cell	
responses.	 These	 patients	 are	 particularly	 susceptible	 to	 herpesvirus,	
adenovirus,	 and	 enterovirus	 infections	 and	 chronic	 gut/liver	 Crypto-
sporidium	infections.
HLA CLASS I DEFICIENCY  Defective	expression	of	molecules	involved	
in	antigen	presentation	by	HLA	class	I	molecules	(i.e.,	TAP-1,	TAP-2,	
and	Tapasin)	leads	to	reduced	CD8+	T-cell	counts,	loss	of	HLA	class	
I	antigen	expression,	and	a	particular	phenotype	consisting	of	chronic	
obstructive	pulmonary	disease	and	severe	vasculitis.

OTHER DEFECTS  A	variety	of	other	T-cell	PIDs	have	been	described,	
some	 of	 which	 are	 associated	 with	 a	 precise	 molecular	 defect	 (e.g.,	
IL-2-inducible	T-cell	kinase	[ITK]	deficiency;	CD27,	CD70,	IL-21,	and	
IL-21	 receptor	 deficiencies;	 CARD11	 deficiency;	 MALT1	 deficiency;	
BCL10	deficiency;	DOCK2	deficiency;	RORC	deficiency;	RLTPR	defi-
ciency).	These	conditions	are	also	characterized	by	profound	vulnera-
bility	to	infections,	such	as	severe	Epstein-Barr	virus	(EBV)–induced	
B-cell	 proliferation	 and	 autoimmune	 disorders.	 Milder	 phenotypes	
are	associated	with	CD8	and	CD3γ	deficiencies.	Combined	immuno-
deficiency	associated	with	anhidrotic	ectodermic	dysplasia	is	the	con-
sequence	 of	 defects	 in	 the	 NF-κB	 signaling	 pathway	 (X-linked	 IKKγ	
deficiency	and	gain-of-function	IKbα).

HSCT	is	indicated	for	most	of	these	diseases,	although	the	prognosis	
is	worse	than	in	SCID	because	many	patients	are	chronically	infected	
at	 the	 time	 of	 diagnosis.	 Fairly	 aggressive	 immunosuppression	 and	
myeloablation	may	be	necessary	to	achieve	engraftment	of	allogeneic	
stem	cells.

T-Cell  Primary  Immunodeficiencies  with  DNA  Repair 
Defects  This	is	a	group	of	PIDs	characterized	by	a	combination	of	
T-	and	B-cell	defects	of	variable	intensity,	together	with	a	number	of	
nonimmunologic	features	resulting	from	DNA	fragility.	The	autosomal	
recessive	 disorder	 ataxia-telangiectasia	 (AT)	 is	 the	 most	 frequently	
encountered	 condition	 in	 this	 group.	 It	 has	 an	 incidence	 of	 1:40,000	
live	births	and	causes	B-cell	defects	(low	IgA,	IgG2	deficiency,	and	low	
antibody	 production),	 which	 often	 require	 immunoglobulin	 replace-
ment.	 AT	 is	 associated	 with	 a	 progressive	 T-cell	 immunodeficiency.	
As	 the	 name	 suggests,	 the	 hallmark	 features	 of	 AT	 are	 telangiectasia	
and	cerebellar	ataxia.	The	latter	manifestations	may	not	be	detectable	
before	the	age	of	3–4	years,	so	that	AT	should	be	considered	in	young	
children	with	IgA	deficiency	and	recurrent	and	problematic	infections.	
Diagnosis	is	based	on	a	cytogenetic	analysis	showing	excessive	chro-
mosomal	 rearrangements	 (mostly	 affecting	 chromosomes	 7	 and	 14)	
in	lymphocytes.	AT	is	caused	by	a	mutation	in	the	gene	encoding	the	
ATM	protein—a	kinase	that	plays	an	important	role	in	the	detection	
and	repair	of	DNA	lesions	(or	cell	death	if	the	lesions	are	too	numer-
ous)	by	triggering	several	different	pathways.	Overall,	AT	is	a	progres-
sive	disease	that	carries	a	very	high	risk	of	lymphoma,	leukemia,	and	
(during	adulthood)	carcinomas.	A	variant	of	AT	(“AT-like	disease”)	is	
caused	by	mutation	in	the	MRE11	gene.

Nijmegen breakage syndrome	(NBS)	is	a	less	common	condition	that	
also	 results	 from	 chromosome	 instability	 (with	 the	 same	 cytogenetic	
abnormalities	as	in	AT).	NBS	is	characterized	by	a	severe	T-	and	B-cell	
combined	 immune	 deficiency	 with	 autosomal	 recessive	 inheritance.	
Individuals	 with	 NBS	 exhibit	 microcephaly	 and	 a	 bird-like	 face	 but	
have	neither	ataxia	nor	telangiectasia.	The	risk	of	malignancies	is	very	
high.	NBS	results	from	a	deficiency	in	nibrin	(NBSI,	a	protein	associ-
ated	with	MRE11	and	Rad50	that	is	involved	in	checking	DNA	lesions)	
caused	by	hypomorphic	mutations.

Severe	 forms	 of	 dyskeratosis  congenita	 (also	 known	 as	 Hoyeraal-	
Hreidarsson	 syndrome)	 combine	 a	 progressive	 immunodeficiency	
that	 can	 also	 include	 an	 absence	 of	 B	 and	 NK	 lymphocytes,	 pro-
gressive	 bone	 marrow	 failure,	 microcephaly,	 in	 utero	 growth	 retar-
dation,	 and	 gastrointestinal	 disease.	 The	 disease	 can	 be	 X-linked	
or,	 more	 rarely,	 autosomal	 recessive.	 It	 is	 caused	 by	 the	 mutation	 of	
genes	 encoding	 telomere	 maintenance	 proteins,	 including	 dyskerin		
(DKC1).

Finally,	 immunodeficiency  with  centromeric  and  facial  anomalies	
(ICF)	is	a	complex	syndrome	of	autosomal	recessive	inheritance	that	
variably	combines	a	mild	T-cell	immune	deficiency	with	a	more	severe	
B-cell	 immune	 deficiency,	 coarse	 face,	 digestive	 disease,	 and	 mild	
mental	 retardation.	 A	 diagnostic	 feature	 is	 the	 detection	 by	 cytoge-
netic	 analysis	 of	 multiradial	 aspects	 in	 multiple	 chromosomes	 (most	
frequently	1,	9,	and	16)	corresponding	to	an	abnormal	DNA	structure	
secondary	 to	 defective	 DNA	 methylation.	 It	 is	 the	 consequence	 of	 a	
deficiency	 in	 most	 cases	 in	 the	 DNA	 methyltransferase	 DNMT3B,	
ZBTB24,	CDCA7,	or	HELLS.

T-Cell Primary Immunodeficiencies with Hyper-IgE  Several	
T-cell	PIDs	are	associated	with	elevated	serum	IgE	levels	(as	in	Omenn	
syndrome).	A	condition	sometimes	referred	to	as	autosomal recessive 
hyper-IgE  syndrome	 is	 notably	 characterized	 by	 recurrent	 bacterial	
infections	in	the	skin	and	respiratory	tract	and	severe	skin	and	mucosal	
infections	by	pox	viruses	and	human	papillomaviruses,	together	with	
severe	 allergic	 manifestations.	 T	 and	 B	 lymphocyte	 counts	 are	 low.	
Mutations	 in	 the	 DOCK8	 gene	 have	 been	 found	 in	 many	 of	 these	
patients.	This	condition	is	an	indication	for	HSCT.

A	very	rare,	related	condition	with	autosomal	recessive	inheritance	
that	causes	a	similar	susceptibility	to	infection	with	various	microbes	
(see	 above),	 including	 mycobacteria,	 reportedly	 results	 from	 a	 defi-
ciency	in	Tyk-2,	a	JAK	family	kinase	involved	in	the	signaling	of	many	
different	cytokine	receptors.

Autosomal Dominant Hyper-IgE Syndrome  This	unique	con-
dition,	 the	 autosomal  dominant  hyper-IgE  syndrome,	 is	 usually	 diag-
nosed	by	the	combination	of	recurrent	skin	and	lung	infections	that	can	
be	 complicated	 by	 pneumatoceles.	 Infections	 are	 caused	 by	 pyogenic	
bacteria	and	fungi.	Several	other	manifestations	characterize	hyper-IgE	
syndrome,	including	facial	dysmorphy,	defective	loss	of	primary	teeth,	
hyperextensibility,	scoliosis,	and	osteoporosis.	Elevated	serum	IgE	levels	
are	 typical	 of	 this	 syndrome.	 Defective	 TH17	 effector	 responses	 have	
been	shown	to	account	at	least	in	part	for	the	specific	patterns	of	suscep-
tibility	to	particular	microbes.	This	condition	is	caused	by	a	heterozy-
gous	(dominant)	mutation	in	the	gene	encoding	the	transcription	factor	
STAT3	 that	 is	 required	 in	 a	 number	 of	 signaling	 pathways	 following	
binding	of	cytokine	to	cytokine	receptors	(such	as	that	of	IL-6	and	the	
IL-6	receptor).	It	also	results	in	partially	defective	antibody	production	
because	of	defective	IL-21	receptor	signaling.	Hence,	immunoglobulin	
substitution	can	be	considered	as	prophylaxis	of	bacterial	infections.

Most	 recently,	 a	 recessive	 condition	 that	 mimics	 immunologic	
aspects	of	hyper-IgE	syndrome	has	been	ascribed	to	ZNF341	deficiency.

Cartilage Hair Hypoplasia  The	autosomal	recessive	cartilage hair 
hypoplasia	 (CHH)	 disease	 is	 characterized	 by	 short-limb	 dwarfism,	
metaphyseal	 dysostosis,	 and	 sparse	 hair,	 together	 with	 a	 combined	 T-	
and	B-cell	PID	of	extremely	variable	intensity	(ranging	from	quasi-SCID	
to	 no	 clinically	 significant	 immune	 defects).	 The	 condition	 can	 pre-
dispose	to	erythroblastopenia,	autoimmunity,	and	tumors.	It	is	caused	
by	mutations	in	the	RMRP	gene	for	a	noncoding	ribosome-associated	
RNA.	Schimke	immuno-osseous	dysplasia	is	another	autosomal	reces-
sive	condition	variably	associating	combined	immunodeficiency,	bone	
disease,	and	more	importantly	severe	nephropathy.

CD40  Ligand  and  CD40  Deficiencies  Hyper-IgM  syndrome	
(HIGM)	 is	 a	 well-known	 PID	 that	 is	 usually	 classified	 as	 a	 B-cell	
immune	deficiency	(see	Fig. 351-4	and	below).	It	results	from	defective

FIGURE 351-4  B-cell differentiation and related primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate into common lymphoid progenitors 
(CLPs), which give rise to pre-B cells. The B-cell differentiation pathway goes through the pre–B-cell stage (expression of the μ heavy chain and surrogate light chain), the 
immature B-cell stage (expression of surface IgM), and the mature B-cell stage (expression of surface IgM and IgD). The main phenotypic characteristics of these cells are 
indicated. In lymphoid organs, B cells can differentiate into plasma cells and produce IgM or undergo (in germinal centers) Ig class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic 
mutation of the variable region of V genes (SHM) that enable selection of high-affinity antibodies. These B cells produce antibodies of various isotypes and generate memory 
B cells. PIDs are indicated in the purple boxes. CVID, common variable immunodeficiency.

2716 immunoglobulin	 class	 switch	 recombination	 (CSR)	 in	 germinal	 cen-
ters	and	leads	to	profound	deficiency	in	production	of	IgG,	IgA,	and	
IgE	 (although	 IgM	 production	 is	 maintained).	 Approximately	 half	 of	
HIGM	sufferers	are	also	prone	to	opportunistic	infections,	for	exam-
ple,	interstitial	pneumonitis	caused	by	P. jiroveci	(in	young	children),	
protracted	 diarrhea	 and	 cholangitis	 caused	 by	 Cryptosporidium,	 and	
infection	of	the	brain	with	Toxoplasma gondii.

In	the	majority	of	cases,	this	condition	has	an	X-linked	inheritance	
and	is	caused	by	a	deficiency	in	CD40	ligand	(L).	CD40L	induces	sig-
naling	events	in	B	cells	that	are	necessary	for	both	CSR	and	adequate	
activation	 of	 other	 CD40-expressing	 cells	 that	 are	 involved	 in	 innate	
immune	 responses	 against	 the	 above-mentioned	 microorganisms.	
More	 rarely,	 the	 condition	 is	 caused	 by	 a	 deficiency	 in	 CD40	 itself.	
The	 poorer	 prognosis	 of	 CD40L	 and	 CD40	 deficiencies	 (relative	 to	
most	other	HIGM	conditions)	implies	that	(1)	thorough	investigations	
have	to	be	performed	in	all	cases	of	HIGM	and	(2)	potentially	curative	
HSCT	 should	 be	 discussed	 on	 a	 case-by-case	 basis	 for	 this	 group	 of	
patients.

Wiskott-Aldrich  Syndrome  WAS	 is	 a	 complex,	 recessive,	
X-linked	 disease	 with	 an	 incidence	 of	 ~1	 in	 200,000	 live	 births.	 It	 is	
caused	 by	 mutations	 in	 the	 WASP	 gene	 that	 affect	 not	 only	 T	 lym-
phocytes	 but	 also	 the	 other	 lymphocyte	 subsets,	 dendritic	 cells,	 and	
platelets.	 WAS	 is	 typically	 characterized	 by	 the	 following	 clinical	
manifestations:	 recurrent	 bacterial	 infections,	 eczema,	 and	 bleeding	
caused	by	thrombocytopenia.	However,	these	manifestations	are	highly	
variable—mostly	as	a	consequence	of	the	many	different	WASP	muta-
tions	that	have	been	observed.	Null	mutations	predispose	affected	indi-
viduals	to	invasive	and	bronchopulmonary	infections,	viral	infections,	
severe	 eczema,	 and	 autoimmune	 manifestations.	 The	 latter	 include	
autoantibody-mediated	blood	cytopenia,	glomerulonephritis,	skin	and	
visceral	vasculitis	(including	brain	vasculitis),	erythema	nodosum,	and	
arthritis.	Another	possible	consequence	of	WAS	is	lymphoma,	which	
may	 be	 virally	 induced	 (e.g.,	 by	 EBV	 or	 Kaposi’s	 sarcoma–associated	
herpesvirus).	 Thrombocytopenia	 can	 be	 severe	 and	 compounded	 by	
the	 peripheral	 destruction	 of	 platelets	 associated	 with	 autoimmune	
disorders.	 Hypomorphic	 mutations	 usually	 lead	 to	 milder	 outcomes	
that	are	generally	limited	to	thrombocytopenia.	It	is	noteworthy	that	
even	patients	with	“isolated”	X-linked	thrombocytopenia	can	develop	
severe	 autoimmune	 disease	 or	 lymphoma	 later	 in	 life.	 The	 immuno-
logic	 workup	 is	 not	 very	 informative;	 there	 can	 be	 a	 relative	 CD8+	
T-cell	 deficiency,	 frequently	 accompanied	 by	 low	 serum	 IgM	 levels	
and	 decreased	 antigen-specific	 antibody	 responses.	 A	 typical	 feature	
is	 reduced-sized	 platelets	 on	 a	 blood	 smear.	 Diagnosis	 is	 based	 on	
intracellular	 immunofluorescence	 analysis	 of	 WAS	 protein	 (WASp)	
expression	in	blood	cells.	WASp	regulates	the	actin	cytoskeleton	and	
thus	plays	an	important	role	in	many	lymphocyte	functions,	including	
cell	 adhesion	 and	 migration	 and	 the	 formation	 of	 synapses	 between	
antigen-presenting	and	target	cells.	Predisposition	to	autoimmune	dis-
orders	is	in	part	related	to	defective	regulatory	T	cells.	The	treatment	
of	WAS	should	match	the	severity	of	disease	expression.	Prophylactic	
antibiotics,	 immunoglobulin	 G	 (IgG)	 supplementation,	 and	 careful	
topical	 treatment	 of	 eczema	 are	 indicated.	 Although	 splenectomy	
improves	platelet	count	in	a	majority	of	cases,	this	intervention	is	asso-
ciated	with	a	significant	risk	of	infection	(both	before	and	after	HSCT).	
Allogeneic	HSCT	is	curative,	with	good	results	overall.	Gene	therapy	
trials	have	been	performed.	A	similar	condition	has	been	reported	in	a	
girl	with	a	deficiency	in	the	Wiskott-Aldrich	interacting	protein	(WIP).
A	few	other	complex	PIDs	are	worth	mentioning.	Sp110 deficiency	
causes	a	T-cell	PID	with	liver	venoocclusive	disease	and	hypogamma-
globulinemia.	Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis	(CMC)	is	a	hetero-
geneous	 disease,	 considering	 the	 different	 inheritance	 patterns	 that	
have	 been	 observed.	 In	 some	 cases,	 chronic	 candidiasis	 is	 associated	
with	 late-onset	 bronchopulmonary	 infections,	 bronchiectasis,	 and	
brain	 aneurysms.	 Moderate	 forms	 of	 CMC	 are	 related	 to	 autoimmu-
nity	 and	 AIRE	 deficiency	 (see	 below).	 In	 this	 setting,	 predisposition	
to	Candida	infection	is	associated	with	the	detection	of	autoantibodies	
to	TH17	cytokines.	Recently,	deficiencies	in	IL-17A,	IL-17F,	and	IL-17	
receptor	 A	 and	 C	 and	 in	 the	 associated	 protein	 Act1,	 and	 above	 all,	

gain-of-function	mutations	in	STAT1	have	been	found	to	be	associated	
with	 CMC.	 In	 all	 cases,	 CMC	 is	 related	 to	 defective	 TH17	 function.	
Innate	immunodeficiency	in	CARD9	also	predisposes	to	chronic	inva-
sive	fungal	infection.
 ■ B LYMPHOCYTE DEFICIENCIES  
(TABLE 351-1, FIG. 351-4)
Deficiencies	that	predominantly	affect	B	lymphocytes	are	the	most	fre-
quent	PIDs	and	account	for	60–70%	of	all	cases.	B	lymphocytes	make	
antibodies.	 Pentameric	 IgMs	 are	 found	 in	 the	 vascular	 compartment	
and	are	also	secreted	at	mucosal	surfaces.	IgG	antibodies	diffuse	freely	
into	 extravascular	 spaces,	 whereas	 IgA	 antibodies	 are	 produced	 and	
secreted	 predominantly	 from	 mucosa-associated	 lymphoid	 tissues.	
Although	 Ig	 isotypes	 have	 distinct	 effector	 functions,	 including	 Fc	
receptor–mediated	 and	 (indirectly)	 C3	 receptor–dependent	 phago-
cytosis	 of	 microorganisms,	 they	 share	 the	 ability	 to	 recognize	 and	
neutralize	a	given	pathogen.	Defective	antibody	production	therefore	
allows	 the	 establishment	 of	 invasive,	 pyogenic	 bacterial	 infections	 as	
well	as	recurrent	sinus	and	pulmonary	infections	(mostly	caused	by	S. 
pneumoniae,	 Haemophilus  influenzae,	 Moraxella  catarrhalis,	 and,	 less	
frequently,	 gram-negative	 bacteria).	 If	 left	 untreated,	 recurrent	 bron-
chial	infections	lead	to	bronchiectasis	and,	ultimately,	cor	pulmonale	
and	death.	Parasitic	infections	such	as	caused	by	Giardia lamblia	and	
bacterial	 infections	 caused	 by	 Helicobacter	 and	 Campylobacter	 of	 the	
gut	are	also	observed.	A	complete	lack	of	antibody	production	(namely	
agammaglobulinemia)	 can	 also	 predispose	 affected	 individuals	 to	
severe,	chronic,	disseminated	enteroviral	infections	causing	meningo-
encephalitis,	hepatitis,	and	a	dermatomyositis-like	disease.

Even	with	the	most	profound	of	B-cell	deficiencies,	infections	rarely	
occur	before	the	age	of	6	months;	this	is	because	of	transient	protection	
provided	by	the	transplacental	passage	of	immunoglobulins	during	the	
last	trimester	of	pregnancy.	Conversely,	a	genetically	nonimmunodefi-
cient	child	born	to	a	mother	with	hypogammaglobulinemia	is,	in	the	
absence	of	maternal	Ig	substitution,	usually	prone	to	severe	bacterial	
infections	in	utero	and	for	several	months	after	birth.

Diagnosis	 of	 B-cell	 PIDs	 relies	 on	 the	 determination	 of	 serum	 Ig	
levels	(Table	351-2).	Determination	of	antibody	production	following	
immunization	 with	 tetanus	 toxoid	 vaccine	 or	 nonconjugated	 pneu-
mococcal	polysaccharide	antigens	can	also	help	diagnose	more	subtle	
deficiencies.	 Another	 useful	 test	 is	 B-cell	 phenotype	 determination	
in	 switched	 μ−δ−	 CD27+	 and	 nonswitched	 memory	 B	 cells	 (μ+δ+	
CD27+).	In	agammaglobulinemic	patients,	examination	of	bone	mar-
row	B-cell	precursors	(Fig.	351-4)	can	help	obtain	a	precise	diagnosis	
and	guide	the	choice	of	genetic	tests.
Agammaglobulinemia  Agammaglobulinemia	is	characterized	by	
a	 profound	 defect	 in	 B-cell	 development	 (<1%	 of	 the	 normal	 B-cell	
blood	 count).	 In	 most	 patients,	 very	 low	 residual	 Ig	 isotypes	 can	 be	
detected	in	the	serum.	In	85%	of	cases,	agammaglobulinemia	is	caused	
by	a	mutation	in	the	BTK	gene	that	is	located	on	the	X	chromosome.	
The	 BTK	 gene	 product	 is	 a	 kinase	 that	 participates	 in	 (pre)	 B-cell	
receptor	signaling.	When	the	kinase	is	defective,	there	is	a	block	(albeit	
a	leaky	one)	at	the	pre-B	to	B-cell	stage	(Fig.	351-4).	Detection	of	BTK	
by	 intracellular	 immunofluorescence	 of	 monocytes,	 and	 lack	 thereof	
in	 patients	 with	 X-linked	 agammaglobulinemia	 (XLA),	 is	 a	 useful	
diagnostic	 test.	 Not	 all	 of	 the	 mutations	 in	 BTK	 result	 in	 agamma-
globulinemia,	since	some	patients	have	a	milder	form	of	hypogamma-
globulinemia	and	low	but	detectable	B-cell	counts.	These	cases	should	
not	 be	 confused	 with	 common	 variable	 immunodeficiency	 (CVID,	
see	 below).	 About	 10%	 of	 agammaglobulinemia	 cases	 are	 caused	 by	
alterations	in	genes	encoding	elements	of	the	pre-B-cell	receptor,	i.e.,	
the	μ	heavy	chain,	the	λ5	surrogate	light	chain,	Igα	or	Igβ,	the	scaffold	
protein	BLNK,	the	p85	α	subunit	of	phosphatidylinositol	3	phosphate	
kinase	(P13K),	the	E47,	and	the	Ikaros	transcription	factors.	In	5%	of	
cases,	the	defect	is	unknown.	It	is	noteworthy	that	agammaglobuline-
mia	can	be	observed	in	patients	with	ICF	syndrome,	despite	the	pres-
ence	of	normal	peripheral	B-cell	counts.	Lastly,	agammaglobulinemia	
can	be	a	manifestation	of	a	myelodysplastic	syndrome	(associated	or	
not	 with	 neutropenia).	 Treatment	 of	 agammaglobulinemic	 patients	
is	 based	 on	 immunoglobulin	 replacement	 (see	 below).	 Profound

hypogammaglobulinemia	 is	 also	 observed	 in	 adults,	 in	 association	
with	thymoma.
Hyper-IgM  (HIGM)  Syndromes  HIGM	 is	 a	 rare	 B-cell	 PID	
characterized	by	defective	Ig	CSR.	It	results	in	very	low	serum	levels	
of	 IgG	and	 IgA	and	 elevated	or	normal	serum	IgM	levels.	The	clini-
cal	 severity	 is	 similar	 to	 that	 seen	 in	 agammaglobulinemia,	 although	
chronic	 lung	 disease	 and	 sinusitis	 are	 less	 frequent	 and	 enteroviral	
infections	are	uncommon.	As	discussed	above,	a	diagnosis	of	HIGM	
involves	screening	for	an	X-linked	CD40L	deficiency	and	an	autoso-
mal	recessive	CD40	deficiency,	which	affect	both	B	and	T	cells.	In	50%	
of	cases	affecting	only	B	cells,	these	isolated	HIGM	syndromes	result	
from	 mutations	 in	 the	 gene	 encoding	 activation-induced	 deaminase,	
the	protein	that	induces	CSR	in	B-cell	germinal	centers.	These	patients	
usually	have	enlarged	lymphoid	organs.	In	the	other	50%	of	cases,	the	
etiology	 is	 unknown	 (except	 for	 rare	 UNG	 and	 PMS2	 deficiencies).	
Furthermore,	IgM-mediated	autoimmunity	and	lymphomas	can	occur	
in	HIGM	syndrome.	It	is	noteworthy	that	HIGM	can	result	from	fetal	
rubella	 syndrome	 or	 can	 be	 a	 predominant	 immunologic	 feature	 of	
other	PIDs,	such	as	the	immunodeficiency	associated	with	ectodermic	
anhydrotic	hypoplasia	X-linked	NEMO	deficiency	and	the	combined	
T-	and	B-cell	PIDs	caused	by	DNA	repair	defects	such	as	AT	and	Cer-
nunnos	deficiency.

Common Variable Immunodeficiency  CVID	 is	 an	 ill-defined	
condition	 characterized	 by	 low	 serum	 levels	 of	 one	 or	 more	 Ig	 iso-
types.	 Its	 prevalence	 is	 estimated	 to	 be	 1	 in	 20,000.	 The	 condition	 is	
recognized	 predominantly	 in	 adults,	 although	 clinical	 manifestations	
can	occur	earlier	in	life.	Hypogammaglobulinemia	is	associated	with	
at	 least	 partially	 defective	 antibody	 production	 in	 response	 to	 vac-
cine	antigens.	B	lymphocyte	counts	are	often	normal	but	can	be	low.	
Besides	 infections,	 CVID	 patients	 may	 develop	 lymphoproliferation	
(splenomegaly),	 granulomatous	 lesions,	 colitis,	 antibody-mediated	
autoimmune	disease,	and	lymphomas	that	define	disease	prognosis.	A	
family	history	is	found	in	10%	of	cases.	A	clear-cut	dominant	inheri-
tance	pattern	is	found	in	some	families,	whereas	recessive	inheritance	
is	 observed	 more	 rarely.	 In	 most	 cases,	 no	 molecular	 cause	 can	 be	
identified.	A	small	number	of	patients	in	Germany	were	found	to	carry	
mutations	in	the	ICOS	gene	encoding	a	T-cell	membrane	protein	that	
contributes	to	B-cell	activation	and	survival.	In	10%	of	patients	with	
CVID,	monoallelic	or	biallelic	mutations	of	the	gene	encoding	TACI	
(a	 member	 of	 the	 tumor	 necrosis	 factor	 [TNF]	 receptor	 family	 that	
is	expressed	on	B	cells)	have	been	found.	In	fact,	heterozygous	TACI	
mutations	 correspond	 to	 a	 genetic	 susceptibility	 factor,	 since	 similar	
heterozygous	mutations	are	found	in	1%	of	controls.	NFkB1	transcrip-
tion	factor	mutations	have	been	found	in	a	small	fraction	of	patients	
with	CVID.	The	B-cell	activating	factor	(BAFF)	receptor	was	found	to	
be	defective	in	a	kindred	with	CVID,	although	not	all	individuals	car-
rying	the	mutation	have	CVID.	A	group	of	patients	with	hypogamma-
globulinemia	and	lymphoproliferation	was	shown	to	exhibit	dominant	
gain-of-function	 mutations	 in	 the	 PIK3CD	 gene	 encoding	 the	 p110δ	
form	 of	 P13	 kinase	 or	 in	 the	 PI3KR1	 gene	 encoding	 the	 regulatory	
p85α	 subunit	 of	 PI3	 kinase.	 Rare	 cases	 of	 hypogammaglobulinemia	
were	found	to	be	associated	with	CD19,	CD20,	CD21,	and	CD81	defi-
ciencies.	These	patients	have	B	cells	that	can	be	identified	by	typing	for	
other	B-cell	markers.

A	diagnosis	of	CVID	should	be	made	after	excluding	the	presence	
of	 hypomorphic	 mutations	 associated	 with	 agammaglobulinemia	 or	
more	subtle	T-cell	defects;	this	is	particularly	the	case	in	children.	It	is	
possible	that	many	cases	of	CVID	result	from	a	constellation	of	factors,	
rather	 than	 a	 single	 genetic	 defect.	 Hypogammaglobulinemia	 can	 be	
associated	with	neutropenia	and	lymphopenia	in	the	WHIM	syndrome	
caused	by	a	dominant	gain-of-function	mutation	of	CXCR4,	resulting	
in	cell	retention	in	the	bone	marrow.

Selective  Ig  Isotype  Deficiencies 
IgA  deficiency	 and	 CVID	
represent	polar	ends	of	a	clinical	spectrum	due	to	the	same	underly-
ing	gene	defect(s)	in	a	large	subset	of	these	patients.	IgA	deficiency	is	
the	most	common	PID;	it	can	be	found	in	1	in	every	600	individuals.	
It	 is	 asymptomatic	 in	 most	 cases;	 however,	 individuals	 may	 present	

with	 increased	 numbers	 of	 acute	 and	 chronic	 respiratory	 infections	
that	may	lead	to	bronchiectasis.	In	addition,	over	their	lifetime,	these	
patients	experience	an	increased	susceptibility	to	drug	allergies,	atopic	
disorders,	 and	 autoimmune	 diseases.	 Symptomatic	 IgA	 deficiency	 is	
probably	related	to	CVID,	since	it	can	be	found	in	relatives	of	patients	
with	CVID.	Furthermore,	IgA	deficiency	may	progress	to	CVID.	It	is	
thus	important	to	assess	serum	Ig	levels	in	IgA-deficient	patients	(espe-
cially	 when	 infections	 occur	 frequently)	 in	 order	 to	 detect	 changes	
that	 should	 prompt	 the	 initiation	 of	 immunoglobulin	 replacement.	
Selective	IgG2	(+G4)	deficiency	(which	in	some	cases	may	be	associ-
ated	with	IgA	deficiency)	can	also	result	in	recurrent	sinopulmonary	
infections	and	should	thus	be	specifically	sought	in	this	clinical	setting.	
These	conditions	are	ill-defined	and	often	transient	during	childhood.	
A	pathophysiologic	explanation	has	not	been	found.

Selective  Antibody  Deficiency  to  Polysaccharide  Antigens 	
Some	patients	with	normal	serum	Ig	levels	are	prone	to	S. pneumoniae	
and	H. influenzae	infections	of	the	respiratory	tract.	Defective	produc-
tion	of	antibodies	against	polysaccharide	antigens	(such	as	those	in	the	
S.  pneumoniae	 cell	 wall)	 can	 be	 observed	 and	 is	 probably	 causative.	
This	condition	may	correspond	to	a	defect	in	marginal	zone	B	cells,	a	
B-cell	subpopulation	involved	in	T-independent	antibody	responses.

Immunoglobulin  Replacement 
IgG	 antibodies	 have	 a	 half-life	
of	21–28	days.	Thus,	injection	of	plasma-derived	polyclonal	IgG	con-
taining	 a	 myriad	 of	 high-affinity	 antibodies	 can	 provide	 protection	
against	disease-causing	microorganisms	in	patients	with	defective	IgG	
antibody	 production.	 This	 form	 of	 therapy	 should	 not	 be	 based	 on	
laboratory	data	alone	(i.e.,	IgG	and/or	antibody	deficiency)	but	should	
be	guided	by	the	occurrence	or	not	of	infections;	otherwise,	patients	
might	 be	 subjected	 to	 unjustified	 IgG	 infusions.	 Immunoglobulin	
replacement	 can	 be	 performed	 by	 IV	 or	 subcutaneous	 routes.	 In	 the	
former	 case,	 injections	 have	 to	 be	 repeated	 every	 3–4	 weeks,	 with	 a	
residual	 target	 level	 above	 800	 mg/mL	 in	 patients	 who	 had	 very	 low	
IgG	levels	prior	to	therapy.	Subcutaneous	injections	are	typically	per-
formed	once	a	week,	although	the	frequency	can	be	adjusted	on	a	case-
by-case	basis.	A	trough	level	above	800	mg/mL	is	desirable.	Whatever	
the	mode	of	administration,	the	main	goal	is	to	reduce	the	frequency	
of	the	respiratory	tract	infections	and	prevent	chronic	lung	and	sinus	
disease.	The	two	routes	appear	to	be	equally	safe	and	efficacious,	and	so	
the	choice	should	be	left	to	the	preference	of	the	patient.

In	 patients	 with	 chronic	 lung	 disease,	 chest	 physical	 therapy	 with	
good	pulmonary	toilet	and	the	use	of	antibiotics,	notably	azithromycin,	
are	also	needed.	Immunoglobulin	replacement	is	well	tolerated	by	most	
patients,	 although	 the	 selection	 of	 the	 best-tolerated	 Ig	 preparation	
may	 be	 necessary	 in	 certain	 cases.	 Since	 IgG	 preparations	 contain	 a	
small	 proportion	 of	 IgAs,	 caution	 should	 be	 taken	 in	 patients	 with	
residual	antibody	production	capacity	and	a	complete	IgA	deficiency,	
as	 these	 subjects	 may	 develop	 anti-IgA	 antibodies	 that	 can	 trigger	
anaphylactic	shock.	These	patients	should	be	treated	with	IgA-free	IgG	
preparations.	 Immunoglobulin	 replacement	 is	 a	 lifelong	 therapy;	 its	
rationale	and	procedures	have	to	be	fully	understood	and	mastered	by	
the	patient	and	his	or	her	family	in	order	to	guarantee	the	strict	obser-
vance	required	for	efficacy.

PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES 
AFFECTING REGULATORY PATHWAYS 
(TABLE 351-1)
An	increasing	number	of	PIDs	have	been	found	to	cause	homeostatic	
dysregulation	of	the	immune	system,	either	alone	or	in	association	with	
increased	vulnerability	to	infections.	Defects	of	this	type	affecting	the	
innate	immune	system	and	autoinflammatory	syndromes	will	not	be	
covered	in	this	chapter.	However,	three	specific	entities	(hemophago-
cytic	 lymphohistiocytosis	 [HLH],	 lymphoproliferation,	 and	 autoim-
munity)	will	be	described	below.

 ■ HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS
HLH	 is	 characterized	 by	 an	 unremitting	 activation	 of	 CD8+	 T	 lym-
phocytes	and	macrophages	that	leads	to	organ	damage	(notably	in	the

2718 liver,	bone	marrow,	and	central	nervous	system).	This	syndrome	results	
from	a	broad	set	of	inherited	diseases,	most	of	which	impair	T	and	NK	
lymphocyte	cytotoxicity.	The	manifestations	of	HLH	are	often	induced	
by	a	viral	infection.	EBV	is	the	most	frequent	trigger.	In	severe	forms	
of	HLH,	disease	onset	may	start	during	the	first	year	of	life	or	even	(in	
rare	cases)	at	birth.

Diagnosis	relies	on	the	identification	of	the	characteristic	symptoms	
of	HLH	(fever,	hepatosplenomegaly,	edema,	neurologic	diseases,	blood	
cytopenia,	increased	liver	enzymes,	hypofibrinogenemia,	high	triglyc-
eride	[hyper	ferritinemia]	levels,	elevated	markers	of	T-cell	activation,	
and	 hemophagocytic	 features	 in	 the	 bone	 marrow	 or	 cerebrospinal	
fluid).	 Functional	 assays	 of	 postactivation	 cytotoxic	 granule	 exocy-
tosis	 (CD107	 fluorescence	 at	 the	 cell	 membrane)	 can	 suggest	 genet-
ically	 determined	 HLH.	 The	 conditions	 can	 be	 classified	 into	 three		
subsets:

1.	 Familial	HLH	with	autosomal	recessive	inheritance,	including	per-
forin	deficiency	(30%	of	cases)	that	can	be	recognized	by	assessing	
intracellular	 perforin	 expression;	 Munc13-4	 deficiency	 (30%	 of	
cases);	syntaxin	11	deficiency	(10%	of	cases);	Munc18-2	deficiency	
(20%	of	cases);	and	a	few	residual	cases	that	lack	a	known	molecular	
defect.

2.	 HLH	 with	 partial	 albinism.	 Three	 conditions	 combine	 HLH	 and	
abnormal	 pigmentation,	 where	 hair	 examination	 can	 help	 in	 the	
diagnosis:	 Chédiak-Higashi	 syndrome,	 Griscelli	 syndrome,	 and	
Hermansky-Pudlak	syndrome	type	II.	Chédiak-Higashi	syndrome	is	
also	characterized	by	the	presence	of	giant	lysosomes	within	leuko-
cytes	(Chap. 64),	in	addition	to	a	primary	neurologic	disorder	with	
slow	progression	of	symptoms	over	time.

3.	 XLP	 is	 characterized	 in	 most	 patients	 by	 the	 induction	 of	 HLH	
following	 EBV	 infection,	 while	 other	 patients	 develop	 progressive	
hypogammaglobulinemia	similar	to	what	is	observed	in	CVID	and/
or	certain	lymphomas.	XLP	is	caused	by	a	mutation	in	the	SH2DIA	
gene	 that	 encodes	 the	 adaptor	 protein	 SAP	 (associated	 with	 a	
SLAM	 family	 receptor).	 Several	 immunologic	 abnormalities	 have	
been	 described,	 including	 low	 2B4-mediated	 NK	 cell	 cytotoxicity,	
impaired	 differentiation	 of	 NKT	 cells,	 defective	 antigen-induced	
T-cell	death,	and	defective	T-cell	helper	activity	for	B	cells.	A	related	
disorder	(XLP2)	has	recently	been	described.	It	is	also	X-linked	and	
induces	HLH	(frequently	after	EBV	infection),	although	the	clinical	
manifestation	may	be	less	pronounced.	The	condition	is	associated	
with	 a	 deficiency	 of	 the	 antiapoptotic	 molecule	 XIAP.	 The	 patho-
physiology	 of	 XLP2	 remains	 unclear;	 however,	 it	 may	 be	 related	
to	control	of	inflammation	in	macrophages	as	there	is	a	functional	
link	between	XIAP	and	NLRC4,	an	inflammasome	component,	in	
which	gain	of	function	can	also	induce	HLH.	XLP2	is	also	frequently	
associated	with	colitis.

HLH	is	a	life-threatening	complication.	The	treatment	of	this	condi-
tion	requires	aggressive	immunosuppression	with	either	the	cytotoxic	
agent	 etoposide	 or	 anti–T-cell	 antibodies;	 specific	 therapy	 targeting	
IFN-γ,	which	is	critical	in	causing	HLH,	is	an	additional	option	to	con-
sider.	Once	remission	has	been	achieved,	HSCT	should	be	performed,	
since	it	provides	the	only	curative	form	of	therapy.	Of	note,	acquired	
forms	of	HLH	are	more	commonly	observed	in	adults	as	a	complica-
tion	of	infection,	malignancies	or	autoimmune	diseases	or	sometimes	
on	its	own.

 ■ AUTOIMMUNE LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE 
SYNDROME
Autoimmune  lymphoproliferative  syndrome	 (ALPS)	 is	 characterized	
by	nonmalignant	T	and	B	lymphoproliferation	causing	splenomegaly	
and	enlarged	lymph	nodes;	70%	of	patients	also	display	autoimmune	
manifestations	 such	 as	 autoimmune	 cytopenias,	 Guillain-Barré	 syn-
drome,	 uveitis,	 and	 hepatitis	 (Chaps.  66  and  349).	 A	 hallmark	 of	
ALPS	is	the	presence	of	CD4–CD8–	TCRαβ+	T	cells	(2–50%)	in	the	
blood	 of	 affected	 individuals.	 Hypergammaglobulinemia	 involving	
IgG	and	IgA	is	also	frequently	observed.	The	syndrome	is	caused	by	

a	 defect	 in	 Fas-mediated	 apoptosis	 of	 lymphocytes,	 which	 can	 thus	
accumulate	and	mediate	autoimmunity.	Furthermore,	ALPS	can	lead	
to	malignancies.

Most	patients	carry	a	heterozygous	mutation	in	the	gene	encoding	
Fas	 that	 is	 characterized	 by	 dominant	 inheritance	 and	 variable	 pen-
etrance,	depending	on	the	nature	of	the	mutation.	A	rare	and	severe	
form	of	the	disease	with	early	onset	can	be	observed	in	patients	carry-
ing	a	biallelic	mutation	of	Fas,	which	profoundly	impairs	the	protein’s	
expression	 and/or	 function.	 Fas-ligand,	 caspase	 10,	 caspase	 8,	 and	
somatic	 neuroblastoma	 RAS	 viral	 oncogene	 homologue	 (NRAS)	 and	
KRAS	mutations	have	also	been	reported	in	a	few	cases	of	ALPS.	Many	
cases	of	ALPS	have	not	been	precisely	delineated	at	the	molecular	level.	
A	B	cell–predominant	ALPS	has	recently	been	found	associated	with	
a	 protein	 kinase	 Cδ	 gene	 mutation.	 Treatment	 of	 ALPS	 is	 essentially	
based	 on	 the	 use	 of	 proapoptotic	 drugs,	 which	 need	 to	 be	 carefully	
administered	in	order	to	avoid	toxicity.

 ■ COLITIS, AUTOIMMUNITY, AND PRIMARY 
IMMUNODEFICIENCIES
Several	PIDs	(most	of	which	are	T	cell–related)	can	cause	severe	gut	
inflammation.	The	prototypic	example	is	immunodysregulation polyen-
docrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome	(IPEX),	characterized	by	
a	widespread	inflammatory	enteropathy,	food	intolerance,	skin	rashes,	
autoimmune	 cytopenias,	 and	 diabetes.	 The	 syndrome	 is	 caused	 by	
loss-of-function	mutations	in	the	gene	encoding	the	transcription	fac-
tor	FOXP3,	which	is	required	for	the	acquisition	of	effector	function	
by	regulatory	T	cells.	In	most	cases	of	IPEX,	CD4+CD25+	regulatory	
T	cells	are	absent	from	the	blood.	This	condition	has	a	poor	prognosis	
and	requires	aggressive	immunosuppression.	The	only	possible	cura-
tive	 approach	 is	 allogeneic	 HSCT.	 IPEX-like	 syndromes	 that	 lack	 a	
FOXP3	mutation	have	also	been	described.	In	some	cases,	CD25	(IL-2	
receptor	α	subunit)	and	CD122	(IL-2	receptor	β	subunit)	deficiencies	
have	 been	 found.	 Defective	 IL-2	 receptor	 expression	 also	 impairs	
regulatory	 cell	 expansion/function.	 This	 functional	 T-cell	 deficiency	
means	that	IL-2	receptor–deficient	patients	are	also	at	increased	risk	
of	 opportunistic	 infections.	 It	 is	 noteworthy	 that	 abnormalities	 in	
regulatory	T	cells	have	been	described	in	other	PID	settings,	such	as	
in	Omenn	syndrome,	STAT5b	deficiency,	STIM1	(Ca	flux)	deficiency,	
and	 WAS;	 these	 abnormalities	 may	 account	 (at	 least	 in	 part)	 for	 the	
occurrence	 of	 inflammation	 and	 autoimmunity.	 The	 autoimmune	
features	observed	in	a	small	fraction	of	patients	with	DiGeorge’s	syn-
drome	may	have	the	same	cause.	Severe,	early-onset	inflammatory	gut	
disease	has	been	described	in	patients	with	a	deficiency	in	the	IL-10	
receptor	or	IL-10.

Dominant	 mutations	 in	 genes	 encoding	 the	 regulatory	 molecule	
CTLA-4,	recessive	mutations	in	the	gene	encoding	LRBA	(a	molecule	
involved	in	recycling	of	CTLA-4),	as	well	as	dominant	gain-of-function	
mutation	 of	 STAT3	 cause	 a	 multifaceted	 lymphoproliferative	 and	
autoimmune	 syndrome,	 frequently	 involving	 inflammatory	 bowel	
disease	that	can	be	associated	with	hypogammaglobulinemia.	Molec-
ular	 diagnosis	 is	 required	 before	 adapted	 targeted	 therapies	 are	
undertaken.

A	 distinct	 autoimmune	 entity	 is	 observed	 in	 autoimmune  polyen-
docrinopathy  candidiasis  ectodermal  dysplasia	 (APECED)	 syndrome,	
which	is	characterized	by	autosomal	recessive	inheritance.	It	consists	
of	 multiple	 autoimmune	 manifestations	 that	 can	 affect	 solid	 organs	
in	general	and	endocrine	glands	in	particular.	Mild,	chronic	Candida	
infection	is	often	associated	with	this	syndrome.	The	condition	is	due	
to	mutations	in	the	autoimmune	regulator	(AIRE)	gene	and	results	in	
impaired	 thymic	 expression	 of	 self-antigens	 by	 medullary	 epithelial	
cells	and	impaired	negative	selection	of	self-reactive	T	cells	that	leads	
to	autoimmune	manifestations.

A	 combination	 of	 hypogammaglobulinemia,	 autoantibody	
production,	 cold-induced	 urticaria	 or	 skin	 granulomas,	 or	 auto-
inflammation	 has	 been	 reported	 and	 has	 been	 termed	 PLCγ2- 
associated  antibody  deficiency  and  immune  dysregulation	 (PLAID	 or		
APLAID).

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic DisordersCONCLUSION
The	variety	and	complexity	of	the	clinical	manifestations	of	the	many	
different	PIDs	strongly	indicate	that	it	is	important	to	raise	awareness	
of	these	diseases.	Indeed,	early	diagnosis	is	essential	for	establishing	an	
appropriate	therapeutic	regimen.	Hence,	patients	with	suspected	PIDs	
must	 always	 be	 referred	 to	 experienced	 clinical	 centers	 that	 are	 able	
to	perform	appropriate	molecular	and	genetic	tests.	A	precise	molec-
ular	 diagnosis	 is	 not	 only	 necessary	 for	 initiating	 the	 most	 suitable	
treatment,	 but	 is	 also	 important	 for	 genetic	 counseling	 and	 prenatal	
diagnosis.

One	 pitfall	 that	 may	 hamper	 diagnosis	 is	 the	 high	 variability	 that	
is	 associated	 with	 many	 PIDs.	 Variable	 disease	 expression	 can	 result	
from	the	differing	consequences	of	various	mutations	associated	with	
a	given	condition,	as	exemplified	by	WAS	and,	to	a	lesser	extent,	XLA.	
There	can	also	be	effects	of	modifier	genes	(as	also	suspected	in	XLA)	
and	environmental	factors	such	as	EBV	infection	that	can	be	the	main	
trigger	of	disease	in	XLP	conditions.	Furthermore,	it	has	recently	been	
established	 that	 somatic	 mutations	 in	 an	 affected	 gene	 can	 attenuate	
the	phenotype	of	a	number	of	T-cell	PIDs.	This	has	been	described	for	
ADA	 deficiency,	 X-linked	 SCID,	 RAG	 deficiencies,	 NF-κB	 essential	
modulator	 (NEMO)	 deficiency,	 and,	 most	 frequently,	 WAS.	 In	 con-
trast,	somatic	mutations	can	create	disease	states	analogous	to	PID,	as	
reported	 for	 ALPS.	 Lastly,	 cytokine-neutralizing	 autoantibodies	 can	
mimic	a	PID,	as	shown	for	IFN-γ.

Many	aspects	of	the	pathophysiology	of	PIDs	are	still	unknown,	and	
the	disease-causing	gene	mutations	have	not	been	identified	in	all	cases	
(as	 illustrated	 by	 CVID	 and	 IgA	 deficiency).	 However,	 our	 medical	
understanding	of	PIDs	has	now	reached	the	stage	where	scientifically	
based	approaches	to	the	diagnosis	and	treatment	of	these	diseases	can	
be	implemented.	A	genetic	diagnosis	has	become	a	milestone	step	in	
the	care	of	PID	patients.

Section 2  Disorders of Immune-Mediated Injury

352 Urticaria, Angioedema, 
and Allergic Rhinitis
Katherine L. Tuttle, Joshua A. Boyce

 ■ INTRODUCTION
The	term	atopy	implies	a	tendency	to	manifest	asthma,	rhinitis,	urti-
caria,	food	allergy,	and	atopic	dermatitis	alone	or	in	combination,	in	
association	with	the	presence	of	allergen-specific	IgE.	However,	indi-
viduals	without	an	atopic	background	may	also	develop	hypersensitiv-
ity	reactions,	particularly	urticaria	and	anaphylaxis,	associated	with	the	
presence	of	IgE.	Since	mast	cells	are	key	effector	cells	in	allergic	rhinitis	
and	asthma,	and	the	dominant	effector	in	urticaria,	anaphylaxis,	and	
systemic	 mastocytosis,	 mast	 cell	 developmental	 biology,	 activation	
pathway,	product	profile,	and	target	tissues	will	be	considered	in	the	
introduction	 to	 these	 clinical	 disorders.	 Dysregulation	 of	 mast	 cell	
development	seen	in	mastocytosis	will	be	covered	in	a	separate	chapter.
The	 binding	 of	 IgE	 to	 human	 mast	 cells	 and	 basophils,	 a	 process	
termed	 sensitization,	 prepares	 these	 cells	 for	 subsequent	 antigen-	
specific	 activation.	 The	 high-affinity	 Fc	 receptor	 for	 IgE,	 designated	
FcεRI,	is	composed	of	one	α,	one	β,	and	two	disulfide-linked	γ	chains,	
which	together	cross	the	plasma	membrane	seven	times.	The	α	chain	is	
responsible	for	IgE	binding,	and	the	β	and	γ	chains	provide	for	signal	
transduction	that	follows	the	aggregation	of	the	sensitized	tetrameric	
receptors	by	polymeric	antigen.	The	binding	of	IgE	stabilizes	the	α	chain	
at	the	plasma	membrane,	thus	increasing	the	density	of	FcεRI	receptors	
at	the	cell	surface	while	sensitizing	the	cell	for	effector	responses.	This	
accounts	for	the	correlation	between	serum	IgE	levels	and	the	numbers	
of	FcεRI	receptors	detected	on	circulating	basophils.	Signal	transduc-
tion	 is	 initiated	 through	 the	 action	 of	 a	 Src	 family–related	 tyrosine	
kinase	termed	Lyn	that	is	constitutively	associated	with	the	β	chain.	Lyn	
transphosphorylates	 the	 canonical	 immunoreceptor	 tyrosine-based	
activation	motifs	(ITAMs)	of	the	β	and	γ	chains	of	the	receptor,	result-
ing	in	recruitment	of	more	active	Lyn	to	the	β	chain	and	of	Syk	tyrosine	
kinase.	The	phosphorylated	tyrosines	in	the	ITAMs	function	as	binding	
sites	for	the	tandem	src	homology	two	(SH2)	domains	within	Syk.	Syk	
activates	not	only	phospholipase	Cγ,	which	associates	with	the	linker	of	
activated	T	cells	at	the	plasma	membrane,	but	also	phosphatidylinositol	
3-kinase	 to	 provide	 phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate,	 which	
allows	membrane	targeting	of	the	Tec	family	kinase	Btk	and	its	activa-
tion	by	Lyn.	In	addition,	the	Src	family	tyrosine	kinase	Fyn	becomes	
activated	 after	 aggregation	 of	 IgE	 receptors	 and	 phosphorylates	 the	
adapter	protein	Gab2	that	enhances	activation	of	phosphatidylinositol	
3-kinase.	Indeed,	this	additional	input	is	essential	for	mast	cell	activa-
tion,	but	it	can	be	partially	inhibited	by	Lyn,	indicating	that	the	extent	
of	mast	cell	activation	is	in	part	regulated	by	the	interplay	between	these	
Src	 family	 kinases.	 Activated	 phospholipase	 Cγ	 cleaves	 phospholipid	
membrane	substrates	to	provide	inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate	(IP3)	and	
1,2-diacylglycerols	 (1,2-DAGs)	 to	 mobilize	 intracellular	 calcium	 and	
activate	 protein	 kinase	 C,	 respectively.	 The	 subsequent	 opening	 of		
calcium-regulated	activated	channels	provides	the	sustained	elevations	
of	 intracellular	 calcium	 required	 to	 recruit	 the	 mitogen-activated	
protein	kinases	ERK,	JNK,	and	p38	(serine/threonine	kinases),	which	
provide	cascades	to	augment	arachidonic	acid	release	and	to	mediate	
nuclear	 translocation	 of	 transcription	 factors	 for	 various	 cytokines.	
The	calcium	ion–dependent	activation	of	phospholipases	cleaves	mem-
brane	 phospholipids	 to	 generate	 lysophospholipids,	 which,	 like	 1,2-
DAG,	 may	 facilitate	 the	 fusion	 of	 the	 secretory	 granule	 perigranular	
membrane	with	the	cell	membrane,	a	step	that	releases	the	membrane-
free	granules	containing	the	preformed	mast	cell	mediators.

The	 secretory	 granule	 of	 the	 human	 mast	 cell	 has	 a	 crystalline	
structure.	 IgE-dependent	 cell	 activation	 results	 in	 solubilization	 and

FIGURE 352-1  Pathways for biosynthesis and release of membrane-derived lipid 
mediators from mast cells. In the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, leukotriene A4 (LTA4) is 
the intermediate from which the terminal-pathway enzymes generate the distinct 
final products, leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which leave the cell 
by  separate  saturable  transport  systems.  Gamma  glutamyl  transpeptidase  and  a 
dipeptidase then cleave glutamic acid and glycine from LTC4 to form LTD4 and LTE4, 
respectively. The major mast cell product of the cyclooxygenase system is PGD2.

swelling	 of	 the	 granule	 contents	 within	 the	 first	 minute	 of	 receptor	
perturbation;	this	reaction	is	followed	by	the	ordering	of	intermediate	
filaments	about	the	swollen	granule,	movement	of	the	granule	toward	
the	cell	surface,	and	fusion	of	the	perigranular	membrane	with	that	of	
other	granules	and	with	the	plasmalemma	to	form	extracellular	chan-
nels	for	mediator	release	while	maintaining	cell	viability.

In	 addition	 to	 exocytosis,	 aggregation	 of	 FcεRI	 initiates	 two	 addi-
tional	 pathways	 for	 generation	 of	 bioactive	 products,	 namely,	 lipid	
mediators,	chemokines,	and	cytokines.	Cytokines	elaborated	by	mast	
cells	include	tumor	necrosis	factor	α	(TNF-α),	interleukin	(IL)	1,	IL-6,	
IL-4,	 IL-5,	 IL-13,	 and	 granulocyte-macrophage	 colony-stimulating	
factor	(GM-CSF).

Lipid	mediator	generation	(Fig. 352-1)	involves	translocation	of	calcium	
ion–dependent	cytosolic	phospholipase	A2	to	the	outer	nuclear	membrane,	
with	subsequent	release	of	arachidonic	acid	for	metabolic	processing	by	
the	distinct	prostanoid	and	leukotriene	pathways.	The	constitutive	pros-
taglandin	endoperoxide	synthase-1	(PGHS-1/cyclooxygenase-1)	 and	 the	
de	novo	inducible	PGHS-2	(cyclooxygenase-2)	convert	released	arachi-
donic	acid	to	the	sequential	intermediates,	prostaglandins	G2	and	H2.	
The	 glutathione-dependent	 hematopoietic	 prostaglandin	 D2	 (PGD2)	
synthase	 then	 converts	 PGH2	 to	 PGD2,	 the	 predominant	 mast	 cell	
prostanoid.	 The	 PGD2	 receptor	 DP1	 is	 expressed	 by	 platelets,	 natural	
killer	cells,	dendritic	cells,	and	epithelial	cells,	whereas	DP2	is	expressed	
by	 TH2	 lymphocytes,	 innate	 lymphoid	 type	 2	 cells,	 eosinophils,	 and	
basophils.	 Mast	 cells	 also	 generate	 thromboxane	 A2	 (TXA2),	 a	 short	
lived	 but	 powerful	 mediator	 that	 induces	 bronchoconstriction	 and	
platelet	activation	through	the	T	prostanoid	(TP)	receptor.

For	 leukotriene	 biosynthesis,	 the	 released	 arachidonic	 acid	 is	
metabolized	 by	 5-lipoxygenase	 (5-LO)	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 an	 integral	
nuclear	 membrane	 protein,	 5-LO	 activating	 protein	 (FLAP).	 The	
calcium	 ion–dependent	 translocation	 of	 5-LO	 to	 the	 nuclear	 mem-
brane	 converts	 the	 arachidonic	 acid	 to	 the	 sequential	 intermediates,		
5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic	 acid	 (5-HPETE)	 and	 leukotriene	 (LT)	
A4.	LTA4	is	conjugated	with	reduced	glutathione	by	LTC4	synthase,	an	
integral	 nuclear	 membrane	 protein	 homologous	 to	 FLAP.	 Intracellu-
lar	 LTC4	 is	 released	 by	 a	 carrier-specific	 export	 step	 for	 extracellular	

metabolism	 to	 the	 additional	 cysteinyl	 leukotrienes,	 LTD4	 and	 LTE4,	
by	the	sequential	removal	of	glutamic	acid	and	glycine.	Alternatively,	
cytosolic	 LTA4	 hydrolase	 converts	 some	 LTA4	 to	 the	 dihydroxy	 leu-
kotriene	 LTB4,	 which	 also	 undergoes	 specific	 export.	 Two	 receptors	
for	LTB4,	BLT1	and	BLT2,	mediate	chemotaxis	of	human	neutrophils.	
Two	 receptors	 for	 the	 cysteinyl	 leukotrienes,	 CysLT1	 and	 CysLT2,	 are	
present	 on	 smooth	 muscle	 of	 the	 airways	 and	 the	 microvasculature	
and	on	hematopoietic	cells	such	as	macrophages,	eosinophils,	and	mast	
cells.	 Whereas	 the	 CysLT1	 receptor	 has	 a	 preference	 for	 LTD4	 and	 is	
blocked	by	the	receptor	antagonists	in	clinical	use,	the	CysLT2	receptor	
is	equally	responsive	to	LTD4	and	LTC4,	is	unaffected	by	these	antago-
nists,	and	is	a	negative	regulator	of	the	function	of	the	CysLT1	receptor.	
LTD4,	 acting	 at	 CysLT1	 receptors,	 is	 the	 most	 potent	 known	 bron-
choconstrictor,	whereas	LTE4	induces	a	vascular	leak	and	mediates	the	
recruitment	of	eosinophils	to	the	bronchial	mucosa.	Recently,	GPR99,	
initially	 identified	 as	 a	 receptor	 for	 α-ketoglutarate,	 was	 identified	 as	
an	LTE4	receptor.	The	lysophospholipid	formed	during	the	release	of	
arachidonic	acid	from	1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcho-
line	can	be	acetylated	in	the	second	position	to	form	platelet-activating	
factor	(PAF).	Serum	levels	of	PAF	correlated	positively	with	the	severity	
of	anaphylaxis	to	peanut	in	a	recent	study,	whereas	the	levels	of	PAF	
acetyl	 hydrolase	 (a	 PAF-degrading	 enzyme)	 were	 inversely	 related	 to	
the	same	outcome.

Human	mast	cells	express	receptors	for	anaphylatoxin,	C5a	and	C3a,	
toll-like	 receptors,	 receptors	 for	 epithelial	 alarmins	 thymic	 stromal	
lymphopoietin	(TSLP)	and	IL-33,	and	a	newly	recognized	Mas-related	
G	protein–coupled	receptor	(MRGPX2),	all	which	activate	mast	cells	
in	 an	 IgE-dependent	 manner.	 MRGPX2	 is	 a	 target	 of	 many	 small-	
molecule	 drugs	 with	 a	 central	 tetrahydroisoquinoline	 motif,	 such	
as	 ciprofloxacin	 and	 rocuronium,	 which	 may	 explain	 the	 observed	
episodes	of	anaphylaxis	to	these	medications	without	evidence	of	IgE-
mediated	hypersensitivity.

Unlike	 most	 other	 cells	 of	 bone	 marrow	 origin,	 mast	 cells	 circu-
late	 as	 committed	 progenitors	 lacking	 their	 characteristic	 secretory	
granules.	These	committed	progenitors	express	c-kit,	the	receptor	for	
stem	 cell	 factor	 (SCF).	 Unlike	 most	 other	 lineages,	 they	 retain	 and	
increase	 c-kit	 expression	 with	 maturation.	 The	 SCF	 interaction	 with	
c-kit	 is	 an	 absolute	 requirement	 for	 the	 development	 of	 both	 consti-
tutive	connective	tissue	and	skin	mast	cells	and	for	the	accumulation	
of	mast	cells	at	mucosal	surfaces	during	TH2-type	immune	responses.	
Several	T	cell–derived	cytokines	(IL-3,	IL-4,	IL-5,	and	IL-9)	can	poten-
tiate	 SCF-dependent	 mast	 cell	 proliferation	 and/or	 survival	 in	 vitro	
in	mice	and	humans.	Indeed,	mast	cells	are	absent	from	the	intestinal	
mucosa	in	clinical	T-cell	deficiencies	but	are	present	in	the	submucosa.	
Historical	 mast	 cell	 classification	 has	 been	 based	 on	 the	 immunode-
tection	 of	 secretory	 granule	 neutral	 proteases.	 Mast	 cells	 in	 the	 lung	
parenchyma	 and	 intestinal	 mucosa	 selectively	 express	 tryptase,	 and	
those	 in	 the	 intestinal	 and	 airway	 submucosa,	 perivascular	 spaces,	
skin,	lymph	nodes,	and	breast	parenchyma	express	tryptase,	chymase,	
and	 carboxypeptidase	 A	 (CPA).	 Selective	 environmental	 cues,	 such	
as	TH2	inflammation,	can	lead	to	different	protease	expression;	in	the	
mucosal	epithelium	of	severe	asthmatics	and	apical	epithelium	of	nasal	
polyps,	mast	cells	can	express	tryptase	and	CPA	without	chymase.	The	
secretory	granules	of	mast	cells	selectively	positive	for	tryptase	exhibit	
closed	scrolls	with	a	periodicity	suggestive	of	a	crystalline	structure	by	
electron	microscopy,	whereas	the	secretory	granules	of	mast	cells	with	
multiple	 proteases	 are	 scroll-poor,	 with	 an	 amorphous	 or	 lattice-like	
appearance.	In	addition	to	immunodetection	of	proteases,	expression	
profiling	 through	 single-cell	 RNA	 sequencing	 methods	 has	 further	
elucidated	different	mast	cell	populations.

Mast	 cells	 are	 distributed	 at	 cutaneous	 and	 mucosal	 surfaces	 and	
in	 submucosal	 tissues	 about	 venules	 and	 could	 influence	 the	 entry	
of	 foreign	 substances	 by	 their	 rapid	 response	 capability	 (Fig. 352-2).	
Upon	 stimulus-specific	 activation	 and	 secretory	 granule	 exocytosis,	
histamine	 and	 acid	 hydrolases	 are	 solubilized,	 whereas	 the	 neutral	
proteases,	which	are	cationic,	remain	largely	bound	to	the	anionic	pro-
teoglycans,	heparin	and	chondroitin	sulfate	E,	with	which	they	func-
tion	as	a	complex.	Histamine	and	the	various	lipid	mediators	(PGD2,

FIGURE 352-2  Bioactive mediators of three categories generated by IgE-dependent activation of murine mast cells can elicit common but sequential target cell effects 
leading to acute and sustained inflammatory responses. GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; LT, leukotriene; PAF,

LTC4/D4/E4,	PAF)	alter	venular	permeability,	thereby	allowing	influx	of	
plasma	proteins	such	as	complement	and	immunoglobulins,	whereas	
LTB4	 mediates	 leukocyte–endothelial	 cell	 adhesion	 and	 subsequent	
directed	migration	(chemotaxis).	The	accumulation	of	leukocytes	and	
plasma	 opsonins	 facilitates	 defense	 of	 the	 microenvironment.	 The	
inflammatory	 response	 can	 also	 be	 detrimental,	 as	 in	 asthma,	 where	
the	smooth-muscle	constrictor	activity	of	the	cysteinyl	leukotrienes	is	
evident	and	much	more	potent	than	that	of	histamine.

The	 cellular	 component	 of	 the	 mast	 cell–mediated	 inflammatory	
response	 is	 augmented	 and	 sustained	 by	 cytokines	 and	 chemokines.	
IgE-dependent	activation	of	human	skin	mast	cells	in	situ	elicits	TNF-α	
production	and	release,	which	in	turn	induces	endothelial	cell	responses	
favoring	leukocyte	adhesion.	Similarly,	activation	of	purified	human	lung	
mast	cells	or	cord	blood–derived	cultured	mast	cells	in	vitro	results	in	
substantial	production	of	proinflammatory	(TNF-α)	and	immunomod-
ulatory	cytokines	(IL-4,	IL-5,	IL-13)	and	chemokines.	Bronchial	biopsy	
specimens	from	patients	with	asthma	reveal	that	mast	cells	are	immu-
nohistochemically	positive	for	IL-4	and	IL-5,	but	that	the	predominant	
localization	of	IL-4,	IL-5,	and	GM-CSF	is	to	T	cells,	defined	as	TH2	by	this	
profile.	IL-4	modulates	the	T-cell	phenotype	to	the	TH2	subtype,	deter-
mines	the	isotype	switch	to	IgE	(as	does	IL-13),	and	upregulates	FcεRI-
mediated	expression	of	cytokines	by	mast	cells	based	on	in	vitro	studies.
An	immediate	and	late	cellular	phase	of	allergic	inflammation	can	be	
induced	in	the	skin,	nose,	or	lung	of	some	allergic	humans	with	local	
allergen	challenge.	The	immediate	phase	in	the	nose	involves	pruritus	
and	watery	discharge;	in	the	lung,	it	involves	bronchospasm	and	mucus	
secretion;	and	in	the	skin,	it	involves	a	wheal-and-flare	response	with	
pruritus.	 Diminished	 nasal	 patency,	 reduced	 pulmonary	 function,	 or	
erythema	with	swelling	at	the	skin	site	in	a	late-phase	response	at	6–8	h	
is	associated	with	biopsy	findings	of	infiltrating	and	activated	TH2	cells,	
eosinophils,	 basophils,	 and	 some	 neutrophils.	 The	 progression	 from	
early	mast	cell	activation	to	late	cellular	infiltration	has	been	used	as	
an	experimental	surrogate	of	rhinitis	or	asthma.	However,	in	asthma,	
there	is	an	intrinsic	hyperreactivity	of	the	airways	independent	of	the	
associated	inflammation.	Moreover,	early-	and	late-phase	responses	(at	
least	in	the	lung)	are	far	more	sensitive	to	blockade	of	IgE-dependent	
mast	cell	activation	(or	actions	of	histamine	and	cysteinyl	leukotrienes)	
than	are	spontaneous	or	virally	induced	asthma	exacerbations.

Consideration	of	the	mechanism	of	immediate-type	hypersensitivity	
diseases	in	the	human	has	focused	largely	on	the	IgE-dependent	rec-
ognition	of	otherwise	innocuous	substances.	A	region	of	chromosome	
5	 (5q23-31)	 contains	 genes	 implicated	 in	 the	 control	 of	 IgE	 levels	
including	IL-4	and	IL-13,	as	well	as	IL-3	and	IL-9,	which	are	involved	
in	 mucosal	 mast	 cell	 hyperplasia,	 and	 IL-5	 and	 GM-CSF,	 which	 are	

central	to	eosinophil	development	and	their	enhanced	tissue	viability.	
Genes	with	linkage	to	the	specific	IgE	response	to	particular	allergens	
include	those	encoding	the	major	histocompatibility	complex	(MHC)	
and	certain	chains	of	the	T-cell	receptor	(TCR-αδ).	The	complexity	of	
atopy	and	the	associated	diseases	includes	susceptibility,	severity,	and	
therapeutic	responses,	each	of	which	is	among	the	separate	variables	
modulated	by	both	innate	and	adaptive	immune	stimuli.

The	 induction	 of	 allergic	 disease	 requires	 sensitization	 of	 a	 pre-
disposed	individual	to	a	specific	allergen.	The	greatest	propensity	for	
the	development	of	atopic	allergy	occurs	in	childhood	and	early	ado-
lescence.	 The	 allergen	 is	 processed	 by	 antigen-presenting	 cells	 of	 the	
monocytic	lineage	(particularly	dendritic	cells)	located	throughout	the	
body	at	epithelial	surfaces	that	contact	the	outside	environment,	such	
as	the	nose,	lungs,	eyes,	skin,	and	intestine.	These	antigen-presenting	
cells	present	the	epitope-bearing	peptides	via	their	MHC	to	T	helper	
cells	and	their	subsets.	The	T-cell	response	depends	both	on	cognate	
recognition	 and	 on	 the	 cytokine	 microenvironment	 provided	 by	 the	
antigen-presenting	 dendritic	 cells,	 with	 IL-4	 directing	 a	 TH2	 subset,	
interferon	 (IFN)	 γ	 a	 TH1	 profile,	 and	 IL-6	 with	 transforming	 growth	
factor	β	(TGF-β)	a	TH17	subset.	Allergens	can	induce	an	epithelial	alar-
min	response,	with	expression	of	IL-25,	TSLP,	and	IL-33,	which	stimu-
late	group	2	innate	lymphoid	cells,	which	can	generate	large	quantities	
of	IL-5	and	IL-13.	Allergens	also	contain	pattern	recognition	ligands	
that	facilitate	the	immune	response	by	direct	initiation	of	cytokine	gen-
eration	from	innate	cell	types	such	as	basophils,	mast	cells,	eosinophils,	
and	others.	The	TH2	response	is	associated	with	activation	of	specific	
B	 cells	 that	 can	 also	 present	 allergens	 or	 that	 transform	 into	 plasma	
cells	for	antibody	production.	Synthesis	and	release	into	the	plasma	of	
allergen-specific	IgE	results	in	sensitization	of	FcεR1-bearing	cells	such	
as	mast	cells	and	basophils,	which	become	activated	on	exposure	to	the	
specific	 allergen.	 In	 certain	 diseases,	 including	 those	 associated	 with	
atopy,	the	monocyte	and	eosinophil	populations	can	express	a	trimeric	
FcεR1,	which	lacks	the	β	chain,	and	yet	respond	to	its	aggregation.

URTICARIA AND ANGIOEDEMA
 ■ DEFINITION
Urticaria	and	angioedema	represent	the	same	pathophysiologic	process	
occurring	 at	 different	 levels	 of	 the	 skin.	 Urticaria	 involves	 dilation	
of	 vascular	 structures	 in	 the	 superficial	 dermis,	 while	 angioedema	
originates	 from	 the	 deeper	 dermis	 and	 subcutaneous	 tissues.	 Not	
surprisingly,	they	often	appear	together,	with	roughly	40%	of	patients	
reporting	 both,	 and	 affect	 >20%	 of	 the	 population	 at	 some	 time	
during	 their	 life	 span.	 Urticaria	 can	 occur	 on	 any	 area	 of	 the	 body

2722 as	 well-circumscribed	 wheals	 with	 erythematous	 raised	 serpiginous	
borders	 and	 blanched	 centers	 that	 may	 coalesce	 to	 become	 giant	
wheals.	 Urticarial	 lesions	 last	 for	 <24	 h,	 are	 intensely	 pruritic,	 fre-
quently	 migrate	 around	 the	 body,	 and	 leave	 no	 bruising	 or	 scarring.	
Angioedema	 is	 marked	 by	 dramatic	 swelling	 with	 more	 pain	 than	
pruritus	 and	 minimal	 erythema,	 which	 may	 develop	 with	 a	 pruritic	
prodrome	 and	 takes	 hours	 to	 days	 to	 resolve.	 Acute	 urticaria	 and/or	
angioedema	 are	 episodes	 that	 occur	 for	 <6	 weeks’	 duration,	 whereas	
attacks	persisting	for	>6	weeks	are	designated	chronic.

 ■ PREDISPOSING FACTORS AND ETIOLOGY
Acute	or	chronic	urticaria	and/or	angioedema	can	occur	at	any	point	
in	the	life	span	with	the	third	to	fifth	decades	the	most	common	for	
chronic	disease.	Women	are	affected	more	often	than	men	with	a	slight	
predominance	for	those	with	a	history	of	atopy.	Acute	urticaria	is	most	
often	the	result	of	exposure	to	a	food,	environmental,	or	drug	allergen	
or	 viral	 infection,	 while	 chronic	 urticaria	 is	 often	 idiopathic.	 More	
than	two-thirds	of	new-onset	urticaria	cases	are	ultimately	diagnosed	
as	acute.

The	classification	of	urticaria-angioedema	presented	in	Table 352-1	
focuses	on	the	different	mechanisms	for	eliciting	clinical	disease	and	
can	be	useful	for	differential	diagnosis.

Additional	 etiologies	 include	 physical	 stimuli	 such	 as	 cold,	 heat,	
solar	 UV	 radiation,	 exercise,	 and	 mechanical	 irritation.	 The	 physical	
urticarias	 can	 be	 distinguished	 by	 the	 precipitating	 event	 and	 other	
aspects	 of	 the	 clinical	 presentation.	 Dermatographism,	 which	 occurs	
in	 2–5%	 of	 the	 population,	 is	 defined	 by	 the	 appearance	 of	 a	 linear	
wheal	with	surrounding	erythema	at	the	site	of	a	brisk	stroke	with	a	
firm	object	(Fig. 352-3).	Dermatographism	has	a	prevalence	that	peaks	
in	the	second	to	third	decades.	It	is	not	influenced	by	atopy	and	has	a	
duration	generally	of	<5	years.	Pressure urticaria,	which	often	accom-
panies	chronic	idiopathic	urticaria,	presents	in	response	to	a	sustained	
stimulus	 such	 as	 a	 shoulder	 strap	 or	 belt,	 running	 (feet),	 or	 manual	
labor	 (hands).	 Cholinergic  urticaria	 is	 distinctive	 in	 that	 the	 pruritic	
wheals	are	of	small	size	(1–2	mm)	and	are	surrounded	by	a	large	area	
of	erythema;	attacks	are	precipitated	by	fever,	a	hot	bath	or	shower,	or	
exercise	and	are	presumptively	attributed	to	a	rise	in	core	body	tem-
perature.	Exercise-induced anaphylaxis	can	be	precipitated	by	exertion	
alone	or	can	be	dependent	on	food	ingestion	prior	to	exercise.	There	is	
an	association	with	the	presence	of	IgE	specific	for	α-5	gliadin,	a	com-
ponent	of	wheat.	The	clinical	presentation	can	be	limited	to	flushing,	
erythema,	and	pruritic	urticaria	but	may	progress	to	angioedema	of	the

face,	oropharynx,	larynx,	or	intestine	and/or	to	vascular	collapse;	it	is	
distinguished	from	cholinergic	urticaria	by	presenting	with	wheals	of	
conventional	size	and	by	not	occurring	with	passive	heating.	Solar urti-
caria	is	subdivided	into	six	groups	by	the	response	to	specific	portions	
of	the	light	spectrum.	Cold urticaria	is	local	at	body	areas	exposed	to	
low	ambient	temperature	or	cold	objects	but	can	progress	to	vascular	
collapse	with	immersion	in	cold	water	(swimming).	Vibratory urticaria 
and  angioedema	 may	 occur	 after	 years	 of	 occupational	 exposure	 or	
can	be	idiopathic;	it	may	be	accompanied	by	cholinergic	urticaria.	In	
rare	 cases,	 variants	 of	 cold	 and	 vibratory	 urticaria	 are	 inherited	 and	
syndromic	 conditions,	 with	 mutations	 in	 the	 NLRP3	 component	 of	
inflammasome	 leading	 to	 familial	 cold	 autoinflammatory	 syndrome,	
and	mutations	in	the	mast	cell	mechanoreceptor	ADGRE2	associated	
with	familial	vibratory	urticaria.	Other	rare	forms	of	physical	allergy,	
always	defined	by	stimulus-specific	elicitation,	include	local heat urti-
caria,	aquagenic urticaria	from	contact	with	water	of	any	temperature	
(sometimes	associated	with	polycythemia	vera),	and	contact urticaria	
from	direct	interaction	with	some	chemical	substance	(such	as	latex).

Isolated  Angioedema  Angioedema	 without	 urticaria	 can	 be	
idiopathic	or	due	to	the	generation	of	bradykinin	in	the	setting	of	C1	
inhibitor	 (C1INH)	 deficiency	 that	 may	 be	 inborn	 as	 an	 autosomal	
dominant	mutation	or	may	be	acquired	through	the	appearance	of	an	
autoantibody	in	the	setting	of	malignancy	or	autoimmune	disease.	The	
angiotensin-converting	enzyme	(ACE)	inhibitors	can	provoke	a	similar	
clinical	 presentation	 in	 0.2–0.7%	 of	 exposed	 patients	 due	 to	 delayed	
degradation	of	bradykinin.	Black	race,	organ	transplant,	female	gender,	
smoking,	and	increasing	age	are	known	risk	factors	for	ACE	inhibitor–
related	angioedema.

 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND 
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Urticarial	 eruptions	 are	 distinctly	 pruritic,	 may	 involve	 any	 area	 of	
the	body	from	the	scalp	to	the	soles	of	the	feet,	and	appear	in	crops	of	
12-	to	36-h	duration,	with	old	lesions	fading	as	new	ones	appear.	Most	
of	the	physical	urticarias	(cold,	cholinergic,	dermatographism)	are	an	
exception,	 with	 individual	 lesions	 lasting	 <2	 h.	 Neither	 urticaria	 nor	
angioedema	lesions	are	symmetric	or	dependent	in	distribution.	The	
most	common	sites	for	angioedema	are	often	periorbital	and	perioral.	
Angioedema	of	the	upper	respiratory	tract	may	be	life-threatening	due	
to	 transient	 laryngeal	 obstruction,	 whereas	 gastrointestinal	 involve-
ment	may	present	with	abdominal	colic,	with	or	without	nausea	and	
vomiting,	 and	 can	 result	 in	 unnecessary	 surgical	 intervention.	 No	
residual	 scarring	 occurs	 with	 either	 urticaria	 or	 angioedema	 unless	
there	is	an	underlying	vasculitic	process.

The	 pathology	 is	 characterized	 by	 edema	 of	 the	 superficial	 der-
mis	 in	 urticaria	 and	 of	 the	 subcutaneous	 tissue	 and	 deep	 dermis	 in	
angioedema.	Collagen	bundles	in	affected	areas	are	widely	separated,	
and	the	venules	are	sometimes	dilated.	Any	perivenular	infiltrate	con-
sists	of	lymphocytes,	monocytes,	eosinophils,	and	neutrophils	that	are	
present	in	varying	combination	and	numbers.

The	 best	 evidence	 for	 IgE	 and	 mast	 cell	 involvement	 in	 urticaria	
and	 angioedema	 is	 cold  urticaria.	 Cryoglobulins	 or	 cold	 agglutinins	
are	present	in	up	to	5%	of	these	patients.	Ice	cube	placement	on	the

volar	forearm	precipitates	urticaria	or	angioedema	within	minutes	of	
the	 challenge.	 Histologic	 studies	 reveal	 marked	 mast	 cell	 degranula-
tion	 with	 associated	 edema	 of	 the	 dermis	 and	 subcutaneous	 tissues.	
Elevated	levels	of	histamine	have	been	found	in	the	plasma	of	venous	
effluent	and	in	the	fluid	of	suction	blisters	at	experimentally	induced	
lesional	sites	in	patients	with	cold	urticaria,	dermographism,	pressure	
urticaria,	vibratory	angioedema,	light	urticaria,	and	heat	urticaria.	By	
ultrastructural	analysis,	the	pattern	of	mast	cell	degranulation	in	cold	
urticaria	 resembles	 an	 IgE-mediated	 response	 with	 solubilization	 of	
granule	contents,	fusion	of	the	perigranular	and	cell	membranes,	and	
discharge	 of	 granule	 contents,	 whereas	 in	 a	 dermatographic	 lesion,	
there	 is	 additional	 superimposed	 zonal	 (piecemeal)	 degranulation.	
Elevations	 of	 plasma	 histamine	 levels	 with	 biopsy-proven	 mast	 cell	
degranulation	have	also	been	demonstrated	with	generalized	attacks	of	
cholinergic urticaria.

Up	to	45%	of	patients	with	chronic	urticaria	have	an	autoimmune	
cause	 for	 their	 disease	 including	 autoantibodies	 to	 IgE	 or	 to	 the	 α	
chain	of	FcεRI.	In	some	patients,	autologous	serum	injected	into	their	
own	 skin	 can	 induce	 a	 wheal-and-flare	 reaction	 involving	 mast	 cell	
activation.	The	presence	of	these	antibodies	can	also	be	recognized	by	
their	capacity	to	release	histamine	or	induce	activation	markers	such	
as	 CD63	 or	 CD203	 on	 basophils.	 An	 association	 with	 antibodies	 to	
microsomal	peroxidase	and/or	thyroglobulin	has	been	observed	with	
both	clinically	significant	Hashimoto’s	thyroiditis	as	well	as	a	euthyroid	
state.

The	 urticaria	 and	 angioedema	 associated	 with	 classic	 serum	 sick-
ness	 or	 with	 hypocomplementemic	 cutaneous	 necrotizing	 angiitis	
(urticarial	 vasculitis)	 are	 believed	 to	 be	 immune-complex-mediated	
diseases.

Isolated  Angioedema  Hereditary	 angioedema	 (HAE)	 is	 a	 fully	
penetrant,	 autosomal	 dominant	 disease	 due	 to	 a	 mutation	 in	 the	
SERPING1	gene	leading	to	a	deficiency	of	C1INH	(type	1)	in	~85%	of	
patients	or	to	a	dysfunctional	protein	(type	2)	in	the	remainder	affect-
ing	1:30,000–80,000	in	the	general	population.	A	third,	less	common	
type	of	HAE	has	been	described	in	which	C1INH	function	is	normal,	
and	 the	 causal	 lesion	 is	 a	 mutant	 form	 of	 factor	 XII,	 which	 leads	 to	
generation	of	excessive	bradykinin.	C1INH	deficiency	can	also	develop	
in	 a	 sporadic	 acquired	 form	 as	 a	 result	 of	 excessive	 consumption	 of	
C1INH	due	either	to	formation	of	immune	complexes	or	to	the	gen-
eration	 of	 an	 autoantibody	 directed	 to	 C1INH	 in	 the	 setting	 of	 lym-
phoproliferative	 or	 autoimmune	 disease.	 C1INH	 blocks	 the	 catalytic	
function	 of	 activated	 factor	 XII	 (Hageman	 factor)	 and	 of	 kallikrein,	
as	well	as	the	C1r/C1s	components	of	C1,	with	the	common	result	of	
degrading	bradykinin.	During	clinical	attacks	of	angioedema,	C1INH	
function	or	levels	fall,	patients	develop	elevated	plasma	levels	of	bra-
dykinin	leading	to	angioedema,	and	excessive	activation	of	C1	results	
in	a	decline	in	C4	and	C2	levels.

The	use	of	ACE	inhibitors	results	in	impaired	bradykinin	degrada-
tion,	 which	 explains	 the	 idiosyncratic	 angioedema	 that	 can	 occur	 in	
ACE	 inhibitor–exposed	 patients	 with	 a	 normal	 C1INH.	 Bradykinin-
mediated	angioedema,	whether	caused	by	ACE	inhibitors	or	by	C1INH	
deficiency,	is	noteworthy	for	the	conspicuous	absence	of	concomitant	
urticaria	or	pruritus,	the	frequent	involvement	of	the	gastrointestinal	
tract,	and	the	duration	of	symptoms	>24	h.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	 classification	 of	 urticaria	 and	 angioedema	 as	 presented	 in	 Table	
352-1	 in	 terms	 of	 duration	 can	 facilitate	 identification	 of	 possible	
mechanisms.	 History	 alone	 of	 self-limited	 episodes	 can	 be	 sufficient	
to	make	a	diagnosis	in	the	setting	of	acute	disease	triggered	by	drug,	
environmental,	 or	 food	 allergen	 with	 history-directed	 confirmatory	
skin	testing	or	assay	for	serum	allergen-specific	IgE.	Direct	reproduc-
tion	of	the	lesion	in	physical	urticarias	is	particularly	valuable	because	
it	 so	 often	 establishes	 the	 cause	 of	 the	 lesion.	 In	 chronic	 urticaria/
angioedema,	initial	diagnostic	testing	should	be	guided	by	history	and	
physical	 exam.	 Practice	 guidelines	 provide	 clinicians	 two	 options	 if	
history	and	physical	exam	are	unrevealing:	no	laboratory	testing	or	lim-
ited	testing,	which	includes	complete	blood	count	with	assessment	for	

eosinophilia,	 erythrocyte	 sedimentation	 rate,	 and	 thyroid-stimulating		
hormone	level.	The	vast	majority	of	chronic	urticaria	is	associated	with	
no	laboratory	abnormality.	Urticarial	lesions	that	last	longer	than	36	h,	
result	in	scarring,	and	are	reported	as	painful	and	not	pruritic	warrant	
biopsy	to	evaluate	for	cellular	infiltration,	nuclear	debris,	and	fibrinoid	
necrosis	 of	 the	 venules	 consistent	 with	 urticarial	 vasculitis.	 Chronic	
angioedema	 without	 urticaria	 warrants	 assessment	 of	 complement	
levels.	Concomitant	flushing	and	hyperpigmented	papules	that	urticate	
with	stroking	in	the	absence	of	angioedema	raise	the	question	of	mas-
tocytosis.	 An	 appropriate	 travel	 history	 should	 trigger	 an	 evaluation	
for	parasites.

The	 diagnosis	 of	 HAE	 is	 suggested	 not	 only	 by	 family	 history	 but	
also	by	the	lack	of	pruritus	and	of	urticarial	lesions,	the	prominence	
of	recurrent	gastrointestinal	attacks	of	colic,	and	episodes	of	laryngeal	
edema.	Laboratory	diagnosis	depends	on	demonstrating	a	deficiency	
of	 C1INH	 antigen	 (type	 1)	 or	 a	 nonfunctional	 protein	 (type	 2)	 by	 a	
catalytic	inhibition	assay.	C4	and	C2	are	chronically	depleted	and	fall	
further	during	attacks	due	to	the	activation	of	additional	C1.	Patients	
with	 the	 acquired	 forms	 of	 C1INH	 deficiency	 have	 the	 same	 clinical	
manifestations	but	differ	in	the	lack	of	a	familial	element.	Furthermore,	
their	sera	exhibit	a	reduction	of	C1	function	and	C1q	protein	as	well	as	
C1INH,	C4,	and	C2.	Lastly,	type	3	HAE	is	associated	with	normal	levels	
of	complement	proteins	and	a	factor	XII	gene	mutation.

TREATMENT
Urticaria and Angioedema

For	most	forms	of	urticaria,	H1	antihistamines	effectively	attenuate	
both	urtication	and	pruritus;	long-acting,	nonsedating	agents,	such	
as	 loratadine,	 desloratadine,	 and	 fexofenadine,	 or	 low-sedating	
agents,	such	as	cetirizine	or	levocetirizine,	generally	are	used	first	
and	 can	 be	 increased	 to	 up	 to	 four	 times	 daily	 dosing.	 Earlier	
generation	antihistamines,	such	as	chlorpheniramine	or	diphenhy-
dramine,	are	sedating,	and	they	induce	psychomotor	impairment,	
including	 reduced	 eye-hand	 coordination	 and	 machine	 operating	
skills.	Their	anticholinergic	(muscarinic)	effects	include	visual	dis-
turbance,	 urinary	 retention,	 and	 constipation.	 Clinical	 practice	
guidelines	 indicate	 that	 the	 addition	 of	 an	 H2	 antagonist	 such	 as	
ranitidine	 or	 famotidine	 in	 conventional	 dosages	 and	 a	 CysLT1	
receptor	 antagonist,	 such	 as	 montelukast	 10	 mg	 daily	 or	 zafirlu-
kast	 20	 mg	 twice	 a	 day,	 may	 add	 benefit	 when	 H1	 antihistamines	
are	inadequate.	For	chronic	urticaria	that	has	failed	to	respond	to	
the	 above	 combinations,	 monoclonal	 anti-IgE	 antibodies	 such	 as	
omalizumab	 are	 now	 the	 next	 line	 of	 therapy.	 Older	 agents	 with	
antihistamine	 properties	 such	 as	 doxepin,	 cyproheptadine,	 and	
hydroxyzine	have	proven	effective	when	H1	antihistamines	fail	but	
are	less	effective	than	omalizumab	and	are	sedating.

Topical	 glucocorticoids	 are	 of	 no	 value,	 and	 systemic	 gluco-
corticoids	 are	 generally	 avoided	 in	 idiopathic,	 allergen-induced,	
or	 physical	 urticarias	 due	 to	 their	 long-term	 toxicity.	 Systemic	
glucocorticoids	 are	 useful	 in	 the	 management	 of	 patients	 with	
pressure	 urticaria,	 vasculitic	 urticaria	 (especially	 with	 eosinophil	
prominence),	idiopathic	angioedema	with	or	without	urticaria,	or	
chronic	 urticaria	 that	 responds	 poorly	 to	 conventional	 treatment	
and	should	be	considered	in	any	patient	with	debilitating	disease.	
With	persistent	vasculitic	urticaria,	hydroxychloroquine,	dapsone,	
or	colchicine	may	be	added	to	the	regimen	before	or	along	with	sys-
temic	glucocorticoids.	Cyclosporine	is	efficacious	for	patients	with	
chronic	idiopathic	urticaria	that	is	severe	and	poorly	responsive	to	
other	modalities	and/or	when	glucocorticoids	are	a	requirement.	
BRADYKININ-MEDIATED ANGIOEDEMA
Infusion	 of	 plasma-derived	 C1INH	 protein	 and	 lanadelumab,	 a	
monoclonal	 antiplasma	 kallikrein	 antibody,	 is	 approved	 for	 pro-
phylaxis	 of	 HAE	 attacks.	 Administration	 of	 plasma-derived	 or	
recombinant	 C1INH	 protein,	 a	 bradykinin	 2	 receptor	 antagonist	
(icatibant),	 or	 a	 kallikrein	 inhibitor	 (ecallantide)	 may	 be	 used	
for	 treatment	 of	 an	 acute	 attack	 of	 HAE.	 Older,	 less	 expensive

preventative	 options	 include	 attenuated	 androgens,	 which	 stim-
ulate	 production	 by	 the	 normal	 gene	 of	 an	 amount	 of	 functional	
C1INH.	 The	 antifibrinolytic	 agent	 ε-aminocaproic	 acid	 may	 be	
used	for	preoperative	prophylaxis	but	is	contraindicated	in	patients	
with	thrombotic	tendencies	or	arterial	atherosclerosis.	Fresh	frozen	
plasma	infusion	can	be	used	for	acute	attacks	in	a	setting	that	lacks	
access	to	newer	modalities.	Published	studies	are	conflicting	on	the	
efficacy	of	bradykinin	2	receptor	antagonists	and	C1INH	protein	in	
the	treatment	of	ACE	inhibitor–induced	angioedema.	Treatment	of	
the	underlying	autoimmune	disease	or	malignancy	is	indicated	for	
acquired	C1INH	deficiency.

ALLERGIC RHINITIS
 ■ DEFINITION
Rhinitis	 is	 characterized	 by	 sneezing;	 rhinorrhea;	 obstruction	 of	 the	
nasal	passages;	conjunctival,	nasal,	and	pharyngeal	itching;	and	lacri-
mation	and	can	be	classified	as	allergic	or	nonallergic.	A	clinical	history	
of	rhinitis	symptoms	occurring	in	a	temporal	relationship	to	allergen	
exposure	 and	 documentation	 of	 sensitization	 to	 an	 environmental	
allergen	 are	 required	 for	 a	 diagnosis	 of	 allergic	 rhinitis.	 Although	
commonly	 seasonal	 due	 to	 elicitation	 by	 airborne	 pollens,	 it	 can	 be	
perennial	in	an	environment	of	chronic	exposure	to	house	dust	mites,	
animal	danders,	or	insect	(cockroach)	products.	The	overall	prevalence	
in	 North	 America	 has	 increased	 in	 the	 past	 20	 years	 and	 is	 10–30%,	
with	the	peak	prevalence	of	>30%	occurring	in	the	fifth	decade.

 ■ PREDISPOSING FACTORS AND ETIOLOGY
Allergic	rhinitis	generally	occurs	in	atopic	individuals,	often	in	asso-
ciation	 with	 atopic	 dermatitis,	 food	 allergy,	 urticaria,	 and/or	 asthma	
(Chap.  287).	 Up	 to	 50%	 of	 patients	 with	 allergic	 rhinitis	 manifest	
asthma,	 whereas	 70–80%	 of	 individuals	 with	 asthma	 and	 80%	 of	
individuals	with	chronic	bilateral	sinusitis	experience	allergic	rhinitis.	
Female	 sex,	 particulate	 air	 pollution	 exposure,	 and	 maternal	 tobacco	
smoking	increase	the	risk	of	developing	allergic	rhinitis.

Wind-pollinated	trees,	grasses,	and	weeds	produce	sufficient	quan-
tities	 of	 pollen	 suitable	 for	 wide	 distribution	 by	 air	 currents	 to	 elicit	
seasonal	 allergic	 rhinitis.	 The	 dates	 of	 pollination	 of	 these	 species	
historically	varied	little	from	year	to	year	in	a	particular	locale	but	may	
be	quite	different	in	another	climate.	In	the	temperate	areas	of	North	
America,	 trees	 typically	 pollinate	 from	 March	 through	 May,	 grasses	
in	June	and	early	July,	and	weeds	from	mid-August	to	early	October.	
Molds,	which	are	widespread	in	nature	because	they	occur	in	soil	or	
decaying	organic	matter,	propagate	spores	in	a	pattern	that	depends	on	
climatic	 conditions.	 Climate	 change	 is	 impacting	 these	 patterns	 with	
early	tree	pollination	and	prolonged	ragweed	season	with	the	delay	of	
the	first	frost.	In	laboratory	studies,	exposure	to	high	carbon	dioxide	
concentrations	 increases	 pollen	 production	 in	 ragweed	 and	 timothy	
grass.	 Perennial	 allergic	 rhinitis	 occurs	 in	 response	 to	 allergens	 that	
are	present	throughout	the	year,	including	animal	dander,	cockroach-	
derived	proteins,	mold	spores,	or	dust	mites	such	as	Dermatophagoides 
farinae	 and	 Dermatophagoides  pteronyssinus.	 Dust	 mites	 are	 scaven-
gers	 of	 human	 skin	 and	 excrete	 cysteine	 protease	 allergens	 in		
their	feces.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND MANIFESTATIONS
Episodic	rhinorrhea,	sneezing,	obstruction	of	the	nasal	passages	with	
lacrimation,	and	pruritus	of	the	conjunctiva,	nasal	mucosa,	and	oro-
pharynx	are	the	hallmarks	of	allergic	rhinitis.	The	nasal	mucosa	is	pale	
and	 boggy,	 the	 conjunctiva	 congested	 and	 edematous,	 and	 the	 phar-
ynx	 generally	 unremarkable.	 Swelling	 of	 the	 turbinates	 and	 mucous	
membranes	 with	 obstruction	 of	 the	 sinus	 ostia	 and	 eustachian	 tubes	
precipitates	secondary	infections	of	the	sinuses	and	middle	ear,	respec-
tively.	 A	 growing	 number	 of	 patients	 with	 seasonal	 allergic	 rhinitis	
demonstrate	 pollen-associated	 food	 allergen	 syndrome	 characterized	
by	oropharyngeal	pruritus	and/or	mild	swelling	following	the	ingestion	
of	plant-based	foods	in	the	same	plant	family	as	a	tree,	grass,	or	weed,	
which	contain	cross-reacting	allergens.

The	 nose	 presents	 a	 large	 mucosal	 surface	 area	 through	 the	 folds	
of	 the	 turbinates	 and	 serves	 to	 adjust	 the	 temperature	 and	 moisture	
content	 of	 inhaled	 air	 and	 to	 filter	 out	 particulate	 materials	 >10	 μm	
in	size	by	impingement	in	a	mucous	blanket;	ciliary	action	moves	the	
entrapped	 particles	 toward	 the	 pharynx.	 Entrapment	 of	 pollen	 and	
digestion	 of	 the	 outer	 coat	 by	 mucosal	 enzymes	 such	 as	 lysozymes	
release	 protein	 allergens.	 The	 initial	 interaction	 occurs	 between	 the	
allergen	 and	 intraepithelial	 mast	 cells	 and	 then	 proceeds	 to	 involve	
deeper	 perivenular	 mast	 cells,	 both	 of	 which	 are	 sensitized	 with	
specific	 IgE.	 During	 the	 symptomatic	 season	 when	 the	 mucosae	 are	
already	 swollen	 and	 hyperemic,	 there	 is	 enhanced	 adverse	 reactivity	
to	the	seasonal	pollen	as	well	as	irritants	such	as	tobacco	smoke	and	
fragrances.	Biopsy	specimens	of	nasal	mucosa	during	seasonal	rhinitis	
show	 submucosal	 edema	 with	 infiltration	 by	 eosinophils,	 along	 with	
some	basophils	and	neutrophils.

The	mucosal	surface	fluid	contains	IgA	and	IgE,	which	apparently	
arrives	by	diffusion	from	plasma	cells	in	proximity	to	mucosal	surfaces.	
IgE	 fixes	 to	 mucosal	 and	 submucosal	 mast	 cells,	 and	 the	 intensity	
of	 the	 clinical	 response	 to	 inhaled	 allergens	 is	 quantitatively	 related	
to	 the	 naturally	 occurring	 pollen	 dose.	 In	 sensitive	 individuals,	 the	
introduction	 of	 allergen	 into	 the	 nose	 is	 associated	 with	 sneezing,	
nasal	 obstruction,	 and	 discharge,	 and	 the	 fluid	 contains	 histamine,	
PGD2,	and	leukotrienes.	Thus,	the	mast	cells	of	the	nasal	mucosa	and	
submucosa	 generate	 and	 release	 mediators	 through	 IgE-dependent	
reactions	that	are	capable	of	producing	tissue	edema	and	eosinophilic		
infiltration.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	 diagnosis	 of	 seasonal	 allergic	 rhinitis	 depends	 largely	 on	 an	
accurate	history	of	occurrence	coincident	with	the	pollination	of	the	
offending	weeds,	grasses,	or	trees.	The	continuous	character	of	peren-
nial	allergic	rhinitis	due	to	contamination	of	the	home	or	place	of	work	
makes	historic	analysis	difficult,	but	there	may	be	variability	in	symp-
toms	that	can	be	related	to	exposure	to	animal	dander,	dust	mite	and/
or	cockroach	allergens,	fungal	spores,	or	work-related	allergens	such	as	
latex.	Patients	with	perennial	rhinitis	commonly	develop	the	problem	
in	adult	life	and	manifest	nasal	congestion	and	a	postnasal	discharge,	
often	associated	with	thickening	of	the	sinus	membranes	demonstrated	
by	 radiography.	 Perennial	 nonallergic	 rhinitis	 with	 eosinophilia	 syn-
drome	(NARES)	occurs	in	the	middle	decades	of	life	and	is	character-
ized	 by	 nasal	 obstruction,	 anosmia,	 chronic	 sinusitis,	 and	 prominent	
eosinophilic	 nasal	 discharge	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 allergen	 sensitization.	
The	 term	 vasomotor  rhinitis	 or	 perennial  nonallergic  rhinitis	 desig-
nates	a	condition	of	enhanced	reactivity	of	the	nasopharynx	in	which	
a	 symptom	 complex	 resembling	 perennial	 allergic	 rhinitis	 occurs	
with	 nonspecific	 stimuli,	 including	 chemical	 odors,	 temperature	 and	
humidity	 variations,	 and	 position	 changes	 but	 occurs	 without	 tissue	
eosinophilia	or	an	allergic	etiology.	Other	entities	to	be	excluded	are	
structural	abnormalities	of	the	nasopharynx;	exposure	to	irritants;	gus-
tatory	rhinitis	associated	with	cholinergic	activation	that	occurs	while	
eating	 or	 ingesting	 alcohol;	 hypothyroidism;	 upper	 respiratory	 tract	
infection;	pregnancy	with	prominent	nasal	mucosal	edema;	prolonged	
topical	use	of	α-adrenergic	agents	in	the	form	of	nasal	sprays	(rhinitis	
medicamentosa);	 and	 the	 use	 of	 certain	 systemic	 agents	 such	 as	 β-	
adrenergic	 antagonists,	 ACE	 inhibitors,	 direct	 vasodilators	 (hydrala-
zine),	α1-adrenergic	receptor	antagonists,	estrogens,	progesterone,	non-
steroidal	 anti-inflammatory	 drugs,	 gabapentin,	 phosphodiesterase-5	
inhibitors,	 and	 psychotropics	
(risperidone,	 chlorpromazine,	
amitriptyline).

The	nasal	secretions	of	allergic	patients	are	rich	in	eosinophils,	and	
a	 modest	 peripheral	 eosinophilia	 can	 be	 observed.	 Local	 or	 systemic	
neutrophilia	implies	infection.	Total	serum	IgE	is	frequently	elevated,	
but	 the	 demonstration	 of	 immunologic	 specificity	 for	 IgE	 is	 critical	
to	 an	 etiologic	 diagnosis.	 A	 skin	 test	 by	 the	 intracutaneous	 route	
(puncture	or	prick)	with	the	allergens	of	interest	provides	a	rapid	and	
reliable	 approach	 to	 identifying	 allergen-specific	 IgE	 that	 has	 sensi-
tized	 cutaneous	 mast	 cells.	 A	 positive	 intracutaneous	 skin	 test	 with	
1:10–1:20	weight/volume	of	extract	has	a	high	predictive	value	for	the	
presence	of	allergy.	An	intradermal	test	with	a	1:500–1:1000	dilution	of

0.05	 mL	 may	 follow	 if	 indicated	 by	 history	 when	 the	 intracutaneous	
test	is	negative,	but	while	more	sensitive,	it	is	less	reliable	due	to	the	
reactivity	of	some	asymptomatic	individuals	at	the	test	dose.

Newer	methodology	for	detecting	total	IgE,	including	the	develop-
ment	 of	 enzyme-linked	 immunosorbent	 assays	 (ELISAs)	 employing	
anti-IgE	 bound	 to	 either	 a	 solid-phase	 or	 a	 liquid-phase	 particle,	
provides	 rapid	 and	 cost-effective	 determinations.	 Measurements	 of	
specific	anti-IgE	in	serum	are	obtained	by	its	binding	to	an	allergen	and	
quantitation	by	subsequent	uptake	of	labeled	anti-IgE.	As	compared	to	
the	skin	test,	the	assay	of	specific	IgE	in	serum	is	less	sensitive	but	has	
high	specificity.

TREATMENT
Allergic Rhinitis

Although	 allergen	 avoidance	 is	 the	 most	 cost-effective	 means	 of	
managing	 allergic	 rhinitis,	 only	 in	 the	 case	 of	 animal	 dander	 and	
possibly	 dust	 mites	 is	 it	 feasible.	 Treatment	 with	 pharmacologic	
agents	 represents	 the	 standard	 initial	 approach	 to	 seasonal	 or	
perennial	allergic	rhinitis.	Oral	long-acting	H1	antihistamines,	such	
as	 fexofenadine,	 loratadine,	 desloratadine,	 cetirizine,	 and	 levoce-
tirizine,	 are	 effective	 for	 nasopharyngeal	 itching,	 sneezing,	 and	
watery	 rhinorrhea	 and	 for	 such	 ocular	 manifestations	 as	 itching,	
tearing,	 and	 erythema,	 but	 they	 are	 less	 efficacious	 for	 the	 nasal	
congestion.	They	reduce	nasal	and	ocular	symptoms	by	about	one-
third.	These	antihistamines	are	less	lipophilic	and	more	H1	selec-
tive,	thus	minimizing	their	ability	to	cross	the	blood-brain	barrier	
and	therefore	diminishing	their	sedating	and	anticholinergic	effect;	
they	do	not	differ	appreciably	in	efficacy	for	relief	of	rhinitis	and/or		
sneezing.

Intranasal	 high-potency	 glucocorticoids	 are	 the	 most	 effective	
drugs	 available	 for	 the	 relief	 of	 established	 rhinitis,	 seasonal	 or	
perennial,	and	are	effective	in	relieving	nasal	congestion	as	well	as	
ocular	symptoms.	They	provide	efficacy	with	substantially	reduced	
side	effects	as	compared	with	this	same	class	of	agent	administered	
orally.	Their	most	frequent	side	effect	is	local	irritation,	with	fungal	
overgrowth	being	a	rare	occurrence.	The	currently	available	intra-
nasal	glucocorticoids—beclomethasone,	flunisolide,	triamcinolone,	
budesonide,	fluticasone	propionate,	fluticasone	furoate,	ciclesonide,	
and	mometasone	furoate—are	equally	effective	for	nasal	symptom	
relief,	including	nasal	congestion;	these	agents	all	achieve	up	to	70%	
overall	symptom	relief	with	some	variation	in	the	time	period	for	
onset	 of	 benefit.	 The	 nasal	 antihistamines	 azelastine	 and	 olopata-
dine	 may	 benefit	 individuals	 with	 nonallergic	 vasomotor	 rhinitis	
as	 well	 as	 have	 additive	 benefit	 to	 intranasal	 steroids	 in	 allergic	
rhinitis,	 but	 they	 have	 an	 adverse	 effect	 of	 dysgeusia	 (taste	 per-
version)	in	some	patients.	Alternative	nasal	decongestants	include		
α-adrenergic	agents	such	as	phenylephrine	or	oxymetazoline;	how-
ever,	 the	 duration	 of	 their	 efficacy	 is	 limited	 because	 of	 rebound	
rhinitis	(i.e.,	7-	to	14-day	use	can	lead	to	rhinitis	medicamentosa)	
and	 such	 systemic	 responses	 as	 hypertension.	 Oral	 α-adrenergic	
agonist	 decongestants	 containing	 pseudoephedrine	 can	 improve	
management	 of	 nasal	 congestion,	 generally	 in	 combination	 with	
an	 antihistamine.	 These	 pseudoephedrine	 combination	 products	
can	 cause	 insomnia	 and	 are	 precluded	 from	 use	 in	 patients	 with	
narrow-angle	 glaucoma,	 urinary	 retention,	 severe	 hypertension,	
marked	 coronary	 artery	 disease,	 or	 a	 first-trimester	 pregnancy.	
The	 CysLT1	 antagonist	 montelukast	 is	 approved	 for	 treatment	 of	
both	 seasonal	 and	 perennial	 rhinitis.	 However,	 it	 is	 less	 effective	
than	 H1	 antihistamines	 and	 nasal	 glucocorticoids,	 and	 reports	 of	
neuropsychiatric	events	have	led	to	increased	U.S.	Food	and	Drug	
Administration	precautions.	Cromolyn	sodium	nasal	spray	inhib-
its	 mast	 cell	 degranulation	 and	 can	 be	 used	 prophylactically	 on	 a	
continuous	 basis	 during	 the	 season	 or	 as	 needed	 before	 a	 known	
exposure.	Topical	ipratropium	is	an	anticholinergic	agent	effective	
in	 reducing	 rhinorrhea,	 including	 that	 of	 patients	 with	 perennial	
nonallergic	symptoms,	and	it	can	be	additionally	efficacious	when	
combined	with	intranasal	glucocorticoids.	For	concomitant	allergic	

conjunctivitis,	topical	treatment	with	cromolyn	sodium	is	effective	
in	treating	mild	allergic	symptoms,	and	topical	antihistamines	such	
as	olopatadine,	azelastine,	ketotifen,	or	epinastine	administered	to	
the	 eye	 provide	 rapid	 relief	 of	 itching	 and	 redness	 and	 are	 more	
effective	than	oral	antihistamines.	

Immunotherapy 
Immunotherapy	 consists	 of	 repeated	 exposure	
to	the	allergen(s)	considered	to	be	specifically	responsible	for	the	
symptom	 complex.	 Two	 forms	 of	 immunotherapy,	 subcutaneous	
(SCIT)	and	sublingual	(SLIT),	are	currently	available.	Randomized,	
controlled	 studies	 of	 ragweed,	 grass,	 dust	 mite,	 and	 cat	 dander	
allergens	 administered	 via	 SCIT	 for	 treatment	 of	 allergic	 rhinitis	
have	 demonstrated	 significant	 improved	 symptom	 control	 over	
medications	alone	with	the	advantage	of	providing	a	durable	ben-
efit,	 as	 well	 as	 a	 reduction	 in	 asthma	 symptoms,	 medication	 use,	
and	 bronchial	 hyperreacticity	 in	 allergic	 asthma.	 Clinical	 practice	
guidelines	recommend	a	duration	of	SCIT	is	3–5	years,	with	discon-
tinuation	being	based	on	minimal	symptoms	over	two	consecutive	
seasons	of	exposure	to	the	allergen.	Clinical	benefit	appears	related	
to	the	administration	of	a	high	dose	of	relevant	allergen,	gradually	
uptitrating	 concentration	 and	 advancing	 from	 weekly	 to	 monthly	
intervals.	SCIT	injections	occur	in	a	licensed	treatment	site;	2–3%	
of	SCIT	patients	experience	a	systemic	reaction,	including	anaph-
ylaxis,	 over	 a	 12-month	 period.	 The	 majority	 of	 these	 reactions	
occur	soon	after	injection,	and	thus,	patients	should	remain	at	the	
treatment	 site	 for	 at	 least	 30	 min	 after	 allergen	 administration	 so	
that	any	systemic	reactions	can	be	managed.	Local	reactions	with	
erythema	and	 induration	are	 not	 uncommon	and	 may	 persist	for	
1–3	 days.	 SLIT	 is	 prepared	 as	 a	 tablet	 to	 be	 dissolved	 under	 the	
tongue	at	home	after	the	first	dose.	The	efficacy	of	SLIT	is	compa-
rable	to	SCIT	but	only	for	the	three	allergen	formulations	currently	
available:	dust	mite,	timothy/northern	grasses,	and	short	ragweed.	
Systemic	 reactions	 are	 less	 frequent	 with	 SLIT,	 but	 transient	 oral	
pruritus	is	common.	Immunotherapy	is	contraindicated	in	patients	
with	significant	cardiovascular	disease	or	unstable	asthma.	Severe	
cases	 of	 anaphylaxis	 have	 occurred	 after	 allergen	 immunotherapy	
when	 patients	 were	 taking	 a	 β-adrenergic	 blocking	 agent.	 Thus,	
immunotherapy	 should	 be	 conducted	 with	 caution	 in	 any	 patient	
requiring	 β-adrenergic	 blocking	 therapy	 due	 to	 the	 difficulty	 in	
managing	an	anaphylactic	complication.

Immunotherapy	 should	 be	 reserved	 for	 clearly	 documented	
seasonal	 or	 perennial	 rhinitis	 that	 is	 clinically	 related	 to	 defined	
allergen	 exposure	 with	 confirmation	 by	 the	 presence	 of	 allergen-	
specific	 IgE	 through	 skin	 or	 in	 vitro	 specific	 IgE	 testing.	 The	
response	to	immunotherapy	is	associated	with	a	complex	of	cellular	
and	 humoral	 effects	 that	 includes	 a	 modulation	 in	 T	 lymphocyte	
cytokine	production	and	allergen-specific	IgG4	expansion.	Systemic	
treatment	 with	 omalizumab,	 an	 anti-IgE	 monoclonal	 antibody,	 is	
efficacious	for	allergic	rhinitis	and	can	be	used	with	immunother-
apy	 to	 enhance	 safety	 and	 efficacy.	 However,	 current	 approval	 is	
only	 for	 treatment	 of	 patients	 with	 persistent	 allergic	 asthma	 not	
controlled	by	inhaled	glucocorticoid	therapy	or	chronic	idiopathic	
urticaria	not	controlled	by	oral	H1	antihistamines.

A	sequence	for	the	management	of	allergic	or	perennial	rhinitis	
based	on	an	allergen-specific	diagnosis	and	stepwise	management	
as	required	for	symptom	control	would	include	the	following:	(1)	
identification	 of	 the	 offending	 allergen(s)	 by	 history	 with	 confir-
mation	 of	 the	 presence	 of	 allergen-specific	 IgE	 by	 skin	 test	 and/
or	 serum	 assay;	 (2)	 avoidance	 of	 the	 offending	 allergen;	 and	 (3)	
medical	management	in	a	stepwise	fashion	(Fig. 352-4).	Mild	inter-
mittent	symptoms	of	allergic	rhinitis	are	treated	with	oral	antihista-
mines,	oral	CysLT1	receptor	antagonists,	intranasal	antihistamines,	
or	intranasal	cromolyn.	Moderate	to	more	severe	allergic	rhinitis	is	
managed	with	intranasal	glucocorticoids	plus	oral	antihistamines,	
oral	 CysLT1	 receptor	 antagonists,	 or	 antihistamine-decongestant	
combinations.	Persistent	or	seasonal	allergic	rhinitis,	rhinoconjunc-
tivitis,	or	asthma	that	remains	uncontrolled	with	maximal	medical	
therapy	merit	consideration	of	allergen-specific	immunotherapy.

353 Anaphylaxis

David Hong, Joshua A. Boyce

 ■ BACKGROUND
Anaphylaxis	is	a	potentially	life-threatening	systemic	allergic	reaction	
involving	one	or	more	organ	systems	that	typically	occurs	within	sec-
onds	 to	 minutes	 of	 exposure	 to	 the	 anaphylactic	 trigger,	 most	 often	
a	 drug,	 food,	 or	 Hymenoptera	 sting.	 The	 term	 anaphylaxis	 was	 first	
described	in	1902	by	Charles	Richet	and	Paul	Portier	who	attempted	
to	immunize	dogs	against	sea	anemone	toxin	in	the	same	way	Pasteur	
was	able	to	vaccinate	individuals	against	the	smallpox	virus.	To	their	
surprise,	repeated	administration	of	small,	sublethal	doses	of	sea	anem-
one	 toxin	 reliably	 induced	 acute-onset	 death	 when	 readministered		
2–3	weeks	after	initial	“vaccination”	to	the	toxin.	The	phenomenon	was	
termed	 ana	 (anti)-phylaxis	 (“protection	 or	 guarding”)	 because	 vacci-
nation	with	anemone	toxin	resulted	in	the	opposite	intended	immune	
effect.	 Charles	 Richet	 was	 awarded	 the	 Nobel	 Prize	 in	 Physiology	 or	
Medicine	 in	 1913	 for	 this	 work,	 which	 led	 to	 further	 insights	 into	
hypersensitivity	and	mast	cell	biology.
 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
While	80–90%	of	anaphylactic	episodes	are	uniphasic,	about	10–20%	
of	cases	are	biphasic,	in	which	anaphylactic	symptoms	return	about	an	
hour	or	longer	after	resolution	of	initial	symptoms.	Anaphylactic	reac-
tions	are	particularly	dangerous	when	hypotension	or	hypoxia	occurs,	
leading	 potentially	 to	 cardiovascular	 collapse	 or	 respiratory	 failure,	
respectively.	 There	 may	 be	 upper	 or	 lower	 airway	 obstruction	 or	
both.	Laryngeal	edema	may	be	experienced	as	a	“lump”	in	the	throat,	
hoarseness,	or	stridor,	whereas	bronchial	obstruction	is	associated	with	
a	 feeling	 of	 tightness	 in	 the	 chest	 and/or	 audible	 wheezing.	 Patients	
with	underlying	asthma	are	predisposed	to	severe	involvement	of	the	
lower	airways	and	increased	mortality	associated	with	anaphylaxis.	In	
fatal	cases	with	clinical	bronchial	obstruction,	the	lungs	show	marked	
hyperinflation	 on	 gross	 and	 microscopic	 examination.	 The	 micro-
scopic	findings	in	the	bronchi,	however,	are	limited	to	luminal	secre-
tions,	peribronchial	congestion,	submucosal	edema,	and	eosinophilic	
infiltration,	and	the	acute	emphysema	is	attributed	to	intractable	bron-
chospasm	that	subsides	with	death.	Angioedema	resulting	in	death	by	
mechanical	 obstruction	 occurs	 in	 the	 epiglottis	 and	 larynx;	 however,	
the	 process	 also	 is	 evident	 in	 the	 hypopharynx	 and	 to	 some	 extent		
in	the	trachea.	On	microscopic	examination,	there	is	wide	separation	

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Many	of	the	important	early	mediators	of	anaphylaxis	are	derived	from	
mast	 cells,	 basophils,	 and	 eosinophils.	 Mast	 cells	 and	 basophils	 con-
tain	 preformed	 granules	 composed	 of	 histamine,	 proteases	 (tryptase,	
chymase),	 proteoglycans	 (heparin,	 chondroitin	 sulfate),	 and	 tumor	
necrosis	 factor-α,	 which	 are	 rapidly	 released	 into	 surrounding	 tissue	
upon	 cell	 activation,	 a	 process	 known	 as	 degranulation.	 Mast	 cells,	
basophils,	and	eosinophils	are	also	sources	of	arachidonic	acid–derived	
products,	 which	 include	 cysteinyl	 leukotrienes,	 prostaglandins,	 and	
platelet-activating	factor	(PAF).	Histamine	release	results	in	flushing,	
urticaria,	pruritus,	and,	in	high	concentrations,	hypotension	and	tachy-
cardia.	Cysteinyl	leukotrienes	and	prostaglandin	D2	cause	bronchocon-
striction	 and	 increased	 microvascular	 permeability.	 Prostaglandin	 D2	
causes	cutaneous	flushing	and	attracts	eosinophils	and	basophils	to	the	
site	of	mast	cell	activation.	Serum	PAF	levels	correlate	with	anaphylaxis	
severity	and	are	inversely	proportional	to	the	constitutive	level	of	PAF	
acetylhydrolase,	which	is	necessary	for	PAF	inactivation.	Tryptase	and	
chymase	can	activate	complement	and	coagulation	pathways.	Activa-
tion	of	these	pathways	results	in	production	of	the	anaphylotoxins,	C3a	
and	C5a,	and	activation	of	the	kallikrein-kinin	system,	which	regulates	
blood	pressure	and	vascular	permeability.	The	actions	of	these	anaph-
ylactic	mediators	are	likely	additive	or	synergistic	at	the	target	tissues.

 ■ PREDISPOSING FACTORS AND MECHANISMS
Because	 the	 most	 dangerous	 manifestations	 of	 anaphylaxis	 involve	
the	cardiovascular	and/or	respiratory	systems,	preexisting	asthma	and	
underlying	cardiovascular	disease	could	lead	to	more	rapid	decompen-
sation	 from	 anaphylaxis.	 Atopy	 is	 not	 generally	 thought	 to	 be	 a	 risk	
factor	 for	 anaphylaxis	 from	 drug	 reactions	 or	 Hymenoptera	 stings,	
but	 it	 is	 associated	 with	 radiocontrast	 sensitivity,	 exercise-induced	
anaphylaxis,	 idiopathic	 anaphylaxis,	 and	 allergy	 to	 foods	 or	 latex.	
Severe	 Hymenoptera-induced	 anaphylaxis	 (generally	 with	 prominent	
hypotension)	can	be	a	presenting	feature	of	underlying	systemic	mas-
tocytosis.	 Hymenoptera	 allergy	 is	 also	 more	 likely	 in	 patients	 whose	
occupations	 (i.e.,	 beekeepers,	 trash	 haulers,	 and	 landscape	 workers)	
place	them	in	regular	proximity	to	stinging	insects.	Most	commonly,	
allergen-induced	cross-linking	of	IgE-bound	FcεRI	receptors	on	mast	
cells	and	basophils	initiates	the	signal	transduction	events	leading	to	
hypersensitivity	syndromes,	including	anaphylaxis.	The	generation	of	
allergen-specific	IgE	is	the	end	result	of	sensitization	via	the	adaptive	
immune	 system.	 While	 the	 mechanisms	 underlying	 sensitization	
are	 beyond	 the	 scope	 of	 this	 chapter,	 environmental	 factors,	 innate	
immune	 responses,	 and	 cytokines	 are	 among	 the	 many	 variables	
leading	to	antigen-specific	IgE	production	by	B	cells	and	plasma	cells.	
IgE-mediated	 drug	 allergies	 are	 most	 common	 with	 antibiotics	 and	
certain	chemotherapy	drugs,	though	theoretically,	they	can	occur	with	
almost	 any	 medication.	 As	 is	 the	 case	 with	 environmental	 allergies,	
repeated	exposure	to	the	allergy-causing	antigen	is	an	important	risk	
factor	to	keep	in	mind	when	evaluating	patients	with	anaphylaxis.	In

2728 the	 case	 of	 allergy	 to	 carboplatin,	 the	 incidence	 of	 hypersensitivity	 is	
27%	in	patients	who	have	had	≥7	lifetime	infusions	and	as	high	as	46%	
in	patients	who	have	had	≥15	lifetime	infusions.	Similarly,	patients	with	
cystic	fibrosis	have	a	relatively	high	incidence	of	allergic	reactions	to	IV	
antibiotics	 that	 they	 receive	 periodically	 for	 intermittent	 “clean-outs”	
to	maintain	airway	clearance.	Drugs	can	also	function	as	haptens	that	
form	 immunogenic	 conjugates	 with	 host	 proteins.	 The	 conjugating	
hapten	 may	 be	 the	 parent	 compound,	 a	 nonenzymatically	 derived	
storage	 product,	 or	 a	 metabolite	 formed	 in	 the	 host.	 Recombinant	
biologics	can	also	induce	the	formation	of	IgE	against	the	proteins	or	
against	glycosylated	structures	that	serve	as	immunogens.	Outbreaks	of	
anaphylaxis	to	the	epidermal	growth	factor	receptor	(EGFR)	antibody	
cetuximab	 have	 been	 reported	 in	 association	 with	 elevated	 titers	 of	
serum	IgE	to	alpha-1,3-galactose	(alpha-gal),	an	oligosaccharide	found	
in	nonprimate	mammals.	Cetuximab	is	derived	from	a	mouse	cell	line	
expressing	 a	 transferase	 that	 tags	 the	 Fab′	 portion	 of	 the	 cetuximab	
heavy	 chain	 with	 alpha-gal.	 Interestingly,	 patients	 with	 a	 history	 of	
multiple	 bites	 from	 Amblyomma  americanum	 ticks	 commonly	 found	
in	the	Carolinas,	Arkansas,	and	Tennessee	are	more	likely	to	have	anti-	
alpha-gal	 IgE	 as	 compared	 with	 control	 patients	 living	 outside	 those	
states.	Some	individuals	who	become	sensitized	to	alpha-gal	can	develop	
episodes	of	delayed-onset	anaphylaxis	to	meat	from	beef,	lamb,	and	pork.
Non-IgE-mediated	mast	cell	activation	secondary	to	certain	drugs	
is	clinically	indistinguishable	from	classical	IgE-mediated	hypersensi-
tivity	reactions,	but	it	can	occur	with	first	known	exposure	since	there	
is	 no	 prior	 need	 for	 mast	 cell	 sensitization	 by	 IgE.	 MRGPRX2,	 a	 G	
protein–coupled	 receptor	 that	 is	 highly	 expressed	 in	 skin	 mast	 cells,	
has	 been	 shown	 in	 mouse	 models	 and	 in	 vitro	 studies	 using	 human	
cells	to	induce	mast	cell	activation	and	mediator	release	secondary	to	
neuromuscular	 blocking	 drugs	 (NMBDs),	 quinolones,	 and	 icatibant.	
These	findings	are	clinically	significant	since	NMBDs	are	a	relatively	
common	 cause	 of	 perioperative	 anaphylaxis	 and	 in	 other	 settings	
requiring	 endotracheal	 intubation	 and	 quinolones	 are	 a	 commonly	
used	 antibiotic	 family.	 Icatibant,	 a	 bradykinin-2	 receptor	 antagonist	
administered	 by	 subcutaneous	 injection	 for	 the	 treatment	 of	 acute	
attacks	 of	 hereditary	 angioedema,	 is	 known	 to	 frequently	 result	 in	
local	 injection	 site	 reactions.	 Another	 example	 of	 non-IgE-mediated	
anaphylaxis	 is	 demonstrated	 with	 paclitaxel,	 a	 chemotherapy	 agent	
most	commonly	used	in	combination	with	carboplatin	to	treat	ovarian	
cancer.	It	is	derived	from	yew	tree	bark	and	needles	that	require	poly-
ethoxylated	castor	oil	(Cremophor)	to	be	solubilized	into	aqueous	solu-
tion.	Cremophor	has	been	shown	in	vitro	to	activate	the	complement	
cascade,	 resulting	 in	 complement-dependent	 histamine	 release	 from	
mast	cells	and	basophils.	A	version	of	paclitaxel	that	is	solubilized	by	
being	bound	to	albumin	nanoparticles,	Abraxane,	has	a	far	lower	rate	
of	hypersensitivity,	especially	for	patients	who	have	had	infusion	reac-
tions	to	Cremophor-solubilized	paclitaxel.	Reactions	to	radiocontrast	
and	vancomycin	are	other	examples	of	non-IgE-mediated	hypersensi-
tivity.	Opiates	and	nonsteroidal	anti-inflammatory	drugs	(NSAIDs)	are	
other	drug	categories	that	can	have	similar	adverse	reactions.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	diagnosis	of	an	anaphylactic	reaction	depends	primarily	on	a	his-
tory	revealing	the	onset	of	symptoms	and	signs	within	seconds	to	min-
utes	after	the	putative	trigger	is	encountered.	An	exception	is	delayed	
anaphylaxis	to	meats	in	alpha-gal–sensitized	patients.	Every	attempt	to	
identify	the	specific	cause	or	causes	should	be	made	to	minimize	the	
risk	of	recurrent	anaphylaxis.	If	a	particular	drug	or	food	is	suspected,	
skin	 or	 serum-specific	 IgE	 testing	 can	 be	 useful	 to	 confirm	 clinical	
suspicions.	If	a	specific	trigger	cannot	be	identified	by	history	or	test-
ing,	a	workup	of	underlying	baseline	atopic	diatheses	may	be	useful	to	
identify	risk	factors	that	could	play	a	potential	contributory	role.	In	the	
acute	setting,	laboratory	biomarkers	of	mast	cell	degranulation	may	be	
useful	to	document	the	severity	of	an	anaphylactic	episode.	The	most	
obvious	serum	biomarker	to	assay,	histamine,	has	an	extremely	short	
half-life	 with	 a	 measurable	 time-window	 that	 expires	 <1	 h	 from	 the	
onset	of	anaphylaxis.	A	more	practical	and	useful	biomarker	is	serum	
tryptase,	 which	 peaks	 60–90	 min	 after	 the	 onset	 of	 anaphylaxis	 and	

can	be	measured	as	long	as	5	h	after	the	onset	of	anaphylaxis.	It	may	be	
useful	to	follow-up	an	elevated	tryptase	measurement	in	the	acute	set-
ting	with	another	measurement	when	the	patient	is	clinically	stable	to	
establish	a	baseline	reference.	An	elevated	baseline	tryptase	level	may	
warrant	 further	 workup	 for	 mastocytosis,	 especially	 if	 the	 presenting	
reaction	occurred	in	the	setting	of	Hymenoptera	sting.

 ■ TREATMENT
Early	recognition	of	an	anaphylactic	reaction	and	appropriate	interven-
tion	are	critically	important	because	severe,	even	fatal,	complications	
can	occur	within	minutes	after	symptoms	first	appear.	The	treatment	
of	first	choice	is	intramuscular	administration	of	0.3–0.5	mL	of	1:1000	
(1	mg/mL)	epinephrine,	with	repeated	doses	at	5-	to	20-min	intervals	
as	needed	for	a	severe	reaction.	The	failure	to	use	epinephrine	within	
the	first	20	min	of	symptoms	is	a	risk	factor	for	poor	clinical	outcomes	
in	various	studies	of	anaphylaxis.	Another	important	variable	that	may	
affect	 anaphylaxis	 survival	 is	 body	 posture,	 as	 an	 upright	 or	 sitting	
posture	 may	 lead	 to	 “empty	 ventricle	 syndrome”	 in	 which	 there	 is	
insufficient	venous	return	to	the	heart	from	sudden-onset	hypotension	
secondary	to	intravascular	volume	depletion.	Epinephrine	can	further	
accelerate	 empty	 ventricle	 syndrome	 due	 to	 its	 chronotropic	 effects.	
For	this	reason,	it	is	recommended	that	patients	who	suffer	from	ana-
phylaxis	be	placed	in	the	supine	position	before	receiving	epinephrine.	
IV	 fluids	 and	 vasopressor	 agents	 may	 be	 administered	 in	 the	 acute	
medical	 setting	 if	 intractable	 hypotension	 occurs.	 Epinephrine	 pro-
vides	 both	 α-	 and	 β-adrenergic	 effects,	 resulting	 in	 vasoconstriction,	
bronchial	 smooth-muscle	 relaxation,	 and	 attenuation	 of	 enhanced	
venular	permeability.	Beta	blockers	may	attenuate	this	response;	there-
fore,	an	alternative	antihypertensive	may	be	considered	in	patients	at	
high	risk	of	needing	emergency	epinephrine.	Oxygen	alone	via	a	nasal	
catheter	 or	 with	 nebulized	 albuterol	 may	 be	 helpful;	 however,	 either	
endotracheal	 intubation	 or	 a	 tracheostomy	 is	 mandatory	 for	 oxygen	
delivery	 if	 progressive	 hypoxia	 develops.	 Ancillary	 agents	 such	 as	
antihistamines,	 glucocorticoids,	 and	 bronchodilators	 are	 also	 useful	
therapeutics	to	treat	urticaria/angioedema	and	bronchospasm	once	the	
patient	is	hemodynamically	stable.

 ■ PREVENTION
Avoidance  The	 simplest,	 most	 straightforward	 approach	 to	 the	
long-term	 management	 of	 a	 patient	 with	 a	 history	 of	 anaphylaxis	 is	
strict	avoidance	of	known	anaphylactic	triggers	and	education	on	acute	
management,	 specifically,	 instructing	 the	 patient	 on	 proper	 use	 and	
indications	 for	 use	 of	 self-administered	 epinephrine.	 Lifelong	 avoid-
ance	is	not	easy	if	the	trigger	is	an	occupational	exposure,	Hymenoptera	
sting,	a	common	food	(i.e.,	peanut),	or	a	drug	representing	the	sole	or	
best	 therapeutic	 option	 for	 the	 patient.	 Special	 management	 options	
may	exist	for	these	patients.

Venom Immunotherapy  Patients	with	only	large	local	reactions	
to	 Hymenoptera	 stings	 are	 unlikely	 to	 have	 anaphylaxis	 with	 subse-
quent	stings.	However,	patients	of	any	age	who	have	had	documented	
anaphylaxis	 should	 be	 formally	 evaluated	 and	 started	 on	 venom	
immunotherapy	 (VIT)	 if	 skin	 or	 serologic	 IgE	 testing	 confirms	 the	
history.	Immunotherapy	is	a	means	of	“tolerizing”	patients	to	allergen	
by	means	of	serial	subcutaneous	administration	of	escalating	doses	of	
extract	containing	relevant	allergen	until	a	target	maintenance	dose	is	
achieved.	As	in	the	case	of	Richet’s	unfortunate	dogs,	anaphylaxis	can	
sometimes	occur	during	the	course	of	administering	immunotherapy	
extracts,	 so	 formulating	 extracts	 and	 administering	 them	 is	 typically	
done	under	the	care	of	a	specialist	familiar	with	this	type	of	treatment.	
In	 the	 case	 of	 Hymenoptera	 allergy,	 patients	 receive	 VIT	 extracts	
containing	 actual	 Hymenoptera	 venom	 with	 a	 maintenance	 dose	
equivalent	to	2–5	stings.	The	recommended	duration	of	treatment	is		
3–5	years;	however,	some	patients	who	have	experienced	severe	respi-
ratory	or	cardiovascular	anaphylaxis	are	put	on	lifelong	therapy.

Preventative  Tolerance  Induction 
IgE	 sensitization	 to	 foods	
occurs	most	frequently	in	infants	and	young	children,	especially	those

with	 atopic	 dermatitis,	 and	 is	 a	 risk	 factor	 for	 anaphylaxis	 (although	
detection	of	specific	IgE	through	skin	or	serum	testing	has	relatively	
poor	 predictive	 value).	 While	 most	 allergy	 to	 egg,	 milk,	 soy,	 and/or	
wheat	resolves	spontaneously	during	childhood,	~80%	of	children	with	
peanut	allergy	remain	sensitive	for	life.	A	sharp	rise	in	the	prevalence	
of	 peanut	 allergy	 was	 also	 observed	 in	 the	 late	 1990s	 to	 early	 2000s,	
especially	 in	 countries	 with	 Western	 diets	 where	 the	 average	 age	 of	
peanut	introduction	was	age	≥3	years.	Curiously,	in	cultures	where	pea-
nut	 was	 introduced	 much	 earlier	 into	 children’s	 diets,	 the	 prevalence	
of	peanut	allergy	remained	low.	The	landmark	Learning	Early	About	
Peanut	 Allergy	 (LEAP)	 study	 demonstrated	 that	 early	 introduction	
of	peanut	protein	to	the	diet	of	high-risk	infants	(4–11	months	of	age	
with	atopic	dermatitis	and/or	egg	allergy)	prevented	the	development	
of	 most	 (80%	 or	 more)	 peanut	 allergy	 compared	 with	 children	 who	
did	 not	 consume	 peanuts	 (avoidance	 group),	 even	 when	 IgE	 sensiti-
zation	(based	on	positive	skin	test)	had	already	developed	at	the	time	
of	study	entry.	While	the	induction	of	tolerance	at	an	early	age	seems	
to	be	key	to	preventing	clinical	reactivity	later	in	life,	it	is	not	yet	clear	
if	this	principle	holds	true	for	other	foods	commonly	associated	with	
hypersensitivity	reactions.

Desensitization  For	 patients	 who	 have	 experienced	 anaphylaxis	
from	drug	allergy	and	whose	treatment	regimen	requires	the	admin-
istration	 of	 the	 offending	 drug,	 desensitization	 may	 be	 a	 short-term	
treatment	 option	 to	 prevent	 reactions.	 Desensitization	 elicits	 a	 tem-
porary	 state	 of	 tolerance	 to	 the	 drug	 in	 sensitized,	 clinically	 reactive	
patients.	 While	 it	 has	 been	 a	 proven	 technique	 for	 penicillin-allergic	
patients	for	decades,	desensitization	has	more	recently	been	proven	to	
be	 effective	 for	 certain	 chemotherapy	 agents,	 especially	 platin-based	
chemotherapy	agents	that	can	induce	IgE-mediated	sensitization	with	
repeated	exposures.	The	exact	mechanisms	underlying	desensitization	
are	not	fully	understood;	however,	temporary	tolerance	can	be	achieved	
through	the	serial	administration	of	gradually	escalating	doses	of	drug,	
starting	from	extremely	low	doses,	over	the	course	of	hours.	So	long	as	
the	patient	continues	to	receive	the	drug	in	question	at	regular	inter-
vals	 based	 on	 drug	 half-life,	 a	 “desensitized”	 state	 can	 also	 be	 main-
tained	until	the	drug	is	no	longer	needed.	While	drug	desensitization	
certainly	works	for	IgE-mediated	reactions,	it	has	been	performed	in	
cases	 of	 non-IgE-mediated	 anaphylaxis	 from	 Cremophor-solubilized	
paclitaxel	 as	 described	 earlier	 in	 this	 chapter.	 Desensitization	 has	
also	 been	 shown	 by	 multiple	 groups	 to	 prevent	 non-IgE-mediated	
reactions	 from	 a	 variety	 of	 biologic	 agents,	 various	 chemotherapy	
drugs,	and	NSAIDs.	Given	the	complexity	and	variety	of	possible	drug	
reactions,	 the	 decision	 to	 desensitize,	 challenge,	 or	 avoid	 should	 be	
made	in	conjunction	with	an	allergy	specialist	for	complete	evaluation	
and	 proper	 risk	 stratification	 of	 the	 different	 possible	 approaches	 to		
take.

354 Mastocytosis

Matthew P. Giannetti, Joshua A. Boyce

 ■ DEFINITION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Mastocytosis	 is	 defined	 by	 accumulation	 of	 clonally	 expanded	 mast	
cells	in	tissues	such	as	skin,	bone	marrow,	liver,	spleen,	and	gut.	Diag-
nostically,	mast	cell	expansion	is	most	readily	identified	in	skin	and/or	
bone	marrow.	Mastocytosis	occurs	at	any	age	and	has	a	slight	prepon-
derance	in	males.	The	prevalence	of	mastocytosis	is	estimated	at	~1	in	
10,000	people.	Most	forms	of	the	disease	are	characterized	by	somatic	
gain-of-function	mutations	in	the	stem	cell	factor	receptor	(KIT)	gene.	
Familial	occurrence	is	rare,	and	atopy	is	not	increased	compared	with	
the	general	population.
 ■ CLASSIFICATION AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
A	consensus	classification	for	mastocytosis	recognizes	cutaneous	mas-
tocytosis	with	variants,	five	systemic	forms,	and	the	rarest	variant,	mast	
cell	sarcoma	(Table 354-1).

Cutaneous	 mastocytosis	 is	 the	 most	 common	 diagnosis	 in	 chil-
dren	and	indicates	disease	limited	to	skin	with	absence	of	pathologic	
infiltrates	 in	 internal	 organs.	 It	 is	 usually	 diagnosed	 within	 the	 first	
year	of	life	with	demonstration	of	fixed,	maculopapular,	polymorphic,	
and	 hyperpigmented	 lesions	 (maculopapular	 cutaneous	 mastocytosis	
[MPCM],	formerly	known	as	urticaria	pigmentosa),	mastocytoma(s),	
or	 diffuse	 cutaneous	 mastocytosis.	 Although	 mast	 cell	 accumulation	
is	 limited	 to	 the	 skin,	 children	 often	 have	 systemic	 symptoms.	 Sys-
temic	 mastocytosis	 (SM)	 refers	 to	 involvement	 of	 a	 noncutaneous	
site	 (usually	 bone	 marrow).	 There	 are	 five	 distinct	 variants	 of	 SM.	
Indolent systemic mastocytosis	(ISM)	accounts	for	the	majority	of	adult	
patients.	ISM	is	diagnosed	when	there	is	no	evidence	of	an	associated	
hematologic	disorder,	mast	cell	leukemia,	or	organ	dysfunction	due	to	
mast	cell	infiltration.	ISM	is	associated	with	a	normal	life	expectancy.	
Smoldering systemic mastocytosis	(SSM)	is	characterized	by	high	mast	
cell	burden	as	evidenced	by	a	bone	marrow	infiltration	of	>30%	and	
a	 baseline	 serum	 tryptase	 >200	 ng/mL	 (B	 findings),	 but	 absence	 of	
systemic  mastocytosis  associated  with  clonal  hematologic  non–mast 
cell  lineage  disease	 (SM-AHNMD)	 or	 aggressive  systemic  mastocytosis	
(ASM)	 (Table  354-2).	 In	 SM-AHNMD,	 the	 prognosis	 is	 determined	
by	the	nature	of	the	associated	disorder,	which	can	range	from	dysmy-
elopoiesis	 to	 leukemias	 usually	 of	 myeloid	 origin.	 In	 ASM,	 mast	 cell	
infiltration/proliferation	occurs	in	multiple	organs	such	as	liver,	spleen,	
gut,	bone,	and	bone	marrow	resulting	in	one	or	more	C	findings	and	
a	poor	prognosis	(Table	354-2).	Mast cell leukemia	(MCL)	is	the	rarest	
form	 of	 SM	 and	 is	 invariably	 fatal	 at	 present;	 the	 peripheral	 blood	
contains	 circulating,	 metachromatically	 staining,	 atypical	 mast	 cells.	
An	 aleukemic	 form	 of	 MCL	 is	 recognized	 without	 circulating	 mast	
cells	when	the	percentage	of	high-grade	immature	mast	cells	in	bone

TABLE 354-2  B and C Findings for Diagnosis of SSM and ASM
B Findings (2 or more in the absence of any C findings are required for a 
diagnosis of SSM):
1.  MC infiltration in bone marrow biopsy of >30% and a basal serum tryptase 

level >200 ng/mL

2.  Hypercellular bone marrow with signs of dysmyelopoiesis but without 
cytopenias meeting C criteria or WHO criteria for an MDS or MPN
3.  Palpable hepatomegaly, palpable splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy  

(on CT or ultrasound: >2 cm) without impaired liver function or hypersplenism

C Findings (1 or more required for a diagnosis of ASM). C findings should be 
reasonably attributable to high tissue mast cell infiltration.
1.  Cytopenia(s): ANC <1000/μL or Hb <10 g/dL or PLT <100,000/μL
2.  Hepatomegaly with ascites and impaired liver function
3.  Palpable splenomegaly with associated hypersplenism
4.  Malabsorption with hypoalbuminemia and weight loss
5.  Skeletal lesions: large area(s) of osteolysis with pathologic fractures 

(presence of osteoporosis alone without osteolytic lesions does not satisfy 
this criterion)

marrow	smears	exceeds	20%	in	a	nonspicular	area.	Mast	cell	sarcoma	is	
a	rare	solid	mast	cell	tumor	with	malignant	invasive	features.

Somatic	activating	mutations	in	the	KIT	gene	are	characteristic	of	
mastocytosis.	KIT	D816V	is	most	commonly	observed,	although	other	
mutations	have	been	reported.	KIT	mutations	are	found	in	mast	cells	
and	sometimes	in	multiple	other	cell	lineages	in	patients	with	masto-
cytosis.	KIT	mutations	are	observed	in	patients	with	all	forms	of	SM	
but	are	also	present	in	some	children	with	cutaneous	mastocytosis	in	
lesional	 skin,	 as	 might	 be	 anticipated	 because	 mast	 cells	 are	 of	 bone	
marrow	lineage.	Additional	mutations	in	genes	such	as	TET2, SRSF2, 
ASLX1,	 and	 RUNX1	 known	 to	 be	 associated	 with	 other	 hematologic	
neoplastic	disorders	can	be	detected	in	patients,	usually	with	advanced	
(non-ISM)	 forms	 of	 SM.	 The	 prognosis	 for	 patients	 with	 cutaneous	
mastocytosis	 and	 for	 almost	 all	 patients	 with	 ISM	 is	 a	 normal	 life	
expectancy,	 whereas	 that	 for	 patients	 with	 SM-AHNMD	 is	 deter-
mined	by	the	non–mast	cell	component.	ASM	and	MCL	have	a	poor	
prognosis,	 while	 patients	 with	 SSM	 have	 an	 intermediate	 prognosis.	
Progression	from	ISM	to	a	more	advanced	form	is	rare	(~5%	overall);	
however,	patients	should	be	monitored	for	emergence	of	hematologic	
disease	and	end-organ	manifestations	of	ASM.	In	infants	and	children	
with	 cutaneous	 manifestations,	 namely,	 maculopapular	 cutaneous	
mastocytosis,	mastocytoma(s),	or	bullous	lesions,	visceral	involvement	
is	 usually	 lacking,	 and	 spontaneous	 resolution	 is	 common	 prior	 to	
adolescence.	Polymorphic	maculopapular	cutaneous	mastocytosis	usu-
ally	resolves	spontaneously.	Progression	from	cutaneous	mastocytosis	
(CM)	to	ISM	may	occur	in	~10%	of	children,	especially	in	those	with	
high	mast	cell	burden	(diffuse	cutaneous	mastocytosis)	or	hematologic	
abnormalities	and	those	who	present	with	smaller	uniform	lesions	with	
diameters	measuring	<2	cm	(monomorphic	cutaneous	mastocytosis).
 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The	 clinical	 manifestations	 of	 SM	 are	 due	 to	 the	 release	 of	 bioactive	
substances	 acting	 at	 both	 local	 and	 distal	 sites,	 tissue	 infiltration	 by	
mast	cells,	and	the	tissue	response	to	the	cellular	infiltrate.	The	phar-
macologically	induced	manifestations	are	intermittent	flushing,	tachy-
cardia	and	vascular	collapse,	gastric	distress,	crampy	lower	abdominal	
pain,	 and	 diarrhea.	 The	 increased	 local	 mast	 cell	 burden	 in	 the	 skin	
(MPCM),	 bone	 marrow,	 and	 gastrointestinal	 tract	 may	 be	 a	 direct	
cause	 of	 pruritus,	 bone	 pain,	 and	 malabsorption,	 respectively.	 Mast	
cell–mediated	 fibrotic	 changes	 may	 occur	 in	 liver,	 spleen,	 and	 bone	
marrow	but	not	in	gastrointestinal	tissue	or	skin.

The	cutaneous	lesions	of	MPCM	are	reddish-brown	macules,	pap-
ules,	or	plaques	that	respond	to	trauma	with	urtication	and	erythema	
(Darier’s	 sign).	 Two	 distinct	 forms	 of	 MPCM	 are	 recognized:	 poly-
morphic	MPCM	and	monomorphic	MPCM.	Children	with	CM	may	
present	with	MPCM,	mastocytomas,	or	diffuse	cutaneous	mastocytosis	

(DCM).	Mastocytomas	are	generally	solitary	elevated	lesions	that	are	
yellow,	brown,	or	red	in	color.	Their	size	may	vary	from	a	few	millime-
ters	to	several	centimeters.	Rubbing	or	irritation	of	the	mastocytoma	
lesion	may	lead	to	systemic	symptoms	such	as	flushing	and	urticaria.	
Children	 with	 DCM	 present	 without	 distinct	 lesions,	 but	 rather	 a	
generalized	 thickening	 of	 skin	 and	 “peau	 d’orange”	 appearance	 due	
to	 diffuse	 mast	 cell	 infiltration.	 DCM	 may	 be	 associated	 with	 bullae	
formation	 and	 more	 severe	 systemic	 symptoms,	 including	 upper	
gastrointestinal	 irritation	 and	 vascular	 collapse	 in	 the	 first	 few	 years	
of	life.	Maculopapular	skin	lesions	of	mastocytosis	may	be	present	in	
patients	with	adult-onset	systemic	disease.	The	apparent	incidence	of	
cutaneous	lesions	is	≥80%	in	patients	with	ISM	and	<50%	in	those	with	
SM-AHNMD	or	ASM.	In	the	upper	gastrointestinal	tract,	gastritis	and	
peptic	ulcer	are	significant	problems.	In	the	lower	intestinal	tract,	the	
occurrence	of	diarrhea	and	abdominal	pain	is	attributed	to	increased	
motility	 due	 to	 mast	 cell	 mediators;	 this	 problem	 can	 be	 aggravated	
by	malabsorption,	which	can	also	cause	secondary	nutritional	insuffi-
ciency	and	osteomalacia.	The	periportal	fibrosis	associated	with	mast	
cell	infiltration	may	lead	to	portal	hypertension	and	ascites.	In	some	
patients,	anaphylaxis	with	rapid	and	life-threatening	vascular	collapse	
may	occur.	Anaphylaxis	is	most	commonly	induced	by	Hymenoptera	
stings,	 and	 patients	 often	 have	 evidence	 of	 venom-specific	 IgE.	 The	
neuropsychiatric	disturbances	are	clinically	most	evident	as	impaired	
recent	 memory,	 decreased	 attention	 span,	 and	 “migraine-like”	 head-
aches.	Patients	may	experience	exacerbation	of	a	specific	clinical	sign	
or	 symptom	 variably	 with	 alcohol	 ingestion,	 temperature	 changes,	
stress,	use	of	mast	cell–interactive	opioids,	or	ingestion	of	nonsteroidal	
anti-inflammatory	drugs	(NSAIDs).
 ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Cutaneous	 mastocytosis	 is	 diagnosed	 by	 observing	 the	 characteristic	
lesions	 of	 MPCM	 or	 mastocytoma(s).	 A	 skin	 biopsy	 may	 be	 obtained	
to	 confirm	 these	 subvariants	 of	 CM,	 whereas	 patients	 with	 suspected	
DCM	 and	 bullous	 mastocytosis	 require	 a	 skin	 biopsy	 to	 confirm	 the	
diagnosis.	 Although	 the	 diagnosis	 of	 SM	 is	 generally	 suspected	 based	
on	 clinical	 history,	 physical	 examination	 findings,	 and	 laboratory	 pro-
cedures,	it	can	only	be	confirmed	with	a	tissue	diagnosis.	The	diagnosis	
of	 SM	 necessitates	 a	 bone	 marrow	 biopsy	 to	 meet	 the	 criteria	 of	 one	
major	plus	one	minor	or	three	minor	findings	(Table 354-3).	The	major	
criterion	 requires	 mast	 cell	 aggregates,	 often	 in	 paratrabecular	 and	
perivascular	 locations	 with	 associated	 lymphocytes	 and	 eosinophils.	
Minor	 criteria	 include	 abnormal	 “spindled”	 mast	 cell	 morphology,	
aberrant	mast	cell	membrane	immunophenotype	(CD25	and/or	CD2),	
or	a	codon	816	mutation	in	an	extracutaneous	tissue.	A	basal	serum	
total	tryptase	level	is	a	noninvasive	approach	to	consider	before	bone	
marrow	biopsy.	The	pro-β	and	α	forms	of	tryptase	are	elevated	in	more	
than	one-half	of	patients	with	SM	and	provide	a	minor	criterion;	the	
fully	processed	(“mature”)	β	form	is	increased	in	patients	undergoing	
an	 anaphylactic	 reaction.	 A	 rare	 histopathologic	 subvariant	 called	
well-differentiated  systemic  mastocytosis	 (WDSM)	 is	 characterized	 by	
clusters	 of	 mature-appearing,	 fully	 granulated	 and	 round	 mast	 cells,	
lack	 of	 aberrant	 CD25	 and	 CD2	 expression,	 and	 lack	 of	 D816V	 KIT	
mutation	 in	 most	 patients.	 These	 patients	 often	 have	 a	 history	 of	

TABLE 354-3  Diagnostic Criteria for Systemic Mastocytosisa
Major:

 Multifocal dense infiltrates of mast cells (>15 mast cells per aggregate) in 
bone marrow or other extracutaneous tissues

Minor:

 Abnormal mast cell morphology (spindle shape, bi- or multilobed or eccentric 
nucleus, hypogranulated cytoplasm)
 Aberrant mast cell surface phenotype with expression of CD25 (IL-2 receptor 
alpha chain) and/or CD2
 Detection of codon 816 mutation in peripheral blood cells, bone marrow cells, 
or an extracutaneous lesional tissue

  Total serum tryptase >20 ng/mL

aDiagnosis requires either the major criterion and one minor criterion or three minor 
criteria.

childhood-onset	 cutaneous	 disease,	 and	 their	 mast	 cells	 may	 display	
aberrant	CD30	expression	and	other	markers	of	clonality	such	as	atyp-
ical	 (non-D816V)	 KIT	 mutations.	 Additional	 studies	 directed	 by	 the	
presentation	include	a	bone	densitometry,	bone	scan,	or	skeletal	sur-
vey;	computed	tomography	scan	or	endoscopy;	and	a	neuropsychiatric	
evaluation.	Osteoporosis	is	increased	in	mastocytosis	and	may	lead	to	
pathologic	fractures.

Some	patients	presenting	with	recurrent	mast	cell	activation	symp-
toms	 (particularly	 anaphylaxis	 with	 hypotensive	 syncope)	 have	 been	
found	to	have	underlying	mastocytosis.	A	subset	of	these	patients	may	
be	 found	 to	 have	 evidence	 of	 a	 clonal	 hematologic	 process	 such	 as	
the	D816V	KIT	mutation	or	aberrant	mast	cells	displaying	CD25,	but	
lack	other	diagnostic	criteria	for	SM.	Such	patients	are	termed	to	have	
monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome.

The	differential	diagnosis	requires	the	exclusion	of	other	disorders.	
A	 24-h	 urine	 assessment	 of	 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic	 acid	 and	 meta-
nephrines	should	exclude	a	carcinoid	tumor	and	pheochromocytoma,	
respectively.	Hereditary	α-tryptasemia	may	be	characterized	by	symp-

TREATMENT
Mastocytosis

The	 management	 of	 SM	 is	 symptom	 control	 using	 a	 stepwise	
symptom/sign–directed	approach.	Medications	include	an	H1	anti-
histamine	for	flushing	and	pruritus,	an	H2	antihistamine	or	proton	
pump	 inhibitor	 for	 gastric	 acid	 hypersecretion,	 oral	 cromolyn	
sodium	for	diarrhea	and	abdominal	pain,	and	occasionally	aspirin	
(in	those	who	are	known	to	be	tolerant	of	NSAIDs)	for	severe	flush-
ing	 to	 block	 biosynthesis	 of	 prostaglandin	 D2.	 Systemic	 glucocor-
ticoids	 appear	 to	 alleviate	 malabsorption.	 Mast	 cell	 cytoreductive	
therapy	consisting	of	midostaurin,	avapritinib,	IFN-α,	or	cladribine	
is	 generally	 reserved	 for	 advanced,	 nonindolent	 variants	 of	 SM.	
Midostaurin	 and	 avapritinib	 are	 small-molecule	 tyrosine	 kinase	
inhibitors	with	activity	against	both	mutated	KIT	D816V	and	wild-
type	KIT	and	should	be	considered	as	a	first-line	therapy	for	these	
disease	variants.	The	efficacy	of	cytoreductive	therapy	in	mastocy-
tosis	is	variable,	perhaps	because	of	side	effects	that	limit	dosages.	
Imatinib	is	not	effective	in	most	cases	as	the	D816V	KIT	mutation	
mediates	resistance.	Combination	chemotherapy	is	appropriate	for	
the	frank	leukemias.	Stem	cell	transplantation	has	been	shown	to	
be	effective	in	a	small	subset	of	patients	with	advanced	mastocyto-
sis.	A	self-injectable	epinephrine	prescription	is	recommended	for	
most	 patients	 due	 to	 increased	 incidence	 of	 anaphylaxis.	 Patients	
with	 a	 history	 of	 systemic	 Hymenoptera	 venom	 reaction	 should	
be	evaluated	for	venom-specific	IgE	and	placed	on	lifelong	venom	
immunotherapy	if	positive.

355 Autoimmunity and 
Autoimmune Diseases
Betty Diamond, Peter E. Lipsky

One	 of	 the	 central	 features	 of	 the	 immune	 system	 is	 the	 capacity	
to	 mount	 an	 inflammatory	 response	 to	 potentially	 harmful	 foreign	
materials	while	avoiding	damage	to	self-tissues.	Whereas	recognition	
of	 self	 plays	 an	 important	 role	 in	 shaping	 the	 repertoires	 of	 immune	
receptors	 on	 both	 T	 and	 B	 cells	 and	 in	 clearing	 apoptotic	 and	 other	
tissue	 debris	 from	 sites	 throughout	 the	 body,	 the	 development	 of	
potentially	 harmful	 immune	 responses	 to	 self-antigens	 is,	 in	 general,	
prohibited.	The	essential	feature	of	an	autoimmune disease	is	that	tissue	
injury	is	caused	by	the	immunologic	reaction	of	the	organism	against	
its	own	tissues.	Autoimmunity,	on	the	other	hand,	refers	merely	to	the	
presence	of	antibodies	or	T	lymphocytes	that	react	with	self-antigens	
and	does	not	necessarily	imply	that	the	self-reactivity	has	pathogenic	
consequences.	Autoimmunity	is	present	in	all	individuals	and	increases	
with	age;	however,	autoimmune	disease	occurs	only	in	those	individ-
uals	in	whom	the	breakdown	of	one	or	more	of	the	basic	mechanisms	
regulating	 immune	 tolerance	 results	 in	 self-reactivity	 that	 can	 cause	
tissue	damage.

Polyreactive	 autoantibodies	 that	 recognize	 many	 host	 antigens	
are	 present	 throughout	 life.	 These	 antibodies	 are	 usually	 of	 the	 IgM	
heavy	chain	isotype	and	are	encoded	by	nonmutated	germline	immu-
noglobulin	 variable	 region	 genes.	 These	 antibodies	 are	 essential,	 as	
they	 remove	 apoptotic	 debris	 through	 non-inflammatory	 pathways.	
Expression	of	these	autoantibodies	may	be	increased	after	some	incit-
ing	events.	When	autoimmunity	is	induced	by	an	inciting	event,	such	
as	infection	or	tissue	damage	from	trauma	or	ischemia,	the	autoreac-
tivity	is	generally	self-limited.	When	such	autoimmunity	does	persist,	
however,	pathology	may	or	may	not	result.	Moreover,	even	in	the	pres-
ence	of	organ	pathology,	it	may	be	difficult	to	determine	whether	the	
damage	is	mediated	by	autoreactivity	or	an	ongoing	pathologic	process	
related	 to	 the	 inciting	 trigger.	 Individuals	 with	 autoimmune	 disease	
may	have	numerous	autoantibodies,	only	some	or	even	none	of	which	
may	be	pathogenic.	For	example,	patients	with	systemic	sclerosis	may	
have	a	wide	array	of	antinuclear	antibodies	that	are	important	in	dis-
ease	classification	but	are	not	clearly	pathogenic;	in	contrast,	patients	
with	pemphigus	may	also	exhibit	a	wide	array	of	autoantibodies,	one	
of	which	(antibody	to	desmoglein	1	and	3)	is	known	to	be	pathogenic.

MECHANISMS OF AUTOIMMUNITY
Since	Ehrlich	first	postulated	the	existence	of	mechanisms	to	prevent	
the	 generation	 of	 self-reactivity	 in	 the	 early	 1900s,	 there	 has	 been	 a	
progressive	 increase	 in	 understanding	 of	 this	 prohibition	 in	 parallel	
with	 a	 progressive	 increase	 in	 understanding	 of	 the	 immune	 system.	
Burnet’s	 clonal	 selection	 theory	 included	 the	 idea	 that	 interaction	 of	
lymphoid	cells	with	their	specific	antigens	during	fetal	or	early	post-
natal	life	would	lead	to	deletion	of	such	“forbidden	clones.”	This	idea	
was	 refuted,	 however,	 when	 it	 was	 shown	 that	 autoimmune	 diseases	
could	 be	 induced	 in	 experimental	 animals	 by	 simple	 immunization

procedures,	that	autoantigen-binding	cells	could	be	demonstrated	eas-
ily	in	the	circulation	of	normal	individuals,	and	that	self-limited	auto-
immune	 phenomena	 frequently	 developed	 after	 tissue	 damage	 from	
infection	or	trauma.	These	observations	indicated	that	clones	of	cells	
capable	of	responding	to	autoantigens	were	present	in	the	repertoire	of	
antigen-reactive	cells	in	normal	adults	and	suggested	that	mechanisms	
in	 addition	 to	 clonal	 deletion	 were	 responsible	 for	 preventing	 their	
activation.

Currently,	 three	 general	 processes	 are	 thought	 to	 be	 involved	 in	 the	
maintenance	of	selective	unresponsiveness	to	autoantigens	(Table 355-1):	
(1)	 sequestration	 of	 self-antigens,	 rendering	 them	 inaccessible	 to	 the	
immune	 system;	 (2)	 specific	 unresponsiveness	 (tolerance	 or	 anergy)	
of	 relevant	 T	 or	 B	 cells;	 and	 (3)	 limitation	 of	 potential	 reactivity	 by	
regulatory	 mechanisms.	 Derangements	 of	 these	 normal	 processes	
may	 predispose	 to	 the	 development	 of	 autoimmunity	 (Table  355-2).	
In	 general,	 induction	 of	 autoimmunity	 requires	 both	 an	 exogenous	
trigger,	 such	 as	 bacterial	 or	 viral	 infection	 or	 cigarette	 smoking	 or	
a	 perturbation	 of	 the	 microbiome,	 and	 the	 presence	 of	 endoge-
nous	 abnormalities	 in	 the	 cells	 of	 the	 immune	 system.	 A	 number	
of	 exogenous	 triggers	 have	 been	 identified.	 For	 example,	 microbial	
superantigens,	 such	 as	 staphylococcal	 protein	 A	 and	 staphylococcal	
enterotoxins,	are	substances	that	can	stimulate	a	broad	range	of	T	and	
B	cells	through	specific	interactions	with	selected	families	of	immune	
receptors,	 irrespective	 of	 their	 antigen	 specificity.	 If	 autoantigen-	
reactive	 T	 and/or	 B	 cells	 express	 these	 receptors,	 autoimmunity	 may	
be	induced	by	stimulation	with	these	substances.	Alternatively,	molec-
ular	 mimicry	 or	 cross-reactivity	 between	 a	 microbial	 product	 and	 a

self-antigen	may	lead	to	activation	of	autoreactive	lymphocytes.	One	of	
the	best	examples	of	autoreactivity	and	autoimmune	disease	resulting	
from	 molecular	 mimicry	 is	 rheumatic	 fever,	 in	 which	 antibodies	 to	
the	 M	 protein	 of	 streptococci	 cross-react	 with	 myosin,	 laminin,	 and	
other	matrix	proteins	as	well	as	with	neuronal	antigens.	Deposition	of	
these	autoantibodies	in	the	heart	initiates	an	inflammatory	response,	
whereas	their	penetration	into	the	brain	can	result	in	Sydenham’s	cho-
rea.	 Molecular	 mimicry	 between	 microbial	 proteins	 and	 host	 tissues	
has	 been	 reported	 in	 type	 1	 diabetes	 mellitus,	 rheumatoid	 arthritis,	
systemic	lupus	erythematosus	(SLE),	celiac	disease,	and	multiple	scle-
rosis.	 It	 is	 presumed	 that	 infectious	 agents	 may	 be	 able	 to	 overcome	
self-tolerance	 because	 they	 possess	 pathogen-associated  molecular 
patterns	(PAMPs).	These	molecules	(e.g.,	bacterial	endotoxin,	RNA,	or	
DNA)	exert	adjuvant-like	effects	on	the	immune	system	by	interacting	
with	Toll-like receptors	(TLRs)	and	other	pattern recognition receptors	
(PRRs)	 that	 increase	 the	 immunogenicity	 and	 immunostimulatory	
capacity	 of	 the	 microbial	 material.	 The	 adjuvants	 activate	 dendritic	
cells,	 which	 in	 turn	 stimulate	 the	 activation	 of	 previously	 quiescent	
lymphocytes	that	recognize	both	microbial	antigens	and	self-antigens.	
Alternatively,	PAMPs	can	activate	PRRs	on	tissue	epithelial	cells,	which	
then	activate	dendritic	cells.	Cellular	and	tissue	damage	can	result	in	
release	 of	 damage-associated  molecular  patterns	 (DAMPs),	 including	
DNA,	RNA	nucleosomes,	and	other	tissue	debris,	which	may	activate	
cells	of	the	inflammatory	and	immune	systems	through	engagement	of	
the	same	array	of	PRRs.	This	pathway	may	lead	to	autoimmune	disease	
in	individuals	who	have	impairments	in	mechanisms	for	clearance	of	
tissue	debris.

Although	previous	work	focused	on	the	role	of	pathogenic	microor-
ganisms	in	triggering	autoimmunity,	more	recent	studies	have	focused	
on	the	role	of	the	microbiome,	the	collection	of	nonpathogenic	micro-
organisms	 that	 reside	 on	 various	 body	 surfaces.	 It	 has	 become	 clear	
that	the	interaction	between	specific	constituents	of	these	microbiota	
and	the	immune	system	can	shape	the	nature	of	the	immune	response	
to	either	favor	or	discourage	immune/inflammatory	responses.	Thus,	
some	genera	within	the	microbiome	may	favor	a	nonresponsive	state	
dominated	by	regulatory	T	cells,	whereas	others	may	favor	the	devel-
opment	 of	 T	 effector	 cells	 and	 a	 proinflammatory	 state.	 Gender	 bias	
in	 autoimmune	 conditions	 may	 also	 be	 favored	 by	 differences	 in	 the	
dominant	organisms	within	the	microbiome.

Endogenous	derangements	of	the	immune	system	also	contribute	to	
the	loss	of	immunologic	tolerance	to	self-antigens	and	the	development	
of	autoimmunity	(Table	355-2).	Some	autoantigens	reside	in	immuno-
logically	privileged	sites,	such	as	the	brain	or	the	anterior	chamber	of	
the	eye.	These	sites	are	characterized	by	the	inability	of	engrafted	tissue	
to	elicit	immune	responses.	Immunologic	privilege	results	from	a	num-
ber	of	events,	including	the	limited	entry	of	proteins	from	those	sites	
into	lymphatics,	the	local	production	of	immunosuppressive	cytokines	
such	as	transforming	growth	factor	β,	and	the	local	expression	of	mole-
cules	(including	Fas	ligand	and	PD-1	ligand)	that	can	induce	apoptosis	
or	quiescence	of	activated	T	cells.	Lymphoid	cells	remain	in	a	state	of	
immunologic	ignorance	(neither	activated	nor	anergized)	with	regard	
to	proteins	expressed	uniquely	in	immunologically	privileged	sites.	If	
the	privileged	site	is	damaged	by	trauma	or	inflammation	or	if	T	cells	
are	 activated	 elsewhere,	 proteins	 expressed	 at	 this	 site	 can	 become	
immunogenic	and	be	the	targets	of	immunologic	assault.	In	multiple	
sclerosis	and	sympathetic	ophthalmia,	for	example,	antigens	uniquely	
expressed	in	the	brain	and	eye,	respectively,	become	the	target	of	acti-
vated	T	cells.

Alterations	 in	 antigen	 presentation	 may	 also	 contribute	 to	 auto-
immunity.	 Peptide	 determinants	 (epitopes)	 of	 a	 self-antigen	 that	 are	
not	routinely	presented	to	lymphocytes	may	be	recognized	as	a	result	
of	 altered	 proteolytic	 processing	 of	 the	 molecule	 and	 the	 ensuing	
presentation	of	novel	peptides	(cryptic epitopes).	When	B	cells	rather	
than	dendritic	cells	present	self-antigen,	they	may	also	present	cryptic	
epitopes	that	can	activate	autoreactive	T	cells.	These	cryptic	epitopes	
will	 not	 previously	 have	 been	 available	 to	 affect	 the	 silencing	 of	
autoreactive	 lymphocytes.	 Furthermore,	 once	 there	 is	 immunologic	
recognition	 of	 one	 protein	 component	 of	 a	 multimolecular	 complex,	
reactivity	 may	 be	 induced	 to	 other	 components	 of	 the	 complex	 after

internalization	 and	 presentation	 of	 all	 molecules	 within	 the	 complex	
(epitope	 spreading).	 Finally,	 inflammation,	 environmental	 agents,	
drug	 exposure,	 or	 normal	 senescence	 may	 cause	 a	 posttranslational	
alteration	in	proteins,	resulting	in	the	generation	of	immune	responses	
that	cross-react	with	normal	self-proteins.	For	example,	the	induction	
and/or	 release	 of	 protein	 arginine	 deiminase	 enzymes	 results	 in	 the	
conversion	 of	 arginine	 residues	 to	 citrullines	 in	 a	 variety	 of	 proteins,	
thereby	altering	their	capacity	to	induce	immune	responses.	Production	
of	 antibodies	 to	 citrullinated	 proteins	 has	 been	 observed	 in	 rheuma-
toid	 arthritis	 and	 chronic	 lung	 disease	 as	 well	 as	 in	 normal	 smokers.		
These	 antibodies	 can	 contribute	 to	 organ	 pathology.	 Alterations	 in	
the	 availability	 and	 presentation	 of	 autoantigens	 may	 be	 important	
components	 of	 immunoreactivity	 in	 certain	 models	 of	 organ-specific	
autoimmune	diseases.	In	addition,	these	factors	may	be	relevant	to	an	
understanding	 of	 the	 pathogenesis	 of	 various	 drug-induced	 autoim-
mune	conditions.	However,	the	diversity	of	autoreactivity	manifesting	
in	non-organ-specific	systemic	autoimmune	diseases	suggests	that	these	
conditions	may	result	from	a	more	general	activation	of	the	immune	
system	rather	than	from	an	alteration	in	individual	self-antigens.

Many	 autoimmune	 diseases	 are	 characterized	 by	 the	 presence	 of	
antibodies	 that	 react	 with	 antigens	 present	 in	 apoptotic	 material.	
Defects	 in	 the	 clearance	 of	 apoptotic	 material	 have	 been	 shown	 to	
elicit	 autoimmunity	 and	 autoimmune	 disease	 in	 a	 number	 of	 animal	
models.	Moreover,	such	defects	have	been	found	in	patients	with	SLE.	
Apoptotic	debris	that	is	not	cleared	quickly	by	the	immune	system	can	
function	 as	 endogenous	 ligands	 for	 a	 number	 of	 PRRs	 on	 dendritic	
cells	 and	 B	 cells.	 Under	 such	 circumstances,	 dendritic	 cells	 and/or		
B	cells	are	activated,	and	an	immune	response	to	apoptotic	debris	can	
develop.	In	addition,	the	presence	of	uncleared	extracellular	apoptotic	
material	 within	 germinal	 centers	 of	 secondary	 lymphoid	 organs	 in	
patients	 with	 SLE	 may	 facilitate	 the	 direct	 activation	 of	 autoimmune	
B-cell	 clones.	 Similarly,	 cellular	 contents,	 including	 nuclear	 material,	
released	from	neutrophils	undergoing	a	form	of	cell	death	referred	to	
as	NETosis,	may	be	particularly	immunogenic.

Deficiency	in	C1q,	likewise,	can	predispose	or	exacerbate	autoim-
munity.	C1q	assists	in	the	clearance	of	apoptotic	debris	and	NETotic	
material	binding	to	IgM	autoantibodies	and	to	inhibitory	receptors	on	
monocytes	and	dendritic	cells.	If	C1q	is	not	present,	a	mechanism	of	
immune	 suppression	 is	 lost.	 Moreover,	 if	 antibodies	 have	 undergone	
class	 switch	 recombination	 to	 IgG,	 the	 apoptotic	 debris	 containing	
immune	 complexes	 will	 engage	 activating	 Fc	 receptors	 on	 myeloid	
cells	 to	 induce	 an	 inflammatory	 response.	 Studies	 in	 a	 number	 of	
experimental	 models	 have	 suggested	 that	 intense	 stimulation	 of	 T	
lymphocytes	 can	 produce	 nonspecific	 signals	 that	 directly	 lead	 to	
polyclonal	 B-cell	 activation	 with	 the	 formation	 of	 multiple	 autoan-
tibodies	 and	 bypass	 the	 need	 for	 antigen-specific	 helper	 T	 cells.	 For	
example,	antinuclear,	antierythrocyte,	and	antilymphocyte	antibodies	
are	 produced	 during	 the	 chronic	 graft-versus-host	 reaction.	 In	 addi-
tion,	autoimmune	hemolytic	anemia	and	immune	complex–mediated	
glomerulonephritis	can	be	induced	in	this	manner.	Direct	stimulation	
of	 B	 lymphocytes	 can	 also	 lead	 to	 the	 production	 of	 autoantibodies.	
Thus,	the	administration	of	polyclonal	B-cell	activators,	such	as	bacte-
rial	endotoxin,	to	normal	mice	leads	to	the	production	of	a	number	of	
autoantibodies,	including	those	to	DNA	and	IgG	(rheumatoid	factor).	
A	 variety	 of	 genetic	 modifications	 resulting	 in	 hyperresponsiveness	
of	 B	 cells	 also	 can	 lead	 to	 the	 production	 of	 autoantibodies	 and,	 in	
animals	 of	 appropriate	 genetic	 background,	 a	 lupus-like	 syndrome.	
Moreover,	excess	B-cell	activating	factor	(BAFF),	a	B-cell	survival-pro-
moting	cytokine,	can	impair	B-cell	tolerance,	cause	T	cell–independent	
B-cell	 activation,	 and	 lead	 to	 the	 development	 of	 autoimmunity.	 SLE	
can	also	be	induced	in	mice	through	exuberant	dendritic	cell	activa-
tion,	through	a	redundancy	of	TLR7	and	transposition	to	the	Y	chro-
mosome	(as	in	BXSB-Yaa	mice),	or	through	exposure	to	CpG,	a	ligand	
for	TLR9.	The	ensuing	induction	of	inflammatory	mediators	can	cause	
a	 switch	 from	 the	 production	 of	 nonpathogenic	 IgM	 autoantibodies	
to	the	production	of	pathogenic	IgG	autoantibodies	in	the	absence	of	
antigen-specific	T-cell	help.	Aberrant	selection	of	the	B-	or	T-cell	rep-
ertoire	at	the	time	of	antigen	receptor	expression	can	also	predispose	
to	 autoimmunity.	 For	 example,	 B-cell	 immunodeficiency	 caused	 by	

an	absence	of	the	B-cell	receptor–associated	kinase	(Bruton’s	tyrosine	
kinase)	 leads	 to	 X-linked	 agammaglobulinemia.	 This	 syndrome	 is	
characterized	 by	 reduced	 B-cell	 numbers.	 This	 leads	 to	 high	 levels	
of	BAFF,	which	alter	B-cell	selection	and	result	in	greater	survival	of	
autoreactive	B	cells.	Likewise,	negative	selection	of	autoreactive	T	cells	
in	the	thymus	requires	expression	of	the	autoimmune	regulator	(AIRE)	
gene	that	enables	the	expression	of	tissue-specific	proteins	in	thymic	
medullary	epithelial	cells.	Peptides	from	these	proteins	are	expressed	
in	the	context	of	major	histocompatibility	complex	(MHC)	molecules	
and	mediate	the	central	deletion	of	autoreactive	T	cells.	The	absence	
of	 AIRE	 gene	 expression	 leads	 to	 a	 failure	 of	 negative	 selection	 of	
autoreactive	cells,	autoantibody	production,	and	severe	inflammatory	
destruction	 of	 multiple	 organs.	 Individuals	 deficient	 in	 AIRE	 gene	
expression	 develop	 autoimmune	 polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–
ectodermal	dystrophy	(APECED).

Primary	 alterations	 in	 the	 activity	 of	 T	 and/or	 B	 cells,	 cytokine	
imbalances,	or	defective	immunoregulatory	circuits	may	also	contribute	
to	 the	 emergence	 of	 autoimmunity.	 Diminished	 production	 of	 tumor	
necrosis	factor	(TNF)	and	interleukin	(IL)	10	has	been	reported	to	be	
associated	with	the	development	of	autoimmunity.	Overproduction	or	
therapeutic	administration	of	type	1	interferon	has	also	been	associated	
with	 autoimmunity.	 Overexpression	 of	 costimulatory	 molecules	 on		
T	cells	similarly	can	lead	to	autoantibody	production.

Autoimmunity	may	also	result	from	an	abnormality	of	immunoreg-
ulatory	mechanisms.	Observations	made	in	both	human	autoimmune	
disease	 and	 animal	 models	 suggest	 that	 defects	 in	 the	 generation	
and	 expression	 of	 regulatory	 T-cell	 (Treg)	 activity	 may	 allow	 the	
production	 of	 autoimmunity.	 It	 has	 been	 appreciated	 that	 the	 IPEX	
(immunodysregulation,	 polyendocrinopathy,	 enteropathy	 X-linked)	
syndrome	results	from	the	failure	to	express	the	 FOXP3	gene,	which	
encodes	a	molecule	critical	in	the	differentiation	of	Tregs.	Administra-
tion	of	normal	Tregs	or	of	factors	derived	from	them	can	prevent	the	
development	of	autoimmune	disease	in	rodent	models	of	autoimmu-
nity,	and	allogeneic	stem	cell	transplantation	ameliorates	human	IPEX.	
Abnormalities	in	the	function	of	Tregs	have	been	noted	in	a	number	
of	 human	 autoimmune	 diseases,	 including	 rheumatoid	 arthritis	 and	
SLE,	 although	 it	 remains	 uncertain	 whether	 these	 functional	 abnor-
malities	 are	 causative	 or	 are	 secondary	 to	 inflammation.	 One	 of	 the	
mechanisms	by	which	Tregs	control	immune/inflammatory	responses	
is	by	the	production	of	the	cytokine	IL-10.	In	this	regard,	children	with	
a	deficiency	in	the	expression	of	IL-10	or	the	IL-10	receptor	develop	
inflammatory	bowel	disease	that	mimics	Crohn’s	disease	and	that	can	
be	cured	by	allogeneic	stem	cell	transplantation.	Furthermore,	recent	
data	 indicate	 that	 B	 cells	 may	 also	 exert	 regulatory	 function,	 largely	
through	the	production	of	IL-10.	Deficiency	of	IL-10-producing	regu-
latory	B	cells	can	prolong	the	course	of	multiple	sclerosis	in	an	animal	
model,	 and	 such	 cells	 are	 thought	 to	 be	 functionally	 diminished	 in	
human	 SLE.	 Finally,	 myeloid	 cells	 can	 inhibit	 immune	 responses.	
Depending	on	the	microenvironment	and	cytokine	stimulation,	mac-
rophages	can	functionally	differentiate	into	classical	M1	or	inflamma-
tory	macrophages	with	enhanced	microbicidal	and	cytotoxic	activities	
or	alternatively	activated	or	M2	macrophages	with	anti-inflammatory	
and	 reparative	 capabilities.	 Abnormalities	 in	 this	 balance	 have	 been	
noted	to	contribute	to	animal	models	of	autoimmunity	and	to	human	
disease	where	a	switch	from	M2-like	to	M1-like	macrophages	seems	to	
be	involved	in	development	of	disease	activity	in	SLE.	Importantly,	C1q	
helps	 maintain	 macrophages	 in	 a	 quiescent	 state.	 Of	 note,	 dendritic	
cells	also	begin	as	tolerogenic	cells	but	become	immunogenic	with	acti-
vation.	This	pathway	to	autoimmunity	has	become	important	with	the	
widespread	use	of	checkpoint	inhibitor	therapy	for	cancer,	which	leads	
to	autoimmune	symptoms	in	up	to	one-third	of	recipients.

It	 should	 be	 apparent	 that	 no	 single	 mechanism	 can	 explain	 all	
the	 varied	 manifestations	 of	 autoimmunity	 or	 autoimmune	 disease.	
Furthermore,	 genetic	 evaluation	 has	 shown	 that	 convergence	 of	 a	
number	 of	 abnormalities	 is	 most	 often	 required	 for	 the	 induction	 of	
an	autoimmune	disease.	Additional	factors	that	appear	to	be	important	
determinants	in	the	induction	of	autoimmunity	include	age,	sex	(many	
autoimmune	 diseases	 are	 far	 more	 common	 in	 women),	 exposure	 to	
infectious	 agents,	 and	 environmental	 contacts.	 How	 these	 disparate

investigated	intensively.
 ■ GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS

Evidence	in	humans	that	there	are	susceptibility	genes	for	autoim-
munity	comes	from	family	studies	and	especially	from	studies	of	
twins.	 Studies	 in	 type	 1	 diabetes	 mellitus,	 rheumatoid	 arthritis,	
multiple	sclerosis,	and	SLE	have	shown	~15–30%	disease	concordance	
in	monozygotic	twins,	whereas	the	figure	is	<5%	for	dizygotic	twins.	
The	 occurrence	 of	 different	 autoimmune	 diseases	 within	 the	 same	
family	has	suggested	that	certain	susceptibility	genes	may	predispose	to	
a	variety	of	autoimmune	diseases.	Many	hundreds	of	genetic	polymor-
phisms	associated	with	one	or	more	autoimmune	diseases	have	been	
identified	to	date.	As	predicted,	some	genes	are	associated	with	multi-
ple	 autoimmune	 diseases,	 whereas	 others	 are	 specifically	 associated	
with	 only	 one	 autoimmune	 condition.	 Moreover,	 recent	 genetic	 evi-
dence	 suggests	 that	 clusters	 of	 genetic	 risk	 factors	 can	 commonly	 be	
found	in	groups	of	autoimmune	diseases.	For	example,	one	group	of	
genetic	risk	factors	is	most	frequently	associated	with	Crohn’s	disease,	
psoriasis,	 and	 multiple	 sclerosis,	 whereas	 a	 second	 is	 most	 strongly	
associated	 with	 celiac	 disease,	 rheumatoid	 arthritis,	 and	 SLE.	 These	
results	imply	that	autoimmune	diseases	with	widely	different	clinical	
presentations	and	patterns	of	organ	involvement	may	involve	similar	
immunopathogenic	 pathways	 or	 endophenotypes.	 For	 example,	 the	
same	allele	of	the	gene	encoding	PTPN22	is	associated	with	multiple	
autoimmune	diseases.	Its	product	is	a	phosphatase	expressed	by	a	vari-
ety	 of	 hematopoietic	 cells	 that	 downregulates	 antigen	 receptor–	
mediated	stimulation	of	T	and	B	cells.	The	risk	allele	is	associated	with	
type	1	diabetes	mellitus,	rheumatoid	arthritis,	and	SLE	in	some	popu-
lations.	In	recent	years,	genome-wide	association	studies	have	demon-
strated	a	variety	of	other	genes	that	are	involved	in	human	autoimmune	
diseases.	Importantly,	the	genetic	contribution	to	autoimmune	disease	
differs	somewhat	in	people	of	different	ancestries.	Most	genes	individ-
ually	 confer	 a	 relatively	 low	 risk	 for	 autoimmune	 diseases	 and	 are	
found	 in	 normal	 individuals	 but,	 in	 aggregate,	 are	 associated	 with	
substantial	risk	of	disease.	In	addition,	most	polymorphisms	associated	
with	autoimmune	diseases	are	in	noncoding	regions	of	DNA,	implying	
that	protein	expression	levels	rather	that	altered	function	might	convey	
most	genetic	risk	for	autoimmune	diseases.	Abnormalities	in	epigenet-
ics	 or	 the	 mechanisms,	 such	 as	 cellular	 metabolism,	 controlling	 and	
influencing	gene	expression	have	also	been	implicated	in	contributing	
to	autoimmune	diseases.	No	single	gene	or	epigenetic	modification	has	
been	identified	that	is	essential	for	autoimmune	diseases.	In	addition	to	
this	evidence	from	humans,	certain	inbred	mouse	strains	reproducibly	

develop	specific	spontaneous	or	experimentally	induced	autoimmune	
diseases,	 whereas	 others	 do	 not.	 These	 findings	 have	 now	 led	 to	 a	
search	for	genes	that	might	be	protective.

The	 strongest	 consistent	 association	 for	 susceptibility	 to	 autoim-
mune	disease	is	with	particular	MHC	alleles.	It	has	been	suggested	that	
the	association	of	MHC	genotype	with	autoimmune	disease	relates	to	
differences	in	the	ability	of	different	allelic	variations	of	MHC	mole-
cules	to	present	autoantigenic	peptides	to	autoreactive	T	cells.	An	alter-
native	hypothesis	involves	the	role	of	MHC	alleles	in	shaping	the	T-cell	
receptor	repertoire	during	T-cell	ontogeny	in	the	thymus.	In	addition,	
specific	MHC	gene	products	may	themselves	be	the	source	of	peptides	
that	can	be	recognized	by	T	cells.	Cross-reactivity	between	such	MHC	
peptides	 and	 peptides	 derived	 from	 proteins	 produced	 by	 common	
microbes	 may	 trigger	 autoimmunity	 by	 molecular	 mimicry.	 Finally,	
there	 appears	 to	 be	 a	 contribution	 from	 non-MHC	 genes	 encoded	
within	the	MHC	locus.	However,	MHC	genotype	alone	does	not	deter-
mine	the	development	of	autoimmunity.	Identical	twins	are	far	more	
likely	 to	 develop	 the	 same	 autoimmune	 disease	 than	 MHC-identical	
nontwin	 siblings.	 Studies	 of	 the	 genetics	 of	 type	 1	 diabetes	 mellitus,	
SLE,	rheumatoid	arthritis,	and	multiple	sclerosis	in	humans	and	mice	
have	identified	several	independently	segregating	disease	susceptibility	
loci	in	addition	to	the	MHC.	Genes	that	encode	molecules	of	the	innate	
immune	 response	 are	 also	 involved	 in	 autoimmunity.	 In	 humans,	
inherited	 homozygous	 deficiency	 of	 the	 early	 proteins	 of	 the	 classic	
pathway	 of	 complement	 (C1q,	 C4,	 or	 C2)	 as	 well	 as	 genes	 involved	
in	the	type	1	interferon	pathway	are	very	strongly	associated	with	the	
development	of	SLE.
 ■ IMMUNOPATHOGENIC MECHANISMS IN 
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
The	 mechanisms	 of	 tissue	 injury	 in	 autoimmune	 diseases	 can	 be	
divided	 into	 antibody-mediated	 and	 cell-mediated	 processes.	 Repre-
sentative	examples	are	listed	in	Table 355-3.

The	pathogenicity	of	autoantibodies	can	be	mediated	through	sev-
eral	 mechanisms,	 including	 opsonization	 of	 soluble	 factors	 or	 cells,	
activation	of	an	inflammatory	cascade	via	the	complement	system,	and	
interference	with	the	physiologic	function	of	soluble	molecules	or	cells	
or	immune	complex–mediated	activation	of	cells	through	engagement	
of	activating	Fc	receptors.

In	autoimmune	thrombocytopenic	purpura,	opsonization	of	plate-
lets	 targets	 them	 for	 elimination	 by	 phagocytes.	 Likewise,	 in	 auto-
immune	 hemolytic	 anemia,	 binding	 of	 immunoglobulin	 to	 red	 cell	
membranes	leads	to	phagocytosis	and	lysis	of	the	opsonized	cell.	Good-
pasture’s	 syndrome,	 a	 disease	 characterized	 by	 lung	 hemorrhage	 and

severe	glomerulonephritis,	represents	an	example	of	antibody	binding	
leading	to	local	activation	of	complement	and	neutrophil	accumulation	
and	activation.	The	autoantibody	in	this	disease	binds	to	the	α3	chain	
of	type	IV	collagen	in	the	basement	membrane.	In	SLE,	activation	of	
the	complement	cascade	at	sites	of	immunoglobulin	deposition	in	renal	
glomeruli	 is	 considered	 to	 be	 a	 major	 mechanism	 of	 renal	 damage.	
Moreover,	the	DNA-	and	RNA-containing	immune	complexes	in	SLE	
activate	TLR9	and	TLR7,	respectively,	in	plasmacytoid	dendritic	cells	
and	promote	the	production	of	type	1	interferon	and	proinflammatory	
cytokines	conducive	to	amplification	of	the	autoimmune	response.

Autoantibodies	can	also	interfere	with	normal	physiologic	functions	of	
cells	or	soluble	factors.	Autoantibodies	to	hormone	receptors	can	lead	to	
stimulation	of	cells	or	to	inhibition	of	cell	function	through	interference	
with	receptor	signaling.	For	example,	long-acting	thyroid	stimulators—
autoantibodies	that	bind	to	the	receptor	for	thyroid-stimulating	hormone	
(TSH)—are	present	in	Graves’	disease	and	function	as	agonists,	causing	
the	thyroid	to	respond	as	if	there	were	an	excess	of	TSH.	Alternatively,	
antibodies	 to	 the	 insulin	 receptor	 can	 cause	 insulin-resistant	 diabetes	
mellitus	through	receptor	blockade.	In	myasthenia	gravis,	autoantibodies	
to	the	acetylcholine	receptor	can	be	detected	in	85–90%	of	patients	and	
are	responsible	for	muscle	weakness.	The	exact	location	of	the	antigenic	
epitope,	 the	 valence	 and	 affinity	 of	 the	 antibody,	 and	 perhaps	 other	
characteristics	 determine	 whether	 activation	 or	 blockade	 results	 from	
antibody	binding.

Antiphospholipid	 antibodies	 are	 associated	 with	 thromboembolic	
events	in	primary	and	secondary	antiphospholipid	syndrome	and	have	
also	 been	 associated	 with	 fetal	 loss.	 The	 major	 antibody	 is	 directed	
to	 the	 phospholipid–β2-glycoprotein	 I	 complex	 and	 appears	 to	 exert	
a	 procoagulant	 effect.	 In	 pemphigus	 vulgaris,	 autoantibodies	 bind	 to	
desmoglein	 1	 and	 3,	 components	 of	 the	 epidermal	 cell	 desmosome,	
and	 play	 a	 role	 in	 the	 induction	 of	 the	 disease.	 These	 antibodies	
exert	their	pathologic	effect	by	disrupting	cell–cell	junctions	through	
stimulation	of	the	production	of	epithelial	proteases,	with	consequent	
blister	 formation.	 Cytoplasmic	 antineutrophil	 cytoplasmic	 antibody	
(c-ANCA),	found	in	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis,	is	an	antibody	
to	an	intracellular	antigen,	the	29-kDa	serine	protease	(proteinase-3).	
In	vitro	experiments	have	shown	that	IgG	anti-c-ANCA	causes	cellular	
activation	and	degranulation	of	primed	neutrophils.

It	 is	 important	 to	 note	 that	 autoantibodies	 of	 a	 given	 specificity	
may	 cause	 disease	 only	 in	 genetically	 susceptible	 hosts,	 as	 has	 been	
shown	in	experimental	models	of	myasthenia	gravis,	SLE,	rheumatic	
fever,	 and	 rheumatoid	 arthritis.	 Furthermore,	 once	 organ	 damage	 is	
initiated,	new	inflammatory	cascades	are	initiated	that	can	sustain	and	
amplify	the	autoimmune	process.	Finally,	some	autoantibodies	seem	to	
be	markers	for	disease	but	have,	as	yet,	no	known	pathogenic	potential.
In	many	autoimmune	diseases,	myeloid	cells	play	an	essential	role	
as	 effector	 cells	 of	 inflammation.	 M1-like	 macrophages	 activated	 by	
cytokines,	 such	 as	 type	 2	 interferon,	 immune	 complexes	 through	
activating	Fc	receptors,	or	surface	or	intracellular	TLRs	can	produce	a	
number	of	inflammatory	cytokines,	including	IL-1,	TNF,	and	IL-6,	that	
contribute	to	tissue	inflammation.

 ■ AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
Manifestations	of	autoimmunity	are	found	in	a	large	number	of	patho-
logic	 conditions.	 However,	 their	 presence	 does	 not	 necessarily	 imply	
that	 the	 pathologic	 process	 is	 an	 autoimmune	 disease.	 A	 number	 of	
attempts	to	establish	formal	criteria	for	the	classification	of	diseases	as	
autoimmune	 have	 been	 made,	 but	 none	 is	 universally	 accepted.	 One	
set	of	criteria	is	shown	in	Table 355-4;	however,	this	scheme	should	be	
viewed	merely	as	a	guide	in	consideration	of	the	problem.

To	classify	a	disease	as	autoimmune,	it	is	necessary	to	demonstrate	
that	the	immune	response	to	a	self-antigen	causes	the	observed	pathol-
ogy.	 Initially,	 the	 detection	 of	 antibodies	 to	 the	 affected	 tissue	 in	 the	
serum	of	patients	suffering	from	various	diseases	was	taken	as	evidence	
that	these	diseases	had	an	autoimmune	basis.	However,	such	autoan-
tibodies	 can	 also	 be	 found	 when	 tissue	 damage	 is	 caused	 by	 trauma	
or	infection	and,	in	these	cases,	are	secondary	to	tissue	damage.	Thus,	
autoimmunity	must	be	shown	to	be	pathogenic	before	a	disease	is	cat-
egorized	as	autoimmune.

Immunologic Pathogenesis

To	confirm	autoantibody	pathogenicity,	it	may	be	possible	to	trans-
fer	disease	to	experimental	animals	by	the	administration	of	autoanti-
bodies	from	a	patient	leading	to	the	development	of	pathology	in	the	
recipient	that	is	similar	to	that	seen	in	the	patient.	This	scenario	has	
been	documented,	for	example,	in	Graves’	disease.	Some	autoimmune	
diseases	can	be	transferred	from	mother	to	fetus	and	are	observed	in	
the	 newborn	 babies.	 The	 symptoms	 of	 the	 disease	 in	 the	 newborn	
usually	 disappear	 as	 the	 levels	 of	 maternal	 antibody	 decrease.	 An	
exception,	however,	is	congenital	heart	block,	in	which	damage	to	the	
developing	conducting	system	of	the	heart	follows	in	utero	transfer	of	
anti-Ro	antibody	from	the	mother	to	the	fetus.	This	antibody	transfer	
can	result	in	a	permanent	developmental	defect	in	the	heart.

In	 most	 situations,	 the	 critical	 factors	 that	 determine	 when	 the	
development	of	autoimmunity	results	in	autoimmune	disease	have	not	
been	delineated.	The	relationship	of	autoimmunity	to	the	development	
of	autoimmune	disease	may	be	associated	with	the	fine	specificity	of	
the	 antibodies	 and	 their	 isotype	 or	 T	 cells	 or	 their	 specific	 effector	
capabilities.	 In	 many	 circumstances,	 a	 mechanistic	 understanding	 of	
the	pathogenic	potential	of	autoantibodies	has	not	been	established.	In	
some	autoimmune	diseases,	biased	production	of	cytokines	by	helper	
T	(TH)	cells	may	play	a	role	in	pathogenesis.	In	this	regard,	T	cells	can	
differentiate	into	specialized	effector	cells	that	predominantly	produce	
interferon	γ	(TH1),	IL-4	(TH2),	or	IL-17	(TH17)	or	that	provide	help	to	
B	cells	(T	follicular	helper	[Tfh])	(Chap. 349).	TH1	cells	facilitate	mac-
rophage	 activation	 and	 classic	 cell-mediated	 immunity,	 whereas	 TH2	
cells	are	thought	to	have	regulatory	functions	and	are	involved	in	the	
resolution	of	normal	immune	responses	as	well	as	in	the	development	
of	responses	to	a	variety	of	parasites.	TH17	cells	produce	a	number	of	
inflammatory	 cytokines,	 including	 IL-17	 and	 IL-22,	 and	 seem	 to	 be	
prominently	 involved	 in	 host	 resistance	 to	 certain	 fungal	 infections.	
Tfh	cells	help	B	cells	by	constitutively	producing	IL-21.	In	a	number	of	
autoimmune	diseases,	such	as	rheumatoid	arthritis,	multiple	sclerosis,	
type	 1	 diabetes	 mellitus,	 ankylosing	 spondylitis,	 and	 Crohn’s	 disease,	
there	appears	to	be	biased	differentiation	of	TH1	and	TH17	cells,	with	
resultant	organ	damage.	Studies	suggest	an	accentuated	differentiation	
of	TH17	cells	associated	with	animal	models	of	inflammatory	arthritis,	
whereas	increased	differentiation	of	Tfh	cells	has	been	associated	with	
SLE.	Importantly,	genetically	determined	or	environmentally	induced	
features	of	the	target	organ	may	determine	susceptibility	of	the	target	
organ	to	autoantibodies	or	autoreactive	T	cell–mediated	damage.
 ■ ORGAN-SPECIFIC VERSUS SYSTEMIC 
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
The	 spectrum	 of	 autoimmune	 diseases	 ranges	 from	 conditions	 spe-
cifically	 affecting	 a	 single	 organ	 to	 systemic	 disorders	 that	 involve	
many	 organs	 (Table  355-5).	 Hashimoto’s	 autoimmune	 thyroiditis	 is	
an	example	of	an	organ-specific	autoimmune	disease	(Chap. 382).	In	
this	 disorder,	 a	 specific	 lesion	 in	 the	 thyroid	 is	 associated	 with	 infil-
tration	of	mononuclear	cells	and	damage	to	follicular	cells.	Antibody	
to	thyroid	constituents	can	be	demonstrated	in	nearly	all	cases.	Other

organ-	 or	 tissue-specific	 autoimmune	 disorders	 include	 pemphigus	
vulgaris,	autoimmune	hemolytic	anemia,	idiopathic	thrombocytopenic	
purpura,	Goodpasture’s	syndrome,	myasthenia	gravis,	and	sympathetic	
ophthalmia.	 One	 important	 feature	 of	 some	 organ-specific	 autoim-
mune	 diseases	 is	 the	 tendency	 for	 overlap,	 such	 that	 an	 individual	
with	 one	 specific	 syndrome	 is	 more	 likely	 to	 develop	 a	 second	 syn-
drome.	 For	 example,	 there	 is	 a	 high	 incidence	 of	 pernicious	 anemia	
in	 individuals	 with	 autoimmune	 thyroiditis.	 More	 striking	 is	 the	
tendency	 for	 individuals	 with	 an	 organ-specific	 autoimmune	 disease	
to	develop	multiple	other	manifestations	of	autoimmunity	without	the	
development	of	associated	organ	pathology.	Thus,	as	many	as	50%	of	
individuals	with	pernicious	anemia	have	non-cross-reacting	antibodies	
to	thyroid	constituents,	whereas	patients	with	myasthenia	gravis	may	
develop	 antinuclear	 antibodies,	 antithyroid	 antibodies,	 rheumatoid	
factor,	 antilymphocyte	 antibodies,	 and	 polyclonal	 hypergammaglob-
ulinemia.	 Part	 of	 the	 explanation	 may	 relate	 to	 the	 genetic	 elements	
shared	by	individuals	with	these	different	diseases.

Systemic	autoimmune	diseases	differ	from	organ-specific	diseases	in	
that	pathologic	lesions	are	found	in	multiple	diverse	organs	and	tissues.	
The	 hallmark	 of	 these	 conditions	 is	 the	 demonstration	 of	 associated	
relevant	autoimmune	manifestations	that	are	likely	to	have	an	etiologic	
role	in	organ	pathology.	SLE	represents	the	prototype	of	these	disorders	
because	of	its	abundant	autoimmune	manifestations	that	characteristi-
cally	 involve	 the	 kidneys,	 joints,	 skin,	 serosal	 surfaces,	 blood	 vessels,	
and	central	nervous	system	(Chap. 356).	The	disease	is	associated	with	
a	vast	array	of	autoantibodies	whose	production	appears	to	be	a	part	
of	a	generalized	hyperreactivity	of	the	humoral	immune	system.	Other	
features	 of	 SLE	 include	 generalized	 B-cell	 hyperresponsiveness	 and	
polyclonal	 hypergammaglobulinemia.	 Current	 evidence	 suggests	 that	
both	 hypo-	 and	 hyperresponsiveness	 to	 antigen	 can	 lead	 to	 survival	
and	activation	of	autoreactive	B	cells	in	SLE.	The	autoantibodies	in	SLE	
are	thought	to	arise	as	part	of	an	accentuated	T	cell–dependent	B-cell	
response	since	most	pathogenic	anti-DNA	autoantibodies	exhibit	evi-
dence	of	extensive	somatic	hypermutation.

TREATMENT
Autoimmune Diseases

Treatment	 of	 autoimmune	 diseases	 can	 focus	 on	 suppressing	 the	
induction	 of	 autoimmunity,	 restoring	 normal	 regulatory	 mech-
anisms,	 or	 inhibiting	 the	 effector	 mechanisms.	 To	 decrease	 the	
number	 or	 function	 of	 autoreactive	 cells,	 immunosuppressive	 or	
ablative	therapies	are	most	commonly	used.	In	recent	years,	cytok-
ine	 blockade	 has	 been	 demonstrated	 to	 be	 effective	 in	 preventing	

immune	activation	in	some	diseases	or	in	inhibiting	the	extensive	
inflammatory	effector	mechanisms	characteristic	of	these	diseases.	
New	 therapies	 have	 also	 been	 developed	 to	 target	 lymphoid	 cells	
more	 specifically	 by	 blocking	 a	 costimulatory	 signal	 needed	 for	
T-	 or	 B-cell	 activation,	 by	 blocking	 the	 migratory	 capacity	 of	
lymphocytes,	or	by	eliminating	the	effector	T	cells	or	B	cells.	The	
efficacy	of	these	therapies	in	some	diseases—e.g.,	SLE	(belimumab),	
rheumatoid	 arthritis	 (TNF	 neutralization,	 IL-6	 receptor	 blockade,	
CD28	 competition,	 B-cell	 depletion,	 IL-1	 neutralization),	 psori-
asis	 (IL-12/23	 depletion,	 TNF	 neutralization),	 and	 inflammatory

DEFINITION AND PREVALENCE
Systemic	lupus	erythematosus	(SLE)	is	an	autoimmune	disease	in	which	
organs	and	cells	undergo	damage	initially	mediated	by	tissue-binding	
autoantibodies	and	immune	complexes.	In	most	patients,	autoantibod-
ies	are	present	for	a	few	years	before	the	first	clinical	symptom	appears.	
Ninety	percent	of	patients	are	women	of	child-bearing	years;	people	of	
all	genders,	ages,	and	ethnic	groups	are	susceptible.	The	prevalence	of	
SLE	 in	 the	 United	 States	 is	 81–144	 per	 100,000.	 Prevalence	 is	 higher	
in	all	nonwhite	races/ethnicities	compared	to	whites,	with	the	highest	
prevalence	in	African-American	and	Afro-Caribbean	women	and	the	
lowest	 in	 white	 men.	 SLE	 is	 5.5–6.5	 times	 more	 prevalent	 in	 women	
than	in	men.

PATHOGENESIS AND ETIOLOGY
The	 proposed	 pathogenic	 mechanisms	 of	 SLE	 are	 illustrated	 in

be	 summarized	 as	 leading	 to	 production	 of	 increased	 quantities	 and

FIGURE 356-1  Pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Pathogenesis is related in large part to production of increased quantities and immunogenic forms of 
nucleic acids and other self-antigens, which drive autoimmune-inducing activation of innate immunity, autoantibodies, and T cells. Interactions between genes, environment, 
and epigenetic changes drive increased autophagy, antigen (Ag) presentation, neutrophil NETosis, autoantibody formation with increased plasma cells, and production 
of pathogenic effector T cells in TH1, TH17, and Tfh subsets, and in B-cell subsets with ineffective regulatory networks. Genes confirmed in more than one genome-wide 
association analysis in multiple racial groups that increase susceptibility to SLE or lupus nephritis (HR ≥1.5) are listed (reviewed in Deng Y, Tsao B: Genetics of Human SLE, 
in Dubois Lupus Erythematosus and Related Syndromes, 9th ed. DJ Wallace, BH Hahn [eds]. Philadelphia, Elsevier, 2019, pp 54-69; and Teruel M, Alarcon-Riquelme ME: The 
genetic basis of systemic lupus erythematosus: What are the risk factors and what have we learned. J Autoimmun 74:161, 2016. Epigenetics are reviewed in Richardson  
B: The interaction between environmental triggers and epigenetics in autoimmunity. Clin Immunol 192:1, 2018; and Scharer CD et al: Epigenetic programming underpins B cell 
dysfunction in human SLE. Nat Immunol 20:1071, 2019. Environmental triggers are reviewed in Gulati G, Brunner HI: Environmental triggers in systemic lupus erythematosus. 
Semin Arthritis Rheum 47:710, 2018). These result in abnormal immune responses that generate pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes that deposit in tissue, 
activate  complement,  induce  cytokine  and  chemokine  release  causing  inflammation,  and  over  time  lead  to  irreversible  organ  damage  (reviewed  in  Arazi  A  et  al:  The 
immune cell landscape in kidneys of patients with lupus nephritis. Nat Immunol 20:902, 2019; and Hahn BH: Pathogenesis of SLE, in Dubois Lupus Erythematosus and Related 
Syndromes, 9th ed. DJ Wallace, BH Hahn [eds]. Philadelphia, Elsevier, 2019; and Anders HJ, Rovin B: A pathophysiology-based approach to diagnosis and treatment of

immunogenic	 forms	 of	 nucleic	 acids,	 their	 accompanying	 proteins,	
and	 other	 self-antigens,	 with	 resultant	 stimulation	 of	 large	 quantities	
of	 autoantibodies.	 Autoantibodies	 of	 SLE	 are	 described	 in	 Fig.	 356-1	
and	Table 356-1.

SLE	 autoimmunity	 may	 begin	 with	 activation	 of	 innate	 immu-
nity,	partly	through	binding	of	DNA,	RNA,	and	proteins	by	Toll-like	
receptors	 in	 plasmacytoid	 dendritic	 cells	 (pDCs)	 and	 monocytes/
macrophages.	The	pDCs	(and	other	cells)	produce	interferon	(IFN)	α.	
Upregulation	of	genes	induced	by	IFNs	(particularly	IFN-α)	is	a	genetic	
“signature”	in	whole	blood,	peripheral	blood	cells,	skin	lesions,	syno-
vium,	and	kidneys	in	50–80%	of	SLE	patients	and	is	particularly	associ-
ated	with	active	disease.	Activated	macrophages	produce	inflammatory	
cytokines/chemokines	 such	 as	 interleukin	 (IL)	 12,	 tumor	 necrosis	
factor	α	(TNF-α),	and	the	B-cell	maturation/survival	factor	BLys/BAFF.	
Furthermore,	 lupus	 phagocytic	 cells	 have	 reduced	 capacity	 to	 clear	
immune	complexes,	apoptotic	cells,	and	their	autoantigen-containing	
(e.g.,	 DNA/RNA/Ro/La	 and	 phospholipid)	 surface	 blebs.	 The	 result	
is	 persistence	 of	 large	 quantities	 of	 autoantigens.	 Neutrophils	 release	
immunogenic	 DNA/protein-containing	 neutrophil	 extracellular	 traps	
(NETs),	and	natural	killer	(NK)	cells	have	reduced	ability	to	kill	auto-
reactive	T	and	B	cells	or	to	produce	the	transforming	growth	factor	β	
(TGF-β)	needed	for	development	of	regulatory	T	cells.

The	activated	innate	immune	system	interacts	with	various	subsets	
of	the	B	and	T	cells	of	adaptive	immunity.	SLE	peripheral	B	cells	have	
increased	 numbers	 of	 naïve	 activated	 B	 cells	 and	 double-negative		
B	cells	(DN2:	CD27–CD11c+T-BET+CXCR5–),	which	are	precursors	

of	autoantibody-secreting	cells.	Both	subsets	have	abnormal	epigenetic	
modifications	 with	 more	 open	 chromatin	 than	 normal	 B	 cells	 and	
thus	are	subject	to	hyperactivation	via	their	B-cell	receptors,	Toll-like	
receptor	7	(TLR7),	and	cytokines	such	as	IL-21.	Therefore,	SLE	B	cells	
are	poised	to	react	to	their	environment	with	increased	autoantibody	
secretion.	 Central	 B	 cells	 (germinal	 center,	 follicular	 B	 cells)	 also	
produce	 autoantibodies.	 DN2	 and	 isotype-switched	 memory	 B	 cells	
differentiate	 into	 both	 short-lived	 (in	 periphery)	 and	 long-lived	 (in	
bone	marrow)	plasma	cells	that	secrete	autoantibodies	and	are	elevated	
in	patients	with	active	SLE.	B	cells	not	only	present	antigens,	but	they	
also	secrete	IL-6	and	IL-10,	which	promote	autoreactive	B-cell	survival	
(as	 does	 estrogen).	 Some	 B	 and	 T	 lymphocyte	 subsets	 have	 altered	
metabolism	 (abnormal	 mitochondrial	 electron	 transport,	 membrane	
potential,	and	oxidative	stress),	increased	glucose	utilization,	increased	
pyruvate	 production,	 activation	 of	 mechanistic	 target	 of	 rapamycin	
(mTOR),	and	increased	autophagy.	Helper	T	cells	are	easily	activated	
and	driven	into	either	differentiation,	activation,	or	apoptosis.	In	SLE	
patients,	after	peptides	bind	the	T-cell	receptor	(TCR),	T-cell	signaling	
is	 abnormal,	 beginning	 with	 complexing	 of	 TCR	 with	 the	 common	
chain	FcRγ	rather	than	the	usual	CD3ζ.	This	results	in	abnormal	ele-
vations	of	phosphorylated	Syk,	the	P13K/mTORC	pathway,	CaMKIV,	
PP2A,	and	calcineurin,	with	resultant	increased	calcium	influx.	Rho-	
associated	protein	kinases	(ROCK)	pathways	are	also	elevated,	prob-
ably	via	cytokine	receptors,	with	increases	in	STAT3	and	therefore	in	
IL-17.	The	net	result	is	underproduction	of	IL-2	(needed	for	survival	of	
T	lymphocytes	and	for	generation	of	regulatory	T	cells)	and	elevation

Present in 63% of lupus nephritis, associated with active lupus nephritis especially 
when anti-dsDNA is also present. Correlates with activity of nephritis. Not specific 
for SLE.
Specific for SLE; no definite clinical correlations; most patients also have anti-RNP; 
more common in blacks and Asians than whites
Not specific for SLE; high titers associated with syndromes that have overlap 
features of several rheumatic syndromes including SLE; more common in blacks 
than whites; correlates with high IFN-induced gene signature
Not specific for SLE; associated with sicca syndrome, predisposes to subacute

of	 IL-17.	 These	 changes	 push	 the	 adaptive	 immune	 system	 toward	
generation	of	helper	T	cells	(TH1,	Tfh,	TH17)	and	away	from	downreg-
ulating	regulatory	T	cells.	Several	of	these	B-	and	T-cell	pathways	are	
targets	of	therapeutic	interventions	in	current	clinical	trials.

Tissue	 damage	 begins	 with	 deposition	 of	 autoantibodies	 and/or	
immune	complexes,	followed	by	destruction	mediated	by	complement	
activation	 and	 release	 of	 cytokines/chemokines.	 Nonimmune	 tissue-
fixed	cells	also	are	activated	with	resultant	inflammation	and	damage,	
such	as	basal	cells	of	the	dermis,	synovial	fibroblasts,	renal	mesangial	
cells,	podocytes	and	tubular	epithelium,	and	endothelial	cells	through-
out	the	body.	Meanwhile,	the	initial	immune	attack	is	attracting	into	
the	 target	 tissues	 additional	 B	 and	 T	 cells,	 monocytes/macrophages,	
dendritic	 cells,	 and	 plasma	 cells.	 Inflammation	 also	 causes	 release	 of	
vasoactive	 peptides,	 oxidative	 damage,	 and	 release	 of	 growth	 factors	
and	fibrosing	factors.	Sclerosis/fibrosis	with	irreversible	tissue	damage	
can	occur	in	multiple	tissues	including	kidneys,	lungs,	blood	vessels,	
and	skin.	Each	of	these	processes	depends	on	the	individual’s	genetic	
background,	environmental	influences,	and	epigenetics.

SLE	is	usually	a	multigenic	disease.	Rare	single-gene	defects	confer	
high	 hazard	 ratios	 (HRs)	 for	 SLE	 (HR	 5–25),	 including	 homozygous	
deficiencies	of	early	components	of	complement	(C1q,r,s;	C2;	C4)	and	
a	 mutation	 in	 TREX1	 (encoding	 a	 DNAase)	 on	 the	 X	 chromosome.	
In	most	genetically	susceptible	individuals,	normal	alleles,	mutations,	
and/or	 copy	 numbers	 of	 multiple	 ancestral	 genes	 each	 contribute	 a	
small	 amount	 to	 abnormal	 immune/inflammation/tissue	 damage	
responses;	 if	 enough	 predisposing	 variations	 are	 present,	 disease	
results.	 Approximately	 90	 genes	 with	 normal	 single	 nucleotide	 poly-
morphisms	 (SNPs;	 or	 mutations	 or	 altered	 copy	 numbers)	 increase	
risk	 for	 SLE	 and/or	 clinical	 subsets	 of	 SLE	 and/or	 irreversible	 organ	
damage.	They	have	been	identified	in	recent	genome-wide	or	immu-
nochip	 association	 studies	 in	 different	 ancestries.	 Individually,	 they	

confer	 an	 HR	 for	 SLE	 of	 1.4–3	 and,	 even	 in	 combination,	 account	
for	 only	 28%	 of	 disease	 susceptibility,	 suggesting	 that	 environmental	
exposures	and	epigenetics	play	major	roles.	Examples	are	listed	in	Fig.	
356-1,	showing	those	with	HR	≥1.4	and	listing	them	according	to	their	
major	 known	 functions.	 Approximately	 50%	 of	 known	 predisposing	
genes	influence	IFN	production	or	function—the	most	characteristic	
increased	gene	expression	pattern	of	SLE	patients.	Multiple	genes	affect	
final	responses:	for	example,	a	gene	effect	in	the	promoter	for	IRF5	that	
increases	IFN	production	is	associated	with	SLE	in	all	ancestries,	but	a	
haplotype	containing	IRF5	and	transportin	3	(TNPO3),	which	probably	
further	increases	IFN	responses,	is	present	only	in	European	ancestries.	
Some	polymorphisms	influence	clinical	manifestations;	these	are	listed	
in	Fig.	356-1.	Some	genes	relate	to	end-organ	dysfunction	rather	than	
SLE,	 such	 as	 MYH9/APOL1	 associating	 with	 end-stage	 renal	 disease	
(ESRD)	in	all	ancestries,	whereas	APOL1G1/G2	associates	with	ESRD	
(but	not	SLE)	only	in	African	Americans.	Such	combinations	probably	
account	for	lupus	nephritis	being	more	common	and	more	severe	in	
African	Americans	than	in	other	races.	Some	gene	effects	are	in	promoter	
regions	(e.g.,	MYH9/APOL	and	IL-10),	and	others	are	conferred	by	copy	
numbers	 (e.g.,	 C4A,  TLR7).	 In	 addition,	 multiple	 epigenetic	 changes	
characterize	 SLE,	 including	 hypomethylation	 of	 DNA-encoding	 genes,	
promoter	regions,	and/or	transcription	factors	in	CD4+	T	cells,	B	cells,	
and	monocytes,	e.g.,	genes	that	control	production	of	type	1	IFNs.	In	
contrast,	some	DNA	regions	in	SLE	B	cells	are	hypermethylated.	There	
are	 also	 histone	 modifications	 in	 SLE	 DNA.	 Some	 of	 these	 changes	
are	mediated	by	microRNAs	associated	with	SLE,	including	some	that	
control	DNA	methyltransferases	(DNMTs;	such	as	mIR-146a),	which	
control	methylation	of	DNA	in	CD4+	T	cells	and	resultant	IFN	pro-
duction.	Some	gene	polymorphisms	contribute	to	several	autoimmune	
diseases,	 such	 as	 STAT4	 and	 CTLA4.	 Most	 of	 these	 genetic	 effects	
influence	immune	responses	to	the	external	and	internal	environment;

when	such	responses	are	abnormal	or	prolonged,	autoimmune	disease	
is	favored.

Female	sex	is	permissive	for	SLE	with	evidence	for	hormone	effects,	
genes	on	the	X	chromosome,	and	epigenetic	differences	between	gen-
ders	playing	a	role.	Females	of	many	mammalian	species	make	higher	
antibody	responses	than	males.	Women	exposed	to	estrogen-containing	
oral	 contraceptives	 or	 hormone	 replacement	 have	 an	 increased	 risk	
of	developing	SLE	(HR	1.2–2).	Estradiol	binds	to	receptors	on	T	and		
B	lymphocytes,	increasing	activation	and	survival	of	those	cells,	espe-
cially	autoreactive	subsets,	thus	favoring	prolonged	immune	responses.	
Genes	on	the	X	chromosome	that	influence	SLE,	such	as	TREX1,	may	
play	a	role	in	gender	predisposition,	possibly	because	some	genes	on	
the	 second	 X	 in	 females	 are	 not	 silent.	 People	 with	 XXY	 karyotype	
(Klinefelter’s	syndrome)	have	a	significantly	increased	risk	for	SLE.

Several	 environmental	 stimuli	 may	 influence	 SLE	 (Fig.	 356-1).	
Exposure	to	ultraviolet	light	causes	flares	of	SLE	in	~70%	of	patients,	
possibly	by	increasing	apoptosis	in	skin	cells	or	by	altering	DNA	and	
intracellular	 proteins	 to	 make	 them	 antigenic.	 Some	 infections	 and	
lupus-inducing	drugs	activate	autoreactive	T	and	B	cells;	if	such	cells	
are	 not	 appropriately	 regulated,	 prolonged	 autoantibody	 production	
occurs.	 Most	 SLE	 patients	 have	 autoantibodies	 for	 3	 years	 or	 more	
before	 the	 first	 symptoms	 of	 disease,	 suggesting	 that	 regulation	 con-
trols	the	degree	of	autoimmunity	for	years	before	quantities	and	qual-
ities	of	autoantibodies,	activated	innate	immunity,	pathogenic	B	and	T	
cells,	and	activated	tissue-fixed	cells	cause	clinical	disease.	Epstein-Barr	
virus	(EBV)	may	be	one	infectious	agent	that	can	trigger	SLE	in	sus-
ceptible	individuals.	Children	and	adults	with	SLE	are	more	likely	to	be	
infected	by	EBV	than	age-,	sex-,	and	ethnicity-matched	controls.	EBV	
contains	amino	acid	sequences	that	mimic	sequences	on	human	spli-
ceosomes	(RNA/protein	antigens)	often	recognized	by	autoantibodies	
in	 people	 with	 SLE.	 Current	 tobacco	 smoking	 increases	 risk	 for	 SLE	
(HR	 1.5).	 Prolonged	 occupational	 exposure	 to	 crystalline	 silica	 (e.g.,	
inhalation	of	soap	powder	dust	or	soil	in	farming	activities)	increases	
risk	 (HR	 4.3)	 in	 African-American	 women.	 Exposure	 to	 pesticides	
during	childhood,	both	in	residential	use	and	in	farming,	increases	the	
risk	of	SLE.	Long-term	exposure	to	air	pollution	also	increases	the	risk	
of	 SLE.	 Thus,	 interplay	 between	 genetic	 susceptibility,	 environment,	
gender,	race,	and	abnormal	immune	responses	results	in	autoimmunity	
(Chap. 355).

 ■ PATHOLOGY
In	SLE,	biopsies	of	affected	skin	show	deposition	of	Ig	at	the	dermal-	
epidermal	junction	(DEJ),	injury	to	basal	keratinocytes,	and	inflamma-
tion	dominated	by	T	lymphocytes	in	the	DEJ	and	around	blood	vessels	
and	 dermal	 appendages.	 Clinically	 unaffected	 skin	 may	 also	 show	 Ig	
deposition	at	the	DEJ.	Lupus	skin	lesions	are	characterized	by	expres-
sion	 of	 IFN-regulated	 cytokines	 and	 chemokines	 and	 by	 IFN-pro-
ducing	 pDCs	 and	 keratinocytes.	 These	 patterns	 are	 not	 specific	 for	
dermatologic	SLE;	however,	they	are	highly	suggestive.

In	renal	biopsies,	the	pattern	and	severity	of	injury	are	important	in	
diagnosis	and	in	selecting	the	best	therapy.	Most	recent	clinical	studies	of	
lupus	nephritis	have	used	the	International	Society	of	Nephrology	(ISN)	
and	the	Renal	Pathology	Society	(RPS)	classification	(Table 356-2).	In	
the	 ISN/RPS	 classification,	 the	 addition	 of	 “A”	 for	 active	 and	 “C”	 for	
chronic	changes	gives	physicians	information	regarding	the	potential	
reversibility	 of	 disease.	 The	 system	 focuses	 on	 glomerular	 disease,	
although	 the	 presence	 of	 tubular	 interstitial	 and	 vascular	 disease,	 as	
well	 as	 the	 chronicity	 score	 in	 both	 glomeruli	 and	 interstitium,	 is	
important	in	predicting	clinical	outcomes.	In	general,	class	III	and	IV	
disease,	as	well	as	class	V	accompanied	by	III	or	IV	disease,	should	be	
treated	with	aggressive	immunosuppression	if	possible	because	there	is	
a	high	risk	for	ESRD	if	patients	are	untreated	or	undertreated.	In	con-
trast,	treatment	for	lupus	nephritis	is	not	recommended	in	patients	with	
class	I	or	II	disease	or	with	extensive	irreversible	changes	(class	VI).	In	
the	2019	European	League	of	Rheumatism/American	College	of	Rheu-
matology	(EULAR/ACR)	criteria	for	classification	of	SLE,	a	diagnosis	
can	be	established	on	the	basis	of	class	III	or	class	IV	renal	histology	in	
the	presence	of	antinuclear	autoantibodies,	without	meeting	additional	
criteria	(Tables 356-3 and 356-4).

TABLE 356-2  Classification of Lupus Nephritis (International Society 
of Nephrology and Renal Pathology Society)
Class I: Minimal Mesangial Lupus Nephritis

Normal glomeruli by light microscopy, but mesangial immune deposits by 
immunofluorescence.

Class II: Mesangial Proliferative Lupus Nephritis

Purely mesangial hypercellularity of any degree or mesangial matrix expansion 
by light microscopy, with mesangial immune deposits. A few isolated 
subepithelial or subendothelial deposits may be visible by immunofluorescence 
or electron microscopy, but not by light microscopy.

Class III: Focal Lupus Nephritis

Active or inactive focal, segmental or global endo- or extracapillary 
glomerulonephritis involving ≤50% of all glomeruli, typically with focal 
subendothelial immune deposits, with or without mesangial alterations.
  Class III (A): Active lesions—focal proliferative lupus nephritis

 Class III (A/C): Active and chronic lesions—focal proliferative and sclerosing 
lupus nephritis
 Class III (C): Chronic inactive lesions with glomerular scars—focal sclerosing 
lupus nephritis

Class IV: Diffuse Lupus Nephritis

Active or inactive diffuse, segmental or global endo- or extracapillary 
glomerulonephritis involving ≥50% of all glomeruli, typically with diffuse 
subendothelial immune deposits, with or without mesangial alterations. This 
class is divided into diffuse segmental (IV-S) lupus nephritis when ≥50% of 
the involved glomeruli have segmental lesions, and diffuse global (IV-G) lupus 
nephritis when ≥50% of the involved glomeruli have global lesions. Segmental is 
defined as a glomerular lesion that involves less than one-half of the glomerular 
tuft. This class includes cases with diffuse wire loop deposits but with little or no 
glomerular proliferation.
  Class IV-S (A): Active lesions—diffuse segmental proliferative lupus nephritis
  Class IV-G (A): Active lesions—diffuse global proliferative lupus nephritis

 Class IV-S (A/C): Active and chronic lesions—diffuse segmental proliferative 
and sclerosing lupus nephritis
 Class IV-G (A/C): Active and chronic lesions—diffuse global proliferative and 
sclerosing lupus nephritis
 Class IV-S (C): Chronic inactive lesions with scars—diffuse segmental 
sclerosing lupus nephritis
 Class IV-G (C): Chronic inactive lesions with scars—diffuse global sclerosing 
lupus nephritis

Class V: Membranous Lupus Nephritis

Global or segmental subepithelial immune deposits or their morphologic 
sequelae by light microscopy and by immunofluorescence or electron 
microscopy, with or without mesangial alterations. Class V lupus nephritis may 
occur in combination with class III or IV, in which case both will be diagnosed. 
Class V lupus nephritis may show advanced sclerosis.

Class VI: Advanced Sclerotic Lupus Nephritis

≥90% of glomeruli globally sclerosed without residual activity.

Note: Indicate and grade (mild, moderate, severe) tubular atrophy, interstitial 
inflammation and fibrosis, and severity of arteriosclerosis or other vascular lesions.

Histologic	abnormalities	in	blood	vessels	may	also	determine	ther-
apy.	 Patterns	 of	 vasculitis	 are	 not	 specific	 for	 SLE	 but	 may	 indicate	
active	disease:	leukocytoclastic	vasculitis	is	most	common	(Chap. 363).
Lymph	 node	 biopsies	 are	 usually	 performed	 to	 rule	 out	 infec-
tion	 or	 malignancies.	 In	 SLE,	 they	 show	 nonspecific	 diffuse	 chronic	
inflammation.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	 diagnosis	 of	 SLE	 is	 based	 on	 characteristic	 clinical	 features	 and	
autoantibodies.	 Two	 classification	 systems	 are	 currently	 in	 use:	 the	
2012	 Systemic	 Lupus	 International	 Collaborating	 Clinics	 (SLICC)	
criteria	 and	 the	 2019	 EULAR/ACR	 classification	 in	 which	 clinical	
manifestations	are	weighted.	Both	are	shown	in	Tables	356-3	and	356-4.		
The	 SLICC	 criteria	 are	 easier	 for	 evaluating	 an	 individual	 patient,	
but	the	EULAR/ACR	are	more	current	and	will	probably	be	used	for

aRenal biopsy read as systemic lupus qualifies for classification as SLE if any lupus 
autoantibodies are present, even if total criteria are fewer than 4.
Interpretation: Presence of any four criteria (must have at least 1 in each category) 
qualifies patient to be classified as having SLE with 93% specificity and 92% 
sensitivity. American College of Rheumatology is developing new criteria for SLE.

most	 clinical	 studies	 in	 SLE	 for	 the	 next	 several	 years.	 An	 algorithm	
for	 diagnosis	 and	 initial	 therapy	 is	 shown	 in	 Fig. 356-2.	 The	 criteria	
are	intended	for	diagnosis	of	SLE	in	subjects	included	in	studies;	the	
authors	use	them	in	individual	patients	for	estimating	the	probability	
that	a	disease	is	SLE.	In	the	SLICC	criteria,	any	combination	of	four	
or	 more	 well-documented	 criteria	 at	 any	 time	 during	 an	 individual’s	
history,	with	at	least	one	in	the	clinical	and	one	in	the	immunologic	
category,	makes	it	likely	that	the	patient	has	SLE	(specificity	97%,	sensi-
tivity	84%%).	For	EULAR/ACR	criteria,	a	subject	must	have	a	positive	
ANA	 (≥1:80	 by	 immunofluorescence)	 and	 a	 score	 of	 10	 (specificity	
97%,	sensitivity	93%).	In	many	patients,	criteria	accrue	over	time.	Anti-
nuclear	antibodies	(ANAs)	are	positive	in	>98%	of	patients	during	the	
course	of	disease;	repeated	negative	tests	by	immunofluorescent	meth-
ods	suggest	that	the	diagnosis	is	not	SLE,	unless	other	autoantibodies	
are	present	(Fig.	356-2).	High-titer	IgG	antibodies	to	double-stranded	
DNA	and	antibodies	to	the	Sm	antigen	are	both	specific	for	SLE	and,	
therefore,	 favor	 the	 diagnosis	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 compatible	 clinical	
manifestations.	The	presence	of	multiple	autoantibodies	in	an	individ-
ual	without	clinical	symptoms	should	not	be	considered	diagnostic	for	
SLE,	although	such	persons	are	at	increased	risk.

 ■ OVERVIEW AND SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATIONS
At	its	onset,	SLE	may	involve	one	or	several	organ	systems;	over	time,	
additional	manifestations	may	occur	(Tables	356-3,	356-4,	and	356-5).	
Most	 of	 the	 autoantibodies	 characteristic	 of	 each	 person	 are	 present	
at	 the	 time	 clinical	 manifestations	 appear	 (Tables	 356-1,	 356-3,	 and	
356-4).	 Severity	 of	 SLE	 varies	 from	 mild	 and	 intermittent	 to	 severe	
and	fulminant.	Systemic	symptoms,	particularly	fatigue	and	myalgias/	
arthralgias,	are	present	most	of	the	time.	Severe	systemic	illness	requir-
ing	high-dose	glucocorticoid	therapy	can	occur	with	fever,	prostration,	
weight	loss,	and	anemia	with	or	without	other	organ-targeted	manifes-
tations.	 Approximately	 85%	 of	 patients	 have	 either	 continuing	 active	
disease	(on	current	treatment)	or	one	or	more	flares	of	active	disease	
annually.	Permanent	complete	remissions	(absence	of	symptoms	with	
no	treatment)	occur	in	<5%.	Recommended	treatment	target	is	remis-
sion	on	therapy	(no	clinical	manifestations;	abnormal	laboratory	tests	
permitted)	or	induction	of	low	lupus	disease	activity.	See	“Management	
of	Systemic	Lupus	Erythematosus,”	below,	for	more	detail.

 ■ MUSCULOSKELETAL MANIFESTATIONS
Most	 people	 with	 SLE	 have	 intermittent	 polyarthritis,	 varying	 from	
mild	to	disabling.	Polyarthritis	is	characterized	by	soft	tissue	swelling	
and	 tenderness	 in	 joints	 and/or	 tendons,	 most	 commonly	 in	 hands,	
wrists,	 and	 knees.	 Joint	 deformities	 (hands	 and	 feet)	 develop	 in	 only	
10%	and	are	often	reducible.	Erosions	on	joint	x-rays	are	rare	but	can	
be	 identified	 by	 ultrasound	 in	 10–50%	 of	 patients;	 individuals	 with	
erosions	 may	 fulfill	 criteria	 for	 both	 RA	 and	 SLE	 (“rhupus”).	 If	 pain	
persists	in	a	single	joint,	such	as	knee,	shoulder,	or	hip,	a	diagnosis	of	
ischemic	 necrosis	 of	 bone	 (INB)	 should	 be	 considered,	 particularly	
if	 there	 are	 no	 other	 manifestations	 of	 active	 SLE.	 INB	 prevalence	 is	
increased	 in	 SLE,	 especially	 in	 patients	 treated	 with	 systemic	 gluco-
corticoids.	 Myositis	 with	 clinical	 muscle	 weakness,	 elevated	 creatine	
kinase	 levels,	 positive	 magnetic	 resonance	 imaging	 (MRI)	 scan,	 and	
muscle	necrosis	and	inflammation	on	biopsy	can	occur,	although	most	
patients	 have	 myalgias	 without	 frank	 myositis.	 Glucocorticoid	 thera-
pies	(commonly)	and	antimalarial	therapies	(rarely)	can	cause	muscle	
weakness;	 these	 adverse	 effects	 must	 be	 distinguished	 from	 active	
inflammatory	disease.

 ■ CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS
Lupus	 dermatitis	 can	 be	 classified	 as	 acute,	 subacute,	 or	 chronic,	 and	
there	 are	 many	 different	 types	 of	 lesions	 encompassed	 within	 these	
groups.	 Discoid	 lupus	 erythematosus	 (DLE)	 is	 the	 most	 common	
chronic	 dermatitis	 in	 lupus;	 lesions	 are	 roughly	 circular	 with	 slightly	
raised,	 scaly,	 hyperpigmented	 erythematous	 rims	 and	 depigmented,	
atrophic	 centers	 in	 which	 all	 dermal	 appendages	 are	 permanently	
destroyed.	Lesions	can	be	disfiguring,	particularly	on	the	face	and	scalp.	
Only	 5%	 of	 people	 with	 DLE	 have	 SLE	 (although	 half	 have	 positive	
ANA);	however,	among	individuals	with	SLE,	as	many	as	20%	have	DLE.	
The	 most	 common	 acute	 SLE	 rash	 is	 a	 photosensitive,	 slightly	 raised,	
occasionally	 scaly	 erythema	 on	 the	 face	 (particularly	 the	 cheeks	 and	
nose—the	“butterfly”	rash),	ears,	chin,	V	region	of	the	neck	and	chest,	
upper	back,	and	extensor	surfaces	of	the	arms.	Worsening	of	this	rash	
often	accompanies	flare	of	systemic	disease.	Subacute	cutaneous	lupus	
erythematosus	(SCLE)	consists	of	scaly	red	patches,	similar	to	psoriasis,	
or	 circular,	 flat,	 red-rimmed	 (“annular”)	 lesions.	 Patients	 with	 these	
manifestations	 are	 exquisitely	 photosensitive;	 most	 have	 antibodies	 to	
Ro	(SS-A).	Other	SLE	rashes	include	recurring	urticaria,	lichen	planus–
like	dermatitis,	bullae,	and	panniculitis	(“lupus	profundus”).	Rashes	can	
be	minor	or	severe;	they	may	be	the	major	disease	manifestation.	Small	
ulcerations	on	the	oral	or	nasal	mucosa	are	common	in	SLE;	the	lesions	
resemble	aphthous	ulcers	and	may	or	may	not	be	painful.

INTERPRETATION OF CLINICAL 
MANIFESTATIONS
When	a	diagnosis	of	SLE	is	made,	it	is	important	to	establish	the	severity	
and	potential	reversibility	of	the	illness	and	to	estimate	the	possible	con-
sequences	 of	 various	 therapeutic	 interventions.	 In	 the	 following	 para-
graphs,	descriptions	of	some	disease	manifestations	begin	with	relatively	
mild	problems	and	progress	to	those	that	are	more	life-threatening.

 ■ RENAL MANIFESTATIONS
Nephritis	is	usually	the	most	serious	manifestation	of	SLE,	particularly	
because	 nephritis	 and	 infection	 are	 the	 leading	 causes	 of	 mortality	
in	 the	 first	 decade	 of	 disease.	 Because	 nephritis	 is	 asymptomatic	 in	
most	 lupus	 patients,	 urinalysis	 should	 be	 ordered	 in	 any	 person	 sus-
pected	of	having	SLE.	The	classification	of	lupus	nephritis	is	primarily	
histologic	 (see	 “Pathology,”	 above,	 and	 Table	 356-2).	 Renal	 biopsy

is	 recommended	 for	 every	 SLE	 patient	 with	 any	 clinical	 evidence	 of	
nephritis;	results	are	used	to	plan	current	therapies	and	their	duration.	
Patients	with	dangerous	proliferative	forms	of	glomerular	damage	(ISN	
III	and	IV)	usually	have	microscopic	hematuria	and	proteinuria	(>500	
mg	 per	 24	 h);	 approximately	 one-half	 develop	 nephrotic	 syndrome,	
and	most	develop	hypertension.	Overall,	in	the	United	States,	~20%	of	
individuals	with	lupus	diffuse	proliferative	glomerulonephritis	(DPGN)	
die	 or	 develop	 ESRD	 within	 10	 years	 of	 diagnosis.	 Such	 individuals	
require	 aggressive	 control	 of	 SLE	 and	 of	 the	 complications	 of	 renal	
disease	and	of	therapy	unless	damage	is	irreversible	(Fig.	356-2,	Table 
356-6).	African	Americans,	Hispanics,	and	Asians/Pacific	Islanders	are	
more	likely	to	develop	nephritis	than	Caucasians.	African	Americans	
are	more	likely	to	develop	ESRD	than	are	whites,	even	with	the	most	
current	therapies.	Approximately	20%	of	SLE	patients	with	proteinuria	
(usually	 nephrotic)	 have	 membranous	 glomerular	 changes	 without	
proliferative	changes	on	renal	biopsy.	Their	outcome	is	better	than	for	
those	with	DPGN,	but	patients	with	class	V	and	nephrotic	range	pro-
teinuria	should	be	treated	in	the	same	way	as	those	with	classes	III	or	
IV	proliferative	disease.	Lupus	nephritis	is	usually	an	ongoing	disease,	
with	 flares	 requiring	 re-treatment	 or	 increased	 treatment	 over	 many	
years.	For	most	people	with	lupus	nephritis,	accelerated	atherosclerosis	
becomes	 important	 after	 several	 years	 of	 disease;	 attention	 must	 be	
given	to	control	of	systemic	inflammation,	blood	pressure,	hyperlipi-
demia,	and	hyperglycemia.

 ■ NERVOUS SYSTEM MANIFESTATIONS
There	 are	 many	 central	 nervous	 system	 (CNS)	 and	 peripheral	 ner-
vous	 system	 manifestations	 of	 SLE;	 in	 some	 patients,	 these	 are	 the	

major	 cause	 of	 morbidity	 and	 mortality.	 It	 is	 useful	 to	 approach	 this	
diagnostically	 by	 asking	 first	 whether	 the	 symptoms	 result	 from	 SLE	
or	 another	 condition	 (such	 as	 infection	 in	 immunosuppressed	 indi-
viduals	 or	 side	 effects	 of	 therapies).	 If	 symptoms	 are	 related	 to	 SLE,	
it	should	be	determined	whether	they	are	caused	by	a	diffuse	process	
(requiring	immunosuppression)	or	vascular	occlusive	disease	(requir-
ing	anticoagulation).	The	most	common	manifestation	of	diffuse	CNS	
lupus	is	cognitive	dysfunction,	including	difficulties	with	memory	and	
reasoning.	Headaches	are	also	common.	When	excruciating,	they	often	
indicate	SLE	flare;	when	milder,	they	are	difficult	to	distinguish	from	
migraine	or	tension	headaches.	Seizures	of	any	type	may	be	caused	by	
lupus;	treatment	often	requires	both	antiseizure	and	immunosuppres-
sive	 therapies.	 Psychosis	 can	 be	 the	 dominant	 manifestation	 of	 SLE;	
it	must	be	distinguished	from	glucocorticoid-induced	psychosis.	The	
latter	usually	occurs	in	the	first	weeks	of	glucocorticoid	therapy,	at	daily	
doses	of	≥40	mg	of	prednisone	or	equivalent;	psychosis	resolves	over	
several	days	after	glucocorticoids	are	decreased	or	stopped.	Myelopa-
thy	is	often	disabling;	rapid	initiation	of	immunosuppressive	therapy	
including	high-dose	glucocorticoids	is	standard	of	care.

 ■ VASCULAR OCCLUSIONS INCLUDING STROKE 
AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTIONS
The	prevalence	of	transient	ischemic	attacks,	strokes,	and	myocardial	
infarctions	 is	 increased	 in	 patients	 with	 SLE.	 These	 vascular	 events	
are	increased	in,	but	not	exclusive	to,	SLE	patients	with	antibodies	to	
phospholipids	(antiphospholipid	antibodies)	(Chap. 357).	Ischemia	in	
the	 brain	 can	 be	 caused	 by	 focal	 occlusion	 (either	 noninflammatory	
or	 associated	 with	 vasculitis)	 or	 by	 embolization	 from	 carotid	 artery

ate	 tests	 for	 antiphospholipid	 antibodies	 (see	 below)	 and	 for	 sources	
of	 emboli	 should	 be	 ordered	 in	 such	 patients	 to	 estimate	 the	 need	
for,	 intensity	 of,	 and	 duration	 of	 anti-inflammatory	 and/or	 antico-
agulant	therapies.	When	it	is	most	likely	that	a	cerebral	event	results	
from	 clotting,	 long-term	 anticoagulation	 is	 the	 therapy	 of	 choice.

dyslipidemia,	 diabetes,	 dysfunctional	 proinflammatory	 high-density	
lipoproteins,	high	disease	activity,	high	glucocorticoid	dose,	and	high	
serum	 homocysteine	 and	 leptin.	 Statin	 therapies	 reduce	 levels	 of	
low-density	lipoproteins	(LDL)	in	SLE	patients;	significant	reduction	
of	all-cause	mortality	by	statins	has	been	shown	in	SLE	patients	with	
renal	transplants	and	in	an	epidemiologic	study	of	a	large	number	of	
patients	in	Taiwan.

 ■ PULMONARY MANIFESTATIONS
The	most	common	pulmonary	manifestation	of	SLE	is	pleuritis	with	or	
without	pleural	effusion.	This	manifestation,	when	mild,	may	respond	
to	 treatment	 with	 nonsteroidal	 anti-inflammatory	 drugs	 (NSAIDs);

when	 more	 severe,	 patients	 require	 a	 brief	 course	 of	 glucocorticoid	
therapy.	Pulmonary	infiltrates	also	occur	as	a	manifestation	of	active	
SLE	and	are	difficult	to	distinguish	from	infection	on	imaging	studies.	
Life-threatening	pulmonary	manifestations	include	interstitial	inflam-
mation	 leading	 to	 fibrosis	 (histologic	 pattern	 mimics	 usual	 diffuse	
interstitial	pneumonitis),	shrinking	lung	syndrome,	and	intra-alveolar	
hemorrhage;	 all	 of	 these	 probably	 require	 early	 aggressive	 immuno-
suppressive	 therapy	 as	 well	 as	 supportive	 care.	 Pulmonary	 arterial	
hypertension	occurs	in	a	small	proportion	of	SLE	patients	and	should	
be	treated	in	the	same	way	as	idiopathic	pulmonary	hypertension.

 ■ CARDIAC MANIFESTATIONS
Pericarditis	 is	 the	 most	 frequent	 cardiac	 manifestation;	 it	 usually	
responds	 to	 anti-inflammatory	 therapy	 and	 infrequently	 leads	 to	
tamponade.	More	serious	cardiac	manifestations	are	myocarditis	and	
fibrinous	 endocarditis	 of	 Libman-Sacks.	 Myocardial	 inflammation	
can	 be	 associated	 with	 left	 ventricular	 dysfunction	 and	 heart	 failure.	
Overall,	lupus	patients	have	a	2.7-fold	higher	risk	of	developing	heart	
failure	 compared	 with	 the	 general	 population.	 Arrhythmias	 are	 fre-
quent.	 Endocardial	 involvement	 can	 lead	 to	 valvular	 insufficiencies,	
most	commonly	of	the	mitral	or	aortic	valves,	or	to	embolic	events.	It	
has	not	been	proven	that	glucocorticoid	or	other	immunosuppressive	
therapies	 lead	 to	 improvement	 of	 lupus	 myocarditis	 or	 endocarditis,	
but	it	is	usual	practice	to	administer	a	trial	of	high-dose	steroids	along	
with	 appropriate	 supportive	 therapy	 for	 heart	 failure,	 arrhythmia,	 or	
embolic	events.	As	discussed	above,	patients	with	SLE	are	at	increased	
risk	for	myocardial	infarction,	usually	due	to	accelerated	atherosclero-
sis,	which	probably	results	from	immune	attack,	chronic	inflammation,	
and/or	chronic	oxidative	damage	to	arteries.

 ■ HEMATOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS
The	most	frequent	hematologic	manifestation	of	SLE	is	anemia,	usually	
normochromic	normocytic,	reflecting	chronic	illness	and	consequent	
impaired	 utilization	 of	 iron.	 Hemolysis	 can	 be	 rapid	 in	 onset	 and	
severe,	 requiring	 high-dose	 glucocorticoid	 therapy.	 Leukopenia	 is	
also	 common	 and	 almost	 always	 consists	 of	 lymphopenia,	 not	 gran-
ulocytopenia;	 lymphopenia	 rarely	 predisposes	 to	 infections	 and	 by	
itself	 usually	 does	 not	 require	 therapy.	 Thrombocytopenia	 may	 be	 a	
recurring	 problem.	 If	 platelet	 counts	 are	 >40,000/μL	 and	 abnormal	
bleeding	is	absent,	therapy	may	not	be	required.	High-dose	glucocor-
ticoid	 therapy	 (e.g.,	 1	 mg/kg	 per	 day	 of	 prednisone	 or	 equivalent)	 is	
usually	effective	for	the	first	few	episodes	of	severe	thrombocytopenia.	
Recurring	 or	 prolonged	 hemolytic	 anemia	 or	 thrombocytopenia,	 or	
disease	requiring	an	unacceptably	high	dose	of	daily	glucocorticoids,	
should	be	treated	with	additional	strategies	such	as	rituximab,	platelet	
growth	 factors,	 and/or	 splenectomy	 (see	 “Management	 of	 Systemic	
Lupus	Erythematosus”	below).

 ■ GASTROINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS
Nausea,	sometimes	with	vomiting,	and	diarrhea	can	be	manifestations	
of	an	SLE	flare.	Diffuse	abdominal	pain	can	be	caused	by	autoimmune	
peritonitis	 and/or	 intestinal	 vasculitis.	 Increases	 in	 serum	 aspar-
tate	 aminotransferase	 (AST)	 and	 alanine	 aminotransferase	 (ALT)		
are	common	when	SLE	is	active.	These	manifestations	usually	improve	
promptly	during	systemic	glucocorticoid	therapy.	Vasculitis	involving	
the	intestine	can	be	life-threatening;	perforations,	ischemia,	bleeding,	
and	sepsis	are	frequent	complications.	Aggressive	immunosuppressive	
therapy	 with	 high-dose	 glucocorticoids	 is	 recommended	 for	 short-
term	 control;	 evidence	 of	 recurrence	 is	 an	 indication	 for	 additional	
immunosuppression.

 ■ OCULAR MANIFESTATIONS
Sicca	syndrome	(Sjögren’s	syndrome;	Chap. 361)	and	nonspecific	con-
junctivitis	are	common	in	SLE	and	rarely	threaten	vision.	In	contrast,	
retinal	 vasculitis	 and	 optic	 neuritis	 are	 serious	 manifestations:	 blind-
ness	can	develop	over	days	to	weeks.	Aggressive	immunosuppression	
is	recommended,	although	there	are	no	controlled	trials	to	prove	effec-
tiveness.	 Complications	 of	 systemic	 and	 intraorbital	 glucocorticoid	
therapy	include	cataracts	(common)	and	glaucoma.

aNumbers indicate percentage of patients who have the manifestation at some time 
during the course of illness.
Abbreviations: ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; SLE, systemic lupus 
erythematosus; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

LABORATORY TESTS
Laboratory	tests	serve	(1)	to	establish	or	rule	out	the	diagnosis;	(2)	to	
follow	the	course	of	disease	and,	in	particular,	to	suggest	that	a	flare	is	
occurring	or	organ	damage	is	developing;	and	(3)	to	identify	adverse	
effects	of	therapies.
 ■ TESTS FOR AUTOANTIBODIES (TABLES 356-1  
AND 356-3)
Diagnostically,	the	most	important	autoantibodies	are	ANA	because	the	
test	is	positive	in	>95%	of	patients,	usually	at	the	onset	of	symptoms.	A	
few	 patients	 develop	 ANA	 within	 1	 year	 of	 symptom	 onset;	 repeated	
testing	 may	 thus	 be	 useful.	 ANA	 tests	 using	 immunofluorescent	
methods	are	more	reliable	than	enzyme-linked	immunosorbent	assays	
(ELISAs)	and/or	bead	assays,	which	have	less	specificity.	ANA-negative	
lupus	 exists	 but	 is	 rare	 in	 adults	 and	 is	 usually	 associated	 with	 other	
autoantibodies	 (anti-Ro	 or	 anti-DNA).	 High-titer	 IgG	 antibodies	 to	
double-stranded	 DNA	 (dsDNA)	 (but	 not	 to	 single-stranded	 DNA)	 are	
specific	 for	 SLE.	 ELISA	 and	 immunofluorescent	 reactions	 of	 sera	 with	
the	 dsDNA	 in	 the	 flagellate	 Crithidia  luciliae	 have	 ~60%	 sensitivity	 for	
SLE.	 Titers	 of	 anti-dsDNA	 vary	 over	 time.	 In	 some	 patients,	 increases	
in	 quantities	 of	 anti-dsDNA	 herald	 a	 flare,	 particularly	 of	 nephritis	 or	
vasculitis,	and	especially	when	associated	with	declining	levels	of	C3	or	
C4	 complement.	 Antibodies	 to	 Sm	 are	 also	 specific	 for	 SLE	 and	 assist	
in	 diagnosis;	 anti-Sm	 antibodies	 do	 not	 usually	 correlate	 with	 disease	
activity	 or	 clinical	 manifestations.	 Antiphospholipid	 antibodies	 are	 not	
specific	 for	 SLE,	 but	 their	 presence	 fulfills	 one	 classification	 criterion,	
and	they	identify	patients	at	increased	risk	for	venous	or	arterial	clotting,	
thrombocytopenia,	and	fetal	loss.	There	are	three	widely	accepted	tests	
that	 measure	 different	 antibodies	 (anticardiolipin,	 anti-β2-glycopro-
tein,	 and	 the	 lupus	 anticoagulant).	 ELISA	 is	 used	 for	 anticardiolipin	
and	anti-β2-glycoprotein	(both	internationally	standardized	with	good	
reproducibility);	 a	 sensitive	 phospholipid-based	 activated	 prothrombin	
time	such	as	the	dilute	Russell	venom	viper	test	is	used	to	identify	the	
lupus	anticoagulant.	The	higher	the	titers	of	IgG	anticardiolipin	(>40	IU	
is	considered	high),	and	the	greater	the	number	of	different	antiphos-
pholipid	antibodies	that	are	detected,	the	greater	is	the	risk	for	a	clinical	
episode	of	clotting.	Quantities	of	antiphospholipid	antibodies	may	vary	
markedly	over	time;	repeated	testing	is	justified	if	clinical	manifestations	
of	the	antiphospholipid	syndrome	(APS)	appear	(Chap. 357).	To	classify	
a	patient	as	having	APS,	with	or	without	SLE,	by	international	criteria	
requires	the	presence	of	one	or	more	clotting	episodes	and/or	repeated	
fetal	losses	plus	at	least	two	positive	tests	for	antiphospholipid	antibod-
ies,	 at	 least	 12	 weeks	 apart;	 however,	 many	 patients	 with	 APS	 do	 not	
meet	these	stringent	criteria,	which	are	intended	for	inclusion	of	patients	
into	studies.

An	 additional	 autoantibody	 test	 with	 predictive	 value	 (not	 used	 for	
diagnosis)	 detects	 anti-Ro/SS-A,	 which	 indicates	 increased	 risk	 for	
neonatal	 lupus,	 sicca	 syndrome,	 and	 SCLE.	 Women	 with	 child-bearing	

potential	and	SLE	should	be	screened	for	antiphospholipid	antibodies	and	
anti-Ro,	because	both	antibodies	have	the	potential	to	cause	fetal	harm.

Antibodies	 to	 C1q	 are	 not	 specific	 or	 sensitive	 for	 SLE;	 however,	
they	are	highly	associated	with	active	lupus	nephritis	and	may	fluctuate	
as	the	activity	of	nephritis	changes.
 ■ STANDARD TESTS FOR DIAGNOSIS
Screening	tests	for	complete	blood	count,	platelet	count,	and	urinalysis	
may	detect	abnormalities	that	contribute	to	the	diagnosis	and	influence	
management	decisions.
 ■ TESTS FOR FOLLOWING DISEASE COURSE
It	 is	 useful	 to	 follow	 tests	 that	 indicate	 the	 status	 of	 organ	 involve-
ment	 known	 to	 be	 present	 during	 SLE	 flares.	 These	 might	 include	
urinalysis	 for	 hematuria	 and	 proteinuria,	 hemoglobin	 levels,	 platelet	
counts,	and	serum	levels	of	creatinine	or	albumin.	There	is	great	inter-
est	 in	 identification	 of	 additional	 markers	 of	 disease	 activity.	 Can-
didates	 include	 levels	 of	 anti-DNA	 and	 anti-C1q	 antibodies,	 several	
components	 of	 complement	 (C3	 is	 most	 widely	 available),	 activated	
complement	products	(an	assay	is	commercially	available	that	measures	
binding	 to	 the	 C4d	 receptor	 on	 erythrocytes	 and	 B	 cells),	 IFN-induc-
ible	 gene	 expression	 in	 peripheral	 blood	 cells,	 serum	 levels	 of	 BLyS	
(B	 lymphocyte	 stimulator,	 also	 called	 BAFF),	 and	 urinary	 levels	 of	
TNF-like	 weak	 inducer	 of	 apoptosis	 (TWEAK),	 neutrophil	 gelatinase-	
associated	lipocalin	(NGAL),	or	monocyte	chemotactic	protein	1	(MCP-
1).	 None	 is	 uniformly	 agreed	 upon	 as	 a	 reliable	 indicator	 of	 flare	 or	 of	
response	to	therapeutic	interventions.	It	is	likely	that	a	panel	of	multiple	
proteins	 and	 nuclear	 products	 (and	 possibly	 levels	 of	 selected	 miRNAs	
and	 methylation	 profiles	 of	 DNA)	 will	 be	 developed	 to	 predict	 both	
impending	flare	and	response	to	recently	instituted	therapies.	Increased	
quantities	of	plasma	cells,	and	increased	expression	of	their	gene	signa-
tures	 in	 whole	 blood,	 are	 associated	 with	 active	 disease	 and	 flares,	 but	
measurements	 are	 not	 commercially	 available.	 For	 now,	 the	 physician	
should	 determine	 for	 each	 patient	 whether	 certain	 available	 laboratory	
test	changes	predict	flare	(falling	complement,	rising	anti-DNA,	increased	
proteinuria,	worsening	anemia,	etc.).	If	so,	altering	therapy	in	response	to	
these	changes	may	be	advisable	(30	mg	of	prednisone	daily	for	2	weeks	has	
been	shown	to	prevent	flares	in	patients	with	rising	anti-DNA	plus	falling	
complement).	In	addition,	given	the	increased	prevalence	of	atherosclero-
sis	in	SLE,	it	is	advisable	to	follow	the	recommendations	of	the	National	
Cholesterol	 Education	 Program	 for	 testing	 and	 treatment,	 including	
scoring	of	SLE	as	an	independent	risk	factor,	similar	to	diabetes	mellitus.

MANAGEMENT OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS 
ERYTHEMATOSUS
There	is	no	cure	for	SLE,	and	complete	sustained	remissions	are	rare.	
There	is	an	international	effort	to	encourage	practitioners	and	patients	
to	aim	for	low-level	disease	activity	(LLDAS),	meaning	mild	symptoms

temic	 Lupus	 Erythematosus	 Disease	 Activity	 Score-2K	 (SLEDAI-2K;	
Touma	Z	et	al,	Lupus	19:49,	2010).	SLEDAI-2K	is	a	widely	used	mea-

current	 prednisone	 dose	 ≤7.5	 mg	 daily;	 and	 (5)	 well-tolerated	 stable	
doses	 of	 antimalarials	 and/or	 immunosuppressives.	 LLDAS	 can	 be	
achieved	in	50–80%	of	patients	and,	if	sustained	for	2	or	more	years	
(possible	in	~30%),	associates	with	significantly	less	accrual	of	damage	
and	better	quality	of	life.	Therefore,	the	physician	should	plan	to	induce	
improvement	 of	 acute	 flares	 and	 then	 maintain	 improvements	 with	
strategies	 that	 suppress	 symptoms	 to	 an	 acceptable	 level	 and	 prevent	
organ	 damage.	 Chronic	 prednisone	 doses	 should	 be	 tapered	 to	 the	
lowest	 doses	 possible	 (ideally	 ≤7.5	 mg).	 Therapeutic	 choices	 depend	
on	 (1)	 whether	 disease	 manifestations	 are	 life-threatening	 or	 likely	
to	 cause	 organ	 damage,	 justifying	 aggressive	 therapies;	 (2)	 whether	
manifestations	 are	 potentially	 reversible;	 and	 (3)	 the	 best	 approaches	
to	 preventing	 complications	 of	 disease	 and	 its	 treatments.	 Therapies,	
doses,	and	adverse	effects	are	listed	in	Table	356-6.

CONSERVATIVE THERAPIES FOR 
MANAGEMENT OF NON-LIFE-
THREATENING DISEASE
Among	patients	with	fatigue,	pain,	and	autoantibodies	indicative	of	SLE	
but	 without	 major	 organ	 involvement,	 management	 can	 be	 directed	
to	 suppression	 of	 symptoms.	 Analgesics	 and	 antimalarials	 are	 main-
stays.	 NSAIDs	 are	 useful	 analgesics/anti-inflammatories,	 particularly	
for	 arthritis/arthralgias.	 However,	 two	 major	 issues	 indicate	 caution	
in	 using	 NSAIDs.	 First,	 SLE	 patients	 compared	 with	 the	 general	 pop-
ulation	 are	 at	 increased	 risk	 for	 NSAID-induced	 aseptic	 meningitis,	
elevated	 serum	 transaminases,	 hypertension,	 and	 renal	 dysfunction.	
Second,	 all	 NSAIDs,	 particularly	 those	 that	 inhibit	 cyclooxygenase-2	
specifically,	 may	 increase	 risk	 for	 myocardial	 infarction.	 Acetamino-
phen	 to	 control	 pain	 may	 be	 a	 good	 strategy,	 but	 NSAIDs	 are	 more	
effective	 in	 some	 patients.	 The	 relative	 hazards	 of	 NSAIDs	 compared	
with	low-dose	glucocorticoid	therapy	have	not	been	established.	Anti-
malarials	 (hydroxychloroquine,	 chloroquine,	 and	 quinacrine)	 often	
reduce	 disease	 symptoms.	 Withdrawal	 of	 hydroxychloroquine	 results	
in	 increased	 numbers	 of	 disease	 flares.	 Hydroxychloroquine	 prolongs	
survival	 and	 reduces	 accrual	 of	 tissue	 damage,	 including	 renal	 dam-
age.	 Some	 experts	 recommend	 a	 hydroxychloroquine	 blood	 level	 of		
≥750	 ng/mL	 to	 optimize	 responses	 in	 active	 SLE;	 after	 achieving	
response,	doses	should	be	reduced.	Because	of	potential	retinal	toxicity	
(occurring	in	6%	of	patients	after	cumulative	doses	of	1000	g,	~5	years	
of	continuing	therapy),	patients	receiving	antimalarials	should	undergo	
ophthalmologic	 examinations	 annually.	 One	 clinical	 trial	 showed	 that	
administration	of	dehydroepiandrosterone	reduced	activity	of	mild	dis-
ease.	If	quality	of	life	is	inadequate	despite	these	conservative	measures,	
treatment	with	low	doses	of	systemic	glucocorticoids	may	be	necessary.	
Belimumab	 (anti-Baff)	 and	 anifrolumab	 (anti-IFN	 type	 1	 receptor)	
are	biologics	that	are	each	effective	for	patients	with	persistent	disease	
activity	and	fatigue	despite	standard	therapies;	SLE	patients	most	likely	
to	respond	to	belimumab	have	robust	clinical	activity	(SLEDAI-2K	score	
of	 ≥10),	 positive	 anti-DNA,	 and	 low	 serum	 complement.	 See	 above	
under	“Management	of	Systemic	Lupus	Erythematosus”	for	more	details	
regarding	SLEDAI-2K.	Lupus	dermatitis	should	be	managed	with	topi-
cal	sunscreens,	anti-malarials,	topical	glucocorticoids,	and/or	tacrolimus	
and,	if	severe	or	unresponsive,	systemic	glucocorticoids	with	or	without	
mycophenolate	 mofetil,	 azathioprine,	 methotrexate,	 or	 belimumab.	
Anifrolumab	has	been	highly	effective	in	patients	with	lupus	dermatitis.

 ■ LIFE-THREATENING SLE: PROLIFERATIVE FORMS 
OF LUPUS NEPHRITIS
Guidelines	for	management	of	lupus	nephritis	have	been	published:	see	
Tables	356-3	and	356-6	and	Figure	356-2.	The	mainstay	of	treatment	

for	 any	 inflammatory	 life-threatening	 or	 organ-threatening	 manifes-
tations	 of	 SLE	 is	 systemic	 glucocorticoids	 (0.5–1	 mg/kg	 per	 day	 PO	
or	500–1000	mg	of	methylprednisolone	sodium	succinate	IV	daily	for		
3	 days	 followed	 by	 0.5–1	 mg/kg	 of	 daily	 prednisone	 or	 equivalent).	
Evidence	that	glucocorticoid	therapy	is	life-saving	comes	from	retro-
spective	studies	from	the	predialysis	era;	survival	was	significantly	bet-
ter	in	people	with	DPGN	treated	with	high-dose	daily	glucocorticoids	
(40–60	 mg	 of	 prednisone	 daily	 for	 4–6	 months)	 versus	 lower	 doses.	
Currently,	 high	 doses	 are	 recommended	 for	 much	 shorter	 periods;	
recent	trials	of	interventions	for	severe	SLE	use	4–6	weeks	of	0.5–1	mg/
kg	per	day	of	prednisone	or	equivalent.	Thereafter,	doses	are	tapered	as	
rapidly	as	the	clinical	situation	permits,	usually	to	a	maintenance	dose	
≤7.5	 mg	 of	 prednisone	 or	 equivalent	 per	 day.	 Many	 patients	 with	 an	
episode	of	severe	SLE	require	many	years	of	maintenance	therapy	with	
low-dose	 glucocorticoids.	 Frequent	 attempts	 to	 gradually	 reduce	 the	
glucocorticoid	requirement	are	recommended	because	virtually	every-
one	 develops	 important	 adverse	 effects	 (Table	 356-6).	 High-quality	
clinical	studies	regarding	initiating	therapy	for	severe,	active	SLE	with	
IV	pulses	of	high-dose	glucocorticoids	are	not	available.	The	use	of	IV	
pulses	 of	 glucocorticoids	 must	 be	 tempered	 by	 safety	 considerations,	
such	as	the	presence	of	conditions	adversely	affected	by	glucocorticoids	
(e.g.,	infection,	hyperglycemia,	hypertension,	osteoporosis).	One	open	
trial	showed	high	response	rates	in	patients	with	lupus	nephritis	treated	
with	mycophenolate	mofetil	plus	rituximab,	without	maintenance	daily	
glucocorticoids;	how	widely	this	can	be	used	is	unclear.

Cytotoxic/immunosuppressive	agents	added	to	glucocorticoids	are	
recommended	to	treat	serious	SLE.	Almost	all	prospective	controlled	
trials	in	SLE	involving	such	agents	have	been	conducted	in	combina-
tion	 with	 glucocorticoids	 in	 patients	 with	 lupus	 nephritis.	 Therefore,	
the	following	recommendations	apply	to	treatment	of	nephritis.	Either	
cyclophosphamide	 (an	 alkylating	 agent)	 or	 mycophenolate	 mofetil		
(a	relatively	lymphocyte-specific	inhibitor	of	inosine	monophosphatase	
and	therefore	of	purine	synthesis)	is	an	acceptable	choice	for	induction	
of	improvement	in	severely	ill	patients;	azathioprine	(a	purine	analogue	
and	 cycle-specific	 antimetabolite)	 may	 be	 effective	 but	 is	 associated	
with	more	flares.	In	patients	whose	renal	biopsies	show	ISN	grade	III	or	
IV	disease,	early	treatment	with	combinations	of	glucocorticoids	and	
cyclophosphamide	 reduces	 progression	 to	 ESRD	 and	 death.	 Shorter-	
term	 studies	 with	 glucocorticoids	 plus	 mycophenolate	 mofetil	 (pro-
spective	randomized	trials	of	6	months,	follow-up	studies	of	5	years)	
show	 that	 this	 regimen	 is	 similar	 to	 cyclophosphamide	 in	 achieving	
improvement.	 Comparisons	 are	 complicated	 by	 effects	 of	 race,	 since	
higher	proportions	of	African	Americans	and	Latin	Americans	respond	
to	mycophenolate	than	to	cyclophosphamide,	whereas	similar	propor-
tions	 of	 whites	 and	 Asians	 respond	 to	 each	 drug.	 Regarding	 toxicity,	
diarrhea	 is	 more	 common	 with	 mycophenolate	 mofetil;	 amenorrhea,	
leukopenia,	and	nausea	are	more	common	with	high-dose	cyclophos-
phamide.	Importantly,	rates	of	severe	infections	and	death	are	similar	
in	 meta-analyses.	 Two	 different	 regimens	 of	 IV	 cyclophosphamide	
are	 available	 for	 induction	 therapy.	 For	 white	 patients	 with	 northern	
European	backgrounds,	low	doses	of	cyclophosphamide	(500	mg	every	
2	 weeks	 for	 six	 total	 doses,	 followed	 by	 daily	 azathioprine	 or	 myco-
phenolate	 maintenance)	 are	 as	 effective	 as	 standard	 high	 doses,	 with	
less	toxicity.	Ten-year	follow-up	has	shown	no	differences	between	the	
high-dose	and	low-dose	groups	(death	or	ESRD	in	9–20%	of	patients	in	
each	group).	It	is	not	clear	whether	the	data	apply	to	U.S.	populations,	
especially	African	Americans	and	Latinas.	In	general,	it	may	be	better	
to	induce	improvement	in	African-American	or	Hispanic	patients	with	
proliferative	 glomerulonephritis	 with	 mycophenolate	 mofetil	 (2–3	 g	
daily)	rather	than	cyclophosphamide,	with	the	option	to	switch	if	no	
evidence	of	response	is	detectable	after	2–6	months	of	treatment.	For	
whites	 and	 Asians,	 induction	 with	 either	 mycophenolate	 mofetil	 or	
cyclophosphamide	 is	 acceptable.	 The	 presence	 of	 cellular	 or	 fibrotic	
crescents	in	glomeruli	with	proliferative	glomerulonephritis,	or	rapidly	
progressive	 glomerulonephritis,	 indicates	 more	 severe	 disease	 and	
a	 worse	 prognosis.	 High-dose	 cyclophosphamide	 (500–1000	 mg/m2	
body	surface	area	given	monthly	IV	for	6	months,	followed	by	azathi-
oprine	or	mycophenolate	maintenance)	is	an	acceptable	approach	for	
patients	with	severe	nephritis.	Cyclophosphamide	and	mycophenolate

responses	begin	3–16	weeks	after	treatment	is	initiated,	whereas	gluco-
corticoid	responses	may	begin	within	24	h.	The	incidence	of	ovarian	
failure,	 a	 common	 effect	 of	 high-dose	 cyclophosphamide	 therapy	
(but	 probably	 not	 of	 low-dose	 therapy),	 can	 be	 reduced	 by	 treat-
ment	with	a	gonadotropin-releasing	hormone	agonist	(e.g.,	leuprolide		
3.75	 mg	 intramuscularly)	 prior	 to	 each	 monthly	 cyclophosphamide	
dose.	Recent	studies	have	shown	improved	short-term	responses	with	
a	 combination	 of	 calcineurin	 inhibitors	 (tacrolimus,	 voclosporin)	
plus	 mycophenolate	 (MMF)	 plus	 glucocorticoids	 (GC)	 compared	
with	MMF	or	cyclophosphamide	with	GC.	Complete	renal	responses	
occurred	in	41%	on	triple	therapy	at	52	weeks	compared	with	21%	on	
double	therapy.	Including	partial	with	complete	renal	responses,	70%	
on	triple	vs	50%	on	double	therapy	improved	by	24	weeks.	Calcineurin	
inhibitors	are	nephrotoxic;	they	should	probably	be	discontinued	after	
6	months	if	no	signs	of	improvement	occur	and	used	for	no	more	than	
12	months	in	most	patients.

For	maintenance	therapy,	mycophenolate	and	azathioprine	probably	
are	 similar	 in	 efficacy	 and	 toxicity;	 both	 are	 safer	 than	 cyclophos-
phamide.	 In	 a	 multicenter	 international	 study,	 mycophenolate	 was	
superior	to	azathioprine	in	maintaining	renal	function	and	survival	in	
patients	 who	 responded	 to	 induction	 therapy	 with	 either	 cyclophos-
phamide	or	mycophenolate.	Patients	with	high	serum	creatinine	levels	
(e.g.,	≥265	μmol/L	[≥3.0	mg/dL])	many	months	in	duration	and	high	
chronicity	 scores	 on	 renal	 biopsy	 are	 not	 likely	 to	 respond	 to	 any	 of	
these	therapies.	The	number	of	SLE	flares	is	reduced	by	maintenance	
therapy	 with	 mycophenolate	 mofetil	 (1.5–2	 g	 daily)	 or	 azathioprine	
(1–2.5	 mg/kg	 per	 day).	 Mycophenolate,	 cyclophosphamide,	 metho-
trexate,	 and	 calcineurin	 inhibitors	 can	 cause	 fetal	 harm;	 patients	
should	be	off	any	of	these	for	at	least	3	months	before	attempting	to	
conceive.	Azathioprine	can	be	used	if	necessary	to	control	active	SLE	
in	patients	who	are	pregnant.	Patients	treated	with	azathioprine	may	be	
prescreened	for	homozygous	deficiency	of	the	TMPT	enzyme	(which	is	
required	to	metabolize	the	6-mercaptopurine	product	of	azathioprine)	
because	they	are	at	higher	risk	for	bone	marrow	suppression.

Most	 SLE	 patients	 with	 membranous	 (INS	 class	 V)	 nephritis	 also	
have	proliferative	changes	and	should	be	treated	for	proliferative	dis-
ease.	 However,	 some	 have	 pure	 membranous	 changes.	 Treatment	 for	
this	 group	 is	 less	 well	 defined.	 Some	 authorities	 do	 not	 recommend	
immunosuppression	 unless	 proteinuria	 is	 in	 the	 nephrotic	 range	
(although	 treatment	 with	 angiotensin-converting	 enzyme	 inhibitors	
or	 angiotensin	 II	 receptor	 blockers	 is	 recommended).	 Prospective	
controlled	trials	suggest	that	alternate-day	glucocorticoids	plus	cyclo-
phosphamide	or	mycophenolate	mofetil	or	cyclosporine	or	tacrolimus	
are	all	effective	in	the	majority	of	patients	in	reducing	proteinuria.	It	
is	more	controversial	whether	any	of	these	treatments	preserve	renal	
function	over	the	long	term.

Good	improvement	occurs	in	approximately	60%	of	lupus	nephri-
tis	 patients	 receiving	 either	 cyclophosphamide	 or	 mycophenolate	 at	
1–2	 years	 of	 follow-up.	 Addition	 of	 a	 calcineurin	 inhibitor	 improves	
response	rates	(70-80%	in	triple	therapy	vs	40-60%	in	double	therapy)	
and	 increases	 time	 to	 flare.	 However,	 at	 least	 50%	 of	 these	 individ-
uals	 have	 flares	 of	 nephritis	 over	 the	 next	 5	 years,	 and	 re-treatment	
is	 required;	 such	 individuals	 are	 more	 likely	 to	 progress	 to	 ESRD.	
Long-term	outcome	of	lupus	nephritis	to	most	interventions	is	better	
in	whites	than	in	African	Americans.	Small	controlled	trials	(in	Asia)	
of	leflunomide,	a	relatively	lymphocyte-specific	pyrimidine	antagonist	
licensed	for	use	in	rheumatoid	arthritis,	have	suggested	it	can	suppress	
disease	 activity	 in	 some	 SLE	 patients.	 Methotrexate	 (a	 folinic	 acid	
antagonist)	may	have	a	role	in	the	treatment	of	arthritis	and	dermatitis	
but	 probably	 not	 in	 nephritis	 or	 other	 life-threatening	 disease.	 Most	
patients	with	SLE	of	any	type	should	be	treated	with	hydroxychloro-
quine	since	it	prolongs	survival	and	reduces	overall	damage.	Patients	
with	proteinuria	>500	mg	daily	should	receive	angiotensin-converting	
enzyme	inhibitors	or	angiotensin	receptor	blockers	as	they	reduce	the	
chance	for	ESRD.

Use	 of	 biologics	 directed	 against	 B	 cells	 for	 active	 SLE	 is	 under	
intense	 study.	 Anti-CD20	 (rituximab),	 particularly	 in	 patients	 with	
SLE	 who	 are	 resistant	 to	 the	 more	 standard	 combination	 therapies	
discussed	above,	is	widely	used.	Several	open	trials	have	shown	efficacy	

in	 a	 majority	 of	 such	 patients,	 both	 for	 nephritis	 and	 for	 extrarenal	
lupus.	 However,	 prospective	 placebo-controlled	 randomized	 trials,	
one	 in	 renal	 and	 one	 in	 nonrenal	 SLE,	 did	 not	 show	 a	 difference	
between	anti-CD20	and	placebo	when	added	to	standard	combination	
therapies.	 A	 monoclonal	 antibody	 anti-CD20	 that	 depletes	 tissue	 B	
cells	 better	 than	 rituximab	 (obinutuzumab)	 has	 received	 fast	 track	
approval	by	the	U.S.	Food	and	Drug	Administration	(FDA)	for	poten-
tial	approval	in	SLE,	but	data	from	phase	3	clinical	trials	have	not	yet	
been	 published.	 Belimumab	 was	 recently	 approved	 for	 treatment	 of	
lupus	 nephritis	 in	 the	 USA:	 when	 given	 along	 with	 mycophenolate	
plus	glucocorticoids	for	two	years	it	reduces	renal	damage	significantly.	
Rituximab	 in	 combination	 with	 or	 followed	 by	 belimumab	 is	 also	
being	 studied	 in	 lupus	 nephritis.	 A	 fusion	 protein	 (telitacicept)	 that	
inactivates	both	BAFF	and	APRIL	growth	factors	for	B	cells	has	been	
approved	for	fast-track	review	by	the	FDA;	phase	3	clinical	trials	in	SLE	
have	not	yet	been	reported.
 ■ SPECIAL CONDITIONS IN SLE THAT MAY 
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT THERAPIES
Pregnancy  and  Lupus  Fertility	 rates	 for	 men	 and	 women	 with	
SLE	 are	 probably	 normal.	 However,	 rate	 of	 fetal	 loss	 is	 increased	
(approximately	 two-	 to	 threefold)	 in	 women	 with	 SLE.	 Fetal	 demise	
is	 higher	 in	 mothers	 with	 high	 disease	 activity,	 antiphospholipid	
antibodies	 (especially	 the	 lupus	 anticoagulant),	 hypertension,	 and/
or	 active	 nephritis.	 Suppression	 of	 disease	 activity	 can	 be	 achieved	
by	 administration	 of	 systemic	 glucocorticoids.	 A	 placental	 enzyme,	
11-β-dehydrogenase	2,	deactivates	glucocorticoids;	it	is	more	effective	
in	deactivating	prednisone	and	prednisolone	than	the	fluorinated	glu-
cocorticoids	dexamethasone	and	betamethasone	(fluorinated	steroids	
should	 be	 avoided	 in	 pregnant	 patients).	 Adverse	 effects	 of	 prenatal	
glucocorticoid	exposure	(primarily	the	fluorinated	steroid	betametha-
sone)	 on	 offspring	 may	 include	 low	 birth	 weight,	 developmental	
abnormalities	 in	 the	 CNS,	 and	 predilection	 toward	 adult	 metabolic	
syndrome.	Glucocorticoids	are	listed	by	the	FDA	as	“fetal	risk	cannot	be	
ruled	out.”	Also	in	that	category	are	hydroxychloroquine,	belimumab,	
cyclosporine,	in	the	“may	cause	fetal	harm”	category	are	rituximab,	aza-
thioprine,	cyclophosphamide,	tacrolimus,	and	voclosporin.	In	the	“fetal	
risk	has	been	demonstrated”	or	“avoid	in	pregnancy”	are	methotrexate	
and	mycophenolate.	Therefore,	active	SLE	in	pregnant	women	should	
be	controlled	with	hydroxychloroquine	and,	if	necessary,	prednisone/
prednisolone	at	the	lowest	effective	doses	for	the	shortest	time	required.	
Azathioprine	may	be	added	if	these	treatments	do	not	suppress	disease	
activity.	It	is	likely	that	each	of	these	glucocorticoids	and	immunosup-
pressive	medications	gets	into	breast	milk,	at	least	in	low	levels;	patients	
should	 consider	 not	 breastfeeding	 if	 they	 need	 therapy	 for	 SLE.	 In	
SLE	 patients	 with	 antiphospholipid	 antibodies	 and	 prior	 fetal	 losses,	
treatment	with	heparin	(usually	low-molecular-weight)	plus	low-dose	
aspirin	 has	 been	 shown	 in	 prospective	 controlled	 trials	 to	 increase	
significantly	the	proportion	of	live	births.	Aspirin	alone	may	be	used,	
although	 most	 consider	 it	 less	 effective	 than	 heparin-plus-aspirin.	
Warfarin	is	teratogenic.	Direct	oral	anticoagulants	are	usually	avoided	
in	pregnancy	because	safety	and	efficacy	have	not	been	established	in	
pregnancy	or	APS.	An	additional	potential	problem	for	the	fetus	is	the	
presence	of	antibodies	to	Ro,	sometimes	associated	with	neonatal	lupus	
consisting	of	rash	and/or	congenital	heart	block	with	or	without	cardio-
myopathy.	 The	 cardiac	 manifestations	 can	 be	 life-threatening;	 there-
fore,	the	presence	of	anti-Ro	requires	vigilant	monitoring	of	fetal	heart	
rates	with	prompt	intervention	(delivery	if	possible)	if	distress	occurs.	
Hydroxychloroquine	 treatment	 of	 an	 anti-Ro-positive	 mother	 whose	
prior	infant	developed	congenital	heart	block	significantly	reduces	the	
chance	that	subsequent	fetuses	will	develop	heart	block.	Dexametha-
sone	treatment	of	a	mother	in	whom	fetal	first-	or	second-degree	heart	
block	 is	 detected	 in	 utero	 sometimes	 prevents	 progression	 of	 heart	
block.	 Women	 with	 SLE	 usually	 tolerate	 pregnancy	 without	 disease	
flares.	 However,	 a	 small	 proportion	 develops	 severe	 flares	 requiring	
aggressive	glucocorticoid	therapy	or	early	delivery.

Lupus  and  Antiphospholipid  Syndrome  Patients	 with	 SLE	
who	have	venous	or	arterial	clotting	and/or	repeated	fetal	losses	and	at

2748 least	two	positive	tests	for	antiphospholipid	antibodies	have	APS	and	
should	be	managed	with	long-term	anticoagulation	(Chap. 357).	With	
warfarin,	 a	 target	 international	 normalized	 ratio	 (INR)	 of	 2.0–2.5	 is	
recommended	for	patients	with	one	episode	of	venous	clotting;	an	INR	
of	3.0–3.5	is	recommended	for	patients	with	recurring	clots	or	arterial	
clotting,	particularly	in	the	CNS.	Recommendations	are	based	on	both	
retrospective	and	prospective	studies	of	posttreatment	clotting	events	
and	adverse	effects	from	anticoagulation.	Direct	oral	anticoagulants	are	
not	effective	and	not	recommended	in	APS.

Microvascular Thrombotic Crisis (Thrombotic Thrombocy-
topenic  Purpura,  Hemolytic-Uremic  Syndrome)  This	 syn-
drome	of	hemolysis,	thrombocytopenia,	and	microvascular	thrombosis	
in	 kidneys,	 brain,	 and	 other	 tissues	 carries	 a	 high	 mortality	 rate	 and	
occurs	 most	 commonly	 in	 young	 individuals	 with	 lupus	 nephritis.	
The	 most	 useful	 laboratory	 tests	 are	 identification	 of	 schistocytes	 on	
peripheral	 blood	 smears,	 elevated	 serum	 levels	 of	 lactate	 dehydroge-
nase,	and	low	levels	of	ADAMS13	activity”.	Plasma	exchange	or	exten-
sive	plasmapheresis	is	usually	life-saving;	most	authorities	recommend	
concomitant	glucocorticoid	therapy;	there	is	no	evidence	that	cytotoxic	
drugs	 are	 effective.	 Rituximab	 and	 eculizumab	 (an	 inhibitor	 of	 C5)	
have	been	used	in	refractory	cases.

Lupus  Dermatitis  Patients	 with	 any	 form	 of	 lupus	 dermatitis	
should	 minimize	 exposure	 to	 ultraviolet	 light,	 using	 appropriate	
clothing	 and	 sunscreens	 with	 a	 sun	 protection	 factor	 of	 at	 least	 30.	
Topical	 glucocorticoids	 and	 antimalarials	 (such	 as	 hydroxychloro-
quine)	 are	 effective	 in	 reducing	 lesion	 severity	 in	 most	 patients	 and	
are	 relatively	 safe.	 Methotrexate,	 azathioprine,	 mycophenolate,	 beli-
mumab	and	anifrolumab	each	may	be	effective	in	some	patients	who	
need	additional	treatment.	Systemic	treatment	with	retinoic	acid	is	a	
useful	 strategy	 in	 patients	 with	 inadequate	 improvement	 after	 these	
interventions	 on	 adverse	 effects	 are	 potentially	 severe	 (particularly	
fetal	abnormalities),	and	there	are	stringent	reporting	requirements	for	
its	use	in	the	United	States.	Extensive,	pruritic,	bullous,	or	ulcerating	
dermatitides	 usually	 improve	 promptly	 after	 institution	 of	 systemic	
glucocorticoids;	tapering	may	be	accompanied	by	flare	of	lesions,	thus	
necessitating	use	of	a	second	medication	such	as	hydroxychloroquine,	
retinoids,	 or	 belimumab.	 Cytotoxic	 medications	 such	 as	 methotrex-
ate,	 azathioprine,	 or	 mycophenolate	 mofetil	 may	 also	 be	 effective.	 In		
therapy-resistant	 lupus	 dermatitis	 there	 are	 reports	 of	 success	 with	
topical	 tacrolimus	 (caution	 must	 be	 exerted	 because	 of	 the	 possible	
increased	risk	for	malignancies)	or	with	systemic	dapsone	or	thalido-
mide	or	the	related	lenalidomide	(the	extreme	danger	of	fetal	deformi-
ties	from	thalidomide	requires	permission	from	and	supervision	by	the	
supplier;	peripheral	neuropathy	is	also	common).
 ■ PREVENTIVE THERAPIES
Prevention	of	complications	of	SLE	and	its	therapy	include	providing	
appropriate	 vaccinations	 (the	 administration	 of	 influenza	 and	 pneu-
mococcal	vaccines	has	been	studied	in	patients	with	SLE;	flare	rates	are	
similar	to	those	receiving	placebo)	and	suppressing	recurrent	urinary	
tract	 infections.	 In	 patients	 receiving	 glucocorticoids,	 the	 higher	 the	
daily	dose,	the	lower	is	the	immune	response	to	vaccination;	however,	
the	 great	 majority	 of	 patients	 achieve	 protective	 levels.	 Vaccination	
with	 attenuated	 live	 viruses	 is	 generally	 discouraged	 in	 patients	 who	
are	 immunosuppressed;	 however,	 a	 recent	 study	 of	 vaccination	 of	 a	
small	 number	 of	 SLE	 patient	 with	 Zostavax	 showed	 safety	 and	 effi-
cacy.	 The	 availability	 of	 Shingrix	 (which	 does	 not	 contain	 live	 virus)	
should	replace	Zostavax.	Patients	receiving	≥20	mg	of	prednisone	daily	
may	 be	 protected	 from	 pneumocystis	 infections	 with	 trimethoprim-	
sulfamethoxazole	(Bactrim)	or	atovaquone	(we	prefer	the	latter	because	
SLE	 patients	 are	 predisposed	 to	 allergic	 reactions	 to	 sulfa-contain-
ing	 medications)	 and	 from	 recurrent	 herpes	 simplex	 infections	 with	
acyclovir,	 with	 preventives	 withdrawn	 when	 the	 prednisone	 dose	 is	
decreased.	Strategies	to	prevent	osteoporosis	should	be	initiated	in	most	
patients	likely	to	require	long-term	glucocorticoid	therapy	and/or	with	
other	 predisposing	 factors.	 Postmenopausal	 women	 can	 be	 partially	
protected	from	steroid-induced	osteoporosis	with	calcium	supplemen-
tation,	vitamin	D,	and	either	bisphosphonates	or	denosumab.	Safety	of	

long-term	use	of	these	strategies	in	premenopausal	women	is	not	well	
established.	Control	of	hypertension	and	appropriate	prevention	strate-
gies	for	atherosclerosis,	including	monitoring	and	treatment	of	dyslipi-
demias,	management	of	hyperglycemia,	and	management	of	obesity,	are	
recommended.	Statin	therapies	reduce	all-cause	deaths	in	SLE	patients	
and	should	be	considered	in	patients	with	elevated	LDL	or	total	choles-
terol	levels.	Finally,	the	physician	must	keep	in	mind	that	some	cancers	
are	increased	in	SLE	patients	including	non-Hodgkin	lymphomas	and	
cancers	of	thyroid,	lung,	liver,	and	vulvar/vaginal	tissues.
 ■ EXPERIMENTAL THERAPIES
Studies	of	highly	targeted	experimental	therapies	for	SLE	are	in	prog-
ress.	 They	 include	 (1)	 depletion	 of	 B	 cells	 with	 obinituzumab;	 (2)	
inhibition	of	B	cells	by	blocking	more	than	one	receptor	for	BAFF	(tel-
acicept);	(3)	elimination	of	plasma	cells;	(4)	B-cell	inhibition	through	
inhibition	of	BTK,	anti-CD20	therapies	more	depleting	than	rituximab,	
or	a	fusion	protein	that	inhibits	both	BAFF	and	APRIL	B-cell	growth	
factors;	 (5)	 inhibition	 of	 B-/T-cell	 second	 signal	 coactivation	 with	
CTLA-Ig	 or	 anti-CD40L;	 (6)	 inhibition	 of	 innate	 immune	 activation	
via	TLR7	or	TLR7	and	TLR9;	(7)	induction	of	regulatory	T	cells	with	
peptides	 from	 immunoglobulins	 or	 autoantigens	 or	 with	 low	 doses	
of	 IL-2;	 (8)	 inhibition	 of	 T	 effector	 cells	 through	 CD6;	 (9)	 targeting	
lymphocyte	 migration	 by	 modulation	 of	 the	 S1P1	 receptor;	 and	 (10)	
inhibition	of	lymphocyte	activation	by	blockade	of	Jak/Stat.

A	 few	 studies	 have	 used	 vigorous	 untargeted	 immunosuppression	
with	 high-dose	 cyclophosphamide	 plus	 anti-T-cell	 strategies,	 with	
rescue	 by	 transplantation	 of	 autologous	 hematopoietic	 stem	 cells	 for	
the	treatment	of	severe	and	refractory	SLE.	One	U.S.	report	showed	an	
estimated	mortality	rate	over	5	years	of	15%	and	sustained	remission	
in	50%.	Mesenchymal	stem	cell	transplant	studies	are	also	underway	in	
lupus.	It	is	hoped	that	in	the	next	edition	of	this	text,	we	will	be	able	to	
recommend	more	effective	and	less	toxic	approaches	to	treatment	of	
SLE	based	on	some	of	these	strategies.

PATIENT OUTCOMES, PROGNOSIS,  
AND SURVIVAL
Survival	in	patients	with	SLE	in	the	United	States,	Canada,	Europe,	and	
China	is	~95%	at	5	years,	90%	at	10	years,	and	78%	at	20	years.	In	the	
United	States,	African	Americans	and	Hispanic	Americans	with	a	mestizo	
heritage	have	a	worse	prognosis	than	whites,	whereas	Africans	in	Africa	
and	Hispanic	Americans	with	a	Puerto	Rican	origin	do	not.	The	relative	
importance	of	gene	mixtures	and	environmental	differences	accounting	
for	ethnic	differences	is	not	known.	Poor	prognosis	(~50%	mortality	in	
10	years)	in	most	series	is	associated	with	(at	the	time	of	diagnosis)	high	
serum	creatinine	levels	(>124	μmol/L	[>1.4	mg/dL]),	hypertension,	neph-
rotic	syndrome	(24-h	urine	protein	excretion	>2.6	g),	anemia	(hemoglo-
bin	<124	g/L	[<12.4	g/dL]),	hypoalbuminemia,	hypocomplementemia,	
antiphospholipid	 antibodies,	 male	 sex,	 ethnicity	 (African	 American,	
Hispanic	with	mestizo	heritage),	and	low	socioeconomic	status.	Data	
regarding	outcomes	in	SLE	patients	with	renal	transplants	show	mixed	
results:	 some	 series	 show	 a	 twofold	 increase	 in	 graft	 rejection	 com-
pared	to	patients	with	other	causes	of	ESRD,	whereas	others	show	no	
differences.	 Overall	 patient	 survival	 is	 comparable	 (85%	 at	 2	 years).	
Lupus	 nephritis	 occurs	 in	 ~5%	 of	 transplanted	 kidneys.	 Disability	 in	
patients	with	SLE	is	common	due	primarily	to	chronic	fatigue,	arthritis,	
and	pain,	as	well	as	renal	disease.	As	many	as	30–50%	of	patients	may	
achieve	low	disease	activity	(defined	as	mild	activity	on	hydroxychloro-
quine	 with	 or	 without	 low-dose	 glucocorticoids);	 <10%	 experience	
remissions	 (defined	 as	 no	 disease	 activity	 on	 no	 medications).	 The	
leading	causes	of	death	in	the	first	decade	of	disease	are	systemic	dis-
ease	 activity,	 renal	 failure,	 and	 infections;	 subsequently,	 thromboem-
bolic	events	become	increasingly	frequent	causes	of	mortality.

DRUG-INDUCED LUPUS
This	is	a	syndrome	of	positive	ANA	associated	with	symptoms	such	as	
fever,	malaise,	arthritis	or	intense	arthralgias/myalgias,	serositis,	and/
or	 rash.	 The	 syndrome	 appears	 during	 therapy	 with	 certain	 medica-
tions	and	biologic	agents,	is	predominant	in	whites,	has	less	female	pre-
dilection	than	SLE,	rarely	involves	kidneys	or	brain,	is	rarely	associated

and	 usually	 resolves	 over	 several	 weeks	 after	 discontinuation	 of	 the	
offending	 medication.	 The	 list	 of	 substances	 that	 can	 induce	 lupus-
like	disease	is	long.	Among	the	most	frequent	are	the	antiarrhythmics	
procainamide,	 disopyramide,	 and	 propafenone;	 the	 antihypertensive	
hydralazine;	 several	 angiotensin-converting	 enzyme	 inhibitors	 and	
beta	 blockers;	 the	 antithyroid	 propylthiouracil;	 the	 antipsychotics	
chlorpromazine	 and	 lithium;	 the	 anticonvulsants	 carbamazepine	 and	
phenytoin;	 the	 antibiotics	 isoniazid,	 minocycline,	 and	 nitrofurantoin	
(Macrodantin);	 the	 antirheumatic	 sulfasalazine;	 the	 diuretic	 hydro-
chlorothiazide;	and	the	antihyperlipidemics	lovastatin	and	simvastatin.	
Biologics	that	can	cause	drug-induced	lupus	(DIL)	include	inhibitors	
of	 IFNs	 and	 TNF.	 In	 DIL,	 ANA	 usually	 appears	 before	 symptoms;	
however,	 many	 of	 the	 medications	 mentioned	 above	 induce	 ANA	 in	
patients	 who	 never	 develop	 symptoms	 of	 drug-induced	 lupus.	 It	 is	
appropriate	to	test	for	ANA	at	the	first	hint	of	relevant	symptoms	and	
to	use	test	results	to	help	decide	whether	to	withdraw	the	suspect	agent.

357 Antiphospholipid  
Syndrome
Haralampos M. Moutsopoulos,  
Clio P. Mavragani

 ■ DEFINITIONS
Antiphospholipid	 syndrome	 (APS)	 is	 an	 autoantibody-mediated	
acquired	thrombophilia	characterized	by	recurrent	arterial	or	venous	
thrombosis	 and/or	 pregnancy	 morbidity.	 It	 affects	 primarily	 females.	
APS	 may	 occur	 alone	 (primary)	 or	 in	 association	 with	 other	 auto-
immune	 diseases,	 mainly	 systemic	 lupus	 erythematosus	 (SLE)	 (sec-
ondary).	 Catastrophic	 APS	 (CAPS)	 is	 a	 life-threatening	 rapidly	
progressive	 thromboembolic	 disease	 involving	 simultaneously	 three	
or	more	organs.

The	 major	 autoantibodies	 detected	 in	 patients’	 sera	 are	 directed	
against	 negatively	 charged	 phospholipids	 (PLs)	 and/or	 PL-binding	
plasma	 proteins	 such	 as	 β2-glycoprotein	 I	 (β2GPI)	 and	 prothrombin.	

TABLE 357-1  Classification and Nomenclature of Antiphospholipid 
Antibodies

NAME
Antibodies 
against 
cardiolipin 
(aCL)

ASSAY FOR THEIR 
DETECTION
Enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) using as antigen 
cardiolipin (CL), a 
negatively charged 
phospholipid

Antibodies 
against β2GPI 
(anti-β2GPI)

ELISA using as antigen 
affinity purified or 
recombinant β2GPI in the 
absence of PL

Lupus 
anticoagulant 
(LA)

Activated partial 
thromboplastin time 
(aPTT)
Kaolin clotting time (KCT)
Dilute Russel viper 
venom test (DRVVT)

COMMENTS
aCL from patients with APS 
recognize β2GPI existing in the 
human serum as well as in bovine 
serum, which is used to block the 
nonspecific binding sites on the 
ELISA plate. CL simply stabilizes 
β2GPI at high concentration on the 
polystyrene surface.
Antibodies recognize β2GPI bound 
in the absence of CL to an oxidized 
polystyrene surface, where oxygen 
atoms in the moieties C–O or C=O 
were introduced by γ-irradiation.
Antibodies recognize β2GPI or 
prothrombin (PT) and elongate 
aPTT, implying that they interfere 
with the generation of thrombin 
by prothrombin. Prolongation of 
the clotting times is an in vitro 
phenomenon, and LA induces 
thromboses in vivo.

Abbreviations: APL, antiphospholipid syndrome; β2GPI, β2-glycoprotein I; PL, 
phospholipid.

PLs	 are	 components	 of	 the	 cytoplasmic	 membrane	 of	 all	 living	 cells.	
The	 antibodies	 are	 directed	 against	 PLs,	 such	 as	 cardiolipin,	 phos-
phocholine,	 and	 phosphatidylserine.	 The	 plasma	 protein	 β2GPI	 is	 a	
43-kDa	 plasma	 apolipoprotein,	 which	 consists	 of	 326	 amino	 acids	
arranged	in	five	domains	(I	through	V).	Domain	V	forms	a	positively	
charged	 patch,	 suitable	 to	 interact	 with	 negatively	 charged	 PLs.	 In	
plasma,	β2GPI	has	a	circular	conformation	with	domain	V	binding	to	
and	 concealing	 the	 B-cell	 epitopes	 lying	 on	 domain	 I.	 The	 presence	
of	 anti–domain	 I	 IgG	 antibodies	 has	 been	 recently	 associated	 with	
increased	thrombotic	risk.	Another	group	of	antibodies	termed	lupus 
anticoagulant	 (LA)	 prolongs	 clotting	 times	 in	 vitro,	 which	 are	 not	
corrected	by	adding	normal	plasma	(Table 357-1).	Patients	with	APS	
often	 possess	 antibodies	 recognizing	 Treponema  pallidum	 PL/choles-
terol	 complexes,	 detected	 by	 Venereal	 Disease	 Research	 Laboratory	
(VDRL)	tests	and	characterized	as	biologic	false-positive	serologic	tests	
for	syphilis	(BFP-STS).	Since	patients	can	present	with	features	highly	
reminiscent	of	APS	in	the	absence	of	classical	anti-PL	antibodies,	the	
term	 seronegative  APS	 has	 been	 coined.	 In	 patients	 with	 strong	 sus-
picion	 of	 seronegative	 APS,	 testing	 for	 antiphosphatidylserine/proth-
rombin	antibodies	may	have	a	valuable	diagnostic	role.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
The	incidence	of	APS	is	estimated	to	be	~5	cases	per	100,000	persons	
per	year.	The	prevalence	of	APS	in	the	general	population	is	estimated	
to	 be	 40–50	 per	 100,000.	 Anti-PL	 antibodies	 occur	 in	 1–5%	 of	 the	
general	 population.	 Their	 prevalence	 increases	 with	 age;	 however,	 it	
is	questionable	whether	they	are	able	to	induce	thrombotic	events	in	
elderly	individuals.	Moreover,	although	one-third	of	patients	with	SLE	
and	other	autoimmune	diseases	(Chap. 356)	possess	these	antibodies,	
only	5–10%	of	them	develop	APS.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS
The	initiating	events	for	the	induction	of	antibodies	to	PL-binding	pro-
teins	seem	to	be	infections,	oxidative	stress,	and	major	physical	stresses	
such	as	surgery	or	trauma	in	an	appropriate	genetic	background,	given	
the	previously	demonstrated	associations	with	alleles	within	the	HLA	
locus.	 These	 contributors	 seem	 to	 induce	 increased	 apoptosis	 of	 the	
vessel	 endothelial	 cells	 and	 subsequent	 exposure	 of	 PLs.	 The	 latter,	
bound	with	serum	proteins	such	as	β2GPI	or	prothrombin,	lead	to	neo-
antigen	formation,	which	in	turn	triggers	the	induction	of	anti-PLs.	The	
binding	of	anti-PLs	to	the	disrupted	endothelial	cells	leads	to	initiation	
of	 intravascular	 coagulation	 and	 thrombus	 formation.	 Complement

2750 and	 neutrophil	 activation	 and,	 recently,	 an	 imbalance	 between	 type	
I	and	III	interferons	have	been	proposed	as	potential	mechanisms	of	
thrombotic	events	and	APS-related	obstetric	complications.

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND  
LABORATORY FINDINGS
Clinical	manifestations	represent	the	consequences	of	venous	or	arte-
rial	 thrombosis	 and/or	 pregnancy	 morbidity	 (Table  357-2).	 Venous	
thrombosis,	superficial	or	deep,	occurs	primarily	in	the	lower	extrem-
ities,	 often	 leading	 to	 pulmonary	 emboli.	 Thrombosis	 of	 the	 pulmo-
nary	 arteries	 leads	 to	 pulmonary	 hypertension,	 and	 thrombosis	 of	
the	 inferior	 vena	 cava	 to	 Budd-Chiari	 syndrome.	 Cerebral	 venous	
thrombosis	 presents	 with	 signs	 and	 symptoms	 of	 intracranial	 hyper-
tension	and	retinal	vein	thrombosis.	Arterial	thrombosis	affects	more	
commonly	 the	 arteries	 of	 the	 brain	 and	 is	 manifested	 as	 migraines,	
cognitive	 dysfunction,	 transient	 ischemic	 attacks,	 stroke,	 and	 retinal	
artery	occlusion.	Arterial	thrombosis	of	the	extremities	presents	with	
ischemic	 leg	 ulcers,	 digital	 gangrene,	 and	 avascular	 bone	 necrosis,

whereas	 thrombosis	 of	 other	 arteries	 leads	 to	 myocardial	 infarction,	
renal	 artery	 stenosis,	 glomerular	 lesions,	 and	 infarcts	 of	 spleen,	 pan-
creas,	and	adrenals.

Livedo	 reticularis	 consists	 of	 a	 mottled	 reticular	 vascular	 pattern	
that	appears	as	a	lace-like,	purplish	discoloration	of	the	skin.	It	is	prob-
ably	caused	by	swelling	of	the	venules	due	to	obstruction	of	capillaries	
by	 thrombi.	 This	 clinical	 manifestation	 usually	 occurs	 together	 with	
vascular	lesions	in	the	central	nervous	system	and	with	aseptic	bone	
necrosis.	Libman-Sacks	endocarditis	consists	of	very	small	vegetations,	
histologically	characterized	by	organized	platelet-fibrin	microthrombi	
surrounded	 by	 growing	 fibroblasts	 and	 macrophages.	 Glomerular	
involvement	 is	 manifested	 with	 hypertension,	 mildly	 elevated	 serum	
creatinine	 levels,	 and	 proteinuria/hematuria.	 Histologically,	 in	 an	
acute	phase,	thrombotic	microangiopathy	is	present	in	the	glomerular	
capillaries.	In	a	chronic	phase,	fibrous	intima	hyperplasia,	fibrous	and/
or	 fibrocellular	 arteriolar	 occlusions,	 and	 focal	 cortical	 atrophy	 are	
present	(Table	357-2).	Pregnancy	morbidity	manifests	with	increased	
risk	of	recurrent	miscarriages,	intrauterine	growth	retardation,	preec-
lampsia,	eclampsia,	and	preterm	birth.	The	major	causes	of	these	com-
plications	are	due	to	infarctions	of	the	placenta.

Premature	 atherosclerosis	 has	 been	 also	 recognized	 as	 a	 feature	
of	 APS.	 Musculoskeletal	 manifestations	 include,	 in	 addition	 to	 bone	
necrosis,	arthralgia/arthritis,	bone	marrow	necrosis,	muscle	infarction,	
nontraumatic	fractures,	and	osteoporosis.	Coombs-positive	hemolytic	
anemia	 and	 thrombocytopenia	 are	 laboratory	 findings	 associated		
with	APS.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The	 diagnosis	 of	 APS	 should	 be	 seriously	 considered	 in	 cases	 of	
thrombosis,	cerebral	vascular	accidents	in	individuals	<55	years	of	age,	
or	pregnancy	morbidity	in	the	presence	of	livedo	reticularis	or	throm-
bocytopenia.	 In	 these	 cases,	 anti-PL	 antibodies	 should	 be	 measured.	
The	 presence	 of	 at	 least	 one	 clinical	 and	 one	 laboratory	 criterion	 is	
compatible	with	the	diagnosis,	in	the	absence	of	other	thrombophilia	
causes.	Clinical	criteria	include	(1)	vascular	thrombosis,	defined	as	one	
or	more	clinical	episodes	of	arterial,	venous,	or	small	vessel	thrombosis	
in	any	tissue	or	organ;	and	(2)	pregnancy	morbidity,	defined	as	(a)	one	
or	 more	 unexplained	 deaths	 of	 a	 morphologically	 normal	 fetus	 at	 or	
beyond	the	10th	week	of	gestation;	(b)	one	or	more	premature	births	
of	a	morphologically	normal	neonate	before	the	34th	week	of	gestation	
because	of	eclampsia,	severe	preeclampsia,	or	placental	insufficiency;	
or	 (c)	 three	 or	 more	 unexplained	 consecutive	 spontaneous	 abortions	
before	the	10th	week	of	gestation.	Laboratory	criteria	include	(1)	LA,	
(2)	anticardiolipin	(aCL),	and/or	(3)	anti-β2GPI	antibodies,	at	interme-
diate	or	high	titers	on	two	occasions	12	weeks	apart.

Differential	 diagnosis	 is	 based	 on	 the	 exclusion	 of	 other	 inherited	
or	 acquired	 causes	 of	 thrombophilia	 (Chap.  116),	 Coombs-positive	
hemolytic	 anemia	 (Chap.  100),	 and	 thrombocytopenia	 (Chap.  115).	
Livedo	 reticularis	 with	 or	 without	 a	 painful	 ulceration	 on	 the	 lower	
extremities	 may	 be	 also	 a	 manifestation	 of	 disorders	 affecting	 (1)	
the	 vascular	 wall,	 such	 as	 atherosclerosis,	 polyarteritis	 nodosa,	 SLE,	
cryoglobulinemia,	and	lymphomas;	or	(2)	the	vascular	lumen,	such	as	
myeloproliferative	disorders,	hypercholesterolemia,	or	other	causes	of	
thrombophilia.

TREATMENT
Antiphospholipid Syndrome

It	 has	 been	 increasingly	 appreciated	 that	 the	 risk	 of	 thrombotic	
and	 obstetric	 events	 is	 closely	 related	 to	 the	 underlying	 anti-PL	
profile.	The	latter	depends	on	the	type	of	autoantibodies	(IgG	high	
risk	vs	IgM	low	risk),	the	number	of	anti-PL	antibodies	(simulta-
neous	 presence	 of	 two	 or	 three	 classical	 autoantibodies	 denotes	 a	
higher	risk	profile	vs	a	single	antibody),	their	titer	(moderate-high	
titer	 vs	 low),	 and	 the	 persistence	 of	 anti-PL	 positivity	 in	 repeated	
measurements.

Following	 the	 first	 thrombotic	 event,	 APS	 patients	 should	 be	
placed	on	vitamin	K	antagonists	(VKAs)	for	life,	aiming	to	achieve

case  of  an  unprovoked  venous  thrombosis.  For  patients  with  arte-
rial  thrombosis,  the  corresponding  INR  target  should  be  3.0–4.0 
or  2.0–3.0  along  with  low-dose  aspirin  (LDA,  75–100  mg  daily), 
depending  on  the  thrombotic/hemorrhagic  patient  profile.  Admin-
istration of direct oral thrombin inhibitors recently has been shown 
to increase the risk of arterial events, especially in patients with triple 
positivity  or  previous  arterial  thrombosis.  However,  they  could  be 
considered with extreme caution in cases in which contraindications 
to VKAs or inability to achieve a target INR despite adherence to the 
treatment are present. In pregnant women with a history of obstetric 
APS, combination treatment with LDA and prophylactic dose of low- 
molecular-weight  heparin  (LMWH)  is  recommended,  whereas  in 
cases of thrombotic APS, LDA plus therapeutic LMWH dose should 
be  administered.  When  recurrent  obstetric  complications  occur 
despite standard treatment, increasing the LMWH dose (from pro-
phylactic to therapeutic) or administering oral hydroxychloroquine 
400  mg/d  or  IV  immunoglobulin  (IVIg)  400  mg/kg  every  day  for   
5 days are alternative options.

For  asymptomatic  individuals  or  SLE  patients  with  a  high-risk 
anti-PL  profile  and  no  evidence  of  a  previous  thrombotic  event 
or  pregnancy  morbidity,  prophylactic  treatment  with  LDA  is  rec-
ommended. In nonpregnant women with a history of APS-related 
obstetric complications, independently of the presence of underly-
ing SLE diagnosis, treatment with LDA seems to reduce the risk of 
a subsequent thrombotic event.

Patients  with  CAPS  should  be  treated  with  combination  ther-
apy  with  glucocorticoids,  heparin,  and  plasma  exchange  or  IVIG 
together with appropriate management of triggering events such as 
infections. For refractory CAPS, B-cell depletion (e.g., with ritux-
imab) or complement inhibition (e.g., with eculizumab) therapies 
are alternative options.

Insights gained by a wealth of basic and clinical research over the 
past two decades have revolutionized the contemporary paradigms for 
the diagnosis and management of RA. Testing for serum antibodies to 
anti-citrullinated  protein  antibodies  (ACPA)  and  rheumatoid  factor 
continues to be valuable in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with 
suspected RA, and these antibodies serve as biomarkers of prognostic 
significance.  Advances  in  imaging  modalities  assist  clinical  decision-
making by improving the detection of joint inflammation and moni-
toring the progression of damage. The science of RA has taken major 
leaps  forward  by  illuminating  new  disease-related  genes,  environ-
mental  interactions,  and  the  molecular  components  and  pathways  of 
disease pathogenesis in even more detail. The relative contribution of 
these cellular and inflammatory mediators in disease pathogenesis has 
been further brought to light by the observed benefits of an expanded 
pipeline of biologic and targeted synthetic disease-modifying therapies. 
Despite this progress, incomplete understanding of the initiating events 
of RA and the factors perpetuating the chronic inflammatory response 
remains a barrier to its cure and prevention.

The past 20 years have witnessed a remarkable improvement in the 
outcomes  of  RA.  The  crippling  arthritis  of  years  past  is  encountered 
much  less  frequently  today.  Much  of  this  progress  can  be  traced  to 
the  expanded  therapeutic  armamentarium  and  the  adoption  of  early 
treatment intervention. The shift in treatment strategy dictates a new 
mindset  for  primary  care  practitioners—namely,  one  that  demands 
early  referral  of  patients  with  inflammatory  arthritis  to  a  rheumatol-
ogist  for  prompt  diagnosis  and  initiation  of  therapy.  Only  then  will 
patients achieve their best outcomes.

CLINICAL FEATURES
The  incidence  of  RA  increases  between  25  and  55  years  of  age,  after 
which it plateaus until the age of 75 and then decreases. The present-
ing symptoms of RA typically result from inflammation of the joints, 
tendons,  and  bursae.  Patients  often  complain  of  early  morning  joint 
stiffness  lasting  >1  hour  that  eases  with  physical  activity.  The  earliest 
involved joints are typically the small joints of the hands and feet. The 
initial pattern of joint involvement may be monoarticular, oligoarticular 
(≤4 joints), or polyarticular (>5 joints), usually in a symmetric distribu-
tion.  Some  patients  with  inflammatory  arthritis  will  present  with  too 
few affected joints to be classified as having RA—so-called undifferen-
tiated inflammatory arthritis. Those with an undifferentiated arthritis 
who are most likely to be diagnosed later with RA have a higher number 
of tender and swollen joints, test positive for serum rheumatoid factor 
(RF) or ACPA, and have higher scores for physical disability.

Once the disease process of RA is established, the wrists and meta-
carpophalangeal  (MCP)  and  proximal  interphalangeal  (PIP)  joints 
stand  out  as  the  most  frequently  involved  joints  (Fig.  358-1).  Distal

INTRODUCTION
Rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  disease  of 
unknown  etiology  characterized  by  a  symmetric  polyarthritis  and  is 
the most common form of chronic inflammatory arthritis. Since per-
sistently active RA often results in articular cartilage and bone destruc-
tion  and  functional  disability,  it  is  vital  to  diagnose  and  treat  this 
disease  early  and  aggressively  before  damage  ensues.  RA,  a  systemic 
disease,  may  also  lead  to  a  variety  of  extraarticular  manifestations, 
including fatigue, subcutaneous nodules, lung involvement, pericardi-
tis,  peripheral  neuropathy,  vasculitis,  and  hematologic  abnormalities, 
which must be managed accordingly.

2752 interphalangeal	 (DIP)	 joint	 involvement	 may	 occur	 in	 RA,	 but	 it	
usually	 is	 a	 manifestation	 of	 coexistent	 osteoarthritis.	 Flexor	 tendon	
tenosynovitis	is	a	frequent	hallmark	of	RA	and	leads	to	decreased	range	
of	motion,	reduced	grip	strength,	and	“trigger”	fingers.	Flexor	tendon	
involvement	may	also	lead	to	tendon	rupture,	with	the	flexor	pollicis	
longest	 the	 most	 common	 flexor	 tendon	 to	 be	 affected	 by	 RA.	 Pro-
gressive	destruction	of	the	joints	and	soft	tissues	may	lead	to	chronic,	
irreversible	 deformities.	 Ulnar	 deviation	 results	 from	 subluxation	 of	
the	MCP	joints,	with	subluxation,	or	partial	dislocation,	of	the	proxi-
mal	phalanx	to	the	volar	side	of	the	hand.	Hyperextension	of	the	PIP	
joint	 with	 flexion	 of	 the	 DIP	 joint	 (“swan-neck	 deformity”),	 flexion	
of	 the	 PIP	 joint	 with	 hyperextension	 of	 the	 DIP	 joint	 (“boutonnière	
deformity”),	and	subluxation	of	the	first	MCP	joint	with	hyperexten-
sion	 of	 the	 first	 interphalangeal	 (IP)	 joint	 (“Z-line	 deformity”)	 also	
may	result	from	damage	to	the	tendons,	joint	capsule,	and	other	soft	
tissues	in	these	small	joints.	Inflammation	about	the	ulnar	styloid	and	
tenosynovitis	of	the	extensor	carpi	ulnaris	may	cause	subluxation	of	the	
distal	ulna,	resulting	in	a	“piano-key	movement”	of	the	ulnar	styloid.	
Although	 metatarsophalangeal	 (MTP)	 joint	 involvement	 in	 the	 feet	
is	 an	 early	 feature	 of	 disease,	 chronic	 inflammation	 of	 the	 ankle	 and	
midtarsal	 regions	 usually	 comes	 later	 and	 may	 lead	 to	 pes	 planoval-
gus	 (“flat	 feet”).	 Large	 joints,	 including	 the	 knees	 and	 shoulders,	 are	
often	affected	in	established	disease,	although	these	joints	may	remain	
asymptomatic	for	many	years	after	onset.

Atlantoaxial	 involvement	 of	 the	 cervical	 spine	 is	 clinically	 note-
worthy	because	of	its	potential	to	cause	compressive	myelopathy	and	

neurologic	 dysfunction.	 Neurologic	 manifestations	 are	 rarely	 a	 pre-
senting	sign	or	symptom	of	atlantoaxial	disease,	but	they	may	evolve	
over	time	with	progressive	instability	of	C1	on	C2.	The	prevalence	of	
atlantoaxial	subluxation	has	been	declining	in	recent	years	and	occurs	
now	in	<10%	of	patients.	Unlike	the	spondyloarthritides	(Chap. 362),	
RA	rarely	affects	the	thoracic	and	lumbar	spine.

Extraarticular	 manifestations	 may	 develop	 during	 the	 clinical	
course	of	RA	in	up	to	40%	of	patients,	even	prior	to	the	onset	of	arthri-
tis	(Fig. 358-2).	Patients	most	likely	to	develop	extraarticular	disease	
have	 a	 history	 of	 cigarette	 smoking,	 have	 early	 onset	 of	 significant	
physical	disability,	and	test	positive	for	serum	RF	or	ACPA.	Subcuta-
neous	nodules,	secondary	Sjögren’s	syndrome,	interstitial	lung	disease	
(ILD),	pulmonary	nodules,	and	anemia	are	among	the	most	frequently	
observed	 extraarticular	 manifestations.	 Recent	 studies	 have	 shown	 a	
decrease	 in	 the	 incidence	 and	 severity	 of	 at	 least	 some	 extraarticular	
manifestations,	particularly	Felty’s	syndrome	and	vasculitis.

The	 most	 common	 systemic	 and	 extraarticular	 features	 of	 RA	 are	

described	in	more	detail	in	the	sections	below.

 ■ CONSTITUTIONAL
These	signs	and	symptoms	include	weight	loss,	fever,	fatigue,	malaise,	
depression,	 and	 in	 the	 most	 severe	 cases,	 cachexia;	 they	 generally	
reflect	a	high	degree	of	inflammation	and	may	even	precede	the	onset	
of	 joint	 symptoms.	 In	 general,	 the	 presence	 of	 a	 fever	 of	 >38.3°C	
(101°F)	at	any	time	during	the	clinical	course	should	raise	suspicion	of	
systemic	vasculitis	(see	below)	or	infection.

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disorders ■ NODULES
Subcutaneous	 nodules	 have	 been	 reported	 to	 occur	 in	 30–40%	 of	
patients	and	more	commonly	in	those	with	the	highest	levels	of	dis-
ease	 activity,	 the	 disease-related	 shared	 epitope	 (SE)	 (see	 below),	 a	
positive	test	for	serum	RF,	and	radiographic	evidence	of	joint	erosions.	
However,	more	recent	cohort	studies	suggest	a	declining	prevalence	of	
subcutaneous	 nodules,	 perhaps	 related	 to	 early	 and	 more	 aggressive	
disease-modifying	therapy.	When	palpated,	the	nodules	are	generally	
firm;	 nontender;	 and	 adherent	 to	 periosteum,	 tendons,	 or	 bursae;	
they	 develop	 in	 areas	 of	 the	 skeleton	 subject	 to	 repeated	 trauma	
or	 irritation	 such	 as	 the	 forearm,	 sacral	 prominences,	 and	 Achilles	
tendon.	 They	 may	 also	 occur	 in	 the	 lungs,	 pleura,	 pericardium,	 and	
peritoneum.	Nodules	are	typically	benign,	although	they	can	be	asso-
ciated	with	infection,	ulceration,	and	gangrene.	Accelerated	growth	of	
smaller	nodules	may	occur	in	up	to	10%	of	patients	taking	long-term	
methotrexate,	 although	 the	 mechanisms	 behind	 this	 phenomenon	 is		
unclear.

 ■ SJÖGREN’S SYNDROME
Secondary	Sjögren’s	syndrome	(Chap. 361)	is	defined	by	the	presence	
of	either	keratoconjunctivitis	sicca	(dry	eyes)	or	xerostomia	(dry	mouth)	
in	 association	 with	 another	 connective	 tissue	 disease,	 such	 as	 RA.	
Approximately	 10%	 of	 patients	 with	 RA	 have	 secondary	 Sjögren’s	
syndrome.

 ■ PULMONARY
Pleuritis,	 the	 most	 common	 pulmonary	 manifestation	 of	 RA,	 may	
produce	pleuritic	chest	pain	and	dyspnea,	as	well	as	a	pleural	friction	
rub	and	effusion.	Pleural	effusions	tend	to	be	exudative	with	increased	
numbers	of	monocytes	and	neutrophils.	ILD	may	also	occur	in	patients	
with	RA	and	is	heralded	by	symptoms	of	dry	cough	and	progressive	
shortness	of	breath.	ILD	can	be	associated	with	cigarette	smoking	and	
is	generally	found	in	patients	with	higher	disease	activity,	although	it	
may	be	diagnosed	in	up	to	3.5%	of	patients	prior	to	the	onset	of	joint	
symptoms.	 Recent	 studies	 have	 shown	 the	 overall	 prevalence	 of	 ILD	
in	RA	to	be	as	high	as	12%.	Diagnosis	is	readily	made	by	high-resolution	
chest	CT	scan,	which	shows	infiltrative	opacification,	or	ground-glass	
opacities,	in	the	periphery	of	both	lungs.	Usual	interstitial	pneumonia	
(UIP)	and	nonspecific	interstitial	pneumonia	(NSIP)	are	the	main	his-
tologic	and	radiologic	patterns	of	ILD.	UIP	causes	progressive	scarring	
of	the	lungs	that,	on	chest	CT	scan,	produces	honeycomb	changes	in	
the	 periphery	 and	 lower	 portions	 of	 the	 lungs.	 In	 contrast,	 the	 most	
common	 radiographic	 changes	 in	 NSIP	 are	 relatively	 symmetric	 and	
bilateral	ground-glass	opacities	with	associated	fine	reticulations,	with	
volume	 loss	 and	 traction	 bronchiectasis.	 In	 both	 cases,	 pulmonary	
function	 testing	 shows	 a	 restrictive	 pattern	 (e.g.,	 reduced	 total	 lung	
capacity)	 with	 a	 reduced	 diffusing	 capacity	 for	 carbon	 monoxide	
(DlCO).	The	presence	of	ILD	confers	a	poor	prognosis.	The	prognosis	
of	ILD	in	RA,	however,	is	not	quite	as	poor	as	that	of	idiopathic	pulmo-
nary	fibrosis	(e.g.,	usual	interstitial	pneumonitis)	and	responds	better	
to	 immunosuppressive	 therapy	 (Chap.  293).	 Pulmonary	 nodules	 are	
also	common	in	patients	with	RA	and	may	be	solitary	or	multiple.	Cap-
lan’s	syndrome	is	a	rare	subset	of	pulmonary	nodulosis	characterized	
by	 the	 development	 of	 nodules	 and	 pneumoconiosis	 following	 silica	
exposure.	Respiratory	bronchiolitis	and	bronchiectasis	are	pulmonary	
disorders	less	commonly	associated	with	RA.

 ■ CARDIAC
The	 most	 frequent	 site	 of	 cardiac	 involvement	 in	 RA	 is	 the	 pericar-
dium.	However,	clinical	manifestations	of	pericarditis	occur	in	<10%	
of	 patients	 with	 RA	 despite	 the	 fact	 that	 pericardial	 involvement	 is	
detectable	 in	 nearly	 one-half	 of	 cases	 by	 echocardiogram	 or	 autopsy	
studies.	 Up	 to	 20%	 of	 patients	 with	 RA	 may	 have	 asymptomatic	
pericardial	 effusions	 on	 echocardiography.	 Cardiomyopathy,	 another	
clinically	important	manifestation	of	RA,	may	result	from	necrotizing	
or	 granulomatous	 myocarditis,	 coronary	 artery	 disease,	 or	 diastolic	
dysfunction.	This	involvement	too	may	be	subclinical	and	only	iden-
tified	 by	 echocardiography	 or	 cardiac	 MRI.	 Rarely,	 the	 heart	 muscle	
may	contain	rheumatoid	nodules	or	be	infiltrated	with	amyloid.	Mitral	

regurgitation	is	the	most	common	valvular	abnormality	in	RA,	occur-
ring	at	a	higher	frequency	than	in	the	general	population.

2753

 ■ VASCULITIS
Rheumatoid	 vasculitis	 (Chap.  363)	 typically	 occurs	 in	 patients	 with	
long-standing	disease,	a	positive	test	for	serum	RF	or	anti–cyclic	cit-
rullinated	peptide	(CCP)	antibodies,	and	hypocomplementemia.	The	
overall	incidence	has	decreased	significantly	in	the	past	decade	to	<1%	
of	patients.	The	cutaneous	signs	vary	and	include	petechiae,	purpura,	
digital	infarcts,	gangrene,	livedo	reticularis,	and	in	severe	cases	large,	
painful	 lower	 extremity	 ulcerations.	 Vasculitic	 ulcers,	 which	 may	 be	
difficult	 to	 distinguish	 from	 those	 caused	 by	 venous	 insufficiency,	
may	be	treated	successfully	with	immunosuppressive	agents	(requiring	
cytotoxic	treatment	in	severe	cases)	as	well	as	skin	grafting.	Sensori-
motor	polyneuropathies,	such	as	mononeuritis	multiplex,	may	occur	in	
association	with	systemic	rheumatoid	vasculitis	and	usually	clinically	
present	with	a	new	onset	of	numbness,	tingling,	or	focal	muscle	weak-
ness	depending	on	its	severity.

 ■ HEMATOLOGIC
A	normochromic,	normocytic	anemia	often	develops	in	patients	with	
RA	and	is	the	most	common	hematologic	abnormality.	The	degree	of	
anemia	parallels	the	degree	of	inflammation,	correlating	with	the	levels	
of	serum	C-reactive	protein	(CRP)	and	erythrocyte	sedimentation	rate	
(ESR).	 Platelet	 counts	 may	 also	 be	 elevated	 in	 RA	 as	 an	 acute-phase	
reactant.	Immune-mediated	thrombocytopenia	is	rare	in	this	disease.
Felty’s syndrome	is	defined	by	the	clinical	triad	of	neutropenia,	sple-
nomegaly,	and	nodular	RA	and	is	seen	in	<1%	of	patients,	although	its	
incidence	appears	to	be	declining	in	the	face	of	more	aggressive	treat-
ment	of	the	joint	disease.	It	typically	occurs	in	the	late	stages	of	severe	
RA	and	is	more	common	in	whites	than	other	racial	groups.	T-cell	large	
granular	 lymphocyte	 leukemia	 (T-LGL)	 may	 have	 a	 similar	 clinical	
presentation	and	often	occurs	in	association	with	RA.	T-LGL	is	char-
acterized	by	a	chronic,	indolent	clonal	growth	of	LGL	cells,	leading	to	
neutropenia	and	splenomegaly.	As	opposed	to	Felty’s	syndrome,	T-LGL	
may	develop	early	in	the	course	of	RA.	Leukopenia	apart	from	these	
disorders	is	uncommon	and	most	often	a	side	effect	of	drug	therapy.

 ■ LYMPHOMA
Large	cohort	studies	have	shown	a	two-	to	fourfold	increased	risk	of	
lymphoma	in	RA	patients	compared	with	the	general	population.	The	
most	 common	 histopathologic	 type	 of	 lymphoma	 is	 a	 diffuse	 large	
B-cell	 lymphoma.	 The	 risk	 of	 developing	 lymphoma	 increases	 if	 the	
patient	has	high	levels	of	disease	activity	or	Felty’s	syndrome.

 ■ ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS
In	 addition	 to	 extraarticular	 manifestations,	 several	 conditions	 asso-
ciated	 with	 RA	 contribute	 to	 disease	 morbidity	 and	 mortality	 rates.	
They	 are	 worthy	 of	 mention	 because	 they	 affect	 chronic	 disease	
management.

Cardiovascular  Disease  The	 most	 common	 cause	 of	 death	 in	
patients	with	RA	is	cardiovascular	disease.	The	incidence	of	coronary	
artery	disease	and	carotid	atherosclerosis	is	higher	in	RA	patients	than	
in	 the	 general	 population	 even	 when	 controlling	 for	 traditional	 car-
diac	risk	factors,	such	as	hypertension,	obesity,	hypercholesterolemia,	
diabetes,	and	cigarette	smoking.	Furthermore,	congestive	heart	failure	
(including	both	systolic	and	diastolic	dysfunction)	occurs	at	an	approx-
imately	twofold	higher	rate	in	RA	than	in	the	general	population.	The	
presence	 of	 elevated	 serum	 inflammatory	 markers	 appears	 to	 confer	
an	increased	risk	of	cardiovascular	disease	in	this	disease	population.

Osteoporosis  Osteoporosis	 is	 more	 common	 in	 patients	 with	
RA	than	an	age-	and	sex-matched	population,	with	an	incidence	rate	
of	 nearly	 double	 that	 of	 the	 healthy	 population	 and	 a	 prevalence	 of	
approximately	 one-third	 in	 postmenopausal	 women	 with	 RA.	 There	
is	also	an	increased	risk	of	fragility	fracture,	with	a	greater	risk	among	
women.	The	inflammatory	milieu	of	the	joint	probably	spills	over	into	
the	 rest	 of	 the	 body	 and	 promotes	 generalized	 bone	 loss	 by	 activat-
ing	osteoclasts.	Both	trabecular	and	cortical	bone	are	affected	by	the	

HPIM21e_Part11_p2671-p2880.indd   2753

2754 inflammatory	 response,	 with	 cortical	 sites	 more	 susceptible	 to	 bone	
loss.	Chronic	use	of	glucocorticoids	and	disability-related	immobility	
also	contribute	to	osteoporosis.	Hip	fractures	are	more	likely	to	occur	
in	patients	with	RA	and	are	significant	predictors	of	increased	disabil-
ity	and	mortality	rate	in	this	disease.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
RA	affects	~0.5–1%	of	the	adult	population	worldwide.	There	is	evi-
dence	that	the	overall	incidence	of	RA	has	been	decreasing	in	recent	
decades,	whereas	the	prevalence	has	remained	the	same	because	indi-
viduals	with	RA	are	living	longer.	The	incidence	and	prevalence	of	RA	
vary	 based	 on	 geographic	 location,	 both	 globally	 and	 among	 certain	
ethnic	groups	within	a	country	(Fig. 358-3).	For	example,	the	Native	
American	Yakima,	Pima,	and	Chippewa	tribes	of	North	America	have	
reported	 prevalence	 rates	 in	 some	 studies	 of	 nearly	 7%.	 In	 contrast,	
many	population	studies	from	Africa	and	Asia	show	lower	prevalence	
rates	for	RA	in	the	range	of	0.2–0.4%.

Like	many	other	autoimmune	diseases,	RA	occurs	more	commonly	
in	females	than	in	males,	with	a	2–3:1	ratio.	Interestingly,	studies	of	RA	
from	some	of	the	Latin	American	and	African	countries	show	an	even	
greater	predominance	of	disease	in	females	compared	to	males,	with	
ratios	of	6–8:1.	Given	this	preponderance	of	females,	various	theories	
have	been	proposed	to	explain	the	possible	role	of	estrogen	in	disease	
pathogenesis.	Broadly	speaking,	most	of	the	theories	center	on	the	role	
of	estrogens	and	androgens	in	enhancing	and	suppressing	the	immune	
response,	respectively.	However,	estrogens	have	both	stimulatory	and	
inhibitory	 effects	 on	 the	 immune	 system,	 and	 the	 hormonal	 mecha-
nisms,	if	any,	influencing	the	development	of	RA	are	unknown

GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS

It	has	been	recognized	for	>30	years	that	genetic	factors	contribute	
to	the	occurrence	of	RA	as	well	as	to	its	severity.	The	likelihood	that	
a	first-degree	relative	of	a	patient	will	share	the	diagnosis	of	RA	is	
2–10	times	greater	than	in	the	general	population.	There	remains,	how-
ever,	some	uncertainty	in	the	extent	to	which	genetics	plays	a	role	in	the	
causative	mechanisms	of	RA.	Heritability	estimates	range	from	40	to	50%	
and	are	approximately	the	same	for	autoantibody-positive	and	-negative	
individuals.	 The	 estimate	 of	 genetic	 influence	 may	 vary	 across	 studies	
due	to	gene–environment	interactions.

The	 alleles	 known	 to	 confer	 the	 greatest	 risk	 of	 RA	 are	 located	
within	 the	 major	 histocompatibility	 complex	 (MHC)	 and,	 in	 partic-
ular,	 MHC	 class	 II	 molecules.	 MHC	 class	 II	 molecules	 are	 typically	

expressed	 on	 antigen-presenting	 cells	 and	 are	 comprised	 of	 α	 and	 β	
chains.	Most,	but	probably	not	all,	of	this	risk	is	associated	with	allelic	
variation	in	the	HLA-DRB1	gene,	which	encodes	the	MHC	II	β-chain	
molecule.	 The	 disease-associated	 HLA-DRB1	 alleles	 share	 an	 amino	
acid	sequence	at	positions	70–74	in	the	third	hypervariable	regions	of	
the	HLA-DR	β-chain,	termed	the	shared epitope.	These	amino	acids	are	
located	in	the	antigen-binding	grove	with	the	hypervariable	regions	of	
the	HLA-DRβ1	molecule.	Hypervariable	regions	within	DR	molecules	
are	 particularly	 important	 for	 determining	 antigen	 recognition	 and	
binding	 of	 the	 MHC-peptide	 complex	 to	 the	 T-cell	 receptor	 (TCR).	
Peptides	 derived	 from	 posttranslationally	 modified	 proteins	 (via	 cit-
rullination,	acetylation,	or	carbamylation,	for	example)	may	bind	with	
greater	avidity	to	the	shared	epitope,	providing	a	potential	mechanism	
for	increased	disease	risk	at	a	molecular	level.

Carriership	of	the	SE	alleles	is	associated	with	production	of	anti-
ACPA	and	worse	disease	outcomes.	Some	of	these	HLA-DRB1	alleles	
bestow	 a	 high	 risk	 of	 disease	 (*0401),	 whereas	 others	 confer	 a	 more	
moderate	 risk	 (*0101,	 0404,	 1001,	 and	 0901).	 Over	 90%	 of	 patients	
with	 RA	 express	 at	 least	 one	 of	 these	 variants.	 Interestingly,	 HLA-
DRB1*1301	and	to	a	lesser	extent	HLA-DRB1*1302	confer	protection	
from	ACPA-positive	RA.

Additionally,	there	is	geographic	variation	in	disease	susceptibility	
and	the	identity	of	the	HLA-DRB1	risk	alleles.	In	Greece,	for	example,	
where	RA	tends	to	be	milder	than	in	western	European	countries,	RA	
susceptibility	 has	 been	 associated	 with	 the	 *0101	 SE	 allele.	 By	 com-
parison,	the	 *0401	or	 *0404	alleles	are	found	in	~50–70%	of	northern	
Europeans	 and	 are	 the	 predominant	 risk	 alleles	 in	 this	 group.	 The	
most	 common	 disease	 susceptibility	 SE	 alleles	 in	 Asians,	 namely	 the	
Japanese,	 Koreans,	 and	 Chinese,	 are	 *0405	 and	 *0901.	 Lastly,	 disease	
susceptibility	 of	 Native	 American	 populations	 such	 as	 the	 Pima	 and	
Tlingit	Indians,	where	the	prevalence	of	RA	can	be	as	high	as	7%,	is	
associated	with	the	SE	allele	*1042.	The	risk	of	RA	conferred	by	these	
SE	alleles	is	less	in	African	and	Hispanic	Americans	than	in	individuals	
of	European	ancestry.

Genome-wide	association	studies	(GWAS)	have	made	possible	the	
identification	of	several	non-MHC-related	genes	that	contribute	to	RA	
susceptibility.	 GWAS	 are	 based	 on	 the	 detection	 of	 single	 nucleotide	
polymorphisms	 (SNPs),	 which	 allow	 for	 examination	 of	 the	 genetic	
architecture	 of	 complex	 diseases	 such	 as	 RA.	 There	 are	 ~10	 million	
common	 SNPs	 within	 a	 human	 genome	 consisting	 of	 3	 billion	 base	
pairs.	As	a	rule,	GWAS	identify	only	common	variants,	namely,	those	
with	a	frequency	of	>5%	in	the	general	population.

Overall,	 several	 themes	 have	 emerged	 from	 GWAS	 in	 RA.	 First,	
among	the	>100	non-MHC	loci	identified	as	risk	alleles	for	RA,	they	
individually	 have	 only	 a	 modest	 effect	 on	 risk;	 they	 also	 contribute	
to	the	risk	for	developing	other	autoimmune	diseases,	such	as	type	1	
diabetes	mellitus,	systemic	lupus	erythematosus,	and	multiple	sclerosis.	
Second,	although	most	of	the	non-HLA	associations	are	described	in	
patients	with	ACPA-positive	disease,	there	are	several	risk	loci	that	are	
unique	to	ACPA-negative	disease.	Third,	risk	alleles	vary	among	eth-
nic	groups.	And	fourth,	the	risk	loci	mostly	reside	in	genes	encoding	
proteins	involved	in	the	regulation	of	the	immune	response.	However,	
the	risk	alleles	identified	by	GWAS	only	account	at	present	for	~5%	of	
the	genetic	risk,	suggesting	that	rare	variants	or	other	classes	of	DNA	
variants,	such	as	variants	in	copy	number,	may	be	yet	found	that	sig-
nificantly	contribute	to	the	overall	risk	model.

Among	 the	 best	 examples	 of	 the	 non-MHC	 genes	 contributing	
to	 the	 risk	 of	 RA	 is	 the	 gene	 encoding	 protein	 tyrosine	 phosphatase	
non-receptor	 22	 (PTPN22).	 This	 gene	 varies	 in	 frequency	 among	
patients	from	different	parts	of	Europe	(e.g.,	3–10%)	but	is	absent	in	
patients	 of	 East	 Asian	 ancestry.	 PTPN22	 encodes	 lymphoid	 tyrosine	
phosphatase,	 a	 protein	 that	 regulates	 T-	 and	 B-cell	 function.	 Inheri-
tance	of	the	risk	allele	for	PTPN22	produces	a	gain-of-function	in	the	
protein	that	is	hypothesized	to	result	in	the	abnormal	thymic	selection	
of	autoreactive	T	and	B	cells	and	appears	to	be	associated	exclusively	
with	ACPA-positive	disease.	The	peptidyl	arginine	deiminase	type	IV	
(PADI4)	 gene	 is	 another	 risk	 allele	 that	 encodes	 an	 enzyme	 involved	
in	 the	 conversion	 of	 arginine	 to	 citrulline	 and	 is	 postulated	 to	 play	
a	 role	 in	 the	 development	 of	 antibodies	 to	 citrullinated	 antigens.	 A	
polymorphism	in	PADI4	has	been	associated	with	a	twofold	increase	
in	the	risk	of	RA,	primarily	in	those	of	East	Asian	descent.	Recently,	
polymorphisms	in	apolipoprotein	M	(APOM)	have	been	demonstrated	
in	an	East	Asian	population	to	confer	an	increased	risk	for	RA	as	well	
as	risk	for	dyslipidemia,	independent	of	RA	disease	activity.

In	addition	to	PTPN22,	other	genes	associated	with	B-cell	function	
and/or	 antigen	 presentation	 such	 as	 BTLA	 (B-	 and	 T-lymphocyte	
attenuator),	 Fc	 receptors,	 and	 CD40	 have	 been	 identified.	 Signal	
transduction	genes	and	pathways	that	regulate	immune	function	(e.g.,	
TRAF1-C5	 and	 STAT4),	 cell	 migration	 (ELMO1)	 and	 fetal	 develop-
ment	(LBH)	have	also	been	discovered	to	be	linked	to	RA.	Other	risk	
alleles	affect	cytokine	signaling,	such	as	tumor	necrosis	factor	(TNF)	
promoter	 polymorphisms	 that	 can	 potentially	 modulate	 TNF	 gene	
expression	 and	 an	 interleukin	 (IL)	 6	 receptor	 polymorphism	 that	 is	
functionally	 implicated	 in	 the	 strength	 of	 IL-6	 signaling.	 Thus,	 the	
genetic	clues	implicate	both	adaptive	and	innate	immune	mechanisms	
in	disease	pathogenesis.

Epigenetics	is	the	study	of	heritable	traits	that	affect	gene	expression	
but	do	not	modify	DNA	sequence.	It	may	provide	a	link	between	envi-
ronmental	 exposure	 and	 predisposition	 to	 disease.	 Epigenetic	 mech-
anisms	 are	 theoretically	 involved	 in	 three	 important	 aspects	 of	 RA:	
contribution	to	disease	etiology,	perpetuation	of	chronic	inflammatory	
responses,	 and	 disease	 severity.	 The	 best-studied	 epigenetic	 mech-
anisms	 are	 those	 regulating	 posttranslational	 histone	 modifications	
and	 DNA	 methylation.	 DNA	 methylation	 patterns	 have	 been	 shown	
to	 differ	 between	 RA	 patients	 and	 healthy	 controls,	 as	 well	 as	 from	
patients	with	osteoarthritis.	MicroRNAs,	which	are	noncoding	RNAs	
that	 function	 as	 posttranscriptional	 regulators	 of	 gene	 expression,	
represent	 an	 additional	 epigenetic	 mechanism	 that	 may	 potentially	
influence	cellular	responses.	Many	microRNAs	have	been	identified	as	
contributing	to	the	activated	phenotype	of	synovial	fibroblasts,	such	as	
miR146a	or	miR155.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
In	addition	to	genetic	predisposition,	a	host	of	environmental	factors	
have	been	implicated	in	the	pathogenesis	of	RA.	The	most	reproducible	
of	 these	 environmental	 links	 is	 cigarette	 smoking.	 Numerous	 cohort	
and	 case-control	 studies	 have	 demonstrated	 that	 smoking	 confers	 a	
relative	risk	for	developing	RA	of	1.5–3.5	times.	Smoking-related	risk	
interacts	 in	 a	 synergistic	 manner	 with	 MHC	 risk	 alleles.	 The	 classic	
shared	epitope	alleles	alone	modestly	increase	the	likelihood	of	devel-
oping	 RA	 by	 four-	 to	 sixfold;	 however,	 this	 risk	 increases	 to	 20-	 to	

40-fold	 when	 combined	 with	 smoking.	 In	 particular,	 women	 who	
smoke	cigarettes	have	a	nearly	2.5	times	greater	risk	of	RA,	a	risk	that	
persists	even	15	years	after	smoking	cessation.	A	twin	who	smokes	will	
have	 a	 significantly	 higher	 risk	 for	 RA	 than	 his	 or	 her	 monozygotic	
co-twin,	theoretically	with	the	same	genetic	risk,	who	does	not	smoke.	
Interestingly,	 the	 risk	 from	 smoking	 is	 almost	 exclusively	 related	 to	
RF	 and	 ACPA-positive	 disease.	 However,	 it	 has	 not	 been	 shown	 that	
smoking	cessation,	while	having	many	health	benefits,	improves	dis-
ease	 activity.	 Inhalant-related	 occupations	 and	 silica	 inhalants	 also	
may	increase	RA	risk.	These	observations	have	led	to	the	theory	that	
lung	 disease	 may	 play	 a	 critical	 early	 role	 in	 the	 initial	 development	
of	 autoreactive	 immune	 cells,	 as	 well	 as	 to	 the	 known	 occurrence	 of	
autoantibodies	more	than	a	decade	prior	to	the	clinical	development	
of	joint	disease.

Researchers	 began	 to	 aggressively	 seek	 an	 infectious	 etiology	 for	
RA	 after	 the	 discovery	 in	 1931	 that	 sera	 from	 patients	 with	 this	 dis-
ease	could	agglutinate	strains	of	streptococci.	Certain	viruses	such	as	
Epstein-Barr	virus	(EBV)	have	garnered	the	most	interest	over	the	past	
30	 years	 given	 their	 ubiquity,	 ability	 to	 persist	 for	 many	 years	 in	 the	
host,	and	frequent	association	with	arthritic	complaints.	For	example,	
titers	of	IgG	antibodies	against	EBV	antigens	in	the	peripheral	blood	
and	saliva	are	significantly	higher	in	patients	with	RA	than	the	general	
population.	EBV	DNA	has	also	been	found	in	synovial	fluid	and	syno-
vial	cells	of	RA	patients.	Because	the	evidence	for	these	links	is	largely	
circumstantial,	it	has	not	been	possible	to	directly	implicate	infection	
as	a	causative	factor	in	RA.

An	attractive	hypothesis	is	that	microbial	dysbiosis	of	the	oral	or	gut	
microbiome	may	predispose	to	the	development	of	RA.	Recent	studies	
suggest	that	periodontitis	in	the	oral	cavity	may	play	a	role	in	disease	
mechanisms.	 Multiple	 studies	 provide	 evidence	 for	 a	 link	 between	
ACPA-positive	 RA	 and	 cigarette	 smoking,	 periodontal	 disease,	 and	
the	oral	microbiome,	specifically	Porphyromonas gingivalis.	It	has	been	
hypothesized	that	the	immune	response	to	P. gingivalis	may	trigger	the	
development	of	RA	and	that	induction	of	ACPA	results	from	citrullina-
tion	of	arginine	residues	in	human	tissues	by	the	bacterial	enzyme	pep-
tidyl	arginine	deiminase	(PAD).	Interestingly,	P. gingivalis	is	the	only	
oral	bacterial	species	known	to	harbor	this	enzyme.	Some	studies	have	
shown	a	relationship	between	circulating	antibodies	to	P. gingivalis	and	
RA,	as	well	as	these	antibodies	and	first-degree	relatives	at	risk	for	this	
disease.	However,	it	remains	unproven	whether	the	observed	dysbiosis	
in	the	oral	cavity	precedes	the	development	of	disease,	and	results	from	
other	studies	argue	against	a	causal	link	between	periodontitis	and	the	
development	of	RA.

There	are	also	limited	data	suggesting	a	role	for	the	gut	microbiome	
in	 the	 etiology	 of	 RA.	 Some	 studies	 have	 found	 that	 the	 gut	 micro-
biome	is	different	in	patients	with	early	RA	compared	with	controls.	
In	 particular,	 Prevotella  copri	 was	 reported	 to	 be	 enriched	 in	 early	
untreated	RA	as	well	as	an	“at-risk”	population.	On	the	other	hand,	a	
common	dysbiotic	signature	does	not	seem	to	predominate	in	patients	
with	 RA,	 and	 evidence	 is	 lacking	 for	 direct	 immune-modulating		
mechanisms.

PATHOLOGY
RA	affects	the	synovial	tissue	primarily	of	the	diarthrodial	joints	and	
underlying	cartilage	and	bone.	The	synovial	membrane,	which	covers	
most	articular	surfaces,	tendon	sheaths,	and	bursae,	normally	is	a	thin	
layer	 of	 connective	 tissue.	 In	 joints,	 it	 faces	 the	 bone	 and	 cartilage,	
bridging	the	opposing	bony	surfaces	and	inserting	at	periosteal	regions	
close	to	the	articular	cartilage.	It	consists	primarily	of	two	cell	types—
type	 A	 synoviocytes	 (macrophage-derived)	 and	 type	 B	 synoviocytes	
(fibroblast-derived).	 The	 synovial	 fibroblasts	 are	 the	 most	 abundant	
and	produce	the	structural	components	of	joints,	including	collagen,	
fibronectin,	 and	 laminin,	 as	 well	 as	 other	 extracellular	 constituents	
of	 the	 synovial	 matrix.	 The	 sublining	 layer	 consists	 of	 blood	 vessels	
and	a	sparse	population	of	mononuclear	cells	within	a	loose	network	
of	 connective	 tissue.	 Synovial	 fluid,	 an	 ultrafiltrate	 of	 blood,	 diffuses	
through	 the	 subsynovial	 lining	 tissue	 across	 the	 synovial	 membrane	
and	 into	 the	 joint	 cavity.	 Its	 main	 constituents	 are	 hyaluronan	 and	
lubricin.	 Hyaluronan	 is	 a	 glycosaminoglycan	 that	 contributes	 to	 the

2756 viscous	nature	of	synovial	fluid,	which,	along	with	lubricin,	lubricates	

the	surface	of	the	articular	cartilage.

The	 pathologic	 hallmarks	 of	 RA	 are	 synovial	 inflammation	 and	
proliferation,	focal	bone	erosions,	and	thinning	of	articular	cartilage.	
Chronic	 inflammation	 leads	 to	 synovial	 lining	 hyperplasia	 and	 the	
formation	of	pannus,	a	thickened	cellular	membrane	containing	mul-
tiple	 layers	 of	 fibroblast-like	 synoviocytes	 and	 granulation-reactive	
fibrovascular	tissue	that	invades	the	underlying	cartilage	and	bone.	The	
inflammatory	infiltrate	is	made	up	of	no	less	than	six	cell	types:	T	cells,	
B	cells,	plasma	cells,	dendritic	cells,	mast	cells,	and,	to	a	lesser	extent,	
granulocytes.	The	T	cells	compose	30–50%	of	the	infiltrate,	with	the	
other	cells	accounting	for	the	remainder.	The	topographical	organiza-
tion	of	these	cells	is	complex	and	may	vary	among	individuals	with	RA.	
Most	often,	the	lymphocytes	are	diffusely	organized	among	the	tissue	
resident	cells;	however,	in	some	cases,	the	B	cells,	T	cells,	and	dendritic	
cells	may	form	higher	levels	of	organization,	such	as	lymphoid	follicles	
and	germinal	center–like	structures.	Growth	factors	secreted	by	syno-
vial	fibroblasts	and	macrophages	promote	the	formation	of	new	blood	
vessels	in	the	synovial	sublining	that	supply	the	increasing	demands	for	
oxygenation	and	nutrition	required	by	the	infiltrating	leukocytes	and	
expanding	synovial	tissue.

The	structural	damage	to	the	mineralized	cartilage	and	subchondral	
bone	 is	 mediated	 by	 the	 osteoclast.	 Osteoclasts	 are	 multinucleated	
giant	cells	that	can	be	identified	by	their	expression	of	CD68,	tartrate-	
resistant	 acid	 phosphatase,	 cathepsin	 K,	 and	 the	 calcitonin	 receptor.	
They	appear	at	the	pannus-bone	interface	where	they	eventually	form	
resorption	lacunae.	These	lesions	typically	localize	where	the	synovial	
membrane	inserts	into	the	periosteal	surface	at	the	edges	of	bones	close	
to	the	rim	of	articular	cartilage	and	at	the	attachment	sites	of	ligaments	
and	tendon	sheaths.	This	process	most	likely	explains	why	bone	ero-
sions	usually	develop	at	the	radial	sites	of	the	MCP	joints	juxtaposed	
to	the	insertion	sites	of	the	tendons,	collateral	ligaments,	and	synovial	
membrane.	Another	form	of	bone	loss	is	periarticular	osteopenia	that	
occurs	in	joints	with	active	inflammation.	It	is	associated	with	substan-
tial	 thinning	 of	 the	 bony	 trabeculae	 along	 the	 metaphyses	 of	 bones,	
and	likely	results	from	inflammation	of	the	bone	marrow	cavity.	These	
lesions	 can	 be	 visualized	 on	 MRI	 scans,	 where	 they	 appear	 as	 signal	
alterations	in	the	bone	marrow	adjacent	to	inflamed	joints.	Their	signal	
characteristics	show	they	are	water-rich	with	a	low-fat	content	and	are	
consistent	 with	 highly	 vascularized	 inflammatory	 tissue.	 These	 bone	
marrow	lesions	are	often	the	forerunner	of	bone	erosions.

The	 cortical	 bone	 layer	 that	 separates	 the	 bone	 marrow	 from	 the	
invading	pannus	is	relatively	thin	and	susceptible	to	penetration	by	the	
inflamed	synovium.	The	bone	marrow	lesions	seen	on	MRI	scans	are	
associated	with	an	endosteal	bone	response	characterized	by	the	accu-
mulation	of	osteoblasts	and	deposition	of	osteoid.	Finally,	generalized	
osteoporosis,	which	results	in	the	thinning	of	trabecular	bone	through-
out	the	body,	is	a	third	form	of	bone	loss	found	in	patients	with	RA.

Articular	cartilage	is	an	avascular	tissue	comprised	of	a	specialized	
matrix	of	collagens,	proteoglycans,	and	other	proteins.	It	is	organized	
in	four	distinct	regions	(superficial,	middle,	deep,	and	calcified	carti-
lage	 zones)—chondrocytes	 constitute	 the	 unique	 cellular	 component	
in	 these	 layers.	 Originally,	 cartilage	 was	 considered	 to	 be	 an	 inert	
tissue,	but	it	is	now	known	to	be	a	highly	responsive	tissue	that	reacts	
to	 inflammatory	 mediators	 and	 mechanical	 factors,	 which	 in	 turn,	
alter	the	balance	between	cartilage	anabolism	and	catabolism.	In	RA,	
the	initial	areas	of	cartilage	degradation	are	juxtaposed	to	the	synovial	
pannus.	The	cartilage	matrix	is	characterized	by	a	generalized	loss	of	
proteoglycan,	 most	 evident	 in	 the	 superficial	 zones	 adjacent	 to	 the	
synovial	fluid.	Degradation	of	cartilage	may	also	take	place	in	the	per-
ichondrocytic	zone	and	in	regions	adjacent	to	the	subchondral	bone.

PATHOGENESIS
The	 pathogenic	 mechanisms	 of	 synovial	 inflammation	 are	 likely	 to	
result	from	a	complex	interplay	of	genetic,	environmental,	and	immu-
nologic	factors	that	produces	dysregulation	of	the	immune	system	and	
a	 breakdown	 in	 self-tolerance	 (Fig.  358-4).	 Precisely	 what	 triggers	
these	 initiating	 events	 and	 what	 genetic	 and	 environmental	 factors	
disrupt	 the	 immune	 system	 remain	 a	 mystery.	 However,	 a	 detailed	

molecular	 picture	 is	 emerging	 of	 the	 mechanisms	 underlying	 the	
chronic	 inflammatory	 response	 and	 the	 destruction	 of	 the	 articular	
cartilage	and	bone.

In	RA,	the	preclinical	stage	appears	to	be	characterized	by	a	break-
down	in	self-tolerance.	This	idea	is	supported	by	the	finding	that	auto-
antibodies,	such	as	RF	and	ACPA,	may	be	found	in	sera	from	patients	
many	 years	 before	 onset	 of	 clinical	 disease.	 However,	 the	 antigenic	
targets	of	ACPA	and	RF	are	not	restricted	to	the	joint,	and	their	role	
in	disease	pathogenesis	remains	speculative.	ACPA	are	directed	against	
deaminated	peptides,	which	result	from	posttranslational	modification	
by	the	enzyme	PADI4.	They	recognize	citrulline-containing	regions	of	
several	 different	 matrix	 proteins,	 including	 filaggrin,	 keratin,	 fibrin-
ogen,	and	vimentin,	and	are	present	at	higher	levels	in	the	joint	fluid	
compared	 to	 the	 serum.	 Other	 autoantibodies	 have	 been	 found	 in	 a	
minority	of	patients	with	RA,	but	they	also	occur	in	the	setting	of	other	
types	of	arthritis.	They	bind	to	a	diverse	array	of	autoantigens,	includ-
ing	 type	 II	 collagen,	 human	 cartilage	 gp-39,	 aggrecan,	 calpastatin,	
immunoglobulin	 binding	 protein	 (BiP),	 and	 glucose-6-phosphate	
isomerase.

In	theory,	environmental	stimulants	may	synergize	with	other	fac-
tors	 to	 bring	 about	 inflammation	 in	 RA.	 People	 who	 smoke	 display	
higher	 citrullination	 of	 proteins	 in	 bronchoalveolar	 fluid	 than	 those	
who	do	not	smoke.	Thus,	it	has	been	speculated	that	long-term	expo-
sure	to	tobacco	smoke	might	induce	citrullination	of	cellular	proteins	
via	increased	PADI	expression	in	the	lung	and	generate	a	neoepitope	
capable	of	inducing	self-reactivity,	which	in	turns,	leads	to	formation	
of	immune	complexes	that	trigger	joint	inflammation.

How	might	microbes	or	their	products	be	involved	in	the	initiating	
events	of	RA?	The	immune	system	is	alerted	to	the	presence	of	micro-
bial	infections	through	the	binding	of	pathogen-associated	molecular	
patterns	 (PAMPs)	 to	 Toll-like	 receptors	 (TLRs).	 There	 are	 10	 TLRs	
in	 humans	 that	 recognize	 a	 variety	 of	 microbial	 products,	 including	
bacterial	 cell-surface	 lipopolysaccharides	 and	 heat-shock	 proteins	
(TLR4),	lipoproteins	(TLR2),	double-strand	RNA	viruses	(TLR3),	and	
unmethylated	 CpG	 DNA	 from	 bacteria	 (TLR9).	 TLR2,	 3,	 and	 4	 are	
abundantly	 expressed	 by	 synovial	 fibroblasts	 in	 early	 RA	 and,	 when	
bound	 by	 their	 ligands,	 upregulate	 production	 of	 proinflammatory	
cytokines.	Although	TLR	ligands	may	theoretically	amplify	inflamma-
tory	pathways	in	RA,	their	specific	role	in	disease	pathogenesis	remains	
uncertain.

The	pathogenesis	of	RA	is	built	upon	the	concept	that	self-reactive		
T	cells	drive	the	chronic	inflammatory	response.	In	theory,	self-reactive	
T	 cells	 might	 arise	 in	 RA	 from	 abnormal	 central	 (thymic)	 selection	
or	intrinsic	defects	lowering	the	threshold	in	the	periphery	for	T-cell	
activation.	 Either	 mechanism	 might	 result	 in	 abnormal	 expansion	 of	
the	self-reactive	T-cell	repertoire	and	a	breakdown	in	T-cell	tolerance.	
The	support	for	these	theories	comes	mainly	from	studies	of	arthritis	
in	 mouse	 models.	 It	 has	 not	 been	 shown	 that	 patients	 with	 RA	 have	
abnormal	thymic	selection	of	T	cells	or	defective	apoptotic	pathways	
regulating	cell	death.	At	least	some	antigen	stimulation	inside	the	joint	
seems	likely,	owing	to	the	fact	that	T	cells	in	the	synovium	express	a	
cell-surface	 phenotype	 indicating	 prior	 antigen	 exposure	 and	 show	
evidence	of	clonal	expansion.	Of	interest,	peripheral	blood	T	cells	from	
patients	with	RA	have	been	shown	to	display	a	fingerprint	of	premature	
aging	that	mostly	affects	inexperienced	naïve	T	cells.	In	these	studies,	
the	most	glaring	findings	have	been	the	loss	of	telomeric	sequences	and	
a	decrease	in	the	thymic	output	of	new	T	cells.	Although	intriguing,	
it	 is	 not	 clear	 how	 generalized	 T-cell	 abnormalities	 might	 provoke	 a	
systemic	disease	with	a	predominance	of	synovitis.

There	is	substantial	evidence	of	a	role	for	CD4+	T	cells	in	the	patho-
genesis	of	RA.	First,	the	co-receptor	CD4	on	the	surface	of	T	cells	binds	
to	 invariant	 sites	 on	 MHC	 class	 II	 molecules,	 stabilizing	 the	 MHC-	
peptide–T-cell	receptor	complex	during	T-cell	activation.	Because	the	
SE	on	MHC	class	II	molecules	is	a	risk	factor	for	RA,	it	follows	that	
CD4+	 T-cell	 activation	 may	 play	 a	 role	 in	 the	 pathogenesis	 of	 this	
disease.	 Second,	 CD4+	 memory	 T	 cells	 are	 enriched	 in	 the	 synovial	
tissue	from	patients	with	RA	and	can	be	implicated	through	“guilt	by	
association.”	Third,	CD4+	T	cells	have	been	shown	to	be	important	in	
the	initiation	of	arthritis	in	animal	models.	Fourth,	some,	but	not	all,

FIGURE 358-4  Pathophysiologic mechanisms of inflammation and joint destruction. Genetic predisposition along with environmental factors may trigger the development 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with subsequent synovial T-cell activation. CD4+ T cells become activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through interactions between 
the T-cell receptor and class II MHC-peptide antigen (signal 1) with co-stimulation through the CD28-CD80/86 pathway, as well as other pathways (signal 2). In theory, 
ligands binding Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may further stimulate activation of APCs inside the joint. Synovial CD4+ T cells differentiate into TH1 and TH17 cells, each with their 
distinctive cytokine profile. CD4+ TH cells in turn activate B cells, some of which are destined to differentiate into autoantibody-producing plasma cells. Immune complexes, 
possibly comprised of rheumatoid factors (RFs) and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) antibodies, may form inside the joint, activating the complement pathway and 
amplifying inflammation. T effector cells stimulate synovial macrophages (M) and fibroblasts (SF) to secrete proinflammatory mediators, among which is tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNF-α). TNF-α upregulates adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, promoting leukocyte influx into the joint. It also stimulates the production of other inflammatory 
mediators, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). TNF-α has a critically important function in regulating the 
balance between bone destruction and formation. It upregulates the expression of dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), which can then internalize Wnt receptors on osteoblast precursors. 
Wnt is a soluble mediator that promotes osteoblastogenesis and bone formation. In RA, bone formation is inhibited through the Wnt pathway, presumably due to the action 
of elevated levels of DKK-1. In addition to inhibiting bone formation, TNF-α stimulates osteoclastogenesis. However, it is not sufficient by itself to induce the differentiation 
of osteoclast precursors (Pre-OC) into activated osteoclasts capable of eroding bone. Osteoclast differentiation requires the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL), which binds to RANK on the surface of Pre-OC. Inside the joint, RANKL is mainly derived 
from stromal cells, synovial fibroblasts, and T cells. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL, thereby inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and bone loss.  
FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IFN, interferon; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TGF, transforming growth factor.

2758 T	cell–directed	therapies	have	shown	clinical	efficacy	in	this	disease.	
Taken	together,	these	lines	of	evidence	suggest	that	CD4+	T	cells	play	
an	important	role	in	orchestrating	the	chronic	inflammatory	response	
in	RA.	However,	other	cell	types,	such	as	CD8+	T	cells,	natural	killer	
(NK)	cells,	and	B	cells	are	present	in	synovial	tissue	and	may	also	influ-
ence	pathogenic	responses.

In	 the	 rheumatoid	 joint,	 by	 mechanisms	 of	 cell-cell	 contact	 and	
release	 of	 soluble	 mediators,	 activated	 T	 cells	 stimulate	 macrophages	
and	 fibroblast-like	 synoviocytes	 to	 generate	 proinflammatory	 medi-
ators	 and	 proteases	 that	 drive	 the	 synovial	 inflammatory	 response	
and	destroy	the	cartilage	and	bone.	CD4+	T-cell	activation	is	depen-
dent	 on	 two	 signals:	 (1)	 T-cell	 receptor	 binding	 to	 peptide-MHC	
on	 antigen-presenting	 cells;	 and	 (2)	 CD28	 binding	 to	 CD80/86	 on	
antigen-presenting	 cells.	 This	 interaction	 then	 leads	 to	 downstream	
signals	 that	 differentiate	 CD4+	 T	 cells	 into	 effector	 and	 memory	
cell	 populations,	 as	 well	 as	 activate	 CD8+	 T	 cells.	 Certain	 subsets	 of	
CD4+	T	cells,	called	T	helper	cells,	enable	B	cells	to	differentiate	into	
antibody-secreting	cells.	An	earlier	T	cell–centric	model	for	the	patho-
genesis	of	RA	was	based	on	a	TH1-driven	paradigm,	which	came	from	
studies	 indicating	 that	 CD4+	 T	 helper	 (TH)	 cells	 differentiated	 into	
TH1	and	TH2	subsets,	each	with	their	distinctive	cytokine	profiles.	TH1	
cells	were	found	to	mainly	produce	interferon	γ	(IFN-γ),	lymphotoxin	
β,	 and	 TNF-α,	 whereas	 TH2	 cells	 predominately	 secreted	 IL-4,	 IL-5,	
IL-6,	 IL-10,	 and	 IL-13.	 In	 humans,	 naïve	 T	 cells	 may	 be	 induced	 to	
differentiate	into	TH17	cells	by	exposure	to	transforming	growth	factor	
β	(TGF-β),	IL-1,	IL-6,	and	IL-23.	Upon	activation,	TH17	cells	secrete	
a	 variety	 of	 proinflammatory	 mediators	 such	 as	 IL-17,	 IL-21,	 IL-22,	
TNF-α,	IL-26,	IL-6,	and	granulocyte-macrophage	colony-stimulating	
factor	(GM-CSF).	Substantial	evidence	now	exists	from	studies	in	both	
animal	 models	 and	 humans	 that	 IL-17	 plays	 an	 important	 role	 not	
only	in	promoting	joint	inflammation	but	also	in	destroying	cartilage	
and	subchondral	bone.	However,	in	a	phase	2	clinical	trial,	treatment	
with	secukinumab,	an	anti-IL-17	receptor	antibody,	failed	to	produce	
significant	clinical	benefit	in	patients	with	RA.

The	 immune	 system	 has	 evolved	 mechanisms	 to	 counterbalance	
the	potential	harmful	immune-mediated	inflammatory	responses	pro-
voked	 by	 infectious	 agents	 and	 other	 triggers.	 Among	 these	 negative	
regulators	 are	 regulatory	 T	 (Treg)	 cells,	 which	 are	 produced	 in	 the	
thymus	 and	 induced	 in	 the	 periphery	 to	 suppress	 immune-mediated	
inflammation.	 They	 are	 characterized	 by	 the	 surface	 expression	 of	
CD25	and	the	expression	of	the	transcription	factor	forkhead	box	P3	
(FOXP3)	and	the	absence	of	CD127,	the	IL-7	receptor.	Tregs	orches-
trate	dominant	tolerance	through	contact	with	other	immune	cells	and	
secretion	 of	 inhibitory	 cytokines,	 such	 as	 TGF-β,	 IL-10,	 and	 IL-35.	
They	 are	 heterogeneous	 and	 capable	 of	 suppressing	 distinct	 classes	
(TH1,	 TH2,	 TH17)	 of	 the	 immune	 response.	 In	 RA,	 the	 data	 that	Treg	
numbers	 and	 suppressive	 capacity	 are	 deficient	 compared	 with	 normal	
healthy	controls	are	contradictory	and	inconclusive.	Some	experimental	
evidence	suggests	that	Treg	suppressive	activity	is	lost	due	to	dysfunc-
tional	expression	of	cytotoxic	T	lymphocyte	antigen	4	(CTLA-4).	The	
nature	 of	 Treg	 defects	 in	 RA	 and	 their	 role	 in	 disease	 mechanisms	
remain	unclear.

Cytokines,	chemokines,	antibodies,	and	endogenous	danger	signals	
bind	to	receptors	on	the	surface	of	immune	cells	and	stimulate	a	cas-
cade	of	intracellular	signaling	events	that	can	amplify	the	inflammatory	
response.	Signaling	molecules	and	their	binding	partners	in	these	path-
ways	are	the	target	of	small-molecule	drugs	designed	to	interfere	with	
signal	transduction	and,	in	turn,	block	these	reinforcing	inflammatory	
loops.	Examples	of	signaling	molecules	in	these	critical	inflammatory	
pathways	 include	 Janus	 kinase	 (JAK)/signal	 transducers	 and	 activa-
tors	 of	 transcription	 (STAT),	 spleen	 tyrosine	 kinase	 (Syk),	 mitogen-	
activated	 protein	 kinases	 (MAPKs),	 and	 nuclear	 factor-κB	 (NF-κB).	
These	 pathways	 exhibit	 significant	 crosstalk	 and	 are	 found	 in	 many	
cell	types.	Some	signal	transducers,	such	as	the	JAKs,	are	expressed	in	
hematopoietic	 cells	 and	 play	 an	 important	 role	 in	 the	 inflammatory	
response	in	RA.

Activated,	 autoreactive	 B	 cells	 are	 also	 important	 players	 in	 the	
chronic	 inflammatory	 response.	 B	 cells	 give	 rise	 to	 plasma	 cells,	
which	in	turn,	produce	antibodies,	including	RF	and	ACPA.	RFs	may	

form	 large	 immune	 complexes	 inside	 the	 joint	 that	 contribute	 to	 the	
pathogenic	 process	 by	 fixing	 complement	 and	 promoting	 the	 release	
of	 proinflammatory	 cytokines	 and	 chemokines.	 In	 mouse	 models	 of	
arthritis,	 RF-containing	 immune	 complexes	 and	 ACPA-containing	
immune	complexes	synergize	with	other	mechanisms	to	exacerbate	the	
synovial	inflammatory	response.

RA	is	often	considered	to	be	a	macrophage-driven	disease	because	
this	cell	type	is	the	predominant	source	of	proinflammatory	cytokines	
inside	the	joint.	Key	proinflammatory	cytokines	released	by	synovial	
macrophages	include	TNF-α,	IL-1,	IL-6,	IL-12,	IL-15,	IL-18,	and	IL-23.	
Synovial	 fibroblasts,	 the	 other	 major	 cell	 type	 in	 this	 microenviron-
ment,	produce	the	cytokines	IL-1	and	IL-6	as	well	as	TNF-α.	TNF-α	
is	a	pivotal	cytokine	in	the	pathobiology	of	synovial	inflammation.	It	
upregulates	 adhesion	 molecules	 on	 endothelial	 cells,	 promoting	 the	
influx	 of	 leukocytes	 into	 the	 synovial	 microenvironment;	 activates	
synovial	 fibroblasts;	 stimulates	 angiogenesis;	 promotes	 pain	 receptor	
sensitizing	pathways;	and	drives	osteoclastogenesis.	Fibroblasts	secrete	
matrix	metalloproteinases	(MMPs)	as	well	as	other	proteases	that	are	
chiefly	responsible	for	the	breakdown	of	articular	cartilage;	they	also	
promote	inflammation	and	synovial	proliferation	by	secreting	cytok-
ines	such	as	IL-6,	IL-1,	IL-18,	and	GM-CSF,	chemokines,	and	vascular	
endothelial	growth	factor.

Osteoclast	activation	at	the	site	of	the	pannus	is	closely	tied	to	the	
presence	of	focal	bone	erosion.	Receptor	activator	of	nuclear	factor-κB	
ligand	(RANKL)	is	expressed	by	stromal	cells,	synovial	fibroblasts,	and	
T	cells.	Upon	binding	to	its	receptor	RANK	on	osteoclast	progenitors,	
RANKL	 stimulates	 osteoclast	 differentiation	 and	 bone	 resorption.	
RANKL	activity	is	regulated	by	osteoprotegerin	(OPG),	a	decoy	recep-
tor	of	RANKL	that	blocks	osteoclast	formation.	Monocytic	cells	in	the	
synovium	serve	as	the	precursors	of	osteoclasts	and,	when	exposed	to	
macrophage	colony-stimulating	factor	(M-CSF)	and	RANKL,	fuse	to	
form	polykaryons	termed	preosteoclasts.	These	precursor	cells	undergo	
further	 differentiation	 into	 osteoclasts	 with	 the	 characteristic	 ruffled	
membrane.	 Cytokines	 such	 as	 TNF-α,	 IL-1,	 IL-6,	 and	 IL-17	 increase	
the	expression	of	RANKL	in	the	joint	and	thus	promote	osteoclasto-
genesis.	Osteoclasts	also	secrete	cathepsin	K,	a	cysteine	protease	that	
degrades	the	bone	matrix	by	cleaving	collagen	and	contributes	to	gen-
eralized	bone	loss	and	osteoporosis.

Increased	 bone	 loss	 is	 only	 part	 of	 the	 story	 in	 RA,	 as	 decreased	
bone	 formation	 plays	 a	 crucial	 role	 in	 bone	 remodeling	 at	 sites	 of	
inflammation.	 Recent	 evidence	 shows	 that	 inflammation	 suppresses	
bone	formation.	TNF-α	plays	a	key	role	in	actively	suppressing	bone	
formation	 by	 enhancing	 the	 expression	 of	 dickkopf-1	 (DKK-1).		
DKK-1	 is	 an	 important	 inhibitor	 of	 the	 Wnt	 pathway,	 which	 acts	 to	
promote	 osteoblast	 differentiation	 and	 bone	 formation.	 The	 Wnt	
system	 is	 a	 family	 of	 soluble	 glycoproteins	 that	 binds	 to	 cell-surface	
receptors	 known	 as	 frizzled	 (fz)	 and	 low-density	 lipoprotein	 (LDL)	
receptor–related	proteins	(LRPs)	and	promotes	cell	growth.	In	animal	
models,	increased	levels	of	DKK-1	are	associated	with	decreased	bone	
formation,	 whereas	 inhibition	 of	 DKK-1	 protects	 against	 structural	
damage	in	the	joint.	Wnt	proteins	also	induce	the	formation	of	OPG	
and	thereby	shut	down	bone	resorption,	emphasizing	their	key	role	in	
tightly	regulating	the	balance	between	bone	resorption	and	formation.

DIAGNOSIS
The	clinical	diagnosis	of	RA	is	largely	based	on	signs	and	symptoms	
of	a	chronic	inflammatory	arthritis,	with	laboratory	and	radiographic	
results	 providing	 important	 corroborating	 information.	 In	 2010,	 a	
collaborative	 effort	 between	 the	 American	 College	 of	 Rheumatology	
(ACR)	 and	 the	 European	 League	 Against	 Rheumatism	 (EULAR)	
revised	 the	 1987	 ACR	 classification	 criteria	 for	 RA	 in	 an	 effort	 to	
improve	 early	 diagnosis	 with	 the	 goal	 of	 identifying	 patients	 who	
would	 benefit	 from	 early	 introduction	 of	 disease-modifying	 therapy	
(Table 358-1).	Application	of	the	newly	revised	criteria	yields	a	score	
of	0–10,	with	a	score	of	≥6	fulfilling	the	requirements	for	definite	RA.	
The	 new	 classification	 criteria	 differ	 in	 several	 ways	 from	 the	 older	
criteria	 set.	 Early	 clinical	 classifications	 for	 RA	 required	 symptoms	
to	 be	 present	 for	 >6	 weeks.	 There	 are	 several	 conditions,	 including	
virus-related	 syndromes,	 that	 can	 cause	 a	 polyarthritis	 mimicking

RA	 and	 stimulate	 the	 transient	 production	 of	 RF.	 Such	 conditions	
usually	last	only	2–3	weeks.	The	newer	criteria,	however,	do	not	man-
date	symptoms	be	present	for	>6	weeks.	The	new	criteria	also	include	
as	an	item	a	positive	test	for	serum	ACPA,	which	carries	greater	spec-
ificity	for	the	diagnosis	of	RA	than	a	positive	test	for	RF.	The	newer	
classification	criteria	also	do	not	take	into	account	whether	the	patient	
has	 rheumatoid	 nodules	 or	 radiographic	 joint	 damage	 because	 these	
findings	 occur	 rarely	 in	 early	 RA.	 It	 is	 important	 to	 emphasize	 that	
the	2010	ACR-EULAR	criteria	are	“classification	criteria”	as	opposed	
to	“diagnostic	criteria”	and	serve	to	distinguish	patients	at	the	onset	of	
disease	who	have	a	high	likelihood	of	evolution	to	chronic	disease	with	
persistent	 synovitis	 and	 joint	 damage.	 The	 presence	 of	 radiographic	
joint	 erosions	 or	 subcutaneous	 nodules	 may	 inform	 the	 diagnosis	 in	
the	later	stages	of	the	disease.	About	three-fourths	of	patients	with	the	
clinical	 and	 radiographic	 features	 of	 RA	 test	 positive	 for	 RF	 and/or	
ACPA	(seropositive),	while	the	remaining	one-fourth	of	patients	with	
RA	test	negative	for	RF	and/or	ACPA	(seronegative).

The	 differential	 diagnosis	 for	 RA	 includes	 all	 types	 of	 acute	 and	
chronic	inflammatory	arthritides,	many	of	which	may	be	differentiated	
from	RA	based	on	the	clinical	course,	pattern	of	joint	involvement,	and	
the	presence	of	disease	in	other	organ	systems.	Patients	with	primary	
Sjögren’s	syndrome	whose	predominate	clinical	manifestations	are	dry	
eyes	and	dry	mouth	often	also	have	symptoms	of	polyarthralgia	and	
may	 show	 a	 mild	 inflammatory	 synovitis	 similar	 to	 RA.	 Moreover,	
50%	of	patients	with	primary	Sjögren’s	syndrome	test	positive	for	RF	
and	therefore,	may	be	confused	with	early	RA.	Spondyloarthropathies	
such	 as	 psoriatic	 arthritis	 or	 enteropathy-associated	 arthritis	 may	
present	 similarly	 to	 RA.	 However,	 they	 may	 be	 distinguished	 by	 the	
presence	of	sacroiliitis	and	other	enthesopathic	features	and	are	gener-
ally	accompanied	by	signs	of	psoriasis	or	inflammatory	bowel	disease,	
respectively.	 In	 elderly	 patients,	 seronegative	 RA	 may	 be	 difficult	 at	
times	to	distinguish	from	polymyalgia	rheumatica	(PMR).	While	PMR	
has	 been	 associated	 in	 a	 minority	 with	 distal	 limb	 involvement,	 RA	
may	be	distinguished	by	predominant	involvement	of	the	wrists/hands	
and	 ankles/feet	 in	 most	 cases.	 Similarly,	 the	 relatively	 rare	 condition	
called	remitting	seronegative	symmetrical	synovitis	with	pitting	edema	
(the	 so-called	 RS3PE	 syndrome)	 and	 paraneoplastic	 syndromes	 may	
also	 be	 confused	 with	 early	 RA.	 RS3PE	 is	 typically	 characterized	 by	
prominent	distal	limb	pitting	edema,	which	is	unusual	in	RA,	and	par-
ticular	responsive	to	treatment	with	low	doses	of	prednisone.	Chronic	
tophaceous	gout	may	mimic	severe	RA	in	some	cases,	and	tophi	may	

be	confused	with	rheumatoid	nodules.	Hepatitis	C–related	arthropathy	
often	 involves	 the	 small	 joints	 of	 the	 hands	 and	 is	 associated	 with	 a	
positive	RF	in	about	half	the	cases,	but	generally	not	ACPA.

LABORATORY FEATURES
Patients	 with	 systemic	 inflammatory	 diseases	 such	 as	 RA	 will	 often	
present	 with	 elevated	 nonspecific	 inflammatory	 markers	 such	 as	 an	
ESR	or	CRP.	Detection	of	serum	RF	and	anti-CCP	antibodies	is	impor-
tant	in	differentiating	RA	from	other	polyarticular	diseases,	although	
RF	lacks	diagnostic	specificity	and	may	be	found	in	association	with	
other	chronic	inflammatory	diseases	in	which	arthritis	figures	in	the	
clinical	manifestations.

IgM,	IgG,	and	IgA	isotypes	of	RF	occur	in	sera	from	patients	with	
RA,	 although	 the	 IgM	 isotype	 is	 the	 one	 most	 frequently	 measured	
by	 commercial	 laboratories.	 Serum	 IgM	 RF	 has	 been	 found	 in	 75%	
of	patients	with	RA;	therefore,	a	negative	result	does	not	exclude	the	
presence	of	this	disease.	It	is	also	found	in	other	connective	tissue	dis-
eases,	such	as	primary	Sjögren’s	syndrome,	systemic	lupus	erythema-
tosus,	and	type	II	mixed	essential	cryoglobulinemia,	as	well	as	chronic	
infections	such	as	subacute	bacterial	endocarditis	and	hepatitis	B	and	
C.	Serum	RF	may	also	be	detected	in	1–5%	of	the	healthy	population.
The	 presence	 of	 serum	 anti-CCP	 antibodies	 has	 about	 the	 same	
sensitivity	as	serum	RF	for	the	diagnosis	of	RA.	However,	its	diagnostic	
specificity	approaches	95%,	so	a	positive	test	for	anti-CCP	antibodies	in	
the	setting	of	an	early	inflammatory	arthritis	is	useful	for	distinguish-
ing	RA	from	other	forms	of	arthritis.	There	is	some	incremental	value	
in	testing	for	the	presence	of	both	RF	and	anti-CCP,	as	some	patients	
with	RA	are	positive	for	RF	but	negative	for	anti-CCP	and	vice	versa.	
The	presence	of	RF	or	anti-CCP	antibodies	also	has	prognostic	signifi-
cance,	with	anti-CCP	antibodies	showing	the	most	value	for	predicting	
worse	outcomes.

Patients	 with	 RA	 may	 also	 have	 other	 antibodies	 associated	 with	
autoimmune	 disease.	 Approximately	 30%	 of	 patients	 with	 RA	 test	
positive	for	antinuclear	antibodies	(ANAs),	and	some	sera	from	some	
patients	contain	antineutrophil	cytoplasmic	antibodies	(ANCAs;	par-
ticularly	p-ANCAs).	However,	patients	with	RA	would	not	be	expected	
to	test	positive	for	anti-MPO	or	anti-PR3	antibodies.
 ■ SYNOVIAL FLUID ANALYSIS
Typically,	the	cellular	composition	of	synovial	fluid	from	patients	with	RA	
reflects	an	acute	inflammatory	state.	Synovial	fluid	white	blood	cell	(WBC)	
counts	can	vary	widely	but	generally	range	between	5000	and	50,000	WBC/
μL,	compared	with	<2000	WBC/μL	for	a	noninflammatory	condition	such	
as	 osteoarthritis.	 In	 contrast	 to	 the	 synovial	 tissue,	 the	 overwhelming	
cell	type	in	the	synovial	fluid	is	the	neutrophil.	Clinically,	the	analysis	of	
synovial	fluid	is	most	useful	for	confirming	an	inflammatory	arthritis	(as	
opposed	to	osteoarthritis),	while	at	the	same	time	excluding	infection	or	a	
crystal-induced	arthritis	such	as	gout	or	pseudogout	(Chap. 372).
 ■ JOINT IMAGING
Joint	 imaging	 is	 a	 valuable	 tool	 not	 only	 for	 diagnosing	 RA	 but	 also	
for	tracking	progression	of	any	joint	damage.	Plain	x-ray	is	the	most	
common	 imaging	 modality,	 but	 it	 is	 limited	 to	 visualization	 of	 the	
bony	structures	and	inferences	about	the	state	of	the	articular	cartilage	
based	 on	 the	 amount	 of	 joint	 space	 narrowing.	 MRI	 and	 ultrasound	
techniques	offer	the	added	value	of	detecting	changes	in	the	soft	tissues	
such	 as	 synovitis,	 tenosynovitis,	 and	 effusions,	 as	 well	 as	 providing	
greater	 sensitivity	 for	 identifying	 bony	 abnormalities.	 Plain	 radio-
graphs	 are	 usually	 relied	 upon	 in	 clinical	 practice	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	
diagnosis	and	monitoring	of	affected	joints.	However,	in	selected	cases,	
MRI	 and	 ultrasound	 can	 provide	 additional	 diagnostic	 information	
that	 may	 guide	 clinical	 decision	 making.	 Musculoskeletal	 ultrasound	
with	power	Doppler	is	increasingly	used	in	rheumatology	clinical	prac-
tice	for	detecting	synovitis	and	bone	erosion.
Plain  Radiography  Classically	 in	 RA,	 the	 initial	 radiographic	
finding	 is	 periarticular	 osteopenia.	 Practically	 speaking,	 however,	
this	finding	is	difficult	to	appreciate	on	plain	films	and	on	the	newer	
digitalized	 x-rays.	 Other	 findings	 on	 plain	 radiographs	 include	 soft	
tissue	swelling,	symmetric	joint	space	loss,	and	subchondral	erosions,

which make for a truly heterogeneous disease. There is no simple way 
to  predict  the  clinical  course.  It  is  important  to  realize  that  as  many 
as 10% of patients with inflammatory arthritis fulfilling ACR classifi-
cation criteria for RA will undergo a spontaneous remission within 6 
months (particularly seronegative patients). However, the vast majority 
of patients will exhibit a pattern of persistent and progressive disease 
activity  that  waxes  and  wanes  in  intensity  over  time.  A  minority  of 
patients  will  show  intermittent  and  recurrent  explosive  attacks  of 
inflammatory arthritis interspersed with periods of disease quiescence. 
Finally, an aggressive form of RA may occur in an unfortunate few with 
inexorable  progression  of  severe  erosive  joint  disease,  although  this 
highly destructive course is less common in the modern treatment era.
Disability,  as  measured  by  the  Health  Assessment  Questionnaire 
(HAQ), shows gradual worsening of disability over time in the face of 
poorly  controlled  disease  activity  and  disease  progression.  Disability 
may  result  from  both  a  disease  activity–related  component  that  is 
potentially reversible with therapy and a joint damage–related compo-
nent owing to the cumulative and largely irreversible effects of soft tis-
sue, cartilage, and bone breakdown. Early in the course of disease, the 
extent of joint inflammation is the primary determinant of disability, 
while in the later stages of disease, the amount of joint damage is the 
dominant contributing factor. Previous studies have shown that more 
than one-half of patients with RA are unable to work 10 years after the 
onset of their disease; however, increased employability and less work 
absenteeism have been reported recently with the use of newer thera-
pies and earlier treatment intervention.

The overall mortality rate in RA is two times greater than the general 
population, with ischemic heart disease being the most common cause 
of death followed by infection. Median life expectancy is shortened by 
an average of 7 years for men and 3 years for women compared with 
control populations. Patients at higher risk for shortened survival are 
those with systemic extraarticular involvement, low functional capacity, 
low socioeconomic status, low education, and chronic prednisone use.

TREATMENT
Rheumatoid Arthritis

The amount of clinical disease activity in patients with RA reflects 
the  overall  burden  of  inflammation  and  is  the  variable  that  most 
influences  treatment  decisions.  Joint  inflammation  is  the  main 
driver of joint damage and is the most important cause of functional 
disability  in  the  early  stages  of  disease.  Several  composite  indices 
have  been  developed  to  assess  clinical  disease  activity.  The  ACR 
20,  50,  and  70  improvement  criteria  (which  correspond  to  a  20, 
50, and 70% improvement, respectively, in joint counts, physician/

most frequently in the wrists and hands (MCPs and PIPs) and the feet 
(MTPs). In the feet, the lateral aspect of the fifth MTP is often targeted 
first,  but  other  MTP  joints  may  be  involved  at  the  same  time.  X-ray 
imaging of advanced RA may reveal signs of severe destruction, includ-
ing joint subluxation and collapse (Fig. 358-5).

MRI  MRI  offers  the  greatest  sensitivity  for  detecting  synovitis  and 
joint effusions, as well as early bone and bone marrow changes. These 
soft tissue abnormalities often occur before osseous changes are noted on 
x-ray. Presence of bone marrow edema has been recognized to be an early 
sign of inflammatory joint disease and can predict the subsequent devel-
opment of erosions on plain radiographs as well as MRI scans. Cost and 
availability of MRI are the main factors limiting its routine clinical use.
Ultrasound  Ultrasound, including power color Doppler, can detect 
more  erosions  than  plain  radiography,  especially  in  easily  accessible 
joints.  It  can  also  reliably  detect  synovitis,  including  increased  joint 
vascularity indicative of inflammation. The usefulness of ultrasound is 
dependent on the experience of the sonographer; however, it does offer 
the advantages of portability, lack of radiation, and low expense relative 
to MRI, factors that make it attractive as a clinical tool (Fig. 358-6).
CLINICAL COURSE
The natural history of RA is complex and affected by a number of fac-
tors including age of onset, gender, genotype, phenotype (i.e., extraar-
ticular  manifestations  or  variants  of  RA),  and  comorbid  conditions,

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disorderspatient	 assessment	 of	 disease	 severity,	 pain	 scale,	 serum	 levels	 of	
acute-phase	 reactants	 [ESR	 or	 CRP],	 and	 a	 functional	 assessment	
of	disability	using	a	self-administered	patient	questionnaire)	are	a	
composite	index	with	a	dichotomous	response	variable.	The	ACR	
improvement	 criteria	 are	 commonly	 used	 in	 clinical	 trials	 as	 an	
endpoint	 for	 comparing	 the	 proportion	 of	 responders	 between	
treatment	 groups.	 In	 contrast,	 the	 Disease	 Activity	 Score	 (DAS),	
Simplified	 Disease	 Activity	 Index	 (SDAI),	 the	 Clinical	 Disease	
Activity	 Index	 (CDAI),	 and	 the	 Routine	 Assessment	 of	 Patient	
Index	Data	3	(RAPID3)	are	continuous	measures	of	disease	activity	
that	are	used	in	clinical	practice	for	tracking	disease	status	and	doc-
umenting	treatment	response.

Several	developments	during	the	past	two	decades	have	changed	
the	 therapeutic	 landscape	 in	 RA.	 They	 include	 (1)	 the	 emer-
gence	 of	 methotrexate	 as	 the	 disease-modifying	 antirheumatic	
drug	 (DMARD)	 of	 first	 choice	 for	 the	 treatment	 of	 early	 RA;	 (2)	
the	 development	 of	 novel	 highly	 efficacious	 biologicals	 that	 can	
be	 used	 alone	 or	 in	 combination	 with	 methotrexate;	 and	 (3)	 the	
proven	superiority	of	combination	DMARD	regimens	over	metho-
trexate	alone.	The	medications	used	for	the	treatment	of	RA	may	
be	 divided	 into	 broad	 categories:	 nonsteroidal	 anti-inflammatory	
drugs	 (NSAIDs);	 glucocorticoids,	 such	 as	 prednisone	 and	 meth-
ylprednisolone;	 conventional	 DMARDs;	 and	 biologic	 DMARDs	
(Table  358-2).	 Although	 disease	 for	 some	 patients	 with	 RA	 is	
managed	adequately	with	a	single	DMARD,	such	as	methotrexate,	
it	demands	in	most	cases	the	use	of	a	combination	DMARD	reg-
imen	 that	 may	 vary	 in	 its	 components	 over	 the	 treatment	 course	
depending	 on	 fluctuations	 in	 disease	 activity	 and	 emergence	 of	
drug-related	toxicities	and	comorbidities.	

NSAIDS
NSAIDs	were	formerly	viewed	as	the	core	of	RA	therapy,	but	they	
are	 now	 considered	 to	 be	 adjunctive	 agents	 for	 management	 of	
symptoms	 uncontrolled	 by	 other	 measures.	 NSAIDs	 exhibit	 both	
analgesic	and	anti-inflammatory	properties.	The	anti-inflammatory	
effects	of	NSAIDs	derive	from	their	ability	to	nonselectively	inhibit	
cyclooxygenase	(COX)-1	and	COX-2.	Although	the	results	of	clin-
ical	trials	suggest	that	NSAIDs	are	roughly	equivalent	in	their	effi-
cacy,	experience	suggests	that	some	individuals	may	preferentially	
respond	to	a	particular	NSAID.	Chronic	use	should	be	minimized	
due	to	the	possibility	of	side	effects,	including	gastritis	and	peptic	
ulcer	disease	as	well	as	impairment	of	renal	function.	

GLUCOCORTICOIDS
Glucocorticoids	may	serve	in	several	ways	to	control	disease	activity	
in	 RA.	 First,	 they	 may	 be	 administered	 in	 low	 to	 moderate	 doses	
to	 achieve	 rapid	 disease	 control	 before	 the	 onset	 of	 fully	 effective	
DMARD	therapy,	which	often	takes	several	weeks	or	even	months.	
Second,	a	1-	to	2-week	burst	of	glucocorticoids	may	be	prescribed	
for	the	management	of	acute	disease	flares,	with	dose	and	duration	
guided	by	the	severity	of	the	exacerbation.	Chronic	administration	
of	low	doses	(5–10	mg/d)	of	prednisone	(or	its	equivalent)	may	also	
be	warranted	to	control	disease	activity	in	patients	with	an	inade-
quate	response	to	DMARD	therapy.	As	much	as	possible,	chronic	
glucocorticoid	 therapy	 should	 be	 avoided	 in	 favor	 of	 finding	 an	
effective	 DMARD	 that	 adequately	 controls	 the	 disease.	 Best	 prac-
tices	minimize	chronic	use	of	low-dose	prednisone	therapy	owing	
to	the	risk	of	osteoporosis	and	other	long-term	complications;	how-
ever,	the	use	of	chronic	prednisone	therapy	is	unavoidable	in	some	
cases.	High-dose	glucocorticoids	may	be	necessary	for	the	treatment	
of	severe	extraarticular	manifestations	of	RA,	such	as	ILD.	Finally,	
if	a	patient	exhibits	one	or	a	few	actively	inflamed	joints,	the	clini-
cian	may	consider	intraarticular	injection	of	an	intermediate-acting	
glucocorticoid	 such	 as	 triamcinolone	 acetonide.	 This	 approach	
may	allow	for	rapid	control	of	inflammation	in	a	limited	number	of	
affected	joints.	Caution	must	be	exercised	to	appropriately	exclude	
joint	infection	as	it	often	mimics	an	RA	flare.

Osteoporosis	 ranks	 as	 an	 important	 long-term	 complication	 of	
chronic	prednisone	use.	Based	on	a	patient’s	risk	factors,	including

total	prednisone	dosage,	length	of	treatment,	gender,	race,	and	bone	
density,	 treatment	 with	 a	 bisphosphonate	 may	 be	 appropriate	 for	
primary	prevention	of	glucocorticoid-induced	osteoporosis.	Other	
agents,	including	teriparatide	and	denosumab,	have	been	approved	
for	the	treatment	of	osteoporosis	and	may	be	indicated	in	certain	
cases.	 Although	 prednisone	 use	 is	 known	 to	 increase	 the	 risk	 of	
peptic	 ulcer	 disease,	 especially	 with	 concomitant	 NSAID	 use,	 no	
evidence-based	 guidelines	 have	 been	 published	 regarding	 the	 use	
of	gastrointestinal	ulcer	prophylaxis	in	this	situation.	
DMARDS
DMARDs	are	so	named	because	of	their	ability	to	slow	or	prevent	
structural	progression	of	RA.	The	conventional	DMARDs	include	
hydroxychloroquine,	sulfasalazine,	methotrexate,	and	leflunomide;	
they	exhibit	a	delayed	onset	of	action	of	~6–12	weeks.	Methotrexate	
is	the	DMARD	of	choice	for	the	treatment	of	RA	and	is	the	anchor	
drug	for	most	combination	therapies.	It	was	approved	for	the	treat-
ment	 of	 RA	 in	 1988	 and	 remains	 the	 benchmark	 for	 the	 efficacy	
and	safety	of	new	disease-modifying	therapies.	At	the	dosages	used	
for	 the	 treatment	 of	 RA,	 methotrexate	 has	 been	 shown	 to	 stimu-
late	adenosine	release	from	cells,	producing	an	anti-inflammatory	
effect.	Methotrexate	is	administered	weekly	by	the	oral	or	subcuta-
neous	route.	Folic	acid	is	taken	as	co-therapy	to	mitigate	some	of	
methotrexate’s	side	effects.	The	clinical	efficacy	of	leflunomide,	an	
inhibitor	of	pyrimidine	synthesis,	appears	similar	to	that	of	metho-
trexate;	 it	 has	 been	 shown	 in	 well-designed	 trials	 to	 be	 effective	
for	 the	 treatment	 of	 RA	 as	 monotherapy	 or	 in	 combination	 with	
methotrexate	and	other	DMARDs.

Although	 similar	 to	 the	 other	 DMARDs	 in	 its	 slow	 onset	 of	
action,	 hydroxychloroquine	 has	 not	 been	 shown	 to	 delay	 radio-
graphic	 progression	 of	 disease	 and	 thus	 is	 not	 considered	 to	 be	 a	
true	DMARD.	In	clinical	practice,	hydroxychloroquine	is	generally	
used	for	treatment	of	early,	mild	disease	or	as	adjunctive	therapy	in	
combination	with	other	DMARDs.	It	is	a	prescribed	at	a	dosage	of		
5	mg/kg	of	body	weight	or	less	to	decrease	the	risk	of	retinal	toxicity.	
Sulfasalazine	 is	 used	 in	 a	 similar	 manner	 and	 has	 been	 shown	 in	
randomized,	 controlled	 trials	 to	 reduce	 radiographic	 progression	
of	disease.	Minocycline,	gold	salts,	penicillamine,	azathioprine,	and	
cyclosporine	have	all	been	used	for	the	treatment	of	RA	with	vary-
ing	 degrees	 of	 success;	 however,	 they	 are	 used	 sparingly	 now	 due	
to	their	inconsistent	clinical	efficacy	or	unfavorable	toxicity	profile.	

BIOLOGICALS
Biologic	DMARDs	have	revolutionized	the	treatment	of	RA	over	the	
past	decade	(Table	358-2).	They	are	protein	therapeutics	designed	
mostly	 to	 target	 cytokines	 and	 cell-surface	 molecules.	 The	 TNF	
inhibitors	 were	 the	 first	 biologicals	 approved	 for	 the	 treatment	 of	
RA.	 Anakinra,	 an	 IL-1	 receptor	 antagonist,	 was	 approved	 shortly	
thereafter;	however,	its	benefits	have	proved	to	be	relatively	modest	
compared	with	the	other	biologicals,	and	therefore,	this	biological	
is	rarely	used	for	the	treatment	of	RA	with	the	availability	of	other	
more	effective	agents.	Abatacept,	rituximab,	and	tocilizumab	are	the	
newest	members	of	this	class.	
Anti-TNF Agents  The	development	of	TNF	inhibitors	was	origi-
nally	spurred	by	the	experimental	finding	that	TNF-α	is	a	critical	
upstream	 mediator	 of	 joint	 inflammation.	 Currently,	 five	 agents	
that	 inhibit	 TNF-α	 are	 approved	 for	 the	 treatment	 of	 RA.	 There	
are	 three	 different	 anti-TNF	 monoclonal	 antibodies.	 Infliximab	
is	 a	 chimeric	 (part	 mouse	 and	 human)	 monoclonal	 antibody,	
whereas	adalimumab	and	golimumab	are	humanized	monoclonal	
antibodies.	 Certolizumab	 pegol	 is	 a	 pegylated	 Fab′	 fragment	 of	 a	
humanized	monoclonal	antibody	to	TNF-α.	Lastly,	etanercept	is	a	
soluble	fusion	protein	comprising	the	TNF	receptor	2	in	covalent	
linkage	with	the	Fc	portion	of	IgG1.	All	of	the	TNF	inhibitors	have	
been	shown	in	randomized	controlled	clinical	trials	to	reduce	the	
signs	and	symptoms	of	RA,	slow	radiographic	progression	of	joint	
damage,	 and	 improve	 physical	 function	 and	 quality	 of	 life.	 Anti-
TNF	 drugs	 are	 typically	 used	 in	 combination	 with	 background	
methotrexate	 therapy.	 This	 combination	 regimen,	 which	 affords

maximal	benefit	in	many	cases,	is	often	the	next	step	for	treatment	
of	 patients	 with	 an	 inadequate	 response	 to	 methotrexate	 therapy.	
Etanercept,	adalimumab,	certolizumab	pegol,	and	golimumab	have	
also	been	approved	for	use	as	monotherapy.

Anti-TNF	agents	should	be	avoided	in	patients	with	active	infec-
tion	or	a	history	of	hypersensitivity	to	these	agents	and	are	contrain-
dicated	in	patients	with	chronic	hepatitis	B	infection	or	class	III/IV	
congestive	heart	failure.	The	major	concern	is	the	increased	risk	for	
infection,	including	serious	bacterial	infections,	opportunistic	fun-
gal	infection,	and	reactivation	of	latent	tuberculosis.	For	this	reason,	
all	patients	are	screened	for	latent	tuberculosis	according	to	national	
guidelines	 prior	 to	 starting	 anti-TNF	 therapy	 (Chap.  178).	 In	 the	
United	States,	patients	have	historically	been	skin	tested	for	tuber-
culosis	using	an	intradermal	injection	of	purified	protein	derivative	
(PPD);	individuals	with	skin	reactions	of	>5	mm	are	presumed	to	
have	 had	 previous	 exposure	 to	 tuberculosis	 and	 are	 evaluated	 for	
active	disease	and	treated	accordingly.	Use	of	an	IFN-γ	release	assay	
may	also	be	appropriate	for	screening	as	some	data	suggest	a	lower	
rate	of	false-negative	and	false-positive	tests	with	an	IFN-γ	release	
assay	compared	with	skin	testing	with	PPD	in	patients	treated	with	
corticosteroids.	 While	 a	 combination	 of	 PPD	 skin	 test	 and	 IFN-γ	
release	 assay	 may	 offer	 the	 highest	 sensitivity	 for	 screening	 pur-
poses,	no	consensus	guidelines	exist.	
Anakinra  Anakinra	 is	 the	 recombinant	 form	 of	 the	 naturally	
occurring	 IL-1	 receptor	 antagonist.	 Although	 anakinra	 has	 seen	
limited	use	for	the	treatment	of	RA,	it	has	enjoyed	a	resurgence	of	
late	as	an	effective	therapy	of	systemic	juvenile-onset	inflammatory	
arthritis	and	adult	Still’s	disease	and	some	rare	inherited	syndromes	
dependent	on	IL-1	production,	including	neonatal-onset	inflamma-
tory	 disease,	 Muckle-Wells	 syndrome,	 familial	 cold	 urticaria,	 and	
macrophage	activation	syndrome.	
Abatacept  Abatacept	is	a	soluble	fusion	protein	consisting	of	the	
extracellular	 domain	 of	 human	 CTLA-4	 linked	 to	 the	 modified	
portion	of	human	IgG.	It	inhibits	the	co-stimulation	of	T	cells	by	
blocking	 CD28-CD80/86	 interactions	 and	 may	 also	 inhibit	 the	
function	 of	 antigen-presenting	 cells	 by	 reverse	 signaling	 through	
CD80	 and	 CD86.	 Abatacept	 has	 been	 shown	 in	 clinical	 trials	 to	
reduce	 disease	 activity,	 slow	 radiographic	 progression	 of	 damage,	
and	improve	functional	disability.	Many	patients	receive	abatacept	
in	 combination	 with	 a	 conventional	 DMARD.	 Abatacept	 therapy	
has	been	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	infection.	
Rituximab  Rituximab	is	a	chimeric	monoclonal	antibody	directed	
against	CD20,	a	cell-surface	molecule	expressed	by	most	mature	B	
lymphocytes.	It	works	by	depleting	B	cells,	which	in	turn,	leads	to	a	
reduction	in	the	inflammatory	response	by	unknown	mechanisms.	
These	mechanisms	may	include	a	reduction	in	autoantibodies,	inhi-
bition	 of	 T-cell	 activation,	 and	 alteration	 of	 cytokine	 production.	
Rituximab	 has	 been	 approved	 for	 the	 treatment	 of	 refractory	 RA	
(failure	of	treatment	with	a	TNF-α	inhibitor)	in	combination	with	

methotrexate	and	has	been	shown	to	be	more	effective	for	patients	
with	seropositive	than	seronegative	disease.	Rituximab	therapy	has	
been	associated	with	mild	to	moderate	infusion	reactions	as	well	as	
an	increased	risk	of	infection.	Notably,	there	have	been	rare	isolated	
reports	of	a	potentially	lethal	brain	disorder,	progressive	multifocal	
leukoencephalopathy	(PML),	in	association	with	rituximab	therapy,	
although	the	absolute	risk	of	this	complication	appears	to	be	very	
low	 in	 patients	 with	 RA.	 Most	 of	 these	 cases	 have	 occurred	 on	 a	
background	of	previous	or	current	exposure	to	other	potent	immu-
nosuppressive	drugs.	
Anti-IL-6  Agents 
IL-6	 is	 a	 proinflammatory	 cytokine	 implicated	
in	the	pathogenesis	of	RA,	with	effects	on	both	joint	inflammation	
and	 damage.	 IL-6	 binding	 to	 its	 receptor	 activates	 intracellular	
signaling	 pathways	 that	 affect	 the	 acute-phase	 response,	 cytokine	
production,	 and	 osteoclast	 activation.	 Tocilizumab	 and	 sarilumab	
are	 both	 monoclonal	 antibodies	 directed	 against	 the	 membrane	
and	soluble	forms	of	the	IL-6	receptor.	Clinical	trials	attest	to	the	
clinical	efficacy	of	these	therapies	for	RA,	both	as	monotherapy	and	
in	combination	with	methotrexate	and	other	DMARDs.	Anti-IL-6	
receptor	 agents	 have	 been	 associated	 with	 an	 increased	 risk	 of	
infection,	 neutropenia,	 and	 thrombocytopenia;	 the	 hematologic	
abnormalities	 appear	 to	 be	 reversible	 upon	 stopping	 the	 drug.	 In	
addition,	 this	 agent	 has	 been	 shown	 to	 increase	 LDL	 cholesterol.	
However,	it	is	not	known	if	this	effect	on	lipid	levels	increases	the	
risk	for	development	of	atherosclerotic	disease.	
TARGETED SYNTHETIC DMARDs
Because	some	patients	do	not	adequately	respond	to	conventional	
DMARDs	or	biologic	therapy,	other	therapeutic	targets	have	been	
investigated	 to	 fill	 this	 gap.	 Recently,	 drug	 development	 in	 RA	
has	 focused	 attention	 on	 the	 intracellular	 signaling	 pathways	 that	
transduce	the	positive	signals	of	cytokines	and	other	inflammatory	
mediators	 binding	 to	 their	 cell-surface	 receptors	 that	 create	 the	
positive	 feedback	 loops	 in	 the	 immune	 response.	 These	 targeted	
synthetic	DMARDs	aim	to	provide	the	same	efficacy	as	biological	
therapies	in	an	oral	formulation.	
JAK  Inhibitors  Although	 several	 different	 kinases	 have	 been	
evaluated	as	potential	treatment	targets	in	RA,	only	JAK	inhibitors	
have	demonstrated	safety	and	efficacy	for	the	treatment	of	RA;	they	
are	classified	as	targeted	synthetic	(ts)	DMARDS.	The	JAK	family	
comprises	four	members	(JAK1,	JAK2,	JAK3,	and	tyrosine	kinase	2	
[Tyk2])	that	link	extracellular	cytokine	receptors	with	intracellular	
signaling	domains.	They	mediate	signaling	of	the	receptors	for	the	
common	γ-chain-related	cytokines	IL-2,	-4,	-7,	-9,	-15,	and	-21,	as	
well	as	IFN-γ	and	IL-6.	These	cytokines	all	play	roles	in	promoting	
T-	and	B-cell	activation	as	well	as	inflammation.

Tofacitinib	 is	 a	 selective	 JAK1	 and	 JAK3	 inhibitor	 with	 minor	
inhibitory	effects	on	JAK2	and	Tyk2,	whereas	baricitinib	is	a	selec-
tive	 JAK1	 and	 JAK2	 inhibitor	 with	 moderate	 inhibition	 of	 Tyk2	
and	minimal	inhibition	of	JAK3.	Upadacitinib	is	a	predominately

selective	inhibitor	of	JAK1.	It	has	been	hypothesized	that	preferen-
tial	inhibition	of	JAK1	might	reduce	dose-related	toxicity,	without	
a	 significant	 detriment	 of	 its	 efficacy.	 JAK	 inhibitors	 can	 be	 used	
as	 monotherapy	 or	 in	 combination	 with	 methotrexate.	 Possible	
side	 effects	 of	 these	 agents	 include	 elevated	 serum	 transaminases	
indicative	of	liver	injury,	neutropenia,	increased	cholesterol	levels,	
and	 elevation	 in	 serum	 creatinine.	 Recent	 studies	 have	 found	 an	
increased	risk	of	thrombosis,	major	adverse	cardiovascular	events	
and	malignancies	in	patients	taking	tofacitinib	compared	with	TNF	
inhibitors.	Its	use	is	also	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	infec-
tions,	including	bacterial	infections	and	herpes	zoster.	
TREATMENT OF EXTRAARTICULAR MANIFESTATIONS
In	 general,	 treatment	 of	 the	 underlying	 RA	 favorably	 modifies	
extraarticular	 manifestations,	 and	 it	 appears	 that	 aggressive	 man-
agement	of	early	disease	can	potentially	prevent	their	occurrence	in	
the	first	place.	RA-ILD,	however,	can	be	particularly	challenging	to	
treat	because	some	of	the	DMARDs	used	for	the	treatment	of	RA	
are	 associated	 with	 pulmonary	 toxicity,	 such	 as	 methotrexate	 and	
leflunomide.	 High	 doses	 of	 corticosteroids	 and	 adjunctive	 immu-
nosuppressive	agents,	such	as	azathioprine,	mycophenolate	mofetil,	
and	rituximab	have	been	used	for	treatment	of	RA-ILD.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Rheumatoid Arthritis

The	treatment	of	RA	adheres	to	the	following	principles	and	goals:	
(1)	early,	aggressive	therapy	to	prevent	joint	damage	and	disability;	
(2)	frequent	modification	of	DMARD	therapy	to	achieve	treatment	
goals	with	utilization	of	combination	therapy	where	appropriate;	(3)	
individualization	 of	 DMARD	 therapy	 in	 an	 attempt	 to	 maximize	
response	and	minimize	side	effects;	(4)	minimal	use	of	long-term	
glucocorticoid	therapy;	and	(5)	achieving,	whenever	possible,	low	
disease	 activity	 or	 clinical	 remission.	 A	 considerable	 amount	 of	
evidence	supports	this	intensive	treatment	approach.

As	 mentioned	 earlier,	 methotrexate	 is	 the	 DMARD	 of	 first	
choice	 for	 initial	 treatment	 of	 moderate	 to	 severe	 RA.	 Failure	 to	
achieve	adequate	improvement	with	methotrexate	therapy	calls	for	
a	 change	 in	 DMARD	 therapy,	 usually	 a	 transition	 to	 an	 effective	
combination	 regimen.	 Effective	 combinations	 include	 methotrex-
ate,	 sulfasalazine,	 and	 hydroxychloroquine	 (oral	 triple	 therapy);	
methotrexate	and	leflunomide;	and	methotrexate	plus	a	biological.	
The	combination	of	methotrexate	and	an	anti-TNF	agent,	for	exam-
ple,	has	been	shown	in	randomized	controlled	trials	to	be	superior	
to	methotrexate	alone,	not	only	for	reducing	signs	and	symptoms	
of	disease	but	also	for	retarding	the	progression	of	structural	joint	
damage.	Predicting	which	patients	are	at	higher	risk	for	developing	
radiologic	joint	damage	is	imprecise	at	best,	although	some	factors	
such	as	an	elevated	serum	level	of	acute-phase	reactants,	high	bur-
den	of	joint	inflammation,	and	the	presence	of	erosive	disease	are	
associated	with	increased	likelihood	of	developing	structural	injury.
In	2015,	the	ACR	updated	and	published	their	guidelines	for	the	
treatment	 of	 RA.	 They	 do	 make	 a	 distinction	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	
patients	with	early	(<6	months	of	disease	duration)	and	established	
disease	and	highlight	the	use	of	a	treat-to-target	approach	and	the	
need	to	switch	or	add	therapies	for	worsening	or	persistent	mod-
erate/high	disease	activity.	For	example,	in	patients	with	early	RA	
who	 have	 persistent	 moderate/high	 disease	 activity	 on	 DMARD	
monotherapy,	providers	should	consider	escalation	to	combination	
DMARD	therapy	or	switching	to	an	anti-TNF	+/–	methotrexate	or	
a	non-TNF	biologic	+/–	methotrexate.	Since	a	more	intensive	initial	
approach	 (e.g.,	 combination	 DMARD	 therapy)	 has	 been	 shown	
to	 produce	 superior	 long-term	 outcomes	 compared	 with	 starting	
methotrexate	alone,	the	usual	approach	is	to	begin	with	methotrex-
ate	 and	 rapidly	 step	 up	 (e.g.,	 after	 3–6	 months)	 to	 a	 combination	
of	 DMARDs	 or	 an	 anti-TNF	 or	 non-TNF	 biological	 agent	 in	 the	
absence	of	an	adequate	therapeutic	response.

Some	patients	may	not	respond	to	an	anti-TNF	drug	or	may	be	
intolerant	of	its	side	effects.	Initial	responders	to	an	anti-TNF	agent	
who	later	experience	worsening	of	their	condition	may	benefit	from	
switching	 to	 another	 anti-TNF	 agent	 or	 an	 alternative	 biological	
with	a	different	mechanism	of	action.	Indeed,	some	studies	suggest	
that	switching	to	an	alternative	biological	such	as	abatacept	is	more	
effective	 than	 switching	 to	 another	 anti-TNF	 drug.	 Unacceptable	
toxicity	 from	 an	 anti-TNF	 agent	 may	 also	 call	 for	 switching	 to	
another	 biological	 or	 tsDMARD	 with	 a	 different	 mechanism	 of	
action	or	a	conventional	DMARD	regimen.

Studies	have	also	shown	that	oral	triple	therapy	(hydroxychloro-
quine,	methotrexate,	and	sulfasalazine)	may	be	used	effectively	for	
the	treatment	of	early	RA.	Treatment	may	be	initiated	with	metho-
trexate	alone	and,	lacking	an	adequate	treatment	response,	followed	
within	6	months	by	a	step-up	to	oral	triple	therapy.

A	clinical	state	defined	as	low	disease	activity	or	remission	is	the	
optimal	goal	of	therapy,	although	most	patients	never	achieve	com-
plete	remission	despite	every	effort	to	achieve	it.	Composite	indices,	
such	as	the	Disease	Activity	Score-28	(DAS-28),	are	useful	for	clas-
sifying	 states	 of	 low	 disease	 activity	 and	 remission;	 however,	 they	
are	imperfect	tools	due	to	the	limitations	of	the	clinical	joint	exami-
nation	 in	 which	 low-grade	 synovitis	 may	 escape	 detection.	 Com-
plete	 remission	 has	 been	 stringently	 defined	 as	 the	 total	 absence	
of	all	articular	and	extraarticular	inflammation	and	immunologic	
activity	related	to	RA.	However,	evidence	for	this	state	can	be	diffi-
cult	to	demonstrate	in	clinical	practice.	In	an	effort	to	standardize	
and	simplify	the	definition	of	remission	for	clinical	trials,	the	ACR	
and	 EULAR	 developed	 two	 provisional	 operational	 definitions	 of	
remission	 in	 RA	 (Table  358-3).	 A	 patient	 may	 be	 considered	 in	
remission	 if	 the	 patient	 (1)	 meets	 all	 the	 clinical	 and	 laboratory	
criteria	listed	in	Table	358-3	or	(2)	has	a	composite	SDAI	score	of	
<3.3.	 The	 SDAI	 is	 calculated	 by	 taking	 the	 sum	 of	 a	 tender	 joint	
and	swollen	joint	count	(using	28	joints),	patient	global	assessment	
(0–10	scale),	physician	global	assessment	(0–10	scale),	and	CRP	(in	
mg/dL).	 This	 definition	 of	 remission	 does	 not	 take	 into	 account	
the	 possibility	 of	 subclinical	 synovitis	 or	 that	 damage	 alone	 may	
produce	a	tender	or	swollen	joint.	Ignoring	the	semantics	of	these	
definitions,	the	aforementioned	remission	criteria	are	nonetheless	
useful	for	setting	a	level	of	disease	control	that	will	likely	result	in	
minimal	or	no	progression	of	structural	damage	and	disability.	
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ASSISTIVE DEVICES
In	principle,	all	patients	with	RA	should	receive	a	prescription	for	
exercise	and	physical	activity.	Dynamic	strength	training,	commu-
nity-based	 comprehensive	 physical	 therapy,	 and	 physical-activity	
coaching	(emphasizing	achieving	150	min	of	moderate-to-vigorous	
physical	activity	per	week)	have	all	been	shown	to	improve	muscle	
strength	 and	 perceived	 health	 status,	 as	 well	 as	 improve	 DAS-28	
scores	and	inflammatory	markers.	Foot	orthotics	for	painful	valgus	
deformity	decrease	foot	pain	and	may	reduce	disability	and	func-
tional	 limitations.	 Judicious	 use	 of	 wrist	 splints	 can	 also	 decrease

pain;	however,	their	benefits	may	be	offset	by	decreased	dexterity	
and	variably	curb	grip	strength.	
SURGERY
Surgical	 procedures	 may	 improve	 pain	 and	 disability	 in	 RA	 with	
varying	 degrees	 of	 reported	 long-term	 success—most	 notably	 the	
hands,	wrists,	and	feet.	For	large	joints,	such	as	the	knee,	hip,	shoul-
der,	or	elbow,	the	preferred	option	for	advanced	joint	disease	may	
be	total	joint	arthroplasty.	A	few	surgical	options	exist	for	dealing	
with	the	smaller	hand	joints.	Silicone	implants	are	the	most	com-
mon	prosthetic	for	MCP	arthroplasty	and	are	generally	implanted	
in	 patients	 with	 severe	 decreased	 arc	 of	 motion,	 marked	 flexion	
contractures,	 MCP	 joint	 pain	 with	 radiographic	 abnormalities,	
and	severe	ulnar	drift.	Arthrodesis	and	total	wrist	arthroplasty	are	
reserved	for	patients	with	severe	disease	who	have	substantial	pain	
and	functional	impairment.	These	two	procedures	appear	to	have	
equal	 efficacy	 in	 terms	 of	 pain	 control	 and	 patient	 satisfaction.	
Numerous	surgical	options	exist	for	correction	of	hallux	valgus	in	
the	forefoot,	including	arthrodesis	and	arthroplasty,	as	well	as	pri-
marily	arthrodesis	for	refractory	hindfoot	pain.	

OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS	
Pregnancy  Up	 to	 75%	 of	 female	 RA	 patients	 will	 note	 overall	
improvement	 in	 symptoms	 during	 pregnancy	 but	 often	 will	 flare	
after	 delivery.	 Flares	 during	 pregnancy	 are	 generally	 treated	 with	
low	doses	of	prednisone;	hydroxychloroquine	and	sulfasalazine	are	
probably	the	safest	DMARDs	to	use	during	pregnancy.	Methotrex-
ate	and	leflunomide	therapy	are	contraindicated	during	pregnancy	
due	 to	 their	 teratogenicity	 in	 animals	 and	 humans.	 The	 experi-
ence	 with	 biologic	 agents	 has	 been	 insufficient	 to	 make	 specific	
recommendations	 for	 their	 use	 during	 pregnancy.	 Many	 patients	
will	discontinue	biologic	agents	during	pregnancy;	however,	active	
inflammatory	disease	is	associated	with	worse	pregnancy	outcomes,	
and	thus	controlling	disease	activity	may	take	precedence.	In	gen-
eral,	biologics	are	thought	to	be	safe	through	the	second	trimester.	
Elderly Patients  RA	presents	in	up	to	one-third	of	patients	after	the	
age	of	60;	however,	older	individuals	may	receive	less	aggressive	treat-
ment	due	to	concerns	about	increased	risks	of	drug	toxicity.	Studies	
suggest	that	conventional	DMARDs	and	biological	agents	are	equally	
effective	and	safe	in	younger	and	older	patients.	Due	to	comorbidi-
ties,	many	elderly	patients	have	an	increased	risk	of	infection.	Aging	
also	leads	to	a	gradual	decline	in	renal	function	that	may	raise	the	risk	
for	side	effects	from	NSAIDs	and	some	DMARDS,	such	as	metho-
trexate.	 Renal	 function	 must	 be	 taken	 into	 consideration	 before	
prescribing	methotrexate,	which	is	mostly	cleared	by	the	kidneys.	To	
reduce	the	risks	of	side	effects,	methotrexate	doses	may	need	to	be	
adjusted	downward	for	the	drop	in	renal	function	that	usually	comes	
with	the	seventh	and	eighth	decades	of	life.	Methotrexate	is	usually	
not	prescribed	for	patients	with	a	serum	creatinine	>2	mg/dL.

GLOBAL CHALLENGES
Developing	countries	are	finding	an	increase	in	the	incidence	of	non-
communicable,	chronic	diseases	such	as	diabetes,	cardiovascular	dis-
ease,	and	RA	in	the	face	of	ongoing	poverty,	rampant	infectious	disease,	
and	poor	access	to	modern	health	care	facilities.	In	these	areas,	patients	
tend	to	have	a	greater	delay	in	diagnosis	and	limited	access	to	special-
ists	and,	thus,	greater	disease	activity	and	disability	at	presentation.	In	
addition,	infection	risk	remains	a	significant	issue	for	the	treatment	of	
RA	in	developing	countries	because	of	the	immunosuppression	associ-
ated	with	the	use	of	glucocorticoids	and	most	DMARDs.	For	example,	
in	 some	 developing	 countries,	 patients	 undergoing	 treatment	 for	 RA	
have	 a	 substantial	 increase	 in	 the	 incidence	 of	 tuberculosis,	 which	
demands	 the	 implementation	 of	 far	 more	 comprehensive	 screening	
practices	 and	 liberal	 use	 of	 isoniazid	 prophylaxis	 than	 in	 developed	
countries.	 The	 increased	 prevalence	 of	 hepatitis	 B	 and	 C,	 as	 well	 as	
human	immunodeficiency	virus	(HIV),	in	these	developing	countries	

also	poses	challenges.	Reactivation	of	viral	hepatitis	has	been	observed	
in	 association	 with	 some	 of	 the	 DMARDs,	 such	 as	 rituximab.	 Also,	
reduced	access	to	antiretroviral	therapy	may	limit	the	control	of	HIV	
infection	and	therefore	the	choice	of	DMARD	therapies.

Despite	 these	 challenges,	 one	 should	 attempt	 to	 initiate	 early	
treatment	 of	 RA	 in	 the	 developing	 countries	 with	 the	 resources	 at	
hand.	 Hydroxychloroquine,	 sulfasalazine,	 and	 methotrexate	 are	 all	
reasonably	 accessible	 throughout	 the	 world	 where	 they	 can	 be	 used	
as	 both	 monotherapy	 and	 in	 combination	 with	 other	 drugs.	 The	 use	
of	biological	agents	is	increasing	in	the	developed	countries	as	well	as	
in	other	areas	around	the	world,	although	their	use	is	limited	by	high	
cost;	national	protocols	restrict	their	use,	and	concerns	remain	about	
the	risk	for	opportunistic	infections.

SUMMARY
Improved	understanding	of	the	pathogenesis	of	RA	and	its	treatment	
has	 dramatically	 revolutionized	 the	 management	 of	 this	 disease.	
The	outcomes	of	patients	with	RA	are	vastly	superior	to	those	of	the	
prebiologic	modifier	era;	more	patients	than	in	years	past	are	able	to	
avoid	 significant	 disability	 and	 continue	 working,	 albeit	 with	 some	
job	 modifications	 in	 many	 cases.	 The	 need	 for	 early	 and	 aggressive	
treatment	of	RA	as	well	as	frequent	follow-up	visits	for	monitoring	of	
drug	therapy	has	implications	for	our	health	care	system.	Primary	care	
physicians	and	rheumatologists	must	be	prepared	to	work	together	as	
a	team	to	reach	the	ambitious	goals	of	best	practice.	In	many	settings,	
rheumatologists	have	reengineered	their	practice	in	a	way	that	places	
high	priority	on	consultations	for	any	new	patient	with	early	inflam-
matory	arthritis.

The	 therapeutic	 regimens	 for	 RA	 are	 becoming	 increasingly	 com-
plex	 with	 the	 rapidly	 expanding	 armamentarium.	 Patients	 receiving	
these	therapies	must	be	carefully	monitored	by	both	the	primary	care	
physician	and	the	rheumatologist	to	minimize	the	risk	of	side	effects	
and	identify	quickly	any	complications	of	chronic	immunosuppression.	
Also,	 prevention	 and	 treatment	 of	 RA-associated	 conditions	 such	 as	
ischemic	heart	disease	and	osteoporosis	will	likely	benefit	from	a	team	
approach	owing	to	the	value	of	multidisciplinary	care.

Research	 will	 continue	 to	 search	 for	 new	 therapies	 with	 superior	
efficacy	and	safety	profiles	and	investigate	treatment	strategies	that	can	
bring	the	disease	under	control	more	rapidly	and	nearer	to	remission.	
However,	 prevention	 and	 cure	 of	 RA	 will	 likely	 require	 new	 break-
throughs	 in	 our	 understanding	 of	 disease	 pathogenesis.	 Several	 pre-
vention	trials	in	RA	are	currently	underway	and	focus	on	a	variety	of	
prevention	strategies	in	individuals	who	have	serologic	and/or	clinical	
features	at	higher	risk	than	the	general	population	for	developing	RA.	
Equally	 important	 is	 the	 identification	 of	 predictive	 biomarkers	 that	
enable	a	personalized	approach	to	DMARD	therapy	for	RA.

359 Acute Rheumatic Fever

Joseph Kado, Jonathan Carapetis

Acute	rheumatic	fever	(ARF)	is	a	multisystem	disease	resulting	from	
an	 autoimmune	 reaction	 to	 infection	 with	 group	 A	 Streptococcus.	
Although	 many	 parts	 of	 the	 body	 may	 be	 affected,	 almost	 all	 of	 the	
manifestations	 resolve	 completely.	 The	 major	 exception	 is	 cardiac	
valvular	damage	(rheumatic	heart	disease	[RHD]),	which	may	persist	
after	the	other	features	have	disappeared.

GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
ARF	and	RHD	are	diseases	of	poverty.	They	were	common	in	all	coun-
tries	until	the	early	twentieth	century,	when	their	incidence	began	to	
decline	in	industrialized	nations.	This	decline	was	largely	attributable	
to	improved	living	conditions—particularly	less	crowded	housing	and	
better	 hygiene—which	 resulted	 in	 reduced	 transmission	 of	 group	 A	
streptococci.	The	introduction	of	antibiotics	and	improved	systems	of	
medical	care	had	a	supplemental	effect.

The	 virtual	 disappearance	 of	 ARF	 and	 reduction	 in	 the	 incidence	
of	RHD	in	industrialized	countries	during	the	first	half	of	the	twenti-
eth	century	unfortunately	was	not	replicated	in	developing	countries,	
where	 these	 diseases	 continue	 unabated.	 RHD	 is	 the	 most	 common	
cause	 of	 acquired	 heart	 disease	 in	 children	 in	 developing	 countries	
and	is	a	major	cause	of	mortality	and	morbidity	in	adults	as	well.	It	has	

been	estimated	that	between	29.7	and	43.1	million	people	worldwide	
are	affected	by	RHD,	with	>300,000	deaths	occurring	each	year.	Some	
95%	of	ARF	cases	and	RHD	deaths	now	occur	in	developing	countries,	
with	 particularly	 high	 rates	 in	 sub-Saharan	 Africa,	 Pacific	 nations,	
Australasia,	 and	 South	 and	 Central	 Asia.	 The	 pathogenetic	 pathway	
from	 exposure	 to	 group	 A	 Streptococcus	 followed	 by	 pharyngeal	 or	
superficial	 skin	 infection	 and	 subsequent	 development	 of	 ARF,	 ARF	
recurrences,	and	development	of	RHD	and	its	complications	is	associ-
ated	with	a	range	of	risk	factors	and,	therefore,	potential	interventions	
at	each	point	(Fig. 359-1).	In	affluent	countries,	many	of	these	risk	fac-
tors	are	well	controlled,	and	where	needed,	interventions	are	in	place.	
Unfortunately,	 the	 greatest	 burden	 of	 disease	 is	 found	 in	 developing	
countries,	 most	 of	 which	 do	 not	 have	 the	 resources,	 capacity,	 and/or	
interest	to	tackle	this	multifaceted	disease.	In	particular,	few	developing	
countries	 have	 a	 coordinated,	 register-based	 RHD	 control	 program,	
which	is	proven	to	be	cost-effective	in	reducing	the	burden	of	RHD.	
Enhancing	awareness	of	RHD	and	mobilizing	resources	for	its	control	
in	developing	countries	are	issues	requiring	international	attention.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
ARF	 is	 mainly	 a	 disease	 of	 children	 age	 5–14	 years.	 Initial	 episodes	
become	 less	 common	 in	 older	 adolescents	 and	 young	 adults	 and	 are	
rare	 in	 persons	 aged	 >30	 years.	 By	 contrast,	 recurrent	 episodes	 of	
ARF	remain	relatively	common	in	adolescents	and	young	adults.	This	
pattern	 contrasts	 with	 the	 prevalence	 of	 RHD,	 which	 peaks	 between		
25	and	40	years.	There	is	no	clear	gender	association	for	ARF,	but	RHD	
more	commonly	affects	females,	sometimes	up	to	twice	as	frequently	
as	males.

PATHOGENESIS
 ■ ORGANISM FACTORS
Conventional	 teaching	 has	 it	 that	 ARF	 is	 exclusively	 caused	 by	
infection	 of	 the	 upper	 respiratory	 tract	 with	 group	 A	 streptococci	
(Chap.  148).	 Although	 classically,	 certain	 M-serotypes	 (particularly	
types	1,	3,	5,	6,	14,	18,	19,	24,	27,	and	29)	were	associated	with	ARF,	
recent	evidence	demonstrates	that	many	more	M-serotypes	are	rheu-
matogenic	 and	 that	 so-called	 “rheumatogenic	 motifs”	 are	 found	 in	
only	a	minority	of	serotypes	associated	with	rheumatic	fever.	This	epi-
demiologic	evidence	also	points	to	a	clear	role	of	skin	infection	in	the	
pathogenesis	of	ARF.	The	potential	role	of	groups	C	and	G	streptococci	
is	unclear	at	this	time.

 ■ HOST FACTORS
Based	on	epidemiologic	evidence,	~3–6%	of	any	population	may	be	sus-
ceptible	to	ARF,	and	this	proportion	does	not	vary	dramatically	between	
populations.	Findings	of	familial	clustering	of	cases	and	concordance	
in	monozygotic	twins—particularly	for	chorea—confirm	that	suscep-
tibility	to	ARF	is	an	inherited	characteristic,	with	44%	concordance	in	
monozygotic	 twins	 compared	 to	 12%	 in	 dizygotic	 twins	 and	 herita-
bility	more	recently	estimated	at	60%.	Most	evidence	for	host	factors	
focuses	on	immunologic	determinants.	Some	human	leukocyte	antigen	
(HLA)	 class	 II	 alleles,	 particularly	 HLA-DR7	 and	 HLA-DR4,	 appear	
to	be	associated	with	susceptibility,	whereas	other	class	II	alleles	have	
been	 associated	 with	 protection	 (HLA-DR5,	 HLA-DR6,	 HLA-DR51,	
HLA-DR52,	 and	 HLA-DQ).	 Associations	 have	 also	 been	 described	
with	 polymorphisms	 at	 the	 tumor	 necrosis	 factor	 α	 locus	 (TNF-α-
308	 and	 TNF-α-238),	 high	 levels	 of	 circulating	 mannose-binding		
lectin,	and	Toll-like	receptors.	Recent	genome-wide	association	studies	
in	different	populations	have	identified	connections	at	the	HLA	region,	
particularly	 HLA-DQA1	 to	 HLA-DQB1,	 and	 the	 immunoglobulin	
heavy	chain	locus.

 ■ THE IMMUNE RESPONSE
The	 most	 widely	 accepted	 theory	 of	 rheumatic	 fever	 pathogenesis	
is	 based	 on	 the	 concept	 of	 molecular	 mimicry,	 whereby	 an	 immune	
response	 targeted	 at	 streptococcal	 antigens	 (mainly	 thought	 to	 be	
on	 the	 M	 protein	 and	 the	 N-acetylglucosamine	 of	 group	 A	 strepto-
coccal	 carbohydrate)	 also	 recognizes	 human	 tissues.	 In	 this	 model,	
cross-reactive	antibodies	bind	to	endothelial	cells	on	the	heart	valve,	
leading	to	activation	of	the	adhesion	molecule	VCAM-1,	with	result-
ing	recruitment	of	activated	lymphocytes	and	lysis	of	endothelial	cells	
in	the	presence	of	complement.	The	latter	leads	to	release	of	peptides	
including	laminin,	keratin,	and	tropomyosin,	which,	in	turn,	activates	
cross-reactive	T	cells	that	invade	the	heart,	amplifying	the	damage	and	
causing	epitope	spreading.	An	alternative	hypothesis	proposes	that	the	
initial	 damage	 is	 due	 to	 streptococcal	 invasion	 of	 epithelial	 surfaces,	
with	binding	of	M	protein	to	type	IV	collagen	allowing	it	to	become	
immunogenic,	but	not	through	the	mechanism	of	molecular	mimicry.

CLINICAL FEATURES
There	is	a	latent	period	of	~3	weeks	(1–5	weeks)	between	the	precipitat-
ing	group	A	streptococcal	infection	and	the	appearance	of	the	clinical	
features	of	ARF.	The	exceptions	are	chorea	and	indolent	carditis,	which	
may	follow	prolonged	latent	periods	lasting	up	to	6	months.	Although	
many	patients	report	a	prior	sore	throat,	the	preceding	group	A	strep-
tococcal	infection	is	commonly	subclinical;	in	these	cases,	it	can	only	
be	confirmed	using	streptococcal	antibody	testing.	The	most	common	
clinical	features	are	polyarthritis	(present	in	60–75%	of	cases)	and	car-
ditis	(50–75%).	The	prevalence	of	chorea	in	ARF	varies	substantially	
between	populations,	ranging	from	<2	to	30%.	Erythema	marginatum	
and	subcutaneous	nodules	are	now	rare,	being	found	in	<5%	of	cases.

 ■ HEART INVOLVEMENT
Up	to	75%	of	patients	with	ARF	progress	to	RHD.	The	endocardium,	
pericardium,	 or	 myocardium	 may	 be	 affected.	 Valvular	 damage	 is	
the	hallmark	of	rheumatic	carditis.	The	mitral	valve	is	almost	always	
affected,	sometimes	together	with	the	aortic	valve;	isolated	aortic	valve

involvement	 is	 rare.	 Damage	 to	 the	 pulmonary	 or	 tricuspid	 valves	 is	
usually	 secondary	 to	 increased	 pulmonary	 pressures	 resulting	 from	
left-sided	 valvular	 disease.	 Early	 valvular	 damage	 leads	 to	 regurgi-
tation.	 Over	 ensuing	 years,	 usually	 as	 a	 result	 of	 recurrent	 episodes,	
leaflet	 thickening,	 scarring,	 calcification,	 and	 valvular	 stenosis	 may	
develop	 (Fig.  359-2).	 See  Videos  359-1  and  359-2.	 Therefore,	 the	
characteristic	 manifestation	 of	 carditis	 in	 previously	 unaffected	 indi-
viduals	 is	 mitral	 regurgitation,	 sometimes	 accompanied	 by	 aortic	
regurgitation.	Myocardial	inflammation	may	affect	electrical	conduc-
tion	pathways,	leading	to	P-R	interval	prolongation	(first-degree	atri-
oventricular	 block	 or	 rarely	 higher-level	 block)	 and	 softening	 of	 the	
first	heart	sound.

People	 with	 RHD	 are	 often	 asymptomatic	 for	 many	 years	 before	
their	 valvular	 disease	 progresses	 to	 cause	 cardiac	 failure.	 Moreover,	
particularly	 in	 resource-poor	 settings,	 the	 diagnosis	 of	 ARF	 is	 often	
not	made,	so	children,	adolescents,	and	young	adults	may	have	RHD	
but	 not	 know	 it.	 These	 cases	 can	 be	 diagnosed	 using	 echocardiogra-
phy;	auscultation	is	poorly	sensitive	and	specific	for	RHD	diagnosis	in	
asymptomatic	 patients.	 Echocardiographic	 screening	 of	 school-aged	
children	 in	 populations	 with	 high	 rates	 of	 RHD	 is	 becoming	 more	
widespread	and	has	been	facilitated	by	improving	technologies	in	por-
table	echocardiography	and	the	availability	of	consensus	guidelines	for	
the	diagnosis	of	RHD	on	echocardiography	(Table 359-1).	Although	a	
diagnosis	of	definite	RHD	on	screening	echocardiography	should	lead	
to	commencement	of	secondary	prophylaxis,	the	clinical	significance	
of	borderline	RHD	has	yet	to	be	determined.
 ■ JOINT INVOLVEMENT
The	 most	 common	 form	 of	 joint	 involvement	 in	 ARF	 is	 arthritis,	
i.e.,	 objective	 evidence	 of	 inflammation,	 with	 hot,	 swollen,	 red,	 and/
or	 tender	 joints,	 and	 involvement	 of	 more	 than	 one	 joint	 (i.e.,	 pol-
yarthritis).	Polyarthritis	is	typically	migratory,	moving	from	one	joint	
to	another	over	a	period	of	hours.	ARF	almost	always	affects	the	large	
joints—most	 commonly	 the	 knees,	 ankles,	 hips,	 and	 elbows—and	 is	
asymmetric.	 The	 pain	 is	 severe	 and	 usually	 disabling	 until	 anti-	
inflammatory	medication	is	commenced.

Less	 severe	 joint	 involvement	 is	 also	 relatively	 common	 and	 has	
been	 recognized	 as	 a	 potential	 major	 manifestation	 in	 high-risk

populations	in	the	most	recent	revision	of	the	Jones	criteria.	Arthralgia	
without	objective	joint	inflammation	usually	affects	large	joints	in	the	
same	migratory	pattern	as	polyarthritis.	In	some	populations,	aseptic	
monoarthritis	may	be	a	presenting	feature	of	ARF,	which	may,	in	turn,	
result	 from	 early	 commencement	 of	 anti-inflammatory	 medication	
before	the	typical	migratory	pattern	is	established.

The	joint	manifestations	of	ARF	are	highly	responsive	to	salicylates	
and	 other	 nonsteroidal	 anti-inflammatory	 drugs	 (NSAIDs).	 Indeed,	
joint	involvement	that	persists	for	more	than	1	or	2	days	after	starting	
salicylates	is	unlikely	to	be	due	to	ARF.
 ■ CHOREA
Sydenham’s	chorea	commonly	occurs	in	the	absence	of	other	manifes-
tations,	follows	a	prolonged	latent	period	after	group	A	streptococcal	
infection,	and	is	found	mainly	in	females.	The	choreiform	movements	
affect	particularly	the	head	(causing	characteristic	darting	movements	
of	 the	 tongue)	 and	 the	 upper	 limbs	 (Chap.  436).	 They	 may	 be	 gen-
eralized	or	restricted	to	one	side	of	the	body	(hemi-chorea).	In	mild	
cases,	chorea	may	be	evident	only	on	careful	examination,	whereas	in	
the	most	severe	cases,	the	affected	individuals	are	unable	to	perform	
activities	 of	 daily	 living.	 There	 is	 often	 associated	 emotional	 lability	
or	obsessive-compulsive	traits,	which	may	last	longer	than	the	chorei-
form	movements	(which	usually	resolve	within	6	weeks	but	sometimes	
may	take	up	to	6	months).	More	than	50%	of	patients	presenting	with	
chorea	will	have	carditis,	for	which	reason	echocardiography	should	be	
part	of	the	workup.

 ■ SKIN MANIFESTATIONS
The	 classic	 rash	 of	 ARF	 is	 erythema  marginatum	 (Chap.  19),	 which	
begins	 as	 pink	 macules	 that	 clear	 centrally,	 leaving	 a	 serpiginous,	
spreading	 edge.	 The	 rash	 is	 evanescent,	 appearing	 and	 disappearing	
before	the	examiner’s	eyes.	It	occurs	usually	on	the	trunk,	sometimes	
on	the	limbs,	but	almost	never	on	the	face.

Subcutaneous nodules	occur	as	painless,	small	(0.5–2	cm),	mobile	lumps	
beneath	the	skin	overlying	bony	prominences,	particularly	of	the	hands,	
feet,	elbows,	occiput,	and	occasionally	the	vertebrae.	They	are	a	delayed	
manifestation,	appearing	2–3	weeks	after	the	onset	of	disease,	last	for	just	
a	few	days	up	to	3	weeks,	and	are	commonly	associated	with	carditis.
 ■ OTHER FEATURES
Fever	 occurs	 in	 most	 cases	 of	 ARF,	 although	 rarely	 in	 cases	 of	 pure	
chorea.	 Although	 high-grade	 fever	 (≥39°C)	 is	 the	 rule,	 lower	 grade	
temperature	elevations	are	not	uncommon.	Elevated	acute-phase	reac-
tants	are	also	present	in	most	cases.
 ■ EVIDENCE OF A PRECEDING GROUP A 
STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTION
With	 the	 exception	 of	 chorea	 and	 low-grade	 carditis,	 both	 of	 which	
may	 become	 manifest	 many	 months	 later,	 evidence	 of	 a	 preceding	
group	A	streptococcal	infection	is	essential	in	making	the	diagnosis	of	
ARF.	Because	most	cases	do	not	have	a	positive	throat	swab	culture	or	
rapid	antigen	test,	serologic	evidence	is	usually	needed.	The	most	com-
mon	serologic	tests	are	the	anti-streptolysin	O	(ASO)	and	anti-DNase	
B	 (ADB)	 titers.	 Where	 possible,	 age-specific	 reference	 ranges	 should	
be	determined	in	a	local	population	of	healthy	people	without	a	recent	
group	A	streptococcal	infection.
 ■ CONFIRMING THE DIAGNOSIS
Because	there	is	no	definitive	test,	the	diagnosis	of	ARF	relies	on	the	
presence	 of	 a	 combination	 of	 typical	 clinical	 features	 together	 with	
evidence	of	the	precipitating	group	A	streptococcal	infection,	and	the	
exclusion	of	other	diagnoses.	This	uncertainty	led	Dr.	T.	Duckett	Jones	
in	1944	to	develop	a	set	of	criteria	(subsequently	known	as	the	Jones 
criteria)	to	aid	in	the	diagnosis.	The	most	recent	revision	of	the	Jones	
criteria	(Table 359-2)	requires	the	clinician	to	determine	if	the	patient	
is	from	a	setting	or	population	known	to	experience	low	rates	of	ARF.	
For	this	group,	there	is	a	set	of	“low-risk”	criteria;	for	all	others,	there	is	
a	set	of	more	sensitive	criteria.

TREATMENT
Acute Rheumatic Fever

Patients	 with	 possible	 ARF	 should	 be	 followed	 closely	 to	 ensure	
that	the	diagnosis	is	confirmed,	treatment	of	heart	failure	and	other	
symptoms	is	undertaken,	and	preventive	measures	including	com-
mencement	of	secondary	prophylaxis,	inclusion	on	an	ARF	registry,	
and	health	education	are	commenced.	Echocardiography	should	be	
performed	on	all	possible	cases	to	aid	in	making	the	diagnosis	and	
to	determine	the	severity	at	baseline	of	any	carditis.	Other	tests	that	
should	be	performed	are	listed	in	Table 359-3.

There	is	no	treatment	for	ARF	that	has	been	proven	to	alter	the	
likelihood	of	developing,	or	the	severity	of,	RHD.	With	the	excep-
tion	of	treatment	of	heart	failure,	which	may	be	life-saving	in	cases	
of	severe	carditis,	the	treatment	of	ARF	is	symptomatic.	
ANTIBIOTICS
All	patients	with	ARF	should	receive	antibiotics	sufficient	to	treat	
the	 precipitating	 group	 A	 streptococcal	 infection	 (Chap.  148).	
Penicillin	 is	 the	 drug	 of	 choice	 and	 can	 be	 given	 orally	 (as	 phe-
noxymethyl	 penicillin,	 500	 mg	 [250	 mg	 for	 children	 ≤27	 kg]	 PO	
twice	 daily,	 or	 amoxicillin,	 50	 mg/kg	 [maximum,	 1	 g]	 daily,	 for	 	
10	days)	or	as	a	single	dose	of	1.2	million	units	(600,000	units	for	
children	≤27	kg)	IM	benzathine	penicillin	G.	
SALICYLATES AND NSAIDS
These	 may	 be	 used	 for	 the	 treatment	 of	 arthritis,	 arthralgia,	 and	
fever,	 once	 the	 diagnosis	 is	 confirmed.	 They	 are	 of	 no	 proven

per year. bSubclinical carditis indicates echocardiographic valvulitis. (See source 
document.) cPolyarthralgia should only be considered as a major manifestation 
in moderate- to high-risk populations after exclusion of other causes. As in past 
versions of the criteria, erythema marginatum and SC nodules are rarely “stand-
alone” major criteria. Additionally, joint manifestations can only be considered in 
either the major or minor categories but not both in the same patient. (See source 
document for more information.) dCRP value must be greater than upper limit of 
normal for laboratory. Also, because ESR may evolve during the course of ARF, peak 
ESR values should be used. eProlonged PR interval can only be considered in the 
absence of carditis as a major criterion.

value	in	the	treatment	of	carditis	or	chorea.	Aspirin	is	a	common

first	2	weeks,	patients	on	higher	doses	can	have	the	dose	reduced	to	
50–60	mg/kg	per	day	for	a	further	2–4	weeks.	Fever,	joint	manifes-
tations,	and	elevated	acute-phase	reactants	sometimes	recur	up	to		
3	weeks	after	the	medication	is	discontinued.	This	does	not	indicate	
a	recurrence	and	can	be	managed	by	recommencing	salicylates	for	
a	brief	period.	Many	clinicians	prefer	to	use	naproxen	at	a	dose	of	
10–20	mg/kg	per	day,	because	it	may	be	safer	than	aspirin	and	has	
the	advantage	of	twice-daily	dosing.	
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE	
Glucocorticoids  The	use	of	glucocorticoids	in	ARF	remains	con-
troversial.	Two	meta-analyses	have	failed	to	demonstrate	a	benefit	
of	glucocorticoids	compared	to	placebo	or	salicylates	in	improving	
the	short-	or	longer-term	outcome	of	carditis.	However,	the	studies	
included	in	these	meta-analyses	all	took	place	>40	years	ago	and	did	
not	use	medications	in	common	usage	today.	Many	clinicians	treat	
cases	of	severe	carditis	(causing	heart	failure)	with	glucocorticoids	

TABLE 359-3  Testing and Monitoring of ARF in the Acute Setting
Investigations

Always request:
•	 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
•	 Echocardiogram
•	 Complete blood count (CBC)
•	 C-reactive protein (CRP)
•	 Streptococcal serology (antistreptolysin and anti-DNase B)
In relevant situations:
•	 Throat swab
•	 Skin sore swab
•	 Blood cultures
•	 Synovial fluid aspirate

•	 Ensure sample does not clot by using correct tubes that have been well 

mixed and transported promptly to the laboratory

•	 Include request for cell count, microscopy, culture, and gonococcal 

polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

•	 Pregnancy test
•	 Creatinine test (UEC [urea, electrolytes, creatinine]) since nonsteroidal  

anti-inflammatory drugs can affect renal function

Tests to exclude alternative diagnoses, depending on clinical presentation and 
locally endemic infections:
•	 Autoantibodies, double-stranded DNA, anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide  

(anti-CCP) antibodies

•	 Urine for Neisseria gonorrhoeae molecular test
•	 Urine for Chlamydia trachomatis molecular test
•	 Serologic or other testing for viral hepatitis, Yersinia spp., cytomegalovirus 
(CMV), parvovirus B19, respiratory viruses, Ross River virus, Barmah  
Forest virus

in	the	belief	that	they	may	reduce	the	acute	inflammation	and	result	
in	more	rapid	resolution	of	failure.	However,	the	potential	benefits	
of	 this	 treatment	 should	 be	 balanced	 against	 the	 possible	 adverse	
effects.	 If	 used,	 prednisone	 or	 prednisolone	 is	 recommended	 at	 a	
dose	of	1–2	mg/kg	per	day	(maximum,	80	mg),	usually	for	a	few	
days	or	up	to	a	maximum	of	3	weeks.	

MANAGEMENT OF HEART FAILURE
See Chap. 258.	

BED REST
Traditional	recommendations	for	long-term	bed	rest,	once	the	cor-
nerstone	 of	 management,	 are	 no	 longer	 widely	 practiced.	 Instead,	
bed	rest	should	be	prescribed	as	needed	while	arthritis	and	arthral-
gia	are	present	and	for	patients	with	heart	failure.	Once	symptoms	
are	well	controlled,	gradual	mobilization	can	commence	as	tolerated.	
CHOREA
Medications	 to	 control	 the	 abnormal	 movements	 do	 not	 alter	 the	
duration	or	outcome	of	chorea.	Milder	cases	can	usually	be	man-
aged	by	providing	a	calm	environment.	In	patients	with	severe	cho-
rea,	carbamazepine	or	sodium	valproate	is	preferred	to	haloperidol.	
A	response	may	not	be	seen	for	1–2	weeks,	and	medication	should	
be	continued	for	1–2	weeks	after	symptoms	subside.	There	is	recent	
evidence	 that	 corticosteroids	 are	 effective	 and	 lead	 to	 more	 rapid	
symptom	reduction	in	chorea.	They	should	be	considered	in	severe	
or	refractory	cases.	Prednisone	or	prednisolone	may	be	commenced	
at	 0.5	 mg/kg	 daily,	 with	 weaning	 as	 early	 as	 possible,	 preferably	
after	1	week	if	symptoms	are	reduced,	although	slower	weaning	or	
temporary	dose	escalation	may	be	required	if	symptoms	worsen.	

INTRAVENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULIN (IVIG)
Small	 studies	 have	 suggested	 that	 IVIg	 may	 lead	 to	 more	 rapid	
resolution	 of	 chorea	 but	 have	 shown	 no	 benefit	 on	 the	 short-	 or

long-term	outcome	of	carditis	in	ARF	without	chorea.	In	the	absence	
of	better	data,	IVIg	is	not	recommended	except	in	cases	of	severe	
chorea	refractory	to	other	treatments.

PROGNOSIS
Untreated,	 ARF	 lasts	 on	 average	 12	 weeks.	 With	 treatment,	 patients	
are	usually	discharged	from	hospital	within	1–2	weeks.	Inflammatory	
markers	 should	 be	 monitored	 every	 1–2	 weeks	 until	 they	 have	 nor-
malized	(usually	within	4–6	weeks),	and	an	echocardiogram	should	be	
performed	after	1	month	to	determine	if	there	has	been	progression	of	
carditis.	Cases	with	more	severe	carditis	need	close	clinical	and	echoc-
ardiographic	monitoring	in	the	longer	term.

Once	the	acute	episode	has	resolved,	the	priority	in	management	is	
to	ensure	long-term	clinical	follow-up	and	adherence	to	a	regimen	of	
secondary	prophylaxis.	Patients	should	be	entered	onto	the	local	ARF	
registry	(if	present)	and	contact	made	with	primary	care	practitioners	
to	ensure	a	plan	for	follow-up	and	administration	of	secondary	prophy-
laxis	before	the	patient	is	discharged.	Patients	and	their	families	should	
also	 be	 educated	 about	 their	 disease,	 emphasizing	 the	 importance	 of	
adherence	to	secondary	prophylaxis.

PREVENTION
 ■ PRIMARY PREVENTION
Ideally,	primary	prevention	would	entail	elimination	of	the	major	risk	
factors	for	streptococcal	infection,	particularly	overcrowded	housing.	
This	is	difficult	to	achieve	in	most	places	where	ARF	is	common.

Concerted	international	efforts	are	underway	to	develop	a	vaccine	
against	group	A	Streptococcus	that	would	prevent	infection	of	the	throat	
or	skin	and	consequently	prevent	ARF	in	the	absence	of	a	suitable	vac-
cine;	 however,	 the	 mainstay	 of	 primary	 prevention	 for	 ARF	 remains	
primary	prophylaxis	(i.e.,	the	timely	and	complete	treatment	of	group	
A	 streptococcal	 sore	 throat	 with	 antibiotics).	 If	 commenced	 within		
9	days	of	sore	throat	onset,	a	course	of	penicillin	(as	outlined	above	for	
treatment	of	ARF)	will	prevent	almost	all	cases	of	ARF	that	would	oth-
erwise	have	developed.	In	settings	where	ARF	and	RHD	are	common	
but	microbiologic	diagnosis	of	group	A	streptococcal	pharyngitis	is	not	
available,	such	as	in	resource-poor	countries,	primary	care	guidelines	
often	 recommend	 that	 all	 patients	 with	 sore	 throat	 be	 treated	 with	
penicillin	or,	alternatively,	that	a	clinical	algorithm	be	used	to	identify	
patients	with	a	higher	likelihood	of	group	A	streptococcal	pharyngitis.	
Although	imperfect,	such	approaches	recognize	the	importance	of	ARF	
prevention	at	the	expense	of	overtreating	many	cases	of	sore	throat	that	
are	not	caused	by	group	A	Streptococcus.	Although	there	is	no	proof	
that	antibiotic	treatment	of	group	A	streptococcal	skin	infections	can	
prevent	 ARF,	 the	 increasing	 evidence	 that	 impetigo	 is	 strongly	 asso-
ciated	with	ARF	in	some	populations	argues	for	a	focus	on	treatment	
and	 prevention	 of	 group	 A	 streptococcal	 skin	 infections	 as	 part	 of	 a	
comprehensive	ARF	control	strategy	in	regions	with	endemic	impetigo.
 ■ SECONDARY PREVENTION
The	mainstay	of	controlling	ARF	and	RHD	is	secondary	prevention.	
Because	patients	with	ARF	are	at	dramatically	higher	risk	than	the	gen-
eral	population	of	developing	a	further	episode	of	ARF	after	a	group	
A	 streptococcal	 infection,	 they	 should	 receive	 long-term	 penicillin	
prophylaxis	to	prevent	recurrences.	The	best	antibiotic	for	secondary	
prophylaxis	 is	 benzathine	 penicillin	 G	 (1.2	 million	 units,	 or	 600,000	
units	if	≤27	kg)	delivered	every	4	weeks.	It	can	be	given	every	3	weeks,	
or	 even	 every	 2	 weeks,	 to	 persons	 considered	 to	 be	 at	 particularly	
high	risk,	although	in	settings	where	good	compliance	with	an	every-	
4-week	dosing	schedule	can	be	achieved,	more	frequent	dosing	is	rarely	
needed.	Oral	penicillin	V	(250	mg)	can	be	given	twice	daily	instead	but	
is	less	effective	than	benzathine	penicillin	G.	Penicillin-allergic	patients	
can	receive	erythromycin	(250	mg)	twice	daily.

The	 duration	 of	 secondary	 prophylaxis	

is	 determined	 by	
many	 factors,	 in	 particular	 the	 duration	 since	 the	 last	 episode	 of		
ARF	(recurrences	become	less	likely	with	increasing	time),	age	(recur-
rences	are	less	likely	with	increasing	age),	and	the	severity	of	RHD	(if	
severe,	it	may	be	prudent	to	avoid	even	a	very	small	risk	of	recurrence

360 Systemic Sclerosis 
(Scleroderma) and  
Related Disorders
John Varga

DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION
Systemic	sclerosis	(SSc)	is	an	orphan	disease	of	unknown	etiology,	com-
plex	 pathogenesis,	 and	 variable	 clinical	 presentations.	 SSc	 frequently	
follows	a	progressive	course	and	is	associated	with	significant	disability	
and	mortality.	Virtually	every	organ	can	be	affected	(Fig. 360-1).

There	is	marked	variability	among	SSc	patients	in	patterns	of	skin	
involvement	 and	 organ	 complications,	 rates	 of	 disease	 progression,	
response	to	treatment,	disease	severity,	and	survival.	The	early	stages	
of	SSc	are	associated	with	prominent	inflammatory	features,	but	over	
time,	structural	alterations	in	multiple	vascular	beds	and	visceral	organ	
dysfunction	 due	 to	 fibrosis	 and	 atrophy	 progressively	 dominate	 the	
clinical	picture.	Recently	developed	classification	criteria	for	the	diag-
nosis	of	SSc	(shown	in	Table 360-1)	are	>90%	specific	and	selective.

Although	thickened	and	indurated	skin	(scleroderma)	is	the	distin-
guishing	hallmark	of	SSc,	similar	skin	changes	can	also	be	seen	in	local-
ized	forms	of	scleroderma,	along	with	a	variety	of	metabolic,	inherited,	
autoimmune,	 and	 iatrogenic	 conditions	 (Table  360-2).	 Patients	 with	
SSc	can	be	broadly	segregated	into	two	major	subsets	defined	by	the	
pattern	of	skin	involvement	and	associated	with	characteristic	clinical	
and	serologic	features	and	natural	history	(Table 360-3).	Patients	with	
diffuse	cutaneous	SSc	(dcSSc)	have	extensive	skin	induration,	starting	
in	 the	 fingers	 (sclerodactyly)	 and	 ascending	 from	 distal	 to	 proximal	
limbs	and	the	trunk.	In	these	patients,	progressive	skin	disease,	inter-
stitial	lung	disease	(ILD),	and	less	commonly	acute	renal	involvement	
may	develop	relatively	early.	In	contrast,	in	patients	with	limited	cuta-
neous	SSc	(lcSSc),	Raynaud’s	phenomenon	generally	precedes	sclero-
dactyly	and	other	disease	manifestations,	sometimes	by	years.	In	these	
patients,	skin	involvement	remains	confined	to	the	fingers,	distal	limbs,	
and	 face,	 while	 the	 trunk	 is	 spared.	 A	 subset	 of	 patients	 with	 lcSSc

display	 the	 characteristic	 constellation	 of	 clinical	 findings	 (calcinosis	
cutis,	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon,	 esophageal	 dysmotility,	 sclerodactyly,	
and	telangiectasia),	historically	termed	the	CREST syndrome.	In	lcSSc,	
visceral	 organ	 involvement	 tends	 to	 follow	 an	 insidious	 and	 often	
benign	course,	while	digital	ischemic	ulcers,	pulmonary	arterial	hyper-
tension	 (PAH),	 hypothyroidism,	 Sjogren’s	 symptoms,	 and	 primary	
biliary	 cirrhosis	 may	 occur	 as	 late	 complications.	 In	 some	 patients,	
Raynaud’s	phenomenon	and	characteristic	clinical	and	laboratory	fea-
tures	of	SSc	occurs	in	the	absence	of	detectable	skin	thickening.	This	
relatively	benign	disease	subset	has	been	termed	SSc sine scleroderma.

INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
SSc	is	an	acquired	sporadic	disease	with	a	worldwide	distribution	and	
affecting	all	races.	In	the	United	States,	the	incidence	is	9–46	cases	per	
million	per	year.	There	are	an	estimated	100,000	U.S.	cases,	although	
this	number	may	be	significantly	higher	if	patients	who	do	not	fulfill	
classification	criteria	are	also	included.	There	are	large	regional	varia-
tions	in	incidence	rates	of	SSc,	potentially	reflecting	differences	in	case	
definition,	 environmental	 exposures,	 or	 genetic	 susceptibility	 genes	
in	populations	with	different	ancestries.	Prevalence	rates	in	England,	
northern	Europe,	and	Japan	appear	to	be	lower	than	in	North	America	
and	Australia.	Age,	sex,	and	ethnicity	influence	disease	susceptibility,	
and	 blacks	 have	 higher	 age-specific	 incidence	 rates	 and	 mortality.	 In	
common	 with	 other	 connective	 tissue	 diseases,	 SSc	 shows	 a	 strong	
female	 predominance	 (4.6:1),	 which	 is	 most	 pronounced	 in	 the	
childbearing	 years	 and	 declines	 after	 menopause.	 An	 additional	 risk	
factor	for	SSc	is	having	an	affected	first-degree	family	member,	which	
increases	disease	risk	13-fold.	Although	SSc	can	present	at	any	age,	the	
peak	age	of	onset	in	women	with	both	limited	and	diffuse	cutaneous	
forms	 is	 65–74	 years,	 although	 in	 blacks,	 disease	 onset	 occurs	 at	 an	
earlier	age.	Furthermore,	blacks	with	SSc	are	more	likely	to	have	diffuse	
cutaneous	disease,	ILD,	and	a	worse	prognosis.

GENETIC CONTRIBUTION TO DISEASE 
PATHOGENESIS

	In	general,	the	genetic	associations	of	SSc	identified	to	date	make	
only	 a	 relatively	 modest	 contribution	 to	 disease	 susceptibility.	
Twin	 studies	 showed	 low	 disease	 concordance	 rates	 (4.7%)	 in	
monozygotic	twins,	a	rate	much	lower	than	in	other	autoimmune	dis-
eases	 such	 as	 rheumatoid	 arthritis	 (12.3%).	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 sup-
porting	 the	 genetic	 contribution	 to	 disease	 susceptibility	 is	 the	
observation	that	1.6%	of	SSc	patients	have	a	first-degree	relative	with	
SSc,	a	prevalence	rate	that	is	markedly	increased	compared	to	the	gen-
eral	 population.	 Moreover,	 the	 risk	 of	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon,	 ILD,	
and	other	autoimmune	diseases,	including	systemic	lupus	erythemato-
sus	(SLE)	(Chap. 356),	rheumatoid	arthritis	(Chap. 358),	and	autoim-
mune	thyroiditis	(Chap. 383),	is	also	increased	in	first-degree	relatives	
of	patients	with	SSc.	Current	approaches	to	uncover	the	genetic	factors	
that	contribute	to	SSc	include	DNA	sequencing	and	single	nucleotide	
polymorphism	(SNP)	analysis	of	candidate	genes	and	SNP	analysis	of	
the	entire	genome	in	a	hypothesis-free	manner.	Genome-wide	associa-
tion	 studies	 (GWAS)	 involve	 large	 multicenter	 and	 multinational	
cohorts.	A	majority	of	the	robustly	validated	genetic	susceptibility	loci	
for	SSc	are	genes	at	the	highly	polymorphic	human	leukocyte	antigen	
(HLA)	region	and	other	genes	involved	in	innate	and	adaptive	immu-
nity	and	interferon	responses,	highlighting	the	importance	of	autoim-
munity	as	the	initial	trigger	for	the	disease.	Genetic	studies	have	shown	
associations	with	common	(small	effect	size)	variants	related	to	B	and	
T	lymphocyte	activation	(BANK1,	BLK,	CD247,	STAT4,	IL2RA,	CCR6,	
IDO1,	TNFSF4/OX40L,	PTPN22,	and	TNIP1).	In	addition,	candidate	
gene	studies	and	GWAS	identified	a	strong	and	consistent	association	
with	 HLA	 class	 II	 haplotypes	 on	 chromosome	 6,	 including	 HLA-
DRB1*11:04,	DQA1*05:01,	and	DQB1*03:01,	and	the	non-HLA	histo-
compatibility	 complex	 (MHC)	 genes	 NOTCH4	 and	 PSORSC1.	 Other	
genetic	variants	associated	with	SSc	are	involved	in	innate	immunity	
and	 type	 1	 interferon	 signaling	 (IRF5,	 IRF7,	 STAT4,	 TNFAIP3,	 and

extracellular	 matrix–related	 genes	 CSK,	 CAV1,	 PPARG,	 and	 GRB10	
have	 been	 reported.	 In	 addition	 to	 SSc	 susceptibility,	 some	 of	 these	
genetic	 loci	 are	 associated	 with	 particular	 disease	 manifestations	 or	
serologic	subsets,	including	ILD	(CTGF,	CD226),	PAH	(TNIP1),	scle-
roderma	 renal	 crisis	 (HLA-DRB1*),	 and	 anticentromere	 antibodies	
(HLA-DPB1*05:01).	While	the	functional	consequences	of	these	gene	
variants	and	their	potential	roles	in	pathogenesis	are	not	well	under-
stood,	it	seems	likely	that	in	combination	they	cause	a	state	of	altered	
immune	regulation,	leading	to	increased	susceptibility	to	autoimmu-
nity	and	persistent	inflammation.	Of	note,	several	of	the	SSc	genetic	
variants	are	also	implicated	in	other	autoimmune	disorders,	including	
SLE,	Sjögren’s	syndrome,	rheumatoid	arthritis,	multiple	sclerosis,	and	
psoriasis,	 suggesting	 common	 pathogenic	 pathways	 shared	 among	
these	phenotypically	dissimilar	conditions.	Notably,	the	genetic	associ-
ations	identified	to	date	only	explain	a	fraction	of	the	heritability	of	SSc	
and	focus	on	common	variants.	By	contrast,	next-generation	sequenc-
ing,	 such	 as	 whole	 exome	 sequencing,	 may	 help	 identify	 additional	
genetic	susceptibility	factors	in	SSc,	particularly	rare	(and	potentially	
causal)	 coding	 variants	 and	
their	 association	 with	 specific	
phenotypes.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL 
EXPOSURES
The	 etiology	 of	 SSc	 is	 unknown.	 Given	 the	 relatively	 modest	 genetic	
contribution	 to	 susceptibility	 in	 SSc,	 environmental	 factors,	 such	 as	
infectious	agents,	microbiome,	and	occupational,	dietary,	lifestyle,	and	
drug	exposures,	are	likely	to	play	a	major	role.	Evidence	suggests	poten-
tial	 pathogenic	 roles	 for	 viruses,	 including	 parvovirus	 B19,	 Epstein-
Barr	 virus	 (EBV),	 and	 cytomegalovirus	 (CMV),	 and	 Rhodotorula 
glutinis.	 Toxic	 oil	 syndrome,	 a	 novel	 disease	 with	 features	 suggestive	
of	 SSc,	 occurred	 as	 an	 epidemic	 outbreak	 in	 Spain	 in	 the	 1980s	 and	
was	 linked	 to	 contaminated	 rapeseed	 oil	 used	 for	 cooking.	 Another	
epidemic	 outbreak,	 termed	 eosinophilia-myalgia  syndrome	 (EMS),	
occurred	in	the	United	States	in	the	1990s	and	was	linked	to	consump-
tion	 of	 L-tryptophan-containing	 dietary	 supplements.	 Exposure	 to	
gadolinium	 contrast	 material	 in	 individuals	 with	 compromised	 renal	
function	undergoing	magnetic	resonance	scanning	has	been	associated	
with	nephrogenic	systemic	fibrosis.	While	each	of	these	novel	toxic-epi-
demic	syndromes	was	characterized	by	chronic	indurative	skin	changes	

and	variable	visceral	organ	involvement,	the	constellation	of	associated	
clinical,	 pathologic,	 and	 laboratory	 features	 distinguishes	 them	 from	
SSc.	 Occupational	 exposures	 tentatively	 linked	 with	 SSc	 include	 par-
ticulate	silica	(quartz),	polyvinyl	chloride,	epoxy	resins,	welding	fumes,	
and	organic	solvents	and	aromatic	hydrocarbons	including	paint	thin-
ners,	toluene,	xylene,	and	trichloroethylene.	These	exposures	can	elicit	
cell	type–specific	stable	and	heritable	epigenetic	modifications	such	as	
DNA	 methylation	 and	 histone	 modification	 that	 could	 drive	 patho-
genic	alterations	in	cellular	gene	expression.	Several	of	these	epigenetic	
modifications	are	reversible	and	represent	potential	targets	for	therapy.	
Drugs	implicated	in	SSc-like	illnesses	include	bleomycin,	pentazocine,	
cocaine,	 and	 appetite	 suppressants	 linked	 with	 PAH.	 Most	 recently,	
immune	 checkpoint	 inhibitors	 such	 as	 PD-1	 blockers	 used	 in	 cancer	
therapy	have	been	implicated	as	triggers	for	SSc-like	illnesses.	Radia-
tion	therapy	for	cancer	has	been	linked	with	de	novo	onset	of	SSc	as	
well	as	with	exacerbation	of	preexisting	SSc.	In	contrast	to	rheumatoid	
arthritis,	cigarette	smoking	does	not	increase	the	risk	of	SSc.	Although	
case	reports	and	series	describing	the	occurrence	of	SSc	in	women	with	
silicone	breast	implants	had	raised	concern	regarding	a	putative	patho-
genic	 role	 of	 silicone	 in	 SSc,	 large-scale	 epidemiologic	 investigations	
found	no	evidence	of	increased	prevalence	of	SSc.

PATHOGENESIS
The	 pathogenesis	 of	 SSc	 involves	 putative	 environmental	 insults	 that	
trigger	 epigenetic	 modifications	 in	 a	 genetically	 predisposed	 host,	
causing	alterations	in	gene	expression	underlying	durable	changes	in	
the	behavior	of	multiple	cell	types	(Fig. 360-2).

Three	 cardinal	 pathomechanistic	 processes	 underlie	 the	 protean	
clinical	 manifestations	 and	 pathologic	 changes	 of	 SSc:	 (1)	 diffuse	
microangiopathy,	(2)	inflammation	and	autoimmunity,	and	(3)	visceral	
and	vascular	fibrosis	affecting	multiple	organs	(Fig. 360-3).	While	each	
of	these	distinct	processes	may	be	synchronously	active	in	a	given	SSc	
patient,	 their	 relative	 severity,	 progression,	 and	 contribution	 to	 the	
overall	clinical	picture	vary	among	individual	patients	and	over	time.	
In	 general,	 autoimmunity	 and	 reversible	 vascular	 reactivity	 are	 early	
features	of	SSc,	whereas	fibrosis	and	atrophy	occur	later	in	the	disease.

 ■ ANIMAL MODELS OF DISEASE
There	 is	 no	 single	 animal	 model	 of	 SSc	 that	 fully	 reproduces	 the	
three	 cardinal	 processes	 that	 underlie	 pathogenesis.	 Tight-skin	 mice	
(Tsk1/+)	 spontaneously	 develop	 skin	 (hypodermal)	 fibrosis	 due	 to	 a	
duplication	mutation	in	the	fibrillin-1	gene.	Mutant	fibrillin-1	protein	
disrupts	 extracellular	 matrix	 assembly,	 leading	 to	 aberrant	 activation	
of	the	profibrotic	transforming	growth	factor	β	(TGF-β).	In	humans,	
fibrillin-1	mutations	are	associated	with	Marfan’s	disease	and	stiff	skin	
syndrome	but	have	not	been	reported	in	SSc.	In	mice,	skin	and	lung	
fibrosis	accompanied	by	variable	vasculopathy	and	autoimmunity	can	
be	elicited	by	repeated	injection	of	bleomycin	or	angiotensin	II	or	by	
transplantation	of	HLA-mismatched	bone	marrow	or	spleen	cells.	Tar-
geted	genetic	modifications	in	mice	give	rise	to	new	disease	models	for	
investigating	the	pathogenetic	roles	of	individual	molecules,	pathways,	
and	 cell	 types.	 For	 example,	 mice	 lacking	 IRF5,	 the	 ciliary	 proteins	
SPAG17,	 tenascin-C,	 or	 peroxisome	 proliferator-activated	 receptor	
(PPAR)-γ,	or	constitutively	overexpressing	β-catenin,	Wnt10b,	sirtuin	
3,	Fra2,	PDGFRα,	or	adiponectin	are	either	resistant	or	hypersensitive	
to	experimental	scleroderma	or	spontaneously	develop	multiple-organ	
fibrosis.	These	disease	models	can	be	useful	as	experimental	tools	to	
understand	 SSc	 pathogenesis	 and	 discover	 and	 validate	 novel	 targets	
for	therapy.

 ■ MICROANGIOPATHY
In	a	progressive	model	of	disease	pathogenesis	(Fig. 360-4),	vascular	
injury	is	an	early	and	possibly	primary	pathogenic	event	that	underlies	
protean	manifestations	of	small	vessel	vasculopathy.

Prominent	microangiopathy	in	multiple	vascular	beds	is	a	hallmark	
of	 SSc	 with	 important	 clinical	 sequelae	 including	 mucocutaneous	
telangiectasia,	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon,	 ischemic	 digital	 ulcers,	 scle-
roderma	 renal	 crisis,	 myocardial	 involvement,	 and	 PAH.	 Raynaud’s	
phenomenon,	 commonly	 the	 initial	 manifestation	 of	 SSc,	 is	 char-
acterized	 by	 altered	 blood-flow	 response	 to	 cold	 challenge	 in	 small	
digital	 arteries.	 This	 reversible	 functional	 abnormality	 is	 associated	
with	autonomic	and	peripheral	nervous	system	alterations,	including	
impaired	 production	 of	 the	 neuropeptide	 calcitonin	 gene–related	
peptide	from	sensory	afferent	nerves	and	heightened	sensitivity	of	α2-	
adrenergic	receptors	on	vascular	smooth-muscle	cells.	Isolated	(primary)	
Raynaud’s	 disease	 is	 common,	 generally	 benign,	 and	 nonprogressive.	
In	 contrast,	 SSc-associated	 secondary	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 often	
progresses	to	irreversible	structural	changes	in	the	small	blood	vessels,	
culminating	in	ischemic	digital	tip	ulcers,	necrosis,	and	amputation.

Viruses,	 cytotoxic	 factors,	 chemokines,	 thrombogenic	 microparti-
cles,	alternate	complement	pathway	activation,	and	autoantibodies	tar-
geting	endothelial	cells,	phospholipids,	and	β2-glycoprotein	I	(β2GPI)	
have	all	been	implicated	as	putative	triggers	of	endothelial	cell	injury	in	
SSc.	Endothelial	damage	disrupts	the	production	of	vasodilatory	(nitric	
oxide	 and	 prostacyclin)	 and	 vasoconstricting	 (endothelin-1)	 sub-
stances,	while	causing	upregulation	of	intercellular	adhesion	molecule	

1	(ICAM-1)	and	other	surface	adhesion	molecules.	Microvessels	show	
enhanced	 permeability	 and	 transendothelial	 leukocyte	 diapedesis,	
activation	 of	 coagulation	 cascades,	 elevated	 thrombin	 production,	
and	 impaired	 fibrinolysis.	 Spontaneous	 platelet	 aggregation	 causes	
release	of	serotonin,	platelet-derived	growth	factor	(PDGF),	and	plate-
let	 alpha	 granules	 including	 thromboxane,	 a	 potent	 vasoconstrictor.	
Smooth-muscle	 cell–like	 myointimal	 cells	 accumulate	 in	 the	 media,	
potentially	arising	through	a	process	called	endothelial-mesenchymal	
transition	 (EndoMT).	 The	 basement	 membrane	 is	 thickened	 and	
reduplicated,	and	perivascular	adventitial	fibrosis	develops.	The	vascu-
lopathic	process	primarily	affects	capillaries,	arterioles,	and	less	com-
monly	even	large	vessels	in	many	organs,	resulting	in	impaired	blood	
flow	and	tissue	ischemia.	Progressive	luminal	occlusion	due	to	intimal	
and	 medial	 hypertrophy,	 combined	 with	 persistent	 endothelial	 cell	
damage	and	adventitial	fibrosis,	establish	a	vicious	cycle	that	underlies	
fibroproliferative	vasculopathy	and	culminates	in	the	striking	absence	
of	 small	 blood	 vessels	 (rarefaction)	 in	 late-stage	 disease.	 Recurrent	
ischemia-reperfusion	 generates	 reactive	 oxygen	 species	 (ROS)	 that	
further	damage	the	endothelium	through	peroxidation	of	membrane	
lipids.	 Paradoxically,	 the	 process	 of	 revascularization	 that	 normally	
reestablishes	blood	flow	to	ischemic	tissue	is	defective	in	SSc	despite	
elevated	 levels	 of	 other	 angiogenic	 factors.	 Moreover,	 bone	 marrow–
derived	circulating	endothelial	progenitor	cells	are	reduced	in	number	
and	impaired	in	function.

There	 is	 increasing	 evidence	 implicating	 EndoMT	 in	 the	 patho-
genesis	of	SSc	vasculopathy.	The	process	of	EndoMT	is	characterized	
by	 transition	 of	 endothelial	 cells	 into	 myofibroblasts	 accompanied	
by	 loss	 of	 endothelial	 cell	 markers	 and	 acquisition	 of	 myofibroblast	
markers	associated	with	nuclear	localization	of	the	transcription	factor	
Snail1.	In	arterioles	and	small	arteries,	EndoMT	leads	to	accumulation	
of	 endothelial	 cell–derived	 myofibroblasts	 in	 the	 intima	 and	 media,	
resulting	in	fibroproliferative	vasculopathy	and	luminal	occlusion.	In	
contrast,	EndoMT	affecting	the	capillary	vessels	leads	to	a	destructive	
vasculopathy	 characterized	 by	 loss	 of	 endothelial	 cells	 and	 accumu-
lation	 of	 interstitial	 myofibroblasts	 derived	 from	 endothelial	 cells,	
resulting	in	interstitial	fibrosis	and	microvessel	rarefaction,	as	can	be	
observed	 by	 nailfold	 capillaroscopy.	 Widespread	 capillary	 loss	 com-
bined	 with	 fibroproliferative	 vasculopathy	 affecting	 arterioles	 and	
arteries	and	impaired	ability	to	repair	and	replace	damaged	vessels	are	
hallmarks	of	SSc.

 ■ INFLAMMATION AND AUTOIMMUNITY
Cellular  Immunity  While	 the	 initial	 events	 triggering	 the	 acti-
vation	 of	 innate	 and	 adaptive	 autoimmunity	 in	 SSc	 are	 unknown,	 a	
number	of	observations	support	the	inflammatory/autoimmune	nature	
of	 SSc:	 near-universal	 presence	 of	 circulating	 autoantibodies	 with	
defined	specificities;	clustering	of	SSc	with	other	autoimmune	diseases;	
activated	immune	cells,	including	autoreactive	T	cells	with	oligoclonal	
antigen	 receptors,	 within	 target	 organs;	 prominent	 type	 I	 interferon	
(IFN)	 signatures,	 characterized	 by	 elevated	 expression	 of	 IFN-regulated	
genes,	 in	 a	 variety	 of	 immune	 cell	 types	 in	 circulation	 and	 in	 skin	
biopsies;	 elevated	 circulating	 levels	 and	 spontaneous	 mononuclear	
cell	secretion	of	cytokines	and	chemokines	such	as	interleukin	(IL)	6,	
tumor	 necrosis	 factor,	 IL-4,	 IL-10,	 IL-17,	 IL-33,	 CCL2,	 and	 CXCL4;	
genetic	 association	 of	 SSc	 (shared	 with	 other	 autoimmune	 diseases)	
with	 variants	 of	 MHC	 and	 other	 immune	 response	 genes;	 and	 the	
rapid	 clinical	 response,	 fibrosis	 resolution,	 and	 vascular	 regeneration	
observed	 in	 some	 SSc	 patients	 treated	 with	 immunomodulatory	 or	
immunoablative	therapies.

Circulating	monocytes	from	SSc	patients	overexpress	IFN-regulated	
genes	such	as	Siglec-1,	have	reduced	levels	of	caveolin-1,	and	exhibit	
a	profibrotic	phenotype.	In	early	(edematous)	stage	SSc,	mononuclear	
cell	infiltrates	composed	of	activated	T	cells,	monocytes/macrophages,	
and	dendritic	cells	can	be	detected	in	skin,	lungs,	and	other	affected	
organs	 even	 prior	 to	 fibrosis	 or	 vascular	 damage.	 Dendritic	 cells	 in	
close	 proximity	 to	 activated	 fibroblasts	 and	 myofibroblasts	 express	
toll-like	 receptors	 (TLRs)	 that	 are	 activated	 by	 self-nucleic	 acids	 and	
other	 endogenous	 ligands.	 TLR	 stimulation	 induces	 the	 secretion

FIGURE 360-4  Integrated progressive model of systemic sclerosis (SSc) pathogenesis. Initial vascular insult in a genetically predisposed individual triggers a cascade 
of functional and structural vascular alterations associated with inflammation and autoimmunity. Early immune responses elicit fibroblast activation and differentiation, 
resulting  in  sustained  pathologic  fibrogenesis,  irreversible  tissue  damage,  and  failure  of  affected  organs.  Vascular  damage  also  leads  to  tissue  ischemia  that  further

of	 mediators	 including	 IFN,	 IL-10,	 thymic	 stromal	 lymphopoietin	
(TSLP),	and	CXCL4,	shaping	the	adaptive	immune	response	and	con-
tributing	to	loss	of	immune	tolerance.	Tissue-infiltrating	T	cells	express	
CD45	 and	 HLA-DR	 activation	 markers	 and	 display	 restricted	 T-cell	
receptor	signatures	indicative	of	oligoclonal	expansion	in	response	to	
recognition	of	as-yet-unknown	antigen.	Of	note,	in	patients	diagnosed	
with	SSc	in	close	temporal	association	with	cancer	who	are	positive	for	
RNA	 polymerase	 III	 antibody,	 the	 tumor	 commonly	 harbors	 genetic	
alterations	 in	 RNApol3,	 which	 results	 in	 the	 generation	 of	 autoanti-
gen-specific	T-cell	immunity	and	cross-reactive	antibodies.

Circulating	T	cells	in	SSc	express	chemokine	receptors	and	α1	inte-
grin,	 accounting	 for	 their	 enhanced	 binding	 to	 endothelium	 and	 to	
fibroblasts,	while	endothelial	cells	express	ICAM-1	and	other	adhesion	
molecules	 that	 facilitate	 leukocyte	 diapedesis.	 Activated	 T	 cells	 show	
a	TH2-polarized	immune	response	driven	by	dendritic	cells.	The	TH2	
cytokines	 IL-4,	 IL-13,	 IL-33,	 and	 TSLP	 induce	 fibroblast	 activation,	
whereas	 the	 TH1	 cytokine	 interferon	 γ	 (IFN-γ)	 blocks	 cytokine-
mediated	fibroblast	activation	and	exhibits	antifibrotic	properties.	Evi-
dence	for	altered	TH17	and	regulatory	T-cell	function	in	SSc	has	been	
reported.	 Type	 2	 innate	 lymphoid	 cells	 (iLCs),	 a	 recently	 discovered	
distinct	lymphoid	cell	population	implicated	in	type	2	immunity	and	

tissue	 remodeling,	 are	 also	 elevated	 in	 SSc	 skin	 biopsies.	 Alternately	
activated	macrophages	expressing	CD163,	which	produce	TGF-β	and	
promote	angiogenesis	and	tissue	remodeling,	are	increased	in	the	skin	
and	lung	in	SSc.	Regulatory	T	cells	(Tregs)	enforce	immune	tolerance,	
and	although	their	frequency	is	elevated	in	the	circulation	and	tissues	
in	SSc	patients,	their	immunosuppressive	function	appears	to	be	defec-
tive.	 A	 recent	 report	 demonstrated	 that	 Tregs	 play	 a	 critical	 role	 in	
preventing	 spontaneous	 fibrosis	 in	 the	 skin,	 possibly	 by	 sequestering	
activated	 TGF-β.	 Some	 evidence	 implicates	 altered	 B-cell	 homeosta-

B-cell	activating	factor	(BAFF),	members	of	the	TNF	superfamily	with

early	 and	 possibly	 preclinical	 stages	 of	 disease.	 In	 addition,	 several	
SSc-specific	 autoantibodies	 with	 distinct	 patterns	 of	 immunofluores-
cence	show	strong	associations	with	unique	disease	phenotypes	as	well	
as	 HLA	 haplotype	 (Table  360-4).	 Owing	 to	 their	 specificity,	 mutual	
exclusivity,	 and	 association	 with	 unique	 disease	 manifestations,	 SSc-	
associated	autoantibodies	have	substantial	utility	in	clinical	practice	for	
diagnosis	and	risk	stratification,	while	their	role	in	monitoring	disease	
activity	or	response	to	therapy	remains	uncertain.	Recently,	antibodies	
directed	 against	 fibrillin-1,	 matrix	 metalloproteinases,	 cell	 surface	
markers,	angiotensin	II	receptor,	endothelin-1	receptor,	or	the	PDGF	
receptor	have	been	identified	in	patients	with	SSc,	although	their	clin-
ical	relevance	is	not	yet	established.	These	antibodies	have	functional	
receptor	agonist	activity	and	might	have	direct	pathogenic	roles.

A	 variety	 of	 mechanisms	 have	 been	 proposed	 to	 account	 for	 the	
generation	 of	 SSc-associated	 autoantibodies.	 Proteolytic	 cleavage,	
increased	expression	or	altered	subcellular	localization	of	normal	pro-
teins,	or	their	alterations	due	to	mutation	in	the	case	of	certain	tumors	
could	lead	to	their	immune	recognition	as	neoepitopes,	resulting	in	a	
break	of	immune	tolerance.
 ■ FIBROSIS
Fibrosis	 synchronously	 affecting	 multiple	 organs	 is	 a	 distinguishing	
feature	 of	 SSc.	 The	 process	 is	 characterized	 by	 replacement	 of	 nor-
mal	 tissue	 architecture	 with	 rigid,	 avascular,	 and	 relatively	 acellular	
connective	 tissue.	 Fibrosis	 in	 SSc	 follows,	 and	 is	 a	 consequence	 of,	
inflammation	and	microvascular	damage	(Fig.	360-4).	Fibroblasts	are	
mesenchymal	cells	primarily	responsible	for	the	functional	and	struc-
tural	integrity	of	connective	tissue.	Upon	their	activation	by	extracel-
lular	cues,	fibroblasts	proliferate;	migrate;	secrete	collagens	and	other	
matrix	 molecules,	 growth	 factors,	 chemokines,	 and	 cytokines;	 and	
transdifferentiate	into	contractile	myofibroblasts.	Under	normal	con-
ditions,	these	are	responses	self-limited	to	accomplish	tissue	regulated	
repair	 and	 regeneration.	 In	 contrast,	 when	 these	 responses	 become	

sustained	and	amplified,	pathologic	fibrosis	results.	A	panoply	of	stim-
ulatory	signals	are	potentially	implicated	in	SSc	pathogenesis.	In	addi-
tion	 to	 TGF-β,	 these	 include	 paracrine	 mediators	 IL-6,	 IL-11,	 IL-13,	
and	 IL-23,	 morphogens	 and	 Wnt	 ligands,	 connective	 tissue	 growth	
factor	 (CTGF),	 PDGF,	 lysophosphatidic	 acid,	 endothelin-1,	 hypoxia,	
ROS,	thrombin,	and	mechanical	forces;	these	signals	might	contribute	
to	sustained	fibroblast	activation	underlying	maladaptive	repair	in	SSc.	
Buildup	 of	 damage-associated	 endogenous	 ligands	 for	 TLR4	 (EDA-
fibronectin	 and	 tenascin-C)	 and	 TLR9	 (mitochondrial	 DNA)	 within	
the	microenvironment	further	contributes	to	nonresolving	fibrosis	via	
unchecked	TLR	activation	and	innate	immune	signaling.

In	 addition	 to	 tissue-resident	 fibroblasts	 and	 transformed	 myofi-
broblasts,	bone	marrow–derived	circulating	mesenchymal	progenitor	
cells	 also	 contribute	 to	 fibrosis.	 The	 factors	 that	 regulate	 the	 differ-
entiation	 of	 mesenchymal	 progenitor	 cells	 and	 their	 trafficking	 from	
the	 circulation	 into	 lesional	 tissue	 are	 unknown.	 Endothelial	 cells	 in	
injured	 arterioles	 and	 small	 arteries	 undergo	 EndoMT,	 giving	 rise	 to	
myofibroblasts	that	drive	perivascular	fibrosis.	Epithelial	cells,	pread-
ipocytes,	 and	 tissue	 fibroblasts	 are	 all	 putative	 sources	 of	 pathogenic	
myofibroblasts.	Although	myofibroblasts	are	transiently	found	in	nor-
mal	wound	healing,	their	persistence	in	fibrotic	tissue,	possibly	due	to	
their	ability	to	evade	apoptosis,	contributes	to	scar	formation.

Explanted	SSc	fibroblasts	display	an	abnormally	activated	phenotype	
ex	vivo,	characterized	by	increased	collagen	production,	spontaneous	
ROS	 generation,	 prominent	 stress	 fibers,	 and	 constitutive	 expression	
of	alpha	smooth-muscle	actin.	Persistence	of	the	“scleroderma	pheno-
type”	during	serial	ex	vivo	passage	of	SSc	fibroblasts	may	reflect	auto-
crine	 TGF-β	 stimulatory	 loops,	 deregulated	 microRNA	 expressions,	
cell-autonomous	 metabolic	 changes,	 or	 stable	 acquired	 epigenetic	
modifications.	More	recently,	tools	such	as	single-cell	RNA	sequencing	
have	revealed	functional	heterogeneity	among	fibrotic	fibroblasts.

PATHOLOGY
While	pathologic	findings	vary	across	anatomic	sites,	the	distinguish-
ing	hallmarks	of	SSc	irrespective	of	the	organ	system	are	widespread	
microangiopathy	 (fibroproliferative	 vasculopathy),	 capillary	 loss	 and	
obliteration,	 and	 fibrosis.	 In	 early-stage	 disease,	 perivascular	 inflam-
matory	 cell	 infiltrates	 composed	 of	 T	 and	 B	 lymphocytes,	 activated	
monocytes	 and	 macrophages,	 and	 mast	 cells	 may	 be	 detected	 in	
multiple	organs.	A	noninflammatory	obliterative	microangiopathy	in	
the	heart,	lungs,	kidneys,	and	gastrointestinal	tract	is	a	prominent	late	
finding.	Fibrosis	most	prominently	affects	the	skin,	lungs,	cardiovascu-
lar	system,	gastrointestinal	tract,	tendon	sheaths,	perifascicular	tissue	
surrounding	skeletal	muscle,	and	some	endocrine	organs	such	as	the	
thyroid	gland.	Excessive	accumulation	of	collagens	and	other	structural	
matrix	 macromolecules	 progressively	 disrupts	 normal	 architecture,	
resulting	in	impaired	function	and	failure	of	affected	organs.

 ■ SKIN
In	 the	 skin,	 the	 dermis	 is	 thickened	 due	 to	 accumulation	 of	 broad	
bundles	 of	 homogenized	 collagen	 oriented	 parallel	 to	 the	 epithelium	
(Fig.  360-5A).	 Adnexal	 glands	 are	 atrophic,	 and	 loss	 of	 periadnexal	
and	intradermal	white	adipose	tissue	and	its	replacement	with	collagen	
can	 be	 striking.	 While	 perivascular	 mononuclear	 cell	 infiltrates	 may	
be	seen	early,	established	skin	fibrosis	shows	absence	of	inflammation.

 ■ LUNGS
Autopsy	 studies	 universally	 show	 evidence	 of	 lung	 involvement	 in	
both	 limited	 and	 diffuse	 cutaneous	 subsets	 of	 SSc.	 Most	 common	 is	
the	 nonspecific	 interstitial	 pneumonia	 (NSIP)	 pattern	 characterized	
variable	interstitial	fibrosis	and	mild	chronic	inflammation	with	T	lym-
phocytes,	macrophages,	and	eosinophils.	With	progression,	interstitial	
fibrosis	 and	 vascular	 damage	 dominate,	 often	 coexisting	 within	 the	
same	biopsy.	The	usual	interstitial	pneumonia	(UIP)	pattern	of	spatial	
and	temporal	heterogeneity	of	inflammation	and	fibrosis	and	fibrotic	
foci,	a	hallmark	of	idiopathic	pulmonary	fibrosis,	is	less	common	in	SSc	
(Fig. 360-5B).	Fibrosis	of	the	alveolar	septae	results	in	obliteration	of	
the	airspaces	and	loss	of	pulmonary	blood	vessels.	This	process	impairs	
gas	 exchange	 and	 contributes	 to	 pulmonary	 hypertension.	 Intimal

 ■ GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
Pathologic	 changes	 can	 be	 found	 at	 any	 level	 from	 the	 mouth	 to	 the	
rectum.	 Atrophy	 and	 fibrosis	 of	 the	 muscularis	 propria	 and	 charac-
teristic	 vascular	 lesions	 are	 prominent	 in	 the	 lower	 esophagus,	 while	
striated	muscle	in	the	upper	third	of	the	esophagus	is	generally	spared.	
Collagenous	 replacement	 of	 the	 intestinal	 tract	 architecture	 results	
in	 impaired	 smooth-muscle	 contractility	 and	 diminished	 peristaltic	
activity,	underlying	gut	dysmotility,	bacterial	overgrowth,	small-bowel	
pseudo-obstruction,	and	perforation.	Chronic	gastroesophageal	reflux	
is	 associated	 with	 esophageal	 inflammation,	 mucosal	 ulceration,	 and	
stricture	formation	and	may	lead	to	Barrett’s	metaplasia	with	attendant	
risk	of	adenocarcinoma.	Esophageal	dilatation	and	reflux	may	aggra-
vate	ILD	due	to	chronic	microaspiration.

 ■ KIDNEYS
In	 the	 kidneys,	 vascular	 lesions	 affecting	 the	 interlobular	 and	
arcuate	 arteries	 predominate.	 Chronic	 renal	 ischemia	 is	 associated	
with	 shrunken	 glomeruli.	 Patients	 with	 scleroderma	 renal	 crisis,	 a	
life-threatening	acute	complication	of	SSc,	show	acute	fibrinoid	necro-
sis	of	afferent	arterioles,	followed	by	intimal	proliferation	(onion-skin	
pattern)	 and	 ischemic	 collapse	 of	 glomeruli.	 These	 changes	 are	 rem-
iniscent	 of	 thrombotic	 microangiopathies	 such	 as	 atypical	 hemolyt-
ic-uremic	syndrome	(Chap. 115)	and	are	accompanied	by	thrombosis,	
thrombocytopenia	 due	 to	 platelet	 consumption,	 and	 intravascular	
hemolysis.	Evidence	of	complement	activation	may	be	seen	in	kidney	
biopsies.	Extensive	vascular	thrombosis,	glomerular	collapse,	and	per-
itubular	capillary	deposits	predict	irreversible	renal	failure.

 ■ HEART
Subclinical	 cardiac	 pathology	 is	 common	 in	 SSc	 and	 may	 affect	 the	
myocardium	 and	 pericardium.	 The	 characteristic	 arteriolar	 lesions	
in	 the	 heart	 are	 concentric	 intimal	 hypertrophy	 and	 luminal	 nar-
rowing,	 patchy	 contraction	 band	 necrosis,	 loss	 of	 cardiac	 myo-
cytes,	 and	 myocardial	 fibrosis	 due	 to	 microvascular	 involvement	
and	 ischemia-reperfusion	 injury.	 Fibrosis	 of	 the	 conduction	 system	
is	 also	 common,	 especially	 at	 the	 sinoatrial	 node.	 The	 frequency	 of	
epicardial	 atherosclerotic	 coronary	 artery	 disease	 may	 be	 increased	
in	SSc	compared	to	the	general	population,	similar	to	other	systemic	
inflammatory	 diseases.	 Pericardial	 involvement	 with	 chronic	 inflam-
matory	infiltrates	and	fibrinous	exudates	is	common	and	is	sometimes	
associated	with	pericardial	effusions.

 ■ PATHOLOGY IN OTHER ORGANS
Synovitis	of	the	hands	may	occur	in	SSc;	with	disease	progression,	the	
synovium	 becomes	 fibrotic,	 and	 in	 contrast	 to	 rheumatoid	 disease,	
pannus	 formation	 and	 bone	 resorption	 are	 uncommon.	 Fibrosis	 of	
tendon	 sheaths	 and	 fascia,	 sometimes	 accompanied	 by	 calcifica-
tions,	produces	palpable	and	sometimes	audible	tendon	friction	rubs.	
Inflammation	 and,	 in	 later	 stages,	 atrophy	 and	 fibrosis	 of	 skeletal	
muscles	are	common	findings	and	are	similar	to	those	in	polymyositis.	
Fibrosis	of	the	thyroid	and	of	the	minor	salivary	glands	may	be	seen	
and	underlie	hypothyroidism	and	the	sicca	syndrome.	Placentas	from	
SSc	pregnancies	show	decidual	vasculopathy,	which	is	associated	with	
poor	perinatal	outcomes	and	fetal	death.

CLINICAL FEATURES
 ■ OVERVIEW
SSc	 is	 truly	 a	 systemic	 disease	 that	 can	 affect	 virtually	 any	 organ		
(Fig.	 360-1	 and	 Table  360-5).	 Although	 a	 dichotomous	 stratification	
into	diffuse	and	limited	cutaneous	subsets	(Table	360-2)	is	useful,	SSc	
is	far	more	complex,	and	multiple	distinct	clusters	or	endophenotypes	
of	 SSc	 with	 characteristic	 manifestations	 and	 trajectories	 and	 out-
comes	can	be	recognized	within	each	subset.	Unique	endophenotypes	
associate	 with	 autoantibodies	 with	 distinct	 and	 mutually	 exclusive	
specificities	(Table	360-4).	Moreover,	patients	with	“overlap”	have	typ-
ical	features	of	SSc	coexisting	with	clinical	and	laboratory	evidence	of	
another	autoimmune	disease,	most	commonly	polymyositis,	Sjögren’s	
syndrome,	polyarthritis,	autoimmune	liver	disease,	or	SLE.

 ■ INITIAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Characteristic	initial	presentation	is	quite	different	in	patients	with	the	
diffuse	(dcSSc)	versus	limited	(lcSSc)	cutaneous	forms	of	the	disease.	
In	 dcSSc,	 the	 interval	 between	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 and	 onset	
of	 other	 disease	 manifestations	 is	 typically	 brief	 (weeks	 to	 months).	
Soft	 tissue	 swelling,	 puffy	 fingers,	 and	 pruritus	 are	 signs	 of	 the	 early	
inflammatory	 “edematous”	 phase.	 The	 fingers,	 distal	 limbs,	 and	 face	
are	usually	affected	first.	Diffuse	hyperpigmentation	of	the	skin,	carpal	
tunnel	syndrome,	arthralgias,	muscle	weakness,	fatigue,	and	decreased	
joint	mobility	are	common.	During	the	ensuing	weeks	to	months,	the	
inflammatory	edematous	phase	evolves	into	the	“fibrotic”	phase,	with	
skin	induration	associated	with	hair	loss,	reduced	production	of	skin	
oils,	and	decline	in	sweating	capacity.	Progressive	flexion	contractures	
of	the	fingers	ensue.	The	wrists,	elbows,	knees,	and	ankles	become	stiff	
due	to	fibrosis	of	the	supporting	joint	structures.	While	advancing	skin	
involvement	 is	 the	 most	 visible	 manifestation	 of	 early	 dcSSc,	 impor-
tant	and	clinically	silent	internal	organ	involvement	can	occur	during	
this	stage.	The	initial	4	years	from	disease	onset	is	the	period	of	most	
rapidly	evolving	and	potentially	irreversible	lung	and	renal	damage.	If	
organ	failure	does	not	occur	during	this	phase	of	dcSSc,	the	systemic	
process	may	plateau	and	stabilize.

Compared	to	dcSSc,	the	course	of	lcSSc	tends	to	be	more	indolent.	
The	 interval	 between	 onset	 of	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 and	 disease	
manifestations	such	as	gastroesophageal	reflux	disease	(GERD),	cuta-
neous	telangiectasia,	ischemic	digital	ulcers,	or	soft	tissue	calcifications	
can	be	as	long	as	years.	Scleroderma	renal	crisis,	significant	ILD,	and	
tendon	friction	rubs	occur	rarely	in	lcSSc,	whereas	PAH	and	overlap	
with	keratoconjunctivitis	sicca,	polyarthritis,	cutaneous	vasculitis,	and	
biliary	cirrhosis	can	develop	even	many	years	after	disease	onset.

ORGAN INVOLVEMENT
 ■ RAYNAUD’S PHENOMENON
Raynaud’s	 phenomenon,	 the	 most	 frequent	 extracutaneous	 compli-
cation	 of	 SSc,	 is	 characterized	 by	 episodic	 vasoconstriction	 in	 the	
fingers	 and	 toes,	 sometimes	 also	 affecting	 the	 tip	 of	 the	 nose	 and	
earlobes.	Attacks	are	reversible,	and	can	be	triggered	by	a	decrease	in	
temperature,	 as	 well	 as	 emotional	 stress	 and	 vibration.	 Attacks	 typi-
cally	start	with	pallor	of	the	fingers,	followed	by	cyanosis	of	variable	
duration.	Hyperemia	ensues	spontaneously	or	with	rewarming	of	the	
digit.	The	progression	of	the	three	color	phases	reflects	the	underlying	
vasoconstriction,	 ischemia,	 and	 reperfusion.	 It	 is	 important	 to	 note	
that	up	to	5%	of	the	general	population	has	Raynaud’s	phenomenon.	
In	 the	 absence	 of	 signs	 or	 symptoms	 of	 an	 underlying	 condition,	
Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 is	 classified	 as	 primary	 (Raynaud’s	 disease),	
which	 represents	 an	 exaggerated	 physiologic	 vasomotor	 response	
to	 cold.	 Secondary	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 occurs	 in	 SSc	 and	 other	
connective	tissue	diseases,	hematologic	and	endocrine	conditions,	and	

FIGURE  360-6  Digital  necrosis.  Sharply  demarcated  necrosis  of  the  fingertip

associated with severe Raynaud’s phenomenon.

occupational	disorders,	and	can	complicate	treatment	with	beta	block-
ers	and	anticancer	drugs	such	as	cisplatin	and	bleomycin.	Distinguish-
ing	primary	Raynaud’s	disease	from	secondary	Raynaud’s	phenomenon	
can	present	a	diagnostic	challenge.	Raynaud’s	disease	is	supported	by	
the	following:	absence	of	an	underlying	cause;	a	family	history	of	Ray-
naud’s	 phenomenon;	 absence	 of	 digital	 tissue	 necrosis	 or	 ulceration;	
and	a	negative	ANA	test.	Secondary	Raynaud’s	phenomenon	tends	to	
occur	at	an	older	age,	is	more	severe	(episodes	are	more	frequent,	pro-
longed,	and	painful),	and	is	frequently	complicated	by	ischemic	digital	
ulcers	and	loss	of	digits	(Fig. 360-6).

Nailfold	capillaroscopy	using	a	low-power	stereoscopic	microscope	
or	 ophthalmoscope	 permits	 visualization	 of	 nailbed	 cutaneous	 capil-
laries	 under	 immersion	 oil	 (Fig.  360-7).	 Raynaud’s	 disease	 is	 associ-
ated	with	evenly	spaced	parallel	vascular	loops,	whereas	in	secondary	
Raynaud’s	phenomenon,	nailfold	capillaries	are	distorted	with	widened	
and	 irregular	 loops,	 dilated	 lumen,	 microhemorrhages,	 and	 areas	 of	
vascular	 “dropout.”	 Thus,	 nailfold	 capillaroscopy	 can	 be	 helpful	 for	
both	differentiating	primary	from	secondary	Raynaud’s	phenomenon	
and	for	establishing	the	early	diagnosis	of	SSc.

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disorders ■ SKIN FEATURES
Bilateral	symmetrical	skin	thickening	is	the	hallmark	that	distinguishes	
SSc	from	other	connective	tissue	diseases.	Skin	involvement	starts	in	
the	 fingers	 and	 characteristically	 advances	 from	 distal	 to	 proximal	
extremities	 in	 an	 ascending	 fashion.	 Some	 patients	 note	 diffuse	 tan-
ning	in	the	absence	of	sun	exposure	as	a	very	early	manifestation.	In	
dark-skinned	 individuals,	 vitiligo-like	 hypopigmentation	 may	 occur.	
Pigment	loss	sparing	the	perifollicular	areas	gives	rise	to	a	“salt-and-
pepper”	appearance	of	the	skin,	most	prominently	on	the	scalp,	upper	
back,	 and	 chest.	 Dermal	 sclerosis	 obliterating	 hair	 follicles,	 sweat	
glands,	 and	 eccrine	 and	 sebaceous	 glands	 causes	 hair	 loss,	 decreased	
sweating,	and	xerosis	and	itching	in	affected	areas	of	the	skin.	Trans-
verse	creases	on	the	dorsum	of	the	fingers	disappear	(Fig. 360-8).	Fixed	
flexion	 contractures	 of	 the	 fingers	 cause	 reduced	 hand	 mobility	 and	
lead	to	muscle	atrophy.	Skin	and	subjacent	tendon	fibrosis	accounts	for	
fixed	contractures	of	the	wrists,	elbows,	and	knees.	Thick	ridges	at	the	
neck	due	to	firm	adherence	of	skin	to	the	underlying	platysma	muscle	
interfere	with	neck	extension.

Patients	with	established	SSc	may	show	a	characteristic	“mauskopf ”	
facial	appearance	with	taut	and	shiny	skin,	loss	of	wrinkles,	and	occa-
sionally	an	expressionless	facies	due	to	reduced	mobility	of	the	eyelids,	
cheeks,	and	mouth.	Thinning	of	the	lips	with	accentuation	of	the	cen-
tral	 incisor	 teeth	 and	 prominent	 perioral	 radial	 furrowing	 (rhytides)	
complete	the	picture.	Reduced	oral	aperture	(microstomia)	interferes	
with	eating	and	oral	hygiene.	The	nose	assumes	a	pinched,	beak-like	
appearance.	In	late-stage	disease,	the	skin	becomes	thin	and	atrophic	
and	is	firmly	bound	to	the	subcutaneous	fat	(tethering).	Dilated	skin	
capillaries	2–20	mm	in	diameter	(telangiectasia),	reminiscent	of	hered-
itary	hemorrhagic	telangiectasia,	are	frequently	on	the	face,	hands,	lips,	
and	oral	mucosa	(Fig. 360-9).	The	number	of	telangiectasias	correlates	
with	the	severity	of	microvascular	disease,	including	PAH.	Breakdown	
of	 atrophic	 skin	 leads	 to	 chronic	 ulcerations	 at	 the	 extensor	 surfaces	
of	the	proximal	interphalangeal	joints,	the	volar	pads	of	the	fingertips,	
and	bony	prominences	such	as	elbows	and	malleoli.	Ulcers	are	often	
painful,	 heal	 slowly,	 and	 become	 secondarily	 infected,	 resulting	 in	
osteomyelitis.	 Healing	 of	 ischemic	 fingertip	 ulcerations	 leaves	 char-
acteristic	fixed	digital	“pits.”	Loss	of	soft	tissue	at	the	fingertips	due	to	
ischemia	 may	 be	 associated	 with	 striking	 resorption	 of	 the	 terminal	
phalanges	(acro-osteolysis)	(Fig. 360-10).

Dystrophic	 calcifications	 in	 the	 skin,	 subcutaneous,	 and	 soft	 tis-
sues	 (calcinosis	 cutis)	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 normal	 serum	 calcium	 and	
phosphate	 levels	 occur	 in	 up	 to	 40%	 of	 patients,	 most	 commonly	 in	
those	 with	 long-standing	 anti-centromere	 antibody–positive	 lcSSc.	
Calcific	 deposits,	 composed	 of	 calcium	 hydroxyapatite	 crystals,	 vary	
in	 size	 from	 tiny	 punctate	 lesions	 to	 large	 conglomerate	 masses,	 and	
can	 be	 readily	 visualized	 on	 plain	 radiographs	 or	 dual-energy	 CT.	
These	deposits	occur	when	calcium	precipitates	in	tissue	damaged	by

skin	 involvement,	 severe	 gastroesophageal	 reflux,	 and	 presence	 of	
topoisomerase-I	 (Scl-70)	 autoantibodies,	 whereas	 anti-centromere	
antibody–positive	patients	have	a	reduced	risk	of	ILD.	Additional	risk	
factors	 for	 significant	 ILD	 include	 low	 forced	 vital	 capacity	 (FVC)	
or	 single-breath	 diffusing	 capacity	 of	 the	 lung	 for	 carbon	 monoxide	
(DLCO)	at	initial	presentation.	Esophageal	dilatation	with	chronic	acid	
reflux	 in	 SSc	 causes	 recurrent	 micro-aspiration,	 a	 risk	 factor	 for	 the	
development	 and	 progression	 of	 ILD.	 The	 most	 rapid	 progression	 in	
ILD	generally	occurs	early	in	the	disease	course	(within	the	first	3–5	
years),	 when	 the	 FVC	 can	 decline	 by	 30%	 per	 year.	 In	 contrast,	 new	
onset	of	ILD	is	rare	in	SSc	patients	with	long-standing	disease.

Pulmonary	 involvement	 can	 remain	 asymptomatic	 until	 it	 is	
advanced.	 The	 most	 common	 presenting	 respiratory	 symptoms—	
exertional	dyspnea,	fatigue,	and	reduced	exercise	tolerance—are	subtle	
and	slowly	progressive.	A	chronic	dry	cough	may	be	present.	Physical	
examination	may	reveal	fine	inspiratory	“Velcro”	crackles	at	the	lung	
bases.	 Pulmonary	 function	 testing	 (PFT)	 is	 relatively	 insensitive	 for	
detecting	 early	 pulmonary	 involvement.	 In	 patients	 with	 established	
SSc-ILD,	 PFT	 typically	 shows	 a	 restrictive	 ventilatory	 defect	 (FVC	
<70%	 predicted	 and/or	 forced	 expiratory	 volume	 in	 1	 s	 [FEV1]/FVC	
ratio	>0.8)	and	reduced	total	lung	capacity	(TLC)	and	diffusing	capac-
ity	(DLCO).	A	reduction	in	DLCO	that	is	significantly	out	of	proportion	
to	the	reduction	in	lung	volumes	should	raise	suspicion	for	pulmonary	
vascular	disease	but	may	also	be	due	to	anemia.	Oxygen	desaturation	
with	exercise	is	common.

Chest	 radiography	 can	 be	 used	 as	 an	 initial	 screening	 tool	 to	 rule	
out	 infection	 and	 other	 causes	 of	 respiratory	 symptoms	 in	 SSc,	 but	
compared	to	HRCT,	it	is	relatively	insensitive	for	detection	of	early	ILD.	
Characteristic	imaging	findings	include	lower	lobe	subpleural	reticular	
linear	opacities	and	ground-glass	opacifications	with	an	apicobasal	gra-
dient,	even	in	asymptomatic	patients	with	normal	PFTs	(Fig. 360-12).		
Additional	 HRCT	 findings	 include	 mediastinal	 lymphadenopathy,	
pulmonary	 nodules,	 traction	 bronchiectasis,	 and	 uncommonly,	 hon-
eycomb	changes.	The	extent	of	interstitial	changes	on	chest	HRCT	at	
baseline	is	a	predictor	of	ILD	progression	and	mortality.	While	bron-
choalveolar	 lavage	 (BAL)	 can	 demonstrate	 inflammatory	 cells	 in	 the	
lower	 respiratory	 tract	 and	 may	 be	 useful	 for	 ruling	 out	 tuberculosis	
and	other	infections,	it	does	not	appear	to	be	useful	for	SSc	diagnosis	
or	 for	 identifying	 reversible	 alveolitis.	 Surgical	 lung	 biopsy	 in	 SSc	 is

 ■ PULMONARY FEATURES
The	two	principal	forms	of	lung	involvement	in	SSc,	ILD	and	pulmo-
nary	vascular	disease,	are	frequent	and	together	account	for	a	majority	
of	SSc-related	deaths.	Survival	is	particularly	poor	in	SSc	patients	with	
concurrent	presence	of	these	two	processes.	Less	common	pulmonary	
complications	 of	 SSc	 include	 aspiration	 pneumonitis	 complicating	
chronic	gastroesophageal	reflux,	pulmonary	hemorrhage	due	to	endo-
bronchial	 telangiectasia,	 obliterative	 bronchiolitis,	 pleural	 reactions,	
restrictive	physiology	due	to	chest	wall	fibrosis,	spontaneous	pneumot-
horax,	and	drug-induced	lung	toxicity.	The	incidence	of	lung	cancer	is	
increased	in	SSc.

Interstitial  Lung  Disease  While	 evidence	 of	 ILD	 can	 be	 found	
in	 up	 to	 65%	 of	 SSc	 patients	 by	 high-resolution	 computed	 tomogra-
phy	 (HRCT),	 clinically	 significant	 ILD	 develops	 in	 16–43%;	 the	 fre-
quency	varies	depending	on	the	detection	method	used.	Risk	factors	
for	 significant	 ILD	 include	 male	 sex,	 African-American	 race,	 diffuse

indicated	only	in	patients	with	atypical	findings	on	chest	imaging.	The	
histologic	pattern	on	lung	biopsy	may	predict	the	risk	of	progression	of	
ILD,	with	the	NSIP	pattern	having	a	better	prognosis	than	UIP.

Pulmonary  Arterial  Hypertension  PAH	 results	 from	 vascular	
remodeling	 of	 small	 (<500	 μm)	 pulmonary	 arteries.	 PAH	 develops	
in	 8–12%	 of	 patients	 with	 SSc	 as	 a	 late	 complication	 and	 can	 be	 an	
isolated	abnormality	or	associated	with	ILD.	PAH	is	defined	as	a	mean	
pulmonary	 artery	 pressure	 ≥20	 mmHg	 with	 a	 pulmonary	 capillary	
wedge	 pressure	 ≤15	 mmHg	 and	 pulmonary	 vascular	 resistance	 >3	
Wood	units.	The	natural	history	of	SSc-associated	PAH	is	variable	but	
often	 follows	 a	 progressive	 course	 leading	 to	 right	 heart	 failure.	 The	
3-year	survival	of	SSc	patients	with	untreated	PAH	is	<50%.	Risk	fac-
tors	include	limited	cutaneous	disease,	older	age	at	disease	onset,	high	
numbers	 of	 cutaneous	 telangiectasia,	 and	 antibodies	 to	 centromere,	
U3-RNP	 (fibrillarin),	 and	 B23.	 Mutations	 in	 the	 BMPR2	 gene	 impli-
cated	in	idiopathic	PAH	are	not	associated	with	SSc-PAH.

In	SSc,	PAH	is	often	asymptomatic	in	early	stages.	Patients	present	
with	exertional	dyspnea	and	reduced	exercise	capacity.	With	progres-
sion,	 angina,	 near-syncope,	 and	 symptoms	 and	 signs	 of	 right-sided	
heart	 failure	 appear.	 Physical	 examination	 may	 show	 tachypnea,	 a	
loud	pulmonic	component	of	the	S2	heart	sound,	pulmonic/tricuspid	
regurgitation	murmur,	palpable	right	ventricular	heave,	elevated	jugu-
lar	venous	pressure,	and	dependent	edema.	Doppler	echocardiography	
is	 a	 noninvasive	 screening	 method	 for	 estimating	 the	 pulmonary	
arterial	 pressure.	 In	 light	 of	 the	 poor	 prognosis	 of	 untreated	 PAH	
and	 better	 therapeutic	 response	 in	 patients	 with	 early	 diagnosis,	 SSc	
patients	should	be	screened	for	PAH	at	initial	evaluation	and	annually	
thereafter.	 Estimated	 pulmonary	 artery	 systolic	 pressure	 >40	 mmHg	
at	 rest	 or	 tricuspid	 regurgitation	 jet	 velocities	 >3	 m/s	 suggest	 PAH.	
Pulmonary	function	testing	may	show	a	reduced	DLCO	in	isolation	or	
out	of	proportion	with	the	severity	of	restriction.	Because	echocardiog-
raphy	can	over-	or	underestimate	pulmonary	artery	pressures,	cardiac	
catheterization	is	required	to	confirm	the	diagnosis	of	suspected	PAH;	
assess	its	severity,	including	the	degree	of	right	heart	dysfunction;	rule	
out	 veno-occlusive	 disease	 and	 other	 cardiac	 (postcapillary)	 causes	
of	 pulmonary	 hypertension;	 and	 provide	 prognostic	 parameters.	
Distinguishing	 PAH	 in	 SSc	 patients	 from	 pulmonary	 hypertension	
secondary	to	pulmonary	fibrosis	and	hypoxia	can	be	difficult.	Serum	
levels	of	N-terminal	pro-brain	natriuretic	peptide	(NT-proBNP)	cor-
relate	with	the	presence	and	severity	of	PAH,	as	well	as	survival.	While	
NT-proBNP	 can	 be	 useful	 in	 PAH	 screening	 and	 in	 monitoring	 the	
response	to	treatment,	elevated	levels	are	not	specific	for	PAH	and	also	
occur	in	other	forms	of	right	and	left	heart	disease.	Despite	more	favor-
able	hemodynamics	of	SSc-associated	PAH,	its	prognosis	is	worse	and	
treatment	response	poorer	than	for	idiopathic	PAH.	This	is	most	likely	
due	to	frequent	concurrence	of	ILD	and	cardiac	disease	in	patients.

 ■ GASTROINTESTINAL INVOLVEMENT
Variable	involvement	of	the	gastrointestinal	(GI)	tract,	which	can	affect	
any	 level,	 is	 the	 most	 common	 internal	 organ	 manifestation	 of	 SSc,	
seen	in	up	to	90%	of	SSc	patients	with	both	limited	and	diffuse	cuta-
neous	disease	(Table 360-6).	Severe	GI	tract	involvement	is	associated	
with	male	sex	and	specific	autoantibodies.	The	pathologic	findings	of	
GI	 involvement	 in	 SSc	 include	 fibrosis,	 smooth-muscle	 atrophy,	 and	
obliterative	small	vessel	vasculopathy	throughout	the	length	of	the	GI	
tract.	Together	they	have	major	impact	on	quality	of	life,	malnutrition,	
and	mortality.

Upper  Gastrointestinal  Tract  Involvement  Decreased	 oral	
aperture	 interferes	 with	 regular	 dental	 hygiene.	 Loss	 of	 periodontal	
ligament	attaching	teeth	to	the	alveolar	bone	leads	to	teeth	loosening.	
Additional	 oropharyngeal	 manifestations	 due	 to	 a	 combination	 of	
xerostomia,	 shortened	 frenulum,	 and	 resorption	 of	 the	 mandibular	
condyles	 cause	 much	 distress.	 Most	 SSc	 patients	 show	 symptoms	 of	
GERD	(heartburn,	regurgitation,	and	dysphagia)	due	to	a	combination	
of	 reduced	 lower	 esophageal	 sphincter	 pressure	 resulting	 in	 reflux,	
impaired	 esophageal	 clearance	 of	 refluxed	 gastric	 contents	 due	 to	
diminished	 motility,	 and	 delayed	 gastric	 emptying.	 Calcium	 channel

antagonists	and	phosphodiesterase	inhibitors	commonly	used	to	treat	
Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 in	 SSc	 can	 further	 aggravate	 reflux.	 Esoph-
ageal	 manometry	 shows	 abnormal	 motility	 in	 most	 patients,	 even	 in	
the	absence	of	symptoms.	Common	extraesophageal	GERD	manifes-
tations	in	SSc	include	hoarseness,	cough,	and	chronic	microaspiration,	
which	can	aggravate	underlying	ILD.	Characteristic	chest	CT	findings	
include	dilated	patulous	esophagus	with	intraluminal	air.	Esophageal	
dilation	 is	 associated	 with	 the	 severity	 of	 ILD.	 Endoscopy	 may	 be	
indicated	in	patients	with	dysphagia	in	order	to	rule	out	opportunistic	
infections	 with	 Candida,	 herpes	 virus,	 and	 cytomegalovirus.	 Severe	
erosive	esophagitis	may	be	found	in	patients	with	minimal	symptoms.	
Esophageal	strictures	and	Barrett’s	esophagus	may	complicate	chronic	
GERD	in	SSc	patients.	Because	Barrett’s	metaplasia	is	associated	with	
increased	risk	of	adenocarcinoma,	these	patients	require	regular	sur-
veillance	endoscopy	with	biopsy.

Gastroparesis	 with	 early	 satiety,	 abdominal	 distention,	 and	 aggra-
vated	reflux	symptoms	is	common.	Barium	contrast	studies	are	neither	
sensitive	 nor	 specific	 for	 evaluation	 of	 gastric	 involvement	 in	 SSc.	
Gastric	antral	vascular	ectasia	(GAVE)	in	the	antrum	may	occur.	These	
subepithelial	lesions,	reflecting	the	widespread	small	vessel	vasculop-
athy	of	SSc,	are	called	“watermelon	stomach”	due	to	their	endoscopic	
appearance.	GAVE	may	present	with	recurrent	episodes	of	GI	bleed-
ing,	resulting	in	chronic	unexplained	anemia.	Patients	with	SSc	show	
increased	prevalence	of	Helicobacter pylori	infection	in	the	stomach.

Lower  Gastrointestinal  Tract  and  Anorectal  Involvement 	
Weight	loss	and	malnutrition	due	to	a	combination	impaired	intestinal	
motility,	 malabsorption,	 and	 chronic	 diarrhea	 secondary	 to	 bacterial	
overgrowth	are	common.	Fat	and	protein	malabsorption	and	vitamin	
B12	and	vitamin	D	deficiency	ensue	and	may	be	further	exacerbated	by	
pancreatic	insufficiency.	Disturbed	intestinal	motor	function	can	also	
lead	 to	 episodic	 intestinal	 pseudo-	 obstruction,	 with	 symptoms	 that	
are	indistinguishable	from	those	of	delayed	gastric	emptying.	Patients	
present	with	acute	abdominal	pain,	nausea,	and	vomiting,	and	radio-
graphic	studies	show	acute	intestinal	obstruction.	A	major	diagnostic	
challenge	 is	 differentiating	 pseudo-obstruction,	 which	 responds	 to	
supportive	 care	 and	 intravenous	 nutritional	 supplementation,	 from	
mechanical	 obstruction.	 Colonic	 involvement	 in	 SSc	 may	 result	 in	
constipation,	 occasionally	 complicated	 by	 sigmoid	 volvulus,	 fecal	
incontinence,	GI	bleeding	from	telangiectasia,	and	rectal	prolapse.	In	
late-stage	 SSc,	 wide-mouth	 sacculations	 or	 diverticula	 occur	 in	 the

2782 colon	 and	 occasionally	 cause	 perfora-
tion	 and	 bleeding.	 An	 unusual	 radio-
logic	 finding	 is	 pneumatosis	 cystoides	
intestinalis,	which	is	due	to	air	trapping	
in	 the	 bowel	 wall	 that	 may	 rarely	 rup-
ture	 and	 cause	 benign	 pneumoperito-
neum.	 Studies	 of	 the	 fecal	 microbiota	
in	 SSc	 show	 a	 reduction	 in	 protective	
butyrate-producing	 bacteria,	 potentially	
promoting	a	proinflammatory	intestinal	
microenvironment.	Although	the	liver	is	
rarely	affected	in	patients	with	SSc,	pri-
mary	biliary	cirrhosis	may	occur,	partic-
ularly	in	patients	with	limited	cutaneous	
disease.

 ■ RENAL INVOLVEMENT: 
SCLERODERMA RENAL 
CRISIS
Scleroderma	 renal	 crisis	 presents	 with	
accelerated	 hypertension	 accompanied	
by	acute	kidney	injury	and	progressive	failure.	This	acute	life-threat-
ening	 complication	 occurs	 in	 <15%	 of	 SSc	 patients,	 almost	 always	
within	4	years	of	disease	onset.	Scleroderma	renal	crisis	can	occasion-
ally	 even	 be	 the	 presenting	 manifestation	 of	 SSc.	 While	 short-term	
survival	 in	 scleroderma	 renal	 crisis	 was	 <10%	 prior	 to	 the	 advent	 of	
angiotensin-converting	 enzyme	 (ACE)	 inhibitors,	 outcomes	 for	 this	
serous	complication	have	shown	great	improvement.	The	pathogenesis	
involves	 obliterative	 vasculopathy	 of	 the	 renal	 arcuate	 and	 interlob-
ular	 arteries,	 with	 consequent	 intravascular	 hemolysis	 (Fig.  360-13).	
Progressive	 reduction	 in	 renal	 blood	 flow,	 aggravated	 by	 vasospasm,	
leads	to	increased	juxtaglomerular	renin	secretion	and	angiotensin	II	
generation,	 with	 further	 renal	 vasoconstriction	 resulting	 in	 a	 vicious	
cycle	 that	 culminates	 in	 accelerated	 hypertension.	 Risk	 factors	 for	
scleroderma	renal	crisis	include	African-American	race,	male	sex,	and	
diffuse	 or	 progressive	 skin	 involvement.	 Up	 to	 50%	 of	 patients	 with	
scleroderma	renal	crisis	have	antibodies	to	anti-RNA	polymerase	III,	
whereas	 patients	 with	 anti-centromere	 antibodies	 appear	 protected.	
Palpable	 tendon	 friction	 rubs,	 pericardial	 effusion,	 new	 unexplained	
anemia,	and	thrombocytopenia	may	be	harbingers	of	impending	scle-
roderma	 renal	 crisis.	 High-risk	 patients	 with	 early-stage	 SSc	 should	
monitor	 their	 blood	 pressure	 daily.	 Because	 glucocorticoid	 use	 is	
associated	 with	 scleroderma	 renal	 crisis,	 prednisone	 in	 high-risk	 SSc	
patients	 should	 be	 taken	 only	 when	 absolutely	 required	 and	 at	 low	
doses	(<10	mg/d).

Patients	with	scleroderma	renal	crisis	characteristically	present	with	
accelerated	hypertension	(generally	>150/90	mmHg)	and	progressive	
oliguric	 renal	 insufficiency.	 However,	 ~10%	 of	 patients	 present	 with	
blood	 pressure	 in	 the	 normal	 range.	 Normotensive	 renal	 crisis	 is	
generally	associated	with	a	poor	outcome.	Headache,	blurred	vision,	
congestive	heart	failure,	and	pulmonary	edema	may	accompany	ele-
vation	of	blood	pressure.	Moderate	thrombocytopenia	and	microan-
giopathic	 hemolysis	 with	 fragmented	 red	 blood	 cells	 can	 be	 seen,	
and	 urinalysis	 typically	 shows	 mild	 proteinuria,	 granular	 casts,	 and	
microscopic	hematuria.	Progressive	oliguric	renal	failure	over	several	
days	 generally	 follows.	 Scleroderma	 renal	 crisis	 is	 sometimes	 misdi-
agnosed	 as	 thrombotic	 thrombocytopenic	 purpura	 (TTP)	 or	 other	
forms	 of	 thrombotic	 microangiopathy.	 In	 such	 cases,	 renal	 biopsy	
and	determination	of	serum	von	Willebrand	factor–cleaving	protease	
activity	 may	 be	 of	 benefit.	 The	 presence	 of	 oliguria	 or	 a	 creatinine	
>3	 mg/dL	 at	 initial	 presentation	 predicts	 poor	 outcome	 (permanent	
hemodialysis	and	mortality),	as	do	vascular	thrombosis	and	glomer-
ular	 ischemic	 collapse	 on	 renal	 biopsy.	 Crescentic	 glomerulonephri-
tis	 in	 the	 setting	 of	 SSc	 has	 been	 described	 and	 may	 be	 associated	
with	myeloperoxidase-specific	antineutrophil	cytoplasmic	antibodies	
(ANCAs).	 Membranous	 glomerulonephritis	 may	 occur	 in	 patients	
treated	 with	 D-penicillamine.	 Asymptomatic	 renal	 impairment	 can

occur	in	up	to	half	of	SSc	patients,	is	commonly	associated	with	other	
vascular	 manifestations,	 and	 rarely	 progresses	 to	 end-stage	 renal		
failure.

 ■ CARDIAC INVOLVEMENT
Although	it	is	often	silent,	cardiac	involvement	is	detected	in	10–50%	
of	 SSc	 patients	 screened	 with	 sensitive	 diagnostic	 tools.	 Clinical	 car-
diac	 involvement	 is	 more	 frequent	 in	 dcSSc	 than	 in	 lcSSc	 and	 may	
be	primary	or	secondary	to	PAH,	ILD,	or	renal	involvement.	Cardiac	
involvement	 in	 SSc	 is	 associated	 with	 poor	 outcomes.	 The	 endocar-
dium,	myocardium,	and	pericardium	may	each	be	affected	separately	
or	 together.	 Pericardial	 involvement	 is	 manifested	 as	 pericarditis,	
pericardial	effusions,	constrictive	pericarditis,	and	rarely,	cardiac	tam-
ponade.	 Conduction	 system	 fibrosis	 is	 common	 and	 may	 be	 silent	
or	 manifested	 by	 heart	 block.	 Other	 arrhythmias	 include	 prema-
ture	 ventricular	 contractions,	 atrial	 fibrillation,	 and	 supraventricular	
tachycardia.	 Microvascular	 involvement,	 recurrent	 vasospasm,	 and	
ischemia-reperfusion	injury	contribute	to	patchy	myocardial	fibrosis,	
and	the	resulting	systolic	or	diastolic	left	ventricular	dysfunction	may	
progress	to	overt	heart	failure.	Acute	or	subacute	myocarditis	leading	
to	 left	 ventricular	 dysfunction	 may	 occur,	 best	 diagnosed	 by	 cardiac	
magnetic	 resonance	 imaging	 or	 endomyocardial	 biopsy.	 While	 con-
ventional	echocardiography	has	low	sensitivity	for	detecting	preclinical	
heart	 involvement	 in	 SSc,	 newer	 modalities	 such	 as	 tissue	 Doppler	
echocardiography	 (TDE),	 cardiac	 MRI,	 and	 nuclear	 imaging	 (single-
photon	emission	CT	[SPECT])	reveal	a	high	prevalence	of	abnormal	
myocardial	function	or	perfusion.	The	serum	levels	of	NT-proBNP,	a	
ventricular	 hormone	 elevated	 in	 SSc-PAH,	 may	 also	 have	 utility	 as	 a	
marker	of	primary	cardiac	involvement.

 ■ MUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS
Musculoskeletal	complications	are	commonly	seen	in	SSc.	Carpal	tun-
nel	 syndrome	 may	 be	 a	 presenting	 disease	 manifestation,	 and	 gener-
alized	arthralgia	and	stiffness	are	prominent	in	early	disease.	Mobility	
of	both	small	and	large	joints	is	progressively	impaired,	and	fixed	con-
tractures	at	the	proximal	interphalangeal	joints	and	wrists	ensue.	Large	
joint	 contractures	 occur	 in	 patients	 with	 dcSSc	 and	 are	 frequently	
accompanied	 by	 tendon	 friction	 rubs.	 These	 are	 characterized	 by	
coarse	leathery	crepitation	heard	or	palpated	upon	passive	joint	move-
ment	and	are	caused	by	fibrosis	and	adhesion	of	the	tendon	sheaths	and	
fascial	planes	at	the	affected	joint.	The	presence	of	tendon	friction	rubs	
is	 associated	 with	 increased	 risk	 for	 renal	 and	 cardiac	 complications	
and	reduced	survival.	Synovitis	seen	on	ultrasound	or	MRI	is	common;	
occasional	 SSc	 patients	 develop	 erosive	 polyarthritis	 in	 the	 hands,	
and	some	may	have	a	seropositive	rheumatoid	arthritis	overlap.	Mus-
cle	 weakness	 is	 common	 and	 multifactorial;	 deconditioning,	 disuse

atrophy,	malnutrition,	inflammation,	and	fibrosis	may	all	contribute.	A	
chronic	noninflammatory	form	of	myopathy	characterized	by	atrophy	
and	fibrosis	with	mildly	elevated	muscle	enzymes	occurs	in	late-stage	
SSc.	Bone	resorption	in	the	terminal	phalanges	causes	the	character-
istic	 loss	 of	 the	 distal	 tufts	 (acro-osteolysis)	 (Fig.	 360-5).	 Resorption	
of	the	mandibular	condyles	can	lead	to	bite	difficulties.	Osteolysis	can	
also	affect	the	ribs	and	distal	clavicles.

 ■ LESS RECOGNIZED DISEASE MANIFESTATIONS
Dry	eyes	and	dry	mouth	(sicca	complex)	are	common	in	SSc.	Biopsy	of	
the	minor	salivary	glands	in	these	cases	shows	fibrosis	rather	than	focal	
lymphocytic	infiltration	characteristic	of	primary	Sjögren’s	syndrome	
(Chap.  361).	 Hypothyroidism	 resulting	 from	 Graves’	 or	 Hashimoto’s	
disease	is	common,	particularly	in	lcSSc,	and	may	be	underrecognized.	
Whereas	 the	 central	 nervous	 system	 is	 generally	 spared	 in	 SSc,	 uni-
lateral	 or	 bilateral	 sensory	 trigeminal	 neuropathy	 can	 occur.	 Erectile	
dysfunction	is	a	frequent	and	occasionally	initial	disease	manifestation.	
Inability	to	attain	or	maintain	penile	erection	is	due	to	vascular	insuf-
ficiency	and	fibrosis	of	corporeal	smooth	muscle	and	responds	poorly	
to	 medical	 therapy.	 Sexual	 performance	 is	 also	 adversely	 affected	 in	
women.	While	fertility	is	not	impaired	in	SSc,	pregnancy	is	associated	
with	a	higher	risk	of	adverse	fetal	outcomes.	Furthermore,	cardiopul-
monary	involvement	may	worsen	during	pregnancy,	and	new	onset	of	
scleroderma	renal	crisis	has	been	described.

Cancer  Epidemiologic	 studies	 indicate	 an	 increased	 cancer	 risk	
in	 SSc.	 Lung	 cancer	 and	 esophageal	 adenocarcinoma	 typically	 occur	
in	 the	 setting	 of	 long-standing	 ILD	 or	 GERD	 and	 may	 be	 linked	 to	
chronic	inflammation	and	tissue	repair.	In	contrast,	breast,	lung,	and	
ovarian	 carcinomas	 and	 lymphomas	 tend	 to	 occur	 in	 close	 temporal	
association	 with	 the	 onset	 of	 SSc,	 particularly	 in	 patients	 who	 have	
autoantibodies	to	RNA	polymerase	III.	In	this	scenario,	SSc	may	rep-
resent	 a	 paraneoplastic	 syndrome	 that	 is	 triggered	 by	 the	 antitumor	
immune	response.

 ■ LABORATORY EVALUATION AND BIOMARKERS
Mild	 microcytic	 anemia	 is	 frequent	 and	 may	 indicate	 recurrent	 GI	
bleeding	caused	by	GAVE	or	chronic	esophagitis.	Macrocytic	anemia	
may	 be	 caused	 by	 folate	 and	 vitamin	 B12	 deficiency	 due	 to	 small-
bowel	 bacterial	 overgrowth	 and	 malabsorption	 or	 by	 drugs	 such	 as	
methotrexate.	Microangiopathic	hemolytic	anemia	caused	by	mechan-
ical	 fragmentation	 of	 red	 blood	 cells	 during	 their	 passage	 through	
microvessels	 coated	 with	 fibrin	 or	 platelet	 thrombi	 is	 a	 hallmark	 of	
scleroderma	renal	crisis.	The	erythrocyte	sedimentation	rate	(ESR)	is	
generally	 normal	 in	 SSc;	 an	 elevation	 may	 signal	 coexisting	 myositis	
or	malignancy.

Antinuclear	 autoantibodies	 are	 detected	 in	 almost	 all	 patients	 with	
SSc.	 Anti-topoisomerase	 I	 (Scl-70)	 and	 anti-centromere	 antibodies	
are	 mutually	 exclusive	 and	 highly	 specific	 for	 SSc.	 Topoisomerase	 I	
(Scl-70)	antibodies	are	associated	with	increased	risk	of	ILD	and	poor	
outcomes.	 Anti-centromere	 antibodies	 are	 associated	 with	 PAH,	 but	
only	infrequently	with	significant	cardiac,	pulmonary,	or	renal	involve-
ment.	 Nucleolar	 immunofluorescence	 pattern	 may	 indicate	 antibodies	
to	 U3-RNP	 (fibrillarin),	 Th/To,	 or	 PM/Scl,	 whereas	 speckled	 immu-
nofluorescence	 indicates	 antibodies	 to	 RNA	 polymerase	 III,	 associ-
ated	 with	 increased	 risk	 of	 scleroderma	 renal	 crisis	 and	 malignancy		
(Fig. 360-14).

 ■ DIAGNOSIS, STAGING, AND MONITORING
The	diagnosis	of	SSc	is	made	primarily	on	clinical	grounds	and	is	gen-
erally	straightforward	in	patients	with	established	disease.	Diagnostic	
criteria	developed	for	classification	are	>90%	specific	and	sensitive	for	
SSc.	The	presence	of	skin	induration	with	a	characteristic	symmetric	
distribution	 pattern	 associated	 with	 typical	 visceral	 organ	 manifes-
tations	 establishes	 the	 diagnosis	 with	 a	 high	 degree	 of	 certainty.	 In	
lcSSc,	 a	 history	 of	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 and	 GERD	 symptoms,	
coupled	 with	 sclerodactyly	 and	 nailfold	 capillary	 changes,	 often	 in	
combinations	with	cutaneous	telangiectasia	and	calcinosis	cutis,	helps	

to	establish	the	diagnosis.	Primary	Raynaud’s	disease	is	a	benign	con-
dition	that	must	be	differentiated	from	early	or	limited	SSc.	Nailfold	
microscopy	is	particularly	helpful	in	this	situation,	because	in	contrast	
to	SSc,	nailfold	capillaries	are	normal.	Diagnosing	SSc	at	an	early	stage	
may	be	a	challenge.	In	dcSSc,	initial	symptoms	are	often	nonspecific,	
Raynaud’s	phenomenon	may	be	absent,	and	physical	examination	may	
only	 show	 upper	 extremity	 edema	 and	 puffy	 fingers.	 Early-stage	 SSc	
might	 be	 initially	 misdiagnosed	 as	 arthritis,	 SLE,	 myositis,	 or,	 most	
commonly,	undifferentiated	connective	tissue	disease	leading	to	delays	
in	 diagnosis.	 Within	 weeks	 to	 months,	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 and	
advancing	skin	induration	appear.	SSc-specific	autoantibodies	provide	
a	 high	 degree	 of	 diagnostic	 certainty.	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 with	
fingertip	 ulcerations	 or	 other	 evidence	 of	 digital	 ischemia,	 coupled	
with	telangiectasia,	distal	esophageal	dysmotility,	unexplained	ILD	or	
PAH,	or	accelerated	hypertension	with	renal	failure	in	the	absence	of	
clinically	 evident	 skin	 induration,	 suggests	 the	 diagnosis	 of	 SSc	 sine	
scleroderma.	Patients	with	a	new	diagnosis	of	SSc	should	be	screened	
for	ILD,	followed	by	regular	pulmonary	monitoring	for	several	years	
(Fig. 360-15).

MANAGEMENT OF SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS
 ■ OVERVIEW: GENERAL PRINCIPLES
To	date,	no	therapy	has	been	shown	to	significantly	alter	the	natural	
history	 of	 SSc.	 In	 contrast,	 numerous	 interventions	 are	 effective	 in	
alleviating	 the	 symptoms,	 slowing	 the	 progression	 of	 the	 cumulative	
organ	damage,	and	reducing	disability.	Moreover,	a	significant	decrease	
in	disease-related	mortality	has	been	noted	during	the	past	25	years.	In	
light	of	the	marked	heterogeneity	in	disease	manifestations,	course,	and	
outcomes,	optimized	care	for	patients	with	SSc	requires	a	thoughtful	
“precision	medicine”	approach	that	is	tailored	specifically	to	each	indi-
vidual	patient’s	unique	needs.

The	 following	 general	 principles	 should	 guide	 management	
(Table  360-7):	 prompt	 and	 accurate	 diagnosis;	 patient	 subclassifica-
tion	 and	 risk	 stratification	 based	 on	 clinical,	 radiologic,	 and	 labora-
tory	 evaluation,	 including	 autoantibody	 profiles	 and	 prognostic	 and	
predictive	biomarkers;	early	recognition	of	organ-based	complications	
and	 assessment	 of	 their	 extent,	 severity,	 and	 likelihood	 of	 deteriora-
tion;	 regular	 monitoring	 for	 disease	 progression,	 new	 complications,	
and	 response	 to	 and	 side	 effects	 of	 therapy;	 adjusting	 therapy;	 and	
patient	education.	In	order	to	minimize	the	risk	of	irreversible	organ	
damage,	 management	 should	 be	 individualized	 and	 proactive,	 with	
regular	screening	and	initiation	of	appropriate	intervention	at	the	ear-
liest	 possible	 opportunity.	 In	 light	 of	 the	 complex	 and	 multisystemic	
nature	of	the	SSc,	a	team-oriented	management	approach	integrating	
appropriate	 specialists	 should	 be	 pursued.	 Most	 patients	 are	 treated	
with	a	combination	of	drugs	that	impact	different	aspects	of	the	dis-
ease.	Patients	should	be	encouraged	to	become	familiar	with	potential	
complications	and	therapeutic	options,	including	interventional	trials,	
and	 natural	 history	 and	 should	 be	 empowered	 to	 partner	 with	 their	
treating	 physicians.	 This	 requires	 a	 long-term	 relationship	 between	
patient	and	physician,	with	ongoing	counseling,	encouragement,	and	
two-way	dialogue.

 ■ DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPY: 
IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENTS
Immunosuppressive	 agents	 used	 in	 other	 autoimmune	 diseases	 have	
generally	shown	modest	or	no	benefit	in	SSc.	Glucocorticoids	alleviate	
stiffness	 and	 aching	 in	 early	 inflammatory-stage	 dcSSc	 but	 do	 not	
influence	the	progression	of	skin	or	internal	organ	involvement.	Since	
their	use	is	associated	with	an	increased	risk	of	scleroderma	renal	crisis,	
glucocorticoids	should	be	given	only	when	absolutely	necessary,	at	the	
lowest	dose	possible,	and	for	brief	periods	only.

Cyclophosphamide	has	been	extensively	studied	in	light	of	its	effi-
cacy	in	the	treatment	of	vasculitis	(Chap. 363),	SLE	(Chap. 356),	and	
other	 autoimmune	 diseases	 (Chap.  355).	 Both	 oral	 and	 intravenous	
cyclophosphamide	 have	 been	 shown	 to	 reduce	 the	 progression	 of	
SSc-associated	ILD,	with	stabilization	and,	rarely,	modest	improvement

of	 pulmonary	 function,	 HRCT	 findings,	 respiratory	 symptoms,	 and	
skin	induration.	These	benefits	of	cyclophosphamide	need	to	be	bal-
anced	 against	 its	 potential	 toxicity,	 including	 bone	 marrow	 suppres-
sion,	opportunistic	infections,	hemorrhagic	cystitis	and	bladder	cancer,	
premature	ovarian	failure,	and	late	secondary	malignancies.

Methotrexate	 had	 modest	 effect	 on	 SSc	 skin	 involvement	 in	 small	
studies.	Mycophenolate	mofetil	was	evaluated	in	both	open-label	and	
randomized	controlled	trials.	Both	skin	induration	and	ILD	improved	
in	patients	treated	with	mycophenolate	mofetil,	and	the	drug	was	well	
tolerated.	Tocilizumab,	a	monoclonal	antibody	that	blocks	IL-6	recep-
tor	signaling,	also	showed	benefit	on	both	skin	and	lung	involvement	
in	 randomized	 SSc	 trials.	 Open-label	 studies	 and	 small	 clinical	 trials	
provide	some	support	for	rituximab,	a	monoclonal	antibody	directed	
against	 the	 mature	 B-cell	 marker	 CD20,	 along	 with	 extracorporeal	
photopheresis,	 IV	 immunoglobulin,	 and	 abatacept,	 a	 fusion	 protein	
that	 inhibits	 T-cell	 co-stimulation	 and	 function.	 The	 use	 of	 cyclo-
sporine,	 azathioprine,	 hydroxychloroquine	 (Plaquenil),	 thalidomide,	
and	rapamycin	for	SSc	therapy	is	currently	not	well	supported	by	the	
literature.	Intensive	immune	ablation	using	high-dose	chemotherapy,	
followed	by	autologous	hematopoietic	stem	cell	reconstitution	therapy	
(HSCT),	 was	 associated	 with	 durable	 remission	 and	 improved	 long-
term	survival	in	multiple	randomized	clinical	trials.	Currently,	HSCT	
is	 indicated	 for	 selected	 patients	 with	 severe	 SSc	 but	 carries	 poten-
tial	 morbidity	 and	 mortality,	 as	 well	 as	 significant	 cost.	 Additional	

forms	 of	 potentially	 disease-modifying	 cellular	 therapies	 are	 under	
investigation.

Antifibrotic Therapy  Because	tissue	fibrosis	underlies	organ	damage	
in	SSc,	drugs	that	interfere	with	the	fibrotic	process	represent	a	rational	
therapeutic	approach.	In	older	retrospective	studies,	D-penicillamine	
was	 shown	 to	 stabilize	 skin	 induration,	 prevent	 new	 internal	 organ	
involvement,	and	improve	survival.	However,	a	randomized	controlled	
clinical	trial	in	early	active	SSc	found	no	difference	in	the	extent	of	skin	
involvement	between	patients	treated	with	standard-dose	(750	mg/d)	
or	 very	 low-dose	 (125	 mg	 every	 other	 day)	 D-penicillamine.	 Recent	
clinical	trials	show	benefit	of	the	tyrosine	kinase	inhibitor	nintedanib,	
alone	or	in	combination	with	mycophenolate,	in	patients	with	SSc-ILD,	
with	significant	slowing	of	the	loss	of	lung	function.

Vascular  Therapy  The	 goal	 of	 Raynaud’s	 therapy	 is	 to	 control	
episodes,	prevent	and	enhance	the	healing	of	ischemic	complications,	
and	slow	the	progression	of	obliterative	vasculopathy.	Patients	should	
dress	warmly,	minimize	cold	exposure,	and	avoid	drugs	that	precipitate	
or	exacerbate	vasospastic	episodes.	Extended-release	dihydropyridine	
calcium	 channel	 blockers	 such	 as	 amlodipine	 and	 nifedipine,	 as	 well	
as	diltiazem,	ameliorate	Raynaud’s	phenomenon,	but	their	use	is	often	
limited	 by	 side	 effects	 (palpitations,	 dependent	 edema,	 worsening	
gastroesophageal	 reflux).	 While	 ACE	 inhibitors	 do	 not	 reduce	 the

as	losartan	are	effective	and	well	tolerated.	Patients	with	Raynaud’s	phe-

α1-adrenergic	 receptor	 blockers	 (e.g.,	 prazosin),	 phosphodiesterase-5

tomy	and	intradigital	injections	of	botulinum	type	A	(Botox)	may	be	
considered	in	patients	with	severe	ongoing	ischemia.	Empirical	long-

of	vascular	damage	and	obliteration.	There	is	limited	evidence-based

information	for	the	treatment	of	cardiac	complications	of	SSc,	which	
should	 be	 guided	 by	 specialists	 experienced	 in	 their	 diagnosis	 and	
management.	While	selective	beta	blockers	such	as	metoprolol	can	pre-
cipitate	vasospasm,	nondihydropyridine	calcium	channel	blockers	can	
be	used	for	rate	control	in	atrial	arrhythmias,	and	nonselective	alpha/
beta	blockers	such	as	carvedilol	can	be	used	for	improving	myocardial	
perfusion	and	left	ventricular	systolic	function.

TREATMENT 
SSC-ASSOCIATED INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE
ILD	 is	 a	 leading	 cause	 of	 death	 in	 patients	 with	 SSc.	 However,	
because	 the	 course	 of	 SSc-associated	 ILD	 is	 highly	 variable,	 it	 is	
important	 to	 identify	 patients	 who	 are	 at	 high	 risk	 for	 disease	
progression.	 The	 extent	 of	 ILD	 on	 HRCT	 and	 the	 FVC	 at	 initial	
evaluation	and	the	decline	in	FVC	during	the	preceding	12-month	
period	are	helpful	in	identifying	these	patients.	Additionally,	male	
sex,	older	age	at	initial	presentation,	progressive	skin	involvement,	
and	 myocardial	 disease	 may	 be	 risk	 factors	 for	 ILD	 progression.	
Patients	 at	 high	 risk	 for	 ILD	 should	 be	 monitored	 by	 performing	
PFTs	every	6	months	(Fig.	360-15);	serial	HRCT	imaging	is	not	rec-
ommended.	Cyclophosphamide,	given	IV	or	orally	for	6–12	months,

and	mycophenolate	mofetil	slow	the	decline	in	lung	function	and	
improve	respiratory	symptoms,	but	cyclophosphamide	is	associated	
with	 more	 frequent	 side	 effects.	 The	 efficacy	 and	 optimal	 dura-
tion	 of	 antifibrotic	 therapy	 with	 nintedanib,	 which	 was	 recently	
approved	for	SSc-associated	ILD,	are	currently	under	investigation.	
In	patients	who	show	continued	progression	of	ILD	despite	med-
ical	 therapy,	 lung	 transplantation	 might	 be	 considered	 as	 a	 life-	
prolonging	procedure,	although	significant	GERD	contributing	to	
organ	rejection	is	a	concern	in	SSc.	Recurrence	of	SSc-ILD	in	trans-
planted	lung	allografts	has	not	been	reported.	

TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL COMPLICATIONS
including	 decreased	 oral	 aperture,	
Because	 oral	 problems,	
decreased	 saliva	 production,	 gum	 recession,	 periodontal	 disease,	
and	teeth	loss,	are	common,	regular	dental	care	is	recommended.	
Gastroesophageal	reflux	is	very	common	in	SSc	and	may	occur	in	
the	absence	of	symptoms.	Patients	should	be	instructed	to	elevate	
the	 head	 of	 the	 bed,	 eat	 frequent	 small	 meals,	 and	 avoid	 alcohol,	
caffeine,	 known	 reflux	 exacerbants,	 and	 meals	 before	 bedtime.	
Proton	 pump	 inhibitors	 to	 reduce	 acid	 reflux	 may	 need	 to	 be	
given	 in	 relatively	 high	 doses.	 Prokinetic	 agents	 such	 as	 meto-
clopramide,	 erythromycin	 (a	 motilin	 agonist),	 and	 domperidone	
may	 occasionally	 be	 helpful	 in	 SSc	 but	 are	 frequently	 associated	
with	side	effects.	Botulinum	toxin	injection	sometimes	ameliorates	
impaired	 gastric	 emptying.	 Antireflux	 procedures	 such	 as	 Nissen	
fundoplication	 can	 result	 in	 secondary	 achalasia	 and	 generally	
should	 be	 avoided.	 Episodic	 bleeding	 from	 GAVE	 (watermelon	
stomach)	 may	 be	 treated	 with	 endoscopic	 ablation	 using	 laser	 or	
argon	 plasma	 photocoagulation,	 although	 it	 commonly	 recurs.	 In	
some	 patients,	 enteral	 feeding	 and/or	 decompression	 via	 percuta-
neous	 gastrostomy	 or	 jejunostomy	 may	 become	 necessary.	 Small	
intestinal	bacterial	overgrowth	secondary	to	gut	dysmotility	causes	
abdominal	 bloating	 and	 diarrhea	 and	 may	 lead	 to	 malabsorption	
and	severe	malnutrition.	Short	courses	of	rotating	broad-spectrum	
antibiotics	 such	 as	 metronidazole,	 erythromycin,	 and	 rifaximin	
can	eradicate	bacterial	overgrowth.	Small	bowel	hypomotility	may	
respond	to	octreotide,	but	pseudo-obstruction	is	difficult	to	treat.	
Fecal	 incontinence,	 a	 frequent	 but	 underreported	 complication,	
may	 respond	 to	 antidiarrheal	 medication,	 biofeedback,	 sphincter	
augmentation,	and	sacral	neuromodulation.	Potential	malnutrition	
should	be	routinely	assessed.	

TREATMENT OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION
In	 SSc,	 PAH	 carries	 an	 extremely	 poor	 prognosis	 and	 accounts	
for	 30%	 of	 deaths.	 Because	 PAH	 is	 asymptomatic	 until	 advanced,	
patients	 with	 SSc	 should	 be	 screened	 at	 initial	 evaluation	 and	
regularly	 thereafter.	 Treatment	
is	 generally	 started	 with	 an	
oral	 endothelin-1	 receptor	 antagonist	 such	 as	 bosentan	 or	 a	 	
phosphodiesterase-5	inhibitor	such	as	sildenafil.	Recently,	the	solu-
ble	guanylate	cyclase	stimulator	riociguat,	which	acts	by	increasing	
the	 production	 of	 nitric	 oxide,	 and	 the	 selective	 IP	 prostacyclin	
receptor	agonist	selexipag	were	shown	to	improve	PAH	symptoms	
and	 survival.	 Patients	 may	 also	 require	 diuretics	 and	 digoxin.	 If	
hypoxemia	 is	 documented,	 supplemental	 oxygen	 should	 be	 pre-
scribed	 in	 order	 to	 avoid	 secondary	 pulmonary	 vasoconstriction.	
Prostacyclin	 analogues	 such	 as	 epoprostenol	 or	 treprostinil	 can	
be	given	by	continuous	IV	or	SC	infusion	or	via	intermittent	neb-
ulized	 inhalations.	 Combination	 therapy	 with	 different	 classes	 of	
agents	acting	additively	or	synergistically	is	often	necessary.	Lung	
transplantation	 remains	 an	 option	 for	 selected	 SSc	 patients	 with	
PAH	who	fail	medical	therapy,	and	2-year	survival	rates	(64%)	are	
comparable	to	those	of	idiopathic	ILD	or	PAH.	

MANAGEMENT OF RENAL CRISIS
Scleroderma	 renal	 crisis	 represents	 a	 medical	 emergency.	 Since	
its	outcome	is	largely	determined	by	the	extent	of	renal	damage	at	
the	time	that	aggressive	therapy	is	initiated,	prompt	recognition	of	
impending	or	early	scleroderma	renal	crisis	is	essential,	and	efforts	
should	 be	 made	 to	 avoid	 its	 occurrence.	 High-risk	 SSc	 patients	

(early	disease,	extensive	and	progressive	skin	involvement,	tendon	
friction	rubs,	and	anti-RNA	polymerase	III	antibodies)	should	be	
instructed	to	monitor	their	blood	pressure	daily	and	report	signifi-
cant	alterations	immediately.	Potentially	nephrotoxic	drugs	should	
be	 avoided,	 and	 glucocorticoids	 should	 be	 used	 only	 when	 abso-
lutely	necessary	and	at	low	doses.	Patients	presenting	with	sclero-
derma	renal	crisis	should	be	immediately	hospitalized.	Once	other	
causes	 of	 acute	 renal	 disease	 are	 excluded,	 treatment	 should	 be	
started	promptly	with	titration	of	short-acting	ACE	inhibitors,	with	
the	goal	of	rapid	normalization	of	the	blood	pressure.	In	patients	
with	 persistent	 hypertension,	 addition	 of	 angiotensin	 II	 receptor	
blockers,	calcium	channel	blockers,	endothelin-1	receptor	blockers,	
prostacyclins,	and	direct	renin	inhibitors	should	be	considered.	In	
light	of	evidence	for	intrarenal	complement	pathway	activation	in	
some	patients	with	scleroderma	renal	crisis,	addition	of	eculizumab	
to	ACE	inhibitors	may	be	considered.	Up	to	two-thirds	of	patients	
with	scleroderma	renal	crisis	necessitate	dialysis.	Substantial	renal	
recovery	can	occur	following	an	episode	of	scleroderma	renal	cri-
sis,	and	renal	replacement	therapy	can	be	ultimately	discontinued	
in	 30–50%	 of	 patients.	 Kidney	 transplantation	 is	 appropriate	 for	
patients	 unable	 to	 discontinue	 dialysis	 after	 2	 years.	 Survival	 of	
transplanted	 SSc	 patients	 is	 comparable	 to	 that	 of	 other	 diseases,	
and	recurrence	of	renal	crisis	is	rare.	

SKIN CARE
Because	skin	involvement	in	SSc	is	never	life-threatening	and	sta-
bilizes,	 and	 may	 even	 regress	 spontaneously,	 disease	 management	
should	not	be	dictated	by	its	cutaneous	manifestations.	The	inflam-
matory	symptoms	of	early	skin	involvement	can	be	controlled	with	
antihistamines	 and	 short-term	 use	 of	 low-dose	 glucocorticoids	 	
(<5	 mg/d	 of	 prednisone).	 Cyclophosphamide	 and	 methotrexate	
have	 modest	 effects	 on	 skin	 induration.	 Because	 the	 skin	 is	 dry,	
the	use	of	hydrophilic	ointments	and	bath	oils	is	encouraged,	and	
regular	 skin	 massage	 is	 helpful.	 Telangiectasia,	 which	 presents	
a	 cosmetic	 problem,	 especially	 on	 the	 face,	 can	 be	 treated	 with	
pulsed	 dye	 laser.	 Ischemic	 digital	 ulcerations	 should	 be	 protected	
by	 occlusive	 dressings	 to	 promote	 healing	 and	 prevent	 infection.	
Infected	skin	ulcers	are	treated	with	topical	antibiotics	and	surgical	
debridement.	While	no	therapy	has	been	shown	to	be	effective	in	
preventing	 soft-tissue	 calcific	 deposition	 or	 promoting	 its	 disso-
lution,	 reports	 support	 the	 use	 of	 minocycline,	 bisphosphonates,	
and	topical	or	IV	sodium	thiosulfate	(STS).	Additional	approaches	
include	carbon	dioxide	laser	treatment,	extracorporeal	shock-wave	
lithotripsy,	and	surgical	high-speed	microdrilling.	

TREATMENT OF MUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS
Arthralgia	 and	 joint	 stiffness	 are	 very	 common	 and	 distressing	
manifestations	in	early-stage	disease.	Short	courses	of	nonsteroidal	
anti-inflammatory	 agents,	 methotrexate,	 and	 cautious	 use	 of	 low-
dose	glucocorticoids	alleviate	symptoms.	Physical	and	occupational	
therapy	can	be	effective	for	preventing	loss	of	musculoskeletal	func-
tion	and	joint	contractures	and	should	be	initiated	early.

COURSE
The	 natural	 history	 of	 SSc	 is	 highly	 variable	 and	 difficult	 to	 predict,	
especially	in	early	stages	of	the	disease.	Patient	with	dcSSc	tend	to	have	
a	more	rapidly	progressive	course	and	worse	prognosis	than	those	with	
lcSSc.	Inflammatory	symptoms	of	early	dcSSc,	such	as	fatigue,	edema,	
joint	pain,	and	pruritus,	subside,	and	skin	thickening	reaches	a	plateau	
at	2–4	years	after	disease	onset.	It	is	during	the	early	edematous/inflam-
matory	 stage	 that	 life-threatening	 visceral	 organ	 involvement	 may	
develop.	While	existing	visceral	organ	involvement,	such	as	ILD,	may	
progress	even	after	skin	involvement	peaks,	new	organ	involvement	is	
rare.	Scleroderma	renal	crisis	generally	occurs	within	the	first	4	years	
of	disease.	In	late-stage	disease	(>6	years),	the	skin	is	usually	soft	and	
atrophic.	Skin	regression	characteristically	occurs	in	an	order	that	is	the	
reverse	 of	 initial	 involvement,	 with	 softening	 on	 the	 trunks	 followed	
by	 proximal	 and	 finally	 distal	 extremities;	 however,	 sclerodactyly	 and

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disordersfixed	finger	contractures	generally	persist.	Relapse	or	recurrence	of	skin	
thickening	after	peak	skin	involvement	has	been	reached	is	uncommon.	
Patients	 with	 lcSSc	 follow	 a	 clinical	 course	 that	 is	 markedly	 different	
than	 that	 of	 dcSSc.	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 typically	 precedes	 other	
disease	manifestations	by	years	or	even	decades.	Visceral	organ	compli-
cations	such	as	PAH	generally	develop	late	and	progress	slowly.

PROGNOSIS
SSc	 confers	 a	 substantial	 increase	 in	 the	 risk	 of	 premature	 death.	
Age-	and	gender-adjusted	mortality	rates	are	five-	to	eightfold	higher	
compared	to	the	general	population,	and	more	than	half	of	all	patients	
with	 SSc	 die	 from	 their	 disease.	 In	 one	 population-based	 study	 of	
SSc,	the	median	survival	was	11	years.	In	patients	with	dcSSc,	5-	and	
10-year	 survival	 rates	 are	 70%	 and	 55%,	 respectively,	 whereas	 in	
patients	 with	 lcSSc,	 5-	 and	 10-year	 survival	 rates	 are	 90%	 and	 75%,	
respectively.	The	prognosis	correlates	with	the	extent	of	skin	involve-
ment,	which	itself	is	a	surrogate	for	visceral	organ	involvement.	Major	
causes	 of	 death	 are	 PAH,	 pulmonary	 fibrosis,	 GI	 involvement,	 and	
cardiac	 disease.	 Scleroderma	 renal	 crisis	 is	 associated	 with	 a	 30%	
3-year	 mortality.	 Lung	 cancer	 and	 excess	 cardiovascular	 deaths	 also	
contribute	to	increased	mortality.	Markers	of	poor	prognosis	include	
male	 gender,	 African-American	 race,	 older	 age	 at	 disease	 onset,	
extensive	 skin	 thickening	 with	 truncal	 involvement,	 palpable	 ten-
don	 friction	 rubs,	 and	 evidence	 of	 significant	 or	 progressive	 visceral	
organ	 involvement.	 Laboratory	 predictors	 of	 increased	 mortality	 at	
initial	 evaluation	 include	 an	 elevated	 ESR,	 anemia,	 proteinuria,	 and	
anti–topoisomerase	 I	 (Scl-70)	 antibodies.	 In	 one	 study,	 SSc	 patients	
with	 extensive	 skin	 involvement,	 lung	 vital	 capacity	 <55%	 predicted,	
significant	 GI	 involvement	 (pseudo-obstruction	 or	 malabsorption),	
clinical	cardiac	involvement,	or	scleroderma	renal	crisis	had	a	9-year	
survival	 <40%.	 The	 severity	 of	 PAH	 predicts	 mortality,	 and	 patients	
with	mean	pulmonary	arterial	pressure	≥45	mmHg	had	a	33%	3-year	
survival.	The	advent	of	ACE	inhibitors	in	scleroderma	renal	crisis	had	a	
dramatic	impact	on	survival,	increasing	survival	from	<10%	at	1	year	in	
the	pre–ACE	inhibitor	era	to	>70%	3-year	survival	at	the	present	time.	
Moreover,	10-year	survival	in	SSc	improved	from	<60%	in	the	1970s	to	
>66–78%	in	the	1990s,	a	trend	that	reflects	both	earlier	detection	and	
better	management	of	complications.

LOCALIZED SCLERODERMA
The	 term	 scleroderma	 describes	 a	 group	 of	 localized	 skin	 disorders	
(Table	 360-1).	 These	 occur	 more	 commonly	 in	 children	 than	 in	
adults	 and,	 in	 marked	 contrast	 to	 SSc,	 are	 generally	 not	 complicated	
by	Raynaud’s	phenomenon	or	significant	internal	organ	involvement.	
Morphea	presents	as	solitary	or	multiple	circular	patches	of	thick	skin	
or,	rarely,	as	widespread	induration	(generalized	or	pansclerotic	mor-
phea);	the	fingers	are	generally	spared.	Linear	scleroderma	may	affect	
subcutaneous	 tissues,	 leading	 to	 fibrosis	 and	 atrophy	 of	 supporting	
structures,	tendons,	muscle,	and	even	bone.	In	children,	the	growth	of	
affected	long	bones	can	be	retarded.	When	linear	scleroderma	crosses	
large	joints,	significant	contractures	can	develop.

MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE
Patients	who	have	lcSSc	coexisting	with	features	of	SLE,	polymyositis,	
and	 rheumatoid	 arthritis	 may	 have	 mixed	 connective	 tissue	 disease	
(MCTD).	 This	 overlap	 syndrome	 is	 generally	 associated	 with	 the	
presence	of	high	titers	of	autoantibodies	to	U1-RNP.	The	characteristic	
initial	 presentation	 is	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 associated	 with	 puffy	
fingers	 and	 myalgia.	 Over	 time,	 sclerodactyly,	 soft-tissue	 calcinosis,	
and	cutaneous	telangiectasia	may	appear.	Skin	rash	suggestive	of	SLE	
(malar	 erythema,	 photosensitivity)	 or	 dermatomyositis	 (heliotrope	
rash	on	the	eyelids,	erythematous	rash	on	knuckles)	occurs.	Arthralgia	
is	 common,	 and	 some	 patients	 develop	 erosive	 polyarthritis.	 Pul-
monary	 fibrosis	 and	 isolated	 or	 secondary	 PAH	 may	 develop.	 Other	
manifestations	 include	 esophageal	 dysmotility,	 pericarditis,	 Sjögren’s	
syndrome,	 and	 renal	 disease,	 especially	 membranous	 glomerulone-
phritis.	Laboratory	evaluation	shows	elevated	ESR	and	hypergamma-
globulinemia.	While	anti-U1RNP	antibodies	are	detected	in	high	titers,	
SSc-specific	autoantibodies	are	absent.	In	contrast	to	SSc,	MCTD	often	

responds	to	glucocorticoids,	and	the	long-term	prognosis	is	better	than	
that	of	SSc.	Whether	MCTD	is	truly	a	distinct	entity	or	is	a	subset	of	
SLE	or	SSc	remains	controversial.

EOSINOPHILIC FASCIITIS (DIFFUSE 
FASCIITIS WITH EOSINOPHILIA)
Eosinophilic	 fasciitis	 is	 a	 rare	 idiopathic	 disorder	 of	 adults	 associ-
ated	 with	 abrupt	 skin	 induration.	 The	 skin	 characteristically	 shows	
a	coarse	cobblestone	“peau	d’orange”	appearance.	In	contrast	to	SSc,	
Raynaud’s	 phenomenon	 and	 SSc-associated	 internal	 organ	 involve-
ment	and	autoantibodies	are	absent.	Furthermore,	skin	involvement	
spares	 the	 fingers.	 Full-thickness	 biopsy	 of	 the	 lesional	 skin	 reveals	
fibrosis	 of	 the	 subcutaneous	 fascia,	 with	 variable	 inflammation	 and	
eosinophil	 infiltration.	 In	 the	 acute	 phase	 of	 the	 illness,	 peripheral	
blood	eosinophilia	may	be	prominent.	MRI	appears	to	be	a	sensitive	
tool	 for	 the	 diagnosis	 of	 eosinophilic	 fasciitis.	 Eosinophilic	 fasciitis	
can	occur	in	association	with,	or	preceding,	various	myelodysplastic	
syndromes	 or	 multiple	 myeloma.	 Although	 glucocorticoids	 cause	
prompt	resolution	of	eosinophilia,	the	skin	shows	slow	and	variable	
improvement.	The	prognosis	of	patients	with	eosinophilic	fasciitis	is	
generally	good.

361 Sjögren’s Syndrome

Haralampos M. Moutsopoulos,  
Clio P. Mavragani

 ■ DEFINITION, INCIDENCE, AND PREVALENCE
Sjögren’s	 syndrome	 is	 a	 prototype	 autoimmune	 disease	 character-
ized	 by	 lymphocytic	 infiltration	 of	 the	 exocrine	 glands	 resulting	 in	
xerostomia,	dry	eyes	(keratoconjunctivitis	sicca),	and	profound	B-cell	
hyperactivity.	The	syndrome	has	unique	features	since	it	presents	with	
a	wide	clinical	spectrum	from	organ-specific	to	systemic	disease;	can	
occur	alone	or	in	association	with	other	systemic	rheumatic	diseases,	
more	 commonly	 rheumatoid	 arthritis,	 limited	 scleroderma,	 and	
systemic	 lupus	 erythematosus;	 and	 displays	 high	 probability	 of	 the	
development	 of	 lymphoma.	 Because	 of	 all	 these	 characteristics,	 it	 is	
an	 ideal	 model	 to	 study	 not	 only	 autoimmunity	 but	 also	 lymphoid		
malignancy.

Middle-aged	 women	 (female-to-male	 ratio	 10-20:1)	 are	 primarily	
affected,	although	Sjögren’s	syndrome	may	occur	at	any	age,	including	
childhood.	Patients	with	earlier	disease	onset	express	a	more	aggres-
sive	 disease	 phenotype	 manifested	 by	 a	 high	 occurrence	 of	 systemic	
manifestations	and	serum	autoantibodies.	The	prevalence	of	Sjögren’s	
syndrome	is	~0.5–1%,	while	5–20%	of	patients	with	other	autoimmune	
diseases	can	express	sicca	manifestations.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS
The	autoimmune	phenomena	observed	in	Sjögren’s	syndrome	include	
lymphocytic	 infiltration	 of	 the	 exocrine	 glands	 (primarily	 salivary	
and	 lachrymal	 glands)	 and	 B	 lymphocyte	 hyperreactivity.	 The	 latter	
is	 mainly	 manifested	 by	 hypergammaglobulinemia	 and	 the	 presence	
of	 serum	 autoantibodies	 toward	 non-organ-specific	 antigens	 such	
as	 immunoglobulins	 (rheumatoid	 factors)	 and	 extractable	 cellular	
antigens	 (Ro52,	 Ro60,	 and	 La).	 The	 major	 infiltrating	 cells	 in	 the	
affected	exocrine	glands	are	activated	T	lymphocytes.	In	labial	minor	
salivary	 gland	 tissues	 with	 extensive	 lymphocytic	 infiltrations,	 B-cell	
populations	prevail.	Other	cellular	subsets	detected	in	the	labial	minor	
salivary	 gland	 histopathologic	 lesion	 of	 Sjogren’s	 syndrome	 include	
follicular,	 myeloid,	 and	 plasmacytoid	 dendritic	 cells,	 as	 well	 as	 mac-
rophages.	 Inflammasome	 activation	 and	 macrophages	 positive	 for	
interleukin	(IL)	18	in	the	salivary	gland	lesion	have	been	shown	to	be	
associated	with	adverse	predictors	for	lymphoma	development.

The	interplay	of	endogenous	(e.g.,	intracellular	stress,	inappropriate	
overexpression	 of	 endogenous	 nucleic	 acids)	 and	 exogenous	 triggers	
(e.g.,	viruses,	hormonal	triggers,	stressful	life	events)	in	a	background	
of	a	genetically	determined	hyperactive	immune	response	seems	to	be	
crucial	for	the	initiation	and	perpetuation	of	the	disease.	Ductal	and	
acinar	epithelial	cells	appear	to	play	a	significant	role	in	the	initiation	
and	perpetuation	of	autoimmune	injury.	These	cells	(1)	express	inap-
propriately	costimulatory	molecules	and	the	intracellular	autoantigens	
Ro	and	La	on	their	cell	surfaces,	acquiring	the	capacity	to	provide	sig-
nals	essential	for	lymphocytic	activation;	(2)	produce	proinflammatory	
cytokines	 and	 lymphocyte-attracting	 chemokines	 necessary	 for	 sus-
taining	the	autoimmune	lesion	and	allowing	the	formation	of	ectopic	
germinal	centers;	(3)	express	functional	receptors	of	innate	immunity,	
particularly	 Toll-like	 receptors	 (TLRs)	 3,	 7,	 and	 9	 molecules,	 which	
may	account	for	the	initiation	of	the	autoimmune	reactivity;	and	(4)	
display	immunoregulatory	molecules	such	as	ICAM	and	CD40.	Glan-
dular	epithelial	cells	also	seem	to	have	an	active	role	in	the	production	
of	B	cell–activating	factor	(BAFF),	which	is	induced	after	stimulation	
with	type	I	and	II	interferons.	Circulating	BAFF	has	been	found	to	be	
elevated	 also	 in	 the	 serum	 of	 Sjögren’s	 syndrome	 patients,	 especially	
those	with	hypergammaglobulinemia	and	serum	autoantibodies,	and	
probably	accounts	for	the	antiapoptotic	effect	on	B	lymphocytes.

In	 contrast	 to	 B	 and	 T	 lymphocytes,	 glandular	 epithelial	 cells	 dis-
play	 increased	 rates	 of	 apoptotic	 death.	 Established	 risk	 genetic	 loci	
implicated	in	Sjögren’s	syndrome	include	the	human	leukocyte	antigen	
DQA1*0501	allele,	as	well	as	variants	involved	in	the	interferon/BAFF	
axis	(IRF 5, STAT 4, BAFF),	B-cell	function	(EBF1, BLK),	and	chronic	
inflammation	(TNFAIP3).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The	 majority	 of	 patients	 with	 Sjögren’s	 syndrome	 have	 symptoms	
related	to	impaired	exocrine	gland,	particularly	lacrimal	and	salivary	
gland,	function.	The	disease	evolution	is	slow	and,	in	the	majority	of	
patients,	runs	a	benign	course.	Studies	have	shown	that	prior	to	disease	
onset,	patients	with	Sjögren’s	syndrome	experience	major	stressful	life	
events	with	which	they	cannot	cope	adequately.

The	principal	oral	symptom	of	Sjögren’s	syndrome	is	dryness	(xeros-
tomia).	 Patients	 report	 difficulty	 in	 swallowing	 dry	 food,	 a	 burning	
mouth	sensation,	an	increase	in	dental	caries,	and	problems	in	wearing	
complete	 dentures.	 Physical	 examination	 shows	 a	 dry,	 erythematous,	
sticky	 oral	 mucosa.	 There	 is	 atrophy	 of	 the	 filiform	 papillae	 on	 the	
dorsum	of	the	tongue,	and	saliva	from	the	major	glands	is	either	not	
expressible	 or	 cloudy.	 Intermittent	 or	 persistent	 enlargement	 of	 the	
parotid	or	other	major	salivary	glands	occurs	in	two-thirds	of	patients	
with	Sjögren’s	syndrome.	Diagnostic	tests	include	sialometry	and	sev-
eral	imaging	techniques,	including	ultrasound,	MRI,	and	magnetic	res-
onance	sialography	of	the	major	salivary	glands.	In	particular,	salivary	
gland	ultrasound	is	an	emerging	tool	of	both	diagnostic	and	prognostic	
utility.	Biopsy	of	the	labial	minor	salivary	gland	allows	histopathologic	
confirmation	of	focal	lymphocytic	infiltrates.

Ocular	 involvement	 is	 the	 other	 major	 manifestation	 of	 Sjögren’s	
syndrome.	 Patients	 usually	 report	 a	 sandy	 or	 gritty	 feeling	 under

of	 secretions	 in	 thick	 strands	 at	 the	 inner	 canthi,	 decreased	 tearing,	
redness,	 itching,	 eye	 fatigue,	 and	 increased	 photosensitivity.	 These	
symptoms	 are	 attributed	 to	 the	 destruction	 of	 corneal	 and	 bulbar	
conjunctival	epithelium,	a	pathology	termed	keratoconjunctivitis sicca.	
Diagnostic	evaluation	of	keratoconjunctivitis	sicca	includes	measure-
ment	 of	 tear	 flow	 by	 Schirmer’s	 I	 test,	 determination	 of	 tear	 compo-
sition	 by	 tear	 breakup	 time	 or	 tear	 lysozyme	 content,	 and	 slit-lamp	
examination	 of	 the	 cornea	 and	 conjunctiva	 after	 lissamine	 green	 or	
Rose	 Bengal	 staining	 that	 reveals	 punctuate	 corneal	 and	 bulbar	 con-
junctival	ulcerations	and	attached	filaments.

Involvement	of	other	exocrine	glands,	which	occurs	less	frequently,	
includes	a	decrease	in	mucous	gland	secretions	of	the	upper	and	lower	
respiratory	 tree,	 resulting	 in	 dry	 nose,	 throat,	 and	 trachea	 (xerotra-
chea).	In	addition,	diminished	secretion	of	the	exocrine	glands	of	the	
gastrointestinal	tract	leads	to	esophageal	mucosal	dysmotility	and	atro-
phic	gastritis.	Dyspareunia,	in	premenopausal	women,	due	to	dryness	
of	the	external	genitalia	and	dry	skin	also	may	occur.

Extraglandular	 (systemic)	 manifestations	 are	 seen	 in	 one-third	 of	
patients	with	Sjögren’s	syndrome	(Table 361-1)	and	can	be	classified	as	
follows:	 nonspecific,	 periepithelial	 (surrounding	 of	 epithelial	 tissues	
by	lymphocytes),	immune complex–mediated,	and	lymphoma.	Non-
specific	manifestations	include	fatigability,	low-grade	fever,	Raynaud’s	
phenomenon,	myalgias,	arthralgias,	and	arthritis.	Arthritis	in	patients	
with	primary	Sjögren’s	syndrome	is	nonerosive.	Periepithelial	pathol-
ogy	due	to	periepithelial	accumulation	of	lymphocytes	results	from	the	
involvement	 of	 parenchymal	 organs	 such	 as	 the	 lungs,	 kidneys,	 and	
liver.	On	the	basis	of	this	observation,	one	of	the	authors	(H.M.M.)	has	
coined	the	term	autoimmune epithelitis.	Lung	involvement	is	usually	
manifested	 with	 dry	 cough	 and	 rarely	 with	 dyspnea.	 The	 underlying	
lung	 pathology	 includes	 peribronchial	 infiltrates	 (bronchitis	 sicca)	
and	 interstitial	 pneumonitis.	 Renal	 involvement	 includes	 interstitial	
nephritis,	clinically	manifested	by	hyposthenuria	and	renal	tubular	dys-
function	with	or	without	acidosis.	Untreated	acidosis	may	lead	to	neph-
rocalcinosis.	 Immune  complex–mediated	 disease	 is	 expressed	 with	
vasculitis	 affecting	 primarily	 small-sized	 vessels,	 mainly	 manifested	
with	purpura	and	rarely	with	urticarial	rash,	skin	ulcerations,	monon-

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disordersassociated	with	mixed	type	II	or	III	cryoglobulinemia.	Central	nervous	
system	involvement	is	rarely	recognized.	A	few	cases	of	myelitis	associ-
ated	with	antibodies	to	aquaporin	4	have	been	described.

Sjögren’s	 syndrome	 is	 characterized	 by	 the	 highest	 risk	 for	 lym-
phoma	 development	 among	 all	 autoimmune	 diseases.	 Tongue	 atro-
phy,	 persistent	 parotid	 gland	 enlargement,	 purpura,	 mixed	 type	 II	
cryoglobulinemia,	 low	 serum	 C4	 complement	 levels,	 autoantibodies	
(rheumatoid	 factor,	 anti-Ro52,	 anti-Ro60,	 anti-La),	 and	 extensive	
lymphocytic	infiltration	in	minor	salivary	glands	are	among	the	main	
features	 predicting	 the	 development	 of	 lymphoma.	 Most	 lympho-
mas	 are	 extranodal,	 low-grade,	 marginal	 zone	 B	 cell	 and	 are	 usually	
detected	 incidentally	 during	 evaluation	 of	 the	 labial	 minor	 salivary	
gland	biopsy.	The	affected	lymph	nodes	are	usually	peripheral.	Survival	
rates	 are	 decreased	 in	 patients	 with	 B	 symptoms,	 lymph	 node	 mass		
>7	cm	in	diameter,	and	high	or	intermediate	histologic	grade.	Despite	
that,	 pathogenesis	 of	 lymphoma	 in	 the	 setting	 of	 Sjögren’s	 syndrome	
remains	 to	 be	 elucidated,	 and	 genetic	 alterations	 involved	 in	 chronic	
inflammatory,	 B-cell	 activation	 and	 the	 type	 I	 interferon	 pathways,	
as	well	as	epigenetic	abnormalities,	have	been	shown	to	be	significant	
contributors.

Recent	 data	 reveal	 an	 increased	 risk	 for	 multiple	 myeloma	 as	 well	
for	Sjögren’s	syndrome	patients	with	anti-Ro52,	anti-Ro60,	or	anti-La	
autoantibodies.	In	line	with	observations	in	rheumatoid	arthritis	and	
systemic	 lupus	 erythematosus,	 patients	 with	 Sjögren’s	 syndrome	 also	
display	an	increased	risk	of	cardiovascular	disease.

Routine	laboratory	tests	in	Sjögren’s	syndrome	can	reveal	leukope-
nia	and	infrequently	lymphopenia.	In	two-thirds	of	patients,	elevated	
erythrocyte	sedimentation	rate,	hypergammaglobulinemia,	antinuclear	
antibodies,	 rheumatoid	 factors,	 and	 antibodies	 against	 Ro52/Ro60	
and	La	autoantigens	are	detected.	Anticentromere	autoantibodies	are	
present	 in	 Sjögren’s	 patients	 with	 a	 clinical	 picture	 similar	 to	 that	 of	
limited	scleroderma	(Chap. 360),	while	the	presence	of	antimitochon-
drial	 antibodies	 may	 connote	 liver	 involvement	 in	 the	 form	 of	 auto-
immune	 cholangitis	 (Chap.  346).	 Autoantibodies	 to	 21-hydroxylase	
are	found	in	patients	with	a	blunted	adrenal	response,	while	autoan-
tibodies	 to	 citrullinated	 peptides	 are	 seen	 in	 Sjögren’s	 patients	 with

the	occurrence	of	peripheral	neuropathies.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Sjögren’s	syndrome	should	be	suspected	if	a	patient	presents	with	eye	
and/or	mouth	dryness,	major	salivary	gland	enlargement,	or	systemic	
manifestations	such	as	Raynaud’s	phenomenon,	palpable	purpura,	or	
symptomatology	of	renal	tubular	acidosis.	A	careful	history	of	medica-
tions	causing	dryness	should	be	obtained.	Recently,	cases	of	Sjögren’s	
syndrome	were	triggered	by	PD-1/PD-L1	checkpoint	inhibitors.

The	workup	should	include	eye	tests	that	might	reveal	keratoconjunc-
tivitis	sicca,	salivary	flow	tests	or	ultrasonography,	and	serum	evaluation	
for	specific	autoantibodies.	Testing	for	chronic	viral	infections	(hepatitis	
C	virus,	HIV),	chest	x-ray	to	rule	out	sarcoidosis,	protein	electrophore-
sis,	IgG4	serum	levels,	and	autoantibodies	to	thyroid	antigens	can	be	also	
offered.	Labial	biopsy	is	valuable	to	rule	out	conditions	that	may	cause	
dry	mouth,	dry	eyes,	or	parotid	gland	enlargement	(Tables 361-2 and 
361-3).	Classification	criteria	are	not	valuable	for	everyday	practice	but	
are	of	paramount	importance	for	research.	A	diagnostic	algorithm	based	
on	recent	classification	criteria	is	presented	(Fig. 361-1).

TREATMENT
Sjögren’s Syndrome

Treatment	 of	 Sjögren’s	 syndrome	 aims	 to	 relieve	 symptoms	 and	
limit	the	damage	from	chronic	xerostomia	and	keratoconjunctivitis	
sicca	through	substitution	or	stimulation	of	impaired	secretions.

To	 replace	 deficient	 tears,	 several	 ophthalmic	 preparations	 are	
readily	 available	 (hydroxypropyl	 methylcellulose;	 polyvinyl	 alco-
hol;	 0.5%	 methylcellulose;	 Hypo	 Tears).	 If	 corneal	 ulcerations	 are	
present,	eye	patching	and	boric	acid	ointments	are	recommended,	
as	well	as	cyclosporine	eye	drops.	Certain	drugs	that	may	decrease	
lacrimal	and	salivary	secretions,	such	as	diuretics,	antihypertensive	
drugs,	anticholinergics,	and	antidepressants,	should	be	avoided.

For	xerostomia,	the	best	replacement	is	water.	Propionic	acid	gels	
may	be	used	to	treat	vaginal	dryness.	To	stimulate	secretions,	orally	
administered	pilocarpine	(5	mg	thrice	daily)	or	cevimeline	(30	mg	
thrice	daily)	appears	to	improve	sicca	manifestations,	and	both	are	
well	 tolerated.	 Hydroxychloroquine	 (200	 mg	 daily)	 is	 helpful	 for	
arthralgias	and	mild	arthritis.

Patients	with	renal	tubular	acidosis	should	receive	sodium	bicar-
bonate	by	mouth	(0.5–2	mmol/kg	in	four	divided	doses).	Glucocor-
ticoids	and	monoclonal	antibody	to	CD20	(rituximab)	appear	to	be	
effective	in	patients	with	systemic	disease,	particularly	in	those	with	
purpura	 and	 arthritis.	 Novel	 monoclonal	 antibodies	 targeting	 the	
CD40L/CD40	costimulatory	pathway	or	the	BAFF	receptor	seem	to	
be	promising	therapeutic	strategies	for	the	management	of	Sjögren’s	
syndrome	patients	with	systemic	manifestations.	Treatment	of	lym-
phoma	 in	 the	 setting	 of	 Sjögren’s	 syndrome	 follows	 the	 general	
guidelines	for	lymphoma	management	in	the	general	population.

362 Spondyloarthritis

Joel D. Taurog, Lianne S. Gensler,  
Nigil Haroon

Spondyloarthritis	(SpA)	refers	to	a	group	of	overlapping	disorders	that	
share	 clinical	 features,	 genetic	 associations,	 and	 pathogenic	 mecha-
nisms.	 The	 classic	 designations	 include	 ankylosing	 spondylitis	 (AS),	
reactive	 arthritis	 (ReA),	 psoriatic	 arthritis	 (PsA),	 arthritis	 associated	
with	 inflammatory	 bowel	 disease	 (IBD),	 juvenile	 spondyloarthritis	
(JSpA),	and	undifferentiated	SpA.	These	disorders	are	broadly	classified	

as	 predominantly	 axial	 SpA,	 affecting	 the	 spine,	 pelvis,	 and	 thoracic	
cage,	or	predominantly	peripheral	SpA,	affecting	the	extremities.

ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS AND AXIAL 
SPONDYLOARTHRITIS
Axial	 spondyloarthritis	 (axSpA)	 is	 the	 current	 term	 used	 to	 describe	
the	most	common	inflammatory	disorder	affecting	the	axial	skeleton,	
with	variable	involvement	of	peripheral	joints	and	extraarticular	struc-
tures.	 AxSpA	 includes	 patients	 with	 significant	 radiographic	 damage	
of	 the	 sacroiliac	 joints,	 classically	 termed	 AS	 and	 now	 considered	
radiographic	 axial	 spondyloarthritis	 (r-axSpA),	 and	 those	 patients	
with	a	similar	clinical	presentation	but	lacking	significant	radiographic	
sacroiliitis.	 In	 this	 latter	 group,	 some	 eventually	 develop	 significant	
radiographic	 sacroiliitis;	 however,	 many	 do	 not.	 The	 general	 concept	
of	axSpA	is	supported	by	classification	criteria	formulated	in	2009	
(Table 362-1).	AxSpA	patients	with	sacroiliitis	on	MRI	without	signifi-
cant	damage	on	x-ray	are	categorized	as	having	nonradiographic	axial	
spondyloarthritis	(nr-axSpA).

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
The	estimated	adult	prevalence	of	AS	in	20	countries	during	the	past	
2	 decades	 is	 ~0.17%	 (range	 0.02–0.5%).	 In	 the	 few	 studies	 that	 have	
addressed	ax-SpA,	prevalence	is	~1.3-	to	2-fold	higher	than	that	of	AS.	
AS	 shows	 a	 striking	 correlation	 with	 the	 histocompatibility	 antigen	
HLA-B27	and	occurs	worldwide	roughly	in	proportion	to	the	preva-
lence	of	B27.	In	North	American	whites,	the	prevalence	of	B27	is	6%,	
whereas	it	is	80–90%	in	patients	with	AS.

In	population	surveys,	AS	is	found	in	1–6%	of	adults	inheriting	B27,	
whereas	the	prevalence	is	10–30%	among	B27+	adult	first-degree	rela-
tives	of	AS	probands.	The	concordance	rate	in	identical	twins	is	about	
65%.	Susceptibility	to	AS	is	determined	largely	by	genetic	factors,	with	
B27	 comprising	 ~20%	 of	 the	 genetic	 component.	 Single-nucleotide	
polymorphism	(SNP)	analysis	has	identified	115	additional	non-HLA	
alleles	 that	 altogether	 contribute	 another	 ~7–8%	 of	 genetic	 suscep-
tibility.	 The	 prevalence	 of	 HLA-B27	 in	 nr-axSpA	 is	 somewhat	 lower	
than	in	AS	and	the	proportion	of	females	is	higher.	Little	information	
is	 available	 about	 non-HLA	 susceptibility	 loci	 in	 nr-axSpA,	 which	 is	
genetically	more	heterogeneous	than	AS.

 ■ PATHOLOGY
Sacroiliitis	 is	 typically	 an	 early	 manifestation	 of	 axSpA,	 whether	 or	
not	 it	 is	 evident	 radiographically.	 In	 biopsy	 and	 autopsy	 studies	 of	
sacroiliac	 joints,	 covering	 a	 range	 of	 disease	 durations,	 synovitis	 and	
myxoid	 marrow	 represent	 the	 earliest	 changes,	 followed	 by	 pannus	
and	 subchondral	 granulation	 tissue.	 Marrow	 edema,	 enthesitis,	 and	
chondroid	differentiation	are	also	found.	Macrophages,	T	cells,	plasma	
cells,	and	osteoclasts	are	prevalent.	If	the	process	progresses,	eventually	
the	 eroded	 joint	 margins	 are	 replaced	 by	 fibrocartilage	 regeneration	
and	then	by	ossification.

In	 the	 spine,	 inflammatory	 granulation	 tissue	 is	 seen	 in	 the	 par-
avertebral	 connective	 tissue	 at	 the	 junction	 of	 annulus	 fibrosus	 and	
vertebral	 bone,	 or	 even	 along	 the	 entire	 outer	 annulus.	 The	 outer	
annular	fibers	are	eroded	and	eventually	replaced	by	bone,	forming	an	
early	syndesmophyte,	which	then	grows	by	endochondral	ossification,	
ultimately	 bridging	 the	 adjacent	 vertebral	 bodies	 (Fig.  362-1F,  G).	
Progression	of	this	process	can	lead	to	“bamboo	spine.”	Other	spinal	
lesions	include	osteoporosis	(loss	of	trabecular	bone	despite	accretion	
of	periosteal	bone),	erosion	of	vertebral	bodies	at	the	disk	margin,	and	
inflammation	and	destruction	of	the	disk-bone	border.	Inflammatory	
arthritis	of	the	facet	joints	is	common,	with	erosion	of	joint	cartilage	by	
pannus	often	followed	by	bony	ankylosis.	This	may	precede	formation	
of	syndesmophytes	bridging	the	adjacent	disks.	Bone	mineral	density	is	
diminished	in	the	spine	and	proximal	femur	early	in	the	disease	course.
Peripheral	synovitis	in	AS	shows	marked	vascularity,	evident	as	tor-
tuous	 macrovascularity	 seen	 during	 arthroscopy.	 Lining	 layer	 hyper-
plasia,	 lymphoid	 infiltration,	 and	 pannus	 formation	 are	 also	 found.	
Central	cartilaginous	erosions	from	proliferation	of	subchondral	gran-
ulation	tissue	are	common.	The	characteristics	of	peripheral	arthritis	in	
AS	are	shared	by	other	forms	of	SpA	and	are	distinct	from	those	of	RA.
Extensive	 investigation	 has	 implicated	 the	 enthesis,	 the	 fibrocarti-
laginous	region	where	a	tendon,	ligament,	or	joint	capsule	attaches	to	
bone,	as	a	primary	site	of	pathology	in	AS	and	other	SpAs,	at	both	axial	
and	peripheral	sites.	Entheses	transduce	mechanical	forces	from	mus-
cles	to	bones	and	hence	are	widely	distributed	anatomically.	Enthesitis

is	 associated	 with	 prominent	 edema	 of	 the	 adjacent	 bone	 marrow	
and	 is	 often	 characterized	 by	 erosive	 lesions	 that	 eventually	 undergo	
ossification.

Subclinical	 intestinal	 inflammation	 has	 been	 found	 in	 the	 colon	
or	distal	ileum	in	most	patients	with	SpA.	The	histology	is	described	
below	under	“IBD-Associated	Arthritis.”
 ■ PATHOGENESIS
AS	is	immune-mediated,	and	increasing	evidence	suggests	more	of	an	
autoinflammatory	rather	than	antigen-specific	autoimmune	pathogen-
esis.	Uncertainty	remains	regarding	the	primary	site	of	disease	initia-
tion.	The	dramatic	response	of	the	disease	to	therapeutic	blockade	of	
tumor	necrosis	factor	(TNF)	or	IL-17A	indicates	that	these	cytokines	
play	a	central	immunopathogenic	role.	Genes	related	to	TNF	pathways	
show	association	with	AS,	including	TNFRSF1A,	TNFAIP3, LTBR,	and	
TBKBP1.	 Genes	 in	 the	 IL-23/IL-17	 pathway	 show	 association	 with	
AS,	including	IL23R,	PTER4,	IL12B,	CARD9,	IL6R,	TYK2, JAK2,	and	
STAT3.	Of	these	12	genes,	11	are	also	associated	with	IBD,	and	6	with	
psoriasis.	Serum	levels	of	IL-23	and	IL-17	are	elevated	in	AS	patients.	
In	mice,	tissue-resident	thymus-dependent	T	cells	expressing	γ/δ	T-cell	
receptors	and	IL-23	receptors	are	found	at	entheses,	in	the	aortic	root,	
and	near	the	ciliary	body	in	the	eye.	These	cells	express	abundant	IL-17	
and	IL-22	upon	exposure	to	systemic	IL-23.	This	finding	suggests	that	
site-specific	 innate	 immune	 cells	 play	 a	 critical	 role	 in	 the	 anatomic	
specificity	of	these	lesions.	IL-23	signals	through	the	Janus	kinase	(Jak)	
TYK2.	TYK2	loss	of	function	SNPs	are	protective	against	AS,	and	Tyk2	
inhibition	blocks	IL-23-dependent	immunity	and	SpA	progression	in	
a	mouse	model.

High	levels	of	circulating	γδ	T	cells	expressing	IL-23	receptors	and	
producing	 IL-17	 have	 been	 found	 in	 AS	 patients.	 Recent	 studies	 of	
human	 spinal	 entheses	 identified	 IL-23-producing	 CD14+	 myeloid	
cells	and	IL-17A-producing	γδ-T	cells.	One	subset	of	these	γδ-T	cells	
lacked	 IL-23	 receptors.	 This	 population	 evidently	 produces	 IL-17A	
independently	 of	 IL-23	 and	 may	 explain	 the	 therapeutic	 failure	 in	
ax-SpA	 of	 agents	 targeting	 IL-23,	 despite	 the	 positive	 response	 of	
peripheral	SpA	to	these	agents	and	the	dramatic	response	of	both	axial	
and	peripheral	SpA	to	agents	targeting	IL-17A	(see Fig. 362-3).

Other	associated	genes	encode	other	cytokines	or	cytokine	receptors	
(IL1R1,	IL1R2,	IL7R,	IL27),	transcription	factors	involved	in	the	differ-
entiation	of	immune	cells	(RUNX3,	EOMES,	BACH2,	NKX2-3,	TBX21),	
or	other	molecules	involved	in	activation	or	regulation	of	immune	or	
inflammatory	responses	(FCGR2A,	ZMIZ1,	NOS2,	ICOSLG).

The	 inflamed	 sacroiliac	 joint	 is	 infiltrated	 with	 CD4+	 and	 CD8+	
T	 cells	 and	 macrophages	 and	 shows	 high	 levels	 of	 TNF,	 particularly	
early	in	the	disease.	Abundant	transforming	growth	factor	β	(TGF-β)	
is	found	in	more	advanced	lesions.	Peripheral	synovitis	in	SpA	is	char-
acterized	 by	 neutrophils,	 macrophages	 expressing	 CD68	 and	 CD163,	
CD4+	and	CD8+	T	cells,	and	B	cells.	There	is	prominent	staining	for	
intercellular	 adhesion	 molecule	 1	 (ICAM-1),	 vascular	 cell	 adhesion	
molecule	 1	 (VCAM-1),	 matrix	 metalloproteinase	 3	 (MMP-3),	 and	
myeloid-related	proteins	8	and	14	(MRP-8	and	MRP-14).

Gut	microbiota	dysbiosis	is	consistently	found	in	SpA	patients	and	
animal	 models,	 and	 in	 both	 may	 be	 influenced	 by	 HLA	 genotype,	
including	 HLA-B27.	 Bacteria	 species	 with	 mucolytic	 properties	 are	
expanded	in	patients,	suggesting	a	pathogenic	role	for	degradation	of	
intestinal	mucus.	Overlapping	features	with	ReA	and	IBD	and	involve-
ment	 of	 the	 IL-23/IL-17	 pathway,	 which	 is	 fundamentally	 associated	
with	 host	 defense	 at	 mucosal	 sites,	 provide	 additional	 support	 for	
the	 importance	 of	 the	 microbiome	 in	 SpA	 pathogenesis.	 It	 has	 been	
hypothesized	 that	 systemic	 inflammation,	 dysbiosis,	 and	 increased	
intestinal	 permeability	 form	 an	 amplification	 loop	 driving	 sustained	
inflammation	in	SpA.

HLA-B27	 plays	 a	 direct	 role	 in	 AS	 pathogenesis,	 but	 its	 precise	
molecular	 role	 remains	 unresolved.	 Rats	 transgenic	 for	 HLA-B27	
develop	arthritis	and	spondylitis,	and	this	is	unaffected	by	the	absence	
of	CD8.	It	thus	appears	that	classical	peptide	antigen	presentation	to	
CD8+	T	cells	may	not	be	the	primary	disease	mechanism.	However,	the	
association	of	AS	with	ERAP1	and	ERAP2,	which	strongly	influence	
the	 MHC	 class	 I	 peptide	 repertoire,	 suggests	 that	 peptide	 binding	 to

B27	is	nonetheless	important.	CD8+	T	cells	are	decreased	in	periph-
eral	 blood	 and	 increased	 in	 synovial	 fluid	 in	 AS	 patients,	 but	 their	
role	in	AS	pathogenesis	remains	unclear.	The	B27	heavy	chain	has	an	
unusual	tendency	to	misfold,	a	process	that	can	be	proinflammatory.	
Genetic	 and	 functional	 studies	 in	 humans	 have	 suggested	 a	 role	 for	
natural	killer	(NK)	cells	in	AS,	possibly	through	interaction	with	B27	
heavy	 chain	 homodimers.	 SpA-prone	 B27	 rats	 show	 defective	 den-
dritic	cell	function	and	share	with	AS	patients	a	characteristic	“reverse	
interferon”	 gene	 expression	 signature	 in	 antigen-presenting	 cells.	 A	
recent	 study	 provided	 evidence	 for	 an	 interaction	 between	 HLA-B27	
and	activin	receptor-like	kinase-2,	a	bone	morphogenic	protein	family	
member,	mutations	of	which	are	associated	with	fibrodysplasia	ossifi-
cans	progressiva,	a	disease	of	uncontrolled	bone	formation.

Enthesitis	can	arise	in	healthy	individuals	from	repetitive	mechan-
ical	strain	at	a	particular	anatomic	site.	In	SpA,	it	is	thought	that	the	
threshold	 for	 strain-induced	 entheseal	 inflammation	 is	 lowered	 by	
genetic	 factors	 and/or	 microbial	 products,	 resulting	 in	 widespread,	
chronic	lesions	arising	at	entheseal	sites	subjected	only	to	normal	use.	
Supporting	 this	 concept,	 mice	 transgenic	 for	 constitutive	 TNF	 pro-
duction	develop	peripheral	enthesitis	and	arthritis	mediated	by	innate	
immunity,	and	nonweightbearing	reduces	inflammation	and	new	bone	
formation	at	these	sites.

New	bone	formation	in	AS	appears	to	be	largely	based	on	enchon-
dral	bone	formation	and	occurs	only	in	the	periosteal	compartment.	It	
correlates	with	lack	of	regulation	of	the	Wnt	signaling	pathway,	which	

controls	the	differentiation	of	mesenchymal	cells	into	osteophytes,	by	
the	inhibitors	DKK-1	and	sclerostin.	Indirect	evidence	and	data	from	
animal	 models	 also	 implicate	 bone	 morphogenic	 proteins,	 hedgehog	
proteins,	and	prostaglandin	E2.	Patients	with	high	inflammatory	mark-
ers	and	inflammation	at	vertebral	corners	on	MRI	are	the	ones	most	
likely	 to	 develop	 syndesmophytes.	 Mounting	 evidence	 suggests	 that	
early	and	prolonged	anti-TNF	therapy	may	decrease	spinal	fusion.	Ver-
tebral	inflammatory	lesions	that	undergo	metaplasia	to	fat	(increased	
T1-weighted	 signal)	 are	 a	 preferential	 site	 of	 subsequent	 syndesmo-
phyte	formation	despite	anti-TNF	therapy,	whereas	early	acute	inflam-
matory	lesions	resolve,	reinforcing	the	importance	of	early	treatment	
to	resolve	inflammation.

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The	initial	AS	symptoms	are	usually	first	noticed	in	late	adolescence	or	
early	adulthood,	at	a	median	age	in	the	mid-twenties.	In	5%	of	patients,	
symptoms	begin	after	age	40.	The	initial	symptom	is	pain	that	can	be	
either	sharp	or	dull,	insidious	in	onset,	felt	deep	in	the	lower	lumbar	
or	gluteal	region,	and	accompanied	by	low-back	morning	stiffness	of	
up	 to	 a	 few	 hours’	 duration	 that	 improves	 with	 activity	 and	 returns	
following	 inactivity.	 Within	 a	 few	 months,	 the	 pain	 usually	 becomes	
persistent	and	bilateral.	Nocturnal	exacerbation	of	pain	often	forces	the	
patient	to	rise	and	move	around.

In	some	patients,	bony	tenderness	(presumably	reflecting	enthesitis	
or	osteitis)	accompanies	back	pain	or	stiffness,	whereas	in	others	it	may

be	the	predominant	complaint.	Common	sites	include	the	costosternal	
junctions,	 spinous	 processes,	 iliac	 crests,	 greater	 trochanters,	 ischial	
tuberosities,	tibial	tubercles,	and	heels.	Hip	and	shoulder	(“root”	joint)	
arthritis	 is	 considered	 part	 of	 axial	 disease.	 Hip	 arthritis	 occurs	 in	
25–35%	of	patients.	Severe	isolated	hip	arthritis	or	bony	chest	pain	may	
be	the	presenting	complaint,	and	symptomatic	hip	disease	can	domi-
nate	the	clinical	picture,	especially	in	those	with	juvenile-onset	disease.	
Arthritis	 of	 peripheral	 joints	 is	 usually	 asymmetric	 and	 may	 occur	 at	
any	point	in	the	disease	course.	Neck	pain	and	stiffness	from	cervical	
spine	 involvement	 may	 be	 later	 manifestations	 but	 are	 occasionally	
dominant	symptoms.	Chest	pain	is	common	at	any	stage	of	ax-SpA	and	
if	not	accurately	diagnosed	can	be	confused	with	cardiovascular	disease.
In	 juvenile	 spondyloarthritis,	 peripheral	 arthritis	 and	 enthesitis	

predominate,	with	axial	symptoms	supervening	in	late	adolescence.

Initially,	 axial	 physical	 findings	 mirror	 the	 inflammatory	 process.	
The	most	specific	findings	involve	loss	of	spinal	mobility,	with	limita-
tion	of	anterior	and	lateral	flexion	and	extension	of	the	lumbar	spine	
and	of	chest	expansion.	Limitation	of	motion	is	usually	out	of	propor-
tion	 to	 the	 degree	 of	 bony	 ankylosis	 and	 may	 reflect	 muscle	 spasm	
secondary	to	pain	and	inflammation.	Pain	in	the	sacroiliac	joints	may	
be	 elicited	 either	 with	 direct	 pressure	 or	 with	 stress	 on	 the	 joints.	 In	
addition,	there	is	commonly	tenderness	upon	palpation	of	the	poste-
rior	spinous	processes	and	other	sites	of	symptomatic	bony	tenderness.
The	modified	Schober	test	is	a	useful	measure	of	lumbar	spine	flex-
ion.	The	patient	stands	erect,	with	heels	together,	and	marks	are	made	
on	the	spine	at	the	lumbosacral	junction	(identified	by	a	horizontal	line	
between	the	posterosuperior	iliac	spines)	and	10	cm	above.	The	patient	
then	 bends	 forward	 maximally	 with	 knees	 fully	 extended,	 and	 the	
distance	between	the	two	marks	is	measured.	This	distance	increases	
by	≥2	cm	with	normal	mobility.	Chest	expansion	is	measured	as	the	
difference	between	maximal	inspiration	and	maximal	forced	expiration	
at	the	levels	of	either	the	fourth	intercostal	space	or	the	xiphisternum,	
with	 the	 patient’s	 hands	 resting	 on	 or	 just	 behind	 the	 head.	 Normal	
chest	 expansion	 is	 ≥2.5	 cm.	 Lateral	 bending	 measures	 the	 distance	
the	 patient’s	 middle	 finger	 travels	 down	 the	 leg	 with	 maximal	 lateral	
bending.	Normal	is	>10	cm.

Limitation	or	pain	with	motion	of	the	hips	or	shoulders	is	usually	
present	 if	 these	 joints	 are	 involved.	 It	 should	 be	 emphasized	 that	 in	
early,	 mild,	 or	 atypical	 cases,	 the	 symptoms	 and/or	 physical	 findings	
may	be	subtle	and/or	nonspecific.

The	course	of	ax-SpA	is	extremely	variable,	ranging	from	the	indi-
vidual	with	mild	stiffness	and	normal	radiographs	to	the	patient	with	
a	totally	fused	spine	and	severe	bilateral	hip	arthritis,	severe	peripheral	
arthritis,	 and	 extraarticular	 manifestations.	 Available	 data	 on	 natu-
ral	 history	 pertain	 predominantly	 to	 AS,	 although	 the	 prevalence	 of	
peripheral	arthritis,	enthesitis,	psoriasis,	and	IBD	appears	to	be	similar	
in	 nr-axSpA	 and	 AS.	 Pain	 tends	 to	 be	 persistent	 early	 in	 the	 disease	
and	 intermittent	 later,	 with	 alternating	 exacerbations	 and	 quiescent	
periods.	 In	 a	 typical	 severe	 untreated	 case	 with	 progression	 to	 syn-
desmophyte	formation,	the	posture	undergoes	characteristic	changes,	
with	 obliterated	 lumbar	 lordosis,	 buttock	 atrophy,	 and	 accentuated	
thoracic	kyphosis.	There	may	be	a	forward	stoop	of	the	neck	or	flexion	
contractures	at	the	hips,	compensated	by	flexion	at	the	knees.	Disease	
progression	can	be	estimated	clinically	from	loss	of	height,	limitation	
of	chest	expansion	and	spinal	flexion,	and	increasing	occiput-to-wall	
distance.	Occasional	individuals	are	encountered	with	advanced	defor-
mities	who	deny	ever	having	significant	symptoms.

The	factors	most	predictive	of	radiographic	progression	(see	below)	
are	the	presence	of	existing	syndesmophytes,	high	inflammatory	mark-
ers,	and	smoking.	In	some	but	not	all	studies,	onset	of	AS	in	adoles-
cence	and	early	hip	involvement	correlate	with	a	worse	prognosis.	In	
women,	AS	tends	to	progress	less	frequently	to	total	spinal	ankylosis,	
although	there	may	be	an	increased	prevalence	of	peripheral	arthritis.	
Peripheral	 arthritis	 occurs	 in	 up	 to	 30%	 of	 patients.	 Pregnancy	 has	
no	consistent	effect	on	AS,	with	symptoms	improving,	remaining	the	
same,	or	deteriorating	in	one-third	of	pregnant	patients,	respectively.	
However,	those	requiring	biologic	therapy	before	pregnancy	are	quite	
likely	to	flare	during	the	second	and	third	trimester	if	the	medication	
is	discontinued	during	pregnancy.

The	 most	 serious	 complication	 of	 advanced	 spinal	 disease	 is	 spinal	
fracture,	which	can	occur	with	even	minor	trauma	to	the	rigid,	osteopo-
rotic	spine.	The	lower	cervical	spine	is	most	commonly	involved.	These	
fractures	are	often	displaced,	causing	spinal	cord	injury.	A	recent	survey	
suggested	a	>10%	lifetime	risk	of	fracture.	Occasionally,	fracture	through	
a	 diskovertebral	 junction	 and	 adjacent	 neural	 arch,	 termed	 pseudoar-
throsis,	most	common	in	the	thoracolumbar	spine,	can	be	an	unrecog-
nized	source	of	persistent	localized	pain	and/or	neurologic	dysfunction.	
Wedging	of	thoracic	vertebrae	can	lead	to	accentuated	kyphosis.

The	 most	 common	 extraarticular	 manifestation	 is	 acute	 anterior	
uveitis,	 which	 occurs	 in	 up	 to	 50%	 of	 patients	 and	 can	 antedate	 the	
spondylitis.	Attacks	are	typically	unilateral,	causing	pain,	photophobia,	
and	 pain	 with	 accommodation.	 These	 may	 recur,	 often	 in	 the	 oppo-
site	eye.	Cataracts	and	secondary	glaucoma	may	ensue.	Up	to	60%	of	
patients	with	AS	have	inflammation	in	the	colon	or	ileum.	This	is	usu-
ally	asymptomatic,	but	overt	IBD	occurs	in	5–10%	of	patients	with	AS	
(see	“IBD-Associated	Arthritis,”	below).	About	10%	of	patients	meeting	
criteria	for	AS	have	psoriasis	(see	“Psoriatic	Arthritis,”	below).	Occa-
sional	patients	are	seen	with	AS	in	association	with	skin	manifestations	
seen	 in	 SAPHO	 syndrome	 (see	 below),	 such	 as	 acne	 fulminans	 or	
hidradenitis	suppurativa.	There	is	an	apparently	increased	risk	of	ische-
mic	heart	disease.	Aortic	insufficiency	occurs	in	a	small	percentage	of	
patients,	usually	after	longstanding	disease.	Third-degree	heart	block	
may	occur	alone	or	together	with	aortic	insufficiency,	and	association	
with	 lesser	 degrees	 of	 heart	 block	 has	 been	 described.	 Cauda	 equina	
syndrome	 and	 upper	 pulmonary	 lobe	 fibrosis	 are	 rare	 late	 complica-
tions.	 Prostatitis	 has	 been	 reported	 to	 have	 an	 increased	 prevalence.	
Amyloidosis	is	rare	(Chap. 112).

Several	 validated	 measures	 of	 disease	 activity	 and	 functional	 out-
come	are	in	widespread	use	in	the	study	and	management	of	ax-SpA,	
particularly	 the	 Bath	 Ankylosing	 Spondylitis	 Disease	 Activity	 Index	
(BASDAI)	 and	 the	 Ankylosing	 Spondylitis	 Disease	 Activity	 Score	
(ASDAS),	both	measures	of	disease	activity;	the	Bath	Ankylosing	Spon-
dylitis	Functional	Index	(BASFI),	a	measure	of	limitation	in	activities	
of	daily	living;	and	several	measures	of	radiographic	changes.	The	new	
Assessment	of	Spondyloarthritis	international	Society	(ASAS)	Health	
Index	 is	 a	 spondyloarthritis-specfic	 tool	 for	 assessing	 impairment	 of	
function	and	health.	Despite	persistence	of	the	disease,	most	patients	
remain	gainfully	employed.	Some	but	not	all	studies	of	survival	in	AS	
have	suggested	that	AS	shortens	life	span,	compared	with	the	general	
population.	Mortality	attributable	to	AS	is	largely	the	result	of	spinal	
trauma,	aortic	insufficiency,	respiratory	failure,	amyloid	nephropathy,	
or	complications	of	therapy	such	as	upper	gastrointestinal	hemorrhage.	
The	 impact	 of	 biologic	 therapy	 on	 outcome	 and	 mortality	 is	 not	 yet	
known,	except	for	significantly	improved	work	productivity.

 ■ LABORATORY FINDINGS
No	laboratory	test	is	diagnostic	of	AS.	In	most	ethnic	groups,	HLA-B27	
is	present	in	75–90%	of	patients.	Erythrocyte	sedimentation	rate	(ESR)	
and	C-reactive	protein	(CRP)	are	often,	but	not	always,	elevated.	Mild	
anemia	may	be	present.	Patients	with	severe	disease	may	show	elevated	
alkaline	phosphatase.	Elevated	serum	IgA	is	common.	Rheumatoid	fac-
tor,	 anti-cyclic	 citrullinated	 peptide	 (CCP),	 and	 antinuclear	 antibodies	
(ANAs)	are	largely	absent	unless	caused	by	a	coexistent	disease,	although	
ANAs	 may	 appear	 with	 anti-TNF	 therapy.	 Circulating	 levels	 of	 CD8+		
T	cells	tend	to	be	low,	and	serum	matrix	metalloproteinase	3	levels	cor-
relate	with	disease	activity.	Synovial	fluid	from	peripheral	joints	is	non-
specifically	inflammatory.	Restricted	chest	wall	motion	causes	decreased	
vital	capacity,	but	ventilatory	function	is	usually	well	maintained.

 ■ RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS (FIG. 362-1)
By	definition,	the	diagnosis	of	AS	is	associated	with	advanced	radio-
graphically	 demonstrable	 sacroiliitis,	 usually	 symmetric.	 The	 earliest	
changes	by	standard	radiography	are	blurring	of	the	cortical	margins	of	
the	subchondral	bone,	followed	by	erosions	and	sclerosis.	Progression	
of	the	erosions	leads	to	“pseudowidening”	of	the	joint	space;	as	fibrous	
and	then	bony	ankylosis	supervene,	the	joints	may	become	obliterated.
In	the	lumbar	spine,	progression	of	the	disease	can	lead	to	loss	of	
lordosis,	 and	 osteitis	 of	 the	 anterior	 corners	 of	 the	 vertebral	 bodies

2794 with	subsequent	erosion,	and	new	bone	formation	causing	“squaring”	
or	even	“barreling”	of	one	or	more	vertebral	bodies.	Progressive	ossifi-
cation	leads	to	eventual	formation	of	marginal	syndesmophytes,	visible	
on	plain	films	as	bony	bridges	connecting	successive	vertebral	bodies	
anteriorly	and	laterally.

spondylosis	 and	 from	 AS,	 respectively.	 Both	 primary	 and	 secondary	
hyperparathyroidism	 can	 cause	 subchondral	 bone	 resorption	 around	
the	 SI	 joints,	 with	 bilateral	 widened	 and	 ill-defined	 joints	 on	 radio-
graphs,	but	without	joint	space	narrowing.

An	algorithm	for	making	or	excluding	the	diagnosis	of	ax-SpA	in	

Only	a	minority	of	patients	meeting	criteria	for	nr-axSpA	develop	
radiographic	 sacroiliitis	 within	 a	 decade	 or	 more,	 and	 even	 fewer	
develop	spinal	changes.	MRI	is	thus	much	more	useful	for	the	timely	
diagnosis	 of	 ax-SpA,	 provided	 that	 it	 is	 done	 correctly.	 It  must  be 
emphasized  that  MRI  protocols  routinely  used  to  evaluate  low  back 
pain  have  low  sensitivity  for  detecting  inflammation  and  often  give 
false-negative  results  in  ax-SpA.	 Active	 sacroiliitis	 is	 best	 visualized	
by	 dynamic	 MRI	 on	 semicoronal	 slices	 with	 fat	 saturation,	 either	
T2-weighted	turbo	spin-echo	sequence	or	short	tau	inversion	recovery	
(STIR)	 with	 high	 resolution,	 or	 T1-weighted	 images	 with	 contrast	
enhancement.	These	techniques	identify	early	intraarticular	inflamma-
tion,	cartilage	changes,	and	underlying	bone	marrow	edema	in	sacroiliitis	
(Fig.	 362-1).	 These	 protocols	 are	 also	 sensitive	 for	 evaluation	 of	 acute	
and	chronic	spinal	changes.	Bone	marrow	edema	alone	is	not	specific	for	
spondyloarthritis.	 The	 presence	 of	 erosions	 enhances	 specificity	 and	 is	
best	detected	on	conventional	T1-weighted	images.	Optimal	MRI	results	
require	a	high	index	of	suspicion,	an	appropriate	protocol,	an	experienced	
radiologist,	and	close	communication	between	radiologist	and	clinician.

Reduced	bone	mineral	density	can	be	detected	by	dual-energy	x-ray	
absorptiometry	of	the	femoral	neck	and	the	lumbar	spine.	Employing	
a	lateral	projection	of	the	L3	vertebral	body	can	prevent	falsely	elevated	
readings	related	to	spinal	ossification.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
It	 is	 important	 to	 recognize	 ax-SpA	 before	 the	 development	 of	 irre-
versible	deformity.	This	goal	is	challenging	for	several	reasons:	(1)	only	
a	 minority	 of	 back	 pain	 patients	 have	 ax-SpA;	 (2)	 an	 early	 diagnosis	
often	 relies	 on	 clinical	 grounds	 and/or	 an	 appropriate	 MRI	 protocol	
requiring	considerable	expertise;	(3)	young	individuals	with	symptoms	
of	ax-SpA	often	do	not	seek	medical	care;	and	(4)	reliance	on	definite	
radiographic	 sacroiliitis	 causes	 early	 or	 mild	 cases	 to	 be	 missed.	 The	
classification	criteria	for	ax-SpA	proposed	by	ASAS	are	shown	in	Table	
362-1.	They	were	developed	for	research	purposes	only	and	should	not	
be	strictly	applied	as	diagnostic	criteria	but	can	be	considered	an	aid	to	
diagnosis.	They	are	applicable	to	individuals	with	≥3	months	of	back	
pain	and	age	of	onset	<45	years.	Active	inflammation	of	the	sacroiliac	
joints	as	determined	by	MRI	is	considered	equivalent	to	definite	radio-
graphic	sacroiliitis	(see	below).

AxSpA	must	be	differentiated	from	numerous	other	causes	of	low-
back	 pain,	 some	 substantially	 more	 common	 than	 axSpA.	 Increased	
specificity	 is	 obtained	 when	 the	 nature	 and	 pattern	 of	 the	 pain	 and	
the	 age	 of	 the	 patient	 are	 considered.	 The	 most	 typical	 symptom	 is	
inflammatory	 back	 pain	 (IBP),	 present	 in	 70–80%	 of	 patients	 with	
axSpA.	In	chronic	(≥3	months)	back	pain,	IBP	has	the	following	char-
acteristic	features:	(1)	age	of	onset	<40	years;	(2)	insidious	onset;	(3)	
improvement	 with	 exercise;	 (4)	 no	 improvement	 with	 rest;	 (5)	 pain	
at	 night	 with	 improvement	 upon	 getting	 up;	 (6)	 morning	 stiffness		
>30	min;	(7)	awakening	from	back	pain	during	only	the	second	half	
of	 the	 night;	 and	 (8)	 alternating	 buttock	 pain.	 The	 presence	 of	 two	
or	 more	 of	 these	 features	 should	 arouse	 suspicion	 for	 IBP,	 and	 four	
or	more	can	be	considered	presumptively	diagnostic.	The	most	com-
mon	causes	of	back	pain	other	than	SpA	are	primarily	mechanical	or	
degenerative	rather	than	primarily	inflammatory.	These	are	less	likely	
to	show	clustering	of	SpA	features,	but	IBP	can	be	present	in	up	to	30%	
of	patients	with	mechanical	back	pain.

Less-common	causes	of	back	pain	must	also	be	differentiated	from	
axSpA,	including	infectious	spondylitis,	spondylodiskitis,	or	sacroiliitis;	
and	primary	or	metastatic	tumor.	Ochronosis	can	produce	a	phenotype	
similar	to	AS.	Calcification	and	ossification	of	paraspinous	ligaments	
occur	in	diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis	(DISH),	which	occurs	in	
middle	age	and	above	and	is	usually	asymptomatic.	Ligamentous	cal-
cification	gives	the	appearance	of	“flowing	wax”	on	the	anterior	bodies	
of	the	vertebrae.	Intervertebral	disk	spaces	are	preserved,	and	sacroiliac	
and	 facet	 joints	 appear	 normal,	 helping	 to	 differentiate	 DISH	 from	

patients	with	chronic	back	pain	is	shown	in	Fig. 362-2.

TREATMENT
Axial Spondyloarthritis

All	 management	 of	 ax-SpA	 should	 include	 an	 exercise	 program	
to	 maintain	 posture	 and	 range	 of	 motion.	 Exercise	 videos	 are	
available	 from	 the	 Spondylitis	 Association	 of	 America	 (https://
spondylitis.org/resources-support/educational-materials-resources/
back-in-action-again/.)

Nonsteroidal	 anti-inflammatory	 drugs	 (NSAIDs)	 are	 the	 first	
line	of	pharmacologic	therapy.	They	reduce	pain	and	tenderness	and	
increase	mobility	in	many	patients.	Continuous	high-dose	NSAID	
therapy	may	slow	radiographic	progression,	particularly	in	patients	
who	 are	 at	 higher	 risk	 for	 progression.	 However,	 many	 patients	
have	persistent	symptoms	despite	NSAID	therapy	and	may	benefit	
from	biologic	therapy.	Patients	with	AS	treated	with	the	anti-TNF	
agents	 infliximab	 (chimeric	 human/mouse	 anti-TNF	 monoclonal	
antibody),	 etanercept	 (soluble	 p75	 TNF	 receptor–IgG	 fusion	 pro-
tein),	 adalimumab	 or	 golimumab	 (human	 anti-TNF	 monoclonal	
antibodies),	 or	 certolizumab	 pegol	 (humanized	 mouse	 anti-TNF	
monoclonal	antibody)	have	shown	rapid,	profound,	and	sustained	
reductions	in	all	clinical	and	laboratory	measures	of	disease	activ-
ity.	 In	 a	 good	 response,	 there	 is	 significant	 improvement	 in	 both	
objective	and	subjective	indicators	of	disease	activity	and	function,	
including	morning	stiffness,	pain,	spinal	mobility,	peripheral	joint	
swelling,	 CRP,	 ESR,	 and	 bone	 mineral	 density.	 MRI	 studies	 indi-
cate	substantial	resolution	of	bone	marrow	edema,	enthesitis,	and	
joint	effusions	in	the	sacroiliac,	facet,	and	peripheral	joints.	These	
results	have	been	obtained	in	large	randomized	controlled	trials	of	
all	five	agents	and	many	open-label	studies.	About	one-half	of	the	
patients	 achieve	 a	 ≥50%	 reduction	 in	 the	 BASDAI.	 The	 response	
tends	to	persist	over	time	and	remission	of	symptoms	is	feasible	in	
a	 proportion	 of	 patients.	 Predictors	 of	 the	 best	 responses	 include	
younger	 age,	 shorter	 disease	 duration,	 higher	 baseline	 inflamma-
tory	markers,	and	lower	baseline	functional	disability.	Nonetheless,	
some	patients	with	long-standing	disease	and	even	spinal	ankylosis	
obtain	significant	benefit.	There	is	greater	chance	of	slowing	syn-
desmophyte	formation	with	sustained	therapy,	especially	if	started	
early.	The	response	of	patients	with	nr-axSpA	to	anti-TNF	therapy	
is	generally	similar	to	that	of	patients	with	AS.

Typically,	 infliximab	 is	 given	 intravenously,	 5	 mg/kg	 body	
weight,	 and	 then	 repeated	 2	 weeks	 later,	 again	 6	 weeks	 later,	 and	
then	at	6-	to	8-week	intervals.	Etanercept	is	given	by	subcutaneous	
injection,	50	mg	once	weekly.	Adalimumab	is	given	by	subcutane-
ous	injection,	40	mg	biweekly.	Golimumab	is	given	by	subcutaneous	
injection,	 50	 mg	 every	 4	 weeks.	 Certolizumab	 pegol	 is	 given	 by	
subcutaneous	injection,	200	mg	biweekly	or	400	mg	every	4	weeks.	
Dosage	adjustments	can	be	considered	in	selected	cases.

These	potent	immunosuppressive	agents	are	relatively	safe,	but	
patients	are	at	increased	risk	for	serious	infections,	including	dis-
seminated	tuberculosis.	Hypersensitivity	infusion	or	injection	site	
reactions	are	not	uncommon.	Cases	of	anti-TNF-induced	psoriasis	
have	 been	 increasingly	 recognized.	 Rare	 cases	 of	 systemic	 lupus	
erythematosus	 (SLE)–related	 disease	 have	 been	 reported,	 as	 have	
hematologic	 disorders	 such	 as	 pancytopenia,	 demyelinating	 dis-
orders,	 exacerbation	 of	 congestive	 heart	 failure,	 and	 severe	 liver	
disease.	 The	 overall	 incidence	 of	 malignancy	 is	 not	 increased	 in	
AS	 patients	 treated	 with	 anti-TNF	 therapy,	 but	 isolated	 cases	 of	
hematologic	 malignancy	 have	 occurred	 shortly	 after	 initiation	 of	
treatment.

Because	 of	 the	 expense,	 potentially	 serious	 side	 effects,	 and	
unknown	 long-term	 effects	 of	 these	 agents,	 their	 use	 should	 be

FIGURE 362-2  Algorithm for the diagnosis or exclusion of axial spondyloarthritis. The algorithm is designed for use in patients with at least a 3-month history of unexplained 
chronic low-back pain. Definite radiographic sacroiliitis is based on the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (van der Linden S et al: Arthritis Rheum 27:361, 
1984). The algorithm is adapted from van den Berg R et al: Ann Rheum Dis 72:1646, 2013. The determination of whether or not a clinical picture is compelling is based on 
the relative weights of the spondyloarthritis features (Feldtkeller E et al: Rheumatology [Oxford] 52:1648, 2013) and on clinical judgment. The list of clinical features includes 
features of both axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis. *Confirming MRI is recommended. (From Taurog JD et al: N Engl J Med 374:2563, 2016.)

restricted	 to	 patients	 with	 a	 definite	 diagnosis	 and	 active	 disease	
that	is	inadequately	responsive	to	therapy	with	at	least	two	different	
NSAIDs.	Before	initiation	of	anti-TNF	therapy,	all	patients	should	
be	tested	for	latent	tuberculosis	(TB)	and	for	hepatitis	B,	and	treated	
appropriately	if	either	is	found.	Contraindications	to	TNF	inhibitors	
include	active	infection	or	high	risk	of	infection;	multiple	sclerosis;	
and	history	of	hematologic	malignancy,	SLE,	or	related	autoimmu-
nity.	Pregnancy	and	breast-feeding	are	no	longer	considered	con-
traindications	 if	 appropriate	 precautions	 are	 taken.	 Certolizumab	
pegol’s	label	includes	minimal	transplacental	or	breast	milk	transfer.	

However,	infants	exposed	to	anti-TNF	in	utero	should	not	be	given	
live	vaccines	before	age	6	months.	Switching	to	a	second	anti-TNF	
agent	may	be	effective,	especially	if	there	was	a	response	to	the	first

FIGURE 362-3  Proposed hierarchy of cytokine participation in disease pathogenesis in affected tissues in spondyloarthritis, based on the therapeutic response in clinical 
trials to biologic agents targeting the indicated cytokines. Peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and psoriasis respond to agents targeting IL-17A, IL-23 (p19 subunit), IL-12/23 (p40 
subunit), and TNF. Axial arthritis responds to anti-TNF and anti-IL17A, but failed to respond to anti-IL-23 and anti-IL12/23. Uveitis responds to anti-TNF, and anecdotally to 
anti-IL-12/23. The effect of anti-IL-17A in uveitis is not yet resolved. IBD responds to anti-TNF, anti-IL-23, and anti-IL-12/23, but failed to respond to anti-IL-17A and anti-IL-17 
receptor. (Adapted from S Siebert et al: Ann Rheum Dis 78:1015, 2019.)

dose	of	secukinumab	is	150	mg	subcutaneously	weekly	for	4	weeks,	
and	 then	 at	 4-week	 intervals.	 The	 recommended	 initiation	 of	
ixekizumab	is	with	two	80	mg	injections,	followed	by	80	mg	every	
4	 weeks.	 Precautions	 regarding	 infection	 are	 similar	 to	 those	 for	
anti-TNF	agents.	An	additional	concern	is	potential	exacerbation	of	
underlying	IBD,	whether	previously	recognized	or	not,	and	careful	
monitoring	is	advised.

Two	antibodies	targeting	IL-23,	ustakinumab	and	risankizumab,	
failed	to	show	efficacy	in	AS,	whereas	both	show	efficacy	in	psori-
atic	arthritis	(see	Fig. 362-3).

Sulfasalazine,	in	doses	of	2–3	g/d,	is	used	for	peripheral	arthritis.	
Methotrexate,	although	widely	used,	has	not	been	shown	to	be	of	
benefit	in	AS,	nor	has	any	therapeutic	role	for	oral	glucocorticoids	
been	documented.

The	oral	Janus	kinase	(JAK)	inhibitors,	tofacitinib,	upadacitinib,	
and	filgotinib,	have	all	shown	efficacy	in	AS	in	clinical	trials,	with	
reduction	 of	 inflammation	 evident	 on	 MRI,	 and	 further	 clinical	
trials	are	in	progress.	Precautions	regarding	infection	are	similar	to	
those	for	anti-TNF	agents,	with	additional	concern	for	herpes	zoster.
The	most	common	indication	for	surgery	in	patients	with	AS	is	
severe	hip	joint	arthritis,	the	pain	and	stiffness	of	which	are	usually	
dramatically	 relieved	 by	 total	 hip	 arthroplasty.	 Rare	 patients	 may	
benefit	from	surgical	correction	of	extreme	flexion	deformities	of	
the	spine	or	of	atlantoaxial	subluxation.

Attacks	 of	 uveitis	 are	 usually	 managed	 effectively	 with	 local	
glucocorticoids	and	mydriatic	agents,	although	systemic	glucocor-
ticoids,	 immunosuppressive	 drugs,	 or	 anti-TNF	 therapy	 may	 be	

required.	 TNF	 inhibitors	 may	 reduce	 the	 frequency	 of	 attacks	 of	
uveitis	in	patients	with	ax-SpA.	Cases	of	new	or	recurrent	uveitis	
with	 use	 of	 a	 TNF	 inhibitor	 have	 been	 observed,	 especially	 with	
etanercept.	 Adalimumab	 is	 FDA	 approved	 to	 treat	 intermediate,	
posterior,	 or	 panuveitis.	 These	 presentations	 are	 rare	 in	 AS	 but	
not	 unusual	 in	 psoriatic	 or	 IBD-associated	 arthritis	 (see	 below).	
Anti-IL-17A	 agents	 have	 not	 been	 directly	 studied	 as	 treatment	
for	 SpA-associated	 uveitis,	 but	 secukinumab-treated	 AS	 patients	
showed	no	increased	incidence	of	uveitis	in	clinical	trials.

Spinal	manipulation	is	strongly	discouraged	and	can	be	partic-
ularly	dangerous	in	patients	with	osteoporosis	or	structural	lesions	
on	x-ray.

Management	 of	 axial	 osteoporosis	 is	 similar	 to	 that	 used	 for	
primary	osteoporosis	because	data	specific	for	AS	are	not	available.

REACTIVE ARTHRITIS
ReA	 refers	 to	 acute	 nonpurulent	 arthritis	 complicating	 an	 infection	
elsewhere	in	the	body.	In	recent	years,	the	term	has	been	used	primarily	
to	refer	to	SpA	following	enteric	or	urogenital	infections.

Other forms of reactive and infection-related arthritis not associ-
ated with B27 and showing a spectrum of clinical features different 
from SpA, such as Lyme disease, rheumatic fever, and poststrepto-
coccal ReA, are discussed in Chaps. 186 and 359.

tis	has	been	recognized	for	centuries.	A	high	incidence	during	World

Wars	I	and	II	focused	attention	on	the	triad	of	arthritis,	urethritis,	and	
conjunctivitis,	 often	 with	 additional	 mucocutaneous	 lesions,	 which	
became	known	by	eponyms	that	are	now	of	historic	interest	only.

The	 identification	 of	 bacterial	 species	 triggering	 the	 clinical	 syn-
drome	 and	 the	 finding	 of	 an	 association	 with	 HLA-B27	 led	 to	 the	
unifying	 concept	 of	 ReA	 as	 a	 clinical	 syndrome	 triggered	 by	 specific	
etiologic	agents	in	a	genetically	susceptible	host.	A	characteristic	spec-
trum	 of	 clinical	 manifestations	 can	 be	 triggered	 by	 enteric	 infection	
with	certain	Shigella,	Salmonella,	Yersinia,	and	Campylobacter	species;	
by	 genital	 infection	 with	 Chlamydia  trachomatis;	 and	 by	 many	 other	
agents	as	well,	apparently	in	some	cases	via	nasopharyngeal	infection	
with	 Chlamydia  pneumoniae	 or	 other	 agents.	 The	 “classic	 triad”	 rep-
resents	a	small	part	of	the	clinical	spectrum	and	is	present	only	in	a	
small	 minority	 of	 patients.	 For	 the	 purposes	 of	 this	 chapter,	 the	 use	
of	the	term	ReA	will	be	restricted	to	those	cases	of	SpA	with	at	least	
presumptive	evidence	for	a	related	antecedent	infection.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
In	early	reports,	60–85%	of	patients	who	developed	ReA	triggered	by	
Shigella,	 Yersinia,	 or	 Chlamydia	 were	 HLA-B27-positive.	 However,	 a	
lower	prevalence	of	B27	is	found	in	ReA	triggered	by	Salmonella,	and	
little	 or	 no	 B27	 association	 is	 seen	 in	 Campylobacter-induced	 ReA.	
Recent	community-based	or	common-source	epidemic	studies	showed	
an	 overall	 prevalence	 of	 B27	 in	 ReA	 <50%.	 The	 most	 common	 age	
range	is	18–40	years,	but	ReA	can	occur	in	children	and	older	adults.

The	reported	attack	rate	of	postenteric	ReA	ranges	from	1%	to	about	
30%,	 depending	 on	 the	 study	 and	 causative	 organism,	 whereas	 the	
attack	rate	of	postchlamydial	ReA	is	~4–8%.	The	gender	ratio	following	
enteric	infection	is	nearly	1:1,	whereas	venereally	acquired	ReA	occurs	
mainly	in	men.	The	overall	prevalence	and	incidence	of	ReA	are	diffi-
cult	to	assess	because	of	lack	of	validated	diagnostic	criteria,	variable	
prevalence	and	arthritogenic	potential	of	the	triggering	microbes,	and	
varying	genetic	susceptibility	in	different	populations.	In	Scandinavia,	
an	 annual	 incidence	 of	 10–28:100,000	 has	 been	 reported.	 SpA	 was	
formerly	almost	unknown	in	sub-Saharan	Africa.	However,	ReA	and	
other	peripheral	SpAs	became	common	in	black	Africans	in	the	wake	
of	 the	 AIDS	 epidemic,	 without	 association	 to	 B27,	 which	 is	 rare	 in	
these	populations.	In	Africans,	ReA	is	often	the	first	manifestation	of	
HIV	infection	and	often	remits	with	disease	progression.	In	contrast,	
Western	white	patients	with	HIV	and	SpA	are	usually	B27-positive,	and	
the	arthritis	flares	as	AIDS	advances.
 ■ PATHOLOGY
Synovial	 histology	 is	 similar	 to	 that	 of	 other	 SpAs.	 Enthesitis	 shows	
increased	 vascularity	 and	 macrophage	 infiltration	 of	 fibrocartilage.	
Microscopic	histopathologic	evidence	of	inflammation	mimicking	IBD	
has	 routinely	 been	 demonstrated	 in	 the	 colon	 and	 ileum	 of	 patients	
with	 postenteric	 ReA	 and	 less	 commonly	 in	 postvenereal	 ReA.	 The	
skin	 lesions	 of	 keratoderma	 blennorrhagica,	 associated	 mainly	 with	
venereally	 acquired	 ReA,	 are	 histologically	 indistinguishable	 from	
pustular	psoriasis.
 ■ ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Definite	bacterial	triggers	of	ReA	include	several	Salmonella	spp.,	Shigella	
spp.,	Yersinia enterocolitica,	Yersinia pseudotuberculosis,	Campylobacter 
jejuni,	and	Chlamydia trachomatis.	These	are	all	gram-negative	bacteria	
containing	 lipopolysaccharide	 (LPS).	 All	 Shigella	 species	 have	 been	
implicated	in	cases	of	ReA,	with	S. flexneri	and	S. sonnei	being	the	most	
common.	Yersinia	species	in	Europe	and	Scandinavia	may	have	greater	
arthritogenic	potential	than	elsewhere,	and	C. trachomatis	appears	to	
be	a	common	trigger	worldwide.	The	ocular	serovars	of	C. trachomatis	
appear	to	be	particularly,	perhaps	uniquely,	arthritogenic.

There	is	also	evidence	implicating	Clostridium difficile,	Campylobacter 
coli,	 certain	 toxigenic	 Escherichia  coli,	 Ureaplasma  urealyticum,	 and	
Mycoplasma  genitalium	 as	 potential	 triggers	 of	 ReA.	 Chlamydia 
pneumoniae	 can	 trigger	 ReA,	 but	 far	 less	 commonly	 so	 than		
C.  trachomatis.	 There	 have	 been	 numerous	 isolated	 reports	 of	 acute	
arthritis	following	many	other	bacterial,	viral,	or	parasitic	infections,	
and	arthritis	following	intravesicular	bacillus	Calmette-Guérin	(BCG)	
treatment	for	bladder	cancer	is	well	documented.

It	is	not	known	whether	there	is	a	common	pathogenic	mechanism	
for	triggering	ReA	that	is	shared	by	all	of	these	microorganisms,	nor	
has	the	mechanism	been	elucidated	for	any	particular	trigger.	Many	of	
the	established	triggers	share	a	capacity	to	attack	mucosal	surfaces,	to	
invade	host	cells,	and	to	survive	intracellularly.	Antigens	from	Chlamydia,	
Yersinia,	Salmonella,	and	Shigella	have	been	found	in	synovium	and/
or	synovial	fluid	leukocytes	of	patients	with	ReA	for	long	periods	fol-
lowing	the	acute	attack.	In	ReA	triggered	by	Y. enterocolitica,	bacterial	
LPS	 and	 heat-shock	 protein	 antigens	 have	 been	 found	 in	 peripheral	
blood	 cells	 years	 after	 the	 triggering	 infection.	 Yersinia	 DNA	 and	 C. 
trachomatis	DNA	and	RNA	have	been	detected	in	synovial	tissue	from	
ReA	patients,	suggesting	the	presence	of	viable	organisms	despite	uni-
form	failure	to	culture	organisms	from	these	specimens.	The	specificity	
of	 these	 findings	 is	 unclear,	 however,	 since	 chromosomal	 bacterial	
DNA	 and	 16S	 rRNA	 from	 a	 wide	 variety	 of	 bacteria	 have	 also	 been	
found	in	synovium	in	other	rheumatic	diseases,	albeit	less	frequently.

Recent	work	has	documented	high	levels	of	IL-17	in	ReA	synovial	
fluid,	 but	 the	 source	 has	 not	 been	 identified.	 HLA-B27	 seems	 to	 be	
associated	with	more	severe	and	chronic	ReA,	but	its	pathogenic	role	
remains	to	be	determined.	HLA-B27	significantly	prolongs	the	intra-
cellular	survival	of	Y. enterocolitica	and	Salmonella enteritidis	in	human	
and	mouse	cell	lines.	This	may	permit	trafficking	of	infected	leukocytes	
from	 the	 site	 of	 primary	 infection	 to	 joints,	 where	 an	 innate	 and/or	
adaptive	 immune	 response	 to	 persistent	 bacterial	 antigens	 may	 then	
promote	arthritis.

A	 recent	 study	 using	 16S	 ribosomal	 RNA	 gene	 sequencing	 of	
intestinal	 microbiota	 showed	 a	 higher	 abundance	 of	 Erwinia	 and	
Pseudomonas	 species	 and	 an	 increased	 prevalence	 of	 typical	 entero-
pathogens	in	ReA	patients,	compared	with	controls.	Correlations	were	
found	between	specific	bacteria	and	disease	manifestations,	and	there	
was	an	HLA	correlation	with	microbiome	diversity.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
The	 clinical	 manifestations	 of	 ReA	 range	 from	 an	 isolated,	 transient	
monoarthritis	 or	 enthesitis	 to	 severe	 multisystem	 disease.	 A	 careful	
history	will	often	elicit	evidence	of	an	antecedent	infection	1–4	weeks	
before	onset	of	symptoms	of	the	reactive	disease,	particularly	in	pos-
tenteric	ReA.	However,	in	a	sizable	minority,	no	clinical	or	laboratory	
evidence	of	an	antecedent	infection	can	be	found,	particularly	in	the	
case	of	postchlamydial	ReA.	In	cases	of	presumed	venereally	acquired	
reactive	disease,	there	is	often	a	history	of	a	recent	new	sexual	partner.
Constitutional	 symptoms	 are	 common,	 including	 fatigue,	 malaise,	
fever,	and	weight	loss.	The	musculoskeletal	symptoms	are	usually	acute	
in	 onset.	 Arthritis	 is	 usually	 asymmetric	 and	 additive,	 with	 involve-
ment	of	new	joints	occurring	over	a	few	days	to	1–2	weeks.	The	joints	
of	 the	 lower	 extremities,	 especially	 the	 knee,	 ankle,	 subtalar,	 meta-
tarsophalangeal,	 and	 toe	 interphalangeal	 joints,	 are	 most	 commonly	
involved,	 but	 the	 wrist	 and	 fingers	 may	 be	 involved.	 The	 arthritis	 is	
usually	 quite	 painful,	 and	 tense	 joint	 effusions	 are	 not	 uncommon,	
especially	in	the	knee.	Dactylitis,	or	“sausage	digit,”	a	diffuse	swelling	
of	a	solitary	finger	or	toe,	is	a	distinctive	feature	of	ReA	and	PsA,	but	
can	be	seen	in	polyarticular	gout	and	sarcoidosis.	Tendinitis	and	fas-
ciitis	are	particularly	characteristic	lesions,	producing	pain	at	multiple	
entheses,	especially	the	Achilles	insertion,	the	plantar	fascia,	and	sites	
along	the	axial	skeleton.	Back	and	buttock	pain	are	quite	common	and	
may	be	caused	by	insertional	inflammation,	muscle	spasm,	acute	sacro-
iliitis,	or,	presumably,	arthritis	in	intervertebral	joints.

Urogenital	lesions	may	occur	throughout	the	course	of	the	disease.	
In	men,	urethritis	may	be	marked	or	relatively	asymptomatic	and	may	
be	 either	 an	 accompaniment	 of	 the	 triggering	 infection	 or	 a	 result	
of	 the	 reactive	 phase	 of	 the	 disease;	 interestingly,	 it	 occurs	 in	 both	
postvenereal	and	postenteric	ReA.	Prostatitis	is	common.	In	women,	
cervicitis	or	salpingitis	may	be	caused	either	by	the	infectious	trigger	
or	by	the	sterile	reactive	process.

Ocular	 disease	 is	 common,	 ranging	 from	 transient,	 asymptomatic	
conjunctivitis	to	an	aggressive	anterior	uveitis	that	occasionally	proves	
refractory	to	treatment	and	may	result	in	blindness.

Mucocutaneous	lesions	are	frequent.	Oral	ulcers	tend	to	be	superfi-
cial,	transient,	and	often	asymptomatic.	The	characteristic	skin	lesion,

2798 keratoderma  blennorrhagica,	 consists	 of	 vesicles	 and/or	 pustules	 that	
become	 hyperkeratotic,	 ultimately	 forming	 a	 crust	 before	 disappear-
ing.	 They	 are	 most	 common	 on	 the	 palms	 and	 soles	 but	 may	 occur	
elsewhere	 as	 well.	 In	 patients	 with	 HIV	 infection,	 these	 lesions	 are	
often	severe	and	extensive,	sometimes	dominating	the	clinical	picture	
(Chap.  202).	 Lesions	 on	 the	 glans	 penis,	 termed	 circinate  balanitis,	
consist	 of	 vesicles	 that	 quickly	 rupture	 to	 form	 painless	 superficial	
erosions,	which	in	circumcised	individuals	can	form	crusts	similar	to	
those	of	keratoderma	blennorrhagica.	Nail	changes	are	common	and	
consist	of	onycholysis,	distal	yellowish	discoloration,	and/or	heaped-up	
hyperkeratosis.

Less	frequent	or	rare	manifestations	of	ReA	include	cardiac	conduc-
tion	defects,	aortic	insufficiency,	central	or	peripheral	nervous	system	
lesions,	and	pleuropulmonary	infiltrates.

In	resolving	cases,	arthritis	typically	lasts	for	3–5	months.	Chronic	
joint	symptoms	persist	in	about	15%	of	patients,	and	in	up	to	60%	of	
patients	in	hospital-based	series.	The	chronic	symptoms	tend	to	be	less	
severe	than	in	the	acute	stage,	but	work	disability	or	forced	change	in	
occupation	is	common.	Chronic	heel	pain	is	often	particularly	distress-
ing.	Low-back	pain,	sacroiliitis,	or	even	overt	AS	are	common	sequelae.	
Recurrences	of	the	acute	syndrome	may	occur.	In	most	studies,	HLA-
B27–positive	 patients	 showed	 a	 worse	 outcome	 than	 B27-negative	
patients.	 Patients	 with	 Yersinia-	 or	 Salmonella-induced	 arthritis	 have	
less	chronic	disease	than	those	whose	initial	episode	follows	epidemic	
shigellosis.

 ■ LABORATORY AND RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS
The	 ESR	 and	 acute-phase	 reactants	 are	 usually	 elevated	 during	 the	
acute	 phase	 of	 the	 disease,	 often	 markedly.	 Mild	 anemia	 may	 be	
present.	 Synovial	 fluid	 is	 nonspecifically	 inflammatory.	 In	 most	 eth-
nic	 groups,	 30–50%	 of	 the	 patients	 are	 B27-positive.	 The	 triggering	
infection	 usually	 does	 not	 persist	 at	 the	 site	 of	 primary	 mucosal	
infection	 through	 the	 time	 of	 onset	 of	 the	 reactive	 disease,	 but	 it	
may	 be	 possible	 to	 culture	 the	 organism,	 for	 example,	 in	 the	 case	 of		
Yersinia-	 or	 Chlamydia-induced	 disease.	 Serologic	 evidence	 of	 expo-
sure	to	a	causative	organism	is	nonspecific	and	of	questionable	utility.	
Polymerase	chain	reaction	(PCR)	for	chlamydial	DNA	in	first-voided	
urine	specimens	may	have	high	sensitivity	in	the	acute	stage	but	is	less	
useful	with	chronic	disease.

In	 early	 or	 mild	 disease,	 radiographic	 changes	 may	 be	 absent	 or	
confined	 to	 juxtaarticular	 osteoporosis.	 With	 long-standing	 disease,	
radiographic	 features	 share	 those	 of	 PsA;	 marginal	 erosions	 and	 loss	
of	 joint	 space	 can	 be	 seen	 in	 affected	 joints.	 Periostitis	 with	 reactive	
new	bone	formation	is	characteristic,	as	in	all	the	SpAs.	Spurs	at	the	
insertion	of	the	plantar	fascia	are	common.	Sacroiliitis	and	spondylitis	
may	be	seen	as	late	sequelae.	Sacroiliitis	is	more	commonly	asymmet-
ric	than	in	AS,	and	spondylitis	can	begin	anywhere	along	the	lumbar	
spine.	 The	 syndesmophytes	 are	 described	 as	 nonmarginal;	 they	 are	
coarse,	asymmetric,	and	“comma”-shaped,	arising	from	the	middle	of	a	
vertebral	body,	a	pattern	less	commonly	seen	in	primary	AS.	Progres-
sion	to	spinal	fusion	is	uncommon.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
ReA	 is	 a	 clinical	 diagnosis	 with	 no	 definitively	 diagnostic	 laboratory	
test	or	radiologic	finding.	The	diagnosis	should	be	entertained	in	any	
patient	with	an	acute	inflammatory,	asymmetric,	additive	arthritis	or	
tendinitis.	 The	 evaluation	 should	 include	 thorough	 but	 tactful	 ques-
tioning	regarding	possible	triggering	events.	On	physical	examination,	
attention	 must	 be	 paid	 to	 the	 distribution	 of	 the	 joint	 and	 tendon	
involvement	and	to	possible	sites	of	extraarticular	involvement,	includ-
ing	 the	 eyes,	 mucous	 membranes,	 skin,	 nails,	 and	 genitalia.	 Synovial	
fluid	analysis	is	usually	necessary	to	exclude	septic	or	crystal-induced	
arthritis.	Culture,	serology,	or	molecular	methods	may	help	identify	a	
triggering	infection,	but	they	cannot	be	relied	upon.

Although	typing	for	B27	has	low	negative	predictive	value	in	ReA,	it	
may	have	prognostic	significance	in	terms	of	severity,	chronicity,	and	
the	 propensity	 for	 spondylitis	 and	 uveitis.	 Furthermore,	 if	 positive,	
it	can	be	helpful	diagnostically	in	atypical	cases.	HIV	testing	is	often	
indicated	and	may	be	necessary	in	selecting	therapy.

Both	 ReA	 and	 disseminated	 gonococcal	 disease	 (Chap.  156)	 can	
be	 venereally	 acquired	 and	 associated	 with	 urethritis.	 Unlike	 ReA,	
gonococcal	arthritis	and	tenosynovitis	tend	to	involve	both	upper	and	
lower	 extremities	 equally,	 spare	 the	 axial	 skeleton,	 and	 be	 associated	
with	characteristic	vesicular	skin	lesions.	A	positive	gonococcal	culture	
from	the	urethra	or	cervix	does	not	exclude	ReA;	however,	culturing	
gonococci	from	blood,	skin	lesion,	or	synovium	establishes	the	diag-
nosis	 of	 disseminated	 gonococcal	 disease.	 PCR	 assay	 for	 Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae	 and	 C.  trachomatis	 may	 be	 helpful.	 Occasionally,	 only	 a	
therapeutic	trial	of	antibiotics	can	distinguish	ReA	from	disseminated	
gonococcal	disease.

ReA	shares	many	features	with	PsA.	However,	PsA	is	usually	gradual	
in	onset;	the	arthritis	tends	to	affect	primarily	the	upper	extremities;	
and	there	are	usually	no	associated	mouth	ulcers,	urethritis,	or	bowel	
symptoms.

TREATMENT
Reactive Arthritis

Most	 patients	 with	 ReA	 benefit	 to	 some	 degree	 from	 high-dose	
NSAIDs,	 although	 acute	 symptoms	 are	 rarely	 completely	 amelio-
rated,	and	some	patients	fail	to	respond	at	all.

Prompt,	 appropriate	 antibiotic	 treatment	 of	 acute	 chlamydial	
urethritis	 or	 enteric	 infection	 may	 prevent	 the	 emergence	 of	 ReA	
but	 is	 not	 universally	 successful.	 Data	 regarding	 the	 potential	
benefit	 of	 antibiotic	 therapy	 initiated	 after	 onset	 of	 arthritis	 are	
conflicting;	 however,	 a	 systematic	 review	 and	 meta-analysis	 of	 10	
controlled	trials	suggested	no	benefit.	One	of	these	trials	reported	
that	 a	 majority	 of	 patients	 with	 chronic	 ReA	 associated	 with	
C.  trachomatis	 or	 C.  pneumoniae	 benefited	 significantly	 from	 a	
6-month	 course	 of	 rifampin	 plus	 either	 azithromycin	 or	 doxycy-
cline.	This	2010	study	still	awaits	confirmation.

Multicenter	 trials	 have	 suggested	 that	 sulfasalazine,	 up	 to	 	
3	g/d	in	divided	doses,	may	be	beneficial	to	patients	with	persistent	
ReA.1	Patients	with	persistent	disease	may	respond	to	azathioprine,		
1–2	mg/kg	per	day,	or	to	methotrexate,	up	to	20	mg	per	week;	how-
ever,	these	regimens	have	never	formally	been	studied.	Anecdotal	
evidence	from	30	patients	supports	the	use	of	anti-TNF	in	severe	
chronic	cases,	and	there	are	isolated	reports	of	responses	to	anti-IL-
17A	or	anti-IL-6	receptor	therapy.1

Tendinitis	 and	 other	 enthesitic	 lesions	 may	 benefit	 from	 intra-
lesional	 glucocorticoids.	 Uveitis	 may	 require	 aggressive	 treatment	
to	 prevent	 serious	 sequelae.	 Skin	 lesions	 ordinarily	 require	 only	
symptomatic	topical	treatment.	In	patients	with	HIV	infection	and	
ReA,	 many	 of	 whom	 have	 severe	 skin	 lesions,	 the	 skin	 lesions	 in	
particular	respond	to	antiretroviral	therapy.	Cardiac	complications	
are	managed	conventionally;	management	of	neurologic	complica-
tions	is	symptomatic.

Comprehensive	 management	 includes	 counseling	 patients	 to	
avoid	 sexually	 transmitted	 disease	 and	 exposure	 to	 enteropatho-
gens,	 as	 well	 as	 appropriate	 use	 of	 physical	 therapy,	 vocational	
counseling,	and	continued	surveillance	for	long-term	complications	
such	as	AS.	Patients	with	a	history	of	ReA	are	at	increased	risk	for	
recurrent	attacks	following	repeat	exposure.

1Azathioprine,	methotrexate,	sulfasalazine,	pamidronate,	anti-TNFα	agents,	anti-IL-
17A	agents,	and	anti-IL-6	receptor	agents	have	not	been	approved	for	this	purpose	
by	the	FDA	at	the	time	of	publication.

PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS
Psoriatic  arthritis	 refers	 to	 an	 inflammatory	 musculoskeletal	 disease	
that	has	both	autoimmune	and	autoinflammatory	features	characteris-
tically	occurring	in	individuals	with	psoriasis.
 ■ HISTORIC BACKGROUND
The	association	between	arthritis	and	psoriasis	was	noted	in	the	nine-
teenth	century.	In	the	1960s,	it	became	clear	that	unlike	RA,	arthritis	
associated	with	psoriasis	was	usually	seronegative,	often	involved	the

distal	 interphalangeal	 (DIP)	 joints	 of	 the	 fingers	 and	 the	 spine	 and	
sacroiliac	 joints,	 had	 distinctive	 radiographic	 features,	 and	 showed	
considerable	 familial	 aggregation.	 In	 the	 1970s,	 PsA	 was	 included	 in	
the	broader	category	of	spondyloarthritis	because	of	features	similar	to	
those	of	AS	and	ReA.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
The	prevalence	of	PsA	appears	to	be	increasing	in	parallel	with	disease	
awareness.	Recent	data	suggest	that	up	to	30%	of	patients	with	psoriasis	
develop	PsA.	Longer	duration	and	greater	severity	of	psoriasis	increase	
the	likelihood	of	developing	PsA.	In	white	populations,	psoriasis	is	esti-
mated	to	have	a	prevalence	of	1–3%.	In	other	races,	psoriasis	and	PsA	
are	less	common	in	the	absence	of	HIV	infection,	and	the	prevalence	
of	PsA	in	individuals	with	psoriasis	may	be	less	common.	First-degree	
relatives	of	PsA	patients	have	an	elevated	risk	for	psoriasis,	for	PsA,	and	
for	other	forms	of	SpA.	Of	patients	with	psoriasis,	up	to	30%	have	an	
affected	first-degree	relative.	In	monozygotic	twins,	the	reported	con-
cordance	for	psoriasis	varies	from	35–72%,	and	for	PsA	from	10–30%.	
A	 variety	 of	 HLA	 associations	 have	 been	 found.	 HLA-C6	 is	 directly	
associated	 with	 psoriasis,	 particularly	 familial	 juvenile-onset	 (type	 I)	
psoriasis.	HLA-B27	is	associated	with	psoriatic	spondylitis	(see	below).	
HLA-DR7,	-DQ3,	and	-B57	are	associated	with	PsA	because	of	linkage	
disequilibrium	with	C6.	A	recent	study	found	additive	associations	of	
PsA	with	haplotypes	containing	HLA-B8,	-C6,	-B27,	-B38,	and	-B39.	A	
correlation	was	also	found	between	different	haplotype	combinations	
and	 entheseal,	 synovial,	 or	 axial	 predominant	 phenotypes.	 Genome-
wide	analyses	have	identified	associations	of	PsA	with	polymorphisms	
in	the	IL-23	receptor	(IL23R),	molecules	involved	in	nuclear	factor	κB	
gene	expression	(TNIP1, TRAF3IP2)	and	signaling	(TNFAIP3, TYK2),	
and	cytokines	TNF,	IL12A,	and	IL12B.	A	specific	IL23R	SNP	is	associ-
ated	with	PsA	distinct	from	psoriasis	without	arthritis.	Overall	genetic	
sharing	of	AS	with	psoriasis	is	0.28,	lower	than	with	IBD	(see	below).	
Polymorphisms	in	IL-23A	are	associated	with	psoriasis	and	with	PsA,	
but	not	with	AS.
 ■ PATHOLOGY
The	 inflamed	 synovium	 in	 PsA	 resembles	 that	 of	 RA,	 although	 with	
somewhat	less	hyperplasia	and	cellularity	than	in	RA.	As	noted	with	
AS	above,	the	synovial	vascular	pattern	in	PsA	is	generally	greater	and	
more	 tortuous	 than	 in	 RA,	 independent	 of	 disease	 duration.	 Some	
studies	 have	 indicated	 a	 higher	 tendency	 to	 synovial	 fibrosis	 in	 PsA.	
Unlike	RA,	PsA	shows	prominent	enthesitis,	with	histology	similar	to	
other	forms	of	SpA.
 ■ PATHOGENESIS
PsA	presumably	shares	immunopathogenic	mechanisms	with	psoria-
sis.	PsA	synovium	is	characterized	by	lining	layer	hyperplasia;	diffuse	
infiltration	with	T	cells,	B	cells,	macrophages,	and	NK	receptor–expressing	
cells,	with	upregulation	of	leukocyte	homing	receptors;	and	neutrophil	
proliferation	with	angiogenesis.	Clonally	expanded	T-cell	subpopula-
tions	are	frequent	and	have	been	demonstrated	both	in	the	synovium	
and	 the	 skin.	 Plasmacytoid	 dendritic	 cells	 are	 thought	 to	 play	 a	 key	
role	in	psoriasis,	and	there	is	some	evidence	for	their	participation	in	
PsA.	Interferon	γ,	TNF,	and	IL-1β,	2,	6,	8,	10,	12,	13,	15,	and	17A,	and	
myeloid-related	 protein	 (S100A8/A9)	 are	 found	 in	 PsA	 synovium	 or	
synovial	fluid.	IL-23/17	pathway	cytokines	are	critical	drivers	of	PsA	
pathogenesis.	 Both	 TH17	 cells	 and	 type	 3	 innate	 lymphocytes	 (ILC3)	
have	been	identified	in	dermal	extracts	of	psoriatic	lesions	and	in	syno-
vial	fluid	of	PsA	patients.	Consistent	with	the	extensive	bone	remod-
eling	 in	 PsA,	 patients	 with	 PsA	 have	 been	 found	 to	 have	 a	 marked	
increase	in	osteoclastic	precursors	in	peripheral	blood	and	upregula-
tion	of	receptor	activator	of	nuclear	factor	κB	ligand	(RANKL)	in	the	
synovial	lining	layer.	Increased	serum	levels	of	TNF,	RANKL,	leptin,	
and	omentin	positively	correlate	with	these	osteoclastic	precursors.
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
In	70%	of	cases,	psoriasis	precedes	joint	disease.	In	15%	of	cases,	the	
two	manifestations	appear	within	1	year	of	each	other.	In	about	15%	
of	cases,	the	arthritis	precedes	the	onset	of	psoriasis	and	can	present	
a	 diagnostic	 challenge.	 The	 frequency	 in	 men	 and	 women	 is	 almost	

equal,	although	the	frequency	of	disease	patterns	differs	somewhat	in	
the	two	sexes.	The	disease	can	begin	in	childhood	or	late	in	life	but	typ-
ically	begins	in	the	fourth	or	fifth	decade,	at	an	average	age	of	37	years.
Many	 classification	 schemes	 have	 been	 proposed	 for	 the	 broad	
spectrum	of	arthropathy	in	PsA.	Wright	and	Moll	described	five	pat-
terns:	(1)	arthritis	of	the	DIP	joints;	(2)	asymmetric	oligoarthritis;	(3)	
symmetric	polyarthritis	similar	to	RA;	(4)	axial	involvement	(spine	and	
sacroiliac	joints);	and	(5)	arthritis	mutilans,	a	highly	destructive	form	
of	the	disease.	These	patterns	frequently	coexist,	and	the	pattern	that	
persists	chronically	often	differs	from	that	of	the	initial	presentation.	
A	simpler	scheme	in	recent	use	contains	three	patterns:	oligoarthritis,	
polyarthritis,	and	axial	arthritis.

Nail	changes	in	the	fingers	or	toes	occur	in	most	patients	with	PsA,	
compared	with	only	a	minority	of	psoriatic	patients	without	arthritis,	
and	pustular	psoriasis	is	said	to	be	associated	with	more	severe	arthri-
tis.	Dactylitis	and	enthesitis	are	common	in	PsA	and	help	to	distinguish	
it	from	other	joint	disorders.	Dactylitis	occurs	in	>30%;	enthesitis	and	
tenosynovitis	are	probably	present	in	most	patients,	although	often	not	
appreciated	 on	 physical	 examination.	 Shortening	 of	 digits	 because	 of	
underlying	osteolysis	is	particularly	characteristic	of	PsA,	and	there	is	a	
much	greater	tendency	than	in	RA	for	both	fibrous	and	bony	ankylosis	
of	small	joints.	Rapid	ankylosis	of	one	or	more	proximal	interphalan-
geal	(PIP)	joints	early	in	the	course	of	disease	is	not	uncommon.	Joint	
involvement	tends	to	follow	a	“ray”	distribution,	with	all	of	the	joints	
of	one	finger	involved,	while	sparing	adjacent	fingers	entirely.	Back	and	
neck	pain	and	stiffness	are	also	common	in	PsA.

Arthropathy	 confined	 to	 the	 DIP	 joints	 occurs	 in	 ~5%	 of	 cases.	
Accompanying	 nail	 changes	 in	 the	 affected	 digits	 are	 almost	 always	
present.	 These	 joints	 are	 also	 often	 affected	 in	 the	 other	 patterns	 of	
PsA.	 Approximately	 30%	 of	 patients	 have	 asymmetric	 oligoarthritis.	
This	pattern	commonly	involves	a	knee	or	another	large	joint	with	a	
few	small	joints	in	the	fingers	or	toes,	often	with	dactylitis.	Symmetric	
polyarthritis	 occurs	 in	 about	 40%	 of	 PsA	 patients	 at	 presentation.	 It	
may	be	indistinguishable	from	RA	in	terms	of	the	joints	involved,	but	
other	 features	 characteristic	 of	 PsA	 are	 usually	 also	 present.	 Almost	
any	 peripheral	 joint	 can	 be	 involved.	 Axial	 arthritis	 without	 periph-
eral	involvement	is	found	in	~5%	of	PsA	patients.	It	may	be	clinically	
indistinguishable	from	idiopathic	AS,	although	more	neck	involvement	
and	less	thoracolumbar	spinal	involvement	are	characteristic,	and	nail	
changes	 are	 not	 found	 in	 idiopathic	 AS.	 A	 small	 percentage	 of	 PsA	
patients	 have	 arthritis	 mutilans,	 in	 which	 there	 can	 be	 widespread	
shortening	of	digits	(“telescoping”),	sometimes	coexisting	with	ankylo-
sis	and	contractures	in	other	digits.

Six	 patterns	 of	 nail	 involvement	 are	 identified:	 pitting,	 horizontal	
ridging,	onycholysis,	yellowish	discoloration	of	the	nail	margins,	dys-
trophic	 hyperkeratosis,	 and	 combinations	 of	 these	 findings.	 Extraar-
ticular	and	extradermal	manifestations	are	common.	Eye	involvement,	
either	conjunctivitis	or	uveitis,	is	reported	in	7–33%	of	PsA	patients.	
Unlike	 uveitis	 associated	 with	 AS,	 the	 uveitis	 in	 PsA	 is	 more	 often	
insidious	 in	 onset,	 bilateral,	 chronic,	 and/or	 nonanterior.	 The	 prev-
alences	 of	 aortic	 valve	 insufficiency	 and	 heart	 block	 are	 apparently	
similar	to	those	in	AS.

Widely	varying	estimates	of	clinical	outcome	have	been	reported	in	
PsA.	 At	 its	 worst,	 severe	 PsA	 with	 arthritis	 mutilans	 is	 potentially	 at	
least	 as	 crippling	 and	 ultimately	 fatal	 as	 severe	 untreated	 RA.	 Unlike	
RA,	 however,	 many	 patients	 with	 PsA	 experience	 temporary	 remis-
sions.	 Overall,	 erosive	 disease	 develops	 in	 the	 majority	 of	 patients,	
progressive	 disease	 with	 deformity	 and	 disability	 is	 common,	 and	 in	
some	 large	 series,	 mortality	 was	 found	 to	 be	 significantly	 increased	
compared	with	the	general	population.

The	 psoriasis	 and	 associated	 arthropathy	 seen	 with	 HIV	 infection	
both	tend	to	be	severe	and	can	occur	in	populations	with	low	preva-
lence	of	psoriasis.	Severe	enthesitis,	dactylitis,	and	rapidly	progressive	
joint	 destruction	 are	 seen,	 but	 axial	 involvement	 is	 very	 rare.	 This	
condition	is	prevented	by	or	responds	well	to	antiretroviral	therapy.

 ■ LABORATORY AND RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS
There	 are	 no	 laboratory	 tests	 diagnostic	 of	 PsA.	 ESR	 and	 CRP	 are	
elevated	in	only	30%	of	patients.	A	small	percentage	of	patients	may

2800 have	low	titers	of	rheumatoid	factor	or	ANAs.	About	10%	of	patients	
have	anti-CCP	antibodies.	Uric	acid	may	be	elevated	in	the	presence	of	
extensive	psoriasis.	HLA-B27	is	found	in	50–70%	of	patients	with	axial	
disease	but	in	≤20%	of	patients	with	only	peripheral	joint	involvement.
Peripheral	 and	 axial	 arthritis	 in	 PsA	 show	 several	 radiographic	
features	 that	 distinguish	 them	 from	 RA	 and	 AS,	 respectively.	 Char-
acteristics	 of	 peripheral	 PsA	 include	 DIP	 involvement,	 including	 the	
classic	 “pencil-in-cup”	 deformity;	 marginal	 erosions	 with	 adjacent	
bony	 proliferation	 (“whiskering”);	 small-joint	 ankylosis;	 osteolysis	 of	
phalangeal	and	metacarpal	bone,	with	telescoping	of	digits;	periostitis	
and	proliferative	new	bone	at	sites	of	enthesitis;	and	a	“ray”	distribution	
of	lesions.	Characteristics	of	axial	PsA	that	differ	from	idiopathic	AS	
include	asymmetric	sacroiliitis;	less	facet	joint	arthritis;	nonmarginal,	
bulky,	 “comma”-shaped	 syndesmophytes	 that	 tend	 to	 be	 fewer,	 less	
symmetric,	and	less	delicate	than	the	marginal	syndesmophytes	of	AS;	
fluffy	 hyperperiostosis	 on	 anterior	 vertebral	 bodies;	 severe	 cervical	
spine	involvement,	with	a	tendency	to	atlantoaxial	subluxation	but	rela-
tive	sparing	of	the	thoracolumbar	spine;	and	paravertebral	ossification.	
Ultrasound	and	MRI	both	readily	demonstrate	enthesitis	and	tendon	
sheath	effusions	that	can	be	difficult	to	assess	on	physical	examination.	
A	recent	MRI	study	of	68	PsA	patients	found	sacroiliitis	in	35%,	unre-
lated	to	B27	but	correlated	with	restricted	spinal	movement.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Classification	criteria	for	PsA	were	published	in	2006	(Classification	
of	 Psoriatic	 Arthritis	 [CASPAR]	 criteria)	 (Table  362-2).	 The	 sensi-
tivity	and	specificity	of	these	criteria	exceed	90%,	and	they	are	useful	
in	 clinical	 practice	 as	 a	 guide	 for	 early	 diagnosis.	 Diagnosis	 can	 be	
challenging	 when	 the	 arthritis	 precedes	 psoriasis,	 the	 psoriasis	 is	
undiagnosed	or	obscure,	or	the	joint	involvement	closely	resembles	
another	form	of	arthritis.	A	high	index	of	suspicion	is	needed	in	any	
patient	 with	 an	 undiagnosed	 inflammatory	 arthritis.	 The	 history	
should	 include	 inquiry	 about	 psoriasis	 in	 the	 patient	 and	 family	
members.	 Patients	 should	 be	 examined	 disrobed,	 and	 psoriasiform	
lesions	 should	 be	 sought	 in	 the	 scalp,	 ears,	 umbilicus,	 and	 gluteal	
folds	in	addition	to	more	accessible	sites;	the	fingernails	and	toenails	
should	also	be	carefully	examined.	Axial	symptoms	or	signs,	dactyli-
tis,	enthesitis,	ankylosis,	the	pattern	of	joint	involvement,	and	char-
acteristic	radiographic	changes	can	be	helpful	clues.	The	differential	
diagnosis	includes	all	other	forms	of	arthritis,	which	can	occur	coin-
cidentally	in	individuals	with	psoriasis.	The	differential	diagnosis	of	
isolated	DIP	involvement	is	short.	Osteoarthritis	(Heberden’s	nodes)	
is	usually	not	inflammatory;	gout	involving	more	than	one	DIP	joint	
often	involves	other	sites	and	may	be	accompanied	by	tophi;	the	very	
rare	 entity	 multicentric	 reticulohistiocytosis	 involves	 other	 joints	
and	has	characteristic	small	pearly	periungual	skin	nodules;	and	the	
uncommon	entity,	inflammatory	osteoarthritis,	like	the	others,	lacks	
the	nail	changes	of	PsA.	Radiography	can	be	helpful	in	all	these	cases,	

TABLE 362-2  The CASPAR (Classification Criteria for Psoriatic 
Arthritis) Criteriaa
To meet the CASPAR criteria, a patient must have inflammatory articular 
disease (joint, spine, or entheseal) with ≥3 points from any of the following five 
categories:
1.  Evidence of current psoriasis,b,c a personal history of psoriasis, or a family 

history of psoriasisd

2.  Typical psoriatic nail dystrophye observed on current physical examination
3.  A negative test result for rheumatoid factor
4.  Either current dactylitisf or a history of dactylitis recorded by a rheumatologist
5.  Radiographic evidence of juxtaarticular new bone formationg in the hand or 

foot

aSpecificity of 99% and sensitivity of 91%. bCurrent psoriasis is assigned 2 points; 
all other features are assigned 1 point. cPsoriatic skin or scalp disease present 
at the time of examination, as judged by a rheumatologist or dermatologist. 
dHistory of psoriasis in a first- or second-degree relative. eOnycholysis, pitting, 
or hyperkeratosis. fSwelling of an entire digit. gIll-defined ossification near joint 
margins, excluding osteophyte formation.

and	 in	 distinguishing	 between	 psoriatic	 spondylitis	 and	 idiopathic	
AS.	 A	 history	 of	 trauma	 to	 an	 affected	 joint	 preceding	 the	 onset	 of	
arthritis	 may	 occur	 more	 frequently	 in	 PsA	 than	 in	 other	 types	 of	
arthritis,	perhaps	reflecting	the	Koebner	phenomenon	in	which	pso-
riatic	skin	lesions	arise	at	sites	of	skin	trauma.

TREATMENT
Psoriatic Arthritis

Ideally,	coordinated	therapy	is	directed	at	both	the	skin	and	joints	in	
PsA,	and	biologic	agents	have	dramatically	facilitated	this	goal.	This	
was	first	observed	with	anti-TNF	agents,	with	prompt	and	dramatic	
resolution	of	both	arthritis	and	skin	lesions	observed	in	large,	ran-
domized	controlled	trials	of	all	five	agents.	Many	of	the	responding	
patients	had	long-standing	disease	that	was	resistant	to	all	previous	
therapy,	 as	 well	 as	 extensive	 skin	 disease.	 The	 clinical	 response	 is	
often	more	dramatic	than	in	RA,	and	delay	of	disease	progression	
has	 been	 demonstrated	 radiographically.	 The	 potential	 additive	
effect	of	methotrexate	to	anti-TNF	agents	in	PsA	remains	uncertain.	
As	noted	above,	anti-TNF	therapy,	paradoxically,	has	been	reported	
to	trigger	exacerbation	or	de	novo	appearance	of	psoriasis,	typically	
the	 palmoplantar	 pustular	 variety.	 In	 some	 cases,	 the	 therapy	 can	
nevertheless	be	continued.

Antagonists	 of	 the	 IL-23/IL-17	 pathway	 show	 efficacy	 at	 least	
comparable	to	that	of	anti-TNF	for	PsA	and	in	some	cases	superior	
for	 psoriasis.	 Approved	 agents	 include	 secukinumab	 and	 ixeki-
zumab,	 monoclonal	 antibodies	 to	 IL-17A;	 and	 ustekinumab,	 a	
monoclonal	antibody	to	the	shared	IL-23/IL-12p40	subunit.	Three	
monoclonal	antibodies	to	IL-23	(p19	subunit)	that	are	approved	for	
plaque	psoriasis—guselkumab,	risankizumab,	and	tildrakizumab—
showed	efficacy	in	PsA	in	clinical	trials	(Fig.	362-3).

Apremilast,	 an	 oral	 phosphodiesterase-4	 inhibitor,	 is	 approved	
for	both	psoriasis	and	PsA.	Although	not	quite	as	effective	for	PsA	
as	the	biologics,	apremilast	has	a	more	favorable	safety	profile.	It	is	
not	indicated	in	patients	with	radiographically	evident	joint	damage	
or	axial	involvement.

The	oral	JAK	inhibitor,	tofacitinib,	is	approved	for	treatment	of	
PsA.	 When	 directly	 compared,	 its	 efficacy	 was	 comparable	 to	 the	
anti-TNF	agent	adalimumab.	At	least	five	other	JAK	inhibitors	are	
currently	being	studied	in	PsA	clinical	trials.

Older	treatments	for	PsA	have	been	based	on	drugs	that	have	efficacy	
in	RA	and/or	in	psoriasis.	Methotrexate	in	doses	of	15–25	mg/week	
has	 moderate	 efficacy	 for	 psoriasis,	 and	 expert	 opinion	 favors	 its	
use	in	PsA	not	requiring	biologics.	Agents	with	efficacy	in	psoriasis	
reported	to	benefit	PsA	are	cyclosporine,	retinoic	acid	derivatives,	
and	 psoralens	 plus	 ultraviolet	 A	 light	 (PUVA).	 The	 pyrimidine	
synthetase	inhibitor	leflunomide	has	been	shown	to	be	beneficial	in	
PsA,	with	modest	benefit	for	psoriasis.

All	 these	 treatments	 require	 careful	 monitoring.	 Immunosup-
pressive	therapy	may	be	used	cautiously	in	HIV-associated	PsA	if	
the	HIV	infection	is	well	controlled.

UNDIFFERENTIATED AND JUVENILE 
SPONDYLOARTHRITIS
Many	 patients	 present	 with	 one	 or	 more	 SpA	 features	 but	 lack	 suffi-
cient	findings	for	one	of	the	preceding	diagnoses.	These	patients	were	
formerly	said	to	have	undifferentiated spondyloarthritis,	or	simply	spon-
dyloarthritis,	 as	 defined	 by	 the	 1991	 European	 Spondyloarthropathy	
Study	Group	criteria.	Some	of	these	patients	may	have	ReA	in	which	
the	 triggering	 infection	 remains	 clinically	 silent.	 In	 other	 cases,	 the	
patient	may	subsequently	develop	IBD	or	psoriasis.	The	diagnosis	of	
undifferentiated	SpA	was	commonly	applied	to	patients	with	periph-
eral	arthritis	and/or	enthesitis,	and	to	patients	with	IBP	and	other	SpA	
features	who	did	meet	radiographic	criteria	for	AS.	Many	of	these	latter	
patients	would	now	be	classified	as	nr-axSpA	(Table	362-1).

Comparable	 to	 the	 classification	 criteria	 for	 axial	 SpA,	 the	 ASAS	
has	formulated	criteria	for	peripheral	SpA.	This	is	intended	to	exclude	
patients	with	axial	symptoms	and	thus	to	divide	the	universe	of	patients

with	SpA	into	predominantly	axial	and	predominantly	peripheral	sub-
sets.	These	criteria	are	shown	in	Table 362-3.

In	juvenile	SpA,	which	usually	begins	between	ages	7	and	16	years,	an	
asymmetric,	predominantly	lower-extremity	oligoarthritis	and	enthes-
itis	without	extraarticular	features	is	the	typical	mode	of	presentation.	
This	condition	is	termed	the	seronegative enthesitis and arthritis	(SEA)	
syndrome.	There	is	male	predominance	(60–80%),	and	the	prevalence	
of	B27	is	~80%.	Despite	the	absence	of	axial	symptoms,	active	sacroili-
itis	by	MRI	has	commonly	been	found	at	diagnosis.	Many,	but	not	all,	
of	these	patients	go	on	to	develop	AS	in	late	adolescence	or	adulthood.
Management	of	peripheral	SpA	is	similar	to	that	of	the	other	spon-
dyloarthritides.	Biologic	therapy	is	indicated	in	severe,	persistent	cases	
not	responsive	to	other	treatment.

Current	pediatric	literature	should	be	consulted	for	information	on	

management	of	juvenile	SpA.

IBD-ASSOCIATED ARTHRITIS
 ■ HISTORIC BACKGROUND
The	relationship	between	arthritis	and	IBD,	first	observed	in	the	1930s,	
was	further	defined	by	epidemiologic	studies	in	the	1950s	and	1960s,	
and	included	in	the	concept	of	the	spondyloarthritides	in	the	1970s.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Both	common	forms	of	IBD,	ulcerative	colitis	(UC)	and	Crohn’s	disease	
(CD)	(Chap. 326),	are	associated	with	SpA.	UC	and	CD	both	have	an	
estimated	prevalence	of	0.1–0.2%,	and	the	incidence	of	each	is	thought	
to	have	increased	in	recent	decades.	Both	axial	and	peripheral	SpA	are	
associated	with	UC	and	CD.	Wide	variations	have	been	reported	in	the	
estimated	 frequencies	 of	 these	 associations.	 In	 recent	 series,	 AS	 was	
diagnosed	 in	 1–10%,	 and	 peripheral	 arthritis	 in	 10–50%	 of	 patients	
with	 IBD.	 IBP	 and	 enthesitis	 are	 common,	 and	 many	 patients	 have	
sacroiliitis	on	imaging	studies.

The	prevalence	of	UC	or	CD	in	patients	with	AS	is	thought	to	be	
5–10%,	 and	 a	 recent	 meta-analysis	 found	 the	 prevalence	 in	 patients	
with	nr-axSpA	to	be	6.4%.	However,	investigation	of	unselected	SpA	
patients	 by	 ileocolonoscopy	 has	 revealed	 that	 up	 to	 two-thirds	 of	
patients	with	AS	have	subclinical	intestinal	inflammation	that	is	evi-
dent	 either	 macroscopically	 or	 histologically.	 These	 lesions	 have	 also	
been	found	in	patients	with	undifferentiated	SpA	or	ReA	(both	enteri-
cally	and	urogenitally	acquired).

Both	UC	and	CD	show	familial	aggregation,	more	so	for	CD.	HLA	
associations	 have	 been	 weak	 and	 inconsistent.	 HLA-B27	 is	 found	 in	
up	to	70%	of	patients	with	IBD	and	AS,	but	in	≤15%	of	patients	with	
IBD	and	peripheral	arthritis	or	IBD	alone.	Three	alleles	of	the	NOD2/

CARD15	gene	have	been	found	in	approximately	one-half	of	patients	
with	CD.	These	alleles	are	not	associated	with	SpA	per	se.	In	addition,	
more	than	200	other	genes	have	been	found	to	be	associated	with	CD,	
UC,	or	both.	Many	of	the	SNPs	associated	with	AS	are	also	associated	
with	IBD,	almost	all	with	the	same	direction	of	association.	Overall,	the	
genetic	correlation	of	AS	is	0.49	with	CD	and	0.47	with	UC.

 ■ PATHOLOGY
Available	data	for	IBD-associated	peripheral	arthritis	suggest	a	synovial	
histology	similar	to	other	forms	of	SpA.	Association	with	arthritis	does	
not	affect	the	gut	histology	of	UC	or	CD	(Chap. 326).	The	subclinical	
inflammatory	lesions	in	the	colon	and	distal	ileum	associated	with	SpA	
are	 classified	 as	 either	 acute	 or	 chronic.	 The	 former	 resembles	 acute	
bacterial	 enteritis,	 with	 largely	 intact	 architecture	 and	 neutrophilic	
infiltration	in	the	lamina	propria.	The	latter	resemble	the	lesions	of	CD,	
with	distortion	of	villi	and	crypts,	aphthoid	ulceration,	and	mononu-
clear	cell	infiltration	in	the	lamina	propria.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS
Both	 IBD	 and	 SpA	 are	 immune-mediated,	 and	 the	 shared	 genetics	
presumably	 reflect	 shared	 pathogenic	 mechanisms,	 but	 the	 specific	
connection	 between	 them	 remains	 obscure.	 Rodent	 models	 showing	
various	immune	perturbations	manifest	both	IBD	and	arthritis.	Resi-
dent	innate	immune	cells	and	intestinal	dysbiosis	have	been	implicated	
in	 both	 conditions.	 Several	 lines	 of	 evidence	 indicate	 trafficking	 of	
leukocytes	 between	 the	 gut	 and	 the	 joint.	 Mucosal	 leukocytes	 from	
IBD	patients	have	been	shown	to	bind	avidly	to	synovial	vasculature	
through	several	different	adhesion	molecules.	Macrophages	expressing	
CD163	 are	 prominent	 in	 the	 inflammatory	 lesions	 of	 both	 gut	 and	
synovium	in	the	spondyloarthritides.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
AS	associated	with	IBD	is	clinically	indistinguishable	from	idiopathic	
AS.	 It	 runs	 a	 course	 independent	 of	 the	 bowel	 disease,	 and	 in	 some	
patients,	 it	 precedes	 the	 onset	 of	 IBD.	 Peripheral	 arthritis	 may	 also	
begin	before	onset	of	overt	bowel	disease.	The	spectrum	of	peripheral	
arthritis	includes	acute	self-limited	attacks	of	oligoarthritis	that	often	
coincide	with	relapses	of	IBD,	and	more	chronic	and	symmetric	pol-
yarticular	 arthritis	 that	 runs	 an	 independent	 course.	 The	 patterns	 of	
joint	involvement	are	similar	in	UC	and	CD.	In	general,	erosions	and	
deformities	are	infrequent	in	IBD-associated	peripheral	arthritis.	Iso-
lated	destructive	hip	arthritis	is	a	rare	complication	of	CD,	apparently	
distinct	from	osteonecrosis	and	septic	arthritis.	Dactylitis	and	entheso-
pathy	are	occasionally	found.	In	addition	to	the	~20%	of	IBD	patients	
with	 SpA,	 a	 comparable	 percentage	 have	 arthralgias	 or	 fibromyalgia	
symptoms.

Other	extraintestinal	manifestations	of	IBD	are	seen	in	addition	to	
arthritis,	 including	 uveitis,	 psoriasis,	 pyoderma	 gangrenosum,	 eryth-
ema	nodosum,	pulmonary	nodules,	and	clubbing,	all	somewhat	more	
commonly	in	CD	than	UC.	The	uveitis	shares	the	features	described	
above	for	PsA-associated	uveitis.

 ■ LABORATORY AND RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS
Laboratory	findings	reflect	the	inflammatory	and	metabolic	manifes-
tations	 of	 IBD.	 Joint	 fluid	 is	 usually	 at	 least	 mildly	 inflammatory.	 Of	
patients	 with	 AS	 and	 IBD,	 30–70%	 carry	 HLA-B27,	 compared	 with	
80–90%	of	patients	with	AS	alone	and	50–70%	of	those	with	AS	and	
psoriasis.	Hence,	definite	or	probable	AS	in	a	B27-negative	individual	
in	the	absence	of	psoriasis	should	raise	concern	for	occult	IBD.	Radio-
graphic	changes	in	the	axial	skeleton	are	the	same	as	in	uncomplicated	
AS.	 Erosions	 are	 uncommon	 in	 peripheral	 arthritis	 but	 may	 occur,	
particularly	in	the	metatarsophalangeal	joints.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Diarrhea	and	arthritis	are	both	common	conditions	that	can	coexist	for	
a	variety	of	reasons.	When	etiopathogenically	related,	ReA	and	IBD-	
associated	arthritis	are	the	most	common	causes.	Rare	causes	include	
celiac	 disease	 and	 Whipple’s	 disease.	 Behcet’s	 disease	 can	 mimic	 CD	
and	cause	arthritis.	In	most	cases,	diagnosis	depends	on	investigation	
of	the	bowel	disease.

TREATMENT
IBD-Associated Arthritis

Treatment	of	CD	has	been	improved	by	anti-TNF	agents.	Infliximab,	
adalimumab,	and	certolizumab	pegol	are	effective	for	induction	and	
maintenance	of	clinical	remission	in	CD,	and	infliximab	is	effective	
in	 fistulizing	 CD.	 IBD-associated	 arthritis	 also	 responds	 to	 these	
agents.	Other	biologics	with	efficacy	in	IBD	that	may	have	efficacy	
for	 peripheral	 arthritis	 include	 ustekinumab	 (anti-IL12/23)	 and	
risankizumab	(anti-IL-23),	but	anti-IL-17	therapy	is	not	indicated	
(Fig.	 362-3).	 Tofacitinib	 is	 approved	 for	 treatment	 of	 UC.	 Other	
promising	JAK	inhibitors	include	upadacitinib	and	filgotinib.	Other	
treatments	for	IBD	include	sulfasalazine	and	related	drugs	as	well	
as	 systemic	 and	 local	 glucocorticoids.	 NSAIDs,	 especially	 COX-	
selective	 formulations,	 are	 helpful	 for	 arthritis	 and	 generally	 well	
tolerated,	 but	 they	 can	 precipitate	 IBD	 flares.	 As	 noted	 above	 for	
psoriasis,	rare	cases	of	IBD,	either	CD	or	UC,	have	apparently	been	
precipitated	by	anti-TNF	therapy.	Vedolizumab	is	a	gut-selective	
integrin	 inhibitor	 approved	 for	 both	 CD	 and	 UC.	 It	 is	 not	 given	
specifically	 for	 joint	 disease,	 but	 coexistent	 arthritis	 can	 improve	
during	treatment	of	the	IBD.	However,	there	are	many	reports	of	de	
novo	or	flaring	arthritis,	either	axial	or	peripheral,	in	IBD	patients	
treated	with	vedolizumab.

SAPHO SYNDROME
The	syndrome	of	synovitis,	acne,	pustulosis,	hyperostosis,	and	osteitis	
(SAPHO)	 is	 characterized	 by	 a	 variety	 of	 skin	 and	 musculoskeletal	
manifestations.	 Dermatologic	 manifestations	 include	 palmoplantar	
pustulosis,	 acne	 conglobata,	 acne	 fulminans,	 and	 hidradenitis	 sup-
purativa.	The	main	musculoskeletal	findings	are	sternoclavicular	and	
spinal	hyperostosis,	chronic	recurrent	foci	of	sterile	osteomyelitis,	and	
axial	 or	 peripheral	 arthritis.	 Cases	 with	 one	 or	 a	 few	 manifestations	
are	 probably	 the	 rule.	 The	 ESR	 and/or	 CRP	 are	 usually	 mildly	 to	
moderately	 elevated,	 occasionally	 dramatically.	 Bacteria,	 most	 often	
Propionibacterium acnes,	have	been	cultured	from	bone	biopsy	speci-
mens	and	occasionally	other	sites.	IBD	was	coexistent	in	8%	of	patients	
in	one	large	series.	No	gene	associations	have	been	found,	despite	the	
resemblance	to	autoinflammatory	syndromes.	Radionuclide	bone	scan	
is	 very	 helpful	 diagnostically,	 often	 showing	 the	 classic	 “bull’s	 head”	
sign	 involving	 the	 sternoclavicular	 joints	 and	 clavicles.	 High-dose	
NSAIDs	may	provide	relief	from	bone	pain.	Uncontrolled	series	and	
case	 reports	 describe	 successful	 therapy	 with	 pamidronate	 or	 other	
bisphosphonates.	 Anecdotal	 benefit	 from	 biologic	 agents	 has	 been	
reported,	 including	 anti-TNF,	 anti-IL-17A,	 anti-IL-12/23,	 anti-IL-6,	
and	anti-IL-1	agents.	Successful	prolonged	antibiotic	therapy	has	also	
been	reported.

363 The Vasculitis Syndromes

Carol A. Langford, Anthony S. Fauci

DEFINITION
Vasculitis	is	a	clinicopathologic	process	characterized	by	inflammation	
of	and	damage	to	blood	vessels.	The	vessel	lumen	is	usually	compro-
mised,	and	this	is	associated	with	ischemia	of	the	tissues	supplied	by	
the	 involved	 vessel.	 A	 broad	 and	 heterogeneous	 group	 of	 syndromes	
may	result	from	this	process,	since	any	type,	size,	and	location	of	blood	
vessel	may	be	involved.	Vasculitis	and	its	consequences	may	be	the	pri-
mary	or	sole	manifestation	of	a	disease;	alternatively,	vasculitis	may	be	
a	secondary	component	of	another	disease.	Vasculitis	may	be	confined	
to	 a	 single	 organ,	 such	 as	 the	 skin,	 or	 it	 may	 simultaneously	 involve	
several	organ	systems.

CLASSIFICATION
A	major	feature	of	the	vasculitic	syndromes	as	a	group	is	the	fact	that	
there	is	a	great	deal	of	heterogeneity	at	the	same	time	as	there	is	con-
siderable	 overlap	 among	 them.	 Table  363-1	 lists	 the	 major	 vasculitis

syndromes.	The	distinguishing	and	overlapping	features	of	these	syn-
dromes	are	discussed	below.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Generally,	most	of	the	vasculitic	syndromes	are	assumed	to	be	medi-
ated	at	least	in	part	by	immunopathogenic	mechanisms	that	occur	in	
response	 to	 certain	 antigenic	 stimuli.	 However,	 evidence	 supporting	
this	 hypothesis	 is	 for	 the	 most	 part	 indirect	 and	 may	 reflect	 epiphe-
nomena	as	opposed	to	true	causality.	Furthermore,	it	is	unknown	why	
some	individuals	might	develop	vasculitis	in	response	to	certain	anti-
genic	stimuli,	whereas	others	do	not.	It	is	likely	that	a	number	of	factors	
are	involved	in	the	ultimate	expression	of	a	vasculitic	syndrome.	These	
include	the	genetic	predisposition,	environmental	exposures,	and	the	
regulatory	 mechanisms	 associated	 with	 immune	 response	 to	 certain	
antigens.	Although	immune	complex	formation,	antineutrophil	cyto-
plasmic	antibodies	(ANCA),	and	pathogenic	T	lymphocyte	responses	
(Table 363-2)	have	been	among	the	prominent	hypothesized	mecha-
nisms,	it	is	likely	that	the	pathogenesis	of	individual	forms	of	vasculitis	
is	complex	and	varied.
 ■ PATHOGENIC IMMUNE-COMPLEX FORMATION
Deposition	 of	 immune	 complexes	 was	 the	 first	 and	 most	 widely	
accepted	pathogenic	mechanism	of	vasculitis.	However,	the	causal	role	
of	immune	complexes	has	not	been	clearly	established	in	most	of	the	
vasculitic	syndromes.	Circulating	immune	complexes	need	not	result	
in	deposition	of	the	complexes	in	blood	vessels	with	ensuing	vasculitis,	
and	 many	 patients	 with	 active	 vasculitis	 do	 not	 have	 demonstrable	
circulating	or	deposited	immune	complexes.	The	actual	antigen	con-
tained	in	the	immune	complex	has	only	rarely	been	identified	in	vascu-
litic	syndromes.	In	this	regard,	hepatitis	B	antigen	has	been	identified	
in	both	the	circulating	and	deposited	immune	complexes	in	a	subset	
of	patients	who	have	features	of	a	systemic	vasculitis	clinically	similar	
to	polyarteritis	nodosa	(see	“Polyarteritis	Nodosa”).	Cryoglobulinemic	
vasculitis	 is	 strongly	 associated	 with	 hepatitis	 C	 virus	 infection;	
hepatitis	C	virions	and	hepatitis	C	virus	antigen-antibody	complexes	
have	 been	 identified	 in	 the	 cryoprecipitates	 of	 these	 patients	 (see	
“Cryoglobulinemic	Vasculitis”).

The	 mechanisms	 of	 tissue	 damage	 in	 immune	 complex–mediated	
vasculitis	resemble	those	described	for	serum	sickness.	In	this	model,	
antigen-antibody	 complexes	 are	 formed	 in	 antigen	 excess	 and	 are	
deposited	 in	 vessel	 walls	 whose	 permeability	 has	 been	 increased	 by	
vasoactive	 amines	 such	 as	 histamine,	 bradykinin,	 and	 leukotrienes	
released	from	platelets	or	from	mast	cells	as	a	result	of	IgE-triggered	
mechanisms.	The	deposition	of	complexes	results	in	activation	of	com-
plement	components,	particularly	C5a,	which	is	strongly	chemotactic	
for	neutrophils.	These	cells	then	infiltrate	the	vessel	wall,	phagocytose	
the	 immune	 complexes,	 and	 release	 their	 intracytoplasmic	 enzymes,

which	 damage	 the	 vessel	 wall.	 As	 the	 process	 becomes	 subacute	 or	
chronic,	 mononuclear	 cells	 infiltrate	 the	 vessel	 wall.	 The	 common	
denominator	 of	 the	 resulting	 syndrome	 is	 compromise	 of	 the	 vessel	
lumen	 with	 ischemic	 changes	 in	 the	 tissues	 supplied	 by	 the	 involved	
vessel.	Several	variables	may	explain	why	only	certain	types	of	immune	
complexes	 cause	 vasculitis	 and	 why	 only	 certain	 vessels	 are	 affected	
in	 individual	 patients.	 These	 include	 the	 ability	 of	 the	 reticuloendo-
thelial	system	to	clear	circulating	complexes	from	the	blood,	the	size	
and	 physicochemical	 properties	 of	 immune	 complexes,	 the	 relative	
degree	 of	 turbulence	 of	 blood	 flow,	 the	 intravascular	 hydrostatic	
pressure	in	different	vessels,	and	the	preexisting	integrity	of	the	vessel	
endothelium.

 ■ ANTINEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODIES
ANCA	are	antibodies	directed	against	certain	proteins	in	the	cytoplas-
mic	granules	of	neutrophils	and	monocytes.	These	autoantibodies	are	
present	 in	 a	 high	 percentage	 of	 patients	 with	 active	 granulomatosis	
with	 polyangiitis	 and	 microscopic	 polyangiitis	 and	 in	 a	 lower	 per-
centage	of	patients	with	eosinophilic	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	
(Churg-Strauss).	Because	these	diseases	share	the	presence	of	ANCA	
and	 small-vessel	 vasculitis,	 they	 have	 been	 grouped	 collectively	 as	
“ANCA-associated	vasculitis.”	However,	these	diseases	possess	unique	
clinical	 phenotypes,	 such	 that	 they	 should	 continue	 to	 be	 viewed	 as	
separate	entities.

There	are	two	major	categories	of	ANCA	based	on	different	targets	
for	 the	 antibodies.	 The	 terminology	 of	 cytoplasmic  ANCA	 (cANCA)	
refers	 to	 the	 diffuse,	 granular	 cytoplasmic	 staining	 pattern	 observed	
by	 immunofluorescence	 microscopy	 when	 serum	 antibodies	 bind	 to	
indicator	neutrophils.	Proteinase-3,	a	29-kDa	neutral	serine	proteinase	
present	in	neutrophil	azurophilic	granules,	is	the	major	cANCA	antigen.	
More	than	90%	of	patients	with	active	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	
have	detectable	antibodies	to	proteinase-3	(see	below).	The	terminology	
of	perinuclear ANCA	(pANCA)	refers	to	the	more	localized	perinuclear	
or	 nuclear	 staining	 pattern	 of	 the	 indicator	 neutrophils.	 The	 major	
target	 for	 pANCA	 is	 the	 enzyme	 myeloperoxidase;	 other	 targets	 that	
can	produce	a	pANCA	pattern	of	staining	include	elastase,	cathepsin	G,	
lactoferrin,	lysozyme,	and	bactericidal/permeability-increasing	protein.	
However,	only	antibodies	to	myeloperoxidase	have	been	convincingly	
associated	with	vasculitis.	Antimyeloperoxidase	antibodies	have	been	
reported	to	occur	in	variable	percentages	of	patients	with	microscopic	
polyangiitis,	 eosinophilic	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 (Churg-
Strauss),	isolated	necrotizing	crescentic	glomerulonephritis,	and	gran-
ulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	(see	below).	A	pANCA	pattern	of	staining	
that	is	not	due	to	antimyeloperoxidase	antibodies	has	been	associated	
with	 nonvasculitic	 entities	 such	 as	 rheumatic	 and	 nonrheumatic	
autoimmune	 diseases,	 inflammatory	 bowel	 disease,	 certain	 drugs,	
and	infections	such	as	endocarditis	and	bacterial	airway	infections	in	
patients	with	cystic	fibrosis.

It	is	unclear	why	patients	with	these	vasculitis	syndromes	develop	
antibodies	 to	 myeloperoxidase	 or	 proteinase-3	 or	 what	 role	 these	
antibodies	play	in	disease	pathogenesis.	There	are	a	number	of	in	vitro	
observations	 that	 suggest	 possible	 mechanisms	 whereby	 these	 anti-
bodies	can	contribute	to	the	pathogenesis	of	the	vasculitis	syndromes.	
Proteinase-3	 and	 myeloperoxidase	 reside	 in	 the	 azurophilic	 granules	
and	lysosomes	of	resting	neutrophils	and	monocytes,	where	they	are	
apparently	 inaccessible	 to	 serum	 antibodies.	 However,	 when	 neu-
trophils	or	monocytes	are	primed	by	tumor	necrosis	factor	α	(TNF-α)	
or	interleukin	1	(IL-1),	proteinase-3	and	myeloperoxidase	translocate	
to	 the	 cell	 membrane,	 where	 they	 can	 interact	 with	 extracellular	
ANCA.	The	neutrophils	then	degranulate	and	produce	reactive	oxygen	
species	 that	 can	 cause	 tissue	 damage.	 Furthermore,	 ANCA-activated	
neutrophils	can	adhere	to	and	kill	endothelial	cells	in	vitro.	Activation	
of	 neutrophils	 and	 monocytes	 by	 ANCA	 also	 induces	 the	 release	 of	
proinflammatory	 cytokines	 such	 as	 IL-1	 and	 IL-8.	 Adoptive	 transfer	
experiments	 in	 genetically	 engineered	 mice	 provide	 further	 evidence	
for	a	direct	pathogenic	role	of	ANCA	in	vivo.	In	contradiction,	how-
ever,	a	number	of	clinical	and	laboratory	observations	argue	against	a	
primary	pathogenic	role	for	ANCA.	Patients	may	have	active	granulo-
matosis	with	polyangiitis	in	the	absence	of	ANCA;	the	absolute	height

patients	with	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	in	remission	may	con-
tinue	to	have	high	ANCA	levels	for	years	(see	below).

 ■ PATHOGENIC T LYMPHOCYTE RESPONSES AND 
GRANULOMA FORMATION
The	histopathologic	feature	of	granulomatous	vasculitis	has	provided	
evidence	to	support	a	role	of	pathogenic	T	lymphocyte	responses	and	
cell-mediated	 immune	 injury.	 Vascular	 endothelial	 cells	 can	 express	
human	 leukocyte	 antigen	 (HLA)	 class	 II	 molecules	 following	 activa-
tion	by	cytokines	such	as	interferon	(IFN)	γ.	This	allows	these	cells	to	
participate	 in	 immunologic	 reactions	 such	 as	 interaction	 with	 CD4+		
T	lymphocytes	in	a	manner	similar	to	antigen-presenting	macrophages.	
Endothelial	cells	can	secrete	IL-1,	which	may	activate	T	lymphocytes	
and	 initiate	 or	 propagate	 in	 situ	 immunologic	 processes	 within	 the	
blood	 vessel.	 In	 addition,	 IL-1	 and	 TNF-α	 are	 potent	 inducers	 of		
endothelial-leukocyte	adhesion	molecule	1	(ELAM-1)	and	vascular	cell	
adhesion	molecule	1	(VCAM-1),	which	may	enhance	the	adhesion	of	
leukocytes	to	endothelial	cells	in	the	blood	vessel	wall.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
General Principles of Diagnosis

The	 diagnosis	 of	 vasculitis	 should	 be	 considered	 in	 any	 patient	
with	 an	 unexplained	 systemic	 illness.	 However,	 there	 are	 certain	
clinical	abnormalities	that	when	present	alone	or	in	combination	
should	 suggest	 a	 diagnosis	 of	 vasculitis.	 These	 include	 palpa-
ble	 purpura,	 pulmonary	 infiltrates	 and	 microscopic	 hematuria,	
chronic	 inflammatory	 sinusitis,	 mononeuritis	 multiplex,	 unex-
plained	ischemic	events,	and	glomerulonephritis	with	evidence	of	
multisystem	disease.	A	number	of	nonvasculitic	diseases	may	also	
produce	some	or	all	of	these	abnormalities.	Thus,	the	first	step	in	
the	workup	of	a	patient	with	suspected	vasculitis	is	to	exclude	other	
diseases	that	produce	clinical	manifestations	that	can	mimic	vascu-
litis	(Table 363-3).	It	is	particularly	important	to	exclude	infectious	
diseases	with	features	that	overlap	those	of	vasculitis,	especially	if	
the	patient’s	clinical	condition	is	deteriorating	rapidly	and	empiri-
cal	immunosuppressive	treatment	is	being	contemplated.

Once	 diseases	 that	 mimic	 vasculitis	 have	 been	 excluded,	 the	
workup	should	follow	a	series	of	progressive	steps	that	establish	the	
diagnosis	of	vasculitis	and	determine,	where	possible,	the	category	
of	the	vasculitis	syndrome	(Fig. 363-1).	This	approach	is	of	consid-
erable	importance	since	several	of	the	vasculitis	syndromes	require	
aggressive	therapy	with	glucocorticoids	and	other	immunosuppres-
sive	agents,	whereas	other	syndromes	usually	resolve	spontaneously	
and	require	symptomatic	treatment	only.	The	definitive	diagnosis	
of	 vasculitis	 is	 usually	 made	 based	 on	 biopsy	 of	 involved	 tissue.	
The	yield	of	“blind”	biopsies	of	organs	with	no	subjective	or	objec-
tive	 evidence	 of	 involvement	 is	 very	 low	 and	 should	 be	 avoided.	
When	 syndromes	 such	 as	 polyarteritis	 nodosa,	 Takayasu	 arteri-
tis,	 or	 primary	 central	 nervous	 system	 (CNS)	 vasculitis	 are	 sus-
pected,	 arteriogram	 of	 organs	 with	 suspected	 involvement	 should	
be	performed. 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT
Once	 a	 diagnosis	 of	 vasculitis	 has	 been	 established,	 a	 decision	
regarding	 therapeutic	 strategy	 must	 be	 made	 (Fig.	 363-1).	 If	 an	
offending	antigen	that	precipitates	the	vasculitis	is	recognized,	the	
antigen	should	be	removed	where	possible.	If	the	vasculitis	is	asso-
ciated	with	an	underlying	disease	such	as	an	infection,	neoplasm,	or	
connective	tissue	disease,	the	underlying	disease	should	be	treated.	
If	the	syndrome	represents	a	primary	vasculitic	disease,	treatment	
should	be	initiated	according	to	the	category	of	the	vasculitis	syn-
drome.	 Specific	 therapeutic	 regimens	 are	 discussed	 below	 for	 the	
individual	 vasculitis	 syndromes;	 however,	 certain	 general	 princi-
ples	 regarding	 therapy	 should	 be	 considered.	 Decisions	 regarding	
treatment	should	be	based	on	the	use	of	regimens	for	which	there

has	 been	 published	 literature	 supporting	 efficacy	 for	 that	 par-
ticular	 vasculitic	 disease.	 Since	 the	 potential	 toxic	 side	 effects	 of	
certain	 therapeutic	 regimens	 may	 be	 substantial,	 the	 risk-versus-	
benefit	ratio	of	any	therapeutic	approach	should	be	weighed	care-
fully.	 Glucocorticoids	 and/or	 other	 immunosuppressive	 agents	
should	 be	 instituted	 immediately	 in	 diseases	 where	 irreversible	
organ	system	dysfunction	and	high	morbidity	and	mortality	rates	
have	 been	 clearly	 established.	 Granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	
is	 the	 prototype	 of	 a	 severe	 systemic	 vasculitis	 requiring	 such	 a	
therapeutic	 approach	 (see	 below).	 Conversely,	 aggressive	 therapy	
should	be	avoided	for	vasculitic	manifestations	that	rarely	result	in	
irreversible	 organ	 system	 dysfunction	 such	 as	 isolated	 idiopathic	
cutaneous	 vasculitis.	 Glucocorticoids	 should	 be	 initiated	 in	 those	
systemic	vasculitides	that	cannot	be	specifically	categorized	or	for	
which	there	is	no	established	standard	therapy,	with	other	immu-
nosuppressive	agents	being	added	if	an	adequate	response	does	not	
result	or	if	remission	can	only	be	achieved	and	maintained	with	an	
unacceptably	toxic	regimen	of	glucocorticoids.	When	remission	is	
achieved,	one	should	continually	attempt	to	taper	glucocorticoids	
and	discontinue	when	possible.	When	using	other	immunosuppres-
sive	regimens,	one	should	base	the	choice	of	agent	upon	the	avail-
able	therapeutic	data	supporting	efficacy	in	that	disease,	the	site	and	
severity	of	organ	involvement,	and	the	toxicity	profile	of	the	drug.
Physicians	 should	 be	 thoroughly	 aware	 of	 the	 acute	 and	 long-
term	side	effects	associated	with	the	agents	that	are	commonly	used	
to	treat	different	forms	of	vasculitis	(Table 363-4).

Morbidity	and	mortality	can	occur	as	a	result	of	treatment,	and	
strategies	to	monitor	for	and	prevent	toxicity	represent	an	essential	
part	of	patient	care.

Addressing	 the	 risk	 of	 bone	 loss	 is	 important	 in	 all	 patients	
receiving	glucocorticoids.	Daily	cyclophosphamide	should	be	taken	
all	at	once	in	the	morning	with	a	large	amount	of	fluid	throughout	
the	 day	 to	 reduce	 the	 risk	 of	 bladder	 injury,	 and	 monitoring	 for	
bladder	cancer	should	continue	indefinitely.

Maintaining	the	white	blood	cell	(WBC)	count	at	>3000/μL	and	
the	 neutrophil	 count	 at	 >1500/μL	 is	 essential	 to	 reduce	 the	 risk	
of	 life-threatening	 infections.	 Monitoring	 of	 the	 complete	 blood	
count	every	1–2	weeks	for	as	long	as	the	patient	receives	cyclophos-
phamide	 can	 effectively	 prevent	 cytopenias.	 Methotrexate,	 azathi-
oprine,	 and	 mycophenolate	 mofetil	 are	 also	 associated	 with	 bone	
marrow	suppression,	and	complete	blood	counts	should	be	obtained	
every	1–2	weeks	for	the	first	1–2	months	after	their	initiation	and	
once	 a	 month	 thereafter.	 To	 lessen	 toxicity,	 methotrexate	 is	 often	
given	together	with	folic	acid,	1	mg	daily,	or	folinic	acid,	5–10	mg		
once	 a	 week	 24	 h	 following	 methotrexate.	 Methotrexate	 is	 elimi-
nated	 by	 the	 kidney	 and	 contraindicated	 in	 renal	 insufficiency	 as	
this	increases	the	risk	for	toxicity.	Prior	to	initiation	of	azathioprine,	
thiopurine	methyltransferase	(TPMT),	an	enzyme	involved	in	the	
metabolism	of	azathioprine,	should	be	assayed	because	inadequate	
levels	may	result	in	severe	cytopenia.

Rituximab	can	be	associated	with	infusion	reactions.	In	addition	
to	 administering	 this	 within	 a	 skilled	 infusion	 center,	 these	 reac-
tions	can	be	lessened	by	the	use	of	premedications.	There	is	a	risk	of	
hepatitis	B	reactivation	with	rituximab	such	that	all	patients	should	
be	screened	for	this	infection	prior	to	its	use.

Tocilizumab	 is	 associated	 with	 cytopenias,	 hepatotoxicity,	 and	
hyperlipidemia.	 Laboratory	 monitoring	 for	 drug	 toxicity	 should	
be	performed	4–8	weeks	after	start	of	therapy	and	every	3	months	
thereafter.

as	a	framework	for	the	application	of	evidence-based	approaches;	
however,	flexibility	should	be	practiced	to	provide	maximal	thera-
peutic	efficacy	with	minimal	toxic	side	effects	in	each	patient.

GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS
 ■ DEFINITION
Granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis	 is	 a	 distinct	 clinicopathologic	 entity	
characterized	 by	 granulomatous	 vasculitis	 of	 the	 upper	 and	 lower	
respiratory	tracts	together	with	glomerulonephritis.	In	addition,	vari-
able	 degrees	 of	 disseminated	 vasculitis	 involving	 both	 small	 arteries	
and	veins	may	occur.

 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
Granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 is	 an	 uncommon	 disease	 with	 an	
estimated	prevalence	of	3	per	100,000.	It	is	extremely	rare	in	blacks	com-
pared	 with	 whites;	 the	 male-to-female	 ratio	 is	 1:1.	 The	 disease	 can	 be	
seen	at	any	age;	~15%	of	patients	are	<19	years	of	age,	but	only	rarely	does	
the	disease	occur	before	adolescence;	the	mean	age	of	onset	is	~40	years.

 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The	histopathologic	hallmarks	of	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	are	
necrotizing	 vasculitis	 of	 small	 arteries	 and	 veins	 together	 with	 gran-
uloma	formation,	which	may	be	either	intravascular	or	extravascular	
(Fig. 363-2).	Lung	involvement	typically	appears	as	multiple,	bilateral,	
nodular	 cavitary	 infiltrates	 (Fig.  363-3),	 which	 on	 biopsy	 can	 reveal	
necrotizing	 granulomatous	 vasculitis.	 Upper	 airway	 lesions,	 particu-
larly	those	in	the	sinuses	and	nasopharynx,	typically	reveal	inflamma-
tion,	necrosis,	and	granuloma	formation,	with	or	without	vasculitis.

In	its	earliest	form,	renal	involvement	is	characterized	by	a	focal	and	
segmental	glomerulitis	that	may	evolve	into	a	rapidly	progressive	cres-
centic	 glomerulonephritis.	 Granuloma	 formation	 is	 only	 rarely	 seen	
on	renal	biopsy.	In	contrast	to	other	forms	of	glomerulonephritis,	evi-
dence	of	immune	complex	deposition	is	not	found	in	the	renal	lesion	
of	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis.	In	addition	to	the	classic	triad	of

of  geographic  necrosis  has  a  serpiginous  border  of  histiocytes  and  giant  cells

and lymphocytes infiltrating the wall of a small arteriole (upper right). (Courtesy of

disease	of	the	upper	and	lower	respiratory	tracts	and	kidney,	virtually	
any	organ	can	be	involved	with	vasculitis,	granuloma,	or	both.

The	 immunopathogenesis	 of	 this	 disease	 is	 unclear,	 although	 the	
involvement	of	upper	airways	and	lungs	with	granulomatous	vasculitis	
suggests	an	aberrant	cell-mediated	immune	response	to	an	exogenous	
or	 even	 endogenous	 antigen	 that	 enters	 through	 or	 resides	 in	 the	
upper	airway.	Chronic	nasal	carriage	of	Staphylococcus aureus	has	been	
reported	to	be	associated	with	a	higher	relapse	rate	of	granulomatosis	
with	polyangiitis;	however,	there	is	no	evidence	for	a	role	of	this	organ-
ism	in	the	pathogenesis	of	the	disease.

Peripheral	 blood	 mononuclear	 cells	 obtained	 from	 patients	 with	
granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 manifest	 increased	 secretion	 of	
IFN-γ	but	not	of	IL-4,	IL-5,	or	IL-10	compared	to	normal	controls.	In	
addition,	TNF-α	production	from	peripheral	blood	mononuclear	cells	
and	CD4+	T	cells	is	elevated.	Furthermore,	monocytes	from	patients	
with	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 produce	 increased	 amounts	 of	
IL-12.	These	findings	indicate	an	unbalanced	TH1-type	T-cell	cytokine	
pattern	in	this	disease	that	may	have	pathogenic	and	perhaps	ultimately	
therapeutic	implications.

A	high	percentage	of	patients	with	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	
develop	ANCA,	and	these	autoantibodies	may	play	a	role	in	the	patho-
genesis	of	this	disease	(see	above).
 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS
Involvement	of	the	upper	airways	occurs	in	95%	of	patients	with	gran-
ulomatosis	with	polyangiitis.	Patients	often	present	with	severe	upper	
respiratory	 tract	 findings	 such	 as	 paranasal	 sinus	 pain	 and	 drainage	
and	purulent	or	bloody	nasal	discharge,	with	or	without	nasal	mucosal	
ulceration	(Table 363-5).	Nasal	septal	perforation	may	follow,	leading	
to	 saddle	 nose	 deformity.	 Serous	 otitis	 media	 may	 occur	 as	 a	 result	
of	eustachian	tube	blockage.	Subglottic	stenosis	resulting	from	active	
disease	or	scarring	occurs	in	~16%	of	patients	and	may	result	in	severe	
airway	obstruction.

Pulmonary	 involvement	 (85–90%	 of	 patients)	 may	 be	 clinically	
expressed	 as	 cough,	 hemoptysis,	 dyspnea,	 and	 chest	 discomfort,	 or	
active	disease	may	be	asymptomatic	in	up	to	30%	of	cases.	Endobron-
chial	disease,	either	in	its	active	form	or	as	a	result	of	fibrous	scarring,	
may	lead	to	obstruction	with	atelectasis.

Eye	involvement	(52%	of	patients)	may	range	from	a	mild	conjunctivitis	
to	dacryocystitis,	episcleritis,	scleritis,	granulomatous	sclerouveitis,	ciliary	
vessel	vasculitis,	and	retroorbital	mass	lesions	leading	to	proptosis.

Skin	 lesions	 (46%	 of	 patients)	 appear	 as	 papules,	 vesicles,	 palpable	
purpura,	ulcers,	or	subcutaneous	nodules;	biopsy	reveals	vasculitis,	gran-
uloma,	or	both.	Cardiac	involvement	(8%	of	patients)	manifests	as	peri-
carditis,	coronary	vasculitis,	or,	rarely,	cardiomyopathy.	Nervous	system	
manifestations	(23%	of	patients)	include	cranial	neuritis,	mononeuritis	
multiplex,	or,	rarely,	cerebral	vasculitis	and/or	granuloma.

Renal	 disease	 (77%	 of	 patients)	 generally	 dominates	 the	 clinical	
picture	and,	if	left	untreated,	accounts	directly	or	indirectly	for	most	
of	the	mortality	rate	in	this	disease.	Although	it	may	smolder	in	some	
cases	as	a	mild	glomerulitis	with	proteinuria,	hematuria,	and	red	blood	
cell	 casts,	 it	 is	 clear	 that	 once	 clinically	 detectable	 renal	 functional

impairment	 occurs,	 rapidly	 progressive	 renal	 failure	 usually	 ensues	
unless	appropriate	treatment	is	instituted.

While	 the	 disease	 is	 active,	 most	 patients	 have	 nonspecific	 symp-
toms	 and	 signs	 such	 as	 malaise,	 weakness,	 arthralgias,	 anorexia,	 and	
weight	loss.	Fever	may	indicate	activity	of	the	underlying	disease	but	
more	often	reflects	secondary	infection,	usually	of	the	upper	airway.

Characteristic	 laboratory	 findings	 include	 an	 elevated	 erythrocyte	
sedimentation	rate	(ESR)	and/or	C-reactive	protein	(CRP),	mild	ane-
mia	and	leukocytosis,	mild	hypergammaglobulinemia	(particularly	of	
the	 IgA	 class),	 and	 mildly	 elevated	 rheumatoid	 factor.	 Thrombocy-
tosis	 may	 be	 seen	 as	 an	 acute-phase	 reactant.	 Approximately	 90%	 of	
patients	 with	 active	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 have	 a	 positive	
antiproteinase-3	 ANCA.	 However,	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 active	 disease,	
the	sensitivity	drops	to	~60–70%.	A	small	percentage	of	patients	with	
granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	may	have	antimyeloperoxidase	rather	
than	antiproteinase-3	antibodies,	and	up	to	20%	may	lack	ANCA.

Patients	with	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	have	been	found	to	
have	 an	 increased	 incidence	 of	 venous	 thrombotic	 events.	 Although	
routine	 anticoagulation	 for	 all	 patients	 is	 not	 recommended,	 a

heightened	awareness	for	any	clinical	features	suggestive	of	deep-vein	
thrombosis	or	pulmonary	emboli	is	warranted.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	 diagnosis	 of	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 can	 be	 established	
by	the	demonstration	of	necrotizing	granulomatous	vasculitis	on	tissue	
biopsy	in	a	patient	with	compatible	clinical	features.	Pulmonary	tissue	
offers	the	highest	diagnostic	yield,	almost	invariably	revealing	granulo-
matous	vasculitis.	Biopsy	of	upper	airway	tissue	usually	reveals	granulo-
matous	inflammation	with	necrosis	but	may	not	show	vasculitis.	Renal	
biopsy	can	confirm	the	presence	of	pauci-immune	glomerulonephritis.
The	specificity	of	a	positive	antiproteinase-3	ANCA	for	granuloma-
tosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 is	 very	 high,	 especially	 if	 active	 glomerulone-
phritis	is	present.	However,	the	presence	of	ANCA	should	be	viewed	as	
adjunctive	with	tissue	diagnosis	being	pursued	when	clinically	incon-
sistent	 features	 are	 present	 or	 when	 ANCA	 is	 absent.	 False-positive	
ANCA	has	been	reported	in	certain	infectious	and	neoplastic	diseases.
In	its	typical	presentation,	the	clinicopathologic	complex	of	granu-
lomatosis	with	polyangiitis	usually	provides	ready	differentiation	from	
other	disorders.	However,	if	all	the	typical	features	are	not	present	at	
once,	 it	 needs	 to	 be	 differentiated	 from	 the	 other	 vasculitides,	 anti-
glomerular	 basement	 membrane	 disease	 (Goodpasture’s	 syndrome)	
(Chap.  314),	 relapsing	 polychondritis	 (Chap.  366),	 tumors	 of	 the	
upper	 airway	 or	 lung,	 and	 infectious	 diseases	 such	 as	 histoplasmosis	
(Chap. 212),	endocarditis	(Chap. 128),	mucocutaneous	leishmaniasis	
(Chap. 226),	and	rhinoscleroma	(Chap. 218)	as	well	as	noninfectious	
granulomatous	diseases.

Of	particular	note	is	the	differentiation	from	other	midline destructive dis-
eases.	These	diseases	lead	to	extreme	tissue	destruction	and	mutilation	
localized	to	the	midline	upper	airway	structures	including	the	sinuses;	
erosion	through	the	skin	of	the	face	commonly	occurs,	a	feature	that	
is	extremely	rare	in	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis.	Although	blood	
vessels	 may	 be	 involved	 in	 the	 intense	 inflammatory	 reaction	 and	
necrosis,	 primary	 vasculitis	 is	 not	 seen.	 Upper  airway  neoplasms	 and	
specifically	extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type)	
are	important	causes	of	midline	destructive	disease.	These	lesions	are	
diagnosed	 based	 on	 histology,	 which	 reveals	 polymorphous	 atypical	
lymphoid	cells	with	an	NK	cell	immunophenotype,	typically	Epstein-
Barr	 virus	 (Chap.  194).	 Such	 cases	 are	 treated	 based	 on	 their	 degree	
of	dissemination,	and	localized	lesions	have	responded	to	irradiation.	
Upper	airway	lesions	should	never	be	irradiated	in	granulomatosis	with	
polyangiitis.	 Cocaine-induced	 tissue	 injury	 can	 be	 another	 important	
mimic	of	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	in	patients	who	present	with	
isolated	 midline	 destructive	 disease.	 ANCA	 that	 target	 human	 neu-
trophil	elastase	can	be	found	in	patients	with	cocaine-induced	midline	
destructive	lesions	and	can	complicate	the	differentiation	from	granulo-
matosis	with	polyangiitis.	This	has	been	further	confounded	by	the	high	
frequency	 of	 levamisole	 adulteration	 of	 cocaine,	 which	 can	 result	 in	
cutaneous	infarction	and	serologic	changes	that	may	mimic	vasculitis.	
Granulocytopenia	is	a	common	finding	in	levamisole-induced	disease	
that	would	not	be	associated	with	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis.

Granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 must	 also	 be	 differentiated	 from	
lymphomatoid granulomatosis,	which	is	an	Epstein-Barr	virus–positive	
B-cell	proliferation	that	is	associated	with	an	exuberant	T-cell	reaction.	
Lymphomatoid	 granulomatosis	 is	 characterized	 by	 lung,	 skin,	 CNS,	
and	kidney	involvement	in	which	atypical	lymphocytoid	and	plasma-
cytoid	cells	infiltrate	nonlymphoid	tissue	in	an	angioinvasive	manner.	
In	this	regard,	it	clearly	differs	from	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	
in	that	it	is	not	an	inflammatory	vasculitis	in	the	classic	sense	but	an	
angiocentric	perivascular	infiltration	of	atypical	mononuclear	cells.	Up	
to	50%	of	patients	may	develop	a	true	malignant	lymphoma.

TREATMENT
Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis

Prior	to	the	introduction	of	effective	therapy,	granulomatosis	with	
polyangiitis	was	universally	fatal	within	a	few	months	of	diagnosis.	
Glucocorticoids	alone	led	to	some	symptomatic	improvement,	with	
little	effect	on	the	ultimate	course	of	the	disease.	The	development

of	treatment	with	cyclophosphamide	dramatically	changed	patient	
outcome	 such	 that	 marked	 improvement	 was	 seen	 in	 >90%	 of	
patients,	complete	remission	in	75%	of	patients,	and	5-year	patient	
survival	was	seen	in	>80%.

Despite	 the	 ability	 to	 successfully	 induce	 remission,	 50–70%	
of	 remissions	 are	 later	 associated	 with	 one	 or	 more	 relapses.	 The	
determination	of	relapse	should	be	based	on	objective	evidence	of	
disease	activity,	taking	care	to	rule	out	other	features	that	may	have	a	
similar	appearance	such	as	infection,	medication	toxicity,	or	chronic	
disease	sequelae.	Many	patients	who	achieve	remission	continue	to	
have	a	positive	ANCA	for	years,	and	changes	in	ANCA	should	not	
be	used	as	a	measure	of	disease	activity.	Results	from	a	large	pro-
spective	 study	 found	 that	 increases	 in	 ANCA	 were	 not	 associated	
with	relapse	and	that	only	43%	of	patients	relapsed	within	1	year	of	
an	increase	in	ANCA	levels.	Thus,	a	rise	in	ANCA	by	itself	is	not	a	
harbinger	of	immediate	disease	relapse	and	should	not	lead	to	rein-
stitution	or	increase	in	immunosuppressive	therapy.	Reinduction	of	
remission	after	relapse	is	almost	always	achieved;	however,	a	high	
percentage	of	patients	ultimately	have	some	degree	of	damage	from	
irreversible	features	of	their	disease,	such	as	varying	degrees	of	renal	
insufficiency,	neurologic	impairment,	hearing	loss,	subglottic	steno-
sis,	saddle	nose	deformity,	and	chronic	sinus	dysfunction.	Patients	
who	 developed	 irreversible	 renal	 failure	 but	 who	 achieved	 subse-
quent	remission	have	undergone	successful	renal	transplantation.

Treatment	 of	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 is	 currently	
viewed	as	having	two	phases:	induction,	where	active	disease	is	put	
into	 remission,	 followed	 by	 maintenance.	 The	 decision	 regarding	
which	 agents	 to	 use	 for	 induction	 and	 maintenance	 is	 guided	 by	
experience	 from	 published	 data,	 determination	 of	 disease	 sever-
ity,	 and	 individual	 patient	 factors	 that	 include	 contraindications,	
relapse	history,	and	comorbidities.

Current	 induction	 regimens	 consist	 of	 glucocorticoids	 plus	
another	immunosuppressive	agent.	For	severe	disease,	glucocorti-
coids	have	historically	been	given	as	prednisone	1	mg/kg	per	day	for	
the	first	month,	followed	by	gradual	tapering	on	an	alternate-day	
or	 daily	 schedule.	 Recently,	 use	 of	 a	 reduced-dose	 glucocorticoid	
regimen	was	found	to	be	noninferior	to	a	standard-dose	regimen	in	
a	randomized	trial	and	was	associated	with	a	lower	rate	of	serious	
infection.	For	patients	with	nonsevere	disease,	use	of	lower	initial	
glucocorticoid	doses	can	be	considered.

In	patients	presenting	with	disease	that	is	life-threatening,	meth-
ylprednisolone	1000	mg	daily	for	3	days	has	been	used.	Adjunctive	
plasmapheresis	 was	 recently	 found	 to	 provide	 no	 added	 benefit	
in	 reducing	 the	 composite	 outcome	 of	 end-stage	 renal	 disease	 or	
death.	Whether	it	may	still	play	a	role	in	selected	patients	with	the	
most	fulminant	disease	remains	uncertain.	
CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE INDUCTION FOR SEVERE DISEASE
Daily	 cyclophosphamide	 combined	 with	 glucocorticoids	 was	 the	
first	 regimen	 proven	 to	 effectively	 induce	 remission	 and	 prolong	
survival.	Cyclophosphamide	is	given	in	doses	of	2	mg/kg	per	day	
orally,	but	because	it	is	renally	eliminated,	dosage	reduction	should	
be	 considered	 in	 patients	 with	 renal	 insufficiency.	 Although	 we	
continue	to	favor	the	use	of	daily	cyclophosphamide,	some	reports	
have	indicated	therapeutic	success	using	IV	cyclophosphamide.	In	
a	randomized	trial,	IV	cyclophosphamide	15	mg/kg,	three	infusions	
given	every	2	weeks,	then	every	3	weeks	thereafter,	was	compared	
to	cyclophosphamide	2	mg/kg	daily	given	for	3	months	followed	by	
1.5	mg/kg	daily.	Although	IV	cyclophosphamide	was	found	to	have	
a	comparable	rate	of	remission	with	a	lower	cumulative	cyclophos-
phamide	dose	and	occurrence	of	leukopenia,	the	use	of	a	consolida-
tion	phase	and	an	insufficient	frequency	of	blood	count	monitoring	
may	 have	 negatively	 influenced	 the	 results	 in	 those	 who	 received	
daily	 cyclophosphamide.	 Of	 note	 in	 this	 study	 was	 that	 relapse	
occurred	 in	 19%	 of	 those	 who	 received	 IV	 cyclophosphamide	 as	
compared	to	9%	who	received	daily	oral	administration.	
RITUXIMAB INDUCTION FOR SEVERE DISEASE
Rituximab	 is	 a	 chimeric	 monoclonal	 antibody	 directed	 against	
CD20	present	on	normal	and	malignant	B	lymphocytes	that	is	U.S.	

Food	and	Drug	Administration	(FDA)	approved	for	the	treatment	
of	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 and	 microscopic	 polyangiitis.	
In	 two	 randomized	 trials	 that	 enrolled	 ANCA-positive	 patients	
with	severe	active	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	or	microscopic	
polyangiitis,	 rituximab	 375	 mg/m2	 once	 a	 week	 for	 4	 weeks	 in	
combination	 with	 glucocorticoids	 was	 found	 to	 be	 as	 effective	
as	 cyclophosphamide	 with	 glucocorticoids	 for	 inducing	 disease	
remission.	In	the	trial	that	also	enrolled	patients	with	relapsing	dis-
ease,	rituximab	was	found	to	be	statistically	superior	to	cyclophos-
phamide.	Although	rituximab	does	not	have	the	bladder	toxicity	or	
infertility	concerns,	as	can	occur	with	cyclophosphamide,	in	both	of	
the	randomized	trials,	the	rate	of	adverse	events	was	similar	in	the	
rituximab	and	cyclophosphamide	arms.

The	decision	about	whether	to	utilize	cyclophosphamide	or	ritux-
imab	for	remission	induction	must	be	individually	based.	Factors	to	
consider	include	the	severity	of	the	disease,	whether	the	patient	has	
newly	diagnosed	or	relapsing	disease,	medication	contraindications,	
and	individual	patient	factors	particularly	including	fertility	concerns.	
In	patients	with	rapidly	progressive	glomerulonephritis	with	a	crea-
tinine	>4.0	mg/dL	or	pulmonary	hemorrhage	requiring	mechanical	
ventilation,	daily	cyclophosphamide	and	glucocorticoids	are	favored.	

REMISSION MAINTENANCE
When	cyclophosphamide	is	given	for	induction,	it	should	be	stopped	
after	 3–6	 months	 and	 switched	 to	 another	 agent	 for	 remission	
maintenance.	Medications	used	in	this	setting	with	which	there	has	
been	 published	 experience	 from	 randomized	 trials	 are	 rituximab,	
azathioprine,	methotrexate,	and	mycophenolate	mofetil.	A	lower	rate	
of	 relapse	 was	 seen	 with	 rituximab	 given	 at	 500	 mg	 for	 two	 doses	
followed	by	500	mg	every	6	months	when	compared	to	azathioprine	
2	mg/kg	per	day.	In	a	randomized	trial	comparing	methotrexate	to	
azathioprine	for	remission	maintenance,	similar	rates	of	toxicity	and	
relapse	were	seen.	Methotrexate	is	administered	orally	or	subcutane-
ously	at	a	starting	not	to	exceed	15	mg/week,	which	is	increased	by	
2.5	mg	every	2	weeks	up	to	a	dosage	of	20–25	mg/week.	In	patients	
who	are	unable	to	receive	methotrexate	or	azathioprine	or	who	have	
experienced	 relapse	 on	 such	 treatment,	 mycophenolate	 mofetil	
1000	mg	twice	a	day	may	also	sustain	remission,	but	it	is	associated	
with	a	higher	rate	of	relapse	compared	to	azathioprine.

For	 patients	 who	 receive	 rituximab	 for	 remission	 induction,	 a	
recent	randomized	trial	found	that	rituximab	1000	mg	given	every	
4	months	had	a	lower	rate	of	relapse	compared	to	azathioprine.

The	optimal	duration	of	maintenance	therapy	is	uncertain.	With	
regard	to	glucocorticoids,	it	has	been	unclear	whether	maintaining	
patients	on	prednisone	5	mg/d	has	greater	risks	or	benefits	compared	
to	discontinuation	after	6–9	months.	Maintenance	therapy	with	aza-
thioprine,	methotrexate,	or	mycophenolate	mofetil	is	usually	given	
for	a	minimum	of	2	years.	Because	there	is	evidence	that	the	risk	of	
relapse	is	higher	once	maintenance	medication	has	been	stopped,	the	
decision	is	individualized	regarding	whether	to	continue	treatment	
or	taper	these	agents	over	a	6-	to	12-month	period	until	discontinu-
ation.	Patients	with	significant	organ	damage	or	a	history	of	relapse	
may	benefit	from	longer-term	maintenance	therapy.	Although	ritux-
imab	has	been	found	to	have	a	lower	relapse	rate,	its	long-term	safety	
remains	uncertain	such	that	the	decision	for	how	long	to	continue	
this	agent	beyond	2	years	must	be	weighed	in	each	patient.	
REMISSION INDUCTION OF NONSEVERE DISEASE
For	 patients	 whose	 disease	 is	 not	 immediately	 organ-	 or	 life-	
threatening,	methotrexate	or	mycophenolate	mofetil	together	with	
glucocorticoids	may	be	given	to	induce	and	then	maintain	remis-
sion.	Treatment	with	cyclophosphamide	is	rarely	if	ever	justified	for	
the	treatment	of	nonsevere	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis.	
OTHER BIOLOGIC AGENTS AND SMALL MOLECULE 
INHIBITORS
Abatacept	(CTLA4-Ig)	was	examined	in	an	open-label	pilot	study	
of	 nonsevere	 relapsing	 disease	 with	 favorable	 results,	 but	 fur-
ther	investigation	is	needed	before	application	to	clinical	practice.

when	used	adjunctively	to	standard	therapy	and	should	not	be	used	
in	 the	 treatment	 of	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis.	 Belimumab	
(anti-B	 lymphocyte	 stimulator)	 was	 examined	 as	 an	 adjunctive	
therapy	to	azathioprine	for	remission	maintenance	but	showed	no	
added	benefit	in	reducing	the	risk	of	relapse.

Avacopan	(a	C5a	receptor	inhibitor)	was	recently	investigated	in	
a	randomized	trial	as	an	alternative	to	glucocorticoids	in	patients	
receiving	 induction	 with	 either	 cyclophosphamide	 or	 rituximab.	
At	52	weeks,	sustained	remission	was	higher	in	those	who	received	
avacopan	as	compared	to	prednisone	with	a	similar	rate	of	serious	
adverse	 events.	 Although	 glucocorticoids	 were	 given	 within	 the	
first	few	weeks	to	some	patients	receiving	avacopan,	glucocorticoid	
exposure	 remained	 markedly	 less	 than	 those	 randomized	 to	 the	
prednisone	treatment	arm.	Based	on	these	findings,	avacopan	holds	
promise	in	being	able	to	reduce	the	need	for	glucocorticoids	in	the	
treatment	of	ANCA-associated	vasculitis.	
TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE
Although	certain	reports	have	indicated	that	TMP-SMX	may	be	of	
benefit	in	the	treatment	of	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	isolated	
to	the	sinonasal	tissues,	it	should	never	be	used	alone	to	treat	active	
granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	involving	other	organs.	In	a	study	
examining	 the	 effect	 of	 TMP-SMX	 on	 relapse,	 decreased	 relapses	
were	shown	only	with	regard	to	upper	airway	disease,	and	no	dif-
ferences	in	major	organ	relapses	were	observed.	
ORGAN-SPECIFIC TREATMENT
Not	all	manifestations	of	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	require	
or	 respond	 to	 immunosuppressive	 therapy,	 and	 differentiation	 of	
active	disease	from	damage	is	necessary.	As	sinus	disease	can	dis-
rupt	the	mucociliary	barrier,	patients	should	be	instructed	on	the	
use	of	local	care	with	moisturization	and	humidification.	Subglottic	
stenosis	can	often	scar	and	responds	optimally	to	nonmedical	inter-
vention	with	dilation	and	glucocorticoid	injection.

weight	loss,	and	musculoskeletal	pain;	however,	it	is	often	acute.	Glo-
merulonephritis	occurs	in	at	least	79%	of	patients	and	can	be	rapidly

tom	of	alveolar	hemorrhage,	which	occurs	in	12%	of	patients.	Other	
manifestations	 include	 mononeuritis	 multiplex	 and	 gastrointestinal	
tract	 and	 cutaneous	 vasculitis.	 Upper	 airway	 disease	 and	 pulmonary	
nodules	 are	 not	 typically	 found	 in	 microscopic	 polyangiitis	 and,	 if	
present,	suggest	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis.

Features	 of	 inflammation	 may	 be	 seen,	 including	 an	 elevated	 ESR	
and/or	 CRP,	 anemia,	 leukocytosis,	 and	 thrombocytosis.	 ANCA	 are	
present	in	75%	of	patients	with	microscopic	polyangiitis,	with	antimy-
eloperoxidase	antibodies	being	the	predominant	antigen	association.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	 diagnosis	 is	 based	 on	 histologic	 evidence	 of	 vasculitis	 or	 pauci-	
immune	 glomerulonephritis	 in	 a	 patient	 with	 compatible	 clinical	
features	of	multisystem	disease.	Although	microscopic	polyangiitis	is	
strongly	 ANCA-associated,	 tissue	 biopsy	 should	 continue	 to	 be	 pur-
sued	in	patients	who	do	not	have	a	clinically	compatible	picture.

TREATMENT
Microscopic Polyangiitis

The	 5-year	 survival	 rate	 for	 patients	 with	 treated	 microscopic	
polyangiitis	is	74%,	with	disease-related	mortality	occurring	from	
alveolar	 hemorrhage	 or	 gastrointestinal,	 cardiac,	 or	 renal	 disease.	
Studies	 on	 treatment	 have	 come	 from	 trials	 that	 have	 included	
patients	 with	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 or	 microscopic	
polyangiitis.	 Currently,	 the	 treatment	 approach	 for	 microscopic	
polyangiitis	is	the	same	as	is	used	for	granulomatosis	with	polyangi-
itis	(see	“Granulomatosis	with	Polyangiitis”	for	a	detailed	descrip-
tion	of	this	therapeutic	regimen).	Disease	relapse	has	been	observed	
in	 at	 least	 34%	 of	 patients.	 Treatment	 for	 such	 relapses	 would	 be	
based	on	site	and	severity	of	disease.

MICROSCOPIC POLYANGIITIS
 ■ DEFINITION
The	term	microscopic polyarteritis	was	introduced	into	the	literature	by	
Davson	in	1948	in	recognition	of	the	presence	of	glomerulonephritis	in	
patients	with	polyarteritis	nodosa.	In	1992,	the	Chapel	Hill	Consensus	
Conference	 on	 the	 Nomenclature	 of	 Systemic	 Vasculitis	 adopted	 the	
term	 microscopic  polyangiitis	 to	 connote	 a	 necrotizing	 vasculitis	 with	
few	or	no	immune	complexes	affecting	small	vessels	(capillaries,	ven-
ules,	or	arterioles).	Glomerulonephritis	is	very	common	in	microscopic	
polyangiitis,	 and	 pulmonary	 capillaritis	 often	 occurs.	 The	 absence	 of	
granulomatous	 inflammation	 in	 microscopic	 polyangiitis	 is	 said	 to	
differentiate	it	from	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis.
 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
The	 incidence	 of	 microscopic	 polyangiitis	 is	 estimated	 to	 be	
3–5/100,000.	The	mean	age	of	onset	is	~57	years,	and	males	are	slightly	
more	frequently	affected	than	females.
 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Microscopic	 polyangiitis	 has	 a	 predilection	 to	 involve	 capillaries	 and	
venules	 in	 addition	 to	 small-	 and	 medium-sized	 arteries.	 Immunohis-
tochemical	 staining	 reveals	 a	 paucity	 of	 immunoglobulin	 deposition	
in	 the	 vascular	 lesion	 of	 microscopic	 polyangiitis,	 suggesting	 that	
immune-complex	formation	does	not	play	a	role	in	the	pathogenesis	of	
this	syndrome.	The	renal	lesion	seen	in	microscopic	polyangiitis	is	identi-
cal	to	that	of	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis.	Like	granulomatosis	with	
polyangiitis,	 microscopic	 polyangiitis	 is	 highly	 associated	 with	 ANCA,	
which	may	play	a	role	in	pathogenesis	of	this	syndrome	(see	above).
 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS
Because	 of	 its	 predilection	 to	 involve	 the	 small	 vessels,	 microscopic	
polyangiitis	and	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	share	similar	clinical	
features.	Disease	onset	may	be	gradual,	with	initial	symptoms	of	fever,	

EOSINOPHILIC GRANULOMATOSIS WITH 
POLYANGIITIS (CHURG-STRAUSS)
 ■ DEFINITION
Eosinophilic	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 (Churg-Strauss)	 was	
described	in	1951	by	Churg	and	Strauss	and	is	characterized	by	asthma,	
peripheral	and	tissue	eosinophilia,	extravascular	granuloma	formation,	
and	vasculitis	of	multiple	organ	systems.
 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
Eosinophilic	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 (Churg-Strauss)	 is	 an	
uncommon	 disease	 with	 an	 estimated	 annual	 incidence	 of	 1–3	 per	
million.	The	disease	can	occur	at	any	age	with	the	possible	exception	
of	 infants.	 The	 mean	 age	 of	 onset	 is	 48	 years,	 with	 a	 female-to-male	
ratio	of	1.2:1.
 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The	 necrotizing	 vasculitis	 of	 eosinophilic	 granulomatosis	 with	
polyangiitis	 (Churg-Strauss)	 involves	 small-	 and	 medium-sized	 mus-
cular	 arteries,	 capillaries,	 veins,	 and	 venules.	 A	 characteristic	 histo-
pathologic	 feature	 of	 eosinophilic	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	
(Churg-Strauss)	is	granuloma	that	may	be	present	in	the	tissues	or	even	
within	the	walls	of	the	vessels	themselves.	These	are	usually	associated	
with	infiltration	of	the	tissues	with	eosinophils.	This	process	can	occur	
in	any	organ	in	the	body;	lung	involvement	is	predominant,	with	skin,	
cardiovascular	system,	kidney,	peripheral	nervous	system,	and	gastro-
intestinal	tract	also	commonly	involved.	Although	the	precise	patho-
genesis	of	this	disease	is	uncertain,	its	strong	association	with	asthma	
and	its	clinicopathologic	manifestations,	including	eosinophilia,	gran-
uloma,	and	vasculitis,	point	to	aberrant	immunologic	phenomena.
 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS
Patients	 with	 eosinophilic	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 (Churg-
Strauss)	often	exhibit	nonspecific	manifestations	such	as	fever,	malaise,

2810 anorexia,	 and	 weight	 loss,	 which	 are	 characteristic	 of	 a	 multisystem	
disease.	The	pulmonary	findings	in	eosinophilic	granulomatosis	with	
polyangiitis	(Churg-Strauss)	dominate	the	clinical	picture	with	severe	
asthmatic	attacks	and	the	presence	of	pulmonary	infiltrates.	Mononeu-
ritis	multiplex	is	the	second	most	common	manifestation	and	occurs	
in	up	to	72%	of	patients.	Allergic	rhinitis	and	sinusitis	develop	in	up	to	
61%	of	patients	and	are	often	observed	early	in	the	course	of	disease.	
Clinically	 recognizable	 heart	 disease	 with	 myocarditis,	 pericarditis,	
endocarditis,	or	coronary	vasculitis	occurs	in	~14%	of	patients	and	is	
an	important	cause	of	mortality.	Skin	lesions	occur	in	~51%	of	patients	
and	include	purpura	in	addition	to	cutaneous	and	subcutaneous	nod-
ules.	The	renal	disease	in	eosinophilic	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	
(Churg-Strauss)	is	less	common	and	generally	less	severe	than	that	of	
granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	and	microscopic	polyangiitis.

The	characteristic	laboratory	finding	in	virtually	all	patients	with	eos-
inophilic	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 (Churg-Strauss)	 is	 a	 striking	
eosinophilia,	 which	 reaches	 levels	 >1000	 cells/μL	 in	 >80%	 of	 patients.	
Evidence	 of	 inflammation	 as	 evidenced	 by	 elevated	 ESR	 and/or	 CRP,	
fibrinogen,	or	α2-globulins	can	be	found	in	81%	of	patients.	The	other	lab-
oratory	findings	reflect	the	organ	systems	involved.	Approximately	48%	
of	 patients	 with	 eosinophilic	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 (Churg-
Strauss)	have	circulating	ANCA	that	is	usually	antimyeloperoxidase.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Although	the	diagnosis	of	eosinophilic	granulomatosis	with	polyangi-
itis	(Churg-Strauss)	is	optimally	made	by	biopsy	in	a	patient	with	the	
characteristic	clinical	manifestations	(see	above),	histologic	confirma-
tion	can	be	challenging	because	the	pathognomonic	features	often	do	
not	occur	simultaneously.	In	order	to	be	diagnosed	with	eosinophilic	
granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 (Churg-Strauss),	 a	 patient	 should	
have	 evidence	 of	 asthma,	 peripheral	 blood	 eosinophilia,	 and	 clinical	
features	consistent	with	vasculitis.

TREATMENT
Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis 
(Churg-Strauss)

The	 prognosis	 of	 untreated	 eosinophilic	 granulomatosis	 with	
polyangiitis	(Churg-Strauss)	is	poor,	with	a	reported	5-year	survival	
of	25%.	With	treatment,	prognosis	is	favorable,	with	one	study	find-
ing	a	78-month	actuarial	survival	rate	of	72%.	Myocardial	involve-
ment	is	the	most	frequent	cause	of	death	and	is	responsible	for	39%	
of	patient	mortality.	Echocardiography	should	be	performed	in	all	
newly	 diagnosed	 patients	 because	 this	 may	 influence	 therapeutic	
decisions.

Glucocorticoids	 alone	 appear	 to	 be	 effective	 in	 many	 patients.	
Dosage	 tapering	 is	 often	 limited	 by	 asthma,	 and	 many	 patients	
require	 low-dose	 prednisone	 for	 persistent	 asthma	 many	 years	
after	clinical	recovery	from	vasculitis.	In	patients	who	present	with	
fulminant	 multisystem	 disease,	 particularly	 cardiac	 involvement,	
the	treatment	of	choice	is	a	combined	regimen	of	daily	cyclophos-
phamide	and	prednisone	followed	by	azathioprine	or	methotrexate	
(see	“Granulomatosis	with	Polyangiitis”	for	a	detailed	description	of	
this	therapeutic	regimen).

Mepolizumab	 (anti-IL-5	 antibody)	 300	 mg	 given	 subcutane-
ously	once	a	month	was	studied	in	a	randomized	trial	and	found	
to	 be	 more	 effective	 than	 placebo.	 Patients	 with	 life-threatening	
eosinophilic	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis	(Churg-Strauss)	were	
excluded	 from	 the	 mepolizumab	 trial	 and	 should	 continue	 to	 be	
treated	 with	 cyclophosphamide	 and	 glucocorticoids.	 As	 mepoli-
zumab	is	FDA	approved	for	both	eosinophilic	granulomatosis	with	
polyangiitis	(Churg-Straus)	and	severe	eosinophilic	asthma,	it	may	
have	a	particularly	beneficial	role	in	the	setting	of	relapsing	or	resis-
tant	asthma	requiring	glucocorticoids.

Rituximab	 has	 been	 examined	 in	 retrospective	 series	 and	 may	
have	 a	 role	 in	 patients	 with	 active	 or	 relapsing	 vasculitis	 despite	
conventional	agents	or	intolerance	of	these	medications.

POLYARTERITIS NODOSA
 ■ DEFINITION
Polyarteritis	 nodosa	 was	 described	 in	 1866	 by	 Kussmaul	 and	 Maier.	
It	is	a	multisystem,	necrotizing	vasculitis	of	small-	and	medium-sized	
muscular	arteries	in	which	involvement	of	the	renal	and	visceral	arter-
ies	is	characteristic.	Polyarteritis	nodosa	does	not	involve	pulmonary	
arteries,	although	bronchial	vessels	may	be	involved;	granulomas,	sig-
nificant	eosinophilia,	and	an	allergic	diathesis	are	not	observed.

 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
It	is	difficult	to	establish	an	accurate	incidence	of	polyarteritis	nodosa	
because	 previous	 reports	 have	 included	 polyarteritis	 nodosa	 and	
microscopic	 polyangiitis	 as	 well	 as	 other	 related	 vasculitides.	 Polyar-
teritis	 nodosa,	 as	 currently	 defined,	 is	 felt	 to	 be	 a	 very	 uncommon	
disease.

 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The	vascular	lesion	in	polyarteritis	nodosa	is	a	necrotizing	inflamma-
tion	 of	 small-	 and	 medium-sized	 muscular	 arteries.	 The	 lesions	 are	
segmental	and	tend	to	involve	bifurcations	and	branchings	of	arteries.	
They	may	spread	circumferentially	to	involve	adjacent	veins.	However,	
involvement	of	venules	is	not	seen	in	polyarteritis	nodosa	and,	if	pres-
ent,	suggests	microscopic	polyangiitis	(see	below).	In	the	acute	stages	
of	 disease,	 polymorphonuclear	 neutrophils	 infiltrate	 all	 layers	 of	 the	
vessel	 wall	 and	 perivascular	 areas,	 which	 results	 in	 intimal	 prolifera-
tion	 and	 degeneration	 of	 the	 vessel	 wall.	 Mononuclear	 cells	 infiltrate	
the	 area	 as	 the	 lesions	 progress	 to	 the	 subacute	 and	 chronic	 stages.	
Fibrinoid	necrosis	of	the	vessels	ensues	with	compromise	of	the	lumen,	
thrombosis,	 infarction	 of	 the	 tissues	 supplied	 by	 the	 involved	 vessel,	
and,	in	some	cases,	hemorrhage.	As	the	lesions	heal,	there	is	collagen	
deposition,	which	may	lead	to	further	occlusion	of	the	vessel	lumen.	
Aneurysmal	dilations	up	to	1	cm	in	size	along	the	involved	arteries	are	
characteristic	of	polyarteritis	nodosa.

Multiple	 organ	 systems	 are	 involved,	 and	 the	 clinicopathologic	
findings	reflect	the	degree	and	location	of	vessel	involvement	and	the	
resulting	 ischemic	 changes.	 As	 mentioned	 above,	 pulmonary	 arteries	
are	not	involved	in	polyarteritis	nodosa,	and	bronchial	artery	involve-
ment	 is	 uncommon.	 The	 pathology	 in	 the	 kidney	 in	 polyarteritis	
nodosa	is	that	of	arteritis	without	glomerulonephritis.	In	patients	with	
significant	hypertension,	typical	pathologic	features	of	glomeruloscle-
rosis	 may	 be	 seen.	 In	 addition,	 pathologic	 sequelae	 of	 hypertension	
may	be	found	elsewhere	in	the	body.

The	 presence	 of	 a	 polyarteritis	 nodosa–like	 vasculitis	 in	 patients	
with	 hepatitis	 B	 together	 with	 the	 isolation	 of	 circulating	 immune	
complexes	composed	of	hepatitis	B	antigen	and	immunoglobulin	and	
the	demonstration	by	immunofluorescence	of	hepatitis	B	antigen,	IgM,	
and	complement	in	the	blood	vessel	walls	strongly	suggest	the	role	of	
immunologic	 phenomena	 in	 the	 pathogenesis	 of	 this	 disease.	 A	 pol-
yarteritis	nodosa–like	vasculitis	has	also	been	reported	in	patients	with	
hepatitis	 C.	 Hairy	 cell	 leukemia	 can	 be	 associated	 with	 polyarteritis	
nodosa;	the	pathogenic	mechanisms	of	this	association	are	unclear.

A	 polyarteritis	 nodosa–like	 vasculitis	 has	 being	 described	 in	 con-
junction	 with	 deficiency	 of	 adenosine	 deaminase	 type	 2	 (DADA2).	
Patients	 with	 DADA2	 usually	 present	 in	 childhood	 with	 a	 variable	
pattern	of	clinical	features	and	vascular	pathology	that	is	responsive	to	
TNF	inhibitors.	As	this	differs	from	the	usual	treatment	for	polyarteri-
tis	nodosa,	DADA2	should	be	considered	in	patients	with	suggestive	
clinical	features,	particularly	those	with	early-onset	disease.

 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS
Nonspecific	 signs	 and	 symptoms	 are	 the	 hallmarks	 of	 polyarteritis	
nodosa.	Fever,	weight	loss,	and	malaise	are	present	in	over	one-half	of	
cases.	Patients	usually	present	with	vague	symptoms	such	as	weakness,	
malaise,	 headache,	 abdominal	 pain,	 and	 myalgias	 that	 can	 rapidly	
progress	to	a	fulminant	illness.	Specific	complaints	related	to	the	vas-
cular	involvement	within	a	particular	organ	system	may	also	dominate	
the	presenting	clinical	picture	as	well	as	the	entire	course	of	the	illness

(Table 363-6).	 In	 polyarteritis	 nodosa,	 renal	 involvement	 most	 com-
monly	 manifests	 as	 hypertension,	 renal	 insufficiency,	 or	 hemorrhage	
due	to	microaneurysms.

There	are	no	diagnostic	serologic	tests	for	polyarteritis	nodosa.	In	
>75%	of	patients,	the	leukocyte	count	is	elevated	with	a	predominance	
of	 neutrophils.	 Eosinophilia	 is	 seen	 only	 rarely	 and,	 when	 present	 at	
high	levels,	suggests	the	diagnosis	of	eosinophilic	granulomatosis	with	
polyangiitis	 (Churg-Strauss).	 The	 anemia	 of	 chronic	 disease	 may	 be	
seen,	and	an	elevated	ESR	and/or	CRP	is	almost	always	present.	Other	
common	 laboratory	 findings	 reflect	 the	 particular	 organ	 involved.	
Hypergammaglobulinemia	may	be	present,	and	all	patients	should	be	
screened	for	hepatitis	B	and	C.	ANCA	are	rarely	found	in	patients	with	
polyarteritis	nodosa.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	 diagnosis	 of	 polyarteritis	 nodosa	 is	 based	 on	 the	 demonstration	
of	 characteristic	 findings	 of	 vasculitis	 on	 biopsy	 material	 of	 involved	
organs.	 Biopsy	 of	 symptomatic	 organs	 such	 as	 nodular	 skin	 lesions,	
painful	testes,	and	nerve/muscle	provides	the	highest	diagnostic	yields.	
In	the	absence	of	easily	accessible	tissue	for	biopsy,	the	arteriographic	
demonstration	 of	 involved	 vessels,	 particularly	 in	 the	 form	 of	 aneu-
rysms	of	small-	and	medium-sized	arteries	in	the	renal,	hepatic,	and	
visceral	 vasculature,	 is	 sufficient	 to	 make	 the	 diagnosis.	 This	 should	
consist	of	a	catheter-directed	dye	arteriogram	because	magnetic	reso-
nance	and	computed	tomography	arteriograms	do	not	have	sufficient	
resolution	at	the	current	time	to	visualize	the	vessels	affected	in	pol-
yarteritis	nodosa.	Aneurysms	of	vessels	are	not	pathognomonic	of	pol-
yarteritis	nodosa;	furthermore,	aneurysms	need	not	always	be	present,	
and	arteriographic	findings	may	be	limited	to	stenotic	segments	and	
obliteration	of	vessels.

TREATMENT
Polyarteritis Nodosa

The	prognosis	of	untreated	polyarteritis	nodosa	is	extremely	poor,	
with	 a	 reported	 5-year	 survival	 rate	 between	 10	 and	 20%.	 Death	
usually	 results	 from	 gastrointestinal	 complications,	 particularly	
bowel	 infarcts	 and	 perforation,	 and	 cardiovascular	 causes.	 Intrac-
table	 hypertension	 often	 compounds	 dysfunction	 in	 other	 organ	
systems,	such	as	the	kidneys,	heart,	and	CNS,	leading	to	additional	
late	 morbidity	 and	 mortality	 in	 polyarteritis	 nodosa.	 The	 combi-
nation	 of	 prednisone	 and	 cyclophosphamide	 has	 been	 found	 to	
significantly	 improve	 the	 survival	 rate	 (see	 “Granulomatosis	 with	
Polyangiitis”	for	a	detailed	description	of	this	therapeutic	regimen).	
In	 less	 severe	 cases	 of	 polyarteritis	 nodosa,	 glucocorticoids	 alone	

have	resulted	in	disease	remission.	In	patients	with	hepatitis	B	or	
C	who	have	a	polyarteritis	nodosa–like	vasculitis,	antiviral	therapy	
represents	an	important	part	of	management	and	has	been	used	in	
combination	 with	 glucocorticoids	 and	 plasma	 exchange	 in	 some	
series.	Careful	attention	to	the	treatment	of	hypertension	can	lessen	
the	vascular	complications	of	polyarteritis	nodosa.	Following	suc-
cessful	treatment,	relapse	of	polyarteritis	nodosa	has	been	estimated	
to	occur	in	10–20%	of	patients.

GIANT CELL ARTERITIS AND 
POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA
 ■ DEFINITION
Giant  cell  arteritis,	 historically	 referred	 to	 as	 temporal  arteritis,	 is	 an	
inflammation	of	medium-	and	large-sized	arteries.	It	characteristically	
involves	 one	 or	 more	 branches	 of	 the	 carotid	 artery,	 particularly	 the	
temporal	 artery.	 However,	 it	 is	 a	 systemic	 disease	 that	 can	 involve	
arteries	 in	 multiple	 locations,	 particularly	 the	 aorta	 and	 its	 main	
branches.

Giant	cell	arteritis	is	closely	associated	with	polymyalgia rheumatica,	
which	 is	 characterized	 by	 stiffness,	 aching,	 and	 pain	 in	 the	 muscles	
of	the	neck,	shoulders,	lower	back,	hips,	and	thighs.	Most	commonly,	
polymyalgia	 rheumatica	 occurs	 in	 isolation,	 but	 it	 may	 be	 seen	 in	
40–50%	 of	 patients	 with	 giant	 cell	 arteritis.	 In	 addition,	 ~10–20%	 of	
patients	 who	 initially	 present	 with	 features	 of	 isolated	 polymyalgia	
rheumatica	 later	 go	 on	 to	 develop	 giant	 cell	 arteritis.	 This	 strong	
clinical	 association	 together	 with	 data	 from	 pathophysiologic	 studies	
has	 increasingly	 supported	 that	 giant	 cell	 arteritis	 and	 polymyalgia	
rheumatica	 represent	 differing	 clinical	 spectrums	 of	 a	 single	 disease	
process.

 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
Giant	 cell	 arteritis	 occurs	 almost	 exclusively	 in	 individuals	 aged	
>50	 years.	It	is	more	common	in	women	than	in	men	and	is	rare	in	
blacks.	 The	 incidence	 of	 giant	 cell	 arteritis	 varies	 widely	 in	 different	
studies	and	in	different	geographic	regions.	A	high	incidence	has	been	
found	 in	 Scandinavia	 and	 in	 regions	 of	 the	 United	 States	 with	 large	
Scandinavian	populations,	compared	to	a	lower	incidence	in	southern	
Europe.	The	annual	incidence	rates	in	individuals	aged	≥50	years	range	
from	6.9	to	32.8	per	100,000	population.	Familial	aggregation	has	been	
reported,	 as	 has	 an	 association	 with	 HLA-DR4.	 In	 addition,	 genetic	
linkage	studies	have	demonstrated	an	association	of	giant	cell	arteritis	
with	alleles	at	the	HLA-DRB1	locus,	particularly	HLA-DRB1*04	vari-
ants.	In	Olmsted	County,	Minnesota,	the	annual	incidence	of	polymy-
algia	 rheumatica	 in	 individuals	 aged	 ≥50	 years	 is	 58.7	 per	 100,000	
population.

 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Although	the	temporal	artery	is	most	frequently	involved	in	giant	cell	
arteritis,	patients	often	have	a	systemic	vasculitis	of	multiple	medium-	
and	large-sized	arteries,	which	may	go	undetected.	Histopathologically,	
the	disease	is	a	panarteritis	with	inflammatory	mononuclear	cell	infil-
trates	within	the	vessel	wall	with	frequent	giant	cell	formation.	There	
is	proliferation	of	the	intima	and	fragmentation	of	the	internal	elastic	
lamina.	Pathophysiologic	findings	in	organs	result	from	the	ischemia	
related	to	the	involved	vessels.

Experimental	 data	 support	 that	 giant	 cell	 arteritis	 is	 an	 antigen-
driven	 disease	 in	 which	 activated	 T	 lymphocytes,	 macrophages,	 and	
dendritic	cells	play	a	critical	role	in	pathogenesis.	Sequence	analysis	of	
the	T-cell	receptor	of	tissue-infiltrating	T	cells	in	lesions	of	giant	cell	
arteritis	indicates	restricted	clonal	expansion,	suggesting	the	presence	
of	an	antigen	residing	in	the	arterial	wall.	Giant	cell	arteritis	is	believed

should	be	considered.	Levels	of	enzymes	indicative	of	muscle	damage	
such	as	serum	creatine	kinase	are	not	elevated.

 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS
Giant	 cell	 arteritis	 is	 most	 commonly	 characterized	 clinically	 by	 the	
complex	 of	 fever,	 anemia,	 high	 ESR	 and/or	 CRP,	 and	 headaches	 in	 a	
patient	aged	>50	years.	Other	phenotypic	manifestations	include	fea-
tures	 of	 systemic	 inflammation,	 including	 malaise,	 fatigue,	 anorexia,	
weight	loss,	sweats,	arthralgias,	polymyalgia	rheumatica,	or	large-vessel	
disease.

In	patients	with	involvement	of	the	cranial	arteries,	headache	is	the	
predominant	 symptom	 and	 may	 be	 associated	 with	 a	 tender,	 thick-
ened,	 or	 nodular	 artery,	 which	 may	 pulsate	 early	 in	 the	 disease	 but	
may	become	occluded	later.	Scalp	pain	and	claudication	of	the	jaw	and	
tongue	 may	 occur.	 A	 well-recognized	 and	 dreaded	 complication	 of	
giant	cell	arteritis,	particularly	in	untreated	patients,	is	ischemic	optic	
neuropathy,	 which	 may	 lead	 to	 serious	 visual	 symptoms,	 including	
sudden	blindness	in	some	patients.	However,	most	patients	have	com-
plaints	relating	to	the	head	or	eyes	before	visual	loss.	Attention	to	such	
symptoms	with	institution	of	appropriate	therapy	(see	below)	lessens	
the	 risk	 of	 this	 complication.	 Other	 cranial	 ischemic	 complications	
include	strokes	and	scalp	or	tongue	infarction.

Up	 to	 one-third	 of	 patients	 can	 have	 large-vessel	 disease	 that	 can	
be	 the	 primary	 presentation	 of	 giant	 cell	 arteritis	 or	 can	 emerge	 at	 a	
later	point	in	patients	who	have	had	previous	cranial	arteritis	features	
or	polymyalgia	rheumatica.	Manifestations	of	large-vessel	disease	can	
include	subclavian	artery	stenosis	that	can	present	as	arm	claudication	
or	aortic	aneurysms	involving	the	thoracic	and	to	a	lesser	degree	the	
abdominal	aorta,	which	carry	risks	of	rupture	or	dissection.

Characteristic	 laboratory	 findings	 in	 addition	 to	 the	 elevated	 ESR	
and/or	CRP	include	a	normochromic	or	slightly	hypochromic	anemia.	
Liver	function	abnormalities	are	common,	particularly	increased	alka-
line	phosphatase	levels.	Increased	levels	of	IgG	and	complement	have	
been	reported.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	 diagnosis	 of	 giant	 cell	 arteritis	 can	 often	 be	 suggested	 clinically	
by	the	demonstration	of	the	complex	of	fever,	anemia,	and	high	ESR	
and/or	CRP	with	or	without	symptoms	of	polymyalgia	rheumatica	in	a	
patient	>50	years	old.	The	diagnosis	can	be	confirmed	by	biopsy	of	the	
temporal	artery	but	may	not	be	positive	in	all	patients	due	to	patchy	
histologic	findings.	Since	involvement	of	the	vessel	may	be	segmental,	
positive	 yield	 is	 increased	 by	 obtaining	 a	 biopsy	 segment	 of	 3–5	 cm	
together	with	serial	sectioning	of	biopsy	specimens.	Ultrasonography	
of	the	temporal	artery	has	been	reported	to	be	helpful	in	diagnosis	and	
has	been	increasingly	used	by	some	physicians.	Therapy	should	not	be	
delayed	pending	the	performance	of	diagnostic	studies.	In	this	regard,	
it	has	been	reported	that	temporal	artery	biopsies	may	show	vasculitis	
even	 after	 ~14	 days	 of	 glucocorticoid	 therapy.	 A	 dramatic	 clinical	
response	 to	 a	 trial	 of	 glucocorticoid	 therapy	 can	 further	 support	 the	
diagnosis.

Large-vessel	 disease	 may	 be	 suggested	 by	 symptoms	 and	 findings	
on	 physical	 examination	 such	 as	 diminished	 pulses	 or	 bruits.	 It	 is	
confirmed	 by	 vascular	 imaging,	 most	 commonly	 through	 magnetic	
resonance	 or	 computed	 tomography.	 Positron	 emission	 tomography	
has	become	increasingly	investigated,	although	its	role	in	diagnosis	and	
monitoring	remains	unclear.

Isolated	 polymyalgia	 rheumatica	 is	 a	 clinical	 diagnosis	 made	 by	
the	presence	of	typical	symptoms	of	stiffness,	aching,	and	pain	in	the	
muscles	of	the	hip	and	shoulder	girdle,	an	increased	ESR	and/or	CRP,	
the	 absence	 of	 clinical	 features	 suggestive	 of	 giant	 cell	 arteritis,	 and	
a	 prompt	 therapeutic	 response	 to	 low-dose	 prednisone.	 Polymyalgia	
rheumatica	can	be	associated	with	a	peripheral	arthritis	that	can	mimic	
rheumatoid	 arthritis	 (Chap.  358).	 Rheumatoid	 factor	 and	 anti-cyclic	
citrullinated	 peptide	 (CCP)	 shoulder	 be	 negative.	 In	 patients	 who	
develop	a	worsening	pattern	of	peripheral	arthritis,	the	potential	for	a	
seronegative	rheumatoid	arthritis	or	other	inflammatory	arthropathy	

TREATMENT
Giant Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica

Acute	disease–related	mortality	directly	from	giant	cell	arteritis	is	
uncommon,	 with	 fatalities	 occurring	 from	 cerebrovascular	 events	
or	myocardial	infarction.	However,	patients	are	at	risk	of	late	mor-
tality	from	aortic	aneurysm	rupture	or	dissection	as	patients	with	
giant	cell	arteritis	are	18	times	more	likely	to	develop	thoracic	aortic	
aneurysms	than	the	general	population.

The	goals	of	treatment	in	giant	cell	arteritis	are	to	reduce	symp-
toms	and,	most	importantly,	to	prevent	visual	loss.	The	treatment	
approach	for	cranial	and	large-vessel	disease	in	giant	cell	arteritis	is	
currently	the	same.	Giant	cell	arteritis	and	its	associated	symptoms	
are	 responsive	 to	 glucocorticoid	 therapy.	 Treatment	 should	 begin	
with	prednisone	40–60	mg/d	for	~1	month,	followed	by	a	gradual	
tapering.	 When	 ocular	 signs	 and	 symptoms	 occur,	 consideration	
should	be	given	for	the	use	of	methylprednisolone	1000	mg	daily	for	
3	days	to	protect	remaining	vision.	Although	the	optimal	duration	
of	glucocorticoid	therapy	has	not	been	established,	most	series	have	
found	that	patients	require	treatment	for	≥2	years.	Symptom	recur-
rence	during	prednisone	tapering	develops	in	60–85%	of	patients	
with	giant	cell	arteritis,	requiring	a	dosage	increase.	The	ESR	and/or	
CRP	can	serve	as	a	useful	indicator	of	inflammatory	disease	activity	
in	monitoring	and	tapering	therapy	and	can	be	used	to	judge	the	
pace	of	the	tapering	schedule.	However,	minor	increases	in	the	ESR	
and/or	 CRP	 can	 occur	 as	 glucocorticoids	 are	 being	 tapered	 and	
do	 not	 necessarily	 reflect	 an	 exacerbation	 of	 arteritis,	 particularly	
if	 the	 patient	 remains	 symptom-free.	 Under	 these	 circumstances,	
the	tapering	should	continue	with	caution.	Glucocorticoid	toxicity	
occurs	in	35–65%	of	patients	and	represents	an	important	cause	of	
patient	morbidity.

Tocilizumab	 (anti-IL-6	 receptor)	 was	 found	 to	 be	 effective	 in	
giant	cell	arteritis	in	a	randomized	trial	and	is	FDA	approved	for	
this	indication.	The	recommended	dose	of	tocilizumab	is	162	mg	
given	 subcutaneously	 once	 every	 week	 or	 once	 every	 other	 week	
in	 combination	 with	 a	 tapering	 course	 of	 glucocorticoids.	 The	
decision	about	when	to	use	tocilizumab	in	giant	cell	arteritis	is	indi-
vidually	based,	taking	into	account	patient	comorbidities,	potential	
for	 glucocorticoid	 toxicity,	 and	 the	 side	 effects	 of	 tocilizumab.	 By	
nature	of	its	mechanism	of	action,	tocilizumab	impacts	laboratory	
parameters	of	ESR	and	CRP,	which	will	eliminate	the	ability	to	uti-
lize	these	in	disease	activity	assessment.

The	 use	 of	 methotrexate	 as	 a	 glucocorticoid-sparing	 agent	 has	
been	 examined	 in	 two	 randomized	 placebo-controlled	 trials	 that	
reached	 conflicting	 conclusions.	 It	 may	 be	 considered	 in	 select	
patients	 with	 glucocorticoid	 toxicity	 who	 are	 unable	 to	 take	 or	
intolerant	of	tocilizumab.

Abatacept	(CTLA4-Ig)	was	examined	in	a	small	randomized	trial	
in	giant	cell	arteritis	and	demonstrated	greater	efficacy	than	gluco-
corticoids	 alone.	 Infliximab,	 a	 monoclonal	 antibody	 to	 TNF,	 was	
studied	in	a	randomized	trial	and	was	not	found	to	provide	benefit.
Aspirin	81	mg	daily	has	been	found	to	reduce	the	occurrence	of	
cranial	ischemic	complications	in	giant	cell	arteritis	and	should	be	
given	 in	 addition	 to	 glucocorticoids	 in	 patients	 who	 do	 not	 have	
contraindications.

Patients	with	isolated	polymyalgia	rheumatica	respond	promptly	
to	prednisone,	which	can	be	started	at	a	lower	dose	of	10–20	mg/d.	
Similar	to	giant	cell	arteritis,	the	ESR	and/or	CRP	can	serve	as	a	use-
ful	 indicator	 in	 monitoring	 and	 prednisone	 reduction.	 Recurrent	
polymyalgia	symptoms	develop	in	the	majority	of	patients	during	
prednisone	tapering.	One	study	of	methotrexate	found	that	the	use	
of	this	drug	reduced	the	prednisone	dose	on	average	by	only	1	mg	
and	did	not	decrease	prednisone-related	side	effects.	A	randomized	
trial	 in	 polymyalgia	 rheumatica	 did	 not	 find	 infliximab	 to	 lessen	
relapse	or	glucocorticoid	requirements.

TAKAYASU ARTERITIS
 ■ DEFINITION
Takayasu arteritis	is	an	inflammatory	and	stenotic	disease	of	medium-	
and	large-sized	arteries	characterized	by	a	strong	predilection	for	the	
aortic	arch	and	its	branches.
 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
Takayasu	arteritis	is	an	uncommon	disease	with	an	estimated	annual	
incidence	rate	of	1.2–2.6	cases	per	million.	It	is	most	prevalent	in	ado-
lescent	girls	and	young	women.	Although	it	is	more	common	in	Asia,	
it	is	neither	racially	nor	geographically	restricted.
 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The	disease	involves	medium-	and	large-sized	arteries,	with	a	strong	
predilection	for	the	aortic	arch	and	its	branches;	the	pulmonary	artery	
may	 also	 be	 involved.	 The	 most	 commonly	 affected	 arteries	 seen	 by	
arteriography	are	listed	in	Table 363-7.	The	involvement	of	the	major	
branches	of	the	aorta	is	much	more	marked	at	their	origin	than	dis-
tally.	 The	 disease	 is	 a	 panarteritis	 with	 inflammatory	 mononuclear	
cell	 infiltrates	 and	 occasionally	 giant	 cells.	 There	 are	 marked	 intimal	
proliferation	 and	 fibrosis,	 scarring	 and	 vascularization	 of	 the	 media,	
and	 disruption	 and	 degeneration	 of	 the	 elastic	 lamina.	 Narrowing	 of	
the	lumen	occurs	with	or	without	thrombosis.	The	vasa	vasorum	are	
frequently	 involved.	 Pathologic	 changes	 in	 various	 organs	 reflect	 the	
compromise	of	blood	flow	through	the	involved	vessels.

Immunopathogenic	 mechanisms,	 the	 precise	 nature	 of	 which	 is	
uncertain,	are	suspected	in	this	disease.	As	with	several	of	the	vasculitis	
syndromes,	 circulating	 immune	 complexes	 have	 been	 demonstrated,	
but	their	pathogenic	significance	is	unclear.
 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS
Takayasu	arteritis	is	a	systemic	disease	with	generalized	as	well	as	vascu-
lar	symptoms.	The	generalized	symptoms	include	malaise,	fever,	night	
sweats,	arthralgias,	anorexia,	and	weight	loss,	which	may	occur	months	
before	vessel	involvement	is	apparent.	These	symptoms	may	merge	into	
those	 related	 to	 vascular	 compromise	 and	 organ	 ischemia.	 Pulses	 are	
commonly	 absent	 in	 the	 involved	 vessels,	 particularly	 the	 subclavian	
artery.	The	frequency	of	arteriographic	abnormalities	and	the	potentially	
associated	clinical	manifestations	are	listed	in	Table	363-7.	Hypertension	
occurs	in	32–93%	of	patients	and	contributes	to	renal,	cardiac,	and	cere-
bral	injury.

Characteristic	 laboratory	 findings	 include	 an	 elevated	 ESR	 and/or	

CRP,	mild	anemia,	and	elevated	immunoglobulin	levels.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	diagnosis	of	Takayasu	arteritis	should	be	suspected	strongly	in	a	
young	woman	who	develops	a	decrease	or	absence	of	peripheral	pulses,	
discrepancies	 in	 blood	 pressure,	 and	 arterial	 bruits.	 The	 diagnosis	
is	 confirmed	 by	 the	 characteristic	 pattern	 on	 arteriography,	 which	
includes	irregular	vessel	walls,	stenosis,	poststenotic	dilation,	aneurysm	
formation,	occlusion,	and	evidence	of	increased	collateral	circulation.	
Complete	imaging	of	the	aorta	and	its	major	branches	by	magnetic	res-
onance	or	computed	tomography	arteriography	should	be	obtained	to	
fully	delineate	the	distribution	and	degree	of	arterial	disease.	Because	
of	 the	 involvement	 of	 the	 large	 vessels,	 tissue	 is	 rarely	 available	 as	 a	
means	of	diagnosis	and	obtained	only	if	vascular	surgery	is	necessary.	
IgG4-related	 disease	 (Chap.  368)	 is	 a	 potential	 cause	 of	 aortitis	 and	
periaortitis	that	is	histologically	differentiated	from	Takayasu	arteritis	
by	a	dense	lymphoplasmacytic	infiltrate	rich	in	IgG4-positive	plasma	
cells,	a	storiform	pattern	of	fibrosis,	and	obliterative	phlebitis.

TREATMENT
Takayasu Arteritis

The	long-term	outcome	of	patients	with	Takayasu	arteritis	has	var-
ied	widely	between	studies.	Although	two	North	American	reports	
found	overall	survival	to	be	≥94%,	the	5-year	mortality	rate	from	
other	studies	has	ranged	from	0	to	35%.	Disease-related	mortality	
most	 often	 occurs	 from	 congestive	 heart	 failure,	 cerebrovascular	
events,	 myocardial	 infarction,	 aneurysm	 rupture,	 or	 renal	 failure.	
Even	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 life-threatening	 disease,	 Takayasu	 arteritis	
can	be	associated	with	significant	morbidity.	The	course	of	the	dis-
ease	is	variable,	and	although	spontaneous	remissions	may	occur,	
Takayasu	 arteritis	 is	 most	 often	 chronic	 and	 relapsing.	 Although	
glucocorticoid	 therapy	 in	 doses	 of	 40–60	 mg	 prednisone	 per	 day	
alleviates	 symptoms,	 there	 are	 no	 convincing	 studies	 that	 indi-
cate	 that	 it	 increases	 survival.	 The	 combination	 of	 glucocorticoid	
therapy	 for	 acute	 signs	 and	 symptoms	 and	 an	 aggressive	 surgical	
and/or	 arterioplastic	 approach	 to	 stenosed	 vessels	 has	 markedly	
improved	outcome	and	decreased	morbidity	by	lessening	the	risk	
of	stroke,	correcting	hypertension	due	to	renal	artery	stenosis,	and	
improving	 blood	 flow	 to	 ischemic	 viscera	 and	 limbs.	 Unless	 it	 is	
urgently	 required,	 surgical	 correction	 of	 stenosed	 arteries	 should	
be	undertaken	only	when	the	vascular	inflammatory	process	is	well	
controlled	with	medical	therapy.

In	 individuals	 who	 are	 refractory	 to	 or	 unable	 to	 taper	 gluco-
corticoids,	methotrexate	in	doses	up	to	25	mg	per	week	has	yielded	
encouraging	 results.	 Results	 from	 retrospective	 series	 with	 anti-
TNF	 therapies	 have	 been	 encouraging,	 but	 these	 agents	 have	 not	
been	studied	through	randomized	trials	to	determine	efficacy.

Abatacept	 was	 examined	 in	 the	 first	 randomized	 trial	 to	 be	
conducted	 in	 Takayasu	 arteritis	 but	 did	 not	 demonstrate	 efficacy	
beyond	 glucocorticoids	 alone.	 Tocilizumab	 has	 been	 investigated	
in	 a	 randomized	 trial	 where	 it	 did	 not	 reach	 its	 primary	 efficacy	
endpoint.	In	this	study,	it	was	found	to	have	secondary	benefits	and	
encouraging	 results	 have	 also	 been	 seen	 in	 retrospective	 studies	
such	that	the	utility	of	this	agent	remains	an	active	question.

IgA VASCULITIS (HENOCH-SCHÖNLEIN)
 ■ DEFINITION
IgA  vasculitis  (Henoch-Schönlein)	 is	 a	 small-vessel	 vasculitis	 charac-
terized	 by	 palpable	 purpura	 (most	 commonly	 distributed	 over	 the	
buttocks	and	lower	extremities),	arthralgias,	gastrointestinal	signs	and	
symptoms,	and	glomerulonephritis.
 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
IgA	vasculitis	(Henoch-Schönlein)	is	usually	seen	in	children	ages	4–7	
years;	however,	the	disease	may	also	be	seen	in	infants	and	adults.	It	is	
not	a	rare	disease;	in	one	series,	it	accounted	for	between	5	and	24	admis-
sions	per	year	at	a	pediatric	hospital.	The	male-to-female	ratio	is	1.5:1.	A	
seasonal	variation	with	a	peak	incidence	in	spring	has	been	noted.

 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The	presumptive	pathogenic	mechanism	for	IgA	(Henoch-Schönlein)	
vasculitis	is	immune-complex	deposition.	A	number	of	inciting	anti-
gens	have	been	suggested	including	upper	respiratory	tract	infections,	
various	drugs,	foods,	insect	bites,	and	immunizations.	IgA	is	the	anti-
body	 class	 most	 often	 seen	 in	 the	 immune	 complexes	 and	 has	 been	
demonstrated	in	the	renal	biopsies	of	these	patients.

 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS
In	pediatric	patients,	palpable	purpura	is	seen	in	virtually	all	patients;	
most	patients	develop	polyarthralgias	in	the	absence	of	frank	arthritis.	
Gastrointestinal	involvement,	which	is	seen	in	almost	70%	of	pediatric	
patients,	is	characterized	by	colicky	abdominal	pain	usually	associated	
with	 nausea,	 vomiting,	 diarrhea,	 or	 constipation,	 and	 is	 frequently	
accompanied	 by	 the	 passage	 of	 blood	 and	 mucus	 per	 rectum;	 bowel	
intussusception	 may	 occur.	 Renal	 involvement	 occurs	 in	 10–50%	
of	 patients	 and	 is	 usually	 characterized	 by	 mild	 glomerulonephritis	
leading	 to	 proteinuria	 and	 microscopic	 hematuria,	 with	 red	 blood	
cell	casts	in	the	majority	of	patients;	it	usually	resolves	spontaneously	
without	therapy.	Rarely,	a	progressive	glomerulonephritis	will	develop.	
In	adults,	presenting	symptoms	are	most	frequently	related	to	the	skin	
and	joints,	while	initial	complaints	related	to	the	gut	are	less	common.	
Although	certain	studies	have	found	that	renal	disease	is	more	frequent	
and	more	severe	in	adults,	this	has	not	been	a	consistent	finding.	How-
ever,	the	course	of	renal	disease	in	adults	may	be	more	insidious	and	
thus	 requires	 close	 follow-up.	 Myocardial	 involvement	 can	 occur	 in	
adults	but	is	rare	in	children.

Laboratory	 studies	 generally	 show	 a	 mild	 leukocytosis,	 a	 normal	
platelet	 count,	 and	 occasionally	 eosinophilia.	 Serum	 complement	
components	are	normal,	and	IgA	levels	are	elevated	in	about	one-half	
of	patients.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	diagnosis	of	IgA	vasculitis	(Henoch-Schönlein)	is	based	on	clinical	
signs	and	symptoms.	Skin	biopsy	specimen	can	be	useful	in	confirming	
leukocytoclastic	vasculitis	with	IgA	and	C3	deposition	by	immunofluo-
rescence.	Renal	biopsy	is	rarely	needed	for	diagnosis	but	may	provide	
prognostic	information	in	some	patients.

TREATMENT
IgA Vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein)

The	 prognosis	 of	 IgA	 vasculitis	 (Henoch-Schönlein)	 is	 excellent.	
Mortality	 is	 exceedingly	 rare,	 and	 1–5%	 of	 children	 progress	 to	
end-stage	renal	disease.	Most	patients	recover	completely,	and	some	
do	not	require	therapy.	When	glucocorticoids	are	required,	predni-
sone,	1	mg/kg	per	day	and	tapered	according	to	clinical	response,	
has	been	shown	to	be	useful	in	decreasing	tissue	edema,	arthralgias,	
and	 abdominal	 discomfort;	 however,	 it	 has	 not	 proved	 beneficial	
in	 the	 treatment	 of	 skin	 or	 renal	 disease	 and	 does	 not	 appear	 to	
shorten	the	duration	of	active	disease	or	lessen	the	chance	of	recur-
rence.	 Patients	 with	 rapidly	 progressive	 glomerulonephritis	 have	
been	 anecdotally	 reported	 to	 benefit	 from	 glucocorticoids	 used	
in	 combination	 with	 another	 immunosuppressive	 agent.	 Disease	
recurrences	have	been	reported	in	10–40%	of	patients.

CRYOGLOBULINEMIC VASCULITIS
 ■ DEFINITION
Cryoglobulins	are	cold-precipitable	monoclonal	or	polyclonal	immu-
noglobulins.	 Cryoglobulinemia	 may	 be	 associated	 with	 a	 systemic	
vasculitis	 characterized	 by	 palpable	 purpura,	 arthralgias,	 weakness,	
neuropathy,	 and	 glomerulonephritis.	 The	 most	 common	 association	
has	been	with	hepatitis	C,	although	cryoglobulinemia	can	be	observed	
in	association	with	a	variety	of	underlying	disorders	including	multiple	
myeloma,	 lymphoproliferative	 disorders,	 connective	 tissue	 diseases,	
infection,	and	liver	disease	and	can	be	idiopathic.

 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
The	incidence	of	cryoglobulinemic	vasculitis	has	not	been	established.	
It	has	been	estimated	that	5%	of	patients	with	chronic	hepatitis	C	will	
develop	cryoglobulinemic	vasculitis.
 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Skin	 biopsies	 in	 cryoglobulinemic	 vasculitis	 reveal	 an	 inflammatory	
infiltrate	surrounding	and	involving	blood	vessel	walls,	with	fibrinoid	
necrosis,	endothelial	cell	hyperplasia,	and	hemorrhage.	Deposition	of	
immunoglobulin	and	complement	is	common.	Abnormalities	of	unin-
volved	skin	including	basement	membrane	alterations	and	deposits	in	
vessel	walls	may	be	found.	Membranoproliferative	glomerulonephritis	
is	responsible	for	80%	of	all	renal	lesions	in	cryoglobulinemic	vasculitis.
The	association	between	hepatitis	C	and	cryoglobulinemic	vasculitis	
has	been	supported	by	the	high	frequency	of	documented	hepatitis	C	
infection,	the	presence	of	hepatitis	C	RNA	and	anti–hepatitis	C	anti-
bodies	 in	 serum	 cryoprecipitates,	 evidence	 of	 hepatitis	 C	 antigens	 in	
vasculitic	skin	lesions,	and	the	effectiveness	of	antiviral	therapy.	Cur-
rent	evidence	suggests	that	in	the	majority	of	cases,	cryoglobulinemic	
vasculitis	 occurs	 when	 an	 aberrant	 immune	 response	 to	 hepatitis	 C	
infection	 leads	 to	 the	 formation	 of	 immune	 complexes	 consisting	 of	
hepatitis	C	antigens,	polyclonal	hepatitis	C–specific	IgG,	and	monoclo-
nal	IgM	rheumatoid	factor.	The	deposition	of	these	immune	complexes	
in	blood	vessel	walls	triggers	an	inflammatory	cascade	that	results	in	
cryoglobulinemic	vasculitis.

 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS
The	 most	 common	 clinical	 manifestations	 of	 cryoglobulinemic	 vas-
culitis	 are	 cutaneous	 vasculitis,	 arthritis,	 peripheral	 neuropathy,	 and	
glomerulonephritis.	 Renal	 disease	 develops	 in	 10–30%	 of	 patients.	
Life-threatening	rapidly	progressive	glomerulonephritis	or	vasculitis	of	
the	CNS,	gastrointestinal	tract,	or	heart	occurs	infrequently.

The	 presence	 of	 circulating	 cryoprecipitates	 is	 the	 fundamental	
finding	 in	 cryoglobulinemic	 vasculitis.	 Rheumatoid	 factor	 is	 almost	
always	found	and	may	be	a	useful	clue	to	the	disease	when	cryoglobu-
lins	are	not	detected.	Hypocomplementemia	occurs	in	90%	of	patients.	
An	elevated	ESR	and/or	CRP	and	anemia	occur	frequently.	Evidence	
for	hepatitis	C	infection	must	be	sought	in	all	patients	by	testing	for	
hepatitis	C	antibodies	and	hepatitis	C	RNA.

TREATMENT
Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis

Acute	mortality	directly	from	cryoglobulinemic	vasculitis	is	uncom-
mon,	but	the	presence	of	glomerulonephritis	is	a	poor	prognostic	
sign	for	overall	outcome.	In	such	patients,	15%	progress	to	end-
stage	 renal	 disease,	 with	 40%	 later	 experiencing	 fatal	 cardiovas-
cular	 disease,	 infection,	 or	 liver	 failure.	 As	 indicated	 above,	 the	
majority	of	cases	are	associated	with	hepatitis	C	infection.	In	such	
patients,	treatment	with	antiviral	therapy	(Chap. 341)	is	first-line	
therapy	 for	 hepatitis	 C–associated	 cryoglobulinemic	 vasculitis,	
particularly	 given	 the	 efficacy	 of	 current	 hepatitis	 C	 therapies.	
Clinical	improvement	with	antiviral	therapy	is	dependent	on	the	
virologic	response.	Patients	who	clear	hepatitis	C	from	the	blood	
have	objective	improvement	in	their	vasculitis	along	with	signifi-
cant	 reductions	 in	 levels	 of	 circulating	 cryoglobulins,	 IgM,	 and	
rheumatoid	factor.	While	transient	improvement	can	be	observed	
with	 glucocorticoids,	 a	 complete	 response	 is	 seen	 in	 only	 7%	 of	
patients.	Plasmapheresis	and	cytotoxic	agents	have	been	used	in	
anecdotal	 reports.	 These	 observations	 have	 not	 been	 confirmed,	
and	such	therapies	carry	significant	risks.	Randomized	trials	with	
rituximab	 in	 hepatitis	 C–associated	 cryoglobulinemic	 vasculitis	
have	provided	evidence	of	benefit	such	that	this	agent	should	be	
considered	in	patients	with	active	vasculitis	either	in	combination	
with	 antiviral	 therapy	 or	 alone	 in	 patients	 who	 have	 relapsed	
through,	 are	 intolerant	 to,	 or	 have	 contraindications	 to	 antiviral	
agents.

SINGLE-ORGAN VASCULITIS
Single-organ	vasculitis	has	been	defined	as	vasculitis	in	arteries	or	veins	
of	any	size	in	a	single	organ	that	has	no	features	that	indicate	that	it	is	
a	limited	expression	of	a	systemic	vasculitis.	Examples	include	isolated	
aortitis,	testicular	vasculitis,	vasculitis	of	the	breast,	isolated	cutaneous	
vasculitis,	and	primary	CNS	vasculitis.	In	some	instances,	this	may	be	
discovered	at	the	time	of	surgery	such	as	orchiectomy	for	a	testicular	
mass	where	there	is	concern	for	neoplasm	that	is	found	instead	to	be	
vasculitis.	 Some	 patients	 originally	 diagnosed	 with	 single-organ	 vas-
culitis	may	later	develop	additional	manifestations	of	a	more	systemic	
disease.	In	instances	where	there	is	no	evidence	of	systemic	vasculitis	
and	 the	 affected	 organ	 has	 been	 removed	 in	 its	 entirety,	 the	 patient	
may	be	followed	closely	without	immunosuppressive	therapy.	In	other	
instances,	such	as	primary	CNS	vasculitis	or	some	patients	with	iso-
lated	cutaneous	vasculitis,	medical	intervention	is	warranted.

IDIOPATHIC CUTANEOUS VASCULITIS
 ■ DEFINITION
The	 term	 cutaneous  vasculitis	 is	 defined	 broadly	 as	 inflammation	 of	
the	blood	vessels	of	the	dermis.	Because	of	its	heterogeneity,	cutaneous	
vasculitis	 has	 been	 described	 by	 a	 variety	 of	 terms	 including	 hyper-
sensitivity  vasculitis	 and	 cutaneous  leukocytoclastic  angiitis.	 However,	
cutaneous	 vasculitis	 is	 not	 one	 specific	 disease	 but	 a	 manifestation	
that	can	be	seen	in	a	variety	of	settings.	In	>70%	of	cases,	cutaneous	
vasculitis	occurs	either	as	part	of	a	primary	systemic	vasculitis	or	as	a	
secondary	vasculitis	related	to	an	inciting	agent	or	an	underlying	dis-
ease	(see	“Secondary	Vasculitis,”	below).	In	the	remaining	30%	of	cases,	
cutaneous	vasculitis	occurs	idiopathically.
 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
Cutaneous	 vasculitis	 represents	 the	 most	 commonly	 encountered	
vasculitis	in	clinical	practice.	The	exact	incidence	of	idiopathic	cuta-
neous	vasculitis	has	not	been	determined	due	to	the	predilection	for	
cutaneous	vasculitis	to	be	associated	with	an	underlying	process	and	
the	variability	of	its	clinical	course.
 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
The	typical	histopathologic	feature	of	cutaneous	vasculitis	is	the	pres-
ence	 of	 vasculitis	 of	 small	 vessels.	 Postcapillary	 venules	 are	 the	 most	
commonly	involved	vessels;	capillaries	and	arterioles	may	be	involved	
less	 frequently.	 This	 vasculitis	 is	 characterized	 by	 a	 leukocytoclasis,	 a	
term	that	refers	to	the	nuclear	debris	remaining	from	the	neutrophils	
that	have	infiltrated	in	and	around	the	vessels	during	the	acute	stages.	
In	the	subacute	or	chronic	stages,	mononuclear	cells	predominate;	in	
certain	subgroups,	eosinophilic	infiltration	is	seen.	Erythrocytes	often	
extravasate	 from	 the	 involved	 vessels,	 leading	 to	 palpable	 purpura.	
Cutaneous arteritis	can	also	occur,	which	involves	slightly	larger-sized	
vessels	within	the	dermis.
 ■ CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS
The	hallmark	of	idiopathic	cutaneous	vasculitis	is	the	predominance	of	
skin	involvement.	Skin	lesions	may	appear	typically	as	palpable	purpura;	
however,	 other	 cutaneous	 manifestations	 of	 the	 vasculitis	 may	 occur,	
including	 macules,	 papules,	 vesicles,	 bullae,	 subcutaneous	 nodules,	
ulcers,	and	recurrent	or	chronic	urticaria.	The	skin	lesions	may	be	pru-
ritic	or	painful,	with	a	burning	or	stinging	sensation.	Lesions	most	com-
monly	occur	in	the	lower	extremities	in	ambulatory	patients	or	in	the	
sacral	area	in	bedridden	patients	due	to	the	effects	of	hydrostatic	forces	
on	the	postcapillary	venules.	Edema	may	accompany	certain	lesions,	and	
hyperpigmentation	often	occurs	in	areas	of	recurrent	or	chronic	lesions.
There	are	no	specific	laboratory	tests	diagnostic	of	idiopathic	cuta-
neous	 vasculitis.	 A	 mild	 leukocytosis	 with	 or	 without	 eosinophilia	 is	
characteristic,	 as	 is	 an	 elevated	 ESR	 and/or	 CRP.	 Laboratory	 studies	
should	be	aimed	toward	ruling	out	features	to	suggest	an	underlying	
disease	or	a	systemic	vasculitis.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	diagnosis	of	cutaneous	vasculitis	is	made	by	the	demonstration	of	
vasculitis	on	biopsy.	An	important	diagnostic	principle	in	patients	with	

cutaneous	vasculitis	is	to	search	for	an	etiology	of	the	vasculitis—be	it	
an	exogenous	agent,	such	as	a	drug	or	an	infection,	or	an	endogenous	
condition,	 such	 as	 an	 underlying	 disease	 (Fig.	 363-1).	 In	 addition,	 a	
careful	 physical	 and	 laboratory	 examination	 should	 be	 performed	 to	
rule	out	the	possibility	of	systemic	vasculitis.	This	should	start	with	the	
least	 invasive	 diagnostic	 approach	 and	 proceed	 to	 the	 more	 invasive	
only	if	clinically	indicated.

TREATMENT
Idiopathic Cutaneous Vasculitis

When	 an	 antigenic	 stimulus	 is	 recognized	 as	 the	 precipitating	
factor	in	the	cutaneous	vasculitis,	it	should	be	removed;	if	this	is	a	
microbe,	appropriate	antimicrobial	therapy	should	be	instituted.	If	
the	vasculitis	is	associated	with	another	underlying	disease,	treat-
ment	of	the	latter	often	results	in	resolution	of	the	former.	In	situ-
ations	 where	 disease	 is	 apparently	 self-limited,	 no	 therapy,	 except	
possibly	 symptomatic	 therapy,	 is	 indicated.	 When	 cutaneous	 vas-
culitis	persists	and	when	there	is	no	evidence	of	an	inciting	agent,	
an	 associated	 disease,	 or	 an	 underlying	 systemic	 vasculitis,	 the	
decision	to	treat	should	be	based	on	weighing	the	balance	between	
the	 degree	 of	 symptoms	 and	 the	 risk	 of	 treatment.	 Some	 cases	 of	
idiopathic	cutaneous	vasculitis	resolve	spontaneously,	whereas	oth-
ers	remit	and	relapse.	In	patients	with	persistent	vasculitis,	a	variety	
of	 therapeutic	 regimens	 have	 been	 tried	 with	 variable	 results.	 In	
general,	 the	 treatment	 of	 idiopathic	 cutaneous	 vasculitis	 has	 not	
been	satisfactory.	Fortunately,	since	the	disease	is	generally	limited	
to	the	skin,	this	lack	of	consistent	response	to	therapy	usually	does	
not	 lead	 to	 a	 life-threatening	 situation.	 Agents	 with	 which	 there	
have	been	anecdotal	reports	of	success	include	dapsone,	colchicine,	
hydroxychloroquine,	 and	 nonsteroidal	 anti-inflammatory	 agents.	
Glucocorticoids	 are	 often	 used	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	 idiopathic	
cutaneous	 vasculitis.	 Therapy	 is	 usually	 instituted	 as	 prednisone	 	
1	mg/kg	per	day,	with	rapid	tapering	where	possible,	either	directly	
to	 discontinuation	 or	 by	 conversion	 to	 an	 alternate-day	 regimen	
followed	by	ultimate	discontinuation.	In	cases	that	prove	refractory	
to	glucocorticoids,	a	trial	of	another	immunosuppressive	agent	may	
be	indicated.	Patients	with	chronic	vasculitis	isolated	to	cutaneous	
venules	 rarely	 respond	 dramatically	 to	 any	 therapeutic	 regimen,	
and	 cytotoxic	 agents	 should	 be	 used	 only	 as	 a	 last	 resort	 in	 these	
patients.	 Methotrexate	 and	 azathioprine	 have	 been	 used	 in	 such	
situations	in	anecdotal	reports.	Although	cyclophosphamide	is	the	
most	effective	therapy	for	the	systemic	vasculitides,	it	should	almost	
never	 be	 used	 for	 idiopathic	 cutaneous	 vasculitis	 because	 of	 the	
potential	toxicity.

PRIMARY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM 
VASCULITIS
Primary  CNS  vasculitis	 is	 an	 uncommon	 clinicopathologic	 entity	
characterized	by	vasculitis	restricted	to	the	vessels	of	the	CNS	without	
other	apparent	systemic	vasculitis.	The	inflammatory	process	is	usually	
composed	of	mononuclear	cell	infiltrates	with	or	without	granuloma	
formation.

Patients	may	present	with	headaches,	altered	mental	function,	and	
focal	neurologic	defects.	Systemic	symptoms	are	generally	absent.	Dev-
astating	neurologic	abnormalities	may	occur	depending	on	the	extent	
of	 vessel	 involvement.	 The	 diagnosis	 can	 be	 suggested	 by	 abnormal	
magnetic	resonance	imaging	of	the	brain,	an	abnormal	lumbar	punc-
ture,	 and/or	 demonstration	 of	 characteristic	 vessel	 abnormalities	 on	
arteriography	(Fig. 363-4),	but	it	is	confirmed	by	biopsy	of	the	brain	
parenchyma	and	leptomeninges.	In	the	absence	of	a	brain	biopsy,	care	
should	be	taken	not	to	misinterpret	as	true	primary	vasculitis	arterio-
graphic	abnormalities	that	might	actually	be	related	to	another	cause.	
An	important	entity	in	the	differential	diagnosis	is	reversible	cerebral	
vasoconstrictive	 syndrome,	 which	 typically	 presents	 with	 “thunder-
clap”	headache	and	is	associated	with	arteriographic	abnormalities	that	
mimic	 primary	 CNS	 vasculitis	 that	 are	 reversible.	 Other	 diagnostic

artery.	Other	manifestations	include	pericarditis,	myocarditis,	myocar-
dial	ischemia	and	infarction,	and	cardiomegaly.

Apart	from	the	up	to	2.8%	of	patients	who	develop	fatal	complica-
tions,	the	prognosis	of	this	disease	for	uneventful	recovery	is	excellent.	
High-dose	IV	γ-globulin	(2	g/kg	as	a	single	infusion	over	10	h)	together	
with	aspirin	(100	mg/kg/d	for	14	days	followed	by	3–5	mg/kg	per	day	
for	several	weeks)	has	been	shown	to	be	effective	in	reducing	the	prev-
alence	of	coronary	artery	abnormalities	when	administered	early	in	the	
course	of	the	disease.	Surgery	may	be	necessary	for	Kawasaki	disease	
patients	who	have	giant	coronary	artery	aneurysms	or	other	coronary	
complications.	 Surgical	 treatment	 most	 commonly	 includes	 throm-
boendarterectomy,	thrombus	clearing,	aneurysmal	reconstruction,	and	
coronary	artery	bypass	grafting.

Multisystem	 inflammatory	 syndrome	 (MIS-C),	 a	 serious	 condi-
tion	 that	 may	 resemble	 Kawasaki’s	 disease,	 has	 been	 observed	 with	
infections	 due	 to	 the	 novel	 coronavirus,	 SARS-CoV-2	 (Chap.  199).	
Although	 clinical	 features	 consistent	 with	 Kawasaki’s	 disease	 have	
been	observed,	these	patients	can	also	have	manifestations	atypical	for	
Kawasaki’s	disease,	including	gastrointestinal	symptoms,	myocarditis,	
neurocognitive	symptoms,	and	shock.	Any	patient	who	presents	with	
a	clinical	picture	suggestive	of	Kawasaki’s	disease	should	be	tested	for	
SARS-CoV-2	to	guide	care	and	management.

POLYANGIITIS OVERLAP SYNDROMES
Some	 patients	 with	 systemic	 vasculitis	 manifest	 clinicopathologic	
characteristics	 that	 do	 not	 fit	 precisely	 into	 any	 specific	 disease	 but	
have	overlapping	features	of	different	vasculitides.	The	diagnostic	and	
therapeutic	 considerations	 as	 well	 as	 the	 prognosis	 for	 these	 patients	
depend	 on	 the	 sites	 and	 severity	 of	 active	 vasculitis.	 Patients	 with	
vasculitis	that	could	potentially	cause	irreversible	damage	to	a	major	
organ	 system	 should	 be	 treated	 as	 described	 under	 “Granulomatosis	
with	Polyangiitis.”

SECONDARY VASCULITIS
 ■ DRUG-INDUCED VASCULITIS
Vasculitis	associated	with	drug	reactions	usually	presents	as	palpable	
purpura	 that	 may	 be	 generalized	 or	 limited	 to	 the	 lower	 extremities	
or	 other	 dependent	 areas;	 however,	 urticarial	 lesions,	 ulcers,	 and	
hemorrhagic	blisters	may	also	occur	(Chap. 60).	Signs	and	symptoms	
may	be	limited	to	the	skin,	although	systemic	manifestations	such	as	
fever,	 malaise,	 and	 polyarthralgias	 may	 occur.	 Although	 the	 skin	 is	
the	 predominant	 organ	 involved,	 systemic	 vasculitis	 may	 result	 from	
drug	reactions.	Drugs	that	have	been	implicated	in	vasculitis	include	
allopurinol,	 thiazides,	 gold,	 sulfonamides,	 phenytoin,	 and	 penicillin	
(Chap. 60).

An	 increasing	 number	 of	 drugs	 have	 been	 reported	 to	 cause	 vas-
culitis	associated	with	ANCA.	Of	these,	the	best	evidence	of	causality	
exists	for	hydralazine	and	propylthiouracil.	The	clinical	manifestations	
in	ANCA-positive	drug-induced	vasculitis	can	range	from	cutaneous	
lesions	to	glomerulonephritis	and	pulmonary	hemorrhage.	Outside	of	
drug	discontinuation,	treatment	should	be	based	on	the	severity	of	the	
vasculitis.	Patients	with	immediately	life-threatening	small-vessel	vas-
culitis	should	initially	be	treated	with	glucocorticoids	and	cyclophos-
phamide	as	described	for	granulomatosis	with	polyangiitis.	Following	
clinical	 improvement,	 consideration	 may	 be	 given	 for	 tapering	 such	
agents	along	a	more	rapid	schedule.

 ■ SERUM SICKNESS AND SERUM SICKNESS–LIKE 
REACTIONS
These	reactions	are	characterized	by	the	occurrence	of	fever,	urticaria,	
polyarthralgias,	and	lymphadenopathy	7–10	days	after	primary	expo-
sure	and	2–4	days	after	secondary	exposure	to	a	heterologous	protein	
(classic	serum	sickness)	or	a	nonprotein	drug	such	as	penicillin	or	sulfa	
(serum	sickness–like	reaction).	Most	of	the	manifestations	are	not	due	
to	a	vasculitis;	however,	occasional	patients	will	have	typical	cutaneous	
venulitis	that	may	progress	rarely	to	a	systemic	vasculitis.

FIGURE 363-4  Cerebral arteriogram from a 32-year-old man with primary central 
nervous system vasculitis. Dramatic beading (arrow) typical of vasculitis is seen.

considerations	 include	 infection,	 atherosclerosis,	 emboli,	 connective	
tissue	 disease,	 sarcoidosis,	 malignancy,	 and	 drug-associated	 causes.	
The	 prognosis	 of	 granulomatous	 primary	 CNS	 vasculitis	 is	 poor;	
however,	 some	 reports	 indicate	 that	 glucocorticoid	 therapy,	 alone	 or	
together	with	cyclophosphamide	administered	as	described	above,	has	
induced	 clinical	 remissions.	 Following	 disease	 remission,	 cyclophos-
phamide	is	switched	to	azathioprine	or	mycophenolate	mofetil	as	these	
have	good	penetration	into	the	CNS.

BEHÇET’S DISEASE
Behçet’s disease	is	a	clinicopathologic	entity	characterized	by	recurrent	
episodes	 of	 oral	 and	 genital	 ulcers,	 iritis,	 and	 cutaneous	 lesions.	 The	
underlying	pathologic	process	is	a	leukocytoclastic	venulitis,	although	
vessels	of	any	size	and	in	any	organ	can	be	involved.	This disorder is 
described in detail in Chap. 364.

COGAN’S SYNDROME
Cogan’s syndrome	is	characterized	by	interstitial	keratitis	together	with	
vestibuloauditory	symptoms.	It	may	be	associated	with	a	systemic	vas-
culitis,	particularly	aortitis	with	involvement	of	the	aortic	valve.	Glu-
cocorticoids	are	the	mainstay	of	treatment.	Initiation	of	treatment	as	
early	as	possible	after	the	onset	of	hearing	loss	improves	the	likelihood	
of	a	favorable	outcome.

KAWASAKI’S DISEASE
Kawasaki’s disease	is	an	acute,	febrile,	multisystem	disease	of	children.	
Some	80%	of	cases	occur	prior	to	the	age	of	5,	with	the	peak	incidence	
occurring	 at	 ≤2	 years.	 It	 is	 characterized	 by	 nonsuppurative	 cervical	
adenitis	 and	 changes	 in	 the	 skin	 and	 mucous	 membranes	 such	 as	
edema;	congested	conjunctivae;	erythema	of	the	oral	cavity,	lips,	and	
palms;	 and	 desquamation	 of	 the	 skin	 of	 the	 fingertips.	 Although	 the	
disease	is	generally	benign	and	self-limited,	it	is	associated	with	coro-
nary	artery	aneurysms	in	~25%	of	cases,	with	an	overall	case-fatality	
rate	of	0.5–2.8%.	These	complications	usually	occur	between	the	third	
and	fourth	weeks	of	illness	during	the	convalescent	stage.	Vasculitis	of	
the	coronary	arteries	is	seen	in	almost	all	the	fatal	cases	that	have	been	
autopsied	and	can	cause	complications	into	adulthood.	There	is	typical	
intimal	proliferation	and	infiltration	of	the	vessel	wall	with	mononu-
clear	cells.	Beadlike	aneurysms	and	thromboses	may	be	seen	along	the

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disorders ■ VASCULITIS ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER 
UNDERLYING DISEASES
Certain	 infections	 may	 directly	 trigger	 an	 inflammatory	 vasculitic	
process.	For	example,	rickettsias	can	invade	and	proliferate	in	the	endo-
thelial	cells	of	small	blood	vessels	causing	a	vasculitis	(Chap. 187).	In	
addition,	the	inflammatory	response	around	blood	vessels	associated	
with	certain	systemic	fungal	diseases	such	as	histoplasmosis	(Chap. 212)	
may	mimic	a	primary	vasculitic	process.	A	leukocytoclastic	vasculitis	
predominantly	involving	the	skin	with	occasional	involvement	of	other	
organ	systems	may	be	a	minor	component	of	many	other	infections.	
These	include	subacute bacterial endocarditis,	Epstein-Barr virus infec-
tion,	HIV infection,	and	a	number	of	other	infections.

Vasculitis	can	be	associated	with	certain	malignancies,	particularly	
lymphoid	or	reticuloendothelial	neoplasms.	Leukocytoclastic	venulitis	
confined	to	the	skin	is	the	most	common	finding;	however,	widespread	
systemic	vasculitis	may	occur.	Of	particular	note	is	the	association	of	
hairy cell leukemia	(Chap. 110)	with	polyarteritis	nodosa.

A	number	of	connective tissue diseases	have	vasculitis	as	a	secondary	
manifestation	 of	 the	 underlying	 primary	 process.	 Foremost	 among	
these	 are	 systemic  lupus  erythematosus	 (Chap.  356),	 rheumatoid 
arthritis	 (Chap.  358),	 inflammatory  myositis	 (Chap.  365),	 relapsing 
polychondritis	 (Chap.  366),	 and	 Sjögren’s  syndrome	 (Chap.  361).	 The	
most	common	form	of	vasculitis	in	these	conditions	is	the	small-vessel	
venulitis	isolated	to	the	skin.	However,	certain	patients	may	develop	a	
fulminant	systemic	necrotizing	vasculitis.

Secondary	 vasculitis	 has	 also	 been	 observed	 in	 association	 with	
ulcerative colitis,	congenital deficiencies of various complement compo-
nents,	 sarcoidosis,	 primary  biliary  cirrhosis,	 α1-antitrypsin  deficiency,	
and	intestinal bypass surgery.

364 Behçet Syndrome

Yusuf Yazici

Behçet	 syndrome	 is	 a	 systemic	 vasculitis,	 first	 described	 by	 Hulusi	
Behçet,	a	Turkish	dermatologist.	It	can	present	with	skin	and	mucosal	
lesions,	uveitis,	arthritis,	major	arterial	and	venous	vessel	disease,	and	
gastrointestinal	 and	 neurologic	 manifestations.	 These	 manifestations	
can	 be	 present	 in	 various	 combinations	 and	 sequences	 over	 time.	
Patients	are	most	commonly	from	the	Middle	East,	the	Mediterranean	
region,	and	the	Far	East;	it	is	most	prevalent	in	Turkey,	with	a	preva-
lence	 of	 1	 in	 250	 adults.	 It	 is	 relatively	 rare	 before	 the	 late	 teens	 and	
after	 age	 50.	 Males	 and	 females	 are	 equally	 affected;	 however,	 males	
frequently	have	more	severe	disease	and	poorer	outcomes.	Some	man-
ifestations	may	show	regional	differences;	for	example,	gastrointestinal	
involvement,	rare	in	Turkey,	is	more	common	in	Japan	and	is	seen	in	
~30%	of	patients	in	the	United	States.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Behçet	syndrome	is	diagnosed	clinically.	There	are	no	specific	labora-
tory,	imaging,	or	histologic	features	that	can	help	in	the	diagnosis	of	a	
patient	with	suggestive	symptoms,	and	the	diagnosis	is	based	on	a	com-
bination	of	clinical	features	in	the	setting	of	ruling	out	other	potential	
causes.	In	this	regard,	some	patients	may	require	months	to	years	to	
develop	the	array	of	symptoms	that	would	lead	to	a	definitive	diagnosis,	
although	a	tentative	diagnosis	may	be	made	well	before.	The	most	com-
monly	 used	 and	 best	 performing	 diagnostic	 criteria	 are	 the	 Interna-
tional	Study	Group	(ISG)	criteria	(sensitivity	~95%,	specificity	~96%);	
patients	 need	 to	 have	 recurrent	 oral	 ulcers	 plus	 two	 of	 the	 following	
four	clinical	manifestations:	recurrent	genital	ulcers,	skin	lesions,	eye	
lesions,	 or	 a	 positive	 pathergy	 test	 (Table  364-1).	 Additional	 clinical	
manifestations	may	involve	various	organ	systems,	including	the	gas-
trointestinal,	vascular,	pulmonary,	and	central	nervous	systems.	Up	to	
50–60%	of	patients,	depending	on	where	they	are	from,	can	be	positive	
for	HLA	B*51;	however,	it	is	not	used	as	a	diagnostic	test	because	it	is	
also	found	in	up	to	20%	of	the	normal	population.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS
The	 pathogenesis	 and	 etiology	 of	 Behçet	 syndrome	 are	 unknown.	
Family	 studies	 show	 a	 possible	 genetic	 predisposition,	 and	 increased	
inflammation	and	immunologic	mechanisms	play	a	role.	Both	innate	
and	adaptive	immune	systems	may	be	involved.	Unlike	other	autoim-
mune	 diseases,	 however,	 Behçet	 syndrome	 is	 not	 typically	 associated	
with	 autoantibodies,	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon,	 Sjögren’s	 syndrome,	
thrombocytopenia,	 hemolytic	 anemia,	 sun	 hypersensitivity,	 serosal	
involvement,	 or	 an	 increased	 risk	 for	 other	 autoimmune	 diseases.	
On	 the	 other	 hand,	 features	 that	 separate	 it	 from	 autoinflammatory

2818 conditions	include	tendency	to	abate	with	time,	absence	of	mutations	
associated	 with	 autoinflammatory	 diseases,	 and	 higher	 prevalence	
than	typical	autoinflammatory	diseases	such	as	familial	Mediterranean	
fever	 (Chap. 369).	 There	 is	 neutrophil	 hyperreactivity;	 however,	 it	 is	
not	 clear	 whether	 this	 is	 primary	 or	 secondary	 to	 cytokine-directed	
activation.	 There	 is	 also	 evidence	 from	 retrospective	 patient	 cohort	
analyses	 that	 there	 may	 be	 different	 clusters	 of	 disease	 presentation;	
for	example,	acne	lesions	are	more	commonly	seen	with	arthritis	and	
associated	with	enthesitis,	and	each	of	these	clusters	may	have	a	differ-
ent	pathogenesis.
 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION
The	 most	 common	 symptoms	 are	 associated	 with	 mucocutaneous	
tissues.	Oral	ulcers	are	seen	in	virtually	all	patients	and	are	commonly	
the	first	manifestation.	Commonly,	like	ordinary	cancer	sores,	they	are	
usually	 multiple.	 They	 last	 around	 10	 days	 but	 recur	 unless	 treated.	
Only	 the	 uncommon,	 major	 ulcers	 tend	 to	 scar.	 Beneficial	 effects	 of	
dental	and	periodontal	therapies	suggest	that	decreased	oral	health	is	
associated	with	disease	severity.

Genital	ulcers	are	the	most	specific	lesions,	most	commonly	occur-
ring	 on	 the	 scrotum	 or	 labia.	 They	 are	 larger	 and	 deeper	 and	 take	
longer	to	heal	than	oral	ulcers	and	tend	to	form	scars.

Acne-like	or	papulopustular	lesions	are	indistinguishable	from	acne	
vulgaris	in	appearance	and	pathology.	They	are	seen	both	at	the	usual	
acne	sites	as	well	as	at	uncommon	sites	such	as	lower	extremities.	Other	
skin	findings	are	the	nodular	lesions,	which	are	of	two	types:	erythema	
nodosum	lesions	due	to	panniculitis	and	superficial	vein	thromboses.	
Superficial	 thrombophlebitis	 often	 occurs	 in	 men	 and	 is	 associated	
with	deep-vein	thrombosis;	it	should	trigger	workup	for	other	vascular	
involvement,	including	pulmonary	artery	aneurysms.

Pathergy	 reaction	 is	 a	 nonspecific	 hyperreactivity	 of	 the	 skin	 to	
trauma.	Typically,	a	papule	or	pustule	forms	in	24–48	h	after	a	needle	
prick.	It	is	rather	unique	for	Behçet	syndrome	and	is	part	of	the	ISG	
diagnostic	criteria.

Arthralgia	or	arthritis	is	seen	in	about	half	of	patients;	it	is	usually	
a	mono-	or	oligoarthritis	in	the	lower	extremities	and	does	not	usually	
cause	deformity	or	erosions.

Eye	involvement	is	seen	in	half	of	all	patients	and	in	~70%	of	males.	
It	is	most	commonly	a	bilateral	panuveitis.	A	hypopyon,	seen	in	~10%	
of	patients	with	eye	disease,	is	an	intense	inflammation	in	the	anterior	
chamber	 and	 is	 quite	 specific	 for	 Behçet	 syndrome.	 Ocular	 involve-
ment	develops	usually	in	the	first	2	years	after	fulfillment	of	diagnostic	
criteria	and	is	most	severe	during	the	first	few	years	and	then	tends	to	
abate.	 Male	 gender,	 posterior	 involvement,	 frequent	 attacks	 (>3	 per	
year),	strong	vitreous	opacity,	and	macular	edema	are	poor	prognostic	
factors.

Vascular	disease	is	seen	in	up	to	40%	of	patients.	It	is	associated	with	
intensive	thrombosis	and	runs	a	relapsing	course.	Several	well-defined	
venous	 vascular	 associations	 are	 seen,	 and	 superficial	 and	 deep-vein	
thrombosis,	 Budd-Chiari	 syndrome,	 inferior	 vena	 cava	 syndrome,	
pulmonary	artery	involvement,	intracardiac	thrombosis,	and	cerebral	
venous	 sinus	 thrombosis	 frequently	 cluster	 in	 various	 combinations.	
Pulmonary	artery	aneurysms	carry	a	5-year	mortality	rate	of	20–25%.
Prevalence	 of	 neurologic	 involvement	 is	 ~5%,	 with	 about	 three-	
quarters	 of	 patients	 presenting	 with	 parenchymal	 involvement,	 while	
the	 remaining	 cases	 present	 with	 cerebral	 venous	 sinus	 thrombosis.	
These	two	forms	only	rarely	occur	together.	Parenchymal	involvement	
usually	affects	the	telencephalic-diencephalic	junction,	brainstem,	and	
spinal	cord.	Patients	may	present	with	a	subacute	onset	of	severe	head-
ache,	cranial	nerve	palsy,	dysarthria,	ataxia,	and	hemiparesis.

Prevalence	 of	 gastrointestinal	 involvement	 changes	 significantly	
across	different	populations	(up	to	50%	in	the	Far	East	but	rare	in	the	

Middle	East).	Clinical	and	endoscopic	appearance	of	intestinal	involve-
ment	can	be	similar	to,	and	thus	cannot	easily	be	differentiated	from,	
Crohn’s	disease.	Ulcers	tend	to	be	single	or	less	than	five,	are	usually	
confined	to	the	ileocecal	area,	are	more	likely	to	be	deep	and	round,	
and	are	prone	to	perforate;	perianal	and	rectal	area	involvement	is	rare.	
In	practice,	it	is	difficult	to	distinguish	Behçet	syndrome	from	Crohn’s	
disease	unless	extraintestinal	lesions	are	present.

TREATMENT
Behçet Syndrome

Treatment	is	guided	by	type	and	severity	of	involvement,	with	the	
goal	 of	 preventing	 long-term	 damage.	 Most	 new	 manifestations	
present	within	the	first	5	years,	and	for	most	patients,	the	natural	
course	 is	 one	 of	 diminishing	 symptoms	 culminating	 in	 potential	
remission,	frequently	not	requiring	ongoing	treatment	with	medi-
cations.	Patient	characteristics,	such	as	being	young	and	male,	need	
to	be	kept	in	mind	as	these	patients	tend	to	have	a	worse	prognosis.	
For	 most	 patients,	 tapering	 and/or	 stopping	 their	 medications	 in	
2–3	years	after	the	symptoms	have	improved	should	be	attempted.
Oral	ulcers	can	be	managed	with	topical	glucocorticoids	and	on	
an	as-needed	basis	if	mild.	Lesions	resistant	to	local	measures	may	
require	 systemic	 treatment	 with	 colchicine,	 oral	 glucocorticoids,	
immunosuppressants	such	as	apremilast,	azathioprine,	or	a	tumor	
necrosis	factor-α	inhibitor	such	as	infliximab.	Apremilast	has	now	
been	approved	in	the	United	States	and	Japan	for	the	treatment	of	
oral	ulcers	of	Behçet	syndrome.	A	similar	treatment	approach	can	
be	used	for	genital	ulcers	and	other	mucocutaneous	manifestations.	
Patients	may	need	a	combination	of	medications,	at	least	initially,	
to	control	disease	activity.

Eye	 involvement,	 given	 its	 frequency	 and	 potential	 morbid-
ity,	 requires	 early	 and	 aggressive	 treatment	 with	 brief	 courses	 of	
glucocorticoids	 and	 longer-term	 treatment	 with	 an	 immunosup-
pressant.	 Azathioprine	 is	 usually	 the	 preferred	 agent.	 Infliximab,	
adalimumab,	or	cyclosporine	can	also	be	used,	in	combination	with	
systemic	 glucocorticoids	 and	 azathioprine,	 for	 control	 of	 disease	
activity.	Monotherapy	with	interferon	is	another	option.	Glucocor-
ticoids	can	be	tapered	in	many	patients	after	active	disease	has	been	
controlled,	 whereas	 immunosuppressants	 are	 generally	 continued	
for	at	least	2	years.

Gastrointestinal	 involvement	 is	 treated	 with	 a	 glucocorticoid	
plus	an	immunosuppressant	such	as	azathioprine	alone	or	in	com-
bination	with	infliximab.

Venous	 thrombotic	 events	 are	 treated	 by	 controlling	 systemic	
inflammation	 with	 immunosuppressive	 medications	 (usually	 aza-
thioprine	or,	for	more	severe	cases,	cyclophosphamide),	rather	than	
using	anticoagulants.	However,	if	venous	thrombotic	events	occur,	
standard	anticoagulation	treatment	can	be	given,	provided	there	is	
a	low	risk	of	bleeding	and	there	are	no	coexistent	pulmonary	artery	
aneurysms.	For	central	nervous	system	involvement,	the	combina-
tion	of	azathioprine	and	a	tumor	necrosis	factor	inhibitor	is	usually	
the	first	choice.

criteria	employed	in	various	epidemiologic	studies,	increasing	recogni-
tion	of	AS,	and	frequent	misdiagnosis	of	IBM	and	IMNM.	Idiopathic	
PM	 without	 signs	 of	 an	 overlap	 syndrome	 is	 quite	 rare,	 while	 DM,	
IBM,	and	IMNM	occur	in	roughly	similar	frequencies.	DM	can	occur	
in	 children	 (juvenile	 DM),	 while	 IBM	 always	 occurs	 in	 adults	 and	 is	
the	most	common	cause	of	myopathy	in	those	aged	>50.	DM,	PM,	and	
AS	are	more	common	in	women,	while	IBM	is	more	common	in	men.

This	chapter	focuses	on	the	major	types	of	inflammatory	myopathies	
(IMs),	including	dermatomyositis	(DM),	polymyositis	(PM),	immune-
mediated	 necrotizing	 myopathy	 (IMNM),	 antisynthetase	 syndrome	
(AS),	 and	 inclusion	 body	 myositis	 (IBM)	 (Table  365-1).	 Other	 IMs	
include	 those	 caused	 by	 infection,	 eosinophilic	 myositis,	 granuloma-
tous	myositis,	and	myositis	triggered	by	checkpoint	inhibitors.	Of	note,	
inflammatory	 cell	 infiltrates	 can	 also	 be	 occasionally	 seen	 in	 muscle	
biopsies	 in	 hereditary	 (e.g.,	 muscular	 dystrophies,	 metabolic	 myopa-
thies)	and	toxic	myopathies.

Epidemiologic	 studies	 suggest	 that	 the	 incidence	 of	 IM	 grouped	
together	is	>4	cases	per	100,000	with	prevalence	in	the	range	of	14–32	
per	 100,000.	 Defining	 the	 actual	 incidence	 and	 prevalence	 of	 the	
individual	 myositides	 is	 limited,	 however,	 by	 the	 different	 diagnostic	

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH AND 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The	 approach	 to	 patients	 with	 suspected	 myopathy	 is	 detailed	 in	 
Chap. 449.	In	any	patient	presenting	with	weakness,	the	first	step	is	to	
localize	the	site	of	the	lesion	by	history	and	clinical	findings	(Chap. 24).	
Weakness	could	be	caused	by	a	process	in	the	cerebral	hemispheres,	spi-
nal	cord	(Chap. 442),	anterior	horn	cell	(Chap. 437),	peripheral	nerve	
(Chaps.  446-447),	 neuromuscular	 junction	 (Chap.  448),	 or	 muscle	
(Chap. 449).	Past	medical	history,	medication	use,	and	family	history,	
combined	with	a	detailed	clinical	examination	and	an	appreciation	for	
the	 pattern	 of	 muscle	 involvement	 (e.g.,	 what	 muscles	 are	 weak	 and	
atrophic	or	hypertrophic	as	well	as	the	presence	of	scapular	winging,	
early	contractures,	sensory	abnormalities,	fasciculations,	or	rash),	help

differentiate	myopathies	from	other	neuromuscular	disorders	and	the	
different	 types	 of	 myopathies	 from	 each	 other	 (see  Chap.  449).	 For	
example,	 atrophy	 with	 fasciculations	 suggests	 a	 neurogenic	 process	
such	 as	 amyotrophic	 lateral	 sclerosis,	 fatigable	 weakness	 on	 exami-
nation	points	to	a	neuromuscular	junction	defect	such	as	myasthenia	
gravis,	 and	 concomitant	 sensory	 symptoms	 suggest	 a	 central	 process	
such	as	a	spinal	cord	disorder	or	a	polyneuropathy.	Scapular	winging,	
calf	hypertrophy	or	atrophy,	and	early	contractures	before	significant	
weakness	 develops	 would	 strongly	 suggest	 a	 muscular	 dystrophy,	
particularly	if	there	is	a	positive	family	history.	A	heliotrope	rash	com-
bined	with	Gottron	papules	and	dilated	nailfold	capillaries	is	diagnostic	
for	DM.	The	presence	of	atrophy	and	weakness	of	the	flexor	forearm	
muscles	and	quadriceps	in	a	person	aged	>50	years	is	most	likely	IBM.
When	 the	 site	 of	 the	 lesion	 cannot	 be	 localized	 based	 on	 history	
and	clinical	examination	alone,	laboratory	testing	is	required.	Serum	
creatine	kinase	(CK)	is	the	most	sensitive	laboratory	marker	of	muscle	
destruction.	Not	all	myopathies	are	associated	with	elevated	CK	levels,	
but	 a	 markedly	 elevated	 CK	 (e.g.,	 >2000	 U/L)	 is	 almost	 always	 due	
to	a	myopathy.	A	slightly	elevated	CK	can	also	be	seen	in	neurogenic	
disorders,	 however.	 Myositis-associated	 and	 myositis-specific	 anti-
bodies	(MSAs)	help	to	distinguish	subtypes	of	IM,	as	discussed	below.	
Electromyography	 (EMG)	 and	 nerve	 conductions	 studies	 (NCS)	 are	
useful	in	localizing	the	site	of	the	lesion	but	are	less	specific	in	helping	
to	 determine	 the	 actual	 cause	 of	 a	 myopathy.	 EMG	 can	 be	 useful	 at	
times	in	guiding	what	muscle	to	biopsy,	especially	if	muscles	typically	
biopsied	are	normal	on	clinical	examination.	Imaging	skeletal	muscle	
can	 be	 helpful	 in	 assessing	 muscle	 involvement	 and	 revealing	 fatty	
replacement,	atrophy,	or	edema	within	muscle	or	surrounding	fascia.

A	muscle	biopsy	is	usually	required	to	definitively	distinguish	one	
myopathy	from	another.	The	different	forms	of	IM	can	have	distinctive	
histopathologic	abnormalities	as	discussed	below.	In	a	patient	with	a

classic	 DM	 rash,	 a	 muscle	 or	 skin	 biopsy	 can	 be	 performed,	 but	 an	
argument	can	also	be	made	that	biopsy	is	unnecessary—particularly	if	
the	patient	also	has	an	MSA	specific	for	DM.	However,	a	muscle	biopsy	
should	 be	 performed	 in	 every	 case	 of	 suspected	 PM	 to	 exclude	 IBM	
(if	not	clinically	apparent)	and	other	causes	of	myopathy.	Diagnosis	of	
IMNM	is	by	definition	based	upon	histologic	findings.	It	is	important	
to	 biopsy	 a	 muscle	 that	 is	 clinically	 affected	 but	 not	 too	 weak	 (e.g.,	
Medical	Research	Council	grade	4	out	of	5	in	strength);	otherwise,	one	
may	just	see	end-stage	muscle.	A	biopsy	should	always	be	coordinated	
with	an	experienced	muscle	histopathology	laboratory.

Patients	with	severe	muscle	pain,	subjective	weakness,	and	fatigue	
with	 normal	 strength	 and	 function	 on	 examination	 are	 not	 likely	 to	
have	 an	 IM.	 Polymyalgia	 rheumatica	 should	 be	 considered	 in	 older	
individuals	with	an	elevated	erythrocyte	sedimentation	rate	(ESR)	or	
C-reactive	 protein	 (CRP)	 but	 normal	 CK	 and	 EMG.	 Fibromyalgia	 is	
likely	in	patients	with	a	normal	laboratory	workup.	In	general,	a	muscle	
biopsy	is	not	indicated	unless	there	is	objective	weakness,	an	abnormal	
EMG,	or	elevated	CK.
SPECIFIC DISORDERS
 ■ DERMATOMYOSITIS
Clinical Features  DM	manifests	with	symmetric,	proximal	greater	
than	distal	weakness	along	with	a	characteristic	rash	that	includes	the	
heliotrope	rash	(erythematous	discoloration	of	eyelids	with	periorbital	
edema),	 Gottron	 sign	 (erythematous	 rash	 over	 the	 extensor	 surfaces	
of	 joints	 such	 as	 the	 knuckles,	 elbows,	 knees,	 and	 ankles),	 Gottron	
papules	(raised	erythematous	rash	over	knuckles)	(Fig. 365-1),	V-sign	
(rash	 on	 the	 sun-exposed	 anterior	 neck	 and	 chest),	 shawl	 sign	 over	
the	back	of	the	neck	and	shoulders,	nail	bed	telangiectasias,	and	sub-
cutaneous	 calcium	 deposits.	 The	 weakness	 and	 rash	 usually	 accom-
pany	one	another	but	can	be	separated	by	
several	 months.	 Furthermore,	 there	 is	 a	
spectrum	 of	 involvement	 such	 that	 some	
patients	 continue	 to	 manifest	 only	 with	
a	 rash	 (amyopathic	 DM),	 while	 others	
may	 present	 mainly	 with	 weakness	 and	
little	 or	 no	 visible	 skin	 changes.	 Patients	
can	 also	 complain	 of	 myalgias,	 arthral-
gias,	 dysphagia,	 and	 dysarthria.	 Cutane-
ous	 disease	 activity	 is	 highly	 relevant	 in	
DM;	 in	 comparison	 to	 other	 debilitating	
skin	 diseases	 including	 cutaneous	 lupus	
erythematosus,	 psoriasis,	 and	 atopic	 der-
matitis,	 skin	 symptoms	 in	 DM	 patients	
are	 associated	 with	 an	 overall	 reduction	
in	 life	 quality.	 Pruritus	 can	 be	 especially	
debilitating.	 Dyspnea	 can	 occur	 from	
ventilatory	 muscle	 weakness	 or	 intrinsic	
pulmonary	problems	including	interstitial	
lung	 disease	 (ILD),	 bronchopneumonia,	
and	 alveolitis.	 Pulmonary	 manifestations	
are	 often	 associated	 with	 antisynthetase	
antibodies;	 myositis	 associated	 with	 the	
AS	 can	 be	 considered	 a	 distinct	 disorder	
(discussed	below).	DM	can	present	in	chil-
dren	(juvenile	DM)	or	in	adults.	There	is	a	
higher	risk	for	malignancy	in	adult-onset	
cases,	~15%	within	the	first	2–3	years.

nuclear	 matrix	 protein	 2	 (NXP2).	 These	 antibodies	 are	 usually	 asso-
ciated	 with	 characteristic	 clinical	 features.	 For	 example,	 anti-MDA5	
antibodies	 are	 associated	 with	 amyopathic	 DM	 with	 severe	 palmar	
rash,	digital	ulcers,	and	rapidly	progressive	ILD.	Anti-TIF1	(or	p155)	
antibodies	and	anti-NXP2	antibodies	are	associated	with	an	increased	
risk	 of	 cancer,	 while	 anti-Mi-2	 antibodies	 are	 often	 associated	 with	
more	benign	DM	and	a	favorable	response	to	treatment.

EMG	of	weak	muscles	shows	increased	insertional	and	spontaneous	
activity	in	the	form	of	positive	sharp	waves	and	fibrillation	potentials,	
or	complex	repetitive	discharges	along	with	early	recruitment	of	small	
amplitude,	 short	 duration,	 polyphasic	 motor	 units.	 These	 findings	
are	nonspecific	and	can	be	seen	in	other	myopathies.	Skeletal	muscle	
magnetic	resonance	imaging	(MRI	muscle)	reveals	edema	in	affected	
muscles	 and	 sometimes	 more	 specific	 findings	 of	 abnormalities	 of	
fascia	suggesting	fasciitis.

Histopathology  and  Pathogenesis  The	 characteristic	 histo-
pathologic	 abnormality	 on	 muscle	 biopsy	 is	 perifascicular	 atrophy	 
(Fig. 365-2A);	however,	this	is	present	in	perhaps	only	50%	of	patients.	
Immunohistochemical	 staining	 for	 myxovirus	 resistance	 protein	 A	
(MxA)	is	diagnostically	more	sensitive	and	highly	specific	(Fig. 365-2B).	
The	 inflammatory	 cell	 infiltrate	 is	 predominantly	 perivascular	 and	
located	in	the	perimysium	and	is	composed	primarily	of	macrophages,	
B	cells,	and	plasmacytoid	dendritic	cells	(PDCs).	Skin	biopsies	reveal	
cell-poor	interface	dermatitis,	which	is	analogous	to	the	perifascicular	
atrophy	in	that	the	basal	layer	of	keratinocytes	is	most	damaged;	the	
inflammatory	infiltrate	is	typically	absent	or	minimal	and,	when	pres-
ent,	is	located	mainly	at	the	border	zone	of	the	dermis	and	epidermis.
The	 pathogenesis	 of	 DM	 was	 traditionally	 attributed	 to	 an	 anti-

Laboratory  Features  CK	 levels	 are	
always	 elevated	 in	 uncontrolled	 PM.	 A	
normal	CK	should	alert	clinicians	to	the	
possibility	of	IBM.	As	in	DM,	EMG	and	skeletal	muscle	imaging	can	be	
abnormal,	but	the	findings	are	not	specific	(Fig. 365-3).

Histopathology  and  Pathogenesis  Because	 PM	 is	 a	 hetero-
geneous	 category,	 muscle	 pathology	 varies	 substantially.	 Most	 often,	
patients	 with	 nonspecific	 inflammatory	 cells	 present	 in	 perimysial	
more	 often	 than	 endomysial	 locations	 have	 been	 categorized	 as	 PM.	
A	 small	 minority	 of	 patients	 have	 mononuclear	 inflammatory	 infil-
trate	that	surrounds	fibers	with	sarcolemmal	major	histocompatibility	
(MHC-I)	expression	(Fig. 365-4).	There	is	debate	as	to	whether	true	
invasion	of	myofibers	occurs	in	PM,	or	rather	always	indicates	IBM.	
The	 inflammatory	 infiltrate	 predominantly	 consists	 of	 CD8+	 T	 cells	
and	macrophages	located	in	the	endomysial,	perimysial,	and	perivas-
cular	regions.	As	PM	is	heterogeneous,	its	varied	forms	of	pathogenesis	
are	poorly	understood.

Prognosis  Most	patients	with	PM	improve	with	immunotherapies	
but	usually	require	lifelong	treatment.	Some	retrospective	studies	sug-
gest	that	PM	does	not	respond	as	well	as	DM	to	these	therapies.	How-
ever,	many	of	these	older	series	of	“PM”	likely	included	patients	who	
actually	 had	 IMNM,	 IBM,	 or	 other	 myopathies	 (including	 muscular	
dystrophies)	that	do	not	respond	to	immunotherapies.	As	in	DM,	poor	
prognostic	features	are	cancer,	increased	age,	lung	or	cardiac	involve-
ment,	and	late	or	previously	inadequate	treatment.
 ■ OVERLAP SYNDROMES
The	term	overlap syndrome	is	applied	when	DM	or	PM	is	associated	
with	 other	 well-defined	 connective	 tissue	 diseases	 (CTDs)	 such	 as	
scleroderma,	mixed	connective	tissue	disease	(MCTD),	Sjögren’s	syn-
drome,	 systemic	 lupus	 erythematosus	 (SLE),	 or	 rheumatoid	 arthritis.	

body-mediated	 attack	 on	 endothelial	
cells,	 followed	 by	 complement-mediated	
destruction	 of	 capillaries	 and	 watershed	
ischemia	 of	 muscle	 fibers.	 However,	
recent	 studies	 suggest	 that	 this	 is	 not	
likely	 the	 case.	 Immunoglobulin	 depo-
sition	 is	 largely	 absent	 on	 endothelial	
cells,	 and	 complement	 deposition	 may	
be	 a	 secondary	 phenomenon.	 There	 is	
increasing	 evidence	 that	 the	 microvas-
culopathy	 and	 skin	 and	 muscle	 damage	
associated	 with	 DM	 are	 primarily	 due	
to	toxicity	from	type	I	interferon	(IFN)–
mediated	pathways,	most	likely	IFN-β.

Prognosis 
In	 the	 absence	 of	 malig-
nancy,	 prognosis	 is	 generally	 favorable	
in	 patients	 with	 DM,	 with	 5-year	 sur-
vival	rates	ranging	from	70	to	93%.	Poor	
prognostic	 features	 are	 increased	 age,	
associated	 ILD,	 cardiac	 disease,	 and	 late	
or	previous	inadequate	treatment.

demonstrates bright signal indicative of edema/inflammation, particularly in the rectus femoris muscle. This contrasts 
with MRI in IBM in which there is more selective involvement of the vastus lateralis and medialis with relative sparing 
of the rectus femoris (see Fig. 365-7F and G).

infiltrates surrounding nonnecrotic muscle fibers.

As	 in	 DM	 and	 PM,	 the	 myositis	 associated	 with	 these	 overlap	 syn-
dromes	is	usually	responsive	to	immunotherapies.
 ■ IMMUNE-MEDIATED NECROTIZING MYOPATHY
Clinical Features 
IMNM,	 or	 autoimmune	 necrotizing	 myopathy,	
is	characterized	by	the	acute	or	insidious	onset	of	symmetric,	proximal	
more	 than	 distal	 weakness.	 Dysphagia,	 dysarthria,	 or	 myalgia	 may	
occur.	 Patients	 may	 have	 an	 underlying	 CTD	 (usually	 scleroderma	
or	 MCTD)	 or	 cancer	 (paraneoplastic	 necrotizing	 myopathy),	 or	 the	
condition	may	be	idiopathic.	There	are	at	least	two	distinct	forms	of	
IMNM	 associated	 with	 specific	 autoantibodies	 (anti-3-hydroxy-3-
methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme	reductase	[HMGCR]	and	anti-signal	recog-
nition	particle	[SRP]).	Anti-HMGCR	myopathy	can	be	seen	in	patients	
receiving	statins,	inhibitors	of	HMGCR,	particularly	in	patients	aged	
>50	years.	However,	anti-HMGCR	myopathy	can	develop	in	children	
and	young	adults	without	a	history	of	statin	use	and	can	mimic	a	limb	
girdle	muscular	dystrophy.	Unlike	the	more	common	“toxic”	myopathy	
associated	with	statin	use,	anti-HMGCR	myopathy	does	not	improve	
when	statins	are	discontinued.	Anti-SRP	myopathies	are	notable	for	the	
presence	 of	 anti-SRP	 antibodies	 and	 a	 typically	 subacute,	 aggressive,	
and	relatively	refractory	course.

Laboratory Features  CK	 levels	 are	 markedly	 elevated	 (usually	
>10	 ×	 normal)	 in	 IMNM.	 As	 mentioned,	 IMNM	 can	 be	 associated	
with	anti-HMGCR	or	anti-SRP	antibodies.	EMG	often	shows	increased	
insertional	 and	 spontaneous	 activity,	 including	 myotonic	 discharges.	
Skeletal	muscle	imaging	findings	are	nonspecifically	abnormal.

Histopathology and Pathogenesis  Muscle	biopsies	reveal	multi-
focal	necrotic	and	regenerating	muscle	fibers	with	a	paucity	of	inflam-
matory	cells	(Fig. 365-5).	However,	some	patients	with	anti-HMGCR	
myopathy	have	endomysial,	macrophage-predominant	infiltrates	sim-
ilar	to	what	is	seen	in	PM.	Overexpression	of	MHC-I	and	membrane	
attack	complex	(MAC)	may	be	evident	on	sarcolemma	of	nonnecrotic	
fibers	and	MAC	deposition	on	capillaries.	The	pathogenesis	of	IMNM	
is	not	completely	understood	but	may	be	complement	mediated.

Prognosis 
IMNM	 is	 generally	 much	 more	 difficult	 to	 treat	 than	
either	DM	or	PM,	and	aggressive	immunotherapy	is	usually	required.	
The	progressive	course	despite	immunotherapy	and	marked	weakness	
with	atrophy	can	lead	to	a	misdiagnosis	of	a	limb	girdle	muscular	dys-
trophy.	There	may	be	an	increased	incidence	of	cancer	in	patients	with	
anti-HMGCR	myopathy;	thus,	patients	should	undergo	a	malignancy	
workup.
 ■ ANTISYNTHETASE SYNDROME
Clinical  Features  The	 presence	 of	 myositis,	 nonerosive	 arthritis,	
ILD,	 Raynaud’s	 phenomenon,	 mechanic	 hands,	 and	 fever	 associated	
with	antibodies	against	aminoacyl-tRNA	synthetase	constitute	the	AS.	
Some	patients	have	an	erythematous	rash,	and	muscle	biopsies	share	

FIGURE  365-5  Pathology  of  immune-mediated  necrotizing  myopathy.  Muscle 
biopsy demonstrates scattered necrotic fibers with inflammatory infiltrate confined 
to those fibers undergoing myophagocytosis along with a few regenerating fibers.

histopathologic	 features	 of	 DM,	 which	 likely	 accounts	 for	 many	 of	
these	patients	being	classified	as	having	DM.

Laboratory  Features  Antibodies	 against	 aminoacyl-tRNA	 syn-
thetases	 are	 the	 most	 common	 MSA,	 present	 in	 25–35%	 of	 patients	
with	 myositis.	 The	 most	 common	 aminoacyl-tRNA	 synthetase	 anti-
body	is	anti-Jo-1.	CK	is	usually	elevated	in	patients	with	AS	and	myo-
sitis.	 Those	 with	 ILD	 demonstrate	 reduced	 forced	 vital	 capacity	 and	
diffusion	capacity	on	pulmonary	function	tests.	Spiral	chest	CT	scans	
are	best	at	demonstrating	the	honeycomb	pattern	of	ILD.	Skeletal	mus-
cle	MRI	and	EMG	show	abnormalities	similar	to	DM,	PM,	and	IMNM.

Histopathology and Pathogenesis  Muscle	biopsies	demonstrate	
a	predilection	for	perimysial	damage	including	perimysial	fragmenta-
tion	 and	 staining	 with	 alkaline	 phosphatase	 (Fig.  365-6),	 PDCs	 and	
macrophages	in	the	perimysium	and	around	blood	vessels,	and	MAC	
deposition	 on	 capillaries.	 Also	 similar	 to	 DM,	 there	 is	 perifascicular	
muscle	fiber	damage,	but	with	AS,	there	is	more	perifascicular	muscle	
fiber	 necrosis	 compared	 to	 DM,	 in	 which	 perifascicular	 atrophy	 is	
more	prominent.	MHC-I	and	MAC	deposits	on	muscle	fibers	may	be	
seen	on	sarcolemma	of	perifascicular	muscle	fibers.

Prognosis  Most	patients	respond	to	treatment,	although	responses	
are	less	complete	than	for	DM	and	PM;	ILD	can	be	particularly	refrac-
tory	to	treatment.	Unlike	DM,	PM,	and	IMNM,	there	does	not	appear	
to	be	an	increased	risk	of	malignancy.
 ■ INCLUSION BODY MYOSITIS
Clinical Features 
IBM	usually	manifests	in	patients	over	the	age	of	
50	years	and	is	slightly	more	common	in	men	than	women.	It	is	asso-
ciated	with	slowly	progressive	weakness	and	muscle	atrophy	that	has	a	
predilection	for	early	involvement	of	the	wrist	and	finger	flexors	in	the	
arms	and	quadriceps	in	the	legs	(Fig. 365-7).	Weakness	is	often	asym-
metric.	Dysphagia	is	common	and	rarely	can	be	the	presenting	feature.	
These	clinical	features	can	help	distinguish	IBM	from	PM	and	other	
forms	of	myopathy.	The	mean	duration	from	onset	of	symptoms	to	use	
of	wheelchair	or	scooter	is	~15	years.	There	is	no	known	increased	risk	
of	malignancy.

Laboratory  Features  CK	 levels	 can	 be	 normal	 or	 only	 slightly	
elevated	 (usually	 <10	 times	 normal).	 Antibodies	 targeting	 cytosolic	
5′-nucleotidase	 1A	 (cN-1A)	 are	 detected	 in	 the	 blood	 in	 a	 third	 to	
more	than	two-thirds	of	IBM	patients	and	are	a	highly	specific	diag-
nostic	biomarker	for	IBM	among	patients	with	myopathy.	Other	blood	
biomarkers	for	IBM	include	the	presence	of	an	abnormal	population	
of	large	granular	lymphocytes	on	flow	cytometry	and	a	reduced	CD4/
CD8	 ratio	 with	 an	 increased	 CD8	 count.	 Needle	 EMG	 may	 demon-
strate	large-amplitude,	long-duration	motor	unit	potentials	that	can	be

with	rimmed	vacuoles,	cytochrome	oxi-
dase	 (COX)–negative	 fibers,	 and	 inclu-
sions	 on	 light	 or	 electron	 microscopy	
(Fig.  365-8).	 The	 inclusions	 contain	
beta-sheet	misfolded	proteins	(amyloid)	
but	 are	 difficult	 to	 appreciate	 with	 rou-
tine	 Congo	 red	 stain	 (they	 are	 seen	
on	 frozen	 but	 not	 paraffin	 sections).	
Immunostaining	 for	 p62	 appears	 to	
be	 the	 most	 sensitive	 stain	 for	 detec-
tion	 of	 these	 inclusions.	 Importantly,	
rimmed	 vacuoles	 may	 not	 be	 seen	 in	
as	 many	 as	 20–30%	 of	 muscle	 biopsies.	
In	 such	 cases,	 the	 presence	 of	 mito-
chondrial	abnormalities	(ragged	red	and	
COX-negative	fibers)	and	immunostain-
ing	 demonstrating	 p62	 inclusions	 are	
helpful	in	distinguishing	IBM	from	PM	
(aside	from	the	clinical	pattern	of	muscle	
weakness).

The	 pathogenesis	 of	 IBM	 is	 poorly	
understood.	 The	 marked	 adaptive	
immune	system	abnormalities	related	to	
T-cell	inflammation	and	the	presence	of	
a	relatively	specific	autoantibody	against	
a	 muscle	 protein	 indicate	 an	 autoim-
mune	 attack	 on	 muscle.	 The	 chronic	
and	 highly	 inflammatory	 environment	
within	muscles	in	IBM	may	alter	protein	
synthesis	 and	 degradation	 pathways	 in	
part	 via	 aberrant	 immunoproteasome	
expression.	 Additional	 histologic	 fea-
tures,	 typically	 referred	 to	 as	 “degener-
ative,”	 include	 aggregation	 of	 various	
proteins	including	markers	of	endoplasmic	reticulum	(ER)	stress	and	
autophagy	(e.g.,	p62	and	LC3).	Involvement	of	ER	stress	and	autophagy	
has	also	been	observed	in	other	autoimmune	diseases,	such	as	primary	
biliary	cholangitis	(PBC),	inflammatory	bowel	disease,	and	ankylosing	
spondylitis,	some	of	which	can	be	highly	refractory	to	immunotherapy.

Prognosis  The	myopathy	is	slowly	progressive	and	is	not	typically	
responsive	 to	 immunotherapies.	 Most	 patients	 require	 a	 scooter	 or	
wheelchair	within	10–15	years	of	onset	of	symptoms.

TREATMENT OF THE IM (TABLE 365-2)
DM,	PM,	AS,	and	IMNM	are	typically	responsive	to	immunotherapy.	
High-dose	glucocorticoids	(i.e.,	starting	dose	of	prednisone	0.75–1.0	mg/
kg	 per	 day)	 are	 considered	 the	 first-line	 treatment.	 There	 is	 uncer-
tainty	regarding	when	to	start	second-line	agents	(e.g.,	methotrexate,	
azathioprine,	 mycophenolate,	 immunoglobulin,	 or	 rituximab).	 The	
clinician	 must	 weigh	 with	 the	 patient	 the	 increased	 risks	 of	 immu-
nosuppression	 versus	 possible	 benefits	 (e.g.,	 faster	 improvement,	
steroid-sparing	effect,	and/or	avoidance	of	the	morbidities	associated	
with	 long-term	 glucocorticoid	 use).	 We	 usually	 start	 a	 second-line	
agent	 (typically	 methotrexate)	 with	 glucocorticoids	 in	 patients	 with	
severe	 weakness	 or	 other	 organ	 system	 involvement	 (e.g.,	 myocar-
ditis,	 ILD),	 those	 with	 increased	 risk	 of	 steroid	 complications	 (e.g.,	
diabetics,	osteoporosis,	or	postmenopausal	women),	and	patients	with	
IMNM	 who	 are	 known	 to	 have	 difficult-to-treat	 myositis.	 In	 those	
in	whom	we	initiate	treatment	with	prednisone	alone,	a	second-line	
agent	is	added	in	patients	who	fail	to	significantly	improve	after	2–4	
months	of	treatment	or	in	those	who	cannot	be	tapered	to	a	low	dose	
of	prednisone.

Most	 patients	 with	 IMNM	 do	 not	 respond	 to	 prednisone	 alone	
or	 even	 prednisone	 plus	 a	 second-line	 agent	 in	 combination.	 Many	
require	triple	therapy	with	prednisone,	methotrexate,	and	intravenous	
immunoglobulin	 (IVIG)	 and,	 if	 this	 fails,	 rituximab.	 Recent	 reports	
suggest	 that	 anti-HMGCR	 myopathy	 may	 respond	 to	 monotherapy	
with	IVIG,	and	a	large	multicenter	clinical	trial	to	test	this	approach	
is	underway.	Additionally,	muscle	biopsies	demonstrate	deposition	of	
membrane	 attack	 complexes	 on	 sarcolemma	 of	 nonnecrotic	 fibers	 in	
IMNM,	suggesting	that	muscle	destruction	is	complement	mediated.	
In	this	regard,	there	is	an	ongoing	international	trial	investigating	the	
safety	 and	 efficacy	 of	 a	 complement	 inhibitor	 in	 anti-HMGCR	 and	
anti-SRP	myopathies.

Unfortunately,	 IBM	 does	 not	 typically	 respond	 to	 any	 known	
immunotherapies.	 The	 mainstay	 of	 treatment	 is	 physical	 and	 occu-
pational	 therapy	 to	 improve	 function	 and	 swallowing	 therapy	 (and	
sometimes	esophageal	dilation	or	cricopharyngeal	myotomy)	in	those	
with	dysphagia.

 ■ GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR USE OF  
SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPIES
Glucocorticoids  Treatment	is	initiated	with	prednisone	(0.75–1.5	
mg/kg	up	to	100	mg)	administered	as	a	daily	morning	single	dose	(the	
most	 common	 dose	 used	 in	 adults	 is	 60	 mg	 daily).	 In	 patients	 with	
severe	 weakness	 or	 comorbidities	 (e.g.,	 ILD,	 myocarditis),	 treatment	
with	a	short	course	of	intravenous	methylprednisolone	(1	g	daily	for		
3	days)	is	recommended	prior	to	starting	oral	glucocorticoids.	Patients	
are	 generally	 maintained	 on	 high-dose	 prednisone	 until	 strength	
normalizes	 or	 until	 improvement	 in	 strength	 has	 reached	 a	 plateau	
(usually	 3–6	 months).	 Subsequently,	 prednisone	 can	 be	 tapered	 by		
5	mg	every	2–4	weeks.	Once	the	dose	is	reduced	to	20	mg	every	day	
or	every	other	day,	the	taper	is	slowed	to	2.5	mg	every	2–4	weeks.	The	
goal	 is	 to	 taper	 prednisone	 to	 ≤10	 mg	 daily.	 Although	 most	 patients	
improve,	 the	 response	 may	 not	 be	 complete	 and	 many	 will	 require	
at	 least	 a	 small	 dose	 of	 prednisone	 or	 a	 second-line	 agent	 to	 have	 a	
sustained	 remission.	 Serum	 CK	 levels	 are	 monitored;	 however,	 dose	
adjustments	of	prednisone	and	other	immunotherapies	are	primarily	
based	on	the	objective	clinical	examination	and	not	the	CK	levels	or	
the	patients’	subjective	response.	When	no	response	is	noted	after	an	
adequate	trial	of	high-dose	prednisone,	alternative	diagnoses	(e.g.,	IBM	
or	an	inflammatory	muscular	dystrophy)	and	a	repeat	muscle	biopsy	
should	be	considered.

Relapse	 of	 the	 myositis	 needs	 to	 be	 distinguished	 from	 steroid	
myopathy.	 Features	 suggesting	 a	 steroid	 myopathy	 include	 weakness	
developing	while	on	high	dosage,	a	normal	serum	CK,	clinical	features	
of	steroid	excess	such	as	ecchymoses	and	“moon	facies,”	and	absence	
of	muscle	membrane	irritability	on	EMG.	By	contrast,	patients	experi-
encing	relapse	of	myositis	may	become	weaker	during	the	prednisone	
taper,	have	increasing	serum	CK	levels,	and	display	abnormal	sponta-
neous	activity	on	EMG.

 ■ SECOND-LINE THERAPIES
Methotrexate  Methotrexate	 is	 usually	 the	 second-line	 treatment	
of	 choice	 because	 most	 authorities	 believe	 it	 works	 faster	 than	 other

agents.	An	oral	dose	of	5	or	7.5	mg/week	is	initiated	and	then	gradually	
increased	as	needed	up	to	25	mg/week.	If	there	is	no	improvement	after	
1	month	of	25	mg/week	of	oral	methotrexate,	a	switch	to	weekly	par-
enteral	(usually	subcutaneous)	methotrexate	is	the	next	step,	with	dose	
escalation	by	5	mg	weekly;	only	rarely	is	a	dose	>35	mg/week	used.	The	
major	side	effects	of	methotrexate	are	alopecia,	stomatitis,	ILD,	terato-
genicity,	oncogenicity,	risk	of	infection,	and	pulmonary	fibrosis,	along	
with	bone	marrow,	renal,	and	liver	toxicity.	Patients	are	concomitantly	
treated	with	folate	or	folinic	acid.

Azathioprine  A	 recommended	 initial	 dose	 is	 50	 mg/d	 in	 adults,	
which	can	be	increased	by	50	mg	every	2	weeks	up	to	2–3	mg/kg	per	
day.	Approximately	12%	of	patients	develop	a	systemic	reaction	char-
acterized	by	fever,	abdominal	pain,	nausea,	vomiting,	and	anorexia	that	
requires	 discontinuation	 of	 the	 drug.	 The	 major	 practical	 limitation	
of	azathioprine	is	that	6–18	months	of	treatment	are	usually	required	
before	benefit	can	be	seen.	Patients	can	be	prescreened	for	thiopurine	
methyltransferase	 (TPMT)	 deficiency	 that	 is	 associated	 with	 severe	
bone	marrow	toxicity	from	this	drug.

Mycophenolate Mofetil  This	drug	inhibits	the	proliferation	of	T	
and	B	lymphocytes	by	blocking	purine	synthesis.	It	appears	to	be	effec-
tive	in	different	forms	of	myositis	and	is	the	second-line	treatment	of	
choice	for	myositis	patients	with	ILD.	The	starting	dose	is	1.0	g	twice	
daily	and	can	be	increased	to	3	g	daily	in	divided	doses,	if	necessary.	
Mycophenolate	 is	 excreted	 through	 the	 kidneys;	 therefore,	 the	 dose	
should	be	decreased	(no	>1	g/d	total	dose)	in	patients	with	renal	insuf-
ficiency.	An	advantage	of	mycophenolate	compared	to	other	immuno-
suppressive	agents	is	the	lack	of	renal	or	hepatic	toxicity.

Intravenous Immunoglobulin 
IVIG	is	used	in	patients	refractory	
to	 prednisone	 and	 at	 least	 one	 second-line	 immunosuppressive	 agent,	
although	recent	reports	suggest	that	it	may	be	the	treatment	of	choice	
and	effective	as	a	monotherapy	in	anti-HMGCR	myopathy.	A	dose	of	2	
g/kg	is	divided	over	2–5	days,	and	repeat	infusions	are	given	at	monthly	
intervals	for	at	least	3	months.	Subsequently,	intervals	can	be	lengthened	
or	dosage	decreased:	2	g/kg	every	2	months	or	1	g/kg	per	month.

Rituximab  Rituximab	 is	 a	 monoclonal	 antibody	 directed	 against	
CD20+	B	cells.	A	large	randomized	controlled	trial	found	no	benefit,	
but	 there	 were	 flaws	 in	 the	 study	 design.	 Most	 authorities	 feel	 that	
rituximab	 can	 be	 beneficial	 in	 some	 patients	 who	 are	 refractory	 to	
prednisone	and	at	least	one	of	the	other	second-line	agents.	The	typical	
dosage	 is	 750	 mg/m2	 (up	 to	 1	 g)	 IV	 with	 a	 second	 infusion	 2	 weeks	
later	and	with	repeat	courses	(375	mg/m2	as	a	single	infusion	or	with	a	
second	infusion	2	weeks	apart)	every	6–18	months	as	needed.

MYOSITIS ASSOCIATED WITH 
CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS
Autoimmune	neurologic	complications,	including	inflammatory	neur-
opathy,	myasthenia	gravis,	and	myositis,	can	occur	with	use	of	immune	
checkpoint	 inhibitors	 (anti-CTLA-4,	 anti-PD-1,	 and	 anti-PD-L1)	 to	
treat	 various	 cancers	 (see  Chaps.  447  and  448).	 Patients	 with	 myo-
sitis	often	develop	muscle	pain	and	weakness	(axial	musculature	and	
proximal	limbs)	after	one	or	two	cycles.	Myocarditis	can	also	develop.	
Additionally,	diplopia	with	extraocular	weakness	along	with	dysphagia	
and	 dysarthria	 suggesting	 the	 co-occurrence	 of	 myasthenia	 gravis	
(MG)	may	be	present.	In	such	cases,	an	elevated	CK	level	helps	support	
the	 diagnosis	 of	 myositis,	 while	 acetylcholine	 receptor	 antibodies	 or

decremental	response	on	slow	repetitive	nerve	stimulation	can	estab-
lish	 the	 diagnosis	 of	 MG.	 Endomysial	 inflammatory	 cell	 infiltrates	
composed	of	macrophages	expressing	PD-L1	and	CD8+	lymphocytes	
expressing	PD-1,	overexpression	of	MHC-I	on	sarcolemma	of	muscle	
fibers,	and	scattered	necrotic	and	regenerating	fibers	can	be	found	on	
muscle	biopsies.

The	immune	checkpoint	inhibitor	should	be	discontinued,	but	most	
patients	 require	 concurrent	 treatment	 with	 glucocorticoids	 or	 IVIG.	
Patients	 generally	 improve	 over	 several	 months,	 during	 which	 time	
immunotherapy	 can	 be	 tapered.	 There	 are	 rare	 reports	 of	 patients	
with	mild	myositis	who	were	able	to	be	successfully	re-treated	with	an	
immune	checkpoint	inhibitor.

MYOSITIS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 
INFECTION
Early	 series	 of	 patients	 hospitalized	 with	 COVID-19	 report	 that	 as	
many	as	44%	of	patients	experienced	muscle	pain	or	fatigue	and	33%	
have	elevated	CK	levels.	Rare	cases	are	complicated	by	myoglobinuria.	
Histopathology	 can	 demonstrate	 inflammatory	 cell	 infiltration	 and	
necrotic	 muscle	 fibers.	 A	 major	 concern	 during	 this	 pandemic	 is	
whether	 or	 not	 patients	 with	 inflammatory	 myopathies	 treated	 with	
various	 immunotherapies	 are	 more	 susceptible	 to	 infection	 with	
COVID-19	 or	 at	 greater	 risk	 for	 severe	 complications.	 We	 strongly	
encourage	our	patients	to	wear	masks	and	maintain	social	distancing.

GLOBAL ISSUES
There	is	a	lack	of	epidemiologic	data	with	regard	to	the	incidence	and	
prevalence	of	various	subtypes	of	IM	throughout	the	world.	Compli-
cating	 the	 issue	 is	 disease	 awareness	 and	 the	 inability	 to	 obtain	 and	
process	 muscle	 biopsies	 and	 MSAs,	 particularly	 in	 less	 developed	
countries.	Nevertheless,	each	of	these	disorders	occurs	throughout	the	
world.	The	specific	environmental	triggers	and	genetic	risk	factors	are	
likely	 variable.	 Interestingly,	 a	 report	 from	 Japan	 found	 that	 28%	 of	
IBM	patients	had	evidence	of	exposure	to	hepatitis	C,	which	was	much	
higher	than	seen	in	the	Western	Hemisphere	and	also	more	common	
than	 seen	 in	 PM	 and	 healthy	 population	 controls	 in	 Japan.	 HIV-	
associated	 PM	 and	 IBM	 are	 more	 commonly	 encountered	 in	 areas	
endemic	 for	 HIV,	 and	 recent	 studies	 suggest	 most	 of	 these	 “PM”	
patients	turn	out	to	have	IBM	and	can	develop	symptoms	at	an	earlier	
age	 (e.g.,	 in	 the	 30s).	 Pyomyositis	 and	 parasitic	 myositis	 are	 clearly	
more	common	in	the	tropics.	The	prevalence	of	different	types	of	can-
cers	varies	in	different	parts	of	the	world,	an	important	consideration	
with	respect	to	paraneoplastic	myositis	seen	in	DM,	PM,	and	IMNM.	
For	example,	nasopharyngeal	cancer	is	particularly	common	in	Asia;	
thus,	 assessment	 for	 this	 type	 of	 cancer	 should	 be	 considered	 in	 the	
workup	of	patients	from	high-risk	regions.

366 Relapsing Polychondritis

Carol A. Langford

Relapsing	polychondritis	is	an	uncommon	disorder	of	unknown	cause	
characterized	 by	 inflammation	 of	 cartilage	 predominantly	 affecting	
the	ears,	nose,	and	laryngotracheobronchial	tree.	Multisystem	disease	
occurs	 commonly	 and	 can	 also	 involve	 noncartilaginous	 tissues	 and	
organs.	Relapsing	polychondritis	has	been	estimated	to	have	an	annual	
incidence	of	3.5	per	million.	The	peak	age	of	onset	is	between	40	and	
50	years,	but	the	disease	can	be	seen	in	all	ages	with	both	sexes	being	
equally	 affected.	 Approximately	 30%	 of	 patients	 with	 relapsing	 poly-
chondritis	will	have	another	rheumatologic	disorder,	most	frequently	
systemic	vasculitis,	rheumatoid	arthritis,	or	systemic	lupus	erythema-
tosus	 (SLE).	 Nonrheumatic	 disorders	 have	 also	 been	 associated	 with	
relapsing	polychondritis	(Table 366-1).	In	most	cases,	these	disorders	
antedate	the	appearance	of	relapsing	polychondritis,	usually	by	months	
or	years;	however,	in	other	instances,	the	onset	of	relapsing	polychon-
dritis	can	accompany	disease	presentation.
 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The	earliest	abnormality	of	hyaline	and	elastic	cartilage	noted	histolog-
ically	is	a	focal	or	diffuse	loss	of	basophilic	staining	indicating	deple-
tion	of	proteoglycan	from	the	cartilage	matrix.	Inflammatory	infiltrates	
are	 found	 adjacent	 to	 involved	 cartilage	 and	 consist	 predominantly	
of	 mononuclear	 cells	 and	 occasional	 plasma	 cells.	 In	 acute	 disease,

polymorphonuclear	 white	 cells	 may	 also	 be	 present.	 Destruction	 of	
cartilage	 begins	 at	 the	 outer	 edges	 and	 advances	 centrally.	 There	 is	
lacunar	 breakdown	 and	 loss	 of	 chondrocytes.	 Degenerating	 cartilage	
is	replaced	by	granulation	tissue	and	later	by	fibrosis	and	focal	areas	
of	 calcification.	 Small	 loci	 of	 cartilage	 regeneration	 may	 be	 present.	
Extracellular	granular	material	observed	in	the	degenerating	cartilage	
matrix	 by	 electron	 microscopy	 has	 been	 interpreted	 to	 be	 enzymes,	
immunoglobulins,	or	proteoglycans.

The	 available	 data	 suggest	 that	 both	 humoral	 and	 cell-mediated	
immunity	 play	 an	 important	 role	 in	 the	 pathogenesis	 of	 relapsing	
polychondritis.	Immunoglobulin	and	complement	deposits	are	found	
at	sites	of	inflammation.	In	addition,	antibodies	to	type	II	collagen	and	
to	matrilin-1	and	immune	complexes	are	detected	in	the	sera	of	some	
patients.	The	possibility	that	an	immune	response	to	type	II	collagen	
may	be	important	in	the	pathogenesis	is	supported	experimentally	by	
the	occurrence	of	auricular	chondritis	in	rats	immunized	with	type	II	
collagen.	Antibodies	to	type	II	collagen	are	found	in	the	sera	of	these	
animals,	 and	 immune	 deposits	 are	 detected	 at	 sites	 of	 ear	 inflamma-
tion.	 Humoral	 immune	 responses	 to	 type	 IX	 and	 type	 XI	 collagen,		
matrilin-1,	and	cartilage	oligomeric	matrix	protein	have	been	demon-
strated	in	some	patients.	Matrilin-1	is	a	noncollagenous	protein	present	
in	the	extracellular	matrix	in	cartilage.	It	is	present	in	high	concentra-
tions	in	the	trachea	and	is	also	present	in	the	nasal	septum	but	not	in	
articular	cartilage.	In	one	study,	rats	immunized	with	matrilin-1	were	
found	 to	 develop	 severe	 inspiratory	 stridor	 and	 swelling	 of	 the	 nasal	
septum	 but	 without	 involvement	 of	 the	 joint	 or	 ear	 cartilage.	 The	
rats	had	severe	inflammation	with	erosions	of	the	involved	cartilage,	
which	was	characterized	by	increased	numbers	of	CD4+	and	CD8+	T	
cells	in	the	lesions,	and	all	had	IgG	antibodies	to	matrilin-1.	A	subse-
quent	 study	 demonstrated	 serum	 anti-matrilin-1	 antibodies	 in	 ~13%	
of	patients	with	relapsing	polychondritis;	~70%	of	these	patients	had	
respiratory	 symptoms.	 Cell-mediated	 immunity	 may	 also	 be	 opera-
tive	in	causing	tissue	injury,	since	lymphocyte	transformation	can	be	
demonstrated	 when	 lymphocytes	 of	 patients	 are	 exposed	 to	 cartilage	
extracts.	T	cells	specific	for	type	II	collagen	have	been	found	in	some	
patients,	 and	 CD4+	 T	 cells	 have	 been	 observed	 at	 sites	 of	 cartilage	
inflammation.	 Genetic	 background	 may	 also	 play	 a	 role	 in	 disease	
development.	A	significantly	higher	frequency	of	HLA-DR4	has	been	
found	in	patients	with	relapsing	polychondritis	than	in	healthy	individ-
uals,	although	a	predominant	subtype	allele(s)	was	not	found.

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The	 onset	 of	 relapsing	 polychondritis	 is	 frequently	 abrupt,	 with	 the	
appearance	of	one	or	two	sites	of	cartilaginous	inflammation.	The	pat-
tern	of	cartilaginous	involvement	and	the	frequency	of	episodes	vary	
widely	among	patients.	Noncartilaginous	presentations	may	also	occur.	
Systemic	inflammatory	features	such	as	fever,	fatigue,	and	weight	loss	
commonly	 occur	 and	 may	 precede	 other	 clinical	 signs.	 Relapsing	
polychondritis	may	go	unrecognized	for	several	months	or	even	years	
in	 patients	 who	 only	 initially	 manifest	 intermittent	 joint	 pain	 and/or	
swelling	or	who	have	unexplained	eye	inflammation,	hearing	loss,	val-
vular	heart	disease,	or	pulmonary	symptoms.	Recent	studies	have	sug-
gested	that	relapsing	polychondritis	may	present	in	different	subgroups	
that	 vary	 in	 time	 to	 diagnosis,	 clinical	 and	 radiologic	 characteristics,	
and	disease-related	complications.	Although	further	investigation	will	
be	necessary	to	determine	how	these	subgroups	may	impact	treatment	
and	 outcome,	 recognition	 of	 disease	 patterns	 beyond	 cartilaginous	
involvement	may	facilitate	diagnosis.

Auricular	chondritis	is	the	most	frequent	presenting	manifestation	
of	 relapsing	 polychondritis,	 occurring	 in	 40%	 of	 patients	 and	 even-
tually	affecting	~85%	of	patients	(Table 366-2).	One	or	both	ears	are	
involved,	 either	 sequentially	 or	 simultaneously.	 Patients	 experience	
the	sudden	onset	of	pain,	tenderness,	and	swelling	of	the	cartilaginous	
portion	of	the	ear.	This	typically	involves	the	pinna	of	the	ears,	sparing	
the	earlobes	because	they	do	not	contain	cartilage.	The	overlying	skin	
has	 a	 beefy	 red	 or	 violaceous	 color.	 Prolonged	 or	 recurrent	 episodes	
lead	to	cartilage	destruction	and	result	in	a	droopy	ear.	Swelling	may	
close	off	the	eustachian	tube	or	the	external	auditory	meatus,	either	of

which	can	impair	hearing.	Inflammation	of	the	internal	auditory	artery	
or	 its	 cochlear	 branch	 produces	 hearing	 loss,	 vertigo,	 ataxia,	 nausea,	
and	vomiting.	Vertigo	is	almost	always	accompanied	by	hearing	loss.

Approximately	61%	of	patients	will	develop	nasal	involvement,	with	
21%	 having	 this	 at	 the	 time	 of	 presentation.	 Patients	 may	 experience	
nasal	congestion,	rhinorrhea,	and	epistaxis.	The	bridge	of	the	nose	and	
surrounding	tissue	become	red,	swollen,	and	tender	and	may	collapse,	
producing	a	saddle	nose	deformity	(Fig. 366-1).	In	some	patients,	nasal	
deformity	develops	insidiously	without	overt	inflammation.	Saddle	nose	
is	observed	more	frequently	in	younger	patients,	especially	in	women.

with	inflamed	cartilage)	in	which	patients	present	with	features	of	both	
relapsing	polychondritis	and	Behçet’s	disease	(Chap. 364).

Relapsing	polychondritis	has	also	been	found	to	be	associated	with	
VEXAS	syndrome	(vacuoles,	E1	enzyme,	X-linked,	autoinflammatory,	
somatic).	 VEXAS	 syndrome	 should	 be	 considered	 in	 male	 patients	
with	 relapsing	 polychondritis	 who	 have	 hematologic	 abnormalities	
often	 in	 the	 spectrum	 of	 myelodysplastic	 syndrome,	 fevers,	 venous	
thrombotic	events,	pulmonary	infiltrates,	cutaneous	lesions,	or	treat-
ment	 resistant	 disease.	 VEXAS	 syndrome	 is	 strongly	 suggested	 by	
its	 clinical	 features	 and	 the	 finding	 of	 vacuoles	 within	 bone	 marrow	
precursor	 cells.	 It	 is	 proven	 by	 genetic	 testing	 for	 myeloid-restricted	
somatic	missense	mutations	in	UBA1,	the	major	E1	enzyme	that	ini-
tiates	ubiquitylation.

 ■ LABORATORY FINDINGS AND  
DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING
There	 are	 no	 laboratory	 features	 that	 are	 diagnostic	 for	 relapsing	
polychondritis.	 Mild	 leukocytosis	 and	 normocytic,	 normochromic	
anemia	are	often	present.	Eosinophilia	is	observed	in	10%	of	patients.	
The	 erythrocyte	 sedimentation	 rate	 and	 C-reactive	 protein	 are	 usu-
ally	 elevated.	 Rheumatoid	 factor	 and	 antinuclear	 antibody	 tests	 are	
occasionally	positive	in	low	titers,	and	complement	levels	are	normal.	
Antibodies	 to	 type	 II	 collagen	 are	 present	 in	 fewer	 than	 one-half	 of	
patients	and	are	not	specific.	Circulating	immune	complexes	may	be	
detected,	especially	in	patients	with	early	active	disease.	Elevated	levels	
of	 γ	 globulin	 may	 be	 present.	 Antineutrophil	 cytoplasmic	 antibodies	
(ANCA),	 either	 cytoplasmic	 (cANCA)	 or	 perinuclear	 (pANCA),	
are	 found	 in	 some	 patients	 with	 active	 disease.	 However,	 on	 target		
antigen–specific	 testing,	 there	 are	 only	 occasional	 reports	 of	 positive	
myeloperoxidase-ANCA,	 and	 proteinase	 3-ANCA	 are	 very	 rarely	
found	in	relapsing	polychondritis.

The	upper	and	lower	airways	can	be	evaluated	by	imaging	tech-
niques	such	as	computed	tomography	(CT)	and	magnetic	resonance	
(MR).	Dynamic	inspiratory	and	expiratory	CT	imaging	can	be	useful	
in	assessing	airway	involvement.	Bronchoscopy	provides	direct	visu-
alization	of	the	airways	but	can	be	a	high-risk	procedure	in	patients	
with	 airway	 compromise.	 Pulmonary	 function	 testing	 with	 flow-	
volume	loops	can	show	inspiratory	and/or	expiratory	obstruction.

Imaging	 can	 also	 be	 useful	 to	 detect	 extracartilaginous	 disease.	
Arteriography	by	CT	or	MR	should	be	pursued	if	features	are	pres-
ent	suggesting	aortic	or	other	large	vessel	involvement.	Electrocar-
diography	and	echocardiography	can	be	useful	in	further	evaluating	
for	cardiac	features	of	disease.	A	number	of	reports	have	described	
the	use	of	positron	emission	tomography	in	relapsing	polychondri-
tis,	but	it	is	currently	unclear	if	this	is	useful	and	for	what	features.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis	is	based	on	recognition	of	the	typical	clinical	features.	Biop-
sies	of	the	involved	cartilage	from	the	ear,	nose,	or	respiratory	tract	can	
confirm	 the	 diagnosis	 but	 are	 only	 necessary	 when	 clinical	 features	
are	not	typical	and	may	be	difficult	to	obtain.	Diagnostic	criteria	were	
suggested	 in	 1976	 by	 McAdam	 et	 al	 and	 included	 biopsy	 evidence	
combined	with	three	of	the	following:	(1)	recurrent	chondritis	of	both	
auricles;	(2)	nonerosive	inflammatory	arthritis;	(3)	chondritis	of	nasal	
cartilage;	 (4)	 inflammation	 of	 ocular	 structures,	 including	 conjuncti-
vitis,	keratitis,	scleritis/episcleritis,	and/or	uveitis;	(5)	chondritis	of	the	
laryngeal	and/or	tracheal	cartilages;	and	(6)	cochlear	and/or	vestibular	
damage	manifested	by	neurosensory	hearing	loss,	tinnitus,	and/or	ver-
tigo.	In	1979,	Damiani	and	Levine	suggested	that	the	diagnosis	could	
be	made	when	one	or	more	of	the	above	features	and	a	positive	biopsy	
were	present,	when	two	or	more	separate	sites	of	cartilage	inflamma-
tion	were	present	that	responded	to	treatment,	or	when	three	or	more	
of	the	above	features	were	present.

The	 differential	 diagnosis	 of	 relapsing	 polychondritis	 is	 centered	
around	its	sites	of	clinical	involvement.	Patients	with	granulomatosis	
with	 polyangiitis	 may	 have	 a	 saddle	 nose	 and	 tracheal	 involvement	
but	 can	 be	 distinguished	 by	 the	 primary	 inflammation	 occurring	
in	 the	 mucosa	 at	 these	 sites,	 the	 absence	 of	 auricular	 involvement,	
and	 the	 presence	 of	 pulmonary	 parenchymal	 disease.	 Patients	 with	

FIGURE 366-2  Narrowing of the subglottis occurring as a result of laryngotracheal 
involvement in relapsing polychondritis. (Image courtesy of Marcela Ferrada, MD)

is	usually	asymmetric	and	oligo-	or	polyarticular,	and	it	involves	both	
large	and	small	peripheral	joints.	An	episode	of	arthritis	lasts	from	a	
few	 days	 to	 several	 weeks	 and	 resolves	 spontaneously	 without	 joint	
erosion	or	deformity.	Attacks	of	arthritis	may	not	be	temporally	related	
to	 other	 manifestations	 of	 relapsing	 polychondritis.	 Joint	 fluid	 has	
been	reported	to	be	noninflammatory.	In	addition	to	peripheral	joints,	
inflammation	 may	 involve	 the	 costochondral,	 sternomanubrial,	 and	
sternoclavicular	cartilages.	Destruction	of	these	cartilages	may	result	in	
a	pectus	excavatum	deformity	or	even	a	flail	anterior	chest	wall.

Eye	 manifestations	 occur	 in	 more	 than	 one-half	 of	 patients	 and	
include	 conjunctivitis,	 episcleritis,	 scleritis,	 iritis,	 uveitis,	 and	 keratitis.	
Ocular	inflammation	can	be	severe	and	visually	threatening.	Other	man-
ifestations	include	eyelid	and	periorbital	edema,	proptosis,	optic	neuritis,	
extraocular	muscle	palsies,	retinal	vasculitis,	and	renal	vein	occlusion.

Laryngotracheobronchial	 involvement	 occurs	 in	 ~50%	 of	 patients	
and	is	among	the	most	serious	manifestations	of	relapsing	polychon-
dritis  (Fig.  366-2).	 Symptoms	 include	 hoarseness,	 a	 nonproductive	
cough,	and	tenderness	over	the	larynx	and	proximal	trachea.	Mucosal	
edema,	 strictures,	 and/or	 collapse	 of	 laryngeal	 or	 tracheal	 cartilage	
may	cause	stridor	and	life-threatening	airway	obstruction	necessitating	
tracheostomy.	Involvement	can	extend	into	the	lower	airways	resulting	
in	 tracheobronchomalacia.	 Collapse	 of	 cartilage	 in	 bronchi	 leads	 to	
pneumonia	and,	when	extensive,	to	respiratory	insufficiency.

Cardiac	valvular	regurgitation	occurs	in	~5–10%	of	patients	and	is	
due	to	progressive	dilation	of	the	valvular	ring	or	to	destruction	of	the	
valve	 cusps.	 Aortic	 regurgitation	 occurs	 in	 ~7%	 of	 patients,	 with	 the	
mitral	and	other	heart	valves	being	affected	less	often.	Other	cardiac	
manifestations	 include	 pericarditis,	 myocarditis,	 coronary	 vasculitis,	
and	 conduction	 abnormalities.	 Aneurysms	 of	 the	 proximal,	 thoracic,	
or	abdominal	aorta	may	occur	even	in	the	absence	of	active	chondritis	
and	occasionally	rupture.

Renal	disease	occurs	in	~10%	of	patients.	The	most	common	renal	
lesions	 include	 mesangial	 expansion	 or	 segmental	 necrotizing	 glo-
merulonephritis,	 which	 often	 have	 small	 amounts	 of	 electron-dense	
deposits	in	the	mesangium	where	there	is	also	faint	deposition	of	C3	
and/or	 IgG	 or	 IgM.	 Tubulointerstitial	 disease	 and	 IgA	 nephropathy	
have	also	been	reported.

Approximately	25%	of	patients	have	skin	lesions,	which	can	include	
purpura,	 erythema	 nodosum,	 erythema	 multiforme,	 angioedema/	
urticaria,	livedo	reticularis,	and	panniculitis.

Features	of	vasculitis	are	seen	in	up	to	25%	of	patients	and	can	affect	
any	size	vessel.	Large	vessel	vasculitis	may	present	with	aortic	aneurysms,	
and	medium	vessel	disease	may	affect	the	coronary,	hepatic,	mesenteric,	
or	 renal	 arteries	 or	 vessel-supplying	 nerves.	 Cutaneous	 vasculitis	 can	
also	 occur.	 A	 variety	 of	 primary	 vasculitides	 have	 also	 been	 reported	
to	occur	in	association	with	relapsing	polychondritis	(Chap. 363).	One	
specific	 overlap	 is	 the	 “MAGIC”	 syndrome	 (mouth	 and	 genital	 ulcers

Cogan’s	 syndrome	 have	 interstitial	 keratitis	 and	 vestibular	 and	
auditory	 abnormalities,	 but	 this	 syndrome	 does	 not	 involve	 the	
respiratory	 tract	 or	 ears.	 Reactive	 arthritis	 may	 initially	 resemble	
relapsing	 polychondritis	 because	 of	 oligoarticular	 arthritis	 and	 eye	
involvement,	 but	 it	 is	 distinguished	 by	 the	 occurrence	 of	 urethritis	
and	 typical	 mucocutaneous	 lesions	 and	 the	 absence	 of	 nose	 or	 ear	
cartilage	 involvement.	 Rheumatoid	 arthritis	 may	 initially	 suggest	
relapsing	 polychondritis	 because	 of	 arthritis	 and	 eye	 inflammation,	
although	the	arthritis	is	erosive	and	symmetric.	In	addition,	rheuma-
toid	 factor	 titers	 are	 usually	 high	 compared	 with	 those	 in	 relapsing	
polychondritis,	 and	 anti-cyclic	 citrullinated	 peptide	 is	 usually	 not	
seen.	Bacterial	infection	of	the	pinna	may	be	mistaken	for	relapsing	
polychondritis	but	differs	by	usually	involving	only	one	ear,	including	
the	 earlobe.	 Auricular	 cartilage	 may	 also	 be	 damaged	 by	 trauma	 or	
frostbite.	 Nasal	 destructive	 disease	 and	 auricular	 abnormalities	 can	
also	 be	 seen	 in	 patients	 using	 cocaine	 adulterated	 with	 levamisole.	
Ear	involvement	in	this	setting	differs	from	relapsing	polychondritis	
by	typically	manifesting	as	purpuric	plaques	with	necrosis	extending	
to	the	earlobe,	which	does	not	contain	cartilage.

TREATMENT
Relapsing Polychondritis

In	patients	with	active	chondritis,	prednisone,	40–60	mg/d,	is	often	
effective	in	suppressing	disease	activity;	it	is	tapered	gradually	once	
disease	is	controlled.	In	some	patients,	prednisone	can	be	stopped,	
whereas	in	others,	low	doses	in	the	range	of	5–10	mg/d	are	required	
for	 continued	 suppression	 of	 disease.	 Other	 immunosuppressive	
drugs	 such	 as	 cyclophosphamide,	 methotrexate,	 azathioprine,	
mycophenolate	mofetil,	or	cyclosporine	should	be	used	in	patients	
who	 have	 severe	 organ-threatening	 disease,	 fail	 to	 respond	 to	
prednisone,	or	require	high	doses	to	control	disease	activity.	There	
has	 been	 significant	 interest	 in	 the	 use	 of	 biologic	 agents	 to	 treat	
relapsing	 polychondritis.	 Tumor	 necrosis	 factor	 inhibitors	 have	
been	 the	 most	 widely	 examined	 therapies	 to	 date,	 and	 although	
benefit	has	been	suggested,	this	has	come	solely	from	retrospective	
cases	and	series.	Other	agents	with	which	there	have	been	published	
reports	include	anakinra,	rituximab,	tocilizumab,	and	abatacept,	but	
reports	are	too	few	in	number	to	assess	efficacy.	Dapsone	has	also	
been	 used	 in	 selected	 settings	 but	 has	 largely	 been	 supplanted	 by	
other	approaches	and	should	not	be	used	for	severe	disease.	Heart	
valve	replacement	or	repair	of	an	aortic	aneurysm	may	be	necessary.	
When	airway	obstruction	is	severe,	tracheostomy	is	required.	Stents	
may	be	necessary	in	patients	with	tracheobronchial	collapse.

 ■ PATIENT OUTCOME, PROGNOSIS, AND SURVIVAL
The	course	of	relapsing	polychondritis	is	highly	variable.	Some	patients	
experience	 inflammatory	 episodes	 lasting	 from	 a	 few	 days	 to	 several	
weeks	that	then	subside	spontaneously	or	with	treatment.	Attacks	may	
recur	 at	 intervals	 varying	 from	 weeks	 to	 months.	 In	 other	 patients,	
the	 disease	 has	 a	 chronic,	 smoldering	 course	 that	 may	 be	 severe.	 In	
one	study,	the	5-year	estimated	survival	rate	was	74%,	and	the	10-year	
survival	rate	was	55%.	About	one-half	of	the	deaths	could	be	attributed	
to	 relapsing	 polychondritis	 or	 complications	 of	 treatment.	 Airway	
complications	accounted	for	10%	of	all	fatalities,	although	higher	rates	
have	been	reported	in	other	series.	In	general,	patients	with	more	wide-
spread	disease	have	a	worse	prognosis.

367 Sarcoidosis

Robert P. Baughman, Elyse E. Lower

DEFINITION
Sarcoidosis	is	an	inflammatory	disease	characterized	by	the	presence	
of	 noncaseating	 granulomas.	 The	 disease	 is	 often	 multisystemic	 and	
requires	 the	 presence	 of	 involvement	 in	 two	 or	 more	 organs	 for	 a	
specific	diagnosis.	The	finding	of	granulomas	is	not	specific	for	sarcoi-
dosis,	and	other	conditions	known	to	cause	granulomas	must	be	ruled	
out.	 These	 conditions	 include	 mycobacterial	 and	 fungal	 infections,	
malignancy,	 and	 environmental	 agents	 such	 as	 beryllium.	 Although	
sarcoidosis	 can	 affect	 virtually	 every	 organ	 of	 the	 body,	 the	 lung	 is	
most	 commonly	 affected.	 Other	 organs	 commonly	 affected	 are	 the	
liver,	 skin,	 and	 eye.	 The	 clinical	 outcome	 of	 sarcoidosis	 varies,	 with	
remission	occurring	in	over	one-half	of	patients	within	a	few	years	of	
diagnosis;	 however,	 the	 remaining	 patients	 may	 develop	 chronic	 dis-
ease	that	lasts	for	decades.

ETIOLOGY
Despite	 multiple	 investigations,	 the	 cause	 of	 sarcoidosis	 remains	
unknown.	Currently,	the	most	likely	etiology	is	an	infectious	or	non-
infectious	environmental	agent	that	triggers	an	inflammatory	response	
in	a	genetically	susceptible	host.	Among	the	possible	infectious	agents,	
careful	 studies	 have	 shown	 a	 much	 higher	 incidence	 of	 Propionibac-
terium  acnes	 in	 the	 lymph	 nodes	 of	 sarcoidosis	 patients	 compared	
to	 controls.	 An	 animal	 model	 has	 shown	 that	 P.  acnes	 can	 induce	 a	
granulomatous	 response	 in	 mice	 similar	 to	 sarcoidosis.	 Others	 have	
demonstrated	the	presence	of	a	mycobacterial	protein	(Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis	catalase-peroxidase	[mKatG])	in	the	granulomas	of	some	
sarcoidosis	patients.	This	protein	is	very	resistant	to	degradation	and	
may	represent	the	persistent	antigen	in	sarcoidosis.	Immune	response	
to	 this	 and	 other	 mycobacterial	 proteins	 has	 been	 documented	 by	
another	laboratory.	These	studies	suggest	that	a	Mycobacterium	similar	
to	 M.  tuberculosis	 could	 be	 responsible	 for	 sarcoidosis.	 The	 mecha-
nism	exposure/infection	with	such	agents	has	been	the	focus	of	other	
studies.	Environmental	exposures	to	insecticides	and	mold	have	been	
associated	with	an	increased	risk	for	disease.	In	addition,	health	care	
workers	appear	to	have	an	increased	risk.	Also,	sarcoidosis	in	a	donor	
organ	 has	 occurred	 after	 transplantation	 into	 a	 sarcoidosis	 patient.	
Some	 authors	 have	 suggested	 that	 sarcoidosis	 is	 not	 due	 to	 a	 single	
agent	 but	 represents	 a	 particular	 host	 response	 to	 multiple	 agents.	
Some	studies	have	been	able	to	correlate	environmental	exposures	to	
genetic	 markers.	 These	 studies	 have	 supported	 the	 hypothesis	 that	 a	
genetically	susceptible	host	is	a	key	factor	in	the	disease.

 ■ INCIDENCE, PREVALENCE, AND GLOBAL IMPACT
Sarcoidosis	 is	 seen	 worldwide,	 with	 the	 highest	 prevalence	 reported	
in	 the	 Nordic	 population.	 In	 the	 United	 States,	 the	 disease	 has	 been	
reported	 more	 commonly	 in	 African	 Americans	 than	 whites,	 with	
the	 ratio	 of	 African	 Americans	 to	 whites	 ranging	 from	 3:1	 to	 17:0.	
In	 the	 United	 States,	 women	 are	 more	 susceptible	 than	 men.	 The	
higher	incidence	in	African	Americans	may	have	been	influenced	by	
the	fact	that	African	Americans	seem	to	develop	more	extensive	and	
chronic	 pulmonary	 disease.	 Because	 most	 sarcoidosis	 clinics	 are	 run	

HPIM21e_Part11_p2671-p2880.indd   2829

2830 by	 pulmonologists,	 a	 selection	 bias	 may	 have	 occurred.	 Worldwide,	
the	prevalence	of	the	disease	varies	from	20–60	per	100,000	for	many	
groups	such	as	Japanese,	Italians,	and	American	whites.	Higher	rates	
occur	in	Ireland	and	Nordic	countries.	In	one	closely	observed	com-
munity	in	Sweden,	the	lifetime	risk	for	developing	sarcoidosis	was	3%.
Sarcoidosis	 often	 occurs	 in	 young,	 otherwise	 healthy	 adults.	 It	 is	
uncommon	to	diagnose	the	disease	in	someone	aged	<18	years.	How-
ever,	 it	 has	 become	 clear	 that	 a	 second	 peak	 in	 incidence	 develops	
around	age	60.	In	a	study	of	nearly	30,000	sarcoidosis	patients	in	the	
United	States,	the	median	age	at	diagnosis	was	55.

Although	most	cases	of	sarcoidosis	are	sporadic,	a	familial	form	of	the	
disease	exists.	At	least	5%	of	patients	with	sarcoidosis	will	have	a	family	
member	with	sarcoidosis.	Sarcoidosis	patients	who	are	Irish	or	African	
American	seem	to	have	a	two	to	three	times	higher	rate	of	familial	disease.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND 
IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS
The	 granuloma	 is	 the	 pathologic	 hallmark	 of	 sarcoidosis.	 A	 dis-
tinct	 feature	 of	 sarcoidosis	 is	 the	 local	 accumulation	 of	 inflamma-
tory	 cells.	 Extensive	 studies	 in	 the	 lung	 using	 bronchoalveolar	 lavage	
(BAL)	 have	 demonstrated	 that	 the	 initial	 inflammatory	 response	 is	 an	
influx	 of	 T	 helper	 cells.	 In	 addition,	 there	 is	 an	 accumulation	 of	 acti-
vated	 monocytes.	 Figure  367-1	 is	 a	 proposed	 model	 for	 sarcoidosis.		
Using	 the	 HLA-CD4	 complex,	 antigen-presenting	 cells	 present	 an	
unknown	antigen	to	the	helper	T	cell.	Studies	have	clarified	that	specific	
human	leukocyte	antigen	(HLA)	haplotypes	such	as	HLA-DRB1*1101	are	
associated	with	an	increased	risk	for	developing	sarcoidosis.	In	addition,	
different	HLA	haplotypes	are	associated	with	different	clinical	outcomes.
The	 macrophage/helper	 T-cell	 cluster	 leads	 to	 activation	 with	 the	
increased	 release	 of	 several	 cytokines.	 These	 include	 interleukin	 (IL)

initial	inflammatory	response.	In	advanced,	untreated	HIV	infection,

pulmonary	 sarcoidosis	 with	 cyclosporine,	 a	 drug	 that	 downregulates	
helper	T-cell	responses,	seems	to	have	little	impact	on	sarcoidosis.

The	 granulomatous	 response	 of	 sarcoidosis	 can	 resolve	 with	 or	
without	therapy.	However,	in	at	least	20%	of	patients	with	sarcoidosis,	a	
chronic	form	of	the	disease	develops.	This	persistent	form	of	the	disease	
is	associated	with	increased	levels	in	blood	and/or	BAL	of	IL-8,	IL-17,	
and	CXCL9.	Also,	studies	have	reported	that	patients	with	this	chronic	
form	of	disease	release	excessive	amounts	of	TNF	in	areas	of	inflam-
mation.	Specific	gene	signatures	have	been	associated	with	more	severe	
disease,	such	as	cardiac,	neurologic,	and	fibrotic	pulmonary	disease.

At	 diagnosis,	 the	 natural	 history	 of	 the	 disease	 may	 be	 difficult	 to	
predict.	One	form	of	the	disease,	Löfgren’s syndrome,	consists	of	erythema	
nodosum	and	hilar	adenopathy	on	chest	roentgenogram.	In	some	cases,	
periarticular	 arthritis	 may	 be	 identified	 without	 erythema	 nodosum.	
Löfgren’s	 syndrome	 is	 associated	 with	 a	 good	 prognosis,	 with	 >90%	 of	
patients	 experiencing	 disease	 resolution	 within	 2	 years.	 Recent	 studies	
have	 demonstrated	 that	 the	 HLA-DRB1*03	 was	 found	 in	 two-thirds	 of	
Scandinavian	patients	with	Löfgren’s	syndrome.	More	than	95%	of	those	
patients	who	were	HLA-DRB1*03	positive	had	resolution	of	their	disease	
within	2	years,	whereas	nearly	one-half	of	the	remaining	patients	had	dis-
ease	for	>2	years.	It	remains	to	be	determined	whether	these	observations	
can	be	applied	to	a	non-Scandinavian	population.

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The	presentation	of	sarcoidosis	ranges	from	patients	who	are	asymp-
tomatic	to	those	with	organ	failure.	It	is	unclear	how	often	sarcoidosis	
is	 asymptomatic.	 In	 countries	 where	 routine	 chest	 roentgenogram	
screening	 is	 performed,	 20–30%	 of	 pulmonary	 cases	 are	 detected	 in	
asymptomatic	individuals.	The	inability	to	screen	for	other	asymptom-
atic	 forms	 of	 the	 disease	 would	 suggest	 that	 as	 many	 as	 one-third	 of	
sarcoidosis	patients	are	asymptomatic.

Respiratory	complaints	including	cough	and	dyspnea	are	the	most	
common	 presenting	 symptoms.	 In	 many	 cases,	 the	 patient	 presents	
with	a	2-	to	4-week	history	of	these	symptoms.	Unfortunately,	due	to	
the	 nonspecific	 nature	 of	 pulmonary	 symptoms,	 the	 patient	 may	 see	
physicians	for	up	to	a	year	before	a	diagnosis	is	confirmed.	For	these	
patients,	the	diagnosis	of	sarcoidosis	is	usually	only	suggested	when	a	
chest	roentgenogram	is	performed.

Symptoms	related	to	cutaneous	and	ocular	disease	are	the	next	two	
most	common	complaints.	Skin	lesions	are	often	nonspecific.	However,	
because	 these	 lesions	 are	 readily	 observed,	 the	 patient	 and	 treating	
physician	are	often	led	to	a	diagnosis.	In	contrast	to	patients	with	pul-
monary	disease,	patients	with	cutaneous	lesions	are	more	likely	to	be	
diagnosed	within	6	months	of	symptoms.

Nonspecific	 constitutional	 symptoms	 include	 fatigue,	 fever,	 night	
sweats,	and	weight	loss.	Fatigue	is	perhaps	the	most	common	constitu-
tional	symptom	that	affects	these	patients.	Given	its	insidious	nature,	
patients	are	usually	not	aware	of	the	association	with	their	sarcoidosis	
until	their	disease	resolves.

The	 overall	 incidence	 of	 sarcoidosis	 at	 the	 time	 of	 diagnosis	 and	
eventual	common	organ	involvement	are	summarized	in	Table 367-1.	
Over	 time,	 skin,	 eye,	 and	 neurologic	 involvement	 seem	 more	 appar-
ent.	In	the	United	States,	the	frequency	of	specific	organ	involvement	
appears	to	be	affected	by	age,	race,	and	gender.	For	example,	eye	disease	
is	 more	 common	 among	 African	 Americans.	 Under	 the	 age	 of	 40,	 it	
occurs	more	frequently	in	women.	However,	in	those	diagnosed	over	
the	age	of	40,	eye	disease	is	more	common	in	men.

 ■ LUNG
Lung	 involvement	 occurs	 in	 >90%	 of	 sarcoidosis	 patients.	 The	 most	
commonly	 used	 method	 for	 detecting	 lung	 disease	 is	 still	 the	 chest	
roentgenogram.	Figure 367-2	illustrates	the	chest	roentgenogram	from	
a	sarcoidosis	patient	with	bilateral	hilar	adenopathy.	Although	the	CT	
scan	has	changed	the	diagnostic	approach	to	interstitial	lung	disease,	
it	is	not	usually	considered	a	monitoring	tool	for	patients	with	sarcoi-
dosis	except	for	those	with	pulmonary	fibrosis.	Figure 367-3	demon-
strates	some	of	the	characteristic	CT	features,	including	peribronchial	
thickening	 and	 reticular	 nodular	 changes,	 which	 are	 predominantly

aPatients could have more than one organ involved. bFrom ACCESS study of 736

Sarcoidosis Clinic from 2002 to 2006.

subpleural.	The	peribronchial	thickening	seen	on	CT	seems	to	explain	
the	 high	 yield	 of	 granulomas	 from	 bronchial	 biopsies	 performed	 for	
diagnosis.

Although	the	CT	scan	is	more	sensitive,	the	standard	scoring	system	
described	by	Scadding	in	1961	for	chest	roentgenograms	remains	the	
preferred	method	of	characterizing	chest	involvement.	Stage	1	is	hilar	
adenopathy	alone	(Fig.	367-2),	often	with	right	paratracheal	involve-
ment.	Stage	2	is	a	combination	of	adenopathy	plus	infiltrates,	whereas	
stage	3	reveals	infiltrates	alone.	Stage	4	consists	of	fibrosis.	Usually	the	
infiltrates	in	sarcoidosis	are	predominantly	an	upper	lobe	process.	Only	
in	a	few	noninfectious	diseases	is	an	upper	lobe	predominance	noted.	
In	addition	to	sarcoidosis,	the	differential	diagnosis	of	upper	lobe	dis-
ease	 includes	 hypersensitivity	 pneumonitis,	 silicosis,	 and	 Langerhans	
cell	histiocytosis.	For	infectious	diseases,	tuberculosis	and	Pneumocys-
tis	pneumonia	can	often	present	as	upper	lobe	diseases.

Lung	volumes,	mechanics,	and	diffusion	are	all	useful	in	evaluating	
interstitial	 lung	 diseases	 such	 as	 sarcoidosis.	 The	 diffusion	 of	 carbon	
monoxide	(DLCO)	is	the	most	sensitive	test	for	interstitial	lung	disease.	
Reduced	 lung	 volumes	 are	 a	 reflection	 of	 the	 restrictive	 lung	 disease	
seen	 in	 sarcoidosis.	 However,	 a	 third	 of	 the	 patients	 presenting	 with	
sarcoidosis	 still	 have	 lung	 volumes	 within	 the	 normal	 range,	 despite	
abnormal	chest	roentgenograms	and	dyspnea.

Approximately	 one-half	 of	 sarcoidosis	 patients	 present	 with	
obstructive	 disease,	 reflected	 by	 a	 reduced	 ratio	 of	 forced	 expiratory	
volume	 in	 1	 s	 to	 forced	 vital	 capacity	 (FEV1/FVC).	 Cough	 is	 a	 very	
common	 symptom.	 Airway	 involvement	 causing	 varying	 degrees	 of	
obstruction	underlies	the	cough	in	most	sarcoidosis	patients.	Airway	

FIGURE  367-2  Posterior-anterior  chest  roentgenogram  demonstrating  bilateral 
hilar adenopathy, stage 1 disease. 

FIGURE 367-3  High-resolution CT scan of the chest demonstrating patchy reticular 
nodularity, including areas of confluence. 

hyperreactivity,	as	determined	by	methacholine	challenge,	will	be	pos-
itive	in	some	of	these	patients.	A	few	patients	with	cough	will	respond	
to	traditional	bronchodilators	as	the	only	form	of	treatment.	In	some	
cases,	 high-dose	 inhaled	 glucocorticoids	 alone	 are	 useful.	 Airway	
obstruction	 can	 be	 due	 to	 large	 airway	 stenosis,	 which	 can	 become	
fibrotic	and	unresponsive	to	anti-inflammatory	therapy.

Pulmonary	arterial	hypertension	is	reported	in	at	least	5%	of	sarcoi-
dosis	patients.	Either	direct	vascular	involvement	or	the	consequence	of	
fibrotic	changes	in	the	lung	can	lead	to	pulmonary	arterial	hypertension.	
In	sarcoidosis	patients	with	end-stage	fibrosis	awaiting	lung	transplant,	
70%	will	have	pulmonary	arterial	hypertension.	This	is	a	much	higher	
incidence	 than	 that	 reported	 for	 other	 fibrotic	 lung	 diseases.	 In	 less	
advanced	but	still	symptomatic	patients,	pulmonary	arterial	hyperten-
sion	has	been	noted	in	up	to	50%	of	cases.	Because	sarcoidosis-associated	
pulmonary	arterial	hypertension	may	respond	to	therapy,	evaluation	for	
this	should	be	considered	in	persistently	dyspneic	patients.

 ■ SKIN
Skin	involvement	is	eventually	identified	in	over	a	third	of	patients	with	
sarcoidosis.	The	classic	cutaneous	lesions	include	erythema	nodosum,	
maculopapular	 lesions,	 hyper-	 and	 hypopigmentation,	 keloid	 forma-
tion,	 and	 subcutaneous	 nodules.	 A	 specific	 complex	 of	 involvement	
of	the	bridge	of	the	nose,	the	area	beneath	the	eyes,	and	the	cheeks	is	
referred	to	as	lupus pernio	(Fig. 367-4)	and	is	diagnostic	for	a	chronic	
form	of	sarcoidosis.

In	contrast,	erythema	nodosum	is	a	transient	rash	that	can	be	seen	
in	association	with	hilar	adenopathy	and	uveitis	(Löfgren’s	syndrome).	
Erythema	 nodosum	 is	 more	 common	 in	 women	 and	 in	 certain	 self-
described	demographic	groups	including	whites	and	Puerto	Ricans.	In	
the	United	States,	the	other	manifestations	of	skin	sarcoidosis,	especially	
lupus	pernio,	are	more	common	in	African	Americans	than	whites.

The	maculopapular	lesions	from	sarcoidosis	are	the	most	common	
chronic	form	of	the	disease	(Fig. 367-5).	These	are	often	overlooked	
by	 the	 patient	 and	 physician	 because	 they	 are	 chronic	 and	 not	 pain-
ful.	 Initially,	 these	 lesions	 are	 usually	 purplish	 papules	 and	 are	 often	
indurated.	 They	 can	 become	 confluent	 and	 infiltrate	 large	 areas	 of	
the	skin.	With	treatment,	the	color	and	induration	may	fade.	Because	
these	lesions	are	caused	by	noncaseating	granulomas,	the	diagnosis	of	
sarcoidosis	can	be	readily	made	by	a	skin	biopsy.

 ■ EYE
The	frequency	of	ocular	manifestations	for	sarcoidosis	varies	depend-
ing	 on	 race.	 In	 Japan,	 >70%	 of	 sarcoidosis	 patients	 develop	 ocular	
disease,	whereas	in	the	United	States,	only	30%	have	eye	disease,	with

is	 an	 elevation	 of	 the	 alkaline	 phosphatase	 level,	 consistent	 with	 an	
obstructive	 pattern.	 In	 addition,	 elevated	 transaminase	 levels	 can	
occur.	An	elevated	bilirubin	level	is	a	marker	for	more	advanced	liver	
disease.	Overall,	only	5%	of	sarcoidosis	patients	have	sufficient	symp-
toms	 from	 their	 liver	 disease	 to	 require	 specific	 therapy.	 Although	
symptoms	 can	 be	 due	 to	 hepatomegaly,	 more	 frequently	 symptoms	
result	from	extensive	intrahepatic	cholestasis	leading	to	portal	hyper-
tension.	In	this	case,	ascites	and	esophageal	varices	can	occur.	It	is	rare	
that	 a	 sarcoidosis	 patient	 will	 require	 a	 liver	 transplant	 because	 even	
the	patient	with	cirrhosis	due	to	sarcoidosis	can	respond	to	systemic	
therapy.

 ■ BONE MARROW AND SPLEEN
One	or	more	bone	marrow	manifestations	can	be	identified	in	many	
sarcoidosis	patients.	The	most	common	hematologic	problem	is	lym-
phopenia,	 which	 is	 a	 reflection	 of	 sequestration	 of	 the	 lymphocytes	
into	the	areas	of	inflammation.	Anemia	occurs	in	20%	of	patients,	and	
leukopenia	 is	 less	 common.	 A	 bone	 marrow	 examination	 will	 reveal	
granulomas	 in	 about	 a	 third	 of	 patients.	 Although	 splenomegaly	 can	
be	detected	in	5–10%	of	patients,	splenic	biopsy	reveals	granulomas	in	
60%	of	patients.	The	CT	scan	can	be	relatively	specific	for	sarcoidosis	
involvement	of	the	spleen	(Fig. 367-6).	Both	bone	marrow	and	spleen	
involvement	 are	 more	 common	 in	 African	 Americans	 than	 whites.	
Although	 these	 manifestations	 alone	 are	 rarely	 an	 indication	 for	
therapy,	on	rare	occasion,	splenectomy	may	be	indicated	for	massive	
symptomatic	 splenomegaly	 or	 profound	 pancytopenia.	 Nonthoracic	
lymphadenopathy	can	occur	in	up	to	20%	of	patients.

 ■ CALCIUM METABOLISM
Hypercalcemia	 and/or	 hypercalciuria	 occur	 in	 ~10%	 of	 sarcoidosis	
patients.	It	is	more	common	in	whites	than	African	Americans	and	in	
men.	 The	 mechanism	 of	 abnormal	 calcium	 metabolism	 is	 increased	
production	of	1,25-dihydroxyvitamin	D	by	the	granuloma	itself.	The	
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin	 D	 causes	 increased	 intestinal	 absorption	 of	
calcium,	 leading	 to	 hypercalcemia	 with	 a	 suppressed	 parathyroid	
hormone	 (PTH)	 level	 (Chap.  410).	 Increased	 exogenous	 vitamin	 D	
from	 diet	 or	 sunlight	 exposure	 may	 exacerbate	 this	 problem.	 Serum	
calcium	 should	 be	 determined	 as	 part	 of	 the	 initial	 evaluation	 of	 all	
sarcoidosis	patients,	and	a	repeat	determination	may	be	useful	during	
the	summer	months	with	increased	sun	exposure.	In	patients	with	a	
history	of	renal	calculi,	a	24-h	urine	calcium	measurement	should	be	
obtained.	If	a	sarcoidosis	patient	with	a	history	of	renal	calculi	is	to	be	
placed	on	calcium	supplements,	a	follow-up	24-h	urine	calcium	level	
should	be	measured.

problems	more	common	in	African	Americans	than	whites.	Although	
the	most	common	manifestation	is	anterior	uveitis,	over	a	quarter	of	
patients	will	have	inflammation	at	the	posterior	of	the	eye,	including	
retinitis	 and	 pars	 planitis.	 Although	 symptoms	 such	 as	 photophobia,	
blurred	 vision,	 and	 increased	 tearing	 can	 occur,	 some	 asymptomatic	
patients	still	have	active	inflammation.	Initially	asymptomatic	patients	
with	ocular	sarcoidosis	can	eventually	develop	blindness.	Therefore,	it	
is	recommended	that	all	patients	with	sarcoidosis	receive	a	dedicated	
ophthalmologic	examination.	Sicca	is	seen	in	over	one-half	of	chronic	
sarcoidosis	patients.	Dry	eyes	appear	to	be	a	reflection	of	prior	lacrimal	
gland	disease.	Although	the	patient	may	no	longer	have	active	inflam-
mation,	dry	eyes	may	require	natural	tears	or	other	lubricants.

 ■ LIVER
Using	biopsies	to	detect	granulomatous	disease,	liver	involvement	can	
be	identified	in	over	one-half	of	sarcoidosis	patients.	However,	using	
liver	 function	 studies,	 only	 20–30%	 of	 patients	 will	 have	 evidence	 of	
liver	 involvement.	 The	 most	 common	 abnormality	 of	 liver	 function

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disorders ■ RENAL DISEASE
Direct	 kidney	 involvement	 occurs	 in	 <5%	 of	 sarcoidosis	 patients.	 It	
is	 associated	 with	 granulomas	 in	 the	 kidney	 itself	 and	 can	 lead	 to	
nephritis.	 However,	 hypercalcemia	 is	 the	 most	 likely	 cause	 of	 sarcoi-
dosis-associated	 renal	 disease.	 In	 1–2%	 of	 sarcoidosis	 patients,	 acute	
renal	failure	may	develop	as	a	result	of	hypercalcemia.	Successful	treat-
ment	of	hypercalcemia	with	glucocorticoids	and	other	therapies	often	
improves	but	usually	does	not	totally	resolve	renal	dysfunction.
 ■ NERVOUS SYSTEM
Neurologic	 disease	 is	 reported	 in	 5–10%	 of	 sarcoidosis	 patients	 and	
appears	to	be	of	equal	frequency	across	all	ethnic	groups.	Any	part	of	
the	central	or	peripheral	nervous	system	can	be	affected.	The	presence	
of	granulomatous	inflammation	is	often	visible	on	MRI	studies.	MRI	
with	 gadolinium	 enhancement	 may	 demonstrate	 space-occupying	
lesions,	but	the	MRI	can	be	negative	due	to	small	lesions	or	the	effect	
of	systemic	therapy	in	reducing	the	inflammation.	Cerebral	spinal	fluid	
(CSF)	findings	include	lymphocytic	meningitis	with	a	mild	increase	in	
protein.	The	CSF	glucose	level	is	usually	normal	but	can	be	low.	Certain	
areas	of	the	nervous	system	are	more	commonly	affected	in	neurosar-
coidosis.	These	include	cranial	nerve	involvement,	basilar	meningitis,	
myelopathy,	and	anterior	hypothalamic	disease	with	associated	diabe-
tes	insipidus	(Chap. 381).	Seizures	and	cognitive	changes	also	occur.	
Of	 the	 cranial	 nerves,	 seventh	 nerve	 paralysis	 can	 be	 transient	 and	
mistaken	for	Bell’s	palsy	(idiopathic	seventh	nerve	paralysis).	Because	
this	form	of	neurosarcoidosis	often	resolves	within	weeks	and	may	not	
recur,	it	may	have	occurred	prior	to	a	definitive	diagnosis	of	sarcoido-
sis.	Optic	neuritis	is	another	cranial	nerve	manifestation	of	sarcoidosis.	
This	 manifestation	 is	 more	 chronic	 and	 usually	 requires	 long-term	
systemic	therapy.	It	can	be	associated	with	both	anterior	and	posterior	
uveitis.	Differentiating	between	neurosarcoidosis	and	multiple	sclero-
sis	can	be	difficult	at	times.	Optic	neuritis	can	occur	in	both	diseases.	
In	 some	 patients	 with	 sarcoidosis,	 multiple	 enhancing	 white	 matter	
abnormalities	may	be	detected	by	MRI,	suggesting	multiple	sclerosis.	
In	 such	 cases,	 the	 presence	 of	 meningeal	 enhancement	 or	 hypotha-
lamic	 involvement	 suggests	 neurosarcoidosis,	 as	 does	 evidence	 of	
extraneurologic	disease	such	as	pulmonary	or	skin	involvement,	which	
also	suggests	sarcoidosis.	Because	the	response	of	neurosarcoidosis	to	
glucocorticoids	and	cytotoxic	therapy	is	different	from	that	of	multiple	
sclerosis,	differentiating	between	these	disease	entities	is	important.
 ■ CARDIAC
The	presence	of	cardiac	involvement	is	influenced	by	race.	Although	
over	a	quarter	of	Japanese	sarcoidosis	patients	develop	cardiac	disease,	
only	5%	of	sarcoidosis	patients	in	the	United	States	and	Europe	develop	
symptomatic	 cardiac	 disease.	 However,	 there	 is	 no	 apparent	 racial	
predilection	between	whites	and	African	Americans.	Cardiac	disease,	
which	 usually	 presents	 as	 either	 congestive	 heart	 failure	 or	 cardiac	
arrhythmias,	 results	 from	 infiltration	 of	 the	 heart	 muscle	 by	 granu-
lomas.	 Diffuse	 granulomatous	 involvement	 of	 the	 heart	 muscle	 can	
lead	to	profound	dysfunction	with	left	ventricular	ejection	fractions	of	
<10%.	Even	in	this	situation,	improvement	in	the	ejection	fraction	can	
occur	with	systemic	therapy.	Arrhythmias	can	also	occur	with	diffuse	
infiltration	or	with	more	patchy	cardiac	involvement.	If	the	atrioven-
tricular	(AV)	node	is	infiltrated,	heart	block	can	occur,	which	can	be	
detected	by	routine	electrocardiography.	Ventricular	arrhythmias	and	
ventricular	tachycardia	are	common	causes	of	death.	Arrhythmias	are	
best	detected	using	24-h	ambulatory	monitoring,	and	electrophysiol-
ogy	studies	may	be	negative.	Other	screening	tests	for	cardiac	disease	
include	 routine	 electrocardiography	 and	 echocardiography.	 The	 con-
firmation	of	cardiac	sarcoidosis	is	usually	performed	with	either	MRI	
or	positron	emission	tomography	(PET)	scanning.	Because	ventricular	
arrhythmias	are	usually	multifocal	due	to	patchy	multiple	granulomas	
in	 the	 heart,	 ablation	 therapy	 is	 not	 useful.	 Patients	 with	 significant	
ventricular	 arrhythmias	 should	 be	 considered	 for	 an	 implanted	 defi-
brillator,	 which	 appears	 to	 have	 reduced	 the	 rate	 of	 death	 in	 cardiac	
sarcoidosis.	 Although	 systemic	 therapy	 can	 be	 useful	 in	 treating	
arrhythmias,	 patients	 may	 still	 have	 malignant	 arrhythmias	 up	 to		
6	months	after	starting	successful	treatment,	and	the	risk	for	recurrent	
arrhythmias	occurs	whenever	medications	are	tapered.

 ■ MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM
Direct	granulomatous	involvement	of	bone	and	muscle	can	be	docu-
mented	by	radiography	(x-ray,	MRI,	PET	scan	[Fig. 367-7],	or	gallium	
scan)	or	confirmed	by	biopsy	in	~10%	of	sarcoidosis	patients.	However,	
a	 larger	 percentage	 of	 sarcoidosis	 patients	 complain	 of	 myalgia	 and	
arthralgia.	These	complaints	are	similar	to	those	reported	by	patients	
with	 other	 inflammatory	 diseases,	 including	 chronic	 infections	 such	
as	 mononucleosis.	 Fatigue	 associated	 with	 sarcoidosis	 may	 be	 over-
whelming	for	many	patients.	A	link	between	fatigue	and	small	periph-
eral	nerve	fiber	disease	in	sarcoidosis	has	been	described.

 ■ OTHER ORGAN INVOLVEMENT
Although	 sarcoidosis	 can	 affect	 any	 organ	 of	 the	 body,	 rarely	 does	 it	
involve	 the	 breast,	 testes,	 ovary,	 or	 stomach.	 Because	 of	 the	 rarity	 of	
involvement,	a	mass	in	one	of	these	areas	requires	a	biopsy	to	rule	out	
other	diseases,	including	cancer.	For	example,	in	a	study	of	breast	prob-
lems	in	female	sarcoidosis	patients,	a	breast	lesion	was	more	likely	to	be	a	
granuloma	from	sarcoidosis	than	from	breast	cancer.	However,	findings	
on	the	physical	examination	or	mammogram	cannot	reliably	differentiate	
between	these	lesions.	More	importantly,	as	women	with	sarcoidosis	age,	
breast	cancer	becomes	more	common.	Therefore,	it	is	recommended	that	
routine	 screening	 including	 mammography	 be	 performed	 along	 with	
other	imaging	studies	(ultrasound,	MRI)	or	biopsy	as	clinically	indicated.

 ■ COMPLICATIONS
Sarcoidosis	is	usually	a	self-limited,	non-life-threatening	disease.	How-
ever,	 organ-threatening	 disease	 can	 occur.	 These	 complications	 can	
include	blindness,	paraplegia,	or	renal	failure.	Death	from	sarcoidosis	
occurs	in	~5%	of	patients	seen	in	sarcoidosis	referral	clinics.	The	usual	
causes	 of	 death	 related	 to	 sarcoidosis	 are	 from	 lung,	 cardiac,	 neuro-
logic,	 or	 liver	 involvement.	 In	 respiratory	 failure,	 an	 elevation	 of	 the	
right	atrial	pressure	is	a	poor	prognostic	finding.	Lung	complications	
can	also	include	infections	such	as	mycetoma,	which	can	subsequently	
lead	to	massive	bleeding.	In	addition,	the	use	of	immunosuppressive	
agents	can	increase	the	incidence	of	serious	infections.

2834 LABORATORY FINDINGS

The	 chest	 roentgenogram	 remains	 the	 most	 commonly	 used	 tool	
to	 assess	 lung	 involvement	 in	 sarcoidosis.	 As	 noted	 above,	 the	 chest	
roentgenogram	 classifies	 involvement	 into	 four	 stages,	 with	 stages	 1	
and	2	having	hilar	and	paratracheal	adenopathy.	The	CT	scan	has	been	
used	increasingly	in	evaluating	interstitial	lung	disease.	In	sarcoidosis,	
the	presence	of	adenopathy	and	a	nodular	infiltrate	is	not	specific	for	
sarcoidosis.	Adenopathy	up	to	2	cm	can	be	seen	in	other	inflammatory	
lung	diseases	such	as	idiopathic	pulmonary	fibrosis.	However,	adenop-
athy	>2	cm	in	the	short	axis	supports	the	diagnosis	of	sarcoidosis	over	
other	interstitial	lung	diseases.

The	PET	scan	has	increasingly	replaced	gallium-67	scanning	to	iden-
tify	areas	of	granulomatous	disease	in	the	chest	and	other	parts	of	the	
body	(Fig.	367-7).	Both	tests	can	be	used	to	identify	potential	areas	for	
biopsy.	Cardiac	PET	scanning	has	also	proved	useful	in	assessing	cardiac	
sarcoidosis.	The	identification	of	hypermetabolic	activity	may	be	due	to	
the	granulomas	from	sarcoidosis	and	not	to	disseminated	malignancy.

MRI	 has	 also	 proved	 useful	 in	 the	 assessment	 of	 extrapulmonary	
sarcoidosis.	Gadolinium	enhancement	has	been	demonstrated	in	areas	
of	inflammation	in	the	brain,	heart,	and	bone.	MRI	scans	may	detect	
asymptomatic	lesions.	Like	the	PET	scan,	MRI	changes	appear	similar	
to	 those	 seen	 with	 malignancy	 and	 infection.	 In	 some	 cases,	 biopsy	
may	be	necessary	to	determine	the	cause	of	the	radiologic	abnormality.
Serum	levels	of	angiotensin-converting	enzyme	(ACE)	can	be	help-
ful	in	the	diagnosis	of	sarcoidosis.	However,	the	test	has	somewhat	low	
sensitivity	and	specificity.	Elevated	levels	of	ACE	are	reported	in	60%	
of	 patients	 with	 acute	 disease	 and	 only	 20%	 of	 patients	 with	 chronic	
disease.	Although	there	are	several	causes	for	mild	elevation	of	ACE,	
including	diabetes,	elevations	of	>50%	of	the	upper	limit	of	normal	are	
seen	in	only	a	few	conditions	including	sarcoidosis,	leprosy,	Gaucher’s	
disease,	hyperthyroidism,	and	disseminated	granulomatous	infections	
such	as	miliary	tuberculosis.	Because	the	ACE	level	is	determined	by	a	
biologic	assay,	the	concurrent	use	of	an	ACE	inhibitor	such	as	lisinopril	
will	lead	to	a	very	low	ACE	level.

DIAGNOSIS
The	diagnosis	of	sarcoidosis	requires	both	compatible	clinical	features	
and	pathologic	findings.	Because	the	cause	of	sarcoidosis	remains	elu-
sive,	the	diagnosis	cannot	be	made	with	100%	certainty.	Nevertheless,	
the	diagnosis	can	be	made	with	reasonable	certainty	based	on	history	
and	physical	features	along	with	laboratory	and	pathologic	findings.

Patients	are	usually	evaluated	for	possible	sarcoidosis	based	on	two	
scenarios	(Fig. 367-8).	In	the	first	scenario,	a	patient	may	undergo	a	
biopsy	revealing	a	noncaseating	granuloma	in	either	a	pulmonary	or	
an	extrapulmonary	organ.	If	the	clinical	presentation	is	consistent	with	
sarcoidosis	and	there	is	no	alternative	cause	for	the	granulomas	identi-
fied,	the	patient	is	felt	to	have	sarcoidosis.

In	 the	 second	 scenario,	 signs	 or	 symptoms	 suggesting	 sarcoidosis	
such	 as	 the	 presence	 of	 bilateral	 adenopathy	 may	 be	 present	 in	 an	
otherwise	asymptomatic	patient	or	a	patient	with	uveitis	or	a	rash	con-
sistent	with	sarcoidosis.	At	this	point,	a	diagnostic	procedure	should	be	
performed.	For	the	patient	with	a	compatible	skin	lesion,	a	skin	biopsy	
should	be	considered.	Other	biopsies	to	consider	could	include	liver,	
extrathoracic	 lymph	 node,	 or	 muscle.	 In	 some	 cases,	 a	 biopsy	 of	 the	
affected	organ	may	not	be	easy	to	perform	(such	as	a	brain	or	spinal	
cord	 lesion).	 In	 other	 cases,	 such	 as	 an	 endomyocardial	 biopsy,	 the	
likelihood	of	a	positive	biopsy	is	low.	Because	of	the	high	rate	of	pul-
monary	involvement	in	these	cases,	the	lung	may	be	easier	to	approach	
by	 bronchoscopy.	 During	 the	 bronchoscopy,	 a	 transbronchial	 biopsy,	
bronchial	biopsy,	or	transbronchial	needle	aspirate	can	be	performed.	
The	 endobronchial	 ultrasonography-guided	 (EBUS)	 transbronchial	
needle	 aspirate	 can	 assist	 in	 diagnosing	 sarcoidosis	 in	 patients	 with	
mediastinal	adenopathy	(stage	1	or	2	radiographic	pulmonary	disease),	
whereas	transbronchial	biopsy	has	a	higher	diagnostic	yield	for	those	
with	only	parenchymal	lung	disease	(stage	3).	These	tests	are	comple-
mentary	and	may	be	performed	together.

If	 the	 biopsy	 reveals	 granulomas,	 an	 alternative	 diagnosis	 such	 as	
infection	 or	 malignancy	 must	 be	 excluded.	 Bronchoscopic	 washings	
can	be	sent	for	cultures	for	fungi	and	tuberculosis.	For	the	pathologist,

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disordersthe	more	tissue	that	is	provided,	the	more	comfortable	is	the	diagno-
sis	of	sarcoidosis.	A	needle	aspirate	may	be	adequate	in	an	otherwise	
classic	case	of	sarcoidosis	but	may	be	insufficient	in	a	patient	in	whom	
lymphoma	or	fungal	infection	is	a	likely	alternative	diagnosis.	Because	
granulomas	can	be	seen	on	the	edge	of	a	lymphoma,	the	presence	of	a	
few	granulomas	from	a	needle	aspirate	may	not	be	sufficient	to	clarify	
the	diagnosis.	Mediastinoscopy	provides	a	larger	sample	to	confirm	the	
presence	or	absence	of	lymphoma	in	the	mediastinum.	Alternatively,	
for	most	patients,	evidence	of	extrathoracic	disease	(e.g.,	eye	involve-
ment)	may	further	support	the	diagnosis	of	sarcoidosis.

For	patients	with	negative	pathology,	positive	supportive	tests	may	
increase	 the	 likelihood	 of	 the	 diagnosis	 of	 sarcoidosis.	 These	 tests	
include	 an	 elevated	 ACE	 level,	 which	 can	 also	 be	 elevated	 in	 other	
granulomatous	 diseases	 but	 not	 in	 malignancy.	 A	 positive	 PET	 scan	
can	support	the	diagnosis	if	multiple	organs	are	affected.	BAL	is	often	
performed	during	the	bronchoscopy.	An	increase	in	the	percentage	of	
lymphocytes	 supports	 the	 diagnosis	 of	 sarcoidosis.	 The	 lymphocyte	
markers	CD4	and	CD8	can	be	used	to	determine	the	CD4/CD8	ratio	of	
these	increased	lymphocytes	in	the	BAL	fluid.	A	ratio	of	>3.5	is	strongly	
supportive	of	sarcoidosis	but	is	less	sensitive	than	an	increase	in	lym-
phocytes	alone.	Although	in	general	an	increase	in	BAL	lymphocytes	
is	supportive	of	the	diagnosis,	other	conditions	must	be	considered.

Supportive	findings,	when	combined	with	commonly	associated	but	
nondiagnostic	clinical	features	of	the	disease,	improve	the	diagnostic	
probability	of	sarcoidosis.	These	clinical	features	include	uveitis,	renal	
stones,	 hypercalcemia,	 seventh	 cranial	 nerve	 paralysis,	 and	 erythema	
nodosum.	 A	 sarcoidosis	 diagnostic	 score	 has	 been	 developed	 that	
incorporates	the	cumulative	information	from	multiorgan	involvement	
and	allows	one	to	quantitate	the	likelihood	of	sarcoidosis.

Because	the	diagnosis	of	sarcoidosis	can	never	be	certain,	over	time,	
other	 features	 may	 arise	 that	 lead	 to	 an	 alternative	 diagnosis.	 Con-
versely,	evidence	for	new	organ	involvement	may	eventually	confirm	
the	diagnosis	of	sarcoidosis.

PROGNOSIS
The	risk	of	death	or	loss	of	organ	function	remains	low	in	sarcoidosis.	
Poor	 outcomes	 usually	 occur	 in	 patients	 who	 present	 with	 advanced	
disease	in	whom	treatment	seems	to	have	little	impact.	In	these	cases,	
irreversible	 fibrotic	 changes	 have	 frequently	 occurred.	 The	 overall	
mortality	 of	 sarcoidosis	 is	 approximately	 5%.	 Mortality	 is	 associated	
with	 advanced	 pulmonary	 fibrosis	 (>20%	 fibrosis	 on	 chest	 CT	 scan	
and/or	 DLCO	 <50%)	 and	 pulmonary	 hypertension.	 Over	 the	 past		
20	 years,	 the	 reported	 mortality	 from	 sarcoidosis	 has	 increased	 in	
the	 United	 States	 and	 England.	 Whether	 this	 is	 due	 to	 heightened	

awareness	 of	 the	 chronic	 nature	 of	 this	 disease	 or	 to	 other	 factors	
such	 as	 more	 widespread	 immunosuppressive	 therapy	 usage	 remains	
unclear.

For	the	majority	of	patients,	initial	presentation	occurs	during	the	
granulomatous	 phase	 of	 the	 disease,	 as	 depicted	 in	 Fig.	 367-1.	 It	 is	
clear	that	many	patients	resolve	their	disease	within	2–5	years.	These	
patients	are	felt	to	have	acute,	self-limiting	sarcoidosis.	However,	there	
is	a	form	of	the	disease	that	does	not	resolve	within	the	first	2–5	years.	
These	 chronic	 patients	 can	 be	 identified	 at	 presentation	 by	 certain	
risk	 factors	 at	 presentation	 such	 as	 fibrosis	 on	 chest	 roentgenogram,	
presence	 of	 lupus	 pernio,	 bone	 cysts,	 cardiac	 or	 neurologic	 disease	
(except	isolated	seventh	nerve	paralysis),	and	presence	of	renal	calculi	
due	to	hypercalciuria.	In	several	studies,	patients	who	required	gluco-
corticoids	for	any	manifestation	of	their	disease	in	the	first	6	months	
of	presentation	had	a	>50%	chance	of	having	chronic	disease.	In	con-
trast,	<10%	of	patients	who	required	no	systemic	therapy	in	the	first		
6	months	required	chronic	therapy.

TREATMENT
Sarcoidosis

The	 decision	 to	 treat	 sarcoidosis	 is	 based	 on	 two	 indications:	 to	
avoid	danger	or	improve	quality	of	life.	A	dangerous	outcome	from	
sarcoidosis	 is	 the	 possibility	 of	 organ-	 or	 life-threatening	 disease,	
including	 disease	 involving	 the	 eye,	 heart,	 or	 nervous	 system.	
The	patient	with	asymptomatic	elevated	liver	function	tests	or	an	
abnormal	 chest	 roentgenogram	 probably	 does	 not	 benefit	 from	
treatment.	 However,	 these	 patients	 should	 be	 monitored	 for	 evi-
dence	of	progressive,	symptomatic	disease.	Improvement	of	quality	
of	 life	 is	 an	 important	 indication	 to	 treat;	 however,	 one	 must	 be	
careful	to	avoid	toxicity	from	therapy	that	is	more	problematic	than	
the	disease	itself.

One	approach	to	therapy	is	summarized	in	Figs. 367-9 and 367-10.	
We	 have	 divided	 the	 approach	 into	 treating	 acute	 versus	 chronic	
disease.	For	acute	disease,	no	therapy	remains	a	viable	option	for	
patients	with	no	or	mild	symptoms.	For	symptoms	confined	to	only	
one	organ,	topical	therapy	is	preferable.	For	multiorgan	disease	or	
disease	 too	 extensive	 for	 topical	 therapy,	 an	 approach	 to	 systemic	
therapy	 is	 outlined.	 Glucocorticoids	 remain	 the	 drugs	 of	 choice	
for	 this	 disease.	 However,	 the	 decision	 to	 continue	 to	 treat	 with	
glucocorticoids	or	to	add	steroid-sparing	agents	depends	on	the	tol-
erability,	duration,	and	dosage	of	glucocorticoids.	Table 367-2	sum-
marizes	the	dosage	and	monitoring	of	several	commonly	used	drugs.	
According	to	the	available	trials,	evidence-based	recommendations

are	made.	Most	of	these	recommendations	are	for	pulmonary	dis-
ease	because	most	of	the	trials	were	performed	only	in	pulmonary	
disease.	 Treatment	 recommendations	 for	 extrapulmonary	 disease	
are	usually	similar	with	a	few	modifications.	For	example,	the	dos-
age	 of	 glucocorticoids	 is	 usually	 higher	 for	 neurosarcoidosis	 and	
lower	for	cutaneous	disease.	There	was	some	suggestion	that	higher	
doses	 would	 be	 beneficial	 for	 cardiac	 sarcoidosis,	 but	 one	 study	
found	that	initial	prednisone	doses	>40	mg/d	were	associated	with	
a	worse	outcome	because	of	toxicity.

Systemic	 therapies	 for	 sarcoidosis	 are	 usually	 immunosuppres-
sive,	 including	 glucocorticoids,	 cytotoxics,	 or	 biologics.	 Although	
most	 patients	 receive	 glucocorticoids	 as	 their	 initial	 systemic	
therapy,	 toxicity	 associated	 with	 prolonged	 therapy	 often	 leads	
to	 steroid-sparing	 alternatives.	 The	 antimalarial	 drugs,	 such	 as	
hydroxychloroquine,	 are	 more	 effective	 for	 skin	 than	 pulmonary	
disease.	Minocycline	may	also	be	useful	for	cutaneous	sarcoidosis.	
For	pulmonary	and	other	extrapulmonary	disease,	cytotoxic	agents	
that	 include	 methotrexate,	 azathioprine,	 leflunomide,	 mycophe-
nolate,	 and	 cyclophosphamide	 are	 often	 used.	 The	 most	 widely	
studied	 cytotoxic	 agent	 has	 been	 methotrexate.	 This	 agent	 works	
in	 approximately	 two-thirds	 of	 sarcoidosis	 patients,	 regardless	 of	
the	 disease	 manifestation.	 In	 one	 retrospective	 study	 comparing	

methotrexate	with	azathioprine,	both	drugs	were	equally	effective.	
However,	 methotrexate	 was	 associated	 with	 significantly	 less	 tox-
icity.	 As	 noted	 in	 Table	 367-2,	 specific	 guidelines	 for	 monitoring	
therapy	 have	 been	 recommended.	 Cytokine	 modulators	 such	 as	
thalidomide	 and	 pentoxifylline	 have	 also	 been	 used	 in	 a	 limited	
number	of	cases.

The	biologic	anti-TNF	agents	have	recently	been	studied	in	sar-
coidosis,	with	prospective	randomized	trials	completed	for	etaner-
cept,	golimumab,	and	infliximab.	Etanercept	has	a	limited	role	as	a	
steroid-sparing	 agent.	 Golimumab	 was	 not	 significantly	 different	
than	placebo	in	treating	chronic	pulmonary	disease.	However,	this	
may	have	been	due	to	the	relatively	low	dose	of	golimumab	studied.	
Infliximab	significantly	improved	lung	function	when	administered	
to	 glucocorticoid	 and	 cytotoxic	 pretreated	 patients	 with	 chronic	
disease.	The	difference	in	response	between	etanercept	and	inflixi-
mab	is	similar	to	that	observed	in	Crohn’s	disease,	where	infliximab	
is	effective	and	etanercept	is	not.	However,	there	is	a	higher	risk	for	
reactivation	of	tuberculosis	with	infliximab	compared	with	etaner-
cept.	 The	 differential	 response	 rate	 could	 be	 explained	 by	 differ-
ences	in	mechanism	of	action	because	etanercept	is	a	TNF	receptor	
antagonist	and	infliximab	is	a	monoclonal	antibody	against	TNF.	In	
contrast	to	etanercept,	infliximab	also	binds	to	TNF	on	the	surface

368 IgG4-Related Disease

John H. Stone

IgG4-related	 disease	 (IgG4-RD)	 is	 a	 fibroinflammatory	 condition	
characterized	by	a	tendency	to	form	tumefactive	lesions.	The	clinical	
manifestations	of	this	disease,	however,	are	protean,	as	IgG4-RD	can	
affect	 virtually	 any	 organ	 system.	 Commonly	 affected	 organs	 are	 the	
pancreas,	biliary	tree,	major	salivary	glands	(submandibular,	parotid),	
periorbital	tissues,	kidneys,	lungs,	lymph	nodes,	and	retroperitoneum.	
In	 addition,	 IgG4-RD	 involvement	 of	 the	 meninges,	 aorta,	 prostate,	
thyroid,	 pericardium,	 skin,	 and	 other	 organs	 is	 well	 described.	 The	
disease	affects	the	brain	parenchyma,	the	joints,	the	bone	marrow,	and	
the	bowel	mucosa	only	rarely.

The	 pathologic	 findings	 are	 consistent	 across	 all	 affected	 organs.	
These	 findings	 include	 a	 lymphoplasmacytic	 infiltrate	 with	 a	 high	
percentage	 of	 IgG4-positive	 plasma	 cells;	 a	 characteristic	 pattern	 of	
fibrosis	 termed	 “storiform”	 (from	 the	 Latin	storea,	 for	 “woven	 mat”);	
a	 tendency	 to	 target	 blood	 vessels,	 particularly	 veins,	 through	 an	
obliterative	 process	 (“obliterative	 phlebitis”);	 and	 a	 mild	 to	 moderate	
tissue	 eosinophilia.	 Although	 the	 pathology	 is	 consistent	 from	 organ	
to	organ,	it	is	essentially	never	diagnostic	in	and	of	itself.	Classification	
criteria	emphasize	the	importance	of	careful	correlation	among	clini-
cal,	serologic,	radiologic,	and	pathologic	findings	in	deciding	whether	
a	patient	should	be	classified	as	having	IgG4-RD.	Biopsy	is	not	required	
in	 order	 to	 establish	 the	 diagnosis	 in	 classic	 cases,	 but	 most	 patients	
undergo	a	biopsy	at	some	point	in	the	evaluation	in	order	to	exclude	
malignancy.

IgG4-RD	encompasses	a	number	of	conditions	previously	regarded	
as	separate,	organ-specific	entities.	A	condition	once	known	as	“lym-
phoplasmacytic	 sclerosing	 pancreatitis”	 became	 the	 paradigm	 of	
IgG4-RD	 in	 2000,	 when	 Japanese	 investigators	 recognized	 that	 these	
patients	had	elevated	serum	concentrations	of	IgG4.	This	form	of	scle-
rosing	 pancreatitis	 is	 now	 termed	 type  1  (IgG4-related)  autoimmune 
pancreatitis	 (AIP).	 By	 2003,	 extrapancreatic	 disease	 manifestations	
had	 been	 identified	 in	 patients	 with	 type	 1	 AIP,	 and	 descriptions	 of	
IgG4-RD	in	other	organs	followed.	Mikulicz’s disease,	once	considered	
to	be	a	subset	of	Sjögren’s	syndrome	that	affected	the	lacrimal,	parotid,	

and	submandibular	glands,	is	one	of	the	most	common	presentations	
of	IgG4-RD.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
The	 major	 organ	 lesions	 are	 summarized	 in	 Table  368-1.	 IgG4-RD	
usually	presents	subacutely,	and	even	in	the	setting	of	multiorgan	dis-
ease,	most	patients	do	not	have	fevers	or	high	elevations	of	C-reactive	
protein	 levels.	 Some	 patients,	 however,	 experience	 substantial	 weight	
loss	 over	 periods	 of	 months,	 largely	 because	 of	 exocrine	 pancreatic	
failure.	Failure	of	the	endocrine	pancreas,	leading	to	diabetes	mellitus,	
is	also	common.	Clinically	apparent	disease	can	evolve	over	months,	
years,	or	even	decades	before	the	manifestations	within	a	given	organ	
become	 sufficiently	 severe	 to	 bring	 the	 patient	 to	 medical	 attention.	
Some	 patients	 have	 disease	 that	 is	 marked	 by	 the	 appearance	 and	
then	 resolution	 or	 temporary	 improvement	 in	 symptoms	 within	 a	
particular	organ.	Other	patients	accumulate	new	organ	involvement	as	
their	disease	persists	in	previously	affected	organs.	Many	patients	with	
IgG4-RD	 are	 misdiagnosed	 as	 having	 other	 conditions,	 particularly	
malignancies,	 or	 their	 findings	 are	 attributed	 initially	 to	 nonspecific	
inflammation.	 The	 disorder	 is	 often	 identified	 incidentally	 through	
radiologic	findings	or	unexpectedly	in	pathology	specimens.

Multiorgan	disease	may	be	evident	at	diagnosis	but	can	also	evolve	
over	months	to	years.	Some	patients	have	disease	confined	to	a	single	
organ	for	many	years.	Others	have	either	known	or	subclinical	organ	
involvement	 at	 the	 same	 time	 as	 the	 major	 clinical	 feature.	 Patients	
with	type	1	AIP	may	have	their	major	disease	focus	in	the	pancreas;	
however,	thorough	evaluations	by	history,	physical	examination,	blood	
tests,	 and	 cross-sectional	 imaging	 may	 demonstrate	 lacrimal	 gland	
enlargement,	sialoadenitis,	lymphadenopathy,	a	variety	of	pulmonary	
findings,	 tubulointerstitial	 nephritis,	 hepatobiliary	 disease,	 aortitis,	
retroperitoneal	fibrosis,	or	other	organ	involvement.

Two	 common	 characteristics	 of	 IgG4-RD	 are	 allergic	 disease	 and	
the	 tendency	 to	 form	 tumefactive	 lesions	 that	 mimic	 malignancies	
(Fig.  368-1).	 Many	 IgG4-RD	 patients	 have	 allergic	 features	 such	 as	
atopy,	eczema,	asthma,	nasal	polyps,	sinusitis,	and	modest	peripheral	
eosinophilia.	IgG4-RD	also	appears	to	account	for	a	significant	propor-
tion	 of	 tumorous	 swellings—pseudotumors—in	 many	 organ	 systems	
(Fig.  368-2).	 Some	 patients	 undergo	 major	 surgeries	 (e.g.,	 modified	
Whipple	 procedures	 or	 thyroidectomy)	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 resecting	
malignancies	before	the	correct	diagnosis	is	identified.

IgG4-RD	often	causes	major	morbidity	and	can	lead	to	organ	failure;	
however,	its	general	pattern	is	to	cause	damage	in	a	subacute	manner.	
Destructive	 bone	 lesions	 in	 the	 sinuses,	 head,	 and	 middle	 ear	 spaces	
that	 mimic	 granulomatosis	 with	 polyangiitis	 occur	 occasionally	 in	
IgG4-RD,	 but	 less	 aggressive	 lesions	 are	 the	 rule	 in	 most	 organs.	 In	
regions	such	as	the	retroperitoneum,	substantial	fibrosis	often	occurs	
before	 the	 diagnosis	 is	 established,	 leading	 to	 ureteral	 entrapment,	
hydronephrosis,	postobstructive	uropathy,	and	renal	atrophy.	Undiag-
nosed	or	undertreated	IgG4-related	sclerosing	cholangitis	can	lead	to	
hepatic	failure	within	months.	Similarly,	IgG4-related	aortitis	can	cause	
aneurysms	 and	 dissections.	 Substantial	 renal	 dysfunction	 and	 even	
renal	failure	can	ensue	from	IgG4-related	tubulointerstitial	nephritis,	
and	renal	atrophy	is	a	frequent	sequel	to	this	disease	complication	even	
following	 apparently	 effective	 immunosuppressive	 therapy.	 IgG4-related	
membranous	 glomerulonephropathy,	 a	 less	 common	 renal	 manifes-
tation	 than	 tubulointerstitial	 nephritis,	 must	 be	 distinguished	 from	
idiopathic	membranous	glomerulonephropathy.

 ■ SEROLOGIC FINDINGS
The	majority	of	patients	with	IgG4-RD	have	elevated	serum	IgG4	con-
centrations;	 however,	 the	 range	 of	 elevation	 varies	 widely.	 Serum	 con-
centrations	of	IgG4	as	high	as	30	or	40	times	the	upper	limit	of	normal	
sometimes	 occur,	 usually	 in	 patients	 with	 disease	 that	 affects	 multiple	
organ	systems	simultaneously.	Approximately	30%	of	patients	have	nor-
mal	serum	IgG4	concentrations	despite	classic	histopathologic	and	immu-
nohistochemical	findings.	Such	patients	tend	to	have	disease	that	affects	
fewer	 organs.	 Patients	 with	 IgG4-related	 retroperitoneal	 fibrosis	 often	
have	normal	serum	IgG4	concentrations,	perhaps	because	the	process	has	
advanced	to	a	fibrotic	stage	by	the	time	the	diagnosis	is	considered.

MAJOR CLINICAL FEATURES
Painless eyelid or periocular tissue swelling; orbital pseudotumor; dacryoadenitis; dacryocystitis; orbital myositis; and mass lesions 
extending into the pterygopalatine fossa and infiltrating along the trigeminal nerve
Allergic phenomena (nasal polyps, asthma, allergic rhinitis, peripheral eosinophilia); nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, anosmia, chronic 
sinusitis; occasional bone-destructive lesions
Submandibular and/or parotid gland enlargement (isolated bilateral submandibular gland involvement more common); minor salivary 
glands sometimes involved
Headache, radiculopathy, cranial nerve palsies, or other symptoms resulting from spinal cord compression; tendency to form mass 
lesions; MRI shows marked thickening and enhancement of dura
Clinical syndromes resulting from involvement of the hypothalamus and pituitary, e.g., anterior pituitary hormone deficiency, central 
diabetes insipidus, or both; imaging reveals thickened pituitary stalk or mass formation on the stalk, swelling of the pituitary gland, or 
mass formation within the pituitary
Generalized lymphadenopathy or localized disease adjacent to a specific affected organ; the lymph nodes involved are generally  
1–2 cm in diameter and nontender
Riedel’s thyroiditis; fibrosing variant of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
Asymptomatic finding on lung imaging; cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, pleural effusion, or chest discomfort; associated with 
parenchymal lung involvement, pleural disease, or both; four main clinical lung syndromes: inflammatory pseudotumor, paravertebral 
mass often extending over several vertebrae, central airway disease, localized or diffuse interstitial pneumonia; pleural lesions have 
severe, nodular thickening of the visceral or parietal pleura with diffuse sclerosing inflammation, sometimes associated with pleural 
effusion
Asymptomatic finding on radiologic studies; surprise finding at elective aortic surgery; aortic dissection; clinicopathologic syndromes 
described include lymphoplasmacytic aortitis of thoracic or abdominal aorta, aortic dissection, periaortitis and periarteritis, and 
inflammatory abdominal aneurysm
Backache, lower abdominal pain, lower extremity edema, hydronephrosis from ureteral involvement, asymptomatic finding on 
radiologic studies. Classic radiologic appearance is periaortic inflammation extending caudally to involve the iliac vessels.
Tubulointerstitial nephritis; membranous glomerulonephritis in a small minority; asymptomatic tumoral lesions, typically multiple and 
bilateral, are sometimes detected on radiologic studies; renal involvement strongly associated with hypocomplementemia
Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis, presenting as mild abdominal pain; weight loss; acute, obstructive jaundice, mimicking 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (including a pancreatic mass); between 20 and 50% of patients present with acute glucose 
intolerance; imaging shows diffuse (termed “sausage-shaped pancreas”) or segmental pancreatic enlargement, with loss of normal 
lobularity; a mass often raises the suspicion of malignancy
Obstructive jaundice associated with autoimmunity in most cases; weight loss; steatorrhea; abdominal pain; and new-onset diabetes 
mellitus; mimicker of primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma
Gallbladder, liver (mass), breast (pseudotumor), prostate (prostatism), pericardium (constrictive pericarditis), mesentery (sclerosing 
mesenteritis), mediastinum (fibrosing mediastinitis), skin (erythematous or flesh-colored papules), peripheral nerve (perineural 
inflammation)

Correlations	 between	 serum	 IgG4	 concentrations,	 disease	 activity,	
and	the	need	for	treatment	are	imperfect.	Serum	IgG4	concentrations	
typically	 decline	 swiftly	 with	 the	 institution	 of	 therapy	 but	 often	 do	
not	 normalize	 completely.	 Patients	 can	 achieve	 clinical	 remissions	
yet	 have	 persistently	 elevated	 serum	 IgG4	 concentrations.	 Following	
treatment	and	a	disease	response,	however,	steadily	rising	serum	IgG4	

concentrations	are	useful	in	identifying	patients	at	risk	for	clinical	flares	
who	should	be	considered	for	re-treatment.	Clinical	relapses	occur	in	
some	patients	despite	persistently	normal	IgG4	concentrations.

IgG4	concentrations	in	serum	are	usually	measured	by	nephelome-
try	assays.	In	the	setting	of	extremely	high	serum	IgG4	concentrations,	
these	 assays	 can	 generate	 spuriously	 low	 IgG4	 values	 because	 of	 the

FIGURE  368-3  Hallmark  histopathology  characteristics  of  IgG4-related  disease 
(IgG4-RD)  are  a  dense  lymphoplasmacytic  infiltrate  and  a  mild  to  moderate 
eosinophilic infiltrate. The cellular inflammation is often encased in a distinctive 
type  of  fibrosis  termed  “storiform,”  which  often  has  a  basket  weave  pattern. 
Abundant  fibroblasts  and  strands  of  fibrosis  accompany  the  lymphoplasmacytic 
infiltrate in this figure. This biopsy is from a patient with IgG4-related hypertrophic 
pachymeningitis. However, the findings are identical to the pathology found in the 
pancreas, kidneys, lungs, salivary glands, and other organs affected by IgG4-RD.

pattern,	 obliterative	 phlebitis,	 and	 a	 mild	 to	 moderate	 eosinophilic	
infiltrate.	 Lymphoid	 follicles	 and	 germinal	 centers	 are	 frequently	
observed.	 The	 infiltrate	 tends	 to	 aggregate	 around	 ductal	 structures	
when	it	affects	glands.	The	inflammatory	lesion	often	aggregates	into	
tumefactive	masses	that	destroy	the	involved	tissue.

Obliterative	 arteritis	 is	 observed	 in	 some	 organs,	 particularly	 the	
lung;	however,	venous	involvement	is	more	common	(and	is	indeed	a	
hallmark	of	IgG4-RD).	Several	histopathology	features	are	uncommon	
in	 IgG4-RD	 and,	 when	 detected,	 mitigate	 against	 the	 diagnosis	 of	
IgG4-RD.	 These	 include	 intense	 neutrophilic	 infiltration,	 leukocyto-
clasis,	 granulomatous	 inflammation,	 multinucleated	 giant	 cells,	 and	
fibrinoid	necrosis.

The	inflammatory	infiltrate	is	composed	of	an	admixture	of	B	and	T	
lymphocytes.	B	cells	are	typically	organized	in	germinal	centers.	Plasma	
cells	staining	for	CD19,	CD138,	and	IgG4	appear	to	radiate	from	the	
germinal	centers.	In	contrast,	the	T	cells,	usually	CD4+,	are	distributed	
more	diffusely	throughout	the	lesion	and	generally	represent	the	most	
abundant	cell	type.	Fibroblasts,	histiocytes,	and	eosinophils	can	all	be	
observed	in	moderate	numbers.	Some	biopsy	samples	are	particularly	
enriched	 with	 eosinophils.	 In	 other	 samples,	 particularly	 from	 long-
standing	cases,	fibrosis	predominates.

The	histologic	appearance	of	IgG4-RD,	although	highly	characteris-
tic,	requires	immunohistochemical	confirmation	of	the	diagnosis	with	
IgG4	immunostaining.	IgG4-positive	plasma	cells	predominate	within	
the	 lesion,	 but	 plasma	 cells	 containing	 immunoglobulins	 from	 each	
subclass	can	be	found.	The	number	of	IgG4-positive	plasma	cells	can	
be	quantified	by	either	counting	the	number	of	cells	per	high-power	
field	(HPF)	or	by	calculating	the	ratio	of	IgG4-	to	IgG-bearing	plasma	
cells.	Tissue	fibrosis	predominates	in	the	latter	phases	of	organ	involve-
ment,	and	in	this	relatively	acellular	phase	of	inflammation,	both	the	
IgG4:total	IgG	ratio	and	the	pattern	of	tissue	fibrosis	are	more	impor-
tant	 than	 the	 number	 of	 IgG4-positive	 cells	 per	 HPF	 in	 establishing	
the	diagnosis.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Despite	 the	 emphasis	 of	 IgG4	 in	 the	 name	 of	 this	 disease,	 the	 IgG4	
molecule	 is	 not	 believed	 to	 play	 a	 direct	 role	 in	 the	 pathophysiology	
of	 disease	 within	 most	 organs.	 The	 IgG4	 molecule	 can	 undergo	 Fab	
exchange,	 a	 phenomenon	 in	 which	 the	 two	 halves	 of	 the	 molecule	
dissociate	 from	 each	 other	 and	 reassociate	 with	 hemi-molecules	 of	
different	antigen	specificity	that	have	originated	from	other	dissociated

prozone	effect.	Failure	to	identify	dramatic	serum	IgG4	elevations	can	
have	a	substantial	impact	on	patients	because	that	subset	of	patients	is	
at	greatest	risk	for	multiorgan	disease	and	substantial	end-organ	injury.	
The	prozone	effect	should	be	considered	when	the	results	of	serologic	
testing	for	IgG4	concentrations	are	normal	despite	the	presence	of	clin-
ical	features	that	strongly	suggest	IgG4-RD.	This	effect	can	be	corrected	
by	dilution	of	the	serum	sample	in	the	laboratory.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
The	typical	patient	with	IgG4-RD	is	a	middle-aged	to	elderly	man.	This	
epidemiology	stands	in	stark	contrast	to	that	of	many	classic	autoim-
mune	conditions,	which	tend	to	affect	young	women.	Studies	of	AIP	
patients	in	Japan	indicate	that	the	male-to-female	ratio	in	that	disease	
subset	is	on	the	order	of	3:1.	A	striking	male	predominance	has	also	
been	 reported	 in	 IgG4-related	 tubulointerstitial	 nephritis	 and	 IgG4-	
related	 retroperitoneal	 fibrosis,	 but	 among	 IgG4-RD	 manifestations	
that	involve	organs	of	the	head	and	neck—the	orbits,	lacrimal	glands,	
and	major	salivary	glands—the	sex	ratio	may	be	closer	to	1:1.
 ■ PATHOLOGY
The	key	histopathology	characteristics	of	IgG4-RD	are	a	dense	lymp-
hoplasmacytic	 infiltrate	 (Fig.  368-3)	 that	 is	 organized	 in	 a	 storiform

2840 IgG4	molecules.	Partly	as	a	result	of	this	Fab	exchange,	IgG4	antibodies	
do	not	bind	antigen	tightly.	Moreover,	the	molecules	have	low	affinities	
for	Fc	receptors	and	C1q	and	are	regarded	generally	as	noninflamma-
tory	 immunoglobulins.	 The	 low	 affinities	 for	 Fc	 receptors	 and	 C1q	
impair	 the	 ability	 of	 IgG4	 antibodies	 to	 induce	 phagocyte	 activation,	
antibody-dependent	 cellular	 cytotoxicity,	 and	 complement-mediated	
damage.	 It	 is	 possible,	 therefore,	 that	 the	 role	 of	 IgG4	 in	 this	 disease	
is	 actually	 as	 a	 counterregulatory	 mechanism	 rather	 than	 part	 of	 the	
primary	inflammatory	process.

Next-generation	 sequencing	 studies	 of	 CD4+	 effector	 T	 cells	 have	
demonstrated	a	unique	CD4+	cytotoxic	T	cell.	This	cell,	also	found	in	
abundance	at	tissue	sites	of	disease,	makes	interferon	γ,	T-cell	growth	
factor-β,	 and	 interleukin-1,	 all	 of	 which	 may	 contribute	 to	 the	 stori-
form	fibrosis	found	in	this	condition.	The	cells	also	elaborate	perforin,	
granzyme	A	and	B,	and	granulysin,	products	capable	of	inducing	cyto-
toxicity.	The	pronounced	oligoclonal	expansion	of	this	CD4+	cytotoxic	
T	cell	at	tissue	sites	suggests	that	this	cell	is	a	major	disease	driver.

Oligoclonal	expansions	of	plasmablasts	are	also	present	within	the	
blood	of	patients	with	IgG4-RD.	Continuous	antigen	presentation	by	
B	cells	and	plasmablasts	may	support	this	cell,	which	in	turn	produces	
profibrotic	cytokines	and	other	molecules,	thereby	directly	mediating	
tissue	injury.

 ■ TREATMENT
Vital	organ	involvement	must	be	treated	aggressively	because	IgG4-RD	
can	lead	to	serious	organ	dysfunction	and	failure.	Aggressive	disease	
can	lead	quickly	to	end-stage	liver	disease,	permanent	impairment	of	
pancreatic	function,	renal	atrophy,	aortic	dissection	or	aneurysms,	and	
destructive	lesions	in	the	sinuses	and	nasopharynx.	Not	every	disease	
manifestation	 of	 IgG4-RD	 requires	 immediate	 treatment,	 however,	
because	 the	 disease	 may	 take	 an	 indolent	 form	 in	 some	 patients.	
IgG4-related	 lymphadenopathy,	 for	 example,	 can	 be	 asymptomatic	
for	 years,	 without	 evolution	 to	 other	 disease	 manifestations.	 Thus,	
watchful	waiting	is	prudent	in	some	cases,	but	monitoring	is	essential	
because	serious	organ	involvement	may	evolve	over	time.

Glucocorticoids	 are	 the	 first	 line	 of	 therapy.	 Treatment	 regimens,	
extrapolated	 from	 experience	 with	 the	 management	 of	 type	 1	 AIP,	
generally	 begin	 with	 40	 mg/d	 of	 prednisone,	 with	 tapering	 to	 dis-
continuation	or	maintenance	doses	of	5	mg/d	within	2	or	3	months.	
Although	the	clinical	response	to	glucocorticoids	is	usually	swift	and	
striking,	prolonged	steroid-free	remissions	are	uncommon	and	the	risk	
of	 steroid-induced	 morbidity	 in	 this	 middle-aged	 to	 elderly	 patient	
population	 is	 high,	 particularly	 in	 those	 with	 baseline	 comorbidities	
and	pancreatic	involvement	by	IgG4-RD.	Few	data	exist	to	support	the	
utility	of	conventional	steroid-sparing	agents	in	this	disease.

For	 patients	 with	 relapsing	 or	 glucocorticoid-resistant	 disease,	
B-cell	 depletion	 with	 rituximab	 is	 an	 excellent	 second-line	 therapy.	
Rituximab	treatment	(two	doses	of	1	g	IV,	separated	by	approximately		
15	days)	leads	to	a	swift	decline	in	serum	IgG4	concentrations,	suggest-
ing	that	rituximab	achieves	its	effects	in	part	by	preventing	the	repletion	
of	short-lived	plasma	cells	that	produce	IgG4.	More	important	than	its	
effects	 on	 IgG4	 concentrations,	 however,	 may	 be	 the	 effect	 of	 B-cell	
depletion	on	T-cell	function.	Specific	effects	of	rituximab	on	the	CD4+	
cytotoxic	T	cell	described	above	have	been	documented	in	IgG4-RD.	
Rituximab	may	be	an	appropriate	first-line	therapy	for	some	patients,	
particularly	those	at	high	risk	for	glucocorticoid	toxicity	and	patients	
with	 immediately	 organ-threatening	 disease.	 The	 rapidly	 evolving	
understanding	 of	 the	 pathophysiology	 of	 IgG4-RD	 suggests	 several	
novel	 targeted	 approaches	 to	 treating	 the	 disease,	 some	 of	 which	 are	
in	clinical	trials.	These	novel	strategies	include	inhibition	of	Bruton’s	
tyrosine	 kinase,	 the	 depletion	 of	 CD19+	 cells	 of	 the	 B	 lymphocyte	
lineage,	and	targeting	of	SLAM-F7,	the	molecule	found	on	the	surfaces	
of	both	B	lymphocytes	and	the	CD4+	cytotoxic	T	lymphocyte.	Both	of	
these	cell	types	have	been	implicated	in	disease	pathophysiology.

369 Familial Mediterranean  
Fever and Other  
Hereditary Autoinflammatory 
Diseases
Daniel L. Kastner

Familial	 Mediterranean	 fever	 (FMF)	 is	 the	 prototype	 of	 a	 group	 of	
inherited	 diseases	 (Table  369-1)	 that	 are	 characterized	 by	 recurrent	
episodes	 of	 fever	 with	 serosal,	 synovial,	 or	 cutaneous	 inflammation	
and,	 in	 some	 individuals,	 the	 eventual	 development	 of	 systemic	 AA	
amyloidosis	(Chap. 112).	Because	of	the	relative	infrequency	of	high-
titer	 autoantibodies	 or	 antigen-specific	 T	 cells,	 the	 term	 autoinflam-
matory	 has	 been	 proposed	 to	 describe	 these	 disorders,	 rather	 than	
autoimmune.	 The	 innate	 immune	 system,	 with	 its	 myeloid	 effector	
cells	 and	 germline	 receptors	 for	 pathogen-associated	 molecular	 pat-
terns	and	endogenous	danger	signals,	plays	a	predominant	role	in	the	
pathogenesis	 of	 the	 autoinflammatory	 diseases.	 Although	 the	 hered-
itary	 recurrent	 fevers	 comprise	 a	 major	 category	 of	 the	 autoinflam-
matory	 diseases,	 other	 inherited	 disorders	 of	 inflammation	 in	 which	
recurrent	fever	plays	a	less	prominent	role	are	now	also	considered	to	
be	autoinflammatory.

BACKGROUND AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
FMF	 was	 first	 recognized	 among	 Armenians,	 Arabs,	 Turks,	 and	
non-Ashkenazi	 (primarily	 North	 African	 and	 Iraqi)	 Jews.	 With	 the	
advent	of	genetic	testing,	FMF	has	been	documented	with	increasing	
frequency	 among	 Ashkenazi	 Jews,	 Italians,	 and	 other	 Mediterranean	
populations,	 and	 occasional	 cases	 have	 been	 confirmed	 even	 in	 the	
absence	of	known	Mediterranean	ancestry.	FMF	is	generally	regarded	
as	recessively	inherited,	but	there	is	an	increasing	awareness	of	clear-
cut	 clinical	 cases	 with	 only	 a	 single	 demonstrable	 genetic	 mutation,	
and	for	certain	relatively	rare	FMF	mutations,	there	is	strong	evidence	
for	dominant	inheritance.	Particularly	in	countries	where	families	are	
small,	a	positive	family	history	can	only	be	elicited	in	~50%	of	cases.	
DNA	testing	demonstrates	carrier	frequencies	as	high	as	1:10	among	
affected	populations,	most	likely	due	to	some	selective	advantage.

The	FMF	gene	encodes	a	781-amino-acid,	~95-kDa	protein	denoted	
pyrin	that	is	expressed	in	granulocytes,	eosinophils,	monocytes,	den-

and	IL-18	secretion	and	gasdermin	d-mediated	cell	death	(pyroptosis).	
Certain	bacterial	toxins	that	block	leukocyte	cytoskeletal	assembly	by	
inactivating	 RhoA	 GTPase	 trigger	 pyrin	 inflammasome	 activation	 as	
a	part	of	the	normal	host	defense;	in	FMF	patients,	the	threshold	for	
pyrin	 inflammasome	 activation	 is	 reduced.	 Population	 genetic	 and	
immune	functional	studies	support	a	role	for	bubonic	plague	pandem-
ics	in	selecting	for	FMF	founder	mutations	that	had	arisen	in	Biblical	
times	in	the	Middle	East.

ACUTE ATTACKS
Febrile	 episodes	 in	 FMF	 may	 begin	 even	 in	 early	 infancy;	 90%	 of	
patients	 have	 had	 their	 first	 attack	 by	 age	 20.	 Typical	 FMF	 episodes	
generally	last	24–72	h,	with	arthritic	attacks	tending	to	last	somewhat	
longer.	In	some	patients,	the	episodes	occur	with	great	regularity,	but	
more	often,	the	frequency	of	attacks	varies	over	time,	ranging	from	as	
often	as	once	every	few	days	to	remissions	lasting	several	years.	Attacks	
are	often	unpredictable,	although	some	patients	relate	them	to	physical	
exertion,	 emotional	 stress,	 or	 menses;	 pregnancy	 may	 be	 associated	
with	remission.

If	measured,	fever	is	nearly	always	present	throughout	FMF	attacks.	
Severe	hyperpyrexia	and	even	febrile	seizures	may	be	seen	in	infants,	
and	fever	is	sometimes	the	only	manifestation	of	FMF	in	young	children.
Over	 90%	 of	 FMF	 patients	 experience	 abdominal	 attacks	 at	 some	
time.	 Episodes	 range	 in	 severity	 from	 dull,	 aching	 pain	 and	 disten-
tion	 with	 mild	 tenderness	 on	 direct	 palpation	 to	 severe	 generalized	

pain	 with	 absent	 bowel	 sounds,	 rigidity,	 rebound	 tenderness,	 and	
air-fluid	 levels	 on	 upright	 radiographs.	 Computed	 tomography	 (CT)	
scanning	may	demonstrate	a	small	amount	of	fluid	in	the	abdominal	
cavity.	If	such	patients	undergo	exploratory	laparotomy,	a	sterile,	neu-
trophil-rich	 peritoneal	 exudate	 is	 present,	 sometimes	 with	 adhesions	
from	previous	episodes.	Ascites	is	rare.

Pleural	attacks	are	usually	manifested	by	unilateral,	sharp,	stabbing	
chest	pain.	Radiographs	may	show	atelectasis	and	sometimes	an	effu-
sion.	If	performed,	thoracentesis	demonstrates	an	exudative	fluid	rich	
in	neutrophils.	After	repeated	attacks,	pleural	thickening	may	develop.
FMF	arthritis	is	most	frequent	among	individuals	homozygous	for	the	
M694V	mutation,	which	is	especially	common	in	the	non-Ashkenazi	Jew-
ish	population.	Acute	arthritis	in	FMF	is	usually	monoarticular,	affect-
ing	the	knee,	ankle,	or	hip,	although	other	patterns	can	be	seen.	Large	
sterile	effusions	rich	in	neutrophils	are	frequent,	without	commensurate	
erythema	or	warmth.	Even	after	repeated	arthritic	attacks,	radiographic	
changes	 are	 rare.	 Before	 the	 advent	 of	 colchicine	 prophylaxis,	 chronic	
arthritis	of	the	knee	or	hip	was	seen	in	~5%	of	FMF	patients	with	arthri-
tis.	Chronic	sacroiliitis	can	occur	in	FMF	irrespective	of	the	HLA-B27	
antigen,	even	in	the	face	of	colchicine	therapy.	In	the	United	States,	FMF	
patients	are	much	more	likely	to	have	arthralgia	than	arthritis.

The	most	characteristic	cutaneous	manifestation	of	FMF	is	erysipelas-
like	erythema,	a	raised	erythematous	rash	that	most	commonly	occurs	on	
the	dorsum	of	the	foot,	ankle,	or	lower	leg	alone	or	in	combination	with	
abdominal	 pain,	 pleurisy,	 or	 arthritis.	 Biopsy	 demonstrates	 perivascular

2842 infiltrates	of	granulocytes	and	monocytes.	This	rash	is	seen	most	often	in	

M694V	homozygotes	and	is	relatively	rare	in	the	United	States.

Exercise-induced	 (nonfebrile)	 myalgia	 is	 common	 in	 FMF,	 and	
a	 small	 percentage	 of	 patients	 develop	 a	 protracted	 febrile	 myalgia	
that	 can	 last	 several	 weeks.	 Symptomatic	 pericardial	 disease	 is	 rare,	
although	small	pericardial	effusions	may	be	noted	on	echocardiogra-
phy.	 Unilateral	 acute	 scrotal	 inflammation	 may	 occur	 in	 prepubertal	
boys.	Aseptic	meningitis	has	been	reported	in	FMF,	but	the	causal	con-
nection	is	controversial.	Vasculitis,	including	Henoch-Schönlein	pur-
pura	and	polyarteritis	nodosa	(Chap. 363),	may	be	seen	at	increased	
frequency	in	FMF.	The	M694V	FMF	mutation	has	been	shown	to	be	a	
risk	factor	for	Behçet’s	disease	and	ankylosing	spondylitis.

Laboratory	 features	 of	 FMF	 attacks	 are	 consistent	 with	 acute	
inflammation	and	include	an	elevated	erythrocyte	sedimentation	rate,	
leukocytosis,	 thrombocytosis	 (in	 children),	 and	 elevations	 in	 C-reactive	
protein,	fibrinogen,	haptoglobin,	and	serum	immunoglobulins.	Transient	
albuminuria	and	hematuria	may	also	be	seen.

AMYLOIDOSIS
Before	the	advent	of	colchicine	prophylaxis,	systemic	amyloidosis	was	a	
common	complication	of	FMF.	It	is	caused	by	deposition	of	a	fragment	
of	serum	amyloid	A,	an	acute-phase	reactant,	in	the	kidneys,	adrenals,	
intestine,	spleen,	lung,	and	testes	(Chap. 112).	Amyloidosis	should	be	
suspected	in	patients	who	have	proteinuria	between	attacks;	renal	or	
rectal	biopsy	is	used	most	often	to	establish	the	diagnosis.	Risk	factors	
include	 the	 M694V	 homozygous	 genotype,	 positive	 family	 history	
(independent	 of	 FMF	 mutational	 status),	 the	 SAA1	 genotype,	 male	
gender,	noncompliance	with	colchicine	or	IL-1	inhibitory	therapy,	and	
having	grown	up	in	the	Middle	East.

DIAGNOSIS
For	 typical	 cases,	 physicians	 experienced	 with	 FMF	 can	 often	 make	
the	diagnosis	on	clinical	grounds	alone.	Clinical	criteria	sets	for	FMF	
have	been	shown	to	have	high	sensitivity	and	specificity	in	parts	of	the	
world	 where	 the	 pretest	 probability	 of	 FMF	 is	 high.	 Genetic	 testing	
can	provide	a	useful	adjunct	in	ambiguous	cases	or	for	physicians	not	
experienced	in	FMF.	Most	of	the	more	severe	disease-associated	FMF	
mutations	 are	 in	 exon	 10	 of	 the	 gene.	 An	 updated	 list	 of	 mutations	
for	FMF	and	other	hereditary	recurrent	fevers	can	be	found	online	at	
http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/infevers/.

Genetic	testing	has	permitted	a	broadening	of	the	clinical	spectrum	
and	 geographic	 distribution	 of	 FMF	 and	 may	 be	 of	 prognostic	 value.	
Most	 studies	 indicate	 that	 M694V	 homozygotes	 have	 an	 earlier	 age	
of	onset	and	a	higher	frequency	of	arthritis,	rash,	and	amyloidosis.	In	
contrast,	the	E148Q	variant	in	exon	2	is	quite	common	in	certain	Asian	
populations	 and	 is	 more	 likely	 to	 affect	 overall	 levels	 of	 inflammation	
than	to	cause	clinical	FMF.	E148Q	is	sometimes	found	in	cis	with	exon	
10	 mutations,	 which	 may	 complicate	 the	 interpretation	 of	 genetic	 test	
results.	Only	~70%	of	patients	with	clinically	typical	FMF	have	two	iden-
tifiable	mutations	in	trans,	consistent	with	the	concept	that	FMF	muta-
tions	are	gain-of-function	with	regard	to	inflammasome	activation,	with	
a	dosage	effect.	In	those	cases	in	which	only	a	single	mutation	is	identi-
fied,	clinical	judgment	is	very	important,	and	sometimes	a	therapeutic	
trial	of	colchicine	or	an	IL-1	inhibitor	may	help	to	confirm	the	diagnosis.
If	a	patient	is	seen	during	his	or	her	first	attack,	the	differential	diag-
nosis	may	be	broad,	although	delimited	by	the	specific	organ	involve-
ment.	After	several	attacks,	the	differential	diagnosis	may	include	the	
other	 hereditary	 recurrent	 fever	 syndromes	 (Table	 362-1);	 the	 syn-
drome	of	periodic	fever	with	aphthous	ulcers,	pharyngitis,	and	cervical	
adenopathy	(PFAPA);	systemic-onset	juvenile	rheumatoid	arthritis	or	
adult	 Still’s	 disease;	 porphyria;	 hereditary	 angioedema;	 inflammatory	
bowel	disease;	and,	in	women,	gynecologic	disorders.

TREATMENT
Familial Mediterranean Fever

The	 initial	 treatment	 of	 choice	 for	 FMF	 is	 daily	 oral	 colchicine,	
which	decreases	the	frequency	and	intensity	of	attacks	and	prevents	
the	development	of	amyloidosis	in	compliant	patients.	Intermittent	

dosing	at	the	onset	of	attacks	is	not	as	effective	as	daily	prophylaxis	
and	is	of	unproven	value	in	preventing	amyloidosis.	The	usual	adult	
dose	of	colchicine	is	1.2–1.8	mg/d,	which	causes	substantial	reduc-
tion	in	symptoms	in	two-thirds	of	patients	and	some	improvement	
in	>90%.	Children	may	require	lower	doses,	although	not	propor-
tionately	to	body	weight.

Common	side	effects	of	colchicine	include	bloating,	abdominal	
cramps,	lactose	intolerance,	and	diarrhea.	They	can	be	minimized	
by	 starting	 at	 a	 low	 dose	 and	 gradually	 advancing	 as	 tolerated,	
splitting	the	dose,	use	of	simethicone	for	flatulence,	and	avoidance	
of	dairy	products.	If	taken	by	either	parent	at	the	time	of	concep-
tion,	 colchicine	 may	 cause	 a	 small	 increase	 in	 the	 risk	 of	 trisomy	
21	 (Down’s	 syndrome).	 Colchicine	 is	 usually	 continued	 during	
pregnancy,	 because	 the	 risk	 of	 miscarriage	 due	 to	 FMF	 attacks	
is	 thought	 to	 outweigh	 any	 effect	 of	 colchicine	 on	 fetal	 develop-
ment.	 In	 elderly	 patients	 with	 renal	 insufficiency,	 colchicine	 can	
cause	a	myoneuropathy	characterized	by	proximal	muscle	weakness	
and	elevation	of	the	creatine	kinase.	Cyclosporine	inhibits	hepatic	
excretion	of	colchicine	by	its	effects	on	the	multidrug	resistance	1	
(MDR1)	transport	system,	sometimes	leading	to	colchicine	toxicity	
in	patients	who	have	undergone	renal	transplantation	for	amyloido-
sis.	Intravenous	colchicine	should	generally	not	be	administered	to	
patients	already	taking	oral	colchicine,	because	severe,	sometimes	
fatal,	toxicity	has	been	observed	in	this	setting.

For	 FMF	 patients	 who	 do	 not	 respond	 to	 colchicine	 or	 can-
not	 tolerate	 therapeutic	 doses,	 injectable	 IL-1	 inhibitors	 may	 be	
used.	Based	on	a	randomized	placebo-controlled	phase	3	trial,	the	
monoclonal	anti-IL-1β	antibody	canakinumab	received	U.S.	Food	
and	Drug	Administration	(FDA)	approval	for	this	indication.	In	a	
small	 randomized	 placebo-controlled	 trial,	 weekly	 subcutaneous	
rilonacept,	a	recombinant	IL-1	receptor	fusion	protein,	significantly	
reduced	the	frequency	of	attacks.	There	is	also	substantial	anecdotal	
experience	with	daily	subcutaneous	anakinra,	a	recombinant	IL-1	
receptor	antagonist,	in	preventing	the	acute	attacks	of	FMF	and,	in	
some	 cases,	 reducing	 established	 amyloid	 deposits.	 Bone	 marrow	
transplantation	 has	 been	 suggested	 for	 refractory	 FMF,	 but	 the	
risk-benefit	ratio	is	currently	regarded	as	unacceptable.

OTHER HEREDITARY RECURRENT FEVERS
 ■ TNF RECEPTOR–ASSOCIATED  
PERIODIC SYNDROME
Tumor	 necrosis	 factor	 (TNF)	 receptor–associated	 periodic	 syndrome	
(TRAPS)	is	caused	by	dominantly	inherited	mutations	in	the	extracel-
lular	 domains	 of	 the	 55-kDa	 TNF	 receptor	 (TNFR1,	 p55).	 Although	
originally	described	in	a	large	Irish	family	(and	hence	the	name	familial 
Hibernian fever),	TRAPS	has	a	broad	ethnic	distribution.	TRAPS	epi-
sodes	often	begin	in	childhood.	The	duration	of	attacks	ranges	from	
1	to	2	days	to	as	long	as	several	weeks,	and	in	severe	cases,	symptoms	
may	be	nearly	continuous.	In	addition	to	peritoneal,	pleural,	and	syno-
vial	 attacks	 similar	 to	 FMF,	 TRAPS	 patients	 frequently	 have	 ocular	
inflammation	 (most	 often	 conjunctivitis	 and/or	 periorbital	 edema),	
and	 a	 distinctive	 migratory	 myalgia	 with	 overlying	 painful	 erythema	
may	 be	 present.	 TRAPS	 patients	 generally	 respond	 better	 to	 gluco-
corticoids	 than	 to	 prophylactic	 colchicine.	 Untreated,	 ~15%	 develop	
amyloidosis.	The	diagnosis	of	TRAPS	is	based	on	the	demonstration	
of	a	TNFRSF1A	mutation	in	the	presence	of	characteristic	symptoms.	
Two	particular	variants,	R92Q	and	P46L,	are	common	in	certain	pop-
ulations	and	may	act	more	as	functional	polymorphisms	than	as	dis-
ease-causing	mutations.	In	contrast,	pathogenic	TNFRSF1A	mutations,	
including	a	number	of	substitutions	at	highly	conserved	cysteine	resi-
dues,	are	associated	with	intracellular	TNFR1	misfolding,	aggregation,	
and	retention,	with	consequent	ligand-independent	kinase	activation,	
mitochondrial	reactive	oxygen	species	production,	and	proinflamma-
tory	cytokine	release.	Etanercept,	a	TNF	inhibitor,	ameliorates	TRAPS	
attacks,	 but	 the	 long-term	 experience	 with	 this	 agent	 has	 been	 less	
favorable.	 IL-1	 inhibition	 has	 been	 beneficial	 in	 a	 large	 percentage	
of	the	patients	in	whom	it	has	been	used,	and	canakinumab	recently

anti-TNF	antibodies	should	be	avoided,	because	they	may	exacerbate	
TRAPS	attacks.
 ■ HYPERIMMUNOGLOBULINEMIA D WITH 
PERIODIC FEVER SYNDROME (ALSO KNOWN AS 
MEVALONATE KINASE DEFICIENCY)
Hyperimmunoglobulinemia	 D	 with	 periodic	 fever	 syndrome	 (HIDS)	
is	a	recessively	inherited	recurrent	fever	syndrome	found	primarily	in	
individuals	of	northern	European	ancestry.	It	is	caused	by	mutations	in	
mevalonate	kinase	(MVK),	encoding	an	enzyme	involved	in	the	synthe-
sis	 of	 cholesterol	 and	 nonsterol	 isoprenoids,	 including	 geranylgeranyl	
pyrophosphate.	The	latter	compound	is	essential	for	proper	localization	
of	RhoA	GTPase	to	the	cell	membrane,	and	the	mislocalization	of	RhoA	
leads	 to	 its	 inactivation	 and	 the	 consequent	 activation	 of	 the	 pyrin	
inflammasome.	HIDS	attacks	usually	begin	in	infancy	and	last	3–5	days.	
Clinically	distinctive	features	include	painful	cervical	adenopathy,	a	dif-
fuse	maculopapular	rash	sometimes	affecting	the	palms	and	soles,	and	
aphthous	ulcers;	pleurisy	is	rare.	Amyloidosis	has	been	observed	associ-
ated	with	the	V377I/I268T	MVK	genotype.	Although	originally	defined	
by	the	persistent	elevation	of	serum	IgD,	disease	activity	is	not	related	to	
IgD	levels,	and	some	patients	with	FMF	or	TRAPS	may	have	modestly	
increased	serum	IgD.	Moreover,	occasional	patients	with	MVK	muta-
tions	and	recurrent	fever	have	normal	IgD	levels,	while	all	patients	with	
mutations	 have	 markedly	 elevated	 urinary	 mevalonate	 levels	 during	
their	attacks.	For	these	reasons,	some	have	proposed	renaming	this	dis-
order	mevalonate kinase deficiency	(MKD).	Canakinumab	was	recently	
approved	by	the	FDA	for	the	treatment	of	HIDS/MKD.
 ■ NLRP3-ASSOCIATED AUTOINFLAMMATORY 
DISEASE (ALSO KNOWN AS THE 
CRYOPYRINOPATHIES OR CRYOPYRIN-ASSOCIATED 
PERIODIC SYNDROMES)
Three	 hereditary	 febrile	 syndromes,	 familial	 cold	 autoinflammatory	
syndrome	 (FCAS),	 Muckle-Wells	 syndrome	 (MWS),	 and	 neonatal-	
onset	multisystem	inflammatory	disease	(NOMID),	are	all	caused	by	
mutations	 in	 NLRP3	 (formerly	 known	 as	 CIAS1),	 the	 gene	 encoding	
cryopyrin	 (or	 NLRP3),	 and	 represent	 a	 clinical	 spectrum	 of	 disease.	
FCAS	patients	develop	chills,	fever,	headache,	arthralgia,	conjunctivitis,	
and	an	urticaria-like	rash	in	response	to	generalized	cold	exposure.	In	
MWS,	an	urticarial	rash	is	noted,	but	it	is	not	usually	induced	by	cold;	
MWS	patients	also	develop	fevers,	abdominal	pain,	limb	pain,	arthritis,	
conjunctivitis,	 and,	 over	 time,	 sensorineural	 hearing	 loss.	 NOMID	 is	
the	most	severe	of	the	three	disorders,	with	chronic	aseptic	meningitis,	
a	 characteristic	 arthropathy,	 and	 rash.	 Like	 the	 FMF	 protein	 pyrin,	
cryopyrin	has	an	N-terminal	PYRIN	domain,	allowing	the	formation	
of	an	NLRP3 inflammasome	that	mediates	caspase-1	activation,	IL-1β	
and	 IL-18	 release,	 and	 pyroptosis.	 Peripheral	 blood	 leukocytes	 from	
patients	with	FCAS,	MWS,	and	NOMID	release	increased	amounts	of	
IL-1β	 upon	 in	 vitro	 stimulation,	 relative	 to	 healthy	 controls.	 Macro-
phages	from	cryopyrin-deficient	mice	exhibit	decreased	IL-1β	produc-
tion	in	response	to	certain	gram-positive	bacteria,	bacterial	RNA,	and	
monosodium	urate	crystals.	Patients	with	all	three	cryopyrinopathies	
or	cryopyrin-associated	periodic	syndromes	(CAPS)	show	a	dramatic	
response	to	injections	of	IL-1	inhibitors.	Canakinumab	and	rilonacept	
are	approved	by	the	FDA	for	the	treatment	of	FCAS	and	MWS,	whereas	
anakinra	is	approved	for	the	treatment	of	NOMID.

Approximately	one-third	of	patients	with	clinical	manifestations	of	
NOMID	do	not	have	germline	mutations	in	NLRP3,	but	they	have	been	
found	to	be	mosaic	for	somatic	NLRP3	mutations.	Such	patients	also	
respond	dramatically	to	IL-1	inhibition.	Somatic	mosaicism	in	NLRP3	
has	 been	 reported	 rarely	 in	 Schnitzler’s	 syndrome,	 which	 presents	 in	
middle	 age	 with	 recurrent	 fever,	 urticarial	 rash,	 elevated	 acute-phase	
reactants,	monoclonal	IgM	gammopathy,	and	abnormal	bone	remodel-
ing.	IL-1	inhibition	is	the	treatment	of	choice	for	Schnitzler’s	syndrome.
 ■ PERIODIC FEVER WITH APHTHOUS STOMATITIS, 
PHARYNGITIS, AND CERVICAL ADENITIS
Periodic	fever	with	aphthous	stomatitis,	pharyngitis,	and	cervical	aden-
itis	(PFAPA)	is	the	most	common	periodic	fever	syndrome	in	children,	

notable	 for	 the	 almost	 clock-like	 regularity	 of	 episodes	 and	 the	 ten-
dency	for	resolution	of	attacks	by	early	adulthood.	PFAPA	tends	to	run	
in	families,	but	not	in	a	Mendelian	fashion.	Recent	studies	indicate	that	
common	shared	variants	in	the	IL12A,	IL10,	STAT4,	and	CCR1-CCR3	
loci	 confer	 susceptibility	 for	 a	 spectrum	 of	 phenotypes	 ranging	 from	
common	 aphthous	 ulcers	 to	 PFAPA	 to	 Behçet’s	 disease.	 Therapeutic	
options	 for	 PFAPA	 include	 intermittent	 glucocorticoids;	 daily	 oral	
colchicine,	cimetidine,	or	apremilast;	or	tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy.

OTHER INHERITED AUTOINFLAMMATORY 
DISEASES
There	 are	 a	 number	 of	 other	 Mendelian	 autoinflammatory	 diseases	
in	 which	 recurrent	 fevers	 are	 not	 a	 prominent	 clinical	 sign	 but	 that	
involve	 abnormalities	 of	 innate	 immunity.	 The	 syndrome	 of	 pyo-
genic	 arthritis	 with	 pyoderma	 gangrenosum	 and	 acne	 (PAPA)	 is	 a	
dominantly	 inherited	 disorder	 that	 presents	 with	 episodes	 of	 sterile	
pyogenic	 monoarthritis	 often	 induced	 by	 trauma,	 severe	 pyoderma	
gangrenosum,	and	severe	cystic	acne	usually	beginning	in	puberty.	It	is	
caused	by	mutations	in	PSTPIP1,	which	encodes	a	pyrin-binding	pro-
tein,	and	the	arthritic	manifestations	often	respond	to	IL-1	inhibition.	
Dominantly	 inherited	 gain-of-function	 mutations	 in	 NLRC4	 lead	 to	
increased	 IL-1	 and	 IL-18	 production	 and	 potentially	 life-threatening	
recurrent	macrophage	activation	syndrome.

Whereas	 the	 aforementioned	 disorders	 all	 involve	 mutations	 in	
IL-1-related	molecules,	other	autoinflammatory	diseases	are	caused	by	
mutations	 in	 other	 components	 of	 innate	 immunity.	 Blau’s  syndrome	
is	 caused	 by	 mutations	 in	 CARD15	 (also	 known	 as	 NOD2),	 which	
regulates	nuclear	factor	κB	activation.	Blau’s	syndrome	is	characterized	
by	 granulomatous	 dermatitis,	 uveitis,	 and	 arthritis;	 distinct	 CARD15	
variants	 predispose	 to	 Crohn’s	 disease.	 Recessive	 mutations	 in	 one	
or	 more	 components	 of	 the	 proteasome	 lead	 to	 excessive	 interferon	
signaling	 and	 a	 severe	 form	 of	 generalized	 panniculitis.	 De	 novo	
gain-of-function	mutations	in	TMEM173,	encoding	the	stimulator	of	
interferon	genes	(STING),	cause	severe	vasculopathy	and	pulmonary	
fibrosis.	 Recessive	 loss-of-function	 mutations	 in	 the	 gene	 encoding	
adenosine	deaminase	2	(ADA2)	cause	a	vasculopathy	that	can	manifest	
as	 livedoid	 rash,	 early-onset	 lacunar	 strokes,	 or	 polyarteritis	 nodosa,	
often	 responsive	 to	 TNF	 inhibition.	 Mutations	 in	 the	 gene	 encoding	
the	A20	ubiquitin-modifying	enzyme	cause	a	Behçet’s-like	monogenic	
illness	 (“HA20”),	 whereas	 mutations	 in	 a	 different	 deubiquitinase	
(OTULIN)	cause	a	form	of	panniculitis	(“otulipenia”).	Mutations	at	the	
site	where	RIPK1	is	inactivated	by	caspase-8	cause	a	condition	mani-
festing	recurrent	fevers,	painful	lymphadenopathy,	and	organomegaly,	
denoted	 CRIA	 (cleavage-resistant	 RIPK1-induced	 autoinflammatory)	
syndrome,	that	may	respond	to	IL-6	inhibition.

Finally,	 it	 should	 be	 noted	 that	 a	 number	 of	 common,	 genetically	
complex	 disorders	 are	 now	 sometimes	 considered	 autoinflammatory,	
because	 of	 evidence	 that	 components	 of	 the	 innate	 immune	 system,	
such	as	the	inflammasome,	may	play	a	role	in	the	pathogenesis.	Two	
prominent	 examples	 are	 gout	 and	 atherosclerosis.	 Myeloid-restricted	
somatic	mutations	in	an	essential	ubiquitylation	enzyme	have	recently	
been	 implicated	 in	 a	 severe	 adult-onset	 autoinflammatory	 disease	
termed	 VEXAS	 (vacuoles,	 E1	 enzyme,	 X-linked,	 autoinflammatory,	
somatic)	 syndrome,	 which	 can	 present	 as	 relapsing	 polychondritis,	
vasculitis,	or	myelodysplastic	syndrome.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
All	the	disorders	discussed	in	this	chapter	have	been	observed	in	mul-
tiple	 populations.	 However,	 as	 noted	 herein,	 FMF	 is	 most	 frequently	
observed	in	Mediterranean	and	Middle	Eastern	populations	and	HIDS	
in	northern	European	populations,	particularly	the	Dutch.	A	recessive	
founder	 mutation	 in	 ADA2	 is	 particularly	 common	 in	 the	 Georgian	
Jewish	population	and	is	associated	with	polyarteritis	nodosa.

Section 3  Disorders of the Joints and 
Adjacent Tissues

370 Approach to Articular 
and Musculoskeletal 
Disorders
John J. Cush

Musculoskeletal	complaints	account	for	>315	million	outpatient	visits	
per	 year	 and	 >20%	 of	 all	 outpatient	 visits	 in	 the	 United	 States.	 The	
Centers	for	Disease	Control	and	Prevention	estimate	that	58.5	million	
(or	1	in	4	adults)	of	the	U.S.	population	has	physician-diagnosed	arthri-
tis.	 While	 many	 patients	 will	 have	 self-limited	 conditions	 requiring	
minimal	 evaluation,	 reassurance,	 and	 symptomatic	 therapy,	 specific	
musculoskeletal	presentations	or	their	persistence	may	herald	a	more	
serious	condition	that	requires	further	evaluation	or	laboratory	testing	
to	 establish	 a	 diagnosis.	 The	 goal	 of	 the	 musculoskeletal	 evaluation	
is	to	formulate	a	differential	diagnosis	that	leads	to	an	accurate	diag-
nosis	 and	 timely	 therapy,	 while	 avoiding	 excessive	 diagnostic	 testing	
and	 unnecessary	 treatment	 (Table  370-1).	 There	 are	 several	 urgent	
conditions	 that	 must	 be	 diagnosed	 promptly	 to	 avoid	 damage	
and	 morbidity.	 These	 “red	 flag”	 diagnoses	 include	 septic	 arthritis,	
acute	crystal-induced	arthritis	(e.g.,	gout),	and	fracture.	Each	may	be	

TABLE 370-1  Evaluation of Patients with Musculoskeletal Complaints
Goals
  Accurate diagnosis
  Timely provision of therapy
  Avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic testing

Identification of acute, focal/monarticular “red flag” conditions

Approach
  Determine the chronology (acute vs chronic)

 Determine the nature of the pathologic process (inflammatory vs 
noninflammatory)
 Determine the extent of involvement (monarticular, polyarticular, focal, 
widespread)

  Anatomic localization of complaint (articular vs nonarticular)
  Consider the most common disorders first
  Consider the need for diagnostic testing
  Formulate a differential diagnosis

suspected	by	an	acute	onset	and	monarticular	or	focal	musculoskeletal	
pain.

The	majority	of	individuals	with	musculoskeletal	complaints	can	be	
diagnosed	with	a	thorough	history	and	a	comprehensive	physical	and	
musculoskeletal	examination.	The	initial	encounter	should	determine	
whether	 the	 musculoskeletal	 complaint	 signals	 a	 red	 flag	 condition	
(septic	arthritis,	gout,	or	fracture)	or	not.	The	evaluation	should	ascer-
tain	if	the	complaint	is	(1)	articular	or	nonarticular,	(2)	inflammatory	
or	noninflammatory,	(3)	acute	or	chronic,	and	(4)	localized (monarticu-
lar)	or	widespread	(polyarticular).

With	this	approach,	the	musculoskeletal	presentation	can	be	char-
acterized	 (e.g.,	 acute	 inflammatory	 monarthritis	 or	 a	 chronic	 nonin-
flammatory,	 nonarticular	 widespread	 pain)	 to	 narrow	 the	 diagnostic	
possibilities.	However,	some	patients	will	not	fit	immediately	into	an	
established	 diagnostic	 category.	 Many	 musculoskeletal	 disorders	
resemble	each	other	at	the	outset,	and	some	may	take	weeks	or	months	
(but	not	years)	to	evolve	into	a	recognizable	diagnostic	entity.	This	con-
sideration	should	temper	the	desire	to	establish	a	definitive	diagnosis	
at	the	first	encounter.

ARTICULAR VERSUS NONARTICULAR
The	musculoskeletal	evaluation	must	discriminate	the	anatomic	orig-
in(s)	of	the	patient’s	complaint.	For	example,	ankle	pain	can	result	from	
a	variety	of	pathologic	conditions	involving	disparate	anatomic	struc-
tures,	including	gouty	arthritis,	calcaneal	fracture,	Achilles	tendinitis,	
plantar	 fasciitis,	 cellulitis,	 and	 peripheral	 or	 entrapment	 neuropathy.	
Distinguishing	between	articular	and	nonarticular	conditions	requires	
a	 careful	 and	 detailed	 examination.	 Articular	 structures	 include	 the	
synovium,	 synovial	 fluid,	 articular	 cartilage,	 intraarticular	 ligaments,	
joint	capsule,	and	juxtaarticular	bone.	Nonarticular	(or	periarticular)	
structures,	 such	 as	 supportive	 extraarticular	 ligaments,	 tendons,	 bur-
sae,	muscle,	fascia,	bone,	nerve,	and	overlying	skin,	may	be	involved	
in	 the	 pathologic	 process.	 Although	 musculoskeletal	 complaints	 are	
often	ascribed	to	the	joints,	nonarticular	disorders	are	more	frequent	
and	are	often	confused	with	arthritis.	Distinguishing	between	articular	
and	 nonarticular	 (also	 called	 periarticular)	 pain	 may	 be	 challenging	
to	 the	 unskilled	 examiner.	 Articular	 disorders	 may	 be	 characterized	
by	deep	or	diffuse	pain,	limited	range	of	motion	on	active	and	passive	
movement,	and	swelling	(caused	by	synovial	proliferation,	effusion,	or	
bony	enlargement),	crepitation,	instability,	“locking,”	or	deformity.	By	
contrast,	nonarticular	disorders	tend	to	be	painful	on	active,	but	not	
passive	 (or	 assisted),	 range	 of	 motion.	 Periarticular	 conditions	 often	
demonstrate	point	or	focal	tenderness	in	regions	adjacent	to	articular	
structures,	 may	 radiate	 or	 be	 elicited	 with	 a	 specific	 movement	 or	
position,	 and	 have	 physical	 findings	 remote	 from	 the	 joint	 capsule.	
Moreover,	nonarticular	disorders	seldom	demonstrate	swelling,	crep-
itus,	instability,	or	deformity.

INFLAMMATORY VERSUS 
NONINFLAMMATORY DISORDERS
In	 the	 course	 of	 a	 musculoskeletal	 evaluation,	 the	 examiner	 should	
determine	the	nature	of	the	underlying	pathologic	process	and	whether	
inflammatory	 or	 noninflammatory	 findings	 exist.	 Inflammatory	 dis-
orders	 may	 be	 infectious	 (Neisseria  gonorrhoeae	 or	 Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis),	 crystal-induced	 (gout,	 pseudogout),	 immune-related	
(rheumatoid	 arthritis	 [RA],	 systemic	 lupus	 erythematosus	 [SLE]),	
reactive	 (rheumatic	 fever,	 reactive	 arthritis),	 or	 idiopathic.	 Inflam-
matory	disorders	may	be	suggested	by	any	of	the	four	cardinal	signs	
of	 inflammation	 (erythema,	 warmth,	 pain,	 or	 swelling),	 systemic	
symptoms	 (fatigue,	 fever,	 rash,	 weight	 loss),	 or	 laboratory	 evidence	
of	 inflammation	 (elevated	 erythrocyte	 sedimentation	 rate	 [ESR]	 or	
C-reactive	protein	[CRP],	thrombocytosis,	anemia	of	chronic	disease,	
or	 hypoalbuminemia).	 Articular	 stiffness	 commonly	 accompanies	
chronic	 musculoskeletal	 disorders.	 The	 duration	 of	 stiffness	 may	
be	 prolonged	 (hours)	 with	 inflammatory	 disorders	 (such	 as	 RA	 or	
polymyalgia	 rheumatica	 [PMR])	 and	 improves	 with	 activity.	 By	 con-
trast,	intermittent	stiffness	(also	known	as	gel	phenomenon),	typical	of	
noninflammatory	conditions	(such	as	osteoarthritis	[OA]),	is	shorter	
in	duration	(<60	min)	and	is	exacerbated	by	activity.	Fatigue	may	be

profound	with	inflammation	(as	seen	in	RA	and	PMR)	but	may	also	be	
a	consequence	of	fibromyalgia	(a	noninflammatory	disorder),	chronic	
pain,	poor	sleep,	depression,	anemia,	cardiac	failure,	endocrinopathy,	
or	malnutrition.

Noninflammatory	disorders	may	be	related	to	trauma	(rotator	cuff	
tear),	 repetitive	 use	 (bursitis,	 tendinitis),	 degeneration	 or	 ineffective	
repair	 (OA),	 neoplasm	 (pigmented	 villonodular	 synovitis),	 or	 pain	
amplification	 (fibromyalgia).	 Noninflammatory	 disorders	 are	 often	
characterized	by	pain	without	synovial	swelling	or	warmth,	absence	of	
inflammatory	or	systemic	features,	intermittent	gel	phenomena	rather	
than	 prolonged	 morning	 stiffness,	 and	 normal	 (for	 age)	 or	 negative	
laboratory	investigations.

With	identification	of	the	nature	of	the	underlying	process	and	the	site	
of	the	complaint,	the	examiner	can	further	categorize	the	musculoskel-
etal	 presentation	 (e.g.,	 acute	 inflammatory	 monoarthritis,	 chronic	
noninflammatory,	 nonarticular	 widespread	 pain).	 By	 narrowing	 the	
diagnostic	considerations,	the	examiner	can	assess	the	need	for	imme-
diate	diagnostic	or	therapeutic	intervention	or	for	continued	observa-
tion.	Figure 370-1	presents	an	algorithmic	approach	to	the	evaluation	
of	 patients	 with	 musculoskeletal	 complaints.	 This	 approach	 relies	 on	
clinical	and	historic	features,	rather	than	laboratory	testing,	to	diagnose	
many	common	rheumatic	disorders.

A	simpler,	alternative	approach	would	consider	the	most	commonly	
encountered	 complaints	 first,	 based	 on	 frequency	 in	 younger	 versus

older	 populations.	 The	 most	 prevalent	 causes	 of	 musculoskeletal	
complaints	are	shown	in	Fig. 370-2.	Because	trauma,	fracture,	overuse	
syndromes,	 and	 fibromyalgia	 are	 among	 the	 most	 common	 causes	
of	 musculoskeletal	 pain,	 these	 should	 be	 considered	 with	 each	 new	
encounter.	If	excluded,	other	frequently	occurring	disorders	should	be	
considered	according	to	the	patient’s	age.	Hence,	those	aged	<60	years	
are	 commonly	 affected	 by	 repetitive	 use/strain	 disorders,	 gout	 (men	
only),	 RA,	 spondyloarthritis,	 and	 uncommonly,	 infectious	 arthritis.	
Patients	aged	>60	years	are	frequently	affected	by	OA,	crystal	(gout	and	
pseudogout)	arthritis,	PMR,	osteoporotic	fracture,	and	uncommonly,	
septic	arthritis.	These	conditions	are	between	10	and	100	times	more	
prevalent	 than	 other	 serious	 autoimmune	 conditions,	 such	 as	 SLE,	
scleroderma,	polymyositis,	and	vasculitis.
 ■ CLINICAL HISTORY
Historic	features	may	reveal	important	clues	to	the	diagnosis.	Aspects	
of	 the	 patient	 profile,	 complaint	 chronology,	 extent	 of	 joint	 involve-
ment,	 and	 precipitating	 factors	 can	 provide	 important	 information.	
Certain	diagnoses	are	more	frequent	in	different	age	groups.	SLE	and	
reactive	arthritis	occur	more	frequently	in	the	young,	whereas	fibromy-
algia	and	RA	are	frequent	in	middle	age,	and	OA	and	PMR	are	more	
prevalent	among	the	elderly.	Diagnostic	clustering	is	also	evident	when	
sex	 and	 race	 are	 considered.	 Gout,	 spondyloarthritis,	 and	 ankylosing	
spondylitis	are	more	common	in	men,	whereas	RA,	fibromyalgia,	oste-
oporosis,	and	lupus	are	more	frequent	in	women.	Racial predilections	
may	 be	 evident.	 Thus,	 PMR,	 giant	 cell	 arteritis,	 and	 granulomatosis	
with	 polyangiitis	 (GPA;	 formerly	 called	 Wegener’s	 granulomatosis)	
commonly	affect	whites,	whereas	sarcoidosis	and	SLE	more	commonly	
affect	 African	 Americans.	 Familial  aggregation	 is	 unlikely	 for	 most	
arthropathies	but	may	be	seen	with	ankylosing	spondylitis,	gout,	and	
Heberden’s	nodes	of	OA.

The	chronology	of	the	complaint	is	an	important	diagnostic	feature	
and	can	be	divided	into	the	onset, evolution,	and	duration.	The	onset	
of	disorders	such	as	septic	arthritis	or	gout	tends	to	be	abrupt,	whereas	
OA,	RA,	and	fibromyalgia	may	have	more	indolent	presentations.	The	
patients’	complaints	may	evolve	differently	and	be	classified	as	chronic	
(OA),	 intermittent	 (crystal	 or	 Lyme	 arthritis),	 migratory	 (rheumatic	

fever,	gonococcal	or	viral	arthritis),	or	additive	(RA,	psoriatic	arthritis).	
Musculoskeletal	 disorders	 are	 typically	 classified	 as	 acute	 or	 chronic	
based	 on	 a	 symptom	 duration	 that	 is	 either	 <6	 weeks	 or	 >6	 weeks,	
respectively.	Acute	arthropathies	tend	to	be	infectious,	crystal-induced,	
or	 reactive.	 Chronic	 conditions	 include	 noninflammatory	 or	 immu-
nologic	 arthritides	 (e.g.,	 OA,	 RA)	 and	 nonarticular	 disorders	 (e.g.,	
fibromyalgia).

The	extent	or	distribution	of	articular	involvement	is	often	informa-
tive.	 Articular	 disorders	 are	 classified	 based	 on	 the	 number	 of	 joints	
involved,	 as	 either	 monarticular	 (one	 joint),	 oligoarticular	 or	 paucia-
rticular	 (two	 or	 three	 joints),	 or	 polyarticular	 (four	 or	 more	 joints).	
Although	crystal	and	infectious	arthritis	are	often	mono-	or	oligoartic-
ular,	OA	and	RA	are	usually	polyarticular.	Nonarticular	disorders	may	
be	 classified	 as	 either	 focal	 or	 widespread.	 Complaints	 secondary	 to	
tendinitis	or	carpal	tunnel	syndrome	are	typically	focal,	whereas	weak-
ness	 and	 myalgia,	 caused	 by	 polymyositis	 or	 fibromyalgia,	 are	 more	
widespread	in	their	presentation.	Joint	involvement	in	RA	tends	to	be	
symmetric	 and	 polyarticular.	 By	 contrast,	 spondyloarthritis,	 reactive	
arthritis,	 gout,	 and	 sarcoid	 are	 often	 asymmetric	 and	 oligoarticular.	
OA	and	psoriatic	arthritis	may	be	either	symmetric	or	asymmetric	and	
oligo-	or	polyarticular.	The	upper	extremities	are	frequently	involved	
in	 RA	 and	 OA,	 whereas	 lower	 extremity	 arthritis	 is	 characteristic	 of	
reactive	arthritis	and	gout	at	their	onset.	Involvement	of	the	axial	skel-
eton	is	common	in	OA	and	ankylosing	spondylitis	but	is	infrequent	in	
RA,	with	the	notable	exception	of	the	cervical	spine.

The	 clinical	 history	 should	 also	 identify	 precipitating  events,	
such	 as	 trauma	 (osteonecrosis,	 meniscal	 tear),	 drug	 administration	
(Table 370-2),	antecedent	or	intercurrent	infection	(reactive	arthritis,	
hepatitis,	chikungunya),	or	illnesses	that	may	have	contributed	to	the	
patient’s	 complaint.	 Certain	 comorbidities	 may	 have	 musculoskeletal	
consequences.	 This	 is	 especially	 so	 for	 diabetes	 mellitus	 (carpal	 tun-
nel	 syndrome),	 renal	 insufficiency	 (gout),	 depression	 or	 insomnia	
(fibromyalgia),	 myeloma	 (spinal	 pain),	 cancer	 (myositis),	 and	 osteo-
porosis	(fracture)	or	when	using	certain	drugs	such	as	glucocorticoids	
(osteonecrosis,	 septic	 arthritis),	 diuretics,	 or	 chemotherapy	 (gout)	
(Table	370-2).

Lastly,	a	thorough	rheumatic review of systems	may	disclose	useful	
diagnostic	information.	A	variety	of	musculoskeletal	disorders	may	be	
associated	 with	 systemic	 features	 such	 as	 fever	 (Still’s	 disease,	 infec-
tion),	 rash	 (SLE,	 psoriatic	 arthritis),	 nail	 abnormalities	 (psoriatic	 or	
reactive	 arthritis),	 myalgias	 (fibromyalgia,	 statin-	 or	 drug-induced	
myopathy),	or	weakness	(polymyositis,	neuropathy).	In	addition,	some	
conditions	 are	 associated	 with	 involvement	 of	 other	 organ	 systems	
including	 the	 eyes	 (Behçet’s	 disease,	 sarcoidosis,	 spondyloarthritis),	
gastrointestinal	tract	(scleroderma,	inflammatory	bowel	disease),	gen-
itourinary	tract	(reactive	arthritis,	gonococcemia),	or	nervous	system	
(Lyme	disease,	vasculitis).

 ■ FIBROMYALGIA
Syphilis	 and	 tuberculosis	 have	 been	 called	 the	 “great	 masqueraders”	
as	their	protean	symptoms	and	potential	for	multiorgan	involvement	
may	 result	 in	 delays	 in	 diagnosis	 and	 treatment.	 In	 the	 modern	 era,	
other	 serious	 diagnoses	 (including	 lupus,	 sarcoidosis,	 vasculitis,	 and	
lymphoma)	have	also	been	labeled	as	great	masqueraders.	All	of	these	
are	 either	 uncommon	 or	 rare,	 compared	 to	 the	 more	 common	 mas-
querader	 of	 musculoskeletal	 complaints—fibromyalgia.	 Fibromyalgia	
(see Chap. 373)	is	a	pain	amplification	disorder	unified	by	sleep	distur-
bance,	exaggerated	pain	and	sensitivity	(owing	to	lowered	pain	thresh-
olds),	and	a	multiplicity	of	symptoms	with	a	paucity	of	abnormalities	
on	clinical	examination	or	laboratory	testing.	Tender	“trigger	points”	
may	be	elicited	over	the	epicondyles,	trochanteric	bursae,	anserine	bur-
sae,	and	specific	muscles	(gluteal,	trapezius,	supraspinatus).	Fibromy-
algia	 is	 characterized	 by	 widespread	 aches	 and	 pains,	 even	 though	
presenting	symptoms	tend	to	be	fewer	or	focal.	Fibromyalgia	coexists	
with	numerous	comorbidities	including	irritable	bowel	syndrome,	dys-
menorrhea,	migraine,	depression,	anxiety,	memory	loss,	nonanatomic	
paresthesia	or	dysesthesia,	fatigue,	myalgias,	temporomandibular	joint	
pain,	hypermobility,	and	multiple	chemical	sensitivities.	Fibromyalgia

Although	 nearly	 all	 rheumatic	 disorders	 afflict	 the	 elderly,	 geriatric	
patients	are	particularly	prone	to	OA,	osteoporosis,	osteoporotic	frac-
tures,	gout,	pseudogout,	PMR,	vasculitis,	and	drug-induced	disorders	
(Table	370-2).	The	elderly	should	be	approached	in	the	same	manner	
as	other	patients	with	musculoskeletal	complaints,	but	with	an	empha-
sis	 on	 identifying	 the	 potential	 rheumatic	 consequences	 of	 medical	
comorbidities	 and	 therapies	 used	 in	 the	 elderly.	 The	 physical	 exami-
nation	should	identify	the	nature	of	the	musculoskeletal	complaint	as	
well	as	coexisting	diseases	that	may	influence	diagnosis	and	choice	of	
treatment.

RHEUMATOLOGIC EVALUATION OF  
THE HOSPITALIZED PATIENT
Evaluation	of	a	hospitalized	patient	with	rheumatic	complaints	is	often	
more	 complex	 owing	 to	 symptom	 severity,	 acute	 presentations,	 and	
greater	 interplay	 of	 comorbidities.	 Patients	 with	 rheumatic	 disorders	
tend	 to	 be	 admitted	 for	 one	 of	 several	 reasons:	 (1)	 acute	 onset	 of	
inflammatory	 arthritis	 (possibly	 gout	 or	 septic	 arthritis);	 (2)	 undi-
agnosed	 systemic	 or	 febrile	 illness;	 (3)	 musculoskeletal	 trauma;	 (4)	
exacerbation	or	deterioration	of	an	existing	musculoskeletal	disorder	
(e.g.,	SLE);	or	(5)	new	medical	comorbidities	(e.g.,	thrombotic	event,	
lymphoma,	infection)	arising	in	patients	with	an	established	rheumatic	
disorder.	 Notably,	 rheumatic	 patients	 are	 seldom	 if	 ever	 admitted	
because	of	widespread	pain	or	serologic	abnormalities	or	for	the	initi-
ation	of	new	therapies.

Acute	 monoarticular	 inflammatory	 arthritis	 is	 a	 “red	 flag”	 pre-
sentation	 (e.g.,	 septic	 arthritis,	 gout,	 pseudogout)	 that	 may	 require	
arthrocentesis	 or	 hospitalization	 if	 infection	 is	 suspected.	 New-onset	
inflammatory	 polyarthritis	 has	 a	 wide	 differential	 diagnosis	 (e.g.,	
RA,	hepatitis-related	arthritis,	chikungunya	arthritis,	serum	sickness,	
drug-induced	 lupus,	 SLE,	 polyarticular	 septic	 arthritis)	 and	 may	
require	targeted	laboratory	investigations	more	so	than	synovial	fluid	
analyses.	 Patients	 with	 febrile,	 multisystem	 disorders	 require	 exclu-
sion	 of	 crystal,	 infectious,	 or	 neoplastic	 etiologies	 and	 an	 evaluation	
driven	by	the	dominant	symptom/finding	with	the	greatest	specificity.	
Conditions	worthy	of	consideration	may	include	gout	or	pseudogout,	
vasculitis	 (giant	 cell	 arteritis	 in	 the	 elderly	 or	 polyarteritis	 nodosa	 in	
younger	 patients),	 adult-onset	 Still’s	 disease,	 SLE,	 antiphospholipid	
antibody	syndrome,	IgG4-related	disease,	and	sarcoidosis.	A	preexist-
ing	rheumatic	diagnosis	(e.g.,	SLE,	RA,	ankylosing	spondylitis)	should	
be	confirmed	by	careful	history	and	examination	and	review	of	med-
ical	 records,	 as	 this	 will	 influence	 the	 ensuing	 in-patient	 evaluation.	
Notably,	when	established	rheumatic	disease	patients	are	admitted	to	
the	hospital,	it	is	usually	not	for	their	autoimmune	disease,	but	rather	
a	comorbid	medical	problem	or	complication	of	drug	therapy.	Patients	
with	chronic	inflammatory	disorders	(e.g.,	RA,	SLE,	psoriasis)	have	an	
augmented	risk	of	infection,	cardiovascular	events,	pulmonary	disor-
ders,	and	neoplasia.

Certain	conditions,	such	as	acute	gout,	can	be	precipitated	in	hospi-
talized	patients	by	surgery,	dehydration,	or	medications	and	should	be	
considered	when	hospitalized	patients	are	evaluated	for	the	acute	onset	
of	a	musculoskeletal	condition.	Lastly,	overly	aggressive	and	unfocused	
laboratory	 testing	 will	 often	 yield	 abnormal	 findings	 that	 are	 better	
explained	by	the	patient’s	preexisting	condition	(chronic	lung,	renal,	or	
liver	disease)	rather	than	a	new	inflammatory	or	autoimmune	disorder	
(lupus,	vasculitis).

RHEUMATOLOGIC EVALUATION  
OF THE ELDERLY
The	incidence	of	rheumatic	diseases	rises	with	age,	such	that	58%	of	
those	>65	years	will	have	joint	complaints.	Musculoskeletal	disorders	
in	elderly	patients	are	often	not	diagnosed	because	the	signs	and	symp-
toms	may	be	insidious,	overlooked,	or	overshadowed	by	comorbidities.	
These	 difficulties	 are	 compounded	 by	 the	 diminished	 reliability	 of	
laboratory	 testing	 in	 the	 elderly,	 who	 often	 manifest	 nonpathologic	
abnormal	results.	For	example,	the	ESR	may	be	misleadingly	elevated,	
and	 low-titer	 positive	 tests	 for	 rheumatoid	 factor	 (RF)	 and	 antinu-
clear	antibodies	(ANAs)	may	be	seen	in	up	to	15%	of	elderly	patients.	

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The	 goal	 of	 the	 physical	 examination	 is	 to	 ascertain	 the	 structures	
involved,	the	nature	of	the	underlying	pathology,	the	functional	conse-
quences	of	the	process,	and	the	presence	of	systemic	or	extraarticular	
manifestations.	 A	 knowledge	 of	 topographic	 anatomy	 is	 necessary	
to	 identify	 the	 primary	 site(s)	 of	 involvement	 and	 differentiate	 artic-
ular	 from	 nonarticular	 disorders.	 The	 musculoskeletal	 examination	
depends	largely	on	careful	inspection,	palpation,	contralateral	compar-
ison,	and	a	variety	of	specific	physical	maneuvers	to	elicit	diagnostic	
signs	(Table 370-3).	Although	most	articulations	of	the	appendicular	
skeleton	 can	 be	 examined	 in	 this	 manner,	 adequate	 inspection	 and

Crepitus

 A palpable (less commonly audible) vibratory or crackling sensation elicited 
with joint motion; fine joint crepitus is common and often insignificant in 
large joints; coarse joint crepitus indicates advanced cartilaginous and 
degenerative changes (as in osteoarthritis)

Subluxation

 Alteration of joint alignment such that articulating surfaces incompletely 
approximate each other

Dislocation

 Abnormal displacement of articulating surfaces such that the surfaces are not 
in contact
Range of motion

 For diarthrodial joints, the arc of measurable movement through which the 
joint moves in a single plane

Contracture

 Loss of full movement resulting from a fixed resistance caused either by 
tonic spasm of muscle (reversible) or by fibrosis of periarticular structures 
(permanent)

Deformity

 Abnormal shape or size resulting from bony hypertrophy, malalignment of 
articulating structures, or damage to periarticular supportive structures

Enthesitis

Inflammation of the entheses (tendinous or ligamentous insertions on bone)

Epicondylitis

Infection or inflammation involving an epicondyle

palpation	 are	 not	 possible	 for	 many	 axial	 (e.g.,	 zygapophyseal)	 and	
inaccessible	 (e.g.,	 sacroiliac	 or	 hip)	 joints.	 For	 such	 joints,	 there	 is	 a	
greater	reliance	on	specific	maneuvers	and	imaging	for	assessment.

Examination	 of	 involved	 and	 uninvolved	 joints	 will	 determine	
whether	pain, warmth, erythema,	or	swelling	is	present.	The	locale	and	
level	of	pain	elicited	by	palpation	or	movement	should	be	quantified.	
Examination	 of	 28	 easily	 palpated	 joints	 (proximal	 interphalangeals	
[PIPs],	metacarpophalangeals	[MCPs],	wrists,	elbows,	shoulders,	and	
knees)	 can	 quantify	 the	 number	 of	 tender	 or	 swollen	 joints	 (0–28)	
involved.	Careful	examination	should	distinguish	between	true	articu-
lar	swelling	(caused	by	bony	hypertrophy,	synovial	effusion	or	prolifer-
ation)	and	nonarticular	(or	periarticular)	involvement,	which	usually	
extends	 beyond	 the	 normal	 joint	 margins.	 Cautious	 palpation	 can	
distinguish	synovial	effusion	(fluctuant	swelling)	from	synovial	hyper-
trophy	 (grape-like	 compressibility)	 and	 bony	 hypertrophy	 (firm	 as	 a	
nut).	Small	to	moderate	knee	effusions	may	be	identified	by	the	“bulge	
sign”	or	“ballottement	of	the	patellae.”	Bursal	effusions	(e.g.,	effusions	
of	the	olecranon	or	prepatellar	bursa)	are	often	focal	and	periarticular,	
overlie	bony	prominences,	and	are	fluctuant	with	defined	borders.	Joint	
stability	can	be	assessed	by	stabilizing	the	proximal	joint	and	applying	
manual	stress	to	the	distal	appendage	in	different	planes.	Subluxation	
or	 dislocation,	 which	 may	 be	 secondary	 to	 traumatic,	 mechanical,	 or	
inflammatory	 causes,	 can	 be	 assessed	 by	 inspection	 and	 palpation.	
Joint	swelling	or	volume	can	be	assessed	by	palpation.	Distention	of	the	
articular	capsule	usually	causes	pain	and	evident	enlargement	or	fluc-
tuance.	The	patient	will	attempt	to	minimize	the	pain	by	maintaining	
the	 joint	 in	 the	 position	 of	 least	 intraarticular	 pressure	 and	 greatest	
volume	 (usually	 partial	 flexion),	 possibly	 leading	 to	 flexion	 contrac-
ture	over	time.	Active	and	passive	range of motion	should	be	assessed	
in	 all	 planes,	 with	 contralateral	 comparison.	 A	 goniometer	 may	 be	
used	to	quantify	the	arc	of	movement.	Each	joint	should	be	passively	
manipulated	through	its	full	range	of	motion	(including,	as	appropri-
ate,	flexion,	extension,	rotation,	abduction,	adduction,	lateral	bending,	
inversion,	 eversion,	 supination,	 pronation,	 medial/lateral	 deviation,	
and	plantar-	or	dorsiflexion).	Extreme	range	of	motion	and	connective	
tissue	laxity	may	be	seen	with	hypermobility	syndrome,	Ehlers-Danlos	
syndrome,	or	Marfan’s	syndrome.	Limitation	of	motion	or	contractures	
are	 frequently	 caused	 by	 inflammation,	 effusion,	 pain,	 deformity,	 or	
neuromyopathic	 causes.	 If	 passive	 motion	 exceeds	 active	 motion,	 a	

periarticular	 process	 (e.g.,	 tendinitis,	 tendon	 rupture,	 or	 myopathy)	
should	 be	 considered.	 Contractures	 may	 reflect	 antecedent	 synovial	
inflammation	 or	 trauma.	 Minor	 joint	 crepitus	 is	 common	 during	
joint	 palpation	 and	 maneuvers	 but	 may	 indicate	 significant	 cartilage	
degeneration	as	it	becomes	coarser	(e.g.,	OA).	Joint	deformity	usually	
indicates	a	long-standing	or	aggressive	pathologic	process.	Deformities	
may	result	from	ligamentous	destruction,	soft	tissue	contracture,	bony	
enlargement,	 ankylosis,	 erosive	 disease,	 subluxation,	 trauma,	 or	 loss	
of	 proprioception.	 Examination	 of	 the	 musculature	 will	 document	
strength,	 atrophy,	 pain,	 or	 spasm.	 Appendicular	 muscle	 weakness	
should	be	characterized	as	proximal	or	distal.	Muscle	strength	should	
be	assessed	by	observing	the	patient’s	performance	(e.g.,	walking,	ris-
ing	from	a	chair,	grasping,	writing).	Strength	may	also	be	graded	on	
a	5-point	scale:	0	for	no	movement;	1	for	trace	movement	or	twitch;		
2	for	movement	with	gravity	eliminated;	3	for	movement	against	gravity	
only;	4	for	movement	against	gravity	and	resistance;	and	5	for	normal	
strength.	The	examiner	should	assess	for	often	overlooked	nonarticular	
or	periarticular	involvement,	especially	when	articular	complaints	are	
not	supported	by	objective	findings	referable	to	the	joint	capsule.	The	
identification	 of	 soft	 tissue	 or	 nonarticular	 pain	 will	 prevent	 unwar-
ranted	and	often	expensive	additional	evaluations.	Specific	maneuvers	
may	reveal	common	nonarticular	abnormalities,	such	as	a	carpal	tun-
nel	syndrome	(which	can	be	identified	by	Tinel’s	sign	of	Durkan’s	test).	
Other	examples	of	soft	tissue	abnormalities	include	olecranon	bursitis,	
epicondylitis	 (e.g.,	 tennis	 elbow),	 enthesitis	 (e.g.,	 Achilles	 tendinitis),	
and	tender	trigger	points	associated	with	fibromyalgia.

APPROACH TO REGIONAL RHEUMATIC 
COMPLAINTS
Although	 all	 patients	 should	 be	 evaluated	 in	 a	 logical	 and	 thorough	
manner,	many	focal	musculoskeletal	complaints	are	commonly	caused	
by	disorders	that	exhibit	a	predictable	pattern	of	onset,	evolution,	and	
localization;	 they	 can	 often	 be	 easily	 diagnosed	 with	 limited	 historic	
information	 and	 selected	 maneuvers	 or	 tests.	 Although	 nearly	 every	
musculoskeletal	 complaint	 could	 be	 approached	 in	 this	 manner,	 the	
evaluation	 of	 four	 commonly	 involved	 anatomic	 regions—the	 hand,	
shoulder,	hip,	and	knee—are	reviewed	here.
 ■ HAND PAIN
Focal	or	unilateral	hand	pain	may	result	from	trauma,	overuse,	infec-
tion,	 or	 a	 reactive	 or	 crystal-induced	 arthritis.	 By	 contrast,	 bilateral	
hand	 complaints	 commonly	 suggest	 a	 degenerative	 (e.g.,	 OA),	 sys-
temic,	or	inflammatory/immune	(e.g.,	RA)	etiology.	The	distribution	
or	pattern	of	joint	involvement	is	highly	suggestive	of	certain	disorders	
(Fig.  370-3).	 Thus,	 OA	 (or	 degenerative	 arthritis)	 may	 manifest	 as	
distal	interphalangeal	(DIP)	and	PIP	joint	pain	and	bony	hypertrophy	
leading	 to	 Heberden’s	 and	 Bouchard’s	 nodes,	 respectively.	 Pain,	 with	
or	without	bony	swelling,	involving	the	base	of	the	thumb	(first	car-
pometacarpal	 joint)	 is	 also	 highly	 suggestive	 of	 OA.	 By	 contrast,	 RA	
manifests	 as	 an	 additive,	 symmetric,	 polyarticular	 arthritis	 involving	
the	PIP,	MCP,	intercarpal,	and	carpometacarpal	joints	(wrist)	with	pain	
and	palpable	synovial	tissue	hypertrophy.	Psoriatic	arthritis	may	mimic	
the	pattern	of	joint	involvement	seen	in	OA	(DIP	and	PIP	joints)	but	
can	be	distinguished	by	the	presence	of	inflammatory	signs	(erythema,	
warmth,	 synovial	 swelling),	 with	 or	 without	 carpal	 involvement,	 nail	
pitting,	or	onycholysis.	Whereas	lateral	or	medial	subluxations	at	the	
PIP	or	DIP	joints	are	most	likely	due	to	inflammatory	OA	or	psoriatic	
arthritis,	 dorsal	 or	 ventral	 deformities	 (swan	 neck	 or	 boutonnière	
deformities)	are	typical	of	RA.	Hemochromatosis	should	be	considered	
when	degenerative	changes	(bony	hypertrophy)	are	seen	at	the	second	
and	third	MCP	joints	with	associated	radiographic	chondrocalcinosis	
or	episodic,	inflammatory	wrist	arthritis.

Dactylitis	 manifests	 as	 soft	 tissue	 swelling	 of	 the	 whole	 digit	 and	
may	 have	 a	 sausage-like	 appearance.	 Common	 causes	 of	 dactylitis	
include	 psoriatic	 arthritis,	 spondyloarthritis,	 juvenile	 spondylitis,	
mixed	 connective	 tissue	 disease,	 scleroderma,	 sarcoidosis,	 and	 sickle	
cell	disease.	Soft	tissue	swelling	over	the	dorsum	of	the	hand	and	wrist	
may	suggest	an	inflammatory	extensor	tendon	tenosynovitis	possibly	
caused	by	gonococcal	infection,	gout,	or	inflammatory	arthritis	(e.g.,

RA).	 Tenosynovitis	 is	 suggested	 by	 localized	 warmth,	 swelling,	 or	
pitting	 edema	 and	 may	 be	 confirmed	 when	 the	 soft	 tissue	 swelling	
tracks	with	tendon	movement	during	flexion	and	extension	of	fingers,	
or	when	pain	is	induced	while	stretching	the	extensor	tendon	sheaths	
(flexing	the	digits	distal	to	the	MCP	joints	and	maintaining	the	wrist	
in	 a	 fixed,	 neutral	 position).	 Volar	 (palmar)	 tendon	 swellings	 may	
be	 from	 tenosynovitis,	 Dupuytren’s	 contractures,	 tendon	 nodules,	 or	
synovial	cysts.

Focal	wrist	pain	localized	to	the	radial	aspect	may	be	caused	by	de	
Quervain’s	 tenosynovitis	 resulting	 from	 inflammation	 of	 the	 tendon	
sheath(s)	 involving	 the	 abductor	 pollicis	 longus	 or	 extensor	 pollicis	
brevis	 (Fig.	 370-3).	 This	 commonly	 results	 from	 overuse	 or	 follows	
pregnancy	 and	 may	 be	 diagnosed	 with	 Finkelstein’s	 test.	 A	 positive	
result	 is	 present	 when	 radial	 wrist	 pain	 is	 induced	 after	 the	 thumb	
is	 flexed	 and	 placed	 inside	 a	 clenched	 fist	 and	 the	 patient	 actively	
deviates	the	hand	downward	with	ulnar	deviation	at	the	wrist.	Carpal	
tunnel	syndrome	is	another	common	disorder	of	the	upper	extremity	
and	results	from	compression	of	the	median	nerve	within	the	carpal	
tunnel.	Manifestations	include	pain	in	the	wrist	that	may	radiate	with	
paresthesia	to	the	thumb,	second	and	third	fingers,	and	radial	half	of	
the	fourth	finger	and,	at	times,	atrophy	of	thenar	musculature.	Carpal	
tunnel	 syndrome	 is	 commonly	 associated	 with	 pregnancy,	 edema,	
trauma,	 OA,	 inflammatory	 arthritis,	 and	 infiltrative	 disorders	 (e.g.,	
amyloidosis).	The	diagnosis	may	be	suggested	by	a	positive	Durkan’s	
test	 or	 Tinel’s	 sign.	 With	 each	 test,	 paresthesia	 in	 a	 median	 nerve	
distribution	 is	 induced	 or	 increased	 by	 30	 s	 of	 compression	 over	 the	
carpal	 tunnel	 (Durkan’s	 test)	 or	 “thumping”	 the	 volar	 aspect	 of	 the	
wrist	 (Tinel’s	 sign).	 The	 low	 sensitivity	 and	 moderate	 specificity	 of	
these	tests	may	require	nerve	conduction	velocity	testing	to	confirm	a	
suspected	diagnosis.
 ■ SHOULDER PAIN
During	the	evaluation	of	shoulder	disorders,	the	examiner	should	care-
fully	note	any	history	of	trauma,	fibromyalgia,	infection,	inflammatory	

disease,	occupational	hazards,	or	previous	cervical	disease.	In	addition,	
the	 patient	 should	 be	 questioned	 as	 to	 the	 activities	 or	 movement(s)	
that	elicit	shoulder	pain.	While	arthritis	is	suggested	by	pain	on	move-
ment	 in	 all	 planes,	 pain	 with	 specific	 active	 motion	 suggests	 a	 peri-
articular	 (nonarticular)	 process.	 Shoulder	 pain	 may	 originate	 in	 the	
glenohumeral	 or	 acromioclavicular	 joints,	 subacromial	 (subdeltoid)	
bursa,	 periarticular	 soft	 tissues	 (e.g.,	 fibromyalgia,	 rotator	 cuff	 tear/
tendinitis),	 or	 cervical	 spine	 (Fig.  370-4).	 Shoulder	 pain	 is	 referred	
frequently	from	the	cervical	spine	but	may	also	be	referred	from	intra-
thoracic	lesions	(e.g.,	a	Pancoast	tumor)	or	from	gallbladder,	hepatic,	
or	diaphragmatic	disease.	These	same	visceral	causes	may	also	manifest	
as	focal	scapular	pain.	Fibromyalgia	should	be	suspected	when	gleno-
humeral	pain	is	accompanied	by	diffuse	periarticular	(i.e.,	subacromial,	
bicipital)	 pain,	 tender	 points	 (i.e.,	 trapezius	 or	 supraspinatus),	 and	 a	
sleep	disturbance.	The	shoulder	should	be	put	through	its	full	range	of	
motion	both	actively	and	passively	(with	examiner	assistance):	forward	
flexion,	 extension,	 abduction,	 adduction,	 and	 internal	 and	 external	
rotation.	 Manual	 inspection	 of	 the	 periarticular	 structures	 will	 often	
provide	important	diagnostic	information.	Glenohumeral	involvement	
is	best	detected	by	placing	the	thumb	over	the	glenohumeral	joint	just	
medial	 and	 inferior	 to	 the	 coracoid	 process	 and	 applying	 pressure	
anteriorly	 while	 internally	 and	 externally	 rotating	 the	 humeral	 head.	
Pain	localized	to	this	region	is	indicative	of	glenohumeral	pathology.	
Synovial	 effusion	 or	 tissue	 is	 seldom	 palpable	 but,	 if	 present,	 may	
suggest	infection,	RA,	amyloidosis,	or	an	acute	tear	of	the	rotator	cuff.	
The	examiner	should	apply	direct	manual	pressure	over	the	subacro-
mial	bursa	that	lies	lateral	to	and	immediately	beneath	the	acromion	
(Fig.	370-4).	Subacromial	bursitis	is	a	frequent	cause	of	shoulder	pain.	
Anterior	 to	 the	 subacromial	 bursa,	 the	 bicipital	 tendon	 traverses	 the	
bicipital	 groove.	 This	 tendon	 is	 best	 identified	 by	 palpating	 it	 in	 its	
groove	 as	 the	 patient	 rotates	 the	 humerus	 internally	 and	 externally.	
Direct	pressure	over	the	tendon	may	reveal	pain	indicative	of	bicipital	
tendinitis.	Palpation	of	the	acromioclavicular	joint	may	disclose	local

2850 pain,	bony	hypertrophy,	or,	uncommonly,	synovial	swelling.	Whereas	
OA	and	RA	commonly	affect	the	acromioclavicular	joint,	OA	seldom	
involves	the	glenohumeral	joint,	unless	there	is	avascular	necrosis	or	a	
traumatic	or	occupational	cause.

Rotator	cuff	tendinitis	or	tear	is	a	very	common	cause	of	shoulder	
pain.	Nearly	30%	of	the	elderly	will	have	shoulder	pain,	with	rotator	
cuff	tendinitis	or	tear	as	a	primary	cause.	The	rotator	cuff	is	formed	
by	 four	 tendons	 that	 attach	 the	 scapula	 to	 the	 proximal	 humerus	
(supraspinatus,	 infraspinatus,	 teres	 minor,	 and	 subscapularis	 ten-
dons).	 Of	 these,	 the	 supraspinatus	 muscle	 is	 the	 most	 commonly	
damaged.	 Rotator	 cuff	 tendinitis	 is	 suggested	 by	 pain	 on	 active	
abduction	 (but	 not	 passive	 abduction),	 pain	 over	 the	 lateral	 deltoid	
muscle,	night	pain,	and	evidence	of	the	impingement	signs	(pain	with	
overhead	arm	activities).	The	Neer	test	for	impingement	is	performed	
by	 the	 examiner	 raising	 the	 patient’s	 arm	 into	 forced	 flexion	 while	
stabilizing	and	preventing	rotation	of	the	scapula.	A	positive	sign	is	
present	 if	 pain	 develops	 before	 180°	 of	 forward	 flexion.	 Tear	 of	 the	
rotator	cuff	is	common	in	the	elderly	and	often	results	from	trauma;	
it	may	manifest	in	the	same	manner	as	tendinitis.	The	drop	arm	test	
is	 abnormal	 with	 supraspinatus	 pathology	 and	 is	 demonstrated	 by	
passive	abduction	of	the	arm	to	90°	by	the	examiner.	If	the	patient	is	
unable	to	hold	the	arm	up	actively	or	unable	to	lower	the	arm	slowly	
without	dropping,	the	test	is	positive.	Tendinitis	or	tear	of	the	rota-
tor	cuff	is	best	confirmed	by	magnetic	resonance	imaging	(MRI)	or	
ultrasound.

 ■ KNEE PAIN
Knee	 pain	 may	 result	 from	 intraarticular	 (OA,	 RA)	 or	 periarticular	
(anserine	 bursitis,	 collateral	 ligament	 strain)	 processes	 or	 be	 referred	
from	hip	pathology.	A	careful	history	should	delineate	the	chronology	
of	the	knee	complaint	and	whether	there	are	predisposing	conditions,	
trauma,	or	medications	that	might	underlie	the	complaint.	For	exam-
ple,	 patellofemoral	 disease	 (e.g.,	 OA)	 may	 cause	 anterior	 knee	 pain	
that	worsens	with	climbing	stairs.	Observation	of	the	patient’s	gait	is	
also	important.	The	knee	should	be	carefully	inspected	in	the	upright	
(weight-bearing)	 and	 supine	 positions	 for	 swelling,	 erythema,	 mala-
lignment,	visible	trauma,	muscle	wasting,	and	leg	length	discrepancy.	
The	most	common	malalignment	in	the	knee	is	genu varum	(bowlegs)	
or	 genu  valgum	 (knock-knees)	 resulting	 from	 asymmetric	 cartilage	
loss	medially	or	laterally,	respectively.	Bony	swelling	of	the	knee	joint	
commonly	 results	 from	 hypertrophic	 osseous	 changes	 seen	 with	 dis-
orders	 such	 as	 OA	 and	 neuropathic	 arthropathy.	 Swelling	 caused	 by	
hypertrophy	 of	 the	 synovium	 or	 synovial	 effusion	 may	 manifest	 as	 a	
fluctuant,	 ballotable,	 or	 soft	 tissue	 enlargement	 in	 the	 suprapatellar	
pouch	 (suprapatellar	 reflection	 of	 the	 synovial	 cavity)	 or	 regions	 lat-
eral	and	medial	to	the	patella.	Synovial	effusions	may	also	be	detected	
by	 balloting	 the	 patella	 downward	 toward	 the	 femoral	 groove	 or	 by	
eliciting	a	“bulge	sign.”	With	the	knee	extended,	the	examiner	should	
manually	 compress,	 or	 “milk,”	 synovial	 fluid	 down	 from	 the	 supra-
patellar	 pouch	 and	 lateral	 to	 the	 patellae.	 The	 application	 of	 manual	
pressure	lateral	to	the	patella	may	cause	an	observable	shift	in	synovial	
fluid	(bulge)	to	the	medial	aspect.	The	examiner	should	note	that	this	
maneuver	 is	 only	 effective	 in	 detecting	 small	 to	 moderate	 effusions	
(<100	mL).	Inflammatory	disorders	such	as	RA,	gout,	pseudogout,	and	
psoriatic	arthritis	may	involve	the	knee	joint	and	produce	significant	
pain,	stiffness,	swelling,	or	warmth.	A	popliteal	or	Baker’s cyst	may	be	
palpated	with	the	knee	partially	flexed	and	is	best	viewed	posteriorly	
with	the	patient	standing	and	knees	fully	extended	to	visualize	isolated	
or	unilateral	popliteal	swelling	or	fullness.

Anserine	 bursitis	 is	 an	 often-missed	 periarticular	 cause	 of	 knee	
pain	 in	 adults.	 The	 pes	 anserine	 bursa	 underlies	 the	 insertion	 of	 the	
conjoined	tendons	(sartorius,	gracilis,	semitendinosus)	on	the	antero-
medial	proximal	tibia	and	may	be	painful	following	trauma,	overuse,	or	
inflammation	(bursitis).	It	is	often	tender	in	patients	with	fibromyalgia,	
obesity,	and	knee	OA.	Other	forms	of	bursitis	may	also	present	as	knee	
pain.	The	prepatellar	bursa	is	superficial	and	is	located	over	the	inferior	
portion	of	the	patella.	The	infrapatellar	bursa	is	deeper	and	lies	beneath	
the	patellar	ligament	before	its	insertion	on	the	tibial	tubercle.

Internal	derangement	of	the	knee	may	result	from	trauma	or	degen-
erative	processes.	Damage	to	the	meniscal	cartilage	(medial	or	lateral)	
frequently	presents	as	chronic	or	intermittent	knee	pain.	Such	an	injury	
should	be	suspected	when	there	is	a	history	of	trauma,	athletic	activity,	
or	 chronic	 knee	 arthritis,	 and	 when	 the	 patient	 relates	 symptoms	 of	
“locking”	or	“giving	way”	of	the	knee.	With	the	knee	flexed	90°	and	the	
patient’s	foot	on	the	table,	pain	elicited	during	palpation	over	the	joint	
line	 or	 when	 the	 knee	 is	 stressed	 laterally	 or	 medially	 may	 suggest	 a	
meniscal	tear.	A	positive	McMurray	test	may	also	indicate	a	meniscal	
tear.	To	perform	this	test,	the	knee	is	first	flexed	at	90°,	and	the	leg	is	
then	 extended	 while	 the	 lower	 extremity	 is	 simultaneously	 torqued	
medially	or	laterally.	A	painful	click	during	inward	rotation	may	indi-
cate	 a	 lateral	 meniscus	 tear,	 and	 pain	 during	 outward	 rotation	 may	
indicate	a	tear	in	the	medial	meniscus.	Lastly,	damage	to	the	cruciate	
ligaments	should	be	suspected	with	acute	onset	of	pain,	possibly	with	
swelling,	a	history	of	trauma,	or	a	synovial	fluid	aspirate	that	is	grossly	
bloody.	Examination	of	the	cruciate	ligaments	is	best	accomplished	by	
eliciting	a	drawer	sign.	With	the	patient	recumbent,	the	knee	should	be	
partially	flexed	and	the	foot	stabilized	on	the	examining	surface.	The	
examiner	 should	 manually	 attempt	 to	 displace	 the	 tibia	 anteriorly	 or	
posteriorly	with	respect	to	the	femur.	If	anterior	movement	is	detected,	
then	anterior	cruciate	ligament	damage	is	likely.	Conversely,	significant	
posterior	 movement	 may	 indicate	 posterior	 cruciate	 damage.	 Con-
tralateral	comparison	will	assist	the	examiner	in	detecting	significant	
anterior	or	posterior	movement.

 ■ HIP PAIN
The	hip	is	best	evaluated	by	observing	the	patient’s	gait	and	assessing	
range	 of	 motion.	 The	 vast	 majority	 of	 patients	 reporting	 “hip	 pain”	
localize	 their	 pain	 unilaterally	 to	 the	 posterior	 gluteal	 musculature	
(Fig. 370-5)	with	radiation	down	the	posterolateral	aspect	of	the	thigh,	
and	 the	 pain	 may	 be	 associated	 with	 complaints	 of	 low	 back	 pain.	
This	 presentation	 frequently	 results	 from	 degenerative	 arthritis	 of	
the	lumbosacral	spine	or	disks	and	commonly	follows	a	dermatomal	
distribution	with	involvement	of	nerve	roots	between	L4	and	S1.	Sci-
atica	is	caused	by	impingement	of	the	L4,	L5,	or	S1	nerve	(i.e.,	from	a	
herniated	disk)	and	manifests	as	unilateral	neuropathic	pain	extending	
from	the	gluteal	region	down	the	posterolateral	leg	to	the	foot.	Some	
individuals	instead	localize	their	“hip	pain”	laterally	to	the	area	overly-
ing	the	trochanteric	bursa.	Because	of	the	depth	of	this	bursa,	swelling	
and	 warmth	 are	 usually	 absent.	 Diagnosis	 of	 trochanteric	 bursitis	 or	
enthesitis	can	be	confirmed	by	inducing	point	tenderness	over	the	tro-
chanteric	bursa.	Gluteal	and	trochanteric	pain	are	common	findings	in	
fibromyalgia.	Range	of	movement	may	be	limited	by	pain.	Pain	in	the	
hip	joint	is	less	common	and	tends	to	be	located	anteriorly,	over	the	
inguinal	ligament;	it	may	radiate	medially	to	the	groin.	Uncommonly,	
iliopsoas	bursitis	may	mimic	true	hip	joint	pain.	Diagnosis	of	iliopsoas	
bursitis	 may	 be	 suggested	 by	 a	 history	 of	 trauma	 or	 inflammatory	
arthritis.	Pain	associated	with	iliopsoas	bursitis	is	localized	to	the	groin	
or	anterior	thigh	and	tends	to	worsen	with	hyperextension	of	the	hip;	
many	patients	prefer	to	flex	and	externally	rotate	the	hip	to	reduce	the	
pain	from	a	distended	bursa.

TELEHEALTH MUSCULOSKELETAL 
EVALUATION
Telemedicine	 has	 grown	 significantly	 in	 recent	 years	 as	 a	 means	 of	
remote	patient	assessment	and	providing	remote	clinical	care.	Engage-
ment	 of	 patients	 via	 electronic	 telecommunication	 allows	 for	 virtual	
patient	evaluations	with	a	time,	cost,	and	convenience	advantage,	but	
can	 be	 a	 technological	 disadvantage	 for	 the	 elderly	 or	 disadvantaged	
populations.	 Telemedicine	 is	 most	 efficient	 with	 quality	 audio	 and	
video	connections	and	can	be	used	for	patient	education,	monitoring,	
and	 routine	 disease	 assessments.	 Patients	 evaluated	 by	 telemedicine	
should	 undergo	 the	 same	 medical	 history	 and	 inquiry	 as	 a	 routine	
clinic	evaluation,	but	evaluation	will	differ	in	the	scope	of	examination	
and	 maneuvers.	 The	 musculoskeletal	 televideo	 examination	 may	 be	
appropriate	 and	 effective	 in	 many,	 primarily	 by	 supplanting	 physical

palpation	with	observation,	range	of	motion,	patient	self-assessments,	
and	contralateral	comparison.	Specifically,	the	televideo	exam	should	
assess	the	following:	(1)	patient	gait	(to	assess	lower	extremity	abnor-
malities);	 (2)	 rising	 from	 a	 seated	 position	 (to	 assess	 for	 weakness);	
(3)	cervical	range	of	motion	(flexion,	extension,	lateral	bending);	(4)	
assessment	by	contralateral	comparison	(e.g.,	“praying	hands,”	“make	
a	fist,”	“flex	wrists,”	and	“hands	on	ears,	elbows	out”	to	assess	shoulder	
range	of	motion);	and	(5)	side-by-side	inspection	of	knees,	ankles,	and	
feet.	 Effective	 telehealth	 is	 contingent	 on	 clinical	 experience,	 knowl-
edge	of	and	familiarity	with	the	patient,	and	training	the	patient	on	the	
use	of	technology	and	goals	and	limits	of	a	televideo	visit.

LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS
The	vast	majority	of	musculoskeletal	disorders	can	be	logically	diag-
nosed	by	a	complete	history	and	physical	examination.	An	additional	
objective	 of	 the	 initial	 encounter	 is	 to	 determine	 whether	 additional	
investigations	 or	 immediate	 therapy	 is	 required.	 Laboratory	 evalua-
tion	 is	 indicated	 with	 (1)	 monarticular	 conditions;	 (2)	 traumatic	 or	
inflammatory	 conditions;	 (3)	 the	 presence	 of	 neurologic	 findings;		
(4)	systemic	manifestations;	or	(5)	chronic	symptoms	(>6	weeks)	and	
a	lack	of	response	to	symptomatic	measures.	The	extent	and	nature	of	
the	additional	investigation	should	be	dictated	by	the	clinical	features	
and	suspected	pathologic	process.	Laboratory	tests	should	be	used	to	
confirm	a	specific	clinical	diagnosis	and	not	be	used	to	screen	or	eval-
uate	patients	with	vague	rheumatic	complaints.	Indiscriminate	use	of	
broad	batteries	of	diagnostic	tests	and	radiographic	procedures	is	rarely	
a	useful	or	cost-effective	means	to	establish	a	diagnosis.

Besides	a	complete	blood	count,	including	a	white	blood	cell	(WBC)	
and	differential	count,	the	routine	evaluation	should	include	a	determi-
nation	of	an	acute-phase	reactant	such	as	the	ESR	or	CRP,	which	can	
be	useful	in	discriminating	inflammatory	from	noninflammatory	dis-
orders.	Both	are	inexpensive,	easily	obtained,	and	may	be	elevated	with	
infection,	inflammation,	autoimmune	disorders,	neoplasia,	pregnancy,	
renal	insufficiency,	advanced	age,	or	hyperlipidemia.	Extreme	elevation	
of	 the	 acute-phase	 reactants	 (CRP,	 ESR)	 is	 seldom	 seen	 without	 evi-
dence	of	serious	illness	(e.g.,	sepsis,	pleuropericarditis,	PMR,	giant	cell	
arteritis,	adult	Still’s	disease).

Serum	uric	acid	determinations	are	useful	in	the	diagnosis	of	gout	
and	in	monitoring	the	response	to	urate-lowering	therapy.	Uric	acid,	
the	 end	 product	 of	 purine	 metabolism,	 is	 primarily	 excreted	 in	 the	
urine.	 Serum	 values	 range	 from	 238	 to	 516	 μmol/L	 (4.0–8.6	 mg/dL)	
in	 men;	 the	 lower	 values	 (178–351	 μmol/L	 [3.0–5.9	 mg/dL])	 seen	 in	

women	are	caused	by	the	uricosuric	effects	of	estrogen.	Urinary	uric	
acid	 levels	 are	 normally	 <750	 mg	 per	 24	 h.	 Although	 hyperuricemia	
is	 associated	 with	 an	 increased	 incidence	 of	 gout	 and	 nephrolith-
iasis,	 levels	 may	 not	 correlate	 with	 the	 severity	 of	 articular	 disease.	
Uric	 acid	 levels	 (and	 the	 risk	 of	 gout)	 may	 be	 increased	 by	 inborn	
errors	 of	 metabolism	 (Lesch-Nyhan	 syndrome),	 disease	 states	 (renal	
insufficiency,	myeloproliferative	disease,	psoriasis),	or	drugs	(alcohol,	
cytotoxic	 therapy,	 thiazides).	 Although	 nearly	 all	 patients	 with	 gout	
will	demonstrate	hyperuricemia	at	some	time	during	their	illness,	up	
to	50%	of	patients	with	an	acute	gouty	attack	will	have	normal	serum	
uric	acid	levels.	Monitoring	serum	uric	acid	is	useful	in	assessing	the	
response	 to	 urate-lowering	 therapy	 or	 chemotherapy,	 with	 the	 target	
goal	being	a	serum	urate	<6	mg/dL.

Serologic	 tests	 for	 RF,	 cyclic	 anticitrullinated	 peptide	 (CCP	 or	
ACPA)	antibodies,	ANAs,	complement	levels,	Lyme	and	antineutrophil	
cytoplasmic	 antibodies	 (ANCAs),	 or	 antistreptolysin	 O	 (ASO)	 titer	
should	be	carried	out	only	when	there	is	clinical	evidence	to	specifi-
cally	 suggest	 a	 specific	 diagnosis	 because	 these	 have	 poor	 predictive	
value	when	used	for	screening,	especially	when	the	pretest	probability	
is	low.	For	most	of	these,	there	is	no	value	to	repeated	or	serial	serologic	
testing.	Although	4–5%	of	a	healthy	population	will	have	positive	tests	
for	RF	and	ANAs,	only	1%	and	<0.4%	of	the	population	will	have	RA	
or	SLE,	respectively.	IgM	RF	(autoantibodies	against	the	Fc	portion	of	
IgG)	is	found	in	80%	of	patients	with	RA	but	is	poorly	specific	as	it	may	
also	be	seen	in	low	titers	in	patients	with	chronic	infections	(tubercu-
losis,	 leprosy,	 hepatitis);	 other	 autoimmune	 diseases	 (SLE,	 Sjögren’s	
syndrome);	 and	 chronic	 pulmonary,	 hepatic,	 or	 renal	 disease.	 When	
considering	 RA,	 both	 serum	 RF	 and	 anti-CCP	 antibodies	 should	 be	
obtained	as	these	are	complementary.	Both	are	comparably	sensitive,	
but	 CCP	 antibodies	 are	 more	 specific	 than	 RF.	 In	 RA,	 the	 presence	
of	high	titers	of	anti-CCP	or	RF	antibodies,	or	double	positivity,	may	
indicate	 a	 greater	 risk	 for	 more	 severe,	 erosive	 polyarthritis.	 ANAs	
are	 found	 in	 nearly	 all	 patients	 with	 SLE	 and	 may	 also	 be	 seen	 in	
patients	with	other	autoimmune	diseases	(polymyositis,	scleroderma,	
antiphospholipid	syndrome,	Sjögren’s	syndrome),	drug-induced	lupus	
(Table	370-2),	chronic	thyroid,	liver	or	renal	disorders,	and	advanced	
age.	 Positive	 ANAs	 are	 found	 in	 5%	 of	 adults	 and	 in	 up	 to	 14%	 of	
elderly	 or	 chronically	 ill	 individuals.	 The	 ANA	 test	 is	 very	 sensitive	
but	poorly	specific	for	lupus,	as	only	1–2%	of	all	positive	results	will	
be	 caused	 by	 lupus	 alone	 up	 to	 80%	 of	 patients	 with	 thyroid	 disease	
will	be	ANA	positive.	The	interpretation	of	a	positive	ANA	test	may	
depend	 on	 the	 magnitude	 of	 the	 titer	 and	 the	 pattern	 observed	 by

matory	 and	 inflammatory	 processes	 by	 analysis	 of	 the	 appearance,

of	hyaluronate.	Noninflammatory	synovial	fluid	is	clear,	viscous,	and	
amber-colored,	with	a	WBC	count	of	<2000/μL	and	a	predominance	
of	 mononuclear	 cells.	 The	 viscosity	 of	 synovial	 fluid	 is	 assessed	 by	
expressing	fluid	from	the	syringe	one	drop	at	a	time.	Normally,	there	is	
a	stringing	effect,	with	a	long	tail	behind	each	synovial	drop.	Effusions	
caused	by	OA	or	trauma	will	have	normal	viscosity.	Inflammatory	fluid	
is	turbid	and	yellow,	with	an	increased	WBC	count	(2000–50,000/μL)	
and	 a	 polymorphonuclear	 leukocyte	 predominance.	 Inflammatory	
fluid	has	reduced	viscosity	(no	stringing),	diminished	hyaluronate,	and	
little	or	no	tail	following	each	drop	of	synovial	fluid.	Such	effusions	are	
found	in	RA,	gout,	and	other	inflammatory	arthritides.	Septic	fluid	is	
opaque	 and	 purulent,	 with	 a	 WBC	 count	 usually	 >50,000/μL,	 a	 pre-
dominance	of	polymorphonuclear	leukocytes	(>75%),	and	low	viscos-
ity.	Such	effusions	are	typical	of	septic	arthritis	but	may	also	occur	with	
RA	or	gout.	Lastly,	hemorrhagic	synovial	fluid	(hemarthrosis)	may	be	
seen	with	trauma	(ligament	or	cartilage	tears),	osteochondral	fracture,	
neuropathic	arthritis,	or	coagulopathy.	An	algorithm	for	synovial	fluid	
aspiration	and	analysis	is	shown	in	Fig. 370-6.	Synovial	fluid	should	
be	 analyzed	 immediately	 for	 appearance,	 viscosity,	 and	 cell	 count.	
Monosodium	 urate	 crystals	 (observed	 in	 gout)	 are	 seen	 by	 polarized	
microscopy	and	are	long,	needle-shaped,	negatively	birefringent,	and	
usually	 intracellular.	 In	 chondrocalcinosis	 and	 pseudogout,	 calcium	
pyrophosphate	dihydrate	crystals	are	usually	short,	rhomboid-shaped,	
and	positively	birefringent.	Whenever	infection	is	suspected,	synovial	
fluid	should	be	Gram	stained	and	cultured	appropriately.	If	gonococcal	
arthritis	 is	 suspected,	 nucleic	 acid	 amplification	 tests	 should	 be	 used	

Strongly consider synovial fluid aspiration
and analysis if there is
• Monarthritis (acute or chronic)
• Trauma with joint effusion
• Monarthritis in a patient with chronic polyarthritis
• Suspicion of joint infection, crystal-induced arthritis, or hemarthrosis

Analyze fluid for
• Appearance, viscosity
• WBC count, differential

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING IN JOINT DISEASES
Conventional	 radiography	 has	 been	 a	 valuable	 tool	 in	 the	 diagnosis	
and	 staging	 of	 articular	 disorders.	 Plain	 x-rays	 are	 most	 appropriate	
and	cost	effective	when	there	is	a	history	of	trauma,	suspected	chronic	
infection,	 progressive	 disability,	 or	 monarticular	 involvement;	 when	
therapeutic	 alterations	 are	 considered;	 or	 when	 a	 baseline	 assess-
ment	 is	 desired	 for	 what	 appears	 to	 be	 a	 chronic	 process.	 However,	
in	acute	inflammatory	arthritis,	early	radiography	is	rarely	helpful	in	
establishing	 a	 diagnosis	 and	 may	 only	 reveal	 soft	 tissue	 swelling	 or	
juxtaarticular	demineralization.	As	the	disease	progresses,	calcification	
(of	soft	tissues,	cartilage,	or	periarticular	bone),	joint	space	narrowing,

optimal	imaging	modality,	technique,	or	positioning	to	optimize	inter-

sitivity	 and	 facilitate	 early	 diagnosis	 in	 a	 limited	 number	 of	 articular

and	 enhanced	 site-specific	 transducers	 now	 allow	 for	 wider	 use	 and	
diagnostic	 specificity,	 especially	 when	 considering	 synovial	 (Baker’s)	
cysts,	rotator	cuff	tears,	tendinitis	and	tendon	injury,	and	crystal	depo-
sition	on	cartilage.	Use	of	power	Doppler	allows	for	early	detection	of	
synovitis	and	bony	erosions.	Radionuclide scintigraphy	is	a	very	sensi-
tive,	but	poorly	specific,	means	of	detecting	inflammatory	or	metabolic	
alterations	in	bone	or	periarticular	soft	tissue	structures	(Table	370-5).	
Scintigraphy	is	best	suited	for	total-body	assessment	(extent	and	dis-
tribution)	of	skeletal	involvement	(neoplasia,	Paget’s	disease)	and	the	
assessment	 of	 patients	 with	 undiagnosed	 polyarthralgias,	 looking	 for	
occult	arthritis.	The	use	of	scintigraphy	has	declined	with	greater	use	
and	 declining	 cost	 of	 ultrasound	 and	 MRI.	 MRI	 has	 largely	 replaced	
scintigraphy	in	diagnosing	osseous	infection,	neoplasia,	inflammation,	
increased	 blood	 flow,	 bone	 remodeling,	 heterotopic	 bone	 formation,	
or	avascular	necrosis.	Gallium	scanning	uses	67Ga,	which	binds	serum	
and	cellular	transferrin	and	lactoferrin	and	is	preferentially	taken	up	by	
neutrophils,	macrophages,	bacteria,	and	tumor	tissue	(e.g.,	lymphoma).	
As	such,	it	is	primarily	used	in	the	identification	of	occult	infection	or	
malignancy.	Scanning	with	111In-labeled	WBCs	has	been	used	to	detect	
osteomyelitis	 and	 infectious	 or	 inflammatory	 arthritis.	 Despite	 their	
utility,	111In-labeled	WBC	and	67Ga	scanning	have	largely	been	replaced	
by	MRI,	except	when	there	is	a	suspicion	of	septic	joint	or	prosthetic	
joint	infections.

Computed  tomography	 (CT)	 provides	 detailed	 visualization	 of	 the	
axial	skeleton.	Articulations	previously	considered	difficult	to	visualize	
by	 radiography	 (e.g.,	 zygapophyseal,	 sacroiliac,	 sternoclavicular,	 hip	
joints)	can	be	evaluated	using	CT.	CT	has	been	demonstrated	to	be	use-
ful	in	the	diagnosis	of	low	back	pain	(e.g.,	spinal	stenosis	vs	herniated	
disk),	sacroiliitis,	osteoid	osteoma,	and	stress	fractures.	Helical	or	spiral	
CT	(with	or	without	contrast	angiography)	is	a	novel	technique	that	is	
rapid,	cost	effective,	and	sensitive	in	diagnosing	pulmonary	embolism	
or	obscure	fractures,	often	in	the	setting	of	initially	equivocal	findings.	
High-resolution	CT	can	be	advocated	in	the	evaluation	of	suspected	or	
established	 infiltrative	 lung	 disease	 (e.g.,	 scleroderma	 or	 rheumatoid	
lung).	The	recent	use	of	hybrid	(positron	emission	tomography	[PET]	
or	single-photon	emission	CT	[SPECT])	CT	scans	in	metastatic	evalu-
ations	has	incorporated	CT	to	provide	better	anatomic	localization	of	
scintigraphic	abnormalities.

18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose	(FDG)	 is	 the	 most	 commonly	 used	 radio-
pharmaceutical	in	PET	scanning.	FDG-PET/CT	scans	are	rarely	indi-
cated	 in	 septic	 or	 inflammatory	 arthritis	 but	 have	 been	 useful	 in	 the	
evaluation	of	patients	with	fever	of	unknown	origin	or	suspected	large	
vessel	 vasculitis.	 For	 instance,	 while	 FDG-PET	 is	 useful	 in	 assessing	
vascular	inflammation/activity,	MRI	angiography	can	best	define	the	
extent	of	vascular	damage.	Dual-energy	CT	(DECT)	scanning,	devel-
oped	in	urology	to	identify	urinary	calculi,	has	been	a	highly	sensitive	
and	specific	method	used	to	identify	and	quantify	uric	acid	deposition	
in	tissues	(Fig. 370-7).

MRI	has	significantly	advanced	the	ability	to	image	musculoskeletal	
structures.	 MRI	 has	 the	 advantages	 of	 providing	 multiplanar	 images	
with	 fine	 anatomic	 detail	 and	 contrast	 resolution	 (Fig.  370-8)	 that	
allows	for	the	superior	ability	to	visualize	bone	marrow	and	soft	tissue	
periarticular	structures.	Although	more	costly	with	a	longer	procedural	
time	than	CT,	the	MRI	has	become	the	preferred	technique	when	eval-
uating	complex	musculoskeletal	disorders.

MRI	 can	 image	 fascia,	 vessels,	 nerve,	 muscle,	 cartilage,	 ligaments,	
tendons,	pannus,	synovial	effusions,	and	bone	marrow.	Visualization	of	
particular	structures	can	be	enhanced	by	altering	the	pulse	sequence	to	
produce	either	T1-	or	T2-weighted	spin	echo,	gradient	echo,	or	inver-
sion	recovery	(including	short	tau	inversion	recovery	[STIR])	images.	
Because	of	its	sensitivity	to	changes	in	marrow	fat,	MRI	is	a	sensitive	
but	nonspecific	means	of	detecting	osteonecrosis,	osteomyelitis,	and	mar-
row	inflammation	indicating	overlying	synovitis	or	osteitis	(Fig.	363-8).	
Because	of	its	enhanced	soft	tissue	resolution,	MRI	is	more	sensitive	
than	arthrography	or	CT	in	the	diagnosis	of	soft	tissue	injuries	(e.g.,	
meniscal	and	rotator	cuff	tears);	intraarticular	derangements;	marrow	
abnormalities	(osteonecrosis,	myeloma);	and	spinal	cord	or	nerve	root	
damage,	synovitis,	or	cartilage	damage	or	loss.

FIGURE  370-8  Superior  sensitivity  of  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  in  the 
diagnosis  of  osteonecrosis  of  the  femoral  head.  A  45-year-old  woman  receiving 
high-dose  glucocorticoids  developed  right  hip  pain.  Conventional  x-rays  (top) 
demonstrated  only  mild  sclerosis  of  the  right  femoral  head.  T1-weighted  MRI 
(bottom) demonstrated low-density signal in the right femoral head, diagnostic of 
osteonecrosis.

Osteoarthritis	 (OA)	 is	 the	 most	 common	 type	 of	 arthritis.	 Its	 high	
prevalence,	especially	in	the	elderly,	and	its	negative	impact	on	physical	
function	 make	 it	 a	 leading	 cause	 of	 disability	 in	 the	 elderly.	 Because	
of	the	aging	of	Western	populations	and	because	obesity,	a	major	risk

joint	 (MTP)	 and	 cervical	 and	 lumbosacral	 spine.	 In	 the	 hands,	 the	
distal	and	proximal	interphalangeal	joints	and	the	base	of	the	thumb	
are	often	affected.	Usually	spared	are	the	wrist,	elbow,	and	ankle.	Our	
joints	 were	 designed,	 in	 an	 evolutionary	 sense,	 for	 brachiating	 apes,	
animals	that	still	walked	on	four	limbs.	We	thus	develop	OA	in	joints	
that	were	ill	designed	for	human	tasks	such	as	pincer	grip	(OA	in	the	
thumb	base)	and	walking	upright	(OA	in	knees	and	hips).	Some	joints,	
like	the	ankles,	may	be	spared	because	their	articular	cartilage	may	be	
uniquely	resistant	to	loading	stresses.

OA	can	be	diagnosed	based	on	structural	abnormalities	or	on	the	
symptoms	 these	 abnormalities	 evoke.	 According	 to	 cadaveric	 stud-
ies,	 by	 elderly	 years,	 structural	 changes	 of	 OA	 are	 nearly	 universal.	
These	 include	 cartilage	 loss	 (seen	 as	 joint	 space	 loss	 on	 x-rays)	 and	
osteophytes.	 Many	 persons	 with	 x-ray	 evidence	 of	 OA	 have	 no	 joint	
symptoms,	 and	 although	 the	 prevalence	 of	 structural	 abnormalities	
is	 of	 interest	 in	 understanding	 disease	 pathogenesis,	 what	 matters	
more	from	a	clinical	perspective	is	the	prevalence	of	symptomatic	OA.	
Symptoms,	usually	joint	pain,	determine	disability,	visits	to	clinicians,	
and	disease	costs.

Symptomatic	OA	of	the	knee	(pain	on	most	days	of	a	recent	month	
plus	x-ray	evidence	of	OA	in	that	knee)	occurs	in	~12%	of	persons	age	
≥60	in	the	United	States	and	6%	of	all	adults	age	≥30.	Symptomatic	hip	
OA	is	roughly	one-third	as	common	as	disease	in	the	knee.	Although	
radiographic	 hand	 OA	 and	 the	 appearance	 of	 bony	 enlargement	 in	
affected	hand	joints	(Fig. 371-2)	are	extremely	common	in	older	per-
sons,	most	affected	persons	have	no	pain.	Even	so,	painful	hand	OA	
occurs	in	~10%	of	elderly	individuals	and	often	produces	measurable	
limitation	in	function.

The	 prevalence	 of	 OA	 rises	 strikingly	 with	 age,	 being	 uncommon	
in	adults	aged	<40	and	highly	prevalent	in	those	aged	>60.	It	is	also	a	
disease	that,	at	least	in	middle-aged	and	elderly	persons,	is	much	more	
common	in	women	than	in	men.

X-ray	evidence	of	OA	is	common	in	the	lower	back	and	neck,	but	
back	pain	and	neck	pain	have	not	been	tied	to	findings	of	OA	on	x-ray.	
Thus,	back	pain	and	neck	pain	are	treated	separately	(Chap. 17).
 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
With	the	aging	of	the	populations,	both	the	prevalence	of	OA	and	the	
amount	 of	 disability	 worldwide	 related	 to	 OA	 have	 been	 increasing,	
especially	in	developed	countries	where	many	are	living	into	old	age.	Hip	

FIGURE 371-2  Severe osteoarthritis of the hands affecting the distal interphalangeal 
joints  (Heberden’s  nodes)  and  the  proximal  interphalangeal  joints  (Bouchard’s 
nodes). There is no clear bony enlargement of the other common site in the hands, 
the thumb base.

OA	is	rare	in	China	and	in	immigrants	from	China	to	the	United	States.		
However,	 OA	 in	 the	 knees	 is	 at	 least	 as	 common,	 if	 not	 more	 so,	 in	
Chinese	as	in	whites	from	the	United	States,	and	knee	OA	represents	a	
major	 cause	 of	 disability	 in	 China,	 especially	 in	 rural	 areas.	 Anatomic	
differences	between	Chinese	and	white	hips	may	account	for	much	of	the	
difference	in	hip	OA	prevalence,	with	white	hips	having	a	higher	preva-
lence	of	anatomic	predispositions	to	the	development	of	OA.

DEFINITION
OA	is	joint	failure,	a	disease	in	which	all	structures	of	the	joint	have	
undergone	 pathologic	 change,	 often	 in	 concert.	 The	 pathologic	 sine	
qua	non	of	disease	is	hyaline	articular	cartilage	loss,	present	in	a	focal	
and,	initially,	nonuniform	manner.	This	is	accompanied	by	increasing	
thickness	and	sclerosis	of	the	subchondral	bony	plate,	by	outgrowth	of	
osteophytes	at	the	joint	margin,	by	stretching	of	the	articular	capsule,	
by	variable	degrees	of	synovitis,	and	by	weakness	of	muscles	bridging	
the	joint.	In	knees,	meniscal	degeneration	is	part	of	the	disease.	There	
are	numerous	pathways	that	lead	to	joint	failure,	but	the	initial	step	is	
often	joint	injury	in	the	setting	of	a	failure	of	protective	mechanisms.

JOINT PROTECTIVE MECHANISMS  
AND THEIR FAILURE
Joint	 protectors	 include	 joint	 capsule	 and	 ligaments,	 muscle,	 sensory	
afferents,	 and	 underlying	 bone.	 Joint	 capsule	 and	 ligaments	 serve	 as	
joint	 protectors	 by	 providing	 a	 limit	 to	 excursion,	 thereby	 fixing	 the	
range	of	joint	motion.

Synovial	 fluid	 reduces	 friction	 between	 articulating	 cartilage	 sur-
faces,	thereby	serving	as	a	protector	against	friction-induced	cartilage	
wear.	 This	 lubrication	 function	 depends	 on	 hyaluronic  acid	 and	 on	
lubricin,	 a	 mucinous	 glycoprotein	 secreted	 by	 synovial	 fibroblasts	
whose	 concentration	 diminishes	 after	 joint	 injury	 and	 in	 the	 face	 of	
synovial	inflammation.

The	 ligaments,	 along	 with	 overlying	 skin	 and	 tendons,	 contain	
mechanoreceptor	 sensory	 nerves.	 These	 mechanoreceptors	 fire	 at	
different	 frequencies	 throughout	 a	 joint’s	 range	 of	 motion,	 providing	
feedback	by	way	of	the	spinal	cord	to	muscles	and	tendons.	As	a	con-
sequence,	these	muscles	and	tendons	can	assume	the	right	tension	at	
appropriate	points	in	joint	excursion	to	act	as	optimal	joint	protectors,	
anticipating	joint	loading.

Muscles	and	tendons	that	bridge	the	joint	are	key	joint	protectors.	
Focal	stress	across	the	joint	is	minimized	by	muscle	contraction	that	
decelerates	the	joint	before	impact	and	assures	that	when	joint	impact	
arrives,	it	is	distributed	broadly	across	the	joint	surface.

Failure	of	these	joint	protectors	increases	the	risk	of	joint	injury	and	
OA.	For	example,	in	animals,	OA	develops	rapidly	when	a	sensory	nerve	
to	the	joint	is	sectioned	and	joint	injury	induced.	Similarly,	in	humans,	
Charcot’s	 arthropathy,	 a	 severe	 and	 rapidly	 progressive	 OA,	 develops	
when	 minor	 joint	 injury	 occurs	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 posterior	 column	

HPIM21e_Part11_p2671-p2880.indd   2855

2856 peripheral	neuropathy.	Another	example	of	joint	protector	failure	is	rup-
ture	of	ligaments,	a	well-known	cause	of	the	early	development	of	OA.
 ■ CARTILAGE AND ITS ROLE IN JOINT FAILURE
In	addition	to	being	a	primary	target	tissue	for	disease,	cartilage	also	
functions	as	a	joint	protector.	A	thin	rim	of	tissue	at	the	ends	of	two	
opposing	bones,	cartilage	is	lubricated	by	synovial	fluid	to	provide	an	
almost	 frictionless	 surface	 across	 which	 these	 two	 bones	 move.	 The	
compressible	stiffness	of	cartilage	compared	to	bone	provides	the	joint	
with	impact-absorbing	capacity.

The	earliest	changes	of	OA	may	occur	in	cartilage,	and	abnormali-
ties	there	can	accelerate	disease	development.	The	two	major	macro-
molecules	in	cartilage	are	type	2	collagen,	which	provides	cartilage	its	
tensile	 strength,	 and	 aggrecan,	 a	 proteoglycan	 macromolecule	 linked	
with	 hyaluronic	 acid,	 which	 consists	 of	 highly	 negatively	 charged	
glycosaminoglycans.	 In	 normal	 cartilage,	 type	 2	 collagen	 is	 woven	
tightly,	constraining	the	aggrecan	molecules	in	the	interstices	between	
collagen	 strands,	 forcing	 these	 highly	 negatively	 charged	 molecules	
into	 close	 proximity.	 The	 aggrecan	 molecule,	 through	 electrostatic	
repulsion	 of	 its	 negative	 charges,	 gives	 cartilage	 its	 compressive	 stiff-
ness.	 Chondrocytes,	 the	 cells	 within	 this	 avascular	 tissue,	 synthesize	
all	 elements	 of	 the	 matrix	 and	 produce	 enzymes	 that	 break	 it	 down		
(Fig.  371-3).	 Cartilage	 matrix	 synthesis	 and	 catabolism	 are	 in	 a	
dynamic	 equilibrium	 influenced	 by	 the	 cytokine	 and	 growth	 factor	
environment.	Mechanical	and	osmotic	stress	on	chondrocytes	induces	
these	cells	to	alter	gene	expression	and	increase	production	of	inflam-
matory	cytokines	and	matrix-degrading	enzymes.	While	chondrocytes	
synthesize	 numerous	 enzymes,	 matrix	 metalloproteinases	 (MMPs;	
especially	 collagenases	 and	 ADAMTS-5)	 are	 critical	 enzymes	 in	 the	
breakdown	of	cartilage	matrix.

Local	 inflammation	 accelerates	 the	 development	 and	 progression	
of	 osteoarthritis	 and	 increases	 the	 likelihood	 that	 an	 osteoarthritic	
joint	 will	 be	 painful.	 Some	 of	 this	 inflammation	 may	 be	 induced	 by	
mechanical	 stimuli,	 so	 called	 mechanoinflammation.	 The	 synovium,	
cartilage,	and	bone	all	influence	disease	development	through	cytok-
ines,	chemokines,	and	even	complement	activation	(Fig.	371-3).	These	
act	 on	 chondrocyte	 cell-surface	 receptors	 and	 ultimately	 have	 tran-
scriptional	effects.	Matrix	fragments	released	from	cartilage	stimulate	
synovitis.	Inflammatory	cytokines	such	as	interleukin	1β	(IL-1β)	and	
tumor	 necrosis	 factor	 α	 (TNF-α)	 induce	 chondrocytes	 to	 synthesize	
prostaglandin	E2	and	nitric	oxide.	At	early	stages	in	the	matrix	response	
to	injury,	the	net	effect	of	cytokine	stimulation	may	be	matrix	synthe-
sis,	but	ultimately,	the	combination	of	effects	on	chondrocytes	triggers	
matrix	degradation.	Enzymes	in	the	matrix	are	held	in	check	by	activa-
tion	inhibitors,	including	tissue	inhibitor	of	metalloproteinase	(TIMP).	

Growth	 factors	 are	 also	 part	 of	 this	 complex	 network,	 with	 bone	
morphogenetic	protein	2	(BMP-2)	and	transforming	growth	factor	β	
(TGF-β)	 playing	 prominent	 roles	 in	 stimulating	 the	 development	 of	
osteophytes.	Whereas	healthy	articular	cartilage	is	avascular	in	part	due	
to	angiogenesis	inhibitors	present	in	cartilage,	disease	is	characterized	
by	the	invasion	of	blood	vessels	into	cartilage	from	underlying	bone.	
This	is	influenced	by	vascular	endothelial	growth	factor	(VEGF)	syn-
thesis	in	the	cartilage	and	bone.	With	these	blood	vessels	come	nerves	
that	may	bring	nociceptive	innervation.

With	 aging,	 articular	 chondrocytes	 exhibit	 a	 decline	 in	 synthetic	
capacity,	 but	 they	 produce	 proinflammatory	 mediators	 and	 matrix-	
degrading	 enzymes,	 findings	 characteristic	 of	 a	 senescent	 secretory	
phenotype.	These	chondrocytes	are	unable	to	maintain	tissue	homeo-
stasis	(such	as	after	insults	of	a	mechanical	or	inflammatory	nature).	
Thus,	with	age,	cartilage	is	easily	damaged	by	minor	sometimes	unno-
ticed	injuries,	including	those	that	are	part	of	daily	activities.

OA	cartilage	is	characterized	by	gradual	depletion	of	aggrecan,	an	
unfurling	of	the	tightly	woven	collagen	matrix,	and	loss	of	type	2	col-
lagen.	With	these	changes	comes	increasing	vulnerability	of	cartilage,	
which	loses	its	compressive	stiffness.

RISK FACTORS
Joint	vulnerability	and	joint	loading	are	the	two	major	factors	contrib-
uting	to	the	development	of	OA.	On	the	one	hand,	a	vulnerable	joint	
whose	protectors	are	dysfunctional	can	develop	OA	with	minimal	lev-
els	of	loading,	perhaps	even	levels	encountered	during	everyday	activ-
ities.	On	the	other	hand,	in	a	young	joint	with	competent	protectors,	a	
major	acute	injury	or	long-term	overloading	is	necessary	to	precipitate	
disease.	Risk	factors	for	OA	can	be	understood	in	terms	of	their	effect	
either	on	joint	vulnerability	or	on	loading	(Fig. 371-4).
 ■ SYSTEMIC RISK FACTORS THAT  
AFFECT JOINT VULNERABILITY
Age	 is	 the	 most	 potent	 risk	 factor	 for	 OA.	 Radiographic	 evidence	 of	
OA	is	rare	in	individuals	aged	<40;	however,	in	some	joints,	such	as	the	
hands,	OA	occurs	in	>50%	of	persons	aged	>70.	Aging	increases	joint	
vulnerability	through	several	mechanisms.	Whereas	dynamic	loading	
of	joints	stimulates	matrix	synthesis	by	chondrocytes	in	young	carti-
lage,	aged	cartilage	is	less	responsive	to	these	stimuli.	Partly	because	of	
this	failure	to	synthesize	matrix	with	loading,	cartilage	thins	with	age,	
and	thinner	cartilage	experiences	higher	shear	stress	and	is	at	greater	
risk	of	cartilage	damage.	Also,	joint	protectors	fail	more	often	with	age.	
Muscles	 that	 bridge	 the	 joint	 become	 weaker	 with	 age	 and	 respond	
less	 quickly	 to	 oncoming	 impulses.	 Sensory	 nerve	 input	 slows	 with	
age,	retarding	the	feedback	loop	of	mechanoreceptors	to	muscles	and

or increase risk by the load they put on the joint. Usually, a combination of loading

tendons	related	to	their	tension	and	position.	Ligaments	stretch	with	
age,	making	them	less	able	to	absorb	impulses.	These	factors	work	in	
concert	to	increase	the	vulnerability	of	older	joints	to	OA.

Older	women	are	at	high	risk	of	OA	in	all	joints,	a	risk	that	increases	
as	women	reach	their	sixth	decade.	Although	hormone	loss	with	meno-
pause	may	contribute	to	this	risk,	there	is	little	understanding	of	the	
unique	vulnerability	of	older	women	versus	men.
 ■ HERITABILITY AND GENETICS AND THEIR 
RELATION TO JOINT VULNERABILITY

OA	is	a	highly	heritable	disease,	but	its	heritability	is	joint	spe-
cific.	Fifty	percent	of	the	hand	and	hip	OA	in	the	community	is	
attributable	 to	 inheritance,	 that	 is,	 to	 disease	 present	 in	 other	
members	of	the	family.	However,	the	heritable	proportion	of	knee	OA	
is	 at	 most	 30%,	 with	 some	 studies	 suggesting	 no	 heritability	 at	 all.	
Whereas	 many	 people	 with	 OA	 have	 disease	 in	 multiple	 joints,	 this	
“generalized	 OA”	 phenotype	 is	 rarely	 inherited	 and	 is	 more	 often	 a	
consequence	of	aging.

Emerging	 evidence	 has	 identified	 genetic	 mutations	 that	 confer	
a	high	risk	of	OA.	The	best	replicated	is	a	polymorphism	within	the	
growth	differentiation	factor	5	(GDF5)	gene	whose	effect	is	to	diminish	
the	quantity	of	GDF5.	GDF5	affects	joint	shape,	which	is	likely	to	be	the	
mechanism	by	which	genes	predisposing	to	OA	increase	risk	of	disease.	
Minor	abnormalities	in	joint	shape	can	make	a	joint	vulnerable	to	dam-
age	if	focal	stresses	across	the	joint	increase.
 ■ RISK FACTORS IN THE JOINT ENVIRONMENT
Some	 risk	 factors	 increase	 vulnerability	 of	 the	 joint	 through	 local	
effects	 on	 the	 joint	 environment.	 With	 changes	 in	 joint	 anatomy,	 for	
example,	load	across	the	joint	is	no	longer	distributed	evenly	across	the	
joint	surface,	but	rather	shows	an	increase	in	focal	stress.	In	the	hip,	
three	uncommon	developmental	abnormalities	occurring	in	utero	or	
in	childhood—congenital	dysplasia,	Legg-Perthes	disease,	and	slipped	
capital	 femoral	 epiphysis—leave	 a	 child	 with	 distortions	 of	 hip	 joint	
anatomy	 that	 often	 lead	 to	 OA	 later	 in	 life.	 Girls	 are	 predominantly	
affected	by	acetabular	dysplasia,	a	mild	form	of	congenital	dislocation,	
whereas	 the	 other	 abnormalities	 more	 often	 affect	 boys.	 Depending	
on	 the	 severity	 of	 the	 anatomic	 abnormalities,	 hip	 OA	 occurs	 either	
in	 young	 adulthood	 (severe	 abnormalities)	 or	 middle	 age	 (mild	
abnormalities).	 Femoroacetabular	 impingement	 can	 develop	 during	
adolescence.	It	is	a	clinical	syndrome	in	which	an	outgrowth	of	bone

the	 growth	 plate	 results	 in	 abnormal	 contact	 between	 the	 femur	 and	
acetabulum,	 especially	 during	 hip	 flexion	 and	 rotation.	 This	 leads	 to	
cartilage	and	labral	damage,	to	hip	pain,	and	ultimately	in	later	life,	to	
an	increased	risk	of	hip	OA.

Major	 injuries	 to	 a	 joint	 also	 can	 produce	 anatomic	 abnormalities	
that	leave	the	joint	susceptible	to	OA.	For	example,	a	fracture	through	
the	joint	surface	often	causes	OA	in	joints	in	which	the	disease	is	oth-
erwise	rare	such	as	the	ankle	and	the	wrist.	Avascular	necrosis	can	lead	
to	collapse	of	dead	bone	at	the	articular	surface,	producing	anatomic	
irregularities	and	subsequent	OA.

Tears	of	ligamentous	and	fibrocartilaginous	structures	that	protect	
the	joints,	such	as	the	meniscus	in	the	knee	and	the	labrum	in	the	hip,	
can	lead	to	premature	OA.	Meniscal	tears	increase	with	age	and	when	
chronic	are	often	asymptomatic	but	lead	to	adjacent	cartilage	damage	
and	accelerated	OA.	Even	injuries	in	which	the	affected	person	never	
received	 a	 diagnosis	 may	 increase	 risk	 of	 OA.	 For	 example,	 in	 the	
Framingham	Study	subjects,	men	with	a	history	of	major	knee	injury,	
but	no	surgery,	had	a	3.5-fold	increased	risk	for	subsequent	knee	OA.

Another	source	of	anatomic	abnormality	is	malalignment	across	the	
joint	(Fig. 371-5).	This	factor	has	been	best	studied	in	the	knee.	Varus	
(bowlegged)	 knees	 with	 OA	 are	 at	 exceedingly	 high	 risk	 of	 cartilage	
loss	in	the	medial	or	inner	compartment	of	the	knee,	whereas	valgus	
(knock-kneed)	malalignment	predisposes	to	rapid	cartilage	loss	in	the	
lateral	 compartment.	 Malalignment	 causes	 this	 effect	 by	 increasing	
stress	 on	 a	 focal	 area	 of	 cartilage,	 which	 then	 breaks	 down;	 it	 also	
causes	damage	to	bone	underlying	the	cartilage,	producing	bone	mar-
row	lesions	seen	on	magnetic	resonance	imaging	(MRI).	Malalignment	
in	the	knee	often	produces	such	a	substantial	increase	in	focal	stress	
within	the	knee	(as	evidenced	by	its	destructive	effects	on	subchondral	
bone)	 that	 severely	 malaligned	 knees	 may	 be	 destined	 to	 progress	
regardless	of	the	status	of	other	risk	factors.

Weakness	in	the	quadriceps	muscles	bridging	the	knee	increases	the	

risk	of	the	development	of	painful	OA	in	the	knee.

The	role	of	bone	in	serving	as	a	shock	absorber	for	impact	load	is	
not	 well	 understood,	 but	 persons	 with	 increased	 bone	 density	 are	 at	
high	risk	of	OA.	Those	with	high	bone	density	have	an	increased	risk	
of	osteophytes	at	the	joint	margin.
 ■ LOADING FACTORS
Obesity  Three	 to	 six	 times	 body	 weight	 is	 transmitted	 across	 the	
knee	during	single-leg	stance.	Any	increase	in	weight	may	be	multiplied	
by	this	factor	to	reveal	the	excess	force	across	the	knee	in	overweight	
persons	during	walking.	Obesity	is	a	well-recognized	and	potent	risk	
factor	for	the	development	of	knee	OA	and,	less	so,	for	hip	OA.	Obesity	
precedes	the	development	of	disease	and	is	not	just	a	consequence	of	
the	inactivity	present	in	those	with	disease.	It	is	a	stronger	risk	factor	
for	disease	in	women	than	in	men,	and	for	women,	the	relationship	of	
weight	to	the	risk	of	disease	is	linear,	so	that	with	each	pound	increase	
in	 weight,	 there	 is	 a	 commensurate	 increase	 in	 risk.	 Weight	 loss	 in	
women	lowers	the	risk	of	developing	symptomatic	disease.	Not	only	is

Additional	pathologic	changes	occur	in	the	capsule,	which	stretches,

Obesity’s	 effect	 on	 the	 development	 and	 progression	 of	 disease	 is	
mediated	 mostly	 through	 the	 increased	 loading	 in	 weight-bearing	
joints	that	occurs	in	overweight	persons	and	more	severe	joint	pain	in	
obese	persons.

Repeated Use of Joint and Exercise  There	are	two	categories	of	
repetitive	joint	use:	occupational	use	and	leisure	time	physical	activi-
ties.	Workers	performing	repetitive	tasks	as	part	of	their	occupations	
for	 many	 years	 are	 at	 high	 risk	 of	 developing	 OA	 in	 the	 joints	 they	
use	repeatedly.	For	example,	farmers	are	at	high	risk	for	hip	OA,	and	
miners	have	high	rates	of	OA	in	knees	and	spine.	Workers	whose	jobs	
require	 regular	 knee	 bending	 or	 lifting	 or	 carrying	 heavy	 loads	 have	
a	 high	 rate	 of	 knee	 OA.	 One	 reason	 why	 workers	 may	 get	 disease	 is	
that	 during	 long	 days	 at	 work,	 their	 muscles	 may	 gradually	 become	
exhausted,	no	longer	serving	as	effective	joint	protectors.

It	 is	 widely	 recommended	 for	 people	 to	 adopt	 an	 exercise-filled	
lifestyle,	and	long-term	studies	of	exercise	suggest	no	consistent	associ-
ation	of	exercise	with	OA	risk	in	most	persons.	However,	persons	who	
already	have	injured	joints	may	put	themselves	at	greater	risk	by	engag-
ing	in	certain	types	of	exercise.	For	example,	persons	who	have	already	
sustained	major	knee	injuries	are	at	increased	risk	of	progressive	knee	
OA	 as	 a	 consequence	 of	 running.	 In	 addition,	 compared	 to	 nonrun-
ners,	elite	runners	(professional	runners	and	those	on	Olympic	teams)	
have	high	risks	of	both	knee	and	hip	OA.	Lastly,	although	recreational	
runners	are	not	at	increased	risk	of	knee	OA,	studies	suggest	that	they	
have	a	modest	increased	risk	of	disease	in	the	hip.

PATHOLOGY
The	 pathology	 of	 OA	 provides	 evidence	 of	 the	 involvement	 of	 many	
joint	structures	in	disease.	Cartilage	initially	shows	surface	fibrillation	
and	 irregularity.	 As	 disease	 progresses,	 focal	 erosions	 develop	 there,	
and	these	eventually	extend	to	the	subjacent	bone.	With	further	pro-
gression,	 cartilage	 erosion	 down	 to	 bone	 expands	 to	 involve	 a	 larger	
proportion	of	the	joint	surface,	even	though	OA	remains	a	focal	disease	
with	nonuniform	loss	of	cartilage.

After	an	injury	to	cartilage,	chondrocytes	undergo	mitosis	and	clus-
tering.	Although	the	metabolic	activity	of	these	chondrocyte	clusters	is	
high,	the	net	effect	of	this	activity	is	to	promote	proteoglycan	depletion	
in	the	matrix	surrounding	the	chondrocytes.	This	is	because	the	cata-
bolic	activity	is	greater	than	the	synthetic	activity.	As	disease	develops,	
collagen	matrix	becomes	damaged,	the	negative	charges	of	proteogly-
cans	 get	 exposed,	 and	 cartilage	 swells	 from	 ionic	 attraction	 to	 water	
molecules.	Because	in	damaged	cartilage	proteoglycans	are	no	longer	
forced	into	close	proximity,	cartilage	does	not	bounce	back	after	load-
ing	as	it	did	when	healthy,	and	cartilage	becomes	vulnerable	to	further	
injury.	Chondrocytes	at	the	basal	level	of	cartilage	undergo	apoptosis.
With	loss	of	cartilage	comes	alteration	in	subchondral	bone.	Stim-
ulated	by	growth	factors	and	cytokines,	osteoclasts	and	osteoblasts	in	
the	bony	plate	just	underneath	cartilage	become	activated.	Bone	forma-
tion	produces	a	thickening	of	the	subchondral	plate	that	occurs	even	
before	 cartilage	 ulcerates.	 Trauma	 to	 bone	 during	 joint	 loading	 may	
be	 the	 primary	 factor	 driving	 this	 bone	 response,	 with	 healing	 from	
injury	 (including	 microcracks)	 inducing	 remodeling.	 Small	 areas	 of	
osteonecrosis	usually	exist	in	joints	with	advanced	disease.	Bone	death	
may	also	be	caused	by	bone	trauma	with	shearing	of	microvasculature,	
leading	to	a	cutoff	of	vascular	supply	to	some	bone	areas.

At	the	margin	of	the	joint,	near	areas	of	cartilage	loss,	osteophytes	
form.	These	start	as	outgrowths	of	new	cartilage,	and	with	neurovas-
cular	invasion	from	the	bone,	this	cartilage	ossifies.	Osteophytes	are	an	
important	radiographic	hallmark	of	OA.

The	synovium	produces	lubricating	fluids	that	minimize	shear	stress	
during	motion.	In	healthy	joints,	the	synovium	consists	of	a	single	dis-
continuous	layer	filled	with	fat	and	containing	two	types	of	cells,	macro-
phages	and	fibroblasts,	but	in	OA,	it	can	sometimes	become	edematous	
and	inflamed.	There	is	a	migration	of	macrophages	from	the	periphery	
into	the	tissue,	and	cells	lining	the	synovium	proliferate.	Inflammatory	
cytokines	and	alarmins	secreted	by	the	synovium	activate	chondrocytes	
to	produce	enzymes	that	accelerate	destruction	of	matrix.

becomes	edematous,	and	can	become	fibrotic.

The	 pathology	 of	 OA	 is	 not	 identical	 across	 joints.	 In	 hand	 joints	
with	severe	OA,	for	example,	there	are	often	cartilage	erosions	in	the	
center	of	the	joint	probably	produced	by	bony	pressure	from	the	oppo-
site	side	of	the	joint.

Basic	 calcium	 phosphate	 and	 calcium	 pyrophosphate	 dihydrate	
crystals	are	present	microscopically	in	most	joints	with	end-stage	OA.	
Their	role	in	osteoarthritic	cartilage	is	unclear,	but	their	release	from	
cartilage	 into	 the	 joint	 space	 and	 joint	 fluid	 likely	 triggers	 synovial	
inflammation,	 which	 can,	 in	 turn,	 produce	 release	 of	 cytokines	 and	
trigger	nociceptive	stimulation.
SOURCES OF PAIN
Because	healthy	cartilage	is	aneural,	cartilage	loss	alone	in	a	joint	is	not	
accompanied	by	pain.	Thus,	pain	in	OA	likely	arises	from	structures	
outside	 the	 cartilage.	 Innervated	 structures	 in	 the	 joint	 include	 the	
synovium,	 ligaments,	 joint	 capsule,	 muscles,	 and	 subchondral	 bone.	
Most	 of	 these	 are	 not	 visualized	 by	 x-ray,	 and	 the	 severity	 of	 x-ray	
changes	in	OA	correlates	poorly	with	pain	severity.	However,	in	later	
stages	of	OA,	loss	of	cartilage	integrity	accompanied	by	neurovascular	
invasion	may	contribute	to	pain.

Based	on	MRI	studies	in	osteoarthritic	knees	comparing	those	with	
and	without	pain	and	on	studies	mapping	tenderness	in	unanesthetized	
joints,	likely	sources	of	pain	include	synovial	inflammation,	joint	effu-
sions,	and	bone	marrow	edema.	Modest	synovitis	develops	in	many	but	
not	all	osteoarthritic	joints.	The	presence	of	synovitis	on	MRI	is	cor-
related	with	the	presence	and	severity	of	knee	pain,	and	potentially	with	
pain	sensitization.	Capsular	stretching	from	fluid	in	the	joint	stimulates	
nociceptive	fibers	there,	inducing	pain.	Increased	focal	loading	as	part	
of	the	disease	not	only	damages	cartilage	but	probably	also	injures	the	
underlying	bone.	As	a	consequence,	bone	marrow	edema	appears	on	
the	MRI;	histologically,	this	edema	signals	the	presence	of	microcracks	
and	 scar,	 which	 are	 the	 consequences	 of	 trauma.	 These	 lesions	 may	
stimulate	bone	nociceptive	fibers.	Pain	may	arise	from	outside	the	joint	
also,	including	bursae	near	the	joints.	Common	sources	of	pain	near	
the	knee	are	anserine	bursitis	and	iliotibial	band	syndrome.

Much	 of	 the	 pain	 experienced	 in	 OA	 occurs	 when	 nociceptors	 in	
the	joint	are	stimulated	during	weight-bearing	activities.	However,	the	
pain	 may	 eventually	 become	 more	 constant	 and	 present	 at	 rest,	 and	
this	suggests	other	mechanisms	contribute	to	the	pain	experience.	The	
pathologic	 changes	 of	 OA	 may	 lead	 to	 alterations	 in	 nervous	 system	
signaling	 (Chap.  17).	 Specifically,	 peripheral	 nociceptors	 can	 become	
more	 responsive	 to	 sensory	 input,	 known	 as	 peripheral	 sensitization,	
and	there	can	also	be	an	increase	in	facilitated	central	ascending	noci-
ceptive	 signaling,	 known	 as	 central	 sensitization.	 Individuals	 with	 OA	
may	 also	 have	 insufficient	 descending	 inhibitory	 modulation.	 Some	
individuals	 may	 be	 genetically	 predisposed	 to	 becoming	 sensitized;	
however,	regardless	of	the	etiology,	these	nervous	system	alterations	are	
associated	with	more	severe	pain	severity,	contribute	to	the	presence	of	
allodynia	and	hyperalgesia	in	patients	with	OA,	and	may	predispose	to	
development	of	chronic	pain.	Obesity	increases	the	severity	of	joint	pain.	
This	is	probably	because	adipose	tissue	produces	adipokines	and	other	
hormones	which	act	on	the	nervous	system	to	enhance	pain	sensitivity.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Joint	pain	from	OA	is	primarily	activity-related	in	the	early	stages	of	
the	disease.	Pain	comes	on	either	during	or	just	after	joint	use	and	then	
gradually	resolves.	Examples	include	knee	or	hip	pain	with	going	up	or	
down	stairs,	pain	in	weight-bearing	joints	when	walking,	and,	for	hand	
OA,	 pain	 when	 cooking.	 Early	 in	 disease,	 pain	 is	 episodic,	 triggered	
often	by	overactive	use	of	a	diseased	joint,	such	as	a	person	with	knee	
OA	 taking	 a	 long	 run	 and	 noticing	 a	 few	 days	 of	 pain	 thereafter.	 As	
disease	progresses,	the	pain	becomes	continuous	and	even	begins	to	be	
bothersome	at	night.	Stiffness	of	the	affected	joint	may	be	prominent,	
but	morning	stiffness	is	usually	brief	(<30	min).

In	knees,	buckling	may	occur,	in	part,	from	weakness	of	muscles	
crossing	the	joint.	Mechanical	symptoms,	such	as	buckling,	catching,	
or	locking,	could	also	signify	internal	derangement,	like	an	anterior	
cruciate	ligament	or	meniscal	tear;	however,	these	symptoms,	which

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disordersare	common	in	persons	with	knee	OA,	need	to	be	further	evaluated	
only	if	they	develop	after	an	acute	knee	injury.	In	the	knee,	pain	with	
activities	 requiring	 knee	 flexion,	 such	 as	 stair	 climbing	 and	 arising	
from	 a	 chair,	 often	 emanates	 from	 the	 patellofemoral	 compartment	
of	the	knee,	which	does	not	actively	articulate	until	the	knee	is	bent	
~35°.

OA	is	the	most	common	cause	of	chronic	knee	pain	in	persons	aged	
>45,	 but	 the	 differential	 diagnosis	 is	 long.	 Inflammatory	 arthritis	 is	
likely	if	there	is	prolonged	morning	stiffness	and	many	other	joints	are	
affected.	Bursitis	occurs	commonly	around	knees	and	hips.	A	physical	
examination	should	focus	on	whether	tenderness	is	over	the	joint	line	
(at	the	junction	of	the	two	bones	around	which	the	joint	is	articulating)	
or	outside	of	it.	Anserine	bursitis,	medial	and	distal	to	the	knee,	is	an	
extremely	 common	 cause	 of	 chronic	 knee	 pain	 that	 may	 respond	 to	
a	 glucocorticoid	 injection.	 Prominent	 nocturnal	 pain	 in	 the	 absence	

of	 end-stage	 OA	 merits	 a	 distinct	 workup.	 For	 hip	 pain,	 OA	 can	 be	
detected	 by	 loss	 of	 internal	 rotation	 on	 passive	 movement,	 and	 pain	
isolated	to	an	area	lateral	to	the	hip	joint	usually	reflects	the	presence	
of	trochanteric	bursitis.

No	blood	tests	are	routinely	indicated	for	workup	of	patients	with	
OA	unless	symptoms	and	signs	suggest	inflammatory	arthritis.	Exami-
nation	 of	 the	 synovial	 fluid	 is	 often	 more	 helpful	 diagnostically	 than	
an	x-ray.	If	the	synovial	fluid	white	count	is	>1000/μL,	inflammatory	
arthritis	or	gout	or	pseudogout	is	likely,	the	latter	two	being	also	iden-
tified	by	the	presence	of	crystals.

Neither	x-rays	nor	magnetic	resonance	imaging	are	indicated	in	the	
workup	of	OA.	They	should	be	ordered	only	when	joint	pain	and	phys-
ical	findings	are	not	typical	of	OA	or	if	pain	persists	after	inauguration	
of	 treatment	 effective	 for	 OA.	 In	 OA,	 imaging	 findings	 (Fig.  371-6)	
correlate	poorly	with	the	presence	and	severity	of	pain.	Further,	in	both

insensitive	to	cartilage	loss	and	other	early	findings.

Although	 MRI	 may	 reveal	 the	 extent	 of	 pathology	 in	 an	 osteo-
arthritic	 joint,	 it	 is	 not	 indicated	 as	 part	 of	 the	 diagnostic	 workup.	
Findings	such	as	meniscal	tears	and	cartilage	and	bone	lesions	occur	
not	only	in	most	patients	with	OA	in	the	knee,	but	also	in	most	older	
persons	 without	 joint	 pain.	 MRI	 findings	 almost	 never	 warrant	 a	
change	in	therapy.

TREATMENT
Osteoarthritis

The	goals	of	the	treatment	of	OA	are	to	alleviate	pain	and	minimize	
loss	of	physical	function.	To	the	extent	that	pain	and	loss	of	function	
are	consequences	of	inflammation,	of	weakness	across	the	joint,	and	
of	 laxity	 and	 instability,	 the	 treatment	 of	 OA	 involves	 addressing	
each	 of	 these	 impairments.	 Comprehensive	 therapy	 consists	 of	 a	
multimodality	 approach	 including	 physical	 modalities	 and	 phar-
macologic	elements.

Patients	 with	 mild	 and	 intermittent	 symptoms	 may	 need	 only	
symptomatic	management	and/or	treatments	aimed	at	weight	loss,	
physical	activity,	exercise,	and	self-management	strategies.	Patients	
with	ongoing,	disabling	pain	are	likely	to	need	both	physical	modal-
ities	and	pharmacotherapy.

Treatments	 for	 knee	 OA	 have	 been	 more	 completely	 evaluated	
than	those	for	hip	and	hand	OA	or	for	disease	in	other	joints.	Thus,	
although	 the	 principles	 of	 treatment	 are	 identical	 for	 OA	 in	 all	
joints,	 we	 shall	 focus	 below	 on	 the	 treatment	 of	 knee	 OA,	 noting	
specific	 recommendations	 for	 disease	 in	 other	 joints,	 especially	
when	they	differ	from	those	for	the	knee.	

PHYSICAL MANAGEMENT MODALITIES
Because	 OA	 is	 a	 mechanically	 driven	 disease,	 the	 mainstay	 of	
treatment	 involves	 altering	 loading	 across	 the	 painful	 joint	 and	
improving	the	function	of	joint	protectors,	so	they	can	better	dis-
tribute	load	across	the	joint.	Ways	of	lessening	focal	load	across	the	
joint	include:

1.	 Avoiding	 painful	 activities	 as	 these	 are	 usually	 activities	 that	

overload	the	joint

2.	 Improving	the	strength	and	conditioning	of	muscles	that	bridge	

the	joint	to	optimize	their	function

3.	 Unloading	the	joint,	either	by	redistributing	load	within	the	joint	
with	a	brace	or	a	splint	or	by	unloading	the	joint	during	weight	
bearing	with	a	cane	or	a	crutch

The	 simplest	 treatment	 for	 many	 patients	 is	 to	 avoid	 activities	
that	 precipitate	 pain.	 For	 example,	 for	 the	 middle-aged	 patient	
whose	 long-distance	 running	 brings	 on	 symptoms	 of	 knee	 OA,	 a	
less	 demanding	 form	 of	 weight-bearing	 activity	 may	 alleviate	 all	
symptoms.	 For	 an	 older	 person	 whose	 daily	 walks	 up	 and	 down	
hills	bring	on	knee	pain,	routing	these	away	from	hills	might	elim-
inate	symptoms.

Weight	loss	is	a	central	strategy,	particularly	for	knee	OA.	Each	
pound	of	weight	loss	may	have	a	multiplier	effect,	unloading	both	
knees	and	hips	and	probably	relieving	pain	in	those	joints.

In	 hand	 joints	 affected	 by	 OA,	 splinting,	 by	 limiting	 motion,	
often	 minimizes	 pain	 for	 patients	 with	 involvement	 especially	 in	
the	base	of	the	thumb.	Weight-bearing	joints	such	as	knees	and	hips	
can	be	unloaded	by	using	a	cane	in	the	hand	opposite	the	affected	
joint	for	partial	weight	bearing.	A	physical	therapist	can	help	teach	
the	patient	how	to	use	the	cane	optimally,	including	ensuring	that	
its	height	is	optimal	for	unloading.	Crutches	or	walkers	can	serve	a	
similar	beneficial	function.	
Exercise  Osteoarthritic	pain	in	knees	or	hips	during	weight	bear-
ing	results	in	lack	of	activity	and	poor	mobility,	and	because	OA	is	so	
common,	the	inactivity	that	results	increases	the	risk	of	cardiovascu-
lar	disease	and	obesity.	Aerobic	capacity	is	poor	in	most	elders	with	
symptomatic	knee	OA,	worse	than	others	of	the	same	age.

Weakness	 in	 muscles	 that	 bridge	 osteoarthritic	 joints	 is	 mul-
tifactorial	 in	 etiology.	 First,	 there	 is	 a	 decline	 in	 strength	 with	
age.	 Second,	 with	 limited	 mobility	 comes	 disuse	 muscle	 atrophy.	
Third,	 patients	 with	 painful	 knee	 or	 hip	 OA	 alter	 their	 gait	 to	
lessen	loading	across	the	affected	joint,	and	this	further	diminishes	
muscle	use.	Fourth,	“arthrogenous	inhibition”	may	occur,	whereby	
contraction	 of	 muscles	 bridging	 the	 joint	 is	 inhibited	 by	 a	 nerve	
afferent	feedback	loop	emanating	in	a	swollen	and	stretched	joint	
capsule;	 this	 prevents	 attainment	 of	 voluntary	 maximal	 strength.	
Because	adequate	muscle	strength	and	conditioning	are	critical	to	
joint	protection,	weakness	in	a	muscle	that	bridges	a	diseased	joint	
makes	the	joint	more	susceptible	to	further	damage	and	pain.	The	
degree	of	weakness	correlates	strongly	with	the	severity	of	joint	pain	
and	the	degree	of	physical	limitation.	One	of	the	cardinal	elements	
of	 the	 treatment	 of	 OA	 is	 to	 improve	 the	 functioning	 of	 muscles	
surrounding	the	joint.

Trials	in	knee	and	hip	OA	have	shown	that	exercise	lessens	pain	
and	 improves	 physical	 function.	 Most	 effective	 exercise	 regimens	
consist	 of	 aerobic	 and/or	 resistance	 training,	 the	 latter	 of	 which	
focuses	 on	 strengthening	 muscles	 across	 the	 joint.	 Exercises	 are	
likely	to	be	effective	especially	if	they	train	muscles	for	the	activities	
a	 person	 performs	 daily.	 Activities	 that	 increase	 pain	 in	 the	 joint	
should	be	avoided,	and	the	exercise	regimen	needs	to	be	individu-
alized	to	optimize	effectiveness.	Range-of-motion	exercises,	which	
do	not	strengthen	muscles,	and	isometric	exercises	that	strengthen	
muscles,	but	not	through	range	of	motion,	are	unlikely	to	be	effec-
tive	by	themselves.	Low-impact	exercises,	including	water	aerobics	
and	water	resistance	training,	are	often	better	tolerated	by	patients	
than	exercises	involving	impact	loading,	such	as	running	or	tread-
mill	exercises.	A	patient	should	be	referred	to	an	exercise	class	or	to	
a	therapist	who	can	create	an	individualized	regimen.	In	addition	
to	conventional	exercise	regimens,	tai	chi	may	be	effective	for	knee	
OA.	However,	there	is	no	strong	evidence	that	patients	with	hand	
OA	benefit	from	therapeutic	exercise.

Adherence	over	the	long	term	is	the	major	challenge	to	an	exer-
cise	 prescription.	 In	 trials	 involving	 patients	 with	 knee	 OA	 who	
were	 engaged	 in	 exercise	 treatment,	 from	 a	 third	 to	 over	 half	 of	
patients	stopped	exercising	by	6	months.	Less	than	50%	continued	
regular	exercise	at	1	year.	The	strongest	predictor	of	a	patient’s	con-
tinued	exercise	is	a	previous	personal	history	of	successful	exercise.	
Physicians	should	reinforce	the	exercise	prescription	at	each	clinic	
visit,	 help	 the	 patient	 recognize	 barriers	 to	 ongoing	 exercise,	 and	
identify	convenient	times	for	exercise	to	be	done	routinely.	Mobile	
health	 and	 wearable	 technologies	 are	 increasingly	 being	 used	 to	
encourage	adherence	to	exercise.	The	combination	of	exercise	with	
calorie	restriction	and	weight	loss	is	especially	effective	in	lessening	
pain.	

Correction  of  Malalignment  Malalignment	 in	 the	 frontal	 plane	
(varus-valgus)	 markedly	 increases	 the	 stress	 across	 the	 joint,	
which	can	lead	to	progression	of	disease	and	to	pain	and	disability		
(Fig.	371-5).	Correcting	varus-valgus	malalignment,	either	surgically	
or	 with	 bracing,	 may	 relieve	 pain	 in	 persons	 whose	 knees	 are	
malaligned.	However,	correcting	malalignment	is	often	very	chal-
lenging.	Fitted	braces	that	straighten	varus	knees	by	putting	valgus	
stress	across	the	knee	can	be	effective.	Unfortunately,	many	patients	
are	 unwilling	 to	 wear	 a	 realigning	 knee	 brace;	 in	 addition,	 in	
patients	with	obese	legs,	braces	may	slip	with	usage	and	lose	their	
realigning	effect.	Braces	are	indicated	for	willing	patients	who	can	
learn	to	put	them	on	correctly	and	on	whom	they	do	not	slip.	Shoes	
modified	with	rubber	hemispheres	on	the	sole	that	alter	alignment	
of	the	proximal	knee	have	shown	efficacy	in	trials	especially	if	used	
over	several	months.

Pain	 from	 the	 patellofemoral	 compartment	 of	 the	 knee	 can	 be	
caused	 by	 tilting	 of	 the	 patella	 or	 patellar	 malalignment	 with	 the	
patella	 riding	 laterally	 in	 the	 femoral	 trochlear	 groove.	 Using	 a	
patellar	brace	to	realign	the	patella,	or	tape	to	pull	the	patella	back	
into	the	trochlear	sulcus	or	reduce	its	tilt,	has	been	shown	in	con-
trolled	trials	to	lessen	patellofemoral	pain.	However,	patients	may

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disordersfind	 it	 difficult	 to	 apply	 tape,	 and	 skin	 irritation	 from	 the	 tape	 is	
common,	and	like	realigning	braces,	patellar	braces	may	slip.

Although	their	effect	on	malalignment	is	questionable,	neoprene	
sleeves	pulled	up	to	cover	the	knee	lessen	pain	and	are	easy	to	use	
and	popular	among	patients.	The	explanation	for	their	therapeutic	
effect	on	pain	is	unclear.

In	 patients	 with	 knee	 OA,	 acupuncture	 produces	 modest	 pain	
relief	compared	to	placebo	needles	and	may	be	an	adjunctive	treat-
ment,	though	placebo	effect	is	likely	high.	In	patients	with	refrac-
tory	 joint	 pain	 from	 OA,	 radiofrequency	 ablation	 of	 the	 nerves	
innervating	 the	 joint	 has	 been	 shown	 to	 provide	 prolonged	 pain	
relief,	although	long-term	safety	is	unknown.	

PHARMACOTHERAPY
Although	 approaches	 involving	 physical	 modalities	 constitute	 its	
mainstay,	 pharmacotherapy	 serves	 an	 important	 adjunctive	 role	
in	 OA	 treatment	 for	 symptom	 management.	 Available	 drugs	 are	
administered	using	oral,	topical,	and	intraarticular	routes.	To	date,	
there	are	no	available	drugs	that	alter	the	disease	process	itself.	

Acetaminophen, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), 
and  Cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2)  Inhibitors  NSAIDs	 are	 the	 most	
popular	 drugs	 to	 treat	 osteoarthritic	 pain.	 They	 can	 be	 admin-
istered	 either	 topically	 or	 orally.	 In	 clinical	 trials,	 oral	 NSAIDs	
produce	 ~30%	 greater	 improvement	 in	 pain	 than	 high-dose	 acet-
aminophen.	 Occasional	 patients	 treated	 with	 NSAIDs	 experience	
dramatic	pain	relief,	whereas	others	experience	little	improvement.	
Initially,	NSAIDs	should	be	administered	topically	or	taken	orally	
on	an	“as-needed”	basis	because	side	effects	are	less	frequent	with	
low	 intermittent	 doses.	 If	 occasional	 medication	 use	 is	 insuffi-
ciently	 effective,	 then	 daily	 treatment	 may	 be	 indicated,	 with	 an	
anti-inflammatory	dose	selected	(Table	371-1).	Patients	should	be	
reminded	 to	 take	 low-dose	 aspirin	 and	 ibuprofen	 or	 naproxen	 at	
different	times	to	eliminate	a	drug	interaction.

NSAIDs	taken	orally	have	substantial	and	frequent	side	effects,	
the	most	common	of	which	is	upper	gastrointestinal	(GI)	toxicity,	
including	dyspepsia,	nausea,	bloating,	GI	bleeding,	and	ulcer	dis-
ease.	Thirty	to	forty	percent	of	patients	experience	upper	GI	side	
effects	 so	 severe	 as	 to	 require	 discontinuation	 of	 medication.	 To	
minimize	 the	 risk	 of	 nonsteroidal-related	 GI	 side	 effects,	 patients	
should	take	NSAIDs	after	food;	if	risk	is	high,	patients	should	take	
a	gastroprotective	agent,	such	as	a	proton	pump	inhibitor.	Certain	
oral	 agents	 are	 safer	 to	 the	 stomach	 than	 others,	 including	 non-
acetylated	 salicylates	 and	 nabumetone.	 Major	 NSAID-related	 GI	
side	effects	can	occur	in	patients	who	do	not	complain	of	upper	GI	
symptoms.	 In	 one	 study	 of	 patients	 hospitalized	 for	 GI	 bleeding,	
81%	had	no	premonitory	symptoms.

Because	of	the	increased	rates	of	cardiovascular	events	associated	
with	conventional	NSAIDs	such	as	diclofenac,	many	of	these	drugs	
are	not	appropriate	long-term	treatment	choices	for	older	persons	
with	OA,	especially	those	at	high	risk	of	heart	disease	or	stroke.	The	
American	 Heart	 Association	 has	 identified	 COX-2	 inhibitors	 as	
putting	patients	at	high	risk,	although	low	doses	of	celecoxib	(≤200	
mg/d)	are	not	associated	with	an	elevation	of	risk.	The	only	conven-
tional	NSAIDs	that	appear	safe	from	a	cardiovascular	perspective	
are	naproxen	and	low-dose	celecoxib,	but	they	do	have	GI	toxicity.
There	 are	 other	 common	 side	 effects	 of	 NSAIDs,	 including	 the	
tendency	 to	 develop	 edema	 because	 of	 prostaglandin	 inhibition	 of	
afferent	 blood	 supply	 to	 glomeruli	 in	 the	 kidneys	 and,	 for	 similar	
reasons,	 a	 predilection	 toward	 reversible	 renal	 insufficiency.	 Blood	
pressure	 may	 increase	 modestly	 in	 some	 NSAID-treated	 patients.	
Oral	NSAIDs	should	not	be	used	in	patients	with	stage	IV	or	V	renal	
disease	and	should	be	used	with	caution	in	those	with	stage	III	disease.
NSAIDs	can	be	placed	into	a	gel	or	topical	solution	with	another	
chemical	modality	that	enhances	penetration	of	the	skin	barrier	cre-
ating	 a	 topical	 NSAID.	 When	 absorbed	 through	 the	 skin,	 plasma	
concentrations	are	an	order	of	magnitude	lower	than	with	the	same	
amount	 of	 drug	 administered	 orally	 or	 parenterally.	 However,	 when	
these	drugs	are	administered	topically	in	proximity	to	a	superficial	joint

(knees,	hands,	but	not	hips),	the	drug	can	be	found	in	joint	tissues	such	
as	the	synovium	and	cartilage.	Trial	results	have	varied	but	generally	
have	found	that	topical	NSAIDs	are	slightly	less	efficacious	than	oral	
agents,	but	have	far	fewer	GI	and	systemic	side	effects.	Unfortunately,	
topical	NSAIDs	often	cause	local	skin	irritation	where	the	medication	
is	applied,	inducing	redness,	burning,	or	itching	(see	Table	371-1).

The	treatment	effect	of	acetaminophen	(paracetamol)	in	OA	is	
small	and	not	considered	clinically	meaningful	(Table 371-1).	How-
ever,	for	a	minority	of	patients,	it	is	adequate	to	control	symptoms,	
in	which	case	more	toxic	drugs	such	as	NSAIDs	can	be	avoided.	
Intraarticular 
Injections:  Glucocorticoids  and  Hyaluronic 
Acid  Because	synovial	inflammation	is	likely	to	be	a	major	cause	
of	 pain	 in	 patients	 with	 OA,	 local	 anti-inflammatory	 treatments	
administered	intraarticularly	may	be	effective	in	ameliorating	pain,	
for	up	to	3	months.	Glucocorticoid	injections	provide	such	efficacy,	
but	 response	 is	 variable.	 While	 some	 patients	 having	 little	 relief	
of	 pain,	 most	 experience	 pain	 relief	 lasting	 up	 to	 several	 months.	
Synovitis,	 a	 major	 cause	 of	 joint	 pain	 in	 OA,	 may	 abate	 after	 an	
injection,	and	this	correlates	with	the	reduction	in	knee	pain	sever-
ity.	 Glucocorticoid	 injections	 are	 useful	 to	 get	 patients	 over	 acute	
flares	 of	 pain.	 Repeated	 injections	 may	 cause	 minor	 amounts	 of	
cartilage	loss	with	probably	unimportant	clinical	consequences.

Other  Classes  of  Drugs  and  Nutraceuticals  Opioids	 have	 only	
modest	 short-term	 efficacy	 in	 treating	 pain	 in	 hip	 or	 knee	 OA	
with	unclear	benefit	over	the	long-term	and,	given	concerns	about	
opioid	 dependency,	 should	 be	 avoided.	 If	 NSAIDs	 are	 ineffective,	
one	option	is	the	use	of	duloxetine,	which	has	modest	efficacy	in	
OA	and	may	be	efficacious	especially	when	knee	pain	is	part	of	a	
syndrome	of	widespread	pain.

Recent	guidelines	recommend	against	the	use	of	glucosamine	or	
chondroitin	for	OA.	Large	publicly	supported	trials	have	failed	to	
show	 that,	 compared	 with	 placebo,	 these	 compounds	 relieve	 pain	
in	persons	with	disease.

Optimal	 pharmacologic	 therapy	 for	 OA	 is	 often	 achieved	 by	
trial	 and	 error,	 with	 each	 patient	 having	 idiosyncratic	 responses	
to	specific	treatments.	Placebo	(or	contextual)	effects	may	account	
for	50%	of	more	of	treatment	effects	in	OA,	and	certain	modes	of	
treatment	 delivery	 including	 intraarticular	 injections	 have	 greater	
contextual	effects	than	others	such	as	pills.	When	medical	therapies	
have	failed	and	the	patient	has	an	unacceptable	reduction	in	their	
quality	of	life	and	ongoing	pain	and	disability,	then	at	least	for	knee	
and	hip	OA,	total	joint	arthroplasty	is	indicated.	

SURGERY
Based	on	data	from	randomized	trials,	the	efficacy	of	arthroscopic	
debridement	and	lavage	in	persons	with	OA	is	no	greater	than	that	
of	sham	surgery	for	relief	of	pain	or	disability.	Further,	if	a	meniscal	
tear	is	present,	as	is	often	the	case	in	persons	with	knee	OA,	trials	
have	shown	that	arthroscopic	meniscectomies	do	not	relieve	knee	
pain	or	improve	function	long-term	nor	do	they	reduce	catching	or	
locking	symptoms.

On	 the	 other	 hand,	 for	 patients	 with	 knee	 OA	 isolated	 to	 the	
medial	 compartment,	 operations	 to	 realign	 the	 knee	 to	 lessen	
medial	loading	can	relieve	pain.	These	include	a	high	tibial	osteot-
omy,	 in	 which	 the	 tibia	 is	 broken	 just	 below	 the	 tibial	 plateau	
and	 realigned	 to	 load	 the	 lateral,	 nondiseased	 compartment,	 or	 a	
unicompartmental	 replacement	 with	 realignment.	 Each	 surgery	
may	provide	the	patient	with	years	of	pain	relief	before	a	total	knee	
replacement	is	required.

Ultimately,	 when	 the	 patient	 with	 knee	 or	 hip	 OA	 has	 failed	
nonsurgical	 treatments	 with	 limitations	 of	 pain	 or	 function	 that	
compromise	 their	 quality	 of	 life,	 patients	 with	 reasonable	 expec-
tations	and	readiness	for	surgery	should	be	referred	for	total	knee	
or	 hip	 arthroplasty.	 These	 are	 highly	 efficacious	 operations	 that	
relieve	pain	and	improve	function	in	the	vast	majority	of	patients,	
although	pain	elimination	occurs	in	almost	all	patients	getting	a	hip	
replacement	but	only	~80%	of	those	undergoing	knee	replacement.	
Currently,	failure	rates	from	loosening	or	infection	for	both	are	~1%	
per	year,	with	higher	rates	in	obese	patients.	The	chance	of	surgical	
success	is	greater	in	centers	where	at	least	25	such	operations	are	
performed	 yearly	 or	 with	 surgeons	 who	 perform	 multiple	 opera-
tions	 annually.	 The	 timing	 of	 knee	 or	 hip	 replacement	 is	 critical.	
If	 the	 patient	 suffers	 for	 many	 years	 until	 their	 functional	 status	
has	 declined	 substantially,	 with	 considerable	 muscle	 weakness,	
postoperative	functional	status	may	not	improve	to	a	level	achieved	
by	others	who	underwent	operation	earlier	in	their	disease	course.	
Cartilage  Regeneration  Chondrocyte	 transplantation	 has	 not	
been	found	to	be	efficacious	in	OA,	perhaps	because	OA	includes	
pathology	of	joint	mechanics,	which	is	not	corrected	by	chondro-
cyte	 transplants.	 Similarly,	 abrasion	 arthroplasty	 (chondroplasty)	
has	 not	 been	 well	 studied	 for	 efficacy	 in	 OA,	 but	 it	 produces	
fibrocartilage	in	place	of	damaged	hyaline	cartilage.	Both	surgical	
attempts	to	regenerate	and	reconstitute	articular	cartilage	are	more	
likely	to	be	efficacious	early	in	disease	when	joint	malalignment	and	
many	of	the	other	noncartilage	abnormalities	that	characterize	OA	
have	not	yet	developed.

372 Gout and Other  
Crystal-Associated 
Arthropathies
Hyon K. Choi

The	use	of	polarizing	light	microscopy	during	synovial	fluid	analysis	
in	1961	by	McCarty	and	Hollander	and	the	subsequent	application	of	
other	crystallographic	techniques,	such	as	electron	microscopy,	energy-	
dispersive	 elemental	 analysis,	 and	 x-ray	 diffraction,	 have	 allowed	
investigators	to	identify	the	pathogenic	roles	of	different	microcrystals,	
including	 monosodium	 urate	 (MSU),	 calcium	 pyrophosphate	 (CPP),	
calcium	 apatite	 (apatite),	 and	 calcium	 oxalate	 (CaOx),	 in	 inducing	
acute	 or	 chronic	 arthritis	 or	 periarthritis	 (Table  372-1).	 The	 clinical	
manifestations	 that	 result	 from	 these	 crystals	 have	 substantial	 sim-
ilarities	 but	 also	 have	 notable	 differences.	 Given	 their	 therapeutic	
implications,	the	need	to	perform	synovial	fluid	analysis	to	distinguish	
the	 type	 of	 crystal	 involved	 should	 be	 emphasized.	 Polarized	 light	
microscopy	alone	can	identify	most	typical	crystals,	except	for	apatite.	
Aspiration	 and	 analysis	 of	 effusions	 are	 also	 important	 to	 assess	 the	
possibility	of	infection.	Crystal	shedding	from	inert	deposits	triggered	
by	certain	factors	is	considered	a	key	process	behind	episodic	manifes-
tation	of	acute	inflammation	(gout	or	pseudogout)	involving	activation	
of	 inflammasome	 and	 potent	 proinflammatory	 cytokines	 such	 as	
interleukin	(IL)	1β.	Furthermore,	physical,	inflammatory,	and	catalytic	
effects	(involving	metalloproteinase,	collagenase,	or	prostaglandin	E2)	
of	crystal	deposits	on	the	cartilage	and	other	joint	structures	can	lead	
to	chronic	erosive	or	destructive	changes	in	the	articular	structures.

FIGURE 372-1  Pathogenesis of gout and therapeutic targets. Metabolic and some genetic factors contribute to the development of chronic hyperuricemia. Gout stems from 
an increased body pool of urate due to chronic hyperuricemia, leading to supersaturation and crystal formation and deposition of monosodium urate (MSU; tophi) within the 
joints and connective tissue. Synovial tophi are usually walled off, but certain triggers may loosen them from the organic matrix, leading to crystal shedding and interaction 
with synovial cell lining and residential inflammatory cells, initiating an acute gout flare. In some individuals, growing MSU crystal deposition leads to chronic gouty arthritis 
with subcutaneous tophi. Anti-inflammatory therapy targets the downstream process of crystal-induced inflammation, whereas ultimate control of gout requires correction 
of the underlying central cause, chronic hyperuricemia with increased urate pool. NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; SU, sodium urate; ULT, urate-lowering 
therapy.

body	 pool	 of	 urate	 due	 to	 chronic	 hyperuricemia,	 leading	 to	 super-
saturation	 and	 crystal	 formation	 and	 deposition	 of	 MSU	 within	 the	
joints	 and	 connective	 tissue	 (Fig.  372-1).	 If	 left	 untreated,	 gout	 can	
progress	 to	 chronic	 gouty	 arthritis,	 frequently	 with	 low-grade	 per-
sistent	 synovitis	 and	 erosive	 deformities	 due	 to	 growing	 deposition	
of	 MSU	 crystals.	 Humans	 are	 the	 only	 mammals	 known	 to	 develop	
gout	 spontaneously	 as	 they	 often	 develop	 hyperuricemia	 with	 their	
evolutionary	 species-wide	 loss	 of	 uricase,	 which	 converts	 urate	 into	
the	highly	water-soluble	compound	allantoin.	Although	chronic	hype-
ruricemia	is	a	prerequisite	for	the	development	of	gout,	other	factors	
influence	 MSU	 deposition	 and	 pathogenic	 reactions	 to	 the	 crystals		
(Fig.	372-1);	a	minority	of	hyperuricemic	individuals	develop	gout	dur-
ing	their	lifetime.	At	physiologic	pH,	uric	acid	exists	largely	as	urate,	
the	ionized	form,	given	its	weak	acidic	property	(pKa,	5.8).	Considered	
as	a	part	of	the	insulin	resistance	syndrome,	hyperuricemia	and	gout	
are	 associated	 with	 multiple	 cardiovascular-metabolic	 comorbidities,	
including	obesity,	hypertension,	type	2	diabetes,	myocardial	infarction,	
stroke,	and	urate	nephrolithiasis	(Chap. 417);	modifiable	risk	factors	
include	obesity,	Western	diet,	alcohol,	sedentary	lifestyle,	and	diuretics	
(Fig.	372-1).

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Early	clinical	manifestation	of	gout	is	characterized	by	acute	recurrent	
gout	flares.	Usually,	only	one	joint	is	affected	initially,	although	oligo-	
and	polyarticular	gout	flares	can	develop	over	time.	The	metatarsopha-
langeal	joint	of	the	first	toe	is	involved	in	70–90%	of	cases	(podagra),	
followed	 by	 tarsal	 joints,	 ankles,	 and	 knees.	 Finger,	 wrist,	 and	 elbow	
joints	 can	 also	 be	 involved,	 although	 more	 often	 in	 elderly	 patients	
or	 in	 advanced	 disease.	 The	 gout	 flares	 often	 begin	 at	 night	 to	 early	
morning,	constituting	one	of	the	most	painful	conditions	experienced	
by	humans.	The	affected	joints	rapidly	become	warm,	red,	tender,	and	
substantially	swollen	with	a	clinical	appearance	that	often	mimics	that	

of	cellulitis	(pseudocellulitis).	Typical	flares	tend	to	subside	spontane-
ously	 within	 1–2	 weeks,	 and	 most	 patients	 have	 intervals	 of	 varying	
length	with	no	residual	symptoms	until	the	next	episode	(intercritical	
gout).	Triggers	of	gout	flares	include	purine-rich	food,	alcohol,	diuretic	
use,	 initial	 introduction	 of	 urate-lowering	 therapy,	 local	 trauma,	 and	
medical	 illnesses	 such	 as	 congestive	 heart	 failure	 and	 respiratory	
hypoxic	conditions	(Fig.	372-1).

Usually	after	years	of	gout	flares	without	treatment,	chronic	gouty	
arthritis	 can	 develop,	 often	 associated	 with	 ongoing	 synovitis,	 sub-
cutaneous	 tophi,	 deformity,	 and	 bony	 destruction.	 Less	 commonly,	
chronic	gouty	arthritis	will	be	the	only	manifestation,	and	more	rarely,	
gout	can	manifest	only	as	tophi.	Women	represent	only	5–20%	of	all	
patients	 with	 gout.	 Most	 women	 with	 gout	 are	 postmenopausal	 and	
elderly;	tend	to	have	osteoarthritis,	hypertension,	or	mild	renal	insuf-
ficiency;	 and	 usually	 are	 receiving	 diuretics.	 Premenopausal	 gout	 is	
rare,	 although	 kindreds	 of	 precocious	 gout	 in	 young	 women	 caused	
by	 decreased	 renal	 urate	 clearance	 and	 renal	 insufficiency	 have	 been	
described.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Laboratory  Diagnosis  Even	 if	 characteristic	 clinical	 features	
strongly	 suggest	 gout,	 the	 presumptive	 diagnosis	 ideally	 should	 be	
confirmed	 by	 needle	 aspiration	 of	 involved	 joints	 or	 tophaceous	
deposits.	Acute	septic	arthritis,	other	crystal-associated	arthropathies,	
palindromic	 rheumatism,	 and	 psoriatic	 arthritis	 can	 mimic	 clinical	
presentations	 of	 gout.	 During	 acute	 gout	 flares,	 needle-shaped	 MSU	
crystals	 typically	 are	 present	 both	 intracellularly	 and	 extracellularly	
(Fig. 372-2).	Under	compensated	polarized	light,	these	crystals	show	
bright,	negative	birefringence.	Synovial	fluid	appears	cloudy	due	to	the	
increased	 numbers	 of	 leukocytes	 (e.g.,	 from	 5000–75,000/μL).	 Large	
amounts	 of	 crystals	 occasionally	 produce	 a	 thick,	 pasty,	 chalky	 joint	
fluid	 or	 drainage	 from	 distended	 tophus.	 Because	 bacterial	 infection

can	 coexist	 with	 MSU	 crystals	 in	 synovial	 fluid,	 joint	 fluid	 is	 often	
stained	 and	 cultured	 for	 potential	 septic	 arthritis.	 MSU	 crystals	 also	
can	often	be	demonstrated	in	the	first	metatarsophalangeal	joint	and	
in	knees	not	acutely	involved	with	gout,	making	arthrocentesis	of	these	
joints	useful	for	the	diagnosis	of	gout	between	flares.

While	chronic	hyperuricemia	is	a	prerequisite	in	the	pathogenesis	of	
gout,	serum	urate	levels	can	be	normal	or	low	at	the	time	of	an	acute	
flare,	 as	 inflammatory	 cytokines’	 uricosuric	 property	 (e.g.,	 IL-6)	 can	
lower	 the	 level	 by	 ~2	 mg/dL.	 This	 tends	 to	 limit	 the	 value	 of	 serum	
urate	testing	in	the	setting	of	an	acute	flare.	Nevertheless,	serum	urate	
levels	are	almost	always	elevated	at	some	time	in	a	gout	patient’s	life-
time,	 and	 thus,	 it	 is	 important	 to	 seek	 historical	 or	 postflare	 serum	
urate	values	as	a	diagnostic	clue	or	therapeutic	target	to	urate-lowering	
therapy.	 Serum	 creatinine,	 liver	 function	 tests,	 hemoglobin,	 white	
blood	cell	(WBC)	count,	hemoglobin	A1c,	and	serum	lipids	are	usually	
obtained	 at	 baseline	 to	 assess	 possible	 risk	 factor	 and	 comorbidities	
requiring	treatment	or	monitored	for	potential	adverse	effects	of	gout	
treatments.

Radiographic  Features 
In	 plain	 radiography,	 cystic	 changes,	
well-defined	 erosions	 with	 sclerotic	 margins	 (often	 with	 overhang-
ing	 bony	 edges),	 and	 soft	 tissue	 masses	 are	 characteristic	 features	 of	
advanced	gout	with	tophaceous	deposits,	although	these	findings	are	
typically	 absent	 in	 earlier	 stages	 of	 gout.	 Musculoskeletal	 ultrasound	
can	 timely	 aid	 earlier	 diagnosis	 by	 revealing	 a	 double-contour	 sign	
overlying	the	articular	cartilage	(signifying	MSU	deposition).	Similarly,	
dual-energy	 computed	 tomography	 (CT)	 that	 utilizes	 two	 different	
energy	beams	and	identifies	MSU	based	on	its	chemical	composition	
can	indicate	specific	presence	of	MSU	crystals.

TREATMENT
Acute Gout Care

Although	nonpharmacologic	measures,	such	as	ice	pack	application	
and	rest	of	the	involved	joints,	can	be	helpful,	the	mainstay	of	acute	
gout	care	is	the	administration	of	anti-inflammatory	drugs	such	as	
nonsteroidal	 anti-inflammatory	 drugs	 (NSAIDs),	 colchicine,	 and	
glucocorticoids	 (Fig.	 372-1).	 The	 choice	 of	 these	 options	 largely	
depends	 on	 the	 patients’	 comorbidities,	 concurrent	 medications,	
and	 previous	 response	 if	 recurrent	 flares.	 Early	 initiation	 of	 anti-	
inflammatories	 helps	 abort	 or	 reduce	 the	 severity	 of	 flares.	 Thus,	
for	 recurrent	 flares	 in	 established	 gout	 patients,	 patients	 can	 be	
provided	a	supply	of	their	medications	ready	to	start	at	the	first	sign	
of	a	flare.	NSAIDs	are	used	most	often	in	individuals	without	com-
plicating	 comorbidities;	 NSAIDs	 given	 in	 full	 anti-inflammatory	
doses	are	effective	in	the	vast	majority	of	patients	(e.g.,	indometha-
cin,	 25–50	 mg	 tid;	 naproxen,	 500	 mg	 bid;	 ibuprofen,	 800	 mg	 tid;	
and	celecoxib,	800	mg	followed	by	400	mg	12	h	later,	then	400	mg	
bid).	Oral	colchicine	is	also	effective,	particularly	if	used	early	in	a	
gout	flare.	A	low-dose	regimen	(1.2	mg	with	the	first	sign	of	a	flare,	
followed	by	0.6	mg	in	1	h	and	subsequent-day	dosing	depending	on	
response)	is	as	effective	as,	and	better	tolerated	than,	the	formerly	
used	higher-dose	regimens.	Colchicine	is	eliminated	from	the	body	
through	P-glycoprotein	(also	known	as	MDR1)	in	the	liver,	small	
intestine,	and	kidneys	as	well	as	via	enteric	and	hepatic	cytochrome	
P450	3E4	(CYP3A4).	As	such,	the	dose,	particularly	for	prolonged	
use,	 is	 reduced	 among	 patients	 with	 renal	 disease	 or	 when	 used	
with	P-glycoprotein	or	CYP3A4	inhibitors	such	as	clarithromycin	
or	tacrolimus;	additional	caution	is	warranted	among	patients	with	
hepatorenal	impairment.

Glucocorticoids	 given	 as	 an	 intramuscular	 injection	 or	 orally	
(e.g.,	 prednisone,	 30–50	 mg/d	 as	 the	 initial	 dose	 and	 gradually	
tapered	 with	 the	 resolution	 of	 the	 attack)	 can	 be	 effective	 even	
in	 polyarticular	 gout.	 For	 a	 single	 joint	 or	 a	 few	 involved	 joints,	
intraarticular	glucocorticoid	injection	is	effective	and	well	tolerated.	
With	the	central	role	of	the	inflammasome	and	IL-1β	in	gout	flares,	
anakinra	is	a	useful	option	when	other	treatments	are	contraindi-
cated	or	have	failed.	
URATE-LOWERING THERAPY
Ultimate	control	of	gout	requires	correction	of	the	underlying	chronic	
hyperuricemia,	 the	 central	 cause	 for	 gout.	 Attempts	 to	 normalize	
serum	urate	to	a	subsaturation	point	(typically,	<300–360	μmol/L	
[5.0–6.0	 mg/dL])	 to	 prevent	 recurrent	 gout	 flares	 and	 eliminate	
tophi	are	critical	and	entail	a	commitment	to	urate-lowering	regi-
mens	that	are	required	usually	for	life	(Fig.	372-1).	Urate-lowering	
drug	therapy	should	be	considered	when,	as	in	most	patients,	the	
hyperuricemia	 cannot	 be	 corrected	 by	 risk	 factor	 interventions	
(control	 of	 body	 weight,	 healthy	 diet,	 limitation	 of	 alcohol	 use,	
decreased	consumption	of	fructose-rich	foods	and	beverages,	and	
avoidance	of	thiazide	and	loop	diuretics).	The	decision	to	initiate	
urate-lowering	drug	therapy	usually	is	made	considering	the	num-
ber	of	gout	flares	(urate	lowering	may	be	cost-effective	with	more	
than	 two	 attacks	 yearly),	 severity	 and	 duration	 of	 flares,	 quality	
of	 life,	 or	 the	 patient’s	 willingness	 to	 commit	 to	 lifelong	 therapy.	
Urate-lowering	 therapy	 should	 be	 initiated	 in	 any	 patient	 who	
already	has	subcutaneous	tophi	or	chronic	gouty	arthritis	or	known	
uric	acid	stones.

Allopurinol,	 a	 xanthine	 oxidase	 inhibitor,	 is	 the	 first-line	
urate-lowering	drug	among	gout	patients.	Allopurinol	can	be	given	
in	 a	 single	 morning	 dose,	 starting	 at	 100	 mg	 daily	 or	 less	 and	
titrating	up	(to	800	mg	daily)	to	achieve	a	target	serum	urate	level	
<5–6	mg/dL	(i.e.,	a	subsaturation	point	of	MSU	crystals).	In	patients	
with	 chronic	 kidney	 disease	 (CKD),	 the	 starting	 allopurinol	 dose	
should	be	lowered	depending	on	the	CKD	levels;	for	example,	with	
an	estimated	glomerular	filtration	rate	of	30–45	mL/min,	one	would	
start	at	50	mg	daily	and	titrate	up	slowly.	Starting	at	a	low	dose	and	
titrating	up	reduces	the	risk	of	severe	cutaneous	adverse	reactions	
(SCARs),	 including	 Stevens-Johnson	 syndrome	 and	 toxic	 epider-
mal	 necrolysis,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 risk	 of	 gout	 flares	 associated	 with	
rapid	serum	urate	reduction	due	to	introduction	of	urate-lowering	
therapy	 (Fig.	 372-1).	 Allopurinol	 is	 generally	 well	 tolerated,	 but	
mild	 cutaneous	 reactions	 can	 develop	 in	 ~2%	 of	 users.	 SCARs	 to	
allopurinol	are	rare	but	can	be	life-threatening,	and	thus,	appropri-
ate	precaution	is	advised.	Presence	of	CKD,	higher	allopurinol	ini-
tial	dosing	(e.g.,	>100	mg	daily	in	CKD	patients),	and	HLA-B*5801	
carriage	are	important	risk	factors;	older	age	and	female	sex	are	also	
associated	with	a	higher	risk	of	SCARs.	As	the	HLA-B*5801	carriage	
rate	 is	 substantially	 higher	 among	 Southeast	 Asians	 (except	 for	 	
Japanese	 descendants),	 Pacific	 Islanders/Native	 Hawaiians,	 and	
blacks	than	whites	or	Hispanics	(leading	to	racial	disparity	in	the	
risk	 of	 SCARs),	 screening	 for	 HLA-B*5801	 should	 be	 performed	
before	 starting	 allopurinol	 in	 those	 Asians	 and	 blacks.	 If	 patients	
carry	 the	 HLA-B*5801	 allele,	 an	 alternative	 urate-lowering	 agent	
should	 be	 administered.	 Febuxostat	 is	 a	 newer	 xanthine	 oxidase	
inhibitor	that	is	predominantly	metabolized	by	glucuronide	forma-
tion	and	oxidation	in	the	liver	and	considered	to	not	require	dose	
adjustment	in	moderate	to	severe	chronic	kidney	disease.	It	has	also	
been	used	in	patients	who	carry	the	HLA-B*5801	allele.

Uricosuric	agents	such	as	probenecid	are	considered	second-line	
urate-lowering	therapies	for	gout	and	can	be	used	in	patients	with	
good	renal	function	either	alone	or	in	combination	with	xanthine	
oxidase	 inhibitors	 such	 as	 allopurinol.	 Probenecid	 can	 be	 started	
at	a	dose	of	250	mg	twice	daily	and	increased	gradually	as	needed	
up	 to	 3	 g/d	 to	 achieve	 and	 maintain	 a	 target	 serum	 urate	 level.	
Probenecid	is	generally	not	effective	in	patients	with	serum	creatin-
ine	levels	>177	μmol/L	(2	mg/dL).	Benzbromarone	(not	available	in	
the	United	States)	is	another	uricosuric	drug	that	is	more	effective	
in	 patients	 with	 CKD.	 In	 contrast	 to	 thiazide	 and	 loop	 diuretics,	
which	 increase	 serum	 urate	 levels	 and	 trigger	 gout	 attacks,	 other	
drugs	 used	 to	 treat	 common	 comorbidities	 of	 gout	 can	 also	 help	
lower	 serum	 urate	 levels,	 including	 losartan,	 amlodipine,	 fenofi-
brate,	and	sodium-glucose	cotransporter-2	inhibitors.	Pegloticase	is	
a	pegylated	uricase	that	is	available	for	patients	who	do	not	tolerate	
or	fail	full	doses	of	other	treatments.

Urate-lowering	 drugs	 are	 generally	 not	 initiated	 during	 active	
ongoing	 gout	 flares,	 given	 the	 potential	 worsening	 of	 the	 flare	 by	
acutely	lowering	serum	urate	levels.	However,	urate-lowering	ther-
apy	 can	 be	 started	 during	 the	 resolution	 phase	 of	 or	 after	 a	 gout	
flare,	together	with	anti-inflammatory	prophylaxis	(e.g.,	colchicine	
0.6	mg	one	to	two	times	daily	or	naproxen	250	mg	twice	daily)	to	
reduce	the	risk	of	the	flares	that	often	occur	with	the	initiation	of	
urate-lowering	 therapy.	 These	 paradoxical	 flares	 are	 presumed	 to	
be	inflammatory	reactions	to	MSU	crystals	shed	from	dissolution	
of	 organized	 MSU	 deposits	 (synovial	 tophi)	 induced	 by	 rapid	
serum	urate	reduction	(Fig.	372-1).	As	such,	faster	urate	reduction	
has	 been	 associated	 with	 higher	 risk	 of	 flares	 in	 clinical	 trials	 of	
urate-lowering	 drugs.	 Continuing	 concomitant	 anti-inflammatory	
prophylaxis	is	usually	recommended	until	the	patient	is	normouri-
cemic	and	without	gouty	attacks	for	3–6	months	or	tophi	disappear.

CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE  
DEPOSITION DISEASE
CPP	 deposition	 (CPPD)	 predominately	 affects	 the	 elderly,	 with	 a	
doubling	 prevalence	 of	 CPPD	 in	 articular	 tissues	 with	 each	 decade		
>60	years	of	age	(e.g.,	prevalence	of	nearly	50%	for	those	>85	years	old).

  Gout
  X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets
  Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia

In	most	cases,	this	process	is	asymptomatic	with	uncertain	underlying	
etiology,	 although	 it	 is	 likely	 that	 biochemical	 changes	 in	 aging	 or	
diseased	 cartilage	 favor	 CPP	 crystal	 nucleation.	 Increased	 levels	 of	
inorganic	pyrophosphate	in	cartilage	matrix	are	thought	to	be	a	cen-
tral	pathogenic	process	in	patients	with	CPPD	arthritis,	analogous	to	
hyperuricemia	in	gout.	This	pyrophosphate	can	combine	with	calcium	
to	form	CPP	crystals	in	cartilage	matrix	vesicles	or	on	collagen	fibers.	
Most	 inorganic	 pyrophosphate	 in	 cartilage	 matrix	 originates	 from	
breakdown	of	extracellular	ATP.	The	ATP	efflux	(and	thus	the	levels	of	
inorganic	pyrophosphate)	is	tightly	regulated	by	a	multipass	membrane	
protein,	ANKH.	As	such,	mutations	in	the	ANKH	gene,	as	described	
in	both	familial	and	sporadic	cases,	have	been	found	to	increase	elab-
oration	and	extracellular	transport	of	pyrophosphate.	The	increase	in	
pyrophosphate	production	is	also	related	to	enhanced	activity	of	ATP	
pyrophosphohydrolase	 and	 5′-nucleotidase,	 which	 catalyze	 the	 reac-
tion	of	ATP	to	adenosine	and	pyrophosphate.	Decreased	levels	of	car-
tilage	glycosaminoglycans	and	increased	activities	of	transglutaminase	
enzymes	may	contribute	to	the	deposition	of	CPP	crystals.

Similar	 to	 MSU	 crystals,	 release	 of	 CPP	 crystals	 into	 the	 joint	
space	is	followed	by	the	phagocytosis	of	those	crystals	by	monocyte-	
macrophages	and	neutrophils,	which	respond	by	releasing	chemotactic	
and	inflammatory	substances	and	activating	the	inflammasome.

A	 minority	 of	 patients	 with	 CPPD	 arthropathy	 have	 metabolic	
abnormalities	 or	 hereditary	 CPPD	 (Table  372-2).	 As	 such,	 the	 pres-
ence	 of	 CPPD	 arthritis	 in	 individuals	 aged	 <50	 years	 should	 lead	 to	
consideration	of	these	metabolic	disorders	and	inherited	forms	of	dis-
ease,	including	those	identified	in	a	variety	of	ethnic	groups.	Included	
among	 endocrine-metabolic	 conditions	 are	 hyperparathyroidism,	
hemochromatosis,	 hypophosphatasia,	 and	 hypomagnesemia.	 These	
associations	suggest	that	a	variety	of	different	metabolic	products	may	
enhance	CPP	crystal	deposition	either	by	directly	altering	cartilage	or	
by	 inhibiting	 inorganic	 pyrophosphatases.	 Investigation	 of	 younger	
patients	 with	 CPPD	 should	 include	 inquiry	 for	 evidence	 of	 familial	
aggregation	 and	 evaluation	 of	 serum	 calcium,	 phosphorus,	 alkaline	
phosphatase,	magnesium,	iron,	and	transferrin.
 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Acute	CPP	crystal	arthritis,	originally	termed	pseudogout	by	McCarty	
and	co-workers,	often	mimics	acute	gout	flares	with	similar	articular	
findings	 of	 substantial	 inflammation.	 There	 are	 several	 clinical	 clues	
that	suggest	CPP	crystal	arthritis.	The	knee	is	the	joint	most	commonly	
affected,	followed	by	the	wrist,	while	the	first	metatarsophalangeal	joint	
(podagra)	is	rarely	affected.	Other	affected	joints	include	the	shoulder,	
ankle,	elbow,	and	hands.	Also,	initial	episodes	of	acute	attacks	tend	to	
last	longer	than	typical	gout	flares,	even	up	to	weeks	to	months.	Acute	
attacks	 present	 sometimes	 with	 systemic	 signs	 such	 as	 fever,	 chills,	
and	 elevated	 acute-phase	 reactants.	 Acute	 CPP	 crystal	 arthritis	 may	
be	precipitated	by	trauma,	severe	medical	illness,	or	surgery,	especially

2866 parathyroidectomy,	 as	 it	 leads	 to	 rapid	 diminution	 of	 serum	 calcium	
and	magnesium	levels,	causing	dissolution	and	shedding	of	crystal.

Chronic	 CPP	 crystal	 arthritis	 has	 several	 patterns;	 the	 most	 com-
mon	form	is	a	polyarticular	arthritis	resembling	osteoarthritis	(pseu-
doosteoarthritis).	 The	 clinical	 picture	 mimics	 that	 of	 progressive	
osteoarthritis,	 characterized	 by	 unusually	 severe	 joint	 damage	 in	
atypical	 joints	 for	 osteoarthritis,	 such	 as	 metacarpophalangeal,	 wrist,	
elbow,	 shoulder,	 or	 ankle	 joints.	 Other	 less	 common	 forms	 include	
chronic	 symmetric	 synovitis	 that	 is	 clinically	 similar	 to	 rheumatoid	
arthritis,	 severe	 destructive	 disease	 that	 may	 radiographically	 mimic	
neuropathic	 arthritis,	 intervertebral	 disk	 and	 ligament	 calcification	
with	restriction	of	spine	mobility,	the	crowned	dens	syndrome,	spinal	
stenosis	 (most	 commonly	 seen	 in	 the	 elderly),	 and	 rarely,	 tumoral	
deposits	of	CPP	crystals	in	soft	tissues.

If	 radiographs	 or	 ultrasound	 reveal	 punctate	 and/or	 linear	 radi-
odense	 deposits	 within	 fibrocartilaginous	 joint	 menisci	 or	 articular	
hyaline	cartilage	(chondrocalcinosis),	the	diagnostic	likelihood	of	CPPD	
disease	 is	 further	 increased.	 Definitive  diagnosis	 requires	 demonstra-
tion	of	typical	rhomboid	or	rodlike	crystals	(generally	weakly	positively	
birefringent	or	nonbirefringent	with	polarized	light)	in	synovial	fluid	
or	articular	tissue	(Fig.	372-2).	In	the	absence	of	joint	effusion	or	indi-
cations	to	obtain	a	synovial	biopsy,	chondrocalcinosis	is	presumptive	
of	 CPPD.	 One	 exception	 is	 chondrocalcinosis	 due	 to	 CaOx	 in	 some	
patients	with	chronic	renal	failure.

In	as	many	as	50%	of	cases,	episodes	of	CPP	crystal-induced	inflam-
mation	are	associated	with	low-grade	fever	and,	on	occasion,	tempera-
tures	as	high	as	40°C	(104°F).	In	such	cases,	synovial	fluid	analysis	with	
microbial	 cultures	 is	 essential	 to	 rule	 out	 the	 possibility	 of	 infection.	
In	fact,	infection	in	a	joint	with	any	microcrystalline	deposition	pro-
cess	can	lead	to	crystal	shedding	and	subsequent	synovitis	from	both	
crystals	and	microorganisms.	The	leukocyte	count	in	synovial	fluid	in	
acute	CPPD	can	range	from	several	thousand	cells	to	100,000	cells/μL,	
with	the	mean	being	~24,000	cells/μL	and	the	predominant	cell	being	
the	neutrophil.	CPP	crystals	may	be	seen	inside	tissue	fragments	and	
fibrin	clots	and	in	neutrophils	(Fig.	372-2).	CPP	crystals	may	coexist	
with	MSU	and	apatite	in	some	cases.

TREATMENT
CPPD Disease

Anti-inflammatory	 treatment	 for	 acute	 CPP	 crystal	 arthritis	 is	
largely	adapted	from	that	for	gout	flares,	including	ice	pack	appli-
cations	 with	 rest,	 joint	 fluid	 aspiration	 and	 glucocorticoid	 injec-
tion,	oral	colchicine,	NSAIDs,	and	systemic	glucocorticoids.	Severe	
polyarticular	attacks	can	also	be	treated	with	the	IL-1β	antagonist	
anakinra.	For	patients	with	frequent	recurrent	attacks,	prophylactic	
treatment	 with	 daily	 colchicine	 can	 be	 helpful.	 For	 chronic	 CPP	
crystal	 arthritis,	 there	 is	 no	 effective	 way	 to	 remove	 CPP	 crys-
tal	 deposits	 from	 cartilage	 and	 synovium	 (unlike	 urate-lowering	
agents	in	gout).	Limited	studies	suggest	that	NSAIDs	(with	a	gastric	
protective	agent	if	required),	colchicine,	low-dose	glucocorticoids,	
hydroxychloroquine,	 or	 methotrexate	 may	 be	 helpful	 for	 chronic	
synovitis.	Patients	with	progressive	destructive	large-joint	arthrop-
athy	may	require	joint	replacement.

CALCIUM APATITE DEPOSITION DISEASE
 ■ PATHOGENESIS
Apatite	 is	 the	 primary	 mineral	 of	 normal	 bone	 and	 teeth.	 Abnor-
mal	 accumulation	 of	 basic	 calcium	 phosphates,	 largely	 carbonate	
substituted	 apatite,	 can	 occur	 in	 areas	 of	 tissue	 damage	 (dystrophic	
calcification),	 hypercalcemic	 or	 hyperparathyroid	 states	 (metastatic	
calcification),	connective	tissue	diseases	(calcinosis),	and	other	condi-
tions	(Table 372-3).	In	chronic	renal	failure,	hyperphosphatemia	can	
contribute	 to	 extensive	 apatite	 deposition	 both	 in	 and	 around	 joints	
(tumoral	calcinosis,	calciphylaxis).	Familial	aggregation	is	rarely	seen.

crystals	 can	 undergo	 mitosis	 and	 markedly	 increase	 the	 release	 of	
prostaglandin	E2,	various	cytokines,	and	collagenases	and	neutral	pro-
teases,	underscoring	the	destructive	potential	of	abnormally	stimulated	
synovial	lining	cells.

Although	 the	 true	 incidence	 of	 apatite	 arthritis	 is	 not	 known,	
30–50%	 of	 patients	 with	 osteoarthritis	 have	 apatite	 microcrystals	 in	
their	synovial	fluid.	Such	crystals	frequently	can	be	identified	in	clin-
ically	stable	osteoarthritic	joints,	but	they	are	more	likely	to	come	to	
attention	in	persons	experiencing	acute	or	subacute	worsening	of	joint	
pain	and	swelling.

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Periarticular	 or	 articular	 deposits	 can	 present	 with	 acute	 reversible	
inflammation	 and/or	 chronic	 damage	 to	 the	 joint	 capsule,	 tendons,	
bursa,	or	articular	surfaces	(Table	372-3).	The	most	common	sites	of	
apatite	 deposition	 include	 bursae	 and	 tendons	 in	 and/or	 around	 the	
knees,	shoulders,	hips,	and	fingers.	These	deposits	can	also	be	asymp-
tomatic	radiographic	abnormalities.

Apatite	aggregates	are	often	present	in	synovial	fluid	in	an	extremely	
destructive	chronic	arthropathy	of	the	elderly	that	occurs	most	often	in	
the	shoulders	(Milwaukee	shoulder)	and	in	a	similar	process	in	hips,	
knees,	and	erosive	osteoarthritis	of	fingers	(Table	372-3).	Joint	destruc-
tion	is	associated	with	damage	to	cartilage	and	supporting	structures,	
leading	to	instability	and	deformity.	Progression	tends	to	be	indolent.	
Symptoms	range	from	minimal	to	severe	pain	and	disability	that	may	
lead	to	joint	replacement	surgery.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Intra-	and/or	periarticular	calcifications	with	or	without	erosive,	destruc-
tive,	 or	 hypertrophic	 changes	 may	 be	 seen	 on	 radiographs	 (Fig.  372-3).	
They	should	be	distinguished	from	the	linear	calcifications	typical	of	CPPD.
The	synovial	fluid	leukocyte	count	in	apatite	arthritis	is	usually	low	
(<2000/μL)	despite	dramatic	symptoms,	with	predominance	of	mono-
nuclear	 cells.	 Definitive	 diagnosis	 of	 apatite	 arthropathy,	 also	 called	
basic	calcium	phosphate	disease,	depends	on	identification	of	crystals	
from	synovial	fluid	or	tissue	(Fig.	372-3).	Individual	crystals	are	very	
small	and	can	be	seen	only	by	electron	microscopy.	Clumps	of	crystals	
may	appear	as	1-	to	20-μm	shiny	intra-	or	extracellular	nonbirefringent	
globules	or	aggregates	that	stain	purplish	with	Wright’s	stain	and	bright	
red	 with	 alizarin	 red	 S.	 Absolute	 identification	 depends	 on	 electron	
microscopy	 with	 energy-dispersive	 elemental	 analysis,	 x-ray	 diffrac-
tion,	 infrared	 spectroscopy,	 or	 Raman	 microspectroscopy,	 but	 these	
techniques	usually	are	not	required	in	clinical	diagnosis.

microscopy; 400×).

CaOx DEPOSITION DISEASE
 ■ PATHOGENESIS
In	chronic	renal	disease,	CaOx	deposits	have	long	been	recognized	in	
visceral	organs,	blood	vessels,	bones,	and	cartilage	and	are	now	known	
to	be	one	of	the	causes	of	arthritis	in	chronic	renal	failure.	Thus	far,	
reported	 patients	 have	 been	 dependent	 on	 long-term	 hemodialysis	
or	 peritoneal	 dialysis	 (Chap.  312),	 and	 many	 had	 received	 ascorbic	
acid	 supplements.	 Ascorbic	 acid	 is	 metabolized	 to	 oxalate,	 which	 is	
inadequately	cleared	in	uremia	and	by	dialysis.	Such	supplements	and	
foods	high	in	oxalate	content	usually	are	avoided	in	dialysis	programs	
because	of	the	risk	of	enhancing	hyperoxalosis	and	its	sequelae.

CaOx	aggregates	can	be	found	in	bone,	articular	cartilage,	synovium,	
and	periarticular	tissues.	From	these	sites,	crystals	may	be	shed,	causing	
acute	synovitis.	Persistent	aggregates	of	CaOx	can,	like	apatite	and	CPP	
crystals,	stimulate	synovial	cell	proliferation	and	enzyme	release,	resulting	
in	progressive	articular	destruction.	Primary oxalosis	is	a	rare	hereditary	
metabolic	disorder	(Chap. 420)	that	can	lead	to	acute	or	chronic	CaOx	
arthritis,	periarthritis,	and	bone	disease	during	later	years	of	illness.
 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS
Clinical	features	of	acute	CaOx	arthritis	may	not	be	distinguishable	from	
those	due	to	MSU,	CPP,	or	apatite.	Deposits	have	been	documented	in	
fingers,	wrists,	elbows,	knees,	ankles,	and	feet.	Radiographs	may	reveal	
chondrocalcinosis	or	soft	tissue	calcifications.	CaOx-induced	synovial	
effusions	 are	 usually	 noninflammatory,	 with	 <2000	 leukocytes/μL,	 or	
mildly	inflammatory.	Neutrophils	or	mononuclear	cells	can	predomi-
nate.	CaOx	crystals	have	a	variable	shape	and	variable	birefringence	to	
polarized	light.	The	most	easily	recognized	forms	are	bipyramidal,	have	
strong	birefringence	(Fig. 372-4),	and	stain	with	alizarin	red	S.

TREATMENT
Calcium Oxalate Deposition Disease

Treatment	of	CaOx	arthropathy	with	NSAIDs,	colchicine,	intraar-
ticular	 glucocorticoids,	 and/or	 an	 increased	 frequency	 of	 dialy-
sis	 has	 produced	 only	 slight	 improvement.	 In	 primary	 oxalosis,	
liver	transplantation	has	induced	a	significant	reduction	in	crystal	
deposits	(Chap. 420).

TREATMENT
Calcium Apatite Deposition Disease

Treatment	of	apatite	arthritis	or	periarthritis	is	nonspecific.	Acute	
attacks	 of	 bursitis	 or	 synovitis	 may	 be	 self-limiting,	 resolving	 in	
days	to	several	weeks.	Aspiration	of	effusions	and	the	use	of	either	
NSAIDs	 or	 oral	 colchicine	 for	 2	 weeks	 or	 intra-	 or	 periarticular	
injection	of	a	depot	glucocorticoid	appear	to	shorten	the	duration	
and	 intensity	 of	 symptoms.	 Periarticular	 apatite	 deposits	 may	 be	
resorbed	 with	 resolution	 of	 attacks.	 Agents	 to	 lower	 serum	 phos-
phate	 levels	 may	 lead	 to	 resorption	 of	 deposits	 in	 renal	 failure	
patients	receiving	hemodialysis.	In	patients	with	underlying	severe	
destructive	articular	changes,	response	to	medical	therapy	is	usually	
less	rewarding.

373 Fibromyalgia

Leslie J. Crofford

 ■ DEFINITION
Fibromyalgia	 (FM)	 is	 characterized	 by	 chronic	 widespread	 muscu-
loskeletal	 pain	 and	 tenderness.	 Although	 FM	 is	 defined	 primarily	 as	
a	 pain	 syndrome,	 patients	 also	 commonly	 report	 associated	 neurop-
sychological	 symptoms	 of	 fatigue,	 unrefreshing	 sleep,	 cognitive	 dys-
function,	anxiety,	and	depression.	Patients	with	FM	have	an	increased	
prevalence	 of	 other	 syndromes	 associated	 with	 pain	 and	 fatigue,	
including	myalgic	encephalitis/chronic	fatigue	syndrome	(Chap. 450),	
temporomandibular	disorder,	chronic	headaches,	irritable	bowel	syn-
drome,	interstitial	cystitis/painful	bladder	syndrome,	and	other	pelvic	
pain	 syndromes.	 Available	 evidence	 implicates	 the	 central	 nervous	
system	as	key	to	maintaining	pain	and	other	core	symptoms	of	FM	and	
related	conditions.	The	presence	of	FM	is	associated	with	substantial	
negative	consequences	for	physical	and	social	functioning.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Worldwide	prevalence	is	~2%,	with	a	prevalence	of	~4%	in	women	and	
<1%	 in	 men.	 There	 is	 some	 variability	 depending	 on	 the	 method	 of	
ascertainment;	however,	the	prevalence	data	are	similar	across	world	
regions	and	socioeconomic	classes.	Cultural	factors	may	play	a	role	in	
determining	whether	patients	with	FM	symptoms	seek	medical	atten-
tion;	however,	even	in	cultures	in	which	secondary	gain	is	not	expected	
to	play	a	significant	role,	the	prevalence	of	FM	remains	in	this	range.	In	
clinical	settings,	a	diagnosis	of	FM	is	far	more	common	in	women	than	
in	men,	with	a	ratio	of	~9:1.
 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Pain  and  Tenderness  At	 presentation,	 patients	 with	 FM	 most	
commonly	report	“pain	all	over.”	These	patients	have	pain	that	is	typ-
ically	both	above	and	below	the	waist	on	both	sides	of	the	body	and	
involves	the	axial	skeleton	(neck,	back,	or	chest).	The	pain	attributable	
to	FM	is	poorly	localized,	difficult	to	ignore,	severe	in	its	intensity,	and	
associated	with	a	reduced	functional	capacity.	For	a	diagnosis	of	FM,	

pain	should	have	been	present	most	of	the	day	on	most	days	for	at	least	
3	months.

The	pain	of	FM	is	associated	with	tenderness	and	increased	evoked	
pain	 sensitivity.	 In	 clinical	 practice,	 this	 elevated	 sensitivity	 may	 be	
identified	 by	 pain	 induced	 by	 the	 pressure	 of	 a	 blood	 pressure	 cuff	
or	 skin	 roll	 tenderness.	 More	 formally,	 an	 examiner	 may	 complete	 a	
tender-point	 examination	 in	 which	 the	 examiner	 uses	 the	 thumbnail	
to	 exert	 pressure	 of	 ~4	 kg/m2	 (or	 the	 amount	 of	 pressure	 leading	 to	
blanching	of	the	tip	of	the	thumbnail)	on	well-defined	musculotend-
inous	 sites	 (Fig.  373-1).	 Previously,	 the	 classification	 criteria	 of	 the	
American	 College	 of	 Rheumatology	 required	 that	 11	 of	 18	 sites	 be	
perceived	as	painful	for	a	diagnosis	of	FM.	In	practice,	tenderness	is	
a	continuous	variable,	and	strict	application	of	a	categorical	threshold	
for	 diagnostic	 specifics	 is	 not	 necessary.	 Newer	 criteria	 eliminate	 the	
need	 for	 identification	 of	 tender	 points	 and	 focus	 instead	 on	 clinical	
symptoms	 of	 widespread	 or	 multisite	 pain	 and	 neuropsychological	
symptoms.	 The	 newer	 criteria	 perform	 well	 in	 a	 clinical	 setting	 in	
comparison	 to	 the	 older,	 tender-point	 criteria.	 However,	 it	 appears	
that	 when	 the	 new	 criteria	 are	 applied	 to	 populations,	 the	 result	 is	
an	 increase	 in	 prevalence	 of	 FM	 and	 a	 change	 in	 the	 sex	 ratio	 (see		
“Epidemiology,”	earlier).

Patients	 with	 FM	 often	 have	 peripheral	 pain	 generators	 that	 are	
thought	 to	 serve	 as	 triggers	 for	 the	 more	 widespread	 pain	 attributed	
to	 central	 nervous	 system	 factors.	 Potential	 pain	 generators	 such	 as	
arthritis,	bursitis,	tendinitis,	neuropathies,	and	other	inflammatory	or	
degenerative	 conditions	 should	 be	 identified	 by	 history	 and	 physical	
examination.	More	subtle	pain	generators	may	include	joint	hypermo-
bility	 and	 scoliosis.	 In	 addition,	 patients	 may	 have	 chronic	 myalgias	
triggered	 by	 infectious,	 metabolic,	 or	 psychiatric	 conditions	 that	 can	
serve	as	triggers	for	the	development	of	FM.	These	conditions	are	often	
identified	in	the	differential	diagnosis	of	patients	with	FM,	and	a	major	
challenge	is	to	distinguish	the	ongoing	activity	of	a	triggering	condition	
from	FM	that	is	occurring	as	a	consequence	of	a	comorbid	condition	
and	that	should	itself	be	treated.

Neuropsychological Symptoms 
In	addition	to	widespread	pain,	
FM	 patients	 typically	 report	 fatigue,	 stiffness,	 sleep	 disturbance,	
cognitive	 dysfunction,	 anxiety,	 and	 depression.	 These	 symptoms	 are	
present	 to	 varying	 degrees	 in	 most	 FM	 patients	 but	 are	 not	 present	
in	 every	 patient	 or	 at	 all	 times	 in	 a	 given	 patient.	 Relative	 to	 pain,

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disorderssuch	 symptoms	 may,	 however,	 have	 an	 equal	 or	 even	 greater	 impact	
on	function	and	quality	of	life.	Fatigue	is	highly	prevalent	in	patients	
under	 primary	 care	 who	 ultimately	 are	 diagnosed	 with	 FM.	 Pain,	
stiffness,	and	fatigue	often	are	worsened	by	exercise	or	unaccustomed	
activity.	 The	 sleep	 complaints	 include	 difficulty	 falling	 asleep,	 diffi-
culty	staying	asleep,	and	early-morning	awakening.	Regardless	of	the	
specific	 complaint,	 patients	 awake	 feeling	 unrefreshed.	 Patients	 with	
FM	may	meet	criteria	for	restless	legs	syndrome	and	sleep-disordered	
breathing;	frank	sleep	apnea	can	also	be	documented.	Cognitive	issues	
are	characterized	as	difficulties	with	attention	or	concentration,	prob-
lems	 with	 word	 retrieval,	 and	 short-term	 memory	 loss.	 Studies	 have	
demonstrated	altered	cognitive	function	in	these	domains	in	patients	
with	FM,	although	speed	of	processing	is	age	appropriate.	Symptoms	
of	 anxiety	 and	 depression	 are	 common,	 and	 the	 lifetime	 prevalence	
of	 mood	 disorders	 in	 patients	 with	 FM	 approaches	 80%.	 Although	
depression	is	neither	necessary	nor	sufficient	for	the	diagnosis	of	FM,	
it	 is	 important	 to	 screen	 for	 major	 depressive	 disorders	 by	 querying	
for	 depressed	 mood	 and	 anhedonia.	 Analysis	 of	 genetic	 factors	 that	
are	likely	to	predispose	to	FM	reveals	shared	neurobiologic	pathways	
with	mood	disorders,	providing	the	basis	for	comorbidity	(see	later	in	
this	chapter).
Overlapping Syndromes  FM	is	considered	as	part	of	a	group	of	
conditions	called	“chronic	overlapping	pain	syndromes”	because	of	the	
propensity	to	coexist	with	other	syndromes	that	may	share	underlying	
mechanisms.	 Review	 of	 systems	 often	 reveals	 headaches,	 facial/jaw	
pain,	regional	myofascial	pain	particularly	involving	the	neck	or	back,	
and	arthritis.	Visceral	pain	involving	the	gastrointestinal	tract,	bladder,	
and	pelvic	or	perineal	region	is	often	present	as	well.	It	is	important	for	
patients	 to	 understand	 that	 shared	 pathways	 may	 mediate	 symptoms	
and	 treatment	 strategies	 effective	 for	 one	 condition	 may	 help	 with	
global	symptom	management.
Comorbid Conditions  FM	is	often	comorbid	with	chronic	mus-
culoskeletal,	infectious,	metabolic,	or	psychiatric	conditions.	Whereas	
FM	affects	only	~2%	of	the	general	population,	it	occurs	in	~10–30%	
of	 patients	 with	 degenerative	 or	 inflammatory	 rheumatic	 disorders,	
likely	because	these	conditions	serve	as	peripheral	pain	generators	to	
alter	 central	 pain-processing	 pathways.	 Similarly,	 chronic	 infectious,	
metabolic,	or	psychiatric	diseases	associated	with	musculoskeletal	pain	
can	mimic	FM	and/or	serve	as	a	trigger	for	the	development	of	FM.	
It	is	particularly	important	for	clinicians	to	be	sensitive	to	pain	man-
agement	 of	 these	 comorbid	 conditions	 so	 that	 when	 FM	 emerges—	
characterized	by	pain	outside	the	boundaries	of	what	could	reasonably	
be	explained	by	the	triggering	condition,	development	of	neuropsycho-
logical	symptoms,	or	tenderness	on	physical	examination—treatment	
of	central	pain	processes	will	be	undertaken	as	opposed	to	a	continued	
focus	on	treatment	of	peripheral	or	inflammatory	causes	of	pain.

Psychosocial Considerations  Symptoms	of	FM	often	have	their	
onset	 and	 are	 exacerbated	 during	 periods	 of	 perceived	 stress.	 This	
pattern	 may	 reflect	 an	 interaction	 among	 central	 stress	 physiology,	
vigilance	or	anxiety,	and	central	pain-processing	pathways.	An	under-
standing	of	current	psychosocial	stressors	will	aid	in	patient	manage-
ment,	as	many	factors	that	exacerbate	symptoms	cannot	be	addressed	
by	pharmacologic	approaches.	Furthermore,	there	is	a	high	prevalence	
of	 exposure	 to	 previous	 interpersonal	 and	 other	 forms	 of	 violence	
in	 patients	 with	 FM	 and	 related	 conditions.	 If	 posttraumatic	 stress	
disorder	 is	 an	 issue,	 the	 clinician	 should	 be	 aware	 of	 it	 and	 consider	
treatment	options.

Functional Impairment 
It	is	crucial	to	evaluate	the	impact	of	FM	
symptoms	on	function	and	role	fulfillment.	In	defining	the	success	of	a	
management	strategy,	improved	function	is	a	key	measure.	Functional	
assessment	should	include	physical,	mental,	and	social	domains.	Rec-
ognition	of	the	ways	in	which	role	functioning	falls	short	will	be	helpful	
in	establishing	treatment	goals.
 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Because	 musculoskeletal	 pain	 is	 such	 a	 common	 complaint,	 the	 dif-
ferential	diagnosis	of	FM	is	broad.	Table 373-1	lists	some	of	the	more

common	conditions	that	should	be	considered.	Patients	with	inflam-

of	 specific	 history,	 physical	 findings,	 and	 laboratory	 or	 radiographic	
tests.
 ■ LABORATORY OR RADIOGRAPHIC TESTING
Routine	laboratory	and	radiographic	tests	yield	normal	results	in	FM	
without	 comorbidities.	 Thus,	 diagnostic	 testing	 is	 focused	 on	 iden-
tification	 of	 other	 diagnoses	 and	 evaluation	 for	 pain	 generators	 or	
comorbid	 conditions	 (Table  373-2).	 Most	 patients	 with	 new	 chronic	
widespread	pain	should	be	assessed	for	the	most	common	entities	in	
the	 differential	 diagnosis.	 Radiographic	 testing	 should	 be	 used	 very	
sparingly	 and	 only	 for	 diagnosis	 of	 inflammatory	 arthritis.	 After	 the	
patient	 has	 been	 evaluated	 thoroughly,	 repeat	 testing	 is	 discouraged	
unless	the	symptom	complex	changes.	Particularly	to	be	discouraged	
is	magnetic	resonance	imaging	(MRI)	of	the	spine	unless	there	are	fea-
tures	suggesting	inflammatory	spine	disease	or	neurologic	symptoms.

 ■ GENETICS AND PHYSIOLOGY

As	in	most	complex	diseases,	it	is	likely	that	a	number	of	genes	
contribute	 to	 vulnerability	 to	 the	 development	 of	 FM.	 To	 date,	
these	genes	appear	to	be	in	pathways	controlling	pain	and	stress	
responses.	Some	of	the	genetic	underpinnings	of	FM	are	shared	across	
other	 chronic	 pain	 conditions.	 Genes	 associated	 with	 metabolism,	
transport,	and	receptors	of	serotonin	and	other	monoamines	have	been	
implicated	 in	 FM	 and	 overlapping	 conditions.	 Genes	 associated	 with	
other	pathways	involved	in	pain	transmission	have	also	been	described	
as	vulnerability	factors	for	FM.	Taken	together,	the	pathways	in	which	
polymorphisms	have	been	identified	in	FM	patients	further	implicate	
central	factors	in	mediation	of	the	physiology	that	leads	to	the	clinical	
manifestations	of	FM.

Psychophysical	testing	of	patients	with	FM	has	demonstrated	altered	
sensory	 afferent	 pain	 processing	 and	 impaired	 descending	 noxious	
inhibitory	 control	 leading	 to	 hyperalgesia	 and	 allodynia.	 Functional	
MRI	 and	 other	 research	 imaging	 procedures	 clearly	 demonstrate	
activation	 of	 the	 brain	 regions	 involved	 in	 the	 experience	 of	 pain	 in	
response	 to	 stimuli	 that	 are	 innocuous	 in	 study	 participants	 without	
FM.	 Pain	 perception	 in	 FM	 patients	 is	 influenced	 by	 the	 emotional	
and	cognitive	dimensions,	such	as	catastrophizing	and	perceptions	of	
control,	providing	a	solid	basis	for	recommendations	for	cognitive	and	
behavioral	treatment	strategies.

Studies	 have	 indicated	 that	 some	 patients	 meeting	 criteria	 for	 FM	
may	have	a	small	fiber	neuropathy.	Other	studies	have	identified	altera-
tions	 in	 expressed	 gene	 or	 metabolic	 signatures	 in	 peripheral	 blood.	
These	 early	 studies	 raise	 the	 possibility	 that	 confirmatory	 diagnostic	
testing	could	be	developed	in	the	future	to	assist	in	the	diagnosis	of	FM.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Fibromyalgia

FM	 is	 common	 and	 has	 an	 extraordinary	 impact	 on	 the	 patient’s	
function	 and	 health-related	 quality	 of	 life.	 Optimal	 management	
requires	 prompt	 diagnosis	 and	 assessment	 of	 pain,	 function,	 and	
psychosocial	 context.	 Physicians	 and	 other	 health	 professionals	
can	be	helpful	in	managing	some	of	the	symptoms	and	impact	of	
FM.	Developing	a	partnership	with	patients	is	essential	for	improv-
ing	 the	 outcome	 of	 FM,	 with	 a	 goal	 of	 understanding	 the	 factors	
involved,	implementing	a	treatment	strategy,	and	choosing	appro-
priate	nonpharmacologic	and	pharmacologic	treatments.

TREATMENT
Fibromyalgia	

NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT
Patients	 with	 chronic	 pain,	 fatigue,	 and	 other	 neuropsychological	
symptoms	 require	 a	 framework	 for	 understanding	 the	 symptoms	
that	have	such	an	important	impact	on	their	function	and	quality	
of	 life.	 Explaining	 the	 genetics,	 triggers,	 and	 physiology	 of	 FM	
can	 be	 an	 important	 adjunct	 in	 relieving	 associated	 anxiety	 and	
in	 reducing	 the	 overall	 cost	 of	 health	 care	 resources.	 In	 addition,	
patients	 must	 be	 educated	 regarding	 expectations	 for	 treatment.	
The	physician	should	focus	on	improved	function	and	quality	of	life	
rather	than	elimination	of	pain.	Illness	behaviors,	such	as	frequent	
physician	visits,	should	be	discouraged	and	behaviors	that	focus	on	
improved	function	strongly	encouraged.

Treatment	strategies	should	include	physical	conditioning,	with	
encouragement	 to	 begin	 at	 low	 levels	 of	 aerobic	 exercise	 and	 to	
proceed	 with	 slow	 but	 consistent	 advancement.	 Physical	 activity	
and	exercise	are	consistently	found	to	be	the	most	helpful	strategies.

Patients	 who	 have	 been	 physically	 inactive	 may	 do	 best	 in	 super-
vised	or	water-based	programs	at	the	start.	Strength	training	may	be	
recommended	after	patients	reach	their	aerobic	goals.	Transcutane-
ous	 electric	 nerve	 stimulation	 (TENS)	 reduces	 movement-evoked	
pain	and	fatigue.	Meditative	movement	therapies,	such	as	qigong,	
yoga,	 or	 Tai	 Chi,	 may	 also	 be	 helpful.	 Other	 defined	 physical	
therapies	 such	 as	 acupuncture	 or	 hydrotherapy	 may	 also	 be	 con-
sidered.	Exercise	programs	are	helpful	in	reducing	tenderness	and	
enhancing	self-efficacy.	Cognitive-behavioral	strategies	to	improve	
sleep	 hygiene	 and	 reduce	 illness	 behaviors	 can	 also	 be	 helpful	 in	
management.	

PHARMACOLOGIC APPROACHES
It	 is	 essential	 for	 the	 clinician	 to	 treat	 any	 comorbid	 triggering	
condition	 and	 to	 clearly	 delineate	 for	 the	 patient	 the	 treatment	
goals	 for	 each	 medication.	 For	 example,	 glucocorticoids	 or	 non-
steroidal	anti-inflammatory	drugs	may	be	useful	for	management	
of	 inflammatory	 triggers	 but	 are	 not	 effective	 against	 FM-related	
symptoms.	At	present,	the	treatment	approaches	that	have	proved	
most	successful	in	FM	patients	target	afferent	or	descending	pain	
pathways.	Table 373-3	lists	the	drugs	with	demonstrated	effective-
ness.	It	should	be	emphasized	that	strong	opioid	analgesics	are	to	be	
avoided	in	patients	with	FM.	These	agents	have	no	demonstrated	
efficacy	 in	 FM	 and	 are	 associated	 with	 adverse	 effects	 that	 can	
worsen	 both	 symptoms	 and	 function.	 Tramadol,	 an	 opioid	 with	
mild	serotonin-noradrenaline	reuptake	inhibitor	activity,	has	been	
studied	in	this	population	with	indication	of	efficacy.	Use	of	single	
agents	to	treat	multiple	symptom	domains	is	strongly	encouraged.	
For	example,	if	a	patient’s	symptom	complex	is	dominated	by	pain	
and	sleep	disturbance,	use	of	an	agent	that	exerts	both	analgesic	and	
sleep-promoting	effects	is	desirable.	These	agents	include	cycloben-
zaprine,	sedating	antidepressants	such	as	amitriptyline,	and	alpha-
2-delta	 ligands	 such	 as	 gabapentin	 and	 pregabalin.	 For	 patients	
whose	pain	is	associated	with	fatigue,	anxiety,	or	depression,	drugs	
that	have	both	analgesic	and	antidepressant/anxiolytic	effects,	such	
as	duloxetine	or	milnacipran,	may	be	the	best	first	choice.

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic Disorders374 Arthritis Associated  
with Systemic Disease,  
and Other Arthritides
Carol A. Langford, Brian F. Mandell

ARTHRITIS ASSOCIATED  
WITH SYSTEMIC DISEASE
 ■ ARTHROPATHY OF ACROMEGALY
Acromegaly	is	the	result	of	excessive	production	of	growth	hormone	
by	an	adenoma	in	the	anterior	pituitary	gland	(Chap. 383).	The	excess	
of	growth	hormone	along	with	insulin-like	growth	factor	I	stimulates	
proliferation	 of	 cartilage,	 periarticular	 connective	 tissue,	 and	 bone,	
resulting	in	several	musculoskeletal	problems,	including	osteoarthritis,	
back	pain,	muscle	weakness,	and	carpal	tunnel	syndrome.

Osteoarthritis	is	a	common	feature,	most	often	affecting	the	knees,	
shoulders,	hips,	and	hands.	Single	or	multiple	joints	may	be	affected.	
Hypertrophy	 of	 cartilage	 initially	 produces	 radiographic	 widening	 of	
the	 joint	 space.	 The	 newly	 synthesized	 cartilage	 is	 abnormally	 sus-
ceptible	to	fissuring,	ulceration,	and	destruction.	Ligamental	laxity	of	
joints	 further	 contributes	 to	 the	 development	 of	 articular	 discomfort	
and	 osteoarthritis.	 Cartilage	 degrades,	 the	 joint	 space	 narrows,	 and	
subchondral	sclerosis	and	osteophytes	may	develop.	Joint	examination	
reveals	 crepitus	 and	 laxity.	 Joint	 fluid	 is	 noninflammatory.	 Calcium	
pyrophosphate	 dihydrate	 crystals	 are	 found	 in	 the	 cartilage	 in	 some	
cases	 of	 acromegaly	 arthropathy	 and,	 when	 shed	 into	 the	 joint,	 can	
elicit	 attacks	 of	 pseudogout	 (calcium	 pyrophosphate	 arthropathy).	
Chondrocalcinosis	 may	 be	 observed	 on	 radiographs.	 Back	 pain	 is	
extremely	common,	perhaps	as	a	result	of	spine	hypermobility.	Spine	
radiographs	 show	 normal	 or	 widened	 intervertebral	 disk	 spaces,	
hypertrophic	 anterior	 osteophytes,	 and	 ligamental	 calcification.	 The	
latter	 changes	 are	 similar	 to	 those	 observed	 in	 patients	 with	 diffuse	
idiopathic	skeletal	hyperostosis.	Dorsal	kyphosis	in	conjunction	with	
elongation	of	the	ribs	contributes	to	the	development	of	the	barrel	chest	
seen	in	acromegalic	patients.	The	hands	and	feet	become	enlarged	as	
a	result	of	soft	tissue	proliferation.	The	fingers	are	thickened	and	have	
spadelike	distal	tufts.	One-third	of	patients	have	a	thickened	heel	pad.	
Approximately	25%	of	patients	exhibit	Raynaud’s	phenomenon.	Carpal	
tunnel	syndrome	occurs	in	about	half	of	patients.	The	median	nerve	
may	become	compressed	by	excess	connective	tissue	in	the	carpal	tun-
nel.	Patients	with	acromegaly	may	develop	proximal	muscle	weakness,	
which	 is	 thought	 to	 be	 caused	 by	 the	 effect	 of	 growth	 hormone	 on	
muscle.	Serum	muscle	enzyme	levels	and	electromyographic	findings	
are	normal.	Muscle	biopsy	specimens	contain	muscle	fibers	of	varying	
size	without	inflammation.
 ■ ARTHROPATHY OF HEMOCHROMATOSIS
Hemochromatosis	is	a	disorder	of	iron	storage.	Absorption	of	excessive	
amounts	of	iron	from	the	intestine	leads	to	iron	deposition	in	parenchy-
mal	cells,	which	results	in	impairment	of	organ	function	(Chap. 414).	
Symptoms	of	hemochromatosis	usually	begin	between	the	ages	of	40	
and	60	but	can	appear	earlier.	Arthropathy,	which	occurs	in	20–40%	of	
patients,	usually	begins	after	the	age	of	50	and	may	be	the	first	clinical	
feature	of	hemochromatosis.	The	arthropathy	is	an	osteoarthritis-like	
disorder	 affecting	 the	 small	 joints	 of	 the	 hands	 and	 later	 the	 larger	
joints,	such	as	knees,	ankles,	shoulders,	and	hips.	The	second	and	third	
metacarpophalangeal	joints	of	both	hands	are	often	the	first	and	most	
prominent	joints	affected;	this	clinical	picture	may	provide	an	impor-
tant	clue	to	the	possibility	of	hemochromatosis	because	these	joints	are	
not	predominantly	affected	by	primary	osteoarthritis.	Patients	experi-
ence	some	morning	stiffness	and	pain	with	use	of	involved	joints.	The	
affected	joints	are	enlarged	and	mildly	tender.	Hand	pain	in	patients	
with	 hemochromatosis	 generally	 is	 milder,	 starts	 at	 an	 earlier	 age,	
and	causes	less	disability	than	in	patients	with	primary	osteoarthritis.	

Radiographs	show	narrowing	of	the	joint	space,	subchondral	sclerosis,	
subchondral	 cysts,	 and	 juxtaarticular	 proliferation	 of	 bone.	 Hook-
like	osteophytes	are	seen	in	up	to	20%	of	patients;	although	they	are	
regarded	as	a	characteristic	feature	of	hemochromatosis,	they	are	not	
disease	specific.	However,	dominant	radiographic	and	clinical	findings	
in	 the	 second	 and	 third	 metacarpophalangeal	 joints,	 even	 if	 modest	
in	 degree,	 warrants	 evaluation	 of	 ferritin	 and	 iron/total	 iron-binding	
capacity	levels.	The	more	typical	radiographic	changes	of	primary	oste-
oarthritis	in	the	proximal	interphalangeal,	distal	interphalangeal,	and	
first	carpometacarpal	joint	are	often	not	present.	The	synovial	fluid	is	
noninflammatory.	The	synovium	shows	mild	to	moderate	proliferation	
of	 iron-containing	 lining	 cells,	 fibrosis,	 and	 some	 mononuclear	 cell	
infiltration.	In	approximately	half	of	patients,	there	is	evidence	of	cal-
cium	pyrophosphate	deposition	disease,	and	some	patients	late	in	the	
course	of	disease	experience	episodes	of	acute	calcium	pyrophosphate	
arthritis	(Chap. 372).	An	early	diagnosis	is	suggested	by	high	serum	
transferrin	saturation,	which	is	more	sensitive	than	ferritin	elevation.
Iron	 may	 damage	 the	 articular	 cartilage	 in	 several	 ways.	 Iron	 cat-
alyzes	 superoxide-dependent	 lipid	 peroxidation,	 which	 may	 play	 a	
role	in	joint	damage.	In	animal	models,	ferric	iron	has	been	shown	to	
interfere	with	collagen	formation	and	increase	the	release	of	lysosomal	
enzymes	from	cells	in	the	synovial	membrane.	Iron	inhibits	synovial	
tissue	 pyrophosphatase	 in	 vitro	 and	 therefore	 may	 inhibit	 pyrophos-
phatase	in	vivo,	resulting	in	chondrocalcinosis.

TREATMENT
Arthropathy of Hemochromatosis

tunately,	 this	 treatment	 has	 little	 effect	 on	 established	 arthritis,	
which,	 along	 with	 chondrocalcinosis,	 may	 progress.	 Symptom-	
based	treatment	of	the	arthritis	consists	of	administration	of	acet-
aminophen	 and	 nonsteroidal	 anti-inflammatory	 drugs	 (NSAIDs),

corticoids.	 Low-dose	 colchicine	 may	 have	 efficacy	 in	 limiting	 the

successful	in	advanced	disease.

 ■ HEMOPHILIC ARTHROPATHY
Hemophilia	is	a	sex-linked	recessive	genetic	disorder	characterized	by	
the	absence	or	deficiency	of	factor	VIII	(hemophilia	A,	or	classic	hemo-
philia)	or	factor	IX	(hemophilia	B,	or	Christmas	disease)	(Chap. 116).	
Hemophilia	A	constitutes	85%	of	cases.	Spontaneous	hemarthrosis	is	
a	common	problem	with	both	types	of	hemophilia	and	can	lead	to	a	
deforming	 arthritis.	 The	 frequency	 and	 severity	 of	 hemarthrosis	 are	
related	to	the	degree	of	clotting	factor	deficiency.	Hemarthrosis	is	not	
common	 in	 other	 disorders	 of	 coagulation	 such	 as	 von	 Willebrand	
disease,	factor	V	deficiency,	warfarin	therapy,	or	thrombocytopenia.

Hemarthrosis	occurs	after	1	year	of	age,	when	a	child	begins	to	walk	
and	run.	In	order	of	frequency,	the	joints	most	commonly	affected	are	
the	knees,	ankles,	elbows,	shoulders,	and	hips.	Small	joints	of	the	hands	
and	feet	are	occasionally	involved.

In	the	initial	stage	of	arthropathy,	hemarthrosis	produces	a	warm,	
tensely	swollen,	and	painful	joint.	The	patient	holds	the	affected	joint	
in	flexion	and	guards	against	any	movement.	Blood	in	the	joint	remains	
liquid	 because	 of	 the	 absence	 of	 intrinsic	 clotting	 factors	 and	 the	
absence	of	tissue	thromboplastin	in	the	synovium.	The	synovial	blood	
is	resorbed	over	a	period	of	≥1	week,	with	the	precise	interval	depend-
ing	on	the	size	of	the	hemarthrosis.	Joint	function	usually	returns	to	
normal	 or	 baseline	 in	 ~2	 weeks.	 Low-grade	 temperature	 elevation	
may	 accompany	 hemarthrosis,	 but	 a	 fever	 >38.3°C	 (101°F)	 warrants	
concern	about	infection.

Recurrent	 hemarthrosis	 may	 result	 in	 chronic,	 noninflammatory,	
fibrotic	 arthropathy.	 The	 involved	 joints	 remain	 swollen,	 and	 flexion	
deformities	 impacting	 function	 develop.	 Restricted	 joint	 motion	 or	
laxity	with	subluxation	is	a	feature	of	end-stage	disease.

Bleeding	 into	 muscle	 and	 soft	 tissue	 also	 causes	 musculoskeletal	
dysfunction.	When	bleeding	into	the	iliopsoas	muscle	occurs,	the	hip	
is	held	in	flexion	because	of	the	pain,	resulting	in	a	hip	flexion	contrac-
ture.	Rotation	of	the	hip	is	preserved,	which	distinguishes	this	problem	
from	hemarthrosis	or	other	causes	of	hip	synovitis.	Expansion	of	the	
hematoma	may	place	pressure	on	the	femoral	nerve,	resulting	in	femo-
ral	neuropathy.	Hemorrhage	into	a	closed	compartment	space,	such	as	
the	calf	or	the	volar	compartment	in	the	forearm,	can	result	in	muscle	
necrosis,	 neuropathy,	 and	 flexion	 deformities	 of	 the	 ankles,	 wrists,	
and	 fingers.	 When	 bleeding	 involves	 periosteum	 or	 bone,	 a	 painful	
pseudotumor	 forms.	 These	 pseudotumors	 occur	 distal	 to	 the	 elbows	
or	knees	in	children	and	improve	with	treatment	of	hemophilia.	Sur-
gical	removal	is	indicated	if	the	pseudotumor	continues	to	enlarge.	In	
adults,	pseudotumors	develop	in	the	femur	and	pelvis	and	are	usually	
refractory	 to	 treatment.	 When	 bleeding	 occurs	 in	 muscle,	 cysts	 may	
develop	 within	 the	 muscle.	 Needle	 aspiration	 of	 a	 cyst	 is	 contraindi-
cated	 because	 this	 procedure	 can	 induce	 further	 bleeding;	 however,	
if	 the	 cyst	 becomes	 secondarily	 infected,	 drainage	 may	 be	 necessary	
(after	factor	repletion).

Septic	 arthritis	 is	 rare	 in	 hemophilia	 but	 is	 difficult	 to	 distinguish	
from	 acute	 hemarthrosis	 on	 physical	 examination.	 If	 there	 is	 serious	
suspicion	 of	 an	 infected	 joint,	 the	 joint	 should	 be	 aspirated	 imme-
diately,	 the	 fluid	 cultured,	 and	 treatment	 with	 broad-spectrum	 anti-
biotics	 administered,	 with	 coverage	 for	 microorganisms	 including	
Staphylococcus,	 until	 culture	 results	 become	 available.	 Clotting	 factor	
deficiency	should	be	corrected	before	arthrocentesis	to	minimize	the	
risk	of	traumatic	bleeding.	Notably,	low-grade	fever	can	occur	in	the	
setting	of	acute	hemarthrosis.

Radiographs	 of	 joints	 reflect	 the	 stage	 of	 disease.	 In	 early	 stages,	
there	 is	 capsule	 distention;	 later,	 juxtaarticular	 osteopenia,	 marginal	
erosions,	and	subchondral	cysts	develop.	Late	in	the	disease,	the	joint	
space	 is	 narrowed,	 and	 there	 is	 bony	 overgrowth	 similar	 to	 that	 in	
osteoarthritis.

TREATMENT
Hemarthrosis

The	 treatment	 of	 musculoskeletal	 bleeding	 is	 initiated	 with	 the	
immediate	infusion	of	factor	VIII	or	IX	at	the	first	sign	of	joint	or	
muscle	hemorrhage.	Patients	who	have	developed	factor	inhibitors	
are	at	elevated	risk	for	joint	damage	and	may	benefit	from	receiving	
recombinant	 activated	 factor	 VII	 or	 activated	 prothrombin	 com-
plex	concentrate.	The	joint	should	be	rested	in	a	position	of	forced	
extension,	 as	 tolerated,	 to	 avoid	 contracture.	 Analgesia	 should	
be	 provided;	 nonselective	 NSAIDs,	 which	 can	 diminish	 platelet	
function,	should	be	avoided.	Selective	cyclooxygenase-2	inhibitors	
do	 not	 interfere	 with	 platelet	 function,	 although	 cardiovascular	
and	 gastrointestinal	 risks	 must	 still	 be	 weighed.	 Synovectomy—
open	or	arthroscopic—may	be	attempted	in	patients	with	chronic	
symptomatic	 synovial	 proliferation	 and	 recurrent	 hemarthrosis,	
although	hypertrophied	synovium	is	highly	vascular	and	subject	to	
bleeding.	Both	types	of	synovectomy	reduce	the	number	of	hemar-
throses.	 Open	 surgical	 synovectomy,	 however,	 is	 associated	 with	
some	loss	of	range	of	motion.	Both	require	aggressive	prophylaxis	
against	bleeding.	Radiosynovectomy	with	either	yttrium-90	silicate	
or	phosphorus-31	colloid	has	been	effective	and	may	be	attempted	
when	surgical	synovectomy	is	not	practical.	Total	joint	replacement	
is	indicated	for	severe	joint	destruction	and	incapacitating	pain.

 ■ ARTHROPATHIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES
Sickle  Cell  Disease  Sickle	 cell	 disease	 (Chap.  98)	 is	 associated	
with	 several	 musculoskeletal	 abnormalities	 (Table  374-1).	 Children	
aged	 <5	 years	 may	 develop	 diffuse	 swelling,	 tenderness,	 and	 warmth	
of	the	hands	and	feet	lasting	1–3	weeks.	This	condition,	referred	to	as	
sickle  cell  dactylitis	 or	 hand-foot  syndrome,	 has	 also	 been	 observed	 in	
sickle	 cell	 thalassemia.	 Dactylitis	 is	 believed	 to	 result	 from	 infarction

Infarction of bone marrow

of	 the	 bone	 marrow	 and	 cortical	 bone	 leading	 to	 periostitis	 and	 soft	
tissue	 swelling.	 Radiographs	 show	 periosteal	 elevation,	 subperiosteal	
new	bone	formation,	and	areas	of	radiolucency	and	increased	density	
involving	the	metacarpals,	metatarsals,	and	proximal	phalanges.	These	
bone	changes	disappear	after	several	months.	The	syndrome	leaves	little	
or	no	residual	damage.	Because	hematopoiesis	ceases	in	the	small	bones	
of	the	hands	and	feet	with	age,	the	syndrome	is	rarely	seen	after	age	5.
Sickle	cell	crisis	is	associated	with	periarticular	pain	and	occasion-
ally	with	joint	effusions.	The	joint	and	periarticular	area	are	warm	and	
tender.	Knees	and	elbows	are	most	often	affected,	but	other	joints	can	
be	involved.	Joint	effusions	are	usually	noninflammatory.	Acute	syno-
vial	infarction	can	cause	a	sterile	effusion	with	high	neutrophil	counts	
in	synovial	fluid.	Synovial	biopsies	have	shown	mild	lining-cell	prolif-
eration	and	microvascular	thrombosis	with	infarctions.	Scintigraphic	
studies	have	shown	decreased	marrow	uptake	adjacent	to	the	involved	
joint.	The	treatment	for	sickle	cell	crisis	is	detailed	in	Chap. 98.

Patients	 with	 sickle	 cell	 disease	 are	 predisposed	 to	 osteomyelitis,	
which	 commonly	 involves	 the	 long	 tubular	 bones	 (Chap.  131);	 Sal-
monella	is	a	particularly	common	cause	(Chap. 165).	Radiographs	of	
the	 involved	 site	 initially	 show	 periosteal	 elevation,	 with	 subsequent	
disruption	of	the	cortex.	Treatment	of	the	infection	results	in	healing	
of	the	bone	lesion.	In	addition,	bone	infarction	resulting	from	vasooc-
clusion	secondary	to	the	sickling	of	red	cells	can	occur	and	is	the	cause	
of	 the	 bone	 pain	 in	 sickle	 cell	 crisis.	 Bone	 infarction	 also	 occurs	 in	
hemoglobin	sickle	cell	disease	and	sickle	cell	thalassemia	(Chap. 98).	
In	 children,	 infarction	 of	 the	 epiphyseal	 growth	 plate	 interferes	 with	
normal	growth	of	the	affected	extremity.	Radiographically,	infarction	
of	the	bone	cortex	results	in	periosteal	elevation	and	irregular	thick-
ening	of	the	bone	cortex.	Infarction	in	the	bone	marrow	leads	to	lysis,	
fibrosis,	and	new	bone	formation.	Clinical	distinction	between	osteo-
myelitis	and	bone	infarctions	can	be	difficult;	imaging	can	be	helpful.

Avascular	 necrosis	 of	 the	 head	 of	 the	 femur	 occurs	 in	 ~5%	 of	
patients.	It	also	occurs	in	the	humeral	head	and	less	commonly	in	the	
distal	femur,	tibial	condyles,	distal	radius,	vertebral	bodies,	and	other	
juxtaarticular	 sites.	 Irregularity	 of	 the	 femoral	 head	 and	 other	 artic-
ular	 surfaces	 often	 results	 in	 degenerative	 joint	 disease.	 Radiographs	
may	 show	 patchy	 radiolucency	 and	 density	 followed	 by	 flattening	 of	
the	 bone.	 MRI	 is	 a	 sensitive	 technique	 for	 detecting	 early	 avascular	
necrosis	 as	 well	 as	 bone	 infarction	 elsewhere.	 Total	 hip	 replacement	
and	placement	of	prostheses	in	other	joints	may	improve	function	and	
relieve	joint	pain	in	these	patients.

Septic	 arthritis	 is	 occasionally	 encountered	 in	 sickle	 cell	 disease	
(Chap. 130).	Multiple	joints	may	be	infected.	Joint	infection	may	result	
from	bacteremia	due	to	splenic	dysfunction	or	from	contiguous	oste-
omyelitis.	The	more	common	microorganisms	include	Staphylococcus 
aureus,	Streptococcus,	and	Salmonella.	Salmonella	does	not	cause	septic	
arthritis	as	frequently	as	it	causes	osteomyelitis.	Acute	gouty	arthritis	is	
uncommon	in	sickle	cell	disease,	even	though	40%	of	patients	are	hype-
ruricemic.	 However,	 it	 may	 occur	 in	 patients	 generally	 not	 expected	
to	get	gout	(young	patients,	female	patients).	Hyperuricemia	is	due	to	
overproduction	of	uric	acid	secondary	to	increased	red	cell	turnover	as	
well	as	suboptimal	renal	excretion.	Attacks	may	be	polyarticular,	and	
diagnostic	arthrocentesis	should	be	performed	to	distinguish	infection	
from	gout	or	synovial	infarction.

The	bone	marrow	hyperplasia	in	sickle	cell	disease	results	in	widen-
ing	of	the	medullary	cavities,	thinning	of	the	cortices,	and	coarse	tra-
beculations	and	central	cupping	of	the	vertebral	bodies.	These	changes	
are	also	seen	to	a	lesser	degree	in	hemoglobin	sickle	cell	disease	and	
sickle	 cell	 thalassemia.	 In	 normal	 individuals,	 red	 marrow	 is	 located

mostly	 in	 the	 axial	 skeleton,	 but	 in	 sickle	 cell	 disease,	 red	 marrow	 is	
found	in	the	bones	of	the	extremities	and	even	in	the	tarsal	and	carpal	
bones.	 Vertebral	 compression	 may	 lead	 to	 dorsal	 kyphosis,	 and	 soft-
ening	of	the	bone	in	the	acetabulum	may	result	in	protrusio	acetabuli.

Thalassemia  A	 congenital	 disorder	 of	 hemoglobin	 synthesis,		
β	 thalassemia	 is	 characterized	 by	 impaired	 production	 of	 β	 chains	
(Chap.  98).	 Bone	 and	 joint	 abnormalities	 occur	 in	 β	 thalassemia,	
being	most	common	in	the	major	and	intermedia	groups.	In	one	study,	
~50%	of	patients	with	β	thalassemia	had	evidence	of	symmetric	ankle	
arthropathy	with	onset	in	the	second	or	third	decade	of	life.	The	degree	
of	 ankle	 pain	 in	 these	 patients	 varied.	 Some	 patients	 experienced	
self-limited	 ankle	 pain	 that	 occurred	 only	 after	 strenuous	 physical	
activity	 and	 lasted	 several	 days	 or	 weeks,	 while	 others	 had	 chronic	
ankle	pain	that	became	worse	with	walking.	Compression	of	the	ankle,	
calcaneus,	or	forefoot	was	painful	in	some	patients.	Synovial	fluid	from	
two	patients	was	noninflammatory.	Radiographs	of	the	ankle	showed	
osteopenia,	 widened	 medullary	 spaces,	 thin	 cortices,	 and	 coarse	 tra-
beculations	as	a	result	of	bone	marrow	expansion.	The	joint	space	was	
preserved.	Specimens	of	bone	from	three	patients	revealed	osteomala-
cia,	osteopenia,	and	microfractures.	Increased	numbers	of	osteoblasts	
as	well	as	increased	foci	of	bone	resorption	were	present	on	the	bone	
surface.	Iron	staining	was	found	in	the	bone	trabeculae,	in	osteoid,	and	
in	the	cement	line.	Synovium	showed	hyperplasia	of	lining	cells,	which	
contained	deposits	of	hemosiderin.	This	arthropathy	was	considered	to	
be	related	to	the	underlying	bone	pathology.	The	role	of	iron	overload	
or	abnormal	bone	metabolism	in	the	pathogenesis	of	this	arthropathy	
is	not	known.	The	arthropathy	was	treated	with	analgesics	and	splints.	
Patients	also	received	transfusions	to	decrease	hematopoiesis	and	bone	
marrow	expansion.

In	patients	with	β-thalassemia	major	and	β-thalassemia	intermedia,	
other	joints	are	also	involved,	including	the	knees,	hips,	and	shoulders.	
Acquired	hemochromatosis	with	arthropathy	has	been	described	in	a	
patient	with	thalassemia.	Gouty	arthritis	and	septic	arthritis	can	occur.	
Avascular	necrosis	is	not	a	feature	of	thalassemia	because	there	is	no	
sickling	of	red	cells	leading	to	thrombosis	and	infarction.

β	Thalassemia	minor	(also	known	as	β thalassemia trait)	is	likewise	
associated	 with	 joint	 manifestations.	 Chronic	 seronegative	 oligoar-
thritis	 affecting	 predominantly	 ankles,	 wrists,	 and	 elbows	 has	 been	
described;	the	affected	patients	had	mild	persistent	synovitis	without	
large	 effusions	 or	 joint	 erosions.	 Recurrent	 episodes	 of	 acute	 asym-
metric	 arthritis	 have	 also	 been	 reported;	 episodes	 last	 <1	 week	 and	
may	 affect	 the	 knees,	 ankles,	 shoulders,	 elbows,	 wrists,	 and	 metacar-
pophalangeal	 joints.	 The	 mechanism	 underlying	 this	 arthropathy	 is	
unknown.	Treatment	with	NSAIDs	is	not	particularly	effective.

 ■ MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS ASSOCIATED 
WITH HYPERLIPIDEMIA
(See  also  Chap.  407)	 Musculoskeletal	 or	 cutaneous	 manifestations	
may	be	the	first	clinical	indication	of	a	specific	hereditary	disorder	of	
lipoprotein	 metabolism.	 Patients	 with	 familial	 hypercholesterolemia	
(previously	 referred	 to	 as	 type  II  hyperlipoproteinemia)	 may	 have	
recurrent	migratory	polyarthritis	involving	the	knees	and	other	large	
peripheral	joints	and,	to	a	lesser	degree,	peripheral	small	joints.	Pain	
ranges	 from	 moderate	 to	 incapacitating.	 The	 involved	 joints	 can	 be	
warm,	 erythematous,	 swollen,	 and	 tender.	 Arthritis	 usually	 has	 a	
sudden	 onset,	 lasts	 from	 a	 few	 days	 to	 2	 weeks,	 and	 does	 not	 cause	
joint	damage.	Synovial	fluid	from	involved	joints	is	not	inflammatory	
and	 contains	 few	 white	 cells	 and	 no	 crystals.	 Joint	 involvement	 may	
actually	 represent	 inflammatory	 periarthritis	 or	 peritendinitis	 and	
not	true	arthritis.	The	recurrent,	transient	nature	of	the	arthritis	may	
suggest	acute	gout	or	rheumatic	fever,	especially	because	patients	with	
hyperlipoproteinemia	may	have	an	elevated	erythrocyte	sedimentation	
rate	and	elevated	antistreptolysin	O	titers	(the	latter	being	quite	com-
mon).	 Attacks	 of	 tendinitis,	 including	 the	 large	 Achilles	 and	 patellar	
tendons,	may	come	on	gradually	and	last	only	a	few	days	or	may	be	
acute,	 as	 described	 above.	 Patients	 may	 be	 asymptomatic	 between	
attacks.	Achilles	tendinitis	and	other	joint	manifestations	often	precede	
the	appearance	of	xanthomas	and	may	be	the	first	clinical	indication	

of	 hyperlipoproteinemia.	 Attacks	 of	 tendinitis	 may	 follow	 treatment	
with	a	lipid-lowering	drug.	Over	time,	patients	may	develop	tendinous	
xanthomas	in	the	Achilles,	patellar,	and	extensor	tendons	of	the	hands	
and	feet.	Xanthomas	have	also	been	reported	in	the	peroneal	tendon,	
the	plantar	aponeurosis,	and	the	periosteum	overlying	the	distal	tibia	
where	 they	 are	 located	 within	 tendon	 fibers.	 Tuberous	 xanthomas	
are	 soft	 subcutaneous	 masses	 located	 over	 the	 extensor	 surfaces	 of	
the	elbows,	knees,	and	hands	as	well	as	on	the	buttocks.	They	appear	
during	 childhood	 in	 homozygous	 patients	 and	 after	 the	 age	 of	 30	 in	
heterozygous	 patients.	 Patients	 with	 elevated	 plasma	 levels	 of	 very-
low-density	lipoprotein	(VLDL)	and	triglycerides	(previously	referred	
to	as	type IV hyperlipoproteinemia)	may	also	have	a	mild	inflammatory	
arthritis	affecting	large	and	small	peripheral	joints,	usually	in	an	asym-
metric	pattern,	with	only	a	few	joints	involved	at	a	time.	The	onset	of	
arthritis	is	typically	between	the	age	of	40	and	65	years.	Arthritis	may	
be	persistent	or	recurrent,	with	episodes	lasting	a	few	days	or	weeks.	
Severe	joint	pain	and	tenderness,	morning	stiffness,	and	periarticular	
hyperesthesia	 may	 also	 be	 present,	 as	 may	 synovial	 thickening.	 Joint	
fluid	 is	 usually	 noninflammatory	 and	 without	 crystals	 but	 may	 have	
increased	 white	 blood	 cell	 counts	 with	 predominantly	 mononuclear	
cells.	 Radiographs	 may	 show	 juxtaarticular	 osteopenia	 and	 cystic	
lesions.	Large	bone	cysts	have	been	noted	in	a	few	patients.	Xanthoma	
and	 bone	 cysts	 are	 also	 observed	 in	 other	 lipoprotein	 disorders.	 The	
pathogenesis	of	arthritis	in	patients	with	familial	hypercholesterolemia	
or	 with	 elevated	 levels	 of	 VLDL	 and	 triglycerides	 is	 not	 well	 under-
stood.	NSAIDs	or	analgesics	usually	provide	adequate	relief	of	symp-
toms	when	used	on	an	as-needed	basis.

Patients	 may	 improve	 clinically	 as	 they	 are	 treated	 with	 lipid-	
lowering	agents;	however,	patients	treated	with	an	HMG-CoA	reductase	
inhibitor	may	experience	myalgias,	and	a	few	patients	develop	myopa-
thy,	 myositis,	 or	 even	 rhabdomyolysis.	 Patients	 who	 develop	 myositis	
during	statin	therapy	may	be	susceptible	to	this	adverse	effect	because	of	
an	underlying	muscle	disorder	and	should	be	reevaluated	after	discon-
tinuation	of	the	drug.	Testing	for	anti–3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA	
reductase	(HMGCR)	autoantibodies	in	patients	with	elevated	muscle	
enzymes	 on	 treatment	 may	 identify	 patients	 with	 statin-induced	
necrotizing	 autoimmune	 myopathy.	 Myositis	 has	 also	 been	 reported	
with	the	use	of	niacin	(Chap. 365)	but	is	less	common	than	myalgias.

Musculoskeletal	 syndromes	 have	 not	 clearly	 been	 associated	 with	

the	more	common	mixed	hyperlipidemias	seen	in	general	practice.

OTHER ARTHRITIDES
 ■ NEUROPATHIC JOINT DISEASE
Neuropathic	joint	disease	(Charcot	joint)	is	a	progressive	destructive	
arthritis	associated	with	loss	of	pain	sensation,	proprioception,	or	both.	
Normal	muscular	reflexes	that	modulate	joint	movement	are	impaired.	
Without	these	protective	mechanisms,	joints	are	subjected	to	repeated	
trauma,	 resulting	 in	 progressive	 cartilage	 and	 bone	 damage.	 Today,	
diabetes	mellitus	is	the	most	frequent	cause	of	neuropathic	joint	disease	
(Fig.  374-1).	 A	 variety	 of	 other	 disorders	 are	 associated	 with	 neuro-
pathic	arthritis,	including	tabes	dorsalis,	leprosy,	yaws,	syringomyelia,	
meningomyelocele,	congenital	indifference	to	pain,	peroneal	muscular	
atrophy	(Charcot-Marie-Tooth	disease),	and	amyloidosis.	An	arthritis	
resembling	 neuropathic	 joint	 disease	 has	 been	 reported	 in	 patients	
who	have	received	intraarticular	glucocorticoid	injections,	but	this	is	a	
rare	complication	and	was	not	observed	in	one	series	of	patients	with	
knee	 osteoarthritis	 who	 received	 intraarticular	 glucocorticoid	 injec-
tions	every	3	months	for	2	years.	The	distribution	of	joint	involvement	
depends	on	the	underlying	neurologic	disorder	(Table 374-2).	In	tabes	
dorsalis,	 the	 knees,	 hips,	 and	 ankles	 are	 most	 commonly	 affected;	 in	
syringomyelia,	the	glenohumeral	joint,	elbow,	and	wrist;	and	in	diabe-
tes	mellitus,	the	tarsal	and	tarsometatarsal	joints.

 ■ PATHOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The	 pathologic	 changes	 in	 the	 neuropathic	 joint	 are	 similar	 to	 those	
found	 in	 the	 severe	 osteoarthritic	 joint.	 There	 is	 fragmentation	 and	
eventual	 loss	 of	 articular	 cartilage	 with	 eburnation	 of	 the	 underlying

the	metatarsal	heads	and	may	lead	to	infected	ulcers	and	osteomyelitis.	
The	 value	 of	 protective	 inserts	 and	 orthotics,	 as	 well	 as	 regular	 foot	
examination,	cannot	be	overstated.	Radiographs	may	show	resorption	
and	tapering	of	the	distal	metatarsal	bones.	The	term	Lisfranc fracture-
dislocation	is	sometimes	used	to	describe	the	destructive	changes	at	the	
tarsometatarsal	joints.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The	diagnosis	of	neuropathic	arthritis	is	based	on	the	clinical	features	
and	characteristic	radiographic	findings	in	a	patient	with	underlying	
sensory	neuropathy.	The	differential	diagnosis	of	neuropathic	arthritis	
depends	 upon	 the	 severity	 of	 the	 process	 and	 includes	 osteomyeli-
tis,	 avascular	 necrosis,	 advanced	 osteoarthritis,	 stress	 fractures,	 and	
calcium	 pyrophosphate	 deposition	 disease.	 Radiographs	 in	 neuro-
pathic	 arthritis	 initially	 show	 changes	 of	 osteoarthritis	 with	 joint	
space	 narrowing,	 subchondral	 bone	 sclerosis,	 osteophytes,	 and	 joint	
effusions;	 marked	 destructive	 and	 hypertrophic	 changes	 follow	 later.	
The	radiographic	findings	of	neuropathic	arthritis	may	be	difficult	to	
differentiate	from	those	of	osteomyelitis,	especially	in	the	diabetic	foot.	
The	joint	margins	in	a	neuropathic	joint	tend	to	be	distinct,	while	in	
osteomyelitis,	 they	 are	 blurred.	 Imaging	 studies	 may	 be	 helpful,	 but	
cultures	of	tissue	from	the	joint	are	often	required	to	exclude	osteomy-
elitis.	MRI	and	bone	scans	using	indium-111–labeled	white	blood	cells	
or	indium-111–labeled	immunoglobulin	G,	which	will	show	increased	
uptake	 in	 osteomyelitis	 but	 not	 in	 a	 neuropathic	 joint,	 may	 be	 use-
ful.	 A	 technetium	 bone	 scan	 will	 not	 distinguish	 osteomyelitis	 from	
neuropathic	 arthritis,	 as	 increased	 uptake	 is	 observed	 in	 both.	 The	
joint	fluid	in	neuropathic	arthritis	is	noninflammatory;	it	may	be	xan-
thochromic	or	even	bloody	and	may	contain	fragments	of	synovium,	
cartilage,	and	bone.	The	finding	of	calcium	pyrophosphate	dihydrate	
crystals	 supports	 the	 diagnosis	 of	 crystal-associated	 arthropathy.	 In	
the	absence	of	such	crystals,	an	increased	number	of	leukocytes	may	
indicate	osteomyelitis.

TREATMENT
Neuropathic Joint Disease

The	primary	focus	of	treatment	is	to	stabilize	the	joint.	Treatment	
of	the	underlying	disorder,	even	if	successful,	does	not	usually	affect	
established	 joint	 disease.	 Braces	 and	 splints	 are	 helpful.	 Their	 use	
requires	close	surveillance,	because	patients	may	be	unable	to	appre-
ciate	pressure	from	a	poorly	adjusted	brace.	In	the	diabetic	patient,	
early	 recognition	 of	 Charcot	 foot	 and	 its	 treatment—prohibition	
of	 weight	 bearing	 by	 the	 foot	 for	 at	 least	 8	 weeks—may	 possibly	
prevent	severe	disease	from	developing.	Fusion	of	an	unstable	joint	
may	improve	function	and	reduce	pain,	but	nonunion	is	frequent,	
especially	when	immobilization	of	the	joint	is	inadequate.

 ■ HYPERTROPHIC OSTEOARTHROPATHY  
AND CLUBBING
Hypertrophic	osteoarthropathy	(HOA)	is	characterized	by	clubbing	of	
digits	and,	in	more	advanced	stages,	by	periosteal	new	bone	formation	
and	 synovial	 effusions.	 HOA	 may	 be	 primary	 or	 familial	 and	 may	
begin	 in	 childhood.	 Secondary	 HOA	 is	 associated	 with	 intrathoracic	
malignancies,	suppurative	and	some	hypoxemic	lung	diseases,	congen-
ital	heart	disease,	and	a	variety	of	other	disorders.	Clubbing	is	almost	
always	 a	 feature	 of	 HOA	 but	 can	 also	 occur	 as	 an	 isolated	 finding	 
(Fig. 374-2).	The	presence	of	clubbing	in	isolation	may	be	congenital	
or	 represent	 either	 an	 early	 stage	 or	 one	 element	 in	 the	 spectrum	 of	
HOA.	Isolated	acquired	clubbing	has	the	same	clinical	significance	as	
clubbing	associated	with	periostitis.

Pathology and Pathophysiology of Acquired HOA 
In	HOA,	
bone	changes	in	the	distal	extremities	begin	as	periostitis	followed	by	
new	bone	formation.	At	this	stage,	a	radiolucent	area	may	be	observed	
between	the	new	periosteal	bone	and	the	subjacent	cortex.	As	the	pro-
cess	progresses,	multiple	layers	of	new	bone	are	deposited	and	become	
contiguous	with	the	cortex,	with	consequent	cortical	thickening.	The	
outer	portion	of	the	bone	is	laminated	in	appearance,	with	an	irregular

disease,	erosions	are	present	on	the	joint	surface.	Fractures,	devitalized	
bone,	intraarticular	loose	bodies,	and	microscopic	fragments	of	carti-
lage	and	bone	may	be	present.

At	least	two	underlying	mechanisms	are	believed	to	be	involved	in	
the	 pathogenesis	 of	 neuropathic	 arthritis.	 An	 abnormal	 autonomic	
nervous	system	is	thought	to	be	responsible	for	the	dysregulated	blood	
flow	to	the	joint	with	subsequent	resorption	of	bone.	Loss	of	bone,	par-
ticularly	in	the	diabetic	foot,	may	be	the	initial	finding.	With	the	loss	
of	 deep	 pain,	 proprioception,	 and	 protective	 neuromuscular	 reflexes,	
the	joint	is	subjected	to	repeated	microtrauma,	resulting	in	ligamental	
tears	and	bone	fractures.	The	injury	that	follows	frequent	intraarticular	
glucocorticoid	injections	is	thought	to	be	due	to	the	analgesic	effect	of	
glucocorticoids,	 leading	 to	 overuse	 of	 an	 already	 damaged	 joint;	 the	
result	 is	 accelerated	 cartilage	 damage,	 although	 steroid-induced	 car-
tilage	damage	is	more	common	in	some	other	animal	species	than	in	
humans.	It	is	not	understood	why	only	a	few	patients	with	neuropathy	
develop	clinically	evident	neuropathic	arthritis.
 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Neuropathic	 joint	 disease	 usually	 begins	 in	 a	 single	 joint	 and	 then	
becomes	apparent	in	other	joints,	depending	on	the	underlying	neu-
rologic	disorder.	The	involved	joint	becomes	progressively	enlarged	as	
a	result	of	bony	overgrowth	and	synovial	effusion.	Loose	bodies	may	
be	palpated	in	the	joint	cavity.	Joint	instability,	subluxation,	and	crep-
itus	 occur	 as	 the	 disease	 progresses.	 Neuropathic	 joints	 may	 develop	
rapidly,	and	a	totally	disorganized	joint	with	multiple	bony	fragments	
may	evolve	within	weeks	or	months.	The	amount	of	pain	experienced	
by	the	patient	is	less	than	would	be	anticipated	from	the	degree	of	joint	
damage.	Patients	may	experience	sudden	joint	pain	from	intraarticular	
fractures	of	osteophytes	or	condyles.

Neuropathic	 arthritis	 is	 encountered	 most	 often	 in	 patients	 with	
diabetes	 mellitus,	 with	 an	 incidence	 of	 ~0.5%.	 The	 onset	 of	 disease	
usually	comes	at	an	age	of	≥50	years	in	a	patient	who	has	had	diabetes	
for	several	years,	but	exceptions	occur.	The	tarsal	and	tarsometatarsal	
joints	 are	 most	 often	 affected,	 with	 the	 metatarsophalangeal	 and	 tal-
otibial	joints	next	most	commonly	involved.	The	knees	and	spine	are	
occasionally	involved.	Patients	often	attribute	the	onset	of	foot	pain	to	
antecedent	trauma	such	as	twisting	of	the	foot.	Neuropathic	changes	
may	develop	rapidly	after	a	foot	fracture	or	dislocation.	The	foot	and	
ankle	are	often	swollen.	Downward	collapse	of	the	tarsal	bones	leads	to	
convexity	of	the	sole,	referred	to	as	a	“rocker	foot.”	Large	osteophytes	
may	protrude	from	the	top	of	the	foot.	Calluses	frequently	form	over

corrugated,	 a	 feature	 that	 has	 been	 descriptively	 termed	 cutis  verticis 
gyrata.	The	distal	extremities,	particularly	the	legs,	become	thickened	
as	a	consequence	of	the	proliferation	of	new	bone	and	soft	tissue;	when	
the	process	is	extensive,	the	distal	lower	extremities	resemble	those	of	
an	elephant.	The	periostitis	usually	is	not	painful,	which	it	can	be	in	
secondary	 HOA.	 Clubbing	 of	 the	 fingers	 may	 be	 extensive,	 produc-
ing	 large,	 bulbous	 deformities,	 and	 clumsiness.	 Clubbing	 also	 affects	
the	 toes.	 Patients	 may	 experience	 articular	 and	 periarticular	 pain,	
especially	 in	 the	 ankles	 and	 knees,	 and	 joint	 motion	 may	 be	 mildly	
restricted	 by	 periarticular	 bone	 overgrowth.	 Noninflammatory	 effu-
sions	 occur	 in	 the	 wrists,	 knees,	 and	 ankles.	 Synovial	 hypertrophy	 is	
not	found.	Associated	abnormalities	observed	in	patients	with	primary	
HOA	 include	 hypertrophic	 gastropathy,	 bone	 marrow	 failure,	 female	
escutcheon,	gynecomastia,	and	cranial	suture	defects.	In	patients	with	
primary	HOA,	the	symptoms	disappear	when	adulthood	is	reached.

HOA	 secondary	 to	 an	 underlying	 disease	 occurs	 more	 frequently	
than	primary	HOA.	It	accompanies	a	variety	of	disorders	and	may	pre-
cede	clinical	features	of	the	associated	disorder	by	months.	Clubbing	is	
more	frequent	than	the	full	syndrome	of	HOA	in	patients	with	asso-
ciated	illnesses.	Because	clubbing	evolves	over	months	and	is	usually	
asymptomatic,	it	is	often	recognized	first	by	the	physician	and	not	the	
patient.	Patients	may	experience	a	burning	sensation	in	their	fingertips.	
Clubbing	is	characterized	by	widening	of	the	fingertips,	enlargement	of	
the	distal	volar	pad,	convexity	of	the	nail	contour,	and	the	loss	of	the	
normal	15°	angle	between	the	proximal	nail	and	cuticle.	The	thickness	
of	the	digit	at	the	base	of	the	nail	is	greater	than	the	thickness	at	the	dis-
tal	interphalangeal	joint.	An	objective	measurement	of	finger	clubbing	
can	be	made	by	determining	the	diameter	at	the	base	of	the	nail	and	
at	the	distal	interphalangeal	joint	of	all	10	digits.	Clubbing	is	present	
when	the	sum	of	the	individual	digit	ratios	is	>10.	At	the	bedside,	club-
bing	can	be	appreciated	by	having	the	patient	place	the	dorsal	surface	
of	 the	 distal	 phalanges	 of	 the	 fourth	 fingers	 together	 with	 the	 nails	
opposing	 each	 other.	 Normally,	 an	 open	 area	 is	 visible	 between	 the	
bases	of	the	opposing	fingernails;	when	clubbing	is	present,	this	open	
space	is	no	longer	visible.	The	base	of	the	nail	feels	spongy	when	com-
pressed,	and	the	nail	can	be	easily	rocked	on	its	bed.	When	clubbing	is	
advanced,	the	finger	may	have	a	drumstick	appearance,	and	the	distal	
interphalangeal	joint	can	be	hyperextended.	Periosteal	involvement	in	
the	 distal	 extremities	 may	 produce	 a	 burning	 or	 deep-seated	 aching	
pain.	 The	 pain,	 which	 can	 be	 quite	 incapacitating,	 is	 aggravated	 by	
dependency	 and	 relieved	 by	 elevation	 of	 the	 affected	 limbs.	 Pressure	
applied	over	the	distal	forearms	and	legs	or	gentle	percussion	of	distal	
long	bones	like	the	tibia	may	be	quite	painful.

Patients	may	experience	joint	pain,	most	often	in	the	ankles,	wrists,	
and	knees.	Joint	effusions	may	be	present	but	are	usually	noninflam-
matory.	The	small	joints	of	the	hands	are	rarely	affected.	Severe	joint	or	
long	bone	pain	may	be	the	presenting	symptom	of	an	underlying	lung	
malignancy	and	may	precede	the	appearance	of	clubbing.	In	addition,	
the	progression	of	HOA	tends	to	be	more	rapid	when	associated	with	
malignancies,	 most	 notably	 bronchogenic	 carcinoma.	 Noninflamma-
tory	but	variably	painful	knee	effusions	may	occur	prior	to	the	onset	
of	clubbing	and	symptoms	of	distal	periostitis.	Unlike	primary	HOA,	
secondary	 HOA	 does	 not	 commonly	 include	 excessive	 sweating	 and	
oiliness	of	the	skin	or	thickening	of	the	facial	skin.

HOA	occurs	in	5–10%	of	patients	with	intrathoracic	malignancies,	
the	most	common	being	bronchogenic	carcinoma	and	pleural	tumors	
(Table 374-3).	Lung	metastases	infrequently	cause	HOA.	HOA	is	also	
seen	in	patients	with	intrathoracic	infections,	including	lung	abscesses,	
empyema,	and	bronchiectasis,	but	is	uncommon	in	pulmonary	tuber-
culosis.	HOA	may	accompany	chronic	interstitial	pneumonitis,	sarcoi-
dosis,	and	cystic	fibrosis.	In	cystic	fibrosis,	clubbing	is	more	common	
than	the	full	syndrome	of	HOA.	Other	causes	of	clubbing	include	con-
genital	 heart	 disease	 with	 right-to-left	 shunts,	 bacterial	 endocarditis,	
Crohn’s	disease,	ulcerative	colitis,	sprue,	and	neoplasms	of	the	esoph-
agus,	liver,	and	small	and	large	bowel.	In	patients	who	have	congenital	
heart	 disease	 with	 right-to-left	 shunts,	 clubbing	 alone	 occurs	 more	
often	than	the	full	syndrome	of	HOA.

Unilateral	clubbing	has	been	found	in	association	with	aneurysms	
of	 major	 extremity	 arteries,	 with	 infected	 arterial	 grafts,	 and	 with

surface.	Initially,	the	process	of	periosteal	new	bone	formation	involves	
the	proximal	and	distal	diaphyses	of	the	tibia,	fibula,	radius,	and	ulna	
and,	less	frequently,	the	femur,	humerus,	metacarpals,	metatarsals,	and	
phalanges.	Occasionally,	scapulae,	clavicles,	ribs,	and	pelvic	bones	are	
also	affected.	The	adjacent	interosseous	membranes	may	become	ossi-
fied.	 The	 distribution	 of	 bone	 manifestations	 is	 usually	 bilateral	 and	
symmetric.	The	soft	tissue	overlying	the	distal	third	of	the	arms	and	
legs	may	be	thickened.	Proliferation	of	connective	tissue	occurs	in	the	
nail	bed	and	volar	pad	of	digits,	giving	the	distal	phalanges	a	clubbed	
appearance.	Small	blood	vessels	in	the	clubbed	digits	are	dilated	and	
have	thickened	walls.	In	addition,	the	number	of	arteriovenous	anas-
tomoses	is	increased.

Several	theories	have	been	suggested	for	the	pathogenesis	of	HOA,	
but	 many	 have	 been	 disproved	 or	 have	 not	 explained	 the	 condition’s	
development	 in	 all	 clinical	 disorders	 with	 which	 it	 is	 associated.	
Previously	 proposed	 neurogenic	 and	 humoral	 theories	 are	 no	 longer	
considered	 likely	 explanations	 for	 HOA.	 Studies	 have	 suggested	 a	
role	 for	 platelets	 in	 the	 development	 of	 HOA.	 It	 has	 been	 observed	
that	megakaryocytes	and	large	platelet	particles	present	in	the	venous	
circulation	 are	 fragmented	 in	 their	 passage	 through	 normal	 lung.	 In	
patients	with	cyanotic	congenital	heart	disease	and	in	other	disorders	
associated	with	right-to-left	shunts,	these	large	platelet	particles	bypass	
the	 lung	 and	 reach	 the	 distal	 extremities,	 where	 they	 can	 interact	
with	endothelial	cells.	Platelet–endothelial	cell	activation	in	the	distal	
portion	of	the	extremities	may	result	in	the	release	of	platelet-derived	
growth	factor	(PDGF)	and	other	factors	leading	to	the	proliferation	of	
connective	tissue	and	periosteum.	Stimulation	of	fibroblasts	by	PDGF	
and	transforming	growth	factor	β	results	in	cell	growth	and	collagen	
synthesis.	 Elevated	 plasma	 levels	 of	 von	 Willebrand	 factor	 antigen	
have	been	found	in	patients	with	both	primary	and	secondary	forms	
of	 HOA,	 indicating	 endothelial	 activation	 or	 damage.	 Abnormalities	
of	collagen	synthesis	have	been	demonstrated	in	the	involved	skin	of	
patients	with	primary	HOA.	Other	factors	are	undoubtedly	involved	in	
the	pathogenesis	of	HOA,	and	further	studies	are	needed	to	elucidate	
this	disorder.

Clinical Manifestations  Primary	 or	 familial	 HOA,	 also	 referred	
to	as	pachydermoperiostitis	or	Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome,	usually	
begins	insidiously	at	puberty.	In	a	smaller	proportion	of	patients,	the	
onset	 comes	 in	 the	 first	 year	 of	 life.	 The	 disorder	 is	 inherited	 as	 an	
autosomal	 dominant	 trait	 with	 variable	 expression	 and	 is	 nine	 times	
more	common	among	boys	than	among	girls.	Approximately	one-third	
of	patients	have	a	family	history	of	primary	HOA.

Primary	HOA	is	characterized	by	clubbing,	periostitis,	and	unusual	
skin	features.	A	small	number	of	patients	with	this	syndrome	do	not	
express	clubbing.	The	skin	changes	and	periostitis	are	prominent	fea-
tures	of	this	syndrome.	The	skin	becomes	thickened	and	coarse.	Deep	
nasolabial	 folds	 develop,	 and	 the	 forehead	 may	 become	 furrowed.	
Patients	 may	 have	 heavy-appearing	 eyelids	 and	 ptosis.	 The	 skin	 is	
often	 greasy,	 and	 there	 may	 be	 excessive	 sweating	 of	 the	 hands	 and	
feet.	Patients	may	also	experience	acne	vulgaris,	seborrhea,	and	follic-
ulitis.	In	a	few	patients,	the	skin	over	the	scalp	becomes	very	thick	and

arteriovenous	 fistulas	 of	 brachial	 vessels.	 Clubbing	 of	 the	 toes	 but	
not	the	fingers	has	been	associated	with	an	infected	abdominal	aortic	
aneurysm	and	patent	ductus	arteriosus.	Clubbing	of	a	single	digit	may	
follow	trauma	and	has	been	reported	in	tophaceous	gout	and	sarcoido-
sis.	While	clubbing	occurs	more	commonly	than	the	full	syndrome	in	
most	diseases,	periostitis	in	the	absence	of	clubbing	has	been	observed	
in	the	affected	limb	of	patients	with	infected	arterial	grafts.

Hyperthyroidism	 (Graves’	 disease),	 treated	 or	 untreated,	 is	 occa-
sionally	 associated	 with	 clubbing	 and	 periostitis	 of	 the	 bones	 of	 the	
hands	 and	 feet.	 This	 condition	 is	 referred	 to	 as	 thyroid  acropachy.	
Periostitis	may	be	asymptomatic	and	occurs	in	the	midshaft	and	dia-
physeal	 portion	 of	 the	 metacarpal	 and	 phalangeal	 bones.	 Significant	
hand-joint	pain	may	occur,	which	may	respond	to	successful	therapy	
for	thyroid	dysfunction.	The	long	bones	of	the	extremities	are	seldom	
affected.	Elevated	levels	of	long-acting	thyroid	stimulator	are	found	in	
the	sera	of	these	patients.

Laboratory  Findings  The	 laboratory	 abnormalities	 reflect	 the	
underlying	 disorder.	 The	 synovial	 fluid	 of	 involved	 joints	 has	 <500	
white	 cells/μL,	 and	 the	 cells	 are	 predominantly	 mononuclear.	 Radio-
graphs	show	a	faint	radiolucent	line	beneath	the	new	periosteal	bone	
along	 the	 shaft	 of	 long	 bones	 at	 their	 distal	 end.	 These	 changes	 are	
observed	most	frequently	at	the	ankles,	wrists,	and	knees.	The	ends	of	
the	distal	phalanges	may	show	osseous	resorption.	Radionuclide	stud-
ies	show	pericortical	linear	uptake	along	the	cortical	margins	of	long	
bones	that	may	precede	any	radiographic	changes.

TREATMENT
Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy

The	treatment	of	HOA	aims	to	identify	and	treat	the	associated	dis-
order.	The	symptoms	and	signs	of	HOA	may	disappear	completely	
with	 removal	 of	 or	 effective	 chemotherapy	 for	 a	 tumor	 or	 with	
antibiotic	therapy	for	a	chronic	pulmonary	infection	and	drainage	
of	the	infected	site.	Vagotomy	or	percutaneous	block	of	the	vagus	
nerve	leads	to	symptomatic	relief	in	some	patients.	NSAIDs	or	anal-
gesics	may	help	control	symptoms	of	HOA.

 ■ COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME
The	reflex	sympathetic	dystrophy	syndrome	is	now	referred	to	as	com-
plex regional pain syndrome, type 1,	according	to	the	new	classification	

system	of	the	International	Association	for	the	Study	of	Pain.	This	syn-
drome	is	characterized	by	pain	and	swelling,	usually	of	a	distal	extrem-
ity,	 accompanied	 by	 vasomotor	 instability,	 trophic	 skin	 changes,	 and	
the	 rapid	 development	 of	 bony	 demineralization.	 Complex	 regional	
pain	syndrome,	including	its	treatment,	is	covered	in	greater	detail	in	
Chap. 440.

 ■ TIETZE SYNDROME AND COSTOCHONDRITIS
Tietze	 syndrome	 is	 manifested	 by	 painful	 swelling	 of	 one	 or	 more	
costochondral	 articulations.	 The	 age	 of	 onset	 is	 usually	 before	 40,	
and	both	sexes	are	affected	equally.	In	most	patients,	only	one	joint	is	
involved,	usually	the	second	or	third	costochondral	joint.	The	onset	of	
anterior	chest	pain	may	be	sudden	or	gradual.	The	pain	may	radiate	to	
the	arms	or	shoulders	and	is	aggravated	by	sneezing,	coughing,	deep	
inspirations,	or	twisting	motions	of	the	chest.	The	term	costochondritis	
is	often	used	interchangeably	with	Tietze syndrome,	but	some	restrict	
the	 former	 term	 to	 pain	 of	 the	 costochondral	 articulations	 without	
swelling.	 Costochondritis	 is	 observed	 in	 patients	 aged	 >40	 years;	 it	
tends	 to	 affect	 the	 third,	 fourth,	 and	 fifth	 costochondral	 joints,	 and	
occurs	more	often	in	women.	Both	syndromes	may	superficially	mimic	
cardiac	 or	 upper	 abdominal	 causes	 of	 pain.	 Rheumatoid	 arthritis,	
ankylosing	spondylitis,	and	reactive	arthritis	may	involve	costochon-
dral	joints	but	are	distinguished	easily	by	their	other	clinical	features.	
Other	skeletal	causes	of	anterior	chest	wall	pain	are	xiphoidalgia	and	
the	 slipping	 rib	 syndrome,	 which	 usually	 involves	 the	 tenth	 rib	 and	
causes	 reproducible	 pain	 below	 the	 rib	 cage.	 Malignancies	 such	 as	
breast	 cancer,	 prostate	 cancer,	 plasma	 cell	 cytoma,	 and	 sarcoma	 can	
invade	 the	 ribs,	 thoracic	 spine,	 or	 chest	 wall	 and	 produce	 symptoms	
suggesting	Tietze’s	syndrome.	Patients	with	osteomalacia	may	have	sig-
nificant	rib	pain,	with	or	without	documented	microfractures.	These	
conditions	 should	 be	 distinguishable	 by	 radiography,	 bone	 scanning,	
vitamin	 D	 measurement,	 or	 biopsy.	 Analgesics,	 NSAIDs,	 and	 local	
glucocorticoid	injections	usually	relieve	symptoms	of	costochondritis/
Tietze’s	syndrome.	Care	should	be	taken	to	avoid	overdiagnosing	these	
syndromes	in	patients	with	acute	chest	pain	syndromes.

 ■ MYOFASCIAL PAIN SYNDROME
Myofascial	pain	syndrome	is	characterized	by	multiple	areas	of	local-
ized	 musculoskeletal	 pain	 and	 tenderness	 in	 association	 with	 tender	
points.	 The	 pain	 is	 deep	 and	 aching	 and	 may	 be	 accompanied	 by	 a	
burning	sensation.	Myofascial	pain	may	be	regional	and	follow	trauma,	
overuse,	or	prolonged	static	contraction	of	a	muscle	or	muscle	group,	
which	may	occur	when	an	individual	is	reading	or	writing	at	a	desk	or	
working	at	a	computer.	In	addition,	this	syndrome	may	be	associated	
with	 underlying	 osteoarthritis	 of	 the	 neck	 or	 low	 back.	 Pain	 may	 be	
referred	from	tender	points	to	defined	areas	distant	from	the	area	of	
original	tenderness.	Palpation	of	the	tender	point	reproduces	or	accen-
tuates	the	pain.	The	tender	points	are	usually	located	in	the	center	of	
a	 muscle	 belly,	 but	 they	 can	 occur	 at	 other	 sites	 such	 as	 costosternal	
junctions,	the	xiphoid	process,	ligamentous	and	tendinous	insertions,	
fascia,	and	fatty	areas.	Tender	point	sites	in	muscle	have	been	described	
as	feeling	indurated	and	taut,	and	palpation	may	cause	the	muscle	to	
twitch.	These	findings,	however,	have	been	shown	not	to	be	unique	to	
myofascial	pain	syndrome:	in	a	controlled	study,	they	were	also	pres-
ent	 in	 some	 “normal”	 subjects.	 Myofascial	 pain	 most	 often	 involves	
the	 posterior	 neck,	 low	 back,	 shoulders,	 and	 chest.	 Chronic	 pain	 in	
the	muscles	of	the	posterior	neck	may	involve	referral	of	pain	from	a	
tender	point	in	the	erector	neck	muscle	or	upper	trapezius	to	the	head,	
leading	to	persistent	headaches	that	may	last	for	days.	Tender	points	in	
the	paraspinal	muscles	of	the	low	back	may	refer	pain	to	the	buttock.	
Pain	may	be	referred	down	the	leg	from	a	tender	point	in	the	gluteus	
medius	 and	 can	 mimic	 sciatica.	 A	 tender	 point	 in	 the	 infraspinatus	
muscle	 may	 produce	 local	 and	 referred	 pain	 over	 the	 lateral	 deltoid	
and	 down	 the	 outside	 of	 the	 arm	 into	 the	 hand.	 Injection	 of	 a	 local	
anesthetic	such	as	1%	lidocaine	into	the	tender	point	site	often	results	
in	 transient	 pain	 relief.	 Another	 useful	 technique	 is	 first	 to	 spray	 an	
agent	such	as	ethyl	chloride	from	the	tender	point	toward	the	area	of	
referred	pain	and	then	to	stretch	the	muscle.	This	maneuver	may	need	
to	be	repeated	several	times.	Massage	and	application	of	ultrasound	to

the	affected	area	also	may	be	beneficial.	Patients	should	be	instructed	
in	methods	to	prevent	muscle	stresses	related	to	work	and	recreation.	
The	 prognosis	 in	 most	 patients	 is	 good.	 In	 some	 patients,	 regionally	
localized	myofascial	pain	syndrome	may	evolve	into	more	generalized	
fibromyalgia	(Chap. 373).	Nonrestorative	sleep	is	a	common	accom-
paniment	in	these	patients	and	may	need	to	be	specifically	addressed.
 ■ NEOPLASIAS AND ARTHRITIS
Primary	tumors	and	tumor-like	disorders	of	synovium	are	uncommon	
but	should	be	considered	in	the	differential	diagnosis	of	monarticular	
joint	disease.	In	addition,	metastases	to	bone	and	primary	bone	tumors	
adjacent	to	a	joint	may	produce	joint	symptoms.

Pigmented  villonodular  synovitis	 (PVNS),	 likely	 the	 same	 process	
causing	tenosynovial	giant	cell	tumors,	is	characterized	by	the	slowly	
progressive,	 benign	 proliferation	 of	 tenosynovial	 tissue.	 This	 usually	
involves	a	single	large	joint	or	tendon.	The	most	common	age	of	onset	
is	in	the	third	decade,	and	women	are	affected	slightly	more	often	than	
men.	 The	 proliferating	 tissue	 usually	 displays	 clonal	 chromosomal	
translocations;	most	of	these	aberrations	appear	to	involve	the	colony	
stimulating	factor-1	(CSF-1)	pathway,	which	influences	the	prolifera-
tion	and	maturation	of	mononuclear	cells	and	macrophages.

The	synovium	has	a	brownish	color	and	numerous	large,	fingerlike	
villi	that	fuse	to	form	pedunculated	nodules.	There	is	marked	hyper-
plasia	of	synovial	cells	in	the	stroma	of	the	villi.	Hemosiderin	and	lipids	
are	found	in	the	cytoplasm	of	macrophages	and	in	the	interstitial	tissue.	
Multinucleated	giant	cells	may	be	present.	The	proliferative	synovium	
may	behave	as	a	simple	mass	or	as	a	more	diffuse	invasive	tissue	grow-
ing	into	the	adjacent	cartilage	and	bone.

The	clinical	picture	of	PVNS	is	characterized	by	the	insidious	onset	
of	 progressive	 swelling	 and	 pain	 in	 affected	 joints	 or	 tendons,	 most	
commonly	the	knee	or	flexor	tendons	of	the	hand.	Other	commonly	
affected	joints	include	the	hips,	ankles,	calcaneocuboid	joints,	elbows,	
and	small	joints	of	the	fingers	or	toes;	multifocal	form	is	less	common.	
Tendon	sheaths	in	the	wrist,	ankle,	or	foot	may	be	involved.	Symptoms	
of	 pain,	 a	 catching	 sensation,	 or	 stiffness	 may	 initially	 be	 mild	 and	
intermittent	and	may	be	present	for	years	before	the	patient	seeks	med-
ical	attention.	Radiographs	may	show	joint	space	narrowing,	erosions,	
and	 subchondral	 cysts.	 The	 diagnosis	 of	 PVNS	 is	 strongly	 suggested	
by	 gradient	 echo	 MRI,	 which	 reveals	 a	 synovial	 mass	 lesion	 of	 low	
signal	intensity	typical	of	tissue	containing	hemosiderin	(Fig. 374-3).	
The	joint	fluid	contains	blood	and	is	dark	red	or	almost	black	in	color.	
Lipid-containing	macrophages	may	be	present	in	the	fluid.	The	joint	
fluid	may	be	clear	if	hemorrhage	has	not	occurred.

The	 treatment	 for	 PVNS,	 if	 needed,	 is	 complete	 open	 or	 arthro-
scopic	synovectomy.	Irradiation	of	the	involved	joint	has	been	success-
ful	in	some	patients	but	may	cause	a	delayed	malignant	transformation.

Treatment	 directed	 at	 inhibiting	 the	 CSF-1	 pathway	 activated	 kinase	
has	demonstrated	efficacy.

Synovial chondromatosis	is	a	disorder	characterized	by	multiple	focal	
metaplastic	growths	of	normal-appearing	cartilage	in	the	synovium	or	
tendon	sheath.	Segments	of	cartilage	break	loose	and	continue	to	grow	
as	 loose	 bodies.	 When	 calcification	 and	 ossification	 of	 loose	 bodies	
occur,	the	disorder	is	referred	to	as	synovial osteochondromatosis.	The	
disorder	 is	 usually	 monarticular	 and	 affects	 young	 to	 middle-aged	
individuals.	The	knee	is	most	often	involved,	followed	by	hip,	elbow,	
and	shoulder.	Symptoms	are	pain,	swelling,	and	decreased	motion	of	
the	joint.	Radiographs	may	show	several	rounded	calcifications	within	
the	joint	cavity.	Treatment	is	synovectomy;	however,	as	in	PVNS,	the	
growths	may	recur.

Synovial sarcoma	is	a	malignant	neoplasm	often	found	near	a	large	
joint	of	both	upper	and	lower	extremities,	being	more	common	in	the	
lower	extremity.	It	seldom	arises	within	the	joint	itself.	Synovial	sarco-
mas	constitute	10%	of	soft	tissue	sarcomas.	The	tumor	is	believed	to	
arise	from	primitive	mesenchymal	tissue	that	differentiates	into	epithe-
lial	cells	and/or	spindle	cells.	Small	foci	of	calcification	may	be	present	
in	the	tumor	mass.	Synovial	sarcoma	occurs	most	often	in	young	adults	
and	is	more	common	in	men.	The	tumor	presents	as	a	slowly	growing	
deep-seated	 mass	 near	 a	 joint,	 without	 much	 pain.	 The	 area	 of	 the	
knee	is	the	most	common	site,	followed	by	the	foot,	ankle,	elbow,	and	
shoulder.	 Other	 primary	 sites	 include	 the	 buttocks,	 abdominal	 wall,	
retroperitoneum,	and	mediastinum.	The	diagnosis	is	made	by	biopsy	
and	 must	 be	 distinguished	 from	 PVNS.	 Treatment	 consists	 of	 wide	
resection	of	the	tumor,	including	adjacent	muscle	and	regional	lymph	
nodes,	followed	by	chemotherapy	and	radiation	therapy.	Amputation	
of	the	involved	distal	extremity	may	be	required.	Chemotherapy	may	
be	beneficial	in	some	patients	with	metastatic	disease.	Isolated	sites	of	
pulmonary	metastasis	can	be	surgically	removed.	The	5-year	survival	
rate	with	treatment	depends	on	the	staging	of	the	tumor,	ranging	from	
~25%	to	≥60%.	Synovial	sarcomas	tend	to	recur	locally	and	metastasize	
to	regional	lymph	nodes,	lungs,	and	skeleton.

In	addition	to	the	rare	direct	metastases	of	solid	cell	tumors	to	the	
highly	 vascular	 synovium,	 neoplasia	 arising	 from	 nonarticular	 organ	
sites	can	affect	joints	in	other	ways.	Acute	leukemias	in	children	can	
mimic	 juvenile	 systemic	 inflammatory	 arthritis	 with	 severe	 joint	
pain	 and	 fever.	 In	 adults,	 chronic	 and	 acute	 myeloid	 leukemia	 rarely	
infiltrate	 the	 synovium.	 Hairy	 cell	 leukemia	 has	 a	 peculiar	 tendency	
to	cause	episodic	inflammatory	oligoarthritis	and	tenosynovitis;	these	
episodes	 are	 dramatic	 and	 mimic	 acute	 gout	 flares.	 They	 respond	 to	
potent	anti-inflammatory	therapy	with	glucocorticoids;	with	remission	
of	the	leukemia,	they	may	abate.	Lymphomas,	usually	of	T-cell	origin,	
may	also	involve	the	synovium.

Carcinomas	can	be	associated	with	several	paraneoplastic	articular	
syndromes,	 including	 HOA	 (discussed	 above).	 Acute	 palmar	 fasciitis	
with	polyarthritis	is	a	well-described	but	rare	condition	associated	with	
certain	cancers,	mainly	adenocarcinomas.	Clinically,	this	syndrome	is	
abrupt	 in	 onset,	 with	 pain	 in	 the	 metacarpophalangeal	 and	 proximal	
interphalangeal	joints	of	the	hands	and	rapidly	evolving	contractures	of	
the	fingers	due	to	thickening	of	the	palmar	(flexor)	tendons.	A	similar	
syndrome,	although	less	dramatic	in	onset,	can	occur	in	diabetics.	Para-
neoplastic	arthritis	has	been	described	and	may	occur	in	several	pat-
terns:	asymmetric	disease	predominantly	affecting	the	lower	extremity	
joints	and	symmetric	polyarthritis	with	hand	joint	involvement.	Tumors	
are	often	found	after	the	onset	of	the	arthritis,	and	many	patients	have	a	
preceding	period	of	malaise	or	weight	loss.	The	onset	is	often	acute,	and	
patients	tend	to	be	older	men.	These	features	should	raise	the	question	
of	an	underlying	malignancy	as	the	cause	of	the	arthritis.	In	one	series,	
the	symptoms	resolved	with	successful	therapy	for	the	malignancy	and	
did	not	recur	with	relapse	of	the	malignancy.	Dermatomyositis	has	a	
well-described	association	with	neoplasms	and	may	include	joint	pain	
and	 arthritis.	 Malignancy-associated	 arthritis	 may	 be	 responsive	 to	
NSAIDs	and	to	treatment	of	the	primary	neoplasm.

Immune	 checkpoint	 inhibitors,	 increasingly	 used	 to	 treat	 various	
malignancies,	are	now	well	recognized	to	frequently	elicit	severe	auto-
immune,	 inflammatory,	 organ-targeted	 reactions	 including	 myositis,	
polymyalgia	rheumatica,	and	polyarthritis.

375 Periarticular Disorders  
of the Extremities
Carol A. Langford

Periarticular	 disorders	 are	 common	 musculoskeletal	 abnormalities	
that	 can	 affect	 people	 throughout	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 ages.	 This	 chapter	
discusses	some	of	the	more	common	periarticular	disorders.
 ■ BURSITIS
Bursitis	 is	 inflammation	 of	 a	 bursa,	 which	 is	 a	 thin-walled	 sac	 lined	
with	 synovial	 tissue.	 The	 function	 of	 the	 bursa	 is	 to	 facilitate	 move-
ment	of	tendons	and	muscles	over	bony	prominences.	Excessive	fric-
tional	forces	from	overuse,	trauma,	systemic	disease	(e.g.,	rheumatoid	
arthritis,	 gout),	 or	 infection	 may	 cause	 bursitis.	 Subacromial  bursitis	
(subdeltoid	bursitis)	is	the	most	common	form	of	bursitis.	The	subac-
romial	bursa,	which	is	contiguous	with	the	subdeltoid	bursa,	is	located	
between	the	undersurface	of	the	acromion	and	the	humeral	head	and	is	
covered	by	the	deltoid	muscle.	Bursitis	often	accompanies	rotator	cuff	
tendinitis.	Another	frequently	encountered	form	is	trochanteric bursi-
tis,	which	involves	the	bursa	around	the	insertion	of	the	gluteus	medius	
onto	the	greater	trochanter	of	the	femur.	Patients	experience	pain	over	
the	lateral	aspect	of	the	hip	and	upper	thigh	and	have	tenderness	over	
the	 posterior	 aspect	 of	 the	 greater	 trochanter.	 External	 rotation	 and	
resisted	abduction	of	the	hip	elicit	pain,	as	will	direct	pressure	applied	
to	the	bursa.	Olecranon bursitis	occurs	over	the	posterior	elbow	and,	
when	the	area	is	acutely	inflamed,	infection	or	gout	should	be	excluded	
by	aspirating	the	bursa	and	performing	a	Gram	stain	and	culture	on	the	
fluid	as	well	as	examining	the	fluid	for	urate	crystals.	Achilles bursitis	
involves	 the	 bursa	 located	 above	 the	 insertion	 of	 the	 tendon	 to	 the	
calcaneus	and	results	from	overuse	and	wearing	tight	shoes.	Retrocal-
caneal bursitis	involves	the	bursa	that	is	located	between	the	calcaneus	
and	posterior	surface	of	the	Achilles	tendon.	The	pain	is	experienced	at	
the	back	of	the	heel,	and	swelling	appears	on	the	medial	and/or	lateral	
side	 of	 the	 tendon.	 It	 occurs	 in	 association	 with	 spondyloarthritides,	
rheumatoid	arthritis,	gout,	or	trauma.	Ischial bursitis	affects	the	bursa	
separating	the	gluteus	medius	from	the	ischial	tuberosity	and	develops	
from	prolonged	sitting	and	pivoting	on	hard	surfaces.	Iliopsoas bursitis	
affects	the	bursa	that	lies	between	the	iliopsoas	muscle	and	hip	joint	

and	is	lateral	to	the	femoral	vessels.	Pain	is	experienced	over	this	area	
and	 is	 made	 worse	 by	 hip	 extension	 and	 flexion.	 Anserine  bursitis	
is	 an	 inflammation	 of	 the	 sartorius	 bursa	 located	 over	 the	 medial	
side	 of	 the	 tibia	 just	 below	 the	 knee	 and	 under	 the	 conjoint	 tendon	
and	 is	 manifested	 by	 pain	 on	 climbing	 stairs.	 Tenderness	 is	 present	
over	 the	 insertion	 of	 the	 conjoint	 tendon	 of	 the	 sartorius,	 gracilis,	
and	 semitendinosus.	 Prepatellar  bursitis	 occurs	 in	 the	 bursa	 situated	
between	 the	 patella	 and	 overlying	 skin	 and	 is	 caused	 by	 kneeling	 on	
hard	surfaces.	Gout	or	infection	may	also	occur	at	this	site.	Bursitis	is	
typically	 diagnosed	 by	 history	 and	 physical	 examination,	 but	 visual-
ization	by	ultrasound	may	play	a	useful	role	in	selected	instances	for	
diagnosis	and	directed	guidance	of	glucocorticoid	injection.	Treatment	
of	bursitis	consists	of	prevention	of	any	aggravating	situation,	rest	of	
the	involved	part,	administration	of	a	nonsteroidal	anti-inflammatory	
drug	 (NSAID)	 where	 appropriate	 for	 an	 individual	 patient,	 or	 local	
glucocorticoid	injection.
 ■ ROTATOR CUFF TENDINITIS AND  
IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME
Tendinitis	of	the	rotator	cuff	is	the	major	cause	of	a	painful	shoulder	
and	 is	 currently	 thought	 to	 be	 caused	 by	 inflammation	 of	 the	 ten-
don(s).	The	rotator	cuff	consists	of	the	tendons	of	the	supraspinatus,	
infraspinatus,	subscapularis,	and	teres	minor	muscles,	and	inserts	on	
the	humeral	tuberosities.	Of	the	tendons	forming	the	rotator	cuff,	the	
supraspinatus	tendon	is	the	most	often	affected,	probably	because	of	its	
repeated	impingement	(impingement syndrome)	between	the	humeral	
head	and	the	undersurface	of	the	anterior	third	of	the	acromion	and	
coracoacromial	 ligament	 above	 as	 well	 as	 the	 reduction	 in	 its	 blood	
supply	that	occurs	with	abduction	of	the	arm	(Fig. 375-1).	The	tendon	
of	 the	 infraspinatus	 and	 that	 of	 the	 long	 head	 of	 the	 biceps	 are	 less	
commonly	involved.	Subacromial	bursitis	also	accompanies	this	syn-
drome.	Symptoms	can	appear	without	a	triggering	cause	or	after	injury	
or	overuse,	especially	with	activities	involving	elevation	of	the	arm	with	
some	degree	of	forward	flexion.	Impingement	syndrome	occurs	in	per-
sons	participating	in	baseball,	tennis,	swimming,	or	occupations	that	
require	repeated	elevation	of	the	arm.	Those	aged	>40	years	are	partic-
ularly	susceptible.	Patients	complain	of	a	dull	aching	in	the	shoulder,	
which	may	interfere	with	sleep.	Severe	pain	is	experienced	when	the	
arm	is	actively	abducted	into	an	overhead	position.	The	arc	between	
60°	and	120°	is	especially	painful.	Tenderness	is	present	over	the	lateral	
aspect	 of	 the	 humeral	 head	 just	 below	 the	 acromion.	 NSAIDs,	 local	
glucocorticoid	injection,	and	physical	therapy	may	relieve	symptoms.	
Surgical	decompression	of	the	subacromial	space	may	be	necessary	in	
patients	refractory	to	conservative	treatment.

PART 11Immune-Mediated, Inflammatory, and Rheumatologic DisordersPatients	may	tear	the	supraspinatus	tendon	acutely	by	falling	on	an	
outstretched	 arm	 or	 lifting	 a	 heavy	 object.	 Symptoms	 are	 pain	 along	
with	weakness	of	abduction	and	external	rotation	of	the	shoulder.	Atro-
phy	of	the	supraspinatus	muscles	develops.	The	diagnosis	is	established	
by	 ultrasound,	 magnetic	 resonance	 imaging	 (MRI),	 or	 arthrogram.	
Surgical	 repair	 may	 be	 necessary	 in	 patients	 who	 fail	 to	 respond	 to	
conservative	measures.	In	patients	with	moderate-to-severe	tears	and	
functional	loss,	surgery	is	indicated.

 ■ CALCIFIC TENDINITIS
This	condition	is	characterized	by	deposition	of	calcium	salts,	primar-
ily	hydroxyapatite,	within	a	tendon.	The	exact	mechanism	of	calcifica-
tion	is	not	known	but	may	be	initiated	by	ischemia	or	degeneration	of	
the	tendon.	The	supraspinatus	tendon	is	most	often	affected	because	
it	is	frequently	impinged	on	and	has	a	reduced	blood	supply	when	the	
arm	is	abducted.	The	condition	usually	develops	after	age	40.	Calcifi-
cation	 within	 the	 tendon	 may	 evoke	 acute	 inflammation,	 producing	
sudden	 and	 severe	 pain	 in	 the	 shoulder.	 However,	 it	 may	 be	 asymp-
tomatic	or	not	related	to	the	patient’s	symptoms.	Diagnosis	of	calcific	
tendonitis	 can	 be	 made	 by	 ultrasound	 or	 radiograph.	 Most	 cases	 are	
self-limited	and	respond	to	conservative	therapy	with	physical	therapy	
and/or	NSAIDs.	A	subset	of	patients	is	refractory	and	requires	ultra-
sound-guided	percutaneous	needle	aspiration	and	lavage	or	surgery.

 ■ BICIPITAL TENDINITIS AND RUPTURE
Bicipital	 tendinitis,	 or	 tenosynovitis,	 is	 produced	 by	 friction	 on	 the	
tendon	of	the	long	head	of	the	biceps	as	it	passes	through	the	bicipital	
groove.	When	the	inflammation	is	acute,	patients	experience	anterior	
shoulder	pain	that	radiates	down	the	biceps	into	the	forearm.	Abduc-
tion	 and	 external	 rotation	 of	 the	 arm	 are	 painful	 and	 limited.	 The	
bicipital	groove	is	very	tender	to	palpation.	Pain	may	be	elicited	along	
the	course	of	the	tendon	by	resisting	supination	of	the	forearm	with	the	
elbow	at	90°	(Yergason’s	supination	sign).	Acute	rupture	of	the	tendon	
may	occur	with	vigorous	exercise	of	the	arm	and	is	often	painful.	In	a	
healthy	and	active	patient,	it	should	be	repaired	surgically	as	soon	as	
possible	 after	 the	 rupture	 occurs.	 Rupture	 of	 the	 tendon	 in	 an	 older	
person	may	be	associated	with	little	or	no	pain	and	is	recognized	by	the	
presence	of	persistent	swelling	of	the	biceps	produced	by	the	retraction	
of	the	long	head	of	the	biceps.	Surgery	is	usually	not	necessary	in	this	
setting.

 ■ DE QUERVAIN’S TENOSYNOVITIS
In	 this	 condition,	 inflammation	 involves	 the	 abductor	 pollicis	 lon-
gus	 and	 the	 extensor	 pollicis	 brevis	 as	 these	 tendons	 pass	 through	 a	
fibrous	sheath	at	the	radial	styloid	process.	The	usual	cause	is	repetitive	
twisting	of	the	wrist.	It	may	occur	in	pregnancy,	and	it	also	occurs	in	
mothers	who	hold	their	babies	with	the	thumb	outstretched.	Patients	
experience	pain	on	grasping	with	their	thumb,	such	as	with	pinching.	
Swelling	and	tenderness	are	often	present	over	the	radial	styloid	pro-
cess.	 The	 Finkelstein	 sign	 is	 positive,	 which	 is	 elicited	 by	 having	 the	
patient	place	the	thumb	in	the	palm	and	close	the	fingers	over	it.	The	
wrist	is	then	ulnarly	deviated,	resulting	in	pain	over	the	involved	ten-
don	sheath	in	the	area	of	the	radial	styloid.	Treatment	consists	initially	
of	 splinting	 the	 wrist	 and	 an	 NSAID.	 When	 severe	 or	 refractory	 to	
conservative	treatment,	glucocorticoid	injections	can	be	very	effective.

 ■ PATELLAR TENDINITIS
Tendinitis	involves	the	patellar	tendon	at	its	attachment	to	the	lower	
pole	of	the	patella.	Patients	may	experience	pain	when	jumping	during	
sports,	going	up	stairs,	or	doing	deep	knee	squats.	Tenderness	is	noted	
on	examination	over	the	lower	pole	of	the	patella.	Treatment	consists	
of	rest,	icing,	and	NSAIDs,	followed	by	strengthening	and	increasing	
flexibility.

 ■ DRUG-INDUCED TENDINOPATHIES
With	 the	 broadening	 range	 of	 available	 pharmacologic	 agents,	 the	
potential	 for	 drug-induced	 tendinopathies	 has	 become	 increasingly	
recognized.	 The	 drug	 classes	 most	 associated	 with	 tendinopathies	
include	quinolones,	glucocorticoids,	aromatase	inhibitors,	and	statins.	

Although	any	tendon	can	be	affected,	the	tendons	of	the	lower	extrem-
ities	 are	 most	 often	 impacted,	 particularly	 the	 Achilles	 tendon.	 The	
pathophysiologic	 mechanisms	 responsible	 for	 drug-induced	 tend-
inopathies	 remain	 unknown.	 Presenting	 features	 include	 pain	 and	
potentially	swelling	over	the	tendon,	although	some	patients	may	first	
present	with	tendon	rupture.	Ultrasound	and	MRI	can	provide	infor-
mation	on	tendon	structure	and	integrity	in	support	of	the	diagnosis.	
When	 suspected,	 the	 potential	 agent	 should	 be	 withdrawn	 and	 not	
reintroduced	where	possible.	Tendon	ruptures	may	require	surgery.

 ■ ILIOTIBIAL BAND SYNDROME
The	iliotibial	band	is	a	thick	connective	tissue	that	runs	from	the	ilium	
to	the	fibula.	Patients	with	iliotibial	band	syndrome	most	commonly	
present	with	aching	or	burning	pain	at	the	site	where	the	band	courses	
over	 the	 lateral	 femoral	 condyle	 of	 the	 knee;	 pain	 may	 also	 radiate	
up	 the	 thigh,	 toward	 the	 hip.	 Predisposing	 factors	 for	 iliotibial	 band	
syndrome	 include	 a	 varus	 alignment	 of	 the	 knee,	 excessive	 running	
distance,	poorly	fitted	shoes,	or	continuous	running	on	uneven	terrain.	
Treatment	consists	of	rest,	NSAIDs,	physical	therapy,	and	addressing	
risk	factors	such	as	shoes	and	running	surface.	Glucocorticoid	injec-
tion	into	the	area	of	tenderness	can	provide	relief,	but	running	must	be	
avoided	for	at	least	2	weeks	after	the	injection.	Surgical	release	of	the	
iliotibial	band	has	been	helpful	in	rare	patients	for	whom	conservative	
treatment	has	failed.

 ■ ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS
Often	referred	to	as	“frozen	shoulder,”	adhesive	capsulitis	is	character-
ized	by	pain	and	restricted	movement	of	the	shoulder,	usually	in	the	
absence	 of	 intrinsic	 shoulder	 disease.	 Adhesive	 capsulitis	 most	 often	
develops	in	the	setting	of	reduced	arm	mobility	following	bursitis	or	
tendinitis	of	the	shoulder,	fractures,	or	recovery	from	surgery	but	can	
occur	without	an	antecedent	event.	It	has	been	associated	with	systemic	
disorders	such	as	diabetes	mellitus,	chronic	pulmonary	disease,	myo-
cardial	 infarction,	 and	 thyroid	 disease.	 Pathologically,	 the	 capsule	 of	
the	shoulder	is	thickened,	and	a	mild	chronic	inflammatory	infiltrate	
and	fibrosis	may	be	present.

Adhesive	 capsulitis	 occurs	 more	 commonly	 in	 women	 aged		
>50	 years.	 Pain	 and	 stiffness	 usually	 develop	 gradually	 but	 progress	
rapidly	 in	 some	 patients.	 Night	 pain	 is	 often	 present	 in	 the	 affected	
shoulder,	 and	 pain	 may	 interfere	 with	 sleep.	 The	 shoulder	 is	 tender	
to	 palpation,	 and	 both	 active	 and	 passive	 movements	 are	 restricted.	
Radiographs	 of	 the	 shoulder	 show	 osteopenia.	 The	 diagnosis	 is	 typi-
cally	made	by	physical	examination	but	can	be	confirmed	if	necessary	
by	 arthrography,	 in	 that	 only	 a	 limited	 amount	 of	 contrast	 material,	
usually	<15	mL,	can	be	injected	under	pressure	into	the	shoulder	joint.
In	 most	 patients,	 the	 condition	 improves	 spontaneously	 1–3	 years	
after	onset.	While	pain	usually	improves,	many	patients	are	left	with	
some	 limitation	 of	 shoulder	 motion.	 Early	 mobilization	 of	 the	 arm	
following	 an	 injury	 to	 the	 shoulder	 may	 prevent	 the	 development	 of	
this	disease.	Physical	therapy	provides	the	foundation	of	treatment	for	
adhesive	 capsulitis.	 Local	 injections	 of	 glucocorticoids	 and	 NSAIDs	
may	 also	 provide	 relief	 of	 symptoms.	 Slow	 but	 forceful	 injection	 of	
contrast	 material	 into	 the	 joint	 may	 lyse	 adhesions	 and	 stretch	 the	
capsule,	 resulting	 in	 improvement	 of	 shoulder	 motion.	 Manipulation	
under	anesthesia	may	be	helpful	in	some	patients.

 ■ LATERAL EPICONDYLITIS
Lateral	epicondylitis,	also	known	as	tennis	elbow,	is	a	painful	condition	
involving	the	soft	tissue	over	the	lateral	aspect	of	the	elbow.	The	pain	
originates	at	or	near	the	site	of	attachment	of	the	common	extensors	
to	 the	 lateral	 epicondyle	 and	 may	 radiate	 into	 the	 forearm	 and	 dor-
sum	of	the	wrist.	The	pain	usually	appears	after	work	or	recreational	
activities	involving	repeated	motions	of	wrist	extension	and	supination	
against	resistance.	Most	patients	with	this	disorder	injure	themselves	
in	 activities	 other	 than	 tennis,	 such	 as	 pulling	 weeds,	 carrying	 suit-
cases	or	briefcases,	or	using	a	screwdriver.	The	injury	in	tennis	usually	
occurs	when	hitting	a	backhand	with	the	elbow	flexed.	Shaking	hands	
and	opening	doors	can	reproduce	the	pain.	Striking	the	lateral	elbow	
against	a	solid	object	may	also	induce	pain.

The	 treatment	 is	 usually	 rest	 along	 with	 administration	 of	 an	
NSAID.	Ultrasound,	icing,	and	friction	massage	may	also	help	relieve	
pain.	 When	 pain	 is	 severe,	 the	 elbow	 is	 placed	 in	 a	 sling	 or	 splinted	
at	90°	of	flexion.	When	the	pain	is	acute	and	well	localized,	injection	
of	a	glucocorticoid	using	a	small-gauge	needle	may	be	effective.	Fol-
lowing	injection,	the	patient	should	be	advised	to	rest	the	arm	for	at	
least	 1	 month	 and	 avoid	 activities	 that	 would	 aggravate	 the	 elbow.	
Once	symptoms	have	subsided,	the	patient	should	begin	rehabilitation	
to	 strengthen	 and	 increase	 flexibility	 of	 the	 extensor	 muscles	 before	
resuming	physical	activity	involving	the	arm.	A	forearm	band	placed	
2.5–5.0	cm	(1–2	in.)	below	the	elbow	may	help	to	reduce	tension	on	
the	 extensor	 muscles	 at	 their	 attachment	 to	 the	 lateral	 epicondyle.	
The	 patient	 should	 be	 advised	 to	 restrict	 activities	 requiring	 forcible	
extension	and	supination	of	the	wrist.	Improvement	may	take	several	
months.	The	patient	may	continue	to	experience	mild	pain	but,	with	
care,	 can	 usually	 avoid	 the	 return	 of	 debilitating	 pain.	 Occasionally,	
surgical	release	of	the	extensor	aponeurosis	may	be	necessary.
 ■ MEDIAL EPICONDYLITIS
Medial	epicondylitis	is	an	overuse	syndrome	resulting	in	pain	over	the	
medial	side	of	the	elbow	with	radiation	into	the	forearm.	The	cause	of	
this	syndrome	is	considered	to	be	repetitive	resisted	motions	of	wrist	
flexion	and	pronation,	which	lead	to	microtears	and	granulation	tissue	
at	the	origin	of	the	pronator	teres	and	forearm	flexors,	particularly	the	
flexor	carpi	radialis.	This	overuse	syndrome	is	usually	seen	in	patients	
aged	>35	years	and	is	much	less	common	than	lateral	epicondylitis.	It	
occurs	most	often	in	work-related	repetitive	activities	and	also	occurs	
with	 recreational	 activities	 such	 as	 swinging	 a	 golf	 club	 or	 throwing	
a	baseball.	On	physical	examination,	there	is	tenderness	just	distal	to	
the	medial	epicondyle	over	the	origin	of	the	forearm	flexors.	Pain	can	
be	reproduced	by	resisting	wrist	flexion	and	pronation	with	the	elbow	
extended.	Radiographs	are	usually	normal.	The	differential	diagnosis	
of	patients	with	medial	elbow	symptoms	includes	tears	of	the	pronator	
teres,	acute	medial	collateral	ligament	tear,	and	medial	collateral	liga-
ment	instability.	Ulnar	neuritis	has	been	found	in	25–50%	of	patients	
with	 medial	 epicondylitis	 and	 is	 associated	 with	 tenderness	 over	 the	
ulnar	nerve	at	the	elbow	as	well	as	hypesthesia	and	paresthesia	on	the	
ulnar	side	of	the	hand.

The	initial	treatment	of	medial	epicondylitis	is	conservative,	involv-
ing	 rest,	 NSAIDs,	 friction	 massage,	 ultrasound,	 and	 icing.	 Some	
patients	 may	 require	 splinting.	 Injections	 of	 glucocorticoids	 at	 the	
painful	site	may	also	be	effective.	Patients	should	be	instructed	to	rest	
for	at	least	1	month.	Also,	patients	should	start	physical	therapy	once	
the	pain	has	subsided.	In	patients	with	chronic	debilitating	medial	epi-
condylitis	that	remains	unresponsive	after	at	least	a	year	of	treatment,	
surgical	release	of	the	flexor	muscle	at	its	origin	may	be	necessary	and	
is	often	successful.

 ■ PLANTAR FASCIITIS
Plantar	fasciitis	is	a	common	cause	of	foot	pain	in	adults,	with	the	peak	
incidence	occurring	in	people	between	the	ages	of	40	and	60	years.	The	
pain	originates	at	or	near	the	site	of	the	plantar	fascia	attachment	to	the	
medial	tuberosity	of	the	calcaneus.	Several	factors	that	increase	the	risk	
of	developing	plantar	fasciitis	include	obesity,	pes	planus	(flat	foot	or	
absence	of	the	foot	arch	when	standing),	pes	cavus	(high-arched	foot),	
limited	dorsiflexion	of	the	ankle,	prolonged	standing,	walking	on	hard	
surfaces,	and	faulty	shoes.	In	runners,	excessive	running	and	a	change	
to	a	harder	running	surface	may	precipitate	plantar	fasciitis.

The	diagnosis	of	plantar	fasciitis	can	usually	be	made	on	the	basis	
of	history	and	physical	examination	alone.	Patients	experience	severe	
pain	with	the	first	steps	on	arising	in	the	morning	or	following	inac-
tivity	 during	 the	 day.	 The	 pain	 usually	 lessens	 with	 weight-bearing	
activity	only	to	increase	with	continued	activity.	Pain	is	made	worse	on	
walking	barefoot	or	up	stairs.	On	examination,	maximal	tenderness	is	
elicited	on	palpation	over	the	inferior	heel	corresponding	to	the	site	of	
attachment	of	the	plantar	fascia.

Imaging	studies	may	be	indicated	when	the	diagnosis	is	not	clear.	
Plain	radiographs	may	show	heel	spurs,	which	are	of	little	diagnostic	
significance.	 Ultrasonography	 in	 plantar	 fasciitis	 can	 demonstrate	
thickening	 of	 the	 fascia	 and	 diffuse	 hypoechogenicity,	 indicating	
edema	at	the	attachment	of	the	plantar	fascia	to	the	calcaneus.	MRI	is	
a	sensitive	method	for	detecting	plantar	fasciitis,	but	it	is	usually	not	
required	for	establishing	the	diagnosis.

Resolution	 of	 symptoms	 occurs	 within	 12	 months	 in	 >80%	 of	
patients	 with	 plantar	 fasciitis.	 Initial	 treatment	 consists	 of	 ice,	 heat,	
massage,	stretching,	and	eliminating	inciting	activities.	Orthotics	pro-
vide	medial	arch	support	and	can	be	effective.	Some	patients	may	ben-
efit	from	foot	strapping	or	taping	or	by	wearing	a	night	splint	designed	
to	keep	the	ankle	in	a	neutral	position.	A	short	course	of	NSAIDs	can	
be	given	to	patients	when	the	benefits	outweigh	the	risks.	Local	glu-
cocorticoid	injections	have	also	been	shown	to	be	efficacious	but	may	
carry	 an	 increased	 risk	 for	 plantar	 fascia	 rupture.	 Plantar	 fasciotomy	
is	reserved	for	those	patients	who	have	failed	to	improve	after	at	least	
6–12	months	of	conservative	treatment.
