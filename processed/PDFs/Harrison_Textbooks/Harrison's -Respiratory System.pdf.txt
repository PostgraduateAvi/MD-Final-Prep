Section 1  Diagnosis of Respiratory 
Disorders

284 Approach to the Patient 
with Disease of the 
Respiratory System
Bruce D. Levy

The majority of diseases of the respiratory system present with cough 
and/or dyspnea and fall into one of three major categories: (1) obstruc-
tive; (2) restrictive; and (3) vascular diseases. Obstructive pathophys-
iology  is  most  common  and  primarily  results  from  airway  diseases, 
such  as  asthma,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD), 
bronchiectasis,  and  bronchiolitis.  Diseases  resulting  in  restrictive 
pathophysiology  include  parenchymal  lung  diseases,  abnormalities 
of the chest wall and pleura, and neuromuscular disease. Pulmonary 
embolism,  pulmonary  hypertension,  and  pulmonary  venoocclusive 
disease  are  examples  of  disorders  of  the  pulmonary  vasculature. 
Although many specific diseases fall into these major categories, both 
infective and neoplastic processes can affect the respiratory system and 
result in myriad pathologic findings, including those listed in the three 
categories above (Table 284-1).

Disorders  can  also  be  grouped  according  to  gas  exchange  abnor-
malities, including hypoxemia, hypercarbia, or combined impairment; 
however, many respiratory disorders do not manifest as gas exchange 
abnormalities.

As with the evaluation of most patients, the approach to a patient 
with  a  respiratory  system  disorder  begins  with  a  thorough  history

and a focused physical examination. Many patients will subsequently 
undergo pulmonary function testing, chest imaging, blood and sputum 
analysis, a variety of serologic or microbiologic studies, and diagnostic 
procedures, such as bronchoscopy. This stepwise approach is discussed 
in detail below.

 ■ HISTORY
Dyspnea  and  Cough  The  cardinal  symptoms  of  respiratory  dis-
ease are dyspnea and cough (Chaps. 37 and 38). Dyspnea has many 
causes, some of which are not predominantly due to lung pathology. 
The words a patient uses to describe shortness of breath can suggest 
certain  etiologies  for  dyspnea.  Patients  with  obstructive  lung  disease 
often complain of “chest tightness” or “inability to get a deep breath,” 
whereas patients with congestive heart failure more commonly report 
“air hunger” or a sense of suffocation.

The  tempo  of  onset  and  the  duration  of  a  patient’s  dyspnea  are 
likewise helpful in determining the etiology. Acute shortness of breath 
is  usually  associated  with  sudden  physiologic  changes,  such  as  acute 
airway  narrowing  (e.g.,  laryngeal  edema,  bronchospasm,  or  mucus 
plugging),  acute  hypoxemia  (e.g.,  pulmonary  edema,  pneumonia,  or 
pulmonary  embolism),  or  sudden  changes  in  the  work  of  breathing 
(e.g., pneumothorax). Patients with COPD and idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF) experience a gradual progression of dyspnea on exertion, 
punctuated by acute exacerbations of shortness of breath. In contrast, 
most asthmatics do not have daily symptoms, but experience intermit-
tent  episodes  of  dyspnea,  cough,  and  chest  tightness  that  are  usually 
associated  with  specific  triggers,  such  as  an  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection or exposure to allergens.

Specific questioning should focus on factors that incite dyspnea as 
well as on any intervention that helps resolve the patient’s shortness of 
breath. Asthma is commonly exacerbated by specific triggers, although 
this can also be true of COPD. Many patients with lung disease report 
dyspnea on exertion. Determining the degree of activity that results in 
shortness of breath gives the clinician a gauge of the patient’s degree of 
disability. Many patients adapt their level of activity to accommodate 
progressive limitation. For this reason, it is important, particularly in 
older patients, to delineate the activities in which they engage and how 
these activities have changed over time. Dyspnea on exertion is often 
an early symptom of underlying lung or heart disease and warrants a 
thorough evaluation.

For  cough,  the  clinician  should  inquire  about  the  duration  of  the 
cough, whether or not it is associated with sputum production, and any 
specific  triggers  that  induce  it.  Acute  cough  productive  of  phlegm  is 
often a symptom of infection of the respiratory system, including pro-
cesses affecting the upper airway (e.g., sinusitis, tracheitis), the lower 
airways  (e.g.,  bronchitis,  bronchiectasis),  and  the  lung  parenchyma 
(e.g.,  pneumonia).  Both  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  sputum, 
including  whether  it  is  blood-streaked  or  frankly  bloody,  should  be 
determined.  Hemoptysis  warrants  urgent  evaluation  as  delineated  in 
Chap. 39.

Chronic cough (defined as that persisting for >8 weeks) is commonly 
associated with obstructive lung diseases, particularly asthma, COPD, 
and chronic bronchiectasis, as well as “nonrespiratory” diseases, such 
as  gastroesophageal  reflux  and  postnasal  drip.  Diffuse  parenchymal 
lung  diseases,  including  IPF,  frequently  present  as  a  persistent,  non-
productive cough. All causes of cough are not respiratory in origin, and 
assessment  should  encompass  a  broad  differential,  including  cardiac 
and gastrointestinal diseases as well as psychogenic causes.

Additional  Symptoms  Patients  with  respiratory  disease  may 
report  wheezing,  which  is  suggestive  of  airways  disease,  particularly 
asthma.  Hemoptysis  can  be  a  symptom  of  a  variety  of  lung  diseases, 
including infections of the respiratory tract, bronchogenic carcinoma, 
and pulmonary embolism. In addition, chest pain or discomfort can be 
respiratory in origin. As the lung parenchyma is not innervated with 

HPIM21e_Part7_p2131-p2216.indd   2131

2132 pain fibers, pain in the chest from respiratory disorders usually results 
from  either  diseases  of  the  parietal  pleura  (e.g.,  pneumothorax)  or 
pulmonary vascular diseases (e.g., pulmonary hypertension). As many 
diseases of the lung can result in strain on the right side of the heart, 
patients may also present with symptoms of cor pulmonale, including 
abdominal bloating or distention and pedal edema (Chap. 257).

Additional  History  A  thorough  social  history  is  an  essential 
component of the evaluation of patients with respiratory disease. All 
patients should be asked about current or previous cigarette smoking, 
as  this  exposure  is  associated  with  many  diseases  of  the  respiratory 
system,  including  COPD,  bronchogenic  lung  cancer,  and  select  par-
enchymal  lung  diseases  (e.g.,  desquamative  interstitial  pneumonitis 
and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis). For most of these dis-
orders, increased cigarette smoke exposure (i.e., cigarette pack-years) 
increases  the  risk  of  disease.  E-cigarette  or  vaping  use  can  lead  to 
acute or subacute lung injury (i.e., E-cigarette or vaping use-associated 
lung injury [EVALI]). Secondhand smoke also increases risk for some 
respiratory disorders, so patients should also be asked about parents, 
spouses,  or  housemates  who  smoke.  Possible  inhalational  exposures 
at work (e.g., asbestos, silica) or home (e.g., wood smoke, excrement 
from pet birds) should be explored (Chap. 289). Travel predisposes to 
certain  infections  of  the  respiratory  tract,  most  notably  tuberculosis. 
Potential exposure to fungi is increased in specific geographic regions 
or  climates  (e.g.,  Histoplasma  capsulatum),  so  exposures  to  these 
regions should be determined.

Associated symptoms of fever and chills should raise the suspicion 
of infective etiologies, both pulmonary and systemic. A comprehensive 
review of systems may suggest rheumatologic or autoimmune disease 
presenting  with  respiratory  tract  manifestations.  Questions  should 
focus on joint pain or swelling, rashes, dry eyes, dry mouth, or consti-
tutional symptoms. In addition, carcinomas from a variety of primary 
sources commonly metastasize to the lung and cause respiratory symp-
toms. Finally, therapy for other conditions, including both irradiation 
and medications, can result in diseases of the chest.

Physical  Examination  The  clinician’s  suspicion  of  respiratory 
disease often begins with the patient’s vital signs. The respiratory rate 
is informative, whether elevated (tachypnea) or depressed (hypopnea). 
In addition, pulse oximetry should be measured, as many patients with 
respiratory disease have hypoxemia, either at rest or with exertion.

The first step of the physical examination is inspection. Patients with 
respiratory disease may be in distress and using accessory muscles of 
respiration  to  breathe.  Severe  kyphoscoliosis  can  result  in  restrictive 
pathophysiology.  Inability  to  complete  a  sentence  in  conversation  is 
generally a sign of severe impairment and should result in an expedited 
evaluation of the patient.

Percussion  of  the  chest  is  used  to  establish  diaphragm  excursion 
and lung size. In the setting of decreased breath sounds, percussion is 
used to distinguish between pleural effusions (dull to percussion) and 
pneumothorax (hyper-resonant note).

The role of palpation is limited in the respiratory examination. Pal-
pation can demonstrate subcutaneous air in the setting of barotrauma. 
It can also be used as an adjunctive assessment to determine whether 
an area of decreased breath sounds is due to consolidation (increased 
tactile fremitus) or a pleural effusion (decreased tactile fremitus). To 
detect  unilateral  disorders  of  ventilation,  the  symmetry  and  degree 
of chest wall expansion can be assessed during a deep inspiration by 
placing one’s thumbs together at the midline over the lower posterior 
chest while grasping the lateral rib cage.

The majority of the manifestations of respiratory disease present as 
abnormalities of auscultation. Wheezes are a manifestation of airway 
obstruction.  While  most  commonly  a  sign  of  asthma,  peribronchial 
edema in the setting of congestive heart failure can also result in dif-
fuse wheezes, as can any other process that causes narrowing of small 
airways. Wheezes can be polyphonic, involving multiple different size 
airways (e.g., asthma), or monophonic, involving one size airway (e.g., 
bronchogenic carcinoma). For these reasons, clinicians must take care 
not to attribute all wheezing to asthma.

Rhonchi  are  a  manifestation  of  obstruction  of  medium-sized  air-
ways,  most  often  with  secretions.  In  the  acute  setting,  this  manifes-
tation may be a sign of viral or bacterial bronchitis. Chronic rhonchi 
suggest bronchiectasis or COPD. In contrast to expiratory wheezes and 
rhonchi,  stridor  is  a  high-pitched,  focal  inspiratory  wheeze,  usually 
heard over the neck as a manifestation of upper airway obstruction.

Crackles,  or  rales,  are  commonly  a  sign  of  alveolar  disease.  Pro-
cesses that fill the alveoli with fluid may result in crackles, including 
pulmonary  edema  and  pneumonia.  Crackles  in  pulmonary  edema 
are generally more prominent at the bases. Interestingly, diseases that 
result in fibrosis of the interstitium (e.g., IPF) also result in crackles that 
sound like Velcro being ripped apart. Although some clinicians make 
a distinction between “wet” and “dry” crackles, this distinction has not 
been  shown  to  be  a  reliable  way  to  differentiate  among  etiologies  of 
respiratory disease.

One way to help distinguish between crackles associated with alve-
olar fluid and those associated with interstitial fibrosis is to assess for 
egophony. Egophony is the auscultation of the sound “AH” instead of 
“EEE” when a patient phonates “EEE.” This change in note is due to 
abnormal sound transmission through consolidated parenchyma and 
is  present  in  pneumonia  but  not  in  IPF.  Similarly,  areas  of  alveolar 
filling  have  increased  whispered  pectoriloquy  as  well  as  transmission 
of  larger-airway  sounds  (i.e.,  bronchial  breath  sounds  in  a  lung  zone 
where vesicular breath sounds are expected).

The lack or diminution of breath sounds can also help determine the 
etiology of respiratory disease. Patients with emphysema often have a 
quiet chest with diffusely decreased breath sounds. A pneumothorax 
or pleural effusion may present with an area of absent breath sounds.

Other Systems  Pedal  edema,  if  symmetric,  may  suggest  cor  pul-
monale; if asymmetric, it may be due to deep venous thrombosis and 
associated  pulmonary  embolism.  Jugular  venous  distention  may  also 
be a sign of volume overload associated with right heart failure. Pulsus 
paradoxus is an ominous sign in a patient with obstructive lung dis-
ease, as it is associated with significant negative intrathoracic (pleural) 
pressures required for ventilation and impending respiratory failure.

As stated earlier, rheumatologic disease may manifest primarily as 
lung disease. Owing to this association, particular attention should be 
paid  to  joint  and  skin  examination.  Clubbing  can  be  found  in  many 
lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, IPF, and lung cancer. Cyanosis 
is seen in hypoxemic respiratory disorders that result in >5 g of deox-
ygenated hemoglobin/dL.

 ■ DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
The  sequence  of  studies  is  dictated  by  the  clinician’s  differential 
diagnosis,  as  determined  by  the  history  and  physical  examination. 
Acute  respiratory  symptoms  are  often  evaluated  with  multiple  tests 
performed at the same time in order to diagnose any life-threatening 
diseases rapidly (e.g., pulmonary embolism or multilobar pneumonia). 
In  contrast,  chronic  dyspnea  and  cough  can  be  evaluated  in  a  more 
protracted, stepwise fashion.

Pulmonary  Function  Testing  (See  also  Chap.  286)  The 
initial  pulmonary  function  test  obtained  is  spirometry.  This  study  is 
an  effort-dependent  test  used  to  assess  for  obstructive  pathophysiol-
ogy  as  seen  in  asthma,  COPD,  and  bronchiectasis  (Table  284-1).  A  
diminished-forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  second  (FEV1)/forced 
vital  capacity  (FVC)  (often  defined  as  <70%)  is  diagnostic  of  airflow 
obstruction.  In  addition  to  measuring  FEV1  and  FVC,  the  clinician 
should examine the flow-volume loop (which is less effort-dependent). 
A plateau of the inspiratory and expiratory curves suggests large-airway 
obstruction in extrathoracic and intrathoracic locations, respectively.

Spirometry  with  symmetric  decreases  in  FEV1  and  FVC  warrants 
further  testing,  including  measurement  of  lung  volumes  and  the  dif-
fusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DlCO). A total lung 
capacity <80% of the patient’s predicted value defines restrictive patho-
physiology.  Restriction  can  result  from  parenchymal  disease,  neuro-
muscular  weakness,  or  chest  wall  or  pleural  diseases  (Table  284-1).  
Restriction  with  impaired  gas  exchange,  as  indicated  by  a  decreased

DlCO,  suggests  parenchymal  lung  disease.  Additional  testing,  such  as 
measurements  of  maximal  inspiratory  and  expiratory  pressures,  can 
help  diagnose  neuromuscular  weakness.  Normal  spirometry,  normal 
lung  volumes,  and  a  low  DlCO  should  prompt  further  evaluation  for 
pulmonary vascular disease.

Arterial  blood  gas  testing  is  often  helpful  in  assessing  respiratory 
disease. Hypoxemia, while usually apparent with pulse oximetry, can 
be further evaluated with the measurement of arterial PO2 and the cal-
culation of an alveolar gas and arterial blood oxygen tension difference 
([A–a]DO2).  Patients  with  diseases  that  cause  ventilation-perfusion 
mismatch  or  shunt  physiology  have  an  increased  (A–a)DO2  at  rest. 
Arterial blood gas testing also allows the measurement of arterial Pco2. 
Hypercarbia can accompany disorders of ventilation, as seen in severe 
airway obstruction (e.g., COPD) or progressive restrictive physiology.

Chest Imaging (See Chap. A12)  Most  patients  with  disease  of 
the  respiratory  system  undergo  imaging  of  the  chest  as  part  of  the 
initial  evaluation.  Clinicians  should  generally  begin  with  ultrasound 
of the chest or a plain chest radiograph, preferably posterior-anterior 
and  lateral  films.  Ultrasound  is  often  readily  available  and  can  help 
rapidly  diagnose  pneumothorax,  pleural  effusion,  and  consolidation 
of lung parenchyma. Chest radiographs give additional detail and can 
reveal findings including opacities of the parenchyma, blunting of the 
costophrenic  angles,  mass  lesions,  and  volume  loss.  Of  note,  many 
diseases of the respiratory system, particularly those of the airways and 
pulmonary vasculature, are associated with a normal chest radiograph.
CT  scan  of  the  chest  can  also  be  useful  to  delineate  parenchymal 
processes, pleural disease, masses or nodules, and large airways. If the 
test  includes  administration  of  intravenous  contrast,  the  pulmonary 
vasculature can be assessed with particular utility for determination of 
pulmonary  emboli.  Intravenous  contrast  also  allows  lymph  nodes  to 
be examined in greater detail. When coupled with positron emission 
tomography (PET), lesions of the chest can be assessed for metabolic 
activity, helping differentiate between malignancy and scar.

 ■ FURTHER STUDIES
Depending on the clinician’s suspicion, a variety of other studies may 
be done. Concern about large-airway lesions may warrant bronchos-
copy.  This  procedure  may  also  be  used  to  sample  the  alveolar  space 
with  bronchoalveolar  lavage  or  to  obtain  nonsurgical  lung  biopsies. 
Blood testing may include assessment for hypercoagulable states in the 
setting of pulmonary vascular disease, serologic testing for infectious 
or  rheumatologic  disease,  or  assessment  of  inflammatory  markers  or 
leukocyte  counts  (e.g.,  eosinophils).  Genetic  testing  is  increasingly 
used  for  heritable  lung  diseases  such  as  cystic  fibrosis.  Sputum  eval-
uation for malignant cells or microorganisms may be appropriate. An 
echocardiogram to assess right- and left-sided heart function is often 
obtained. Finally, at times, a surgical lung biopsy is needed to diagnose 
certain diseases of the respiratory system. All of these studies will be 
guided  by  the  preceding  history,  physical  examination,  pulmonary 
function testing, and chest imaging.

285 Disturbances of  

Respiratory Function
Edward T. Naureckas, Julian Solway

The primary functions of the respiratory system—to oxygenate blood 
and eliminate carbon dioxide—require virtual contact between blood 
and  fresh  air,  which  facilitates  diffusion  of  respiratory  gases  between 
blood  and  gas.  This  process  occurs  in  the  lung  alveoli,  where  blood 
flowing through alveolar wall capillaries is separated from alveolar gas 
by an extremely thin membrane of flattened endothelial and epithelial 
cells, across which respiratory gases diffuse and equilibrate. Blood flow 
through the lung is unidirectional via a continuous vascular path along 
which  venous  blood  absorbs  oxygen  from  and  loses  CO2  to  inspired 
gas. The path for airflow, in contrast, reaches a dead end at the alveolar 
walls;  thus,  the  alveolar  space  must  be  ventilated  tidally,  with  inflow 
of fresh gas and outflow of alveolar gas alternating periodically at the 
respiratory  rate  (RR).  To  provide  an  enormous  alveolar  surface  area 
(typically  70  m2)  for  blood-gas  diffusion  within  the  modest  volume 
of a thoracic cavity (typically 7 L), nature has distributed both blood 
flow and ventilation among millions of tiny alveoli through multigen-
erational branching of both pulmonary arteries and bronchial airways. 
Ideally, for the lung to be most efficient in exchanging gas, the fresh 
gas  ventilation  of  a  given  alveolus  must  be  matched  to  its  perfusion. 
However, as a consequence of variations in tube lengths and calibers 
along  these  pathways  as  well  as  the  effects  of  gravity,  tidal  pressure 
fluctuations, and anatomic constraints from the chest wall, the alveoli 
vary in their relative ventilations and perfusions even in health.

For  the  respiratory  system  to  succeed  in  oxygenating  blood  and 
eliminating  CO2,  it  must  be  able  to  ventilate  the  lung  tidally  and  
thus  to  freshen  alveolar  gas;  it  must  provide  for  perfusion  of  the 
individual alveolus in a manner proportional to its ventilation; and it 
must  allow  adequate  diffusion  of  respiratory  gases  between  alveolar 
gas  and  capillary  blood.  Furthermore,  it  must  accommodate  several-
fold  increases  in  the  demand  for  oxygen  uptake  or  CO2  elimination 
imposed  by  metabolic  needs  or  acid-base  derangement.  Given  these 
multiple  requirements  for  normal  operation,  it  is  not  surprising  that 
many  diseases  disturb  respiratory  function.  This  chapter  considers 
in  some  detail  the  physiologic  determinants  of  lung  ventilation  and 
perfusion, elucidates how the matching distributions of these processes 
and rapid gas diffusion allow normal gas exchange, and discusses how 
common diseases derange these normal functions, thereby impairing 
gas exchange—or at least increasing the work required by the respira-
tory muscles or heart to maintain adequate respiratory function.

 ■ VENTILATION
It is useful to conceptualize the respiratory system as three indepen-
dently  functioning  components:  the  lung,  including  its  airways;  the 
neuromuscular system; and the chest wall, which includes everything 
that  is  not  lung  or  active  neuromuscular  system.  Accordingly,  the 
mass  of  the  respiratory  muscles  is  part  of  the  chest  wall,  while  the 
force  these  muscles  generate  is  part  of  the  neuromuscular  system;  
the abdomen (especially an obese abdomen) and the heart (especially 
an enlarged heart) are, for these purposes, part of the chest wall. Each 
of these three components has mechanical properties that relate to its 
enclosed  volume  (or—in  the  case  of  the  neuromuscular  system—the 
respiratory system volume at which it is operating) and to the rate of 
change of its volume (i.e., flow). The work of breathing required of the 
neuromuscular system is the sum of the work due to volume-related 
mechanical  properties  and  the  work  from  flow-related  mechanical 
properties required to move air throughout the airways to create this 
volume change.

tory system. Because of both surface tension at the air-liquid interface

between alveolar wall lining fluid and alveolar gas and elastic recoil of 
the lung tissue itself, the lung requires a positive transmural pressure 
difference between alveolar gas and its pleural surface to stay inflated; 
this  difference  is  called  the  elastic  recoil  pressure  of  the  lung,  and  it 
increases with lung volume. The lung becomes rather stiff at high vol-
umes, so that relatively small volume changes are accompanied by large 
changes in transpulmonary pressure; in contrast, the lung is compliant 
at  lower  volumes,  including  those  at  which  tidal  breathing  normally 
occurs. At zero inflation pressure, even normal lungs retain some air 
in the alveoli. Because the small peripheral airways are tethered open 
by  outward  radial  pull  from  inflated  lung  parenchyma  attached  to 
adventitia, as the lung deflates during exhalation, those small airways 
are pulled open progressively less, and eventually close, trapping some 
gas in the alveoli. This effect can be exaggerated with age and especially 
with obstructive airway diseases, resulting in gas trapping at quite large 
lung volumes.

The  elastic  behavior  of  the  passive  chest  wall  (i.e.,  in  the  absence 
of  neuromuscular  activation)  differs  markedly  from  that  of  the  lung. 
Whereas the lung tends toward full deflation with no distending (trans-
mural) pressure, the chest wall encloses a large volume when pleural 
pressure equals body surface (atmospheric) pressure. Furthermore, the 
chest  wall  is  compliant  at  high  enclosed  volumes,  readily  expanding 
even further in response to increases in transmural pressure. The chest 
wall  also  remains  compliant  at  small  negative  transmural  pressures 
(i.e., when pleural pressure falls slightly below atmospheric pressure), 
but as the volume enclosed by the chest wall becomes quite small in 
response to large negative transmural pressures, the passive chest wall 
becomes stiff due to squeezing together of ribs and intercostal muscles, 
diaphragm stretch, displacement of abdominal contents, and straining 
of ligaments and bony articulations. Under normal circumstances, the 
lung  and  the  passive  chest  wall  enclose  essentially  the  same  volume, 
the only difference being the volumes of the pleural fluid and of the 
lung parenchyma (normally both quite small in the absence of dis-
ease). For this reason and because the lung and chest wall function in 
mechanical series, the pressure required to displace the passive respi-
ratory system (lungs plus chest wall) at any volume is simply the sum 
of the elastic recoil pressure of the lungs and the transmural pressure 
across the chest wall. When plotted against respiratory system volume, 
this relationship assumes a sigmoid shape, exhibiting stiffness at high 
lung  volumes  (imparted  by  the  lung),  stiffness  at  low  lung  volumes 
(imparted by the chest wall or sometimes by airway closure), and com-
pliance in the middle range of lung volumes where normal tidal breath-
ing occurs. In addition, a passive resting point of the respiratory system 
is  attained  when  alveolar  gas  pressure  equals  body  surface  pressure 
(i.e., when the transrespiratory system pressure is zero). At this volume 
(called  the  functional  residual  capacity  [FRC]),  the  outward  recoil  of  
the  chest  wall  is  balanced  exactly  by  the  inward  recoil  of  the  lung. 
As these recoils are transmitted through the pleural fluid, the lung is 
pulled both outward and inward simultaneously at FRC, and thus, its 
pressure falls below atmospheric pressure (typically, −5 cmH2O).

The normal passive respiratory system would equilibrate at the FRC 
and remain there were it not for the actions of the respiratory muscles. 
The inspiratory muscles act on the chest wall to generate the equivalent 
of positive pressure across the lungs and passive chest wall, while the 
expiratory muscles generate the equivalent of negative transrespiratory 
pressure.  The  maximal  pressures  these  sets  of  muscles  can  generate 
vary  with  the  lung  volume  at  which  they  operate.  This  variation  is 
due to length-tension relationships in striated muscle sarcomeres and 
to changes in mechanical advantage as the angles of insertion change 
with lung volume (Fig. 285-1). Nonetheless, under normal conditions, 
the respiratory muscles are substantially “overpowered” for their roles 
and generate more than adequate force to drive the respiratory system 
to its stiffness extremes, as determined by the lung (total lung capacity 
[TLC]) or by chest wall or airway closure (residual volume [RV]); the 
airway  closure  always  prevents  the  adult  lung  from  emptying  com-
pletely under normal circumstances. The excursion between full and 
minimal  lung  inflation  is  called  vital  capacity  (VC;  Fig.  285-2)  and 
is readily seen to be the difference between volumes at two unrelated 
stiffness extremes—one determined by the lung (TLC) and the other by 
the chest wall or airways (RV). Thus, although VC is easy to measure 
(see below), it provides little information about the intrinsic properties 
of the respiratory system. As will become clear, it is much more useful 
for the clinician to consider TLC and RV individually.

Flow-Related  Mechanical  Properties—Dynamics  The 
passive  chest  wall  and  active  neuromuscular  system  both  exhibit 
mechanical  behaviors  related  to  the  rate  of  change  of  volume,  but 
these  behaviors  become  quantitatively  important  only  at  markedly 
supraphysiologic  breathing  frequencies  (e.g.,  during  high-frequency 
mechanical ventilation), and thus will not be addressed here. In con-
trast, the dynamic airflow properties of the lung substantially affect its 
ability to ventilate and contribute importantly to the work of breathing, 
and  these  properties  are  often  deranged  by  disease.  Understanding 
dynamic airflow properties is, therefore, worthwhile.

FIGURE 285-3  Luminal area versus transmural pressure relationship. Transmural 
pressure represents the pressure difference across the airway wall from inside to 
outside.

As with the flow of any fluid (gas or liquid) in any tube, maintenance 
of airflow within the pulmonary airways requires a pressure gradient that 
falls along the direction of flow, the magnitude of which is determined 
by the flow rate and the frictional resistance to flow. During quiet tidal 
breathing, the pressure gradients driving inspiratory or expiratory flow 
are small owing to the very low frictional resistance of normal pulmonary 
airways (Raw, normally <2 cmH2O/L/s). However, during rapid exhalation, 
another phenomenon reduces flow below that which would have been 
expected if frictional resistance were the only impediment to flow. This 
phenomenon is called dynamic airflow limitation, and it occurs because 
the bronchial airways through which air is exhaled are collapsible rather 
than rigid (Fig. 285-3). An important anatomic feature of the structure of 
the pulmonary airways is their tree like branching. While the individual 
airways in each successive generation, from most proximal (trachea) to 
most distal (respiratory bronchioles), are smaller than those of the parent 
generation, their number increases exponentially such that the summed 
cross-sectional area of the airways becomes very large toward the lung 
periphery.  Because  flow  (volume/time)  is  constant  along  the  airway 
tree, the velocity of airflow (flow/summed cross-sectional area) is much 
greater  in  the  central  airways  than  in  the  peripheral  airways.  During 
exhalation, gas leaving the alveoli must, therefore, gain velocity as it pro-
ceeds toward the mouth. The energy required for this “convective” accel-
eration is drawn from the component of gas energy manifested as its local 
pressure,  which  reduces  intraluminal  gas  pressure,  airway  transmural

pressure,  airway  size  (Fig.  285-3),  and  flow.  This  phenomenon  is  the 
Bernoulli  effect,  the  same  effect  that  keeps  an  airplane  airborne,  gen-
erating  a  lifting  force  by  decreasing  pressure  above  the  curved  upper 
surface of the wing due to acceleration of air flowing over the wing. If an 
individual attempts to exhale more forcefully, the local velocity increases 
further and reduces airway size further, resulting in no net increase in 
flow. Under these circumstances, flow has reached its maximum possible 
value,  or  its  flow  limit.  Lungs  normally  exhibit  such  dynamic  airflow 
limitation.  This  limitation  can  be  assessed  by  spirometry,  in  which  an 
individual  inhales  fully  to  TLC  and  then  forcibly  exhales  to  RV.  One 
useful spirometric measure is the volume of air exhaled during the forced 
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), as discussed later. Maximal expiratory 
flow  at  any  lung  volume  is  determined  by  gas  density,  airway  cross- 
section and distensibility, elastic recoil pressure of the lung, and frictional 
pressure loss to the flow-limiting airway site. Under normal conditions, 
maximal  expiratory  flow  falls  with  lung  volume  (Fig.  285-4),  primar-
ily  because  of  the  dependence  of  lung  recoil  pressure  on  lung  volume  
(Fig. 285-1). In pulmonary fibrosis, lung recoil pressure is increased at 
any lung volume, and thus the maximal expiratory flow is elevated when 
considered in relation to lung volume. Conversely, in emphysema, lung 
recoil  pressure  is  reduced;  this  reduction  is  a  principal  mechanism  by 
which  maximal  expiratory  flows  fall.  Diseases  that  narrow  the  airway 
lumen  at  any  transmural  pressure  (e.g.,  asthma  or  chronic  bronchitis) 
or  that  cause  excessive  airway  collapsibility  (e.g.,  tracheomalacia)  also 
reduce maximal expiratory flow.

The  Bernoulli  effect  also  applies  during  inspiration,  but  the  more 
negative pleural pressures during inspiration lower the pressure outside 
of the airways, thereby increasing transmural pressure and promoting 
airway expansion. Thus, inspiratory airflow limitation seldom occurs 
due  to  diffuse  pulmonary  airway  disease.  Conversely,  extrathoracic 
airway narrowing (e.g., due to a tracheal adenoma or post-tracheostomy 
stricture) can lead to inspiratory airflow limitation (Fig. 285-4).

The  Work  of  Breathing 
In  health,  the  elastic  (volume  change- 
related) and dynamic (flow-related) loads that must be overcome to ven-
tilate the lungs at rest are small, and the work required of the respiratory 
muscles is minimal. However, the work of breathing can increase consid-
erably due to a metabolic requirement for substantially increased venti-
lation, an abnormally increased mechanical load, or both. As discussed 
below,  the  rate  of  ventilation  is  primarily  set  by  the  need  to  eliminate

2136 carbon  dioxide,  and  thus,  ventilation  increases  during  exercise  (some-
times  by  >20-fold)  and  during  metabolic  acidosis  as  a  compensatory 
response. Naturally, the work rate required to overcome the elasticity of 
the respiratory system increases with both the depth and the frequency 
of tidal breaths, while the work required to overcome the dynamic load 
increases with total ventilation. A modest increase of ventilation is most 
efficiently achieved by increasing tidal volume but not RR, which is the 
normal ventilatory response to lower-level exercise. At higher levels of 
exercise, deep breathing persists, but RR also increases.

The work of breathing also increases when disease reduces the com-
pliance of the respiratory system or increases the resistance to airflow. 
The  former  occurs  commonly  in  diseases  of  the  lung  parenchyma 
(interstitial processes or fibrosis, alveolar filling diseases such as pul-
monary edema or pneumonia, or substantial lung resection), and the 
latter  occurs  in  obstructive  airway  diseases  such  as  asthma,  chronic 
bronchitis,  emphysema,  and  cystic  fibrosis.  Furthermore,  severe  air-
flow obstruction can functionally reduce the compliance of the respi-
ratory system by leading to dynamic hyperinflation. In this scenario, 
expiratory  flows  slowed  by  the  obstructive  airways  disease  may  be 
insufficient to allow complete exhalation during the expiratory phase 
of tidal breathing; as a result, the “functional residual capacity (FRC)” 
from which the next breath is inhaled is greater than the static FRC. 
With  repetition  of  incomplete  exhalations  of  each  tidal  breath,  the 
operating FRC becomes dynamically elevated, sometimes to a level that 
approaches TLC. At these high lung volumes, the respiratory system is 
much less compliant than at normal breathing volumes, and thus, the 
elastic work of each tidal breath is also increased. The dynamic pulmo-
nary hyperinflation that accompanies severe airflow obstruction causes 
patients to sense difficulty in inhaling—even though the root cause of 
this pathophysiologic abnormality is expiratory airflow obstruction.

Adequacy of Ventilation  As noted above, the respiratory control 
system  that  sets  the  rate  of  ventilation  responds  to  chemical  signals, 
including  arterial  CO2  and  oxygen  tensions  and  blood  pH,  and  to 
volitional  needs,  such  as  the  need  to  inhale  deeply  before  playing  a 
long phrase on the trumpet. Disturbances in ventilation are discussed 
in Chap. 296. The focus of this chapter is on the relationship between 
ventilation of the lung and CO2 elimination.

At the end of each tidal exhalation, the conducting airways are filled 
with  alveolar  gas  that  did  not  reach  the  mouth  when  expiratory  flow 
stopped. During the ensuing inhalation, fresh gas immediately enters the 
airway tree at the mouth, but the gas first entering the alveoli at the start 
of inhalation is that same alveolar gas in the conducting airways that had 
just left the alveoli. Accordingly, fresh gas does not enter the alveoli until 
the volume of the conducting airways has been inspired. This volume is 
called the anatomic dead space (VD). Quiet breathing with tidal volumes 
smaller than the anatomic dead space introduces no fresh gas into the 
alveoli  at  all;  only  that  part  of  the  inspired  tidal  volume  (VT)  that  is 
greater than the VD introduces fresh gas into the alveoli. The dead space 
can be further increased functionally if some of the inspired tidal volume 
is delivered to a part of the lung that receives no pulmonary blood flow 
and thus cannot contribute to gas exchange (e.g., the portion of the lung 
distal to a large pulmonary embolus). In this situation, exhaled minute 
⋅
ventilation (V
E= VT × RR) includes a component of dead space ventila-
⋅
tion (V
D= VD × RR) and a component of fresh gas alveolar ventilation 
⋅
⋅
A= [VT − VD] × RR). CO2 elimination from the alveoli is equal to V
(V
A 
times  the  difference  in  CO2  fraction  between  inspired  air  (essentially 
zero) and alveolar gas (typically ~5.6% after correction for humidifica-
tion of inspired air, corresponding to 40 mmHg). In the steady state, the 
alveolar fraction of CO2 is equal to metabolic CO2 production divided 
by alveolar ventilation. Because, as discussed below, alveolar and arterial 
CO2 tensions are equal, and because the respiratory controller normally 
strives to maintain arterial Pco2 (Paco2) at ~40 mmHg, the adequacy of 
alveolar ventilation is reflected in Paco2 If the Paco2 falls much below 
40  mmHg,  alveolar  hyperventilation  is  present;  if  the  Paco2  exceeds  
40 mmHg, alveolar hypoventilation is present. Ventilatory failure is char-
acterized by extreme alveolar hypoventilation.

As  a  consequence  of  oxygen  uptake  of  alveolar  gas  into  capillary 
blood, alveolar oxygen tension falls below that of inspired gas. The rate 

of  oxygen  uptake  (determined  by  the  body’s  metabolic  oxygen  con-
sumption) is related to the average rate of metabolic CO2 production, 
⋅
and their ratio—the “respiratory quotient” (R = V
o2)—depends 
largely on the fuel being metabolized. For a typical American diet, R is 
usually around 0.85. Together, these phenomena allow the estimation 
of  alveolar  oxygen  tension,  according  to  the  following  relationship, 
known as the alveolar gas equation:

⋅
co2/V

Pao2 = Fio2 × (Pbar - Ph2o) - Paco2/R

The alveolar gas equation also highlights the influences of inspired 
oxygen fraction Fio2 barometric pressure (Pbar), and vapor pressure of 
water  (Ph2o  =  47  mmHg  at  37°C)  in  addition  to  alveolar  ventilation 
(which sets Paco2) in determining Pao2. An implication of the alveolar 
gas equation is that severe arterial hypoxemia rarely occurs as a pure 
consequence of alveolar hypoventilation at sea level while an individual 
is  breathing  air.  The  potential  for  alveolar  hypoventilation  to  induce 
severe  hypoxemia  with  otherwise  normal  lungs  increases  as  Pbar  falls 
with increasing altitude.

 ■ GAS EXCHANGE
Diffusion  For  oxygen  to  be  delivered  to  the  peripheral  tissues,  it 
must pass from alveolar gas into alveolar capillary blood by diffusing 
through  alveolar  membrane.  The  aggregate  alveolar  membrane  is 
highly  optimized  for  this  process,  with  a  very  large  surface  area  and 
minimal  thickness.  Diffusion  through  the  alveolar  membrane  is  so 
efficient in the human lung that in most circumstances hemoglobin of 
a red blood cell becomes fully oxygen saturated by the time the cell has 
traveled  just  one-third  the  length  of  the  alveolar  capillary.  Thus,  the 
uptake of alveolar oxygen is ordinarily limited by the amount of blood 
transiting the alveolar capillaries rather than by the rapidity with which 
oxygen can diffuse across the membrane; consequently, oxygen uptake 
from  the  lung  is  said  to  be  “perfusion  limited”  rather  than  diffusion 
limited.  CO2  also  equilibrates  rapidly  across  the  alveolar  membrane. 
Therefore,  the  oxygen  and  CO2  tensions  in  capillary  blood  leaving  a 
normal  alveolus  are  essentially  equal  to  those  in  alveolar  gas.  Only 
in  rare  circumstances  (e.g.,  at  high  altitude  or  in  high-performance 
athletes exerting maximal effort) is oxygen uptake from normal lungs 
diffusion limited. Diffusion limitation can also occur in interstitial lung 
disease if substantially thickened alveolar walls remain perfused.

⋅
/Q

Ventilation/Perfusion Heterogeneity  As  noted  above,  for  gas 
exchange to be most efficient, ventilation to each individual alveolus 
(among the millions of alveoli) should match perfusion to its accom-
panying capillaries. Because of the differential effects of gravity on lung 
mechanics and blood flow throughout the lung and because of differ-
ences  in  airway  and  vascular  architecture  among  various  respiratory 
paths,  there  is  minor  ventilation/perfusion  heterogeneity  even  in  the 
⋅
normal lung; however, V
 heterogeneity can be particularly marked 
in  disease.  Two  extreme  examples  are  (1)  ventilation  of  unperfused 
lung distal to a pulmonary embolus, in which ventilation of the phys-
iologic dead space is “wasted” in the sense that it does not contribute 
to gas exchange; and (2) perfusion of nonventilated lung (a “shunt”), 
which allows venous blood to pass through the lung unaltered. When 
mixed with fully oxygenated blood leaving other well-ventilated lung 
units,  shunted  venous  blood  disproportionately  lowers  the  mixed 
arterial  Pao2  as  a  result  of  the  nonlinear  oxygen  content  versus  PO2 
relationship  of  hemoglobin  (Fig.  285-5).  Furthermore,  the  resulting 
arterial hypoxemia is refractory to supplemental inspired oxygen. The 
reason is that (1) raising the inspired Fio2 has no effect on alveolar gas 
tensions  in  nonventilated  alveoli  and  (2)  while  raising  inspired  Fio2 
increases Paco2 in ventilated alveoli, the oxygen content of blood exit-
ing ventilated units increases only slightly, as hemoglobin will already 
have been nearly fully saturated and the solubility of oxygen in plasma 
is quite small.

A more common occurrence than the two extreme examples given 
above is a widening of the distribution of ventilation/perfusion ratios; 
⋅
such  V
  heterogeneity  is  a  common  consequence  of  lung  disease. 
In  this  circumstance,  perfusion  of  relatively  underventilated  alveoli

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Although  many  diseases  injure  the  respiratory  system,  this  system 
responds to injury in relatively few ways. For this reason, the pattern of 
physiologic abnormalities may or may not provide sufficient informa-
tion by which to discriminate among conditions.

Figure 285-6 lists abnormalities in pulmonary function testing that 
are typically found in a number of common respiratory disorders and 
highlights  the  simultaneous  occurrence  of  multiple  physiologic  abnor-
malities. The coexistence of some of these respiratory disorders results in 
more complex superposition of these abnormalities. Methods to measure 
respiratory system function clinically are described later in this chapter.

Ventilatory  Restriction  due  to  Increased  Elastic  Recoil— 
Example: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
Idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis  raises  lung  recoil  at  all  lung  volumes,  thereby  lowering  TLC, 
FRC, and RV as well as forced vital capacity (FVC). Maximal expiratory 

flows  are  also  reduced  from  normal  values  but  are  elevated  when 
considered  in  relation  to  lung  volumes.  Increased  flow  occurs  both 
because  the  increased  lung  recoil  drives  greater  maximal  flow  at  any 
lung volume and because airway diameters are relatively increased due 
to greater radially outward traction exerted on bronchi by the stiff lung 
parenchyma.  For  the  same  reason,  airway  resistance  is  also  normal. 
Destruction of the pulmonary capillaries by the fibrotic process results 
in a marked reduction in diffusing capacity (see below). Oxygenation is 
often severely reduced by persistent perfusion of alveolar units that are 
relatively underventilated due to fibrosis of nearby (and mechanically 
linked) lung due to those alveolar units already being stretched to their 
maximum volume with little further increase in volume with inspira-
tion. The flow-volume loop (see below) looks like a miniature version 
of  a  normal  loop  but  is  shifted  toward  lower  absolute  lung  volumes 
and displays maximal expiratory flows that are increased for any given 
volume over the normal tracing.

Ventilatory  Restriction  due  to  Chest  Wall  Abnormality—
Example: Moderate Obesity  As the size of the average American 
continues  to  increase,  this  pattern  may  become  the  most  common  of 
pulmonary  function  abnormalities.  In  moderate  obesity,  the  outward 
recoil of the chest wall is blunted by the weight of chest wall fat and the 
space occupied by intraabdominal fat. In this situation, preserved inward 
recoil of the lung overbalances the reduced outward recoil of the chest 
wall, and FRC falls. Because respiratory muscle strength and lung recoil 
remain normal, TLC is typically unchanged (although it may fall in mas-
sive obesity) and RV is normal (but may be reduced in massive obesity). 
Mild hypoxemia may be present due to perfusion of alveolar units that 
are poorly ventilated because of airway closure in dependent portions of

for Raw, which is expressed as cmH2O/L/s (normal, <2 cmH2O/L/s). The figures at the bottom of each column show the typical configuration of flow-volume loops in each 
condition, including the flow-volume relationship during tidal breathing. b.d., bronchodilator; Dlco diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide; FEV1, forced expiratory

the lung during breathing near the reduced FRC. Flows remain normal, 
as does the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide Dlco 
unless obstructive sleep apnea (which often accompanies obesity) and 
associated  chronic  intermittent  hypoxemia  have  induced  pulmonary 
arterial hypertension, in which case Dlco may be low.

Ventilatory  Restriction  due  to  Reduced  Muscle  Strength—
Example: Myasthenia Gravis 
In this circumstance, FRC remains 
normal, as both lung recoil and passive chest wall recoil are normal. 
However,  TLC  is  low  and  RV  is  elevated  because  respiratory  muscle 
strength  is  insufficient  to  push  the  passive  respiratory  system  fully 
toward either volume extreme. Caught between the low TLC and the 
elevated RV, FVC and FEV1 are reduced as “innocent bystanders.” As 
airway  size  and  lung  vasculature  are  unaffected,  both  Raw  and  Dlco 
are normal. Oxygenation is normal unless weakness becomes so severe 
that  the  patient  has  insufficient  strength  to  reopen  collapsed  alveoli 
during sighs, with resulting atelectasis.

Airflow  Obstruction  due  to  Decreased  Airway  Diameter—
Example:  Acute  Asthma  During  an  episode  of  acute  asthma, 
luminal  narrowing  due  to  smooth  muscle  constriction  as  well  as 
inflammation  and  thickening  within  the  small-  and  medium-sized 
bronchi raise frictional resistance and reduce airflow. “Scooping” of the 
flow-volume loop is caused by reduction of airflow, especially at lower 
lung volumes. Often, airflow obstruction can be reversed by inhalation 
of β2-adrenergic agonists acutely or by treatment with inhaled steroids 
chronically.  TLC  usually  remains  normal  (although  elevated  TLC  is 
sometimes  seen  in  long-standing  asthma),  but  FRC  may  be  dynami-
cally elevated. RV is often increased due to exaggerated airway closure 
at low lung volumes, and this elevation of RV reduces FVC. Because 
central  airways  are  narrowed,  Raw  is  usually  elevated.  Mild  arterial 
hypoxemia is often present due to perfusion of relatively underventi-
lated alveoli distal to obstructed airways (and is responsive to oxygen 
supplementation), but Dlco is normal or mildly elevated.

Airflow  Obstruction  due  to  Decreased  Elastic  Recoil— 
Example:  Severe  Emphysema  Loss  of  lung  elastic  recoil  in 
severe  emphysema  results  in  pulmonary  hyperinflation,  of  which 
elevated  TLC  is  the  hallmark.  FRC  is  more  severely  elevated  due  to 
both loss of lung elastic recoil and dynamic hyperinflation—the same 

phenomenon  as  auto-PEEP  (auto–positive  end-expiratory  pressure), 
which  is  the  positive  end-expiratory  alveolar  pressure  that  occurs 
when  a  new  breath  is  initiated  before  the  lung  volume  is  allowed  to 
return to FRC. RV is very severely elevated because of airway closure 
and because exhalation toward RV may take so long that RV cannot be 
reached before the patient must inhale again. Both FVC and FEV1 are 
markedly decreased, the former because of the severe elevation of RV 
and  the  latter  because  loss  of  lung  elastic  recoil  reduces  the  pressure 
driving  maximal  expiratory  flow  and  also  reduces  tethering  open  of 
small  intrapulmonary  airways.  The  flow-volume  loop  demonstrates 
marked  scooping,  with  an  initial  transient  spike  of  flow  attributable 
largely to expulsion of air from collapsing central airways at the onset 
of forced exhalation. Otherwise, the central airways remain relatively 
unaffected,  so  Raw  is  normal  in  “pure”  emphysema.  Loss  of  alveolar 
surface  and  capillaries  in  the  alveolar  walls  reduces  DLco;  however, 
because  poorly  ventilated  emphysematous  acini  are  also  poorly  per-
fused (due to loss of their capillaries), arterial hypoxemia usually is not 
seen  at  rest  until  emphysema  becomes  very  severe.  However,  during 
exercise,  Pao2  may  fall  precipitously  if  extensive  destruction  of  the 
pulmonary  vasculature  prevents  a  sufficient  increase  in  cardiac  out-
put and mixed venous oxygen content falls substantially. Under these 
⋅
circumstances,  any  venous  admixture  through  low  V
  units  has  a 
particularly marked effect in lowering mixed arterial oxygen tension.
 ■ FUNCTIONAL MEASUREMENTS
Measurement  of  Ventilatory  Function  •  LUNG  VOLUMES  
Figure 285-2 demonstrates a spirometry tracing in which the volume 
of air entering or exiting the lung is plotted over time. In a slow vital 
capacity  maneuver,  the  patient  inhales  from  FRC,  fully  inflating  the 
lungs  to  TLC,  and  then  exhales  slowly  to  RV;  VC,  the  difference 
between TLC and RV, represents the maximal excursion of the respi-
ratory  system.  Spirometry  discloses  relative  volume  changes  during 
these  maneuvers  but  cannot  reveal  the  absolute  volumes  at  which 
they occur. To determine absolute lung volumes, two approaches are 
commonly used: inert gas dilution and body plethysmography. In the 
former, a known amount of a nonabsorbable inert gas (usually helium 
or  neon)  is  inhaled  in  a  single  large  breath  or  is  rebreathed  from  a 
closed circuit; the inert gas is diluted by the gas resident in the lung at 
the time of inhalation, and its final concentration reveals the volume

of resident gas contributing to the dilution. A drawback of this method 
is  that  regions  of  the  lung  that  ventilate  poorly  (e.g.,  due  to  airflow 
obstruction)  may  not  receive  much  inspired  inert  gas  and  so  do  not 
contribute to its dilution. Therefore, inert gas dilution (especially in the 
single-breath method) often underestimates true lung volumes.

In the second approach, FRC is determined by measuring the com-
pressibility of gas within the chest, which is proportional to the volume 
of  gas  being  compressed.  The  patient  sits  in  a  body  plethysmograph  
(a chamber usually made of transparent plastic to minimize claustro-
phobia) and, at the end of a normal tidal breath (i.e., when lung volume 
is at FRC), is instructed to pant against a closed shutter, thus periodi-
cally compressing air within the lung slightly. Pressure fluctuations at 
the  mouth  and  volume  fluctuations  within  the  body  box  (equal  but 
opposite to those in the chest) are determined, and from these mea-
surements,  the  thoracic  gas  volume  is  calculated  by  means  of  Boyle’s 
law. Once FRC is obtained, TLC and RV are calculated by adding the 
value for inspiratory capacity and subtracting the value for expiratory 
reserve volume, respectively (both values having been obtained during 
spirometry) (Fig. 285-2). The most important determinants of healthy 
individuals’ lung volumes are height, age, and sex, but there is consid-
erable additional normal variation beyond that accounted for by these 
parameters. In addition, race influences lung volumes; on average, TLC 
values are ~12% lower in African Americans and 6% lower in Asian 
Americans than in Caucasian Americans. In practice, a mean “normal” 
value  is  predicted  by  multivariate  regression  equations  using  height, 
age, and sex, and the patient’s value is divided by the predicted value 
(often with “race correction” applied) to determine “percent predicted.” 
For most measures of lung function, 85–115% of the predicted value 
can be normal; however, in health, the various lung volumes tend to 
scale together. For example, if one is “normal big” with a TLC 110% 
of  the  predicted  value,  all  other  lung  volumes  and  spirometry  values 
will also approximate 110% of their respective predicted values. This 
pattern is particularly helpful in evaluating airflow, as discussed below.

AIR  FLOW  As  noted  above,  spirometry  plays  a  key  role  in  lung  vol-
ume determination. Even more often, spirometry is used to measure 
airflow, which reflects the dynamic properties of the lung. During an 
FVC  maneuver,  the  patient  inhales  to  TLC  and  then  exhales  rapidly 
and forcefully to RV; this method ensures that flow limitation has been 
achieved, so that the precise effort made has little influence on actual 
flow. The total amount of air exhaled is the FVC, and the amount of air 
exhaled in the first second is the FEV1; the FEV1 is a flow rate, revealing 
volume change per time. Like lung volumes, an individual’s maximal 
expiratory flows should be compared with predicted values based on 
height, age, and sex. While the FEV1/FVC ratio is typically reduced in 
airflow obstruction, this condition can also reduce FVC by raising RV, 
sometimes rendering the FEV1/FVC ratio “artifactually normal” with 
the  erroneous  implication  that  airflow  obstruction  is  absent.  To  cir-
cumvent this problem, it is useful to compare FEV1 as a fraction of its 
predicted value with TLC as a fraction of its predicted value. In health, 
the results are usually similar. In contrast, even an FEV1 value that is 
95% of its predicted value may actually be relatively low if TLC is 110% 
of its respective predicted value. In this case, airflow obstruction may 
be present, despite the “normal” value for FEV1.

The relationships among volume, flow, and time during spirometry 
are best displayed in two plots—the spirogram (volume vs time) and 
the  flow-volume  loop  (flow  vs  volume)  (Fig.  285-4).  In  conditions 
that  cause  airflow  obstruction,  the  site  of  obstruction  is  sometimes 
correlated  with  the  shape  of  the  flow-volume  loop.  In  diseases  that 
cause  lower  airway  obstruction,  such  as  asthma  and  emphysema, 
flows  decrease  more  rapidly  with  declining  lung  volumes,  leading  to 
a  characteristic  scooping  of  the  flow-volume  loop.  In  contrast,  fixed 
upper-airway obstruction typically leads to inspiratory and/or expira-
tory flow plateaus (Fig. 285-4).
AIRWAYS  RESISTANCE  The  total  resistance  of  the  pulmonary  and 
upper airways is measured in the same body plethysmograph used to 
measure FRC. The patient is asked once again to pant, but this time 
against  a  closed  and  then  opened  shutter.  Panting  against  the  closed 
shutter  reveals  the  thoracic  gas  volume  as  described  above.  When 

the  shutter  is  opened,  flow  is  directed  to  and  from  the  body  box,  so 
that  volume  fluctuations  in  the  box  reveal  the  extent  of  thoracic  gas 
compression,  which  in  turn  reveals  the  pressure  fluctuations  driving 
flow.  Simultaneous  measurement  of  flow  allows  the  calculation  of 
lung resistance (as flow divided by pressure). In health, Raw is very low  
(<2  cmH2O/L/s),  and  half  of  the  detected  resistance  resides  within 
the upper airway. In the lung, most resistance originates in the central 
airways. For this reason, airways resistance measurement tends to be 
insensitive to peripheral airflow obstruction.
RESPIRATORY  MUSCLE  STRENGTH  To  measure  respiratory  muscle 
strength,  the  patient  is  instructed  to  exhale  or  inhale  with  maximal 
effort against a closed shutter while pressure is monitored at the mouth. 
Pressures >±60 cmH2O at FRC are considered adequate and make it 
unlikely that respiratory muscle weakness accounts for any other rest-
ing ventilatory dysfunction that is identified.

Measurement  of  Gas  Exchange  •  DIFFUSING  CAPACITY 
(Dlco)  This test uses a small (and safe) amount of carbon monoxide 
(CO)  to  measure  gas  exchange  across  the  alveolar  membrane  during 
a 10-s breath hold. CO in exhaled breath is analyzed to determine the 
quantity of CO crossing the alveolar membrane and combining with 
hemoglobin in red blood cells. This “single-breath diffusing capacity” 
(Dlco) value increases with the surface area available for diffusion and 
the amount of hemoglobin within the capillaries, and it varies inversely 
with alveolar membrane thickness. Thus, Dlco decreases in diseases 
that thicken or destroy alveolar membranes (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis, 
emphysema),  curtail  the  pulmonary  vasculature  (e.g.,  pulmonary 
hypertension), or reduce alveolar capillary hemoglobin (e.g., anemia). 
Single-breath  diffusing  capacity  may  be  elevated  in  acute  congestive 
heart failure, asthma, polycythemia, and pulmonary hemorrhage.

Arterial  Blood  Gases  The  effectiveness  of  gas  exchange  can  be 
assessed  by  measuring  the  partial  pressures  of  oxygen  and  CO2  in  a 
sample  of  blood  obtained  by  arterial  puncture.  The  oxygen  content 
of blood (CaO2) depends on arterial saturation (%O2Sat), which is set 
by Pao2 pH, and Paco2 according to the oxyhemoglobin dissociation 
curve. CaO2 can also be measured by oximetry (see below):

CaO2 (mL/dL) = 1.39 (mL/dL) × [hemoglobin] (g) × % O2 Sat  
+ 0.003 (mL/dL/mmHg) × Pao2 (mmHg)

If hemoglobin saturation alone needs to be determined, this task can 

be accomplished noninvasively with pulse oximetry.

286 Diagnostic Procedures  
in Respiratory Disease
George R. Washko, Hilary J. Goldberg,  
Majid Shafiq

Diagnostic procedures in respiratory disease encompass a wide array of 
invasive and noninvasive modalities. Methods for acquiring diagnostic 
specimens  are  described  in  this  chapter,  as  are  the  various  imaging 
modalities at hand. Pulmonary function tests and measurements of 
gas exchange are described in Chap. 284.

BEDSIDE PLEURAL PROCEDURES
 ■ THORACENTESIS
Thoracentesis,  also  known  as  pleurocentesis,  refers  to  percutaneous 
aspiration  of  fluid  from  the  pleural  space.  The  right  and  left  pleural 
spaces do not normally communicate with each other, and either can 
be  directly  accessed  between  the  thoracic  ribs.  The  current  standard 
of care entails using point-of-care ultrasonography to mark the site of 
needle puncture; this reduces the risks of “dry tap” as well as complica-
tions such as pneumothorax. Beside palliation of symptoms associated 
with  pleural  effusion  (most  commonly  dyspnea),  thoracentesis  may 
be performed for diagnostic purposes. The range of hematologic, bio-
chemical, microbiologic, and cytologic pleural fluid studies has largely 
remained unchanged over the past few decades, as has the widespread 
adoption  of  Light’s  criteria  for  distinguishing  exudates  from  tran-
sudates  that  were  described  in  1972.  However,  newer  assays  such  as 
mesothelin-1  testing  for  neoplastic  diseases  (chiefly  mesothelioma) 
have  also  become  available  more  recently.  More  details  on  pleural 
fluid testing are described in Chap. 294.

 ■ CLOSED PLEURAL BIOPSY
Closed pleural biopsy involves percutaneous sampling of the parietal 
pleural lining. This procedure can be performed either “blindly” (typ-
ically with an Abrams needle) or by using imaging guidance such as 
CT or ultrasound. Closed pleural biopsy without ultrasound guidance 
is highly sensitive for pleural tuberculosis, owing to the diffuse pleural 
involvement that is typically seen in those cases.

Image-guided closed pleural biopsy is most helpful in case of focal 
pleural  abnormalities  such  as  pleural  nodules,  which  are  virtually 
pathognomonic of malignant involvement. Limited studies have shown 
high diagnostic yields of around 80–90% with this modality, but patient 
selection  is  key  as  the  diagnostic  performance  may  be  considerably 
lower  in  the  absence  of  a  specific  pleural  abnormality  that  could  be 
visualized.  Between  CT  and  ultrasound  imaging,  only  ultrasound  is 
typically performed in real-time during the act of obtaining the biopsy.

THORACIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES
 ■ THORACOSCOPY AND THORACOTOMY
Thoracoscopy  and  thoracotomy  encompass  a  spectrum  of  surgical 
procedures  that  involve  accessing  and  operating  within  the  pleural 
space,  either  via  one  or  more  small  entry  ports  using  thoracoscopic 
tools or via larger incisions as in thoracotomy (Fig. 286-1). Thoracos-
copy varies in its scope considerably. An interventional pulmonologist 
typically performs a pleuroscopy (also known as medical thoracoscopy) 
and accesses the pleural space through a single port for parietal pleural 
biopsy or for limited therapeutic purposes such as minor lysis of adhe-
sions, thoracoscopic pleurodesis, or indwelling pleural catheter place-
ment. This procedure can usually be performed safely under conscious 
sedation.  On  the  other  hand,  video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgery 
(VATS)  and  robotic-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgery  (RATS)  represent 
more  invasive  procedures  but  with  more  controlled  environments 
entailing  general  anesthesia  with  single-lung  ventilation,  creation  of 
multiple entry ports, and several additional diagnostic and therapeutic 

FIGURE  286-1  Thoracoscopy  demonstrating  numerous  parietal  pleural  nodules

possibilities  including,  but  not  limited  to,  lung  biopsy,  lymph  node 
sampling, lobectomy, decortication, and creation of a pericardial win-
dow. Open thoracotomy uses wider incisions and more conventional 
surgical techniques for performing all of the above as well as additional 
tasks such as creation of a Clagett window for chronic bronchopleural 
fistula with empyema.

 ■ MEDIASTINOSCOPY AND MEDIASTINOTOMY
Surgical access to the mediastinum, either through a small port (medi-
astinoscopy) or a wider incision (mediastinotomy), enables diagnostic 
sampling  of  mediastinal  structures  such  as  mediastinal  lymph  nodes 
as part of lung cancer staging. With the advent of endoscopic needle-
based techniques (see below), surgery is no longer considered the first-
line option for diagnostic lymph node sampling but is recommended in 
cases of negative needle-based sampling where suspicion for malignant 
nodal involvement remains sufficiently high.

BRONCHOSCOPY
Bronchoscopy,  which  entails  passing  a  tube  with  a  lighted  camera 
inside  the  lower  respiratory  tract,  includes  flexible  and  rigid  bron-
choscopy (termed after the physical properties of each bronchoscope). 
Flexible  bronchoscopy  is  by  far  the  more  commonly  used  form  and 
enables access to more distal parts of the respiratory tract. The rigid 
bronchoscope, although limited to the central airways, has the added 
advantage of providing a secure airway for ventilation; artificial breaths 
can then be administered through the scope itself as part of a closed 
circuit  or  through  open  jet  ventilation.  The  rigid  bronchoscope  also 
provides  a  conduit  for  diagnostic  or  therapeutic  instruments  to  be 
passed  freely,  rather  than  through  the  relatively  constrained  working 
channel of a flexible bronchoscope. When bronchoscopy is limited to 
diagnostic indications, the rigid bronchoscope is seldom used except 
on occasion as a precautionary measure for anticipated severe bleeding 
where having a more secure airway might be particularly advantageous 
(e.g., in transbronchial cryobiopsy). Different types of diagnostic bron-
choscopic procedures are described below.

Bronchoalveolar  Lavage  Bronchoalveolar  lavage  (BAL)  is  the 
gold  standard  method  for  obtaining  respiratory  secretions  for  hema-
tologic,  biochemical,  microbiological,  and/or  cytologic  analyses.  It 
avoids  the  risk  of  salivary  contamination,  which  may  be  seen  in  a 
sputum specimen, and is particularly useful when sputum cannot be 
obtained or when sampling of a specific pulmonary lobe or segment is 
desired. After wedging the bronchoscope in a distal airway in order to 
prevent fluid escape around the scope, sterile saline or distilled water is 
instilled through the scope’s working channel (typically in one to three 
aliquots  of  approximately  50  mL  each).  Immediately  thereafter,  suc-
tion is applied to aspirate as much of the fluid as possible. This allows 
sampling  of  distal  airways  and  lung  parenchyma—areas  not  directly 
viewable  or  accessible.  If  there  is  concern  for  alveolar  hemorrhage, 
serial BALs from the same site may show rising red blood cell counts 
and even visibly bloodier returns with subsequent lavages.

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory SystemBrushing  and  Endobronchial  Biopsy  Bronchoscopic  brush-
ing  is  a  minimally  invasive  sampling  technique  that  can  be  used  to 
sample  the  mucosal  biofilm  for  microbiologic  analyses  as  well  as  the 
bronchial epithelial layer for cytologic analyses. Endobronchial biopsy 
allows  sampling  of  abnormal  bronchial  mucosa  and  submucosa  for 
histopathologic analysis (as may be indicated in cases of endobronchial 
amyloidosis  or  sarcoidosis,  for  example).  Among  cigarette  smokers 
with  one  or  more  lung  nodules  and  a  nondiagnostic  bronchoscopy, 
bronchial brushings can be used with a commercially available classifier 
that estimates lung cancer probability based on a gene expression sig-
nature. Patients with intermediate pretest probability who end up with 
low posttest probability can more confidently opt for imaging surveil-
lance, thus avoiding further invasive testing and related complications.

Transbronchial Biopsy Including Cryobiopsy  Transbronchial 
biopsy involves removing a piece of alveolated lung tissue by passing a 
sampling tool into the alveolar space. The most commonly employed 
biopsy tool is flexible forceps, typically 2.0 mm or 2.8 mm in caliber. 
When a specific pulmonary lesion such as a lung nodule is being biop-
sied,  various  imaging  and  navigation  tools  (described  below)  may  be 
used to help guide the site of forceps biopsy. When random sampling 
of the lung parenchyma is desired, e.g., to assess for posttransplant lung 
rejection, either fluoroscopic guidance or tactile feedback is commonly 
used to position the forceps in the subpleural lung parenchyma. Lim-
ited data point to three biopsy samples being adequate for optimizing 
sensitivity  in  case  of  malignant  lung  nodules.  On  the  other  hand,  at 
least five distinct pieces of alveolated lung tissue are needed for formal 
diagnosis  of  acute  cellular  rejection  among  lung  transplant  recipients 
per current recommendations. An increasingly popular biopsy tool is 
the  cryoprobe,  a  flexible  catheter  with  a  blunt  tip  that  delivers  liquid 
nitrogen or carbon dioxide over a few seconds to freeze a portion of 
lung parenchyma and make it adhere to the probe itself. Before the tis-
sue can thaw and detach, the probe is pulled back (typically along with 

the bronchoscope itself), and a frozen piece of lung tissue is removed 
alongside. Cryobiopsy has a higher diagnostic yield than forceps biopsy 
for diffuse parenchymal illnesses such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
but comes with a higher risk of major bleeding and pneumothorax.

Transbronchial Needle Aspiration  Transbronchial needle aspi-
ration  (TBNA)  involves  using  a  hollow-bore  needle  for  obtaining 
aspirated specimens. This may be accompanied by suction or simply 
rely  on  capillary  action,  with  data  not  pointing  to  suction  impacting 
diagnostic  sensitivity.  TBNA  has  diagnostic  sensitivity  superior  to 
that  of  transbronchial  biopsy  for  malignant  peripheral  nodules.  This 
makes intuitive sense given that the lesion may lie extraluminally and 
require traversing the airway wall, which only the needle may be able 
to  accomplish.  Furthermore,  combining  TBNA  with  conventional 
transbronchial biopsy appears to increase pooled diagnostic sensitivity.

Endobronchial  Ultrasound-Guided  Transbronchial  Needle 
Aspiration  Endobronchial  ultrasound  (EBUS)  and  EBUS-guided 
transbronchial  needle  aspiration  (EBUS-TBNA)  represent  a  major 
advance  in  diagnostic  bronchoscopy  over  the  turn  of  the  twentieth 
century, largely replacing surgical methods for lymph node sampling. 
EBUS-TBNA  involves  using  a  specialized  flexible  bronchoscope  that 
simultaneously operates a video camera and a convex ultrasound probe 
(which is installed at its distal end). Under real-time ultrasonographic 
visualization, the aspiration needle is inserted through the airway wall 
into  the  mediastinal  target  and  the  aspirate  is  sent  for  microbiologic 
or cytologic analyses as indicated (Fig. 286-2). Newer variants of this 
technique  involve  the  use  of  core  needles  or  mini-forceps,  providing 
tissue specimens rather than aspirates that can be sent for histopatho-
logic analysis. EBUS-TBNA has a sensitivity of approximately 90% for 
epithelial malignancies and approximately 70% for lymphoma (higher 
for  detecting  cases  of  lymphoma  recurrence  than  for  de  novo  lym-
phoma). For sarcoidosis, estimates point to a sensitivity of at least 80%

EBUS-TBNA has been shown to provide adequate amounts of material 
to provide ancillary testing in cases of malignancy, such as immunos-
taining or genetic testing. A related needle-based technique, also using 
ultrasound guidance, involves sampling mediastinal structures through 
the esophagus, which can be a useful adjunct to EBUS-TBNA as it may 
provide better access to certain mediastinal lymph node stations. The 
combined  sensitivity  of  these  two  techniques  is  slightly  higher  com-
pared to either one alone. Esophageal sampling can be accomplished 
either by inserting the same EBUS bronchoscope through the esopha-
gus or by using the standard endoscope used by gastroenterologists for 
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).

At  many  centers,  EBUS-TBNA  is  accompanied  by  rapid  on-site 
cytologic evaluation (ROSE), wherein a portion of the aspirated spec-
imen  is  immediately  examined  by  a  cytotechnologist  or  pathologist 
using rapid staining. This rapid assessment, while often inadequate for 
a definitive final diagnosis, can be helpful in establishing adequacy of 
sampled material by providing the bronchoscopist with real-time feed-
back on whether additional sampling is advisable.

The  optimal  way  to  process  samples  obtained  via  EBUS-TBNA  is 
unknown. Some centers practice the tissue coagulum clot method, in 
which multiple aspirates are emptied onto a single piece of filter paper 
to  form  a  clot  that  can  help  with  preparation  of  a  cell  block.  Other 
centers simply use the residue from spun specimens for this purpose. 
There is no conclusive evidence that one technique is superior to the 
other, but this question has not been well studied to date.

Guided Peripheral Bronchoscopy  Guided peripheral bronchos-
copy involves the use of advanced tools to aid with one or more of three 
tasks  involved  in  successful  bronchoscopic  sampling  of  peripherally 
located  lesions,  such  as  lung  nodules  (see  below).  Various  tools  are 
available to help the bronchoscopist accomplish these tasks (Fig. 286-3). 

(A)   Navigating to the appropriate lobe/segment/subsegment: Electro-
magnetic  navigational  bronchoscopy  (which  involves  GPS-like 
feedback as the bronchoscope is advanced toward the target) and 
virtual bronchoscopy (which overlays live endoscopic images onto 
a CT-derived virtual bronchoscopic map) can help with successful 
navigation  through  the  airways.  Shape-sensing  technology,  used 

as  part  of  one  robotic  bronchoscopy  platform  (see  below),  also 
aims to achieve the same purpose.

(B)   The  aforementioned  technologies  can  also  help  localize  a  lesion, 
although  they  are  limited  by  relying  on  previously  acquired  CT 
images that may or may not accurately represent precisely where 
the  lesion  is  currently  located  in  a  three-dimensional  space. 
Radial  EBUS  uses  a  thin  ultrasound-tipped  catheter  that  can  be 
passed  through  the  bronchoscope’s  working  channel  all  the  way 
to the lung periphery. This provides real-time images of structures 
beyond airway walls. A concentric image of the target, indicating 
a lesion with the airway going through its center, is associated with 
a  high  diagnostic  yield.  Alternatively,  fluoroscopic  imaging  can 
be  used  to  recalibrate  the  precise  target  location  on  navigational 
bronchoscopic  platforms,  potentially  improving  localization  as 
well.  Cone-beam  CT,  which  is  a  distilled  version  of  CT  imaging 
that  has  been  used  intra-procedurally  in  multiple  other  fields 
such as interventional radiology, can be used for confirmation of 
optimal tool-in-lesion (with the patient undergoing a breath hold) 
prior to sampling.

(C)   The tools available for peripheral sampling include biopsy forceps, 
brushes,  and  aspiration  needles  as  described  above,  with  TBNA 
having  the  highest  diagnostic  sensitivity  for  discrete  malignant 
lesions.  Evidence  for  use  of  cryobiopsy  for  sampling  discrete 
lesions in the lung periphery is currently limited. Recent innova-
tions also include steerable sampling tools, which hold promise for 
more optimal sampling of the target lesion.

Robotic Bronchoscopy 
In 2018, the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) approved two robotic bronchoscopy platforms for com-
mercial  use.  These  platforms  offer  improved  bronchoscope  stability 
and  reach,  but  whether  navigation,  target  localization,  and  adequacy 
of sampling are superior to other techniques is less certain. Early data 
on diagnostic yields are encouraging, but multicenter prospective data 
are not yet available.

MEDICAL IMAGING
Imaging  has  revolutionized  the  practice  of  medicine.  Technologies 
such as x-ray, CT, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) can 
provide noninvasive assessments of alveolar perfusion, the metabolic

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemactivity  of  a  lung  nodule,  the  bronchovascular  source  of  hemoptysis, 
or the earliest disease-related changes in parenchymal structure. Given 
the  breadth  of  advances  in  respiratory  system  imaging  and  increas-
ingly specialized applications across diseases, the following section is 
organized by technology. The final part of this section is dedicated to 
deep learning and the role it is increasingly playing in medical image 
interpretation.
 ■ CHEST X-RAY
The  field  of  medical  imaging  can  be  traced  back  to  work  done  by 
Wilhelm Roentgen in the 1890s. Roentgen noted that after connecting 
a cathode ray tube to a power supply, material in his lab would fluo-
resce even if the emission of visible light from the tube was blocked. 
He quickly deduced the presence of additional invisible “x-rays” and 
subsequently  observed  that  their  passage  through  solid  material  was 
attenuated  in  proportion  to  the  material’s  density.  Within  weeks  of 
its  discovery,  x-ray  technology  was  being  widely  leveraged  to  guide 
surgical  exploration  and  the  extraction  of  foreign  objects  such  as 
shrapnel from the battlefield. Chest x-ray (CXR) has since become the 
foundation of clinical practice for respiratory medicine and is a widely 
available technology even in resource-limited settings.

The most commonly used CXR images for respiratory medicine are 
the posteroanterior (PA) and lateral films in the outpatient setting and 
anteroposterior  (AP)  films  for  those  studies  obtained  at  the  bedside. 
These  are  2-dimensional  representations  of  3-dimensional  structures 
and the differing views can be used to examine superimposed struc-
tures (for example, a parenchymal opacity in the retrocardiac space). 
The contours of the chest wall, the silhouette of the heart, great vessels, 
and  mediastinum,  as  well  as  the  appearance  of  the  parenchyma  and 
bronchovascular  bundle  are  all  used  to  detect  and  classify  disease  as 
well as monitor its progression or response to therapeutic intervention. 
An example of a normal PA and lateral CXR is provided in Fig. 286-4.
In  this  image  of  the  normal  lung,  many  of  the  smaller  structures 
such  as  the  lymphatics  and  distal  airways  are  beyond  the  ability  of 
conventional x-ray technology to resolve. Larger structures such as the 
pulmonary vasculature may also be indistinct because of body position 
and the redistribution of blood flow to more gravitationally dependent 
regions.  Diseases  involving  these  structures  may  enhance  or  obscure 
their appearance. An example of these diseases is congestive heart fail-
ure where the lymphatics become engorged (Kerley B lines), the non-
dependent vasculature more prominent (cephalization), and the outer

boundaries of the bronchial walls blurred (bronchial cuffing). Each of 
these findings must be clinically contextualized and while a thickened 
interstitium may be due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema, it may also 
be  indicative  of  interstitial  lung  disease  or  carcinomatosis.  CXR  can 
also be used to discriminate pulmonary and extra-pulmonary disease 
and because of that it is an excellent initial diagnostic for nonspecific 
symptoms. An elevated hemidiaphragm, fibrosis of the mediastinum, 
or hyperlucency of the lung parenchyma all reflect processes that cause 
dyspnea, but their treatment and prognosis differ markedly.
 ■ COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY
CT was introduced to clinical care in the 1980s and quickly became one 
of  the  most  heavily  leveraged  modalities  for  medical  imaging.  While 
CXR provides one or two views of the thorax from which an experi-
enced  clinician  must  disambiguate  overlying  structures,  CT  provides 
spatially  resolved  reconstructions  of  all  structures  in  the  thorax.  The 
acquisition  of  a  CT  scan  involves  the  same  basic  process  as  an  x-ray 
with a patient placed between a source of photons and a detector, but 
the image reconstruction and advanced analytics that can be applied to 
those images differ markedly. The passage of photons through the body 
is impeded in proportion to tissue density. This absorption or atten-
uation  of  photon  passage  is  measured  in  Hounsfield  units  (HU)  and 
clinical  CT  scanners  are  regularly  calibrated  to  a  standard  scale  with 
water having an HU of 0 and air –1000 HU. The broad range of tissue 
densities (reflected as attenuation values) in the thorax and the limited 
human ability to visually discriminate between two structures of simi-
lar densities are addressed by modifying the image display. A window 
width and level (the range and center of the range of HU values to dis-
play) is selected to optimize viewing structures of interest. For example, 
lung  windows  are  optimized  for  visual  inspection  of  the  low-density 
lung parenchyma and all of the surrounding higher-density structures 
appear white, whereas the mediastinal windows are optimized to view 
the higher-density structures and anything of lower tissue density such 
as the lung parenchyma appears black. This does not change the HU 
values of the voxels (3-dimensional pixels) in the image, just their pre-
sentation for visual inspection.

The visual interpretation of thoracic CT is based upon the appear-
ance of the secondary pulmonary lobule. This structure is a fundamen-
tal subunit of the lung consisting of a central airway and pulmonary 
artery, parenchyma, and then surrounding interstitium with the lym-
phatics and pulmonary veins (Fig. 286-5).

Processes  affecting  the  small  airways  such  as  respiratory  bronchi-
olitis may appear as centrilobular nodules. Parenchymal diseases such 
as emphysema may begin by effacing the centroid of the lobule (CLE: 
centrilobular emphysema), the periphery of the lobule (PSE: paraseptal 
emphysema), or diffusely across the lobule (PLE: panlobular emphy-
sema).  Pathology  of  the  lymphatics  or  interstitium  (interstitial  lung 
disease, ILD) results in beading and/or thickening of the interlobular 
septa. Examples of many of these processes are provided in Chaps. 
292 and 293.

The  diagnostic  information  provided  by  the  appearance  of  the 
secondary pulmonary lobule is further augmented by the distribution 
of these patterns of injury across the lung. Whereas CLE tends to first 
appear  in  the  upper  lung  zones,  PLE  has  a  predilection  to  be  basilar 
predominant. Interstitial thickening in the apices is more likely to be 
nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) while a basal and depen-
dent predominant distribution of that same process is more consistent 
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Finally, morphology of the central airways and vessels can be used to 
diagnose disease and estimate its severity. Bronchiectatic dilation of the 

airways may be cylindrical and predominantly in the lower lobes as is 
seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic dilation 
in the upper lobes (cystic fibrosis), or there may be a focal nonspecific 
dilation of an airway due to prior infection. Pathologic dilation of the 
airways  may  also  be  due  to  disease  of  the  surrounding  parenchyma. 
Because of the mechanical interdependence of the bronchial tree and 
parenchyma,  conditions  that  reduce  lung  compliance  may  result  in 
traction  bronchiectasis.  This  may  be  a  local  process  or  more  diffuse 
depending on the distribution of the underlying parenchymal disease, 
and likely provides further insight into disease severity.

The caliber of the central pulmonary arterial (PA) trunk proximal to 
its first bifurcation is directly related to pulmonary arterial pressure. A 
measure of >3 cm is suggestive of the presence of elevated pulmonary 
vascular pressures and more recent studies have demonstrated that an 
increased ratio of the PA diameter to the diameter of the adjacent aorta 
(PA/A) provides a metric of disease severity and in the case of chronic 
respiratory diseases such as COPD is prognostic for both acute respi-
ratory  exacerbations  and  death.  Assessment  of  the  intraparenchymal 
pulmonary vasculature is typically augmented through the intravenous

 ■ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/DEEP LEARNING
The  final  aspect  to  thoracic  imaging  that  must  be  discussed  is  the 
growing  field  of  artificial  intelligence  and  deep  learning  applied  to 
image  analysis.  Classic  machine  learning  approaches  to  medical 
image interpretation involve the development of advanced algorithms 
to  detect  structures  of  interest,  segment  their  boundaries,  and  then 
extract metrics related to size, shape, texture, etc. The massive increase 
in processing capacity afforded by graphical processing units (GPUs), 
the  increasing  availability  of  large  amounts  of  data,  and  the  wide 
dissemination  of  open-source  software  libraries  allowing  developers 
to create powerful work environments has led to explosive growth in 
the utilization of deep learning for image analytics. Some of the first 
medical applications of deep learning were in the field of dermatology 
and, more recently, this advanced form of pattern recognition has been 
reported to excel at the discrimination of benign and malignant lung 
nodules in thoracic CT scan. The breadth of application of these tools 
continues to expand to include image navigation and feature detection, 
biomarker  development,  and  direct  prediction  of  clinical  outcomes. 
An example of deep learning–enabled segmentation of the heart and 
pulmonary vasculature from noncontrast enhanced noncardiac gated 
CT scan is shown in Fig. 286-7.

TRANSTHORACIC NEEDLE ASPIRATION
Radiologically  guided  needle  biopsy  has  served  as  a  long-standing 
mechanism for evaluation of parenchymal lung lesions, both malignant 
and  infectious.  In  the  setting  of  published  guidelines  recommend-
ing  low-dose  screening  CT  scan  for  lung  malignancy  in  high-risk 
patients and with evolving guidelines for monitoring and assessment 
of incidental lung lesions arising in this setting, radiologically guided 
sampling of lung lesions has become an increasingly important mech-
anism  to  address  parenchymal  lung  abnormalities  concerning  for 
cancer.  Moreover,  as  novel  immune  modulators  and  biologic  agents 
are increasingly utilized for the management of systemic disease and 
transplantation,  effective  interventions  are  becoming  progressively 
more important in assessing for potential pulmonary infections arising 
as  complications  of  immune  suppression.  Transthoracic  needle  aspi-
ration (TTNA) remains one important arm in the assessment of these 
pulmonary complications.

TTNA can be accomplished with a variety of complementary imag-
ing  mechanisms,  including  under  fluoroscopic,  CT,  ultrasound,  or 
MRI  guidance.  CT  is  currently  the  most  common  imaging  modality 

infusion  or  bolus  of  iodinated  contrast.  This  bolus  and  subsequent 
image  acquisition  may  be  timed  to  visualize  passage  of  contrast 
through the pulmonary arteries to enable detection of thromboembolic 
disease, which appears as dark filling voids in otherwise bright white 
vessels.

It must be noted that the acquisition of CXRs and thoracic CT scans 
involves exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Several studies have 
estimated the excess numbers of cancer due to CT scanning and exten-
sive efforts have been made by both CT manufacturers and clinicians to 
reduce the radiation dose to the lowest possible amount that does not 
jeopardize image quality and interpretability.
 ■ MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
MRI  is  based  upon  the  behavior  of  protons  in  a  magnetic  field.  A 
strong magnetic field is applied to align the protons and then a pulse of 
radiofrequency current is then applied to the subject. This perturbs the 
protons and the speed at which they subsequently realign differs based 
upon the properties of the tissues within the region of interest. While 
this  technique  provides  exquisite  imaging  data  for  the  chest  wall  or 
solid organs such as the brain or heart, the abundance of air in the lung 
creates  an  artifact  that  impairs  direct  assessment  of  the  parenchyma. 
For this reason, MRI of the lung leverages intravenous contrast agents 
such  as  gadolinium  and  is  increasingly  exploring  the  use  of  inhaled 
agents such as hyperpolarized noble gas. These respective agents enable 
in  vivo  assessments  of  organ  perfusion  and  detailed  measures  of  the 
morphology of the distal airspaces. An example of noble gas–enhanced 
MRI is shown in Fig. 286-6. The inhaled agent is  3He and because it 
is proton rich, it can be used to examine lung ventilation visually and 
objectively. Regions of the lung that are poorly ventilated due to disease 
of the airways or distal airspaces have low concentrations of  3He and 
appear as dark regions in an otherwise bright blue organ.

While an MRI may have a longer acquisition time than CT, and the 
geometry of the equipment often leads to a sense of claustrophobia, it 
does not involve the administration of ionizing radiation. This makes 
it a modality of choice in the pediatric population or clinical situations 
where repeated assessments are required.
 ■ POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY
PET  generates  an  image  based  upon  the  aggregation  of  radiola-
beled  tracers.  The  most  common  agent  used  for  these  purposes  is 
[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose  (FDG).  This  radiolabeled  glucose  ana-
logue is administered intravenously and is taken up by cells in direct 
proportion to their metabolic activity. In the clinical setting, it is most 
commonly used for the discrimination of benign and malignant lung 
nodules,  as  well  as  lung  cancer  staging.  Given  the  relatively  low  res-
olution  of  PET,  co-registration  with  CT  is  common  and  the  aligned 
imaging modalities allow the reader to determine the structural source 
of heightened metabolic activity.

There is increasing interest in the use of PET imaging in the biomed-
ical community. These applications are largely still confined to research 
but advances in areas such as in vivo assessments of vascular biology in 
acute and chronic disease have been impressive.

2146 used to assess parenchymal lung lesions, with sensitivity and specificity 
reported to be >90%. Sensitivity of CT-guided TTNA is increased in 
more peripheral lesions. Transthoracic ultrasound has the advantages 
of a low complication rate in the setting of fine needle aspiration (FNA) 
and portability, allowing for more logistical simplicity in the setting of 
lung  lesion  assessment.  In  a  prospective  study  of  ultrasound-guided 
percutaneous  FNA  compared  with  CT-guided  FNA,  diagnostic  rates 
were  comparable  between  the  two  groups,  with  shorter  procedure 
time  associated  with  ultrasound  guidance,  numerical  suggestion  of 
decreased  complication  rate  using  ultrasound  guidance,  and  lower 
costs associated with ultrasound guidance. Use of elastography to bet-
ter characterize lung lesions has also been proposed in the context of 
ultrasound, though additional diagnostic yield has not yet been proven. 
Color  Doppler  ultrasonographic  imaging  has  been  demonstrated  to 
have a high sensitivity and specificity and a low complication rate in 
another study. Electromagnetic guidance, unlike CT imaging, can be 
used  in  combination  with  endobronchial  ultrasound  and  or  naviga-
tional bronchoscopy in the operative setting, theoretically allowing for 
a multimodal approach that could increase diagnostic yield and allow 
for  a  combined  staging  procedure.  Electromagnetic  TTNA  alone  has 
demonstrated an 83% diagnostic yield in a pilot study, with an increase 
to  87%  when  combined  with  navigational  bronchoscopy.  Conflict-
ing  data  are  available  regarding  the  diagnostic  superiority  of  TTNA 
compared  with  alternative  biopsy  modalities  such  as  endobronchial 
ultrasound  for  diagnosis  of  lung  lesions,  and  results  may  depend  on 
center experience.

Transthoracic sampling can be obtained using FNA or core needle 
biopsy. In one retrospective study, FNA was found to have an inferior 
diagnostic rate, compared with core needle sampling, as well as lower 
specificity. In this study, a method involving two FNA passes was com-
pared  to  core  needle  sampling  with  six  cores  obtained  from  a  single 
pass.  No  significant  differences  in  complication  rates  were  noted.  In 
another  retrospective  study,  in  which  procedure  was  determined  by 
operator preferences, core needle aspirate samples were more likely to 
provide sufficient material for molecular testing than FNA. A system-
atic review of these techniques concluded that insufficient evidence was 
available to support a difference between FNA and core needle biopsy in 
diagnostic efficiency, though core needle biopsy may be more specific 
in diagnosing benign lung lesions. Given the negative predictive value 
estimate  of  70%,  negative  results  from  TTNA  are  less  reliable  than 
positive results and should not be considered definitive to eliminate the 
concern for malignancy. Further assessment is needed to directly com-
pare  imaging  modalities  for  TTNA  guidance  and  to  compare  TTNA 
with  other  diagnostic  modalities  to  determine  the  optimal  choice  of 
procedure in particular settings. Choice of procedure should be consid-
ered in the context of the size and location of the lesion, the experience 
of the center and operator, and patient-specific factors.

In  regards  to  the  safety  of  TTNA,  in  a  retrospective  study  from 
2015,  the  presence  of  mild  to  moderate  pulmonary  hypertension  in 
patients  did  not  increase  complication  rates  in  the  setting  of  TTNA. 
The complication rates noted in this report were substantial, however, 
with  hemorrhage  occurring  in  one-third  to  one-quarter  of  patients, 
and  pneumothorax  in  17–28%.  The  majority  of  pneumothoraces 
did  not  require  chest  tube  placement.  Other  complications  included 
hemoptysis  and  hemothorax,  though  these  were  uncommon.  These 
complication rates are consistent with those reported in other studies. 
In a meta-analysis of complication rates of CT-guided TTNA, compli-
cation rates were higher with core needle aspirates than FNA (38.8% 
[95% CI 34.3–43.5%] vs 24% [95% CI 18.2–30.8%]). The majority of 
these  complications  were  minor.  Risk  factors  for  complications  with 
FNA  included  smaller  nodule  diameter,  larger  needle  diameter,  and 
increased traversed lung parenchyma. No clear risk factors were noted 
for complications after core needle biopsies in this publication. More 
generally, the risks of TTNA increase for more centrally located lesions 
and those residing in close proximity to intrathoracic vasculature.

Despite the outstanding questions regarding the optimal approach 
for TTNA, this modality has been shown to be effective in cancer diag-
nosis in the thorax. Adenocarcinoma has become the most prevalent 
parenchymal lung malignancy in reported studies, and also the most 

common malignant diagnosis found on TTNA of the lung. TTNA can 
also be effective in diagnosing less common tumors of the lung, both 
malignant and benign, including squamous and small cell carcinomas, 
lymphomas,  and  others,  as  well  as  in  assessing  tumors  of  the  medi-
astinum.  The  diagnostic  utility  of  TTNA  is  consistent  across  solid, 
subsolid,  and  partially  calcified  lung  nodules.  Immunocytochemistry 
markers  can  be  utilized  in  TTNA  samples  to  assist  with  diagnosis, 
prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy, and samples should 
be preserved whenever possible to allow for these studies, if needed. 
RNA extraction has also proven feasible in the setting of a single FNA 
sample,  which  could  be  instrumental  in  gene  expression  profiling, 
though  this  has  thus  far  only  been  successfully  accomplished  in  a 
research context.

The utility of TTNA in diagnosing pulmonary infections is variable 
in  published  literature.  Some  publications  have  reported  that  TTNA 
establishes a diagnosis of infection in 60–70% of cases, with a particu-
larly high yield in the setting of Aspergillus infections. TTNA has also 
been shown to be particularly effective in the diagnosis of pulmonary 
tuberculosis, though a wide variety of infections have been diagnosed 
using  this  method.  The  presence  of  necrosis  in  lung  lesions  makes 
establishing an infectious diagnosis more likely using TTNA. Numer-
ous staining techniques are available to assist with infectious diagnoses, 
and immunohistochemistry can also aid in the diagnosis of infection. 
Cytology should be correlated with histopathology and culture results, 
when  available.  Metagenomics  using  next-generation  sequencing  for 
detection of infection is evolving but requires further study. TTNA has 
also  been  useful  in  identifying  granulomatous  inflammation,  which 
can provide supportive evidence of a granulomatous parenchymal lung 
disease in the appropriate clinical setting.

In  summary,  TTNA  is  an  important  element  of  diagnostic  algo-
rithms  in  the  setting  of  lung  nodules  and  masses,  particularly  when 
concern  for  malignancy  is  not  high  enough  to  warrant  immediate 
excision, when the patient is not a surgical candidate, or the lesion or 
disease is not amenable to surgical resection. Further study is needed, 
however, to better understand the role of TTNA and other diagnostic 
modalities in the evaluation of parenchymal lung lesions.

MISCELLANEOUS TESTING
 ■ SPUTUM TESTING
Sputum  microscopy  and  culture  are  commonly  utilized  to  diagnose 
respiratory  tract  infections  and  identify  the  causative  organisms.  In 
patients  with  productive  cough  the  sampling  is  simple  and  nonin-
vasive,  however,  subject  to  patient  technique  and  the  potential  for 
oropharyngeal and/or upper respiratory tract contamination. In those 
who are not expectorating, sputum induction can be considered using 
provocative nebulization with saline. Numerous studies have attempted 
to define criteria for reliability and reproducibility of sputum samples. 
The majority include quantification of number of epithelial cells and 
white blood cells per low power field, and many assess the ratio of the 
two for adequacy of sampling. None has been confirmed as superior 
in  establishing  the  reliability  of  sampling  to  reflect  lower  respiratory 
tract  growth.  The  quality  of  the  sputum  sample  directly  impacts  the 
diagnostic reliability in the setting of bacterial pneumonia. Growth of 
Mycobaterium  tuberculosis,  Legionella,  or  pneumocystis  should  raise 
concern for infection, even in the setting of a poor sample. Endotra-
cheal  aspirates  have  not  been  demonstrated  to  be  clearly  superior  to 
expectorated sputum in terms of diagnostic reliability, but such sam-
pling may be required if spontaneous coughing is nonproductive and 
induced sputum is not feasible or successful.

As  in  the  context  of  infection,  sputum  cytologic  analysis  has  been 
utilized  to  assist  in  the  diagnosis  of  malignancy,  mainly  because  it 
can be obtained noninvasively. While sputum cytology demonstrating 
malignant cells is highly specific for a diagnosis of lung malignancy, its 
sensitivity has been reported at <40%. A systematic review of screening 
methods demonstrated no added benefit from sputum cytology when 
combined  with  CXR  to  screen  for  lung  cancer.  Advanced  molecular 
techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, DNA methylation mark-
ers,  micro-RNA  assessment,  and  tumor-related  protein  analysis  have 

HPIM21e_Part7_p2131-p2216.indd   2146

20/01/22   6:20 PM

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systembeen proposed in sputum assessment for diagnostic purposes and risk 
stratification.  At  present,  however,  sputum  cytology  is  recommended 
only  when  more  invasive  techniques  cannot  be  pursued,  such  as  in 
patients with prohibitive comorbidities or in resource-limited settings.

 ■ EXHALED BREATH CONDENSATE
Exhaled  breath  condensate  includes  gaseous,  liquid,  and  water-soluble 
components,  with  numerous  biomarker  types  and  collection  system 
varieties developed over time. Validation standards for many compo-
nents are still being determined. Exhaled nitric oxide is the most highly 
validated  of  the  biomarkers  identified  in  exhaled  breath  condensate. 
The  fraction  of  exhaled  nitric  oxide  (FeNO)  has  been  demonstrated 
in  higher  concentrations  in  exhaled  breath  condensate  of  patients 
with asthma than in healthy individuals, and has been shown in some 
studies to correlate with the presence of eosinophils in the sputum and 
blood  and  with  response  to  inhaled  corticosteroids,  though  data  are 
conflicting.  For  example,  in  a  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis, 
FeNO elevation increased the odds of having asthma in both children 
above  the  age  of  5  years  and  adults.  In  another  systematic  review 
of  FeNO  utilization  in  the  management  of  adults  with  asthma,  the 
assessment  was  helpful  in  the  management  of  severe  exacerbations 
but had no significant impact on overall exacerbations or inhaled cor-
ticosteroid  use.  Moreover,  evidence  suggests  that  tailoring  of  asthma 
therapy based on sputum eosinophil levels was effective in decreasing 
asthma  exacerbations,  but  tailoring  of  therapy  based  on  FeNO  was 
not  beneficial  in  improving  outcomes,  and  insufficient  evidence  was 
observed to advocate the use of either sputum analysis or FeNO in clin-
ical practice. FeNO has also been shown to be influenced by ethnicity, 
and  appropriate  reference  standards  for  different  ethnic  groups  have 
yet  to  be  established.  While  FeNO  has  been  proposed  as  a  potential 
clinical guide to management, its use has not been incorporated into 
all guideline recommendations, and it has not been formally approved 
for clinical use.

 ■ SWEAT TESTING
Assessment of chloride concentration in sweat using pilocarpine ion-
topheresis,  or  sweat  testing,  remains  a  key  element  in  the  diagnostic 
framework of cystic fibrosis (CF). This method utilizes pilocarpine to 
stimulate sweat production. As patients with CF suffer from alterations 
to  the  sodium  chloride  ion  channel,  measurement  of  electrolytes  in 
their secretions such as sweat reveals elevated chloride concentrations, 
amongst  other  abnormalities.  This  testing  has  been  considered  the 
gold standard in the diagnosis of CF due to its functional nature, its 
relative noninvasiveness, the establishment of validated standards for 
its performance, and its ability to discriminate between healthy indi-
viduals and those with CF at a chloride concentration of ≥60 mmol/L. 
The likelihood of a diagnosis of CF at a concentration of <40 mmol/L 
has been observed to be low, and an indeterminate range was defined 
as 40–59 mmol/L, which could be consistent with the disease if genetic 
and clinical manifestations were supportive.

While functional testing such as sweat chloride testing remains an 
essential component of diagnostic algorithms in CF, the evolution of 
genetic analysis has led to identification of an extensive array of genetic 
mutations  associated  with  varied  phenotypic  impacts  in  this  disease. 
In  this  context,  the  indeterminate  range  of  chloride  concentrations 
of  40–59  mmol/L  on  sweat  test  analysis  was  found  to  inadequately 
identify milder or more heterogenous forms of the disease associated 
with newly identified genetic mutations. As a result, the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation provided updated guidance for the interpretation of sweat 
test results, with a decreased lower threshold to define an intermedi-
ate range of chloride concentration (changed from 40–50 mmol/L to 
30–50 mmol/L), which could be consistent with the diagnosis of CF in 
the appropriate genetic and clinical context. In a subsequent analysis, 
utilization of the new guidance was found to enhance the probability 
of  identifying  patients  with  CF  without  increasing  the  false-positive 
diagnosis rate in the population. Sweat testing is a critical component 
of the CF diagnostic algorithm but should be interpreted in the context 
of clinical manifestations of disease and correlated with genetic testing 
in those suspected of the diagnosis.

 ■ ALLERGY TESTING
Allergy testing is often considered in the assessment of environmental 
exposures, including seasonal allergens, food allergens, and drug aller-
gens. In the case of drug allergens in particular, drug reactions are often 
reported  based  on  remote  history  and  are  often  unconfirmed.  The 
hesitancy to re-expose patients with an unconfirmed drug allergy can 
lead to limited options for treatment, to delay in treatment, and to uti-
lization of treatments with more extended spectrum, potentially influ-
encing the resistance patterns of these agents. Drug reactions can be 
mediated by IgE (immediate type reactions, type I), IgG or IgM (type 
II), immune complex reactions (type III), and delayed-type hypersen-
sitivity reactions mediated by cellular immune mechanisms (type IV).
Skin testing, including patch testing and/or delayed intradermal test-
ing, is available to test exposure to particular allergens and determine 
reactivity. These tests have been shown to aid in clinical phenotyping 
of type I reactions and potentially in type IV reactions, though their 
role in type IV assessment remains more controversial. In the context 
of suspected type I reactions, patch testing is more cost effective and 
may be as effective as intradermal testing in identifying potential caus-
ative agents. The negative predictive value of intradermal skin testing 
in assessing for IgE-mediated drug allergies is high; however, the high 
sensitivity of this testing limits its specificity, and results must be inter-
preted in the context of the pretest probability and the clinical expe-
rience of the patient. Skin tests have also been demonstrated to assist 
in  identifying  the  causative  agent  in  type  IV  reactions  and  to  assess 
cross-reactivity between structurally related drugs. Intradermal testing 
may  be  more  sensitive  than  patch  testing  to  assess  for  type  IV  drug 
reactions. Though some debate continues regarding a mandatory role 
for skin testing in the assessment of potential drug allergies, drug prov-
ocation testing or rechallenge is generally regarded as safe in low-risk 
individuals with history of urticaria or immediate rash, whereas skin 
testing has been proposed as a preliminary assessment in higher-risk 
individuals  with  a  history  of  two  or  more  reactions,  angioedema,  or 
anaphylaxis, prior to consideration of drug provocation testing.

287 Asthma

Elliot Israel

Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic airway obstruction and 
airway  hyperresponsiveness  usually  accompanied  by  airway  inflam-
mation.  In  most  cases,  the  airway  obstruction  is  reversible,  but  in  a 
subset  of  asthmatics,  a  component  of  the  obstruction  may  become 
irreversible. In a large proportion of patients, the airway inflammation 

HPIM21e_Part7_p2131-p2216.indd   2147

2148 is eosinophilic, but some patients may present with differing types of 
airway inflammation, and in some cases, there is no obvious evidence 
of airway inflammation.

MANIFESTATIONS
Asthma  most  frequently  presents  as  episodic  shortness  of  breath, 
wheezing, and cough, which can occur in relation to triggers but may 
also occur spontaneously. These symptoms can occur in combination 
or  separately.  Other  symptoms  can  include  chest  tightness  and/or 
mucus production. These symptoms can resolve spontaneously or with 
therapy. In some patients, wheezing and/or dyspnea can be persistent. 
Episodes  of  acute  bronchospasm,  known  as  exacerbations,  may  be 
severe  enough  to  require  emergency  medical  care  or  hospitalization 
and may result in death.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Asthma  is  the  most  common  chronic  disease  associated  with  sig-
nificant  morbidity  and  mortality,  with  ~241  million  people  affected 
globally.  Cross-sectional  studies  suggest  that  7.9%  of  the  population 
in the United States suffers from asthma as compared to ~4.3% prev-
alence  worldwide.  Prevalence  continues  to  increase  (starting  at  7.3% 
in  2001  in  the  United  States)  and  is  associated  with  transition  from 
rural to urban living. Asthma is more prevalent among children (8.4%) 
than adults (7.7%). In children, the prevalence is greatest among boys 
(2:1 male-to-female ratio), with a trend toward greater prevalence in 
women in adulthood. In some patients, asthma resolves as they enter 
adulthood only to “recur” later in life.

In the United States in 2016, 1.8 million people visited an emergency 
department for asthma, and 189,000 were hospitalized. The total eco-
nomic cost in the United States in 2007 was estimated at $56 billion. In 
the United States, asthma is more prevalent in blacks than Caucasians, 
and black race is associated with greater case morbidity. The ethnicity 
with  the  greatest  prevalence  in  the  United  States  is  the  Puerto  Rican 
population.

Asthma  mortality  increased  worldwide  in  the  1960s,  apparently 
related to overuse of inhaled β2-agonists. Reduction in mortality since 
then  has  been  attributed  to  increased  use  of  inhaled  corticosteroids. 
Asthma  mortality  declined  globally  from  0.44  per  100,000  people 
in  1993  to  0.19  in  2006,  but  further  reduction  in  mortality  has  not 
occurred since that time.

THE PATHWAY TO THE DEVELOPMENT  
OF ASTHMA
The  pathway  to  development  of  asthma  can  be  varied.  As  illustrated 
in Fig. 287-1, there is an interplay between genetic susceptibility (see 
below)  and  environmental  exposure  and  endogenous  developmental 
factors  (e.g.,  aging  and  menopause  [see  “Etiologic  Mechanisms  and 
Risk Factors” and Table 287-1]) that can lead to the development of 
asthma. Continued or additional exposures and triggers (Table 287-2) 
can affect the progression of disease and the degree of impairment.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 ■ MECHANISMS LEADING TO ACUTE AND  
CHRONIC AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION
The  pathobiologic  processes  in  the  airways  that  lead  to  episodic  and 
chronic airway obstruction of asthma are discussed below. Their patho-
logic correlates are highlighted in Fig. 287-2, illustrating the pathologic 
changes that can occur in asthmatic airways. These processes can occur 
individually  or  simultaneously.  There  can  be  temporal  variation  of 
these processes in an individual based on exogenous factors, discussed 
later in this chapter, as well as the aging process itself. These processes 
can involve the entire airway (but not the parenchyma), but there can 
be  significant  spatial  heterogeneity,  as  has  now  been  demonstrated 
using hyperpolarized gas ventilation studies and high-resolution com-
puted tomography (CT) of the thorax.

Airway  Hyperresponsiveness  Airway  hyperresponsiveness  is  a 
hallmark of asthma. It is defined as an acute narrowing response of the 
airways in reaction to agents that do not elicit airway responses in non-
affected individuals or an excess narrowing response to inhaled agents 
as compared to that which would occur in nonaffected individuals. A 

component of the hyperresponsiveness occurs at the level of the airway 
smooth muscle itself as demonstrated by hyperresponsiveness to direct 
smooth-muscle–acting  agents  such  as  histamine  or  methacholine.  In 
many  patients,  the  apparent  hyperresponsiveness  is  due  to  indirect 
activation of airway narrowing mechanisms as a result of stimulation 
of  inflammatory  cells  (which  release  direct  bronchoconstrictors  and 
mediators  that  cause  airway  edema  and/or  mucus  secretion)  and/
or  stimulation  of  sensory  nerves  that  can  act  on  the  smooth  muscle 
or  inflammatory  cells.  Agents  and  physical  stimuli  that  elicit  such 
responses are discussed later.

The  apparent  increased  responsiveness  of  the  airways  in  asthma 
may also have a structural etiology. In asthma, airway wall thickness 
is  associated  with  disease  severity  and  duration.  This  thickening, 
which may result from a combination of smooth-muscle hypertrophy 
and  hyperplasia,  subepithelial  collagen  deposition,  airway  edema, 
and mucosal inflammation, can result in a tendency for the airway to 
narrow disproportionately in response to stimuli that elicit increased 
airway muscle tension. A major therapeutic objective in asthma is to 
decrease the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness.

airway, the right represents an asthmatic airway highlighting the pathologic changes that can be seen in asthma. The asthmatic airway lumen is reduced by smooth-muscle 
constriction, mucus in the airway lumen, and thickening of the submucosa due to edema and cellular infiltration. In addition, the ability of the lumen to increase in size with 
smooth-muscle relaxation may be impaired by deposition of collagen. The epithelium is disrupted, and there is evidence of vascular and neuronal proliferation. All these 
changes may not be present in one individual, and certain patients may have normal-appearing airways.

2150 Inflammatory  Cells  While  airway  inflammation  can  be  precipi-
tated by acute exposure to inhalants, most asthmatics have evidence of 
chronic inflammation in the airways. Most commonly, this inflamma-
tion is eosinophilic in nature. In some patients, neutrophilic inflamma-
tion may be predominant, especially in those with more severe asthma. 
Mast cells are also more frequent. Many inflammatory cells are present 
in an activated state, as will be discussed in the section on inflammation.

Airway  Smooth  Muscle  Airway  smooth  muscle  can  contribute 
to asthma in three ways. First, it can be hyperresponsive to stimuli, as 
noted above. Second, hypertrophy and hyperplasia can lead to airway 
wall thickening with consequences for hyperresponsiveness, as noted 
above.  Lastly,  airway  smooth-muscle  cells  can  produce  chemokines 
and  cytokines  that  promote  airway  inflammation  and  promote  the 
survival of inflammatory cells, particularly mast cells.

Subepithelial  Collagen  Deposition  and  Matrix  Deposition  
Thickening of the subepithelial basement membrane occurs as a result 
of deposition of repair-type collagens and tenascin, periostin, fibronec-
tin, and osteopontin primarily from myofibroblasts under the epithe-
lium. The deposition of collagen and matrix stiffens the airway and can 
result  in  exaggerated  responses  to  increased  circumferential  tension 
exerted  by  the  smooth  muscle.  Such  deposition  can  also  narrow  the 
airway lumen and decrease its ability to relax and thus can contribute 
to chronic airway obstruction.

Airway Epithelium  Airway epithelium disruption takes the form 
of  separation  of  columnar  cells  from  the  basal  cells.  The  damaged 
epithelium is hypothesized to form a trophic unit with the underlying 
mesenchyme.  This  unit  elaborates  multiple  growth  factors  thought 
to contribute to airway remodeling as well as multiple cytokines and 
mediators that promote asthmatic airway inflammation.

Vascular Proliferation 
In a subset of asthmatics, there is a signifi-
cant degree of angiogenesis thought to be secondary to elaboration of 
angiogenic factors in the context of airway inflammation. Inflamma-
tory mediators can result in leakage from postcapillary venules, which 
can contribute to the acute and chronic edema of the airways.

Airway  Edema  Submucosal  edema  can  be  present  as  an  acute 
response in asthma and as a chronic contributor to airway wall thickening.

Epithelial  Goblet  Cell  Metaplasia  and  Mucus  Hypersecretion  
Chronic inflammation can result in the appearance and proliferation 
of  mucus  cells.  Increased  mucus  production  can  reduce  the  effective 
airway luminal area. Mucus plugs can obstruct medium-size airways 
and can extend into the small airways.

Neuronal  Proliferation  Neurotrophins,  which  can  lead  to 
neuronal  proliferation,  are  elaborated  by  smooth-muscle  cells,  epi-
thelial  cells,  and  inflammatory  cells.  Neuronal  inputs  can  regulate 
smooth-muscle tone and mucus production, which may mediate acute 
bronchospasm and potentially chronically increased airway tone.
 ■ AIRWAY INFLAMMATION (TYPE 2 AND NON–TYPE 
2 INFLAMMATION)
Most  asthma  is  accompanied  by  airway  inflammation.  In  the  past, 
asthma  had  been  divided  into  atopic  and  nonatopic  (or  intrinsic) 
asthma.  The  former  was  identified  as  relating  to  allergen  sensitivity 
and exposure, with production of IgE, and occurring more commonly 
in children. The latter was identified as occurring in individuals with 
later onset asthma, with or without allergies, but frequently with eos-
inophilia. This paradigm is being superseded by a nosology that favors 
consideration of whether asthma is associated with type 2 or non–type 
2 inflammation. This approach to immunologic classification is driven 
by  a  developing  understanding  of  the  underlying  immune  processes 
and by the development of therapeutic approaches that target type 2 
inflammation (see later sections on asthma therapy).

Type  2  Inflammation  Type  2  inflammation  is  an  immune 
response involving the innate and adaptive arms of the immune sys-
tem to promote barrier immunity on mucosal surfaces. It is called type 

2 because it is associated with the type 2 subset of CD4+ T-helper cells, 
which  produce  the  cytokines  interleukin  (IL)  4,  IL-5,  and  IL-13.  As 
shown in Fig. 287-3, these cytokines can have pleiotropic effects. IL-4 
induces  B-cell  isotype  switching  to  production  of  IgE.  IgE,  through 
its binding to basophils and mast cells, results in environmental sen-
sitivity to allergens as a result of cross-linking of IgE on the surface of 
these mast cells and basophils. The products released from these cells 
include type 2 cytokines as well as direct activators of smooth-muscle 
constriction and edema. IL-5 has a critical role in regulating eosino-
phils.  It  controls  formation,  recruitment,  and  survival  of  these  cells. 
IL-13 induces airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus hypersecretion, and 
goblet cell metaplasia. While allergen exposure in allergic individuals 
can  elicit  a  cascade  of  activation  of  type  2  inflammation,  it  is  now 
understood  (see  Fig.  287-3)  that  nonallergic  stimuli  can  elicit  pro-
duction of type 2 cytokines, particularly due to stimulation of type 2 
innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). These cells can produce IL-5 and IL-13.  
ILC2s  can  be  activated  by  epithelial  cytokines  known  as  alarmins, 
which are produced in response to “nonallergic” epithelial exposures 
such as irritants, pollutants, oxidative agents, fungi, or viruses. Thus, 
these “nonallergic” stimuli can be associated with eosinophilia.

The development of anti–IL-5 drugs that dramatically reduce eos-
inophils  has  allowed  us  to  determine  that,  in  many  asthmatics,  eos-
inophils play a major role in asthma pathobiology. They may induce 
hyperresponsiveness  through  release  of  oxidative  radicals  and  major 
basic protein, which can disrupt the epithelium. In addition, recent CT 
imaging has suggested that mucus plugs, which may contain significant 
amounts of eosinophil aggregates, may accumulate in the airways and 
contribute to asthma severity.

Non–Type 2 Processes  As shown in Fig. 287-2, multiple processes 
can contribute to airway narrowing and apparent airway hyperrespon-
siveness.  While  type  2  inflammatory  processes  are  most  common, 
non–type 2 processes can exist either in combination with type 2 inflam-
mation or without type 2 inflammation. Neutrophilic inflammation, as 
shown in Fig. 287-3, can also occur. This type of inflammation is more 
commonly seen in severe asthma that has not responded to the common 
anti-inflammatory  therapies,  such  as  corticosteroids,  that  usually  sup-
press type 2 inflammation. In some cases, it may also be associated with 
chronic  infection,  occasionally  with  atypical  pathogens  such  as  Myco-
plasma, perhaps accounting for the response of some of these patients 
to  macrolide  antibiotics.  It  is  also  commonly  seen  in  reactive  airway 
dysfunction syndrome (see “Etiologic Mechanisms and Risk Factors”).

In  a  small  subset  of  asthmatics,  the  pathologic  changes  seen  in 
Fig.  287-2  may  occur  without  any  evidence  of  tissue  infiltration  by 
inflammatory  cells.  The  etiology  of  such  pauci-granulocytic  asthma 
is unclear.
 ■ MEDIATORS
Many  chemical  substances  or  signaling  factors  can  contribute  to  the 
pathobiologic picture of asthma. Some of them have been successfully 
targeted in developing asthma therapies.

Cytokines  As illustrated in Fig. 287-3, and as discussed above, IL-4, 
IL-5, and IL-13 are the major cytokines associated with type 2 inflam-
mation. They have all been targeted successfully in asthma therapies. 
Thymic  stromal  lymphopoietin  (TSLP),  IL-25,  and  IL-33  also  play  a 
role in the signaling cascade and are being actively studied as targets 
for treatment of asthma. IL-9 has been implicated as well. IL-6, IL-17, 
tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and IL-8 have been implicated 
in non–type 2 inflammation.

Fatty  Acid  Mediators  Proinflammatory  mediators  derived  from 
arachidonic acid include leukotrienes and prostaglandins. The cystei-
nyl leukotrienes (leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4) are produced by eosin-
ophils  and  mast  cells.  They  are  potent  smooth-muscle  constrictors. 
They  also  stimulate  mucus  secretion,  recruit  allergic  inflammatory 
cells, cause microvascular leakage, modulate cytokine production, and 
influence  neural  transmission.  Cysteinyl  leukotriene  modifiers  have 
shown clinical benefit in asthma. The non-cysteinyl leukotriene, LTB4, 
is  produced  primarily  from  neutrophils  but  can  also  be  synthesized

by  macrophages  and  epithelial  cells.  It  is  a  potent  neutrophil  che-
moattractant.  Prostaglandins  are  for  the  most  part  proinflammatory. 
Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is produced by mast cells. Receptors for PGD2 
(CRTH2 receptors) are present on TH2 cells, ILC2 cells, mast cells, eos-
inophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells, and the activation of these 
receptors  upregulates  type  2  inflammation.  Initial  studies  with  drugs 
blocking CRTH2 have shown mild to moderate effectiveness in asthma.
There  are  several  classes  of  fatty  acid–derived  mediators  that  are 
responsible  for  the  resolution  of  inflammation.  These  include  the 
resolvins and lipoxins. Several studies suggest that deficiencies in these 
moieties may be responsible for the ongoing inflammation in asthma, 
especially in severe asthma.
Nitric Oxide  Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator, and in vitro stud-
ies suggest that it can increase mucus production and smooth-muscle 
proliferation. It is produced by epithelial cells, especially in response 
to IL-13, and by stimulated inflammatory cells including eosinophils, 
mast cells, and neutrophils. Its precise role in the asthmatic diathesis 
is  unclear.  However,  its  production  is  increased  in  the  airways  in 
the  presence  of  asthmatic  eosinophilic  inflammation,  and  it  can  be 
detected in exhaled breath.
Reactive  Oxygen  Species  When  allergens,  pollutants,  bacteria, 
and viruses activate inflammatory cells in the airway, they induce respi-
ratory bursts that release reactive oxygen species that result in oxidative 
stress in the surrounding tissue. Increases in oxidative stress have been 

shown to affect smooth-muscle contraction, increase mucus secretion, 
produce airway hyperresponsiveness, and result in epithelial shedding.
Chemokines  A variety of chemokines are secreted by the epithe-
lium  (as  well  as  other  inflammatory  cells)  and  attract  inflammatory 
cells into the airways. Those of particular interest include eotaxin (an 
eosinophil  chemoattractant),  TARC  and  MDC  (which  attract  TH2 
cells), and RANTES (which has pluripotent pro-phlogistic effects).
ETIOLOGIC MECHANISMS, RISK FACTORS, 
TRIGGERS, AND COMPLICATING 
COMORBIDITIES
As  illustrated  in  Fig.  287-1,  the  development  of  asthma  involves  an 
interplay  between  risk  factors  and  exposures  (see  Table  287-1)  and 
genetic predisposition.
 ■ HERITABLE PREDISPOSITION
Asthma  has  a  strong  genetic  predisposition.  Family  and  twin  studies 
suggest a 25–80% degree of heritability. Genetic studies suggest complex 
polygenic inheritance complicated by interaction with environmental 
exposures. Further, epigenetic modifications related to environmental 
exposures  may  also  produce  heritable  patterns  of  asthma.  Many  of 
the genes related to asthma have been associated with risk for atopy. 
However, there appear to be genetic modifications that predispose to 
asthma  and  its  severity.  Association  studies  have  identified  multiple 
candidate  genes.  In  many  cases,  these  genes  vary  from  population 

HPIM21e_Part7_p2131-p2216.indd   2151

20/01/22   6:20 PM

 
2152 to  population.  The  most  consistently  identified  include  ORMDL3/
GSDMB (in the 17q21 chromosomal region), ADAM33, DPP-10, TSLP, 
IL-12, IL-33, ST2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQB2, TLR1, and IL6R. In many 
cases, association studies have identified polymorphisms in noncoding 
regions  of  the  genome,  suggesting  that  the  majority  of  the  currently 
identified traits act as “enhancers” of biologic processes.

Genetic polymorphisms have also been associated with differential 
responses to asthma therapies. Variants in the β-receptor (Arg16Gly in 
ADRB2), the glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 gene, and genes in the 
leukotriene synthesis and receptor pathways have been associated with 
altered response to the pharmacologic agents acting at those receptors 
or through those pathways.

While  genetic  variation  plays  a  key  role  in  asthma  susceptibility, 
it is important to understand that unraveling the complexities of the 
genetic  contribution  to  asthma  remains  elusive.  To  wit,  only  2.5%  of 
asthma  risk  can  be  explained  by  the  31  single  nucleotide  polymor-
phisms that have been associated with asthma.

A significant proportion of the heritability of asthma relates to the 
heritability  of  atopy.  Atopy  is  the  genetic  tendency  toward  specific 
IgE  production  in  response  to  allergen  exposure.  Serum  levels  of 
IgE  correlate  closely  with  the  development  of  asthma.  The  National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III found that 
half of asthma in patients aged 6–59 could be attributed to atopy with 
evidence of allergic sensitization. The allergens most associated with 
risk include house dust mites, indoor fungi, cockroaches, and indoor 
animals.

 ■ EXPOSURES AND RISK FACTORS
Allergic  Sensitization  and  Allergen  Exposure  Like  asthma, 
the development of allergic sensitization involves an interplay between 
heritable susceptibility and allergen exposure. Allergen exposure dur-
ing vulnerable developmental periods is believed to increase the risk of 
development of allergic sensitization in those with a tendency toward 
atopy.  Allergic  sensitization  is  increased  in  industrialized  nations. 
Recent research has suggested that varied microbiome exposure (expo-
sure to bacteria and bacterial products) may influence the development 
of atopy with decreased risk for atopy in those in rural environments. 
Studies  of  the  role  of  early  allergen  avoidance  in  reducing  the  risk 
of  developing  asthma  have  produced  contradictory  results,  possibly 
related to the inability to eliminate all allergen exposure.

Tobacco  Maternal  smoking  and  secondhand  smoke  exposure  are 
associated  with  increased  childhood  asthma.  Childhood  secondhand 
smoke  exposure  increased  asthma  risk  twofold.  Active  smoking  is 
estimated to increase the incidence of asthma by up to fourfold in ado-
lescents and young adults.

Air Pollution  Early life exposure to pollution increases the risk of 
development of asthma. Proximity to major roadways increases the risk 
of early childhood asthma, thought to be attributed to levels of nitro-
gen dioxide exposure. Decreasing nitrogen dioxide exposure has been 
found  to  decrease  asthma  incidence  in  children.  Studies  of  exposure 
to mixed pollutants suggest that most risk lies with carbon monoxide 
and nitric dioxide, with marginal effects of sulfur dioxide. Indoor air 
pollution  from  open  fires  and  use  of  gas  stoves  has  been  associated 
with  increased  risk  of  children  developing  asthma  symptoms.  Mech-
anistically, pollutants are thought to cause oxidative injury to the air-
ways, producing airway inflammation and leading to remodeling and 
increased risk of airway sensitization.

Infections  Respiratory  infections  clearly  can  precipitate  asthma 
deteriorations. However, the degree to which respiratory infections indi-
cate susceptibility to asthma, represent a causal factor, or in some cases 
provide protection from asthma is unclear. Incidence and frequency of 
human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infections in children 
are  associated  with  development  of  asthma,  but  whether  they  play  a 
causal role is unclear. Evidence of prior Mycoplasma pneumoniae infec-
tion has been associated with the development of asthma in Taiwanese 
adults.

Occupational  Exposures  Occupational  asthma  is  estimated  to 
account  for  10–25%  of  adult-onset  asthma.  The  occupations  associ-
ated  with  the  most  cases  in  European  Community  Health  Surveys 
were nursing and cleaning. Two types of exposures are recognized: (1) 
an  immunologic  stimulus  (further  subdivided  into  high-molecular- 
weight  [e.g.,  proteins,  flour]  and  low-molecular-weight  [e.g.,  formal-
dehyde, diisocyanate] stimuli based on whether they act as haptens or 
can directly stimulate a response), and (2) an irritative stimulus. The 
immunologic form is associated with a latency period between time of 
exposure  and  development  of  symptoms.  The  irritative  form,  known 
as  reactive  airway  dysfunction  syndrome  (RADS),  will  be  discussed 
below. A combination of genetic predisposition (including atopy), tim-
ing, intensity of exposure, and co-exposure (e.g., smoking) influences 
whether an individual will develop occupational asthma.

Diet  There  are  suggestions  that  prenatal  diet  or  vitamin  defi-
ciency may  alter  the  risk  of  developing  asthma.  The  evidence  is  not 
yet  definitive,  but  vitamin  D  insufficiency  may  increase  asthma  risk 
in  the  progeny  and  supplementation  may  decrease  such  risk.  Simi-
larly, preliminary studies suggest that maternal supplementation with  
vitamins C and E and zinc may decrease asthma in children. One study 
suggested  that  maternal  polyunsaturated  fatty  acid  supplementation 
may decrease childhood asthma risk. Observational studies have sug-
gested  that  increased  maternal  sugar  intake  may  increase  childhood 
asthma risk.

Obesity  Multiple studies suggest that obesity may be a risk factor 
for development of childhood and adult asthma. Adipokines and IL-6 
have been thought to play a pathobiologic role. Some have argued that 
the risk is overestimated, and a study from NHANES II found an asso-
ciation with dyspnea but not with airway obstruction.

Medications  There  are  conflicting  data  regarding  prenatal  and 
early childhood risk for asthma posed by certain classes of medications. 
Use of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors in pregnancy has been 
associated with an increased risk of asthma in children (relative risk, 
1.36–1.45); however, another study found a small risk for H2 blockers 
only. Conflicting data have been presented on the risk of perinatal acet-
aminophen and early childhood acetaminophen use. In a prospective 
study, the use of acetaminophen was not associated with an increased 
risk of exacerbations in young children with asthma, when compared 
to ibuprofen.

Prenatal  and  Perinatal  Risk  Factors  Preeclampsia  and  pre-
maturity  have  been  associated  with  increased  risk  of  asthma  in  the 
progeny. Babies born by cesarean section are at higher risk for asthma. 
Those with neonatal jaundice are also at increased risk. Breast-feeding 
reduced early wheezing but has a less clear effect on later incidence of 
asthma.

Endogenous  Developmental  Risk  Factors  Asthma  is  more 
prevalent among boys than girls, with the difference receding by age 20 
and reversing (more prevalent among women) by age 40. Atopy is more 
prevalent among boys in childhood, and they have reduced airway size 
compared with girls. Both factors are thought to contribute to the sex 
discrepancy. A subset of women develop asthma around menopause. 
Such asthma tends to involve non–type 2 mechanisms. Pregnancy may 
precipitate or aggravate asthma as well.

High-Concentration  Irritant  Exposure  and  RADS  A  soli-
tary  exposure  to  a  high  concentration  of  irritant  agents  that  rapidly 
(usually within hours) produces bronchospasm and bronchial hyper-
activity  is  known  as  RADS.  Causative  agents  include  oxidizing  and 
reducing agents in an aerosol or high levels of particulates. The acute 
pathology  usually  involves  epithelial  injury  with  neutrophilia.  There 
is little evidence of type 2 inflammation. This syndrome differs from 
occupational asthma in that these patients have not become sensitized 
to the provocative agent and can return to work in that environment 
once they have recovered. However, the course of the disease may be 
variable,  with  some  series  showing  documented  abnormalities  and 
persistent symptoms 10 years after exposure.

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory SystemFungi and Allergic Airway Mycoses  One to 2% of patients with 
asthma may have an IgE-mediated sensitization to colonization of the 
airway by fungi, with the most common fungus causing such a reac-
tion being Aspergillus fumigatus. So-called allergic bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis (ABPA) is characterized by a type 2 airway inflammatory 
response to aspergillus with IgE >1000 IU/mL, eosinophils >500/μL, 
positive skin test to Aspergillus, and specific IgE and IgG antibodies to 
Aspergillus. Patients may have intermittent mucus plugging and cen-
tral bronchiectasis. Up to two-thirds of patients will grow Aspergillus 
from  the  sputum.  Treatment  involves  systemic  antifungal  treatment 
with itraconazole or voriconazole and oral corticosteroids.

Exercise-Induced  Symptoms  in  Elite  Athletes  Exercise- 
induced airway narrowing in elite athletes undertaking extreme exercise 
in  strenuous  condition.  These  athletes  may  have  little,  or  no,  airway 
hyperreactivity or asthma risk factors. The condition may involve addi-
tional mechanisms including direct  epithelial injury. Such a syndrome 
has also been reported in swimmers possibly related to pool chlorination.

 ■ TRIGGERS OF AIRWAY NARROWING
The risk factors and exposures reviewed above lead to increased air-
way reactivity and a propensity to react to factors that trigger airway 
narrowing (see Fig. 287-1). Almost all asthmatics can identify triggers 
that will make their asthma worse. These triggers are listed in Table 
287-2. Many of them overlap with the risk factors and etiologic fac-
tors reviewed above. In some cases, elimination of these triggers may 
dramatically reduce the impairment caused by asthma. In a minority, 
abatement  can  lead  to  “remission”  so  that  these  patients  no  longer 
require  asthma  medications  and  do  not  experience  bronchospasm 
with their daily activities and routines. While acute exposures to these 
triggers generally cause short-lived bronchospasm, the bronchospasm 
may be severe enough that treatment for an exacerbation is required. 
Chronic  exposure  may  lead  to  permanent  deterioration  in  asthma 
control, although this does not appear to be true for exercise or stress. 
It  should  be  noted  that  evidence  suggests  that  severe  asthma  exac-
erbations  (those  requiring  systemic  corticosteroids)  may,  in  and  of 
themselves, accelerate lung function decline.

Allergens 
In  patients  with  sensitization  to  particular  allergens 
through production of allergen-specific IgE, exposure to those aller-
gens by inhalation can result in activation of mast cells and basophils 
with acute production of bronchoactive mediators (see Fig. 287-3). Such 
exposure  can  produce  immediate  bronchospasm  (early  response) 
and a late response (2–24 h after exposure) with bronchial narrowing 
and  inflammation.  These  mechanisms  can  account  for  reactions  to 
inhalation of pollens, mold, or dust; insects (especially cockroaches); 
animals;  occupational  materials;  seasonal  worsening  of  asthma;  and 
so-called “thunderstorm asthma.” Chronic exposure may lead to per-
sistent  symptoms.  While  food  allergies  can  produce  bronchospasm 
through  anaphylaxis,  food  allergies  are  generally  not  etiologically 
linked to asthma.

Irritants  Many asthmatics report increased symptoms on exposure 
to strong odors, smoke, combustion products, cleaning fluids, or per-
fumes. In general, the effects are short-lived, although chronic exposure  
(see  “Occupational  Exposures”  above)  and  large-quantity  exposures 
(see discussion of RADS above) can lead to long-lasting or permanent 
symptoms.

Viral  Infections  Most  asthmatics  report  that  asthma  exacerba-
tions can be triggered by upper respiratory infections. The inflamma-
tion that occurs may be neutrophilic as well as eosinophilic. There is 
some  evidence  that  IgE  generation  may  reduce  production  of  inter-
feron, possibly predisposing to the effects of upper respiratory viruses. 
Increased  airway  reactivity  after  viral  infections  generally  persists 
for 4–6 weeks but, in some cases, may be associated with permanent 
changes and impairment.

Exercise  and  Cold/Dry  Air  Exercise  may  be  a  trigger  to  asth-
matic bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma. Hyperventilation 

that occurs with exercise dries the airway lining, changing the tonicity 
of  lining  cells  and  causing  release  of  bronchoconstrictive  mediators. 
This effect is more prominent the lower the moisture content of the 
air, and since cold air has a lower absolute moisture content, the lower 
the  temperature  of  the  inspired  air,  the  less  exercise  is  required  to 
induce bronchoconstriction. In addition, cold air may produce airway 
edema  during  airway  wall  rewarming.  At  routine  levels  of  exercise, 
these effects are short-lived.

2153

Air  Pollution 
Increased  rates  of  exacerbations  have  been  asso-
ciated  with  increased  ambient  ozone,  sulfur  dioxide,  and  nitrogen 
dioxide, among other air pollutants.

Drugs  Beta  blockers  may  trigger  bronchospasm  even  when  used 
solely  in  ophthalmic  preparations.  While  the  more  selective  beta 
blockers  are  safe  for  most  asthmatics,  beta  blocker  use  may  be  a 
cause  of  difficult-to-control  asthma.  Aspirin  may  precipitate  bron-
chospasm in those with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (see 
“Special  Considerations”).  Angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE) 
inhibitors (and to a lesser extent angiotensin receptor blockers) may 
cause cough.

Occupational Exposures 
In addition to RADS (see above), epi-
sodic  and/or  recurrent  exposures  to  workplace  irritants  and/or  sub-
stances to which one has become sensitized can produce symptoms. 
These  symptoms  are  usually  reduced  when  patients  are  away  from 
such exposures on weekends or vacation.

Stress  Asthmatics may report increased symptoms with stress. The 
mechanisms are poorly understood.

Hormonal Factors  A small proportion of women report a regu-
lar increase in perimenstrual symptoms, and symptoms may worsen 
during  perimenopause.  This  may  be  related  to  rapid  fluctuations  in 
estrogen  levels.  Pregnancy  can  precipitate  worsening  of  asthma  in 
approximately one-third of pregnant patients.

 ■ COMORBIDITIES
Comorbidities  may  make  asthma  difficult  to  manage,  and  the  com-
mon comorbidities are listed in Table 287-3.

Obesity  Obese adults with asthma have more severe asthma symp-
toms than lean adults and are two to four times more likely to be hos-
pitalized with an asthma exacerbation. Nonrandomized studies have 
shown  an  improvement  and  significant  reduction  in  exacerbations 
after bariatric surgery.

2154 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease  The presence of gastroesoph-
ageal  reflux  disease  (GERD)  predicts  poor  quality  of  life  and  is  an 
independent predictor of asthma exacerbations. Treatment of symp-
tomatic  reflux  disease  has  been  shown  to  produce  modest  improve-
ments  in  airway  function,  symptoms,  and  exacerbation  frequency. 
Treatment of asymptomatic patients has not shown a benefit.
Rhinosinusitis  And/Or  Nasal  Polyposis  Rhinosinusitis  may 
be a manifestation of the eosinophilic inflammation in the lower air-
way in asthma. In addition, poorly controlled rhinosinusitis is believed 
to aggravate asthma by several potential mechanisms including inflam-
matory and irritant effects of the secretions on the lower airway, neural 
reflexes,  and  production  of  inflammatory  mediators  and  cells  that 
produce  systemic  inflammation.  Treatment  with  intranasal  corticos-
teroids has been shown to decrease airway reactivity and emergency 
department  visits  and  hospitalizations.  Evidence  for  the  benefit  of 
surgical therapy is inconclusive. There is increasing evidence that bio-
logics targeted at type 2 inflammation may also be particularly useful 
for asthma associated with rhinosinusitis and polyposis in particular.

Nasal polyposis is rare in children, and its presence in adults with 
asthma should raise suspicions of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory dis-
ease (see “Special Considerations”).
Vocal  Cord  Dysfunction  Now  known  as  inducible  laryngeal 
obstruction, vocal cord dysfunction involves inappropriate narrowing 
of the larynx, producing resistance to airflow. It can complicate asthma 
and mimic it. It is more commonly seen in women and patients with 
anxiety  and  depression.  Definitive  diagnosis  involves  laryngoscopy 
during symptomatic episodes or during induced obstruction.

Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease  (COPD)  See 
“Asthma-COPD Overlap” under “Special Considerations.”
Anxiety/Depression 
Increased  rates  of  asthma  exacerbations 
occur in asthmatics with anxiety, depression, or chronic stress. Some 
patients may be unable to distinguish anxiety attacks from asthma.

DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION
 ■ APPROACH
A presumptive diagnosis of asthma can usually be made based on a 
compatible history of recurrent wheezing, shortness of breath, chest 
tightness,  or  cough  related  to  common  bronchoconstrictor  precipi-
tants when appropriate components of the differential diagnosis have 
been considered and/or eliminated. In some cases, a therapeutic trial 
of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) may be considered. In all but 
the mildest cases, the diagnosis should be confirmed with pulmonary 
function  testing  or  demonstration  of  airway  hyperresponsiveness. 
Unfortunately, the diagnosis may be difficult to confirm after initia-
tion of therapy since airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness may 
be mitigated with therapy. A trial of tapering medications may be nec-
essary. Studies have shown that more than one-third of patients with a 
physician diagnosis of asthma do not meet the criteria for the diagnosis.
Adjunctive evaluation, as outlined below, should be undertaken to 
identify  precipitating  factors  and  underlying  mechanisms  that  may 
be  amenable  to  specific  therapies  (e.g.,  allergen  avoidance).  Cases 
that  require  more  than  a  daily  moderate-dose  ICS  combined  with 
a  long-acting  β2-agonist  (LABA)  (together  known  as  ICS/LABA) 
should undergo more formal evaluation to assess comorbidities that 
may  make  asthma  difficult  to  control  and  a  reassessment  of  any  
possible  confounding  diagnoses  that  may  mimic  asthma  symptoms 
(see Table 287-3).
 ■ PRIMARY ASSESSMENT TOOLS FOR 
ESTABLISHING A DIAGNOSIS
History  Patients  with  asthma  most  commonly  complain  of  epi-
sodes  of  wheezing,  shortness  of  breath,  chest  tightness,  mucus  pro-
duction,  or  cough  upon  exposure  to  triggers  listed  in  Table  287-2. 
Symptoms  may  be  worse  on  arising  in  the  morning.  Some  may 
have  nocturnal  symptoms  alone.  However,  such  patients  should  be 
evaluated for postnasal drip or GERD if that is their sole presenting 

symptom.  Patients  frequently  complain  of  symptoms  with  rapid 
changes of temperature or humidity. Exercise-induced symptoms are 
common with increased sensitivity to cold air. As compared to cardiac 
sources of dyspnea, exercise symptoms tend to develop more slowly 
after initiation of exercise and tend to resolve more slowly unless a β2-ag-
onist is administered after the onset of symptoms. A careful exposure 
history  should  be  obtained  for  home  (e.g.,  pets,  molds,  dust,  direct 
or  secondhand  smoke),  work  (work  environment  and  exposure  to 
occupational sensitizers), and recreational (e.g., hobbies, recreational 
inhalants)  exposures.  Allergen-sensitized  patients  may  complain  of 
symptoms on exposure to known allergens such as animals and may 
complain of increased symptoms during specific pollen seasons. Up to 
two-thirds of patients with asthma will be atopic (as opposed to half 
of the U.S. population), and almost half will have a history of rhinitis, 
with  many  complaining  of  intermittent  sinusitis.  In  patients  with 
adult-onset asthma, a careful occupational history should be obtained 
and  a  history  of  reactions  to  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs) or use of new medications, such as beta blockers (includ-
ing  ophthalmic  preparations)  and  ACE  inhibitors  (due  to  potential 
cough), should be elicited.

Physical Examination 
In between acute attacks, physical find-
ings  may  be  normal.  Many  patients  will  have  evidence  of  allergic 
rhinitis  with  pale  nasal  mucus  membranes.  Five  percent  or  more 
of  patients  may  have  nasal  polyps,  with  increased  frequency  in 
those with more severe asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory 
disease. Some patients will have wheezing on expiration (less so on 
inspiration).  During  an  acute  asthma  attack,  patients  present  with 
tachypnea  and  tachycardia,  and  use  of  accessory  muscles  can  be 
observed. Wheezing, with a prolonged expiratory phase, is common 
during attacks, but as the severity of airway obstruction progresses, 
the chest may become “silent” with loss of breath sounds.

Pulmonary  Function  Tests  Effective  reduction  of  the  airway 
lumen in asthma produces increased resistance to airflow, which can be 
detected as a reduction in expiratory airflow during forced expiratory 
maneuvers.  The  peak  expiratory  flow  rate  (PEFR),  forced  expiratory 
volume in 1 s (FEV1), and the FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio 
are  reduced  below  the  lower  limit  of  normal.  The  flow-volume  loop 
may show a characteristic scalloping (see Chap. 286). These findings 
may  not  be  present  during  acute  attacks  or  on  therapy  (especially 
after recent use of bronchodilators). Reversibility is defined as a ≥12% 
increase  in  the  FEV1  and  an  absolute  increase  of  ≥200  mL  at  least  
15  min  after  administration  of  a  β2-agonist  or  after  several  weeks  of 
corticosteroid therapy. Diurnal peak flow variability of >20% has also 
been proposed as an indicator of reversible airways disease, but it is less 
reliable due to difficulties with quality control and variability of home 
assessments. Lung volumes and diffusing capacity should be normal in 
uncomplicated asthma.

Assessment of Airway Responsiveness 
In cases where pulmo-
nary function tests are nonconfirmatory and the diagnosis remains in 
doubt, testing to demonstrate increased reactivity to provocative stim-
uli in the laboratory can be undertaken. Methacholine, a cholinergic 
agonist, inhaled in increasing concentrations is most commonly used. 
A provocative dose producing a 20% drop in FEV1 (PD20) is calculated, 
with a value ≤400 μg indicative of airway reactivity. Mannitol is used 
as  well,  and  occasionally,  hypertonic  saline  may  be  used.  Challenge 
with exercise and/or cold, dry air can be performed, with a positive 
response recorded if there is a ≥10% drop in FEV1 from baseline. In 
the case of suspected environmental/occupational exposures, specific 
allergen challenges may be undertaken in highly specialized labs.

 ■ ADJUNCTIVE ASSESSMENT TOOLS
Eosinophil  Counts  A  large  proportion  of  asthma  patients  not 
treated  with  oral  or  high-dose  ICSs  will  have  eosinophil  counts 
≥300  cells/μL.  Eosinophil  counts  correlate  with  severity  of  disease 
in  population  studies.  Their  presence  in  patients  with  severe  asthma 
indicates  a  likelihood  that  the  patient  would  respond  to  medications

targeted  at  type  2  inflammation.  Extremely  elevated  levels  should 
prompt consideration of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
or primary eosinophilic disorders.

IgE, Skin Tests, and Radioallergosorbent Tests  Total serum 
IgE  levels  are  useful  in  considering  whether  patients  with  severe 
asthma  would  be  eligible  for  anti-IgE  therapy.  Levels  >1000  IU/mL 
should  prompt  consideration  of  ABPA.  Skin  tests,  or  their  in  vitro 
counterparts  that  detect  IgE  directed  at  specific  antigens  (radioal-
lergosorbent  test  [RAST]),  can  be  useful  in  confirming  atopy  and 
suggesting  allergic  rhinitis,  which  can  complicate  asthma  manage-
ment.  Allergy  investigations  may  be  useful,  when  correlated  with  a 
history of reactions, in identifying environmental exposures that may 
be aggravating asthma.

Exhaled  Nitric  Oxide  Fraction  of  exhaled  nitric  oxide  (FeNO) 
in exhaled breath is an approximate indicator of eosinophilic inflam-
mation in the airways. It is easily suppressed by ICSs and, thus, can be 
used to assess adherence in patients in whom it was initially elevated. 
Elevated  levels  (>35–40  ppb)  in  untreated  patients  are  indicative  of 
eosinophilic inflammation. Levels >20–25 ppb in patients with severe 
asthma on moderate- to high-dose ICS indicate either poor adherence 
or persistent type 2 inflammation despite therapy.

 ■ ADDITIONAL EVALUATION IN SEVERE/POORLY 
RESPONSIVE ASTHMA
In patients with poorly responsive asthma, additional evaluations for 
comorbidities  (see  Table  287-3)  may  be  necessary,  including  sinus 
radiographic  studies  (even  in  those  who  have  no  symptoms  of  sinus 
disease) and esophageal studies in those who have symptoms of reflux. 
In patients with nonreversible disease, many obtain a serum α1 antit-
rypsin level. Additionally, the following evaluations may be of utility in 
poorly responsive asthma.

Chest Radiography  Chest CT can be useful to assess for the pres-
ence  of  bronchiectasis  and  other  structural  abnormalities  that  could 
produce airway obstruction. New image analysis tools are being used 
in the research setting to assess airway properties such as airway wall 
thickness, airway diameter, and evidence of air trapping.

Sputum 
Induced sputum may be used in more specialized centers 
to help characterize type 2 and non–type 2 inflammation by detection 
of eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. In severe asthma, there is 
some evidence that some patients may have localized persistent eosin-
ophilic airway inflammation despite lack of peripheral eosinophils on 
blood analysis.

TREATMENT
Asthma

GOALS OF ASTHMA THERAPY AND ASSESSMENT  
OF CONTROL
Goals of asthma therapy in terms of achieving control of symptoms 
and  reducing  risk  (as  reflected  in  frequency  of  asthma  exacerba-
tions)  are  listed  in  Table  287-4.  The  therapeutic  agents  used  in 
treatment are discussed below, and an integrated approach to care 
is discussed subsequently.

A  comprehensive  treatment  approach  involves  avoiding  and 
reducing  asthma  triggers  and,  if  necessary,  the  adjunctive  use  of 
medications. Asthma medications are primarily divided into those 
that relax smooth muscle and produce a fairly rapid relief of acute 
symptoms and those that target inflammation or mediator produc-
tion. The former medications are commonly referred to as reliever 
medications, and the latter are known as controller medications. 

REDUCING TRIGGERS
Mitigation  As  shown  in  Tables  287-1  and  287-2,  triggers  and 
exposures  can  cause  asthma  and  make  it  difficult  to  control.  In 

TABLE 287-4  Goals of Asthma Therapy
1.  Reduction in symptom frequency to ≤2 times/week
2.  Reduction of nighttime awakenings to ≤2 times/month
3.  Reduction of reliever use to ≤2 times a week (except before exercise)
4.  No more than 1 exacerbation/year
5.  Optimization of lung function
6.  Maintenance of normal daily activities
7.  Satisfaction with asthma care with minimal or no side effects of treatment

the  case  of  those  with  occupational  exposures,  removal  from  the 
offending environment may sometimes result in complete resolu-
tion of symptoms or significant improvement. Secondhand smoke 
exposure and frequent exposure to combustion products of cann-
abis are remediable environmental exposures as well. The removal 
of pets that are clearly associated with symptoms can reduce symp-
toms. Pest control at home and in the school in those with evidence 
of  IgE-mediated  sensitivity  (skin  test  or  IgE  RAST)  may  also  be 
beneficial.  The  effect  of  dust  or  mold  control  in  reducing  asthma 
symptoms has been more variable. There is moderate evidence that 
dust control (impermeable mattress and pillowcase covers) in those 
patients with symptoms and sensitization may be effective in reduc-
ing  symptoms  only  when  conducted  as  part  of  a  comprehensive 
allergen mitigation strategy. 
Allergen  Immunotherapy  Allergen  immunotherapy  reduces  IgE-
mediated reactions to the allergens administered. It clearly reduces 
the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and thus may be helpful in reduc-
ing this comorbidity. The evidence for its effectiveness in isolated 
asthma in those who are sensitized and have clinical symptoms is 
variable.  Due  to  the  risk  of  anaphylaxis,  guidelines  generally  rec-
ommend immunotherapy only in patients whose asthma is under 
control and who have mild to moderate asthma. The evidence base 
for the effectiveness of sublingual allergen immunotherapy in the 
treatment of asthma is not substantial. 
Vaccination  Respiratory  infections  are  a  major  cause  of  asthma 
exacerbations. Patients with asthma are strongly advised to receive 
both types of currently available pneumococcal vaccines and yearly 
influenza vaccines. COVID-19 vaccination is advised, as well. 

MEDICATIONS 
Bronchodilators  Bronchodilators  relax  airway  smooth  muscle. 
There  are  three  major  classes  of  bronchodilators,  β2-agonists,   
anticholinergics, and theophylline.
a2-Agonists  Available in inhaled or oral form, these agents acti-
vate β2-receptors present on airway smooth muscle. Such receptors 
are also present on mast cells, but they contribute little to the effi-
cacy of these agents in asthma. β2-receptors are G protein–coupled 
receptors that activate adenyl cyclase to produce cyclic AMP, which 
results in relaxation of smooth muscle. 
Use  β2-Agonists are primarily used in inhaled forms to provide 
relief  of  bronchospasm  or  to  reduce  the  degree  of  bronchospasm 
anticipated  in  response  to  exercise  or  other  provocative  stimuli. 
Regular  use  has  been  associated  with  tachyphylaxis  of  the  bron-
choprotective  effect  and  possible  increased  airway  reactivity.  This 
may be more common in patients with a polymorphism at the 16th 
amino  acid  position  of  the  β2-receptor.  Frequent  short-acting  β-2 
agonist  use  has  been  associated  with  increased  asthma  mortality 
resulting  in  decreased  enthusiasm  for  use  in  isolation  without 
inhaled corticosteroids. 
Short-Acting  a2-Agonists  Albuterol  (also  known  as  salbuta-
mol) is the most commonly used agent. Bronchodilation begins 
within  3–5  min  of  inhalation,  and  effects  generally  last  4–6  h. 
It  is  most  commonly  administered  by  metered-dose  inhaler. 
Solutions  for  nebulization  are  also  used,  especially  for  relief  of 
bronchospasm in children. Oral forms are available but are not 
commonly used.

Long-Acting a2-Agonists  Salmeterol and formoterol are the two 
available  LABAs.  They    have  an  ~12-h  duration  of  action.  Formo-
terol has a quick onset comparable to the short-acting β2-agonists.  
Salmeterol has a slower onset of action. These agents can be used 
for  prophylaxis  of  exercise-induced  bronchospasm.  In  contrast  to 
their use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), these 
agents are not recommended for use as monotherapy in the treat-
ment of asthma. Their use in asthma is generally restricted to use in 
combination with an ICS. 

Ultra-Long-Acting a2-Agonists  These agents (indacaterol, olo-
daterol,  and  vilanterol)  have  a  24-h  effect.  They  are  only  used  in 
combination with ICSs in the treatment of asthma. 
Safety  β2-Agonists  are  fairly  specific  for  the  β2-receptors,  but 
in  some  patients  and  especially  at  higher  doses,  they  can  pro-
duce  tremor,  tachycardia,  palpitations,  and  hypertension.  They 
promote potassium reentry into cells, and at high doses, they can 
produce  hypokalemia.  Type  B  (nonhypoxic)  lactic  acidosis  can 
also occur and is thought to be secondary to increased glycoge-
nolysis  and  glycolysis  and  increased  lipolysis,  leading  to  a  rise 
in  fatty  acid  levels,  which  can  inhibit  conversion  of  pyruvate  to 
acetyl-coenzyme A.

Increased  asthma  mortality  was  associated  with  high- 
potency  β2-agonists  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  Increased  use 
of β2-agonists for relief of bronchospasm is a clear marker of poor 
asthma  control  and  has  been  associated  with  increased  mortality. 
Questions  had  been  raised  as  to  whether  adding  LABAs  to  ICS 
might  be  associated  with  severe  adverse  asthma  outcomes,  but 
several studies have not detected such outcomes in comparison to 
maintaining the ICS dose. 
Anticholinergics  Cholinergic  nerve–induced  smooth-muscle 
constriction plays a role in asthmatic bronchospasm. Anticholiner-
gic medications can produce smooth-muscle relaxation by antago-
nizing this mechanism of airway narrowing. Agents that have been 
developed for asthma have been pharmacologically designed to be 
less systemically absorbed so as to minimize their systemic anticho-
linergic  effects.  The  long-acting  agents  in  this  class  are  known  as 
long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). 
Use  The short-acting agents in this class can be used alone for 
acute  bronchodilation.  They  appear  to  be  somewhat  less  effective 
than β2-agonists and have a slower onset of action as well. 
Safety  Dry mouth may occur. At higher doses and in the elderly, 
acute  glaucoma  and  urinary  retention  have  been  reported.  There 
was  a  numerical  (but  not  significant)  difference  in  mortality  in 
African Americans treated with ICS/LAMA versus ICS/LABA for 
asthma. 
Theophylline  Theophylline,  an  oral  compound  that  increases 
cyclic  AMP  levels  by  inhibiting  phosphodiesterase,  is  now  rarely 
used for asthma due to its narrow therapeutic window, drug-drug 
interactions,  and  reduced  bronchodilation  as  compared  to  other 
agents. 

Controller (Anti-Inflammatory/Antimediator) Therapies  So-called 
“controller”  therapies  reduce  asthma  exacerbations  and  improve 
long-term  control,  decreasing  the  need  for  intermittent  use  of 
bronchodilator  therapies.  None  of  these  therapies  have  yet  been 
shown  to  prevent  progression  of  airway  remodeling  or  the  more 
rapid decline in lung function that can occur in a subset of asthma 
patients. 
Corticosteroids  Corticosteroids  are  particularly  effective  in 
reducing  type  2  inflammation  and  airway  hyperresponsiveness. 
Corticosteroids  bind  to  a  cytoplasmic  glucocorticoid  receptor  to 
form a complex that translocates to the nucleus. The complex binds 
to positive and negative response elements that result in inhibition 
of T-cell activation; eosinophil function, migration, and prolifera-
tion;  and  proinflammatory  cytokine  elaboration  and  activation  of 

nuclear  factor-κB.  It  also  attaches  to  other  transcription  factors, 
resulting in deactivation of other proinflammatory pathways. 
Use  Corticosteroids reduce airway hyperresponsiveness, improve 
airway function, prevent asthma exacerbations, and improve asthma 
symptoms. Corticosteroid use by inhalation (ICSs) minimizes sys-
temic toxicity and represents a cornerstone of asthma treatment.

ICS and ICS/LABA 
ICSs are the cornerstone of asthma therapy. 
They  take  advantage  of  the  pleiotropic  effects  of  corticosteroids 
to  produce  salutary  impact  at  levels  of  systemic  effect  consider-
ably  lower  than  oral  corticosteroids.  Their  use  is  associated  with 
decreased asthma mortality. They are generally used regularly twice 
a day as first-line therapy for all forms of persistent asthma. Doses 
are increased, and they are combined with LABAs to control asthma 
of increasing severity. European guidelines now recommend their 
intermittent use even in intermittent asthma. Combining them with 
LABAs permits effective control at lower ICS dose. Longer-acting 
preparations permitting once-a-day use are available. Their effects 
can be noticeable in several days, but continued improvement may 
occur  over  months  of  therapy,  with  the  majority  of  improvement 
evident  within  the  first  month  of  regular  use.  Adherence  to  reg-
ular therapy is generally poor, with as few as 25% of total annual 
prescriptions being refilled. Very high doses are sometimes used to 
reduce oral corticosteroid requirements. Not all patients respond to 
ICS. Increasing evidence suggests that the most responsive patients 
are those with significant type 2–mediated asthma. 

Oral Corticosteroids  Chronic oral corticosteroids (OCSs) at the 
lowest doses possible (due to side effects) are used in patients who 
cannot  achieve  acceptable  asthma  control  without  them.  Alter-
nate-day  dosing  may  be  preferred,  and  pneumocystis  pneumonia 
prophylaxis should be administered for those maintained on a daily 
prednisone  dose  of  ≥20  mg.  OCSs  are  also  used  to  treat  asthma 
exacerbations, frequently at a dose of 40–60 mg/d of prednisone or 
equivalent  for  1–2  weeks.  Since  they  are  well  absorbed,  they  may 
also be used for managing hospitalized patients. 

Intravenous Corticosteroids 
Intravenous preparations are fre-
quently  used  in  hospitalized  patients.  Patients  are  rapidly  transi-
tioned to OCS once their condition has stabilized. 

Intramuscular  Corticosteroids 
In  high-risk,  poorly  adherent 
patients,  intramuscular  triamcinolone  acetonide  has  been  used  to 
achieve asthma control and reduce exacerbations. 

Safety  Chronic  administration  of  systemic  corticosteroids  is 
associated with a plethora of side effects including diabetes, oste-
oporosis,  cataracts  and  glaucoma,  bruising,  weight  gain,  truncal 
obesity,  hypertension,  ulcers,  depression,  and  accelerated  cardiac 
risk, among others. Appropriate monitoring and infectious (pneu-
mocystis pneumonia prophylaxis for those treated chronically with 
≥20 mg prednisone/d) and bone health prophylaxis are necessary. 
Intermittent  “bursts”  of  systemic  corticosteroids  to  treat  asthma 
exacerbations are associated with reduced side effects, but observa-
tional studies have suggested that the cumulative dose over time is 
associated with deleterious side effects.

ICSs  have  dramatically  reduced  side  effects  as  compared  to 
OCSs. At higher doses, bruising occurs and osteoporosis can accel-
erate.  There  is  a  small  increase  in  glaucoma  and  cataracts.  Local 
effects include thrush, which can be reduced by use of a spacer and 
gargling. Hoarseness may be the result of a direct myopathic effect 
on the vocal cords. Rare patients exhibit side effects even at mod-
erate doses of ICS. Children may experience growth suppression. 
Leukotriene  Modifiers  Agents  that  inhibit  production  of  leu-
kotrienes (zileuton, an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase) or the action of 
leukotrienes  at  the  CysLT1  receptor  (montelukast  and  zafirlukast) 
are moderately effective in asthma. 

They can improve airway function and reduce exacerbations but 
not to the same degree as bronchodilators or ICS, respectively. They 
are also effective in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis and, thus, 

HPIM21e_Part7_p2131-p2216.indd   2156

20/01/22   6:20 PM

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemcan be used in patients with concomitant allergic rhinitis. Montelu-
kast, in particular, is frequently used in children with mild asthma 
due  to  concerns  of  ICS-related  growth  suppression.  Montelukast 
use may decrease due to safety warnings regarding depression with 
this  compound.  Leukotriene  modifiers  are  effective  in  preventing 
exercise-induced  bronchoconstriction  without  the  tachyphylactic 
effects that occur with regular use of LABAs. Leukotriene modifiers 
are particularly effective in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, 
which  is  characterized  by  significant  leukotriene  overproduction. 
They have also shown modest effect as add-on therapy in patients 
poorly controlled on high-dose ICS/LABA. 
CysLT1  Antagonists  Montelukast  and  zafirlukast  are  administered 
orally  once  or  twice  daily,  respectively.  The  onset  of  effect  is  rapid 
(hours),  with  the  majority  of  chronic  effectiveness  seen  within   
1 month. 

5-Lipoxygenase  Inhibition  Zileuton  in  its  extended  form  is 
administered orally twice a day. 
Safety  Montelukast  is  well  tolerated,  but  an  association  with 
suicidal ideation has now resulted in a warning label from the U.S. 
Food  and  Drug  Administration.  Zileuton  increases  liver  function 
tests (transaminases) in 3% of patients. Intermittent monitoring is 
suggested. It inhibits CYP1A2, and appropriate dose adjustments of 
concomitant medications may be necessary. 
Cromolyn  Sodium  Cromolyn  sodium  is  an  inhaled  agent 
believed to stabilize mast cells. It is only available by nebulization 
and must be administered two to four times a day. It is mildly to 
modestly  effective  and  appears  to  be  helpful  for  exercise-induced 
bronchospasm. It is used primarily in pediatrics in those concerned 
about ICS side effects. 
Anti-IgE  Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody to the Fc portion 
of the IgE molecule, prevents the binding of IgE to mast cells and 
basophils. Reduction in free IgE that can bind to effector cells blocks 
antigen-related  signaling,  which  is  responsible  for  production  or 
release of many of the mediators and cytokines critical to asthma 
pathobiology. In addition, through feedback mechanisms, reduction 
in IgE production occurs as well. Anti-IgE has been shown to increase 
interferon  production  in  rhinovirus  infections,  decrease  viral- 
induced asthma exacerbations, and reduce duration and peak viral 
shedding. This effect is believed to be due to IgE’s ability to reduce 
interferon γ production in response to viral infections. 
Use 
In  asthma,  anti-IgE  has  been  tested  in  patients  with  a 
circulating  IgE  ≥30  IU/mL  and  a  positive  skin  test  or  RAST  to  a 
perennial  allergen.  It  is  generally  used  in  patients  not  responsive 
to moderate- to high-dose ICS/LABA. It reduces exacerbations by 
25–50% and can reduce asthma symptoms but has minimal effect 
on lung function. Anti-IgE is dosed based on body weight and cir-
culating IgE and is administered subcutaneously every 2–4 weeks 
depending on the calculated dose. In the United States, the maximum 
dose is 300 mg every 2 weeks, which generally restricts the drug to 
those with a body weight ≤150 kg. Most effects are generally seen 
in 3–6 months. Retrospective studies have suggested that patients 
with an exhaled nitric oxide approximately ≥20 ppb or circulating 
eosinophils  ≥260/μL  have  the  greatest  response  as  ascertained  by 
reduction in exacerbations. FeNO is slightly reduced by treatment, 
but  circulating  IgE,  as  measured  by  available  clinical  tests,  is  not 
affected since these tests measure total circulating IgE, not free IgE. 
Safety  The incidence of side effects is low. Anaphylaxis has been 
reported in 0.2% of patients receiving the drug. 
IL-5–Active Drugs  Mepolizumab and reslizumab are monoclo-
nal antibodies that bind to IL-5, and benralizumab binds to the IL-5 
receptor. They rapidly (within a day) reduce circulating eosinophils. 
Use 
In  patients  symptomatic  on  moderate-  to  high-dose  ICS/
LABA, generally with two or more exacerbations that require OCS 
per year and with an eosinophil count of ≥300/μL, IL-5–active drugs 
reduce  exacerbations  by  about  half  or  more.  FEV1  and  symptoms

improve  moderately  as  well.  In  patients  who  are  not  on  chronic 
OCSs, these drugs are less effective in those with eosinophil counts 
<300/μL. They are also effective in reducing the need for chronic 
OCSs regardless of circulating eosinophil count (presumably due to 
the fact that many of those patients have type 2 inflammation but 
their circulating eosinophils have been suppressed by the systemic 
OCS). FeNO and IgE are relatively unaffected by these drugs. Most 
clinical effects are usually seen within 3–6 months. 
Safety  These drugs are associated with minimal side effects. Mepo-
lizumab and benralizumab are approved for home administration. 
Anti–IL-4/13  The IL-4 and IL-13 receptors are heterodimers that 
share a common subunit, IL-4 receptor α. Dupilumab binds to this 
subunit and, thus, blocks signaling through both receptors. 
Use 
In  addition  to  effectiveness  in  the  phenotype  of  patients 
who respond to anti–IL-5 therapies, poorly controlled patients on 
moderate-  to  high-dose  ICS/LABA  with  an  FeNO  of  20–25  ppb 
also appear to respond to dupilumab even if their peripheral eosin-
ophils are not elevated. Dupilumab reduces exacerbations by ≥50%, 
decreases symptoms, and may produce more of an effect on FEV1 
than anti–IL-5 drugs. It gradually reduces FeNO and IgE levels. Par-
adoxically,  circulating  eosinophil  counts  may  initially  temporarily 
increase. Most effects are seen by 3–6 months of therapy. 
Safety  Side effects are minimal but cases of serious systemic eos-
inophilia associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroids have 
been  noted.  This  drug  is  also  approved  for  home  administration 
and is also approved for atopic dermatitis. 
Bronchial  Thermoplasty,  Alternative  Therapies,  and  Therapies 
Under  Development  •  Bronchial  Thermoplasty  This  proce-
dure involves radiofrequency ablation of the airway smooth mus-
cle  in  the  major  airways  administered  through  a  series  of  three 
bronchoscopies  for  patients  with  severe  asthma.  There  is  some 
evidence  that  it  may  reduce  exacerbations  in  very  select  patients. 
The procedure may be accompanied by significant morbidity, and 
most guidelines do not recommend it other than in the context of 
clinical trials or registries. 
Alternative  Therapies  Alternative  therapies  such  as  acupunc-
ture and yoga have not been shown to improve asthma in controlled 
trials. Studies with placebo have demonstrated that there may be a 
significant response to placebo. 
Therapies  in  Development  Trials  are  underway  targeting 
pathways  and  receptors  shown  in  Fig.  287-3.  Those  in  more 
advanced  stages  of  development  include  therapies  targeting 
TSLP,  IL-33,  and  CRTH2.  Studies  targeting  IL-17  and  TNF-α 
have  not  shown  efficacy,  but  it  is  unclear  if  they  were  appropri-
ately  targeted.  Whether  these  interventions  might  prove  useful 
for  particular  endotypes  of  asthma  is  unclear.  Proof-of-concept 
studies targeting mast cells via inhibition of tyrosine kinase have 
suggested efficacy in severe asthma.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Asthma

U.S. (National Asthma Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP]) 
and  World  Health  Organization  (Global  Initiative  for  Asthma 
[GINA]) guidelines advise a symptomatic approach to asthma treat-
ment assuming that appropriate measures have been taken to address 
asthma  triggers,  exposures,  and  comorbidities  enumerated  in   
Tables  287-2  and  287-3.  Additionally,  adherence  and  inhaler  tech-
niques need to be addressed. Poor adherence or poor inhaler tech-
nique has been identified as the cause of poor asthma control in up 
to 50% of patients referred for poorly controlled asthma.

The stepwise approach to intensifying and reducing asthma ther-
apy  is  outlined  in  Table  287-5.  It  involves  “stepping”  therapy  up 
or  down  based  on  assessment  of  whether  asthma  is  controlled  by

the  criteria  listed  in  Table  287-4.  Assuming  comorbidities  have 
been addressed, adherence has been evaluated, education regarding 
avoiding triggers has been performed, and inhaler technique is ver-
ified,  the  cornerstone  of  preferred  therapy  is  the  intensification  of 
ICS therapy in conjunction with the use of a LABA to achieve greater 
control at lower ICS doses.

A  major  change  in  the  stepwise  approach,  advocated  for  more 
than  two  decades,  has  occurred.  Evidence  has  accumulated  that 
as-needed ICS can be used instead of regular ICS in milder asthma 
and that the trigger for such use could be patient perception of the 
need  to  use  a  reliever  inhaler.  Since  formoterol  is  a  LABA  with  a 
rapid onset, combination ICS/formoterol has been used as a single 
agent in multiple studies: as needed without background therapy in 
milder  asthma,  and  as  needed  in  addition  to  twice  daily  ICS/for-
moterol in more severe asthma. Since asthma mortality can occur 
even in mild asthma (albeit at lower rates than more severe asthma), 
GINA, as part of a comprehensive strategy of asthma management, 
recommends  ICS/formoterol  be  used  as  the  reliever  in  all  steps 
of  asthma  severity,  including  intermittent  asthma  (Step  1).  NAEPP 
guidelines  utilizing  evidence-based  studies  recommend  that  ICS/
formoterol be used as the reliever medication in patients requiring 
step 3 and 4 therapy (see Table 287-5) and that as-needed concom-
itant ICS and short-acting β-agonist (SABA) can be used as a ther-
apy in step 2. For the sake of simplicity, an adapted GINA approach 
is  outlined  in  Table  287-5  with  footnotes  identifying  the  major 
differences  from  the  NAEPP.  Leukotriene  receptor  antagonists 
(LTRAs) are alternative medications in step 2, which may be used 
in  those  concerned  about  the  minimal  ICS  side  effects.  However, 
recent  warnings  about  suicidal  ideation  associated  with  montelu-
kast may make this approach less appealing. Leukotriene modifiers 
and  long-acting  anticholinergics  are  possible  add-on  (adjunctive) 
therapies in those requiring step 4 and/or 5 therapies. Biologics are 
incredibly effective in their specific endotypes (type 2 with exacer-
bations and specific biomarkers, as previously described), but their 
high cost currently relegates them to step 5 therapy or beyond.

TREATMENT
Asthma Attacks

Asthma deteriorations of mild to moderate severity can be initially 
treated with a β2-agonist administered up to every 1 h. Increasing 
the  dose  of  ICSs  by  four-  to  fivefold  may  be  helpful  as  well.  If 
patients  fail  to  achieve  adequate  control  and  continue  to  require 
β2-agonists  hourly  for  several  hours,  they  should  be  referred  for 

urgent  care.  In  the  urgent  care  setting,  PEFR  or  FEV1  should  be 
assessed, and patients are usually treated with nebulized β2-agonists 
up to every 20 min. Those with PEFR >60% of predicted will fre-
quently respond to β2-agonists alone. If they fail to respond in 1–2 h, 
intravenous corticosteroids should be administered. Supplemental 
oxygen  is  usually  administered  to  correct  hypoxemia.  An  LTRA 
and magnesium are sometimes given as well. Nebulized anticholin-
ergics can be administered to produce additional bronchodilation. 
Failure to achieve PEFR >60% or persistent severe tachypnea over  
4–6  h  should  prompt  consideration  of  admission  to  the  hospital. 
In-hospital treatment may include continuous bronchodilator neb-
ulization.  Noninvasive  positive-pressure  ventilation  to  assist  with 
respiratory  exhaustion  is  sometimes  used  to  prevent  a  need  for 
intubation, and helium-oxygen mixtures may be used to decrease 
the work of breathing. Antibiotics should be administered only if 
there are signs of infection.

Mechanical  ventilation  may  be  difficult  in  patients  with  status 
asthmaticus  due  to  high  positive  pressures  in  the  setting  of  high 
resistance to airflow due to airway obstruction. Most patients with 
asthma attacks present with hypocapnia due to a high respiratory 
rate.  Normal  or  near-normal  Pco2  in  a  patient  with  asthma  in 
respiratory distress should raise concerns of impending respiratory 
failure and need for mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation 
should aim for low respiratory rates and/or ventilation volumes to 
decrease peak airway pressures. This can frequently be achieved by 
“permissive hypercapnia”—allowing the Pco2 to rise and, if neces-
sary,  temporarily  correcting  critical  acidosis  with  administration 
of fluids to increase the pH. Neuromuscular paralysis may some-
times  be  beneficial.  Bronchoscopy  to  clear  mucus  plugs  has  been 
described but may be dangerous in the setting of difficulties with 
mechanical ventilation.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
 ■ HIGH-RISK ASTHMA PATIENTS
Three to four thousand people die from asthma in the United States 
each year. Table 287-6 lists characteristics of patients at high risk for 
asthma death. These characteristics should be considered in evaluating 
and treating patients who present with asthma.
 ■ EXERCISE-INDUCED SYMPTOMS
In  many  cases,  the  degree  of  exercise  intolerance  may  reflect  poor 
asthma control. Treatment involves step therapy of asthma as outlined 
in Table 287-5. In other cases, however, asthma may be well controlled 
in all other respects, but patients may report that they cannot under-
take the level of exercise they desire. Some increase in exercise capacity

can be achieved by starting at lower levels of exercise (warming up) and 
by using a mask in colder weather to condition the air. Pretreatment 
with  an  SABA  can  increase  the  threshold  of  ventilation  required  to 
induce bronchoconstriction. LABAs may extend the period of protec-
tion, but their use alone in asthma is to be discouraged. For occasional 
exercise,  ICS/LABA  can  be  used,  but  regular  use  may  expose  the 
patient to unnecessary doses of ICS. If regular exercise is undertaken, 
then LTRAs may provide protection and can be used regularly. A SABA 
(or ICS/formoterol) should always be available for quick relief.

Exercise-induced airway narrowing in elite athletes may be related 
to  direct  epithelial  injury.  In  addition  to  the  above,  conditioning 
of  incoming  air  may  be  of  major  assistance.  Ipratropium  has  been 
reported to be of utility as well.

 ■ PREGNANCY
Asthma may improve, deteriorate, or remain unchanged during preg-
nancy. Poor asthma control, especially exacerbations, is associated with 
poor  fetal  outcomes.  The  general  principles  of  asthma  management 
and its goals are unchanged. Avoidance of triggers, especially smoking 
environments, is critical in view of the risk of loss of control and, in 
the case of smoking, its clear effects on risk of development of asthma 
in  the  child.  There  is  extensive  experience  suggesting  the  safety  of 
inhaled albuterol, beclomethasone, budesonide, and fluticasone, with 
reassuring  information  on  formoterol  and  salmeterol  in  pregnancy. 
Animal studies have not suggested toxicity for montelukast, zafirlukast, 
omalizumab, and ipratropium. Antibodies cross the placenta, and there 
are few human data on the safety of IL-5–active drugs or anti–IL-4Rα. 
Chronic use of OCS has been associated with neonatal adrenal insuffi-
ciency, preeclampsia, low birth weight, and a slight increase in the fre-
quency of cleft palate. However, it is clear that poorly controlled asthma 
during  pregnancy  carries  greater  risk  to  the  fetus  and  mother  than 
these  effects.  There  should  be  no  hesitancy  in  administering  routine 
pharmacotherapy for acute exacerbations. Initiation of allergen immu-
notherapy or omalizumab during pregnancy is not recommended. In 
cases where prostaglandins are needed to manage pregnancy, PGF2-α 
should be avoided since it is associated with bronchoconstriction.

 ■ SEVERE ASTHMA
Severe  and  difficult-to-treat  asthma,  which  composes  ~5–10%  of 
asthma, is defined as asthma that, having undergone appropriate evalu-
ation for comorbidities and mimics, education, and trigger mitigation, 
remains uncontrolled on step 5 therapy or requires step 5 therapy for 
its  control.  Severe  asthma  can  account  for  almost  50%  of  the  cost  of 
asthma  care  in  the  United  States.  A  significant  proportion  of  these 
patients  have  trouble  with  adherence  and/or  inhaler  technique,  and 
these factors need to be investigated vigorously. Almost half of these 
patients  have  evidence  of  persistent  eosinophilic  inflammation  as 
evidenced  by  peripheral  blood  eosinophils  and/or  induced  sputum. 
Those  with  recurrent  exacerbations  have  a  substantially  increased 
likelihood  of  responding  to  the  type  2  targeted  biologics.  Treatment 
for  those  with  mixed  inflammation,  isolated  neutrophilic  inflamma-
tion,  or  pauci-granulocytic  inflammation  remains  to  be  determined. 
Some  data  suggest  that  many  of  these  patients  may  have  aberrations 
in  the  pathways  responsible  for  resolution  of  inflammation.  A  rare 
patient may have biochemical abnormalities that interfere with steroid 
response pathways. Macrolides are of use in a subset. Studies targeting 
mast cells, IL-6, IL-33, and other pathways illustrated in Fig. 287-3 are 
underway. Therapies aimed at improving pro-resolving pathways may 
also be promising.

 ■ ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA
Asthma  may  present  at  or  persist  into  older  age.  The  mortality  of 
asthma in those >65 years old is five times greater than that of younger 
cohorts even when adjusting for comorbidities. Many of these patients 
had asthma as children, some with quiescent periods as they entered 
adulthood. Of those with new-onset asthma, almost half were smok-
ers  or  are  currently  smoking.  One-quarter  of  adult-onset  asthma  is 
believed to be due to occupational exposure. Patients presenting with 
eosinophilic inflammation appear to have more severe asthma. Besides 
investigations of comorbidities, these patients may require adjustment 
to  step  therapy  based  on  intolerance  of  β2-agonist  therapy  due  to 
arrhythmia  or  tremulousness.  The  coexistence  of  COPD  needs  to  be 
carefully considered (see below).

 ■ ASTHMA-COPD OVERLAP
Most  clinicians  agree  that  asthma-COPD  overlap  is  not  a  syndrome, 
but  rather  recognize  that  it  may  be  useful  to  identify  patients  who 
present  with  symptoms  related  to  airway  dysfunction  that  may  be 
due to simultaneous coexistence of both asthma and COPD. From an 
asthma perspective, recognition that COPD and smoking can alter the 
response to asthma therapies may be important. Smoking can blunt the 
response to ICS. Further, it has been difficult to demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of biologic agents targeted at type 2 inflammation in patients 
with  COPD  despite  the  presence  of  ≥300  circulating  eosinophils/μL. 
Additionally, in patients with both diseases, earlier initiation of anti-
cholinergics may be considered.

 ■ ASPIRIN-EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE
A  subset  of  patients  (5–10%)  present  in  adulthood  with  difficult-to-
control  asthma  and  type  2  inflammation  with  eosinophilia,  sinusitis, 
nasal polyposis, and severe asthma exacerbations that are precipitated 
by  ingesting  inhibitors  of  cyclooxygenase,  with  aspirin  being  the 
most  prominent  of  such  inhibitors.  Such  patients,  classified  as  hav-
ing aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, overproduce leukotrienes 
in  response  to  inhibition  of  cyclooxygenase-1,  probably  secondary 
to  inhibition  of  PGE2.  These  patients  should  avoid  inhibitors  of 
cyclooxygenase-1,  (aspirin  and  NSAIDs)  but  can  generally  tolerate 
inhibitors  of  cyclooxygenase-2  and  acetaminophen.  They  should  be 
treated  with  leukotriene  modifiers.  Aspirin  desensitization  can  be 
undertaken  to  decrease  upper  respiratory  symptoms  and  to  allow 
chronic  administration  of  aspirin  or  NSAIDs  for  those  that  require 
it. Dupilumab and the IL-5–active biologics appear to be particularly 
helpful and appear to be superseding aspirin desensitization in man-
agement except when chronic administration of aspirin or NSAIDs is 
required for another therapeutic indication.

288 Hypersensitivity  
Pneumonitis and  
Pulmonary Infiltrates with 
Eosinophilia
Praveen Akuthota, Michael E. Wechsler

HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS
 ■ INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITION
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), also referred to as extrinsic aller-
gic  alveolitis,  is  a  pulmonary  disease  that  occurs  due  to  inhalational 
exposure to a variety of antigens leading to an inflammatory response 
of the alveoli and small airways. Systemic manifestations such as fever 
and  fatigue  can  accompany  respiratory  symptoms.  Although  sensiti-
zation to an inhaled antigen as manifested by specific circulating IgG 
antibodies is necessary for the development of HP, sensitization alone 
is not sufficient as a defining characteristic, because many sensitized 
individuals do not develop HP. The incidence and prevalence of HP are 
variable, depending on geography, occupation, avocation, and environ-
ment of the cohort being studied. As yet unexplained is the decreased 
risk of developing HP in smokers.

 ■ OFFENDING ANTIGENS
HP can be caused by any of a large list of potential offending inhaled 
antigens (Table 288-1). The various antigens and environmental con-
ditions  described  to  be  associated  with  HP  give  rise  to  an  expansive 
list of monikers given to specific forms of HP. Antigens derived from 
fungal,  bacterial,  mycobacterial,  bird-derived,  and  chemical  sources 
have all been implicated in causing HP.

Categories  of  individuals  at  particular  risk  in  the  United  States 
include  farmers,  bird  owners,  industrial  workers,  and  hot  tub  users. 
Farmer’s lung occurs as a result of exposure to one of several possible 
sources  of  bacterial  or  fungal  antigens  such  as  grain,  moldy  hay,  or 
silage.  Potential  offending  antigens  include  thermophilic  actinomy-
cetes  or  Aspergillus  species.  Bird  fancier’s  lung  (also  referred  to  by 
names corresponding to specific birds) must be considered in patients 
who give a history of keeping birds in their home and is precipitated 
by exposure to antigens derived from feathers, droppings, and serum 
proteins.  Occupational  exposure  to  birds  may  also  cause  HP,  as  is 
seen in poultry worker’s lung. Chemical worker’s lung is provoked by 
exposure to occupational chemical antigens such as diphenylmethane 
diisocyanate  and  toluene  diisocyanate.  Mycobacteria  may  cause  HP 
rather than frank infection, a phenomenon observed in hot tub lung 
and in HP due to metalworking fluid.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
While much remains to be learned regarding the pathophysiology of 
HP, it has been established that HP is an immune-mediated condition 
that  occurs  in  response  to  inhaled  antigens  that  are  small  enough 
to  deposit  in  distal  airways  and  alveoli.  From  an  immunologic  per-
spective, HP is characterized by dysregulated TH1 and TH17 immune 
responses.  Although  the  presence  of  precipitating  IgG  antibodies 
against specific antigens in HP suggests a prominent role for adaptive 
immunity in the pathophysiology of HP, innate immune mechanisms 
likely also make an important contribution. This is highlighted by the 
observation  that  Toll-like  receptors  and  downstream  signaling  pro-
teins such as MyD88 are activated in HP, leading to neutrophil recruit-
ment.  Although  no  clear  genetic  basis  for  HP  has  been  established, 
in  specific  cohorts,  polymorphisms  in  genes  involved  in  antigen 
processing  and  presentation,  including  TAP1  and  major  histocom-
patibility complex type II, have been observed. In chronic HP, bone 
marrow–derived fibrocytes may contribute to lung inflammation and  
fibrosis.

 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Given  the  heterogeneity  among  patients,  variability  in  offending 
antigens, and differences in the intensity and duration of exposure to 
antigen, the presentation of HP is accordingly variable. Although these 
categories are not fully satisfactory in capturing this variability, HP has 
been  traditionally  categorized  as  having  acute,  subacute,  and  chronic 
forms.  Acute  HP  usually  manifests  itself  4–8  h  following  exposure 
to  the  inciting  antigen,  often  intense  in  nature.  Systemic  symptoms,

including fevers, chills, and malaise, are prominent and are accompa-
nied by dyspnea. Symptoms resolve within hours to days if no further 
exposure  to  the  offending  antigen  occurs.  In  subacute  HP  resulting 
from ongoing antigen exposure, the onset of respiratory and systemic 
symptoms is typically more gradual over the course of weeks. A sim-
ilar presentation may occur as a culmination of intermittent episodes 
of  acute  HP.  Although  respiratory  impairment  may  be  quite  severe, 
antigen avoidance generally results in resolution of the symptoms, but 
with a slower time course, on the order of weeks to months, than that 
seen with acute HP. Chronic HP can present with an even more grad-
ual  onset  of  symptoms  than  subacute  HP,  with  progressive  dyspnea, 
cough,  fatigue,  weight  loss,  and  clubbing  of  the  digits.  The  insidious 
onset of symptoms and frequent lack of an anteceding episode of acute 
HP  make  diagnosing  chronic  HP  a  challenge.  Unlike  with  the  other 
forms of HP, there can be an irreversible component to the respiratory 
impairment that is not responsive to removal of the responsible antigen 
from the patient’s environment. The disease progression of chronic HP 
to lung fibrosis with honeycombing on chest imaging and hypoxemic 
respiratory failure can mirror that seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibro-
sis  (IPF),  with  a  similar  prognosis.  Diagnostic  uncertainty  between 
these two entities is not uncommon. Fibrotic lung disease is a potential 
feature  of  chronic  HP  due  to  exposure  to  bird  antigens,  whereas  an 
emphysematous phenotype may be seen in farmer’s lung.

The categories of acute, subacute, and chronic HP are not completely 
sufficient in classifying HP. The HP Study Group found on cluster anal-
ysis that a cohort of HP patients is best described in bipartite fashion, 
with one group featuring recurrent systemic signs and symptoms and 
the  other  featuring  more  severe  respiratory  findings.  Some  experts 
have argued for a reclassification of HP into acute/inflammatory and 
chronic/fibrotic categories.

Concordant  with  the  variability  in  the  presentation  of  HP  is  the 
observed variability in outcome. HP that has not progressed to chronic 
lung  disease  has  a  more  favorable  outcome  with  likely  resolution  if 
antigen avoidance can be achieved. However, chronic HP resulting in 
lung fibrosis has a poorer prognosis, with patients with chronic pigeon 
breeder’s lung having demonstrated a similar mortality as seen in IPF.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Although there is no set of universally accepted criteria for arriving at 
a diagnosis of HP, diagnosis depends foremost on establishing a history 
of exposure to an offending antigen that correlates with respiratory and 
systemic symptoms. A careful occupational and home exposure history 
should be taken and may be supplemented if necessary by a clinician 
visit to the work or home environment. Specific inquiries will be influ-
enced  by  geography  and  the  occupation  of  the  patient.  When  HP  is 
suspected by history, the additional workup is aimed at establishing an 
immunologic and physiologic response to inhalational antigen expo-
sure with chest imaging, pulmonary function testing (PFT), serologic 
studies, bronchoscopy, and, on occasion, lung biopsy. Re-exposure to 
the offending environment may be performed to aid in confirming the 
diagnosis of HP.

Chest Imaging  Chest x-ray findings in HP are nonspecific and can 
even lack any discernible abnormalities. In cases of acute and subacute 
HP, findings may be transient and can include ill-defined micronod-
ular  opacities  or  hazy  ground-glass  airspace  opacities.  Findings  on 
chest x-ray will often resolve with removal from the offending antigen, 
although the time course of resolution may vary. With chronic HP, the 
abnormalities seen on the chest radiograph are frequently more fibrotic 
in nature and may be difficult to distinguish from IPF.

High-resolution  computed  tomography  (HRCT)  is  a  common 
component in the diagnostic workup for HP. Although the HRCT may 
be normal in acute forms of HP, this may be due to lack of temporal 
correlation between exposure to the offending antigen and obtaining 
the  imaging.  Additionally,  because  of  the  transient  nature  of  acute 
HP, HRCT is not always performed. In subacute forms of the disease, 
ground-glass  airspace  opacities  are  characteristic,  as  is  the  presence 
of  centrilobular  nodules.  Expiratory  images  may  show  areas  of  air 
trapping  that  are  likely  caused  by  involvement  of  the  small  airways  

FIGURE  288-1  Chest  computed  tomography  scan  of  a  patient  with  subacute 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis in which scattered regions of ground-glass infiltrates 
in a mosaic pattern consistent with air trapping are seen bilaterally. This patient had 
bird fancier’s lung. (Courtesy of TJ Gross; with permission.)

(Fig.  288-1).  Reticular  changes  and  traction  bronchiectasis  can  be 
observed in chronic HP. Subpleural honeycombing similar to that seen 
in IPF may be present in advanced cases, although unlike in IPF, the 
lung bases are frequently spared.

Pulmonary  Function  Testing  Either  restrictive  or  obstructive 
PFTs can be present in HP, so the pattern of PFT change is not useful 
in establishing the diagnosis of HP. However, obtaining PFTs is of use 
in characterizing the physiologic impairment of an individual patient 
and in gauging the response to antigen avoidance and/or corticosteroid 
therapy. Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide may be significantly 
impaired, particularly in cases of chronic HP with fibrotic pulmonary 
parenchymal changes.

Serum  Precipitins  Assaying  for  IgG  antibodies  against  specific 
antigens,  either  through  precipitin  testing  or  direct  serum  measure-
ment, can be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of HP. However, the pres-
ence of an immunologic response alone is not sufficient for establishing 
the diagnosis, because many asymptomatic individuals with high levels 
of exposure to antigen may display specific IgG, as has been observed 
in farmers and in pigeon breeders. It should also be noted that pan-
els  that  test  for  several  specific  antigens  often  provide  false-negative 
results, because they represent an extremely limited proportion of the 
universe of potential offending environmental antigens.

Bronchoscopy  Bronchoscopy  with  bronchoalveolar  lavage  (BAL) 
may be used in the evaluation of HP. Although not a specific finding, 
BAL lymphocytosis is characteristic of HP. However, in active smokers, 
a  lower  threshold  should  be  used  to  establish  BAL  lymphocytosis, 
because  smoking  will  result  in  lower  lymphocyte  percentages.  Most 
cases of HP have a CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio of <1, but again, this 
is not a specific finding and has limited utility in the diagnosis of HP.

Lung Biopsy  Tissue samples may be obtained by a bronchoscopic 
approach using transbronchial biopsy, or more architecturally preserved 
specimens  may  be  obtained  by  a  surgical  approach  (video-assisted 
thoracoscopy or open approach). As is the case with BAL, histologic 
specimens  are  not  absolutely  necessary  to  establish  the  diagnosis  of 
HP, but they can be useful in the correct clinical context. A common 
histologic feature in HP is the presence of noncaseating granulomas in 
the  vicinity  of  small  airways  (Fig. 288-2).  As  opposed  to  pulmonary 
sarcoidosis,  in  which  noncaseating  granulomas  are  well  defined,  the 
granulomas seen in HP are loose and poorly defined in nature. Within 
the alveolar spaces and in the interstitium, a mixed cellular infiltrate 
with a lymphocytic predominance is observed that is frequently patchy

ventilation.  Personal  protective  equipment  including  respirators 
and ventilated helmets can be used but may not provide adequate 
protection for sensitized individuals. In some cases, fully avoiding 
specific  environments  may  be  necessary,  although  such  a  recom-
mendation must be balanced against the effects to an individual’s 
lifestyle  or  occupation.  It  is  not  uncommon  for  patients  with  HP 
due to exposure to household birds to be unwilling to remove them 
from the home.

Because acute HP is generally a self-limited disease after a dis-
crete  exposure  to  an  offending  antigen,  pharmacologic  therapy  is 
generally not necessary. However, in so-called subacute and chronic 
forms  of  the  disease,  there  is  a  role  for  glucocorticoid  therapy.  In 
patients with particularly severe symptoms as a result of subacute 
HP,  antigen  avoidance  may  be  insufficient  after  establishing  the 
diagnosis.  Although  glucocorticoids  do  not  change  the  long-term 
outcome  in  these  patients,  they  can  accelerate  the  resolution  of 
symptoms. While there is significant variability in the approach to 
glucocorticoid  therapy  by  individual  clinicians,  prednisone  ther-
apy  can  be  initiated  at  0.5–1  mg/kg  of  ideal  body  weight  per  day 
(not  to  exceed  60  mg/d  or  alternative  glucocorticoid  equivalent) 
over  a  duration  of  1–2  weeks,  followed  by  a  taper  over  the  next   
2–6 weeks. In chronic HP, a similar trial of corticosteroids may be 
used,  although  a  variable  component  of  fibrotic  disease  may  be 
irreversible. In advanced cases of chronic HP with extensive lung 
fibrosis, lung transplantation may be necessary.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
As the ever-expanding list of antigens and exposures associated with 
the development of HP suggests, populations at risk for HP will vary 
globally  based  on  specifics  of  local  occupational,  avocational,  and 
environmental factors. Specific examples of geographically limited HP 
include summer-type pneumonitis seen in Japan and suberosis seen in 
cork workers in Portugal and Spain.

PULMONARY INFILTRATES WITH 
EOSINOPHILIA
Although  eosinophils  are  normal  constituents  of  the  lungs,  there  are 
several  pulmonary  eosinophilic  syndromes  that  are  characterized  by 
pulmonary infiltrates on imaging along with an increased number of 
eosinophils in lung tissue, in sputum, and/or in BAL fluid, with resul-
tant  increased  respiratory  symptoms  and  the  potential  for  systemic 
manifestations.  Because  the  eosinophil  plays  such  an  important  role 
in each of these syndromes, it is often difficult to distinguish between 
them,  but  there  are  important  clinical  and  pathologic  differences  as 
well as differences in prognosis and treatment paradigms.

 ■ CLASSIFYING PULMONARY INFILTRATES WITH 
EOSINOPHILIA AND GENERAL APPROACH
Because  there  are  so  many  different  diagnoses  associated  with  pul-
monary  infiltrates  with  eosinophilia,  the  first  step  in  classifying  pul-
monary  eosinophilic  syndromes  is  distinguishing  between  primary 
pulmonary  eosinophilic  lung  disorders  and  those  with  eosinophilia 
that are secondary to a specific cause such as a drug reaction, an infec-
tion, a malignancy, or another pulmonary condition such as asthma.  
Table  288-2  lists  primary  and  secondary  pulmonary  eosinophilic 
disorders.

For each patient, a detailed history is of utmost importance and can 
help  elucidate  what  the  underlying  disease  is.  Details  regarding  onset, 
timing, and precipitants of specific symptoms can help discern one diag-
nosis from another. History regarding pharmacologic, occupational, and 
environmental exposures is instructive, and family and travel history are 
crucial. In addition to details about the sinuses and lungs, it is important 
to inquire about systemic manifestations and assess for physical find-
ings  of  cardiac,  gastrointestinal  (GI),  neurologic,  dermatologic,  and 
genitourinary involvement, all of which may give clues to specific diag-
noses. Once the details from history and physical are teased out, labo-
ratory testing (including measurements of blood eosinophils, cultures, 
and markers of inflammation), spirometry, and radiographic imaging 

FIGURE  288-2  Open-lung  biopsy  from  a  patient  with  subacute  hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis  demonstrating  a  loose,  nonnecrotizing  granuloma  made  up  of 
histiocytes  and  multinucleated  giant  cells.  Peribronchial  inflammatory  infiltrate

in distribution. Bronchiolitis with the presence of organizing exudate 
is also often observed. Fibrosis may be present as well, particularly in 
chronic HP. Fibrotic changes may be focal but can be diffuse and severe 
with honeycombing in advanced cases, similar to findings in IPF.

Clinical Prediction Rule  Although not meant as a set of validated 
diagnostic criteria, a clinical prediction rule for predicting the presence 
of HP has been published by the HP Study Group. They identified six 
statistically  significant  predictors  for  HP,  the  strongest  of  which  was 
exposure  to  an  antigen  known  to  cause  HP.  Other  predictive  criteria 
were  the  presence  of  serum  precipitins,  recurrent  symptoms,  symp-
toms occurring 4–8 h after antigen exposure, crackles on inspiration, 
and weight loss.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Differentiating HP from other conditions that cause a similar constella-
tion of respiratory and systemic symptoms requires an increased index 
of  suspicion  based  on  obtaining  a  history  of  possible  exposure  to  an 
offending antigen. Presentations of acute or subacute HP can be mis-
taken for respiratory infection. In cases of chronic disease, HP must be 
differentiated from interstitial lung disease, such as IPF or nonspecific 
interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP); this can be a difficult task even with 
lung  biopsy.  Given  the  presence  of  pulmonary  infiltrates  and  nonca-
seating granulomas on biopsy, sarcoidosis is also a consideration in the 
differential diagnosis of HP. Unlike in HP, however, hilar adenopathy 
may be prominent on chest x-ray, organs other than the lung may be 
involved, and noncaseating granulomas in pathologic specimens tend 
to be well formed. Other inhalational syndromes, such as organic toxic 
dust  syndrome  (OTDS),  can  be  misdiagnosed  as  HP.  OTDS  occurs 
with  exposure  to  organic  dusts,  including  those  produced  by  grains 
or mold silage, but neither requires prior antigen sensitization nor is 
characterized by positive specific IgG antibodies.

TREATMENT
Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis

The mainstay of treatment for HP is antigen avoidance, if possible. 
A careful exposure history must be obtained to attempt to identify 
the potential offending antigen and to identify the location where 
a  patient  is  exposed.  Once  a  potential  antigen  and  location  are 
identified,  efforts  should  be  made  to  modify  the  environment  to 
minimize patient exposure. This may be accomplished with mea-
sures  such  as  removal  of  birds,  removal  of  molds,  and  improved

can help distinguish between different diseases. Often, however, BAL, 
transbronchial,  or  open  lung  biopsies  are  required.  In  many  cases, 
biopsies or noninvasive diagnostic studies of other organs (e.g., echoc-
ardiogram, electromyogram, or bone marrow biopsy) can be helpful.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Pathologically,  the  pulmonary  eosinophilic  syndromes  are  character-
ized by tissue infiltration by eosinophils (Fig. 288-2). In eosinophilic 
granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis  (EGPA),  extravascular  granulomas 
and  necrotizing  vasculitis  may  occur  in  the  lungs,  as  well  as  in  the 
heart, skin, muscle, liver, spleen, and kidneys, and may be associated 
with fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis.

The  exact  etiology  of  the  various  pulmonary  eosinophilic  syn-
dromes is unknown; however, it is felt that these syndromes result from 
dysregulated eosinophilopoiesis or an autoimmune process because of 
the prominence of allergic features and the presence of immune com-
plexes, heightened T-cell immunity, and altered humoral immunity as 
evidenced  by  elevated  IgE,  IgG4,  and  rheumatoid  factor.  Because  of 
its integral involvement in eosinophilopoiesis, interleukin 5 (IL-5) has 
been  hypothesized  to  play  an  etiologic  role.  Monoclonal  antibodies 
against IL-5 are now in clinical use for the treatment of eosinophilic 
asthma  and  eosinophilic  granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis  and  are 
under  investigation  for  other  conditions  characterized  by  pulmonary 
infiltrates  with  eosinophilia.  Antineutrophil  cytoplasmic  antibodies 
(ANCAs) are present in about one-third to two-thirds of patients with 
EGPA; binding of ANCAs to vascular walls likely contributes to vascu-
lar inflammation and injury as well as chemotaxis of inflammatory cells.

 ■ ACUTE EOSINOPHILIC PNEUMONIA
Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a syndrome characterized by fevers, 
acute  respiratory  failure  that  often  requires  mechanical  ventilation,

diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and pulmonary eosinophilia in a previ-
ously healthy individual (Table 288-3).

Clinical  Features  and  Etiology  At  presentation,  acute  eosin-
ophilic  pneumonia  is  often  mistaken  for  acute  lung  injury  or  acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), until a BAL is performed and 
reveals  >25%  eosinophils.  Although  the  predominant  symptoms  of 
acute eosinophilic pneumonia are cough, dyspnea, malaise, myalgias, 
night  sweats,  and  pleuritic  chest  pain,  physical  examination  findings 
include  high  fevers,  basilar  rales,  and  rhonchi  on  forced  expiration. 
Acute  eosinophilic  pneumonia  most  often  affects  males  between  age 
20 and 40 with no history of asthma. Although no clear etiology has 
been  identified,  several  case  reports  have  linked  acute  eosinophilic 
pneumonia to recent initiation of tobacco smoking or even electronic 
cigarette inhalation (vaping), or exposure to other environmental stim-
uli including dust from indoor renovations.

In addition to a suggestive history, the key to establishing a diagnosis 
of acute eosinophilic pneumonia is the presence of >25% eosinophilia 
on BAL fluid. While lung biopsies show eosinophilic infiltration with 
acute and organizing diffuse alveolar damage, it is generally not nec-
essary to proceed to biopsy to establish a diagnosis. Although patients 
present  with  an  elevated  white  blood  cell  count,  in  contrast  to  other 
pulmonary  eosinophilic  syndromes,  acute  eosinophilic  pneumonia  is 
often  not  associated  with  peripheral  eosinophilia  upon  presentation. 
However, between 7 and 30 days of disease onset, peripheral eosino-
philia often occurs with mean eosinophil counts of 1700. Erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, and IgE levels are high 
but nonspecific, whereas HRCT is always abnormal with bilateral ran-
dom patchy ground-glass or reticular opacities and small pleural effu-
sions in as many as two-thirds of patients. Pleural fluid is characterized 
by a high pH with marked eosinophilia.

Clinical  Course  and  Response  to  Therapy  Although  some 
patients  improve  spontaneously,  most  patients  require  admission  to 
an  intensive  care  unit  and  respiratory  support  with  either  invasive 
(intubation)  or  noninvasive  mechanical  ventilation.  However,  what 
distinguishes acute eosinophilic pneumonia from both other cases of 
acute lung injury as well as some of the other pulmonary eosinophilic 
syndromes is the absence of organ dysfunction or multisystem organ 
failure other than respiratory failure. One of the characteristic features 
of  acute  eosinophilic  pneumonia  is  the  high  degree  of  corticosteroid 
responsiveness  and  the  excellent  prognosis.  Another  distinguishing 
feature of acute eosinophilic pneumonia is that complete clinical and 
radiographic recovery without recurrence or residual sequelae occurs 
in almost all patients within several weeks of initiation of therapy.

 ■ CHRONIC EOSINOPHILIC PNEUMONIA
In  contrast  to  acute  eosinophilic  pneumonia,  chronic  eosinophilic 
pneumonia is a more indolent syndrome that is characterized by pul-
monary infiltrates and eosinophilia in both the tissue and blood. Most 
patients are female nonsmokers with a mean age of 45, and patients do 
not usually develop the acute respiratory failure and significant hypox-
emia appreciated in acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Similar to EGPA, a 
majority have asthma, with many having a history of allergies.

Patients present with a subacute illness over weeks to months, with 
cough,  low-grade  fevers,  progressive  dyspnea,  weight  loss,  wheezing, 
malaise,  and  night  sweats,  and  a  chest  x-ray  with  migratory  bilateral 
peripheral  or  pleural-based  opacities.  Although  this  “photographic

2164 negative pulmonary edema” appearance on chest x-ray and chest CT is 
pathognomonic of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, <25% of patients 
present with this finding. Other radiographic findings include atelec-
tasis, pleural effusions, lymphadenopathy, and septal line thickening.

Almost  90%  of  patients  have  peripheral  eosinophilia,  with  mean 
eosinophil  counts  of  over  30%  of  total  white  blood  cell  count.  BAL 
eosinophilia  is  also  an  important  distinguishing  feature  with  mean 
BAL eosinophil counts of ~60%. Both peripheral and BAL eosinophilia 
are  very  responsive  to  treatment  with  corticosteroids.  Other  labora-
tory  features  of  chronic  eosinophilic  pneumonia  include  increased 
ESR,  C-reactive  protein,  platelets,  and  IgE.  Lung  biopsy  is  also  often 
not  required  to  establish  a  diagnosis  but  may  show  accumulation  of 
eosinophils and histiocytes in the lung parenchyma and interstitium, 
as well as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, but with minimal fibro-
sis.  Nonrespiratory  manifestations  are  uncommon,  but  arthralgias, 
neuropathy, and skin and GI symptoms have all been reported; their 
presence may suggest EGPA or a hypereosinophilic syndrome. Another 
similarity is the rapid response to corticosteroids with quick resolution 
of peripheral and BAL eosinophilia and improvement in symptoms. In 
contrast  to  acute  eosinophilic  pneumonia,  though,  >50%  of  patients 
relapse,  and  many  require  prolonged  courses  of  corticosteroids  for 
months to years.

 ■ EOSINOPHILIC GRANULOMATOSIS WITH 
POLYANGIITIS (EGPA)
Previously known as allergic angiitis granulomatosis or Churg-Strauss 
syndrome,  this  complex  syndrome  is  characterized  by  eosinophilic 
vasculitis that may involve multiple organ systems including the lungs, 
heart, skin, GI tract, and nervous system. Although EGPA is charac-
terized  by  peripheral  and  pulmonary  eosinophilia  with  infiltrates  on 
chest  x-ray,  the  primary  features  that  distinguish  EGPA  from  other 
pulmonary  eosinophilic  syndromes  are  the  presence  of  eosinophilic 
vasculitis  in  the  setting  of  asthma  and  involvement  of  multiple  end 
organs (a feature it shares with hypereosinophilic syndrome). Although 
perceived to be quite rare, in the last few years, there has appeared to be 
an increased incidence of this disease, particularly in association with 
various  asthma  therapies,  including  leukotriene  modifiers  and  anti-
IGE  therapy  with  omalizumab,  possibly  due  to  concurrent  systemic 
corticosteroid withdrawal (forme fruste EGPA).

The primary features of EGPA include asthma, peripheral eosino-
philia, neuropathy, pulmonary infiltrates, paranasal sinus abnormality, 
and presence of eosinophilic vasculitis. The mean age at diagnosis is  
48  years,  with  a  range  of  14–74  years;  the  average  length  of  time 
between diagnosis of asthma and vasculitis is 9 years. EGPA typically 
occurs  in  several  phases.  The  prodromal  phase  is  characterized  by 
asthma  and  allergic  rhinitis,  and  usually  begins  when  the  individual 
is in his or her twenties or thirties, typically persisting for many years. 
The eosinophilic infiltrative phase is characterized by peripheral eosin-
ophilia and eosinophilic tissue infiltration of various organs including 
the lungs and GI tract. The third phase is the vasculitic phase and may 
be associated with constitutional signs and symptoms including fever, 
weight loss, malaise, and fatigue. This phasic progression supports the 
hypothesis that there is a pathophysiologic continuum between eosin-
ophilic asthma, chronic eosinophilic asthma, and EGPA.

Similar to other pulmonary eosinophilic syndromes, constitutional 
symptoms  are  very  common  in  EGPA  and  include  weight  loss  of  
10–20  lb,  fevers,  and  diffuse  myalgias  and  migratory  polyarthralgias. 
Myositis  may  be  present  with  evidence  of  vasculitis  on  muscle  biop-
sies. In contrast to the eosinophilic pneumonias, EGPA involves many 
organ  systems  including  the  lungs,  skin,  nerves,  heart,  GI  tract,  and 
kidneys.

Symptoms  and  Clinical  Manifestations 
Most EGPA patients have asthma that arises later in life and in indi-
viduals who have no family history of atopy. The asthma can often be 
severe, and oral corticosteroids are often required to control symptoms 
but may lead to suppression of vasculitic symptoms. In addition to the 
more  common  symptoms  of  cough,  dyspnea,  sinusitis,  and  allergic 
rhinitis, alveolar hemorrhage and hemoptysis may also occur.

•  RESPIRATORY   

NEUROLOGIC  Over three-fourths of EGPA patients have neurologic 
manifestations. Mononeuritis multiplex most commonly involves the 
peroneal  nerve,  but  also  involves  the  ulnar,  radial,  internal  popliteal, 
and occasionally, cranial nerves. Cerebral hemorrhage and infarction 
may also occur and are important causes of death. Despite treatment, 
neurologic sequelae often do not completely resolve.

DERMATOLOGIC  Approximately  half  of  EGPA  patients  develop  der-
matologic manifestations. These include palpable purpura, skin nod-
ules, urticarial rashes, and livedo.
CARDIOVASCULAR  Granulomas,  vasculitis,  and  widespread  myocar-
dial damage may be found on biopsy or at autopsy, and cardiomyop-
athy and heart failure may be seen in up to half of all patients but are 
often at least partially reversible. Acute pericarditis, constrictive peri-
carditis, myocardial infarction, and other electrocardiographic changes 
all may occur. The heart is a primary target organ in EGPA, and cardiac 
involvement often portends a worse prognosis.
GI  GI symptoms are common in EGPA and likely represent an eos-
inophilic gastroenteritis characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, GI 
bleeding,  and  colitis.  Ischemic  bowel,  pancreatitis,  and  cholecystitis 
have also been reported in association with EGPA and usually portend 
a worse prognosis.
RENAL  Renal involvement is more common than once thought, and 
~25%  of  patients  have  some  degree  of  renal  involvement.  This  may 
include proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, renal insufficiency, and rarely, 
renal infarct.

Lab Abnormalities  Systemic eosinophilia is the hallmark labora-
tory finding in patients with EGPA and reflects the likely pathogenic 
role that the eosinophil plays in this disease. Eosinophilia >10% is one 
of the defining features of this illness and may be as high as 75% of the 
peripheral white blood cell count. It is present at the time of diagnosis 
in >80% of patients, but may respond quickly (often within 24 h) to 
initiation  of  systemic  corticosteroid  therapy.  Even  in  the  absence  of 
systemic eosinophilia, tissue eosinophilia may be present.

Although  not  specific  to  EGPA,  ANCAs  are  present  in  approxi-
mately  one-third  to  two-thirds  of  patients,  mostly  in  a  perinuclear 
staining  pattern,  with  specific  antibodies  against  myeloperoxidase 
detected. Nonspecific lab abnormalities that may be present in patients 
with EGPA include a marked elevation in ESR, a normochromic nor-
mocytic anemia, an elevated IgE, hypergammaglobulinemia, and pos-
itive  rheumatoid  factor  and  antinuclear  antibodies  (ANA).  Although 
BAL  often  reveals  significant  eosinophilia,  this  may  be  seen  in  other 
eosinophilic lung diseases. Similarly, PFT often reveals an obstructive 
defect similar to asthma.

Radiographic Features  Chest  x-ray  abnormalities  are  extremely 
common  in  EGPA  and  consist  of  bilateral,  nonsegmental,  patchy 
infiltrates  that  often  migrate  and  may  be  interstitial  or  alveolar  in 
appearance.  Reticulonodular  and  nodular  disease  without  cavitation 
can be seen, as can pleural effusions and hilar adenopathy. The most 
common  CT  findings  include  bilateral  ground-glass  opacity  and 
airspace  consolidation  that  is  predominantly  subpleural.  Other  CT 
findings  include  bronchial  wall  thickening,  hyperinflation,  interlob-
ular septal thickening, lymph node enlargement, and pericardial and 
pleural  effusions.  Angiography  may  be  used  diagnostically  and  may 
show signs of vasculitis in the coronary, central nervous system, and 
peripheral vasculature.

Treatment  and  Prognosis  of  EGPA  Most  patients  diagnosed 
with EGPA have previously been diagnosed with asthma, rhinitis, and 
sinusitis, and have received treatment with inhaled or systemic corti-
costeroids. Because these agents are also the initial treatment of choice 
for EGPA patients, institution of these therapies in patients with EGPA 
who  are  perceived  to  have  severe  asthma  may  delay  the  diagnosis  of 
EGPA  because  signs  of  vasculitis  may  be  masked.  Corticosteroids 
dramatically  alter  the  course  of  EGPA:  up  to  50%  of  those  who  are 
untreated die within 3 months of diagnosis, whereas treated patients 
have  a  6-year  survival  of  >70%.  Common  causes  of  death  include

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemheart  failure,  cerebral  hemorrhage,  renal  failure,  and  GI  bleeding. 
Recent data suggest that clinical remission may be obtained in >90% of 
patients treated; ~25% of those patients may relapse, often due to corti-
costeroid tapering, with a rising eosinophil count heralding the relapse. 
Myocardial,  GI,  and  renal  involvement  most  often  portend  a  poor 
prognosis. In such cases, treatment with higher doses of corticosteroids 
or the addition of cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide is often 
warranted.  Although  survival  does  not  differ  between  those  treated 
or untreated with cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide is associated 
with a reduced incidence of relapse and an improved clinical response 
to treatment. Recent studies examining the efficacy of anti-IL-5 ther-
apy with mepolizumab compared with placebo have shown promise, 
indicating  that  mepolizumab  is  a  safe  and  effective  corticosteroid- 
sparing agent that can reduce relapses. Other therapies that have been 
used  successfully  in  the  management  of  EGPA  include  azathioprine, 
methotrexate,  rituximab,  omalizumab,  intravenous  gamma  globulin, 
and interferon α. Plasma exchange has not been shown to provide any 
additional benefit.

 ■ HYPEREOSINOPHILIC SYNDROMES
Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) constitute a heterogeneous group of 
disease entities manifest by persistent eosinophilia >1500 eosinophils/μL 
in  association  with  end  organ  damage  or  dysfunction,  in  the  absence 
of secondary causes of eosinophilia. In addition to familial, undefined, 
and overlap syndromes with incomplete criteria, the predominant HES 
subtypes  are  the  myeloproliferative  and  lymphocytic  variants.  The 
myeloproliferative  variants  may  have  acquired  genetic  abnormalities, 
including  of  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptor  α  (PDGFRα), 
attributed  to  a  constitutively  activated  tyrosine  kinase  fusion  protein 
(Fip1L1-PDGFRα)  due  to  a  chromosomal  deletion  on  4q12;  this 
variant  is  often  responsive  to  imatinib.  Myeloproliferative  HES  may 
also  be  associated  with  mutations  involving  platelet-derived  growth 
factor β (PDGFRβ), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and fibroblast growth factor 
receptor 1 (FGFR1). Chronic eosinophilic leukemia with demonstrable 
cytogenetic  abnormalities  and/or  blasts  on  peripheral  smear  is  often 
categorized  with  the  myeloproliferative  HES.  Clinical  and  laboratory 
findings  in  myeloproliferative  HES  may  include  dysplastic  peripheral 
eosinophils,  increased  serum  vitamin  B12,  increased  tryptase,  ane-
mia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, bone marrow cellularity >80%,  
spindle-shaped  mast  cells,  and  myelofibrosis.  The  evaluation  for 
lymphocytic  HES  includes  searching  for  abnormal  T-cell  clonal 
populations.

Extrapulmonary  Manifestations  of  HES  More  common  in 
men than in women, HES occurs between the ages of 20 and 50 and 
is characterized by significant extrapulmonary involvement, including 
infiltration of the heart, GI tract, kidney, liver, joints, and skin. Cardiac 
involvement  includes  myocarditis  and/or  endomyocardial  fibrosis,  as 
well as a restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Pulmonary Manifestations of HES  Similar to the other pulmo-
nary eosinophilic syndromes, these HES are manifested by high levels 
of  blood,  BAL,  and  tissue  eosinophilia.  Lung  involvement  occurs  in 
40%  of  these  patients  and  is  characterized  by  cough  and  dyspnea,  as 
well as pulmonary infiltrates. Although it is often difficult to discern 
the pulmonary infiltrates and effusions seen on chest x-ray from pul-
monary edema resulting from cardiac involvement, CT scan findings 
include  interstitial  infiltrates,  ground-glass  opacities,  and  small  nod-
ules. HES are typically not associated with ANCA. IgE may be elevated 
in lymphocytic HES variants.

Course and Response to Therapy  Unlike the other pulmonary 
eosinophilic  syndromes,  less  than  half  of  patients  with  these  HES 
respond to corticosteroids as first-line therapy. Although other treat-
ment  options  include  hydroxyurea,  cyclosporine,  and  interferon,  the 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has emerged as an important ther-
apeutic option for patients with the myeloproliferative variant, partic-
ularly in individuals with the Fip1L1-PDGFRA gene fusion. Anti-IL-5 
therapy  with  mepolizumab  or  benralizumab  also  holds  promise  for 
these patients and is currently being investigated.

 ■ ALLERGIC BRONCHOPULMONARY 
ASPERGILLOSIS
Allergic  bronchopulmonary  aspergillosis  (ABPA)  is  an  eosinophilic 
pulmonary  disorder  that  occurs  in  response  to  allergic  sensitization 
to  antigens  from  Aspergillus  species  fungi.  The  predominant  clinical 
presentation  of  ABPA  is  an  asthmatic  phenotype,  often  accompanied 
by cough with production of brownish plugs of mucus. ABPA has also 
been well described as a complication of cystic fibrosis. A workup for 
ABPA may be beneficial in patients who carry a diagnosis of asthma 
but have proven refractory to usual therapy. ABPA is a distinct diag-
nosis  from  simple  asthma,  characterized  by  prominent  peripheral 
eosinophilia and elevated circulating levels of IgE (often >1000 IU/mL). 
Establishing a diagnosis of ABPA also requires establishing sensitivity 
to Aspergillus antigens by skin test reactivity and/or direct measurement 
of circulating specific IgE to Aspergillus. Positive serum precipitins for 
Aspergillus or direct measurement of circulating specific IgG to Asper-
gillus can be used as an adjunct diagnostic criterion. Central bronchiec-
tasis is described as a classic finding on chest imaging in ABPA but is 
not necessary for making a diagnosis. Other possible findings on chest 
imaging include patchy infiltrates and evidence of mucus impaction.

Systemic  glucocorticoids  may  be  used  in  the  treatment  of  ABPA 
that is persistently symptomatic despite the use of inhaled therapies for 
asthma. Courses of glucocorticoids should be tapered over 3–6 months, 
and their use must be balanced against the risks of prolonged steroid 
therapy. Antifungal agents such as itraconazole and voriconazole given 
over a 4-month course reduce the antigenic stimulus in ABPA and may 
therefore  modulate  disease  activity  in  selected  patients.  Newer  azole 
agents may be used as well. The use of monoclonal antibody against IgE 
(omalizumab) has been described in treating severe ABPA, particularly 
in  individuals  with  ABPA  as  a  complication  of  cystic  fibrosis.  Other 
monoclonal  antibodies  used  in  severe  eosinophilic  asthma,  such  as 
those targeting IL-5 (or its receptor) or targeting IL-4-receptor-alpha, 
may be considered as well in refractory cases.

ABPA-like syndromes have been reported as a result of sensitization 
to several non-Aspergillus species fungi. However, these conditions are 
substantially rarer than ABPA, which may be present in a significant 
proportion of patients with refractory asthma.

 ■ INFECTIOUS PROCESSES
Infectious  etiologies  of  pulmonary  eosinophilia  are  largely  due  to  hel-
minths and are of particular importance in the evaluation of pulmonary 
eosinophilia  in  tropical  environments  and  in  the  developing  world 
(Table  288-4).  These  infectious  conditions  may  also  be  considered  in 
recent travelers to endemic regions. Loffler syndrome refers to transient 
pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia that occurs in response to pas-
sage of helminthic larvae through the lungs, most commonly larvae of 
Ascaris species (roundworm). Symptoms are generally self-limited and 
may include dyspnea, cough, wheeze, and hemoptysis. Loffler syndrome 
may  also  occur  in  response  to  hookworm  infection  with  Ancylostoma 
duodenale or Necator americanus. Chronic Strongyloides stercoralis infec-
tion can lead to recurrent respiratory symptoms with peripheral eosino-
philia between flares. In immunocompromised hosts, including patients 
on glucocorticoids, a severe, potentially fatal, hyperinfection syndrome 
can  result  from  Strongyloides  infection.  Paragonimiasis,  filariasis,  and 
visceral larval migrans can all cause pulmonary eosinophilia as well.

 ■ DRUGS AND TOXINS
A host of medications are associated with the development of pulmo-
nary infiltrates with peripheral eosinophilia. Therefore, drug reaction 
must always be included in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary eos-
inophilia. Although the list of medications associated with pulmonary 
eosinophilia is ever expanding, common culprits include nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications and systemic antibiotics. Additionally, 
various and diverse environmental exposures such as particulate met-
als,  scorpion  stings,  and  inhalational  drugs  of  abuse  may  also  cause 
pulmonary eosinophilia. Radiation therapy for breast cancer has been 
linked with eosinophilic pulmonary infiltration as well. The mainstay 
of treatment is removal of the offending exposure, although glucocor-
ticoids may be necessary if respiratory symptoms are severe.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
In  the  United  States,  drug-induced  eosinophilic  pneumonias  are  the 
most  common  cause  of  eosinophilic  pulmonary  infiltrates.  A  travel 
history  or  evidence  of  recent  immigration  should  prompt  the  con-
sideration  of  parasite-associated  disorders.  Tropical  eosinophilia  is 
usually caused by filarial infection; however, eosinophilic pneumonias 
also occur with other parasites such as Ascaris spp., Ancylostoma spp., 
Toxocara spp., and Strongyloides stercoralis. Tropical eosinophilia due 
to Wuchereria bancrofti or Wuchereria malayi occurs most commonly 
in southern Asia, Africa, and South America and is treated successfully 
with diethylcarbamazine. In the United States, Strongyloides is endemic 
to the southeastern and Appalachian regions.

289 Occupational and 

Environmental Lung Disease
John R. Balmes

Occupational  and  environmental  lung  diseases  are  difficult  to  dis-
tinguish  from  those  of  nonenvironmental  origin.  Virtually  all  major 
categories  of  pulmonary  disease  can  be  caused  by  environmental 
agents, and environmentally related disease usually presents clinically 
in a manner indistinguishable from that of disease not caused by such 
agents. In addition, the etiology of many diseases may be multifacto-
rial; occupational and environmental factors may interact with other 

factors (such as smoking and genetic risk). It is often only after a care-
ful exposure history is taken that the underlying workplace or general 
environmental exposure is uncovered.

Why  is  knowledge  of  occupational  or  environmental  etiology  so 
important?  Patient  management  and  prognosis  are  affected  signifi-
cantly  by  such  knowledge.  For  example,  patients  with  occupational 
asthma  or  hypersensitivity  pneumonitis  often  cannot  be  managed 
adequately without cessation of exposure to the offending agent. Estab-
lishment of cause may have significant legal and financial implications 
for  a  patient  who  no  longer  can  work  in  his  or  her  usual  job.  Other 
exposed people may be identified as having the disease or prevented 
from  getting  it.  In  addition,  new  associations  between  exposure  and 
disease may be identified (e.g., nylon flock worker’s lung disease and 
diacetyl-induced bronchiolitis obliterans).

Although the exact proportion of lung disease due to occupational 
and environmental factors is unknown, a large number of individuals 
are  at  risk.  For  example,  15–20%  of  the  burden  of  adult  asthma  and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been estimated to 
be due to occupational factors.

 ■ HISTORY AND EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT
The  patient’s  history  is  of  paramount  importance  in  assessing  any 
potential occupational or environmental exposure. Inquiry into specific 
work  practices  should  include  questions  about  the  specific  contami-
nants involved, the presence of visible dusts, chemical odors, the size 
and ventilation of workspaces, the use of respiratory protective equip-
ment,  and  whether  coworkers  have  similar  complaints.  The  temporal 
association  of  exposure  at  work  and  symptoms  may  provide  clues  to 
occupation-related disease. In addition, the patient must be questioned 
about alternative sources of exposure to potentially toxic agents, includ-
ing hobbies, home characteristics, exposure to secondhand smoke, and 
proximity  to  traffic  or  industrial  facilities.  Short-term  and  long-term 
exposures  to  potential  toxic  agents  in  the  distant  past  also  must  be 
considered.

Workers in the United States have the right to know about potential 
hazards  in  their  workplaces  under  federal  Occupational  Safety  and 
Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. Employers must provide 
specific  information  about  potential  hazardous  agents  in  products 
being used through Safety Data Sheets as well as training in personal 
protective equipment and environmental control procedures. However, 
the  introduction  of  new  processes  and/or  new  chemical  compounds 
may change exposure significantly, and often only the employee on the 
production line is aware of the change. For the physician caring for a 
patient  with  a  suspected  work-related  illness,  a  visit  to  the  work  site 
can be very instructive. Alternatively, an affected worker can request an 
inspection by OSHA. If reliable environmental sampling data are avail-
able, that information should be used in assessing a patient’s exposure. 
Because chronic diseases may result from exposure over many years, 
current environmental measurements should be combined with work 
histories to arrive at estimates of past exposure.

 ■ LABORATORY TESTS
Exposures  to  inorganic  and  organic  dusts  can  cause  interstitial  lung 
disease that presents with a restrictive pattern and a decreased diffus-
ing capacity (Chap. 285). Similarly, exposures to a number of dusts or 
chemical  agents  may  result  in  occupational  asthma  or  COPD  that  is 
characterized by airway obstruction. Measurement of change in forced 
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) before and after a working shift can be 
used to detect an acute bronchoconstrictive response.

The  chest  radiograph  is  useful  in  detecting  and  monitoring  the 
pulmonary  response  to  mineral  dusts,  certain  metals,  and  organic 
dusts  capable  of  inducing  hypersensitivity  pneumonitis.  The  Inter-
national  Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  International  Classification  of 
Radiographs  of  Pneumoconioses  classifies  chest  radiographs  by  the 
nature and size of opacities seen and the extent of involvement of the 
parenchyma. In general, small rounded opacities are seen in silicosis 
or  coal  worker’s  pneumoconiosis,  and  small  linear  opacities  are  seen 
in asbestosis. Although useful for epidemiologic studies and screening 
large  numbers  of  workers,  the  ILO  system  can  be  problematic  when 

HPIM21e_Part7_p2131-p2216.indd   2166

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemapplied to an individual worker’s chest radiograph. With dusts causing 
rounded opacities, the degree of involvement on the chest radiograph 
may be extensive, whereas pulmonary function may be only minimally 
impaired.  In  contrast,  in  pneumoconiosis  causing  linear,  irregular 
opacities  like  those  seen  in  asbestosis,  the  radiograph  may  lead  to 
underestimation of the severity of the impairment until relatively late 
in the disease. For patients with a history of asbestos exposure, conven-
tional computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive for the detection 
of  pleural  thickening,  and  high-resolution  CT  (HRCT)  improves  the 
detection of asbestosis.

Other procedures that may be of use in identifying the role of envi-
ronmental exposures in causing lung disease include skin prick testing 
or specific IgE antibody titers for evidence of immediate hypersensi-
tivity  to  agents  capable  of  inducing  occupational  asthma  (e.g.,  flour 
antigens in bakers), specific IgG precipitating antibody titers for agents 
capable of causing hypersensitivity pneumonitis (e.g., pigeon antigen in 
bird handlers), and assays for specific cell-mediated immune responses 
(e.g., beryllium lymphocyte proliferation testing in nuclear workers or 
tuberculin skin testing in health care workers). Sometimes a bronchos-
copy to obtain transbronchial biopsies of lung tissue may be required 
for  histologic  diagnosis  (chronic  beryllium  disease  [CBD]).  Rarely, 
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery to obtain a larger sample of lung 
tissue may be required to determine the specific diagnosis of environ-
mentally induced lung disease (hypersensitivity pneumonitis or giant 
cell interstitial pneumonitis due to cobalt exposure).

 ■ DETERMINANTS OF INHALATIONAL EXPOSURE
The  chemical  and  physical  characteristics  of  inhaled  agents  affect 
both  the  dose  and  the  site  of  deposition  in  the  respiratory  tract. 
Water-soluble gases such as ammonia and sulfur dioxide are absorbed 
in  the  lining  fluid  of  the  upper  and  proximal  airways  and  thus  tend 
to  produce  irritative  and  bronchoconstrictive  responses.  In  contrast, 
nitrogen dioxide and phosgene, which are less soluble, may penetrate 
to the bronchioles and alveoli in sufficient quantities to produce acute 
chemical pneumonitis.

Particle size of air contaminants must also be considered. Because 
of their settling velocities in air, particles >10–15 μm in diameter do 
not  penetrate  beyond  the  nose  and  throat.  Particles  <10  μm  in  size 
are deposited below the larynx. These particles are divided into three 
size  fractions  on  the  basis  of  their  size  characteristics  and  sources. 
Particles ~2.5–10 μm (coarse-mode fraction) contain crustal elements 
such  as  silica,  aluminum,  and  iron.  These  particles  mostly  deposit 
relatively  high  in  the  tracheobronchial  tree.  Although  the  total  mass 
of  an  ambient  sample  is  dominated  by  these  larger  respirable  parti-
cles, the number of particles, and therefore the surface area on which 
potential toxic agents can deposit and be carried to the lower airways, 
is  dominated  by  particles  <2.5  μm  (fine-mode  fraction).  These  fine 
particles  are  created  primarily  by  the  burning  of  fossil  fuels  or  high-
temperature  industrial  processes  resulting  in  condensation  products 
from gases, fumes, or vapors. The smallest particles, those <0.1 μm in 
size, represent the ultrafine fraction and make up the largest number 
of  particles;  they  tend  to  remain  in  the  airstream  and  deposit  in  the 
lung only on a random basis as they come into contact with the alve-
olar walls. If they do deposit, however, particles of this size range may 
penetrate into the circulation and be carried to extrapulmonary sites. 
New technologies create particles of this size (“nanoparticles”) for use 
in  many  commercial  applications.  Besides  the  size  characteristics  of 
particles and the solubility of gases, the actual chemical composition, 
mechanical  properties,  and  immunogenicity  or  infectivity  of  inhaled 
material  determine  in  large  part  the  nature  of  the  diseases  found 
among exposed persons.

2168 workers  involved  in  the  production  of  asbestos  products  (mining, 
milling,  and  manufacturing),  many  workers  in  the  shipbuilding  and 
construction  trades,  including  pipe  fitters  and  boilermakers,  were 
occupationally exposed because asbestos was widely used during the 
twentieth century for its thermal and electrical insulation properties. 
Asbestos  also  was  used  in  the  manufacture  of  fire-resistant  textiles, 
in cement and floor tiles, and in friction materials such as brake and 
clutch linings.

Exposure to asbestos is not limited to persons who directly handle 
the material. Cases of asbestos-related diseases have been encountered 
in individuals with only bystander exposure, such as painters and elec-
tricians who worked alongside insulation workers in a shipyard. Com-
munity  exposure  resulted  from  the  use  of  asbestos-containing  mine 
and mill tailings as landfill, road surface, and playground material (e.g., 
Libby, MT, the site of a vermiculite mine in which the ore was contami-
nated with asbestos). Finally, exposure can occur from the disturbance 
of naturally occurring asbestos (e.g., from increasing residential devel-
opment in the foothills of the Sierra Mountains in California).

Asbestos has largely been replaced in the developed world with syn-
thetic mineral fibers such as fiberglass and refractory ceramic fibers, but 
it continues to be used in the developing world. The major health effects 
from exposure to asbestos are pleural and pulmonary fibrosis, cancers 
of the respiratory tract, and pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma.

Asbestosis is a diffuse interstitial fibrosing disease of the lung that is 
directly related to the intensity and duration of exposure. The disease 
resembles other forms of diffuse interstitial fibrosis (Chap. 293). Usu-
ally,  exposure  has  taken  place  for  at  least  10  years  before  the  disease 
becomes  manifest.  The  mechanisms  by  which  asbestos  fibers  induce 
lung fibrosis are not completely understood but are known to involve 
oxidative  injury  due  to  the  generation  of  reactive  oxygen  species  by 
the transition metals on the surface of the fibers as well as from cells 
engaged in phagocytosis.

Past exposure to asbestos is specifically indicated by pleural plaques 
on  chest  radiographs,  which  are  characterized  by  either  thickening 
or calcification along the parietal pleura, particularly along the lower 
lung fields, the diaphragm, and the cardiac border. Without additional 
manifestations,  pleural  plaques  imply  only  exposure,  not  pulmonary 
impairment. Benign pleural effusions also may occur.

Irregular or linear opacities that usually are first noted in the lower 
lung fields are the chest radiographic hallmark of asbestosis. An indis-
tinct heart border or a “ground-glass” appearance in the lung fields may 
be  seen.  HRCT  may  show  distinct  changes  of  subpleural  curvilinear 
lines 5–10 mm in length that appear to be parallel to the pleural surface 
(Fig. 289-1).

Pulmonary function testing in asbestosis reveals a restrictive pattern 
with a decrease in both lung volumes and diffusing capacity. There may 
also  be  evidence  of  mild  airflow  obstruction  (due  to  peribronchiolar 
fibrosis).

Because  no  specific  therapy  is  available  for  asbestosis,  supportive 
care  is  the  same  as  that  given  to  any  patient  with  diffuse  interstitial 
fibrosis  of  any  cause.  In  general,  newly  diagnosed  cases  will  have 
resulted from exposures that occurred many years before.

Lung cancer (Chap. 78) is the most common cancer associated with 
asbestos exposure. The excess frequency of lung cancer (all histologic 
types)  in  asbestos  workers  is  associated  with  a  minimum  latency  of 
15–19  years  between  first  exposure  and  development  of  the  disease. 
Persons with more exposure are at greater risk of disease. In addition, 
there is a significant interactive effect of smoking and asbestos expo-
sure that results in greater risk than what would be expected from the 
additive effect of each factor.

Mesotheliomas  (Chap.  294),  both  pleural  and  peritoneal,  are  also 
associated  with  asbestos  exposure.  In  contrast  to  lung  cancers,  these 
tumors do not appear to be associated with smoking. Relatively short-
term asbestos exposures of ≤1–2 years, occurring up to 40 years in the 
past, have been associated with the development of mesotheliomas (an 
observation  that  emphasizes  the  importance  of  obtaining  a  complete 
environmental exposure history). Although the risk of mesothelioma 
is much less than that of lung cancer among asbestos-exposed workers, 
~3000 cases per year are diagnosed in the United States.

FIGURE  289-1  Asbestosis.  A.  Frontal  chest  radiograph  shows  bilateral  calcified 
pleural  plaques  consistent  with  asbestos-related  pleural  disease.  Poorly  defined 
linear and reticular abnormalities are seen in the lower lobes bilaterally. B. Axial 
high-resolution  computed  tomography  of  the  thorax  obtained  through  the  lung 
bases shows bilateral, subpleural reticulation (black arrows), representing fibrotic 
lung  disease  due  to  asbestosis.  Subpleural  lines  are  also  present  (arrowheads), 
characteristic  of,  though  not  specific  for,  asbestosis.  Calcified  pleural  plaques 
representing asbestos-related pleural disease (white arrows) are also evident.

Because epidemiologic studies have shown that >80% of mesothe-
liomas may be associated with asbestos exposure, documented meso-
thelioma in a patient with occupational or environmental exposure to 
asbestos may be compensable.

Despite being one of the oldest known occupational pulmonary haz-
ards,  free  silica  (SiO2),  or  crystalline  quartz,  is  still  a  major  cause  of 
disease. The major occupational exposures include mining; stonecut-
ting;  sand  blasting;  glass  and  cement  manufacturing;  foundry  work; 
packing  of  silica  flour;  and  quarrying,  particularly  of  granite.  Most 
often, pulmonary fibrosis due to silica exposure (silicosis) occurs in a 
dose-response fashion after many years of exposure. Two recent out-
breaks of silicosis have involved sandblasting of denim jeans to make

FIGURE  289-2  Acute  silicosis.  This  high-resolution  computed  tomography  scan 
shows multiple small nodules consistent with silicosis but also diffuse ground-glass 
densities  with  thickened  intralobular  and  interlobular  septa  producing  polygonal 
shapes. This has been referred to as “crazy paving.”

them look “used,” and manufacture and installation of artificial stone 
(“faux granite”) kitchen countertops.

Workers heavily exposed through sandblasting in confined spaces, 
tunneling  through  rock  with  a  high  quartz  content  (15–25%),  or  the 
manufacture of abrasive soaps may develop acute silicosis with as little 
as 10 months of exposure. The clinical and pathologic features of acute 
silicosis are similar to those of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (Chap. 
293).  The  chest  radiograph  may  show  profuse  miliary  infiltration  or 
consolidation,  and  there  is  a  characteristic  HRCT  pattern  known  as 
“crazy paving” (Fig. 289-2). The disease may be quite severe and pro-
gressive  despite  the  discontinuation  of  exposure.  Whole-lung  lavage 
may provide symptomatic relief and slow the progression.

With  long-term,  less  intense  exposure,  small  rounded  opacities  in 
the upper lobes may appear on the chest radiograph after 15–20 years 
of  exposure,  usually  without  associated  impairment  of  lung  function 
(simple  silicosis).  Calcification  of  hilar  nodes  may  occur  in  as  many 
as 20% of cases and produces a characteristic “eggshell” pattern. Sili-
cotic nodules may be identified more readily by HRCT (Fig. 289-3). 
The  nodular  fibrosis  may  be  progressive  in  the  absence  of  further 
exposure, with coalescence and formation of nonsegmental conglom-
erates  of  irregular  masses  >1  cm  in  diameter  (complicated  silicosis). 
These masses can become quite large, and when this occurs, the term 
progressive  massive  fibrosis  (PMF)  is  applied.  Significant  functional 
impairment with both restrictive and obstructive components may be 
associated with PMF.

Because  silica  causes  alveolar  macrophage  dysfunction,  patients 
with  silicosis  are  at  greater  risk  of  acquiring  lung  infections  that 
involve  these  cells  as  a  primary  defense  (Mycobacterium  tuberculosis, 
atypical  mycobacteria,  and  fungi).  Because  of  the  increased  risk  of 
active tuberculosis, the recommended treatment of latent tuberculosis 
in these patients is longer. Silica has immunoadjuvant properties, and 
another  potential  clinical  complication  of  silicosis  is  autoimmune 
connective  tissue  disorders  such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  sclero-
derma.  In  addition,  there  are  sufficient  epidemiologic  data  that  the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer lists silica as a probable 
lung carcinogen.

Other,  less  hazardous  silicates  include  fuller’s  earth,  kaolin,  mica, 
diatomaceous earths, silica gel, soapstone, carbonate dusts, and cement 

FIGURE  289-3  Chronic  silicosis.  A.  Frontal  chest  radiograph  in  a  patient  with 
silicosis shows variably sized, poorly defined nodules (arrows) predominating in the 
upper lobes. B. Axial thoracic computed tomography image through the lung apices 
shows numerous small nodules, more pronounced in the right upper lobe. A number 
of the nodules are subpleural in location (arrows).

dusts. The production of fibrosis in workers exposed to these agents is 
believed to be related either to the free silica content of these dusts or, 
for substances that contain no free silica, to the potentially large dust 
loads to which these workers may be exposed. Some silicates, including 
talc  and  vermiculite,  may  be  contaminated  with  asbestos.  Fibrosis  of 
lung  or  pleura,  lung  cancer,  and  mesothelioma  have  been  associated 
with chronic exposure to talc and vermiculite dusts.

 ■ COAL WORKER’S PNEUMOCONIOSIS (CWP)
Occupational exposure to coal dust can lead to CWP, which has enor-
mous  social,  economic,  and  medical  significance  in  every  nation  in 
which  coal  mining  is  an  important  industry.  Simple  radiographically 
identified CWP is seen in ~10% of all coal miners and in as many as 
50% of anthracite miners with >20 years of work on the coal face. The 
prevalence of disease is lower in workers in bituminous coal mines.

With  prolonged  exposure  to  coal  dust  (i.e.,  15–20  years),  small, 
rounded opacities similar to those of silicosis may develop. As in sili-
cosis, the presence of these nodules (simple CWP) usually is not asso-
ciated with pulmonary impairment. In addition to CWP, coal dust can 
cause chronic bronchitis and COPD (Chap. 292). The effects of coal 
dust are additive to those of cigarette smoking.

Complicated  CWP  is  manifested  by  the  appearance  on  the  chest 
radiograph  of  nodules  ≥1  cm  in  diameter  generally  confined  to  the 
upper half of the lungs. As in silicosis, this condition can progress to 
PMF that is accompanied by severe lung function deficits and associ-
ated with premature mortality. Despite improvements in technology to 
protect coal miners, cases of PMF still occur in the United States at a 
disturbing rate.

Caplan  syndrome  (Chap.  358),  first  described  in  coal  miners  but 
subsequently in patients with silicosis, is the combination of pneumo-
coniotic nodules and seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. Silica is often 
present in anthracitic coal dust, and its presence may contribute to risk 
of PMF.
 ■ CHRONIC BERYLLIUM DISEASE
Beryllium is a lightweight metal with tensile strength, good electrical 
conductivity,  and  value  in  the  control  of  nuclear  reactions  through 
its  ability  to  quench  neutrons.  Although  beryllium  may  produce  an 
acute pneumonitis, it is far more commonly associated with a chronic 
granulomatous  inflammatory  disease  that  is  similar  to  sarcoidosis  
(Chap.  367).  Unless  one  inquires  specifically  about  occupational 
exposures to beryllium in the manufacture of alloys, ceramics, or high- 
technology  electronics  in  a  patient  with  sarcoidosis,  one  may  miss 
entirely the etiologic relationship to the occupational exposure. What 
distinguishes CBD from sarcoidosis is evidence of a specific cell-medi-
ated immune response (i.e., delayed hypersensitivity) to beryllium.

The test that usually provides this evidence is the beryllium lympho-
cyte proliferation test (BeLPT). The BeLPT compares the in vitro pro-
liferation of lymphocytes from blood or bronchoalveolar lavage in the 
presence of beryllium salts with that of unstimulated cells. Proliferation 
is usually measured by lymphocyte uptake of radiolabeled thymidine.

Chest imaging findings are similar to those of sarcoidosis (nodules 
along septal lines) except that hilar adenopathy is somewhat less com-
mon. As with sarcoidosis, pulmonary function test results may show 
restrictive and/or obstructive ventilatory deficits and decreased diffus-
ing capacity. With early disease, both chest imaging studies and pul-
monary function tests may be normal. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with 
transbronchial lung biopsy usually is required to make the diagnosis of 
CBD. In a beryllium-sensitized individual, the presence of noncaseat-
ing granulomas or monocytic infiltration in lung tissue establishes the 
diagnosis. Accumulation of beryllium-specific CD4+ T cells occurs in 
the granulomatous inflammation seen on lung biopsy. Susceptibility to 
CBD is highly associated with human leukocyte antigen DP (HLA-DP) 
alleles that have a glutamic acid in position 69 of the β chain.
 ■ OTHER METALS
Aluminum and titanium dioxide have been rarely associated with a sar-
coid-like reaction in lung tissue. Exposure to dust containing tungsten 
carbide, also known as “hard metal,” may produce giant cell interstitial 
pneumonitis.  Cobalt  is  a  constituent  of  tungsten  carbide  and  is  the 
likely etiologic agent of both the interstitial pneumonitis and the occu-
pational asthma that may occur. The most common exposures to tung-
sten carbide occur in tool and dye, saw blade, and drill bit manufacture. 
Diamond  polishing  may  also  involve  exposure  to  cobalt  dust.  In 
patients with interstitial lung disease, one should always inquire about 
exposure  to  metal  fumes  and/or  dusts.  Especially  when  sarcoidosis 
appears to be the diagnosis, one should always consider possible CBD.
 ■ OTHER INORGANIC DUSTS
Most of the inorganic dusts discussed thus far are associated with the 
production of either dust macules or interstitial fibrotic changes in the 
lung. Other inorganic and organic dusts (see categories in Table 289-1), 
along with some of the dusts previously discussed, are associated with 
chronic  mucus  hypersecretion  (chronic  bronchitis),  with  or  without 
reduction  of  expiratory  flow  rates.  Cigarette  smoking  is  the  major 
cause of these conditions, and any effort to attribute some component 
of the disease to occupational and environmental exposures must take 
cigarette smoking into account. Most studies suggest an additive effect 
of dust exposure and smoking. The pattern of the irritant dust effect 
is  similar  to  that  of  cigarette  smoking,  suggesting  that  small  airway 
inflammation  may  be  the  initial  site  of  pathologic  response  in  those 
cases  and  continued  exposure  may  lead  to  chronic  bronchitis  and 
COPD.
 ■ ORGANIC DUSTS
Some  of  the  specific  diseases  associated  with  organic  dusts  are  dis-
cussed in detail in the chapters on asthma (Chap. 287) and hypersen-
sitivity  pneumonitis  (Chap.  288).  Many  of  these  diseases  are  named 

for the specific setting in which they are found, e.g., farmer’s lung, malt 
worker’s disease, and mushroom worker’s disease. Often the temporal 
relation of symptoms to exposure furnishes the best evidence for the 
diagnosis. Three occupational exposures are singled out for discussion 
here because they affect the largest proportions of workers.

Cotton  Dust  (Byssinosis)  Workers  occupationally  exposed  to 
cotton dust (but also to flax, hemp, or jute dust) in the production of 
yarns for textiles and rope making are at risk for an asthma-like syn-
drome  known  as  byssinosis.  The  risk  of  byssinosis  is  associated  with 
both cotton dust and endotoxin levels in the workplace environment.

Byssinosis is characterized clinically as occasional (early-stage) and 
then regular (late-stage) chest tightness toward the end of the first day 
of  the  workweek  (“Monday  chest  tightness”).  Exposed  workers  may 
show  a  significant  drop  in  FEV1  over  the  course  of  a  Monday  work-
shift.  Initially  the  symptoms  do  not  recur  on  subsequent  days  of  the 
week, but in a subset of workers, chest tightness may recur or persist 
throughout the workweek. After >10 years of exposure, workers with 
recurrent symptoms are more likely to have an obstructive pattern on 
pulmonary function testing.

Dust  exposure  can  be  reduced  by  the  use  of  exhaust  hoods,  gen-
eral  increases  in  ventilation,  and  wetting  procedures,  but  respiratory 
protective  equipment  may  be  required  during  certain  operations. 
Regular  surveillance  of  pulmonary  function  in  cotton  dust–exposed 
workers using spirometry before and after the workshift is required by 
OSHA. All workers with persistent symptoms or significantly reduced 
levels of pulmonary function should be moved to areas of lower risk 
of exposure.

Grain Dust  Worldwide, many farmers and workers in grain storage 
facilities  are  exposed  to  grain  dust.  The  presentation  of  obstructive 
airway disease in grain dust–exposed workers is virtually identical to 
the characteristic findings in cigarette smokers, i.e., persistent cough, 
mucus hypersecretion, wheeze and dyspnea on exertion, and reduced 
FEV1 and FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio (Chap. 285).

Dust  concentrations  in  grain  elevators  vary  greatly  but  can  be 
>10,000  μg/m3  with  many  particles  in  the  respirable  size  range.  The 
effect of grain dust exposure is additive to that of cigarette smoking, 
with  ~50%  of  workers  who  smoke  having  symptoms.  Smoking  grain 
dust–exposed workers are more likely to have obstructive ventilatory 
deficits  on  pulmonary  function  testing.  As  in  byssinosis,  endotoxin 
may play a role in grain dust–induced chronic bronchitis and COPD.

Farmer’s Lung  This condition results from exposure to moldy hay 
containing spores of thermophilic actinomycetes that produce a hyper-
sensitivity  pneumonitis  (Chap.  288).  A  patient  with  acute  farmer’s 
lung  presents  4–8  h  after  exposure  with  fever,  chills,  malaise,  cough, 
and dyspnea without wheezing. The history of exposure is obviously 
essential to distinguish this disease from influenza or pneumonia with 
similar  symptoms.  In  the  chronic  form  of  the  disease,  the  history  of 
repeated attacks after similar exposure is important in differentiating 
this syndrome from other causes of patchy fibrosis (e.g., sarcoidosis).
A wide variety of other organic dusts are associated with the occur-
rence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Chap. 288). For patients who 
present with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, specific and careful inquiry 
about occupations, hobbies, and other home environmental exposures 
is necessary to uncover the source of the etiologic agent.

 ■ TOXIC CHEMICALS
Exposure to toxic chemicals affecting the lung generally involves gases 
and vapors. A common accident is one in which the victim is trapped 
in a confined space where the chemicals have accumulated to harmful 
levels. In addition to the specific toxic effects of the chemical, the vic-
tim often sustains considerable anoxia, which can play a dominant role 
in determining whether the individual survives.

Table  289-2  lists  a  variety  of  toxic  agents  that  can  produce  acute 
and sometimes life-threatening reactions in the lung. All these agents 
in sufficient concentrations have been demonstrated, at least in animal 
studies,  to  affect  the  lower  airways  and  disrupt  alveolar  architecture, 
either acutely or as a result of chronic exposure.

Firefighters  and  fire  victims  are  at  risk  of  smoke  inhalation,  an 
important  cause  of  acute  cardiorespiratory  failure.  Smoke  inhalation 
kills  more  fire  victims  than  does  thermal  injury.  Carbon  monoxide 
poisoning with resulting significant hypoxemia can be life-threatening  
(Chap.  459).  Synthetic  materials  (plastic,  polyurethanes),  when 
burned, may release a variety of other toxic agents (such as cyanide and 
hydrochloric acid), and this must be considered in evaluating smoke 
inhalation  victims.  Exposed  victims  may  have  some  degree  of  lower 
respiratory tract inflammation and/or pulmonary edema.

Exposure  to  certain  highly  reactive,  low-molecular-weight  agents 
used  in  the  manufacture  of  synthetic  polymers,  paints,  and  coatings 
(diisocyanates in polyurethanes, aromatic amines and acid anhydrides 
in  epoxies)  is  associated  with  a  high  risk  of  occupational  asthma. 
Although this occupational asthma manifests clinically as if sensitiza-
tion has occurred, an IgE antibody–mediated mechanism is not neces-
sarily involved. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis–like reactions also have 
been described in diisocyanate and acid anhydride–exposed workers.

Fluoropolymers  such  as  Teflon,  which  at  normal  temperatures 
produce  no  reaction,  become  volatilized  upon  heating.  The  inhaled 
agents  cause  a  characteristic  syndrome  of  fever,  chills,  malaise,  and 
occasionally mild wheezing, leading to the diagnosis of polymer fume 
fever.  A  similar  self-limited,  influenza-like  syndrome—metal  fume 
fever—results  from  acute  exposure  to  fumes  containing  zinc  oxide, 
typically  from  welding  of  galvanized  steel.  These  inhalational  fever 
syndromes  may  begin  several  hours  after  work  and  resolve  within  
24 h, only to return on repeated exposure.

Two other agents have been associated with potentially severe lung 
disease.  Occupational  exposure  to  nylon  flock  has  been  shown  to 
induce a lymphocytic bronchiolitis, and workers exposed to diacetyl, 
which is used to provide “butter” flavor in the manufacture of micro-
wave popcorn and other foods, have developed bronchiolitis obliterans 
(Chap. 293).

World  Trade  Center  Disaster  A  consequence  of  the  attack  on 
the World Trade Center (WTC) on September 11, 2001, was relatively 
heavy  exposure  of  a  large  number  of  firefighters  and  other  rescue 
workers to the dust generated by the collapse of the buildings. Envi-
ronmental  monitoring  and  chemical  characterization  of  WTC  dust 
have revealed a wide variety of potentially toxic constituents, although 
much of the dust was pulverized cement. Possibly because of the high 
alkalinity  of  WTC  dust,  significant  cough,  wheeze,  and  phlegm  pro-
duction  occurred  among  firefighters  and  cleanup  crews.  New  cough 
and wheeze syndromes also occurred among local residents. Heavier 
exposure to WTC dust among New York City firefighters was associ-
ated with accelerated decline of lung function over the first year after 
the  disaster.  More  recently,  concerns  have  been  raised  about  risk  of 
interstitial lung disease, especially of a granulomatous nature.

 ■ OCCUPATIONAL RESPIRATORY CARCINOGENS
Exposures at work have been estimated to contribute to 10% of all lung 
cancer  cases.  In  addition  to  asbestos,  other  agents  either  proven  or 
suspected  to  be  respiratory  carcinogens  include  acrylonitrile,  arsenic

2172 compounds,  beryllium,  bis(chloromethyl)  ether,  chromium  (hexava-
lent), formaldehyde (nasal), isopropanol (nasal sinuses), mustard gas, 
nickel  carbonyl  (nickel  smelting),  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons 
(coke oven emissions and diesel exhaust), secondhand tobacco smoke, 
silica  (both  mining  and  processing),  talc  (possible  asbestos  contami-
nation in both mining and milling), vinyl chloride (sarcomas), wood 
(nasal), and uranium. Workers at risk of radiation-related lung cancer 
include not only those involved in mining or processing uranium but 
also  those  exposed  in  underground  mining  operations  of  other  ores 
where radon daughters may be emitted from rock formations.

 ■ ASSESSMENT OF DISABILITY
Disability is the term used to describe the decreased ability to work due 
to the effects of a medical condition. Physicians are generally able to 
assess physiologic dysfunction, or impairment, but the rating of disabil-
ity for compensation of loss of income also involves nonmedical factors 
such as the education and employability of the individual. The disabil-
ity rating scheme differs with the compensation-granting agency. For 
example, the U.S. Social Security Administration requires that an indi-
vidual be unable to do any work (i.e., total disability) before he or she 
will receive income replacement payments. Many state workers’ com-
pensation systems allow for payments for partial disability. In the Social 
Security  scheme,  no  determination  of  cause  is  done,  whereas  work- 
relatedness must be established in workers’ compensation systems.

For respiratory impairment rating, resting pulmonary function tests 
(spirometry  and  diffusing  capacity)  are  used  as  the  initial  assessment 
tool, with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (to assess maximal oxygen 
consumption)  used  if  the  results  of  the  resting  tests  do  not  correlate 
with the patient’s symptoms. Methacholine challenge (to assess airway 
reactivity) can also be useful in patients with asthma who have normal 
spirometry when evaluated. Some compensation agencies (e.g., Social 
Security)  have  proscribed  disability  classification  schemes  based  on 
pulmonary function test results. When no specific scheme is proscribed, 
the Guidelines of the American Medical Association should be used.

GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES
 ■ OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION
Primary  standards  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Agency (EPA) designed to protect the public health with an adequate 
margin of safety exist for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (PM), nitro-
gen  dioxide,  ozone,  lead,  and  carbon  monoxide.  Standards  for  each 
of these pollutants are updated regularly through an extensive review 
process conducted by the EPA. (For details on current standards, go to 
https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table).

Pollutants are generated from both stationary sources (power plants 
and  industrial  facilities)  and  mobile  sources  (motor  vehicles),  and 
none  of  the  regulated  pollutants  occurs  in  isolation.  Furthermore, 
pollutants may be changed by chemical reactions after being emitted. 
For example, sulfur dioxide and PM emissions from a coal-fired power 
plant may react in air to produce acid sulfate aerosols, which can be 
transported long distances in the atmosphere. Oxides of nitrogen and 
volatile organic compounds from automobile exhaust react with sun-
light to produce ozone. Although originally recognized in Los Angeles, 
photochemically  derived  pollution  (“smog”)  is  now  known  to  be  a 
problem  throughout  the  United  States  and  in  many  other  countries. 
Both acute and chronic effects of pollutant exposures have been docu-
mented in large population studies.

The  symptoms  and  diseases  associated  with  air  pollution  are  the 
same  as  conditions  commonly  associated  with  cigarette  smoking.  In 
addition,  decreased  growth  of  lung  function  and  asthma  have  been 
associated  with  chronic  exposure  to  only  modestly  elevated  levels  of 
traffic-related  air  pollution.  Multiple  population-based  time-series 
studies within cities have demonstrated excess health care utilization 
for asthma and other cardiopulmonary conditions as well as increased 
mortality  rates.  Cohort  studies  comparing  cities  that  have  relatively 
high  levels  of  particulate  exposures  with  less  polluted  communities 
suggest  excess  morbidity  and  mortality  rates  from  cardiopulmo-
nary  conditions  in  long-term  residents  of  the  former.  The  strong 

epidemiologic evidence that fine PM is a risk factor for cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality has prompted toxicologic investigations into 
the underlying mechanisms. The inhalation of fine particles from com-
bustion sources generates oxidative stress followed by local injury and 
inflammation in the lungs that in turn lead to autonomic and systemic 
inflammatory responses. Recent research findings on the health effects 
of air pollutants have led to stricter U.S. ambient air quality standards 
for ozone, oxides of nitrogen, and PM as well as greater emphasis on 
publicizing  pollution  alerts  to  encourage  individuals  with  cardiovas-
cular and respiratory disorders to stay indoors during high-pollution 
episodes (e.g., from wildfires).

 ■ INDOOR EXPOSURES
Secondhand tobacco smoke (Chap. 454), radon gas, wood smoke, and 
other  biologic  agents  generated  indoors  must  be  considered.  Several 
studies have shown that the respirable particulate load in any house-
hold is directly proportional to the number of cigarette smokers living 
in that home. Increases in prevalence of respiratory illnesses, especially 
asthma,  and  reduced  levels  of  pulmonary  function  have  been  found 
in  the  children  of  smoking  parents  in  a  number  of  studies.  Recent 
meta-analyses  for  lung  cancer  and  cardiopulmonary  diseases,  com-
bining data from multiple secondhand tobacco smoke epidemiologic 
studies,  suggest  an  ~25%  increase  in  relative  risk  for  each  condition, 
even after adjustment for major potential confounders.

Exposure to radon gas in homes is a risk factor for lung cancer. The 
main radon product (radon-222) is a gas that results from the decay series 
of uranium-238, with the immediate precursor being radium-226. The 
amount of radium in earth materials determines how much radon gas 
will be emitted. Levels associated with excess lung cancer risk may be 
present in as many as 10% of the houses in the United States. When 
smokers reside in the home, the problem is potentially greater, because 
the molecular size of radon particles allows them to attach readily to 
smoke particles that are inhaled. Fortunately, technology is available for 
assessing and reducing the level of exposure.

Other  indoor  exposures  of  concern  are  bioaerosols  that  contain 
antigenic  material  (fungi,  cockroaches,  dust  mites,  and  pet  danders) 
associated with an increased risk of atopy and asthma. Indoor chemical 
agents  include  strong  cleaning  agents  (bleach,  ammonia),  formalde-
hyde, perfumes, pesticides, and oxides of nitrogen from gas appliances. 
Nonspecific responses associated with “tight-building syndrome,” per-
haps better termed “building-associated illness,” in which no particular 
agent has been implicated, have included a wide variety of complaints, 
among them respiratory symptoms that are relieved only by avoiding 
exposure  in  the  building  in  question.  The  degree  to  which  “smells” 
and other sensory stimuli are involved in the triggering of potentially 
incapacitating psychological or physical responses has yet to be deter-
mined, and the long-term consequences of such environmental expo-
sures are unknown.

Indoor exposure to household air pollution from cooking or heating 
with solid fuels (wood, dung, crop residues, charcoal, coal) is estimated 
to be responsible for ~2.7% of worldwide disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs)  lost,  due  to  acute  lower  respiratory  infections  in  children, 
COPD and lung cancer in women, and cardiovascular disease among 
men. This burden of disease places exposure to household air pollution 
as one of the leading environmental hazards for poor health on a global 
scale.

Forty percent of the world’s population uses solid fuel for cooking, 
heating, or baking. Kerosene (similar to diesel fuel) is often used for 
lighting  and  sometimes  cooking.  This  occurs  predominantly  in  the 
rural areas of developing countries. Because many families burn coal 
or biomass fuels in open stoves, which are highly inefficient, and inside 
homes with poor ventilation, women and young children are exposed 
on  a  daily  basis  to  high  levels  of  smoke.  In  these  homes,  24-h  mean 
levels of fine PM have been reported to be 2–30 times higher than the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standard set by the U.S. EPA.

Epidemiologic studies have consistently shown associations between 
exposure  to  biomass  smoke  and  both  chronic  bronchitis  and  COPD. 
Because of increased migration to the United States from developing 
countries, clinicians need to be aware of the chronic respiratory effects

disease (Fig. 289-4). Evidence is beginning to emerge that improved 
stoves that reduce biomass smoke exposure can reduce risk of respira-
tory illness in both children and adults.

also  contributes  substantially  to  outdoor  air  pollution.  Contributions 
from  HAP,  coal-fired  power  plants  without  emission  scrubbers,  and

tion controls can lead to high concentrations of outdoor air pollution,

290 Bronchiectasis

Rebecca M. Baron, Beverly W. Baron,  
Miriam Baron Barshak

Bronchiectasis refers to an irreversible airway dilation that involves the 
lung in either a focal or a diffuse manner and that classically has been 
categorized  as  cylindrical  or  tubular  (the  most  common  form),  vari-
cose,  or  cystic.  This  chapter  will  focus  largely  on  non–cystic  fibrosis 
(CF) bronchiectasis. The reader is referred to Chapter 291 for a more 
focused discussion on CF bronchiectasis.

 ■ ETIOLOGY
Bronchiectasis  can  arise  from  infectious  or  noninfectious  causes  
(Table  290-1).  Clues  to  the  underlying  etiology  often  are  provided 
by  the  pattern  of  lung  involvement.  Focal  bronchiectasis  refers  to 
bronchiectatic  changes  in  a  localized  area  of  the  lung  and  can  be  a 
consequence  of  obstruction  of  the  airway—either  extrinsic  (e.g.,  due 
to compression by adjacent lymphadenopathy or parenchymal tumor 
mass)  or  intrinsic  (e.g.,  due  to  an  airway  tumor  or  aspirated  foreign 
body,  a  scarred/stenotic  airway,  or  bronchial  atresia  from  congenital 
underdevelopment  of  the  airway).  Diffuse  bronchiectasis  is  character-
ized  by  widespread  bronchiectatic  changes  throughout  the  lung  and 
often arises from an underlying systemic or infectious disease process.
More  pronounced  involvement  of  the  upper  lung  fields  is  most 
common  in  CF  and  also  is  observed  in  postradiation  fibrosis,  cor-
responding  to  the  lung  region  encompassed  by  the  radiation  port. 
Bronchiectasis with predominant involvement of the lower lung fields 
usually  has  its  source  in  chronic  recurrent  aspiration  (e.g.,  due  to 
esophageal  motility  disorders  like  those  in  scleroderma),  end-stage 
fibrotic  lung  disease  (e.g.,  traction  bronchiectasis  from  idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis), or recurrent immunodeficiency-associated infec-
tions  (e.g.,  hypogammaglobulinemia).  Bronchiectasis  resulting  from 
infection  by  nontuberculous  mycobacteria  (NTM),  most  commonly 
the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC), often prefer-
entially affects the midlung fields. Congenital causes of bronchiectasis 
with  predominant  midlung  field  involvement  include  the  dyskinetic/
immotile  cilia  syndrome.  Finally,  predominant  involvement  of  the 
central airways is reported in association with allergic bronchopulmo-
nary aspergillosis (ABPA), in which an immune-mediated reaction to 
Aspergillus  damages  the  bronchial  wall.  Congenital  causes  of  central 
airway–predominant  bronchiectasis  resulting  from  cartilage  defi-
ciency include tracheobronchomegaly (Mounier-Kuhn syndrome) and  
Williams-Campbell syndrome.

In many cases, the etiology of bronchiectasis is not determined. In 
case series, as many as 25–50% of patients referred for bronchiectasis 
have idiopathic disease.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
The overall reported prevalence of bronchiectasis in the United States 
has  recently  increased,  but  the  epidemiology  of  bronchiectasis  varies 
greatly with the underlying etiology. For example, patients born with 
CF often develop significant clinical bronchiectasis in late adolescence 
or early adulthood, although atypical presentations of CF in adults in 
their  thirties  and  forties  are  also  possible.  In  contrast,  bronchiectasis 
resulting  from  MAC  infection  classically  affects  nonsmoking  women 
>50 years of age. In general, the incidence of bronchiectasis increases 
with age. Bronchiectasis is more common among women than among 
men. Bronchiectasis may also frequently be co-diagnosed with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.

In  areas  where  tuberculosis  is  prevalent,  bronchiectasis  more 
frequently  occurs  as  a  sequela  of  granulomatous  infection.  Focal 
bronchiectasis can arise from extrinsic compression of the airway by 
enlarged  granulomatous  lymph  nodes  and/or  from  development  of 
intrinsic  obstruction  as  a  result  of  erosion  of  a  calcified  lymph  node 
through  the  airway  wall  (e.g.,  broncholithiasis).  Especially  in  reacti-
vated tuberculosis, parenchymal destruction from infection can result 
in  areas  of  more  diffuse  bronchiectasis.  Apart  from  cases  associated 
with  tuberculosis,  an  increased  incidence  of  non-CF  bronchiectasis 
with an unclear underlying mechanism has been reported as a signifi-
cant problem in developing nations. It has been suggested that the high 
incidence of malnutrition in certain areas may predispose to immune 
dysfunction and development of bronchiectasis.
 ■ PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY
The most widely cited mechanism of infectious bronchiectasis is the 
“vicious cycle hypothesis,” in which susceptibility to infection and poor 
mucociliary clearance result in microbial colonization of the bronchial 
tree. Some organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibit a par-
ticular  propensity  for  colonizing  damaged  airways  and  evading  host 
defense mechanisms. Impaired mucociliary clearance can result from 
inherited conditions such as CF or dyskinetic cilia syndrome, and it has 
been proposed that a single severe infection (e.g., pneumonia caused 
by  Bordetella  pertussis  or  Mycoplasma  pneumoniae)  can  result  in 

significant airway damage and poor secretion clearance. The presence 
of the microbes incites continued chronic inflammation, with conse-
quent damage to the airway wall, continued impairment of secretions 
and  microbial  clearance,  and  ongoing  propagation  of  the  infectious/ 
inflammatory  cycle.  Moreover,  it  has  been  proposed  that  media-
tors  released  directly  from  bacteria  can  interfere  with  mucociliary 
clearance.

Classic  studies  of  the  pathology  of  bronchiectasis  from  the  1950s 
demonstrated  significant  small-airway  wall 
inflammation  and 
larger-airway wall destruction as well as dilation, with loss of elastin, 
smooth muscle, and cartilage. It has been proposed that inflammatory 
cells in the small airways release proteases and other mediators, such as 
reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, that damage 
the larger airway walls. Furthermore, the ongoing inflammatory pro-
cess in the smaller airways results in airflow obstruction. It is thought 
that antiproteases, such as α1 antitrypsin, play an important role in neu-
tralizing the damaging effects of neutrophil elastase and in enhancing 
bacterial killing. Bronchiectasis and emphysema have been observed in 
patients with α1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Proposed  mechanisms  for  noninfectious  bronchiectasis  include 
immune-mediated reactions that damage the bronchial wall (e.g., those 
associated with systemic autoimmune conditions such as Sjögren’s syn-
drome and rheumatoid arthritis). Recent studies suggest that there might 
exist a new bronchiectasis endophenotype of patients with sensitization 
to  multiple  environmental  allergens.  Traction  bronchiectasis  refers  to 
dilated airways arising from parenchymal distortion as a result of lung 
fibrosis (e.g., postradiation fibrosis or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The most common clinical presentation is a persistent productive cough 
with ongoing production of thick, tenacious sputum. Physical findings 
frequently  include  crackles  and  wheezing  on  lung  auscultation,  and 
some patients with bronchiectasis exhibit clubbing of the digits. Mild to 
moderate airflow obstruction often is detected on pulmonary function 
tests, overlapping with that seen at presentation with other conditions, 
such  as  COPD.  Acute  exacerbations  of  bronchiectasis  usually  are 
characterized  by  changes  in  the  nature  of  sputum  production,  with 
increased volume and purulence. However, typical signs and symptoms 
of lung infection, such as fever and new infiltrates, may not be present.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The  diagnosis  usually  is  based  on  presentation  with  a  persistent 
chronic  cough  and  sputum  production  accompanied  by  consistent 
radiographic features. Although chest radiographs lack sensitivity, the 
presence of “tram tracks” indicating dilated airways is consistent with 
bronchiectasis. Chest CT is more specific for bronchiectasis and is the 
imaging modality of choice for confirming the diagnosis. CT findings 
include  airway  dilation  (detected  as  parallel  “tram  tracks”  or  as  the 
“signet-ring sign”—a cross-sectional area of the airway with a diameter 
at least 1.5 times that of the adjacent vessel), lack of bronchial tapering 
(including  the  presence  of  tubular  structures  within  1  cm  from  the 
pleural  surface),  bronchial  wall  thickening  in  dilated  airways,  inspis-
sated  secretions  (e.g.,  the  “tree-in-bud”  pattern),  or  cysts  emanating 
from the bronchial wall (especially pronounced in cystic bronchiecta-
sis) (Fig. 290-1).

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Bronchiectasis

The  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  bronchiectasis  entails  elicitation 
of  a  clinical  history,  chest  imaging,  and  a  workup  to  determine 
the  underlying  etiology.  Evaluation  of  focal  bronchiectasis  almost 
always requires bronchoscopy to exclude airway obstruction by an 
underlying mass or foreign body. A workup for diffuse bronchiec-
tasis includes analysis for the major etiologies (Table 290-1), with 
an initial focus on excluding CF. Pulmonary function testing is an 
important component of a functional assessment of the patient.

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THERAPY
It  has  been  proposed  that  control  of  the  inflammatory  response 
may be of benefit in bronchiectasis, and relatively small-scale trials 
have  yielded  evidence  of  alleviated  dyspnea,  decreased  need  for 
inhaled  β-agonists,  and  reduced  sputum  production  with  inhaled 
glucocorticoids. However, no significant differences in lung func-
tion or bronchiectasis exacerbation rates have been observed. Risks 
of immunosuppression and adrenal suppression must be carefully 
considered  with  use  of  anti-inflammatory  therapy  in  infectious 
bronchiectasis. Nevertheless, administration of oral/systemic gluco-
corticoids may be important in treatment of bronchiectasis due to 
certain etiologies, such as ABPA, or of noninfectious bronchiectasis 
due to underlying conditions, especially that in which an autoim-
mune condition is believed to be active (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis 
or Sjögren’s syndrome). Patients with ABPA also may benefit from 
a  prolonged  course  of  treatment  with  the  oral  antifungal  agent 
itraconazole. 
REFRACTORY CASES
In select cases, surgery can be considered, with resection of a focal 
area of suppuration. In advanced cases, lung transplantation can be 
considered.

TREATMENT
Bronchiectasis

Treatment of infectious bronchiectasis is directed at the control of 
active infection and improvements in secretion clearance and bron-
chial hygiene so as to decrease the microbial load within the airways 
and minimize the risk of repeated infections. 
ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT
Antibiotics targeting the causative or presumptive pathogen (with 
Haemophilus  influenzae  and  P.  aeruginosa  isolated  commonly) 
should be administered in acute exacerbations, usually for a min-
imum of 7–10 days and perhaps for as long as 14 days. Decisions 
about treatment of NTM infection can be difficult, given that these 
organisms can be colonizers as well as pathogens and the prolonged 
treatment course often is not well tolerated. Consensus guidelines 
have  advised  that  diagnostic  criteria  for  true  clinical  infection 
with  NTM  should  be  considered  in  patients  with  symptoms  and 
radiographic findings of lung disease who have at least two sputum 
samples  positive  on  culture;  at  least  one  bronchoalveolar  lavage 
(BAL) fluid sample positive on culture; a biopsy sample displaying 
histopathologic  features  of  NTM  infection  (e.g.,  granuloma  or  a 
positive stain for acid-fast bacilli) along with one positive sputum 
culture; or a pleural fluid sample (or a sample from another ster-
ile  extrapulmonary  site)  positive  on  culture.  MAC  strains  are  the 
most  common  NTM  pathogens,  and  the  recommended  regimen 
for  HIV-negative  patients  infected  with  macrolide-sensitive  MAC 
includes  a  macrolide  combined  with  rifampin  and  ethambutol. 
Consensus guidelines recommend macrolide susceptibility testing 
for clinically significant MAC isolates. 
BRONCHIAL HYGIENE
The numerous approaches used to enhance secretion clearance in 
bronchiectasis  include  hydration  and  mucolytic  administration, 
aerosolization  of  bronchodilators  and  hyperosmolar  agents  (e.g., 
hypertonic saline), and chest physiotherapy (e.g., postural drainage, 
traditional  mechanical  chest  percussion  via  hand  clapping  to  the 
chest,  or  use  of  devices  such  as  an  oscillatory  positive  expiratory 
pressure  flutter  valve  or  a  high-frequency  chest  wall  oscillation 
vest).  Pulmonary  rehabilitation  and  a  regular  exercise  program 
may assist with secretion clearance as well as with other aspects of 
bronchiectasis, including improved exercise capacity and quality of 
life. The mucolytic dornase (DNase) is recommended routinely in 
CF-related bronchiectasis but not in non-CF bronchiectasis, given 
concerns about lack of efficacy and potential harm in the non-CF 
population. 

 ■ COMPLICATIONS
In more severe cases of infectious bronchiectasis, recurrent infections 
and repeated courses of antibiotics can lead to microbial resistance to 
antibiotics. In certain cases, combinations of antibiotics that have inde-
pendent toxicity profiles may be necessary to treat resistant organisms.
Recurrent  infections  can  result  in  injury  to  superficial  mucosal 
vessels, with bleeding and, in severe cases, life-threatening hemoptysis. 
Management  of  massive  hemoptysis  usually  requires  intubation  to 
stabilize the patient, identification of the source of bleeding, and pro-
tection of the nonbleeding lung. Control of bleeding often necessitates 
bronchial artery embolization and, in severe cases, surgery.
 ■ PROGNOSIS
Outcomes  of  bronchiectasis  can  vary  widely  with  the  underlying 
etiology  and  comorbid  conditions  and  also  may  be  influenced  by 
the  frequency  of  exacerbations  and  (in  infectious  cases)  the  specific 
pathogens involved (with worse outcomes associated with P. aeruginosa 
colonization).  Increasing  attention  is  being  given  to  defining  clinical 
subphenotypes  of  bronchiectasis  in  light  of  heterogeneous  clinical, 
radiographic, and microbial features and to developing screening tools 
for the assessment of quality of life and disease severity. In one study, 
the  decline  of  lung  function  in  patients  with  non-CF  bronchiectasis 
was similar to that in patients with COPD, with the forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s (FEV1) declining by 50–55 mL per year as opposed to 
20–30 mL per year for healthy controls.
 ■ PREVENTION
Reversal of an underlying immunodeficient state (e.g., by administra-
tion  of  gamma  globulin  for  immunoglobulin-deficient  patients)  and 
vaccination of patients with chronic respiratory conditions (e.g., influ-
enza  and  pneumococcal  vaccines)  can  decrease  the  risk  of  recurrent 
infections.  Patients  who  smoke  should  be  counseled  about  smoking 
cessation.

After resolution of an acute infection in patients with recurrences 
(e.g., ≥3 episodes per year), the use of suppressive antibiotics to mini-
mize the microbial load and reduce the frequency of exacerbations has 
been proposed. Although there is less consensus about this approach 
in non-CF-associated bronchiectasis than in CF-related bronchiectasis, 
small  studies  have  supported  benefits  of  selected  therapies.  Possible 
suppressive  treatments  include  (1)  administration  of  an  oral  antibi-
otic  (e.g.,  ciprofloxacin)  daily  for  1–2  weeks  per  month;  (2)  use  of  a 
rotating  schedule  of  oral  antibiotics  (to  minimize  the  risk  of  devel-
opment  of  drug  resistance);  (3)  administration  of  a  macrolide  anti-
biotic (see below) daily or three times per week (with mechanisms of 
possible benefit related to non-antimicrobial properties, such as anti- 
inflammatory  effects  and  reduction  of  gram-negative  bacillary 

HPIM21e_Part7_p2131-p2216.indd   2175

biofilms);  (4)  inhalation  of  aerosolized  antibiotics  (e.g.,  tobramycin 
inhalation  solution)  for  select  patients  on  a  rotating  schedule  (e.g., 
30  days  on,  30  days  off),  with  the  goal  of  decreasing  the  microbial 
load without eliciting the side effects of systemic drug administration; 
other studies examining inhaled aztreonam and inhaled ciprofloxacin 
formulations  have  shown  conflicting  results,  suggesting  there  might 
be  subpopulations  of  patients  with  bronchiectasis  who  might  benefit 
from specific therapies; and (5) intermittent administration of IV anti-
biotics (e.g., “clean-outs”) for patients with more severe bronchiectasis 
and/or resistant pathogens. In relation to macrolide therapy (point 3 
above),  a  number  of  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  randomized 
trials  have  been  published  in  non-CF  bronchiectasis  and  support  a 
benefit of long-term macrolides (6–12 months of azithromycin or ery-
thromycin) in decreasing rates of bronchiectasis exacerbation, mucus 
production, and decline in lung function. However, two of these studies 
and  a  meta-analysis  also  reported  increased  macrolide  resistance  in 
commensal  pathogens,  dampening  enthusiasm  for  universal  use  of 
macrolides  in  this  setting  and  raising  the  question  of  whether  there 
might be select non-CF bronchiectasis patients with higher morbidity 
for whom benefits of long-term macrolides might outweigh the risks 
of  emergence  of  antibiotic  resistance.  In  particular,  development  of 
macrolide-resistant NTM is a potential concern, making treatment of 
those pathogens much more difficult. Furthermore, patients with dif-
ferent patterns of microbial colonization may not all experience similar 
benefits with macrolide therapy. Therefore, before chronic macrolide 
therapy  is  considered,  it  is  advisable  to  rule  out  NTM  infection  and 
carefully consider each patient’s scenario closely, obtaining an electro-
cardiogram to rule out a prolonged QT interval that might place the 
patient at increased risk of arrhythmias.

In addition, ongoing consistent attention to bronchial hygiene can 
promote  secretion  clearance  and  decrease  the  microbial  load  in  the 
airways.

291 Cystic Fibrosis

Eric J. Sorscher

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive exocrinopathy affecting 
multiple  epithelial  tissues.  The  gene  product  responsible  for  CF  (the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR]) serves 
as an anion channel in the apical (luminal) plasma membranes of epi-
thelial cells and regulates volume and composition of exocrine secre-
tion. An increasingly sophisticated understanding of CFTR molecular 
genetics and membrane protein biochemistry has facilitated CF drug 
discovery, with a number of recently approved agents that have trans-
formed the clinical outlook for many with the disease.

Respiratory  Manifestations  The  major  morbidity  and  mor-
tality  associated  with  CF  is  attributable  to  pulmonary  compromise, 

characterized  by  copious  hyperviscous  and  adherent  secretions  that 
obstruct  small  and  medium-sized  airways.  CF  respiratory  secretions 
are  exceedingly  difficult  to  clear,  and  a  complex  bacterial  flora  that 
includes  Staphylococcus  aureus,  Haemophilus  influenzae,  and  Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa (among other pathogens, see below) is routinely 
cultured from CF sputum. Microbiome analysis has identified dozens 
of other bacterial species in CF lungs, although a relationship of these 
less well-characterized organisms to disease progression has not been 
determined. Robust pulmonary inflammation in the setting of inspis-
sated  mucus  and  chronic  bacterial  infection  leads  to  collateral  tissue 
injury and further aggravates respiratory decline. Organisms such as P. 
aeruginosa exhibit a stereotypic mode of pathogenesis; a sentinel and 
early colonization event often engenders lifelong pulmonary infection 
by the same genetic strain. Over a period of many years, P. aeruginosa 
evolves  in  CF  lungs  to  adopt  a  mucoid  phenotype  (attributable  to 
release of alginate exoproduct) that confers selective advantage for the 
pathogen and poor prognosis for the host.

Pancreatic  Findings  The  complete  name  of  the  disease,  cystic 
fibrosis  of  the  pancreas,  refers  to  profound  tissue  destruction  of  the 
exocrine  pancreas,  with  fibrotic  scarring  and/or  fatty  replacement, 
cyst formation, loss of acinar tissue, and ablation of normal pancreatic 
architecture. As in the lung, tenacious exocrine secretions (sometimes 
termed  concretions)  obstruct  pancreatic  ducts  and  impair  production 
and flow of digestive enzymes to the duodenum. The sequelae of exo-
crine  pancreatic  insufficiency  include  chronic  malabsorption,  poor 
growth,  fat-soluble  vitamin  insufficiency,  high  levels  of  blood  immu-
noreactive trypsinogen (a test used in newborn screening), and loss of 
pancreatic islet cell mass. CF-related diabetes mellitus is a manifestation 
in >30% of adults with the disease and likely multifactorial in nature 
(attributable  to  progressive  destruction/dysfunction  of  the  endocrine 
pancreas and, in some cases, insulin resistance or other features).

Additional Organ System Damage  As in CF lung and pancreas, 
thick  and  inspissated  secretions  compromise  numerous  exocrine  tis-
sues. Obstruction of intrahepatic bile ducts and parenchymal fibrosis 
are  commonly  observed  in  pathologic  specimens,  with  multilobular 
cirrhosis in 4–15% of patients with CF and significant hepatic insuf-
ficiency as a resulting manifestation among many adults. Contents of 
the intestinal lumen are often difficult to excrete, leading to meconium 
ileus (a presentation in 10–20% of newborns with CF) or distal intes-
tinal obstructive syndrome in older individuals. Men typically exhibit 
complete  involution  of  the  vas  deferens  and  infertility  (despite  func-
tioning spermatogenesis), and ~99% of males with CF are infertile. The 
etiology of this dramatic anatomic defect in the male genitourinary sys-
tem is not understood but may represent a developmental abnormality 
secondary  to  improper  epithelial  secretion  in  the  vas  or  associated 
structures. Males with CF can conceive children through in vitro fertil-
ization. Abnormalities of female reproductive tract secretions are likely 
contributors  to  a  higher  incidence  of  infertility  among  women  with 
the disease. Radiographic evidence of sinusitis occurs in most patients 
with  CF  and  is  associated  with  organisms  similar  to  those  recovered 
from lower airways, suggesting the sinus may serve as a reservoir for 
bacterial seeding.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS
Cystic  Fibrosis  Transmembrane  Conductance  Regulator  
CFTR is an integral membrane protein that functions as an epithelial 
anion  channel.  The  ~1480-amino-acid  molecule  encodes  a  passive 
conduit  for  chloride  and  bicarbonate  transport  across  plasma  mem-
branes of epithelial tissues, with direction of ion flow dependent on the 
electrochemical driving force. Gating of CFTR involves conformational 
cycling between an open and closed configuration and is augmented by 
hydrolysis  of  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP).  Anion  flux  mediated  by 
CFTR does not involve active transport against a concentration gradi-
ent but utilizes the energy provided from ATP hydrolysis as a central 
feature of ion channel mechanochemistry and gating.

CFTR  is  situated  in  the  apical  plasma  membranes  of  acinar  and 
other  epithelial  cells  where  it  regulates  the  amount  and  composition

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemof  secretion  by  exocrine  glands.  In  numerous  epithelia,  chloride  and 
bicarbonate  release  via  CFTR  is  followed  passively  by  flow  of  water 
through other pathways, aiding mobilization and clearance of exocrine 
products.  Along  respiratory  mucosa,  CFTR  is  necessary  to  provide 
sufficient  depth  of  the  periciliary  fluid  layer  (PCL),  allowing  normal 
ciliary  extension  and  mucociliary  transport.  CFTR-deficient  airway 
cells exhibit depleted PCL, causing ciliary collapse and failure to clear 
overlying mucus (Video 291-1). In airway submucosal glands, CFTR 
is  expressed  in  acini  and  may  participate  both  in  the  formation  of 
mucus  and  extrusion  of  glandular  secretion  onto  the  airway  surface  
(Fig.  291-1).  In  other  exocrine  glands  characterized  by  abrogated 
mucus transport (e.g., pancreatic acini and ducts, as well as bile cana-
liculi, and intestinal secretions), similar pathogenic mechanisms have 
been  implicated.  In  these  tissues,  a  driving  force  for  apical  chloride 
and/or  bicarbonate  secretion  is  believed  to  promote  CFTR-mediated 
fluid  and  electrolyte  release  into  the  lumen,  which  confers  proper 
rheology of mucins and other exocrine products. Failure of this mech-
anism disrupts normal hydration and transport of glandular secretion 
and  is  widely  viewed  as  a  proximate  cause  of  obstruction,  with  con-
comitant tissue injury.

Pulmonary Inflammation and Remodeling  The CF airway is 
characterized  by  an  aggressive,  unrelenting,  neutrophilic  inflamma-
tory response with release of proteases and oxidants leading to airway 
remodeling  and  bronchiectasis.  Intense  pulmonary  inflammation  is 
largely driven by chronic respiratory infection. Macrophages and other 
cells  resident  in  CF  lungs  augment  elaboration  of  proinflammatory 
cytokines, which contribute to innate and adaptive immune reactivity. 
CFTR-dependent  abnormalities  of  airway  surface  fluid  composition 
(e.g., pH) have been reported as contributors to impaired bacterial kill-
ing in CF lungs. The role of CFTR as a direct mediator of inflammatory 
responsiveness and/or pulmonary remodeling represents an important 
and topical area of investigation.

 ■ MOLECULAR GENETICS
DNA sequencing of CFTR from patients (and others) worldwide has 
revealed >1600 allelic mutations; several hundred of these have been 
well  characterized  as  disease-causing  variants.  Distinguishing  the 
single  nucleotide  transversions  or  other  polymorphisms  with  causal 
relevance can sometimes present a significant challenge. The CFTR2 
resource  (www.cftr2.org/)  helps  delineate  gene  variants  with  a  clear 
etiologic role.

CFTR defects known to elicit disease are often categorized based on 
molecular  mechanism.  For  example,  the  common  F508del  mutation 
(nomenclature  denotes  omission  of  a  single  phenylalanine  residue 
[F]  at  CFTR  position  508)  leads  to  a  folding  abnormality  recognized 
by  cellular  quality  control  pathways.  CFTR  encoding  F508del  retains 
partial ion channel function, but protein maturation is arrested in the 
endoplasmic  reticulum,  and  CFTR  fails  to  arrive  at  the  plasma  mem-
brane. Instead, F508del CFTR is misrouted and undergoes endoplasmic  
reticulum–associated degradation via the proteasome. CFTR mutations 
that disrupt protein maturation are termed class II defects and are by 
far the most common genetic abnormalities. F508del alone accounts for 
~70% of defective CFTR alleles in the United States, where ~90% of indi-
viduals with CF carry at least one F508del mutation. (See Video 291-1).
Other  gene  defects  include  CFTR  ion  channels  properly  trafficked 
to the apical cell surface but unable to open and/or gate. Such channel 
proteins include G551D (a glycine to aspartic acid replacement at CFTR 
position 551), which leads to an inability to transport Cl– or HCO3
– (a 
class III abnormality). Individuals with at least one G551D allele rep-
resent  ~4%  of  patients  with  CF.  CFTR  nonsense  mutations  such  as 
G542X, R553X, or W1282X (premature termination codon replaces gly-
cine, arginine, or tryptophan at positions 542, 553, or 1282, respectively) 
are among the common class I defects, in addition to large deletions or 
other major disruptions of the gene. The W1282X mutation, for exam-
ple, is prevalent among individuals of Ashkenazi descent and a predom-
inant  CF  genotype  in  Israel.  Additional  categories  of  CFTR  mutation 
include defects in the ion channel pore (class IV), RNA splicing (class 
V), and increased plasma membrane turnover (class VI) (Fig. 291-2).

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
During  the  past  decade,  newborn  screening  has  led  to  most  CF 
diagnoses,  with  confirmation  through  CFTR  mutation  analysis 
and  sweat  electrolyte  measurements  as  cardinal  tests.  DNA-based

FIGURE  291-2  Categories  of  CFTR  mutations.  Classes  of  defects  in  the  CFTR 
gene include the absence of synthesis (class I); defective protein maturation and 
premature degradation (class II); disordered gating/regulation, such as diminished 
adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)  binding  and  hydrolysis  (class  III);  defective 
conductance through the ion channel pore (class IV); a reduced number of CFTR 
transcripts  due  to  a  promoter  or  splicing  abnormality  (class  V);  and  accelerated 
turnover from the cell surface (class VI). (From SM Rowe, S Miller, EJ Sorscher:

evaluation  typically  surveys  numerous  disease-associated  mutations; 
panels  that  identify  up  to  ~330  CFTR  variants  are  available  through 
a  variety  of  public  health  laboratories  or  commercial  sources.  For 
difficult  cases,  complete  CFTR  exonic  sequencing  together  with 
analysis  of  splice  junctions  and  key  regulatory  elements  can  be  
obtained.

Sweat  electrolytes  following  pilocarpine  iontophoresis  continue  to 
comprise an essential diagnostic element, with levels of chloride mark-
edly  elevated  in  CF  compared  to  non-CF  individuals.  The  sweat  test 
result is highly specific and served as a mainstay of diagnosis for many 
decades  prior  to  availability  of  CFTR  genotyping.  Notably,  hypervis-
cosity  of  eccrine  sweat  is  not  a  clinical  feature  of  the  disease.  Sweat 
ducts  function  to  reabsorb  chloride  from  a  primary  sweat  secretion 
produced by the glandular coil. Malfunction of CFTR leads to dimin-
ished chloride uptake from the ductular lumen, and sweat emerges on 
the  skin  with  elevated  levels  of  chloride.  For  the  unusual  situation  in 
which both CFTR genotype and sweat electrolytes are inconclusive, in 
vivo measurement of ion transport across the nasal airways can serve 
as a specific test for CF and is used by a number of referral centers. For 
example, elevated (sodium-dependent) transepithelial charge separation 
across  airway  epithelial  tissue  and  persistent  failure  of  isoproterenol- 
dependent chloride secretion (via CFTR) represent bioelectric findings 
specific for the disease. Measurements of CFTR activity in excised rec-
tal mucosal biopsies can also be obtained.

 ■ COMPLEXITY OF A CF PHENOTYPE
Prior  to  the  advent  of  newborn  screening,  CF  classically  presented 
in  childhood  with  chronic  productive  cough,  malabsorption  includ-
ing  steatorrhea,  and  failure  to  thrive.  The  disease  is  most  common 
among  whites  (~1  in  3300  live  births)  and  much  less  frequent  among 
African-American (~1 in 10,000) or Asian populations (~1 in 33,000). 
Several  “severe”  defects  that  impair  CFTR  activity  (including  F508del, 
G551D, and truncation alleles) are predictive of pancreatic insufficiency, 
which is clinically evident in ~90% of individuals with the disease. These 
few  genotype-phenotype  correlations  notwithstanding,  genotype  is,  in 
general, a poor predictor of overall respiratory prognosis.

A  spectrum  of  CFTR-related  conditions  with  features  resembling 
classic CF has been well described. In addition to multiorgan involve-
ment,  forme  frustes,  such  as  isolated  congenital  bilateral  absence  of 
the vas deferens or pancreatitis (without other organ system findings), 
are  strongly  associated  with  CFTR  mutations  in  at  least  one  allele. 
Although  CF  is  a  classic  monogenic  disease,  the  importance  of  non- 
CFTR gene modifiers and proteins that regulate ion flux, inflammatory 
pathways, and airway remodeling has been appreciated as influencing 
clinical course. For example, the magnitude of transepithelial sodium 
reabsorption in CF airways, which helps control periciliary fluid depth 
and  composition,  is  strongly  influenced  by  CFTR  and  represents  a 
molecular target for intervention.

 ■ CFTR MODULATORS
Potentiation of Mutant CFTR Gating  A major effort directed 
toward high-throughput analysis of large compound libraries (including 
millions of individual agents) has identified effective new approaches 
to  CF  therapy.  The  first  approved  compound  in  this  class,  ivacaftor, 
robustly potentiates CFTR channel opening and stimulates ion trans-
port. Ivacaftor overcomes the G551D CFTR gating defect, and individ-
uals carrying this mutation exhibit pronounced improvement in lung 
function, weight gain, and other clinical benefit following oral therapy. 
Sweat chloride values are significantly reduced by the drug. Prior to iva-
caftor, no clinical intervention of any sort had been shown to normalize 
the  CF  sweat  phenotype.  In  addition  to  G551D,  ivacaftor  has  been 
approved  in  the  United  States  for  96  other  CFTR  variants.  Multiyear 
administration studies indicate durable respiratory improvement. Iva-
caftor has been viewed as the harbinger of a new era for CF therapeutics 
directed at treating the most fundamental causes of this disease.

Correction  of  the  F508del  Processing  Abnormality  Lumacaf-
tor  and  tezacaftor,  two  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)–
approved “corrector” molecules that repair CFTR misfolding (as distinct 
from CFTR gating “potentiators” such as ivacaftor), partially overcome 
defective  F508del  CFTR  biogenesis.  The  drugs  promote  cell  surface 
localization of F508del CFTR. Formulations of lumacaftor or tezacaftor 
(together  with  ivacaftor  to  augment  channel  opening)  typically  con-
fer  modest  improvement  in  pulmonary  function  among  individuals 
homozygous for F508del (~45% of the U.S. CF population). Elexacaftor, 
a next-generation corrector that operates through a different mechanism 
of action, is FDA-approved in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
for patients with CF encoding at least one F508del variant (irrespective 
of  the  other  CFTR  mutations),  as  well  as  for  a  series  of  less  common 
CFTR  defects.  This  triple  combination  therapy  (TCT)  may,  therefore, 
benefit >90% of individuals with the disease. Marked enhancement of 
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), fewer respiratory exacerbations, 
improved quality of life, and diminished sweat chloride have all been 
demonstrated  in  patients  following  TCT,  leading  to  designation  as 
“highly effective modulator treatments” (HEMTs). For example, among 
patients carrying one F508del together with a CFTR minimal function 
variant, FEV1 (% predicted) was improved by ~14% over a 4- to 24-week 
treatment period. Monitoring liver function of patients started on TCTs 
and attention to pharmacologic interactions, including effects mediated 
by CYP3A, are required. (See Video 291-2A,B).

Personalized Molecular Therapies  The advent of CFTR mod-
ulators  with  robust  clinical  impact  has  engendered  new  optimism 
regarding  care  of  patients  with  CF.  Based  on  the  large  number  of

disease-causing  CFTR  mutations,  together  with  the  ability  to  group 
these  into  molecular  categories  (Fig.  291-2),  CF  has  been  deemed  a 
condition ideally suited for personalized (i.e., mechanistically tailored) 
drug treatment. That being said, many CFTR variants clearly exhibit 
multiple molecular abnormalities (across more than one mechanistic 
subclass),  and  modulator  compounds  can  therefore  provide  benefit 
across numerous disease subcategories. CFTR drug discovery—while 
highly  successful—might,  therefore,  be  viewed  as  less  “personalized” 
or “precise” than originally envisioned. Moreover, clinical data indicate 
that  a  subset  of  individuals  with  F508del  respond  poorly  to  TCTs. 
Understanding  the  multifactorial  determinants  mediating  favorable 
drug response and risk of toxicity (e.g., genomic loci other than CFTR, 
epigenetic/environmental features, complex CFTR alleles with numer-
ous polymorphisms) constitutes a major objective for future research 
in the field.

Other  Challenges  Involving  CF  Precision  Therapy  The 
high  cost  of  modulator  compounds  has  often  restricted  third-party 
reimbursement to include only the specific genotypes for which FDA 
or  other  regulatory  approval  has  been  obtained.  As  a  consequence, 
modulator access to potentially efficacious agents among patients with 
very rare CFTR defects, and off-label prescribing, are largely precluded. 
Moreover,  clinical  trials  intended  to  expand  the  drug  label  can  be 
difficult  to  arrange  based  on  the  small  numbers  of  patients  carrying 
ultra-rare alleles. In vitro models rigorously shown to predict clinical 
modulator response have proven useful in this setting (e.g., studies of 
primary airway or other well-validated epithelial monolayers, organoid 
cultures) and are being advanced as a potential means to expand regu-
latory approval for uncommon variants.

Progress  in  CF  drug  discovery  is  emblematic  of  what  might 
be  accomplished  in  other  refractory  inherited  conditions  using  an 
approach grounded in molecular mechanism and unbiased compound 
library screening. Genetic manipulation (CFTR gene transfer, certain 
types  of  genome  editing,  etc.)  and  airway  progenitor  cell  treatments 
comprise  experimental  strategies  less  dependent  on  a  specific  (i.e., 
personalized) CFTR mutation. Such approaches will require efficient, 
durable, and safe in vivo delivery, with particular emphasis on CF lung 
disease.
 ■ THERAPEUTICS DIRECTED TOWARD CF 
SEQUELAE
Chronic Outpatient Management, Including Relationship to 
Modulators  Standard  care  for  patients  with  CF  is  intensive,  with 
outpatient regimens that include exogenous pancreatic enzymes taken 
with  meals,  nutritional  supplementation,  anti-inflammatory  medica-
tion, bronchodilators, and chronic or periodic administration of oral or 
aerosolized antibiotics (e.g., as maintenance therapy for patients with P. 
aeruginosa). Recombinant DNAse aerosols (degrade DNA strands that 
contribute to mucus viscosity) and nebulized hypertonic saline (serves 
to  augment  PCL  depth,  activate  mucociliary  clearance,  and  mobi-
lize  inspissated  airway  secretions)  are  administered  routinely.  Chest 
physiotherapy several times each day is a standard means to promote 
clearance  of  airway  mucus.  Among  adults  with  CF,  malabsorption, 
chronic inflammation, and endocrine abnormalities can lead to poor 
bone mineralization, requiring treatment with vitamin D, calcium, and 
other measures. The time, complexity, and expense of home care are 
considerable and take a significant toll on patients and their families.

Chronic sequelae of CF have received particular attention in the era 
of highly effective modulator treatment, since patients with established 
CF lung disease given TCT or other formulations continue to exhibit 
respiratory infection and inflammation despite clinical improvement. 
Moreover, impact of CFTR modulators has not been well characterized 
for  many  extrapulmonary  manifestations  of  the  disease.  Improved 
treatments  that  address  ongoing  respiratory  infection/inflammation, 
nutritional deficits, hepatic and endocrine abnormalities, mucostasis, 
or  other  features  that  persist  despite  modulator  treatment  remain  a 
priority. Opportunities to define better these aspects of CF and simplify 
therapeutic regimens among patients recently started on TCT are the 
focus of several multicenter trials.

Pulmonary Exacerbation  Severe  CF  respiratory  exacerbation  is 
commonly  managed  by  hospital  admission  for  parenteral  antibiotics 
and  frequent  chest  physiotherapy  directed  against  (often  multidrug- 
resistant)  bacterial  pathogens.  Aggressive  intervention  in  this  setting 
can  restore  a  large  component  of  lung  function,  but  ongoing  and 
cumulative loss of pulmonary reserve has traditionally reflected natural 
history of the disease. Poor prognostic indicators such as sputum cul-
ture  containing  Burkholderia  cepacia  complex,  mucoid  P.  aeruginosa, 
or  atypical  mycobacteria  are  rigorously  monitored  in  the  CF  patient 
population. An increasing incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus 
has  also  been  observed  and  may  be  associated  with  poor  outcomes. 
Typical inpatient antibiotic coverage includes combination drug ther-
apy with an aminoglycoside and β-lactam for at least 14 days. Maximal 
improvement in lung function is often achieved by 8–10 days in that 
setting, although optimal duration of therapy is a subject of continu-
ing  investigation.  Many  families  elect  parenteral  antibiotic  treatment 
at  home,  but  additional  studies  are  needed  to  evaluate  specific  drug 
combinations, duration of therapy, and home versus inpatient manage-
ment. Other CF respiratory sequelae that may require hospitalization 
include hemoptysis and pneumothorax. Hypersensitivity to Aspergillus 
(allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) occurs in ~5% of individuals 
with the disease and should be considered in the absence of favorable 
response  to  aggressive  inpatient  treatment.  Contributions  of  viral 
infection (including SARS-CoV-2) during acute CF respiratory decline 
represent an area of intense clinical interest.
Lung  Transplantation  For  end-stage  CF  pulmonary  failure, 
transplantation  is  a  viable  therapeutic  option  with  median  survival  
>9  years  among  adults  with  the  disease.  Determining  optimal  timing 
for surgery presents a substantial challenge in patients with severe respi-
ratory  compromise,  particularly  since  the  rate  of  continued  functional 
decline,  as  well  as  individualized  mortality  risk  from  transplantation, 
can be difficult to predict. FEV1 measurements <30% predicted, together 
with  an  assortment  of  other  clinical  parameters  (hospitalization  fre-
quency,  need  for  supplemental  oxygen,  etc.),  are  employed  as  thresh-
olds  for  transplant  referral,  although  patients  with  conditions  such  as 
significant  pulmonary  hypertension  may  merit  consultation  at  higher 
FEV1.  Based  on  clinical  outcome  and  other  features,  eligible  patients 
with CF and their families sometimes do not pursue a surgical option. 
The decision is best approached through early discussions with health 
care  providers  specializing  in  both  CF  clinical  management  and 
transplantation.
 ■ CF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
As a direct result of advances in basic research, modulator and other 
therapies  are  transforming  CF  from  a  disease  that  historically  led  to 
death in early childhood to a condition with frequent survival well into 
the  fourth  decade  of  life  and  beyond.  Although  initiating  modulator 
treatment  in  young  children  may  extend  longevity  even  further  by 
forestalling  pulmonary  damage,  this  prediction  will  require  formal 
evaluation.  As  modulatory  therapies  advance,  carefully  standardized 
approaches to management will be essential. Well-defined protocols for 
CF care have been widely established, including thresholds for hospital 
admission,  antibiotic  regimens,  nutritional  guidelines,  periodicity  of 
diagnostic  tests,  and  other  clinical  parameters.  These  recommenda-
tions  are  accepted  throughout  specialized  CF  care  centers  and  other 
accredited  programs.  Such  measures  have  led  to  markedly  improved 
pulmonary  function,  weight  gain,  body  mass  index,  and  other  clin-
ical  endpoints  among  patients  with  the  disease.  The  same  approach 
is  expected  to  optimize  benefit  attributable  to  CFTR  modulation. 
Standardized protocols for CF therapy can be accessed at www.cff.org/
treatments/cfcareguidelines/ or through a number of excellent reviews.
 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Newborn  screening  for  CF  is  universal  throughout  the  United  States 
and Canadian provinces, Australia, New Zealand, and much of Europe, 
and facilitates early intervention. Nutritional and other therapies at a 
young  age  are  expected  to  promote  quality  of  life  and  increase  lon-
gevity.  Global  implementation  of  quality  improvement  measures  and 
access to novel therapeutics have become increasing imperatives. For

2180 example,  median  survival  among  individuals  with  CF  is  <30  years 
in  much  of  Latin  America  (compared  to  >45  years  in  the  United 
States).  The  less  favorable  prognosis  is  attributable  in  part  to  lack  of 
widespread  diagnostic  capabilities  (i.e.,  newborn  screening,  sweat 
testing, and genetic analysis tailored to ethnic background), together 
with  insufficient  access  to  leading-edge,  interdisciplinary  treatment. 
Efforts  to  apply  state-of-the-art  management  to  underdiagnosed  and 
underserved CF patient populations will help improve outcomes and 
mitigate CF health disparities in the future.

292 Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease
Edwin K. Silverman, James D. Crapo,  
Barry J. Make

Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  is  defined  as  a 
disease  state  characterized  by  persistent  respiratory  symptoms  and 
airflow  obstruction  (https://goldcopd.org/2021-gold-reports/).  COPD 
includes emphysema, an anatomically defined condition characterized 

by destruction of the lung alveoli with air space enlargement; chronic 
bronchitis,  a  clinically  defined  condition  with  chronic  cough  and 
phlegm;  and/or  small  airway  disease,  a  condition  in  which  small 
bronchioles are narrowed and reduced in number. The classic defini-
tion  of  COPD  requires  the  presence  of  chronic  airflow  obstruction, 
determined by spirometry, that usually occurs in the setting of noxious 
environmental  exposures—most  commonly  products  of  combustion, 
cigarette smoking in the United States, and biomass fuels in some other 
countries. Host factors such as abnormal lung development and genet-
ics can lead to COPD. Emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and small air-
way disease are present in varying degrees in different COPD patients. 
Patients  with  a  history  of  cigarette  smoking  without  chronic  airflow 
obstruction  may  have  chronic  bronchitis,  emphysema,  and  dyspnea. 
Although these patients are not included within the classic definition of 
COPD, they may have similar disease processes. Respiratory symptoms 
and other features of COPD can occur in subjects who do not meet a 
definition of COPD based only on airflow obstruction determined by 
spirometric  population  thresholds  of  normality.  Investigators  in  the 
COPDGene study recently proposed a multidimensional approach to 
COPD diagnosis, which is based on domains of environmental expo-
sures,  respiratory  symptoms,  imaging  abnormalities,  and  physiologic 
abnormalities.

COPD is the fourth leading cause of death and affects >10 million 
persons  in  the  United  States.  COPD  is  also  a  disease  of  increasing 
public health importance around the world. Globally, there are an esti-
mated 250 million individuals with COPD.

PATHOGENESIS
Airflow obstruction, the physiologic marker of COPD, can result from 
airway  disease  and/or  emphysema.  Small  airways  may  become  nar-
rowed  by  cells  (hyperplasia  and  accumulation),  mucus,  and  fibrosis, 
and  extensive  small  airway  destruction  has  been  demonstrated  to  be 
a  hallmark  of  COPD.  Although  the  precise  biological  mechanisms 
leading  to  COPD  have  not  been  determined,  a  number  of  key  cell 
types,  molecules,  and  pathways  have  been  identified  from  cell-based 
and animal model studies. The pathogenesis of emphysema (shown in  
Fig.  292-1)  is  more  clearly  defined  than  the  pathogenesis  of  small 
airway disease. Pulmonary vascular destruction occurs in concert with 
small airway disease and emphysema.

The current dominant paradigm for the pathogenesis of emphysema 
comprises a series of four interrelated events: (1) Chronic exposure to 
cigarette smoke in genetically susceptible individuals triggers inflam-
matory  and  immune  cell  recruitment  within  large  and  small  airways 
and in the terminal air spaces of the lung. (2) Inflammatory cells release 
proteinases  that  damage  the  extracellular  matrix  supporting  airways, 
vasculature, and gas exchange surfaces of the lung. (3) Structural cell 
death  occurs  through  oxidant-induced  damage,  cellular  senescence, 
and proteolytic loss of cellular-matrix attachments leading to extensive 
loss of smaller airways, vascular pruning, and alveolar destruction. (4) 
Disordered repair of elastin and other extracellular matrix components 
contributes to air space enlargement and emphysema.
 ■ INFLAMMATION AND EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX 
PROTEOLYSIS
Elastin,  the  principal  component  of  elastic  fibers,  is  a  highly  stable 
component  of  the  extracellular  matrix  that  is  critical  to  the  integrity 
of the lung. The elastase:antielastase hypothesis, proposed in the mid-
1960s,  postulated  that  the  balance  of  elastin-degrading  enzymes  and 
their  inhibitors  determines  the  susceptibility  of  the  lung  to  destruc-
tion,  resulting  in  air  space  enlargement.  This  hypothesis  was  based 
on the clinical observation that patients with genetic deficiency in α1  
antitrypsin  (α1AT),  the  inhibitor  of  the  serine  proteinase  neutrophil 
elastase,  were  at  increased  risk  of  emphysema,  and  that  instillation 
of  elastases,  including  neutrophil  elastase,  into  experimental  animals 
results  in  emphysema.  The  elastase:antielastase  hypothesis  remains  a 
prevailing  mechanism  for  the  development  of  emphysema.  However, 
a complex network of immune and inflammatory cells and additional 
biological mechanisms that contribute to emphysema have subsequently 
been identified. Upon exposure to oxidants from cigarette smoke, lung

FIGURE  292-1  Pathogenesis  of  emphysema.  Upon  long-term  exposure  to  cigarette  smoke  in  genetically  susceptible  individuals,  lung  epithelial  cells  and  T  and  B 
lymphocytes recruit inflammatory cells to the lung. Biological pathways of protease-antiprotease imbalance, oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, apoptosis, and lung repair lead 
to extracellular matrix destruction, cell death, chronic inflammation, and ineffective repair. Although most of these biological pathways influence multiple pathobiological 
results, only a single relationship between pathways and results is shown. A subset of key molecules related to these biological pathways is listed.

macrophages  and  epithelial  cells  become  activated,  producing  pro-
teinases and chemokines that attract other inflammatory and immune 
cells. Oxidative stress is a key component of COPD pathobiology; the 
transcription  factor  NRF2,  a  major  regulator  of  oxidant-antioxidant 
balance,  and  SOD3,  a  potent  antioxidant,  have  been  implicated  in 
emphysema  pathogenesis  by  animal  models.  Mitochondrial  dysfunc-
tion in COPD may worsen oxidative stress. One mechanism of mac-
rophage activation occurs via oxidant-induced inactivation of histone 
deacetylase-2 (HDAC2), shifting the balance toward acetylated or open 
chromatin, exposing nuclear factor-κB sites, and resulting in transcrip-
tion of matrix metalloproteinases and proinflammatory cytokines such 
as interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); this leads 
to neutrophil recruitment. CD8+ T cells are also recruited in response 
to cigarette smoke and release interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10, 
CXCL-7),  which  in  turn  leads  to  macrophage  production  of  macro-
phage elastase (matrix metalloproteinase-12 [MMP-12]).

Matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteinases, most notably neu-
trophil elastase, work together by degrading the inhibitor of the other, 
leading  to  lung  destruction.  Proteolytic  cleavage  products  of  elastin 
serve  as  a  macrophage  chemokine,  and  proline-glycine-proline  (gen-
erated by proteolytic cleavage of collagen) is a neutrophil chemokine—
fueling  this  destructive  positive  feedback  loop.  Elastin  degradation 
and  disordered  repair  are  thought  to  be  primary  mechanisms  in  the 
development of emphysema.

There is some evidence that autoimmune mechanisms may promote 
the  progression  of  disease.  Increased  B  cells  and  lymphoid  follicles 
are  present  around  the  airways  of  COPD  patients,  particularly  those 
with  advanced  disease.  Antibodies  have  been  found  against  elastin 
fragments as well; IgG autoantibodies with avidity for pulmonary epi-
thelium and the potential to mediate cytotoxicity have been detected.

Concomitant  cigarette  smoke–induced  loss  of  cilia  in  the  airway 
epithelium  and  impaired  macrophage  phagocytosis  predispose  to 

bacterial  infection  with  neutrophilia.  In  end-stage  lung  disease,  long 
after  smoking  cessation,  there  remains  an  exuberant  inflammatory 
response,  suggesting  that  cigarette  smoke–induced  inflammation 
both  initiates  the  disease  and,  in  susceptible  individuals,  establishes 
a  chronic  process  that  can  continue  disease  progression  even  after 
smoking cessation.

Cell Death  Cigarette smoke oxidant-mediated structural cell death 
occurs  via  a  variety  of  mechanisms  including  excessive  ceramide 
production and Rtp801 inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR),  leading  to  cell  death  as  well  as  inflammation  and  prote-
olysis.  Involvement  of  mTOR  and  other  cellular  senescence  markers 
has led to the concept that emphysema resembles premature aging of 
the  lung.  Heterozygous  gene-targeting  of  one  of  the  leading  genetic 
determinants of COPD identified by genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS),  hedgehog  interacting  protein  (HHIP),  in  a  murine  model 
leads to aging-related emphysema.

Ineffective  Repair  The  ability  of  the  adult  lung  to  replace  lost 
smaller  airways  and  microvasculature  and  to  repair  damaged  alveoli 
appears  limited.  Uptake  of  apoptotic  cells  by  macrophages  normally 
results  in  production  of  growth  factors  and  dampens  inflammation, 
promoting  lung  repair.  Cigarette  smoke  impairs  macrophage  uptake 
of  apoptotic  cells,  limiting  repair.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  intricate  and 
dynamic  process  of  septation  that  is  responsible  for  alveologenesis 
during lung development can be reinitiated in the adult human lung.

PATHOLOGY
Cigarette smoke exposure may affect the large airways, small airways 
(≤2 mm diameter), and alveoli. Changes in large airways cause cough 
and  sputum  production,  while  changes  in  small  airways  and  alveoli 
are  responsible  for  physiologic  alterations.  Airway  inflammation,

destruction, and the development of emphysema are present in most 
persons with COPD; however, they appear to be relatively independent 
processes, and their relative contributions to obstruction vary from one 
person to another. The early stages of COPD, based on the severity of 
airflow  obstruction  (Table  292-1),  appear  to  be  primarily  associated 
with  medium  and  small  airway  disease  with  the  majority  of  Global 
Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) spirometric 
airflow obstruction stage 1 and stage 2 subjects demonstrating little or 
no emphysema. The early development of chronic airflow obstruction 
is driven by small airway disease. Advanced stages of COPD (GOLD 
stages  3  and  4)  are  typically  characterized  by  extensive  emphysema, 
although there are a small number of subjects with very severe (GOLD 
stage  4)  obstruction  with  virtually  no  emphysema.  The  subjects  at 
greatest  risk  of  progression  in  COPD  are  those  with  both  aggressive 
airway  disease  and  emphysema.  Thus,  finding  emphysema  (by  chest 
computed tomography [CT]) either early or late in the disease process 
suggests enhanced risk for disease progression.

 ■ LARGE AIRWAYS
Cigarette smoking often results in mucus gland enlargement and goblet 
cell  hyperplasia,  leading  to  cough  and  mucus  production  that  define 
chronic  bronchitis,  but  these  abnormalities  are  not  directly  related 
to  airflow  obstruction.  In  response  to  cigarette  smoking,  goblet  cells 
increase not only in number but also in extent through the bronchial 
tree.  Bronchi  also  undergo  squamous  metaplasia,  predisposing  to 
carcinogenesis  and  disrupting  mucociliary  clearance.  Although  not 
as prominent as in asthma, patients may have smooth-muscle hyper-
trophy  and  bronchial  hyperreactivity  leading  to  airflow  obstruction. 
Neutrophil  influx  has  been  associated  with  purulent  sputum  during

alveolar entrances. Narrowing and drop-out of small airways precede 
the  onset  of  emphysematous  destruction.  Advanced  COPD  has  been 
shown to be associated with a loss of many of the smaller airways and 
a similar significant loss of the lung microvasculature.
 ■ LUNG PARENCHYMA
Emphysema is characterized by destruction of gas-exchanging air spaces, 
i.e., the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Large num-
bers of macrophages accumulate in respiratory bronchioles of essentially 
all  smokers.  Neutrophils,  B  lymphocytes,  and  T  lymphocytes,  partic-
ularly  CD8+  cells,  are  also  increased  in  the  alveolar  space  of  smokers. 
Alveolar walls become perforated and later obliterated with coalescence 
of the delicate alveolar structure into large emphysematous air spaces.

Emphysema  is  classified  into  distinct  pathologic  types,  which 
include centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal (Fig 292-2). Centri-
lobular emphysema, the type most frequently associated with cigarette 
smoking,  is  characterized  by  enlarged  air  spaces  found  (initially)  in 
association with respiratory bronchioles. Centrilobular emphysema is 
usually most prominent in the upper lobes and superior segments of 
lower  lobes  and  is  often  quite  focal.  Panlobular  emphysema  refers  to 
abnormally large air spaces evenly distributed within and across acinar 
units. Panlobular emphysema is commonly observed in patients with 
α1AT deficiency, which has a predilection for the lower lobes. Parasep-
tal emphysema occurs in 10–15% of cases and is distributed along the 
pleural margins with relative sparing of the lung core or central regions. 
It  is  commonly  associated  with  significant  airway  inflammation  and 
with centrilobular emphysema.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Persistent reduction in forced expiratory flow rates is the classic defi-
nition of COPD. Hyperinflation with increases in the residual volume 
and the residual volume/total lung capacity ratio, nonuniform distribu-
tion of ventilation, and ventilation-perfusion mismatching also occur.
 ■ AIRFLOW OBSTRUCTION
Airflow  obstruction,  also  known  as  airflow  limitation,  is  typically 
determined for clinical purposes by spirometry, which involves maxi-
mal forced expiratory maneuvers after the subject has inhaled to total 
lung  capacity.  Key  parameters  obtained  from  spirometry  include  the 
volume of air exhaled within the first second of the forced expiratory 
maneuver (FEV1) and the total volume of air exhaled during the entire 
spirometric  maneuver  (forced  vital  capacity  [FVC]).  Patients  with 
airflow obstruction related to COPD have a chronically reduced ratio 
of FEV1/FVC. In contrast to asthma, the reduced FEV1 in COPD sel-
dom shows large improvements to inhaled bronchodilators, although 
improvements up to 15% are common.
 ■ HYPERINFLATION
Lung  volumes  are  also  routinely  assessed  in  pulmonary  function 
testing.  In  COPD,  there  is  often  “air  trapping”  (increased  residual 
volume and increased ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity) 

 ■ SMALL AIRWAYS
The  major  site  of  increased  resistance 
in  most  individuals  with  COPD  is  in 
airways  ≤2  mm  diameter.  Characteris-
tic  cellular  changes  include  goblet  cell 
metaplasia,  with  these  mucus-secreting 
cells replacing surfactant-secreting Club 
cells.  Smooth-muscle  hypertrophy  may 
also be present. Luminal narrowing can 
occur by fibrosis, excess mucus, edema, 
and cellular infiltration. Reduced surfac-
tant may increase surface tension at the 
air-tissue  interface,  predisposing  to  air-
way  narrowing  or  collapse.  Respiratory 
bronchiolitis  with  mononuclear  inflam-
matory  cells  collecting  in  distal  airway 
tissues may cause proteolytic destruction 
of elastic fibers in the respiratory bron-
chioles  and  alveolar  ducts  where  the 
fibers  are  concentrated  as  rings  around

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemand progressive hyperinflation (increased total lung capacity) in more 
advanced  disease.  Hyperinflation  of  the  thorax  during  tidal  breath-
ing  preserves  maximum  expiratory  airflow,  because  as  lung  volume 
increases, elastic recoil pressure increases, and airways enlarge so that 
airway resistance decreases.

Despite  compensating  for  airway  obstruction,  hyperinflation  can 
push the diaphragm into a flattened position with a number of adverse 
effects.  First,  by  decreasing  the  zone  of  apposition  between  the  dia-
phragm and the abdominal wall, positive abdominal pressure during 
inspiration is not applied as effectively to the chest wall, hindering rib 
cage movement and impairing inspiration. Second, because the muscle 
fibers of the flattened diaphragm are shorter than those of a more nor-
mally curved diaphragm, they are less capable of generating inspiratory 
pressures than normal. Third, the flattened diaphragm must generate 
greater  tension  to  develop  the  transpulmonary  pressure  required  to 
produce tidal breathing. Fourth, the thoracic cage is distended beyond 
its normal resting volume, and during tidal breathing, the inspiratory 
muscles must do work to overcome the resistance of the thoracic cage 
to further inflation instead of gaining the normal assistance from the 
chest wall recoiling outward toward its resting volume.

 ■ GAS EXCHANGE
Although there is considerable variability in the relationships between 
the FEV1 and other physiologic abnormalities in COPD, certain gener-
alizations may be made. The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood 
Pao2 usually remains near normal until the FEV1 is decreased to below 
50% of predicted, and even much lower FEV1 values can be associated 
with  a  normal  Pao2,  at  least  at  rest.  An  elevation  of  arterial  level  of 
carbon dioxide (Paco2) is not expected until the FEV1 is <25% of pre-
dicted and even then may not occur. Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
severe enough to cause cor pulmonale and right ventricular failure due 
to COPD typically occurs in individuals who have marked decreases in 
FEV1 (<25% of predicted) and chronic hypoxemia (Pao2 <55 mmHg); 
however, some patients develop significant pulmonary arterial hyper-
tension independent of COPD severity (Chap. 283).

Nonuniform  ventilation  and  ventilation-perfusion  mismatching 
are characteristic of COPD, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the 
disease process within the airways and lung parenchyma. Physiologic 
studies are consistent with multiple parenchymal compartments having 
different rates of ventilation due to regional differences in compliance 
and airway resistance. Ventilation-perfusion mismatching accounts for 
essentially all of the reduction in Pao2 that occurs in COPD; shunting 
is minimal. This finding explains the effectiveness of modest elevations 
of inspired oxygen in treating hypoxemia due to COPD and therefore 
the need to consider problems other than COPD when hypoxemia is 
difficult to correct with modest levels of supplemental oxygen.

RISK FACTORS
 ■ CIGARETTE SMOKING
By  1964,  the  Advisory  Committee  to  the  Surgeon  General  of  the 
United States had concluded that cigarette smoking was a major risk 
factor  for  mortality  from  chronic  bronchitis  and  emphysema.  Sub-
sequent  longitudinal  studies  have  shown  accelerated  decline  in  FEV1 
in  a  dose-response  relationship  to  the  intensity  of  cigarette  smoking, 
which  is  typically  expressed  as  pack-years  (average  number  of  packs 
of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the total number of years 
of  smoking).  This  dose-response  relationship  between  reduced  pul-
monary function and cigarette smoking intensity accounts, at least in 
part, for the higher prevalence rates of COPD with increasing age. The 
historically higher rate of smoking among males is the likely explana-
tion  for  the  higher  prevalence  of  COPD  among  males;  however,  the 
prevalence of COPD among females is increasing as the gender gap in 
smoking rates has diminished in the past 50 years.

Although  the  causal  relationship  between  cigarette  smoking  and 
the  development  of  COPD  has  been  absolutely  proved,  there  is  con-
siderable individual variability in the response to smoking. Pack-years 
of cigarette smoking is the most highly significant predictor of FEV1 
(Fig. 292-3),  but  only  15%  of  the  variability  in  FEV1  is  explained  by

pack-years. This finding suggests that additional environmental and/
or genetic factors contribute to the impact of smoking on the develop-
ment of chronic airflow obstruction. Nonetheless, many patients with 
a history of cigarette smoking with normal spirometry have evidence 
for worse health-related quality of life, reduced exercise capacity, and 
emphysema and/or airway disease on chest CT evaluation; thus, they 
have not escaped the harmful effects of cigarette smoking. While they 
do not meet the classic definition of COPD based on population nor-
mals for FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, studies have shown that these subjects 
overall have a shift toward lower FEV1 values, which is consistent with 
obstruction on an individual level.

Although cigar and pipe smoking may also be associated with the 
development  of  COPD,  the  evidence  supporting  such  associations  is 
less  compelling,  likely  related  to  the  lower  dose  of  inhaled  tobacco 
by-products during cigar and pipe smoking. The impact of electronic 
cigarettes  and  vaping  on  the  development  and  progression  of  COPD 
has not yet been determined.

 ■ AIRWAY RESPONSIVENESS AND COPD
A tendency for increased bronchoconstriction in response to a variety 
of exogenous stimuli, including methacholine and histamine, is one of 
the defining features of asthma (Chap. 287). However, many patients 
with COPD also share this feature of airway hyperresponsiveness. In 
older  subjects,  there  is  considerable  overlap  between  persons  with  a 
history of chronic asthma and smokers with COPD in terms of airway 
responsiveness,  airflow  obstruction,  and  pulmonary  symptoms.  The 
origin of asthma is viewed in many patients as an allergic disease while 
COPD is thought to primarily result from smoking-related inflamma-
tion  and  damage;  however,  they  likely  share  common  environmental 
and genetic factors and the chronic form in older subjects can present 
similarly. This is particularly relevant for childhood asthmatic subjects 
who become chronic smokers.

Longitudinal studies that compared airway responsiveness to subse-
quent decline in pulmonary function have demonstrated that increased

2184 airway  responsiveness  is  clearly  a  significant  predictor  of  subsequent 
decline in pulmonary function. A study from the Childhood Asthma 
Management Program identified four lung function trajectories in chil-
dren  with  persistent  asthma.  Asthmatics  with  reduced  lung  function 
early in life were more likely to meet spirometric criteria for COPD in 
early adulthood. Both asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness are risk 
factors for COPD.

 ■ RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS
The  impact  of  adult  respiratory  infections  on  decline  in  pulmonary 
function is controversial, but significant long-term reductions in pul-
monary function are not typically seen following an individual episode 
of acute bronchitis or pneumonia. However, respiratory infections are 
important causes of COPD exacerbations, and recent results from the 
COPDGene  and  ECLIPSE  studies  suggest  that  COPD  exacerbations 
are  associated  with  increased  loss  of  lung  function  longitudinally, 
particularly  among  those  individuals  with  better  baseline  lung  func-
tion levels. The impact of the effects of childhood respiratory illnesses 
on the subsequent development of COPD has been difficult to assess 
due  to  a  lack  of  adequate  longitudinal  data,  but  recent  studies  have 
suggested  that  childhood  pneumonia  may  lead  to  increased  risk  for 
COPD later in life.

 ■ OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES
Increased  respiratory  symptoms  and  airflow  obstruction  have  been 
suggested to result from exposure to dust and fumes. Several specific 
occupational exposures, including coal mining, gold mining, and cot-
ton textile dust, have been implicated as risk factors for chronic airflow 
obstruction. Although nonsmokers in these occupations can develop 
some  reductions  in  FEV1,  the  importance  of  dust  exposure  as  a  risk 
factor for COPD, independent of cigarette smoking, is not certain for 
most of these exposures. However, among coal miners, coal mine dust 
exposure was a significant risk factor for emphysema in both smokers 
and nonsmokers. In most cases, the magnitude of these occupational 
exposures on COPD risk is likely substantially less important than the 
effect of cigarette smoking.

 ■ AMBIENT AIR POLLUTION
Some  investigators  have  reported  increased  respiratory  symptoms  in 
those  living  in  urban  compared  to  rural  areas,  which  may  relate  to 
increased  pollution  in  the  urban  settings.  However,  the  relationship 
of  air  pollution  to  chronic  airflow  obstruction  remains  unproved. 
Prolonged  exposure  to  smoke  produced  by  biomass  combustion—a 
common  mode  of  cooking  in  some  countries—also  appears  to  be  a 
significant risk factor for COPD, particularly among women.

 ■ PASSIVE, OR SECOND-HAND, SMOKING 
EXPOSURE
Exposure  of  children  to  maternal  smoking  results  in  significantly 
reduced  lung  growth.  In  utero,  tobacco  smoke  exposure  also  con-
tributes  to  significant  reductions  in  postnatal  pulmonary  function. 
Although passive smoke exposure has been associated with reductions 
in pulmonary function, the importance of this risk factor in the devel-
opment of the severe pulmonary function reductions often observed in 
COPD remains uncertain.

 ■ GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS

Although cigarette smoking is the major environmental risk fac-
tor  for  the  development  of  COPD,  the  development  of  airflow 
obstruction in smokers is highly variable. Severe α1AT deficiency 
is a proven genetic risk factor for COPD; there is increasing evidence 
that other genetic determinants also exist.
α1 Antitrypsin Deficiency  Many variants of the protease inhib-
itor (PI or SERPINA1) locus that encodes α1AT have been described. 
The  common  M  allele  is  associated  with  normal  α1AT  levels.  The  S 
allele,  associated  with  slightly  reduced  α1AT  levels,  and  the  Z  allele, 
associated  with  markedly  reduced  α1AT  levels,  also  occur  with  fre-
quencies  of  >1%  in  most  white  populations.  Rare  individuals  inherit 
null alleles, which lead to the absence of any α1AT production through 

a heterogeneous collection of mutations. Individuals with two Z alleles 
or one Z and one null allele are referred to as PiZ, which is the most 
common form of severe α1AT deficiency.

Although only ~1% of COPD patients are found to have severe α1AT 
deficiency as a contributing cause of COPD, these patients demonstrate 
that genetic factors can have a profound influence on the susceptibility 
for developing COPD. PiZ individuals often develop early-onset COPD, 
but the ascertainment bias in the published series of PiZ individuals—
which  have  usually  included  many  PiZ  subjects  who  were  tested  for 
α1AT deficiency because they had COPD—means that the fraction of 
PiZ individuals who will develop COPD and the age-of-onset distribu-
tion for the development of COPD in PiZ subjects remain unknown. 
Approximately  1  in  3000  individuals  in  the  United  States  inherits 
severe α1AT deficiency, but only a small minority of these individuals 
has been identified. The clinical laboratory test used most frequently 
to screen for α1AT deficiency is measurement of the immunologic level 
of α1AT in serum (see “Laboratory Findings”).

A  significant  percentage  of  the  variability  in  pulmonary  function 
among  PiZ  individuals  is  explained  by  cigarette  smoking;  cigarette 
smokers with severe α1AT deficiency are more likely to develop COPD 
at early ages. However, the development of COPD in PiZ subjects, even 
among current or ex-smokers, is not absolute. Among PiZ nonsmokers, 
impressive  variability  has  been  noted  in  the  development  of  airflow 
obstruction. Asthma and male gender also appear to increase the risk 
of COPD in PiZ subjects. Other genetic and/or environmental factors 
likely contribute to this variability.

Specific  treatment  in  the  form  of  α1AT  augmentation  therapy  is 
available for severe α1AT deficiency as a weekly IV infusion (see “Treat-
ment,” below).

The risk of lung disease in heterozygous PiMZ individuals, who have 
intermediate serum levels of α1AT (~60% of PiMM levels), has been con-
troversial. Several recent studies have demonstrated that PiMZ subjects 
who smoke are likely at increased risk for the development of COPD. 
However, α1AT augmentation therapy is not recommended for use in 
PiMZ subjects.

Other Genetic Risk Factors  Studies of pulmonary function mea-
surements  performed  in  general  population  samples  have  indicated 
that genetic factors other than PI type influence variation in pulmo-
nary function. Familial aggregation of airflow obstruction within fam-
ilies of COPD patients has also been demonstrated.

GWAS  have  identified  >80  regions  of  the  genome  that  contain 
COPD  susceptibility  loci,  including  a  region  near  the  HHIP  gene 
on  chromosome  4,  a  cluster  of  genes  on  chromosome  15  (including 
components of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and another gene, 
IREB2, related to mitochondrial iron regulation), and a region within 
a gene of unknown function (FAM13A). As with most other complex 
diseases, the risk associated with individual GWAS loci is modest, but 
these genetic determinants may identify important biological pathways 
related to COPD. Gene-targeted murine models for HHIP, FAM13A, 
and IREB2 exposed to chronic cigarette smoke had altered emphysema 
susceptibility, suggesting that those genes are likely to be involved in 
COPD pathogenesis.

NATURAL HISTORY
The  effects  of  cigarette  smoking  on  pulmonary  function  appear  to 
depend  on  the  intensity  of  smoking  exposure,  the  timing  of  smok-
ing exposure during growth and development, and the baseline lung 
function  of  the  individual;  other  environmental  factors  may  have 
similar effects. Most individuals follow a steady trajectory of increasing 
pulmonary function with growth during childhood and adolescence, 
followed  by  a  plateau  in  early  adulthood,  and  then  gradual  decline 
with aging. Individuals appear to track in their quantile of pulmonary 
function  based  on  environmental  and  genetic  factors  that  put  them 
on  different  tracks.  The  risk  of  eventual  mortality  from  COPD  is 
closely associated with reduced levels of FEV1. A graphic depiction of 
the natural history of COPD is shown as a function of the influences 
on  tracking  curves  of  FEV1  in  Fig.  292-4.  Death  or  disability  from 
COPD can result from a normal rate of decline after a reduced growth

phase  (curve  C),  an  early  initiation  of  pulmonary  function  decline 
after normal growth (curve B), or an accelerated decline after normal 
growth (curve D). Although accelerated rates of lung function decline 
have classically been associated with COPD, recent analyses of several  
population-based  cohorts  demonstrated  that  many  subjects  meeting 
the  spirometric  criteria  for  COPD  had  reduced  growth  but  normal 
rates  of  lung  function  decline.  The  rate  of  decline  in  pulmonary 
function can be modified by changing environmental exposures (i.e., 
quitting smoking), with smoking cessation at an earlier age providing a 
more beneficial effect than smoking cessation after marked reductions 
in  pulmonary  function  have  already  developed.  The  absolute  annual 
loss  in  FEV1  tends  to  be  highest  in  mild  COPD  and  lowest  in  very 
severe COPD. Multiple genetic factors influence the level of pulmonary 
function achieved during growth.

In chronic smokers, substantial chest CT changes (emphysema and 
airway wall thickening) have been identified in subjects with normal 
physiology  (normal  FEV1  and  FEV1/FVC).  COPD  in  these  subjects 
commonly  progresses  in  two  primary  patterns.  Subjects  with  an 
emphysema-predominant  pattern  show  emphysema  early  and  classi-
cally progress through GOLD 1 to GOLD 2–4. Subjects with an airway 
disease–predominant pattern typically show initial evidence of airway 
inflammation and progress with little emphysema early as FEV1 falls 
while  retaining  a  normal  FEV1/FVC  ratio.  This  is  termed  preserved 
ratio–impaired spirometry (PRISm) physiology. These subjects tend to 
develop emphysema late and can progress directly to GOLD 3 and 4 
with severe, end-stage COPD.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
 ■ HISTORY
The three most common symptoms in COPD are cough, sputum pro-
duction, and exertional dyspnea. Many patients have such symptoms 
for  months  or  years  before  seeking  medical  attention.  Although  the 
development of airflow obstruction is a gradual process, many patients 
date  the  onset  of  their  disease  to  an  acute  illness  or  exacerbation. 
A  careful  history,  however,  usually  reveals  the  presence  of  respira-
tory  symptoms  prior  to  the  acute  exacerbation.  The  development  of 
exertional  dyspnea,  often  described  as  increased  effort  to  breathe, 
heaviness,  air  hunger,  or  gasping,  can  be  insidious.  It  is  best  elicited 
by a careful history focused on typical physical activities and how the 
patient’s  ability  to  perform  them  has  changed.  Activities  involving 
significant arm work, particularly at or above shoulder level, are par-
ticularly difficult for many patients with COPD. Conversely, activities 
that allow the patient to brace the arms and use accessory muscles of 
respiration  are  better  tolerated.  Examples  of  such  activities  include 

pushing a shopping cart or walking on a treadmill. As COPD advances, 
the principal feature is worsening dyspnea on exertion with increasing 
intrusion on the ability to perform vocational or avocational activities. 
In the most advanced stages, patients are breathless doing basic activ-
ities of daily living.

Accompanying  worsening  airflow  obstruction  is  an  increased  fre-
quency of exacerbations (described below). Patients may also develop 
resting hypoxemia and require institution of supplemental oxygen.

 ■ PHYSICAL FINDINGS
In the early stages of COPD, patients usually have an entirely normal 
physical examination. Current smokers may have signs of active smok-
ing,  including  an  odor  of  smoke  or  nicotine  staining  of  fingernails. 
In patients with more severe disease, the physical examination of the 
lungs is notable for a prolonged expiratory phase and may include expi-
ratory wheezing. In addition, signs of hyperinflation include a barrel 
chest and enlarged lung volumes with poor diaphragmatic excursion 
as  assessed  by  percussion.  Patients  with  severe  airflow  obstruction 
may also exhibit use of accessory muscles of respiration, sitting in the 
characteristic “tripod” position to facilitate the actions of the sternoc-
leidomastoid,  scalene,  and  intercostal  muscles.  Patients  may  develop 
cyanosis, visible in the lips and nail beds.

Traditional teaching is that patients with predominant emphysema, 
termed “pink puffers,” are thin, noncyanotic at rest, and have promi-
nent use of accessory muscles, and patients with chronic bronchitis are 
more likely to be heavy and cyanotic (“blue bloaters”). However, cur-
rent evidence demonstrates that most patients have elements of both 
chronic bronchitis and emphysema and that the physical examination 
does not reliably differentiate the two entities.

Advanced  disease  may  be  accompanied  by  cachexia,  with  signifi-
cant weight loss and diffuse loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue. This 
syndrome  has  been  associated  with  both  inadequate  oral  intake  and 
elevated  levels  of  inflammatory  cytokines  (TNF-α).  Such  wasting 
is  an  independent  poor  prognostic  factor  in  COPD.  Some  patients 
with advanced disease have paradoxical inward movement of the rib 
cage  with  inspiration  (Hoover’s  sign),  the  result  of  alteration  of  the 
vector  of  diaphragmatic  contraction  on  the  rib  cage  due  to  chronic 
hyperinflation.

Signs of overt right heart failure, termed cor pulmonale, are relatively 

infrequent since the advent of supplemental oxygen therapy.

Clubbing of the digits is not a sign of COPD, and its presence should 
alert  the  clinician  to  initiate  an  investigation  for  causes  of  clubbing. 
In COPD patients, the development of lung cancer is the most likely 
explanation for newly developed clubbing.

 ■ LABORATORY FINDINGS
The hallmark of COPD is airflow obstruction (discussed above). Pul-
monary  function  testing  shows  airflow  obstruction  with  a  reduction 
in  FEV1  and  FEV1/FVC  (Chap.  285).  With  worsening  disease  sever-
ity,  lung  volumes  may  increase,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  total  lung 
capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume. In patients 
with emphysema, the diffusing capacity may be reduced, reflecting the 
lung parenchymal destruction characteristic of the disease. The degree 
of airflow obstruction is an important prognostic factor in COPD and 
is  the  basis  for  the  GOLD  spirometric  severity  classification  (Table 
292-1). Although the degree of airflow obstruction generally correlates 
with the presence and severity of respiratory symptoms, exacerbations, 
emphysema,  and  hypoxemia,  the  correlations  are  far  from  perfect. 
Thus, clinical features should be carefully assessed in each individual 
patient with COPD to determine the most appropriate therapies. It has 
been shown that a multifactorial index (BODE), incorporating airflow 
obstruction, exercise performance, dyspnea, and body mass index, is 
a better predictor of mortality. Recently, GOLD added additional ele-
ments  to  their  COPD  classification  system  incorporating  respiratory 
symptoms  and  exacerbation  history;  these  metrics  are  used  to  guide 
COPD treatment (see below).

Arterial blood gases and oximetry may demonstrate resting or exer-
tional hypoxemia. Arterial blood gases provide additional information 
about  alveolar  ventilation  and  acid-base  status  by  measuring  arterial

acutely  and  0.03  units/10  mmHg  in  the  chronic  state.  Knowledge  of 
the arterial pH therefore allows the classification of ventilatory failure, 
defined  as  Pco2  >45  mmHg,  into  acute  or  chronic  conditions  with 
acute  respiratory  failure  being  associated  with  acidemia.  The  arterial 
blood  gas  is  an  important  component  of  the  evaluation  of  patients 
presenting with symptoms of an exacerbation. An elevated hematocrit 
suggests  the  presence  of  chronic  hypoxemia,  as  does  the  presence  of 
signs of right ventricular hypertrophy.

Radiographic studies may assist in the classification of the type of 
COPD. Increased lung volumes and flattening of the diaphragm sug-
gest  hyperinflation  but  do  not  provide  information  about  chronicity 
of  the  changes.  Obvious  bullae,  paucity  of  parenchymal  markings, 
or hyperlucency on chest x-ray suggests the presence of emphysema. 
Chest CT scan is the current definitive test for establishing the presence 
or absence of emphysema, the pattern of emphysema, and the presence 
of significant disease involving medium and large airways (Fig. 292-2). 
It also enables the discovery of coexisting interstitial lung disease and 
bronchiectasis. Smokers with COPD are at high risk for development 
of lung cancer, which can be identified on a chest CT scan. In advanced 
COPD,  CT  scans  can  help  determine  the  possible  value  of  surgical 
therapy (described below).

Recent  guidelines  have  suggested  testing  for  α1AT  deficiency  in 
all  subjects  with  COPD  or  asthma  with  chronic  airflow  obstruction. 
Measurement of the serum α1AT level is a reasonable initial test. For 
subjects  with  low  α1AT  levels,  the  definitive  diagnosis  of  α1AT  defi-
ciency requires PI type determination. This is typically performed by 
isoelectric  focusing  of  serum  or  plasma,  which  reflects  the  genotype 
at the PI locus for the common alleles and many of the rare PI alleles 
as  well.  Molecular  genotyping  can  be  performed  for  the  common  PI 
alleles (M, S, and Z), and DNA sequencing can detect other rare defi-
ciency variants.

TREATMENT
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 

STABLE PHASE COPD
The  two  main  goals  of  therapy  are  to  provide  symptomatic  relief 
(reduce  respiratory  symptoms,  improve  exercise  tolerance,  and 
improve health status) and reduce future risk (prevent disease pro-
gression,  prevent  and  treat  exacerbations,  and  reduce  mortality). 
The  institution  of  therapies  should  be  based  on  symptom  assess-
ment, benefits of therapy, potential risks, and costs. Figure 292-5 
provides the currently suggested categories of COPD patients based 
on  respiratory  symptoms  and  risk  for  exacerbations.  Response  to 
therapy should be assessed, and decisions should be made whether 
or not to continue or alter treatment.

Three  interventions—smoking  cessation,  oxygen  therapy  in 
chronically hypoxemic patients, and lung volume reduction surgery 
(LVRS) in selected patients with emphysema—have been demon-
strated to improve survival of patients with COPD. Recent studies 
indicate that triple inhaled therapy (long-acting beta agonist bron-
chodilator,  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist  bronchodilator  and 
inhaled corticosteroid) reduces mortality in selected patients with 
COPD. There is a suggestion that inhaled LAMA bronchodilators 
may reduce mortality.  
PHARMACOTHERAPY 
Smoking Cessation (See also Chap. 454) 
It has been shown that 
middle-aged smokers who were able to successfully stop smoking 
experienced  a  significant  improvement  in  the  rate  of  decline  in 
pulmonary  function,  often  returning  to  annual  changes  similar 
to  that  of  nonsmoking  patients.  In  addition,  smoking  cessation 
improves survival. Thus, all patients with COPD should be strongly 
urged to quit smoking and educated about the benefits of quitting. 
An emerging body of evidence demonstrates that combining phar-
macotherapy  with  traditional  supportive  approaches  considerably 
enhances  the  chances  of  successful  smoking  cessation.  There  are 

FIGURE 292-5  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) severity assessment. 
COPD  severity  categories  are  based  on  respiratory  symptoms  (based  on  the 
Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale [mMRC] or COPD Assessment 
Test [CAT]) and annual frequency of COPD exacerbations. The mMRC provides a 
single number for degree of breathlessness: 0—only with strenuous activity; 1—
hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill; 2—walk slower than peers or 
stop walking at their own pace; 3—walking about 100 yards or after a few minutes 
on level ground; 4—too breathless to leave the house or when dressing. The CAT is 
an eight-item COPD health status measure with Likert scale responses for questions 
about  cough,  phlegm,  chest  tightness,  dyspnea  on  one  flight  of  stairs,  limitation 
in  home  activities,  confidence  in  leaving  the  home,  sleep,  and  energy.  Range  of 
total  score  is  0–40.  Both  mMRC  and  CAT  are  available  from  Global  Strategy  for 
the Diagnosis, Management and Prevention of COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic 
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017. (Reproduced with permission from Global

three principal pharmacologic approaches to the problem: nicotine 
replacement therapy available as gum, transdermal patch, lozenge, 
inhaler,  and  nasal  spray;  bupropion;  and  varenicline,  a  nicotinic 
acid  receptor  agonist/antagonist.  Current  recommendations  from 
the U.S. Surgeon General are that all adult, nonpregnant smokers 
considering quitting be offered pharmacotherapy, in the absence of 
any  contraindication  to  treatment.  Smoking  cessation  counseling 
is also recommended and free counseling is available through state 
Smoking QuitLines. 
Bronchodilators 
In  general,  bronchodilators  are  the  primary 
treatment  for  almost  all  patients  with  COPD  and  are  used  for 
symptomatic  benefit  and  to  reduce  exacerbations.  The  inhaled 
route  is  preferred  for  medication  delivery,  because  side  effects 
are  less  than  with  systemic  medication  delivery.  In  symptomatic 
patients,  both  regularly  scheduled  use  of  long-acting  agents  and 
as-needed  short-acting  medications  are  indicated.  Figure  292-6 
provides  suggestions  for  prescribing  inhaled  medication  therapy 
based  on  grouping  patients  by  severity  of  symptoms  and  risk  of 
exacerbations. 
Muscarinic  Antagonists  Short-acting 
ipratropium  bromide 
improves symptoms with acute improvement in FEV1. Long-acting 
muscarinic antagonists (LAMA, including aclidinium, glycopyrro-
late, glycopyrronium, revefenacin, tiotropium, and umeclidinium) 
improve  symptoms  and  reduce  exacerbations.  In  a  large  random-
ized clinical trial, there was a trend toward reduced mortality rate in 
tiotropium-treated patients that approached statistical significance. 
Side effects are minor; dry mouth is the most frequent side effect. 
Beta  Agonists  Short-acting  beta  agonists  ease  symptoms  with 
acute  improvements  in  lung  function.  Long-acting  beta  agonists 
(LABAs)  provide  symptomatic  benefit  and  reduce  exacerbations, 
though  to  a  lesser  extent  than  an  LAMA.  Currently  available 
long-acting  inhaled  beta  agonists  are  arformoterol,  formoterol, 
indacaterol,  olodaterol,  salmeterol,  and  vilanterol.  The  main  side 
effects are tremor and tachycardia. 
Combinations of Beta Agonist–Muscarinic Antagonist  The com-
bination  inhaled  long-acting  beta  agonist  and  muscarinic  antag-
onist  therapy  has  been  demonstrated  to  provide  improvement  in

erbations. In population studies, patients with an eosinophil count 
of <100 cells per microliter do not benefit, while benefit increases 
as  eosinophil  counts  rise  above  100.  ICS  are  never  used  alone  in 
COPD due to little symptomatic benefit but, rather, are combined 
with a LABA or used with a LABA and LAMA. Their use has been 
associated  with  increased  rates  of  oropharyngeal  candidiasis  and 
pneumonia and in some studies an increased rate of loss of bone 
density  and  development  of  cataracts.  A  trial  of  ICS  should  be 

considered in patients with frequent exacerbations, defined as two 
or more per year or in patients hospitalized with one exacerbation. 
In  stable  patients  without  exacerbations,  ICS  withdrawal  may  be 
considered.  Patients  who  continue  to  smoke  cigarettes  do  not 
benefit as greatly from ICS use. Although ICS withdrawal does not 
lead to an increase in exacerbations, there may be a small decline 
in lung function. 
Oral Glucocorticoids  The chronic use of oral glucocorticoids for 
treatment of COPD is not recommended because of an unfavorable 
benefit/risk ratio. The chronic use of oral glucocorticoids is asso-
ciated  with  significant  side  effects,  including  osteoporosis,  weight

gain, cataracts, glucose intolerance, and increased risk of infection. 
A  study  demonstrated  that  patients  tapered  off  chronic  low-dose 
prednisone  (~10  mg/d)  did  not  experience  any  adverse  effect  on 
the  frequency  of  exacerbations,  health-related  quality  of  life,  or 
lung function. 
Theophylline  Theophylline  produces  modest  improvements  in 
airflow  and  vital  capacity,  but  is  not  first-line  therapy  due  to  side 
effects  and  drug  interactions.  Nausea  is  a  common  side  effect; 
tachycardia  and  tremor  have  also  been  reported.  Monitoring  of 
blood theophylline levels is required to minimize toxicity. 
PDE4 Inhibitors  The selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhib-
itor  roflumilast  has  been  demonstrated  to  reduce  exacerbation 
frequency in patients with severe COPD, chronic bronchitis, and a 
prior history of exacerbations; its effects on airflow obstruction and 
symptoms are modest, and side effects (including nausea, diarrhea, 
and weight loss) are common. 
Antibiotics  There are strong data implicating bacterial infection 
as  a  precipitant  of  a  substantial  portion  of  exacerbations.  A  ran-
domized  clinical  trial  of  azithromycin,  chosen  for  both  its  anti- 
inflammatory  and  antimicrobial  properties,  administered  daily 
to  subjects  with  a  history  of  exacerbation  in  the  past  6  months 
demonstrated  a  reduced  exacerbation  frequency  and  longer  time 
to first exacerbation in the macrolide-treated cohort (hazard ratio, 
0.73). Azithromycin was most effective in older patients and milder 
GOLD stages; there was little benefit in current smokers. 
Oxygen  Supplemental  O2  is  the  only  pharmacologic  therapy 
demonstrated to unequivocally decrease mortality in patients with 
COPD. For patients with resting hypoxemia (resting O2 saturation 
≤88%  in  any  patient  or  ≤89%  with  signs  of  pulmonary  arterial 
hypertension,  right  heart  failure  or  erythrocytosis),  the  use  of  O2 
has  been  demonstrated  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  mortality. 
Patients  meeting  these  criteria  should  be  on  continuous  oxygen 
supplementation  because  the  mortality  benefit  is  proportional 
to  the  number  of  hours  per  day  oxygen  is  used.  Various  delivery 
systems are available, including portable systems that patients may 
carry to allow mobility outside the home.

A recent study failed to demonstrate mortality benefits to COPD 
patients with moderate hypoxemia at rest or with hypoxemia only 
with activity. 
`1AT  Augmentation  Therapy  Specific  treatment  in  the  form  of  IV   
α1AT augmentation therapy is available for individuals with severe 
α1AT  deficiency.  Despite  sterilization  procedures  for  these  blood- 
derived products and the absence of reported cases of viral infection 
from  therapy,  some  physicians  recommend  hepatitis  B  vaccina-
tion  prior  to  starting  augmentation  therapy.  Although  biochem-
ical  efficacy  of  α1AT  augmentation  therapy  has  been  shown, 
the  benefits  of  α1AT  augmentation  therapy  are  controversial.  A 
randomized  study  suggested  a  reduction  in  emphysema  progres-
sion  in  patients  receiving  α1AT  augmentation  therapy.  Eligibility 
for  α1AT  augmentation  therapy  requires  a  serum  α1AT  level   
<11  μM  (~50  mg/dL).  Typically,  PiZ  individuals  will  qualify, 
although  other  rare  types  associated  with  severe  deficiency  (e.g., 
null-null)  are  also  eligible.  Because  only  a  fraction  of  individuals 
with severe α1AT deficiency will develop COPD, α1AT augmenta-
tion therapy is not recommended for severely α1AT-deficient per-
sons with normal pulmonary function and a normal chest CT scan. 
NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES
Patients with COPD should receive the influenza vaccine annually. 
Pneumococcal vaccines and vaccination for Bordetella pertussis are 
recommended. 
Pulmonary  Rehabilitation  This  refers  to  a  comprehensive  treat-
ment program that incorporates exercise, education, and psychoso-
cial and nutritional counseling. In COPD, pulmonary rehabilitation 
has  been  demonstrated  to  improve  health-related  quality  of  life, 
dyspnea,  and  exercise  capacity.  It  has  also  been  shown  to  reduce 
rates of hospitalization over a 6- to 12-month period. 

Lung Volume Reduction Surgery 
In carefully selected patients with 
emphysema, surgery to remove the most emphysematous portions 
of lung improves exercise capacity, lung function, and survival. The 
anatomic  distribution  of  emphysema  and  postrehabilitation  exer-
cise capacity are important prognostic characteristics. Patients with 
upper lobe–predominant emphysema and a low postrehabilitation 
exercise capacity are most likely to benefit from LVRS.

Patients  with  an  FEV1  <20%  of  predicted  and  either  diffusely 
distributed  emphysema  on  CT  scan  or  diffusing  capacity  of  lung 
for  carbon  monoxide  (DlCO)  <20%  of  predicted  have  increased 
mortality after the procedure, and thus are not candidates for LVRS.
Methods of achieving lung volume reduction by using broncho-
scopic  techniques  have  recently  been  approved  by  the  U.S.  Food 
and Drug Administration; they appear to be beneficial in selected 
emphysema patients. 
Lung Transplantation (See also Chap. 298)  COPD is currently the 
second  leading  indication  for  lung  transplantation.  Current  rec-
ommendations are that candidates for lung transplantation should 
have very severe airflow obstruction, severe disability despite maxi-
mal medical therapy, and be free of significant comorbid conditions 
such as liver, renal, or cardiac disease. 
EXACERBATIONS OF COPD
Exacerbations  are  a  prominent  feature  of  the  natural  history  of 
COPD. Exacerbations are episodic acute worsening of respiratory 
symptoms,  including  increased  dyspnea,  cough,  wheezing,  and/
or  change  in  the  amount  and  character  of  sputum.  They  may  or 
may not be accompanied by other signs of illness, including fever, 
myalgias,  and  sore  throat.  The  strongest  single  predictor  of  exac-
erbations  is  a  history  of  a  previous  exacerbation.  The  frequency 
of exacerbations increases as airflow obstruction worsens; patients 
with severe (FEV1 <50% predicted) or very severe airflow obstruc-
tion (FEV1 <30% predicted) on average have 1–3 episodes per year. 
However, some individuals with very severe airflow obstruction do 
not have frequent exacerbations. Other factors, such as an elevated 
ratio of the diameter of the pulmonary artery to aorta on chest CT 
and gastroesophageal reflux, are also associated with increased risk 
of COPD exacerbations. Economic analyses have shown that >70% 
of  COPD-related  health  care  expenditures  are  due  to  emergency 
department  visits  and  hospital  care  for  COPD  exacerbations;  this 
translates to over $10 billion annually in the United States. 
Precipitating  Causes  and  Strategies  to  Reduce  Frequency  of   
Exacerbations  A  variety  of  stimuli  may  result  in  the  final  com-
mon  pathway  of  airway  inflammation  and  increased  respiratory 
symptoms  that  are  characteristic  of  COPD  exacerbations.  Studies 
suggest  that  acquiring  a  new  strain  of  bacteria  is  associated  with 
increased near-term risk of exacerbation and that bacterial infection/ 
superinfection  is  involved  in  >50%  of  exacerbations.  Viral  respi-
ratory infections are present in approximately one-third of COPD 
exacerbations. In a significant minority of instances (20–35%), no 
specific precipitant can be identified. 
Patient Assessment  An attempt should be made to establish the 
severity  of  the  exacerbation  as  well  as  the  severity  of  preexisting 
COPD. The more severe either of these two components, the more 
likely that the patient will require hospital admission. The history 
should include quantification of the degree and change in dyspnea 
by asking about breathlessness during activities of daily living and 
typical activities for the patient. The patient should be asked about 
fever;  change  in  character  of  sputum;  and  associated  symptoms 
such as wheezing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, and chills. 
Inquiring about the frequency and severity of prior exacerbations 
can  provide  important  information;  the  single  greatest  risk  factor 
for  hospitalization  with  an  exacerbation  is  a  history  of  previous 
hospitalization.

The physical examination should incorporate an assessment of 
the  degree  of  distress  of  the  patient.  Specific  attention  should  be 
focused on tachycardia, tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, signs 
of perioral or peripheral cyanosis, the ability to speak in complete

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemsentences,  and  the  patient’s  mental  status.  The  chest  examination 
should establish the presence or absence of focal findings, degree of 
air movement, presence or absence of wheezing, asymmetry in the 
chest  examination  (suggesting  large  airway  obstruction  or  pneu-
mothorax mimicking an exacerbation), and the presence or absence 
of paradoxical motion of the abdominal wall.

Patients  with  severe  underlying  COPD,  who  are  in  moderate 
or severe distress, or those with focal findings should have a chest 
x-ray or chest CT scan. Approximately 25% of x-rays in this clinical 
situation will be abnormal, with the most frequent findings being 
pneumonia  and  congestive  heart  failure.  Patients  with  advanced 
COPD, a history of hypercarbia, or mental status changes (confu-
sion, sleepiness) or those in significant distress should have an arte-
rial blood gas measurement. The presence of hypercarbia, defined 
as  a  Pco2  >45  mmHg,  has  important  implications  for  treatment 
(discussed  below).  In  contrast  to  its  utility  in  the  management  of 
exacerbations of asthma, measurement of pulmonary function has 
not been demonstrated to be helpful in the diagnosis or manage-
ment of exacerbations of COPD. Pulmonary embolus (PE) should 
also  be  considered,  as  the  incidence  of  PE  is  increased  in  COPD 
exacerbations.

The need for inpatient treatment of exacerbations is suggested by 
the presence of respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia, new or wors-
ening hypoxemia, severe underlying disease, and those whose living 
situation is not conducive to careful observation and the delivery of 
prescribed treatment. 

TREATMENT OF ACUTE EXACERBATIONS 
Bronchodilators  Typically, patients are treated with inhaled beta 
agonists  and  muscarinic  antagonists.  These  may  be  administered 
separately or together, and the frequency of administration depends 
on the severity of the exacerbation. Patients are often treated initially 
with nebulized therapy, as such treatment is often easier to adminis-
ter in those in respiratory distress. It has been shown, however, that 
conversion to metered-dose inhalers is effective when accompanied 
by education and training of patients and staff. This approach has 
significant  economic  benefits  and  also  allows  an  easier  transition 
to outpatient care. The addition of methylxanthines (theophylline) 
to  this  regimen  can  be  considered,  although  convincing  proof  of 
its  efficacy  is  lacking.  If  methylxanthines  are  added,  serum  levels 
should be monitored in an attempt to minimize toxicity. 
Antibiotics  Patients  with  COPD  are  frequently  colonized  with 
potential respiratory pathogens, and it is often difficult to identify 
conclusively a specific species of bacteria responsible for a particu-
lar clinical event. Bacteria frequently implicated in COPD exacer-
bations include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, 
Moraxella catarrhalis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae; viral pathogens 
are also common etiologies of exacerbations. The choice of antibi-
otic should be based on local patterns of antibiotic susceptibility of 
the above bacterial pathogens as well as the patient’s clinical con-
dition. Patients with moderate or severe exacerbations are usually 
treated with antibiotics, even in the absence of data implicating a 
specific pathogen.

In patients admitted to the hospital, the use of systemic glucocor-
ticoids reduces the length of stay, hastens recovery, and reduces the 
chance  of  subsequent  exacerbation  or  relapse.  One  study  demon-
strated  that  2  weeks  of  glucocorticoid  therapy  produced  benefit 
indistinguishable from 8 weeks of therapy. Current recommendations 
suggest 30–40 mg of oral prednisolone or its equivalent typically for 
a period of 5–10 days in outpatients. Hyperglycemia, particularly in 
patients with preexisting diagnosis of diabetes, is the most frequently 
reported acute complication of glucocorticoid treatment. 
Oxygen  Supplemental  O2  should  be  supplied  to  maintain  oxy-
gen  saturation  ≥90%.  Studies  have  demonstrated  that  in  patients 
with  both  acute  and  chronic  hypercarbia,  the  administration  of 
supplemental  O2  does  not  reduce  minute  ventilation.  It  does,  in 
some  patients,  result  in  modest  increases  in  arterial  Pco2,  chiefly 
by altering ventilation-perfusion relationships within the lung. This 

should not deter practitioners from providing the oxygen needed to 
correct hypoxemia. 
Mechanical  Ventilatory  Support  The  initiation  of  noninvasive 
positive-pressure  ventilation  (NIPPV)  in  patients  with  respira-
tory  failure,  defined  as  Paco2  >45  mmHg,  results  in  a  significant 
reduction  in  mortality  rate,  need  for  intubation,  complications  of 
therapy,  and  hospital  length  of  stay.  Contraindications  to  NIPPV 
include cardiovascular instability, impaired mental status, inability 
to cooperate, copious secretions or the inability to clear secretions, 
craniofacial abnormalities or trauma precluding effective fitting of 
mask, extreme obesity, or significant burns.

Invasive  (conventional)  mechanical  ventilation  via  an  endotra-
cheal tube is indicated for patients with severe respiratory distress 
despite initial therapy, life-threatening hypoxemia, severe hypercar-
bia  and/or  acidosis,  markedly  impaired  mental  status,  respiratory 
arrest, hemodynamic instability, or other complications. The goal of 
mechanical ventilation is to correct the aforementioned conditions. 
Factors to consider during mechanical ventilatory support include 
the  need  to  provide  sufficient  expiratory  time  in  patients  with 
severe airflow obstruction and the presence of auto-PEEP (positive 
end-expiratory  pressure),  which  can  result  in  patients  having  to 
generate  significant  respiratory  effort  to  trigger  a  breath  during  a 
demand mode of ventilation. The mortality rate of patients requir-
ing  mechanical  ventilatory  support  is  17–30%  for  that  particular 
hospitalization. For patients aged >65 admitted to the intensive care 
unit for treatment, the mortality rate doubles over the next year to 
60%, regardless of whether mechanical ventilation was required.

Following a hospitalization for COPD, about 20% of patients are 
rehospitalized in the subsequent 30 days and 45% are hospitalized 
in the next year. Mortality following hospital discharge is about 20% 
in the following year.

293 Interstitial Lung Disease

Gary M. Hunninghake, Ivan O. Rosas

Diffuse  parenchymal  lung  diseases  include  a  large  number  (>200)  of 
heterogeneous conditions that affect the lung parenchyma with varying 
degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. While remodeling of the intersti-
tial space, the region between the epithelium and endothelium, tends 
to be the dominant site of involvement for most of the interstitial lung 
diseases (ILDs), it is important to recognize the prominent role of the 
alveolar epithelium and endothelial cells (including both airways and 
vessels) in the pathogenesis of these ILDs.

Despite  the  diverse  array  of  conditions,  most  patients  ultimately 
diagnosed  with  an  ILD  will  come  to  medical  attention  with  reports 
of progressive exertional dyspnea or a persistent dry cough. However, 
because  some  ILDs  are  part  of  multisystem  disorders,  some  patients 
will be identified based on nonrespiratory symptomatology (e.g., skin 
thickening in the setting of systemic sclerosis, Chap. 359) or physical 
examination findings (e.g., ulnar deviation of the fingers in the setting 
of rheumatoid arthritis [RA], Chap. 358). Additionally, ILDs can also 
be identified incidentally based on the results of abnormal pulmonary 
function tests, chest x-rays (CXRs), computed tomography (CT) stud-
ies of both the chest and abdomen (which can both visualize, at least a 
portion, of the lung parenchyma), and positron emission tomography 
(PET) scans. It is important to remember that ILDs can be associated 
with  high  rates  of  morbidity  and  mortality,  and  although  prognosis 
depends on both disease extent and specificity, this fact makes these 
important disorders to recognize in a timely manner.

Owing to a variety of clinical presentations, as well as overlapping 
imaging  and  histopathologic  findings  (Table  293-1),  ILDs  can  be 
difficult to diagnose. A generally accepted central tenet of ILD diag-
nosis is that the combined weight of clinical data, laboratory studies, 

pulmonary function testing, imaging findings, and histopathology (if 
obtained) are jointly required to make a confident diagnosis. No single 
piece  of  data  confers  a  diagnosis  alone.  For  example,  a  lung  biopsy 
demonstrating a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern is helpful 
in  diagnosing  a  patient  with  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  (IPF)  but 
can  also  be  present  in  some  connective  tissue  diseases  (CTDs)  (e.g., 
RA-associated  ILD,  Chap.  358).  In  light  of  this  challenge,  most  ILD 
centers recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis (and 
in some cases the management) of ILDs. An example of a multidisci-
plinary approach might include a conference attended by pulmonolo-
gists,  rheumatologists,  radiologists,  and  pathologists  where  all  of  the 
data generated on a patient can be discussed and reviewed jointly by 
those with unique sets of expertise in the care of patients with ILD.

While there are numerous ways to categorize the ILDs, one classic 
approach  is  to  divide  the  ILDs  into  those  of  known  and  unknown 
causes (Fig. 293-1). Although even this approach has limitations (e.g., 
genetic studies demonstrate that a significant portion of familial pul-
monary fibrosis and IPF [classically described as diseases of unknown 
cause] may be explained, in part, by genetic factors), it is a useful place 
to  start.  Known  causes  of  ILD  include  occupational  exposures  (e.g., 
asbestosis), medications (e.g., nitrofurantoin), and those related to an 
underlying  systemic  disease  (e.g.,  cryptogenic  organizing  pneumonia 
[COP] in the setting of polymyositis). Unknown causes of ILD include 
groups of rare disorders often with classic presentations (e.g., a sponta-
neous pneumothorax in a young female with diffuse cystic changes on 
a chest CT might suggest lymphangioleiomyomatosis [LAM]) and the 
most  common  group  of  ILDs,  the  idiopathic  interstitial  pneumonias 
(IIPs). Granulomatous lung diseases straddle both known (e.g., hyper-
sensitivity pneumonitis [HP] due to chronic bird exposure, Chap. 288) 
and unknown (e.g., sarcoidosis, Chap. 367) causes and are often sepa-
rated due to their unique presentations, imaging findings, and diagnos-
tic evaluation. Equally important to knowledge of disease classification 
is knowledge of disease prevalence. Although there is variability within 
different  demographic  groups,  most  studies  demonstrate  that  IPF,

FIGURE 293-1  Classification of interstitial lung disease. This algorithm represents a common approach to subclassifying the interstitial lung diseases. It is typical to divide 
the interstitial lung diseases into those of known and unknown causes (although it is important to note that genetic studies demonstrate that a significant portion of familial 
and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [classically described as diseases of unknown cause] may be explained, in part, by genetic factors). The idiopathic interstitial pneumonias 
were more precisely defined by a 2002 study as described in Am J Respir Crit Care Med 165:277, 2002, referenced in the Further Reading list.

sarcoidosis (Chap. 367), and ILDs related to CTDs (Chap. 413) as a 
group are among the most common forms of ILD.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH
The initial diagnostic approach to diffuse parenchymal lung disease is 
often broader than a focus on ILD and should include an evaluation 
for alternate causes including cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, 
Chap.  258),  diffuse  infections  (e.g.,  pneumocystis  pneumonia,  Chap. 
220), and malignancy (e.g., bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, Chap. 315 
in HPIM 19e). This chapter will focus on the diagnostic evaluation that 
helps to distinguish among the various forms of ILD.

 ■ HISTORY
Age  Age at presentation has a strong influence on the pretest prob-
ability that IPF, in particular, is present. For example, IPF occurs most 
commonly in patients aged >60 and is quite rare among patients aged 
<50. In fact, in patients aged >65 without strong evidence for an alter-
nate diagnosis, atypical chest CT findings are still more likely to result 
in a histopathologic diagnosis of UIP (a pathologic hallmark of IPF) 
than  they  are  to  result  in  an  alternate  IIP  diagnosis.  Other  common 
ILDs, such as sarcoidosis and CTD-associated ILD, and less common 
ILDs,  such  as  LAM  and  pulmonary  Langerhans  cell  histiocytosis 
(PLCH), tend to present between the ages of 20 and 40.

Sex  Although  less  influential  than  age,  sex  has  some  influence  on 
likelihood  of  various  ILDs.  LAM  (and  the  related  disorder  tuberous 
sclerosis)  (see  Chap.  315  in  HPIM  19e)  is  a  disorder  that  is  fre-
quently diagnosed in young women. Many CTD-associated ILDs are 
more  common  among  women,  with  the  exception  of  RA-associated 
ILD,  which  is  more  common  among  men.  IPF  and  occupational/ 
exposure-related ILDs (likely due to work-related exposures that tend 
to differ between men and women) are more common among men.

Duration  of  Symptoms  Acute  presentations  (days  to  weeks)  of 
ILD  are  unusual  and  are  commonly  misdiagnosed  as  more  common 
diseases such as pneumonia, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 

(COPD) exacerbation, or heart failure. ILDs that can present acutely 
include  eosinophilic  pneumonia,  acute  interstitial  pneumonia  (AIP), 
HP,  and  granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis  (GPA).  An  acute  exacer-
bation  of  IPF  as  the  initial  presentation  of  this  disease  should  also 
be  a  consideration  given  its  prevalence.  ILDs  most  commonly  have 
a  chronic  indolent  presentation  (months  to  years)  typified  by  IPF. 
However, subacute presentations (weeks to months) can occur in most 
of the ILDs, but in the right context could suggest sarcoidosis, CTD- 
associated ILD, drug-induced ILD, or COP.

Respiratory  Symptoms  Progressive  dyspnea,  most  frequently 
noted  with  exertion,  is  the  most  common  complaint  in  patients  pre-
senting with an ILD. Despite this fact, both research studies of general 
population  samples  and  clinical  experiences  of  asymptomatic  patient 
referrals with abnormal chest CT imaging patterns have also demon-
strated that some patients, even those with more extensive disease, may 
not report dyspnea. Cough, particularly a dry cough, is also common 
and can be the most prominent symptom in patients with IPF. Cough 
is often reported in other ILDs, particularly those that have prominent 
airway involvement including sarcoidosis and HP. Cough with hemop-
tysis is rare and could suggest an ILD associated with diffuse alveolar 
hemorrhage  (DAH)  (e.g.,  Goodpasture’s  syndrome),  GPA,  or  LAM. 
Cough  with  hemoptysis  could  also  suggest  a  secondary  pulmonary 
infection that can be seen in patients with traction bronchiectasis and 
in  those  receiving  immunosuppressive  therapy.  Chest  pain  is  rare  in 
most of the ILDs with the exception of sarcoidosis where chest discom-
fort is not uncommon. Fatigue is common to all of the ILDs.

Past  Medical  History  The  most  pertinent  history  includes  a 
personal history of a CTD or a history of symptoms commonly asso-
ciated with a CTD (e.g., Raynaud’s phenomena). It is also important to 
remember that ILD associated with a CTD can be the initial presenting 
symptom of the disease and can precede the development of additional 
symptomatology by many years. A history of malignancy is important 
because  some  malignancies  can  be  associated  with  dermatomyositis- 
associated  COP  and  sarcoid-like  reactions.  A  history  of  asthma  and 
allergic rhinitis might suggest a diagnosis of eosinophilic GPA.

2192 Medications  Many  medications  have  been  associated  with  ILD, 
and  to  complicate  matters  further,  many  medications  commonly 
used  to  treat  inflammatory  and  granulomatous  lung  disease  are  also 
associated  with  ILD  development  (e.g.,  methotrexate,  azathioprine, 
rituximab, and the tumor necrosis factor α–blocking agents). Specific 
medications  in  many  classes  are  also  known  to  cause  ILD,  including 
antibiotics  (e.g.,  nitrofurantoin),  antiarrhythmics  (e.g.,  amiodarone), 
and many of the antineoplastic agents (e.g., bleomycin).

Family  History  A  family  history  of  ILD  (of  almost  any  type)  is 
important  to  ascertain.  The  percentage  of  pulmonary  fibrosis  that  is 
familial, as opposed to idiopathic, varies by study, with estimates rang-
ing  from  <5%  to  as  high  as  20%.  Despite  this  variability,  most  agree 
that the presence of a close relative with an IIP is among the strongest 
risk  factors  for  IPF.  Family  studies  have  consistently  noted  familial 
aggregation of diverse forms of IIP (such as IPF, nonspecific interstitial 
pneumonia [NSIP], and DIP running in the same family) and, in some 
cases,  other  forms  of  ILD.  To  date,  the  most  well-replicated  genetic 
factors  for  pulmonary  fibrosis  (a  promoter  variant  of  a  mucin  gene 
[MUC5B]) and various genetic determinants known to influence telo-
mere length (e.g., variants in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene 
[TERT])  (Chap.  482)  appear  to  be  associated  with  both  familial  and 
idiopathic forms of pulmonary fibrosis similarly.

Social  History  A  history  of  smoking  is  nearly  always  present  in 
some  forms  of  ILD  (e.g.,  respiratory  bronchiolitis  and  desquamative 
interstitial  pneumonia  [DIP]—sometimes  referred  by  pathologists 
jointly as smoking-related ILD) where it is felt to be causative. A his-
tory of smoking is also noted in approximately three-quarters of IPF 
patients. Occupational and environmental exposure histories are also 
important to obtain as they might identify exposures known to cause 
pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., significant asbestos exposure) or HP (pigeon 
breeder’s lung).

 ■ PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
End-inspiratory  fine  crackles,  or  rales,  noted  at  the  lung  bases  are 
found in most patients with IPF and may be one of the earliest signs of 
the disease. However, rales are nonspecific and can be found in many 
forms  of  ILD  and  other  disorders.  Wheezing  is  uncommon  in  most 
forms of ILD but can be present in some disorders, such as sarcoidosis, 
HP, and eosinophilic GPA. Signs of advanced disease include cyanosis, 
digital clubbing, and cor pulmonale.

 ■ LABORATORY STUDIES
Laboratory  studies  can  be  particularly  helpful  in  the  workup  for  an 
underlying CTD-associated ILD. As noted previously, these tests can 
reveal the presence of an underlying CTD as the cause of an ILD (e.g., 
a positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP] antibody for RA) 
even when no other symptomatology or physical examination findings 
suggestive of the disorder are present. However, the cost-effectiveness 
and the extent of laboratory testing that should be ordered in various 
clinical contexts have yet to be determined (as there is a relatively long 
list of autoantibody tests that could be ordered).

 ■ PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS
Most forms of ILD will eventually result in a restrictive deficit on pul-
monary  function  testing.  A  restrictive  deficit  is  typified  by  a  reduced 
total  lung  capacity  (TLC)  and  symmetrically  reduced  measures  of 
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). 
A reduction in the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide 
(DlCO) is also common and may precede a reduction in lung volumes; 
however, there is more measurement variability in DlCO measurement 
and the test is less specific for ILD. A reduced FEV1 to FVC ratio, which 
is diagnostic of airway obstruction, is unusual in many forms of ILD but 
can be present as an isolated finding or in conjunction with an additional 
restrictive deficit in ILDs involving the airways such as sarcoidosis, HP, 
and  LAM.  Although  pulmonary  function  testing  is  rarely  diagnostic, 
reductions in lung function help to characterize the extent of disease, 
and evidence for decline in repeated measures of pulmonary function 
(e.g., FVC) has been correlated with an elevated rate of mortality.

 ■ CHEST IMAGING STUDIES
Chest X-Ray  Findings on CXR can be the first clinical indication 
that an ILD might be present. For example, enlarged hilar lymph nodes 
and  a  pattern  of  central  nodular  opacities  in  the  mid  to  upper  lung 
zones  can  suggest  sarcoidosis.  A  basilar  reticular  pattern,  with  small 
cystic spaces, in the absence of clinical evidence for heart failure, might 
suggest IPF. With a few exceptions, CXR alone rarely leads to a specific 
diagnosis.

Chest CT  High-resolution CT (HRCT) chest imaging is now con-
sidered to be standard of care in the initial evaluation of a patient with 
a suspected ILD. HRCT can be diagnostic for some ILDs (e.g., IPF) in 
the right clinical context and may preclude the need for, and spare the 
patient the risk of, a lung biopsy. HRCT also helps to define the extent 
of the ILD, determine the presence of more concerning features sug-
gestive of advanced disease (e.g., honeycombing), provide information 
on coexisting diseases (e.g., emphysema and lung cancer), and when 
not  diagnostic,  provide  the  most  useful  locations  for  obtaining  lung 
biopsy specimens.

 ■ LUNG BIOPSY
Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy  Bronchoscopy can be helpful in estab-
lishing a specific ILD diagnosis, and can help to establish an alternate 
diagnosis,  in  select  cases.  Examination  of  serial  lavage  fluid  can  be 
helpful  in  establishing  DAH,  which  can  be  present  in  ILDs  with 
vasculitis  (e.g.,  GPA),  and  in  some  cases,  cellular  examination  can 
suggest a specific diagnosis (eosinophilia >25% in chronic eosinophilic 
pneumonia  or  fat  globules  in  macrophages  in  lipoid  pneumonia). 
Transbronchial lung biopsies and lymph node biopsies (in sarcoidosis 
in particular) can lead to a confident diagnosis in patients with likely 
granulomatous  lung  disease  (e.g.,  sarcoidosis  and  HP).  However,  in 
general, bronchoscopically obtained tissue samples are often felt to be 
insufficient  to  diagnose  most  of  the  IIPs.  To  date,  studies  have  been 
mixed on whether bronchoscopically obtained cryobiopsies, which can 
result  in  yields  larger  than  those  obtained  by  transbronchial  forceps 
biopsies, could improve the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy; however, 
the precise role of cryobiopsies in the diagnostic workup of ILD has yet 
to be clarified.

Surgical Lung Biopsy  A surgically obtained lung biopsy specimen 
can  help  solidify  the  diagnosis  of  ILD.  In  many  cases,  these  are  now 
obtained through a video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) approach (as 
compared to an open thoracotomy), which tends to reduce the length 
of operative times and hospital stays. The diagnostic yield of biopsies 
tends to be higher if obtained prior to treatment. The desire to obtain 
a surgical lung biopsy should be weighed against the risks, which can 
include a short-term mortality rate of as high as 5%. These risks are 
reported to be higher in biopsies of patients ultimately diagnosed with 
IPF and in those presenting acutely.

 ■ INDIVIDUAL FORMS OF ILD
The ILDs include a diverse group of lung pathologies that can be sub-
classified into those disorders of unknown cause (e.g., IIPs) and those 
of  known  cause  (e.g.,  sometimes  referred  to  as  secondary  interstitial 
pneumonias  [CTD-associated  ILDs])  (see  Fig.  293-1).  Although  this 
remains a useful approach to classifying this diverse group of disorders, 
it  is  important  to  recognize  that  genetic  studies  are  challenging  this 
classic categorization. For example, numerous ILDs commonly listed as 
having an “unknown cause” have been determined to have significant 
genetic underpinnings (e.g., IPF and LAM), while the pathophysiologic 
processes  that  result  in  ILDs  of  “known  cause”  (e.g.,  CTD)  remain 
incompletely understood. Diagnosis is based on combined information 
obtained  from  a  patient’s  clinical  presentation,  measures  of  pulmo-
nary  function,  imaging,  immune  serologies,  and  histopathology.  It  is 
important to remember that prognosis and treatment vary widely by 
disorder (and disease extent). In some cases, medical therapy that is felt 
to be effective for some ILDs has been proven to be harmful for others. 
Medical  treatments  range  from  immune  modulators  to  antifibrotic

for patients with advanced and rapidly progressive ILDs.

IDIOPATHIC INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIAS
 ■ IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS
Clinical  Manifestations 
IPF  is  the  most  common  ILD  of 
unknown  cause.  Prevalence  increases  with  age  and  is  estimated  at 
50–200:100,000.  IPF  is  commonly  diagnosed  in  the  fifth  or  sixth 
decade in life, affects men more than women, and is frequently associ-
ated with a history of smoking or other environmental exposures. IPF 
is a variably progressive disease that carries a poor prognosis with an 
estimated 50% 3- to 5-year survival.

HRCT  Image  Findings  Chest  CT  findings  include  subpleural 
reticulation  with  a  posterior  basal  predominance  usually  including 
more  advanced  fibrotic  features,  such  as  honeycombing  and  traction 
bronchiectasis.  Collectively,  these  imaging  findings  are  referred  to  as 
a UIP pattern. The presence of extensive ground-glass opacities, bron-
chovascular  changes,  micronodules,  mosaic  attenuation,  or  an  upper 
lung predominance should raise suspicion for an alternative diagnosis 
(Fig. 293-2).

Histopathology  Diagnostic  VATS  biopsy  findings  include  sub-
pleural reticulation associated with honeycomb changes and fibroblast 
foci  (subepithelial  collections  of  myofibroblasts  and  collagen).  These 

fibrotic changes alternate with areas of preserved normal alveolar archi-
tecture consistent with temporal and spatial heterogeneity (Fig. 293-3). 
Collectively, these pathologic findings are referred to as UIP.

2193

Treatment  Historically,  IPF  was  felt  to  be  refractory  to  medical 
therapy  with  lung  transplantation  the  only  viable  therapeutic  option. 
This  dogma  changed  in  2014  with  large  clinical  trials  that  demon-
strated that antifibrotic therapy (pirfenidone and nintedanib) can slow 
decline  of  lung  function  in  IPF  patients.  Further  meta-analyses  have 
suggested  that  antifibrotic  therapy  may  also  improve  survival.  Trials 
now suggest that antifibrotic therapy may be broadly effective in other 
forms of progressive pulmonary fibrosis as well. In contrast, treatment 
with  immunosuppression,  which  had  been  commonly  prescribed  to 
many IPF patients, has now been demonstrated (in some cases) to be 
associated  with  increased  morbidity  and  mortality.  Physical  therapy 
and  supplemental  oxygen,  when  indicated,  can  improve  exercise  tol-
erance and reduce likelihood of developing pulmonary hypertension. 
Lung  transplantation  can  extend  survival  and  improve  the  quality  of 
life in a subset of IPF patients who meet criteria to undergo transplant.
 ■ NONSPECIFIC INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA
Clinical  Manifestations 
Idiopathic  NSIP  is  a  distinct  clinical 
entity with characteristic clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features; 
however, NSIP is also commonly observed in patients with CTD and 
less frequently with familial interstitial pneumonia, drug toxicity, and 
infection. Although the prevalence of NSIP is not well established, it is

FIGURE 293-2  Chest CT imaging and interstitial lung disease. A. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF): Classic findings of IPF (apparent on this image) include a posterior, 
basilar  predominance  of  subpleural  reticular  markings  and  more  advanced  features  of  pulmonary  fibrosis  including  traction  bronchiectasis  and  honeycombing.  This 
constellation of findings is often referred to as a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern. B. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP): Chest CT findings of NSIP can 
overlap with those of a UIP pattern but tend to include a bilateral, symmetric pattern that presents with a greater percentage of ground-glass opacities than is apparent in 
a UIP pattern. Additional unique findings include more diffuse imaging abnormalities with a predominance not limited to the lung bases, imaging abnormalities that spare 
the subpleural regions, and thickening of the bronchovascular bundles (as is apparent in the right mid lung zone on this image). C. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia: 
Chest CT findings include patchy, sometimes migratory, subpleural consolidative opacities (as is apparent on this image) often with associated ground-glass opacities. 
Peribronchiolar or perilobar opacities can be present, and sometimes a rim of subpleural sparing (often referred to as a reversed halo or atoll sign) can be seen, which 
can help to aid in the diagnosis. D. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis can present with varied imaging abnormalities, but a pattern of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with a 
pattern of reticular-nodular opacities involving the bronchovascular bundles (apparent in this image) are common features. Additional findings can include diffuse small 
nodules in a miliary pattern, larger nodular opacities, extensive ground-glass infiltrates, and mosaic attenuation suggestive of small airways involvement, and, in more 
advanced cases, signs of pulmonary fibrosis.

FIGURE 293-3  Histopathology of interstitial lung disease. A. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF): Histopathologic findings include subpleural reticulation associated with 
honeycomb changes alternating with areas of preserved normal lung architecture referred to as temporal and spatial heterogeneity (as is apparent in the low-power 
image above). Additional important diagnostic findings include fibroblast foci, which are subepithelial collections of myofibroblasts and collagen (as is apparent in the 
higher-powered inset of this image). Collectively, these pathologic findings are referred to as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).  B. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia 
(NSIP):  Histopathologic  findings  of  NSIP  include  varying  amounts  of  interstitial  inflammation  and  fibrosis  with  a  uniform  appearance  (as  is  apparent  in  this  image). 
Honeycomb  changes  are  usually  absent  and  fibroblast  foci  are  rare.  NSIP  is  often  referred  to  histopathologically  as  being  either  predominantly  cellular  or  fibrotic.  
C.  Cryptogenic  organizing  pneumonia  (COP):  Histopathologic  findings  of  COP  include  patchy  regions  of  organizing  pneumonia  with  granulation  tissue  that  commonly 
involves the small airways, alveolar ducts, and alveoli with surrounding inflammation that can involve the alveolar walls (as is apparent in this image). D. Sarcoidosis: The 
hallmark histopathologic feature of sarcoidosis is presence of granulomas (as are apparent numerously in the low-powered image and more closely visualized in the higher-
powered inset image). Typically, these are referred to as noncaseating, which suggests the absence of necrosis. Caseating granulomas are rare in sarcoid and should 
prompt additional evaluation for an underlying infection. Because malignancy can result in a granulomatous reaction, it is important to closely survey biopsy specimens 
with granulomatous involvement for additional signs of malignancy.

commonly diagnosed in nonsmoking females in their fifth decade of 
life. Positive serologic tests for CTD are frequently observed. Idiopathic 
NSIP has a relatively good prognosis, with a 5-year survival of >80%; 
patients with a predominant cellular NSIP pattern have a more favor-
able prognosis than those with a fibrosing NSIP pattern.

HRCT  Image  Findings  Diffuse  subpleural,  symmetric,  ground-
glass,  and  reticular  opacities  are  common.  Volume  loss  and  traction 
bronchiectasis involving the lower lung zones can also be found. Occa-
sionally subpleural sparing is noted, while peribronchiolar thickening 
and honeycombing are uncommon.

Histopathology  Diagnostic  lung  biopsy  findings  include  varying 
amounts of interstitial inflammation and fibrosis with a uniform appear-
ance. Honeycomb changes are usually absent and fibroblast foci are rare. 
NSIP  is  often  referred  to  histopathologically  as  being  either  predom-
inantly  cellular  (and  potentially  more  responsive  to  medical  therapy) 
or fibrotic (and potentially less likely to resolve with medical therapy).

Treatment  Pulmonary fibrosis associated with CTD is commonly 
treated  with  immunosuppression  despite  the  paucity  of  randomized 
clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy. Idiopathic NSIP is often treated 
with  oral  steroids  (prednisone),  cytotoxic  agents  (mycophenolate, 
azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide), or biologics (rituximab). Trials 
now  suggest  that  NSIP  patients  with  progressive  pulmonary  fibrosis 
may  benefit  from  antifibrotic  therapy.  Oxygen  therapy,  pulmonary 
rehabilitation,  and  lung  transplantation  may  be  required  in  patients 
with progressive disease.

 ■ SMOKING-RELATED ILD
Although  smoking-related  ILDs,  including  respiratory  bronchiolitis 
with  interstitial  lung  disease  (RB-ILD),  and  DIP  are  frequently  sub-
classified with the IIPs, these disorders (along with PLCH, an ILD with 
unique clinical, imaging, and histopathologic manifestations) are com-
monly felt to be the result of active or prior tobacco smoke exposure. 
DIP has also been known to occur in children with familial pulmonary 
fibrosis (FPF). Smokers, particularly elderly smokers, frequently have 
radiologic  (centrilobular)  interstitial  abnormalities.  These  interstitial 
abnormalities  are  often  incidentally  found  on  routine  CXR  or  chest 
CT  studies  in  asymptomatic  or  minimally  symptomatic  individuals. 
Respiratory  bronchiolitis  is  felt  to  correlate  histopathologically  with 
these imaging findings. However, in some cases, these imaging findings 
can progress to more advanced radiologic changes where more diffuse 
signs of interstitial pneumonia tend to be present.
Clinical Manifestations  These disorders predominantly occur in 
active, and in many cases heavy, smokers who are typically between 40 
and 50 years of age. In those ultimately diagnosed with RB-ILD or DIP, 
dyspnea and cough are relatively common and symptomatic wheezing 
is not rare. The prevalence of smoking-related ILDs is not well under-
stood, but they are generally felt to account for <10% of the IIPs. While 
there are minimal data on the natural histories and prognoses of these 
conditions, prolonged survival can be expected in most patients with 
RB-ILD and death secondary to progressive ILD is felt to be rare.
HRCT  Image  Findings  Prominent  and  common  findings  in 
RB-ILD include central bronchial wall thickening, peripheral bronchial 

HPIM21e_Part7_p2131-p2216.indd   2194

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemwall  thickening,  centrilobular  nodules,  and  ground-glass  opacities. 
Septal  lines  and  a  reticular  pattern  are  also  not  uncommon.  Honey-
combing is generally felt to be rare (and indicates a worse prognosis). 
Similar  findings  are  noted  in  patients  with  DIP  where  diffuse  (or 
patchy)  bilateral  symmetric  ground-glass  opacities  tend  to  be  even 
more prominent.

Histopathology  Common  features  of  RB-ILD  include  the  accu-
mulation of pigmented macrophages within the lumens of respiratory 
bronchioles and alveolar ducts, accompanied by chronic inflammation 
of  the  respiratory  bronchiolar  walls  and  both  bronchiolar  and  peri-
bronchiolar  alveolar  fibrosis  causing  architectural  distortion.  These 
features  are  patchy  and  confined  to  the  peribronchiolar  region.  DIP 
tends to include similar changes but has a more diffuse pattern charac-
terized by pigmented macrophage accumulation, pneumocyte hyper-
plasia, and prominent interstitial thickening.

Treatment  All patients with smoking-related ILD should be coun-
seled to discontinue smoking and/or encouraged to enroll in a formal 
smoking cessation program. Small studies have evaluated, and patients 
are often treated with, immunosuppressive (e.g., prednisone) and cyto-
toxic (e.g., azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide) agents and, in some 
cases, bronchodilators. To date, there is no strong evidence that these 
therapies result in significant improvements in symptoms or measures 
of pulmonary function or prevent clinical deterioration.

 ■ CRYPTOGENIC ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA
Clinical Manifestations  COP typically involves patients in their 
50–60s  and  often  presents  as  a  subacute  flulike  illness,  with  cough, 
dyspnea,  fever,  and  fatigue.  Inspiratory  rales  are  often  present  on 
examination, and most patients are noted to have restrictive lung defi-
cits on pulmonary function testing with hypoxemia. COP is commonly 
mistaken for pneumonia. It is important to note that this syndrome can 
occur in isolation, can be secondary to an underlying CTD (e.g., poly-
myositis) or medications, or can result from an underlying malignancy. 
Laboratory testing for various CTDs is helpful as testing can both be 
diagnostic and suggest the need for prolonged medical therapy.

HRCT  Image  Findings  The  most  common  imaging  findings 
include  patchy,  sometimes  migratory,  subpleural  consolidative  opac-
ities  often  with  associated  ground-glass  opacities.  Peribronchiolar  or 
perilobar opacities can be present, and sometimes a rim of subpleural 
sparing (often referred to as a reversed halo or atoll sign) can be seen, 
which can aid in the diagnosis.

Histopathology  Surgical  lung  biopsy  specimens  tend  to  reveal 
patchy  regions  of  organizing  pneumonia  with  granulation  tissue  that 
commonly involves the small airways, alveolar ducts, and alveoli with 
surrounding  inflammation  that  can  involve  the  alveolar  walls  (see  
Fig. 293-3).

Treatment  Corticosteroids  can  result  in  substantial  clinical 
improvement in many patients but usually need to be continued for at 
least 6 months as relapse rates are high. Evidence is growing that alter-
nate  cytotoxic  (e.g.,  mycophenolate,  cyclophosphamide)  or  biologic 
(e.g., rituximab) therapies can be helpful in both treating the disease 
and  reducing  the  need  for  steroids.  In  some  patients  with  secondary 
forms of the disease, long-term therapy may be needed.

ACUTE OR SUBACUTE IIPS
 ■ ACUTE INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA  
(HAMMAN-RICH SYNDROME)
Clinical Manifestations  AIP is a rare and often fatal lung disor-
der that is characterized by an acute onset of respiratory distress and 
hypoxemia. A prodromal period of symptoms consistent with an acute 
upper  respiratory  infection  is  common.  The  mortality  rate  within  
6 months of presentation can be quite high (>50%), and recurrences 
are common. In those who recover, lung function improvement can be 
substantial. AIP can be difficult to distinguish from acute respiratory 

distress  syndrome  (ARDS)  and  an  acute  exacerbation  of  an  unsus-
pected underlying pulmonary fibrotic process.

2195

HRCT Image Findings  The most common imaging findings are 
patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities. Dependent regions of air-space 
consolidation are also common.

Histopathology  Similar  to  ARDS  and  acute  exacerbations  of 
underlying pulmonary fibrosis, AIP presents histopathologically as dif-
fuse alveolar damage (DAD) demonstrated on a surgical lung biopsy.

Treatment  Treatment  is  mostly  supportive  and  often  includes 
mechanical ventilation. There is no proven drug therapy for AIP. Glu-
cocorticoids are often given, but they are not clearly effective and data 
on their use in other forms of DAD (e.g., ARDS) is controversial.
 ■ ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF IIPS
Clinical  Manifestations  Acute  exacerbations  are  not  separate 
disorders,  but  rather  an  accelerated  phase  of  lung  injury  that  can 
occur  in  any  ILD  resulting  in  pulmonary  fibrosis.  Acute  exacerba-
tions are most commonly described and most severe in patients with 
known  IPF.  Acute  exacerbations  are  characterized  by  an  acute  onset  
(<30 days) of respiratory distress and hypoxemia occurring in a patient 
with underlying pulmonary fibrosis not explained by an alternate cause 
(e.g., pneumonia, left heart failure). Reported mortality rates are very 
high (>85%), and mean survival periods range from as little as days to 
months.

HRCT  Image  Findings  The  most  common  imaging  findings 
include patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities and dependent regions 
of  air-space  consolidation.  Sometimes  these  new  changes  can  be 
appreciated  on  the  background  of  the  imaging  findings  typified  by 
the  underlying  IIP,  although  sometimes  they  obscure  the  preceding 
imaging findings.

Histopathology  Acute  exacerbations  of  underlying  pulmonary 
fibrosis present histopathologically as DAD, although sometimes orga-
nizing pneumonia can also be demonstrated on a surgical lung biopsy.

Treatment  Treatment is mostly supportive. Mechanical ventilation, 
when not being used as a bridge to lung transplantation, is controver-
sial as the survival rate in these patients tends to be poor. There is some 
evidence  that  drug  therapy  (e.g.,  nintedanib)  may  reduce  the  rate  of 
acute exacerbations in patients with IPF. Drug therapy, in the context 
of  an  acute  exacerbation,  is  also  controversial.  Immunosuppressive 
(e.g., prednisone) and cytotoxic (e.g., cyclophosphamide) therapies are 
commonly used without proven benefit.

ILD ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTIVE 
TISSUE DISEASE
ILD is a common disease manifestation of many CTDs. Disease pro-
gression, response to therapy, and survival are variable and associated 
with specific radiologic and histopathologic patterns. ILD occurs most 
commonly  in  patients  with  scleroderma  (systemic  sclerosis  form,  or 
SSc),  RA,  polymyositis/dermatomyositis,  and  less  frequently  Sjögren’s 
syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). ILD may precede 
the development of extrapulmonary manifestations of a specific CTD 
or may present as part of a poorly defined CTD. In rare cases, lung man-
ifestations may be the sole feature of the patient’s clinical presentation.
 ■ SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS
Clinical Manifestations (Chap. 360) 
ILD is the most common 
pulmonary manifestation of SSc. ILD occurs in ~50% of SSc patients 
with diffuse disease and in ~30% of patients with limited disease. Pul-
monary hypertension can occur separately or concomitantly with ILD 
and is more frequent in patients with limited SSc.

HRCT  Image  Findings  Similar  imaging  findings  noted  in  both 
patients with NSIP and IPF can be present, although findings consistent 
with COP and DAD may also be present. Additional HRCT findings 
may include a dilated esophagus and pulmonary artery enlargement.

2196 Histopathology  Comparable  to  the  imaging  overlap,  histopatho-
logic  changes  commonly  noted  in  patients  with  NSIP  and  IPF  are 
frequently  identified.  Additionally,  aspiration  related  to  esophageal 
dysmotility is common in SSc, and in these patients, histopathologic 
findings consistent with COP and DAD may be observed.

Treatment  Cyclophosphamide has a modest benefit in preservation 
of lung function and is associated with significant toxicity. Mycophe-
nolate has recently been shown to have similar efficacy and improved 
tolerability. Clinical trials have demonstrated that antifibrotic therapy 
(e.g.,  nintedanib)  may  benefit  patients  with  systemic  sclerosis  asso-
ciated  pulmonary  fibrosis.  Minimizing  the  risk  of  reflux  by  using 
high-dose  proton  pump  inhibitors  or  antireflux  surgery  should  be 
considered  in  SSc  with  progressive  ILD.  Lung  transplantation  can 
potentially be offered to select patients without significant aspiration 
or chest wall restriction.

 ■ RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
Clinical Manifestations (Chap. 358)  A common extraarticular 
complication of RA is ILD. Although RA is more common in females, 
RA-ILD  is  more  frequent  in  males  and  in  patients  with  a  history  of 
tobacco exposure. In a small subset of patients, ILD is the first disease 
manifestation of RA. Clinically evident RA-ILD occurs in nearly 10% 
of  the  RA  population;  however,  up  to  40–50%  of  RA  patients  have 
radiologic abnormalities on chest CT, suggesting that ILD in the con-
text of RA may be underdiagnosed.

HRCT  Image  Findings  The  most  common  imaging  pattern  of 
ILD in patients with RA is a UIP pattern, although NSIP patterns are 
not uncommon. There is evidence that survival in patients with RA is 
decreased in patients with a UIP pattern and among those with more 
extensive fibrosis in general.

Histopathology  Histopathologic  findings  of  UIP  and  NSIP  are 
most common. Some studies suggest that UIP in the context of RA (as 
compared to IPF) may present with a reduced number of fibroblastic 
foci and an increased amount of germinal centers. Comparable to the 
imaging  findings,  UIP  (and  DAD)  patterns  in  patients  with  RA  are 
associated with reduced survival.

Treatment 
In contrast with SSc, there are no randomized clinical 
trials  testing  the  role  of  immune  suppression  in  RA-ILD.  Extrapo-
lating  from  the  scleroderma  experience,  immunosuppressive  (e.g., 
prednisone)  and  cytotoxic  (e.g.,  mycophenolate,  azathioprine,  cyclo-
phosphamide, and calcineurin inhibitors) agents have been used with 
variable  success.  Clinical  trials  testing  antifibrotic  therapies  (pirfeni-
done  and  nintedanib)  are  presently  being  conducted.  Lung  trans-
plantation  is  a  viable  therapeutic  approach  for  eligible  patients  with 
progressive disease that is not responsive to medical therapy.

 ■ DERMATOMYOSITIS/POLYMYOSITIS
Clinical  Manifestations  (Chap.  365)  The  idiopathic  inflam-
matory myopathies are disorders characterized by immune-mediated 
destruction  and  dysfunction  of  muscle;  however,  these  disorders  can 
affect  the  skin,  joints,  cardiovascular  system,  and  lung.  The  preva-
lence of ILD associated with inflammatory myopathy varies by report; 
however,  ILD  is  present  in  up  to  45%  of  patients  with  positive  anti- 
synthetase antibodies. The anti-synthetase syndrome is characterized 
by positive anti-synthetase antibodies, myositis, fever, Raynaud’s phe-
nomenon, mechanic’s hands, arthritis, and progressive ILD. There is a 
subset  of  anti–Jo-1  antibody–positive  individuals  who  can  develop  a 
rapidly progressive form of ILD consistent with an acute exacerbation. 
Some  studies  have  suggested  that  ILD  may  be  even  more  common 
in  those  with  other  antibodies  (e.g.,  anti-PL-12).  Dermatomyositis/ 
polymyositis can occur as an isolated CTD or as a process associated 
with an underlying malignancy.

HRCT  Image  Findings  Common  imaging  patterns  of  ILD  in 
patients  with  dermatomyositis/polymyositis  include  those  consistent 
with NSIP with or without evidence for COP. A UIP pattern can also 

occur.  Some  studies  have  suggested  that  a  UIP  pattern  may  be  more 
common among those with anti-PL-12 antibodies.

Histopathology  The anti-synthetase syndrome is associated with 
multiple histopathologic subtypes including NSIP, COP, and UIP. DAD, 
a histopathologic pattern observed in AIP and acute exacerbations, is 
associated with rapidly progressive ILD in myositis patients.

Treatment 
Immunosuppressive  (e.g.,  prednisone)  and  cytotoxic 
(e.g., mycophenolate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and calcineurin 
inhibitors) agents are often used in patients with progressive ILD. Some 
patients (particularly those with less fibrosis) have been noted to have 
improved  or  resolved  ILD  in  response  to  medical  therapy.  In  small 
studies,  relapses  have  been  more  common  in  patients  treated  with 
prednisone  alone.  Patients  who  fail  immune-suppressive  therapy  can 
benefit from lung transplantation.

 ■ GRANULOMATOUS ILDS
The  most  common  granulomatous  ILD  is  sarcoidosis,  a  multisystem 
disorder of unknown cause where lung involvement is often the most 
dominant feature; sarcoidosis is discussed in Chap. 367. HP, a granu-
lomatous reaction due to inhalation of organic (e.g., bird fancier’s lung 
secondary to exposure to bird feathers) and inorganic (e.g., coal worker’s 
pneumoconiosis secondary to exposure to coal dusts) dusts, is also an 
important and common cause of ILD and is discussed in Chap. 288.

Granulomatous Vasculitides (See Chap. 64)  These disorders 
are  characterized  by  blood  vessels  with  inflammatory  infiltrates  and 
associated granulomatous lesions with or without the presence of tis-
sue necrosis. The lungs are commonly involved, and a unique feature 
of  these  disorders  is  that  hemoptysis  can  be  a  presenting  symptom. 
Although  laboratory  testing  is  often  helpful  and  can  provide  specific 
information, biopsies of involved tissue can be essential for making the 
diagnosis. Many of these disorders include additional systemic mani-
festations. GPA, also referred to as Wegener’s disease, is an example of 
a granulomatous vasculitis that commonly affects the lung (including 
inflammatory infiltrates in small to medium-sized vessels), ears, nose, 
throat, and kidney (resulting in glomerulonephritis). Common imaging 
abnormalities of GPA include nodules, patchy ground-glass and con-
solidative opacities that can be migratory, and hilar lymphadenopathy. 
Eosinophilic  GPA  (EG;  also  referred  to  as  Churg-Strauss  syndrome) 
is another example of a granulomatous vasculitis that affects the lung 
(including  eosinophilic  infiltrates  in  small  to  medium-sized  vessels) 
and  can  result  in  numerous  clinical  manifestations  but  frequently 
includes chronic sinusitis, asthma, and peripheral blood eosinophilia. 
Common imaging abnormalities of EG include peripheral consolida-
tive opacities that can be migratory and small pleural effusions.

 ■ GENETICS AND ILD
Studies of genetic epidemiology have led to important insights in our 
understanding of ILD. First, studies of families with FPF have demon-
strated that unique IIPs can cosegregate with specific genetic variants 
known  to  be  associated  with  IPF.  This  suggests  that  many  genetic 
variants appear to predispose to interstitial lung injury patterns more 
broadly  than  to  unique  diagnoses  specifically.  Second,  most  of  the 
genetic variants known to be associated with FPF are also associated 
with  more  sporadic  forms  of  the  disease.  Third,  at  least  one  of  the 
genetic factors most strongly associated with FPF and IPF is both com-
mon and confers a large increase in the risk of these diseases. At least 
one copy of a mucin 5B (MUC5B) promoter variant is present in ~20% 
of Caucasian populations and 35–45% of patients with IPF and confers 
an  approximate  sixfold  increase  in  the  risk  of  this  disease.  Fourth, 
studies of general population samples demonstrate that imaging abnor-
malities suggestive of an early stage of pulmonary fibrosis in research 
participants  without  known  ILD  are  not  uncommon  (occurring  in 
~7–9% of adults) and are also associated with the same genetic variants 
known to be associated with IPF (e.g., the MUC5B promoter variant). 
This latter finding suggests a path forward toward an early detection of 
IPF. Additional genetic findings demonstrating replicable associations 
with  pulmonary  fibrosis  include  numerous  genetic  variants  in,  and

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemadjacent to, genes known to be involved in the regulation of telomere 
length (e.g., the TERT gene, the telomerase RNA component [TERC] 
gene, and the regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 [RTEL1] gene) 
and  surfactant  protein  genes  (e.g.,  surfactant  protein  A2  [SFTPA2] 
gene) (Chap. 482).

Genetic studies have also provided some insights into other forms 
of ILD. Genome-wide association studies of sarcoidosis have demon-
strated  numerous  variants  in  genes  and  in  genomic  regions  that  are 
associated  with  the  disease.  Some  of  these  disease-associated  vari-
ants  in  sarcoidosis  fall  in  human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  regions, 
in  regions  of  genes  involved  in  immune  regulation  (e.g.,  interleukin 
12B  [IL12B]),  and  in  regions  of  genes  that  are  less  well  understood 
(butyrophilin-like 2 [BTNL2]) but also appear to be involved in T-cell 
activation. LAM is often associated with genetic variants in the tuber-
ous  sclerosis  complex  genes  (e.g.,  TSC1  and  TSC2),  consistent  with 
the  known  evidence  that  this  disease  can  occur  in  isolation  but  also 
in  patients  with  known  tuberous  sclerosis.  Many  genetic  factors  for 
rare diseases such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (a rare autosomal 
recessive disorder that results in pulmonary fibrosis but also includes 
oculocutaneous  albinism,  bleeding  diatheses,  and  horizontal  nystag-
mus) have also been discovered (e.g., HSP1, and HSP3-7).
 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
The prevalence, clinical presentation, and natural history of most ILDs 
in European countries resemble those described in the United States. 
However, as expected, there is growing evidence for racial differences 
in clinical (rate of acute exacerbations) and genetic (MUC5B) attributes 
between Caucasian and Asian populations. To date, there are limited 
data on the prevalence of ILD in Hispanics, subjects of African descent, 
and many other ethnic groups.

294 Disorders of the Pleura

Richard W. Light*

 ■ PLEURAL EFFUSION
The pleural space lies between the lung and the chest wall and normally 
contains a very thin layer of fluid, which serves as a coupling system. 
A pleural effusion is present when there is an excess quantity of fluid 
in the pleural space.

Etiology  Pleural  fluid  accumulates  when  pleural  fluid  formation 
exceeds  pleural  fluid  absorption.  Normally,  fluid  enters  the  pleural

space  from  the  capillaries  in  the  parietal  pleura  and  is  removed  via 
the lymphatics in the parietal pleura. Fluid also can enter the pleural 
space from the interstitial spaces of the lung via the visceral pleura or 
from the peritoneal cavity via small holes in the diaphragm. The lym-
phatics have the capacity to absorb 20 times more fluid than is formed 
normally.  Accordingly,  a  pleural  effusion  may  develop  when  there  is 
excess pleural fluid formation (from the interstitial spaces of the lung, 
the parietal pleura, or the peritoneal cavity) or when there is decreased 
fluid removal by the lymphatics.

Diagnostic Approach  Patients suspected of having a pleural effu-
sion  should  undergo  chest  imaging  to  diagnose  its  extent.  Chest 
ultrasound  has  replaced  the  lateral  decubitus  x-ray  in  the  evaluation 
of suspected pleural effusions and as a guide to thoracentesis. When a 
patient is found to have a pleural effusion, an effort should be made to 
determine the cause (Fig. 294-1). The first step is to determine whether 
the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. A transudative pleural effusion 
occurs when systemic factors that influence the formation and absorption 
of  pleural  fluid  are  altered.  The  leading  causes  of  transudative  pleural

effusions  in  the  United  States  are  left  ventricular  failure  and  cirrhosis. 
An exudative pleural effusion occurs when local factors that influence the 
formation and absorption of pleural fluid are altered. The leading causes 
of exudative pleural effusions are bacterial pneumonia, malignancy, viral 
infection,  and  pulmonary  embolism.  The  primary  reason  for  making 
this differentiation is that additional diagnostic procedures are indicated 
with exudative effusions to define the cause of the local disease.

Transudative  and  exudative  pleural  effusions  are  distinguished  by 
measuring  the  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  and  protein  levels  in 
the pleural fluid. Exudative pleural effusions meet at least one of the 
following criteria, whereas transudative pleural effusions meet none:

1.  Pleural fluid protein/serum protein >0.5
2.  Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH >0.6
3.  Pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds the normal upper limit for 

serum

These criteria misidentify ~25% of transudates as exudates. If one 
or more of the exudative criteria are met and the patient is clinically 
thought  to  have  a  condition  producing  a  transudative  effusion,  the 
difference between the protein levels in the serum and the pleural fluid 
should be measured. If this gradient is >31 g/L (3.1 g/dL), the exudative 
categorization by these criteria can be ignored because almost all such 
patients have a transudative pleural effusion.

If a patient has an exudative pleural effusion, the following tests on the 
pleural fluid should be obtained: description of the appearance of the fluid, 
glucose level, differential cell count, microbiologic studies, and cytology.

Effusion  Due  to  Heart  Failure  The  most  common  cause  of 
pleural effusion is left ventricular failure. The effusion occurs because 
the  increased  amounts  of  fluid  in  the  lung  interstitial  spaces  exit  in 
part  across  the  visceral  pleura;  this  overwhelms  the  capacity  of  the 
lymphatics in the parietal pleura to remove fluid. In patients with heart 
failure, a diagnostic thoracentesis should be performed if the effusions 
are  not  bilateral  and  comparable  in  size,  if  the  patient  is  febrile,  or 
if  the  patient  has  pleuritic  chest  pain  to  verify  that  the  patient  has  a 
transudative effusion. Otherwise, the patient’s heart failure is treated. If 
the effusion persists despite therapy, a diagnostic thoracentesis should 
be performed. A pleural fluid N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP) level >1500 pg/mL is virtually diagnostic of an effusion 
that is secondary to congestive heart failure.

Hepatic Hydrothorax  Pleural effusions occur in ~5% of patients 
with cirrhosis and ascites. The predominant mechanism is the direct 
movement  of  peritoneal  fluid  through  small  openings  in  the  dia-
phragm into the pleural space. The effusion is usually right-sided and 
frequently is large enough to produce severe dyspnea.

Parapneumonic  Effusion  Parapneumonic  effusions  are  associ-
ated with bacterial pneumonia, lung abscess, or bronchiectasis and are 
probably the most common cause of exudative pleural effusion in the 
United States. Empyema refers to a grossly purulent effusion.

Patients with aerobic bacterial pneumonia and pleural effusion pres-
ent with an acute febrile illness consisting of chest pain, sputum pro-
duction,  and  leukocytosis.  Patients  with  anaerobic  infections  present 
with a subacute illness with weight loss, a brisk leukocytosis, mild ane-
mia, and a history of some factor that predisposes them to aspiration.
The possibility of a parapneumonic effusion should be considered 
whenever  a  patient  with  bacterial  pneumonia  is  initially  evaluated. 
The presence of free pleural fluid can be demonstrated with a lateral 
decubitus  radiograph,  computed  tomography  (CT)  of  the  chest,  or 
ultrasound. If the free fluid separates the lung from the chest wall by 
>10  mm,  a  therapeutic  thoracentesis  should  be  performed.  Factors 
indicating  the  likely  need  for  a  procedure  more  invasive  than  a  tho-
racentesis (in increasing order of importance) include the following:

1.  Loculated pleural fluid
2.  Pleural fluid pH <7.20
3.  Pleural fluid glucose <3.3 mmol/L (<60 mg/dL)
4.  Positive Gram stain or culture of the pleural fluid
5.  Presence of gross pus in the pleural space

If  the  fluid  recurs  after  the  initial  therapeutic  thoracentesis  and  if 
any  of  these  characteristics  is  present,  a  repeat  thoracentesis  should 
be  performed.  If  the  fluid  cannot  be  completely  removed  with  the 
therapeutic thoracentesis, consideration should be given to inserting a 
chest tube and instilling the combination of a fibrinolytic agent (e.g., 
tissue plasminogen activator, 10 mg) and deoxyribonuclease (5 mg) or 
performing a thoracoscopy with the breakdown of adhesions. Decorti-
cation should be considered when these measures are ineffective.

Effusion Secondary to Malignancy  Malignant pleural effusions 
secondary to metastatic disease are the second most common type of 
exudative  pleural  effusion.  The  three  tumors  that  cause  ~75%  of  all 
malignant pleural effusions are lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and 
lymphoma. Most patients complain of dyspnea, which is frequently out 
of proportion to the size of the effusion. The pleural fluid is an exudate, 
and its glucose level may be reduced if the tumor burden in the pleural 
space is high.

The diagnosis usually is made via cytology of the pleural fluid. If the 
initial  cytologic  examination  is  negative,  thoracoscopy  is  the  best  next 
procedure if malignancy is strongly suspected. At the time of thoracos-
copy, a procedure such as pleural abrasion should be performed to effect a 
pleurodesis. An alternative to thoracoscopy is CT- or ultrasound-guided 
needle biopsy of pleural thickening or nodules. Patients with a malig-
nant  pleural  effusion  are  treated  symptomatically  for  the  most  part, 
since the presence of the effusion indicates disseminated disease and 
most malignancies associated with pleural effusion are not curable with 
chemotherapy. The only symptom that can be attributed to the effusion 
itself  is  dyspnea.  If  the  patient’s  lifestyle  is  compromised  by  dyspnea 
and if the dyspnea is relieved with a therapeutic thoracentesis, one of 
the following procedures should be considered: (1) insertion of a small 
indwelling catheter or (2) tube thoracostomy with the instillation of a 
sclerosing agent such as doxycycline (500 mg).

Mesothelioma  Malignant mesotheliomas are primary tumors that 
arise from the mesothelial cells that line the pleural cavities; most are 
related to asbestos exposure. Patients with mesothelioma present with 
chest  pain  and  shortness  of  breath.  The  chest  radiograph  reveals  a 
pleural effusion, generalized pleural thickening, and a shrunken hem-
ithorax. The diagnosis is usually established with image-guided needle 
biopsy or thoracoscopy (Fig. 294-2).

Effusion  Secondary  to  Pulmonary  Embolization  The  diag-
nosis  most  commonly  overlooked  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of  a 
patient with an undiagnosed pleural effusion is pulmonary embolism. 
Dyspnea  is  the  most  common  symptom.  The  pleural  fluid  is  almost 
always  an  exudate.  The  diagnosis  is  established  by  spiral  CT  scan  or 
pulmonary arteriography (Chap. 279). Treatment of a patient with a 
pleural effusion secondary to pulmonary embolism is the same as it is 

FIGURE  294-2  CT  scan  from  a  patient  with  mesothelioma  demonstrating  a  mass 
in the left lung, a pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and a shrunken hemithorax.

for any patient with pulmonary emboli. If the pleural effusion increases 
in size after anticoagulation, the patient probably has recurrent emboli 
or another complication, such as a hemothorax or a pleural infection.

Tuberculous  Pleuritis 
(See  also  Chap.  178)  In  many  parts  of 
the  world,  the  most  common  cause  of  an  exudative  pleural  effusion 
is  tuberculosis  (TB),  but  tuberculous  effusions  are  relatively  uncom-
mon  in  the  United  States.  Tuberculous  pleural  effusions  usually  are 
associated with primary TB and are thought to be due primarily to a 
hypersensitivity  reaction  to  tuberculous  protein  in  the  pleural  space. 
Patients  with  tuberculous  pleuritis  present  with  fever,  weight  loss, 
dyspnea,  and/or  pleuritic  chest  pain.  The  pleural  fluid  is  an  exudate 
with  predominantly  small  lymphocytes.  The  diagnosis  is  established 
by demonstrating high levels of TB markers in the pleural fluid (ade-
nosine deaminase >40 IU/L or interferon γ >140 pg/mL). Alternatively, 
the diagnosis can be established by culture of the pleural fluid, needle 
biopsy of the pleura, or thoracoscopy. The recommended treatments of 
pleural and pulmonary TB are identical (Chap. 178).

Effusion  Secondary  to  Viral  Infection  Viral  infections  are 
probably responsible for a sizable percentage of undiagnosed exudative 
pleural effusions. In many series, no diagnosis is established for ~20% 
of exudative effusions, and these effusions resolve spontaneously with 
no  long-term  residua.  The  importance  of  these  effusions  is  that  one 
should not be too aggressive in trying to establish a diagnosis for the 
undiagnosed effusion, particularly if the patient is improving clinically.

Chylothorax  A chylothorax occurs when the thoracic duct is dis-
rupted and chyle accumulates in the pleural space. The most common 
cause  of  chylothorax  is  trauma  (most  frequently  thoracic  surgery), 
but it also may result from tumors in the mediastinum. Patients with 
chylothorax  present  with  dyspnea,  and  a  large  pleural  effusion  is 
present  on  the  chest  radiograph.  Thoracentesis  reveals  milky  fluid, 
and  biochemical  analysis  reveals  a  triglyceride  level  that  exceeds  
1.2  mmol/L  (110  mg/dL).  Patients  with  chylothorax  and  no  obvious 
trauma should have a lymphangiogram and a mediastinal CT scan to 
assess the mediastinum for lymph nodes. The treatment of choice for 
most chylothoraces is insertion of a chest tube plus the administration 
of  octreotide.  If  these  modalities  fail,  percutaneous  transabdominal 
thoracic  duct  blockage  effectively  controls  most  chylothoraces.  An 
alternative  treatment  is  ligation  of  the  thoracic  duct.  Patients  with 
chylothoraces should not undergo prolonged tube thoracostomy with 
chest tube drainage because this will lead to malnutrition and immu-
nologic incompetence.

Hemothorax  When  a  diagnostic  thoracentesis  reveals  bloody 
pleural fluid, a hematocrit should be obtained on the pleural fluid. If 
the hematocrit is more than one-half of that in the peripheral blood, 
the  patient  is  considered  to  have  a  hemothorax.  Most  hemothoraces 
are the result of trauma; other causes include rupture of a blood vessel 
or tumor. Most patients with hemothorax should be treated with tube 
thoracostomy,  which  allows  continuous  quantification  of  bleeding.  If 
the  bleeding  emanates  from  a  laceration  of  the  pleura,  apposition  of 
the  two  pleural  surfaces  is  likely  to  stop  the  bleeding.  If  the  pleural 
hemorrhage exceeds 200 mL/h, consideration should be given to angi-
ographic coil embolization, thoracoscopy, or thoracotomy.

Miscellaneous  Causes  of  Pleural  Effusion  There  are  many 
other  causes  of  pleural  effusion  (Table  294-1).  Key  features  of  some 
of these conditions are as follows: If the pleural fluid amylase level is 
elevated, the diagnosis of esophageal rupture or pancreatic disease is 
likely. If the patient is febrile, has predominantly polymorphonuclear 
cells in the pleural fluid, and has no pulmonary parenchymal abnor-
malities, an intraabdominal abscess should be considered.

The  diagnosis  of  an  asbestos  pleural  effusion  is  one  of  exclusions. 
Benign  ovarian  tumors  can  produce  ascites  and  a  pleural  effusion 
(Meigs’  syndrome),  as  can  the  ovarian  hyperstimulation  syndrome. 
Several  drugs  can  cause  pleural  effusion;  the  associated  fluid  is  usu-
ally  eosinophilic.  Pleural  effusions  commonly  occur  after  coronary 
artery  bypass  surgery.  Effusions  occurring  within  the  first  weeks  are

 ■ PNEUMOTHORAX
Pneumothorax is the presence of gas in the pleural space. A spontane-
ous pneumothorax is one that occurs without antecedent trauma to the 
thorax.  A  primary  spontaneous  pneumothorax  occurs  in  the  absence 
of underlying lung disease, whereas a secondary pneumothorax occurs 
in its presence. A traumatic pneumothorax results from penetrating or 
nonpenetrating chest injuries. A tension pneumothorax is a pneumot-
horax in which the pressure in the pleural space is positive throughout 
the respiratory cycle.

Primary  Spontaneous  Pneumothorax  Primary  spontaneous 
pneumothoraces  are  usually  due  to  rupture  of  apical  pleural  blebs, 
small  cystic  spaces  that  lie  within  or  immediately  under  the  visceral 
pleura.  Primary  spontaneous  pneumothoraces  occur  almost  exclu-
sively in smokers; this suggests that these patients have subclinical lung 
disease.  Approximately  one-half  of  patients  with  an  initial  primary 
spontaneous pneumothorax will have a recurrence. The initial recom-
mended treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax is simple 
aspiration. If the lung does not expand with aspiration or if the patient 
has  a  recurrent  pneumothorax,  thoracoscopy  with  stapling  of  blebs 
and pleural abrasion is indicated. Thoracoscopy or thoracotomy with 
pleural abrasion is almost 100% successful in preventing recurrences.

Secondary Pneumothorax  Most secondary pneumothoraces are 
due  to  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  but  pneumothoraces 
have been reported with virtually every lung disease. Pneumothorax in 
patients with lung disease is more life-threatening than it is in normal 
individuals because of the lack of pulmonary reserve in these patients. 
Nearly  all  patients  with  secondary  pneumothorax  should  be  treated 
with tube thoracostomy. Most should also be treated with thoracoscopy 
or thoracotomy with the stapling of blebs and pleural abrasion. If the 
patient is not a good operative candidate or refuses surgery, pleurodesis 
should be attempted by the intrapleural injection of a sclerosing agent 
such as doxycycline.

Traumatic Pneumothorax  Traumatic pneumothoraces can result 
from  both  penetrating  and  nonpenetrating  chest  trauma.  Traumatic 
pneumothoraces  should  be  treated  with  tube  thoracostomy  unless 
they are very small. If a hemopneumothorax is present, one chest tube 
should be placed in the superior part of the hemithorax to evacuate the 
air and another should be placed in the inferior part of the hemithorax 
to remove the blood. Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a type of traumatic 
pneumothorax  that  is  becoming  more  common.  The  leading  causes 
are transthoracic needle aspiration, thoracentesis, and the insertion of 
central intravenous catheters. Most can be managed with supplemental 
oxygen  or  aspiration,  but  if  these  measures  are  unsuccessful,  a  tube 
thoracostomy should be performed.

Tension  Pneumothorax  This  condition  usually  occurs  during 
mechanical  ventilation  or  resuscitative  efforts.  The  positive  pleural 
pressure  is  life-threatening  both  because  ventilation  is  severely  com-
promised and because the positive pressure is transmitted to the medi-
astinum, resulting in decreased venous return to the heart and reduced 
cardiac output.

Difficulty  in  ventilation  during  resuscitation  or  high  peak  inspi-
ratory  pressures  during  mechanical  ventilation  strongly  suggest  the 
diagnosis. The diagnosis is made by physical examination showing an 
enlarged  hemithorax  with  no  breath  sounds,  hyperresonance  to  per-
cussion, and shift of the mediastinum to the contralateral side. Tension 
pneumothorax must be treated as a medical emergency. If the tension 
in  the  pleural  space  is  not  relieved,  the  patient  is  likely  to  die  from 
inadequate cardiac output or marked hypoxemia. A large-bore needle 
should be inserted into the pleural space through the second anterior 
intercostal space. If large amounts of gas escape from the needle after 

insertion, the diagnosis is confirmed. The needle should be left in place 
until a thoracostomy tube can be inserted.

295 Disorders of the  
Mediastinum
Richard W. Light*

The mediastinum is the region between the pleural sacs. It is separated 
into  three  compartments  (Table  295-1).  The  anterior  mediastinum 
extends from the sternum anteriorly to the pericardium and brachio-
cephalic vessels posteriorly. It contains the thymus gland, the anterior 
mediastinal  lymph  nodes,  and  the  internal  mammary  arteries  and 
veins. The middle mediastinum lies between the anterior and posterior 
mediastina and contains the heart; the ascending and transverse arches 
of  the  aorta;  the  venae  cavae;  the  brachiocephalic  arteries  and  veins; 
the phrenic nerves; the trachea, the main bronchi, and their contigu-
ous lymph nodes; and the pulmonary arteries and veins. The posterior 
mediastinum is bounded by the pericardium and trachea anteriorly and 
the  vertebral  column  posteriorly.  It  contains  the  descending  thoracic 
aorta,  the  esophagus,  the  thoracic  duct,  the  azygos  and  hemiazygos 
veins, and the posterior group of mediastinal lymph nodes.

 ■ MEDIASTINAL MASSES
The first step in evaluating a mediastinal mass is to place it in one of the 
three mediastinal compartments, since each has different characteristic 
lesions (Table 295-1).

Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the most valuable imaging 
technique  for  evaluating  mediastinal  masses  and  is  the  only  imaging 
technique  that  should  be  done  in  most  instances.  Barium  studies  of 
the gastrointestinal tract are indicated in many patients with posterior 
mediastinal  lesions,  becauseg  hernias,  diverticula,  and  achalasia  are 
readily diagnosed in this manner. An iodine-131 scan can efficiently 
establish the diagnosis of intrathoracic goiter.

A  definite  diagnosis  can  be  obtained  with  mediastinoscopy  or 
anterior mediastinotomy in many patients with masses in the anterior 
or middle mediastinal compartments. A diagnosis can be established 
without  thoracotomy  via  percutaneous  fine-needle  aspiration  biopsy 
or  endoscopic  transesophageal  or  endobronchial  ultrasound-guided 
biopsy  of  mediastinal  masses  in  most  cases.  An  alternative  way  to 
establish the diagnosis is video-assisted thoracoscopy. In many cases, 
the  diagnosis  can  be  established  and  the  mediastinal  mass  removed 
with video-assisted thoracoscopy.

 ■ ACUTE MEDIASTINITIS
Cases of acute mediastinitis are usually due to esophageal perforation, 
occur  after  median  sternotomy  for  cardiac  surgery,  or  are  infections 
descending  from  the  neck,  oral  cavity,  or  facial  area.  Patients  with

esophageal rupture are acutely ill with chest pain and dyspnea due to 
the  mediastinal  infection.  The  esophageal  rupture  can  occur  sponta-
neously  or  as  a  complication  of  esophagoscopy  or  the  insertion  of  a 
Blakemore tube. Appropriate treatment consists of exploration of the 
mediastinum with primary repair of the esophageal tear and drainage 
of the pleural space and the mediastinum.

The incidence of mediastinitis after median sternotomy is 0.4–5.0%. 
Patients  most  commonly  present  with  wound  drainage.  Other  pre-
sentations include sepsis and a widened mediastinum. The diagnosis 
usually  is  established  with  mediastinal  needle  aspiration.  Treatment 
includes  immediate  drainage,  debridement,  and  parenteral  antibiotic 
therapy, but the mortality rate still exceeds 20%.

 ■ CHRONIC MEDIASTINITIS
The  spectrum  of  chronic  mediastinitis  ranges  from  granulomatous 
inflammation  of  the  lymph  nodes  in  the  mediastinum  to  fibrosing 
mediastinitis. Most cases are due to histoplasmosis or tuberculosis, but 
sarcoidosis, silicosis, and other fungal diseases are at times causative. 
Patients  with  granulomatous  mediastinitis  are  usually  asymptomatic. 
Those with fibrosing mediastinitis usually have signs of compression of 
a mediastinal structure such as the superior vena cava or large airways, 
phrenic  or  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve  paralysis,  or  obstruction  of  the 
pulmonary artery or proximal pulmonary veins. If veins or arteries are 
involved, the placement of stents has relieved the symptoms in many 
patients.

 ■ PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM
In  this  condition,  there  is  gas  in  the  interstices  of  the  mediastinum. 
The  three  main  causes  are  (1)  alveolar  rupture  with  dissection  of  air 
into  the  mediastinum;  (2)  perforation  or  rupture  of  the  esophagus, 
trachea,  or  main  bronchi;  and  (3)  dissection  of  air  from  the  neck  or 
the abdomen into the mediastinum. Typically, there is severe subster-
nal chest pain with or without radiation into the neck and arms. The 
physical examination usually reveals subcutaneous emphysema in the 
suprasternal notch and Hamman’s sign, which is a crunching or click-
ing noise synchronous with the heartbeat and is best heard in the left 
lateral  decubitus  position.  The  diagnosis  is  confirmed  with  the  chest 
radiograph. Usually no treatment is required, but the mediastinal air 
will  be  absorbed  faster  if  the  patient  inspires  high  concentrations  of 
oxygen. If mediastinal structures are compressed, the compression can 
be relieved with needle aspiration.

296 Disorders of Ventilation

John F. McConville, Julian Solway,  
Babak Mokhlesi

DEFINITION AND PHYSIOLOGY
In  health,  the  arterial  level  of  carbon  dioxide  (Paco2)  is  maintained 
between 37 and 43 mmHg at sea level. All disorders of ventilation result 
in  abnormal  measurements  of  Paco2.  This  chapter  reviews  chronic 
ventilatory disorders.

.

The  continuous  production  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  by  cellular 
metabolism necessitates its efficient elimination by the respiratory sys-
tem. The relationship between CO2 production and Paco2 is described 
 co2  represents  the 
by  the  equation:  Paco2  =  (k)  (V
 co2)/V
. 
A is fresh gas alveolar 
carbon dioxide production, k is a constant, and V
. 
A can be calculated as minute ventilation ×  
ventilation (Chap. 285). V
(1 – Vd/Vt), where the dead space fraction Vd/Vt represents the por-
tion  of  a  tidal  breath  that  remains  within  the  conducting  airways  at 
the  conclusion  of  inspiration  and  so  does  not  contribute  to  alveolar 
ventilation. As such, all disturbances of Paco2 must reflect altered CO2 
production, minute ventilation, or dead space fraction.

Diseases  that  alter  (V

 co2)  are  often  acute  (e.g.,  sepsis,  burns,  or 
pyrexia),  and  their  contribution  to  ventilatory  abnormalities  and/or 
respiratory failure is reviewed elsewhere. Chronic ventilatory disorders 
typically involve inappropriate levels of minute ventilation or increased 
dead  space  fraction.  Characterization  of  these  disorders  requires  a 
review of the normal respiratory cycle.

The spontaneous cycle of inspiration and expiration is automatically 
generated  in  the  brainstem.  Two  groups  of  neurons  located  within 
the  medulla  are  particularly  important:  the  dorsal  respiratory  group 
(DRG) and the ventral respiratory column (VRC). These neurons have 
widespread projections including the descending projections into the 
contralateral  spinal  cord  where  they  perform  many  functions.  They 
initiate activity in the phrenic nerve/diaphragm, project to the upper 
airway  muscle  groups  and  spinal  respiratory  neurons,  and  innervate 
the  intercostal  and  abdominal  muscles  that  participate  in  normal 
respiration.  The  DRG  acts  as  the  initial  integration  site  for  many  of 
the  afferent  nerves  relaying  information  about  Pao2,  Paco2,  pH,  and 
blood pressure from the carotid and aortic chemoreceptors and barore-
ceptors  to  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS).  In  addition,  the  vagus 
nerve relays information from stretch receptors and juxtapulmonary- 
capillary receptors in the lung parenchyma and chest wall to the DRG. 
The  respiratory  rhythm  is  generated  within  the  VRC  as  well  as  the 
more  rostrally  located  parafacial  respiratory  group  (pFRG),  which  is 
particularly important for the generation of active expiration. One par-
ticularly important area within the VRC is the so-called pre-Bötzinger 
complex. This area is responsible for the generation of various forms

of  inspiratory  activity,  and  lesioning  of  the  pre-Bötzinger  complex 
leads  to  the  complete  cessation  of  breathing.  The  neural  output  of 
these  medullary  respiratory  networks  can  be  voluntarily  suppressed 
or augmented by input from higher brain centers and the autonomic 
nervous system. During normal sleep, there is an attenuated response 
to hypercapnia and hypoxemia, resulting in mild nocturnal hypoventi-
lation that corrects upon awakening.

Once  neural  input  has  been  delivered  to  the  respiratory  pump 
muscles, normal gas exchange requires an adequate amount of respi-
ratory  muscle  strength  to  overcome  the  elastic  and  resistive  loads  of 
the respiratory system (Fig. 296-1A) (also see Chap. 285). In health,

the strength of the respiratory muscles readily accomplishes this, and 
normal  respiration  continues  indefinitely.  Reduction  in  respiratory 
drive  or  neuromuscular  competence  or  substantial  increase  in  respi-
ratory load can diminish minute ventilation, resulting in hypercapnia 
(Fig.  296-1B).  Alternatively,  if  normal  respiratory  muscle  strength  is 
coupled with excessive respiratory drive, then alveolar hyperventilation 
ensues and leads to hypocapnia (Fig. 296-1C).

HYPOVENTILATION
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Diseases  that  reduce  minute  ventilation  or  increase  dead  space  fall 
into  four  major  categories:  parenchymal  lung  and  chest  wall  disease, 
sleep-disordered  breathing,  neuromuscular  disease,  and  respiratory 
drive disorders (Fig. 296-1B). The clinical manifestations of hypoventi-
lation syndromes are nonspecific (Table 296-1) and vary depending on 
the severity of hypoventilation, the rate at which hypercapnia develops, 
the degree of compensation for respiratory acidosis, and the underlying 
disorder. Patients with parenchymal lung or chest wall disease typically 
present  with  shortness  of  breath  and  diminished  exercise  tolerance. 
Episodes of increased dyspnea and sputum production are hallmarks 
of obstructive lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD), whereas progressive dyspnea and cough are common in 
interstitial lung diseases. Excessive daytime somnolence, poor-quality 
sleep, and snoring are common among patients with sleep-disordered 
breathing.  Sleep  disturbance  and  orthopnea  are  also  described  in 
neuromuscular disorders. As neuromuscular weakness progresses, the 
respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm, are placed at a mechan-
ical disadvantage in the supine position due to the upward movement 
of the abdominal contents. New-onset orthopnea is frequently a sign 
of reduced respiratory muscle force generation. More commonly, how-
ever,  extremity  weakness  or  bulbar  symptoms  develop  prior  to  sleep 
disturbance  in  neuromuscular  diseases  such  as  amyotrophic  lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) or muscular dystrophy. Patients with respiratory drive 
disorders do not have symptoms distinguishable from other causes of 
chronic hypoventilation.

The  clinical  course  of  patients  with  chronic  hypoventilation  from 
neuromuscular or chest wall disease follows a characteristic sequence: 
an  asymptomatic  stage  where  daytime  Pao2  and  Paco2  are  normal 
followed by nocturnal hypoventilation, initially during rapid eye move-
ment (REM) sleep and later in non-REM sleep. Finally, if vital capacity 
drops further, daytime hypercapnia develops. Symptoms can develop at 
any point along this time course and often depend on the pace of respi-
ratory muscle functional decline. Regardless of cause, the hallmark of 
all alveolar hypoventilation syndromes is an increase in alveolar Pco2 
(PAco2)  and  therefore  in  Paco2.  The  resulting  respiratory  acidosis 
eventually leads to a compensatory increase in plasma bicarbonate con-
centration. The increase in Paco2 results in an obligatory decrease in 
PAo2, often resulting in hypoxemia. If severe, the hypoxemia manifests 
clinically as cyanosis and can stimulate erythropoiesis and thus induce 
secondary erythrocytosis. The combination of chronic hypoxemia and 
hypercapnia  may  also  induce  pulmonary  vasoconstriction,  leading 
eventually to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, 
and right heart failure.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Elevated serum bicarbonate (i.e., total serum CO2, which equals calcu-
lated bicarbonate plus dissolved CO2) in the absence of volume deple-
tion is suggestive of hypoventilation. However, it is important to point

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemout that a serum bicarbonate level <27 mmol/L in the setting of normal 
renal  function  makes  the  diagnosis  of  hypoventilation  very  unlikely. 
By contrast, a serum bicarbonate level ≥27 mmol/L should trigger cli-
nicians to measure Paco2 as a confirmatory diagnostic test. Therefore, 
serum  bicarbonate  can  be  used  as  a  sensitive  test  to  rule  out  hyper-
capnia, not to rule it in. An arterial blood gas demonstrating elevated 
Paco2  with  a  normal  pH  confirms  chronic  alveolar  hypoventilation. 
The subsequent evaluation to identify an etiology should initially focus 
on  whether  the  patient  has  lung  disease  or  chest  wall  abnormalities. 
Physical  examination,  imaging  studies  (chest  x-ray  and/or  CT  scan), 
and  pulmonary  function  tests  are  sufficient  to  identify  most  lung/
chest  wall  disorders  leading  to  hypercapnia.  If  these  evaluations  are 
unrevealing,  the  clinician  should  screen  for  obesity  hypoventilation 
syndrome (OHS), the most frequent sleep disorder leading to chronic 
hypoventilation,  which  is  typically  accompanied  by  obstructive  sleep 
apnea (OSA). Several screening tools have been developed to identify 
patients at risk for OSA. The Berlin Questionnaire has been validated 
in  a  primary  care  setting  and  identifies  patients  likely  to  have  OSA. 
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) measures daytime sleepiness, with 
a  score  of  ≥10  identifying  individuals  who  warrant  additional  inves-
tigation; however, it is not a useful test to screen for sleep-disordered 
breathing. Owing to its ease of use, the STOP-Bang questionnaire has 
become  a  popular  tool  to  screen  for  OSA  and  has  been  validated  in 
various outpatient settings. The STOP-Bang survey has been used in 
preoperative  anesthesia  clinics  to  identify  patients  at  risk  of  having 
OSA. In this population, it has 93% sensitivity and 90% negative pre-
dictive  value.  Additionally,  the  STOP-Bang  questionnaire  has  been 
validated as a screening tool for OSA in sleep and surgical clinics. The 
probability of moderate and severe OSA steadily increases with higher 
STOP-Bang scores.

If the ventilatory apparatus (lung, airways, chest wall) is not respon-
sible for chronic hypercapnia, then the focus should shift to respiratory 
drive  and  neuromuscular  disorders.  There  is  an  attenuated  increase 
in  minute  ventilation  in  response  to  elevated  CO2  and/or  low  O2  in 
respiratory  drive  disorders.  These  diseases  are  difficult  to  diagnose 
and  should  be  suspected  when  patients  with  hypercapnia  are  found 
to have normal respiratory muscle strength, normal pulmonary func-
tion,  and  normal  alveolar-arterial  Po2  difference.  Hypoventilation  is 
more  marked  during  sleep  in  patients  with  respiratory  drive  defects, 
and  polysomnography  often  reveals  central  apneas,  hypopneas,  or 
hypoventilation.  Brain  imaging  (CT  scan  or  MRI)  can  sometimes 
identify structural abnormalities in the pons or medulla that result in 
hypoventilation.  Chronic  narcotic  use  or  significant  hypothyroidism 
can  depress  the  central  respiratory  drive  and  lead  to  chronic  hyper-
capnia as well.

Respiratory  muscle  weakness  has  to  be  profound  before  lung  vol-
umes are compromised and hypercapnia develops. Typically, physical 
examination reveals decreased strength in major muscle groups prior 
to the development of hypercapnia. Measurement of maximum inspi-
ratory and expiratory pressures or forced vital capacity (FVC) can be 
used  to  monitor  for  respiratory  muscle  involvement  in  diseases  with 
progressive muscle weakness. These patients also have increased risk 
for  sleep-disordered  breathing,  including  hypopneas,  central  and 
obstructive apneas, and hypoxemia. Nighttime oximetry and capnom-
etry during polysomnography are helpful in better characterizing sleep 
disturbances in this patient population.

TREATMENT
Hypoventilation

Nocturnal  noninvasive  positive-pressure  ventilation  (NIPPV)  has 
been  used  successfully  in  the  treatment  of  hypoventilation  and 
apneas,  both  central  and  obstructive,  in  patients  with  neuromus-
cular and chest wall disorders. Nocturnal NIPPV has been shown 
to  improve  daytime  hypercapnia,  prolong  survival,  and  improve 
health-related  quality  of  life  when  daytime  hypercapnia  is  doc-
umented.  ALS  guidelines  recommend  consideration  of  noctur-
nal  NIPPV  if  symptoms  of  hypoventilation  exist  and  one  of  the

following criteria is present: Paco2 ≥45 mmHg; nocturnal oxime-
try  demonstrates  oxygen  saturation  ≤88%  for  5  consecutive  min; 
maximal  inspiratory  pressure  <60  cmH2O;  or  sniff  nasal  pressure   
<40 cmH2O and FVC <50% predicted. However, at present, there is 
inconclusive evidence to support preemptive nocturnal NIPPV use 
in  all  patients  with  neuromuscular  and  chest  wall  disorders  who 
demonstrate nocturnal but not daytime hypercapnia. Nevertheless, 
at some point, the institution of full-time ventilatory support with 
either pressure or volume-preset modes is required in progressive 
neuromuscular disorders. There is less evidence to direct the timing 
of this decision, but ventilatory failure requiring mechanical venti-
lation and chest infections related to ineffective cough are frequent 
triggers for the institution of full-time ventilatory support.

Treatment  of  chronic  hypoventilation  from  lung  or  neuro-
muscular  diseases  should  be  directed  at  the  underlying  disorder. 
Pharmacologic agents that stimulate respiration, such as medroxy-
progesterone  and  acetazolamide,  have  been  poorly  studied  in 
chronic  hypoventilation  and  should  not  replace  treatment  of  the 
underlying disease process. Regardless of the cause, excessive met-
abolic  alkalosis  should  be  corrected,  as  serum  bicarbonate  levels 
elevated  out  of  proportion  for  the  degree  of  chronic  respiratory 
acidosis can result in additional hypoventilation. When indicated, 
administration  of  supplemental  oxygen  is  effective  in  attenuating 
hypoxemia, polycythemia, and pulmonary hypertension. However, 
in some patients, supplemental oxygen, even at low concentrations, 
can worsen hypercapnia.

Phrenic  nerve  or  diaphragm  pacing  is  a  potential  therapy  for 
patients with hypoventilation from high cervical spinal cord lesions 
or  respiratory  drive  disorders.  Prior  to  surgical  implantation, 
patients  should  have  nerve  conduction  studies  to  ensure  normal 
bilateral  phrenic  nerve  function.  Small  case  series  suggest  that 
effective diaphragmatic pacing can improve quality of life in these 
patients.

HYPOVENTILATION SYNDROMES
 ■ OBESITY HYPOVENTILATION SYNDROME
The diagnosis of OHS requires the following: body mass index (BMI) 
≥30 kg/m2; chronic daytime alveolar hypoventilation, defined as Paco2 
≥45 mmHg at sea level in the absence of other known causes of hyper-
capnia; and evidence of sleep-disordered breathing. In almost 90% of 
cases, the sleep-disordered breathing is in the form of OSA, with close 
to 70% exhibiting severe OSA. Several international studies in different 
populations  confirm  that  the  overall  prevalence  of  OSA  syndrome, 
defined  by  an  apnea-hypopnea  index  ≥5  and  daytime  sleepiness,  is 
~14% in men and 5% in women aged 30–70 years in the United States. 
Thus, the population at risk for the development of OHS continues to 
rise  as  the  worldwide  obesity  epidemic  persists.  Although  no  popu-
lation-based  prevalence  studies  of  OHS  have  been  performed,  some 
estimates suggest it may be as high as 0.4% of the U.S. adult population 
(or 1 in 263 adults).

Some, but not all, studies suggest that severe obesity (BMI >40 kg/
m2)  and  severe  OSA  (AHI  >30  events  per  h)  are  risk  factors  for  the 
development  of  OHS.  The  pathogenesis  of  hypoventilation  in  these 
patients is the result of multiple physiologic variables and conditions 
including  OSA,  increased  work  of  breathing,  respiratory  muscle 
impairment relative to the increased load because of excess adiposity, 
ventilation-perfusion  mismatching,  and  depressed  central  ventilatory 
responsiveness to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. These defects in central 
respiratory  drive  often  improve  with  treatment  of  sleep-disordered 
breathing with CPAP or NIPPV without any significant change in body 
weight,  which  suggests  that  decreased  ventilatory  responsiveness  is  a 
consequence  rather  than  a  primary  cause  of  OHS.  The  treatment  of 
OHS is similar to that for OSA: weight reduction and positive airway 
pressure  therapy  during  sleep  with  either  continuous  positive  airway 
pressure (CPAP) or NIPPV. There is evidence that substantial weight 
loss  (i.e.,  20–25%  of  actual  body  weight)  alone  normalizes  Paco2 
in  patients  with  OHS.  Unfortunately,  achieving  and  sustaining  this

2204 degree of weight loss without bariatric surgery are very challenging for 
most patients. Treatment with CPAP or NIPPV should not be delayed 
while  the  patient  attempts  to  lose  weight.  CPAP  improves  daytime 
hypercapnia and hypoxemia in more than half of patients with OHS 
and concomitant severe OSA. Bilevel positive airway pressure without 
a  backup  rate  (bilevel  PAP  spontaneous  mode)  should  be  reserved 
for patients not able to tolerate high levels of CPAP support or when 
obstructive  respiratory  events  persist  despite  reaching  the  maximum 
CPAP pressure of 20 cmH2O. NIPPV in the form of bilevel PAP with a 
backup rate (bilevel PAP ST or spontaneous timed) or volume-assured 
pressure support modes should be strongly considered if hypercapnia 
persists  after  several  weeks  of  CPAP  therapy  with  objectively  proven 
adherence. Patients with OHS and no evidence of significant OSA are 
typically started on bilevel PAP ST or volume-assured pressure support 
modes,  as  are  patients  presenting  with  acute  decompensated  OHS. 
Finally,  comorbid  conditions  that  impair  ventilation,  such  as  COPD, 
should be aggressively treated in conjunction with coexisting OHS.

 ■ CENTRAL HYPOVENTILATION SYNDROME
This syndrome can present later in life or in the neonatal period, when 
it is often called Ondine’s curse or congenital central hypoventilation 
syndrome  (CCHS).  Abnormalities  in  the  gene  encoding  PHOX2b,  a 
transcription  factor  with  a  role  in  neuronal  development,  have  been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of CCHS. Regardless of the age of onset, 
these  patients  have  absent  respiratory  response  to  hypoxia  or  hyper-
capnia,  mildly  elevated  Paco2  while  awake,  and  markedly  elevated 
Paco2 during non-REM sleep. Interestingly, these patients are able to 
augment their ventilation and “normalize” Paco2 during exercise and 
during REM sleep. These patients typically require NIPPV or mechan-
ical ventilation as therapy and should be considered for phrenic nerve 
or diaphragmatic pacing at centers with experience performing these 
procedures.

HYPERVENTILATION
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Hyperventilation  is  defined  as  ventilation  in  excess  of  metabolic 
requirements  (CO2  production)  leading  to  a  reduction  in  Paco2. 
The  physiology  of  patients  with  chronic  hyperventilation  is  poorly 
understood,  and  there  is  no  typical  clinical  presentation.  Symptoms 
can  include  dyspnea,  paresthesias,  tetany,  headache,  dizziness,  visual 
disturbances,  and  atypical  chest  pain.  Because  symptoms  can  be  so 
diverse, patients with chronic hyperventilation present to a variety of 
health care providers, including internists, neurologists, psychologists, 
psychiatrists, and pulmonologists.

It is helpful to think of hyperventilation as having initiating and sus-
taining factors. Some investigators believe that an initial event leads to 
increased alveolar ventilation and a drop in Paco2 to ~20 mmHg. The 
ensuing onset of chest pain, breathlessness, paresthesia, or altered con-
sciousness can be alarming. The resultant increase in minute volume 
to  relieve  these  acute  symptoms  only  serves  to  exacerbate  symptoms 
that are often misattributed by the patient and health care workers to 
cardiopulmonary  disorders.  An  unrevealing  evaluation  for  causes  of 
these symptoms often results in patients being anxious and fearful of 
additional attacks. It is important to note that anxiety disorders and 
panic  attacks  are  not  synonymous  with  hyperventilation.  Anxiety 
disorders can be both an initiating and sustaining factor in the patho-
genesis of chronic hyperventilation, but these are not necessary for the 
development of chronic hypocapnia.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Respiratory  symptoms  associated  with  acute  hyperventilation  can  be 
the initial manifestation of systemic illnesses such as diabetic ketoaci-
dosis.  Causes  of  acute  hyperventilation  need  to  be  excluded  before  a 
diagnosis of chronic hyperventilation is considered. Arterial blood gas 
sampling that demonstrates a compensated respiratory alkalosis with a 
near normal pH, low Paco2, and low calculated bicarbonate is neces-
sary to confirm chronic hyperventilation. Other causes of respiratory 
alkalosis, such as mild asthma, need to be diagnosed and treated before 

chronic hyperventilation can be considered. A high index of suspicion 
is required as increased minute ventilation can be difficult to detect on 
physical examination. Once chronic hyperventilation is established, a 
sustained 10% increase in alveolar ventilation is enough to perpetuate 
hypocapnia. This increase can be accomplished with subtle changes in 
the respiratory pattern, such as occasional sigh breaths or yawning 2–3 
times per min.

TREATMENT
Hyperventilation

There are few well-controlled treatment studies of chronic hyper-
ventilation owing to its diverse features and the lack of a universally 
accepted  diagnostic  process.  Clinicians  often  spend  considerable 
time  identifying  initiating  factors,  excluding  alternative  diagno-
ses,  and  discussing  the  patient’s  concerns  and  fears.  In  some 
patients,  reassurance  and  frank  discussion  about  hyperventilation 
can be liberating. Identifying and eliminating habits that perpetuate 
hypocapnia,  such  as  frequent  yawning  or  sigh  breathing,  can  be 
helpful.  Some  evidence  suggests  that  breathing  exercises  and  dia-
phragmatic retraining may be beneficial for some patients. The evi-
dence for using medications to treat hyperventilation is scant. Beta 
blockers may be helpful in patients with sympathetically mediated 
symptoms such as palpitations and tremors.

297 Sleep Apnea

Andrew Wellman, Daniel J. Gottlieb,  
Susan Redline

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA) are both 
classified  as  sleep-related  breathing  disorders.  OSA  and  CSA  share 
some risk factors and physiologic bases but also have unique features. 
Each disorder is associated with impaired ventilation during sleep and 
disruption  of  sleep,  and  each  diagnosis  requires  careful  elicitation  of 
the  patient’s  history,  physical  examination,  and  physiologic  testing. 
OSA,  the  more  common  disorder,  causes  daytime  sleepiness  and 
impaired daily function. It is a cause of hypertension and is strongly 
associated with cardiovascular disease in adults and behavioral prob-
lems in children. CSA is less common and may occur alone or in com-
bination with OSA. It can occur as a primary condition, as a response

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory Systemto  high  altitude,  or  secondary  to  a  medical  condition  (such  as  heart 
failure) or medication (such as opioids). Patients with CSA often report 
frequent awakenings and daytime fatigue and are at increased risk for 
heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
 ■ OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA/HYPOPNEA 
SYNDROME
Definition  OSA is defined on the basis of nocturnal and daytime 
symptoms as well as sleep study findings. Diagnosis requires the patient 
to have (1) either symptoms of nocturnal breathing disturbances (snor-
ing,  snorting,  gasping,  or  breathing  pauses  during  sleep)  or  daytime 
sleepiness or fatigue that occurs despite sufficient opportunity to sleep 
and  is  unexplained  by  other  medical  problems;  and  (2)  five  or  more 
episodes  of  obstructive  apnea  or  hypopnea  per  hour  of  sleep  (the 
apnea-hypopnea  index  [AHI],  calculated  as  the  number  of  episodes 
divided by the number of hours of sleep) documented during a sleep 
study. OSA also may be diagnosed in the absence of symptoms if the 
AHI is ≥15 episodes/h. Each episode of apnea or hypopnea represents a 
reduction in breathing for at least 10 s and commonly results in a ≥3% 
drop in oxygen saturation or a brain cortical arousal. OSA severity can 
be characterized by the frequency of breathing disturbances (AHI), the 
amount  of  oxyhemoglobin  desaturation  with  respiratory  events,  the 
duration of apneas and hypopneas, the degree of sleep fragmentation, 
and the level of reported daytime sleepiness or functional impairment.

Pathophysiology  During  inspiration,  intraluminal  pharyngeal 
pressure becomes increasingly negative, creating a “suctioning” force. 
Because the pharyngeal airway has no fixed bone or cartilage, airway 
patency  is  dependent  on  the  stabilizing  influence  of  the  pharyngeal 
dilator  muscles.  Although  these  muscles  are  continuously  activated 
during wakefulness, neuromuscular output declines with sleep onset. 
In patients with a collapsible airway, the reduction in neuromuscular 
output results in transient episodes of pharyngeal collapse (manifest-
ing as an “apnea”) or near collapse (manifesting as a “hypopnea”). The 
episodes of collapse are typically terminated when ventilatory reflexes 
are activated and cause arousal, thus stimulating an increase in neuro-
muscular activity and opening of the airway. The airway may collapse 
at different sites, such as the soft palate (most common), tongue base, 
lateral  pharyngeal  walls,  and/or  epiglottis  (Fig.  297-1).  OSA  may  be 
most  severe  during  rapid  eye  movement  (REM)  sleep,  when  neuro-
muscular output to the skeletal muscles is particularly low, and in the 
supine position due to gravitational forces.

Individuals  with  a  small  pharyngeal  lumen  require  relatively  high 
levels of neuromuscular activation to maintain patency during wake-
fulness  and  thus  are  predisposed  to  airway  collapse  following  the 
normal  sleep-related  reduction  in  pharyngeal  muscle  activity  during 
sleep. The airway lumen may be narrowed by enlargement of soft tissue 
structures (tongue, palate, and uvula) due to fat deposition, increased 
lymphoid tissue, or genetic variation. Craniofacial factors such as man-
dibular  retroposition  or  micrognathia,  reflecting  genetic  variation  or 
developmental influences, also can reduce lumen dimensions. In addi-
tion, lung volumes influence the caudal traction on the pharynx and 
consequently the stiffness of the pharyngeal wall. Accordingly, low lung 
volume in the recumbent position, which is particularly pronounced in 
the obese, contributes to collapse (less caudal traction). A high degree 
of  nasal  resistance  (e.g.,  due  to  nasal  septal  deviation  or  polyps)  can 
contribute to airway collapse by reducing intraluminal pressure down-
stream  in  the  pharynx.  High-level  nasal  resistance  also  may  trigger 
mouth opening during sleep, which breaks the seal between the tongue 
and the palate and allows the tongue to fall posteriorly and occlude the 
airway.

Pharyngeal  muscle  activation  is  integrally  linked  to  ventilatory 
drive. Thus, factors related to ventilatory control, particularly ventila-
tory sensitivity, arousal threshold, and neuromuscular responses to car-
bon dioxide (CO2), contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA. A buildup 
in CO2 during sleep activates both the diaphragm and the pharyngeal 
muscles.  Pharyngeal  activation  stiffens  the  upper  airway  and  can 
counteract inspiratory suction pressure and maintain airway patency 
to an extent that depends on the anatomic predisposition to collapse. 
However, pharyngeal collapse can occur when the ventilatory control 
system  is  overly  sensitive  to  CO2,  with  resultant  wide  fluctuations  in 
ventilation,  ventilatory  drive,  and  upper  airway  stiffness.  Moreover, 
increasing levels of CO2 during sleep result in central nervous system 
arousal, causing the individual to move from a deeper to a lighter level 
of  sleep  or  to  awaken.  A  low  arousal  threshold  (i.e.,  awakening  to  a 
low level of CO2 or ventilatory drive) can preempt the CO2-mediated 
process of pharyngeal muscle compensation and prevent airway stabi-
lization. A high arousal threshold, conversely, may prevent appropriate 
termination  of  apneas,  prolonging  apnea  duration  and  exacerbating 
oxyhemoglobin  desaturation.  Finally,  any  impairment  in  the  ability 
of the muscles to compensate during sleep can contribute to collapse 
of the pharynx. The relative contributions of risk factors vary among 
individuals. Approaches to the measurement of these factors in clinical 
settings, with consequent enhancement of “personalized” therapeutic 
interventions, are being actively investigated.

Risk  Factors  and  Prevalence  The  major  risk  factors  for  OSA 
are  obesity,  male  sex,  and  older  age.  Additional  risk  factors  include 
mandibular retrognathia and micrognathia, a positive family history of 
OSA, sedentary lifestyle, genetic syndromes that reduce upper airway 
patency (e.g., Down syndrome, Treacher-Collins syndrome), adenoton-
sillar hypertrophy (especially in children), menopause (in women), and 
various endocrine syndromes (e.g., acromegaly, hypothyroidism).

Approximately  40–60%  of  cases  of  OSA  are  attributable  to  excess 
weight. Obesity predisposes to OSA through the narrowing effects of 
upper airway fat on the pharyngeal lumen. Obesity also reduces chest 
wall  compliance  and  decreases  lung  volumes,  resulting  in  a  loss  of 
caudal  traction  on  upper  airway  structures.  Obese  individuals  are  at 
a fourfold or greater risk for OSA than their normal-weight counter-
parts. A 10% weight gain is associated with a >30% increase in AHI. 
Even  modest  weight  loss  or  weight  gain  can  influence  the  risk  and 
severity of OSA. However, the absence of obesity does not exclude this 
diagnosis.

The prevalence of OSA is twofold higher among men than among 
women. Factors that predispose men to OSA include android pattern 
of  obesity  (resulting  in  upper-airway  and  abdominal  fat  deposition) 
and  relatively  greater  pharyngeal  length,  which  increases  collapsibil-
ity.  Premenopausal  women  are  relatively  protected  from  OSA  by  the 
influence  of  sex  hormones  on  ventilatory  drive.  The  decline  in  sex 
difference in older age reflects an increased OSA prevalence in women 
after menopause. The pathogenesis and presentation of OSA also differ 

HPIM21e_Part7_p2131-p2216.indd   2205

20/01/22   6:21 PM

 
 
2206 in men and women: compared to men, women have a lower arousal 
threshold and less neuromuscular collapsibility. Women tend to have 
shorter  duration  of  apneas  and  apneas  that  occur  predominantly  in 
REM  sleep.  Failure  to  recognize  these  differences  can  contribute  to 
underrecognition of OSA in women.

Variations  in  craniofacial  morphology  that  reduce  the  size  of  the 
posterior airway space increase OSA risk. The contribution of skeletal 
structural features to OSA is most evident in nonobese patients. Iden-
tification  of  features  such  as  retrognathia  can  influence  therapeutic 
decision-making.

OSA has a strong genetic basis, as evidenced by its significant famil-
ial aggregation and heritability. For a first-degree relative of a patient 
with  OSA,  the  odds  of  having  OSA  is  approximately  twofold  higher 
than  that  of  someone  without  an  affected  relative.  Several  genetic 
variants have been associated with prevalence of OSA or with related 
traits, such as the frequency of apneas and hypopneas, the duration of 
respiratory events, and degree of overnight levels of hypoxemia.

OSA prevalence varies with age, from 5 to 15% among middle-aged 
adults  to  >20%  among  elderly  individuals,  although  in  a  majority  of 
affected  adults,  the  disorder  is  undiagnosed.  There  is  a  peak  due  to 
lymphoid  hypertrophy  among  children  between  the  ages  of  3  and  
8 years; with airway growth and lymphoid tissue regression during later 
childhood, prevalence declines. Then, as obesity prevalence increases 
in adolescence and adulthood, OSA prevalence again increases.

The  prevalence  of  OSA  is  especially  high  among  patients  with 
certain  medical  conditions,  including  diabetes  mellitus,  hyperten-
sion, and atrial fibrillation. Individuals of East Asian ancestry appear 
to  be  at  increased  risk  of  OSA  at  relatively  low  levels  of  body  mass 
index,  reflecting  the  greater  influence  of  craniofacial  risk  factors.  In 
the  United  States,  African  Americans,  especially  children  and  young 
adults, are at higher risk for OSA than their white counterparts.

Course of the Disorder  The precise onset of OSA is usually hard 
to  identify.  A  person  may  snore  for  many  years,  often  beginning  in 
childhood,  before  OSA  is  identified.  Weight  gain  may  precipitate  an 
increase in symptoms, which in turn may lead the patient to pursue an 
evaluation. OSA may become less severe with weight loss, particularly 
after bariatric surgery. In adults, there is a gradual increase in AHI with 
age, although marked increases and decreases in the AHI are uncom-
mon unless accompanied by weight change.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome

An evaluation for OSA should be considered in patients with symp-
toms of OSA and one or more risk factors. Screening also should 
be  considered  in  patients  who  report  symptoms  consistent  with 
OSA and who are at high risk for OSA-related morbidities, such as 
hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  cardiac  and  cerebrovascular 
diseases. 
SYMPTOMS AND HISTORY
When possible, a sleep history should be obtained with assistance 
from  a  bed  partner  or  household  member.  Snoring  is  the  most 
common complaint; however, its absence does not exclude the diag-
nosis,  as  pharyngeal  collapse  may  occur  without  tissue  vibration. 
Gasping or snorting during sleep may also be reported, reflecting 
termination of individual apneas with abrupt airway opening. Dys-
pnea is unusual, and its absence generally distinguishes OSA from 
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, nocturnal asthma, and acid reflux 
with laryngospasm. Patients also may describe frequent awakening 
or  sleep  disruption,  which  is  more  common  among  women  and 
older  adults.  The  most  common  daytime  symptom  is  excessive 
daytime sleepiness, identified by a history of difficulty maintaining 
alertness or involuntary periods of dozing. However, many women 
preferentially report fatigue rather than sleepiness. Other symptoms 
include a dry mouth, nocturnal heartburn, diaphoresis of the chest 
and  neck,  nocturia,  morning  headaches,  trouble  concentrating, 

irritability, and mood disturbances. Insomnia, which is common in 
the general population, may coexist with OSA. Although difficulty 
falling  sleep  is  rarely  caused  by  OSA,  awakening  at  apnea  termi-
nation  may  cause  difficulty  maintaining  sleep,  a  symptom  more 
likely to be reported by women than by men, and often responds 
to treatment of OSA. Several questionnaires that evaluate snoring 
frequency, self-reported apneas, and daytime sleepiness can facili-
tate OSA screening. The predictive ability of a questionnaire can be 
enhanced by a consideration of whether the patient is male or has 
risk factors such as obesity or hypertension. 

PHYSICAL FINDINGS
Physical findings often reflect the etiologic factors for the disorder 
as  well  as  comorbid  conditions,  particularly  vascular  disease.  On 
examination, patients may exhibit hypertension and regional (cen-
tral) obesity, as indicated by a large waist and neck circumference. 
The oropharynx may reveal a small orifice with crowding due to an 
enlarged  tongue,  a  low-lying  soft  palate  with  a  bulky  uvula,  large 
tonsils,  a  high-arched  palate,  or  micro-/retrognathia.  Since  nasal 
resistance  can  increase  the  propensity  to  pharyngeal  collapse,  the 
nasal cavity should be inspected for polyps, septal deviation, allergic 
rhinitis, and other signs of obstruction. Because patients with heart 
failure are at increased risk for both OSA and CSA, a careful cardiac 
examination should be conducted to detect possible left- or right-
sided  cardiac  dysfunction.  Evidence  of  cor  pulmonale  suggests  a 
comorbid  cardiopulmonary  condition;  OSA  alone  is  not  thought 
to  cause  right-heart  failure.  A  neurologic  evaluation  is  needed  to 
evaluate for conditions such as neuromuscular and cerebrovascular 
diseases, which increase OSA risk. 

LABORATORY FINDINGS 
Diagnostic Findings  Since symptoms and signs do not accurately 
predict the severity of sleep-related breathing disturbances, specific 
diagnosis  and  categorization  of  OSA  severity  requires  objective 
measurement of breathing during sleep. The gold standard for diag-
nosis  of  OSA  is  an  overnight  polysomnogram  (PSG).  A  negative 
in-laboratory PSG usually rules out OSA. However, false-negative 
studies  can  result  from  night-to-night  variation  in  OSA  severity, 
particularly if there was insufficient REM sleep or less supine sleep 
during testing than is typical for the patient. Home sleep tests that 
record  only  respiratory  and  cardiac  channels  are  commonly  used 
as  a  cost-effective  means  for  diagnosing  OSA.  However,  a  home 
study may yield a false-negative result if sleep time is not accurately 
estimated or in individuals experiencing hypopneas with arousals 
rather  than  oxyhemoglobin  desaturation.  Therefore,  if  there  is  a 
high  prior  probability  of  OSA,  a  negative  home  study  should  be 
followed by PSG.

The key physiologic information collected during a sleep study 
for  OSA  assessment  includes  measurement  of  breathing  (changes 
in  airflow,  respiratory  excursion),  oxygenation  (hemoglobin  oxy-
gen  saturation),  body  position,  and  cardiac  rhythm.  In  addition, 
PSGs  and  some  home  sleep  studies  measure  sleep  continuity  and 
sleep  stages  (by  electroencephalography,  chin  electromyography, 
electro-oculography, and actigraphy), leg movements, and snoring 
intensity.  This  information  is  used  to  quantify  the  frequency  and 
subtypes  of  abnormal  respiratory  events  during  sleep  as  well  as 
associated changes in oxygen hemoglobin saturation, arousals, and 
sleep stage distributions. Tables 297-1 and 297-2 define the respi-
ratory events scored and the severity guidelines employed during a 
sleep study. Fig. 297-2 shows examples of sleep-related respiratory 
events. A typical sleep study report provides quantitative data such 
as the AHI (number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep) 
and  the  profile  of  oxygen  saturation  over  the  night  (mean,  nadir, 
time  at  low  levels).  Reports  may  also  include  the  respiratory  dis-
turbance  index,  which  includes  the  number  of  respiratory  effort–
related  arousals  in  addition  to  the  AHI.  In-laboratory  PSG  also 
quantifies sleep latency (time from “lights off ” to first sleep onset), 
the  frequency  of  periodic  limb  movements  during  sleep,  sleep

•	 Apnea: Cessation of airflow for ≥10 s during sleep, accompanied by:
•	 Persistent respiratory effort (obstructive apneas, Fig. 297-2A), or
•	 Absence of respiratory effort (central apneas, Fig. 297-2B)

•	 Hypopnea: A ≥30% reduction in airflow for at least 10 s during sleep that is 
accompanied by either a ≥3% desaturation or an arousal (Fig. 297-2C)

•	 Respiratory effort–related arousal (RERA): Partial obstruction that does not 

meet the criteria for hypopnea but provides evidence of increasing inspiratory 
effort (usually through pleural pressure monitoring) punctuated by an arousal 
(Fig. 297-2D)

•	 Flow-limited breath: A partially obstructed breath, typically within a hypopnea 
or RERA, identified by a flattened or “scooped-out” inspiratory flow shape 
(Fig. 297-3)

efficiency (percentage of time asleep relative to time in bed), arousal 
index (number of cortical arousals per hour of sleep), and time in 
each sleep stage. These metrics can further characterize the severity 
of  OSA,  which  is  associated  with  an  increased  arousal  index,  low 
sleep  efficiency,  and  a  reduction  of  time  in  deep  (stage  N3)  and 
REM sleep and increase in light (stage N1) sleep. The detection of 
autonomic  responses  to  apneas  and  hypopneas,  such  as  surges  in 
blood pressure, changes in heart rate, and abnormalities in cardiac 
rhythm, also provides relevant information on OSA severity. 
Other  Laboratory  Findings  Various  imaging  studies,  including 
cephalometric radiography, upper airway MRI and CT, and fiber-
optic endoscopy, can be used to identify anatomic risk factors for 
OSA. While these may be useful for planning surgical interventions, 
they  are  not  indicated  in  the  routine  evaluation  of  OSA.  Cardiac 
testing  may  yield  evidence  of  impaired  systolic  or  diastolic  ven-
tricular  function  or  abnormal  cardiac  structure.  Overnight  blood 
pressure monitoring often displays a “nondipping” pattern (absence 
of  the  typical  10%  fall  of  blood  pressure  during  sleep  compared 
to  wakefulness).  Arterial  blood  gas  measurements  made  during 
wakefulness are usually normal. Waking hypoxemia or hypercarbia 
suggests  coexisting  cardiopulmonary  disease  or  hypoventilation 
syndromes.  Patients  with  severe  nocturnal  hypoxemia  may  have 
elevated hemoglobin values. A multiple sleep latency test or a main-
tenance of wakefulness test can be useful in quantifying sleepiness 
and helping to distinguish OSA from narcolepsy.

Health  Consequences  and  Comorbidities  OSA  is  the  most 
common medical cause of daytime sleepiness and negatively influences 
quality  of  life.  It  is  also  strongly  associated  with  cardiac,  cerebrovas-
cular, and metabolic disorders and with premature death. This broad 
range of health effects is attributable to the impact of sleep fragmen-
tation, cortical arousal, and intermittent hypoxemia and hypercapnia 
on vascular, cardiac, metabolic, and neurologic functions. OSA-related 
respiratory events stimulate sympathetic overactivity, leading to acute 
blood  pressure  surges  during  sleep  and  nocturnal  as  well  as  daytime 
hypertension. OSA-related hypoxemia also stimulates release of acute-
phase  proteins  and  reactive  oxygen  species  that  exacerbate  insulin 
resistance  and  lipolysis  and  cause  an  augmented  prothrombotic  and 
proinflammatory  state.  Inspiratory  effort  against  an  occluded  airway 
causes  large  intrathoracic  negative  pressure  swings,  altering  cardiac 
preload and afterload and resulting in cardiac remodeling and reduced 
cardiac function. Hypoxemia and sympathetic-parasympathetic imbal-
ance  also  may  cause  electrical  remodeling  of  the  heart  and  myocyte 
injury.
HYPERTENSION  OSA can raise blood pressure to prehypertensive and 
hypertensive ranges, increase the prevalence of a nondipping overnight 
blood pressure pattern, and increase the risk of uncontrolled and resis-
tant hypertension. Elevations in blood pressure are due to augmented 
sympathetic  nervous  system  activation  as  well  as  alterations  in  the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and fluid balance. Treatment of 
OSA with nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has 
been shown to reduce 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. Although the 
overall  impact  of  CPAP  on  blood  pressure  levels  is  relatively  modest 
(averaging  2–4  mmHg),  larger  improvements  are  observed  among 
patients who have a high AHI, report daytime sleepiness, or have resis-
tant hypertension.
CARDIOVASCULAR,  CEREBROVASCULAR,  AND  METABOLIC  DISEASES  
Among the most serious health consequences of OSA may be its impact 
on  cardiac  and  metabolic  functions.  Strong  epidemiologic  evidence 
indicates that OSA significantly increases the risk of coronary artery dis-
ease, heart failure with and without reduced ejection fraction, atrial and 
ventricular  arrhythmias,  atherosclerosis  and  coronary  artery  disease, 
stroke, and diabetes. Treatment of OSA has been shown to reduce sev-
eral markers of cardiovascular risk and improve insulin resistance and, 
in uncontrolled studies, is associated with a decreased recurrence rate of 
atrial fibrillation. Recent randomized clinical trials, however, have failed 
to  demonstrate  that  OSA  treatment  with  CPAP  reduces  cardiac  event 
rates or prolongs survival. These outcomes may reflect exclusion from 
these  trials  of  patients  with  excessive  sleepiness,  as  there  is  evidence 
that sleepy patients may have the greatest OSA-related cardiovascular 
risk.  Limited  adherence  to  treatment  among  trial  participants  or  the 
widespread use of other effective secondary prevention measures, such 
as beta blockade, antiplatelet agents, and lipid-lowering therapy, may 
also limit the impact of CPAP on cardiovascular risk.
SLEEPINESS  More than 50% of patients with moderate to severe OSA 
report daytime sleepiness. Patients with OSA symptoms have a twofold 
increased  risk  of  occupational  accidents.  Individuals  with  elevated 
AHIs  are  involved  in  motor  vehicle  crashes  approximately  two  to 
three times as often as persons with normal AHIs. Randomized con-
trolled trials have shown that treatment of OSA with CPAP alleviates 
sleepiness as measured by either questionnaire or objective testing in 

patients with both mild and more severe disease. However, the degree 
of improvement varies widely. Residual sleepiness may be due to sev-
eral  factors,  including  suboptimal  treatment  adherence,  insufficient 
sleep  time,  other  sleep  disorders,  or  prior  hypoxic-mediated  damage 
in brain areas involved in alertness. Moreover, visceral adipose tissue, 
which is present in higher amounts in patients with OSA, releases som-
nogenic cytokines that may contribute to sleepiness. Thus, even after 
treatment,  it  is  important  to  assess  and  monitor  patients  for  residual 
sleepiness  and  to  optimize  treatment  adherence,  improve  sleep  pat-
terns,  and  identify  other  disorders  that  may  contribute  to  sleepiness. 
Careful  and  supervised  use  of  alerting  agents  may  be  appropriate  as 
adjunctive treatment in patients in whom sleepiness does not respond 
to CPAP alone.
QUALITY  OF  LIFE  AND  MOOD  Reductions  in  health-related  quality 
of life are common in patients with OSA, with the largest decrements 
observed in scales that measure physical functioning and energy levels. 
Work-related productivity also has been shown to improve in patients 
with  moderate  to  severe  OSA  treated  with  CPAP.  Numerous  studies, 
including  a  large-scale  trial  of  minimally  symptomatic  patients,  have 
shown that treatment with CPAP can improve these patient-reported 
outcomes.  Depressive  symptoms,  in  particular  somatic  symptoms 
(irritability,  fatigue,  lack  of  energy),  are  commonly  reported  in  OSA 
and improve with CPAP.

TREATMENT
Obstructive Sleep Apnea

A comprehensive approach to the management of OSA is needed 
to  reduce  risk  factors  and  comorbidities.  The  clinician  should 
seek to identify and address lifestyle and behavioral factors as well 
as  comorbidities  that  may  be  exacerbating  OSA.  As  appropriate, 
treatment  should  aim  to  reduce  weight;  optimize  sleep  duration 
(7–9 h); regulate sleep schedules (with similar bedtimes and wake 
times across the week); encourage the patient to avoid sleeping in 
the  supine  position;  treat  nasal  allergies;  increase  physical  activ-
ity; eliminate alcohol ingestion (which impairs pharyngeal muscle 
activity) within 3 h of bedtime; and minimize use of opiate med-
ications.  Sedative  hypnotic  medications  have  inconsistent  effects 
on OSA but should be avoided in most patients with moderate to 
severe OSA. Patients should be counseled to avoid drowsy driving.
CPAP  is  the  standard  medical  therapy  with  the  highest  level 
of  evidence  for  efficacy.  Delivered  through  a  nasal  or  nasal-oral 
mask, CPAP works as a mechanical splint to hold the airway open, 
thus maintaining airway patency during sleep. An overnight CPAP 
titration  study  can  determine  the  optimal  pressure  setting  that 
reduces  the  number  of  apneas/hypopneas  during  sleep,  improves 
gas  exchange,  and  reduces  arousals;  however,  the  use  of  “auto- 
titrating”  CPAP  devices  used  in  home  settings  has  eliminated  the 
need for titration sleep studies in many patients. Rates of adherence 
to CPAP treatment are highly variable (average, 50–80%) and may 
be  improved  with  support  by  a  skilled  health  care  team  who  can 
address side effects, help the patient “problem solve,” and provide 
motivational  education  (Table  297-3).  Despite  the  limitations  of

PART 7Disorders of the Respiratory SystemCPAP, controlled studies have demonstrated its beneficial effect on 
alertness,  mood,  quality  of  life,  work-related  productivity,  blood 
pressure, and insulin sensitivity. Uncontrolled studies also indicate 
a favorable effect on cardiovascular outcomes, cardiac ejection frac-
tion, atrial fibrillation recurrence, and mortality risk.

Oral appliances for OSA work by advancing the mandible, thus 
opening the airway by repositioning the lower jaw and pulling the 
tongue forward. These devices generally work better when custom-
ized  for  patient  use;  maximal  adaptation  can  take  several  weeks. 
Efficacy  studies  show  that  these  devices  can  reduce  the  AHI  by 
≥50%  in  two-thirds  of  individuals,  although  these  data  are  based 
largely  on  patients  with  mild  OSA.  Some  patients  with  moderate 
or severe OSA respond to oral appliances as well, although no con-
sistent  predictors  of  success  have  been  identified  in  these  groups, 
and  thus,  follow-up  sleep  testing  is  recommended.  Side  effects  of 
oral  appliances  include  temporomandibular  joint  pain  and  tooth 
movement; thus, they require that the patient have adequate dental 
and periodontal structures. Oral appliances are most often used for 
treating patients with mild/moderate OSA or patients who do not 
tolerate CPAP. However, as some patients are more adherent to oral 
appliances than to CPAP, these devices are under investigation for 
treatment of more severe disease.

Upper airway surgery for OSA is less efficacious than CPAP and 
is  mostly  reserved  for  the  treatment  of  patients  who  snore,  have 
mild  OSA,  or  cannot  tolerate  CPAP.  Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty 
(removal of the uvula and the margin of the soft palate) is the most 
commonly performed surgery for OSA and, although results vary 
greatly, is generally less successful than treatment with oral appli-
ances. Upper airway surgery is less effective in severe OSA and in 
obese patients. Success rates may be higher for multilevel surgery 
(involving more than one site/structure) performed by an experi-
enced surgeon, but the selection of patients is an important factor 
and relies on careful targeting of culprit areas for surgical resection. 
Bariatric surgery is an option for obese patients with OSA and can 
improve  not  only  OSA  but  also  other  obesity-associated  health 
conditions.  Other  procedures  that  can  decrease  snoring  but  have 
minimal effects on OSA include injection of a hardening agent to 
the  soft  palate  (resulting  in  stiffening),  radiofrequency  ablation, 
laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty, and palatal implants.

Upper  airway  neurostimulation  is  a  recently  tested  alternative 
treatment for OSA. Unilateral stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve 
through  a  surgically  implanted  device  was  shown  to  significantly 
decrease the AHI and improve a number of patient-reported out-
comes, such as sleepiness and quality of life, for a duration of at least 
5 years after treatment in carefully selected patients. This therapy 
is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or fail CPAP therapy. 
Current inclusion criteria are moderate to severe OSA (AHI 15–65), 
BMI <32 kg/m2, and absence of complete concentric collapse at the 
level of the velum documented by awake and drug-induced endos-
copy  (a  predictor  of  response  to  surgery).  Additional  research  is 
underway to further evaluate longer-term effectiveness and poten-
tial utility of this treatment in other patient groups.

Supplemental oxygen can improve oxygen saturation, but there is 
little evidence that it improves OSA symptoms or the AHI in unse-
lected patients. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of 
supplemental oxygen on blood pressure in patients with OSA. 

CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA
CSA, which is less common than OSA, may occur in isolation or, 
more often, in combination with obstructive events in the form of 
“mixed” apneas. CSA is often caused by an increased sensitivity to 
Pco2,  which  leads  to  an  unstable  breathing  pattern  that  manifests 
as hyperventilation alternating with apnea. A prolonged circulation 
delay between the pulmonary capillaries and carotid chemorecep-
tors  is  also  a  contributing  cause;  thus,  individuals  with  conges-
tive  heart  failure  are  at  risk  for  CSA.  With  prolonged  circulation 
delay, there is a crescendo-decrescendo breathing pattern known as 
Cheyne-Stokes breathing (Fig. 297–2B). Other risk factors for CSA 
include opioid medications (which appear to have a dose-dependent 

effect  on  CSA)  and  hypoxia  (e.g.,  breathing  at  high  altitude).  In 
some individuals, CPAP—particularly at high pressures—seems to 
induce central apnea; this condition is referred to as complex sleep 
apnea or treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. Rarely, CSA may 
be caused by blunted chemosensitivity due to congenital disorders 
(congenital central hypoventilation syndrome) or acquired factors. 
CSA  is  an  independent  risk  factor  for  the  development  of  both 
heart failure and atrial fibrillation, possibly related to elevations in 
sympathetic nervous system activity that accompany this disorder; 
alternatively, CSA may be an early marker of subclinical myocardial 
dysfunction. Patients with CSA may report symptoms of frequent 
awakenings as well as daytime fatigue. Treatment of CSA is difficult 
and  depends  on  the  underlying  cause.  Limited  data  suggest  that 
supplemental  oxygen  can  reduce  the  frequency  of  central  apneas, 
particularly  in  patients  with  hypoxemia,  and  ongoing  clinical  tri-
als are further evaluating supplemental oxygen for use in patients 
with heart failure and CSA. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is treated by 
optimizing therapy for heart failure. At this time, there is no good 
evidence  that  CPAP,  including  adaptive  servoventilation  (a  form 
of  ventilatory  support  that  attempts  to  regularize  the  breathing 
pattern), improves health outcomes in patients with Cheyne-Stokes 
breathing without OSA, and in fact, it may be detrimental in those 
with heart failure associated with reduced ejection fraction.

298 Lung Transplantation

Hilary J. Goldberg, Hari R. Mallidi

 ■ END-STAGE LUNG DISEASE AND INDICATIONS 
FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTATION
For the purpose of lung allocation score (LAS) prioritization for organ 
allocation,  the  United  Network  for  Organ  Sharing  (UNOS)  divides 
advanced lung disease diagnoses into four categories: (A) obstructive 
lung disease (including non-cystic fibrosis-related bronchiectasis and 
obliterative bronchiolitis), (B) pulmonary vascular disease, (C) cystic 
fibrosis, and (D) restrictive lung disease. Historically, obstructive lung 
disease was the most common indication for transplantation, but since 
the  implementation  of  the  LAS  system,  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibro-
sis  (IPF),  the  most  common  restrictive  lung  disease,  has  become  an 
increasingly frequent indication for transplantation. Prior to the era of 
antifibrotic therapy, the average life expectancy from the time of diag-
nosis of IPF was 3–5 years, making patients with this disease the cohort 
to experience most clearly a survival benefit from lung transplantation. 
As  a  result,  the  LAS  system  prioritizes  patients  with  IPF.  Similarly, 
patients who experience secondary effects of their lung disease, includ-
ing pulmonary hypertension, right heart dysfunction, and hypercarbia, 
are prioritized for allocation and should be considered for referral for 
transplant evaluation irrespective of other markers of disease severity.

Generally, the trajectory of decline and evolution of disease are key 
indicators  of  the  appropriate  timing  for  referral  and  listing  for  lung 
transplantation,  rather  than  absolute  thresholds  of  disease  severity. 
However,  suggested  guidelines  for  referral  have  been  elucidated  for 
specific disease states. For example, in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease,  the  most  common  obstructive  lung  disease  for  which  trans-
plantation  is  considered,  the  Body-Mass  Index,  Airflow  Obstruction, 
Dyspnea,  and  Exercise  Capacity  (BODE)  Index  is  often  used  as  a 
marker of disease severity, with an index of 5 an appropriate indication 
for referral for evaluation, and 7 for listing for transplantation. Other 
suggested  markers  for  transplant  consideration  in  obstructive  lung 
disease include pulmonary function test (PFT) data, such as a forced 
expiratory volume in 1 s of <25% predicted. The frequency and severity 
of exacerbations of disease should also be considered in determining 
the appropriate timing of referral.

With  the  marked  advances  in  medical  therapy  for  pulmonary 
vascular disease over the past decade, transplantation for pulmonary 
vascular  disease  has  become  less  frequent  but  is  still  an  important 
consideration  for  patients  who  progress  despite,  or  are  refractory  to, 
treatment. Functional assessments such as New York Heart Association 
class  III  or  IV  limitations  and  hemodynamic  measurements  such  as 
cardiac index <2 L/min per m2 would suggest consideration for evalua-
tion and listing. Patients with diagnoses generally poorly responsive to 
therapy such as pulmonary veno-occlusive disease should be referred 
early for evaluation.

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have historically been considered 
for  evaluation  when  the  FEV1  reaches  approximately  30%  predicted. 
However, with the exciting development of therapies targeting the CF 
transmembrane receptor, providers should keep in mind the potential 
for  improvement  in  pulmonary  function  after  treatment  initiation. 
Despite  this  potential  for  pharmacotherapeutic  response,  referral 
and  completion  of  testing  should  be  considered  so  that  patients  are 
prepared for listing should they fail to see improvement or experience 
worsening  of  disease  on  therapy.  Moreover,  patients  who  experience 
acceleration of acute exacerbation rate, recurrent hemoptysis, worsen-
ing functional and/or nutritional status, or colonization with resistant 
bacteria  should  also  be  assessed  for  transplantation  irrespective  of 
pulmonary function results.

Despite  treatment  progress  with  the  development  of  antifibrotic 
therapy  for  IPF  and  other  progressive  fibrosing  interstitial  lung  dis-
eases, these therapies do not reverse the disease but only slow the rate 
of lung function decline. Therefore, transplant referral for patients with 
IPF and other fibrosing lung diseases should still be considered at the 
time  of  diagnosis.  Forced  vital  capacity  <80%  predicted  or  diffusing 
capacity  for  carbon  monoxide  <40%  predicted,  failure  to  respond  to 
medical therapy, decline in pulmonary function tests on therapy, and 
functional  decline  are  additional  indications  for  transplant  consider-
ation in patients with other restrictive lung diseases.

 ■ CONTRAINDICATIONS TO LUNG 
TRANSPLANTATION
Absolute Contraindications  As experience with lung transplan-
tation increases, and as lung allocation policy prioritizes patients with 
higher acuity of disease and with diseases affecting older age groups, 
recipient selection criteria have become more liberal compared to prior 
eras. While published guidelines suggest absolute and relative contrain-
dications  to  transplantation,  these  criteria  are  in  constant  evolution, 
and each program ultimately establishes its own selection algorithms 
based upon clinical expertise, experience, program size and resources, 
and referral patterns.

Examples  of  absolute  contraindications  to  lung  transplantation 
(Table  298-1)  include  anatomic  and  technical  considerations  that 
would affect the ability to complete the transplant procedure, such as 
chest wall or spinal deformities or malacia of the large airways. Surgical 
input is critical in making such determinations. In addition, untreat-
able and/or irreversible organ dysfunction may preclude isolated lung 
transplantation.  Cirrhosis  of  the  liver,  uncorrectable  disease  of  the 
coronary  arteries  not  amenable  to  combined  surgical  intervention

during the transplant procedure, or other forms of uncorrectable ath-
erosclerotic or vascular disease may make transplantation too high risk 
for consideration. Renal dysfunction is of particular concern given the 
known nephrotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors, which are the mainstay 
of posttransplant immune suppression.

Relative Contraindications  Age  in  and  of  itself  is  typically  not 
a contraindication to transplantation at most centers. However, older 
patients with significant medical comorbidities may be at prohibitive 
risk for transplantation, and functional status and frailty may worsen in 
this setting. Published analyses of the Scientific Registry of Transplant 
Recipients,  a  comprehensive  database  of  transplant  outcomes,  have 
consistently  shown  that  functional  capacity,  as  assessed  by  6-minute 
walk distance, is inversely correlated with both wait list and posttrans-
plant mortality. As a result, most programs utilize some assessment of 
functional status as a criterion for transplant candidacy.

Frailty,  independent  of  walk  distance,  has  also  been  recognized 
increasingly  as  a  marker  of  poor  outcome  after  lung  transplantation, 
and can be assessed using a number of instruments, including the Short 
Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP), 
and  others.  Most  studies  utilizing  these  instruments  have  been  con-
ducted at single centers. While both SPPB and FFP have been shown 
to  correlate  with  the  LAS,  FFP  has  a  stronger  correlation,  and  SPPB 
and  FFP  may  not  correlate  with  each  other.  Further  study  is  needed 
to  determine  prospectively  the  relationship  between  these  measures 
assessed in the pretransplant setting and posttransplant outcomes.

Patients with a history of malignancy are generally required to have 
experienced a period of remission prior to consideration for transplan-
tation. The necessary length of disease-free survival should be deter-
mined in the context of the type of malignancy, stage at diagnosis, and 
likelihood of recurrence, and often varies by program.

A  history  of  respiratory  infection  and  colonization  with  resistant 
organisms is of particular concern in the CF and bronchiectasis pop-
ulations,  although  it  could  affect  patients  with  any  advanced  lung

disease and a history of respiratory infection. Data on outcomes in the 
presence of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection are conflicting, 
but in general, patients who have demonstrated a response to an anti-
microbial regimen, even if colonized with resistant organisms, can be 
considered for transplantation. Burkholderia cepacia complex, another 
group  of  gram-negative  organisms  that  can  infect  patients  with  CF, 
also presents a unique concern for transplantation. Data show that B. 
cenocepacia (formerly known as Genomovar III) portends the highest 
risk posttransplant, often leading to bacteremia, abscess formation, and 
early mortality. B. dolosa and gladioli may cause similar posttransplant 
complications.  Patients  colonized  with  other  Burkholderia  species 
appear to have posttransplant outcomes comparable with the noncolo-
nized population, and, therefore, can be considered for transplantation. 
Published guidelines suggest that those programs offering transplanta-
tion to patients colonized with B. cenocepacia do so under a research 
structure and after a specific discussion of the risks of transplantation 
in  this  setting  with  the  patients.  Other  infectious  considerations  in 
lung  transplant  candidates  include  mycobacterial  infections,  partic-
ularly  with  rapidly  growing  organisms  such  as  M.  abscessus,  which 
can  lead  to  chronic,  refractory  infections  and  infections  of  the  chest 
wall. In the case of fungal infection, assessment of the pathogenicity of 
the organism, resistance patterns, and, in some cases, responsiveness 
to  pretransplant  treatment,  is  beneficial  in  determining  the  safety  of 
transplantation.

A history of viral infections such as hepatitis and human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) is generally not considered a contraindication 
to transplantation. Demonstration of adequate control of infection and 
responsiveness to therapy are important in preparation for transplanta-
tion, and development of a treatment plan that minimizes toxicity and 
drug interactions, in consultation with transplant pharmacy, should be 
completed prior to placement on the wait list. Collaborative assessment 
with  transplant  infectious  disease  experts  is  beneficial  whenever  the 
infectious history is a concern for transplant safety.

Nutritional status is another important element to assess in deter-
mining candidacy for lung transplantation. Nutritional status has been 
shown  to  have  a  U-shaped  relationship  with  transplant  outcomes, 
with increased mortality risk associated with both underweight (BMI 
<18) and obesity (specifically BMI >35). Consultation with nutritional 
experts may allow for modification of this risk prior to transplant. In 
some underweight patients, placement of an enteral feeding tube and 
initiation of enteral feedings may be considered.

Psychosocial assessment is also a key component of the evaluation of 
patients under consideration for lung transplantation, and a multidisci-
plinary approach with transplant social work, psychiatry, and financial 
care  coordination  is  often  helpful.  Assessment  for  and  optimization 
of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression, which can be 
exacerbated  in  the  setting  of  transplantation,  substance  abuse  disor-
ders,  and  compliance  with  medical  therapy  recommendations  are  all 
important  parts  of  the  pretransplant  evaluation.  Perioperative  pain 
management planning in the setting of medical therapy for opioid use 
disorder may require additional multidisciplinary input, but the need 
for this management plan alone should not preclude transplantation. 
Transplant  candidates  require  a  strong  support  system  given  their 
potential  posttransplant  care  needs.  Additionally,  confirmation  of 
insurance coverage for all phases of transplant care, expected medica-
tion copayments, and financial resources to support other expenses in 
the  setting  of  transplantation  should  be  completed  during  the  trans-
plant evaluation. Fundraising opportunities and subsidies for medica-
tions may need to be pursued in order to proceed safely with listing.

 ■ LUNG TRANSPLANT CANDIDATE MANAGEMENT
Lung transplant candidates need meticulous and exquisite medical care 
to ensure that they are in excellent condition at the time of transplant. 
Oxygen  is  prescribed  to  maintain  adequate  systemic  oxygenation  to 
allow for moderate physical activity and exertion. Patients should be 
enrolled in pulmonary rehabilitation programs, if available, and should 
continue to participate in daily physical exercises. Fluid management 
is important to consider and restriction of free water and salt intake is 
recommended.

Patients  with  pulmonary  vascular  disease  and  severe  pulmonary 
hypertension  awaiting  lung  transplantation  need  special  attention  to 
maintain  adequate  right  ventricular  function.  The  use  of  pulmonary 
vasodilator therapy is recommended and should not be stopped prior 
to  transplant.  Patients  who  develop  secondary  pulmonary  hyper-
tension  should  also  be  assessed  for  the  utility  of  direct  pulmonary 
vasodilator therapy. Periodic assessment of right ventricular function 
with echocardiography is recommended, and in patients with clearly 
worsening ventricular function, right heart catheterization and assess-
ment for responsiveness to short-acting vasodilator therapy should be 
considered.

In  restrictive  lung  disease  patients  awaiting  transplant,  consider-
ation  should  be  given  to  continuation  of  immune  modulators  and/
or  antifibrotic  therapy.  Studies  are  ongoing  to  determine  the  impact 
of antifibrotic therapy on posttransplant wound healing. Additionally, 
increased  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  can  occur  in  these  patients 
as the disease progresses, and acute exacerbations have been shown to 
be associated with severe acute decrease in right ventricular function. 
Steroids have been utilized in the management of acute exacerbations; 
however, the negative sequelae of chronic steroid use on wound healing 
is well established. Therefore, steroid use should be limited as much as 
possible, and if unavoidable, should be tapered rapidly.

Patients with CF can have pancreatic dysfunction leading to diffi-
culty in maintaining normal blood glucose levels; uncontrolled diabe-
tes mellitus can make the management of posttransplant blood glucose 
very  challenging.  Therefore,  optimization  of  diabetes  management 
should be pursued prior to transplantation.

Despite  optimal  medical  therapy,  the  underlying  disease  in  wait-
listed patients will almost always continue to worsen. Prioritization of 
patients awaiting lung transplant is determined by the LAS. The score 
is generated by giving weight to risk factors associated with predicted 
mortality while on the wait list while also accounting for the expected 
posttransplant survival of the patient. This composite score is then nor-
malized to generate a score between 0 and 100. The higher the score, 
the  more  prioritized  the  patient,  and  the  higher  the  probability  of  a 
suitable donor match for the recipient. The main factors that influence  
the LAS are the underlying diagnosis of the patient (such as restrictive 
lung  disease,  as  mentioned  above),  the  demographics  of  the  patient 
(gender  and  age),  and  the  patient’s  current  clinical  status.  The  more 
acutely  ill  the  patient  (the  patient’s  oxygen  requirements,  pulmonary 
hypertension,  use  of  invasive  support  systems  such  as  mechanical 
circulatory  support  or  ventilatory  support,  limited  mobility,  lack  of 
independence with activities of daily living), the higher the score. This 
results in a system of organ allocation that is most efficient at ensuring 
that the sickest patients receive the organs available. However, despite 
this prioritization strategy, patients continue to expire at a rate of 10–12 
patient deaths per 100 patient-years on the wait list. It is critical for the 
best  outcomes  in  these  patients  that  ongoing  clinical  assessment  and 
frequent updates of the LAS are routine aspects of their management.
A major consequence of improved efficiency in matching the sickest 
patients to the available pool of donors has been an increased use of 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices to bridge the 
most  critically  ill  patients  to  transplant.  Mechanical  circulatory  sup-
port with ECMO allows for patients to be potentially weaned from the 
ventilator, to maintain physical activity and ambulation, and to be in a 
state of greater robustness as they await transplant. The posttransplant 
survival  rate  of  patients  bridged  to  transplant  with  ECMO  is  lower 
than  patients  transplanted  without  the  need  for  ECMO  but  better 
than  patients  who  had  previously  been  transplanted  directly  from 
mechanical  ventilatory  support.  Furthermore,  with  improvements 
in  membrane  oxygenator  technology,  platform  miniaturization,  and 
improvements in cannula design, outcomes continue to improve.

 ■ DONOR CONSIDERATIONS
The  ideal  lung  donor  has  remained  constant  since  the  inception  of 
lung  transplantation  in  the  1980s  (Table  298-2).  A  donor  between 
25–40 years of age, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio >350, no smoking history, 
a  clear  chest  x-ray,  clean  bronchoscopy,  and  minimal  ischemic  time 
is  considered  the  ideal  donor;  however,  it  is  quite  rare  that  a  donor

meets all of these criteria for transplantation. In fact, the vast majority 
of donor lungs used for transplant fall outside these ideal lung donor 
criteria as established more than three decades ago. Donors must have 
irreversible  brain  injury,  and  the  majority  of  donors  are  brain  dead. 
Only 20% of all donors with brain death are suitable lung donors due to 
the development of severe neurogenic pulmonary edema and increased 
susceptibility of potential lung allografts to infection and injury.

Absolute  contraindications  to  lung  donation  include  radiographic 
evidence of chronic lung disease such as emphysema and pulmonary 
fibrosis. Other absolute contraindications include active malignancy, a 
donor history of severe asthma requiring multiple hospitalizations, and 
positive HIV status. Relative contraindications include older donor age, 
severe thoracic trauma with extensive pulmonary contusions, the pres-
ence of pulmonary hypertension, and prolonged donor hypotension or 
acute hypoxemia.

The standard lung donor evaluation includes a donor medical and 
social  history,  physical  examination,  and  laboratory  examination. 
Chest imaging is mandatory, as are arterial blood gases, bronchoscopy, 
and  serological  tests  for  cytomegalovirus  (CMV),  Epstein-Barr  virus 
(EBV), hepatitis B and C, HIV, toxoplasma, rapid plasma reagin, and 
herpes  simplex  virus.  The  presence  of  consolidation  and  atelectasis, 
while  not  absolute  contraindications  to  transplant,  are  often  difficult 
to  assess  with  noncontrast  radiographic  imaging  alone.  Ventilation 
parameters  must  be  evaluated  to  ensure  adequate  compliance  of  the 
donor  lungs,  with  peak  airway  pressures  <30  cmH2O  being  ideal. 
Direct  on-site  inspection  of  the  lungs  and  assessment  for  nodules, 
compliance,  and  full  expansion  are  the  final  necessary  steps  before 
acceptance of donor lungs for transplant.

More  recently,  there  has  been  an  expanded  use  of  allografts  from 
donors  after  cardiac  death  (DCD)  due  to  the  ability  to  rehabilitate 
donor  lungs  using  ex  vivo  lung  perfusion  (EVLP).  DCD  donors  are 
patients who present with irreversible brain injury but without overt 
brain  death.  The  potential  donor  allografts  are  often  exposed  to  a 
period of prolonged warm ischemia during the donation process; there 
has been a concern about early graft dysfunction after DCD donation. 
Steen and colleagues in Lund demonstrated that EVLP could be used 
to  assess  these  marginal  donors  prior  to  transplant.  The  landmark 
publication of the Normothermic Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion in Clinical 
Lung Transplantation trial in 2011 generated renewed interest in DCD 
lung donors. The group from the University of Toronto was also able 
to demonstrate that brain-dead donors with unacceptable donor lung 
parameters  could  be  rehabilitated  with  the  use  of  EVLP.  They  were 
able to salvage up to 50% of selected unsuitable donor lung allografts 
with the use of acellular normothermic hyperosmotic perfusion with 
excellent short-term outcomes.

Donor  Management  Brain  death  causes  severe  perturbations  in 
the potential donor lung allograft function. The development of severe 
pulmonary edema often accompanies brain death. The hemodynamic 
instability and neurogenic shock that can accompany brain death are 
also  major  stressors  on  the  preservation  of  donor  allograft  function. 
The primary goal of donor management is, therefore, the maintenance 
of  hemodynamic  stability  and  preservation  of  donor  lung  function. 
Judicious  fluid  resuscitation  and  avoidance  of  excessive  resuscitation 

should  be  employed.  Volume  replenishment  should  be  limited  to 
maintain  the  central  venous  pressure  between  5  and  8  mmHg.  In 
general, crystalloid fluid boluses are to be avoided. Diabetes insipidus 
is common in donors and requires the use of intravenous vasopressin 
to prevent excessive urine loss. In general, blood transfusions should 
be  avoided;  however,  if  necessary,  CMV-negative  and  leukocyte- 
filtered blood should be used whenever possible. Hypothermia should 
be avoided as it predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and metabolic 
acidosis.

Excessive  oxygen  delivery  should  be  minimized  to  prevent  free- 
radical  injury  to  the  potential  lung  allograft.  Positive  end-expiratory 
pressures on the ventilator should be maintained to avoid the develop-
ment of atelectasis. More recently, airway pressure release ventilation 
modes of ventilation have been utilized to preserve lung function and 
minimize barotrauma from prolonged ventilation.

 ■ PROCUREMENT OPERATION
Prior to incision, a thorough bronchoscopic evaluation is completed. 
The anatomy of the donor airways is defined. Any secretions that may 
be present are evacuated and the airways are examined to rule out the 
presence of any lesions or masses. The epithelial lining is inspected for 
evidence  of  excessive  friability  and  hemorrhage,  which  may  indicate 
significant  infection.  A  median  sternotomy  incision  is  employed  to 
access the chest for lung procurement. The pleural spaces are opened 
and both lungs are inspected, palpated, and gently recruited to evaluate 
for suspicious nodules, consolidation, and/or pulmonary infarction.

The  donor  is  systemically  heparinized,  and  the  main  pulmonary 
artery is cannulated. Fifteen minutes prior to initiation of the explant, 
prostacyclin is introduced into the main pulmonary artery and allowed 
to  circulate  through  the  lungs.  This  vasoreactive  prostanoid  helps  to 
ensure  adequate  pulmonary  flush  by  dilating  the  pulmonary  vascu-
lature. The heart is arrested first, then the pulmonoplegia solution is 
instilled into the lungs at a low controlled pressure. Topical iced-saline 
solution is instilled into both pleural spaces. After the heart has been 
explanted, the individual pulmonic veins are flushed retrogradely. The 
lungs are then re-expanded, the trachea is clamped, and the explanted 
allograft is stored in ice-cold saline solution for transport. If the right 
and left lungs are being procured for different recipients, the posterior 
left atrium, the main pulmonary artery, and the left main-stem bron-
chus are divided to separate the right and left lungs, and the organs are 
stored and shipped separately.

 ■ RECIPIENT OPERATION AND EARLY 
POSTTRANSPLANT CONSIDERATIONS
Recipient Operation  The recipient operation can be divided into 
two parts. The first part involves the explant of the native lung and the 
second part involves the implant of the new lung. There are generally 
three main surgical approaches to the completion of the operation: a 
right or left thoracotomy, a transverse thoracosternotomy (clamshell), 
or  median  sternotomy.  These  approaches  are  all  favored  by  various 
centers  for  different  benefits.  The  thoracotomy  approach  allows  for 
explant and implant of donor lungs without the use of cardiopulmo-
nary bypass (CPB) and is often the preferred approach for single-lung 
transplant.  The  clamshell  incision  offers  the  advantages  of  increased 
exposure  compared  to  either  thoracotomy  or  median  sternotomy 
but  comes  at  the  cost  of  greater  morbidity  and  postoperative  wound 
complications.  This  incision  can  be  used  to  perform  bilateral  lung 
transplants and allows for the possibility of avoiding CPB. A median 
sternotomy approach can be used to perform bilateral lung transplant. 
This  approach  offers  the  advantage  of  fewer  wound  complications, 
less postoperative pain, and flexibility with more complex or concom-
itant cardiac procedures at the time of lung transplant. This approach 
mandates  the  use  of  CPB.  The  routine  use  of  CPB  allows  for  early 
pneumonectomies without hemodynamic compromise and can signifi-
cantly reduce the ischemic time to the second allograft. Additionally, 
overcirculation to the first allograft can be minimized with the routine 
use of CPB. Others prefer to avoid CPB as avoidance may be associated

with decreased need for blood product administration and lower inci-
dence of primary graft dysfunction.

Anesthetic  monitoring  for  lung  transplant  should  include  arterial 
pressure monitoring, pulse oximetry, continuous electrocardiographic 
monitoring,  temperature  monitoring,  and  urine  output  monitoring. 
Large-bore  IV  access  and  central  venous  access  are  vital  to  manage 
the  patient  safely.  On  a  selective  basis,  pulmonary  artery  pressure 
monitoring  and  transesophageal  echocardiographic  monitoring  may 
be useful. For patients without the planned use of CPB, double-lumen 
endotracheal  tubes  are  mandatory,  whereas  they  can  be  avoided  for 
patients transplanted on CPB.

Once access to the thorax has been completed, the hilar structures 
are isolated and divided. The bronchial anastomosis is completed first, 
and  the  anastomosis  is  checked  to  ensure  that  it  is  secure  by  insuf-
flating  the  lung  gently  while  keeping  the  anastomosis  under  saline 
solution  to  observe  for  bubbles.  The  donor  left  atrial  cuff  incorpo-
rating the pulmonary vein is connected to the native left atrium and 
the  donor  right  or  left  pulmonary  artery  is  connected  to  the  native 
pulmonary artery. After completion of the vascular anastomoses, the 
lungs are gently reperfused. During this early reperfusion period, lung- 
protective  ventilation  strategies  are  employed  and  oxygen  tension  is 
reduced. The patient is transitioned to normal ventilation, drains are 
placed in the thoracic cavity, and the wounds are closed.

Induction  of  Immunosuppression 
Initiation  of  immunosup-
pression starts with induction of the patient under general anesthesia. 
Many  programs  utilize  an  induction  agent  (most  commonly  an  IL-2 
receptor/CD25  antagonist,  but  antithymocyte  globulin,  anti-CD52 
monoclonal antibodies, or other induction agents may also be used), 
and systemic corticosteroids and purine modulators are administered 
after  induction  is  complete.  If  an  IL2  receptor  antagonist  is  utilized 
for induction, a second dose is administered 4 days after the original 
dose. An additional dose of methylprednisolone is administered after 
allograft reperfusion in the operating room. Three-drug immune sup-
pression is initiated with a calcineurin inhibitor, purine modulator, and 
continued systemic corticosteroids. In patients with severe acute renal 
dysfunction, calcineurin inhibitor initiation may be delayed.

Perioperative Considerations and Complications  Early mor-
bidity and mortality after lung transplant most commonly are sequelae 
of  primary  graft  dysfunction  or  infection.  Very  rarely,  hyperacute 
rejection  has  been  observed;  however,  with  the  implementation  of 
robust systems to ensure ABO and HLA compatibility at the time of 
transplant, the occurrence of hyperacute rejection is extremely uncom-
mon. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) encompasses a constellation of 
findings that result in poor early graft function after transplant. This 
phenomenon is often the consequence of ischemia-reperfusion injury 
in the allograft and is not related to infection or rejection. It is char-
acterized by a diffuse pattern of infiltrates on the chest x-ray and poor 
pulmonary gas exchange with PaO2:FiO2 ratios <300, with severe PGD 
characterized by diffuse severe infiltrates and a P:F ratio of <100 at 72 h 
posttransplant. Most cases of PGD are mild and self-limiting, resolving 
with  supportive  care.  However,  if  the  PGD  is  severe  and  worsening 
despite maximal medical therapy, diuresis, inotropic therapy, maximal 
ventilation support, and paralysis of the patient, mechanical circulatory 
support  with  ECMO  can  become  necessary.  The  incidence  of  severe 
PGD  has  been  steady  over  the  past  two  decades  at  approximately 
10–15% in most programs.

Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections are leading causes of morbid-
ity  and  mortality  in  lung  transplantation.  The  lung  is  one  of  the  few 
solid organs that is in continuous contact with the environment. Each 
breath has the potential to introduce new organisms, and the reduced 
lymphatic  function  and  mucociliary  clearance  in  the  transplanted 
lung  increase  the  risk  of  serious  infection.  The  highest  incidence  of 
infection  is  early  after  lung  transplant  and  coincides  with  the  inten-
sity  of  immune  suppression.  Early  infections,  occurring  within  the 
first  month  after  transplantation,  are  commonly  bacterial  (especially 
gram-negative  bacilli)  and  manifest  as  pneumonia,  mediastinitis, 
urinary  tract  infections,  catheter  sepsis,  and  skin  infections.  Patients 

can  develop  pathogenic  infections  with  organisms  associated  with 
pretransplant  colonization,  and  perioperative  antibiotic  regimens  are 
often deployed to address this. Viral infections, and CMV infections, 
in  particular,  can  lead  to  severe  recipient  disease  and  early  loss  of 
graft  and  life.  The  majority  of  transplant  programs  employ  antiviral 
prophylaxis in the early transplant period to avoid such complications. 
Invasive  fungal  infections  peak  in  frequency  between  10  days  and 
2  months  after  transplantation.  Fungal  prophylaxis  regimens  in  the 
early posttransplant period vary widely. Treatment consists of inhaled 
amphotericin B in the setting of airway infection and/or azole therapy 
with more advanced or invasive disease. The institution of prophylaxis 
with  oral  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (or  inhalational  pentami-
dine for sulfa-allergic patients) has effectively prevented Pneumocystis 
pneumonia.  The  risk  of  Pneumocystis  infection  is  highest  during  the 
first  year  after  transplant.  However,  as  infections  can  also  occur  late 
after  transplant,  most  centers  recommend  prophylactic  therapy  be 
continued for life.

 ■ LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT OF LUNG 
TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS
While survival after lung transplantation continues to improve by era, 
the  survival  rates  in  this  group  are  lower  than  in  other  solid-organ 
cohorts. Approximately 50% of lung transplant recipients will experi-
ence at least one episode of acute rejection in the first posttransplant 
year,  and  by  5  years  posttransplant,  approximately  half  will  have 
developed chronic rejection. As a result, posttransplant immune sup-
pression regimens may be more aggressive than in other solid-organ 
recipients, as described above. The immunosuppressive regimen must 
be balanced against the potential toxicities that accrue with these med-
ications over time.

Acute cellular rejection in lung transplant recipients is most com-
mon in the first posttransplant year, with a decreased but not absent 
frequency thereafter. Infections can stimulate cellular rejection, most 
clearly demonstrated in the setting of CMV infection, but also noted 
after other infections. Most programs incorporate a schedule of routine 
surveillance  bronchoscopy  to  assess  for  acute  cellular  rejection  post-
transplant. Acute cellular rejection manifests as a lymphocytic infiltrate 
involving the distal small vessels and capillaries and/or a lymphocytic 
bronchiolitis  involving  the  distal  airways  of  the  lung.  Acute  cellular 
rejection,  a  risk  factor  for  the  development  of  chronic  lung  allograft 
dysfunction  (CLAD),  is  treated  with  augmented  immune  suppres-
sion. Antibody-mediated rejection in its classic form is a neutrophilic 
vasculitis associated with the small vessels and capillaries of the lung, 
with associated deposition of by-products of the complement cascade, 
in  the  setting  of  allograft  dysfunction  and  circulating  donor-specific 
HLA antibodies in the blood. The manifestations of antibody-mediated 
rejection  in  the  lung  allograft  are  less  specific  than  in  other  organs. 
Further research is ongoing into the diagnostic and treatment consid-
erations of this entity in lung transplantation.

CLAD is an overarching description of the syndrome of long-term 
allograft  rejection.  The  classic  manifestation  of  CLAD  is  obliterative 
bronchiolitis, the development of fibrinous material within the distal 
airways  that  leads  to  small-airways  obstruction.  As  transbronchial 
biopsies are insensitive for diagnosing obliterative bronchiolitis, a clin-
ical  diagnostic  designation  of  bronchiolitis  obliterans  syndrome  can 
be made when specific PFT criteria are met and other causes of PFT 
decline are excluded. CLAD can also present as a restrictive phenotype, 
with  imaging  demonstrating  upper  lobe–predominant  pleural  thick-
ening, small lung volumes, and interstitial changes on high-resolution 
CT. Numerous therapies for CLAD have been utilized, including azith-
romycin,  montelukast,  extracorporeal  photopheresis,  alemtuzumab, 
and others, with varying degrees of success.

Infection is a significant complication of lung transplantation, with 
persistent  risk  over  the  lifetime  of  the  transplant  recipient.  As  time 
progresses, the chance of opportunistic infection increases. The risk of 
bacterial infection and fungal infection remains, and can affect the lung 
parenchyma,  airways  and  anastomotic  sites,  and  other  organs.  Viral 
infections  such  as  CMV  reactivation  and  infection,  EBV-associated

299 Interventional Pulmonary 

Medicine
Lonny Yarmus, David Feller-Kopman

Interventional pulmonary medicine is a subspecialty of pulmonary and 
critical care medicine focusing on the evaluation and management of 
patients with thoracic malignancy, central airway obstruction, pleural 
disease, and advanced obstructive lung disease such as chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema and asthma. Novel min-
imally invasive interventions have drastically changed the way we care 
for  patients.  In  this  chapter,  we  will  summarize  recent  developments 
and evolving technologies in interventional pulmonology (IP).

DIAGNOSTIC BRONCHOSCOPY
With the introduction of the rigid bronchoscope by Gustav Killian in 
1897,  the  mortality  associated  with  foreign-body  aspiration  dropped 
from over 90% to less than 5%, as patients no longer had to suffer from 
airway  obstruction  and  postobstructive  pneumonia.  Shigeto  Ikeda 
developed  the  flexible  bronchoscope  in  1967,  allowing  access  to  the 
peripheral airways and lung parenchyma. Bronchoscopy has remained 
an important diagnostic and therapeutic procedure, and recent tech-
nology has significantly increased its utility.

 ■ ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND
The  diagnosis  and  staging  of  lung  cancer  remains  one  of  the  most 
important  roles  of  advanced  diagnostic  bronchoscopy  and  IP.  Con-
vex  endobronchial  ultrasound  (cEBUS)  is  a  flexible  bronchoscope 
combined  with  ultrasound  technology  that  allows  for  real-time 
visualization  during  transbronchial  needle  aspiration  (TBNA)  of 
mediastinal  and  hilar  lymph  nodes  and  masses  adjacent  to  the  air-
ways (Fig. 299-1).

With  a  sensitivity  of  90%  and  a  specificity  of  100%,  cEBUS  has 
become the gold standard for lung cancer staging and can provide suf-
ficient tissue to perform molecular profiling to guide targeted therapies 
in lung cancer with adequacy rates for testing that exceed 95%. cEBUS 
is also extremely helpful in diagnosing mediastinal and hilar adenopa-
thy due to sarcoidosis and lymphoma.

 ■ PERIPHERAL BRONCHOSCOPY
Evaluations of pulmonary nodules and lung masses are frequent indi-
cations  for  bronchoscopy  as  a  way  to  achieve  a  minimally  invasive 
diagnosis. Historically, the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy to target 
peripheral pulmonary lesions was approximately <60%. To improve on 
targeting  success,  multiple  guidance  platforms  allow  for  more  distal 
improved access in the periphery of the lung.

Smaller  bronchoscopes  that  are  <4  mm  in  diameter  can  be  com-
bined  with  available  imaging  tools  to  improve  target  localization. 
Radial-probe  endobronchial  ultrasound  utilizes  a  radial  scanning 
ultrasound probe that is inserted through the bronchoscope and into 
the lung, producing a real-time image of the target lesion. Electromag-
netic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) involves image-guidance systems 
that  manipulate  thin-slice  CT  images  to  create  virtual  airway  recon-
structions used as guided maps during bronchoscopy. Robotic-assisted 
bronchoscopic platforms offer the enhanced articulation and stability 
of a robotic arm replacing the traditional flexible bronchoscope. Addi-
tional studies are currently underway to explore further the utility of 
these systems for peripheral lesion biopsy.

THERAPEUTIC BRONCHOSCOPY
Therapeutic bronchoscopy is indicated for the relief of malignant and 
nonmalignant  central  airway  obstruction,  asthma,  and  emphysema. 
Active research is also focusing on the utility of bronchoscopy for the 
ablation of early-stage lung cancer, as well as the treatment of chronic 
bronchitis.

 ■ CENTRAL AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION
Central  airway  obstruction  (CAO)  describes  obstruction  of  the  tra-
chea, main stem bronchi, bronchus intermedius, and/or lobar bronchi, 
and can present as intrinsic (endoluminal), extrinsic (extraluminal), or 
mixed (extraluminal tumor resulting in mass effect and endoluminal 
involvement) (Fig. 299-2). The differential diagnosis of CAO is shown 
in Table 299-1.

Patients often initially present with cough and exertional dyspnea, 
but then progress with increasing severity of obstruction to dyspnea at 
rest, stridor, and respiratory failure. Patients may also have wheezing, 
hemoptysis, or symptoms of postobstructive infection. Rigid bronchos-
copy is the preferred tool to manage CAO in conjunction with ablative 
therapies,  balloon  bronchoplasty,  and  airway  stenting  to  offer  rapid 
symptomatic relief with immediate reductions in the level of required 
care. Therapeutic bronchoscopy for CAO has been shown to improve 
significantly both quality of life and survival.

 ■ ABLATIVE THERAPIES FOR CAO
Ablative therapy in the airway consists of both heat (laser, electrocau-
tery, and argon plasma coagulation) and cold (cryotherapy) modalities. 
These  techniques  are  most  commonly  used  to  destroy  tumor  and 
provide hemostasis. The cryoprobe can also be used for foreign-body 
removal. Other modalities, such as brachytherapy (BRT) and photody-
namic therapy (PDT), have a delayed therapeutic effect and are often 
not suitable for situations where immediate relief of airway obstruction 
is desired.

 ■ BRONCHOPLASTY
Bronchoplasty (or bronchial dilation) can be achieved with the barrel 
of  the  rigid  bronchoscope  or  with  balloons  that  can  be  passed  via 
the rigid or flexible bronchoscope. Bronchoplasty is most commonly 
used  for  dilation  of  stenotic  airways  or  disruption  of  webs  related  to 
nonmalignant  causes  of  airway  diseases.  Although  dilation  generally 
leads to immediate relief of the stenosis, results can be short-lived and, 
hence, this technique is often combined with airway stenting. Compli-
cations are rare but can include airway tears if proper techniques are 
not followed.
 ■ AIRWAY STENTING
After airway patency is achieved, airway stents can be utilized to pre-
vent recurrence of CAO. Reports of endoscopically implantable stents 
for the airways date back to 1914. Airway stents are commonly used to 
treat patients with CAO due to extrinsic compression from a variety of 
malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Stents are effective and lead to 
symptomatic relief in >90% of patients. A variety of airway stents are 
available, each with its own benefits and detriments; it is important to 
choose the right stent for the specific indication. Stent complications 
are not uncommon and include mucostasis, infection, and the devel-
opment  of  granulation  tissue.  First-generation  biodegradable  stents, 
custom  3-dimensional-printed  stents,  and  drug-coated  stents  are 
currently  being  evaluated,  working  toward  a  personalized  medicine 
approach wherein stents are tailored to an individual’s airway anatomy 
and underlying disease.
 ■ ENDOBRONCHIAL INTRATUMORAL 
CHEMOTHERAPY
Endobronchial intratumoral chemotherapy (EITC) is an intervention 
aimed  at  improving  and/or  maintaining  airway  patency  in  patients 
with malignant CAO, with the potential to eliminate the need for air-
way  stenting  and  its  associated  complications.  Under  bronchoscopic 
guidance,  high-dose  therapeutics  can  be  injected  directly  into  tumor 
to  enhance  response  and  limit  systemic  side  effects.  Most  recently,  a 
novel microneedle injection catheter has been used to optimize drug 
delivery of paclitaxel, and was shown to be both feasible and safe with 
no  restenosis.  Additional  studies  are  needed  to  assess  the  long-term 
effects of EITC.
 ■ ABLATIVE THERAPIES FOR EARLY-STAGE  
LUNG CANCER
Bronchoscopic  ablation  of  early-stage  lung  cancer  has  long  been 
described as the “holy grail” of bronchoscopy due to the appeal of stag-
ing, diagnosing, and treating biopsy-proven early-stage lung cancer in 
one procedural setting. There is limited experience with bronchoscopic 
radiofrequency ablation (B-RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) as a 
potential means to treat early-stage lung cancer. Ultimately, the efficacy 
of bronchoscopic ablation of early-stage nonoperable lung cancer must 
be  proven  in  longitudinal  studies  demonstrating  noninferiority  in 
survival as compared to the current gold standard of stereotactic body 
radiation (SBRT).
 ■ BRONCHOSCOPIC THERAPIES FOR ASTHMA
Bronchial  thermoplasty  (BT)  is  a  treatment  for  patients  with  severe 
persistent asthma who remain symptomatic despite maximal medical 
treatment that delivers radiofrequency energy to the airways to reduce 
their smooth muscle mass. A pivotal randomized clinical trial did not 
show  a  change  in  FEV1  or  airway  hyperresponsiveness,  but  was  able 
to  demonstrate  an  improvement  in  quality  of  life  and  reduction  in 
exacerbation rates, visits to the emergency department, and days lost 
from  school  or  work.  At  this  time,  the  ideal  asthma  phenotypes  and 
ideal candidates for this treatment modality remain to be determined.

 ■ BRONCHOSCOPIC THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC 
OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
The National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), published in 2003, 
demonstrated  that  lung  volume  reduction  (LVR)  surgery  for  severe 
emphysema confers improved survival and exercise capacity in patients 
with  upper  lobe–predominant  disease  and  poor  exercise  capacity.  At 

the same time, it showed high perioperative morbidity and mortality. 
During the last decade, several bronchoscopic therapeutic modalities 
have  been  tested,  including  valves,  coils,  steam,  stents,  and  foam,  in 
patients  with  severe  emphysema  to  mimic  the  physiologic  effects  of 
surgical lung volume reduction (SLVR) in a less invasive fashion.

 ■ BRONCHOSCOPIC LUNG VOLUME REDUCTION
Bronchoscopic  lung  volume  reduction  (BLVR)  via  valve  placement 
involves placement of one-way valves in airways leading to areas of the 
lung with significant emphysema, allowing air and mucus to exit but 
blocking  air  entry  to  achieve  lobar  collapse.  Several  clinical  trials  on 
BLVR with valves have demonstrated improvements in lung function 
and overall improvement in quality of life and exercise tolerance. The 
overall  safety  profile  of  these  valve  systems  compares  favorably  with 
surgical  LVR  with  a  much  lower  rate  of  perioperative  morbidity  and 
mortality.

 ■ TARGETED LUNG DENERVATION
Targeted  lung  denervation  is  a  novel  therapy  that  involves  broncho-
scopic  ablation  of  peribronchial  parasympathetic  nerves  in  order 
to  achieve  permanent  bronchodilation.  Unlike  bronchoscopic  LVR, 
which  focuses  exclusively  on  patients  with  emphysema,  targeted 
lung denervation is potentially applicable more broadly to all COPD 
patients, with studies showing a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations 
when compared with a sham denervated group.

 ■ PLEURAL INTERVENTIONS
Thoracic  ultrasound  has  become  invaluable  in  the  evaluation  of 
patients  with  pleural  effusion  and  pneumothorax.  Medical  thoracos-
copy (also called pleuroscopy) is a minimally invasive technique most 
commonly used to evaluate recurrent exudative pleural effusions, and 
is associated with a diagnostic yield of >95%.

Indwelling  pleural  catheters  (IPCs)  have  gained  tremendous  pop-
ularity and have been declared by evidence-based guidelines to be as 
acceptable as chemical pleurodesis for the management of symptom-
atic malignant pleural effusions. When comparing IPC and pleurodesis 
via talc slurry, two multicentered, open-label, randomized controlled 
trials  demonstrated  IPC  effectively  relieved  dyspnea,  decreased  the 
duration of hospital stay, and lessened the need for future procedures.
Pleural  infection  (empyema  or  complex  parapneumonic  effusion) 
is commonly encountered in clinical practice. The mainstay of therapy 
typically consisted of antibiotics, drainage of the infected pleural space 
with tube thoracostomy, and possible need for surgical decortication. 
The landmark Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial (MIST2) demon-
strated that intrapleural sequential administration of rTPA and DNase 
resulted  in  significant  radiographic  and  clinical  improvements  and 
allowed >90% of patients to avoid surgery.

 ■ PNEUMOTHORAX AND PERSISTENT AIR LEAK
Persistent  air  leak  is  defined  as  a  nonresolving  pneumothorax  with 
an  air  leak  lasting  more  than  5–7  days.  For  over  a  decade,  the  U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration has maintained a humanitarian device 
exemption  for  compassionate  use  of  the  Spiration  Valve  System  for 
management  of  persistent  air  leak  following  lobectomy,  segmentec-
tomy, or LVR surgery, although the device has also been used “off label” 
for the treatment of persistent air leak due to primary and secondary 
spontaneous pneumothoraces.

SUMMARY
IP provides diagnostic and therapeutic options that span the spectrum 
of  benign  and  malignant  airway  and  pleural  disorders.  The  constant 
innovations in diagnostic and treatment modalities have continued to 
help push the boundaries of pulmonary medicine.
