PART 2

Most Aδ and C fiber afferents respond maximally to intense (painful) 
stimuli  and  produce  the  subjective  experience  of  pain  when  they  
are  activated;  this  defines  them  as  primary  afferent  nociceptors  (pain 
receptors). The ability to detect painful stimuli is completely abolished 
when conduction in Aδ and C fiber axons is blocked.

Individual primary afferent nociceptors can respond to several dif-
ferent types of noxious stimuli. For example, most nociceptors respond 
to  heat;  intense  cold;  intense  mechanical  distortion,  such  as  a  pinch; 
changes in pH, particularly an acidic environment; and application of 
chemical irritants including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), serotonin, 
bradykinin (BK), and histamine. The transient receptor potential cat-
ion channel subfamily V member 1 (TrpV1), also known as the vanil-
loid receptor, mediates perception of some noxious stimuli, especially 
heat sensations, by nociceptive neurons; it is activated by heat, acidic 
pH,  endogenous  mediators,  and  capsaicin,  a  component  of  hot  chili 
peppers.

Sensitization  When  intense,  repeated,  or  prolonged  stimuli  are 
applied  to  damaged  or  inflamed  tissues,  the  threshold  for  activating 
primary  afferent  nociceptors  is  lowered,  and  the  frequency  of  firing 
is higher for all stimulus intensities. Inflammatory mediators such as 
BK, nerve-growth factor, some prostaglandins (PGs), and leukotrienes 
contribute  to  this  process,  which  is  called  sensitization.  Sensitization 
occurs at the level of the peripheral nerve terminal (peripheral sensi-
tization)  as  well  as  at  the  level  of  the  dorsal  horn  of  the  spinal  cord 
(central  sensitization).  Peripheral  sensitization  occurs  in  damaged  or 
inflamed  tissues,  when  inflammatory  mediators  activate  intracellu-
lar  signal  transduction  in  nociceptors,  prompting  an  increase  in  the 
production,  transport,  and  membrane  insertion  of  chemically  gated 
and voltage-gated ion channels. These changes increase the excitabil-
ity  of  nociceptor  terminals  and  lower  their  threshold  for  activation 
by  mechanical,  thermal,  and  chemical  stimuli.  Central  sensitization 
occurs when activity, generated by nociceptors during inflammation, 
enhances the excitability of nerve cells in the dorsal horn of the spinal 
cord. Following injury and resultant sensitization, normally innocuous 
stimuli  can  produce  pain  (termed  allodynia).  Sensitization  is  a  clini-
cally  important  process  that  contributes  to  tenderness,  soreness,  and 
hyperalgesia (increased pain intensity in response to the same noxious 
stimulus; e.g., pinprick causes severe pain). A striking example of sen-
sitization is sunburned skin, in which severe pain can be produced by 
a gentle slap or a warm shower.

Sensitization  is  of  particular  importance  for  pain  and  tenderness 
in deep tissues. Viscera are normally relatively insensitive to noxious 
mechanical and thermal stimuli, although hollow viscera do generate

13 Pain: Pathophysiology 
and Management
James P. Rathmell, Howard L. Fields

The  province  of  medicine  is  to  preserve  and  restore  health  and  to 
relieve suffering. Understanding pain is essential to both of these goals. 
Because pain is universally understood as a signal of disease, it is the 
most common symptom that brings a patient to a physician’s attention. 
The  function  of  the  pain  sensory  system  is  to  protect  the  body  and 
maintain homeostasis. It does this by detecting, localizing, and identi-
fying potential or actual tissue-damaging processes. Because different 
diseases produce characteristic patterns of tissue damage, the quality, 
time course, and location of a patient’s pain lend important diagnostic 
clues. It is the physician’s responsibility to assess each patient promptly 
for any remediable cause underlying the pain and to provide rapid and 
effective pain relief whenever possible.

THE PAIN SENSORY SYSTEM
Pain  is  an  unpleasant  sensation  localized  to  a  part  of  the  body.  It  is 
often  described  in  terms  of  a  penetrating  or  tissue-destructive  pro-
cess (e.g., stabbing, burning, twisting, tearing, squeezing) and/or of a 
bodily  or  emotional  reaction  (e.g.,  terrifying,  nauseating,  sickening). 
Furthermore, any pain of moderate or higher intensity is accompanied 
by anxiety and the urge to escape or terminate the feeling. These prop-
erties  illustrate  the  duality  of  pain:  it  is  both  sensation  and  emotion. 
When it is acute, pain is characteristically associated with behavioral 
arousal  and  a  stress  response  consisting  of  increased  blood  pressure, 
heart rate, pupil diameter, and plasma cortisol levels. In addition, local 
muscle contraction (e.g., limb flexion, abdominal wall rigidity) is often 
present.
 ■ PERIPHERAL MECHANISMS
The Primary Afferent Nociceptor  A peripheral nerve consists 
of  the  axons  of  three  different  types  of  neurons:  primary  sensory 
afferents,  motor  neurons,  and  sympathetic  postganglionic  neurons  
(Fig.  13-1).  The  cell  bodies  of  primary  sensory  afferents  are  located 
in  the  dorsal  root  ganglia  within  the 
vertebral foramina. The primary afferent 
axon has two branches: one projects cen-
trally into the spinal cord and the other 
projects peripherally to innervate tissues. 
Primary  afferents  are  classified  by  their 
diameter,  degree  of  myelination,  and 
conduction  velocity.  The  largest  diame-
ter afferent fibers, A-beta (Aβ), respond 
maximally to light touch and/or moving 
stimuli;  they  are  present  primarily  in 
nerves that innervate the skin. In normal 
individuals,  the  activity  of  these  fibers 
does  not  produce  pain.  There  are  two 
other  classes  of  primary  afferent  nerve 
fibers:  the  small  diameter  myelinated 
A-delta  (Aδ)  and  the  unmyelinated  (C) 
axons (Fig. 13-1). These fibers are pres-
ent  in  nerves  to  the  skin  and  to  deep 
somatic  and  visceral  structures.  Some 
tissues,  such  as  the  cornea,  are  inner-
vated  only  by  Aδ  and  C  fiber  afferents.

afferents  with  cell  bodies  in  the  dorsal  root  ganglion  and  sympathetic  postganglionic  fibers  with  cell  bodies  in  the 
sympathetic ganglion. Primary afferents include those with large-diameter myelinated (Aβ), small-diameter myelinated 
(Aδ), and unmyelinated (C) axons. All sympathetic postganglionic fibers are unmyelinated.

significant discomfort when distended. In contrast, when affected by 
a  disease  process  with  an  inflammatory  component,  deep  structures 
such  as  joints  or  hollow  viscera  characteristically  become  exquisitely 
sensitive to mechanical stimulation.

A large proportion of Aδ and C fiber afferents innervating viscera 
are completely insensitive in normal noninjured, noninflamed tissue. 
That  is,  they  cannot  be  activated  by  known  mechanical  or  thermal 
stimuli and are not spontaneously active. However, in the presence of 
inflammatory mediators, these afferents become sensitive to mechan-
ical  stimuli.  Such  afferents  have  been  termed  silent  nociceptors,  and 
their  characteristic  properties  may  explain  how,  under  pathologic 
conditions,  the  relatively  insensitive  deep  structures  can  become  the 
source of severe and debilitating pain and tenderness. Low pH, PGs, 
leukotrienes,  and  other  inflammatory  mediators  such  as  BK  play  a 
significant role in sensitization.

Nociceptor-Induced  Inflammation  Primary  afferent  nocicep-
tors are not simply passive messengers of threats to tissue injury but also 
play  an  active  role  in  tissue  protection  through  a  neuroeffector  func-
tion.  Most  nociceptors  contain  polypeptide  mediators,  including  sub-
stance P, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), and cholecystokinin,  
that  are  released  from  their  peripheral  terminals  when  they  are  acti-
vated  (Fig.  13-2).  Substance  P  is  an  11-amino-acid  peptide  that  is 
released  in  peripheral  tissues  from  primary  afferent  nociceptors  and 
has multiple biologic activities. It is a potent vasodilator, causes mast 
cell degranulation, is a chemoattractant for leukocytes, and increases 
the  production  and  release  of  inflammatory  mediators.  Interestingly, 
depletion  of  substance  P  from  joints  reduces  the  severity  of  experi-
mental arthritis.

 ■ CENTRAL MECHANISMS
The  Spinal  Cord  and  Referred  Pain  The  axons  of  primary 
afferent  nociceptors  enter  the  spinal  cord  via  the  dorsal  root.  They 
terminate  in  the  dorsal  horn  of  the  spinal  gray  matter  (Fig.  13-3). 
The  terminals  of  primary  afferent  axons  contact  spinal  neurons  that 
transmit  the  pain  signal  to  brain  sites  involved  in  pain  perception. 
When primary afferents are activated by noxious stimuli, they release 
neurotransmitters from their terminals that excite the spinal cord neu-
rons. The major neurotransmitter released is glutamate, which rapidly 
excites the second-order dorsal horn neurons. Primary afferent noci-
ceptor terminals also release substance P and CGRP, which produce a 
slower  and  longer-lasting  excitation  of  the  dorsal  horn  neurons.  The 
axon of each primary afferent contacts many spinal neurons, and each 
spinal neuron receives convergent inputs from many primary afferents.
The convergence of sensory inputs to a single spinal pain-transmission 
neuron is of great importance because it underlies the phenomenon of 
referred  pain.  All  spinal  neurons  that  receive  input  from  the  viscera 
and deep musculoskeletal structures also receive input from the skin. 
The convergence patterns are determined by the spinal segment of the 
dorsal root ganglion that supplies the afferent innervation of a struc-
ture. For example, the afferents that supply the central diaphragm are 
derived from the third and fourth cervical dorsal root ganglia. Primary 
afferents with cell bodies in these same ganglia supply the skin of the 
shoulder and lower neck. Thus, sensory inputs from both the shoulder 
skin  and  the  central  diaphragm  converge  on  pain-transmission  neu-
rons in the third and fourth cervical spinal segments. Because of this 
convergence and the fact that the spinal neurons are most often activated 
by inputs from the skin, activity evoked in spinal neurons by input from 
deep structures is often mislocalized by the patient to a bodily location 
that roughly corresponds with the region of skin innervated by the same 
spinal  segment.  Thus,  inflammation  near  the  central  diaphragm  is 
often  reported  as  shoulder  discomfort.  This  spatial  displacement  of 
pain sensation from the site of the injury that produces it is known as 
referred pain.

Ascending  Pathways  for  Pain  A  majority  of  spinal  neurons 
contacted by primary afferent nociceptors send their axons to the con-
tralateral thalamus. These axons form the contralateral spinothalamic 
tract,  which  lies  in  the  anterolateral  white  matter  of  the  spinal  cord,

of primary afferent nociceptor terminals. A. Direct activation by intense pressure 
and  consequent  cell  damage.  Cell  damage  induces  lower  pH  (H+)  and  leads  to 
release of potassium (K+) and to synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) and bradykinin 
(BK). PGs increase the sensitivity of the terminal to BK and other pain-producing 
substances. B. Secondary activation. Impulses generated in the stimulated terminal 
propagate not only to the spinal cord but also into other terminal branches where 
they induce the release of peptides, including substance P (SP). Substance P causes 
vasodilation and neurogenic edema with further accumulation of BK. Substance P 
also causes the release of histamine (H) from mast cells and serotonin (5HT) from 
platelets.

the  lateral  edge  of  the  medulla,  and  the  lateral  pons  and  midbrain. 
The  spinothalamic  pathway  is  crucial  for  pain  sensation  in  humans. 
Interruption of this pathway produces permanent deficits in pain and 
temperature discrimination.

Spinothalamic tract axons ascend to several regions of the thalamus. 
There is tremendous divergence of the pain signal from these thalamic 
sites to several distinct areas of the cerebral cortex that subserve dif-
ferent aspects of the pain experience (Fig. 13-4). One of the thalamic 
projections  is  to  the  somatosensory  cortex.  This  projection  mediates 
the  sensory  discriminative  aspects  of  pain,  i.e.,  its  location,  intensity, 
and  quality.  Other  thalamic  neurons  project  to  cortical  regions  that 
are  linked  to  emotional  responses,  such  as  the  cingulate  and  insular 
cortex. These pathways to the frontal cortex subserve the affective or 
unpleasant emotional dimension of pain. This affective dimension of 
pain produces suffering and exerts potent control of behavior. Because 
of this dimension, fear is a constant companion of pain. As a conse-
quence, injury or surgical lesions to areas of the frontal cortex activated 
by  painful  stimuli  can  diminish  the  emotional  impact  of  pain  while

largely preserving the individual’s ability to recognize noxious stimuli 
as painful.
 ■ PAIN MODULATION
The pain produced by injuries of similar magnitude is remarkably vari-
able  in  different  situations  and  in  different  individuals.  For  example, 
athletes have been known to sustain serious fractures with only minor 
pain,  and  Beecher’s  classic  World  War  II  survey  revealed  that  many  
soldiers in battle were unbothered by injuries that would have produced 
agonizing pain in civilian patients. Furthermore, even the suggestion

FIGURE 13-4  Pain-transmission and modulatory pathways. A. Transmission system 
for nociceptive messages. Noxious stimuli activate the sensitive peripheral ending 
of the primary afferent nociceptor by the process of transduction. The message is 
then  transmitted  over  the  peripheral  nerve  to  the  spinal  cord,  where  it  synapses 
with cells of origin of the major ascending pain pathway, the spinothalamic tract. 
The message is relayed in the thalamus to the anterior cingulate (C), frontal insular 
(F), and somatosensory cortex (SS). B. Pain-modulation network. Inputs from frontal

that a treatment will relieve pain can have a significant analgesic effect 
(the placebo effect). On the other hand, many patients find even minor 
injuries  such  as  venipuncture  frightening  and  unbearable,  and  the 
expectation of pain can induce pain even without a noxious stimulus. 
The  suggestion  that  pain  will  worsen  following  administration  of  an 
inert substance can increase its perceived intensity (the nocebo effect).
The  powerful  effect  of  expectation  and  other  psychological  vari-
ables on the perceived intensity of pain is explained by brain circuits 
that modulate the activity of the pain-transmission pathways. One of 
these circuits has links to the hypothalamus, midbrain, and medulla, 
and it selectively controls spinal pain-transmission neurons through a 
descending pathway (Fig. 13-4).

Human  brain-imaging  studies  have  implicated  this  pain-modulating 
circuit in the pain-relieving effect of attention, suggestion, and opioid 
analgesic  medications  (Fig.  13-5).  Furthermore,  each  of  the  com-
ponent  structures  of  the  pathway  contains  opioid  receptors  and  is 
sensitive to the direct application of opioid drugs. In animals, lesions 
of  this  descending  modulatory  system  reduce  the  analgesic  effect  of

systemically  administered  opioids  such  as  morphine.  Along  with  the 
opioid receptor, the component nuclei of this pain-modulating circuit 
contain  endogenous  opioid  peptides  such  as  the  enkephalins  and 
β-endorphin.

The most reliable way to activate this endogenous opioid-mediated 
modulating system is by suggestion of pain relief or by intense emotion 
directed away from the pain-causing injury (e.g., during severe threat 
or an athletic competition). In fact, pain-relieving endogenous opioids 
are released following surgical procedures and in patients given a pla-
cebo for pain relief.

Pain-modulating  circuits  can  enhance  as  well  as  suppress  pain. 
Both  pain-inhibiting  and  pain-facilitating  neurons  in  the  medulla 
project to and control spinal pain-transmission neurons. Because pain- 
transmission  neurons  can  be  activated  by  modulatory  neurons,  it  is 
theoretically possible to generate a pain signal with no peripheral nox-
ious stimulus. In fact, human functional imaging studies have demon-
strated increased activity in this circuit during migraine headaches. A 
central  circuit  that  facilitates  pain  could  account  for  the  finding  that 
pain  can  be  induced  by  suggestion  or  enhanced  by  expectation  and 
provides a framework for understanding how psychological factors can 
contribute to chronic pain.

 ■ NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Lesions  of  the  peripheral  or  central  nociceptive  pathways  typically 
result in a loss or impairment of pain sensation. Paradoxically, damage 
to or dysfunction of these pathways can also produce pain. For exam-
ple, damage to peripheral nerves, as occurs in diabetic neuropathy, or 
to  primary  afferents,  as  in  herpes  zoster  infection,  can  result  in  pain 
that is referred to the body region innervated by the damaged nerves. 
Pain may also be produced by damage to the central nervous system 
(CNS),  for  example,  in  some  patients  following  trauma  or  vascular 
injury  to  the  spinal  cord,  brainstem,  or  thalamic  areas  that  contain 
central nociceptive pathways. Such pains are termed neuropathic and 
are often severe and resistant to standard treatments for pain.

Neuropathic pain typically has an unusual burning, tingling, or elec-
tric shock-like quality and may occur spontaneously, without any stim-
ulus, or be triggered by very light touch. These features are rare in other 
types  of  pain.  On  examination,  a  sensory  deficit  is  characteristically 
co-extensive with the area of the patient’s pain. Hyperpathia, a greatly 
exaggerated  pain  response  to  innocuous  or  mild  nociceptive  stimuli, 
especially when applied repeatedly, is also characteristic of neuropathic 
pain;  patients  often  complain  that  the  very  lightest  moving  stimulus 
evokes exquisite pain (allodynia). In this regard, it is of clinical interest 
that a topical preparation of 5% lidocaine in patch form is effective for 
patients with postherpetic neuralgia who have prominent allodynia.

A  variety  of  mechanisms  contribute  to  neuropathic  pain.  As  with 
sensitized  primary  afferent  nociceptors,  damaged  primary  afferents, 
including  nociceptors,  become  highly  sensitive  to  mechanical  stim-
ulation  and  may  generate  impulses  in  the  absence  of  stimulation. 
Increased  sensitivity  and  spontaneous  activity  are  due,  in  part,  to  an 
increased  density  of  sodium  channels  in  the  damaged  nerve  fiber. 
Damaged  primary  afferents  may  also  develop  sensitivity  to  norepi-
nephrine. Interestingly, spinal cord pain-transmission neurons cut off 
from their normal input may also become spontaneously active. Thus, 
both central and peripheral nervous system hyperactivity contribute to 
neuropathic pain.

Sympathetically  Maintained  Pain  Patients  with  peripheral 
nerve injury occasionally develop spontaneous pain in or beyond the 
region innervated by the nerve. This pain is often described as having 
a burning quality. The pain typically begins after a delay of hours to 
days  or  even  weeks  and  is  accompanied  by  swelling  of  the  extrem-
ity,  periarticular  bone  loss,  and  arthritic  changes  in  the  distal  joints. 
Early  in  the  course  of  the  condition,  the  pain  may  be  relieved  by  a 
local  anesthetic  block  of  the  sympathetic  innervation  to  the  affected 
extremity.  Damaged  primary  afferent  nociceptors  acquire  adrenergic 
sensitivity and can be activated by stimulation of the sympathetic out-
flow. This constellation of spontaneous pain and signs of sympathetic 
dysfunction  following  injury  has  been  termed  complex  regional  pain 

syndrome (CRPS). When this occurs after an identifiable nerve injury, 
it is termed CRPS type II (also known as posttraumatic neuralgia or, 
if  severe,  causalgia).  When  a  similar  clinical  picture  appears  without 
obvious  nerve  injury,  it  is  termed  CRPS  type  I  (also  known  as  reflex 
sympathetic dystrophy). CRPS can be produced by a variety of injuries, 
including fractures of bone, soft tissue trauma, myocardial infarction, 
and stroke. CRPS type I typically resolves with symptomatic treatment; 
however, when it persists, detailed examination often reveals evidence 
of  peripheral  nerve  injury.  Although  the  pathophysiology  of  CRPS 
is  poorly  understood,  the  pain  and  the  signs  of  inflammation,  when 
acute,  can  be  rapidly  relieved  by  blocking  the  sympathetic  nervous 
system.  This  implies  that  sympathetic  activity  can  activate  undam-
aged nociceptors when inflammation is present. Signs of sympathetic 
hyperactivity should be sought in patients with posttraumatic pain and 
inflammation and no other obvious explanation.

TREATMENT
Acute Pain

The ideal treatment for any pain is to remove the cause; thus, while 
treatment  can  be  initiated  immediately,  efforts  to  establish  the 
underlying  etiology  should  always  proceed  as  treatment  begins. 
Sometimes, treating the underlying condition does not immediately 
relieve pain. Furthermore, some conditions are so painful that rapid 
and  effective  analgesia  is  essential  (e.g.,  the  postoperative  state, 
burns, trauma, cancer, or sickle cell crisis). Analgesic medications 
are  a  first  line  of  treatment  in  these  cases,  and  all  practitioners 
should be familiar with their use. 

ASPIRIN, ACETAMINOPHEN, AND NONSTEROIDAL  
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS (NSAIDS)
These  drugs  are  considered  together  because  they  are  used  for 
similar  problems  and  may  have  a  similar  mechanism  of  action 
(Table 13-1). All these compounds inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX), 
and except for acetaminophen, all have anti-inflammatory actions, 
especially at higher dosages. They are particularly effective for mild 
to moderate headache and for pain of musculoskeletal origin.

Because they are effective for these common types of pain and 
are  available  without  prescription,  COX  inhibitors  are  by  far  the 
most commonly used analgesics. They are absorbed well from the 
gastrointestinal  tract  and,  with  occasional  use,  have  only  mini-
mal side effects. With chronic use, gastric irritation is a common 
side  effect  of  aspirin  and  NSAIDs  and  is  the  problem  that  most 
frequently  limits  the  dose  that  can  be  given.  Gastric  irritation  is 
most severe with aspirin, which may cause erosion and ulceration 
of  the  gastric  mucosa  leading  to  bleeding  or  perforation.  Because 
aspirin  irreversibly  acetylates  platelet  COX  and  thereby  interferes 
with coagulation of the blood, gastrointestinal bleeding is a partic-
ular risk. Older age and history of gastrointestinal disease increase 
the  risks  of  aspirin  and  NSAIDs.  In  addition  to  the  well-known 
gastrointestinal toxicity of NSAIDs, nephrotoxicity is a significant 
problem for patients using these drugs on a chronic basis. Patients 
at  risk  for  renal  insufficiency,  particularly  those  with  significant 
contraction  of  their  intravascular  volume  as  occurs  with  chronic 
diuretic use or acute hypovolemia, should avoid NSAIDs. NSAIDs 
can  also  increase  blood  pressure  in  some  individuals.  Long-term 
treatment with NSAIDs requires regular blood pressure monitoring 
and treatment if necessary. Although toxic to the liver when taken 
in high doses, acetaminophen rarely produces gastric irritation and 
does not interfere with platelet function.

The introduction of parenteral forms of NSAIDs, ketorolac and 
diclofenac,  extends  the  usefulness  of  this  class  of  compounds  in 
the management of acute severe pain. Both agents are sufficiently 
potent and rapid in onset to supplant opioids as first-line treatment 
for many patients with acute severe headache and musculoskeletal 
pain.

There  are  two  major  classes  of  COX:  COX-1  is  constitutively 
expressed,  and  COX-2  is  induced  in  the  inflammatory  state.

COX-2-selective  drugs  have  similar  analgesic  potency  and  pro-
duce  less  gastric  irritation  than  the  nonselective  COX  inhibitors. 
The  use  of  COX-2-selective  drugs  does  not  appear  to  lower  the 
risk  of  nephrotoxicity  compared  to  nonselective  NSAIDs.  On  the 
other  hand,  COX-2-selective  drugs  offer  a  significant  benefit  in 
the  management  of  acute  postoperative  pain  because  they  do  not 
affect  blood  coagulation.  Nonselective  COX  inhibitors  (especially 

aspirin)  are  usually  contraindicated  postoperatively  because  they 
impair  platelet-mediated  blood  clotting  and  are  thus  associated 
with  increased  bleeding  at  the  operative  site.  COX-2  inhibitors, 
including  celecoxib  (Celebrex),  are  associated  with  increased  car-
diovascular risk, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarc-
tion,  stroke,  heart  failure,  or  a  thromboembolic  event.  It  appears 
that this is a class effect of NSAIDs, excluding aspirin. These drugs

are contraindicated in patients in the immediate period after cor-
onary  artery  bypass  surgery  and  should  be  used  with  caution  in 
elderly patients and those with a history of or significant risk factors 
for cardiovascular disease. 

OPIOID ANALGESICS
Opioids  are  the  most  potent  pain-relieving  drugs  currently  avail-
able.  Of  all  analgesics,  they  have  the  broadest  range  of  efficacy 
and  provide  the  most  reliable  and  effective  treatment  for  rapid 
pain relief. Although side effects are common, most are reversible: 
nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation, and constipation are the most 
frequent  and  bothersome  side  effects.  Respiratory  depression  is 
uncommon at standard analgesic doses but can be life-threatening. 
Opioid-related  side  effects  can  be  reversed  rapidly  with  the  nar-
cotic  antagonist  naloxone.  Many  physicians,  nurses,  and  patients 
have  a  certain  trepidation  about  using  opioids  that  is  based  on  a 
fear of initiating addiction in their patients. In fact, there is a very 
small chance of patients becoming addicted to narcotics as a result 
of  their  appropriate  medical  use.  For  chronic  pain,  particularly 
chronic  noncancer  pain,  the  risk  of  addiction  in  patients  taking 
opioids on a chronic basis remains small, but the risk does appear to 
increase with dose escalation. The physician should not hesitate to 
use opioid analgesics in patients with acute severe pain. Table 13-1 
lists the most commonly used opioid analgesics.

Opioids  produce  analgesia  by  actions  in  the  CNS.  They  acti-
vate pain-inhibitory neurons and directly inhibit pain-transmission 
neurons.  Most  of  the  commercially  available  opioid  analgesics 
act  at  the  same  opioid  receptor  (μ-receptor),  differing  mainly  in 
potency,  speed  of  onset,  duration  of  action,  and  optimal  route 
of  administration.  Some  side  effects  are  due  to  accumulation  of 
nonopioid  metabolites  that  are  unique  to  individual  drugs.  One 
striking example of this is normeperidine, a metabolite of meperi-
dine. At higher doses of meperidine, typically >1 g/d, accumulation 
of  normeperidine  can  produce  hyperexcitability  and  seizures  that 
are  not  reversible  with  naloxone.  Normeperidine  accumulation  is 
increased in patients with renal failure.

The  most  rapid  pain  relief  is  obtained  by  intravenous  admin-
istration of opioids; relief with oral administration is significantly 
slower. Because of the potential for respiratory depression, patients 
with any form of respiratory compromise must be kept under close 
observation following opioid administration; an oxygen-saturation 
monitor may be useful, but only in a setting where the monitor is 
under  constant  surveillance.  Opioid-induced  respiratory  depres-
sion  is  primarily  manifest  as  a  reduction  in  respiratory  rate  and 
is  typically  accompanied  by  sedation.  A  fall  in  oxygen  saturation 
represents  a  critical  level  of  respiratory  depression  and  the  need 
for immediate intervention to prevent life-threatening hypoxemia. 
Newer monitoring devices that incorporate capnography or phar-
yngeal air flow can detect apnea at the point of onset and should 
be  used  in  hospitalized  patients.  Ventilatory  assistance  should  be 
maintained  until  the  opioid-induced  respiratory  depression  has 
resolved.  The  opioid  antagonist  naloxone  should  be  readily  avail-
able  whenever  opioids  are  used  at  high  doses  or  in  patients  with 
compromised pulmonary function. Opioid effects are dose-related, 
and there is great variability among patients in the doses that relieve 
pain and produce side effects. Synergistic respiratory depression is 
common  when  opioids  are  administered  with  other  CNS  depres-
sants. Co-administration of benzodiazepines is particularly likely to 
produce respiratory depression and should be avoided, especially in 
outpatient pain management. Because of this variability in patient 
response, initiation of therapy requires titration to optimal dose and 
interval. The most important principle is to provide adequate pain 
relief. This requires determining whether the drug has adequately 
relieved the pain and timely reassessment to determine the optimal 
interval for dosing. The most common error made by physicians in 
managing severe pain with opioids is to prescribe an inadequate dose. 
Because many patients are reluctant to complain, this practice leads to 

needless suffering. In the absence of sedation at the expected time of 
peak effect, a physician should not hesitate to repeat the initial dose 
to achieve satisfactory pain relief.

A now standard approach to the problem of achieving adequate 
pain  relief  is  the  use  of  patient-controlled  analgesia  (PCA).  PCA 
uses  a  microprocessor-controlled  infusion  device  that  can  deliver 
a  baseline  continuous  dose  of  an  opioid  drug  as  well  as  prepro-
grammed  additional  doses  whenever  the  patient  pushes  a  button. 
The  patient  can  then  titrate  the  dose  to  the  optimal  level.  This 
approach is used most extensively for the management of postoper-
ative pain, but there is no reason why it should not be used for any 
hospitalized patient with persistent severe pain. PCA is also used for 
short-term home care of patients with intractable pain, such as that 
caused by metastatic cancer.

It is important to understand that the PCA device delivers small, 
repeated doses to maintain pain relief; in patients with severe pain, 
the  pain  must  first  be  brought  under control  with  a  loading  dose 
before transitioning to the PCA device. The bolus dose of the drug 
(typically 1 mg of morphine, 0.2 mg of hydromorphone, or 10 μg 
of fentanyl) can then be delivered repeatedly as needed. To prevent 
overdosing,  PCA  devices  are  programmed  with  a  lockout  period 
after each demand dose is delivered (typically starting at 10 min) 
and  a  limit  on  the  total  dose  delivered  per  hour.  Although  some 
have  advocated  the  use  of  a  simultaneous  continuous  or  basal 
infusion of the PCA drug, this may increase the risk of respiratory 
depression and has not been shown to increase the overall efficacy 
of the technique.

The availability of new routes of administration has extended the 
usefulness  of  opioid  analgesics.  Most  important  is  the  availability 
of spinal administration. Opioids can be infused through a spinal 
catheter placed either intrathecally or epidurally. By applying opi-
oids directly to the spinal or epidural space adjacent to the spinal 
cord, regional analgesia can be obtained using relatively low total 
doses.  Indeed,  the  dose  required  to  produce  effective  analgesia 
when using morphine intrathecally (0.1–0.3 mg) is a fraction of that 
required to produce similar analgesia when administered intrave-
nously (5–10 mg). In this way, side effects such as sedation, nausea, 
and  respiratory  depression  can  be  minimized.  This  approach  has 
been used extensively during labor and delivery and for postoper-
ative  pain  relief  following  surgical  procedures.  Continuous  intra-
thecal  delivery  via  implanted  spinal  drug-delivery  systems  is  now 
commonly  used,  particularly  for  the  treatment  of  cancer-related 
pain that would require sedating doses for adequate pain control if 
given systemically. Opioids can also be given intranasally (butorph-
anol), rectally, and transdermally (fentanyl and buprenorphine), or 
through  the  oral  mucosa  (fentanyl),  thus  avoiding  the  discomfort 
of frequent injections in patients who cannot be given oral medi-
cation. The fentanyl and buprenorphine transdermal patches have 
the advantage of providing fairly steady plasma levels, which may 
improve patient comfort.

Recent  additions  to  the  armamentarium  for  treating  opioid- 
induced side effects are the peripherally acting opioid antagonists 
alvimopan (Entereg) and methylnaltrexone (Rellistor). Alvimopan 
is available as an orally administered agent that is restricted to the 
intestinal lumen by limited absorption; methylnaltrexone is avail-
able  in  a  subcutaneously  administered  form  that  has  virtually  no 
penetration into the CNS. Both agents act by binding to peripheral 
μ-receptors,  thereby  inhibiting  or  reversing  the  effects  of  opioids 
at these peripheral sites. The action of both agents is restricted to 
receptor sites outside of the CNS; thus, these drugs can reverse the 
adverse effects of opioid analgesics that are mediated through their 
peripheral receptors without reversing their CNS-mediated analge-
sic effects. Alvimopan has proven effective in lowering the duration 
of persistent ileus following abdominal surgery in patients receiving 
opioid analgesics for postoperative pain control. Methylnaltrexone 
has  proven  effective  for  relief  of  opioid-induced  constipation  in 
patients taking opioid analgesics on a chronic basis.

Opioid and COX Inhibitor Combinations  When used in combina-
tion,  opioids  and  COX  inhibitors  have  additive  effects.  Because  a 
lower dose of each can be used to achieve the same degree of pain 
relief and their side effects are nonadditive, such combinations are 
used  to  lower  the  severity  of  dose-related  side  effects.  However, 
fixed-ratio  combinations  of  an  opioid  with  acetaminophen  carry 
an important risk. Dose escalation as a result of increased severity 
of pain or decreased opioid effect as a result of tolerance may lead 
to ingestion of levels of acetaminophen that are toxic to the liver. 
Although  acetaminophen-related  hepatotoxicity  is  uncommon,  it 
remains a significant cause for liver failure. Thus, many practition-
ers have moved away from the use of opioid-acetaminophen com-
bination  analgesics  to  avoid  the  risk  of  excessive  acetaminophen 
exposure as the dose of the analgesic is escalated.

CHRONIC PAIN
Managing patients with chronic pain is intellectually and emotionally 
challenging. Sensitization of the nervous system can occur without an 
obvious precipitating cause, e.g., fibromyalgia, or chronic headache. In 
many patients, chronic pain becomes a distinct disease unto itself. The 
pain-generating  mechanism  is  often  difficult  or  impossible  to  deter-
mine  with  certainty;  such  patients  are  demanding  of  the  physician’s 
time and often appear emotionally distraught. The traditional medical 
approach of seeking an obscure organic pathology is often unhelpful. 
On  the  other  hand,  psychological  evaluation  and  behaviorally  based 
treatment paradigms are frequently helpful, particularly in the setting 
of  a  multidisciplinary  pain-management  center.  Unfortunately,  this 
approach, while effective, remains largely underused in current med-
ical practice.

There  are  several  factors  that  can  cause,  perpetuate,  or  exacerbate 
chronic pain. First, of course, the patient may simply have a disease that 
is characteristically painful for which there is presently no cure. Arthritis, 
cancer, chronic daily headaches, fibromyalgia, and diabetic neuropathy 
are  examples  of  this.  Second,  there  may  be  secondary  perpetuating 
factors  that  are  initiated  by  disease  and  persist  after  that  disease  has 
resolved.  Examples  include  damaged  sensory  nerves,  sympathetic 
efferent activity, and painful reflex muscle contraction (spasm). Finally, 
a variety of psychological conditions can exacerbate or even cause pain.
There are certain areas to which special attention should be paid in 
a  patient’s  medical  history.  Because  depression  is  the  most  common 
emotional disturbance in patients with chronic pain, patients should be 
questioned about their mood, appetite, sleep patterns, and daily activ-
ity. A simple standardized questionnaire, such as the Beck Depression 
Inventory, can be a useful screening device. It is important to remem-
ber that major depression is a common, treatable, and potentially fatal 
illness.

Other clues that a significant emotional disturbance is contributing 
to a patient’s chronic pain complaint include pain that occurs in multi-
ple, unrelated sites; a pattern of recurrent, but separate, pain problems 
beginning  in  childhood  or  adolescence;  pain  beginning  at  a  time  of 
emotional trauma, such as the loss of a parent or spouse; a history of 
physical or sexual abuse; and past or present substance abuse.

On  examination,  special  attention  should  be  paid  to  whether  the 
patient guards the painful area and whether certain movements or pos-
tures are avoided because of pain. Discovering a mechanical compo-
nent to the pain can be useful both diagnostically and therapeutically. 
Painful areas should be examined for deep tenderness, noting whether 
this is localized to muscle, ligamentous structures, or joints. Chronic 
myofascial pain is very common, and in these patients, deep palpation 
may reveal highly localized trigger points that are firm bands or knots 
in muscle. Relief of the pain following injection of local anesthetic into 
these trigger points supports the diagnosis. A neuropathic component 
to the pain is indicated by evidence of nerve damage, such as sensory 
impairment, exquisitely sensitive skin (allodynia), weakness, and mus-
cle atrophy, or loss of deep tendon reflexes. Evidence suggesting sym-
pathetic nervous system involvement includes the presence of diffuse 

swelling,  changes  in  skin  color  and  temperature,  and  hypersensitive 
skin  and  joint  tenderness  compared  with  the  normal  side.  Relief  of 
the pain with a sympathetic block supports the diagnosis, but once the 
condition  becomes  chronic,  the  response  to  sympathetic  blockade  is 
of variable magnitude and duration; the role for repeated sympathetic 
blocks in the overall management of CRPS is unclear.

A  guiding  principle  in  evaluating  patients  with  chronic  pain  is  to 
assess  both  emotional  and  somatic  causal  and  perpetuating  factors 
before initiating therapy. Addressing these issues together, rather than 
waiting to address emotional issues after somatic causes of pain have 
been ruled out, improves compliance in part because it assures patients 
that  a  psychological  evaluation  does  not  mean  that  the  physician  is 
questioning the validity of their complaint. Even when a somatic cause 
for a patient’s pain can be found, it is still wise to look for other factors. 
For example, a cancer patient with painful bony metastases may have 
additional pain due to nerve damage and may also be depressed. Opti-
mal therapy requires that each of these factors be assessed and treated.

TREATMENT
Chronic Pain

Once  the  evaluation  process  has  been  completed  and  the  likely 
causative and exacerbating factors identified, an explicit treatment 
plan should be developed. An important part of this process is to 
identify specific and realistic functional goals for therapy, such as 
getting a good night’s sleep, being able to go shopping, or return-
ing  to  work.  A  multidisciplinary  approach  that  uses  medications, 
counseling,  physical  therapy,  nerve  blocks,  and  even  surgery  may 
be required to improve the patient’s quality of life. There are also 
some newer, minimally invasive procedures that can be helpful for 
some  patients  with  intractable  pain.  These  include  image-guided 
interventions such as epidural injection of glucocorticoids for acute 
radicular pain and radiofrequency treatment of the facet joints for 
chronic facet-related back and neck pain. For patients with severe 
and  persistent  pain  that  is  unresponsive  to  more  conservative 
treatment, placement of electrodes on peripheral nerves or within 
the spinal canal on nerve roots or in the space overlying the dorsal 
columns  of  the  spinal  cord  (spinal  cord  stimulation)  or  implan-
tation  of  intrathecal  drug-delivery  systems  has  shown  significant 
benefit. The criteria for predicting which patients will respond to 
these procedures continue to evolve. They are generally reserved for 
patients  who  have  not  responded  to  conventional  pharmacologic 
approaches.  Referral  to  a  multidisciplinary  pain  clinic  for  a  full 
evaluation  should  precede  any  invasive  procedure.  Such  referrals 
are  clearly  not  necessary  for  all  chronic  pain  patients.  For  some, 
pharmacologic management alone can provide adequate relief. 

ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS
The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), particularly nortriptyline and 
desipramine (Table 13-1), are useful for the management of chronic 
pain. Although developed for the treatment of depression, the TCAs 
have  a  spectrum  of  dose-related  biologic  activities  that  include 
analgesia in a variety of chronic clinical conditions. Although the 
mechanism  is  unknown,  the  analgesic  effect  of  TCAs  has  a  more 
rapid  onset  and  occurs  at  a  lower  dose  than  is  typically  required 
for the treatment of depression. Furthermore, patients with chronic 
pain who are not depressed obtain pain relief with antidepressants. 
There  is  evidence  that  TCAs  potentiate  opioid  analgesia,  so  they 
may be useful adjuncts for the treatment of severe persistent pain 
such as occurs with malignant tumors. Table 13-2 lists some of the 
painful  conditions  that  respond  to  TCAs.  TCAs  are  of  particular 
value  in  the  management  of  neuropathic  pain  such  as  occurs  in 
diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, for which there are 
few other therapeutic options.

The TCAs that have been shown to relieve pain have significant 
side  effects  (Table  13-1;  Chap.  452).  Some  of  these  side  effects,

such  as  orthostatic  hypotension,  drowsiness,  cardiac  conduction 
delay, memory impairment, constipation, and urinary retention, are 
particularly problematic in elderly patients, and several are additive 
to  the  side  effects  of  opioid  analgesics.  The  selective  serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine (Prozac) have fewer and less 
serious side effects than TCAs, but they are much less effective for 
relieving pain. It is of interest that venlafaxine (Effexor) and dulox-
etine (Cymbalta), which are nontricyclic antidepressants that block 
both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, appear to retain most 
of the pain-relieving effect of TCAs with a side effect profile more 
like that of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These drugs 
may be particularly useful in patients who cannot tolerate the side 
effects of TCAs. 
ANTICONVULSANTS AND ANTIARRHYTHMICS
These  drugs  are  useful  primarily  for  patients  with  neuropathic 
pain. Phenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) were first 
shown to relieve the pain of trigeminal neuralgia (Chap. 441). This 
pain has a characteristic brief, shooting, electric shock-like quality. 
In fact, anticonvulsants seem to be particularly helpful for pains that 
have such a lancinating quality. Newer anticonvulsants, the calcium 
channel alpha-2-delta subunit ligands gabapentin (Neurontin) and 
pregabalin (Lyrica), are effective for a broad range of neuropathic 
pains.  Furthermore,  because  of  their  favorable  side  effect  profile, 
these newer anticonvulsants are often used as first-line agents. 
CANNABINOIDS
These agents are widely used for their analgesic properties, although 
published evidence suggests that any effects are likely to be modest, 
with small increases in pain threshold reported and variable reduc-
tions in clinical pain intensity. Cannabis more consistently reduces 
the  unpleasantness  of  the  pain  experience  and,  in  cancer-related 
pain, can lessen the nausea and vomiting associated with chemo-
therapy  use.  Marijuana  and  related  compounds  are  discussed  in 
Chap. 455. 
CHRONIC OPIOID MEDICATION
The  long-term  use  of  opioids  is  accepted  for  patients  with  pain 
due  to  malignant  disease.  Although  opioid  use  for  chronic  pain 
of  nonmalignant  origin  is  controversial,  it  is  clear  that,  for  many 
patients, opioids are the only option that produces meaningful pain 
relief. This is understandable because opioids are the most potent 
and  have  the  broadest  range  of  efficacy  of  any  analgesic  medica-
tions. Although addiction is rare in patients who first use opioids 
for pain relief, some degree of tolerance and physical dependence 
is  likely  with  long-term  use.  Furthermore,  studies  suggest  that 
long-term  opioid  therapy  may  worsen  pain  in  some  individuals, 
termed  opioid-induced  hyperalgesia.  Therefore,  before  embarking 
on opioid therapy, other options should be explored, and the lim-
itations and risks of opioids should be explained to the patient. It is 
also important to point out that some opioid analgesic medications 
have  mixed  agonist-antagonist  properties  (e.g.,  butorphanol  and 
buprenorphine). From a practical standpoint, this means that they 

may worsen pain by inducing an abstinence syndrome in patients 
who are actively being treated with other opioids and are physically 
dependent.

With  long-term  outpatient  use  of  orally  administered  opioids, 
it  may  be  desirable  to  use  long-acting  compounds  such  as  levor-
phanol,  methadone,  extended-release  morphine  or  oxycodone,  or 
transdermal  fentanyl  (Table  13-1).  The  pharmacokinetic  profiles 
of  these  drug  preparations  enable  the  maintenance  of  sustained 
analgesic  blood  levels,  potentially  minimizing  side  effects  such 
as  sedation  that  are  associated  with  high  peak  plasma  levels,  and 
reducing the likelihood of rebound pain associated with a rapid fall 
in  plasma  opioid  concentration.  Extended-release  opioid  formu-
lations are approved primarily for patients who are already taking 
other opioids and should not be used as first-line opioids for pain. 
Although  long-acting  opioid  preparations  may  provide  superior 
pain  relief  in  patients  with  a  continuous  pattern  of  ongoing  pain, 
others suffer from intermittent severe episodic pain and experience 
superior pain control and fewer side effects with the periodic use of 
short-acting opioid analgesics. Constipation is a virtually universal 
side effect of opioid use and should be treated expectantly. As noted 
earlier in the discussion of acute pain treatment, a recent advance 
for patients is the development of peripherally acting opioid antag-
onists that can reverse the constipation associated with opioid use 
without interfering with analgesia.

Soon  after  the  introduction  of  an  extended-release  oxycodone 
formulation  (OxyContin)  in  the  late  1990s,  a  dramatic  rise  in 
emergency department visits and deaths associated with oxycodone 
ingestion appeared. This appears to be due primarily to individuals 
using  a  prescription  opioid  nonmedically.  Drug-induced  deaths 
have rapidly risen and are now the second leading cause of death 
in  Americans,  just  behind  motor  vehicle  fatalities.  In  2011,  the 
Office of National Drug Control Policy established a multifaceted 
approach  to  address  prescription  drug  abuse,  including  prescrip-
tion drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) that allow practitioners 
to  determine  if  patients  are  receiving  prescriptions  from  multiple 
providers  and  use  of  law  enforcement  to  eliminate  improper  pre-
scribing  practices.  In  2016,  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and 
Prevention  (CDC)  released  the  CDC  Guideline  for  Prescribing   
Opioids for Chronic Pain, with recommendations for primary care 
clinicians who are prescribing opioids for chronic noncancer pain. 
A modified approach to opioid prescribing was published in 2019 
by the Health and Human Services Task Force on chronic pain best 
medical  practices.  These  guidelines  address  (1)  when  to  initiate 
or continue opioids for chronic pain; (2) opioid selection, dosage, 
duration, follow-up, and discontinuation; and (3) assessing risk and 
addressing  harms  of  opioid  use.  The  recent  increase  in  scrutiny 
leaves  many  practitioners  hesitant  to  prescribe  opioid  analgesics, 
other than for brief periods to control pain associated with illness 
or  injury.  For  now,  the  choice  to  begin  chronic  opioid  therapy 
for a given patient is left to the individual practitioner. Pragmatic 
guidelines for properly selecting and monitoring patients receiving 
chronic  opioid  therapy  are  shown  in  Table  13-3;  a  checklist  for 
primary  care  clinicians  prescribing  opioids  for  noncancer  pain  is 
shown in Table 13-4. 

TREATMENT OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN
It is important to individualize treatment for patients with neuro-
pathic  pain.  Several  general  principles  should  guide  therapy:  the 
first is to move quickly to provide relief, and the second is to min-
imize drug side effects. For example, in patients with postherpetic 
neuralgia  and  significant  cutaneous  hypersensitivity,  topical  lido-
caine (Lidoderm patches) can provide immediate relief without side 
effects. The anticonvulsants gabapentin or pregabalin (see above) or 
antidepressants  (nortriptyline,  desipramine,  duloxetine,  or  venla-
faxine) can be used as first-line drugs for patients with neuropathic 
pain. Systemically administered antiarrhythmic drugs such as lido-
caine and mexiletine are less likely to be effective. Although intra-
venous infusion of lidocaine can provide analgesia for patients with 
different  types  of  neuropathic  pain,  the  relief  is  usually  transient,

TABLE 13-3  Guidelines for Selecting and Monitoring Patients 
Receiving Chronic Opioid Therapy (COT) for the Treatment of 
Chronic, Noncancer Pain
Patient Selection

•	 Conduct a history, physical examination, and appropriate testing, including an 

assessment of risk of substance abuse, misuse, or addiction.

•	 Consider a trial of COT if pain is moderate or severe, pain is having an adverse 

impact on function or quality of life, and potential therapeutic benefits 
outweigh potential harms.

•	 A benefit-to-harm evaluation, including a history, physical examination, and 
appropriate diagnostic testing, should be performed and documented before 
and on an ongoing basis during COT.

Informed Consent and Use of Management Plans

•	 Informed consent should be obtained. A continuing discussion with the 

patient regarding COT should include goals, expectations, potential risks, and 
alternatives to COT.

•	 Consider using a written COT management plan to document patient and 
clinician responsibilities and expectations and assist in patient education.

Initiation and Titration

•	 Initial treatment with opioids should be considered as a therapeutic trial to 

determine whether COT is appropriate.

•	 Opioid selection, initial dosing, and titration should be individualized according 

to the patient’s health status, previous exposure to opioids, attainment of 
therapeutic goals, and predicted or observed harms.

Monitoring

•	 Reassess patients on COT periodically and as warranted by changing 

circumstances. Monitoring should include documentation of pain intensity and 
level of functioning, assessments of progress toward achieving therapeutic 
goals, presence of adverse events, and adherence to prescribed therapies.
•	 In patients on COT who are at high risk or who have engaged in aberrant drug-
related behaviors, clinicians should periodically obtain urine drug screens or 
other information to confirm adherence to the COT plan of care.

•	 In patients on COT not at high risk and not known to have engaged in aberrant 
drug-related behaviors, clinicians should consider periodically obtaining urine 
drug screens or other information to confirm adherence to the COT plan of 
care.

typically lasting just hours after the cessation of the infusion. The 
oral  lidocaine  congener  mexiletine  is  poorly  tolerated,  producing 
frequent gastrointestinal adverse effects. There is no consensus on 
which class of drug should be used as a first-line treatment for any 
chronically  painful  condition.  However,  because  relatively  high 
doses of anticonvulsants are required for pain relief, sedation is not 
uncommon. Sedation is also a problem with TCAs but is much less 
of  a  problem  with  serotonin/norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors 
(SNRIs;  e.g.,  venlafaxine  and  duloxetine).  Thus,  in  the  elderly  or 
in patients whose daily activities require high-level mental activity, 
these drugs should be considered the first line. In contrast, opioid 
medications should be used as a second- or third-line drug class. 
Although highly effective for many painful conditions, opioids are 
sedating, and their effect tends to lessen over time, leading to dose 
escalation and, occasionally, a worsening of pain. A couple of inter-
esting alternatives to pure opioids are two drugs with mixed opioid 
and  norepinephrine  reuptake  action:  tramadol  and  tapentadol. 
Tramadol is a relatively weak opioid but is sometimes effective for 
pain unresponsive to nonopioid analgesics. Tapentadol is a stronger 
opioid, but its analgesic action is apparently enhanced by the nor-
epinephrine reuptake blockade. Similarly, drugs of different classes 
can  be  used  in  combination  to  optimize  pain  control.  Repeated 
injection of botulinum toxin is an emerging approach that is show-
ing  some  promise  in  treating  focal  neuropathic  pain,  particularly 
post-herpetic, trigeminal, and post-traumatic neuralgias.

It is worth emphasizing that many patients, especially those with 
chronic  pain,  seek  medical  attention  primarily  because  they  are

Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain
For Primary Care Providers Treating Adults (18+) with Chronic Pain  
≥3 months, Excluding Cancer, Palliative, and End-of-Life Care

CHECKLIST
WHEN CONSIDERING LONG-TERM OPIOID THERAPY
•	 Set realistic goals for pain and function based on diagnosis (e.g., walk around 

the block).

•	 Check that nonopioid therapies tried and optimized.
•	 Discuss benefits and risks (e.g., addiction, overdose) with patient.
•	 Evaluate risk of harm or misuse.

•	 Discuss risk factors with patient.
•	 Check prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data.
•	 Check urine drug screen.

•	 Set criteria for stopping or continuing opioids.
•	 Assess baseline pain and function (e.g., Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity 

[PEG] scale).

•	 Schedule initial reassessment within 1–4 weeks.
•	 Prescribe short-acting opioids using lowest dosage on product labeling; 

match duration to scheduled reassessment.

IF RENEWING WITHOUT A PATIENT VISIT
•	 Check that return visit is scheduled ≤3 months from last visit.
WHEN REASSESSING AT A PATIENT VISIT
•	 Continue opioids only after confirming clinically meaningful improvements in 

pain and function without significant risks or harm.

•	 Assess pain and function (e.g., PEG); compare results to baseline.
•	 Evaluate risk of harm or misuse:

•	 Observe patient for signs of oversedation or overdose risk. If yes: Taper 

dose.

•	 Check PDMP.
•	 Check for opioid use disorder if indicated (e.g., difficulty controlling use). If 

yes: Refer for treatment.

•	 Check that nonopioid therapies optimized. Determine whether to continue, 

adjust, taper, or stop opioids.

•	 Calculate opioid dosage morphine milligram equivalent (MME).

•	 If ≥50 MME/day total (≥50 mg hydrocodone; ≥33 mg oxycodone), increase 

frequency of follow-up; consider offering naloxone.

•	 Avoid ≥90 MME/day total (≥90 mg hydrocodone; ≥60 mg oxycodone), or 

carefully justify; consider specialist referral.

•	 Schedule reassessment at regular intervals (≤3 months).

suffering and because only physicians can provide the medications 
required for pain relief. A primary responsibility of all physicians 
is  to  minimize  the  physical  and  emotional  discomfort  of  their 
patients. Familiarity with pain mechanisms and analgesic medica-
tions is an important step toward accomplishing this aim.

14 Chest Discomfort

David A. Morrow

Chest  discomfort  is  among  the  most  common  reasons  for  which 
patients present for medical attention at either an emergency depart-
ment  (ED)  or  an  outpatient  clinic.  The  evaluation  of  nontraumatic 
chest discomfort is inherently challenging owing to the broad variety 
of possible causes, a minority of which are life-threatening conditions 
that should not be missed. It is helpful to frame the initial diagnostic 
assessment and triage of patients with acute chest discomfort around 
three categories: (1) myocardial ischemia; (2) other cardiopulmonary 
causes  (myopericardial  disease,  aortic  emergencies,  and  pulmonary 
conditions);  and  (3)  noncardiopulmonary  causes.  Although  rapid 
identification of high-risk conditions is a priority of the initial assess-
ment, strategies that incorporate routine liberal use of testing carry the 
potential for adverse effects of unnecessary investigations.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY
Chest discomfort is one of the three most common reason for visits to 
the ED in the United States, resulting in 6 to 7 million emergency visits 
each year. More than 60% of patients with this presentation are hospi-
talized  for  further  testing,  and  most  of  the  remainder  undergo  addi-
tional investigation in the ED. Fewer than 15% of evaluated patients are 
eventually diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with rates 
of 10–20% in most series of unselected populations, and a rate as low as 
5% in some studies. The most common diagnoses are gastrointestinal 
causes (Fig. 14-1), and as few as 5% are other life-threatening cardio-
pulmonary conditions. In a large proportion of patients with transient 
acute chest discomfort, ACS or another acute cardiopulmonary cause is 
excluded but the cause is not determined. Therefore, the resources and 
time devoted to the evaluation of chest discomfort in the absence of a 
severe cause are substantial. Nevertheless, historically, a disconcerting 
2–6% of patients with chest discomfort of presumed nonischemic eti-
ology who are discharged from the ED were later deemed to have had a 
missed myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with a missed diagnosis of 
MI have a 30-day risk of death that is double that of their counterparts 
who are hospitalized.

The  natural  histories  of  ACS,  myocarditis,  acute  pericardial  dis-
eases, pulmonary embolism, and aortic emergencies are discussed in  
Chaps. 270, 273, 274, 275, 279, and 280, respectively. In a study of more 
than 350,000 patients with unspecified presumed noncardiopulmonary 
chest discomfort, the mortality rate 1 year after discharge was <2% and 
did not differ significantly from age-adjusted mortality in the general 

population. The estimated rate of major cardiovascular events through 
30 days in patients with acute chest pain who had been stratified as low 
risk was 2.5% in a large population-based study that excluded patients 
with ST-segment elevation or definite noncardiac chest pain.

CAUSES OF CHEST DISCOMFORT
The major etiologies of chest discomfort are discussed in this section 
and  summarized  in  Table  14-1.  Additional  elements  of  the  history, 
physical  examination,  and  diagnostic  testing  that  aid  in  distinguish-
ing these causes are discussed in a later section (see “Approach to the 
Patient”).
 ■ MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA/INJURY
Myocardial  ischemia  causing  chest  discomfort,  termed  angina  pec-
toris,  is  a  primary  clinical  concern  in  patients  presenting  with  chest 
symptoms.  Myocardial  ischemia  is  precipitated  by  an  imbalance 
between  myocardial  oxygen  requirements  and  myocardial  oxygen 
supply, resulting in insufficient delivery of oxygen to meet the heart’s 
metabolic demands. Myocardial oxygen consumption may be elevated 
by increases in heart rate, ventricular wall stress, and myocardial con-
tractility, whereas myocardial oxygen supply is determined by coronary 
blood  flow  and  coronary  arterial  oxygen  content.  When  myocardial 
ischemia  is  sufficiently  severe  and  prolonged  in  duration  (as  little  as  
20 min), irreversible cellular injury occurs, resulting in MI.

Ischemic heart disease is most commonly caused by atheromatous 
plaque that obstructs one or more of the epicardial coronary arteries. 
Stable  ischemic  heart  disease  (Chap.  273)  usually  results  from  the 
gradual  atherosclerotic  narrowing  of  the  coronary  arteries.  Stable 
angina is characterized by ischemic episodes that are typically precip-
itated by a superimposed increase in oxygen demand during physical 
exertion  and  relieved  upon  resting.  Ischemic  heart  disease  becomes 
unstable,  manifest  by  ischemia  at  rest  or  with  an  escalating  pattern, 
most commonly when rupture or erosion of one or more atheroscle-
rotic  lesions  triggers  coronary  thrombosis.  Unstable  ischemic  heart 
disease  is  further  classified  clinically  by  the  presence  or  absence  of 
detectable  acute  myocardial  injury  and  the  presence  or  absence  of 
ST-segment elevation on the patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG). When 
acute coronary atherothrombosis occurs, the intracoronary thrombus 
may be partially obstructive, generally leading to myocardial ischemia 
in the absence of ST-segment elevation. Unstable ischemic heart dis-
ease is classified as unstable angina when there is no detectable acute 
myocardial injury and as non–ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) when there is 
evidence of acute myocardial necrosis (Chap. 274). When the coronary 
thrombus is acutely and completely occlusive, transmural myocardial 
ischemia usually ensues, with ST-segment elevation on the ECG and 
myocardial necrosis leading to a diagnosis of ST elevation MI (STEMI; 
see Chap. 275).

Clinicians  should  be  aware  that  unstable  ischemic  symptoms  may 
also  occur  predominantly  because  of  increased  myocardial  oxygen 
demand  (e.g.,  during  intense  psychological  stress  or  fever)  or  because 
of decreased oxygen delivery due to anemia, hypoxia, or hypotension. 
However, the term acute coronary syndrome, which encompasses unsta-
ble  angina,  NSTEMI,  and  STEMI,  is  in  general  reserved  for  ischemia 
precipitated by acute coronary atherothrombosis. In order to guide ther-
apeutic strategies, a standardized system for classification of MI has been 
expanded to discriminate MI resulting from acute coronary thrombosis 
(type 1 MI) from MI occurring secondary to other imbalances of myo-
cardial oxygen supply and demand (type 2 MI; see Chap. 274). These 
conditions are additionally distinguished from nonischemic causes of 
acute myocardial injury, such as myocarditis.

Other  contributors  to  stable  and  unstable  ischemic  heart  disease, 
such  as  endothelial  dysfunction,  microvascular  disease,  and  vaso-
spasm,  may  exist  alone  or  in  combination  with  coronary  atheroscle-
rosis and may be the dominant cause of myocardial ischemia in some 
patients. Moreover, nonatherosclerotic processes, including congenital 
abnormalities  of  the  coronary  vessels,  myocardial  bridging,  coronary 
arteritis, and radiation-induced coronary disease, can lead to coronary 
obstruction.  In  addition,  conditions  associated  with  extreme  myo-
cardial  oxygen  demand  and  impaired  endocardial  blood  flow,  such 
as aortic valve disease (Chap. 280), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or 
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (Chap. 259), can precipitate myo-
cardial  ischemia  in  patients  with  or  without  underlying  obstructive 
atherosclerosis.

102 Characteristics  of  Ischemic  Chest  Discomfort  The  clinical 
characteristics of angina pectoris, often referred to simply as “angina,” 
are highly similar whether the ischemic discomfort is a manifestation 
of stable ischemic heart disease, unstable angina, or MI; the exceptions 
are  differences  in  the  pattern  and  duration  of  symptoms  associated 
with  these  syndromes  (Table  14-1).  Heberden  initially  described 
angina as a sense of “strangling and anxiety.” Chest discomfort charac-
teristic of myocardial ischemia is typically described as aching, heavy, 
squeezing, crushing, or constricting. However, in a substantial minor-
ity of patients, the quality of discomfort is extremely vague and may be 
described as a mild tightness, or merely an uncomfortable feeling, that 
sometimes  is  experienced  as  numbness  or  a  burning  sensation.  The 
site of the discomfort is usually retrosternal, but radiation is common 
and generally occurs down the ulnar surface of the left arm; the right 
arm, both arms, neck, jaw, or shoulders may also be involved. These 
and  other  characteristics  of  ischemic  chest  discomfort  pertinent  to 
discrimination from other causes of chest pain are discussed later in 
this chapter (see “Approach to the Patient”).

Stable  angina  usually  begins  gradually  and  reaches  its  maximal 
intensity  over  a  period  of  minutes  before  dissipating  within  several 
minutes  with  rest  or  with  nitroglycerin.  The  discomfort  typically 
occurs  predictably  at  a  characteristic  level  of  exertion  or  psychologi-
cal stress. By definition, unstable angina is manifest by anginal chest 
discomfort  that  occurs  with  progressively  lower  intensity  of  physical 
activity or even at rest. Chest discomfort associated with MI is com-
monly more severe, is prolonged (usually lasting ≥30 min), and is not 
relieved by rest.

Mechanisms  of  Cardiac  Pain  The  neural  pathways  involved  in 
ischemic  cardiac  pain  are  poorly  understood.  Ischemic  episodes  are 
thought to excite local chemosensitive and mechanoreceptive receptors 
that, in turn, stimulate release of adenosine, bradykinin, and other sub-
stances that activate the sensory ends of sympathetic and vagal afferent 
fibers. The afferent fibers traverse the nerves that connect to the upper 
five thoracic sympathetic ganglia and upper five distal thoracic roots of 
the spinal cord. From there, impulses are transmitted to the thalamus. 
Within  the  spinal  cord,  cardiac  sympathetic  afferent  impulses  may 
converge  with  impulses  from  somatic  thoracic  structures,  and  this 
convergence  may  be  the  basis  for  referred  cardiac  pain.  In  addition, 
cardiac  vagal  afferent  fibers  synapse  in  the  nucleus  tractus  solitarius 
of the medulla and then descend to the upper cervical spinothalamic 
tract, and this route may contribute to anginal pain experienced in the 
neck and jaw.

 ■ OTHER CARDIOPULMONARY CAUSES
Pericardial and Other Myocardial Diseases (See also Chap. 270)  
Inflammation  of  the  pericardium  due  to  infectious  or  noninfectious 
causes can be responsible for acute or chronic chest discomfort. The 
visceral  surface  and  most  of  the  parietal  surface  of  the  pericardium 
are  insensitive  to  pain.  Therefore,  the  pain  of  pericarditis  is  thought 
to  arise  principally  from  associated  pleural  inflammation.  Because 
of  this  pleural  association,  the  discomfort  of  pericarditis  is  usually 
pleuritic  pain  that  is  exacerbated  by  breathing,  coughing,  or  changes 
in position. Moreover, owing to the overlapping sensory supply of the 
central  diaphragm  via  the  phrenic  nerve  with  somatic  sensory  fibers 
originating in the third to fifth cervical segments, the pain of pleural 
and  pericardial  inflammation  is  often  referred  to  the  shoulder  and 
neck. Involvement of the pleural surface of the lateral diaphragm can 
lead to pain in the upper abdomen.

Acute  inflammatory  and  other  nonischemic  myocardial  diseases 
can  also  produce  chest  discomfort.  The  symptoms  of  acute  myocar-
ditis  are  highly  varied.  Chest  discomfort  may  either  originate  with 
inflammatory injury of the myocardium or be due to severe increases 
in wall stress related to poor ventricular performance. The symptoms 
of  Takotsubo  (stress-related)  cardiomyopathy  often  start  abruptly  with 
chest pain and shortness of breath. This form of cardiomyopathy, in its 
most  recognizable  form,  is  triggered  by  an  emotionally  or  physically 
stressful  event  and  may  mimic  acute  MI  because  of  its  commonly 

associated  ECG  abnormalities,  including  ST-segment  elevation,  and 
elevated biomarkers of myocardial injury. Observational studies sup-
port a predilection for women >50 years of age.

Diseases of the Aorta (See also Chap. 280)  Acute aortic dis-
section (Fig. 14-1) is a less common cause of chest discomfort but is 
important because of the catastrophic natural history of certain subsets 
of cases when recognized late or left untreated. Acute aortic syndromes 
encompass  a  spectrum  of  acute  aortic  diseases  related  to  disruption 
of the media of the aortic wall. Aortic dissection involves a tear in the 
aortic  intima,  resulting  in  separation  of  the  media  and  creation  of  a 
separate “false” lumen. A penetrating ulcer has been described as ulcer-
ation of an aortic atheromatous plaque that extends through the intima 
and into the aortic media, with the potential to initiate an intramedial 
dissection  or  rupture  into  the  adventitia.  Intramural  hematoma  is  an 
aortic wall hematoma with no demonstrable intimal flap, no radiolog-
ically apparent intimal tear, and no false lumen. Intramural hematoma 
can occur due to either rupture of the vasa vasorum or, less commonly, 
a penetrating ulcer.

Each of these subtypes of acute aortic syndrome typically presents 
with  chest  discomfort  that  is  often  severe,  sudden  in  onset,  and 
sometimes  described  as  “tearing”  in  quality.  Acute  aortic  syndromes 
involving  the  ascending  aorta  tend  to  cause  pain  in  the  midline  of 
the  anterior  chest,  whereas  descending  aortic  syndromes  most  often 
present with pain in the back. Therefore, dissections that begin in the 
ascending aorta and extend to the descending aorta tend to cause pain 
in  the  front  of  the  chest  that  extends  toward  the  back,  between  the 
shoulder blades. Proximal aortic dissections that involve the ascending 
aorta (type A in the Stanford nomenclature) are at high risk for major 
complications  that  may  influence  the  clinical  presentation,  including  
(1) compromise of the aortic ostia of the coronary arteries, resulting 
in  MI;  (2)  disruption  of  the  aortic  valve,  causing  acute  aortic  insuf-
ficiency; and (3) rupture of the hematoma into the pericardial space, 
leading to pericardial tamponade.

Knowledge  of  the  epidemiology  of  acute  aortic  syndromes  can  be 
helpful  in  maintaining  awareness  of  this  relatively  uncommon  group 
of disorders (estimated annual incidence, 3 cases per 100,000 popula-
tion). Nontraumatic aortic dissections are very rare in the absence of 
hypertension or conditions associated with deterioration of the elastic 
or  muscular  components  of  the  aortic  media,  including  pregnancy, 
bicuspid aortic disease, or inherited connective tissue diseases, such as 
Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes.

Although aortic aneurysms are most often asymptomatic, thoracic 
aortic aneurysms can cause chest pain and other symptoms by com-
pressing  adjacent  structures.  This  pain  tends  to  be  steady,  deep,  and 
occasionally  severe.  Aortitis,  whether  of  noninfectious  or  infectious 
etiology, in the absence of aortic dissection is a rare cause of chest or 
back discomfort.

Pulmonary  Conditions  Pulmonary  and  pulmonary-vascular 
conditions  that  cause  chest  discomfort  usually  do  so  in  conjunction 
with dyspnea and often produce symptoms that have a pleuritic nature.
PULMONARY  EMBOLISM  (SEE  ALSO  CHAP.  279)  Pulmonary  emboli 
(annual incidence, ~1 per 1000) can produce dyspnea and chest dis-
comfort that is sudden in onset. Typically pleuritic in pattern, the chest 
discomfort  associated  with  pulmonary  embolism  may  result  from  
(1) involvement of the pleural surface of the lung adjacent to a resul-
tant pulmonary infarction; (2) distention of the pulmonary artery; or  
(3) possibly, right ventricular wall stress and/or subendocardial ische-
mia related to acute pulmonary hypertension. The pain associated with 
small pulmonary emboli is often lateral and pleuritic and is believed to 
be related to the first of these three possible mechanisms. In contrast, 
massive pulmonary emboli may cause severe substernal pain that may 
mimic an MI and that is plausibly attributed to the second and third 
of  these  potential  mechanisms.  Massive  or  submassive  pulmonary 
embolism may also be associated with syncope, hypotension, and signs 
of right heart failure. Other typical characteristics that aid in the recog-
nition of pulmonary embolism are discussed later in this chapter (see 
“Approach to the Patient”).

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesPNEUMOTHORAX  (SEE  ALSO  CHAP.  294)  Primary  spontaneous  pneu-
mothorax is a rare cause of chest discomfort, with an estimated annual 
incidence  in  the  United  States  of  7  per  100,000  among  men  and  
<2 per 100,000 among women. Risk factors include male sex, smoking, 
family history, and Marfan syndrome. The symptoms are usually sud-
den in onset, and dyspnea may be mild; thus, presentation to medical 
attention is sometimes delayed. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax 
may occur in patients with underlying lung disorders, such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or cystic fibrosis, and usually 
produces symptoms that are more severe. Tension pneumothorax is a 
medical  emergency  caused  by  trapped  intrathoracic  air  that  precipi-
tates hemodynamic collapse.

Other Pulmonary Parenchymal, Pleural, or Vascular Disease 
(See also Chaps. 283, 284, and 294)  Most pulmonary diseases 
that  produce  chest  pain,  including  pneumonia  and  malignancy,  do 
so  because  of  involvement  of  the  pleura  or  surrounding  structures. 
Pleurisy is typically described as a knifelike pain that is worsened by 
inspiration or coughing. In contrast, chronic pulmonary hypertension 
can  manifest  as  chest  pain  that  may  be  very  similar  to  angina  in  its 
characteristics,  suggesting  right  ventricular  myocardial  ischemia  in 
some cases. Reactive airways diseases similarly can cause chest tight-
ness associated with breathlessness rather than pleurisy.

 ■ NONCARDIOPULMONARY CAUSES
Gastrointestinal Conditions (See also Chap. 321)  Gastroin-
testinal disorders are the most common cause of nontraumatic chest 
discomfort  and  often  produce  symptoms  that  are  difficult  to  discern 
from more serious causes of chest pain, including myocardial ischemia. 
Esophageal disorders, in particular, may simulate angina in the charac-
ter and location of the pain. Gastroesophageal reflux and disorders of 
esophageal motility are common and should be considered in the dif-
ferential diagnosis of chest pain (Fig. 14-1 and Table 14-1). The pain of 
esophageal spasm is commonly an intense, squeezing discomfort that 
is retrosternal in location and, like angina, may be relieved by nitro-
glycerin  or  dihydropyridine  calcium  channel  antagonists.  Chest  pain 
can also result from injury to the esophagus, such as a Mallory-Weiss 
tear or even an esophageal rupture (Boerhaave’s syndrome) caused by 
severe vomiting. Peptic ulcer disease is most commonly epigastric in 
location but can radiate into the chest (Table 14-1).

Hepatobiliary  disorders,  including  cholecystitis  and  biliary  colic, 
may mimic acute cardiopulmonary diseases. Although the pain arising 
from these disorders usually localizes to the right upper quadrant of the 
abdomen, it is variable and may be felt in the epigastrium and radiate 
to  the  back  and  lower  chest.  This  discomfort  is  sometimes  referred 
to the scapula or may in rare cases be felt in the shoulder, suggesting 
diaphragmatic irritation. The pain is steady, usually lasts several hours, 
and subsides spontaneously, without symptoms between attacks. Pain 
resulting from pancreatitis is typically aching epigastric pain that radi-
ates to the back.

Musculoskeletal  and  Other  Causes  (See  also  Chap.  360)  
Chest  discomfort  can  be  produced  by  any  musculoskeletal  disorder 
involving the chest wall or the nerves of the chest wall, neck, or upper 
limbs. Costochondritis causing tenderness of the costochondral junc-
tions (Tietze’s syndrome) is relatively common. Cervical radiculitis may 
manifest  as  a  prolonged  or  constant  aching  discomfort  in  the  upper 
chest and limbs. The pain may be exacerbated by motion of the neck. 
Occasionally, chest pain can be caused by compression of the brachial 
plexus by the cervical ribs, and tendinitis or bursitis involving the left 
shoulder  may  mimic  the  radiation  of  angina.  Pain  in  a  dermatomal 
distribution can also be caused by cramping of intercostal muscles or 
by herpes zoster (Chap. 193).

Emotional  and  Psychiatric  Conditions  As  many  as  10%  of 
patients who present to EDs with acute chest discomfort have a panic 
disorder or related condition (Table 14-1). The symptoms may include 
chest tightness or aching that is associated with a sense of anxiety and 
difficulty breathing. The symptoms may be prolonged or fleeting.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Chest Discomfort

Given  the  broad  set  of  potential  causes  and  the  heterogeneous 
risk  of  serious  complications  in  patients  who  present  with  acute 
nontraumatic  chest  discomfort,  the  priorities  of  the  initial  clinical 
encounter  include  assessment  of  (1)  the  patient’s  clinical  stability 
and (2) the probability that the patient has an underlying cause of 
the  discomfort  that  may  be  life-threatening.  The  high-risk  condi-
tions  of  principal  concern  are  acute  cardiopulmonary  processes, 
including ACS, acute aortic syndrome, pulmonary embolism, ten-
sion  pneumothorax,  and  pericarditis  with  tamponade.  Fulminant 
myocarditis also carries a poor prognosis but is usually also manifest 
by heart failure symptoms. Among noncardiopulmonary causes of 
chest pain, esophageal rupture likely holds the greatest urgency for 
diagnosis.  Patients  with  these  conditions  may  deteriorate  rapidly 
despite initially appearing well. The remaining population with non-
cardiopulmonary conditions has a more favorable prognosis during 
completion of the diagnostic workup. A rapid targeted assessment 
for  a  serious  cardiopulmonary  cause  is  of  particular  relevance  for 
patients with acute ongoing pain who have presented for emergency 
evaluation.  Among  patients  presenting  in  the  outpatient  setting 
with  chronic  pain  or  pain  that  has  resolved,  a  general  diagnostic 
assessment is reasonably undertaken (see “Outpatient Evaluation of 
Chest Discomfort,” below). A series of questions that can be used to 
structure the clinical evaluation of patients with chest discomfort is 
shown in Table 14-2. 
HISTORY
The evaluation of nontraumatic chest discomfort relies heavily on 
the clinical history and physical examination to direct subsequent 
diagnostic testing. The evaluating clinician should assess the qual-
ity, location (including radiation), and pattern (including onset and 
duration) of the pain as well as any provoking or alleviating factors. 
The presence of associated symptoms may also be useful in estab-
lishing a diagnosis. 
Quality  of  Pain  The  quality  of  chest  discomfort  alone  is  never 
sufficient  to  establish  a  diagnosis.  However,  the  characteristics  of 
the  pain  are  pivotal  in  formulating  an  initial  clinical  impression 
and assessing the likelihood of a serious cardiopulmonary process

FIGURE  14-2  Association  of  chest  pain  characteristics  with  the  probability  of  acute  myocardial  infarction  (AMI).  Note  that  a  subsequent  larger  study  showed  a 
nonsignificant association with radiation to the right arm. (Figure prepared from data in CJ Swap, JT Nagurney: JAMA 294:2623, 2005.)

(Table  14-1),  including  ACS  in  particular  (Fig.  14-2).  Pressure  or 
tightness  is  consistent  with  a  typical  presentation  of  myocardial 
ischemic pain. Nevertheless, the clinician must remember that some 
patients with ischemic chest symptoms deny any “pain” but rather 
complain of dyspnea or a vague sense of anxiety. The severity of the 
discomfort  has  poor  diagnostic  accuracy.  It  is  often  helpful  to  ask 
about the similarity of the discomfort to previous definite ischemic 
symptoms. It is unusual for angina to be sharp, as in knifelike, stab-
bing, or pleuritic; however, patients sometimes use the word “sharp” 
to convey the intensity of discomfort rather than the quality. Pleuritic 
discomfort is suggestive of a process involving the pleura, including 
pericarditis,  pulmonary  embolism,  or  pulmonary  parenchymal 
processes. Less frequently, the pain of pericarditis or massive pul-
monary embolism is a steady severe pressure or aching that can be 
difficult  to  discriminate  from  myocardial  ischemia.  “Tearing”  or 
“ripping” pain is often described by patients with acute aortic dis-
section. However, acute aortic emergencies also present commonly 
with  knifelike  pain.  A  burning  quality  can  suggest  acid  reflux  or 
peptic ulcer disease but may also occur with myocardial ischemia. 
Esophageal pain, particularly with spasm, can be a severe squeezing 
discomfort identical to angina. 
Location  of  Discomfort  A  substernal  location  with  radiation  to 
the neck, jaw, shoulder, or arms is typical of myocardial ischemic 
discomfort. Radiation to both arms has a particularly high associa-
tion with MI as the etiology. Some patients present with aching in 
sites of radiated pain as their only symptoms of ischemia. However, 
pain that is highly localized—e.g., that which can be demarcated by 
the tip of one finger—is highly unusual for angina. A retrosternal 
location should prompt consideration of esophageal pain; however, 
other  gastrointestinal  conditions  usually  present  with  pain  that  is 
most intense in the abdomen or epigastrium, with possible radia-
tion into the chest. Angina may also occur in an epigastric location. 
Pain that occurs solely above the mandible or below the epigastrium 
is  rarely  angina.  Severe  pain  radiating  to  the  back,  particularly 
between  the  shoulder  blades,  should  prompt  consideration  of  an 
acute aortic syndrome. Radiation to the trapezius ridge is charac-
teristic of pericardial pain and does not usually occur with angina. 

Pattern  Myocardial ischemic discomfort usually builds over min-
utes and is exacerbated by activity and mitigated by rest. In contrast, 
pain that reaches its peak intensity immediately is more suggestive 
of  aortic  dissection,  pulmonary  embolism,  or  spontaneous  pneu-
mothorax. Pain that is fleeting (lasting only a few seconds) is rarely 
ischemic in origin. Similarly, pain that is constant in intensity for 
a  prolonged  period  (many  hours  to  days)  is  unlikely  to  represent 
myocardial ischemia if it occurs in the absence of other clinical con-
sequences, such as abnormalities of the ECG, elevation of cardiac 
biomarkers, or clinical sequelae (e.g., heart failure or hypotension). 
Both myocardial ischemia and acid reflux may have their onset in 
the morning. 
Provoking  and  Alleviating  Factors  Patients  with  myocardial 
ischemic pain usually prefer to rest, sit, or stop walking. However, 
clinicians should be aware of the phenomenon of “warm-up angina” 
in which some patients experience relief of angina as they continue 
at the same or even a greater level of exertion (Chap. 273). Altera-
tions in the intensity of pain with changes in position or movement 
of  the  upper  extremities  and  neck  are  less  likely  with  myocardial 
ischemia and suggest a musculoskeletal etiology. The pain of peri-
carditis, however, often is worse in the supine position and relieved 
by  sitting  upright  and  leaning  forward.  Gastroesophageal  reflux 
may be exacerbated by alcohol, some foods, or a reclined position. 
Relief can occur with sitting.

Exacerbation by eating suggests a gastrointestinal etiology such 
as  peptic  ulcer  disease,  cholecystitis,  or  pancreatitis.  Peptic  ulcer 
disease tends to become symptomatic 60–90 min after meals. How-
ever, in the setting of severe coronary atherosclerosis, redistribution 
of blood flow to the splanchnic vasculature after eating can trigger 
postprandial angina. The discomfort of acid reflux and peptic ulcer 
disease is usually diminished promptly by acid-reducing therapies. 
In contrast with its impact in some patients with angina, physical 
exertion  is  very  unlikely  to  alter  symptoms  from  gastrointestinal 
causes  of  chest  pain.  Relief  of  chest  discomfort  within  minutes 
after administration of nitroglycerin is suggestive of but not suffi-
ciently sensitive or specific for a definitive diagnosis of myocardial 
ischemia.  Esophageal  spasm  may  also  be  relieved  promptly  with 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   104

21/01/22   3:36 PM

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesnitroglycerin.  A  delay  of  >10  min  before  relief  is  obtained  after 
nitroglycerin suggests that the symptoms either are not caused by 
ischemia or are caused by severe ischemia, such as during acute MI. 
Associated  Symptoms  Symptoms  that  accompany  myocardial 
ischemia may include diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, faint-
ness, and eructations. In addition, these symptoms may exist in iso-
lation as anginal equivalents (i.e., symptoms of myocardial ischemia 
other than typical angina), particularly in women and the elderly. 
Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the dif-
ferential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but 
the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardio-
pulmonary etiology. Sudden onset of significant respiratory distress 
should  lead  to  consideration  of  pulmonary  embolism  and  spon-
taneous  pneumothorax.  Hemoptysis  may  occur  with  pulmonary 
embolism or as blood-tinged frothy sputum in severe heart failure 
but  usually  points  toward  a  pulmonary  parenchymal  etiology  of 
chest symptoms. Presentation with syncope or presyncope should 
prompt  consideration  of  hemodynamically  significant  pulmonary 
embolism  or  aortic  dissection  as  well  as  ischemic  arrhythmias. 
Although nausea and vomiting suggest a gastrointestinal disorder, 
these symptoms may occur in the setting of MI (more commonly 
inferior  MI),  presumably  because  of  activation  of  the  vagal  reflex 
or  stimulation  of  left  ventricular  receptors  as  part  of  the  Bezold-
Jarisch reflex. 
Past Medical History  The past medical history is useful in assess-
ing  the  patient  for  risk  factors  for  coronary  atherosclerosis  and 
venous  thromboembolism  (Chap.  279)  as  well  as  for  conditions 
that may predispose the patient to specific disorders. For example, 
a  history  of  connective  tissue  diseases  such  as  Marfan  syndrome 
should  heighten  the  clinician’s  suspicion  of  an  acute  aortic  syn-
drome or spontaneous pneumothorax. A careful history may elicit 
clues about depression or prior panic attacks. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
In addition to providing an initial assessment of the patient’s clinical 
stability, the physical examination of patients with chest discomfort 
can  provide  direct  evidence  of  specific  etiologies  of  chest  pain 
(e.g., unilateral absence of lung sounds) and can identify potential 
precipitants  of  acute  cardiopulmonary  causes  of  chest  pain  (e.g., 
uncontrolled  hypertension),  relevant  comorbid  conditions  (e.g., 
obstructive pulmonary disease), and complications of the present-
ing  syndrome  (e.g.,  heart  failure).  However,  because  the  findings 
on physical examination may be normal in patients with unstable 
ischemic heart disease, an unremarkable physical exam is not defin-
itively reassuring. 
General  The patient’s general appearance is helpful in establish-
ing  an  initial  impression  of  the  severity  of  illness.  Patients  with 
acute  MI  or  other  acute  cardiopulmonary  disorders  often  appear 
anxious,  uncomfortable,  pale,  cyanotic,  or  diaphoretic.  Patients 
who  are  massaging  or  clutching  their  chests  may  describe  their 
pain  with  a  clenched  fist  held  against  the  sternum  (Levine’s  sign). 
Occasionally, body habitus is helpful—e.g., in patients with Marfan 
syndrome or the prototypical young, tall, thin man with spontane-
ous pneumothorax. 
Vital Signs  Significant tachycardia and hypotension are indicative 
of important hemodynamic consequences of the underlying cause 
of chest discomfort and should prompt a rapid survey for the most 
severe conditions, such as acute MI with cardiogenic shock, mas-
sive pulmonary embolism, pericarditis with tamponade, or tension 
pneumothorax.  Acute  aortic  emergencies  usually  present  with 
severe hypertension but may be associated with profound hypoten-
sion when there is coronary arterial compromise or dissection into 
the pericardium. Sinus tachycardia is an important manifestation of 
submassive pulmonary embolism. Tachypnea and hypoxemia point 
toward a pulmonary cause. The presence of low-grade fever is non-
specific because it may occur with MI and with thromboembolism 
in addition to infection.

Pulmonary  Examination  of  the  lungs  may  localize  a  primary 
pulmonary  cause  of  chest  discomfort,  as  in  cases  of  pneumonia, 
asthma, or pneumothorax. Left ventricular dysfunction from severe 
ischemia/infarction as well as acute valvular complications of MI or 
aortic dissection can lead to pulmonary edema, which is an indica-
tor of high risk. 
Cardiac  The jugular venous pulse is often normal in patients with 
acute  myocardial  ischemia  but  may  reveal  characteristic  patterns 
with pericardial tamponade or acute right ventricular dysfunction 
(Chaps. 239 and 270). Cardiac auscultation may reveal a third or, 
more commonly, a fourth heart sound, reflecting myocardial sys-
tolic or diastolic dysfunction. Murmurs of mitral regurgitation or a 
ventricular-septal defect may indicate mechanical complications of 
STEMI. A murmur of aortic insufficiency may be a complication of 
ascending aortic dissection. Other murmurs may reveal underlying 
cardiac disorders contributory to ischemia (e.g., aortic stenosis or 
hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy).  Pericardial  friction  rubs  reflect 
pericardial inflammation. 
Abdominal  Localizing  tenderness  on  the  abdominal  exam  is 
useful  in  identifying  a  gastrointestinal  cause  of  the  presenting 
syndrome.  Abdominal  findings  are  infrequent  with  purely  acute 
cardiopulmonary problems, except in the case of right-sided heart 
failure leading to hepatic congestion.
Extremities  Vascular pulse deficits may reflect underlying chronic 
atherosclerosis, which increases the likelihood of coronary artery dis-
ease. However, evidence of acute limb ischemia with loss of the pulse 
and  pallor,  particularly  in  the  upper  extremities,  can  indicate  cata-
strophic consequences of aortic dissection. Unilateral lower-extremity 
swelling should raise suspicion about venous thromboembolism. 
Musculoskeletal  Pain arising from the costochondral and chon-
drosternal articulations may be associated with localized swelling, 
redness, or marked localized tenderness. Pain on palpation of these 
joints is usually well localized and is a useful clinical sign, although 
deep  palpation  may  elicit  pain  in  the  absence  of  costochondritis. 
Although  palpation  of  the  chest  wall  often  elicits  pain  in  patients 
with  various  musculoskeletal  conditions,  it  should  be  appreciated 
that  chest  wall  tenderness  does  not  exclude  myocardial  ischemia. 
Sensory deficits in the upper extremities may be indicative of cer-
vical disk disease. 
ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY
Electrocardiography  is  crucial  in  the  evaluation  of  nontraumatic 
chest discomfort. The ECG is pivotal for identifying patients with 
ongoing ischemia as the principal reason for their presentation as 
well  as  secondary  cardiac  complications  of  other  disorders.  Pro-
fessional  society  guidelines  recommend  that  an  ECG  be  obtained 
within  10  min  of  presentation,  with  the  primary  goal  of  identi-
fying  patients  with  ST-segment  elevation  diagnostic  of  MI  who 
are  candidates  for  immediate  interventions  to  restore  flow  in  the 
occluded  coronary  artery.  ST-segment  depression  and  symmetric 
T-wave inversions at least 0.2 mV in depth are useful for detecting  
myocardial ischemia in the absence of STEMI and are also indic-
ative  of  higher  risk  of  death  or  recurrent  ischemia.  Serial  perfor-
mance  of  ECGs  (every  30–60  min)  is  recommended  in  the  ED 
evaluation of suspected ACS. In addition, an ECG with right-sided 
lead  placement  should  be  considered  in  patients  with  clinically 
suspected  ischemia  and  a  nondiagnostic  standard  12-lead  ECG. 
Despite the value of the resting ECG, its sensitivity for ischemia is 
poor—as low as 20% in some studies.

Abnormalities  of  the  ST  segment  and  T  wave  may  occur  in  a 
variety of conditions, including pulmonary embolism, ventricular 
hypertrophy,  acute  and  chronic  pericarditis,  myocarditis,  electro-
lyte imbalance, and metabolic disorders. Notably, hyperventilation 
associated with panic disorder can also lead to nonspecific ST and 
T-wave abnormalities. Pulmonary embolism is most often associ-
ated with sinus tachycardia but can also lead to rightward shift of 
the  ECG  axis,  manifesting  as  an  S-wave  in  lead  I,  with  a  Q-wave

and  T-wave  in  lead  III  (Chaps.  240  and  279).  In  patients  with 
ST-segment elevation, the presence of diffuse lead involvement not 
corresponding  to  a  specific  coronary  anatomic  distribution  and 
PR-segment depression can aid in distinguishing pericarditis from 
acute MI. 

CHEST RADIOGRAPHY
(See  Chap.  A12)  Plain  radiography  of  the  chest  is  performed 
routinely  when  patients  present  with  acute  chest  discomfort  and 
selectively when individuals who are being evaluated as outpatients 
have subacute or chronic pain. The chest radiograph is most useful 
for identifying pulmonary processes, such as pneumonia or pneu-
mothorax. Findings are often unremarkable in patients with ACS, 
but  pulmonary  edema  may  be  evident.  Other  specific  findings 
include widening of the mediastinum in some patients with aortic 
dissection, Hampton’s hump or Westermark’s sign in patients with 
pulmonary embolism (Chaps. 279 and A12), or pericardial calcifi-
cation in chronic pericarditis. 

CARDIAC BIOMARKERS
Laboratory testing in patients with acute chest pain is focused on 
the detection of myocardial injury. Such injury can be detected by 
the  presence  of  circulating  proteins  released  from  damaged  car-
diomyocytes.  Owing  to  the  time  necessary  for  this  release,  initial 
biomarkers of injury may be in the normal range, even in patients 
with  STEMI.  Cardiac  troponin  is  the  preferred  biomarker  for  the 
diagnosis of MI and should be measured in all patients with sus-
pected  ACS.  It  is  not  necessary  or  advisable  to  measure  troponin 
in patients without suspicion of ACS unless this test is being used 
specifically for risk stratification (e.g., in pulmonary embolism or 
heart failure).

The  development  of  cardiac  troponin  assays  with  progressively 
greater analytical sensitivity has facilitated detection of substantially 
lower blood concentrations of troponin than was previously possi-
ble.  This  evolution  permits  earlier  detection  of  myocardial  injury 
and more reliable discrimination of changing values, enhances the 
overall accuracy of a diagnosis of MI, and improves risk stratifica-
tion  in  suspected  ACS.  For  these  reasons,  high-sensitivity  assays 
are generally preferred over prior generation troponin assays. The 
greater negative predictive value of a negative troponin result with 
high-sensitivity  assays  is  an  advantage  in  the  evaluation  of  chest 
pain  in  the  ED.  Rapid  rule-out  protocols  that  use  serial  testing 
and  changes  in  troponin  concentration  over  as  short  a  period  as 
1–2  h  appear  to  perform  well  for  diagnosis  of  ACS  when  using  a 
high-sensitivity  troponin  assay.  Troponin  should  be  measured  at 
presentation and repeated at 1–3 h using high-sensitivity troponin 
and 3–6 h using conventional troponin assays. Additional troponin 
measurements  may  be  warranted  beyond  3–6  h  when  the  clinical 
condition still suggests possible ACS or if there is diagnostic uncer-
tainty. In patients presenting more than 2–3 h after symptom onset, 
a concentration of cardiac troponin, at the time of hospital presenta-
tion, below the limit of detection using a high-sensitivity assay may 
be sufficient to exclude MI with a negative predictive value >99%.

With the use of high-sensitivity assays for troponin, myocardial 
injury is detected in a larger proportion of patients who have non- 
ACS cardiopulmonary conditions than with previous, less sensitive 
assays. Therefore, other aspects of the clinical evaluation are crit-
ical  to  the  practitioner’s  determination  of  the  probability  that  the 
symptoms represent ACS. In addition, observation of a change in 
cardiac troponin concentration between serial samples is necessary 
for discriminating acute causes of myocardial injury from chronic 
elevation due to underlying structural heart disease, end-stage renal 
disease, or the rare presence of interfering antibodies. The diagno-
sis of MI is reserved for acute myocardial injury that is marked by 
a  rising  and/or  falling  pattern—with  at  least  one  value  exceeding 
the 99th percentile reference limit—and that is caused by ischemia. 
Other nonischemic insults, such as myocarditis, may result in acute 
myocardial injury but should not be labeled MI (Fig. 14-3).

Other  laboratory  assessments  may  include  the  D-dimer  test  to 
aid  in  exclusion  of  pulmonary  embolism  (Chap.  279).  Measure-
ment of a B-type natriuretic peptide is useful when considered in 
conjunction with the clinical history and exam for the diagnosis of 
heart  failure.  B-type  natriuretic  peptides  also  provide  prognostic 
information among patients with ACS and those with pulmonary 
embolism. 
INTEGRATIVE DECISION-AIDS
Multiple clinical algorithms have been developed to aid in decision-
making during the evaluation and disposition of patients with acute 
nontraumatic chest pain. Such decision-aids estimate either of two 
closely related but not identical probabilities: (1) the probability of 
a  final  diagnosis  of  ACS  and  (2)  the  probability  of  major  cardiac 
events  during  short-term  follow-up.  Such  decision-aids  are  used 
most commonly to identify patients with a low clinical probability 
of  ACS  who  are  candidates  for  discharge  from  the  ED,  with  or 
without  additional  noninvasive  testing.  Goldman  and  Lee  devel-
oped one of the first such decision-aids, using only the ECG and 
risk  indicators—hypotension,  pulmonary  rales,  and  known  ische-
mic  heart  disease—to  categorize  patients  into  four  risk  categories 
ranging from a <1% to a >16% probability of a major cardiovascu-
lar  complication.  Decision-aids  used  more  commonly  in  current 
practice are shown in Fig. 14-4. Elements common across multiple 
risk stratification tools are (1) symptoms typical for ACS; (2) older 
age; (3) risk factors for or known atherosclerosis; (4) ischemic ECG 
abnormalities;  and  (5)  elevated  cardiac  troponin  level.  Although, 
because of very low specificity, the overall diagnostic performance 
of  such  decision-aids  is  poor  (area  under  the  receiver  operating 
curve,  0.55–0.65),  in  conjunction  with  the  ECG  and  serial  high- 
sensitivity  cardiac  troponin,  they  can  help  identify  patients  with 
a  very  low  probability  of  ACS  (e.g.,  <1%)  or  adverse  cardiovas-
cular  events  (<2%  at  30  days).  Clinical  application  of  such  inte-
grated decision-aids or “accelerated diagnostic protocols” has been 
reported to achieve overall “miss rates” for ACS of <0.5% and may 
be useful for identifying patients who may be discharged without 
the need for additional cardiac testing.

Clinicians should differentiate between the algorithms discussed 
above and risk scores derived for stratification of prognosis (e.g., the 
TIMI and GRACE risk scores, Chap. 275) in patients who already 
have an established diagnosis of ACS. The latter risk scores were not 
designed to be used for diagnostic assessment. 
CORONARY AND MYOCARDIAL STRESS IMAGING
Among  patients  for  whom  other  life-threatening  causes  of  chest 
pain  have  been  reasonably  excluded  and  serial  biomarker  and 
clinical assessment have determined the patient to remain eligible 
for  further  testing  because  of  intermediate  or  undetermined  risk, 
diagnostic coronary imaging with coronary computed tomographic 
(CT) angiography or functional testing, preferably with nuclear or 
echocardiographic  imaging,  is  recommended.  Patient  characteris-
tics  (e.g.,  body  habitus  and  renal  function),  prior  cardiac  testing,

history  of  known  coronary  artery  disease,  existing  contraindica-
tions for a given test modality, and patient preferences are consid-
erations when choosing among these diagnostic tests (Chaps. 241 
and A9). 
CT Angiography (See Chap. 241)  CT angiography has emerged as 
a preferred modality for the evaluation of patients with acute chest 
discomfort who are candidates for further testing after biomarker 
and  clinical  risk  assessment.  Coronary  CT  angiography  is  a  sen-
sitive technique for detection of obstructive coronary disease. CT 
appears  to  enhance  the  speed  to  disposition  of  patients  with  a 
low-intermediate probability for ACS, with its major strength being 
the negative predictive value of a finding of no significant stenosis 
or coronary plaque. In addition, contrast-enhanced CT can detect 
focal  areas  of  myocardial  injury  in  the  acute  setting.  At  the  same 
time,  CT  angiography  can  exclude  aortic  dissection,  pericardial 
effusion, and pulmonary embolism. 
Stress  Nuclear  Perfusion  Imaging  or  Stress  Echocardiography 
(See  Chaps.  241  and  A9)  Functional  testing  with  stress  nuclear 
perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography are alternatives for 
the evaluation of patients with acute chest pain who are candidates 
for further testing and are preferred over coronary CT angiography 
in patients with known obstructive epicardial disease. The selection 
of  stress  test  modality  may  depend  on  institutional  availability 
and expertise. Stress testing with myocardial imaging, either with 
nuclear  perfusion  imaging  or  echocardiography,  offers  superior 
diagnostic performance over exercise ECG. In patients selected for 
stress myocardial imaging who are able to exercise, exercise stress 
is  preferred  over  pharmacologic  testing.  When  available,  positron 
emission  tomography  offers  advantages  of  improved  diagnostic 

performance  and  fewer  nondiagnostic  studies  than  single-photon 
emission CT.

Although  functional  testing  is  generally  contraindicated  in 
patients with ongoing chest pain, in selected patients with persistent 
pain and nondiagnostic ECG and biomarker data, resting myocar-
dial perfusion images can be obtained; the absence of any perfusion 
abnormality substantially reduces the likelihood of coronary artery 
disease. In such a strategy, used in some centers, those with abnormal 
rest  perfusion  imaging,  which  cannot  discriminate  between  old  or 
new myocardial defects, usually must undergo additional evaluation. 

EXERCISE ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY
Exercise  electrocardiography  has  historically  been  commonly 
employed for completion of risk stratification of patients who have 
undergone  an  initial  evaluation  that  has  not  revealed  a  specific 
cause  of  chest  discomfort  and  has  identified  a  low  risk  of  ACS. 
Early exercise testing is safe in patients without ongoing chest pain 
or  high-risk  findings  and  may  assist  in  refining  their  prognostic 
assessment. However, for patients with chest pain for whom both 
cardiac troponin and clinical risk stratification have determined the 
patient to have low probability of ACS, there is insufficient evidence 
that  stress  testing  or  cardiac  imaging  improves  their  outcomes. 
This evolution in evidence supports a change from past practice in 
which outpatient stress testing within 72 hours was broadly used for 
patients with acute chest pain. 

OTHER NONINVASIVE STUDIES
Other noninvasive imaging studies of the chest can be used selec-
tively to provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information 
on patients with chest discomfort.

108

Echocardiography  Echocardiography (nonstress) is not necessar-
ily routine in patients with chest discomfort. However, in patients 
with an uncertain diagnosis, particularly those with nondiagnostic 
ST  elevation,  ongoing  symptoms,  or  hemodynamic  instability, 
detection  of  abnormal  regional  wall  motion  provides  evidence  of 
possible  ischemic  dysfunction.  Echocardiography  is  diagnostic  in 
patients  with  mechanical  complications  of  MI  or  in  patients  with 
pericardial  tamponade.  Transthoracic  echocardiography  is  poorly 
sensitive for aortic dissection, although an intimal flap may some-
times be detected in the ascending aorta. 
MRI (See Chap. 241)  Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging 
is  an  evolving,  versatile  technique  for  structural  and  functional 
evaluation of the heart and the vasculature of the chest. CMR can be 
performed as a modality for pharmacologic stress perfusion imag-
ing. Gadolinium-enhanced CMR can provide early detection of MI, 
defining areas of myocardial necrosis accurately, and can delineate 
patterns of myocardial disease that are often useful in discriminating 
ischemic  from  nonischemic  myocardial  injury.  Although  usually 
not  practical  for  the  urgent  evaluation  of  acute  chest  discomfort, 
CMR can be a useful modality for cardiac structural evaluation of 
patients with elevated cardiac troponin levels in the absence of def-
inite coronary artery disease. CMR coronary angiography is in its 
early stages. MRI also permits highly accurate assessment for aortic 
dissection but is infrequently used as the first test because CT and 
transesophageal echocardiography are usually more practical.

 ■ CRITICAL PATHWAYS FOR ACUTE CHEST 
DISCOMFORT
Because of the challenges inherent in reliably identifying the small pro-
portion of patients with serious causes of acute chest discomfort while 
not  exposing  the  larger  number  of  low-risk  patients  to  unnecessary 
testing and extended ED or hospital evaluations, many medical centers 
have adopted critical pathways to expedite the assessment and manage-
ment of patients with nontraumatic chest pain, often in dedicated chest 
pain units. Such pathways are generally aimed at (1) rapid identifica-
tion,  triage,  and  treatment  of  high-risk  cardiopulmonary  conditions 
(e.g., STEMI); (2) accurate identification of low-risk patients who can 
be  safely  observed  in  units  with  less  intensive  monitoring,  undergo 
early  noninvasive  testing,  or  be  discharged  home;  and  (3)  through 
more  efficient  and  systematic  accelerated  diagnostic  protocols,  safe 
reduction in costs associated with overuse of testing and unnecessary 
hospitalizations. In some studies, provision of protocol-driven care in 
chest  pain  units  has  decreased  costs  and  overall  duration  of  hospital 
evaluation with no detectable excess of adverse clinical outcomes.

 ■ OUTPATIENT EVALUATION OF CHEST 
DISCOMFORT
Chest  pain  is  common  in  outpatient  practice,  with  a  lifetime  preva-
lence of 20–40% in the general population. More than 25% of patients 
with MI have had a related visit with a primary care physician in the 
previous month. The diagnostic principles are the same as in the ED. 
However, the pretest probability of an acute cardiopulmonary cause is 
significantly lower. Therefore, testing paradigms are less intense, with 
an emphasis on the history, physical examination, and ECG. Moreover, 
decision-aids developed for settings with a high prevalence of signifi-
cant  cardiopulmonary  disease  have  lower  positive  predictive  value 
when  applied  in  the  practitioner’s  office.  However,  in  general,  if  the 
level of clinical suspicion of ACS is sufficiently high to consider tro-
ponin testing, the patient should be referred to the ED for evaluation.

15 Abdominal Pain

Danny O. Jacobs

Correctly diagnosing acute abdominal pain can be quite challenging. 
Few  clinical  situations  require  greater  judgment,  because  the  most 
catastrophic of events may be forecast by the subtlest of symptoms and 
signs. In every instance, the clinician must distinguish those conditions 
that require urgent intervention from those that do not and can best 
be managed nonoperatively. A meticulously executed, detailed history 
and physical examination are critically important for focusing the dif-
ferential diagnosis and allowing the diagnostic evaluation to proceed 
expeditiously (Table 15-1).

The  etiologic  classification  in  Table  15-2,  although  not  complete, 
provides  a  useful  framework  for  evaluating  patients  with  abdominal 
pain.

Any patient with abdominal pain of recent onset requires an early 
and thorough evaluation. The most common causes of abdominal pain 
on admission are nonspecific abdominal pain, acute appendicitis, pain 
of urologic origin, and intestinal obstruction. A diagnosis of “acute or 
surgical  abdomen”  is  not  acceptable  because  of  its  often  misleading 
and  erroneous  connotations.  Most  patients  who  present  with  acute 
abdominal  pain  will  have  self-limited  disease  processes.  However, 
it  is  important  to  remember  that  pain  severity  does  not  necessarily 
correlate with the severity of the underlying condition. And, the pres-
ence or absence of various degrees of “hunger” is unreliable as a sole 
indicator of the severity of intraabdominal disease. The most obvious 
of “acute abdomens” may not require operative intervention, and the 
mildest of abdominal pains may herald an urgently correctable disease.
 ■ SOME MECHANISMS OF PAIN ORIGINATING IN 
THE ABDOMEN
Inflammation of the Parietal Peritoneum  The  pain  of  parie-
tal  peritoneal  inflammation  is  steady  and  aching  in  character  and  is 
located directly over the inflamed area, its exact reference being pos-
sible because it is transmitted by somatic nerves supplying the parietal 
peritoneum.  The  intensity  of  the  pain  is  dependent  on  the  type  and 
amount of material to which the peritoneal surfaces are exposed in a 
given time period. For example, the sudden release of a small quantity

of  sterile  acidic  gastric  juice  into  the  peritoneal  cavity  causes  much 
more pain than the same amount of grossly contaminated neutral feces. 
Enzymatically active pancreatic juice incites more pain and inflamma-
tion  than  does  the  same  amount  of  sterile  bile  containing  no  potent 
enzymes. Blood is normally only a mild irritant, and the response to 
urine  is  also  typically  bland,  so  exposure  of  blood  and  urine  to  the 
peritoneal  cavity  may  go  unnoticed  unless  it  is  sudden  and  massive. 
Bacterial contamination, such as may occur with pelvic inflammatory 
disease  or  perforated  distal  intestine,  causes  low-intensity  pain  until 
multiplication causes significant amounts of inflammatory mediators 
to  be  released.  Patients  with  perforated  upper  gastrointestinal  ulcers 
may  present  entirely  differently  depending  on  how  quickly  gastric 
juices enter the peritoneal cavity and their pH. Thus, the rate at which 
any inflammatory material irritates the peritoneum is important.

The  pain  of  peritoneal  inflammation  is  invariably  accentuated  by 
pressure  or  changes  in  tension  of  the  peritoneum,  whether  produced

by palpation or by movement such as with coughing or sneezing. The 
patient with peritonitis characteristically lies quietly in bed, preferring 
to  avoid  motion,  in  contrast  to  the  patient  with  colic,  who  may  be 
thrashing in discomfort.

Another characteristic feature of peritoneal irritation is tonic reflex 
spasm  of  the  abdominal  musculature,  localized  to  the  involved  body 
segment. Its intensity depends on the integrity of the nervous system, 
the location of the inflammatory process, and the rate at which it devel-
ops. Spasm over a perforated retrocecal appendix or perforation into 
the lesser peritoneal sac may be minimal or absent because of the pro-
tective effect of overlying viscera. Catastrophic abdominal emergencies 
may be associated with minimal or no detectable pain or muscle spasm 
in obtunded, seriously ill, debilitated, immunosuppressed, or psychotic 
patients. A slowly developing process also often greatly attenuates the 
degree of muscle spasm.

Obstruction of Hollow Viscera 
Intraluminal obstruction classi-
cally elicits intermittent or colicky abdominal pain that is not as well 
localized  as  the  pain  of  parietal  peritoneal  irritation.  However,  the 
absence  of  cramping  discomfort  can  be  misleading  because  disten-
tion  of  a  hollow  viscus  may  also  produce  steady  pain  with  only  rare 
paroxysms.

Small-bowel  obstruction  often  presents  as  poorly  localized,  inter-
mittent periumbilical or supraumbilical pain. As the intestine progres-
sively  dilates  and  loses  muscular  tone,  the  colicky  nature  of  the  pain 
may  diminish.  With  superimposed  strangulating  obstruction,  pain 
may spread to the lower lumbar region if there is traction on the root 
of the mesentery. The colicky pain of colonic obstruction is of lesser 
intensity,  is  commonly  located  in  the  infraumbilical  area,  and  may 
often radiate to the lumbar region.

Sudden distention of the biliary tree produces a steady rather than 
colicky type of pain; hence, the term biliary colic is misleading. Acute 
distention  of  the  gallbladder  typically  causes  pain  in  the  right  upper 
quadrant with radiation to the right posterior region of the thorax or 
to the tip of the right scapula, but discomfort is also not uncommonly 
found  near  the  midline.  Distention  of  the  common  bile  duct  often 
causes  epigastric  pain  that  may  radiate  to  the  upper  lumbar  region. 
Considerable  variation  is  common,  however,  so  that  differentiation 
between gallbladder or common ductal disease may be impossible.

Gradual dilatation of the biliary tree, as can occur with carcinoma of 
the head of the pancreas, may cause no pain or only a mild aching sen-
sation in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant. The pain of disten-
tion of the pancreatic ducts is similar to that described for distention of 
the common bile duct but, in addition, is very frequently accentuated 
by recumbency and relieved by the upright position.

Obstruction of the urinary bladder usually causes dull, low-intensity 
pain in the suprapubic region. Restlessness, without specific complaint 
of  pain,  may  be  the  only  sign  of  a  distended  bladder  in  an  obtunded 
patient. In contrast, acute obstruction of the intravesicular portion of the 
ureter is characterized by severe suprapubic and flank pain that radiates 
to the penis, scrotum, or inner aspect of the upper thigh. Obstruction 
of the ureteropelvic junction manifests as pain near the costovertebral 
angle, whereas obstruction of the remainder of the ureter is associated 
with flank pain that often extends into the same side of the abdomen.

Vascular Disturbances  A frequent misconception is that pain due 
to intraabdominal vascular disturbances is sudden and catastrophic in 
nature. Certain disease processes, such as embolism or thrombosis of 
the superior mesenteric artery or impending rupture of an abdominal 
aortic aneurysm, can certainly be associated with diffuse, severe pain. 
Yet, just as frequently, the patient with occlusion of the superior mesen-
teric artery only has mild continuous or cramping diffuse pain for 2 or 
3 days before vascular collapse or findings of peritoneal inflammation 
appear.  The  early,  seemingly  insignificant  discomfort  is  caused  by 
hyperperistalsis rather than peritoneal inflammation. Indeed, absence 
of tenderness and rigidity in the presence of continuous, diffuse pain 
(e.g., “pain out of proportion to physical findings”) in a patient likely to 
have vascular disease is quite characteristic of occlusion of the superior 
mesenteric artery. Abdominal pain with radiation to the sacral region,

flank, or genitalia should always signal the possible presence of a rup-
turing abdominal aortic aneurysm. This pain may persist over a period 
of several days before rupture and collapse occur.

Abdominal Wall  Pain arising from the abdominal wall is usually 
constant  and  aching.  Movement,  prolonged  standing,  and  pressure 
accentuate  the  discomfort  and  associated  muscle  spasm.  In  the  rela-
tively rare case of hematoma of the rectus sheath, now most frequently 
encountered in association with anticoagulant therapy, a mass may be 
present in the lower quadrants of the abdomen. Simultaneous involve-
ment of muscles in other parts of the body usually serves to differen-
tiate myositis of the abdominal wall from other processes that might 
cause pain in the same region.

 ■ REFERRED PAIN IN ABDOMINAL DISEASE
Pain referred to the abdomen from the thorax, spine, or genitalia may 
present a diagnostic challenge because diseases of the upper part of the 
abdominal  cavity  such  as  acute  cholecystitis  or  perforated  ulcer  may 
be associated with intrathoracic complications. A most important, yet 
often forgotten, dictum is that the possibility of intrathoracic disease 
must be considered in every patient with abdominal pain, especially if 
the pain is in the upper abdomen.

Systematic  questioning  and  examination  directed  toward  detect-
ing  myocardial  or  pulmonary  infarction,  pneumonia,  pericarditis,  or 
esophageal  disease  (the  intrathoracic  diseases  that  most  often  mas-
querade as abdominal emergencies) will often provide sufficient clues 
to  establish  the  proper  diagnosis.  Diaphragmatic  pleuritis  resulting 
from pneumonia or pulmonary infarction may cause pain in the right 
upper quadrant and pain in the supraclavicular area, the latter radia-
tion to be distinguished from the referred subscapular pain caused by 
acute distention of the extrahepatic biliary tree. The ultimate decision 
as to the origin of abdominal pain may require deliberate and planned 
observation  over  a  period  of  several  hours,  during  which  repeated 
questioning and examination will provide the diagnosis or suggest the 
appropriate studies.

Referred pain of thoracic origin is often accompanied by splinting 
of  the  involved  hemithorax  with  respiratory  lag  and  a  decrease  in 
excursion more marked than that seen in the presence of intraabdom-
inal disease. In addition, apparent abdominal muscle spasm caused by 
referred pain will diminish during the inspiratory phase of respiration, 
whereas it persists throughout both respiratory phases if it is of abdom-
inal origin. Palpation over the area of referred pain in the abdomen also 
does not usually accentuate the pain and, in many instances, actually 
seems to relieve it.

Thoracic disease and abdominal disease frequently coexist and may 
be difficult or impossible to differentiate. For example, the patient with 
known biliary tract disease often has epigastric pain during myocardial 
infarction,  or  biliary  colic  may  be  referred  to  the  precordium  or  left 
shoulder in a patient who has suffered previously from angina pectoris. 
For an explanation of the radiation of pain to a previously diseased 
area, see Chap. 13.

Referred pain from the spine, which usually involves compression 
or  irritation  of  nerve  roots,  is  characteristically  intensified  by  cer-
tain  motions  such  as  cough,  sneeze,  or  strain  and  is  associated  with 
hyperesthesia over the involved dermatomes. Pain referred to the abdo-
men from the testes or seminal vesicles is generally accentuated by the 
slightest pressure on either of these organs. The abdominal discomfort 
experienced is of dull, aching character and is poorly localized.

 ■ METABOLIC ABDOMINAL CRISES
Pain  of  metabolic  origin  may  simulate  almost  any  other  type  of 
intraabdominal disease. Several mechanisms may be at work. In cer-
tain instances, such as hyperlipidemia, the metabolic disease itself may 
be  accompanied  by  an  intraabdominal  process  such  as  pancreatitis, 
which  can  lead  to  unnecessary  laparotomy  unless  recognized.  C1 
esterase deficiency associated with angioneurotic edema is often asso-
ciated with episodes of severe abdominal pain. Whenever the cause of 

abdominal pain is obscure, a metabolic origin always must be consid-
ered.  Abdominal  pain  is  also  the  hallmark  of  familial  Mediterranean 
fever (Chap. 369).

The  pain  of  porphyria  and  of  lead  colic  is  usually  difficult  to  dis-
tinguish from that of intestinal obstruction, because severe hyperperi-
stalsis is a prominent feature of both. The pain of uremia or diabetes 
is nonspecific, and the pain and tenderness frequently shift in location 
and intensity. Diabetic acidosis may be precipitated by acute appendi-
citis or intestinal obstruction, so if prompt resolution of the abdominal 
pain does not result from correction of the metabolic abnormalities, an 
underlying organic problem should be suspected. Black widow spider 
bites produce intense pain and rigidity of the abdominal muscles and 
back, an area infrequently involved in intraabdominal disease.

 ■ IMMUNOCOMPROMISE
Evaluating and diagnosing causes of abdominal pain in immunosup-
pressed  or  otherwise  immunocompromised  patients  is  very  difficult. 
This includes those who have undergone organ transplantation; who 
are  receiving  immunosuppressive  treatments  for  autoimmune  dis-
eases,  chemotherapy,  or  glucocorticoids;  who  have  AIDS;  and  who 
are  very  old.  In  these  circumstances,  normal  physiologic  responses 
may be absent or masked. In addition, unusual infections may cause 
abdominal  pain  where  the  etiologic  agents  include  cytomegalovirus, 
mycobacteria,  protozoa,  and  fungi.  These  pathogens  may  affect  all 
gastrointestinal organs, including the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas, 
as  well  as  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  causing  occult  or  overtly  symp-
tomatic perforations of the latter. Splenic abscesses due to Candida or 
Salmonella infection should also be considered, especially when eval-
uating patients with left upper quadrant or left flank pain. Acalculous 
cholecystitis  may  be  observed  in  immunocompromised  patients  or 
those with AIDS, where it is often associated with cryptosporidiosis or 
cytomegalovirus infection.

Neutropenic  enterocolitis  (typhlitis)  is  often  identified  as  a  cause 
of abdominal pain and fever in some patients with bone marrow sup-
pression due to chemotherapy. Acute graft-versus-host disease should 
be  considered  in  this  circumstance.  Optimal  management  of  these 
patients  requires  meticulous  follow-up  including  serial  examinations 
to  assess  the  need  for  more  surgical  intervention,  for  example,  to 
address perforation.

 ■ NEUROGENIC CAUSES
Diseases  that  injure  sensory  nerves  may  cause  causalgic  pain.  This 
pain has a burning character and is usually limited to the distribution 
of a given peripheral nerve. Stimuli that are normally not painful such 
as  touch  or  a  change  in  temperature  may  be  causalgic  and  are  often 
present even at rest. The demonstration of irregularly spaced cutaneous 
“pain spots” may be the only indication that an old nerve injury exists. 
Even though the pain may be precipitated by gentle palpation, rigidity 
of the abdominal muscles is absent, and the respirations are not usually 
disturbed. Distention of the abdomen is uncommon, and the pain has 
no relationship to food intake.

Pain arising from spinal nerves or roots comes and goes suddenly 
and  is  of  a  lancinating  type  (Chap.  17).  It  may  be  caused  by  herpes 
zoster, impingement by arthritis, tumors, a herniated nucleus pulposus, 
diabetes, or syphilis. It is not associated with food intake, abdominal 
distention, or changes in respiration. Severe muscle spasms, when pres-
ent, may be relieved by, but are certainly not accentuated by, abdominal 
palpation.  The  pain  is  made  worse  by  movement  of  the  spine  and  is 
usually confined to a few dermatomes. Hyperesthesia is very common.
Pain  due  to  functional  causes  conforms  to  none  of  the  aforemen-
tioned  patterns.  Mechanisms  of  disease  are  not  clearly  established. 
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder 
characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. The diag-
nosis  is  made  on  the  basis  of  clinical  criteria  (Chap.  327)  and  after 
exclusion  of  demonstrable  structural  abnormalities.  The  episodes  of 
abdominal pain may be brought on by stress, and the pain varies con-
siderably in type and location. Nausea and vomiting are rare. Localized

IBS or related functional disorders are not yet fully understood.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Abdominal Pain

Few abdominal conditions require such urgent operative interven-
tion  that  an  orderly  approach  needs  to  be  abandoned,  no  matter 
how  ill  the  patient  is.  Only  patients  with  exsanguinating  intraab-
dominal  hemorrhage  (e.g.,  ruptured  aneurysm)  must  be  rushed 
to  the  operating  room  immediately,  but  in  such  instances,  only  a 
few minutes are required to assess the critical nature of the prob-
lem. Under these circumstances, all obstacles must be swept aside, 
adequate  venous  access  for  fluid  replacement  obtained,  and  the 
operation begun. Unfortunately, many of these patients may die in 
the  radiology  department  or  the  emergency  room  while  awaiting 
unnecessary examinations. There are no absolute contraindications 
to  operation  when  massive  intraabdominal  hemorrhage  is  present. 
Fortunately,  this  situation  is  relatively  rare.  This  statement  does 
not necessarily apply to patients with intraluminal gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage,  who  can  often  be  managed  by  other  means  (Chap. 
48).  In  these  patients,  obtaining  a  detailed  history  when  possible 
can be extremely helpful even though it can be laborious and time-
consuming. Decision-making regarding next steps is facilitated and 
a  reasonably  accurate  diagnosis  can  be  made  before  any  further 
diagnostic testing is undertaken.

In  cases  of  acute  abdominal  pain,  a  diagnosis  can  be  readily 
established in most instances, whereas success is not so frequent in 
patients with chronic pain. IBS is one of the most common causes of 
abdominal pain and must always be kept in mind (Chap. 327). The 
location of the pain can assist in narrowing the differential diagno-
sis (Table 15-3); however, the chronological sequence of events in the

patient’s  history  is  often  more  important  than  the  pain’s  location. 
Careful  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  extraabdominal  regions. 
Narcotics  or  analgesics  should  not  be  withheld  until  a  definitive 
diagnosis or a definitive plan has been formulated; obfuscation of 
the diagnosis by adequate analgesia is unlikely.

An accurate menstrual history in a female patient is essential. It 
is important to remember that normal anatomic relationships can 
be significantly altered by the gravid uterus. Abdominal and pelvic 
pain  may  occur  during  pregnancy  due  to  conditions  that  do  not 
require  operation.  Lastly,  some  otherwise  noteworthy  laboratory 
values  (e.g.,  leukocytosis)  may  represent  the  normal  physiologic 
changes of pregnancy.

In  the  examination,  simple  critical  inspection  of  the  patient, 
for  example,  of  facies,  position  in  bed,  and  respiratory  activity, 
provides valuable clues. The amount of information to be gleaned 
is directly proportional to the gentleness and thoroughness of the 
examiner. Once a patient with peritoneal inflammation has been 
examined  brusquely,  accurate  assessment  by  the  next  examiner 
becomes almost impossible. Eliciting rebound tenderness by sud-
den release of a deeply palpating hand in a patient with suspected 
peritonitis  is  cruel  and  unnecessary.  The  same  information  can 
be  obtained  by  gentle  percussion  of  the  abdomen  (rebound  ten-
derness  on  a  miniature  scale),  a  maneuver  that  can  be  far  more 
precise and localizing. Asking the patient to cough will elicit true 
rebound  tenderness  without  the  need  for  placing  a  hand  on  the 
abdomen.  Furthermore,  the  forceful  demonstration  of  rebound 
tenderness will startle and induce protective spasm in a nervous or 
worried patient in whom true rebound tenderness is not present. A 
palpable gallbladder will be missed if palpation is so aggressive that 
voluntary  muscle  spasm  becomes  superimposed  on  involuntary 
muscular rigidity.

As  with  history  taking,  sufficient  time  should  be  spent  in  the 
examination. Abdominal signs may be minimal but, nevertheless, 
if  accompanied  by  consistent  symptoms,  may  be  exceptionally 
meaningful. Abdominal signs may be virtually or totally absent in 
cases of pelvic peritonitis, so careful pelvic and rectal examinations 
are  mandatory  in  every  patient  with  abdominal  pain.  Tenderness 
on pelvic or rectal examination in the absence of other abdominal 
signs  can  be  caused  by  operative  indications  such  as  perforated 
appendicitis, diverticulitis, twisted ovarian cyst, and many others. 
Much  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  presence  or  absence  of  per-
istaltic  sounds,  their  quality,  and  their  frequency.  Auscultation  of 
the  abdomen  is  one  of  the  least  revealing  aspects  of  the  physical 
examination of a patient with abdominal pain. Catastrophes such 
as a strangulating small-intestinal obstruction or perforated appen-
dicitis may occur in the presence of normal peristaltic sounds. Con-
versely, when the proximal part of the intestine above obstruction 
becomes  markedly  distended  and  edematous,  peristaltic  sounds 
may  lose  the  characteristics  of  borborygmi  and  become  weak  or 
absent, even when peritonitis is not present. It is usually the severe 
chemical peritonitis of sudden onset that is associated with the truly 
silent abdomen.

Laboratory examinations may be valuable in assessing the patient 
with abdominal pain, yet, with few exceptions, they rarely establish 
a diagnosis. Leukocytosis should never be the single deciding fac-
tor as to whether or not operation is indicated. A white blood cell 
count >20,000/μL may be observed with perforation of a viscus, but 
pancreatitis,  acute  cholecystitis,  pelvic  inflammatory  disease,  and 
intestinal infarction may also be associated with marked leukocy-
tosis. A normal white blood cell count is not rare in cases of per-
foration of abdominal viscera. A diagnosis of anemia may be more 
helpful than the white blood cell count, especially when combined 
with the history.

The urinalysis may reveal the state of hydration or rule out severe 
renal  disease,  diabetes,  or  urinary  infection.  Blood  urea  nitrogen, 
glucose, and serum bilirubin levels and liver function tests may be 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   111

helpful. Serum amylase levels may be increased by many diseases 
other than pancreatitis, for example, perforated ulcer, strangulating 
intestinal  obstruction,  and  acute  cholecystitis;  thus,  elevations  of 
serum amylase do not rule in or rule out the need for an operation.
Plain and upright or lateral decubitus radiographs of the abdo-
men have limited utility and may be unnecessary in some patients 
who  have  substantial  evidence  of  some  diseases  such  as  acute 
appendicitis or strangulated external hernia. Where the indications 
for  surgical  or  medical  intervention  are  not  clear,  low-dose  com-
puted  tomography  is  preferred  to  abdominal  radiography  when 
evaluating nontraumatic acute abdominal pain.

Very rarely, barium or water-soluble contrast study of the upper 
part  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  is  an  appropriate  radiographic 
investigation  and  may  demonstrate  partial  intestinal  obstruction 
that may elude diagnosis by other means. If there is any question 
of  obstruction  of  the  colon,  oral  administration  of  barium  sul-
fate  should  be  avoided.  On  the  other  hand,  in  cases  of  suspected 
colonic  obstruction  (without  perforation),  a  contrast  enema  may 
be diagnostic.

In the absence of trauma, peritoneal lavage has been replaced as 
a  diagnostic  tool  by  CT  scanning  and  laparoscopy.  Ultrasonogra-
phy has proved to be useful in detecting an enlarged gallbladder or 
pancreas, the presence of gallstones, an enlarged ovary, or a tubal 
pregnancy.  Laparoscopy  is  especially  helpful  in  diagnosing  pelvic 
conditions,  such  as  ovarian  cysts,  tubal  pregnancies,  salpingitis, 
acute appendicitis, and other disease processes. Laparoscopy has a 
particular advantage over imaging in that the underlying etiologic 
condition can often be definitively addressed.

Radioisotopic  hepatobiliary  iminodiacetic  acid  scans  (HIDAs) 
may  help  differentiate  acute  cholecystitis  or  biliary  colic  from 
acute  pancreatitis.  A  CT  scan  may  demonstrate  an  enlarged  pan-
creas,  ruptured  spleen,  or  thickened  colonic  or  appendiceal  wall 
and streaking of the mesocolon or mesoappendix characteristic of 
diverticulitis or appendicitis.

Sometimes, even under the best circumstances with all available 
aids  and  with  the  greatest  of  clinical  skill,  a  definitive  diagnosis 
cannot be established at the time of the initial examination. And, in 
some cases, operation may be indicated based on clinical grounds 
alone. Should that decision be questionable, watchful waiting with 
repeated questioning and examination will often elucidate the true 
nature of the illness and indicate the proper course of action.

16 Headache

Peter J. Goadsby

Headache is among the most common reasons patients seek medical 
attention and is responsible, on a global basis, for more disability than 
any other neurologic problem. Diagnosis and management are based 
on a careful clinical approach augmented by an understanding of the 
anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology of the nervous system path-
ways  mediating  the  various  headache  syndromes.  This  chapter  will 
focus on the general approach to a patient with headache; migraine and 
other primary headache disorders are discussed in Chap. 430.

 ■ GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A  classification  system  developed  by  the  International  Headache 
Society  (www.ihs-headache.org/en/resources/guidelines/)  characterizes 
headache  as  primary  or  secondary  (Table  16-1).  Primary  headaches 
are those in which headache and its associated features are the disorder 
itself, whereas secondary headaches are those caused by exogenous dis-
orders (Headache Classification Committee of the International Head-
ache  Society,  2018).  Primary  headache  often  results  in  considerable 
disability and a decrease in the patient’s quality of life. Mild secondary 
headache, such as that seen in association with upper respiratory tract 
infections, is common but rarely worrisome. Life-threatening headache 
is relatively uncommon, but vigilance is required in order to recognize 
and appropriately treat such patients.

 ■ ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF HEADACHE
Pain  usually  occurs  when  peripheral  nociceptors  are  stimulated  in 
response to tissue injury, visceral distension, or other factors (Chap. 13). 
In  such  situations,  pain  perception  is  a  normal  physiologic  response 
mediated  by  a  healthy  nervous  system.  Pain  can  also  result  when 
pain-producing pathways of the peripheral or central nervous system 
(CNS) are damaged or activated inappropriately. Headache may origi-
nate from either or both mechanisms. Relatively few cranial structures 
are pain producing; these include the scalp, meningeal arteries, dural 
sinuses, falx cerebri, and proximal segments of the large pial arteries. 
The ventricular ependyma, choroid plexus, pial veins, and much of the 
brain parenchyma are not pain producing.

The key structures involved in primary headache are the following:

•	 The  large  intracranial  vessels  and  dura  mater,  and  the  peripheral 
terminals of the trigeminal nerve that innervate these structures
•	 The  caudal  portion  of  the  trigeminal  nucleus,  which  extends  into 
the dorsal horns of the upper cervical spinal cord and receives input

The  trigeminovascular  system  innervates  the  large  intracranial 
vessels  and  dura  mater  via  the  trigeminal  nerve.  Cranial  autonomic 
symptoms,  such  as  lacrimation,  conjunctival  injection,  nasal  con-
gestion,  rhinorrhea,  periorbital  swelling,  aural  fullness,  and  ptosis, 
are  prominent  in  the  trigeminal  autonomic  cephalalgias  (TACs), 
including cluster headache and paroxysmal hemicrania, and may also 
be  seen  in  migraine,  even  in  children.  These  autonomic  symptoms 
reflect activation of cranial parasympathetic pathways, and functional 
imaging studies indicate that vascular changes in migraine and cluster 
headache,  when  present,  are  similarly  driven  by  these  cranial  auto-
nomic  systems.  Thus,  they  are  secondary,  and  not  causative,  events 
in  the  headache  cascade.  Moreover,  they  can  often  be  mistaken  for 
symptoms or signs of cranial sinus inflammation, which is then over-
diagnosed and inappropriately managed. Migraine and other primary 
headache  types  are  not  “vascular  headaches”;  these  disorders  do  not 
reliably manifest vascular changes, and treatment outcomes cannot be 
predicted by vascular effects. Migraine is a brain disorder and is best 
understood and managed as such.
 ■ CLINICAL EVALUATION OF ACUTE,  
NEW-ONSET HEADACHE
The patient who presents with a new, severe headache has a differen-
tial  diagnosis  that  is  quite  different  from  the  patient  with  recurrent 
headaches  over  many  years.  In  new-onset  and  severe  headache,  the 
probability of finding a potentially serious cause is considerably greater 
than in recurrent headache. Patients with recent onset of pain require 
prompt  evaluation  and  appropriate  treatment.  Serious  causes  to  be 
considered include meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural or 
subdural  hematoma,  glaucoma,  tumor,  and  purulent  sinusitis.  When 
worrisome symptoms and signs are present (Table 16-2), rapid diag-
nosis and management are critical.

A  careful  neurologic  examination  is  an  essential  first  step  in  the 
evaluation. In most cases, patients with an abnormal examination or 
a history of recent-onset headache should be evaluated by a computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the 
brain. As an initial screening procedure for intracranial pathology in 
this  setting,  CT  and  MRI  methods  appear  to  be  equally  sensitive.  In 
some  circumstances,  a  lumbar  puncture  (LP)  is  also  required,  unless 
a  benign  etiology  can  be  otherwise  established.  A  general  evaluation 
of acute headache might include cranial arteries by palpation; cervical 
spine by the effect of passive movement of the head and by imaging; 
the investigation of cardiovascular and renal status by blood pressure 
monitoring and urine examination; and eyes by funduscopy, intraocu-
lar pressure measurement, and refraction.

The patient’s psychological state should also be evaluated because a 
relationship exists between head pain, depression, and anxiety. This is 
intended  to  identify  comorbidity  rather  than  provide  an  explanation 
for  the  headache,  because  troublesome  headache  is  seldom  simply 
caused  by  mood  change.  Although  it  is  notable  that  medicines  with 
antidepressant  actions  are  also  effective  in  the  preventive  treatment

of both tension-type headache and migraine, each symptom must be 
treated optimally.

Underlying recurrent headache disorders may be activated by pain 
that  follows  otologic  or  endodontic  surgical  procedures.  Thus,  pain 
about the head as the result of diseased tissue or trauma may reawaken 
an  otherwise  quiescent  migraine  syndrome.  Treatment  of  the  head-
ache  is  largely  ineffective  until  the  cause  of  the  primary  problem  is 
addressed.

Serious underlying conditions that are associated with headache are 
described below. Brain tumor is a rare cause of headache and even less 
commonly a cause of severe pain. The vast majority of patients present-
ing with severe headache have a benign cause.

SECONDARY HEADACHE
The  management  of  secondary  headache  focuses  on  diagnosis  and 
treatment of the underlying condition.
 ■ MENINGITIS
Acute, severe headache with stiff neck and fever suggests meningitis. 
LP is mandatory. Often there is striking accentuation of pain with eye 
movement. Meningitis can be easily mistaken for migraine in that the 
cardinal symptoms of pounding headache, photophobia, nausea, and 
vomiting  are  frequently  present,  perhaps  reflecting  the  underlying 
biology of some of the patients.

Meningitis is discussed in Chaps. 138 and 139.

 ■ INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE
Acute, maximal in <5 min, severe headache lasting >5 min with stiff 
neck but without fever suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage. A ruptured 
aneurysm,  arteriovenous  malformation,  or  intraparenchymal  hemor-
rhage may also present with headache alone. Rarely, if the hemorrhage 
is  small  or  below  the  foramen  magnum,  the  head  CT  scan  can  be 
normal.  Therefore,  LP  may  be  required  to  diagnose  definitively  sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage is discussed in Chap. 429, and intra-

cranial hemorrhage in Chap. 428.
 ■ BRAIN TUMOR
Approximately  30%  of  patients  with  brain  tumors  consider  headache 
to  be  their  chief  complaint.  The  head  pain  is  usually  nondescript—an 
intermittent deep, dull aching of moderate intensity, which may worsen 
with exertion or change in position and may be associated with nausea 
and vomiting. This pattern of symptoms results from migraine far more 
often  than  from  brain  tumor.  The  headache  of  brain  tumor  disturbs 
sleep in about 10% of patients. Vomiting that precedes the appearance 
of  headache  by  weeks  is  highly  characteristic  of  posterior  fossa  brain 
tumors.  A  history  of  amenorrhea  or  galactorrhea  should  lead  one  to 
question whether a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma (or polycystic 
ovary syndrome) is the source of headache. Headache arising de novo in 
a patient with known malignancy suggests either cerebral metastases or 
carcinomatous meningitis. Head pain appearing abruptly after bending, 
lifting, or coughing can be due to a posterior fossa mass, a Chiari mal-
formation, or low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume.

Brain tumors are discussed in Chap. 90.
 ■ TEMPORAL ARTERITIS (SEE ALSO  
CHAPS. 32 AND 363)
Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is an inflammatory disorder of arteries 
that  frequently  involves  the  extracranial  carotid  circulation.  It  is  a 
common disorder of the elderly; its annual incidence is 77 per 100,000 
individuals aged ≥50. The average age of onset is 70 years, and women 
account for 65% of cases. About half of patients with untreated tem-
poral arteritis develop blindness due to involvement of the ophthalmic 
artery and its branches; indeed, the ischemic optic neuropathy induced 
by giant cell arteritis is the major cause of rapidly developing bilateral 
blindness in patients >60 years. Because treatment with glucocorticoids 
is effective in preventing this complication, prompt recognition of the 
disorder is important.

Typical presenting symptoms include headache, polymyalgia rheu-
matica (Chap. 363), jaw claudication, fever, and weight loss. Headache

is the dominant symptom and often appears in association with mal-
aise  and  muscle  aches.  Head  pain  may  be  unilateral  or  bilateral  and 
is  located  temporally  in  50%  of  patients  but  may  involve  any  and  all 
aspects of the cranium. Pain usually appears gradually over a few hours 
before peak intensity is reached; occasionally, it is explosive in onset. 
The  quality  of  pain  is  infrequently  throbbing;  it  is  almost  invariably 
described  as  dull  and  boring,  with  superimposed  episodic  stabbing 
pains similar to the sharp pains that appear in migraine. Most patients 
can recognize that the origin of their head pain is superficial, external 
to the skull, rather than originating deep within the cranium (the pain 
site  usually  identified  by  migraineurs).  Scalp  tenderness  is  present, 
often to a marked degree; brushing the hair or resting the head on a 
pillow may be impossible because of pain. Headache is usually worse 
at night and often aggravated by exposure to cold. Additional findings 
may  include  reddened,  tender  nodules  or  red  streaking  of  the  skin 
overlying the temporal arteries, and tenderness of the temporal or, less 
commonly, the occipital arteries.

The  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  (ESR)  is  often,  although  not 
always, elevated; a normal ESR does not exclude giant cell arteritis. A 
temporal  artery  biopsy  followed  by  immediate  treatment  with  pred-
nisone  80  mg  daily  for  the  first  4–6  weeks  should  be  initiated  when 
clinical suspicion is high; treatment should not be unreasonably delayed 
to obtain a biopsy. The prevalence of migraine among the elderly is sub-
stantial, considerably higher than that of giant cell arteritis. Migraineurs 
often report amelioration of their headache with prednisone; thus, cau-
tion must be used when interpreting the therapeutic response.
 ■ GLAUCOMA
Glaucoma  may  present  with  a  prostrating  headache  associated  with 
nausea and vomiting. The headache often starts with severe eye pain. 
On physical examination, the eye is often red with a fixed, moderately 
dilated pupil.

Glaucoma is discussed in Chap. 32.

PRIMARY HEADACHE DISORDERS
Primary headaches are disorders in which headache and associated fea-
tures occur in the absence of any exogenous cause. The most common 
are  migraine,  tension-type  headache,  and  the  TACs,  notably  cluster 
headache. These entities are discussed in detail in Chap. 430.
 ■ CHRONIC DAILY OR NEAR-DAILY HEADACHE
The  broad  description  of  chronic  daily  headache  (CDH)  can  be 
applied when a patient experiences headache on 15 days or more per 
month. CDH is neither a single entity nor a diagnosis; it encompasses 
a  number  of  different  headache  syndromes,  both  primary  and  sec-
ondary (Table 16-3). In aggregate, this group presents considerable

disability  and  is  thus  specially  mentioned  here.  Population-based 
estimates  suggest  that  about  4%  of  adults  have  daily  or  near-daily 
headache.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Chronic Daily Headache

The first step in the management of patients with CDH is to diag-
nose any secondary headache and treat that problem (Table 16-3). 
This  can  sometimes  be  a  challenge  when  the  underlying  cause 
triggers  worsening  of  a  primary  headache.  For  patients  with  pri-
mary headaches, diagnosis of the headache type will guide therapy. 
Preventive  treatments  such  as  tricyclics,  either  amitriptyline  or   
nortriptyline,  at  doses  up  to  1  mg/kg,  are  very  useful  in  patients 
with  CDH  arising  from  migraine  or  tension-type  headache  or 
where  the  secondary  cause  has  activated  the  underlying  primary 
headache.  Tricyclics  are  started  in  low  doses  (10–25  mg  daily) 
and may be given 12 h before the expected time of awakening in 
order  to  avoid  excessive  morning  sleepiness.  Medicines  including 
topiramate,  valproate,  propranolol,  flunarizine  (not  available  in 
the  United  States),  candesartan,  and  the  newer  calcitonin  gene- 
related peptide (CGRP) pathway monoclonal antibodies, or gepants- 
CGRP  receptor  antagonists  (see  Chap.  430)  are  also  useful  when 
the underlying issue is migraine. 
MANAGEMENT OF MEDICALLY INTRACTABLE DISABLING 
PRIMARY HEADACHE
The  management  of  medically  intractable  headache  is  difficult, 
although recent developments in therapy are at hand. Monoclonal 
antibodies to CGRP or its receptor have been reported to be effec-
tive and well tolerated in chronic migraine and are now licensed for 
use in clinical practice. Noninvasive neuromodulatory approaches, 
such as single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation and nonin-
vasive vagal nerve stimulation, which appear to modulate thalamic 
processing  or  brainstem  mechanisms,  respectively,  in  migraine 
have been used in clinical practice with success. Noninvasive vagal 
nerve  stimulation  has  also  shown  promise  particularly  in  chronic 
cluster  headache,  chronic  paroxysmal  hemicrania,  and  hemicra-
nia  continua,  and  possibly  in  short-lasting  unilateral  neuralgi-
form headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA) 
and  short-lasting  unilateral  neuralgiform  headache  attacks  with 
conjunctival  injection  and  tearing  (SUNCT)  (Chap.  430).  Other 
modalities are discussed in Chap. 430. 

MEDICATION-RELATED AND MEDICATION-OVERUSE HEADACHE
Overuse of analgesic medication for headache can aggravate head-
ache frequency, markedly impair the effect of preventive medicines, 
and induce a state of refractory daily or near-daily headache called 
medication-overuse headache. A proportion of patients who stop tak-
ing analgesics will experience substantial improvement in the sever-
ity and frequency of their headache. However, even after cessation 
of analgesic use, many patients continue to have headache, although 
they may feel clinically improved in some way, especially if they have 
been using opioids or barbiturates regularly. The residual symptoms 
probably represent the underlying primary headache disorder, and 
most commonly this issue occurs in patients prone to migraine. 
Management  of  Medication  Overuse:  Outpatients  For  patients 
who  overuse  analgesic  medications,  it  is  often  helpful  to  reduce 
and eliminate the medications, although this approach is far from 
universally  effective.  One  approach  is  to  reduce  the  medication 
dose  by  10%  every  1–2  weeks.  Immediate  cessation  of  analgesic 
use is possible for some patients, provided there is no contraindi-
cation. Both approaches are facilitated by use of a medication diary 
maintained during the month or two before cessation; this helps to 
identify the scope of the problem. A small dose of a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as naproxen, 500 mg bid, if 
tolerated, will help relieve residual pain as analgesic use is reduced.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases 
 
 
NSAID  overuse  is  not  usually  a  problem  for  patients  with  daily 
headache when an NSAID with a longer half-life is taken once or 
twice daily; however, overuse problems may develop with shorter- 
acting  NSAIDS.  Once  the  patient  has  substantially  reduced  anal-
gesic use, a preventive medication should be introduced. Another 
widely used approach is to commence the preventive at the same 
time the analgesic reduction is started. It must be emphasized that 
preventives may not work in the presence of analgesic overuse, partic-
ularly with opioids. The most common cause of unresponsiveness to 
treatment is the use of a preventive when analgesics continue to be 
used regularly. For some patients, discontinuing analgesics is very 
difficult; often the best approach is to inform the patient that some 
degree of headache is inevitable during this initial period. 
Management  of  Medication  Overuse:  Inpatients  Some  patients 
will  require  hospitalization  for  detoxification.  Such  patients  have 
typically failed efforts at outpatient withdrawal or have a significant 
medical  condition,  such  as  diabetes  mellitus  or  epilepsy,  which 
would complicate withdrawal as an outpatient. Following admission 
to the hospital, medications are withdrawn completely on the first 
day, in the absence of a contraindication. Antiemetics and fluids are 
administered as required; clonidine is used for opioid withdrawal 
symptoms.  For  acute  intolerable  pain  during  the  waking  hours, 
aspirin,  1  g  IV  (not  approved  in  the  United  States),  is  useful.  IM 
chlorpromazine can be helpful at night; patients must be adequately 
hydrated. Three to five days into the admission, as the effect of the 
withdrawn substance wears off, a course of IV dihydroergotamine 
(DHE) can be used. DHE, administered every 8 h for 5 consecutive 
days, a treatment that is not stopped short if headache settles, can 
induce  a  significant  remission  that  allows  a  preventive  treatment 
to  be  established.  Serotonin  5-HT3  receptor  antagonists,  such  as 
ondansetron or granisetron, or the neurokinin receptor antagonist, 
aprepitant, may be required with DHE to prevent significant nau-
sea, and domperidone (not approved in the United States) orally or 
by suppository can be very helpful. Avoiding sedating or otherwise 
side effect–prone antiemetics is helpful. 
NEW DAILY PERSISTENT HEADACHE
New  daily  persistent  headache  (NDPH)  is  a  clinically  distinct  syn-
drome with important secondary causes; these are listed in Table 16-4. 
Clinical Presentation  NDPH presents with headache on most if 
not all days, and the patient can clearly, and often vividly, recall the 
moment of onset. The headache usually begins abruptly, but onset 
may be more gradual; evolution over 3 days has been proposed as 
the upper limit for this syndrome. Patients typically recall the exact 
day  and  circumstances  of  the  onset  of  headache;  the  new,  persis-
tent  head  pain  does  not  remit.  The  first  priority  is  to  distinguish 
between a primary and a secondary cause of this syndrome. Sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage is the most serious of the secondary causes 
and must be excluded either by history or appropriate investigation 
(Chap. 429). 
Secondary NDPH  •  Low CSF Volume Headache 
In these 
syndromes, head pain is positional: it begins when the patient sits 
or stands upright and resolves upon reclining. The pain, which is 
occipitofrontal, is usually a dull ache but may be throbbing. Patients 
with  chronic  low  CSF  volume  headache  typically  present  with  a

history of headache from one day to the next that is generally not 
present on waking but worsens during the day. Recumbency usually 
improves the headache within minutes, and it can take only minutes to 
an hour for the pain to return when the patient resumes an upright 
position.

The most common cause of headache due to persistent low CSF 
volume  is  CSF  leak  following  LP  (Chap.  S9).  Post-LP  headache 
usually begins within 48 h but may be delayed for up to 12 days. 
Its  incidence  is  between  10%  and  30%.  Beverages  with  caffeine 
may provide temporary relief. Besides LP, index events may include 
epidural  injection  or  a  vigorous  Valsalva  maneuver,  such  as  from 
lifting,  straining,  coughing,  clearing  the  eustachian  tubes  in  an 
airplane,  or  multiple  orgasms.  Spontaneous  CSF  leaks  are  well 
recognized, and the diagnosis should be considered whenever the 
headache  history  is  typical,  even  when  there  is  no  obvious  index 
event.  As  time  passes  from  the  index  event,  the  postural  nature 
may become less apparent; cases in which the index event occurred 
several  years  before  the  eventual  diagnosis  have  been  recognized. 
Symptoms  appear  to  result  from  low  volume  rather  than  low 
pressure: although low CSF pressures, typically 0–50 mm CSF, are 
usually identified, a pressure as high as 140 mm CSF has been noted 
with a documented leak.

Postural  orthostatic  tachycardia  syndrome  (POTS;  Chap.  440) 
can present with orthostatic headache similar to low CSF volume 
headache and is a diagnosis that needs consideration in this setting.
When  imaging  is  indicated  to  identify  the  source  of  a  pre-
sumed leak, an MRI with gadolinium is the initial study of choice  
(Fig. 16-1). A striking pattern of diffuse meningeal enhancement 
is  so  typical  that  in  the  appropriate  clinical  context  the  diagnosis 
is  established.  Chiari  malformations  may  sometimes  be  noted  on 
MRI; in such cases, surgery to decompress the posterior fossa is not 
indicated  and  usually  worsens  the  headache.  Spinal  MRI  with  T2 
weighting may reveal a leak, and spinal MRI may demonstrate spi-
nal meningeal cysts whose role in these syndromes is yet to be elu-
cidated. The source of CSF leakage may be identified by spinal MRI 
with appropriate sequences, or by CT, preferably digital subtraction, 
myelography. In the absence of a directly identified site of leakage, 
111In-DTPA  CSF  studies  may  demonstrate  early  emptying  of  the 
tracer into the bladder or slow progress of tracer across the brain 
suggesting a CSF leak; this procedure is now only rarely employed.

Initial treatment for low CSF volume headache is bed rest. For 
patients  with  persistent  pain,  IV  caffeine  (500  mg  in  500  mL  of 
saline  administered  over  2  h)  can  be  very  effective.  An  electro-
cardiogram (ECG) to screen for arrhythmia should be performed 
before  administration.  It  is  reasonable  to  administer  at  least  two 
infusions of caffeine before embarking on additional tests to iden-
tify the source of the CSF leak. Because IV caffeine is safe and can 
be curative, it spares many patients the need for further investiga-
tions. If unsuccessful, an abdominal binder may be helpful. If a leak 
can be identified, an autologous blood patch is usually curative. A 
blood patch is also effective for post-LP headache; in this setting, 
the  location  is  empirically  determined  to  be  the  site  of  the  LP.  In 
patients  with  intractable  headache,  oral  theophylline  is  a  useful 
alternative that can take some months to be effective. 
Raised CSF Pressure Headache  Raised CSF pressure is well rec-
ognized as a cause of headache. Brain imaging can often reveal the 
cause, such as a space-occupying lesion. 
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)   
NDPH due to raised CSF pressure can be the presenting symptom 
for  patients  with  idiopathic  intracranial  hypertension,  a  disorder 
associated with obesity, female gender, and, on occasion, pregnancy. 
The syndrome can also occur without visual problems, particularly 
when  the  fundi  are  normal.  These  patients  typically  present  with 
a  history  of  generalized  headache  that  is  present  on  waking  and 
improves as the day goes on. It is generally present on awakening 
in  the  morning  and  is  worse  with  recumbency.  Transient  visual 
obscurations  are  frequent  and  may  occur  when  the  headaches 
are  most  severe.  The  diagnosis  is  relatively  straightforward  when 
papilledema is present, but the possibility must be considered even 
in patients without funduscopic changes. Formal visual field test-
ing should be performed even in the absence of overt ophthalmic 
involvement. Partial obstructions of the cerebral venous sinuses are 
found in a small number of cases. In addition, persistently raised 
intracranial pressure can trigger a syndrome of chronic migraine. 
Other conditions that characteristically produce headache on rising 
in the morning or nocturnal headache are obstructive sleep apnea 
or poorly controlled hypertension.

Evaluation  of  patients  suspected  to  have  raised  CSF  pressure 
requires brain imaging. It is most efficient to obtain an MRI, includ-
ing an MR venogram, as the initial study. If there are no contraindi-
cations, the CSF pressure should be measured by LP; this should be 
done when the patient is symptomatic so that both the pressure and 
the response to removal of 20–30 mL of CSF can be determined. An 
elevated opening pressure and improvement in headache following 
removal of CSF are diagnostic in the absence of fundal changes.

Initial  treatment  is  with  acetazolamide  (250–500  mg  bid);  the 
headache  may  improve  within  weeks.  If  ineffective,  topiramate  is 
the next treatment of choice; it has many actions that may be useful 
in this setting, including carbonic anhydrase inhibition, weight loss, 
and neuronal membrane stabilization, likely mediated via effects on 
phosphorylation  pathways.  Severely  disabled  patients  who  do  not 
respond  to  medical  treatment  require  intracranial  pressure  moni-
toring and may require shunting. If appropriate, weight loss should 
be encouraged. 
Posttraumatic  Headache  A  traumatic  event  can  trigger  a  head-
ache  process  that  lasts  for  many  months  or  years  after  the  event. 
The term trauma is used here in a very broad sense: headache can 
develop  following  an  injury  to  the  head,  but  it  can  also  develop 
after an infectious episode, typically viral meningitis; a flulike ill-
ness; or a parasitic infection. Complaints of dizziness, vertigo, and 
impaired  memory  can  accompany  the  headache.  Symptoms  may 
remit after several weeks or persist for months and even years after 
the injury. Typically, the neurologic examination is normal and CT 
or MRI studies are unrevealing. Chronic subdural hematoma may 

on occasion mimic this disorder. Posttraumatic headache may also 
be seen after carotid dissection and subarachnoid hemorrhage and 
after intracranial surgery. The underlying theme appears to be that 
a traumatic event involving the pain-producing meninges can trig-
ger a headache process that lasts for many years. 
Other  Causes 
In  one  series,  one-third  of  patients  with  NDPH 
reported headache beginning after a transient flulike illness charac-
terized by fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, and marked malaise. 
Evaluation  typically  reveals  no  apparent  cause  for  the  headache. 
There is no convincing evidence that persistent Epstein-Barr virus 
infection plays a role in NDPH. A complicating factor is that many 
patients  undergo  LP  during  the  acute  illness;  iatrogenic  low  CSF 
volume headache must be considered in these cases. 
Treatment  Treatment  is  largely  empirical  and  directed  at  the 
headache  phenotype.  Tricyclic  antidepressants,  notably  amitrip-
tyline,  and  anticonvulsants,  such  as  topiramate,  valproate,  cande-
sartan, and gabapentin, have been used with reported benefit. The 
monoamine  oxidase  inhibitor  phenelzine  may  also  be  useful  in 
carefully  selected  patients.  The  headache  usually  resolves  within 
3–5 years, but it can be quite disabling.

PRIMARY CARE AND HEADACHE 
MANAGEMENT
Most patients with headache will be seen first in a primary care setting. 
The  challenging  task  of  the  primary  care  physician  is  to  identify  the 
very few worrisome secondary headaches from the very great majority 
of primary and less dangerous secondary headaches (Table 16-2).

Absent any warning signs, a reasonable approach is to treat when a 
diagnosis is established. As a general rule, the investigation should focus 
on identifying worrisome causes of headache or on helping the patient 
to gain confidence if no primary headache diagnosis can be made.

After  treatment  has  been  initiated,  follow-up  care  is  essential  to 
identify  whether  progress  has  been  made  against  the  headache  com-
plaint.  Not  all  headaches  will  respond  to  treatment,  but,  in  general, 
worrisome headaches will progress and will be easier to identify.

When  a  primary  care  physician  feels  the  diagnosis  is  a  primary 
headache disorder, it is worth noting that >90% of patients who pres-
ent to primary care with a complaint of headache will have migraine 
(Chap. 430).

In general, patients who do not have a clear diagnosis, have a pri-
mary headache disorder other than migraine or tension-type headache, 
or are unresponsive to two or more standard therapies for the consid-
ered headache type, should be considered for referral to a specialist. In 
a practical sense, the threshold for referral is also determined by the 
experience of the primary care physician in headache medicine and the 
availability of secondary care options.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases17 Back and Neck Pain

John W. Engstrom

The importance of back and neck pain in our society is underscored 
by the following: (1) the cost of chronic back pain in the United States 
is  estimated  at  more  than  $200  billion  annually;  approximately  one-
third of this cost is due to direct health care expenses and two-thirds 
are  indirect  costs  resulting  from  loss  of  wages  and  productivity;  (2) 
back symptoms are the most common cause of disability in individuals 
<45 years of age; (3) low back pain (LBP) is the second most common 
reason for visiting a physician in the United States; and (4) more than 
four  out  of  five  people  will  experience  significant  back  pain  at  some 
point in their lives.

ANATOMY OF THE SPINE
The anterior spine consists of cylindrical vertebral bodies separated by 
intervertebral disks and stabilized by the anterior and posterior longitu-
dinal ligaments. The intervertebral disks are composed of a central gelat-
inous nucleus pulposus surrounded by a tough cartilaginous ring, the 
annulus fibrosis. Disks are responsible for 25% of spinal column length 
and allow the bony vertebrae to move easily upon each other (Figs. 17-1 
and 17-2). Desiccation of the nucleus pulposus and degeneration of the 
annulus fibrosus worsen with age, resulting in loss of disk height. The 
disks are largest in the cervical and lumbar regions where movements 
of the spine are greatest. The anterior spine absorbs the shock of bodily 
movements such as walking and running, and with the posterior spine 
protects the spinal cord and nerve roots in the spinal canal.

The posterior spine consists of the vertebral arches and processes. 
Each arch consists of paired cylindrical pedicles anteriorly and paired 
lamina posteriorly. The vertebral arch also gives rise to two transverse 
processes laterally, one spinous process posteriorly, plus two superior 
and  two  inferior  articular  facets.  The  apposition  of  a  superior  and 
inferior facet constitutes a facet joint. The posterior spine provides an 
anchor for the attachment of muscles and ligaments. The contraction 
of muscles attached to the spinous and transverse processes and lamina 
works like a system of pulleys and levers producing flexion, extension, 
rotation, and lateral bending movements of the spine.

Nerve root injury (radiculopathy) is a common cause of pain in the 
neck  and  arm,  or  low  back  and  buttock,  or  leg  (see  dermatomes  in 
Figs. 25-2 and 25-3). Each nerve root exits just above its correspond-
ing vertebral body in the cervical region (e.g., the C7 nerve root exits

at the C6-C7 level), and just below the vertebral body in the thoracic 
and lumbar spine (e.g., the T1 nerve root exits at the T1-T2 level). The 
cervical nerve roots follow a short intraspinal course before exiting. In 
contrast, because the spinal cord ends at the L1 or L2 vertebral level, 
the  lumbar  nerve  roots  follow  a  long  intraspinal  course  and  can  be 
injured  anywhere  along  its  path.  For  example,  disk  herniation  at  the 
L4-L5 level can produce L4 root compression laterally, but more often 
compression  of  the  traversing  L5  nerve  root  occurs  (Fig.  17-3).  The 
lumbar nerve roots are mobile in the spinal canal, but eventually pass 
through the narrow lateral recess of the spinal canal and intervertebral

foramen (Figs. 17-2 and 17-3). When imaging the spine, both sagittal 
and axial views are needed to assess possible compression at these sites.
Beginning  at  the  C3  level,  each  cervical  (and  the  first  thoracic) 
vertebral  body  projects  a  lateral  bony  process  upward—the  uncinate 
process.  The  uncinate  process  articulates  with  the  cervical  vertebral 
body  above  via  the  uncovertebral  joint.  The  uncovertebral  joint  can 
hypertrophy  with  age  and  contribute  to  neural  foraminal  narrowing 
and cervical radiculopathy.

Pain-sensitive structures of the spine include the periosteum of the 
vertebrae, dura, facet joints, annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disk, 
epidural veins and arteries, and the longitudinal ligaments. Disease of 
these diverse structures may explain many cases of back pain without 
nerve  root  compression.  Under  normal  circumstances,  the  nucleus 
pulposus of the intervertebral disk is not pain sensitive.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Back Pain 

TYPES OF BACK PAIN
Delineating the type of pain reported by the patient is the essential 
first step. Attention is also focused on identifying risk factors for a 
serious  underlying  etiology.  The  most  frequent  serious  causes  of 
back pain are radiculopathy, fracture, tumor, infection, or referred 
pain from visceral structures (Table 17-1).

Local  pain  is  caused  by  injury  to  pain-sensitive  structures  that 
compress or irritate sensory nerve endings. The site of the pain is 
near the affected part of the back.

Pain referred to the back may arise from abdominal or pelvic vis-
cera. The pain is usually described as primarily abdominal or pelvic, 
accompanied by back pain, and usually unaffected by posture. The 
patient may occasionally complain of back pain only.

Pain of spine origin may be located in the back or referred to the 
buttocks or legs. Diseases affecting the upper lumbar spine tend to 
refer pain to the lumbar region, groin, or anterior thighs. Diseases 
affecting the lower lumbar spine tend to produce pain referred to 
the  buttocks,  posterior  thighs,  calves,  or  feet.  Referred  pain  often 
explains  pain  syndromes  that  cross  multiple  dermatomes  without 
evidence of nerve or nerve root injury.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesRadicular pain is typically sharp and radiates from the low back 
to  a  leg  within  the  territory  of  a  nerve  root  (see  “Lumbar  Disk 
Disease,” below). Coughing, sneezing, or voluntary contraction of 
abdominal muscles (lifting heavy objects or straining at stool) may 
elicit or worsen the radiating pain. The pain may also increase in 
postures that stretch the nerves and nerve roots. Sitting with the leg 
outstretched places traction on the sciatic nerve and L5 and S1 roots 
because the sciatic nerve passes posterior to the hip. The femoral 
nerve (L2, L3, and L4 roots) passes anterior to the hip and is not 
stretched  by  sitting.  The  description  of  the  pain  alone  often  fails 
to distinguish between referred pain and radiculopathy, although a 
burning or electric quality favors radiculopathy.

Pain associated with muscle spasm is commonly associated with 
many  spine  disorders.  The  spasms  may  be  accompanied  by  an 
abnormal posture, tense paraspinal muscles, and dull or achy pain 
in the paraspinal region.

Knowledge  of  the  circumstances  associated  with  the  onset  of 
back pain is important when weighing possible serious underlying 
causes for the pain. Some patients involved in accidents or work- 
related injuries may exaggerate their pain for the purpose of com-
pensation or for psychological reasons. 
EXAMINATION
A  complete  physical  examination  including  vital  signs,  heart  and 
lungs,  abdomen  and  rectum,  and  limbs  is  advisable.  Back  pain 
referred from visceral organs may be reproduced during palpation 
of the abdomen (pancreatitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA]) 
or percussion over the costovertebral angles (pyelonephritis).

The  normal  spine  has  a  cervical  and  lumbar  lordosis  and  a 
thoracic  kyphosis.  Exaggeration  of  these  normal  alignments  may 
result in hyperkyphosis of the thoracic spine or hyperlordosis of the 
lumbar spine. Inspection of the back may reveal a lateral curvature 
of the spine (scoliosis). A midline hair tuft, skin dimpling or pig-
mentation, or a sinus tract may indicate a congenital spine anomaly. 
Asymmetry in the prominence of the paraspinal muscles suggests 
muscle spasm. Palpation over the spinous process transmits force to 
the entire vertebrae and suggests vertebral pathology.

Flexion at the hips is normal in patients with lumbar spine dis-
ease, but flexion of the lumbar spine is limited and sometimes pain-
ful. Lateral bending to the side opposite the injured spinal element 
may  stretch  the  damaged  tissues,  worsen  pain,  and  limit  motion. 
Hyperextension  of  the  spine  (with  the  patient  prone  or  standing) 
is  limited  when  nerve  root  compression,  facet  joint  pathology,  or 
other bony spine disease is present.

Pain from hip disease may mimic the pain of lumbar spine dis-
ease. Hip pain can be reproduced by passive internal and external 
rotation at the hip with the knee and hip in flexion or by percussing 
the heel with the examiner’s palm with the leg extended (heel per-
cussion sign).

The straight-leg raising (SLR) maneuver is a simple bedside test 
for nerve root disease. With the patient supine, passive straight-
leg flexion at the hip stretches the L5 and S1 nerve roots and the 
sciatic nerve; dorsiflexion of the foot during the maneuver adds 
to the stretch. In healthy individuals, flexion to at least 80° is nor-
mally possible without causing pain, although a tight, stretching 
sensation  in  the  hamstring  muscles  is  common.  The  SLR  test  is 
positive  if  the  maneuver  reproduces  the  patient’s  usual  back  or 
limb  pain.  Eliciting  the  SLR  sign  in  both  the  supine  and  sitting 
positions  can  help  determine  if  the  finding  is  reproducible.  The 
patient  may  describe  pain  in  the  low  back,  buttocks,  posterior 
thigh,  or  lower  leg,  but  the  key  feature  is  reproduction  of  the 
patient’s usual pain. The crossed SLR sign is present when flexion 
of  one  leg  reproduces  the  usual  pain  in  the  opposite  leg  or  but-
tocks. In disk herniation, the crossed SLR sign is less sensitive but 
more specific than the SLR sign. The reverse SLR sign is elicited by 
standing the patient next to the examination table and passively 
extending each leg with the knee fully extended. This maneuver, 
which  stretches  the  L2-L4  nerve  roots,  lumbosacral  plexus,  and 
femoral nerve, is considered positive if the patient’s usual back or 
limb pain is reproduced. For all of these tests, the nerve or nerve 
root lesion is always on the side of the pain. Examination of the 
unaffected leg first provides a control test, ensures mutual under-
standing of test parameters, and enhances test utility.

The neurologic examination includes a search for focal weakness 
or muscle atrophy, localized reflex changes, diminished sensation in 
the legs, or signs of spinal cord injury. The examiner should be alert 
to the possibility of breakaway weakness, defined as fluctuations in 
the maximum power generated during muscle testing. Breakaway 
weakness may be due to pain, inattention, or a combination of pain 
and underlying true weakness. Breakaway weakness without pain is 
usually due to a lack of effort. In uncertain cases, electromyography 
(EMG) can determine if true weakness due to nerve tissue injury is 
present. Findings with specific lumbosacral nerve root lesions are 
shown in Table 17-2 and are discussed below. 
LABORATORY, IMAGING, AND EMG STUDIES
Laboratory  studies  are  rarely  needed  for  the  initial  evaluation  of 
nonspecific  acute  (<3  months  duration)  low  back  pain  (ALBP).

Risk factors for a serious underlying cause and for infection, tumor, 
or  fracture  in  particular  should  be  sought  by  history  and  exami-
nation.  If  risk  factors  are  present  (Table  17-1),  then  laboratory 
studies  (complete  blood  count  [CBC],  erythrocyte  sedimentation 
rate [ESR], urinalysis) are indicated. If risk factors are absent, then 
management is conservative (see “Treatment,” below).

CT scanning is used as a primary screening modality for acute 
trauma  that  is  moderate  to  severe.  CT  is  superior  to  x-rays  for 
detection of fractures involving posterior spine structures, cranio-
cervical and cervicothoracic junctions, C1 and C2 vertebrae, bone 
fragments in the spinal canal, or misalignment. MRI or CT myelog-
raphy is the radiologic test of choice for evaluation of most serious 
diseases involving the spine. MRI is superior for the definition of 
soft  tissue  structures,  whereas  CT  myelography  provides  optimal 
imaging of the lateral recess of the spinal canal, defines bony abnor-
malities, and is tolerated by claustrophobic patients.

Population  surveys  in  the  United  States  suggest  that  patients 
with back pain report greater functional limitations in recent years, 
despite rapid increases in spine imaging, opioid prescribing, injec-
tions,  and  spine  surgery.  This  suggests  that  more  selective  use  of 
diagnostic  and  treatment  modalities  may  be  reasonable  for  many 
patients. One prospective case-control study found that older adults 
with  back  pain  of  less  than  6  weeks  duration  who  received  spine 
imaging as part of a primary care visit had no better outcomes than 
the control group.

Spine  imaging  often  reveals  abnormalities  of  dubious  clinical 
relevance that may alarm clinicians and patients alike and prompt 
further  testing  and  unnecessary  therapy.  When  imaging  tests  are 
reviewed,  it  is  important  to  remember  that  degenerative  findings 
are  common  in  normal,  pain-free  individuals.  Randomized  trials 
and  observational  studies  have  suggested  that  imaging  can  have 
a  “cascade  effect,”  creating  a  gateway  to  other  unnecessary  care. 
Interventions have included physician education and computerized 
decision  support  within  the  electronic  medical  record  to  require 
specific indications for approval of imaging tests. Other strategies 
have included audit and feedback of individual practitioners’ rates 
of ordering, more rapid access to physical therapy, or consultation 
with spine experts for patients without imaging indications.

Educational tools created by the America College of Physicians 
for patients and the public have included “Five Things Physicians 
and  Patients  Should  Question”:  (1)  Do  not  recommend  advanced 
imaging  (e.g.,  MRI)  of  the  spine  within  the  first  6  weeks  in 
patients with nonspecific ALBP in the absence of red flags. (2) Do 
not  perform  elective  spinal  injections  without  imaging  guidance, 
unless contraindicated. (3) Do not use bone morphogenetic protein 
(BMP)  for  routine  anterior  cervical  spine  fusion  surgery.  (4)  Do 
not  use  EMG  and  nerve  conduction  studies  (NCSs)  to  determine 
the cause of purely midline lumbar, thoracic, or cervical spine pain. 
(5) Do not recommend bed rest for >48 h when treating LBP. In an 
observational study, application of this strategy was associated with 
lower rates of repeat imaging, opioid use, and referrals for physical 
therapy.

Electrodiagnostic  studies  can  be  used  to  assess  the  functional 
integrity  of  the  peripheral  nervous  system  (Chap.  446).  Sensory 
NCSs are normal when focal sensory loss confirmed by examination 
is due to nerve root damage because the nerve roots are proximal 
to the nerve cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia. Injury to nerve 
tissue distal to the dorsal root ganglion (e.g., plexus or peripheral 
nerve) results in reduced sensory nerve signals. Needle EMG com-
plements NCSs by detecting denervation or reinnervation changes 
in a myotomal (segmental) distribution. Multiple muscles supplied 
by  different  nerve  roots  and  nerves  are  sampled;  the  pattern  of 
muscle involvement indicates the nerve root(s) responsible for the 
injury.  Needle  EMG  provides  objective  information  about  motor 
nerve fiber injury when clinical evaluation of weakness is limited by 
pain or poor effort. EMG and NCSs will be normal when sensory 
nerve root injury or irritation is the pain source.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and complicated the care 
of patients with LBP. Paraspinal myalgias may result in LBP. The seden-
tary lifestyle resulting from quarantine is associated with an increased 
frequency or severity of LBP. Fear of infection risk has also prevented 
many  patients  from  seeking  needed  care.  Video-telemedicine  visits 
can help identify patients with underlying risks for a serious cause and 
inform appropriate next steps in management.

CAUSES OF BACK PAIN (TABLE 17-3)
 ■ LUMBAR DISK DISEASE
Lumbar disk disease is a common cause of acute, chronic, or recurrent 
low back and leg pain (Figs. 17-3 and 17-4). Disk disease is most likely 
to occur at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 levels, but upper lumbar levels can also 
be involved. The cause is often unknown, but the risk is increased in 
overweight individuals. Disk herniation is unusual prior to age 20 years 
and is rare in the fibrotic disks of the elderly. Complex genetic factors 
may play a role in predisposition. The pain may be located in the low 
back  only  or  referred  to  a  leg,  buttock,  or  hip.  A  sneeze,  cough,  or 
trivial movement may cause the nucleus pulposus to prolapse, pushing 
the frayed and weakened annulus posteriorly. With severe disk disease, 
the nucleus can protrude through the annulus (herniation) or become 
extruded to lie as a free fragment in the spinal canal.

in  patients  with  known  disk  herniation  treated  either 
medically  or  surgically,  persistence  of  the  herniation  10 
years  later  had  no  relationship  to  the  clinical  outcome. 
In  summary,  MRI  findings  of  disk  protrusion,  tears  in 
the  annulus  fibrosus,  or  hypertrophic  facet  joints  are 
common incidental findings that, by themselves, should 
not dictate management decisions for patients with back 
pain.

The diagnosis of nerve root injury is most secure when 
the history, examination, results of imaging studies, and 
the EMG are concordant. There is often good correlation 
between CT and EMG findings for localization of nerve 
root injury.

FIGURE  17-4  Disk  herniation.  A.  Sagittal  T2-weighted  image  on  the  left  side  of  the  spinal  canal

herniation with displacement of the thecal sac medially and the left L5 nerve root posteriorly in the 
left lateral recess. 

The  mechanism  by  which  intervertebral  disk  injury  causes  back 
pain  is  uncertain.  The  inner  annulus  fibrosus  and  nucleus  pulposus 
are normally devoid of innervation. Inflammation and production of 
proinflammatory  cytokines  within  a  ruptured  nucleus  pulposus  may 
trigger or perpetuate back pain. Ingrowth of nociceptive (pain) nerve 
fibers into the nucleus pulposus of a diseased disk may be responsible 
for some cases of chronic “diskogenic” pain. Nerve root injury (radic-
ulopathy)  from  disk  herniation  is  usually  due  to  inflammation,  but 
lateral  herniation  may  produce  compression  in  the  lateral  recess  or 
intervertebral foramen.

A  ruptured  disk  may  be  asymptomatic  or  cause  back  pain,  lim-
ited spine motion (particularly flexion), a focal neurologic deficit, or 
radicular pain. A dermatomal pattern of sensory loss or a reduced or 
absent deep tendon reflex is more suggestive of a specific root lesion 
than  is  the  pattern  of  pain.  Motor  findings  (focal  weakness,  muscle 
atrophy, or fasciculations) occur less frequently than focal sensory or 
reflex changes. Symptoms and signs are usually unilateral, but bilateral 
involvement does occur with large central disk herniations that involve 
roots bilaterally or cause inflammation of nerve roots within the spinal 
canal. Clinical manifestations of specific nerve root lesions are summa-
rized in Table 17-2.

The  differential  diagnosis  covers  a  variety  of  serious  and  treatable 
conditions, including epidural abscess, hematoma, fracture, or tumor. 
Fever,  constant  pain  uninfluenced  by  position,  sphincter  abnormal-
ities,  or  signs  of  myelopathy  suggest  an  etiology  other  than  lumbar 
disk disease. Absent ankle reflexes can be a normal finding in persons  
>60 years or a sign of bilateral S1 radiculopathies. An absent deep ten-
don reflex or focal sensory loss may indicate injury to a nerve root, but 
other sites of injury along the nerve must also be considered. As exam-
ples, an absent knee reflex may be due to a femoral neuropathy or an L4 
nerve root injury; loss of sensation over the foot and lateral lower calf 
may result from a peroneal or lateral sciatic neuropathy, or an L5 nerve 
root  injury.  Focal  muscle  atrophy  may  reflect  injury  to  the  anterior 
horn cells of the spinal cord, a nerve root, peripheral nerve, or disuse.
A lumbar spine MRI scan or CT myelogram can often confirm the 
location  and  type  of  pathology.  Spine  MRIs  yield  exquisite  views  of 
intraspinal and adjacent soft tissue anatomy, whereas bony lesions of 
the  lateral  recess  or  intervertebral  foramen  are  optimally  visualized 
by  CT  myelography.  The  correlation  of  neuroradiologic  findings  to 
clinical symptoms, particularly pain, is not simple. Contrast-enhancing 
tears in the annulus fibrosus or disk protrusions are widely accepted as 
common sources of back pain; however, studies have found that many 
asymptomatic adults have similar radiologic findings. Entirely asymp-
tomatic  disk  protrusions  are  also  common,  occurring  in  up  to  one-
third of adults, and these may also enhance with contrast. Furthermore, 

Management of lumbar disk disease is discussed below.
Cauda  equina  syndrome  (CES)  signifies  an  injury  of 
multiple lumbosacral nerve roots within the spinal canal 
distal to the termination of the spinal cord at L1-L2. LBP, 
weakness and areflexia in the legs, saddle anesthesia, or 
loss  of  bladder  function  may  occur.  The  problem  must 
be distinguished from disorders of the lower spinal cord 
(conus  medullaris  syndrome),  acute  transverse  myelitis 
(Chap. 442), and Guillain-Barré syndrome (Chap. 447). 
Combined  involvement  of  the  conus  medullaris  and 
cauda equina can occur. CES is most commonly due to a large ruptured 
lumbosacral intervertebral disk, but other causes include lumbosacral 
spine fracture, hematoma within the spinal canal (sometimes following 
lumbar puncture in patients with coagulopathy), and tumor or other 
compressive  mass  lesions.  Treatment  is  usually  surgical  decompres-
sion, sometimes on an urgent basis in an attempt to restore or preserve 
motor  or  sphincter  function,  or  radiotherapy  for  metastatic  tumors 
(Chap. 90).

 ■ DEGENERATIVE CONDITIONS
Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) describes a narrowed lumbar spinal canal. 
Neurogenic claudication consists of pain, typically in the back and but-
tocks or legs, that is brought on by walking or standing and relieved 
by sitting. Unlike vascular claudication, symptoms are often provoked 
by  standing  without  walking.  Unlike  lumbar  disk  disease,  symptoms 
are  usually  relieved  by  sitting.  Patients  with  neurogenic  claudication 
can  often  walk  much  farther  when  leaning  over  a  shopping  cart  and 
can pedal a stationary bike with ease while sitting. These flexed posi-
tions  increase  the  anteroposterior  spinal  canal  diameter  and  reduce 
intraspinal  venous  hypertension,  producing  pain  relief.  Focal  weak-
ness, sensory loss, or reflex changes may occur when spinal stenosis is 
associated with neural foraminal narrowing and radiculopathy. Severe 
neurologic  deficits,  including  paralysis  and  urinary  incontinence, 
occur only rarely.

LSS  by  itself  is  common  (6–7%  of  adults)  and  is  usually  asymp-
tomatic.  Symptoms  are  correlated  with  severe  spinal  canal  stenosis. 
LSS is most often acquired (75%) but can also be congenital or due to 
a  mixture  of  both  etiologies.  Congenital  forms  (achondroplasia  and 
idiopathic)  are  characterized  by  short,  thick  pedicles  that  produce 
both spinal canal and lateral recess stenosis. Acquired factors that con-
tribute  to  spinal  stenosis  include  degenerative  diseases  (spondylosis, 
spondylolisthesis,  and  scoliosis),  trauma,  spine  surgery,  metabolic  or 
endocrine  disorders  (epidural  lipomatosis,  osteoporosis,  acromegaly, 
renal  osteodystrophy,  and  hypoparathyroidism),  and  Paget’s  disease. 
MRI provides the best definition of the abnormal anatomy (Fig. 17-5).
LSS  accompanied  by  neurogenic  claudication  responds  to  surgical 
decompression of the stenotic segments. The same processes leading to 
LSS may cause lumbar foraminal or lateral recess narrowing resulting 
in coincident lumbar radiculopathy that may require treatment as well.
Conservative  treatment  of  symptomatic  LSS  can  include  nonste-
roidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  acetaminophen,  exercise 
programs, and symptomatic treatment of acute pain episodes. There is 
insufficient evidence to support the routine use of epidural glucocorti-
coid injections. Surgery is considered when medical therapy does not 
relieve  symptoms  sufficiently  to  allow  for  resumption  of  activities  of

daily living or when focal neurologic signs are present. Most patients 
with  neurogenic  claudication  who  are  treated  medically  do  not 
improve  over  time.  Surgical  management  with  laminectomy,  which 
increases the spinal canal diameter and reduces venous hypertension, 
can produce significant relief of exertional back and leg pain, leading 
to less disability and improved functional outcomes. Laminectomy and 
fusion is usually reserved for patients with LSS and spondylolisthesis. 
Predictors of a poor surgical outcome include impaired walking pre-
operatively,  depression,  cardiovascular  disease,  and  scoliosis.  Up  to 
one-quarter of surgically treated patients develop recurrent stenosis at 
the same or an adjacent spinal level within 7–10 years; recurrent symp-
toms usually respond to a second surgical decompression.

Neural foraminal narrowing or lateral recess stenosis with radiculop-
athy is a common consequence of osteoarthritic processes that cause 
LSS (Figs. 17-1 and 17-6), including osteophytes, lateral disk protru-
sion, calcified disk-osteophytes, facet joint hypertrophy, uncovertebral 

joint hypertrophy (in the cervical spine), congenitally 
shortened  pedicles,  or,  frequently,  a  combination  of 
these  processes.  Neoplasms  (primary  or  metastatic), 
fractures, infections (epidural abscess), or hematomas 
are less frequent causes. Most common is bony foram-
inal  narrowing  leading  to  nerve  root  ischemia  and 
persistent symptoms, in contrast to inflammation that 
is  associated  with  a  paracentral  herniated  disk  and 
radiculopathy.  These  conditions  can  produce  unilat-
eral nerve root symptoms or signs due to compression 
at the intervertebral foramen or in the lateral recess; 
symptoms  are  indistinguishable  from  disk-related 
radiculopathy, but treatment may differ depending on 
the etiology. The history and neurologic examination 
alone  cannot  distinguish  between  these  possibilities. 
Neuroimaging (CT or MRI) is required to identify the 
anatomic cause. Neurologic findings from the exami-
nation and EMG can help direct the attention of the 
radiologist to specific nerve roots, especially on axial 
images.  For  facet  joint  hypertrophy  with  foraminal 
stenosis,  surgical  foraminotomy  produces  long-term 
relief  of  leg  and  back  pain  in  80–90%  of  patients. 
Facet joint or medial branch blocks for back or neck 
pain are sometimes used to help determine the anatomic origin of back 
pain or for treatment, but there is a lack of clinical data to support their 
utility. Medical causes of lumbar or cervical radiculopathy unrelated to 
primary spine disease include infections (e.g., herpes zoster and Lyme 
disease),  carcinomatous  meningitis,  diabetes,  and  root  avulsion  or 
traction (trauma).

 ■ SPONDYLOSIS AND SPONDYLOLISTHESIS
Spondylosis,  or  osteoarthritic  spine  disease,  typically  occurs  in  later 
life  and  primarily  involves  the  cervical  and  lumbosacral  spine. 
Patients  often  complain  of  back  pain  that  increases  with  move-
ment,  is  associated  with  stiffness,  and  is  better  with  inactivity.  The 
relationship  between  clinical  symptoms  and  radiologic  findings  is 
usually not straightforward. Pain may be prominent when MRI, CT, 
or x-ray findings  are  minimal,  and  prominent  degenerative  spine 
disease can be seen in asymptomatic patients. Osteophytes, combined

disk-osteophytes,  or  a  thickened  ligamentum  flavum  may  cause  or 
contribute to central spinal canal stenosis, lateral recess stenosis, or 
neural foraminal narrowing.

Spondylolisthesis is the anterior slippage of the vertebral body, pedi-
cles, and superior articular facets, leaving the posterior elements behind. 
Spondylolisthesis  can  be  associated  with  spondylolysis,  congenital 
anomalies,  degenerative  spine  disease,  or  other  causes  of  mechanical 
weakness of the pars interarticularis (e.g., infection, osteoporosis, tumor, 
trauma,  earlier  surgery).  The  slippage  may  be  asymptomatic  or  may 
cause LBP, nerve root injury (the L5 root most frequently), symptomatic 
spinal  stenosis,  or  CES  in  rare  severe  cases.  A  “step-off”  on  palpation 
or tenderness may be elicited near the segment that has “slipped” (most 
often L4 on L5 or occasionally L5 on S1). Focal anterolisthesis or retrolis-
thesis can occur at any cervical or lumbar level and be the source of neck 
or LBP. Plain x-rays of the low back or neck in flexion and extension will 
reveal movement at the abnormal spinal segment. Surgery is performed 
for spinal instability (slippage 5–8 mm) and considered for pain symp-
toms that do not respond to conservative measures (e.g., rest, physical 
therapy), cases with a progressive neurologic deficit, or scoliosis.

 ■ NEOPLASMS
Back pain is the most common neurologic symptom in patients with 
systemic cancer and is the presenting symptom in 20%. The cause is 
usually  vertebral  body  metastasis  (85–90%)  but  can  also  result  from 
spread  of  cancer  through  the  intervertebral  foramen  (especially  with 
lymphoma),  carcinomatous  meningitis,  or  metastasis  to  the  spinal 
cord.  The  thoracic  spine  is  most  often  affected.  Cancer-related  back 
pain tends to be constant, dull, unrelieved by rest, and worse at night. 
By contrast, mechanical causes of LBP usually improve with rest. MRI, 
CT, and CT myelography are the studies of choice when spinal metas-
tasis  is  suspected.  Once  a  metastasis  is  found,  imaging  of  the  entire 
spine is essential, as it reveals additional tumor deposits in one-third of 
patients. MRI is preferred for soft tissue definition, but the most rap-
idly available imaging modality is best because the patient’s condition 
may worsen quickly without intervention. Early diagnosis is crucial. A 
strong  predictor  of  outcome  is  baseline  neurologic  function  prior  to 
diagnosis. Half to three-quarters of patients are nonambulatory at the 
time of diagnosis and few regain the ability to walk. The management 
of spinal metastasis is discussed in detail in Chap. 90.

 ■ INFECTIONS/INFLAMMATION
Vertebral osteomyelitis is most often caused by hematogenous seeding 
of staphylococci, but other bacteria or tuberculosis (Pott’s disease) may 
be responsible. The primary source of infection is usually the skin or 
urinary tract. Other common sources of bacteremia are IV drug use, 
poor  dentition,  endocarditis,  lung  abscess,  IV  catheters,  or  postop-
erative  wound  sites.  Back  pain  at  rest,  tenderness  over  the  involved 
vertebra,  and  an  elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  (ESR)  or 
C-reactive protein (CRP) are the most common findings in vertebral 
osteomyelitis. Fever or an elevated white blood cell count is found in 
a minority of patients. MRI and CT are sensitive and specific for early 
detection of osteomyelitis. The intervertebral disk can also be affected 
by  infection  (diskitis)  and  almost  never  by  tumor.  Extension  of  the 
infection  posteriorly  from  the  vertebral  body  can  produce  a  spinal 
epidural abscess.

Spinal epidural abscess (Chap. 442) presents with back pain (aggra-
vated by movement or palpation of the spinous process), fever, radicul-
opathy, or signs of spinal cord compression. The subacute development 
of two or more of these findings should increase suspicion for spinal 
epidural abscess. The abscess is best delineated by spine MRI and may 
track over multiple spinal levels.

Lumbar adhesive arachnoiditis with radiculopathy is due to fibrosis 
following  inflammation  within  the  subarachnoid  space.  The  fibrosis 
results  in  nerve  root  adhesions  and  presents  as  back  and  leg  pain 
associated with multifocal motor, sensory, or reflex changes. Causes of 
arachnoiditis include multiple lumbar operations (most common in the 
United States), chronic spinal infections (especially tuberculosis in the 
developing  world),  spinal  cord  injury,  intrathecal  hemorrhage,  myel-
ography (rare), intrathecal injections (glucocorticoids, anesthetics, or 

other  agents),  and  foreign  bodies.  The  MRI  shows  clumped  nerve 
roots  on  axial  views  or  loculations  of  cerebrospinal  fluid  within  the 
thecal sac. Clumped nerve roots should be distinguished from enlarged 
nerve  roots  seen  with  demyelinating  polyneuropathy  or  neoplastic 
infiltration. Treatment is usually unsatisfactory. Microsurgical lysis of 
adhesions, dorsal rhizotomy, dorsal root ganglionectomy, and epidural 
glucocorticoids have been tried, but outcomes have been poor. Dorsal 
column stimulation for pain relief has produced varying results.

 ■ TRAUMA
A patient complaining of back pain and an inability to move the legs 
may have a spine fracture or dislocation; fractures above L1 place the 
spinal cord at risk for compression. Care must be taken to avoid further 
damage  to  the  spinal  cord  or  nerve  roots  by  immobilizing  the  back 
or  neck  pending  the  results  of  radiologic  studies.  Vertebral  fractures 
frequently occur in the absence of trauma in association with osteopo-
rosis, glucocorticoid use, osteomyelitis, or neoplastic infiltration.

Sprains  and  Strains  The  terms  low  back  sprain,  strain,  and 
mechanically induced muscle spasm refer to minor, self-limited injuries 
associated with lifting a heavy object, a fall, or a sudden deceleration 
such as in an automobile accident. These terms are used loosely and do 
not correlate with specific underlying pathologies. The pain is usually 
confined  to  the  lower  back.  Patients  with  paraspinal  muscle  spasm 
often assume unusual postures.

Traumatic  Vertebral  Fractures  Most  traumatic  fractures  of 
the  lumbar  vertebral  bodies  result  from  injuries  producing  anterior 
wedging or compression. With severe trauma, the patient may sustain 
a fracture-dislocation or a “burst” fracture involving the vertebral body 
and  posterior  elements.  Traumatic  vertebral  fractures  are  caused  by 
falls from a height, sudden deceleration in an automobile accident, or 
direct  injury.  Neurologic  impairment  is  common,  and  early  surgical 
treatment  is  indicated.  In  victims  of  blunt  trauma,  CT  scans  of  the 
chest, abdomen, or pelvis can be reformatted to detect associated ver-
tebral fractures. Rules have been developed to avoid unnecessary spine 
imaging  associated  with  low-risk  trauma,  but  these  studies  typically 
exclude  patients  aged  >65  years—a  group  that  can  sustain  fractures 
with minor trauma.

 ■ METABOLIC CAUSES
Osteoporosis  and  Osteosclerosis 
Immobilization,  osteomal-
acia,  the  postmenopausal  state,  renal  disease,  multiple  myeloma, 
hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, metastatic carcinoma, or glu-
cocorticoid use may accelerate osteoporosis and weaken the vertebral 
body, leading to compression fractures and pain. Up to two-thirds of 
compression  fractures  seen  on  radiologic  imaging  are  asymptomatic. 
The most common nontraumatic vertebral body fractures are due to 
a  postmenopausal  cause,  or  to  osteoporosis  in  adults  >75  years  old 
(Chap.  411).  The  risk  of  an  additional  vertebral  fracture  1  year  fol-
lowing a first vertebral fracture is 20%. The presence of fever, weight 
loss, fracture at a level above T4, any fracture in a young adult, or the 
predisposing  conditions  described  above  should  increase  suspicion 
for  a  cause  other  than  typical  osteoporosis.  The  sole  manifestations 
of  a  compression  fracture  may  be  localized  back  or  radicular  pain 
exacerbated by movement and often reproduced by palpation over the 
spinous process of the affected vertebra.

Relief  of  acute  pain  can  often  be  achieved  with  acetaminophen, 
NSAIDs,  opioids,  or  a  combination  of  these  medications.  Both  pain 
and  disability  are  improved  with  bracing.  Antiresorptive  drugs  are 
not  recommended  in  the  setting  of  acute  pain  but  are  the  preferred 
treatment  to  prevent  additional  fractures.  Less  than  one-third  of 
patients  with  prior  compression  fractures  are  adequately  treated  for 
osteoporosis despite the increased risk for future fractures; even fewer 
at-risk patients without a history of fracture are adequately treated. The 
literature  for  percutaneous  vertebroplasty  (PVP)  or  kyphoplasty  for 
osteoporotic  compression  fractures  associated  with  debilitating  pain 
does not support their use.

Osteosclerosis,  an  abnormally  increased  bone  density  often  due 
to  Paget’s  disease,  is  readily  identifiable  on  routine  x-ray  studies  and 
can  sometimes  be  a  source  of  back  pain.  It  may  be  associated  with 
an  isolated  increase  in  alkaline  phosphatase  in  an  otherwise  healthy 
older person. Spinal cord or nerve root compression can result from 
bony encroachment. The diagnosis of Paget’s disease as the cause of a 
patient’s back pain is a diagnosis of exclusion.

For  further  discussion  of  these  bone  disorders,  see  Chaps.  410, 

411, and 412.
 ■ AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS
Autoimmune inflammatory disease of the spine can present with the 
insidious onset of low back, buttock, or neck pain. Examples include 
rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  (Chap.  358),  ankylosing  spondylitis,  reac-
tive  arthritis  and  psoriatic  arthritis  (Chap.  355),  or  inflammatory 
bowel disease (Chap. 326).
 ■ CONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF THE LUMBAR 
SPINE
Spondylolysis  is  a  bony  defect  in  the  vertebral  pars  interarticularis  (a 
segment  near  the  junction  of  the  pedicle  with  the  lamina),  a  find-
ing  present  in  up  to  6%  of  adolescents.  The  cause  is  usually  a  stress 
microfracture in a congenitally abnormal segment. Multislice CT with 
multiplanar  reformation  is  the  most  accurate  modality  for  detecting 
spondylolysis in adults. Symptoms may occur in the setting of a single 
injury, repeated minor injuries, or during a growth spurt. Spondylolysis 
is the most common cause of persistent LBP in adolescents and is often 
associated with sports-related activities.

Scoliosis  refers  to  an  abnormal  curvature  in  the  coronal  (lateral) 
plane of the spine. With kyphoscoliosis, there is, in addition, a forward 
curvature of the spine. The abnormal curvature may be congenital, due 
to abnormal spine development, acquired in adulthood due to degen-
erative spine disease, or progressive due to paraspinal neuromuscular 
disease.  The  deformity  can  progress  until  ambulation  or  pulmonary 
function is compromised.

Spina bifida occulta (closed spinal dysraphism) is a failure of closure 
of one or several vertebral arches posteriorly; the meninges and spinal 
cord are normal. A dimple or small lipoma may overlie the defect, but 
the skin is intact. Most cases are asymptomatic and discovered inciden-
tally during a physical examination for back pain.

Tethered  cord  syndrome  usually  presents  as  a  progressive  cauda 
equina  disorder  (see  below),  although  myelopathy  may  also  be  the 
initial manifestation. The patient is often a child or young adult who 
complains  of  perineal  or  perianal  pain,  sometimes  following  minor 
trauma. MRI studies typically reveal a low-lying conus (below L1 and 
L2) and a short and thickened filum terminale. The MRI findings also 
occur as incidental findings, sometimes during evaluation of unrelated 
LBP in adults.

 ■ REFERRED PAIN FROM VISCERAL DISEASE
Diseases of the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis may refer pain to the spinal 
segment  that  innervates  the  diseased  organ.  Occasionally,  back  pain 
may  be  the  first  and  only  manifestation.  Upper  abdominal  diseases 
generally  refer  pain  to  the  lower  thoracic  or  upper  lumbar  region 
(eighth  thoracic  to  the  first  and  second  lumbar  vertebrae),  lower 
abdominal diseases to the midlumbar region (second to fourth lumbar 
vertebrae), and pelvic diseases to the sacral region. Local signs (pain 
with spine palpation, paraspinal muscle spasm) are absent, and little or 
no pain accompanies routine movements.

Low Thoracic or Lumbar Pain with Abdominal Disease  Tumors 
of  the  posterior  wall  of  the  stomach  or  duodenum  typically  produce 
epigastric pain (Chaps. 80 and  324), but back pain may occur if retro-
peritoneal extension is present. Fatty foods occasionally induce back pain 
associated with biliary or pancreatic disease. Pathology in retroperitoneal 
structures (hemorrhage, tumors, and pyelonephritis) can produce paraspi-
nal pain that radiates to the lower abdomen, groin, or anterior thighs. A 
mass in the iliopsoas region can produce unilateral lumbar pain with radi-
ation toward the groin, labia, or testicle. The sudden appearance of lumbar 

pain in a patient receiving anticoagulants should prompt consideration of 
retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

Isolated  LBP  occurs  in  some  patients  with  a  contained  rupture  of 
an AAA. The classic clinical triad of abdominal pain, shock, and back 
pain occurs in <20% of patients. The diagnosis may be missed because 
the  symptoms  and  signs  can  be  nonspecific.  Misdiagnoses  include 
nonspecific  back  pain,  diverticulitis,  renal  colic,  sepsis,  and  myocar-
dial infarction. A careful abdominal examination revealing a pulsatile 
mass (present in 50–75% of patients) is an important physical finding. 
Patients  with  suspected  AAA  should  be  evaluated  with  abdominal 
ultrasound, CT, or MRI (Chap. 280).

Sacral  Pain  with  Gynecologic  and  Urologic  Disease  Pelvic 
organs  rarely  cause  isolated  LBP.  Uterine  malposition  (retroversion, 
descensus, and prolapse) may cause traction on the uterosacral ligament. 
The  pain  is  referred  to  the  sacral  region,  sometimes  appearing  after 
prolonged  standing.  Endometriosis  or  uterine  cancers  can  invade  the 
uterosacral  ligaments.  Pain  associated  with  endometriosis  is  typically 
premenstrual and often continues until it merges with menstrual pain.

Menstrual  pain  with  poorly  localized,  cramping  pain  can  radiate 
down the legs. LBP that radiates into one or both thighs is common 
in the last weeks of pregnancy. Continuous and worsening pain unre-
lieved by rest or at night may be due to neoplastic infiltration of nerves 
or nerve roots.

Urologic sources of lumbosacral back pain include chronic prosta-
titis, prostate cancer with spinal metastasis (Chap. 87), and diseases of 
the kidney or ureter. Infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic renal dis-
eases may produce ipsilateral lumbosacral pain, as can renal artery or 
vein thrombosis. Paraspinal lumbar pain may be a symptom of ureteral 
obstruction due to nephrolithiasis.

 ■ OTHER CAUSES OF BACK PAIN
Postural Back Pain  There is a group of patients with nonspecific 
chronic low back pain (CLBP) in whom no specific anatomic lesion can 
be found despite exhaustive investigation. Exercises to strengthen the 
paraspinal and abdominal muscles are sometimes helpful. CLBP may 
be encountered in patients who seek financial compensation; in malin-
gerers;  or  in  those  with  concurrent  substance  abuse.  Many  patients 
with  CLBP  have  a  history  of  psychiatric  illness  (depression,  anxiety 
states) or childhood trauma (physical or sexual abuse) that antedates 
the onset of back pain. Preoperative psychological assessment has been 
used to exclude patients with marked psychological impairments that 
predict a poor surgical outcome from spine surgery.

Idiopathic  The  cause  of  LBP  occasionally  remains  unclear.  Some 
patients  have  had  multiple  operations  for  disk  disease.  The  original 
indications  for  surgery  may  have  been  questionable,  with  back  pain 
only, no definite neurologic signs, or a minor disk bulge noted on CT 
or  MRI.  Scoring  systems  based  on  neurologic  signs,  psychological 
factors, physiologic studies, and imaging studies have been devised to 
minimize the likelihood of unsuccessful surgery.
 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
While many of the history and examination features described in this 
chapter apply to all patients, information regarding the global epidemi-
ology and prevalence of LBP is limited. The Global Burden of Diseases 
Study 2019 reported that LBP represented the #1 cause overall for total 
years lived with disability (YLD), and #9 overall as a cause of disability- 
related life years (DALYs). These numbers increased substantially from 
1990  estimates,  and  with  the  aging  of  the  population  worldwide,  the 
numbers  of  individuals  suffering  from  LBP  are  expected  to  increase 
further in the future. Although rankings for LBP generally were higher 
in developed regions, a high burden exists in every part of the world. 
An area of uncertainty is the degree to which regional differences exist 
in terms of the specific etiologies of LBP and how these are managed. 
For example, the most common cause of arachnoiditis in developing 
countries  is  a  prior  spinal  infection,  but  in  developed  countries  the 
most frequent cause is multiple lumbar spine surgeries.

back pain syndromes without radiculopathy, and for back pain with 
radiculopathy. 
ACUTE LOW BACK PAIN WITHOUT RADICULOPATHY
This  is  defined  as  pain  of  <12  weeks  duration.  Full  recovery  can 
be expected in >85% of adults with ALBP without leg pain. Most 
have purely “mechanical” symptoms (i.e., pain that is aggravated by 
motion and relieved by rest).

The  initial  assessment  is  focused  on  excluding  serious  causes 
of  spine  pathology  that  require  urgent  intervention,  including 
infection,  cancer,  or  trauma.  Risk  factors  for  a  serious  cause  of 
ALBP are shown in Table 17-1. Laboratory and imaging studies are 
unnecessary if risk factors are absent. CT, MRI, or plain spine films 
are rarely indicated in the first month of symptoms unless a spine 
fracture, tumor, or infection is suspected.

The prognosis of ALBP is generally excellent; however, episodes 
tend to recur, and as many as two-thirds of patients will experience 
a second episode within 1 year. Most patients do not seek medical 
care and improve on their own. Even among those seen in primary 
care, two-thirds report substantial improvement after 7 weeks. This 
high likelihood of spontaneous improvement can mislead clinicians 
and  patients  about  the  efficacy  of  treatment  interventions,  high-
lighting the importance of rigorous prospective trials. Many treat-
ments commonly used in the past are now known to be ineffective, 
including bed rest and lumbar traction.

Clinicians  should  reassure  and  educate  patients  that  improve-
ment is very likely and instruct them in self-care. Satisfaction and 
the  likelihood  of  follow-up  increase  when  patients  are  educated 
about  prognosis,  evidence-based  treatments,  appropriate  activ-
ity  modifications,  and  strategies  to  prevent  future  exacerbations. 
Counseling  patients  about  the  risks  of  overtreatment  is  another 
important part of the discussion. Patients who report that they did 
not receive an adequate explanation for their symptoms are likely to 
request further diagnostic tests.

In general, bed rest should be avoided for relief of severe symp-
toms or limited to a day or two at most. Several randomized trials 
suggest that bed rest does not hasten the pace of recovery. In gen-
eral,  early  resumption  of  normal  daily  physical  activity  should  be 
encouraged, avoiding only strenuous manual labor. Advantages of 
early ambulation for ALBP also include maintenance of cardiovas-
cular conditioning; improved bone, cartilage, and muscle strength; 
and increased endorphin levels. Specific back exercises or early vig-
orous exercise have not shown benefits for acute back pain. Empiric 
use of heating pads or blankets is sometimes helpful. 
NSAIDs  and  Acetaminophen  Evidence-based  guidelines  recom-
mend over-the-counter medicines such as NSAIDs and acetamin-
ophen  as  first-line  options  for  treatment  of  ALBP.  In  otherwise 
healthy  patients,  a  trial  of  NSAIDs  can  be  followed  by  acetamin-
ophen  for  time-limited  periods.  In  theory,  the  anti-inflammatory 
effects of NSAIDs might provide an advantage over acetaminophen 
to suppress inflammation that accompanies many causes of ALBP, 
but in practice there is no clinical evidence to support the superi-
ority of NSAIDs. The risk of renal and gastrointestinal toxicity with 
NSAIDs  is  increased  in  patients  with  preexisting  medical  comor-
bidities  (e.g.,  renal  insufficiency,  cirrhosis,  prior  gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage, use of anticoagulants or glucocorticoids, heart failure). 
Some patients elect to take acetaminophen and an NSAID together 
in hopes of a more rapid benefit. 
Muscle  Relaxants  Skeletal  muscle  relaxants,  such  as  cycloben-
zaprine or methocarbamol, may be useful, but sedation is a com-
mon side effect. Limiting the use of muscle relaxants to nighttime 
only  may  be  an  option  for  patients  with  back  pain  that  interferes 
with sleep.

Opioids  There is no good evidence to support the use of opioid 
analgesics or tramadol as first-line therapy for ALBP. Their use is 
best  reserved  for  patients  who  cannot  tolerate  acetaminophen  or 
NSAIDs and for those with severe refractory pain. Also, the duration 
of opioid treatment for ALBP should be strictly limited to 3–7 days. 
As with muscle relaxants, these drugs are often sedating, so it may 
be useful to prescribe them at nighttime only. Side effects of short-
term  opioid  use  include  nausea,  constipation,  and  pruritus;  risks 
of long-term opioid use include hypersensitivity to pain, hypogo-
nadism,  and  dependency.  Falls,  fractures,  driving  accidents,  and 
fecal impaction are other risks. The clinical efficacy of opioids for 
chronic pain beyond 16 weeks of use is unproven.

Mounting evidence of morbidity from long-term opioid therapy 
(including  overdose,  dependency,  addiction,  falls,  fractures,  acci-
dent risk, and sexual dysfunction) has prompted efforts to reduce its 
use for chronic pain, including back pain (Chap. 13). When used, 
safety  may  be  improved  with  automated  notices  for  high  doses, 
early  refills,  prescriptions  from  multiple  pharmacies,  overlapping 
opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions, and in the United States 
by  state-based  prescription  drug  monitoring  programs  (PDMPs). 
A  recent  study  indicated  that  most  patients  with  opioid  use  dis-
order  presenting  to  emergency  departments  had  no  prescriptions 
recorded  in  the  PDMP,  reflecting  other  methods  used  to  obtain 
opioids.  Greater  access  to  alternative  treatments  for  chronic  pain, 
such as tailored exercise programs and cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT), may also reduce opioid prescribing. 

Other Approaches  There is no evidence to support use of oral or 
injected  glucocorticoids,  antiepileptics,  antidepressants,  or  thera-
pies  for  neuropathic  pain  such  as  gabapentin  or  herbal  therapies. 
Commonly used nonpharmacologic treatments for ALBP are also 
of unproven benefit, including spinal manipulation, physical ther-
apy,  massage,  acupuncture,  laser  therapy,  therapeutic  ultrasound, 
corsets, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), special 
mattresses,  or  lumbar  traction.  Although  important  for  chronic 
pain,  use  of  back  exercises  for  ALBP  are  generally  not  supported 
by clinical evidence. There is no convincing evidence regarding the 
value of ice or heat applications for ABLP; however, many patients 
report temporary symptomatic relief from ice or frozen gel packs 
just before sleep, and heat may produce a short-term reduction in 
pain after the first week. Patients often report improved satisfaction 
with the care that they receive when they actively participate in the 
selection of symptomatic approaches. 

CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WITHOUT RADICULOPATHY
Back pain is considered chronic when the symptoms last >12 weeks; it 
accounts for 50% of total back pain costs. Risk factors include obe-
sity, female gender, older age, prior history of back pain, restricted 
spinal  mobility,  pain  radiating  into  a  leg,  high  levels  of  psycho-
logical  distress,  poor  self-rated  health,  minimal  physical  activity, 
smoking, job dissatisfaction, and widespread pain. In general, the 
same treatments that are recommended for ALBP can be useful for 
patients with CLBP. In this setting, however, the benefit of opioid 
therapy or muscle relaxants is less clear. In general, improved activ-
ity tolerance is the primary goal, while pain relief is secondary.

Some  observers  have  raised  concerns  that  CLBP  may  often  be 
overtreated.  For  CLBP  without  radiculopathy,  multiple  guidelines 
explicitly  recommend  against  use  of  SSRIs,  any  type  of  injection, 
TENS,  lumbar  supports,  traction,  radiofrequency  facet  joint  den-
ervation,  intradiskal  electrothermal  therapy,  or  intradiskal  radio-
frequency thermocoagulation. On the other hand, exercise therapy 
and treatment of depression appear to be useful and underused. 

Exercise Programs  Evidence supports the use of exercise therapy 
to alleviate pain symptoms and improve function. Exercise can be 
one of the mainstays of treatment for CLBP. Effective regimens have 
generally  included  a  combination  of  core-strengthening  exercises, 
stretching, and gradually increasing aerobic exercise. A program of 
supervised exercise can improve compliance. Supervised intensive

physical exercise or “work hardening” regimens have been effective 
in  returning  some  patients  to  work,  improving  walking  distance, 
and  reducing  pain.  In  addition,  some  forms  of  yoga  have  been 
evaluated in randomized trials and may be helpful for patients who 
are interested.

Intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs can include 
daily or frequent physical therapy, exercise, CBT, a workplace evalu-
ation, and other interventions. For patients who have not responded 
to other approaches, such programs appear to offer some benefit. 
Systematic reviews, however, suggest that the evidence and benefits 
are limited. 
Nonopioid Medications  Medications for CLBP may include short 
courses of NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Duloxetine is approved for 
the treatment of CLBP (60 mg daily) and may also treat coincident 
depression. Tricyclic antidepressants can provide modest pain relief 
for  some  patients  without  evidence  of  depression.  Depression  is 
common among patients with chronic pain and should be appro-
priately treated. 
Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy  CBT  is  based  on  evidence  that 
psychological and social factors, as well as somatic pathology, are 
important in the genesis of chronic pain and disability; CBT focuses 
on efforts to identify and modify patients’ thinking about their con-
dition. In one randomized trial, CBT reduced disability and pain in 
patients with CLBP. Such behavioral treatments appear to provide 
benefits similar in magnitude to exercise therapy. 
Complementary  Medicine  Back  pain  is  the  most  frequent  rea-
son for seeking complementary and alternative treatments. Spinal 
manipulation or massage therapy may provide short-term relief, but 
long-term  benefit  is  unproven.  Biofeedback  has  not  been  studied 
rigorously. There is no convincing evidence that either TENS, laser 
therapy, or ultrasound are effective in treating CLBP. Rigorous tri-
als of acupuncture suggest that true acupuncture is not superior to 
sham acupuncture, but that both may offer an advantage over rou-
tine care. Whether this is due entirely to placebo effects provided 
even by sham acupuncture is uncertain. 
Injections  and  Other  Interventions  Various  injections,  including 
epidural glucocorticoid injections, facet joint injections, and trigger 
point  injections,  have  been  used  for  treating  CLBP.  However,  in 
the absence of radiculopathy, there is no clear evidence that these 
approaches are sustainably effective.

Injection studies are sometimes used diagnostically to help deter-
mine the anatomic source of back pain. Pain relief following a gluco-
corticoid and anesthetic injection into a facet or medial branch block 
are used as evidence that the facet joint is the pain source; however, 
the possibility that the response was a placebo effect or due to sys-
temic absorption of the glucocorticoids is difficult to exclude.

Another  category  of  intervention  for  CLBP  is  electrothermal 
and radiofrequency therapy. Intradiskal therapy has been proposed 
using energy to thermocoagulate and destroy nerves in the inter-
vertebral  disk,  using  specially  designed  catheters  or  electrodes. 
Current  evidence  does  not  support  the  use  of  discography  to 
identify a specific disk as the pain source, or the use of intradiskal 
electrothermal or radiofrequency therapy for CLBP.

Radiofrequency denervation is sometimes used to destroy nerves 
that are thought to mediate pain, and this technique has been used 
for facet joint pain (with the target nerve being the medial branch 
of the primary dorsal ramus), for back pain thought to arise from 
the  intervertebral  disk  (ramus  communicans),  and  radicular  back 
pain (dorsal root ganglia). These interventional therapies have not 
been studied in sufficient detail to draw firm conclusions regarding 
their value for CLBP. 
Surgery  Surgical  intervention  for  CLBP  without  radiculopathy 
has  been  evaluated  in  a  number  of  randomized  trials.  The  case 
for fusion surgery for CLBP without radiculopathy is weak. While 
some studies have shown modest benefit, there has been no benefit 
when compared to an active medical treatment arm, often including 
highly structured, rigorous rehabilitation combined with CBT. The 

use of bone matrix protein (BMP) instead of iliac crest graft for the 
fusion was shown to increase hospital costs and length of stay but 
not improve clinical outcomes.

Guidelines suggest that referral for an opinion on spinal fusion 
can  be  considered  for  patients  who  have  completed  an  optimal 
nonsurgical treatment program (including combined physical and 
psychological treatment) and who have persistent severe back pain 
for  which  they  would  consider  surgery.  The  high  cost,  wide  geo-
graphic variations, and rapidly increasing rates of spinal fusion sur-
gery have prompted scrutiny regarding the lack of standardization 
of appropriate indications. Some insurance carriers have begun to 
limit coverage for the most controversial indications, such as LBP 
without radiculopathy.

Lumbar  disk  replacement  with  prosthetic  disks  is  US  Food  and 
Drug  Administration–approved  for  uncomplicated  patients  need-
ing  single-level  surgery  at  the  L3-S1  levels.  The  disks  are  generally 
designed  as  metal  plates  with  a  polyethylene  cushion  sandwiched 
in between. The trials that led to approval of these devices were not 
blinded.  When  compared  to  spinal  fusion,  the  artificial  disks  were 
“not inferior.” Long-term follow-up is needed to determine device fail-
ure rates over time. Serious complications are somewhat more likely 
with the artificial disk. This treatment remains controversial for CLBP. 

LOW BACK PAIN WITH RADICULOPATHY
A  common  cause  of  back  pain  with  radiculopathy  is  a  herniated 
disk  affecting  the  nerve  root  and  producing  back  pain  with  radi-
ation  down  the  leg.  The  term  sciatica  is  used  when  the  leg  pain 
radiates posteriorly in a sciatic or L5/S1 distribution. The prognosis 
for  acute  low  back  and  leg  pain  with  radiculopathy  due  to  disk 
herniation is generally favorable, with most patients showing sub-
stantial improvement over months. Serial imaging studies suggest 
spontaneous regression of the herniated portion of the disk in two-
thirds  of  patients  over  6  months.  Nonetheless,  several  important 
treatment  options  provide  symptomatic  relief  while  the  healing 
process unfolds.

Resumption  of  normal  activity  is  recommended.  Randomized 
trial evidence suggests that bed rest is ineffective for treating sciat-
ica as well as back pain alone. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are use-
ful for pain relief, although severe pain may require short courses 
(3–7 days) of opioid analgesics. Opioids are superior for acute pain 
relief in the emergency department.

Epidural glucocorticoid injections have a role in providing symp-
tom relief for acute lumbar radiculopathy due to a herniated disk, 
but  do  not  reduce  the  use  of  subsequent  surgical  intervention.  A 
brief course of high-dose oral glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 
dose pack) for 3 days followed by a rapid taper over 4 more days can 
be helpful for some patients with acute disk-related radiculopathy, 
although this specific regimen has not been studied rigorously.

Diagnostic nerve root blocks have been advocated to determine 
if pain originates from a specific nerve root. However, improvement 
may result even when the nerve root is not responsible for the pain; 
this  may  occur  as  a  placebo  effect,  from  a  pain-generating  lesion 
located distally along the peripheral nerve, or from effects of sys-
temic absorption.

Urgent surgery is recommended for patients who have evidence 
of CES or spinal cord compression, generally manifesting as com-
binations of bowel or bladder dysfunction, diminished sensation in 
a saddle distribution, a sensory level on the trunk, and bilateral leg 
weakness  or  spasticity.  Surgical  intervention  is  also  indicated  for 
patients with progressive motor weakness due to nerve root injury 
demonstrated on clinical examination or EMG.

Surgery  is  also  an  important  option  for  patients  who  have 
disabling  radicular  pain  despite  optimal  conservative  treatment. 
Because patients with a herniated disk and sciatica generally expe-
rience rapid improvement over weeks, most experts do not recom-
mend considering surgery unless the patient has failed to respond to 
a minimum of 6–8 weeks of nonsurgical management. For patients 
who have not improved, randomized trials show that surgery results 
in more rapid pain relief than nonsurgical treatment. However, after

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases2 years of follow-up, patients appear to have similar pain relief and 
functional improvement with or without surgery. Thus, both treat-
ment approaches are reasonable, and patient preferences and needs 
(e.g.,  rapid  return  to  employment)  strongly  influence  decision-
making. Some patients will want the fastest possible relief and find 
surgical risks acceptable. Others will be more risk-averse and more 
tolerant of symptoms and will choose watchful waiting, especially if 
they understand that improvement is likely in the end.

The usual surgical procedure is a partial hemilaminectomy with 
excision  of  the  prolapsed  disk  (diskectomy).  Minimally  invasive 
techniques  have  gained  in  popularity  in  recent  years,  but  some 
evidence suggests they may be less effective than standard surgical 
techniques, with more residual back pain, leg pain, and higher rates 
of rehospitalization. Fusion of the involved lumbar segments should 
be  considered  only  if  significant  spinal  instability  is  present  (i.e., 
degenerative  spondylolisthesis).  The  costs  associated  with  lumbar 
interbody fusion have increased dramatically in recent years. There 
are  no  large  prospective,  randomized  trials  comparing  fusion  to 
other  types  of  surgical  intervention.  In  one  study,  patients  with 
persistent  LBP  despite  an  initial  diskectomy  fared  no  better  with 
spine  fusion  than  with  a  conservative  regimen  of  cognitive  inter-
vention and exercise. Artificial disks, as discussed above, are used 
in Europe; their utility remains controversial in the United States.

PAIN IN THE NECK AND SHOULDER
Neck pain, which usually arises from diseases of the cervical spine and 
soft  tissues  of  the  neck,  is  common,  typically  precipitated  by  move-
ment,  and  may  be  accompanied  by  focal  tenderness  and  limitation 
of  motion.  Many  of  the  earlier  comments  made  regarding  causes  of 
LBP also apply to disorders of the cervical spine. The text below will 
emphasize differences. Pain arising from the brachial plexus, shoulder, 
or  peripheral  nerves  can  be  confused  with  cervical  spine  disease 
(Table  17-4),  but  the  history  and  examination  usually  identify  a 
more distal origin for the pain. When the site of nerve tissue injury is 
unclear,  EMG  studies  can  localize  the  lesion.  Cervical  spine  trauma, 
disk  disease,  or  spondylosis  with  intervertebral  foraminal  narrowing 
may be asymptomatic or painful and can produce a myelopathy, radic-
ulopathy, or both. The same risk factors for serious causes of LBP also 
apply to neck pain with the additional feature that neurologic signs of 
myelopathy (incontinence, sensory level, spastic legs) may also occur. 
Lhermitte’s sign, an electrical shock down the spine with neck flexion, 
suggests involvement of the cervical spinal cord.

 ■ TRAUMA TO THE CERVICAL SPINE
Trauma (fractures, subluxation) places the spinal cord at risk for com-
pression. Motor vehicle accidents, violent crimes, or falls account for 
87% of cervical spinal cord injuries (Chap. 442). Immediate immobi-
lization of the neck is essential to minimize further spinal cord injury 
from movement of unstable cervical spine segments. A CT scan is the 
diagnostic procedure of choice for detection of acute fractures follow-
ing severe trauma; plain x-rays are used for lesser degrees of trauma 
or in settings where CT is unavailable. When traumatic injury to the 
vertebral arteries or cervical spinal cord is suspected, visualization by 
MRI with magnetic resonance angiography is preferred.

The  decision  to  obtain  imaging  should  be  based  on  the  clinical 
context of the injury. The National Emergency X-Radiography Utiliza-
tion  Study  (NEXUS)  low-risk  criteria  established  that  normally  alert 
patients  without  palpation  tenderness  in  the  midline;  intoxication; 
neurologic deficits; or painful distracting injuries were very unlikely to 
have sustained a clinically significant traumatic injury to the cervical 
spine.  The  Canadian  C-spine  rule  recommends  that  imaging  should 
be  obtained  following  neck  region  trauma  if  the  patient  is  >65  years 
old  or  has  limb  paresthesias  or  if  there  was  a  dangerous  mechanism 
for the injury (e.g., bicycle collision with tree or parked car, fall from 
height >3 ft or five stairs, diving accident). These guidelines are helpful 
but must be tailored to individual circumstances; for example, patients 
with advanced osteoporosis, glucocorticoid use, or cancer may warrant 
imaging after even mild trauma.

Whiplash injury is due to rapid flexion and extension of the neck, 
usually  from  automobile  accidents.  The  likely  mechanism  involves 
injury  to  the  facet  joints.  This  diagnosis  should  not  be  applied  to 
patients with fractures, disk herniation, head injury, focal neurologic 
findings,  or  altered  consciousness.  Up  to  50%  of  persons  reporting 
whiplash  injury  acutely  have  persistent  neck  pain  1  year  later.  When 
personal compensation for pain and suffering was removed from the 
Australian  health  care  system,  the  prognosis  for  recovery  at  1  year 
improved. Imaging of the cervical spine is not cost-effective acutely but 
is useful to detect disk herniations when symptoms persist for >6 weeks 
following the injury. Severe initial symptoms have been associated with 
a poor long-term outcome.
 ■ CERVICAL DISK DISEASE
Degenerative cervical disk disease is very common and usually asymp-
tomatic. Herniation of a lower cervical disk is a common cause of pain 
or  tingling  in  the  neck,  shoulder,  arm,  or  hand.  Neck  pain,  stiffness, 
and  a  range  of  motion  limited  by  pain  are  the  usual  manifestations.

128 Herniated cervical disks are responsible for ~25% of cervical radicu-
lopathies. Extension and lateral rotation of the neck narrow the ipsi-
lateral intervertebral foramen and may reproduce radicular symptoms 
(Spurling’s sign). In young adults, acute nerve root compression from 
a ruptured cervical disk is often due to trauma. Cervical disk hernia-
tions are usually posterolateral near the lateral recess. Typical patterns 
of  reflex,  sensory,  and  motor  changes  that  accompany  cervical  nerve 
root lesions are summarized in Table 17-4. Although the classic pat-
terns are clinically helpful, there are numerous exceptions because (1) 
there is overlap in sensory function between adjacent nerve roots, (2) 
symptoms and signs may be evident in only part of the injured nerve 
root territory, and (3) the location of pain is the most variable of the 
clinical features.

 ■ CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS
Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine may produce neck pain that radiates 
into the back of the head, shoulders, or arms, or may be the source of 
headaches  in  the  posterior  occipital  region  (supplied  by  the  C2-C4 
nerve  roots).  Osteophytes,  disk  protrusions,  or  hypertrophic  facet  or 
uncovertebral  joints  may  alone  or  in  combination  compress  one  or 
several nerve roots at the intervertebral foramina; these causes together 
account for 75% of cervical radiculopathies. The roots most commonly 
affected are C7 and C6. Narrowing of the spinal canal by osteophytes, 
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), or a large 
central disk may compress the cervical spinal cord and produce signs 
of  myelopathy  alone  or  radiculopathy  with  myelopathy  (myeloradic-
ulopathy).  When  little  or  no  neck  pain  accompanies  cervical  cord 
involvement,  other  diagnoses  to  be  considered  include  amyotrophic 
lateral  sclerosis  (Chap.  437),  multiple  sclerosis  (Chap.  444),  spinal 
cord  tumors,  or  syringomyelia  (Chap.  442).  Cervical  spondylotic 
myelopathy  should  be  considered  even  when  the  patient  presents 
with symptoms or spinal cord signs in the legs only. MRI is the study 
of  choice  to  define  soft  tissues  in  the  cervical  region  including  the 
spinal  cord,  whereas  plain  CT  is  optimal  to  identify  bone  pathology 
including foraminal, lateral recess, OPLL, or spinal canal stenosis. In 
spondylotic  myelopathy,  focal  enhancement  by  MRI,  sometimes  in  a 
characteristic “pancake pattern,” may be present at the site of maximal 
cord compression.

There  is  no  evidence  to  support  prophylactic  surgery  for  asymp-
tomatic cervical spinal stenosis unaccompanied by myelopathic signs 
or  abnormal  spinal  cord  findings  on  MRI,  except  in  the  setting  of 
dynamic  instability  (see  spondylolisthesis  above).  If  the  patient  has 
postural  neck  pain,  a  prior  history  of  whiplash  or  other  spine/head 
injury, a Lhermitte sign, or preexisting listhesis at the stenotic segment 
on cervical MRI or CT, then cervical spine flexion-extension x-rays or 
MRI are indicated to look for dynamic instability. Surgical intervention 
is not recommended for patients with listhesis alone, unaccompanied 
by dynamic instability.

 ■ OTHER CAUSES OF NECK PAIN
Rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  (Chap.  358)  of  the  cervical  facet  joints 
produces  neck  pain,  stiffness,  and  limitation  of  motion.  Synovitis  of 
the  atlantoaxial  joint  (C1-C2;  Fig.  17-2)  may  damage  the  transverse 
ligament of the atlas, producing forward displacement of the atlas on 
the axis (atlantoaxial subluxation). Radiologic evidence of atlantoaxial 
subluxation occurs in up to 30% of patients with RA and plain x-ray 
films  of  the  neck  should  be  routinely  performed  preoperatively  to 
assess  the  risk  of  neck  hyperextension  in  patients  requiring  intuba-
tion. The degree of subluxation correlates with the severity of erosive 
disease. When subluxation is present, careful assessment is important 
to  identify  early  signs  of  myelopathy  that  could  be  a  harbinger  of 
life-threatening spinal cord compression. Surgery should be considered 
when  myelopathy  or  spinal  instability  is  present.  Ankylosing  spon-
dylitis  is  another  cause  of  neck  pain  and  less  commonly  atlantoaxial 
subluxation.

Acute herpes zoster can present as acute posterior occipital or neck 
pain  prior  to  the  outbreak  of  vesicles.  Neoplasms  metastatic  to  the 
cervical  spine,  infections  (osteomyelitis  and  epidural  abscess),  and 
metabolic  bone  diseases  may  be  the  cause  of  neck  pain,  as  discussed 

above. Neck pain may also be referred from the heart with coronary 
artery  ischemia  (cervical  angina  syndrome).  Rheumatologic  disease 
should be considered if the neck pain is accompanied by shoulder or 
hip girdle pain.

 ■ THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROMES
The  thoracic  outlet  contains  the  first  rib,  the  subclavian  artery  and 
vein, the brachial plexus, the clavicle, and the lung apex. Injury to these 
structures  may  result  in  postural  or  movement-induced  pain  around 
the shoulder and supraclavicular region, classified as follows.

True  neurogenic  thoracic  outlet  syndrome  (TOS)  is  an  uncommon 
disorder resulting from compression of the lower trunk of the brachial 
plexus or ventral rami of the C8 or T1 nerve roots, caused most often 
by an anomalous band of cartilaginous tissue connecting an elongate 
transverse  process  at  C7  with  the  first  rib.  Pain  is  mild  or  may  be 
absent. Signs include weakness and wasting of intrinsic muscles of the 
hand and diminished sensation on the palmar aspect of the fifth digit. 
An anteroposterior cervical spine x-ray will show an elongate C7 trans-
verse  process  (an  anatomic  marker  for  the  anomalous  cartilaginous 
band), and EMG and NCSs confirm the diagnosis. Treatment consists 
of surgical resection of the anomalous band. The weakness and wasting 
of intrinsic hand muscles typically do not improve, but surgery halts 
the insidious progression of weakness.

Arterial TOS results from compression of the subclavian artery by 
a cervical rib, resulting in poststenotic dilatation of the artery and in 
some cases secondary thrombus formation. Blood pressure is reduced 
in the affected limb, and signs of emboli may be present in the hand. 
Neurologic  signs  are  absent.  Ultrasound  can  confirm  the  diagnosis 
noninvasively. Treatment is with thrombolysis or anticoagulation (with 
or without embolectomy) and surgical excision of the cervical rib com-
pressing the subclavian artery.

Venous TOS is due to subclavian vein thrombosis resulting in swell-
ing  of  the  arm  and  pain.  The  vein  may  be  compressed  by  a  cervical 
rib or anomalous scalene muscle. Venography is the diagnostic test of 
choice.

Disputed  TOS  accounts  for  95%  of  patients  diagnosed  with  TOS; 
chronic  arm  and  shoulder  pain  are  prominent  and  of  unclear  cause. 
The lack of sensitive and specific findings on physical examination or 
specific  markers  for  this  condition  results  in  diagnostic  uncertainty. 
The role of surgery in disputed TOS is controversial. Major depression, 
chronic  symptoms,  work-related  injury,  and  diffuse  arm  symptoms 
predict  poor  surgical  outcomes.  Multidisciplinary  pain  management 
is a conservative approach, although treatment is often unsuccessful.

 ■ BRACHIAL PLEXUS AND NERVES
Pain from injury to the brachial plexus or peripheral nerves of the arm 
can occasionally mimic referred pain of cervical spine origin, includ-
ing  cervical  radiculopathy,  but  the  pain  typically  begins  distal  to  the 
posterior neck region in the shoulder girdle or upper arm. Neoplastic 
infiltration  of  the  lower  trunk  of  the  brachial  plexus  may  produce 
shoulder  or  supraclavicular  pain  radiating  down  the  arm,  numbness 
of  the  fourth  and  fifth  fingers  or  medial  forearm,  and  weakness  of 
intrinsic  hand  muscles  innervated  by  the  lower  trunk  and  medial 
cord  of  the  brachial  plexus.  Delayed  radiation  injury  may  produce 
weakness in the upper arm or numbness of the lateral forearm or arm 
due to involvement of the upper trunk and lateral cord of the plexus. 
Pain is less common and less severe than with neoplastic infiltration. 
A Pancoast tumor of the lung (Chap. 78) is another cause and should 
be  considered,  especially  when  a  concurrent  Horner’s  syndrome  is 
present. Acute brachial neuritis is often confused with radiculopathy; 
the acute onset of severe shoulder or scapular pain is followed typically 
over days by weakness of the proximal arm and shoulder girdle muscles 
innervated by the upper brachial plexus. The onset may be preceded 
by  an  infection,  vaccination,  or  minor  surgical  procedure.  The  long 
thoracic nerve may be affected, resulting in a winged scapula. Brachial 
neuritis may also present as an isolated paralysis of the diaphragm with 
or  without  involvement  of  other  nerves  of  the  upper  limb.  Recovery 
may take up to 3 years, and full functional recovery can be expected in 
the majority of patients.

paresthesias  extending  into  the  forearm,  arm,  and  shoulder  resem-
bling a C5 or C6 root lesion. Lesions of the radial or ulnar nerve can 
also  mimic  radiculopathy,  at  C7  or  C8,  respectively.  EMG  and  NCSs 
can  accurately  localize  lesions  to  the  nerve  roots,  brachial  plexus,  or 
peripheral nerves.

For further discussion of peripheral nerve disorders, see Chap. 446.

 ■ SHOULDER
Pain arising from the shoulder can on occasion mimic pain from the 
spine.  If  symptoms  and  signs  of  radiculopathy  are  absent,  then  the 
differential  diagnosis  includes  mechanical  shoulder  pain  (bicipital 
tendonitis, frozen shoulder, bursitis, rotator cuff tear, dislocation, adhe-
sive capsulitis, or rotator cuff impingement under the acromion) and 
referred  pain  (subdiaphragmatic  irritation,  angina,  Pancoast  tumor). 
Mechanical pain is often worse at night, associated with local shoulder 
tenderness  and  aggravated  by  passive  abduction,  internal  rotation, 
or extension of the arm. Demonstrating normal passive full range of 
motion of the arm at the shoulder without worsening the usual pain 
can  help  exclude  mechanical  shoulder  pathology  as  a  cause  of  neck 
region pain. Pain from shoulder disease may radiate into the arm or 
hand,  but  focal  neurologic  signs  (sensory,  motor,  or  reflex  changes) 
are absent.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Many of the considerations described above for LBP also apply to neck 
pain.  The  Global  Burden  of  Diseases  Study  2019  reported  that  neck 
pain  ranked  second  only  to  back  pain  as  a  cause  of  total  years  lived 
with disability (YLD). In general, neck pain rankings were also higher 
in developed regions of the world.

TREATMENT
Neck Pain Without Radiculopathy

The evidence regarding treatment for neck pain is less comprehen-
sive  than  that  for  LBP,  but  the  approach  is  remarkably  similar  in 
many respects. As with LBP, spontaneous improvement is the norm 
for  acute  neck  pain.  The  usual  goals  of  therapy  are  to  promote  a 
rapid return to normal function and provide pain relief while heal-
ing proceeds.

Acute neck pain is often treated with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, 
cold packs, or heat, alone or in combination while awaiting recov-
ery. Patients should be specifically educated regarding the favorable 
natural  history  of  acute  neck  pain  to  avoid  unrealistic  fear  and 
inappropriate requests for imaging and other tests. For patients kept 
awake by symptoms, cyclobenzaprine (5–10 mg) at night can help 
relieve  muscle  spasm  and  promote  drowsiness.  For  patients  with 
neck  pain  unassociated  with  trauma,  supervised  exercise  with  or 
without mobilization appears to be effective. Exercises often include 
shoulder rolls and neck stretches. The evidence in support of non-
surgical  treatments  for  whiplash-associated  disorders  is  generally 
of  limited  quality  and  neither  supports  nor  refutes  the  common 
treatments  used  for  symptom  relief.  Gentle  mobilization  of  the 
cervical spine combined with exercise programs may be beneficial. 
Evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of cervical traction, 
TENS, ultrasound, trigger point injections, botulinum toxin injec-
tions, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs for acute or chronic neck 
pain.  Some  patients  obtain  modest  pain  relief  using  a  soft  neck 
collar;  there  is  little  risk  or  cost.  Massage  can  produce  temporary 
pain relief.

For  patients  with  chronic  neck  pain,  supervised  exercise  pro-
grams can provide symptom relief and improve function. Acupunc-
ture provided short-term benefit for some patients when compared 
to a sham procedure and is an option. Spinal manipulation alone 
has  not  been  shown  to  be  effective  and  carries  a  risk  for  injury. 
Surgical treatment for chronic neck pain without radiculopathy or 
spine instability is not recommended.

Neck Pain With Radiculopathy

The  natural  history  of  acute  neck  pain  with  radiculopathy  due  to 
disk  disease  is  favorable,  and  many  patients  will  improve  with-
out  specific  therapy.  Although  there  are  no  randomized  trials  of 
NSAIDs  for  neck  pain,  a  course  of  NSAIDs,  acetaminophen,  or 
both, with or without muscle relaxants, and avoidance of activities 
that  trigger  symptoms  are  reasonable  as  initial  therapy.  Gentle 
supervised  exercise  and  avoidance  of  inactivity  are  reasonable  as 
well. A short course of high-dose oral glucocorticoids with a rapid 
taper,  or  epidural  steroids  administered  under  imaging  guidance 
can be effective for acute or subacute disk-related cervical radicular 
pain,  but  have  not  been  subjected  to  rigorous  trials.  The  risk  of 
injection-related complications is higher in the neck than the low 
back; vertebral artery dissection, dural puncture, spinal cord injury, 
and embolism in the vertebral arteries have all been reported. Opi-
oid  analgesics  can  be  used  in  the  emergency  department  and  for 
short courses as an outpatient. Soft cervical collars can be modestly 
helpful  by  limiting  spontaneous  and  reflex  neck  movements  that 
exacerbate pain; hard collars are in general poorly tolerated.

If cervical radiculopathy is due to bony compression from cer-
vical spondylosis with foraminal narrowing, periodic follow-up to 
assess  for  progression  is  indicated  and  consideration  of  surgical 
decompression is reasonable. Surgical treatment can produce rapid 
pain relief, although it is unclear if long-term functional outcomes 
are  improved  over  nonsurgical  therapy.  Indications  for  cervical 
disk surgery include a progressive motor deficit due to nerve root 
compression,  functionally  limiting  pain  that  fails  to  respond  to 
conservative  management,  or  spinal  cord  compression.  In  other 
circumstances, clinical improvement over time regardless of thera-
peutic intervention is common.

Surgical  treatments  include  anterior  cervical  diskectomy  alone, 
laminectomy with diskectomy, or diskectomy with fusion. The risk of 
subsequent radiculopathy or myelopathy at cervical segments adja-
cent to a fusion is ~3% per year and 26% per decade. Although this 
risk is sometimes portrayed as a late complication of surgery, it may 
also reflect the natural history of degenerative cervical disk disease.

Section 2  Alterations in Body 
Temperature

18 Fever

Neeraj K. Surana, Charles A. Dinarello, 
Reuven Porat

Body temperature is controlled by the hypothalamus. Neurons in both 
the  preoptic  anterior  hypothalamus  and  the  posterior  hypothalamus 
receive two kinds of signals: one from peripheral nerves that transmit 
information  from  warmth/cold  receptors  in  the  skin  and  the  other 
from the temperature of the blood bathing the region. These two types 
of signals are integrated by the thermoregulatory center of the hypo-
thalamus  to  maintain  normal  temperature.  In  a  neutral  temperature 
environment,  the  human  metabolic  rate  produces  more  heat  than 
is  necessary  to  maintain  the  core  body  temperature  in  the  range  of 
36.5–37.5°C (97.7–99.5°F).

A normal body temperature is ordinarily maintained despite envi-
ronmental  variations  because  the  hypothalamic  thermoregulatory 
center  balances  the  excess  heat  production  derived  from  metabolic 
activity  in  muscle  and  the  liver  with  heat  dissipation  from  the  skin 
and  lungs.  According  to  a  study  of  >35,000  individuals  ≥18  years 
of  age  seen  in  routine  medical  visits,  the  mean  oral  temperature  is 
36.6°C (95% confidence interval, 35.7–37.3°C). In light of this study, a 
temperature of >37.7°C (>99.9°F), which represents the 99th percentile 
for  healthy  individuals,  defines  a  fever.  Importantly,  higher  ambient 
temperatures are linked to higher baseline body temperatures. Addi-
tionally, body temperatures have diurnal and seasonal variation, with 
low levels at 8 a.m. and during summer and higher levels at 4 p.m. and 
during  winter.  Baseline  temperatures  are  also  affected  by  age  (lower 
by  0.02°C  for  every  10-year  increase  in  age),  demographics  (Afri-
can-American  women  have  temperatures  0.052°C  higher  than  white 
men),  and  comorbid  conditions  (cancer  is  associated  with  0.02°C 
higher temperatures; hypothyroidism is linked to temperatures lower 
by 0.01°C). After controlling for age, sex, race, vital signs, and comor-
bidities, an increase in baseline temperature of 0.15°C (or 1 standard 
deviation)  intriguingly  translates  into  a  0.52%  absolute  increase  in 
1-year mortality.

Rectal  temperatures  are  generally  0.4°C  (0.7°F)  higher  than  oral 
readings. The lower oral readings are probably attributable to mouth 
breathing, which is a factor in patients with respiratory infections and 
rapid  breathing.  Lower-esophageal  temperatures  closely  reflect  core 
temperature. Tympanic membrane thermometers measure radiant heat 
from  the  tympanic  membrane  and  nearby  ear  canal  and  display  that 
absolute  value  (unadjusted  mode)  or  a  value  automatically  calculated 
from  the  absolute  reading  on  the  basis  of  nomograms  relating  the 
radiant  temperature  measured  to  actual  core  temperatures  obtained 
in  clinical  studies  (adjusted  mode).  These  measurements,  although 
convenient,  may  be  more  variable  than  directly  determined  oral  or 
rectal values. Studies in adults show that readings are lower with unad-
justed-mode than with adjusted-mode tympanic membrane thermom-
eters and that unadjusted-mode tympanic membrane values are 0.8°C 
(1.6°F) lower than rectal temperatures.

In women who menstruate, the a.m. temperature is generally lower 
during the 2 weeks before ovulation; it then rises by ~0.6°C (1°F) with 
ovulation and stays at that level until menses occur. During the luteal 
phase, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm remains the same.
FEVER VERSUS HYPERTHERMIA
Fever is an elevation of body temperature that exceeds the normal daily 
variation  and  occurs  in  conjunction  with  an  increase  in  the  hypotha-
lamic set point (e.g., from 37°C to 39°C). This shift of the set point from 
“normothermic” to febrile levels very much resembles the resetting of 

the  home  thermostat  to  a  higher  level  in  order  to  raise  the  ambient 
temperature  in  a  room.  Once  the  hypothalamic  set  point  is  raised, 
neurons  in  the  vasomotor  center  are  activated  and  vasoconstriction 
commences. The individual first notices vasoconstriction in the hands 
and  feet.  Shunting  of  blood  away  from  the  periphery  to  the  internal 
organs  essentially  decreases  heat  loss  from  the  skin,  and  the  person 
feels  cold.  For  most  fevers,  body  temperature  increases  by  1–2°C. 
Shivering,  which  increases  heat  production  from  the  muscles,  may 
begin  at  this  time;  however,  shivering  is  not  required  if  mechanisms 
of heat conservation raise blood temperature sufficiently. Nonshiver-
ing heat production from the liver also contributes to increasing core 
temperature. Behavioral adjustments (e.g., putting on more clothing or 
bedding) help raise body temperature by decreasing heat loss.

The  processes  of  heat  conservation  (vasoconstriction)  and  heat 
production  (shivering  and  increased  nonshivering  thermogenesis) 
continue until the temperature of the blood bathing the hypothalamic 
neurons  matches  the  new  “thermostat  setting.”  Once  that  point  is 
reached,  the  hypothalamus  maintains  the  temperature  at  the  febrile 
level by the same mechanisms of heat balance that function in the afe-
brile state. When the hypothalamic set point is again reset downward 
(in response to either a reduction in the concentration of pyrogens or 
the use of antipyretics), the processes of heat loss through vasodilation 
and sweating are initiated. Loss of heat by sweating and vasodilation 
continues  until  the  blood  temperature  at  the  hypothalamic  level 
matches the lower setting. Behavioral changes (e.g., removal of cloth-
ing) facilitate heat loss.

A  fever  of  >41.5°C  (>106.7°F)  is  called  hyperpyrexia.  This  extra-
ordinarily  high  fever  can  develop  in  patients  with  severe  infections 
but  most  commonly  occurs  in  patients  with  central  nervous  system 
(CNS) hemorrhages. In the preantibiotic era, fever due to a variety of 
infectious diseases rarely exceeded 106°F, and there has been specula-
tion  that  this  natural  “thermal  ceiling”  is  mediated  by  neuropeptides 
functioning as central antipyretics.

In  rare  cases,  the  hypothalamic  set  point  is  elevated  as  a  result  of 
local  trauma,  hemorrhage,  tumor,  or  intrinsic  hypothalamic  mal-
function. The term hypothalamic fever is sometimes used to describe 
elevated  temperature  caused  by  abnormal  hypothalamic  function. 
However,  most  patients  with  hypothalamic  damage  have  subnormal, 
not supranormal, body temperatures.

Although most patients with elevated body temperature have fever, 
there are circumstances in which elevated temperature represents not 
fever but hyperthermia (heat stroke). Hyperthermia is characterized by 
an uncontrolled increase in body temperature that exceeds the body’s 
ability to lose heat. The setting of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory 
center  is  unchanged.  In  contrast  to  fever  in  infections,  hyperthermia 
does  not  involve  pyrogenic  molecules.  Exogenous  heat  exposure  and 
endogenous  heat  production  are  two  mechanisms  by  which  hyper-
thermia can result in dangerously high internal temperatures. Exces-
sive heat production can easily cause hyperthermia despite physiologic 
and  behavioral  control  of  body  temperature.  For  example,  work  or 
exercise in hot environments can produce heat faster than peripheral 
mechanisms can lose it. For a detailed discussion of hyperthermia, 
see Chap. 465.

It  is  important  to  distinguish  between  fever  and  hyperthermia 
since  hyperthermia  can  be  rapidly  fatal  and  characteristically  does 
not  respond  to  antipyretics.  In  an  emergency  situation,  however, 
making  this  distinction  can  be  difficult.  For  example,  in  systemic 
sepsis, fever (hyperpyrexia) can be rapid in onset, and temperatures 
can  exceed  40.5°C  (104.9°F).  Hyperthermia  is  often  diagnosed  on 
the  basis  of  the  events  immediately  preceding  the  elevation  of  core  
temperature—e.g., heat exposure or treatment with drugs that interfere 
with thermoregulation. In patients with heat stroke syndromes and in 
those taking drugs that block sweating, the skin is hot but dry, whereas 
in  fever,  the  skin  can  be  cold  as  a  consequence  of  vasoconstriction. 
Antipyretics do not reduce the elevated temperature in hyperthermia, 
whereas in fever—and even in hyperpyrexia—adequate doses of either 
aspirin  or  acetaminophen  usually  result  in  some  decrease  in  body  
temperature.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesPATHOGENESIS OF FEVER
 ■ PYROGENS
The  term  pyrogen  (Greek  pyro,  “fire”)  is  used  to  describe  any  sub-
stance  that  causes  fever.  Exogenous  pyrogens  are  derived  from  out-
side  the  patient;  most  are  microbial  products,  microbial  toxins,  or 
whole microorganisms (including viruses). The classic example of an 
exogenous  pyrogen  is  the  lipopolysaccharide  (endotoxin)  produced 
by  all  gram-negative  bacteria.  Pyrogenic  products  of  gram-positive 
organisms  include  the  enterotoxins  of  Staphylococcus  aureus  and  the 
groups  A  and  B  streptococcal  toxins,  also  called  superantigens.  One 
staphylococcal  toxin  of  clinical  importance  is  that  associated  with 
isolates of S. aureus from patients with toxic shock syndrome. These 
products of staphylococci and streptococci cause fever in experimental 
animals when injected intravenously at concentrations of 1–10 μg/kg. 
Endotoxin  is  a  highly  pyrogenic  molecule  in  humans:  when  injected 
intravenously into volunteers, a dose of 2–3 ng/kg produces fever, leu-
kocytosis, acute-phase proteins, and generalized symptoms of malaise.
 ■ PYROGENIC CYTOKINES
Cytokines are small proteins (molecular mass, 10,000–20,000 Da) that 
regulate  immune,  inflammatory,  and  hematopoietic  processes.  For 
example,  the  elevated  leukocytosis  seen  in  several  infections  with  an 
absolute  neutrophilia  is  attributable  to  the  cytokines  interleukin  (IL) 
1  and  IL-6.  Some  cytokines  also  cause  fever;  formerly  referred  to  as 
endogenous  pyrogens,  they  are  now  called  pyrogenic  cytokines.  The 
pyrogenic cytokines include IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 
and ciliary neurotropic factor, a member of the IL-6 family. Fever is a 
prominent side effect of interferon α therapy. Each pyrogenic cytokine 
is encoded by a separate gene, and each has been shown to cause fever 
in laboratory animals and in humans. When injected into humans at 
low doses (10–100 ng/kg), IL-1 and TNF produce fever; in contrast, for 
IL-6, a dose of 1–10 μg/kg is required for fever production.

A  wide  spectrum  of  bacterial  and  fungal  products  induce  the 
synthesis  and  release  of  pyrogenic  cytokines.  However,  fever  can  be 
a  manifestation  of  disease  in  the  absence  of  microbial  infection.  For 
example, inflammatory processes such as pericarditis, trauma, stroke, 
and routine immunizations induce the production of IL-1, TNF, and/
or  IL-6;  individually  or  in  combination,  these  cytokines  trigger  the 
hypothalamus to raise the set point to febrile levels.
 ■ ELEVATION OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC SET POINT 
BY CYTOKINES
During fever, levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are elevated in hypo-
thalamic tissue and the third cerebral ventricle. The concentrations of 
PGE2 are highest near the circumventricular vascular organs (organum 
vasculosum  of  lamina  terminalis)—networks  of  enlarged  capillaries 
surrounding the hypothalamic regulatory centers. Destruction of these 
organs reduces the ability of pyrogens to produce fever. Most studies 
in animals have failed to show, however, that pyrogenic cytokines pass 
from  the  circulation  into  the  brain  itself.  Thus,  it  appears  that  both 
exogenous pyrogens and pyrogenic cytokines interact with the endo-
thelium of these capillaries and that this interaction is the first step in 
initiating fever—i.e., in raising the set point to febrile levels.

The key events in the production of fever are illustrated in Fig. 18-1. 
Myeloid and endothelial cells are the primary cell types that produce 
pyrogenic  cytokines.  Pyrogenic  cytokines  such  as  IL-1,  IL-6,  and 
TNF are released from these cells and enter the systemic circulation. 
Although  these  circulating  cytokines  lead  to  fever  by  inducing  the 
synthesis  of  PGE2,  they  also  induce  PGE2  in  peripheral  tissues.  The 
increase in PGE2 in the periphery accounts for the nonspecific myal-
gias and arthralgias that often accompany fever. It is thought that some 
systemic PGE2 escapes destruction by the lung and gains access to the 
hypothalamus via the internal carotid. However, it is the elevation of 
PGE2 in the brain that starts the process of raising the hypothalamic 
set point for core temperature.

There are four receptors for PGE2, and each signals the cell in differ-
ent ways. Of the four receptors, the third (EP-3) is essential for fever: 
when the gene for this receptor is deleted in mice, no fever follows the

genes leaves the fever mechanism intact. Although PGE2 is essential for 
fever, it is not a neurotransmitter. Rather, the release of PGE2 from the 
brain side of the hypothalamic endothelium triggers the PGE2 receptor 
on glial cells, and this stimulation results in the rapid release of cyclic 
adenosine  5′-monophosphate  (cAMP),  which  is  a  neurotransmitter. 
As  shown  in  Fig.  18-1,  the  release  of  cAMP  from  glial  cells  activates 
neuronal  endings  from  the  thermoregulatory  center  that  extend  into 
the area. The elevation of cAMP is thought to account for changes in 
the hypothalamic set point either directly or indirectly (by inducing the 
release of neurotransmitters). Distinct receptors for microbial products 
are  located  on  the  hypothalamic  endothelium.  These  receptors  are 
called Toll-like receptors and are similar in many ways to IL-1 receptors. 
IL-1 receptors and Toll-like receptors share the same signal-transducing 
mechanism.  Thus,  the  direct  activation  of  Toll-like  receptors  or  IL-1 
receptors results in PGE2 production and fever.
 ■ PRODUCTION OF CYTOKINES IN THE CNS
Cytokines produced in the brain may account for the hyperpyrexia of 
CNS  hemorrhage,  trauma,  or  infection.  Viral  infections  of  the  CNS 
induce  microglial  and  possibly  neuronal  production  of  IL-1,  TNF, 
and  IL-6.  In  experimental  animals,  the  concentration  of  a  cytokine 
required  to  cause  fever  is  several  orders  of  magnitude  lower  with 
direct injection into the brain substance or brain ventricles than with 
systemic injection. Therefore, cytokines produced in the CNS can raise 
the  hypothalamic  set  point,  bypassing  the  circumventricular  organs. 
CNS cytokines likely account for the hyperpyrexia of CNS hemorrhage, 
trauma, or infection.

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
There are a range of disease processes that present with fever as a 
cardinal manifestation, and a thorough history can help distinguish 
between  these  broad  categories  (Table  18-1).  The  chronology  of 
events  preceding  fever,  including  exposure  to  other  symptomatic 
individuals  or  to  vectors  of  disease,  should  be  ascertained.  Elec-
tronic  devices  for  measuring  oral,  tympanic  membrane,  or  rectal 
temperatures are reliable, but the same site should be used consis-
tently to monitor a febrile disease. Moreover, physicians should be 
aware that newborns, elderly patients, patients with chronic hepatic 
or renal failure, and patients taking glucocorticoids or being treated 
with an anticytokine may have active disease in the absence of fever 
because of a blunted febrile response.

TABLE 18-1  Disease Categories That Present with Fever as a  
Cardinal Sign
Infectious diseases
Autoimmune and noninfectious inflammatory disorders
Cancer
Medication related (e.g., vaccines, drug fever)
Endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperthyroidism)
Intrinsic hypothalamic malfunction

LABORATORY TESTS
The workup should include a complete blood count; a differential 
count should be performed manually or with an instrument sensi-
tive to the identification of juvenile or band forms, toxic granula-
tions, and Döhle bodies, which are suggestive of bacterial infection. 
Neutropenia may be present with some viral infections.

Measurement  of  circulating  cytokines  in  patients  with  fever  is 
not  helpful  since  levels  of  cytokines  such  as  IL-1  and  TNF  in  the 
circulation often are below the detection limit of the assay or do not 
coincide with fever. However, in patients with low-grade fevers or 
with suspected occult disease, the most valuable measurements are 
the C-reactive protein (CRP) level and the erythrocyte sedimenta-
tion rate. These markers of inflammatory processes are particularly 
helpful  in  detecting  occult  disease.  Measurement  of  circulating 
IL-6,  which  induces  CRP,  can  be  useful.  However,  whereas  IL-6 
levels may vary during a febrile disease, CRP levels remain elevated. 
Acute-phase reactants are discussed in Chap. 304. 
FEVER IN PATIENTS RECEIVING ANTICYTOKINE THERAPY
Patients  receiving  long-term  treatment  with  anticytokine-based 
regimens are at increased risk of infection because of lowered host 
defenses. For example, latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection 
can  disseminate  in  patients  receiving  anti-TNF  therapy.  With  the 
increasing use of anticytokines to reduce the activity of IL-1, IL-6, 
IL-12, IL-17, or TNF in patients with Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid 
arthritis, or psoriasis, the possibility that these therapies blunt the 
febrile response should be kept in mind.

The blocking of cytokine activity has the distinct clinical draw-
back  of  lowering  the  level  of  host  defenses  against  both  routine 
bacterial and opportunistic infections such as M. tuberculosis and 
fungal infections. The use of monoclonal antibodies to reduce IL-17 
in psoriasis increases the risk of systemic candidiasis.

In nearly all reported cases of infection associated with anticy-
tokine therapy, fever is among the presenting signs. However, the 
extent  to  which  the  febrile  response  is  blunted  in  these  patients 
remains unknown. Therefore, low-grade fever in patients receiving 
anticytokine  therapies  is  of  considerable  concern.  The  physician 
should conduct an early and rigorous diagnostic evaluation in these 
cases.  The  febrile  response  is  also  blunted  in  patients  receiving 
chronic glucocorticoid therapy or anti-inflammatory agents such as 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

TREATMENT
Fever 

THE DECISION TO TREAT FEVER
In deciding whether to treat fever, it is important to remember that 
fever itself is not an illness: it is an ordinary response to a pertur-
bation of normal host physiology. Most fevers are associated with 
self-limited infections, such as common viral diseases. The use of 
antipyretics is not contraindicated in these infections: no significant 
clinical evidence indicates either that antipyretics delay the resolu-
tion of viral or bacterial infections or that fever facilitates recovery 
from  infection  or  acts  as  an  adjuvant  to  the  immune  system.  In 
short, treatment of fever and its symptoms with routine antipyretics 

does  no  harm  and  does  not  slow  the  resolution  of  common  viral 
and bacterial infections.

However, in bacterial infections, the withholding of antipyretic 
therapy can be helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of a particular 
antibiotic, especially in the absence of positive cultures of the infect-
ing organism, and the routine use of antipyretics can mask an inad-
equately  treated  bacterial  infection.  Withholding  antipyretics  in 
some cases may facilitate the diagnosis of an unusual febrile disease. 
Temperature–pulse  dissociation  (relative  bradycardia)  occurs  in 
typhoid fever, brucellosis, leptospirosis, some drug-induced fevers, 
and factitious fever. As stated earlier, in newborns, elderly patients, 
patients  with  chronic  liver  or  kidney  failure,  and  patients  taking 
glucocorticoids, fever may not be present despite infection. Hypo-
thermia can develop in patients with septic shock.

Some  infections  have  characteristic  patterns  in  which  febrile 
episodes  are  separated  by  intervals  of  normal  temperature.  For 
example,  Plasmodium  vivax  causes  fever  every  third  day,  whereas 
fever occurs every fourth day with Plasmodium malariae. Another 
relapsing  fever  is  related  to  Borrelia  infection,  with  days  of  fever 
followed  by  a  several-day  afebrile  period  and  then  a  relapse  into 
additional  days  of  fever.  In  the  Pel-Ebstein  pattern,  fever  lasting 
3–10 days is followed by afebrile periods of 3–10 days; this pattern 
can be classic for Hodgkin’s disease and other lymphomas. In cyclic 
neutropenia, fevers occur every 21 days and accompany the neutro-
penia. There are also a number of periodic fever syndromes (e.g., 
familial  Mediterranean  fever,  TNF  receptor–associated  periodic 
syndrome  [TRAPS])  that  differ  in  their  periodicity,  duration  of 
attack, constellation of clinical features, genetic causes, and thera-
pies (Chap. 369). Understanding these clinical differences can help 
tailor diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy. 
ANTICYTOKINE THERAPY TO REDUCE FEVER IN 
AUTOIMMUNE AND AUTOINFLAMMATORY DISEASES
Recurrent fever is documented at some point in most autoimmune 
diseases  and  many  autoinflammatory  diseases,  which  include  the 
periodic  fever  syndromes  as  well  as  disorders  of  inflammasomes 
(e.g., NLRP3, pyrin) and other components of the innate immune 
system (Chap. 349). Although fever can be a manifestation of auto-
immune diseases, recurrent fevers are characteristic of autoinflam-
matory diseases, including uncommon diseases such as adult and 
juvenile Still’s disease, familial Mediterranean fever, and hyper-IgD 
syndrome but also common diseases such as idiopathic pericarditis 
and gout. In addition to recurrent fevers, neutrophilia and serosal 
inflammation  characterize  autoinflammatory  diseases.  The  fevers 
associated with many of these illnesses are dramatically reduced by 
blocking of IL-1 activity with anakinra or canakinumab. Anticytok-
ines therefore reduce fever in autoimmune and autoinflammatory 
diseases. Although fevers in  autoinflammatory  diseases  are medi-
ated by IL-1β, patients also respond to antipyretics. 
MECHANISMS OF ANTIPYRETIC AGENTS
The  reduction  of  fever  by  lowering  of  the  elevated  hypothalamic 
set point is a direct function of reduction of the PGE2 level in the 
thermoregulatory  center.  The  synthesis  of  PGE2  depends  on  the 
constitutively expressed enzyme cyclooxygenase. The substrate for 
cyclooxygenase  is  arachidonic  acid  released  from  the  cell  mem-
brane, and this release is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of 
PGE2. Therefore, inhibitors of cyclooxygenase are potent antipyret-
ics. The antipyretic potency of various drugs is directly correlated 
with  the  inhibition  of  brain  cyclooxygenase.  Acetaminophen  is  a 
poor cyclooxygenase inhibitor in peripheral tissue and lacks note-
worthy anti-inflammatory activity; in the brain, however, acetamin-
ophen is oxidized by the P450 cytochrome system, and the oxidized 
form  inhibits  cyclooxygenase  activity.  Moreover,  in  the  brain,  the 
inhibition  of  another  enzyme,  COX-3,  by  acetaminophen  may 
account for the antipyretic effect of this agent. However, COX-3 is 
not found outside the CNS.

Oral aspirin and acetaminophen are equally effective in reducing 
fever  in  humans.  NSAIDs  such  as  ibuprofen  and  specific  inhibi-
tors  of  COX-2  also  are  excellent  antipyretics.  Chronic,  high-dose 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   132

21/01/22   3:36 PM

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasestherapy  with  antipyretics  such  as  aspirin  or  any  NSAID  does  not 
reduce normal core body temperature. Thus, PGE2 appears to play 
no role in normal thermoregulation.

As effective antipyretics, glucocorticoids act at two levels. First, 
similar  to  the  cyclooxygenase  inhibitors,  glucocorticoids  reduce 
PGE2 synthesis by inhibiting the activity of phospholipase A2, which 
is  needed  to  release  arachidonic  acid  from  the  cell  membrane.   
Second,  glucocorticoids  block  the  transcription  of  the  mRNA  for 
the  pyrogenic  cytokines.  Limited  experimental  evidence  indicates 
that ibuprofen and COX-2 inhibitors reduce IL-1-induced IL-6 pro-
duction and may contribute to the antipyretic activity of NSAIDs. 

REGIMENS FOR THE TREATMENT OF FEVER
The objectives in treating fever are first to reduce the elevated hypo-
thalamic set point and second to facilitate heat loss. Reducing fever 
with  antipyretics  also  reduces  systemic  symptoms  of  headache, 
myalgias, and arthralgias.

Oral  aspirin  and  NSAIDs  effectively  reduce  fever  but  can 
adversely  affect  platelets  and  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Therefore, 
acetaminophen is preferred as an antipyretic. In children, acetamin-
ophen or oral ibuprofen must be used because aspirin increases the 
risk of Reye’s syndrome. If the patient cannot take oral antipyretics, 
parenteral preparations of NSAIDs and rectal suppositories of vari-
ous antipyretics can be used.

Treatment  of  fever  in  some  patients  is  highly  recommended. 
Fever increases the demand for oxygen (i.e., for every increase of 
1°C over 37°C, there is a 13% increase in oxygen consumption) and 
can aggravate the condition of patients with preexisting impairment 
of cardiac, pulmonary, or CNS function. Children with a history of 
febrile or nonfebrile seizure should be aggressively treated to reduce 
fever.  However,  it  is  unclear  what  triggers  the  febrile  seizure,  and 
there is no correlation between absolute temperature elevation and 
onset of a febrile seizure in susceptible children.

In hyperpyrexia, the use of cooling blankets facilitates the reduc-
tion of temperature; however, cooling blankets should not be used 
without oral antipyretics. In hyperpyretic patients with CNS disease 
or trauma (CNS bleeding), reducing core temperature mitigates the 
detrimental effects of high temperature on the brain.

For a discussion of treatment for hyperthermia, see Chap. 465.

19 Fever and Rash

Elaine T. Kaye, Kenneth M. Kaye

The acutely ill patient with fever and rash often presents a diagnostic 
challenge for physicians, yet the distinctive appearance of an eruption 
in concert with a clinical syndrome can facilitate a prompt diagnosis 
and  the  institution  of  life-saving  therapy  or  critical  infection-control 
interventions. Representative images of many of the rashes discussed 
in this chapter are included in Chap. A1.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Fever and Rash

A  thorough  history  of  patients  with  fever  and  rash  includes  the 
following relevant information: immune status, medications taken 
within  the  previous  month,  specific  travel  history,  immunization 
status,  exposure  to  domestic  pets  and  other  animals,  history  of 
animal (including arthropod) bites, recent dietary exposures, exis-
tence  of  cardiac  abnormalities,  presence  of  prosthetic  material, 
recent exposure to ill individuals, and sexual exposures. The history 
should also include the site of onset of the rash and its direction and 
rate of spread. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
A thorough physical examination entails close attention to the rash, 
with  an  assessment  and  precise  definition  of  its  salient  features. 
First,  it  is  critical  to  determine  what  type  of  lesions  make  up  the 
eruption.  Macules  are  flat  lesions  defined  by  an  area  of  changed 
color (i.e., a blanchable erythema). Papules are raised, solid lesions 
<5 mm in diameter; plaques are lesions >5 mm in diameter with a 
flat, plateau-like surface; and nodules are lesions >5 mm in diam-
eter with a more rounded configuration. Wheals (urticaria, hives) 
are papules or plaques that are pale pink and may appear annular 
(ringlike)  as  they  enlarge;  classic  (nonvasculitic)  wheals  are  tran-
sient, lasting only 24 h in any defined area. Vesicles (<5 mm) and 
bullae (>5 mm) are circumscribed, elevated lesions containing fluid. 
Pustules  are  raised  lesions  containing  purulent  exudate;  vesicular 
processes  such  as  varicella  or  herpes  simplex  may  evolve  to  pus-
tules.  Nonpalpable  purpura  is  a  flat  lesion  that  is  due  to  bleeding 
into the skin. If <3 mm in diameter, the purpuric lesions are termed 
petechiae; if >3 mm, they are termed ecchymoses. Palpable purpura 
is a raised lesion that is due to inflammation of the vessel wall (vas-
culitis) with subsequent hemorrhage. An ulcer is a defect in the skin 
extending at least into the upper layer of the dermis, and an eschar 
(tâche noire) is a necrotic lesion covered with a black crust.

Other  pertinent  features  of  rashes  include  their  configuration 
(i.e., annular or target), the arrangement of their lesions, and their 
distribution (i.e., central or peripheral).

For further discussion, see Chaps. 56, 58, 122, and 129.

 ■ CLASSIFICATION OF RASH
This  chapter  reviews  rashes  that  reflect  systemic  disease,  but  it  does 
not include localized skin eruptions (i.e., cellulitis, impetigo) that may 
also be associated with fever (Chap. 129). The chapter is not intended 
to be all-inclusive, but it covers the most important and most common 
diseases  associated  with  fever  and  rash.  Rashes  are  classified  herein 
on the basis of lesion morphology and distribution. For practical pur-
poses,  this  classification  system  is  based  on  the  most  typical  disease 
presentations.  However,  morphology  may  vary  as  rashes  evolve,  and 
the presentation of diseases with rashes is subject to many variations 
(Chap. 58). For instance, the classic petechial rash of Rocky Mountain 
spotted  fever  (Chap. 187)  may  initially  consist  of  blanchable  erythe-
matous  macules  distributed  peripherally;  at  times,  however,  the  rash 
associated with this disease may not be predominantly acral, or no rash 
may develop at all.

Diseases with fever and rash may be classified by type of eruption: 
centrally distributed maculopapular, peripheral, confluent desquama-
tive  erythematous,  vesiculobullous,  urticaria-like,  nodular,  purpuric, 
ulcerated,  or  with  eschars.  Diseases  are  listed  by  these  categories  in 
Table 19-1, and many are highlighted in the text. However, for a more 
detailed discussion of each disease associated with a rash, the reader is 
referred  to  the  chapter  dealing  with  that  specific  disease.  (Reference 
chapters are cited in the text and listed in Table 19-1.)

 ■ CENTRALLY DISTRIBUTED MACULOPAPULAR 
ERUPTIONS
Centrally distributed rashes, in which lesions are primarily truncal, are 
the most common type of eruption. The rash of rubeola (measles) starts

Drugs (mostly 
anticonvulsants or 
antimicrobials); also viral

vesicular, or pustular lesions that may 
involve axillae, buttocks, abdomen, and 
especially areas occluded by bathing 
suits; can manifest as tender isolated 
nodules on palmar or plantar surfaces (the 
latter designated “Pseudomonas hot-foot 
syndrome”)
Red macules on tongue and palate evolving 
to papules and vesicles; skin macules 
evolving to papules, then vesicles, then 
pustules over 1 week, with subsequent 
lesion crusting; lesions initially appearing 
on face and spreading centrifugally from 
trunk to extremities; differs from varicella in 
that (1) skin lesions in any given area are at 
same stage of development and (2) there is a 
prominent distribution of lesions on face and 
extremities (including palms, soles)
Erythema rapidly followed by hallmark 
painful grouped vesicles that may evolve into 
pustules that ulcerate, especially on mucosal 
surfaces; lesions at site of inoculation: 
commonly gingivostomatitis for HSV-1 and 
genital lesions for HSV-2; recurrent disease 
milder (e.g., herpes labialis does not involve 
oral mucosa)
Generalized vesicles that can evolve to 
pustules and ulcerations; individual lesions 
similar for VZV and HSV. Zoster cutaneous 
dissemination: >25 lesions extending outside 
involved dermatome. HSV: extensive, 
progressive mucocutaneous lesions that 
may occur in absence of dissemination, 
sometimes disseminate in eczematous 
skin (eczema herpeticum); HSV visceral 
dissemination may occur with only localized 
mucocutaneous disease; in disseminated 
neonatal disease, skin lesions diagnostically 
helpful when present, but rash absent in a 
substantial minority of cases

common among children <3 years of age (Chap. 195). As in erythema 
infectiosum, the rash usually appears after fever has subsided. It con-
sists of 2- to 3-mm rose-pink macules and papules that coalesce only 
rarely, occur initially on the trunk (Fig. A1-5) and sometimes on the 
extremities (sparing the face), and fade within 2 days.

Although drug reactions have many manifestations, including urti-
caria,  exanthematous  drug-induced  eruptions  (Chap.  60)  (Fig.  A1-7) 
are  most  common  and  are  often  difficult  to  distinguish  from  viral 
exanthems. Eruptions elicited by drugs are usually more intensely ery-
thematous and pruritic than viral exanthems, but this distinction is not 
reliable.  A  history  of  new  medications  and  an  absence  of  prostration 
may help to distinguish a drug-related rash from an eruption of another 
etiology. Rashes may persist for up to 2 weeks after administration of 
the offending agent is discontinued. Certain populations are more prone 
than others to drug rashes. Of HIV-infected patients, 50–60% develop a 
rash in response to sulfa drugs; 30–90% of patients with mononucleosis 
due to Epstein-Barr virus develop a rash when given ampicillin.

Rickettsial illnesses (Chap. 187) should be considered in the evalua-
tion of individuals with centrally distributed maculopapular eruptions. 
The usual setting for epidemic typhus is a site of war or natural disaster 
in which people are exposed to body lice. Endemic typhus or leptospirosis 
(the  latter  caused  by  a  spirochete)  (Chap.  184)  may  be  seen  in  urban 
environments where rodents proliferate. Outside the United States, other 
rickettsial diseases cause a spotted-fever syndrome and should be con-
sidered in residents of or travelers to endemic areas. Similarly, typhoid 
fever,  a  nonrickettsial  disease  caused  by  Salmonella  typhi  (Chap.  165) 
(Fig. A1-9), is usually acquired during travel outside the United States. 
Dengue fever (Fig. A1-53), caused by a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus, 
occurs in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Chap. 209).

Some  centrally  distributed  maculopapular  eruptions  have  distinc-
tive features. Erythema migrans (Fig. A1-8), the rash of Lyme disease 
(Chap. 186), typically manifests as single or multiple annular lesions. 
Untreated erythema migrans lesions usually fade within a month but 
may persist for more than a year. Southern tick-associated rash illness 
(STARI)  (Chap.  186)  has  an  erythema  migrans–like  rash,  but  is  less 
severe than Lyme disease and often occurs in regions where Lyme is 
not endemic. Erythema marginatum, the rash of acute rheumatic fever 
(Chap. 359), has a distinctive pattern of enlarging and shifting tran-
sient annular lesions.

Collagen vascular diseases may cause fever and rash. Patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (Chap. 356) typically develop a sharply 
defined,  erythematous  eruption  in  a  butterfly  distribution  on  the 
cheeks (malar rash) (Fig. A1-10) as well as many other skin manifes-
tations (Figs. A1-11, A1-12). Still’s disease presents as an evanescent,  
salmon-colored rash on the trunk and proximal extremities that coin-
cides with fever spikes (Fig. A1-13).

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may be familial or triggered 
by  infection,  autoimmunity,  or  neoplasia.  Cutaneous  manifestations 
are  protean  and  can  present  as  an  erythematous  maculopapular 
eruption,  pyoderma  gangrenosum,  purpura,  panniculitis,  or  Stevens 
Johnson syndrome.

Zika  virus  is  a  mosquito-transmitted  flavivirus  that  is  associated 
with  severe  birth  defects  (Chap.  209).  Zika  is  widespread  among 
tropical  and  subtropical  regions  of  the  world.  The  eruption  of  Zika 
virus infection (Fig. A1-51A, A1-51B) is typically pruritic and often 
accompanied by conjunctival injection (Fig. A1-51C).

 ■ PERIPHERAL ERUPTIONS
These  rashes  are  alike  in  that  they  are  most  prominent  peripherally 
or  begin  in  peripheral  (acral)  areas  before  spreading  centripetally. 
Early  diagnosis  and  therapy  are  critical  in  Rocky  Mountain  spotted 
fever (Chap. 187) because of its grave prognosis if untreated. Lesions 
(Fig.  19-2;  see  also  Fig.  A1-16)  evolve  from  macular  to  petechial, 
start on the wrists and ankles, spread centripetally, and appear on the 
palms and soles only later in the disease. The rash of secondary syphilis  
(Chap. 182), which may be generalized (Fig. A1-18) but is prominent 
on the palms and soles (Fig. A1-19), should be considered in the differ-
ential diagnosis of pityriasis rosea, especially in sexually active patients. 
Chikungunya fever (Chap. 209), which is transmitted by mosquito bite 

FIGURE  19-1  Centrally  distributed,  maculopapular  eruption  on  the  trunk  in  a 
patient with measles. (From EJ Mayeaux Jr et al: Measles, in Usatine RP et al [eds]: 
Color Atlas and Synopsis of Family Medicine, 3rd ed. New York, McGraw-Hill, 2019, 
p. 797, Figure 132-2. Reproduced with permission from Richard P. Usatine, MD.)

at the hairline 2–3 days into the illness and moves down the body, typi-
cally sparing the palms and soles (Fig. 19-1; see also Fig. A1-3) (Chap. 
205).  It  begins  as  discrete  erythematous  lesions,  which  become  con-
fluent as the rash spreads. Koplik’s spots (1- to 2-mm white or bluish 
lesions with an erythematous halo on the buccal mucosa) (Fig. A1-2) 
are pathognomonic for measles and are generally seen during the first 
2 days of symptoms. They should not be confused with Fordyce’s spots 
(ectopic sebaceous glands), which have no erythematous halos and are 
found in the mouth of healthy individuals. Koplik’s spots may briefly 
overlap with the measles exanthem.

Rubella (German measles) (Fig. A1-4) also spreads from the hairline 
downward; unlike that of measles, however, the rash of rubella tends 
to clear from originally affected areas as it migrates, and it may be pru-
ritic (Chap. 206). Forchheimer spots (palatal petechiae) may develop 
but  are  nonspecific  because  they  also  develop  in  infectious  mononu-
cleosis (Chap. 194), scarlet fever (Chap. 148), and Zika virus infection  
(Chap. 209) (Fig. A1-51D). Postauricular and suboccipital adenopa-
thy and arthritis are common among adults with rubella. Exposure of 
pregnant women to ill individuals should be avoided, as rubella causes 
severe  congenital  abnormalities.  Numerous  strains  of  enteroviruses 
(Chap. 204), primarily echoviruses and coxsackieviruses, cause non-
specific syndromes of fever and eruptions that may mimic rubella or 
measles. Patients with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr 
virus (Chap. 194) or with primary HIV infection (Fig. A1-6; see also 
Chapter 202) may exhibit pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and a non-
specific maculopapular exanthem.

The  rash  of  erythema  infectiosum  (fifth  disease),  which  is  caused 
by  human  parvovirus  B19,  primarily  affects  children  3–12  years  old; 
it develops after fever has resolved as a bright blanchable erythema on 
the cheeks (“slapped cheeks”) (Fig. A1-1A) with perioral pallor (Chap. 
197). A more diffuse rash (often pruritic) appears the next day on the 
trunk and extremities and then rapidly develops into a lacy reticular 
eruption (Fig. A1-1B) that may wax and wane (especially with temper-
ature change) over 3 weeks. Adults with fifth disease often have arthri-
tis, and fetal hydrops can develop in association with this condition in 
pregnant women.

Exanthem subitum (roseola) is caused by human herpesvirus 6, or 
less commonly by the closely related human herpesvirus 7, and is most

the  prodrome  of  fever  and  malaise;  profound  tenderness  of  the  skin 
is distinctive. In the exfoliative stage, the skin can be induced to form 
bullae with light lateral pressure (Nikolsky’s sign) (Fig. 19-3). In a mild 
form,  a  scarlatiniform  eruption  mimics  scarlet  fever,  but  the  patient 
does not exhibit a strawberry tongue or circumoral pallor. In contrast 
to  the  staphylococcal  scalded-skin  syndrome,  in  which  the  cleavage 
plane is superficial in the epidermis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (Chap. 
60), a maximal variant of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, involves slough-
ing  of  the  entire  epidermis  (Fig.  A1-26),  resulting  in  severe  disease. 
Exfoliative  erythroderma  syndrome  (Chaps.  58  and  60)  is  a  serious 
reaction associated with systemic toxicity that is often due to eczema, 
psoriasis  (Fig.  A1-27),  a  drug  reaction,  or  mycosis  fungoides.  Drug 
rash  with  eosinophilia  and  systemic  symptoms  (DRESS),  often  due  to 
antiepileptic and antibiotic agents (Chap. 60), initially appears similar 
to an exanthematous drug reaction (Fig. A1-48) but may progress to 
exfoliative erythroderma; it is accompanied by multiorgan failure and 
has an associated mortality rate of ~10%.

 ■ VESICULOBULLOUS OR PUSTULAR ERUPTIONS
Varicella (Chap. 193) is highly contagious, often occurring in winter 
or spring, and is characterized by pruritic lesions that, within a given 
region of the body, are in different stages of development at any point 
in  time  (Fig.  19-4;  see  also  Fig.  A1-30).  In  immunocompromised 
hosts,  varicella  vesicles  may  lack  the  characteristic  erythematous 
base  or  may  appear  hemorrhagic.  Lesions  of  Pseudomonas  “hot-tub” 
folliculitis  (Chap.  164)  are  also  pruritic  and  may  appear  similar  to 
those of varicella (Fig. A1-55). However, hot-tub folliculitis generally 
occurs in outbreaks after bathing in hot tubs or swimming pools, and 
lesions occur in regions occluded by bathing suits. Lesions of variola 
(smallpox) (Chap. S3) also appear similar to those of varicella but are

Figure 25-50; with permission.)

in tropical and subtropical regions, is associated with a maculopapular 
eruption (Fig. A1-54) and severe polyarticular small-joint arthralgias. 
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (Chap. 204), most commonly caused by 
coxsackievirus A16 or enterovirus 71, is distinguished by tender vesi-
cles distributed on the hands and feet and in the mouth (Fig. A1-22); 
coxsackievirus  A6  causes  an  atypical  syndrome  with  more  extensive 
lesions. The classic target lesions of erythema multiforme (Fig. A1-24) 
appear  symmetrically  on  the  elbows,  knees, 
palms,  soles,  and  face.  In  severe  cases,  these 
lesions  spread  diffusely  and  involve  mucosal 
surfaces. Lesions may develop on the hands and 
feet  in  endocarditis  (Fig.  A1-23)  (Chap.  128). 
Pernio,  tender  violaceous  lesions  that  are  acral 
(Fig. A1-57), occur most commonly on the feet, 
in  asymptomatic  or  mild  COVID-19.  Vesicles, 
urticaria, or maculopapular eruptions, often pru-
ritic, may occur on the trunk and extremities in 
moderate  or  severe  disease,  while  retiform  pur-
pura  occurs  on  the  extremities  and  buttocks  in 
severe COVID-19.

 ■ CONFLUENT DESQUAMATIVE 
ERYTHEMAS
These eruptions consist of diffuse erythema fre-
quently followed by desquamation. The eruptions 
caused by group A Streptococcus or Staphylococcus 
aureus  are  toxin-mediated.  Scarlet  fever  (Chap. 
148)  (Fig.  A1-25)  usually  follows  pharyngitis; 
patients have a facial flush, a “strawberry” tongue, 
and accentuated petechiae in body folds (Pastia’s 
lines). Kawasaki disease (Fig. A1-29) (Chaps. 58 
and  363)  presents  in  the  pediatric  population 
as  fissuring  of  the  lips,  a  strawberry  tongue, 
conjunctivitis,  adenopathy,  and  sometimes  car-
diac  abnormalities.  Streptococcal  toxic  shock 
syndrome  (Chap.  148)  manifests  with  hypoten-
sion,  multiorgan  failure,  and,  often,  a  severe 
group A streptococcal infection (e.g., necrotizing 
fasciitis).  Staphylococcal  toxic  shock  syndrome 
(Chap. 147) also presents with hypotension and 
multiorgan  failure,  but  usually  only  S.  aureus  
colonization—not a severe S. aureus infection—is 
documented. Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome  
(Fig.  A1-28)  (Chap.  147)  is  seen  primarily  in 
children  and  in  immunocompromised  adults. 
Generalized  erythema  is  often  evident  during 

FIGURE 19-3  Confluent desquamative erythema in a patient with Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome. 
Nikolsky  sign  evident  as  shearing  of  epidermis  due  to  gentle,  lateral  pressure.  (From  K  Wolff  et  al  [eds]:

 ■ NODULAR ERUPTIONS
In immunocompromised hosts, nodular lesions often represent dissem-
inated  infection.  Patients  with  disseminated  candidiasis  (Fig.  A1-37) 
(often  due  to  Candida  tropicalis)  may  have  a  triad  of  fever,  myalgias, 
and eruptive nodules (Chap. 216). Disseminated cryptococcosis lesions 
(Fig.  19-6;  see  also  Fig.  A1-36)  (Chap.  215)  may  resemble  mollus-
cum  contagiosum  (Chap.  196).  Necrosis  of  nodules  should  raise  the 
suspicion  of  aspergillosis  (Fig.  A1-38)  (Chap.  217)  or  mucormycosis  

FIGURE  19-6  Nodular  eruption  on  the  face  due  to  disseminated  Cryptococcus

all  at  the  same  stage  of  development  in  a  given  region  of  the  body 
(Figs.  A1-50B,  A1-50C).  Variola  lesions  are  most  prominent  on  the 
face  (Fig.  A1-50A)  and  extremities,  while  varicella  lesions  are  most 
prominent on the trunk. Herpes simplex virus infection (Chap. 192) is 
characterized by hallmark grouped vesicles on an erythematous base. 
Primary herpes infection is accompanied by fever and toxicity, while 
recurrent disease is milder. Rickettsialpox (Chap. 187) is often docu-
mented in urban settings and is characterized by vesicles followed by 
pustules (Figs. A1-33B, A1-33C). It can be distinguished from vari-
cella by an eschar at the site of the mouse-mite bite (Fig. A1-33A) and 
the papule/plaque base of each vesicle. Acute generalized exanthematous 
pustulosis  (Fig.  A1-49)  should  be  considered  in  individuals  who  are 
acutely febrile and are taking new medications, especially anticonvul-
sant or antimicrobial agents (Chap. 60). Disseminated Vibrio vulnificus 
infection  (Chap.  168)  or  ecthyma  gangrenosum  due  to  Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (Fig. A1-34) (Chap. 164) should be considered in immuno-
suppressed individuals with sepsis and hemorrhagic bullae. In children, 
Mycoplasma  pneumoniae–induced  rash  and  mucositis  (MIRM)  (Fig. 
A1-56)  is  characterized  by  a  sparse,  often  vesiculobullous  eruption 
with prominent oral, ocular, or urogenital mucositis.

 ■ URTICARIA-LIKE ERUPTIONS
Individuals  with  classic  urticaria  (“hives”)  (Fig.  19-5;  see  also  Fig. 
A1-35) usually have a hypersensitivity reaction without associated fever. 
In the presence of fever, urticaria-like eruptions are most often due to 
urticarial vasculitis (Chap. 363). Unlike individual lesions of classic urti-
caria, which last up to 24 h, these lesions may last 3–5 days. Etiologies 
include serum sickness (often induced by drugs such as penicillins, sul-
fas, salicylates, or barbiturates), connective-tissue disease (e.g., systemic 
lupus  erythematosus  or  Sjögren’s  syndrome),  and  infection  (e.g.,  with 
hepatitis B virus, enteroviruses, or parasites). Malignancy, especially lym-
phoma, may be associated with fever and chronic urticaria (Chap. 58).

fulminans (Fig. 19-7; see also Fig. A1-41) (Chaps. 155 and 304) reflect 
severe underlying disseminated intravascular coagulation, which may be 
due to infectious or noninfectious causes. The lesions of chronic menin-
gococcemia (Fig. A1-42) (Chap. 155) may have a variety of morpholo-
gies, including petechial. Purpuric nodules may develop on the legs and 
resemble erythema nodosum but lack its exquisite tenderness. Lesions 
of disseminated gonococcemia (Chap. 156) are distinctive, sparse, count-
able hemorrhagic pustules (Fig. A1-43), usually located near joints. The 
lesions of chronic meningococcemia and those of gonococcemia may be 
indistinguishable in terms of appearance and distribution. Viral hemor-
rhagic fever (Chaps. 209 and 210) should be considered in patients with 
an  appropriate  travel  history  and  a  petechial  rash.  Thrombotic  throm-
bocytopenic  purpura  (Chaps.  58,  100,  and  115)  and  hemolytic-uremic 
syndrome (Chaps. 115, 161, and 166) are closely related and are non-
infectious causes of fever and petechiae. Cutaneous small-vessel vascu-
litis (leukocytoclastic vasculitis) typically manifests as palpable purpura  
(Fig. A1-44) and has a wide variety of causes (Chap. 58).

 ■ ERUPTIONS WITH ULCERS OR ESCHARS
The presence of an ulcer or eschar (Fig. 19-8) in the setting of a more 
widespread eruption can provide an important diagnostic clue. For exam-
ple, an eschar may suggest the diagnosis of scrub typhus or rickettsialpox  
(Fig. A1-33A) (Chap. 187) in the appropriate setting. In other illnesses 
(e.g., anthrax) (Fig. A1-52) (Chap. S3), an ulcer or eschar may be the 
only skin manifestation.

(Chap. 218). Erythema nodosum presents with exquisitely tender nodules 
on the lower extremities (Fig. A1-39). Sweet syndrome (Chap. 58) should 
be  considered  in  individuals  with  multiple  nodules  and  plaques,  often 
so edematous (Fig. A1-40) that they give the appearance of vesicles or 
bullae. Sweet syndrome may occur in individuals with infection, inflam-
matory bowel disease, or malignancy and can also be induced by drugs.
 ■ PURPURIC ERUPTIONS
Acute meningococcemia (Chap. 155) classically presents in children as a 
petechial eruption, but initial lesions may appear as blanchable macules 
or urticaria. Rocky Mountain spotted fever should be considered in the 
differential diagnosis of acute meningococcemia. Echovirus 9 infection 
(Chap.  204)  may  mimic  acute  meningococcemia;  patients  should  be 
treated as if they have bacterial sepsis because prompt differentiation of 
these conditions may be impossible. Large ecchymotic areas of purpura

Clinicians  commonly  refer  to  any  febrile  illness  without  an  initially 
obvious  etiology  as  fever  of  unknown  origin  (FUO).  Most  febrile  ill-
nesses either resolve before a diagnosis can be made or develop distin-
guishing characteristics that lead to a diagnosis. The term FUO should 
be reserved for prolonged febrile illnesses without an established eti-
ology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing. This chapter 
focuses on FUO in the adult patient.

FUO was originally defined by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961 as an 
illness  of  >3  weeks’  duration  with  fever  of  ≥38.3°C  (≥101°F)  on  two 
occasions and an uncertain diagnosis despite 1 week of inpatient evalu-
ation. Nowadays, most patients with FUO are hospitalized only if their 
clinical  condition  requires  it,  and  not  for  diagnostic  purposes  alone; 
thus the in-hospital evaluation requirement has been eliminated from 
the definition. The definition of FUO has been further modified by the 
exclusion  of  immunocompromised  patients,  whose  workup  requires 
an entirely different diagnostic and therapeutic approach. For optimal 
comparison of patients with FUO in different geographic areas, it has 
been proposed that the quantitative criterion (diagnosis uncertain after 
1 week of evaluation) be changed to a qualitative criterion that requires 
the performance of a specific list of investigations. Accordingly, FUO 
is now defined as follows:

1.  Fever ≥38.3°C (≥101°F) on at least two occasions
2.  Illness duration of ≥3 weeks
3.  No known immunocompromised state
4.  Diagnosis  that  remains  uncertain  after  a  thorough  history-taking, 
physical  examination,  and  the  following  obligatory  investigations: 
determination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive 
protein (CRP) level; platelet count; leukocyte count and differential; 
measurement of levels of hemoglobin, electrolytes, creatinine, total 
protein,  alkaline  phosphatase,  alanine  aminotransferase,  aspartate 
aminotransferase,  lactate  dehydrogenase,  creatine  kinase,  ferritin, 
antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor; protein electropho-
resis; urinalysis; blood cultures (n = 3); urine culture; chest x-ray; 
abdominal ultrasonography; and tuberculin skin test (TST) or inter-
feron γ release assay (IGRA).

Closely  related  to  FUO  is  inflammation  of  unknown  origin  (IUO), 
which has the same definition as FUO, except for the body temperature

criterion:  IUO  is  defined  as  the  presence  of  elevated  inflammatory 
parameters (CRP or ESR) on multiple occasions for a period of at least 
3  weeks  in  an  immunocompetent  patient  with  normal  body  temper-
ature,  for  which  a  final  explanation  is  lacking  despite  history-taking, 
physical examination, and the obligatory tests listed above. It has been 
shown that the causes and workup for IUO are the same as for FUO. 
Therefore, for convenience, the term FUO will refer to both FUO and 
IUO within the remainder of this chapter.

 ■ ETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Table 20-1 summarizes the findings of large studies on FUO conducted 
over the past 20 years.

The  range  of  FUO  etiologies  has  evolved  since  its  first  definition 
as  a  result  of  changes  in  the  spectrum  of  diseases  causing  FUO,  the 
widespread  use  of  antibiotics,  and  especially  the  availability  of  new 
diagnostic techniques. The proportion of cases caused by intraabdom-
inal abscesses and tumors, for example, has decreased because of earlier 
detection  by  CT  and  ultrasound.  In  addition,  infective  endocarditis 
is a less frequent cause because blood culture and echocardiographic 
techniques have improved. Conversely, some diagnoses such as acute 
HIV infection were unknown six decades ago.

Roughly  comparable  to  60  years  ago,  in  non-Western  cohorts 
infections remain the most common cause of FUO. Up to half of all 
infections  in  patients  with  FUO  outside  Western  nations  are  caused 
by  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis,  which  is  a  less  common  cause  in 
Western  Europe  and  probably  also  in  the  United  States.  Recent  data 
from the latter, however, have not been reported. In Western cohorts, 
noninfectious inflammatory diseases (NIIDs), including autoimmune, 
autoinflammatory, and granulomatous diseases, as well as vasculitides, 
form the most common cause of FUO. More than one-third of Western 
patients  with  FUO  have  a  diagnosis  that  falls  within  the  category  of 
NIIDs. The number of FUO patients diagnosed with NIIDs probably 
will not decrease in the near future, as fever may precede more typical 
manifestations  or  laboratory  evidence  of  these  diseases  by  months. 
Moreover, many NIIDs can be diagnosed only after prolonged obser-
vation and exclusion of other diseases.

In  Western  cohorts,  FUO  remains  unexplained  in  more  than  one-
third of patients. This is much higher than 60 years ago. This difference 
can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  in  patients  with  fever  a  diagnosis  
is  often  established  before  3  weeks  have  elapsed  because  these  patients 
tend to seek medical advice earlier, and because better diagnostic tech-
niques, such as CT, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, 
are now available. Therefore, only the cases that are most difficult to diag-
nose continue to meet the criteria for FUO. Furthermore, most patients 
who have FUO without a diagnosis currently do well. A less aggressive 
diagnostic approach may be used in clinically stable patients once diseases 
with immediate therapeutic or prognostic consequences have been ruled 
out. In patients with recurrent fever (defined as repeated episodes of fever

remission of the underlying disease), the chance of attaining an etiologic 
diagnosis is <50%.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The  differential  diagnosis  for  FUO  is  extensive.  It  is  important  to 
remember that FUO is far more often caused by an atypical presenta-
tion of a rather common disease than by a very rare disease. Table 20-2 
presents an overview of possible causes of FUO. Atypical presentations 
of endocarditis, diverticulitis, vertebral osteomyelitis, and extrapulmo-
nary tuberculosis are the more common infectious disease diagnoses. 

Q  fever  and  Whipple’s  disease  (Tropheryma  whipplei  infection)  are 
quite rare but should always be kept in mind as a cause of FUO since 
the  presenting  symptoms  can  be  nonspecific.  Serologic  testing  for  Q 
fever,  which  results  from  exposure  to  animals  or  animal  products, 
should  be  performed  by  immunofluorescence  assay  (IFA)  when  the 
patient lives in a rural area or has a history of heart valve disease, an 
aortic aneurysm, or a vascular prosthesis. In patients with unexplained 
symptoms  localized  to  the  central  nervous  system,  gastrointestinal 
tract,  or  joints,  polymerase  chain  reaction  testing  for  Tropheryma 
whipplei should be performed. Travel to or (former) residence in trop-
ical countries or the American Southwest should lead to consideration

of  infectious  diseases  such  as  malaria,  leishmaniasis,  histoplasmosis, 
or  coccidioidomycosis.  Fever  with  signs  of  endocarditis  and  nega-
tive  blood  culture  results  poses  a  special  problem.  Culture-negative 
endocarditis  (Chap.  128)  may  be  due  to  difficult-to-culture  bacteria 
such  as  nutritionally  variant  bacteria,  HACEK  organisms  (including 
Haemophilus  parainfluenzae,  H.  paraphrophilus,  Aggregatibacter  acti-
nomycetemcomitans,  A.  aphrophilus,  A.  paraphrophilus,  Cardiobacte-
rium  hominis,  C.  valvarum,  Eikenella  corrodens,  and  Kingella  kingae; 
discussed below), Coxiella burnetii, T. whipplei, and Bartonella species. 
Marantic endocarditis is a sterile thrombotic disease that occurs as a 
paraneoplastic phenomenon, especially with adenocarcinomas. Sterile 
endocarditis is also seen in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus 
and antiphospholipid syndrome.

Of the NIIDs, adult-onset Still’s disease, large-vessel vasculitis, polymy-
algia rheumatica, systemic lupus erythematodus (SLE), and sarcoidosis 
are rather common diagnoses in patients with FUO. The hereditary auto-
inflammatory  syndromes  are  very  rare  (with  the  exception  of  familial 
Mediterranean fever in specific geographic regions) and usually present 
in young patients. Schnitzler syndrome, which can present at any age, is 
uncommon but can often be diagnosed easily in a patient with FUO who 
presents with urticaria, bone pain, and monoclonal gammopathy.

Although most tumors can present with fever, malignant lymphoma 
is by far the most common diagnosis of FUO among the neoplasms. 
Sometimes  the  fever  even  precedes  lymphadenopathy  detectable  by 
physical examination.

Apart from drug-induced fever and exercise-induced hyperthermia, 
none of the miscellaneous causes of fever is found very frequently in 
patients with FUO. Virtually all drugs can cause fever, even after long-
term  use.  Drug-induced  fever,  including  DRESS  (drug  reaction  with 
eosinophilia  and  systemic  symptoms;  Fig.  A1-48),  is  often  accom-
panied  by  eosinophilia  and  also  by  lymphadenopathy,  which  can  be 
extensive. More common causes of drug-induced fever are allopurinol, 
carbamazepine,  lamotrigine,  phenytoin,  sulfasalazine,  furosemide, 
antimicrobial drugs (especially sulfonamides, minocycline, vancomy-
cin,  β-lactam  antibiotics,  and  isoniazid),  some  cardiovascular  drugs 
(e.g.,  quinidine),  and  some  antiretroviral  drugs  (e.g.,  nevirapine). 
Exercise-induced  hyperthermia  (Chaps.  18  and  465)  is  characterized 
by  an  elevated  body  temperature  that  is  associated  with  moderate  to 
strenuous exercise lasting from half an hour up to several hours with-
out an increase in CRP level or ESR. Unlike patients with fever, these 
patients  typically  sweat  during  the  temperature  elevation.  Factitious 
fever  (fever  artificially  induced  by  the  patient—for  example,  by  IV 
injection of contaminated water) should be considered in all patients 
but is more common among young women in health-care professions. 
In  fraudulent  fever,  the  patient  is  normothermic  but  manipulates  the 
thermometer. Simultaneous measurements at different body sites (rec-
tum, ear, mouth) should rapidly identify this diagnosis. Another clue 
to fraudulent fever is dissociation between pulse rate and temperature.
Previous studies of FUO have shown that a cause is more likely to 
be found in elderly patients than in younger age groups. In many cases, 
FUO in the elderly results from an atypical manifestation of a common 
disease, among which giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica 
are most frequently involved. Tuberculosis is the most common infec-
tious disease associated with FUO in elderly patients, occurring much 
more  often  than  in  younger  patients.  As  many  of  these  diseases  are 
treatable, it is well worth pursuing the cause of fever in elderly patients.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Fever of Unknown Origin 

FIRST-STAGE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
Figure  20-1  shows  a  structured  approach  to  patients  presenting 
with  FUO.  The  most  important  step  in  the  diagnostic  workup  is 
the  search  for  potentially  diagnostic  clues  (PDCs)  through  com-
plete  and  repeated  history-taking  and  physical  examination  and 
the  obligatory  investigations  listed  above  and  in  the  figure.  PDCs 
are  defined  as  all  localizing  signs,  symptoms,  and  abnormalities 

potentially pointing toward a diagnosis. Although PDCs are often 
misleading,  only  with  their  help  can  a  concise  list  of  probable 
diagnoses be made. The history should include information about 
the fever pattern (continuous or recurrent) and duration, previous 
medical history, present and recent drug use, family history, sexual 
history, country of origin, recent and remote travel, unusual envi-
ronmental exposures associated with travel or hobbies, and animal 
contacts. A complete physical examination should be performed, 
with special attention to the eyes, lymph nodes, temporal arteries, 
liver,  spleen,  sites  of  previous  surgery,  entire  skin  surface,  and 
mucous  membranes.  Before  further  diagnostic  tests  are  initiated, 
antibiotic and glucocorticoid treatment, which can mask many dis-
eases, should be stopped. For example, blood and other cultures are 
not reliable when samples are obtained during antibiotic treatment, 
and  the  size  of  enlarged  lymph  nodes  usually  decreases  during 
glucocorticoid  treatment,  regardless  of  the  cause  of  lymphade-
nopathy. Despite the high percentage of false-positive ultrasounds 
and the relatively low sensitivity of chest x-rays, the performance 
of these simple, low-cost diagnostic tests remains obligatory in all 
patients  with  FUO  in  order  to  separate  cases  that  are  caused  by 
easily diagnosed diseases from those that are not. Abdominal ultra-
sound is preferred to abdominal CT as an obligatory test because 
of relatively low cost, lack of radiation burden, and absence of side  
effects.

Only  rarely  do  biochemical  tests  (beyond  the  obligatory  tests 
needed to classify a patient’s fever as FUO) lead directly to a defin-
itive  diagnosis  in  the  absence  of  PDCs.  The  diagnostic  yield  of 
immunologic  serology  other  than  that  included  in  the  obligatory 
tests  is  relatively  low.  These  tests  more  often  yield  false-positive 
rather than true-positive results and are of little use without PDCs 
pointing to specific immunologic disorders. Given the absence of 
specific symptoms in many patients and the relatively low cost of 
the  test,  investigation  of  cryoglobulins  appears  to  be  a  valuable 
screening test in patients with FUO.

Multiple blood samples should be cultured in the laboratory long 
enough to ensure ample growth time for any fastidious organisms, 
such as HACEK organisms. It is critical to inform the laboratory of 
the intent to test for unusual organisms. Specialized media should be 
used when the history suggests uncommon microorganisms, such 
as Histoplasma or Legionella. Performing more than three blood cul-
tures or more than one urine culture is useless in patients with FUO 
in  the  absence  of  PDCs  (e.g.,  a  high  level  of  clinical  suspicion  of 
endocarditis). Repeating blood or urine cultures is useful only when 
previously cultured samples were collected during antibiotic treat-
ment or within 1 week after its discontinuation. FUO with headache 
should  prompt  microbiologic  examination  of  cerebrospinal  fluid 
(CSF) for organisms including herpes simplex virus (especially type 
2),  Cryptococcus  neoformans,  and  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis.  In 
central nervous system tuberculosis, the CSF typically has elevated 
protein  and  lowered  glucose  concentrations,  with  a  mononuclear 
pleocytosis. CSF protein levels range from 100 to 500 mg/dL in most 
patients,  the  CSF  glucose  concentration  is  <45  mg/dL  in  80%  of 
cases, and the usual CSF cell count is between 100 and 500 cells/μL.
Microbiologic  serology  should  not  be  included  in  the  diag-
nostic  workup  of  patients  without  PDCs  for  specific  infections. 
A  tuberculin  skin  test  (TST)  or  interferon  γ  release  assay  (IGRA, 
QuantiFERON test) is included in the obligatory investigations, but 
it may yield false-negative results in patients with miliary tubercu-
losis, malnutrition, or immunosuppression. Although the IGRA is 
less  influenced  by  prior  vaccination  with  bacille  Calmette-Guérin 
(BCG) or by infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria, its sensi-
tivity is similar to that of the TST; a negative TST or IGRA therefore 
does  not  exclude  a  diagnosis  of  tuberculosis.  Miliary  tuberculosis 
is  especially  difficult  to  diagnose.  Granulomatous  disease  in  liver 
or  bone  marrow  biopsy  samples,  for  example,  should  always  lead 
to  a  (re)consideration  of  this  diagnosis.  If  miliary  tuberculosis 
is  suspected,  liver  biopsy  for  acid-fast  smear,  culture,  and  poly-
merase chain reaction probably still has the highest diagnostic yield;

however, biopsies of bone marrow, lymph nodes, or other involved 
organs also can be considered.

The  diagnostic  yield  of  echocardiography,  sinus  radiography, 
radiologic  or  endoscopic  evaluation  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract, 
and bronchoscopy is very low in the absence of PDCs. Therefore, 
these tests should not be used as screening procedures.

After identification of all PDCs retrieved from the history, phys-
ical  examination,  and  obligatory  tests,  a  limited  list  of  the  most 
probable diagnoses should be made. Since most investigations are 

helpful only for patients who have PDCs for the diagnoses sought, 
further diagnostic procedures should be limited to specific inves-
tigations aimed at confirming or excluding diseases on this list. In 
FUO,  the  diagnostic  pointers  are  numerous  and  diverse  but  may 
be  missed  on  initial  examination,  often  being  detected  only  by  a 
very  careful  examination  performed  subsequently.  In  the  absence 
of  PDCs,  the  history  and  physical  examination  should  therefore 
be repeated regularly. One of the first steps should be to rule out 
factitious or fraudulent fever, particularly in patients without signs

nonprescription drugs and nutritional supplements, should be dis-
continued  early  in  the  evaluation  to  exclude  drug  fever.  If  fever 
persists  beyond  72  h  after  discontinuation  of  the  suspected  drug, 
it is unlikely that this drug is the cause. In patients without PDCs

may be useful in the early stage of the diagnostic workup to exclude 
retinal vasculitis. When the first-stage diagnostic tests do not lead 
to a diagnosis, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission 
tomography  combined  with  computed  tomography  (PET/CT)  or, 
if  the  former  is  not  available,  radiolabeled  leukocyte  scintigraphy 
should be performed, especially when the ESR or the CRP level is 
elevated. 
Recurrent  Fever 
In  patients  with  recurrent  fever,  the  diagnostic 
workup  should  consist  of  thorough  history-taking,  physical  exami-
nation, and obligatory tests. The search for PDCs should be directed 
toward  clues  matching  known  recurrent  syndromes  (Table  20-3). 
Patients should be asked to return during a febrile episode so that the 
history,  physical  examination,  and  laboratory  tests  can  be  repeated 
during a symptomatic phase. Further diagnostic tests, such as PET/CT 
or scintigraphic imaging (see below), should be performed only dur-
ing a febrile episode or when inflammatory parameters are abnormal 
because abnormalities may be absent between episodes. In patients 
with recurrent fever lasting >2 years, it is very unlikely that the fever 
is caused by infection or malignancy. Further diagnostic tests in that 

direction should be considered only when PDCs for infections, vas-
culitis syndromes, or malignancy are present or when the patient’s 
clinical condition is deteriorating. 
Fluorodeoxyglucose  Positron  Emission  Tomography 
18F-FDG 
PET/CT  has  become  an  established  imaging  procedure  in  FUO. 
FDG  accumulates  in  tissues  with  a  high  rate  of  glycolysis,  which 
occurs not only in malignant cells but also in activated leukocytes 
and thus permits the imaging of acute and chronic inflammatory 
processes.  Compared  with  conventional  scintigraphy  (see  below), 
FDG-PET/CT  offers  the  advantages  of  higher  resolution,  greater 
sensitivity  in  chronic  low-grade  infections,  and  a  high  degree  of 
accuracy  in  the  central  skeleton.  Furthermore,  vascular  uptake  of 
FDG is increased in patients with vasculitis (Fig. 20-2). The mech-
anisms  responsible  for  FDG  uptake  do  not  allow  differentiation 
among  infection,  sterile  inflammation,  and  malignancy.  However, 
since  all  of  these  disorders  are  causes  of  FUO,  FDG-PET/CT  can 
be used to guide additional diagnostic tests (e.g., targeted biopsies) 
that  may  yield  the  final  diagnosis.  It  is  important  to  realize  that 
physiologic  uptake  of  FDG  may  obscure  pathologic  foci  in  the 
brain, heart, bowel, kidneys, and bladder. FDG uptake in the heart, 
which obscures endocarditis, may be prevented by consumption of 
a  low-carbohydrate  diet  before  the  PET  investigation.  In  patients 
with fever, bone marrow uptake is frequently increased in a non-
specific way due to cytokine activation, which upregulates glucose 
transporters in bone marrow cells.

FIGURE 20-2  FDG-PET/CT in a patient with FUO. This 72-year-old woman presented with a low-grade fever and severe fatigue of almost 3 months’ duration. An extensive 
history was taken, but the patient had no specific complaints and had not traveled recently. Her previous history was unremarkable, and she did not use any drugs. Physical 
examination, including palpation of the temporal arteries, yielded completely normal results. Laboratory examination showed normocytic anemia, a C-reactive protein level 
of 43 mg/L, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 87 mm/h, and mild hypoalbuminemia. Results of the other obligatory tests were all normal. Since there were no potentially 
diagnostic clues, FDG-PET/CT was performed. This test showed increased FDG uptake in all major arteries (carotid, jugular, and subclavian arteries; thoracic and abdominal 
aorta; iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries) and in the soft tissue around the shoulders, hips, and knees—findings compatible with large-vessel vasculitis and polymyalgia 
rheumatica. Within 1 week after the initiation of treatment with prednisone (60 mg once daily), the patient completely recovered. After 1 month, the prednisone dose was 
slowly tapered. 

In recent years, many cohort studies and several meta-analyses 
have focused on the diagnostic yield of PET and PET/CT in FUO. 
These studies are highly variable in terms of the selection of patients, 
the follow-up, and the selection of a gold-standard reference. Indi-
rect comparisons of test performance suggested that FDG-PET/CT 
outperformed stand-alone FDG-PET, gallium scintigraphy, and leu-
kocyte  scintigraphy.  Similarly,  indirect  comparisons  of  diagnostic 
yield suggested that FDG-PET/CT was more likely than alternative 
tests to correctly identify the cause of FUO. Meta-analyses report a 
high diagnostic yield for PET and PET/CT in the workup of FUO 
patients, with pooled sensitivity and specificity figures of ~85% and 
~50%, respectively, and a total diagnostic yield of ~50% for PET/
CT and ~40% for PET.

As many patients with FUO present with periodic fever, correct 
timing of PET/CT increases its diagnostic value. Few studies on the 
use of biomarkers such as elevated CRP or ESR for a contributory 
outcome  of  PET/CT  have  been  performed.  When  both  CRP  and 
ESR are normal at the time of FDG-PET/CT, outcome may only be 
contributory when a patient does have fever at the time of the scan.
Although  PET/CT  and  other  scintigraphic  techniques  do  not 
directly provide a definitive diagnosis (with the exception of some 
patients with, for instance, large vessel vasculitis), they often iden-
tify  the  anatomic  location  of  a  particular  ongoing  metabolic  pro-
cess. With the help of other techniques such as biopsy and culture, 
a timely diagnosis and treatment can be facilitated. Pathologic FDG 
uptake  is  quickly  eradicated  by  treatment  with  glucocorticoids  in 
many diseases, including vasculitis and lymphoma; therefore, glu-
cocorticoid use should be stopped or postponed until after FDG-
PET/CT is performed.

FDG-PET/CT  is  a  relatively  expensive  procedure  whose  avail-
ability is still limited compared with that of CT and conventional 
scintigraphy.  Nevertheless,  FDG-PET/CT  can  be  cost-effective  in 
the  FUO  diagnostic  workup  if  used  at  an  early  stage,  helping  to 

establish  an  early  diagnosis,  reducing  days  of  hospitalization  for 
diagnostic  purposes,  and  obviating  unnecessary  and  unhelpful 
tests. When FDG-PET/CT has been made under the right condi-
tions (i.e., when elevated CRP or ESR or fever were present during 
the scan) but has not contributed to the final diagnosis, repeating 
PET/CT is probably of little value, unless new signs or symptoms 
appear. 

than  PET/CT   

imaging  other 

Conventional  scintigraphic 
Conventional  scintigraphic  methods  used  in  clinical  practice  are 
67Ga-citrate scintigraphy and 111In- or 99mTc-labeled leukocyte scin-
tigraphy.  Sensitivity  and  specificity  of  conventional  scintigraphic 
studies are lower than for PET/CT: the diagnostic yield of gallium 
scintigraphy ranges from 21% to 54%, and on average the location 
of a source of fever can correctly be localized in approximately one-
third  of  patients.  The  diagnostic  value  of  leukocyte  scintigraphy 
ranges from 8% to 31%, and overall the cause of FUO can correctly 
be identified in one-fifth of patients. When PET/CT is not available, 
these techniques are the only alternative. 

LATER-STAGE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
In  some  cases,  more  invasive  tests  are  appropriate.  Abnormalities 
found with imaging often need to be confirmed by pathology and/
or culture of biopsy specimens. If lymphadenopathy is found, lymph 
node biopsy is necessary, even when the affected lymph nodes are 
hard to reach or when previous biopsies were inconclusive. In the 
case of skin lesions, skin biopsy should be undertaken.

If  no  diagnosis  is  reached  despite  PET/CT  and  PDC-driven 
histologic  investigations  or  culture,  second-stage  screening  diag-
nostic tests should be considered (Fig. 20-1). In three studies, the 
diagnostic  yield  of  screening  chest  and  abdominal  CT  in  patients 
with  FUO  was  ~20%.  The  specificity  of  chest  CT  was  ~80%,  but 
that  of  abdominal  CT  varied  between  63%  and  80%.  Despite  the 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   150

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesrelatively limited specificity of abdominal CT and the probably lim-
ited additional value of chest CT after normal FDG-PET/CT, chest 
and abdominal CT may be used as screening procedures at a later 
stage of the diagnostic protocol because of their noninvasive nature 
and  high  sensitivity.  Bone  marrow  aspiration  is  seldom  useful  in 
the absence of PDCs for bone marrow disorders. With addition of 
FDG-PET/CT,  which  is  highly  sensitive  in  detecting  lymphoma, 
carcinoma, and osteomyelitis, the value of bone marrow biopsy as 
a screening procedure is probably further reduced. Several studies 
have shown a high prevalence of giant cell arteritis among patients 
with FUO, with rates up to 17% among elderly patients. Giant cell 
arteritis often involves large arteries and in most cases can be diag-
nosed  by  FDG-PET/CT.  However,  temporal  artery  biopsy  is  still 
recommended for patients ≥55 years of age in a later stage of the 
diagnostic  protocol:  FDG-PET/CT  will  not  be  useful  in  vasculitis 
limited  to  the  temporal  arteries  because  of  the  small  diameter  of 
these vessels and the high levels of FDG uptake in the brain. In the 
past, liver biopsies were often performed as a screening procedure 
in  patients  with  FUO.  In  each  of  two  studies,  liver  biopsy  as  part 
of the later stage of a screening diagnostic protocol was helpful in 
only one patient. Moreover, abnormal liver tests are not predictive 
of a diagnostic liver biopsy in FUO. Liver biopsy is an invasive pro-
cedure that carries the possibility of complications and even death. 
Therefore, it should not be used for screening purposes in patients 
with  FUO  except  in  those  with  PDCs  for  liver  disease  or  miliary 
tuberculosis.

In patients with unexplained fever after all of the above proce-
dures, the last steps in the diagnostic workup—with only a marginal 
diagnostic  yield—come  at  an  extraordinarily  high  cost  in  terms 
of  both  expense  and  discomfort  for  the  patient.  Repetition  of  a 
thorough  history-taking  and  physical  examination  and  review  of 
laboratory results and imaging studies (including those from other 
hospitals)  are  recommended.  Diagnostic  delay  often  results  from 
a failure to recognize PDCs in the available information. In these 
patients  with  persisting  FUO,  waiting  for  new  PDCs  to  appear 
probably  is  better  than  ordering  more  screening  investigations. 
Only when a patient’s condition deteriorates without providing new 
PDCs should a further diagnostic workup be performed. 

SECOND OPINION IN AN EXPERT CENTER
When despite the workup described above no explanation for FUO 
is  found,  second  opinion  in  an  expert  center  on  FUO  should  be 
considered.  The  single  study  on  the  value  of  second  opinion  in 
FUO reported that in 57.3% of patients with unexplained FUO, a 
diagnosis  could  be  found  in  an  expert  center.  Additionally,  of  all 
patients who remained without a diagnosis even after second opin-
ion, 10.9% became fever-free upon empirical treatment, adding up 
to a beneficial outcome in 68.2% of patients.

a  rapid  diagnosis.  If  the  fever  does  not  respond  after  6  weeks  of 
empirical  antituberculous  treatment,  another  diagnosis  should  be 
considered. 
COLCHICINE, NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY 
DRUGS, AND GLUCOCORTICOIDS
Colchicine is highly effective in preventing attacks of familial Med-
iterranean fever (FMF) but is not always effective once an attack is 
well under way. When FMF is suspected, the response to colchicine 
is not a completely reliable diagnostic tool in the acute phase, but 
with colchicine treatment most patients show remarkable improve-
ments in the frequency and severity of subsequent febrile episodes 
within  weeks  to  months.  Therefore,  colchicine  may  be  tried  in 
patients with features compatible with FMF, especially when these 
patients originate from a high-prevalence region.

If  the  fever  persists  and  the  source  remains  elusive  after  com-
pletion of the later-stage investigations, supportive treatment with 
nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  can  be  helpful. 
The  response  of  adult-onset  Still’s  disease  to  NSAIDs  is  dramatic 
in some cases.

The effects of glucocorticoids on giant cell arteritis and polymy-
algia rheumatica are equally impressive. Early empirical trials with 
glucocorticoids, however, decrease the chances of reaching a diag-
nosis for which more specific and sometimes life-saving treatment 
might be more appropriate, such as malignant lymphoma. The abil-
ity of NSAIDs and glucocorticoids to mask fever while permitting 
the spread of infection or lymphoma dictates that their use should 
be  avoided  unless  infectious  diseases  and  malignant  lymphoma 
have been largely ruled out and inflammatory disease is probable 
and is likely to be debilitating or threatening. 

INTERLEUKIN 1 INHIBITION
Interleukin  (IL)  1  is  a  key  cytokine  in  local  and  systemic  inflam-
mation  and  the  febrile  response.  The  availability  of  specific  IL-1- 
targeting  agents  has  revealed  a  pathologic  role  of  IL-1-mediated 
inflammation in a growing list of diseases. Anakinra, a recombinant 
form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), 
blocks the activity of both IL-1α and IL-1β. Anakinra is extremely 
effective  in  the  treatment  of  many  autoinflammatory  syndromes, 
such  as  FMF,  cryopyrin-associated  periodic  syndrome,  tumor 
necrosis factor receptor–associated periodic syndrome, mevalonate 
kinase deficiency (hyper IgD syndrome), Schnitzler syndrome, and 
adult  onset  Still’s  disease.  There  are  many  other  chronic  inflam-
matory disorders in which anti-IL-1 therapy is highly effective. A 
therapeutic trial with anakinra can be considered in patients whose 
FUO  has  not  been  diagnosed  after  later-stage  diagnostic  tests. 
Although most chronic inflammatory conditions without a known 
basis  can  be  controlled  with  glucocorticoids,  monotherapy  with 
IL-1 blockade can provide improved control without the metabolic, 
immunologic,  and  gastrointestinal  side  effects  of  glucocorticoid 
administration.

TREATMENT
Fever of Unknown Origin

Empirical  therapeutic  trials  with  antibiotics,  glucocorticoids,  or 
antituberculous  agents  should  be  avoided  in  FUO  except  when  a 
patient’s condition is rapidly deteriorating after the aforementioned 
diagnostic tests have failed to provide a definite diagnosis. 

ANTIBIOTICS AND ANTITUBERCULOUS THERAPY
Antibiotic  or  antituberculous  therapy  may  irrevocably  diminish 
the ability to culture fastidious bacteria or mycobacteria. However, 
hemodynamic  instability  or  neutropenia  is  a  good  indication  for 
empirical  antibiotic  therapy.  If  the  TST  or  IGRA  is  positive  or 
if  granulomatous  disease  is  present  with  anergy  and  sarcoidosis 
seems unlikely, a trial of therapy for tuberculosis should be started. 
Especially in miliary tuberculosis, it may be very difficult to obtain 

 ■ PROGNOSIS
In  patients  in  whom  FUO  remains  unexplained,  prognosis  is  favorable. 
Two  large  studies  on  mortality  in  these  patients  have  been  performed. 
The  first  study  included  436  patients  of  whom  168  remained  without 
a  diagnosis.  Of  these,  4  (2.4%)  died  during  follow-up.  All  4  patients 
died  during  the  index  admission,  and  in  2  of  them  a  diagnosis  was 
made upon autopsy (1 had intravascular lymphoma and 1 had bilateral 
pneumonia).  The  second  study  included  131  patients  with  unexplained 
FUO.  Of  these  patients,  9  (6.9%)  died  during  a  median  follow-up  of  
5  years.  In  6  of  these  patients  the  cause  of  death  was  known,  and  in  5 
of  them  death  was  considered  unrelated  to  the  febrile  disease.  Overall, 
FUO-related  mortality  rates  have  continuously  declined  over  recent 
decades. The majority of fevers are caused by treatable diseases, and the 
risk of death related to FUO is, of course, dependent on the underlying 
disease.

Section 3  Nervous System Dysfunction

21 Syncope

Roy Freeman

Syncope is a transient, self-limited loss of consciousness due to acute 
global impairment of cerebral blood flow. The onset is rapid, duration 
brief, and recovery spontaneous and complete. Other causes of tran-
sient  loss  of  consciousness  need  to  be  distinguished  from  syncope; 
these include seizures, vertebrobasilar ischemia, hypoxemia, and hypo-
glycemia. A syncopal prodrome (presyncope) is common, although loss 
of consciousness may occur without any warning symptoms. Typical 
presyncopal symptoms include lightheadedness or faintness, dizziness, 
weakness, fatigue, and visual and auditory disturbances. The causes of 
syncope can be divided into three general categories: (1) neurally medi-
ated  syncope  (also  called  reflex  or  vasovagal  syncope),  (2)  orthostatic 
hypotension, and (3) cardiac syncope.

Neurally  mediated  syncope  comprises  a  heterogeneous  group  of 
functional  disorders  that  are  characterized  by  a  transient  change  in 
the  reflexes  responsible  for  maintaining  cardiovascular  homeostasis. 
Episodic vasodilation (or loss of vasoconstrictor tone), decreased car-
diac output, and bradycardia occur in varying combinations, resulting 
in temporary failure of blood pressure control. In contrast, in patients 
with orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure, these cardiovas-
cular homeostatic reflexes are chronically impaired. Cardiac syncope 
may  be  due  to  arrhythmias  or  structural  cardiac  diseases  that  cause 
a decrease in cardiac output. The clinical features, underlying patho-
physiologic  mechanisms,  therapeutic  interventions,  and  prognoses 
differ markedly among these three causes.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY
Syncope is a common presenting problem, accounting for ~3% of all 
emergency department (ED) visits and 1% of all hospital admissions. 
The annual cost for syncope-related hospitalization in the United States 
is ~$2.4 billion. Syncope has a lifetime cumulative incidence of up to 
35% in the general population. The peak incidence in the young occurs 
between  ages  10  and  30  years,  with  a  median  peak  around  15  years. 
Neurally mediated syncope is the etiology in the vast majority of these 
cases. In older adults, there is a sharp rise in the incidence of syncope 
after 70 years of age.

In population-based studies, neurally mediated syncope is the most 
common  cause  of  syncope.  The  incidence  is  higher  in  women  than 
men. In young subjects, there is often a family history in first-degree 
relatives. Cardiovascular disease due to structural disease or arrhyth-
mias is the next most common cause in most series, particularly in ED

settings and in older patients. Orthostatic hypotension also increases in 
prevalence with age because of the reduced baroreflex responsiveness, 
decreased cardiac compliance, and attenuation of the vestibulosympa-
thetic reflex associated with aging. Other contributors are reduced fluid 
intake and vasoactive medications, also more likely in this age group. 
In the elderly, orthostatic hypotension is more common in institution-
alized than community-dwelling individuals, most likely explained by 
a greater prevalence of predisposing neurologic disorders, physiologic 
impairment,  and  vasoactive  medication  use  among  institutionalized 
patients.

Syncope  of  noncardiac  and  unexplained  origin  in  younger  indi-
viduals  has  an  excellent  prognosis;  life  expectancy  is  unaffected.  By 
contrast, syncope due to a cardiac cause, either structural heart disease 
or a primary arrhythmic disorder, is associated with an increased risk 
of sudden cardiac death and mortality from other causes. Similarly, the 
mortality rate is increased in individuals with syncope due to ortho-
static hypotension related to age and the associated comorbid condi-
tions (Table 21-1). The likelihood of hospitalization and mortality risk 
are higher in older adults.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The upright posture imposes a unique physiologic stress upon humans; 
most,  although  not  all,  syncopal  episodes  occur  from  a  standing 
position. Standing results in pooling of 500–1000 mL of blood in the 
lower extremities, buttocks, and splanchnic circulation. The dependent 
pooling leads to a decrease in venous return to the heart and reduced 
ventricular filling that result in diminished cardiac output and blood 
pressure. These hemodynamic changes provoke a compensatory reflex 
response, initiated by the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic 
arch, resulting in increased sympathetic outflow and decreased vagal 
nerve  activity  (Fig.  21-1).  The  reflex  increases  peripheral  resistance, 
venous return to the heart, and cardiac output and thus limits the fall 
in  blood  pressure.  If  this  response  fails,  as  is  the  case  chronically  in 
orthostatic hypotension and transiently in neurally mediated syncope, 
hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion occur.

Syncope is a consequence of global cerebral hypoperfusion and thus 
represents a failure of cerebral blood flow autoregulatory mechanisms. 
Myogenic factors, local metabolites, and to a lesser extent autonomic 
neurovascular control are responsible for the autoregulation of cerebral 
blood flow (Chap. 307). The latency of the autoregulatory response is 
5–10 s. Typically, cerebral blood flow ranges from 50–60 mL/min per 
100 g brain tissue and remains relatively constant over perfusion pres-
sures ranging from 50–150 mmHg. Cessation of blood flow for 6–8 s

FIGURE 21-1  The baroreflex. A decrease in arterial pressure unloads the baroreceptors—the terminals of afferent fibers of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves—that are 
situated in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. This leads to a reduction in the afferent impulses that are relayed from these mechanoreceptors through the glossopharyngeal 
and vagus nerves to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) in the dorsomedial medulla. The reduced baroreceptor afferent activity produces a decrease in vagal nerve 
input to the sinus node that is mediated via connections of the NTS to the nucleus ambiguus (NA). There is an increase in sympathetic efferent activity that is mediated by 
the NTS projections to the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) (an excitatory pathway) and from there to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) (an inhibitory pathway). 
The activation of RVLM presympathetic neurons in response to hypotension is thus predominantly due to disinhibition. In response to a sustained fall in blood pressure, 
vasopressin  release  is  mediated  by  projections  from  the  A1  noradrenergic  cell  group  in  the  ventrolateral  medulla.  This  projection  activates  vasopressin-synthesizing 
neurons in the magnocellular portion of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus. Blue denotes sympathetic neurons, and 
green denotes parasympathetic neurons. (From R Freeman: Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. N Engl J Med 358:615, 2008. Copyright © 2008 Massachusetts Medical

will result in loss of consciousness, while impairment of consciousness 
ensues when blood flow decreases to 25 mL/min per 100 g brain tissue.
From  the  clinical  standpoint,  a  fall  in  systemic  systolic  blood 
pressure to ~50 mmHg or lower will result in syncope. A decrease in 
cardiac output and/or systemic vascular resistance—the determinants 
of  blood  pressure—thus  underlies  the  pathophysiology  of  syncope. 
Common  causes  of  impaired  cardiac  output  include  decreased  effec-
tive  circulating  blood  volume,  increased  thoracic  pressure,  massive 
pulmonary  embolus,  cardiac  brady-  and  tachyarrhythmias,  valvular 
heart  disease,  and  myocardial  dysfunction.  Systemic  vascular  resis-
tance may be decreased by central and peripheral autonomic nervous 
system  diseases,  sympatholytic  medications,  and  transiently  during 
neurally  mediated  syncope.  Increased  cerebral  vascular  resistance, 
most frequently due to hypocarbia induced by hyperventilation, may 
also contribute to the pathophysiology of syncope.

Two  patterns  of  electroencephalographic  (EEG)  changes  occur  in 
syncopal  subjects.  The  first  is  a  “slow-flat-slow”  pattern  (Fig.  21-2) 
in which normal background activity is replaced with high-amplitude 
slow delta waves. This is followed by sudden flattening of the EEG—a 
cessation or attenuation of cortical activity—followed by the return of 
slow waves, and then normal activity. A second pattern, the “slow pat-
tern,” is characterized by increasing and decreasing slow wave activity 
only. The EEG flattening that occurs in the slow-flat-slow pattern is a 
marker of more severe cerebral hypoperfusion. Despite the presence of 
myoclonic movements and other motor activity during some syncopal 
events, EEG seizure discharges are not detected.

CLASSIFICATION
 ■ NEURALLY MEDIATED SYNCOPE
Neurally  mediated  (reflex;  vasovagal)  syncope  is  the  final  pathway 
of a complex central and peripheral nervous system reflex arc. There 
is  a  transient  change  in  autonomic  efferent  activity  with  increased 
parasympathetic outflow, plus sympathoinhibition, resulting in brady-
cardia,  vasodilation,  and/or  reduced  vasoconstrictor  tone  (the  vaso-
depressor response) and reduced cardiac output. The resulting fall in 
systemic blood pressure can then reduce cerebral blood flow to below 
the  compensatory  limits  of  autoregulation  (Fig.  21-3).  In  order  to 
develop neurally mediated syncope, a functioning autonomic nervous 
system is necessary, in contrast to syncope resulting from autonomic 
failure (discussed below).

Multiple triggers of the afferent limb of the reflex arc can result in 
neurally  mediated  syncope.  In  some  situations,  these  can  be  clearly 
defined,  e.g.,  orthostatic  stress  and  stimulus  of  the  carotid  sinus,  the 
gastrointestinal  tract,  or  the  bladder.  Often,  however,  the  trigger  is 
less  easily  recognized  and  the  cause  is  multifactorial.  Under  these 
circumstances, it is likely that different afferent pathways converge on 
the central autonomic network within the medulla that integrates the 
neural impulses and mediates the vasodepressor-bradycardic response.

Classification of Neurally Mediated Syncope  Neurally medi-
ated  syncope  may  be  subdivided  based  on  the  afferent  pathway  and 
provocative trigger. Vasovagal syncope (the common faint) is provoked

slow” EEG pattern. Finger beat-to-beat blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), and selected EEG channels are shown. EEG slowing starts when systolic blood pressure 
drops to ~50 mmHg; heart rate is then ~45 beats/min (bpm). Asystole occurred, lasting about 8 s. The EEG flattens for a similar period, but with a delay. A transient loss of 
consciousness, lasting 14 s, was observed. There were muscle jerks just before and just after the flat period of the EEG. (From W Wieling et al: Symptoms and signs of

by intense emotion, pain, and/or orthostatic stress, whereas the situa-
tional reflex syncopes have specific localized stimuli that provoke the 
reflex vasodilation and bradycardia that leads to syncope. The underly-
ing mechanisms have been identified and pathophysiology delineated 
for most of these situational reflex syncopes. The afferent trigger may 
originate in the pulmonary system, gastrointestinal system, urogenital 
system,  heart,  and  carotid  sinus  in  the  carotid  artery  (Table  21-2). 
Hyperventilation leading to hypocarbia and cerebral vasoconstriction, 
and  raised  intrathoracic  pressure  that  impairs  venous  return  to  the 

heart,  play  a  central  role  in  many  of  the  situational  reflex  syncopes. 
The afferent pathway of the reflex arc differs among these disorders, 
but  the  efferent  response  via  the  vagus  and  sympathetic  pathways  is  
similar.

Alternately, neurally mediated syncope may be subdivided based on 
the  predominant  efferent  pathway.  Vasodepressor  syncope  describes 
syncope  predominantly  due  to  efferent,  sympathetic,  vasoconstrictor 
failure;  cardioinhibitory  syncope  describes  syncope  predominantly 
associated with bradycardia or asystole due to increased vagal outflow;

Features of Neurally Mediated Syncope 
In addition to symp-
toms of orthostatic intolerance such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and 
fatigue, premonitory features of autonomic activation may be present 
in patients with neurally mediated syncope. These include diaphoresis, 
pallor, palpitations, nausea, hyperventilation, and yawning. During the 
syncopal  event,  proximal  and  distal  myoclonus  (typically  arrhythmic 
and multifocal) may occur, raising the possibility of a seizure. The eyes 
typically remain open and usually deviate upward. Pupils are usually 
dilated. Roving eye movements may occur. Grunting, moaning, snort-
ing,  and  stertorous  breathing  may  be  present.  Urinary  incontinence 
may occur. Fecal incontinence is very rare, however. Postictal confu-
sion is also rare, although visual and auditory hallucinations and near-
death and out-of-body experiences are sometimes reported.

Although  some  predisposing  factors  and  provocative  stimuli  are 
well established (for example, motionless upright posture, warm ambi-
ent  temperature,  intravascular  volume  depletion,  alcohol  ingestion, 
hypoxemia, anemia, pain, the sight of blood, venipuncture, and intense 
emotion), the underlying basis for the widely different thresholds for 
syncope among individuals exposed to the same provocative stimulus 
is  not  known.  A  genetic  basis  for  neurally  mediated  syncope  may 
exist; several studies have reported an increased incidence of syncope 
in first-degree relatives of fainters, but no gene or genetic marker has 
been  identified,  and  environmental,  social,  and  cultural  factors  have 
not been excluded by these studies.

TREATMENT
Neurally Mediated Syncope

Reassurance,  education,  avoidance  of  provocative  stimuli,  and 
plasma volume expansion with fluid and salt are the cornerstones 
of the management of neurally mediated syncope. Isometric coun-
terpressure maneuvers of the limbs (tensing of the abdominal and 
leg muscles, handgrip and arm tensing, and leg crossing) may raise 
blood  pressure  by  increasing  central  blood  volume  and  cardiac 
output. Of these, abdominal muscle tensing is the most effective. By 
maintaining pressure in the autoregulatory zone, these maneuvers, 
which may be particularly helpful in patients with a long prodrome, 
avoid or delay the onset of syncope. Randomized controlled trials 
support this intervention.

Fludrocortisone, vasoconstricting agents, and β-adrenoreceptor 
antagonists are widely used by experts to treat refractory patients, 
although  there  is  no  consistent  evidence  from  randomized  con-
trolled  trials  for  any  pharmacotherapy  to  treat  neurally  mediated 
syncope.  Because  vasodilation,  decreased  central  blood  volume, 
decreased  stroke  volume  and  cardiac  output  are  the  dominant 
pathophysiologic  syncopal  mechanisms  in  most  patients,  use  of  a 
cardiac pacemaker is rarely beneficial. A systematic review of the 
literature examining whether cardiac pacing reduces risk of recur-
rent syncope and relevant clinical outcomes in adults with neurally 
mediated  syncope,  concluded  that  the  existing  evidence  does  not 
support the use of routine cardiac pacing. Possible exceptions are 
(1)  older  patients  (>40  years),  with  at  least  three  prior  episodes 
associated with asystole (of at least 3 s associated with syncope or at 
least 6 s associated with presyncope) documented by an implantable 
loop recorder; and (2) patients with prominent cardioinhibition due 
to carotid sinus syndrome. In these patients, dual-chamber pacing 
may be helpful, although this continues to be an area of uncertainty.

 ■ ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION
Orthostatic  hypotension,  defined  as  a  reduction  in  systolic  blood 
pressure  of  at  least  20  mmHg  or  diastolic  blood  pressure  of  at  least 
10  mmHg  after  3  min  of  standing  or  head-up  tilt  on  a  tilt  table,  is 
a  manifestation  of  sympathetic  vasoconstrictor  (autonomic)  failure  
(Fig.  21-4).  In  many  (but  not  all)  cases,  there  is  no  compensatory

increase in heart rate despite hypotension; with partial autonomic fail-
ure, heart rate may increase to some degree but is insufficient to main-
tain cardiac output. A variant of orthostatic hypotension is “delayed” 
orthostatic hypotension, which occurs beyond 3 min of standing; this 
may reflect a mild or early form of sympathetic adrenergic dysfunction. 
In some cases, orthostatic hypotension occurs within 15 s of standing 
(so-called  initial  orthostatic  hypotension),  a  finding  that  may  reflect 
a transient mismatch between cardiac output and peripheral vascular 
resistance and does not represent autonomic failure.

Characteristic  symptoms  of  orthostatic  hypotension  include 
light-headedness,  dizziness,  and  presyncope  (near-faintness)  occur-
ring in response to sudden postural change. However, symptoms may 
be  absent  or  nonspecific,  such  as  generalized  weakness,  fatigue,  cog-
nitive slowing, leg buckling, or headache. Visual blurring may occur, 
likely  due  to  retinal  or  occipital  lobe  ischemia.  Neck  pain,  typically 
in the suboccipital, posterior cervical, and shoulder region (the “coat-
hanger headache”), most likely due to neck muscle ischemia, may be 
the only symptom. Patients may report orthostatic dyspnea (thought 
to reflect ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to inadequate perfusion 
of ventilated lung apices) or angina (attributed to impaired myocardial 
perfusion  even  with  normal  coronary  arteries).  Symptoms  may  be 
exacerbated by exertion, prolonged standing, increased ambient tem-
perature, or meals. Syncope is usually preceded by warning symptoms, 
but may occur suddenly, suggesting the possibility of a seizure or car-
diac cause. Some patients have profound decreases in blood pressure, 
sometimes  without  symptoms  but  placing  them  at  risk  for  falls  and 
injuries if the autoregulatory threshold is crossed with ensuing cerebral 
hypoperfusion.

Supine  hypertension  is  common  in  patients  with  orthostatic 
hypotension  due  to  autonomic  failure,  affecting  >50%  of  patients  in 
some  series.  Orthostatic  hypotension  may  present  after  initiation 
of  therapy  for  hypertension,  and  supine  hypertension  may  follow 
treatment  of  orthostatic  hypotension.  However,  in  other  cases,  the 
association  of  the  two  conditions  is  unrelated  to  therapy;  it  may  in 
part be explained by baroreflex dysfunction in the presence of residual 
sympathetic  outflow,  particularly  in  patients  with  central  autonomic 
degeneration.

Causes  of  Neurogenic  Orthostatic  Hypotension  Causes  of 
neurogenic  orthostatic  hypotension  include  central  and  peripheral 

autonomic  nervous  system  dysfunction 
(Chap.  440).  Autonomic  dysfunction  of 
other organ systems (including the blad-
der,  bowels,  sexual  organs,  and  sudomo-
tor system) of varying severity frequently 
accompanies  orthostatic  hypotension  in 
these disorders (Table 21-2).

The  primary  autonomic  degenerative 
disorders  are  multiple  system  atrophy 
(Shy-Drager syndrome; Chap. 440), Par-
kinson’s  disease  (Chap.  435),  dementia 
with Lewy bodies (Chap. 434), and pure 
autonomic failure (Chap. 440). These are 
often grouped together as “synucleinopa-
thies” due to the presence of α-synuclein, 
a  protein  that  aggregates  predominantly 
in the cytoplasm of neurons in the Lewy 
body  disorders  (Parkinson’s  disease, 
dementia  with  Lewy  bodies,  and  pure 
autonomic failure) and in the glia in mul-
tiple system atrophy.

200

Time (s)

Peripheral autonomic dysfunction may 
also  accompany  small-fiber  peripheral 
neuropathies such as those associated with 
diabetes mellitus, acquired and hereditary 
amyloidosis,  immune-mediated  neurop-
athies,  and  hereditary  sensory  and  auto-
nomic  neuropathies  (HSAN;  particularly 
HSAN  type  III,  familial  dysautonomia) 
(Chaps.  446  and  447).  Less  frequently,  orthostatic  hypotension  is 
associated  with  the  peripheral  neuropathies  that  accompany  vitamin 
B12  deficiency,  neurotoxin  exposure,  HIV  and  other  infections,  and 
porphyria.

Patients  with  autonomic  failure  and  the  elderly  are  susceptible  to 
falls  in  blood  pressure  associated  with  meals.  The  magnitude  of  the 
blood pressure fall is exacerbated by large meals, meals high in carbo-
hydrate, and alcohol intake. The mechanism of postprandial syncope 
is not fully elucidated.

Orthostatic  hypotension  is  often  iatrogenic.  Drugs  from  several 
classes may lower peripheral resistance (e.g., α-adrenoreceptor antag-
onists  used  to  treat  hypertension  and  prostatic  hypertrophy;  antihy-
pertensive  agents  of  several  classes;  nitrates  and  other  vasodilators; 
tricyclic  agents  and  phenothiazines).  Iatrogenic  volume  depletion 
due to diuresis and volume depletion due to medical causes (hemor-
rhage, vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased fluid intake) may also result in 
decreased  effective  circulatory  volume,  orthostatic  hypotension,  and 
syncope.

TREATMENT
Orthostatic Hypotension

The  first  step  is  to  remove  reversible  causes—usually  vasoactive 
medications  (see  Table  440-6).  Next,  nonpharmacologic  inter-
ventions  should  be  introduced.  These  include  patient  education 
regarding staged moves from supine to upright; warnings about the 
hypotensive effects of large meals; instructions about the isometric 
counterpressure  maneuvers  that  increase  intravascular  pressure 
(see above); and raising the head of the bed to reduce supine hyper-
tension  and  nocturnal  diuresis.  Intravascular  volume  should  be 
expanded by increasing dietary fluid and salt. If these nonpharma-
cologic measures fail, pharmacologic intervention with fludrocor-
tisone acetate and vasoconstricting agents such as midodrine and 
l-dihydroxyphenylserine should be introduced. Some patients with 
intractable symptoms require additional therapy with supplemen-
tary  agents  that  include  pyridostigmine,  atomoxetine,  yohimbine, 
octreotide,  desmopressin  acetate  (DDAVP),  and  erythropoietin 
(Chap. 440).

 ■ CARDIAC SYNCOPE
Cardiac  (or  cardiovascular)  syncope  is  caused  by  arrhythmias  and 
structural  heart  disease.  These  may  occur  in  combination  because 
structural disease renders the heart more vulnerable to abnormal elec-
trical activity.

Arrhythmias  Bradyarrhythmias  that  cause  syncope  include  those 
due  to  severe  sinus  node  dysfunction  (e.g.,  sinus  arrest  or  sinoatrial 
block)  and  atrioventricular  (AV)  block  (e.g.,  Mobitz  type  II,  high-
grade,  and  complete  AV  block).  The  bradyarrhythmias  due  to  sinus 
node dysfunction are often associated with an atrial tachyarrhythmia, 
a  disorder  known  as  the  tachycardia-bradycardia  syndrome.  A  pro-
longed  pause  following  the  termination  of  a  tachycardic  episode  is  a 
frequent cause of syncope in patients with the tachycardia-bradycardia 
syndrome. Medications of several classes may also cause bradyarrhyth-
mias of sufficient severity to cause syncope. Syncope due to bradycar-
dia or asystole has been referred to as a Stokes-Adams attack.

Ventricular  tachyarrhythmias  frequently  cause  syncope.  The  like-
lihood  of  syncope  with  ventricular  tachycardia  is  in  part  dependent 
on  the  ventricular  rate;  rates  <200  beats/min  are  less  likely  to  cause 
syncope. The compromised hemodynamic function during ventricular 
tachycardia  is  caused  by  ineffective  ventricular  contraction,  reduced 
diastolic filling due to abbreviated filling periods, loss of AV synchrony, 
and concurrent myocardial ischemia.

Several disorders associated with cardiac electrophysiologic instabil-
ity and arrhythmogenesis are due to mutations in ion channel subunit 
genes. These include the long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and 
catecholaminergic  polymorphic  ventricular  tachycardia.  The  long 
QT syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with 
prolonged  cardiac  repolarization  and  a  predisposition  to  ventricular 
arrhythmias.  Syncope  and  sudden  death  in  patients  with  long  QT 
syndrome  result  from  a  unique  polymorphic  ventricular  tachycardia 
called torsades des pointes that degenerates into ventricular fibrillation. 
The long QT syndrome has been linked to genes encoding K+ channel 
α-subunits,  K+  channel  β-subunits,  voltage-gated  Na+  channel,  and  a 
scaffolding protein, ankyrin B (ANK2). Brugada syndrome is charac-
terized  by  idiopathic  ventricular  fibrillation  in  association  with  right 
ventricular electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities without structural 
heart disease. This disorder is also genetically heterogeneous, although 
it is most frequently linked to mutations in the Na+ channel α-subunit, 
SCN5A.  Catecholaminergic  polymorphic  tachycardia  is  an  inher-
ited,  genetically  heterogeneous  disorder  associated  with  exercise-  or 
stress-induced  ventricular  arrhythmias,  syncope,  or  sudden  death. 
Acquired QT interval prolongation, most commonly due to drugs, may 
also  result  in  ventricular  arrhythmias  and  syncope.  These  disorders 
are discussed in detail in Chap. 255.

Structural Disease  Structural heart disease (e.g., valvular disease, 
myocardial  ischemia,  hypertrophic  and  other  cardiomyopathies,  car-
diac masses such as atrial myxoma, and pericardial effusions) may lead 
to  syncope  by  compromising  cardiac  output.  Structural  disease  may 
also contribute to other pathophysiologic mechanisms of syncope. For 
example, cardiac structural disease may predispose to arrhythmogen-
esis; aggressive treatment of cardiac failure with diuretics and/or vaso-
dilators may lead to orthostatic hypotension; and inappropriate reflex 
vasodilation may occur with structural disorders such as aortic stenosis 
and  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  possibly  provoked  by  increased 
ventricular contractility.

TREATMENT
Cardiac Syncope

Treatment of cardiac disease depends on the underlying disorder. 
Therapies  for  arrhythmias  include  cardiac  pacing  for  sinus  node 
disease  and  AV  block,  and  ablation,  antiarrhythmic  drugs,  and   
cardioverter-defibrillators  for  atrial  and  ventricular  tachyarrhyth-
mias. These disorders are best managed by physicians with special-
ized skills in this area.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Syncope 

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Syncope  is  easily  diagnosed  when  the  characteristic  features  are 
present; however, several disorders with transient real or apparent 
loss of consciousness may create diagnostic confusion.

Generalized and partial seizures may be confused with syncope; 
however,  there  are  a  number  of  differentiating  features.  Whereas 
tonic-clonic movements are the hallmark of a generalized seizure, 
myoclonic and other movements also may occur in up to 90% of 
syncopal  episodes.  Myoclonic  jerks  associated  with  syncope  may 
be multifocal or generalized. They are typically arrhythmic and of 
short duration (<30 s). Mild flexor and extensor posturing also may 
occur. Partial or partial-complex seizures with secondary general-
ization are usually preceded by an aura, commonly an unpleasant 
smell; fear; anxiety; abdominal discomfort; or other visceral sensa-
tions. These phenomena should be differentiated from the premon-
itory features of syncope.

Autonomic  manifestations  of  seizures  (autonomic  epilepsy) 
may provide a more difficult diagnostic challenge. Autonomic sei-
zures  have  cardiovascular,  gastrointestinal,  pulmonary,  urogenital, 
pupillary,  and  cutaneous  manifestations  that  are  similar  to  the 
premonitory  features  of  syncope.  Furthermore,  the  cardiovascular 
manifestations  of  autonomic  epilepsy  include  clinically  significant 
tachycardias and bradycardias that may be of sufficient magnitude 
to cause loss of consciousness. The presence of accompanying non-
autonomic auras may help differentiate these episodes from syncope.

Loss  of  consciousness  associated  with  a  seizure  usually  lasts   
>5 min and is associated with prolonged postictal drowsiness and 
disorientation,  whereas  reorientation  occurs  almost  immediately 
after a syncopal event. Muscle aches may occur after both syncope 
and seizures, although they tend to last longer and be more severe 
following a seizure. Seizures, unlike syncope, are rarely provoked by 
emotions or pain. Incontinence of urine may occur with both sei-
zures and syncope; however, fecal incontinence occurs very rarely 
with syncope.

Hypoglycemia  may  cause  transient  loss  of  consciousness,  typ-
ically  in  individuals  with  type  1  or  type  2  diabetes  (Chap.  403) 
treated with insulin. The clinical features associated with impend-
ing  or  actual  hypoglycemia  include  tremor,  palpitations,  anxiety, 
diaphoresis, hunger, and paresthesias. These symptoms are due to 
autonomic activation to counter the falling blood glucose. Hunger, 
in particular, is not a typical premonitory feature of syncope. Hypo-
glycemia also impairs neuronal function, leading to fatigue, weak-
ness, dizziness, and cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Diagnostic 
difficulties  may  occur  in  individuals  in  strict  glycemic  control; 
repeated hypoglycemia impairs the counterregulatory response and 
leads to a loss of the characteristic warning symptoms that are the 
hallmark of hypoglycemia.

Patients with cataplexy (Chap. 31) experience an abrupt partial 
or  complete  loss  of  muscular  tone  triggered  by  strong  emotions, 
typically anger or laughter. Unlike syncope, consciousness is main-
tained throughout the attacks, which typically last between 30 s and 
2  min.  There  are  no  premonitory  symptoms.  Cataplexy  occurs  in 
60%–75% of patients with narcolepsy.

The clinical interview and interrogation of eyewitnesses usually 
allow  differentiation  of  syncope  from  falls  due  to  vestibular  dys-
function,  cerebellar  disease,  extrapyramidal  system  dysfunction, 
and other gait disorders. A diagnosis of syncope can be particularly 
challenging in patients with dementia who experience repeated falls 
and are unable to provide a clear history of the episodes. If the fall is 
accompanied by head trauma, a postconcussive syndrome, amnesia 
for the precipitating events, and/or a loss or alteration of conscious-
ness, this may also contribute to diagnostic difficulty.

Apparent loss of consciousness can be a manifestation of psychi-
atric disorders such as generalized anxiety, panic disorders, major

depression, and somatization disorder. These possibilities should be 
considered in individuals who faint frequently without prodromal 
symptoms. Such patients are rarely injured despite numerous falls. 
There  are  no  clinically  significant  hemodynamic  changes  concur-
rent with these episodes. In contrast, transient loss of consciousness 
due  to  vasovagal  syncope  precipitated  by  fear,  stress,  anxiety,  and 
emotional  distress  is  accompanied  by  hypotension,  bradycardia, 
or both. 
INITIAL EVALUATION
The goals of the initial evaluation are to determine whether the tran-
sient loss of consciousness was due to syncope; to identify the cause; 
and to assess risk for future episodes and serious harm (Table 21-1). 
The  initial  evaluation  should  include  a  detailed  history,  thorough 
questioning  of  eyewitnesses,  and  a  complete  physical  and  neu-
rologic  examination.  Blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  should  be 
measured  in  the  supine  position  and  after  3  min  of  standing  to 
determine  whether  orthostatic  hypotension  is  present.  High-risk 
features  on  history  include:  the  new  onset  of  chest  discomfort, 
abdominal pain, shortness of breath or headache; syncope during 
exertion or while supine; sudden onset of palpitations followed by 
syncope; severe coronary artery or structural heart disease.

High-risk features on examination include an unexplained sys-
tolic BP of <90 mmHg; suggestion of gastrointestinal hemorrhage; 
persistent  bradycardia  (<40  beats/min);  and  an  undiagnosed  sys-
tolic murmur.

An  ECG  should  be  performed  if  there  is  suspicion  of  syncope 
due  to  an  arrhythmia  or  underlying  cardiac  disease.  Relevant 
electrocardiographic  abnormalities  include  bradyarrhythmias  or 
tachyarrhythmias, AV block, acute myocardial ischemia, old myo-
cardial infarction, long QTc, and bundle branch block. This initial 
assessment will lead to the identification of a cause of syncope in 
~50% of patients and also allows stratification of patients at risk for 
cardiac mortality. 
Laboratory Tests  Baseline laboratory blood tests are rarely helpful 
in  identifying  the  cause  of  syncope.  Blood  tests  should  be  per-
formed when specific disorders, e.g., myocardial infarction, anemia, 
and secondary autonomic failure, are suspected (Table 21-2). 
Autonomic Nervous System Testing (Chap. 440)  Autonomic test-
ing,  including  tilt-table  testing,  can  be  performed  in  specialized 
centers. Autonomic testing is helpful to uncover objective evidence 
of  autonomic  failure  and  also  to  demonstrate  a  predisposition  to 
neurally  mediated  syncope.  Autonomic  testing  includes  assess-
ments of parasympathetic autonomic nervous system function (e.g., 
heart rate variability to deep respiration and a Valsalva maneuver), 
sympathetic  cholinergic  function  (e.g.,  thermoregulatory  sweat 
response  and  quantitative  sudomotor  axon  reflex  test),  and  sym-
pathetic  adrenergic  function  (e.g.,  blood  pressure  response  to  a   
Valsalva  maneuver  and  a  tilt-table  test  with  beat-to-beat  blood 
pressure measurement). The hemodynamic abnormalities demon-
strated on the tilt-table test (Figs. 21-3 and 21-4) may be useful in 
distinguishing  orthostatic  hypotension  due  to  autonomic  failure 
from  the  hypotensive  bradycardic  response  of  neurally  mediated 
syncope. Similarly, the tilt-table test may help identify patients with 
syncope due to immediate or delayed orthostatic hypotension.

Carotid  sinus  massage  should  be  considered  in  patients  with 
symptoms  suggestive  of  carotid  sinus  syncope  and  in  patients   
>40  years  with  recurrent  syncope  of  unknown  etiology.  This  test 
should only be carried out under continuous ECG and blood pres-
sure  monitoring  and  should  be  avoided  in  patients  with  carotid 
bruits, possible or known plaques, or stenosis. 
Cardiac Evaluation  ECG monitoring is indicated for patients with 
a  high  pretest  probability  of  arrhythmia  causing  syncope.  Patients 
should  be  monitored  in  the  hospital  if  the  likelihood  of  a  life- 
threatening  arrhythmia  is  high,  e.g.,  patients  with  severe  coro-
nary  artery  or  structural  heart  disease,  nonsustained  ventricular 

tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrilla-
tion, trifascicular heart block, prolonged QT interval, Brugada syn-
drome ECG pattern, syncope during exertion, syncope while seated 
or supine, and family history of sudden cardiac death (Table 21-1). 
Outpatient  Holter  monitoring  is  recommended  for  patients  who 
experience frequent syncopal episodes (e.g., one or more per week), 
whereas loop recorders, which continually record and erase cardiac 
rhythm, are indicated for patients with suspected arrhythmias with 
low risk of sudden cardiac death. Loop recorders may be external 
(e.g., for evaluation of episodes that occur at a frequency of >1 per 
month) or implantable (e.g., if syncope occurs less frequently).

Echocardiography  should  be  performed  in  patients  with  a  his-
tory  of  cardiac  disease  or  if  abnormalities  are  found  on  physical 
examination  or  the  ECG.  Echocardiographic  diagnoses  that  may 
be  responsible  for  syncope  include  aortic  stenosis,  hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, cardiac tumors, aortic dissection, and pericardial 
tamponade. Echocardiography also has a role in risk stratification 
based on the left ventricular ejection fraction.

Treadmill  exercise  testing  with  ECG  and  blood  pressure  mon-
itoring  should  be  performed  in  patients  who  have  experienced 
syncope during or shortly after exercise. Treadmill testing may help 
identify exercise-induced arrhythmias (e.g., tachycardia-related AV 
block) and exercise-induced exaggerated vasodilation.

Electrophysiologic  studies  are  indicated  in  patients  with  struc-
tural  heart  disease  and  ECG  abnormalities  in  whom  noninvasive 
investigations  have  failed  to  yield  a  diagnosis.  Electrophysiologic 
studies have low sensitivity and specificity and should only be per-
formed when a high pretest probability exists. Currently, these tests 
are rarely performed to evaluate patients with syncope. 
Psychiatric  Evaluation  Screening  for  psychiatric  disorders  may 
be  appropriate  in  patients  with  recurrent  unexplained  syncope 
episodes. Tilt-table testing, with demonstration of symptoms in the 
absence  of  hemodynamic  change,  may  be  useful  in  reproducing 
syncope in patients with suspected psychogenic syncope.

22 Dizziness and Vertigo

Mark F. Walker, Robert B. Daroff

Dizziness  is  an  imprecise  symptom  used  to  describe  a  variety  of 
common  sensations  that  include  vertigo,  light-headedness,  faintness, 
and imbalance. Vertigo refers to a sense of spinning or other motion 
that may be physiological, occurring during or after a sustained head 
rotation,  or  pathological,  due  to  vestibular  dysfunction.  The  term 
light-headedness is classically applied to presyncopal sensations result-
ing from brain hypoperfusion but as used by patients has little spec-
ificity, as it may also refer to other symptoms such as disequilibrium 
and imbalance. A challenge to diagnosis is that patients often have dif-
ficulty distinguishing among these various symptoms, and the words 
they choose do not reliably indicate the underlying etiology.

There  are  many  causes  of  dizziness.  Vestibular  dizziness  (vertigo 
or imbalance) may be due to peripheral disorders that affect the laby-
rinths or vestibular nerves, or it may result from disruption of central 
vestibular pathways. It may be paroxysmal or due to a fixed unilateral 
or bilateral vestibular deficit. Acute unilateral lesions cause vertigo due 
to  a  sudden  imbalance  in  vestibular  inputs  from  the  two  labyrinths. 
Bilateral  lesions  cause  imbalance  and  instability  of  vision  when  the 
head moves (oscillopsia) due to loss of normal vestibular reflexes.

Presyncopal  dizziness  occurs  when  cardiac  dysrhythmia,  orthos-
tatic hypotension, medication effects, or another cause leads to brain 
hypoperfusion.  Such  presyncopal  sensations  vary  in  duration;  they 
may  increase  in  severity  until  loss  of  consciousness  occurs,  or  they 
may  resolve  before  loss  of  consciousness  if  the  cerebral  ischemia  is 
corrected.  Faintness  and  syncope,  which  are  discussed  in  detail  in 
Chap. 21, should always be considered when one is evaluating patients 
with brief episodes of dizziness or dizziness that occurs with upright 
posture.  Other  causes  of  dizziness  include  nonvestibular  imbalance, 
gait  disorders  (e.g.,  loss  of  proprioception  from  sensory  neuropathy, 
parkinsonism), and anxiety.

When  evaluating  patients  with  dizziness,  questions  to  consider 
include  the  following:  (1)  Is  it  dangerous  (e.g.,  arrhythmia,  transient 
ischemic  attack/stroke)?  (2)  Is  it  vestibular?  (3)  If  vestibular,  is  it 
peripheral  or  central?  A  careful  history  and  examination  often  pro-
vide  sufficient  information  to  answer  these  questions  and  determine 
whether additional studies or referral to a specialist is necessary.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Dizziness 

HISTORY
When a patient presents with dizziness, the first step is to delineate 
more  precisely  the  nature  of  the  symptom.  In  the  case  of  vestib-
ular  disorders,  the  physical  symptoms  depend  on  whether  the 
lesion is unilateral or bilateral, and whether it is acute or chronic. 
Vertigo,  an  illusion  of  self  or  environmental  motion,  implies  an 
acute  asymmetry  of  vestibular  inputs  from  the  two  labyrinths  or 
in their central pathways. Symmetric bilateral vestibular hypofunc-
tion causes imbalance but no vertigo. Because of the ambiguity in 
patients’  descriptions  of  their  symptoms,  diagnosis  based  simply 
on symptom characteristics is typically unreliable. Thus the history 
should focus closely on other features, including whether this is the 
first attack, the duration of this and any prior episodes, provoking 
factors, and accompanying symptoms.

Dizziness  can  be  divided  into  episodes  that  last  for  seconds, 
minutes,  hours,  or  days.  Common  causes  of  brief  dizziness  (sec-
onds)  include  benign  paroxysmal  positional  vertigo  (BPPV)  and 
orthostatic  hypotension,  both  of  which  typically  are  provoked  by 
changes in head and/or body position relative to gravity. Attacks of 
vestibular  migraine  and  Ménière’s  disease  often  last  hours.  When 
episodes are of intermediate duration (minutes), transient ischemic 

attacks of the posterior circulation should be considered, although 
migraine and other causes are also possible.

Symptoms that accompany vertigo may be helpful in distinguish-
ing  peripheral  vestibular  lesions  from  central  causes.  Unilateral 
hearing  loss  and  other  acute  aural  symptoms  (ear  pain,  pressure, 
fullness, new tinnitus) typically point to a peripheral cause. Because 
the auditory pathways quickly become bilateral upon entering the 
brainstem,  central  lesions  are  unlikely  to  cause  unilateral  hearing 
loss unless the lesion lies near the root entry zone of the auditory 
nerve. Symptoms such as double vision, numbness, and limb ataxia 
suggest a brainstem or cerebellar lesion. 
EXAMINATION
Because dizziness and imbalance can be a manifestation of a variety 
of  neurologic  disorders,  the  neurologic  examination  is  impor-
tant  in  the  evaluation  of  these  patients.  Focus  should  be  given  to 
assessment  of  eye  movements,  vestibular  function,  and  hearing. 
The  range  of  eye  movements  and  whether  they  are  equal  in  each 
eye should be observed. Peripheral eye movement disorders (e.g., 
cranial neuropathies, eye muscle weakness) are usually disconjugate 
(different in the two eyes). One should check pursuit (the ability to 
follow a smoothly moving target) and saccades (the ability to look 
back  and  forth  accurately  between  two  targets).  Poor  pursuit  or 
inaccurate (dysmetric) saccades usually indicate central pathology, 
often involving the cerebellum. Alignment of the two eyes can be 
checked with a cover test: while the patient is looking at a target, 
alternately  cover  the  eyes  and  observe  for  corrective  saccades.  A 
vertical misalignment may indicate a brainstem or cerebellar lesion. 
Finally, one should look for spontaneous nystagmus, an involuntary 
back-and-forth movement of the eyes. Nystagmus is most often of 
the  jerk  type,  in  which  a  slow  drift  (slow  phase)  in  one  direction 
alternates  with  a  rapid  saccadic  movement  (quick  phase  or  fast 
phase) in the opposite direction that resets the position of the eyes 
in the orbits. Except in the case of acute vestibulopathy (e.g., ves-
tibular neuritis), if primary position nystagmus is easily seen in the 
light, it is probably due to a central cause. Two forms of nystagmus 
that are characteristic of lesions of the cerebellar pathways are ver-
tical nystagmus with downward fast phases (downbeat nystagmus) 
and horizontal nystagmus that changes direction with gaze (gaze-
evoked nystagmus). By contrast, peripheral lesions typically cause 
unidirectional  horizontal  nystagmus.  Use  of  Frenzel  eyeglasses 
(self-illuminated goggles with convex lenses that blur the patient’s 
vision but allow the examiner to see the eyes greatly magnified) or 
infrared  video  goggles  can  aid  in  the  detection  of  peripheral  ves-
tibular nystagmus, because they reduce the patient’s ability to use 
visual fixation to suppress nystagmus. Table 22-1 outlines key find-
ings that help distinguish peripheral from central causes of vertigo.
The most useful bedside test of peripheral vestibular function is 
the head impulse test, in which the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is 
assessed with small-amplitude (~20 degrees) rapid head rotations. 
While the patient fixates on a target, the head is rotated quickly to 
the left or right. If the VOR is deficient, the rotation is followed by a 
catch-up saccade in the opposite direction (e.g., a leftward saccade 

TABLE 22-1  Features of Peripheral and Central Vertigo
•	 Nystagmus from an acute peripheral lesion is unidirectional, with fast phases 
beating away from the ear with the lesion. Nystagmus that changes direction 
with gaze is due to a central lesion.

•	 Transient mixed vertical-torsional nystagmus occurs in benign paroxysmal 
positional vertigo (BPPV), but pure vertical or pure torsional nystagmus is a 
central sign.

•	 Nystagmus from a peripheral lesion may be inhibited by visual fixation, 

whereas central nystagmus is not suppressed.

•	 Absence of a head impulse sign in a patient with acute prolonged vertigo 

should suggest a central cause.

•	 Unilateral hearing loss suggests peripheral vertigo. Findings such as diplopia, 

dysarthria, and limb ataxia suggest a central disorder.

after a rightward rotation). The head impulse test can identify both 
unilateral (catch-up saccades after rotations toward the weak side) 
and bilateral (catch-up saccades after rotations in both directions) 
vestibular hypofunction.

All  patients  with  episodic  dizziness,  especially  if  provoked  by 
positional change, should be tested with the Dix-Hallpike maneu-
ver. The patient begins in a sitting position with the head turned 45 
degrees; holding the back of the head, the examiner then lowers the 
patient into a supine position with the head extended backward by 
about 20 degrees while watching the eyes. Posterior canal BPPV can 
be  diagnosed  confidently  if  transient  upbeating-torsional  nystag-
mus is seen. If no nystagmus is observed after 15–20 s, the patient is 
raised to the sitting position, and the procedure is repeated with the 
head turned to the other side. Again, Frenzel goggles may improve 
the sensitivity of the test.

Dynamic visual acuity is a functional test that can be useful in 
assessing  vestibular  function.  Visual  acuity  is  measured  with  the 
head still and when the head is rotated back and forth by the exam-
iner (about 1–2 Hz). A drop in visual acuity during head motion of 
more than one line on a near card or Snellen chart is abnormal and 
indicates vestibular dysfunction. 
ANCILLARY TESTING
The  choice  of  ancillary  tests  should  be  guided  by  the  history  and 
examination findings. Audiometry should be performed whenever 
a  vestibular  disorder  is  suspected.  Unilateral  sensorineural  hear-
ing  loss  supports  a  peripheral  disorder  (e.g.,  vestibular  schwan-
noma). Predominantly low-frequency hearing loss is characteristic 
of Ménière’s disease. Videonystagmography includes recordings of 
spontaneous nystagmus (if present) and measurement of positional 
nystagmus.  Caloric  testing  compares  the  responses  of  the  two 
horizontal  semicircular  canals,  while  video  head-impulse  testing 
measures the integrity of each of the six semicircular canals. Ves-
tibular  evoked  potentials  assess  otolith  reflexes.  The  test  battery 
often includes recording of saccades and pursuit to evaluate central 
ocular motor function. Neuroimaging is important if a central ves-
tibular disorder is suspected. In addition, patients with unexplained 
unilateral hearing loss or vestibular hypofunction should undergo 
MRI  of  the  internal  auditory  canals,  including  administration  of 
gadolinium, to rule out a schwannoma.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT
Treatment of vestibular symptoms should be driven by the underlying 
diagnosis. Simply treating dizziness with vestibular suppressant med-
ications is often not helpful and may make the symptoms worse and 
prolong  recovery.  The  diagnostic  and  specific  treatment  approaches 
for the most commonly encountered vestibular disorders are discussed 
below.
 ■ ACUTE PROLONGED VERTIGO (VESTIBULAR 
NEURITIS)
An  acute  unilateral  vestibular  lesion  causes  constant  vertigo,  nausea, 
vomiting,  oscillopsia  (motion  of  the  visual  scene),  and  imbalance. 
These  symptoms  are  due  to  a  sudden  asymmetry  of  inputs  from  the 
two labyrinths or in their central connections, simulating a continuous 
rotation  of  the  head.  Unlike  BPPV,  continuous  vertigo  persists  even 
when the head remains still.

When a patient presents with an acute vestibular syndrome, the most 
important question is whether the lesion is central (e.g., a cerebellar or 
brainstem  infarct  or  hemorrhage),  which  may  be  life-threatening,  or 
peripheral, affecting the vestibular nerve or labyrinth (vestibular neu-
ritis). Attention should be given to any symptoms or signs that point 
to  central  dysfunction  (diplopia,  weakness  or  numbness,  dysarthria). 
The  pattern  of  spontaneous  nystagmus,  if  present,  may  be  helpful 
(Table  22-1).  If  the  head  impulse  test  is  normal,  an  acute  peripheral 
vestibular lesion is unlikely. A central lesion cannot always be excluded 
with certainty based on symptoms and examination alone; thus older 
patients with vascular risk factors who present with an acute vestibular 

syndrome should be evaluated for the possibility of stroke even when 
there are no specific findings that indicate a central lesion.

Most  patients  with  vestibular  neuritis  recover  spontaneously, 
although chronic dizziness, motion sensitivity, and disequilibrium may 
persist. The role of early glucocorticoid therapy is uncertain, as studies 
have yielded disparate results. Antiviral medications are of no proven 
benefit and are not typically given unless there is evidence to suggest 
herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome). Vestibular suppressant 
medications may reduce acute symptoms but should be avoided after 
the first several days because they may impede central compensation 
and recovery. Patients should be encouraged to resume a normal level 
of  activity  as  soon  as  possible,  and  directed  vestibular  rehabilitation 
therapy may accelerate improvement.

 ■ BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO
BPPV is a common cause of recurrent vertigo. Episodes are brief (<1 min 
and  typically  15–20  s)  and  are  always  provoked  by  changes  in  head 
position  relative  to  gravity,  such  as  lying  down,  rising  from  a  supine 
position, and extending the head to look upward. Rolling over in bed is 
a common trigger that may help to distinguish BPPV from orthostatic 
hypotension. The attacks are caused by free-floating otoconia (calcium 
carbonate crystals) that have been dislodged from the utricular macula 
and have moved into one of the semicircular canals, usually the pos-
terior canal. When head position changes, gravity causes the otoconia 
to  move  within  the  canal,  producing  vertigo  and  nystagmus.  With 
posterior canal BPPV, the nystagmus beats upward and torsionally (the 
upper poles of the eyes beat toward the affected lower ear). Less com-
monly, the otoconia enter the horizontal canal, resulting in a horizontal 
nystagmus  when  the  patient  is  lying  with  either  ear  down.  Superior 
(also called anterior) canal involvement is rare. BPPV is treated with 
repositioning maneuvers that use gravity to remove the otoconia from 
the semicircular canal. For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver 
(Fig.  22-1)  is  the  most  commonly  used  procedure.  For  more  refrac-
tory cases of BPPV, patients can be taught a variant of this maneuver 
that  they  can  perform  alone  at  home.  A  demonstration  of  the  Epley 
maneuver  is  available  online  (http://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/
disorders/bppv/bppv.html).

 ■ VESTIBULAR MIGRAINE
Vestibular migraine is a common yet underdiagnosed cause of episodic 
vertigo. Vertigo sometimes precedes a typical migraine headache but 
more  often  occurs  without  headache  or  with  only  a  mild  headache. 
Some patients who have had frequent migraine headaches in the past 
present later in life with vestibular migraine as the predominant prob-
lem. In vestibular migraine, the duration of vertigo may be from min-
utes to hours, and some migraineurs also experience more prolonged 
periods  of  disequilibrium  (lasting  days  to  weeks).  Motion  sensitivity 
and  sensitivity  to  visual  motion  (e.g.,  movies)  are  common.  Even  in 
the absence of headache, other migraine features may be present, such 
as  photophobia,  phonophobia,  or  a  visual  aura.  Although  data  from 
controlled  studies  are  generally  lacking,  vestibular  migraine  typically 
is treated with medications that are used for prophylaxis of migraine 
headaches (Chap. 430). Antiemetics may be helpful to relieve symp-
toms at the time of an attack.

 ■ MÉNIÈRE’S DISEASE
Attacks of Ménière’s disease consist of vertigo and hearing loss, as well 
as  pain,  pressure,  and/or  fullness  in  the  affected  ear.  Low-frequency 
hearing  loss  and  aural  symptoms  are  key  features  that  distinguish 
Ménière’s  disease  from  other  peripheral  vestibulopathies  and  from 
vestibular migraine. Audiometry at the time of an attack shows a char-
acteristic asymmetric low-frequency hearing loss; hearing commonly 
improves  between  attacks,  although  permanent  hearing  loss  may 
eventually occur. Ménière’s disease is associated with excess endolymph 
fluid in the inner ear; hence the term endolymphatic hydrops. The exact 
pathophysiological  mechanism,  however,  remains  unclear.  Patients 
suspected  of  having  Ménière’s  disease  should  be  referred  to  an  oto-
laryngologist for further evaluation. Diuretics and sodium restriction 
are  typically  the  initial  treatments.  If  attacks  persist,  injections  of

FIGURE 22-1  Modified Epley maneuver for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the right (top panels) and left (bottom panels) posterior semicircular canals. 
Step 1. With the patient seated, turn the head 45 degrees toward the affected ear. Step 2. Keeping the head turned, lower the patient to the head-hanging position and hold 
for at least 30 s and until nystagmus disappears. Step 3. Without lifting the head, turn it 90 degrees toward the other side. Hold for another 30 s. Step 4. Rotate the patient 
onto her side while turning the head another 90 degrees, so that the nose is pointed down 45 degrees. Hold again for 30 s. Step 5. Have the patient sit up on the side of the 
table. After a brief rest, the maneuver should be repeated to confirm successful treatment. (Reproduced with permission from Chicago dizziness and Hearing (CDH). Figure

glucocorticoids or gentamicin into the middle ear may be considered. 
Nonablative  surgical  options  include  decompression  and  shunting  of 
the endolymphatic sac. Full ablative procedures (vestibular nerve sec-
tion, labyrinthectomy) are seldom required.
 ■ VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA
Vestibular  schwannomas  (sometimes  termed  acoustic  neuromas)  and 
other  tumors  at  the  cerebellopontine  angle  cause  slowly  progressive 
unilateral  sensorineural  hearing  loss  and  vestibular  hypofunction. 
These patients typically do not have vertigo, because the gradual vestib-
ular deficit is compensated centrally as it develops. The diagnosis often 
is not made until there is sufficient hearing loss to be noticed. The ves-
tibular examination will show a deficient response to the head impulse 
test when the head is rotated toward the affected side, but nystagmus 
will not be prominent. As noted above, patients with unexplained uni-
lateral  sensorineural  hearing  loss  or  vestibular  hypofunction  require 
MRI of the internal auditory canals to look for a schwannoma.

 ■ BILATERAL VESTIBULAR HYPOFUNCTION
Patients with bilateral loss of vestibular function also typically do not 
have vertigo, because vestibular function is lost on both sides simul-
taneously,  and  there  is  no  asymmetry  of  vestibular  input.  Symptoms 
include loss of balance, particularly in the dark, where vestibular input 
is most critical, and oscillopsia during head movement, such as while 
walking  or  riding  in  a  car.  Bilateral  vestibular  hypofunction  may  be 
(1) idiopathic and progressive, (2) part of a neurodegenerative disor-
der, or (3) iatrogenic due to medication ototoxicity (most commonly 
gentamicin or other aminoglycoside antibiotics). Other causes include 
bilateral vestibular schwannomas (neurofibromatosis type 2), autoim-
mune disease, superficial siderosis, and meningeal-based infection or 
tumor. It also may occur in patients with peripheral polyneuropathy; 
in these patients, both vestibular loss and impaired proprioception may 
contribute to poor balance. Finally, unilateral processes such as vestib-
ular neuritis and Ménière’s disease may involve both ears sequentially, 
resulting in bilateral vestibulopathy.

Examination  findings  include  diminished  dynamic  visual  acuity 
(see  above)  due  to  loss  of  stable  vision  when  the  head  is  moving, 
abnormal head impulse responses in both directions, and a Romberg 

sign.  Responses  to  caloric  testing  are  reduced.  Patients  with  bilateral 
vestibular hypofunction should be referred for vestibular rehabilitation 
therapy. Vestibular suppressant medications should not be used, as they 
will increase the imbalance. Evaluation by a neurologist is important 
not only to confirm the diagnosis but also to consider any other asso-
ciated neurologic abnormalities that may clarify the etiology.
 ■ CENTRAL VESTIBULAR DISORDERS
Central lesions causing vertigo typically involve vestibular pathways in 
the brainstem and/or cerebellum. They may be due to discrete lesions, 
such  as  from  ischemic  or  hemorrhagic  stroke  (Chaps.  426–428), 
demyelination (Chap. 444), or tumors (Chap. 90), or they may be due 
to neurodegenerative conditions that include the vestibulocerebellum 
(Chaps.  431–434).  Subacute  cerebellar  degeneration  may  be  due  to 
immune,  including  paraneoplastic,  processes  (Chaps.  94  and  439). 
Table 22-1 outlines important features of the history and examination 
that help to identify central vestibular disorders. Acute central vertigo 
is a medical emergency, due to the possibility of life-threatening stroke 
or hemorrhage. All patients with suspected central vestibular disorders 
should undergo brain MRI, and the patient should be referred for full 
neurologic evaluation.
 ■ PSYCHOSOMATIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIZZINESS
Psychological factors play an important role in chronic dizziness. First, 
dizziness  may  be  a  somatic  manifestation  of  a  psychiatric  condition 
such  as  major  depression,  anxiety,  or  panic  disorder  (Chap.  452). 
Second, patients may develop anxiety and autonomic symptoms as a 
consequence  or  comorbidity  of  an  independent  vestibular  disorder. 
One particular form of this has been termed variously phobic postural 
vertigo,  psychophysiologic  vertigo,  or  chronic  subjective  dizziness,  but 
is  now  referred  to  as  persistent  postural-perceptual  dizziness  (PPPD). 
These patients have a chronic feeling (3 months or longer) of fluctuat-
ing dizziness and disequilibrium that is present at rest but worse while 
standing.  There  is  an  increased  sensitivity  to  self-motion  and  visual 
motion  (e.g.,  watching  movies),  and  a  particular  intensification  of 
symptoms when moving through complex visual environments such as 
supermarkets. Although there may be a past history of an acute vestib-
ular disorder (e.g., vestibular neuritis), the neuro-otologic examination

and vestibular testing are normal or indicative of a compensated ves-
tibular deficit, indicating that the ongoing subjective dizziness cannot 
be explained by a primary vestibular pathology. Anxiety disorders are 
particularly common in patients with chronic dizziness; when present, 
they  contribute  substantially  to  the  morbidity.  Treatment  approaches 
for  PPPD  include  pharmacological  therapy  with  selective  serotonin 
reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs),  cognitive-behavioral  psychotherapy,  and 
vestibular rehabilitation. Vestibular suppressant medications generally 
should be avoided.

TREATMENT
Vertigo

Table 22-2 provides a list of commonly used medications for sup-
pression of vertigo. As noted, these medications should be reserved 
for short-term control of active vertigo, such as during the first few 
days  of  acute  vestibular  neuritis,  or  for  acute  attacks  of  Ménière’s 
disease.  They  are  less  helpful  for  chronic  dizziness  and,  as  previ-
ously  stated,  may  hinder  central  compensation.  An  exception  is 
that  benzodiazepines  may  attenuate  psychosomatic  dizziness  and 
the  associated  anxiety,  although  SSRIs  are  generally  preferable  in 
such patients.

Vestibular  rehabilitation  therapy  promotes  central  adaptation 
processes  that  compensate  for  vestibular  loss  and  also  may  help 
habituate motion sensitivity and other symptoms of psychosomatic 
dizziness. The general approach is to use a graded series of exercises 
that progressively challenge gaze stabilization and balance.

23 Fatigue

Jeffrey M. Gelfand, Vanja C. Douglas

Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in clinical medicine. It 
is a prominent manifestation of a number of systemic, neurologic, and 
psychiatric syndromes, although a precise cause will not be identified 
in  a  substantial  minority  of  patients.  Fatigue  refers  to  the  subjective 
experience of physical and mental weariness, sluggishness, low energy, 
and  exhaustion.  In  the  context  of  clinical  medicine,  fatigue  is  most 
practically  defined  as  difficulty  initiating  or  maintaining  voluntary 
mental or physical activity. Nearly everyone who has ever been ill with 
a self-limited infection has experienced this near-universal symptom, 
and  fatigue  is  usually  brought  to  medical  attention  only  when  it  is 
either of unclear cause, fails to remit, or the severity is out of propor-
tion with what would be expected for the associated trigger.

Fatigue should be distinguished from muscle weakness, a reduction 
of  neuromuscular  power  (Chap.  24);  most  patients  complaining  of 
fatigue are not truly weak when direct muscle power is tested. Fatigue is 
also distinct from somnolence, which refers to sleepiness in the context 
of disturbed sleep-wake physiology (Chap. 31), and from dyspnea on 
exertion, although patients may use the word fatigue to describe any 
of these symptoms. The task facing clinicians when a patient presents 
with fatigue is to identify the underlying cause and develop a therapeu-
tic alliance, the goal of which is to spare patients expensive and fruitless 
diagnostic workups and steer them toward effective therapy.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Variability in the definitions of fatigue and the survey instruments used 
in different studies makes it difficult to arrive at precise figures about 
the global burden of fatigue. The point prevalence of fatigue was 6.7% 
and  the  lifetime  prevalence  was  25%  in  a  large  National  Institute  of 
Mental Health survey of the U.S. general population. In primary care 
clinics in Europe and the United States, between 10 and 25% of patients 
surveyed endorsed symptoms of prolonged (present for >1 month) or 
chronic  (present  for  >6  months)  fatigue,  but  in  only  a  minority  was 
fatigue  the  primary  reason  for  seeking  medical  attention.  In  a  com-
munity  survey  of  women  in  India,  12%  reported  chronic  fatigue.  By 
contrast, the prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome (Chap. 450), as 
defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is low.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Psychiatric Disease  Fatigue  is  a  common  somatic  manifestation 
of  many  major  psychiatric  syndromes,  including  depression,  anxiety, 
and  somatoform  disorders  (Chap.  452).  Psychiatric  symptoms  are 
reported  in  more  than  three-quarters  of  patients  with  unexplained 
chronic fatigue. Even in patients with systemic or neurologic disorders 
in which fatigue is independently recognized as a symptom, comorbid 
psychiatric disease may still be an important contributor.

Neurologic Disease  Patients complaining of fatigue often say they 
feel weak, but upon careful examination, objective muscle weakness is 
rarely  discernible.  If  found,  muscle  weakness  must  then  be  localized 
to the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, neuromus-
cular junction, or muscle, and appropriate follow-up studies obtained 
(Chap.  24).  Fatigability  of  muscle  power  is  a  cardinal  manifestation 
of  some  neuromuscular  disorders  such  as  myasthenia  gravis  and  is 
distinguished from fatigue by finding clinically evident diminution of 
the amount of force that a muscle generates upon repeated contraction 
(Chap.  448).  Fatigue  is  one  of  the  most  common  and  bothersome 
symptoms  reported  in  multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  (Chap.  444),  affect-
ing  nearly  90%  of  patients;  fatigue  in  MS  can  persist  between  MS 
attacks  and  does  not  necessarily  correlate  with  magnetic  resonance 
imaging (MRI) disease activity. Fatigue is also increasingly identified 
as a troublesome feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, includ-
ing  Parkinson’s  disease  (Chap.  435),  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis

(Chap. 437), and central nervous system dysautonomias (Chap. 440). 
Fatigue after stroke (Chap. 426) is a well-described but poorly under-
stood  entity  with  a  widely  varying  prevalence.  Episodic  fatigue  can 
be  a  premonitory  symptom  of  migraine  (Chap.  430).  Fatigue  is  also 
a  frequent  consequence  of  traumatic  brain  injury  (Chap. 443),  often 
occurring in association with depression and sleep disorders.

Sleep Disorders  Obstructive sleep apnea is an important cause of 
excessive daytime sleepiness in association with fatigue and should be 
investigated  using  overnight  polysomnography,  particularly  in  those 
with  prominent  snoring,  obesity,  or  other  predictors  of  obstructive 
sleep  apnea  (Chap.  297).  Whether  the  cumulative  sleep  deprivation 
that  is  common  in  modern  society  contributes  to  clinically  apparent 
fatigue is not known (Chap. 31).

Endocrine  Disorders  Fatigue,  sometimes  in  association  with 
true muscle weakness, can be a heralding symptom of hypothyroidism 
(Chap.  383),  particularly  in  the  context  of  hair  loss,  dry  skin,  cold 
intolerance, constipation, and weight gain. Fatigue associated with heat 
intolerance,  sweating,  and  palpitations  is  typical  of  hyperthyroidism 
(Chap. 384). Adrenal insufficiency (Chap. 386) can also manifest with 
unexplained fatigue as a primary or prominent symptom, often with 
anorexia, weight loss, nausea, myalgias, and arthralgias; hyponatremia, 
hyperkalemia, and hyperpigmentation may be present at time of diag-
nosis. Mild hypercalcemia can cause fatigue, which may be relatively 
vague, whereas severe hypercalcemia can lead to lethargy, stupor, and 
coma (Chap. 410). Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can cause 
lethargy, often in association with confusion; diabetes mellitus, and in 
particular type 1 diabetes, is also associated with fatigue independent 
of glucose levels (Chap. 403). Fatigue may also accompany Cushing’s 
disease, hypoaldosteronism, and hypogonadism. Low vitamin D status 
has also been associated with fatigue.

Liver and Kidney Disease  Both chronic liver failure and chronic 
kidney  disease  can  cause  fatigue.  Over  80%  of  hemodialysis  patients 
complain of fatigue, which makes it one of the most common symp-
toms reported by patients in chronic kidney disease (Chap. 311).

Obesity  Obesity (Chap. 401) is associated with fatigue and sleep-
iness  independent  of  the  presence  of  obstructive  sleep  apnea.  Obese 
patients  undergoing  bariatric  surgery  experience  improvement  in 
daytime sleepiness sooner than would be expected if the improvement 
were solely the result of weight loss and resolution of sleep apnea. A 
number of other factors common in obese patients are likely contrib-
utors as well, including physical inactivity, diabetes, and depression.

be  causative  include  antidepressants,  antipsychotics,  anxiolytics,  opi-
ates, antispasticity agents, antiseizure agents, and beta blockers.

Cardiovascular  and  Pulmonary  Disorders  Fatigue  is  one  of 
the most taxing symptoms reported by patients with congestive heart 
failure  and  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  and  negatively 
affects quality of life. In a population-based cohort study in Norfolk, 
United  Kingdom,  fatigue  was  associated  with  an  increased  hazard 
of  all-cause  mortality  in  the  general  population,  but  particularly  for 
deaths related to cardiovascular disease.

Malignancy  Fatigue,  particularly  in  association  with  unexplained 
weight  loss,  can  be  a  sign  of  occult  malignancy,  but  cancer  is  rarely 
identified in patients with unexplained chronic fatigue in the absence 
of  other  telltale  signs  or  symptoms.  Cancer-related  fatigue  is  experi-
enced by 40% of patients at the time of diagnosis and by >80% at some 
time in the disease course.

Hematologic  Disorders  Chronic  or  progressive  anemia  may 
present with fatigue, sometimes in association with exertional tachy-
cardia  and  breathlessness.  Anemia  may  also  contribute  to  fatigue  in 
chronic illness. Low serum ferritin in the absence of anemia may also 
cause fatigue that is reversible with iron replacement.

Immune-Mediated Disorders  Fatigue is a prominent complaint 
in  many  chronic  inflammatory  disorders,  including  systemic  lupus 
erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, inflam-
matory bowel disease, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–
associated  vasculitis,  sarcoidosis,  and  Sjögren’s  syndrome,  but  is  not 
usually an isolated symptom. Fatigue is also associated with primary 
immunodeficiency diseases.

Pregnancy  Fatigue  is  very  commonly  reported  by  women  during 
all stages of pregnancy and postpartum.

Disorders  of  Unclear  Cause  Myalgic  encephalomyelitis  (ME)/
chronic  fatigue  syndrome  (CFS)  (Chap.  450)  and  fibromyalgia  
(Chap.  373)  incorporate  chronic  fatigue  as  part  of  the  syndromic 
definition when fatigue is present in association with other criteria, as 
discussed  in  the  respective  chapters.  Chronic  multisymptom  illness, 
also known as Gulf-War syndrome, is another symptom complex with 
prominent  fatigue;  it  is  most  commonly,  although  not  exclusively, 
observed in veterans of the 1991 Gulf War conflict (Chap. S7). Idio-
pathic chronic fatigue is used to describe the syndrome of unexplained 
chronic fatigue in the absence of enough additional clinical features to 
meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS.

Physical  Inactivity  Physical  inactivity  is  associated  with  fatigue, 
and increasing physical activity can improve fatigue in some patients.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Fatigue

Malnutrition  Although  fatigue  can  be  a  presenting  feature  of 
malnutrition  (Chap.  334),  nutritional  status  may  also  be  an  impor-
tant comorbidity and contributor to fatigue in other chronic illnesses, 
including cancer-associated fatigue.

Infection  Both  acute  and  chronic  infections  commonly  lead  to 
fatigue  as  part  of  the  broader  infectious  syndrome.  Evaluation  for 
undiagnosed infection as the cause of unexplained fatigue, and partic-
ularly prolonged or chronic fatigue, should be guided by the history, 
physical examination, and infectious risk factors, with particular atten-
tion to risk for tuberculosis, HIV, chronic hepatitis, and endocarditis. 
Infectious  mononucleosis  may  cause  prolonged  fatigue  that  persists 
for weeks to months following the acute illness, but infection with the 
Epstein-Barr virus is only very rarely the cause of unexplained chronic 
fatigue.  Postinfectious  fatigue  may  also  occur  following  a  variety  of 
acute infections. For example, a substantial minority of patients who 
have  recovered  from  SARS-CoV-1,  SARS-CoV-2,  and  Ebola  virus 
complain of persistent fatigue.

Drugs  Many  medications,  drugs,  drug  withdrawal,  and  chronic 
alcohol use can all lead to fatigue. Medications that are more likely to 

A  detailed  history  focusing  on  the  quality,  pattern,  time  course, 
associated symptoms, and alleviating factors of fatigue is necessary to 
define the syndrome and help direct further evaluation and treatment. 
It is important to determine if fatigue is the appropriate designation, 
whether  symptoms  are  acute  or  chronic,  and  if  the  impairment  is 
primarily mental, physical, or a combination of the two. The review 
of  systems  should  attempt  to  distinguish  fatigue  from  excessive 
sleepiness,  dyspnea  on  exertion,  exercise  intolerance,  and  muscle 
weakness.  The  presence  of  fever,  chills,  night  sweats,  or  weight 
loss  should  raise  suspicion  for  an  occult  infection  or  malignancy. 
A  careful  review  of  prescription,  over-the-counter,  herbal,  and 
recreational drug and alcohol use is required. Circumstances sur-
rounding the onset of symptoms and potential triggers should be 
investigated.  The  social  history  is  important,  with  attention  paid 
to  life  stressors  and  adverse  experiences,  workhours,  the  social 
support network, and domestic affairs including a screen for inti-
mate  partner  violence.  Sleep  habits  and  sleep  hygiene  should  be 
questioned. The impact of fatigue on daily functioning is important 
to understand the patient’s experience and gauge recovery and the 
success of treatment.

The  physical  examination  of  patients  with  fatigue  is  guided  by 
the  history  and  differential  diagnosis.  A  detailed  mental  status 
examination  should  be  performed  with  particular  attention  to 
symptoms of depression and anxiety. A formal neurologic exami-
nation is required to determine whether objective muscle weakness 
is  present.  This  is  usually  a  straightforward  exercise,  although 
occasionally  patients  with  fatigue  have  difficulty  sustaining  effort 
against resistance and sometimes report that generating full power 
requires substantial mental effort. On confrontational testing, full 
power may be generated for only a brief period before the patient 
suddenly gives way to the examiner. This type of weakness is often 
referred to as breakaway weakness and may or may not be associated 
with  pain.  This  is  contrasted  with  weakness  due  to  lesions  in  the 
motor tracts or lower motor unit, in which the patient’s resistance 
can  be  overcome  in  a  smooth  and  steady  fashion  and  full  power 
can  never  be  generated.  Occasionally,  a  patient  may  demonstrate 
fatigable  weakness,  in  which  power  is  full  when  first  tested  but 
becomes weak upon repeat evaluation without interval rest. Fatiga-
ble weakness, which usually indicates a problem of neuromuscular 
transmission,  never  has  the  sudden  breakaway  quality  that  one 
occasionally  observes  in  patients  with  fatigue.  If  the  presence  or 
absence of muscle weakness cannot be determined with the physi-
cal examination, electromyography with nerve conductions studies 
can be a helpful ancillary test.

The general physical examination should screen for signs of car-
diopulmonary disease, malignancy, lymphadenopathy, organomeg-
aly, infection, liver failure, kidney disease, malnutrition, endocrine 
abnormalities,  and  connective  tissue  disease.  In  patients  with 
associated  widespread  musculoskeletal  pain,  assessment  of  tender 
points  may  help  to  reveal  fibromyalgia.  Although  the  diagnostic 
yield of the general physical examination may be relatively low in 
the context of evaluation of unexplained chronic fatigue, elucidat-
ing the cause of only 2% of cases in one prospective analysis, the 
yield  of  a  detailed  neuropsychiatric  and  mental  status  evaluation 
is  likely  to  be  much  higher,  revealing  a  potential  explanation  for 
fatigue in up to 75–80% of patients in some series. Furthermore, a 
complete physical examination demonstrates a serious and system-
atic approach to the patient’s complaint and helps build trust and a 
therapeutic alliance.

Laboratory testing is likely to identify the cause of chronic fatigue 
in only about 5% of cases. Beyond a few standard screening tests, 
laboratory evaluation should be guided by the history and physical 
examination; extensive testing is likely to lead to incidental findings 
that  require  explanation  and  unnecessary  follow-up  investigation, 
and  should  be  avoided  in  lieu  of  frequent  clinical  follow-up.  A 
reasonable approach to screening includes a complete blood count 
with differential (to screen for anemia, infection, and malignancy), 
electrolytes  (including  sodium,  potassium,  and  calcium),  glucose, 
renal  function,  liver  function,  and  thyroid  function.  Testing  for 
HIV and adrenal function can also be considered. Published guide-
lines for chronic fatigue syndrome also recommend an erythrocyte 
sedimentation  rate  (ESR)  as  part  of  the  evaluation  for  mimics, 
but  unless  the  value  is  very  high,  such  nonspecific  testing  in  the 
absence of other features is unlikely to clarify the situation. Routine 
screening with an antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is also unlikely 
to be informative in isolation and is frequently positive at low titers 
in otherwise healthy adults. Additional unfocused studies, such as 
whole-body imaging scans, are usually not indicated; in addition to 
their inconvenience, potential risk, and cost, they often reveal unre-
lated incidental findings that can prolong the workup unnecessarily.

TREATMENT
Fatigue

The  first  priority  is  to  address  the  underlying  disorder  or  disor-
ders that account for fatigue, because this can be curative in select 
contexts and palliative in others. Unfortunately, in many chronic 

illnesses, fatigue may be refractory to traditional disease-modifying 
therapies, but it is nevertheless important in such cases to evaluate 
for other potential contributors because the cause may be multifac-
torial. Antidepressants (Chap. 452) may be helpful for treatment of 
chronic fatigue when symptoms of depression are present and are 
generally most effective as part of a multimodal approach. However, 
antidepressants can also cause fatigue and should be discontinued 
if they are not clearly effective. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has 
also been demonstrated to be helpful in ME/CFS as well as cancer- 
associated fatigue. Both cognitive-behavioral therapy and graded 
exercise therapy, in which physical exercise, most typically walk-
ing,  is  gradually  increased  with  attention  to  target  heart  rates  to 
avoid  overexertion,  were  shown  to  modestly  improve  walking 
times and self-reported fatigue measures when compared to stan-
dard medical care in patients in the United Kingdom with chronic 
fatigue. These benefits were maintained after a median follow-up 
of 2.5 years. Psychostimulants such as amphetamines, modafinil, 
and armodafinil can help increase alertness and concentration and 
reduce  excessive  daytime  sleepiness  in  certain  clinical  contexts, 
which  may  in  turn  help  with  symptoms  of  fatigue  in  a  minority 
of patients, but they have generally proven to be unhelpful in ran-
domized  trials  for  treating  fatigue  in  posttraumatic  brain  injury, 
Parkinson’s disease, cancer, and MS. In patients with low vitamin 
D  status,  vitamin  D  replacement  may  lead  to  improvement  in 
fatigue.

Development of more effective therapy for fatigue is hampered 
by limited knowledge of the biologic basis of this symptom, includ-
ing how fatigue is detected and registered in the nervous system. 
Proinflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  interleukin  1α  and  1β  and 
tumor  necrosis  factor  α,  might  mediate  fatigue  in  some  patients. 
While preliminary studies of biologic therapies that inhibit cytok-
ines  have  suggested  a  benefit  against  fatigue  in  some  patients 
with  inflammatory  conditions,  this  approach  has  largely  not  led 
to  improvement  in  clinical  trials  that  focused  on  fatigue  as  the 
primary  endpoint.  Nonetheless,  specific  targeting  with  cytokine 
antagonists  could  represent  a  possible  future  approach  for  some 
patients.

 ■ PROGNOSIS
Acute fatigue significant enough to require medical evaluation is more 
likely to lead to an identifiable medical, neurologic, or psychiatric cause 
than is unexplained chronic fatigue. Evaluation of unexplained chronic 
fatigue  most  commonly  leads  to  diagnosis  of  a  psychiatric  condition 
or  remains  unexplained.  Identification  of  a  previously  undiagnosed 
serious or life-threatening culprit etiology is rare, even with longitudi-
nal follow-up of patients with unexplained chronic fatigue. Complete 
resolution is uncommon, at least over the short term, but multidisci-
plinary treatment approaches can lead to symptomatic improvements 
that substantially improve quality of life.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases24 Neurologic Causes of 
Weakness and Paralysis
Stephen L. Hauser

Normal motor function involves integrated muscle activity that is mod-
ulated by the activity of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, 
red nucleus, brainstem reticular formation, lateral vestibular nucleus, 
and spinal cord. Motor system dysfunction leads to weakness or paral-
ysis,  discussed  in  this  chapter,  or  to  ataxia  (Chap.  439)  or  abnormal 
movements  (Chap.  436).  Weakness  is  a  reduction  in  the  power  that 
can be exerted by one or more muscles. It must be distinguished from 
increased  fatigability  (i.e.,  the  inability  to  sustain  the  performance  of 
an  activity  that  should  be  normal  for  a  person  of  the  same  age,  sex, 
and  size),  limitation  in  function  due  to  pain  or  articular  stiffness,  or 
impaired motor activity because severe proprioceptive sensory loss pre-
vents adequate feedback information about the direction and power of 
movements.  It  is  also  distinct  from  bradykinesia  (in  which  increased 
time is required for full power to be exerted) and apraxia, a disorder 
of planning and initiating a skilled or learned movement unrelated to a 
significant motor or sensory deficit (Chap. 30).

Paralysis or the suffix “-plegia” indicates weakness so severe that a 
muscle cannot be contracted at all, whereas paresis refers to less severe 
weakness. The prefix “hemi-” refers to one-half of the body, “para-” to 
both legs, and “quadri-” to all four limbs.

The distribution of weakness helps to localize the underlying lesion. 
Weakness from involvement of upper motor neurons occurs particu-
larly in the extensors and abductors of the upper limb and the flexors 
of the lower limb. Lower motor neuron weakness depends on whether 
involvement is at the level of the anterior horn cells, nerve root, limb 
plexus,  or  peripheral  nerve—only  muscles  supplied  by  the  affected 
structure are weak. Myopathic weakness is generally most marked in 
proximal muscles. Weakness from impaired neuromuscular transmis-
sion has no specific pattern of involvement.

Weakness often is accompanied by other neurologic abnormalities 

that help indicate the site of the responsible lesion (Table 24-1).

Tone is the resistance of a muscle to passive stretch. Increased tone 
may be of several types. Spasticity is the increase in tone associated with 
disease of upper motor neurons. It is velocity dependent, has a sudden 
release  after  reaching  a  maximum  (the  “clasp-knife”  phenomenon), 
and  predominantly  affects  the  antigravity  muscles  (i.e.,  upper-limb 
flexors and lower-limb extensors). Rigidity is hypertonia that is present 
throughout the range of motion (a “lead pipe” or “plastic” stiffness) and 
affects flexors and extensors equally; it sometimes has a cogwheel qual-
ity that is enhanced by voluntary movement of the contralateral limb 
(reinforcement). Rigidity occurs with certain extrapyramidal disorders, 
such as Parkinson’s disease. Paratonia (or gegenhalten) is increased tone 
that varies irregularly in a manner seemingly related to the degree of 
relaxation, is present throughout the range of motion, and affects flex-
ors and extensors equally; it usually results from disease of the frontal 
lobes. Weakness with decreased tone (flaccidity) or normal tone occurs 
with disorders of motor units. A motor unit consists of a single lower 
motor neuron and all the muscle fibers that it innervates.

Muscle bulk generally is not affected by upper motor neuron lesions, 
although mild disuse atrophy eventually may occur. By contrast, atro-
phy is often conspicuous when a lower motor neuron lesion is respon-
sible for weakness and also may occur with advanced muscle disease.

Muscle  stretch  (tendon)  reflexes  are  usually  increased  with  upper 
motor  neuron  lesions  but  may  be  decreased  or  absent  for  a  variable 
period  immediately  after  onset  of  an  acute  lesion.  Hyperreflexia  is 
usually—but not invariably—accompanied by loss of cutaneous reflexes 
(such as superficial abdominals; Chap. 422) and, in particular, by an 
extensor  plantar  (Babinski)  response.  The  muscle  stretch  reflexes  are 
depressed with lower motor neuron lesions directly involving specific 
reflex  arcs.  They  generally  are  preserved  in  patients  with  myopathic 
weakness except in advanced stages, when they sometimes are atten-
uated.  In  disorders  of  the  neuromuscular  junction,  reflex  responses 
may  be  affected  by  preceding  voluntary  activity  of  affected  muscles; 
such activity may lead to enhancement of initially depressed reflexes in 
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and, conversely, to depression of 
initially normal reflexes in myasthenia gravis (Chap. 448).

The  distinction  of  neuropathic  (lower  motor  neuron)  from  myo-
pathic weakness is sometimes difficult clinically, although distal weak-
ness  is  likely  to  be  neuropathic,  and  symmetric  proximal  weakness 
myopathic. Fasciculations (visible or palpable twitches within a muscle 
due to the spontaneous discharge of a motor unit) and early atrophy 
indicate that weakness is neuropathic.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS
Upper  Motor  Neuron  Weakness  Lesions  of  the  upper  motor 
neurons or their descending axons to the spinal cord (Fig. 24-1) pro-
duce weakness through decreased activation of lower motor neurons. 
In general, distal muscle groups are affected more severely than prox-
imal ones, and axial movements are spared unless the lesion is severe 
and bilateral. Spasticity is typical but may not be present acutely. Rapid 
repetitive movements are slowed and coarse, but normal rhythmicity is 
maintained. With corticobulbar involvement, weakness occurs in the 
lower face and tongue; extraocular, upper facial, pharyngeal, and jaw 
muscles are typically spared. Bilateral corticobulbar lesions produce a 
pseudobulbar  palsy:  dysarthria,  dysphagia,  dysphonia,  and  emotional 
lability  accompany  bilateral  facial  weakness  and  a  brisk  jaw  jerk. 
Electromyogram (EMG) (Chap. 446) shows that with weakness of the 
upper  motor  neuron  type,  motor  units  have  a  diminished  maximal 
discharge frequency.

Lower Motor Neuron Weakness  This pattern results from dis-
orders of lower motor neurons in the brainstem motor nuclei and the 
anterior horn of the spinal cord or from dysfunction of the axons of 
these neurons as they pass to skeletal muscle (Fig. 24-2). Weakness is 
due to a decrease in the number of muscle fibers that can be activated 
through a loss of α motor neurons or disruption of their connections to 
muscle. Loss of γ motor neurons does not cause weakness but decreases 
tension on the muscle spindles, which decreases muscle tone and atten-
uates the stretch reflexes. An absent stretch reflex suggests involvement 
of spindle afferent fibers.

When  a  motor  unit  becomes  diseased,  especially  in  anterior  horn 
cell diseases, it may discharge spontaneously, producing fasciculations. 
When  α  motor  neurons  or  their  axons  degenerate,  the  denervated 
muscle fibers also may discharge spontaneously. These single muscle

FIGURE  24-1  The  corticospinal  and  bulbospinal  upper  motor  neuron  pathways. 
Upper motor neurons have their cell bodies in layer V of the primary motor cortex 
(the precentral gyrus, or Brodmann area 4) and in the premotor and supplemental 
motor  cortex  (area  6).  The  upper  motor  neurons  in  the  primary  motor  cortex 
are  somatotopically  organized  (right  side  of  figure).  Axons  of  the  upper  motor 
neurons  descend  through  the  subcortical  white  matter  and  the  posterior  limb  of 
the  internal  capsule.  Axons  of  the  pyramidal  or  corticospinal  system  descend 
through the brainstem in the cerebral peduncle of the midbrain, the basis pontis, 
and the medullary pyramids. At the cervicomedullary junction, most corticospinal 
axons  decussate  into  the  contralateral  corticospinal  tract  of  the  lateral  spinal 
cord,  but  10–30%  remain  ipsilateral  in  the  anterior  spinal  cord.  Corticospinal 
neurons synapse on premotor interneurons, but some—especially in the cervical 
enlargement  and  those  connecting  with  motor  neurons  to  distal  limb  muscles—
make direct monosynaptic connections with lower motor neurons. They innervate 
most  densely  the  lower  motor  neurons  of  hand  muscles  and  are  involved  in 
the  execution  of  learned,  fine  movements.  Corticobulbar  neurons  are  similar  to 
corticospinal  neurons  but  innervate  brainstem  motor  nuclei.  Bulbospinal  upper 
motor neurons influence strength and tone but are not part of the pyramidal system. 
The descending ventromedial bulbospinal pathways originate in the tectum of the 
midbrain (tectospinal pathway), the vestibular nuclei (vestibulospinal pathway), and 
the reticular formation (reticulospinal pathway). These pathways influence axial and 
proximal muscles and are involved in the maintenance of posture and integrated 
movements  of  the  limbs  and  trunk.  The  descending  ventrolateral  bulbospinal 
pathways, which originate predominantly in the red nucleus (rubrospinal pathway), 
facilitate distal limb muscles. The bulbospinal system sometimes is referred to as 
the extrapyramidal upper motor neuron system. In all figures, nerve cell bodies and 
axon terminals are shown, respectively, as closed circles and forks.

fiber  discharges,  or  fibrillation  potentials,  cannot  be  seen  but  can  be 
recorded  with  EMG.  Weakness  leads  to  delayed  or  reduced  recruit-
ment of motor units, with fewer than normal activated at a particular 
discharge frequency.

Neuromuscular  Junction  Weakness  Disorders  of  the  neuro-
muscular junction produce weakness of variable degree and distribu-
tion. The number of muscle fibers that are activated varies over time, 
depending on the state of rest of the neuromuscular junctions. Strength

FIGURE  24-2  Lower  motor  neurons  are  divided  into  `  and  f  types.  The  larger  α 
motor neurons are more numerous and innervate the extrafusal muscle fibers of 
the motor unit. Loss of α motor neurons or disruption of their axons produces lower 
motor  neuron  weakness.  The  smaller,  less  numerous  γ  motor  neurons  innervate 
the  intrafusal  muscle  fibers  of  the  muscle  spindle  and  contribute  to  normal  tone 
and  stretch  reflexes.  The  α  motor  neuron  receives  direct  excitatory  input  from 
corticomotoneurons  and  primary  muscle  spindle  afferents.  The  α  and  γ  motor 
neurons also receive excitatory input from other descending upper motor neuron 
pathways,  segmental  sensory  inputs,  and  interneurons.  The  α  motor  neurons 
receive  direct  inhibition  from  Renshaw  cell  interneurons,  and  other  interneurons 
indirectly  inhibit  the  α  and  γ  motor  neurons.  A  muscle  stretch  (tendon)  reflex 
requires the function of all the illustrated structures. A tap on a tendon stretches 
muscle spindles (which are tonically activated by γ motor neurons) and activates 
the primary spindle afferent neurons. These neurons stimulate the α motor neurons 
in the spinal cord, producing a brief muscle contraction, which is the familiar tendon 
reflex.

is influenced by preceding activity of the affected muscle. In myasthe-
nia gravis, for example, sustained or repeated contractions of affected 
muscle decline in strength despite continuing effort (Chap. 440). Thus, 
fatigable  weakness  is  suggestive  of  disorders  of  the  neuromuscular 
junction, which cause functional loss of muscle fibers due to failure of 
their activation.

Myopathic  Weakness  Myopathic  weakness  is  produced  by  a 
decrease  in  the  number  or  contractile  force  of  muscle  fibers  acti-
vated  within  motor  units.  With  muscular  dystrophies,  inflammatory 
myopathies, or myopathies with muscle fiber necrosis, the number of 
muscle fibers is reduced within many motor units. On EMG, the size 
of each motor unit action potential is decreased, and motor units must 
be recruited more rapidly than normal to produce the desired power. 
Some myopathies produce weakness through loss of contractile force 
of muscle fibers or through relatively selective involvement of type II 
(fast)  fibers.  These  myopathies  may  not  affect  the  size  of  individual 
motor unit action potentials and are detected by a discrepancy between 
the electrical activity and force of a muscle.

Psychogenic  Weakness  Weakness  may  occur  without  a  recog-
nizable organic basis. It tends to be variable, inconsistent, and with a 
pattern  of  distribution  that  cannot  be  explained  on  a  neuroanatomic 
basis. On formal testing, antagonists may contract when the patient is 
supposedly activating the agonist muscle. The severity of weakness is 
out of keeping with the patient’s daily activities.
 ■ DISTRIBUTION OF WEAKNESS
Hemiparesis  Hemiparesis  results  from  an  upper  motor  neuron 
lesion above the midcervical spinal cord; most such lesions are above 
the foramen magnum. The presence of other neurologic deficits helps 
localize  the  lesion.  Thus  language  disorders,  for  example,  point  to  a 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   166

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasescortical lesion. Homonymous visual field defects reflect either a corti-
cal or a subcortical hemispheric lesion. A “pure motor” hemiparesis of 
the face, arm, and leg often is due to a small, discrete lesion in the pos-
terior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncle in the midbrain, 
or  upper  pons.  Some  brainstem  lesions  produce  “crossed  paralyses,” 
consisting of ipsilateral cranial nerve signs and contralateral hemipa-
resis (Chap. 426). The absence of cranial nerve signs or facial weak-
ness suggests that a hemiparesis is due to a lesion in the high cervical 
spinal  cord,  especially  if  associated  with  Brown-Séquard  syndrome, 
consisting of loss of joint position and vibration sense on the side of 
the weakness, and loss of pain and temperature sense on the opposite 
side (Chap. 442).

Acute or episodic hemiparesis usually results from focal structural 
lesions,  particularly  vascular  etiologies,  rapidly  expanding  lesions,  or 
an inflammatory process. Subacute hemiparesis that evolves over days 
or  weeks  may  relate  to  subdural  hematoma,  infectious  or  inflamma-
tory disorders (e.g., cerebral abscess, fungal granuloma or meningitis, 
parasitic infection, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis), or primary or meta-
static neoplasms. AIDS may present with subacute hemiparesis due to 
toxoplasmosis  or  primary  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  lymphoma. 
Chronic hemiparesis that evolves over months usually is due to a neo-
plasm  or  vascular  malformation,  a  chronic  subdural  hematoma,  or  a 
degenerative disease.

Investigation of hemiparesis (Fig. 24-3) of acute origin usually starts 
with a CT scan of the brain and laboratory studies. If the CT is normal, 
or in subacute or chronic cases of hemiparesis, MRI of the brain and/or 
cervical spine (including the foramen magnum) is performed, depend-
ing on the clinical accompaniments.

Paraparesis  Acute  paraparesis  is  caused  most  commonly  by  an 
intraspinal lesion, but its spinal origin may not be recognized initially 
if the legs are flaccid and areflexic. Usually, however, there is sensory 
loss in the legs with an upper level on the trunk; a dissociated sensory 
loss (loss of pain and temperature but not touch, position, and vibra-
tion sense) suggestive of a central cord syndrome; or hyperreflexia in 
the  legs  with  normal  reflexes  in  the  arms  (Chap.  442).  Imaging  the

spinal cord (Fig. 24-3) may reveal compressive lesions, infarction (pro-
prioception usually is spared), arteriovenous fistulas or other vascular 
anomalies, or transverse myelitis (Chap. 442).

Diseases of the cerebral hemispheres that produce acute parapare-
sis  include  anterior  cerebral  artery  ischemia  (shoulder  shrug  also  is 
affected),  superior  sagittal  sinus  or  cortical  venous  thrombosis,  and 
acute hydrocephalus.

Paraparesis  may  also  result  from  a  cauda  equina  syndrome,  for 
example,  after  trauma  to  the  low  back,  a  midline  disk  herniation,  or 
an intraspinal tumor. The sphincters are commonly affected, whereas 
hip flexion often is spared, as is sensation over the anterolateral thighs. 
Rarely,  paraparesis  is  caused  by  a  rapidly  evolving  anterior  horn  cell 
disease  (such  as  poliovirus  or  West  Nile  virus  infection),  peripheral 
neuropathy (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome; Chap. 447), or myop-
athy (Chap. 449).

Subacute or chronic spastic paraparesis is caused by upper motor 
neuron  disease.  When  associated  with  lower-limb  sensory  loss  and 
sphincter involvement, a chronic spinal cord disorder should be con-
sidered  (Chap.  442).  If  hemispheric  signs  are  present,  a  parasagittal 
meningioma or chronic hydrocephalus is likely. The absence of spas-
ticity in a long-standing paraparesis suggests a lower motor neuron or 
myopathic etiology.

Investigations  typically  begin  with  spinal  MRI,  but  when  upper 
motor  neuron  signs  are  associated  with  drowsiness,  confusion,  sei-
zures, or other hemispheric signs, brain MRI should also be performed, 
sometimes  as  the  initial  investigation.  Electrophysiologic  studies  are 
diagnostically  helpful  when  clinical  findings  suggest  an  underlying 
neuromuscular disorder.

Quadriparesis or Generalized Weakness  Generalized weakness 
may be due to disorders of the CNS or the motor unit. Although the terms 
often  are  used  interchangeably,  quadriparesis  is  commonly  used  when 
an upper motor neuron cause is suspected, and generalized weakness is 
used  when  a  disease  of  the  motor  units  is  likely.  Weakness  from  CNS 
disorders usually is associated with changes in consciousness or cognition 
and accompanied by spasticity, hyperreflexia, and sensory disturbances. 
Most neuromuscular causes of generalized 
weakness are associated with normal men-
tal  function,  hypotonia,  and  hypoactive 
muscle stretch reflexes. The major causes 
of  intermittent  weakness  are  listed  in  
Table  24-2.  A  patient  with  generalized 
fatigability  without  objective  weakness 
may  have  chronic  fatigue  syndrome 
(Chap. 450).
ACUTE  QUADRIPARESIS  Quadriparesis 
with onset over minutes may result from 
disorders  of  upper  motor  neurons  (such 
as from anoxia, hypotension, brainstem or 
cervical  cord  ischemia,  trauma,  and  sys-
temic metabolic abnormalities) or muscle 
(electrolyte  disturbances,  certain  inborn 
errors of muscle energy metabolism, tox-
ins,  and  periodic  paralyses).  Onset  over 
hours to weeks may, in addition to these 
disorders,  be  due  to  lower  motor  neu-
ron disorders such as Guillain-Barré syn-
drome (Chap. 447).

cord.  If  weakness  is  lower  motor  neu-
ron,  myopathic,  or  uncertain  in  origin, 
the  clinical  approach  begins  with  blood 
studies to determine the level of muscle 
enzymes and electrolytes and with EMG 
and nerve conduction studies.

SUBACUTE OR CHRONIC QUADRIPARESIS  Quadriparesis due to upper 
motor neuron disease may develop over weeks to years from chronic 
myelopathies, multiple sclerosis, brain or spinal tumors, chronic sub-
dural hematomas, and various metabolic, toxic, and infectious disor-
ders.  It  may  also  result  from  lower  motor  neuron  disease,  a  chronic 
neuropathy  (in  which  weakness  is  often  most  profound  distally),  or 
myopathic weakness (typically proximal).

When quadriparesis develops acutely in obtunded patients, evalua-
tion begins with a CT scan of the brain. If upper motor neuron signs 
have developed acutely but the patient is alert, the initial test is usually 
an MRI of the cervical cord. When onset has been gradual, disorders of 
the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and cervical spinal cord can usu-
ally be distinguished clinically, and imaging is directed first at the clin-
ically suspected site of pathology. If weakness is lower motor neuron, 
myopathic,  or  uncertain  in  origin,  laboratory  studies  can  determine 
the  levels  of  muscle  enzymes  and  electrolytes,  and  EMG  and  nerve 
conduction studies help to localize the pathologic process (Chap. 449).

Monoparesis  Monoparesis  usually  is  due  to  lower  motor  neuron 
disease, with or without associated sensory involvement. Upper motor 
neuron weakness occasionally presents as a monoparesis of distal and 
nonantigravity  muscles.  Myopathic  weakness  rarely  is  limited  to  one 
limb.
ACUTE  MONOPARESIS  If  weakness  is  predominantly  distal  and  of 
upper motor neuron type and is not associated with sensory impair-
ment or pain, focal cortical ischemia is likely (Chap. 427); diagnostic 
possibilities  are  similar  to  those  for  acute  hemiparesis.  Sensory  loss 
and  pain  usually  accompany  acute  lower  motor  neuron  weakness; 
the weakness commonly localizes to a single nerve root or peripheral 
nerve,  but  occasionally  reflects  plexus  involvement.  If  lower  motor 
neuron  weakness  is  likely,  evaluation  begins  with  EMG  and  nerve 
conduction studies.
SUBACUTE  OR  CHRONIC  MONOPARESIS  Weakness  and  atrophy  that 
develop  over  weeks  or  months  are  usually  of  lower  motor  neuron 
origin.  When  associated  with  sensory  symptoms,  a  peripheral  cause 
(nerve, root, or plexus) is likely; otherwise, anterior horn cell disease 
should be considered. In either case, an electrodiagnostic study is indi-
cated. If weakness is of the upper motor neuron type, a discrete cortical 
(precentral gyrus) or cord lesion may be responsible, and appropriate 
imaging is performed.

Distal Weakness 
Involvement of two or more limbs distally sug-
gests  lower  motor  neuron  or  peripheral  nerve  disease.  Acute  distal 
lower-limb weakness results occasionally from an acute toxic polyneu-
ropathy or cauda equina syndrome. Distal symmetric weakness usually 
develops  over  weeks,  months,  or  years  and,  when  associated  with 
numbness, is due to peripheral neuropathy (Chap. 446). Anterior horn 

cell disease may begin distally but is typically asymmetric and without 
accompanying numbness (Chap. 437). Rarely, myopathies present with 
distal weakness (Chap. 449). Electrodiagnostic studies help localize the 
disorder (Fig. 24-3).

Proximal  Weakness  Myopathy  often  produces  symmetric  weak-
ness of the pelvic or shoulder girdle muscles (Chap. 449). Diseases of 
the  neuromuscular  junction,  such  as  myasthenia  gravis  (Chap. 448), 
may present with symmetric proximal weakness often associated with 
ptosis,  diplopia,  or  bulbar  weakness  and  fluctuate  in  severity  during 
the  day.  In  anterior  horn  cell  disease,  proximal  weakness  is  usually 
asymmetric,  but  it  may  be  symmetric  especially  in  genetic  forms. 
Numbness does not occur with any of these diseases. The evaluation 
usually  begins  with  determination  of  the  serum  creatine  kinase  level 
and electrophysiologic studies.

Weakness  in  a  Restricted  Distribution  Weakness  may  not  fit 
any  of  these  patterns,  being  limited,  for  example,  to  the  extraocular, 
hemifacial, bulbar, or respiratory muscles. If it is unilateral, restricted 
weakness usually is due to lower motor neuron or peripheral nerve dis-
ease, such as in a facial palsy. Weakness of part of a limb is commonly 
due  to  a  peripheral  nerve  lesion  such  as  an  entrapment  neuropathy. 
Relatively  symmetric  weakness  of  extraocular  or  bulbar  muscles  fre-
quently is due to a myopathy (Chap. 449) or neuromuscular junction 
disorder  (Chap.  448).  Bilateral  facial  palsy  with  areflexia  suggests  
Guillain-Barré  syndrome  (Chap.  447).  Worsening  of  relatively  sym-
metric weakness with fatigue is characteristic of neuromuscular junc-
tion  disorders.  Asymmetric  bulbar  weakness  usually  is  due  to  motor 
neuron disease. Weakness limited to respiratory muscles is uncommon 
and  usually  is  due  to  motor  neuron  disease,  myasthenia  gravis,  or  
polymyositis/dermatomyositis (Chap. 365).

25 Numbness, Tingling,  
and Sensory Loss
Stephen L. Hauser

Normal  somatic  sensation  reflects  a  continuous  monitoring  process, 
little  of  which  reaches  consciousness  under  ordinary  conditions.  By 
contrast,  disordered  sensation,  particularly  when  experienced  as 
painful, is alarming and dominates the patient’s attention. Physicians 
should  be  able  to  recognize  abnormal  sensations  by  how  they  are 
described,  know  their  type  and  likely  site  of  origin,  and  understand 
their implications. Pain is considered separately in Chap. 13.
 ■ POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS
Abnormal  sensory  symptoms  can  be  divided  into  two  categories: 
positive  and  negative.  The  prototypical  positive  symptom  is  tingling 
(pins and needles); other positive sensory phenomena include itch and 
altered sensations that are described as pricking, bandlike, lightning-like  
shooting  feelings  (lancinations),  aching,  knifelike,  twisting,  drawing,

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasespulling,  tightening,  burning,  searing,  electrical,  or  raw  feelings.  Such 
symptoms are often painful.

Positive phenomena usually result from trains of impulses generated 
at sites of lowered threshold or heightened excitability along a periph-
eral or central sensory pathway. The nature and severity of the abnor-
mal sensation depend on the number, rate, timing, and distribution of 
ectopic impulses and the type and function of nervous tissue in which 
they arise. Because positive phenomena represent excessive activity in 
sensory  pathways,  they  are  not  necessarily  associated  with  a  sensory 
deficit (loss) on examination.

Negative  phenomena  represent  loss  of  sensory  function  and  are 
characterized by diminished or absent feeling that often is experienced 
as  numbness  and  by  abnormal  findings  on  sensory  examination.  In 
disorders affecting peripheral sensation, at least one-half of the afferent 
axons  innervating  a  particular  site  are  probably  lost  or  functionless 
before a sensory deficit can be demonstrated by clinical examination. If 
the rate of loss is slow, however, lack of cutaneous feeling may be unno-
ticed by the patient and difficult to demonstrate on examination, even 
though few sensory fibers are functioning; if it is rapid, both positive 
and negative phenomena are usually conspicuous. Subclinical degrees 
of sensory dysfunction may be revealed by sensory nerve conduction 
studies or somatosensory-evoked potentials.

Whereas  sensory  symptoms  may  be  either  positive  or  negative, 
sensory  signs  on  examination  are  always  a  measure  of  negative 
phenomena.

 ■ TERMINOLOGY
Paresthesias and dysesthesias are general terms used to denote positive 
sensory symptoms. The term paresthesias typically refers to tingling or 
pins-and-needles  sensations  but  may  include  a  wide  variety  of  other 
abnormal sensations, except pain; it sometimes implies that the abnor-
mal  sensations  are  perceived  spontaneously.  The  more  general  term 
dysesthesias denotes all types of abnormal sensations, including painful 
ones, regardless of whether a stimulus is evident.

Another  set  of  terms  refers  to  sensory  abnormalities  found  on 
examination.  Hypesthesia  or  hypoesthesia  refers  to  a  reduction  of 
cutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing such as pressure, light 
touch,  and  warm  or  cold  stimuli;  anesthesia,  to  a  complete  absence 
of  skin  sensation  to  the  same  stimuli  plus  pinprick;  and  hypalgesia 
or  analgesia,  to  reduced  or  absent  pain  perception  (nociception). 
Hyperesthesia means pain or increased sensitivity in response to touch. 
Similarly, allodynia describes the situation in which a nonpainful stim-
ulus, once perceived, is experienced as painful, even excruciating. An 
example is elicitation of a painful sensation by application of a vibrating 
tuning fork. Hyperalgesia denotes severe pain in response to a mildly 
noxious stimulus, and hyperpathia, a broad term, encompasses all the 
phenomena  described  by  hyperesthesia,  allodynia,  and  hyperalgesia. 
With hyperpathia, the threshold for a sensory stimulus is increased and 
perception is delayed, but once felt, it is unduly painful.

Disorders of deep sensation arising from muscle spindles, tendons, 
and  joints  affect  proprioception  (position  sense).  Manifestations 
include  imbalance  (particularly  with  eyes  closed  or  in  the  dark), 
clumsiness  of  precision  movements,  and  unsteadiness  of  gait,  which 
are referred to collectively as sensory ataxia. Other findings on exami-
nation  usually,  but  not  invariably,  include  reduced  or  absent  joint 
position and vibratory sensibility and absent deep tendon reflexes in 
the affected limbs. The Romberg sign is positive, which means that the 
patient sways markedly or topples when asked to stand with feet close 
together and eyes closed. In severe states of deafferentation involving 
deep sensation, the patient cannot walk or stand unaided or even sit 
unsupported. Continuous involuntary movements (pseudoathetosis) of 
the outstretched hands and fingers occur, particularly with eyes closed.

 ■ ANATOMY OF SENSATION
Cutaneous  receptors  are  classified  by  the  type  of  stimulus  that  opti-
mally excites them. They consist of naked nerve endings (nociceptors, 
which  respond  to  tissue-damaging  stimuli,  and  thermoreceptors, 
which  respond  to  noninjurious  thermal  stimuli)  and  encapsulated 
terminals  (several  types  of  mechanoreceptor,  activated  by  physical 

deformation of the skin or stretch of muscles). Each type of receptor 
has its own set of sensitivities to specific stimuli, size and distinctness 
of receptive fields, and adaptational qualities.

Afferent peripheral nerve fibers conveying somatosensory informa-
tion from the limbs and trunk traverse the dorsal roots and enter the 
dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Fig. 25-1); the cell bodies of first-order 
neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In an analogous 
fashion, sensations from the face and head are conveyed through the 
trigeminal system (Fig. 441-2). Once fiber tracts enter the spinal cord, 
the  polysynaptic  projections  of  the  smaller  fibers  (unmyelinated  and 
small  myelinated),  which  subserve  mainly  nociception,  itch,  temper-
ature sensibility, and touch, cross and ascend in the opposite anterior 
and lateral columns of the spinal cord, through the brainstem, to the 
ventral  posterolateral  (VPL)  nucleus  of  the  thalamus  and  ultimately 
project to the postcentral gyrus of the parietal cortex and other cortical 
areas  (Chap.  13).  This  is  the  spinothalamic  pathway  or  anterolateral 
system.  The  larger  fibers,  which  subserve  tactile  and  position  sense 
and  kinesthesia,  project  rostrally  in  the  posterior  and  posterolateral 
columns on the same side of the spinal cord and make their first syn-
apse in the gracile or cuneate nucleus of the lower medulla. Axons of 
second-order  neurons  decussate  and  ascend  in  the  medial  lemniscus 
located medially in the medulla and in the tegmentum of the pons and 
midbrain and synapse in the VPL nucleus; third-order neurons project 
to  parietal  cortex  as  well  as  to  other  cortical  areas.  This  large-fiber 
system is referred to as the posterior column–medial lemniscal pathway 
(lemniscal,  for  short).  Although  the  fiber  types  and  functions  that 
make  up  the  spinothalamic  and  lemniscal  systems  are  relatively  well 
known,  many  other  fibers,  particularly  those  associated  with  touch, 
pressure, and position sense, ascend in a diffusely distributed pattern 
both ipsilaterally and contralaterally in the anterolateral quadrants of 
the spinal cord. This explains why a complete lesion of the posterior 
columns of the spinal cord may be associated with little sensory deficit 
on examination.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Clinical Examination of Sensation

The main components of the sensory examination are tests of pri-
mary sensation (pain, touch, vibration, joint position, and thermal 
sensation)  (Table  25-1).  The  examiner  must  depend  on  patient 
responses,  and  this  complicates  interpretation.  Further,  examina-
tion  may  be  limited  in  some  patients.  In  a  stuporous  patient,  for 
example, sensory examination is reduced to observing the briskness 
of withdrawal in response to a pinch or another noxious stimulus. 
Comparison of responses on the two sides of the body is essential. 
In  an  alert  but  uncooperative  patient,  it  may  not  be  possible  to 
examine  cutaneous  sensation,  but  some  idea  of  proprioceptive 
function may be gained by noting the patient’s best performance of 
movements requiring balance and precision.

In patients with sensory complaints, testing should begin in the 
center of the affected region and proceed radially until sensation is 
perceived as normal. The distribution of any abnormality is defined 
and compared to root and peripheral nerve territories (Figs. 25-2 
and 25-3). Some patients present with sensory symptoms that do 
not fit an anatomic localization and are accompanied by either no 
abnormalities or gross inconsistencies on examination. The exam-
iner should consider in such cases the possibility of a psychologic 
cause (see “Psychogenic Symptoms,” below). Sensory examination 
of  a  patient  who  has  no  neurologic  complaints  can  be  brief  and 
consist of pinprick, touch, and vibration testing in the hands and 
feet  plus  evaluation  of  stance  and  gait,  including  the  Romberg 
maneuver (Chap. V6). Evaluation of stance and gait also tests the 
integrity of motor and cerebellar systems. 
PRIMARY SENSATION
The sense of pain usually is tested with a clean pin, which is then 
discarded. The patient is asked to close the eyes and focus on the 
pricking or unpleasant quality of the stimulus, not just the pressure

or touch sensation elicited. Areas of hypalgesia should be mapped 
by proceeding radially from the most hypalgesic site. Temperature 
sensation to both hot and cold is best tested with small containers 
filled with water of the desired temperature. An alternative way to 
test cold sensation is to touch a metal object, such as a tuning fork 

at room temperature, to the skin. For testing warm temperatures, 
the tuning fork or another metal object may be held under warm 
water of the desired temperature and then used. The appreciation 
of both cold and warmth should be tested because different recep-
tors respond to each. Touch usually is tested with a wisp of cotton,

minimizing  pressure  on  the  skin.  In  general,  it  is  better  to  avoid 
testing touch on hairy skin because of the profusion of the sensory 
endings that surround each hair follicle. The patient is tested with 
the eyes closed and should respond as soon as the stimulus is per-
ceived, indicating its location.

Joint  position  testing  is  a  measure  of  proprioception.  With  the 
patient’s  eyes  closed,  joint  position  is  tested  in  the  distal  inter-
phalangeal  joint  of  the  great  toe  and  fingers.  The  digit  is  held 
by  its  sides,  distal  to  the  joint  being  tested,  and  moved  passively 
while more proximal joints are stabilized—the patient indicates the 
change  in  position  or  direction  of  movement.  If  errors  are  made, 
more  proximal  joints  are  tested.  A  test  of  proximal  joint  position 
sense, primarily at the shoulder, is performed by asking the patient 
to  bring  the  two  index  fingers  together  with  arms  extended  and 
eyes closed. Normal individuals can do this accurately, with errors 
of 1 cm or less.

The  sense  of  vibration  is  tested  with  an  oscillating  tuning  fork 
that vibrates at 128 Hz. Vibration is tested over bony points, begin-
ning distally; in the feet, it is tested over the dorsal surface of the 
distal phalanx of the big toes and at the malleoli of the ankles, and in 
the hands, it is tested dorsally at the distal phalanx of the fingers. If 
abnormalities are found, more proximal sites should be examined. 
Vibratory thresholds at the same site in the patient and the exam-
iner may be compared for control purposes. 

CORTICAL SENSATION
The most commonly used tests of cortical function are two-point 
discrimination, touch localization, and bilateral simultaneous stim-
ulation, and tests for graphesthesia and stereognosis. Abnormalities

of these sensory tests, in the presence of normal primary sensation 
in an alert cooperative patient, signify a lesion of the parietal cortex 
or thalamocortical projections. If primary sensation is altered, these 
cortical  discriminative  functions  usually  will  be  abnormal  also. 
Comparisons  should  always  be  made  between  analogous  sites  on 
the two sides of the body because the deficit with a specific parietal 
lesion is likely to be unilateral.

Two-point discrimination can be tested with calipers, the points 
of which may be set from 2 mm to several centimeters apart and 
then applied simultaneously to the test site. On the fingertips, a nor-
mal individual can distinguish about a 3-mm separation of points.
Touch localization is performed by light pressure for an instant 
with the examiner’s fingertip or a wisp of cotton wool; the patient, 
whose eyes are closed, is required to identify the site of touch. Bilat-
eral simultaneous stimulation at analogous sites (e.g., the dorsum of 
both hands) can be carried out to determine whether the percep-
tion of touch is extinguished consistently on one side (extinction or 
neglect). Graphesthesia refers to the capacity to recognize, with eyes 
closed, letters or numbers drawn by the examiner’s fingertip on the 
palm  of  the  hand.  Once  again,  interside  comparison  is  of  prime 
importance.  Inability  to  recognize  numbers  or  letters  is  termed 
agraphesthesia.

Stereognosis refers to the ability to identify common objects by 
palpation,  recognizing  their  shape,  texture,  and  size.  Common 
standard objects such as keys, paper clips, and coins are best used. 
Patients  with  normal  stereognosis  should  be  able  to  distinguish  a 
dime  from  a  penny  and  a  nickel  from  a  quarter  without  looking. 
Patients should feel the object with only one hand at a time. If they 
are unable to identify it in one hand, it should be placed in the other 
for  comparison.  Individuals  who  are  unable  to  identify  common 
objects and coins in one hand but can do so in the other are said to 
have astereognosis of the abnormal hand. 
QUANTITATIVE SENSORY TESTING
Effective sensory testing devices are commercially available. Quan-
titative  sensory  testing  is  particularly  useful  for  serial  evaluation 
of  cutaneous  sensation  in  clinical  trials.  Threshold  testing  for 
touch and vibratory and thermal sensation is the most widely used 
application. 
ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC STUDIES AND NERVE BIOPSY
Nerve conduction studies and nerve biopsy are important means of 
investigating the peripheral nervous system, but they do not evalu-
ate the function or structure of cutaneous receptors and free nerve 
endings or of unmyelinated or thinly myelinated nerve fibers in the 
nerve trunks. Skin biopsy can be used to evaluate these structures 
in the dermis and epidermis.

 ■ LOCALIZATION OF SENSORY ABNORMALITIES
Sensory symptoms and signs can result from lesions at many different 
levels of the nervous system from the parietal cortex to the peripheral 
sensory  receptor.  Noting  their  distribution  and  nature  is  the  most 
important  way  to  localize  their  source.  Their  extent,  configuration, 
symmetry, quality, and severity are the key observations.

Dysesthesias  without  sensory  findings  by  examination  may  be 
difficult  to  interpret.  To  illustrate,  tingling  dysesthesias  in  an  acral 
distribution  (hands  and  feet)  can  be  systemic  in  origin,  for  example, 
secondary to hyperventilation, or induced by a medication such as ace-
tazolamide. Distal dysesthesias can also be an early event in an evolving 
polyneuropathy  or  may  herald  a  myelopathy,  such  as  from  vitamin 
B12 deficiency. Sometimes, distal dysesthesias have no definable basis. 
In  contrast,  dysesthesias  that  correspond  in  distribution  to  that  of  a 
particular  peripheral  nerve  structure  denote  a  lesion  at  that  site.  For 
instance, dysesthesias restricted to the fifth digit and the adjacent one-
half of the fourth finger on one hand reliably point to disorder of the 
ulnar nerve, most commonly at the elbow.

Nerve  and  Root 
In  focal  nerve  trunk  lesions,  sensory  abnor-
malities  are  readily  mapped  and  generally  have  discrete  boundaries  

(Figs. 25-2 and 25-3). Root (“radicular”) lesions frequently are accom-
panied by deep, aching pain along the course of the related nerve trunk. 
With  compression  of  a  fifth  lumbar  (L5)  or  first  sacral  (S1)  root,  as 
from a ruptured intervertebral disk, sciatica (radicular pain relating to 
the sciatic nerve trunk) is a common manifestation (Chap. 17). With a 
lesion affecting a single root, sensory deficits may be minimal or absent 
because adjacent root territories overlap extensively.

Isolated mononeuropathies may cause symptoms beyond the terri-
tory supplied by the affected nerve, but abnormalities on examination 
typically  are  confined  to  expected  anatomic  boundaries.  In  multiple 
mononeuropathies,  symptoms  and  signs  occur  in  discrete  territories 
supplied  by  different  individual  nerves  and—as  more  nerves  are 
affected—may simulate a polyneuropathy if deficits become confluent. 
With  polyneuropathies,  sensory  deficits  are  generally  graded,  distal, 
and  symmetric  in  distribution  (Chap.  446).  Dysesthesias,  followed 
by  numbness,  begin  in  the  toes  and  ascend  symmetrically.  When 
dysesthesias  reach  the  knees,  they  usually  also  have  appeared  in  the 
fingertips.  The  process  is  nerve  length–dependent,  and  the  deficit  is 
often described as “stocking glove” in type. Involvement of both hands 
and  feet  also  occurs  with  lesions  of  the  upper  cervical  cord  or  the 
brainstem, but an upper level of the sensory disturbance may then be 
found on the trunk and other evidence of a central lesion may be pres-
ent, such as sphincter involvement or signs of an upper motor neuron 
lesion  (Chap.  24).  Although  most  polyneuropathies  are  pansensory 
and  affect  all  modalities  of  sensation,  selective  sensory  dysfunction 
according to nerve fiber size may occur. Small-fiber polyneuropathies 
are  characterized  by  burning,  painful  dysesthesias  with  reduced  pin-
prick and thermal sensation but with sparing of proprioception, motor 
function, and deep tendon reflexes. Touch is involved variably; when 
it is spared, the sensory pattern is referred to as exhibiting sensory dis-
sociation. Sensory dissociation may occur also with spinal cord lesions 
(Chap. 442). Large-fiber polyneuropathies are characterized by vibra-
tion  and  position  sense  deficits,  imbalance,  absent  tendon  reflexes, 
and  variable  motor  dysfunction  but  preservation  of  most  cutaneous 
sensation. Dysesthesias, if present at all, tend to be tingling or bandlike 
in quality.

Sensory  neuronopathy  (or  ganglionopathy)  is  characterized  by 
widespread  but  asymmetric  sensory  loss  occurring  in  a  non-length- 
dependent manner so that it may occur proximally or distally, and in 
the arms, legs, or both. Pain and numbness progress to sensory ataxia 
and  impairment  of  all  sensory  modalities  over  time.  This  condition 
is usually paraneoplastic or idiopathic in origin (Chaps. 94 and 445) 
or related to an autoimmune disease, particularly Sjögren’s syndrome 
(Chap. 361).

Spinal Cord 
(See also Chap. 442) If the spinal cord is transected, 
all sensation is lost below the level of transection. Bladder and bowel 
function also are lost, as is motor function. Lateral hemisection of the 
spinal cord produces the Brown-Séquard syndrome, with absent pain 
and  temperature  sensation  contralaterally  and  loss  of  proprioceptive 
sensation and power ipsilaterally below the lesion (see Figs. 25-1 and 
442-1); ipsilateral pain or hyperesthesia may also occur.

Numbness or paresthesias in both feet may arise from a spinal cord 
lesion; this is especially likely when the upper level of the sensory loss 
extends  to  the  trunk.  When  all  extremities  are  affected,  the  lesion 
is  probably  in  the  cervical  region  or  brainstem  unless  a  peripheral 
neuropathy is responsible. The presence of upper motor neuron signs 
(Chap. 24) supports a central lesion; a hyperesthetic band on the trunk 
may suggest the level of involvement.

A  dissociated  sensory  loss  can  reflect  spinothalamic  tract  involve-
ment  in  the  spinal  cord,  especially  if  the  deficit  is  unilateral  and  has 
an upper level on the torso. Bilateral spinothalamic tract involvement 
occurs with lesions affecting the center of the spinal cord, such as in 
syringomyelia. There is a dissociated sensory loss with impairment of 
pinprick and temperature appreciation but relative preservation of light 
touch, position sense, and vibration appreciation.

Dysfunction of the posterior columns in the spinal cord or of the 
posterior  root  entry  zone  may  lead  to  a  bandlike  sensation  around  
the trunk or a feeling of tight pressure in one or more limbs. Flexion

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesof  the  neck  sometimes  leads  to  an  electric  shock–like  sensation  that 
radiates down the back and into the legs (Lhermitte’s sign) in patients 
with  a  cervical  lesion  affecting  the  posterior  columns,  such  as  from 
multiple sclerosis, cervical spondylosis, or following irradiation to the 
cervical region.

Brainstem  Crossed patterns of sensory disturbance, in which one 
side of the face and the opposite side of the body are affected, localize to 
the lateral medulla. Here a small lesion may damage both the ipsilateral 
descending  trigeminal  tract  and  the  ascending  spinothalamic  fibers 
subserving the opposite arm, leg, and hemitorso (see “Lateral medul-
lary syndrome” in Fig. 426-7). A lesion in the tegmentum of the pons 
and  midbrain,  where  the  lemniscal  and  spinothalamic  tracts  merge, 
causes pansensory loss contralaterally.

Thalamus  Hemisensory disturbance with tingling numbness from 
head to foot is often thalamic in origin but also can arise from the ante-
rior parietal region. If abrupt in onset, the lesion is likely to be due to 
a small stroke (lacunar infarction), particularly if localized to the thal-
amus. Occasionally, with lesions affecting the VPL nucleus or adjacent 
white matter, a syndrome of thalamic pain, also called Déjerine-Roussy 
syndrome, may ensue. The persistent, unrelenting unilateral pain often 
is described in dramatic terms.

Cortex  With lesions of the parietal lobe involving either the cortex 
or  subjacent  white  matter,  the  most  prominent  symptoms  are  con-
tralateral hemineglect, hemi-inattention, and a tendency not to use the 
affected hand and arm. On cortical sensory testing (e.g., two-point dis-
crimination, graphesthesia), abnormalities are often found but primary 
sensation is usually intact. Anterior parietal infarction may present as a 
pseudothalamic syndrome with contralateral loss of primary sensation 
from head to toe. Dysesthesias or a sense of numbness and, rarely, a 
painful state may also occur.

Focal Sensory Seizures  These seizures generally are due to lesions 
in the area of the postcentral or precentral gyrus. The principal symp-
tom of focal sensory seizures is tingling, but additional, more complex 
sensations may occur, such as a rushing feeling, a sense of warmth, or a 
sense of movement without detectable motion. Symptoms typically are 
unilateral; commonly begin in the arm or hand, face, or foot; and often 
spread in a manner that reflects the cortical representation of different 
bodily parts, as in a Jacksonian march. Their duration is variable; sei-
zures may be transient, lasting only for seconds, or persist for an hour 
or more. Focal motor features may supervene, often becoming general-
ized with loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic jerking.

Psychogenic Symptoms  Sensory symptoms may have a psycho-
genic basis. Such symptoms may be generalized or have an anatomic 
boundary  that  is  difficult  to  explain  neurologically,  for  example,  cir-
cumferentially at the groin or shoulder or around a specific joint. Pain 
is common, but the nature and intensity of any sensory disturbances 
are variable. The diagnosis should not be one of exclusion but based on 
suggestive findings that are otherwise difficult to explain, such as mid-
line splitting of impaired vibration, pinprick, or light touch apprecia-
tion; variability or poor reproducibility of sensory deficits; or normal 
performance of tasks requiring sensory input that is seemingly abnor-
mal on formal testing, such as good performance with eyes closed of 
the finger-to-nose test despite an apparent loss of position sense in the 
upper limb. The side with abnormal sensation may be confused when 
the  limbs  are  placed  in  an  unusual  position,  such  as  crossed  behind 
the back. Sensory complaints should not be regarded as psychogenic 
simply because they are unusual.
 ■ TREATMENT
Management is based on treatment of the underlying condition. Symp-
tomatic treatment of acute and chronic pain is discussed in Chap. 13. 
Dysesthesias, when severe and persistent, may respond to anticonvul-
sants (carbamazepine, 100–1000 mg/d; gabapentin, 300–3600 mg/d; or 
pregabalin, 50–300 mg/d), antidepressants (amitriptyline, 25–150 mg/d; 
nortriptyline, 25–150 mg/d; desipramine, 100–300 mg/d; or venlafaxine, 
75–225 mg/d).

26 Gait Disorders,  

Imbalance, and Falls
Jessica M. Baker

PREVALENCE, MORBIDITY,  
AND MORTALITY
Gait and balance problems are common in the elderly and contribute 
to  the  risk  of  falls  and  injury.  Gait  disorders  have  been  described  in 
15%  of  individuals  aged  >65.  By  age  80,  one  person  in  four  will  use 
a  mechanical  aid  to  assist  with  ambulation.  Among  those  aged  ≥85, 
the prevalence of gait abnormality approaches 40%. In epidemiologic 
studies, gait disorders are consistently identified as a major risk factor 
for falls and injury.

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
An upright bipedal gait depends on the successful integration of pos-
tural control and locomotion. These functions are widely distributed in 
the central nervous system. The biomechanics of bipedal walking are 
complex, and the performance is easily compromised by a neurologic 
deficit  at  any  level.  Command  and  control  centers  in  the  brainstem, 
cerebellum,  and  forebrain  modify  the  action  of  spinal  pattern  gener-
ators  to  promote  stepping.  While  a  form  of  “fictive  locomotion”  can 
be  elicited  from  quadrupedal  animals  after  spinal  transection,  this 
capacity is limited in primates. Step generation in primates is depen-
dent on locomotor centers in the pontine tegmentum, midbrain, and 
subthalamic  region.  Locomotor  synergies  are  executed  through  the 
reticular  formation  and  descending  pathways  in  the  ventromedial 
spinal cord. Cerebral control provides a goal and purpose for walking 
and is involved in avoidance of obstacles and adaptation of locomotor 
programs to context and terrain.

Postural  control  requires  the  maintenance  of  the  center  of  mass 
over the base of support through the gait cycle. Unconscious postural 
adjustments  maintain  standing  balance:  long  latency  responses  are 
measurable in the leg muscles, beginning 110 milliseconds after a per-
turbation. Forward motion of the center of mass provides propulsive 
force for stepping, but failure to maintain the center of mass within sta-
bility limits results in falls. The anatomic substrate for dynamic balance 
has not been well defined, but the vestibular nucleus and midline cere-
bellum contribute to balance control in animals. Patients with damage 
to these structures have impaired balance while standing and walking.
Standing  balance  depends  on  good-quality  sensory  information 
about  the  position  of  the  body  center  with  respect  to  the  environ-
ment,  support  surface,  and  gravitational  forces.  Sensory  information 
for  postural  control  is  primarily  generated  by  the  visual  system,  the 
vestibular system, and proprioceptive receptors in the muscle spindles 
and  joints.  A  healthy  redundancy  of  sensory  afferent  information  is 
generally available, but loss of two of the three pathways is sufficient to 
compromise standing balance. Balance disorders in older individuals

sometimes result from multiple insults in the peripheral sensory sys-
tems  (e.g.,  visual  loss,  vestibular  deficit,  peripheral  neuropathy)  that 
critically  degrade  the  quality  of  afferent  information  needed  for  bal-
ance stability.

Older patients with cognitive impairment appear to be particularly 
prone to falls and injury. There is a growing body of literature on the 
use  of  attentional  resources  to  manage  gait  and  balance.  Walking  is 
generally considered to be unconscious and automatic, but the ability 
to walk while attending to a cognitive task (dual-task walking) may be 
compromised  in  the  elderly.  Older  patients  with  deficits  in  executive 
function  may  have  particular  difficulty  in  managing  the  attentional 
resources needed for dynamic balance when distracted.

DISORDERS OF GAIT
Disorders of gait may be attributed to neurologic and nonneurologic 
causes,  although  significant  overlap  often  exists.  The  antalgic  gait 
results from avoidance of pain associated with weight bearing and is 
commonly seen in osteoarthritis. Asymmetry is a common feature of 
gait  disorders  due  to  contractures  and  other  orthopedic  deformities. 
Impaired vision rounds out the list of common nonneurologic causes 
of gait disorders.

Neurologic  gait  disorders  are  disabling  and  equally  important  to 
address. The heterogeneity of gait disorders observed in clinical prac-
tice reflects the large network of neural systems involved in the task. 
Walking is vulnerable to neurologic disease at every level. Gait disor-
ders have been classified descriptively on the basis of abnormal physi-
ology and biomechanics. One problem with this approach is that many 
failing gaits look fundamentally similar. This overlap reflects common 
patterns  of  adaptation  to  threatened  balance  stability  and  declining 
performance.  The  gait  disorder  observed  clinically  must  be  viewed  as 
the product of a neurologic deficit and a functional adaptation. Unique 
features  of  the  failing  gait  are  often  overwhelmed  by  the  adaptive 
response.  Some  common  patterns  of  abnormal  gait  are  summarized 
next. Gait disorders can also be classified by etiology (Table 26-1).
 ■ CAUTIOUS GAIT
The term cautious gait is used to describe the patient who walks with 
an  abbreviated  stride,  widened  base,  and  lowered  center  of  mass,  as 
if  walking  on  a  slippery  surface.  Arms  are  often  held  abducted.  This 
disorder is both common and nonspecific. It is, in essence, an adapta-
tion to a perceived postural threat. There may be an associated fear of 
falling. This disorder can be observed in more than one-third of older 

patients with gait impairment. Physical therapy often improves walking 
to  the  degree  that  follow-up  observation  may  reveal  a  more  specific 
underlying disorder.
 ■ STIFF-LEGGED GAIT
Spastic  gait  is  characterized  by  stiffness  in  the  legs,  an  imbalance  of 
muscle  tone,  and  a  tendency  to  circumduct  and  scuff  the  feet.  The 
disorder  reflects  compromise  of  corticospinal  command  and  overac-
tivity of spinal reflexes. The patient may walk on the toes. In extreme 
instances,  the  legs  cross  due  to  increased  tone  in  the  adductors  
(“scissoring” gait). Upper motor neuron signs are present on physical 
examination. The disorder may be cerebral or spinal in origin.

Myelopathy from cervical spondylosis is a common cause of spastic 
or spastic-ataxic gait in the elderly. Demyelinating disease and trauma 
are  the  leading  causes  of  myelopathy  in  younger  patients.  In  chronic 
progressive myelopathy of unknown cause, a workup with laboratory 
and imaging tests may establish a diagnosis. A structural lesion, such 
as a tumor or a spinal vascular malformation, should be excluded with 
appropriate testing. Spinal cord disorders are discussed in detail in 
Chap. 442.

With cerebral spasticity, asymmetry is common, the upper extrem-
ities are usually involved, and dysarthria is often an associated feature. 
Common  causes  include  vascular  disease  (stroke),  multiple  sclerosis, 
motor  neuron  disease,  and  perinatal  nervous  system  injury  (cerebral 
palsy).

Other stiff-legged gaits include dystonia (Chap. 436) and stiff-person 
syndrome  (Chap.  94).  Dystonia  is  a  disorder  characterized  by  sus-
tained muscle contractions resulting in repetitive twisting movements 
and abnormal posture. It often has a genetic basis. Dystonic spasms can 
produce plantar flexion and inversion of the feet, sometimes with tor-
sion of the trunk. In autoimmune stiff-person syndrome, exaggerated 
lordosis of the lumbar spine and overactivation of antagonist muscles 
restrict  trunk  and  lower-limb  movement  and  result  in  a  wooden  or 
fixed posture.

 ■ PARKINSONISM, FREEZING GAIT, AND OTHER 
MOVEMENT DISORDERSS
Parkinson’s  disease  (Chap.  435)  is  common,  affecting  1%  of  the 
population >65 years of age. The stooped posture, shuffling gait, and 
decreased arm swing are characteristic and distinctive features. Patients 
sometimes  accelerate  (festinate)  with  walking,  display  retropulsion, 
or  exhibit  a  tendency  to  turn  en  bloc.  The  step-to-step  variability

of  the  parkinsonian  gait  also  contributes  to  falls,  which  are  a  major 
source of morbidity, particularly later in the disease course. Dopamine 
replacement improves step length, arm swing, turning speed, and gait 
initiation.  There  is  increasing  evidence  that  deficits  in  cholinergic 
circuits in the pedunculopontine nucleus and cortex contribute to the 
gait disorder of Parkinson’s disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as 
donepezil  and  rivastigmine  have  been  shown  in  early  studies  to  sig-
nificantly decrease gait variability, instability, and fall frequency, even 
in the absence of cognitive impairment, perhaps through improvement 
in attention.

Freezing is defined as a brief, episodic absence of forward progres-
sion of the feet, despite the intention to walk. Freezing may be triggered 
by  approaching  a  narrow  doorway  or  crowd,  may  be  overcome  by 
visual  cueing,  and  contributes  to  fall  risk.  Gait  freezing  is  present  in 
approximately  one-quarter  of  Parkinson’s  patients  within  5  years  of 
onset, and its frequency increases further over time. In treated patients, 
end-of-dose gait freezing is a common problem that may improve with 
more  frequent  administration  of  dopaminergic  drugs  or  with  use  of 
monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors such as rasagiline or selegiline 
(Chap. 435).

Freezing of gait is also common in other neurodegenerative disor-
ders associated with parkinsonism, including progressive supranuclear 
palsy  (PSP),  multiple-system  atrophy,  and  corticobasal  degeneration. 
Patients  with  these  disorders  frequently  present  with  axial  stiffness, 
postural  instability,  and  a  shuffling,  freezing  gait  while  lacking  the 
characteristic pill-rolling tremor of Parkinson’s disease. The gait of PSP 
is  typically  more  erect  compared  with  the  stooped  posture  of  typical 
Parkinson’s disease, and falls within the first year also suggest the possi-
bility of PSP. The gait of vascular parkinsonism tends to be broad-based 
and  shuffling  with  reduced  arm  swing  bilaterally;  disproportionate 
involvement of gait early in the disease course differentiates this entity 
from Parkinson’s disease.

Hyperkinetic  movement  disorders  also  produce  characteristic  and 
recognizable disturbances in gait. In Huntington’s disease (Chap. 436), 
the  unpredictable  occurrence  of  choreic  movements  gives  the  gait  a 
dancing quality. Tardive dyskinesia is the cause of many odd, stereo-
typic gait disorders seen in patients chronically exposed to antipsychot-
ics and other drugs that block the D2 dopamine receptor. Orthostatic 
tremor  is  a  high-frequency,  low-amplitude  tremor  predominantly 
involving  the  lower  extremities.  Patients  often  report  shakiness  or 
unsteadiness  on  standing  and  improvement  with  sitting  or  walking. 
Falls are common. The tremor is often only appreciable by palpating 
the legs while standing.
 ■ FRONTAL GAIT DISORDER
Frontal gait disorder, also known as higher-level gait disorder, is com-
mon  in  the  elderly  and  has  a  variety  of  causes.  The  term  is  used  to 
describe  a  shuffling,  freezing  gait  with  imbalance,  and  other  signs  of 
higher cerebral dysfunction. Typical features include a wide base of sup-
port, a short stride, shuffling along the floor, and difficulty with starts 
and turns. Many patients exhibit a difficulty with gait initiation that is 
descriptively characterized as the “slipping clutch” syndrome or gait igni-
tion failure. The term lower-body parkinsonism is also used to describe 
such patients. Strength is generally preserved, and patients are able to 

make  stepping  movements  when  not  standing  and  maintaining  their 
balance at the same time. This disorder is best considered a higher-level 
motor control disorder, as opposed to an apraxia (Chap. 30), though 
the term gait apraxia persists in the literature.

The most common cause of frontal gait disorder is vascular disease, 
particularly  subcortical  small-vessel  disease  in  the  deep  frontal  white 
matter and centrum ovale. Over three-quarters of patients with subcor-
tical vascular dementia demonstrate gait abnormalities; decreased arm 
swing and a stooped posture are particularly prevalent features. The clin-
ical syndrome also includes dysarthria, pseudobulbar affect (emotional 
disinhibition), increased tone, and hyperreflexia in the lower limbs.

Normal pressure (communicating) hydrocephalus (NPH) in adults 
also presents with a similar gait disorder (Chap. 431). Other features 
of the diagnostic triad (mental changes, incontinence) may be absent 
in  a  substantial  number  of  patients.  MRI  demonstrates  ventricular 
enlargement, an enlarged flow void about the aqueduct, periventricular 
white  matter  change,  and  high-convexity  tightness  (disproportionate 
widening  of  the  sylvian  fissures  versus  the  cortical  sulci).  A  lumbar 
puncture or dynamic test is necessary to confirm a diagnosis of NPH. 
Neurodegenerative  dementias  and  mass  lesions  of  the  frontal  lobes 
cause a similar clinical picture and can be differentiated from vascular 
disease and hydrocephalus by neuroimaging.

 ■ CEREBELLAR GAIT ATAXIA
Disorders  of  the  cerebellum  (Chap.  439)  have  a  dramatic  impact  on 
gait and balance. Cerebellar gait ataxia is characterized by a wide base 
of support, lateral instability of the trunk, erratic foot placement, and 
decompensation of balance when attempting to walk on a narrow base. 
Difficulty maintaining balance when turning is often an early feature. 
Patients are unable to walk tandem heel to toe and display truncal sway 
in narrow-based or tandem stance. They show considerable variation 
in their tendency to fall in daily life.

Causes of cerebellar ataxia in older patients include stroke, trauma, 
tumor, and neurodegenerative disease such as multiple-system atrophy 
(Chap. 440)  and  various  forms  of  hereditary  cerebellar  degeneration 
(Chap.  439).  A  short  expansion  at  the  site  of  the  fragile  X  mutation 
(fragile  X  premutation)  has  been  associated  with  gait  ataxia  in  older 
men. Alcohol causes an acute and chronic cerebellar ataxia. In patients 
with  ataxia  due  to  cerebellar  degeneration,  MRI  demonstrates  the 
extent and topography of cerebellar atrophy.

 ■ SENSORY ATAXIA
As  reviewed  earlier  in  this  chapter,  balance  depends  on  high-quality 
afferent  information  from  the  visual  and  the  vestibular  systems  and 
proprioception.  When  this  information  is  lost  or  degraded,  balance 
during  locomotion  is  impaired  and  instability  results.  The  sensory 
ataxia of tabetic neurosyphilis is a classic example. The contemporary 
equivalent is the patient with neuropathy affecting large fibers. Vitamin 
B12 deficiency is a treatable cause of large-fiber sensory loss in the spinal 
cord and peripheral nervous system. Joint position and vibration sense 
are diminished in the lower limbs. The stance in such patients is desta-
bilized by eye closure; they often look down at their feet when walking 
and  do  poorly  in  the  dark.  Table 26-2  compares  sensory  ataxia  with 
cerebellar ataxia and frontal gait disorder.

 ■ NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE
Patients  with  neuromuscular  disease  often  have  an  abnormal  gait, 
occasionally as a presenting feature. With distal weakness (peripheral 
neuropathy), the step height is increased to compensate for foot drop, 
and the sole of the foot may slap on the floor during weight acceptance, 
termed the steppage gait. Patients with myopathy or muscular dystro-
phy more typically exhibit proximal weakness. Weakness of the hip gir-
dle may result in some degree of excess pelvic sway during locomotion. 
The stooped posture of lumbar spinal stenosis ameliorates pain from 
the  compression  of  the  cauda  equina  occurring  with  a  more  upright 
posture while walking and may mimic early parkinsonism.
 ■ TOXIC AND METABOLIC DISORDERS
Chronic  toxicity  from  medications  and  metabolic  disturbances  can 
impair motor function and gait. Examination may reveal mental status 
changes,  asterixis,  or  myoclonus.  Static  equilibrium  is  disturbed,  and 
such patients are easily thrown off balance. Disequilibrium is partic-
ularly  evident  in  patients  with  chronic  renal  disease  and  those  with 
hepatic  failure,  in  whom  asterixis  may  impair  postural  support.  Sed-
ative  drugs,  especially  neuroleptics  and  long-acting  benzodiazepines, 
affect postural control and increase the risk for falls. These disorders 
are especially important to recognize because they are often treatable.
 ■ FUNCTIONAL GAIT DISORDER
Functional neurologic disorders (formerly “psychogenic”) are common 
in  practice,  and  the  presentation  often  involves  gait.  Sudden  onset, 
inconsistent  deficits,  waxing  and  waning  course,  incongruence  of 
symptoms with an organic lesion, and improvement with distraction 
are  key  features.  Phenomenology  is  variable;  extreme  slow  motion, 
an  inappropriately  overcautious  gait,  odd  gyrations  of  posture  with 
wastage  of  muscular  energy,  astasia–abasia  (inability  to  stand  and 
walk),  bouncing,  and  foot  stiffness  (dystonia)  have  been  described. 
Falls are rare, and there are often discrepancies between examination 
findings and the patient’s functional status. Preceding stress or trauma 
is variably present, and its absence does not preclude the diagnosis of a 
functional gait disorder. Functional gait disorders may be challenging 
to diagnose and should be differentiated from the slowness and psy-
chomotor retardation seen in certain patients with major depression.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Slowly Progressive Disorder of Gait

When reviewing the history, it is helpful to inquire about the onset 
and progression of disability. Initial awareness of an unsteady gait 
often follows a fall. Stepwise evolution or sudden progression sug-
gests vascular disease. Gait disorder may be associated with urinary 
urgency  and  incontinence,  particularly  in  patients  with  cervical 
spine disease or hydrocephalus. It is always important to review the 
use of alcohol and medications that affect gait and balance. Infor-
mation  on  localization  derived  from  the  neurologic  examination 
can be helpful in narrowing the list of possible diagnoses.

Gait observation provides an immediate sense of the patient’s degree 
of disability. Arthritic and antalgic gaits are recognized by observation, 
although neurologic and orthopedic problems may coexist. Character-
istic patterns of abnormality are sometimes seen, although, as stated 
previously,  failing  gaits  often  look  fundamentally  similar.  Cadence 
(steps  per  minute),  velocity,  and  stride  length  can  be  recorded  by 
timing a patient over a fixed distance. Watching the patient rise from a 
chair provides a good functional assessment of balance.

Brain  imaging  studies  may  be  informative  in  patients  with  an 
undiagnosed disorder of gait. MRI is sensitive for cerebral lesions 
of  vascular  or  demyelinating  disease  and  is  a  good  screening  test 
for occult hydrocephalus. Patients with recurrent falls are at risk for 
subdural  hematoma.  As  mentioned  earlier,  many  elderly  patients 
with  gait  and  balance  difficulty  have  white  matter  abnormalities 
in the periventricular region and centrum semiovale. While these 
lesions may be an incidental finding, a substantial burden of white 
matter disease will ultimately impact cerebral control of locomotion.

DISORDERS OF BALANCE
 ■ DEFINITION, ETIOLOGY, AND MANIFESTATIONS
Balance  is  the  ability  to  maintain  equilibrium—a  dynamic  state  in 
which  one’s  center  of  mass  is  controlled  with  respect  to  the  lower 
extremities, gravity, and the support surface despite external perturba-
tions. The reflexes required to maintain upright posture require input 
from cerebellar, vestibular, and somatosensory systems; the premotor 
cortex  and  corticospinal  and  reticulospinal  tracts  mediate  output  to 
axial and proximal limb muscles. These responses are physiologically 
complex,  and  the  anatomic  representation  they  entail  is  not  well 
understood.  Failure  can  occur  at  any  level  and  presents  as  difficulty 
maintaining posture while standing and walking.

The history and physical examination may differentiate underlying 
causes  of  imbalance.  Patients  with  cerebellar  ataxia  do  not  generally 
complain of dizziness, although balance is visibly impaired. Neurologic 
examination  reveals  a  variety  of  cerebellar  signs.  Postural  compen-
sation may prevent falls early on, but falls are inevitable with disease 
progression. The progression of neurodegenerative ataxia is often mea-
sured by the number of years to loss of stable ambulation.

Vestibular  disorders  (Chap.  22)  have  symptoms  and  signs  that 
fall  into  three  categories:  (1)  vertigo  (the  subjective  inappropriate 
perception or illusion of movement); (2) nystagmus (involuntary eye 
movements); and (3) impaired standing balance. Not every patient has 
all manifestations. Patients with vestibular deficits related to ototoxic 
drugs  may  lack  vertigo  or  obvious  nystagmus,  but  their  balance  is 
impaired  on  standing  and  walking,  and  they  cannot  navigate  in  the 
dark. Laboratory testing is available to investigate vestibular deficits.

Somatosensory  deficits  also  produce  imbalance  and  falls.  There  is 
often a subjective sense of insecure balance and fear of falling. Postural 
control is compromised by eye closure (Romberg’s sign); these patients 
also have difficulty navigating in the dark. A dramatic example is pro-
vided by the patient with autoimmune subacute sensory neuropathy, 
which  is  sometimes  a  paraneoplastic  disorder  (Chap.  94).  Compen-
satory strategies enable such patients to walk in the virtual absence of 
proprioception, but the task requires active visual monitoring.

Patients  with  higher-level  disorders  of  equilibrium  have  difficulty 
maintaining  balance  in  daily  life  and  may  present  with  falls.  Their 
awareness  of  balance  impairment  may  be  reduced.  Patients  taking 
sedating medications are in this category.

 ■ FALLS
Falls are common in the elderly; over one-third of people aged >65 who 
are living in the community fall each year. This number is even higher 
in nursing homes and hospitals. Elderly people are not only at higher 
risk for falls but are also more likely to suffer serious complications due 
to medical comorbidities such as osteoporosis. Hip fractures result in 
hospitalization,  can  lead  to  nursing  home  admission,  and  are  associ-
ated with an increased mortality risk in the subsequent year. Falls may 
result in brain or spinal injury, the history of which may be difficult 
for the patient to provide. The proportion of spinal cord injuries due 
to falls in individuals aged >65 years has doubled in the past decade, 
perhaps due to increasing activity in this age group. Some falls result in 
a prolonged time lying on the ground; fractures and CNS injury are a 
particular concern in this context.

For each person who is physically disabled, there are others whose 
functional  independence  is  limited  by  anxiety  and  fear  of  falling. 
Nearly  one  in  five  elderly  individuals  voluntarily  restricts  his  or  her 
activity because of fear of falling. With loss of ambulation, the quality 
of life diminishes, and rates of morbidity and mortality increase.

 ■ RISK FACTORS FOR FALLS
Risk factors for falls may be intrinsic (e.g., gait and balance disorders) 
or extrinsic (e.g., polypharmacy, environmental factors); some risk fac-
tors are modifiable. The presence of multiple risk factors is associated 
with  a  substantially  increased  risk  of  falls.  Table  26-3  summarizes  a 
meta-analysis of studies establishing the principal risk factors for falls. 
Polypharmacy (use of four or more prescription medications) has also 
been identified as an important risk factor.

 ■ ASSESSMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH FALLS
The  most  productive  approach  is  to  identify  the  high-risk  patient 
prospectively, before there is a serious injury. All community-dwelling 
adults  should  be  asked  annually  about  falls  and  whether  or  not  fear 
of  falling  limits  daily  activities.  The  Timed  Up  and  Go  (“TUG”)  test 
involves timing a patient as they stand up from a chair, walk 10 feet, 
turn, and then sit down. Patients with a history of falls or those requir-
ing >12 s to complete the TUG test are at high risk for falls and should 
undergo further assessment.

History  The  history  surrounding  a  fall  is  often  problematic  or 
incomplete, and the underlying mechanism or cause may be difficult to 
establish in retrospect. Patients should be queried about any provoking 
factors (including head turn, standing) or prodromal symptoms, such 
as dizziness, vertigo, presyncopal symptoms, or focal weakness. A his-
tory of baseline mobility and medical comorbidities should be elicited. 
Patients at particular risk include those with mental status changes or 
dementia.  Medications  should  be  reviewed,  with  particular  attention 
to benzodiazepines, opioids, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, antidepres-
sants, antiarrhythmics, and diuretics, all of which are associated with 
an increased risk of falls. It is equally important to distinguish mechan-
ical falls (those caused by tripping or slipping) due to purely extrinsic 
or  environmental  factors  from  those  in  which  a  modifiable  intrinsic 
factor  contributes.  Recurrent  falls  may  indicate  an  underlying  gait  or 
balance disorder. Falls associated with loss of consciousness (syncope, 
seizure) may require appropriate cardiac or neurologic evaluation and 
intervention (Chaps. 21 and 425), although a patient’s report of change 
in consciousness may be unreliable.

Physical  Examination  Examination  of  the  patient  with  falls 
should  include  a  basic  cardiac  examination,  including  orthostatic 
blood pressure if indicated by history, and observation of any ortho-
pedic  abnormalities.  Mental  status  is  easily  assessed  while  obtaining 
a history from the patient; the remainder of the neurologic examina-
tion should include visual acuity, strength and sensation in the lower 
extremities, muscle tone, and cerebellar function, with particular atten-
tion to gait and balance as described earlier in this chapter.

Fall Patterns  The  description  of  a  fall  event  may  provide  further 
clues to the underlying etiology. While there is no standard nosology 
of falls, some common clinical patterns may emerge and provide a clue.
DROP ATTACKS AND COLLAPSING FALLS  Drop attacks and collapsing 
falls are associated with a sudden loss of postural tone. Patients may 
report  that  their  legs  just  “gave  out”  underneath  them  or  that  they 
“collapsed  in  a  heap.”  Syncope  or  orthostatic  hypotension  may  be  a 
factor  in  some  such  falls.  Neurologic  causes  are  relatively  rare  but 
include atonic seizures, myoclonus, and intermittent obstruction of the 
foramen of Monro by a colloid cyst of the third ventricle causing acute 
obstructive  hydrocephalus.  An  emotional  trigger  suggests  cataplexy. 

While  collapsing  falls  are  more  common  among  older  patients  with 
vascular risk factors, drop attacks should not be confused with verte-
brobasilar ischemic attacks.

177

TOPPLING FALLS  Some patients maintain tone in antigravity muscles 
but fall over like a tree trunk, as if postural defenses had disengaged. 
Causes include cerebellar pathology and lesions of the vestibular sys-
tem. There may be a consistent direction to such falls. Toppling falls are 
an early feature of progressive supranuclear palsy, and a late feature of 
Parkinson’s disease, once postural instability has developed. Thalamic 
lesions causing truncal instability (thalamic astasia) may also contrib-
ute to this type of fall.

FALLS DUE TO GAIT FREEZING  Freezing of gait is seen in Parkinson’s 
disease and related disorders. The feet stick to the floor and the center 
of  mass  keeps  moving,  resulting  in  a  disequilibrium  from  which  the 
patient has difficulty recovering, resulting in a forward fall. Similarly, 
patients with Parkinson’s disease and festinating gait may find their feet 
unable to keep up and may thus fall forward.

FALLS RELATED TO SENSORY LOSS  Patients with somatosensory, visual, 
or  vestibular  deficits  are  prone  to  falls.  These  patients  have  particular 
difficulty dealing with poor illumination or walking on uneven ground. 
They often report subjective imbalance, apprehension, and fear of fall-
ing. These patients may be especially responsive to a rehabilitation-based 
intervention.

FALLS RELATED TO WEAKNESS  Patients who lack strength in antigrav-
ity muscles have difficulty rising from a chair or maintaining their bal-
ance after a perturbation. These patients are often unable to get up after 
a fall and may have to remain on the floor for a prolonged period until 
help arrives. If due to deconditioning, this is often treatable. Resistance 
strength training can increase muscle mass and leg strength, even for 
people in their eighties and nineties.

TREATMENT
Interventions to Reduce the Risk of Falls and Injury

Efforts  should  be  made  to  define  the  mechanism  underlying  falls 
in  a  given  patient,  as  specific  treatment  may  be  possible  once  a 
diagnosis  is  established.  Orthostatic  changes  in  blood  pressure 
and  pulse  should  be  recorded.  Medications  (including  over-the-
counter)  should  be  reviewed,  reevaluating  benefits  and  burdens 
of medications that might increase fall risk. Treatment of cataracts 
and avoidance of multifocal lenses could be considered for patients 
whose  falls  result  from  vision  impairment.  A  home  visit  to  look 
for  environmental  hazards  can  be  helpful.  A  variety  of  modifica-
tions may be recommended to improve safety, including improved 
lighting, installation of grab bars and nonslip surfaces, and use of 
adaptive equipment.

Home-  and  group-based  exercise  programs  focusing  on  leg 
strength and balance, physical therapy, and use of assistive devices 
reduce  fall  risk  in  individuals  with  a  history  of  falls  or  disorders 
of  gait  and  balance.  Rehabilitative  interventions  aim  to  improve 
muscle strength and balance stability and to make the patient more 
resistant to injury. High-intensity resistance strength training with 
weights  and  machines  is  useful  to  improve  muscle  mass,  even  in 
frail  older  patients.  Improvements  realized  in  posture  and  gait 
should  translate  to  reduced  risk  of  falls  and  injury.  Sensory  bal-
ance  training  is  another  approach  to  improving  balance  stability. 
Measurable  gains  can  be  made  in  a  few  weeks  of  training,  and 
benefits can be maintained over 6 months by a 10- to 20-min home 
exercise program. This strategy is particularly successful in patients 
with vestibular and somatosensory balance disorders. The National 
Institute on Aging provides online examples of balance exercises for 
older adults. A Tai Chi exercise program has been demonstrated to 
reduce the risk of falls and injury in patients with Parkinson’s dis-
ease. Cognitive training, including dual-task training, may improve 
mobility in older adults with cognitive impairment.

reversible cognitive disturbance. Hyperactive patients are often easily 
recognized  by  their  characteristic  severe  agitation,  tremor,  hallucina-
tions,  and  autonomic  instability.  Patients  who  are  quietly  hypoactive 
are more often overlooked on the medical wards and in the ICU.

The reversibility of delirium is emphasized because many etiologies, 
such  as  infection  and  medication  effects,  can  be  treated  easily.  The 
long-term cognitive consequences of delirium remain an area of active 
research.  Some  episodes  of  delirium  continue  for  weeks,  months,  or 
even years. The persistence of delirium in some patients and its high 
recurrence  rate  may  be  due  to  inadequate  initial  treatment  of  the 
underlying etiology. In other instances, delirium appears to cause per-
manent neuronal damage and long-term cognitive decline. Therefore, 
prevention strategies are important to implement. Even if an episode 
of delirium completely resolves, there may be lingering effects of the 
disorder; a patient’s recall of events after delirium varies widely, ranging 
from complete amnesia to repeated reexperiencing of the frightening 
period of confusion, similar to what is seen in patients with posttrau-
matic stress disorder.

27 Confusion and Delirium

S. Andrew Josephson, Bruce L. Miller

Confusion,  a  mental  and  behavioral  state  of  reduced  comprehen-
sion,  coherence,  and  capacity  to  reason,  is  one  of  the  most  common 
problems encountered in medicine, accounting for a large number of 
emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and inpatient con-
sultations. Delirium, a term used to describe an acute confusional state, 
remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, costing billions of 
dollars yearly in health care costs in the United States alone. Despite 
increased efforts targeting awareness of this condition, delirium often 
goes unrecognized in the face of evidence that it is usually the cognitive 
manifestation of serious underlying medical or neurologic illness.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES OF DELIRIUM
A  multitude  of  terms  are  used  to  describe  patients  with  delirium, 
including  encephalopathy,  acute  brain  failure,  acute  confusional  state, 
and  postoperative  or  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)  psychosis.  Delirium 
has  many  clinical  manifestations,  but  it  is  defined  as  a  relatively 
acute  decline  in  cognition  that  fluctuates  over  hours  or  days.  The 
hallmark  of  delirium  is  a  deficit  of  attention,  although  all  cognitive 
domains—including  memory,  executive  function,  visuospatial  tasks, 
and language—are variably involved. Associated symptoms that may be 
present in some cases include altered sleep-wake cycles, perceptual dis-
turbances such as hallucinations or delusions, affect changes, and auto-
nomic findings that include heart rate and blood pressure instability.

Delirium is a clinical diagnosis that is made only at the bedside. Two 
subtypes have been described—hyperactive and hypoactive—based on 
differential psychomotor features. The cognitive syndrome associated 
with  severe  alcohol  withdrawal  (i.e.,  “delirium  tremens”)  remains 
the  classic  example  of  the  hyperactive  subtype,  featuring  prominent 
hallucinations,  agitation,  and  hyperarousal,  often  accompanied  by 
life-threatening autonomic instability. In striking contrast is the hypo-
active subtype, exemplified by benzodiazepine intoxication, in which 
patients are withdrawn and quiet, with prominent apathy and psycho-
motor slowing.

This dichotomy between subtypes of delirium is a useful construct, 
but  patients  often  fall  somewhere  along  a  spectrum  between  the 
hyperactive and hypoactive extremes, sometimes fluctuating from one 
to the other. Therefore, clinicians must recognize this broad range of 
presentations of delirium to identify all patients with this potentially 

 ■ RISK FACTORS
An  effective  primary  prevention  strategy  for  delirium  begins  with 
identification of high-risk patients. Some hospital systems have initi-
ated comprehensive delirium programs that screen most or all patients 
upon  admission  or  before  elective  surgery;  positive  screens  trigger  a 
host  of  focused  prevention  measures.  Multiple  validated  scoring  sys-
tems have been developed as a screen for asymptomatic patients, many 
of which emphasize well-established risk factors for delirium.

The two most consistently identified risk factors are older age and 
baseline cognitive dysfunction. Individuals who are aged >65 or exhibit 
low  scores  on  standardized  tests  of  cognition  develop  delirium  upon 
hospitalization  at a  rate  approaching  50%. Whether age  and baseline 
cognitive dysfunction are truly independent risk factors is uncertain. 
Other predisposing factors include sensory deprivation, such as preex-
isting hearing and visual impairment, as well as indices for poor overall 
health,  including  baseline  immobility,  malnutrition,  and  underlying 
medical or neurologic illness.

In-hospital risks for delirium include the use of bladder catheteriza-
tion, physical restraints, sleep and sensory deprivation, and the addi-
tion of three or more new medications. Avoiding such risks remains a 
key  component  of  delirium  prevention  as  well  as  treatment.  Surgical 
and anesthetic risk factors for the development of postoperative delir-
ium  include  procedures  such  as  those  involving  cardiopulmonary 
bypass,  inadequate  or  excessive  treatment  of  pain  in  the  immediate 
postoperative period, and perhaps specific agents such as inhalational 
anesthetics.

The relationship between delirium and dementia (Chap. 29) is com-
plicated by significant overlap between the two conditions, and it is not 
always simple to distinguish between them. Dementia and preexisting 
cognitive dysfunction serve as major risk factors for delirium, and at 
least two-thirds of cases of delirium occur in patients with coexisting 
underlying dementia. A form of dementia with parkinsonism, demen-
tia  with  Lewy  bodies  (Chap.  434),  is  characterized  by  a  fluctuating 
course, prominent visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and an atten-
tional  deficit  that  clinically  resembles  hyperactive  delirium;  patients 
with this condition are particularly vulnerable to delirium. Delirium in 
the elderly often reflects an insult to a brain that is vulnerable due to an 
underlying neurodegenerative condition. Therefore, the development 
of delirium sometimes heralds the onset of a previously unrecognized 
brain disorder, and after the acute delirious episode has cleared, careful 
screening for an underlying condition should occur in the outpatient 
setting.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Delirium is common, but its reported incidence has varied widely with 
the criteria used to define this disorder. Estimates of delirium in hospi-
talized patients range from 10% to >50%, with higher rates reported for 
elderly patients and patients undergoing hip surgery. Older patients in 
the ICU have especially high rates of delirium that approach 75%. The

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasescondition is not recognized in up to one-third of delirious inpatients, 
and  the  diagnosis  is  especially  problematic  in  the  ICU  environment, 
where  cognitive  dysfunction  is  often  difficult  to  appreciate  in  the 
setting of serious systemic illness and sedation. Delirium in the ICU 
should be viewed as an important manifestation of organ dysfunction 
not  unlike  liver,  kidney,  or  heart  failure.  Outside  the  acute  hospital 
setting,  delirium  occurs  in  nearly  one-quarter  of  patients  in  nursing 
homes  and  in  50–80%  of  those  at  the  end  of  life.  These  estimates 
emphasize the remarkably high frequency of this cognitive syndrome 
in older patients, a population that continues to grow.

An episode of delirium was previously viewed as a transient condi-
tion that carried a benign prognosis. It is now recognized as a disorder 
with  substantial  morbidity  and  mortality,  and  that  often  represents 
the  first  manifestation  of  a  serious  underlying  illness.  Estimates  of 
in-hospital  mortality  rates  among  delirious  patients  range  from  25% 
to  33%,  similar  to  mortality  rates  due  to  sepsis.  Patients  with  an  in- 
hospital  episode  of  delirium  have  a  fivefold  higher  mortality  rate  in 
the months after their illness compared with age matched nondelirious 
hospitalized patients. Delirious hospitalized patients also have a longer 
length of stay, are more likely to be discharged to a nursing home, have 
a higher frequency of readmission, and are more likely to experience 
subsequent episodes of delirium and cognitive decline; as a result, this 
condition has an enormous economic cost.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS
The  pathogenesis  and  anatomy  of  delirium  are  incompletely  under-
stood.  The  attentional  deficit  that  serves  as  the  neuropsychological 
hallmark  of  delirium  has  a  diffuse  localization  within  the  brainstem, 
thalamus,  prefrontal  cortex,  and  parietal  lobes.  Rarely,  focal  lesions 
such  as  ischemic  strokes  have  led  to  delirium  in  otherwise  healthy 
persons;  right  parietal  and  medial  dorsal  thalamic  lesions  have  been 
reported most commonly, pointing to the importance of these areas in 
delirium pathogenesis. In most cases, however, delirium results from 
widespread  disturbances  in  cortical  and  subcortical  regions  of  the 
brain.  Electroencephalogram  (EEG)  usually  reveals  symmetric  slow-
ing, a nonspecific finding that supports diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Multiple neurotransmitter abnormalities, proinflammatory factors, 
and  specific  genes  likely  play  a  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  delirium. 
Deficiency  of  acetylcholine  may  play  a  key  role,  and  medications 
with  anticholinergic  properties  can  commonly  precipitate  delirium. 
As  noted  earlier,  patients  with  preexisting  dementia  are  particularly 
susceptible to episodes of delirium. Alzheimer’s disease (Chap. 431), 
dementia  with  Lewy  bodies  (Chap.  434),  and  Parkinson’s  disease 
dementia  (Chap.  435)  are  all  associated  with  cholinergic  deficiency 
due  to  degeneration  of  acetylcholine-producing  neurons  in  the  basal 
forebrain.  In  addition,  other  neurotransmitters  are  also  likely  to  be 
involved  in  this  diffuse  cerebral  disorder.  For  example,  increases  in 
dopamine can lead to delirium, and patients with Parkinson’s disease 
treated  with  dopaminergic  medications  can  develop  a  delirium-like 
state that features visual hallucinations, fluctuations, and confusion.

Not all individuals exposed to the same insult will develop signs of 
delirium.  A  low  dose  of  an  anticholinergic  medication  may  have  no 
cognitive effects on a healthy young adult but produce a florid delir-
ium in an elderly person with known underlying dementia, although 
even  healthy  young  persons  develop  delirium  with  very  high  doses 
of  anticholinergic  medications.  This  concept  of  delirium  developing 
as  the  result  of  an  insult  in  predisposed  individuals  is  currently  the 
most widely accepted pathogenic construct. Therefore, if a previously 
healthy individual with no known history of cognitive illness develops 
delirium  in  the  setting  of  a  relatively  minor  insult  such  as  elective 
surgery  or  hospitalization,  an  unrecognized  underlying  neurologic 
illness such as a neurodegenerative disease, multiple previous strokes, 
or another diffuse cerebral cause should be considered. In this context, 
delirium can be viewed as a “stress test for the brain” whereby exposure 
to  known  inciting  factors  such  as  systemic  infection  and  offending 
drugs  can  unmask  a  decreased  cerebral  reserve  and  herald  a  serious 
underlying and potentially treatable illness. New blood-based biomark-
ers for specific dementias may soon be available to help predict people 
at risk for delirium before surgical procedures or hospitalization.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Delirium

Because  the  diagnosis  of  delirium  is  clinical  and  is  made  at  the 
bedside, a careful history and physical examination are necessary in 
evaluating patients with possible confusional states. Screening tools 
can aid physicians and nurses in identifying patients with delirium, 
including the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM); the Nursing 
Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC); the Organic Brain Syndrome 
Scale; the Delirium Rating Scale; and, in the ICU, the ICU version 
of  the  CAM  and  the  Delirium  Detection  Score.  Using  the  well- 
validated CAM, a diagnosis of delirium is made if there is (1) an 
acute  onset  and  fluctuating  course  and  (2)  inattention  accompa-
nied by either (3) disorganized thinking or (4) an altered level of 
consciousness (Table 27-1). These scales may not identify the full 
spectrum of patients with delirium, and all patients who are acutely 
confused should be presumed delirious regardless of their presen-
tation due to the wide variety of possible clinical features. A course 
that fluctuates over hours or days and may worsen at night (termed 
sundowning) is typical but not essential for the diagnosis. Observa-
tion will usually reveal an altered level of consciousness or a deficit 
of  attention.  Other  features  that  are  sometimes  present  include 
alteration of sleep-wake cycles, thought disturbances such as hallu-
cinations or delusions, autonomic instability, and changes in affect. 
HISTORY
It may be difficult to elicit an accurate history in delirious patients 
who  have  altered  levels  of  consciousness  or  impaired  attention. 
Information  from  a  collateral  source  such  as  a  spouse  or  another 
family  member  is  therefore  invaluable.  The  three  most  important 
pieces  of  history  are  the  patient’s  baseline  cognitive  function,  the 
time course of the present illness, and current medications.

Premorbid cognitive function can be assessed through the col-
lateral  source  or,  if  needed,  via  a  review  of  outpatient  records. 
Delirium by definition represents a change that is relatively acute 
and usually developing over hours to days, from a cognitive base-
line.  An  acute  confusional  state  is  nearly  impossible  to  diagnose 
without  some  knowledge  of  baseline  cognitive  function.  Without 

TABLE 27-1  The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) Diagnostic 
Algorithma
The diagnosis of delirium requires the presence of features 1 and 2 and either 
feature 3 or 4.

Feature 1. Acute Onset and Fluctuating Course

This feature is satisfied by positive responses to the following questions: Is there 
evidence of an acute change in mental status from the patient’s baseline? Did 
the (abnormal) behavior fluctuate during the day, that is, tend to come and go, or 
did it increase and decrease in severity?

Feature 2. Inattention

This feature is satisfied by a positive response to the following question: Did the 
patient have difficulty focusing attention, for example, being easily distractible, 
or have difficulty keeping track of what was being said?

Feature 3. Disorganized Thinking

This feature is satisfied by a positive response to the following question: Was 
the patient’s thinking disorganized or incoherent, such as rambling or irrelevant 
conversation, unclear or illogical flow of ideas, or unpredictable switching from 
subject to subject?

Feature 4. Altered Level of Consciousness

This feature is satisfied by any answer other than “alert” to the following 
question: Overall, how would you rate the patient’s level of consciousness: alert 
(normal), vigilant (hyperalert), lethargic (drowsy, easily aroused), stupor (difficult 
to arouse), or coma (unarousable)?

aInformation is usually obtained from a reliable reporter, such as a family member, 
caregiver, or nurse.

this  information,  many  patients  with  dementia  or  longstanding 
depression  may  be  mistaken  as  delirious  during  a  single  initial 
evaluation. Patients with a more hypoactive, apathetic presentation 
with psychomotor slowing may be identified as being different from 
baseline only through conversations with family members. A num-
ber of validated instruments have been shown to diagnose cognitive 
dysfunction accurately using a collateral source, including the mod-
ified Blessed Dementia Rating Scale and the Clinical Dementia Rat-
ing (CDR). Baseline cognitive impairment is common in patients 
with delirium. Even when no such history of cognitive impairment 
is  elicited,  there  should  still  be  a  high  suspicion  for  a  previously 
unrecognized underlying neurologic disorder.

Establishing the time course of cognitive change is important not 
only to make a diagnosis of delirium but also to correlate the onset 
of  the  illness  with  potentially  treatable  etiologies  such  as  recent 
medication changes or symptoms of systemic infection.

Medications  remain  a  common  cause  of  delirium,  especially 
compounds  with  anticholinergic  or  sedative  properties.  It  is  esti-
mated that nearly one-third of all cases of delirium are secondary to 
medications, especially in the elderly. Medication histories should 
include  all  prescription  as  well  as  over-the-counter  and  herbal 
substances taken by the patient and any recent changes in dosing 
or formulation, including substitution of generics for brand-name 
medications.

Other  important  elements  of  the  history  include  screening  for 
symptoms  of  organ  failure  or  systemic  infection,  which  often 
contributes to delirium in the elderly. A history of illicit drug use, 
alcoholism,  or  toxin  exposure  is  common  in  younger  delirious 
patients. Finally, asking the patient and collateral source about other 
symptoms that may accompany delirium, such as depression, may 
help identify potential therapeutic targets. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The  general  physical  examination  in  a  delirious  patient  should 
include  careful  screening  for  signs  of  infection  such  as  fever,  tac-
hypnea,  pulmonary  consolidation,  heart  murmur,  and  meningis-
mus. The patient’s fluid status should be assessed; both dehydration 
and fluid overload with resultant hypoxemia have been associated 
with delirium, and each is usually easily rectified. The appearance 
of the skin can be helpful, showing jaundice in hepatic encephal-
opathy,  cyanosis  in  hypoxemia,  or  needle  tracks  in  patients  using 
intravenous drugs.

The  neurologic  examination  requires  a  careful  assessment  of 
mental status. Patients with delirium often present with a fluctuat-
ing course; therefore, the diagnosis can be missed when one relies 
on a single time point of evaluation. For patients who worsen in the 
evening  (sundowning),  assessment  only  during  morning  rounds 
may be falsely reassuring.

An  altered  level  of  consciousness  ranging  from  hyperarousal 
to lethargy to coma is present in most patients with delirium and 
can be assessed easily at the bedside. In a patient with a relatively 
normal level of consciousness, a screen for an attentional deficit is 
in order, because this deficit is the classic neuropsychological hall-
mark of delirium. Attention can be assessed while taking a history 
from the patient. Tangential speech, a fragmentary flow of ideas, or 
inability to follow complex commands often signifies an attentional 
problem. There are formal neuropsychological tests to assess atten-
tion,  but  a  simple  bedside  test  of  digit  span  forward  is  quick  and 
fairly sensitive. In this task, patients are asked to repeat successively 
longer random strings of digits beginning with two digits in a row, 
said to the patient at one per second intervals. Healthy adults can 
repeat a string of five to seven digits before faltering; a digit span of 
four or less usually indicates an attentional deficit unless hearing or 
language barriers are present, and many patients with delirium have 
digit spans of three or fewer digits.

More formal neuropsychological testing can be helpful in assess-
ing  a  delirious  patient,  but  it  is  usually  too  cumbersome  and 
time-consuming  in  the  inpatient  setting.  A  Mini-Mental  State 

Examination (MMSE) provides information regarding orientation, 
language, and visuospatial skills (Chap. 29); however, performance 
of many tasks on the MMSE, including the spelling of “world” back-
ward and serial subtraction of digits, will be impaired by delirious 
patients’ attentional deficits, rendering the test unreliable.

The remainder of the screening neurologic examination should 
focus  on  identifying  new  focal  neurologic  deficits.  Focal  strokes 
or  mass  lesions  in  isolation  are  rarely  the  cause  of  delirium,  but 
patients with underlying extensive cerebrovascular disease or neu-
rodegenerative  conditions  may  not  be  able  to  cognitively  tolerate 
even  relatively  small  new  insults.  Patients  should  be  screened  for 
other signs of neurodegenerative conditions such as parkinsonism, 
which is seen not only in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease but also in 
other dementing conditions including Alzheimer’s disease, demen-
tia with Lewy bodies, and progressive supranuclear palsy. The pres-
ence of multifocal myoclonus or asterixis on the motor examination 
is nonspecific but usually indicates a metabolic or toxic etiology of 
the delirium. 

ETIOLOGY
Some  etiologies  can  be  easily  discerned  through  a  careful  history 
and physical examination, whereas others require confirmation with 
laboratory studies, imaging, or other ancillary tests. A large, diverse 
group of insults can lead to delirium, and the cause in many patients 
is multifactorial. Common etiologies are listed in Table 27-2.

Prescribed, over-the-counter, and herbal medications all can pre-
cipitate delirium. Drugs with anticholinergic properties, narcotics, 
and benzodiazepines are particularly common offenders, but nearly 
any compound can lead to cognitive dysfunction in a predisposed 
patient.  Whereas  an  elderly  patient  with  baseline  dementia  may 
become delirious upon exposure to a relatively low dose of a med-
ication,  in  less  susceptible  individuals,  delirium  occurs  only  with 
very high doses of the same medication. This observation empha-
sizes the importance of correlating the timing of recent medication 
changes, including dose and formulation, with the onset of cogni-
tive dysfunction.

In younger patients, illicit drugs and toxins are common causes 
of delirium. In addition to more classic drugs of abuse, the avail-
ability  of  “bath  salts,”  synthetic  cannabis  (Chap.  455),  methylen-
edioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA,  ecstasy),  γ-hydroxybutyrate 
(GHB),  and  the  phencyclidine  (PCP)-like  agent  ketamine  has  led 
to an increase in delirious young persons presenting to acute care 
settings  (Chap.  457).  Many  common  prescription  drugs  such  as 
oral  narcotics  and  benzodiazepines  are  often  abused  and  readily 
available on the street. Alcohol abuse leading to high serum levels 
causes confusion, but more commonly, it is withdrawal from alco-
hol that leads to a hyperactive delirium (Chap. 453). Alcohol and 
benzodiazepine  withdrawal  should  be  considered  in  all  cases  of 
delirium, including in the elderly, because even patients who drink 
only a few servings of alcohol every day can experience relatively 
severe withdrawal symptoms upon hospitalization.

Metabolic  abnormalities  such  as  electrolyte  disturbances  of 
sodium, calcium, magnesium, or glucose can cause delirium, and 
mild  derangements  can  lead  to  substantial  cognitive  disturbances 
in  susceptible  individuals.  Other  common  metabolic  etiologies 
include liver and renal failure, hypercarbia and hypoxemia, vitamin 
deficiencies of thiamine and B12, autoimmune disorders including 
central  nervous  system  (CNS)  vasculitis,  and  endocrinopathies 
such as thyroid and adrenal disorders.

Systemic infections often cause delirium, especially in the elderly. 
A common scenario involves the development of an acute cognitive 
decline in the setting of a urinary tract infection in a patient with 
baseline  dementia.  Pneumonia,  skin  infections  such  as  cellulitis, 
and frank sepsis also lead to delirium. This so-called septic enceph-
alopathy,  often  seen  in  the  ICU,  is  probably  due  to  the  release  of 
proinflammatory cytokines and their diffuse cerebral effects. CNS 
infections  such  as  meningitis,  encephalitis,  and  abscess  are  less 
common  etiologies  of  delirium,  as  are  cases  of  autoimmune  or

paraneoplastic encephalitis; however, in light of the high morbidity 
and  mortality  rates  associated  with  these  conditions  when  they 
are  not  treated,  clinicians  must  always  maintain  a  high  index  of 
suspicion.

In some susceptible individuals, exposure to the unfamiliar envi-
ronment of a hospital itself can contribute to delirium. This etiology 
usually  occurs  as  part  of  a  multifactorial  delirium  and  should  be 
considered a diagnosis of exclusion after all other causes have been 
thoroughly  investigated.  Many  primary  prevention  and  treatment 
strategies for delirium involve relatively simple methods to address 
the aspects of the inpatient setting that are most confusing.

Cerebrovascular etiologies of delirium are usually due to global 
hypoperfusion  in  the  setting  of  systemic  hypotension  from  heart 
failure, septic shock, dehydration, or anemia. Focal strokes in the 
right  parietal  lobe  and  medial  dorsal  thalamus  rarely  can  lead  to 
a  delirious  state.  A  more  common  scenario  involves  a  new  focal 
stroke  or  hemorrhage  causing  confusion  in  a  patient  who  has 
decreased  cerebral  reserve.  In  these  individuals,  it  is  sometimes 
difficult  to  distinguish  between  cognitive  dysfunction  resulting 
from  the  new  neurovascular  insult  itself  and  delirium  due  to  the 
infectious,  metabolic,  and  pharmacologic  complications  that  can 
accompany hospitalization after stroke.

Because a fluctuating course often is seen in delirium, intermit-
tent seizures may be overlooked when one is considering potential 
etiologies.  Both  nonconvulsive  status  epilepticus  and  recurrent 
focal  or  generalized  seizures  followed  by  postictal  confusion  can 
cause delirium; EEG remains essential for this diagnosis and should 
be  considered  whenever  the  etiology  of  delirium  remains  unclear 
following initial workup. Seizure activity spreading from an electri-
cal focus in a mass or infarct can explain global cognitive dysfunc-
tion caused by relatively small lesions.

It is extremely common for patients to experience delirium at the 
end of life in palliative care settings. This condition must be iden-
tified  and  treated  aggressively  because  it  is  an  important  cause  of 
patient and family discomfort at the end of life. It should be remem-
bered that these patients also may be suffering from more common 
etiologies of delirium such as systemic infection. 

LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
A cost-effective approach allows the history and physical examina-
tion to guide further tests. No single algorithm will fit all delirious 
patients  due  to  the  staggering  number  of  potential  etiologies,  but 
one stepwise approach is detailed in Table 27-3. If a clear precip-
itant such as an offending medication is identified, further testing 
may  not  be  required.  If,  however,  no  likely  etiology  is  uncovered 
with initial evaluation, an aggressive search for an underlying cause 
should be initiated.

Basic screening labs, including a complete blood count, electro-
lyte panel, and tests of liver and renal function, should be obtained 
in all patients with delirium. In elderly patients, screening for sys-
temic infection, including chest radiography, urinalysis and culture, 
and possibly blood cultures, is important. In younger individuals, 
serum and urine drug and toxicology screening may be appropriate 
earlier in the workup. Additional laboratory tests addressing other 
autoimmune,  endocrinologic,  metabolic,  and  infectious  etiologies 
should  be  reserved  for  patients  in  whom  the  diagnosis  remains 
unclear after initial testing.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that brain imaging in patients 
with delirium is often unhelpful. If, however, the initial workup is 
unrevealing,  most  clinicians  quickly  move  toward  imaging  of  the 
brain to exclude structural causes. A noncontrast computed tomog-
raphy (CT) scan can identify large masses and hemorrhages but is 
otherwise unlikely to help determine an etiology of delirium. The 
ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify most acute 
ischemic  strokes  as  well  as  to  provide  neuroanatomic  detail  that 
gives clues to possible infectious, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, 
and neoplastic conditions makes it the test of choice. Because MRI 
techniques  are  limited  by  availability,  speed  of  imaging,  patient’s 
cooperation, and contraindications, many clinicians begin with CT 
scanning and proceed to MRI if the etiology of delirium remains 
elusive.

Lumbar  puncture  (LP)  must  be  obtained  immediately  after 
neuroimaging for all patients in whom CNS infection is suspected. 
Spinal fluid examination can also be useful in identifying autoim-
mune, other inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. As a result, 
LP  should  be  considered  in  any  delirious  patient  with  a  negative 
workup.  EEG  remains  invaluable  if  seizures  are  considered  or  if 
there is no cause readily identified.

TREATMENT
Delirium

Management of delirium begins with treatment of the underlying 
inciting  factor  (e.g.,  patients  with  systemic  infections  should  be 
given  appropriate  antibiotics,  and  underlying  electrolyte  distur-
bances  should  be  judiciously  corrected).  These  treatments  often 
lead to prompt resolution of delirium. Blindly targeting the symp-
toms of delirium pharmacologically only serves to prolong the time 
patients  remain  in  the  confused  state  and  may  mask  important 
diagnostic information.

Relatively simple methods of supportive care can be highly effec-
tive (Fig. 27-1). Reorientation by the nursing staff and family com-
bined  with  visible  clocks,  calendars,  and  outside-facing  windows 
can  reduce  confusion.  Sensory  isolation  should  be  prevented  by 
providing  glasses  and  hearing  aids  to  patients  who  need  them. 
Sundowning can be addressed to a large extent through vigilance 
to  appropriate  sleep-wake  cycles.  During  the  day,  a  well-lit  room 
should  be  accompanied  by  activities  or  exercises  to  prevent  nap-
ping.  At  night,  a  quiet,  dark  environment  with  limited  interrup-
tions by staff can assure proper rest; melatonin can be considered 
before bed to promote sleep. These sleep-wake cycle interventions 
are  especially  important  in  the  ICU  setting  as  the  usual  constant 
24-h  activity  commonly  provokes  delirium.  Attempting  to  mimic 
the  home  environment  as  much  as  possible  also  has  been  shown 
to  help  treat  and  even  prevent  delirium.  Visits  from  friends  and

family  throughout  the  day  minimize  the  anxiety  associated  with 
the  constant  flow  of  new  faces  of  staff  and  physicians.  Allowing 
hospitalized patients to have access to home bedding, clothing, and 
nightstand objects makes the hospital environment less foreign and 
therefore less confusing. Simple standard nursing practices such as 
maintaining  proper  nutrition  and  volume  status  as  well  as  man-
aging  pain,  incontinence,  and  skin  breakdown  also  help  alleviate 
discomfort and resulting confusion.

In some instances, patients pose a threat to their own safety or 
to the safety of staff members, and acute management is required. 
Bed  alarms  and  personal  sitters  are  more  effective  and  much  less 
disorienting  than  physical  restraints.  Chemical  restraints  should 
be avoided, but when necessary, very-low-dose typical or atypical 
antipsychotic medications administered on an as-needed basis can 
be used, recognizing that clinical trials have consistently shown that 
these  medications  are  ineffective  in  treating  delirium.  Therefore, 
they  should  be  reserved  for  patients  who  display  severe  agitation 
and  significant  potential  to  harm  themselves  or  staff.  The  associ-
ation  of  antipsychotic  use  in  the  elderly  with  increased  mortality 
rates underscores the importance of using these medications judi-
ciously  and  only  as  a  last  resort.  Benzodiazepines  often  worsen

nicians  use  benzodiazepines  to  treat  acute  confusion,  their  use 
should be limited to cases in which delirium is caused by alcohol or 
benzodiazepine withdrawal.

 ■ PREVENTION
In  light  of  the  high  morbidity  associated  with  delirium  and  the  tre-
mendously increased health care costs that accompany it, development 
of an effective strategy to prevent delirium in hospitalized patients is 
extremely  important.  Successful  identification  of  high-risk  patients 
is  the  first  step,  followed  by  initiation  of  appropriate  interventions. 
Increasingly,  hospitals  are  using  nursing  or  physician-administered 
tools to screen for high-risk individuals, triggering simple standardized 
protocols  used  to  manage  risk  factors  for  delirium,  including  sleep-
wake  cycle  reversal,  immobility,  visual  impairment,  hearing  impair-
ment,  sleep  deprivation,  and  dehydration.  No  specific  medications 
have  been  definitively  shown  to  be  effective  for  delirium  prevention, 
including  trials  of  cholinesterase  inhibitors  and  antipsychotic  agents. 
Melatonin  and  its  agonist  ramelteon  have  shown  some  promising 
results  in  small  preliminary  trials.  Recent  studies  in  the  ICU  have 
focused both on identifying sedatives, such as dexmedetomidine, that 
are less likely to lead to delirium in critically ill patients and on devel-
oping  protocols  for  daily  awakenings  in  which  infusions  of  sedative 
medications are interrupted and the patient is reorientated by the staff. 
All hospitals and health care systems should work toward decreasing 
the incidence of delirium and promptly recognizing and treating the 
disorder when it occurs.

28 Coma

S. Andrew Josephson, Allan H. Ropper,  
Stephen L. Hauser

Coma  is  among  the  most  common  neurologic  emergencies  encoun-
tered general medicine and requires an organized approach. It accounts 
for a substantial portion of admissions to emergency wards and occurs 
on all hospital services.

There  exists  a  continuum  of  states  of  reduced  alertness,  the  most 
severe  form  being  coma,  defined  as  a  deep  sleeplike  state  with  eyes 
closed,  from  which  the  patient  cannot  be  aroused.  Stupor  refers  to  a 
lower threshold for arousability, in which the patient can be transiently 
awakened  by  vigorous  stimuli,  accompanied  by  motor  behavior  that 
leads  to  avoidance  or  withdrawal  from  noxious  stimuli.  Drowsiness 
simulates light sleep and is characterized by easy arousal that may per-
sist for brief periods. Stupor and drowsiness are usually accompanied 
by some degree of confusion when the patient is alerted (Chap. 27). 
A precise narrative description of the level of arousal and of the type 
of  responses  evoked  by  various  stimuli  as  observed  at  the  bedside  is

preferable to use of ambiguous terms such as lethargy, semicoma, or 
obtundation.

Several  conditions  that  render  patients  unresponsive  and  simulate 
coma  are  considered  separately  because  of  their  special  significance. 
The  vegetative  state  signifies  an  awake-appearing  but  nonresponsive 
state, usually encountered in a patient who has emerged from coma. 
In  the  vegetative  state,  the  eyelids  may  open  periodically,  giving  the 
appearance of  wakefulness.  Respiratory and autonomic  functions  are 
retained.  Yawning,  coughing,  swallowing,  and  limb  and  head  move-
ments  persist,  but  there  are  few,  if  any,  meaningful  responses  to  the 
external and internal environment. There are typically accompanying 
signs  that  indicate  extensive  damage  in  both  cerebral  hemispheres, 
e.g.,  decerebrate  or  decorticate  limb  posturing  and  absent  responses 
to visual stimuli (see below). In the closely related but less severe min-
imally conscious state, the patient displays rudimentary vocal or motor 
behaviors,  often  spontaneous,  but  sometimes  in  response  to  touch, 
visual  stimuli,  or  command.  Cardiac  arrest  with  cerebral  hypoperfu-
sion and head trauma are the most common causes of the vegetative 
and minimally conscious states (Chap. 307).

The  prognosis  for  regaining  meaningful  mental  faculties  once  the 
vegetative state has supervened for several months is poor, and after a 
year, almost nil; hence the term persistent vegetative state. Most reports 
of  dramatic  recovery,  when  investigated  carefully,  are  found  to  yield 
to the usual rules for prognosis, but there have been rare instances in 
which recovery has occurred to a severely disabled condition and, in 
rare childhood cases, to an even better state. Patients in the minimally 
conscious state carry a better prognosis for some recovery compared 
to those in a persistent vegetative state, but even in these patients, dra-
matic recovery after 12 months is unusual.

The  possibility  of  incorrectly  attributing  meaningful  behavior 
to  patients  in  the  vegetative  and  minimally  conscious  states  creates 
problems  and  anguish  for  families  and  physicians.  The  question  of 
whether  some  of  these  patients  have  the  capability  for  cognition  has 
been investigated by functional MRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) 
studies  that  have  demonstrated  cerebral  activation  that  is  temporally 
consistent in response to verbal and other stimuli, as discussed in more 
detail below. This finding suggests at a minimum that some of these 
patients could in the future be able to communicate their needs using 
technological advances and that further research could shed light on 
treatment approaches targeting areas of the brain and their connections 
that seem to be preserved in individual patients.

Several  syndromes  that  affect  alertness  are  prone  to  be  misinter-
preted  as  stupor  or  coma,  and  clinicians  should  be  aware  of  these 
pitfalls when diagnosing coma at the bedside. Akinetic mutism refers 
to a partially or fully awake state in which the patient remains virtually 
immobile  and  mute  but  can  form  impressions  and  think,  as  demon-
strated by later recounting of events. This condition results from dam-
age  in  the  regions  of  the  medial  thalamic  nuclei  or  the  frontal  lobes 
(particularly  lesions  situated  deeply  or  on  the  orbitofrontal  surfaces) 
or  from  extreme  hydrocephalus.  The  term  abulia  describes  a  milder 
form of akinetic mutism characterized by mental and physical slowness 
and diminished ability to initiate activity. It is also usually the result of 
damage to the medial frontal lobes and their connections (Chap. 30).

Catatonia is a hypomobile and mute syndrome that occurs usually 
as part of a major psychosis, typically schizophrenia or major depres-
sion. Catatonic patients make few voluntary or responsive movements, 
although  they  blink,  swallow,  and  may  not  appear  distressed.  There 
are nevertheless signs that the patient is responsive, although it takes 
a  careful  examination  to  demonstrate  these  features.  For  example, 
eyelid  elevation  is  actively  resisted,  blinking  occurs  in  response  to  a 
visual threat, and the eyes move concomitantly with head rotation, all 
of which are inconsistent with the presence of a brain lesion causing 
unresponsiveness. The limbs may retain postures in which they have 
been  placed  by  the  examiner  (“waxy  flexibility,”  or  catalepsy).  With 
recovery from catatonia, patients often have some memory of events 
that  occurred  during  their  stupor.  Catatonia  is  superficially  similar 
to  akinetic  mutism,  but  clinical  evidence  of  cerebral  damage  such  as 
hyperreflexia and hypertonicity of the limbs is lacking in the former. 
The special problem of coma in brain death is discussed below.

The  locked-in  state  describes  a  type  of  pseudocoma  in  which  an 
awake but paralyzed patient has no means of producing speech or voli-
tional  limb  movement  but  retains  voluntary  vertical  eye  movements 
and lid elevation, thus allowing the patient to communicate. The pupils 
are  normally  reactive.  The  usual  cause  is  an  infarction  (e.g.,  basilar 
artery  thrombosis)  or  hemorrhage  of  the  bilateral  ventral  pons  that 
transects all descending motor (corticospinal and corticobulbar) path-
ways. Another awake but de-efferented state occurs as a result of total 
paralysis  of  the  musculature  in  severe  cases  of  neuromuscular  weak-
ness  such  as  in  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  (Chap. 447),  critical  illness 
neuropathy (Chap. 307), or pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade.
 ■ THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF COMA
Almost  all  instances  of  coma  can  be  traced  to  either  (1)  widespread 
abnormalities of the cerebral hemispheres or (2) reduced activity of the 
thalamocortical alerting system, the reticular activating system (RAS), 
which  is  an  assemblage  of  neurons  located  diffusely  in  the  upper 
brainstem  and  thalamus.  The  proper  functioning  of  this  system,  its 
ascending projections to the cortex, and the cortex itself are required to 
maintain alertness and coherence of thought. In addition to structural 
damage to either or both of these systems, suppression of reticulocere-
bral function commonly occurs by drugs, toxins, or metabolic derange-
ments such as hypoglycemia, anoxia, uremia, and hepatic failure, or by 
seizures; these types of metabolic causes of coma are far more common 
than structural injuries.
Coma  Due  to  Cerebral  Mass  Lesions  and  Herniation  
Syndromes  The skull prevents outward expansion of the brain, and 
infoldings of the dura create compartments that restrict displacement 
of brain tissue within the cranium. The two cerebral hemispheres are 
separated by the falx and the anterior and posterior fossae by the tento-
rium. Herniation refers to displacement of brain tissue by an intracere-
bral or overlying mass into a contiguous compartment that it normally 
does not occupy. Coma from mass lesions, and many of its associated 
signs, are attributable to these tissue shifts, and certain clinical features 
are characteristic of specific configurations of herniation (Fig. 28-1).

In the most common form of herniation, brain tissue is displaced 
from the supratentorial to the infratentorial compartment through the 
tentorial  opening,  referred  to  as  transtentorial  herniation.  The  cause 
is  often  a  mass  hemispheral  lesion,  with  accompanying  contralateral 
hemiparesis. Uncal transtentorial herniation refers to impaction of the 
anterior medial temporal gyrus (the uncus) into the tentorial opening 
just anterior to and adjacent to the midbrain (Fig. 28-1A). The uncus 
can compress the third nerve as the nerve traverses the subarachnoid 
space,  causing  enlargement  of  the  ipsilateral  pupil  as  the  first  sign 
(the fibers subserving parasympathetic pupillary function are located

meningioma. A. The upper midbrain is compressed and displaced horizontally away

peripherally  in  the  nerve).  The  coma  that  typically  follows  is  due  to 
lateral displacement of the midbrain (and therefore the RAS) against 
the  opposite  tentorial  edge  by  the  displaced  parahippocampal  gyrus 
(Fig. 28-2), compressing the opposite cerebral peduncle and producing 
a  Babinski  sign  and  ipsilateral  hemiparesis  (the  Kernohan-Woltman 
sign). Herniation may also compress the anterior and posterior cere-
bral arteries as they pass over the tentorial reflections, with resultant 
brain  infarction.  These  distortions  may  also  entrap  portions  of  the 
ventricular system, causing hydrocephalus.

Central  transtentorial  herniation  denotes  a  symmetric  downward 
movement  of  the  thalamic  structures  through  the  tentorial  opening 
with  compression  of  the  upper  midbrain  (Fig.  28-1B).  Miotic  pupils 
and  drowsiness  are  the  heralding  signs,  in  contrast  to  a  unilaterally 
enlarged pupil of the uncal syndrome. Both uncal and central transten-
torial herniations cause progressive compression of the brainstem and 
RAS, with initial damage to the midbrain, then the pons, and finally 
the medulla. The result is an approximate sequence of neurologic signs 
that corresponds to each affected level, with respiratory centers in the 
brainstem  often  spared  until  late  in  the  herniation  syndrome.  Other 
forms of herniation include transfalcial herniation (displacement of the 
cingulate gyrus under the falx and across the midline, Fig. 28-1C) and 
foraminal herniation (downward forcing of the cerebellar tonsils into 
the foramen magnum, Fig. 28-1D), which causes early compression of 
the medulla, respiratory arrest, and death.

Coma  Due  to  Metabolic,  Drug,  and  Toxic  Disorders  Many 
systemic metabolic abnormalities cause coma by interrupting the deliv-
ery of energy substrates (e.g., oxygen, glucose) or by altering neuronal 
excitability  (drugs  and  alcohol,  anesthesia,  and  epilepsy).  These  are 
the most common causes of coma in large case series. The metabolic 
abnormalities that produce coma may, in milder forms, induce a con-
fusional state (metabolic encephalopathy) in which clouded conscious-
ness and coma are in a continuum.

Cerebral  neurons  are  dependent  on  cerebral  blood  flow  (CBF)  and 
the  delivery  of  oxygen  and  glucose.  Brain  stores  of  glucose  are  able  to 
provide energy for ~2 min after blood flow is interrupted, and oxygen 
stores  last  8–10  s  after  the  cessation  of  blood  flow.  Simultaneous 
hypoxia and ischemia exhaust glucose more rapidly. The EEG rhythm 
in these circumstances becomes diffusely slowed, typical of metabolic 
encephalopathies, and as substrate delivery worsens, eventually brain 
electrical activity ceases.

Unlike hypoxia-ischemia, which first causes a metabolic encephal-
opathy due to reduced energy substrate but ultimately causes neuronal 
destruction, most metabolic disorders such as hypoglycemia, hypona-
tremia, hyperosmolarity, hypercapnia, hypercalcemia, and hepatic and 
renal  failure  cause  no  or  only  minor  neuropathologic  changes  in  the 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   184

21/01/22   3:37 PM

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesbrain.  The  reversible  effects  of  these  conditions  are  not  fully  under-
stood  but  may  result  from  impaired  energy  supplies,  changes  in  ion 
fluxes  across  neuronal  membranes,  and  neurotransmitter  abnormal-
ities.  In  hepatic  encephalopathy  (HE),  high  ammonia  concentrations 
lead  to  increased  synthesis  of  glutamine  in  astrocytes  and  osmotic 
swelling of the cells, mitochondrial energy failure, production of reac-
tive  nitrogen  and  oxygen  species,  increases  in  the  inhibitory  neuro-
transmitter GABA, and synthesis of putative “false” neurotransmitters. 
Over time, development of a diffuse astrocytosis is typical of chronic 
HE. Which, if any, of these is responsible for coma is not known.

The mechanism of the encephalopathy of renal failure is also uncer-
tain and likely to be multifactorial; unlike ammonia, urea does not pro-
duce central nervous system (CNS) depression. Contributors to uremic 
encephalopathy  may  include  accumulation  of  neurotoxic  substances 
such  as  creatinine,  guanidine,  and  related  compounds;  depletion  of 
catecholamines; altered glutamate and GABA tone; increases in brain 
calcium; inflammation with disruption of the blood-brain barrier; and 
frequent coexisting vascular disease.

Coma and seizures are common accompaniments of large shifts in 
sodium and water balance in the brain. These changes in osmolarity 
arise from systemic medical disorders, including diabetic ketoacidosis, 
the nonketotic hyperosmolar state, and hyponatremia from any cause 
(e.g.,  water  intoxication,  excessive  secretion  of  antidiuretic  hormone, 
or atrial natriuretic peptides). Sodium levels <125 mmol/L, especially 
if  achieved  quickly,  induce  confusion,  and  levels  <119  mmol/L  are 
typically  associated  with  coma  and  convulsions.  In  hyperosmolar 
coma, the serum osmolarity is generally >350 mosmol/L. Hypercapnia 
depresses the level of consciousness in proportion to the rise in carbon 
dioxide (CO2) in the blood. In all of these metabolic encephalopathies, 
the degree of neurologic change depends on the rapidity with which 
the  serum  changes  occur.  The  pathophysiology  of  other  metabolic 
encephalopathies such as those due to hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, 
vitamin B12 deficiency, and hypothermia are incompletely understood 
but must reflect derangements of CNS biochemistry, membrane func-
tion, or neurotransmitters.

Comas  due  to  drugs  and  toxins  are  typically  reversible  and  leave 
no  residual  damage  provided  there  has  not  been  hypoxia  or  severe 
hypotension.  Many  drugs  and  toxins  are  capable  of  depressing  ner-
vous system function. Some produce coma by affecting both the RAS 
and  the  cerebral  cortex.  The  combination  of  cortical  and  brainstem 
signs, which occurs occasionally in certain drug overdoses, may lead 
to an incorrect diagnosis of structural brainstem disease. Overdose of 
medications that have atropinic actions produces signs such as dilated 
pupils,  tachycardia,  and  dry  skin;  opiate  overdose  produces  pinpoint 
pupils <1 mm in diameter. Some drug intoxications, typified by barbi-
turates, can mimic all of the signs of brain death; thus, toxic etiologies 
should be excluded prior to making a diagnosis of brain death.

Epileptic Coma  Generalized electrical seizures are associated with 
coma, even in the absence of motor convulsions (nonconvulsive status 
epilepticus). As a result, EEG monitoring is often used in the evaluation 
of unexplained coma to exclude this treatable etiology. The self-limited 
coma that follows a seizure, the postictal state, may be due to exhaus-
tion  of  energy  reserves  or  effects  of  locally  toxic  molecules  that  are 
the  by-product  of  seizures.  The  postictal  state  produces  continuous, 
generalized slowing of the background EEG activity similar to that of 
metabolic encephalopathies. It typically lasts for a few minutes but in 
some cases can be prolonged for hours or even rarely for days.

Coma Due to Widespread Structural Damage to the Cerebral 
Hemispheres  This  category,  comprising  several  unrelated  disor-
ders,  results  from  extensive  bilateral  structural  cerebral  damage.  The 
clinical  appearance  simulates  a  metabolic  encephalopathy.  Hypoxia- 
ischemia is perhaps the best characterized form of this type of injury, 
in which it is not possible initially to distinguish the acute reversible 
effects of oxygen deprivation of the brain from the subsequent effects 
of anoxic neuronal damage. Similar cerebral damage may be produced 
by disorders that occlude widespread small blood vessels throughout 
the  brain;  examples  include  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura, 

hyperviscosity,  and  cerebral  malaria.  Diffuse  white  matter  damage 
from cranial trauma or inflammatory demyelinating diseases can cause 
a similar coma syndrome.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Coma

A video examination of the comatose patient is shown in Chap. V4. 
Acute respiratory and cardiovascular problems should be attended 
to  prior  to  neurologic  assessment.  In  most  instances,  a  complete 
medical evaluation, except for vital signs, funduscopy, and exami-
nation  for  nuchal  rigidity,  may  be  deferred  until  the  neurologic 
evaluation  has  established  the  severity  and  nature  of  coma.  The 
approach  to  the  patient  with  coma  from  cranial  trauma  is  dis-
cussed in Chap. 443. 
HISTORY
The  cause  of  coma  may  be  immediately  evident  as  in  cases  of 
trauma, cardiac arrest, or observed drug ingestion. In the remain-
der,  certain  points  are  useful:  (1)  the  circumstances  and  rapidity 
with which neurologic symptoms developed; (2) antecedent symp-
toms  (confusion,  weakness,  headache,  fever,  seizures,  dizziness, 
double vision, or vomiting); (3) the use of medications, drugs, or 
alcohol; and (4) chronic liver, kidney, lung, heart, or other medical 
disease.  Direct  interrogation  of  family,  observers,  and  emergency 
medical technicians on the scene, in person or by telephone, is an 
important part of the evaluation when possible. 
GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Signs of head trauma raise the possibility of coexisting spinal cord 
injury,  and  in  such  cases,  immobilization  of  the  cervical  spine  is 
essential to prevent further injury. Fever suggests a systemic infec-
tion,  bacterial  meningitis,  encephalitis,  heat  stroke,  neuroleptic 
malignant  syndrome,  malignant  hyperthermia  due  to  anesthetics, 
or  anticholinergic  drug  intoxication.  Only  rarely  is  fever  attrib-
utable  to  a  lesion  that  has  disturbed  hypothalamic  temperature- 
regulating centers (“central fever”), and this diagnosis should only 
be  considered  after  an  exhaustive  search  for  other  causes  fails 
to  reveal  an  explanation  for  fever.  A  slight  elevation  in  tempera-
ture  may  follow  vigorous  convulsions.  Hypothermia  is  observed 
with  alcohol,  barbiturate,  sedative,  or  phenothiazine  intoxication; 
hypoglycemia;  peripheral  circulatory  failure;  or  extreme  hypothy-
roidism. Hypothermia itself causes coma when the temperature is 
<31°C (87.8°F) regardless of the underlying etiology; less dramati-
cally low body temperatures can also cause coma in some instances. 
Tachypnea may indicate systemic acidosis or pneumonia. Aberrant 
respiratory  patterns  that  reflect  brainstem  disorders  are  discussed 
below.  Marked  hypertension  suggests  hypertensive  encephalopa-
thy, cerebral hemorrhage, large cerebral infarction, or head injury. 
Hypotension is characteristic of coma from alcohol or barbiturate 
intoxication, internal hemorrhage or myocardial infarction causing 
poor delivery of blood to the brain, sepsis, profound hypothyroid-
ism, or Addisonian crisis. The funduscopic examination can detect 
increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (papilledema), subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (subhyaloid hemorrhages), and hypertensive enceph-
alopathy (exudates, hemorrhages, vessel-crossing changes, papille-
dema). Cutaneous petechiae suggest thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura, meningococcemia, or a bleeding diathesis associated with 
an intracerebral hemorrhage. Cyanosis and reddish or anemic skin 
coloration are other indications of an underlying systemic disease 
or carbon monoxide as responsible for the coma. 
NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION
The  patient  should  first  be  observed  without  intervention  by  the 
examiner. Spontaneously moving about the bed, reaching up toward 
the face, crossing legs, yawning, swallowing, coughing, and moan-
ing reflect a drowsy state that is close to normal awakeness. Lack of 
restless movements on one side or an outturned leg suggests hemi-
plegia. Subtle, intermittent twitching movements of a foot, finger, or 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   185

facial muscle may be the only sign of seizures. Multifocal myoclonus 
usually indicates a metabolic disorder, particularly uremia, anoxia, 
drug intoxication, or rarely a prion disease (Chap. 438). In a drowsy 
and  confused  patient,  bilateral  asterixis  is  a  sign  of  metabolic 
encephalopathy or drug intoxication.

Decorticate  rigidity  and  decerebrate  rigidity,  or  “posturing,” 
describe stereotyped arm and leg movements occurring spontane-
ously or elicited by sensory stimulation. Flexion of the elbows and 
wrists and supination of the arm (decorticate posturing) classically 
suggest bilateral damage rostral to the midbrain, whereas extension 
of  the  elbows  and  wrists  with  pronation  (decerebrate  posturing) 
indicates damage to motor tracts caudal to the midbrain. However, 
these localizations have been adapted from animal work and cannot 
be  applied  with  precision  to  coma  in  humans.  In  fact,  acute  and 
widespread disorders of any type, regardless of location, frequently 
cause limb extension. 

LEVEL OF AROUSAL
A sequence of increasingly intense stimuli is first used to determine 
the threshold for arousal and the motor response of each side of the 
body. The results of testing may vary from minute to minute, and 
serial  examinations  are  useful.  Tickling  the  nostrils  with  a  cotton 
wisp  is  a  moderate  stimulus  to  arousal—all  but  deeply  stuporous 
and comatose patients will move the head away and arouse to some 
degree. An even greater degree of responsiveness is present if the 
patient  uses  his  hand  to  remove  an  offending  stimulus.  Pressure 
on  bony  prominences  and  pinprick  stimulation,  when  necessary, 
are  humane  forms  of  noxious  stimuli;  pinching  the  skin  causes 
ecchymoses  and  is  generally  not  performed  but  may  be  useful  in 
eliciting abduction withdrawal movements of the limbs. Posturing 
in response to noxious stimuli indicates severe damage to the corti-
cospinal system, whereas abduction-avoidance movement of a limb 
is  usually  purposeful  and  denotes  an  intact  corticospinal  system. 
Posturing may also be unilateral and coexist with purposeful limb 
movements, reflecting incomplete damage to the motor system. 

BRAINSTEM REFLEXES
Assessment  of  brainstem  function  is  essential  to  localization  of 
the lesion in coma (Fig. 28-3). Patients with preserved brainstem 
reflexes typically have a bihemispheric localization to coma, includ-
ing  toxic  or  drug  intoxication,  whereas  patients  with  abnormal 
brainstem reflexes either have a lesion in the brainstem or a hernia-
tion syndrome from a cerebral mass lesion impacting the brainstem 
secondarily.  The  most  important  brainstem  reflexes  are  pupillary 
size and reaction to light, spontaneous and elicited eye movements, 
corneal responses, and the respiratory pattern. 
Pupillary  Signs  Pupillary  reactions  are  examined  with  a  bright, 
diffuse  light.  Reactive  and  round  pupils  of  midsize  (2.5–5  mm) 
essentially exclude upper midbrain damage, either primary or sec-
ondary  to  compression  from  herniation.  A  response  to  light  may 
be difficult to appreciate in pupils <2 mm in diameter, and bright 
room lighting may mute pupillary reactivity. One enlarged (>6 mm) 
and poorly reactive pupil signifies compression of the third nerve 
from the effects of a cerebral mass above. Enlargement of the pupil 
contralateral to a hemispheral mass may occur but is infrequent. An 
oval and slightly eccentric pupil is a transitional sign that accompa-
nies  early  midbrain–third  nerve  compression.  The  most  extreme 
pupillary  sign,  bilaterally  dilated  and  unreactive  pupils,  indicates 
severe midbrain damage, usually from compression by a supraten-
torial  mass.  Ingestion  of  drugs  with  anticholinergic  activity,  the 
use of mydriatic eye drops, nebulizer treatments, and direct ocular 
trauma are other causes of pupillary enlargement.

Reactive  and  bilaterally  small  (1–2.5  mm)  but  not  pinpoint 
pupils are seen in metabolic encephalopathies or in deep bilateral 
hemispheral  lesions  such  as  hydrocephalus  or  thalamic  hemor-
rhage.  Even  smaller  reactive  pupils  (<1  mm)  characterize  opioid 
overdoses but also occur with extensive pontine hemorrhage. The 
response to naloxone and the presence of reflex eye movements (see

FIGURE 28-3  Examination of brainstem reflexes in coma. Midbrain and third nerve 
function are tested by pupillary reaction to light, pontine function by spontaneous 
and  reflex  eye  movements  and  corneal  responses,  and  medullary  function  by

are  dependent  on  the  medial  longitudinal  fasciculus  (MLF)  interconnecting  the 
sixth and contralateral third nerve nuclei. Head rotation (oculocephalic reflex) or 
caloric stimulation of the labyrinths (oculovestibular reflex) elicits contraversive eye 
movements (for details, see text).

below) assist in distinguishing between these. Unilateral miosis in 
coma  has  been  attributed  to  dysfunction  of  sympathetic  efferents 
originating  in  the  posterior  hypothalamus  and  descending  in  the 
tegmentum of the brainstem to the cervical cord. It is an occasional 
finding in patients with a large cerebral hemorrhage that affects the 
thalamus. 
Ocular  Movements  The  eyes  are  first  observed  by  elevating  the 
lids  and  observing  the  resting  position  and  spontaneous  move-
ments of the globes. Horizontal divergence of the eyes at rest is nor-
mal in drowsiness. As coma deepens, the ocular axes may become 
parallel again.

Spontaneous eye movements in coma often take the form of con-
jugate  horizontal  roving.  This  finding  alone  exonerates  extensive 
damage  in  the  midbrain  and  pons  and  has  the  same  significance 
as normal reflex eye movements (see below). Conjugate horizontal 
ocular deviation to one side indicates damage to the frontal lobe on 
the same side or less commonly the pons on the opposite side. This 
phenomenon is summarized by the following maxim: The eyes look 
toward a hemispheral lesion and away from a brainstem lesion. Sei-
zures involving the frontal lobe drive the eyes to the opposite side, 
simulating a pontine destructive lesion. The eyes may occasionally 
turn paradoxically away from the side of a deep hemispheral lesion 
(“wrong-way eyes”). The eyes turn down and inward with thalamic 
and upper midbrain lesions, typically thalamic hemorrhage. “Ocular 
bobbing” describes brisk downward and slow upward movements 
of the eyes associated with loss of horizontal eye movements and is 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   186

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesdiagnostic of bilateral pontine damage, usually from thrombosis of 
the basilar artery. “Ocular dipping” is a slower, arrhythmic down-
ward movement followed by a faster upward movement in patients 
with normal reflex horizontal gaze; it usually indicates diffuse cor-
tical anoxic damage.

The  oculocephalic  reflexes,  elicited  by  moving  the  head  from 
side  to  side  or  vertically  and  observing  eye  movements  in  the 
direction opposite to the head movement, depend on the integrity 
of  the  ocular  motor  nuclei  and  their  interconnecting  tracts  that 
extend from the midbrain to the pons and medulla (Fig. 28-3). The 
movements, called somewhat inaccurately “doll’s eyes,” are normally 
suppressed in the awake patient with intact frontal lobes. The abil-
ity to elicit them therefore reflects both reduced cortical influence 
on the brainstem and intact brainstem pathways. The opposite, an 
absence of reflex eye movements, usually signifies damage within 
the brainstem but can result from overdoses of certain drugs. In this 
circumstance, normal pupillary size and light reaction distinguishes 
most drug-induced comas from structural brainstem damage. Ocu-
locephalic maneuvers should not be attempted in patients with neck 
trauma,  as  vigorous  head  movements  can  precipitate  or  worsen  a 
spinal cord injury.

(oculovestibular response) provides a more intense stimulus for the 
oculocephalic reflex but provides essentially the same information. 
The test is performed by irrigating the external auditory canal with 
cold water in order to induce convection currents in the labyrinths. 
After a brief latency, the result is tonic deviation of both eyes to the 
side of cold-water irrigation. In comatose patients, nystagmus in the 
opposite direction may not occur. The acronym “COWS” has been 
used  to  remind  generations  of  medical  students  of  the  direction 
of  nystagmus—cold  water  opposite,  warm  water  same—but  since 
nystagmus is often absent in the opposite direction due to frontal 
lobe dysfunction in coma, this mnemonic does not often hold true.
The corneal reflex, elicited by touching the cornea with a wisp of 
cotton and observing bilateral lid closure, depends on the integrity 
of pontine pathways between the fifth (afferent) and both seventh 
(efferent)  cranial  nerves;  it  is  a  useful  test  of  pontine  function. 
CNS-depressant drugs diminish or eliminate the corneal responses 
soon after reflex eye movements are paralyzed but before the pupils 
become unreactive to light. The corneal response may be lost for a 
time on the side of an acute hemiplegia. 
Respiratory Patterns  These are of less localizing value in compar-
ison to other brainstem signs. Shallow, slow, but regular breathing 
suggests  metabolic  or  drug-induced  depression  of  the  medullary 
respiratory  centers.  Cheyne-Stokes  respiration  in  its  typical  cyclic 
form,  ending  with  a  brief  apneic  period,  signifies  bihemispheral 
damage or metabolic suppression and commonly accompanies light 
coma. Rapid, deep (Kussmaul) breathing usually implies metabolic 
acidosis but may also occur with pontomesencephalic lesions. Ago-
nal gasps are the result of lower brainstem (medullary) damage and 
are  recognized  as  the  terminal  respiratory  pattern  of  severe  brain 
damage.  Other  cyclic  breathing  patterns  have  been  described  but 
are of lesser significance.

 ■ LABORATORY STUDIES AND IMAGING
The studies that are most useful in the diagnosis of coma are chemical-
toxicologic analysis of blood and urine, cranial CT or MRI, EEG, and 
cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  examination.  Arterial  blood  gas  analysis 
is  helpful  in  patients  with  lung  disease  and  acid-base  disorders.  The 
metabolic aberrations commonly encountered in clinical practice are 
usually  revealed  by  measurement  of  electrolytes,  glucose,  calcium, 
magnesium,  osmolarity,  and  renal  (blood  urea  nitrogen)  and  hepatic 
(NH3)  function.  Toxicologic  analysis  may  be  necessary  in  cases  of 
acute  coma,  when  the  diagnosis  is  not  immediately  clear.  However, 
the  presence  of  exogenous  drugs  or  toxins,  especially  alcohol,  does 
not exclude the possibility that other factors, particularly head trauma, 
are  contributing  to  the  clinical  state.  An  ethanol  level  of  43  mmol/L

(0.2 g/dL) in nonhabituated patients generally causes impaired mental 
activity; a level of >65 mmol/L (0.3 g/dL) is associated with stupor. The 
development of tolerance may allow some chronic alcoholics to remain 
awake at levels >87 mmol/L (0.4 g/dL).

The  availability  of  cranial  CT  and  MRI  has  focused  attention  on 
causes of coma that are detectable by imaging (e.g., hemorrhage, tumor, 
or  hydrocephalus).  Resorting  primarily  to  this  approach,  although 
at  times  expedient,  is  imprudent  because  most  cases  of  coma  (and 
confusion)  are  metabolic  or  toxic  in  origin.  Furthermore,  a  normal 
CT  scan  does  not  exclude  an  anatomic  lesion  as  the  cause  of  coma; 
for  example,  early  bilateral  hemisphere  infarction,  acute  brainstem 
infarction, encephalitis, meningitis, mechanical shearing of axons as a 
result of closed head trauma, sagittal sinus thrombosis, hypoxic injury, 
and  subdural  hematoma  isodense  to  adjacent  brain  are  some  of  the 
disorders that may not be detected. Sometimes imaging results can be 
misleading such as when small subdural hematomas or old strokes are 
found, but the patient’s coma is due to intoxication. Additional imaging 
with CT angiography or MRI can be obtained if acute posterior circu-
lation stroke is considered.

The EEG (Chap. 425) provides clues in metabolic or drug-induced 
states  but  is  rarely  diagnostic  in  these  disorders.  However,  it  is  the 
essential test to reveal coma due to nonconvulsive seizures and shows 
fairly characteristic patterns in herpesvirus encephalitis and prion dis-
ease. The EEG may be further helpful in disclosing generalized slowing 
of the background activity, a reflection of the severity of an encephal-
opathy. Predominant high-voltage slowing (δ or triphasic waves) in the 
frontal regions is typical of metabolic coma, as from hepatic failure, and 
widespread  fast  (β)  activity  implicates  overdose  with  sedative  drugs 
(e.g., benzodiazepines). A special pattern of “alpha coma,” defined by 
widespread,  variable  8-  to  12-Hz  activity,  superficially  resembles  the 
normal α rhythm of waking but, unlike normal α activity, is not altered 
by environmental stimuli. Alpha coma results from pontine or diffuse 
cortical damage and is associated with a poor prognosis. A unique EEG 
pattern in adults of “extreme delta brush” is characteristic of a specific 
(anti–N-methyl-d-aspartate  [NMDA]  receptor)  form  of  autoimmune 
encephalitis.  Normal  α  activity  on  the  EEG,  which  is  suppressed  by 
stimulating the patient, also alerts the clinician to the locked-in syn-
drome, hysteria, or catatonia.

Lumbar puncture should be performed if no cause is readily appar-
ent, as examination of the CSF remains indispensable in the diagnosis 
of  various  forms  of  meningitis  and  encephalitis.  An  imaging  study 
should be performed prior to lumbar puncture to exclude a large intra-
cranial mass lesion, which could lead to herniation with lumbar punc-
ture. Blood cultures and administration of antibiotics should precede 
the imaging study if infectious meningitis is suspected (Chap. 138).

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF COMA
(Table 28-1) The causes of coma can be divided into three broad cat-
egories: those without focal neurologic signs (e.g., metabolic and toxic 
encephalopathies); those with prominent focal signs (e.g., stroke, cere-
bral hemorrhage); and meningitis syndromes, characterized by fever or 
stiff neck and an excess of cells in the spinal fluid (e.g., bacterial menin-
gitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, encephalitis). Causes of sudden coma 
include  drug  ingestion,  cerebral  hemorrhage,  trauma,  cardiac  arrest, 
epilepsy, and basilar artery occlusion. Coma that appears subacutely is 
usually related to a preexisting medical or neurologic problem or, less 
often, to secondary brain swelling surrounding a mass such as tumor 
or cerebral infarction.

The  diagnosis  of  coma  due  to  cerebrovascular  disease  can  be  dif-
ficult  (Chap.  426).  The  most  common  diseases  in  this  category  are  
(1) basal ganglia and thalamic hemorrhage (acute but not instantaneous 
onset,  vomiting,  headache,  hemiplegia,  and  characteristic  eye  signs); 
(2) pontine hemorrhage (sudden onset, pinpoint pupils, loss of reflex 
eye  movements  and  corneal  responses,  ocular  bobbing,  posturing, 
and hyperventilation); (3) cerebellar hemorrhage (occipital headache, 
vomiting,  gaze  paresis,  and  inability  to  stand  and  walk);  (4)  basilar 
artery thrombosis (neurologic prodrome or transient ischemic attack 
warning  spells,  diplopia,  dysarthria,  vomiting,  eye  movement  and 
corneal  response  abnormalities,  and  asymmetric  limb  paresis);  and

TABLE 28-1  Differential Diagnosis of Coma
1.  Diseases that cause no focal brainstem or lateralizing neurologic signs  

(CT scan is often normal)
a.  Intoxications: alcohol, sedative drugs, opiates, etc.
b.   Metabolic disturbances: anoxia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, 

hypercalcemia, diabetic acidosis, nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemia, 
hypoglycemia, uremia, hepatic coma, hypercarbia, Addisonian crisis, 
hypo- and hyperthyroid states, profound nutritional deficiency

c.   Severe systemic infections: pneumonia, septicemia, typhoid fever, malaria, 

Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome

d.  Shock from any cause
e.  Status epilepticus, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, postictal states
 Hyperperfusion syndromes including hypertensive encephalopathy, 
f. 
eclampsia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

g.  Severe hyperthermia, hypothermia
h.  Concussion
i.  Acute hydrocephalus

2.  Diseases that cause focal brainstem or lateralizing cerebral signs (CT scan is 

typically abnormal)
a.   Hemispheral hemorrhage (basal ganglionic, thalamic) or infarction (large 
middle cerebral artery territory) with secondary brainstem compression

b.  Brainstem infarction due to basilar artery thrombosis or embolism
c.  Brain abscess, subdural empyema
d.  Epidural and subdural hemorrhage, brain contusion
e.  Brain tumor with surrounding edema
f.  Cerebellar and pontine hemorrhage and infarction
g.  Widespread traumatic brain injury
h.  Metabolic coma (see above) in the setting of preexisting focal damage
3.  Diseases that cause meningeal irritation with or without fever, and with an 

excess of white blood cells or red blood cells in the CSF
a.   Subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous 

malformation, trauma

b.  Infectious meningitis and meningoencephalitis
c.  Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis
d.  Carcinomatous and lymphomatous meningitis

(5)  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  (precipitous  coma  after  sudden  severe 
headache and vomiting). The most common stroke, infarction in the 
territory of the middle cerebral artery, does not cause coma, but edema 
surrounding large infarctions may expand over several days and cause 
coma from mass effect.

The syndrome of acute hydrocephalus accompanies many intracra-
nial diseases, particularly subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is characterized 
by  headache  and  sometimes  vomiting  that  may  progress  quickly  to 
coma  with  extensor  posturing  of  the  limbs,  bilateral  Babinski  signs, 
small  unreactive  pupils,  and  impaired  oculocephalic  movements  in 
the vertical direction. At times, the coma may be featureless without 
lateralizing signs, although papilledema is often present.
 ■ BRAIN DEATH
Brain death is a state of irreversible cessation of all cerebral and brain-
stem function with preservation of cardiac activity and maintenance of 
respiratory and somatic function by artificial means. It is the only type 
of brain damage recognized as morally, ethically, and legally equivalent 
to death. Criteria have been advanced for the diagnosis of brain death, 
and it is essential to adhere to consensus standards as multiple studies 
have shown variability in local practice. Given the implications of the 
diagnosis,  clinicians  must  be  thorough  and  precise  in  determining 
brain death. It is advisable to delay clinical testing for at least 24 h if 
a cardiac arrest has caused brain death or if the inciting disease is not 
known. Some centers advocate a brief period of observation between 
two examiners’ tests during which the clinical signs of brain death are 
sustained.

Established  criteria  contain  two  essential  elements,  after  assuring 
that no confounding factors (e.g., hypothermia, drug intoxication) are 
present:  (1)  widespread  cortical  destruction  that  is  reflected  by  deep 
coma and unresponsiveness to all forms of stimulation; and (2) global 

brainstem damage as demonstrated by absent pupillary light reaction, 
absent  corneal  reflexes,  loss  of  oculovestibular  reflexes,  and  destruc-
tion  of  the  medulla,  manifested  by  complete  and  irreversible  apnea. 
Diabetes  insipidus  is  often  present  but  may  only  develop  hours  or 
days after the other clinical signs of brain death appear. The pupils are 
usually midsized but may be enlarged. Loss of deep tendon reflexes is 
not required because the spinal cord remains functional. Occasionally, 
other reflexes that originate from the spine may be present and should 
not preclude a diagnosis of brain death.

Demonstration  that  apnea  is  due  to  medullary  damage  requires 
that the Pco2 be high enough to stimulate respiration during a test of 
spontaneous breathing. Apnea testing can be done by the use of preox-
ygenation  with  100%  oxygen  prior  to  and  following  removal  of  the 
ventilator. CO2 tension increases ~0.3–0.4 kPa/min (2–3 mmHg/min) 
during  apnea.  Apnea  is  confirmed  if  no  respiratory  effort  has  been 
observed in the presence of a sufficiently elevated Pco2. The apnea test 
is usually stopped if there is cardiovascular instability and alternative 
means of testing can be employed.

An isoelectric EEG may be used as an optional confirmatory test for 
total cerebral damage. Radionuclide brain scanning, cerebral angiog-
raphy, or transcranial Doppler measurements may be used to demon-
strate the absence of blood flow when a confirmatory study is desired.
It  is  largely  accepted  in  Western  society  that  the  ventilator  can  be 
disconnected  from  a  brain-dead  patient  and  that  organ  donation  is 
subsequently  possible.  Good  communication  between  the  physician 
and the family is important with appropriate preparation of the family 
for brain death testing and diagnosis.

TREATMENT
Coma

The immediate goal in a comatose patient is prevention of further 
nervous  system  damage.  Hypotension,  hypoglycemia,  hypercalce-
mia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hyperthermia should be corrected 
rapidly.  Hyponatremia  should  be  corrected  slowly  to  avoid  injury 
from  osmotic  demyelination  (Chap.  307).  An  oropharyngeal  air-
way is adequate to keep the pharynx open in a drowsy patient who 
is  breathing  normally.  Tracheal  intubation  is  indicated  if  there  is 
apnea,  upper  airway  obstruction,  hypoventilation,  or  emesis,  or 
if  the  patient  is  at  risk  for  aspiration.  Mechanical  ventilation  is 
required if there is hypoventilation or a need to induce hypocapnia 
in  order  to  lower  ICP.  The  management  of  raised  ICP  is  dis-
cussed  in  Chap.  307.  IV  access  is  established  and  naloxone  and 
dextrose are administered if opioid overdose or hypoglycemia are 
possibilities; thiamine is given along with glucose to avoid provok-
ing Wernicke’s encephalopathy in malnourished patients. In cases 
of  suspected  ischemic  stroke  including  basilar  thrombosis  with 
brainstem ischemia, IV tissue plasminogen activator or mechanical 
embolectomy  is  often  used  after  cerebral  hemorrhage  has  been 
excluded  and  when  the  patient  presents  within  established  time 
windows for these interventions (Chap. 427). Physostigmine may 
awaken patients with anticholinergic-type drug overdose but should 
be used only with careful monitoring; many physicians believe that 
it should only be used to treat anticholinergic overdose–associated 
cardiac arrhythmias. The use of benzodiazepine antagonists offers 
some prospect of improvement after overdose; however, these drugs 
are not commonly used empirically in part due to their tendency to 
provoke seizures. Certain other toxic and drug-induced comas have 
specific treatments such as fomepizole for ethylene glycol ingestion.
Administration  of  hypotonic  IV  solutions  should  be  monitored 
carefully in any serious acute brain illness because of the potential for 
exacerbating brain swelling. Cervical spine injuries must not be over-
looked,  particularly  before  attempting  intubation  or  evaluation  of 
oculocephalic responses. Fever and meningismus indicate an urgent 
need  for  examination  of  the  CSF  to  diagnose  meningitis.  When-
ever acute bacterial meningitis is suspected, antibiotics including at 
least vancomycin and a third-generation cephalosporin are typically 
administered rapidly along with dexamethasone (see Chap. 138).

 ■ PROGNOSIS
Some  patients,  especially  children  and  young  adults,  may  have  omi-
nous  early  clinical  findings  such  as  abnormal  brainstem  reflexes  and 
yet  recover;  early  prognostication  outside  of  brain  death  therefore  is 
unwise.  Metabolic  comas  have  a  far  better  prognosis  than  traumatic 
ones.  Systems  for  estimating  prognosis  in  adults  should  be  taken  as 
approximations,  and  medical  judgments  must  be  tempered  by  factors 
such as age, underlying systemic disease, and general medical condition. 
In an attempt to collect prognostic information from large numbers of 
patients with head injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale was devised; it has 
predictive value in cases of brain trauma (see Chap. 443). For anoxic 
coma, clinical signs such as the pupillary and motor responses after 1 
day, 3 days, and 1 week have predictive value; however, some predic-
tion  rules  are  less  reliable  in  the  setting  of  therapeutic  hypothermia, 
and  therefore,  serial  examinations  and  multimodal  prognostication 
approaches are advised in this setting. For example, the absence of the 
cortical  responses  of  the  somatosensory  evoked  potentials  has  been 
shown  to  be  a  strong  indicator  of  poor  outcome  following  hypoxic 
injury.

The poor outcome of persistent vegetative and minimally conscious 
states has  already  been mentioned,  but reports of a  small  number of 
patients displaying cortical activation on functional MRI in response 
to salient stimuli have begun to alter the perception of such individ-
uals. In one series, about 10% of vegetative patients (mainly following 
traumatic brain injury) could activate their frontal or temporal lobes 
in response to requests by an examiner to imagine certain visuospatial 
tasks.  Another  series  demonstrated  that  up  to  15%  of  patients  with 
various forms of acute brain injury and absence of behavioral responses 
to motor commands showed EEG activation in response to these com-
mands. It is prudent to avoid generalizations from these findings, but 
the need for future studies of novel techniques to help communication 
and possibly recovery is needed.

29 Dementia

William W. Seeley, Gil D. Rabinovici,  
Bruce L. Miller

Dementia, a syndrome with many causes, affects nearly 6 million peo-
ple in the United States and results in a total annual health care cost 
in excess of $300 billion. Dementia is defined as an acquired deterio-
ration in cognitive abilities that impairs the successful performance of 
activities of daily living. Episodic memory, the ability to recall events 
specific  in  time  and  place,  is  the  cognitive  function  most  commonly 
lost; 10% of persons age >70 years and 20–40% of individuals age >85 
years have clinically identifiable memory loss. In addition to memory, 
dementia may erode other mental faculties, including language, visu-
ospatial,  praxis,  calculation,  judgment,  and  problem-solving  abilities.

Neuropsychiatric  and  social  deficits  also  arise  in  many  dementia 
syndromes, manifesting as depression, apathy, anxiety, hallucinations, 
delusions,  agitation,  insomnia,  sleep  disturbances,  compulsions,  or 
disinhibition.  The  clinical  course  may  be  slowly  progressive,  as  in 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD); static, as in anoxic encephalopathy; or may 
fluctuate  from  day  to  day  or  minute  to  minute,  as  in  dementia  with 
Lewy bodies (DLB). Most patients with AD, the most prevalent form 
of  dementia,  begin  with  episodic  memory  impairment,  but  in  other 
dementias,  such  as  frontotemporal  dementia  (FTD),  memory  loss  is 
not  typically  a  presenting  feature.  Focal  cerebral  disorders  are  dis-
cussed in Chap. 30 and illustrated in a video library in Chap. V2; 
detailed  discussions  of  AD  can  be  found  in  Chap.  431;  FTD  and 
related disorders in Chap. 432; vascular dementia in Chap. 433; DLB 
in  Chap.  434;  Huntington’s  disease  (HD)  in  Chap.  436;  and  prion 
diseases in Chap. 438.

FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE 
DEMENTIAS
Dementia syndromes result from the disruption of specific large-scale 
neuronal networks; the location and severity of synaptic and neuronal 
loss  combine  to  produce  the  clinical  features  (Chap.  30).  Behavior, 
mood, and attention are modulated by ascending noradrenergic, sero-
tonergic,  and  dopaminergic  pathways,  whereas  cholinergic  signaling 
is  critical  for  attention  and  memory  functions.  The  dementias  differ 
in  the  relative  neurotransmitter  deficit  profiles;  accordingly,  accurate 
diagnosis guides effective pharmacologic therapy.

AD typically begins in the entorhinal region of the medial temporal 
lobe,  spreads  to  the  hippocampus  and  other  limbic  structures,  and 
moves through the basal temporal areas and then into the lateral and 
posterior temporal and parietal neocortex, eventually causing a more 
widespread  degeneration.  Vascular  dementia  is  associated  with  focal 
damage  in  a  variable  patchwork  of  cortical  and  subcortical  regions 
or white matter tracts that disconnects nodes within distributed net-
works. In keeping with its anatomy, AD typically presents with episodic 
memory loss accompanied later by aphasia, executive dysfunction, or 
navigational problems. In contrast, dementias that begin in frontal or 
subcortical regions, such as FTD or HD, are less likely to begin with 
memory  problems  and  more  likely  to  present  with  difficulties  with 
judgment, mood, executive control, movement, and behavior.

Lesions of frontal-striatal1 pathways produce specific and predictable 
effects on behavior. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has connections 
with a central band of the caudate nucleus. Lesions of either the caudate 
or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, or their connecting white matter path-
ways, may result in executive dysfunction, manifesting as poor organiza-
tion and planning, decreased cognitive flexibility, and impaired working 
memory. The lateral orbital frontal cortex connects with the ventrome-
dial caudate, and lesions of this system cause impulsiveness, distractibil-
ity, and disinhibition. The anterior cingulate cortex and adjacent medial 
prefrontal  cortex  project  to  the  nucleus  accumbens,  and  interruption 
of  this  system  produces  apathy,  poverty  of  speech,  emotional  blunt-
ing,  or  even  akinetic  mutism.  All  corticostriatal  systems  also  include 
topographically organized projections through the globus pallidus and 
thalamus, and damage to these nodes can likewise reproduce the clinical 
syndrome associated with the corresponding cortical or striatal injuries. 
Involvement  of  brainstem  nuclei  and  cerebellar  structures  can  further 
contribute to cognitive, behavioral, and motor manifestations.

 ■ THE CAUSES OF DEMENTIA
The  single  strongest  risk  factor  for  dementia  is  increasing  age.  The 
prevalence of disabling memory loss increases with each decade over 
age 50 and is usually associated with the microscopic changes of AD 
at  autopsy.  Yet  some  centenarians  have  intact  memory  function  and 
no evidence of clinically significant dementia. Whether dementia is an 
inevitable consequence of normal human aging remains controversial 
although the prevalence increases with every decade of life.

The many causes of dementia are listed in Table 29-1. The frequency 
of each condition depends on the age group under study, access of the 
group to medical care, country of origin, and perhaps racial or ethnic 
background.  AD  is  the  most  common  cause  of  dementia  in  Western 
countries, accounting for more than half of all patients. Vascular dis-
ease is the second most frequent cause for dementia and is particularly 
common in elderly patients or populations with limited access to med-
ical care, where vascular risk factors are undertreated. Often, vascular 
brain  injury  is  mixed  with  neurodegenerative  disorders,  particularly 
AD, making it difficult, even for the neuropathologist, to estimate the 
contribution  of  cerebrovascular  disease  to  the  cognitive  disorder  in 
an  individual  patient.  Dementias  associated  with  Parkinson’s  disease 
(PD)  are  common  and  may  develop  years  after  onset  of  a  parkinso-
nian  disorder,  as  seen  with  PD-related  dementia  (PDD),  or  they  can 
occur concurrently with or preceding the motor syndrome, as in DLB. 

Limbic-predominant  aging-related  TDP-43  encephalopathy  (LATE) 
is  common  after  age  70  and  has  been  linked  to  declining  episodic 
memory function. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a unique 
disease found in individuals with a history of repetitive head impacts 
(e.g., professional athletes in collision or fighting sports, military veterans 
exposed  to  multiple  blasts),  presents  with  changes  in  cognition,  mood, 
behavior, or motor function. Mixed pathology is common, especially in 
older individuals. In patients under the age of 65, FTD rivals AD as the 
most common cause of dementia. Chronic intoxications, including those 
resulting from alcohol and prescription drugs, are an important and often 
treatable  cause  of  dementia.  Other  disorders  listed  in  Table  29-1  are 
uncommon but important because many are reversible. The classifica-
tion of dementing illnesses into reversible and irreversible disorders is a 
useful approach to differential diagnosis. When effective treatments for 
the neurodegenerative conditions emerge, this dichotomy will become 
obsolete.

In  a  study  of  1000  persons  attending  a  memory  disorders  clinic, 
19%  had  a  potentially  reversible  cause  of  the  cognitive  impairment 
and 23% had a potentially reversible concomitant condition that may 
have contributed to the patient’s impairment. The three most common 
potentially  reversible  diagnoses  were  depression,  normal  pressure 
hydrocephalus  (NPH),  and  alcohol  dependence;  medication  side 
effects  are  also  common  and  should  be  considered  in  every  patient 
(Table 29-1).

The term rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is applied to illnesses 
that  progress  from  initial  symptom  onset  to  dementia  within  a  year 
or  less;  confusional  states  related  to  toxic/metabolic  conditions  are 
excluded. Although the prion proteinopathy Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
(CJD) (Chap. 438) is the classic cause of a rapidly progressive demen-
tia,  especially  when  associated  with  myoclonus,  more  often  cases  of 
RPD  are  due  to  AD  or  another  neurodegenerative  disorder,  or  to  an 
autoimmune encephalitis.

Subtle cumulative decline in episodic memory is a common part of 
aging. This frustrating experience, often the source of jokes and humor, 
has  historically  been  referred  to  as  benign  forgetfulness  of  the  elderly. 
Benign  means  that  it  is  not  so  progressive  or  serious  that  it  impairs 
successful and productive daily functioning, although the distinction 
between benign and significant memory loss can be subtle. At age 85, 
the average person is able to learn and recall approximately one-half 
of the items (e.g., words on a list) that he or she could at age 18. The 
term subjective cognitive decline describes individuals who experience 
a subjective decline from their cognitive baseline but perform within 
normal limits for their age and educational attainment on formal neu-
ropsychological testing. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as 
a decline in cognition that is confirmed on objective cognitive testing 
but does not disrupt normal daily activities. MCI can be further subcat-
egorized based on the presenting complaints and deficits (e.g., amnes-
tic MCI, executive MCI). Factors that predict progression from MCI to 
an AD dementia include a prominent memory deficit, family history 
of  dementia,  presence  of  an  apolipoprotein  ε4  (Apo  ε4)  allele,  small 
hippocampal  volumes,  an  AD-like  signature  of  cortical  atrophy,  low 
cerebrospinal fluid Aβ and elevated tau, or evidence of brain amyloid 
and tau deposition on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

The  major  degenerative  dementias  include  AD,  DLB,  FTD  and 
related  disorders,  HD,  and  prion  diseases,  including  CJD.  All  are 
associated  with  the  abnormal  aggregation  of  a  specific  protein:  Aβ42 
and  tau  in  AD;  α-synuclein  in  DLB;  tau,  TAR  DNA-binding  protein 
of 43 kDa (TDP-43), or the FET family of proteins (fused in sarcoma 
[FUS], Ewing sarcoma [EWS], and TBP-associated factor 15 [TAF15]) 
in FTD; huntingtin in HD; and misfolded prion protein (PrPsc) in CJD 
(Table 29-2).

The risk of developing dementia in late-life is associated with expo-
sures and lifestyle factors that can operate across the life span. Modi-
fiable risk factors include low education, hearing loss, traumatic brain 
injury,  hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  obesity,  heavy  alcohol  use, 
smoking,  depression,  physical  inactivity,  and  air  pollution.  Improved 
management  of  midlife  vascular  risk  factors  has  been  credited  with 
a  decreasing  incidence  of  dementia  observed  in  North  America  and 
Western Europe.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Dementias

Three major issues should be kept at the forefront: (1) What is the 
clinical diagnosis? (2) What component of the dementia syndrome 
is treatable or reversible? (3) Can the physician help to alleviate the 
burden on caregivers? A broad overview of the approach to demen-
tia is shown in Table 29-3. The major degenerative dementias can 
usually be distinguished by the initial symptoms; neuropsycholog-
ical, neuropsychiatric, and neurologic findings; and neuroimaging 
features (Table 29-4). 

HISTORY
The history should concentrate on the onset, duration, and tempo 
of progression. An acute or subacute onset of confusion may be due 
to  delirium  (Chap.  27)  and  should  trigger  a  search  for  intoxica-
tion, infection, or metabolic derangement. An elderly person with 
slowly progressive memory loss over several years is likely to suffer 
from  AD.  Nearly  75%  of  patients  with  AD  begin  with  memory 
symptoms, but other early symptoms include anxiety or depression 
as  well  as  difficulty  managing  money,  driving,  shopping,  follow-
ing instructions, finding words, or navigating. Personality change, 
disinhibition,  and  weight  gain  or  compulsive  eating  suggest  FTD, 
not AD. FTD is also suggested by prominent apathy, compulsivity, 
loss of empathy for others, or progressive loss of speech fluency or  
single-word  comprehension  with  relative  sparing  of  memory  and 
visuospatial  abilities.  The  diagnosis  of  DLB  is  suggested  by  early 
visual hallucinations; parkinsonism; proneness to delirium or sen-
sitivity  to  psychoactive  medications;  rapid  eye  movement  (REM) 
behavior disorder (RBD; dramatic, sometimes violent, limb move-
ments  during  dreaming  [Chap.  31]);  or  Capgras  syndrome,  the 
delusion that a familiar person has been replaced by an impostor.

A history of stroke with irregular stepwise progression suggests 
vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is also commonly seen in the 
setting of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular dis-
ease, smoking, and diabetes. In patients suffering from cerebrovas-
cular disease, it can be difficult to determine whether the dementia 
is  due  to  AD,  vascular  disease,  or  a  mixture  of  the  two  because 
many of the risk factors for vascular dementia, including diabetes, 
high cholesterol, elevated homocysteine, and low exercise, are also 
risk factors for AD. Moreover, many patients with a major vascular 
contribution  to  their  dementia  lack  a  history  of  stepwise  decline. 
Rapid progression with motor rigidity and myoclonus suggests CJD 
(Chap.  438).  Seizures  may  indicate  strokes  or  neoplasm  but  also 
occur in AD, particularly early-age-of-onset AD. Gait disturbance 
is common in vascular dementia, PD/DLB, or NPH. A history of 
high-risk sexual behaviors or intravenous drug use should trigger a 
search for central nervous system (CNS) infection, especially HIV or 
syphilis. A history of recurrent head trauma could indicate chronic 

subdural hematoma, CTE, intracranial hypotension, or NPH. Sub-
acute onset of severe amnesia and psychosis with mesial temporal 
T2/fluid-attenuated  inversion  recovery  (FLAIR)  hyperintensities 
on  MRI  should  raise  concern  for  autoimmune  (paraneoplastic) 
encephalitis, sometimes in long-term smokers or other patients at 
risk for cancer. The spectrum of autoimmune etiologies producing

RPD  has  rapidly  expanded,  and  includes  antibodies  targeting 
leucine-rich  glioma-inactivated  1  (LGI1;  faciobrachial  dystonic 
seizures);  contactin-associated  protein-like  2  (Caspr2;  insom-
nia,  ataxia,  myotonia);  N-methyl-d-aspartate  (NMDA)-receptor   
(psychosis,  insomnia,  dyskinesias);  and  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- 
methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-receptor (limbic enceph-
alitis with relapses), among others (Chap. 94). Alcohol abuse creates 
risk  for  malnutrition  and  thiamine  deficiency.  Veganism,  bowel 
irradiation,  an  autoimmune  diathesis,  a  remote  history  of  gastric 
surgery,  and  chronic  therapy  with  histamine  H2-receptor  antag-
onists  for  dyspepsia  or  gastroesophageal  reflux  predispose  to  B12 
deficiency.  Certain  occupations,  such  as  working  in  a  battery  or 
chemical factory, might indicate heavy metal intoxication. Careful 
review of medication intake, especially for sedatives and analgesics, 
may  raise  the  issue  of  chronic  drug  intoxication.  An  autosomal 
dominant  family  history  is  found  in  HD  and  in  familial  forms  of 
AD, FTD, DLB, or prion disorders. A history of mood disorder, the 
recent death of a loved one, or depressive signs such as insomnia 
or weight loss, raise the possibility of depression-related cognitive 
impairment. 
PHYSICAL AND NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION
A  thorough  general  and  neurologic  examination  is  essential  to 
identify signs of nervous system involvement and search for clues 
suggesting a systemic disease that might be responsible for the cog-
nitive disorder. Typical AD spares motor systems until late in the 
course. In contrast, patients with FTD often develop axial rigidity, 
supranuclear gaze palsy, or a motor neuron disease reminiscent of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In DLB, the initial symptoms 
may  include  a  parkinsonian  syndrome  (resting  tremor,  cogwheel 
rigidity,  bradykinesia,  festinating  gait),  but  DLB  often  starts  with 
visual hallucinations or cognitive impairment, and symptoms refer-
able  to  the  lower  brainstem  (RBD,  gastrointestinal,  or  autonomic 
problems)  may  arise  years  or  even  decades  before  parkinsonism 
or  dementia.  Corticobasal  syndrome  (CBS)  features  asymmetric 
akinesia and rigidity, dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomena, 
pyramidal signs, and prefrontal deficits such as nonfluent aphasia 
with or without motor speech impairment, executive dysfunction, 
apraxia,  or  a  behavioral  disorder.  Progressive  supranuclear  palsy 
(PSP) is associated with unexplained falls, axial rigidity, dysphagia, 
and vertical gaze deficits. CJD is suggested by the presence of dif-
fuse rigidity, an akinetic mute state, and prominent, often startle-
sensitive, myoclonus.

Hemiparesis  or  other  focal  neurologic  deficits  suggest  vascu-
lar  dementia  or  brain  tumor.  Dementia  with  a  myelopathy  and 
peripheral  neuropathy  suggests  vitamin  B12  deficiency.  Peripheral 

neuropathy  could  also  indicate  another  vitamin  deficiency,  heavy 
metal intoxication, thyroid dysfunction, Lyme disease, or vasculitis. 
Dry cool skin, hair loss, and bradycardia suggest hypothyroidism. 
Fluctuating confusion associated with repetitive stereotyped move-
ments may indicate ongoing limbic, temporal, or frontal seizures. 
In  the  elderly,  hearing  impairment  or  visual  loss  may  produce 
confusion and disorientation misinterpreted as dementia. Profound 
bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in a younger patient with short 
stature or myopathy, however, should raise concern for a mitochon-
drial disorder. 
COGNITIVE AND NEUROPSYCHIATRIC EXAMINATION
Brief  screening  tools  such  as  the  Mini-Mental  State  Examination 
(MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), the Tablet 
Based  Cognitive  Assessment  Tool,  and  Cognistat  can  be  used  to 
capture  dementia  and  follow  progression.  None  of  these  tests  is 
highly  sensitive  to  early-stage  dementia  or  reliably  discriminates 
between dementia syndromes. The MMSE is a 30-point test of cog-
nitive function, with each correct answer being scored as 1 point. 
It  includes  tests  of:  orientation  (e.g.,  identify  season/date/month/
year/floor/hospital/town/state/country);  registration  (e.g.,  name 
and restate 3 objects); recall (e.g., remember the same three objects 
5 minutes later); and language (e.g., name pencil and watch; repeat 
“no ifs ands or buts”; follow a 3-step command; obey a written com-
mand;  and  write  a  sentence  and  copy  a  design).  In  most  patients 
with MCI and some with clinically apparent AD, bedside screening 
tests  may  be  normal,  and  a  more  challenging  and  comprehensive 
set of neuropsychological tests will be required. When the etiology 
for  the  dementia  syndrome  remains  in  doubt,  a  specially  tailored 
evaluation should be performed that includes tasks of working and 
episodic  memory,  executive  function,  language,  and  visuospatial 
and  perceptual  abilities.  In  AD,  the  early  deficits  involve  episodic 
memory, category generation (“name as many animals as you can in 
1 minute”), and visuoconstructive ability. Usually deficits in verbal 
or visual episodic memory are the first neuropsychological abnor-
malities detected, and tasks that require the patient to recall a long 
list of words or a series of pictures after a predetermined delay will 
demonstrate deficits in most patients. In FTD, the earliest deficits 
on cognitive testing involve executive control or language (speech 
or naming) functions, but some patients lack either finding despite 
profound  social-emotional  deficits.  PDD  or  DLB  patients  have 
more severe deficits in executive and visuospatial function but do 
better  on  episodic  memory  tasks  than  patients  with  AD.  Patients 
with  vascular  dementia  often  demonstrate  a  mixture  of  executive 
and visuospatial deficits, with prominent psychomotor slowing. In 
delirium,  the  most  prominent  deficits  involve  attention,  working

memory,  and  executive  function,  making  the  assessment  of  other 
cognitive domains challenging and often uninformative.

A  functional  assessment  should  also  be  performed  to  help  the 
physician determine the day-to-day impact of the disorder on the 
patient’s memory, community affairs, hobbies, judgment, dressing, 
and eating. Knowledge of the patient’s functional abilities will help 
the clinician and the family to organize a therapeutic approach.

Neuropsychiatric  assessment  is  important  for  diagnosis,  prog-
nosis,  and  treatment.  In  the  early  stages  of  AD,  mild  depressive 
features, social withdrawal, and irritability or anxiety are the most 
prominent  psychiatric  changes,  but  patients  often  maintain  core 
social graces into the middle or late stages, when delusions, agita-
tion, and sleep disturbance may emerge. In FTD, dramatic person-
ality  change  with  apathy,  overeating,  compulsions,  disinhibition, 
and loss of empathy are early and common. DLB is associated with 
visual hallucinations, delusions related to person or place identity, 
RBD, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Dramatic fluctuations occur 
not  only  in  cognition  but  also  in  arousal.  Vascular  dementia  can 
present  with  psychiatric  symptoms  such  as  depression,  anxiety, 
delusions, disinhibition, or apathy. 

LABORATORY TESTS
The  choice  of  laboratory  tests  in  the  evaluation  of  dementia  is 
complex  and  should  be  tailored  to  the  individual  patient.  The 
physician  must  take  measures  to  avoid  missing  a  reversible  or 
treatable cause, yet no single treatable etiology is common; thus a 
screen must use multiple tests, each of which has a low yield. Cost/
benefit ratios are difficult to assess, and many laboratory screening 
algorithms  for  dementia  discourage  multiple  tests.  Nevertheless, 
even a test with only a 1–2% positive rate is worth undertaking if 
the alternative is missing a treatable cause of dementia. Table 29-3 
lists  most  screening  tests  for  dementia.  The  American  Academy 
of  Neurology  recommends  the  routine  measurement  of  a  com-
plete  blood  count;  electrolytes;  glucose;  renal,  liver,  and  thyroid 
functions; a vitamin B12 level; and a structural neuroimaging study 
(MRI or CT).

Neuroimaging studies, especially MRI, help to rule out primary 
and  metastatic  neoplasms,  locate  areas  of  infarction  or  inflam-
mation,  detect  subdural  hematomas,  and  suggest  NPH  or  diffuse 
white matter disease. They also help to establish a regional pattern 
of atrophy. Support for the diagnosis of AD includes hippocampal 

atrophy  in  addition  to  posterior-predominant  cortical  atrophy   
(Fig.  29-1).  Focal  frontal,  insular,  and/or  anterior  temporal  atro-
phy suggests FTD (Chap. 432). DLB often features less prominent 
atrophy,  with  greater  involvement  of  the  amygdala  than  the  hip-
pocampus.  In  CJD,  magnetic  resonance  (MR)  diffusion-weighted 
imaging reveals restricted diffusion within the cortical ribbon and/
or basal ganglia in most patients. Extensive multifocal white matter 
abnormalities  suggest  a  vascular  etiology  (Fig.  29-2).  Communi-
cating  hydrocephalus  with  vertex  effacement  (crowding  of  dorsal 
convexity gyri/sulci), gaping Sylvian fissures despite minimal cor-
tical  atrophy,  and  additional  features  shown  in  Fig.  29-3  suggest 
NPH. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and 
fluoro-deoxyglucose PET scanning show temporal-parietal hypop-
erfusion or hypometabolism in AD and frontotemporal deficits in 
FTD, but abnormalities in these patterns can be detected with MRI 
alone  in  many  patients.  Recently,  amyloid-  and  tau-PET  imaging 
have shown promise for the diagnosis of AD. There are currently

inversion 
recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance image through the lateral ventricles reveals 
multiple areas of hyperintensity (arrows) involving the periventricular white matter 
as well as the corona radiata and striatum. Although seen in some individuals with 
normal cognition, this appearance is more pronounced in patients with dementia of 
a vascular etiology.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Vascular  dementia  (Chap.  433)  is  more  common  in  Asia  due  to  the 
higher  prevalence  of  intracranial  atherosclerosis.  Rates  of  vascular 
dementia are also on the rise in developing countries as vascular risk 
factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mel-
litus  become  more  widespread.  CNS  infections,  HIV  (and  associated 
opportunistic  infections),  syphilis,  cysticercosis,  and  tuberculosis, 
likewise  represent  major  contributors  to  dementia  in  the  developing 
world.  Systemic  infection  with  SARS-CoV-2  may,  in  some  individ-
uals,  have  lasting  effects  on  cognition  due  to  involvement  of  brain 
microvasculature or to immunologically mediated white matter injury 
(acute  disseminated  encephalomyelitis  [ADEM])  (Chap.  444).  Some 
individuals complain of lasting fatigue, changes in mood, and cogni-
tive difficulties, but the long-term prognosis for SARS-CoV-2-related 
cognitive  impairment  remains  unknown.  Isolated  populations  have 
also contributed to our understanding of neurodegenerative dementia. 
Kuru, the cannibalism-associated rapidly progressive dementia seen in 
tribal New Guinea, played a role in the discovery of human prion dis-
ease.  Amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis-parkinsonism-dementia  complex 
of Guam (or, Lytico-bodig disease) is a poly-proteinopathy, often with 
tau,  TDP-43,  and  alpha-synuclein  aggregation.  The  root  cause  of  the 
disease remains uncertain, but its incidence has declined sharply over 
the past 60 years.

TREATMENT
Dementia

The  major  goals  of  dementia  management  are  to  treat  reversible 
causes and provide comfort and support to the patient and caregiv-
ers.  Treatment  of  underlying  causes  includes  thyroid  replacement 
for hypothyroidism; vitamin therapy for thiamine or B12 deficiency 
or  for  elevated  serum  homocysteine;  antimicrobials  for  opportu-
nistic infections or antiretrovirals for HIV; ventricular shunting for 
NPH; or surgical, radiation, and/or chemotherapeutic treatment for 
CNS neoplasms. Removal of cognition-impairing drugs or medica-
tions is essential when appropriate. If the patient’s cognitive com-
plaints stem from a psychiatric disorder, vigorous treatment of the 
condition  should  be  tried  to  eliminate  the  cognitive  complaint  or 
to confirm that it persists despite adequate resolution of the mood 
or anxiety symptoms. Patients with degenerative diseases may also 
be depressed or anxious, and those aspects of their condition often 
respond  to  therapy  while  not  necessarily  improving  cognition. 
Antidepressants,  such  as  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors 
(SSRIs)  or  serotonin-norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors  (SNRIs) 
(Chap. 452), which feature anxiolytic properties but few cognitive 
side  effects,  provide  the  mainstay  of  treatment  when  necessary. 
Anticonvulsants are used to control AD-associated seizures.

Agitation, hallucinations, delusions, and confusion are difficult 
to  treat.  These  behavioral  problems  represent  major  causes  for 
nursing  home  placement  and  institutionalization.  Before  treating 
these behaviors with medications, the clinician should aggressively 
seek  out  modifiable  environmental  or  metabolic  factors.  Hunger, 
lack  of  exercise,  toothache,  constipation,  urinary  tract  or  respira-
tory infection, electrolyte imbalance, and drug toxicity all represent 
easily  correctable  causes  that  can  be  remedied  without  psycho-
active  drugs.  Drugs  such  as  phenothiazines  and  benzodiazepines 
may  ameliorate  the  behavior  problems  but  have  untoward  side 
effects  such  as  sedation,  rigidity,  or  dyskinesia;  benzodiazepines 
can  occasionally  produce  paradoxical  disinhibition.  Despite  their 
unfavorable  side  effect  profile,  second-generation  antipsychotics 
such  as  quetiapine  (starting  dose,  12.5–25  mg  daily)  can  be  used 
for patients with agitation, aggression, and psychosis, although the 
risk profile for these compounds is significant, including increased 
mortality in patients with dementia. When patients do not respond 
to treatment, it is usually a mistake to advance to higher doses or 
to  use  anticholinergic  drugs  (like  diphenhydramine)  or  sedatives 
(such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines). It is important to recog-
nize and treat depression; treatment can begin with a low dose of an

three  amyloid  PET  ligands  (F18-florbetapir,  F18-florbetaben, 
F18-flutametamol)  and  one  tau  PET  ligand  (F18-flortaucipir) 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use. 
Amyloid PET ligands bind to diffuse and neuritic amyloid plaques, 
as well as to vascular amyloid deposits (prominent in cerebral amy-
loid angiopathy), while tau PET ligands bind to the paired helical 
filaments  of  tau  characteristic  of  neurofibrillary  tangles  in  AD 
(Chap. 431). Because amyloid plaques are also commonly found in 
cognitively normal older persons (~25% of individuals at age 65), 
the main clinical value of amyloid imaging is to exclude AD as the 
likely cause of dementia in patients who have negative scans. The 
spread of tau is more tightly linked to cognitive state (Chap. 431), 
and thus may be more useful than amyloid imaging for “ruling in” 
AD, as well as for disease staging. Once disease-modifying therapies 
become available, CSF or molecular PET biomarkers will likely be 
used to identify treatment candidates. In the meantime, the prog-
nostic  value  of  detecting  brain  amyloid  in  an  asymptomatic  elder 
to  assess  preclinical  disease  and  risk  of  future  cognitive  decline 
remains a topic of vigorous investigation.

Lumbar puncture need not be done routinely in the evaluation of 
dementia, but it is indicated when CNS infection or inflammation 
are credible diagnostic possibilities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels 
of  Aβ42  and  tau  proteins  show  differing  patterns  with  the  various 
dementias, and the presence of low Aβ42 (or a low Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), 
mild-moderately  elevated  CSF  total  tau,  and  elevated  CSF  phos-
phorylated tau (at residues 181 or 217) is highly suggestive of AD. 
Novel fully automated CSF Aβ and tau assays perform comparably 
to  amyloid  and  tau  PET  respectively,  though,  as  with  PET,  their 
routine  use  in  the  diagnosis  of  dementia  is  debated.  Blood-based 
biomarkers for AD show promise as a less invasive screening tool 
but remain under development (Chap. 431). Formal psychometric 
testing  helps  to  document  the  severity  of  cognitive  disturbance, 
suggests psychogenic causes, and provides a more formal method 
for  following  the  disease  course.  Electroencephalogram  (EEG)  is 
not  routinely  used  but  can  help  to  suggest  CJD  (repetitive  bursts 
of  diffuse  high-amplitude  sharp  waves,  or  “periodic  complexes”) 
or an underlying nonconvulsive seizure disorder (epileptiform dis-
charges). Brain biopsy (including meninges) is not advised except 
to diagnose vasculitis, neoplasms, or unusual infections when the 
diagnosis  is  uncertain.  Systemic  disorders  with  CNS  manifesta-
tions, such as sarcoidosis, can often be confirmed through biopsy 
of lymph node or solid organ rather than brain. MR angiography 
should  be  considered  when  cerebral  vasculitis  or  cerebral  venous 
thrombosis is a possible cause of the dementia.

daily) while monitoring for efficacy and toxicity. Sometimes apathy, 
visual hallucinations, depression, and other psychiatric symptoms 
respond  to  cholinesterase  inhibitors,  especially  in  DLB,  obviating 
the need for other more toxic therapies.

Cholinesterase inhibitors are being used to treat AD (donepezil, 
rivastigmine, galantamine) and PDD (rivastigmine). Memantine is 
useful for some patients with moderate to severe AD; its major ben-
efit relates to decreasing caregiver burden, most likely by decreasing 
resistance to dressing and grooming support. In moderate to severe 
AD, the combination of memantine and a cholinesterase inhibitor 
delayed nursing home placement in several studies, although other 
studies  have  not  supported  the  efficacy  of  adding  memantine  to 
the regimen. Memantine should be used with great caution, or not 
at all, in patients with DLB, due to risk of worsening agitation and 
confusion.  Therapies  targeting  the  production,  aggregation,  and 
spread  of  misfolded  proteins  associated  with  dementia  are  under 
development. Recently the first drug in this class, the amyloid-beta 
targeting monoclonal antibody aducanumab, was approved by the 
United States Food & Drug Administration for treatment of Alzhei-
mer’s disease (Chap. 431). Other drugs under development target 
disease-associated neuroinflammation metabolic changes, synaptic 
loss, and neurotransmitter changes.

Proactive approaches reduce the occurrence of delirium in hos-
pitalized  patients.  Frequent  orientation,  cognitive  activities,  sleep- 
enhancement measures, vision and hearing aids, and correction of 
dehydration are all valuable in decreasing the likelihood of delirium.
Nondrug behavior therapy has an important place in dementia 
management. The primary goals are to make the patient’s life com-
fortable, uncomplicated, and safe. Preparing lists, schedules, calen-
dars, and labels can be helpful in the early stages. It is also useful 
to stress familiar routines, walks, and simple physical exercises. For 
many  demented  patients,  memory  for  events  is  worse  than  their 
ability  to  carry  out  routine  activities,  and  they  may  still  be  able 
to  take  part  in  their  favorite  hobbies,  sports,  and  social  activities. 
Demented  patients  often  object  to  losing  control  over  familiar 
tasks such as driving, cooking, and handling finances. Attempts to 
help may be greeted with complaints, depression, or anger. Hostile 
responses  on  the  part  of  the  caregiver  are  counterproductive  and 
sometimes even harmful. Reassurance, distraction, and calm pos-
itive  statements  are  more  productive  when  resistance  is  present. 
Eventually, tasks such as finances and driving must be assumed by 
others, and the patient will conform and adjust. Safety is an impor-
tant issue that includes not only driving but controlling the kitchen, 
bathroom,  and  sleeping  area  environments,  as  well  as  stairways. 
These areas need to be monitored, supervised, and made as safe as 
possible.  A  move  to  a  retirement  complex,  assisted-living  center, 
or  nursing  home  can  initially  increase  confusion  and  agitation. 
Repeated reassurance, reorientation, and careful introduction to the 
new personnel will help to smooth the process. Providing activities 
that are known to be enjoyable to the patient can also help.

The  clinician  must  pay  special  attention  to  frustration  and 
depression among family members and caregivers. Caregiver guilt 
and burnout are common. Family members often feel overwhelmed 
and  helpless  and  may  vent  their  frustrations  on  the  patient,  each 
other, and health care providers. Caregivers should be encouraged 
to  take  advantage  of  day-care  facilities  and  respite  services.  Edu-
cation  and  counseling  about  dementia  are  important.  Local  and 
national support groups, such as the Alzheimer’s Association (www.
alz.org), can provide considerable help.

30 Aphasia, Memory Loss,  
and Other Cognitive 
Disorders
M.-Marsel Mesulam

The cerebral cortex of the human brain contains ~20 billion neurons 
spread over an area of 2.5 m2. The primary sensory and motor areas 
constitute 10% of the cerebral cortex. The rest is subsumed by modality- 
selective, heteromodal, paralimbic, and limbic areas collectively known 
as the association cortex (Fig. 30-1). The association cortex mediates 
the integrative processes that subserve cognition, emotion, and com-
portment. A systematic testing of these mental functions is necessary 
for  the  effective  clinical  assessment  of  the  association  cortex  and 
its  diseases.  According  to  current  thinking,  there  are  no  centers  for 
“hearing words,” “perceiving space,” or “storing memories.” Cognitive

and  behavioral  functions  (domains)  are  coordinated  by  intersecting 
large-scale  neural  networks  that  contain  interconnected  cortical  and 
subcortical components. Five anatomically defined large-scale networks 
are  most  relevant  to  clinical  practice:  (1)  a  left-dominant  perisylvian 
network for language, (2) a right-dominant parietofrontal network for 
spatial orientation, (3) an occipitotemporal network for face and object 
recognition, (4) a limbic network for episodic memory and emotional 
modulation,  and  (5)  a  prefrontal  network  for  the  executive  control 
of  cognition  and  comportment.  Investigations  based  on  functional 
imaging have also identified a default mode network, which becomes 
activated when the person is not engaged in a specific task requiring 
attention  to  external  events.  The  clinical  consequences  of  damage  to 
this network are not yet fully defined.

THE LEFT PERISYLVIAN NETWORK FOR 
LANGUAGE AND APHASIAS
The production and comprehension of words and sentences is depen-
dent on the integrity of a distributed network located along the perisyl-
vian region of the language-dominant (usually left) hemisphere. One 
hub,  situated  in  the  inferior  frontal  gyrus,  is  known  as  Broca’s  area. 
Damage to this region impairs fluency of verbal output and the gram-
matical  structure  of  sentences.  The  location  of  a  second  hub,  critical 
for language comprehension, is less clearly settled. Accounts of patients 
with focal cerebrovascular lesions identified Wernicke’s area, located at 
the parietotemporal junction, as a critical hub for word and sentence 
comprehension. Occlusive or embolic strokes involving this area inter-
fere with the ability to understand spoken or written language as well 
as the ability to express thoughts through meaningful words and state-
ments. However, investigations of patients with the neurodegenerative 
syndrome of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) have shown that sen-
tence comprehension is a widely distributed faculty jointly subserved 
by  Broca’s  and  Wernicke’s  areas,  and  that  the  areas  critical  for  word 
comprehension are more closely associated with the anterior temporal 
lobe than with Wernicke’s area. All components of the language net-
work are interconnected with each other and with surrounding parts 
of  the  frontal,  parietal,  and  temporal  lobes.  Damage  to  this  network 
gives rise to language impairments known as aphasia. Aphasia should 
be diagnosed only when there are deficits in the formal aspects of lan-
guage, such as word finding, word choice, comprehension, spelling, or 
grammar. Dysarthria, apraxia of speech, and mutism do not by them-
selves lead to a diagnosis of aphasia. In ~90% of right-handers and 60% 
of left-handers, aphasia occurs only after lesions of the left hemisphere.
 ■ CLINICAL EXAMINATION
The  clinical  examination  of  language  should  include  the  assessment 
of  naming,  spontaneous  speech,  comprehension,  repetition,  reading, 
and writing. A deficit of naming (anomia) is the single most common 
finding in aphasic patients. When asked to name a common object, the 
patient may fail to come up with the appropriate word, may provide a 
circumlocutious description of the object (“the thing for writing”), or 
may come up with the wrong word (paraphasia). If the patient offers 

an  incorrect  but  related  word  (“pen”  for  “pencil”),  the  naming  error 
is known as a semantic paraphasia; if the word approximates the cor-
rect answer but is phonetically inaccurate (“plentil” for “pencil”), it is 
known as a phonemic paraphasia. In most anomias, the patient cannot 
retrieve the appropriate name when shown an object but can point to 
the  appropriate  object  when  the  name  is  provided  by  the  examiner. 
This  is  known  as  a  one-way  (or  retrieval-based)  naming  deficit.  A 
two-way  (comprehension-based  or  semantic)  naming  deficit  exists 
if  the  patient  can  neither  provide  nor  recognize  the  correct  name. 
Spontaneous speech is described as “fluent” if it maintains appropriate 
output  volume,  phrase  length,  and  melody  or  as  “nonfluent”  if  it  is 
sparse and halting and average utterance length is below four words. 
The examiner also should note the integrity of grammar as manifested 
by word order (syntax), tenses, suffixes, prefixes, plurals, and posses-
sives. Comprehension can be tested by assessing the patient’s ability to 
follow conversation, asking yes-no questions (“Can a dog fly?” “Does it 
snow in summer?”), asking the patient to point to appropriate objects 
(“Where  is  the  source  of  illumination  in  this  room?”),  or  asking  for 
verbal definitions of single words. Repetition is assessed by asking the 
patient to repeat single words, short sentences, or strings of words such 
as “No ifs, ands, or buts.” The testing of repetition with tongue twisters 
such  as  “hippopotamus”  and  “Irish  constabulary”  provides  a  better 
assessment  of  dysarthria  and  apraxia  of  speech  than  of  aphasia.  It  is 
important to make sure that the number of words does not exceed the 
patient’s attention span. Otherwise, the failure of repetition becomes a 
reflection of the narrowed attention span (auditory working memory) 
rather than an indication of an aphasic deficit caused by dysfunction 
of a hypothetical phonological loop in the language network. Reading 
should be assessed for deficits in reading aloud as well as comprehen-
sion. Alexia describes an inability to either read aloud or comprehend 
written  words  and  sentences;  agraphia  (or  dysgraphia)  is  used  to 
describe an acquired deficit in spelling.

Aphasias  can  arise  acutely  in  cerebrovascular  accidents  (CVAs)  or 
gradually  in  neurodegenerative  diseases.  In  CVAs,  damage  encom-
passes  cerebral  cortex  as  well  as  deep  white  matter  pathways  inter-
connecting otherwise unaffected cortical areas. The syndromes listed 
in  Table  30-1  are  most  applicable  to  this  group,  where  gray  matter 
and white matter at the lesion site are abruptly and jointly destroyed. 
Progressive neurodegenerative diseases can have cellular, laminar, and 
regional specificity for the cerebral cortex, giving rise to a different set 
of aphasias that will be described separately.

Wernicke’s Aphasia  Comprehension  is  impaired  for  spoken  and 
written words and sentences. Language output is fluent but is highly 
paraphasic and circumlocutious. Paraphasic errors may lead to strings 
of neologisms, which lead to “jargon aphasia.” Speech contains few sub-
stantive nouns. The output is therefore voluminous but uninformative. 
For example, a patient attempts to describe how his wife accidentally 
threw  away  something  important,  perhaps  his  dentures:  “We  don’t 
need it anymore, she says. And with it when that was downstairs was 
my teeth-tick … a … den … dentith … my dentist. And they happened

visit some friends of hers and she can’t throw them away.”

Gestures  and  pantomime  do  not  improve  communication.  The 
patient  may  not  realize  that  his  or  her  language  is  incomprehensible 
and  may  appear  angry  and  impatient  when  the  examiner  fails  to 
decipher  the  meaning  of  a  severely  paraphasic  statement.  In  some 
patients,  this  type  of  aphasia  can  be  associated  with  severe  agitation 
and  paranoia.  The  ability  to  follow  commands  aimed  at  axial  mus-
culature  may  be  preserved.  The  dissociation  between  the  failure  to 
understand simple questions (“What is your name?”) in a patient who 
rapidly closes his or her eyes, sits up, or rolls over when asked to do so 
is  characteristic  of  Wernicke’s  aphasia  and  helps  differentiate  it  from 
deafness, psychiatric disease, or malingering. Patients with Wernicke’s 
aphasia  cannot  express  their  thoughts  in  meaning-appropriate  words 
and  cannot  decode  the  meaning  of  words  in  any  modality  of  input. 
This aphasia therefore has expressive as well as receptive components. 
Repetition, naming, reading, and writing also are impaired.

The lesion site most commonly associated with Wernicke’s aphasia 
caused  by  CVAs  is  the  posterior  portion  of  the  language  network. 
An  embolus  to  the  inferior  division  of  the  middle  cerebral  artery 
(MCA),  to  the  posterior  temporal  or  angular  branches  in  particular, 
is the most common etiology (Chap. 426). Intracerebral hemorrhage, 
head trauma, and neoplasm are other causes of Wernicke’s aphasia. A 
coexisting  right  hemianopia  or  superior  quadrantanopia  is  common, 
and mild right nasolabial flattening may be found, but otherwise, the 
examination is often unrevealing. The paraphasic, neologistic speech in 
an agitated patient with an otherwise unremarkable neurologic exami-
nation may lead to the suspicion of a primary psychiatric disorder such 
as schizophrenia or mania, but the other components characteristic of 
acquired aphasia and the absence of prior psychiatric disease usually 
settle the issue. Prognosis for recovery of language function is guarded.

Broca’s Aphasia  Speech is nonfluent, labored, interrupted by many 
word-finding  pauses,  and  usually  dysarthric.  It  is  impoverished  in 
function words but enriched in meaning-appropriate nouns. Abnormal 
word  order  and  the  inappropriate  deployment  of  bound  morphemes 
(word endings used to denote tenses, possessives, or plurals) lead to a 
characteristic agrammatism. Speech is telegraphic and pithy but quite 
informative.  In  the  following  passage,  a  patient  with  Broca’s  aphasia 
describes  his  medical  history:  “I  see  …  the  dotor,  dotor  sent  me  … 
Bosson. Go to hospital. Dotor … kept me beside. Two, tee days, doctor 
send me home.”

Output may be reduced to a grunt or single word (“yes” or “no”), 
which  is  emitted  with  different  intonations  in  an  attempt  to  express 
approval or disapproval. In addition to fluency, naming and repetition 
are  impaired.  Comprehension  of  spoken  language  is  intact  except 
for  syntactically  difficult  sentences  with  a  passive  voice  structure 
or  embedded  clauses,  indicating  that  Broca’s  aphasia  is  not  just  an 
“expressive” or “motor” disorder and that it also may involve a compre-
hension deficit in decoding syntax. Patients with Broca’s aphasia can be 
tearful, easily frustrated, and profoundly depressed. Insight into their 
condition is preserved, in contrast to Wernicke’s aphasia. Even when 
spontaneous speech is severely dysarthric, the patient may be able to 
display  a  relatively  normal  articulation  of  words  when  singing.  This 
dissociation has been used to develop specific therapeutic approaches 
(melodic intonation therapy) for Broca’s aphasia. Additional neurologic 
deficits include right facial weakness, hemiparesis or hemiplegia, and 
a buccofacial apraxia characterized by an inability to carry out motor 
commands  involving  oropharyngeal  and  facial  musculature  (e.g., 
patients are unable to demonstrate how to blow out a match or suck 
through a straw). The cause is most often infarction of Broca’s area (the 
inferior frontal convolution; “B” in Fig. 30-1) and surrounding anterior 
perisylvian and insular cortex due to occlusion of the superior division 
of the MCA (Chap. 426). Mass lesions, including tumor, intracerebral 
hemorrhage, and abscess, also may be responsible. When the cause of 
Broca’s aphasia is stroke, recovery of language function generally peaks 
within 2–6 months, after which time further progress is limited. Speech 
therapy is more successful than in Wernicke’s aphasia.

Conduction Aphasia  Speech  output  is  fluent  but  contains  many 
phonemic  paraphasias,  comprehension  of  spoken  language  is  intact, 
and repetition is severely impaired. Naming elicits phonemic parapha-
sias, and spelling is impaired. Reading aloud is impaired, but reading 
comprehension is preserved. The responsible lesion, usually a CVA in 
the  temporoparietal  or  dorsal  perisylvian  region,  interferes  with  the 
function  of  the  phonological  loop  interconnecting  Broca’s  area  with 
Wernicke’s area. Occasionally, a transient Wernicke’s aphasia may rap-
idly resolve into a conduction aphasia. The paraphasic and circumlocu-
tious output in conduction aphasia interferes with the ability to express 
meaning, but this deficit is not nearly as severe as the one displayed by 
patients with Wernicke’s aphasia. Associated neurologic signs in con-
duction aphasia vary according to the primary lesion site.
Transcortical  Aphasias:  Fluent  and  Nonfluent  Clinical  fea-
tures of fluent (posterior) transcortical aphasia are similar to those of 
Wernicke’s aphasia, but repetition is intact. The lesion site disconnects 
the  intact  core  of  the  language  network  from  other  temporoparietal 
association  areas.  Associated  neurologic  findings  may  include  hemi-
anopia.  Cerebrovascular  lesions  (e.g.,  infarctions  in  the  posterior 
watershed zone) and neoplasms that involve the temporoparietal cor-
tex  posterior  to  Wernicke’s  area  are  common  causes.  The  features  of 
nonfluent (anterior) transcortical aphasia are similar to those of Broca’s 
aphasia, but repetition is intact and agrammatism is less pronounced. 
The neurologic examination may be otherwise intact, but a right hemi-
paresis also can exist. The lesion site disconnects the intact language 
network  from  prefrontal  areas  of  the  brain  and  usually  involves  the 
anterior watershed zone between anterior and MCA territories or the 
supplementary  motor  cortex  in  the  territory  of  the  anterior  cerebral 
artery.
Global  and  Isolation  Aphasias  Global  aphasia  represents  the 
combined  dysfunction  of  Broca’s  and  Wernicke’s  areas  and  usually 
results  from  strokes  that  involve  the  entire  MCA  distribution  in  the 
left  hemisphere.  Speech  output  is  nonfluent,  and  comprehension  of 
language is severely impaired. Related signs include right hemiplegia, 
hemisensory  loss,  and  homonymous  hemianopia.  Isolation  aphasia 
represents  a  combination  of  the  two  transcortical  aphasias.  Compre-
hension is severely impaired, and there is no purposeful speech output. 
The patient may parrot fragments of heard conversations (echolalia), 
indicating that the neural mechanisms for repetition are at least par-
tially intact. This condition represents the pathologic function of the 
language network when it is isolated from other regions of the brain. 
Broca’s  and  Wernicke’s  areas  tend  to  be  spared,  but  there  is  damage 
to the surrounding frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex. Lesions are 
patchy and can be associated with anoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, 
or complete watershed zone infarctions.
Anomic  Aphasia  This  form  of  aphasia  may  be  considered  the 
“minimal  dysfunction”  syndrome  of  the  language  network.  Articu-
lation,  comprehension,  and  repetition  are  intact,  but  confrontation 
naming,  word  finding,  and  spelling  are  impaired.  Word-finding 
pauses  are  uncommon,  so  language  output  is  fluent  but  paraphasic, 
circumlocutious, and uninformative. The lesion sites can be anywhere 
within  the  left  hemisphere  language  network,  including  the  middle 
and inferior temporal gyri. Anomic aphasia is the single most common 
language  disturbance  seen  in  head  trauma,  metabolic  encephalopathy, 
and Alzheimer’s disease.
Pure Word Deafness  The most common causes are either bilat-
eral or left-sided MCA strokes affecting the superior temporal gyrus. 
The  net  effect  of  the  underlying  lesion  is  to  interrupt  the  flow  of 
information  from  the  auditory  association  cortex  to  the  language 
network.  Patients  have  no  difficulty  understanding  written  language 
and can express themselves well in spoken or written language. They 
have no difficulty interpreting and reacting to environmental sounds 
if  the  primary  auditory  cortex  and  auditory  association  areas  of  the 
right  hemisphere  are  spared.  Because  auditory  information  cannot 
be conveyed to the language network, however, it cannot be decoded 
into neural word representations, and the patient reacts to speech as if 
it were in an alien tongue that cannot be deciphered. Patients cannot

repeat spoken language but have no difficulty naming objects. In time, 
patients with pure word deafness teach themselves lipreading and may 
appear to have improved. There may be no additional neurologic find-
ings, but agitated paranoid reactions are common in the acute stages. 
Cerebrovascular lesions are the most common cause.

Pure Alexia Without Agraphia  This  is  the  visual  equivalent  of 
pure  word  deafness.  The  lesions  (usually  a  combination  of  damage 
to  the  left  occipital  cortex  and  to  a  posterior  sector  of  the  corpus 
callosum—the  splenium)  interrupt  the  flow  of  visual  input  into  the 
language  network.  There  is  usually  a  right  hemianopia,  but  the  core 
language network remains unaffected. The patient can understand and 
produce  spoken  language,  name  objects  in  the  left  visual  hemifield, 
repeat, and write. However, the patient acts as if illiterate when asked 
to  read  even  the  simplest  sentence  because  the  visual  information 
from the written words (presented to the intact left visual hemifield) 
cannot reach the language network. Objects in the left hemifield may 
be  named  accurately  because  they  activate  nonvisual  associations  in 
the right hemisphere, which in turn can access the language network 
through transcallosal pathways anterior to the splenium. Patients with 
this syndrome also may lose the ability to name colors, although they 
can match colors. This is known as a color anomia. The most common 
etiology of pure alexia is a vascular lesion in the territory of the poste-
rior cerebral artery or an infiltrating neoplasm in the left occipital cor-
tex that involves the optic radiations as well as the crossing fibers of the 
splenium.  Because  the  posterior  cerebral  artery  also  supplies  medial 
temporal components of the limbic system, a patient with pure alexia 
also may experience an amnesia, but this is usually transient because 
the limbic lesion is unilateral.

Apraxia and Aphemia  Apraxia designates a complex motor def-
icit that cannot be attributed to pyramidal, extrapyramidal, cerebellar, 
or  sensory  dysfunction  and  that  does  not  arise  from  the  patient’s 
failure to understand the nature of the task. Apraxia of speech is used 
to  designate  articulatory  abnormalities  in  the  duration,  fluidity,  and 
stress of syllables that make up words. It can arise with CVAs in the 
posterior part of Broca’s area or in the course of frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration  (FTLD)  with  tauopathy.  Aphemia  is  a  severe  form  of 
acute  speech  apraxia  that  presents  with  severely  impaired  fluency 
(often  mutism).  Recovery  is  the  rule  and  involves  an  intermediate 
stage of hoarse whispering. Writing, reading, and comprehension are 
intact,  and  so  this  is  not  a  true  aphasic  syndrome.  CVAs  in  parts  of 
Broca’s area or subcortical lesions that undercut its connections with 
other  parts  of  the  brain  may  be  present.  Occasionally,  the  lesion  site 
is on the medial aspects of the frontal lobes and may involve the sup-
plementary motor cortex of the left hemisphere. Ideomotor apraxia is 
diagnosed when commands to perform a specific motor act (“cough,” 
“blow out a match”) or pantomime the use of a common tool (a comb, 
hammer, straw, or toothbrush) in the absence of the real object cannot 
be followed. The patient’s ability to comprehend the command is ascer-
tained by demonstrating multiple movements and establishing that the 
correct one can be recognized. Some patients with this type of apraxia 
can imitate the appropriate movement when it is demonstrated by the 
examiner and show no impairment when handed the real object, indi-
cating that the sensorimotor mechanisms necessary for the movement 
are intact. Some forms of ideomotor apraxia represent a disconnection 
of the language network from pyramidal motor systems so that com-
mands to execute complex movements are understood but cannot be 
conveyed to the appropriate motor areas. Buccofacial apraxia involves 
apraxic deficits in movements of the face and mouth. Ideomotor limb 
apraxia  encompasses  apraxic  deficits  in  movements  of  the  arms  and 
legs. Ideomotor apraxia almost always is caused by lesions in the left 
hemisphere and is commonly associated with aphasic syndromes, espe-
cially Broca’s aphasia and conduction aphasia. Because the handling of 
real objects is not impaired, ideomotor apraxia by itself causes no major 
limitation of daily living activities. Patients with lesions of the anterior 
corpus  callosum  can  display  ideomotor  apraxia  confined  to  the  left 
side  of  the  body,  a  sign  known  as  sympathetic  dyspraxia.  A  severe 
form of sympathetic dyspraxia, known as the alien hand syndrome, is 

characterized by additional features of motor disinhibition on the left 
hand. Ideational apraxia refers to a deficit in the sequencing of goal-
directed movements in patients who have no difficulty executing the 
individual components of the sequence. For example, when the patient 
is asked to pick up a pen and write, the sequence of uncapping the pen, 
placing the cap at the opposite end, turning the point toward the writ-
ing surface, and writing may be disrupted, and the patient may be seen 
trying to write with the wrong end of the pen or even with the removed 
cap. These motor sequencing problems usually are seen in the context 
of confusional states and dementias rather than focal lesions associated 
with  aphasic  conditions.  Limb-kinetic  apraxia  involves  clumsiness  in 
the use of tools or objects that cannot be attributed to sensory, pyra-
midal,  extrapyramidal,  or  cerebellar  dysfunction.  This  condition  can 
emerge in the context of focal premotor cortex lesions or corticobasal 
degeneration and can interfere with the use of tools and utensils.

Gerstmann’s  Syndrome  The  combination  of  acalculia  (impair-
ment  of  simple  arithmetic),  dysgraphia  (impaired  writing),  finger 
anomia (an inability to name individual fingers such as the index and 
thumb),  and  right-left  confusion  (an  inability  to  tell  whether  a  hand, 
foot, or arm of the patient or examiner is on the right or left side of the 
body) is known as Gerstmann’s syndrome. In making this diagnosis, it 
is important to establish that the finger and left-right naming deficits 
are not part of a more generalized anomia and that the patient is not 
otherwise aphasic. When Gerstmann’s syndrome arises acutely and in 
isolation, it is commonly associated with damage to the inferior parie-
tal lobule (especially the angular gyrus) in the left hemisphere.

Pragmatics and Prosody  Pragmatics refers to aspects of language 
that communicate attitude, affect, and the figurative rather than literal 
aspects of a message (e.g., “green thumb” does not refer to the actual 
color  of  the  finger).  One  component  of  pragmatics,  prosody,  refers 
to  variations  of  melodic  stress  and  intonation  that  influence  attitude 
and  the  inferential  aspect  of  verbal  messages.  For  example,  the  two 
statements “He is clever.” and “He is clever?” contain an identical word 
choice and syntax but convey vastly different messages because of dif-
ferences in the intonation with which the statements are uttered. Dam-
age to right hemisphere regions corresponding to Broca’s area impairs 
the  ability  to  introduce  meaning-appropriate  prosody  into  spoken 
language.  The  patient  produces  grammatically  correct  language  with 
accurate  word  choice,  but  the  statements  are  uttered  in  a  monotone 
that interferes with the ability to convey the intended stress and effect. 
Patients  with  this  type  of  aprosodia  give  the  mistaken  impression  of 
being depressed or indifferent. Other aspects of pragmatics, especially 
the ability to infer the figurative aspect of a message, become impaired 
by damage to the right hemisphere or frontal lobes.

Subcortical  Aphasia  Damage  to  subcortical  components  of  the 
language  network  (e.g.,  the  striatum  and  thalamus  of  the  left  hemi-
sphere)  also  can  lead  to  aphasia.  The  resulting  syndromes  contain 
combinations of deficits in the various aspects of language but rarely fit 
the specific patterns described in Table 30-1. In a patient with a CVA, 
an anomic aphasia accompanied by dysarthria or a fluent aphasia with 
hemiparesis should raise the suspicion of a subcortical lesion site.

CLINICAL  PRESENTATION  AND  DIAGNOSIS  OF  PPA  Aphasias  caused 
by  CVAs  start  suddenly  and  display  maximal  deficits  at  the  onset. 
These  are  the  “classic”  aphasias  described  above.  Aphasias  caused  by 
neurodegenerative diseases have an insidious onset and relentless pro-
gression. The neuropathology can be selective not only for gray matter 
but also for specific layers and cell types. The clinico-anatomic patterns 
are therefore different from those described in Table 30-1.

Several  neurodegenerative  syndromes,  such  as  typical  Alzheimer-
type  (amnestic;  Chap.  431)  and  frontotemporal  (behavioral;  Chap. 
432) dementias, can also include language impairments as the disease 
progresses. In these cases, the aphasia is an ancillary component of the 
overall  syndrome.  A  diagnosis  of  primary  progressive  aphasia  (PPA) 
is justified only if the language disorder (i.e., aphasia) arises in relative 
isolation, becomes the primary concern that brings the patient to med-
ical attention, and remains the most salient deficit for 1–2 years. PPA

can be caused by either FTLD or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. 
Rarely, an identical syndrome can be caused by Creutzfeldt-Jacob dis-
ease (CJD) but with a more rapid progression (Chap. 438).
LANGUAGE IN PPA  The impairments of language in PPA have slightly 
different patterns from those seen in CVA-caused aphasias. For exam-
ple,  the  full  syndrome  of  Wernicke’s  aphasia  is  almost  never  seen  in 
PPA, confirming the view that sentence comprehension and word com-
prehension are controlled by different regions of the language network. 
Three major subtypes of PPA can be recognized.

Agrammatic  PPA  The  agrammatic  variant  is  characterized  by 
consistently  low  fluency  and  impaired  grammar  but  intact  word 
comprehension.  It  most  closely  resembles  Broca’s  aphasia  or  anterior 
transcortical  aphasia  but  usually  lacks  the  right  hemiparesis  or  dys-
arthria and may have more profound impairments of grammar. Peak 
sites  of  neuronal  loss  (gray  matter  atrophy)  include  the  left  inferior 
frontal  gyrus  where  Broca’s  area  is  located.  The  neuropathology  is 
usually a FTLD with tauopathy but can also be an atypical form of AD 
pathology.

Semantic PPA  The semantic variant is characterized by preserved 
fluency and syntax but poor single-word comprehension and profound 
two-way  naming  impairments.  This  kind  of  aphasia  is  not  seen  with 
CVAs.  It  differs  from  Wernicke’s  aphasia  or  posterior  transcortical 
aphasia because speech is usually informative and repetition is intact. 
Comprehension of sentences is relatively preserved if the meaning is 
not  too  dependent  on  words  that  fail  to  be  understood  allowing  the 
patient  to  surmise  the  gist  of  the  conversation  through  contextual 
cues.  Such  patients  may  appear  unimpaired  in  the  course  of  casual 
small talk but become puzzled upon encountering an undecipherable 
word such as “pumpkin” or “umbrella.” Peak atrophy sites are located 
in the left anterior temporal lobe, indicating that this part of the brain 
plays  a  critical  role  in  the  comprehension  of  words,  especially  words 
that denote concrete objects. This is a part of the brain that was not 
included  within  the  classic  language  network,  probably  because  it  is 
not a common site for focal CVAs. The neuropathology is frequently an 
FTLD with abnormal precipitates of the 43-kDa transactive response 
DNA-binding protein TDP-43 of type C.

Logopenic PPA  The logopenic variant is characterized by preserved 
syntax  and  comprehension  but  frequent  and  severe  word-finding 
pauses,  anomia,  circumlocutions,  and  simplifications  during  sponta-
neous  speech.  Repetition  is  usually  impaired.  Peak  atrophy  sites  are 
located in the temporoparietal junction and posterior temporal lobe, 
partially  overlapping  with  traditional  location  of  Wernicke’s  area. 
However,  the  comprehension  impairment  of  Wernicke’s  aphasia  is 
absent probably because the underlying deep white matter, frequently 
damaged  by  CVAs,  remains  relatively  intact  in  PPA.  The  repetition 
impairment suggests that parts of Wernicke’s area are critical for pho-
nological loop functionality. In contrast to Broca’s aphasia or agram-
matic PPA, the interruption of fluency is variable so that speech may 
appear entirely normal if the patient is allowed to engage in small talk. 
Logopenic PPA resembles the anomic aphasia of Table 30-1 but usually 
has longer and more frequent word-finding pauses. When repetition is 
impaired, the aphasia resembles the conduction aphasia in Table 30-1. 
Of all PPA subtypes, this is the one most commonly associated with the 
pathology of AD, but FTLD can also be the cause. In addition to these 
three major subtypes, there is also a mixed type of PPA where grammar, 
fluency,  and  word  comprehension  are  jointly  impaired.  This  is  most 
like  the  global  aphasia  of  Table  30-1.  Rarely,  PPA  can  present  with 
patterns reminiscent of pure word deafness or Gerstmann’s syndrome.

THE PARIETOFRONTAL NETWORK FOR 
SPATIAL ORIENTATION
Adaptive spatial orientation is subserved by a large-scale network con-
taining three major cortical components. The cingulate cortex provides 
access to a motivational mapping of the extrapersonal space, the poste-
rior parietal cortex to a sensorimotor representation of salient extraper-
sonal events, and the frontal eye fields to motor strategies for attentional 

FIGURE  30-2  Functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  of  language  and  spatial 
attention in neurologically intact subjects. The red and black areas show regions 
of task-related significant activation. (Top) The subjects were asked to determine if 
two words were synonymous. This language task led to the simultaneous activation 
of the two components of the language network, Broca’s area (B) and Wernicke’s 
area  (W).  The  activations  are  exclusively  in  the  left  hemisphere.  (Bottom)  The 
subjects were asked to shift spatial attention to a peripheral target. This task led 
to the simultaneous activation of the three epicenters of the attentional network: 
the posterior parietal cortex (P), the frontal eye fields (F), and the cingulate gyrus 
(CG). The activations are predominantly in the right hemisphere. (Courtesy of Darren 
Gitelman, MD.)

behaviors (Fig. 30-2). Subcortical components of this network include 
the striatum and the thalamus. Damage to this network can undermine 
the distribution of attention within the extrapersonal space, giving rise 
to  hemispatial  neglect,  simultanagnosia,  and  object  finding  failures. 
The integration of egocentric (self-centered) with allocentric (object-
centered) coordinates can also be disrupted, giving rise to impairments 
in route finding, the ability to avoid obstacles, and the ability to dress.

 ■ HEMISPATIAL NEGLECT
Contralesional  hemispatial  neglect  represents  one  outcome  of  dam-
age  to  the  cortical  or  subcortical  components  of  this  network.  The 
traditional view that hemispatial neglect always denotes a parietal lobe 
lesion is inaccurate. According to one model of spatial cognition, the 
right  hemisphere  directs  attention  within  the  entire  extrapersonal 
space, whereas the left hemisphere directs attention mostly within the 
contralateral  right  hemispace.  Consequently,  left  hemisphere  lesions 
do  not  give  rise  to  much  contralesional  neglect  because  the  global 
attentional  mechanisms  of  the  right  hemisphere  can  compensate  for 
the loss of the contralaterally directed attentional functions of the left 
hemisphere. Right hemisphere lesions, however, give rise to severe con-
tralesional  left  hemispatial  neglect  because  the  unaffected  left  hemi-
sphere does not contain ipsilateral attentional mechanisms. This model 
is consistent with clinical experience, which shows that contralesional 
neglect is more common, more severe, and longer lasting after dam-
age to the right hemisphere than after damage to the left hemisphere. 
Severe neglect for the right hemispace is rare, even in left-handers with 
left hemisphere lesions.

200 Clinical  Examination  Patients  with  severe  neglect  may  fail  to 
dress, shave, or groom the left side of the body; fail to eat food placed 
on the left side of the tray; and fail to read the left half of sentences. 
When  asked  to  copy  a  simple  line  drawing,  the  patient  fails  to  copy 
detail on the left, and when the patient is asked to write, there is a ten-
dency to leave an unusually wide margin on the left. Two bedside tests 
that are useful in assessing neglect are simultaneous bilateral stimula-
tion and visual target cancellation. In the former, the examiner provides 
either  unilateral  or  simultaneous  bilateral  stimulation  in  the  visual, 
auditory, and tactile modalities. After right hemisphere injury, patients 
who  have  no  difficulty  detecting  unilateral  stimuli  on  either  side 
experience the bilaterally presented stimulus as coming only from the 
right. This phenomenon is known as extinction and is a manifestation 
of  the  sensory-representational  aspect  of  hemispatial  neglect.  In  the 
target detection task, targets (e.g., A’s) are interspersed with foils (e.g., 
other letters of the alphabet) on a 21.5- to 28.0-cm (8.5–11 in.) sheet 

of paper, and the patient is asked to circle all the targets. A failure to 
detect targets on the left is a manifestation of the exploratory (motor) 
deficit in hemispatial neglect (Fig. 30-3A). Hemianopia is not by itself 
sufficient to cause the target detection failure because the patient is free 
to turn the head and eyes to the left. Target detection failures therefore 
reflect a distortion of spatial attention, not just of sensory input. Some 
patients with neglect also may deny the existence of hemiparesis and 
may even deny ownership of the paralyzed limb, a condition known as 
anosognosia.

 ■ BÁLINT’S SYNDROME, SIMULTANAGNOSIA, 
DRESSING APRAXIA, CONSTRUCTION APRAXIA, 
AND ROUTE-FINDING IMPAIRMENTS
Bilateral  involvement  of  the  network  for  spatial  attention,  especially 
its parietal components, leads to a state of severe spatial disorientation 
known as Bálint’s syndrome. Bálint’s syndrome involves deficits in the

manifestation of left hemispatial neglect. B. A 70-year-old woman with a 2-year history of degenerative dementia was able to circle most of the small targets but ignored the 
larger ones. This is a manifestation of simultanagnosia.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesorderly visuomotor scanning of the environment (oculomotor apraxia), 
accurate manual reaching toward visual targets (optic ataxia), and the 
ability to integrate visual information in the center of gaze with more 
peripheral  information  (simultanagnosia).  A  patient  with  simultana-
gnosia  “misses  the  forest  for  the  trees.”  For  example,  a  patient  who 
is  shown  a  table  lamp  and  asked  to  name  the  object  may  look  at  its 
circular base and call it an ashtray. Some patients with simultanagnosia 
report that objects they look at may vanish suddenly, probably indicat-
ing an inability to compute the oculomotor return to the original point 
of gaze after brief saccadic displacements. Movement and distracting 
stimuli greatly exacerbate the difficulties of visual perception. Simul-
tanagnosia  can  occur  without  the  other  two  components  of  Bálint’s 
syndrome, especially in association with AD.

A  modification  of  the  letter  cancellation  task  described  above  can 
be used for the bedside diagnosis of simultanagnosia. In this modifica-
tion, some of the targets (e.g., A’s) are made to be much larger than the 
others (7.5–10 cm vs 2.5 cm [3–4 in. vs 1 in.] in height), and all targets 
are  embedded  among  foils.  Patients  with  simultanagnosia  display  a 
counterintuitive but characteristic tendency to miss the larger targets 
(Fig.  30-3B).  This  occurs  because  the  information  needed  for  the 
identification of the larger targets cannot be confined to the immediate 
line of gaze and requires the integration of visual information across 
multiple fixation points. The greater difficulty in the detection of the 
larger targets also indicates that poor acuity is not responsible for the 
impairment of visual function and that the problem is central rather 
than peripheral. The test shown in Fig. 30-3B is not by itself sufficient 
to diagnose simultanagnosia as some patients with a frontal network 
syndrome may omit the letters that appear incongruous for the size of 
the paper. This may happen because they lack the mental flexibility to 
realize that the two types of targets are symbolically identical despite 
being superficially different.

Bilateral  parietal  lesions  can  impair  the  integration  of  egocentric 
with  allocentric  spatial  coordinates.  One  manifestation  is  dressing 
apraxia. A patient with this condition is unable to align the body axis 
with the axis of the garment and can be seen struggling as he or she 
holds a coat from its bottom or extends his or her arm into a fold of 
the garment rather than into its sleeve. Lesions that involve the pos-
terior parietal cortex also lead to severe difficulties in copying simple 
line  drawings.  This  is  known  as  a  construction  apraxia  and  is  much 
more severe if the lesion is in the right hemisphere. In some patients 
with right hemisphere lesions, the drawing difficulties are confined to 
the left side of the figure and represent a manifestation of hemispatial 
neglect; in others, there is a more universal deficit in reproducing con-
tours and three-dimensional perspective. Impairments of route finding 
can be included in this group of disorders, which reflect an inability to 
orient the self with respect to external objects and landmarks.

Causes of Spatial Disorientation and the Posterior Cortical 
Atrophy Syndrome  Cerebrovascular lesions and neoplasms in the 
right hemisphere are common causes of hemispatial neglect. Depend-
ing on the site of the lesion, a patient with neglect also may have hemi-
paresis, hemihypesthesia, and hemianopia on the left, but these are not 
invariant findings. The majority of these patients display considerable 
improvement  of  hemispatial  neglect,  usually  within  the  first  several 
weeks. Bálint’s syndrome, dressing apraxia, and route-finding impair-
ments  are  more  likely  to  result  from  bilateral  dorsal  parietal  lesions; 
common settings for acute onset include watershed infarction between 
the middle and posterior cerebral artery territories, hypoglycemia, and 
sagittal sinus thrombosis.

A progressive form of spatial disorientation, known as the posterior 
cortical atrophy (PCA) syndrome, most commonly represents a variant 
of  AD  with  unusual  concentrations  of  neurofibrillary  degeneration 
in the parieto-occipital cortex and the superior colliculus (Fig. 30-4). 
Lewy body disease (LBD), CJD, and FTLD (corticobasal degeneration 
type) are other possible causes. The patient displays progressive hemis-
patial neglect, Bálint’s syndrome, and route-finding impairments, usu-
ally accompanied by dressing and construction apraxia.

THE OCCIPITOTEMPORAL NETWORK FOR 
FACE AND OBJECT RECOGNITION
A patient with prosopagnosia cannot recognize familiar faces, includ-
ing, sometimes, the reflection of their own face in the mirror. This is 
not a perceptual deficit because prosopagnosic patients easily can tell 
whether two faces are identical. Furthermore, a prosopagnosic patient 
who cannot recognize a familiar face by visual inspection alone can use 
auditory  cues  to  reach  appropriate  recognition  if  allowed  to  listen  to 
the person’s voice. The deficit in prosopagnosia is therefore modality- 
specific and reflects the existence of a lesion that prevents the activa-
tion of otherwise intact multimodal associative templates by relevant 
visual  input.  Prosopagnosic  patients  characteristically  have  no  diffi-
culty with the generic identification of a face as a face or a car as a car, 
but may not recognize the identity of an individual face or the make of 
an individual car. This reflects a visual recognition deficit for propri-
etary features that characterize individual members of an object class. 
When recognition problems become more generalized and extend to 
the generic identification of common objects, the condition is known 
as visual object agnosia. A patient with anomia cannot name the object 
but  can  describe  its  use.  In  contrast,  a  patient  with  visual  agnosia  is 
unable  either  to  name  a  visually  presented  object  or  to  describe  its 
use.  Face  and  object  recognition  disorders  also  can  result  from  the 
simultanagnosia of Bálint’s syndrome, in which case they are known as 
apperceptive agnosias as opposed to the associative agnosias that result 
from inferior temporal lobe lesions.

 ■ CAUSES AND RELATION TO SEMANTIC 
DEMENTIA
The characteristic lesions in prosopagnosia and visual object agnosia 
of  acute  onset  consist  of  bilateral  infarctions  in  the  territory  of  the 
posterior cerebral arteries that involve the fusiform gyrus. Associated 
deficits can include visual field defects (especially superior quadrantan-
opias) and a centrally based color blindness known as achromatopsia. 
Rarely, the responsible lesion is unilateral. In such cases, prosopagnosia 
is associated with lesions in the right hemisphere, and object agnosia 
with lesions in the left. Degenerative diseases of anterior and inferior 
temporal  cortex  can  cause  progressive  associative  prosopagnosia  and 
object  agnosia.  The  combination  of  progressive  associative  agnosia 
and a fluent aphasia with word comprehension impairment is known 
as  semantic  dementia.  Patients  with  semantic  dementia  fail  to  recog-
nize  faces  and  objects  and  cannot  understand  the  meaning  of  words 
denoting  objects.  This  needs  to  be  differentiated  from  the  semantic 
type of PPA where there is severe impairment in understanding words 
that  denote  objects  and  in  naming  faces  and  objects  but  a  relative 
preservation of face and object recognition. The anterior temporal lobe 
atrophy  is  usually  bilateral  in  semantic  dementia  whereas  it  tends  to 
affect mostly the left hemisphere in semantic PPA. Acute onset of the 
semantic  dementia  syndrome  can  be  associated  with  herpes  simplex 
encephalitis.

LIMBIC NETWORK FOR EXPLICIT MEMORY 
AND AMNESIA
Limbic  areas  (e.g.,  the  hippocampus,  amygdala,  and  entorhinal  cor-
tex), paralimbic areas (e.g., the cingulate gyrus, insula, temporopolar 
cortex,  and  parts  of  orbitofrontal  regions),  the  anterior  and  medial 
nuclei of the thalamus, the medial and basal parts of the striatum, and 
the hypothalamus collectively constitute a distributed network known 
as  the  limbic  system.  The  behavioral  affiliations  of  this  network  can 
be classified into two groups. One includes the coordination of emo-
tion, motivation, affiliative behaviors, autonomic tone, and endocrine 
function. These functions are under the influence of the amygdala and 
anterior paralimbic areas. They make up the salience network. The two 
neurologic  conditions  that  most  frequently  interfere  with  this  group 
of limbic functions are temporal lobe epilepsy and behavioral variant 
frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). An additional area of specialization 
for the limbic network and the one that is of most relevance to clinical 
practice is that of declarative (explicit) memory for recent episodes and 
experiences. This function is under the influence of the hippocampus, 
entorhinal cortex, posterior paralimbic areas, and limbic nuclei of the 
thalamus.  This  part  of  the  limbic  system  is  also  known  as  the  Papez 
circuit.  A  disturbance  of  explicit  memory  is  known  as  an  amnestic 
state.  In  the  absence  of  deficits  in  motivation,  attention,  language, 
or  visuospatial  function,  the  clinical  diagnosis  of  a  persistent  global 
amnestic state is always associated with bilateral damage to the limbic 
network,  usually  within  the  hippocampo-entorhinal  complex  or  the 
thalamus. Damage to the limbic network does not necessarily destroy 
memories but interferes with their conscious recall in coherent form. 
The individual fragments of information remain preserved despite the 
limbic lesions and can sustain what is known as implicit memory. For 
example, patients with amnestic states can acquire new motor or per-
ceptual skills even though they may have no conscious knowledge of 
the experiences that led to the acquisition of these skills.

The  memory  disturbance  in  the  amnestic  state  is  multimodal  and 
includes  retrograde  and  anterograde  components.  The  retrograde 
amnesia involves an inability to recall experiences that occurred before 
the onset of the amnestic state. Relatively recent events are more vul-
nerable to retrograde amnesia than are more remote and more exten-
sively  consolidated  events.  A  patient  who  comes  to  the  emergency 
room  complaining  that  he  cannot  remember  his  or  her  identity  but 
can  remember  the  events  of  the  previous  day  almost  certainly  does 
not have a neurologic cause of memory disturbance. The second and 
most  important  component  of  the  amnestic  state  is  the  anterograde 
amnesia,  which  indicates  an  inability  to  store,  retain,  and  recall  new 
knowledge. Patients with amnestic states cannot remember what they 

ate a few hours ago or the details of an important event they may have 
experienced in the recent past. In the acute stages, there also may be a 
tendency to fill in memory gaps with inaccurate, fabricated, and often 
implausible information. This is known as confabulation. Patients with 
the  amnestic  syndrome  forget  that  they  forget  and  tend  to  deny  the 
existence  of  a  memory  problem  when  questioned.  Confabulation  is 
more common in cases where the underlying lesion also interferes with 
parts of the frontal network, as in the case of the Wernicke-Korsakoff 
syndrome or traumatic head injury.

 ■ CLINICAL EXAMINATION
A patient with an amnestic state is almost always disoriented, especially 
to  time,  and  has  little  knowledge  of  current  news.  The  anterograde 
component of an amnestic state can be tested with a list of four to five 
words read aloud by the examiner up to five times or until the patient 
can immediately repeat the entire list without an intervening delay. The 
next phase of the recall occurs after a period of 5–10 min during which 
the patient is engaged in other tasks. Amnestic patients fail this phase 
of the task and may even forget that they were given a list of words to 
remember. Accurate recognition of the words by multiple choice in a 
patient who cannot recall them indicates a less severe memory distur-
bance that affects mostly the retrieval stage of memory. The retrograde 
component  of  an  amnesia  can  be  assessed  with  questions  related  to 
autobiographical  or  historic  events.  The  anterograde  component  of 
amnestic states is usually much more prominent than the retrograde 
component.  In  rare  instances,  occasionally  associated  with  temporal 
lobe  epilepsy  or  herpes  simplex  encephalitis,  the  retrograde  compo-
nent  may  dominate.  Confusional  states  caused  by  toxic-metabolic 
encephalopathies and some types of frontal lobe damage lead to sec-
ondary memory impairments, especially at the stages of encoding and 
retrieval,  even  in  the  absence  of  limbic  lesions.  This  sort  of  memory 
impairment can be differentiated from the amnestic state by the pres-
ence of additional impairments in the attention-related tasks described 
below in the section on the frontal lobes.

 ■ CAUSES, INCLUDING ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Neurologic diseases that give rise to an amnestic state include tumors 
(of the sphenoid wing, posterior corpus callosum, thalamus, or medial 
temporal  lobe),  infarctions  (in  the  territories  of  the  anterior  or  pos-
terior  cerebral  arteries),  head  trauma,  herpes  simplex  encephalitis, 
Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy, autoimmune limbic encephalitis, 
and  degenerative  dementias  such  as  AD  and  Pick’s  disease.  The  one 
common  denominator  of  all  these  diseases  is  the  presence  of  bilat-
eral  lesions  within  one  or  more  components  in  the  limbic  network. 
Occasionally,  unilateral  left-sided  hippocampal  lesions  can  give  rise 
to  an  amnestic  state,  but  the  memory  disorder  tends  to  be  transient. 
Depending on the nature and distribution of the underlying neurologic 
disease, the patient also may have visual field deficits, eye movement 
limitations, or cerebellar findings.

The most common cause of progressive memory impairments in the 
elderly is AD. This is why a predominantly amnestic dementia is also 
known as a dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). A prodromal stage 
of DAT, when daily living activities are generally preserved, is known 
as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The predilection of the 
entorhinal cortex and hippocampus for early neurofibrillary degener-
ation by typical AD pathology is responsible for the initially selective 
impairment  of  episodic  memory.  In  time,  additional  impairments  in 
language, attention, and visuospatial skills emerge as the neurofibril-
lary  degeneration  spreads  to  additional  neocortical  areas.  Less  fre-
quently, amnestic dementias can also be caused by FTLD.

Transient  global  amnesia  is  a  distinctive  syndrome  usually  seen 
in  late  middle  age.  Patients  become  acutely  disoriented  and  repeat-
edly ask who they are, where they are, and what they are doing. The 
spell is characterized by anterograde amnesia (inability to retain new 
information)  and  a  retrograde  amnesia  for  relatively  recent  events 
that occurred before the onset. The syndrome usually resolves within 
24–48 h and is followed by the filling in of the period affected by the 
retrograde  amnesia,  although  there  is  persistent  loss  of  memory  for 
the  events  that  occurred  during  the  ictus.  Recurrences  are  noted  in

~20%  of  patients.  Migraine,  temporal  lobe  seizures,  and  perfusion 
abnormalities in the posterior cerebral territory have been postulated 
as causes of transient global amnesia. The absence of associated neu-
rologic findings occasionally may lead to the incorrect diagnosis of a 
psychiatric disorder.

THE PREFRONTAL NETWORK FOR 
EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND BEHAVIOR
The  frontal  lobes  can  be  subdivided  into  motor-premotor,  dorsolat-
eral prefrontal, medial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal components. The 
terms frontal lobe syndrome and prefrontal cortex refer only to the last 
three  of  these  four  components.  These  are  the  parts  of  the  cerebral 
cortex  that  show  the  greatest  phylogenetic  expansion  in  primates, 
especially  in  humans.  The  dorsolateral  prefrontal,  medial  prefrontal, 
and  orbitofrontal  areas,  along  with  the  subcortical  structures  with 
which  they  are  interconnected  (i.e.,  the  head  of  the  caudate  and  the 
dorsomedial  nucleus  of  the  thalamus),  collectively  make  up  a  large- 
scale network that coordinates exceedingly complex aspects of human 
cognition  and  behavior.  The  prefrontal  network  overlaps  with  the 
salience network through the anterior cingulate gyrus and parts of the 
orbitofrontal region. Impairments of social conduct and empathy seen 
in neurodegenerative frontal dementias (such as bvFTD) are attributed 
to pathology of the prefrontal and salience networks.

The  prefrontal  network  plays  an  important  role  in  behaviors  that 
require  multitasking  and  the  integration  of  thought  with  emotion. 
Cognitive  operations  impaired  by  prefrontal  cortex  lesions  often  are 
referred to as “executive functions.” The most common clinical man-
ifestations of damage to the prefrontal network take the form of two 
relatively distinct syndromes. In the frontal abulic syndrome, the patient 
shows a loss of initiative, creativity, and curiosity and displays a perva-
sive emotional blandness, apathy, and lack of empathy. In the frontal 
disinhibition  syndrome,  the  patient  becomes  socially  disinhibited  and 
shows  severe  impairments  of  judgment,  insight,  foresight,  and  the 
ability to mind rules of conduct. The dissociation between intact intel-
lectual function and a total lack of even rudimentary common sense 
is striking. Despite the preservation of all essential memory functions, 
the patient cannot learn from experience and continues to display inap-
propriate  behaviors  without  appearing  to  feel  emotional  pain,  guilt, 
or  regret  when  those  behaviors  repeatedly  lead  to  disastrous  conse-
quences. The impairments may emerge only in real-life situations when 
behavior is under minimal external control and may not be apparent 
within the structured environment of the medical office. Testing judg-
ment by asking patients what they would do if they detected a fire in a 
theater or found a stamped and addressed envelope on the road is not 
very informative because patients who answer these questions wisely in 
the office may still act very foolishly in real-life settings. The physician 
must therefore be prepared to make a diagnosis of frontal lobe disease 
based on historic information alone even when the mental state is quite 
intact in the office examination.

 ■ CLINICAL EXAMINATION
The  emergence  of  developmentally  primitive  reflexes,  also  known  as 
frontal release signs, such as grasping (elicited by stroking the palm) 
and sucking (elicited by stroking the lips) are seen primarily in patients 
with large structural lesions that extend into the premotor components 
of  the  frontal  lobes  or  in  the  context  of  metabolic  encephalopathies. 
The vast majority of patients with prefrontal lesions and frontal lobe 
behavioral  syndromes  do  not  display  these  reflexes.  Damage  to  the 
frontal lobe disrupts a variety of attention-related functions, including 
working  memory  (the  transient  online  holding  and  manipulation  of 
information), concentration span, the effortful scanning and retrieval 
of  stored  information,  the  inhibition  of  immediate  but  inappropriate 
responses,  and  mental  flexibility.  Digit  span  (which  should  be  seven 
forward and five reverse) is decreased, reflecting poor working mem-
ory; the recitation of the months of the year in reverse order (which 
should  take  <15  s)  is  slowed  as  another  indication  of  poor  working 
memory; and the fluency in producing words starting with the letter 
a,  f,  or  s  that  can  be  generated  in  1  min  (normally  ≥12  per  letter)  is 
diminished even in nonaphasic patients, indicating an impairment in 

the ability to search and retrieve information from long-term stores. In 
“go–no go” tasks (where the instruction is to raise the finger upon hear-
ing one tap but keep it still upon hearing two taps), the patient shows a 
characteristic inability to inhibit the response to the “no go” stimulus. 
Mental  flexibility  (tested  by  the  ability  to  shift  from  one  criterion  to 
another in sorting or matching tasks) is impoverished; distractibility by 
irrelevant stimuli is increased; and there is a pronounced tendency for 
impersistence and perseveration. The ability for abstracting similarities 
and interpreting proverbs is also undermined.

The attentional deficits disrupt the orderly registration and retrieval 
of new information and lead to secondary deficits of explicit memory. 
The distinction of the underlying neural mechanisms is illustrated by 
the observation that severely amnestic patients who cannot remember 
events that occurred a few minutes ago may have intact if not superior 
working memory capacity as shown in tests of digit span. The use of the 
term memory to designate two completely different mental faculties is 
confusing. Working memory depends on the on-line holding of infor-
mation for brief periods of time, whereas explicit memory depends on 
the off-line storage and subsequent retrieval of the information.

 ■ CAUSES: TRAUMA, NEOPLASM, AND 
FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA
The abulic syndrome tends to be associated with damage in dorsolat-
eral or dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and the disinhibition syndrome 
with damage in orbitofrontal or ventromedial cortex. These syndromes 
tend to arise almost exclusively after bilateral lesions. Unilateral lesions 
confined to the prefrontal cortex may remain silent until the pathology 
spreads  to  the  other  side;  this  explains  why  thromboembolic  CVA 
is  an  unusual  cause  of  the  frontal  lobe  syndrome.  When  behavioral 
syndromes  of  the  frontal  network  arise  in  conjunction  with  asym-
metric disease, the lesion tends to be predominantly on the right side 
of  the  brain.  Common  settings  for  frontal  lobe  syndromes  include 
head trauma, ruptured aneurysms, hydrocephalus, tumors (including 
metastases, glioblastoma, and falx or olfactory groove meningiomas), 
and focal degenerative diseases, especially FTLD. The most prominent 
neurodegenerative frontal syndrome is bvFTD. In many patients with 
bvFTD,  the  atrophy  includes  orbitofrontal  cortex  and  also  extends 
into the anterior temporal lobes, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex. 
Occasionally,  atrophy  predominantly  in  the  right  anterior  temporal 
lobe  presents  with  the  bvFTD  syndrome.  The  behavioral  changes  in 
these patients can range from apathy to shoplifting, compulsive gam-
bling,  sexual  indiscretions,  remarkable  lack  of  common  sense,  new 
ritualistic  behaviors,  and  alterations  in  dietary  preferences,  usually 
leading  to  increased  taste  for  sweets  or  rigid  attachment  to  specific 
food  items.  In  many  patients  with  AD,  neurofibrillary  degeneration 
eventually  spreads  to  prefrontal  cortex  and  gives  rise  to  components 
of  the  frontal  lobe  syndrome,  but  almost  always  on  a  background  of 
severe memory impairment. Rarely, the bvFTD syndrome can arise in 
isolation in the context of an atypical form of AD pathology.

Lesions in the caudate nucleus or in the dorsomedial nucleus of the 
thalamus (subcortical components of the prefrontal network) also can 
produce a frontal lobe syndrome affecting mostly executive functions. 
This  is  one  reason  why  the  changes  in  mental  state  associated  with 
degenerative  basal  ganglia  diseases  such  as  Parkinson’s  disease  and 
Huntington’s disease display components of the frontal lobe syndrome. 
Bilateral multifocal lesions of the cerebral hemispheres, none of which 
are individually large enough to cause specific cognitive deficits such as 
aphasia and neglect, can collectively interfere with the connectivity and 
therefore  integrating  (executive)  function  of  the  prefrontal  cortex.  A 
frontal lobe syndrome, usually of the abulic form, is therefore the single 
most common behavioral profile associated with a variety of bilateral 
multifocal brain diseases, including metabolic encephalopathy, multi-
ple sclerosis, and vitamin B12 deficiency, among others. Many patients 
with  the  clinical  diagnosis  of  a  frontal  lobe  syndrome  tend  to  have 
lesions that do not involve prefrontal cortex but involve either the sub-
cortical components of the prefrontal network or its connections with 
other parts of the brain. To avoid making a diagnosis of “frontal lobe 
syndrome” in a patient with no evidence of frontal cortex disease, it is 
advisable to use the diagnostic term frontal network syndrome, with the

understanding that the responsible lesions can lie anywhere within this 
distributed network. A patient with frontal lobe disease raises potential 
dilemmas  in  differential  diagnosis:  the  abulia  and  blandness  may  be 
misinterpreted as depression, and the disinhibition as idiopathic mania 
or acting out. Appropriate intervention may be delayed while a treat-
able tumor keeps expanding.

CARING FOR PATIENTS WITH DEFICITS OF 
HIGHER CEREBRAL FUNCTION
Spontaneous  improvement  of  cognitive  deficits  following  stroke  or 
trauma  is  common.  It  is  most  rapid  in  the  first  few  weeks  but  may 
continue for up to 2 years, especially in young individuals with single 
brain lesions. Some of the initial deficits in such cases appear to arise 
from  remote  dysfunction  (diaschisis)  in  brain  regions  that  are  inter-
connected with the site of initial injury. Improvement in these patients 
may reflect, at least in part, a normalization of the remote dysfunction. 
Other mechanisms may involve functional reorganization in surviving 
neurons adjacent to the injury or the compensatory use of homologous 
structures, e.g., the right superior temporal gyrus with recovery from 
Wernicke’s  aphasia.  In  contrast,  neurodegenerative  diseases  show  a 
progression of impairment but at rates that vary greatly from patient 
to patient.

Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Interventions  Some 
of the deficits described in this chapter are so complex that they may 
bewilder  not  only  the  patient  and  family  but  also  the  physician.  The 
care of patients with such deficits requires a careful evaluation of the 
history, cognitive test results, and diagnostic procedures. Each piece of 
information needs to be interpreted cautiously and placed in context. 
A  complaint  of  “poor  memory,”  for  example,  may  reflect  an  anomia; 
poor  scores  on  a  learning  task  may  reflect  a  weakness  of  attention 
rather  than  explicit  memory;  a  report  of  depression  or  indifference 
may reflect impaired prosody rather than a change in mood or empa-
thy;  jocularity  may  arise  from  poor  insight  rather  than  good  mood. 
Although  there  are  few  well-controlled  studies,  several  nonpharma-
cologic interventions  have  been  used to  treat  higher  cortical deficits. 
These  include  speech  therapy  for  aphasias,  behavioral  modification 
for  compartmental  disorders,  and  cognitive  training  for  visuospatial 
disorientation and amnestic syndromes. More practical interventions, 
usually delivered through occupational therapy, aim to improve daily 
living  activities  through  assistive  devices  and  modifications  of  the 
home  environment.  Determining  driving  competence  is  challenging, 
especially  in  the  early  stages  of  dementing  diseases.  An  on-the-road 
driving test and reports from family members may help time decisions 
related to this very important activity. In neurodegenerative conditions 
such as PPA, transcranial magnetic (or direct current) stimulation has 
had  mixed  success  in  eliciting  symptomatic  improvement.  The  goal 
is  to  activate  remaining  neurons  at  sites  of  atrophy  or  in  unaffected 
regions  of  the  contralateral  hemisphere.  Depression  and  sleep  disor-
ders can intensify the cognitive disorders and should be treated with 
appropriate modalities. If neuroleptics become absolutely necessary for 
the control of agitation, atypical neuroleptics are preferable because of 
their lower extrapyramidal side effects. Treatment with neuroleptics in 
elderly patients with dementia requires weighing the potential benefits 
against the potentially serious side effects. This is especially relevant to 
the case of patients with Lewy body dementia, who can be unusually 
sensitive to side effects.

As in all other branches of medicine, a crucial step in patient care is 
to identify the underlying cause of the impairment. This is easily done 
in cases of CVA, head trauma, or encephalitis but becomes particularly 
challenging  in  the  dementias  because  the  same  progressive  clinical 
syndrome  can  be  caused  by  one  of  several  neuropathologic  entities. 
The advent of imaging, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers now 
makes it possible to address this question with reasonable success and 
to  make  specific  diagnoses  of  AD,  LBD,  CJD,  and  FTLD.  A  specific 
etiologic diagnosis allows the physician to recommend medications or 
clinical trials that are the most appropriate for the underlying disease 
process. A clinical assessment that identifies the principal domain of 
behavioral and cognitive impairment followed by the judicious use of 

biomarker  information  to  surmise  the  nature  of  the  underlying  dis-
ease allows a personalized approach to patients with higher cognitive 
impairment.

31 Sleep Disorders

Thomas E. Scammell, Clifford B. Saper,  
Charles A. Czeisler

Disturbed  sleep  is  one  of  the  most  common  health  complaints  that 
physicians encounter. More than one-half of adults in the United States 
experience  at  least  intermittent  sleep  disturbance,  and  only  30%  of 
adult Americans report consistently obtaining a sufficient amount of 
sleep.  The  National  Academy  of  Medicine  has  estimated  that  50–70 
million Americans suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wake-
fulness,  which  can  adversely  affect  daytime  functioning  as  well  as 
physical and mental health. A high prevalence of sleep disorders across 
all cultures is also now increasingly recognized, and these problems are 
expected to further increase in the years ahead as the global population 
ages. Over the last 30 years, the field of sleep medicine has emerged as a 
distinct specialty in response to the impact of sleep disorders and sleep 
deficiency  on  overall  health.  Nonetheless,  over  80%  of  patients  with 
sleep  disorders  remain  undiagnosed  and  untreated—costing  the  U.S. 
economy over $400 billion annually in increased health care costs, lost 
productivity, accidents and injuries, and leading to the development of 
workplace-based sleep health education and sleep disorders screening 
programs designed to address this unmet medical need.

PHYSIOLOGY OF SLEEP AND 
WAKEFULNESS
Most adults need 7–9 h of sleep per night to promote optimal health, 
although  the  timing,  duration,  and  internal  structure  of  sleep  vary 
among individuals. In the United States, adults tend to have one con-
solidated sleep episode each night, although in some cultures sleep may 
be divided into a mid-afternoon nap and a shortened night sleep. This 
pattern changes considerably over the life span, as infants and young 
children sleep considerably more than older people, while individuals 
>70 years of age sleep on average about an hour less than young adults.
The stages of human sleep are defined on the basis of characteristic 
patterns  in  the  electroencephalogram  (EEG),  the  electrooculogram 
(EOG—a measure of eye-movement activity), and the surface electro-
myogram (EMG) measured on the chin, neck, and legs. The continu-
ous  recording  of  these  electrophysiologic  parameters  to  define  sleep 
and wakefulness is termed polysomnography.

Polysomnographic profiles define two basic states of sleep: (1) rapid 
eye movement (REM) sleep and (2) non–rapid eye movement (NREM)

disorders  (see  below)  also  cause  sleep  fragmentation,  it  is 
important that the patient have sufficient sleep opportunity 
(at least 8 h per night) for several nights prior to a diagnostic 
polysomnogram.

There  is  growing  evidence  that  inadequate  sleep  in 
humans  is  associated  with  glucose  intolerance  that  may 
contribute to the development of diabetes, obesity, and the 
metabolic syndrome, as well as impaired immune responses, 
accelerated  atherosclerosis,  and  increased  risk  of  cardiac 
disease,  cognitive  impairment,  Alzheimer’s  disease,  and 
stroke. For these reasons, the National Academy of Medicine 
declared  sleep  deficiency  and  sleep  disorders  “an  unmet 
public health problem.”

sleep. NREM sleep is further subdivided into three stages: N1, N2, and 
N3, characterized by an increasing threshold for arousal and slowing 
of  the  cortical  EEG.  REM  sleep  is  characterized  by  a  low-amplitude, 
mixed-frequency EEG, similar to NREM stage N1 sleep, and an EOG 
pattern of REMs that tend to occur in flurries or bursts. EMG activity 
is  absent  in  nearly  all  skeletal  muscles  except  those  involved  in  res-
piration,  reflecting  the  brainstem-mediated  muscle  paralysis  that  is 
characteristic of REM sleep.

 ■ ORGANIZATION OF HUMAN SLEEP
Normal  nocturnal  sleep  in  adults  displays  a  consistent  organization 
from  night  to  night  (Fig.  31-1).  After  sleep  onset,  sleep  usually  pro-
gresses through NREM stages N1–N3 sleep within 45–60 min. NREM 
stage  N3  sleep  (also  known  as  slow-wave  sleep)  predominates  in  the 
first third of the night and comprises 15–25% of total nocturnal sleep 
time in young adults. Sleep deprivation increases the rapidity of sleep 
onset and both the intensity and amount of slow-wave sleep.

The first REM sleep episode usually occurs in the second hour of 
sleep. NREM and REM sleep alternate through the night with an aver-
age  period  of  90–110  min  (the  “ultradian”  sleep  cycle).  Overall,  in  a 
healthy young adult, REM sleep constitutes 20–25% of total sleep, and 
NREM stages N1 and N2 constitute 50–60%.

Age has a profound impact on sleep state organization (Fig. 31-1). 
N3 sleep is most intense and prominent during childhood, decreasing 
with puberty and across the second and third decades of life. In older 
adults, N3 sleep may be completely absent, and the remaining NREM 
sleep  typically  becomes  more  fragmented,  with  frequent  awaken-
ings  from  NREM  sleep.  It  is  the  increased  frequency  of  awakenings, 
rather  than  a  decreased  ability  to  fall  back  asleep,  that  accounts  for 
the  increased  wakefulness  during  the  sleep  episode  in  older  people. 
While REM sleep may account for 50% of total sleep time in infancy, 
the percentage falls off sharply over the first postnatal year as a mature 
REM-NREM cycle develops; thereafter, REM sleep occupies about 25% 
of total sleep time.

Sleep  deprivation  degrades  cognitive  performance,  particularly  on 
tests  that  require  continual  vigilance.  Paradoxically,  older  people  are 
less vulnerable than young adults to the neurobehavioral performance 
impairment  induced  by  acute  sleep  deprivation,  maintaining  their 
reaction time and sustaining vigilance with fewer lapses of attention. 
However, it is more difficult for older adults to obtain recovery sleep 
after staying awake all night, as the ability to sleep during the daytime 
declines with age.

After  sleep  deprivation,  NREM  sleep  generally  recovers  first,  fol-
lowed by REM sleep. However, because REM sleep tends to be most 
prominent  in  the  second  half  of  the  night,  sleep  truncation  (e.g.,  by 
an alarm clock) results in selective REM sleep deprivation. This may 
increase  REM  sleep  pressure  to  the  point  where  the  first  REM  sleep 
may occur much earlier in the nightly sleep episode. Because several 

 ■ WAKE AND SLEEP ARE REGULATED BY 
BRAIN CIRCUITS
Two  principal  neural  systems  govern  the  expression  of 
sleep and wakefulness. The ascending arousal system, illus-
trated  in  green  in  Fig.  31-2,  consists  of  clusters  of  nerve 
cells  extending  from  the  upper  pons  to  the  hypothalamus 
and basal forebrain that activate the cerebral cortex, thala-
mus  (which  is  necessary  to  relay  sensory  information  to  the  cortex), 
and  other  forebrain  regions.  The  ascending  arousal  neurons  use 
monoamines  (norepinephrine,  dopamine,  serotonin,  and  histamine), 
glutamate,  or  acetylcholine  as  neurotransmitters  to  activate  their  tar-
get  neurons.  Some  basal  forebrain  neurons  use  γ-aminobutyric  acid 
(GABA)  to  inhibit  cortical  inhibitory  interneurons,  thus  promoting 
arousal. Additional wake-promoting neurons in the hypothalamus use 
the peptide neurotransmitter orexin (also known as hypocretin, shown 
in Fig. 31-2 in blue) to reinforce activity in the other arousal cell groups.
Damage  to  the  arousal  system  at  the  level  of  the  rostral  pons  and 
lower  midbrain  causes  coma,  indicating  that  the  ascending  arousal 
influence from this level is critical in maintaining wakefulness. Injury 
to  the  hypothalamic  branch  of  the  arousal  system  causes  profound 
sleepiness  but  usually  not  coma.  Specific  loss  of  the  orexin  neurons 
produces  the  sleep  disorder  narcolepsy  (see  below).  Isolated  damage 
to the thalamus causes loss of the content of wakefulness, known as a 
persistent vegetative state, but wake-sleep cycles are largely preserved.
The arousal system is turned off during sleep by inhibitory inputs 
from cell groups in the sleep-promoting system, shown in Fig. 31-2 in 
red. These neurons in the preoptic area and pons use GABA to inhibit 
the  arousal  system.  Additional  neurons  in  the  lateral  hypothalamus 
containing  the  peptide  melanin-concentrating  hormone  promote 
REM  sleep.  Many  sleep-promoting  neurons  are  themselves  inhibited 
by  inputs  from  the  arousal  system.  This  mutual  inhibition  between 
the arousal- and sleep-promoting systems forms a neural circuit akin 
to  what  electrical  engineers  call  a  “flip-flop  switch.”  A  switch  of  this 
type tends to promote rapid transitions between the on (wake) and off 
(sleep) states, while avoiding intermediate states. The relatively rapid 
transitions between waking and sleeping states, as seen in the EEG of 
humans and animals, is consistent with this model.

Neurons  in  the  ventrolateral  preoptic  nucleus,  one  of  the  key 
sleep-promoting sites, are lost during normal human aging, correlat-
ing  with  reduced  ability  to  maintain  sleep  (sleep  fragmentation). 
The  ventrolateral  preoptic  neurons  are  also  injured  in  Alzheimer’s 
disease, which may in part account for the poor sleep quality in those 
patients.

Transitions between NREM and REM sleep appear to be governed 
by  a  similar  switch  in  the  brainstem.  GABAergic  REM-Off  neurons 
have been identified in the lower midbrain that inhibit REM-On neu-
rons in the upper pons. The REM-On group contains both GABAergic 
neurons that inhibit the REM-Off group (thus satisfying the conditions 
for a REM sleep flip-flop switch) as well as glutamatergic neurons that 
project  widely  in  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  to  cause  the  key 
phenomena associated with REM sleep. REM-On neurons that project 
to the medulla and spinal cord activate inhibitory (GABA and glycine- 
containing)  interneurons,  which  in  turn  hyperpolarize  the  motor 
neurons, producing the paralysis of REM sleep. REM-On neurons that 
project to the forebrain may be important in producing dreams.

FIGURE 31-2  Relationship of drugs for insomnia with wake-sleep systems. The arousal system in the brain (green) includes monoaminergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic 
neurons in the brainstem that activate neurons in the hypothalamus, thalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex. Orexin neurons (blue) in the hypothalamus, which are 
lost in narcolepsy, reinforce and stabilize arousal by activating other components of the arousal system. The sleep-promoting system (red) consists of GABAergic neurons 
in the preoptic area and brainstem that inhibit the components of the arousal system, thus allowing sleep to occur. Drugs used to treat insomnia include those that block 
the effects of arousal system neurotransmitters (green and blue) and those that enhance the effects of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) produced by the sleep system (red).

The  REM  sleep  switch  receives  cholinergic  input,  which  favors 
transitions  to  REM  sleep,  and  monoaminergic  (norepinephrine  and 
serotonin)  input  that  prevents  REM  sleep.  As  a  result,  drugs  that 
increase monoamine tone (e.g., serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors)  tend  to  reduce  the  amount  of  REM  sleep.  Damage  to  the 
neurons  that  promote  REM  sleep  paralysis  can  produce  REM  sleep 
behavior disorder, a condition in which patients act out their dreams 
(see below).
 ■ SLEEP-WAKE CYCLES ARE DRIVEN BY 
HOMEOSTATIC, ALLOSTATIC, AND CIRCADIAN 
INPUTS
The  gradual  increase  in  sleep  drive  with  prolonged  wakefulness, 
followed  by  deeper  slow-wave  sleep  and  prolonged  sleep  episodes, 
demonstrates  that  there  is  a  homeostatic  mechanism  that  regulates 
sleep.  The  neurochemistry  of  sleep  homeostasis  is  only  partially 
understood, but with prolonged wakefulness, adenosine levels rise in 
parts of the brain. Adenosine may act through A1 receptors to directly 
inhibit many arousal-promoting brain regions. In addition, adenosine 
promotes sleep through A2a receptors; blockade of these receptors by 
caffeine is one of the chief ways in which people fight sleepiness. Other 
humoral factors, such as prostaglandin D2, have also been implicated 
in  this  process.  Both  adenosine  and  prostaglandin  D2  activate  the 
sleep-promoting neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus.

Allostasis is the physiologic response to a challenge such as physical 
danger or psychological threat that cannot be managed by homeostatic 
mechanisms. These stress responses can severely impact the need for 

and ability to sleep. For example, insomnia is very common in patients 
with anxiety and other psychiatric disorders. Stress-induced insomnia 
is  even  more  common,  affecting  most  people  at  some  time  in  their 
lives.  Positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  studies  in  patients  with 
chronic insomnia show hyperactivation of components of the ascend-
ing arousal system, as well as their limbic system targets in the forebrain 
(e.g., cingulate cortex and amygdala). The limbic areas are not only tar-
gets for the arousal system, but they also send excitatory outputs back 
to the arousal system, which contributes to a vicious cycle of anxiety 
about  insomnia  that  makes  it  more  difficult  to  sleep.  Approaches  to 
treating insomnia may employ drugs that either inhibit the output of 
the ascending arousal system (green and  blue in Fig. 31-2) or poten-
tiate  the  output  of  the  sleep-promoting  system  (red  in  Fig.  31-2).  
However, behavioral approaches (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] 
and sleep hygiene) that may reduce forebrain limbic activity at bedtime 
are often the best long-term treatment.

Sleep is also regulated by a strong circadian timing signal, driven by 
the  suprachiasmatic  nuclei  (SCN)  of  the  hypothalamus,  as  described 
below. The SCN sends outputs to key sites in the hypothalamus, which 
impose 24-h rhythms on a wide range of behaviors and body systems, 
including the wake-sleep cycle.
 ■ PHYSIOLOGY OF CIRCADIAN RHYTHMICITY
The  wake-sleep  cycle  is  the  most  evident  of  many  24-h  rhythms  in 
humans.  Prominent  daily  variations  also  occur  in  endocrine,  ther-
moregulatory,  cardiac,  pulmonary,  renal,  immune,  gastrointestinal, 
and neurobehavioral functions. In evaluating daily rhythms in humans,

it  is  important  to  distinguish  between  diurnal  components  passively 
evoked  by  periodic  environmental  or  behavioral  changes  (e.g.,  the 
increase in blood pressure and heart rate that occurs upon assumption 
of  the  upright  posture)  and  circadian  rhythms  actively  driven  by  an 
endogenous oscillatory process (e.g., the circadian variations in adrenal 
cortisol and pineal melatonin secretion that persist across a variety of 
environmental and behavioral conditions).

At the cellular level, endogenous circadian rhythmicity is driven by 
self-sustaining  feedback  loops.  While  it  is  now  recognized  that  most 
cells in the body have circadian clocks that regulate diverse physiologic 
processes, these clocks in different tissues, or even in different cells in 
the same tissue, when placed in isolation in a tissue explant are unable 
to  maintain  the  long-term  synchronization  with  each  other  that  is 
required  to  produce  useful  24-h  rhythms  aligned  with  the  external 
light-dark cycle. The only tissue that maintains this rhythm in vitro is 
the SCN, whose neurons are interconnected with one another in such 
a way as to produce a near-24-h synchronous rhythm of neural activity 
even in prolonged slice culture. SCN neurons are located just above the 
optic chiasm in the hypothalamus, from which they receive visual input 
to synchronize them with the external world, and they have outputs to 
transmit that signal to the rest of the body. Bilateral destruction of the 
SCN results in a loss of most endogenous circadian rhythms including 
wake-sleep behavior and rhythms in endocrine and metabolic systems. 
The genetically determined period of this endogenous neural oscillator, 
which averages ~24.15 h in humans, is normally synchronized to the 
24-h period of the environmental light-dark cycle through direct input 
from  intrinsically  photosensitive  ganglion  cells  in  the  retina  to  the 
SCN. Humans are exquisitely sensitive to the resetting effects of light, 
particularly the shorter wavelengths (~460–500 nm) in the blue part of 
the visible spectrum. Small differences in circadian period contribute 
to variations in diurnal preference. Changes in homeostatic sleep regu-
lation may underlie age-related changes in sleep-wake timing.

The timing and internal architecture of sleep are directly coupled 
to  the  output  of  the  endogenous  circadian  pacemaker.  Paradoxi-
cally,  the  endogenous  circadian  rhythm  for  wake  propensity  peaks 
just  before  the  habitual  bedtime,  whereas  that  of  sleep  propensity 
peaks near the habitual wake time. These rhythms are thus timed to 
oppose  the  rise  of  sleep  tendency  throughout  the  usual  waking  day 
and the decline of sleep propensity during the habitual sleep episode, 
respectively, thus promoting consolidated sleep and wakefulness. Mis-
alignment  of  the  endogenous  circadian  pacemaker  with  the  desired 
wake-sleep  cycle  can,  therefore,  induce  insomnia,  decrease  alertness, 
and impair performance, posing health problems for night-shift work-
ers and airline travelers.

 ■ BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSIOLOGIC CORRELATES 
OF SLEEP STATES AND STAGES
Polysomnographic  staging  of  sleep  correlates  with  behavioral  changes 
during specific states and stages. During the transitional state (stage N1) 
between wakefulness and deeper sleep, individuals may respond to faint 
auditory or visual signals. Formation of short-term memories is inhibited 
at the onset of NREM stage N1 sleep, which may explain why individuals 
aroused  from  that  transitional  sleep  stage  frequently  lack  situational 
awareness. After sleep deprivation, such transitions may intrude upon 
behavioral  wakefulness  notwithstanding  attempts  to  remain  continu-
ously awake (for example, see “Shift-Work Disorder,” below).

Subjects  awakened  from  REM  sleep  recall  vivid  dream  imagery 
>80% of the time, especially later in the night. Less vivid imagery may 
also  be  reported  after  NREM  sleep  interruptions.  Certain  disorders 
may occur during specific sleep stages and are described below under 
“Parasomnias.” These include sleepwalking, night terrors, and enuresis 
(bed wetting), which occur most commonly in children during deep 
(N3)  NREM  sleep,  and  REM  sleep  behavior  disorder,  which  occurs 
mainly  among  older  men  who  fail  to  maintain  full  paralysis  during 
REM sleep, and often call out, thrash around, or even act out fragments 
of dreams.

All major physiologic systems are influenced by sleep. Blood pres-
sure and heart rate decrease during NREM sleep, particularly during 
N3 sleep. During REM sleep, bursts of eye movements are associated 

with large variations in both blood pressure and heart rate mediated by 
the autonomic nervous system. Cardiac dysrhythmias may occur selec-
tively during REM sleep. Respiratory function also changes. In com-
parison  to  relaxed  wakefulness,  respiratory  rate  becomes  slower  but 
more regular during NREM sleep (especially N3 sleep) and becomes 
irregular during bursts of eye movements in REM sleep. Decreases in 
minute  ventilation  during  NREM  sleep  are  out  of  proportion  to  the 
decrease in metabolic rate, resulting in a slightly higher Pco2.

Within the brain itself, neurotransmission is supported by ion gra-
dients across the cell membranes of neurons and astrocytes. These ion 
flows  are  accompanied  by  increases  in  intracellular  volume,  so  that 
during wake, there is very little extracellular space in the brain. During 
sleep, intracellular volume is reduced, resulting in increased extracel-
lular  space,  which  has  higher  calcium  and  lower  potassium  concen-
trations, supporting hyperpolarization and reduced firing of neurons. 
This  expansion  of  the  extracellular  space  during  sleep  increases  dif-
fusion  of  substances  that  accumulate  extracellularly,  like  β-amyloid 
peptide,  enhancing  their  clearance  from  the  brain  via  cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) flow. Recent evidence suggests that lack of adequate sleep 
may contribute to extracellular accumulation of β-amyloid peptide, a 
key step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease.

Endocrine  function  also  varies  with  sleep.  N3  sleep  is  associated 
with  secretion  of  growth  hormone  in  men,  while  sleep  in  general  is 
associated  with  augmented  secretion  of  prolactin  in  both  men  and 
women.  Sleep  has  a  complex  effect  on  the  secretion  of  luteinizing 
hormone (LH): during puberty, sleep is associated with increased LH 
secretion, whereas sleep in postpubertal women inhibits LH secretion 
in  the  early  follicular  phase  of  the  menstrual  cycle.  Sleep  onset  (and 
probably N3 sleep) is associated with inhibition of thyroid-stimulating 
hormone  and  of  the  adrenocorticotropic  hormone–cortisol  axis,  an 
effect that is superimposed on the prominent circadian rhythms in the 
two systems.

The pineal hormone melatonin is secreted predominantly at night 
in both day- and night-active species, reflecting the direct modulation 
of  pineal  activity  by  the  SCN  via  the  sympathetic  nervous  system, 
which  innervates  the  pineal  gland.  Melatonin  secretion  does  not 
require sleep, but melatonin secretion is inhibited by ambient light, an 
effect mediated by the neural connection from the retina to the pineal 
gland via the SCN. In humans, sleep efficiency is highest when sleep 
coincides  with  endogenous  melatonin  secretion.  When  endogenous 
melatonin  levels  are  low,  such  as  during  the  biological  day  or  at  the 
desired  bedtime  in  people  with  delayed  sleep-wake  phase  disorder 
(DSWPD),  administration  of  exogenous  melatonin  can  hasten  sleep 
onset and increase sleep efficiency, but it does not increase sleep effi-
ciency if administered when endogenous melatonin levels are elevated. 
This may explain why melatonin is often ineffective in the treatment 
of patients with primary insomnia. On the other hand, patients with 
sympathetic denervation of the pineal gland, such as occurs in cervical 
spinal  cord  injury  or  in  patients  with  Parkinson’s  disease,  often  have 
low melatonin levels, and administration of melatonin (3 mg 30 min 
before bedtime) may help them sleep.

Sleep is accompanied by alterations of thermoregulatory function. 
NREM  sleep  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  firing  of  warm- 
responsive neurons in the preoptic area and a fall in body temperature; 
conversely,  skin  warming  without  increasing  core  body  temperature 
has been found to increase NREM sleep. REM sleep is associated with 
reduced thermoregulatory responsiveness.

DISORDERS OF SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Sleep Disorders

Patients may seek help from a physician because of: (1) sleepiness 
or tiredness during the day; (2) difficulty initiating or maintaining 
sleep  at  night  (insomnia);  or  (3)  unusual  behaviors  during  sleep 
itself (parasomnias).

Obtaining a careful history is essential. In particular, the dura-
tion, severity, and consistency of the symptoms are important, along 
with the patient’s estimate of the consequences of the sleep disorder 
on  waking  function.  Information  from  a  bed  partner  or  family 
member is often helpful because some patients may be unaware of 
symptoms  such  as  heavy  snoring  or  may  underreport  symptoms 
such as falling asleep at work or while driving. Physicians should 
inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall 
asleep  and  wake  up,  whether  they  awaken  during  sleep,  whether 
they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the 
day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask 
about  snoring,  witnessed  apneas,  restless  sensations  in  the  legs, 
movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around 
the sleep episode. The physical examination may provide evidence 
of a small airway, large tonsils, or a neurologic or medical disorder 
that contributes to the main complaint.

It  is  important  to  remember  that,  rarely,  seizures  may  occur 
exclusively during sleep, mimicking a primary sleep disorder; such 
sleep-related  seizures  typically  occur  during  episodes  of  NREM 
sleep and may take the form of generalized tonic-clonic movements 
(sometimes with urinary incontinence or tongue biting) or stereo-
typed movements in partial complex epilepsy (Chap. 418).

It  is  often  helpful  for  the  patient  to  complete  a  daily  sleep  log 
for  1–2  weeks  to  define  the  timing  and  amounts  of  sleep.  When 
relevant,  the  log  can  also  include  information  on  levels  of  alert-
ness, work times, and drug and alcohol use, including caffeine and 
hypnotics.

Polysomnography is necessary for the diagnosis of several disor-
ders such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and periodic limb movement 
disorder  (PLMD).  A  conventional  polysomnogram  performed  in 
a  clinical  sleep  laboratory  allows  measurement  of  sleep  stages, 
respiratory effort and airflow, oxygen saturation, limb movements, 
heart rhythm, and additional parameters. A home sleep test usually 
focuses on just respiratory measures and is helpful in patients with 
a  moderate  to  high  likelihood  of  having  obstructive  sleep  apnea. 
The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is used to measure a patient’s 
propensity to sleep during the day and can provide crucial evidence 
for  diagnosing  narcolepsy  and  some  other  causes  of  sleepiness. 
The maintenance of wakefulness test is used to measure a patient’s 
ability to sustain wakefulness during the daytime and can provide 
important  evidence  for  evaluating  the  efficacy  of  therapies  for 
improving sleepiness in conditions such as narcolepsy and obstruc-
tive sleep apnea.

 ■ EVALUATION OF DAYTIME SLEEPINESS
Up  to  25%  of  the  adult  population  has  persistent  daytime  sleepiness 
that impairs an individual’s ability to perform optimally in school, at 
work,  while  driving,  and  in  other  conditions  that  require  alertness. 
Sleepy students often have trouble staying alert and performing well in 
school, and sleepy adults struggle to stay awake and focused on their 
work. More than half of Americans have fallen asleep while driving. An 
estimated 1.2 million motor vehicle crashes per year are due to drowsy 
drivers, causing about 20% of all serious crash injuries and deaths. One 
need not fall asleep to have a motor vehicle crash, as the inattention and 
slowed  responses  of  drowsy  drivers  are  major  contributors.  Twenty-
four hours of continuous wakefulness impairs reaction time as much 
as a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 g/dL (which is legally drunk 
in all 50 states).

Identifying  and  quantifying  sleepiness  can  be  challenging.  First, 
patients may describe themselves as “sleepy,” “fatigued,” or “tired,” and 
the meanings of these words may differ between patients. For clinical 
purposes, it is best to use the term “sleepiness” to describe a propen-
sity  to  fall  asleep,  whereas  “fatigue”  is  best  used  to  describe  a  feeling 
of  low  physical  or  mental  energy  but  without  a  tendency  to  actually 
sleep. Sleepiness is usually most evident when the patient is sedentary, 
whereas  fatigue  may  interfere  with  more  active  pursuits.  Sleepiness 
generally occurs with disorders that reduce the quality or quantity of 
sleep or that interfere with the neural mechanisms of arousal, whereas 
fatigue  is  more  common  in  inflammatory  disorders  such  as  cancer, 
multiple  sclerosis  (Chap.  444),  fibromyalgia  (Chap.  373),  chronic 
fatigue syndrome (Chap. 450), or endocrine deficiencies such as hypo-
thyroidism  (Chap.  383)  or  Addison’s  disease  (Chap.  386).  Second, 
sleepiness can affect judgment in a manner analogous to ethanol, such 
that patients may have limited insight into the condition and the extent 
of  their  functional  impairment.  Finally,  patients  may  be  reluctant  to 
admit  that  sleepiness  is  a  problem  because  they  may  have  become 
unfamiliar with feeling fully alert, and because sleepiness is sometimes 
viewed pejoratively as reflecting poor motivation or bad sleep habits.

Table 31-1 outlines the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the 

patient with a complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness.

To determine the extent and impact of sleepiness on daytime function, 
it is helpful to ask patients about the occurrence of sleep episodes during 
normal waking hours, both intentional and unintentional. Specific areas 
to  be  addressed  include  the  occurrence  of  inadvertent  sleep  episodes 
while driving or in other safety-related settings, sleepiness while at work 
or school (and its impact on performance), and the effect of sleepiness on 
social and family life. Standardized questionnaires such as the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale are often used clinically to measure sleepiness.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesEliciting  a  history  of  daytime  sleepiness  is  usually  adequate,  but 
objective quantification is sometimes necessary. The MSLT measures a 
patient’s propensity to sleep under quiet conditions. An overnight poly-
somnogram should precede the MSLT to establish that the patient has 
had an adequate amount of good-quality nighttime sleep. The MSLT 
consists of five 20-min nap opportunities every 2 h across the day. The 
patient is instructed to try to fall asleep, and the major endpoints are 
the average latency to sleep and the occurrence of REM sleep during 
the naps. An average sleep latency across the naps of <8 min is con-
sidered objective evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. REM sleep 
normally  occurs  only  during  nighttime  sleep,  and  the  occurrence  of 
REM sleep in two or more of the MSLT daytime naps provides support 
for the diagnosis of narcolepsy.

For  the  safety  of  the  individual  and  the  general  public,  physicians 
have a responsibility to help manage issues around driving in patients 
with  sleepiness.  Legal  reporting  requirements  vary  between  states 
and  countries,  but  at  a  minimum,  physicians  should  inform  sleepy 
patients  about  their  increased  risk  of  having  an  accident  and  advise 
such patients not to drive a motor vehicle until the sleepiness has been 
treated  effectively.  This  discussion  is  especially  important  for  com-
mercial drivers, and it should be documented in the patient’s medical 
record.
 ■ INSUFFICIENT SLEEP
Insufficient  sleep  is  probably  the  most  common  cause  of  excessive 
daytime  sleepiness.  The  average  adult  needs  7.5–8  h  of  sleep,  but  on 
weeknights the average U.S. adult gets only 6.75 h of sleep. Only 30% 
of  the  U.S.  adult  population  reports  consistently  obtaining  sufficient 
sleep.  Insufficient  sleep  is  especially  common  among  shift  workers, 
individuals working multiple jobs, and people in lower socioeconomic 
groups. Most teenagers need ≥9 h of sleep, but many fail to get enough 
sleep because of circadian phase delay, plus social pressures to stay up 
late coupled with early school start times. Late evening light exposure, 
television  viewing,  video-gaming,  social  media,  texting,  and  smart-
phone  use  often  delay  bedtimes,  despite  the  fixed  early  wake  times 
required for work or school. As is typical with any disorder that causes 
sleepiness, individuals with chronically insufficient sleep may feel inat-
tentive, irritable, unmotivated, and depressed, and have difficulty with 
school, work, and driving. Individuals differ in their optimal amount of 
sleep, and it can be helpful to ask how much sleep the patient obtains 
on a quiet vacation when he or she can sleep without restrictions. Some 
patients may think that a short amount of sleep is normal or advan-
tageous,  and  they  may  not  appreciate  their  biological  need  for  more 
sleep,  especially  if  coffee  and  other  stimulants  mask  the  sleepiness. 
A  2-week  sleep  log  documenting  the  timing  of  sleep  and  daily  level 
of alertness is diagnostically useful and provides helpful feedback for 
the patient. Extending sleep to the optimal amount on a regular basis 
can  resolve  the  sleepiness  and  other  symptoms.  As  with  any  lifestyle 
change,  extending  sleep  requires  commitment  and  adjustments,  but 
the improvements in daytime alertness 
make this change worthwhile.

conditions  appropriately  may  reduce  daytime  alertness  and  increase 
the risk of sleep-related motor vehicle crashes, depression, hyperten-
sion, myocardial infarction, diabetes, stroke, and mortality. Sleep apnea 
is  particularly  prevalent  in  overweight  men  and  in  the  elderly,  yet  it 
is  estimated  to  go  undiagnosed  in  most  affected  individuals.  This  is 
unfortunate because several effective treatments are available. Readers 
are referred to Chap. 297 for a comprehensive review of the diagno-
sis and treatment of patients with sleep apnea.
 ■ NARCOLEPSY
Narcolepsy is characterized by difficulty sustaining wakefulness, poor 
regulation  of  REM  sleep,  and  disturbed  nocturnal  sleep.  All  patients 
with  narcolepsy  have  excessive  daytime  sleepiness.  This  sleepiness  is 
usually moderate to severe, and in contrast to patients with disrupted 
sleep (e.g., sleep apnea), people with narcolepsy usually feel well rested 
upon awakening and then feel tired throughout much of the day. They 
may  fall  asleep  at  inappropriate  times,  but  then  feel  refreshed  again 
after a nap. In addition, they often experience symptoms related to an 
intrusion  of  REM  sleep  characteristics  into  wakefulness.  REM  sleep 
is  characterized  by  dreaming  and  muscle  paralysis,  and  people  with 
narcolepsy can have: (1) sudden muscle weakness without a loss of con-
sciousness,  which  is  usually  triggered  by  strong  emotions  (cataplexy; 
Video 31-1); (2) dream-like hallucinations at sleep onset (hypnagogic 
hallucinations) or upon awakening (hypnopompic hallucinations); and 
(3)  muscle  paralysis  upon  awakening  (sleep  paralysis).  With  severe 
cataplexy, an individual may be laughing at a joke and then suddenly 
collapse to the ground, immobile but awake for 1–2 min. With milder 
episodes, patients may have partial weakness of the face or neck. Nar-
colepsy is one of the more common causes of chronic sleepiness and 
affects about 1 in 2000 people in the United States. Narcolepsy typically 
begins  between  age  10  and  20;  once  established,  the  disease  persists 
for life.

Narcolepsy is caused by loss of the hypothalamic neurons that pro-
duce the orexin neuropeptides (also known as hypocretins). Research 
in  mice  and  dogs  first  demonstrated  that  a  loss  of  orexin  signaling 
due to null mutations of either the orexin neuropeptides or one of the 
orexin  receptors  causes  sleepiness  and  cataplexy  nearly  identical  to 
that seen in people with narcolepsy. Although genetic mutations rarely 
cause  human  narcolepsy,  researchers  soon  discovered  that  patients 
with  narcolepsy  with  cataplexy  (now  called  type  1  narcolepsy)  have 
very  low  or  undetectable  levels  of  orexins  in  their  CSF,  and  autopsy 
studies showed a nearly complete loss of the orexin-producing neurons 
in the hypothalamus. The orexins normally promote long episodes of 
wakefulness and suppress REM sleep, and thus loss of orexin signaling 
results  in  frequent  intrusions  of  sleep  during  the  usual  waking  epi-
sode, with REM sleep and fragments of REM sleep at any time of day  
(Fig.  31-3).  Patients  with  narcolepsy  but  no  cataplexy  (type  2  nar-
colepsy)  usually  have  normal  orexin  levels  and  may  have  other  yet 
uncharacterized causes of their excessive daytime sleepiness.

 ■ SLEEP APNEA SYNDROMES
Respiratory  dysfunction  during  sleep 
is  a  common,  serious  cause  of  exces-
sive  daytime  sleepiness  as  well  as  of 
disturbed nocturnal sleep. At least 24% 
of middle-aged men and 9% of middle- 
aged women in the United States have 
a  reduction  or  cessation  of  breathing 
dozens  or  more  times  each  night  dur-
ing  sleep,  with  9%  of  men  and  4%  of 
women doing so more than a hundred 
times  per  night.  These  episodes  may 
be  due  to  an  occlusion  of  the  airway 
(obstructive  sleep  apnea),  absence  of 
respiratory  effort  (central  sleep  apnea), 
or  a  combination  of  these  factors.

awake from 8:00 a.m. until midnight, but the patient with narcolepsy dozes off frequently, with many daytime naps that

Extensive  evidence  suggests  that  an  autoimmune  process  likely 
causes  this  selective  loss  of  the  orexin-producing  neurons.  Certain 
human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) can increase the risk of autoimmune 
disorders (Chap. 350), and narcolepsy has the strongest known HLA 
association. HLA DQB1*06:02 is found in >90% of people with type 1 
narcolepsy,  whereas  it  occurs  in  only  12–25%  of  the  general  popula-
tion. Researchers now hypothesize that in people with DQB1*06:02, an 
immune response against influenza, Streptococcus, or other infections 
may also damage the orexin-producing neurons through a process of 
molecular  mimicry.  This  mechanism  may  account  for  the  eight-  to 
twelvefold  increase  in  new  cases  of  narcolepsy  among  children  in 
Europe who received a particular brand of H1N1 influenza A vaccine 
(Pandemrix). In support of this hypothesis, people with type 1 narco-
lepsy have heightened T cell responses against orexin peptides.

On rare occasions, narcolepsy can occur with neurologic disorders 
such as tumors or strokes that directly damage the orexin-producing 
neurons in the hypothalamus or their projections.

Diagnosis  Narcolepsy is most commonly diagnosed by the history 
of chronic sleepiness plus cataplexy or other symptoms. Many disor-
ders  can  cause  feelings  of  weakness,  but  with  true  cataplexy  patients 
will describe definite functional weakness (e.g., slurred speech, drop-
ping a cup, slumping into a chair) that has consistent emotional triggers 
such  as  laughing  at  a  joke,  happy  surprise  at  unexpectedly  seeing  a 
friend, or intense anger. Cataplexy occurs in about half of all narcolepsy 
patients and is diagnostically very helpful because it occurs in almost 
no  other  disorder.  In  contrast,  occasional  hypnagogic  hallucinations 
and sleep paralysis occur in about 20% of the general population, and 
these symptoms are not as diagnostically specific.

When  narcolepsy  is  suspected,  the  diagnosis  should  be  firmly 
established  with  a  polysomnogram  followed  the  next  day  by  an 
MSLT.  The  polysomnogram  helps  rule  out  other  possible  causes 
of  sleepiness  such  as  sleep  apnea  and  establishes  that  the  patient 
had  adequate  sleep  the  night  before,  and  the  MSLT  provides  essen-
tial,  objective  evidence  of  sleepiness  plus  REM  sleep  dysregulation. 
Across  the  five  naps  of  the  MSLT,  most  patients  with  narcolepsy 
will  fall  asleep  in  <8  min  on  average,  and  they  will  have  episodes  of 
REM  sleep  in  at  least  two  of  the  naps.  Abnormal  regulation  of  REM 
sleep  is  also  manifested  by  the  appearance  of  REM  sleep  within 
15  min  of  sleep  onset  at  night,  which  is  rare  in  healthy  individuals 
sleeping  at  their  habitual  bedtime.  Stimulants  should  be  stopped  
1  week  before  the  MSLT  and  antidepressants  should  be  stopped  
3 weeks prior, because these medications can affect the MSLT. In addi-
tion, patients should be encouraged to obtain a fully adequate amount 
of sleep each night for the week prior to the test to eliminate any effects 
of insufficient sleep.

TREATMENT
Narcolepsy

The  treatment  of  narcolepsy  is  symptomatic.  Most  patients  with 
narcolepsy feel more alert after sleep, and they should be encour-
aged to get adequate sleep each night and to take a 15- to 20-min 
nap in the afternoon. This nap may be sufficient for some patients 
with mild narcolepsy, but most also require treatment with wake- 
promoting  medications.  Modafinil  is  often  used  because  it  has 
fewer  side  effects  than  amphetamines  and  a  relatively  long  half-
life; for most patients, 200–400 mg each morning is very effective. 
Methylphenidate  (10–20  mg  bid)  or  dextroamphetamine  (10  mg 
bid)  are  also  effective,  but  sympathomimetic  side  effects,  anxiety, 
and the potential for abuse can be concerns. These medications are 
available in slow-release formulations, extending their duration of 
action and allowing easier dosing. Solriamfetol, a norepinephrine–
dopamine  reuptake  inhibitor  (75–150  mg  daily),  and  pitolisant,  a 
selective histamine 3 (H3) receptor antagonist (8.9–35.6 mg daily), 
also improve sleepiness and have relatively few side effects. Sodium 
oxybate  (gamma  hydroxybutyrate),  given  at  bedtime  and  3–4  h 
later, is often very valuable in improving alertness, but it can pro-
duce excessive sedation, nausea, and confusion.

Cataplexy  is  usually  much  improved  with  antidepressants  that 
increase  noradrenergic  or  serotonergic  tone  because  these  neuro-
transmitters strongly suppress REM sleep and cataplexy. Venlafax-
ine  (37.5–150  mg  each  morning)  and  fluoxetine  (10–40  mg  each 
morning)  are  often  quite  effective.  The  tricyclic  antidepressants, 
such as protriptyline (10–40 mg/d) or clomipramine (25–50 mg/d) 
are potent suppressors of cataplexy, but their anticholinergic effects, 
including  sedation  and  dry  mouth,  make  them  less  attractive.1 
Sodium oxybate, twice each night, is also very helpful in reducing 
cataplexy.

1No  antidepressant  has  been  approved  by  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration 
(FDA) for treating narcolepsy.

 ■ EVALUATION OF INSOMNIA
Insomnia is the complaint of poor sleep and usually presents as diffi-
culty initiating or maintaining sleep. People with insomnia are dissat-
isfied with their sleep and feel that it impairs their ability to function 
well in work, school, and social situations. Affected individuals often 
experience fatigue, decreased mood, irritability, malaise, and cognitive 
impairment.

Chronic insomnia, lasting >3 months, occurs in about 10% of adults 
and is more common in women, older adults, people of lower socioeco-
nomic status, and individuals with medical, psychiatric, and substance 
abuse  disorders.  Acute  or  short-term  insomnia  affects  over  30%  of 
adults and is often precipitated by stressful life events such as a major 
illness or loss, change of occupation, medications, and substance abuse. 
If the acute insomnia triggers maladaptive behaviors such as increased 
nocturnal light exposure, frequently checking the clock, or attempting 
to sleep more by napping, it can lead to chronic insomnia.

Most  insomnia  begins  in  adulthood,  but  many  patients  may  be 
predisposed and report easily disturbed sleep predating the insomnia, 
suggesting  that  their  sleep  is  lighter  than  usual.  Clinical  studies  and 
animal  models  indicate  that  insomnia  is  associated  with  activation 
during  sleep  of  brain  areas  normally  active  only  during  wakefulness. 
The  polysomnogram  is  rarely  used  in  the  evaluation  of  insomnia,  as 
it  typically  confirms  the  patient’s  subjective  report  of  long  latency  to 
sleep and numerous awakenings but usually adds little new informa-
tion. Many patients with insomnia have increased fast (beta) activity in 
the EEG during sleep; this fast activity is normally present only during 
wakefulness,  which  may  explain  why  some  patients  report  feeling 
awake  for  much  of  the  night.  The  MSLT  is  rarely  used  in  the  evalu-
ation  of  insomnia  because,  despite  their  feelings  of  low  energy,  most 
people with insomnia do not easily fall asleep during the day, and on 
the MSLT, their average sleep latencies are usually longer than normal.
Many  factors  can  contribute  to  insomnia,  and  obtaining  a  careful 
history is essential so one can select therapies targeting the underlying 
factors. The assessment should focus on identifying predisposing, pre-
cipitating, and perpetuating factors.

Psychophysiological Factors  Many patients with insomnia have 
negative expectations and conditioned arousal that interfere with sleep. 
These individuals may worry about their insomnia during the day and 
have increasing anxiety as bedtime approaches if they anticipate a poor 
night of sleep. While attempting to sleep, they may frequently check the 
clock, which only heightens anxiety and frustration. They may find it 
easier to sleep in a new environment rather than their bedroom, as it 
lacks the negative associations.

Inadequate  Sleep  Hygiene  Patients  with  insomnia  sometimes 
develop counterproductive behaviors that contribute to their insomnia. 
These can include daytime napping that reduces sleep drive at night; 
an irregular sleep-wake schedule that disrupts their circadian rhythms; 
use of wake-promoting substances (e.g., caffeine, tobacco) too close to 
bedtime;  engaging  in  alerting  or  stressful  activities  close  to  bedtime 
(e.g., arguing with a partner, work-related emailing and texting while in 
bed, sleeping with a smartphone or tablet at the bedside); and routinely 
using  the  bedroom  for  activities  other  than  sleep  or  sex  (e.g.,  email,

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasestelevision,  work),  so  the  bedroom  becomes  associated  with  arousing 
or stressful feelings.

Psychiatric  Conditions  About  80%  of  patients  with  psychiatric 
disorders have sleep complaints, and about half of all chronic insomnia 
occurs in association with a psychiatric disorder. Depression is classi-
cally associated with early morning awakening, but it can also interfere 
with the onset and maintenance of sleep. Mania and hypomania can 
disrupt  sleep  and  often  are  associated  with  substantial  reductions  in 
the total amount of sleep. Anxiety disorders can lead to racing thoughts 
and rumination that interfere with sleep and can be very problematic 
if the patient’s mind becomes active midway through the night. Panic 
attacks can arise from sleep and need to be distinguished from other 
parasomnias.  Insomnia  is  common  in  schizophrenia  and  other  psy-
choses, often resulting in fragmented sleep, less deep NREM sleep, and 
sometimes reversal of the day-night sleep pattern.

Medications and Drugs of Abuse  A wide variety of psychoactive 
drugs can interfere with sleep. Caffeine, which has a half-life of 6–9 h, 
can disrupt sleep for up to 8–14 h, depending on the dose, variations in 
metabolism, and an individual’s caffeine sensitivity. Insomnia can also 
result from use of prescription medications too close to bedtime (e.g., 
antidepressants, stimulants, glucocorticoids, theophylline). Conversely, 
withdrawal of sedating medications such as alcohol, narcotics, or ben-
zodiazepines  can  cause  insomnia.  Alcohol  taken  just  before  bed  can 
shorten sleep latency, but it often produces rebound insomnia 2–3 h  
later  as  it  wears  off.  This  same  problem  with  sleep  maintenance  can 
occur with short-acting medications such as alprazolam or zolpidem.

Medical  Conditions  A  large  number  of  medical  conditions  dis-
rupt sleep. Pain from rheumatologic disorders or a painful neuropathy 
commonly disrupts sleep. Some patients may sleep poorly because of 
respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, cystic fibrosis, congestive heart failure, or restrictive lung dis-
ease, and some of these disorders are worse at night due to circadian 
variations  in  airway  resistance  and  postural  changes  in  bed  that  can 
result in nocturnal dyspnea. Many women experience poor sleep with 
the hormonal changes of menopause. Gastroesophageal reflux is also a 
common cause of difficulty sleeping.

Neurologic  Disorders  Dementia  (Chap.  29)  is  often  associated 
with poor sleep, probably due to a variety of factors, including napping 
during  the  day,  altered  circadian  rhythms,  and  perhaps  a  weakened 
output  of  the  brain’s  sleep-promoting  mechanisms.  In  fact,  insomnia 
and  nighttime  wandering  are  some  of  the  most  common  causes  for 
institutionalization  of  patients  with  dementia,  because  they  place  a 
larger  burden  on  caregivers.  Conversely,  in  cognitively  intact  elderly 
men,  fragmented  sleep  and  poor  sleep  quality  are  associated  with 
subsequent  cognitive  decline.  Patients  with  Parkinson’s  disease  may 
sleep poorly due to rigidity, dementia, and other factors. Fatal familial 
insomnia is a very rare neurodegenerative condition caused by muta-
tions in the prion protein gene (Chap. 438), and although insomnia is 
a  common  early  symptom,  most  patients  present  with  other  obvious 
neurologic  signs  such  as  dementia,  myoclonus,  dysarthria,  or  auto-
nomic dysfunction.

TREATMENT
Insomnia

Treatment  of  insomnia  improves  quality  of  life  and  can  promote 
long-term  health.  With  improved  sleep,  patients  often  report  less 
daytime fatigue, improved cognition, and more energy. Treating the 
insomnia  can  also  improve  comorbid  disease.  For  example,  man-
agement of insomnia at the time of diagnosis of major depression 
often improves the response to antidepressants and reduces the risk 
of relapse. Sleep loss can heighten the perception of pain, so a sim-
ilar approach is warranted in acute and chronic pain management.
The  treatment  plan  should  target  all  putative  contributing  fac-
tors:  establish  good  sleep  hygiene,  treat  medical  disorders,  use 
behavioral therapies for anxiety and negative conditioning, and use

pharmacotherapy  and/or  psychotherapy  for  psychiatric  disorders. 
Behavioral therapies should be the first-line treatment, followed by 
judicious use of sleep-promoting medications if needed. 
TREATMENT OF MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE
If the history suggests that a medical or psychiatric disease contrib-
utes to the insomnia, then it should be addressed by, for example, 
treating the pain or depression, improving breathing, and switching 
or adjusting the timing of medications. 
IMPROVE SLEEP HYGIENE
Attention should be paid to improving sleep hygiene and avoiding 
counterproductive,  arousing  behaviors  before  bedtime.  Patients 
should establish a regular bedtime and wake time, even on week-
ends,  to  help  synchronize  their  circadian  rhythms  and  sleep  pat-
terns. The amount of time allocated for sleep should not be more 
than their actual total amount of sleep. In the 30 min before bed-
time, patients should establish a relaxing “wind-down” routine that 
can include a warm bath, listening to music, meditation, or other 
relaxation  techniques.  The  bedroom  should  be  off-limits  to  com-
puters,  televisions,  radios,  smartphones,  videogames,  and  tablets. 
If an e-reader is used, the light should be adjusted for evening use 
(dimmer  and  reduced  blue  light)  if  possible,  because  light  itself, 
especially in the blue spectrum, suppresses melatonin secretion and 
is arousing. Once in bed, patients should try to avoid thinking about 
anything stressful or arousing such as problems with relationships 
or work. If they cannot fall asleep within 20 min, it often helps to 
get out of bed and read or listen to relaxing music in dim light as a 
form of distraction from any anxiety, but artificial light, including 
light from a television, cell phone, or computer, should be avoided.
Table  31-2  outlines  some  of  the  key  aspects  of  good  sleep 

hygiene to improve insomnia. 
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY
Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  uses  a  combination  of  the 
techniques  above  plus  additional  methods  to  improve  insomnia. 
A  trained  therapist  may  use  cognitive  psychology  techniques  to 
reduce excessive worrying about sleep and to reframe faulty beliefs 
about  the  insomnia  and  its  daytime  consequences.  The  therapist 
may also teach the patient relaxation techniques, such as progres-
sive muscle relaxation or meditation, to reduce autonomic arousal, 
intrusive thoughts, and anxiety. 
MEDICATIONS FOR INSOMNIA
If  insomnia  persists  after  treatment  of  these  contributing  factors, 
pharmacotherapy is often used on a nightly or intermittent basis. A 
variety of sedatives can improve sleep.

Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are the primary active 
ingredient  in  most  over-the-counter  sleep  aids.  These  may  be  of

benefit  when  used  intermittently  but  can  produce  tolerance  and 
anticholinergic  side  effects  such  as  dry  mouth  and  constipation, 
which limit their use, particularly in the elderly.

Benzodiazepine  receptor  agonists  (BzRAs)  are  an  effective  and 
well-tolerated  class  of  medications  for  insomnia.  BzRAs  bind  to 
the  GABAA  receptor  and  potentiate  the  postsynaptic  response  to 
GABA.  GABAA  receptors  are  found  throughout  the  brain,  and 
BzRAs may globally reduce neural activity and enhance the activity 
of  specific  sleep-promoting  GABAergic  pathways.  Classic  BzRAs 
include  lorazepam,  triazolam,  and  clonazepam,  whereas  newer 
agents such as zolpidem and zaleplon have more selective affinity 
for the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor.

Specific BzRAs are often chosen based on the desired duration 
of action. The most commonly prescribed agents in this family are 
zaleplon (5–20 mg), with a half-life of 1–2 h; zolpidem (5–10 mg) 
and triazolam (0.125–0.25 mg), with half-lives of 2–4 h; eszopiclone 
(1–3  mg),  with  a  half-life  of  5–8  h;  and  temazepam  (15–30  mg), 
with a half-life of 8–20 h. Generally, side effects are minimal when 
the dose is kept low and the serum concentration is minimized dur-
ing the waking hours (by using the shortest-acting effective agent). 
For chronic insomnia, intermittent use is recommended, unless the 
consequences of untreated insomnia outweigh concerns regarding 
chronic use.

The  heterocyclic  antidepressants  (trazodone,  amitriptyline,2  and 
doxepin) are the most commonly prescribed alternatives to BzRAs due 
to their lack of abuse potential and low cost. Trazodone (25–100 mg)  
is used more commonly than the tricyclic antidepressants, because 
it  has  a  much  shorter  half-life  (5–9  h)  and  less  anticholinergic 
activity.

The  orexin  receptor  antagonists  suvorexant  (10–20  mg)  and 
lemborexant  (5–10  mg)  can  also  improve  insomnia  by  blocking 
the  wake-promoting  effects  of  the  orexin  neuropeptides.  These 
have  long  half-lives  and  can  produce  morning  sedation,  and  as 
they reduce orexin signaling, they can rarely produce hypnagogic 
hallucinations and sleep paralysis (see narcolepsy section above).

Medications for insomnia are now among the most commonly 
prescribed  medications,  but  they  should  be  used  cautiously.  All 
sedatives  increase  the  risk  of  injurious  falls  and  confusion  in  the 
elderly, and therefore if needed these medications should be used 
at  the  lowest  effective  dose.  Morning  sedation  can  interfere  with 
driving  and  judgment,  and  when  selecting  a  medication,  one 
should  consider  the  duration  of  action.  Benzodiazepines  carry  a 
risk of addiction and abuse, especially in patients with a history of 
alcohol or sedative abuse. In patients with depression, all sedatives 
can  worsen  the  depression.  Like  alcohol,  some  sleep-promoting 
medications  can  worsen  sleep  apnea.  Sedatives  can  also  produce 
complex  behaviors  during  sleep,  such  as  sleepwalking  and  sleep 
eating, especially at higher doses.

2Trazodone  and  amitriptyline  have  not  been  approved  by  the  FDA  for  treating 
insomnia.

 ■ RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME
Patients  with  restless  legs  syndrome  (RLS)  report  an  irresistible  urge 
to move the legs. Many patients report a creepy-crawly or unpleasant 
deep ache within the thighs or calves, and those with more severe RLS 
may have discomfort in the arms as well. For most patients with RLS, 
these dysesthesias and restlessness are much worse in the evening and 
first  half  of  the  night.  The  symptoms  appear  with  inactivity  and  can 
make sitting still in an airplane or when watching a movie a miserable 
experience.  The  sensations  are  temporarily  relieved  by  movement, 
stretching,  or  massage.  This  nocturnal  discomfort  usually  interferes 
with  sleep,  and  patients  may  report  daytime  sleepiness  as  a  conse-
quence. RLS is very common, affecting 5–10% of adults, and is more 
common in women and older adults.

A  variety  of  factors  can  cause  RLS.  Iron  deficiency  is  the  most 
common treatable cause, and iron replacement should be considered 
if the ferritin level is <75 ng/mL. RLS can also occur with peripheral 

neuropathies and uremia and can be worsened by pregnancy, caffeine, 
alcohol,  antidepressants,  lithium,  neuroleptics,  and  antihistamines. 
Genetic factors contribute to RLS, and polymorphisms in a variety of 
genes  (BTBD9,  MEIS1,  MAP2K5/LBXCOR,  and  PTPRD)  have  been 
linked  to  RLS,  although  as  yet,  the  mechanism  through  which  they 
cause  RLS  remains  unknown.  Roughly  one-third  of  patients  (partic-
ularly those with an early age of onset) have multiple affected family 
members.

RLS  is  treated  by  addressing  the  underlying  cause  such  as  iron 
deficiency if present. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic, and dopa-
mine agonists or alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands are used most 
frequently.  Agonists  of  dopamine  D2/3  receptors  such  as  pramipexole 
(0.25–0.5 mg q7PM) or ropinirole (0.5–4 mg q7PM) are usually quite 
effective, but about 25% of patients taking dopamine agonists develop 
augmentation,  a  worsening  of  RLS  such  that  symptoms  begin  earlier 
in the day and can spread to other body regions. Other possible side 
effects  of  dopamine  agonists  include  nausea,  morning  sedation,  and 
increases  in  rewarding  behaviors  such  as  sex  and  gambling.  Alpha-
2-delta  calcium  channel  ligands  such  as  gabapentin  (300–600  mg  
q7PM) and pregabalin (150–450 mg q7PM) can also be quite effective; 
these are less likely to cause augmentation, and they can be especially 
helpful  in  patients  with  concomitant  pain,  neuropathy,  or  anxiety. 
Opioids and benzodiazepines may also be of therapeutic value. Most 
patients with restless legs also experience PLMD, although the reverse 
is not the case.

 ■ PERIODIC LIMB MOVEMENT DISORDER
PLMD  involves  rhythmic  twitches  of  the  legs  that  disrupt  sleep.  The 
movements resemble a triple flexion reflex with extensions of the great 
toe and dorsiflexion of the foot for 0.5–5.0 s, which recur every 20–40 s 
during NREM sleep, in episodes lasting from minutes to hours. PLMD 
is  diagnosed  by  a  polysomnogram  that  includes  recordings  of  the 
anterior tibialis and sometimes other muscles. The EEG shows that the 
movements of PLMD frequently cause brief arousals that disrupt sleep 
and can cause insomnia and daytime sleepiness. PLMD can be caused 
by the same factors that cause RLS (see above), and the frequency of leg 
movements improves with the same medications used for RLS, includ-
ing  dopamine  agonists.  Genetic  studies  identified  polymorphisms 
associated with both RLS and PLMD, suggesting that they may have a 
common pathophysiology.

 ■ PARASOMNIAS
Parasomnias  are  abnormal  behaviors  or  experiences  that  arise  from 
or  occur  during  sleep.  A  variety  of  parasomnias  can  occur  during 
NREM sleep, from brief confusional arousals to sleepwalking and night 
terrors.  The  presenting  complaint  is  usually  related  to  the  behavior 
itself, but the parasomnias can disturb sleep continuity or lead to mild 
impairments  in  daytime  alertness.  Two  main  parasomnias  occur  in 
REM sleep: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and nightmares.

Sleepwalking  (Somnambulism)  Patients  affected  by  this  dis-
order carry out automatic motor activities that range from simple to 
complex.  Individuals  may  walk,  urinate  inappropriately,  eat,  exit  the 
house,  or  drive  a  car  with  minimal  awareness.  It  may  be  difficult  to 
arouse the patient to wakefulness, and some individuals may respond 
to  attempted  awakening  with  agitation  or  violence.  In  general,  it  is 
safest  to  lead  the  patient  back  to  bed,  at  which  point  he  or  she  will 
often fall back asleep. Sleepwalking arises from NREM stage N3 sleep, 
usually in the first few hours of the night, and the EEG initially shows 
the slow cortical activity of deep NREM sleep even when the patient 
is moving about. Sleepwalking is most common in children and ado-
lescents,  when  deep  NREM  sleep  is  most  abundant.  About  15%  of 
children have occasional sleepwalking, and it persists in about 1% of 
adults.  Episodes  are  usually  isolated  but  may  be  recurrent  in  1–6% 
of patients. The cause is unknown, although it has a familial basis in 
roughly  one-third  of  cases.  Sleepwalking  can  be  worsened  by  stress, 
alcohol, and insufficient sleep, which subsequently causes an increase 
in deep NREM sleep. These should be addressed if present. Small stud-
ies have shown some efficacy of antidepressants and benzodiazepines;

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesrelaxation  techniques  and  hypnosis  can  also  be  helpful.  Patients  and 
their  families  should  improve  home  safety  (e.g.,  replace  glass  doors, 
remove low tables to avoid tripping) to minimize the chance of injury 
if sleepwalking occurs.

Sleep  Terrors  This  disorder  occurs  primarily  in  young  children 
during the first few hours of sleep during NREM stage N3 sleep. The 
child  often  sits  up  during  sleep  and  screams,  exhibiting  autonomic 
arousal with sweating, tachycardia, large pupils, and hyperventilation. 
The individual may be difficult to arouse and rarely recalls the episode 
on awakening in the morning. Treatment usually consists of reassuring 
parents  that  the  condition  is  self-limited  and  benign,  and  like  sleep-
walking, it may improve by avoiding insufficient sleep.

Sleep  Enuresis  Bedwetting,  like  sleepwalking  and  night  terrors, 
is  another  parasomnia  that  occurs  during  sleep  in  the  young.  Before 
age  5  or  6  years,  nocturnal  enuresis  should  be  considered  a  normal 
feature of development. The condition usually improves spontaneously 
by puberty, persists in 1–3% of adolescents, and is rare in adulthood. 
Treatment consists of bladder training exercises and behavioral ther-
apy. Symptomatic pharmacotherapy is usually accomplished in adults 
with desmopressin (0.2 mg qhs), oxybutynin chloride (5 mg qhs), or 
imipramine  (10–25  mg  qhs).  Important  causes  of  nocturnal  enuresis 
in  patients  who  were  previously  continent  for  6–12  months  include 
urinary tract infections or malformations, cauda equina lesions, emo-
tional disturbances, epilepsy, sleep apnea, and certain medications.

Sleep  Bruxism  Bruxism  is  an  involuntary,  forceful  grinding  of 
teeth during sleep that affects 10–20% of the population. The patient is 
usually unaware of the problem. The typical age of onset is 17–20 years, 
and  spontaneous  remission  usually  occurs  by  age  40.  In  many  cases, 
the  diagnosis  is  made  during  dental  examination,  damage  is  minor, 
and no treatment is indicated. In more severe cases, treatment with a 
mouth guard is necessary to prevent tooth injury. Stress management, 
benzodiazepines,  and  biofeedback  can  be  useful  when  bruxism  is  a 
manifestation of psychological stress.

REM  Sleep  Behavior  Disorder  (RBD)  RBD  (Video  31-2)  is 
distinct  from  other  parasomnias  in  that  it  occurs  during  REM  sleep. 
The  patient  or  the  bed  partner  usually  reports  agitated  or  violent 
behavior  during  sleep,  and  upon  awakening,  the  patient  can  often 
report  a  dream  that  matches  the  accompanying  movements.  During 
normal  REM  sleep,  nearly  all  nonrespiratory  skeletal  muscles  are 
paralyzed, but in patients with RBD, dramatic limb movements such 
as punching or kicking lasting seconds to minutes occur during REM 
sleep, and it is not uncommon for the patient or the bed partner to be 
injured.

The  prevalence  of  RBD  increases  with  age,  afflicting  about  2% 
of  adults  aged  >70,  and  is  about  twice  as  common  in  men.  Within  
12 years of disease onset, half of RBD patients develop a synucleinop-
athy such as Parkinson’s disease (Chap. 435) or dementia with Lewy 
bodies  (Chap.  434),  or  occasionally  multiple  system  atrophy  (Chap. 
440), and over 90% develop a synucleinopathy by 25 years. RBD can 
occur in patients taking antidepressants, and in some, these medica-
tions  may  unmask  this  early  indicator  of  neurodegeneration.  Synu-
cleinopathies  probably  cause  neuronal  loss  in  brainstem  regions  that 
regulate muscle paralysis during REM sleep, and loss of these neurons 
permits  movements  to  break  through  during  REM  sleep.  RBD  also 
occurs  in  about  30%  of  patients  with  narcolepsy,  but  the  underlying 
cause is probably different, as they seem to be at no increased risk of a 
neurodegenerative disorder.

Many  patients  with  RBD  have  sustained  improvement  with 
clonazepam (0.5–2.0 mg qhs).3 Melatonin at doses up to 9 mg nightly 
may also prevent attacks.
 ■ CIRCADIAN RHYTHM SLEEP DISORDERS
A  subset  of  patients  presenting  with  either  insomnia  or  hypersom-
nia may have a disorder of sleep timing rather than sleep generation. 

3No medications have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of RBD.

Disorders of sleep timing can be either organic (i.e., due to an abnor-
mality  of  circadian  pacemaker[s])  or  environmental/behavioral  (i.e., 
due  to  a  disruption  of  environmental  synchronizers).  Effective  ther-
apies  aim  to  entrain  the  circadian  rhythm  of  sleep  propensity  to  the 
appropriate behavioral phase.

Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder  DSWPD is characterized 
by:  (1)  sleep  onset  and  wake  times  persistently  later  than  desired; 
(2) actual sleep times at nearly the same clock hours daily; and (3) if 
conducted at the habitual delayed sleep time, essentially normal sleep 
on  polysomnography  (except  for  delayed  sleep  onset).  About  half  of 
patients  with  DSWPD  exhibit  an  abnormally  delayed  endogenous 
circadian  phase,  which  can  be  assessed  by  measuring  the  onset  of 
secretion of melatonin in either the blood or saliva; this is best done 
in  a  dimly  lit  environment  as  light  suppresses  melatonin  secretion. 
Dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) in DSWPD patients occurs later 
in the evening than normal, which is about 8:00–9:00 p.m. (i.e., about 
1–2 h before habitual bedtime). Patients tend to be young adults. The 
delayed  circadian  phase  could  be  due  to:  (1)  an  abnormally  long, 
genetically  determined  intrinsic  period  of  the  endogenous  circadian 
pacemaker;  (2)  reduced  phase-advancing  capacity  of  the  pacemaker; 
(3) slower buildup of homeostatic sleep drive during wakefulness; or 
(4) an irregular prior sleep-wake schedule, characterized by frequent 
nights  when  the  patient  chooses  to  remain  awake  while  exposed  to 
artificial  light  well  past  midnight  (for  personal,  social,  school,  or 
work reasons). In most cases, it is difficult to distinguish among these 
factors,  as  patients  with  either  a  behaviorally  induced  or  biologically 
driven circadian phase delay may both exhibit a similar circadian phase 
delay in DLMO, and both factors make it difficult to fall asleep at the 
desired hour. Late onset of dim-light melatonin secretion can help dis-
tinguish DSWPD from other forms of sleep-onset insomnia. DSWPD 
is a chronic condition that can persist for years and may not respond 
to attempts to reestablish normal bedtime hours. Treatment methods 
involving  phototherapy  with  blue-enriched  light  during  the  morning 
hours  and/or  melatonin  administration  in  the  evening  hours  show 
promise in these patients, although the relapse rate is high.

Advanced  Sleep-Wake  Phase  Disorder  Advanced  sleep-wake 
phase disorder (ASWPD) is the converse of DSWPD. Most commonly, 
this syndrome occurs in older people, 15% of whom report that they 
cannot sleep past 5:00 a.m., with twice that number complaining that 
they  wake  up  too  early  at  least  several  times  per  week.  Patients  with 
ASWPD are sleepy during the evening hours, even in social settings. 
Sleep-wake  timing  in  ASWPD  patients  can  interfere  with  a  normal 
social  life.  Patients  with  this  circadian  rhythm  sleep  disorder  can  be 
distinguished  from  those  who  have  early  wakening  due  to  insomnia 
because  ASWPD  patients  show  early  onset  of  dim-light  melatonin 
secretion.

In addition to age-related ASWPD, an early-onset familial variant of 
this condition has also been reported. In two families in which ASWPD 
was  inherited  in  an  autosomal  dominant  pattern,  the  syndrome  was 
due  to  missense  mutations  in  a  circadian  clock  component  (in  the 
casein  kinase  binding  domain  of  PER2  in  one  family,  and  in  casein 
kinase I delta in the other) that shortens the circadian period. Patients 
with ASWPD may benefit from bright light and/or blue enriched pho-
totherapy during the evening hours to reset the circadian pacemaker 
to a later hour.

Non-24-h  Sleep-Wake  Rhythm  Disorder  Non-24-h  sleep-
wake  rhythm  disorder  (N24SWD)  most  commonly  occurs  when  the 
primary synchronizing input (i.e., the light-dark cycle) from the envi-
ronment to the circadian pacemaker is lost (as occurs in many blind 
people  with  no  light  perception),  and  the  maximal  phase-advancing 
capacity  of  the  circadian  pacemaker  in  response  to  nonphotic  cues 
cannot accommodate the difference between the 24-h geophysical day 
and the intrinsic period of the patient’s circadian pacemaker, resulting 
in loss of entrainment to the 24-h day. The sleep of most blind patients 
with  N24SWD  is  restricted  to  the  nighttime  hours  due  to  social  or 
occupational  demands.  Despite  this  regular  sleep-wake  schedule, 
affected  patients  with  N24SWD  are  nonetheless  unable  to  maintain 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   213

21/01/22   3:37 PM

 
 
214

a  stable  phase  relationship  between  the  output  of  the  non-entrained 
circadian pacemaker and the 24-h day. Therefore, most blind patients 
present with intermittent bouts of insomnia. When the blind patient’s 
endogenous circadian rhythms are out of phase with the local environ-
ment, nighttime insomnia coexists with excessive daytime sleepiness. 
Conversely,  when  the  endogenous  circadian  rhythms  of  those  same 
patients are in phase with the local environment, symptoms remit. The 
interval between symptomatic phases may last several weeks to several 
months in blind patients with N24SWD, depending on the period of 
the  underlying  nonentrained  rhythm  and  the  24-h  day.  Nightly  low-
dose  (0.5  mg)  melatonin  administration  may  improve  sleep  and,  in 
some  cases,  induce  synchronization  of  the  circadian  pacemaker.  In 
sighted patients, N24SWD can be caused by self-selected exposure to 
artificial  light  that  inadvertently  entrains  the  circadian  pacemaker  to 
a  >24-h  schedule,  and  these  individuals  present  with  an  incremental 
pattern of successive delays in sleep timing, progressing in and out of 
phase  with  local  time—a  clinical  presentation  that  is  seldom  seen  in 
blind patients with N24SWD.

Shift-Work Disorder  More than 7 million workers in the United 
States regularly work at night, either on a permanent or rotating sched-
ule.  Many  more  begin  the  commute  to  work  or  school  between  4:00 
a.m. and 7:00 a.m., requiring them to commute and then work during 
a  time  of  day  that  they  would  otherwise  be  asleep.  In  addition,  each 
week, millions of “day” workers and students elect to remain awake at 
night or awaken very early in the morning to work or study to meet 
work  or  school  deadlines,  drive  long  distances,  compete  in  sporting 
events,  or  participate  in  recreational  activities.  Such  schedules  can 
result in both sleep loss and misalignment of circadian rhythms with 
respect to the sleep-wake cycle.

The circadian timing system usually fails to adapt successfully to the 
inverted  schedules  required  by  overnight  work  or  the  phase  advance 
required  by  early  morning  (4:00  a.m.  to  7:00  a.m.)  start  times.  This 
leads  to  a  misalignment  between  the  desired  work-rest  schedule  and 
the  output  of  the  pacemaker,  resulting  in  disturbed  daytime  sleep  in 
most  such  individuals.  Excessive  work  hours  (per  day  or  per  week), 
insufficient  time  off  between  consecutive  days  of  work  or  school, 
and  frequent  travel  across  time  zones  may  be  contributing  factors. 
Sleep  deficiency,  increased  length  of  time  awake  prior  to  work,  and 
misalignment  of  circadian  phase  impair  alertness  and  performance, 
increase reaction time, and increase risk of performance lapses, thereby 
resulting  in  greater  safety  hazards  among  night  workers  and  other 
sleep-deprived individuals. Sleep disturbance nearly doubles the risk of 
a fatal work accident. In addition, long-term night-shift workers have 
higher  rates  of  breast,  colorectal,  and  prostate  cancer  and  of  cardiac, 
gastrointestinal,  metabolic,  and  reproductive  disorders.  The  World 
Health Organization has added night-shift work to its list of probable 
carcinogens.

Sleep onset begins in local brain regions before gradually sweeping 
over  the  entire  brain  as  sensory  thresholds  rise  and  consciousness 
is  lost.  A  sleepy  individual  struggling  to  remain  awake  may  attempt 
to  continue  performing  routine  and  familiar  motor  tasks  during  the 
transition state between wakefulness and stage N1 sleep, while unable 
to adequately process sensory input from the environment. Such sleep- 
related attentional failures typically last only seconds but are known on 
occasion to persist for longer durations. Motor vehicle operators who 
fail  to  heed  the  warning  signs  of  sleepiness  are  especially  vulnerable 
to sleep-related accidents, as sleep processes can slow reaction times, 
induce automatic behavior, and intrude involuntarily upon the waking 
brain,  causing  catastrophic  consequences—including  6400  fatalities 
and 50,000 debilitating injuries in the United States annually. For this 
reason, an expert consensus panel has concluded that individuals who 
have  slept  <2  h  in  the  prior  24  h  are  unfit  to  drive  a  motor  vehicle. 
There is a significant increase in the risk of sleep-related, fatal-to-the-
driver highway crashes in the early morning and late afternoon hours, 
coincident with bimodal peaks in the daily rhythm of sleep tendency.

Physicians  who  work  prolonged  shifts,  especially  intermittent 
overnight  shifts,  constitute  another  group  of  workers  at  greater  risk 
for  accidents  and  other  adverse  consequences  of  lack  of  sleep  and 

misalignment  of  the  circadian  rhythm.  Recurrent  scheduling  of 
resident  physicians  to  work  shifts  of  ≥24  consecutive  hours  impairs 
psychomotor  performance  to  a  degree  that  is  comparable  to  alcohol 
intoxication,  doubles  the  risk  of  attentional  failures  among  inten-
sive  care  unit  resident  physicians  working  at  night,  and  significantly 
increases  the  risk  of  serious  medical  errors  in  intensive  care  units, 
including a fivefold increase in the risk of serious diagnostic mistakes. 
Some  20%  of  hospital  resident  physicians  report  making  a  fatigue- 
related  mistake  that  injured  a  patient,  and  5%  admit  making  a 
fatigue-related  mistake  that  resulted  in  the  death  of  a  patient.  More-
over, working for >24 consecutive hours increases the risk of percuta-
neous injuries and more than doubles the risk of motor vehicle crashes 
during  the  commute  home.  For  these  reasons,  in  2008,  the  National 
Academy  of  Medicine  concluded  that  the  practice  of  scheduling  res-
ident  physicians  to  work  for  >16  consecutive  hours  without  sleep  is 
hazardous for both resident physicians and their patients.

Of individuals scheduled to work at night or in the early morning 
hours,  5–15%  have  much  greater-than-average  difficulties  remaining 
awake during night work and sleeping during the day; these individu-
als are diagnosed with chronic and severe shift-work disorder (SWD). 
Patients with this disorder have a level of excessive sleepiness during 
work at night or in the early morning and insomnia during day sleep 
that  the  physician  judges  to  be  clinically  significant;  the  condition  is 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  sleep-related  accidents  and  with 
some  of  the  illnesses  associated  with  night-shift  work.  Patients  with 
chronic and severe SWD are profoundly sleepy at work. In fact, their 
sleep  latencies  during  night  work  average  just  2  min,  comparable  to 
mean  daytime  sleep  latency  durations  of  patients  with  narcolepsy  or 
severe sleep apnea.

TREATMENT
Shift-Work Disorder

Caffeine is frequently used by night workers to promote wakeful-
ness.  However,  it  cannot  forestall  sleep  indefinitely,  and  it  does 
not  shield  users  from  sleep-related  performance  lapses.  Postural 
changes, exercise, and strategic placement of nap opportunities can 
sometimes  temporarily  reduce  the  risk  of  fatigue-related  perfor-
mance  lapses.  Properly  timed  exposure  to  blue-enriched  light  or 
bright white light can directly enhance alertness and facilitate more 
rapid adaptation to night-shift work.

Modafinil (200 mg) or armodafinil (150 mg) 30–60 min before 
the  start  of  an  8-h  overnight  shift  is  an  effective  treatment  for 
the excessive sleepiness during night work in patients with SWD. 
Although  treatment  with  modafinil  or  armodafinil  significantly 
improves  performance  and  reduces  sleep  propensity  and  the  risk 
of  lapses  of  attention  during  night  work,  affected  patients  remain 
excessively sleepy.

Fatigue  risk  management  programs  for  night-shift  workers 
should  promote  education  about  sleep,  increase  awareness  of  the 
hazards associated with sleep deficiency and night work, and screen 
for  common  sleep  disorders.  Work  schedules  should  be  designed 
to minimize: (1) exposure to night work; (2) the frequency of shift 
rotations;  (3)  the  number  of  consecutive  night  shifts;  and  (4)  the 
duration of night shifts.

Jet  Lag  Disorder  Each  year,  >60  million  people  fly  from  one 
time zone to another, often resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness, 
sleep-onset insomnia, and frequent arousals from sleep, particularly in 
the latter half of the night. The syndrome is transient, typically lasting 
2–14 d depending on the number of time zones crossed, the direction 
of  travel,  and  the  traveler’s  age  and  phase-shifting  capacity.  Travelers 
who  spend  more  time  outdoors  at  their  destination  reportedly  adapt 
more  quickly  than  those  who  remain  in  hotel  or  seminar  rooms, 
presumably  due  to  brighter  (outdoor)  light  exposure.  Avoidance  of 
antecedent sleep loss or napping on the afternoon prior to overnight 
travel can reduce the difficulties associated with extended wakefulness. 
Laboratory  studies  suggest  that  low  doses  of  melatonin  can  enhance 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   214

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasessleep efficiency, but only if taken when endogenous melatonin concen-
trations are low (i.e., during the biologic daytime).

In addition to jet lag associated with travel across time zones, many 
patients report a behavioral pattern that has been termed social jet lag, 
in which bedtimes and wake times on weekends or days off occur 4–8 h 
later than during the week. Such recurrent displacement of the timing 
of  the  sleep-wake  cycle  is  common  in  adolescents  and  young  adults 
and  is  associated  with  delayed  circadian  phase,  sleep-onset  insom-
nia, excessive daytime sleepiness, poorer academic performance, and 
increased risk of both obesity and depressive symptoms.
 ■ MEDICAL IMPLICATIONS OF CIRCADIAN 
RHYTHMICITY
Prominent  circadian  variations  have  been  reported  in  the  incidence 
of acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke, the 
leading  causes  of  death  in  the  United  States.  Platelet  aggregability  is 
increased in the early morning hours, coincident with the peak inci-
dence  of  these  cardiovascular  events.  Recurrent  circadian  disruption 
combined with chronic sleep deficiency, such as occurs during night-
shift work, is associated with increased plasma glucose concentrations 
after  a  meal  due  to  inadequate  pancreatic  insulin  secretion.  Night-
shift  workers  with  elevated  fasting  glucose  have  an  increased  risk  of 
progressing  to  diabetes.  Blood  pressure  of  night  workers  with  sleep 
apnea is higher than that of day workers. A better understanding of the 
possible role of circadian rhythmicity in the acute destabilization of a 
chronic  condition  such  as  atherosclerotic  disease  could  improve  the 
understanding of its pathophysiology.

Diagnostic  and  therapeutic  procedures  may  also  be  affected  by 
the  time  of  day  at  which  data  are  collected.  Examples  include  blood 
pressure, body temperature, the dexamethasone suppression test, and 
plasma cortisol levels. The timing of chemotherapy administration has 
been reported to have an effect on the outcome of treatment. In addi-
tion, both the toxicity and effectiveness of drugs can vary with time of 
day.  For  example,  more  than  a  fivefold  difference  has  been  observed 
in mortality rates after administration of toxic agents to experimental 
animals at different times of day. Anesthetic agents are particularly sen-
sitive to time-of-day effects. Finally, the physician must be aware of the 
public health risks associated with the ever-increasing demands made 
by the 24/7 schedules in our round-the-clock society.

THE HUMAN VISUAL SYSTEM
The visual system provides a supremely efficient means for the rapid 
assimilation of information from the environment to aid in the guid-
ance of behavior. The act of seeing begins with the capture of images 
focused by the cornea and lens on a light-sensitive membrane in the 
back of the eye called the retina. The retina is actually part of the brain, 
banished to the periphery to serve as a transducer for the conversion 
of patterns of light energy into neuronal signals. Light is absorbed by 
pigment in two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. In the human 
retina, there are 100 million rods and 5 million cones. The rods oper-
ate in dim (scotopic) illumination. The cones function under daylight 
(photopic) conditions. The cone system is specialized for color percep-
tion and high spatial resolution. The majority of cones are within the 
macula, the portion of the retina that serves the central 10° of vision. 
In the middle of the macula, a small pit termed the fovea, packed exclu-
sively with cones, provides the best visual acuity.

Photoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light, activating bipolar, 
amacrine, and horizontal cells in the inner nuclear layer. After process-
ing of photoreceptor responses by this complex retinal circuit, the flow 
of sensory information ultimately converges on a final common path-
way: the ganglion cells. These cells translate the visual image impinging 
on the retina into a continuously varying barrage of action potentials 
that  propagates  along  the  primary  optic  pathway  to  visual  centers 
within the brain. There are a million ganglion cells in each retina and 
hence a million fibers in each optic nerve.

Ganglion cell axons sweep along the inner surface of the retina in 
the nerve fiber layer, exit the eye at the optic disc, and travel through 
the  optic  nerve,  optic  chiasm,  and  optic  tract  to  reach  targets  in  the 
brain. The majority of fibers synapse on cells in the lateral geniculate 
body,  a  thalamic  relay  station.  Cells  in  the  lateral  geniculate  body 
project in turn to the primary visual cortex. This afferent retinogenic-
ulocortical  sensory  pathway  provides  the  neural  substrate  for  visual 
perception.  Although  the  lateral  geniculate  body  is  the  main  target 
of  the  retina,  separate  classes  of  ganglion  cells  project  to  other  sub-
cortical  visual  nuclei  involved  in  different  functions.  Ganglion  cells 
that  mediate  pupillary  constriction  and  circadian  rhythms  are  light 
sensitive owing to a novel visual pigment, melanopsin. Pupil responses 
are mediated by input to the pretectal olivary nuclei in the midbrain. 
The pretectal nuclei send their output to the Edinger-Westphal nuclei, 
which in turn provide parasympathetic innervation to the iris sphinc-
ter via an interneuron in the ciliary ganglion. Circadian rhythms are

timed  by  a  retinal  projection  to  the  suprachiasmatic  nucleus.  Visual 
orientation and eye movements are served by retinal input to the supe-
rior colliculus. Gaze stabilization and optokinetic reflexes are governed 
by a group of small retinal targets known collectively as the brainstem 
accessory optic system.

The eyes must be rotated constantly within their orbits to place and 
maintain  targets  of  visual  interest  on  the  fovea.  This  activity,  called 
foveation, or looking, is governed by an elaborate efferent motor sys-
tem. Each eye is moved by six extraocular muscles that are supplied by 
cranial nerves from the oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), and abducens 
(VI)  nuclei.  Activity  in  these  ocular  motor  nuclei  is  coordinated  by 
pontine and midbrain mechanisms for smooth pursuit, saccades, and 
gaze  stabilization  during  head  and  body  movements.  Large  regions 
of the frontal and parietooccipital cortex control these brainstem eye 
movement centers by providing descending supranuclear input.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF VISUAL 
FUNCTION
 ■ REFRACTIVE STATE
In approaching a patient with reduced vision, the first step is to decide 
whether  refractive  error  is  responsible.  In  emmetropia,  parallel  rays 
from infinity are focused perfectly on the retina. Sadly, this condition 
is enjoyed by only a minority of the population. In myopia, the globe 
is too long, and light rays come to a focal point in front of the retina. 
Near objects can be seen clearly, but distant objects require a diverg-
ing lens in front of the eye. In  hyperopia, the globe is too short, and 
hence, a converging lens is used to supplement the refractive power of 
the eye. In astigmatism, the corneal surface is not perfectly spherical, 
necessitating a cylindrical corrective lens. Most patients elect to wear 
eyeglasses or contact lenses to neutralize refractive error. An alterna-
tive is to permanently alter the refractive properties of the cornea by 
performing  laser  in  situ  keratomileusis  (LASIK)  or  photorefractive 
keratectomy (PRK).

With the onset of middle age, presbyopia develops as the lens within 
the eye becomes unable to increase its refractive power to accommo-
date  on  near  objects.  To  compensate  for  presbyopia,  an  emmetropic 
patient must use reading glasses. A patient already wearing glasses for 
distance correction usually switches to bifocals. The only exception is a 
myopic patient, who may achieve clear vision at near simply by remov-
ing glasses containing the distance prescription.

Refractive errors usually develop slowly and remain stable after ado-
lescence, except in unusual circumstances. For example, the acute onset 
of diabetes mellitus can produce sudden myopia because of lens edema 
induced by hyperglycemia. Testing vision through a pinhole aperture 
is a useful way to screen quickly for refractive error. If visual acuity is 
better  through  a  pinhole  than  it  is  with  the  unaided  eye,  the  patient 
needs refraction to obtain best corrected visual acuity.
 ■ VISUAL ACUITY
The Snellen chart is used to test acuity at a distance of 6 m (20 ft). For 
convenience, a scale version of the Snellen chart called the Rosenbaum 
card is held at 36 cm (14 in.) from the patient (Fig. 32-1). All subjects 
should be able to read the 6/6 m (20/20 ft) line with each eye using their 
refractive correction, if any. Patients who need reading glasses because 
of presbyopia must wear them for accurate testing with the Rosenbaum 
card. If 6/6 (20/20) acuity is not present in each eye, the deficiency in 
vision  must  be  explained.  If  it  is  worse  than  6/240  (20/800),  acuity 
should be recorded in terms of counting fingers, hand motions, light 
perception,  or  no  light  perception.  Legal  blindness  is  defined  by  the 
Internal Revenue Service as a best corrected acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or 
less in the better eye or a binocular visual field subtending 20° or less. 
Loss of vision in one eye only does not constitute legal blindness. For 
driving, the laws vary by state, but most require a corrected acuity of 
6/12 (20/40) in at least one eye for unrestricted privileges. Patients who 
develop a homonymous hemianopia should not drive.
 ■ PUPILS
The pupils should be tested individually in dim light with the patient 
fixating on a distant target. There is no need to check the near response 

FIGURE  32-1  The  Rosenbaum  card  is  a  miniature,  scale  version  of  the  Snellen 
chart  for  testing  visual  acuity  at  near.  When  the  visual  acuity  is  recorded,  the 
Snellen distance equivalent should bear a notation indicating that vision was tested 
at near, not at 6 m (20 ft), or else the Jaeger number system should be used to report 
the acuity. (Design Courtesy J.G. Rosenbaum MD.)

if the pupils respond briskly to light, because isolated loss of constric-
tion (miosis) to accommodation does not occur. For this reason, the 
ubiquitous  abbreviation  PERRLA  (pupils  equal,  round,  and  reactive 
to  light  and  accommodation)  implies  a  wasted  effort  with  the  last 
step.  However,  it  is  important  to  test  the  near  response  if  the  light 
response  is  poor  or  absent.  Light-near  dissociation  occurs  with  neu-
rosyphilis (Argyll Robertson pupil), with lesions of the dorsal midbrain  
(Parinaud’s  syndrome),  and  after  aberrant  regeneration  (oculomotor 
nerve palsy, Adie’s tonic pupil).

An eye with no light perception has no pupillary response to direct 
light stimulation. If the retina or optic nerve is only partially injured, 
the direct pupillary response will be weaker than the consensual pupil-
lary response evoked by shining a light into the healthy fellow eye. A 
relative  afferent  pupillary  defect  (Marcus  Gunn  pupil)  is  elicited  with 
the swinging flashlight test (Fig. 32-2). It is an extremely useful sign 
in retrobulbar optic neuritis and other optic nerve diseases, in which 
it  may  be  the  sole  objective  evidence  for  disease.  In  bilateral  optic 
neuropathy, no afferent pupil defect is present if the optic nerves are 
affected equally.

Subtle  inequality  in  pupil  size,  up  to  0.5  mm,  is  a  fairly  common 
finding  in  normal  persons.  The  diagnosis  of  essential  or  physiologic 
anisocoria  is  secure  as  long  as  the  relative  pupil  asymmetry  remains 
constant as ambient lighting varies. Anisocoria that increases in dim 
light indicates a sympathetic paresis of the iris dilator muscle. The triad 
of  miosis  with  ipsilateral  ptosis  and  anhidrosis  constitutes  Horner’s

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesextremities.  This  benign  disorder,  which  occurs  predominantly  in 
healthy young women, is assumed to represent a mild dysautonomia. 
Tonic pupils are also associated with multiple system atrophy, segmen-
tal hypohidrosis, diabetes, and amyloidosis. Occasionally, a tonic pupil 
is discovered incidentally in an otherwise completely normal, asymp-
tomatic  individual.  The  diagnosis  is  confirmed  by  placing  a  drop  of 
dilute (0.125%) pilocarpine into each eye. Denervation hypersensitivity 
produces  pupillary  constriction  in  a  tonic  pupil,  whereas  the  normal 
pupil shows no response. Pharmacologic dilatation from accidental or 
deliberate instillation of anticholinergic (atropine, scopolamine) drops 
can produce pupillary mydriasis. Gardener’s pupil refers to mydriasis 
induced by exposure to tropane alkaloids, contained in plants such as 
deadly nightshade, jimsonweed, or angel’s trumpet. When an anticho-
linergic agent is responsible for pupil dilation, 1% pilocarpine causes 
no constriction.

Both pupils are affected equally by systemic medications. They are 
small  with  narcotic  use  (morphine,  oxycodone)  and  large  with  anti-
cholinergics (scopolamine). Parasympathetic agents (pilocarpine) used 
to treat glaucoma produce miosis. In any patient with an unexplained 
pupillary  abnormality,  a  slit-lamp  examination  is  helpful  to  exclude 
surgical trauma to the iris, an occult foreign body, perforating injury, 
intraocular  inflammation,  adhesions  (synechia),  angle-closure  glau-
coma, and iris sphincter rupture from blunt trauma.

 ■ EYE MOVEMENTS AND ALIGNMENT
Eye movements are tested by asking the patient, with both eyes open, to 
pursue a small target such as a pen tip into the cardinal fields of gaze. 
Normal ocular versions are smooth, symmetric, full, and maintained 
in all directions without nystagmus. Saccades, or quick refixation eye 
movements,  are  assessed  by  having  the  patient  look  back  and  forth 
between  two  stationary  targets.  The  eyes  should  move  rapidly  and 
accurately  in  a  single  jump  to  their  target.  Ocular  alignment  can  be 
judged by holding a penlight directly in front of the patient at about 
1  m.  If  the  eyes  are  straight,  the  corneal  light  reflex  will  be  centered 
in the middle of each pupil. To test eye alignment more precisely, the 
cover test is useful. The patient is instructed to look at a small fixation 
target in the distance. One eye is occluded with a paddle or hand, while 
the other eye is observed. If the viewing eye shifts position to take up 
fixation on the target, it was misaligned. If it remains motionless, the 
first  eye  is  uncovered  and  the  test  is  repeated  on  the  second  eye.  If 
neither eye moves, the eyes are aligned orthotropically. If the eyes are 
orthotropic in primary gaze but the patient complains of diplopia, the 
cover test should be performed with the head tilted or turned in what-
ever direction elicits diplopia. With practice, the examiner can detect 
an ocular deviation (heterotropia) as small as 1–2° with the cover test. 
In a patient with vertical diplopia, a small deviation can be difficult to 
detect and easy to dismiss. The magnitude of the deviation can be mea-
sured by placing a prism in front of the misaligned eye to determine the 
power required to neutralize the fixation shift evoked by covering the 
other eye. Temporary press-on plastic Fresnel prisms, prism eyeglasses, 
or eye muscle surgery can be used to restore binocular alignment.

 ■ STEREOPSIS
Stereoacuity is determined by presenting targets with retinal disparity 
separately  to  each  eye  by  using  polarized  images.  The  most  popular 
office tests measure a range of thresholds from 800 to 40 s of arc. Nor-
mal stereoacuity is 40 s of arc. If a patient achieves this level of stereo-
acuity, one is assured that the eyes are aligned orthotropically and that 
vision is intact in each eye. Random dot stereograms have no monoc-
ular depth cues and provide an excellent screening test for strabismus.

 ■ COLOR VISION
The  retina  contains  three  classes  of  cones,  with  visual  pigments  of 
differing peak spectral sensitivity: red (560 nm), green (530 nm), and 
blue (430 nm). The red and green cone pigments are encoded on the X 
chromosome, and the blue cone pigment on chromosome 7. Mutations 
of  the  blue  cone  pigment  are  exceedingly  rare.  Mutations  of  the  red 
and green pigments cause congenital X-linked color blindness in 8% of 
males. Affected individuals are not truly color blind; rather, they differ

FIGURE  32-2  Demonstration  of  a  relative  afferent  pupil  defect  (Marcus  Gunn 
pupil)  in  the  left  eye,  done  with  the  patient  fixating  on  a  distant  target.  A.  With 
dim  background  lighting,  the  pupils  are  equal  and  relatively  large.  B.  Shining 
a  flashlight  into  the  right  eye  evokes  equal,  strong  constriction  of  both  pupils. C. 
Swinging the flashlight over to the damaged left eye causes dilation of both pupils, 
although  they  remain  smaller  than  in  A.  Swinging  the  flashlight  back  over  to  the 
healthy  right  eye  would  result  in  symmetric  constriction  back  to  the  appearance 
shown in B. Note that the pupils always remain equal; the damage to the left retina/
optic nerve is revealed by weaker bilateral pupil constriction to a flashlight in the 
left eye compared with the right eye. (From P Levatin: Arch Ophthalmol 62:768, 1959.

syndrome, although anhidrosis is an inconstant feature. A drop of 1% 
apraclonidine produces no effect on the normal pupil, but the miotic 
pupil dilates because of denervation hypersensitivity. Brainstem stroke, 
carotid dissection, and neoplasm impinging on the sympathetic chain 
occasionally are identified as the cause of Horner’s syndrome, but most 
cases are idiopathic.

Anisocoria that increases in bright light suggests a parasympathetic 
palsy. The first concern is an oculomotor nerve paresis. This possibility 
is excluded if the eye movements are full and the patient has no ptosis or 
diplopia. Acute pupillary dilation (mydriasis) can result from damage 
to the ciliary ganglion in the orbit. Common mechanisms are infection 
(herpes  zoster,  influenza),  trauma  (blunt,  penetrating,  surgical),  and 
ischemia  (diabetes,  temporal  arteritis).  After  denervation  of  the  iris 
sphincter, the pupil does not respond well to light, but the response to 
near is often relatively intact. When the near stimulus is removed, the 
pupil redilates very slowly compared with the normal pupil, hence the 
term  tonic  pupil.  In  Adie’s  syndrome,  a  tonic  pupil  is  present,  some-
times in conjunction with weak or absent tendon reflexes in the lower

from  normal  subjects  in  the  way  they  perceive  color  and  how  they 
combine  primary  monochromatic  lights  to  match  a  particular  color. 
Anomalous trichromats have three cone types, but a mutation in one 
cone pigment (usually red or green) causes a shift in peak spectral sen-
sitivity, altering the proportion of primary colors required to achieve a 
color match. Dichromats have only two cone types and therefore will 
accept a color match based on only two primary colors. Anomalous tri-
chromats and dichromats have 6/6 (20/20) visual acuity, but their hue 
discrimination is impaired. Ishihara color plates can be used to detect 
red-green  color  blindness.  The  test  plates  contain  a  hidden  number 
that  is  visible  only  to  subjects  with  color  confusion  from  red-green 
color blindness. Because color blindness is almost exclusively X-linked, 
it is worthwhile screening only male children.

The Ishihara plates often are used to detect acquired defects in color 
vision,  although  they  are  intended  as  a  screening  test  for  congenital 
color  blindness.  Acquired  defects  in  color  vision  frequently  result 
from disease of the macula or optic nerve. For example, patients with 
a  history  of  optic  neuritis  often  complain  of  color  desaturation  long 
after their visual acuity has returned to normal. Color blindness also 
can  result  from  bilateral  strokes  involving  the  ventral  portion  of  the 
occipital  lobe  (cerebral  achromatopsia).  Such  patients  can  perceive 
only  shades  of  gray  and  also  may  have  difficulty  recognizing  faces 
(prosopagnosia)  (Chap.  30).  Infarcts  of  the  dominant  occipital  lobe 
sometimes give rise to color anomia. Affected patients can discriminate 
colors but cannot name them.

 ■ VISUAL FIELDS
Vision can be impaired by damage to the visual system anywhere from 
the eyes to the occipital lobes. One can localize the site of the lesion 
with considerable accuracy by mapping the visual field deficit by finger 
confrontation and then correlating it with the topographic anatomy of 
the visual pathway (Fig. 32-3). Quantitative visual field mapping is per-
formed by computer-driven perimeters that present a target of variable 
intensity at fixed positions in the visual field (Fig. 32-3A). By generat-
ing an automated printout of light thresholds, these static perimeters 
provide  a  sensitive  means  of  detecting  scotomas  in  the  visual  field. 
They are exceedingly useful for serial assessment of visual function in 
chronic diseases such as glaucoma and pseudotumor cerebri.

The  crux  of  visual  field  analysis  is  to  decide  whether  a  lesion  is 
before, at, or behind the optic chiasm. If a scotoma is confined to one 
eye, it must be due to a lesion anterior to the chiasm, involving either 
the  optic  nerve  or  the  retina.  Retinal  lesions  produce  scotomas  that 
correspond  optically  to  their  location  in  the  fundus.  For  example,  a 
superior-nasal retinal detachment results in an inferior-temporal field 
cut. Damage to the macula causes a central scotoma (Fig. 32-3B).

Optic nerve disease produces characteristic patterns of visual field 
loss. Glaucoma selectively destroys axons that enter the superotempo-
ral or inferotemporal poles of the optic disc, resulting in arcuate scoto-
mas shaped like a Turkish scimitar, which emanate from the blind spot 
and curve around fixation to end flat against the horizontal meridian 
(Fig. 32-3C). This type of field defect mirrors the arrangement of the 
nerve  fiber  layer  in  the  temporal  retina.  Arcuate  or  nerve  fiber  layer 
scotomas  also  result  from  optic  neuritis,  ischemic  optic  neuropathy, 
optic disc drusen, and branch retinal artery or vein occlusion.

Damage to the entire upper or lower pole of the optic disc causes an 
altitudinal field cut that follows the horizontal meridian (Fig. 32-3D). 
This pattern of visual field loss is typical of ischemic optic neuropathy 
but  also  results  from  retinal  vascular  occlusion,  advanced  glaucoma, 
and optic neuritis.

About half the fibers in the optic nerve originate from ganglion cells 
serving the macula. Damage to papillomacular fibers causes a cecocen-
tral scotoma that encompasses the blind spot and macula (Fig. 32-3E). 
If the damage is irreversible, pallor eventually appears in the temporal 
portion of the optic disc. Temporal pallor from a cecocentral scotoma 
may develop in optic neuritis, nutritional optic neuropathy, toxic optic 
neuropathy, Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, Kjer’s dominant optic 
atrophy, and compressive optic neuropathy. It is worth mentioning that 
the temporal side of the optic disc is slightly paler than the nasal side 
in  most  normal  individuals.  Therefore,  it  sometimes  can  be  difficult 

to decide whether the temporal pallor visible on fundus examination 
represents a pathologic change. Pallor of the nasal rim of the optic disc 
is a less equivocal sign of optic atrophy.

At the optic chiasm, fibers from nasal ganglion cells decussate into 
the  contralateral  optic  tract.  Crossed  fibers  are  damaged  more  by 
compression than are uncrossed fibers. As a result, mass lesions of the 
sellar region cause a temporal hemianopia in each eye. Tumors ante-
rior to the optic chiasm, such as meningiomas of the tuberculum sella, 
produce a junctional scotoma characterized by an optic neuropathy in 
one eye and a superior-temporal field cut in the other eye (Fig. 32-3G). 
More symmetric compression of the optic chiasm by a pituitary ade-
noma  (see  Fig.  380-1),  meningioma,  craniopharyngioma,  glioma,  or 
aneurysm results in a bitemporal hemianopia (Fig. 32-3H). The insid-
ious development of a bitemporal hemianopia often goes unnoticed by 
the patient and will escape detection by the physician unless each eye 
is tested separately.

It  is  difficult  to  localize  a  postchiasmal  lesion  accurately,  because 
injury anywhere in the optic tract, lateral geniculate body, optic radi-
ations, or visual cortex can produce a homonymous hemianopia (i.e., 
a  temporal  hemifield  defect  in  the  contralateral  eye  and  a  matching 
nasal hemifield defect in the ipsilateral eye) (Fig. 32-3I). A unilateral 
postchiasmal  lesion  leaves  the  visual  acuity  in  each  eye  unaffected, 
although the patient may read the letters on only the left or right half 
of the eye chart. Lesions of the optic radiations tend to cause poorly 
matched or incongruous field defects in each eye. Damage to the optic 
radiations  in  the  temporal  lobe  (Meyer’s  loop)  produces  a  superior 
quadrantic  homonymous  hemianopia  (Fig. 32-3J),  whereas  injury  to 
the optic radiations in the parietal lobe results in an inferior quadran-
tic  homonymous  hemianopia  (Fig.  32-3K).  Lesions  of  the  primary 
visual  cortex  give  rise  to  dense,  congruous  hemianopic  field  defects. 
Occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery supplying the occipital lobe 
is a common cause of total homonymous hemianopia. Some patients 
have  macular  sparing,  because  the  central  field  representation  at  the 
tip of the occipital lobe is supplied by collaterals from the middle cere-
bral artery (Fig. 32-3L). Destruction of both occipital lobes produces 
cortical blindness. This condition can be distinguished from bilateral 
prechiasmal  visual  loss  by  noting  that  the  pupil  responses  and  optic 
fundi remain normal.

Partial  recovery  of  homonymous  hemianopia  has  been  reported 
through  computer-based  rehabilitation  therapy.  During  daily  train-
ing  sessions,  patients  fixate  a  central  target  while  visual  stimuli  are 
presented  within  the  blind  region.  The  premise  of  vision  restoration 
programs  is  that  extra  stimulation  can  promote  recovery  of  partially 
damaged tissue located at the fringe of a cortical lesion. When fixation 
is controlled rigorously, however, no improvement of the visual fields 
can  be  demonstrated.  No  effective  treatment  exists  for  homonymous 
hemianopia caused by permanent brain damage.

DISORDERS
 ■ RED OR PAINFUL EYE
Corneal Abrasions  Corneal  abrasions  are  seen  best  by  placing  a 
drop of fluorescein in the eye and looking with the slit lamp, using a 
cobalt-blue light. A penlight with a blue filter will suffice if a slit lamp 
is not available. Damage to the corneal epithelium is revealed by yellow 
fluorescence of the basement membrane exposed by loss of the over-
lying epithelium. It is important to check for foreign bodies. To search 
the conjunctival fornices, the lower lid should be pulled down and the 
upper  lid  everted.  A  foreign  body  can  be  removed  with  a  moistened 
cotton-tipped  applicator  after  a  drop  of  a  topical  anesthetic  such  as 
proparacaine has been placed in the eye. Alternatively, it may be possi-
ble to flush the foreign body from the eye by irrigating copiously with 
saline  or  artificial  tears.  If  the  corneal  epithelium  has  been  abraded, 
antibiotic ointment and a patch may be applied to the eye. A drop of an 
intermediate-acting  cycloplegic  such  as  cyclopentolate  hydrochloride 
1% helps reduce pain by relaxing the ciliary body. The eye should be 
reexamined the next day. Minor abrasions may not require patching, 
antibiotics, or cycloplegia.

FIGURE 32-3  Ventral view of the brain, correlating patterns of visual field loss with the sites of lesions in the visual pathway. The visual fields overlap partially, creating 
120° of central binocular field flanked by a 40° monocular crescent on either side. The visual field maps in this figure were done with a computer-driven perimeter (Humphrey 
Instruments, Carl Zeiss, Inc.). It plots the retinal sensitivity to light in the central 30° by using a gray scale format. Areas of visual field loss are shown in black. The examples 
of common monocular, prechiasmal field defects are all shown for the right eye. By convention, the visual fields are always recorded with the left eye’s field on the left and 
the right eye’s field on the right, just as the patient sees the world.

Subconjunctival Hemorrhage  This results from rupture of small 
vessels bridging the potential space between the episclera and the con-
junctiva.  Blood  dissecting  into  this  space  can  produce  a  spectacular 
red eye, but vision is not affected and the hemorrhage resolves without 
treatment. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is usually spontaneous but can 
result  from  blunt  trauma,  eye  rubbing,  or  vigorous  coughing.  Occa-
sionally, it is a clue to an underlying bleeding disorder.

Pinguecula  Pinguecula is a small, raised conjunctival nodule, usu-
ally at the nasal limbus. In adults, such lesions are extremely common 

and  have  little  significance  unless  they  become  inflamed  (pinguecu-
litis). They are more apt to occur in workers with outdoor exposure. 
A  pterygium  resembles  a  pinguecula  but  has  crossed  the  limbus  to 
encroach on the corneal surface. Removal is justified when symptoms 
of irritation or blurring develop, but recurrence is common.

Blepharitis  This  refers  to  inflammation  of  the  eyelids.  The  most 
common form occurs in association with acne rosacea or seborrheic 
dermatitis. The eyelid margins usually are colonized heavily by staph-
ylococci.  Upon  close  inspection,  they  appear  greasy,  ulcerated,  and

crusted  with  scaling  debris  that  clings  to  the  lashes.  Treatment  con-
sists  of  strict  eyelid  hygiene,  applying  warm  compresses,  and  eyelash 
scrubs with baby shampoo. An external hordeolum (sty) is caused by 
staphylococcal infection of the superficial accessory glands of Zeis or 
Moll located in the eyelid margins. An internal hordeolum occurs after 
suppurative  infection  of  the  oil-secreting  meibomian  glands  within 
the  tarsal  plate  of  the  eyelid.  Topical  antibiotics  such  as  bacitracin/
polymyxin B ophthalmic ointment can be applied. Systemic antibiot-
ics, usually tetracyclines or azithromycin, sometimes are necessary for 
treatment of meibomian gland inflammation (meibomitis) or chronic, 
severe  blepharitis.  A  chalazion  is  a  painless,  chronic  granulomatous 
inflammation  of  a  meibomian  gland  that  produces  a  pealike  nodule 
within  the  eyelid.  It  can  be  incised  and  drained,  but  injection  with 
glucocorticoids is equally effective. Basal cell, squamous cell, or mei-
bomian  gland  carcinoma  should  be  suspected  with  any  nonhealing 
ulcerative lesion of the eyelids.

Dacryocystitis  An  inflammation  of  the  lacrimal  drainage  system, 
dacryocystitis  can  produce  epiphora  (tearing)  and  ocular  injection. 
Gentle pressure over the lacrimal sac evokes pain and reflux of mucus or 
pus from the tear puncta. Dacryocystitis usually occurs after obstruction 
of the lacrimal system. It is treated with topical and systemic antibiotics, 
followed by probing, silicone stent intubation, or surgery to reestablish 
patency.  Entropion  (inversion  of  the  eyelid)  or  ectropion  (sagging  or 
eversion of the eyelid) can also lead to epiphora and ocular irritation.

Conjunctivitis  Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red, 
irritated eye. Pain is minimal, and visual acuity is reduced only slightly. 
The  most  common  viral  etiology  is  adenovirus  infection.  It  causes  a 
watery  discharge,  a  mild  foreign-body  sensation,  and  photophobia. 
Bacterial  infection  tends  to  produce  a  more  mucopurulent  exudate. 
Mild  cases  of  infectious  conjunctivitis  usually  are  treated  empirically 
with broad-spectrum topical ocular antibiotics such as sulfacetamide 
10%,  polymyxin-bacitracin,  or  a  trimethoprim-polymyxin  combina-
tion. Smears and cultures usually are reserved for severe, resistant, or 
recurrent cases of conjunctivitis. To prevent contagion, patients should 
be admonished to wash their hands frequently, not to touch their eyes, 
and to avoid direct contact with others.

Allergic  Conjunctivitis  This  condition  is  extremely  common 
and often is mistaken for infectious conjunctivitis. Itching, redness, and 
epiphora  are  typical.  The  palpebral  conjunctiva  may  become  hypertro-
pic  with  giant  excrescences  called  cobblestone  papillae.  Irritation  from 
contact lenses or any chronic foreign body also can induce formation of 
cobblestone papillae. Atopic conjunctivitis occurs in subjects with atopic 
dermatitis or asthma. Symptoms caused by allergic conjunctivitis can be 
alleviated with cold compresses, topical vasoconstrictors, antihistamines 
(olopatadine),  and  mast  cell  stabilizers  (cromolyn).  Topical  glucocor-
ticoid  solutions  provide  dramatic  relief  of  immune-mediated  forms  of 
conjunctivitis, but their long-term use is ill advised because of the compli-
cations of glaucoma, cataract, and secondary infection. Topical nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; ketorolac) are better alternatives.

Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca  Also known as dry eye, this produces 
a burning foreign-body sensation, injection, and photophobia. In mild 
cases,  the  eye  appears  surprisingly  normal,  but  tear  production  mea-
sured by wetting of a filter paper (Schirmer strip) is deficient. A variety 
of  systemic  drugs,  including  antihistaminic,  anticholinergic,  and  psy-
chotropic medications, result in dry eye by reducing lacrimal secretion. 
Disorders  that  involve  the  lacrimal  gland  directly,  such  as  sarcoidosis 
and Sjögren’s syndrome, also cause dry eye. Patients may develop dry eye 
after radiation therapy if the treatment field includes the orbits. Prob-
lems with ocular drying are also common after lesions affecting cranial 
nerve  V  or  VII.  Corneal  anesthesia  is  particularly  dangerous,  because 
the absence of a normal blink reflex exposes the cornea to injury without 
pain  to  warn  the  patient.  Dry  eye  is  managed  by  frequent  and  liberal 
application of artificial tears and ocular lubricants. In severe cases, the 
tear puncta can be plugged or cauterized to reduce lacrimal outflow.

Keratitis  Keratitis is a threat to vision because of the risk of corneal 
clouding, scarring, and perforation. Worldwide, the two leading causes 

of blindness from keratitis are trachoma from chlamydial infection and 
vitamin A deficiency related to malnutrition. In the United States, con-
tact lenses play a major role in corneal infection and ulceration. They 
should not be worn by anyone with an active eye infection. In evaluating 
the cornea, it is important to differentiate between a superficial infection 
(keratoconjunctivitis) and a deeper, more serious ulcerative process. The 
latter is accompanied by greater visual loss, pain, photophobia, redness, 
and  discharge.  Slit-lamp  examination  shows  disruption  of  the  corneal 
epithelium, a cloudy infiltrate or abscess in the stroma, and an inflam-
matory  cellular  reaction  in  the  anterior  chamber.  In  severe  cases,  pus 
settles at the bottom of the anterior chamber, giving rise to a hypopyon. 
Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated after corneal 
scrapings are obtained for Gram’s stain, Giemsa stain, potassium hydrox-
ide  (KOH)  prep,  and  cultures.  Fortified  topical  antibiotics  are  most 
effective, supplemented with subconjunctival antibiotics as required. A 
fungal etiology should always be considered in a patient with keratitis. 
Fungal  infection  is  common  in  warm  humid  climates,  especially  after 
penetration of the cornea by plant or vegetable material. Acanthamoeba 
keratitis is associated with improper disinfection of contact lenses.

Herpes Simplex  The herpesviruses are a major cause of blindness 
from keratitis. Most adults in the United States have serum antibod-
ies  to  herpes  simplex,  indicating  prior  viral  infection  (Chap.  192). 
Primary  ocular  infection  generally  is  caused  by  herpes  simplex  type 
1 rather than type 2. It manifests as a unilateral follicular blepharocon-
junctivitis that is easily confused with adenoviral conjunctivitis, unless 
telltale  vesicles  are  present  on  the  eyelids  or  conjunctiva.  Recurrent 
ocular infection arises from reactivation of latent herpesvirus. A den-
dritic  pattern  of  corneal  epithelial  ulceration  revealed  by  fluorescein 
staining is pathognomonic for herpes infection but often not present. 
Involvement of both eyes is extremely rare. Corneal stromal inflamma-
tion produces edema, vascularization, and iridocyclitis. Herpes kerati-
tis is treated with cycloplegia and either a topical antiviral (trifluridine, 
ganciclovir) or an oral antiviral (acyclovir, valacyclovir) agent. Topical 
glucocorticoids  are  effective  in  mitigating  corneal  scarring  but  gen-
erally are reserved for cases involving stromal damage. Risks include 
corneal melting, perforation, prolonged infection, and glaucoma.

Herpes Zoster  Herpes zoster from reactivation of latent varicella 
(chickenpox)  virus  causes  a  dermatomal  pattern  of  painful  vesicular 
dermatitis  (Chap.  193).  Ocular  symptoms  can  occur  after  zoster 
eruption  in  any  branch  of  the  trigeminal  nerve  but  are  particularly 
common when vesicles form on the nose, reflecting nasociliary (V1) 
nerve  involvement  (Hutchinson’s  sign).  Herpes  zoster  ophthalmicus 
produces corneal dendrites, which can be difficult to distinguish from 
those seen in herpes simplex. Stromal keratitis, anterior uveitis, raised 
intraocular pressure, ocular motor nerve palsies, acute retinal necrosis, 
and postherpetic scarring and neuralgia are other common sequelae. 
Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is treated with antiviral agents and cyclo-
plegics. In severe cases, glucocorticoids may be added to prevent per-
manent visual loss from corneal scarring. Shingles should be prevented 
by vaccination of all healthy adults aged 50 years and older.

Episcleritis  This  is  an  inflammation  of  the  episclera,  a  thin  layer 
of  connective  tissue  between  the  conjunctiva  and  the  sclera.  Episc-
leritis resembles conjunctivitis, but it is a more localized process and 
discharge is absent. Most cases of episcleritis are idiopathic, but some 
occur  in  the  setting  of  an  autoimmune  disease.  Scleritis  refers  to  a 
deeper, more severe inflammatory process that frequently is associated 
with  a  connective  tissue  disease  such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis,  lupus 
erythematosus,  polyarteritis  nodosa,  granulomatosis  with  polyangi-
itis, or relapsing polychondritis. The inflammation and thickening of 
the sclera can be diffuse or nodular. In anterior forms of scleritis, the 
globe assumes a violet hue and the patient complains of severe ocular 
tenderness and pain. With posterior scleritis, the pain and redness may 
be less marked, but there is often proptosis, choroidal effusion, reduced 
motility, and visual loss. Episcleritis and scleritis should be treated with 
NSAIDs.  If  these  agents  fail,  topical  or  even  systemic  glucocorticoid 
therapy  may  be  necessary,  especially  if  an  underlying  autoimmune 
process is active.

Anterior Uveitis 
Involving the anterior structures of the eye, uvei-
tis  was  previously  called  iritis  or  iridocyclitis.  The  diagnosis  requires 
slit-lamp  examination  to  identify  inflammatory  cells  floating  in  the 
aqueous humor or deposited on the corneal endothelium (keratic pre-
cipitates). Anterior uveitis develops in sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondyli-
tis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, 
reactive arthritis, and Behçet’s disease. It also is associated with herpes 
infections, syphilis, Lyme disease, onchocerciasis, tuberculosis, and lep-
rosy. Although anterior uveitis can occur in conjunction with many dis-
eases, no cause is found to explain the majority of cases. For this reason, 
laboratory evaluation usually is reserved for patients with recurrent or 
severe  anterior  uveitis.  Treatment  is  aimed  at  reducing  inflammation 
and scarring by judicious use of topical glucocorticoids. Dilatation of 
the pupil reduces pain and prevents the formation of synechiae.

Posterior  Uveitis  This  diagnosis  is  made  by  observing  inflam-
mation of the vitreous, retina, or choroid on fundus examination. It is 
more likely than anterior uveitis to be associated with an identifiable 
systemic  disease.  Some  patients  have  panuveitis,  or  inflammation  of 
both  the  anterior  and  posterior  segments  of  the  eye.  Posterior  uvei-
tis  is  a  manifestation  of  autoimmune  diseases  such  as  sarcoidosis, 
Behçet’s disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, and inflammatory 
bowel  disease.  It  also  accompanies  diseases  such  as  toxoplasmosis, 
onchocerciasis,  cysticercosis,  coccidioidomycosis,  toxocariasis,  and 
histoplasmosis; infections caused by organisms such as Candida, Pneu-
mocystis carinii, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, herpes, and cytomegalovirus 
(see  Fig.  195-1);  and  other  diseases,  such  as  syphilis,  Lyme  disease, 
tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease, Whipple’s disease, and brucellosis. In 
multiple  sclerosis,  chronic  inflammatory  changes  can  develop  in  the 
extreme periphery of the retina (pars planitis or intermediate uveitis). 
Glucocorticoids have been the mainstay of treatment for noninfectious 
uveitis. Biologic agents that target proinflammatory cytokines, such as 
the  tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNF-α)  inhibitor  adalimumab,  are 
effective at preventing vision loss in chronic uveitis.

Acute  Angle-Closure  Glaucoma  This  is  an  unusual  but  fre-
quently  misdiagnosed  cause  of  a  red,  painful  eye.  Asian  populations 
have  a  particularly  high  risk  of  angle-closure  glaucoma.  Susceptible 
eyes have a shallow anterior chamber because the eye has either a short 
axial length (hyperopia) or a lens enlarged by the gradual development 
of  cataract.  When  the  pupil  becomes  mid-dilated,  the  peripheral  iris 
blocks aqueous outflow via the anterior chamber angle and the intraoc-
ular pressure rises abruptly, producing pain, injection, corneal edema, 
obscurations, and blurred vision. In some patients, ocular symptoms 
are  overshadowed  by  nausea,  vomiting,  or  headache,  prompting  a 
fruitless  workup  for  abdominal  or  neurologic  disease.  The  diagnosis 
is made by measuring the intraocular pressure during an acute attack 
or by performing gonioscopy, a procedure that allows one to observe 
a  narrow  chamber  angle  with  a  mirrored  contact  lens.  Acute  angle 
closure is treated with acetazolamide (PO or IV), topical beta block-
ers,  prostaglandin  analogues,  α2-adrenergic  agonists,  and  pilocarpine 
to induce miosis. If these measures fail, a laser can be used to create 
a  hole  in  the  peripheral  iris  to  relieve  pupillary  block.  Many  physi-
cians are reluctant to dilate patients routinely for fundus examination 
because they fear precipitating an angle-closure glaucoma. The risk is 
actually remote and more than outweighed by the potential benefit to 
patients of discovering a hidden fundus lesion visible only through a 
fully dilated pupil. Moreover, a single attack of angle closure after phar-
macologic  dilatation  rarely  causes  any  permanent  damage  to  the  eye 
and serves as an inadvertent provocative test to identify patients with 
narrow angles who would benefit from prophylactic laser iridectomy.

Endophthalmitis  This  results  from  bacterial,  viral,  fungal,  or 
parasitic  infection  of  the  internal  structures  of  the  eye.  It  usually  is 
acquired by hematogenous seeding from a remote site. Chronically ill, 
diabetic, or immunosuppressed patients, especially those with a history 
of indwelling IV catheters or positive blood cultures, are at greatest risk 
for endogenous endophthalmitis. Although most patients have ocular 
pain and injection, visual loss is sometimes the only symptom. Septic

liver transplant patient with candidemia from immunosuppression. 

emboli from a diseased heart valve or a dental abscess that lodge in the 
retinal  circulation  can  give  rise  to  endophthalmitis.  White-centered 
retinal hemorrhages known as Roth’s spots (Fig. 32-4) are considered 
pathognomonic  for  subacute  bacterial  endocarditis,  but  they  also 
appear  in  leukemia,  diabetes,  and  many  other  conditions.  Endoph-
thalmitis  occurs  as  a  complication  of  ocular  surgery,  especially  glau-
coma filtering, occasionally months or even years after the operation. 
An  occult  penetrating  foreign  body  or  unrecognized  trauma  to  the 
globe should be considered in any patient with unexplained intraocular 
infection or inflammation.

 ■ TRANSIENT OR SUDDEN VISUAL LOSS
Amaurosis Fugax  This term refers to a transient ischemic attack 
of  the  retina  (Chap.  427).  Because  neural  tissue  has  a  high  rate  of 
metabolism,  interruption  of  blood  flow  to  the  retina  for  more  than 
a  few  seconds  results  in  transient  monocular  blindness,  a  term  used 
interchangeably with amaurosis fugax. Patients describe a rapid fading 
of vision like a curtain descending, sometimes affecting only a portion 
of  the  visual  field.  Amaurosis  fugax  usually  results  from  an  embolus 
that becomes stuck within a retinal arteriole (Fig. 32-5). If the embolus 
breaks up or passes, flow is restored and vision returns quickly to nor-
mal without permanent damage. With prolonged interruption of blood 
flow, the inner retina suffers infarction. Ophthalmoscopy reveals zones 
of  whitened,  edematous  retina  following  the  distribution  of  branch 
retinal  arterioles.  Complete  occlusion  of  the  central  retinal  artery 

FIGURE 32-5  Hollenhorst plaque lodged at the bifurcation of a retinal arteriole proves

produces  arrest  of  blood  flow  and  a  milky  retina  with  a  cherry-red 
fovea  (Fig.  32-6).  Emboli  are  composed  of  cholesterol  (Hollenhorst 
plaque), calcium, or platelet-fibrin debris. The most common source 
is  an  atherosclerotic  plaque  in  the  carotid  artery  or  aorta,  although 
emboli  also  can  arise  from  the  heart,  especially  in  patients  with  dis-
eased valves, atrial fibrillation, or wall motion abnormalities.

In  rare  instances,  amaurosis  fugax  results  from  low  central  retinal 
artery perfusion pressure in a patient with a critical stenosis of the ipsi-
lateral carotid artery and poor collateral flow via the circle of Willis. In 
this situation, amaurosis fugax develops when there is a dip in systemic 
blood pressure or a slight worsening of the carotid stenosis. Sometimes 
there  is  contralateral  motor  or  sensory  loss,  indicating  concomitant 
hemispheric cerebral ischemia.

Retinal  arterial  occlusion  also  occurs  rarely  in  association  with 
retinal  migraine,  lupus  erythematosus,  anticardiolipin  antibodies, 
anticoagulant deficiency states (protein S, protein C, and antithrombin 
deficiency), Susac’s syndrome, pregnancy, IV drug abuse, blood dyscra-
sias, dysproteinemias, and temporal arteritis.

Marked  systemic  hypertension  causes  sclerosis  of  retinal  arterioles, 
splinter hemorrhages, focal infarcts of the nerve fiber layer (cotton-wool 
spots), and leakage of lipid and fluid (hard exudate) into the macula (Fig. 
32-7). In hypertensive crisis, sudden visual loss can result from ischemia 
induced by vasospasm of retinal arterioles. In addition, visual loss can 
occur from ischemic optic disc swelling. Patients with acute hypertensive 

retinopathy should be treated by lowering the blood pressure. However, 
the blood pressure should not be reduced precipitously, because there is 
a danger of optic disc infarction from sudden hypoperfusion.

Impending branch or central retinal vein occlusion can produce pro-
longed  visual  obscurations  that  resemble  those  described  by  patients 
with amaurosis fugax. The veins appear engorged and phlebitic, with 
numerous  retinal  hemorrhages  (Fig.  32-8).  In  some  patients,  venous 
blood  flow  recovers  spontaneously,  whereas  others  evolve  a  frank 
obstruction  with  extensive  retinal  bleeding  (“blood  and  thunder” 
appearance), infarction, and visual loss. Venous occlusion of the retina 
is often idiopathic, but hypertension, diabetes, and glaucoma are prom-
inent  risk  factors.  Polycythemia,  thrombocythemia,  or  other  factors 
leading  to  an  underlying  hypercoagulable  state  should  be  corrected; 
aspirin treatment may be beneficial.

Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)  This is caused 
by  insufficient  blood  flow  through  the  posterior  ciliary  arteries  that 
supply the optic disc. It produces painless monocular visual loss that 
is sudden in onset, followed sometimes by stuttering progression. The 
optic disc is edematous and usually bordered by nerve fiber layer splin-
ter hemorrhages (Fig. 32-9). AION is divided into two forms: arteritic 
and nonarteritic. The nonarteritic form is most common. No specific 
cause is known, although diabetes, renal failure, and hypertension are 
common  risk  factors.  Case  reports  have  linked  erectile  dysfunction

drugs to AION, but a causal association is doubtful. Evidence is strong 
that a crowded disc architecture and small optic cup predispose to the 
development  of  nonarteritic  AION.  In  patients  with  such  a  “disc-at-
risk,”  the  advent  of  AION  in  one  eye  increases  the  likelihood  of  the 
same  event  occurring  in  the  other  eye.  No  treatment  is  available  for 
nonarteritic AION; glucocorticoids should not be prescribed.

About 5% of patients, especially Caucasian females aged >60, have the 
arteritic form of AION in conjunction with giant cell (temporal) arteritis 
(Chap. 363). It is urgent to recognize arteritic AION so that high doses 
of glucocorticoids can be instituted immediately to prevent blindness in 
the second eye. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 
6  receptor,  is  an  effective  alternative  to  glucocorticoids  for  sustained 
suppression of symptoms of giant cell arteritis. Symptoms of polymyal-
gia rheumatica may be present; the sedimentation rate and C-reactive 
protein level are usually elevated. In a patient with visual loss from sus-
pected arteritic AION, temporal artery biopsy is mandatory to confirm 
the diagnosis. Administer glucocorticoids immediately, without waiting 
for the biopsy to be completed. The biopsy should be obtained as soon 
as  practical,  because  prolonged  glucocorticoid  treatment  can  hide 
inflammatory changes. It is important to harvest an arterial segment at 
least 3 cm long and to examine a sufficient number of tissue sections. 
The histologic features of granulomatous inflammation are often quite 
subtle in temporal artery specimens. If the biopsy is declared negative 
by an experienced pathologist, the diagnosis of arteritic AION is highly 
unlikely and glucocorticoids should usually be discontinued.

Posterior  Ischemic  Optic  Neuropathy  This  is  an  uncommon 
cause of acute visual loss, induced by the combination of severe anemia 
and hypotension. Cases have been reported after major blood loss dur-
ing surgery (especially in patients undergoing cardiac or lumbar spine 
operations),  shock,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  and  renal  dialysis.  The 
fundus usually appears normal, although optic disc swelling develops 
if the process extends anteriorly far enough to reach the globe. Vision 
can be salvaged in some patients by immediate blood transfusion and 
reversal of hypotension.

Optic  Neuritis  This  is  a  common  inflammatory  disease  of  the 
optic nerve. In the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), the mean 
age  of  patients  was  32  years,  77%  were  female,  92%  had  ocular  pain 
(especially with eye movements), and 35% had optic disc swelling. In 
most patients, the demyelinating event was retrobulbar and the ocular 
fundus appeared normal on initial examination (Fig. 32-10), although 
optic disc pallor slowly developed over subsequent months.

Virtually all patients experience a gradual recovery of vision after a 
single episode of optic neuritis, even without treatment. This rule is so 
reliable that failure of vision to improve after a first attack of optic neu-
ritis casts doubt on the original diagnosis. Treatment with high-dose 

IV  methylprednisolone  (250  mg  every  6  h  for  3  days)  followed  by 
oral prednisone (1 mg/kg per day for 11 days) makes no difference in 
ultimate  acuity  6  months  after  the  attack,  but  the  recovery  of  visual 
function  occurs  more  rapidly.  Therefore,  when  visual  loss  is  severe 
(worse  than  20/100),  IV  followed  by  PO  glucocorticoids  are  often 
recommended.

For  some  patients,  optic  neuritis  remains  an  isolated  event.  How-
ever,  the  ONTT  showed  that  the  15-year  cumulative  probability  of 
developing  clinically  definite  multiple  sclerosis  after  optic  neuritis 
is  50%.  A  brain  magnetic  resonance  (MR)  scan  is  advisable  in  every 
patient with a first attack of optic neuritis. If two or more plaques are 
present on initial imaging, treatment should be considered to prevent 
the development of additional demyelinating lesions (Chap. 444).

A particularly severe optic neuritis, often involving a long segment 
of  nerve,  occurs  in  neuromyelitis  optica  (NMO);  it  may  be  bilateral 
and  associated  with  myelitis.  NMO  can  occur  as  a  primary  disorder, 
in the setting of systemic autoimmune disease, or rarely, as a paraneo-
plastic condition. Detection of circulating antibodies directed against 
aquaporin-4 or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is diag-
nostic.  Treatment  for  acute  episodes  consists  of  glucocorticoids  fol-
lowed by satralizumab, eculizumab, or inebilizumab to prevent relapse. 
Neuromyelitis optica is discussed in detail in Chap. 445.
 ■ LEBER’S HEREDITARY OPTIC NEUROPATHY
This disease usually affects young men, causing progressive, painless, 
severe central visual loss in one eye, followed weeks to years later by 
the same process in the other eye. Acutely, the optic disc appears mildly 
plethoric with surface capillary telangiectasias but no vascular leakage 
on  fluorescein  angiography.  Eventually,  optic  atrophy  ensues.  Leber’s 
optic neuropathy is caused by a point mutation at codon 11778 in the 
mitochondrial gene encoding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehy-
drogenase (NADH) subunit 4. Additional mutations responsible for the 
disease have been identified, most in mitochondrial genes that encode 
proteins involved in electron transport. Mitochondrial mutations that 
cause Leber’s neuropathy are maternally inherited by all children, but 
for unknown reasons, only 10% of cases occur in females. Clinical trials 
of gene therapy for this condition have been unsuccessful.

Toxic Optic Neuropathy  This can result in acute visual loss with 
bilateral optic disc swelling and cecocentral scotomas. Cases have been 
reported  from  exposure  to  ethambutol,  methyl  alcohol  (moonshine), 
ethylene glycol (antifreeze), or carbon monoxide. In toxic optic neurop-
athy, visual loss also can develop gradually and produce optic atrophy 
(Fig. 32-11)  without  a  phase  of  acute  optic  disc  edema.  Many  agents 
have been implicated in toxic optic neuropathy, but evidence supporting 
the association is often weak. The following is a partial list of potential 
offending drugs or toxins: disulfiram, ethchlorvynol, chloramphenicol, 

FIGURE  32-10  Retrobulbar  optic  neuritis  is  characterized  by  a  normal  fundus 
examination initially, hence the rubric “the doctor sees nothing, and the patient sees 
nothing.” Optic atrophy develops after severe or repeated attacks. 

FIGURE 32-11  Optic atrophy is not a specific diagnosis but refers to the combination 
of optic disc pallor, arteriolar narrowing, and nerve fiber layer destruction produced 
by a host of eye diseases, especially optic neuropathies.

FIGURE  32-12  Papilledema  means  optic  disc  edema  from  raised  intracranial 
pressure. This young woman developed acute papilledema, with hemorrhages and 
cotton-wool spots, as a rare side effect of treatment with tetracycline for acne. 

FIGURE 32-13  Optic disc drusen are calcified, mulberry-like deposits of unknown 
etiology within the optic disc, giving rise to “pseudopapilledema.” 

amiodarone,  monoclonal  anti-CD3  antibody,  ciprofloxacin,  digitalis, 
streptomycin, lead, arsenic, thallium, d-penicillamine, isoniazid, eme-
tine, and sulfonamides. Metallosis (chromium, cobalt, nickel) from hip 
implant  failure  is  a  rare  cause  of  toxic  optic  neuropathy.  Deficiency 
states  induced  by  starvation,  malabsorption,  alcoholism,  or  gastric 
bypass  can  lead  to  insidious  visual  loss.  Thiamine,  vitamin  B12,  and 
folate levels should be checked in any patient with unexplained bilat-
eral central scotomas and optic pallor.

Papilledema  This  connotes  bilateral  optic  disc  swelling  from 
raised intracranial pressure (Fig. 32-12). Headache is a common but 
not invariable accompaniment. All other forms of optic disc swelling 
(e.g.,  from  optic  neuritis  or  ischemic  optic  neuropathy)  should  be 
called  “optic  disc  edema.”  This  convention  is  arbitrary  but  serves  to 
avoid confusion. Often it is difficult to differentiate papilledema from 
other forms of optic disc edema by fundus examination alone. Tran-
sient visual obscurations are a classic symptom of papilledema. They 
occur in only one eye or simultaneously in both eyes. They usually last 
seconds  but  can  persist  longer.  Obscurations  follow  abrupt  shifts  in 
posture  or  happen  spontaneously.  When  obscurations  are  prolonged 
or  spontaneous,  the  papilledema  is  more  threatening.  Visual  acuity 
is not affected by papilledema unless the papilledema is severe, long-
standing, or accompanied by macular edema and hemorrhage. Visual 
field  testing  shows  enlarged  blind  spots  and  peripheral  constriction 
(Fig.  32-3F).  With  unremitting  papilledema,  peripheral  visual  field 
loss progresses in an insidious fashion while the optic nerve develops 
atrophy. In this setting, reduction of optic disc swelling is an ominous 
sign of a dying nerve rather than an encouraging indication of resolv-
ing papilledema.

Evaluation  of  papilledema  requires  neuroimaging  to  exclude  an 
intracranial  lesion.  Noninvasive  MR  vascular  imaging  may  be  useful 
in selected cases to search for a dural venous sinus thrombosis or an 
arteriovenous shunt. If neuroradiologic studies are negative, the sub-
arachnoid  opening  pressure  should  be  measured  in  the  lateral  decu-
bitus position by lumbar puncture. Inaccurate pressure readings are a 
common pitfall. An elevated pressure, with normal cerebrospinal fluid, 
points by exclusion to the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic 
intracranial hypertension). Almost all patients are female, and most are 
obese. Treatment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazol-
amide lowers intracranial pressure by reducing the production of cere-
brospinal fluid and improves the visual fields. Weight reduction is vital: 
bariatric  surgery  should  be  considered  in  patients  who  cannot  lose 
weight by diet control. If vision loss is severe or progressive, a shunt 
should be performed without delay to prevent blindness. Placement of 
a stent across the junction of the transverse and sigmoid dural sinuses, 
where  stenosis  is  usually  present,  has  emerged  as  a  new  treatment 
option. Optic nerve sheath fenestration is a less effective approach and 

does not address other neurologic symptoms. Occasionally, fulminant 
papilledema produces rapid onset of blindness. In such patients, emer-
gency surgery should be performed to install a shunt.

Optic  Disc  Drusen  These  are  refractile,  glittering  particles  within 
the substance of the optic nerve head (Fig. 32-13). They are unrelated to 
drusen of the retina, which occur in age-related macular degeneration. 
Optic  disc  drusen  are  most  common  in  people  of  northern  European 
descent. Their diagnosis is obvious when they are visible on the surface 
of  the  optic  disc.  However,  in  many  patients,  they  are  hidden  beneath 
the surface, producing pseudopapilledema. It is important to recognize 
optic  disc  drusen  to  avoid  an  unnecessary  evaluation  for  papilledema. 
When optic disc drusen are buried, B-ultrasound is the most sensitive 
way  to  detect  them.  They  appear  hyperechoic  because  they  contain 
calcium. They are also visible on computed tomography (CT) or optical 
coherence  tomography  (OCT),  a  technique  for  acquiring  cross-section 
images of the retina. In most patients, optic disc drusen are an incidental, 
innocuous finding, but they can produce visual obscurations. On perim-
etry,  they  give  rise  to  enlarged  blind  spots  and  arcuate  scotomas  from 
damage to the optic disc. With increasing age, drusen tend to become 
more exposed on the disc surface as optic atrophy develops. Hemorrhage, 
choroidal neovascular membrane, and AION are more likely to occur in 
patients with optic disc drusen. No treatment is available.

Vitreous  Degeneration  This  occurs  in  all  individuals  with 
advancing  age,  leading  to  visual  symptoms.  Opacities  develop  in  the 
vitreous,  casting  annoying  shadows  on  the  retina.  As  the  eye  moves, 
these  distracting  “floaters”  move  synchronously,  with  a  slight  lag 
caused  by  inertia  of  the  vitreous  gel.  Vitreous  traction  on  the  retina 
causes  mechanical  stimulation,  resulting  in  perception  of  flashing 
lights. This photopsia is brief and is confined to one eye, in contrast to 
the bilateral, prolonged scintillations of cortical migraine. Contraction 
of  the  vitreous  can  result  in  sudden  separation  from  the  retina,  her-
alded by an alarming shower of floaters and photopsia. This process, 
known as vitreous detachment, is a common involutional event in the 
elderly. It is not harmful unless it damages the retina. A careful exami-
nation of the dilated fundus is important in any patient complaining 
of floaters or photopsia to search for peripheral tears or holes. If such 
a lesion is found, laser application can forestall a retinal detachment. 
Occasionally  a  tear  ruptures  a  retinal  blood  vessel,  causing  vitreous 
hemorrhage and sudden loss of vision. On attempted ophthalmoscopy 
the fundus is hidden by a dark haze of blood. Ultrasound is required 
to examine the interior of the eye for a retinal tear or detachment. If 
the  hemorrhage  does  not  resolve  spontaneously,  the  vitreous  can  be 
removed surgically. Vitreous hemorrhage also results from the fragile 
neovascular vessels that proliferate on the surface of the retina in dia-
betes, sickle cell anemia, and other ischemic ocular diseases.

claimed  by  hysterics  or  malingerers.  The  latter  account  for  the  vast 
majority,  seeking  sympathy,  special  treatment,  or  financial  gain  by 
feigning loss of sight. The diagnosis is suspected when the history is 
atypical, physical findings are lacking or contradictory, inconsistencies 
emerge  on  testing,  and  a  secondary  motive  can  be  identified.  In  our 
litigious society, the fraudulent pursuit of recompense has spawned an 
epidemic of factitious visual loss.

 ■ CHRONIC VISUAL LOSS
Cataract  Cataract  is  a  clouding  of  the  lens  sufficient  to  reduce 
vision.  Most  cataracts  develop  slowly  as  a  result  of  aging,  leading  to 
gradual impairment of vision. The formation of cataract occurs more 
rapidly  in  patients  with  a  history  of  uveitis,  diabetes  mellitus,  ocular 
trauma,  or  vitrectomy.  Cataracts  are  acquired  in  a  variety  of  genetic 
diseases,  such  as  myotonic  dystrophy,  neurofibromatosis  type  2,  and 
galactosemia.  Radiation  therapy  and  glucocorticoid  treatment  can 
induce cataract as a side effect. The cataracts associated with radiation 
or glucocorticoids have a typical posterior subcapsular location. Cat-
aract can be detected by noting an impaired red reflex when viewing 
light reflected from the fundus with an ophthalmoscope or by examin-
ing the dilated eye with the slit lamp.

The only treatment for cataract is surgical extraction of the opacified 
lens. Millions of cataract operations are performed each year around 
the globe. The operation generally is done under local anesthesia on an 
outpatient basis. A plastic or silicone intraocular lens is placed within 
the empty lens capsule in the posterior chamber, substituting for the 
natural lens and leading to rapid recovery of sight. More than 95% of 
patients who undergo cataract extraction can expect an improvement 
in vision. In some patients, the lens capsule remaining in the eye after 
cataract extraction eventually turns cloudy, causing secondary loss of 
vision. A small opening, called a posterior capsulotomy, is made in the 
lens capsule with a laser to restore clarity.

Glaucoma  Glaucoma is a slowly progressive, insidious optic neur-
opathy that usually is associated with chronic elevation of intraocular 
pressure. After cataract, it is the most common cause of blindness in 
the world. It is especially prevalent in people of African descent. The 
mechanism  by  which  raised  intraocular  pressure  injures  the  optic 
nerve  is  not  understood.  Axons  entering  the  inferotemporal  and 
superotemporal aspects of the optic disc are damaged first, producing 
typical nerve fiber bundle defects called arcuate scotomas. As fibers are 
destroyed, the neural rim of the optic disc shrinks and the physiologic 
cup within the optic disc enlarges (Fig. 32-15). This process is referred 
to  as  pathologic  “cupping.”  The  cup-to-disc  diameter  is  expressed  as 
a  fraction  (e.g.,  0.2).  The  cup-to-disc  ratio  ranges  widely  in  normal 
individuals, making it difficult to diagnose glaucoma reliably simply by 

FIGURE 32-15  Glaucoma results in “cupping” as the neural rim is destroyed and 
the central cup becomes enlarged and excavated. The cup-to-disc ratio is about 
0.8 in this patient. 

FIGURE 32-14  Retinal detachment appears as an elevated sheet of retinal tissue 
with  folds.  In  this  patient,  the  fovea  was  spared,  so  acuity  was  normal,  but  an 
inferior detachment produced a superior scotoma. 

Retinal Detachment  This produces symptoms of floaters, flashing 
lights, and a scotoma in the peripheral visual field corresponding to the 
detachment (Fig. 32-14). If the detachment includes the fovea, there is 
an afferent pupil defect and the visual acuity is reduced. In most eyes, 
retinal  detachment  starts  with  a  hole,  flap,  or  tear  in  the  peripheral 
retina (rhegmatogenous retinal detachment). Patients with peripheral 
retinal  thinning  (lattice  degeneration)  are  particularly  vulnerable  to 
this  process.  Once  a  break  has  developed  in  the  retina,  liquefied  vit-
reous is free to enter the subretinal space, separating the retina from 
the pigment epithelium. The combination of vitreous traction on the 
retinal surface and passage of fluid behind the retina leads inexorably 
to detachment. Patients with a history of myopia, trauma, or prior cata-
ract extraction are at greatest risk for retinal detachment. The diagnosis 
is confirmed by ophthalmoscopic examination of the dilated eye.

Classic Migraine 
(See  also  Chap.  430)  This  usually  occurs  with 
a visual aura lasting about 20 min. In a typical attack, a small central 
disturbance in the field of vision marches toward the periphery, leaving 
a  transient  scotoma  in  its  wake.  The  expanding  border  of  migraine 
scotoma  has  a  scintillating,  dancing,  or  zigzag  edge,  resembling  the 
bastions of a fortified city, hence the term fortification spectra. Patients’ 
descriptions of fortification spectra vary widely and can be confused 
with  amaurosis  fugax.  Migraine  patterns  usually  last  longer  and  are 
perceived in both eyes, whereas amaurosis fugax is briefer and occurs 
in only one eye. Migraine phenomena also remain visible in the dark 
or with the eyes closed. Generally, they are confined to either the right 
or  the  left  visual  hemifield,  but  sometimes,  both  fields  are  involved 
simultaneously. Patients often have a long history of stereotypic attacks. 
After the visual symptoms recede, headache develops in most patients.

Transient  Ischemic  Attacks  Vertebrobasilar  insufficiency  may 
result  in  acute  homonymous  visual  symptoms.  Many  patients  mis-
takenly  describe  symptoms  in  the  left  or  right  eye  when  in  fact  the 
symptoms are occurring in the left or right hemifield of both eyes. Inter-
ruption of blood supply to the visual cortex causes a sudden fogging or 
graying  of  vision,  occasionally  with  flashing  lights  or  other  positive 
phenomena that mimic migraine. Cortical ischemic attacks are briefer 
in duration than migraine, occur in older patients, and are not followed 
by headache. There may be associated signs of brainstem ischemia, such 
as diplopia, vertigo, numbness, weakness, and dysarthria.

Stroke  Stroke  occurs  when  interruption  of  blood  supply  from  the 
posterior  cerebral  artery  to  the  visual  cortex  is  prolonged.  The  only 
finding on examination is a homonymous visual field defect that stops 
abruptly at the vertical meridian. Occipital lobe stroke usually is due to 
thrombotic occlusion of the vertebrobasilar system, embolus, or dissec-
tion.  Lobar  hemorrhage,  tumor,  abscess,  and  arteriovenous  malforma-
tion are other common causes of hemianopic cortical visual loss.

observing an unusually large or deep optic cup. Careful documentation 
of serial examinations is helpful. In a patient with physiologic cupping, 
the  large  cup  remains  stable,  whereas  in  a  patient  with  glaucoma,  it 
expands relentlessly over the years. Observation of progressive cupping 
and detection of an arcuate scotoma or a nasal step on computerized 
visual field testing is sufficient to establish the diagnosis of glaucoma. 
OCT reveals corresponding loss of fibers along the arcuate pathways 
in the nerve fiber layer.

The  preponderance  of  patients  with  glaucoma  have  open  anterior 
chamber angles. In most affected individuals, the intraocular pressure 
is elevated. The cause of elevated intraocular pressure is unknown, but 
it  is  associated  with  gene  mutations  in  the  heritable  forms.  Surpris-
ingly, a third of patients with open-angle glaucoma have an intraocular 
pressure within the normal range of 10–20 mmHg. For this so-called 
normal or low-tension form of glaucoma, high myopia is a risk factor.
Chronic angle-closure glaucoma and chronic open-angle glaucoma are 
usually asymptomatic. Only acute angle-closure glaucoma causes a red or 
painful eye, from abrupt elevation of intraocular pressure. In all forms of 
glaucoma, foveal acuity is spared until end-stage disease is reached. For 
these reasons, severe and irreversible damage can occur before either the 
patient or the physician recognizes the diagnosis. Screening of patients 
for glaucoma by noting the cup-to-disc ratio on ophthalmoscopy and by 
measuring intraocular pressure is vital. Glaucoma is treated with topical 
adrenergic  agonists,  cholinergic  agonists,  beta  blockers,  prostaglandin 
analogues,  and  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors.  Occasionally,  systemic 
absorption  of  beta  blocker  from  eyedrops  can  be  sufficient  to  cause 
side effects of bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, bronchospasm, or 
depression. Laser treatment of the trabecular meshwork in the anterior 
chamber  angle  improves  aqueous  outflow  from  the  eye.  If  medical  or 
laser treatments fail to halt optic nerve damage from glaucoma, a filter 
must  be  constructed  surgically  (trabeculectomy)  or  a  drainage  device 
placed to release aqueous from the eye in a controlled fashion.

Macular Degeneration  This is a major cause of gradual, painless, 
bilateral  central  visual  loss  in  the  elderly.  It  occurs  in  a  nonexudative 
(dry) form and an exudative (wet) form. Inflammation may be impor-
tant in both forms of macular degeneration; susceptibility is associated 
with variants in the gene for complement factor H, an inhibitor of the 
alternative complement pathway. The nonexudative process begins with 
the accumulation of extracellular deposits called drusen underneath the 
retinal pigment epithelium. On ophthalmoscopy, they are pleomorphic 
but  generally  appear  as  small  discrete  yellow  lesions  clustered  in  the 
macula  (Fig.  32-16).  With  time,  they  become  larger,  more  numer-
ous,  and  confluent.  The  retinal  pigment  epithelium  becomes  focally 
detached and atrophic, causing visual loss by interfering with photore-
ceptor function. Treatment with vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and 
zinc may retard dry macular degeneration.

Exudative macular degeneration, which develops in only a minority 
of  patients,  occurs  when  neovascular  vessels  from  the  choroid  grow 
through defects in Bruch’s membrane and proliferate underneath the 
retinal  pigment  epithelium  or  the  retina.  Leakage  from  these  vessels 
produces  elevation  of  the  retina,  with  distortion  (metamorphopsia) 
and blurring of vision. Although the onset of these symptoms is usually 
gradual, bleeding from a subretinal choroidal neovascular membrane 
sometimes  causes  acute  visual  loss.  Neovascular  membranes  can  be 
difficult to see on fundus examination because they are located beneath 
the retina. Fluorescein angiography and OCT are extremely useful for 
their detection. Major or repeated hemorrhage under the retina from 
neovascular  membranes  results  in  fibrosis,  development  of  a  round 
(disciform) macular scar, and permanent loss of central vision.

A major therapeutic advance has occurred with the discovery that 
exudative macular degeneration can be treated with intraocular injec-
tion of antagonists to vascular endothelial growth factor. Bevacizumab, 
ranibizumab,  aflibercept,  or  brolucizumab  is  administered  by  direct 
injection into the vitreous cavity, beginning on a monthly basis. These 
antibodies cause the regression of neovascular membranes by blocking 
the  action  of  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor,  thereby  improving 
visual acuity.

Central Serous Chorioretinopathy  This primarily affects males 
between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Leakage of serous fluid from the 
choroid causes small, localized detachment of the retinal pigment epi-
thelium and the neurosensory retina. These detachments produce acute 
or chronic symptoms of metamorphopsia and blurred vision when the 
macula is involved. They are difficult to visualize with a direct ophthal-
moscope  because  the  detached  retina  is  transparent  and  only  slightly 
elevated. OCT shows fluid beneath the retina, and fluorescein angiogra-
phy shows dye streaming into the subretinal space. The cause of central 
serous chorioretinopathy is unknown. Symptoms may resolve sponta-
neously if the retina reattaches, but recurrent detachment is common. 
Laser photocoagulation has benefited some patients with this condition.

Diabetic Retinopathy  A rare disease until 1921, when the discov-
ery of insulin resulted in a dramatic improvement in life expectancy for 
patients with diabetes mellitus, diabetic retinopathy is now a leading 
cause  of  blindness  in  the  United  States.  The  retinopathy  takes  years 
to develop but eventually appears in nearly all cases. Regular surveil-
lance of the dilated fundus is crucial for any patient with diabetes. In 
advanced diabetic retinopathy, the proliferation of neovascular vessels 
leads to blindness from vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and 
glaucoma  (Fig.  32-17).  These  complications  can  be  avoided  in  most 
patients  by  administration  of  panretinal  laser  photocoagulation  at 
the  appropriate  point  in  the  evolution  of  the  disease.  Anti-vascular

FIGURE 32-18  Retinitis pigmentosa with black clumps of pigment known as “bone 
spicules.”  The  patient  had  peripheral  visual  field  loss  with  sparing  of  central 
(macular) vision. 

endothelial growth factor antibody treatment is equally effective, but 
intraocular injections must be given repeatedly. For further discussion 
of the manifestations and management of diabetic retinopathy, see 
Chaps. 403–405.

Retinitis Pigmentosa  This is a general term for a disparate group 
of rod-cone dystrophies characterized by progressive night blindness, 
visual  field  constriction  with  a  ring  scotoma,  loss  of  acuity,  and  an 
abnormal  electroretinogram  (ERG).  It  occurs  sporadically  or  in  an 
autosomal  recessive,  dominant,  or  X-linked  pattern.  Irregular  black 
deposits of clumped pigment in the peripheral retina, called bone spic-
ules because of their vague resemblance to the spicules of cancellous 
bone,  give  the  disease  its  name  (Fig.  32-18).  The  name  is  actually  a 
misnomer because retinitis pigmentosa is not an inflammatory process. 
Genetic testing usually identifies a mutation in the gene for rhodopsin, 
the  rod  photopigment,  or  in  the  gene  for  peripherin,  a  glycoprotein 
located  in  photoreceptor  outer  segments.  Vitamin  A  (15,000  IU/d) 
slightly retards the deterioration of the ERG in patients with retinitis 
pigmentosa but has no beneficial effect on visual acuity or fields.

Leber’s congenital amaurosis, a rare cone dystrophy, has been treated 
by  replacement  of  the  missing  RPE65  protein  through  gene  therapy, 
resulting  in  slight  improvement  in  visual  function.  Some  forms  of 
retinitis pigmentosa occur in association with rare, hereditary systemic 
diseases  (olivopontocerebellar  degeneration,  Bassen-Kornzweig  dis-
ease,  Kearns-Sayre  syndrome,  Refsum’s  disease).  Chronic  treatment 
with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and phenothiazines (especially 
thioridazine)  can  produce  visual  loss  from  a  toxic  retinopathy  that 
resembles retinitis pigmentosa. Patients receiving long-term treatment 
with hydroxychloroquine require regular eye examinations to monitor 
for potential development of a bull’s eye maculopathy.

Epiretinal Membrane  This is a fibrocellular tissue that grows across 
the  inner  surface  of  the  retina,  causing  metamorphopsia  and  reduced 
visual acuity from distortion of the macula. A crinkled, cellophane-like 
membrane is visible on the retinal examination. Epiretinal membrane is 
most common in patients aged >50 years and is usually unilateral. Most 
cases are idiopathic, but some occur as a result of hypertensive retin-
opathy, diabetes, retinal detachment, or trauma. When visual acuity is 
reduced to the level of about 6/24 (20/80), vitrectomy and surgical peel-
ing of the membrane to relieve macular puckering are recommended. 
Contraction of an epiretinal membrane sometimes gives rise to a macu-
lar hole. Most macular holes, however, are caused by local vitreous trac-
tion within the fovea. Vitrectomy can improve acuity in selected cases.

Melanoma and Other Tumors  Melanoma is the most common 
primary  tumor  of  the  eye  (Fig.  32-19).  Approximately  2000  cases 
occur annually in the United States. It causes photopsia, an enlarging 

FIGURE 32-19  Melanoma of the choroid, appearing as an elevated dark mass in the 
inferior  fundus,  with  overlying  hemorrhage.  The  black  line  denotes  the  plane  of  the 
optical coherence tomography scan (below) showing the subretinal tumor. 

scotoma,  and  loss  of  vision.  A  small  melanoma  is  often  difficult  to 
differentiate  from  a  benign  choroidal  nevus.  Serial  examinations  are 
required  to  document  a  malignant  pattern  of  growth.  Risk  factors 
include  light  skin,  hair,  and  eyes.  Uveal  origin  accounts  for  85%  of 
cases. GNAQ and GNA11 mutations are common. About half metas-
tasize,  mainly  to  the  liver.  Small  and  medium-sized  tumors  may  be 
treated  with  radiation  therapy;  enucleation  is  the  best  treatment  for 
large tumors. Metastatic tumors to the eye outnumber primary tumors. 
Breast and lung carcinomas have a special propensity to spread to the 
choroid or iris. Leukemia and lymphoma also commonly invade ocular 
tissues. Sometimes their only sign on eye examination is cellular debris 
in the vitreous, which can masquerade as a chronic posterior uveitis.

In a patient with vision loss, CT or MR scanning should be consid-
ered if the cause remains unknown after careful review of the history, 
visual fields, and thorough examination of the eye. Optic nerve sheath 
meningioma  is  a  common  retrobulbar  tumor.  It  produces  the  classic 
triad of optociliary shunt vessels, optic atrophy, and progressive visual 
loss.  Optic  disc  swelling  and  proptosis  are  also  frequent  signs.  Optic 
nerve glioma in young patients is usually a pilocytic astrocytoma and 
has a good prognosis for preservation of vision, especially in neurofi-
bromatosis type 1 (Chap. 90). In adults, optic nerve glioma is rare and 
highly malignant. Chiasmal tumors (pituitary adenoma, meningioma, 
craniopharyngioma)  produce  visual  loss  with  few  objective  findings 
except for optic disc pallor. Loss of the temporal visual field in each eye 
is typically described, but in fact, patients complain of vision loss in just 
one eye. A high degree of vigilance is necessary to avoid missing chias-
mal tumors. Although symptoms progress gradually, in rare instances, 
the  sudden  expansion  of  a  pituitary  adenoma  from  infarction  and 
bleeding (pituitary apoplexy) causes acute retrobulbar visual loss, with 
headache, nausea, and ocular motor nerve palsies.

 ■ PROPTOSIS
When  the  globes  appear  asymmetric,  the  clinician  must  first  decide 
which  eye  is  abnormal.  Is  one  eye  recessed  within  the  orbit  (enoph-
thalmos), or is the other eye protuberant (exophthalmos, or proptosis)? 
A small globe or Horner’s syndrome can give the appearance of eno-
phthalmos. True enophthalmos occurs commonly after trauma, from 
atrophy  of  retrobulbar  fat,  or  from  fracture  of  the  orbital  floor.  The 
position  of  the  eyes  within  the  orbits  is  measured  by  using  a  Hertel 
exophthalmometer,  a  handheld  instrument  that  records  the  position 
of  the  anterior  corneal  surface  relative  to  the  lateral  orbital  rim.  If 
this instrument is not available, relative eye position can be judged by 
bending the patient’s head forward and looking down upon the orbits.

228 A proptosis of only 2 mm in one eye is detectable from this perspective. 
The development of proptosis implies a space-occupying lesion in the 
orbit and usually warrants CT or MR imaging.

Graves’ Ophthalmopathy  This is the leading cause of proptosis 
in adults (Chap. 382). The proptosis is often asymmetric and can even 
appear to be unilateral. Orbital inflammation and engorgement of the 
extraocular  muscles,  particularly  the  medial  rectus  and  the  inferior 
rectus, account for the protrusion of the globe. Corneal exposure, lid 
retraction,  lid  lag  on  downgaze,  conjunctival  injection,  restriction  of 
gaze, diplopia, and visual loss from optic nerve compression are cardi-
nal symptoms. Graves’ eye disease is a clinical diagnosis, but laboratory 
testing can be useful. The serum level of thyroid-stimulating immuno-
globulins  is  often  elevated.  Orbital  imaging  usually  reveals  enlarged 
extraocular  eye  muscles,  but  not  always.  Topical  lubricants,  taping 
the eyelids closed at night, and moisture chambers are helpful to limit 
exposure of ocular tissues. Graves’ ophthalmopathy can be treated with 
oral prednisone (60 mg/d) for 1 month, followed by a taper over several 
months, but worsening of symptoms upon glucocorticoid withdrawal 
is common. Infusions of teprotumumab, an inhibitor of the insulin-like 
growth factor I receptor, reduce proptosis and diplopia. Radiation ther-
apy  is  not  effective.  Orbital  decompression  should  be  performed  for 
severe, symptomatic exophthalmos or if visual function is reduced by 
optic nerve compression. In patients with diplopia, prisms or eye mus-
cle surgery can be used to restore ocular alignment in primary gaze.

Orbital Pseudotumor  This is an idiopathic, inflammatory orbital 
syndrome  that  is  distinguished  from  Graves’  ophthalmopathy  by 
the  prominent  complaint  of  pain.  Other  symptoms  include  diplopia, 
ptosis,  proptosis,  and  orbital  congestion.  Evaluation  for  sarcoidosis, 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and other types of orbital vasculitis 
or collagen-vascular disease is negative. Imaging often shows swollen 
eye  muscles  (orbital  myositis)  with  enlarged  tendons.  By  contrast,  in 
Graves’  ophthalmopathy,  the  tendons  of  the  eye  muscles  usually  are 
spared. The Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (Chap. 441) may be regarded as an 
extension of orbital pseudotumor through the superior orbital fissure 
into the cavernous sinus. The diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor is dif-
ficult. Biopsy of the orbit frequently yields nonspecific evidence of fat 
infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. A dramatic 
response  to  a  therapeutic  trial  of  systemic  glucocorticoids  indirectly 
provides the best confirmation of the diagnosis.

Orbital  Cellulitis  This  causes  pain,  lid  erythema,  proptosis,  con-
junctival chemosis, restricted motility, decreased acuity, afferent pupillary 
defect, fever, and leukocytosis. It often arises from the paranasal sinuses, 
especially  by  contiguous  spread  of  infection  from  the  ethmoid  sinus 
through  the  lamina  papyracea  of  the  medial  orbit.  A  history  of  recent 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  chronic  sinusitis,  thick  mucus  secre-
tions, or dental disease is significant in any patient with suspected orbital 
cellulitis. Blood cultures should be obtained, but they are usually negative. 
Most patients respond to empirical therapy with broad-spectrum IV anti-
biotics. Occasionally, orbital cellulitis follows an overwhelming course, 
with  massive  proptosis,  blindness,  septic  cavernous  sinus  thrombo-
sis,  and  meningitis.  To  avert  this  disaster,  orbital  cellulitis  should  be 
managed  aggressively  in  the  early  stages,  with  immediate  imaging  of 
the orbits and antibiotic therapy that includes coverage of methicillin- 
resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA).  Prompt  surgical  drainage  of 
an orbital abscess or paranasal sinusitis is indicated if optic nerve func-
tion deteriorates despite antibiotics.

Tumors  Tumors  of  the  orbit  cause  painless,  progressive  propto-
sis.  The  most  common  primary  tumors  are  cavernous  hemangioma, 
lymphangioma,  neurofibroma,  schwannoma,  dermoid  cyst,  adenoid 
cystic  carcinoma,  optic  nerve  glioma,  optic  nerve  meningioma,  and 
benign  mixed  tumor  of  the  lacrimal  gland.  Metastatic  tumor  to  the 
orbit  occurs  frequently  in  breast  carcinoma,  lung  carcinoma,  and 
lymphoma.  Diagnosis  by  fine-needle  aspiration  followed  by  urgent 
radiation therapy sometimes can preserve vision.

Carotid  Cavernous  Fistulas  With  anterior  drainage  through 
the  orbit,  these  fistulas  produce  proptosis,  diplopia,  glaucoma,  and 

corkscrew,  arterialized  conjunctival  vessels.  Direct  fistulas  usually 
result  from  trauma.  They  are  easily  diagnosed  because  of  the  prom-
inent  signs  produced  by  high-flow,  high-pressure  shunting.  Indirect 
fistulas, or dural arteriovenous malformations, are more likely to occur 
spontaneously, especially in older women. The signs are more subtle, 
and the diagnosis frequently is missed. The combination of slight prop-
tosis, diplopia, enlarged muscles, and an injected eye often is mistaken 
for  thyroid  ophthalmopathy.  A  bruit  heard  upon  auscultation  of  the 
head or reported by the patient is a valuable diagnostic clue. Imaging 
shows an enlarged superior ophthalmic vein in the orbits. Carotid cav-
ernous shunts can be eliminated by intravascular embolization.

 ■ PTOSIS
Blepharoptosis  This is an abnormal drooping of the eyelid. Unilat-
eral or bilateral ptosis can be congenital, from dysgenesis of the levator 
palpebrae superioris, or from abnormal insertion of its aponeurosis into 
the eyelid. Acquired ptosis can develop so gradually that the patient is 
unaware  of  the  problem.  Inspection  of  old  photographs  is  helpful  in 
dating the onset. A history of prior trauma, eye surgery, contact lens 
use, diplopia, systemic symptoms (e.g., dysphagia or peripheral muscle 
weakness), or a family history of ptosis should be sought. Fluctuating 
ptosis that worsens late in the day is typical of myasthenia gravis. Ptosis 
evaluation  should  focus  on  evidence  for  proptosis,  eyelid  masses  or 
deformities,  inflammation,  pupil  inequality,  or  limitation  of  motility. 
The  width  of  the  palpebral  fissures  is  measured  in  primary  gaze  to 
determine  the  degree  of  ptosis.  The  ptosis  will  be  underestimated  if 
the patient compensates by lifting the brow with the frontalis muscle.

Mechanical  Ptosis  This  occurs  in  many  elderly  patients  from 
stretching  and  redundancy  of  eyelid  skin  and  subcutaneous  fat  (der-
matochalasis). The extra weight of these sagging tissues causes the lid 
to  droop.  Enlargement  or  deformation  of  the  eyelid  from  infection, 
tumor,  trauma,  or  inflammation  also  results  in  ptosis  on  a  purely 
mechanical basis.

Aponeurotic Ptosis  This is an acquired dehiscence or stretching 
of the aponeurotic tendon, which connects the levator muscle to the 
tarsal plate of the eyelid. It occurs commonly in older patients, presum-
ably from loss of connective tissue elasticity. Aponeurotic ptosis is also 
a common sequela of eyelid swelling from infection or blunt trauma to 
the orbit, cataract surgery, or contact lens use.

Myogenic Ptosis  The causes of myogenic ptosis include myasthenia 
gravis (Chap. 448) and a number of rare myopathies that manifest with 
ptosis. The term chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia refers to 
a spectrum of systemic diseases caused by mutations of mitochondrial 
DNA. As the name implies, the most prominent findings are symmet-
ric, slowly progressive ptosis and limitation of eye movements. In gen-
eral, diplopia is a late symptom because all eye movements are reduced 
equally.  In  the  Kearns-Sayre  variant,  retinal  pigmentary  changes  and 
abnormalities of cardiac conduction develop. Peripheral muscle biopsy 
shows characteristic “ragged-red fibers.” Oculopharyngeal dystrophy is a 
distinct autosomal dominant disease with onset in middle age, charac-
terized by ptosis, limited eye movements, and trouble swallowing. Myo-
tonic  dystrophy,  another  autosomal  dominant  disorder,  causes  ptosis, 
ophthalmoparesis, cataract, and pigmentary retinopathy. Patients have 
muscle wasting, myotonia, frontal balding, and cardiac abnormalities.

Neurogenic Ptosis  This results from a lesion affecting the inner-
vation to either of the two muscles that open the eyelid: Müller’s muscle 
or  the  levator  palpebrae  superioris.  Examination  of  the  pupil  helps 
distinguish between these two possibilities. In Horner’s syndrome, the 
eye with ptosis has a smaller pupil and the eye movements are full. In 
an  oculomotor  nerve  palsy,  the  eye  with  the  ptosis  has  a  larger  or  a 
normal pupil. If the pupil is normal but there is limitation of adduction, 
elevation,  and  depression,  a  pupil-sparing  oculomotor  nerve  palsy  is 
likely  (see  next  section).  Rarely,  a  lesion  affecting  the  small,  central 
subnucleus of the oculomotor complex will cause bilateral ptosis with 
normal eye movements and pupils.

 ■ DOUBLE VISION (DIPLOPIA)
The  first  point  to  clarify  is  whether  diplopia  persists  in  either  eye 
after the opposite eye is covered. If it does, the diagnosis is monocular 
diplopia.  The  cause  is  usually  intrinsic  to  the  eye  and  therefore  has 
no  dire  implications  for  the  patient.  Corneal  aberrations  (e.g.,  kera-
toconus,  pterygium),  uncorrected  refractive  error,  cataract,  or  foveal 
traction  may  give  rise  to  monocular  diplopia.  Occasionally,  it  is  a 
symptom of malingering or psychiatric disease. Diplopia alleviated by 
covering one eye is binocular diplopia and is caused by disruption of 
ocular alignment. Inquiry should be made into the nature of the dou-
ble vision (purely side-by-side versus partial vertical displacement of 
images), mode of onset, duration, intermittency, diurnal variation, and 
associated neurologic or systemic symptoms. If the patient has diplo-
pia while being examined, motility testing should reveal a deficiency 
corresponding  to  the  patient’s  symptoms.  However,  subtle  limitation 
of ocular excursions is often difficult to detect. For example, a patient 
with a slight left abducens nerve paresis may appear to have full eye 
movements  despite  a  complaint  of  horizontal  diplopia  upon  looking 
to  the  left.  In  this  situation,  the  cover  test  provides  a  more  sensitive 
method for demonstrating the ocular misalignment. It should be con-
ducted  in  primary  gaze  and  then  with  the  head  turned  and  tilted  in 
each direction while the patient fixates a central, distant target. In the 
above example, a cover test with the head turned to the right bringing 
the eyes into left gaze will maximize the fixation shift evoked by the 
cover test.

Occasionally,  a  cover  test  performed  in  an  asymptomatic  patient 
during  a  routine  examination  will  reveal  an  ocular  deviation.  If  the 
eye  movements  are  full  and  the  ocular  misalignment  is  equal  in  all 
directions  of  gaze  (comitant  deviation),  the  diagnosis  is  strabismus. 
In  this  condition,  which  affects  about  1%  of  the  population,  fusion 
is  disrupted  in  infancy  or  early  childhood.  To  avoid  diplopia,  retinal 
input from the nonfixating eye may be partially suppressed. In some 
children, this leads to impaired vision (amblyopia, or “lazy” eye) in the 
deviated eye.

Binocular diplopia results from a wide range of processes: infectious, 
neoplastic,  metabolic,  degenerative,  inflammatory,  and  vascular.  One 
must  decide  whether  the  diplopia  is  neurogenic  in  origin  or  is  due 
to  restriction  of  globe  rotation  by  local  disease  in  the  orbit.  Orbital 
pseudotumor, myositis, infection, tumor, thyroid disease, and muscle 
entrapment  (e.g.,  from  a  blowout  fracture)  cause  restrictive  diplopia. 
The  diagnosis  of  restriction  is  usually  made  by  recognizing  other 
associated  signs  and  symptoms  of  local  orbital  disease.  Dedicated, 
high-resolution orbital imaging is helpful when the cause of diplopia 
is not evident.
Myasthenia Gravis 
(See also Chap. 448) This is a major cause of 
painless diplopia. The diplopia is often intermittent, variable, and not 
confined to any single ocular motor nerve distribution. The pupils are 
always normal. Serial observation of a fatigable ptosis, often accompa-
nied by diplopia from fluctuating ocular misalignment, establishes the 
diagnosis. Many patients have a purely ocular form of the disease, with 
no evidence of systemic muscular weakness. Classically, the diagnosis 
was  confirmed  by  an  IV  edrophonium  injection,  which  produces  a 
transient  reversal  of  eyelid  or  eye  muscle  weakness,  but  this  drug  is 
discontinued  in  the  United  States.  Blood  tests  for  antibodies  against 
the acetylcholine receptor or the MuSK protein are frequently negative 
in the purely ocular form of myasthenia gravis. Botulism from food or 
wound poisoning can mimic ocular myasthenia.

If  restrictive  orbital  disease  and  myasthenia  gravis  are  excluded,  a 
lesion of a cranial nerve supplying innervation to the extraocular mus-
cles is the most likely cause of binocular diplopia.
Oculomotor Nerve  The third cranial nerve innervates the medial, 
inferior, and superior recti; inferior oblique; levator palpebrae superi-
oris; and the iris sphincter. Total palsy of the oculomotor nerve causes 
ptosis, a dilated pupil, and leaves the eye “down and out” because of 
the unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique. This 
combination of findings is obvious. More challenging is the diagnosis 
of  early  or  partial  oculomotor  nerve  palsy.  In  this  setting,  any  com-
bination  of  ptosis,  pupil  dilation,  and  weakness  of  the  eye  muscles 

supplied  by  the  oculomotor  nerve  may  be  encountered.  Frequent 
serial examinations during the rapidly evolving phase of the palsy help 
ensure that the diagnosis is not missed. The advent of an oculomotor 
nerve palsy with a pupil involvement, especially when accompanied by 
pain, suggests a compressive lesion, such as a tumor or circle of Willis 
aneurysm. Urgent neuroimaging should be obtained, along with a CT 
or MR angiogram. The resolution of these noninvasive techniques has 
advanced to the point that catheter angiography is rarely necessary to 
exclude an aneurysm.

A lesion of the oculomotor nucleus in the rostral midbrain produces 
signs that differ from those caused by a lesion of the nerve itself. There 
is bilateral ptosis because the levator muscle is innervated by a single 
central subnucleus. There is also weakness of the contralateral superior 
rectus, because it is supplied by the oculomotor nucleus on the other 
side. Occasionally both superior recti are weak. Isolated nuclear oculo-
motor palsy is rare. Usually, neurologic examination reveals additional 
signs  that  suggest  brainstem  damage  from  infarction,  hemorrhage, 
tumor, or infection.

Injury to structures surrounding fascicles of the oculomotor nerve 
descending through the midbrain has given rise to a number of classic 
eponymic designations. In Nothnagel’s syndrome, injury to the superior 
cerebellar peduncle causes ipsilateral oculomotor palsy and contralat-
eral cerebellar ataxia. In Benedikt’s syndrome, injury to the red nucleus 
results in ipsilateral oculomotor palsy and contralateral tremor, chorea, 
and athetosis. Claude’s syndrome incorporates features of both of these 
syndromes, by injury to both the red nucleus and the superior cerebel-
lar peduncle. Finally, in Weber’s syndrome, injury to the cerebral pedun-
cle causes ipsilateral oculomotor palsy with contralateral hemiparesis.
In  the  subarachnoid  space,  the  oculomotor  nerve  is  vulnerable  to 
aneurysm, meningitis, tumor, infarction, and compression. In cerebral 
herniation, the nerve becomes trapped between the edge of the tento-
rium and the uncus of the temporal lobe. Oculomotor palsy also can 
result  from  midbrain  torsion  and  hemorrhage  during  herniation.  In 
the cavernous sinus, oculomotor palsy arises from carotid aneurysm, 
carotid cavernous fistula, cavernous sinus thrombosis, tumor (pituitary 
adenoma,  meningioma,  metastasis),  herpes  zoster  infection,  and  the 
Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.

The  etiology  of  an  isolated,  pupil-sparing  oculomotor  palsy  often 
remains an enigma even after neuroimaging and extensive laboratory 
testing. Most cases are thought to result from microvascular infarction 
of  the  nerve  somewhere  along  its  course  from  the  brainstem  to  the 
orbit.  Usually,  the  patient  complains  of  pain.  Diabetes,  hypertension, 
and vascular disease are major risk factors. Spontaneous recovery over 
a period of months is the rule. If this fails to occur or if new findings 
develop, the diagnosis of microvascular oculomotor nerve palsy should 
be  reconsidered.  Aberrant  regeneration  is  common  when  the  oculo-
motor nerve is injured by trauma or compression (tumor, aneurysm). 
Miswiring of sprouting fibers to the levator muscle and the rectus mus-
cles results in elevation of the eyelid upon downgaze or adduction. The 
pupil also constricts upon attempted adduction, elevation, or depres-
sion of the globe. Aberrant regeneration is not seen after oculomotor 
palsy from microvascular infarct and hence vitiates that diagnosis.

Trochlear Nerve  The fourth cranial nerve originates in the mid-
brain,  just  caudal  to  the  oculomotor  nerve  complex.  Fibers  exit  the 
brainstem  dorsally  and  cross  to  innervate  the  contralateral  superior 
oblique. The principal actions of this muscle are to depress and intort 
the globe. A palsy therefore results in hypertropia and excyclotorsion. 
The cyclotorsion seldom is noticed by patients. Instead, they complain 
of vertical diplopia, especially upon reading or looking down. Vertical 
diplopia  is  exacerbated  by  tilting  the  head  toward  the  side  with  the 
muscle palsy and alleviated by tilting it away. This “head tilt test” is a 
cardinal diagnostic feature. Review of old photographs will sometimes 
reveal a habitual head tilt, signifying a patient with a decompensated, 
congenital trochlear nerve palsy.

New, isolated trochlear nerve palsy results from all the causes listed 
above for the oculomotor nerve except aneurysm. The trochlear nerve 
is particularly apt to suffer injury after closed head trauma. The free 
edge of the tentorium impinges on the nerve during a concussive blow.

230 Most  isolated  trochlear  nerve  palsies  are  idiopathic  and  hence  are 
diagnosed by exclusion as “microvascular.” Spontaneous improvement 
occurs over a period of months in most patients. A base-down prism 
(conveniently applied to the patient’s glasses as a stick-on Fresnel lens) 
may  serve  as  a  temporary  measure  to  alleviate  diplopia.  If  the  palsy 
does not resolve, the eyes can be realigned by weakening the inferior 
oblique muscle.

Abducens  Nerve  The  sixth  cranial  nerve  innervates  the  lateral 
rectus  muscle.  A  palsy  produces  horizontal  diplopia,  worse  on  gaze 
to the side of the lesion. A nuclear lesion has different consequences, 
because  the  abducens  nucleus  contains  interneurons  that  project  via 
the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the medial rectus subnucleus of 
the contralateral oculomotor complex. Therefore, an abducens nuclear 
lesion  produces  a  complete  lateral  gaze  palsy  from  weakness  of  both 
the ipsilateral lateral rectus and the contralateral medial rectus. Foville’s 
syndrome after dorsal pontine injury includes lateral gaze palsy, ipsilat-
eral facial palsy, and contralateral hemiparesis incurred by damage to 
descending corticospinal fibers. Millard-Gubler syndrome from ventral 
pontine injury is similar except for the eye findings. There is lateral rec-
tus weakness only, instead of gaze palsy, because the abducens fascicle 
is injured rather than the nucleus. Infarct, tumor, hemorrhage, vascular 
malformation, and multiple sclerosis are the most common etiologies 
of brainstem abducens palsy.

After  leaving  the  ventral  pons,  the  abducens  nerve  runs  forward 
along the clivus to pierce the dura at the petrous apex, where it enters 
the cavernous sinus. Along its subarachnoid course, it is susceptible to 
meningitis, tumor (meningioma, chordoma, carcinomatous meningi-
tis), subarachnoid hemorrhage, trauma, and compression by aneurysm 
or dolichoectatic vessels. At the petrous apex, mastoiditis can produce 
deafness, pain, and ipsilateral abducens palsy (Gradenigo’s syndrome). 
In  the  cavernous  sinus,  the  nerve  can  be  affected  by  carotid  aneu-
rysm,  carotid  cavernous  fistula,  tumor  (pituitary  adenoma,  menin-
gioma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma), herpes infection, and Tolosa-Hunt 
syndrome.

Unilateral  or  bilateral  abducens  palsy  is  a  classic  sign  of  raised 
intracranial pressure. The diagnosis can be confirmed if papilledema is 
observed on fundus examination. The mechanism is still debated but 
probably is related to rostral-caudal displacement of the brainstem. The 
same  phenomenon  accounts  for  abducens  palsy  from  Chiari  malfor-
mation or low intracranial pressure (e.g., after lumbar puncture, spinal 
anesthesia, or spontaneous dural cerebrospinal fluid leak).

Treatment  of  abducens  palsy  is  aimed  at  prompt  correction  of 
the  underlying  cause.  However,  the  cause  remains  obscure  in  many 
instances  despite  diligent  evaluation.  As  was  mentioned  above  for 
isolated trochlear or oculomotor palsy, most cases are assumed to rep-
resent  microvascular  infarcts  because  they  often  occur  in  the  setting 
of diabetes or other vascular risk factors. Some cases may develop as 
a postinfectious mononeuritis (e.g., after a viral flu). Patching one eye, 
occluding one eyeglass lens with tape, or applying a temporary prism 
will  provide  relief  of  diplopia  until  the  palsy  resolves.  If  recovery  is 
incomplete, eye muscle surgery nearly always can realign the eyes, at 
least in primary position. A patient with an abducens palsy that fails 
to  improve  should  be  reevaluated  for  an  occult  etiology  (e.g.,  chor-
doma, carcinomatous meningitis, carotid cavernous fistula, myasthenia 
gravis). Skull base tumors are easily missed even on contrast-enhanced 
neuroimaging studies.

Multiple  Ocular  Motor  Nerve  Palsies  These  should  not  be 
attributed  to  spontaneous  microvascular  events  affecting  more  than 
one  cranial  nerve  at  a  time.  This  remarkable  coincidence  does  occur, 
especially  in  diabetic  patients,  but  the  diagnosis  is  made  only  in  ret-
rospect  after  all  other  diagnostic  alternatives  have  been  exhausted. 
Neuroimaging  should  focus  on  the  cavernous  sinus,  superior  orbital 
fissure,  and  orbital  apex,  where  all  three  ocular  motor  nerves  are  in 
close  proximity.  In  a  diabetic  or  immunocompromised  host,  fungal 
infection  (Aspergillus,  Mucorales,  Cryptococcus)  is  a  common  cause  of 
multiple nerve palsies. In a patient with systemic malignancy, carcino-
matous meningitis is a likely diagnosis. Cytologic examination may be 

negative despite repeated sampling of the cerebrospinal fluid. The can-
cer-associated Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome also can produce 
ophthalmoplegia. Giant cell (temporal) arteritis occasionally manifests 
as diplopia from ischemic palsies of extraocular muscles. Fisher’s syn-
drome, an ocular variant of Guillain-Barré, produces ophthalmoplegia 
with areflexia and ataxia. Often the ataxia is mild, and the reflexes are 
normal. Antiganglioside antibodies (GQ1b) can be detected in about 
50% of cases.

Supranuclear  Disorders  of  Gaze  These  are  often  mistaken  for 
multiple ocular motor nerve palsies. For example, Wernicke’s encepha-
lopathy can produce nystagmus and a partial deficit of horizontal and 
vertical gaze that mimics a combined abducens and oculomotor nerve 
palsy.  The  disorder  occurs  in  patients  who  are  malnourished,  alco-
holic, or following bariatric surgery, and can be reversed by thiamine. 
Infarct, hemorrhage, tumor, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, vasculitis, 
and  Whipple’s  disease  are  other  important  causes  of  supranuclear 
gaze  palsy.  Disorders  of  vertical  gaze,  especially  downward  saccades, 
are  an  early  feature  of  progressive  supranuclear  palsy.  Smooth  pur-
suit  is  affected  later  in  the  course  of  the  disease.  Parkinson’s  disease,  
Huntington’s  disease,  and  olivopontocerebellar  degeneration  also  can 
affect vertical gaze.

The frontal eye field of the cerebral cortex is involved in generation 
of saccades to the contralateral side. After hemispheric stroke, the eyes 
usually  deviate  toward  the  lesioned  side  because  of  the  unopposed 
action  of  the  frontal  eye  field  in  the  normal  hemisphere.  With  time, 
this  deficit  resolves.  Seizures  generally  have  the  opposite  effect:  the 
eyes deviate conjugately away from the irritative focus. Parietal lesions 
disrupt smooth pursuit of targets moving toward the side of the lesion. 
Bilateral  parietal  lesions  produce  Bálint’s  syndrome,  which  is  charac-
terized  by  impaired  eye-hand  coordination  (optic  ataxia),  difficulty 
initiating voluntary eye movements (ocular apraxia), and visuospatial 
disorientation (simultanagnosia).

Horizontal  Gaze  Descending  cortical  inputs  mediating  horizon-
tal  gaze  ultimately  converge  at  the  level  of  the  pons.  Neurons  in  the 
paramedian pontine reticular formation are responsible for controlling 
conjugate gaze toward the same side. They project directly to the ipsi-
lateral  abducens  nucleus.  A  lesion  of  either  the  paramedian  pontine 
reticular formation or the abducens nucleus causes an ipsilateral conju-
gate gaze palsy. Lesions at either locus produce nearly identical clinical 
syndromes, with the following exception: vestibular stimulation (ocu-
locephalic maneuver or caloric irrigation) will succeed in driving the 
eyes conjugately to the side in a patient with a lesion of the paramedian 
pontine  reticular  formation  but  not  in  a  patient  with  a  lesion  of  the 
abducens nucleus.

INTERNUCLEAR  OPHTHALMOPLEGIA  This  results  from  damage  to 
the  medial  longitudinal  fasciculus  ascending  from  the  abducens 
nucleus in the pons to the oculomotor nucleus in the midbrain (hence, 
“internuclear”).  Damage  to  fibers  carrying  the  conjugate  signal  from 
abducens interneurons to the contralateral medial rectus motoneurons 
results in a failure of adduction on attempted lateral gaze. For example, 
a  patient  with  a  left  internuclear  ophthalmoplegia  (INO)  will  have 
slowed  or  absent  adducting  movements  of  the  left  eye  (Fig.  32-20). 
A  patient  with  bilateral  injury  to  the  medial  longitudinal  fasciculus 
will have bilateral INO. Multiple sclerosis is the most common cause, 
although  tumor,  stroke,  trauma,  or  any  brainstem  process  may  be 
responsible. One-and-a-half syndrome is due to a lesion of the medial 
longitudinal fasciculus combined with a lesion of either the abducens 
nucleus  or  the  paramedian  pontine  reticular  formation  on  the  same 
side. The patient’s only horizontal eye movement is abduction of the 
eye on the other side.

Vertical Gaze  This is controlled at the level of the midbrain. The 
neuronal  circuits  affected  in  disorders  of  vertical  gaze  are  not  fully 
elucidated, but lesions of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial 
longitudinal  fasciculus  and  the  interstitial  nucleus  of  Cajal  cause 
supranuclear  paresis  of  upgaze,  downgaze,  or  all  vertical  eye  move-
ments.  Distal  basilar  artery  ischemia  is  the  most  common  etiology.

PARINAUD’S  SYNDROME  Also  known  as  dorsal  midbrain  syndrome, 
this is a distinct supranuclear vertical gaze disorder caused by damage 
to the posterior commissure. It is a classic sign of hydrocephalus from 
aqueductal  stenosis.  Pineal  region  or  midbrain  tumors,  cysticercosis, 
and  stroke  also  cause  Parinaud’s  syndrome.  Features  include  loss  of 
upgaze (and sometimes downgaze), convergence-retraction nystagmus 
on attempted upgaze, downward ocular deviation (“setting sun” sign), 
lid  retraction  (Collier’s  sign),  skew  deviation,  pseudoabducens  palsy, 
and light-near dissociation of the pupils.

Nystagmus  This  is  a  rhythmic  oscillation  of  the  eyes,  occurring 
physiologically from vestibular and optokinetic stimulation or patho-
logically in a wide variety of diseases (Chap. 22). Abnormalities of the 
eyes or optic nerves, present at birth or acquired in childhood, can pro-
duce  a  complex,  searching  nystagmus  with  irregular  pendular  (sinu-
soidal)  and  jerk  features.  Examples  are  albinism,  Leber’s  congenital 
amaurosis, and bilateral cataract. This nystagmus is commonly referred 
to as congenital sensory nystagmus. This is a poor term because even in 
children with congenital lesions, the nystagmus does not appear until 
weeks after birth. Congenital motor nystagmus, which looks similar to 
congenital sensory nystagmus, develops in the absence of any abnor-
mality  of  the  sensory  visual  system.  Visual  acuity  also  is  reduced  in 
congenital  motor  nystagmus,  probably  by  the  nystagmus  itself,  but 
seldom below a level of 20/200.

JERK NYSTAGMUS  This is characterized by a slow drift off the target, 
followed by a fast corrective saccade. By convention, the nystagmus is 
named after the quick phase. Jerk nystagmus can be downbeat, upbeat, 
horizontal (left or right), and torsional. The pattern of nystagmus may 
vary with gaze position. Some patients will be oblivious to their nystag-
mus. Others will complain of blurred vision or a subjective to-and-fro 
movement of the environment (oscillopsia) corresponding to the nys-
tagmus. Fine nystagmus may be difficult to see on gross examination 
of the eyes. Observation of nystagmoid movements of the optic disc on 
ophthalmoscopy is a sensitive way to detect subtle nystagmus.

GAZE-EVOKED  NYSTAGMUS  This  is  the  most  common  form  of  jerk 
nystagmus.  When  the  eyes  are  held  eccentrically  in  the  orbits,  they 
have a natural tendency to drift back to primary position. The subject 
compensates by making a corrective saccade to maintain the deviated 
eye position. Many normal patients have mild gaze-evoked nystagmus. 
Exaggerated  gaze-evoked  nystagmus  can  be  induced  by  drugs  (sed-
atives,  anticonvulsants,  alcohol);  muscle  paresis;  myasthenia  gravis; 
demyelinating  disease;  and  cerebellopontine  angle,  brainstem,  and 
cerebellar lesions.

VESTIBULAR NYSTAGMUS  Vestibular nystagmus results from dysfunc-
tion of the labyrinth (Ménière’s disease), vestibular nerve, or vestibular 
nucleus in the brainstem. Peripheral vestibular nystagmus often occurs 
in discrete attacks, with symptoms of nausea and vertigo. There may 
be associated tinnitus and hearing loss. Sudden shifts in head position 
may provoke or exacerbate symptoms.
DOWNBEAT  NYSTAGMUS  Downbeat  nystagmus  results  from  lesions 
near the craniocervical junction (Chiari malformation, basilar invagi-
nation). It also has been reported in brainstem or cerebellar stroke, lith-
ium or anticonvulsant intoxication, alcoholism, and multiple sclerosis. 
Upbeat nystagmus is associated with damage to the pontine tegmentum 
from stroke, demyelination, or tumor.

Opsoclonus  This  rare,  dramatic  disorder  of  eye  movements  con-
sists  of  bursts  of  consecutive  saccades  (saccadomania).  When  the 
saccades are confined to the horizontal plane, the term ocular flutter is 
preferred. It can result from viral encephalitis, trauma, or a paraneo-
plastic effect of neuroblastoma, breast carcinoma, and other malignan-
cies. It has also been reported as a benign, transient phenomenon in 
otherwise healthy patients.

33 Disorders of Smell  
and Taste
Richard L. Doty, Steven M. Bromley

All  environmental  chemicals  necessary  for  life  enter  the  body  by  the 
nose and mouth. The senses of smell (olfaction) and taste (gustation) 
monitor such chemicals, determine the flavor and palatability of foods 
and  beverages,  and  warn  of  dangerous  environmental  conditions, 
including  fire,  air  pollution,  leaking  natural  gas,  and  bacteria-laden 
foodstuffs. These senses contribute significantly to quality of life and, 
when dysfunctional, can have untoward physical and psychological con-
sequences. A longitudinal study of 1162 nondemented elderly persons 
found, even after controlling for confounders, that those with the lowest 
baseline  olfactory  test  scores  had  a  45%  mortality  rate  over  a  4-year 
period, compared to an 18% mortality rate for those with the highest 
olfactory  test  scores.  A  basic  understanding  of  these  senses  in  health 
and disease is critical for the physician, because thousands of patients 
present to doctors’ offices each year with complaints of chemosensory 
dysfunction. Among the more important recent developments in neu-
rology is the discovery that decreased smell function is among the first 

signs  of  such  neurodegenerative  diseases  as  Parkinson’s  disease  (PD) 
and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), signifying their “presymptomatic” phase.
 ■ ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
Olfactory  System  Odorous  chemicals  enter  the  front  of  nose 
during inhalation and active sniffing, as well as the back of the nose 
(nasopharynx) during deglutition. After reaching the highest recesses 
of the nasal cavity, they dissolve in the olfactory mucus and diffuse or 
are  actively  transported  by  specialized  proteins  to  receptors  located 
on the cilia of olfactory receptor cells. The cilia, dendrites, cell bodies, 
and proximal axonal segments of these bipolar cells are located within 
a unique neuroepithelium covering the cribriform plate, the superior 
nasal septum, superior turbinate, and sectors of the middle turbinate 
(Fig.  33-1).  Nearly  400  types  of  G-protein-coupled  odor  receptors 
(GPCRs) are expressed on the cilia of the receptor cells, with only one 
type of GPCR being expressed on a given cell. Other receptors, includ-
ing trace amine-associated receptors and members of the non-GPCR 
membrane-spanning  4-domain  family,  subfamily  A  (MS4A)  protein 
family, are also present on some receptor cells. Such a plethora of recep-
tor cell types does not exist in any other sensory system. Importantly, 
when damaged, the receptor cells can be replaced by stem cells near the 
basement membrane, although such replacement is often incomplete.

After  coalescing  into  bundles  surrounded  by  glia-like  ensheathing 
cells (termed fila), the receptor cell axons pass through the cribriform 
plate to the olfactory bulbs, where they synapse with dendrites of other 
cell types within the glomeruli (Fig. 33-2). These spherical structures, 
which make up a distinct layer of the olfactory bulb, are a site of conver-
gence of information, because many more fibers enter than leave them. 
Receptor  cells  that  express  the  same  type  of  receptor  project  to  the 
same glomeruli, effectively making each glomerulus a functional unit. 
The major projection neurons of the olfactory system—the mitral and 
tufted  cells—send  primary  dendrites  into  the  glomeruli,  connecting 
not only with the incoming receptor cell axons, but with dendrites of 
periglomerular cells. The activity of the mitral/tufted cells is modulated 
by  the  periglomerular  cells,  secondary  dendrites  from  other  mitral/
tufted cells, and granule cells, the most numerous cells of the bulb. The 
latter  cells,  which  are  largely  GABAergic,  receive  inputs  from  central 
brain  structures  and  modulate  the  output  of  the  mitral/tufted  cells. 
Interestingly, like the olfactory receptor cells, some cells within the bulb 
undergo  replacement.  Thus,  neuroblasts  formed  within  the  anterior 
subventricular  zone  of  the  brain  migrate  along  the  rostral  migratory 
stream, ultimately becoming granule and periglomerular cells.

The axons of the mitral and tufted cells synapse within secondary 
olfactory  structures,  which  largely  compose  the  primary  olfactory  
cortex (POC) (Fig. 33-3). The POC is defined as those cortical struc-
tures that receive direct projections from the olfactory bulb, most nota-
bly the piriform and entorhinal cortices. Although olfaction is unique

Taste System  Tastants are sensed by specialized receptor cells present 
within taste buds—small grapefruit-like segmented structures located on 
the lateral margins and dorsum of the tongue, roof of the mouth, phar-
ynx, larynx, and superior esophagus (Fig. 33-4). Lingual taste buds are 
embedded  in  well-defined  protuberances,  termed  fungiform,  foliate, 
and  circumvallate  papillae.  After  dissolving  in  a  liquid,  tastants  enter 
the opening of the taste bud—the taste pore—and bind to receptors on 
microvilli, small extensions of receptor cells within each taste bud. Such 
binding changes the electrical potential across the taste cell, resulting in 
neurotransmitter  release  onto  the  first-order  taste  neurons.  Although 
humans have ~7500 taste buds, not all harbor taste-sensitive cells; some 
contain only one class of receptor (e.g., cells responsive only to sugars), 
whereas others contain cells sensitive to more than one class. The num-
ber of taste receptor cells per taste bud ranges from zero to well over 100. 
A small family of three GPCRs, namely T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3, mediate 
sweet and umami taste sensations. Bitter sensations, on the other hand, 
depend  on  T2R  receptors,  a  family  of  ~30  GPCRs  expressed  on  cells 
different from those that express the sweet and umami receptors. T2Rs 
sense  a  wide  range  of  bitter  substances  but  do  not  distinguish  among 
them.  Sour  tastants  are  sensed  by  the  PKD2L1  receptor,  a  member  of 
the transient receptor potential protein (TRP) family. Perception of salty 
sensations, such as induced by sodium chloride, arises from the entry of 
Na+ ions into the cells via specialized membrane channels, such as the 
amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel.

It  is  now  well  established  that  both  bitter  and  sweet  taste-related 
receptors are also present elsewhere in the body, most notably in the 
alimentary  and  respiratory  tracts.  This  important  discovery  general-
izes the concept of taste-related chemoreception to areas of the body 
beyond  the  mouth  and  throat,  with  α-gustducin,  the  taste-specific 
G-protein α-subunit, expressed in so-called brush cells found specifi-
cally within the human trachea, lung, pancreas, and gallbladder. These 
brush  cells  are  rich  in  nitric  oxide  (NO)  synthase,  known  to  defend 
against  xenobiotic  organisms,  protect  the  mucosa  from  acid-induced 
lesions, and, in the case of the gastrointestinal tract, stimulate vagal and 
splanchnic afferent neurons. NO further acts on nearby cells, including 
enteroendocrine cells, absorptive or secretory epithelial cells, mucosal 
blood  vessels,  and  cells  of  the  immune  system.  Members  of  the  T2R 
family  of  bitter  receptors  and  the  sweet  receptors  of  the  T1R  family 
have been identified within the gastrointestinal tract and in enteroen-
docrine  cell  lines.  In  some  cases,  these  receptors  are  important  for 
metabolism,  with  the  T1R3  receptors  and  gustducin  playing  decisive 
roles in the sensing and transport of dietary sugars from the intestinal 
lumen  into  absorptive  enterocytes  via  a  sodium-dependent  glucose 
transporter and in regulation of hormone release from gut enteroendo-
crine cells. In other cases, these receptors may be important for airway 
protection,  with  a  number  of  T2R  bitter  receptors  in  the  motile  cilia 
of the human airway that respond to bitter compounds by increasing 
their beat frequency. One specific T2R38 taste receptor is expressed in 
human  upper  respiratory  epithelia  and  responds  to  acyl-monoserine 
lactone  quorum-sensing  molecules  secreted  by  Pseudomonas  aerug-
inosa  and  other  gram-negative  bacteria.  Differences  in  T2R38  func-
tionality, as related to TAS2R38 genotype, correlate with susceptibility 
to upper respiratory infections in humans.

Taste information is sent to the brain via three cranial nerves (CNs): 
CN VII (the facial nerve, which involves the intermediate nerve with 
its branches, the greater petrosal and chorda tympani nerves), CN IX 
(the glossopharyngeal nerve), and CN X (the vagus nerve) (Fig. 33-5). 
CN VII innervates the anterior tongue and all of the soft palate, CN 
IX innervates the posterior tongue, and CN X innervates the laryngeal 
surface of the epiglottis, larynx, and proximal portion of the esophagus. 
The  mandibular  branch  of  CN  V  (V3)  conveys  somatosensory  infor-
mation (e.g., touch, burning, cooling, irritation) to the brain. Although 
not technically a gustatory nerve, CN V shares primary nerve routes 
with many of the gustatory nerve fibers and adds temperature, texture, 
pungency, and spiciness to the taste experience. The chorda tympani

nerve is famous for taking a recurrent course through the facial canal in 
the petrosal portion of the temporal bone, passing through the middle 
ear, and then exiting the skull via the petrotympanic fissure, where it 
joins the lingual nerve (a division of CN V) near the tongue. This nerve 
also carries parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular and sublin-
gual  glands,  whereas  the  greater  petrosal  nerve  supplies  the  palatine 
glands, thereby influencing saliva production.

The  axons  of  the  projection  cells,  which  synapse  with  taste  buds, 
enter  the  rostral  portion  of  the  nucleus  of  the  solitary  tract  (NTS) 
within the medulla of the brainstem (Fig. 33-5). From the NTS, neu-
rons  then  project  to  a  division  of  the  ventroposteromedial  thalamic 
nucleus  (VPM)  via  the  medial  lemniscus.  From  here,  projections  are 
made to the rostral part of the frontal operculum and adjoining insula, 

a brain region considered the primary taste cortex (PTC). Projections 
from the PTC then go to the secondary taste cortex, namely the caudola-
teral OFC. This brain region is involved in the conscious recognition of 
taste qualities. Moreover, because it contains cells that are activated by 
several sensory modalities, it is likely a center for establishing “flavor.”
 ■ DISORDERS OF OLFACTION
The ability to smell is influenced, in everyday life, by such factors as 
age, gender, general health, nutrition, smoking, and reproductive state. 
Women  typically  outperform  men  on  tests  of  olfactory  function  and 
retain normal smell function to a later age than do men.

Estimates of the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in the general 
population  vary;  a  cross-sectional  analysis  from  the  National  Health 
and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey  (NHANES  2013–2014)  found  an 
overall  prevalence  of  13.5%.  However,  it  is  apparent  that  significant 
decrements in the ability to smell are present in >50% of the population 
between  65  and  80  years  of  age  and  in  75%  of  those  aged  ≥80  years  
(Fig. 33-6). Such presbyosmia helps to explain why many elderly report

that food has little flavor, a problem that can result in nutritional dis-
turbances. This also helps to explain why a disproportionate number 
of elderly die in accidental gas poisonings. A relatively complete listing 
of  conditions  and  disorders  that  have  been  associated  with  olfactory 
dysfunction is presented in Table 33-1.

Aside  from  aging,  the  three  most  common  identifiable  causes  of 
long-lasting  or  permanent  smell  loss  seen  in  the  clinic  are,  in  order 
of  frequency,  severe  upper  respiratory  infections,  head  trauma,  and 
chronic  rhinosinusitis.  The  physiologic  basis  for  most  head  trauma–
related losses is the shearing and subsequent scarring of the olfactory fila 
as they pass from the nasal cavity into the brain cavity. The cribriform 
plate does not have to be fractured or show pathology for smell loss to 
be  present.  Severity  of  trauma,  as  indexed  by  a  poor  Glasgow  Coma 
Scale score on presentation and the length of posttraumatic amnesia, is 
associated with higher risk of olfactory impairment. Less than 10% of 
posttraumatic anosmic patients will recover age-related normal function 
over  time.  This  increases  to  nearly  25%  of  those  with  less-than-total 

loss. Respiratory infections, such as those associated with the common 
cold,  influenza,  pneumonia,  HIV,  and  COVID-19  can  directly  and 
permanently damage the olfactory epithelium, decreasing receptor cell 
number, damaging cilia on remaining receptor cells, and inducing the 
replacement  of  sensory  epithelium  with  respiratory  epithelium.  The 
smell  loss  associated  with  chronic  rhinosinusitis  is  related  to  disease 
severity,  with  most  loss  occurring  in  cases  where  rhinosinusitis  and 
polyposis  are  both  present.  Smell  loss  is  among  the  first  signs  of  the 
SARS-CoV-2 infection responsible for COVID-19, a loss that is seem-
ingly  independent  of  nasal  inflammation.  Although  in  rhinosinusitis 
cases  systemic  glucocorticoid  therapy  can  usually  induce  short-term 
functional improvement, it does not, on average, return smell test scores 
to normal, implying that chronic permanent neural loss is present and/
or  that  short-term  administration  of  systemic  glucocorticoids  does 
not  completely  mitigate  the  inflammation.  It  is  well  established  that 
microinflammation in an otherwise seemingly normal epithelium can 
influence smell function.

A number of neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by olfactory 
impairment,  including  PD,  AD,  Huntington’s  disease,  parkinsonism- 
dementia complex of Guam, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multi-
ple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, 
and Down’s syndrome; smell loss can also occur in idiopathic rapid eye 
movement (REM) behavioral sleep disorder (iRBD), as well as in multi-
ple sclerosis (MS) related to lesions within olfaction-related structures. 
Olfactory impairment in PD often predates the clinical diagnosis by a 
number of years. In staged cases, studies of the sequence of formation 
of abnormal α-synuclein aggregates and Lewy bodies suggest that the 
olfactory  bulbs  may  be,  along  with  the  dorsomotor  nucleus  of  the 
vagus,  the  first  site  of  neural  damage  in  PD.  In  postmortem  studies 
of  patients  with  very  mild  “presymptomatic”  signs  of  AD,  poorer 
smell  function  has  been  associated  with  higher  levels  of  AD-related 
pathology.  Smell  loss  is  more  marked  in  patients  with  early  clinical 
manifestations  of  DLB  than  in  those  with  mild  AD.  Interestingly, 
smell loss is minimal or nonexistent in progressive supranuclear palsy 
and  1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine  (MPTP)-induced 
parkinsonism. The relative contributions of disease-specific pathology 
or differential damage to forebrain neuromodulator/neurotransmitter 
systems in explaining different degrees of olfactory dysfunction among 
the various neurodegenerative diseases are presently unknown.

The smell loss seen in iRBD is of the same magnitude as that found 
in  PD.  This  is  of  particular  interest  because  patients  with  iRBD  fre-
quently develop PD and hyposmia. REM behavior disorder is not only 
seen in its idiopathic form, but can also be associated with narcolepsy 
(Chap.  31).  A  study  of  narcoleptic  patients  with  and  without  REM 
behavior disorder demonstrated that narcolepsy, independent of REM 
behavior disorder, was associated with impairments in olfactory func-
tion. Loss of hypothalamic neurons expressing orexin (also known as 
hypocretin) neuropeptides is believed to be responsible for narcolepsy 
and  cataplexy.  Orexin-containing  neurons  project  throughout  the 
entire  olfactory  system  (from  the  olfactory  epithelium  to  the  olfac-
tory cortex), and damage to these projections may be one underlying 
mechanism for impaired olfactory performance in narcoleptic patients. 
Administration of intranasal orexin A (hypocretin-1) improved olfac-
tory  function,  supporting  the  notion  that  mild  olfactory  impairment 
is  not  only  a  primary  feature  of  narcolepsy  with  cataplexy,  but  that 
orexin deficiency may be directly responsible for the loss of smell in 
this condition.

 ■ DISORDERS OF TASTE
The  majority  of  patients  who  present  with  taste  dysfunction  exhibit 
olfactory, not taste, loss. This is because most flavors attributed to taste 
actually  depend  on  retronasal  stimulation  of  the  olfactory  receptors 
during  deglutition.  As  noted  earlier,  taste  buds  only  mediate  basic 
tastes such as sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. Significant impair-
ment of whole-mouth gustatory function is rare outside of generalized 
metabolic disturbances or systemic use of some medications, because 
taste  bud  regeneration  occurs  and  peripheral  damage  alone  would 
require the involvement of multiple CN pathways. Taste function can 
be influenced by age, diet, smoking behavior, use of medications, and 
other  subject-related  factors  including  (1)  the  release  of  foul-tasting 
materials  from  the  oral  cavity  from  oral  medical  conditions  (e.g., 
gingivitis, purulent sialadenitis) or appliances; (2) transport problems 
of tastants to the taste buds (e.g., drying, infections, or inflammatory 
conditions  of  the  orolingual  mucosa),  (3)  damage  to  the  taste  buds 
themselves  (e.g.,  local  trauma,  invasive  carcinomas),  (4)  damage  to 
the neural pathways innervating the taste buds (e.g., middle ear infec-
tions), (5) damage to central structures (e.g., multiple sclerosis, tumor, 
epilepsy,  stroke),  and  (6)  systemic  disturbances  of  metabolism  (e.g., 
diabetes, thyroid disease, medications).

Unlike CN VII, CN IX is relatively protected along its path, although 
iatrogenic  interventions  such  as  tonsillectomy,  bronchoscopy,  laryn-
goscopy, endotracheal intubation, and radiation therapy can result in 
selective  injury.  CN  VII  damage  commonly  results  from  mastoidec-
tomy, tympanoplasty, and stapedectomy, in some cases inducing per-
sistent metallic sensations. Bell’s palsy (Chap. 441) is one of the most 
common causes of CN VII injury that results in taste disturbance. On 

rare  occasions,  migraine  (Chap.  430)  is  associated  with  a  gustatory 
prodrome or aura, and in some cases, tastants can trigger a migraine 
attack. Interestingly, dysgeusia occurs in some cases of burning mouth 
syndrome  (also  termed  glossodynia  or  glossalgia),  as  does  dry  mouth 
and thirst. Burning mouth syndrome is likely associated with dysfunc-
tion of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Some of the etiologies suggested 
for  this  poorly  understood  syndrome  are  amenable  to  treatment, 
including (1) nutritional deficiencies (e.g., iron, folic acid, B vitamins, 
zinc), (2) diabetes mellitus (possibly predisposing to oral candidiasis), 
(3)  denture  allergy,  (4)  mechanical  irritation  from  dentures  or  oral 
devices, (5) repetitive movements of the mouth (e.g., tongue thrusting, 
teeth grinding, jaw clenching), (6) tongue ischemia as a result of tem-
poral arteritis, (7) periodontal disease, (8) reflux esophagitis, and (9) 
geographic tongue.

Although both taste and smell can be adversely influenced by drugs, 
taste  alterations  are  more  common.  Indeed,  >250  medications  have 
been  reported  to  alter  the  ability  to  taste.  Major  offenders  include 
antineoplastic agents, antirheumatic drugs, antibiotics, and blood pres-
sure medications. Terbinafine, a commonly used antifungal, has been 
linked to taste disturbance lasting up to 3 years. In a recent controlled 
trial, nearly two-thirds of individuals taking eszopiclone (Lunesta) for 
insomnia experienced a bitter dysgeusia that was stronger in women, 
systematically  related  to  the  time  since  drug  administration,  and 
positively  correlated  with  both  blood  and  saliva  levels  of  the  drug. 
Intranasal  use  of  nasal  gels  and  sprays  containing  zinc,  which  are 
common  over-the-counter  prophylactics  for  upper  respiratory  viral 
infections, has been implicated in loss of smell function. Whether their 
efficacy  in  preventing  such  infections,  which  are  the  most  common 
cause of anosmia and hyposmia, outweighs their potential detriment 
to  smell  function  requires  study.  Dysgeusia  occurs  commonly  in  the 
context of drugs used to treat or minimize symptoms of cancer, with a 
weighted prevalence from 56% to 76% depending on the type of cancer 
treatment. Attempts to prevent taste problems from such drugs using 
prophylactic  zinc  sulfate  or  amifostine  have  proven  to  be  minimally 
beneficial.  Although  antiepileptic  medications  are  occasionally  used 
to  treat  smell  or  taste  disturbances,  the  use  of  topiramate  has  been 
reported to result in a reversible loss of an ability to detect and recog-
nize tastes and odors during treatment.

As with olfaction, a number of systemic disorders can affect taste. 
These include, but are not limited to, chronic renal failure, end-stage 
liver disease, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, diabetes mellitus, and 
hypothyroidism. In diabetes, there appears to be a progressive loss of 
taste beginning with glucose and then extending to other sweeteners, 
salty stimuli, and then all stimuli. Psychiatric conditions can be asso-
ciated with chemosensory alterations (e.g., depression, schizophrenia, 
bulimia).  A  recent  review  of  tactile,  gustatory,  and  olfactory  halluci-
nations demonstrated that no one type of hallucinatory experience is 
pathognomonic to any given diagnosis.

Pregnancy  is  a  unique  condition  with  regard  to  taste  function. 
There appears to be an increase in dislike and intensity of bitter tastes 
during the first trimester that may help to ensure that pregnant women 
avoid poisons during a critical phase of fetal development. Similarly, a 
relative increase in the preference for salt and bitter in the second and 
third trimesters may support the ingestion of much needed electrolytes 
to expand fluid volume and support a varied diet.

 ■ CLINICAL EVALUATION
In most cases, a careful clinical history will establish the probable etiol-
ogy of a chemosensory problem, including questions about its nature, 
onset,  duration,  and  pattern  of  fluctuations.  Sudden  loss  suggests 
the  possibility  of  head  trauma,  ischemia,  infection,  or  a  psychiatric 
condition.  Gradual  loss  can  reflect  the  development  of  a  progressive 
obstructive lesion, although gradual loss can also follow head trauma. 
Intermittent  loss  suggests  the  likelihood  of  an  inflammatory  process. 
The patient should be asked about potential precipitating events, such 
as cold or flu infections, prior to symptom onset, because these often 
go  underappreciated.  Information  regarding  head  trauma,  smoking 
habits, drug and alcohol abuse (e.g., intranasal cocaine, chronic alco-
holism),  exposures  to  pesticides  and  other  toxic  agents,  and  medical

interventions  is  also  informative.  A  determination  of  all  the  medica-
tions  that  the  patient  was  taking  before  and  at  the  time  of  symptom 
onset  is  important,  because  many  can  cause  chemosensory  distur-
bances.  Comorbid  medical  conditions  associated  with  smell  impair-
ment,  such  as  renal  failure,  liver  disease,  hypothyroidism,  diabetes, 
or dementia, should be assessed. Delayed puberty in association with 
anosmia (with or without midline craniofacial abnormalities, deafness, 
and renal anomalies) suggests the possibility of Kallmann’s syndrome. 
Recollection of epistaxis, discharge (clear, purulent, or bloody), nasal 
obstruction,  allergies,  and  somatic  symptoms,  including  headache  or 
irritation, may have localizing value. Questions related to memory, par-
kinsonian symptoms, and seizure activity (e.g., automatisms, blackouts, 
auras, déjà vu) should be posed. Pending litigation and the possibility 
of malingering should be considered. Modern forced-choice olfactory 
tests can detect malingering from improbable responses.

Neurologic  and  otorhinolaryngologic  (ORL)  examinations,  along 
with appropriate brain and nasosinus imaging, aid in the evaluation of 
patients with olfactory or gustatory complaints. The neural evaluation 
should focus on CN function, with particular attention to possible skull 
base and intracranial lesions. Visual acuity, field, and optic disc exami-
nations aid in detection of intracranial mass lesions that produce raised 
intracranial pressure (papilledema) and optic atrophy. Foster Kennedy 
syndrome refers to raised intracranial pressure plus a compressive optic 
neuropathy; typical causes are olfactory groove meningiomas or other 
frontal  lobe  tumors.  The  ORL  examination  should  thoroughly  assess 
the intranasal architecture and mucosal surfaces. Polyps, masses, and 
adhesions of the turbinates to the septum may compromise the flow of 
air to the olfactory receptors, because less than a fifth of the inspired 
air  traverses  the  olfactory  cleft  in  the  unobstructed  state.  Blood  tests 
may be helpful to identify such conditions as diabetes, infection, heavy 
metal exposure, nutritional deficiency (e.g., vitamin B6 or B12), allergy, 
and thyroid, liver, and kidney disease.

As  with  other  sensory  disorders,  quantitative  sensory  testing  is 
advised.  Self-reports  of  patients  can  be  misleading,  and  a  number  of 
patients  who  complain  of  chemosensory  dysfunction  have  normal 
function for their age and gender. Quantitative smell and taste testing 
provides  objective  information  for  worker’s  compensation  and  other 
legal claims, as well as a way to accurately assess the effects of treat-
ment interventions. A number of standardized olfactory and taste tests 
are  commercially  available.  The  most  widely  used  olfactory  test,  the 
40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), 
uses  norms  based  on  nearly  4000  normal  subjects.  A  determination 
is  made  of  both  absolute  dysfunction  (i.e.,  mild  loss,  moderate  loss, 
severe loss, total loss, probable malingering) and relative dysfunction 
(percentile rank for age and gender). Although electrophysiologic test-
ing is available at some smell and taste centers (e.g., odor event-related 
potentials), they require complex stimulus presentation and recording 
equipment and rarely provide additional diagnostic information. With 
the exception of electrogustometers, commercially available taste tests 
have  only  recently  become  available.  Most  use  filter  paper  strips  or 
similar materials impregnated with tastants, so no stimulus preparation 
is required.

 ■ TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Given  the  various  mechanisms  by  which  olfactory  and  gustatory 
disturbance can occur, management of patients tends to be condition- 
specific. For example, patients with hypothyroidism, diabetes, or infec-
tions often benefit from specific treatments to correct the underlying 
disease process that is adversely influencing chemoreception. For most 
patients who present primarily with obstructive/transport loss affect-
ing  the  nasal  and  paranasal  regions  (e.g.,  allergic  rhinitis,  polyposis, 
intranasal neoplasms, nasal deviations), medical and/or surgical inter-
vention  is  often  beneficial.  Antifungal  and  antibiotic  treatments  may 
reverse taste problems secondary to candidiasis or other oral infections. 
Chlorhexidine  mouthwash  mitigates  some  salty  or  bitter  dysgeusias, 
conceivably as a result of its strong positive charge. Excessive dryness 
of the oral mucosa is a problem with many medications and conditions, 
and artificial saliva (e.g., Xerolube) or oral pilocarpine treatments may 
prove beneficial. Other methods to improve salivary flow include the 

use of mints, lozenges, or sugarless gum. Flavor enhancers may make 
food  more  palatable  (e.g.,  monosodium  glutamate),  but  caution  is 
advised  to  avoid  overusing  ingredients  containing  sodium  or  sugar, 
particularly  in  circumstances  when  a  patient  also  has  underlying 
hypertension or diabetes. Medications that induce distortions of taste 
can often be discontinued and replaced with other types of medications 
or modes of therapy. As mentioned earlier, pharmacologic agents result 
in taste disturbances much more frequently than smell disturbances. It 
is important to note, however, that many drug-related effects are long 
lasting and not reversed by short-term drug discontinuance.

A  study  of  endoscopic  sinus  surgery  in  patients  with  chronic  rhi-
nosinusitis and hyposmia revealed that patients with severe olfactory 
dysfunction  prior  to  the  surgery  had  a  more  dramatic  and  sustained 
improvement over time compared to patients with more mild olfactory 
dysfunction prior to intervention. In the case of intranasal and sinus- 
related  inflammatory  conditions,  such  as  seen  with  allergy,  viruses, 
and  traumas,  the  use  of  intranasal  or  systemic  glucocorticoids  may 
also be helpful. One common approach is to use a tapering course of 
oral  prednisone.  Topical  intranasal  administration  of  glucocorticoids 
was  found  to  be  less  effective  in  general  than  systemic  administra-
tion; however, the effects of different nasal administration techniques 
were  not  analyzed.  For  example,  intranasal  glucocorticoids  are  more 
effective if administered in the Moffett’s position (head in the inverted 
position such as over the edge of the bed with the bridge of the nose 
perpendicular to the floor). After head trauma, an initial trial of glu-
cocorticoids may help to reduce local edema and the potential delete-
rious deposition of scar tissue around olfactory fila at the level of the 
cribriform plate.

Treatments are limited for patients with chemosensory loss or pri-
mary  injury  to  neural  pathways.  Nonetheless,  spontaneous  recovery 
can occur. In a follow-up study of 542 patients presenting to our center 
with smell loss from a variety of causes, modest improvement occurred 
over an average time period of 4 years in about half of the participants. 
However, only 11% of the anosmic and 23% of the hyposmic patients 
regained  normal  age-related  function.  Interestingly,  the  amount  of 
dysfunction  at  the  time  of  presentation,  not  etiology,  was  the  best 
predictor of prognosis. Other predictors were age and the duration of 
dysfunction prior to initial testing.

Several studies have reported that patients with hyposmia may bene-
fit from repeated smelling of odors over the course of weeks or months, 
although it remains to be determined how much improvement, if any, 
occurs over that known to occur spontaneously. The usual paradigm is 
to smell odors such as eucalyptol, citronella, eugenol, and phenyl ethyl 
alcohol before going to bed and immediately upon awakening each day. 
The rationale for such an approach comes from animal studies demon-
strating  that  prolonged  exposure  to  odorants  can  induce  increased 
neural activity within the olfactory bulb. There is also limited evidence 
that α-lipoic acid (400 mg/d), an essential cofactor for many enzyme 
complexes with possible antioxidant effects, may be beneficial in miti-
gating smell loss following viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. 
However, double-blind studies are needed to confirm this observation. 
α-Lipoic  acid  has  also  been  suggested  to  be  useful  in  some  cases  of 
hypogeusia and burning mouth syndrome.

The use of zinc and vitamin A in treating olfactory disturbances is 
controversial,  and  there  does  not  appear  to  be  much  benefit  beyond 
replenishing established deficiencies. However, zinc has been shown to 
improve taste function secondary to hepatic deficiencies, and retinoids 
(bioactive  vitamin  A  derivatives)  are  known  to  play  an  essential  role 
in the survival of olfactory neurons. One protocol in which zinc was 
infused with chemotherapy treatments suggested a possible protective 
effect against developing taste impairment. Diseases of the alimentary 
tract  can  not  only  influence  chemoreceptive  function  but  also  occa-
sionally influence vitamin B12 absorption. This can result in a relative 
deficiency of vitamin B12, theoretically contributing to olfactory nerve 
disturbance.  Vitamin  B2  (riboflavin)  and  magnesium  supplements 
are  reported  in  the  alternative  literature  to  aid  in  the  management 
of  migraine  that,  in  turn,  may  be  associated  with  smell  dysfunction. 
Because vitamin D deficiency is a cofactor of chemotherapy-induced 
mucocutaneous toxicity and dysgeusia, adding vitamin D3, 1000–2000

units  per  day,  may  benefit  some  patients  with  smell  and  taste  com-
plaints during or following chemotherapy.

A number of medications have reportedly been used with success in 
ameliorating olfactory symptoms, although strong scientific evidence 
for efficacy is generally lacking. A report that theophylline improved 
smell function was uncontrolled and failed to account for the fact that 
some meaningful improvement occurs without treatment; indeed, the 
percentage of responders was about the same (~50%) as that noted by 
others to show spontaneous improvement over a similar time period. 
Antiepileptics and some antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) have been 
used  to  treat  dysosmias  and  smell  distortions,  particularly  following 
head  trauma.  Ironically,  amitriptyline  is  also  frequently  on  the  list 
of  medications  that  can  ultimately  distort  smell  and  taste  function, 
possibly from its anticholinergic effects. One study suggested that the 
centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil in AD resulted 
in improvements on smell identification measures that correlated with 
overall  clinician-based  impressions  of  change  in  dementia  severity 
scores.

Alternative  therapies,  such  as  acupuncture,  meditation,  cognitive- 
behavioral therapy, and yoga, can help patients manage uncomfortable 
experiences associated with chemosensory disturbance and oral pain 
syndromes  and  to  cope  with  the  psychosocial  stressors  surrounding 
the  impairment.  Additionally,  modification  of  diet  and  eating  habits 
is  also  important.  By  accentuating  the  other  sensory  experiences  of 
a meal, such as food texture, aroma, temperature, and color, one can 
optimize the overall eating experience for a patient. In some cases, a 
flavor enhancer like monosodium glutamate (MSG) can be added to 
foods to increase palatability and encourage intake.

Proper oral and nasal hygiene and routine dental care are extremely 
important  ways  for  patients  to  protect  themselves  from  disorders  of 
the mouth and nose that can ultimately result in chemosensory distur-
bance. Patients should be warned not to overcompensate for their taste 
loss by adding excessive amounts of sugar or salt. Smoking cessation 
and the discontinuance of oral tobacco use are essential in the man-
agement of any patient with smell and/or taste disturbance and should 
be repeatedly emphasized.

A major and often overlooked element of therapy comes from che-
mosensory testing itself. Confirmation or lack of conformation of loss 
is beneficial to patients who come to believe, in light of unsupportive 
family  members  and  medical  providers,  that  they  may  be  “crazy.”  In 
cases where the loss is minor, patients can be informed of the likeli-
hood  of  a  more  positive  prognosis.  Importantly,  quantitative  testing 
places the patient’s problem into overall perspective. Thus, it is often 
therapeutic  for  an  older  person  to  know  that,  while  his  or  her  smell 
function is not what it used to be, it still falls above the average of his 
or her peer group. Without testing, many such patients are simply told 
that they are getting old and nothing can be done for them, leading in 
some cases to depression and decreased self-esteem.

34 Disorders of Hearing

Anil K. Lalwani

Hearing loss can present at any age and is one of the most common 
sensory disorders in humans. Nearly 10% of the adult population has 
some hearing loss, and one-third of individuals age >65 years have a 
hearing loss of sufficient magnitude to require a hearing aid.

PHYSIOLOGY OF HEARING
The  function  of  the  external  and  middle  ear  is  to  amplify  sound  to 
facilitate conversion of the mechanical energy of the sound wave into 
an electrical signal by the inner-ear hair cells, a process called mecha-
notransduction  (Fig.  34-1).  Sound  waves  enter  the  external  auditory 
canal and set the tympanic membrane (eardrum) in motion, which in 
turn moves the malleus, incus, and stapes of the middle ear. Movement 
of the footplate of the stapes causes pressure changes in the fluid-filled 
inner  ear,  eliciting  a  traveling  wave  in  the  basilar  membrane  of  the 
cochlea. The tympanic membrane and the ossicular chain in the mid-
dle  ear  serve  as  an  impedance-matching  mechanism,  improving  the 
efficiency of energy transfer from air to the fluid-filled inner ear. In its 
absence, nearly 99.9% of the acoustical energy would be reflected and 
thus not heard. Instead, the eardrum and the ossicles boost the sound 
energy nearly 200-fold by the time it reaches the inner ear.

Within the cochlea of the inner ear, there are two types of hair cells 
that aid in hearing: inner and outer. The inner and outer hair cells of 
the  organ  of  Corti  have  different  innervation  patterns,  but  both  are 
mechanoreceptors; they detect the mechanical energy of the acoustic 
signal and aid its conversion to an electrical signal that travels by the 
auditory nerve. The afferent innervation relates principally to the inner 
hair cells while the efferent innervation relates principally to the outer 
hair cells. The outer hair cells outnumber the inner hair cells by nearly 
6:1  (20,000  vs  3500).  The  motility  of  the  outer  hair  cells  alters  the 
micromechanics of the inner hair cells, creating a cochlear amplifier, 
which  explains  the  exquisite  sensitivity  and  frequency  selectivity  of 
the cochlea.

Stereocilia of the hair cells of the organ of Corti, which rests on the 
basilar  membrane,  are  in  contact  with  the  tectorial  membrane  and 
are  deformed  by  the  traveling  wave.  The  deformation  stretches  tiny 
filamentous  connections  (tip  links)  between  stereocilia,  leading  to 
opening of ion channels, influx of potassium, and hair cell depolariza-
tion and subsequent neurotransmission. A point of maximal displace-
ment of the basilar membrane is determined by the frequency of the 
stimulating  tone.  High-frequency  tones  cause  maximal  displacement 
of the basilar membrane near the base of the cochlea, whereas for low- 
frequency  sounds,  the  point  of  maximal  displacement  is  toward  the 
apex of the cochlea.

Beginning in the cochlea, the frequency specificity is maintained at 
each point of the central auditory pathway: dorsal and ventral cochlear 
nuclei,  trapezoid  body,  superior  olivary  complex,  lateral  lemniscus, 
inferior  colliculus,  medial  geniculate  body,  and  auditory  cortex.  At 
low frequencies, individual auditory nerve fibers can respond more or 
less  synchronously  with  the  stimulating  tone.  At  higher  frequencies, 
phase-locking occurs so that neurons alternate in response to partic-
ular phases of the cycle of the sound wave. Intensity is encoded by the

amount of neural activity in individual neurons, the number of neu-
rons that are active, and the specific neurons that are activated.

There is evidence that the right and left ears as well as the central 
nervous system may process speech asymmetrically. Generally, a sound 
is processed symmetrically from the peripheral to the central auditory 
system.  However,  a  “right  ear  advantage”  exists  for  dichotic  listening 
tasks, in which subjects are asked to report on competing sounds pre-
sented to each ear. In most individuals, a perceptual right ear advantage 
for consonant-vowel syllables, stop consonants, and words also exists. 
Similarly, whereas central auditory processing for sounds is symmetric 
with minimal lateral specialization for the most part, speech process-
ing  is  lateralized.  There  is  specialization  of  the  left  auditory  cortex  
for speech recognition and production, and of the right hemisphere 
for  emotional  and  tonal  aspects  of  speech.  Left  hemisphere  dom-
inance  for  speech  is  found  in  95–98%  of  right-handed  persons  and 
70–80% of left-handed persons.
 ■ DISORDERS OF THE SENSE OF HEARING
Hearing loss can result from disorders of the auricle, external auditory 
canal, middle ear, inner ear, or central auditory pathways (Fig. 34-2). 
In general, lesions in the auricle, external auditory canal, or middle ear 
that impede the transmission of sound from the external environment 
to  the  inner  ear  cause  conductive  hearing  loss,  whereas  lesions  that 
impair  mechanotransduction  in  the  inner  ear  or  transmission  of  the 
electrical signal along the eighth nerve to the brain cause sensorineural 
hearing loss.
Conductive Hearing Loss  The external ear, the external auditory 
canal, and the middle-ear apparatus are designed to collect and amplify 
sound and efficiently transfer the mechanical energy of the sound wave 
to  the  fluid-filled  cochlea.  Factors  that  obstruct  the  transmission  of 
sound or dampen the acoustic energy result in conductive hearing loss. 
Conductive  hearing  loss  can  occur  from  obstruction  of  the  external 
auditory canal by cerumen, debris, and foreign bodies; swelling of the 
lining of the canal; atresia or neoplasms of the canal; perforations of 
the tympanic membrane; disruption of the ossicular chain, as occurs 
with necrosis of the long process of the incus in trauma or infection; 
otosclerosis; or fluid, scarring, or neoplasms in the middle ear. Rarely, 
inner-ear  malformations  or  pathologies  that  create  a  “third  window” 
in the inner ear such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence, lateral 
semicircular canal dysplasia, incomplete partition of the inner ear, and 
large vestibular aqueduct, are also associated with conductive hearing 
loss. This pathologic third window is associated with loss of mechan-
ical  energy  associated  with  the  sound  wave  leading  to  conductive 
hearing loss (see below).

Eustachian  tube  dysfunction  is  extremely  common  in  adults  and 
may  predispose  to  acute  otitis  media  (AOM)  or  serous  otitis  media 

(SOM).  Recently,  Eustachian  tube  balloon  dilation  has  been  shown 
to  relieve  acquired  inflammatory  obstruction  of  the  Eustachian  tube 
orifice  and  improve  symptoms  due  to  Eustachian  tube  dysfunction. 
Trauma, AOM, and chronic otitis media are the usual factors respon-
sible  for  tympanic  membrane  perforation.  While  small  perforations 
often heal spontaneously, larger defects usually require surgical inter-
vention.  Tympanoplasty  is  highly  effective  (>90%)  in  the  repair  of 
tympanic  membrane  perforations.  Otoscopy  is  usually  sufficient  to 
diagnose  AOM,  SOM,  chronic  otitis  media,  cerumen  impaction, 
tympanic  membrane  perforation,  and  Eustachian  tube  dysfunction; 
tympanometry and Eustachian tube function testing can be useful to 
confirm the clinical suspicion of these conditions.

Cholesteatoma, a benign tumor composed of stratified squamous epi-
thelium in the middle ear or mastoid, occurs frequently in adults, often 
in  the  setting  of  severe  Eustachian  tube  dysfunction.  This  is  a  slowly 
growing  lesion  that  destroys  bone  and  normal  ear  tissue.  Theories  of 
pathogenesis include traumatic immigration and invasion of squamous 
epithelium  through  a  retraction  pocket  of  the  tympanic  membrane, 
implantation  of  squamous  epithelia  in  the  middle  ear  through  a  per-
foration  or  surgery,  and  metaplasia  following  chronic  infection  and 
irritation. A chronically draining ear that fails to respond to appropriate 
antibiotic therapy should raise suspicion of a cholesteatoma. On exami-
nation,  there  is  often  a  perforation  of  the  tympanic  membrane  filled 
with  cheesy  white  squamous  debris.  The  presence  of  an  aural  polyp 
obscuring  the  tympanic  membrane  is  highly  suggestive  of  an  under-
lying  cholesteatoma.  Conductive  hearing  loss  secondary  to  ossicular 
erosion is common. Bony destruction visualized on CT of the temporal 
bone is also highly suggestive of cholesteatoma. Surgery is required to 
remove this destructive process and reconstruct the ossicles.

Conductive  hearing  loss  with  a  normal  ear  canal  and  intact  tym-
panic  membrane  suggests  either  ossicular  pathology  or  the  presence 
of a “third window” in the inner ear (see below). Fixation of the stapes 
from  otosclerosis  is  a  common  cause  of  low-frequency  conductive 
hearing  loss.  It  occurs  equally  in  men  and  women  and  is  inherited 
as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance; in some 
cases,  it  may  be  a  manifestation  of  osteogenesis  imperfecta.  Hearing 
impairment usually presents between the late teens and the forties. In 
women, the otosclerotic process is accelerated during pregnancy, and 
the hearing loss is often first noticeable at this time. A hearing aid or 
a  simple  outpatient  surgical  procedure  (stapedectomy)  can  provide 
excellent auditory rehabilitation. Extension of otosclerosis beyond the 
stapes footplate to involve the cochlea (cochlear otosclerosis) can lead 
to  mixed  or  sensorineural  hearing  loss.  Fluoride  therapy  to  prevent 
hearing loss from cochlear otosclerosis is of uncertain value.

Disorders that lead to the formation of a pathologic “third window” 
in the inner ear can be associated with conductive hearing loss. There

are normally two major openings, or windows, that connect the inner 
ear  with  the  middle  ear  and  serve  as  conduits  for  transmission  of 
sound;  these  are,  respectively,  the  oval  and  round  windows.  A  third 
window  is  formed  where  the  normally  hard  otic  bone  surrounding 
the inner ear is eroded; dissipation of the acoustic energy at the third 
window is responsible for the “inner-ear conductive hearing loss.” The 
superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome resulting from ero-
sion of the otic bone over the superior circular canal can present with 
conductive hearing loss that mimics otosclerosis. A common symptom 
is  vertigo  evoked  by  loud  sounds  (Tullio  phenomenon),  by  Valsalva 
maneuvers  that  change  middle-ear  pressure,  or  by  applying  positive 
pressure on the tragus (the cartilage anterior to the external opening 
of the ear canal). Patients with this syndrome also complain of fullness 
of the ear, pulsatile tinnitus, and being able to hear the movement of 
their eyes and neck. A large jugular bulb or jugular bulb diverticulum 
can  create  a  “third  window”  by  eroding  into  the  vestibular  aqueduct 
or posterior semicircular canal; the symptoms are similar to those of 
the superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome. Other inner-ear 
malformations such as lateral semicircular canal dysplasia, large vestib-
ular aqueduct, or incomplete partition seen in stapes gusher syndrome 
can also be associated with inner-ear conductive hearing loss as a result 
of the third window. Low activation threshold on the vestibular-evoked 
myogenic potential test (VEMP test, see below) and inner-ear erosion 
on CT are diagnostic. Recalcitrant vertigo and dizziness may respond 
to surgical repair of the dehiscence.

Sensorineural  Hearing  Loss  Sensorineural  hearing  loss  results 
from  either  damage  to  the  mechanotransduction  apparatus  of  the 
cochlea  or  disruption  of  the  electrical  conduction  pathway  from  the 
inner  ear  to  the  brain.  Thus,  injury  to  hair  cells,  supporting  cells, 

auditory neurons, or the central auditory pathway can cause sensori-
neural hearing loss. Damage to the hair cells of the organ of Corti may 
be caused by intense noise, viral infections, ototoxic drugs (e.g., salicy-
lates, quinine and its synthetic analogues, aminoglycoside antibiotics, 
loop  diuretics  such  as  furosemide  and  ethacrynic  acid,  and  cancer 
chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin), fractures of the temporal 
bone, meningitis, cochlear otosclerosis (see above), Ménière’s disease, 
and aging. Congenital malformations of the inner ear may be the cause 
of hearing loss in some adults. Genetic predisposition alone or in con-
cert with environmental exposures may also be responsible (see below).

Noise-Induced  Hearing  Loss  Exposure  to  loud  noise,  either 
a  short  burst  or  over  a  more  prolonged  period  of  time,  can  lead  to 
noise-induced hearing loss. Acute exposure to noise can lead to either 
temporary or permanent threshold shifts, depending on the intensity 
and duration of sound, due to hair cell injury and/or death. Typically, 
with  permanent  hearing  loss  there  is  a  “noise  notch”  with  elevated 
hearing thresholds at 3000–4000 Hz. More recently, loud noise expo-
sure  has  also  been  associated  with  “hidden  hearing  loss”—hidden, 
because routine audiometry shows the pure tone hearing to be normal. 
Patients usually complain of not being able to hear clearly and are more 
bothered by the presence of background noise. In contrast to hair cell 
loss, hidden hearing loss is thought to be due to loss of auditory syn-
apses on hair cells following noise exposure. In an increasingly noisy 
world,  avoiding  acoustic  trauma  with  earplugs  or  earmuffs  is  highly 
recommended to prevent noise-induced or hidden hearing loss.

Presbycusis (age-associated hearing loss) is the most common cause 
of  sensorineural  hearing  loss  in  adults.  It  is  estimated  to  affect  over 
half of adults aged >75 years in the United States, a population that is 
expected to double in size over the next 40 years. In the early stages, it is

FIGURE  34-3  Presbycusis  or  age-related  hearing  loss.  The  audiogram  shows  a 
moderate to severe downsloping sensorineural hearing loss typical of presbycusis. 
The  loss  of  high-frequency  hearing  is  associated  with  a  decreased  speech 
discrimination score; consequently, patients complain of lack of clarity of hearing, 
especially in a noisy background. HL, hearing threshold level; SRT, speech reception

characterized by symmetric, gentle to sharply sloping, high-frequency 
hearing loss (Fig. 34-3). With progression, the hearing loss involves all 
frequencies.  More  importantly,  the  hearing  impairment  is  associated 
with  significant  loss  in  clarity.  There  is  a  loss  of  discrimination  for 
phonemes, recruitment (abnormal growth of loudness), and particular 
difficulty  in  understanding  speech  in  noisy  environments  such  as  at 
restaurants and social events. Poor hearing is also associated with an 
increased incidence of cognitive impairment, rate of cognitive decline, 
and falls. In the elderly, left untreated, hearing loss leads to diminished 
quality of life, and has been shown to increase overall morbidity and 
mortality  through  falls  and  accidents.  Hearing  aids  are  helpful  in 
enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio by amplifying sounds that are close 
to  the  listener.  Hearing  aid  use  has  been  shown  to  reduce  cognitive 
decline  and  risk  of  falls.  Although  hearing  aids  are  able  to  amplify 
sounds, they cannot restore the clarity of hearing. Thus, amplification 
with  hearing  aids  may  provide  only  limited  rehabilitation  once  the 
word  recognition  score  deteriorates  below  50%.  Cochlear  implants 
are the treatment of choice when hearing aids prove inadequate, even 
when hearing loss is incomplete (see below).

Ménière’s  disease  is  characterized  by  episodic  vertigo,  fluctuating 
sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. An absence of 
vertigo is inconsistent with the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease, and the 
presence  of  fluctuating  sensorineural  hearing  loss,  tinnitus,  and  full-
ness without vertigo is more suggestive of cochlear hydrops. Tinnitus 
and/or deafness may be absent during the initial attacks of vertigo, but 
invariably appear as the disease progresses and increases in severity during 
acute attacks. The annual incidence of Ménière’s disease is 0.5–7.5 per 
1000; onset is most frequently in the fifth decade of life but may also 
occur  in  young  adults  or  the  elderly.  Histologically,  there  is  disten-
tion  of  the  endolymphatic  system  (endolymphatic  hydrops)  leading 
to degeneration of vestibular and cochlear hair cells. This may result 
from  endolymphatic  sac  dysfunction  secondary  to  infection,  trauma, 
autoimmune disease, inflammatory causes, or tumor; an idiopathic eti-
ology constitutes the largest category and is most accurately referred to 
as Ménière’s disease. Endolymphatic sac tumors, often associated with 
von  Hippel  Lindau  disease,  may  clinically  mimic  Ménière’s  disease. 
Although any pattern of hearing loss can be observed, typically, low-
frequency, unilateral sensorineural hearing impairment is present. An 
abnormal VEMP test (see below) may be helpful in detecting Ménière’s 
disease  in  a  clinically  unaffected  contralateral  ear.  MRI  should  be 
obtained  to  exclude  retrocochlear  pathology  such  as  a  cerebellopon-
tine angle tumor, endolymphatic sac tumor, or demyelinating disorder. 
Therapy is directed toward the control of vertigo. A 2-g/d low-salt diet

is the mainstay of treatment for control of rotatory vertigo. Diuretics, a 
short course of oral glucocorticoids, intratympanic glucocorticoids, or 
intratympanic gentamicin may also be useful adjuncts in recalcitrant 
cases.  Surgical  therapy  of  vertigo  is  reserved  for  unresponsive  cases 
and includes endolymphatic sac decompression, labyrinthectomy, and 
vestibular  nerve  section.  Both  labyrinthectomy  and  vestibular  nerve 
section abolish rotatory vertigo in >90% of cases. Unfortunately, there 
is no effective therapy for hearing loss, tinnitus, or aural fullness from 
Ménière’s disease.

Sensorineural  hearing  loss  may  also  result  from  any  neoplastic, 
vascular,  demyelinating,  infectious,  degenerative  disease,  or  trauma 
affecting  the  central  auditory  pathways.  Characteristically,  in  hearing 
loss due to central nervous system pathology, a reduction in clarity of 
hearing and speech comprehension is much greater than the loss of the 
ability to hear pure tone. Auditory testing is consistent with an auditory 
neuropathy;  normal  otoacoustic  emissions  (OAEs)  and  an  abnormal 
auditory  brainstem  response  (ABR)  are  typical  (see  below).  Hearing 
loss can accompany hereditary sensorimotor neuropathies and inher-
ited disorders of myelin. Tumors of the cerebellopontine angle such as 
vestibular  schwannoma  and  meningioma  (Chap.  90)  usually  present 
with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss with greater deterioration 
of  speech  understanding  than  pure  tone  hearing.  Multiple  sclerosis 
(Chap.  444)  may  present  with  acute  unilateral  or  bilateral  hearing 
loss; typically, pure tone testing remains relatively stable while speech 
understanding  fluctuates.  Isolated  labyrinthine  infarction  can  present 
with acute hearing loss and vertigo due to a cerebrovascular accident 
involving the posterior circulation, usually the anterior inferior cerebel-
lar artery; it may also be the heralding sign of impending catastrophic 
basilar artery infarction (Chap. 426). HIV (Chap. 202), which can pro-
duce both peripheral and central auditory system pathology, is another 
consideration in the evaluation of sensorineural hearing impairment.

A  finding  of  conductive  and  sensorineural  hearing  loss  in  combi-
nation  is  termed  mixed  hearing  loss.  Mixed  hearing  losses  can  result 
from pathology of both the middle and inner ear, as can occur in oto-
sclerosis involving the ossicles and the cochlea, head trauma, chronic 
otitis  media,  cholesteatoma,  middle-ear  tumors,  and  some  inner-ear 
malformations.

Trauma resulting in temporal bone fractures may be associated with 
conductive, sensorineural, or mixed hearing loss. If the fracture spares 
the inner ear, there may simply be conductive hearing loss due to rup-
ture of the tympanic membrane or disruption of the ossicular chain. 
These abnormalities can be surgically corrected. Profound hearing loss 
and severe vertigo are associated with temporal bone fractures involv-
ing  the  inner  ear.  A  perilymphatic  fistula  associated  with  leakage  of 
inner-ear fluid into the middle ear can occur and may require surgical 
repair. An associated facial nerve injury is not uncommon. CT is best 
suited  to  assess  fracture  of  the  traumatized  temporal  bone,  evaluate 
the  ear  canal,  and  determine  the  integrity  of  the  ossicular  chain  and 
involvement of the inner ear. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks that accompany 
temporal bone fractures are usually self-limited; the value of prophy-
lactic antibiotics is uncertain.

Tinnitus  Tinnitus  is  defined  as  the  perception  of  a  sound  when 
there is no sound in the environment. It can have a buzzing, roaring, or 
ringing quality and may be pulsatile (synchronous with the heartbeat). 
Tinnitus is often associated with either a conductive or sensorineural 
hearing loss. The pathophysiology of tinnitus is not well understood. 
The  cause  of  the  tinnitus  can  usually  be  determined  by  finding  the 
cause of the associated hearing loss. Tinnitus may be the first symptom 
of a serious condition such as a vestibular schwannoma. Pulsatile tin-
nitus requires evaluation of the vascular system of the head to exclude 
vascular  tumors  such  as  glomus  jugulare  tumors,  aneurysms,  dural 
arteriovenous  fistulas,  and  stenotic  arterial  lesions;  it  may  also  occur 
with SOM, superior semicircular dehiscence, and inner-ear dehiscence. 
It is most commonly associated with some abnormality of the jugular 
bulb  such  as  a  large  jugular  bulb  or  jugular  bulb  diverticulum.  In 
absence of demonstrated pathology on MRA/MRV or CT angiography, 
pulsatile tinnitus is usually attributed to turbulent venous blood flow 
through the transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and the jugular bulb.

 ■ GENETIC CAUSES OF HEARING LOSS

More than half of childhood hearing impairment is thought to be 
hereditary; hereditary hearing impairment (HHI) can also mani-
fest later in life. HHI may be classified as either nonsyndromic, 
when hearing loss is the only clinical abnormality, or syndromic, when 
hearing  loss  is  associated  with  anomalies  in  other  organ  systems. 
Nearly two-thirds of HHIs are nonsyndromic. Between 70% and 80% 
of nonsyndromic HHI is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner 
and  designated  DFNB;  another  15–20%  is  autosomal  dominant 
(DFNA). Less than 5% is X-linked (DFNX) or maternally inherited via 
the mitochondria.

More  than  150  loci  harboring  genes  for  nonsyndromic  HHI  have 
been mapped, with recessive loci outnumbering dominant ones; numer-
ous  genes  have  now  been  identified  (Table  34-1).  The  hearing  genes 
fall into the categories of structural proteins (MYH9, MYO7A, MYO15, 
TECTA, DIAPH1), transcription factors (POU3F4, POU4F3), ion chan-
nels (KCNQ4, SLC26A4), and gap junction proteins (GJB2, GJB3, GJB6). 
Several of these genes, including GJB2, TECTA, and TMC1, cause both 
autosomal  dominant  and  recessive  forms  of  nonsyndromic  HHI.  In 
general, the hearing loss associated with dominant genes has its onset 
in adolescence or adulthood, varies in severity, and progresses with age, 
whereas  the  hearing  loss  associated  with  recessive  inheritance  is  con-
genital and profound. Connexin 26, a product of the GJB2 gene, is par-
ticularly important because it is responsible for nearly 20% of all cases of 
childhood deafness; half of genetic deafness in children is GJB2 related. 
Two frameshift mutations, 35delG and 167delT, account for >50% of the 
cases; however, screening for these two mutations alone is insufficient, 
and sequencing of the entire gene is required to fully capture GJB2-re-
lated  recessive  deafness.  The  167delT  mutation  is  highly  prevalent  in 
Ashkenazi Jews; ~1 in 1765 individuals in this population is homozy-
gous and affected. GJB2 hearing loss can also vary among the members 
of the same family, suggesting that other genes or factors influence the 
auditory phenotype. A single mutation in GJB2 in combination with a 
single mutation in GJB6 (connexin 30) can also lead to hearing loss and 
is an example of digenic inheritance of hearing loss.

In addition to GJB2, several other nonsyndromic genes are associated 
with hearing loss that progresses with age. The contribution of genetics 
to presbycusis is also becoming better understood and likely reflects a 
combination of genetic susceptibility impacted by environmental expo-
sure to sound. Sensitivity to aminoglycoside ototoxicity can be mater-
nally transmitted through a mitochondrial mutation. Susceptibility to 
noise-induced hearing loss may also be genetically determined.

There are >400 syndromic forms of hearing loss. These include Usher’s 
syndrome  (retinitis  pigmentosa  and  hearing  loss),  Waardenburg’s  syn-
drome  (pigmentary  abnormality  and  hearing  loss),  Pendred’s  syndrome 
(thyroid organification defect and hearing loss), Alport’s syndrome (renal 
disease and hearing loss), Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (prolonged 
QT interval and hearing loss), neurofibromatosis type 2 (bilateral acous-
tic schwannoma), and mitochondrial disorders (mitochondrial enceph-
alopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes [MELAS]; myoclonic 
epilepsy and ragged red fibers [MERRF]; and progressive external oph-
thalmoplegia [PEO]) (Table 34-2).

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Disorders of the Sense of Hearing

The goal in the evaluation of a patient with auditory complaints is to 
determine (1) the nature of the hearing impairment (conductive vs 
sensorineural vs mixed), (2) the severity of the impairment (mild, 
moderate, severe, or profound), (3) the anatomy of the impairment 
(external  ear,  middle  ear,  inner  ear,  or  central  auditory  pathway), 
and  (4)  the  etiology.  The  presence  of  signs  and  symptoms  asso-
ciated  with  hearing  loss  should  be  ascertained  (Table  34-3).  The 
history  should  elicit  characteristics  of  the  hearing  loss,  including 
the  duration  of  deafness,  unilateral  versus  bilateral  involvement, 
nature of onset (sudden vs insidious), and rate of progression (rapid 
vs slow). Symptoms of tinnitus, vertigo, imbalance, aural fullness, 

otorrhea,  headache,  facial  nerve  dysfunction,  and  head  and  neck 
paresthesias should be noted. Information regarding head trauma, 
exposure to ototoxins, occupational or recreational noise exposure, 
and family history of hearing impairment may also be important. 
A sudden onset of unilateral hearing loss, with or without tinnitus, 
may represent a viral infection of the inner ear, vestibular schwan-
noma, or a stroke. Patients with unilateral hearing loss (sensory or 
conductive) usually complain of reduced hearing, poor sound local-
ization, and difficulty hearing clearly in the presence of background 
noise.  Gradual  progression  of  a  hearing  deficit  is  common  with 
otosclerosis,  noise-induced  hearing  loss,  vestibular  schwannoma, 
or Ménière’s disease. Small vestibular schwannomas typically pres-
ent with asymmetric hearing impairment, tinnitus, and imbalance 
(rarely vertigo); cranial neuropathy, in particular of the trigeminal 
or facial nerve, may accompany larger tumors. In addition to hear-
ing loss, Ménière’s disease may be associated with episodic vertigo, 
tinnitus, and aural fullness. Sound-induced vertigo, autophony, and 
being able to hear one’s own neck or eye movement are highly sug-
gestive of superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Hearing loss with 
otorrhea is most likely due to chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma.
Examination  should  include  the  auricle,  external  ear  canal,  and 
tympanic membrane. In the elderly, the external ear canal is often 
dry and fragile; it is preferable to clean cerumen with wall-mounted 
suction or cerumen loops and to avoid irrigation. Irrigation should 
also be avoided when a tympanic membrane perforation is present or 
the integrity of the eardrum cannot be established. In examining the 
eardrum, the topography of the tympanic membrane is more impor-
tant than the presence or absence of the light reflex. In addition to 
the  pars  tensa  (the  lower  two-thirds  of  the  tympanic  membrane), 
the  pars  flaccida  (upper  one-third  of  the  tympanic  membrane) 
above the short process of the malleus should also be examined for 
retraction pockets that may be evidence of chronic Eustachian tube 
dysfunction or cholesteatoma. Insufflation of the ear canal is neces-
sary to assess tympanic membrane mobility and compliance. Careful 
inspection of the nose, nasopharynx, and upper respiratory tract is 
important. Unilateral serous effusion or unexplained otalgia should 
prompt a fiberoptic examination of the nasopharynx and larynx to 
exclude neoplasms. Cranial nerves should be evaluated with special 
attention  to  facial  and  trigeminal  nerves,  which  are  commonly 
affected with tumors involving the cerebellopontine angle.

The  Rinne  and  Weber  tuning  fork  tests,  with  a  512-Hz  tuning 
fork,  are  used  to  screen  for  hearing  loss,  differentiate  conductive 
from  sensorineural  hearing  losses,  and  confirm  the  findings  of 
audiologic evaluation. The Rinne test compares the ability to hear 
by air conduction with the ability to hear by bone conduction. The 
tines  of  a  vibrating  tuning  fork  are  held  near  the  opening  of  the 
external auditory canal, and then the stem is placed on the mastoid 
process; for direct contact, it may be placed on teeth or dentures. 
The patient is asked to indicate whether the tone is louder by air 
conduction or bone conduction. Normally, and in the presence of 
sensorineural hearing loss, a tone is heard louder by air conduction 
than by bone conduction; however, with conductive hearing loss of 
≥30 dB (see “Audiologic Assessment,” below), the bone-conduction 
stimulus  is  perceived  as  louder  than  the  air-conduction  stimulus. 
For the Weber test, the stem of a vibrating tuning fork is placed on 
the head in the midline and the patient is asked whether the tone 
is heard in both ears or better in one ear than in the other. With 
a  unilateral  conductive  hearing  loss,  the  tone  is  perceived  in  the 
affected ear. With a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, the tone 
is  perceived  in  the  unaffected  ear.  A  5-dB  difference  in  hearing 
between the two ears is required for lateralization.

 ■ LABORATORY ASSESSMENT OF HEARING
Audiologic  Assessment  The  minimum  audiologic  assessment 
for  hearing  loss  should  include  the  measurement  of  pure  tone  air- 
conduction and bone-conduction thresholds, speech reception thresh-
old,  word  recognition  score,  tympanometry,  acoustic  reflexes,  and

acoustic-reflex decay. This test battery provides a screening evaluation 
of  the  entire  auditory  system  and  allows  one  to  determine  whether 
further differentiation of a sensory (cochlear) from a neural (retroco-
chlear) hearing loss is indicated.

Pure tone audiometry assesses hearing acuity for pure tones. The test 
is administered by an audiologist and is performed in a sound-attenuated 
chamber.  The  pure  tone  stimulus  is  delivered  with  an  audiometer,  an 
electronic  device  that  allows  the  presentation  of  specific  frequencies 
(generally between 250–8000 Hz) at specific intensities. Air- and bone-
conduction  thresholds  are  established  for  each  ear.  Air-conduction 
thresholds are determined by presenting the stimulus in air with the use 
of headphones. Bone-conduction thresholds are determined by placing 
the stem of a vibrating tuning fork or an oscillator of an audiometer in 
contact with the head. In the presence of a hearing loss, broad-spectrum 
noise  is  presented  to  the  nontest  ear  for  masking  purposes  so  that 
responses are based on perception from the ear under test.

The  responses  are  measured  in  decibels  (dBs).  An  audiogram  is  a 
plot  of  intensity  in  dBs  of  hearing  threshold  versus  frequency.  A  dB 
is equal to 20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the sound pressure 
required  to  achieve  threshold  in  the  patient  to  the  sound  pressure 
required to achieve threshold in a normal-hearing person. Therefore, a 
change of 6 dB represents doubling of sound pressure, and a change of 
20 dB represents a tenfold change in sound pressure. Loudness, which 
depends on the frequency, intensity, and duration of a sound, doubles 
with approximately each 10-dB increase in sound pressure level. Pitch, 
on  the  other  hand,  does  not  directly  correlate  with  frequency.  The

perception of pitch changes slowly in the low and high frequencies. In 
the middle tones, which are important for human speech, pitch varies 
more rapidly with changes in frequency.

Pure  tone  audiometry  establishes  the  presence  and  severity  of 
hearing  impairment,  unilateral  versus  bilateral  involvement,  and  the 
type  of  hearing  loss.  Conductive  hearing  losses  with  a  large  mass 
component, as is often seen in middle-ear effusions, produce elevation 
of thresholds that predominate in the higher frequencies. Conductive 
hearing  losses  with  a  large  stiffness  component,  as  in  fixation  of  the 
footplate  of  the  stapes  in  early  otosclerosis,  produce  threshold  ele-
vations  in  the  lower  frequencies.  Often,  the  conductive  hearing  loss 
involves all frequencies, suggesting involvement of both stiffness and 
mass.  In  general,  sensorineural  hearing  losses  such  as  presbycusis 
affect higher frequencies more than lower frequencies (Fig. 34-3). An 
exception  is  Ménière’s  disease,  which  is  characteristically  associated 
with low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (though any frequency 
can be affected). Noise-induced hearing loss has an unusual pattern of 
hearing impairment in which the loss at 3000–4000 Hz is greater than 
at higher frequencies. Vestibular schwannomas characteristically affect 
the higher frequencies, but any pattern of hearing loss can be observed.
Speech recognition requires greater synchronous neural firing than 
is necessary for appreciation of pure tones. Speech audiometry tests the 
clarity  with  which  one  hears.  The  speech  reception  threshold  (SRT)  is 
defined as the intensity at which speech is recognized as a meaningful 
symbol and is obtained by presenting two-syllable words with an equal 
accent on each syllable. The intensity at which the patient can repeat 
50%  of  the  words  correctly  is  the  SRT.  Once  the  SRT  is  determined, 
discrimination or word recognition ability is tested by presenting one-
syllable words at 25–40 dB above the SRT. The words are phonetically 
balanced  in  that  the  phonemes  (speech  sounds)  occur  in  the  list  of 
words at the same frequency that they occur in ordinary conversational 
English.  An  individual  with  normal  hearing  or  conductive  hearing 
loss can repeat 88–100% of the phonetically balanced words correctly. 
Patients  with  a  sensorineural  hearing  loss  have  variable  loss  of  dis-
crimination. As a general rule, neural lesions produce greater deficits 
in discrimination than do cochlear lesions. For example, in a patient 
with mild asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss, a clue to the diagno-
sis of vestibular schwannoma is the presence of greater than expected 
deterioration in discrimination ability. Deterioration in discrimination 
ability at higher intensities above the SRT also suggests a lesion in the 
eighth nerve or central auditory pathways.

Tympanometry measures the impedance of the middle ear to sound 
and  is  useful  in  diagnosis  of  middle-ear  effusions.  A  tympanogram  is 
the graphic representation of change in impedance or compliance as the 
pressure in the ear canal is changed. Normally, the middle ear is most 
compliant at atmospheric pressure, and the compliance decreases as the 
pressure is increased or decreased (type A); this pattern is seen with nor-
mal hearing or in the presence of sensorineural hearing loss. Compliance 
that does not change with change in pressure suggests middle-ear effu-
sion (type B). With a negative pressure in the middle ear, as with Eusta-
chian  tube  obstruction,  the  point  of  maximal  compliance  occurs  with 
negative pressure in the ear canal (type C). A tympanogram in which no 
point of maximal compliance can be obtained is most commonly seen 
with discontinuity of the ossicular chain (type Ad). A reduction in the 
maximal compliance peak can be seen in otosclerosis (type As).

During  tympanometry,  an  intense  tone  elicits  contraction  of  the 
stapedius muscle. The change in compliance of the middle ear with con-
traction of the stapedius muscle can be detected. The presence or absence 
of this acoustic reflex is important in determining the etiology of hearing 
loss as well as in the anatomic localization of facial nerve paralysis. The 
acoustic  reflex  can  help  differentiate  between  conductive  hearing  loss 
due to otosclerosis and that caused by an inner-ear “third window”: it is 
absent in otosclerosis and present in inner-ear conductive hearing loss. 
Normal or elevated acoustic reflex thresholds in an individual with sen-
sorineural hearing impairment suggest a cochlear hearing loss. An absent 
acoustic reflex in the setting of sensorineural hearing loss is not helpful in 
localizing the site of lesion. Assessment of acoustic reflex decay helps dif-
ferentiate sensory from neural hearing losses. In neural hearing loss, such 
as with vestibular schwannoma, the reflex adapts or decays with time.

OAEs  generated  by  outer  hair  cells  only  can  be  measured  with 
microphones inserted into the external auditory canal. The emissions 
may be spontaneous or evoked with sound stimulation. The presence 
of  OAEs  indicates  that  the  outer  hair  cells  of  the  organ  of  Corti  are 
intact and can be used to assess auditory thresholds and to distinguish 
sensory from neural hearing losses.

Evoked  Responses  Electrocochleography  measures  the  earliest 
evoked  potentials  generated  in  the  cochlea  and  the  auditory  nerve. 
Receptor potentials recorded include the cochlear microphonic, gen-
erated by the outer hair cells of the organ of Corti, and the summating 
potential, generated by the inner hair cells in response to sound. The 
whole nerve action potential representing the composite firing of the 
first-order  neurons  can  also  be  recorded  during  electrocochleogra-
phy. Clinically, the test is useful in the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease, 
in  which  an  elevation  of  the  ratio  of  summating  potential  to  action 
potential is seen.

Brainstem auditory-evoked responses (BAERs), also known as ABRs, 
are  useful  in  differentiating  the  site  of  sensorineural  hearing  loss.  In 
response to sound, five distinct electrical potentials arising from differ-
ent stations along the peripheral and central auditory pathway (eighth 
nerve,  cochlear  nucleus,  superior  olivary  complex,  lateral  lemniscus, 
and  inferior  colliculus)  can  be  identified  using  computer  averaging 
from  scalp  surface  electrodes.  BAERs  are  valuable  in  situations  in 
which  patients  cannot  or  will  not  give  reliable  voluntary  thresholds. 
They  are  also  used  to  assess  the  integrity  of  the  auditory  nerve  and 
brainstem in various clinical situations, including intraoperative mon-
itoring, and in determination of brain death.

The VEMP test investigates otolith and vestibular nerve function by 
presenting a high-level acoustic stimulus and evoking a short-latency 
electromyographic potential; cVEMP (or cervical VEMP) and oVEMP 
(or ocular VEMP) have been described. The cVEMP elicits a vestib-
ulocollic  reflex  whose  afferent  limb  arises  from  acoustically  sensitive 
cells in the saccule, with signals conducted via the inferior vestibular 
nerve.  cVEMP  is  a  biphasic,  short-latency  response  recorded  from 
the  tonically  contracted  sternocleidomastoid  muscle  in  response  to 
loud  auditory  clicks  or  tones.  cVEMPs  may  be  diminished  or  absent 
in  patients  with  early  and  late  Ménière’s  disease,  vestibular  neuritis, 
benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and vestibular schwannoma. On 
the other hand, the threshold for VEMPs may be lower in cases of supe-
rior canal dehiscence, other inner-ear dehiscence (“third window”), and 
perilymphatic fistula. The oVEMP, in contrast, is a response involving 
the utricle primarily and superior vestibular nerve. The oVEMP exci-
tatory response is recorded from the extraocular muscle. The oVEMP 
is abnormal in superior vestibular neuritis.

Imaging  Studies  The  choice  of  radiologic  tests  is  largely  deter-
mined by whether the goal is to evaluate the bony anatomy of the exter-
nal, middle, and inner ear or to image the auditory nerve and brain. 
Axial and coronal CT of the temporal bone with fine 0.3-mm cuts is 
ideal for determining the caliber of the external auditory canal, integ-
rity of the ossicular chain, and presence of middle-ear or mastoid dis-
ease; it can also detect inner-ear malformations. CT is also ideal for the 
detection of bone erosion with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. 
Pöschl reformatting in the plane of the superior semicircular canal is 
required for the identification of dehiscence or absence of bone over 
the superior semicircular canal. MRI is superior to CT for imaging of 
retrocochlear pathology such as vestibular schwannoma, meningioma, 
other lesions of the cerebellopontine angle, demyelinating lesions of the 
brainstem, and brain tumors. Both CT and MRI are equally capable of 
identifying inner-ear malformations and assessing cochlear patency for 
preoperative evaluation of patients for cochlear implantation.

TREATMENT
Disorders of the Sense of Hearing

In  general,  conductive  hearing  losses  are  amenable  to  surgical 
correction, whereas sensorineural hearing losses are usually man-
aged medically. Atresia of the ear canal can be surgically repaired, 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   245

often  with  significant  improvement  in  hearing.  Alternatively,  the 
conductive  hearing  loss  associated  with  atresia  can  be  addressed 
with a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA). Tympanic membrane 
perforations due to chronic otitis media or trauma can be repaired 
with  an  outpatient  tympanoplasty.  Likewise,  conductive  hearing 
loss  associated  with  otosclerosis  can  be  treated  by  stapedectomy, 
which  is  successful  in  >95%  of  cases.  Tympanostomy  tubes  allow 
the prompt return of normal hearing in individuals with middle-ear 
effusions. Hearing aids are effective and well tolerated in patients 
with conductive hearing losses.

Patients  with  mild,  moderate,  and  severe  sensorineural  hearing 
losses are regularly rehabilitated with hearing aids of varying config-
uration  and  strength.  Hearing  aids  have  been  improved  to  provide 
greater fidelity and have been miniaturized. The current generation 
of  hearing  aids  is  nearly  invisible,  thus  reducing  stigma  associated 
with their use. In general, the more severe the hearing impairment, 
the larger the hearing aid required for auditory rehabilitation. Digital 
hearing  aids  lend  themselves  to  individual  programming,  and  mul-
tiple and directional microphones at the ear level may be helpful in 
noisy surroundings. Because all hearing aids amplify noise as well as 
speech, the only absolute solution to the problem of noise is to place 
the  microphone  closer  to  the  speaker  than  the  noise  source.  This 
arrangement is not possible with a self-contained, cosmetically accept-
able device. A significant limitation of rehabilitation with a hearing aid 
is that although it is able to enhance detection of sound with amplifi-
cation, it cannot restore clarity of hearing that is lost with presbycusis.
The  cost  of  a  single  hearing  aid  (~$2300  US)  is  a  significant 
obstacle for many hearing-impaired individuals and usually bilat-
eral amplification is recommended. To reduce cost and spur inno-
vation,  a  new  category  of  over-the-counter  amplification  devices 
that  can  be  purchased  similar  to  reading  eyeglasses  by  simply 
walking into a store has recently been approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration. By reducing the cost of amplification devices 
to consumers, promoting innovation, and increasing competition, 
this new class of devices could fundamentally change the way hear-
ing rehabilitation is delivered.

Patients with unilateral deafness have difficulty with sound local-
ization  and  reduced  clarity  of  hearing  in  background  noise.  They 
may benefit from a contralateral routing of signal (CROS) hearing 
aid in which a microphone is placed on the hearing-impaired side, 
and the sound is transmitted to the receiver placed on the contralat-
eral ear. The same result may be obtained with a BAHA, in which 
a hearing aid clamps to a screw integrated into the skull on the 
hearing-impaired  side.  Like  the  CROS  hearing  aid,  the  BAHA 
transfers the acoustic signal to the contralateral hearing ear, but it 
does so by vibrating the skull. Patients with profound deafness on 
one side and some hearing loss in the better ear are candidates for 
a BICROS hearing aid; it differs from the CROS hearing aid in that 
the  patient  wears  a  hearing  aid,  and  not  simply  a  receiver,  in  the 
better ear. Unfortunately, while CROS and BAHA devices provide 
benefit, they do not restore hearing in the deaf ear. Only cochlear 
implants  can  restore  hearing  (see  below).  Increasingly,  cochlear 
implants are being used for the treatment of patients with single-
sided deafness; they show great promise in not only restoring hear-
ing  and  reducing  tinnitus,  but  also  improving  sound  localization 
and performance in background noise.

In  many  situations,  including  lectures  and  the  theater,  hearing- 
impaired persons benefit from assistive devices that are based on the 
principle  of  having  the  speaker  closer  to  the  microphone  than  any 
source of noise. Assistive devices include infrared and frequency-mod-
ulated (FM) transmission as well as an electromagnetic loop around 
the  room  for  transmission  to  the  individual’s  hearing  aid.  Hearing 
aids with telecoils can also be used with properly equipped telephones 
in  the  same  way.  Bluetooth  technology  has  revolutionized  connec-
tivity between hearing aids and other devices such as smart phones.
In  the  event  that  the  hearing  aid  provides  inadequate  rehabili-
tation, cochlear implants may be appropriate  (Fig. 34-4). Criteria 
for  implantation  include  severe  to  profound  hearing  loss  with 
open-set sentence cognition of ≤40% under best-aided conditions.

FIGURE  34-4  A  cochlear  implant  is  composed  of  an  external  microphone  and 
speech  processor  worn  on  the  ear  and  a  receiver  implanted  underneath  the 
temporalis muscle. The internal receiver is attached to an electrode that is placed 
surgically in the cochlea.

Worldwide,  >600,000  hearing-impaired  individuals  have  received 
cochlear  implants.  Cochlear  implants  are  neural  prostheses  that 
convert sound energy to electrical energy and can be used to stim-
ulate  the  auditory  division  of  the  eighth  nerve  directly.  In  most 
cases  of  profound  hearing  impairment,  the  auditory  hair  cells  are 
lost but the ganglionic cells of the auditory division of the eighth 
nerve are preserved. Cochlear implants consist of electrodes that are 
inserted into the cochlea through the round window, speech pro-
cessors  that  extract  acoustic  elements  of  speech  for  conversion  to 
electrical currents, and a means of transmitting the electrical energy 
through  the  skin.  Patients  with  implants  experience  sound  that 
helps with speech reading, allows open-set word recognition, and 
helps in modulating the person’s own voice. Usually, within the first  
3–6  months  after  implantation,  adult  patients  can  understand 
speech  without  visual  cues.  With  the  current  generation  of  mul-
tichannel  cochlear  implants,  nearly  75%  of  patients  are  able  to 
converse  on  the  telephone.  Bilateral  cochlear  implantations  are 
commonly  performed,  especially  in  children;  these  patients  per-
form  better  in  background  noise,  have  better  sound  localization, 
and are less fatigued by the “work” compared to monaural hearing.
Hybrid  cochlear  implants  are  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
high-frequency hearing loss in patients who do not have profound 
hearing loss and yet do not benefit from hearing aids. Patients with 
presbycusis  typically  have  normal  low-frequency  hearing  while 
suffering from high-frequency hearing loss associated with loss of 
clarity that cannot always be adequately rehabilitated with a hearing 
aid.  However,  these  patients  are  not  candidates  for  conventional 
cochlear  implants  because  they  have  too  much  residual  hearing. 
The hybrid implant has been specifically designed for this patient 
population; it has a shorter electrode than a conventional cochlear 
implant  and  can  be  introduced  into  the  cochlea  atraumatically, 
thus  preserving  low-frequency  hearing.  Individuals  with  a  hybrid 
implant use their own natural low-frequency “acoustic” hearing and

ing. Patients who have received the hybrid implant perform better 
on speech discrimination tests in both quiet and noisy backgrounds.
For individuals who were born without cochlea or have had both 
eighth nerves destroyed by trauma or bilateral vestibular schwanno-
mas (e.g., neurofibromatosis type 2), brainstem auditory implants 
placed near the cochlear nucleus may provide auditory rehabilita-
tion.  Currently,  brainstem  implants  provide  sound  awareness  but 
unfortunately speech understanding remains elusive.

Tinnitus often accompanies hearing loss. Similar to background 
noise,  tinnitus  can  degrade  speech  comprehension  in  individuals 
with hearing impairment. Patients with tinnitus should be advised 
to minimize caffeine ingestion, avoid high dosage of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and reduce stress. Therapy for 
tinnitus is usually directed toward minimizing the appreciation of 
tinnitus. Relief of the tinnitus may be obtained by masking it with 
background music or white noise. Hearing aids are also helpful in 
tinnitus suppression, as are tinnitus maskers, devices that present a 
sound to the affected ear that is more pleasant to listen to than the 
tinnitus. The use of a tinnitus masker is often followed by several 
hours of inhibition of the tinnitus. Antidepressants have also been 
shown to be beneficial in helping patients cope with tinnitus.

Hard-of-hearing  individuals  often  benefit  from  a  reduction  in 
unnecessary noise in the environment (e.g., radio or television) to 
enhance  the  signal-to-noise  ratio.  Speech  comprehension  is  aided 
by  lip  reading;  therefore,  the  impaired  listener  should  be  seated 
so that the face of the speaker is well illuminated and easily seen. 
Although  speech  should  be  in  a  loud,  clear  voice,  one  should  be 
aware that in sensorineural hearing losses in general and in hard-
of-hearing elderly in particular, recruitment (abnormal perception 
of loud sounds) may be troublesome. Above all, optimal communi-
cation cannot take place without both parties giving it their full and 
undivided attention.

 ■ PREVENTION
Conductive  hearing  losses  may  be  prevented  by  prompt  antibiotic 
therapy  of  adequate  duration  for  AOM  and  by  ventilation  of  the 
middle  ear  with  tympanostomy  tubes  in  middle-ear  effusions  lasting  
≥12 weeks. Loss of vestibular function and deafness due to aminogly-
coside  antibiotics  can  largely  be  prevented  by  careful  monitoring  of 
serum peak and trough levels.

Some  10  million  Americans  have  noise-induced  hearing  loss,  and 
20 million are exposed to hazardous noise in their employment. Noise- 
induced hearing loss can be prevented by avoidance of exposure to loud 
noise or by regular use of earplugs or fluid-filled ear muffs to attenuate 
intense  sound.  Table  34-4  lists  loudness  levels  for  a  variety  of  envi-
ronmental sounds. High-risk activities for noise-induced hearing loss 
include use of electrical equipment for wood- and metalworking, and 
target practice or hunting with small firearms. All internal-combustion

and  electric  engines,  including  snow  and  leaf  blowers,  snowmobiles, 
outboard  motors,  and  chainsaws,  require  protection  of  the  user  with 
hearing protectors. Virtually all noise-induced hearing loss is prevent-
able through education, which should begin before the teenage years. 
Programs for conservation of hearing in the workplace are required by 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) whenever 
the exposure over an 8-h period averages 85 dB. OSHA mandates that 
workers  in  such  noisy  environments  have  hearing  monitoring  and 
protection programs that include a preemployment screen, an annual 
audiologic  assessment,  and  the  mandatory  use  of  hearing  protectors. 
Exposure  to  loud  sounds  above  85  dB  in  the  work  environment  is 
restricted  by  OSHA,  with  halving  of  allowed  exposure  time  for  each 
increment of 5 dB above this threshold; for example, exposure to 90 dB 
is permitted for 8 h; 95 dB for 4 h, and 100 dB for 2 h (Table 34-5).

35 Upper Respiratory  

Symptoms, Including  
Earache, Sinus Symptoms,  
and Sore Throat
Rachel L. Amdur, Jeffrey A. Linder

Upper  respiratory  symptoms  are  most  commonly  caused  by  viral 
infection  but  also  can  be  caused  by  other  infectious,  inflammatory, 
allergic, autoimmune, and neoplastic conditions. This chapter will dis-
cuss ambulatory antibiotic prescribing and review the most common 
causes  of  upper  respiratory  symptoms,  including  nonspecific  upper 
respiratory infections.

Ear  pain  is  most  commonly  caused  by  otitis  externa,  acute  otitis 
media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and acute mastoid-
itis. Sinus symptoms can be caused by acute sinusitis, invasive fungal 
sinusitis,  nosocomial  sinusitis,  and  chronic  sinusitis.  Sore  throat  and 
neck pain can be caused by streptococcal pharyngitis, nonstreptococcal 
pharyngitis,  acute  infectious  mononucleosis,  other  types  of  bacterial 
pharyngitis, Lemierre’s syndrome, gonococcal pharyngitis, diphtheria, 
acute HIV infection, head and neck abscesses, epiglottitis, and laryn-
gitis. At the time of presentation, upper respiratory symptoms of most 
common viral and bacterial etiologies have generally lasted from hours 
up to a few days.

UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS
Upper  respiratory  infections  (URIs)  are  acute  respiratory  infections 
that  occur  above  the  vocal  cords.  URIs,  including  nonspecific  upper 
respiratory tract infection, otitis media, sinusitis, and pharyngitis, are 
collectively  the  most  common  symptomatic  reason  for  seeking  care 
in the United States. In terms of etiology, symptoms, and signs, URIs 
overlap  with  lower  acute  respiratory  infections  that  occur  below  the 
vocal cords, such as influenza (Chap. 200), acute bronchitis, and pneu-
monia (Chap. 126), as well as with noninfectious cough (Chap. 38).  
The average adult has 2–4 URIs per year; children can have 6–10 URIs 
annually. URIs can be prevented by hand washing or sanitization, phys-
ical distancing, use of facial masks, isolation of persons who are ill, and 
environmental cleaning (Chap. 199).

SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19, can cause vir-
tually any upper respiratory symptom (Chap. 199). COVID-19 symp-
toms  appear  2–14  days  after  exposure  and  may  include  fever,  chills, 
cough,  shortness  of  breath,  fatigue,  myalgias,  headaches,  rhinorrhea, 
sore throat, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. New loss of taste or smell 
appears to be specific for COVID-19. Until there is widespread natural 
or vaccine-induced immunity, any respiratory symptom occurring in 
areas where SARS-CoV-2 is circulating should be considered a poten-
tial manifestation of COVID-19.

 ■ IMPROVING AMBULATORY ANTIBIOTIC 
PRESCRIBING
The only common acute respiratory infections that should be treated 
with  antibiotics  are  AOM,  sinusitis,  streptococcal  pharyngitis,  and 
pneumonia. Even for AOM, sinusitis, and pharyngitis, only a minority 
of cases meet the criteria for antibiotic prescribing. Common respiratory 
viruses (Chap. 199) cause the overwhelming majority of acute respira-
tory infections, and these infections are generally self-limited; antibiot-
ics neither speed resolution nor prevent complications for the majority 
of acute respiratory infections. Unfortunately, for this reason, at least 
half of ambulatory antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory infec-
tions in the United States are inappropriate. Internationally, population 
rates of antibiotic prescribing vary nearly threefold, with no differences 
in infectious complications. Antibiotics cause adverse drug effects, alter 
the  microbiome,  cause  Clostridioides  difficile  infection  (Chap.  134), 
increase  health  care  costs,  and  increase  the  prevalence  of  antibiotic- 
resistant bacteria (Chap. 145).

Clinicians prescribe inappropriate antibiotics because of time pres-
sure; fear of missing a rare bacterial diagnosis; concern about prevent-
ing a rare bacterial complication; a lack of salience of adverse antibiotic 
effects; or a mistaken belief that most patients expect, demand, or will 
not be satisfied without an antibiotic prescription.

 ■ AMBULATORY ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP
Antibiotic  stewardship  has  traditionally  been  an  inpatient  concern 
(Chap. 144), but ambulatory antibiotic use accounts for ~85% of anti-
biotic use by patients in most developed countries. In 2016, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention published the “Core Elements of Out-
patient  Antibiotic  Stewardship.”  The  core  elements  include  (1)  com-
mitting to improving antibiotic prescribing; (2) implementing at least 
one policy or practice to improve antibiotic prescribing and assessing 
its  effectiveness;  (3)  monitoring  antibiotic  prescribing  and  providing 
feedback;  and  (4)  providing  educational  resources  to  clinicians  and 

patients  on  antibiotic  prescribing.  Effective  interventions  to  decrease 
inappropriate  ambulatory  antibiotic  prescribing  include  peer  com-
parison,  accountable  justification,  precommitment,  clinical  decision 
support, patient education, and multifaceted interventions. Communi-
cation training has been particularly effective when it includes making 
a clear diagnosis, focusing on positive actions patients can take to feel 
better, reviewing the expected course of illness, and informing patients 
about concerning symptoms (red flags) for which they should seek or 
reconnect  with  care.  Telemedicine—synchronous  telephone  or  video 
or  asynchronous  electronic  messaging—has  the  potential  to  improve 
patient convenience and reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.

Several  techniques  that  seemed  promising  for  the  reduction  of 
ambulatory  antibiotic  prescribing  remain  unproven,  have  been  inef-
fective (e.g., procalcitonin testing), or are not durable (e.g., C-reactive 
protein testing). The practice of delayed antibiotic prescription—i.e., a 
prescription given to a patient who is asked not to fill it unless symp-
toms do not improve in a few days—is conceptually flawed and should 
be  avoided.  Delayed  antibiotic  prescriptions  are  usually  given  for  
antibiotic-inappropriate  diagnoses  (e.g.,  viral  infections);  they  ignore 
the  natural  history  of  acute  respiratory  infections,  which  are 
self-limited and generally last from 5 to 14 days; they put the burden 
of  clinical  decision-making  on  patients;  and  they  send  a  confusing, 
mixed message to patients about the appropriateness of antibiotics for 
respiratory infections.

NONSPECIFIC UPPER RESPIRATORY 
INFECTION (“THE COMMON COLD”)
 ■ DEFINITION AND ETIOLOGY
Nonspecific URI, or the common cold, is a respiratory tract infection 
in which no single symptom predominates. Nonspecific URI is most 
commonly  caused  by  respiratory  viruses  that  are  acquired  through 
direct  contact  with  infected  individuals,  contaminated  surfaces,  and 
large and small respiratory droplets. The most common viral causes of 
nonspecific URIs are rhinoviruses (well over 100 serotypes; Chap. 199),  
coronaviruses,  parainfluenza  virus,  respiratory  syncytial  virus,  influ-
enza virus (Chap. 199), adenovirus (57 serotypes; Chap. 199), metap-
neumovirus,  and  bocavirus  (Chap.  199).  Making  a  specific  viral 
diagnosis is not practical, cost-effective, or necessary. Multiplex panels 
of  reverse  transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction  are  available  but 
may be overly sensitive, as prior recent infection can cause false-positive 
results. Although the diagnosis is usually obvious, clinicians diagnos-
ing  a  nonspecific  URI  should  also  consider  influenza  (Chap.  200), 
measles  (cough,  coryza,  and  conjunctivitis;  Chap.  205),  acute  HIV 
infection (in which sore throat and rash often predominate; see below 
and Chap. 202), and COVID-19 (Chap. 199).

Individual  susceptibility  to  nonspecific  URIs  depends  on  prior 
exposure, immunity, general health, genetics, microbiome-related fac-
tors, and mental health and social factors, including stress. Prior expo-
sure leads to immunity to specific rhinoviruses and adenoviruses, but 
the  number  of  serotypes  makes  reinfection  likely.  Immunity  to  non-
COVID-19  coronaviruses,  parainfluenza  virus,  respiratory  syncytial 
virus, and metapneumoviruses is generally weak or of short duration.
 ■ SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS
Common  respiratory  viruses  have  incubation  periods  of  2–8  days 
after exposure. Symptoms generally begin gradually and include nasal 
fullness or obstruction, rhinorrhea, sore throat, laryngitis, lymphade-
nopathy, cough, and low-grade fever. Patients may have myalgias, but 
this feature usually is not as prominent as it is in influenza. Epistaxis is 
common with frequent nose blowing.

On physical examination, findings vary, but patients may have con-
junctivitis, pharyngeal erythema, pharyngeal exudates, or pharyngeal 
cobblestoning.  Depending  on  the  phase  of  illness,  the  nasal  mucosa 
may be pale, boggy, or red and swollen. Nasal mucus can range from 
watery  to  purulent.  On  auscultation,  the  lungs  may  be  clear,  or  the 
patient may have diffuse wheezing or bronchial breath sounds consis-
tent with a viral infection. Symptoms usually last 5–10 days but often 
last up to 14 days.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesTREATMENT
Nonspecific Upper Respiratory Infection

For  adults  and  older  children,  treatment  of  nonspecific  URI  is 
symptom-based.  Fever,  myalgias,  and  sore  throat  can  be  treated 
with  acetaminophen  or  a  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug 
(NSAID) such as ibuprofen. Rhinorrhea can be treated with ipratro-
pium bromide. Nasal congestion can be managed with nasal decon-
gestants such as oxymetazoline (two sprays into each nostril twice 
a day for up to 5 days) or systemic decongestants such as pseudo-
ephedrine. Products that combine a decongestant with analgesics, 
antihistamines, or both help relieve symptoms. Although support-
ing data are weak, cough may be relieved with dextromethorphan 
or benzonatate (Tessalon Perles). Opioids, while effective at reliev-
ing cough, are associated with somnolence, dysphoria, constipation, 
and addiction.

For  children  <6  years  old,  cough  and  cold  medicines  should 
not  be  prescribed,  recommended,  or  used  because  of  the  risks  of 
adverse effects. Honey can help soothe a sore throat for children >1 
year old. Cool-mist humidifiers may help with breathing, and saline 
nasal drops and bulb suctioning can help with nasal congestion.

Patients  need  to  be  informed  that  symptoms  generally  peak 
early but can last for up to 14 days; that they are infectious as long 
as they have symptoms; and that they should rest and drink plenty 
of fluids to avoid dehydration. Red flags for which patients should 
seek care include a fever of >102°F, chest pain (other than from a 
pulled muscle), shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, new ear or 
sinus pain, and symptoms lasting >14 days. Although nonspecific 
URI can be complicated by otitis media and bacterial sinusitis, for 
an individual patient, an antibiotic is more likely to cause an adverse 
reaction than to prevent complications.

Other  remedies  that  are  ineffective,  of  questionable  benefit, 
or  associated  with  significant  adverse  effects  include  echinacea, 
zinc,  inhaled  steam,  vitamin  C,  vitamin  D,  garlic,  antihistamines, 
Chinese  medicinal  herbs,  intranasal  glucocorticoids,  Pelargo-
nium  sidoides  herbal  extract,  saline  nasal  irrigation,  and  antiviral   
drugs.

EAR PAIN
Ear pain is most commonly caused by otitis externa and otitis media. 
In  adults,  otologic  disease  is  almost  always  associated  with  hearing 
changes. At >50 years of age, temporal arteritis should be considered 
in  patients  who  have  headache,  malaise,  weight  loss,  fever,  anorexia, 
and a normal ear exam. Head and neck cancers should be considered 
in persons with a history of smoking and alcohol use. In children, the 
presence of a foreign body should be considered.

Ear pain can also result from other causes of local infection, inflam-
mation, trauma, or tumors or can be referred. Innervation of the ear 
and surrounding areas includes cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X and 
cervical  nerves  C2  and  C3.  Neuropathic  and  myopathic  pain  syn-
dromes (e.g., trigeminal neuralgia) can cause ear pain. Ramsay Hunt 
syndrome (herpes zoster oticus) (Chap. 441) and Bell’s palsy (Chap. 441) 
are both associated with ear pain.

Dental pathology can cause pain that radiates to the ear; caries and 
abscesses  are  most  common.  Bruxism,  malocclusion,  and  temporo-
mandibular  disorder  may  be  associated  with  tenderness  in  muscular 
attachments and the temporomandibular joint. Salivary gland pathol-
ogy and cervical adenopathy can cause pain that radiates to the ear.

Sinusitis, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis cause pain that can radiate to the 
ear via cranial nerve IX. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Chap. 321) 
is often associated with ear symptoms. Myocardial infarction can cause 
ear pain via cranial nerve X.

Relapsing polychondritis (Chap. 366) is a rare condition associated 
with recurrent, sometimes bilateral, erythematous, or violaceous swell-
ing of the auricle (sparing the earlobe). Inflammation from relapsing 
polychondritis can involve nasal septal, laryngeal, or respiratory carti-
lage and can cause ocular inflammation, audiovestibular damage, and 
nonerosive seronegative inflammatory arthritis.

 ■ OTITIS EXTERNA
Etiology  and  Clinical  Manifestations  Otitis  externa  is  an 
inflammation  or  infection  of  the  external  auditory  canal  manifesting 
as pain, redness, swelling, aural discharge, and hearing impairment. It 
is often associated with bacterial infection (frequently by Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa  or  Staphylococcus  aureus),  but  fungi  like  Aspergillus  or  
Candida can be implicated.

Otitis externa is most common among preteen and teenage children. 
Risk  factors  for  otitis  externa  include  swimming  (with  the  resulting 
condition  referred  to  as  “swimmer’s  ear,”  which  is  more  common 
in  the  summer),  mechanical  trauma  (from  cotton  swabs  or  hearing 
aids), narrow ear canals, cerumen obstruction, eczema, and psoriasis. 
Classic  swimmer’s  ear  is  associated  with  bacterial  infection.  Physical 
exam is notable for pain on movement of the auricle or tragus and an 
external auditory canal that is erythematous, edematous, inflamed, and 
sometimes coated with exudate on otoscopy. In contrast, fungal otitis 
externa  often  manifests  with  pruritus  and  ear  discharge  but  without 
much pain.

Otitis externa can co-occur with otitis media. Preauricular, mastoid, 
parotid,  or  cervical  lymphadenopathy  may  be  present.  AOM  with 
tympanic  membrane  rupture  (see  below)  can  be  associated  with  ear 
discharge and debris in the ear canal but (unlike otitis externa) without 
sensitivity to movement of the auricle.

Malignant Otitis Externa  Malignant otitis externa is a poten-
tially  life-threatening  form  of  otitis  externa  that  involves  the  tem-
poral  bone  and  occurs  in  patients  with  diabetes  or  other  types  of 
immunosuppression, often in older adults. Patients may have fever. 
Progression of malignant otitis externa can affect cranial nerve VII, 
IX, XI, or XII.

TREATMENT
Otitis Externa

Analgesia should be provided with acetaminophen or an NSAID. 
The mainstay of treatment is one or more topical antibacterial drugs 
with  a  glucocorticoid  for  7–10  days.  Polymyxin  B–neomycin– 
hydrocortisone  is  often  used  but  should  be  avoided  in  patients 
with  tympanic  membrane  perforation  because  of  ototoxicity. 
Ciprofloxacin–hydrocortisone is an alternative.

Topical  aluminum  acetate  may  be  as  effective  as  a  topical   
antibacterial–glucocorticoid regimen. For patients whose condition 
does not improve within 2–4 days with topical treatment, ear wicks 
or gauze impregnated with or soaked in anti-infective agents can be 
placed.  Ineffective  treatments  include  oral  antibiotics  and  topical 
antifungals.  Otitis  externa  frequently  recurs;  its  recurrence  may 
be prevented with periodic acetic acid or aluminum acetate drops.
For  malignant  otitis  externa,  oral  antipseudomonal  antibiotics 
are often prescribed. Patients sometimes require IV pain medica-
tion, fluids, or other antimicrobials.

 ■ ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA
Epidemiology  and  Etiology  AOM—for  which  patients  almost 
always  present  within  days—is  predominantly  a  disease  of  children, 
with incidence peaking at 6–24 months of age. By age 6, ~60% of chil-
dren will have had an episode of AOM. Younger children appear to be 
susceptible because of a shorter, more horizontal eustachian tube that 
more easily accumulates fluid than it does in older children and adults 
and because their immune system is still developing.

AOM is caused by a viral URI leading to edema and inflammation of 
the nasopharynx and eustachian tube, collection of fluid, and infection 
by  bacteria  that  colonize  the  nasopharynx.  Viruses  isolated  include 
respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses, 
influenza  virus,  adenoviruses,  and  human  metapneumovirus.  The 
bacteria most commonly isolated are Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-
typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

250 Symptoms and Signs  Symptoms of AOM include ear pain, fever, 
irritability, otorrhea, and anorexia. Physical examination may be nota-
ble for a bulging, inflamed, cloudy tympanic membrane, with obscured 
landmarks, and immobility of the membrane on pneumatoscopy, the 
Valsalva  maneuver,  or  swallowing  while  holding  the  nose  shut.  (An 
immobile  tympanic  membrane  is  also  indicative  of  perforation,  old 
middle-ear  adhesions,  a  blocked  auditory  tube,  or  the  presence  of 
middle-ear fluid.) Patients have conductive hearing loss. Severe signs 
and  symptoms  include  moderate  to  severe  otalgia,  otalgia  lasting  at 
least 2 days, and a temperature of >102.2°F.

AOM  should  be  diagnosed  in  children  with  moderate  to  severe 
bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea (not due to 
otitis externa). With mild bulging of the tympanic membrane, AOM 
can also be diagnosed if the patient has had symptoms for <48 h or if 
there is intense erythema of the tympanic membrane. AOM should not 
be diagnosed in children who do not have middle-ear effusion.

for 3 days. If, despite a change in antibiotics, the patient’s condition 
still does not improve, that patient should be referred to a specialist. 
Middle-ear effusions are present in 60–70% of children with AOM; 
these should resolve over 3 months. Tympanostomy tubes should be 
considered for recurrent AOM (i.e., three episodes in 6 months or 
four episodes in 1 year). Mastoiditis is a rare complication of AOM 
that is suggested by postauricular tenderness, a postauricular mass, 
or protrusion of the ear lobe.

In adults, AOM is rare and there is little high-quality evidence 
to guide treatment. For adults, it remains important to differentiate 
AOM  from  OME,  but  AOM  is  generally  treated  with  antibiotics, 
regardless  of  bilaterality  or  otorrhea.  Amoxicillin  is  the  drug  of 
choice. Adults should also be treated with decongestants and anal-
gesics. Adults with more than two episodes in a year or persistent 
effusion should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

TREATMENT
Acute Otitis Media

Pain from AOM should be treated with NSAIDs or acetaminophen, 
which are effective for mild to moderate pain. Topical agents like 
benzocaine,  procaine,  or  lidocaine  may  provide  some  additional, 
brief benefit beyond that offered by NSAIDs or acetaminophen.

In  up  to  80%  of  children,  AOM  resolves  without  antibiotics. 
Indications  for  antibiotic  treatment  in  children  include  an  age  of 
<6  months,  bilateral  ear  findings  in  children  6  months  to  2  years 
old,  otorrhea  in  children  >6  months  old,  and—in  children  of  all 
ages—ear findings with severe otalgia, ear pain for >48 h, or a fever 
of >102.2°F (Table 35-1).

The benefits of antibiotics are modest and are offset by adverse 
effects. Antibiotics do not result in early resolution of pain but do 
decrease  pain  by  day  2  or  3  (number  needed  to  treat,  20  patients 
treated  with  antibiotics  for  1  patient  to  have  decreased  pain  by 
day 2 or 3). More children who receive antibiotics have vomiting, 
diarrhea,  and  rash  (number  needed  to  harm,  14  patients  treated 
with  antibiotics  for  1  to  have  vomiting,  diarrhea,  or  rash).  Severe 
complications like mastoiditis are rare, and the number needed to 
treat to prevent a case of mastoiditis is ~5000 (i.e., 5000 otitis media 
patients  treated  with  antibiotics  to  prevent  1  case  of  mastoiditis). 
The  American  Academy  of  Family  Physicians  recommends  not 
routinely prescribing antibiotics for otitis media in children 2–12 years 
old who have nonsevere symptoms and for whom the observation 
option is reasonable.

The  antibiotic  of  choice  for  AOM  is  high-dose  amoxicillin   

(90  mg/kg  per  d,  up  to  3  g).  Alternatives  include  cefdinir,  cefu-
roxime, cefpodoxime, or IM ceftriaxone. If the patient has received 
amoxicillin  in  the  prior  30  days,  clinicians  should  prescribe   
amoxicillin/clavulanate (90/6.4 mg/kg per d) in two divided doses. 
The duration of antibiotic treatment is 10 days for children <2 years 
old  or  children  with  severe  symptoms;  5–7  days  for  children   
2–5 years old with mild to moderate AOM; and 5 days for children 
≥6 years old with mild or moderate symptoms.

If a patient’s condition is not better after 48–72 h of treatment, the 
antibiotic regimen should be changed to amoxicillin/clavulanate, a 
second- or third-generation oral cephalosporin, or IM ceftriaxone

 ■ OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION
Definition  and  Etiology  OME,  also  called  serous  otitis  media, 
occurs  when  there  is  fluid  in  the  middle  ear  but  no  acute  infection. 
Most patients with OME are young children; >60% of cases occur in 
children <2 years old. Many children have recurrent episodes.

OME is most often a sequela of a viral infection causing AOM, but 
it can also be caused by allergies. In addition to allergies, predisposing 
factors include craniofacial abnormalities, gastroesophageal reflux, and 
enlarged adenoids.

Symptoms and Signs  The most common symptoms are decreases 
in  sound  conduction  and  hearing.  Children  with  OME  may  exhibit 
impaired language development or communication difficulties. More 
rarely,  patients  complain  of  intermittent  ear  fullness  or  earache,  tin-
nitus, or balance problems. On examination, the tympanic membrane 
may be translucent or gray with fluid (often colorless or amber), air-
fluid levels, or bubbles behind the membrane. There is a loss of the light 
reflex. The tympanic membrane has decreased mobility on pneumatic 
otoscopy. The evaluation may include audiometry, tympanometry, and, 
in infants, measurement of auditory brainstem responses.

OME usually resolves spontaneously within 4–6 weeks. If it persists 
for >3 months, the condition is referred to as chronic OME or chronic 
serous otitis media.

Cholesteatomas  are  accumulations  of  epithelium  or  keratin  in 
the  middle  ear  that  can  enlarge,  perforate  the  tympanic  membrane, 
envelop the ossicles, or destroy surrounding tissue. Cholesteatomas can 
cause labyrinthitis, hearing loss, cranial nerve palsies, vertigo, menin-
gitis, extradural or brain abscess, and lateral sinus thrombophlebitis.

TREATMENT
Otitis Media with Effusion

OME is treated with myringotomy with tympanostomy tube inser-
tion. For young children with nasal obstruction or recurrent infec-
tion,  adenoidectomy  may  be  considered.  Medications,  including 
antihistamines, glucocorticoids, or antibiotics, do not reliably help. 
Children at risk for speech or language delay may need earlier refer-
ral for more aggressive treatment.

 ■ ACUTE MASTOIDITIS
Etiology  Acute  mastoiditis  is  a  serious  infection  with  significant 
morbidity despite antibiotic and surgical treatment. This condition is 
most common among children <2 years old but can occur at any age. 
Acute  mastoiditis  is  often  a  complication  of  AOM  but  may  develop 
without clinically apparent, prior AOM. In older children with acute 
mastoiditis, clinicians should suspect cholesteatoma.

The pathogenesis of mastoiditis involves spread of organisms from 
the  middle-ear  spaces  through  the  aditus  ad  antrum  to  the  mastoid 
air cells. Incipient mastoiditis consists of fluid within the mastoid air

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasescells, without bony destruction of the bony septa, and can progress to 
coalescent mastoiditis, with destruction of the bony septa. Acute mas-
toiditis often causes subperiosteal abscess laterally. The organisms most 
commonly  involved  in  mastoiditis  are  S.  pneumoniae,  Streptococcus 
pyogenes, H. influenzae, S. aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus 
[MRSA] strains), and P. aeruginosa.

Symptoms  and  Signs  Symptoms  of  acute  mastoiditis  include 
ear pain, fever, lethargy, or fussiness despite adequate treatment of 
AOM.  Patients—especially  those  with  subperiosteal  abscess—may 
have  postauricular  erythema,  tenderness,  warmth,  fluctuance,  and 
protrusion of the auricle. Otoscopic examination most often yields 
findings  of  AOM  and  may  show  superoposterior  protrusion  of 
the  external  auditory  canal.  Complications  of  mastoiditis  include 
facial  nerve  palsy,  labyrinthitis,  skull  osteomyelitis,  temporal  lobe 
abscess,  cerebellar  abscess,  meningitis,  epidural  abscess,  subdural 
abscess,  venous  sinus  thrombosis,  or  Bezold’s  abscess  (an  abscess 
medial to the sternocleidomastoid that tracks into the deep cervical  
fascia).

Evaluation  Laboratory  evaluation  reveals  elevation  of  inflamma-
tory markers and white blood cells with neutrophilia. Imaging is not 
necessary in children with a classic history and presentation but may 
be  required  if  there  is  concern  about  complications  or  severity.  CT 
may  show  disruption  of  bony  septations,  fluid,  mucosal  thickening, 
periosteal  thickening,  disruption  of  the  periosteum,  or  subperiosteal 
abscess. MRI with gadolinium permits better visualization of abscesses 
and vascular problems.

Differential  Diagnosis  The  differential  diagnosis  of  acute  mas-
toiditis includes cellulitis, otitis externa, postauricular lymphadenopa-
thy, perichondritis, and tumors, including rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing 
sarcoma, and myofibroblastic tumor.

TREATMENT
Mastoiditis

Patients  with  mastoiditis  should  be  admitted  to  the  hospital  and 
treated  with  IV  antibiotics  and  myringotomy,  with  or  without 
tympanostomy tubes; if there is no improvement within 48 h, mas-
toidectomy should be undertaken. Tympanostomy or myringotomy 
samples or subperiosteal abscess drainage should be sent for culture 
and  sensitivity  testing.  Depending  on  complications,  additional 
drainage and surgical procedures may be necessary.

Empirical  IV  antibiotic  therapy  for  children  without  recurrent 
AOM or recent antibiotic treatment consists of vancomycin (if there 
is concern about antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae or MRSA) or a 
cephalosporin (e.g., cefepime or ceftazidime). Patients with recur-
rent AOM or recent antibiotic treatment should be given vancomy-
cin  plus  an  antipseudomonal  penicillin.  Culture  and  sensitivity 
results  will  guide  antibiotic  changes.  IV  antibiotic  therapy  should 
be continued for 7–10 days, and patients should complete a 4-week 
course of oral antibiotics.

immunocompromised  can  have  rapidly  progressing  invasive  fungal 
infections (Chap. 211). More indolent fungal infections should be con-
sidered in the event of recurrent or nonresolving sinusitis. In children, 
it is important to consider the presence of a foreign body as a cause of 
sinus symptoms.

251

 ■ ACUTE SINUSITIS
Definition and Etiology  Sinusitis is an inflammation of the para-
nasal sinuses; rhinosinusitis also involves the nasal passages. The major-
ity of acute sinusitis cases are caused by respiratory viruses. A diagnosis 
of sinusitis is a major reason for unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in 
adults:  although  <2%  of  sinusitis  episodes  are  due  to  bacteria  (most 
often S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis), antibiotics are 
prescribed at >70% of office visits for sinusitis. According to guideline 
criteria,  no  more  than  50%  of  adults—and  probably  closer  to  20%—
meet the criteria for antibiotic prescribing.

Symptoms  and  Signs  Sinusitis  symptoms  commonly  include 
purulent nasal discharge, facial congestion or fullness, and facial pain 
or pressure. Other symptoms include fever; hyposmia or anosmia; ear 
pain,  pressure,  or  fullness;  postnasal  drip;  halitosis;  maxillary  tooth-
ache; cough; and fatigue. Risk factors for developing sinusitis include 
an age of 45–65 years, smoking, asthma, air travel, and allergies.

On  physical  examination,  direct  rhinoscopy  reveals  excess  mucus 
or purulence. Patients may have tenderness over the maxillary sinuses 
and, in severe cases, erythema and swelling of the maxilla. Sinus tran-
sillumination is not accurate in diagnosing sinusitis.

Complications  Complications from sinusitis can be dramatic but 
are extremely rare. These complications may include orbital cellulitis, 
osteomyelitis,  meningitis,  intracranial  abscesses,  and  cavernous  sinus 
thrombosis. New symptoms that might indicate a sinusitis complica-
tion include confusion, unilateral weakness, proptosis, limited ocular 
movements, and acute vision changes.

RECURRENT ACUTE SINUSITIS  Patients  who  have  four  or  more  epi-
sodes of acute sinusitis in a year, without signs or symptoms between 
episodes, are said to have recurrent acute sinusitis.

INVASIVE FUNGAL SINUSITIS  Invasive fungal sinusitis may develop 
in  immunocompromised  patients,  such  as  those  with  uncontrolled 
diabetes  or  transplant  recipients,  and  should  be  considered  an 
emergency.  Invasive  fungal  sinusitis  is  caused  by  Mucorales  fungi 
or  Aspergillus  (Chap.  217).  Patients  may  appear  to  have  a  rapidly 
progressive case of rhinosinusitis, with facial pain and pressure, head-
aches, and fever followed within days by cranial nerve involvement, 
orbital swelling, cellulitis, proptosis, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia. 
Patients may be critically ill. Evaluation should include nasal endos-
copy with biopsy and imaging with gadolinium-enhanced MRI as the 
preferred modality.

NOSOCOMIAL SINUSITIS  Nosocomial sinusitis occurs in critically ill 
patients,  often  those  who  are  nasotracheally  intubated.  Nosocomial 
sinusitis should be suspected in hospitalized patients who have fever 
without another identifiable cause.

SINUS SYMPTOMS
Sinus  symptoms  are  commonly  due  to  respiratory  viruses.  These 
symptoms are considered acute if they last <4 weeks, subacute if they 
last  4–12  weeks,  and  chronic  if  they  last  ≥12  weeks.  Beyond  sinus 
infection,  the  differential  diagnosis  of  rhinitis  includes  the  common 
cold,  allergic  rhinitis  (Chap.  352),  vasomotor  rhinitis,  rhinitis  medi-
camentosa  due  to  topical  decongestants,  drug-induced  rhinitis  (e.g., 
due  to  aspirin,  ibuprofen,  or  beta  blockers),  autoimmune  disease 
(e.g.,  granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis),  and  cerebrospinal  fluid  leak. 
Pain over the sinuses can be caused by headaches (Chap. 430), facial 
pain syndromes, temporomandibular disorder (Chap. 36), and dental 
pathology. Gastroesophageal reflux can cause referral of symptoms to 
the sinuses. Patients who have uncontrolled diabetes or are otherwise 

TREATMENT
Acute Sinusitis

All patients with acute sinusitis should be counseled about symptom- 
based  treatments,  which  may  include  decongestants,  analgesic/
antipyretics,  nasal  saline,  or  intranasal  glucocorticoids.  Intranasal 
decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline, two sprays in each nostril twice 
a day for no more than 5 days) and oral decongestants (e.g., 12-h 
pseudoephedrine [120 mg] during the day) relieve pain, pressure, 
and  rhinorrhea.  Analgesics  and  antipyretics  like  acetaminophen 
or  NSAIDs  (e.g.,  ibuprofen),  nasal  saline  spray,  and  nasal  washes 
provide relief. Intranasal glucocorticoids may help, particularly for

Note: In typical populations, roughly 20% and no more than 50% of adults with 
sinusitis will meet the criteria for antibiotic prescribing.

patients with an allergic cause of sinusitis. Because patients may be 
accustomed  to  receiving  antibiotics,  provision  of  a  clear  explana-
tion,  symptom-based  treatments,  and  reasons  for  reconsultation 
are important. Red flags for which patients should reconsult include 
recurrent fever of >102°F, sinus symptoms that worsen after initial 
improvement, and rapid worsening of facial pain that becomes per-
sistent, as well as any other concerning symptoms.

Antibiotic prescribing criteria for sinusitis are based on symptoms 
(Table  35-2).  Only  patients  with  persistent,  severe,  or  worsening 
symptoms, especially those who have already used decongestants and 
analgesics for 2–4 days, meet the criteria for antibiotic prescribing. 
The antibiotic of choice is amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg  
bid  for  7  days).  Amoxicillin  (875  mg  PO  bid  for  7  days)  is  an 
alternative.  For  patients  with  mild  penicillin  allergies,  cefuroxime 
is  a  reasonable  choice.  For  those  with  severe  penicillin  allergies, 
doxycycline is a reasonable alternative. Macrolides are specifically 
not recommended for sinusitis because of high rates of macrolide- 
resistant S. pneumoniae.

Patients who meet the criteria for antibiotic prescribing should 
show signs of improvement after 3–5 days of therapy. If not, second-line 
regimens include amoxicillin/clavulanate (2000 mg/125 mg bid for 
7  days)  or  levofloxacin,  although  fluoroquinolones  are  associated 
with dysglycemia, neuropathy, and tendon and aortic rupture. For 
patients  whose  condition  still  is  not  improving  after  3–5  days  of 
treatment with a second-line antibiotic or in whom a complication 
or an alternative diagnosis is suspected, clinicians should consider 
referral  to  an  otorhinolaryngologist  and/or  the  performance  of 
imaging tests. The imaging modality of choice is noncontrast CT. 
Patients  with  recurrent  acute  sinusitis  may  benefit  from  nasal 
culture  during  episodes;  imaging  between  episodes  to  identify 
predisposing anatomic abnormalities; and allergic or immunologic 
evaluation.

Patients  with  acute  fungal  sinusitis  should  be  treated  with  IV 
antifungal agents and often require surgical debridement. Patients 
with  nosocomial  sinusitis  should  have  precipitating  factors  (e.g., 
nasotracheal  intubation)  addressed  and  should  be  empirically 
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics until culture and suscepti-
bility results are available.

 ■ CHRONIC SINUSITIS
Definition and Etiology  Chronic  sinusitis  is  defined  as  inflam-
mation of the paranasal sinuses that lasts >12 weeks. Chronic sinusitis 
is primarily an inflammatory disease and can also be associated with 
acute  or  chronic  infection  or  allergic,  structural  (e.g.,  deviated  nasal 
septum or polyps), and immunologic etiologies. Repeated viral infec-
tions  may  lead  to  chronic  sinusitis.  Bacterial  colonization  or  chronic 
infection plays a role in some cases of chronic sinusitis. S. aureus and 
gram-negative bacteria are commonly identified. Commonly involved 
allergens  and  irritants  are  dust  mites,  mold,  tobacco  smoke,  occupa-
tional factors, and other airborne toxins. Functional or immunologic 
problems  can  include  impaired  mucociliary  clearance  (e.g.,  due  to 
cystic  fibrosis)  or  immunodeficiency  due  to  acquired  conditions  or 
medications. Chronic sinusitis often coexists with allergic rhinitis and 
asthma.

Symptoms and Signs  Cardinal symptoms of chronic sinusitis are 
facial pain or pressure, nasal discharge or postnasal drip, congestion, 
and hyposmia or anosmia. Associated symptoms may include fatigue, 
malaise,  ear  pressure,  hoarseness,  and  cough.  The  diagnosis  of  sinus 
inflammation  must  be  confirmed  with  anterior  rhinoscopy,  nasal 
endoscopy,  or  imaging  because  up  to  40%  of  patients  with  chronic 
sinus symptoms do not have mucosal changes evidencing disease.

In practical terms, chronic sinusitis can be divided into three main 
types  (in  decreasing  order  of  frequency):  (1)  chronic  sinusitis  with-
out  polyps,  (2)  chronic  sinusitis  with  polyps,  and  (3)  allergic  fungal 
sinusitis.  In  general,  chronic  sinusitis  without  polyps  is  more  com-
mon among women, develops in childhood and young adulthood, is 
characterized  by  presentations  with  facial  pain,  and  is  often  due  to 
TH1  lymphocyte  predominance  associated  with  bacterial  infection  or 
colonization.  Chronic  sinusitis  with  polyps  is  more  common  among 
men;  develops  in  adulthood;  is  characterized  by  presentations  with 
decrease  or  loss  of  smell,  asthma,  or  aspirin  sensitivity  (Chap.  287); 
and is often due to TH2 lymphocyte predominance associated with eos-
inophilic inflammation, asthma, or aspirin sensitivity. Allergic fungal 
rhinosinusitis is also associated with polyp formation; typically occurs 
in patients in their 20s and 30s who are from warm, humid regions and 
who  have  other  atopic  diseases;  and  is  associated  with  IgE-mediated 
allergy  and  eosinophils  (Chap.  217).  The  mucus  in  allergic  fungal 
rhinosinusitis  is  classically  greenish-brown,  has  a  peanut  butter–like 
consistency,  and  includes  viable  hyphae  from  Aspergillus  or  other 
fungal  species.  Allergic  fungal  rhinosinusitis  is  resistant  to  medical 
treatments.

Evaluation  On anterior rhinoscopy, polyps are seen as white, gray, 
tan, or yellow translucent growths in the middle meatus. The imaging 
modality  of  choice  is  noncontrast  CT.  Allergic  fungal  rhinosinusitis 
may  be  unilateral;  however,  unilateral  symptoms  or  polyps  on  exam 
or imaging, especially if associated with bloody discharge, should raise 
concern about tumors.

TREATMENT
Chronic Sinusitis

Treatment includes avoidance of identifiable triggers such as aller-
gens, smoke, and irritants. Saline sprays and washes provide symp-
tom  relief,  and  higher-volume  saline  washes  are  probably  more 
effective.  Intranasal  glucocorticoids,  including  mometasone  and 
fluticasone  sprays  or  higher-potency  and  higher-volume  budes-
onide  rinses,  are  mainstays  of  treatment,  especially  for  chronic 
sinusitis with polyps. Intranasal glucocorticoids reduce polyp size. 
Oral administration of glucocorticoids for 2–3 weeks is sometimes 
effective against chronic sinusitis that is unresponsive to intranasal 
steroids—again,  especially  for  patients  with  polyps.  Intranasal  or 
systemic  antihistamines  may  help  patients  whose  illness  has  an 
allergic component. Likewise, leukotriene antagonists like montel-
ukast may help.

Although  antibiotics  are  frequently  prescribed  for  2–4  weeks 
to patients with chronic sinusitis, there is little evidence that these 
drugs  are  effective.  Evidence  of  modest  quality  supports  the  use 
of 3 months of macrolide treatment for patients who have chronic 
sinusitis without polyps. Antifungal agents have not shown benefit 
against  any  subtype  of  chronic  sinusitis.  Decongestants  should  be 
used only sparingly and briefly.

Endoscopic sinus surgery improves quality of life in patients who 
have  had  inadequate  responses  to  medical  therapy.  Patients  with 
more  limited,  focal  disease  may  more  reliably  have  better  results. 
The goals of surgery are to remove polyps from the nasal cavity and 
paranasal  sinuses.  For  patients  with  allergic  fungal  rhinosinusitis, 
medical  therapy  is  classically  ineffective,  surgery  produces  good 
results, and patients should be treated with perioperative glucocor-
ticoids. In children, adenoidectomy may be effective in some cases. 
In  the  future,  immune  endotyping  may  allow  selection  of  more 
individualized biological treatments.

SORE THROAT AND NECK PAIN
Sore  throat  is  not  synonymous  with  pharyngitis  and  can  also  be 
caused  by  submandibular  space,  retropharyngeal  and  peritonsillar 
abscesses, thyroiditis, gastroesophageal reflux, tumors, and postnasal 
drainage.

Acute  pharyngitis,  in  which  symptoms  are  generally  present  for 
days,  is  most  often  caused  by  respiratory  viruses;  is  often  caused  by 
group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GAS); and can be caused by other 
bacteria (including Neisseria gonorrhoeae), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 
and HIV. On physical examination, pharyngeal erythema is associated 
most commonly with viral infections, including the common cold and 
influenza.  Pharyngeal  exudate  should  not  be  confused  with  Candida 
infection,  which  looks  like  cottage-cheese,  can  be  scraped  off,  and 
leaves  a  bleeding  surface,  or  leukoplakia,  which  cannot  be  scraped 
off. History and exam findings may help differentiate sore throat and 
pharyngitis of various etiologies (Table 35-3).

 ■ STREPTOCOCCAL PHARYNGITIS
GAS is the only common cause of sore throat that should be treated 
with antibiotics. The principal goal in the evaluation of adults with sore 
throat is to identify patients likely to have GAS pharyngitis, or “strep 
throat.” Prompt antibiotic treatment of adults likely to have strep throat 
has  the  potential  to  reduce  symptoms,  prevent  the  spread  of  disease, 
and  reduce  suppurative  complications  (e.g.,  peritonsillar  abscess). 
Nonsuppurative  complications  are  rare.  In  developed  countries,  the 
prevalence of rheumatic fever (Chap. 148) is extremely low, and antibi-
otic treatment does not prevent poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis 
(Chap. 148).

Most patients with non-GAS pharyngitis have various forms of viral 
pharyngitis and do not require antibiotics. Nevertheless, clinicians pre-
scribe antibiotics to a majority of adults with sore throats. By using a 
simple clinical scoring algorithm, clinicians can predict the presence or 
absence of GAS with sufficient accuracy and avoid prescribing antibi-
otics to patients who are unlikely to have strep throat. Although there is 
a role for testing (see “Evaluation,” below), most adults with sore throat 
do not need to have a GAS test.

About 10% of adults with sore throat are infected with GAS. Among 
children with sore throat, the prevalence of GAS can be as high as 35%, 
with rates peaking from 5 to 15 years of age. The prevalence of GAS is 
higher in winter and early spring. The risk of streptococcal pharyngitis 
is elevated among health care and child care workers, teachers, parents 
of  young  children,  and  patients  exposed  to  individuals  with  strep 
throat. Clinicians need to be aware of local outbreaks of GAS infection, 

particularly in military and institutional settings, where the prevalence 
of GAS and the risk of acute rheumatic fever may be elevated.

Evaluation  The  Centor  criteria  consist  of  four  findings,  each  of 
which is assigned 1 point: (1) history of fever, (2) absence of cough, (3) 
tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and (4) tonsillar exudate or 
swelling. The Centor criteria are easy to assess and accurately stratify 
adult patients with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis. Patients with 
no points have a 2% probability of being infected with GAS, whereas 
those with 4 points have a probability of 41% (Table 35-4). The Centor 
criteria have an area under the curve of 0.79. Other clinical decision 
algorithms similar to the Centor criteria may not perform as well, are 
not as simple, or have not been as rigorously evaluated.

If the test/no treatment threshold is set at 5%, for a GAS prevalence 
of ~10%, adults meeting no criteria or only one Centor criterion have a 
probability of GAS pharyngitis so low that they should neither be tested 
nor be treated with an antibiotic. Adults meeting two or three Centor 
criteria have an intermediate probability of GAS pharyngitis; they should 
have a rapid antigen test performed, and the results should guide antibi-
otic treatment. For adults meeting four Centor criteria, it is reasonable 
either to perform a rapid test or to institute empirical antibiotic treat-
ment.  However,  some  guidelines  recommend—and  some  ambulatory 
quality  measures  require—a  GAS  test  to  be  associated  with  antibiotic 
prescribing in adults, regardless of the number of Centor criteria met.

In  children,  the  Centor  criteria  are  less  specific,  and  streptococcal 
pharyngitis should be confirmed with testing. Children who have signs 
of  pharyngitis  without  signs  of  viral  infection  (conjunctivitis,  runny 
nose, cough, hoarseness, nonexudative oral lesions) should have testing 
performed.

Outside  of  the  United  States,  because  complications  are  rare  and 
even  streptococcal  pharyngitis  is  self-limited  in  the  vast  majority  of 
cases, some guidelines do not recommend use of rapid GAS testing or 
routine antibiotic treatment of sore throat.

Clinicians should have a lower threshold for diagnosing and treating 
GAS  pharyngitis  in  patients  with  a  history  of  acute  rheumatic  fever, 
patients  with  documented  streptococcal  exposure  in  the  past  week, 
patients who live in a community with a current strep throat epidemic, 
and patients who are diabetic or otherwise immunocompromised.
RAPID STREP TESTS  Rapid GAS-specific antigen tests have a sensitiv-
ity of ~80% and a specificity of ~95%. Results are available within min-
utes and can be used to make therapeutic decisions before the patient 
leaves  the  office.  Improper  collection  technique  can  adversely  affect 
the sensitivity of rapid strep tests: clinicians should rub the tonsils and 
pharynx, touching any areas where exudate or ulceration are present.
THROAT CULTURES  A single-swab throat culture has a sensitivity of 
~85–90%, as defined by isolation of GAS on a second swab. A throat 
culture can also be falsely positive for true infection: some patients with 
a culture positive for GAS may be only uninfected carriers, as defined 
by their failure to exhibit a fourfold increase in antibodies to GAS—the 
gold  standard  test.  Among  adults  and  children  seeking  medical  care 
for a sore throat, test specificity may be as low as 50–70% because of

patients  who  do  not  exhibit  serologic  evidence  of  infection.  Throat 
cultures  are  not  recommended  for  the  routine  evaluation  of  adults 
with  sore  throat.  The  modest  gain  in  sensitivity  over  rapid  testing  is 
outweighed by the 24- to 48-h delay in test results, with a consequent 
delay in the symptomatic relief associated with antibiotic treatment.

Indiscriminate strep testing in adults with sore throat or respiratory 
symptoms should be discouraged. Rapid strep tests and culture do not 
differentiate between patients who have true infection and those who 
are carriers of GAS (with carriage rates as high as 20% among school-
children and ~5% among adolescents and young adults). In adults who 
meet no Centor criteria or only one criterion—40–60% of adults with 
pharyngitis—a positive test is highly likely to be falsely positive and/or 
to represent GAS carriage.

Complications  Complications  of  streptococcal  pharyngitis  are 
rare but include acute rheumatic fever (Chap. 148), poststreptococcal 
glomerulonephritis  (Chap.  148),  scarlet  fever  (Chap.  148),  sinusitis, 
peritonsillar abscess, and other invasive GAS infections.

TREATMENT
Streptococcal Pharyngitis

All  patients  with  pharyngitis—nonstreptococcal  and  streptococcal—
should receive analgesics (acetaminophen or NSAIDs). Saline gargles, 
humidification, soft foods, and tea with honey soothe a painful throat.
Penicillin  is  the  antibiotic  of  choice  for  streptococcal  pharyn-
gitis  (Table  35-5).  Penicillin  is  a  narrow-spectrum,  low-cost,  and 
well-tolerated  drug  to  which  no  GAS  isolate  has  been  resistant. 
Amoxicillin is an acceptable alternative in children as it comes in 
a  palatable  liquid  form.  For  patients  with  mild  penicillin  allergy, 
cephalexin  and  cefadroxil  are  good  alternatives.  For  patients  with 
severe  penicillin  allergies,  clinicians  should  prescribe  erythromy-
cin,  clarithromycin,  or  clindamycin.  Unlike  other  infections  for 
which emerging evidence supports progressively shorter antibiotic 
courses, streptococcal pharyngitis requires longer courses (7–10 days), 
which are more effective.

Glucocorticoids  (e.g.,  dexamethasone,  10  mg  as  a  single  oral 
dose)  have  so  far  been  poorly  studied  as  an  adjunctive  treatment 
for sore throat and strep throat and are not recommended. These 
drugs may result in decreased pain within 24 h but do not decrease 
school or work absenteeism or relapse rates. Even short courses of 
steroids are associated with increased rates of sepsis, gastrointesti-
nal  bleeding,  congestive  heart  failure,  venous  thromboembolism, 
and fracture within 30 days.

Streptococcal  and  nonstreptococcal  pharyngitis  should  resolve 
in 3–5 days. Symptoms that should lead patients to seek further care 
include  shaking  chills  (rigors),  neck  swelling  (beyond  lymphade-
nopathy),  trouble  swallowing,  drooling,  or  symptoms  that  persist 
for >5 days without improvement.

 ■ NONSTREPTOCOCCAL PHARYNGITIS
Acute  Infectious  Mononucleosis  New  EBV  infection  may  be 
the cause of pharyngitis in 1–6% of young adults (Chap. 194). EBV is 
rarely the cause of pharyngitis in adults >40 years of age. The full-blown 
acute syndrome, which is present in only about one-fourth of patients 
with infectious mononucleosis (“mono”), is characterized by a triad of 
clinical, hematologic, and serologic findings. The clinical presentation 
is typified by the development over several days of malaise, fever, sore 
throat, and marked adenopathy that is particularly evident in the cer-
vical  lymph  nodes.  On  physical  examination,  marked  adenopathy  is 
virtually  always  documented  and  is  most  specific  for  mononucleosis 
when the posterior cervical or posterior auricular nodes are involved. 
Splenomegaly  and  exudative  pharyngitis  with  prominent  tonsillar 
swelling,  palatine  petechiae,  and  a  gelatinous  uvula  are  often  noted. 
The classic hematologic findings are an absolute lymphocyte count of 
>4000/μL  or  a  relative  lymphocyte  count  of  >50%  with  “atypical” 
morphologic features in >10% of the lymphocytes. The characteristic 
serologic  finding  is  the  heterophil  antibody,  which  is  detectable  in 
only 40% of patients during the first week of illness but in 80–90% of 
patients by the third week.

Other  Bacterial  Pharyngitis  Non–group  A  streptococci  (espe-
cially  group  C  and  group  G  streptococci),  Mycoplasma  pneumoniae, 
Chlamydia  pneumoniae,  N.  gonorrhoeae,  and  H.  influenzae  have  all 
been  associated  with  sore  throat  in  some  studies.  Although  antibac-
terial treatment has not been proven to speed the resolution of symp-
toms and signs of any of these types of nonstreptococcal pharyngitis, 
antibiotic treatment is indicated if throat cultures from a patient with 
persistent sore throat yield group C or group G streptococci.
LEMIERRE’S  SYNDROME  Lemierre’s  syndrome  consists  of  septic 
thrombophlebitis  of  the  internal  jugular  vein  accompanied  by  met-
astatic  infections,  most  commonly  of  the  lung  but  with  possible 
involvement of the joints, bones, liver, meninges, and brain. Lemierre’s 
syndrome is most commonly caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, 
although  it  can  also  be  caused  by  species  of  Bacteroides,  Eikenella, 
Streptococcus,  Peptostreptococcus,  or  other  bacterial  genera.  This  syn-
drome  probably  occurs  predominantly  in  male  patients.  Clinicians 
should  consider  Lemierre’s  syndrome  in  a  teenage  or  young  adult 
patient who has non-GAS pharyngitis that is not resolving, particularly 
if it is accompanied by rigors, neck pain or swelling, or other extraphar-
yngeal symptoms.
GONOCOCCAL  PHARYNGITIS  N.  gonorrhoeae  may  be  the  cause  of 
pharyngitis  in  1%  of  adult  patients  seeking  primary  care  for  a  sore 
throat,  although  gonococcal  infection  of  the  pharynx  is  more  often 
asymptomatic. When symptomatic, pharyngeal gonorrhea may range 
from mild to severe, with protracted pharyngitis characterized by pain, 
fever,  and  pharyngeal  exudate.  Gonococcal  pharyngitis  should  be 
suspected in men who have sex with men with associated symptoms 
of urogenital infection, women who have practiced fellatio with a man 
with  genital  gonorrhea,  and  anyone  who  has  persistent  sore  throat 
that has been unresponsive to treatment for presumptive streptococcal 
pharyngitis.
DIPHTHERIA  Diphtheria,  caused  by  Corynebacterium  diphtheriae,  is 
endemic in developing countries (Chap. 150). Diphtheria produces only 
mild pharyngitis beneath its characteristic grayish pseudomembrane.
ACUTE HIV INFECTION  Clinicians should consider acute HIV infec-
tion  in  patients  with  sore  throat,  particularly  when  it  is  associated 
with headache, fever, myalgias, lymphadenopathy, anorexia, and rash 
(Chap. 202). Of patients with acute HIV infection, roughly half have a 
sore throat. However, in most settings in the United States, only ~1% 
of patients with viral or mononucleosis-like symptoms have acute HIV 
infection.

 ■ HEAD AND NECK ABSCESSES
Head and neck abscesses are more common among patients with diabetes, 
who are immunocompromised, and among older adults. Such abscesses 
are  often  a  complication  of  infections  of  the  teeth  and  gums,  throat,

or salivary ducts; lymphadenitis; ear infections; sinus infections; con-
genital  cysts;  and  IV  drug  use.  Prompt  recognition  is  important,  as 
head and neck abscesses can cause airway compromise due to edema 
or mass effect. Head and neck abscesses can follow fascial planes and 
spread to the mediastinum (where they can cause mediastinitis, pleural 
effusions, empyema, or pericarditis), the carotid sheath, the skull base, 
and the meninges. Head and neck abscesses have also been associated 
with aspiration pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, Lemierre’s syndrome, 
and toxic shock syndrome.

Submandibular  abscesses  generally  result  from  an  infected  or 
extracted tooth and can cause Ludwig angina, a swelling of the floor of 
the mouth that can enlarge and displace the tongue posteriorly.

Peritonsillar  abscesses,  which  may  occur  predominantly  in  male 
patients,  generally  result  from  complicated  bacterial  pharyngitis  and 
present  with  fever,  dysphagia,  profound  throat  pain  (necessitating 
drooling to avoid swallowing saliva), trismus, and “hot potato voice” 
(inability  to  articulate,  as  if  patients  have  hot  food  in  their  mouths). 
Patients are likely to have unilateral palate bulging, often with uvular 
deviation. Peritonsillar abscesses are caused by viridans group strepto-
cocci, β-hemolytic streptococci, F. necrophorum, S. aureus, Prevotella, 
and Bacteroides.

Retropharyngeal abscesses often present after an antecedent URI in 
children  with  sore  throat,  dysphagia,  deep  neck  pain,  neck  stiffness, 
trismus,  and  drooling.  The  pharyngeal  wall  may  be  displaced,  but 
swelling  or  abscess  may  not  be  apparent  on  examination.  In  severe 
cases, patients may have dyspnea and stridor.

Patients with suspected head and neck abscesses, with the possible 
exception of patients who have obvious peritonsillar abscesses, should 
undergo imaging by CT.

TREATMENT
Head and Neck Abscesses

The mainstays of treatment for head and neck abscesses are secur-
ing the airway, surgical drainage, and IV antibiotic administration. 
To secure the airway, mask ventilation or oral intubation may not 
be effective, and oral fiberoptic intubation or tracheotomy may be 
necessary. Peritonsillar abscess may be managed with needle aspi-
ration and/or tonsillectomy. Other head and neck abscesses require 
incision  and  drainage.  The  selected  IV  antibiotics  should  cover 
streptococci,  anaerobes,  and  possibly  S.  aureus.  Frequently  used 
antibiotics include ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin plus ceftriax-
one,  or  meropenem.  For  some  abscesses  with  adequate  source 
control with incision and drainage, penicillin may be as effective as 
broader-spectrum agents.

 ■ EPIGLOTTITIS
Along with associated dysphagia, odynophagia, hoarseness, and stridor 
or tachypnea, supraglottitis or epiglottitis must be considered in adults 
presenting with sore throat. The inflamed and enlarged epiglottis pro-
trudes up into the oropharynx. Patients may extend their neck or lean 
forward and drool oral secretions to avoid swallowing. Epiglottitis can 
cause  “hot  potato  voice.”  Attempts  to  examine  or  swab  the  posterior 
pharynx  or  obtain  a  culture  can  provoke  laryngospasm  and  should 
only  be  done  carefully  in  a  controlled  setting.  Because  obstruction 
of  the  airway  may  become  acutely  life-threatening,  the  patient  with 
epiglottitis must be observed in a hospital setting, and examination in 
an operating room, where an airway can be established immediately by 
an experienced operator, should be strongly considered. Although not 
necessary for the diagnosis, a lateral neck radiograph can demonstrate 
epiglottal swelling referred to as the “thumb sign.”

In  adults,  conservative  therapy  under  observation  is  sufficient  in 
most cases, but intubation by an experienced clinician or tracheostomy 
may  become  necessary.  Treatments  also  include  humidification  with 
nebulized normal saline or humidified oxygen and administration of 
glucocorticoids, IV antibiotics, and nebulized epinephrine.

H. influenzae, the most common cause of supraglottitis in children, 
is  less  common  in  adults.  Other  responsible  organisms  in  adults  are 
S.  pneumoniae,  S.  pyogenes,  and  S.  aureus.  The  H.  influenzae  type  b 
vaccine has led to a dramatic decrease in epiglottitis overall, with large 
reductions in young children; however, the incidence of supraglottitis 
and epiglottitis in adults may be increasing.
 ■ LARYNGITIS
Laryngitis—inflammation of the larynx and surrounding structures—
is  most  commonly  caused  by  viral  URIs.  In  children,  parainfluenza 
virus can cause croup, or laryngotracheobronchitis, which is character-
ized by a “barking” cough but can also include laryngitis.

Beyond  viruses,  laryngitis  can  be  caused  in  rare  cases  by  bacteria 
and fungi. Bacterial laryngitis can be a complication of viral laryngitis, 
occurring  about  7  days  into  the  illness.  The  most  common  bacteria 
involved are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. Fungal 
laryngitis is probably rarer but should be considered in patients who 
are  immunosuppressed  or  who  have  recently  been  treated  with  anti-
bacterial drugs.

Noninfectious causes of laryngitis include vocal trauma (e.g., due to 
yelling, screaming, or loud singing), inhalation injuries, allergies, gas-
troesophageal  reflux  disease  (laryngopharyngeal  reflux),  asthma,  and 
pollution.  Immunosuppressed  patients  are  at  risk  for  infections  with 
herpesvirus, HIV, and coxsackievirus. Smokers are at elevated risk for 
malignancy and other infections.

Laryngitis  is  characterized  by  a  raspy,  hoarse,  or  breathy  voice, 
sometimes progressing to a complete loss of voice. Laryngitis can have 
associated  dry  cough  and  anterior  throat  pain;  patients  often  feel  a 
need to clear their throats. The physical examination in patients who 
may have laryngitis should focus on the head, neck, and lungs, but the 
diagnosis  of  laryngitis  is  generally  based  on  history.  If  visualization 
of the vocal cords is necessary, indirect examination with a mirror or 
flexible laryngoscopy usually shows erythema and edema of the vocal 
cords and surrounding structures.

TREATMENT
Laryngitis

Laryngitis is generally self-limited, usually lasting 3–7 days, but may 
last up to 14 days. Vocal rest is crucial. Airway humidification and 
hydration  should  help.  Patients  likely  to  have  laryngopharyngeal 
reflux  should  avoid  gastroesophageal  reflux–inducing  foods  and 
behaviors  and  should  take  antireflux  medications.  In  randomized 
controlled trials, antibiotics were not effective in decreasing objec-
tive symptoms of laryngitis.

Red  flags  for  emergency  evaluation  and  monitoring  include 
shortness of breath, stridor, dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling, and 
posturing  that  could  indicate  epiglottitis.  Referral  to  an  otolaryn-
gologist should be considered for patients who rely on their voice 
for  work,  such  as  singers  and  teachers.  A  history  of  smoking  or 
weight loss should raise suspicion of malignancy. Symptoms lasting 
>3 weeks should prompt referral to an otolaryngologist or speech 
specialist.

36 Oral Manifestations  
of Disease
Samuel C. Durso

As primary care physicians and consultants, internists are often asked 
to  evaluate  patients  with  disease  of  the  oral  soft  tissues,  teeth,  and 
pharynx.  Knowledge  of  the  oral  milieu  and  its  unique  structures  is 
necessary  to  guide  preventive  services  and  recognize  oral  manifesta-
tions of local or systemic disease (Chap. A3). Furthermore, internists 
frequently collaborate with dentists in the care of patients who have a 
variety  of  medical  conditions  that  affect  oral  health  or  who  undergo 
dental procedures that increase their risk of medical complications.

 ■ DISEASES OF THE TEETH AND PERIODONTAL 
STRUCTURES
Tooth  formation  begins  during  the  sixth  week  of  embryonic  life  and 
continues  through  17  years  of  age.  Teeth  start  to  develop  in  utero 
and continue to develop until after the tooth erupts. Normally, all 20 
deciduous teeth have erupted by age 3 and have been shed by age 13. 
Permanent  teeth,  eventually  totaling  32,  begin  to  erupt  by  age  6  and 
have  completely  erupted  by  age  14,  though  third  molars  (“wisdom 
teeth”) may erupt later.

The erupted tooth consists of the visible crown covered with enamel 
and the root submerged below the gum line and covered with bonelike 
cementum. Dentin, a material that is denser than bone and exquisitely 
sensitive to pain, forms the majority of the tooth substance, surround-
ing  a  core  of  myxomatous  pulp  containing  the  vascular  and  nerve 
supply.  The  tooth  is  held  firmly  in  the  alveolar  socket  by  the  peri-
odontium, supporting structures that consist of the gingivae, alveolar 
bone, cementum, and periodontal ligament. The periodontal ligament 
tenaciously  binds  the  tooth’s  cementum  to  the  alveolar  bone.  Above 
this ligament is a collar of attached gingiva just below the crown. A few 
millimeters of unattached or free gingiva (1–3 mm) overlap the base 
of the crown, forming a shallow sulcus along the gum-tooth margin.

Dental  Caries,  Pulpal  and  Periapical  Disease,  and  
Complications  Dental  caries  usually  begin  asymptomatically  as 
a  destructive  infectious  process  of  the  enamel.  Bacteria—principally 
Streptococcus mutans—colonize the organic buffering biofilm (plaque) 
on  the  tooth  surface.  If  not  removed  by  brushing  or  by  the  natural 
cleansing and antibacterial action of saliva, bacterial acids can demin-
eralize  the  enamel.  Fissures  and  pits  on  the  occlusal  surfaces  are  the 
most frequent sites of early decay. Surfaces between the teeth, adjacent 
to tooth restorations and exposed roots, are also vulnerable, particu-
larly as individuals age. Over time, dental caries extend to the underly-
ing dentin, leading to cavitation of the enamel. Without management, 
the caries will penetrate to the tooth pulp, producing acute pulpitis. At 
this stage, when the pulp infection is limited, the tooth may become 
sensitive  to  percussion  and  to  hot  or  cold,  and  pain  resolves  imme-
diately when the irritating stimulus is removed. Should the infection 
spread throughout the pulp, irreversible pulpitis occurs, leading to pulp 
necrosis. At this later stage, pain can be severe and has a sharp or throb-
bing  visceral  quality  that  may  be  worse  when  the  patient  lies  down. 
Once pulp necrosis is complete, pain may be constant or intermittent, 
but cold sensitivity is lost.

Treatment  of  caries  involves  removal  of  the  softened  and  infected 
hard tissue and restoration of the tooth structure with silver amalgam, 
glass  ionomer,  composite  resin,  or  gold.  Once  irreversible  pulpitis 
occurs, root canal therapy becomes necessary; removal of the contents 
of the pulp chamber and root canal is followed by thorough cleaning 
and  filling  with  an  inert  material.  Alternatively,  the  tooth  may  be 
extracted.

Pulpal  infection  leads  to  periapical  abscess  formation,  which  can 
produce pain on chewing. If the infection is mild and chronic, a peri-
apical granuloma or eventually a periapical cyst forms, either of which 

produces radiolucency at the root apex. When unchecked, a periapical 
abscess  can  erode  into  the  alveolar  bone,  producing  osteomyelitis; 
penetrate and drain through the gingivae, producing a parulis (gum-
boil);  or  track  along  deep  fascial  planes,  producing  virulent  cellulitis 
(Ludwig’s angina) involving the submandibular space and floor of the 
mouth  (Chap. 177).  Elderly  patients,  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus, 
and patients taking glucocorticoids may experience little or no pain or 
fever as these complications develop.

Periodontal Disease  Periodontal disease and dental caries are the 
primary causes of tooth loss. Like dental caries, chronic infection of the 
gingiva  and  anchoring  structures  of  the  tooth  begins  with  formation 
of  bacterial  plaque.  The  process  begins  at  the  gum  line.  Plaque  and 
calculus  (calcified  plaque)  are  preventable  by  appropriate  daily  oral 
hygiene,  including  periodic  professional  cleaning.  Left  undisturbed, 
chronic  inflammation  can  ensue  and  produce  hyperemia  of  the  free 
and  attached  gingivae  (gingivitis),  which  then  typically  bleed  with 
brushing.  If  this  issue  is  ignored,  severe  periodontitis  can  develop, 
leading to deepening of the physiologic sulcus and destruction of the 
periodontal  ligament.  Gingival  pockets  develop  around  the  teeth.  As 
the  periodontium  (including  the  supporting  bone)  is  destroyed,  the 
teeth loosen. A role for chronic inflammation due to chronic periodon-
tal  disease  in  promoting  coronary  heart  disease  and  stroke  has  been 
proposed.  Epidemiologic  studies  have  demonstrated  a  moderate  but 
significant association between chronic periodontal inflammation and 
atherogenesis, though a causal role remains unproven.

Acute and aggressive forms of periodontal disease are less common 
than the chronic forms described above. However, if the host is stressed 
or  exposed  to  a  new  pathogen,  rapidly  progressive  and  destructive 
disease  of  the  periodontal  tissue  can  occur.  A  virulent  example  is 
acute  necrotizing  ulcerative  gingivitis.  The  presentation  includes  sud-
den  gingival  inflammation,  ulceration,  bleeding,  interdental  gingival 
necrosis,  and  fetid  halitosis.  Localized  juvenile  periodontitis,  which  is 
seen in adolescents, is particularly destructive and appears to be asso-
ciated with impaired neutrophil chemotaxis. AIDS-related periodontitis 
resembles acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis in some patients and a 
more destructive form of adult chronic periodontitis in others. It may 
also produce a gangrene-like destructive process of the oral soft tissues 
and bone that resembles noma, an infectious condition seen in severely 
malnourished children in developing nations.

Prevention of Tooth Decay and Periodontal Infection  Despite 
the reduced prevalences of dental caries and periodontal disease in the 
United  States  (due  in  large  part  to  water  fluoridation  and  improved 
dental  care,  respectively),  both  diseases  constitute  a  major  public 
health problem worldwide, particularly in certain groups. The internist 
should  promote  preventive  dental  care  and  hygiene  as  part  of  health 
maintenance. Populations at high risk for dental caries and periodontal 
disease include those with hyposalivation and/or xerostomia, diabetics, 
alcoholics,  tobacco  users,  persons  with  Down  syndrome,  and  those 
with  gingival  hyperplasia.  Furthermore,  patients  lacking  access  to 
dental care (e.g., as a result of low socioeconomic status) and patients 
with a reduced ability to provide self-care (e.g., individuals with dis-
abilities, nursing home residents, and persons with dementia or upper- 
extremity disability) suffer at a disproportionate rate. It is important to 
provide counseling regarding regular dental hygiene and professional 
cleaning,  use  of  fluoride-containing  toothpaste,  professional  fluoride 
treatments,  and  (for  patients  with  limited  dexterity)  use  of  electric 
toothbrushes  and  also  to  instruct  persons  caring  for  those  who  are 
not  capable  of  self-care.  Cost,  fear  of  dental  care,  and  differences  in 
language  and  culture  create  barriers  that  prevent  some  people  from 
seeking preventive dental services.

Developmental and Systemic Disease Affecting the Teeth and 
Periodontium 
In addition to posing cosmetic issues, malocclusion, 
the most common developmental oral problem, can interfere with mas-
tication unless corrected through orthodontic and surgical techniques. 
Impacted third molars are common and can become infected or erupt 
into  an  insufficient  space.  Acquired  prognathism  due  to  acromegaly 
may  also  lead  to  malocclusion,  as  may  deformity  of  the  maxilla  and

mandible  due  to  Paget’s  disease  of  the  bone.  Delayed  tooth  eruption, 
a  receding  chin,  and  a  protruding  tongue  are  occasional  features  of 
cretinism and hypopituitarism. Congenital syphilis produces tapering, 
notched  (Hutchinson’s)  incisors  and  finely  nodular  (mulberry)  molar 
crowns. Enamel hypoplasia results in crown defects ranging from pits 
to deep fissures of primary or permanent teeth. Intrauterine infection 
(syphilis, rubella), vitamin deficiency (A, C, or D), disorders of calcium 
metabolism (malabsorption, vitamin D–resistant rickets, hypoparathy-
roidism), prematurity, high fever, and rare inherited defects (amelogen-
esis  imperfecta)  are  all  causes.  Tetracycline,  given  in  sufficiently  high 
doses during the first 8 years of life, may produce enamel hypoplasia 
and discoloration. Doxycycline does not cause permanent tooth stain-
ing  in  children  despite  warnings  included  for  all  tetracycline-class 
antibiotics. Exposure to endogenous pigments can discolor developing 
teeth; etiologies include erythroblastosis fetalis (green or bluish-black), 
congenital  liver  disease  (green  or  yellow-brown),  and  porphyria  (red 
or brown that fluoresces with ultraviolet light). Mottled enamel occurs 
if excessive fluoride is ingested during development. Worn enamel is 
seen with age, bruxism, or excessive acid exposure (e.g., chronic gastric 
reflux or bulimia). Celiac disease is associated with nonspecific enamel 
defects in children but not in adults.

Total or partial tooth loss resulting from periodontitis is seen with 
cyclic neutropenia, Papillon-Lefévre syndrome, Chédiak-Higashi syn-
drome,  and  leukemia.  Rapid  focal  tooth  loosening  is  most  often  due 
to  infection,  but  rarer  causes  include  Langerhans  cell  histiocytosis, 
Ewing’s sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and Burkitt’s lymphoma. Early loss of 
primary teeth is a feature of hypophosphatasia, a rare congenital error 
of metabolism.

Pregnancy  may  produce  gingivitis  and  localized  pyogenic  granu-
lomas.  Severe  periodontal  disease  occurs  in  uncontrolled  diabetes 
mellitus.  Drug-induced  gingival  overgrowth  may  be  caused  by  anti-
convulsants,  calcium  channel  blockers,  and  immunosuppressants, 
although excellent daily oral care can prevent or reduce its occurrence. 
Idiopathic  familial  gingival  fibromatosis  and  several  syndrome-related 
disorders cause similar conditions. Discontinuation of the medication 
may reverse the drug-induced form, although surgery may be needed 
to control both of the latter entities. Linear gingival erythema is variably 
seen in patients with advanced HIV infection and probably represents 
immune deficiency and decreased neutrophil activity. Diffuse or focal 
gingival swelling may be a feature of early or late acute myelomono-
cytic  leukemia  as  well  as  of  other  lymphoproliferative  disorders.  A 
rare but pathognomonic sign of granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a 
red-purplish, granular gingivitis (strawberry gums).

 ■ DISEASES OF THE ORAL MUCOSA
Infections  Most  oral  mucosal  diseases  involve  microorganisms 
(Table 36-1).

Pigmented Lesions  See Table 36-2.

Dermatologic  Diseases  See  Tables  36-1,  36-2,  and  36-3  and 
Chaps. 56–61.

Diseases of the Tongue  See Table 36-4.

HIV  Disease  and  AIDS  See  Tables  36-1,  36-2,  36-3,  and  36-5; 
Chap. 202.

Ulcers  Ulceration  is  the  most  common  oral  mucosal  lesion. 
Although there are many causes, the host and the pattern of lesions, 
including  the  presence  of  organ  system  features,  narrow  the  differ-
ential  diagnosis  (Table  36-1).  Most  acute  ulcers  are  painful  and  self- 
limited.  Recurrent  aphthous  ulcers  and  herpes  simplex  account  for 
the majority. Persistent and deep aphthous ulcers can be idiopathic or 
can accompany HIV/AIDS. Aphthous lesions are often the presenting 
symptom in Behçet’s syndrome (Chap. 364). Similar-appearing, though 
less painful, lesions may occur in reactive arthritis, and aphthous ulcers 
are  occasionally  present  during  phases  of  discoid  or  systemic  lupus 
erythematosus  (Chap.  360).  Aphthous-like  ulcers  are  seen  in  Crohn’s 
disease  (Chap.  326),  but,  unlike  the  common  aphthous  variety,  they 

may  exhibit  granulomatous  inflammation  on  histologic  examination. 
Recurrent  aphthae  are  more  prevalent  in  patients  with  celiac  disease 
and have been reported to remit with elimination of gluten.

Of major concern are chronic, relatively painless ulcers and mixed 
red/white patches (erythroplakia and leukoplakia) of >2 weeks’ dura-
tion. Squamous cell carcinoma and premalignant dysplasia should be 
considered  early  and  a  diagnostic  biopsy  performed.  This  awareness 
and this procedure are critically important because early-stage malig-
nancy  is  vastly  more  treatable  than  late-stage  disease.  High-risk  sites 
include  the  lower  lip,  floor  of  the  mouth,  ventral  and  lateral  tongue, 
and soft palate–tonsillar pillar complex. Significant risk factors for oral 
cancer in Western countries include sun exposure (lower lip), tobacco 
and  alcohol  use,  and  human  papillomavirus  infection.  In  India  and 
some other Asian countries, smokeless tobacco mixed with betel nut, 
slaked lime, and spices is a common cause of oral cancer. Rarer causes 
of chronic oral ulcer, such as tuberculosis, fungal infection, granuloma-
tosis with polyangiitis, and midline granuloma, may look identical to 
carcinoma. Making the correct diagnosis depends on recognizing other 
clinical features and performing a biopsy of the lesion. The syphilitic 
chancre  is  typically  painless  and  therefore  easily  missed.  Regional 
lymphadenopathy is invariably present. The syphilitic etiology is con-
firmed with appropriate bacterial and serologic tests.

Disorders  of  mucosal  fragility  often  produce  painful  oral  ulcers 
that  fail  to  heal  within  2  weeks.  Mucous  membrane  pemphigoid  and 
pemphigus vulgaris are the major acquired disorders. While their clin-
ical  features  are  often  distinctive,  a  biopsy  or  immunohistochemical 
examination  should  be  performed  to  diagnose  these  entities  and  to 
distinguish them from lichen planus and drug reactions.

Hematologic  and  Nutritional  Disease 
Internists  are  more 
likely  to  encounter  patients  with  acquired,  rather  than  congenital, 
bleeding  disorders.  Bleeding  should  stop  15  min  after  minor  trauma 
and within an hour after tooth extraction if local pressure is applied. 
More prolonged bleeding, if not due to continued injury or rupture of 
a large vessel, should lead to investigation for a clotting abnormality. 
In addition to bleeding, petechiae and ecchymoses are prone to occur 
at the vibrating line between the soft and hard palates in patients with 
platelet dysfunction or thrombocytopenia.

All forms of leukemia, but particularly acute myelomonocytic leuke-
mia, can produce gingival bleeding, ulcers, and gingival enlargement. 
Oral ulcers are a feature of agranulocytosis, and ulcers and mucositis 
are often severe complications of chemotherapy and radiation therapy 
for  hematologic  and  other  malignancies.  Plummer-Vinson  syndrome 
(iron  deficiency,  angular  stomatitis,  glossitis,  and  dysphagia)  raises 
the  risk  of  oral  squamous  cell  cancer  and  esophageal  cancer  at  the 
postcricoidal tissue web. Atrophic papillae and a red, burning tongue 
may occur with pernicious anemia. Deficiencies in B-group vitamins 
produce many of these same symptoms as well as oral ulceration and 
cheilosis.  Consequences  of  scurvy  include  swollen,  bleeding  gums; 
ulcers; and loosening of the teeth.

NONDENTAL CAUSES OF ORAL PAIN
Most, but not all, oral pain emanates from inflamed or injured tooth 
pulp  or  periodontal  tissues.  Nonodontogenic  causes  are  often  over-
looked. In most instances, toothache is predictable and proportional to 
the stimulus applied, and an identifiable condition (e.g., caries, abscess) 
is  found.  Local  anesthesia  eliminates  pain  originating  from  dental 
or periodontal structures, but not referred pains. The most common 
nondental source of pain is myofascial pain referred from muscles of 
mastication, which become tender and ache with increased use. Many 
sufferers exhibit bruxism (grinding of the teeth) secondary to stress and 
anxiety. Temporomandibular joint disorder is closely related. It affects 
both sexes, with a higher prevalence among women. Features include 
pain,  limited  mandibular  movement,  and  temporomandibular  joint 
sounds.  The  etiologies  are  complex;  malocclusion  does  not  play  the 
primary role once attributed to it. Osteoarthritis is a common cause of 
masticatory pain. Anti-inflammatory medication, jaw rest, soft foods, 
and  heat  provide  relief.  The  temporomandibular  joint  is  involved 
in  50%  of  patients  with  rheumatoid  arthritis,  and  its  involvement  is

usually a late feature of severe disease. Bilateral preauricular pain, par-
ticularly in the morning, limits range of motion.

Migrainous  neuralgia  may  be  localized  to  the  mouth.  Episodes  of 
pain  and  remission  without  an  identifiable  cause  and  a  lack  of  relief 
with  local  anesthesia  are  important  clues.  Trigeminal  neuralgia  (tic 
douloureux)  can  involve  the  entire  branch  or  part  of  the  mandibular 
or maxillary branch of the fifth cranial nerve and can produce pain in 
one or a few teeth. Pain may occur spontaneously or may be triggered 
by  touching  the  lip  or  gingiva,  brushing  the  teeth,  or  chewing.  Glos-
sopharyngeal neuralgia produces similar acute neuropathic symptoms 

in  the  distribution  of  the  ninth  cranial  nerve.  Swallowing,  sneezing, 
coughing, or pressure on the tragus of the ear triggers pain that is felt 
in the base of the tongue, pharynx, and soft palate and may be referred 
to the temporomandibular joint. Neuritis involving the maxillary and 
mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve (e.g., maxillary sinusitis, 
neuroma,  and  leukemic  infiltrate)  is  distinguished  from  ordinary 
toothache by the neuropathic quality of the pain. Occasionally, phan-
tom  pain  follows  tooth  extraction.  Pain  and  hyperalgesia  behind  the 
ear and on the side of the face in the day or so before facial weakness 
develops often constitute the earliest symptom of Bell’s palsy. Likewise,

similar symptoms may precede visible lesions of herpes zoster infect-
ing  the  seventh  nerve  (Ramsey-Hunt  syndrome)  or  trigeminal  nerve. 
Postherpetic neuralgia may follow either condition. Coronary ischemia 
may produce pain exclusively in the face and jaw; as in typical angina 
pectoris,  this  pain  is  usually  reproducible  with  increased  myocardial 
demand. Aching in several upper molar or premolar teeth that is unre-
lieved by anesthetizing the teeth may point to maxillary sinusitis.

Giant cell arteritis is notorious for producing headache, but it may 
also  produce  facial  pain  or  sore  throat  without  headache.  Jaw  and 
tongue  claudication  with  chewing  or  talking  is  relatively  common. 
Tongue  infarction  is  rare.  Patients  with  subacute  thyroiditis  often 
experience pain referred to the face or jaw before the tenderness of the 
thyroid gland and transient hyperthyroidism are appreciated.

“Burning  mouth  syndrome”  (glossodynia)  occurs  in  the  absence 
of  an  identifiable  cause  (e.g.,  vitamin  B12  deficiency,  iron  deficiency,  
diabetes mellitus, low-grade Candida infection, food sensitivity, or sub-
tle xerostomia) and predominantly affects postmenopausal women. The 
etiology may be neuropathic. Clonazepam, α-lipoic acid, and cognitive- 
behavioral therapy have benefited some patients. Some cases associated 
with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor have remitted when 
treatment with the drug was discontinued.

 ■ DISEASES OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS
Saliva  is  essential  to  oral  health.  Its  absence  leads  to  dental  caries, 
periodontal disease, and difficulties in wearing dental prostheses, mas-
ticating, and speaking. Its major components, water and mucin, serve 
as  a  cleansing  solvent  and  lubricating  fluid.  In  addition,  saliva  con-
tains  antimicrobial  factors  (e.g.,  lysozyme,  lactoperoxidase,  secretory 
IgA),  epidermal  growth  factor,  minerals,  and  buffering  systems.  The 
major salivary glands secrete intermittently in response to autonomic 
stimulation, which is high during a meal but low otherwise. Hundreds 

of  minor  glands  in  the  lips  and  cheeks  secrete  mucus  continuously 
throughout  the  day  and  night.  Consequently,  oral  function  becomes 
impaired  when  salivary  function  is  reduced.  The  sensation  of  a  dry 
mouth  (xerostomia)  is  perceived  when  salivary  flow  is  reduced  by 
50%. The most common etiology is medication, especially drugs with 
anticholinergic  properties  but  also  alpha  and  beta  blockers,  calcium 
channel  blockers,  and  diuretics.  Other  causes  include  Sjögren’s  syn-
drome, chronic parotitis, salivary duct obstruction, diabetes mellitus, 
HIV/AIDS, and radiation therapy that includes the salivary glands in 
the field (e.g., for Hodgkin’s lymphoma and for head and neck cancer). 
Management involves the elimination or limitation of drying medica-
tions, preventive dental care, and supplementation with oral liquid or 
salivary  substitutes.  Sugarless  mints  or  chewing  gum  may  stimulate 
salivary  secretion  if  dysfunction  is  mild.  When  sufficient  exocrine 
tissue remains, pilocarpine or cevimeline has been shown to increase 
secretions. Commercial saliva substitutes or gels relieve dryness. Fluo-
ride supplementation is critical to prevent caries.

Sialolithiasis  presents  most  often  as  painful  swelling  but  in  some 
instances as only swelling or only pain. Conservative therapy consists 
of local heat, massage, and hydration. Promotion of salivary secretion 
with  mints  or  lemon  drops  may  flush  out  small  stones.  Antibiotic 
treatment is necessary when bacterial infection in suspected. In adults, 
acute  bacterial  parotitis  is  typically  unilateral  and  most  commonly 
affects  postoperative,  dehydrated,  and  debilitated  patients.  Staphylo-
coccus  aureus  (including  methicillin-resistant  strains)  and  anaerobic 
bacteria are the most common pathogens. Chronic bacterial sialadeni-
tis results from lowered salivary secretion and recurrent bacterial infec-
tion. When suspected bacterial infection is not responsive to therapy, 
the  differential  diagnosis  should  be  expanded  to  include  benign  and 
malignant  neoplasms,  lymphoproliferative  disorders,  Sjögren’s  syn-
drome,  sarcoidosis,  tuberculosis,  lymphadenitis,  actinomycosis,  and

granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Bilateral nontender parotid enlarge-
ment occurs with diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, bulimia, HIV/AIDS, and 
drugs (e.g., iodide, propylthiouracil).

Pleomorphic  adenoma  composes  two-thirds  of  all  salivary  neo-
plasms.  The  parotid  is  the  principal  salivary  gland  affected,  and  the 
tumor presents as a firm, slow-growing mass. Although this tumor is 
benign, its recurrence is common if resection is incomplete. Malignant 
tumors such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, 
and  adenocarcinoma  tend  to  grow  relatively  fast,  depending  upon 
grade. They may ulcerate and invade nerves, producing numbness and 
facial paralysis. Surgical resection is the primary treatment. Radiation 
therapy  (particularly  neutron-beam  therapy)  is  used  when  surgery  is 
not feasible and after resection for certain histologic types with a high 
risk of recurrence. Malignant salivary gland tumors have a 5-year sur-
vival rate of 94% when the stage is local and 35% when distant.

Dental  Care  for  Medically  Complex  Patients  Routine  den-
tal  care  (e.g.,  uncomplicated  extraction,  scaling  and  cleaning,  tooth 
restoration,  and  root  canal)  is  remarkably  safe.  The  most  common 
concerns  regarding  care  of  dental  patients  with  medical  disease  are 
excessive bleeding for patients taking anticoagulants, infection of the 
heart valves and prosthetic devices from hematogenous seeding by the 
oral flora, and cardiovascular complications resulting from vasopres-
sors  used  with  local  anesthetics  during  dental  treatment.  Experience 
confirms that the risk of any of these complications is very low.

Patients  undergoing  tooth  extraction  or  alveolar  and  gingival 
surgery  rarely  experience  uncontrolled  bleeding  when  warfarin  anti-
coagulation  is  maintained  within  the  therapeutic  range  currently 
recommended for prevention of venous thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, 
or mechanical heart valve. Embolic complications and death, however, 
have been reported during subtherapeutic anticoagulation. Therapeu-
tic anticoagulation should be confirmed before and continued through 
the procedure. Likewise, low-dose aspirin (e.g., 81–325 mg) can safely 
be  continued.  For  patients  taking  aspirin  and  another  antiplatelet 
medication  (e.g.,  clopidogrel),  the  decision  to  continue  the  second 
antiplatelet  medication  should  be  based  on  individual  consideration 
of the risks of thrombosis and bleeding. The newer target-specific oral 
anticoagulants (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) are 
in increasingly common use. Simple extractions of one to three teeth, 
periodontal surgery, abscess drainage, and implant positioning do not 
typically require interruption of therapy. More extensive surgery may 
necessitate  delaying  or  holding  a  dose  of  the  anticoagulant  or  more 
elaborate measures to manage the risk of thrombosis and bleeding.

Patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis (Chap. 128) should main-
tain optimal oral hygiene, including flossing, and have regular profes-
sional  cleanings.  Currently,  guidelines  recommend  that  prophylactic 
antibiotics be restricted to those patients at high risk for bacterial endo-
carditis who undergo dental and oral procedures involving significant 
manipulation of gingival or periapical tissue or penetration of the oral 
mucosa.  If  unexpected  bleeding  occurs,  antibiotics  given  within  2  h 
after the procedure provide effective prophylaxis.

Hematogenous bacterial seeding from oral infection can undoubt-
edly  produce  late  prosthetic-joint  infection  and  therefore  requires 
removal  of  the  infected  tissue  (e.g.,  drainage,  extraction,  root  canal) 
and  appropriate  antibiotic  therapy.  However,  evidence  that  late  
prosthetic-joint infection follows routine dental procedures is lacking. 
For this reason, antibiotic prophylaxis is generally not recommended 
before  oral  surgery  or  oral  mucosal  manipulation  for  patients  who 
have  undergone  joint  replacement  surgery.  Exceptions  to  this  may 
be  considered  for  patients  who  have  experienced  joint  replacement 
complications.

Concern  often  arises  regarding  the  use  of  vasoconstrictors  to 
treat  patients  with  hypertension  and  heart  disease.  Vasoconstrictors 
enhance  the  depth  and  duration  of  local  anesthesia,  thus  reducing 
the anesthetic dose and potential toxicity. If intravascular injection is 
avoided,  2%  lidocaine  with  1:100,000  epinephrine  (limited  to  a  total 
of 0.036 mg of epinephrine) can be used safely in patients with con-
trolled  hypertension  and  stable  coronary  heart  disease,  arrhythmia, 

or congestive heart failure. Precautions should be taken with patients 
taking tricyclic antidepressants and nonselective beta blockers because 
these drugs may potentiate the effect of epinephrine.

Elective dental treatments should be postponed for at least 1 month 
and preferably for 6 months after myocardial infarction, after which the 
risk of reinfarction is low provided the patient is medically stable (e.g., 
stable rhythm, stable angina, and no heart failure). Patients who have 
suffered a stroke should have elective dental care deferred for 9 months. 
In both situations, effective stress reduction requires good pain control, 
including the use of the minimal amount of vasoconstrictor necessary 
to provide good hemostasis and local anesthesia.

Bisphosphonate therapy is associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
However, the risk with oral bisphosphonate therapy is very low. Most 
patients affected have received high-dose aminobisphosphonate ther-
apy for multiple myeloma or metastatic breast cancer and have under-
gone  tooth  extraction  or  dental  surgery.  Intraoral  lesions,  of  which 
two-thirds  are  painful,  appear  as  exposed  yellow-white  hard  bone 
involving  the  mandible  or  maxilla.  Screening  tests  for  determining 
risk of osteonecrosis are unreliable. Patients slated for aminobisphos-
phonate therapy should receive preventive dental care that reduces the 
risk of infection and the need for future dentoalveolar surgery.

Halitosis  Halitosis typically emanates from the oral cavity or nasal 
passages. Volatile sulfur compounds resulting from bacterial decay of 
food and cellular debris account for the malodor. Periodontal disease, 
caries,  acute  forms  of  gingivitis,  poorly  fitting  dentures,  oral  abscess, 
and tongue coating are common causes. Treatment includes correcting 
poor hygiene, treating infection, and tongue brushing. Hyposalivation 
can produce and exacerbate halitosis. Pockets of decay in the tonsillar 
crypts, esophageal diverticulum, esophageal stasis (e.g., achalasia, stric-
ture), sinusitis, and lung abscess account for some instances. A few sys-
temic diseases produce distinctive odors: renal failure (ammoniacal), 
hepatic  (fishy),  and  ketoacidosis  (fruity).  Helicobacter  pylori  gastritis 
can also produce ammoniacal breath. If a patient presents because of 
concern about halitosis but no odor is detectable, then pseudohalitosis 
or halitophobia must be considered.

Aging and Oral Health  While  tooth  loss  and  dental  disease  are 
not normal consequences of aging, a complex array of structural and 
functional  changes  that  occur  with  age  can  affect  oral  health.  Subtle 
changes  in  tooth  structure  (e.g.,  diminished  pulp  space  and  volume, 
sclerosis  of  dentinal  tubules,  and  altered  proportions  of  nerve  and 
vascular pulp content) result in the elimination or diminution of pain 
sensitivity  and  a  reduction  in  the  reparative  capacity  of  the  teeth.  In 
addition, age-associated fatty replacement of salivary acini may reduce 
physiologic  reserve,  thus  increasing  the  risk  of  hyposalivation.  In 
healthy older adults, there is minimal, if any, reduction in salivary flow.
Poor  oral  hygiene  often  results  when  general  health  fails  or  when 
patients  lose  manual  dexterity  and  upper-extremity  flexibility.  This 
situation is particularly common among frail older adults and nursing 
home residents and must be emphasized because regular oral cleaning 
and  dental  care  reduce  the  incidence  of  pneumonia  and  oral  disease 
as well as the mortality risk in this population. Other risks for dental 
decay  include  limited  lifetime  fluoride  exposure.  Without  assiduous 
care,  decay  can  become  quite  advanced  yet  remain  asymptomatic. 
Consequently, much of a tooth—or the entire tooth—can be destroyed 
before the patient is aware of the process.

Periodontal  disease,  a  leading  cause  of  tooth  loss,  is  indicated  by 
loss of alveolar bone height. More than 90% of the U.S. population has 
some degree of periodontal disease by age 50. Healthy adults who have 
not had significant alveolar bone loss by the sixth decade of life do not 
typically experience significant worsening with advancing age.

With  the  passing  of  those  born  in  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth 
century,  complete  edentulousness  in  the  United  States  is  becoming 
increasingly restricted to impoverished populations. When it is pres-
ent, speech, mastication, and facial contours are dramatically affected. 
Edentulousness  may  also  exacerbate  obstructive  sleep  apnea,  partic-
ularly in asymptomatic individuals who wear dentures. Dentures can

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesimprove  verbal  articulation  and  restore  diminished  facial  contours. 
Mastication can also be restored; however, patients expecting dentures 
to  facilitate  oral  intake  are  often  disappointed.  Accommodation  to 
dentures requires a period of adjustment. Pain can result from friction 
or  traumatic  lesions  produced  by  loose  dentures.  Poor  fit  and  poor 
oral hygiene may permit the development of candidiasis. This fungal 
infection may be either asymptomatic or painful and is suggested by 
erythematous smooth or granular tissue conforming to an area covered 
by the appliance. Individuals with dentures and no natural teeth need 
regular (annual) professional oral examinations.

37 Dyspnea

Rebecca M. Baron

DYSPNEA
 ■ DEFINITION
The American Thoracic Society consensus statement defines dyspnea 
as  a  “subjective  experience  of  breathing  discomfort  that  consists  of 
qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity. The experience 
derives  from  interactions  among  multiple  physiological,  psycholog-
ical,  social,  and  environmental  factors  and  may  induce  secondary 
physiological and behavioral responses.” Dyspnea, a symptom, can be 
perceived  only  by  the  person  experiencing  it  and,  therefore,  must  be 
self-reported.  In  contrast,  signs  of  increased  work  of  breathing,  such 
as tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and intercostal retraction, can be 
measured and reported by clinicians.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Dyspnea is common. It has been reported that up to one-half of inpa-
tients and one-quarter of ambulatory patients experience dyspnea, with 
a prevalence of 9–13% in the community that increases to as high as 
37% for adults aged ≥70 years. Dyspnea is a frequent cause for emer-
gency room visits, accounting for as many as 3–4 million visits per year. 
Furthermore, it is increasingly appreciated that the degree of dyspnea 
may better predict outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD)  than  does  the  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  s  (FEV1),  and 
formal  measures  of  dyspnea  have  been  incorporated  into  the  Global 
Initiative  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease  (GOLD)  COPD 
severity  assessment  guidelines.  Dyspnea  may  also  predict  outcomes 
in  other  chronic  heart  and  lung  diseases  as  well.  Dyspnea  can  arise 
from a diverse array of pulmonary, cardiac, and neurologic underlying 
causes,  and  elucidation  of  particular  symptoms  may  point  toward  a 
specific  etiology  and/or  mechanism  driving  dyspnea  (although  addi-
tional diagnostic testing is often required, as will be further discussed  
below).

 ■ MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DYSPNEA
The  mechanisms  underlying  dyspnea  are  complex,  as  it  can  arise 
from  different  contributory  respiratory  sensations.  Although  a  large 
body  of  research  has  increased  our  understanding  of  mechanisms 
underlying  particular  respiratory  sensations  such  as  “chest  tightness” 
or  “air  hunger,”  it  is  likely  that  a  given  disease  state  might  produce 
the  sensation  of  dyspnea  via  more  than  one  underlying  mechanism. 
Dyspnea  can  arise  from  a  variety  of  pathways,  including  generation 
of afferent signals from the respiratory system to the central nervous 
system (CNS), efferent signals from the CNS to the respiratory muscles, 
and particularly when there is a mismatch in the integrative signaling 
between  these  two  pathways,  termed  efferent-reafferent  mismatch  
(Fig. 37-1).

Afferent  signals  trigger  the  CNS  (brainstem  and/or  cortex)  and 
include primarily: (1) peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid body 
and  aortic  arch  and  central  chemoreceptors  in  the  medulla  that  are 
activated by hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or acidemia, and might produce 
a sense of “air hunger”; and (2) mechanoreceptors in the upper airways, 
lungs (including stretch receptors, irritant receptors, and J receptors), 
and  chest  wall  (including  muscle  spindles  as  stretch  receptors  and 
tendon organs that monitor force generation) that are activated in the 
setting  of  an  increased  work  load  from  a  disease  state  producing  an 
increase in airway resistance that may be associated with symptoms of 
chest tightness (e.g., asthma or COPD) or decreased lung or chest wall 
compliance (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis). Other afferent signals that trig-
ger dyspnea within the respiratory system can arise from pulmonary 
vascular receptor responses to changes in pulmonary artery pressure 
and  skeletal  muscle  (termed  metaboreceptors)  that  are  believed  to 
sense changes in the biochemical environment.

Efferent signals are sent from the CNS (motor cortex and brainstem) 
to  the  respiratory  muscles  and  are  also  transmitted  by  corollary  dis-
charge to the sensory cortex; they are believed to underlie sensations 
of respiratory effort (or “work of breathing”) and perhaps contribute 
to  sensations  of  “air  hunger,”  especially  in  response  to  an  increased 
ventilatory load in a disease state such as COPD. In addition, fear or 
anxiety may heighten the sense of dyspnea by exacerbating the under-
lying physiologic disturbance in response to an increased respiratory 
rate or disordered breathing pattern.

 ■ ASSESSING DYSPNEA
While it is well appreciated that dyspnea is a difficult quality to reliably 
measure due to multiple relevant possible domains that can be measured 
(e.g.,  sensory-perceptual  experience,  affective  distress,  and  symptom 
impact  or  burden),  and  there  exist  no  uniformly  agreed  upon  tools 
for  dyspnea  assessment,  consensus  opinion  is  that  dyspnea  should  be 
formally assessed in a context most relevant and beneficial for patient 
management  and,  furthermore,  that  the  specific  domains  being  mea-
sured are adequately described. There are a number of emerging tools 
that have been developed for formal dyspnea assessment. As an exam-
ple, the GOLD criteria advocate use of a dyspnea assessment tool such 
as the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (Table 37-1) 
to assess symptom/impact burden in COPD.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
This chapter focuses largely on chronic dyspnea, which is defined as 
symptoms  lasting  longer  than  1  month  and  can  arise  from  a  broad 
array of different underlying conditions, most commonly attributable 
to pulmonary or cardiac conditions that account for as many as 85% 
of the underlying causes of dyspnea. However, as many as one-third of 
patients  may  have  multifactorial  reasons  underlying  dyspnea.  Exam-
ples of a wide array of conditions that underlie dyspnea with possible 
mechanisms  underlying  the  presenting  symptoms  are  described  in 
Table 37-2.

Respiratory  system  causes  include  diseases  of  the  airways  (e.g., 
asthma  and  COPD),  diseases  of  the  parenchyma  (more  commonly, 
interstitial  lung  diseases  are  seen  in  the  setting  of  chronic  dyspnea, 
but  alveolar  filling  processes,  such  as  hypersensitivity  pneumonitis 
or  bronchiolitis  obliterans  organizing  pneumonia  [BOOP],  can  also

FIGURE 37-1  Signaling pathways underlying dyspnea. Dyspnea arises from a range of sensory inputs, many of which lead to distinct descriptive phrases used by patients 
(shown in italics in the figure). The sensation of respiratory effort (or work of breathing) likely arises from signals transmitted from the motor cortex to the sensory cortex 
when outgoing motor commands are sent to the respiratory muscles. Motor output from the brain stem may also be accompanied by signals transmitted to the sensory 
cortex and contribute to the sensation of work of breathing. The sensation of air hunger likely derives from stimuli that increase the drive to breathe (e.g., hypoxemia, 
hypercapnia, acidemia; mediated by signals from central and peripheral chemoreceptors), as well as airway and interstitial inflammation (mediated by pulmonary afferent 
signals) and pulmonary vascular receptors. Dyspnea arises, in part, from a perceived mismatch between the outgoing efferent messages to the respiratory muscles and 
incoming afferent signals from the lungs and chest wall. Chest tightness, often associated with bronchospasm, is largely mediated by simulation of vagal-irritant receptors.  
Afferent signals from airway, lung, and chest wall mechanoreceptors most likely pass through the brain stem before being transmitted to the sensory cortex, although it is 
possible that some afferent information bypasses the brain stem and goes directly to the sensory cortex. (Adapted from RM Schwartzstein: Approach to the patient with

arise  from  a  variety  of  underlying  causes,  or  chronic  thromboemolic 
disease). Diseases affecting the cardiovascular system that can present 
with  dyspnea  include  processes  affecting  left  heart  function,  such  as 
coronary  artery  disease  and  cardiomyopathy,  as  well  as  disease  pro-
cesses  affecting  the  pericardium,  including  constrictive  pericarditis 
and  cardiac  tamponade.  Other  conditions  underyling  dyspnea  that 
might  not  directly  emanate  from  the  pulmonary  or  cardiovascular 
systems include anemia (thereby potentially affecting oxygen-carrying 
capacity), deconditioning, and psychological processes such as anxiety. 
Distinguishing between the myriad of underlying processes that might 
present with dyspnea can be challenging. A graded approach that begins 
with a history and physical examination, followed by selected laboratory 
testing that might then advance to additional diagnostics and potentially 
subspecialty referral, may help elucidate the underlying cause of dysp-
nea. However, a substantial proportion of patients may have persistent 
dyspnea despite treatment for an underlying process or may not have a 
specific underlying process identified that is driving the dyspnea.

aDifferential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease includes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, collagen vascular disease, drug- or occupation-induced pneumonitis, lymphangitic 
spread of malignancy; processes that are more alveolar rather than interstitial in nature can also less commonly contribute to parenchymal lung disease underlying chronic 
dyspnea and include entities such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, etc. bWould additionally consider these patients for CT 
angiography to evaluate for presence of thromboemboli, ventilation/perfusion scanning to evaluate for the presence of chronic thromboembolic disease, and right heart 
catheterization to further evaluate for pulmonary hypertension. cDiastolic dysfunction in the setting of a stiff left ventricle is often seen and contributes significantly to 
insidious dyspnea that can be difficult to treat. dMay stimulate metaboreceptors if cardiac output is sufficiently reduced to result in a lactic acidosis.

evaluation  will  usually  address  determining  whether  the  known 
condition  has  progressed  or  whether  a  new  process  has  devel-
oped that is causing dyspnea. For patients without a prior known 
potential  cause  of  dyspnea,  the  initial  evaluation  will  focus  on 
determining  an  underlying  etiology.  Determining  the  underlying 
cause, if possible, is extremely important, as the treatment may vary 
dramatically based on the predisposing condition. An initial history 
and  physical  examination  remain  fundamental  to  the  evaluation 
followed by initial diagnostic testing as indicated that might prompt 
subspecialty referral (e.g., pulmonary, cardiology, neurology, sleep, 
and/or specialized dyspnea clinic) if the cause of dyspnea remains 
elusive (Fig. 37-2). As many as two-thirds of patients will require 
diagnostic testing beyond the initial clinical presentation. 

HISTORY
The  patient  should  be  asked  to  describe  in  his  or  her  own  words 
what  the  discomfort  feels  like  as  well  as  the  effect  of  position, 

infections, and environmental stimuli on the dyspnea, as descrip-
tors  may  be  helpful  in  pointing  toward  an  etiology.  For  example, 
symptoms of chest tightness might suggest the possibility of bron-
choconstriction, and the sensation of inability to take a deep breath 
may correlate with dynamic hyperinflation from COPD. Orthopnea 
is a common indicator of congestive heart failure (CHF), mechani-
cal impairment of the diaphragm associated with obesity, or asthma 
triggered by esophageal reflux. Nocturnal dyspnea suggests CHF or 
asthma. Acute, intermittent episodes of dyspnea are more likely to 
reflect episodes of myocardial ischemia, bronchospasm, or pulmo-
nary embolism, while chronic persistent dyspnea is more typical of 
COPD, interstitial lung disease, and chronic thromboembolic dis-
ease. Information on risk factors for drug-induced or occupational 
lung disease and for coronary artery disease should be elicited. Left 
atrial  myxoma  or  hepatopulmonary  syndrome  should  be  consid-
ered when the patient complains of platypnea—i.e., dyspnea in the 
upright position with relief in the supine position.

As  described  in  the  text,  the  approach  should  begin  with  a  detailed  history  and

testing and subspecialty referral as is indicated to determine the underlying cause 
of dyspnea. CBC, complete blood count; DLCO, diffusing capacity of the lungs for

Physician 71:1529, 2005.)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Initial vital signs might be helpful in pointing toward an underly-
ing etiology in the context of the remainder of the evaluation. For 
example,  the  presence  of  fever  might  point  toward  an  underlying 
infectious or inflammatory process; the presence of hypertension in 
the setting of a heart failure might point toward diastolic dysfunc-
tion;  the  presence  of  tachycardia  might  be  associated  with  many 
different  underlying  processes  including  fever,  cardiac  dysfunc-
tion,  and  deconditioning;  and  the  presence  of  resting  hypoxemia 
suggests  processes  involving  hypercapnia,  ventilation-perfusion 
mismatch,  shunt,  or  impairment  in  diffusion  capacity  might  be 
involved. An exertional oxygen saturation should also be obtained 
as described below. The physical examination should begin during 
the interview of the patient. Inability of the patient to speak in full 
sentences before stopping to get a deep breath suggests a condition 
that  leads  to  stimulation  of  the  controller  or  impairment  of  the 
ventilatory pump with reduced vital capacity. Evidence of increased 
work  of  breathing  (supraclavicular  retractions;  use  of  accessory 
muscles  of  ventilation;  and  the  tripod  position,  characterized  by 
sitting with the hands braced on the knees) is indicative of increased 
airway resistance or stiffness of the lungs and the chest wall. When 
measuring the vital signs, the physician should accurately assess the 
respiratory rate and measure the pulsus paradoxus (Chap. 270); if 
the  systolic  pressure  decreases  by  >10  mmHg  on  inspiration,  the 

presence of COPD, acute asthma, or pericardial disease should be 
considered. During the general examination, signs of anemia (pale 
conjunctivae),  cyanosis,  and  cirrhosis  (spider  angiomata,  gyneco-
mastia)  should  be  sought.  Examination  of  the  chest  should  focus 
on  symmetry  of  movement;  percussion  (dullness  is  indicative  of 
pleural  effusion;  hyperresonance  is  a  sign  of  pneumothorax  and 
emphysema); and auscultation (wheezes, rhonchi, prolonged expi-
ratory phase, and diminished breath sounds are clues to disorders of 
the airways; rales suggest interstitial edema or fibrosis). The cardiac 
examination should focus on signs of elevated right heart pressures 
(jugular venous distention, edema, accentuated pulmonic compo-
nent  to  the  second  heart  sound);  left  ventricular  dysfunction  (S3 
and S4 gallops); and valvular disease (murmurs). When examining 
the abdomen with the patient in the supine position, the physician 
should  note  whether  there  is  paradoxical  movement  of  the  abdo-
men as well as the presence of increased respiratory distress in the 
supine position: inward motion during inspiration is a sign of dia-
phragmatic weakness, and rounding of the abdomen during exha-
lation is suggestive of pulmonary edema. Clubbing of the digits may 
be an indication of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or bronchiectasis, 
and joint swelling or deformation as well as changes consistent with 
Raynaud’s disease may be indicative of a collagen-vascular process 
that can be associated with pulmonary disease.

Patients should be asked to walk under observation with oxim-
etry  in  order  to  reproduce  the  symptoms.  The  patient  should  be 
examined during and at the end of exercise for new findings that 
were not present at rest (e.g., presence of wheezing) and for changes 
in oxygen saturation. 

CHEST IMAGING
After the history elicitation and the physical examination, a chest 
radiograph  should  be  obtained  if  the  diagnosis  remains  elusive. 
The lung volumes should be assessed: hyperinflation is consistent 
with  obstructive  lung  disease,  whereas  low  lung  volumes  sug-
gest  interstitial  edema  or  fibrosis,  diaphragmatic  dysfunction,  or 
impaired  chest  wall  motion.  The  pulmonary  parenchyma  should 
be  examined  for  evidence  of  interstitial  disease,  infiltrates,  and 
emphysema. Prominent pulmonary vasculature in the upper zones 
indicates pulmonary venous hypertension, while enlarged central 
pulmonary arteries may suggest pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
An enlarged cardiac silhouette can point toward dilated cardiomy-
opathy  or  valvular  disease.  Bilateral  pleural  effusions  are  typical 
of  CHF  and  some  forms  of  collagen-vascular  disease.  Unilateral 
effusions raise the specter of carcinoma and pulmonary embolism 
but may also occur in heart failure or in the case of a parapneu-
monic  effusion.  CT  of  the  chest  is  generally  reserved  for  fur-
ther evaluation of the lung parenchyma (interstitial lung disease) 
and  possible  pulmonary  embolism  if  there  remains  diagnostic   
uncertainty. 

LABORATORY STUDIES
Initial  laboratory  testing  should  include  a  hematocrit  to  exclude 
occult anemia as an underlying cause of reduced oxygen-carrying 
capacity contributing to dyspnea, and a basic metabolic panel may 
be  helpful  to  exclude  a  significant  underlying  metabolic  acidosis 
(and  conversely,  an  elevated  bicarbonate  might  point  toward  the 
possibility of carbon dioxide retention that might be seen in chronic 
respiratory failure—in such a setting, an arterial blood gas may pro-
vide useful additional information). Additional laboratory studies 
should  include  electrocardiography  to  seek  evidence  of  ventricu-
lar  hypertrophy  and  prior  myocardial  infarction  and  spirometry, 
which can be diagnostic of the presence of an obstructive ventila-
tory  defect  and  suggest  the  possibility  of  a  restrictive  ventilatory 
defect  (that  then  might  prompt  additional  pulmonary  function 
laboratory testing, including lung volumes, diffusion capacity, and 
possible  tests  of  neuromuscular  function).  Echocardiography  is 
indicated  when  systolic  dysfunction,  pulmonary  hypertension,  or 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   266

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesvalvular  heart  disease  is  suspected.  Bronchoprovocation  testing 
and/or home peak-flow monitoring may be useful in patients with 
intermittent  symptoms  suggestive  of  asthma  who  have  a  normal 
physical  examination  and  spirometry;  up  to  one-third  of  patients 
with the clinical diagnosis of asthma do not have reactive airways 
disease  when  formally  tested.  Measurement  of  brain  natriuretic 
peptide  levels  in  serum  is  increasingly  used  to  assess  for  CHF  in 
patients presenting with acute dyspnea but may be elevated in the 
presence of right ventricular strain as well. 

DISTINGUISHING CARDIOVASCULAR FROM RESPIRATORY 
SYSTEM DYSPNEA
If a patient has evidence of both pulmonary and cardiac disease that 
is  not  responsive  to  treatment  or  it  remains  unclear  what  factors 
are primarily driving the dyspnea, a cardiopulmonary exercise test 
(CPET) can be carried out to determine which system is responsible 
for  the  exercise  limitation.  CPET  includes  incremental  symptom- 
limited exercise (cycling or treadmill) with measurements of ven-
tilation and pulmonary gas exchange and, in some cases, includes 
noninvasive and invasive measures of pulmonary vascular pressures 
and  cardiac  output.  If,  at  peak  exercise,  the  patient  achieves  pre-
dicted maximal ventilation, demonstrates an increase in dead space 
or  hypoxemia,  or  develops  bronchospasm,  the  respiratory  system 
may be the cause of the problem. Alternatively, if the heart rate is 
>85%  of  the  predicted  maximum,  if  the  anaerobic  threshold  occurs 
early, if the blood pressure becomes excessively high or decreases dur-
ing exercise, if the O2 pulse (O2 consumption/heart rate, an indicator 
of stroke volume) falls, or if there are ischemic changes on the electro-
cardiogram, an abnormality of the cardiovascular system is likely the 
explanation for the breathing discomfort. Additionally, a CPET may 
also  help  point  toward  a  peripheral  extraction  deficit  or  metabolic/ 
neuromuscular  disease  as  potential  underlying  processes  driving 
dyspnea.

TREATMENT
Dyspnea
The  first  goal  is  to  correct  the  underlying  condition(s)  driving 
dyspnea and address potentially reversible causes with appropriate 
treatment  for  the  particular  condition.  Multiple  different  inter-
ventions  may  be  necessary,  given  that  dyspnea  often  arises  from 
multifactorial  causes.  If  relief  of  dyspnea  with  treatment  of  the 
underlying  condition(s)  is  not  fully  possible,  an  effort  is  made  to 
lessen  the  intensity  of  the  symptom  and  its  effect  on  the  patient’s 
quality of life. More recent work at the consensus conference level 
has  sought  to  define  an  identifiable  entity  of  persistent  dyspnea 
in  order  to  develop  an  approach  to  improving  efforts  to  address 
symptom management for this condition. In 2017, an international 
group of experts defined “chronic breathlessness syndrome” as “the 
experience of breathlessness that persists despite optimal treatment 
of the underlying pathophysiology and results in disability for the 
patient.”  Despite  an  increased  understanding  of  the  mechanisms 
underlying  dyspnea,  there  has  been  limited  progress  in  treatment 
strategies for dyspnea. Supplemental O2 should be administered if 
the resting O2 saturation is ≤88% or if the patient’s saturation drops 
to these levels with activity or sleep. In particular, for patients with 
COPD,  supplemental  oxygen  for  those  with  hypoxemia  has  been 
shown  to  improve  mortality,  and  pulmonary  rehabilitation  pro-
grams (including some community-based exercise programs such 
as yoga and Tai Chi) have demonstrated positive effects on dyspnea, 
exercise  capacity,  and  rates  of  hospitalization.  Opioids  have  been 
shown  to  reduce  symptoms  of  dyspnea,  largely  through  reducing 
air hunger, thus likely suppressing respiratory drive and influencing 
cortical  activity.  However,  opioids  should  be  considered  for  each 
patient individually based on the risk-benefit profile in regard to the 
effects of respiratory depression. Studies of anxiolytics for dyspnea 

have  not  demonstrated  consistent  benefit.  Additional  approaches 
are  under  study  for  dyspnea,  including  inhaled  furosemide  that 
might alter afferent sensory information.

38 Cough

Christopher H. Fanta

COUGH
Cough  performs  an  essential  protective  function  for  human  airways 
and lungs. Without an effective cough reflex, we are at risk for retained 
airway  secretions  and  aspirated  material  predisposing  to  infection, 
atelectasis, and respiratory compromise. At the other extreme, exces-
sive coughing can be exhausting; can be complicated by emesis, syn-
cope,  muscular  pain,  or  rib  fractures;  can  aggravate  low  back  pain, 
abdominal  or  inguinal  hernias,  and  urinary  incontinence;  and  can 
be  a  major  impediment  to  social  interactions.  Cough  is  often  a  clue 
to the presence of respiratory disease. In many instances, cough is an 
expected and accepted manifestation of disease, as in acute respiratory 
tract infection. However, persistent cough in the absence of other respi-
ratory symptoms commonly causes patients to seek medical attention.
 ■ COUGH MECHANISM
Both  chemical  (e.g.,  capsaicin)  and  mechanical  (e.g.,  mucus,  partic-
ulates in air pollution) stimuli can initiate the cough reflex. Cationic 
channels  (e.g.,  transient  receptor  potential  channels)  and  adenosine  
triphosphate–activated ion channels (P2X3) function as sensory neu-
ronal  receptors,  with  signals  transmitted  centrally  via  Aδ  (mecha-
nosensory) and C fibers (chemosensory). Afferent nerve endings richly 
innervate the pharynx, larynx, and airways to the level of the terminal 
bronchioles and extend into the lung parenchyma. They are also located 
in the external auditory canal (the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, 
or Arnold’s nerve) and in the esophagus. Sensory signals travel via the 
vagus  and  superior  laryngeal  nerves  to  a  region  of  the  brainstem  in 
the nucleus tractus solitarius. Integrated neural networks process this 
input into a conscious sensation referred to as the “urge to cough.” The

cords adduct, leading to transient upper-airway occlusion. Expiratory 
muscles contract, generating positive intrathoracic pressures as high as  
300  mmHg.  With  sudden  release  of  the  laryngeal  contraction,  rapid 
expiratory  flows  are  generated,  exceeding  the  normal  “envelope”  of 
maximal  expiratory  flow  seen  on  the  flow-volume  curve  (Fig.  38-1). 
Bronchial  smooth-muscle  contraction  together  with  dynamic  com-
pression of airways narrows airway lumens and maximizes the velocity 
of exhalation. The kinetic energy available to dislodge mucus from the 
inside of airway walls is directly proportional to the square of the veloc-
ity of expiratory airflow. A deep breath preceding a cough optimizes 
the function of the expiratory muscles; a series of repetitive coughs at 
successively lower lung volumes sweeps the point of maximal expira-
tory velocity progressively further into the lung periphery.
 ■ IMPAIRED COUGH
Weak or ineffective cough compromises the ability to clear lower respi-
ratory  tract  secretions,  predisposing  to  more  serious  infections  and 
their sequelae. Weakness or paralysis of the expiratory (abdominal and 
intercostal) muscles and pain in the chest wall or abdomen are foremost 
on the list of causes of impaired cough (Table 38-1). Cough strength 
is  generally  assessed  qualitatively;  peak  expiratory  flow  or  maximal 
expiratory  pressure  at  the  mouth  can  be  used  as  a  surrogate  marker 
for cough strength. A variety of assistive devices and techniques have 
been  developed  to  improve  cough  efficacy,  running  the  gamut  from 
simple (splinting of the abdominal muscles with a tightly held pillow to 
reduce postoperative pain while coughing) to complex (a mechanical 
cough-assist device supplied via face mask or tracheal tube that applies 
a  cycle  of  positive  pressure  followed  rapidly  by  negative  pressure). 
Cough may fail to clear secretions completely despite a preserved abil-
ity  to  generate  normal  expiratory  velocities;  such  failure  may  be  due 
to  abnormal  airway  secretions  (e.g.,  abnormally  viscous  secretions  of 
cystic  fibrosis),  ciliary  dysfunction  (e.g.,  primary  ciliary  dyskinesia), 
or  structural  abnormalities  of  the  airways  (e.g.,  tracheomalacia  with 
excessive expiratory collapse of the trachea during cough).

 ■ SYMPTOMATIC COUGH
Cough  may  occur  in  the  context  of  other  respiratory  symptoms  that 
together  point  to  a  diagnosis;  for  example,  cough  accompanied  by 
wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness after exposure to a 
cat or other sources of allergens suggests asthma. At times, however, 
cough is the dominant or sole symptom of disease, and it may be of 
sufficient  duration  and  severity  that  relief  is  sought.  The  duration  of 
cough  is  a  clue  to  its  etiology,  at  least  retrospectively.  Acute  cough  
(<3  weeks)  is  most  commonly  due  to  a  respiratory  tract  infection, 
aspiration,  or  inhalation  of  noxious  chemicals  or  smoke.  Subacute 
cough (3–8 weeks in duration) is a common residuum of tracheobro-
nchitis, as in pertussis or “postviral tussive syndrome.” Chronic cough  
(>8 weeks) may be caused by a wide variety of cardiopulmonary dis-
eases, including those of inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and car-
diovascular etiologies. When initial assessment with chest examination 
and  radiography  is  normal,  cough-variant  asthma,  gastroesophageal 
reflux,  rhinosinusitis  with  excessive  nasopharyngeal  drainage,  and 
medications  (angiotensin-converting  enzyme  [ACE]  inhibitors)  are 
the most common identifiable causes of chronic cough. In a long-time 
cigarette smoker, an early-morning, productive cough suggests chronic 
bronchitis. A dry, irritative cough that lingers for >2 months following 
one or more respiratory tract infections (“postbronchitic cough”) is a 
very common cause of chronic cough, especially in the winter months. 
Chronic cough in the absence of identifiable etiology has been recog-
nized with increasing frequency, is thought to be due to exaggerated 
neurologic signaling via sensory cough-reflex pathways, and is referred 
to as “chronic cough hypersensitivity syndrome.”

 ■ ASSESSMENT OF CHRONIC COUGH
Except for our ability to detect the sound of excess airway secretions, 
details as to the resonance of the cough, its time of occurrence during 
the  day,  and  the  pattern  of  coughing  (e.g.,  occurring  in  paroxysms) 
infrequently provide useful etiologic clues. Regardless of cause, cough 
often worsens upon first lying down at night, with talking, or with the 
hyperpnea of exercise; it frequently improves with sleep. An exception 
may involve the cough that occurs only with certain allergic exposures 
or exercise in cold air, as in asthma. Useful historical questions include 
what  circumstances  surrounded  the  onset  of  cough,  what  makes  the 
cough better or worse, and whether the cough produces sputum.

The  physical  examination  seeks  clues  suggesting  the  presence  of 
cardiopulmonary  disease,  including  findings  such  as  wheezing  or 
crackles on chest examination. Examination of the auditory canals and 
tympanic membranes (for irritation of the latter resulting in stimula-
tion of Arnold’s nerve), the nasal passageways (for rhinitis or polyps), 
and the nails (for clubbing) may also provide etiologic clues. Because 
cough can be a manifestation of a systemic disease such as sarcoidosis 
or vasculitis, a thorough general examination is likewise important.

In virtually all instances, evaluation of chronic cough merits a chest 
radiograph. The list of diseases that can cause persistent cough without 
other  symptoms  and  without  detectable  abnormalities  on  physical 
examination is long. It includes serious illnesses such as sarcoidosis or 
Hodgkin’s disease in young adults, lung cancer in older patients, and 
(worldwide) pulmonary tuberculosis. An abnormal chest film prompts 
an evaluation aimed at explaining the radiographic abnormality. In a 
patient  with  chronic  productive  cough,  examination  of  expectorated 
sputum is warranted, because determining the cause of mucus hyperse-
cretion is a crucial clue to etiology. Purulent-appearing sputum should 
be  sent  for  routine  bacterial  culture  and,  in  certain  circumstances, 
mycobacterial  culture  as  well.  Cytologic  examination  of  mucoid 
sputum  may  be  useful  to  assess  for  malignancy  and  oropharyngeal 
aspiration and to distinguish neutrophilic from eosinophilic bronchi-
tis.  Expectoration  of  blood—whether  streaks  of  blood,  blood  mixed 
with airway secretions, or pure blood—deserves a special approach to 
assessment and management (Chap. 39).

 ■ CHRONIC COUGH WITH A NORMAL CHEST 
RADIOGRAPH
It is commonly held that (alone or in combination) the use of an ACE 
inhibitor;  postnasal  drainage;  gastroesophageal  reflux;  and  asthma

account for >90% of cases of chronic cough with a normal or noncon-
tributory chest radiograph. However, clinical experience does not sup-
port this contention, and strict adherence to this concept discourages 
the search for alternative explanations by both clinicians and research-
ers.  In  recent  years,  the  concept  of  a  distinct  “cough  hypersensitivity 
syndrome”  has  emerged,  emphasizing  the  putative  role  of  sensitized 
sensory nerve endings and afferent neural pathways in causing chronic 
refractory  cough,  akin  to  chronic  neuropathic  pain.  It  presents  with 
a  dry  or  minimally  productive  cough  and  a  tickle  or  sensitivity  in 
the throat, made worse with talking, laughing, or exertion. It is more 
common in women than men and can last for years. Specific diagnostic 
criteria are lacking; the diagnosis is suspected when alternative etiol-
ogies are excluded by diagnostic testing or failed therapeutic trials. It 
is uncertain whether persistent daily coughing elicits an inflammatory 
response and is thereby self-perpetuating.

ACE  inhibitor–induced  cough  occurs  in  5–30%  of  patients  taking 
these agents and is not dose-dependent. ACE metabolizes bradykinin 
and  other  tachykinins,  such  as  substance  P.  The  mechanism  of  ACE 
inhibitor–associated cough may involve sensitization of sensory nerve 
endings due to accumulation of bradykinin. Any patient with chronic 
unexplained  cough  who  is  taking  an  ACE  inhibitor  should  have  a 
trial  period  off  the  medication,  regardless  of  the  timing  of  the  onset 
of  cough  relative  to  the  initiation  of  ACE  inhibitor  therapy.  In  most 
instances,  a  safe  alternative  is  available;  angiotensin  receptor  block-
ers  do  not  cause  cough.  Failure  to  observe  a  decrease  in  cough  after  
1 month off medication argues strongly against this etiology.

Postnasal  drainage  of  any  etiology  can  cause  cough  as  a  response 
to  stimulation  of  sensory  receptors  of  the  cough-reflex  pathway  in  the 
hypopharynx  or  aspiration  of  draining  secretions  into  the  trachea. 
The  term  upper  airway  cough  syndrome  has  been  coined  to  encompass  
the concept that chronic inflammation in the nose and sinuses can cause 
cough even in the absence of physical drainage into the pharynx. His-
torical clues suggesting this etiology include a sensation of postnasal 
drip, frequent throat clearing, and sneezing and rhinorrhea. On specu-
lum  examination  of  the  nose,  excess  mucoid  or  purulent  secretions, 
inflamed and edematous nasal mucosa, and/or polyps may be seen; in 
addition, secretions or a cobblestoned appearance of the mucosa along 
the posterior pharyngeal wall may be noted. Unfortunately, there is no 
means by which to quantitate postnasal drainage. In many instances, 
this  diagnosis  must  rely  on  subjective  information  provided  by  the 
patient. Furthermore, this assessment must also be counterbalanced by 
the fact that many people who have chronic postnasal drainage do not 
experience cough.

Linking  gastroesophageal  reflux  to  chronic  cough  poses  similar 
challenges. It is thought that reflux of gastric contents into the lower 
esophagus may trigger cough via reflex pathways initiated in the esoph-
ageal  mucosa.  Reflux  to  the  level  of  the  pharynx  (laryngopharyngeal 
reflux), with consequent aspiration of gastric contents, causes a chem-
ical bronchitis and possibly pneumonitis that can elicit cough for days 
afterward, but it is a rare finding among persons with chronic cough. 
Retrosternal burning after meals or on recumbency, frequent eructa-
tion, hoarseness, and throat pain may be indicative of gastroesophageal 
reflux.  Nevertheless,  reflux  may  also  elicit  minimal  or  no  symptoms. 
Glottic  inflammation  detected  on  laryngoscopy  may  be  a  manifesta-
tion of recurrent reflux to the level of the throat, but it is a nonspecific 
finding.  Quantification  of  the  frequency  and  level  of  reflux  requires 
a  somewhat  invasive  procedure  to  measure  esophageal  pH  (either 
nasopharyngeal  placement  of  a  catheter  with  a  pH  probe  into  the 
esophagus for 24 h or endoscopic placement of a radiotransmitter cap-
sule into the esophagus) and, with newer techniques, esophageal pres-
sures  (manometry)  and  nonacid  reflux.  The  precise  interpretation  of 
test results that permits an etiologic linking of reflux events and cough 
remains debated. Again, assigning the cause of cough to gastroesopha-
geal reflux must be weighed against the observation that many people 
with symptomatic reflux do not experience chronic cough.

Cough  alone  as  a  manifestation  of  asthma  is  common  among 
children  but  not  among  adults.  Cough  due  to  asthma  in  the  absence 
of wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness is referred to as 
“cough-variant asthma.” A history suggestive of cough-variant asthma 

ties the onset of cough to exposure to typical triggers for asthma and the 
resolution  of  cough  to  discontinuation  of  exposure.  Objective  testing 
can establish the diagnosis of asthma (airflow obstruction on spirome-
try that varies over time or reverses in response to a bronchodilator) or 
exclude it with certainty (a negative response to a bronchoprovocation 
challenge—e.g.,  with  methacholine).  In  a  patient  capable  of  taking 
reliable measurements, home expiratory peak flow monitoring can be 
a cost-effective method to support or discount a diagnosis of asthma.

Eosinophilic  bronchitis  causes  chronic  cough  with  a  normal  chest 
radiograph.  This  uncommon  condition  is  characterized  by  sputum 
eosinophilia in excess of 3% without airflow obstruction or bronchial 
hyperresponsiveness and is successfully treated with inhaled glucocor-
ticoids.  Measurement  of  an  elevated  concentration  of  nitric  oxide  in 
exhaled breath has the potential to detect eosinophilic airway inflam-
mation (in asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis) and predict a favorable 
response to inhaled steroids in persons with chronic cough.

Treatment of chronic cough in a patient with a normal chest radio-
graph is often empirical and is targeted at the most likely cause(s) of 
cough  as  determined  by  history,  physical  examination,  and  possibly 
pulmonary function testing. Therapy for postnasal drainage depends 
on the presumed etiology (infection, allergy, or vasomotor rhinitis) and 
may include systemic antihistamines; decongestants; antibiotics; nasal 
saline irrigation; and nasal pump sprays with glucocorticoids, antihis-
tamines, or anticholinergics. Antacids histamine type 2 (H2) receptor 
antagonists,  and  proton  pump  inhibitors  are  used  to  neutralize  or 
decrease the production of gastric acid in gastroesophageal reflux dis-
ease; dietary changes, elevation of the head and torso during sleep, and 
medications to improve gastric emptying or impede the flow of reflux-
ate (e.g., alginates) are additional therapeutic measures. Cough-variant 
asthma typically responds well to inhaled glucocorticoids and intermit-
tent use of inhaled β-agonist bronchodilators.

Patients  who  fail  to  respond  to  treatment  targeting  the  common 
causes  of  chronic  cough  or  who  have  had  these  causes  excluded  by 
appropriate  diagnostic  testing  should,  in  the  opinion  of  the  author, 
undergo  chest  CT.  Diseases  causing  cough  that  may  be  missed  on 
chest  x-ray  include  tumors,  early  interstitial  lung  disease,  bronchiec-
tasis,  and  atypical  mycobacterial  pulmonary  infection.  On  the  other 
hand, patients with chronic cough who have normal findings on chest 
examination, lung function testing, oxygenation assessment, and chest 
CT can be reassured as to the absence of serious pulmonary pathology.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Regular exposure to air pollution can cause chronic cough and throat 
clearing, as well as lower respiratory tract disease. Smoke from cooking 
and heating fuels in poorly ventilated homes; toxic exposures in work 
settings lacking implementation of occupational safety standards; and 
ambient chemicals and particulates in highly polluted outdoor air are 
all forms of air pollution causing cough. Limited therapeutic options 
are available; treatment focuses on improving environmental air qual-
ity (e.g., use of a stove chimney in the home), removal from the expo-
sure, and use of an appropriate face mask.

In areas of the world where tuberculosis is endemic, chronic cough 
conjures the possibility of active pulmonary tuberculosis and mandates 
appropriate evaluation, including chest imaging and sputum analysis.

 ■ SYMPTOM-BASED TREATMENT OF COUGH
Empiric treatment of chronic idiopathic cough with inhaled corticos-
teroids,  inhaled  anticholinergic  bronchodilators,  and  macrolide  anti-
biotics  has  been  tried  without  consistent  success.  Currently  available 
cough suppressants are only modestly effective. Most potent are nar-
cotic cough suppressants, such as codeine, hydrocodone, or morphine, 
which are thought to act in the “cough center” in the brainstem. The 
tendency of narcotic cough suppressants to cause drowsiness and con-
stipation and their potential for addictive dependence limit their appeal 
for long-term use. Dextromethorphan is an over-the-counter, centrally 
acting cough suppressant with fewer side effects and less efficacy than 
the narcotic cough suppressants. Dextromethorphan is thought to have 
a different site of action than narcotic cough suppressants and can be 
used in combination with them if necessary. Benzonatate is thought to

inhibit neural activity of sensory nerves in the cough-reflex pathway. It 
is generally free of side effects; however, its effectiveness in suppressing 
cough is variable and unpredictable. Inhaled lidocaine, an inhibitor of 
voltage-gated sodium channels, provides transient cough suppression, 
but  because  of  associated  oropharyngeal  anesthesia,  it  poses  the  risk 
of aspiration.

Attempts  to  treat  cough  hypersensitivity  syndrome  have  focused 
on  inhibition  of  neural  pathways.  Small  case  series  and  randomized 
clinical trials have indicated benefit from off-label use of gabapentin, 
pregabalin,  or  amitriptyline.  Recent  studies  suggest  a  role  for  behav-
ioral  modification  using  specialized  speech  therapy  techniques,  but 
widespread  application  of  this  modality  is  currently  not  practical. 
Novel cough suppressants without the limitations of currently available 
agents are greatly needed. Approaches that are being explored include 
the development of neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, transient recep-
tor  protein  vanilloid-1  (TRPV1)  channel  antagonists,  a  promising 
P2X3 channel antagonist (gefapixant), and novel opioid and opioid-like 
receptor agonists.

39 Hemoptysis

Carolyn M. D’Ambrosio

Hemoptysis  is  the  expectoration  of  blood  from  the  respiratory  tract. 
Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (hematemesis) or nasal cavities 
(epistaxis) can mimic hemoptysis. Once established as hemoptysis, the 
degree of blood that is being expectorated (volume and frequency) is 
the  next  step  as  massive  or  life-threatening  hemoptysis  (>400  mL  of 
blood in 24 h or >150 mL at one time) requires emergent intervention. 
This chapter will focus predominantly on non–life-threatening hemop-
tysis. The source of the bleeding as well as the cause are the next steps 
when approaching a patient with hemoptysis.

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF 
HEMOPTYSIS
Hemoptysis can arise from anywhere in the respiratory tract, from the 
glottis to the alveolus. Most commonly, bleeding arises from the bron-
chi or medium-sized airways, but a thorough evaluation of the entire 
respiratory tree is important.

The dual blood supply of the lungs makes it unique. The lungs have 
both the pulmonary and bronchial circulations. The pulmonary circu-
lation is a low-pressure system that is essential for gas exchange at the 
alveolar level; in contrast, the bronchial circulation originates from the 
aorta and, therefore, is a higher-pressure system. The bronchial arteries 
supply the airways and can neovascularize tumors, dilated airways of 
bronchiectasis, and cavitary lesions. Most hemoptysis originates from 
the bronchial circulation, and bleeding from the higher-pressure sys-
tem makes it more difficult to stop.

ETIOLOGY
Hemoptysis commonly results from infection, malignancy, or vascular 
disease; however, the differential for bleeding from the respiratory tree 
is varied and broad. In the United States, the most common causes are 
viral  bronchitis,  bronchiectasis,  or  malignancy.  In  other  parts  of  the 
world, infections such as tuberculosis are the most common causes.

Infections  Most  blood-tinged  sputum  and  small-volume  hemop-
tysis  are  due  to  viral  bronchitis.  Patients  with  chronic  bronchitis  are 
at risk for bacterial superinfection with organisms such as Streptococ-
cus  pneumoniae,  Haemophilus  influenzae,  or  Moraxella  catarrhalis, 
increasing airway inflammation and potential for bleeding. Similarly, 
patients  with  bronchiectasis  are  prone  to  hemoptysis  during  exacer-
bations.  Due  to  recurrent  bacterial  infection,  bronchiectatic  airways 
are  dilated,  inflamed,  and  highly  vascular,  supplied  by  the  bronchial 
circulation. In several case series, bronchiectasis is the leading cause of 
massive hemoptysis and subsequent death.

Tuberculosis had long been the most common cause of hemoptysis 
worldwide, but it is now surpassed in industrialized countries by bron-
chitis  and  bronchiectasis.  In  patients  with  tuberculosis,  development 
of cavitary disease is frequently the source of bleeding, but rarer com-
plications such as the erosion of a pulmonary artery aneurysm into a 
preexisting cavity (i.e., Rasmussen’s aneurysm) can also be the source.
Other infectious agents such as endemic fungi, Nocardia, and non-
tuberculous  mycobacteria  can  present  as  cavitary  lung  disease  com-
plicated  by  hemoptysis.  In  addition,  Aspergillus  species  can  develop 
into  mycetomas  within  preexisting  cavities,  with  neovascularization 
to  these  inflamed  spaces  leading  to  bleeding.  Pulmonary  abscesses 
and  necrotizing  pneumonia  can  cause  bleeding  by  devitalizing  lung 
parenchyma.  Common  responsible  organisms  include  Staphylococcus 
aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and oral anaerobes.

 Paragonimiasis can mimic tuberculosis and is another significant 
cause of hemoptysis seen globally; it is common in Southeast Asia and 
China, although cases have been reported in North America from raw 
crayfish ingestion. It should be considered as a cause of hemoptysis in 
recent immigrants from endemic areas.

Vascular  Hemoptysis from a vascular cause can be associated with 
cardiac  disease,  pulmonary  embolism,  arteriovenous  malformation, 
or  diffuse  alveolar  hemorrhage  (DAH).  While  the  classic  description 
of  the  sputum  expectorated  in  pulmonary  edema  (from  elevated  left 
end-diastolic pressure) is “pink and frothy,” a spectrum of hemoptysis 
including frank blood can be seen. This observation is particularly true 
now with the more widespread use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet 
medications.

Pulmonary embolism with parenchymal infarction can present with 
hemoptysis,  but  pulmonary  emboli  do  not  commonly  cause  hemop-
tysis.  An  ectatic  vessel  in  an  airway  or  a  pulmonary  arteriovenous 
malformation  can  be  a  source  of  bleeding.  A  rare  vascular  cause  of 
hemoptysis  is  the  rupture  of  an  aortobronchial  fistula;  these  fistulae 
arise in the setting of aortic pathology such as aneurysm or pseudoan-
eurysm  and  can  cause  small  bleeding  episodes  that  herald  massive 
hemoptysis.

DAH  causes  significant  bleeding  into  the  lung  parenchyma  but, 
interestingly, is not often associated with hemoptysis. DAH typically 
presents  with  diffuse  ground  glass  opacities  on  chest  imaging.  A 
range of insults cause DAH, including immune-mediated capillaritis 
from  diseases  such  as  systemic  lupus  erythematosus,  toxicity  from 
cocaine  and  other  inhalants,  and  stem  cell  transplantation.  The

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesso-called  “pulmonary-renal”  syndromes,  including  granulomatosis 
with  polyangiitis  and  anti-glomerular  basement  membrane  disease, 
may  lead  to  both  hemoptysis  and  hematuria  (though  one  manifesta-
tion may be present without the other). A recently identified cause of 
hemoptysis and DAH is vaping-induced lung injury.

Malignancy  Bronchogenic  carcinoma  of  any  histology  is  a  com-
mon cause of hemoptysis (both massive and nonmassive). Hemoptysis 
can indicate airway involvement of the tumor and can be a presenting 
symptom  of  carcinoid  tumors,  vascular  lesions  that  frequently  arise 
in the proximal airways. Small cell and squamous cell carcinomas are 
frequently central in nature and more likely to erode into major pulmo-
nary  vessels,  resulting  in  massive  hemoptysis.  Pulmonary  metastases 
from  distant  tumors  (e.g.,  melanoma,  sarcoma,  adenocarcinomas  of 
the breast and colon) can also cause bleeding. Kaposi’s sarcoma, seen in 
advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is very vascular and 
can develop anywhere along the respiratory tract, from the bronchi to 
the oral cavity.

Mechanical and Other Causes 
In addition to infection, vascular 
disease,  and  malignancy,  other  insults  to  the  pulmonary  system  can 
cause  hemoptysis.  Pulmonary  endometriosis  causes  cyclical  bleeding 
known as catamenial hemoptysis. Foreign body aspiration can lead to 
airway irritation and bleeding. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures 
are also potential offenders: pulmonary vein stenosis can result from 
left  atrial  procedures,  such  as  pulmonary  vein  isolation,  and  pulmo-
nary artery catheters can lead to rupture of the pulmonary artery if the 
distal balloon is kept inflated. Finally, in the setting of thrombocytope-
nia, coagulopathy, anticoagulation, or antiplatelet therapy, even minor 
insults can cause hemoptysis.

 ■ EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT
History  The  amount  or  severity  of  bleeding  is  the  first  step  in 
assessing a patient with hemoptysis. A patient’s description of the spu-
tum (e.g., flecks of blood, pink-tinged, or frank blood or clot) is helpful 
if you cannot examine it. An approach to management of hemoptysis 
is outlined in Fig. 39-1.

While  there  is  no  agreed-upon  volume,  blood  loss  of  400  mL  in 
24  h  or  100–150  mL  expectorated  at  one  time  should  be  considered 
life-threatening  hemoptysis.  These  numbers  derive  from  the  blood 
volume of the tracheobronchial tree (generally 100–200 mL). Patients 
rarely  die  of  exsanguination  but,  rather,  are  at  risk  of  death  due  to 
asphyxiation  from  blood  filling  the  airways  and  airspaces.  Most 
patients cannot describe the volume of their hemoptysis in milliliters, 
so using referents like cups (one U.S. cup is 236 mL) can be helpful. 
Fortunately,  life-threatening  hemoptysis  only  accounts  for  5–15%  of 
cases of hemoptysis.

The history may point to the cause of hemoptysis. Fever, chills, or 
antecedent cough may suggest infection. A history of smoking or unin-
tentional  weight  loss  makes  malignancy  more  likely.  Patients  should 
be asked about inhalational exposures, including vaping. A thorough 
medical  history  with  careful  attention  to  chronic  pulmonary  disease 
should be obtained, with evaluation of risk factors for malignancy and 
bronchiectatic lung disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis).

Physical Examination  Reviewing the vital signs is an important 
first  step.  Patients  who  have  life-threatening  hemoptysis  can  have 
hypoxemia,  tachycardia,  and  hemodynamic  instability.  As  the  site  of 
bleeding is important, evaluation of the nasal and oral cavities is imper-
ative. In addition, auscultation of the lungs and seeking other relevant 
physical findings such as clubbing can point to a cause of the hemop-
tysis. A focal area of wheezing could suggest a foreign body aspiration. 
Other signs of a bleeding diathesis (e.g., skin or mucosal ecchymoses 
and  petechiae)  or  telangiectasias  may  suggest  other  etiologies  of  the 
hemoptysis.

Diagnostic Studies 
Initial studies should include measurement of 
a  complete  blood  count  to  assess  for  infection,  anemia,  or  thrombo-
cytopenia;  coagulation  parameters;  measurement  of  electrolytes  and 
renal  function;  and  urinalysis  to  exclude  pulmonary-renal  disease. 
Chest imaging is necessary for every patient.

A chest radiograph is usually obtained first, although it frequently 
does  not  localize  bleeding  and  can  appear  normal.  In  patients  with-
out  risk  factors  for  malignancy  or  other  abnormalities  in  the  initial 
evaluation  and  with  a  normal  chest 
radiograph,  treating  for  bronchitis 
and ensuring close follow-up is a rea-
sonable  strategy,  with  further  diag-
nostic workup.

In contrast, patients with risk fac-
tors  for  malignancy  (i.e.,  age  >40  or 
a  smoking  history)  should  undergo 
additional  testing.  First,  chest  com-
puted  tomography  (CT)  with  con-
trast  should  be  obtained  to  better 
identify  masses,  bronchiectasis,  and 
parenchymal  lesions.  A  CT  looking 
for  pulmonary  embolism  should  be 
considered if the history and physical 
examination are consistent with that 
diagnosis. Following a CT, a flexible 
bronchoscopy  should  be  performed 
to  exclude  bronchogenic  carcinoma 
unless  imaging  reveals  a  lesion  that 
can  be  sampled  without  bronchos-
copy.  Small  case  series  show  that 
patients  with  hemoptysis  and  unre-
vealing  bronchoscopies  have  good 
outcomes.

Interventions  When the amount 
of  hemoptysis  is  massive  or  life- 
threatening, there are three simultane-
ous goals: first, protect the nonbleeding 
lung;  second,  locate  the  site  of  bleed-
ing; and third, control the bleeding.

Protecting  the  airway  and  nonbleeding  lung  is  paramount  in  the 
management  of  massive  hemoptysis  because  asphyxiation  can  hap-
pen  quickly.  If  the  side  of  bleeding  is  known,  the  patient  should  be 
positioned with the bleeding side down to use gravitational advantage 
to  keep  blood  out  of  the  nonbleeding  lung.  Endotracheal  intubation 
should be avoided unless truly necessary, since suctioning through an 
endotracheal tube is a less effective means of removing blood and clot 
than  the  cough  reflex.  If  intubation  is  required,  take  steps  to  protect 
the nonbleeding lung either by selective intubation of one lung (i.e., the 
nonbleeding lung) or insertion of a double-lumen endotracheal tube.

Locating  the  bleeding  site  is  sometimes  obvious,  but  frequently,  it 
can be difficult to determine. A chest radiograph, if it shows new opac-
ities, can be helpful in localizing the side or site of bleeding, although 
this test is not adequate by itself. CT angiography helps by localizing 
active extravasation. Flexible bronchoscopy may be useful to identify 
the side of bleeding (although it has only a 50% chance of locating the 
site).  Experts  do  not  agree  on  the  timing  of  bronchoscopy,  although 
in  some  cases—cystic  fibrosis,  for  instance—bronchoscopy  is  not 
recommended  because  it  may  delay  definitive  management.  Finally, 
proceeding directly to angiography is also a reasonable strategy given 
that it has both diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.

Controlling  the  bleeding  during  an  episode  of  life-threatening 
hemoptysis can be accomplished in one of three ways: from the airway 
lumen, from the involved blood vessel, or by surgical resection of both 
airway  and  vessel  involved.  Bronchoscopic  measures  are  generally 
only temporizing: a flexible bronchoscope can be used to suction clot 
and  insert  a  balloon  catheter  or  bronchial  blocker  that  occludes  the 
involved  airway.  Rigid  bronchoscopy,  done  by  an  interventional  pul-
monologist or thoracic surgeon, may allow therapeutic interventions of 
bleeding airway lesions such as photocoagulation and cautery. Because 
most  life-threatening  cases  of  hemoptysis  arise  from  the  bronchial 
circulation,  bronchial  artery  embolization  is  the  procedure  of  choice 
for  control  of  the  bleeding.  However,  bronchial  artery  embolization 
can have significant complications such as embolization of the anterior 
spinal  artery.  However,  it  is  generally  successful  in  the  short  term, 
with >80% success rate at controlling bleeding immediately, although 
bleeding can recur if the underlying disease (e.g., a mycetoma) is not 
treated. Surgical resection has a high mortality rate (up to 15–40%) and 
should not be pursued unless initial measures have failed and bleeding 
is ongoing. Ideal candidates for surgery have localized disease but oth-
erwise normal lung parenchyma.

40 Hypoxia and Cyanosis

Joseph Loscalzo

HYPOXIA
The fundamental purpose of the cardiorespiratory system is to deliver 
O2  and  nutrients  to  cells  and  to  remove  CO2  and  other  metabolic 
products from them. Proper maintenance of this function depends not 
only on intact cardiovascular and respiratory systems, but also on an 
adequate number of red blood cells and hemoglobin and a supply of 
inspired gas containing adequate O2.
 ■ RESPONSES TO HYPOXIA
Decreased  O2  availability  to  cells  typically  results  in  an  inhibition  of 
oxidative  phosphorylation  and  increased  anaerobic  glycolysis.  This 
switch  from  aerobic  to  anaerobic  metabolism,  the  Pasteur  effect, 
reduces  the  rate  of  adenosine  5′-triphosphate  (ATP)  production. 
In  severe  hypoxia,  when  ATP  production  is  inadequate  to  meet  the 
energy requirements of ionic and osmotic equilibrium, cell membrane 
depolarization leads to uncontrolled Ca2+ influx and activation of Ca2+- 
dependent  phospholipases  and  proteases.  These  events,  in  turn,  cause 
cell swelling, activation of apoptotic pathways, and, ultimately, cell death.
The  adaptations  to  hypoxia  are  mediated,  in  part,  by  the  upreg-
ulation  of  genes  encoding  a  variety  of  proteins,  including  glycolytic 
enzymes,  such  as  phosphoglycerate  kinase  and  phosphofructokinase, 
as  well  as  the  glucose  transporters  Glut-1  and  Glut-2;  and  by  growth 
factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythro-
poietin, which enhance erythrocyte production. The hypoxia-induced 
increase in expression of these and other key proteins is governed by 
the  hypoxia-sensitive  transcription  factor,  hypoxia-inducible  factor-1 
(HIF-1).

During  hypoxia,  systemic  arterioles  dilate,  at  least  in  part,  by 
opening of KATP channels in vascular smooth-muscle cells due to the 
hypoxia-induced reduction in ATP concentration. By contrast, in pul-
monary vascular smooth-muscle cells, inhibition of K+ channels causes 
depolarization,  which,  in  turn,  activates  voltage-gated  Ca2+  channels, 
raising  the  cytosolic  [Ca2+]  and  causing  smooth-muscle  cell  contrac-
tion.  Hypoxia-induced  pulmonary  arterial  constriction  shunts  blood 
away from poorly ventilated portions toward better ventilated portions 
of  the  lung  (i.e.,  improves  ventilation-perfusion  mismatch);  however, 
it  also  increases  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  right  ventricular 
afterload.
Effects on the Central Nervous System  Changes in the central 
nervous  system  (CNS),  particularly  the  higher  centers,  are  especially 
important  consequences  of  hypoxia.  Acute  hypoxia  causes  impaired 
judgment,  motor  incoordination,  and  a  clinical  picture  resembling 
acute  alcohol  intoxication.  High-altitude  illness  is  characterized  by 
headache  secondary  to  cerebral  vasodilation,  gastrointestinal  symp-
toms,  dizziness,  insomnia,  fatigue,  or  somnolence.  Pulmonary  arte-
rial  and  sometimes  venous  constriction  causes  capillary  leakage  and 
high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) (Chap. 37), which intensifies 
hypoxia,  further  promoting  vasoconstriction.  Rarely,  high-altitude 
cerebral  edema  (HACE)  develops,  which  is  manifest  by  severe  head-
ache and papilledema and can cause coma. As hypoxia becomes more 
severe, the regulatory centers of the brainstem are affected, and death 
usually results from respiratory failure.

Effects  on  the  Cardiovascular  System  Acute  hypoxia  stim-
ulates  the  chemoreceptor  reflex  arc  to  induce  venoconstriction  and 
systemic  arterial  vasodilation.  These  acute  changes  are  accompanied 
by transiently increased myocardial contractility, which is followed by 
depressed myocardial contractility with prolonged hypoxia.
 ■ CAUSES OF HYPOXIA
Respiratory  Hypoxia  When  hypoxia  occurs  from  respiratory 
failure,  Pao2  declines,  and  when  respiratory  failure  is  persistent,  the

hemoglobin-oxygen (Hb-O2) dissociation curve (see Fig. 98-2) is dis-
placed  to  the  right,  with  greater  quantities  of  O2  released  at  any  level 
of tissue Po2. Arterial hypoxemia, that is, a reduction of O2 saturation 
of arterial blood (Sao2), and consequent cyanosis are likely to be more 
marked when such depression of Pao2 results from pulmonary disease 
than when the depression occurs as the result of a decline in the fraction 
of oxygen in inspired air (Fio2). In this latter situation, Paco2 falls sec-
ondary to anoxia-induced hyperventilation and the Hb-O2 dissociation 
curve is displaced to the left, limiting the decline in Sao2 at any level of 
Pao2.

The  most  common  cause  of  respiratory  hypoxia  is  ventilation- 
perfusion  mismatch  resulting  from  perfusion  of  poorly  ventilated 
alveoli. Respiratory hypoxemia may also be caused by hypoventilation, 
in which case it is associated with an elevation of Paco2 (Chap. 285). 
These  two  forms  of  respiratory  hypoxia  are  usually  correctable  by 
inspiring  100%  O2  for  several  minutes.  A  third  cause  of  respiratory 
hypoxia is shunting of blood across the lung from the pulmonary arte-
rial to the venous bed (intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting) by perfu-
sion of nonventilated portions of the lung, as in pulmonary atelectasis 
or through pulmonary arteriovenous connections. The low Pao2 in this 
situation is only partially corrected by an Fio2 of 100%.
Hypoxia  Secondary  to  High  Altitude  As  one  ascends  rapidly 
to  3000  m  (~10,000  ft),  the  reduction  of  the  O2  content  of  inspired 
air  (Fio2)  leads  to  a  decrease  in  alveolar  Po2  to  ∼60  mmHg,  and  a 
condition termed high-altitude illness develops (see above). At higher 
altitudes,  arterial  saturation  declines  rapidly  and  symptoms  become 
more  serious;  and  at  5000  m,  unacclimated  individuals  usually  cease 
to be able to function normally owing to the changes in CNS function 
described above.

Hypoxia  Secondary  to  Right-to-Left  Extrapulmonary  
Shunting  From  a  physiologic  viewpoint,  this  cause  of  hypoxia 
resembles intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting but is caused by con-
genital cardiac malformations, such as tetralogy of Fallot, transposition 
of  the  great  arteries,  atrial  or  ventricular  septal  defect,  patent  ductus 
arteriosus,  and  Eisenmenger’s  syndrome  (Chap.  269).  As  in  pulmo-
nary right-to-left shunting, the Pao2 cannot be restored to normal with 
inspiration of 100% O2.
Anemic Hypoxia  A reduction in hemoglobin concentration of the 
blood is accompanied by a corresponding decline in the O2-carrying 
capacity of the blood. Although the Pao2 is normal in anemic hypoxia, 
the  absolute  quantity  of  O2  transported  per  unit  volume  of  blood  is 
diminished. As the anemic blood passes through the capillaries and the 
usual quantity of O2 is removed from it, the Po2 and saturation in the 
venous blood decline to a greater extent than normal.

Carbon  Monoxide  (CO)  Intoxication 
(See  also  Chap.  463) 
Hemoglobin  that  binds  with  CO  (carboxy-hemoglobin  [COHb])  is 
unavailable for O2 transport. In addition, the presence of COHb shifts 
the Hb-O2 dissociation curve to the left (see Fig. 98-2) so that O2 is 
unloaded only at lower tensions, further contributing to tissue hypoxia.

Circulatory  Hypoxia  As  in  anemic  hypoxia,  the  Pao2  is  usually 
normal, but venous and tissue Po2 values are reduced as a consequence 
of reduced tissue perfusion and greater tissue O2 extraction. This patho-
physiology  leads  to  an  increased  arterial-mixed  venous  O2  difference 
(a-v-O2 difference), or gradient. Generalized circulatory hypoxia occurs 
in heart failure (Chap. 257) and in most forms of shock (Chap. 303).

Specific Organ Hypoxia  Localized circulatory hypoxia may occur 
as a result of decreased perfusion secondary to arterial obstruction, as 
in localized atherosclerosis in any vascular bed, or as a consequence of 
vasoconstriction, as observed in Raynaud’s phenomenon (Chap. 281). 
Localized  hypoxia  may  also  result  from  venous  obstruction  and  the 
resultant expansion of interstitial fluid causing arteriolar compression 
and, thereby, reduction of arterial inflow. Edema, which increases the 
distance through which O2 must diffuse before it reaches cells, can also 
cause localized hypoxia. In an attempt to maintain adequate perfusion 
to more vital organs in patients with reduced cardiac output secondary 

to  heart  failure  or  hypovolemic  shock,  vasoconstriction  may  reduce 
perfusion in the limbs and skin, causing hypoxia of these regions.
Increased  O2  Requirements 
If  the  O2  consumption  of  tissues  is 
elevated  without  a  corresponding  increase  in  perfusion,  tissue  hypoxia 
ensues and the Po2 in venous blood declines. Ordinarily, the clinical pic-
ture of patients with hypoxia due to an elevated metabolic rate, as in fever 
or thyrotoxicosis, is quite different from that in other types of hypoxia: 
the skin is warm and flushed owing to increased cutaneous blood flow 
that dissipates the excessive heat produced, and cyanosis is usually absent.
Exercise is a classic example of increased tissue O2 requirements. These 
increased demands are normally met by several mechanisms operating 
simultaneously:  (1)  increase  in  the  cardiac  output  and  ventilation  and, 
thus, O2 delivery to the tissues; (2) a preferential shift in blood flow to 
the exercising muscles by changing vascular resistances in the circulatory 
beds of exercising tissues, directly and/or reflexly; (3) an increase in O2 
extraction from the delivered blood and a widening of the arteriovenous 
O2 difference; and (4) a reduction in the pH of the tissues and capillary 
blood, shifting the Hb-O2 curve to the right (see Fig. 98-2), and unload-
ing more O2 from hemoglobin. If the capacity of these mechanisms is 
exceeded, then hypoxia, especially of the exercising muscles, will result.

Improper Oxygen Utilization  Cyanide (Chap. 459) and several 
other similarly acting poisons cause cellular hypoxia by impairing elec-
tron transport in mitochondria, thereby limiting oxidative phosphory-
lation and ATP production. The tissues are unable to use O2, and as a 
consequence, the venous blood tends to have a high O2 tension. This 
condition has been termed histotoxic hypoxia.
 ■ ADAPTATION TO HYPOXIA
An important component of the respiratory response to hypoxia orig-
inates in special chemosensitive cells in the carotid and aortic bodies 
and in the respiratory center in the brainstem. The stimulation of these 
cells by hypoxia increases ventilation, with a loss of CO2, and can lead 
to  respiratory  alkalosis.  When  combined  with  the  metabolic  acidosis 
resulting  from  the  production  of  lactic  acid,  the  serum  bicarbonate 
level declines (Chap. 55).

With the reduction of Pao2, cerebrovascular resistance decreases and 
cerebral blood flow increases in an attempt to maintain O2 delivery to 
the  brain.  However,  when  the  reduction  of  Pao2  is  accompanied  by 
hyperventilation and a reduction of Paco2, cerebrovascular resistance 
rises, cerebral blood flow falls, and tissue hypoxia intensifies.

The diffuse, systemic vasodilation that occurs in generalized hypoxia 
increases the cardiac output. In patients with underlying heart disease, 
the requirements of peripheral tissues for an increase of cardiac output 
with hypoxia may precipitate congestive heart failure. In patients with 
ischemic heart disease, a reduced Pao2 may intensify myocardial ische-
mia and further impair left ventricular function.

One  of  the  important  compensatory  mechanisms  for  chronic 
hypoxia  is  an  increase  in  the  hemoglobin  concentration  and  in  the 
number of red blood cells in the circulating blood, that is, the devel-
opment of polycythemia induced by erythropoietin production (Chap. 
103).  In  persons  with  chronic  hypoxemia  secondary  to  prolonged 
residence at a high altitude (>13,000 ft, 4200 m), a condition termed 
chronic mountain sickness develops. This disorder is characterized by a 
blunted  respiratory  drive,  reduced  ventilation,  erythrocytosis,  cyano-
sis, weakness, right ventricular enlargement secondary to pulmonary 
hypertension, and even stupor.

CYANOSIS
Cyanosis refers to a bluish color of the skin and mucous membranes 
resulting  from  an  increased  quantity  of  reduced  hemoglobin  (i.e., 
deoxygenated hemoglobin) or of hemoglobin derivatives (e.g., methe-
moglobin  or  sulfhemoglobin)  in  the  small  blood  vessels  of  those 
tissues. It is usually most marked in the lips, nail beds, ears, and malar 
eminences.  Cyanosis,  especially  if  developed  recently,  is  more  com-
monly detected by a family member than the patient. The florid skin 
characteristic of polycythemia vera (Chap. 103) must be distinguished 
from the true cyanosis discussed here. A cherry-colored flush, rather 
than cyanosis, is caused by COHb (Chap. 459).

The  degree  of  cyanosis  is  modified  by  the  color  of  the  cutaneous 
pigment  and  the  thickness  of  the  skin,  as  well  as  by  the  state  of  the 
cutaneous  capillaries.  The  accurate  clinical  detection  of  the  presence 
and degree of cyanosis is difficult, as proved by oximetric studies. In 
some  instances,  central  cyanosis  can  be  detected  reliably  when  the 
Sao2 has fallen to 85%; in others, particularly in dark-skinned persons, 
it may not be detected until it has declined to 75%. In the latter case, 
examination of the mucous membranes in the oral cavity and the con-
junctivae  rather  than  examination  of  the  skin  is  more  helpful  in  the 
detection of cyanosis.

The increase in the quantity of reduced hemoglobin in the mucocuta-
neous vessels that produces cyanosis may be brought about either by an 
increase in the quantity of venous blood as a result of dilation of the ven-
ules (including precapillary venules) or by a reduction in the Sao2 in the 
capillary blood. In general, cyanosis becomes apparent when the concen-
tration of reduced hemoglobin in capillary blood exceeds 40 g/L (4 g/dL).
It is the absolute, rather than the relative, quantity of reduced hemo-
globin that is important in producing cyanosis. Thus, in a patient with 
severe  anemia,  the  relative  quantity  of  reduced  hemoglobin  in  the 
venous blood may be very large when considered in relation to the total 
quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. However, since the concentration 
of  the  latter  is  markedly  reduced,  the  absolute  quantity  of  reduced 
hemoglobin may still be low, and, therefore, patients with severe ane-
mia and even marked arterial desaturation may not display cyanosis. 
Conversely, the higher the total hemoglobin content, the greater is the 
tendency  toward  cyanosis;  thus,  patients  with  marked  polycythemia 
tend to be cyanotic at higher levels of Sao2 than patients with normal 
hematocrit  values.  Likewise,  local  passive  congestion,  which  causes 
an increase in the total quantity of reduced hemoglobin in the vessels 
in  a  given  area,  may  cause  cyanosis.  Cyanosis  is  also  observed  when 
nonfunctional hemoglobin, such as methemoglobin (consequential or 
acquired) or sulfhemoglobin (Chap. 98), is present in blood.

Cyanosis  may  be  subdivided  into  central  and  peripheral  types.  In 
central cyanosis, the Sao2 is reduced or an abnormal hemoglobin deriv-
ative is present, and the mucous membranes and skin are both affected. 
Peripheral cyanosis is due to a slowing of blood flow and abnormally 
great extraction of O2 from normally saturated arterial blood; it results 
from vasoconstriction and diminished peripheral blood flow, such as 
occurs in cold exposure, shock, congestive failure, and peripheral vas-
cular disease. Often in these conditions, the mucous membranes of the 
oral cavity, including the sublingual mucosa, may be spared. Clinical 
differentiation between central and peripheral cyanosis may not always 
be straightforward, and in conditions such as cardiogenic shock with 
pulmonary edema, there may be a mixture of both types.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Central  Cyanosis  (Table  40-1)  Decreased  Sao2  results  from  a 
marked reduction in the Pao2. This reduction may be brought about 
by  a  decline  in  the  Fio2  without  sufficient  compensatory  alveolar 
hyperventilation  to  maintain  alveolar  Po2.  Cyanosis  usually  becomes 
manifest in an ascent to an altitude of 4000 m (13,000 ft).

Seriously impaired pulmonary function, through perfusion of unven-
tilated or poorly ventilated areas of the lung or alveolar hypoventilation, 
is a common cause of central cyanosis (Chap. 285). This condition may 
occur  acutely,  as  in  extensive  pneumonia  or  pulmonary  edema,  or 
chronically, with chronic pulmonary diseases (e.g., emphysema). In the 
latter situation, secondary polycythemia is generally present and club-
bing of the fingers (see below) may occur. Another cause of reduced 
Sao2 is shunting of systemic venous blood into the arterial circuit. Certain 
forms of congenital heart disease are associated with cyanosis on this 
basis (see above and Chap. 269).

Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae may be congenital or acquired, sol-
itary or multiple, and microscopic or massive. The severity of cyanosis 
produced by these fistulae depends on their size and number. They occur 
with  some  frequency  in  hereditary  hemorrhagic  telangiectasia.  Sao2 
reduction and cyanosis may also occur in some patients with cirrhosis, 
presumably as a consequence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae or 
portal vein–pulmonary vein anastomoses.

Peripheral Cyanosis

Venous obstruction

In patients with cardiac or pulmonary right-to-left shunts, the pres-
ence and severity of cyanosis depend on the size of the shunt relative 
to the systemic flow and on the Hb-O2 saturation of the venous blood. 
With increased extraction of O2 from the blood by the exercising mus-
cles, the venous blood returning to the right side of the heart is more 
unsaturated  than  at  rest,  and  shunting  of  this  blood  intensifies  the 
cyanosis. Secondary polycythemia occurs frequently in patients in this 
setting and contributes to the cyanosis.

Cyanosis  can  be  caused  by  small  quantities  of  circulating  methe-
moglobin (Hb Fe3+) and by even smaller quantities of sulfhemoglobin 
(Chap. 98); both of these hemoglobin derivatives impair oxygen deliv-
ery  to  the  tissues.  Although  they  are  uncommon  causes  of  cyanosis, 
these abnormal hemoglobin species should be sought by spectroscopy 
when cyanosis is not readily explained by malfunction of the circula-
tory or respiratory systems. Generally, digital clubbing does not occur 
with them.

Peripheral Cyanosis  Probably the most common cause of periph-
eral  cyanosis  is  the  normal  vasoconstriction  resulting  from  exposure 
to cold air or water. When cardiac output is reduced, cutaneous vaso-
constriction  occurs  as  a  compensatory  mechanism  so  that  blood  is 
diverted from the skin to more vital areas such as the CNS and heart, 
and  cyanosis  of  the  extremities  may  result  even  though  the  arterial 
blood is normally saturated.

Arterial obstruction to an extremity, as with an embolus, or arteri-
olar constriction, as in cold-induced vasospasm (Raynaud’s phenom-
enon) (Chap. 281), generally results in pallor and coldness, and there 
may be associated cyanosis. Venous obstruction, as in thrombophlebi-
tis or deep venous thrombosis, dilates the subpapillary venous plexuses 
and thereby intensifies cyanosis.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Cyanosis

Certain features are important in arriving at the cause of cyanosis:

1.  It is important to ascertain the time of onset of cyanosis. Cya-
nosis present since birth or infancy is usually due to congenital 
heart disease.

2.  Central and peripheral cyanosis must be differentiated. Evidence 
of  disorders  of  the  respiratory  or  cardiovascular  systems  is 
helpful. Massage or gentle warming of a cyanotic extremity will 
increase  peripheral  blood  flow  and  abolish  peripheral,  but  not 
central, cyanosis.

3.  The  presence  or  absence  of  clubbing  of  the  digits  (see  below) 
should  be  ascertained.  The  combination  of  cyanosis  and  club-
bing  is  frequent  in  patients  with  congenital  heart  disease  and 
right-to-left  shunting  and  is  seen  occasionally  in  patients  with 
pulmonary  disease,  such  as  lung  abscess  or  pulmonary  arte-
riovenous  fistulae.  In  contrast,  peripheral  cyanosis  or  acutely 
developing central cyanosis is not associated with clubbed digits.
4.  Pao2 and Sao2 should be determined, and in patients with cyano-
sis in whom the mechanism is obscure, spectroscopic examina-
tion of the blood should be performed to look for abnormal types 
of hemoglobin (critical in the differential diagnosis of cyanosis).

CLUBBING
The selective bulbous enlargement of the distal segments of the fingers 
and toes due to proliferation of connective tissue, particularly on the 
dorsal surface, is termed clubbing; there is also increased sponginess of 
the soft tissue at the base of the clubbed nail. Clubbing may be heredi-
tary, idiopathic, or acquired and associated with a variety of disorders, 
including cyanotic congenital heart disease (see above), infective endo-
carditis, and a variety of pulmonary conditions (among them primary 
and metastatic lung cancer, bronchiectasis, asbestosis, sarcoidosis, lung 
abscess, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, and mesothelioma), as well as with 
some gastrointestinal diseases (including inflammatory bowel disease 
and hepatic cirrhosis). In some instances, it is occupational, for exam-
ple, in jackhammer operators.

Clubbing  in  patients  with  primary  and  metastatic  lung  cancer, 
mesothelioma,  bronchiectasis,  or  hepatic  cirrhosis  may  be  associated 
with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. In this condition, the subperiosteal 
formation  of  new  bone  in  the  distal  diaphyses  of  the  long  bones  of 
the  extremities  causes  pain  and  symmetric  arthritis-like  changes  in 
the  shoulders,  knees,  ankles,  wrists,  and  elbows.  The  diagnosis  of 
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may be confirmed by bone radiograph 
or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI).  Although  the  mechanism  of 
clubbing is unclear, it appears to be secondary to humoral substances 
that cause dilation of the vessels of the distal digits as well as growth 
factors  released  from  platelet  precursors  in  the  digital  circulation.  In 
certain  circumstances,  clubbing  is  reversible,  such  as  following  lung 
transplantation for cystic fibrosis.

PLASMA AND INTERSTITIAL FLUID 
EXCHANGE
Approximately two-thirds of total body water is intracellular and one-
third is extracellular. One-fourth of the latter is in the plasma, and the 
remainder comprises the interstitial fluid. Edema represents an excess 
of interstitial fluid that has become evident clinically.

There  is  constant  interchange  of  fluid  between  the  two  compart-
ments  of  the  extracellular  fluid.  The  hydrostatic  pressure  within  the 
capillaries and the colloid oncotic pressure in the interstitial fluid pro-
mote the movement of water and diffusible solutes from plasma to the 
interstitium. This movement is most prominent at the arterial origin 
of  the  capillary  and  falls  progressively  with  the  decline  in  intracapil-
lary pressure and the rise in oncotic pressure toward the venular end. 
Fluid  is  returned  from  the  interstitial  space  into  the  vascular  system 
largely  through  the  lymphatic  system.  These  interchanges  of  fluids 
are  normally  balanced  so  that  the  volumes  of  the  intravascular  and 
interstitial compartments remain constant. However, a net movement 
of fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial spaces takes place and 
may be responsible for the development of edema under the following 
conditions:  (1)  an  increase  in  intracapillary  hydrostatic  pressure;  (2) 
inadequate lymphatic drainage; (3) reductions in the oncotic pressure 
in the plasma; (4) damage to the capillary endothelial barrier; and (5) 
increases in the oncotic pressure in the interstitial space.
 ■ REDUCTION OF EFFECTIVE ARTERIAL VOLUME
In many forms of edema, the effective arterial blood volume, a param-
eter  that  represents  the  filling  of  the  arterial  tree  and  that  effectively 
perfuses  the  tissues,  is  reduced.  Underfilling  of  the  arterial  tree  may 
be  caused  by  a  reduction  of  cardiac  output  and/or  systemic  vascular 
resistance, by the pooling of blood in the splanchnic veins (as in cir-
rhosis), and by hypoalbuminemia (Fig. 41-1A). As a consequence of 
this underfilling, a series of physiologic responses designed to restore 
the effective arterial volume to normal are set into motion. A key ele-
ment of these responses is the renal retention of sodium and, therefore, 
water, thereby restoring effective arterial volume, but sometimes also 
leading to the development or intensification of edema.
 ■ RENAL FACTORS AND THE RENIN- 
ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM
The diminished renal blood flow characteristic of states in which the 
effective  arterial  blood  volume  is  reduced  is  translated  by  the  renal 
juxtaglomerular  cells  (specialized  myoepithelial  cells  surrounding 
the afferent arteriole) into a signal for increased renin release. Renin 
is an enzyme with a molecular mass of about 40,000 Da that acts on 
its substrate, angiotensinogen, an α2-globulin synthesized by the liver, 
to release angiotensin I, a decapeptide, which in turn is converted to 
angiotensin II (AII), an octapeptide. AII has generalized vasoconstric-
tor properties, particularly on the renal efferent arterioles. This action 
reduces the hydrostatic pressure in the peritubular capillaries, whereas 
the increased filtration fraction raises the colloid osmotic pressure in 
these  vessels,  thereby  enhancing  salt  and  water  reabsorption  in  the 
proximal tubule as well as in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) operates as both a 
hormonal and paracrine system. Its activation causes sodium and water 
retention and thereby contributes to edema formation. Blockade of the 
conversion  of  angiotensin  I  to  AII  and  blockade  of  the  AII  receptors 
enhance sodium and water excretion and reduce many forms of edema. 
AII  that  enters  the  systemic  circulation  stimulates  the  production  of 
aldosterone by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone 
in  turn  enhances  sodium  reabsorption  (and  potassium  excretion)  by 
the  collecting  tubule,  further  favoring  edema  formation.  Blockade  of 
the action of aldosterone by spironolactone or eplerenone (aldosterone 
antagonists) or by amiloride (a blocker of epithelial sodium channels) 
often induces a moderate diuresis in edematous states.
 ■ ARGININE VASOPRESSIN
(See also Chap. 381) The secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by 
the posterior pituitary gland occurs in response to increased intracellu-
lar osmolar concentration; by stimulating V2 receptors, AVP increases 
the reabsorption of free water in the distal tubules and collecting ducts 
of  the  kidneys,  thereby  increasing  total-body  water.  Circulating  AVP 
is elevated in many patients with heart failure secondary to a nonos-
motic stimulus associated with decreased effective arterial volume and 
reduced compliance of the left atrium. Such patients fail to show the 
normal reduction of AVP with a reduction of osmolality, contributing 
to edema formation and hyponatremia.

closely  related  natriuretic  peptide  (pre-pro-
hormone  brain  natriuretic  peptide  [BNP]) 
is  stored  primarily  in  ventricular  myo-
cytes  and  is  released  when  ventricular  dia-
stolic  pressure  rises.  Released  ANP  and 
BNP  (which  is  derived  from  its  precur-
sor)  bind  to  the  natriuretic  receptor-A,  
which  causes  (1)  excretion  of  sodium  and 
water  by  augmenting  glomerular  filtration 
rate,  inhibiting  sodium  reabsorption  in  the 
proximal  tubule,  and  inhibiting  release  of 
renin  and  aldosterone;  and  (2)  dilation  of 
arterioles  and  venules  by  antagonizing  the 
vasoconstrictor actions of AII, AVP, and sym-
pathetic  stimulation.  Thus,  elevated  levels 
of  natriuretic  peptides  have  the  capacity  to 
oppose sodium retention in hypervolemic and 
edematous states.

Although  circulating  levels  of  ANP  and 
BNP  are  elevated  in  heart  failure  and  in  cir-
rhosis  with  ascites,  these  natriuretic  peptides 
are  not  sufficiently  potent  to  prevent  edema 
formation. Indeed, in edematous states, resis-
tance  to  the  actions  of  natriuretic  peptides 
may  be  increased,  further  reducing  their 
effectiveness.

Further discussion of the control of sodium 

and water balance is found in Chap. S1.
 ■ CLINICAL CAUSES OF EDEMA
A  weight  gain  of  several  kilograms  usually 
precedes  overt  manifestations  of  generalized 
edema.  Anasarca  refers  to  gross,  generalized 
edema.  Ascites  (Chap.  50)  and  hydrothorax 
refer  to  accumulation  of  excess  fluid  in  the 
peritoneal  and  pleural  cavities,  respectively, 
and are considered special forms of edema.

Edema  is  recognized  by  the  persistence 
of  an  indentation  of  the  skin  after  pressure 
known  as  “pitting”  edema.  In  its  more  sub-
tle  form,  edema  may  be  detected  by  noting 
that  after  the  stethoscope  is  removed  from 
the  chest  wall,  the  rim  of  the  bell  leaves  an 
indentation on the skin of the chest for a few 
minutes.  Edema  may  be  present  when  the 
ring on a finger fits more snugly than in the 
past or when a patient complains of difficulty 
putting on shoes, particularly in the evening. 
Edema may also be recognized by puffiness of 
the face, which is most readily apparent in the 
periorbital areas owing to relative tissue laxity.

FIGURE 41-1  Clinical conditions in which a decrease in cardiac output (A) and systemic vascular resistance 
(B) cause arterial underfilling with resulting neurohumoral activation and renal sodium and water retention. In 
addition to activating the neurohumoral axis, adrenergic stimulation causes renal vasoconstriction and enhances 
sodium and fluid transport by the proximal tubule epithelium. AVP, arginine vasopressin; RAAS, renin-angiotensin 
aldosterone system; SNS, sympathetic nervous system. (From Annals of Internal Medicine, RW Schrier: Body fluid

 ■ ENDOTHELIN-1
This potent peptide vasoconstrictor is released by endothelial cells. Its 
concentration  in  the  plasma  is  elevated  in  patients  with  severe  heart 
failure  and  contributes  to  renal  vasoconstriction,  sodium  retention, 
and edema.

 ■ NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES
Atrial distention causes release into the circulation of atrial natriuretic 
peptide  (ANP),  a  polypeptide.  A  high-molecular-weight  precursor 
of  ANP  is  stored  in  secretory  granules  within  atrial  myocytes.  A 

 ■ GENERALIZED EDEMA
The  differences  among  the  major  causes  of 
generalized  edema  are  shown  in  Table  41-1. 
Cardiac,  renal,  hepatic,  or  nutritional  dis-
orders  are  responsible  for  a  large  majority 
of  patients  with  generalized  edema.  Conse-
quently,  the  differential  diagnosis  of  general-
ized edema should be directed toward identifying or excluding these 
several conditions.
Heart Failure 
(See also Chap. 257) In heart failure, the impaired 
systolic  emptying  of  the  ventricle(s)  and/or  the  impairment  of  ven-
tricular relaxation promotes an accumulation of blood in the venous 
circulation at the expense of the effective arterial volume. In addition, 
the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the RAAS (see 
above) acts in concert to cause renal vasoconstriction and reduction of 
glomerular filtration and salt and water retention. Sodium and water 
retention continue, and the increment in blood volume accumulates in

the venous circulation, raising venous and intracapillary pressure and 
resulting in edema (Fig. 41-1).

The  presence  of  overt  cardiac  disease,  as  manifested  by  cardiac 
enlargement and/or ventricular hypertrophy, together with clinical evi-
dence of cardiac failure, such as dyspnea, basilar rales, venous disten-
tion, and hepatomegaly, usually indicates that edema results from heart 
failure. Noninvasive tests such as electrocardiography, echocardiogra-
phy, and measurements of BNP (or N-terminal proBNP [NT-proBNP]) 
are helpful in establishing the diagnosis of heart disease. The edema of 
heart failure typically occurs in the dependent portions of the body.
Edema of Renal Disease 
(See  also  Chap.  314)  The  edema  that 
occurs  during  the  acute  phase  of  glomerulonephritis  is  characteris-
tically  associated  with  hematuria,  proteinuria,  and  hypertension.  In 
most  instances,  the  edema  results  from  primary  retention  of  sodium 
and water by the kidneys owing to renal dysfunction. This state differs 
from most forms of heart failure in that it is characterized by a normal 
(or  sometimes  even  increased)  cardiac  output.  Patients  with  chronic 
renal failure may also develop edema due to primary renal retention 
of sodium and water.
Nephrotic  Syndrome  and  Other  Hypoalbuminemic 
States  The  primary  alteration  in  the  nephrotic  syndrome  is  a 
diminished  colloid  oncotic  pressure  due  to  losses  of  large  quantities 
(≥3.5  g/d)  of  protein  into  the  urine  and  hypoalbuminemia  (<3.0  g/
dL).  As  a  result  of  the  reduced  colloid  osmotic  pressure,  the  sodium 
and  water  that  are  retained  cannot  be  confined  within  the  vascular 
compartment,  and  total  and  effective  arterial  blood  volumes  decline. 
This process initiates the edema-forming sequence of events described 
above,  including  activation  of  the  RAAS.  The  nephrotic  syndrome 
may occur during the course of a variety of kidney diseases, including 
glomerulonephritis,  diabetic  glomerulosclerosis,  and  hypersensitivity 
reactions. The edema is diffuse, symmetric, and most prominent in the 
dependent areas; periorbital edema is most prominent in the morning.

Hepatic Cirrhosis 
(See also Chap. 344) This condition is charac-
terized, in part, by hepatic venous outflow obstruction, which in turn 
expands the splanchnic blood volume, and hepatic lymph formation. 
Intrahepatic hypertension acts as a stimulus for renal sodium retention 
and causes a reduction of effective arterial blood volume. These alterations 
are frequently complicated by hypoalbuminemia secondary to reduced 
hepatic  synthesis,  as  well  as  peripheral  arterial  vasodilation.  These 
effects reduce the effective arterial blood volume, leading to activation 

of  the  sodium-  and  water-retaining  mechanisms  described  above  
(Fig. 41-1B). The concentration of circulating aldosterone often is ele-
vated by the failure of the liver to metabolize this hormone. Initially, the 
excess interstitial fluid is localized preferentially proximal (upstream) 
to  the  congested  portal  venous  system,  causing  ascites  (Chap.  50). 
In  later  stages,  particularly  when  there  is  severe  hypoalbuminemia, 
peripheral edema may develop. A sizable accumulation of ascitic fluid 
may increase intraabdominal pressure and impede venous return from 
the lower extremities and contribute to the accumulation of the edema.

Drug-Induced Edema  A large number of widely used drugs can 
cause edema (Table 41-2). Mechanisms include renal vasoconstriction

(nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  and  cyclosporine),  arteriolar 
dilation (vasodilators), augmented renal sodium reabsorption (steroid 
hormones), and capillary damage.

Edema  of  Nutritional  Origin  A  diet  grossly  deficient  in  calo-
ries and particularly in protein over a prolonged period may produce 
hypoproteinemia  and  edema.  The  latter  may  be  intensified  by  the 
development  of  beriberi  heart  disease,  which  also  is  of  nutritional 
origin,  in  which  multiple  peripheral  arteriovenous  fistulae  result  in 
reduced  effective  systemic  perfusion  and  effective  arterial  blood  vol-
ume,  thereby  enhancing  edema  formation  (Chap.  333)  (Fig.  41-1B). 
Edema  develops  or  becomes  intensified  when  famished  subjects  are 
first provided with an adequate diet. The ingestion of more food may 
increase the quantity of sodium ingested, which is then retained along 
with water. So-called refeeding edema also may be linked to increased 
release  of  insulin,  which  directly  increases  tubular  sodium  reabsorp-
tion. In addition to hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia and caloric defi-
cits may be involved in the edema of starvation.

 ■ LOCALIZED EDEMA
In thrombophlebitis, varicose veins, and primary venous valve failure, 
the  hydrostatic  pressure  in  the  capillary  bed  upstream  (proximal)  of 
the obstruction increases so that an abnormal quantity of fluid is trans-
ferred from the vascular to the interstitial space, which may give rise 
to localized edema. The latter may also occur in lymphatic obstruction 
caused  by  chronic  lymphangitis,  resection  of  regional  lymph  nodes, 
filariasis,  and  genetic  (frequently  called  primary)  lymphedema.  The 
latter  is  particularly  intractable  because  restriction  of  lymphatic  flow 
results  in  both  an  increase  in  intracapillary  pressure  and  increased 
protein concentration in the interstitial fluid, which act in concert to 
aggravate fluid retention.

Other  Causes  of  Edema  These  causes  include  hypothyroidism 
(myxedema)  due  to  deposition  of  hyaluronic  acid;  hyperthyroidism 
(pretibial  myxedema  secondary  to  Graves’  disease),  in  which  edema 
is typically nonpitting and, in Graves’ disease, exogenous hypercorti-
solism;  pregnancy;  and  administration  of  estrogens  and  vasodilators, 
particularly dihydropyridines such as nifedipine.

 ■ DISTRIBUTION OF EDEMA
The distribution of edema is an important guide to its cause. Edema 
associated with heart failure tends to be more extensive in the legs and 
to be accentuated in the evening, a feature also determined largely by 
posture. When patients with heart failure are confined to bed, edema 
may be most prominent in the presacral region.

Edema resulting from hypoproteinemia, as occurs in the nephrotic 
syndrome, characteristically is generalized, but it is especially evident 
in the very soft tissues of the eyelids and face and tends to be most pro-
nounced in the morning owing to the recumbent posture assumed dur-
ing the night. Less common causes of facial edema include trichinosis, 
allergic reactions, and myxedema. Edema limited to one leg or to one 
or both arms is usually the result of venous and/or lymphatic obstruc-
tion.  Unilateral  paralysis  reduces  lymphatic  and  venous  drainage  on 
the affected side and may also be responsible for unilateral edema. In 
patients with obstruction of the superior vena cava, edema is confined 
to the face, neck, and upper extremities in which the venous pressure 
is elevated compared with that in the lower extremities.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Edema

An  important  first  question  is  whether  the  edema  is  localized  or 
generalized.  If  it  is  localized,  the  local  phenomena  that  may  be 
responsible  should  be  identified.  If  the  edema  is  generalized,  one 
should determine if there is serious hypoalbuminemia, e.g., serum 
albumin <3.0 g/dL. If so, the history, physical examination, urinal-
ysis,  and  other  laboratory  data  will  help  evaluate  the  question  of 
cirrhosis,  severe  malnutrition,  or  the  nephrotic  syndrome  as  the 

underlying disorder. If hypoalbuminemia is not present, it should 
be determined if there is evidence of heart failure severe enough to 
promote generalized edema. Finally, it should be ascertained as to 
whether or not the patient has an adequate urine output or if there 
is significant oliguria or anuria. These abnormalities are discussed 
in Chaps. 52, 310, and 311.

42 Approach to the Patient  
with a Heart Murmur
Patrick T. O’Gara, Joseph Loscalzo

The  differential  diagnosis  of  a  heart  murmur  begins  with  a  careful 
assessment of its major attributes and response to bedside maneuvers. 
The  history,  clinical  context,  and  associated  physical  examination 
findings provide additional clues to help establish the significance of a 
heart murmur. Accurate bedside identification of a heart murmur can 
inform decisions regarding the indications for noninvasive testing and 
the need for referral to a cardiovascular specialist. Preliminary discus-
sions  can  be  held  with  the  patient  regarding  antibiotic  or  rheumatic 
fever prophylaxis, the need to restrict various forms of physical activity, 
and the potential role for family screening.

Heart  murmurs  are  caused  by  audible  vibrations  that  are  due  to 
increased turbulence from accelerated blood flow through normal or 
abnormal  orifices;  flow  through  a  narrowed  or  irregular  orifice  into 
a  dilated  vessel  or  chamber;  or  backward  flow  through  an  incom-
petent  valve,  ventricular  septal  defect,  or  patent  ductus  arteriosus. 
They traditionally are defined by their timing within the cardiac cycle  
(Fig. 42-1). Systolic murmurs begin with or after the first heart sound 
(S1) and terminate at or before the component (A2 or P2) of the second 
heart  sound  (S2)  that  corresponds  to  their  site  of  origin  (left  or  right, 
respectively). Diastolic murmurs begin with or after the associated com-
ponent of S2 and end at or before the subsequent S1. Continuous murmurs 
are  not  confined  to  either  phase  of  the  cardiac  cycle  but  instead  begin 
in early systole and proceed through S2 into all or part of diastole. The 
accurate timing of heart murmurs is the first step in their identification. 
The distinction between S1 and S2, and therefore systole and diastole, is 
usually a straightforward process but can be difficult in the setting of a 
tachyarrhythmia,  in  which  case  the  heart  sounds  can  be  distinguished 
by simultaneous palpation of the carotid upstroke, which should closely 
follow S1.
Duration and Character  The duration of a heart murmur depends 
on the length of time over which a pressure difference exists between 
two cardiac chambers, the left ventricle and the aorta, the right ventri-
cle and the pulmonary artery, or the great vessels. The magnitude and

variability of this pressure difference, coupled with the geometry and 
compliance of the involved chambers or vessels, dictate the velocity of 
flow;  the  degree  of  turbulence;  and  the  resulting  frequency,  configu-
ration, and intensity of the murmur. The diastolic murmur of chronic 
aortic regurgitation (AR) is a blowing, high-frequency event, whereas 
the  murmur  of  mitral  stenosis  (MS),  indicative  of  the  left  atrial–left 
ventricular diastolic pressure gradient, is a low-frequency event, heard 
as a rumbling sound with the bell of the stethoscope. The frequency 
components of a heart murmur may vary at different sites of auscul-
tation. The coarse systolic murmur of aortic stenosis (AS) may sound 
higher pitched and more acoustically pure at the apex, a phenomenon 
eponymously referred to as the Gallavardin effect. Some murmurs may 
have a distinct or unusual quality, such as the “honking” sound appre-
ciated in some patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) due to mitral 
valve prolapse (MVP).

The  configuration  of  a  heart  murmur  may  be  described  as  cre-
scendo,  decrescendo,  crescendo-decrescendo,  or  plateau.  The  decre-
scendo configuration of the murmur of chronic AR (Fig. 42-1E) can be 
understood in terms of the progressive decline in the diastolic pressure 
gradient  between  the  aorta  and  the  left  ventricle.  The  crescendo- 
decrescendo configuration of the murmur of AS reflects the changes in 
the systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta 
as ejection occurs, whereas the plateau configuration of the murmur of 
chronic MR (Fig. 42-1B) is consistent with the large and nearly con-
stant pressure difference between the left ventricle and the left atrium.

JB Barlow: Perspectives on the Mitral Valve. Philadelphia, FA Davis, 1987, p 140.)

Intensity  The intensity of a heart murmur is graded on a scale of 
1–6 (or I–VI). A grade 1 murmur is very soft and is heard only with 
great effort. A grade 2 murmur is easily heard but not particularly loud. 
A grade 3 murmur is loud but is not accompanied by a palpable thrill 
over the site of maximal intensity. A grade 4 murmur is very loud and 
accompanied by a thrill. A grade 5 murmur is loud enough to be heard 
with  only  the  edge  of  the  stethoscope  touching  the  chest,  whereas  a 
grade  6  murmur  is  loud  enough  to  be  heard  with  the  stethoscope 
slightly off the chest. Murmurs of grade 3 or greater intensity usually 
signify important structural heart disease and indicate high blood flow 
velocity at the site of murmur production. Small, restrictive ventricular 
septal defects (VSDs), for example, are accompanied by loud, usually 
grade 4 or greater, systolic murmurs as blood is ejected at high velocity 
from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. Low-velocity events, such 
as left-to-right shunting across an atrial septal defect (ASD), are usually 
silent. The intensity of a heart murmur may be diminished by any pro-
cess that increases the distance between the intracardiac source and the 
stethoscope on the chest wall, such as obesity, obstructive lung disease, 
or a large pericardial effusion. The intensity of a murmur also may be 
misleadingly soft when cardiac output is reduced significantly or when 
the pressure gradient between the involved cardiac structures is low.

Location  and  Radiation  Recognition  of  the  location  and 
radiation  of  the  murmur  helps  facilitate  its  accurate  identification  
(Fig.  42-2).  Adventitious  sounds,  such  as  a  systolic  click  or  diastolic 
snap, or abnormalities of S1 or S2 may provide additional clues. Careful 
attention to the characteristics of the murmur and other heart sounds 
during  the  respiratory  cycle  and  the  performance  of  simple  bedside 
maneuvers  complete  the  auscultatory  examination.  These  features, 
along with recommendations for further testing, are discussed below 
in the context of specific systolic, diastolic, and continuous heart mur-
murs (Table 42-1).
 ■ SYSTOLIC HEART MURMURS
Early  Systolic  Murmurs  Early  systolic  murmurs  begin  with  S1 
and  extend  for  a  variable  period,  ending  well  before  S2.  Their  causes 
are relatively few. Acute, severe MR into a normal-sized, relatively non-
compliant left atrium results in an early, decrescendo systolic murmur 
best heard at or just medial to the apical impulse. These characteristics 
reflect  the  progressive  attenuation  of  the  pressure  gradient  between 
the left ventricle and the left atrium during systole owing to the rapid 
rise  in  left  atrial  pressure  caused  by  the  sudden  volume  load  into  an 
unprepared,  noncompliant  chamber,  and  contrast  sharply  with  the 
auscultatory features of chronic MR. Clinical settings in which acute, 
severe  MR  occur  include  (1)  papillary  muscle  rupture  complicating 
acute myocardial infarction (MI) (Chap. 275), (2) rupture of chordae 
tendineae  in  the  setting  of  myxomatous  mitral  valve  disease  (MVP, 
Chap. 265), (3) infective endocarditis (Chap. 128), and (4) blunt chest 
wall trauma.

Acute,  severe  MR  from  papillary  muscle  rupture  usually  accom-
panies  an  inferior,  posterior,  or  lateral  MI  and  occurs  2–7  days  after 
presentation. It often is signaled by chest pain, hypotension, and pul-
monary edema, but a murmur may be absent in up to 50% of cases. The 
posteromedial papillary muscle is involved 6–10 times more frequently 
than  the  anterolateral  papillary  muscle.  The  murmur  is  to  be  distin-
guished from that associated with post-MI ventricular septal rupture, 
which is accompanied by a systolic thrill at the left sternal border in 
nearly  all  patients  and  is  holosystolic  in  duration.  A  new  heart  mur-
mur  after  an  MI  is  an  indication  for  transthoracic  echocardiography 
(TTE)  (Chap.  241),  which  allows  bedside  delineation  of  its  etiology 
and pathophysiologic significance. The distinction between acute MR 
and  ventricular  septal  rupture  also  can  be  achieved  with  right-sided 
heart catheterization, sequential determination of oxygen saturations, 
and analysis of the pressure waveforms (tall v wave in the pulmonary 
artery  wedge  pressure  in  MR).  Post-MI  mechanical  complications  of 
this nature mandate aggressive medical stabilization and prompt refer-
ral for surgical repair.

Spontaneous  chordal  rupture  can  complicate  the  course  of  
myxomatous  mitral  valve  disease  (MVP)  and  result  in  new-onset  or 
“acute  on  chronic”  severe  MR.  MVP  may  occur  as  an  isolated  phe-
nomenon, or the lesion may be part of a more generalized connective 
tissue disorder as seen, for example, in patients with Marfan syndrome. 
Acute,  severe  MR  as  a  consequence  of  infective  endocarditis  results 
from destruction of leaflet tissue, chordal rupture, or both. Blunt chest 
wall trauma is usually self-evident but may be disarmingly trivial; it can 
result in papillary muscle contusion and rupture, chordal detachment, 
or  leaflet  avulsion.  TTE  is  indicated  in  all  cases  of  suspected  acute, 
severe MR to define its mechanism and severity, delineate left ventric-
ular size and systolic function, and provide an assessment of suitability 
for primary valve repair.

A congenital, small muscular VSD (Chap. 269) may be associated 
with an early systolic murmur. The defect closes progressively during 
septal contraction, and thus the murmur is confined to early systole. It 
is localized to the left sternal border (Fig. 42-2) and is usually of grade 
4  or  5  intensity.  Signs  of  pulmonary  hypertension  or  left  ventricular 
volume overload are absent. Anatomically large and uncorrected VSDs, 
which  usually  involve  the  membranous  portion  of  the  septum,  may 
lead  to  pulmonary  hypertension.  The  murmur  associated  with  the 
left-to-right shunt, which earlier may have been holosystolic, becomes 
limited to the first portion of systole as the elevated pulmonary vascu-
lar resistance leads to an abrupt rise in right ventricular pressure and 
an  attenuation  of  the  interventricular  pressure  gradient  during  the 
remainder of the cardiac cycle. In such instances, signs of pulmonary 
hypertension (right ventricular lift, loud and single or closely split S2) 
may predominate. The murmur is best heard along the left sternal bor-
der but is softer. Suspicion of a VSD is an indication for TTE.

Tricuspid  regurgitation  (TR)  with  normal  pulmonary  artery  pres-
sures, as may occur with infective endocarditis, may produce an early 
systolic murmur. The murmur is soft (grade 1 or 2), is best heard at the 
lower left sternal border, and may increase in intensity with inspiration 
(Carvallo’s  sign).  Regurgitant c-v  waves  may  be  visible  in  the  jugular 
venous  pulse.  TR  in  this  setting  is  not  associated  with  signs  of  right 
heart failure, such as ascites or lower extremity edema.

Midsystolic  Murmurs  Midsystolic  murmurs  begin  at  a  short 
interval after S1, end before S2 (Fig. 42-1C) and are usually crescendo-
decrescendo  in  configuration.  AS  is  the  most  common  cause  of  a 
midsystolic murmur in an adult. The murmur of AS is usually loudest 
to the right of the sternum in the second intercostal space (aortic area, 
Fig. 42-2) and radiates into the carotids. Transmission of the midsys-
tolic murmur to the apex, where it becomes higher-pitched, is common 
(Gallavardin effect; see above).

Differentiation of this apical systolic murmur from MR can be diffi-
cult. The murmur of AS will increase in intensity or become louder, in 
the beat after a premature beat, whereas the murmur of MR will have 
constant intensity from beat to beat. The intensity of the AS murmur 
also  varies  directly  with  the  cardiac  output.  With  a  normal  cardiac 
output,  a  systolic  thrill  at  the  second  right  intercostal  space  and  a

grade 4 or higher murmur suggest severe AS. The murmur is softer in 
the setting of heart failure and low cardiac output. Other auscultatory 
findings of severe AS include a soft or absent A2, paradoxical splitting 
of  S2,  an  apical  S4,  and  a  late-peaking  systolic  murmur.  In  children, 
adolescents,  and  young  adults  with  congenital  valvular  AS,  an  early 
ejection sound (click) is usually audible, more often along the left ster-
nal border than at the base. Its presence signifies a flexible, noncalcified 
bicuspid valve (or one of its variants) and localizes the left ventricular 
outflow obstruction to the valvular (rather than sub- or supravalvular)  
level.

Assessment of the volume and rate of rise of the carotid pulse can 
provide additional information. A small and delayed upstroke (parvus 
et tardus) is consistent with severe AS. The carotid pulse examination 
is less discriminatory, however, in older patients with stiffened arteries. 
The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows signs of left ventricular hypertro-
phy (LVH) as the severity of the stenosis increases. TTE is indicated 
to assess the anatomic features of the aortic valve, the severity of the 
stenosis, left ventricular size, wall thickness and function, and the size 
and contour of the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta.

The  obstructive  form  of  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  (HOCM) 
is associated with a midsystolic murmur that is usually loudest along 
the  left  sternal  border  or  between  the  left  lower  sternal  border  and 
the  apex  (Chap.  259,  Fig.  42-2).  The  murmur  is  produced  by  both 
dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and MR, and thus, 
its  configuration  is  a  hybrid  between  ejection  and  regurgitant  phe-
nomena. The intensity of the murmur may vary from beat to beat and 
after provocative maneuvers but usually does not exceed grade 3. The 
murmur classically will increase in intensity with maneuvers that result 
in increasing degrees of outflow tract obstruction, such as a reduction 
in  preload  or  afterload  (Valsalva,  standing,  vasodilators),  or  with  an 
augmentation  of  contractility  (inotropic  stimulation).  Maneuvers 
or  medications  that  increase  preload  (squatting,  passive  leg  raising, 
volume administration) or afterload (squatting, vasopressors) or that 
reduce contractility (β-adrenoreceptor blockers) decrease the intensity 
of the murmur. In rare patients, there may be reversed splitting of S2. A 
sustained left ventricular apical impulse and an S4 may be appreciated. 
In contrast to AS, the carotid upstroke is rapid and of normal volume. 
Rarely, it is bisferiens or bifid in contour (see Fig. 239-2D) due to mid-
systolic closure of the aortic valve. LVH is present on the ECG, and the 
diagnosis is confirmed by TTE. Although the systolic murmur associ-
ated with MVP behaves similarly to that due to HOCM in response to 
the Valsalva maneuver and to standing/squatting (Fig. 42-3), these two 
lesions can be distinguished on the basis of their associated findings, 
such as the presence of LVH in HOCM or a nonejection click in MVP.
The midsystolic, crescendo-decrescendo murmur of congenital pul-
monic  stenosis  (PS;  Chap.  269)  is  best  appreciated  in  the  second  and 
third left intercostal spaces (pulmonic area) (Figs. 42-2 and 42-4). The 
duration  of  the  murmur  lengthens  and  the  intensity  of  P2  diminishes 
with increasing degrees of valvular stenosis (Fig. 42-1D). An early ejec-
tion  sound,  the  intensity  of  which  decreases  with  inspiration,  is  heard 
in  younger  patients.  A  parasternal  lift  and  ECG  evidence  of  right 
ventricular hypertrophy indicate severe pressure overload. If obtained, 
the chest x-ray may show poststenotic dilation of the main pulmonary 
artery. TTE is recommended for complete characterization.

Significant left-to-right intracardiac shunting due to an ASD (Chap. 
269)  leads  to  an  increase  in  pulmonary  blood  flow  and  a  grade  2–3 
midsystolic murmur at the middle to upper left sternal border attrib-
uted  to  increased  flow  rates  across  the  pulmonic  valve  with  fixed 
splitting of S2. Ostium secundum ASDs are the most common cause of 
these shunts in adults. Features suggestive of a primum ASD include 
the coexistence of MR due to a cleft anterior mitral valve leaflet and 
left axis deviation of the QRS complex on the ECG. With sinus venosus 
ASDs, the left-to-right shunt is usually not large enough to result in a 
systolic murmur, although the ECG may show abnormalities of sinus 
node function. A grade 2 or 3 midsystolic murmur may also be heard 
best at the upper left sternal border in patients with idiopathic dilation 
of the pulmonary artery; a pulmonary ejection sound is also present in 
these patients. TTE is indicated to evaluate a grade 2 or 3 midsystolic 
murmur when there are other signs of cardiac disease.

FIGURE 42-3  A midsystolic nonejection sound (C) occurs in mitral valve prolapse 
and is followed by a late systolic murmur that crescendos to the second heart sound 
(S2). Standing decreases venous return; the heart becomes smaller; C moves closer 
to the first heart sound (S1), and the mitral regurgitant murmur has an earlier onset. 
With prompt squatting, venous return and afterload increase; the heart becomes 
larger; C moves toward S2; and the duration of the murmur shortens. The systolic 
murmur of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy behaves similarly. (Reprinted

©American Heart Association,  Inc.)

An isolated grade 1 or 2 midsystolic murmur, heard in the absence 
of symptoms or signs of heart disease, is most often a benign finding 
for which no further evaluation, including TTE, is necessary. The most 
common example of a murmur of this type in an older adult patient 
is the crescendo-decrescendo murmur of aortic valve sclerosis, heard 
at  the  second  right  interspace  (Fig.  42-2).  Aortic  sclerosis  is  defined 
as  focal  thickening  and  calcification  of  the  aortic  valve  to  a  degree 
that does not interfere with leaflet opening. The carotid upstrokes are 
normal, and electrocardiographic LVH is not present. A grade 1 or 2 
midsystolic murmur often can be heard at the left sternal border with 
pregnancy,  hyperthyroidism,  or  anemia,  physiologic  states  that  are 
associated with accelerated blood flow. Still’s murmur refers to a benign 
grade 2, vibratory or musical midsystolic murmur at the mid or lower 
left sternal border in normal children and adolescents, best heard in the 
supine position (Fig. 42-2).

Late Systolic Murmurs  A late systolic murmur that is best heard 
at the left ventricular apex is usually due to MVP (Chap. 265). Often, 
this  murmur  is  introduced  by  one  or  more  nonejection  clicks.  The 
radiation  of  the  murmur  can  help  identify  the  specific  mitral  leaflet 
involved in the process of prolapse or flail. The term flail refers to the 
movement  made  by  an  unsupported  portion  of  the  leaflet  (usually 
the  tip)  after  loss  of  its  chordal  attachment(s).  With  posterior  leaflet 
prolapse  or  flail,  the  resultant  jet  of  MR  is  directed  anteriorly  and 
medially, as a result of which the murmur radiates to the base of the 
heart and masquerades as AS. Anterior leaflet prolapse or flail results 
in a posteriorly directed MR jet that radiates to the axilla or left infras-
capular region. Leaflet flail is associated with a murmur of grade 3 or 4 
intensity that can be heard throughout the precordium in thin-chested 
patients. The presence of an S3 or a short, rumbling mid-diastolic mur-
mur due to enhanced flow signifies severe MR.

FIGURE  42-4  Left.  In  valvular  pulmonic  stenosis  with  intact  ventricular  septum, 
right  ventricular  systolic  ejection  becomes  progressively  longer,  with  increasing 
obstruction to flow. As a result, the murmur becomes longer and louder, enveloping 
the  aortic  component  of  the  second  heart  sound  (A2).  The  pulmonic  component 
(P2)  occurs  later,  and  splitting  becomes  wider  but  more  difficult  to  hear  because 
A2 is lost in the murmur and P2 becomes progressively fainter and lower pitched. 
As the pulmonic gradient increases, the isometric contraction phase shortens until 
the pulmonic valve ejection sound fuses with the first heart sound (S1). In severe 
pulmonic  stenosis  with  concentric  hypertrophy  and  decreasing  right  ventricular 
compliance,  a  fourth  heart  sound  appears.  Right.  In  tetralogy  of  Fallot  with 
increasing obstruction at the pulmonic infundibular area, an increasing amount of 
right  ventricular  blood  is  shunted  across  the  silent  ventricular  septal  defect  and 
flow  across  the  obstructed  outflow  tract  decreases.  Therefore,  with  increasing 
obstruction, the murmur becomes shorter, earlier, and fainter. P2 is absent in severe 
tetralogy of Fallot. A large aortic root receives almost all cardiac output from both 
ventricular chambers, and the aorta dilates and is accompanied by a root ejection 
sound that does not vary with respiration. (Reprinted with permission Examination  
of  the  Heart,  Part  IV:  Auscultation  of  the  Heart  ©American  Heart  Association,  
Inc.)

Bedside  maneuvers  that  decrease  left  ventricular  preload,  such  as 
standing,  will  cause  the  click  and  murmur  of  MVP  to  move  closer 
to  the  first  heart  sound,  as  leaflet  prolapse  occurs  earlier  in  systole. 
Standing also causes the murmur to become louder and longer. With 
squatting, left ventricular preload and afterload are increased abruptly, 
leading  to  an  increase  in  left  ventricular  volume,  and  the  click  and 
murmur  move  away  from  the  first  heart  sound  as  leaflet  prolapse 
is  delayed;  the  murmur  becomes  softer  and  shorter  in  duration  
(Fig. 42-3). As noted above, these responses to standing and squatting 
are directionally similar to those observed in patients with HOCM.

A late, apical systolic murmur indicative of MR may be heard tran-
siently in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia; it is due to apical 
tethering  and  malcoaptation  of  the  leaflets  in  response  to  structural 
and functional changes of the ventricle and mitral annulus. The inten-
sity of the murmur varies as a function of left ventricular afterload and 
will increase in the setting of hypertension. TTE is recommended for 
assessment of late systolic murmurs.

Holosystolic Murmurs 
(Figs. 42-1B and 42-5) Holosystolic mur-
murs begin with S1 and continue through systole to S2. They are usu-
ally  indicative  of  chronic  mitral  or  tricuspid  valve  regurgitation  or  a 
VSD  and  warrant  TTE  for  further  characterization.  The  holosystolic 
murmur of chronic MR is best heard at the left ventricular apex and 
radiates to the axilla (Fig. 42-2); it is usually high-pitched and plateau 
in  configuration  because  of  the  wide  difference  between  left  ventric-
ular  and  left  atrial  pressure  throughout  systole.  In  contrast  to  acute 
MR, left atrial compliance is normal or even increased in chronic MR. 
As a result, there is only a small increase in left atrial pressure for any 
increase in regurgitant volume.

Several  conditions  are  associated  with  chronic  MR  and  an  apical 
holosystolic  murmur,  including  rheumatic  scarring  of  the  leaflets, 
mitral annular calcification, postinfarction left ventricular remodeling, 
and  severe  left  ventricular  chamber  enlargement  in  the  setting  of  a 
dilated cardiomyopathy (Chap. 259). The severity of the MR is wors-
ened  by  any  contribution  from  apical  displacement  of  the  papillary 
muscles and leaflet tethering (remodeling). Because the mitral annulus 
is  contiguous  with  the  left  atrial  endocardium,  gradual  enlargement 
of the left atrium from chronic MR will result in further stretching of 
the annulus and more MR; thus, “MR begets MR.” Chronic severe MR 
results in enlargement and leftward displacement of the left ventricular

FIGURE 42-5  Differential diagnosis of a holosystolic murmur. The murmur of mitral regurgitation is best heard over the left ventricular apex. The radiation of the murmur 
depends on the direction in which the jet of mitral regurgitation enters into the left atrium. Differentiation of primary and secondary causes of mitral regurgitation is usually 
accomplished with transthoracic echocardiography, although the presence of a nonejection click and a mid-late apical systolic murmur, for example, can establish a 
bedside diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse (primary mitral regurgitation). Secondary mitral regurgitation can occur as a result of left ventricular remodeling. The murmur 
may be soft and difficult to hear. Other signs of left ventricular dysfunction may be present. Greater than 80% of the tricuspid regurgitation encountered clinically is due to 
a secondary cause. Severe pulmonary hypertension can be appreciated by a loud, single P2. Primary tricuspid regurgitation may be present in the setting of pacemaker 
leads or in patients with carcinoid syndrome who usually have signs of liver involvement. A ventricular septal defect is usually manifested by a holosystolic murmur with a 
palpable thrill along the mid- to lower left sternal edge.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesapex beat and, in some patients, a diastolic filling complex, as described 
previously (Fig. 42-1G).

The holosystolic murmur of chronic TR is generally softer than that 
of MR, is loudest at the left lower sternal border, and usually increases 
in intensity with inspiration (Carvallo’s sign). Associated signs include 
c-v waves in the jugular venous pulse, an enlarged and pulsatile liver, 
ascites, and peripheral edema. The abnormal jugular venous waveforms 
are the predominant finding and seen very often in the absence of an 
audible murmur despite Doppler echocardiographic verification of TR. 
Causes of primary TR include myxomatous disease (prolapse), endo-
carditis,  rheumatic  disease,  radiation,  carcinoid,  Ebstein’s  anomaly, 
leaflet trauma due to intracardiac device leads, or chordal detachment 
as  a  complication  of  right  ventricular  endomyocardial  biopsy.  TR  is 
much more commonly a passive process that results secondarily from 
annular  enlargement  due  to  right  ventricular  dilation  in  the  face  of 
volume or pressure overload or adverse right ventricular remodeling.

The holosystolic murmur of a VSD is loudest at the mid- to lower- 
left  sternal  border  (Fig.  42-2)  and  radiates  widely.  A  thrill  is  present 
at the site of maximal intensity in the majority of patients. There is no 
change in the intensity of the murmur with inspiration. The intensity 
of the murmur varies as a function of the anatomic size of the defect. 
Small, restrictive VSDs, as exemplified by the maladie de Roger, create a 
very loud murmur due to the significant and sustained systolic pressure 
gradient between the left and right ventricles. With large defects, the 
ventricular  pressures  tend  to  equalize,  shunt  flow  is  balanced,  and  a 
murmur is not appreciated. The distinction between post-MI ventricu-
lar septal rupture and MR has been reviewed previously.

 ■ DIASTOLIC HEART MURMURS
Early  Diastolic  Murmurs 
(Fig.  42-1E)  Chronic  AR  results  in  a 
high-pitched,  blowing,  decrescendo,  early-  to  mid-diastolic  murmur 
that begins after the aortic component of S2 (A2) and is best heard at the 
second right interspace and along the left sternal border. The murmur 
may be soft and difficult to hear unless auscultation is performed with 
the patient leaning forward at end expiration. This maneuver brings the 
aortic root closer to the anterior chest wall. Radiation of the murmur 
may provide a clue to the cause of the AR. With primary valve disease, 
such as that due to congenital bicuspid disease, prolapse, or endocardi-
tis, the diastolic murmur tends to radiate along the left sternal border, 
where it is often louder than appreciated in the second right interspace. 
When AR is caused by aortic root disease, the diastolic murmur may 
radiate along the right sternal border. Diseases of the aortic root cause 
dilation or distortion of the aortic annulus and failure of leaflet coap-
tation.  Causes  include  Marfan  syndrome  with  aneurysm  formation, 
annuloaortic ectasia, ankylosing spondylitis, and aortic dissection.

Chronic, severe AR also may produce a lower-pitched mid to late, 
grade  1  or  2  diastolic  murmur  at  the  apex  (Austin  Flint  murmur), 
which is thought to reflect turbulence at the mitral inflow area from 
the admixture of regurgitant (aortic) and forward (mitral) blood flow. 
This lower-pitched, apical diastolic murmur can be distinguished from 
that  due  to  MS  by  the  absence  of  an  opening  snap  and  the  response 
of the murmur to a vasodilator challenge. Lowering afterload with an 
agent  such  as  amyl  nitrite  will  decrease  the  duration  and  magnitude 
of the aortic–left ventricular diastolic pressure gradient, and thus, the 
Austin Flint murmur of severe AR will become shorter and softer. The 
intensity of the diastolic murmur of MS (Fig. 42-6) may either remain 
constant  or  increase  with  afterload  reduction  because  of  the  reflex 
increase in cardiac output and mitral valve flow.

Although  AS  and  AR  may  coexist,  a  grade  2  or  3  crescendo- 
decrescendo midsystolic murmur frequently is heard at the base of the 
heart  in  patients  with  isolated,  severe  AR  and  is  due  to  an  increased 
volume  and  rate  of  systolic  flow.  Accurate  bedside  identification  of 
coexistent AS can be difficult unless the carotid pulse examination is 
abnormal or the midsystolic murmur is of grade 4 or greater intensity. 
In the absence of heart failure, chronic severe AR is accompanied by 
several peripheral signs of significant diastolic runoff, including a wide 
pulse pressure, a “water-hammer” carotid upstroke (Corrigan’s pulse), 
and  Quincke’s  pulsations  of  the  nail  beds.  The  diastolic  murmur  of

FIGURE  42-6  Diastolic  filling  murmur  (rumble)  in  mitral  stenosis.  In  mild  mitral 
stenosis,  the  diastolic  gradient  across  the  valve  is  limited  to  the  phases  of  rapid 
ventricular  filling  in  early  diastole  and  presystole.  The  rumble  may  occur  during 
either or both periods. As the stenotic process becomes severe, a large pressure 
gradient  exists  across  the  valve  during  the  entire  diastolic  filling  period,  and  the 
rumble persists throughout diastole. As the left atrial pressure becomes greater, the 
interval between A2 (or P2) and the opening snap (O.S.) shortens. In severe mitral 
stenosis,  secondary  pulmonary  hypertension  develops  and  results  in  a  loud  P2 
and the splitting interval usually narrows. ECG, electrocardiogram. (Reprinted with

acute, severe AR is notably shorter in duration and lower pitched than 
the murmur of chronic AR. It can be very difficult to appreciate in the 
presence of a rapid heart rate. These attributes reflect the abrupt rate 
of rise of diastolic pressure within the unprepared and noncompliant 
left ventricle and the correspondingly rapid decline in the aortic–left 
ventricular diastolic pressure gradient. Left ventricular diastolic pres-
sure  may  increase  sufficiently  to  result  in  premature  closure  of  the 
mitral valve and a soft first heart sound. Peripheral signs of significant 
diastolic runoff are generally not present.

Pulmonic  regurgitation  (PR)  results  in  a  decrescendo,  early  to 
mid-diastolic  murmur  (Graham  Steell  murmur)  that  begins  after  the 
pulmonic component of S2 (P2), is best heard at the second left inter-
space,  and  radiates  along  the  left  sternal  border.  The  intensity  of  the 
murmur may increase with inspiration. PR is most commonly due to 
dilation of the valve annulus from chronic elevation of the pulmonary 
artery  pressure.  Signs  of  pulmonary  hypertension,  including  a  right 
ventricular lift and a loud, single or narrowly split S2, are present. These 
features also help distinguish PR from AR as the cause of a decrescendo 
diastolic murmur heard along the left sternal border. PR in the absence 
of pulmonary hypertension can occur with endocarditis or a congen-
itally deformed valve. It is usually present after repair of tetralogy of 
Fallot in childhood. When pulmonary hypertension is not present, the 
diastolic murmur is softer and lower pitched than the classic Graham 
Steell murmur, and the severity of the PR can be difficult to appreciate.
TTE is indicated for the further evaluation of a patient with an early 
to  mid-diastolic  murmur.  Longitudinal  assessment  of  lesion  severity, 
ventricular size, and systolic function helps guide a potential decision 
for surgical management. TTE also can provide anatomic information 
regarding the root and proximal ascending aorta, although computed 
tomographic or magnetic resonance angiography may be indicated for 
more precise characterization (Chap. 241).

Mid-Diastolic  Murmurs 
(Figs.  42-1F  and  42-1G)  Mid-diastolic 
murmurs result from obstruction and/or augmented flow at the level 
of the mitral or tricuspid valve. Rheumatic fever is the most common 
cause of MS (Fig. 42-6). In younger patients with pliable valves, S1 is 
loud and the murmur begins after an opening snap, which is a high-
pitched  sound  that  occurs  shortly  after  S2.  The  interval  between  the 
pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) and the opening 
snap is inversely related to the magnitude of the left atrial–left ventric-
ular pressure gradient. The murmur of MS is low-pitched and thus is 
best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. It is loudest at the left ven-
tricular apex and often is appreciated only when the patient is turned in 
the left lateral decubitus position. It is usually of grade 1 or 2 intensity

but may be absent when the cardiac output is severely reduced despite 
significant obstruction. The intensity of the murmur increases during 
maneuvers that increase cardiac output and mitral valve flow, such as 
exercise. The duration of the murmur reflects the length of time over 
which left atrial pressure exceeds left ventricular diastolic pressure. An 
increase in the intensity of the murmur just before S1, a phenomenon 
known  as  presystolic  accentuation  (Figs.  42-1A  and  42-6),  occurs  in 
patients  in  sinus  rhythm  and  is  due  to  a  late  increase  in  transmitral 
flow with atrial contraction. Presystolic accentuation does not occur in 
patients with atrial fibrillation.

The mid-diastolic murmur associated with tricuspid stenosis is best 
heard  at  the  lower  left  sternal  border  and  increases  in  intensity  with 
inspiration. A prolonged y descent may be visible in the jugular venous 
waveform.  This  murmur  is  very  difficult  to  hear  and  most  often  is 
obscured by left-sided acoustical events.

There  are  several  other  causes  of  mid-diastolic  murmurs.  Large 
left  atrial  myxomas  may  prolapse  across  the  mitral  valve  and  cause 
variable degrees of obstruction to left ventricular inflow (Chap. 271). 
The murmur associated with an atrial myxoma may change in duration 
and intensity with changes in body position. An opening snap is not 
present,  and  there  is  no  presystolic  accentuation.  Augmented  mitral 
diastolic flow can occur with isolated severe MR or with a large left-to-
right shunt at the ventricular or great vessel level and produce a soft, 
rapid filling sound (S3) followed by a short, low-pitched mid-diastolic 
apical  murmur  (Fig.  42-1G).  The  Austin  Flint  murmur  of  severe, 
chronic AR has already been described.

A short, mid-diastolic murmur is rarely heard during an episode of 
acute rheumatic fever (Carey-Coombs murmur) and probably is due 
to  flow  through  an  edematous  mitral  valve.  An  opening  snap  is  not 
present in the acute phase, and the murmur dissipates with resolution 
of the acute attack. Complete heart block with dyssynchronous atrial 
and ventricular activation may be associated with intermittent mid- to 
late  diastolic  murmurs  if  atrial  contraction  occurs  when  the  mitral 
valve is partially closed. Mid-diastolic murmurs indicative of increased 
tricuspid valve flow can occur with severe, isolated TR and with large 
ASDs and significant left-to-right shunting. Other signs of an ASD are 
present (Chap. 269), including fixed splitting of S2 and a midsystolic 
murmur at the mid- to upper left sternal border. TTE is indicated for 
evaluation of a patient with a mid- to late diastolic murmur. Findings 
specific to the diseases discussed above will help guide management.

 ■ CONTINUOUS MURMURS
(Figs.  42-1H  and  42-7)  Continuous  murmurs  begin  in  systole,  peak 
near the second heart sound, and continue into all or part of diastole. 
Their presence throughout the cardiac cycle implies a pressure gradient

FIGURE 42-7  Comparison of the continuous murmur and the to-fro murmur. During 
abnormal  communication  between  high-pressure  and  low-pressure  systems,  a 
large pressure gradient exists throughout the cardiac cycle, producing a continuous 
murmur. A classic example is patent ductus arteriosus. At times, this type of murmur 
can be confused with a to-fro murmur, which is a combination of systolic ejection 
murmur and a murmur of semilunar valve incompetence. A classic example of a to-fro 
murmur  is  aortic  stenosis  and  regurgitation.  A  continuous  murmur  crescendos  to 
near the second heart sound (S2), whereas a to-fro murmur has two components. The 
midsystolic ejection component decrescendos and disappears as it approaches S2.

Heart ©American Heart Association, Inc.)

between two chambers or vessels during both systole and diastole. The 
continuous murmur associated with a patent ductus arteriosus is best 
heard lateral to the upper left sternal border. Large, uncorrected shunts 
may lead to pulmonary hypertension, attenuation or obliteration of the 
diastolic component of the murmur, reversal of shunt flow, and differ-
ential cyanosis of the lower extremities. A ruptured sinus of Valsalva 
aneurysm creates a continuous murmur of abrupt onset at the upper 
right sternal border. Rupture typically occurs into a right heart cham-
ber, and the murmur is indicative of a continuous pressure difference 
between the aorta and either the right atrium or the right ventricle. A 
continuous murmur also may be audible along the left sternal border 
with a coronary arteriovenous fistula and at the site of an arteriovenous 
fistula used for hemodialysis access. Enhanced flow through enlarged 
intercostal  collateral  arteries  in  patients  with  aortic  coarctation  may 
produce a continuous murmur along the course of one or more ribs. 
A  cervical  bruit  with  both  systolic  and  diastolic  components  (a  to-
fro  murmur,  Fig.  42-7)  usually  indicates  a  high-grade  carotid  artery 
stenosis.

Not all continuous murmurs are pathologic. A continuous venous 
hum  can  be  heard  in  healthy  children  and  young  adults,  especially 
during  pregnancy;  it  is  best  appreciated  in  the  right  supraclavicular 
fossa and can be obliterated by pressure over the right internal jugular 
vein or by having the patient turn his or her head toward the examiner. 
The continuous mammary souffle of pregnancy is created by enhanced 
arterial  flow  through  engorged  breasts  and  usually  appears  during 
the  late  third  trimester  or  early  puerperium.  The  murmur  is  louder 
in  systole.  Firm  pressure  with  the  diaphragm  of  the  stethoscope  can 
eliminate the diastolic portion of the murmur.
 ■ DYNAMIC AUSCULTATION
(Table 42-2; see Table 239-1) Careful attention to the behavior of heart 
murmurs  during  simple  maneuvers  that  alter  cardiac  hemodynamics 
can provide important clues to their cause and significance.

Respiration  Auscultation should be performed during quiet respi-
ration or with a modest increase in inspiratory effort, as more forceful 
movement of the chest tends to obscure the heart sounds. Left-sided 
murmurs may be best heard at end expiration, when lung volumes are 
minimized,  and  the  heart  and  great  vessels  are  brought  closer  to  the 
chest wall. This phenomenon is characteristic of the murmur of AR. 
Murmurs of right-sided origin, such as tricuspid or pulmonic regur-
gitation, increase in intensity during inspiration. The intensity of left-
sided murmurs either remains constant or decreases with inspiration.
Bedside  assessment  also  should  evaluate  the  behavior  of  S2  with 
respiration and the dynamic relationship between the aortic and pul-
monic components (Fig. 42-8). Reversed splitting can be a feature of 
severe AS, HOCM, left bundle branch block, right ventricular pacing, 
or acute myocardial ischemia. Fixed splitting of S2 in the presence of 
a  grade  2  or  3  midsystolic  murmur  at  the  mid-  or  upper  left  sternal 
border  indicates  an  ASD.  Physiologic  but  wide  splitting  during  the 
respiratory cycle implies either premature aortic valve closure, as can 
occur with severe MR, or delayed pulmonic valve closure due to PS or 
right bundle branch block.

Alterations  of  Systemic  Vascular  Resistance  Murmurs  can 
change  characteristics  after  maneuvers  that  alter  systemic  vascular

FIGURE 42-8  Top. Normal physiologic splitting of the second heart sound. During 
expiration, the aortic (A2) and pulmonic (P2) components of the second heart sound 
are separated by <30 ms and are appreciated as a single sound. During inspiration, 
the splitting interval widens, and A2 and P2 are clearly separated into two distinct 
sounds. Bottom. Audible expiratory splitting. Wide physiologic splitting is caused by 
a delay in P2 (as, for example, with right bundle branch block) or by early closure of the 
aortic valve (A2, as for example with severe mitral regurgitation). Reversed splitting 
is caused by a delay in A2, resulting in paradoxical movement; i.e., with inspiration 
P2 moves toward A2, and the splitting interval narrows. Narrow physiologic splitting 
occurs in pulmonary hypertension, and both A2 and P2 are heard during expiration 
at a narrow splitting interval because of the increased intensity and high-frequency 
composition  of  P2.  (Reprinted  with  permission  Examination  of  the  Heart,  Part  IV:

resistance and left ventricular afterload. The systolic murmurs of MR 
and  VSD  become  louder  during  sustained  handgrip,  simultaneous 
inflation  of  blood  pressure  cuffs  on  both  upper  extremities  to  pres-
sures  20–40  mmHg  above  systolic  pressure  for  20  s,  or  infusion  of  a 
vasopressor  agent.  The  murmurs  associated  with  AS  or  HOCM  will 
become  softer  or  remain  unchanged  with  these  maneuvers.  The  dia-
stolic murmur of AR becomes louder in response to interventions that 
raise systemic vascular resistance.

Opposite changes in systolic and diastolic murmurs may occur with 
the  use  of  pharmacologic  agents  that  lower  systemic  vascular  resis-
tance. Inhaled amyl nitrite is now rarely used for this purpose but can 
help distinguish the murmur of AS or HOCM from that of either MR 
or  VSD,  if  necessary.  The  former  two  murmurs  increase  in  intensity, 
whereas  the  latter  two  become  softer  after  exposure  to  amyl  nitrite. 
As noted previously, the Austin Flint murmur of severe AR becomes 
softer, but the mid-diastolic rumble of MS becomes louder, in response 
to the abrupt lowering of systemic vascular resistance with amyl nitrite 
and enhanced transmitral valve flow.

Changes in Venous Return  The Valsalva maneuver results in an 
increase  in  intrathoracic  pressure,  followed  by  a  decrease  in  venous 
return,  ventricular  filling,  and  cardiac  output.  The  majority  of  mur-
murs  decrease  in  intensity  during  the  strain  phase  of  the  maneuver. 
Two  notable  exceptions  are  the  murmurs  associated  with  MVP  and 
HOCM, both of which become louder during the Valsalva maneuver. 
The  murmur  of  MVP  may  also  become  longer  as  leaflet  prolapse 
occurs  earlier  in  systole  at  smaller  ventricular  volumes.  These  mur-
murs behave in a similar and parallel fashion with standing. Both the 
click  and  the  murmur  of  MVP  move  closer  in  timing  to  S1  on  rapid 
standing  from  a  squatting  position  (Fig.  42-3).  The  increase  in  the

intensity  of  the  murmur  of  HOCM  is  predicated  on  the  augmenta-
tion of the dynamic left ventricular outflow tract gradient that occurs 
with reduced ventricular filling. Squatting results in abrupt increases 
in  both  venous  return  (preload)  and  left  ventricular  afterload  that 
increase ventricular volume, changes that predictably cause a decrease 
in  the  intensity  and  duration  of  the  murmurs  associated  with  MVP 
and HOCM; the click and murmur of MVP move away from S1 with 
squatting. Passive leg raising can be used to increase venous return in 
patients who are unable to squat and stand. This maneuver may lead to 
a decrease in the intensity of the murmur associated with HOCM but 
has less effect in patients with MVP.

Post-Premature  Ventricular  Contraction  A  change  in  the 
intensity of a systolic murmur in the first beat after a premature beat, 
or in the beat after a long cycle length in patients with atrial fibrillation, 
can help distinguish AS from MR, particularly in an older patient in 
whom the murmur of AS is well transmitted to the apex. Systolic mur-
murs  due  to  left  ventricular  outflow  obstruction,  including  that  due 
to AS, increase in intensity in the beat after a premature beat because 
of the combined effects of enhanced left ventricular filling and post- 
extrasystolic potentiation of contractile function. Forward flow accel-
erates, causing an increase in the gradient and a louder murmur. The 
intensity of the murmur of MR does not change in the post-premature 
beat as there is relatively little further increase in mitral valve flow or 
change in the left ventricular–left atrial gradient.

 ■ THE CLINICAL CONTEXT
Additional clues to the etiology and importance of a heart murmur can 
be gleaned from the history and other physical examination findings. 
Symptoms  suggestive  of  cardiovascular,  neurologic,  or  pulmonary 
disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to 
the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other 
heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In 
many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may 
have  been  obtained  earlier  and  may  contain  valuable  information.  A 
patient  with  suspected  infective  endocarditis,  for  example,  may  have 
a  murmur  in  the  setting  of  fever,  chills,  anorexia,  fatigue,  dyspnea, 
splenomegaly,  petechiae,  and  positive  blood  cultures.  A  new  systolic 
murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent 
MI suggests myocardial rupture. By contrast, an isolated grade 1 or 2 
midsystolic murmur at the left sternal border in a healthy, active, and 
asymptomatic  young  adult  is  most  likely  a  benign  finding  for  which 
no further evaluation is indicated. The context in which the murmur 
is appreciated often dictates the need for further testing and the pace 
of the evaluation.

 ■ ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
(Fig. 42-9; Chaps. 239 and 241) Echocardiography with color flow and 
spectral Doppler is a valuable tool for the assessment of cardiac mur-
murs.  Information  regarding  valve  structure  and  function,  chamber 
size, wall thickness, ventricular function, estimated pulmonary artery 
pressures,  intracardiac  shunt  flow,  pulmonary  and  hepatic  vein  flow, 
and aortic flow can be ascertained readily. It is important to note that 
Doppler  signals  of  trace  or  mild  valvular  regurgitation  of  no  clinical 
consequence can be detected with structurally normal tricuspid, pul-
monic, and mitral valves. Such signals are not likely to generate enough 
turbulence to create an audible murmur.

FIGURE 42-9  Strategy for evaluating heart murmurs. *If an electrocardiogram or chest x-ray has been 
obtained and is abnormal, echocardiography is indicated. MR, magnetic resonance; TEE, transesophageal 
echocardiography; TTE, transthoracic echocardiography. (Adapted from RO Bonow et al: 1998 ACC/AHA 
Guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease. J Am Coll Cardiol 32:1486, 1998.)

echocardiography  to  follow  the  course  of  asymptomatic  individuals 
with  valvular  heart  disease  is  a  central  feature  of  their  longitudinal 
assessment,  and  it  provides  valuable  information  that  may  have  an 
impact on decisions regarding the timing of surgery. Routine echocar-
diography is not recommended for asymptomatic patients with a grade 
1  or  2  midsystolic  murmur  without  other  signs  of  heart  disease.  For 
this category of patients, referral to a cardiovascular specialist could be 
considered if there is doubt about the significance of the murmur after 
the initial examination.

The  selective  use  of  echocardiography  outlined  above  has  not 
been  subjected  to  rigorous  analysis  of  its  cost-effectiveness.  For 
some clinicians, handheld or miniaturized cardiac ultrasound devices 
have  replaced  the  stethoscope.  Although  several  reports  attest  to  the 
improved sensitivity of such devices for the detection of valvular heart 
disease (e.g., rheumatic heart disease in susceptible populations), accu-
racy is highly operator-dependent, and incremental cost considerations 
and  outcomes  have  not  been  addressed  adequately  for  most  patient 
scenarios.  The  use  of  electronic  or  digital  stethoscopes  with  spectral 
display  capabilities  has  also  been  proposed  as  a  method  to  improve 
the characterization of heart murmurs and the mentored teaching of 
cardiac auscultation.

 ■ OTHER CARDIAC TESTING
(Chap.  241,  Fig.  42-9)  In  relatively  few  patients,  clinical  assessment 
and  TTE  do  not  adequately  characterize  the  origin  and  significance 
of a heart murmur. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be 
considered for further evaluation, especially when the TTE windows 
are limited by body size, chest configuration, or intrathoracic pathol-
ogy. TEE offers enhanced sensitivity for the detection of a wide range 
of structural cardiac disorders. Electrocardiographically gated cardiac 
magnetic  resonance  (CMR)  imaging  can  provide  quantitative  infor-
mation  regarding  valvular  function,  regurgitant  fraction,  regurgitant 
volume, shunt flow, chamber and great vessel size, ventricular function, 
and  myocardial  perfusion.  CMR  imaging  has  largely  supplanted  the 
need for cardiac catheterization and invasive hemodynamic assessment 
when  there  is  a  discrepancy  between  the  clinical  and  echocardio-
graphic findings in patients with regurgitant heart valve disease, such 
as MR or AR. Both CMR and cardiac CT can provide assessment of 
aortic valve leaflet number when there is uncertainty by TTE regarding 
whether  the  valve  is  bi-  or  tricuspid,  as  well  as  provide  information 
on aortic root and ascending aortic anatomy. The use of coronary CT 
angiography  to  exclude  coronary  artery  disease  in  selected  patients 
with a low pretest probability of disease before valve surgery has gained 

wider acceptance. Invasive angiography and hemo-
dynamic  assessment  may  be  required  for  a  more 
complete preoperative evaluation.
 ■ INTEGRATED APPROACH
The  accurate  identification  of  a  heart  murmur 
begins  with  a  systematic  approach  to  cardiac  aus-
cultation.  Characterization  of  its  major  attributes, 
as  reviewed  above,  allows  the  examiner  to  con-
struct a preliminary differential diagnosis, which is 
then refined by integration of information available 
from  the  history,  associated  cardiac  findings,  the 
general physical examination, and the clinical con-
text.  The  need  for  and  urgency  of  further  testing 
follow  sequentially.  Correlation  of  the  findings  on 
auscultation  with  the  noninvasive  data  provides 
an  educational  feedback  loop  and  an  opportunity 
for  improving  physical  examination  skills.  Cost 
considerations  mandate  that  noninvasive  imaging 
be  justified  on  the  basis  of  its  incremental  con-
tribution  to  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  outcome. 
Cardiac auscultation using a stethoscope remains a 
time-honored tradition in medicine, the benefits of 
which extend beyond accurate recognition of heart 
sounds.  Selective  augmentation  with,  rather  than 
wholesale replacement by, handheld ultrasound and 
newer technologies may improve diagnostic accuracy and better guide 
therapeutic decisions.

43 Palpitations

Joseph Loscalzo

Palpitations  are  extremely  common  among  patients  who  present  to 
their internists and can best be defined as a “thumping,” “pounding,” 
or “fluttering” sensation in the chest. This sensation can be either inter-
mittent or sustained and either regular or irregular. Most patients inter-
pret palpitations as an unusual awareness of the heartbeat and become 
especially concerned when they sense that they have had “skipped” or 
“missing” heartbeats. Palpitations are often noted when the patient is 
quietly resting, during which time other stimuli are minimal. Palpita-
tions  that  are  positional  generally  reflect  a  structural  process  within 
(e.g., atrial myxoma) or adjacent to (e.g., mediastinal mass) the heart.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesPalpitations are brought about by cardiac (43%), psychiatric (31%), 
miscellaneous  (10%),  and  unknown  (16%)  causes,  according  to  one 
large series. Among the cardiovascular causes are premature atrial and 
ventricular contractions, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, 
mitral valve prolapse (with or without associated arrhythmias), aortic 
insufficiency, atrial myxoma, myocarditis, and pulmonary embolism. 
Intermittent palpitations are commonly caused by premature atrial or 
ventricular  contractions:  the  post-extrasystolic  beat  is  sensed  by  the 
patient  owing  to  the  increase  in  ventricular  end-diastolic  dimension 
following  the  pause  in  the  cardiac  cycle  and  the  increased  strength 
of  contraction  (post-extrasystolic  potentiation)  of  that  beat.  Regular, 
sustained  palpitations  can  be  caused  by  regular  supraventricular  and 
ventricular tachycardias. Irregular, sustained palpitations can be caused 
by atrial fibrillation. It is important to note that most arrhythmias are 
not  associated  with  palpitations.  In  those  that  are,  it  is  often  useful 
either to ask the patient to “tap out” the rhythm of the palpitations or 
to take his or her pulse during palpitations. In general, hyperdynamic 
cardiovascular  states  caused  by  catecholaminergic  stimulation  from 
exercise, stress, or pheochromocytoma can lead to palpitations. Palpita-
tions are common among athletes, especially older endurance athletes. 
In addition, the enlarged ventricle of aortic regurgitation and accom-
panying  hyperdynamic  precordium  frequently  lead  to  the  sensation 
of palpitations. Other factors that enhance the strength of myocardial 
contraction, including tobacco, caffeine, aminophylline, atropine, thy-
roxine, cocaine, and amphetamines, can cause palpitations.

Psychiatric causes of palpitations include panic attacks or disorders, 
anxiety states, and somatization, alone or in combination. Patients with 
psychiatric  causes  for  palpitations  more  commonly  report  a  longer 
duration  of  the  sensation  (>15  min)  and  other  accompanying  symp-
toms  than  do  patients  with  other  causes.  Among  the  miscellaneous 
causes of palpitations are thyrotoxicosis, drugs (see above) and ethanol, 
spontaneous skeletal muscle contractions of the chest wall, pheochro-
mocytoma, and systemic mastocytosis.

possibly  more  cost-effective  in  the  assessment  of  patients  with 
(infrequent) recurrent, unexplained palpitations. The use of a diary 
or an electronic marker to indicate the timing of palpitations sensed 
by  the  patient  is  essential  for  appropriate  interpretation  of  these 
studies.

Most patients with palpitations do not have serious arrhythmias 
or  underlying  structural  heart  disease.  If  sufficiently  troubling 
to  the  patient,  occasional  benign  atrial  or  ventricular  premature 
contractions  can  often  be  managed  with  beta-blocker  therapy. 
Palpitations  incited  by  alcohol,  tobacco,  or  illicit  drugs  need  to 
be  managed  by  abstention,  while  those  caused  by  pharmacologic 
agents  should  be  addressed  by  considering  alternative  therapies 
when appropriate or possible. Psychiatric causes of palpitations may 
benefit from cognitive therapy or pharmacotherapy. The physician 
should note that palpitations are at the very least bothersome and, 
on occasion, frightening to the patient. Once serious causes for the 
symptom have been excluded, the patient should be reassured that 
the palpitations will not adversely affect prognosis.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Palpitations

The principal goal in assessing patients with palpitations is to deter-
mine whether the symptom is caused by a life-threatening arrhyth-
mia.  Patients  with  preexisting  coronary  artery  disease  (CAD)  or 
risk factors for CAD are at greatest risk for ventricular arrhythmias 
(Chap. 246) as a cause for palpitations. In addition, the association 
of  palpitations  with  other  symptoms  suggesting  hemodynamic 
compromise,  including  syncope  or  lightheadedness,  supports  this 
diagnosis.  Palpitations  caused  by  sustained  tachyarrhythmias  in 
patients  with  CAD  can  be  accompanied  by  angina  pectoris  or 
dyspnea, and, in patients with ventricular dysfunction (systolic or 
diastolic),  aortic  stenosis,  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  or  mitral 
stenosis (with or without CAD), can be accompanied by dyspnea 
from increased left atrial and pulmonary venous pressure.

Key features of the physical examination that will help confirm or 
refute the presence of an arrhythmia as a cause for palpitations (as 
well  as  its  adverse  hemodynamic  consequences)  include  measure-
ment  of  the  vital  signs,  assessment  of  the  jugular  venous  pressure 
and pulse, and auscultation of the chest and precordium. A resting 
electrocardiogram  can  be  used  to  document  the  arrhythmia.  If 
exertion  is  known  to  induce  the  arrhythmia  and  accompanying 
palpitations, exercise electrocardiography can be used to make the 
diagnosis. If the arrhythmia is sufficiently infrequent, other methods 
must  be  used,  including  continuous  electrocardiographic  (Holter) 
monitoring;  telephonic  monitoring,  through  which  the  patient 
can transmit an electrocardiographic tracing during a sensed epi-
sode; loop recordings (external or implantable), which can capture 
the  electrocardiographic  event  for  later  review;  and  mobile  (self- 
monitoring) cardiac outpatient telemetry. Data suggest that Holter 
monitoring is of limited clinical utility, while the implantable loop 
recorder  and  mobile  cardiac  outpatient  telemetry  are  safe  and

44 Dysphagia

Ikuo Hirano, Peter J. Kahrilas

Dysphagia—difficulty  with  swallowing—refers  to  problems  with  the 
transit  of  food  or  liquid  from  the  mouth  to  the  hypopharynx  or 
through  the  esophagus.  Severe  dysphagia  can  compromise  nutrition, 
cause  aspiration,  and  reduce  quality  of  life.  Additional  terminology 
pertaining to swallowing dysfunction is as follows. Aphagia (inability 
to  swallow)  typically  denotes  complete  esophageal  obstruction,  most 
commonly encountered in the acute setting of a food bolus or foreign 
body  impaction.  Odynophagia  refers  to  painful  swallowing,  typically 
resulting  from  mucosal  ulceration  within  the  oropharynx  or  esoph-
agus. It commonly is accompanied by dysphagia, but the converse is 
not true. Globus pharyngeus is a foreign body sensation localized in the 
neck that does not interfere with swallowing and sometimes is relieved 
by swallowing. Transfer dysphagia frequently results in nasal regurgita-
tion or pulmonary aspiration during swallowing and is characteristic of 
oropharyngeal dysphagia. Phagophobia (fear of swallowing) and refusal 
to swallow may be psychogenic or related to anticipatory anxiety about 
food bolus obstruction, odynophagia, or aspiration.
 ■ PHYSIOLOGY OF SWALLOWING
Swallowing begins with a voluntary (oral) phase that includes prepa-
ration during which food is masticated and mixed with saliva. This is 
followed by a transfer phase during which the bolus is pushed into the 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   287

pharynx by the tongue. Bolus entry into the hypopharynx initiates the 
pharyngeal swallow response, which is centrally mediated and involves 
a complex series of actions, the net result of which is to propel food 
through  the  pharynx  into  the  esophagus  while  preventing  its  entry 
into the airway. To accomplish this, the larynx is elevated and pulled 
forward, actions that also facilitate upper esophageal sphincter (UES) 
opening. Tongue pulsion then propels the bolus through the UES, fol-
lowed by a peristaltic contraction that clears residue from the pharynx 
and  through  the  esophagus.  The  lower  esophageal  sphincter  (LES) 
relaxes  as  the  food  enters  the  esophagus  and  remains  relaxed  until 
the  peristaltic  contraction  has  delivered  the  bolus  into  the  stomach. 
Peristaltic  contractions  elicited  in  response  to  a  swallow  are  called 
primary peristalsis and involve sequenced inhibition followed by con-
traction of the musculature along the entire length of the esophagus. 
The inhibition that precedes the peristaltic contraction is called deglu-
titive inhibition. Local distention of the esophagus anywhere along its 
length, as may occur with gastroesophageal reflux, activates secondary 
peristalsis that begins at the point of distention and proceeds distally. 
Tertiary esophageal contractions are nonperistaltic, disordered esoph-
ageal contractions that may be observed to occur spontaneously during 
fluoroscopic observation.

The  musculature  of  the  oral  cavity,  pharynx,  UES,  and  cervical 
esophagus is striated and directly innervated by lower motor neurons 
carried in cranial nerves (Fig. 44-1). Oral cavity muscles are innervated 
by the fifth (trigeminal) and seventh (facial) cranial nerves; the tongue, 
by  the  twelfth  (hypoglossal)  cranial  nerve.  Pharyngeal  muscles  are 
innervated by the ninth (glossopharyngeal) and tenth (vagus) cranial 
nerves.

Physiologically,  the  UES  consists  of  the  cricopharyngeus  muscle, 
the  adjacent  inferior  pharyngeal  constrictor,  and  the  proximal  por-
tion  of  the  cervical  esophagus.  UES  innervation  is  derived  from  the 
vagus  nerve,  whereas  the  innervation  to  the  musculature  acting  on 
the  UES  to  facilitate  its  opening  during  swallowing  comes  from  the 
fifth, seventh, and twelfth cranial nerves. The UES remains closed at 
rest  owing  to  both  its  inherent  elastic  properties  and  neurogenically 
mediated  contraction  of  the  cricopharyngeus  muscle.  UES  opening 
during  swallowing  involves  both  cessation  of  vagal  excitation  to  the 

cricopharyngeus and simultaneous contraction of the suprahyoid and 
geniohyoid  muscles  that  pull  open  the  UES  in  conjunction  with  the 
upward and forward displacement of the larynx.

The neuromuscular apparatus for peristalsis is distinct in proximal 
and  distal  parts  of  the  esophagus.  The  cervical  esophagus,  like  the 
pharyngeal  musculature,  consists  of  striated  muscle  and  is  directly 
innervated by lower motor neurons of the vagus nerve. Peristalsis in 
the  proximal  esophagus  is  governed  by  the  sequential  activation  of 
the  vagal  motor  neurons  in  the  nucleus  ambiguus.  In  contrast,  the 
distal  esophagus  and  LES  are  composed  of  smooth  muscle  and  are 
controlled by excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the esophageal 
myenteric  plexus.  Medullary  preganglionic  neurons  from  the  dorsal 
motor nucleus of the vagus trigger peristalsis via these ganglionic neu-
rons  during  primary  peristalsis.  Neurotransmitters  of  the  excitatory 
ganglionic  neurons  are  acetylcholine  and  substance  P;  those  of  the 
inhibitory  neurons  are  vasoactive  intestinal  peptide  and  nitric  oxide. 
Peristalsis results from the patterned activation of inhibitory followed 
by  excitatory  ganglionic  neurons,  with  progressive  dominance  of  the 
inhibitory  neurons  distally.  Similarly,  LES  relaxation  occurs  with  the 
onset of deglutitive inhibition and persists until the peristaltic sequence 
is complete. At rest, the LES is contracted because of excitatory gan-
glionic  stimulation  and  its  intrinsic  myogenic  tone,  a  property  that 
distinguishes it from the adjacent esophagus. The function of the LES 
is supplemented by the surrounding muscle of the right diaphragmatic 
crus, which acts as an external sphincter during inspiration, cough, or 
abdominal straining.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DYSPHAGIA
Dysphagia  can  be  subclassified  both  by  location  and  by  the  circum-
stances  in  which  it  occurs.  With  respect  to  location,  distinct  consid-
erations  apply  to  oral,  pharyngeal,  or  esophageal  dysphagia.  Normal 
transport of an ingested bolus depends on the consistency and size of 
the bolus, the caliber of the lumen, the integrity of peristaltic contrac-
tion, and deglutitive inhibition of both the UES and the LES. Dyspha-
gia caused by an oversized bolus or a narrow lumen is called structural 
dysphagia,  whereas  dysphagia  due  to  abnormalities  of  peristalsis  or 
impaired  sphincter  relaxation  after  swallowing  is  called propulsive  or

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesmotor  dysphagia.  More  than  one  mechanism  may  be  operative  in  a 
patient with dysphagia. Scleroderma commonly presents with absent 
peristalsis as well as a weakened LES that predisposes patients to peptic 
stricture formation. Likewise, radiation therapy for head and neck can-
cer may compound the functional deficits in the oropharyngeal swal-
low attributable to the tumor and cause cervical esophageal stenosis. It 
is worth noting that in addition to bolus transit, symptom reporting of 
dysphagia  is  dependent  upon  intact  sensory  innervation  and  central 
nervous system perception.

Oral  and  Pharyngeal  (Oropharyngeal)  Dysphagia  Oral-
phase dysphagia is associated with poor bolus formation and control 
so that food has prolonged retention within the oral cavity and may 
seep out of the mouth. Drooling and difficulty in initiating swallow-
ing  are  other  characteristic  signs.  Poor  bolus  control  also  may  lead 
to  premature  spillage  of  food  into  the  hypopharynx  with  resultant 
aspiration  into  the  trachea  or  regurgitation  into  the  nasal  cavity.  
Pharyngeal-phase  dysphagia  is  associated  with  retention  of  food  in 
the pharynx due to poor tongue or pharyngeal propulsion or obstruc-
tion at the UES. Signs and symptoms of concomitant hoarseness or 
cranial  nerve  dysfunction  may  be  associated  with  oropharyngeal 
dysphagia.

Oropharyngeal  dysphagia  may  be  due  to  neurologic,  muscular, 
structural,  iatrogenic,  infectious,  and  metabolic  causes.  Iatrogenic, 
neurologic,  and  structural  pathologies  are  most  common.  Iatrogenic 
causes include surgery and radiation, often in the setting of head and 
neck  cancer.  Neurogenic  dysphagia  resulting  from  cerebrovascular 
accidents,  Parkinson’s  disease,  and  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis  is 
a  major  source  of  morbidity  related  to  aspiration  and  malnutrition. 
Medullary nuclei directly innervate the oropharynx. Lateralization of 
pharyngeal dysphagia implies either a structural pharyngeal lesion or 
a neurologic process that selectively targeted the ipsilateral brainstem 
nuclei  or  cranial  nerve.  Advances  in  functional  brain  imaging  have 
elucidated  an  important  role  of  the  cerebral  cortex  in  swallow  func-
tion  and  dysphagia.  Asymmetry  in  the  cortical  representation  of  the 
pharynx  provides  an  explanation  for  the  dysphagia  that  occurs  as  a 
consequence of unilateral cortical cerebrovascular accidents.

Oropharyngeal  structural 

lesions  causing  dysphagia  include 
Zenker’s  diverticulum,  cricopharyngeal  bar,  and  neoplasia.  Zenker’s 
diverticulum  typically  is  encountered  in  elderly  patients.  In  addition 
to  dysphagia,  patients  may  present  with  regurgitation  of  particulate 
food  debris,  aspiration,  and  halitosis.  The  pathogenesis  is  related  to 
stenosis  of  the  cricopharyngeus  that  causes  diminished  opening  of 
the  UES  and  results  in  increased  hypopharyngeal  pressure  during 
swallowing with development of a pulsion diverticulum immediately 
above the cricopharyngeus in a region of potential weakness known as 
Killian’s dehiscence. A cricopharyngeal bar, appearing as a prominent 
indentation  behind  the  lower  third  of  the  cricoid  cartilage,  is  related 
to Zenker’s diverticulum in that it involves limited distensibility of the 
cricopharyngeus  and  can  lead  to  the  formation  of  a  Zenker’s  diver-
ticulum.  However,  a  cricopharyngeal  bar  is  a  common  radiographic 
finding,  and  most  patients  with  transient  cricopharyngeal  bars  are 
asymptomatic, making it important to rule out alternative etiologies of 
dysphagia  before  treatment.  Furthermore,  cricopharyngeal  bars  may 
be  secondary  to  other  neuromuscular  disorders  that  impair  opening 
of the UES.

Since the pharyngeal phase of swallowing occurs in less than a sec-
ond, rapid-sequence fluoroscopy is necessary to evaluate for functional 
abnormalities.  Adequate  fluoroscopic  examination  requires  that  the 
patient be conscious and cooperative. The study incorporates record-
ings of swallow sequences during ingestion of food and liquids of vary-
ing consistencies. The pharynx is examined to detect bolus retention, 
regurgitation into the nose, or aspiration into the trachea. Timing and 
integrity  of  pharyngeal  contraction  and  opening  of  the  UES  with  a 
swallow  are  analyzed  to  assess  both  aspiration  risk  and  the  potential 
for swallow therapy. Structural abnormalities of the oropharynx, espe-
cially those that may require biopsies, also should be assessed by direct 
laryngoscopic examination.

Esophageal Dysphagia  The adult esophagus measures 18–26 cm  
in  length  and  is  anatomically  divided  into  the  cervical  esophagus, 
extending  from  the  pharyngoesophageal  junction  to  the  suprasternal 
notch, and the thoracic esophagus, which continues to the diaphrag-
matic  hiatus.  When  distended,  the  esophageal  lumen  has  internal 
dimensions of about 2 cm in the anteroposterior plane and 3 cm in the 
lateral plane. Solid food dysphagia becomes common when the lumen 
is  narrowed  to  <13  mm,  but  also  can  occur  with  larger  diameters  in 
the setting of poorly masticated food or motor dysfunction. Circum-
ferential lesions are more likely to cause dysphagia than are lesions that 
involve only a partial circumference of the esophageal wall. The most 
common  structural  causes  of  dysphagia  are  Schatzki’s  rings,  eosino-
philic esophagitis, and peptic strictures. Dysphagia also occurs in the 
setting of gastroesophageal reflux disease without a stricture, perhaps 
on the basis of altered esophageal sensation, reduced esophageal mural 
distensibility, or motor dysfunction.

Propulsive  disorders  leading  to  esophageal  dysphagia  result  from 
abnormalities  of  peristalsis  and/or  deglutitive  inhibition,  potentially 
affecting  the  cervical  or  thoracic  esophagus.  Since  striated  muscle 
pathology usually involves both the oropharynx and the cervical esoph-
agus, the clinical manifestations usually are dominated by oropharyngeal 
dysphagia. Diseases affecting smooth muscle involve both the thoracic 
esophagus  and  the  LES.  A  dominant  manifestation  of  this,  absent 
peristalsis,  refers  to  either  the  complete  absence  of  swallow-induced 
contraction (absent contractility) or the presence of nonperistaltic, dis-
ordered contractions. Absent peristalsis and failure of deglutitive LES 
relaxation are the defining features of achalasia. In diffuse esophageal 
spasm  (DES),  LES  function  is  normal,  with  the  disordered  motility 
restricted to the esophageal body. Absent contractility combined with 
severe weakness of the LES is a pattern commonly found in patients 
with scleroderma.

Figure 44-2 shows an algorithm for the approach to a patient with 
dysphagia. 
HISTORY
The patient history is extremely valuable in making a presumptive 
diagnosis or at least substantially limiting the differential diagnoses 
in most patients. Key elements of the history are the localization of 
dysphagia,  the  circumstances  in  which  dysphagia  is  experienced, 
other symptoms associated with dysphagia, and progression. Dys-
phagia that localizes to the suprasternal notch may indicate either 
an oropharyngeal or an esophageal etiology as distal dysphagia is 
referred  proximally  about  30%  of  the  time.  Dysphagia  that  local-
izes  to  the  chest  is  esophageal  in  origin.  Nasal  regurgitation  and 
tracheobronchial  aspiration  manifest  by  coughing  with  swallow-
ing are hallmarks of oropharyngeal dysphagia. Severe cough with 
swallowing may also be a sign of a tracheoesophageal fistula. The 
presence of hoarseness may be another important diagnostic clue. 
When hoarseness precedes dysphagia, the primary lesion is usually 
laryngeal; hoarseness that occurs after the development of dyspha-
gia may result from compromise of the recurrent laryngeal nerve by 
a malignancy. The type of food causing dysphagia is an important 
consideration.  Intermittent  dysphagia  that  occurs  only  with  solid 
food  implies  structural  dysphagia,  whereas  constant  dysphagia 
with both liquids and solids strongly suggests an esophageal motor 
abnormality. Two caveats to this pattern are that despite having a 
motor  abnormality,  patients  with  scleroderma  generally  develop 
mild  dysphagia  for  solids  only  and  that  patients  with  oropharyn-
geal dysphagia often have greater difficulty managing liquids than 
solids.  Dysphagia  that  is  progressive  over  the  course  of  weeks  to 
months  raises  concern  for  neoplasia.  Episodic  dysphagia  to  sol-
ids  that  is  unchanged  or  slowly  progressive  over  years  indicates 
a  benign  disease  process  such  as  a  Schatzki  ring  or  eosinophilic

esophagitis. Food impaction with a prolonged inability to pass an 
ingested bolus even with ingestion of liquid is typical of a structural 
dysphagia.  Chest  pain  may  accompany  dysphagia  whether  it  is 
related to motor disorders, structural disorders, or reflux disease. A 
prolonged history of heartburn preceding the onset of dysphagia is 
suggestive of peptic stricture and, infrequently, esophageal adeno-
carcinoma. A history of prolonged nasogastric intubation, esopha-
geal or head and neck surgery, ingestion of caustic agents or pills, 
previous radiation or chemotherapy, or associated mucocutaneous 
diseases may help isolate the cause of dysphagia. With accompany-
ing  odynophagia,  which  usually  is  indicative  of  ulceration,  infec-
tious  or  pill-induced  esophagitis  should  be  suspected.  In  patients 
with AIDS or other immunocompromised states, esophagitis due to 
opportunistic infections such as Candida, herpes simplex virus, or 
cytomegalovirus and to tumors such as Kaposi’s sarcoma and lym-
phoma should be considered. A history of atopy increases concerns 
for eosinophilic esophagitis, which is most prevalent in Caucasian 
male patients between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Medication use 
should identify agents associated with pill esophagitis and narcotics 
that are associated with opioid-induced esophageal dysmotility. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Physical  examination  is  important  in  the  evaluation  of  oral  and 
pharyngeal  dysphagia  because  dysphagia  is  usually  only  one  of 
many manifestations of a more global disease process. Signs of bul-
bar or pseudobulbar palsy, including dysarthria, dysphonia, ptosis, 
and tongue atrophy, in addition to evidence of generalized neuro-
muscular disease, should be elicited. The neck should be examined 
for  thyromegaly  or  lymphadenopathy.  A  careful  inspection  of  the 
mouth  and  pharynx  should  disclose  inflammatory  or  infectious 
lesions. Missing dentition can interfere with mastication and exac-
erbate an existing cause of dysphagia. Physical examination is less 
helpful in the evaluation of esophageal dysphagia as most relevant 

pathology is restricted to the esophagus. The notable exception is 
skin disease. Changes in the skin and oral mucosa may suggest a 
diagnosis of scleroderma or mucocutaneous diseases such as pem-
phigoid, lichen planus, and epidermolysis bullosa, all of which can 
involve the esophagus. 

DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
Although  most  instances  of  dysphagia  are  attributable  to  benign 
disease processes, dysphagia is also a cardinal symptom of several 
malignancies, making it an important symptom to evaluate. Cancer 
may result in dysphagia most commonly as the result of intralumi-
nal obstruction (esophageal or proximal gastric cancer, metastatic 
deposits)  and  less  commonly  due  to  extrinsic  compression  (lym-
phoma, lung cancer) or paraneoplastic syndromes. Even when not 
attributable to malignancy, dysphagia is usually a manifestation of 
an  identifiable  and  treatable  disease  entity,  making  its  evaluation 
beneficial  to  the  patient  and  gratifying  to  the  practitioner.  The 
specific diagnostic algorithm to pursue is guided by the details of 
the history (Fig. 44-2). If oral or pharyngeal dysphagia is suspected, 
a fluoroscopic swallow study, usually done by a swallow therapist, 
is the procedure of choice. Otolaryngoscopic and neurologic eval-
uation  also  can  be  important,  depending  on  the  circumstances. 
For suspected esophageal dysphagia, upper endoscopy is the single 
most useful test. Endoscopy allows better visualization of mucosal 
lesions than does barium radiography and also allows for procure-
ment of mucosal biopsies. Endoscopic or histologic abnormalities 
are evident in the leading causes of esophageal dysphagia: Schatzki’s 
ring, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and eosinophilic esophagitis. 
Furthermore,  therapeutic  intervention  with  esophageal  dilation 
can  be  done  as  part  of  the  procedure  if  it  is  deemed  necessary. 
The  emergence  of  eosinophilic  esophagitis  as  a  leading  cause  of 
dysphagia in both children and adults has led to the recommenda-
tion that esophageal mucosal biopsies be obtained routinely in the

evaluation  of  unexplained  dysphagia  even  if  characteristic,  endo-
scopically  identified  esophageal  mucosal  features  are  absent.  For 
cases of suspected esophageal motility disorders, endoscopy is still 
the  appropriate  initial  evaluation  as  neoplastic  and  inflammatory 
conditions can secondarily produce patterns of either achalasia or 
esophageal spasm. Esophageal manometry is done if dysphagia is 
not adequately explained by endoscopy or to confirm the diagnosis 
of  a  suspected  esophageal  motor  disorder.  Barium  radiography 
can  provide  useful  adjunctive  information  in  cases  of  subtle  or 
complex  esophageal  strictures,  prior  esophageal  surgery,  esoph-
ageal  diverticula,  or  paraesophageal  herniation.  Use  of  a  barium 
tablet  in  conjunction  with  fluoroscopy  can  identify  strictures  and 
esophageal  motility  disorders  that  may  be  overlooked  with  liquid 
barium. In specific cases, computed tomography (CT) examination, 
esophageal manometry with solid meal challenge, and endoscopic 
ultrasonography may be useful.
TREATMENT
Treatment of dysphagia depends on both the locus and the specific 
etiology.  Oropharyngeal  dysphagia  most  commonly  results  from 
functional deficits caused by neurologic disorders. In such circum-
stances, the treatment focuses on utilizing postures or maneuvers 
devised to reduce pharyngeal residue and enhance airway protec-
tion learned under the direction of a swallow therapist. Aspiration 
risk  may  be  reduced  by  altering  the  consistency  of  ingested  food 
and  liquid.  Dysphagia  resulting  from  a  cerebrovascular  accident 
usually,  but  not  always,  spontaneously  improves  within  the  first 
few  weeks  after  the  event.  More  severe  and  persistent  cases  may 
require consideration of gastrostomy and enteral feeding. Patients 
with myasthenia gravis (Chap. 448) and polymyositis (Chap. 365) 
may respond to medical treatment of the primary neuromuscular 
disease.  Surgical  intervention  with  cricopharyngeal  myotomy  is 
usually  not  helpful,  with  the  exception  of  specific  disorders  such 
as  symptomatic  cricopharyngeal  bar,  Zenker’s  diverticulum,  and 
oculopharyngeal  muscular  dystrophy.  Chronic  neurologic  disor-
ders  such  as  Parkinson’s  disease  and  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis 
may  manifest  with  severe  oropharyngeal  dysphagia.  Feeding  by  a 
nasogastric tube or an endoscopically placed gastrostomy tube may 
be considered for nutritional support; however, these maneuvers do 
not  provide  protection  against  aspiration  of  salivary  secretions  or 
refluxed gastric contents.

Treatment  of  esophageal  dysphagia  is  covered  in  detail  in   

Chap.  323.  The  majority  of  causes  of  structural,  esophageal  dys-
phagia are effectively managed by means of esophageal dilation using 
bougie or balloon dilators. Cancer and achalasia are often managed 
surgically,  although  endoscopic  techniques  are  available  for  both 
palliation  and  primary  therapy,  respectively.  Infectious  etiologies 
respond  to  antimicrobial  medications  or  treatment  of  the  underly-
ing immunosuppressive state. Finally, eosinophilic esophagitis is an 
important  and  increasingly  recognized  cause  of  dysphagia  that  is 
amenable  to  treatment  by  elimination  of  dietary  allergens,  proton 
pump  inhibition  or  swallowed,  topically  acting  glucocorticoids  in 
combination with esophageal dilation for persistent strictures.

45 Nausea, Vomiting, and 
Indigestion
William L. Hasler

Nausea is the feeling of a need to vomit. Vomiting (emesis) is the oral 
expulsion of gastrointestinal contents resulting from gut and thoraco-
abdominal wall contractions. Vomiting is contrasted with regurgitation, 
the effortless passage of gastric contents into the mouth. Rumination 
is the repeated regurgitation of food residue, which may be rechewed 
and reswallowed. In contrast to emesis, these phenomena exhibit voli-
tional control. Indigestion encompasses a range of complaints including 
nausea, vomiting, heartburn, regurgitation, and dyspepsia (symptoms 
thought to originate in the gastroduodenal region). Some individuals 
with dyspepsia experience postprandial fullness, early satiety (inability 
to  complete  a  meal  due  to  premature  fullness),  bloating,  eructation 
(belching),  and  anorexia.  Others  report  predominantly  epigastric 
burning or pain. Nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia have been correlated 
with a condition now called avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.

NAUSEA AND VOMITING
 ■ MECHANISMS
Vomiting is coordinated by the brainstem and is effected by responses 
in the gut, pharynx, and somatic musculature. Mechanisms underlying 
nausea  are  poorly  understood  but  likely  involve  the  cerebral  cortex, 
as  nausea  requires  cognitive  and  emotional  input  and  is  associated 
with  autonomic  responses  including  diaphoresis,  pallor,  and  altered 
heart rate. Functional brain imaging studies support this idea showing 
activation  of  cerebral  regions  including  the  insula,  anterior  cingulate 
cortex, and amygdala during nausea.

Coordination  of  Emesis  Brainstem  nuclei—including  the 
nucleus tractus solitarius; dorsal vagal and phrenic nuclei; medullary 
nuclei regulating respiration; and nuclei that control pharyngeal, facial, 
and  tongue  movements—coordinate  initiation  of  emesis  involving 
neurokinin NK1, serotonin 5-HT3, endocannabinoid, and vasopressin 
pathways.

Somatic and visceral muscles respond stereotypically during emesis. 
Inspiratory thoracic and abdominal wall muscles contract, increasing 
intrathoracic  and  intraabdominal  pressures  to  evacuate  the  stomach. 
Under normal conditions, distally migrating gut contractions are coor-
dinated by an electrical phenomenon, the slow wave, which cycles at  
3  cycles/min  in  the  stomach  and  11  cycles/min  in  the  duodenum. 
During emesis, slow waves are abolished and replaced by orally propa-
gating spikes that evoke retrograde contractions to facilitate expulsion 
of gut contents.

Activators  of  Emesis  Emetic  stimuli  act  at  several  sites.  Eme-
sis  evoked  by  unpleasant  thoughts  or  smells  originates  in  the  brain. 
Motion sickness and inner ear disorders act on labyrinthine pathways. 
Gastric  irritants  and  cytotoxic  agents  like  cisplatin  stimulate  gastro-
duodenal  vagal  afferent  nerves.  Nongastric  afferents  are  activated  by 
bowel obstruction and mesenteric ischemia. The area postrema, in the 
medulla, responds to bloodborne stimuli (emetogenic drugs, bacterial 
toxins, uremia, hypoxia, ketoacidosis) and is termed the chemoreceptor 
trigger zone.

Neurotransmitters  mediating  vomiting  are  selective  for  different 
sites.  Labyrinthine  disorders  stimulate  vestibular  muscarinic  M1  and 
histaminergic  H1  receptors.  Vagal  afferent  stimuli  activate  5-HT3 
receptors. The area postrema is served by nerves acting on 5-HT3, M1, 
H1, and dopamine D2 subtypes. NK1 receptors in the central nervous 
system  (CNS)  mediate  both  nausea  and  vomiting.  Cannabinoid  CB1 
pathways may participate in the cerebral cortex and brainstem. Thera-
pies for vomiting act on these receptor-mediated pathways.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Nausea and vomiting are caused by conditions within and outside the 
gut,  drugs,  and  circulating  toxins  (Table  45-1).  Unexplained  chronic 
nausea and vomiting is reported by 2–3% of the population.

Intraperitoneal Disorders  Obstruction and inflammation of hol-
low and solid viscera may elicit vomiting. Ulcers and malignancy cause 
gastric  obstruction,  while  adhesions,  benign  or  malignant  tumors, 
volvulus,  intussusception,  or  inflammatory  diseases  like  Crohn’s  dis-
ease  cause  small  intestinal  and  colonic  obstruction.  The  superior 
mesenteric artery syndrome, occurring after weight loss or prolonged 
bed rest, results when the duodenum is compressed by the overlying 
superior  mesenteric  artery.  Median  arcuate  ligament  syndrome,  with 
compression of the celiac artery, is a rare cause of vomiting. Abdominal 
irradiation  impairs  intestinal  motility  and  induces  strictures.  Biliary 
colic causes nausea by acting on afferent nerves. Vomiting with pancre-
atitis, cholecystitis, and appendicitis results from visceral irritation and 
induction of ileus. Enteric infectious causes of vomiting include viruses 
(norovirus, rotavirus), bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus), 
and opportunistic organisms like cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex in 
immunocompromised individuals.

Gut  sensorimotor  dysfunction  often  causes  nausea  and  vomiting. 
Gastroparesis presents with these symptoms with evidence of delayed 
gastric  emptying  and  occurs  after  vagotomy  or  with  pancreatic  car-
cinoma,  mesenteric  vascular  insufficiency,  or  organic  diseases  like 
diabetes, scleroderma, and amyloidosis. Idiopathic gastroparesis is the 
most  prevalent  etiology;  it  occurs  in  the  absence  of  systemic  illness 
and follow a viral illness in ∼15–20% of cases. Rapid gastric emptying 

is associated with nausea and vomiting in some conditions. Intestinal 
pseudoobstruction  is  characterized  by  disrupted  intestinal  motility 
with  retention  of  food  residue  and  secretions;  bacterial  overgrowth; 
nutrient malabsorption; and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, bloating, 
pain, and altered defecation. Intestinal pseudoobstruction may be idio-
pathic, inherited, result from systemic disease like scleroderma or an 
infiltrative process like amyloidosis, or occur as a paraneoplastic con-
sequence of malignancy (e.g., small-cell lung carcinoma). Patients with 
gastroesophageal  reflux,  irritable  bowel  syndrome  (IBS),  or  chronic 
constipation often report nausea and vomiting.

Other functional gastroduodenal disorders without organic abnor-
malities  have  been  characterized.  Chronic  nausea  vomiting  syndrome 
is  defined  as  bothersome  nausea  at  least  1  day  and/or  one  or  more 
vomiting  episodes  weekly  in  the  absence  of  an  eating  disorder  or 
psychiatric disease. Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) causes 3–14% of 
cases of unexplained nausea and vomiting and presents with discrete 
episodes of relentless vomiting and is associated with migraines. Some 
adult cases have been associated with rapid gastric emptying. A related 
condition,  cannabinoid  hyperemesis  syndrome  (CHS),  presents  with 
cyclical vomiting in individuals (mostly men) with long-standing use 
of  large  quantities  of  cannabis  and  resolves  with  its  discontinuation. 
Rumination syndrome is often misdiagnosed as refractory vomiting.
Extraperitoneal Disorders  Myocardial infarction and congestive 
heart  failure  may  cause  nausea  and  vomiting.  Postoperative  emesis 
occurs  after  25%  of  surgeries,  especially  abdominal  and  orthope-
dic  surgery.  Increased  intracranial  pressure  from  tumors,  bleeding, 
abscess, or blockage of cerebrospinal fluid outflow produces vomiting 
with or without nausea. Patients with anorexia nervosa, bulimia ner-
vosa, anxiety, and depression often report significant nausea associated 
with delayed gastric emptying.

Medications  and  Metabolic  Disorders  Drugs  evoke  vomiting 
by action on the stomach (analgesics, erythromycin) or area postrema 
(opioids,  anti-parkinsonian  drugs).  Other  emetogenic  agents  include 
antibiotics,  cardiac  antiarrhythmics,  antihypertensives,  oral  hypogly-
cemics,  antidepressants  (selective  serotonin  and  serotonin  norepi-
nephrine  reuptake  inhibitors),  smoking  cessation  drugs  (varenicline, 
nicotine),  and  contraceptives.  Cancer  chemotherapy  causes  acute 
(within  hours  of  administration),  delayed  (after  1  or  more  days),  or 
anticipatory  vomiting.  Acute  emesis  from  highly  emetogenic  agents 
(e.g., cisplatin) is mediated by 5-HT3 pathways. Delayed emesis is more 
dependent on NK1 mechanisms. Anticipatory nausea may respond to 
anxiolytic therapy rather than antiemetics.

Metabolic disorders elicit nausea and vomiting. Nausea affects 70% 
of women in the first trimester of pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum 
is a severe form of nausea of pregnancy that produces dehydration and 
electrolyte disturbances and has been proposed to result from excessive 
amounts of a blood protein—growth differentiation factor 15. Uremia, 
ketoacidosis,  adrenal  insufficiency,  and  parathyroid  and  thyroid  dis-
ease are other metabolic etiologies.

Circulating  toxins  evoke  emesis  via  effects  on  the  area  postrema. 
Endogenous  toxins  are  generated  in  fulminant  liver  failure,  whereas 
exogenous enterotoxins may be produced by enteric bacterial infection. 
Ethanol intoxication is a common toxic etiology of nausea and vomiting.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Nausea and Vomiting 

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The  history  helps  define  the  etiology  of  nausea  and  vomiting. 
Drugs, toxins, and infections often cause acute symptoms, whereas 
established  illnesses  evoke  chronic  complaints.  Gastroparesis  and 
pyloric obstruction elicit vomiting within an hour of eating. Emesis 
from intestinal blockage occurs later. Vomiting occurring minutes 
after meal consumption prompts consideration of rumination syn-
drome. With severe gastric emptying delays, vomitus may contain 
food  residue  ingested  days  before.  Hematemesis  raises  suspicion

of  ulcer,  malignancy,  or  Mallory-Weiss  tear.  Feculent  emesis  is 
noted with distal intestinal or colonic obstruction. Bilious vomiting 
excludes gastric obstruction, whereas emesis of undigested food is 
consistent with a Zenker’s diverticulum or achalasia. Vomiting can 
relieve abdominal pain from a bowel obstruction but has no effect 
in  pancreatitis  or  cholecystitis.  Weight  loss  raises  concern  about 
malignancy.  Taking  prolonged  hot  baths  or  showers  is  associated 
with CHS and CVS. Intracranial sources are considered if there are 
headaches or visual changes. Vertigo or tinnitus indicates labyrin-
thine disease.

The physical examination complements the history. Orthostatic 
hypotension  and  reduced  skin  turgor  indicate  intravascular  fluid 
loss. Pulmonary abnormalities raise concern for aspiration of vom-
itus. Bowel sounds are absent with ileus. High-pitched rushes sug-
gest bowel obstruction, whereas a succussion splash is found with 
gastroparesis  or  pyloric  obstruction.  Involuntary  guarding  raises 
suspicion of inflammation. Fecal blood suggests ulcer, ischemia, or 
tumor.  Neurologic  disease  presents  with  papilledema,  visual  loss, 
or  focal  neural  abnormalities.  Neoplasm  is  suggested  by  palpable 
masses or adenopathy. 

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
For intractable symptoms or an elusive diagnosis, screening testing 
can direct care. Electrolyte replacement is indicated for hypokalemia 
or metabolic alkalosis. Iron-deficiency anemia mandates exclusion 
of mucosal causes. Abnormal pancreatic or liver biochemistries are 
found  with  pancreaticobiliary  disease.  Endocrinologic,  rheuma-
tologic,  or  paraneoplastic  etiologies  are  suggested  by  hormone  or 
serologic abnormalities. Supine and upright abdominal radiographs 
may  show  intestinal  air-fluid  levels  and  reduced  colonic  air  with 
small-bowel obstruction. Ileus is characterized by diffusely dilated 
air-filled bowel loops.

Anatomic studies are indicated if initial testing is nondiagnostic. 
Upper  endoscopy  detects  ulcers,  malignancy,  and  retained  food  in 
gastroparesis. Small-bowel barium radiography or computed tomog-
raphy  (CT)  diagnoses  partial  bowel  obstruction.  Colonoscopy  or 
contrast enema radiography detects colonic obstruction. Ultrasound 
or CT defines intraperitoneal inflammation; CT and magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) enterography define inflammation in Crohn’s 
disease. Brain CT or MRI delineates intracranial disease. Mesenteric 
angiography, CT, or MRI is useful for suspected ischemia.

Gastrointestinal motility testing can detect an underlying motor 
disorder.  Gastroparesis  commonly  is  diagnosed  by  gastric  scintig-
raphy, which measures emptying of a radiolabeled meal. A nonra-
dioactive 13C-labeled gastric emptying breath test is an alternative to 
scintigraphy.  Intestinal  pseudoobstruction  is  suggested  by  luminal 
dilation on imaging or abnormal transit on contrast radiography or 
intestinal scintigraphy. Wireless motility capsules diagnose gastropa-
resis  or  small-bowel  dysmotility  by  detecting  local  or  generalized 
transit delays in the stomach or small bowel from characteristic pH 
changes  between  regions.  Small-intestinal  manometry  confirms  a 
diagnosis  of  pseudoobstruction  and  discriminates  between  neuro-
pathic or myopathic disease based on contractile patterns. Manom-
etry  can  obviate  the  need  for  surgical  intestinal  biopsy  to  detect 
smooth  muscle  or  neuronal  degeneration.  Combined  ambulatory 
esophageal pH/impedance testing and high-resolution manometry 
facilitates diagnosis of rumination syndrome. Impedance planimetry 
detects reduced pyloric distensibility in some cases of gastroparesis.

TREATMENT
Nausea and Vomiting 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Therapy of vomiting is tailored to correct remediable abnormalities 
if possible. Patients with severe dehydration should be hospitalized 
if  oral  fluid  replenishment  is  unsustainable.  Once  oral  intake  is 

tolerated, low-fat liquid nutrients are restarted because lipids delay 
gastric  emptying.  Low-residue,  small-particle  diets  have  shown 
efficacy in gastroparesis. Glycemic control should be optimized to 
reduce diabetic gastroparesis symptoms.

ANTIEMETIC MEDICATIONS
Most  antiemetic  agents  act  on  CNS  sites  (Table  45-2).  Antihista-
mines like dimenhydrinate and meclizine and anticholinergics like 
scopolamine  act  on  vestibular  pathways  to  treat  motion  sickness 
and labyrinthine disorders. D2 antagonists treat emesis evoked by 
area postrema stimuli including medications, toxins, and metabolic 
disturbances. Dopamine antagonists cross the blood-brain barrier 
and  cause  anxiety,  movement  disorders,  and  hyperprolactinemic 
effects (galactorrhea, sexual dysfunction).

Other  classes  exhibit  antiemetic  properties.  5-HT3  antagonists 
like ondansetron and granisetron prevent postoperative vomiting, 
radiation  therapy–induced  symptoms,  and  cancer  chemotherapy– 
induced emesis, but also are used for other conditions. NK1 antag-
onists  like  aprepitant  are  approved  for  chemotherapy-induced 
vomiting.  Aprepitant  reduces  gastroparesis  symptoms.  Tricyclic 
antidepressants reduce symptoms in some patients with functional 
causes of vomiting, but did not show benefits in a controlled trial 
in  gastroparesis.  Other  antidepressants  such  as  mirtazapine  and 
olanzapine and the pain-modulating agent gabapentin also exhibit 
antiemetic effects in some clinical settings. 

GASTROINTESTINAL MOTOR STIMULANTS
Drugs  that  stimulate  gastric  emptying  are  used  for  gastroparesis 
(Table  45-2).  Metoclopramide,  a  combined  5-HT4  agonist  and  D2 
antagonist, is effective in gastroparesis, but antidopaminergic side 
effects,  including  dystonias  and  mood  disturbances,  limit  use  in 
∼25%  of  cases.  Erythromycin  increases  gastroduodenal  motility 
by action on receptors for motilin, an endogenous transmitter that 
regulates  fasting  motility.  Intravenous  erythromycin  is  useful  for 
inpatients with refractory gastroparesis. Benefits of long-term oral 
erythromycin  are  limited  by  development  of  tolerance.  Domperi-
done,  a  D2  antagonist  not  available  in  the  United  States,  exhibits 
prokinetic and antiemetic effects but does not cross into most brain 
regions. The drug rarely causes dystonic reactions but can induce 
hyperprolactinemic side effects via penetration of pituitary regions 
served  by  a  porous  blood-brain  barrier.  Prucalopride,  a  5-HT4 
agonist,  has  shown  efficacy  in  accelerating  gastric  emptying  and 
improving symptoms in idiopathic gastroparesis.

Refractory  motility  disorders  pose  challenges.  Intestinal  pseu-
doobstruction may respond to the somatostatin analogue octreotide, 
which induces propagative small-intestinal motor complexes. Acet-
ylcholinesterase inhibitors like pyridostigmine benefit some patients 
with  small-bowel  dysmotility.  Pyloric  botulinum  toxin  injections 
reduced gastroparesis symptoms in uncontrolled studies, but small 
controlled  trials  observed  benefits  no  greater  than  sham  treat-
ments.  Surgical  pyloroplasty  and  gastric  peroral  endoscopic  myot-
omy (G-POEM) of the pylorus improved symptoms in case series. 
Enteral feedings through a jejunostomy reduce hospitalizations and 
improve overall health in some patients with refractory gastropare-
sis. Subtotal gastric resection may improve some cases of postvago-
tomy  gastroparesis,  but  its  utility  for  other  gastroparesis  etiologies 
is  unproven.  Implanted  gastric  electrical  stimulators  may  reduce 
symptoms, enhance nutrition, improve quality of life, and decrease 
health  care  expenditures  in  medication-refractory  gastroparesis;  a 
controlled trial has confirmed modest improvement in vomiting. 

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Safety concerns have been raised about selected antiemetics. Meto-
clopramide  can  cause  irreversible  movement  disorders  like  tardive 
dyskinesia, particularly in older patients. This complication should 
be  explained  and  documented  in  the  medical  record.  Domperi-
done, erythromycin, tricyclic antidepressants, and 5-HT3 antagonists 
increase  risk  of  cardiac  arrhythmias  and  sudden  cardiac  death  in

those with QTc interval prolongation on electrocardiography (ECG). 
Surveillance ECG testing is advocated for some of these agents. 
OTHER CLINICAL SETTINGS
Some  cancer  chemotherapies  are  intensely  emetogenic  (Chap.  73). 
Combining a 5-HT3 antagonist, an NK1 antagonist, and a glucocorticoid 
can control both acute and delayed vomiting after highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy.  Benzodiazepines  like  lorazepam  reduce  anticipatory 
nausea and vomiting. Other therapies with benefit in chemotherapy- 
induced  emesis  include  cannabinoids,  olanzapine,  gabapentin,  and 
alternative  therapies  like  ginger.  Most  antiemetic  regimens  produce 
greater reductions in chemotherapy-induced vomiting than nausea.

Clinicians  should  exercise  caution  in  managing  nausea  of  preg-
nancy.  Studies  of  the  teratogenic  effects  of  antiemetic  agents  provide 
conflicting results. Antihistamines like meclizine and doxylamine, anti-
dopaminergics like prochlorperazine, and antiserotonergics like ondan-
setron  demonstrate  limited  efficacy.  Some  obstetricians  recommend 
alternative therapies including pyridoxine, acupressure, or ginger.

Managing  CVS  and  CHS  is  challenging.  Prophylaxis  with  tri-
cyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants (topiramate, zonisamide, 
levetiracetam)  reduces  the  severity  and  frequency  of  CVS  attacks 
in uncontrolled reports. Combining intravenous 5-HT3 antagonists 
with  the  sedating  effects  of  a  benzodiazepine  like  lorazepam  are 
mainstays  for  aborting  acute  flares.  Small  studies  report  benefits 
with aprepitant and injectable or intranasal forms of the 5-HT1 ago-
nist sumatriptan to manage acute CVS episodes. These treatments 
are  reportedly  less  effective  for  CHS,  but  haloperidol  and  topical 
capsaicin cream may reduce acute CHS attacks.

INDIGESTION
 ■ MECHANISMS
Several mechanisms may contribute to indigestion, including acid reflux, 
altered gut motility or sensation, inflammation, and microbial processes.

Gastroesophageal  Reflux  Gastroesophageal  reflux  results  from 
many  defects.  Reduced  lower  esophageal  sphincter  (LES)  tone  causes 
reflux in scleroderma and pregnancy and may be a factor in some patients 
without systemic illness. Other cases exhibit frequent transient LES relax-
ations  (TLESRs).  Reductions  in  esophageal  body  motility  or  saliva  pro-
duction prolong esophageal fluid clearance. Increased intragastric pressure 
promotes gastroesophageal reflux with obesity. Many reflux patients have 
hiatal hernias, and large hernias can increase symptomatic reflux.
Gastric Motor Dysfunction  Disturbed gastric motility may con-
tribute to gastroesophageal reflux in up to one-third of cases. Delayed 
gastric emptying is found in ∼30% of functional dyspeptics, while rapid 
gastric  emptying  affects  5%.  Impaired  gastric  fundus  relaxation  after 
eating  (i.e.,  accommodation)  may  underlie  selected  dyspeptic  symp-
toms  like  bloating,  nausea,  and  early  satiety  in  ∼40%  of  patients  and 
may predispose to TLESRs and acid reflux.

Visceral Afferent Hypersensitivity  Disturbed gastric sensation 
is  another  pathogenic  factor  in  functional  dyspepsia.  Approximately 
35%  of  dyspeptic  patients  note  discomfort  with  fundic  distention  to 
lower pressures than in healthy controls. Other individuals with dys-
pepsia exhibit hypersensitivity to chemical stimulation of the stomach 
with capsaicin or with duodenal acid or lipid perfusion. Some cases of 
functional heartburn without increased acid or nonacid reflux exhibit 
heightened perception of normal esophageal acidity.
Immune Activation 
Increases in duodenal epithelial permeability 
in functional dyspepsia may relate to increases in eosinophils and mast 
cells  adjacent  to  submucosal  neurons.  Increased  activation  of  these 
cells is proposed to contribute to gastric emptying delays and altered 
sensory  function  in  functional  dyspepsia  and  may  selectively  elicit 
early  satiety  and  epigastric  pain.  Proliferations  in  duodenal  bacteria 
were  shown  to  correlate  with  meal-induced  symptoms  in  functional 
dyspepsia,  suggesting  a  role  for  microbiome  alterations.  Intestinal 
bile salt release also is proposed to worsen dyspeptic symptoms after

eating. Both dysbiosis and bile may contribute to mucosal permeability 
defects.

Other  Factors  Helicobacter  pylori  has  a  proven  etiologic  role  in 
peptic ulcer disease but is a minor factor in the genesis of functional 
dyspepsia. Anxiety and depression may play contributing roles in some 
functional  dyspepsia  cases.  Functional  MRI  studies  show  increased 
activation  of  several  brain  regions,  emphasizing  CNS  contributions. 
Up to 20% of functional dyspepsia patients report symptom onset after 
a  viral  illness,  suggesting  an  infectious  trigger.  Analgesics  cause  dys-
pepsia, whereas nitrates, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, and 
progesterone  promote  gastroesophageal  reflux.  Ethanol,  tobacco,  and 
caffeine induce LES relaxation and reflux. Genetic factors predispose 
to development of reflux and dyspepsia in some cases.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Gastroesophageal  Reflux  Disease  Heartburn  or  regurgitation 
is  reported  weekly  by  18–28%  of  the  population,  highlighting  the 
prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Most cases of 
heartburn  result  from  excess  acid  reflux,  but  reflux  of  weakly  acidic 
or  nonacidic  fluid  can  produce  similar  symptoms.  Alkaline  reflux 
esophagitis elicits GERD symptoms in patients who have had surgery 
for peptic ulcer disease. Ten percent of patients with heartburn exhibit 
no  acidic  or  nonacidic  esophageal  reflux  and  are  considered  to  have 
functional heartburn.

Functional  Dyspepsia  Approximately  20%  of  the  populace  has 
dyspepsia  at  least  six  times  yearly,  but  only  10–20%  present  to  clini-
cians. Functional dyspepsia, the cause of symptoms in 70–80% of dys-
peptic  patients,  is  defined  as  bothersome  postprandial  fullness,  early 
satiety, or epigastric pain or burning with symptom onset ≥6 months 
before diagnosis in the absence of organic cause. Functional dyspep-
sia is subdivided into postprandial distress syndrome (61% of cases), 
characterized by meal-induced fullness and early satiety, and epigastric 
pain syndrome (18% of cases), with epigastric pain or burning that may 
or may not be meal related. Twenty-one percent of individuals present 
with overlapping postprandial distress and epigastric pain syndromes. 
Functional dyspepsia is associated with other functional gut disorders 
including irritable bowel syndrome and nongastrointestinal disorders 
like  fibromyalgia,  chronic  fatigue,  and  anxiety.  Most  cases  follow  a 
benign  course,  but  some  with  H.  pylori  infection  or  on  nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) develop ulcers.

Ulcer  Disease  Most  GERD  patients  do  not  exhibit  esophageal 
injury, but 5% develop esophageal ulcers. Symptoms cannot distinguish 
nonerosive from erosive or ulcerative esophagitis. A minority of cases 
of dyspepsia stem from gastric or duodenal ulcers. The most common 
causes  of  ulcers  are  H.  pylori  infection  and  NSAID  use.  Other  rare 
causes  of  gastroduodenal  ulcers  include  Crohn’s  disease  (Chap.  326) 
and  Zollinger-Ellison  syndrome  (Chap.  324),  resulting  from  gastrin 
overproduction by an endocrine tumor.

Malignancy  Dyspeptic  patients  may  seek  care  because  of  fear  of 
cancer,  but  few  cases  result  from  malignancy.  Esophageal  squamous 
cell carcinoma occurs most often with long-standing tobacco or eth-
anol intake. Other risks include prior caustic ingestion, achalasia, and 
the  hereditary  disorder  tylosis.  Esophageal  adenocarcinoma  usually 
complicates  prolonged  acid  reflux.  Eight  to  20%  of  GERD  patients 
exhibit  esophageal  intestinal  metaplasia,  termed  Barrett’s  metaplasia, 
which predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma (Chap. 80). Gastric 
malignancies  include  adenocarcinoma,  which  is  prevalent  in  certain 
Asian societies, and lymphoma.

Other Causes  Opportunistic fungal or viral esophageal infections 
may  produce  heartburn  but  more  often  cause  odynophagia.  Other 
causes  of  esophageal  inflammation  include  eosinophilic  esophagitis 
and pill esophagitis. Biliary colic is a potential cause unexplained upper 
abdominal  pain,  but  most  patients  report  discrete  acute  episodes  of 
right upper quadrant or epigastric pain rather than chronic burning or 
fullness. Twenty percent of gastroparesis patients note a predominance

of pain rather than nausea and vomiting. Intestinal lactase deficiency 
may cause gas, bloating, and discomfort and occurs more commonly 
in  blacks  and  Asians.  Intolerance  of  other  carbohydrates  (e.g.,  fruc-
tose,  sorbitol)  produces  similar  symptoms.  Small-intestinal  bacterial 
overgrowth may cause dyspepsia, as well as bowel dysfunction, disten-
tion,  and  malabsorption.  Celiac  disease,  nonceliac  gluten  sensitivity, 
pancreatic  disease  (chronic  pancreatitis,  malignancy),  hepatocellular 
carcinoma, Ménétrier’s disease, infiltrative diseases (sarcoidosis, mas-
tocytosis,  eosinophilic  gastroenteritis),  mesenteric  ischemia,  thyroid 
and  parathyroid  disease,  and  abdominal  wall  strain  cause  dyspepsia. 
Extraperitoneal etiologies of indigestion include congestive heart fail-
ure and tuberculosis.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Indigestion 

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Managing indigestion requires a thorough interview. GERD classi-
cally produces heartburn, a substernal warmth that moves toward 
the neck. Heartburn often is exacerbated by meals and may awaken 
the patient. Associated symptoms include regurgitation of acid or 
nonacidic fluid and water brash, the reflex release of salty saliva into 
the mouth. Atypical symptoms include pharyngitis, asthma, cough, 
bronchitis,  hoarseness,  and  chest  pain  that  mimics  angina.  Some 
patients with acid reflux on esophageal pH testing note abdominal 
pain instead of heartburn.

Dyspeptic patients report symptoms referable to the upper abdo-
men that may be meal-related (postprandial distress syndrome) or 
independent of food ingestion (epigastric pain syndrome). The his-
tory in functional dyspepsia may also report symptoms of GERD, 
IBS, or idiopathic gastroparesis.

The physical exam with GERD and functional dyspepsia usually 
is  normal.  In  atypical  GERD,  pharyngeal  erythema  and  wheezing 
may  be  noted.  Recurrent  regurgitation  may  cause  poor  dentition. 
Dyspeptics may exhibit epigastric tenderness or distention.

Discriminating  functional  from  organic  causes  of  indigestion 
mandates excluding certain historic and exam features. Odynophagia 
suggests esophageal infection. Dysphagia is concerning for a benign 
or  malignant  esophageal  blockage.  Other  alarm  features  include 
unexplained  weight  loss,  recurrent  vomiting,  dysphagia,  occult  or 
gross bleeding, nocturnal symptoms, jaundice, palpable mass or ade-
nopathy, and a family history of gastrointestinal neoplasm. Patients 
with an abdominal wall source of upper abdominal pain may exhibit 
a  positive  Carnett’s  sign  of  increased  tenderness  with  tensing  of 
abdominal muscles upon lifting the head from the exam table. 

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Because indigestion is prevalent and most cases result from GERD 
or  functional  dyspepsia,  it  is  generally  recommended  to  perform 
no  more  than  limited  and  directed  diagnostic  testing  in  most 
individuals.

After excluding alarm factors (Table 45-3), patients with typical 
GERD do not need further evaluation and are treated empirically. 
Upper  endoscopy  is  indicated  only  in  cases  with  atypical  symp-
toms  or  these  alarm  factors.  For  heartburn  >5  years  in  duration,

especially  in  patients  >50  years  old,  endoscopy  is  advocated  to 
screen for Barrett’s metaplasia. Endoscopy is not needed in low-risk 
patients who respond to acid suppressants. Ambulatory esophageal 
pH testing using a catheter method or a wireless capsule endoscop-
ically attached to the esophageal wall is considered for drug-refrac-
tory symptoms and atypical symptoms like unexplained chest pain. 
High-resolution  esophageal  manometry  is  ordered  when  surgical 
treatment of GERD is considered. A low LES pressure predicts fail-
ure of drug therapy and provides a rationale to proceed to surgery. 
Poor esophageal body peristalsis raises concern about postoperative 
dysphagia and directs the choice of surgical technique. Nonacidic 
reflux  may  be  detected  by  combined  esophageal  impedance-pH 
testing in medication-unresponsive patients.

Upper endoscopy is recommended as the initial test in patients 
with  unexplained  dyspepsia  who  are  >60  years  old  to  exclude 
malignancy—a  finding  in  only  0.3%  of  endoscopies  performed 
for  uninvestigated  dyspepsia.  Management  of  patients  <60  years 
old depends on the local H. pylori prevalence. In regions with low 
prevalence (<10%), a 4-week trial of an acid-suppressing medica-
tion  such  as  a  proton  pump  inhibitor  (PPI)  is  recommended.  If 
empiric  acid  suppression  fails,  a  “test  and  treat”  approach  for  H. 
pylori  status  is  initiated  with  urea  breath  testing  or  stool  antigen 
measurement. Those who are H. pylori positive are given therapy 
to  eradicate  infection.  For  patients  in  areas  with  high  H.  pylori 
prevalence (>10%), an initial “test and treat” approach is advocated, 
and empiric PPI therapy is reserved for those who are negative for 
infection or who fail to respond to H. pylori treatment. Patients who 
are treated for H. pylori should undergo confirmation of eradication 
with repeat urea breath testing or fecal antigen testing 4–6 weeks 
after completing therapy. Those under age 60 only warrant upper 
endoscopy  if  their  symptoms  fail  to  respond  to  these  therapies. 
Some  advocate  initial  endoscopy  for  patients  <60  years  old  who 
report alarm symptoms, but some guidelines have not endorsed this 
practice unless symptoms persist despite treatment.

Further  testing  is  indicated  in  some  settings.  For  suspected 
bleeding, a blood count can exclude anemia. Thyroid chemistries 
or calcium levels screen for metabolic disease. Specific serologies 
may  suggest  celiac  disease.  Pancreatic  and  liver  chemistries  are 
obtained  for  suspected  pancreaticobiliary  causes,  which  are  fur-
ther investigated with ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Gastric emptying 
testing is considered to exclude gastroparesis for dyspeptic symp-
toms resembling postprandial distress when therapy fails. Breath 
testing  after  carbohydrate  ingestion  detects  lactase  deficiency, 
intolerance  to  other  carbohydrates,  or  small-intestinal  bacterial 
overgrowth.

TREATMENT
Indigestion 

LIFESTYLE, DIET, AND NONMEDICATION 
RECOMMENDATIONS
Patients  with  mild  indigestion  can  be  reassured  that  a  careful 
evaluation  revealed  no  serious  disease  and  are  offered  no  other 
intervention.  If  possible,  drugs  that  cause  gastroesophageal  reflux 
or dyspepsia should be stopped. GERD patients should limit eth-
anol, caffeine, chocolate, and tobacco use and can ingest a low-fat 
diet, avoid snacks before bedtime, and elevate the head of the bed. 
Functional  dyspepsia  patients  can  be  advised  to  reduce  intake  of 
fat,  spicy  foods,  caffeine,  and  alcohol.  Dietary  lactose  restriction 
is appropriate for lactase deficiency, while gluten exclusion is indi-
cated for celiac disease. Low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccha-
ride, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyol) diets are effective 
for  gaseous  symptoms  in  IBS.  In  a  systematic  review,  FODMAP 
intake correlated with functional dyspepsia symptoms, suggesting 
potential utility in this disorder as well. 

ACID-SUPPRESSING OR -NEUTRALIZING MEDICATIONS
Drugs  that  reduce  or  neutralize  gastric  acid  are  often  prescribed 
for  GERD.  Histamine  H2  antagonists  like  cimetidine,  ranitidine, 
famotidine, and nizatidine are useful in mild to moderate GERD. 
For  severe  symptoms  or  for  many  cases  of  erosive  or  ulcerative 
esophagitis,  PPIs  like  omeprazole,  lansoprazole,  rabeprazole,  pan-
toprazole,  esomeprazole,  or  dexlansoprazole  are  needed.  These 
drugs inhibit gastric H+, K+-ATPase and are more potent than H2 
antagonists.  Up  to  one-third  of  GERD  patients  do  not  respond 
to standard PPI doses; one-third of these patients have nonacidic 
reflux, whereas 10% have persistent acid-related disease. Heartburn 
responds better to PPI therapy than regurgitation or atypical GERD 
symptoms. Some individuals respond to doubling of the PPI dose 
or adding an H2 antagonist. Complications of long-term PPI ther-
apy  include  diarrhea  (Clostridium  difficile  infection,  microscopic 
colitis),  small-intestinal  bacterial  overgrowth,  nutrient  deficiency 
(vitamin  B12,  iron,  calcium),  hypomagnesemia,  bone  demineral-
ization, interstitial nephritis, and impaired medication absorption 
(clopidogrel). Many patients started on a PPI can be stepped down 
to an H2 antagonist or switched to on-demand use.

Acid  suppressants  also  are  effective  for  both  the  postprandial 
distress  and  epigastric  pain  subtypes  of  functional  dyspepsia.  A 
meta-analysis of 18 controlled trials calculated a risk ratio of 0.88, 
with a 95% confidence interval of 0.82–0.94, favoring PPI therapy 
over placebo in functional dyspepsia. H2 antagonists also improve 
symptoms  in  functional  dyspepsia,  but  a  guideline  has  advocated 
PPIs over H2 antagonists as first-line therapies for functional dys-
pepsia.  In  addition  to  acid  suppression,  PPIs  may  have  the  addi-
tional action of reducing duodenal eosinophil counts in dyspepsia.
Antacids  are  useful  for  short-term  control  of  mild  GERD  but 
have  less  benefit  in  severe  cases  unless  given  at  high  doses  that 
cause side effects (diarrhea and constipation with magnesium- and 
aluminum-containing agents, respectively). Alginic acid combined 
with  antacids  forms  a  floating  barrier  to  reflux  in  patients  with 
upright  symptoms.  Sucralfate,  a  salt  of  aluminum  hydroxide  and 
sucrose octasulfate that buffers acid and binds pepsin and bile salts, 
shows efficacy in GERD similar to H2 antagonists. 

HELICOBACTER PYLORI ERADICATION
H.  pylori  eradication  is  indicated  for  peptic  ulcer  and  mucosa- 
associated  lymphoid  tissue  gastric  lymphoma.  The  benefits  of 
eradication  therapy  in  functional  dyspepsia  are  limited  but  are 
statistically significant. A systematic review of 25 controlled trials 
calculated a pooled risk ratio of 1.24, with a 95% confidence inter-
val of 1.12–1.37, favoring H. pylori eradication over placebo. Most 
drug  combinations  (Chaps.  163  and  324)  include  7–14  days  of  a 
PPI  with  two  or  three  antibiotics  with  or  without  bismuth  prod-
ucts.  H.  pylori  infection  is  associated  with  reduced  prevalence  of 
GERD. However, eradication of infection does not worsen GERD 
symptoms.  No  consensus  recommendations  regarding  H.  pylori 
eradication in GERD patients have been offered. 

AGENTS THAT MODIFY GASTROINTESTINAL MOTOR 
ACTIVITY
The  γ-aminobutyric  acid  B  (GABA-B)  agonist  baclofen  reduces 
esophageal  exposure  to  acid  and  nonacidic  fluids  by  reducing 
TLESRs by 40%. This drug can be used in patients with refractory 
acid or nonacid reflux. Several studies have promoted the efficacy 
of  agents  that  stimulate  gastric  emptying  in  functional  dyspepsia 
with  33%  relative  risk  reductions,  but  publication  bias  and  small 
sample  sizes  raise  questions  about  reported  benefits  of  these 
agents. Some clinicians suggest that patients with the postprandial 
distress  subtype  may  respond  preferentially  to  such  prokinetic 
drugs.  The  newer  5-HT4  agonist  prucalopride  was  reported  to 
reduce  symptoms  in  patients  with  idiopathic  gastroparesis,  but 
no  similar  studies  have  been  conducted  in  functional  dyspepsia. 
The  5-HT1A  agonists  buspirone  and  tandospirone  may  improve

gastric  accommodation.  Acotiamide  stimulates  gastric  emptying 
and augments accommodation by enhancing acetylcholine release 
via muscarinic receptor antagonism and acetylcholinesterase inhi-
bition.  This  agent  is  approved  for  functional  dyspepsia  in  Japan 
and India. 

ANTIDEPRESSANTS
Some  patients  with  refractory  functional  heartburn  may  respond 
to antidepressants in the tricyclic and selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SSRI) classes, although studies are limited. Their mecha-
nism of action may involve blunting of visceral pain processing in 
the brain. In a controlled trial in functional dyspepsia, the tricyclic 
drug  amitriptyline  produced  symptom  reductions,  whereas  the 
SSRI escitalopram had no benefit in a three-way comparison with 
placebo.  In  another  controlled  trial  in  functional  dyspepsia,  the 
antidepressant mirtazapine produced superior symptom reductions 
versus placebo. However, in a meta-analysis of 13 trials, SSRIs and 
serotonin-norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors  showed  no  benefits 
in functional dyspepsia. 

OTHER OPTIONS
Antireflux surgery (fundoplication) to enhance the barrier function 
of  the  LES  may  be  offered  to  GERD  patients  who  are  young  and 
require  lifelong  therapy,  have  typical  heartburn,  are  responsive  to 
PPIs, and show acid reflux on pH monitoring. Surgery also is effec-
tive  for  some  cases  of  nonacidic  reflux.  Individuals  who  respond 
less  well  to  fundoplication  include  those  with  atypical  symptoms, 
those who have functional heartburn without reflux on testing, or 
those  who  have  esophageal  body  motor  disturbances.  Dysphagia, 
gas-bloat syndrome, and gastroparesis are long-term complications 
of fundoplication; ∼60% develop recurrent GERD symptoms over 
time.  Magnetic  sphincter  augmentation  may  be  appropriate  for 
GERD  treatment,  while  endoscopic  radiofrequency  therapies  can 
be considered for some patients. Other endoscopic options includ-
ing transoral incisionless fundoplication, endoscopic stapling, and 
antireflux mucosectomy are not yet advocated.

Gas  and  bloating  are  bothersome  in  some  patients  with  indi-
gestion  and  are  difficult  to  treat.  Simethicone,  activated  charcoal, 
and alpha-galactosidase provide benefits in some cases. One trial 
suggested possible benefits of the nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaxi-
min in functional dyspepsia, while another reported improvement 
with the probiotic Lactobacillus gasseri. Herbal remedies like STW 
5  (Iberogast,  a  mixture  of  nine  herbal  agents)  and  formulations 
of caraway oil and menthol are useful in some dyspeptic patients. 
Psychological  treatments  (e.g.,  behavioral  therapy,  psychotherapy, 
hypnotherapy) may be offered for refractory functional dyspepsia; 
a  meta-analysis  of  four  trials  reported  benefits  in  patients  with 
persistent dyspepsia.

46 Diarrhea and  
Constipation
Michael Camilleri, Joseph A. Murray

Diarrhea  and  constipation  are  exceedingly  common  and,  together, 
exact an enormous toll in terms of mortality, morbidity, social incon-
venience,  loss  of  work  productivity,  and  consumption  of  medical 
resources.  Worldwide,  >1  billion  individuals  suffer  one  or  more  epi-
sodes  of  acute  diarrhea  each  year.  Among  the  100  million  persons 
affected  annually  by  acute  diarrhea  in  the  United  States,  nearly  half 
must restrict activities, 10% consult physicians, ~250,000 require hos-
pitalization, and ~5000 die (primarily the elderly). Updated 2014–2015 
annual  disease  burden  data  from  the  United  States  show  3.4  million 
annual clinic or emergency department visits, about 130,000 hospital 
admissions,  and  annual  economic  burden  to  society  (excluding  all 
costs  for  inflammatory  bowel  disease)  exceeding  $8  billion.  Acute 
infectious diarrhea remains one of the most common causes of mortal-
ity in developing countries, particularly among impoverished infants, 
accounting for 1.8 million deaths per year. Recurrent, acute diarrhea 
in children in tropical countries results in environmental enteropathy 
with long-term impacts on physical and intellectual development.

Constipation,  by  contrast,  is  rarely  associated  with  mortality  and 
is  exceedingly  common  in  developed  countries,  leading  to  frequent 
self-medication  and,  in  a  third  of  those,  to  medical  consultation. 
Annual disease burden data for 2014–2015 show about 5 million clinic 
or  emergency  department  visits  for  constipation  or  hemorrhoids, 
50,000 admissions to hospital, and average cost of $3500 per patient, 
about double that of controls in a nested controlled study.

Population statistics on chronic diarrhea and constipation are more 
uncertain,  perhaps  due  to  variable  definitions  and  reporting,  but  the 
frequency of these conditions is also high. U.S. population surveys put 
prevalence rates for chronic diarrhea at 2–7% and for chronic consti-
pation at 12–19%, with women being affected twice as often as men, 
reaching parity at 70 years of age. Diarrhea and constipation are among 
the most common patient complaints presenting in primary care and 
account for nearly 50% of referrals to gastroenterologists.

Although diarrhea and constipation may present as mere nuisance 
symptoms at one extreme, they can be severe or life threatening at the 
other.  Even  mild  symptoms  may  signal  a  serious  underlying  gastro-
intestinal (GI) lesion, such as colorectal cancer, or systemic disorder, 
such as thyroid disease. Given the heterogeneous causes and potential 
severity  of  these  common  complaints,  it  is  imperative  for  clinicians 
to  appreciate  the  pathophysiology,  etiologic  classification,  diagnostic 
strategies, and principles of management of diarrhea and constipation 
so that rational and cost-effective care can be delivered.

NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY
While the primary function of the small intestine is the digestion and 
assimilation  of  nutrients  from  food,  the  small  intestine  and  colon 
together  perform  important  functions  that  regulate  the  secretion 
and absorption of water and electrolytes, the storage and subsequent 
transport  of  intraluminal  contents  aborally,  and  the  salvage  of  some 
nutrients  that  are  not  absorbed  in  the  small  intestine  after  bacterial 
metabolism of carbohydrate allows salvage of short-chain fatty acids. 
The main motor functions are summarized in Table 46-1. Alterations 
in  fluid  and  electrolyte  handling  contribute  significantly  to  diarrhea. 
Alterations in motor and sensory functions of the colon result in highly 
prevalent syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic 
diarrhea, and chronic constipation.
 ■ NEURAL CONTROL
The small intestine and colon have intrinsic and extrinsic innervation. 
The intrinsic innervation, also called the enteric nervous system, com-
prises myenteric, submucosal, and mucosal neuronal layers. The func-
tion of these layers is modulated by interneurons through the actions

of  neurotransmitter  amines  or  peptides,  including  acetylcholine, 
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), opioids, norepinephrine, serotonin, 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and nitric oxide (NO). The myenteric 
plexus regulates smooth-muscle function through intermediary pace-
maker-like cells called the interstitial cells of Cajal, and the submucosal 
plexus  affects  secretion,  absorption,  and  mucosal  blood  flow.  The 
enteric nervous system receives input from the extrinsic nerves, but it 
is capable of independent control of these functions.

The extrinsic innervations of the small intestine and colon are part 
of the autonomic nervous system and also modulate motor and secre-
tory  functions.  The  parasympathetic  nerves  convey  visceral  sensory 
pathways  from  and  excitatory  pathways  to  the  small  intestine  and 
colon.  Parasympathetic  fibers  via  the  vagus  nerve  reach  the  small 
intestine and proximal colon along the branches of the superior mesen-
teric  artery.  The  distal  colon  is  supplied  by  sacral  parasympathetic  
nerves  (S2–4)  via  the  pelvic  plexus;  these  fibers  course  through  the 
wall  of  the  colon  as  ascending  intracolonic  fibers  as  far  as,  and  in 
some  instances  including,  the  proximal  colon.  The  chief  excitatory 

neurotransmitters  controlling  motor  function  are  acetylcholine  and 
the  tachykinins,  such  as  substance  P.  The  sympathetic  nerve  supply 
modulates motor functions and reaches the small intestine and colon 
alongside their arterial vessels. Sympathetic input to the gut is gener-
ally excitatory to sphincters and inhibitory to nonsphincteric muscle. 
Visceral afferents convey sensation from the gut to the central nervous 
system (CNS). Some afferent fibers synapse in the prevertebral ganglia 
and reflexly modulate intestinal motility, blood flow, and secretion.
 ■ INTESTINAL FLUID ABSORPTION AND 
SECRETION
On an average day, 9 L of fluid enter the GI tract, ~1 L of residual fluid 
reaches  the  colon,  and  the  stool  excretion  of  fluid  constitutes  about  
0.2 L/d. The colon has a large capacitance and functional reserve and 
may recover up to four times its usual volume of 0.8 L/d, provided the 
rate of flow permits reabsorption to occur. Thus, the colon can partially 
compensate for excess fluid delivery to the colon that may result from 
intestinal absorptive or secretory disorders.

In  the  small  intestine  and  colon,  sodium  absorption  is  predomi-
nantly electrogenic (i.e., it can be measured as an ionic current across 
the membrane because there is not an equivalent loss of a cation from 
the  cell),  and  uptake  takes  place  at  the  apical  membrane;  it  is  com-
pensated for by the export functions of the basolateral sodium pump. 
There  are  several  active  transport  proteins  at  the  apical  membrane, 
especially in the small intestine, whereby sodium ion entry is coupled 
to monosaccharides (e.g., glucose through the transporter SGLT1, or 
fructose  through  GLUT-5).  Glucose  then  exits  the  basal  membrane 
through a specific transport protein, GLUT-2, creating a glucose con-
centration and osmotic gradient between the lumen and the intercel-
lular space, drawing water and electrolytes passively from the lumen. 
Several  channels  mediate  the  secretion  of  chloride  ions  in  diarrheal 
diseases or in response to medications administered for the treatment 
of constipation. The diverse ion channels (chloride channels and cystic 
fibrosis  transmembrane  regulator),  transporters  (SGLT1,  GLUT-2), 
and  receptors  (e.g.,  guanylate  cyclase  C  receptor)  are  summarized  in 
Figure 46-1.

Pubis

Puborectalis

External anal
sphincter

A  variety  of  neural  and  nonneural 
mediators  regulate  colonic  fluid  and 
electrolyte  balance,  including  choliner-
gic, adrenergic, and serotonergic medi-
ators. Angiotensin and aldosterone also 
influence colonic absorption, reflecting 
the common embryologic development 
of the distal colonic epithelium and the 
renal tubules.
 ■ SMALL-INTESTINAL 
MOTILITY
During the fasting period, the motility 
of  the  small  intestine  is  characterized 
by a cyclical event called the migrating 
motor  complex  (MMC),  which  serves 
to clear nondigestible residue from the 
small  intestine  (the  intestinal  “house-
keeper”).  This  organized,  propagated 
series of contractions lasts, on average,  
4  min,  occurs  every  60–90  min,  and 
usually  involves  the  entire  small  intes-
tine. After food ingestion, the small intestine produces irregular, mix-
ing contractions of relatively low amplitude, except in the distal ileum 
where more powerful contractions occur intermittently and empty the 
ileum by bolus transfers.
 ■ ILEOCOLONIC STORAGE AND SALVAGE
The distal ileum acts as a reservoir, emptying intermittently by bolus 
movements. This action allows time for salvage of fluids, electrolytes, 
and nutrients. Segmentation by haustra compartmentalizes the colon 
and  facilitates  mixing,  retention  of  residue,  and  formation  of  solid 
stools.  There  is  increased  appreciation  of  the  intimate  interaction 
between  the  colonic  function  and  the  luminal  ecology.  The  resident 
microorganisms,  predominantly  anaerobic  bacteria,  in  the  colon  are 
necessary for the digestion of unabsorbed carbohydrates that reach the 
colon even in health, thereby providing a vital source of nutrients to 
the mucosa. Normal intestinal flora also keeps pathogens at bay by a 
variety of mechanisms including a crucial role in the development and 
maintenance of a potent but well-regulated immune response capacity 
to pathogens and tolerance to normal ingesta. In health, the ascending 
and transverse regions of colon function as reservoirs (average transit 
time, 15 h), and the descending colon acts as a conduit (average transit 
time,  3  h).  The  colon  is  efficient  at  conserving  sodium  and  water,  a 
function that is particularly important in sodium-depleted patients in 
whom the small intestine alone is unable to maintain sodium balance. 
Diarrhea  or  constipation  may  result  from  alteration  in  the  reservoir 
function  of  the  proximal  colon  or  the  propulsive  function  of  the  left 
colon. Constipation may also result from disturbances of the rectal or 
sigmoid reservoir, typically as a result of dysfunction of the pelvic floor, 
the anal sphincters, the coordination of defecation, or dehydration.
 ■ COLONIC MOTILITY AND TONE
The small-intestinal MMC only rarely continues into the colon. How-
ever, short duration or phasic contractions mix colonic contents, and 
high-amplitude  (>75  mmHg)  propagated  contractions  (HAPCs)  are 
sometimes  associated  with  mass  movements  through  the  colon  and 
normally occur approximately five times per day, usually on awakening 
in the morning and postprandially. Increased frequency of HAPCs may 
result  in  diarrhea  or  urgency.  The  predominant  phasic  contractions 
in  the  colon  are  irregular  and  nonpropagated  and  serve  a  “mixing” 
function.

Colonic tone refers to the background contractility upon which pha-
sic contractile activity (typically contractions lasting <15 s) is superim-
posed.  It  is  an  important  cofactor  in  the  colon’s  capacitance  (volume 
accommodation) and sensation.
 ■ COLONIC MOTILITY AFTER MEAL INGESTION
After meal ingestion, colonic phasic and tonic contractility increase for 
a period of ~2 h. The initial phase (~10 min) is mediated by the vagus

by normal rectal sensation and tonic contraction of the internal anal sphincter and the puborectalis muscle, which wraps 
around the anorectum, maintaining an anorectal angle between 80° and 110°. During defecation, the pelvic floor muscles 
(including the puborectalis) relax, allowing the anorectal angle to straighten by at least 15°, and the perineum descends 
by 1–3.5 cm. The external anal sphincter also relaxes and reduces pressure on the anal canal. (From A Lembo, M Camilleri:

nerve in response to mechanical distention of the stomach. The sub-
sequent response of the colon requires caloric stimulation (e.g., intake 
of at least 500 kcal) and is mediated, at least in part, by hormones (e.g., 
gastrin and serotonin).
 ■ DEFECATION
Tonic  contraction  of  the  puborectalis  muscle,  which  forms  a  sling 
around  the  rectoanal  junction,  is  important  to  maintain  continence; 
during  defecation,  sacral  parasympathetic  nerves  relax  this  muscle, 
facilitating the straightening of the rectoanal angle (Fig. 46-2). Disten-
tion  of  the  rectum  results  in  transient  relaxation  of  the  internal  anal 
sphincter via intrinsic and reflex sympathetic innervation. As sigmoid 
and rectal contractions, as well as straining (Valsalva maneuver), which 
increases  intraabdominal  pressure,  increase  the  pressure  within  the 
rectum, the rectosigmoid angle opens by >15°. Voluntary relaxation of 
the external anal sphincter (striated muscle innervated by the pudendal 
nerve)  in  response  to  the  sensation  produced  by  distention  permits 
the evacuation of feces. Defecation can also be delayed voluntarily by 
contraction of the external anal sphincter.

DIARRHEA
 ■ DEFINITION
Diarrhea is loosely defined as passage of abnormally liquid or unformed 
stools at an increased frequency. For adults on a typical Western diet, 
stool weight >200 g/d can generally be considered diarrheal. Diarrhea 
may be further defined as acute if <2 weeks, persistent if 2–4 weeks, and 
chronic if >4 weeks in duration.

Two  common  conditions,  usually  associated  with  the  passage  of 
stool totaling <200 g/d, must be distinguished from diarrhea, because 
diagnostic  and  therapeutic  algorithms  differ.  Pseudodiarrhea,  or  the 
frequent  passage  of  small  volumes  of  stool,  is  often  associated  with 
rectal  urgency,  tenesmus,  or  a  feeling  of  incomplete  evacuation  and 
accompanies  IBS  or  proctitis.  Fecal  incontinence  is  the  involuntary 
discharge of rectal contents and is most often caused by neuromuscu-
lar disorders or structural anorectal problems. Diarrhea and urgency, 
especially if severe, may aggravate or cause incontinence. Pseudodi-
arrhea  and  fecal  incontinence  occur  at  prevalence  rates  comparable 
to  or  higher  than  that  of  chronic  diarrhea  and  should  always  be 
considered in patients complaining of “diarrhea.” Overflow diarrhea 
may  occur  in  nursing  home  patients  due  to  fecal  impaction  that  is 
readily detectable by rectal examination. A careful history and physi-
cal examination generally allow these conditions to be discriminated 
from true diarrhea.
 ■ ACUTE DIARRHEA
More  than  90%  of  cases  of  acute  diarrhea  are  caused  by  infectious 
agents;  these  cases  are  often  accompanied  by  vomiting,  fever,  and 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   299

abdominal pain. The remaining 10% or so are caused by medications, 
toxic ingestions, ischemia, food indiscretions, and other conditions.

Infectious Agents  Most infectious diarrheas are acquired by fecal-
oral transmission or, more commonly, via ingestion of food or water 
contaminated with pathogens from human or animal feces. In the 
immunocompetent  person,  the  resident  fecal  microflora,  contain-
ing  >500  taxonomically  distinct  species,  are  rarely  the  source  of 
diarrhea and may actually play a role in suppressing the growth of 
ingested  pathogens.  Disturbances  of  flora  by  antibiotics  can  lead 
to  diarrhea  by  reducing  the  digestive  function  or  by  allowing  the 
overgrowth of pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile (Chap. 134). 
Acute  infection  or  injury  occurs  when  the  ingested  agent  over-
whelms  or  bypasses  the  host’s  mucosal  immune  and  nonimmune 
(gastric  acid,  digestive  enzymes,  mucus  secretion,  peristalsis,  and 
suppressive  resident  flora)  defenses.  Established  clinical  associ-
ations  with  specific  enteropathogens  may  offer  diagnostic  clues. 
Diarrhea  occasionally  is  an  early  symptom  of  infection  such  as 
SARS-CoV-2 and Legionella.

In the United States, five high-risk groups are recognized:

1.  Travelers. Nearly 40% of tourists to endemic regions of Latin America, 
Africa,  and  Asia  develop  so-called  traveler’s  diarrhea,  most  com-
monly due to enterotoxigenic or enteroaggregative Escherichia coli 
as well as to Campylobacter, Shigella, Aeromonas, norovirus, Coro-
navirus, and Salmonella. Visitors to Russia (especially St. Petersburg) 
may  have  increased  risk  of Giardia-associated  diarrhea;  visitors  to 
Nepal  may  acquire  Cyclospora.  Campers,  backpackers,  and  swim-
mers in wilderness areas may become infected with Giardia. Cruise 
ships  may  be  affected  by  outbreaks  of  gastroenteritis  caused  by 
agents such as norovirus.

2.  Consumers  of  certain  foods.  Diarrhea  closely  following  food  con-
sumption at a picnic, banquet, or restaurant may suggest infection 
with Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Shigella from chicken; enterohe-
morrhagic E. coli (O157:H7) from undercooked hamburger; Bacillus 
cereus from fried rice or other reheated food; Staphylococcus aureus 
or  Salmonella  from  mayonnaise  or  creams;  Salmonella  from  eggs; 
Listeria from fresh or frozen uncooked foods, mushrooms, or dairy 

products; and Vibrio species, Salmonella, or acute hepatitis A from 
seafood, especially if raw. State departments of public health issue 
communications  regarding  domestic  and  foreign  food-related  ill-
nesses, often identified by rapid DNA typing (PulseNet), that cause 
epidemics  in  the  United  States  (e.g.,  the  Listeria  epidemic  of  2020 
from imported enoki mushrooms).

3.  Immunodeficient  persons.  Individuals  at  risk  for  diarrhea  include 
those with either primary immunodeficiency (e.g., IgA deficiency, 
common variable hypogammaglobulinemia, chronic granulomatous 
disease) or the much more common secondary immunodeficiency 
states  (e.g.,  AIDS,  senescence,  pharmacologic  suppression).  Com-
mon  enteric  pathogens  often  cause  a  more  severe  and  protracted 
diarrheal illness, and, particularly in persons with AIDS, opportu-
nistic infections, such as by Mycobacterium species, certain viruses 
(cytomegalovirus,  adenovirus,  and  herpes  simplex),  and  protozoa 
(Cryptosporidium,  Isospora  belli,  Microsporidia,  and  Blastocystis 
hominis) may also play a role (Chap. 202). In patients with AIDS, 
agents  transmitted  venereally  per  rectum  or  by  extension  from 
vaginal infection (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, 
Chlamydia)  may  contribute  to  proctocolitis.  Symptoms  suggesting 
anorectal  disease,  particularly  pain,  may  result  from  constipation 
occurring coincidentally in a person with immunodeficiency. Per-
sons  with  hemochromatosis  are  especially  prone  to  invasive,  even 
fatal,  enteric  infections  with  Vibrio  species  and  Yersinia  infections 
and should avoid raw fish and exposing open wounds to seawater.
4.  Daycare attendees and their family members. Infections with Shigella, 
Giardia, Cryptosporidium, rotavirus, and other agents are very com-
mon and should be considered.

5.  Institutionalized  persons.  Infectious  diarrhea  is  one  of  the  most 
frequent categories of nosocomial infections in many hospitals and 
long-term care facilities; the causes are a variety of microorganisms 
but most commonly C. difficile. C. difficile can affect those with no 
history of antibiotic use and is often community acquired.

The pathophysiology underlying acute diarrhea by infectious agents 
produces specific clinical features that may also be helpful in diagno-
sis  (Table  46-2).  Profuse,  watery  diarrhea  secondary  to  small-bowel 
hypersecretion  occurs  with  ingestion  of  preformed  bacterial  toxins,

enterotoxin-producing bacteria, and enteroadherent pathogens. Diar-
rhea associated with marked vomiting and minimal or no fever may 
occur  abruptly  within  a  few  hours  after  ingestion  of  the  former  two 
types;  vomiting  is  usually  less,  abdominal  cramping  or  bloating  is 
greater,  and  fever  is  higher  with  the  latter.  Cytotoxin-producing  and 
invasive  microorganisms  all  cause  high  fever  and  abdominal  pain. 
Invasive  bacteria  and  Entamoeba  histolytica  often  cause  bloody  diar-
rhea (referred to as dysentery). Yersinia invades the terminal ileal and 
proximal  colon  mucosa  and  may  cause  especially  severe  abdominal 
pain with tenderness mimicking acute appendicitis.

Finally,  infectious  diarrhea  may  be  associated  with  systemic  man-
ifestations.  Reactive  arthritis  (formerly  known  as  Reiter’s  syndrome), 
arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis may accompany or follow infec-
tions by Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Yersinia. Yersiniosis 
may  also  lead  to  an  autoimmune-type  thyroiditis,  pericarditis,  and 
glomerulonephritis.  Both  enterohemorrhagic  E.  coli  (O157:H7)  and 
Shigella can lead to the hemolytic-uremic syndrome with an attendant 
high mortality rate. The syndrome of postinfectious IBS has now been 
recognized  as  a  complication  of  infectious  diarrhea.  Similarly,  acute 
gastroenteritis may precede the diagnosis of celiac disease or Crohn’s 
disease.  Acute  diarrhea  can  also  be  a  major  symptom  of  several  sys-
temic  infections  including  viral  hepatitis,  listeriosis,  legionellosis,  and 
toxic shock syndrome.

Other Causes  Side effects from medications are probably the most 
common noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea, and etiology may be 
suggested by a temporal association between use and symptom onset. 
Although  innumerable  medications  may  produce  diarrhea,  some  of 
the more frequently incriminated include antibiotics, cardiac antidys-
rhythmics,  antihypertensives,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs),  certain  antidepressants,  chemotherapeutic  agents,  bron-
chodilators,  antacids,  and  laxatives.  Occlusive  or  nonocclusive  ische-
mic colitis typically occurs in persons aged >50 years; often presents 
as acute lower abdominal pain preceding watery, then bloody diarrhea; 
and generally results in acute inflammatory changes in the sigmoid or 
left  colon  while  sparing  the  rectum.  Acute  diarrhea  may  accompany 
colonic  diverticulitis  and  graft-versus-host  disease.  Acute  diarrhea, 
often  associated  with  systemic  compromise,  can  follow  ingestion  of 
toxins  including  organophosphate  insecticides,  amanita  and  other 
mushrooms, arsenic, and preformed toxins in seafood such as ciguat-
era (from algae that the fish eat) and scombroid (an excess of histamine 
due to inadequate refrigeration). Acute anaphylaxis to food ingestion 
can have a similar presentation. Conditions causing chronic diarrhea 
can  also  be  confused  with  acute  diarrhea  early  in  their  course.  This 
confusion may occur with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and some 
of the other inflammatory chronic diarrheas that may have an abrupt 
rather than insidious onset and exhibit features that mimic infection.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Acute Diarrhea

The decision to evaluate acute diarrhea depends on its severity and 
duration  and  on  various  host  factors  (Fig.  46-3).  Most  episodes 
of  acute  diarrhea  are  mild  and  self-limited  and  do  not  justify  the 
cost  and  potential  morbidity  rate  of  diagnostic  or  pharmacologic 
interventions.  Indications  for  evaluation  include  profuse  diarrhea 
with  dehydration,  grossly  bloody  stools,  fever  ≥38.5°C  (≥101°F), 
duration  >48  h  without  improvement,  recent  antibiotic  use,  new 
community outbreaks, associated severe abdominal pain in patients 
aged  >50  years,  and  elderly  (≥70  years)  or  immunocompromised 
patients. In some cases of moderately severe febrile diarrhea associ-
ated with fecal leukocytes (or increased fecal levels of the leukocyte 
proteins,  such  as  calprotectin)  or  with  gross  blood,  a  diagnostic 
evaluation might be avoided in favor of an empirical antibiotic trial 
(see below).

The cornerstone of diagnosis in those suspected of severe acute 
infectious  diarrhea  is  microbiologic  analysis  of  the  stool.  Workup

includes cultures for bacterial and viral pathogens; direct inspection 
for ova and parasites; and immunoassays for certain bacterial tox-
ins  (C.  difficile),  viral  antigens  (rotavirus),  and  protozoal  antigens   
(Giardia, E. histolytica). The aforementioned clinical and epidemi-
ologic associations may assist in focusing the evaluation. If a partic-
ular pathogen or set of possible pathogens is so implicated, either 
the whole panel of routine studies may not be necessary or, in some 
instances, special cultures may be appropriate, as for enterohemor-
rhagic and other types of E. coli, Vibrio species, and Yersinia. Molec-
ular diagnosis of pathogens in stool can be made by identification of 
unique DNA sequences, and evolving microarray technologies have 
led to more rapid, sensitive, specific, and cost-effective diagnosis.

Persistent diarrhea is commonly due to Giardia (Chap. 223), but 
additional  causative  organisms  that  should  be  considered  include 
C. difficile (especially if antibiotics had been administered), E. histo-
lytica, Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter, and others. If stool studies 
are  unrevealing,  flexible  sigmoidoscopy  with  biopsies  and  upper 
endoscopy with duodenal aspirates and biopsies may be indicated. 
Brainerd diarrhea is an increasingly recognized entity characterized 
by  an  abrupt-onset  diarrhea  that  persists  for  at  least  4  weeks,  but 
may last 1–3 years, and is thought to be of infectious origin. It may 
be associated with subtle inflammation of the distal small intestine 
or proximal colon.

Structural  examination  by  sigmoidoscopy,  colonoscopy,  or 
abdominal  computed  tomography  (CT)  scanning  (or  other  imag-
ing approaches) may be appropriate in patients with uncharacter-
ized  persistent  diarrhea  to  exclude  IBD  or  as  an  initial  approach 
in  patients  with  suspected  noninfectious  acute  diarrhea  such  as 
might be caused by ischemic colitis, diverticulitis, or partial bowel 
obstruction.

TREATMENT
Acute Diarrhea

Fluid  and  electrolyte  replacement  are  of  central  importance  to 
all  forms  of  acute  diarrhea.  Fluid  replacement  alone  may  suffice 
for mild cases. Oral sugar-electrolyte solutions (iso-osmolar sport 
drinks  or  designed  formulations)  should  be  instituted  promptly 
with severe diarrhea to limit dehydration, which is the major cause 
of death. Profoundly dehydrated patients, especially infants and the 
elderly, require IV rehydration.

In  moderately  severe  nonfebrile  and  nonbloody  diarrhea, 
antimotility  and  antisecretory  agents  such  as  loperamide  can  be 
useful adjuncts to control symptoms. Such agents should be avoided 
with  febrile  dysentery,  which  may  be  prolonged  by  them,  and 
should  be  used  with  caution  with  drugs  that  increase  levels  due 
to  cardiotoxicity.  Bismuth  subsalicylate  may  reduce  symptoms  of 
vomiting  and  diarrhea  but  should  not  be  used  to  treat  immuno-
compromised patients or those with renal impairment because of 
the risk of bismuth encephalopathy.

Judicious  use  of  antibiotics  is  appropriate  in  selected  instances 
of  acute  diarrhea  and  may  reduce  its  severity  and  duration   
(Fig. 46-3). Many physicians treat moderately to severely ill patients 
with  febrile  dysentery  empirically  without  diagnostic  evaluation 
using  a  quinolone,  such  as  ciprofloxacin  (500  mg  bid  for  3–5  d). 
Empirical treatment can also be considered for suspected giardiasis 
with metronidazole (250 mg qid for 7 d). Selection of antibiotics and 
dosage regimens are otherwise dictated by specific pathogens, geo-
graphic patterns of resistance, and conditions found (Chaps. 133, 
161,  and  165–171).  Because  of  resistance  to  first-line  treatments, 
newer  agents  such  as  nitazoxanide  may  be  required  for  Giardia 
and  Cryptosporidium  infections.  Antibiotic  coverage  is  indicated, 
whether or not a causative organism is discovered, in patients who 
are immunocompromised, have mechanical heart valves or recent 
vascular  grafts,  or  are  elderly.  Bismuth  subsalicylate  may  reduce 
the frequency of traveler’s diarrhea. Antibiotic prophylaxis is only 
indicated  for  certain  patients  traveling  to  high-risk  countries  in 
whom the likelihood or seriousness of acquired diarrhea would be 
especially  high,  including  those  with  immunocompromise,  IBD, 
hemochromatosis,  or  gastric  achlorhydria.  Use  of  ciprofloxacin, 
azithromycin,  or  rifaximin  may  reduce  bacterial  diarrhea  in  such 
travelers by 90%, though rifaximin is not suitable for invasive dis-
ease but rather as treatment for uncomplicated traveler’s diarrhea. 
There is little role for endoscopic evaluation in most circumstances 
except in immunocompromised patients. Finally, physicians should 
be vigilant to identify if an outbreak of diarrheal illness is occurring 
and to alert the public health authorities promptly. This may reduce 
the ultimate size of the affected population.

 ■ CHRONIC DIARRHEA
Diarrhea  lasting  >4  weeks  warrants  evaluation  to  exclude  serious 
underlying pathology. In contrast to acute diarrhea, most of the causes 
of  chronic  diarrhea  are  noninfectious.  The  classification  of  chronic 
diarrhea by pathophysiologic mechanism facilitates a rational approach 
to management, although many diseases cause diarrhea by more than 
one mechanism (Table 46-3).

Secretory Causes  Secretory diarrheas are due to derangements in 
fluid and electrolyte transport across the enterocolonic mucosa. They 
are characterized clinically by watery, large-volume fecal outputs that 
are typically painless and persist with fasting. Because there is no mal-
absorbed solute, stool osmolality is accounted for by normal endoge-
nous electrolytes with no fecal osmotic gap.

MEDICATIONS  Side effects from regular ingestion of drugs and toxins 
are the most common secretory causes of chronic diarrhea. Hundreds 
of prescription and over-the-counter medications (see earlier section, 
“Acute Diarrhea, Other Causes”) may produce diarrhea. Surreptitious 
or  habitual  use  of  stimulant  laxatives  (e.g.,  senna,  cascara,  bisacodyl,

ricinoleic acid [castor oil]) must also be considered. Chronic ethanol 
consumption  may  cause  a  secretory-type  diarrhea  due  to  enterocyte 
injury  with  impaired  sodium  and  water  absorption  as  well  as  rapid 
transit  and  other  alterations.  Inadvertent  ingestion  of  certain  envi-
ronmental toxins (e.g., arsenic) may lead to chronic rather than acute 
forms of diarrhea. Certain bacterial infections may occasionally persist 
and be associated with a secretory-type diarrhea. The oral angiotensin 
receptor blocker olmesartan is associated with diarrhea due to sprue-
like enteropathy.

BOWEL  RESECTION,  MUCOSAL  DISEASE,  OR  ENTEROCOLIC 
FISTULA  These  conditions  may  result  in  a  secretory-type  diarrhea 
because  of  inadequate  surface  for  reabsorption  of  secreted  fluids 
and  electrolytes.  Unlike  other  secretory  diarrheas,  this  subset  of 
conditions  tends  to  worsen  with  eating.  With  disease  (e.g.,  Crohn’s 
ileitis) or resection of <100 cm of terminal ileum, dihydroxy bile acids 
may  escape  absorption  and  stimulate  colonic  secretion  (cholerheic 
diarrhea).  This  mechanism  may  contribute  to  so-called  idiopathic 
secretory diarrhea or bile acid diarrhea (BAD), in which bile acids are 
functionally  malabsorbed  from  a  normal-appearing  terminal  ileum. 
This  idiopathic  bile  acid  malabsorption  (BAM)  may  account  for  an 
average  of  40%  of  unexplained  chronic  diarrhea.  Reduced  negative 
feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis in hepatocytes by fibroblast 
growth  factor  19  (FGF-19)  produced  by  ileal  enterocytes  results  in 
a  degree  of  bile-acid  synthesis  that  exceeds  the  normal  capacity  for 
ileal  reabsorption,  producing  BAD.  An  alternative  cause  of  BAD  is 
a  genetic  variation  in  the  receptor  proteins  (β-klotho  and  fibroblast 
growth factor 4) on the hepatocyte that normally mediate the effect of 
FGF-19. Dysfunction of these proteins prevents FGF-19 inhibition of 
hepatocyte bile acid synthesis. Another mechanism is based on genetic 
variation  in  the  bile  acid  receptor  (TGR5)  in  the  colon,  resulting  in 
accelerated colonic transit.

Partial bowel obstruction, ostomy stricture, or fecal impaction may 
paradoxically lead to increased fecal output due to fluid hypersecretion.

HORMONES  Although uncommon, the classic examples of secretory 
diarrhea  are  those  mediated  by  hormones.  Metastatic  gastrointestinal 
carcinoid tumors or, rarely, primary bronchial carcinoids may produce 
watery diarrhea alone or as part of the carcinoid syndrome that com-
prises  episodic  flushing,  wheezing,  dyspnea,  and  right-sided  valvular 
heart  disease.  Diarrhea  is  due  to  the  release  into  the  circulation  of 
potent  intestinal  secretagogues  including  serotonin,  histamine,  pros-
taglandins,  and  various  kinins.  Pellagra-like  skin  lesions  may  rarely 
occur as the result of serotonin overproduction with niacin depletion. 
Gastrinoma, one of the most common neuroendocrine tumors, most 
typically presents with refractory peptic ulcers, but diarrhea occurs in 
up to one-third of cases and may be the only clinical manifestation in 
10%. While other secretagogues released with gastrin may play a role, 
the diarrhea most often results from fat maldigestion owing to pancre-
atic enzyme inactivation by low intraduodenal pH. The watery diarrhea 
hypokalemia achlorhydria syndrome, also called pancreatic cholera, is 
due to a non-β cell pancreatic adenoma, referred to as a VIPoma, that 
secretes VIP and a host of other peptide hormones including pancre-
atic polypeptide, secretin, gastrin, gastrin-inhibitory polypeptide (also 
called glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide), neurotensin, calcito-
nin, and prostaglandins. The secretory diarrhea is often massive with 
stool volumes >3 L/d; daily volumes as high as 20 L have been reported. 
Life-threatening  dehydration;  neuromuscular  dysfunction  from  asso-
ciated  hypokalemia,  hypomagnesemia,  or  hypercalcemia;  flushing; 
and  hyperglycemia  may  accompany  a  VIPoma.  Medullary  carcinoma 
of the thyroid may present with watery diarrhea caused by calcitonin, 
other  secretory  peptides,  or  prostaglandins.  Prominent  diarrhea  is 
often associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis. Systemic 
mastocytosis,  which  may  be  associated  with  the  skin  lesion  urticaria 
pigmentosa, may cause diarrhea that is either secretory and mediated 
by  histamine  or  inflammatory  due  to  intestinal  infiltration  by  mast 
cells. Large colorectal villous adenomas may rarely be associated with 
a secretory diarrhea that may cause hypokalemia, can be inhibited by 
NSAIDs, and are apparently mediated by prostaglandins.

CONGENITAL DEFECTS IN ION ABSORPTION  Rarely, defects in specific 
carriers  associated  with  ion  absorption  cause  watery  diarrhea  from 
birth. These disorders include defective Cl−/HCO3
− exchange (congen-
ital chloridorrhea) with alkalosis (which results from a mutated DRA 
[down-regulated  in  adenoma]  gene)  and  defective  Na+/H+  exchange 
(congenital  sodium  diarrhea),  which  results  from  a  mutation  in  the 
NHE3 (sodium-hydrogen exchanger) gene and results in acidosis.

Some hormone deficiencies may be associated with watery diarrhea, 
such  as  occurs  with  adrenocortical  insufficiency  (Addison’s  disease) 
that may be accompanied by skin hyperpigmentation.

Osmotic Causes  Osmotic  diarrhea  occurs  when  ingested,  poorly 
absorbable,  osmotically  active  solutes  draw  enough  fluid  into  the 
lumen  to  exceed  the  reabsorptive  capacity  of  the  colon.  Fecal  water 
output increases in proportion to such a solute load. Osmotic diarrhea 
characteristically  ceases  with  fasting  or  with  discontinuation  of  the 
causative agent.

OSMOTIC  LAXATIVES  Ingestion  of  magnesium-containing  antacids, 
health supplements, or laxatives may induce osmotic diarrhea typified 
by  a  stool  osmotic  gap  (>50  mosmol/L):  serum  osmolarity  (typically 
290  mosmol/kg)  −  (2  ×  [fecal  sodium  +  potassium  concentration]). 
Measurement of fecal osmolarity is no longer recommended because, 
even when measured immediately after evacuation, it may be errone-
ous because carbohydrates are metabolized by colonic bacteria, causing 
an increase in osmolarity.

CARBOHYDRATE MALABSORPTION  Carbohydrate malabsorption due 
to acquired or congenital defects in brush-border disaccharidases and 
other  enzymes  leads  to  osmotic  diarrhea  with  a  low  pH.  One  of  the 
most common causes of chronic diarrhea in adults is lactase deficiency, 
which  affects  three-fourths  of  nonwhites  worldwide  and  5–30%  of 
persons  in  the  United  States;  the  total  lactose  load  at  any  one  time 
influences  the  symptoms  experienced.  Most  patients  learn  to  avoid 
milk products without requiring treatment with enzyme supplements. 
Some sugars, such as sorbitol, lactulose, or fructose, are frequently mal-
absorbed, and diarrhea ensues with ingestion of medications, gum, or 
candies sweetened with these poorly or incompletely absorbed sugars.
WHEAT  AND  FODMAP  INTOLERANCE  Chronic  diarrhea,  bloating, 
and abdominal pain are recognized as symptoms of nonceliac gluten 
intolerance  (which  is  associated  with  impaired  intestinal  or  colonic 
barrier  function)  and  intolerance  of  fermentable  oligosaccharides, 
disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). The latter’s 
effects represent the interaction between the GI microbiome and the 
nutrients.

Steatorrheal  Causes  Fat  malabsorption  may  lead  to  greasy, 
foul-smelling, difficult-to-flush diarrhea often associated with weight 
loss  and  nutritional  deficiencies  due  to  concomitant  malabsorption 
of amino acids and vitamins. Increased fecal output is caused by the 
osmotic effects of fatty acids, especially after bacterial hydroxylation, 
and, to a lesser extent, by the neutral fat. Quantitatively, steatorrhea is 
defined as stool fat exceeding the normal 7 g/d; rapid-transit diarrhea 
may result in fecal fat up to 14 g/d; daily fecal fat averages 15–25 g with 
small-intestinal  diseases  and  is  often  >32  g  with  pancreatic  exocrine 
insufficiency.  Intraluminal  maldigestion,  mucosal  malabsorption,  or 
lymphatic obstruction may produce steatorrhea.

INTRALUMINAL  MALDIGESTION  This  condition  most  commonly 
results  from  pancreatic  exocrine  insufficiency,  which  occurs  when 
>90%  of  pancreatic  secretory  function  is  lost.  Chronic  pancreatitis, 
usually  a  sequel  of  ethanol  abuse,  most  frequently  causes  pancreatic 
insufficiency.  Other  causes  include  cystic  fibrosis,  pancreatic  duct 
obstruction, and, rarely, somatostatinoma. Bacterial overgrowth in the 
small intestine may deconjugate bile acids and alter micelle formation, 
impairing fat digestion; it occurs with stasis from a blind-loop, small-
bowel diverticulum or dysmotility and is especially likely in the elderly. 
Finally,  cirrhosis  or  biliary  obstruction  may  lead  to  mild  steatorrhea 
due to deficient intraluminal bile acid concentration.

MUCOSAL  MALABSORPTION  Mucosal  malabsorption  occurs  from 
a  variety  of  enteropathies,  but  it  most  commonly  occurs  from  celiac 
disease. This gluten-sensitive enteropathy affects all ages and is charac-
terized by villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in the proximal small 
bowel  and  can  present  with  fatty  diarrhea  associated  with  multiple 
nutritional  deficiencies  of  varying  severity.  Celiac  disease  is  much 
more  frequent  than  previously  thought;  it  affects  ~1%  of  the  popu-
lation,  frequently  presents  without  steatorrhea,  can  mimic  IBS,  and 
has  many  other  GI  and  extraintestinal  manifestations.  Tropical  sprue 
may produce a similar histologic and clinical syndrome but occurs in 
residents of or travelers to tropical climates; abrupt onset and response 
to antibiotics suggest an infectious etiology.  Whipple’s  disease, due to 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   303

304

the  bacillus  Tropheryma  whipplei  and  histiocytic  infiltration  of  the 
small-bowel mucosa, is a less common cause of steatorrhea that most 
typically  occurs  in  young  or  middle-aged  men;  it  is  frequently  asso-
ciated with arthralgias, fever, lymphadenopathy, and extreme fatigue, 
and  it  may  affect  the  CNS  and  endocardium.  A  similar  clinical  and 
histologic  picture  results  from  Mycobacterium  avium-intracellulare 
infection in patients with AIDS. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare defect 
of  chylomicron  formation  and  fat  malabsorption  in  children,  associ-
ated with acanthocytic erythrocytes, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa. 
Several  other  conditions  may  cause  mucosal  malabsorption  includ-
ing  infections,  especially  with  protozoa  such  as  Giardia,  numerous 
medications  (e.g.,  olmesartan,  mycophenolate  mofetil,  colchicine, 
cholestyramine, neomycin), idiopathic enteropathies, amyloidosis, and 
chronic ischemia.

POSTMUCOSAL  LYMPHATIC  OBSTRUCTION  The  pathophysiology  of 
this condition, which is due to the rare congenital intestinal lymphang-
iectasia  or  to  acquired  lymphatic  obstruction  secondary  to  trauma, 
tumor, cardiac disease, or infection, leads to the unique constellation of 
fat malabsorption with enteric losses of protein (often causing edema) 
and  lymphocytopenia.  Carbohydrate  and  amino  acid  absorption  are 
preserved.

Inflammatory  Causes 
Inflammatory  diarrheas  are  generally 
accompanied  by  pain,  fever,  bleeding,  or  other  manifestations  of 
inflammation. The mechanism of diarrhea may not only be exudation 
but, depending on lesion site, may include fat malabsorption, disrupted 
fluid/electrolyte absorption, and hypersecretion or hypermotility from 
release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. The unifying 
feature  on  stool  analysis  is  the  presence  of  leukocytes  or  leukocyte- 
derived  proteins  such  as  calprotectin.  With  severe  inflammation, 
exudative protein loss can lead to anasarca (generalized edema). Any 
middle-aged  or  older  person  with  chronic  inflammatory-type  diar-
rhea, especially with blood, should be carefully evaluated to exclude a 
colorectal tumor.

IDIOPATHIC  INFLAMMATORY  BOWEL  DISEASE  The  illnesses  in  this 
category, which include Crohn’s disease and chronic ulcerative colitis, are 
among the most common organic causes of chronic diarrhea in adults 
and  range  in  severity  from  mild  to  fulminant  and  life-threatening. 
They may be associated with uveitis, polyarthralgias, cholestatic liver 
disease  (primary  sclerosing  cholangitis),  and  skin  lesions  (erythema 
nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum). Microscopic colitis, including both 
lymphocytic and collagenous colitis, is an increasingly recognized cause 
of  chronic  watery  diarrhea,  especially  in  middle-aged  women  and 
those on NSAIDs, statins, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and selective 
serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs);  biopsy  of  a  normal-appearing 
colon  is  required  for  histologic  diagnosis.  It  may  coexist  with  symp-
toms suggesting IBS or with celiac sprue or drug-induced enteropathy. 
It typically responds well to anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., bismuth), 
the opioid agonist loperamide, or budesonide.

PRIMARY OR SECONDARY FORMS OF IMMUNODEFICIENCY  Immuno-
deficiency  may  lead  to  prolonged  infectious  diarrhea.  With  selective 
IgA deficiency or common variable hypogammaglobulinemia, diarrhea 
is  particularly  prevalent  and  often  the  result  of  giardiasis,  bacterial 
overgrowth, or sprue.

EOSINOPHILIC  GASTROENTERITIS  Eosinophil  infiltration  of  the 
mucosa,  muscularis,  or  serosa  at  any  level  of  the  GI  tract  may  cause 
diarrhea,  pain,  vomiting,  or  ascites.  Affected  patients  often  have  an 
atopic  history,  Charcot-Leyden  crystals  due  to  extruded  eosinophil 
contents may be seen on microscopic inspection of stool, and periph-
eral eosinophilia is present in 50–75% of patients. While hypersensitiv-
ity to certain foods occurs in adults, true food allergy causing chronic 
diarrhea is rare.

OTHER  CAUSES  Chronic  inflammatory  diarrhea  may  be  caused  by 
radiation  enterocolitis,  chronic  graft-versus-host  disease,  autoimmune 

or idiopathic enteropathies, Behçet’s syndrome, and Cronkhite-Canada 
syndrome, among others.

Dysmotility Causes  Rapid transit may accompany many diarrheas 
as a secondary or contributing phenomenon, but primary dysmotility 
is an unusual etiology of true diarrhea. Stool features often suggest a 
secretory  diarrhea,  but  mild  steatorrhea  of  up  to  14  g  of  fat  per  day 
can be produced by maldigestion from rapid transit alone. Hyperthy-
roidism,  carcinoid  syndrome,  and  certain  drugs  (e.g.,  prostaglandins, 
prokinetic agents) may produce hypermotility with resultant diarrhea. 
Primary  visceral  neuromyopathies  or  idiopathic  acquired  intestinal 
pseudoobstruction  may  lead  to  stasis  with  secondary  bacterial  over-
growth  causing  diarrhea.  Diabetic  diarrhea,  often  accompanied  by 
peripheral and generalized autonomic neuropathies, may occur in part 
because of intestinal dysmotility.

The exceedingly common IBS (10% point prevalence, 1–2% per year 
incidence) is characterized by disturbed intestinal and colonic motor 
and sensory responses to various stimuli. Symptoms of stool frequency 
typically  cease  at  night,  alternate  with  periods  of  constipation,  are 
accompanied  by  abdominal  pain  relieved  with  defecation,  and  rarely 
result in weight loss.

Factitial Causes  Factitial diarrhea accounts for up to 15% of unex-
plained diarrheas referred to tertiary care centers. Either as a form of 
Munchausen  syndrome  (deception  or  self-injury  for  secondary  gain) 
or  eating  disorders,  some  patients  covertly  self-administer  laxatives 
alone  or  in  combination  with  other  medications  (e.g.,  diuretics)  or 
surreptitiously  add  water  or  urine  to  stool  sent  for  analysis.  Such 
patients are typically women, often with histories of psychiatric illness, 
and disproportionately from careers in health care. Hypotension and 
hypokalemia  are  common  co-presenting  features.  The  evaluation  of 
such patients may be difficult: contamination of the stool with water 
or urine is suggested by very low or high stool osmolarity, respectively. 
Such  patients  often  deny  this  possibility  when  confronted,  but  they 
do benefit from psychiatric counseling when they acknowledge their 
behavior.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT 
CHRONIC DIARRHEA
The laboratory tools available to evaluate the very common prob-
lem  of  chronic  diarrhea  are  extensive,  and  many  are  costly  and 
invasive.  As  such,  the  diagnostic  evaluation  must  be  rationally 
directed  by  a  careful  history,  including  medications,  and  physical 
examination (Fig. 46-4). When this strategy is unrevealing, simple 
triage tests are often warranted to direct the choice of more com-
plex  investigations  (Fig.  46-4).  The  history,  physical  examination   
(Table  46-4),  and  routine  blood  studies  should  attempt  to  charac-
terize  the  mechanism  of  diarrhea,  identify  diagnostically  helpful 
associations, and assess the patient’s fluid/electrolyte and nutritional 
status.  Patients  should  be  questioned  about  the  onset,  duration, 
pattern, aggravating (especially diet) and relieving factors, and stool 
characteristics  of  their  diarrhea.  The  presence  or  absence  of  fecal 
incontinence, fever, weight loss, pain, certain exposures (travel, med-
ications, contacts with diarrhea), and common extraintestinal mani-
festations (skin changes, arthralgias, oral aphthous ulcers) should be 
noted. A family history of IBD or celiac disease may indicate those 
possibilities.  Physical  findings  may  offer  clues  such  as  a  thyroid 
mass, wheezing, heart murmurs, edema, hepatomegaly, abdominal 
masses,  lymphadenopathy,  mucocutaneous  abnormalities,  peri-
anal  fistulas,  or  anal  sphincter  laxity.  Peripheral  blood  leukocy-
tosis,  elevated  sedimentation  rate,  or  C-reactive  protein  suggests 
inflammation; anemia reflects blood loss or nutritional deficiencies; 
or  eosinophilia  may  occur  with  parasitoses,  neoplasia,  collagen- 
vascular  disease,  allergy,  or  eosinophilic  gastroenteritis.  Blood 
chemistries may demonstrate electrolyte, hepatic, or other metabolic 
disturbances.  Measuring  IgA  tissue  transglutaminase  antibodies

TABLE 46-4  Physical Examination in Patients with Chronic Diarrhea
1.  Are there general features to suggest malabsorption or inflammatory bowel 

disease (IBD) such as anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, edema, or  
clubbing?

2.  Are there features to suggest underlying autonomic neuropathy or collagen-

vascular disease in the pupils, orthostasis, skin, hands, or joints?

3.  Is there an abdominal mass or tenderness?
4.  Are there any abnormalities of rectal mucosa, rectal defects, or altered anal 

sphincter functions?

5.  Are there any mucocutaneous manifestations of systemic disease such as 
dermatitis herpetiformis (celiac disease), erythema nodosum (ulcerative 
colitis), flushing (carcinoid), or oral ulcers for IBD or celiac disease?

may help detect celiac disease. Bile acid diarrhea is confirmed by 
a  scintigraphic  radiolabeled  bile  acid  retention  test;  however,  this 
is  not  available  in  many  countries.  Alternative  approaches  are  a 
screening blood test (serum C4 or FGF-19), measurement of fecal 
bile  acids,  or  a  therapeutic  trial  with  a  bile  acid  sequestrant  (e.g., 
cholestyramine, colestipol or colesevelam).

A  therapeutic  trial  is  often  appropriate,  definitive,  and  highly 
cost-effective when a specific diagnosis is suggested on the initial 
physician encounter. For example, chronic watery diarrhea, which 
ceases with fasting in an otherwise healthy young adult, may justify 
a trial of a lactose-restricted diet; bloating and diarrhea persisting 
since  a  mountain  backpacking  trip  may  warrant  a  trial  of  metro-
nidazole for likely giardiasis; and postprandial diarrhea persisting

following  resection  of  terminal  ileum  might  be  due  to  bile  acid 
malabsorption  and  be  treated  with  cholestyramine,  colestipol,  or 
colesevelam before further evaluation. Persistent symptoms require 
additional investigation.

Certain diagnoses may be suggested on the initial encounter (e.g., 
idiopathic IBD); however, additional focused evaluations may be nec-
essary to confirm the diagnosis and characterize the severity or extent 
of disease so that treatment can be best guided. Patients suspected of 
having IBS should be initially evaluated with flexible sigmoidoscopy 
with colorectal biopsies to exclude IBD, or particularly microscopic 
colitis, which is clinically indistinguishable from IBS with diarrhea or 
functional diarrhea; those with normal findings might be reassured 
and,  as  indicated,  treated  empirically  with  antispasmodics,  antidi-
arrheals, or antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic agents). Any patient who 
presents with chronic diarrhea and hematochezia should be evaluated 
with stool microbiologic studies and colonoscopy.

In an estimated two-thirds of cases, the cause for chronic diar-
rhea remains unclear after the initial encounter, and further testing 
is  required.  Quantitative  stool  collection  and  analyses  can  yield 
important objective data that may establish a diagnosis or charac-
terize the type of diarrhea as a triage for focused additional studies 
(Fig.  46-4).  If  stool  weight  is  >200  g/d,  additional  stool  analyses 
should be performed that might include electrolyte concentration, 
pH, occult blood testing, leukocyte inspection (or leukocyte protein 
assay), fat quantitation, and laxative screens.

For  secretory  diarrheas  (watery,  normal  osmotic  gap),  possible 
medication-related side effects or surreptitious laxative use should 
be  reconsidered.  Microbiologic  studies  should  be  done  including 
fecal  bacterial  cultures  (including  media  for  Aeromonas  and  Ple-
siomonas),  inspection  for  ova  and  parasites,  and  Giardia  antigen 
assay (the most sensitive test for giardiasis). Small-bowel bacterial 
overgrowth  can  be  excluded  by  intestinal  aspirates  with  quanti-
tative  cultures  or  with  glucose  or  lactulose  breath  tests  involving 
measurement  of  breath  hydrogen,  methane,  or  other  metabolite. 
However,  interpretation  of  these  breath  tests  may  be  confounded 
by disturbances of intestinal transit. Upper endoscopy and colonos-
copy  with  biopsies  and  small-bowel  x-rays  (formerly  barium,  but 
increasingly  CT  with  enterography  or  magnetic  resonance  with 
enteroclysis) are helpful to rule out structural or occult inflamma-
tory disease. When suggested by history or other findings, screens 
for peptide hormones should be pursued (e.g., serum gastrin, VIP, 
calcitonin, thyroid hormone/thyroid-stimulating hormone, urinary 
5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, histamine).

Further  evaluation  of  osmotic  diarrhea  should  include  tests  for 
lactose intolerance and magnesium ingestion, the two most common 
causes. Low fecal pH suggests carbohydrate malabsorption; lactose 
malabsorption  can  be  confirmed  by  lactose  breath  testing  or  by  a 
therapeutic trial with lactose exclusion and observation of the effect 
of lactose challenge (e.g., a liter of milk). Lactase determination on 
small-bowel biopsy is not generally available. If fecal magnesium or 
laxative  levels  are  elevated,  inadvertent  or  surreptitious  ingestion 
should be considered and psychiatric help should be sought.

For  those  with  proven  fatty  diarrhea,  endoscopy  with  small-
bowel  biopsy  (including  aspiration  for  quantitative  cultures,  if 
available) should be performed; if this procedure is unrevealing, a 
small-bowel radiograph is often an appropriate next step. If small-
bowel  studies  are  negative  or  if  pancreatic  disease  is  suspected, 
pancreatic  exocrine  insufficiency  should  be  excluded  with  direct 
tests, such as the secretin-cholecystokinin stimulation test or a vari-
ation that could be performed endoscopically. In general, indirect 
tests  such  as  assay  of  fecal  elastase  or  chymotrypsin  activity  or  a 
bentiromide test have fallen out of favor because of low sensitivity 
and specificity.

Chronic  inflammatory-type  diarrheas  should  be  suspected  by 
the presence of blood or leukocytes in the stool. Such findings war-
rant stool cultures; inspection for ova and parasites; C. difficile toxin 
assay;  colonoscopy  with  biopsies;  and,  if  indicated,  small-bowel 
imaging studies.

TREATMENT
Chronic Diarrhea

Treatment  of  chronic  diarrhea  depends  on  the  specific  etiology 
and may be curative, suppressive, or empirical. If the cause can be 
eradicated,  treatment  is  curative  as  with  resection  of  a  colorectal 
cancer,  antibiotic  administration  for  Whipple’s  disease  or  tropical 
sprue, or discontinuation of a drug. For many chronic conditions, 
diarrhea can be controlled by suppression of the underlying mech-
anism. Examples include elimination of dietary lactose for lactase 
deficiency or gluten for celiac sprue, use of glucocorticoids or other 
anti-inflammatory agents for idiopathic IBDs, bile acid sequestrants 
for  bile  acid  malabsorption,  PPIs  for  the  gastric  hypersecretion 
of  gastrinomas,  somatostatin  analogues  such  as  octreotide  for 
malignant  carcinoid  syndrome,  prostaglandin  inhibitors  such  as 
indomethacin  for  medullary  carcinoma  of  the  thyroid,  and  pan-
creatic  enzyme  replacement  for  pancreatic  insufficiency.  When 
the specific cause or mechanism of chronic diarrhea evades diag-
nosis,  empirical  therapy  may  be  beneficial.  Mild  opiates,  such  as 
diphenoxylate or loperamide, are often helpful in mild or moderate 
watery  diarrhea.  For  those  with  more  severe  diarrhea,  codeine 
or  tincture  of  opium  may  be  beneficial.  Such  antimotility  agents 
should be avoided with severe IBD, because toxic megacolon may 
be  precipitated.  Clonidine,  an  α2-adrenergic  agonist,  may  allow 
control of diabetic diarrhea, although the medication may be poorly 
tolerated because it causes postural hypotension. The 5-HT3 recep-
tor antagonists (e.g., alosetron, ondansetron) may relieve diarrhea 
and  urgency  in  patients  with  IBS  diarrhea.  Other  medications 
approved for the treatment of diarrhea associated with IBS are the 
nonabsorbed antibiotic, rifaximin, and the mixed μ-opioid receptor 
(OR)  and  κ-OR  agonist  and  δ-OR  antagonist,  eluxadoline.  The 
latter  may  induce  sphincter  of  Oddi  spasm  and  subsequent  acute 
pancreatitis,  usually  in  patients  with  prior  cholecystectomy.  For 
all  patients  with  chronic  diarrhea,  fluid  and  electrolyte  repletion 
is an important component of management (see “Acute Diarrhea,” 
earlier). Replacement of fat-soluble vitamins may also be necessary 
in patients with chronic steatorrhea.

CONSTIPATION
 ■ DEFINITION
Constipation  is  a  common  complaint  in  clinical  practice  and  usually 
refers  to  persistent,  difficult,  infrequent,  or  seemingly  incomplete 
defecation. Because of the wide range of normal bowel habits, consti-
pation is difficult to define precisely. Most persons have at least three 
bowel  movements  per  week;  however,  low  stool  frequency  alone  is 
not the sole criterion for the diagnosis of constipation. Many consti-
pated patients have a normal frequency of defecation but complain of 
excessive  straining,  hard  stools,  lower  abdominal  fullness,  or  a  sense 
of incomplete evacuation. The individual patient’s symptoms must be 
analyzed in detail to ascertain what is meant by “constipation” or “dif-
ficulty” with defecation.

Stool form and consistency are well correlated with the time elapsed 
from  the  preceding  defecation.  Hard,  pellety  stools  occur  with  slow 
transit, whereas loose, watery stools are associated with rapid transit. 
Both small pellety or very large stools are more difficult to expel than 
normal stools.

The perception of hard stools or excessive straining is more difficult 
to assess objectively, and the need for enemas or digital disimpaction 
is  a  clinically  useful  way  to  corroborate  the  patient’s  perceptions  of 
difficult defecation.

Psychosocial  or  cultural  factors  may  also  be  important.  A  person 
whose  parents  attached  great  importance  to  daily  defecation  will 
become greatly concerned when he or she misses a daily bowel move-
ment; some children withhold stool to gain attention or because of fear 
of pain from anal irritation; and some adults habitually ignore or delay 
the call to have a bowel movement.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases ■ CAUSES
Pathophysiologically, chronic constipation generally results from inad-
equate fiber or fluid intake or from disordered colonic transit or ano-
rectal function. These result from neurogastroenterologic disturbance, 
certain drugs, advancing age, or in association with a large number of 
systemic  diseases  that  affect  the  GI  tract  (Table  46-5).  Constipation 
of recent onset may be a symptom of significant organic disease such 
as  tumor,  anorectal  irritation,  or  stricture.  In  idiopathic  constipation, 
a  subset  of  patients  exhibits  delayed  emptying  of  the  ascending  and 
transverse  colon  with  prolongation  of  transit  (often  in  the  proximal 
colon) and a reduced frequency of propulsive HAPCs. Outlet obstruc-
tion to defecation (also called evacuation disorders) accounts for about 
a quarter of cases presenting with constipation in tertiary care and may 
cause delayed colonic transit, which is usually corrected by biofeedback 
retraining  of  the  disordered  defecation.  Constipation  of  any  cause 
may  be  exacerbated  by  hospitalization  or  chronic  illnesses  that  lead 
to physical or mental impairment and result in inactivity or physical 
immobility.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Constipation

A careful history should explore the patient’s symptoms and con-
firm whether she or he is indeed constipated based on frequency 
(e.g.,  fewer  than  three  bowel  movements  per  week),  consistency 
(lumpy/hard),  excessive  straining,  prolonged  defecation  time,  or 
need to support the perineum or digitate the anorectum to facilitate 
stool evacuation. These latter items identified in the history suggest 
the  presence  of  a  rectal  evacuation  disorder.  In  the  vast  majority 
of cases (probably >90%), there is no underlying cause (e.g., can-
cer, depression, or hypothyroidism), and constipation responds to 
ample  hydration,  exercise,  and  supplementation  of  dietary  fiber 
(15–25 g/d). A good diet and medication history and attention to 
psychosocial issues are key. Physical examination and, particularly, 
rectal examination are mandatory and should exclude fecal impac-
tion  and  most  of  the  important  diseases  that  present  with  con-
stipation  and  possibly  indicate  features  suggesting  an  evacuation 
disorder (e.g., high anal sphincter tone, failure of perineal descent, 
or paradoxical puborectalis contraction or puborectalis tenderness 
during straining to simulate stool evacuation).

The  presence  of  weight  loss,  rectal  bleeding,  or  anemia 
with  constipation  mandates  either  flexible  sigmoidoscopy  plus

barium enema or colonoscopy alone, particularly in patients aged  
>40 years, to exclude structural diseases such as cancer or strictures. 
Colonoscopy  alone  is  most  cost-effective  in  this  setting  because 
it  provides  an  opportunity  to  biopsy  mucosal  lesions,  perform 
polypectomy,  or  dilate  strictures.  Barium  enema  has  advantages 
over colonoscopy in the patient with isolated constipation because 
it  is  less  costly  and  identifies  colonic  dilation  and  all  significant 
mucosal lesions or strictures that are likely to present with constipa-
tion. Melanosis coli, or pigmentation of the colon mucosa, indicates 
the use of anthraquinone laxatives such as cascara or senna; how-
ever, this is usually apparent from a careful history. An unexpected 
disorder such as megacolon or cathartic colon may also be detected 
by colonic radiographs. Measurement of serum calcium, potassium, 
and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels will identify rare patients 
with metabolic disorders.

Patients  with  more  troublesome  constipation  may  not  respond 
to  fiber  alone  and  may  be  helped  by  a  bowel-training  regimen, 
which  involves  taking  an  osmotic  laxative  (e.g.,  magnesium  salts, 
lactulose, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol) and evacuating with enema 
or suppository (e.g., glycerin or bisacodyl) as needed. After break-
fast,  a  distraction-free  15–20  min  on  the  toilet  without  straining 
is  encouraged.  Excessive  straining  may  lead  to  development  of 
hemorrhoids and, if there is weakness of the pelvic floor or injury 
to  the  pudendal  nerve,  may  result  in  obstructed  defecation  from 
descending  perineum  syndrome  several  years  later.  Those  few 
who do not benefit from the simple measures delineated above or 
require  long-term treatment  or fail to respond to potent laxatives 
should undergo further investigation (Fig. 46-5). Novel agents that 
induce  secretion  (e.g.,  lubiprostone,  a  chloride  channel  activator, 
or linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist that activates chloride 
secretion) are also available.

 ■ INVESTIGATION OF SEVERE CONSTIPATION
A small minority (probably <5%) of patients have severe or “intracta-
ble” constipation; about 25% have evacuation disorders. These are the 
patients most likely to require evaluation by gastroenterologists or in 
referral  centers.  Further  observation  of  the  patient  may  occasionally

reveal a previously unrecognized cause, such as an evacuation disor-
der,  laxative  abuse,  malingering,  or  psychological  disorder.  In  these 
patients, evaluations of the physiologic function of the colon and pelvic 
floor and of psychological status aid in the rational choice of treatment. 
Even  among  these  highly  selected  patients  with  severe  constipation, 
a  cause  can  be  identified  in  only  about  one-third  of  tertiary  referral 
patients, with the others being diagnosed with normal transit consti-
pation. Since evacuation disorders also retard colonic transit through 
the  left  colon  or  the  entire  colon,  anorectal  and  pelvic  floor  testing 
should precede transit measurements if there is clinical suspicion of an 
evacuation disorder. If an evacuation disorder is identified on testing, 
colonic transit may be unnecessary.
Measurement  of  Colonic  Transit  Radiopaque  marker  transit 
tests  are  easy,  repeatable,  generally  safe,  inexpensive,  reliable,  and 
highly applicable in evaluating constipated patients in clinical practice. 
Several  validated  methods  are  very  simple.  For  example,  radiopaque 
markers are ingested; an abdominal flat film taken 5 days later should 
indicate passage of 80% of the markers out of the colon without the use 
of laxatives or enemas. This test does not provide useful information 
about the transit profile of the stomach and small bowel. An alternative 
approach involves ingestion of 24 radiopaque markers on 3 successive 
days  and  an  abdominal  radiograph  on  the  fourth  day.  The  number 
of  markers  counted  in  the  radiograph  is  an  estimate  of  the  colonic 
transit in hours. The collection of gas in the rectum between the level 
of the ischial spines and the lower border of the sacroiliac joints may 
suggest  the  presence  of  a  rectal  evacuation  disorder  as  the  cause  of 
constipation.

Radioscintigraphy  with  a  delayed-release  capsule  containing  radi-
olabeled particles has been used to noninvasively characterize normal, 
accelerated, or delayed colonic function over 24–48 h with low radi-
ation  exposure.  This  approach  simultaneously  assesses  gastric,  small 
bowel  (which  may  be  important  in  ~20%  of  patients  with  delayed 
colonic  transit  because  they  reflect  a  more  generalized  GI  motility 
disorder),  and  colonic  transit.  The  disadvantages  are  the  greater  cost 
and  the  need  for  specific  materials  prepared  in  a  nuclear  medicine 
laboratory.
Anorectal  and  Pelvic  Floor  Tests  Pelvic  floor  dysfunction  is 
suggested by the inability to evacuate the rectum, a feeling of persistent 
rectal fullness, rectal pain, the need to extract stool from the rectum 
digitally,  application  of  pressure  on  the  posterior  wall  of  the  vagina, 
support  of  the  perineum  during  straining,  and  excessive  straining. 
These significant symptoms should be contrasted with the simple sense 
of incomplete rectal evacuation, which is common in IBS.

Formal psychological evaluation may identify eating disorders, “control 
issues,” depression, or posttraumatic stress disorders that may respond to 
cognitive or other intervention and may be important in restoring quality 
of life to patients who might present with chronic constipation.

A  simple  clinical  test  in  the  office  to  document  a  nonrelaxing 
puborectalis  muscle  is  to  have  the  patient  strain  to  expel  the  index 
finger during a digital rectal examination. Motion of the puborectalis 
posteriorly during straining indicates proper coordination of the pelvic 
floor muscles. Motion anteriorly with paradoxical contraction or lim-
ited perineal descent (<1.5 cm) during simulated evacuation indicates 
pelvic floor dysfunction.

Measurement of perineal descent is relatively easy to gauge clinically 
by placing the patient in the left decubitus position and watching the 
perineum to detect inadequate descent (<1.5 cm, a sign of pelvic floor 
dysfunction) or perineal ballooning during straining relative to bony 
landmarks (>4 cm, suggesting excessive perineal descent).

A useful overall test of evacuation is the balloon expulsion test. A 
balloon-tipped urinary catheter is placed and inflated with 50 mL of 
water. Normally, a patient can expel it while seated on a toilet or in the 
left lateral decubitus position. In the lateral position, the weight needed 
to facilitate expulsion of the balloon is determined; normally, expulsion 
occurs with <200 g added or unaided within 1 minute.

Anorectal  manometry,  when  used  in  the  evaluation  of  patients 
with  severe  constipation,  may  find  an  excessively  high  resting  
(>80 mmHg) or squeeze anal sphincter tone, suggesting anismus (anal 

sphincter spasm). This test also identifies rare syndromes, such as adult 
Hirschsprung’s disease, by the absence of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex.
Defecography  (a  dynamic  barium  enema  including  lateral  views 
obtained  during  barium  expulsion  or  a  magnetic  resonance  defeco-
gram) reveals “soft abnormalities” in many patients; the most relevant 
findings are the measured changes in rectoanal angle, anatomic defects 
of  the  rectum  such  as  internal  mucosal  prolapse,  and  enteroceles  or 
rectoceles.  Surgically  remediable  conditions  are  identified  in  only  a 
few  patients.  These  include  severe,  whole-thickness  intussusception 
with complete outlet obstruction due to funnel-shaped plugging at the 
anal canal or an extremely large rectocele that fills preferentially during 
attempts at defecation instead of expulsion of the barium through the 
anus.  In  summary,  defecography  requires  an  interested  and  experi-
enced radiologist, and abnormalities are not pathognomonic for pelvic 
floor  dysfunction.  The  most  common  cause  of  outlet  obstruction  is 
failure  of  the  puborectalis  muscle  to  relax;  this  is  not  identified  by 
barium defecography but can be demonstrated by magnetic resonance 
defecography,  which  provides  more  information  about  the  structure 
and function of the pelvic floor, distal colorectum, and anal sphincters.
Neurologic testing (electromyography) is more helpful in the eval-
uation  of  patients  with  incontinence  than  of  those  with  symptoms 
suggesting obstructed defecation. The absence of neurologic signs in 
the  lower  extremities  suggests  that  any  documented  denervation  of 
the  puborectalis  results  from  pelvic  (e.g.,  obstetric)  injury  or  from 
stretching of the pudendal nerve by chronic, long-standing straining. 
Constipation  is  common  among  patients  with  spinal  cord  injuries, 
neurologic diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and 
diabetic neuropathy.

Spinal-evoked  responses  during  electrical  rectal  stimulation  or 
stimulation  of  external  anal  sphincter  contraction  by  applying  mag-
netic  stimulation  over  the  lumbosacral  cord  identify  patients  with 
limited sacral neuropathies with sufficient residual nerve conduction 
to attempt biofeedback training.

In  summary,  a  balloon  expulsion  test  is  an  important  screening 
test  for  anorectal  dysfunction.  Rarely,  an  anatomic  evaluation  of  the 
rectum or anal sphincters and an assessment of pelvic floor relaxation 
are the tools for evaluating patients in whom obstructed defecation is 
suspected and is associated with symptoms of rectal mucosal prolapse, 
pressure  of  the  posterior  wall  of  the  vagina  to  facilitate  defecation 
(suggestive of anterior rectocele), or prior pelvic surgery that may be 
complicated by enterocele.

TREATMENT
Constipation

After the cause of constipation is characterized, a treatment deci-
sion  can  be  made.  Slow-transit  constipation  requires  aggressive 
medical or surgical treatment; anismus or pelvic floor dysfunction 
usually  responds  to  biofeedback  management  (Fig.  46-5).  The 
remaining ~60% of patients with constipation have normal colonic 
transit and can be treated symptomatically. Patients with spinal cord 
injuries  or  other  neurologic  disorders  require  a  dedicated  bowel 
regimen that often includes rectal stimulation, enema therapy, and 
carefully timed laxative therapy.

Patients with constipation are treated with bulk (fiber, psyllium), 
osmotic  (milk  of  magnesia,  lactulose,  polyethylene  glycol),  secre-
tory (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide, tenapanor), and prok-
inetic or stimulant laxatives (including diphenyl methanes such as 
bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate and 5-HT4 agonists prucalopride 
and tegaserod). If a 3- to 6-month trial of medical therapies fails, 
unassociated  with  obstructed  defecation,  the  patient  should  be 
considered  for  laparoscopic  colectomy  with  ileorectostomy;  how-
ever, this should not be undertaken for pain or if there is continued 
evidence of an evacuation disorder or a generalized GI dysmotility. 
Referral  to  a  specialized  center  for  further  tests  of  colonic  motor 
function is warranted. The decision to resort to surgery is facilitated 
by the presence of megacolon and megarectum. The complications 
after  surgery  include  small-bowel  obstruction  (11%)  and  fecal

quency of defecation is 3–8 per day during the first year, dropping 
to 1–3 per day from the second year after surgery.

Patients who have a combined (evacuation and transit/motility) 
disorder should first pursue pelvic floor retraining (biofeedback and 
muscle relaxation), psychological counseling, and dietetic advice. If 
symptoms are intractable despite biofeedback and optimized med-
ical therapy, colectomy and ileorectostomy could be considered as 
long as the evacuation disorder is resolved and optimized medical 
therapy  is  unsuccessful.  In  patients  with  pelvic  floor  dysfunction 
alone,  biofeedback  training  has  a  70–80%  success  rate,  measured 
by the acquisition of comfortable stool habits. Attempts to manage 
pelvic  floor  dysfunction  with  operations  (internal  anal  sphincter 
or  puborectalis  muscle  division)  or  injections  with  botulinum 
toxin  have  achieved  only  mediocre  success  and  have  been  largely 
abandoned.

47 Unintentional Weight  

Loss
J. Larry Jameson

Involuntary or unintentional weight loss (UWL) is frequently insidious 
and can have important implications, often serving as a harbinger of 
serious underlying disease. Clinically important weight loss is defined 
as the loss of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or >5% of one’s body weight over a 
period of 6–12 months. UWL is encountered in up to 8% of all adult 
outpatients  and  27%  of  frail  persons  aged  ≥65  years.  There  is  no 
identifiable  cause  in  up  to  one-quarter  of  patients  despite  extensive 
investigation. Conversely, up to half of people who claim to have lost 
weight  have  no  documented  evidence  of  weight  loss.  People  with  no 
known cause of weight loss generally have a better prognosis than do

those  with  known  causes,  particularly  when  the  source  is  neoplastic. 
Weight loss in older persons is associated with a variety of deleterious 
effects, including falls and fractures, pressure ulcers, impaired immune 
function, and decreased functional status. Not surprisingly, significant 
weight  loss  is  associated  with  increased  mortality,  which  can  range 
from 9% to as high as 38% within 1–2.5 years in the absence of clinical 
awareness and attention.
 ■ PHYSIOLOGY OF WEIGHT REGULATION WITH 
AGING
(See also Chaps. 401 and 476) Among healthy aging people, total body 
weight  peaks  in  the  sixth  decade  of  life  and  generally  remains  stable 
until the ninth decade, after which it gradually falls. In contrast, lean 
body mass (fat-free mass) begins to decline at a rate of 0.3 kg per year 
in the third decade, and the rate of decline increases further beginning 
at  age  60  in  men  and  age  65  in  women.  These  changes  in  lean  body 
mass  largely  reflect  the  age-dependent  decline  in  growth  hormone 
secretion  and,  consequently,  circulating  levels  of  insulin-like  growth 
factor type I (IGF-I) that occur with normal aging. Loss of sex steroids, 
at  menopause  in  women  and  more  gradually  in  men,  also  contrib-
utes to these changes in body composition. In the healthy elderly, an 
increase in fat tissue balances the loss in lean body mass until very old 
age, when loss of both fat and skeletal muscle occurs. Age-dependent 
changes also occur at the cellular level. Telomeres shorten, and body 
cell mass—the fat-free portion of cells—declines steadily with aging.

Between  ages  20  and  80,  mean  energy  intake  is  reduced  by  up  to 
1200 kcal/d in men and 800 kcal/d in women. Decreased hunger is a 
reflection of reduced physical activity and loss of lean body mass, pro-
ducing lower demand for calories and food intake. Several important 
age-associated physiologic changes also predispose elderly persons to 
weight loss, such as declining chemosensory function (smell and taste), 
reduced efficiency of chewing, slowed gastric emptying, and alterations 
in the neuroendocrine axis, including changes in levels of leptin, chole-
cystokinin, neuropeptide Y, and other hormones and peptides. These 
changes are associated with early satiety and a decline in both appetite 
and the hedonistic appreciation of food. Collectively, they contribute to 
the “anorexia of aging.” As noted below, these physiologic changes with 
aging may be accompanied by social isolation, poverty, and immobility, 
further contributing to undernutrition.

 ■ CAUSES OF UNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS
Most causes of UWL belong to one of four categories: (1) malignant 
neoplasms, (2) chronic inflammatory or infectious diseases, (3) meta-
bolic disorders (e.g., hyperthyroidism and diabetes), or (4) psychiatric 
disorders (Table 47-1). Not infrequently, more than one of these causes 
can  be  responsible  for  UWL.  Depending  upon  patient  populations, 
UWL  is  caused  by  malignant  disease  in  a  quarter  of  patients  and  by 
organic  disease  in  one-third,  with  the  remainder  due  to  psychiatric 
disease, medications, or uncertain causes. Risk factors for undiagnosed 
cancer  include  a  history  of  smoking,  particularly  for  men,  localizing 
symptoms, and abnormal laboratory tests.

The most common malignant causes of UWL are gastrointestinal, 
hepatobiliary,  hematologic,  lung,  breast,  genitourinary,  ovarian,  and 
prostate. Half of all patients with cancer lose some body weight; one-
third lose more than 5% of their original body weight, and up to 20% of 
all cancer deaths are caused directly by cachexia (through immobility 
and/or  cardiac/respiratory  failure).  The  greatest  incidence  of  weight 
loss is seen among patients with solid tumors. Malignancy that reveals 
itself through significant weight loss usually has a very poor prognosis.
In addition to malignancies, gastrointestinal diseases are among the 
most  prominent  causes  of  UWL.  Peptic  ulcer  disease,  inflammatory 
bowel  disease,  dysmotility  syndromes,  chronic  pancreatitis,  celiac 
disease,  constipation,  and  atrophic  gastritis  are  some  of  the  more 
common entities. Oral and dental problems are easily overlooked and 
may manifest with halitosis, poor oral hygiene, xerostomia, inability to 
chew,  reduced  masticatory  force,  nonocclusion,  temporomandibular 
joint syndrome, edentulousness, and pain due to caries or abscesses.

Tuberculosis, fungal diseases, parasites, subacute bacterial endocar-
ditis,  and  HIV  are  well-documented  causes  of  UWL.  Cardiovascular

and  pulmonary  diseases  cause  UWL  through  increased  metabolic 
demand and decreased appetite and caloric intake. Repeated surgeries 
may lead to weight loss because of reduced caloric intake and increased 
metabolic demands resulting from a systemic inflammatory response. 
Uremia  produces  nausea,  anorexia,  and  vomiting.  Connective  tissue 
diseases may increase metabolic demand and disrupt nutritional bal-
ance.  As  the  incidence  of  diabetes  mellitus  increases  with  aging,  the 
associated glucosuria can contribute to weight loss. Hyperthyroidism 
in the elderly may have less prominent sympathomimetic features and 
may present as “apathetic hyperthyroidism” or T3 toxicosis (Chap. 382).
Neurologic injuries such as stroke, quadriplegia, and multiple scle-
rosis may lead to visceral and autonomic dysfunction that can impair 
caloric intake. Dysphagia from these neurologic insults is a common 
mechanism. Functional disability that compromises activities of daily 
living  (ADLs)  is  a  common  cause  of  undernutrition  in  the  elderly. 
Visual impairment from ophthalmic or central nervous system disor-
ders such as a tremor can limit the ability of people to prepare and eat 
meals. UWL may be one of the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer’s 
dementia.

Isolation  and  depression  are  significant  causes  of  UWL  that  may 
manifest as an inability to care for oneself, including nutritional needs. 
A  cytokine-mediated  inflammatory  metabolic  cascade  can  be  both 
a  cause  of  and  a  manifestation  of  depression.  Bereavement  can  be  a 
cause of UWL and, when present, is often more pronounced in men. 
More intense forms of mental illness such as paranoid disorders may 

lead to delusions about food and cause weight loss. Alcoholism can be 
a significant source of weight loss and malnutrition.

Elderly  persons  living  in  poverty  may  have  to  choose  whether  to 
purchase food or use the money for other expenses, including medica-
tions. Screening questions can probe whether patients have run out of 
food or whether they routinely purchase less than they need. Institu-
tionalization is an independent risk factor, as up to 30–50% of nursing 
home patients have inadequate food intake.

Medications can cause anorexia, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal 
distress, diarrhea, dry mouth, and changes in taste. This is particularly 
an issue in the elderly, many of whom take five or more medications.
 ■ ASSESSMENT
The four major manifestations of UWL are (1) anorexia (loss of appe-
tite),  (2)  sarcopenia  (loss  of  muscle  mass),  (3)  cachexia  (a  syndrome 
that combines weight loss, loss of muscle and adipose tissue, anorexia, 
and  weakness),  and  (4)  dehydration.  The  current  obesity  epidemic 
adds complexity, as excess adipose tissue can mask the development of 
sarcopenia and delay awareness of the development of cachexia. If it is 
not possible to measure weight directly, a change in clothing size, cor-
roboration of weight loss by a relative or friend, and a numeric estimate 
of weight loss provided by the patient are suggestive of true weight loss.
Initial  assessment  includes  a  comprehensive  history  and  physical,  a 
complete  blood  count,  tests  of  liver  enzyme  levels,  C-reactive  protein, 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, renal function studies, thyroid function 
tests, chest radiography, and an abdominal ultrasound (Table 47-2). Age-, 
sex-, and risk factor–specific cancer screening tests, such as mammogra-
phy and colonoscopy, should be performed (Chap. 70). Patients at risk 
should have HIV testing. All elderly patients with weight loss should 
undergo screening for dementia and depression by using instruments 
such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Geriatric Depres-
sion Scale, respectively (Chap. 477). The Mini Nutritional Assessment 
(www.mna-elderly.com) and the Nutrition Screening Initiative (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1694757/)  are  also  available 
for  the  nutritional  assessment  of  elderly  patients.  Almost  all  patients 
with a malignancy and >90% of those with other organic diseases have 
at  least  one  laboratory  abnormality.  In  patients  presenting  with  sub-
stantial UWL, major organic and malignant diseases are unlikely when

a  baseline  evaluation  is  completely  normal.  Careful  follow-up  rather 
than undirected testing is advised because the prognosis of weight loss 
of undetermined cause is generally favorable.

TREATMENT
Unintentional Weight Loss

The first priority in managing weight loss is to identify and treat the 
underlying causes. Treatment of underlying metabolic, psychiatric, 
infectious, or other systemic disorders may be sufficient to restore 
weight  and  functional  status  gradually.  Medications  that  cause 
nausea  or  anorexia  should  be  withdrawn  or  changed,  if  possible. 
For  those  with  unexplained  UWL,  oral  nutritional  supplements 
such as high-energy drinks sometimes reverse weight loss. Advis-
ing  patients  to  consume  supplements  between  meals  rather  than 
with a meal may help minimize appetite suppression and facilitate 
increased  overall  intake.  Orexigenic,  anabolic,  and  anticytokine 
agents are under investigation. In selected patients, the antidepres-
sant  mirtazapine  results  in  a  significant  increase  in  body  weight, 
body fat mass, and leptin concentration. Patients with wasting con-
ditions who can comply with an appropriate exercise program gain 
muscle  protein  mass,  strength,  and  endurance  and  may  be  more 
capable of performing ADLs.

48 Gastrointestinal Bleeding

Loren Laine

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) presents as either overt or occult bleed-
ing. Overt GIB is manifested by hematemesis, vomitus of red blood or 
“coffee-grounds” material; melena, black, tarry stool; and/or hematoc-
hezia, passage of red or maroon blood from the rectum. In the absence 
of overt bleeding, occult GIB may present with symptoms of blood loss 
or anemia such as lightheadedness, syncope, angina, or dyspnea; with 
iron-deficiency anemia; or a positive fecal occult blood test on colorec-
tal cancer screening. GIB is also categorized by the site of bleeding as 
upper,  from  the  esophagus,  stomach,  or  duodenum;  lower,  from  the 
colon; small intestinal; or obscure GIB if the source is unclear.

GIB is the most common gastrointestinal condition leading to hos-
pitalization in the United States, accounting for ~513,000 admissions 
and  $5  billion  in  direct  costs  annually.  The  case  fatality  of  patients 
hospitalized with GIB is ~2% in the United States. Patients generally 
die  from  decompensation  of  other  underlying  illnesses  rather  than 
exsanguination.

 ■ SOURCES OF GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING
Upper  Gastrointestinal  Sources  of  Bleeding  •  PEPTIC 
ULCERS  Peptic  ulcers  are  the  most  common  cause  of  upper  GIB 
(UGIB),  accounting  for  ~50%  of  UGIB  hospitalizations.  Features  of 
an ulcer at endoscopy provide important prognostic information that 
guides subsequent management decisions (Fig. 48-1). Approximately 
20%  of  patients  with  bleeding  ulcers  have  the  highest-risk  findings 
of  active  bleeding  or  a  nonbleeding  visible  vessel;  one-third  of  such 
patients have further bleeding that requires urgent surgery if they are 
treated conservatively. These patients benefit from endoscopic therapy 
such as bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, injection therapy (e.g., 
absolute alcohol, 1:10,000 epinephrine), and/or clips with reductions in 
bleeding, hospital stay, mortality, and costs. In contrast, patients with 
clean-based ulcers have rates of serious recurrent bleeding approaching 
zero.  If  stable  with  no  other  reason  for  hospitalization,  such  patients 
may be discharged home after endoscopy.

Randomized  controlled  trials  document  that  high-dose,  constant- 
infusion  IV  proton  pump  inhibitor  (PPI)  (80-mg  bolus  and  8-mg/h 
infusion),  designed  to  sustain  intragastric  pH  >6  and  enhance  clot 
stability,  decreases  further  bleeding  and  mortality  in  patients  with 
high-risk ulcers (active bleeding, nonbleeding visible vessel, adherent 
clot) when given after endoscopic therapy. Meta-analysis of random-
ized trials indicates that high-dose intermittent PPIs are noninferior to  
constant-infusion  PPI  therapy  and  thus  may  be  substituted.  Patients 
with  lower-risk  findings  (flat  pigmented  spot  or  clean  base)  do  not 
require endoscopic therapy and receive standard doses of oral PPI.

Approximately  10–50%  of  patients  with  bleeding  ulcers  rebleed 
within  the  next  year  if  no  preventive  strategies  are  employed.  Pre-
vention  of  recurrent  bleeding  focuses  on  the  three  main  factors  in 
ulcer pathogenesis, Helicobacter pylori, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs  (NSAIDs),  and  acid.  Eradication  of  H.  pylori  in  patients  with 
bleeding ulcers decreases rebleeding rates to <5%. If a bleeding ulcer 
develops in a patient taking NSAIDs, the NSAIDs should be discon-
tinued. If NSAIDs must be given, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective 
NSAID plus a PPI is recommended, based on results of a randomized 
trial.  Patients  with  established  cardiovascular  disease  who  develop 
bleeding ulcers while taking low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention 
should restart aspirin as soon as possible after their bleeding episode 
(1–7  days).  A  randomized  trial  showed  that  immediate  reinstitution 
of aspirin was associated with a lower 8-week mortality compared to 
not restarting aspirin (1% vs 13%; hazard ratio, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.6). 
In contrast, aspirin probably should be discontinued in most patients 
taking  aspirin  for  primary  prevention  of  cardiovascular  events  who 
develop UGIB. Patients with bleeding ulcers unrelated to H. pylori or 
NSAIDs should remain on PPI therapy indefinitely given a 42% inci-
dence of rebleeding at 7 years without protective therapy. Peptic ulcers 
are discussed in Chap. 324.

MALLORY-WEISS  TEARS  Mallory-Weiss  tears  account  for  ~2–10%  of 
UGIB  hospitalizations.  The  classic  history  is  vomiting,  retching,  or 
coughing  preceding  hematemesis,  especially  in  an  alcoholic  patient. 
Bleeding from these tears, which are usually on the gastric side of the 
gastroesophageal junction, stops spontaneously in ~80–90% of patients 
and recurs in only 0–10%. Endoscopic therapy is indicated for actively 
bleeding  Mallory-Weiss  tears.  Mallory-Weiss  tears  are  discussed  in 
Chap. 323.

ESOPHAGEAL  VARICES  The  proportion  of  UGIB  hospitalizations 
due  to  varices  varies  widely,  from  ~2–40%,  depending  on  the  popu-
lation. Patients with variceal hemorrhage have poorer outcomes than 
patients  with  other  sources  of  UGIB.  Esophageal  varices  are  treated 
with endoscopic ligation and an IV vasoactive medication (octreotide, 
somatostatin,  vapreotide,  terlipressin)  for  2–5  days.  Combination  of 
endoscopic and medical therapy is superior to either therapy alone in 
decreasing rebleeding. Over the long term, treatment with nonselective 
beta  blockers  plus  endoscopic  ligation  is  recommended  because  the 
combination is more effective than either alone in reduction of recur-
rent esophageal variceal bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portosys-
temic shunt (TIPS) is recommended in patients who have persistent or

recurrent bleeding despite endoscopic and medical therapy. TIPS also 
should be considered in the first 1–2 days of hospitalization for acute 
variceal bleeding in patients with advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh 
class  B,  Child-Pugh  class  C  with  score  10–13),  because  randomized 
trials show significant decreases in rebleeding and mortality compared 
with standard endoscopic and medical therapy.

Portal  hypertension  is  also  responsible  for  bleeding  from  gastric 
varices, varices in the small and large intestine, and portal hypertensive 
gastropathy  and  enterocolopathy.  Bleeding  gastric  varices  are  treated 
with endoscopic injection of tissue adhesive (e.g., n-butyl cyanoacry-
late), if available; if not, TIPS is performed.

EROSIVE DISEASE  Erosions are endoscopically visualized breaks that 
are confined to the mucosa and do not cause major bleeding because 
arteries and veins are not present in the mucosa. Erosions in the esoph-
agus, stomach, or duodenum commonly cause mild UGIB, with erosive 
gastritis and duodenitis accounting for perhaps ~10–15% and erosive 
esophagitis (primarily due to gastroesophageal reflux disease) account-
ing for ~1–10% of UGIB hospitalizations. The most important cause 
of gastric and duodenal erosions is NSAID use: ~50% of patients who 
chronically ingest NSAIDs may have gastric erosions. Other potential 
causes  of  gastric  erosions  include  alcohol  intake,  H.  pylori  infection, 
and stress-related mucosal injury.

Stress-related gastric mucosal injury occurs only in extremely sick 
patients, such as those with serious trauma, major surgery, burns cov-
ering more than one-third of the body surface area, major intracranial 
disease, or severe medical illness (e.g., ventilator dependence, coagul-
opathy). Severe bleeding should not develop unless ulceration occurs. 
The  mortality  rate  in  these  patients  is  high  because  of  their  serious 
underlying illnesses.

The incidence of bleeding from stress-related gastric mucosal injury 
has  decreased  dramatically  in  recent  years,  most  likely  due  to  better 
care of critically ill patients. A recent double-blind placebo-controlled 
randomized  trial  in  3282  intensive  care  patients  with  risk  factors  for 
GIB  showed  a  small  benefit  of  PPI  in  clinically  important  bleeding 
(2.5%  vs  4.2%)  without  a  difference  in  mortality  or  infections  (e.g., 

Clostridium  difficile,  pneumonia).  Thus,  pharmacologic  prophylaxis 
for bleeding has limited benefit but may be considered in the high-risk 
patients mentioned above. Meta-analyses of randomized trials suggest 
PPIs  are  more  effective  than  H2-receptor  antagonists  in  reduction  of 
overt and clinically important UGIB without differences in mortality 
or nosocomial pneumonia.
OTHER  CAUSES  Less  common  causes  of  UGIB  include  neoplasms, 
vascular  ectasias  (including  hereditary  hemorrhagic  telangiectasias 
[Osler-Weber-Rendu] and gastric antral vascular ectasia [“watermelon 
stomach”]),  Dieulafoy’s  lesion  (in  which  an  aberrant  vessel  in  the 
mucosa bleeds from a pinpoint mucosal defect), prolapse gastropathy 
(prolapse of proximal stomach into esophagus with retching, especially 
in alcoholics), aortoenteric fistulas, and hemobilia or hemosuccus pan-
creaticus (bleeding from the bile duct or pancreatic duct).

Small-Intestinal Sources of Bleeding  Patients without a source 
of  GIB  identified  on  upper  endoscopy  and  colonoscopy  were  previ-
ously  labeled  as  having  obscure  GIB.  With  the  advent  of  improved 
diagnostic modalities, ~75% of GIB previously labeled obscure is now 
estimated  to  originate  in  the  small  intestine  beyond  the  extent  of  a 
standard  upper  endoscopic  exam.  Small-intestinal  GIB  may  account 
for  ~5%  of  GIB  cases.  The  most  common  causes  in  adults  include 
vascular  ectasias,  neoplasm  (e.g.,  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumor,  car-
cinoid, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, metastases), and NSAID-induced 
erosions and ulcers. Meckel’s diverticulum is the most common cause 
of significant small-intestinal GIB in children, decreasing in frequency 
as a cause of bleeding with age. Other less common causes of small- 
intestinal GIB include Crohn’s disease, infection, ischemia, vasculitis, 
small-bowel  varices,  diverticula,  intussusception,  Dieulafoy’s  lesions, 
aortoenteric fistulas, and duplication cysts.

Small-intestinal vascular ectasias are treated with endoscopic ther-
apy, if possible, based on observational studies suggesting initial effi-
cacy. However, rebleeding is common: 45% over a mean follow-up of 
26 months in a systematic review. Estrogen/progesterone compounds 
are not recommended because a multicenter double-blind trial found 
no  benefit  in  prevention  of  recurrent  bleeding.  Octreotide  is  used,

based on positive results from case series but no randomized trials. A 
randomized trial reported significant benefit of thalidomide and awaits 
further confirmation. Other isolated lesions, such as tumors, generally 
require surgical resection.

Colonic  Sources  of  Bleeding  Hemorrhoids  are  probably  the 
most  common  cause  of  lower  GIB  (LGIB);  anal  fissures  also  cause 
minor  bleeding  and  pain.  If  these  local  anal  processes,  which  rarely 
require  hospitalization,  are  excluded,  the  most  common  cause  of 
LGIB in adults is diverticulosis. Other causes include vascular ectasias 
(especially  in  the  proximal  colon  of  patients  >70  years),  neoplasms 
(primarily  adenocarcinoma),  colitis  (ischemic,  infectious,  Crohn’s  or 
ulcerative colitis, NSAID-induced colitis or ulcers), postpolypectomy 
bleeding, and radiation proctopathy. Rarer causes include solitary rec-
tal ulcer syndrome, varices (most commonly rectal), lymphoid nodular 
hyperplasia, vasculitis, trauma, and aortocolic fistulas. In children and 
adolescents,  the  most  common  colonic  causes  of  significant  GIB  are 
inflammatory bowel disease and juvenile polyps.

Diverticular bleeding is abrupt in onset, usually painless, sometimes 
massive,  and  often  from  the  right  colon;  chronic  or  occult  bleeding 
is  not  characteristic.  Case  series  from  the  United  States  and  Europe 
suggest  colonic  diverticula  stop  bleeding  spontaneously  in  ≥90%  of 
patients, with rebleeding on long-term follow-up as low as ~15% over 
4-5 years. Rebleeding is substantially higher in reports from Asia. Case 
series suggest endoscopic therapy may decrease recurrent bleeding in 
the uncommon case when colonoscopy identifies the specific bleeding 
diverticulum.  When  diverticular  bleeding  is  found  at  angiography, 
transcatheter  arterial  embolization  by  superselective  technique  stops 
bleeding in a majority of patients. Segmental surgical resection is rec-
ommended for persistent or refractory diverticular bleeding.

Bleeding  from  colonic  vascular  ectasias  may  be  overt  or  occult;  it 
tends  to  be  chronic  and  only  occasionally  hemodynamically  signifi-
cant.  Endoscopic  hemostatic  therapy  may  be  used  in  the  treatment 
of  vascular  ectasias,  as  well  as  discrete  bleeding  ulcers  and  post-
polypectomy  bleeding.  Transcatheter  arterial  embolization  also  may 
be attempted for persistent bleeding from vascular ectasias and other 
discrete lesions. Surgical therapy is generally required for major persis-
tent or recurrent bleeding from colonic sources that cannot be treated 
medically,  endoscopically,  or  angiographically.  Patients  with  Heyde’s 
syndrome  (bleeding  vascular  ectasias  and  aortic  stenosis)  appear  to 
benefit from aortic valve replacement.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Gastrointestinal Bleeding 

INITIAL ASSESSMENT
Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way 
to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding 
leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycar-
dia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, hemoglobin 
does  not  fall  immediately  with  acute  GIB,  due  to  proportionate 
reductions  in  plasma  and  red  cell  volumes  (“people  bleed  whole 
blood”).  Thus,  hemoglobin  may  be  normal  or  only  minimally 
decreased  at  initial  presentation  of  a  severe  bleeding  episode.  As 
extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the 
hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion 
is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based 
on  a  large  randomized  trial  showing  this  restrictive  transfusion 
strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared 
with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic 
GIB  may  have  very  low  hemoglobin  values  despite  normal  blood 
pressure  and  heart  rate.  With  the  development  of  iron-deficiency 
anemia,  the  mean  corpuscular  volume  is  low  and  red  blood  cell 
distribution width is increased. 
DIFFERENTIATION OF UGIB FROM LGIB
Hematemesis  indicates  an  UGIB  source.  Melena  indicates  blood 
has been present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract for ≥14 h and as

long  as  3–5  days.  The  more  proximal  the  bleeding  site,  the  more 
likely melena will occur. Hematochezia usually represents a lower 
GI source of bleeding, although an upper GI lesion may bleed so 
briskly that blood transits the bowel before melena develops. When 
hematochezia is the presenting symptom of UGIB, it is associated 
with hemodynamic instability and dropping hemoglobin. Bleeding 
lesions of the small bowel may present as melena or hematochezia. 
Other  clues  to  UGIB  include  hyperactive  bowel  sounds  and  an 
elevated blood urea nitrogen (due to volume depletion and blood 
proteins absorbed in the small intestine).

A  nonbloody  nasogastric  aspirate  may  be  seen  in  ~15%  of 
patients  with  UGIB  who  present  with  clinically  serious  hematoc-
hezia.  A  bile-stained  appearance  does  not  exclude  UGIB  because 
reports of bile in the aspirate are incorrect in ~50% of cases. Testing 
of aspirates that are not grossly bloody for occult blood is not useful. 

EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF UGIB (FIG. 48-1) 
Initial  Risk  Assessment  Baseline  characteristics  predictive  of 
rebleeding  and  death  include  hemodynamic  compromise  (tachy-
cardia  or  hypotension),  increasing  age,  and  comorbidities.  Risk 
assessment  tools  may  be  used  to  identify  patients  with  very  low 
risk. Discharge from the emergency room with outpatient manage-
ment  has  been  suggested  for  patients  with  a  Glasgow-Blatchford 
score (possible range 0–23, Table 48-1) of 0–1 because only ~1% of 
patients who require transfusion, require hemostatic intervention, 
or die have a score of 0–1. 
Pre-Endoscopic  Medications  PPI  infusion  may  be  considered 
at  presentation;  it  decreases  high-risk  ulcer  stigmata  (e.g.,  active 
bleeding)  and  need  for  endoscopic  therapy  but  does  not  improve 
clinical outcomes such as further bleeding, surgery, or death. The 
promotility agent erythromycin, 250 mg intravenously ~30–90 min 
before  endoscopy,  is  suggested  to  improve  visualization  at  endos-
copy, thereby reducing the need for repeat endoscopy and hospital 
stay.  Cirrhotic  patients  presenting  with  UGIB  should  be  given  an 
antibiotic  (e.g.,  ceftriaxone)  and  IV  vasoactive  medication  (e.g., 
octreotide) upon presentation. Antibiotics decrease bacterial infec-
tions,  rebleeding,  and  mortality,  and  vasoactive  medications  may 
improve control of bleeding in the 12 h after presentation. 
Endoscopy  Upper  endoscopy  should  be  performed  within  24  h   
in  most  patients  hospitalized  with  UGIB  whether  they  have  clin-
ical  features  predicting  low  risk  or  high  risk  of  further  bleeding

and  death.  Even  in  high-risk  patients,  more  urgent  endoscopy 
(performed within 6 h of gastroenterology consultation) does not 
improve  clinical  outcomes.  Early  endoscopy  in  low-risk  patients 
(e.g., hemodynamically stable without severe comorbidities) identi-
fies low-risk findings (e.g., clean-based ulcers, erosions, nonbleed-
ing Mallory-Weiss tears) that allow discharge in ≥40% of patients, 
thereby  reducing  hospital  stay  and  costs.  Patients  with  high-risk 
endoscopic findings (e.g., varices, ulcers with active bleeding or a 
visible vessel) benefit from hemostatic therapy at endoscopy. 
EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF LGIB (FIG. 48-2)
Patients  with  hematochezia  and  hemodynamic  instability  should 
have upper endoscopy to rule out an upper GI source before evalu-
ation of the lower GI tract.

Colonoscopy  after  an  oral  lavage  solution  is  the  procedure  of 
choice in most patients admitted with LGIB unless bleeding is too 
massive,  in  which  case  angiography  is  recommended.  Computed 
tomography  (CT)  angiography  is  often  suggested  prior  to  angi-
ography  to  document  evidence  and  location  of  active  bleeding. 
Sigmoidoscopy  is  used  primarily  in  patients  <40  years  old  with 
minor bleeding. In patients with no source identified on colonos-
copy, imaging studies may be employed. 99mTc-labeled red cell scan 
allows repeated imaging for up to 24 h and may identify the general 
location of bleeding. However, CT angiography is increasingly used 
instead because it is likely superior and more readily available. In 
active LGIB, angiography can detect the site of bleeding (extravasa-
tion of contrast into the gut) and permits treatment with transcath-
eter arterial embolization. 
EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF SMALL-INTESTINAL OR 
OBSCURE GIB
In  patients  with  massive  bleeding  suspected  to  be  from  the  small 
intestine,  current  guidelines  suggest  angiography  as  the  initial 
test,  with  CT  angiography  or  99mTc-labeled  red  cell  scan  prior  to 

angiography  if  the  patient’s  clinical  status  permits.  For  others, 
repeat upper and lower endoscopy may be considered as the initial 
evaluation because second-look procedures identify a source in up 
to ~25% of upper endoscopies and colonoscopies; a push enteros-
copy,  usually  performed  with  a  pediatric  colonoscope  to  inspect 
the  entire  duodenum  and  proximal  jejunum,  may  be  substituted 
for a repeat standard upper endoscopy. If second-look procedures 
are negative, evaluation of the entire small intestine is performed, 
usually with video capsule endoscopy. A systematic review of com-
parative studies showed the yield of “clinically significant findings” 
to be greater with capsule than push enteroscopy (56% vs 26%) or 
small  bowel  barium  radiography  (42%  vs  6%).  However,  capsule 
endoscopy does not allow full visualization of the small intestine, 
tissue sampling, or application of therapy.

CT enterography may be used initially instead of video capsule in 
patients with possible small bowel narrowing (e.g., stricture, prior 
surgery  or  radiation,  Crohn’s  disease)  and  may  follow  a  negative 
video  capsule  for  suspected  small-intestinal  GIB,  given  its  higher 
sensitivity for small-intestinal masses.

If  capsule  endoscopy  is  positive,  management  is  dictated  by  the 
finding.  If  capsule  endoscopy  is  negative,  clinically  stable  patients 
may  be  observed  and  treated  with  iron  if  iron  deficiency  is  pres-
ent, while those with ongoing bleeding (e.g., need for transfusions) 
undergo further testing. A second capsule endoscopy may be consid-
ered because it is reported to identify a source in up to ~50% of cases. 
“Deep”  enteroscopy  (double-balloon,  single-balloon,  or  spiral  ent-
eroscopy) is commonly the next test after capsule endoscopy for clin-
ically important GIB documented or suspected to be from the small 
intestine because it allows the endoscopist to examine, obtain speci-
mens from, and provide therapy to much or all of the small intestine. 
Other imaging techniques sometimes used in evaluation of obscure 
GIB include  99mTc-labeled red blood cell scintigraphy, CT angiogra-
phy, angiography, and  99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy for Meckel’s

49 Jaundice

Savio John, Daniel S. Pratt

Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of body tissues resulting from the 
deposition  of  bilirubin.  Tissue  deposition  of  bilirubin  occurs  only  in 
the presence of serum hyperbilirubinemia and is a sign of either liver 
disease  or,  less  often,  a  hemolytic  disorder  or  disorder  of  bilirubin 
metabolism. The degree of serum bilirubin elevation can be estimated 
by physical examination. Slight increases in serum bilirubin level are 
best detected by examining the sclerae for icterus. Sclerae have a par-
ticular affinity for bilirubin due to their high elastin content, and the 
presence of scleral icterus indicates a serum bilirubin level of at least 
51 μmol/L (3 mg/dL). The ability to detect scleral icterus is made more 
difficult if the examining room has fluorescent lighting. If the exam-
iner  suspects  scleral  icterus,  a  second  site  to  examine  is  underneath 
the  tongue.  As  serum  bilirubin  levels  rise,  the  skin  will  eventually 
become yellow in light-skinned patients and even green if the process 
is long-standing; the green color is produced by oxidation of bilirubin 
to biliverdin.

The  differential  diagnosis  for  yellowing  of  the  skin  is  limited.  In 
addition  to  jaundice,  it  includes  carotenoderma;  the  use  of  drugs 
including quinacrine, sunitinib, and sorafenib; and excessive exposure 
to phenols. Carotenoderma, a yellow coloring of the skin, is associated 
with diabetes, hypothyroidism, and anorexia nervosa, but most com-
monly, it is caused by the ingestion of an excessive amounts of vege-
tables and fruits such as carrots, leafy vegetables, squash, peaches, and

oranges that contain carotene. In jaundice, the yellow coloration of the 
skin is uniformly distributed over the body, whereas in carotenoderma, 
the pigment is concentrated on the palms, soles, forehead, and nasol-
abial folds. Carotenoderma can be distinguished from jaundice by the 
sparing of the sclerae. Quinacrine causes a yellow discoloration of the 
skin in 4–37% of patients treated with it. It has also been reported with 
the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib.

Another  sensitive  indicator  of  increased  serum  bilirubin  is  dark-
ening of the urine, which is due to the renal excretion of conjugated 
bilirubin. Patients often describe their urine as tea- or cola-colored. Bil-
irubinuria indicates an elevation of the direct serum bilirubin fraction 
and, therefore, the presence of liver or biliary disease.

Serum bilirubin levels increase when an imbalance exists between 
bilirubin production and clearance. A logical evaluation of the patient 
who  is  jaundiced  requires  an  understanding  of  bilirubin  production 
and metabolism.

 ■ PRODUCTION AND METABOLISM OF BILIRUBIN
(See  Chap.  338)  Bilirubin,  a  tetrapyrrole  pigment,  is  a  breakdown 
product  of  heme  (ferroprotoporphyrin  IX).  About  80–85%  of  the  
4 mg/kg body weight of bilirubin produced each day is derived from 
the  breakdown  of  hemoglobin  in  senescent  red  blood  cells.  The 
remainder comes from prematurely destroyed erythroid cells in bone 
marrow and from the turnover of hemoproteins such as myoglobin and 
cytochromes found in tissues throughout the body.

The  formation  of  bilirubin  occurs  in  reticuloendothelial  cells, 
primarily  in  the  spleen  and  liver.  The  first  reaction,  catalyzed  by  the 
microsomal enzyme heme oxygenase, oxidatively cleaves the α bridge 
of  the  porphyrin  group  and  opens  the  heme  ring.  The  end  products 
of  this  reaction  are  biliverdin,  carbon  monoxide,  and  iron.  The  sec-
ond reaction, catalyzed by the cytosolic enzyme biliverdin reductase, 
reduces  the  central  methylene  bridge  of  biliverdin  and  converts  it  to 
bilirubin. Bilirubin formed in the reticuloendothelial cells is virtually 
insoluble  in  water  due  to  tight  internal  hydrogen  bonding  between 
the  water-soluble  moieties  of  bilirubin—that  is,  the  bonding  of  the 
propionic acid carboxyl groups of one dipyrrolic half of the molecule 
with the imino and lactam groups of the opposite half. This configura-
tion blocks solvent access to the polar residues of bilirubin and places 
the hydrophobic residues on the outside. To be transported in blood, 
bilirubin  must  be  solubilized.  Solubilization  is  accomplished  by  the 
reversible, noncovalent binding of bilirubin to albumin. Unconjugated 
bilirubin  bound  to  albumin  is  transported  to  the  liver.  There,  the  
bilirubin—but not the albumin—is taken up by hepatocytes via a pro-
cess that at least partly involves carrier-mediated membrane transport. 
No specific bilirubin transporter has yet been identified  (Chap. 338, 
Fig. 338-1).

After  entering  the  hepatocyte,  unconjugated  bilirubin  is  bound 
in  the  cytosol  to  several  proteins  including  proteins  in  the  glutathi-
one-S-transferase  superfamily.  These  proteins  serve  both  to  reduce 
efflux of bilirubin back into the serum and to present the bilirubin for 
conjugation. In the endoplasmic reticulum, bilirubin is made aqueous 
soluble by conjugation to glucuronic acid, a process that disrupts the 
hydrophobic  internal  hydrogen  bonds  and  yields  bilirubin  monoglu-
curonide  and  diglucuronide.  The  conjugation  of  glucuronic  acid  to 
bilirubin  is  catalyzed  by  bilirubin  uridine  diphosphate-glucuronosyl 
transferase  (UDPGT).  The  now-hydrophilic  bilirubin  conjugates  dif-
fuse  from  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  to  the  canalicular  membrane, 
where  bilirubin  monoglucuronide  and  diglucuronide  are  actively 
transported into canalicular bile by an energy-dependent mechanism 
involving  the  multidrug  resistance–associated  protein  2  (MRP2).  A 
portion  of  bilirubin  glucuronides  is  transported  into  the  sinusoids 
and portal circulation by MRP3 and is subjected to reuptake into the 
hepatocyte  by  the  sinusoidal  organic  anion  transport  protein  1B1 
(OATP1B1) and OATP1B3. The conjugated bilirubin excreted into bile 
drains into the duodenum and passes unchanged through the proximal 
small bowel. Conjugated bilirubin is not reabsorbed by the intestinal 
mucosa due to its hydrophilicity and increased molecular size. When 
the  conjugated  bilirubin  reaches  the  distal  ileum  and  colon,  it  is 
hydrolyzed  to  unconjugated  bilirubin  by  bacterial  β-glucuronidases.

316 The  unconjugated  bilirubin  is  reduced  by  normal  gut  bacteria  to 
form a group of colorless tetrapyrroles called urobilinogens and other 
products,  the  nature  and  relative  amounts  of  which  depend  on  the 
bacterial flora. About 80–90% of these products are excreted in feces, 
either  unchanged  or  oxidized  to  orange  derivatives  called  urobilins. 
The  remaining  10–20%  of  the  urobilinogens  undergo  enterohepatic 
cycling.  A  small  fraction  (usually  <3  mg/dL)  escapes  hepatic  uptake, 
filters across the renal glomerulus, and is excreted in urine. Increased 
urinary  excretion  of  urobilinogen  can  be  due  to  increased  bilirubin 
production,  increased  hepatic  reabsorption  of  urobilinogen  from  the 
colon, or decreased hepatic clearance of urobilinogen.

 ■ MEASUREMENT OF SERUM BILIRUBIN
The  terms  direct  and  indirect  bilirubin—that  is,  conjugated  and 
unconjugated  bilirubin,  respectively—are  based  on  the  original  van 
den Bergh reaction. This assay, or a variation of it, is still used in most 
clinical chemistry laboratories to determine the serum bilirubin level. 
In this assay, bilirubin is exposed to diazotized sulfanilic acid and splits 
into  two  relatively  stable  dipyrrylmethene  azopigments  that  absorb 
maximally at 540 nm, allowing photometric analysis. The direct frac-
tion is that which reacts with diazotized sulfanilic acid in the absence of 
an accelerator substance such as alcohol. The direct fraction provides 
an approximation of the conjugated bilirubin level in serum. The total 
serum bilirubin is the amount that reacts after the addition of alcohol. 
The indirect fraction is the difference between the total and the direct 
bilirubin  levels  and  provides  an  estimate  of  the  unconjugated  biliru-
bin in serum. Unconjugated bilirubin also reacts with diazo reagents, 
albeit slowly, even when the accelerator is absent. Thus, the calculated 
indirect bilirubin may underestimate the true amount of unconjugated 
bilirubin in circulation.

With the van den Bergh method, the normal serum bilirubin con-
centration  usually  is  between  17  and  26  μmol/L  (1  and  1.5  mg/dL). 
Total serum bilirubin concentrations are between 3.4 and 15.4 μmol/L 
(0.2  and  0.9  mg/dL)  in  95%  of  a  normal  population.  Unconjugated 
hyperbilirubinemia  is  present  when  the  direct  fraction  is  <15%  of 
the  total  serum  bilirubin.  The  presence  of  even  limited  amounts  of 
true  conjugated  bilirubin  in  serum  suggests  significant  hepatobiliary 
pathology. As conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is always associated with 
bilirubinuria  (except  in  the  presence  of  delta  bilirubin  in  prolonged 
cholestasis when jaundice is overt), detection of bilirubin in urine via 
dipstick test is extremely helpful to confirm the presence of conjugated 
hyperbilirubinemia in a patient with mildly elevated direct fraction.

Several new techniques, although less convenient to perform, have 
added  considerably  to  our  understanding  of  bilirubin  metabolism. 
First, studies using these methods demonstrate that, in normal persons 
or those with Gilbert’s syndrome, almost 100% of the serum bilirubin is 
unconjugated; <3% is monoconjugated bilirubin. Second, in jaundiced 
patients with hepatobiliary disease, the total serum bilirubin concen-
tration measured by these new, more accurate methods is lower than 
the values found with diazo methods. This finding suggests that there 
are diazo-positive compounds distinct from bilirubin in the serum of 
patients with hepatobiliary disease. Third, these studies indicate that, 
in  jaundiced  patients  with  hepatobiliary  disease,  monoglucuronides 
of  bilirubin  predominate  over  diglucuronides.  Fourth,  part  of  the 
direct-reacting bilirubin fraction includes conjugated bilirubin that is 
covalently linked to albumin. This albumin-linked fraction of conju-
gated bilirubin (delta fraction, delta bilirubin, or biliprotein) represents 
an important fraction of total serum bilirubin in patients with cholesta-
sis and hepatobiliary disorders. The delta bilirubin is formed in serum 
when hepatic excretion of bilirubin glucuronides is impaired and the 
glucuronides  accumulate  in  serum.  By  virtue  of  its  tight  binding  to 
albumin, the clearance rate of delta bilirubin from serum approximates 
the half-life of albumin (12–14 days) rather than the short half-life of 
bilirubin (about 4 h).

The  prolonged  half-life  of  albumin-bound  conjugated  bilirubin 
accounts for two previously unexplained enigmas in jaundiced patients 
with liver disease: (1) that some patients with conjugated hyperbiliru-
binemia do not exhibit bilirubinuria during the recovery phase of their 

disease because the delta bilirubin, although conjugated, is covalently 
bound  to  albumin  and  therefore  not  filtered  by  the  renal  glomeruli, 
and  (2)  that  the  elevated  serum  bilirubin  level  declines  more  slowly 
than expected in some patients who otherwise appear to be recovering 
satisfactorily. Late in the recovery phase of hepatobiliary disorders, all 
the conjugated bilirubin may be in the albumin-linked form.
 ■ MEASUREMENT OF URINE BILIRUBIN
Unconjugated  bilirubin  is  always  bound  to  albumin  in  the  serum,  is 
not  filtered  by  the  kidney,  and  is  not  found  in  the  urine.  Conjugated 
bilirubin  is  filtered  at  the  glomerulus,  and  the  majority  is  reabsorbed 
by  the  proximal  tubules;  a  small  fraction  is  excreted  in  the  urine. 
Any  bilirubin  found  in  the  urine  is  conjugated  bilirubin.  The  presence 
of  bilirubinuria  on  urine  dipstick  test  (Ictotest)  indicates  an  eleva-
tion  of  the  conjugated  bilirubin  fraction  that  cannot  be  excreted  from 
the  liver  and  implies  the  presence  of  hepatobiliary  disease.  A  false- 
negative result is possible in patients with prolonged cholestasis due to the 
predominance  of  delta  bilirubin,  which  is  covalently  bound  to  albumin 
and therefore not filtered by the renal glomeruli.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT 
Jaundice

The goal of this chapter is not to provide an encyclopedic review of 
every condition that causes jaundice. Rather, the chapter is intended 
to offer a framework that helps a physician to evaluate the patient 
with jaundice in a logical way (Fig. 49-1).

The  initial  step  is  to  perform  appropriate  blood  tests  in  order 
to  determine  whether  the  patient  has  an  isolated  elevation  of 
serum bilirubin. If so, is the bilirubin elevation due to an increased 
unconjugated or conjugated fraction? If the hyperbilirubinemia is 
accompanied by other liver test abnormalities, is the disorder hepa-
tocellular or cholestatic? If cholestatic, is it intra- or extrahepatic? 
These questions can all be answered with a thoughtful history, phys-
ical  examination,  and  interpretation  of  laboratory  and  radiologic 
tests and procedures.

The  bilirubin  present  in  serum  represents  a  balance  between 
input from the production of bilirubin and hepatic/biliary removal 
of the pigment. Hyperbilirubinemia may result from (1) overpro-
duction of bilirubin; (2) impaired uptake, conjugation, or excretion 
of  bilirubin;  or  (3)  regurgitation  of  unconjugated  or  conjugated 
bilirubin  from  damaged  hepatocytes  or  bile  ducts.  An  increase 
in  unconjugated  bilirubin  in  serum  results  from  overproduction, 
impaired uptake, or conjugation of bilirubin. An increase in conju-
gated bilirubin is due to decreased excretion into the bile ductules 
or backward leakage of the pigment. The initial steps in evaluating 
the patient with jaundice are to determine (1) whether the hyperbi-
lirubinemia is predominantly conjugated or unconjugated in nature 
and  (2)  whether  other  biochemical  liver  tests  are  abnormal.  The 
thoughtful interpretation of limited data permits a rational evalua-
tion of the patient (Fig. 49-1). The following discussion will focus 
solely on the evaluation of the adult patient with jaundice. 

ISOLATED ELEVATION OF SERUM BILIRUBIN 
Unconjugated  Hyperbilirubinemia  The  differential  diagnosis  of 
isolated  unconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia  is  limited  (Table 49-1). 
The critical determination is whether the patient is suffering from 
a  hemolytic  process  resulting  in  an  overproduction  of  biliru-
bin  (hemolytic  disorders  and  ineffective  erythropoiesis)  or  from 
impaired  hepatic  uptake/conjugation  of  bilirubin  (drug  effect  or 
genetic disorders).

Hemolytic disorders that cause excessive heme production may 
be either inherited or acquired. Inherited disorders include sphero-
cytosis,  sickle  cell  anemia,  thalassemia,  and  deficiency  of  red  cell 
enzymes  such  as  pyruvate  kinase  and  glucose-6-phosphate  dehy-
drogenase.  In  these  conditions,  the  serum  bilirubin  level  rarely 
exceeds 86 μmol/L (5 mg/dL). Higher levels may occur when there

is coexistent renal or hepatocellular dysfunction or in acute hemo-
lysis, such as a sickle cell crisis. In evaluating jaundice in patients 
with chronic hemolysis, it is important to remember the high inci-
dence of pigmented (calcium bilirubinate) gallstones found in these 
patients, which increases the likelihood of choledocholithiasis as an 
alternative explanation for hyperbilirubinemia.

Acquired hemolytic disorders include microangiopathic hemo-
lytic  anemia  (e.g.,  hemolytic-uremic  syndrome),  paroxysmal 
nocturnal  hemoglobinuria,  spur  cell  anemia,  immune  hemolysis, 
and  parasitic  infections  (e.g.,  malaria  and  babesiosis).  Ineffective 
erythropoiesis  occurs  in  cobalamin,  folate,  and  iron  deficiencies. 
Resorption  of  hematomas  and  massive  blood  transfusions  both 
can result in increased hemoglobin release and overproduction of 
bilirubin.

In  the  absence  of  hemolysis,  the  physician  should  consider 
a  problem  with  the  hepatic  uptake  or  conjugation  of  bilirubin. 
Certain  drugs,  including  rifampin  and  probenecid,  may  cause 
unconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia  by  diminishing  hepatic  uptake

of bilirubin. Impaired bilirubin conjugation occurs in three genetic 
conditions:  Crigler-Najjar  syndrome  types  I  and  II  and  Gilbert’s 
syndrome.  Crigler-Najjar  type  I  is  an  exceptionally  rare  condition 
found in neonates and characterized by severe jaundice (bilirubin 
>342 μmol/L [>20 mg/dL]) and neurologic impairment due to ker-
nicterus, frequently leading to death in infancy or childhood. These 
patients have a complete absence of bilirubin UDPGT activity; are 
totally unable to conjugate bilirubin; and hence cannot excrete it.

Crigler-Najjar type II is somewhat more common than type I. Patients 
live  into  adulthood  with  serum  bilirubin  levels  of  103–428  μmol/L 
(6–25 mg/dL). In these patients, mutations in the bilirubin UDPGT 
gene cause the reduction—typically ≤10%—of the enzyme’s activity. 
Bilirubin UDPGT activity can be induced by the administration of 
phenobarbital,  which  can  reduce  serum  bilirubin  levels  in  these 
patients.  Despite  marked  jaundice,  these  patients  usually  survive 
into  adulthood,  although  they  may  be  susceptible  to  kernicterus 
under the stress of concurrent illness or surgery.

Gilbert’s  syndrome  is  also  marked  by  the  impaired  conjugation 
of  bilirubin  due  to  reduced  bilirubin  UDPGT  activity  (typically 
10–35%  of  normal).  Patients  with  Gilbert’s  syndrome  have  mild 
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with serum levels almost always 
<103 μmol/L (6 mg/dL). The serum levels may fluctuate, and jaun-
dice is often identified only during periods of stress, concurrent ill-
ness, alcohol use, or fasting. Unlike both Crigler-Najjar syndromes, 
Gilbert’s  syndrome  is  very  common.  The  reported  incidence  is 
3–7% of the population, with males predominating over females by 
a ratio of 1.5–7:1. 

Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia  Elevated conjugated hyperbiliru-
binemia is found in two rare inherited conditions: Dubin-Johnson 
syndrome  and  Rotor  syndrome  (Table  49-1).  Patients  with  either 
condition  present  with  asymptomatic  jaundice.  The  defect  in 
Dubin-Johnson syndrome is the presence of mutations in the gene 
for  MRP2.  These  patients  have  altered  excretion  of  bilirubin  into 
the  bile  ducts.  Rotor  syndrome  may  represent  a  deficiency  of  the 
major hepatic drug reuptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
Differentiating between these syndromes is possible but is clinically 
unnecessary due to their benign nature. 

ELEVATION OF SERUM BILIRUBIN WITH OTHER LIVER TEST 
ABNORMALITIES
The  remainder  of  this  chapter  will  focus  on  the  evaluation  of 
patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of other 
liver test abnormalities. This group of patients can be divided into 
those with a primary hepatocellular process and those with intra- 
or extrahepatic cholestasis. This distinction, which is based on the 
history and physical examination as well as the pattern of liver test 
abnormalities, guides the clinician’s evaluation (Fig. 49-1). 

History  A  complete  medical  history  is  perhaps  the  single  most 
important  part  of  the  evaluation  of  the  patient  with  unexplained 
jaundice.  Important  considerations  include  the  use  of  or  exposure 
to any chemical or medication, whether physician-prescribed, over-
the-counter,  complementary,  or  alternative  medicines  (e.g.,  herbal 
and vitamin preparations) or other drugs such as anabolic steroids. 
The patient should be carefully questioned about possible parenteral 
exposures,  including  transfusions,  intravenous  and  intranasal  drug 
use,  tattooing,  and  sexual  activity.  Other  important  points  include 
recent  travel  history;  exposure  to  people  with  jaundice;  exposure 
to  possibly  contaminated  foods;  occupational  exposure  to  hepa-
totoxins;  alcohol  consumption;  the  duration  of  jaundice;  and  the 
presence  of  any  accompanying  signs  and  symptoms,  such  as  arth-
ralgias, myalgias, rash, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, 
pruritus, and changes in the urine and stool. While none of the latter 
manifestations  is  specific  for  any  one  condition,  any  of  them  can 
suggest a diagnosis. A history of arthralgias and myalgias predating 
jaundice  suggests  hepatitis,  either  viral  or  drug  related.  Jaundice 
associated  with  the  sudden  onset  of  severe  right-upper-quadrant 

pain and shaking chills suggests choledocholithiasis and ascending 
cholangitis. 
Physical  Examination  The  general  assessment  should  include 
evaluation of the patient’s nutritional status. Temporal and proximal 
muscle  wasting  suggests  long-standing  disease  such  as  pancreatic 
cancer  or  cirrhosis.  Stigmata  of  chronic  liver  disease,  including 
spider  nevi,  palmar  erythema,  gynecomastia,  caput  medusae, 
Dupuytren’s contractures, parotid gland enlargement, and testicular 
atrophy, are commonly seen in advanced alcohol-related cirrhosis 
and occasionally in other types of cirrhosis. An enlarged left supr-
aclavicular node (Virchow’s node) or a periumbilical nodule (Sister 
Mary Joseph’s nodule) suggests an abdominal malignancy. Jugular 
venous  distention,  a  sign  of  right-sided  heart  failure,  suggests 
hepatic  congestion.  Right  pleural  effusion  even  in  the  absence  of 
clinically apparent ascites may be seen in advanced cirrhosis.

The abdominal examination should focus on the size and con-
sistency  of the liver,  on whether the spleen is palpable and hence 
enlarged, and on whether ascites is present. Patients with cirrhosis 
may have an enlarged left lobe of the liver, which is felt below the 
xiphoid, and an enlarged spleen. A grossly enlarged nodular liver 
or  an  obvious  abdominal  mass  suggests  malignancy.  An  enlarged 
tender liver could signify viral or alcoholic hepatitis; an infiltrative 
process such as amyloidosis; or, less often, an acutely congested liver 
secondary to right-sided heart failure. Severe right-upper-quadrant 
tenderness  with  respiratory  arrest  on  inspiration  (Murphy’s  sign) 
suggests cholecystitis. Ascites in the presence of jaundice suggests 
either cirrhosis or malignancy with peritoneal spread. 
Laboratory Tests  A battery of tests are helpful in the initial evalua-
tion of a patient with unexplained jaundice. These include total and 
direct serum bilirubin measurement with fractionation; determina-
tion of serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin 
concentrations; and prothrombin time tests. Enzyme tests (alanine 
aminotransferase  [ALT],  aspartate  aminotransferase  [AST],  and 
alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) are helpful in differentiating between 
a  hepatocellular  process  and  a  cholestatic  process  (Table  337-1; 
Fig. 49-1)—a critical step in determining what additional workup 
is  indicated.  Patients  with  a  hepatocellular  process  generally  have 
a  rise  in  the  aminotransferases  that  is  disproportionate  to  that  in 
ALP, whereas patients with a cholestatic process have a rise in ALP 
that is disproportionate to that of the aminotransferases. The serum 
bilirubin  can  be  prominently  elevated  in  both  hepatocellular  and 
cholestatic  conditions  and  therefore  is  not  necessarily  helpful  in 
differentiating between the two.

In addition to enzyme tests, all jaundiced patients should have 
additional blood tests—specifically, an albumin level and a proth-
rombin time—to assess liver function. A low albumin level suggests 
a  chronic  process  such  as  cirrhosis  or  cancer.  A  normal  albumin 
level is suggestive of a more acute process such as viral hepatitis or 
choledocholithiasis. An elevated prothrombin time indicates either 
vitamin K deficiency due to prolonged jaundice and malabsorption 
of vitamin K or significant hepatocellular dysfunction. The failure 
of the prothrombin time to correct with parenteral administration of 
vitamin K indicates severe hepatocellular injury.

The results of the bilirubin, enzyme, albumin, and prothrombin 
time  tests  will  usually  indicate  whether  a  jaundiced  patient  has  a 
hepatocellular or a cholestatic disease and offer some indication of 
the duration and severity of the disease. The causes and evaluations 
of hepatocellular and cholestatic diseases are quite different. 
Hepatocellular Conditions  Hepatocellular diseases that can cause 
jaundice  include  viral  hepatitis,  drug  or  environmental  toxicity, 
alcohol,  and  end-stage  cirrhosis  from  any  cause  (Table  49-2). 
Wilson’s  disease  occurs  primarily  in  young  adults.  Autoimmune 
hepatitis is typically seen in young to middle-aged women but may 
affect men and women of any age. Alcoholic hepatitis can be differ-
entiated from viral and toxin-related hepatitis by the pattern of the 
aminotransferases:  patients  with  alcoholic  hepatitis  typically  have

an AST-to-ALT ratio of at least 2:1, and the AST level rarely exceeds 
300 U/L. Patients with acute viral hepatitis and toxin-related injury 
severe enough to produce jaundice typically have aminotransferase 
levels  >500  U/L,  with  the  ALT  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  AST. 
While ALT and AST values <8 times normal may be seen in either 
hepatocellular or cholestatic liver disease, values 25 times normal or 
higher are seen primarily in acute hepatocellular diseases. Patients 
with jaundice from cirrhosis can have normal or only slightly ele-
vated aminotransferase levels.

When the clinician determines that a patient has a hepatocellular 
disease, appropriate testing for acute viral hepatitis includes a hep-
atitis A IgM antibody assay, a hepatitis B surface antigen and core 
IgM antibody assay, a hepatitis C viral RNA test, and, depending on 
the circumstances, a hepatitis E IgM antibody assay. The hepatitis 
C antibody can take up to 6 weeks to become detectable, making 
it  an  unreliable  test  if  acute  hepatitis  C  is  suspected.  Studies  for 
hepatitis D, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
may also be indicated. Ceruloplasmin is the initial screening test for 
Wilson’s disease. Testing for autoimmune hepatitis usually includes 
antinuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody assays and 
measurement of specific immunoglobulins.

Drug-induced  hepatocellular  injury  can  be  classified  as  either 
predictable  or  unpredictable.  Predictable  drug  reactions  are 
dose-dependent  and  affect  all  patients  who  ingest  a  toxic  dose  of 
the drug in question. The classic example is acetaminophen hepa-
totoxicity.  Unpredictable  or  idiosyncratic  drug  reactions  are  not 
dose-dependent and occur in a minority of patients. A great num-
ber of drugs can cause idiosyncratic hepatic injury. Environmental 
toxins are also an important cause of hepatocellular injury. Exam-
ples  include  industrial  chemicals  such  as  vinyl  chloride,  herbal 
preparations containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids (Jamaica bush tea) 
or  kava,  and  the  mushrooms  Amanita  phalloides  and  A.  verna, 
which contain highly hepatotoxic amatoxins. 
Cholestatic  Conditions  When  the  pattern  of  the  liver  tests  sug-
gests  a  cholestatic  disorder,  the  first  step  is  to  determine  whether 
it  is  intra-  or  extrahepatic  cholestasis  (Fig.  49-1).  Distinguishing 
intrahepatic from extrahepatic cholestasis may be difficult. History, 
physical  examination,  and  laboratory  tests  often  are  not  helpful. 
The next appropriate test is an ultrasound. The ultrasound is inex-
pensive, does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, and can 
detect dilation of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree with a high 
degree of sensitivity and specificity. The absence of biliary dilation 
suggests intrahepatic cholestasis, while its presence indicates extra-
hepatic  cholestasis.  False-negative  results  occur  in  patients  with 

partial  obstruction  of  the  common  bile  duct  or  in  patients  with 
cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), in which scarring 
prevents the intrahepatic ducts from dilating.

Although  ultrasonography  may  indicate  extrahepatic  cholesta-
sis,  it  rarely  identifies  the  site  or  cause  of  obstruction.  The  distal 
common  bile  duct  is  a  particularly  difficult  area  to  visualize  by 
ultrasound because of overlying bowel gas. Appropriate next tests 
include  computed  tomography  (CT),  magnetic  resonance  cholan-
giopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan-
creatography (ERCP), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography 
(PTC),  and  endoscopic  ultrasound  (EUS).  CT  and  MRCP  are 
better than ultrasonography for assessing the head of the pancreas 
and  for  identifying  choledocholithiasis  in  the  distal  common  bile 
duct, particularly when the ducts are not dilated. ERCP is the “gold 
standard” for identifying choledocholithiasis. Beyond its diagnostic 
capabilities,  ERCP  allows  therapeutic  interventions,  including  the 
removal of common bile duct stones and the placement of stents. 
PTC can provide the same information as ERCP and it also allows 
for intervention in patients in whom ERCP is unsuccessful due to 
proximal  biliary  obstruction  or  altered  gastrointestinal  anatomy. 
MRCP  has  replaced  ERCP  as  the  initial  diagnostic  test  in  most 
cases. EUS displays sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of 
MRCP in the detection of bile duct obstruction and allows biopsy 
of suspected malignant lesions.

In patients with apparent intrahepatic cholestasis, the diagnosis is 
often made by serologic testing in combination with a liver biopsy. 
The  list  of  possible  causes  of  intrahepatic  cholestasis  is  long  and 
varied  (Table  49-3).  A  number  of  conditions  that  typically  cause 
a hepatocellular pattern of injury can also present as a cholestatic 
variant. Both hepatitis B and C viruses can cause cholestatic hepa-
titis (fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis). This disease variant has been 
reported  in  patients  who  have  undergone  solid  organ  transplan-
tation.  Hepatitis  A  and  E,  alcoholic  hepatitis,  and  EBV  or  CMV 
infections may also present as cholestatic liver disease.

Drugs may cause intrahepatic cholestasis that is usually revers-
ible  after  discontinuation  of  the  offending  agent,  although  it  may 
take many months for cholestasis to resolve. Drugs most commonly 
associated with cholestasis are the anabolic and contraceptive ste-
roids. Cholestatic hepatitis has been reported with chlorpromazine, 
imipramine,  tolbutamide,  sulindac,  cimetidine,  and  erythromy-
cin  estolate.  It  also  occurs  in  patients  taking  trimethoprim;  sul-
famethoxazole; and penicillin-based antibiotics such as ampicillin, 
dicloxacillin, and clavulanic acid. Rarely, cholestasis may be chronic 
and associated with progressive fibrosis despite early discontinua-
tion of the offending drug. Chronic cholestasis has been associated 
with chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine.

Primary  biliary  cholangitis  is  an  autoimmune  disease  predomi-
nantly affecting women and characterized by progressive destruc-
tion  of  interlobular  bile  ducts.  The  diagnosis  is  made  by  the 
detection  of  antimitochondrial  antibody,  which  is  found  in  95% 
of  patients.  Primary  sclerosing  cholangitis  is  characterized  by  the 
destruction and fibrosis of larger bile ducts. The diagnosis of PSC is 
made with cholangiography (either MRCP or ERCP), which dem-
onstrates the pathognomonic segmental strictures. Approximately 
75% of patients with PSC also have inflammatory bowel disease.

The vanishing bile duct syndrome and  adult bile ductopenia are 
rare conditions in which a decreased number of bile ducts are seen 
in  liver  biopsy  specimens.  This  histologic  picture  is  also  seen  in 
patients  who  develop  chronic  rejection  after  liver  transplantation 
and in those who develop graft-versus-host disease after bone mar-
row transplantation. Vanishing bile duct syndrome also occurs in 
rare cases of sarcoidosis, in patients taking certain drugs (including 
chlorpromazine), and idiopathically.

There  are  also  familial  forms  of  intrahepatic  cholestasis.  The 
familial  intrahepatic  cholestatic  syndromes  include  progressive 
familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) types 1–3 and benign recurrent 
intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) types 1 and 2. BRIC is characterized

condition is probably inherited, and cholestasis can be triggered by 
estrogen administration.

Other  causes  of  intrahepatic  cholestasis  include  total  parent-
eral  nutrition  (TPN);  nonhepatobiliary  sepsis;  benign  postoper-
ative  cholestasis;  and  a  paraneoplastic  syndrome  associated  with 
a  number  of  different  malignancies,  including  Hodgkin’s  disease, 
medullary  thyroid  cancer,  renal  cell  cancer,  renal  sarcoma,  T-cell 
lymphoma, prostate cancer, and several gastrointestinal malignan-
cies.  The  term  Stauffer’s  syndrome  has  been  used  for  intrahepatic 
cholestasis specifically associated with renal cell cancer. In patients 
developing  cholestasis  in  the  intensive  care  unit,  the  major  con-
siderations  should  be  sepsis,  ischemic  hepatitis  (“shock  liver”), 
and  TPN-related  jaundice.  Jaundice  occurring  after  bone  marrow 
transplantation is most likely due to veno-occlusive disease or graft-
versus-host  disease.  In  addition  to  hemolysis,  sickle  cell  disease 
may  cause  intrahepatic  and  extrahepatic  cholestasis.  Jaundice  is  a 
late finding in heart failure caused by hepatic congestion and hepa-
tocellular  hypoxia.  Ischemic  hepatitis  is  a  distinct  entity  of  acute 
hypoperfusion characterized by an acute and dramatic elevation in 
the serum aminotransferases followed by a gradual peak in serum 
bilirubin.

Jaundice with associated liver dysfunction can be seen in severe 
cases  of  Plasmodium  falciparum  malaria.  The  jaundice  in  these 
cases is due to a combination of indirect hyperbilirubinemia from 
hemolysis and both cholestatic and hepatocellular jaundice. Weil’s 
disease, a severe presentation of leptospirosis, is marked by jaundice 
with renal failure, fever, headache, and muscle pain.

Causes  of  extrahepatic  cholestasis  can  be  split  into  malignant 
and  benign  (Table  49-3).  Malignant  causes  include  pancreatic, 
gallbladder, and ampullary cancers as well as cholangiocarcinoma. 
This last malignancy is most commonly associated with PSC and is 
exceptionally  difficult  to  diagnose  because  its  appearance  is  often 
identical to that of PSC. Pancreatic and gallbladder tumors as well as 
cholangiocarcinoma are rarely resectable and have poor prognoses. 
Ampullary  carcinoma  has  the  highest  surgical  cure  rate  of  all  the 
tumors  that  present  as  painless  jaundice.  Hilar  lymphadenopathy 
due to metastases from other cancers may cause obstruction of the 
extrahepatic biliary tree.

Choledocholithiasis  is  the  most  common  cause  of  extrahepatic 
cholestasis.  The  clinical  presentation  can  range  from  mild  right- 
upper-quadrant discomfort with only minimal elevations of enzyme 
test values to ascending cholangitis with jaundice, sepsis, and circu-
latory collapse. PSC may occur with clinically important strictures 
limited to the extrahepatic biliary tree. IgG4-associated cholangitis 
is  marked  by  stricturing  of  the  biliary  tree.  It  is  critical  that  the 
clinician  differentiate  this  condition  from  PSC  as  it  is  responsive 
to  glucocorticoid  therapy.  In  rare  instances,  chronic  pancreatitis 
causes  strictures  of  the  distal  common  bile  duct,  where  it  passes 
through the head of the pancreas. AIDS cholangiopathy is a con-
dition  that  is  usually  due  to  infection  of  the  bile  duct  epithelium 
with  CMV  or  cryptosporidia  and  has  a  cholangiographic  appear-
ance  similar  to  that  of  PSC.  The  affected  patients  usually  present 
with  greatly  elevated  serum  alkaline  phosphatase  levels  (mean,  
800  IU/L),  but  the  bilirubin  level  is  often  near  normal.  These 
patients do not typically present with jaundice.

by episodic attacks of pruritus, cholestasis, and jaundice beginning 
at any age, which can be debilitating but does not lead to chronic 
liver  disease.  Serum  bile  acids  are  elevated  during  episodes,  but 
serum  γ-glutamyltransferase  (γ-GT)  activity  is  normal.  PFIC  dis-
orders begin at childhood and are progressive in nature. All three 
types of PFIC are associated with progressive cholestasis, elevated 
levels  of  serum  bile  acids,  and  similar  phenotypes  but  different 
genetic mutations. Only type 3 PFIC is associated with high levels 
of  γ-GT.  Cholestasis  of  pregnancy  occurs  in  the  second  and  third 
trimesters and resolves after delivery. Its cause is unknown, but the 

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
While extrahepatic biliary obstruction and drugs are common causes 
of  new-onset  jaundice  in  developed  countries,  infections  remain  the 
leading cause in developing countries. Liver involvement and jaundice 
are observed with numerous infections, particularly malaria, babesio-
sis, severe leptospirosis, infections due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
and the Mycobacterium avium complex, typhoid fever, infection with 
hepatitis viruses A–E, EBV, CMV, viral hemorrhagic fevers including 
Ebola virus, late phases of yellow fever, dengue fever, schistosomiasis, 
fascioliasis,  clonorchiasis,  opisthorchiasis,  ascariasis,  echinococcosis, 
hepatosplenic  candidiasis,  disseminated  histoplasmosis,  cryptococ-
cosis,  coccidioimycosis,  ehrlichiosis,  chronic  Q  fever,  yersiniosis,

essarily involve the liver and bile ducts may also lead to jaundice, as in 
cholestasis of sepsis. The presence of fever or abdominal pain suggests 
concurrent  infection,  sepsis,  or  complications  from  gallstones.  The 
development  of  encephalopathy  and  coagulopathy  in  a  jaundiced 
patient  with  no  preexisting  liver  disease  signifies  acute  liver  failure, 
which warrants urgent liver transplant evaluation.

50 Abdominal Swelling  
and Ascites
Lawrence S. Friedman

ABDOMINAL SWELLING
Abdominal swelling is a manifestation of numerous diseases. Patients 
may complain of bloating or abdominal fullness and may note increas-
ing  abdominal  girth  on  the  basis  of  increased  clothing  or  belt  size. 
Abdominal  discomfort  is  often  reported,  but  pain  is  less  frequent. 
When  abdominal  pain  does  accompany  swelling,  it  is  frequently  the 
result  of  an  intraabdominal  infection,  peritonitis,  or  pancreatitis. 
Patients with abdominal distention from ascites (fluid in the abdomen) 
may report the new onset of an inguinal or umbilical hernia. Dyspnea 
may  result  from  pressure  against  the  diaphragm  and  the  inability  to 
expand the lungs fully.
 ■ CAUSES
The  causes  of  abdominal  swelling  can  be  remembered  conveniently 
as the six Fs: flatus, fat, fluid, fetus, feces, or a “fatal growth” (often a 
neoplasm).

Flatus  Abdominal  swelling  may  be  the  result  of  increased  intes-
tinal  gas.  The  normal  small  intestine  contains  ~200  mL  of  gas  made 
up  of  nitrogen,  oxygen,  carbon  dioxide,  hydrogen,  and  methane. 
Nitrogen  and  oxygen  are  consumed  (swallowed),  whereas  carbon 
dioxide, hydrogen, and methane are produced intraluminally by bac-
terial fermentation. Increased intestinal gas can occur in a number of 
conditions. Aerophagia, the swallowing of air, can result in increased 
amounts  of  oxygen  and  nitrogen  in  the  small  intestine  and  lead  to 
abdominal  swelling.  Aerophagia  typically  results  from  gulping  food; 
chewing gum; smoking; or as a response to anxiety, which can lead to 
repetitive belching. In some cases, increased intestinal gas is the conse-
quence of bacterial metabolism of excess fermentable substances such 
as  lactose  and  other  oligosaccharides,  which  can  lead  to  production 
of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, or methane. In many cases, the precise 
cause  of  abdominal  distention  cannot  be  determined.  In  some  per-
sons,  particularly  those  with  irritable  bowel  syndrome  and  bloating, 
the subjective sense of abdominal pressure is attributable to impaired 
intestinal transit of gas rather than increased gas volume. Abdominal 
distention—an  objective  increase  in  girth—is  the  result  of  a  lack  of 

coordination between diaphragmatic contraction and anterior abdom-
inal  wall  relaxation,  a  response  in  some  cases  to  intraluminal  bowel 
stimuli; dietary alterations, manipulation of the intestinal microbiota, 
or biofeedback may be effective therapy. Occasionally, increased lum-
bar lordosis accounts for apparent abdominal distention.

321

Fat  Weight gain with an increase in abdominal fat can result in an 
increase in abdominal girth and can be perceived as abdominal swell-
ing.  Abdominal  fat  may  be  caused  by  an  imbalance  between  caloric 
intake and energy expenditure associated with a poor diet and seden-
tary lifestyle; it also can be a manifestation of certain diseases, such as 
Cushing’s syndrome. Excess abdominal fat has been associated with an 
increased risk of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease.

Fluid  The  accumulation  of  fluid  within  the  abdominal  cavity 
(ascites) often results in abdominal distention and is discussed in detail 
below. Grade 1 ascites is detectable only by ultrasonography; grade 2 
ascites is detectable by physical examination; and grade 3 ascites results 
in marked abdominal distention.

Fetus  Pregnancy results in increased abdominal girth. Typically, an 
increase in abdominal size is first noted at 12–14 weeks of gestation, 
when the uterus moves from the pelvis into the abdomen. Abdominal 
distention may be seen before this point as a result of fluid retention 
and relaxation of the abdominal muscles.

Feces 
In the setting of severe constipation or intestinal obstruction, 
increased stool in the colon leads to increased abdominal girth. These 
conditions  are  often  accompanied  by  abdominal  discomfort  or  pain, 
nausea, and vomiting and can be diagnosed by imaging studies.

Fatal Growth  An abdominal mass can result in abdominal swell-
ing.  Neoplasms,  abscesses,  or  cysts  can  grow  to  sizes  that  lead  to 
increased abdominal girth. Enlargement of the intraabdominal organs, 
specifically  the  liver  (hepatomegaly)  or  spleen  (splenomegaly),  or  an 
abdominal aortic aneurysm can result in abdominal distention. Blad-
der distention also may result in abdominal swelling.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Abdominal Swelling 

HISTORY
Determining  the  etiology  of  abdominal  swelling  begins  with   
history-taking and a physical examination. Patients should be ques-
tioned  regarding  symptoms  suggestive  of  malignancy,  including 
weight  loss,  night  sweats,  and  anorexia.  Inability  to  pass  stool  or 
flatus together with nausea or vomiting suggests bowel obstruction, 
severe constipation, or an ileus (lack of peristalsis). Increased eruc-
tation and flatus may point toward aerophagia or increased intes-
tinal  production  of  gas.  Patients  should  be  questioned  about  risk 
factors for or symptoms of chronic liver disease, including excessive 
alcohol use and jaundice, which suggest ascites. Patients should also 
be  asked  about  symptoms  of  other  medical  conditions,  including 
heart failure and tuberculosis, which may cause ascites. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Physical examination should include an assessment for signs of sys-
temic disease. The presence of lymphadenopathy, especially supra-
clavicular  lymphadenopathy  (Virchow’s  node),  suggests  metastatic 
abdominal  malignancy.  Care  should  be  taken  during  the  cardiac 
examination  to  evaluate  for  elevation  of  jugular  venous  pressure 
(JVP); Kussmaul’s sign (elevation of the JVP during inspiration); a 
pericardial knock, which may be seen in heart failure or constric-
tive  pericarditis;  or  a  murmur  of  tricuspid  regurgitation.  Spider 
angiomas,  palmar  erythema,  dilated  superficial  veins  around  the 
umbilicus (caput medusae), and gynecomastia suggest liver disease.
The  abdominal  examination  should  begin  with  inspection  for 
the  presence  of  uneven  distention  or  an  obvious  mass.  Ausculta-
tion  should  follow.  The  absence  of  bowel  sounds  or  the  presence

322

of  high-pitched  localized  bowel  sounds  points  toward  an  ileus 
or  intestinal  obstruction.  An  umbilical  venous  hum  may  suggest 
the  presence  of  portal  hypertension,  and  a  harsh  bruit  over  the 
liver  is  heard  rarely  in  patients  with  hepatocellular  carcinoma  or 
alcohol-associated  hepatitis.  Abdominal  swelling  caused  by  intes-
tinal  gas  can  be  differentiated  from  swelling  caused  by  fluid  or  a 
solid mass by percussion; an abdomen filled with gas is tympanic, 
whereas an abdomen containing a mass or fluid is dull to percus-
sion. The absence of abdominal dullness, however, does not exclude 
ascites, because a minimum of 1500 mL of ascitic fluid is required 
for detection on physical examination. Finally, the abdomen should 
be  palpated  to  assess  for  tenderness,  a  mass,  enlargement  of  the 
spleen or liver, or presence of a nodular liver suggesting cirrhosis or 
tumor. Light palpation of the liver may detect pulsations suggesting 
retrograde vascular flow from the heart in patients with right-sided 
heart failure, particularly tricuspid regurgitation.

 ■ IMAGING AND LABORATORY EVALUATION
Abdominal  x-rays  can  be  used  to  detect  dilated  loops  of  bowel  sug-
gesting  intestinal  obstruction  or  ileus.  Abdominal  ultrasonography 
can  detect  as  little  as  100  mL  of  ascitic  fluid,  hepatosplenomegaly,  a 
nodular liver, or a mass. Ultrasonography is often inadequate to detect 
retroperitoneal  lymphadenopathy  or  a  pancreatic  lesion  because  of 
overlying bowel gas. If malignancy or pancreatic disease is suspected, 
CT  can  be  performed.  CT  may  also  detect  changes  associated  with 
advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension (Fig. 50-1).

Laboratory  evaluation  should  include  liver  biochemical  testing, 
serum albumin level measurement, and prothrombin time determina-
tion (international normalized ratio) to assess hepatic function as well 
as a complete blood count to evaluate for the presence of cytopenias 
that  may  result  from  portal  hypertension  or  of  leukocytosis,  anemia, 
and  thrombocytosis  that  may  result  from  systemic  infection.  Serum 
amylase  and  lipase  levels  should  be  checked  to  evaluate  the  patient 
for acute pancreatitis. Urinary protein quantitation is indicated when 
nephrotic syndrome, which may cause ascites, is suspected. Hydrogen 
and  methane  absorbed  from  the  intestine  are  not  metabolized  by 
the  host  and  are  excreted  in  expired  air,  and  detection  of  increased 
amounts of these gases in expired breath is the basis for tests used to 

diagnose carbohydrate (e.g., lactose) malabsorption and small intesti-
nal bacterial overgrowth.

In  selected  cases,  the  hepatic  venous  pressure  gradient  (pressure 
across the liver between the portal and hepatic veins) can be measured 
via cannulation of the hepatic vein to confirm that ascites is caused by 
cirrhosis (Chap. 344). In some cases, a liver biopsy may be necessary 
to confirm cirrhosis.

ASCITES
 ■ PATHOGENESIS IN THE PRESENCE OF CIRRHOSIS
Ascites  in  patients  with  cirrhosis  is  the  result  of  portal  hypertension 
and renal salt and water retention. Similar mechanisms contribute to 
ascites formation in heart failure. Portal hypertension signifies eleva-
tion  of  the  pressure  within  the  portal  vein.  According  to  Ohm’s  law, 
pressure is the product of resistance and flow. Increased hepatic resis-
tance occurs by several mechanisms. First, the development of hepatic 
fibrosis,  which  defines  cirrhosis,  disrupts  the  normal  architecture  of 
the hepatic sinusoids and impedes normal blood flow through the liver. 
Second, activation of hepatic stellate cells, which mediate fibrogenesis, 
leads  to  smooth-muscle  contraction  and  fibrosis.  Finally,  cirrhosis 
is  associated  with  a  decrease  in  endothelial  nitric  oxide  synthetase 
(eNOS) production, which results in decreased nitric oxide production 
and increased intrahepatic vasoconstriction.

The  development  of  cirrhosis  is  also  associated  with  increased 
systemic circulating levels of nitric oxide (in contrast to the decrease 
seen intrahepatically), as well as increased levels of vascular endothe-
lial growth factor and tumor necrosis factor, that result in splanchnic 
arterial vasodilation. Vasodilation of the splanchnic circulation results 
in pooling of blood and a decrease in the effective circulating volume, 
which  is  perceived  by  the  kidneys  as  hypovolemia.  Compensatory 
vasoconstriction via release of antidiuretic hormone ensues; the con-
sequences  are  free  water  retention  and  activation  of  the  sympathetic 
nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which 
lead in turn to renal sodium and water retention.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS IN THE ABSENCE OF CIRRHOSIS
Ascites  in  the  absence  of  cirrhosis  generally  results  from  peritoneal 
carcinomatosis, peritoneal infection, or pancreatic disease. Peritoneal 
carcinomatosis can result from primary peritoneal malignancies such 
as  mesothelioma  or  sarcoma,  abdominal  malignancies  such  as  gas-
tric  or  colonic  adenocarcinoma,  or  metastatic  disease  from  breast  or 
lung carcinoma or melanoma (Fig. 50-2). The tumor cells lining the

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesperitoneum produce a protein-rich fluid that contributes to the devel-
opment of ascites. Fluid from the extracellular space is drawn into the 
peritoneum, further contributing to the development of ascites. Tuber-
culous  peritonitis  causes  ascites  via  a  similar  mechanism;  tubercles 
deposited on the peritoneum exude a proteinaceous fluid. Pancreatic 
ascites results from leakage of pancreatic enzymes into the peritoneum.
 ■ CAUSES
Cirrhosis accounts for 84% of cases of ascites. Cardiac ascites, perito-
neal carcinomatosis, and “mixed” ascites resulting from cirrhosis and 
a  second  disease  account  for  10–15%  of  cases.  Less  common  causes 
of  ascites  include  massive  hepatic  metastasis,  infection  (tuberculosis, 
Chlamydia  infection),  pancreatitis,  and  renal  disease  (nephrotic  syn-
drome).  Rare  causes  of  ascites  include  hypothyroidism  and  familial 
Mediterranean fever.
 ■ EVALUATION
Once the presence of ascites has been confirmed, the etiology of the 
ascites is best determined by paracentesis, a bedside procedure in which 
a needle or small catheter is passed transcutaneously to extract ascitic 
fluid from the peritoneum. The lower quadrants are the most frequent 
sites for paracentesis. The left lower quadrant is preferred because of 
the greater depth of ascites and the thinner abdominal wall. Paracen-
tesis is a safe procedure even in patients with coagulopathy; complica-
tions, including abdominal wall hematomas, hypotension, hepatorenal 
syndrome, and infection, are infrequent.

Once  ascitic  fluid  has  been  extracted,  its  gross  appearance  should 
be examined. Turbid fluid can result from the presence of infection or 
tumor cells. White, milky fluid indicates a triglyceride level >200 mg/
dL (and often >1000 mg/dL), which is the hallmark of chylous ascites. 
Chylous ascites results from lymphatic disruption that may occur with 
trauma,  cirrhosis,  tumor,  tuberculosis,  or  certain  congenital  abnor-
malities.  Dark  brown  fluid  can  reflect  a  high  bilirubin  concentration 
and  indicates  biliary  tract  perforation.  Black  fluid  may  indicate  the 
presence of pancreatic necrosis or metastatic melanoma.

The  ascitic  fluid  should  be  sent  for  measurement  of  albumin  and 
total protein levels, cell and differential counts, and, if infection is sus-
pected, Gram’s stain and culture, with inoculation into blood culture 
bottles at the patient’s bedside to maximize the yield. A serum albumin 
level should be measured simultaneously to permit calculation of the 
serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG).

The  SAAG  is  useful  for  distinguishing  ascites  caused  by  portal 
hypertension  from  nonportal  hypertensive  ascites  (Fig.  50-3).  The 
SAAG reflects the pressure within the hepatic sinusoids and correlates 
with the hepatic venous pressure gradient. The SAAG is calculated by 
subtracting the ascitic albumin concentration from the serum albumin 
level and does not change with diuresis. A SAAG ≥1.1 g/dL reflects the 
presence  of  portal  hypertension  and  indicates  that  the  ascites  is  due 
to increased pressure in the hepatic sinusoids. According to Starling’s 
law,  a  high  SAAG  reflects  the  oncotic  pressure  that  counterbalances 
the  portal  pressure.  Possible  causes  include  cirrhosis,  cardiac  ascites,

hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome), sinusoidal obstruc-
tion  syndrome  (veno-occlusive  disease),  or  massive  liver  metastases. 
A  SAAG  <1.1  g/dL  indicates  that  the  ascites  is  not  related  to  portal 
hypertension, as in tuberculous peritonitis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, 
or pancreatic ascites.

For high-SAAG (≥1.1) ascites, the ascitic protein level can provide 
further  clues  to  the  etiology  (Fig.  50-3).  An  ascitic  protein  level  of  
≥2.5 g/dL indicates that the hepatic sinusoids are normal and are allow-
ing passage of protein into the ascites, as occurs in cardiac ascites, early 
Budd-Chiari syndrome, or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. An ascitic 
protein level <2.5 g/dL indicates that the hepatic sinusoids have been 
damaged and scarred and no longer allow passage of protein, as occurs 
with cirrhosis, late Budd-Chiari syndrome, or massive liver metastases. 
Pro-brain-type  natriuretic  peptide  (BNP)  is  a  natriuretic  hormone 
released  by  the  heart  as  a  result  of  increased  volume  and  ventricular 
wall stretch. High levels of BNP in serum occur in heart failure and may 
be useful in identifying heart failure as the cause of high-SAAG ascites.
Further  tests  are  indicated  only  in  specific  clinical  circumstances. 
When secondary peritonitis resulting from a perforated hollow viscus 
is  suspected,  ascitic  glucose  and  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  levels 
can  be  measured.  In  contrast  to  “spontaneous”  bacterial  peritonitis, 
which  may  complicate  cirrhotic  ascites  (see  “Complications,”  below), 
secondary peritonitis is suggested by an ascitic glucose level <50 mg/
dL,  an  ascitic  LDH  level  higher  than  the  serum  LDH  level,  and  the 
detection of multiple pathogens on ascitic fluid culture. When pancre-
atic ascites is suspected, the ascitic amylase level should be measured 
and is typically >1000 mg/dL. Cytology can be useful in the diagnosis 
of peritoneal carcinomatosis. At least 50 mL of fluid should be obtained 
and sent for immediate processing. Tuberculous peritonitis is typically 
associated  with  ascitic  fluid  lymphocytosis  but  can  be  difficult  to 
diagnose by paracentesis. A smear for acid-fast bacilli has a diagnostic 
sensitivity of only 0–3%; a culture increases the sensitivity to 35–50%. 
In patients without cirrhosis, an elevated ascitic adenosine deaminase 
level has a sensitivity of >90% for tuberculous ascites when a cut-off 
value of 30–45 U/L is used. When the cause of ascites remains uncer-
tain, laparotomy or laparoscopy with peritoneal biopsies for histology 
and culture remains the gold standard.

TREATMENT
Ascites

The  initial  treatment  for  cirrhotic  ascites  is  restriction  of  sodium 
intake  to  2  g/d.  When  sodium  restriction  alone  is  inadequate 
to  control  ascites,  oral  diuretics—typically  the  combination  of 
spironolactone  and  furosemide—are  used  to  increase  urinary 
sodium excretion. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist that 
inhibits  sodium  resorption  in  the  distal  convoluted  tubule  of  the 
kidney.  Use  of  spironolactone  may  be  limited  by  hyponatremia, 
hyperkalemia,  and  painful  gynecomastia.  If  the  gynecomastia  is

distressing, amiloride (5–40 mg/d) may be substituted for spirono-
lactone.  Furosemide  is  a  loop  diuretic  that  is  generally  combined 
with  spironolactone  in  a  ratio  of  40:100;  maximal  daily  doses  of 
spironolactone  and  furosemide  are  400  mg  and  160  mg,  respec-
tively. Fluid intake may be restricted in patients with hyponatremia.
Refractory cirrhotic ascites is defined by the persistence of ascites 
despite  sodium  restriction  and  maximal  (or  maximally  tolerated) 
diuretic use. Pharmacologic therapy for refractory ascites includes 
the addition of midodrine, an α1-adrenergic agonist, or clonidine, 
an  α2-adrenergic  agonist,  to  diuretic  therapy.  These  agents  act  as 
vasoconstrictors, counteracting splanchnic vasodilation. Midodrine 
alone or in combination with clonidine improves systemic hemo-
dynamics  and  control  of  ascites  over  that  obtained  with  diuretics 
alone.  Although  β-adrenergic  blocking  agents  (beta  blockers)  are 
often  prescribed  to  prevent  variceal  hemorrhage  in  patients  with 
cirrhosis, the use of beta blockers in patients with refractory ascites 
may be associated with decreased survival rates.

When medical therapy alone is insufficient, refractory cirrhotic 
ascites  can  be  managed  by  repeated  large-volume  paracentesis 
(LVP)  or  a  transjugular  intrahepatic  peritoneal  shunt  (TIPS)—a 
radiologically  placed  portosystemic  shunt  that  decompresses  the 
hepatic  sinusoids.  Intravenous  (IV)  infusion  of  albumin  accom-
panying  LVP  decreases  the  risk  of  “postparacentesis  circulatory 
dysfunction” and death. Patients undergoing LVP should receive IV 
albumin infusions of 6–8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed. TIPS place-
ment is superior to LVP in reducing the reaccumulation of ascites 
but is associated with an increased frequency of hepatic encephal-
opathy, with no difference in mortality rates. The Alfapump system, 
which consists of an automated pump and tunneled peritoneal cath-
eter that transports ascites from the peritoneal cavity to the urinary 
bladder, has shown promise in the management of refractory ascites 
but  is  associated  with  a  higher  frequency  of  technical  difficulties 
and renal dysfunction.

Malignant  ascites  does  not  respond  to  sodium  restriction  or 
diuretics. Patients must undergo serial LVPs, transcutaneous drain-
age  catheter  placement,  or,  rarely,  creation  of  a  peritoneovenous 
shunt  (a  shunt  from  the  abdominal  cavity  to  the  vena  cava)  or 
placement of the Alfapump system, if available.

Ascites caused by tuberculous peritonitis is treated with standard 
antituberculosis  therapy.  Noncirrhotic  ascites  of  other  causes  is 
treated by correction of the precipitating condition.

 ■ COMPLICATIONS
Spontaneous  bacterial  peritonitis  (SBP;  Chap.  132)  is  a  common  and 
potentially  lethal  complication  of  cirrhotic  ascites.  Occasionally,  SBP 
also complicates ascites caused by nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, 
acute hepatitis, and acute liver failure but is rare in malignant ascites. 
Patients  with  SBP  generally  note  an  increase  in  abdominal  girth; 
however, abdominal tenderness is found in only 40% of patients, and 
rebound  tenderness  is  uncommon.  Patients  may  present  with  fever, 
nausea, vomiting, or the new onset or an exacerbation of preexisting 
hepatic encephalopathy.

In  hospitalized  patients  with  ascites,  paracentesis  within  12  hours 
of admission reduces mortality because of early detection of SBP. SBP 
is defined by a polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) count of ≥250/
μL  in  the  ascitic  fluid.  Cultures  of  ascitic  fluid  should  be  performed 
in  blood  culture  bottles  and  typically  reveal  one  bacterial  pathogen. 
The presence of multiple pathogens in the setting of an elevated ascitic 
PMN  count  suggests  secondary  peritonitis  from  a  ruptured  viscus  or 
abscess (Chap. 132). The presence of multiple pathogens without an 
elevated PMN count suggests bowel perforation from the paracentesis 
needle. SBP is generally the result of enteric bacteria that have translo-
cated across an edematous bowel wall. The most common pathogens 
are gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, as well 
as streptococci and enterococci.

Treatment of SBP with an antibiotic such as IV cefotaxime is gen-
erally  effective  against  gram-negative  and  gram-positive  aerobes.  A 

5-day course of treatment is sufficient if the patient improves clinically. 
Nosocomial or health care–acquired SBP is frequently caused by multi-
drug-resistant bacteria, and initial antibiotic therapy should be guided 
by the local bacterial epidemiology.

Cirrhotic  patients  with  a  history  of  SBP,  an  ascitic  fluid  total  pro-
tein concentration <1 g/dL, or active gastrointestinal bleeding should 
receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent SBP; oral daily ciprofloxacin 
or, where available, norfloxacin is commonly used. IV ceftriaxone may 
be used in hospitalized patients. Diuresis increases the activity of ascitic 
fluid protein opsonins and may decrease the risk of SBP.

Hepatic hydrothorax occurs when ascites, often caused by cirrhosis, 
migrates  via  fenestrae  in  the  diaphragm  into  the  pleural  space.  This 
condition  can  result  in  shortness  of  breath,  hypoxia,  and  infection. 
Treatment is similar to that for cirrhotic ascites and includes sodium 
restriction, diuretics, and, if needed, thoracentesis or TIPS placement. 
Chest tube placement should be avoided.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesSection 7  Alterations in Renal and 
Urinary Tract Function

51 Interstitial  
Cystitis/Bladder Pain 
Syndrome
R. Christopher Doiron, J. Curtis Nickel

DEFINITION
A condition associated with bladder inflammation and pain, with what 
were thought to be discrete bladder ulcerations, was first described in 
1887. The description of the classic bladder-wall ulcer—now referred 
to as a Hunner lesion—became known as interstitial cystitis (IC). The 
first generally accepted definition of IC was derived from a National 
Institute  for  Diabetes  and  Digestive  and  Kidney  Diseases  (NIDDK) 
consensus of experts in the field in 1998. The NIDDK criteria used to 
define IC included typical cystoscopic findings such as glomerulations 
(submucosal  petechial  hemorrhages  of  the  urothelium)  or  Hunner 
lesions.  However,  over  time,  the  syndrome  experienced  by  patients, 
including  bladder  and/or  pelvic  pain  with  associated  urinary  storage 
symptoms of urinary frequency and urgency, negative urine cultures, 
and no specific identifiable causes, became known as interstitial cystitis/
bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS).

The  nomenclature  and  definitions  have  evolved,  but  the  contem-
porary  definitions  accepted  by  the  American  Urological  Association, 
the  Canadian  Urological  Association,  the  International  Continence 
Society,  the  Society  for  Urodynamics  and  Female  Urology,  and  the 
European  Society  for  the  Study  of  IC/BPS,  although  they  all  differ 
somewhat  in  language  and  specifics,  generally  reflect  several  funda-
mental concepts common in the disease: (1) it is chronic in nature; (2) 
it causes pain perceived to be attributable to the bladder; (3) this pain 
occurs in the presence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS); and 
(4) pain outside the bladder—in the pelvis, perineum, genitals, abdo-
men, and beyond—is common.

The  following  definition  incorporates  the  major  descriptions  by 
all international groups interested in the diagnosis and management 
of IC/BPS: an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) per-
ceived  to  be  related  to  the  urinary  bladder,  associated  with  LUTS  of 
>6  weeks’  duration,  in  the  absence  of  infection  or  other  identifiable 
causes.

A  generalized  urologic  chronic  pelvic  pain  syndrome  (UCPPS)  is 
referenced in the literature and is thought to encompass two distinct 
urologic chronic pain disorders: IC/BPS, which may be present in men 
and  women,  and  chronic  prostatitis/chronic  pelvic  pain  syndrome 
(CP/CPPS), which is present only in men. The latter refers to a uro-
logic pain disorder with pain localized to the perineum and/or male 
genitals, with or without LUTS. IC/BPS can exist independent of CP/
CPPS in men. In reality, the urologic chronic pain disorders often have 
overlapping symptom presentations and may share common etiologic 
and pathophysiologic origins, but the focus of the current chapter will 
be on IC/BPS.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
Pinning a single etiology to a diagnosis of IC/BPS has been an endeavor 
fraught with uncertainty that ultimately has failed thus far. Instead, it 
is much more likely and widely accepted that IC/BPS represents a syn-
drome or constellation of interrelated disease processes that manifest 
in  a  spectrum  of  disease  that  reaches  beyond  the  bladder.  While  the 
search for a single etiology soldiers on, we will review here a collection 
of proposed theories.

 ■ INFECTION AND THE URINARY MICROBIOTA
Bacterial infection of the urothelium has long been regarded as a major 
suspect in the etiology of IC/BPS but has never been definitively shown 
to cause the disease. It is not uncommon for patients presenting with 
IC/BPS to describe a long history of “urinary tract infections” (UTIs); 
these  patients  often  have  undergone  multiple  courses  of  treatment 
with one or multiple antibiotics prescribed by their physicians. Often, 
however, in patients with IC/BPS, the benefit of antibiotic treatment is 
short-lived, urine culture results are negative, and the return of symp-
toms is inevitable.

Although studies examining the role of microbiologic organisms in 
this  patient  population  are  numerous  and  the  results  conflicting,  far 
more studies have yielded negative results rather than positive findings. 
Furthermore, our understanding of the urinary microbiota continues 
to expand, rendering older studies using outdated and insensitive cul-
tivation techniques less relevant.

Using state-of-the-art, culture-independent techniques for microor-
ganism identification, investigators observe subtle differences between 
the urinary microbiota of IC/BPS patients and that of healthy controls 
and  between  IC/BPS  patients  experiencing  symptom  flares  and  IC/
BPS patients not in flare. The clinical relevance of these findings is still 
not fully understood. As the study of the urinary microbiota continues 
to  unfold,  researchers  and  clinicians  believe  that  although  a  single 
causative microbe is unlikely, dysbiosis or disturbance in the microbial 
ecology  of  the  lower  urinary  tract  may  be  responsible  for  flares  or 
symptom patterns experienced by IC/BPS patients.

 ■ AUTOIMMUNITY
The  consideration  of  IC/BPS  as  a  disorder  of  the  immune  system 
stems from the observation of a significant prevalence of autoimmune 
disorders  in  IC/BPS  patients;  several  historical  studies  have  identi-
fied  anti-urothelial  antibodies  within  the  bladder  mucosa  of  IC/BPS 
patients. Furthermore, although IC/BPS is not a pathologic diagnosis, 
there  are  widely  accepted,  recognizable  patterns  of  inflammatory 
infiltration in the bladder mucosa of this patient population, including 
lymphoplasmacytic  infiltrates,  stromal  edema  and  fibrosis,  urothelial 
denudation, and detrusor mastocytosis. Thus, although it is likely that 
immune disturbances cause the condition in a subset of patients (for 
example,  in  those  with  associated  Sjögren’s  syndrome),  researchers 
and clinicians have been unable to leverage this knowledge into a clear 
description, and its clinical relevance is not fully understood.

 ■ INFLAMMATION
It  is  well  established  that  a  subset  of  patients  suffering  from  IC/BPS 
clearly  have  associated  bladder  inflammation  of  unknown  etiology. 
The best described of these patients are those with Hunner lesions—
discrete  inflammatory  lesions,  previously  believed  to  be  ulcers,  that 
have  a  well-characterized  inflammatory  profile  on  histologic  and 
pathologic analysis. While Hunner lesions are easily identified under 
direct vision by cystoscopy, a spectrum of other, less obvious inflam-
matory patterns in the bladder is associated with infiltration of acute 
and  chronic  inflammatory  cells  and  mast  cells.  This  inflammation 
observed on histologic analysis can be so subtle that it cannot be recog-
nized under direct visual examination of the bladder with cystoscopy.
Investigators  in  the  Multidisciplinary  Approach  to  the  Study  of 
Chronic  Pelvic  Pain  (MAPP)  Research  Network  have  found  that, 
among patients with UCPPS, women exhibit more robust inflammatory 
responses to stimulation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4. Fur-
thermore, an increased response to stimulation of TLR4 predicts more 
severe symptoms, widespread pain (vs pelvic/bladder pain only), and a 
higher number of chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs). Further 
studies aimed at a better understanding of these findings are under way.

 ■ UROTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION
Urothelial  Permeability  and 
the  Glycosaminoglycan 
Layer  The stratified epithelium of the bladder—the urothelium—is 
composed  of  basal  precursor  cells,  intermediate  cells,  and  a  layer  of 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   325

21/01/22   3:38 PM

 
 
 
 
 
326

specialized, superficial epithelial cells called umbrella cells. Collectively, 
these  layers  are  responsible  for  the  various  functions  of  the  bladder 
lining.  One  important  function  of  the  urothelium  is  to  provide  a 
robust barrier layer. This function is fulfilled by the dense layering of 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the luminal surface of the urothelium 
along  with  a  complex  arrangement  of  numerous  intercellular  tight 
junctions among urothelial cells that protects the underlying bladder 
interstitium from the constituents of the urine resting in the bladder.

Defects in this barrier function—either disruptions in the GAG layer 
or disruptions in the epithelial layer itself or its cellular junctions—have 
been  proposed  as  a  possible  mechanism  for  bladder  pain  in  IC/BPS 
patients. This theory, while still popular, lacks definitive evidence sup-
porting it as the etiology of this disease.

Antiproliferative Factor  The discovery that urothelial cells from 
IC/BPS  patients  appear  to  grow  far  more  slowly  than  urothelial  cells 
from  a  healthy  control  population  led  to  the  identification  of  anti-
proliferative  factor  (APF).  Although  APF  initially  showed  promise 
as  a  sensitive  and  specific  urine  biomarker  for  IC/BPS,  this  idea  has 
not been widely adopted, and the etiologic role of APF is not yet fully 
understood.
 ■ PELVIC ORGAN CROSSTALK
The  observation  of  dysfunction  and  symptoms  in  multiple  organ 
systems,  including  gastrointestinal,  gynecologic,  and  genital  organs, 
in patients with IC/BPS is so common that it might be considered the 
norm.  Mechanisms  of  neural  sensitization  in  patients  with  chronic 
pain have been reported, and abnormalities in the autonomic nervous 
system  have  been  observed  among  IC/BPS  patients.  Again,  although 
these observations apply in a subset of patients, their broader applica-
tion to the heterogeneous IC/BPS patient population as a clear cause of 
disease is not warranted.
 ■ NEUROBIOLOGIC CONTRIBUTIONS AND 
CENTRAL SENSITIZATION
One breakthrough by the MAPP Research Network is an investigation 
of  the  role  of  structural  and  functional  alterations  in  the  brains  of 
patients with UCPPS. The network’s innovative methods of correlating 
clinical and deep phenotyping data with functional MRI data identi-
fied such structural and functional differences. These differences were 
later shown to successfully predict the progression of symptoms in a 
cohort of 52 patients with UCPPS. Although the relevant study did not 
differentiate between IC/BPS and CP/CPPS patients, the findings are 
nevertheless informative, and further longitudinal studies are ongoing.
In  addition  to  the  novel  MAPP-led  findings  using  neuroimaging, 
quantitative sensory testing (QST) methods have been used to inves-
tigate  the  sensory  processing  mechanisms  in  UCPPS  patients.  The 
findings—generalized  pain  hypersensitivity  and  altered  endogenous 
inhibitory  pain  control  systems  among  UCPPS  patients—further 
support a hypothesis of a central sensitization phenotype in urologic 
chronic pelvic pain. The clinical implications of observed neural altera-
tions and multisensory hypersensitivity remain under investigation.

Although  a  single  etiology  for  this  clinically  heterogeneous  pain 
syndrome may never be identified, efforts to do so have revealed much 
about its pathogenesis in subsets of patients and have provided valuable 
insight into specific patient phenotypes. The challenge for researchers 
and clinicians moving forward will be to unify clinical phenotypes with 
these proposed underlying mechanisms of disease and to integrate this 
knowledge  into  clinically  actionable  interventions  that  may  provide 
meaningful outcomes.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
The prevalence of IC/BPS has been difficult to determine because defi-
nitions and diagnostic criteria (in the absence of a definitive diagnostic 
test  or  biomarker)  are  constantly  evolving.  In  addition,  the  various 
methods  used  in  attempting  to  describe  the  syndrome’s  epidemiol-
ogy  (patient  self-reports,  symptom-based  surveys,  physician  visits, 
population-based  databases)  have  been  problematic  and  have  made 
comparisons of results challenging. Many studies have historically been 
performed  only  in  female  populations.  Currently,  it  is  estimated  that 

2.7–6.5% of North American women experience symptoms consistent 
with a diagnosis of IC/BPS. Fewer than 10% of women who experience 
these  symptoms  actually  have  a  diagnosis  of  IC/BPS.  The  syndrome 
does occur in men, with a reported 10:1 female-to-male ratio, but it is 
thought that the condition is dramatically underreported in men.

Some predictors of the development of IC/BPS have been suggested 
through an analysis of retrospective observational studies of childhood 
disorders and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), including child-
hood UTI, childhood bowel and bladder dysfunction, and childhood 
sexual trauma. Furthermore, it has been well established that IC/BPS 
patients  exhibit  a  remarkable  prevalence  of  COPCs  such  as  fibromy-
algia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic back pain, and chronic 
fatigue  syndrome  (CFS).  Recent  MAPP-led  studies  have  shown  that 
more than one-third of IC/BPS patients have one COPC (IBS, fibromy-
algia,  or  CFS),  while  up  to  10%  have  multiple  COPCs.  Thus,  these 
conditions  might  be  considered  risk  factors  for  the  development  of  
IC/BPS.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Patients  with  IC/BPS,  both  female  and  male,  present  with  varying 
degrees of discomfort and/or pain perceived to be related to the blad-
der and associated with urinary storage symptoms, including daytime 
and  nighttime  urinary  frequency  and  urinary  urgency.  For  some 
patients, urinary symptoms (the most common complaint after blad-
der  pain)  are  the  most  bothersome,  while  for  most  patients,  bladder 
pain causes the most distress and most significantly affects quality of 
life. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with IC/BPS present with 
both types of symptoms, as patients void frequently to relieve pain (or 
because of fear of bladder pain). Typically, this combination of bladder 
pain  and  urinary  frequency  severely  impacts  patients’  quality  of  life, 
social interactions, and physical activities.

Pain-mapping  studies  have  been  used  to  identify  different  pain 
phenotypes within the disease. Nickel and colleagues first described a 
bladder-only phenotype present in 20% of a cohort of female IC/BPS 
patients,  whereas  up  to  80%  of  patients  described  pain  in  the  pelvis 
and at least one site beyond. Common associated conditions include 
IBS  (40%),  pelvic  floor  dysfunctional  pain  syndrome  (40–60%),  vul-
vodynia (17%), fibromyalgia (36%), CFS (10%), and chronic back pain 
(47%). As described above, these multiorgan symptoms may be due to 
central  nervous  system  sensitization  and  associated  spinal  crosstalk, 
which may promote phenotypic progression as patients with one pain 
syndrome  slowly  progress  to  another.  Subsequent  MAPP-led  studies 
among a more heterogeneous UCPPS cohort of men and women have 
supported this concept of specific pain phenotypes, reporting a pelvic-
pain-only phenotype in 25% of participants and pain in the pelvis and 
beyond in up to 75%.

Another  important  finding  from  the  MAPP  investigations  is  their 
identification  of  not  just  a  pelvic-pain-only  phenotype  but  also  of  a 
bladder-focused  phenotype.  The  latter  phenotype  was  identified  by 
patients’  responses  to  two  RAND  Interstitial  Cystitis  Epidemiology 
(RICE)  survey  questions:  whether  they  had  “painful  bladder  filling” 
and/or “painful urinary urgency.” Most female UCPPS patients (88%) 
responded “yes” to at least one of these questions. The bladder-focused 
phenotype  was  associated  with  more  severe  urologic  symptoms  and 
worse quality of life.

Patients  present  with  unique  pain  trajectories.  Some  initially  have 
mild discomfort that progresses over many years to pain with bladder 
filling and finally to chronic unremitting pelvic pain with only short 
periods  of  relief  with  urination.  Other  patients  begin  with  UTI-like 
symptoms and acute bladder and urethral pain with urinary frequency 
and  urgency;  these  manifestations  persist  as  a  chronic  cystitis–like 
syndrome  despite  negative  cultures  and  no  benefit  from  antimicro-
bial  therapy.  Still  other  patients  report  a  waxing  and  waning  of  pain 
over time, with flares exacerbated by diet, anxiety/stress, infection, or 
hormone  cycle  (typically  with  increased  pain  prior  to  menses).  In  a 
longitudinal study of UCPPS patients followed over a 12-month period 
during  routine  care  for  their  disease,  MAPP  investigators  described 
60%  of  patients’  symptoms  as  stable,  20%  as  improved,  and  20%  as 
worsened.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome

Patients with IC/BPS present to their family physician or internist 
with  pelvic  pain  that  typically  increases  in  severity  with  bladder 
filling, other associated pain, and various degrees of urinary symp-
tomatology.  The  course  that  should  be  followed  by  primary  care 
practitioners or general internists during the patient’s workup and 
before  referral  to  a  specialist  is  outlined  in  Table  51-1.  Most  of 
these physicians will not move beyond a suspected diagnosis and 
conservative  advice;  that  is  acceptable.  Patients  with  IC/BPS  can 
often represent diagnostic challenges, and referral to an appropriate 
subspecialist is warranted if any diagnostic uncertainty remains.

A  diagnosis  of  IC/BPS  is  often  missed  and  delayed  for  many 
years because physicians tend to silo patients into various medical- 
specialty streams on the basis of the predominant or most bother-
some symptom. For example, patients presenting with pelvic pain 
in which flares are associated with monthly menstrual cycles may 
be  referred  to  gynecologists.  Patients  with  abdominal/pelvic  pain 
associated  with  diarrhea  and/or  constipation  tend  to  be  referred 
to  gastroenterologists,  while  those  with  generalized  muscle  and 
joint  pain,  perhaps  associated  with  fatigue,  are  referred  to  rheu-
matologists. Patients with urinary symptoms and bladder pain are 
treated for UTIs (even with negative urine cultures) or overactive 
bladder—a  common  bladder  condition  associated  with  urinary 
frequency and urgency, but not pain.

It  would  be  simple  if  the  approach  to  patients  presenting  with 
pelvic  pain  was  only  to  determine  the  actual  pelvic  organ  and/or 
disease causing the symptoms. However, spinal crosstalk, phenotype 
progression over time, central sensitization, and COPCs complicate 
the  picture.  Since  only  ~20–25%  of  patients  eventually  diagnosed 
with  IC/BPS  have  bladder-only  disease,  one  must  not  be  bladder-
centric in approach but rather must consider the entire patient. The 
provider must determine the patient’s “clinical picture”—that is, the 
patient’s unique presenting clinical phenotype.

Urologists have adapted a system of clinical symptom categoriza-
tion for patients with UCPPS. UPOINT, which includes document-
ing the contribution of six distinct domains—Urinary, Psychosocial, 
Organ-specific, Infection, Neurologic, and Tenderness (as in pelvic 
floor muscle tenderness)—has helped categorize patient symptoms 
and allows the practitioner to focus their management on the most 
bothersome  domain,  while  helping  to  avoid  neglecting  domains 
that are often forgotten. While used by many urologists managing 
this condition, UPOINT is not as effective in IC/BPS as it is in male 
CP/CPPS,  probably  because  all  IC/BPS  patients  would  be  catego-
rized, by definition, in the U and O domains.

A  further  simplified  clinical  approach  to  the  assessment  of 
patients with symptoms of IC/BPS is to classify patients with per-
ceived bladder pain (a mandatory criterion for diagnosis) into one 
of  two  categories:  (1)  a  “pelvic-pain-only”  category,  which  would 
include  the  “bladder-pain-only,”  pelvic  floor  dysfunctional  pain, 
and associated gynecologic pain groups; or (2) a “pelvic pain and 
beyond”  category,  which  would  include  patients  with  associated 
COPCs  (such  as  IBS  and  fibromyalgia).  This  approach  has  been 
supported by recent observations from the MAPP investigators.

The contribution of psychosocial parameters, such as depression, 
catastrophizing, anxiety, and stress, and their impact on pain and 
disability  cannot  be  overlooked  and  are  important  to  ascertain  in 
all  cases.  This  approach  to  clinical  phenotyping  will  let  the  phy-
sician  tailor  a  unique  treatment  plan  for  each  individual  patient, 
using combinations of local bladder, pelvic floor, or more general 
systemic therapies.

DIAGNOSIS
IC/BPS  is  a  clinically  heterogeneous  condition  whose  lack  of  a  clear 
etiopathogenesis  presents  difficulties  in  diagnosis.  In  making  a  diag-
nosis of exclusion, clinicians must rule out other confusable diseases 
and identify to the best of their ability the phenotypic presentation of 
the presenting patient. Although attempts have been made to establish 
a set of diagnostic criteria in the past, the specified criteria have proven 
overly stringent and too exclusive to be clinically useful. Furthermore, 
although  several  guidelines  exist  to  aide  in  decision  making  in  diag-
nostic investigations, most investigations serve merely to rule out other 
pathology.  In  contrast,  history  and  physical  examination,  along  with 
some simple laboratory testing, are the most reliable tools with which 
to  establish  a  diagnosis  of  IC/BPS.  Details  of  relevant  investigations, 
some of which may be beyond the scope of the general practitioner or 
internist, are presented here. Table 51-1 offers an approach for the gen-
eral practitioner, and Table 51-2 provides a more complete summary 
of diagnostic recommendations.

 ■ HISTORY AND PHYSICAL (INCLUDING 
FREQUENCY/VOLUME CHARTS)
A  thorough  history  and  physical  examination  are  of  utmost  impor-
tance in diagnosing IC/BPS. A history of the patient’s pain symptoms 
is a logical place to start. The nature, intensity, and timing of the pain 
are all significant factors. Some patients will be less explicit than others 
in describing their pain and may instead describe a sense of pressure, 
burning, or vague fullness in the pelvis or bladder area.

All aspects of the patient’s pain should be explored, as many patients’ 
pain will not be limited to the pelvis or bladder but will be associated 
with  the  genitals,  anus  or  rectum,  perineum,  abdomen,  and  beyond. 
Furthermore,  although  pain  is  commonly  experienced  with  bladder 
filling, patients may also have suprapubic tenderness or pressure with 
voiding or burning or pain in the bladder, urethra, or perineum, with 
radiation into the vagina for women or the prostate, penis, and testicles

for men. In male patients, distinguishing IC/BPS from CP/CPPS can be 
challenging. Physicians must assess for more widespread pain locations 
outside the pelvis; screening for COPCs, particularly IBS, fibromyalgia, 
CFS, back pain, and headache, is important in adequately addressing 
the clinical impact of IC/BPS.

Eliciting and understanding associated LUTS—specifically urinary 
frequency,  urgency,  and  nocturia—should  be  another  focus  of  the 
history. While several confusable diseases can present with LUTS, the 
manifestation of IC/BPS as voiding dysfunction can help guide treat-
ment decisions and is often a significant focus of bother for the patient. 
Having  patients  complete  frequency/volume  charts,  noting  the  time 
and volume of each urination over a 24-hour period, can help provide 
objective  evidence  of  a  LUTS  history  and  facilitate  follow-up  during 
and after treatment.

Physical examination should focus on the abdomen, pelvis, genitals, 
and  pelvic  floor.  The  degree  of  pelvic  floor  relaxation  (i.e.,  degree  of 
muscle  tension  and/or  spasm)  during  examination  is  important  to 
note. Trigger points in the pelvic floor musculature and any areas of 
localized spasticity should be identified. In women, an examination of 
the vulva, vaginal mucosa, and urethral meatus is essential to identify 
the presence of vulvodynia (vulvar mucosal pain with no identifiable 
cause) or any signs of genitourinary syndrome of menopause. In men, 
an examination of the external genitalia and a digital rectal (prostate) 
examination  as  well  as  a  similar  pelvic  floor  examination  should  be 
included to rule out related pathology.

 ■ SYMPTOM SCORES
The quality of a history can be elevated by an accompanying validated, 
objective measurement of the patient’s symptoms. Although several rel-
evant tools exist, the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI) and the 
Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index (ICPI) are the most widely used, are 
commonly employed in research trials as outcome measures, and are 
straightforward enough for the practitioner to perform in an outpatient 
setting.  These  short  questionnaires  document  pain  severity,  urinary 
frequency,  urgency,  and  nocturia  as  well  as  the  bother  experienced 
from each of these symptoms.

More recently, MAPP investigators have suggested that pain and uri-
nary symptoms should be assessed independently using two separate 
questionnaires:  the  Genitourinary  Pain  Index  (GUPI)  to  assess  pain 
and  the  ICSI  to  separately  assess  urinary  symptoms.  This  suggestion 
is  based  on  their  finding  of  variable  effects  of  urologic  pain  versus 
urinary  symptoms  on  quality  of  life  and  mental  health.  Although 
symptom scores should not be relied on as diagnostic tools, their util-
ity in establishing objective baseline measures to monitor response to 
treatment and symptoms over time can be valuable to the patient and 
the practitioner.

 ■ URINE STUDIES
Urine  studies  (urinalysis,  culture,  sensitivity,  and  cytology)  should 
be included in the workup of a patient in whom IC/BPS is suspected. 
However,  their  role  is  mostly  in  ruling  out  other  confusable  disease 
rather than in aiding in the diagnosis of IC/BPS. A microscopic exami-
nation of the urine can reveal abnormalities attributable to the kidney 
that  may  warrant  referral  to  a  nephrologist;  microscopic  hematuria 
may  trigger  cystoscopic  examination  and  referral  to  a  urologist.  The 
presenting symptoms of IC/BPS often mimic those of UTI, which must 
be ruled out by urine cultures. It is important to recognize that IC/BPS 
patients are subject to at least as great a risk of UTIs as the general pop-
ulation and that UTI should be considered when a flare in symptoms is 
reported. Finally, urine cytology should be considered if a diagnosis of 
bladder cancer is suspected or if there is a history of hematuria.

 ■ IMAGING, CYSTOSCOPY, AND URODYNAMICS
More intensive investigations and imaging studies should be considered 
in specific scenarios but need not be routinely performed. Abdominal 
and pelvic imaging studies in selected patients can help identify ana-
tomic  abnormalities  of  the  upper  or  lower  urinary  tracts,  diagnose 
urolithiasis or masses in the upper urinary tract, and rule out hydro-
nephrosis,  which  may  suggest  obstructive  uropathy.  Furthermore, 

brain  imaging  with  functional  MRI  and  quantitative  sensory  testing 
may prove beneficial in establishing a central sensitization phenotype; 
however, this is an emerging field of investigation, and routine brain 
imaging and sensory testing are currently not recommended.

Cystoscopy  is  used  to  rule  out  bladder  pathology—most  impor-
tantly,  bladder  cancer.  Moreover,  cystoscopy  plays  an  important  role 
in  phenotyping  IC/BPS  and  is  required  for  identification  of  Hunner 
lesions. Although a broad consensus is lacking, the authors and others 
advocate for routine cystoscopic evaluation when IC/BPS is suspected, 
given the potential therapeutic implications and the ability of this mea-
sure  to  make  phenotype-directed  therapies  possible.  Finally,  urody-
namics testing should be reserved for specific scenarios—for example, 
cases  in  which  complex  voiding  dysfunction  may  be  contributing  to 
the presentation.
 ■ INTRAVESICAL ANESTHETIC BLADDER 
CHALLENGE AND HYDRODISTENSION
An  intravesical  anesthetic  bladder  challenge  (using  intravesical  lido-
caine) can be done in the outpatient setting and can help distinguish 
bladder-focused pain from pelvic pain of other causes. It can further 
be  harnessed  as  a  therapeutic  strategy  if  the  patient  experiences  an 
improvement in symptoms. Similarly, hydrodistension, which requires 
a  general  or  regional  anesthetic,  can  play  a  diagnostic  or  therapeutic 
role.  Bladder  capacities  of  <400  mL  under  general  anesthesia  have 
correlated with worse pain and poor prognosis. The diagnostic role of 
post-hydrodistension inspection for bladder glomerulations has been 
suggested as a possible important clinical differentiation, although the 
utility of identifying and grading glomerulations is debated.

TREATMENT
Clinical Phenotyping

The  UPOINT  phenotyping  tool  introduced  in  2009  was  the  first 
clinical  tool  to  recognize  that  patients  presenting  with  pelvic 
pain  syndromes  are  a  heterogeneous  population  with  disease  of 
unclear  etiology  that  makes  it  difficult  to  predict  outcomes  in 
individuals with standard therapies. UPOINT is based on a patient- 
centered approach: individualized treatments are matched to patient 
evaluations  by  phenotyping  of  patients  using  six  distinct  clinical 
domains—urinary, psychosocial, organ-specific, infectious, neuro-
logic,  and  tenderness.  Since  its  initial  publication,  follow-up  phe-
notyping studies have indicated that UPOINT is likely better than 
other methods in establishing phenotypic pain patterns in the clinic 
setting as local (bladder specific or pelvic pain only) or widespread 
(pelvic pain and beyond). Similarly, identifying inflammatory sub-
types  (e.g.,  Hunner  lesion  patients)  and  psychological  parameters 
can  help  organize  a  patient’s  management  plan  and  make  it  more 
likely  that  interventions  will  be  successful.  Applying  an  individ-
ualized  multimodal  treatment  approach  has  proven  beneficial  in 
clinical  practice.  A  collection  of  treatment  options  that  might  be 
directed at different domains of disease is presented in Fig. 51-1.

Although  many  of  these  treatments  would  be  considered  out-
side  the  scope  of  a  general  practitioner  or  general  internist,  it 
is  important  for  the  practitioner  to  be  aware  of  them.  In  gen-
eral,  treatment  should  begin  with  more  conservative  measures, 
moving  on  to  oral  regimens  or  more  invasive  procedures  if  the 
patient’s  condition  does  not  improve.  A  patient-centered  approach 
is  paramount  in  considering  treatment  escalation.  The  American 
Urological  Association’s  IC/BPS  guidelines  provide  a  measure 
of  overall  efficacy  of  each  individual  therapy  and  a  suggested 
order  of  implementation  (tiered  approach),  but,  because  of  the 
inability  to  predict  the  response  to  specific  therapies,  it  is  more 
clinically  pragmatic  to  choose  a  multimodal  approach  based  on   
the  individual  patient’s  presenting  clinical  phenotype  or  “clinical   
picture.”  Physicians  are  better  positioned  to  implement  this 
approach  than  are  surgeons  (urologists  and  gynecologists),  who 
tend to be more organ- and surgery-focused when treating IC/BPS 
patients.

 ■ CONSERVATIVE MEASURES
Conservative measures should be implemented for all patients with a 
diagnosis of IC/BPS. These therapies tend to be simple and inexpensive 
to introduce, pose little risk of significant side effects, and can be inten-
sified or abandoned on the basis of the patient’s response.

Patient Education  Patient education and empowerment are para-
mount in this chronic pain disorder. Patients have often seen multiple 
practitioners prior to their diagnosis of IC/BPS. Acknowledging their 
suffering while educating them about their disease can go a long way in 
terms of relieving stress and anxiety related to an unknown and poorly 
understood  problem.  This  acknowledgement  also  helps  to  develop  a 
therapeutic patient–provider relationship. Setting realistic expectations 
and  understanding  that  cure  is  not  the  goal  constitute  an  important 
first step. Several resources are available for patients to explore at their 
own leisure.

Dietary  Modifications  Although  limited  evidence  supports  the 
role of dietary modifications, it has long been recognized that certain 
foods  can  trigger  flares  in  IC/BPS  patients  and  that  simple  dietary 
modifications  can  result  in  meaningful  improvements  in  symptoms. 
Common dietary triggers include acidic and spicy foods and/or drinks, 
caffeinated or alcoholic beverages, artificial sweeteners, and/or gluten 
products; this list is by no means exhaustive, and dietary modifications 
should be made on an individual basis.

Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy 
Involvement of the pelvic floor in the 
pain syndrome can be ascertained on physical examination. Randomized 
studies have shown that, for patients who are found to have dysfunctional 
pelvic floors—muscle spasm, trigger points, or tenderness—contributing 
to their pain syndrome, pelvic floor physiotherapy may be beneficial. 
The musculoskeletal anatomy of the pelvic floor is complex; finding a 
provider with training specifically on the pelvic floor can be difficult 
but is crucial. Because accessing this resource may be financially bur-
densome for the patient, working together to find a way to obtain this 
helpful adjunctive therapy is important.

Psychological Interventions  Mental health and psychosocial fac-
tors  have  long  been  identified  as  significantly  prevalent  in  the  IC/BPS 

population and can impact disease and quality-of-life outcomes. There 
is some indication that, in IC/BPS and other related chronic pain con-
ditions,  mindfulness  and  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  may  improve 
outcomes. Challenges in accessing these therapies are a major barrier, 
and there is a general lack of consensus on which specific interventions 
are best suited to individual patients.

 ■ MEDICAL THERAPIES
Only  two  medications  are  currently  approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and 
Drug  Administration  (FDA)  for  the  treatment  of  IC/BPS:  pentosan 
polysulfate sodium (PPS) given orally and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 
given  intravesically.  However,  a  collection  of  medications,  adminis-
tered orally or intravesically, are commonly used (albeit off-label) for 
this purpose.

Oral Therapies 
•	 PPS  The only FDA-approved oral medication 
for IC/BPS has recently come under scrutiny because of reports regard-
ing  its  association  with  vision-threatening  maculopathy.  Although 
causation  has  yet  to  be  established,  given  its  marginal  benefit  in  the 
treatment  of  IC/BPS,  the  authors  recommend  against  the  long-term 
use  of  this  medication.  For  patients  currently  taking  PPS,  the  risks 
and benefits of treatment must be weighed. Consideration of a trial of 
weaning off the medication may be in the best interest of the patient. 
Any patients experiencing vision-related complaints while taking PPS 
should undergo immediate ophthalmologic assessment.
ANTIBIOTICS  IC/BPS is not an infectious condition, and thus, antibi-
otics should have no role in treatment. Furthermore, the overwhelming 
majority of IC/BPS patients will have received at least one course, if not 
several courses, of antibiotics at some point in the course of their dis-
ease. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to administer a single course 
of antibiotics (after obtaining a sample for urine culture and sensitivity 
testing) if the patient has never previously received such therapy.
AMITRIPTYLINE  Amitriptyline’s  pharmacologic  activity  is  attribut-
able primarily to its anticholinergic properties, its serotonin and nor-
epinephrine uptake–inhibiting activity, and its sedative effects, which 
may include an antihistaminic pathway. Amitriptyline has been used 
to  treat  IC/BPS  and  other  chronic  pain  syndromes.  Studies  support

330

the use of amitriptyline in IC/BPS patients while recognizing that the 
benefits can be marginal and associated with significant side effects.

CIMETIDINE  AND  HYDROXYZINE  Early  nonrandomized  studies  of 
hydroxyzine in the treatment of IC/BPS yielded promising results. As 
with amitriptyline, hydroxyzine’s mechanism of action in treating IC/
BPS is not fully understood and is likely multifactorial, owing largely 
to  its  antihistaminic  effect  via  H1-receptor  antagonism  but  perhaps 
also  its  anticholinergic  properties,  its  anxiolytic  and  sedative  effects, 
and its inhibition of mast cell secretion and activation. An underpow-
ered  randomized  study  found  no  significant  difference  in  symptom 
improvement between hydroxyzine and placebo.

After the modest success reported for hydroxyzine, cimetidine—an 
H2-receptor  antagonist—was  investigated  as  another  possible  IC/BPS 
treatment. Only two observational studies and a single, small random-
ized clinical trial were completed and showed improvement in supra-
pubic pain and LUTS, particularly urinary frequency.

GABAPENTINOIDS  Although  no  randomized  studies  of  gabap-
entinoids have been performed in the IC/BPS population, these agents 
have been shown to improve symptoms in related chronic pain condi-
tions.  Furthermore,  observational  studies  have  shown  some  efficacy 
in IC/BPS. In properly selected patients in whom neuropathic pain is 
suspected, this medication class may have some success.

CYCLOSPORIN A  Despite its significant side effect profile, cyclosporin 
A  has  been  investigated  as  treatment  for  IC/BPS  refractory  to  other, 
more  standard  therapies.  Because  of  its  potent  anti-inflammatory 
properties  (it  is  used  extensively  in  organ  transplant  recipients),  this 
drug is particularly effective in IC/BPS patients with Hunner lesions, 
although the improvement in symptoms is modest. Side effects, includ-
ing hypertension and nephrotoxicity, must be carefully monitored for, 
and the medication is typically reserved for patients in whom standard 
therapies have failed.

Intravesical  Therapies 
Intravesical  instillations  remain  a  main-
stay in the management of bladder-specific pain. Although this treat-
ment  modality  typically  requires  an  office  visit,  able  and  motivated 
patients can be trained to administer the medication at home. Patients’ 
responses are variable, and the treatment is not curative, but it can sig-
nificantly change the trajectory of disease in some patients and can res-
cue those experiencing symptom flares. Intravesical instillations can be 
administered as induction therapy; maintenance strategies have been 
proposed and can be effective for properly selected patients. A plethora 
of agents—most of them used off-label for this indication—have been 
investigated. The best-studied options are reviewed here.

DMSO  DMSO, a solvent with anti-inflammatory properties, has been 
used in intravesical treatment for IC/BPS for several years. Despite a 
lack  of  high-quality  evidence  (with  efficacy  documented  in  only  one 
placebo-controlled  randomized  clinical  trial),  DMSO  remains  the 
only FDA-approved intravesical medication for IC/BPS treatment. Its 
use has fallen out of favor, however, largely because of its unpleasant 
side effect of halitosis (its elimination via the lungs is associated with 
a garlic-like odor). Although the degree of improvement in symptoms 
is highly variable (60–95%), DMSO remains in the armamentarium of 
intravesical therapies.
HEPARIN  Heparin,  a  glycosaminoglycan,  was  first  investigated  as  a 
treatment for IC/BPS in light of the glycosaminoglycan layer deficiency 
theory  of  IC/BPS  etiology;  in  animal  models,  heparin  was  shown  to 
restore areas of damaged urothelium. Although there are no random-
ized  clinical  trials  showing  its  efficacy,  several  observational  studies 
have  suggested  benefit.  Furthermore,  in  current  practice,  heparin  is 
commonly administered with other medications as part of an intraves-
ical “cocktail.” Systemic absorption is minimal and appears not to affect 
coagulation parameters.
LIDOCAINE  Lidocaine is commonly used as a local anesthetic and has 
been  investigated  as  an  option  for  intravesical  treatment  for  IC/BPS. 
This  agent  works  by  blocking  sensory  nerves  in  the  urothelium.  Its 

absorption and efficacy increase by alkalinization, commonly through 
coadministration with sodium bicarbonate.
HYALURONIC  ACID  AND  CHONDROITIN  SULFATE  Hyaluronic  acid 
and, more recently, chondroitin sulfate have been targeted as potential 
intravesical therapies because of their potentially restorative impact on 
the glycosaminoglycan layer. As is the case with most intravesical ther-
apies, the quality of evidence is low, but there appears to be a modest 
benefit, with few side effects. Thus, these agents remain as options for 
patients whose disease is refractory to more standard therapies.

Trigger  Point  Injection 
Injection  of  a  local  anesthetic  into 
myofascial  trigger  points  in  the  pelvic  floor  (identified  on  physical 
examination)  is  a  minimally  invasive,  practical  therapy  that  can  be 
administered during an office visit and can provide relief in properly 
selected patients. As with all therapies for this chronic pain condition, 
patient selection is paramount. The evidence supporting this treatment 
is largely anecdotal and based on expert opinion. A small nonblinded 
observational trial found a 72% success rate among women diagnosed 
with chronic pelvic pain and trigger points on physical examination; 
33% of women were completely pain free after the injection. Although 
robust  prospective  trials  are  needed,  this  modality  adds  to  the  clini-
cian’s armamentarium in the treatment of IC/BPS.

 ■ SURGICAL THERAPIES
Treatment  of  Hunner  Lesions  A  unique  subset  of  IC/BPS 
patients have Hunner lesions. Direct treatment of these lesions through 
ablation with cauterization or laser treatment or, alternatively, injection 
of the lesion with a glucocorticoid improves symptoms in 70–90% of 
these  patients.  Hunner  lesions  tend  to  be  recurrent,  however;  thus, 
treated patients still require follow-up, with consideration of a multi-
modal approach to their disease.

Hydrodistension  Recent  reports  confirm  that  one  of  the  oldest 
therapies for IC/BPS, hydrodistension under general anesthesia, pro-
vides  some  benefit  in  up  to  54%  of  patients.  Short-  and  long-term 
adverse effects (including bladder perforation and long-term bladder 
wall fibrosis) and the temporary nature of the benefit (with symptoms 
typically  recurring  within  3–12  months)  mean  that  repeated  bladder 
distension may not be an ideal long-term management strategy.

Onabotulinum  Toxin  A  Onabotulinum  toxin  A  (i.e.,  Botox) 
has been used to treat IC/BPS. There has, however, never been a ran-
domized,  placebo-controlled  study  evaluating  onabotulinum  toxin 
A injection into the detrusor muscle as monotherapy in this disease. 
Several  randomized  studies  have  evaluated  this  agent’s  efficacy  and 
have  shown  improvements  in  symptoms;  unfortunately,  these  trials 
often use onabotulinum toxin A in combination with hydrodistension, 
lack a placebo arm, and do not control for LUTS. Attributing benefit to 
this treatment is thus challenging. Furthermore, the side effect of acute 
urinary retention can be catastrophic in IC/BPS patients, whose pain is 
often secondary to bladder filling.

Sacral  Neuromodulation 
In  properly  selected  patients,  sacral 
neuromodulation  (SNM)  can  provide  symptom  relief  in  IC/BPS.  Its 
use for this purpose is off-label, and it is not FDA approved for pain 
therapy. Nevertheless, SNM is FDA approved for treatment of bladder 
overactivity—a common symptom in IC/BPS patients—that is refrac-
tory to standard therapies. Although studies evaluating improvements 
in pain have shown variable results, a recent meta-analysis examining 
17 observational trials (but no randomized clinical trials) of the use of 
SNM for IC/BPS does support its efficacy, with a statistically significant 
pooled treatment success rate of up to 84%. Side effects related to SNM 
must  be  considered,  and  the  procedure  carries  with  it  a  high  rate  of 
revision surgery, which is needed in up to half of patients undergoing 
this treatment.

Radical  Surgery  Radical  surgery  for  the  treatment  of  IC/BPS  is 
reserved as a modality of desperation for the most refractory patients.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesOptions  range  from  substitution  cystoplasty  to  cystectomy  with  uri-
nary diversion. Although improved symptoms and quality of life may 
result, such surgery is a potentially morbid operation and patient selec-
tion must be very specific.

COMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS
IC/BPS is not unlike other chronic pain conditions in that, although a 
clear link has not been established with higher mortality, this condition 
is  certainly  associated  with  significant  disability,  decreased  quality  of 
life, and significant mental health morbidity. The economic impact of 
the disability associated with IC/BPS is similar to that of fibromyalgia, 
low  back  pain,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  and  peripheral  neuropathy.  Sui-
cidal  ideation  is  a  reality  in  this  patient  population,  with  a  reported 
prevalence as high as 11–23%.

For most patients, IC/BPS onset is subacute, with continuous devel-
opment of the classic symptom complex over a short time and rapid 
(within 5 years) progression to its final stage. Symptoms then continue 
to wax and wane without significant overall change in symptomatology 
for the majority of patients. However, spontaneous improvement and/
or resolution occurs in some patients, while a small subset experience 
subsequent  deterioration  to  a  small-capacity,  fibrotic,  noncompliant 
bladder  (“end-stage  bladder”).  A  multimodal  approach  to  therapy, 
interdisciplinary  involvement  in  patient  care,  particular  attention  to 
psychosocial  parameters,  and  check-ins  on  mental  health  are  impor-
tant aspects of ongoing care.

GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Significant  challenges  have  been  encountered  in  confirming  the 
prevalence of IC/BPS, particularly globally. Prevalence estimates have 
ranged widely from as low as 3.5 per 100,000 women in a study of a 
Japanese population to as high as 20,000 per 100,000 in a self-report 
questionnaire  study  of  a  U.S.  population.  Despite  these  challenges,  it 
has been recognized that IC/BPS is not simply a disease of the global 
West. Although robust epidemiologic studies outside North America, 
Europe, and some regions of Asia are lacking, it is presumed that this 
disease  occurs  at  similar  rates  globally.  This  presumption  may  be 
extrapolated  from  epidemiologic  studies  of  a  related  population  and 
its male counterpart: CP/CPPS. These studies have shown rates of CP/
CPPS  in  African  and  Asian  populations  that  are  similar  to  rates  in 
North American populations.

There is no evidence to suggest that IC/BPS is phenotypically dis-
tinct  in  various  geographic  regions.  Thus,  this  condition  should  be 
diagnosed and treated in the same ways globally. Given that its diag-
nosis of exclusion is based largely on history and physical examination 
and its treatment is based on a minimally invasive algorithm, with the 
focus on the patient’s clinical phenotype and the initial implementation 
of  conservative  therapeutic  measures,  IC/BPS  can  be  well  managed 
even in resource-poor settings. As with many poorly understood and 
difficult-to-treat  conditions,  the  greatest  barrier  to  its  diagnosis  and 
treatment may perhaps be its recognition.

52 Azotemia and Urinary 
Abnormalities
David B. Mount

Normal kidney functions occur through numerous cellular processes 
to maintain body homeostasis. Disturbances in any of these functions 
can lead to abnormalities that may be detrimental to survival. Clini-
cal manifestations of these disorders depend on the pathophysiology 
of  renal  injury  and  often  are  identified  as  a  complex  of  symptoms, 
abnormal  physical  findings,  and  laboratory  changes  that  constitute 
specific  syndromes.  These  renal  syndromes  (Table  52-1)  may  arise 
from  systemic  illness  or  as  primary  renal  disease.  Nephrologic  syn-
dromes usually consist of several elements that reflect the underlying 
pathologic processes, typically including one or more of the following: 
(1)  reduction  in  glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR),  (2)  abnormalities 
of urine sediment (red blood cells [RBCs], white blood cells [WBCs], 
casts, and crystals), (3) abnormal urinary excretion of serum proteins 
(proteinuria), (4) disturbances in urine volume (oliguria, anuria, poly-
uria), (5) presence of hypertension and/or expanded total body fluid 
volume  (edema),  (6)  electrolyte  abnormalities,  and  (7)  in  some  syn-
dromes, fever/pain. The specific combination of these findings should 
permit  identification  of  one  of  the  major  nephrologic  syndromes 
(Table 52-1) and allow differential diagnoses to be narrowed so that the 
appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic course can be determined. All 
these  syndromes  and  their  associated  diseases  are  discussed  in  more 
detail in subsequent chapters. This chapter focuses on several aspects 
of renal abnormalities that are critically important for distinguishing 
among  those  processes:  (1)  reduction  in  GFR,  (2)  alterations  of  the 
urinary  sediment  and/or  protein  excretion,  and  (3)  abnormalities  of 
urinary volume.

AZOTEMIA
 ■ ASSESSMENT OF GFR
Monitoring the GFR is important in both hospital and outpatient set-
tings, and several different methodologies are available. GFR is the pri-
mary metric for kidney “function,” and its direct measurement involves 
administration of a radioactive isotope (such as inulin or iothalamate) 
that is filtered at the glomerulus into the urinary space but is neither 
reabsorbed  nor  secreted  throughout  the  tubule.  GFR—i.e.,  the  clear-
ance  of  inulin  or  iothalamate  in  milliliters  per  minute—is  calculated 
from  the  rate  of  appearance  of  the  isotope  in  the  urine  over  several 
hours. In most clinical circumstances, direct GFR measurement is not 
feasible, and the plasma creatinine level is used as a surrogate to esti-
mate GFR. Plasma creatinine (PCr) is the most widely used marker for 
GFR, which is related directly to urine creatinine (UCr) excretion and 
inversely to PCr. On the basis of this relationship (with some important 
caveats, as discussed below), GFR will fall in roughly inverse propor-
tion to the rise in PCr. Failure to account for GFR reductions in drug 
dosing can lead to significant morbidity and death from drug toxicities 
(e.g.,  digoxin,  imipenem).  In  the  outpatient  setting,  PCr  serves  as  an 
estimate for GFR (although much less accurate; see below). In patients 
with chronic progressive renal disease, there is an approximately linear 
relationship between 1/PCr (y axis) and time (x axis). The slope of that 
line  will  remain  constant  for  an  individual;  when  values  deviate,  an 
investigation for a superimposed acute process (e.g., volume depletion, 
drug  reaction)  should  be  initiated.  Signs  and  symptoms  of  uremia, 
the clinical symptom complex associated with renal failure, develop at 
significantly different levels of PCr, depending on the patient (size, age, 
and  sex),  underlying  renal  disease,  existence  of  concurrent  diseases, 
and true GFR. Generally, patients do not develop symptomatic uremia 
until renal insufficiency is severe (GFR <15 mL/min).

A  significantly  reduced  GFR  (either  acute  or  chronic)  is  usually 
reflected  in  a  rise  in  PCr,  leading  to  retention  of  nitrogenous  waste 
products (defined as azotemia) such as urea. Azotemia may result from

reduced renal perfusion, intrinsic renal disease, or postrenal processes 
(ureteral obstruction; see below and Fig. 52-1). Precise determination 
of GFR is problematic, as both commonly measured indices (urea and 
creatinine)  have  characteristics  that  affect  their  accuracy  as  markers 
of  clearance.  Urea  clearance  may  underestimate  GFR  significantly 
because  of  urea  reabsorption  by  the  tubule.  In  contrast,  creatinine  is 
derived from muscle metabolism of creatine, and its generation varies 
little from day to day.

Creatinine clearance (CrCl), an approximation of GFR, is measured 
from plasma and urinary creatinine excretion rates for a defined period 
(usually 24 h) and is expressed in milliliters per minute: CrCl = (Uvol ×  
UCr)/(PCr × Tmin). The “adequacy” or “completeness” of the urinary col-
lection is estimated by the urinary volume and creatinine content; cre-
atinine is produced from muscle and excreted at a relatively constant 

rate.  For  a  20-  to  50-year-old  man,  creatinine  excretion  should  be 
18.5–25.0 mg/kg body weight; for a woman of the same age, it should 
be 16.5–22.4 mg/kg body weight. For example, an 80-kg man should 
excrete  between  ~1500  and  2000  mg  of  creatinine  in  an  “adequate” 
collection. Creatinine is useful for estimating GFR because it is a small, 
freely filtered solute that is not reabsorbed by the tubules. PCr levels can 
increase acutely from dietary ingestion of cooked meat, however, and 
creatinine can be secreted into the proximal tubule through an organic 
cation  pathway  (especially  in  advanced  progressive  chronic  kidney 
disease [CKD]), leading to overestimation of GFR. When a timed col-
lection for CrCl is not available, decisions about drug dosing must be 
based on PCr alone. Two formulas are used widely to estimate kidney 
function  from  PCr:  (1)  Cockcroft-Gault  and  (2)  four-variable  MDRD 
(Modification of Diet in Renal Disease).

Numerous  websites  are  available  to  assist  with  these  calcula-
tions (www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm). A newer 
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) esti-
mated GFR (eGFR), which was developed by pooling several cohorts 
with and without kidney disease who had data on directly measured 
GFR, appears to be more accurate:

CKD-EPI: eGFR = 141 × min (PCr/k, 1)a × max (PCr/k, 1)–1.209  
× 0.993Age × 1.018 [if female] × 1.159 [if black],

where PCr is plasma creatinine, k is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, a is 
–0.329 for females and –0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of 
PCr/k or 1, and max indicates the maximum of PCr/k or 1 (https://www.
mdcalc.com/ckd-epi-equations-glomerular-filtration-rate-gfr).

There are limitations to all creatinine-based estimates of GFR. Each 
equation, along with 24-h urine collection for measurement of creatin-
ine clearance, is based on the assumption that the patient is in steady 
state, without daily increases or decreases in PCr as a result of rapidly 
changing GFR. The MDRD equation is better correlated with true GFR 
when the GFR is <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. The gradual loss of muscle 
from  chronic  illness,  chronic  use  of  glucocorticoids,  or  malnutrition 
can  mask  significant  changes  in  GFR  with  small  or  imperceptible 
changes in PCr.

The  coefficient  of  1.159  in  the  CKD-EPI  equation  to  adjust  for 
self-reported  black  race  reflects  that  measured  GFR  was  16%  higher 
in  blacks  than  nonblacks  with  similar  age,  sex,  and  creatinine  in  the 
data  set  used  to  develop  the  equation.  Race  is  a  social  rather  than  a 
biological  construct,  for  which  reason  the  use  of  the  “race  modifier” 
in  calculating  eGFR  using  CKD-EPI  and  other  equations  has  come 
under  scrutiny.  In  particular,  given  the  implications  of  utilizing 
self-reported race to modify clinical laboratory results, many medical 
centers have recently stopped reporting eGFRs that have been calcu-
lated using a race modifier. This change is projected to have positive 
consequences,  in  particular,  improved  access  to  waitlisting  for  renal 
transplantation in black patients at an earlier stage of CKD. Potential 
negative consequences include “overdiagnosis” of CKD, inadequate or 
inaccurate dosing of drugs that are eliminated through the kidney (e.g.,

metformin),  reduced  access  to  imaging  modalities  for  black  patients 
with CKD with a lower reported eGFR, and reductions in living kidney 
donation among blacks. These and the other limitations in creatinine- 
based  eGFR  have  led  to  the  development  of  alternative  methods  for 
estimating GFR.

Cystatin C, a member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine pro-
tease inhibitors, is produced at a relatively constant rate from all nucle-
ated cells. Serum cystatin C has been proposed to be a more sensitive 
marker of early GFR decline than is PCr, with lesser effects of muscle 
mass on circulating levels; however, cystatin C levels are influenced by 
the  patient’s  sex  and  the  presence  of  diabetes  mellitus,  smoking,  and 
inflammation. To the extent that cystatin C–based calculation of eGFR 
is less affected by self-reported race and muscle mass, it is an increas-
ingly important adjunct to creatinine-based eGFR.

Once  GFR  reduction  has  been  established,  the  physician  must 
decide  if  it  represents  acute  or  chronic  renal  injury.  The  clinical 
circumstances, history, and laboratory data often make this an easy 
distinction. However, the laboratory abnormalities characteristic of 
chronic renal failure, including anemia, hypocalcemia, and hyper-
phosphatemia,  are  also  often  present  in  patients  presenting  with 
acute renal failure. Radiographic evidence of renal osteodystrophy 
(Chap. 311) can be seen only in chronic renal failure but is a very 
late  finding,  typically  in  patients  with  end-stage  renal  disease 
(ESRD)  maintained  on  dialysis.  The  urinalysis  and  renal  ultra-
sound can facilitate distinguishing acute from chronic renal failure. 
An  approach  to  the  evaluation  of  azotemic  patients  is  shown  in   
Fig. 52-1. Patients with advanced chronic renal insufficiency often 
have some proteinuria, nonconcentrated urine (isosthenuria; isos-
motic  with  plasma),  and  small  kidneys  on  ultrasound,  character-
ized  by  increased  echogenicity  and  cortical  thinning.  Treatment 
should be directed toward slowing the progression of renal disease  
and providing symptomatic relief for edema, acidosis, anemia, and 
hyperphosphatemia, as discussed in Chap. 311. Acute renal failure 
(Chap.  310)  can  result  from  processes  that  affect  blood  flow  and 
glomerular  perfusion  (prerenal  azotemia),  intrinsic  renal  diseases 
(affecting  small  vessels,  glomeruli,  or  tubules),  or  postrenal  pro-
cesses  (obstruction  of  urine  flow  in  ureters,  bladder,  or  urethra) 
(Chap. 319). 

PRERENAL FAILURE
Decreased  renal  perfusion  accounts  for  40–80%  of  cases  of  acute 
renal failure and, if appropriately treated, is readily reversible. The 
etiologies of prerenal azotemia include any cause of decreased cir-
culating  blood  volume  (gastrointestinal  hemorrhage,  burns,  diar-
rhea,  diuretics),  volume  sequestration  (pancreatitis,  peritonitis, 
rhabdomyolysis),  or  decreased  effective  arterial  volume  (cardio-
genic  shock,  sepsis).  Renal  and  glomerular  perfusion  also  can  be 
affected  by  reductions  in  cardiac  output  from  peripheral  vasodi-
lation  (sepsis,  drugs)  or  profound  renal  vasoconstriction  (severe 
heart  failure,  hepatorenal  syndrome,  agents  such  as  nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs  [NSAIDs]).  True  or  “effective”  arterial 
hypovolemia leads to a fall in mean arterial pressure, which in turn 
triggers a series of neural and humoral responses, including activa-
tion of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
systems  and  vasopressin  (AVP)  release.  GFR  is  maintained  by   
prostaglandin-mediated dilatation of afferent arterioles and angi-
otensin  II–mediated  constriction  of  efferent  arterioles.  Once 
the  mean  arterial  pressure  falls  below  80  mmHg,  GFR  declines 
steeply.

Blockade of prostaglandin production by NSAIDs can result in 
severe vasoconstriction and acute renal failure. Blocking angioten-
sin  action  with  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors 

or  angiotensin  receptor  blockers  (ARBs)  decreases  efferent  arte-
riolar  tone  and  in  turn  decreases  glomerular  capillary  perfusion 
pressure. Patients taking NSAIDs and/or ACE inhibitors/ARBs are 
most susceptible to hemodynamically mediated acute renal failure 
when  blood  volume  or  arterial  perfusion  pressure  is  reduced  for 
any  reason;  under  these  circumstances,  preservation  of  GFR  is 
dependent on afferent vasodilation due to prostaglandins and effer-
ent  vasoconstriction  due  to  angiotensin  II.  Patients  with  bilateral 
renal artery stenosis (or stenosis in a solitary kidney) can also be 
dependent on efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction for maintenance 
of glomerular filtration pressure and are particularly susceptible to 
a precipitous decline in GFR when given ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
Prolonged renal hypoperfusion may lead to acute tubular necro-
sis  (ATN),  an  intrinsic  renal  disease  that  is  discussed  below.  The 
urinalysis  and  urinary  electrolyte  measurements  can  be  useful  in 
distinguishing  prerenal  azotemia  from  ATN  (Table  52-2).  The 
urine Na and osmolality of patients with prerenal azotemia can be 
predicted  from  the  stimulatory  actions  of  norepinephrine,  angi-
otensin  II,  AVP,  aldosterone,  and  low  tubule  fluid  flow  rate.  In 
prerenal conditions, the tubules are intact, leading to a concentrated 
urine (>500 mosmol), avid Na retention (urine Na concentration, 
<20 mmol/L; fractional excretion of Na [FENa], <1%), and UCr/PCr 
>40  (Table  52-2).  The  FENa  is  typically  >1%  in  ATN,  but  may  be 
<1%  in  patients  with  milder,  nonoliguric  ATN  (e.g.,  from  rhabd-
omyolysis)  and  in  patients  with  underlying  “prerenal”  disorders, 
such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or cirrhosis or hepatorenal 
syndrome.  The  prerenal  urine  sediment  is  usually  normal  or  has 
hyaline and granular casts, whereas the sediment of ATN usually is 
filled with cellular debris, tubular epithelial casts, and dark (muddy 
brown)  granular  casts.  The  measurement  of  urinary  biomarkers 
associated  with  tubular  injury  is  a  promising  technique  to  detect 
subclinical  ATN  and/or  help  further  diagnose  the  exact  cause  of 
acute renal failure. 

POSTRENAL AZOTEMIA
Urinary tract obstruction accounts for <5% of cases of acute renal 
failure but is usually reversible and must be ruled out early in the 
evaluation (Fig. 52-1). Since a single kidney is capable of adequate 
clearance, complete obstructive acute renal failure requires obstruc-
tion at the urethra or bladder outlet, bilateral ureteral obstruction, 
or  unilateral  obstruction  in  a  patient  with  a  single  functioning 
kidney.  Obstruction  is  usually  diagnosed  by  the  presence  of  ure-
teral and renal pelvic dilation on renal ultrasound. However, early 
in  the  course  of  obstruction  or  if  the  ureters  are  unable  to  dilate 
(e.g., encasement by pelvic or periureteral tumors or by retroperito-
neal fibrosis), the ultrasound examination may be negative. Other

study), may be required to better define the presence or absence of 
obstructive  uropathy.  The  specific  urologic  conditions  that  cause 
obstruction are discussed in Chap. 319. 

INTRINSIC RENAL DISEASE
When  prerenal  and  postrenal  azotemia  have  been  excluded  as 
etiologies of renal failure, an intrinsic parenchymal renal disease is 
present. Intrinsic renal disease can arise from processes involving 
large  renal  vessels,  intrarenal  microvasculature  and  glomeruli,  or 
the tubulointerstitium. Ischemic and toxic ATN account for ~90% 
of cases of acute intrinsic renal failure. As outlined in Fig. 52-1, the 
clinical setting and urinalysis are helpful in separating the possible 
etiologies.  Prerenal  azotemia  and  ATN  are  part  of  a  spectrum  of 
renal  hypoperfusion;  evidence  of  structural  tubule  injury  is  pres-
ent  in  ATN,  whereas  prompt  reversibility  occurs  with  prerenal 
azotemia upon restoration of adequate renal perfusion. Thus, ATN 
often can be distinguished from prerenal azotemia by urinalysis and 
urine electrolyte composition (Table 52-2 and Fig. 52-1). Ischemic 
ATN is observed most frequently in patients who have undergone 
major surgery, trauma, severe hypovolemia, overwhelming sepsis, 
or extensive burns. Nephrotoxic ATN complicates the administra-
tion of many common medications, usually by inducing a combi-
nation  of  intrarenal  vasoconstriction,  direct  tubule  toxicity,  and/
or tubular obstruction. The kidney is vulnerable to toxic injury by 
virtue of its rich blood supply (25% of cardiac output) and its ability 
to concentrate and metabolize toxins. A diligent search for hypoten-
sion  and  nephrotoxins  usually  uncovers  the  specific  etiology  of 
ATN.  Discontinuation  of  nephrotoxins  and  stabilization  of  blood 
pressure  often  suffice  without  the  need  for  dialysis,  with  ongoing 
regeneration of tubular cells. An extensive list of potential drugs 
and toxins implicated in ATN is found in Chap. 310.

Processes  involving  the  tubules  and  interstitium  can  lead  to 
acute kidney injury (AKI), a subtype of acute renal failure. These 
processes include drug-induced interstitial nephritis (especially by 
antibiotics, NSAIDs, and diuretics), severe infections (both bacte-
rial and viral), systemic diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythemato-
sus), and systemic disorders (e.g., sarcoidosis, Sjögren’s syndrome, 
lymphoma,  or  leukemia).  A  list  of  drugs  associated  with  allergic 
interstitial  nephritis  is  found  in  Chap.  316.  Urinalysis  usually 
shows mild to moderate proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria (~75% 
of cases) and occasionally WBC casts. The finding of RBC casts in 
interstitial nephritis has been reported but should prompt a search 
for glomerular diseases (Fig. 52-1). Occasionally, renal biopsy will 
be  needed  to  distinguish  among  these  possibilities.  The  classic 
sediment finding in allergic interstitial nephritis is a predominance 
(>10%) of urinary eosinophils with Wright’s or Hansel’s stain; how-
ever, urinary eosinophils can be increased in several other causes of 
AKI, such that measurement of urine eosinophils has no diagnostic 
utility in renal disease.

Occlusion of large renal vessels, including arteries and veins, is 
an uncommon cause of acute renal failure. A significant reduction 
in  GFR  by  this  mechanism  suggests  bilateral  processes  or,  in  a 
patient  with  a  single  functioning  kidney,  a  unilateral  process.  In 
patients  with  preexisting  renal  artery  stenosis,  a  substantial  renal 
collateral  circulation  can  develop  over  time  and  sustain  renal   
perfusion—typically not enough to sustain glomerular filtration—
in  the  event  of  total  renal  artery  occlusion.  Renal  arteries  can  be 
occluded  with  atheroemboli,  thromboemboli,  in  situ  thrombosis, 
aortic  dissection,  or  vasculitis.  Atheroembolic  renal  failure  can 
occur spontaneously but most often is associated with recent aor-
tic  instrumentation.  The  emboli  are  cholesterol-rich  and  lodge  in 
medium and small renal arteries, with a consequent eosinophil-rich 
inflammatory  reaction.  Patients  with  atheroembolic  acute  renal 
failure  often  have  a  normal  urinalysis,  but  the  urine  may  contain 
eosinophils  and  casts.  The  diagnosis  can  be  confirmed  by  renal 
biopsy, but this procedure is often unnecessary when other stigmata 

of  atheroemboli  are  present  (livedo  reticularis,  distal  peripheral 
infarcts,  eosinophilia).  Renal  artery  thrombosis  may  lead  to  mild 
proteinuria and hematuria, whereas renal vein thrombosis typically 
occurs  in  the  context  of  heavy  proteinuria  and  hematuria.  These 
vascular complications often require angiography for confirmation 
and are discussed in Chap. 317.

Diseases  of  the  glomeruli  (glomerulonephritis  and  vasculitis) 
and  the  renal  microvasculature  (hemolytic-uremic  syndromes, 
thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura,  and  malignant  hyperten-
sion)  usually  present  with  various  combinations  of  glomerular 
injury:  proteinuria,  hematuria,  reduced  GFR,  and  alterations  of 
sodium excretion that lead to hypertension, edema, and circulatory 
congestion (acute nephritic syndrome). These findings may occur 
as primary renal diseases or as renal manifestations of systemic dis-
eases. The clinical setting and other laboratory data help distinguish 
primary renal diseases from systemic diseases. The finding of RBC 
casts in the urine is an indication for early renal biopsy (Fig. 52-1), 
as the pathologic pattern has important implications for diagnosis, 
prognosis,  and  treatment.  Hematuria  without  RBC  casts  can  also 
be an indication of glomerular disease, since RBC casts are highly 
specific but very insensitive for glomerulonephritis. The specificity 
of  urine  microscopy  can  be  enhanced  by  examining  urine  with  a 
phase  contrast  microscope  capable  of  detecting  dysmorphic  red 
cells  (“acanthocytes”)  that  are  associated  with  glomerular  disease. 
This evaluation is summarized in Fig. 52-2. A detailed discussion 
of glomerulonephritis and diseases of the microvasculature is found 
in Chap. 316.

OLIGURIA AND ANURIA
Oliguria refers to a 24-h urine output <400 mL, and anuria is the 
complete  absence  of  urine  formation  (<100  mL).  Anuria  can  be 
caused  by  complete  bilateral  urinary  tract  obstruction;  a  vascular 
catastrophe  (dissection  or  arterial  occlusion);  renal  vein  throm-
bosis; acute cast nephropathy in myeloma; renal cortical necrosis; 
severe ATN; combined therapy with NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and/
or ARBs; and hypovolemic, cardiogenic, or septic shock. Oliguria 
is never normal, since at least 400 mL of maximally concentrated 
urine must be produced to excrete the obligate daily osmolar load. 
Nonoliguria refers to urine output >400 mL/d in patients with acute 
or chronic azotemia. With nonoliguric ATN, disturbances of potas-
sium and hydrogen balance are less severe than in oliguric patients, 
and recovery to normal renal function is usually more rapid.

ABNORMALITIES OF THE URINE
 ■ PROTEINURIA
The evaluation of proteinuria is shown schematically in Fig. 52-3 and 
typically  is  initiated  after  detection  of  proteinuria  by  dipstick  exami-
nation.  The  dipstick  measurement  detects  only  albumin  and  gives 
false-positive results at pH >7.0 or when the urine is very concentrated 
or  contaminated  with  blood.  Because  the  dipstick  relies  on  urinary 
albumin  concentration,  a  very  dilute  urine  may  obscure  significant 
proteinuria  on  dipstick  examination.  Quantification  of  urinary  albu-
min  on  a  spot  urine  sample  (ideally  from  a  first  morning  void)  by 
measurement  of  an  albumin-to-creatinine  ratio  (ACR)  is  helpful  in 
approximating  a  24-h  albumin  excretion  rate  (AER),  where  ACR 
(mg/g)  ≈  AER  (mg/24  h).  Furthermore,  proteinuria  that  is  not  pre-
dominantly due to albumin will be missed by dipstick screening. This 
information is particularly important for the detection of Bence-Jones 
proteins in the urine of patients with multiple myeloma. Tests to mea-
sure total urine protein concentration accurately rely on precipitation 

PROTEINURIA ON URINE DIPSTICK

with  sulfosalicylic  or  trichloroacetic  acid  (Fig.  52-3).  As  with  albu-
minuria,  the  ratio  of  protein  to  creatinine  in  a  random,  “spot”  urine 
can  also  provide  a  rough  estimate  of  protein  excretion;  for  example, 
a protein/creatinine ratio of 3.0 correlates to ~3.0 g of proteinuria per 
day.  Formal  assessment  of  urinary  protein  excretion  requires  a  24-h 
urine protein collection (see “Measurement of GFR,” above).

The  magnitude  of  proteinuria  and  its  composition  in  the  urine 
depend on the mechanism of renal injury that leads to protein losses. 
Both charge and size selectivity normally prevent virtually all plasma 
albumin,  globulins,  and  other  high-molecular-weight  proteins  from 
crossing  the  glomerular  wall;  however,  if  this  barrier  is  disrupted, 
plasma  proteins  may  leak  into  the  urine  (glomerular  proteinuria;  
Fig. 52-3). Smaller proteins (<20 kDa) are freely filtered but are read-
ily  reabsorbed  by  the  proximal  tubule.  Typically,  healthy  individuals 
excrete <150 mg/d of total protein and <30 mg/d of albumin. However, 
even  at  albuminuria  levels  <30  mg/d,  risk  for  progression  to  overt 
nephropathy  or  subsequent  cardiovascular  disease  is  increased.  The 
remainder of the protein in the urine is secreted by the tubules (Tamm- 
Horsfall,  IgA,  and  urokinase)  or  represents  small  amounts  of  fil-
tered β2-microglobulin, apoproteins, enzymes, and peptide hormones. 
Another mechanism of proteinuria entails excessive production of an 
abnormal protein that exceeds the capacity of the tubule for reabsorp-
tion. This situation most commonly occurs with plasma cell dyscrasias, 
such as multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, and lymphomas, that are asso-
ciated with monoclonal production of immunoglobulin light chains.

The normal glomerular endothelial cell forms a barrier composed 
of pores of ~100 nm that retain blood cells but offer little impediment 
to passage of most proteins. The glomerular basement membrane traps 
most  large  proteins  (>100  kDa),  and  the  foot  processes  of  epithelial 
cells  (podocytes)  cover  the  urinary  side  of  the  glomerular  basement 
membrane and produce a series of narrow channels (slit diaphragms) 
to allow molecular passage of small solutes and water but not proteins. 
Some  glomerular  diseases,  such  as  minimal  change  disease,  cause 
fusion  of  glomerular  epithelial  cell  foot  processes,  resulting  in  pre-
dominantly “selective” (Fig. 52-3) loss of 
albumin.  Other  glomerular  diseases  can 
present with disruption of the basement 
membrane  and  slit  diaphragms  (e.g.,  by 
immune  complex  deposition),  resulting 
in  losses  of  albumin  and  other  plasma 
proteins.  The  fusion  of  foot  processes 
causes  increased  pressure  across  the 
capillary  basement  membrane,  result-
ing  in  areas  with  larger  pore  sizes  (and 
more  severe  “nonselective”  proteinuria)  
(Fig. 52-3).

FIGURE  52-3  Approach  to  the  patient  with  proteinuria.  Investigation  of  proteinuria  is  often  initiated  by  a  positive 
dipstick  on  routine  urinalysis.  Conventional  dipsticks  detect  predominantly  albumin  and  provide  a  semiquantitative 
assessment (trace, 1+, 2+, or 3+), which is influenced by urinary concentration as reflected by urine specific gravity 
(minimum, <1.005; maximum, 1.030). However, more exact determination of proteinuria should employ a spot morning 
protein/creatinine ratio (mg/g) or a 24-h urine collection (mg/24 h). FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; RBC, red 
blood cell; UPEP, urine protein electrophoresis.

When the total daily urinary excretion 
of  protein  is  >3.5  g,  hypoalbuminemia, 
hyperlipidemia,  and  edema  (nephrotic 
syndrome;  Fig.  52-3)  are  often  present 
as well. However, total daily urinary pro-
tein  excretion  >3.5  g  can  occur  without 
the  other  features  of  the  nephrotic  syn-
drome in a variety of other renal diseases, 
including  diabetes  (Fig.  52-3).  Plasma 
cell dyscrasias (multiple myeloma) can be 
associated with large amounts of excreted 
light  chains  in  the  urine,  which  may 
not  be  detected  by  dipstick.  The  light 
chains are filtered by the glomerulus and 
overwhelm  the  reabsorptive  capacity  of 
the  proximal  tubule.  Renal  failure  from 
these  disorders  occurs  through  a  vari-
ety  of  mechanisms,  including  but  not 
limited to proximal tubule injury, tubule 
obstruction (cast nephropathy), amyloid 
deposition,  and  light  chain  deposition 
(Chap. 316). The specific renal lesion is 
dictated  by  the  sequence  and  structural 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   336

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasescharacteristics of the monoclonal light chain; however, not all excreted 
light chains are nephrotoxic.

Hypoalbuminemia in nephrotic syndrome occurs through excessive 
urinary  losses  and  increased  proximal  tubule  catabolism  of  filtered 
albumin.  Edema  results  from  renal  sodium  retention  and  reduced 
plasma oncotic pressure, which favors fluid movement from capillaries 
to interstitium. To compensate for the perceived decrease in effective 
intravascular  volume,  activation  of  the  renin-angiotensin  system, 
stimulation of AVP, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system 
take place, promoting continued renal salt and water reabsorption and 
progressive edema. Filtered proteases, normally retained by the glom-
erular filtration barrier, can also directly activate sodium reabsorption 
by  the  epithelial  Na  channels  in  principal  cells  (ENaC)  in  nephrotic 
syndrome. Despite these changes, hypertension is uncommon in pri-
mary kidney diseases resulting in the nephrotic syndrome (Fig. 52-3 
and Chap. 314). The urinary loss of regulatory proteins and changes 
in  hepatic  synthesis  contribute  to  the  other  manifestations  of  the 
nephrotic syndrome. A hypercoagulable state may arise from urinary 
losses of antithrombin III, reduced serum levels of proteins S and C, 
hyperfibrinogenemia, and enhanced platelet aggregation. Hypercholes-
terolemia may be severe and results from increased hepatic lipoprotein 
synthesis. Loss of immunoglobulins contributes to an increased risk of 
infection. Many diseases (some listed in Fig. 52-3) and drugs can cause 
the nephrotic syndrome; a complete list is found in Chap. 314.

 ■ HEMATURIA, PYURIA, AND CASTS
Isolated  hematuria  without  proteinuria,  other  cells,  or  casts  is  often 
indicative of bleeding from the urinary tract. Hematuria is defined as 
two to five RBCs per high-power field (HPF) and can be detected by 
dipstick.  A  false-positive  dipstick  for  hematuria  (where  no  RBCs  are 
seen on urine microscopy) may occur when myoglobinuria is present, 
often  in  the  setting  of  rhabdomyolysis.  Common  causes  of  isolated 
hematuria include stones, neoplasms, tuberculosis, trauma, and pros-
tatitis. Gross hematuria with blood clots usually is not an intrinsic renal 
process; rather, it suggests a postrenal source in the urinary collecting 
system. Evaluation of patients presenting with microscopic hematuria 
is outlined in Fig. 52-2. A single urinalysis with hematuria is common 
and  can  result  from  menstruation,  viral  illness,  allergy,  exercise,  or 
mild  trauma.  Persistent  or  significant  hematuria  (>3  RBCs/HPF  on 
three  urinalyses,  a  single  urinalysis  with  >100  RBCs,  or  gross  hema-
turia) is associated with significant renal or urologic lesions in 9.1% of 
cases. The level of suspicion for urogenital neoplasms in patients with 
isolated painless hematuria and nondysmorphic RBCs increases with 
age. Neoplasms are rare in the pediatric population, and isolated hema-
turia is more likely to be “idiopathic” or associated with a congenital 
anomaly. Hematuria with pyuria and bacteriuria is typical of infection 
and should be treated with antibiotics after appropriate cultures. Acute 
cystitis or urethritis in women can cause gross hematuria. Hypercalci-
uria and hyperuricosuria are also risk factors for unexplained isolated 
hematuria  in  both  children  and  adults.  In  some  of  these  patients 
(50–60%),  reducing  calcium  and  uric  acid  excretion  through  dietary 
interventions can eliminate the microscopic hematuria.

Isolated microscopic hematuria can be a manifestation of glomer-
ular  diseases.  The  RBCs  of  glomerular  origin  are  often  dysmorphic 
when  examined  by  phase-contrast  microscopy.  Irregular  shapes  of 
RBCs  may  also  result  from  pH  and  osmolarity  changes  produced 
along the distal nephron. Observer variability in detecting dysmorphic 
RBCs is common. The most common etiologies of isolated glomerular 
hematuria  are  IgA  nephropathy,  hereditary  nephritis,  and  thin  base-
ment  membrane  disease.  IgA  nephropathy  and  hereditary  nephritis 
can lead to episodic gross hematuria. A family history of renal failure 
is  often  present  in  hereditary  nephritis,  and  patients  with  thin  base-
ment membrane disease often have family members with microscopic 
hematuria. A renal biopsy is needed for the definitive diagnosis of these 
disorders, which are discussed in more detail in Chap. 314. Hematuria 
with dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, and protein excretion >500 mg/d 
is virtually diagnostic of glomerulonephritis. RBC casts form as RBCs 
that enter the tubule fluid and become trapped in a cylindrical mold 
of  gelled  Tamm-Horsfall  protein.  Even  in  the  absence  of  azotemia, 

these patients should undergo serologic evaluation and renal biopsy as 
outlined in Fig. 52-2.

Isolated  pyuria  is  unusual  since  inflammatory  reactions  in  the 
kidney  or  collecting  system  also  are  associated  with  hematuria.  The 
presence of bacteria suggests infection, and WBC casts with bacteria 
are indicative of pyelonephritis; “sterile pyuria” with negative urinary 
bacterial cultures can be seen in urogenital tuberculosis. WBCs and/or 
WBC casts also may be seen in acute glomerulonephritis as well as in 
tubulointerstitial processes such as interstitial nephritis and transplant

Casts  can  be  seen  in  chronic  renal  diseases.  Degenerated  cellular 
casts called waxy casts or broad casts (arising in the dilated tubules that 
have  undergone  compensatory  hypertrophy  in  response  to  reduced 
renal mass) may be seen in the urine.

ABNORMALITIES OF URINE VOLUME
 ■ POLYURIA
By history, it is often difficult for patients to distinguish urinary frequency 
(often of small volumes) from true polyuria (>3 L/d), and a quantification 
of volume by 24-h urine collection may be needed (Fig. 52-4). Polyuria 
results  from  two  potential  mechanisms:  (1)  excretion  of  nonabsorb-
able solutes (such as glucose) or (2) excretion of water (usually from 
a  defect  in  AVP  production  or  renal  responsiveness).  To  distinguish 
a solute diuresis from a water diuresis and to determine whether the 
diuresis is appropriate for the clinical circumstances, urine osmolality 
is measured. The average person excretes between 600 and 800 mosmol 
of solutes per day, primarily as urea and electrolytes. If the urine output 
is >3 L/d and the urine is dilute (<250 mosmol/L), total osmolar excre-
tion is normal and a water diuresis is present. This circumstance could 
arise  from  polydipsia,  inadequate  secretion  of  AVP  (central  diabetes

insipidus), or failure of renal tubules to respond to AVP (nephrogenic 
diabetes insipidus). If the urine volume is >3 L/d and urine osmolality 
is >300 mosmol/L, a solute diuresis is clearly present and a search for 
the responsible solute(s) is mandatory.

Excessive filtration of a poorly reabsorbed solute such as glucose or 
mannitol can depress reabsorption of NaCl and water in the proximal 
tubule and lead to enhanced excretion in the urine. Poorly controlled 
diabetes mellitus with glucosuria is the most common cause of a sol-
ute  diuresis,  leading  to  volume  depletion  and  serum  hypertonicity. 
Since the urine sodium concentration is less than that of blood, more 
water  than  sodium  is  lost,  causing  hypernatremia  and  hypertonicity. 
Common  iatrogenic  solute  diuresis  occurs  in  association  with  man-
nitol  administration,  radiocontrast  media,  and  high-protein  feedings 
(enteral  or  parenteral),  leading  to  increased  urea  production  and 
excretion.  Less  commonly,  excessive  sodium  loss  may  result  from 
cystic  renal  diseases  or  Bartter’s  syndrome  or  may  develop  during  a 
tubulointerstitial  process  (such  as  resolving  ATN).  In  these  so-called 
salt-wasting disorders, the tubule damage results in direct impairment 
of  sodium  reabsorption  and  indirectly  reduces  the  responsiveness  of 
the tubule to aldosterone. Usually, the sodium losses are mild, and the 
obligatory urine output is <2 L/d; resolving ATN and postobstructive 
diuresis  are  exceptions  and  may  be  associated  with  significant  natri-
uresis and polyuria.

Formation of large volumes of dilute urine is usually due to poly-
dipsic states or diabetes insipidus. Primary polydipsia can result from 
habit, psychiatric disorders, neurologic lesions, or medications. During 
deliberate polydipsia, extracellular fluid volume is normal or expanded 
and plasma AVP levels are reduced because serum osmolality tends to 
be near the lower limits of normal. Urine osmolality is also maximally 
dilute at 50 mosmol/L.

Central diabetes insipidus may be idiopathic in origin or secondary 
to a variety of conditions, including hypophysectomy, trauma, neoplas-
tic, inflammatory, vascular, or infectious hypothalamic diseases. Idio-
pathic central diabetes insipidus is associated with selective destruction 
of  the  AVP-secreting  neurons  in  the  supraoptic  and  paraventricular 
nuclei and can either be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait or 
occur  spontaneously.  Nephrogenic  diabetes  insipidus  can  occur  in  a 
variety of clinical situations, as summarized in Fig. 52-4.

A plasma AVP level is recommended as the best method for distin-
guishing between central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Assays 
for  circulating  copeptin,  a  peptide  that  is  cleaved  from  pre-pro-AVP 
during axonal transport in the posterior pituitary, are also now avail-
able  in  many  centers.  A  water  deprivation  test  plus  exogenous  AVP 
may distinguish primary polydipsia from central and nephrogenic dia-
betes insipidus. Measurement of hypertonic saline–stimulated plasma 
copeptin, if available, can substitute for water deprivation testing. For 
a detailed discussion, see Chap. 381.

SODIUM AND WATER
 ■ COMPOSITION OF BODY FLUIDS
Water is the most abundant constituent in the body, comprising ~50% 
of body weight in women and 60% in men. Total-body water is distrib-
uted in two major compartments: 55–75% is intracellular (intracellular 
fluid  [ICF]),  and  25–45%  is  extracellular  (extracellular  fluid  [ECF]). 
The ECF is further subdivided into intravascular (plasma water) and 
extravascular  (interstitial)  spaces  in  a  ratio  of  1:3.  Fluid  movement 
between the intravascular and interstitial spaces occurs across the cap-
illary wall and is determined by Starling forces, i.e., capillary hydraulic 
pressure  and  colloid  osmotic  pressure.  The  transcapillary  hydraulic 
pressure  gradient  exceeds  the  corresponding  oncotic  pressure  gradi-
ent,  thereby  favoring  the  movement  of  plasma  ultrafiltrate  into  the 
extravascular space. The return of fluid into the intravascular compart-
ment occurs via lymphatic flow.

The solute or particle concentration of a fluid is known as its osmo-
lality, expressed as milliosmoles per kilogram of water (mOsm/kg). Water 
easily  diffuses  across  most  cell  membranes  to  achieve  osmotic  equi-
librium (ECF osmolality = ICF osmolality). Notably, the extracellular 
and intracellular solute compositions differ considerably owing to the 
activity of various transporters, channels, and ATP-driven membrane 
pumps. The major ECF particles are Na+ and its accompanying anions 
Cl– and HCO3
–, whereas K+ and organic phosphate esters (ATP, crea-
tine phosphate, and phospholipids) are the predominant ICF osmoles. 
Solutes that are restricted to the ECF or the ICF determine the “tonic-
ity” or effective osmolality of that compartment. Certain solutes, par-
ticularly urea, do not contribute to water shifts across most membranes 
and are thus known as ineffective osmoles.

Water  Balance  Vasopressin  secretion,  water  ingestion,  and  renal 
water transport collaborate to maintain human body fluid osmolality 
between  280  and  295  mOsm/kg.  Vasopressin  (AVP)  is  synthesized 
in  magnocellular  neurons  within  the  hypothalamus;  the  distal  axons 
of  these  neurons  project  to  the  posterior  pituitary  or  neurohypoph-
ysis,  from  which  AVP  is  released  into  the  circulation.  A  network  of 
central  “osmoreceptor”  neurons,  which  includes  the  AVP-expressing 
magnocellular  neurons  themselves,  sense  circulating  osmolality  via 
nonselective,  stretch-activated  cation  channels.  These  osmoreceptor 
neurons are activated or inhibited by modest increases and decreases 
in circulating osmolality, respectively; activation leads to AVP release 
and thirst.

AVP secretion is stimulated as systemic osmolality increases above 
a threshold level of ~285 mOsm/kg, above which there is a linear rela-
tionship  between  osmolality  and  circulating  AVP  (Fig.  53-1).  Thirst 
and thus water ingestion are also activated at ~285 mOsm/kg, beyond 
which there is an equivalent linear increase in the perceived intensity of 
thirst as a function of circulating osmolality. Changes in blood volume 
and blood pressure are also direct stimuli for AVP release and thirst, 
albeit with a less sensitive response profile. Of perhaps greater clinical 
relevance  to  the  pathophysiology  of  water  homeostasis,  ECF  volume 
strongly modulates the relationship between circulating osmolality and 
AVP release, such that hypovolemia reduces the osmotic threshold and 
increases the slope of the response curve to osmolality; hypervolemia 
has an opposite effect, increasing the osmotic threshold and reducing 
the slope of the response curve (Fig. 53-1). Notably, AVP has a half-life 
in  the  circulation  of  only  10–20  min;  thus,  changes  in  ECF  volume 
and/or circulating osmolality can rapidly affect water homeostasis. In 
addition  to  volume  status,  a  number  of  other  “nonosmotic”  stimuli 
have  potent  activating  effects  on  osmosensitive  neurons  and  AVP

by volume status. The osmotic threshold is thus slightly lower in hypovolemia, with 
a steeper response curve; hypervolemia reduces the sensitivity of circulating AVP

release, including nausea, intracerebral angiotensin II, serotonin, and 
multiple drugs.

The  excretion  or  retention  of  electrolyte-free  water  by  the  kidney  is 
modulated by circulating AVP. AVP acts on renal, V2-type receptors in the 
thick ascending limb of Henle and principal cells of the collecting duct 
(CD), increasing intracellular levels of cyclic AMP and activating pro-
tein kinase A (PKA)–dependent phosphorylation of multiple transport 
proteins. The AVP- and PKA-dependent activation of Na+-Cl– and K+ 
transport by the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TALH) is 
a  key  participant  in  the  countercurrent  mechanism  (Fig.  53-2).  The 
countercurrent mechanism ultimately increases the interstitial osmo-
lality  in  the  inner  medulla  of  the  kidney,  driving  water  absorption 
across the renal CD. However, water, salt, and solute transport by both 
proximal  and  distal  nephron  segments  participates  in  the  renal  con-
centrating  mechanism  (Fig.  53-2).  Water  transport  across  apical  and 
basolateral aquaporin-1 water channels in the descending thin limb of 
the loop of Henle is thus involved, as is passive absorption of Na+-Cl– by

Cortex

AVP-induced, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the aquaporin-2 
water channel in principal cells stimulates the insertion of active water 
channels into the lumen of the CD, resulting in transepi-
thelial water absorption down the medullary osmotic gra-
dient  (Fig.  53-3).  Under  “antidiuretic”  conditions,  with 
increased  circulating  AVP,  the  kidney  reabsorbs  water 
filtered  by  the  glomerulus,  equilibrating  the  osmolality 
across the CD epithelium to excrete a hypertonic, “con-
centrated” urine (osmolality of up to 1200 mOsm/kg). In 
the absence of circulating AVP, insertion of aquaporin-2 
channels and water absorption across the CD is essentially 
abolished,  resulting  in  secretion  of  a  hypotonic,  dilute 
urine (osmolality as low as 30–50 mOsm/kg). Abnormal-
ities in this “final common pathway” are involved in most 
disorders of water homeostasis, e.g., a reduced or absent 
insertion  of  active  aquaporin-2  water  channels  into  the 
membrane of principal cells in diabetes insipidus (DI).

Maintenance  of  Arterial  Circulatory  Integrity  
Sodium  is  actively  pumped  out  of  cells  by  the  Na+/
K+-ATPase membrane pump. In consequence, 85–90% of 
body Na+ is extracellular, and the ECF volume (ECFV) is 
a function of total-body Na+ content. Arterial perfusion 
and circulatory integrity are, in turn, determined by renal 
Na+ retention or excretion, in addition to the modulation 
of systemic arterial resistance. Within the kidney, Na+ is 
filtered by the glomeruli and then sequentially reabsorbed 
by  the  renal  tubules.  The  Na+  cation  is  typically  reab-
sorbed with the chloride anion (Cl–), and thus, chloride 
homeostasis  also  affects  the  ECFV.  On  a  quantitative 
level, at a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 180 L/d and

serum Na+ of ~140 mM, the kidney filters some 25,200 mmol/d of Na+. 
This is equivalent to ~1.5 kg of salt, which would occupy roughly 10 
times the extracellular space; 99.6% of filtered Na+-Cl– must be reab-
sorbed  to  excrete  100  mM  per  day.  Minute  changes  in  renal  Na+-Cl– 
excretion  will  thus  have  significant  effects  on  the  ECFV,  leading  to 
edema syndromes or hypovolemia.

Approximately  two-thirds  of  filtered  Na+-Cl–  is  reabsorbed  by  the 
renal proximal tubule, via both paracellular and transcellular mecha-
nisms. The TALH subsequently reabsorbs another 25–30% of filtered 
Na+-Cl– via the apical, furosemide-sensitive Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter. 
The  adjacent  aldosterone-sensitive  distal  nephron,  comprising  the 
distal  convoluted  tubule  (DCT),  connecting  tubule  (CNT),  and  CD, 
accomplishes the “fine-tuning” of renal Na+-Cl– excretion. The thiazide- 
sensitive  apical  Na+-Cl–  cotransporter  (NCC)  reabsorbs  5–10%  of 
filtered Na+-Cl– in the DCT. Principal cells in the CNT and CD reab-
sorb Na+ via electrogenic, amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels 
(ENaC);  Cl–  ions  are  primarily  reabsorbed  by  adjacent  intercalated 
cells, via apical Cl– exchange (Cl–-OH– and Cl–-HCO3
– exchange, medi-
ated by the SLC26A4 anion exchanger) (Fig. 53-4).

Renal tubular reabsorption of filtered Na+-Cl– is regulated by mul-
tiple circulating and paracrine hormones, in addition to the activity of 
renal nerves. Angiotensin II activates proximal Na+-Cl– reabsorption, 
as  do  adrenergic  receptors  under  the  influence  of  renal  sympathetic 
innervation; locally generated dopamine, in contrast, has a natriuretic 
effect.  Aldosterone  primarily  activates  Na+-Cl–  reabsorption  within 
the  aldosterone-sensitive  distal  nephron.  In  particular,  aldosterone 
activates the ENaC channel in principal cells, inducing Na+ absorption 
and promoting K+ excretion (Fig. 53-4).

Circulatory integrity is critical for the perfusion and function of vital 
organs. “Underfilling” of the arterial circulation is sensed by ventricular 
and vascular pressure receptors, resulting in a neurohumoral activation

increases  renal  Na+-Cl–  reabsorption,  vascular  resistance,  and  renal 
water  reabsorption.  This  occurs  in  the  context  of  decreased  cardiac 
output,  as  occurs  in  hypovolemic  states,  low-output  cardiac  failure, 
decreased  oncotic  pressure,  and/or  increased  capillary  permeability. 
Alternatively, excessive arterial vasodilation results in relative arterial 
underfilling,  leading  to  neurohumoral  activation  in  the  defense  of 
tissue  perfusion.  These  physiologic  responses  play  important  roles 
in many of the disorders discussed in this chapter. In particular, it is 
important  to  appreciate  that  AVP  functions  in  the  defense  of  circu-
latory  integrity,  inducing  vasoconstriction,  increasing  sympathetic 
nervous  system  tone,  increasing  renal  retention  of  both  water  and 
Na+-Cl–,  and  modulating  the  arterial  baroreceptor  reflex.  Most  of 
these responses involve activation of systemic V1A AVP receptors, but 
concomitant activation of V2 receptors in the kidney can result in renal 
water retention and hyponatremia.

 ■ HYPOVOLEMIA
Etiology  True  volume  depletion,  or  hypovolemia,  generally  refers 
to a state of combined salt and water loss, leading to contraction of the 
ECFV. The loss of salt and water may be renal or nonrenal in origin.

RENAL  CAUSES  Excessive  urinary  Na+-Cl–  and  water  loss  is  a  feature 
of  several  conditions.  A  high  filtered  load  of  endogenous  solutes,  such 
as  glucose  and  urea,  can  impair  tubular  reabsorption  of  Na+-Cl–  and 
water,  leading  to  an  osmotic  diuresis.  Exogenous  mannitol,  often  used 
to decrease intracerebral pressure, is filtered by glomeruli but not reab-
sorbed by the proximal tubule, thus causing an osmotic diuresis. Phar-
macologic  diuretics  selectively  impair  Na+-Cl–  reabsorption  at  specific 
sites along the nephron, leading to increased urinary Na+-Cl– excretion. 
Other drugs can induce natriuresis as a side effect. For example, acetazo-
lamide can inhibit proximal tubular Na+-Cl– absorption via its inhibition 
of carbonic anhydrase; other drugs, such as the antibiotics trimethoprim 
(TMP) and pentamidine, inhibit distal tubular Na+ reabsorption through 
the  amiloride-sensitive  ENaC  channel,  leading  to  urinary  Na+-Cl–  loss. 
Hereditary  defects  in  renal  transport  proteins  are  also  associated  with 
reduced reabsorption of filtered Na+-Cl– and/or water. Alternatively, min-
eralocorticoid  deficiency,  mineralocorticoid  resistance,  or  inhibition  of 
the mineralocorticoid receptor (MLR) can reduce Na+-Cl– reabsorption 
by  the  aldosterone-sensitive  distal  nephron.  Finally,  tubulointerstitial 
injury, as occurs in interstitial nephritis, acute tubular injury, or obstruc-
tive uropathy, can reduce distal tubular Na+-Cl– and/or water absorption.
Excessive  excretion  of  free  water,  i.e.,  water  without  electrolytes, 
can also lead to hypovolemia. However, the effect on ECFV is usually 
less marked, given that two-thirds of the water volume is lost from the 
ICF. Excessive renal water excretion occurs in the setting of decreased 
circulating AVP or renal resistance to AVP (central and nephrogenic 
DI, respectively).
EXTRARENAL CAUSES  Nonrenal causes of hypovolemia include fluid 
loss  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  skin,  and  respiratory  system. 
Accumulations of fluid within specific tissue compartments, typically 
the  interstitium,  peritoneum,  or  gastrointestinal  tract,  can  also  cause 
hypovolemia.

Approximately  9  L  of  fluid  enter  the  gastrointestinal  tract  daily, 
2  L  by  ingestion  and  7  L  by  secretion;  almost  98%  of  this  volume  is 
absorbed, such that daily fecal fluid loss is only 100–200 mL. Impaired 
gastrointestinal reabsorption or enhanced secretion of fluid can cause 
hypovolemia. Because gastric secretions have a low pH (high H+ con-
centration),  whereas  biliary,  pancreatic,  and  intestinal  secretions  are 
– concentration), vomiting and diarrhea are often 
alkaline (high HCO3
accompanied by metabolic alkalosis and acidosis, respectively.

Evaporation of water from the skin and respiratory tract (so-called 
“insensible  losses”)  constitutes  the  major  route  for  loss  of  solute-free 
water, which is typically 500–650 mL/d in healthy adults. This evapora-
tive loss can increase during febrile illness or prolonged heat exposure. 
Hyperventilation can also increase insensible losses via the respiratory 
tract,  particularly  in  ventilated  patients;  the  humidity  of  inspired  air

is another determining factor. In addition, increased exertion and/or 
ambient temperature will increase insensible losses via sweat, which is 
hypotonic to plasma. Profuse sweating without adequate repletion of 
water and Na+-Cl– can thus lead to both hypovolemia and hypertonic-
ity. Alternatively, replacement of these insensible losses with a surfeit 
of free water, without adequate replacement of electrolytes, may lead to 
hypovolemic hyponatremia.

Excessive fluid accumulation in interstitial and/or peritoneal spaces 
can  also  cause  intravascular  hypovolemia.  Increases  in  vascular  per-
meability and/or a reduction in oncotic pressure (hypoalbuminemia) 
alter Starling forces, resulting in excessive “third spacing” of the ECFV. 
This occurs in sepsis syndrome, burns, pancreatitis, nutritional hypo-
albuminemia,  and  peritonitis.  Alternatively,  distributive  hypovolemia 
can occur due to accumulation of fluid within specific compartments, 
for example, within the bowel lumen in gastrointestinal obstruction or 
ileus. Hypovolemia can also occur after extracorporeal hemorrhage or 
after significant hemorrhage into an expandable space, for example, the 
retroperitoneum.

Diagnostic  Evaluation  A  careful  history  will  usually  determine 
the etiologic cause of hypovolemia. Symptoms of hypovolemia are non-
specific  and  include  fatigue,  weakness,  thirst,  and  postural  dizziness; 
more severe symptoms and signs include oliguria, cyanosis, abdominal 
and  chest  pain,  and  confusion  or  obtundation.  Associated  electro-
lyte  disorders  may  cause  additional  symptoms,  for  example,  muscle 
weakness in patients with hypokalemia. On examination, diminished 
skin  turgor  and  dry  oral  mucous  membranes  are  less  than  ideal 
markers of a decreased ECFV in adult patients; more reliable signs of 
hypovolemia include a decreased jugular venous pressure (JVP), ortho-
static  tachycardia  (an  increase  of  >15–20  beats/min  upon  standing), 
and orthostatic hypotension (a >10–20 mmHg drop in blood pressure 
on standing). More severe fluid loss leads to hypovolemic shock, with 
hypotension, tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, and peripheral 
hypoperfusion;  these  patients  may  exhibit  peripheral  cyanosis,  cold 
extremities, oliguria, and altered mental status.

Routine chemistries may reveal an increase in blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN) and creatinine, reflective of a decrease in GFR. Creatinine is the 
more dependable measure of GFR, because BUN levels may be influ-
enced  by  an  increase  in  tubular  reabsorption  (“prerenal  azotemia”), 
an increase in urea generation in catabolic states, hyperalimentation, 
or  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  and/or  a  decreased  urea  generation  in 
decreased  protein  intake.  In  hypovolemic  shock,  liver  function  tests 
and  cardiac  biomarkers  may  show  evidence  of  hepatic  and  cardiac 
ischemia,  respectively.  Routine  chemistries  and/or  blood  gases  may 
reveal evidence of acid-base disorders. For example, bicarbonate loss 
due to diarrheal illness is a very common cause of metabolic acidosis; 
alternatively, patients with severe hypovolemic shock may develop lac-
tic acidosis with an elevated anion gap.

The neurohumoral response to hypovolemia stimulates an increase 
in renal tubular Na+ and water reabsorption. Therefore, the urine Na+ 
concentration is typically <20 mM in nonrenal causes of hypovolemia, 
with a urine osmolality of >450 mOsm/kg. The reduction in both GFR 
and distal tubular Na+ delivery may cause a defect in renal potassium 
excretion,  with  an  increase  in  plasma  K+  concentration.  Of  note, 
patients with hypovolemia and a hypochloremic alkalosis due to vomit-
ing, diarrhea, or diuretics will typically have a urine Na+ concentration 
–; 
>20 mM and urine pH of >7.0, due to the increase in filtered HCO3
the urine Cl– concentration in this setting is a more accurate indicator 
of volume status, with a level <25 mM suggestive of hypovolemia. The 
urine Na+ concentration is often >20 mM in patients with renal causes 
of hypovolemia, such as acute tubular necrosis; similarly, patients with 
DI will have an inappropriately dilute urine.

TREATMENT
Hypovolemia

The therapeutic goals in hypovolemia are to restore normovolemia 
and  replace  ongoing  fluid  losses.  Mild  hypovolemia  can  usu-
ally  be  treated  with  oral  hydration  and  resumption  of  a  normal 

maintenance  diet.  More  severe  hypovolemia  requires  intravenous 
hydration, tailoring the choice of solution to the underlying patho-
physiology.  Isotonic,  “normal”  saline  (0.9%  NaCl,  154  mM  Na+) 
is  the  most  appropriate  resuscitation  fluid  for  normonatremic  or 
hyponatremic  patients  with  severe  hypovolemia;  colloid  solutions 
such  as  intravenous  albumin  are  not  demonstrably  superior  for 
this  purpose.  Hypernatremic  patients  should  receive  a  hypotonic 
solution, 5% dextrose if there has only been water loss (as in DI), or 
hypotonic saline (1/2 or 1/4 normal saline) if there has been water 
and  Na+-Cl–  loss;  changes  in  free  water  administration  should  be 
made if necessary, based on frequent measuring of serum chemis-
tries. Patients with bicarbonate loss and metabolic acidosis, as occur 
frequently  in  diarrhea,  should  receive  intravenous  bicarbonate, 
– in 5% dextrose) 
either an isotonic solution (150 meq of Na+-HCO3
or  a  more  hypotonic  bicarbonate  solution  in  dextrose  or  dilute 
saline.  Patients  with  severe  hemorrhage  or  anemia  should  receive 
red  cell  transfusions,  without  increasing  the  hematocrit  beyond 
35%.

SODIUM DISORDERS
Disorders of serum Na+ concentration are caused by abnormalities in 
water  homeostasis,  leading  to  changes  in  the  relative  ratio  of  Na+  to 
body water. Water intake and circulating AVP constitute the two key 
effectors in the defense of serum osmolality; defects in one or both of 
these two defense mechanisms cause most cases of hyponatremia and 
hypernatremia. In contrast, abnormalities in sodium homeostasis per 
se  lead  to  a  deficit  or  surplus  of  whole-body  Na+-Cl–  content,  a  key 
determinant  of  the  ECFV  and  circulatory  integrity.  Notably,  volume 
status also modulates the release of AVP by the posterior pituitary, such 
that hypovolemia is associated with higher circulating levels of the hor-
mone  at  each  level  of  serum  osmolality.  Similarly,  in  “hypervolemic” 
causes of arterial underfilling, e.g., heart failure and cirrhosis, the asso-
ciated neurohumoral activation encompasses an increase in circulating 
AVP,  leading  to  water  retention  and  hyponatremia.  Therefore,  a  key 
concept in sodium disorders is that the absolute plasma Na+ concen-
tration  tells  one  nothing  about  the  volume  status  of  a  given  patient, 
which furthermore must be taken into account in the diagnostic and 
therapeutic approach.
 ■ HYPONATREMIA
Hyponatremia,  which  is  defined  as  a  plasma  Na+  concentration  
<135 mM, is a very common disorder, occurring in up to 22% of hospi-
talized patients. This disorder is almost always the result of an increase 
in circulating AVP and/or increased renal sensitivity to AVP, combined 
with an intake of free water; a notable exception is hyponatremia due 
to low solute intake (see below). The underlying pathophysiology for 
the  exaggerated  or  “inappropriate”  AVP  response  differs  in  patients 
with hyponatremia as a function of their ECFV. Hyponatremia is thus 
subdivided diagnostically into three groups, depending on clinical his-
tory and volume status, i.e., “hypovolemic,” “euvolemic,” and “hyper-
volemic” (Fig. 53-5).

Hypovolemic  Hyponatremia  Hypovolemia  causes  a  marked 
neurohumoral  activation,  increasing  circulating  levels  of  AVP.  The 
increase in circulating AVP helps preserve blood pressure via vascular 
and  baroreceptor  V1A  receptors  and  increases  water  reabsorption  via 
renal  V2  receptors;  activation  of  V2  receptors  can  lead  to  hypona-
tremia  in  the  setting  of  increased  free  water  intake.  Nonrenal  causes 
of hypovolemic hyponatremia include gastrointestinal loss (e.g., vom-
iting,  diarrhea,  tube  drainage)  and  insensible  loss  (sweating,  burns) 
of  Na+-Cl–  and  water,  in  the  absence  of  adequate  oral  replacement; 
urine Na+ concentration is typically <20 mM. Notably, these patients 
may  be  clinically  classified  as  euvolemic,  with  only  the  reduced  uri-
nary  Na+  concentration  to  indicate  the  cause  of  their  hyponatremia. 
Indeed, a urine Na+ concentration <20 mM, in the absence of a cause 
of hypervolemic hyponatremia, predicts a rapid increase in plasma Na+ 
concentration in response to intravenous normal saline; saline therapy 
thus induces a water diuresis in this setting, as circulating AVP levels 
plummet.

The  renal  causes  of  hypovolemic  hyponatremia  share  an  inappro-
priate  loss  of  Na+-Cl–  in  the  urine,  leading  to  volume  depletion  and 
an  increase  in  circulating  AVP;  urine  Na+  concentration  is  typically 
>20  mM  (Fig.  53-5).  A  deficiency  in  circulating  aldosterone  and/or 
its  renal  effects  can  lead  to  hyponatremia  in  primary  adrenal  insuf-
ficiency  and  other  causes  of  hypoaldosteronism;  hyperkalemia  and 
hyponatremia  in  a  hypotensive  and/or  hypovolemic  patient  with 
high  urine  Na+  concentration  (much  greater  than  20  mM)  should 
strongly suggest this diagnosis. Salt-losing nephropathies may lead to 
hyponatremia when sodium intake is reduced, due to impaired renal 
tubular function; typical causes include reflux nephropathy, interstitial 
nephropathies, postobstructive uropathy, medullary cystic disease, and 
the recovery phase of acute tubular necrosis. Thiazide diuretics cause 
hyponatremia via a number of mechanisms, including polydipsia and 
diuretic-induced  volume  depletion.  Notably,  thiazides  do  not  inhibit 
the renal concentrating mechanism, such that circulating AVP retains 
a full effect on renal water retention. In contrast, loop diuretics, which 
are less frequently associated with hyponatremia, inhibit Na+-Cl– and 
K+ absorption by the TALH, blunting the countercurrent mechanism 
and reducing the ability to concentrate the urine. Increased excretion 
of an osmotically active nonreabsorbable or poorly reabsorbable solute 
can also lead to volume depletion and hyponatremia; important causes 
include glycosuria, ketonuria (e.g., in starvation or in diabetic or alco-
holic ketoacidosis), and bicarbonaturia (e.g., in renal tubular acidosis 
or  metabolic  alkalosis,  where  the  associated  bicarbonaturia  leads  to 
loss of Na+).

Finally,  the  syndrome  of  “cerebral  salt  wasting”  is  a  rare  cause  of 
hypovolemic hyponatremia, encompassing hyponatremia with clinical 
hypovolemia  and  inappropriate  natriuresis  in  association  with  intra-
cranial  disease;  associated  disorders  include  subarachnoid  hemor-
rhage, traumatic brain injury, craniotomy, encephalitis, and meningitis. 
Distinction from the more common syndrome of inappropriate anti-
diuresis  (SIAD)  is  critical  because  cerebral  salt  wasting  will  typically 
respond to aggressive Na+-Cl– repletion.

Hypervolemic  Hyponatremia  Patients  with  hypervolemic 
hyponatremia  develop  an  increase  in  total-body  Na+-Cl–  that  is 
accompanied by a proportionately greater increase in total-body water, 
leading  to  a  reduced  plasma  Na+  concentration.  As  in  hypovolemic 
hyponatremia, the causative disorders can be separated by the effect on 
urine Na+ concentration, with acute or chronic renal failure uniquely 
associated  with  an  increase  in  urine  Na+  concentration  (Fig.  53-5). 

The pathophysiology of hyponatremia in the sodium-avid edematous 
disorders  (congestive  heart  failure  [CHF],  cirrhosis,  and  nephrotic 
syndrome) is similar to that in hypovolemic hyponatremia, except that 
arterial filling and circulatory integrity is decreased due to the specific 
etiologic factors (e.g., cardiac dysfunction in CHF, peripheral vasodi-
lation in cirrhosis). Urine Na+ concentration is typically very low, i.e., 
<10 mM, even after hydration with normal saline; this Na+-avid state 
may be obscured by diuretic therapy. The degree of hyponatremia pro-
vides an indirect index of the associated neurohumoral activation and 
is an important prognostic indicator in hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Euvolemic  Hyponatremia  Euvolemic  hyponatremia  can  occur 
in moderate to severe hypothyroidism, with correction after achieving 
a euthyroid state. Severe hyponatremia can also be a consequence of 
secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary disease; whereas the 
deficit  in  circulating  aldosterone  in  primary  adrenal  insufficiency 
causes  hypovolemic  hyponatremia,  the  predominant  glucocorticoid 
deficiency  in  secondary  adrenal  failure  is  associated  with  euvolemic 
hyponatremia.  Glucocorticoids  exert  a  negative  feedback  on  AVP 
release by the posterior pituitary such that hydrocortisone replacement 
in these patients can rapidly normalize the AVP response to osmolality, 
reducing circulating AVP.

The  SIAD  is  the  most  frequent  cause  of  euvolemic  hyponatremia 
(Table  53-1).  The  generation  of  hyponatremia  in  SIAD  requires  an 
intake of free water, with persistent intake at serum osmolalities that 
are  lower  than  the  usual  threshold  for  thirst;  as  one  would  expect, 
the osmotic threshold and osmotic response curves for the sensation 
of  thirst  are  shifted  downward  in  patients  with  SIAD.  Four  distinct 
patterns of AVP secretion have been recognized in patients with SIAD, 
independent for the most part of the underlying cause. Unregulated, 
erratic AVP secretion is seen in about a third of patients, with no obvi-
ous correlation between serum osmolality and circulating AVP levels. 
Other patients fail to suppress AVP secretion at lower serum osmolali-
ties, with a normal response curve to hyperosmolar conditions; others 
have a “reset osmostat,” with a lower threshold osmolality and a left-
shifted  osmotic  response  curve.  Finally,  the  fourth  subset  of  patients 
have essentially no detectable circulating AVP, suggesting either a gain 
in  function  in  renal  water  reabsorption  or  a  circulating  antidiuretic 
substance that is distinct from AVP. Gain-in-function mutations of a 
single specific residue in the V2 AVP receptor have been described in 
some of these patients, leading to constitutive activation of the receptor 
in the absence of AVP and “nephrogenic” SIAD.

Strictly speaking, patients with SIAD are not euvolemic but are sub-
clinically  volume-expanded,  due  to  AVP-induced  water  and  Na+-Cl– 
retention; “AVP escape” mechanisms invoked by sustained increases in 
AVP serve to limit distal renal tubular transport, preserving a modestly 
hypervolemic  steady  state.  Serum  uric  acid  is  often  low  (<4  mg/dL) 
in  patients  with  SIAD,  consistent  with  suppressed  proximal  tubular 
transport in the setting of increased distal tubular Na+-Cl– and water 
transport;  in  contrast,  patients  with  hypovolemic  hyponatremia  will 
often be hyperuricemic due to a shared activation of proximal tubular 
Na+-Cl– and urate transport.

Common causes of SIAD include pulmonary disease (e.g., pneumo-
nia, tuberculosis, pleural effusion) and central nervous system (CNS) 
diseases  (e.g.,  tumor,  subarachnoid  hemorrhage,  meningitis).  SIAD 
also  occurs  with  malignancies,  most  commonly  with  small-cell  lung 
carcinoma  (75%  of  malignancy-associated  SIAD);  ~10%  of  patients 
with this tumor will have a plasma Na+ concentration of <130 mM at 
presentation.  SIAD  is  also  a  frequent  complication  of  certain  drugs, 
most  commonly  the  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs). 
Other  drugs  can  potentiate  the  renal  effect  of  AVP,  without  exerting 
direct effects on circulating AVP levels (Table 53-1).

Low  Solute  Intake  and  Hyponatremia  Hyponatremia  can 
occasionally occur in patients with a very low intake of dietary solutes. 
Classically, this occurs in alcoholics whose sole nutrient is beer, hence 
the diagnostic label of beer potomania; beer is very low in protein and 
salt content, containing only 1–2 mM of Na+. The syndrome has also 
been  described  in  nonalcoholic  patients  with  highly  restricted  solute 
intake  due  to  nutrient-restricted  diets,  e.g.,  extreme  vegetarian  diets. 
Patients with hyponatremia due to low solute intake typically present 
with  a  very  low  urine  osmolality  (<100–200  mOsm/kg)  with  a  urine 
Na+ concentration that is <10–20 mM. The fundamental abnormality 
is the inadequate dietary intake of solutes; the reduced urinary solute 
excretion  limits  water  excretion  such  that  hyponatremia  ensues  after 
relatively  modest  polydipsia.  AVP  levels  have  not  been  reported  in 
patients  with  beer  potomania  but  are  expected  to  be  suppressed  or 
rapidly  suppressible  with  saline  hydration;  this  fits  with  the  overly 
rapid  correction  in  plasma  Na+  concentration  that  can  be  seen  with 
saline hydration. Resumption of a normal diet and/or saline hydration 
will also correct the causative deficit in urinary solute excretion, such 

that  patients  with  beer  potomania  typically  correct  their  plasma  Na+ 
concentration promptly after admission to the hospital.

Clinical Features of Hyponatremia  Hyponatremia induces gen-
eralized cellular swelling, a consequence of water movement down the 
osmotic gradient from the hypotonic ECF to the ICF. The symptoms of 
hyponatremia are primarily neurologic, reflecting the development of 
cerebral edema within a rigid skull. The initial CNS response to acute 
hyponatremia is an increase in interstitial pressure, leading to shunting 
of  ECF  and  solutes  from  the  interstitial  space  into  the  cerebrospinal 
fluid and then on into the systemic circulation. This is accompanied by 
an efflux of the major intracellular ions, Na+, K+, and Cl–, from brain 
cells. Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy ensues when these volume 
regulatory mechanisms are overwhelmed by a rapid decrease in tonic-
ity,  resulting  in  acute  cerebral  edema.  Early  symptoms  can  include 
nausea,  headache,  and  vomiting.  However,  severe  complications  can 
rapidly evolve, including seizure activity, brainstem herniation, coma, 
and death. A key complication of acute hyponatremia is normocapneic 
or hypercapneic respiratory failure; the associated hypoxia may amplify 
the neurologic injury. Normocapneic respiratory failure in this setting 
is  typically  due  to  noncardiogenic,  “neurogenic”  pulmonary  edema, 
with a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

Acute  symptomatic  hyponatremia  is  a  medical  emergency,  occur-
ring in a number of specific settings (Table 53-2). Women, particularly

before menopause, are much more likely than men to develop enceph-
alopathy  and  severe  neurologic  sequelae.  Acute  hyponatremia  often 
has an iatrogenic component, e.g., when hypotonic intravenous fluids 
are given to postoperative patients with an increase in circulating AVP. 
Exercise-associated hyponatremia, an important clinical issue at mar-
athons and other endurance events, has similarly been linked to both 
a  “nonosmotic”  increase  in  circulating  AVP  and  excessive  free  water 
intake. The recreational drugs Molly and Ecstasy, which share an active 
ingredient  (MDMA,  3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine),  cause  a 
rapid and potent induction of both thirst and AVP, leading to severe 
acute hyponatremia.

Persistent,  chronic  hyponatremia  results  in  an  efflux  of  organic 
osmolytes  (creatine,  betaine,  glutamate,  myoinositol,  and  taurine) 
from  brain  cells;  this  response  reduces  intracellular  osmolality  and 
the osmotic gradient favoring water entry. This reduction in intracel-
lular  osmolytes  is  largely  complete  within  48  h,  the  time  period  that 
clinically  defines  chronic  hyponatremia;  this  temporal  definition  has 
considerable relevance for the treatment of hyponatremia (see below). 
The cellular response to chronic hyponatremia does not fully protect 
patients  from  symptoms,  which  can  include  vomiting,  nausea,  con-
fusion,  and  seizures,  usually  at  plasma  Na+  concentration  <125  mM. 
Even patients who are judged “asymptomatic” can manifest subtle gait 
and  cognitive  defects  that  reverse  with  correction  of  hyponatremia; 
notably,  chronic  “asymptomatic”  hyponatremia  increases  the  risk  of 
falls.  Chronic  hyponatremia  also  increases  the  risk  of  bony  fractures 
owing to the associated neurologic dysfunction and to a hyponatremia- 
associated reduction in bone density. Therefore, every attempt should 
be made to safely correct the plasma Na+ concentration in patients with 
chronic hyponatremia, even in the absence of overt symptoms (see the 
section on treatment of hyponatremia below).

The  management  of  chronic  hyponatremia  is  complicated  sig-
nificantly  by  the  asymmetry  of  the  cellular  response  to  correction  of 
plasma  Na+  concentration.  Specifically,  the  reaccumulation  of  organic 
osmolytes  by  brain  cells  is  attenuated  and  delayed  as  osmolality 
increases  after  correction  of  hyponatremia,  sometimes  resulting  in 
degenerative  loss  of  oligodendrocytes  and  an  osmotic  demyelination 
syndrome (ODS). Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia (>8–10 mM  
in  24  h  or  18  mM  in  48  h)  causes  hypertonic  stress  in  astrocytes 
within  brain  regions  prone  to  ODS,  leading  to  generalized  protein 
ubiquitination  and  endoplasmic  reticulum  stress  due  to  activation  of 
the unfolded protein response; this is accompanied by apoptotic and 
autophagic cell death. Rapid correction of hyponatremia also causes a 
disruption in integrity of the blood-brain barrier, allowing the entry of 
immune mediators that may contribute to demyelination. The lesions 
of ODS classically affect the pons, a neuroanatomic structure wherein 
the  delay  in  the  reaccumulation  of  osmotic  osmolytes  is  particularly 
pronounced; clinically, patients with central pontine myelinolysis can 
present 1 or more days after overcorrection of hyponatremia with para-
paresis or quadriparesis, dysphagia, dysarthria, diplopia, a “locked-in 
syndrome,”  and/or  loss  of  consciousness.  Other  regions  of  the  brain 
can  also  be  involved  in  ODS,  most  commonly  in  association  with 
lesions of the pons but occasionally in isolation; in order of frequency, 
the lesions of extrapontine myelinolysis can occur in the cerebellum, 
lateral geniculate body, thalamus, putamen, and cerebral cortex or sub-
cortex. Clinical presentation of ODS can, therefore, vary as a function 
of  the  extent  and  localization  of  extrapontine  myelinolysis,  with  the 
reported development of ataxia, mutism, parkinsonism, dystonia, and 
catatonia. Relowering of plasma Na+ concentration after overly rapid 
correction can prevent or attenuate ODS (see the section on treatment 
of hyponatremia below). However, even appropriately slow correction 
can  be  associated  with  ODS,  particularly  in  patients  with  additional 
risk factors; these include alcoholism, malnutrition, hypokalemia, and 
liver transplantation.

Diagnostic  Evaluation  of  Hyponatremia  Clinical  assessment 
of  hyponatremic  patients  should  focus  on  the  underlying  cause;  a 
detailed drug history is particularly crucial (Table 53-1). A careful clin-
ical assessment of volume status is obligatory for the classical diagnos-
tic approach to hyponatremia (Fig. 53-5). Hyponatremia is frequently 

multifactorial,  particularly  when  severe;  clinical  evaluation  should 
consider all the possible causes for excessive circulating AVP, including 
volume status, drugs, and the presence of nausea and/or pain. Radio-
logic imaging may also be appropriate to assess whether patients have 
a pulmonary or CNS cause for hyponatremia. A screening chest x-ray 
may fail to detect a small-cell carcinoma of the lung; computed tomog-
raphy (CT) scanning of the thorax should be considered in patients at 
high risk for this tumor (e.g., patients with a smoking history).

Laboratory  investigation  should  include  a  measurement  of  serum 
osmolality  to  exclude  pseudohyponatremia,  which  is  defined  as  the 
coexistence  of  hyponatremia  with  a  normal  or  increased  plasma 
tonicity. Most clinical laboratories measure plasma Na+ concentration 
by  testing  diluted  samples  with  automated  ion-sensitive  electrodes, 
correcting for this dilution by assuming that plasma is 93% water. This 
correction  factor  can  be  inaccurate  in  patients  with  pseudohypona-
tremia  due  to  extreme  hyperlipidemia  and/or  hyperproteinemia,  in 
whom serum lipid or protein makes up a greater percentage of plasma 
volume.  The  measured  osmolality  should  also  be  converted  to  the 
effective osmolality (tonicity) by subtracting the measured concentra-
tion of urea (divided by 2.8, if in mg/dL); patients with hyponatremia 
have an effective osmolality of <275 mOsm/kg.

Elevated BUN and creatinine in routine chemistries can also indi-
cate renal dysfunction as a potential cause of hyponatremia, whereas 
hyperkalemia may suggest adrenal insufficiency or hypoaldosteronism. 
Serum glucose should also be measured; plasma Na+ concentration falls 
by ~1.6–2.4 mM for every 100-mg/dL increase in glucose, due to glu-
cose-induced water efflux from cells; this “true” hyponatremia resolves 
after  correction  of  hyperglycemia.  Measurement  of  serum  uric  acid 
should also be performed; whereas patients with SIAD-type physiology 
will  typically  be  hypouricemic  (serum  uric  acid  <4  mg/dL),  volume- 
depleted patients will often be hyperuricemic. In the appropriate clinical 
setting, thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary function should also be tested; 
hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal failure due to pituitary insuffi-
ciency are important causes of euvolemic hyponatremia, whereas pri-
mary adrenal failure causes hypovolemic hyponatremia. A cosyntropin 
stimulation test is necessary to assess for primary adrenal insufficiency.
Urine  electrolytes  and  osmolality  are  crucial  tests  in  the  initial 
evaluation  of  hyponatremia.  A  urine  Na+  concentration  <20–30  mM 
is consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia, in the clinical absence 
of  a  hypervolemic,  Na+-avid  syndrome  such  as  CHF  (Fig.  53-5).  In 
contrast,  patients  with  SIAD  will  typically  excrete  urine  with  an  Na+ 
concentration  that  is  >30  mM.  However,  there  can  be  substantial 
overlap in urine Na+ concentration values in patients with SIAD and 
hypovolemic  hyponatremia,  particularly  in  the  elderly;  the  ultimate 
“gold standard” for the diagnosis of hypovolemic hyponatremia is the 
demonstration that plasma Na+ concentration corrects after hydration 
with  normal  saline.  Patients  with  thiazide-associated  hyponatremia 
may also present with higher than expected urine Na+ concentration 
and  other  findings  suggestive  of  SIAD;  one  should  defer  making  a 
diagnosis of SIAD in these patients until 1–2 weeks after discontinuing 
the thiazide. A urine osmolality <100 mOsm/kg is suggestive of poly-
dipsia;  urine  osmolality  >400  mOsm/kg  indicates  that  AVP  excess  is 
playing a more dominant role, whereas intermediate values are more 
consistent with multifactorial pathophysiology (e.g., AVP excess with 
a  significant  component  of  polydipsia).  Patients  with  hyponatremia 
due to decreased solute intake (beer potomania) typically have urine 
Na+ concentration <20 mM and urine osmolality in the range of <100 
to  the  low  200s.  Finally,  the  measurement  of  urine  K+  concentration 
is required to calculate the urine-to-plasma electrolyte ratio, which is 
useful  to  predict  the  response  to  fluid  restriction  (see  the  section  on 
treatment of hyponatremia below).

TREATMENT
Hyponatremia

Three  major  considerations  guide  the  therapy  of  hyponatremia. 
First,  the  presence  and/or  severity  of  symptoms  determine  the 
urgency  and  goals  of  therapy.  Patients  with  acute  hyponatremia 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   344

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases(Table 53-2) present with symptoms that can range from headache, 
nausea, and/or vomiting, to seizures, obtundation, and central her-
niation; patients with chronic hyponatremia, present for >48 h, are 
less likely to have severe symptoms. Second, patients with chronic 
hyponatremia  are  at  risk  for  ODS  if  plasma  Na+  concentration  is 
corrected  by  >8–10  mM  within  the  first  24  h  and/or  by  >18  mM 
within the first 48 h. Third, the response to interventions such as 
hypertonic saline, isotonic saline, or AVP antagonists can be highly 
unpredictable,  such  that  frequent  monitoring  of  plasma  Na+  con-
centration during corrective therapy is imperative.

Once  the  urgency  in  correcting  the  plasma  Na+  concentration 
has been established and appropriate therapy instituted, the focus 
should  be  on  treatment  or  withdrawal  of  the  underlying  cause. 
Patients  with  euvolemic  hyponatremia  due  to  SIAD,  hypothy-
roidism,  or  secondary  adrenal  failure  will  respond  to  successful 
treatment of the underlying cause, with an increase in plasma Na+ 
concentration.  However,  not  all  causes  of  SIAD  are  immediately 
reversible,  necessitating  pharmacologic  therapy  to  increase  the 
plasma Na+ concentration (see below). Hypovolemic hyponatremia 
will respond to intravenous hydration with isotonic normal saline, 
with a rapid reduction in circulating AVP and a brisk water diuresis; 
it may be necessary to reduce the rate of correction if the history 
suggests that hyponatremia has been chronic, i.e., present for >48 h 
(see  below).  Hypervolemic  hyponatremia  due  to  CHF  will  often 
respond  to  improved  therapy  of  the  underlying  cardiomyopathy, 
e.g.,  following  the  institution  or  intensification  of  angiotensin- 
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. Finally, patients with hypona-
tremia due to beer potomania and low solute intake will respond 
very rapidly to intravenous saline and the resumption of a normal 
diet.  Notably,  patients  with  beer  potomania  have  a  very  high  risk 
of  developing  ODS,  due  to  the  associated  hypokalemia,  alcohol-
ism, malnutrition, and high risk of overcorrecting the plasma Na+ 
concentration.

Water deprivation has long been a cornerstone of the therapy of 
chronic hyponatremia. However, patients who are excreting mini-
mal  electrolyte-free  water  will  require  aggressive  fluid  restriction; 
this can be very difficult for patients with SIAD to tolerate, given 
that  their  thirst  is  also  inappropriately  stimulated.  The  urine-to-
plasma  electrolyte  ratio  (urinary  [Na+]  +  [K+]/plasma  [Na+])  can 
be exploited as a quick indicator of electrolyte-free water excretion 
(Table 53-3); patients with a ratio of >1 should be more aggressively 
restricted (<500 mL/d) if possible, those with a ratio of ~1 should 
be restricted to 500–700 mL/d, and those with a ratio <1 should be 
restricted  to  <1  L/d.  In  hypokalemic  patients,  potassium  replace-
ment  will  serve  to  increase  plasma  Na+  concentration,  given  that

the  plasma  Na+  concentration  is  a  function  of  both  exchangeable 
Na+ and exchangeable K+ divided by total-body water; a corollary is 
that aggressive repletion of K+ has the potential to overcorrect the 
plasma Na+ concentration even in the absence of hypertonic saline. 
Plasma Na+ concentration will also tend to respond to an increase 
in dietary solute intake, which increases the ability to excrete free 
water;  this  can  be  accomplished  with  oral  salt  tablets  and  with 
newly available, palatable preparations of oral urea.

Patients  in  whom  therapy  with  fluid  restriction,  potassium 
replacement, and/or increased solute intake fails may merit phar-
macologic  therapy  to  increase  their  plasma  Na+  concentration. 
Some  patients  with  SIAD  initially  respond  to  combined  therapy 
with  oral  furosemide,  20  mg  twice  a  day  (higher  doses  may  be 
necessary in renal insufficiency), and oral salt tablets; furosemide 
serves  to  inhibit  the  renal  countercurrent  mechanism  and  blunt 
urinary  concentrating  ability,  whereas  the  salt  tablets  counter-
act  diuretic-associated  natriuresis.  The  risk  of  hypokalemia  and/
or  renal  dysfunction  limits  enthusiasm  for  this  approach,  which 
requires careful titration of diuretic and salt tablets. Demeclocycline 
is a potent inhibitor of principal cells and can be used in patients 
whose Na levels do not increase in response to furosemide and salt 
tablets. However, this agent can be associated with a reduction in 
GFR,  due  to  excessive  natriuresis  and/or  direct  renal  toxicity;  it 
should  be  avoided  in  cirrhotic  patients  in  particular,  who  are  at 
higher  risk  of  nephrotoxicity  due  to  drug  accumulation.  If  avail-
able, palatable preparations of oral urea can also be used to manage 
SIAD, with comparable efficacy to AVP antagonists (vaptans); the 
increase in solute excretion with oral urea ingestion increases free 
water excretion, thus reducing the plasma Na+.

AVP  antagonists  (vaptans)  are  highly  effective  in  SIAD  and  in 
hypervolemic hyponatremia due to heart failure or cirrhosis, reli-
ably increasing plasma Na+ concentration due to their “aquaretic” 
effects (augmentation of free water clearance). Most of these agents 
specifically antagonize the V2 AVP receptor; tolvaptan is currently 
the  only  oral  V2  antagonist  to  be  approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and 
Drug  Administration.  Conivaptan,  the  only  available  intravenous 
vaptan, is a mixed V1A/V2 antagonist, with a modest risk of hypoten-
sion due to V1A receptor inhibition. Therapy with vaptans must be 
initiated in a hospital setting, with a liberalization of fluid restric-
tion  (>2  L/d)  and  close  monitoring  of  plasma  Na+  concentration. 
Although  approved  for  the  management  of  all  but  hypovolemic 
hyponatremia and acute hyponatremia, the clinical indications are 
limited.  Oral  tolvaptan  is  perhaps  most  appropriate  for  the  man-
agement of significant and persistent SIAD (e.g., in small-cell lung 
carcinoma) that has not responded to water restriction and/or oral 
furosemide  and  salt  tablets.  Abnormalities  in  liver  function  tests 
have been reported with chronic tolvaptan therapy; hence, the use 
of this agent should be restricted to <1–2 months.

Treatment  of  acute  symptomatic  hyponatremia  should  include 
hypertonic 3% saline (513 mM) to acutely increase plasma Na+ con-
centration by 1–2 mM/h to a total of 4–6 mM; this modest increase 
is  typically  sufficient  to  alleviate  severe  acute  symptoms,  after 
which  corrective  guidelines  for  chronic  hyponatremia  are  appro-
priate (see below). A bolus of 100 mL of hypertonic saline is more 
effective  than  an  infusion,  rapidly  improving  both  serum  sodium 
and  mental  status.  For  ongoing  infusions,  a  number  of  equations 
have  been  developed  to  estimate  the  required  rate  of  hypertonic 
saline,  which  has  an  Na+-Cl–  concentration  of  513  mM.  The  tra-
ditional  approach  is  to  calculate  an  Na+  deficit,  where  the  Na+ 
deficit = 0.6 × body weight × (target plasma Na+ concentration –  
starting plasma Na+ concentration), followed by a calculation of the 
required rate. Regardless of the method used to determine the rate 
of  administration,  the  increase  in  plasma  Na+  concentration  can 
be  highly  unpredictable  during  treatment  with  hypertonic  saline, 
due  to  rapid  changes  in  the  underlying  physiology;  plasma  Na+ 
concentration should be monitored every 2–4 h during treatment, 
with appropriate changes in therapy based on the observed rate of 
change.  The  administration  of  supplemental  oxygen  and  ventila-
tory  support  is  also  critical  in  acute  hyponatremia,  in  the  event

that  patients  develop  acute  pulmonary  edema  or  hypercapneic 
respiratory failure. Intravenous loop diuretics will help treat acute 
pulmonary  edema  and  will  also  increase  free  water  excretion,  by 
interfering  with  the  renal  countercurrent  multiplication  system. 
AVP antagonists do not have an approved role in the management 
of acute hyponatremia.

The rate of correction should be comparatively slow in chronic 
hyponatremia (<6-8 mM in the first 24 h and <6 mM each subse-
quent 24h), so as to avoid ODS; lower target rates are appropriate 
in patients at particular risk for ODS, such as alcoholics or hypoka-
lemic patients. Overcorrection of the plasma Na+ concentration can 
occur  when  AVP  levels  rapidly  normalize,  for  example,  following 
the treatment of patients with chronic hypovolemic hyponatremia 
with  intravenous  saline  or  following  glucocorticoid  replacement 
of  patients  with  hypopituitarism  and  secondary  adrenal  failure. 
Approximately  10%  of  patients  treated  with  vaptans  will  overcor-
rect;  the  risk  is  increased  if  water  intake  is  not  liberalized.  In  the 
event  that  the  plasma  Na+  concentration  overcorrects  following 
therapy,  be  it  with  hypertonic  saline,  isotonic  saline,  or  a  vaptan, 
hyponatremia can be safely reinduced or stabilized by the admin-
istration  of  the  AVP  agonist  desmopressin  acetate  (DDAVP)  and/
or the administration of free water, typically intravenous D5W; the 
goal is to prevent or reverse the development of ODS. Alternatively, 
the treatment of patients with marked hyponatremia can be initi-
ated  with  the  twice-daily  administration  of  DDAVP  to  maintain 
constant  AVP  bioactivity,  combined  with  the  administration  of 
hypertonic  saline  to  slowly  correct  the  serum  sodium  in  a  more 
controlled fashion, thus reducing upfront the risk of overcorrection.

 ■ HYPERNATREMIA
Etiology  Hypernatremia  is  defined  as  an  increase  in  the  plasma 
Na+  concentration  to  >145  mM.  Considerably  less  common  than 
hyponatremia, hypernatremia is nonetheless associated with mortality 
rates of as high as 40–60%, mostly due to the severity of the associated 
underlying disease processes. Hypernatremia is usually the result of a 
combined  water  and  electrolyte  deficit,  with  losses  of  H2O  in  excess 
of  Na+.  Less  frequently,  the  ingestion  or  iatrogenic  administration  of 
excess  Na+  can  be  causative,  for  example,  after  IV  administration  of 
excessive hypertonic Na+-Cl– or Na+-HCO3

Elderly  individuals  with  reduced  thirst  and/or  diminished  access 
to fluids are at the highest risk of developing hypernatremia. Patients 
with hypernatremia may rarely have a central defect in hypothalamic 
osmoreceptor  function,  with  a  mixture  of  both  decreased  thirst  and 
reduced AVP secretion. Causes of this adipsic DI include primary or 
metastatic tumor, occlusion or ligation of the anterior communicating 
artery, trauma, hydrocephalus, and inflammation.

Hypernatremia  can  develop  following  the  loss  of  water  via  both 
renal and nonrenal routes. Insensible losses of water may increase in 
the setting of fever, exercise, heat exposure, severe burns, or mechani-
cal ventilation. Diarrhea is, in turn, the most common gastrointestinal 
cause of hypernatremia. Notably, osmotic diarrhea and viral gastroen-
teritides  typically  generate  stools  with  Na+  and  K+  <100  mM,  thus 
leading to water loss and hypernatremia; in contrast, secretory diarrhea 
typically results in isotonic stool and thus hypovolemia with or without 
hypovolemic hyponatremia.

Common causes of renal water loss include osmotic diuresis second-
ary to hyperglycemia, excess urea, postobstructive diuresis, or mann-
itol; these disorders share an increase in urinary solute excretion and 
urinary osmolality (see “Diagnostic Approach,” below). Hypernatremia 
due to a water diuresis occurs in central or nephrogenic DI (NDI).

NDI is characterized by renal resistance to AVP, which can be partial 
or complete (see “Diagnostic Approach,” below). Genetic causes include 
loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked V2 receptor; mutations in the 
AVP-responsive aquaporin-2 water channel can cause autosomal reces-
sive and autosomal dominant NDI, whereas recessive deficiency of the 
aquaporin-1 water channel causes a more modest concentrating defect 
(Fig.  53-2).  Hypercalcemia  can  also  cause  polyuria  and  NDI;  calcium 
signals directly through the calcium-sensing receptor to downregulate 
Na+, K+, and Cl– transport by the TALH and water transport in prin-
cipal cells, thus reducing renal concentrating ability in hypercalcemia. 
Another common acquired cause of NDI is hypokalemia, which inhibits 
the renal response to AVP and downregulates aquaporin-2 expression. 
Several drugs can cause acquired NDI, in particular, lithium, ifosfamide, 
and  several  antiviral  agents.  Lithium  causes  NDI  by  multiple  mecha-
nisms,  including  direct  inhibition  of  renal  glycogen  synthase  kinase-3 
(GSK3), a kinase thought to be the pharmacologic target of lithium in 
bipolar disease; GSK3 is required for the response of principal cells to 
AVP. The entry of lithium through the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel 
ENaC (Fig. 53-4) is required for the effect of the drug on principal cells, 
such that combined therapy within lithium and amiloride can mitigate 
lithium-associated  NDI.  However,  lithium  causes  chronic  tubulointer-
stitial scarring and chronic kidney disease after prolonged therapy, such 
that  patients  may  have  a  persistent  NDI  long  after  stopping  the  drug, 
with a reduced therapeutic benefit from amiloride.

Finally, gestational DI is a rare complication of late-term pregnancy 
wherein increased activity of a circulating placental protease with “vaso-
pressinase” activity leads to reduced circulating AVP and polyuria, often 
accompanied by hypernatremia. DDAVP is an effective therapy for this 
syndrome, given its resistance to the vasopressinase enzyme.

Clinical Features  Hypernatremia increases osmolality of the ECF, 
generating  an  osmotic  gradient  between  the  ECF  and  ICF,  an  efflux 
of intracellular water, and cellular shrinkage. As in hyponatremia, the 
symptoms  of  hypernatremia  are  predominantly  neurologic.  Altered 
mental  status  is  the  most  frequent  manifestation,  ranging  from  mild 
confusion and lethargy to deep coma. The sudden shrinkage of brain 
cells in acute hypernatremia may lead to parenchymal or subarachnoid 
hemorrhages and/or subdural hematomas; however, these vascular com-
plications are primarily encountered in pediatric and neonatal patients. 
Rarely,  osmotic  demyelination  may  occur  in  acute  hypernatremia. 
Osmotic damage to muscle membranes can also lead to hypernatremic 
rhabdomyolysis. Brain cells accommodate to a chronic increase in ECF 
osmolality (>48 h) by activating membrane transporters that mediate 
influx  and  intracellular  accumulation  of  organic  osmolytes  (creatine, 
betaine, glutamate, myoinositol, and taurine); this results in an increase 
in  ICF  water  and  normalization  of  brain  parenchymal  volume.  In 
consequence,  patients  with  chronic  hypernatremia  are  less  likely  to 
develop severe neurologic compromise. However, the cellular response 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   346

21/01/22   3:38 PM

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesto chronic hypernatremia predisposes pediatric patients with hyperna-
tremia, particularly infants, to the development of cerebral edema and 
seizures during overly rapid hydration (overcorrection of plasma Na+ 
concentration  by  >10  mM/d).  In  critically  ill  adults,  however,  recent 
evidence  does  not  indicate  that  rapid  correction  of  hypernatremia  is 
associated  with  a  higher  risk  for  mortality,  seizure,  alteration  of  con-
sciousness,  and/or  cerebral  edema.  Given  that  restricting  the  rate  of 
correction to <10 mM/d has no physiologic sequelae, it seems prudent 
to restrict correction in adults to this rate; however, should that rate be 
exceeded, hypernatremia does not need to be reinduced.
Diagnostic Approach  The  history  should  focus  on  the  presence 
or  absence  of  thirst,  polyuria,  and/or  an  extrarenal  source  for  water 
loss,  such  as  diarrhea.  The  physical  examination  should  include  a 
detailed neurologic exam and an assessment of the ECFV; patients with 
a particularly large water deficit and/or a combined deficit in electro-
lytes and water may be hypovolemic, with reduced JVP and orthostasis. 
Accurate documentation of daily fluid intake and daily urine output is 
also critical for the diagnosis and management of hypernatremia.

Laboratory  investigation  should  include  a  measurement  of  serum 
and urine osmolality, in addition to urine electrolytes. The appropri-
ate response to hypernatremia and a serum osmolality >295 mOsm/kg 
is  an  increase  in  circulating  AVP  and  the  excretion  of  low  volumes  
(<500 mL/d) of maximally concentrated urine, i.e., urine with osmolal-
ity >800 mOsm/kg; should this be the case, then an extrarenal source of 
water loss is primarily responsible for the generation of hypernatremia. 
Many  patients  with  hypernatremia  are  polyuric;  should  an  osmotic 
diuresis  be  responsible,  with  excessive  excretion  of  Na+-Cl–,  glucose, 
and/or  urea,  then  daily  solute  excretion  will  be  >750–1000  mOsm/d 
(>15  mOsm/kg  body  water  per  day)  (Fig.  53-6).  More  commonly, 
patients  with  hypernatremia  and  polyuria  will  have  a  predominant 
water diuresis, with excessive excretion of hypotonic, dilute urine.

Adequate  differentiation  between  nephrogenic  and  central  causes 
of  DI  requires  the  measurement  of  the  response  in  urinary  osmolality 
to  DDAVP,  combined  with  measurement  of  circulating  AVP  in  the 
setting of hypertonicity. If measurement of serum copeptin is available, 
an  “indirect  water  deprivation”  test  can  be  performed  in  patients  with 
hypotonic polyuria without hypernatremia; if an infusion of hypertonic 
saline  increases  the  level  of  circulating  copeptin,  a  peptide  co-secreted 
with  AVP,  then  the  patient  suffers  from  polydipsia  rather  than  central 
DI. By definition, patients with baseline hypernatremia are hypertonic, 
with an adequate stimulus for AVP by the posterior pituitary. Therefore, 
in contrast to polyuric patients with a normal or reduced baseline plasma 
Na+ concentration and osmolality, a water deprivation test (Chap. 52) is 
unnecessary  in  hypernatremia;  indeed,  water  deprivation  is  absolutely 
contraindicated in this setting, given the risk for worsening the hyperna-
tremia. Hypernatremic patients with NDI will have high serum levels of 
AVP and copeptin. Their low urine osmolality will also fail to respond to 
DDAVP, increasing by <50% or <150 mOsm/kg from baseline; patients 
with central DI will respond to DDAVP, with a reduced circulating AVP 
and copeptin. Patients may exhibit a partial response to DDAVP, with a 
>50% rise in urine osmolality that nonetheless fails to reach 800 mOsm/
kg;  the  level  of  circulating  AVP  will  help  differentiate  the  underlying 
cause, i.e., NDI versus central DI. In pregnant patients, AVP assays should 
be drawn in tubes containing the protease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline 
to prevent in vitro degradation of AVP by placental vasopressinase.

For patients with hypernatremia due to renal loss of water, it is criti-
cal to quantify ongoing daily losses using the calculated electrolyte-free 
water clearance, in addition to calculation of the baseline water deficit 
(the relevant formulas are discussed in Table 53-3). This requires daily 
measurement of urine electrolytes, combined with accurate measure-
ment of daily urine volume.

TREATMENT
Hypernatremia

The  underlying  cause  of  hypernatremia  should  be  withdrawn  or 
corrected, be it drugs, hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, 
or  diarrhea.  The  approach  to  the  correction  of  hypernatremia  is

outlined  in  Table  53-3.  It  is  imperative  to  correct  hypernatremia 
slowly  to  avoid  cerebral  edema,  typically  replacing  the  calculated 
free water deficit over 48 h. Notably, the plasma Na+ concentration 
should  be  corrected  by  no  more  than  10  mM/d,  which  may  take 
longer than 48 h in patients with severe hypernatremia (>160 mM). 
A rare exception is patients with acute hypernatremia (<48 h) due 
to sodium loading, who can safely be corrected rapidly at a rate of 
1 mM/h.

Water  should  ideally  be  administered  by  mouth  or  by  nasoga-
stric tube, as the most direct way to provide free water, i.e., water 
without  electrolytes.  Alternatively,  patients  can  receive  free  water 
in  dextrose-containing  IV  solutions,  such  as  5%  dextrose  (D5W); 
blood glucose should be monitored in case hyperglycemia occurs. 
Depending on the history, blood pressure, or clinical volume status, 
it may be appropriate to initially treat with hypotonic saline solu-
tions (1/4 or 1/2 normal saline); normal saline is usually inappro-
priate in the absence of very severe hypernatremia, where normal 
saline is proportionally more hypotonic relative to plasma, or frank 
hypotension. Calculation of urinary electrolyte-free water clearance 
(Table 53-3) is required to estimate daily, ongoing loss of free water 
in  patients  with  NDI  or  central  DI,  which  should  be  replenished 
daily.

Additional  therapy  may  be  feasible  in  specific  cases.  Patients 
with  central  DI  should  respond  to  the  administration  of  intrave-
nous, intranasal, or oral DDAVP. Patients with NDI due to lithium 
may  reduce  their  polyuria  with  amiloride  (2.5–10  mg/d),  which 
decreases entry of lithium into principal cells by inhibiting ENaC 
(see  above);  in  practice,  however,  most  patients  with  lithium- 
associated DI are able to compensate for their polyuria by simply 
increasing their daily water intake. Thiazides may reduce polyuria 
due  to  NDI,  ostensibly  by  inducing  hypovolemia  and  increasing 
proximal  tubular  water  reabsorption.  Occasionally,  nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been used to treat polyu-
ria associated with NDI, reducing the negative effect of intrarenal 
prostaglandins  on  urinary  concentrating  mechanisms;  however, 
this  assumes  the  risks  of  NSAID-associated  gastric  and/or  renal 
toxicity.  Furthermore,  it  must  be  emphasized  that  thiazides,  ami-
loride, and NSAIDs are only appropriate for chronic management 
of polyuria from NDI and have no role in the acute management 
of  associated  hypernatremia,  where  the  focus  is  on  replacing  free 
water deficits and ongoing free water loss.

POTASSIUM DISORDERS
Homeostatic mechanisms maintain plasma K+ concentration between 
3.5  and  5.0  mM,  despite  marked  variation  in  dietary  K+  intake.  In  a 
healthy individual at steady state, the entire daily intake of potassium 
is excreted, ~90% in the urine and 10% in the stool; thus, the kidney 
plays  a  dominant  role  in  potassium  homeostasis.  However,  >98%  of 
total-body  potassium  is  intracellular,  chiefly  in  muscle;  buffering  of 
extracellular K+ by this large intracellular pool plays a crucial role in 
the  regulation  of  plasma  K+  concentration.  Changes  in  the  exchange 
and distribution of intra- and extracellular K+ can thus lead to marked 
hypo-  or  hyperkalemia.  A  corollary  is  that  massive  necrosis  and  the 
attendant release of tissue K+ can cause severe hyperkalemia, particu-
larly in the setting of acute kidney injury and reduced excretion of K+.
Changes  in  whole-body  K+  content  are  primarily  mediated  by  the 
kidney, which reabsorbs filtered K+ in hypokalemic, K+-deficient states 
and secretes K+ in hyperkalemic, K+-replete states. Although K+ is trans-
ported along the entire nephron, it is the principal cells of the connect-
ing segment (CNT) and cortical CD that play a dominant role in renal 
K+  secretion,  whereas  alpha-intercalated  cells  of  the  outer  medullary 
CD function in renal tubular reabsorption of filtered K+ in K+-deficient 
states.  In  principal  cells,  apical  Na+  entry  via  the  amiloride-sensitive 
ENaC  generates  a  lumen-negative  potential  difference,  which  drives 
passive K+ exit through apical K+ channels (Fig. 53-4). Two major K+ 
channels  mediate  distal  tubular  K+  secretion:  the  secretory  K+  chan-
nel  ROMK  (renal  outer  medullary  K+  channel;  also  known  as  Kir1.1 
or  KcnJ1)  and  the  flow-sensitive  “big  potassium”  (BK)  or  maxi-K

K+ channel. ROMK is thought to mediate the bulk of constitutive K+ 
secretion, whereas increases in distal flow rate and/or genetic absence 
of ROMK activate K+ secretion via the BK channel.

An appreciation of the relationship between ENaC-dependent Na+ 
entry  and  distal  K+  secretion  (Fig.  53-4)  is  required  for  the  bedside 
interpretation  of  potassium  disorders.  For  example,  decreased  distal 
delivery  of  Na+,  as  occurs  in  hypovolemic,  prerenal  states,  tends  to 
blunt the ability to excrete K+, leading to hyperkalemia; on the other 
hand, an increase in distal delivery of Na+ and distal flow rate, as occurs 
after treatment with thiazide and loop diuretics, can enhance K+ secre-
tion and lead to hypokalemia. Hyperkalemia is also a predictable con-
sequence of drugs that directly inhibit ENaC, due to the role of this Na+ 
channel in generating a lumen-negative potential difference. Aldoster-
one in turn has a major influence on potassium excretion, increasing 
the  activity  of  ENaC  channels  and  thus  amplifying  the  driving  force 
for  K+  secretion  across  the  luminal  membrane  of  principal  cells. 
Abnormalities  in  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system  can  thus 
cause  both  hypokalemia  and  hyperkalemia.  Notably,  however,  potas-
sium  excess  and  potassium  restriction  have  opposing,  aldosterone- 
independent effects on the density and activity of apical K+ channels 
in  the  distal  nephron,  i.e.,  factors  other  than  aldosterone  modulate 
the renal capacity to secrete K+. In addition, potassium restriction and 
hypokalemia  activate  aldosterone-independent  distal  reabsorption  of 
filtered K+, activating apical H+/K+-ATPase activity in intercalated cells 
within the outer medullary CD. Reflective perhaps of this physiology, 
changes in plasma K+ concentration are not universal in disorders asso-
ciated with changes in aldosterone activity.

 ■ HYPOKALEMIA
Hypokalemia,  defined  as  a  plasma  K+  concentration  of  <3.5  mM, 
occurs  in  up  to  20%  of  hospitalized  patients.  Hypokalemia  is  associ-
ated  with  a  tenfold  increase  in  in-hospital  mortality,  due  to  adverse 
effects  on  cardiac  rhythm,  blood  pressure,  and  cardiovascular  mor-
bidity.  Mechanistically,  hypokalemia  can  be  caused  by  redistribution 
of K+ between tissues and the ECF or by renal and nonrenal loss of K+  
(Table  53-4).  Systemic  hypomagnesemia  can  also  cause  treatment- 
resistant hypokalemia, due to a combination of reduced cellular uptake 
of  K+  and  exaggerated  renal  secretion.  Spurious  hypokalemia  or  
“pseudohypokalemia”  can  occasionally  result  from  in  vitro  cellular 
uptake of K+ after venipuncture, for example, due to profound leuko-
cytosis in acute leukemia.

Redistribution  and  Hypokalemia 
Insulin,  β2-adrenergic  activ-
ity, thyroid hormone, and alkalosis promote Na+/K+-ATPase-mediated 
cellular uptake of K+, leading to hypokalemia. Inhibition of the passive 
efflux  of  K+  can  also  cause  hypokalemia,  albeit  rarely;  this  typically 
occurs  in  the  setting  of  systemic  inhibition  of  K+  channels  by  toxic 
barium ions. Exogenous insulin can cause iatrogenic hypokalemia, par-
ticularly during the management of K+-deficient states such as diabetic 
ketoacidosis. Alternatively, the stimulation of endogenous insulin can 
provoke  hypokalemia,  hypomagnesemia,  and/or  hypophosphatemia 
in  malnourished  patients  given  a  carbohydrate  load.  Alterations  in 
the activity of the endogenous sympathetic nervous system can cause 
hypokalemia in several settings, including alcohol withdrawal, hyper-
thyroidism,  acute  myocardial  infarction,  and  severe  head  injury.  β2 
agonists, including both bronchodilators and tocolytics (ritodrine), are 
powerful activators of cellular K+ uptake; “hidden” sympathomimetics, 
such  as  pseudoephedrine  and  ephedrine  in  cough  syrup  or  dieting 
agents,  may  also  cause  unexpected  hypokalemia.  Finally,  xanthine- 
dependent  activation  of  cAMP-dependent  signaling,  downstream  of 
the β2 receptor, can lead to hypokalemia, usually in the setting of over-
dose (theophylline) or marked overingestion (dietary caffeine).

Redistributive hypokalemia can also occur in the setting of hyper-
thyroidism, with periodic attacks of hypokalemic paralysis (thyrotoxic 
periodic paralysis [TPP]). Similar episodes of hypokalemic weakness 
in the absence of thyroid abnormalities occur in familial hypokalemic 
periodic  paralysis,  usually  caused  by  missense  mutations  of  voltage 
sensor domains within the α1 subunit of L-type calcium channels or the 
skeletal Na+ channel; these mutations generate an abnormal gating pore

current activated by hyperpolarization. TPP develops more frequently 
in patients of Asian or Hispanic origin; this shared predisposition has 
been  linked  to  genetic  variation  in  Kir2.6,  a  muscle-specific,  thyroid 
hormone–responsive  K+  channel.  Genome-wide  association  studies 
have  also  implicated  variation  in  the  KCNJ2  gene,  which  encodes  a 
related muscle K+ channel, Kir 2.1, in predisposition to TPP. Patients 
with TPP typically present with weakness of the extremities and limb 
girdles,  with  paralytic  episodes  that  occur  most  frequently  between 
1 and 6 a.m. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism are not invari-
ably present. Hypokalemia is usually profound and almost invariably 
accompanied by hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia. The hypo-
kalemia in TPP is also attributed to both direct and indirect activation 
of the Na+/K+-ATPase, resulting in increased uptake of K+ by muscle

and  other  tissues.  Increases  in  β-adrenergic  activity  play  an  impor-
tant role in that high-dose propranolol (3 mg/kg) rapidly reverses the 
associated  hypokalemia,  hypophosphatemia,  and  paralysis.  Outward-
directed  inward-rectifying  K+  current,  mediated  by  KIR  channels 
(primarily  Kir2.1  and  Kir2.2  tetramers),  is  also  reduced  in  skeletal 
muscles of patients with TPP, providing an additional mechanism for 
hypokalemia.  Together  with  increased  Na+/K+-ATPase  activity  and 
increased circulating insulin, this reduced KIR current may trigger a 
“feedforward” cycle of hypokalemia leading to inactivation of muscle 
Na+ channels, paradoxical depolarization, and paralysis.
Nonrenal Loss of Potassium  The loss of K+ in sweat is typically 
low, except under extremes of physical exertion. Direct gastric losses of 
K+ due to vomiting or nasogastric suctioning are also minimal; how-
ever, the ensuing hypochloremic alkalosis results in persistent kaliuresis 
due to secondary hyperaldosteronism and bicarbonaturia, i.e., a renal 
loss of K+. Diarrhea is a globally important cause of hypokalemia, given 
the worldwide prevalence of infectious diarrheal disease. Noninfectious 
gastrointestinal  processes  such  as  celiac  disease,  ileostomy,  villous 
adenomas,  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  colonic  pseudo-obstruction 
(Ogilvie’s  syndrome),  VIPomas,  and  chronic  laxative  abuse  can  also 
cause  significant  hypokalemia;  an  exaggerated  intestinal  secretion  of 
potassium by upregulated colonic BK channels has been directly impli-
cated in the pathogenesis of hypokalemia in many of these disorders.

Renal Loss of Potassium  Drugs can increase renal K+ excretion 
by a variety of different mechanisms. Diuretics are a particularly com-
mon cause, due to associated increases in distal tubular Na+ delivery 
and distal tubular flow rate, in addition to secondary hyperaldostero-
nism. Thiazides have a greater effect on plasma K+ concentration than 
loop diuretics, despite their lesser natriuretic effect. The diuretic effect 
of  thiazides  is  largely  due  to  inhibition  of  the  Na+-Cl–  cotransporter 
NCC  in  DCT  cells.  This  leads  to  a  direct  increase  in  the  delivery  of 
luminal  Na+  to  the  principal  cells  immediately  downstream  in  the 
CNT and cortical CD, which augments Na+ entry via ENaC, increases 
the  lumen-negative  potential  difference,  and  amplifies  K+  secretion. 
The higher propensity of thiazides to cause hypokalemia may also be 
secondary  to  thiazide-associated  hypocalciuria,  versus  the  hypercal-
ciuria  seen  with  loop  diuretics;  the  increases  in  downstream  luminal 
calcium in response to loop diuretics inhibit ENaC in principal cells, 
thus  reducing  the  lumen-negative  potential  difference  and  attenuat-
ing  distal  K+  excretion.  High  doses  of  penicillin-related  antibiotics 
(nafcillin,  dicloxacillin,  ticarcillin,  oxacillin,  and  carbenicillin)  can 
increase obligatory K+ excretion by acting as nonreabsorbable anions 
in the distal nephron. Finally, several renal tubular toxins cause renal 
K+ and magnesium wasting, leading to hypokalemia and hypomagne-
semia; these drugs include aminoglycosides, amphotericin, foscarnet, 
cisplatin, and ifosfamide (see also “Magnesium Deficiency and Hypo-
kalemia,” below).

Aldosterone activates the ENaC channel in principal cells via mul-
tiple synergistic mechanisms, thus increasing the driving force for K+ 
excretion.  In  consequence,  increases  in  aldosterone  bioactivity  and/
or  gains  in  function  of  aldosterone-dependent  signaling  pathways 
are associated with hypokalemia. Increases in circulating aldosterone 
(hyperaldosteronism)  may  be  primary  or  secondary.  Increased  levels 
of circulating renin in secondary forms of hyperaldosteronism lead to 
increased angiotensin II and thus aldosterone; renal artery stenosis is 
perhaps the most frequent cause (Table 53-4). Primary hyperaldostero-
nism may be genetic or acquired. Hypertension and hypokalemia, due 
to  increases  in  circulating  11-deoxycorticosterone,  occur  in  patients 
with congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by defects in either steroid 
11β-hydroxylase or steroid 17α-hydroxylase; deficient 11β-hydroxylase 
results  in  associated  virilization  and  other  signs  of  androgen  excess, 
whereas  reduced  sex  steroids  in  17α-hydroxylase  deficiency  lead  to 
hypogonadism.

The  major  forms  of  isolated  primary  genetic  hyperaldostero-
nism  are  familial  hyperaldosteronism  type  I  (FH-I,  also  known  as  
glucocorticoid-remediable  hyperaldosteronism  [GRA])  and  familial 
hyperaldosteronism  types  II  and  III  (FH-II  and  FH-III),  in  which 
aldosterone production is not repressible by exogenous glucocorticoids. 

FH-I is caused by a chimeric gene duplication between the homologous 
11β-hydroxylase  (CYP11B1)  and  aldosterone  synthase  (CYP11B2) 
genes,  fusing  the  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH)–responsive 
11β-hydroxylase  promoter  to  the  coding  region  of  aldosterone  syn-
thase;  this  chimeric  gene  is  under  the  control  of  ACTH  and  thus 
repressible  by  glucocorticoids.  FH-III  is  caused  by  mutations  in  the 
KCNJ5  gene,  which  encodes  the  G  protein–activated  inward  rectifier 
K+  channel  4  (GIRK4);  these  mutations  lead  to  the  acquisition  of 
sodium permeability in the mutant GIRK4 channels, causing an exag-
gerated membrane depolarization in adrenal glomerulosa cells and the 
activation  of  voltage-gated  calcium  channels.  The  resulting  calcium 
influx is sufficient to produce aldosterone secretion and cell prolifera-
tion, leading to adrenal adenomas and hyperaldosteronism.

Acquired causes of primary hyperaldosteronism include aldosterone- 
producing  adenomas  (APAs),  primary  or  unilateral  adrenal  hyper-
plasia  (PAH),  idiopathic  hyperaldosteronism  (IHA)  due  to  bilateral 
adrenal hyperplasia, and adrenal carcinoma; APA and IHA account for 
close to 60% and 40%, respectively, of diagnosed hyperaldosteronism. 
Acquired somatic mutations in KCNJ5 or less frequently in the ATP1A1 
(an Na+/K+ ATPase α subunit) and ATP2B3 (a Ca2+ ATPase) genes can 
be detected in APAs; as in FH-III (see above), the exaggerated depo-
larization  of  adrenal  glomerulosa  cells  caused  by  these  mutations  is 
implicated  in  the  excessive  adrenal  proliferation  and  the  exaggerated 
release of aldosterone.

Random testing of plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone is 
a helpful screening tool in hypokalemic and/or hypertensive patients, 
with an aldosterone:PRA ratio of >50 suggestive of primary hyperal-
dosteronism.  Hypokalemia  and  multiple  antihypertensive  drugs  may 
alter the aldosterone:PRA ratio by suppressing aldosterone or increas-
ing PRA, leading to a ratio of <50 in patients who do in fact have pri-
mary hyperaldosteronism; therefore, the clinical context should always 
be considered when interpreting these results.

The glucocorticoid cortisol has equal affinity for the MLR to that of 
aldosterone,  with  resultant  “mineralocorticoid-like”  activity.  However, 
cells in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron are protected from this 
“illicit” activation by the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 
(11βHSD-2), which converts cortisol to cortisone; cortisone has min-
imal  affinity  for  the  MLR.  Recessive  loss-of-function  mutations  in 
the 11βHSD-2 gene are thus associated with cortisol-dependent acti-
vation  of  the  MLR  and  the  syndrome  of  apparent  mineralocorticoid 
excess  (SAME),  encompassing  hypertension,  hypokalemia,  hypercal-
ciuria, and metabolic alkalosis, with suppressed PRA and suppressed 
aldosterone. A similar syndrome is caused by biochemical inhibition 
of  11βHSD-2  by  glycyrrhetinic/glycyrrhizinic  acid  and/or  carbenox-
olone. Glycyrrhizinic acid is a natural sweetener found in licorice root, 
typically encountered in licorice and its many guises or as a flavoring 
agent  in  tobacco  and  food  products.  More  recently,  the  antifungals 
itraconazole and posaconazole have been shown to inhibit 11βHSD-2, 
leading to hypertension and hypokalemia.

Finally, hypokalemia may also occur with systemic increases in glu-
cocorticoids.  In  Cushing’s  syndrome  caused  by  increases  in  pituitary 
ACTH (Chap. 386), the incidence of hypokalemia is only 10%, whereas 
it  is  60–100%  in  patients  with  ectopic  secretion  of  ACTH,  despite  a 
similar incidence of hypertension. Indirect evidence suggests that the 
activity of renal 11βHSD-2 is reduced in patients with ectopic ACTH 
compared with Cushing’s syndrome, resulting in SAME.

Finally,  defects  in  multiple  renal  tubular  transport  pathways  are 
associated  with  hypokalemia.  For  example,  loss-of-function  muta-
tions  in  subunits  of  the  acidifying  H+-ATPase  in  alpha-intercalated 
cells  cause  hypokalemic  distal  renal  tubular  acidosis,  as  do  many 
acquired disorders of the distal nephron. Liddle’s syndrome is caused 
by autosomal dominant gain-in-function mutations of ENaC subunits. 
Disease-associated  mutations  either  activate  the  channel  directly  or 
abrogate  aldosterone-inhibited  retrieval  of  ENaC  subunits  from  the 
plasma membrane; the end result is increased expression of activated 
ENaC  channels  at  the  plasma  membrane  of  principal  cells.  Patients 
with  Liddle’s  syndrome  classically  manifest  severe  hypertension  with 
hypokalemia,  unresponsive  to  spironolactone  yet  sensitive  to  ami-
loride.  Hypertension  and  hypokalemia  are,  however,  variable  aspects 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   349

350

of the Liddle’s phenotype; more consistent features include a blunted 
aldosterone  response  to  ACTH  and  reduced  urinary  aldosterone 
excretion.

Loss of the transport functions of the TALH and DCT nephron seg-
ments causes hereditary hypokalemic alkalosis and Bartter’s syndrome 
(BS) and Gitelman’s syndrome (GS), respectively. Patients with classic 
BS typically suffer from polyuria and polydipsia, due to the reduction 
in renal concentrating ability. They may have an increase in urinary cal-
cium excretion, and 20% are hypomagnesemic. Other features include 
marked activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Patients 
with antenatal BS suffer from a severe systemic disorder characterized 
by  marked  electrolyte  wasting,  polyhydramnios,  and  hypercalciuria 
with nephrocalcinosis; renal prostaglandin synthesis and excretion are 
significantly increased, accounting for much of the systemic symptoms. 
There  are  five  disease  genes  for  BS,  all  of  them  functioning  in  some 
aspect of regulated Na+, K+, and Cl– transport by the TALH. In contrast, 
GS is genetically homogeneous, caused almost exclusively by loss-of-
function mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl– cotransporter of 
the DCT. Patients with GS are uniformly hypomagnesemic and exhibit 
marked hypocalciuria, rather than the hypercalciuria typically seen in 
BS; urinary calcium excretion is thus a critical diagnostic test in GS. GS 
is a milder phenotype than BS; however, patients with GS may suffer 
from chondrocalcinosis, an abnormal deposition of calcium pyrophos-
phate dihydrate (CPPD) in joint cartilage (Chap. 315).
Magnesium Deficiency and Hypokalemia  Magnesium  deple-
tion has inhibitory effects on muscle Na+/K+-ATPase activity, reducing 
influx into muscle cells and causing a secondary kaliuresis. In addition, 
magnesium  depletion  causes  exaggerated  K+  secretion  by  the  distal 
nephron;  this  effect  is  attributed  to  a  reduction  in  the  magnesium- 
dependent,  intracellular  block  of  K+  efflux  through  the  secretory  K+ 
channel of principal cells (ROMK; Fig. 53-4). In consequence, hypo-
magnesemic patients are clinically refractory to K+ replacement in the 
absence  of  Mg2+  repletion.  Notably,  magnesium  deficiency  is  also  a 
common concomitant of hypokalemia because many disorders of the 
distal  nephron  may  cause  both  potassium  and  magnesium  wasting 
(Chap. 315).
Clinical  Features  Hypokalemia  has  prominent  effects  on  car-
diac,  skeletal,  and  intestinal  muscle  cells.  In  particular,  hypokalemia 
is  a  major  risk  factor  for  both  ventricular  and  atrial  arrhythmias. 
Hypokalemia  predisposes  to  digoxin  toxicity  by  a  number  of  mech-
anisms,  including  reduced  competition  between  K+  and  digoxin  for 
shared  binding  sites  on  cardiac  Na+/K+-ATPase  subunits.  Electrocar-
diographic  changes  in  hypokalemia  include  broad  flat  T  waves,  ST 
depression, and QT prolongation; these are most marked when serum 
K+ is <2.7 mmol/L. Hypokalemia can thus be an important precipitant  
of  arrhythmia  in  patients  with  additional  genetic  or  acquired  causes 
of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia also results in hyperpolarization of 
skeletal muscle, thus impairing the capacity to depolarize and contract; 
weakness and even paralysis may ensue. It also causes a skeletal myo-
pathy and predisposes to rhabdomyolysis. Finally, the paralytic effects 
of hypokalemia on intestinal smooth muscle may cause intestinal ileus.
The  functional  effects  of  hypokalemia  on  the  kidney  can  include 
Na+-Cl– and HCO3
– retention, polyuria, phosphaturia, hypocitraturia, 
and an activation of renal ammoniagenesis. Bicarbonate retention and 
other acid-base effects of hypokalemia can contribute to the generation 
of metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemic polyuria is due to a combination 
of central polydipsia and an AVP-resistant renal concentrating defect. 
Structural  changes  in  the  kidney  due  to  hypokalemia  include  a  rela-
tively specific vacuolizing injury to proximal tubular cells, interstitial 
nephritis, and renal cysts. Hypokalemia also predisposes to acute kid-
ney injury and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients 
with long-standing hypokalemia due to eating disorders and/or laxa-
tive abuse.

Hypokalemia and/or reduced dietary K+ are implicated in the patho-
physiology  and  progression  of  hypertension,  heart  failure,  vascular 
disease, and stroke. For example, short-term K+ restriction in healthy 
humans  and  patients  with  essential  hypertension  induces  Na+-Cl– 
retention and hypertension. Correction of hypokalemia is particularly 

important  in  hypertensive  patients  treated  with  diuretics,  in  whom 
blood  pressure  improves  with  potassium  supplementation  and  the 
establishment of normokalemia.
Diagnostic  Approach  The  cause  of  hypokalemia  is  usually  evi-
dent from history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests. 
The  history  should  focus  on  medications  (e.g.,  laxatives,  diuretics, 
antibiotics),  diet  and  dietary  habits  (e.g.,  licorice),  and/or  symptoms 
that suggest a particular cause (e.g., periodic weakness, diarrhea). The 
physical examination should pay particular attention to blood pressure, 
volume status, and signs suggestive of specific hypokalemic disorders, 
e.g., hyperthyroidism and Cushing’s syndrome. Initial laboratory eval-
uation should include electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, serum osmolality, 
Mg2+, Ca2+, a complete blood count, and urinary pH, osmolality, crea-
tinine, and electrolytes (Fig. 53-7). The presence of a non–anion gap 
acidosis suggests a distal, hypokalemic renal tubular acidosis or diar-
rhea; calculation of the urinary anion gap can help differentiate these 
two diagnoses. Renal K+ excretion can be assessed with a 24-h urine 
collection; a 24-h K+ excretion of <15 mmol is indicative of an extrare-
nal  cause  of  hypokalemia  (Fig.  53-7).  If  only  a  random,  spot  urine 
sample is available, serum and urine osmolality can be used to calculate 
the transtubular K+ gradient (TTKG), which should be <3 in the pres-
ence of hypokalemia (see also “Hyperkalemia”). Alternatively, a urinary 
K+-to-creatinine  ratio  of  >13  mmol/g  creatinine  (>1.5  mmol/mmol 
creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. Urine Cl– is 
usually decreased in patients with hypokalemia from a nonreabsorb-
–.  The  most  common  causes 
able  anion,  such  as  antibiotics  or  HCO3
of  chronic  hypokalemic  alkalosis  are  surreptitious  vomiting,  diuretic 
abuse,  and  GS;  these  can  be  distinguished  by  the  pattern  of  urinary 
electrolytes. Hypokalemic patients with vomiting due to bulimia will 
thus typically have a urinary Cl– <10 mmol/L; urine Na+, K+, and Cl– 
are persistently elevated in GS, due to loss of function in the thiazide-
sensitive Na+-Cl– cotransporter, but less elevated in diuretic abuse and 
with  greater  variability.  Urine  diuretic  screens  for  loop  diuretics  and 
thiazides may be necessary to further exclude diuretic abuse.

Other  tests,  such  as  urinary  Ca2+,  thyroid  function  tests,  and/or 
PRA and aldosterone levels, may also be appropriate in specific cases. 
A plasma aldosterone:PRA ratio of >50, due to suppression of circu-
lating renin and an elevation of circulating aldosterone, is suggestive 
of hyperaldosteronism. Patients with hyperaldosteronism or apparent 
mineralocorticoid  excess  may  require  further  testing,  for  example, 
adrenal vein sampling (Chap. 386) or the clinically available testing for 
specific genetic causes (e.g., FH-I, SAME, Liddle’s syndrome). Patients 
with  primary  aldosteronism  should  thus  be  tested  for  the  chimeric 
FH-I/GRA gene (see above) if they are younger than 20 years of age 
or have a family history of primary aldosteronism or stroke at a young 
age (<40 years). Preliminary differentiation of Liddle’s syndrome due 
to  mutant  ENaC  channels  from  SAME  due  to  mutant  11βHSD-2 
(see above), both of which cause hypokalemia and hypertension with 
aldosterone  suppression,  can  be  made  on  a  clinical  basis  and  then 
confirmed by genetic analysis; patients with Liddle’s syndrome should 
respond  to  amiloride  (ENaC  inhibition)  but  not  spironolactone, 
whereas patients with SAME will respond to spironolactone.

TREATMENT
Hypokalemia

The goals of therapy in hypokalemia are to prevent life-threatening 
and/or serious chronic consequences, to replace the associated K+ 
deficit, and to correct the underlying cause and/or mitigate future 
hypokalemia.  The  urgency  of  therapy  depends  on  the  severity 
of  hypokalemia,  associated  clinical  factors  (e.g.,  cardiac  disease, 
digoxin therapy), and the rate of decline in serum K+. Patients with 
a  prolonged  QT  interval  and/or  other  risk  factors  for  arrhythmia 
should be monitored by continuous cardiac telemetry during reple-
tion. Urgent but cautious K+ replacement should be considered in 
patients with severe redistributive hypokalemia (plasma K+ concen-
tration <2.5 mM) and/or when serious complications ensue; how-
ever,  this  approach  has  a  risk  of  rebound  hyperkalemia  following

acute resolution of the underlying cause. When excessive activity of 
the sympathetic nervous system is thought to play a dominant role 
in  redistributive  hypokalemia,  as  in  TPP,  theophylline  overdose, 
and acute head injury, high-dose propranolol (3 mg/kg) should be 
considered; this nonspecific β-adrenergic blocker will correct hypo-
kalemia without the risk of rebound hyperkalemia.

Oral  replacement  with  K+-Cl–  is  the  mainstay  of  therapy  in 
hypokalemia. Potassium phosphate, oral or IV, may be appropriate 
in  patients  with  combined  hypokalemia  and  hypophosphatemia. 
Potassium bicarbonate or potassium citrate should be considered in 
patients  with  concomitant  metabolic  acidosis.  Notably,  hypomag-
nesemic patients are refractory to K+ replacement alone, such that 
concomitant Mg2+ deficiency should always be corrected with oral 
or intravenous repletion. The deficit of K+ and the rate of correc-
tion should be estimated as accurately as possible; renal function, 
medications,  and  comorbid  conditions  such  as  diabetes  should 

also be considered, so as to gauge the risk of overcorrection. In the 
absence  of  abnormal  K+  redistribution,  the  total  deficit  correlates 
with serum K+, such that serum K+ drops by ~0.27 mM for every 
100-mmol reduction in total-body stores; loss of 400–800 mmol of 
total-body K+ results in a reduction in serum K+ by ~2.0 mM. Nota-
bly,  given  the  delay  in  redistributing  potassium  into  intracellular 
compartments, this deficit must be replaced gradually over 24–48 h,  
with frequent monitoring of plasma K+ concentration to avoid tran-
sient overrepletion and transient hyperkalemia.

The  use  of  intravenous  administration  should  be  limited  to 
patients unable to use the enteral route or in the setting of severe 
complications  (e.g.,  paralysis,  arrhythmia).  Intravenous  K+-Cl– 
should  always  be  administered  in  saline  solutions,  rather  than 
dextrose,  because  the  dextrose-induced  increase  in  insulin  can 
acutely  exacerbate  hypokalemia.  The  peripheral  intravenous  dose 
is  usually  20–40  mmol  of  K+-Cl–  per  liter;  higher  concentrations

can  cause  localized  pain  from  chemical  phlebitis,  irritation,  and 
sclerosis. If hypokalemia is severe (<2.5 mmol/L) and/or critically 
symptomatic,  intravenous  K+-Cl–  can  be  administered  through  a 
central vein with cardiac monitoring in an intensive care setting, at 
rates of 10–20 mmol/h; higher rates should be reserved for acutely 
life-threatening  complications.  The  absolute  amount  of  adminis-
tered  K+  should  be  restricted  (e.g.,  20  mmol  in  100  mL  of  saline 
solution) to prevent inadvertent infusion of a large dose.

Strategies to minimize K+ losses should also be considered. These 
measures  may  include  minimizing  the  dose  of  non-K+-sparing 
diuretics,  restricting  Na+  intake,  and  using  clinically  appropriate 
combinations of non-K+-sparing and K+-sparing medications (e.g., 
loop diuretics with ACE inhibitors).

 ■ HYPERKALEMIA
Hyperkalemia  is  defined  as  a  plasma  potassium  level  of  5.5  mM, 
occurring in up to 10% of hospitalized patients; severe hyperkalemia  
(>6.0 mM) occurs in ~1%, with a significantly increased risk of mor-
tality.  Although  redistribution  and  reduced  tissue  uptake  can  acutely 
cause hyperkalemia, a decrease in renal K+ excretion is the most fre-
quent underlying cause (Table 53-5). Excessive intake of K+ is a rare 
cause, given the adaptive capacity to increase renal secretion; however, 
dietary  intake  can  have  a  major  effect  in  susceptible  patients,  e.g., 
diabetics with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and chronic kidney 
disease. Drugs that impact on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis 
are also a major cause of hyperkalemia.

Pseudohyperkalemia  Hyperkalemia  should  be  distinguished 
from factitious hyperkalemia or “pseudohyperkalemia,” an artifactual 
increase in serum K+ due to the release of K+ during or after venipunc-
ture. Pseudohyperkalemia can occur in the setting of excessive muscle 
activity  during  venipuncture  (e.g.,  fist  clenching),  a  marked  increase 
in cellular elements (thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and/or erythrocy-
tosis) with in vitro efflux of K+, and acute anxiety during venipuncture 
with respiratory alkalosis and redistributive hyperkalemia. Cooling of 
blood following venipuncture is another cause, due to reduced cellular 
uptake; the converse is the increased uptake of K+ by cells at high ambi-
ent temperatures, leading to normal values for hyperkalemic patients 
and/or  to  spurious  hypokalemia  in  normokalemic  patients.  Finally, 
there are multiple genetic subtypes of hereditary pseudohyperkalemia, 
caused by increases in the passive K+ permeability of erythrocytes. For 
example, causative mutations have been described in the red cell anion 
exchanger (AE1, encoded by the SLC4A1 gene), leading to reduced red 
cell anion transport, hemolytic anemia, the acquisition of a novel AE1-
mediated K+ leak, and pseudohyperkalemia.

Redistribution  and  Hyperkalemia  Several  different  mecha-
nisms  can  induce  an  efflux  of  intracellular  K+  and  hyperkalemia. 
Acidemia  is  associated  with  cellular  uptake  of  H+  and  an  associated 
efflux of K+; it is thought that this effective K+-H+ exchange serves to 
help maintain extracellular pH. Notably, this effect of acidosis is limited 
to non–anion gap causes of metabolic acidosis and, to a lesser extent, 
respiratory  causes  of  acidosis;  hyperkalemia  due  to  an  acidosis-in-
duced shift of potassium from the cells into the ECF does  not occur 
in  the  anion  gap  acidoses  lactic  acidosis  and  ketoacidosis.  Hyperka-
lemia due to hypertonic mannitol, hypertonic saline, and intravenous 
immune  globulin  is  generally  attributed  to  a  “solvent  drag”  effect,  as 
water moves out of cells along the osmotic gradient. Diabetics are also 
prone to osmotic hyperkalemia in response to intravenous hypertonic 
glucose, when given without adequate insulin. Cationic amino acids, 
specifically  lysine,  arginine,  and  the  structurally  related  drug  epsi-
lon-aminocaproic acid, cause efflux of K+ and hyperkalemia, through 
an effective cation-K+ exchange of unknown identity and mechanism. 
Digoxin inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase and impairs the uptake of K+ by skel-
etal muscle, such that digoxin overdose predictably results in hyperka-
lemia. Structurally related glycosides are found in specific plants (e.g., 
yellow oleander, foxglove) and in the cane toad, Bufo marinus (bufa-
dienolide); ingestion of these substances and extracts thereof can also

cause hyperkalemia. Finally, fluoride ions also inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase, 
such that fluoride poisoning is typically associated with hyperkalemia.
Succinylcholine  depolarizes  muscle  cells,  causing  an  efflux  of  K+ 
through acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). The use of this agent is con-
traindicated in patients who have sustained thermal trauma, neuromus-
cular  injury,  disuse  atrophy,  mucositis,  or  prolonged  immobilization.

These disorders share a marked increase and redistribution of AChRs 
at the plasma membrane of muscle cells; depolarization of these upreg-
ulated AChRs by succinylcholine leads to an exaggerated efflux of K+ 
through  the  receptor-associated  cation  channels,  resulting  in  acute 
hyperkalemia.

Hyperkalemia  Caused  by  Excess  Intake  or  Tissue  Necrosis  
Increased  intake  of  even  small  amounts  of  K+  may  provoke  severe 
hyperkalemia in patients with predisposing factors; hence, an assess-
ment  of  dietary  intake  is  crucial.  Foods  rich  in  potassium  include 
tomatoes,  bananas,  and  citrus  fruits;  occult  sources  of  K+,  particu-
larly  K+-containing  salt  substitutes,  may  also  contribute  significantly. 
Iatrogenic  causes  include  simple  overreplacement  with  K+-Cl–  or 
the  administration  of  a  potassium-containing  medication  (e.g.,  K+- 
penicillin)  to  a  susceptible  patient.  Red  cell  transfusion  is  a  well-
described  cause  of  hyperkalemia,  typically  in  the  setting  of  massive 
transfusions. Finally, severe tissue necrosis, as in acute tumor lysis syn-
drome and rhabdomyolysis, will predictably cause hyperkalemia from 
the release of intracellular K+.

Hypoaldosteronism  and  Hyperkalemia  Aldosterone  release 
from  the  adrenal  gland  may  be  reduced  by  hyporeninemic  hypoal-
dosteronism,  medications,  primary  hypoaldosteronism,  or  isolated 
deficiency of ACTH (secondary hypoaldosteronism). Primary hypoal-
dosteronism may be genetic or acquired (Chap. 386) but is commonly 
caused by autoimmunity, either in Addison’s disease or in the context 
of  a  polyglandular  endocrinopathy.  HIV  has  surpassed  tuberculosis 
as  the  most  important  infectious  cause  of  adrenal  insufficiency.  The 
adrenal  involvement  in  HIV  disease  is  usually  subclinical;  however, 
adrenal  insufficiency  may  be  precipitated  by  stress,  drugs  such  as 
ketoconazole  that  inhibit  steroidogenesis,  or  the  acute  withdrawal  of 
steroid agents such as megestrol. Among medications associated with 
hyperkalemia,  heparin  preparations  can  cause  selective  inhibition  of 
aldosterone  synthesis  by  zona  glomerulosa  cells,  leading  to  hyper-
reninemic hypoaldosteronism.

Hyporeninemic  hypoaldosteronism  is  a  very  common  predispos-
ing  factor  in  several  overlapping  subsets  of  hyperkalemic  patients: 
diabetics, the elderly, and patients with renal insufficiency. Classically, 
patients should have suppressed PRA and aldosterone; ~50% have an 
+,  a  posi-
associated  acidosis,  with  a  reduced  renal  excretion  of  NH4
tive urinary anion gap, and urine pH <5.5. Most patients are volume 
expanded,  with  secondary  increases  in  circulating  atrial  natriuretic 
peptide  (ANP)  that  inhibit  both  renal  renin  release  and  adrenal 
aldosterone release.

Renal Disease and Hyperkalemia  Chronic  kidney  disease  and 
end-stage  kidney  disease  are  very  common  causes  of  hyperkalemia, 
due  to  the  associated  deficit  or  absence  of  functioning  nephrons. 
Hyperkalemia is more common in oliguric acute kidney injury; distal 
tubular  flow  rate  and  Na+  delivery  are  less  limiting  factors  in  nono-
liguric  patients.  Hyperkalemia  out  of  proportion  to  GFR  can  also  be 
seen  in  the  context  of  tubulointerstitial  disease  that  affects  the  distal 
nephron, such as amyloidosis, sickle cell anemia, interstitial nephritis, 
and obstructive uropathy.

Hereditary  renal  causes  of  hyperkalemia  have  overlapping  clinical 
features  with  hypoaldosteronism,  hence  the  diagnostic  label  pseudo-
hypoaldosteronism (PHA). PHA type I (PHA-I) has both an autosomal 
recessive and an autosomal dominant form. The autosomal dominant 
form  is  due  to  loss-of-function  mutations  in  the  MLR;  the  recessive 
form  is  caused  by  various  combinations  of  mutations  in  the  three 
subunits of ENaC, resulting in impaired Na+ channel activity in prin-
cipal cells and other tissues. Patients with recessive PHA-I suffer from 
lifelong  salt  wasting,  hypotension,  and  hyperkalemia,  whereas  the 
phenotype  of  autosomal  dominant  PHA-I  due  to  MLR  dysfunction 
improves in adulthood. PHA type II (PHA-II; also known as hereditary 
hypertension with hyperkalemia) is in every respect the mirror image 
of GS caused by loss of function in NCC, the thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl– 
cotransporter  (see  above);  the  clinical  phenotype  includes  hyperten-
sion,  hyperkalemia,  hyperchloremic  metabolic  acidosis,  suppressed 
PRA  and  aldosterone,  hypercalciuria,  and  reduced  bone  density. 

PHA-II  thus  behaves  like  a  gain  of  function  in  NCC,  and  treatment 
with  thiazides  results  in  resolution  of  the  entire  clinical  phenotype. 
However,  the  NCC  gene  is  not  directly  involved  in  PHA-II,  which 
is  caused  by  mutations  in  the  WNK1  and  WNK4  serine-threonine 
kinases  or  the  upstream  Kelch-like  3  (KLHL3)  and  Cullin  3  (CUL3) 
proteins, two components of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that reg-
ulates these kinases; these proteins collectively regulate NCC activity, 
with PHA-II-associated activation of the transporter.
Medication-Associated Hyperkalemia  Most medications asso-
ciated with hyperkalemia cause inhibition of some component of the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin recep-
tor blockers, renin inhibitors, and MLRs are predictable and common 
causes of hyperkalemia, particularly when prescribed in combination. 
The  oral  contraceptive  agent  Yasmin-28  contains  the  progestin  dros-
pirenone,  which  inhibits  the  MLR  and  can  cause  hyperkalemia  in 
susceptible patients. Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, NSAIDs, and cycloox-
ygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors cause hyperkalemia by multiple mecha-
nisms, but share the ability to cause hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. 
Notably, most drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis 
also block the local adrenal response to hyperkalemia, thus attenuating 
the  direct  stimulation  of  aldosterone  release  by  increased  plasma  K+ 
concentration.

Inhibition of apical ENaC activity in the distal nephron by amiloride 
and  other  K+-sparing  diuretics  results  in  hyperkalemia,  often  with  a  
voltage-dependent  hyperchloremic  acidosis  and/or  hypovolemic 
hyponatremia.  Amiloride  is  structurally  similar  to  the  antibiotics  TMP 
and pentamidine, which also block ENaC; risk factors for TMP-associated 
hyperkalemia  include  the  administered  dose,  renal  insufficiency,  and 
hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. Indirect inhibition of ENaC at the 
plasma  membrane  is  also  a  cause  of  drug-associated  hyperkalemia; 
nafamostat,  a  protease  inhibitor  used  in  some  countries  for  anticoag-
ulation  and  for  the  management  of  pancreatitis,  inhibits  aldosterone- 
induced renal proteases that activate ENaC by proteolytic cleavage.
Clinical  Features  Hyperkalemia  is  a  medical  emergency  due  to 
its  effects  on  the  heart.  Cardiac  arrhythmias  associated  with  hyper-
kalemia  include  sinus  bradycardia,  sinus  arrest,  slow  idioventric-
ular  rhythms,  ventricular  tachycardia,  ventricular  fibrillation,  and 
asystole.  Mild  increases  in  extracellular  K+  affect  the  repolarization 
phase  of  the  cardiac  action  potential,  resulting  in  changes  in  T-wave 
morphology;  further  increase  in  plasma  K+  concentration  depresses 
intracardiac conduction, with progressive prolongation of the PR and 
QRS intervals. Severe hyperkalemia results in loss of the P wave and a 
progressive widening of the QRS complex; development of a sine-wave 
sinoventricular rhythm suggests impending ventricular fibrillation or 
asystole. Hyperkalemia can also cause a type I Brugada pattern in the 
electrocardiogram  (ECG),  with  a  pseudo–right  bundle  branch  block 
and  persistent  coved  ST-segment  elevation  in  at  least  two  precordial 
leads. This hyperkalemic Brugada’s sign occurs in critically ill patients 
with  severe  hyperkalemia  and  can  be  differentiated  from  genetic  
Brugada’s syndrome by an absence of P waves, marked QRS widening, 
and  an  abnormal  QRS  axis.  Classically,  the  ECG  manifestations  in 
hyperkalemia  progress  from  tall  peaked  T  waves  (5.5–6.5  mM),  to  a 
loss  of  P  waves  (6.5–7.5  mM),  to  a  widened  QRS  complex  (7.0–8.0 
mM), and, ultimately, a to a sine wave pattern (>8.0 mM). However, 
these changes are notoriously insensitive, particularly in patients with 
chronic kidney disease or ESRD.

Hyperkalemia  from  a  variety  of  causes  can  also  present  with 
ascending  paralysis,  denoted  secondary  hyperkalemic  paralysis  to  dif-
ferentiate  it  from  familial  hyperkalemic  periodic  paralysis  (HYPP). 
The presentation may include diaphragmatic paralysis and respiratory 
failure. Patients with familial HYPP develop myopathic weakness dur-
ing  hyperkalemia  induced  by  increased  K+  intake  or  rest  after  heavy 
exercise. Depolarization of skeletal muscle by hyperkalemia unmasks 
an  inactivation  defect  in  skeletal  Na+  channel;  autosomal  dominant 
mutations in the SCN4A gene encoding this channel are the predom-
inant cause.

Within the kidney, hyperkalemia has negative effects on the ability 
to excrete an acid load, such that hyperkalemia per se can contribute to

354 metabolic acidosis. This defect appears to be due in part to competition 
between K+ and NH4
+ for reabsorption by the TALH and subsequent 
countercurrent  multiplication,  ultimately  reducing  the  medullary 
gradient for NH3/NH4 excretion by the distal nephron. Regardless of 
the underlying mechanism, restoration of normokalemia can, in many 
instances, correct hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis.

Diagnostic  Approach  The  first  priority  in  the  management  of 
hyperkalemia is to assess the need for emergency treatment, followed 
by a comprehensive workup to determine the cause (Fig. 53-8). His-
tory and physical examination should focus on medications, diet and 
dietary supplements, risk factors for kidney failure, reduction in urine 
output,  blood  pressure,  and  volume  status.  Initial  laboratory  tests 
should  include  electrolytes,  BUN,  creatinine,  serum  osmolality,  Mg2+ 
and Ca2+, a complete blood count, and urinary pH, osmolality, creatin-
ine, and electrolytes. A urine Na+ concentration of <20 mM indicates 

that  distal  Na+  delivery  is  a  limiting  factor  in  K+  excretion;  volume 
repletion with 0.9% saline or treatment with furosemide may be effec-
tive in reducing plasma K+ concentration. Serum and urine osmolality 
are  required  for  calculation  of  the  transtubular  K+  gradient  (TTKG) 
(Fig. 53-8). The expected values of the TTKG are largely based on his-
torical data, and are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the 
presence of hyperkalemia. Notably, some authors have opined that the 
TTKG does not consider the effects of distal tubular urea reabsorption 
on potassium excretion, concluding that the TTKG is, thus, an unreli-
able test in the assessment of hyperkalemia. These criticisms are theo-
retical and not supported by animal experiments; the TTKG remains 
a helpful bedside test of urinary potassium excretion in hyperkalemia.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesTREATMENT
Hyperkalemia

ECG manifestations of hyperkalemia should be considered a med-
ical  emergency  and  treated  urgently.  However,  patients  with  sig-
nificant hyperkalemia (plasma K+ concentration ≥6.5 mM) in the 
absence of ECG changes should also be aggressively managed, given 
the  limitations  of  ECG  changes  as  a  predictor  of  cardiac  toxicity. 
Urgent  management  of  hyperkalemia  includes  admission  to  the 
hospital, continuous cardiac monitoring, and immediate treatment. 
The treatment of hyperkalemia is divided into three stages:

1.  Immediate  antagonism  of  the  cardiac  effects  of  hyperkalemia. 
Intravenous  calcium  serves  to  protect  the  heart,  whereas  other 
measures  are  taken  to  correct  hyperkalemia.  Calcium  raises 
the  action  potential  threshold  and  reduces  excitability,  without 
changing  the  resting  membrane  potential.  By  restoring  the 
difference  between  resting  and  threshold  potentials,  calcium 
reverses the  depolarization  blockade due to  hyperkalemia. The 
recommended dose is 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate (3–4 mL 
of  calcium  chloride),  infused  intravenously  over  2–3  min  with 
cardiac monitoring. The effect of the infusion starts in 1–3 min 
and lasts 30–60 min; the dose should be repeated if there is no 
change  in  ECG  findings  or  if  they  recur  after  initial  improve-
ment. Hypercalcemia potentiates the cardiac toxicity of digoxin; 
hence, intravenous calcium should be used with extreme caution 
in patients taking this medication; if judged necessary, 10 mL of 
10% calcium gluconate can be added to 100 mL of 5% dextrose in 
water and infused over 20–30 min to avoid acute hypercalcemia.
2.  Rapid reduction in plasma K+ concentration by redistribution into 
cells. Insulin lowers plasma K+ concentration by shifting K+ into 
cells. The recommended dose is 10 units of intravenous regular 
insulin followed immediately by 50 mL of 50% dextrose (D50W, 
25 g of glucose total); the effect begins in 10–20 min, peaks at 
30–60 min, and lasts for 4–6 h. Bolus D50W without insulin is never 
appropriate, given the risk of acutely worsening hyperkalemia due 
to  the  osmotic  effect  of  hypertonic  glucose.  Hypoglycemia  is 
common  with  insulin  plus  glucose;  hence,  this  should  be  fol-
lowed by an infusion of 10% dextrose at 50–75 mL/h, with close 
monitoring  of  plasma  glucose  concentration.  In  hyperkalemic 
patients with glucose concentrations of ≥200–250 mg/dL, insulin 
should be administered without glucose, again with close moni-
toring of glucose concentrations.
  β2-Agonists,  most  commonly  albuterol,  are  effective  but 
underused  agents  for  the  acute  management  of  hyperkalemia. 
Albuterol  and  insulin  with  glucose  have  an  additive  effect  on 
plasma K+ concentration; however, ~20% of patients with ESRD 
are  resistant  to  the  effect  of  β2-agonists;  hence,  these  drugs 
should  not  be  used  without  insulin.  The  recommended  dose 
for  inhaled  albuterol  is  10–20  mg  of  nebulized  albuterol  in  4 
mL  of  normal  saline,  inhaled  over  10  min;  the  effect  starts  at 
about  30  min,  reaches  its  peak  at  about  90  min,  and  lasts  for 
2–6 h. Hyperglycemia is a side effect, along with tachycardia. β2- 
Agonists should be used with caution in hyperkalemic patients 
with known cardiac disease.

Intravenous  bicarbonate  has  no  role  in  the  acute  treatment 
of  hyperkalemia,  but  may  slowly  attenuate  hyperkalemia  with 
sustained  administration  over  several  hours.  It  should  not  be 
given repeatedly as a hypertonic intravenous bolus of undiluted 
ampules, given the risk of associated hypernatremia and hyper-
tonicity,  but  should  instead  be  infused  in  an  isotonic  or  hypo-
tonic  fluid  (e.g.,  150  milliequivalents  of  sodium  bicarbonate  in 
1 L of D5W). In patients with metabolic acidosis, a delayed drop 
in plasma K+ concentration can be seen after 4–6 h of isotonic 
bicarbonate infusion.

3.  Removal of potassium. This is typically accomplished using cation 
exchange resins, diuretics, and/or dialysis. The cation exchange 
resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) exchanges Na+ for K+ 
in the gastrointestinal tract and increases the fecal excretion of

K+. The recommended dose of SPS is 15–30 g of powder, almost 
always  given  in  a  premade  suspension  with  33%  sorbitol.  The 
effect of SPS on plasma K+ concentration is slow; the full effect 
may take up to 24 h and usually requires repeated doses every 
4–6  h.  Intestinal  necrosis,  typically  of  the  colon  or  ileum,  is  a 
rare but usually fatal complication of SPS. Intestinal necrosis is 
more common in patients with reduced intestinal motility (e.g., 
in the postoperative state or after treatment with opioids). The 
coadministration of SPS with sorbitol appears to increase the risk 
of intestinal necrosis; however, this complication can also occur 
with SPS alone, and in animal models, SPS is the causative agent. 
The low but real risk of intestinal necrosis with SPS, which can 
sometimes  be  the  only  available  or  appropriate  therapy  for  the 
removal of potassium, must be weighed against the delayed onset 
of efficacy. Whenever possible, alternative therapies for the acute 
management of hyperkalemia (i.e., alternative potassium binders, 
aggressive  redistributive  therapy,  isotonic  bicarbonate  infusion, 
diuretics, and/or hemodialysis) should be used instead of SPS.
  Novel  intestinal  potassium  binders  have  recently  become 
available  for  the  management  of  hyperkalemia.  These  agents 
lack the intestinal toxicity of SPS and are preferred over SPS for 
the  management  of  hyperkalemia.  Patiromer  is  a  nonabsorbed 
polymer  provided  as  a  powder  for  suspension,  which  binds 
K+  in  exchange  for  Ca2+.  In  healthy  adults,  patiromer  causes  a 
decrease in urinary potassium, magnesium, and sodium excre-
tion, suggesting the binding of the polymer to these cations in 
the  intestine;  notably,  a  major  side  effect  of  the  medication  is 
hypomagnesemia.  ZS-9  (sodium  zirconium  cyclosilicate)  is  an 
inorganic, nonabsorbable crystalline compound that exchanges 
both Na+ and H+ ions in exchange for K+ and NH4
+ in the intes-
tine. These agents have revolutionized the management of both 
chronic and acute hyperkalemia. In particular, the availability of 
safe, well-tolerated potassium binders allows for greater intensity 
of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition in both renal 
and cardiac disease.
  Therapy  with  intravenous  saline  may  be  beneficial  in 
hypovolemic patients with oliguria and decreased distal delivery 
of  Na+,  with  the  associated  reductions  in  renal  K+  excretion. 
Loop  and  thiazide  diuretics  can  be  used  to  reduce  plasma  K+ 
concentration  in  volume-replete  or  hypervolemic patients with 
sufficient renal function for a diuretic response; this may need to 
be combined with intravenous saline or isotonic bicarbonate to 
achieve or maintain euvolemia.
  Hemodialysis  is  the  most  effective  and  reliable  method  to 
reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is consider-
ably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require tem-
porary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant 
risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kid-
ney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount 
of  K+  removed  during  hemodialysis  depends  on  the  relative 
distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by 
prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the 
dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, 
dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

Hypocalcemia
Sundeep Khosla

The  calcium  ion  plays  a  critical  role  in  normal  cellular  function  and 
signaling, regulating diverse physiologic processes such as neuromus-
cular  signaling,  cardiac  contractility,  hormone  secretion,  and  blood 
coagulation. Thus, extracellular calcium concentrations are maintained 
within an exquisitely narrow range through a series of feedback mecha-
nisms that involve parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the active vitamin 
D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]. These feedback 
mechanisms are orchestrated by integrating signals between the para-
thyroid  glands,  kidney,  intestine,  and  bone  (Fig.  54-1;  Chap.  409).

HYPERCALCEMIA
 ■ ETIOLOGY
The  causes  of  hypercalcemia  can  be  understood  and  classified  based 
on  derangements  in  the  normal  feedback  mechanisms  that  regulate 
serum  calcium  (Table  54-1).  Excess  PTH  production,  which  is  not 
appropriately suppressed by increased serum calcium concentrations, 
occurs  in  primary  neoplastic  disorders  of  the  parathyroid  glands 
(parathyroid  adenomas;  hyperplasia;  or,  rarely,  carcinoma)  that  are 
associated with increased parathyroid cell mass and impaired feedback 
inhibition  by  calcium.  Inappropriate  PTH  secretion  for  the  ambient 
level  of  serum  calcium  also  occurs  in  familial  hypocalciuric  hyper-
calcemia  (FHH),  which  is  an  autosomal  dominant  syndrome  most 
commonly  involving  inactivating  mutations  in  the  calcium  sensor 
receptor (CaSR; FHH type 1), with rare families having mutations in 
the Gα11 protein (GNA11; FHH type 2) or the adaptor-related protein 
complex  2,  σ-2  subunit  (AP2S1;  FHH  type  3);  all  of  these  mutations 
impair extracellular calcium sensing by the parathyroid glands and the 
kidneys,  leading  to  inappropriate  PTH  secretion  and  increased  renal 
tubular  calcium  reabsorption.  Although  PTH  secretion  by  tumors 
is  extremely  rare,  many  solid  tumors  produce  PTH-related  peptide 
(PTHrP), which shares homology with PTH in the first 13 amino acids 
and binds the PTH receptor, thus mimicking effects of PTH on bone 
and  the  kidney.  In  PTHrP-mediated  hypercalcemia  of  malignancy, 
PTH  levels  are  suppressed  by  the  high  serum  calcium  levels.  Hyper-
calcemia  associated  with  granulomatous  disease  (e.g.,  sarcoidosis) 
or lymphomas is caused by enhanced conversion of 25(OH)D to the 
potent 1,25(OH)2D. In these disorders, 1,25(OH)2D enhances intestinal 
calcium absorption, resulting in hypercalcemia and suppressed PTH. 
Disorders that directly increase calcium mobilization from bone, such 
as hyperthyroidism or osteolytic metastases, also lead to hypercalcemia

FIGURE 54-1  Feedback mechanisms maintaining extracellular calcium concentrations 
within a narrow, physiologic range (8.9–10.1 mg/dL [2.2–2.5 mM]). A decrease in 
extracellular (ECF) calcium (Ca2+) triggers an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
secretion  (1)  via  the  calcium  sensor  receptor  on  parathyroid  cells.  PTH,  in  turn, 
results in increased tubular reabsorption of calcium by the kidney (2) and resorption 
of  calcium  from  bone  (2)  and  also  stimulates  renal  1,25(OH)2D  production  (3). 
1,25(OH)2D, in turn, acts principally on the intestine to increase calcium absorption 
(4).  Collectively,  these  homeostatic  mechanisms  serve  to  restore  serum  calcium 
levels to normal.

with suppressed PTH secretion as does exogenous calcium overload,

TREATMENT
Hypercalcemia

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Mild  hypercalcemia  (up  to  11–11.5  mg/dL)  is  usually  asymptomatic 
and recognized only on routine calcium measurements. Some patients 
may  complain  of  vague  neuropsychiatric  symptoms,  including  trouble 
concentrating,  personality  changes,  or  depression.  Other  presenting 
symptoms may include peptic ulcer disease or nephrolithiasis, and frac-
ture risk may be increased. More severe hypercalcemia (>12–13 mg/dL),  
particularly  if  it  develops  acutely,  may  result  in  lethargy,  stupor, 
or  coma,  as  well  as  gastrointestinal  symptoms  (nausea,  anorexia, 
constipation,  or  pancreatitis).  Hypercalcemia  decreases  renal  con-
centrating ability, which may cause polyuria and polydipsia. With long- 
standing  hyperparathyroidism,  patients  may  present  with  bone  pain 
or pathologic fractures. Finally, hypercalcemia can result in significant 
electrocardiographic  changes,  including  bradycardia,  atrioventricular 
(AV) block, and short QT interval; changes in serum calcium can be 
monitored by following the QT interval.

 ■ DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH
The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of hyper- or hypocalcemia 
is  to  ensure  that  the  alteration  in  serum  calcium  levels  is  not  due  to 
abnormal  albumin  concentrations.  About  50%  of  total  calcium  is 
ionized, and the rest is bound principally to albumin. Although direct 
measurements  of  ionized  calcium  are  possible,  they  are  easily  influ-
enced  by  collection  methods  and  other  artifacts;  thus,  it  is  generally 
preferable to measure total calcium and albumin to “correct” the serum 
calcium. When serum albumin concentrations are reduced, a corrected 
calcium concentration is calculated by adding 0.2 mM (0.8 mg/dL) to 
the total calcium level for every decrement in serum albumin of 1.0 g/
dL below the reference value of 4.1 g/dL for albumin, and, conversely, 
for elevations in serum albumin.

A detailed history may provide important clues regarding the etiol-
ogy of the hypercalcemia (Table 54-1). Chronic hypercalcemia is most 
commonly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism, as opposed to the 
second most common etiology of hypercalcemia, an underlying malig-
nancy. The history should include medication use, previous neck sur-
gery, and systemic symptoms suggestive of sarcoidosis or lymphoma.

Once true hypercalcemia is established, the second most important 
laboratory test in the diagnostic evaluation is a PTH level using a two-
site assay for the intact hormone. Increases in PTH are often accom-
panied  by  hypophosphatemia.  In  addition,  serum  creatinine  should 
be measured to assess renal function; hypercalcemia may impair renal 
function, and renal clearance of PTH may be altered depending on the 
fragments detected by the assay. If the PTH level is increased (or “inap-
propriately normal”) in the setting of elevated calcium and low phos-
phorus, the diagnosis is almost always primary hyperparathyroidism. 
Because individuals with FHH may also present with mildly elevated 
PTH levels and hypercalcemia, this diagnosis should be considered and 
excluded because parathyroid surgery is ineffective in this condition. A 
calcium/creatinine clearance ratio (calculated as urine calcium/serum 
calcium  divided  by  urine  creatinine/serum  creatinine)  of  <0.01  is 
suggestive of FHH, particularly when there is a family history of mild, 
asymptomatic  hypercalcemia.  In  addition,  sequence  analysis  of  the 
CASR gene is now commonly performed for the definitive diagnosis of 
FHH, although as noted above, in rare families, FHH may be caused 
by mutations in the GNA11 or AP2S1 genes, and patients may have to 
pay  out-of-pocket  for  the  genetic  analysis.  Ectopic  PTH  secretion  is 
extremely rare.

A suppressed PTH level in the face of hypercalcemia is consistent 
with  non-parathyroid-mediated  hypercalcemia,  most  often  due  to 
underlying  malignancy.  Although  a  tumor  that  causes  hypercalce-
mia is generally overt, a PTHrP level may be needed to establish the 
diagnosis  of  hypercalcemia  of  malignancy.  Serum  1,25(OH)2D  levels 
are  increased  in  granulomatous  disorders,  and  clinical  evaluation  in 
combination with laboratory testing will generally provide a diagnosis 
for the various disorders listed in Table 54-1.

Mild,  asymptomatic  hypercalcemia  does  not  require  immediate 
therapy,  and  management  should  be  dictated  by  the  underlying 
diagnosis. By contrast, significant, symptomatic hypercalcemia usu-
ally requires therapeutic intervention independent of the etiology of 
hypercalcemia.  Initial  therapy  of  significant  hypercalcemia  begins 
with  volume  expansion  because  hypercalcemia  invariably  leads 
to dehydration; 4–6 L of intravenous saline may be required over 
the first 24 h, keeping in mind that underlying comorbidities (e.g., 
congestive  heart  failure)  may  require  the  use  of  loop  diuretics  to 
enhance  sodium  and  calcium  excretion.  However,  loop  diuretics 
should not be initiated until the volume status has been restored to 
normal. If there is increased calcium mobilization from bone (as in 
malignancy or severe hyperparathyroidism), drugs that inhibit bone 
resorption should be considered. Although salmon calcitonin (4–8 
IU/kg  intramuscularly  or  subcutaneously  every  6–12  h)  is  some-
times  used,  the  mainstays  of  therapy  are  bisphosphonates,  which 
are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. Zoledronic acid (e.g., 4 mg 
intravenously over ~30 min) and pamidronate (e.g., 60–90 mg intra-
venously over 2–4 h) are bisphosphonates that are commonly used 
for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults. Onset 
of action is within 1–3 days, with normalization of serum calcium 
levels  occurring  in  60–90%  of  patients.  Bisphosphonate  infusions 
may need to be repeated if hypercalcemia relapses. Denosumab (120 
mg subcutaneously on days 1, 8, 15, and 29, and then every 4 weeks), 
an antibody to RANKL, is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption and 
has been shown to be effective in treating hypercalcemia refractory 
to bisphosphonates. An alternative to the bisphosphonates or deno-
sumab is gallium nitrate (200 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days), 
which  is  also  effective,  but  has  potential  nephrotoxicity.  In  rare 
instances, dialysis may be necessary. Finally, although intravenous 
phosphate chelates calcium and decreases serum calcium levels, this 
therapy  can  be  toxic  because  calcium-phosphate  complexes  may 
deposit in tissues and cause extensive organ damage.

In  patients  with  1,25(OH)2D-mediated  hypercalcemia,  gluco-
corticoids are the preferred therapy, as they decrease 1,25(OH)2D 
production.  Intravenous  hydrocortisone  (100–300  mg  daily)  or 
oral prednisone (40–60 mg daily) for 3–7 days is used most often. 
Other  drugs,  such  as  ketoconazole,  chloroquine,  and  hydroxy-
chloroquine,  may  also  decrease  1,25(OH)2D  production  and  are 
used occasionally.

HYPOCALCEMIA
 ■ ETIOLOGY
The causes of hypocalcemia can be differentiated according to whether 
serum  PTH  levels  are  low  (hypoparathyroidism)  or  high  (secondary 
hyperparathyroidism).  Although  there  are  many  potential  causes  of 
hypocalcemia,  impaired  PTH  production  and  impaired  vitamin  D 
production are the most common etiologies (Table 54-2) (Chap. 410). 
Because PTH is the main defense against hypocalcemia, disorders asso-
ciated with deficient PTH production or secretion may be associated 
with profound, life-threatening hypocalcemia. In adults, hypoparathy-
roidism  most  commonly  results  from  inadvertent  damage  to  all  four 
glands during thyroid or parathyroid gland surgery. Hypoparathyroid-
ism is a cardinal feature of autoimmune endocrinopathies (Chap. 388); 
rarely, it may be associated with infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis. 
Impaired PTH secretion may be secondary to magnesium deficiency or 
to activating mutations in the CaSR or in the G proteins that mediate 
CaSR signaling (autosomal dominant hypocalcemia), which suppress 
PTH, leading to effects that are opposite to those that occur in FHH.

Vitamin D deficiency, impaired 1,25(OH)2D production (primarily 
secondary  to  renal  insufficiency),  or  vitamin  D  resistance  also  cause 
hypocalcemia. However, the degree of hypocalcemia in these disorders 
is generally not as severe as that seen with hypoparathyroidism because 
the parathyroids are capable of mounting a compensatory increase in

PTH secretion. Hypocalcemia may also occur in conditions associated 
with severe tissue injury such as burns, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis, or 
pancreatitis. The cause of hypocalcemia in these settings may include a 
combination of low albumin, hyperphosphatemia, tissue deposition of 
calcium, and impaired PTH secretion.

hypercalcemia, determining the PTH level is central to the evaluation 
of  hypocalcemia.  A  suppressed  (or  “inappropriately  low”)  PTH  level 
in  the  setting  of  hypocalcemia  establishes  absent  or  reduced  PTH 
secretion  (hypoparathyroidism)  as  the  cause  of  the  hypocalcemia. 
Further history will often elicit the underlying cause (i.e., parathyroid 
agenesis vs destruction). By contrast, an elevated PTH level (secondary 
hyperparathyroidism) should direct attention to the vitamin D axis as 
the cause of the hypocalcemia. Nutritional vitamin D deficiency is best 
assessed by obtaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, which reflect 
vitamin D stores. In the setting of renal insufficiency or suspected vita-
min D resistance, serum 1,25(OH)2D levels are informative.

TREATMENT
Hypocalcemia

The approach to treatment depends on the severity of the hypocal-
cemia, the rapidity with which it develops, and the accompanying 
complications  (e.g.,  seizures,  laryngospasm).  Acute,  symptomatic 
hypocalcemia is initially managed with calcium gluconate, 10 mL 
10% wt/vol (90 mg or 2.2 mmol) intravenously, diluted in 50 mL 
of 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride, given intravenously over 
5 min. Continuing hypocalcemia often requires a constant intrave-
nous infusion (typically 10 ampules of calcium gluconate or 900 mg 
of calcium in 1 L of 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride admin-
istered  over  24  h).  Accompanying  hypomagnesemia,  if  present, 
should be treated with appropriate magnesium supplementation.

Chronic  hypocalcemia  due  to  hypoparathyroidism  is  treated 
with calcium supplements (1000–1500 mg/d elemental calcium in 
divided doses) and either vitamin D2 or D3 (25,000–100,000 U daily) 
or calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D, 0.25–2 μg/d]. Other vitamin D metabo-
lites (dihydrotachysterol, alfacalcidiol) are now used less frequently. 
Importantly,  PTH  (1-84)  (Natpara)  is  now  approved  by  the  Food 
and  Drug  Administration  for  the  treatment  of  refractory  hypo-
parathyroidism, representing an important advance in treatment of 
these patients. Vitamin D deficiency is best treated using vitamin 
D  supplementation,  with  the  dose  depending  on  the  severity  of 
the  deficit  and  the  underlying  cause.  Thus,  nutritional  vitamin  D 
deficiency generally responds to relatively low doses of vitamin D 
(50,000 IU, 2–3 times per week for several months), whereas vita-
min D deficiency due to malabsorption may require much higher 
doses (100,000 IU/d or more). The treatment goal is to bring serum 
calcium  into  the  low  normal  range  and  to  avoid  hypercalciuria, 
which may lead to nephrolithiasis.

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Patients with hypocalcemia may be asymptomatic if the decreases in 
serum  calcium  are  relatively  mild  and  chronic,  or  they  may  present 
with life-threatening complications. Moderate to severe hypocalcemia 
is associated with paresthesias, usually of the fingers, toes, and circu-
moral  regions,  and  is  caused  by  increased  neuromuscular  irritability. 
On  physical  examination,  a  Chvostek’s  sign  (twitching  of  the  circu-
moral  muscles  in  response  to  gentle  tapping  of  the  facial  nerve  just 
anterior to the ear) may be elicited, although it is also present in ~10% 
of  normal  individuals.  Carpal  spasm  may  be  induced  by  inflation  of 
a  blood  pressure  cuff  to  20  mmHg  above  the  patient’s  systolic  blood 
pressure for 3 min (Trousseau’s sign). Severe hypocalcemia can induce 
seizures, carpopedal spasm, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and prolon-
gation of the QT interval.

 ■ DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH
In  addition  to  measuring  serum  calcium,  it  is  useful  to  determine 
albumin, phosphorus, and magnesium levels. As for the evaluation of 

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
In countries with more limited access to health care or screening lab-
oratory testing of serum calcium levels, primary hyperparathyroidism 
often  presents  in  its  severe  form  with  skeletal  complications  (osteitis 
fibrosa cystica) in contrast to the asymptomatic form that is common 
in developed countries. In addition, vitamin D deficiency is paradoxi-
cally common in some countries despite extensive sunlight (e.g., India) 
due to avoidance of sun exposure and poor dietary vitamin D intake.

NORMAL ACID-BASE HOMEOSTASIS
Systemic  arterial  pH  is  maintained  between  7.35  and  7.45  by  extra-
cellular and intracellular chemical buffering together with respiratory 
and renal regulatory mechanisms. The control of arterial CO2 tension 
(Paco2) by the central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory system 
and the control of plasma bicarbonate by the kidneys stabilize the arte-
rial pH by excretion or retention of acid or alkali. The metabolic and 
respiratory components that regulate systemic pH are described by the 
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and solved for pH when the solubil-
ity of CO2 is considered (dissolved CO2 in mmol/L = 0.03 × Paco2 in 
mmHg), at a pK′ of 6.1:

Under  most  circumstances,  CO2  production  and  excretion  are 
matched, and the usual steady-state Paco2 is maintained at ~40 mmHg. 
Underexcretion  of  CO2  produces  hypercapnia,  and  overexcretion 
causes  hypocapnia.  Nevertheless,  production  and  excretion  are  again 
matched at a new steady-state Paco2. Therefore, the Paco2 is regulated 
primarily by neural respiratory factors and is not subject to regulation 
by  the  rate  of  CO2  production.  Hypercapnia  is  usually  the  result  of 
hypoventilation  rather  than  of  increased  CO2  production.  Increases 
or  decreases  in  Paco2  represent  derangements  of  neural  respiratory 
control or are due to compensatory changes in response to a primary 
alteration in the plasma [HCO3

−].

DIAGNOSIS OF GENERAL TYPES OF 
DISTURBANCES
The  most  common  clinical  disturbances  are  simple  acid-base  disor-
ders; i.e., metabolic acidosis or alkalosis or respiratory acidosis or alka-
losis occurring individually. Recognition of simple acid-base disorders 
requires  appreciation  of  the  limits  of  physiologic  compensation  for  a 
primary disturbance.

 ■ SIMPLE ACID-BASE DISORDERS
Primary  respiratory  disturbances  (primary  changes  in  Paco2)  
invoke  compensatory  metabolic  responses  (secondary  changes  in 
−]), and primary metabolic disturbances elicit predictable com-
[HCO3
pensatory respiratory responses (secondary changes in Paco2). Physio-
logic compensation can be predicted from the relationships displayed in  
Table  55-1.  In  general,  with  one  exception,  compensatory  responses 
return the pH toward, but not to, the normal value. Chronic respiratory 
alkalosis when prolonged is an exception to this rule and may return 
the  pH  to  a  normal  value.  Metabolic  acidosis  due  to  an  increase  in 
endogenous acid production (e.g., ketoacidosis or lactic acid acidosis) 
−] and decreases extracellular pH. This 
lowers extracellular fluid [HCO3
stimulates  the  medullary  chemoreceptors  to  increase  ventilation  and 
−] to Paco2, and thus pH, toward, but not 
to return the ratio of [HCO3
typically to, the normal value. The degree of respiratory compensation 
expected  in  a  metabolic  acidosis  can  be  predicted  from  the  relation-
−])  +  8  ±  2  (Winter’s  equation).  Thus, 
ship:  Paco2  =  (1.5  ×  [HCO3
−] 
applying this equation, a patient with metabolic acidosis and [HCO3
of  12  mmol/L  would  be  expected  to  have  a  Paco2  of  approximately  
26 mmHg. In this example, if values for Paco2 were <24 or >28 mmHg, 
values that exceed the boundaries for compensation for a simple dis-
order,  a  mixed  disturbance  should  be  recognized  (metabolic  acidosis 
plus  respiratory  alkalosis  or  metabolic  acidosis  plus  respiratory  aci-
dosis,  respectively).  Compensatory  responses  for  primary  metabolic 
disorders  move  the  Paco2  in  the  same  direction  as  the  change  in 
−], while compensation for primary respiratory disorders moves 
[HCO3
−]  in  the  same  direction  as  the  primary  change  in  Paco2

compensation in simple disturbances, finding acid-base values within 
the  shaded  area  does  not  necessarily  rule  out  a  mixed  disturbance. 
Imposition  of  one  disorder  over  another  may  result  in  values  lying 
within the area of a third. Thus, the nomogram, while convenient, is 
not a substitute for the equations in Table 55-1.
 ■ MIXED ACID-BASE DISORDERS
Mixed  acid-base  disorders—defined  as  independently  coexisting  dis-
orders, not merely compensatory responses—are often seen in patients 
in  critical  care  units  and  can  lead  to  dangerous  extremes  of  pH  
(Table 55-2). The diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders requires con-
sideration of the anion gap (AG). To be accurate, the AG requires the 
presence of, or correction to, a normal serum albumin of 4.5 g/dL (see 
below,  “Evaluate  the  Anion  Gap”).  If  a  patient  with  diabetic  ketoaci-
dosis  (metabolic  acidosis)  and  a  high  AG  has  an  independent  and 
concomitant respiratory disorder (e.g., pneumonia), the latter may lead 
to a superimposed respiratory acidosis or alkalosis and the Paco2 will 
deviate from the predicted value for the response to a pure high-AG 
metabolic  acidosis  (Table  55-2).  Patients  with  underlying  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease may not respond to metabolic acidosis 
with an appropriate ventilatory response because of insufficient respi-
ratory reserve (Table 55-2). Such imposition of respiratory acidosis on 
metabolic acidosis can lead to severe acidemia. When metabolic acido-
sis and metabolic alkalosis coexist in the same patient, the pH may be 
in the normal range. In this circumstance, it is the presence of an ele-
vated AG (see below) that denotes the presence of a metabolic acidosis. 
Assuming a normal value for the AG of 10 mmol/L, incongruity in the 
− (normal value of  
ΔAG (existing minus normal AG) and the ΔHCO3
− in the patient) indicates the pres-
25 mmol/L minus abnormal HCO3
ence of a mixed high-gap acidosis—metabolic alkalosis (see example 
below). A diabetic patient with ketoacidosis may have acute or chronic 
kidney failure resulting in a combination of metabolic acidoses from

accumulation of both ketoacids and uremic acids. Patients who have 
ingested  an  overdose  of  drug  combinations  such  as  sedatives  and 
salicylates  may  have  mixed  disturbances  as  a  result  of  the  acid-base 
response to the individual drugs (metabolic acidosis mixed with respi-
ratory acidosis or respiratory alkalosis, respectively). Triple acid-base 
disturbances are more complex. For example, patients with metabolic 
acidosis due to alcoholic ketoacidosis may develop metabolic alkalosis 
due  to  vomiting  and  superimposed  respiratory  alkalosis  due  to  the 
hyperventilation of hepatic dysfunction or alcohol withdrawal.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Acid-Base Disorders

The  diagnosis  of  acid-base  disorders  follows  a  stepwise  approach 
(Table 55-3). Blood for electrolytes and arterial blood gases should 
−] 
be drawn simultaneously, prior to therapy. An increase in [HCO3
occurs with either metabolic alkalosis or respiratory acidosis. Con-
−] occurs with either metabolic acidosis 
versely, a decrease in [HCO3
or respiratory alkalosis. In the determination of arterial blood gases 
by  the  clinical  laboratory,  both  pH  and  Paco2  are  measured,  and 
−]  is  calculated  from  the  Henderson-Hasselbalch  equa-
the  [HCO3
tion. This calculated value should be compared with the measured 
−] (or total CO2) on the electrolyte panel. These two values 
[HCO3
should agree within 2 mmol/L. If they do not, the values may not 
have been drawn simultaneously, or a laboratory error may be pres-
ent. After verifying the blood acid-base values, the precise acid-base 
disorder can then be classified. 
EVALUATE THE ANION GAP
Evaluations  of  acid-base  disorders  should  involve  acknowledge-
ment of the AG. The AG is calculated, either by the clinical labo-
ratory or the clinician, as follows: AG = Na+ – (Cl− + HCO3
−). The 
value for plasma [K+] is typically omitted from the calculation of the 
AG in the United States. The “normal” value for the AG reported by 
clinical laboratories has declined with improved methodology for 
measuring plasma electrolytes and ranges from 6−12 mmol/L, with 
an  average  of  approximately  10  mmol/L.  The  unmeasured  anions 
normally present in plasma include anionic proteins (e.g., albumin), 
phosphate, sulfate, and organic anions. When acid anions, such as 
acetoacetate and lactate, accumulate in extracellular fluid, the AG 
increases,  causing  a  high-AG  acidosis.  An  increase  in  the  AG  is 
most often due to an increase in unmeasured anions but, less com-
monly, may be due to a decrease in unmeasured cations (calcium, 
magnesium, potassium). In addition, the AG may increase with an 
increase in anionic albumin (e.g., severe dehydration). A decrease 
in  the  AG  can  be  due  to  (1)  an  increase  in  unmeasured  cations; 
(2) the addition to the blood of abnormal cations, such as lithium 
(lithium  intoxication)  or  cationic  immunoglobulins  (plasma  cell 
dyscrasias); (3) a reduction in the plasma anion albumin concen-
tration  (nephrotic  syndrome,  liver  disease,  or  malabsorption);  or 
(4) hyperviscosity and severe hyperlipidemia, which can lead to an 
underestimation  of  sodium  and  chloride  concentrations.  Because 
the normal AG of 10 mmol/L assumes that the serum albumin is 
normal, if hypoalbuminemia is present, the value for the AG must

be corrected. For example, for each g/dL of serum albumin below 
the  normal  value  (4.5  g/dL),  2.5  mmol/L  should  be  added  to  the 
reported (uncorrected) AG. Thus, in a patient with a serum albu-
min of 2.5 g/dL (2 g/dL below the normal value) and an uncorrected 
AG of 15, the corrected AG is calculated by adding 5 mmol/L (2.5 × 
2 = 5; 5 + 15 = corrected AG of 20 mmol/L). Clinical laboratories do 
not correct the AG for coexisting hypoalbuminemia and typically 
report the uncorrected value, requiring the attention of the clinician 
to the prevailing serum albumin concentration. The clinical disor-
ders that may cause a high-AG acidosis are displayed in Table 55-3.
A  high  AG  is  usually  due  to  accumulation  of  non–chloride- 
containing acids that contain inorganic (phosphate, sulfate), organic 
(ketoacids,  lactate,  uremic  organic  anions),  exogenous  (salicylate 
or  ingested  toxins  with  organic  acid  production),  or  unidentified

Similarly, normal values for [HCO3

the  absence  of  an  acid-base  disturbance.  For  instance,  an  alcoholic 
who has been vomiting may develop a metabolic alkalosis with a pH

of  7.55,  Paco2  of  47  mmHg,  [HCO3

a  superimposed  alcoholic  ketoacidosis  with  a  β-hydroxybutyrate 
concentration  of  15  mmol/L,  arterial  pH  would  fall  to  7.40,  the

METABOLIC ACIDOSIS
Metabolic  acidosis  can  occur  because  of  an  increase  in  endogenous 
acid production (such as lactate and ketoacids), loss of bicarbonate (as 
in diarrhea), or accumulation of endogenous acids because of inappro-
priately low excretion of net acid by the kidney (as in chronic kidney 
disease).  Metabolic  acidosis  has  profound  effects  on  the  respiratory, 
cardiac, and nervous systems. The fall in blood pH is accompanied by a 
characteristic increase in ventilation, especially the tidal volume (Kuss-
maul respiration). Intrinsic cardiac contractility may be depressed, but 
inotropic  function  can  be  normal  because  of  catecholamine  release. 
Both peripheral arterial vasodilation and central venoconstriction may 
be present; the decrease in central and pulmonary vascular compliance 
predisposes to pulmonary edema with even minimal volume overload. 
CNS  function  is  depressed,  with  headache,  lethargy,  stupor,  and,  in 
some cases, even coma. Glucose intolerance may also occur.

There  are  two  major  categories  of  clinical  metabolic  acidosis: 
high-AG and non-AG acidosis (Table 55-3 and Table 55-4). The pres-
ence of metabolic acidosis, a normal AG, and hyperchloremia denotes 
the presence of a non-AG metabolic acidosis.

quently, patients with a non-AG acidosis (hyperchloremic acidosis) 
or an AG acidosis attributable to a nonmetabolizable anion due to 
advanced  kidney  failure  (“uremic”  acidosis)  should  receive  alkali 
therapy,  either  PO  (NaHCO3  tablets  or  Shohl’s  solution)  or  IV 
(NaHCO3), in an amount necessary to slowly increase the plasma 
−] to a target value of 22 mmol/L. Importantly, overcorrec-
[HCO3
tion should be avoided.

Bicarbonate therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is reserved 
for adult patients with severe acidemia (pH <7.00) and/or evidence 
of shock. In such circumstances, bicarbonate may be administered 
IV, as a slow infusion of 50 meq of NaHCO3 diluted in 300 mL of 
a saline solution, over 30–45 min, during the initial 1–2 h of ther-
apy.  Bolus  administration  should  be  avoided.  Administration  of 
NaHCO3 requires careful monitoring of plasma electrolytes during 
the course of therapy because of the risk for hypokalemia as urine 
output is established. A reasonable initial goal in DKA is to increase 
−] to 10–12 mmol/L and the pH to approximately 7.20, 
the [HCO3
but clearly not to increase these values to normal.

 ■ HIGH-ANION GAP ACIDOSES

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
High-Anion Gap Acidoses

There  are  four  principal  causes  of  a  high-AG  acidosis:  (1)  lactic 
acidosis,  (2)  ketoacidosis,  (3)  ingested  toxins,  and  (4)  acute  and 
chronic kidney failure (Table 55-4). Initial screening to differentiate 
the high-AG acidoses should include (1) a probe of the history for 
evidence of drug and toxin ingestion and measurement of arterial 
blood gas to detect coexistent respiratory alkalosis (salicylates); (2) 
determination of whether a history of diabetes mellitus is present 
(DKA); (3) a search for evidence of alcoholism or increased levels 
of  β-hydroxybutyrate  (alcoholic  ketoacidosis);  (4)  observation  for 
clinical signs of uremia and determination of the blood urea nitro-
gen (BUN) and creatinine (uremic acidosis); (5) inspection of the 
urine for oxalate crystals (ethylene glycol ingestion); and (6) recog-
nition of the numerous clinical settings in which lactate levels may 
be increased (hypotension, shock, cardiac failure, leukemia, cancer, 
and drug or toxin ingestion).

Lactic Acidosis  An increase in plasma l-lactate may be secondary 
to  poor  tissue  perfusion  (type  A)—circulatory  insufficiency  (shock, 
cardiac  failure),  severe  anemia,  mitochondrial  enzyme  defects,  and 
inhibitors (carbon monoxide, cyanide)—or to aerobic disorders (type 
B)—malignancies, nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
in HIV, diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic failure, thiamine deficiency, 
severe  infections  (cholera,  malaria),  seizures,  or  drugs/toxins  (bigua-
nides,  ethanol,  and  the  toxic  alcohols:  ethylene  glycol,  methanol, 
or  propylene  glycol).  Unrecognized  bowel  ischemia  or  infarction 
in  a  patient  with  severe  atherosclerosis  or  cardiac  decompensation 
receiving vasopressors is a common cause of lactic acidosis in elderly 
patients.  Pyroglutamic  acidemia  may  occur  in  critically  ill  patients

receiving  acetaminophen,  which  causes  depletion  of  glutathione  and 
accumulation  of  5-oxyprolene.  d-Lactic  acid  acidosis,  which  may  be 
associated with jejunoileal bypass, short bowel syndrome, or intestinal 
obstruction, is due to formation of d-lactate by gut bacteria.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
l-Lactic Acid Acidosis

The overarching goal of treatment is to correct the underlying con-
dition that disrupts lactate metabolism; tissue perfusion should be 
restored when inadequate, but vasoconstrictors should be avoided, 
or  used  cautiously,  because  they  may  worsen  tissue  perfusion. 
Alkali  therapy  is  generally  advocated  for  acute,  severe  acidemia 
(pH <7.00) to improve cardiovascular function. However, NaHCO3 
therapy may paradoxically depress cardiac performance and exac-
− stimulates 
erbate acidosis by enhancing lactate production (HCO3
phosphofructokinase).  While  the  use  of  alkali  in  moderate  lactic 
acidosis  is  controversial,  it  is  generally  agreed  that  attempts  to 
−] to normal by administration of exoge-
return the pH or [HCO3
nous NaHCO3 are deleterious. A reasonable approach with severe 
acidemia is to infuse sufficient NaHCO3 to raise arterial pH to no 
more than 7.2 or the [HCO3

–] to no more than 12 mmol/L.

NaHCO3  therapy  can  cause  fluid  overload,  hypercapnia,  and 
hypertension  because  the  amount  required  can  be  massive  when 
accumulation  of  lactic  acid  is  relentless.  Fluid  administration  is 
poorly  tolerated,  especially  in  the  oliguric  patient,  when  central 
venoconstriction  coexists.  If  the  underlying  cause  of  the  lactic 
− 
acidosis can be remedied, blood lactate will be converted to HCO3
and may result in an overshoot alkalosis if exogenous NaHCO3 has 
been administered excessively.

Ketoacidosis  •  DIABETIC  KETOACIDOSIS  (DKA)  This  condition 
is caused by increased fatty acid metabolism and the accumulation of 
ketoacids  (acetoacetate  and  β-hydroxybutyrate).  DKA  usually  occurs 
in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in association with cessation of 
insulin or an intercurrent illness such as an infection, gastroenteritis, 
pancreatitis, or myocardial infarction, which increases insulin require-
ments temporarily and acutely, and is characterized by hyperglycemia, 
ketonemia, and a high-AG acidosis. Nevertheless, the plasma glucose 
may  be  normal  or  only  slightly  elevated  in  the  setting  of  starvation 
ketoacidosis or in diabetics receiving antagonists of the proximal tubule 
sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). These agents cause glyco-
suria, an osmotic diuresis, and lower the plasma glucose. Ketoacidosis 
can occur in patients receiving SGLT2 antagonists for the same reasons 
as in classical DKA, but the plasma glucose is typically normal or only 
slightly elevated. The accumulation of ketoacids in plasma accounts for 
the increment in the AG in both classical DKA and euglycemic DKA. 
Measurement of urine ketones (by the dipstick nitroprusside reaction) 
does not detect β-hydroxybutyrate and may underestimate the degree 
of  ketosis  (see  below).  Excretion  of  ketoacids  obligates  the  excretion 
of cations, such as Na+ and K+, contributing to volume depletion and 
Cl– retention. In some circumstances, a mixed non-AG–high-AG aci-
– 
dosis may occur simultaneously and is recognized when the ΔHCO3
exceeds the ΔAG. It should be noted that bicarbonate therapy is rarely 
necessary in DKA except with extreme acidemia (pH <7.00) or if the 
patient is in shock. If administered, NaHCO3 should be administered 
in only limited amounts because of the risk for cerebral edema. Patients 
with  DKA  are  typically  volume  depleted  and  require  fluid  resuscita-
tion  with  isotonic  saline.  Volume  overexpansion  should  be  avoided, 
however,  because  overly  aggressive  saline  administration  may  cause 
hyperchloremic acidosis during or following treatment of DKA. Reg-
ular insulin should be administered IV as an initial bolus of 0.1 U/kg 
followed by an infusion of 0.1 U/kg/h until the AG returns to normal; 
see Chap. 403 for more detail.

ALCOHOLIC  KETOACIDOSIS  (AKA)  AKA  is  usually  associated  with 
chronic  alcoholism,  binge  drinking,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain,  poor 

nutrition, and volume depletion. The glucose concentration is variable, 
and acidosis may be severe because of elevated ketones, predominantly 
β-hydroxybutyrate. The presence of a high-AG acidosis, in the absence 
of  hyperglycemia,  in  a  patient  with  chronic  alcoholism  suggests  the 
diagnosis  of  AKA.  Mixed  acid-base  disorders  are  common  in  AKA. 
Hypoperfusion  may  enhance  lactic  acid  production  (mixed  high-AG 
acidosis),  chronic  respiratory  alkalosis  may  accompany  liver  disease 
(mixed  high-AG  acidosis  and  respiratory  alkalosis),  and  metabolic 
alkalosis  can  result  from  vomiting  (mixed  high-AG  acidosis  and 
−).  As  the  circulation  is 
metabolic  alkalosis:  ΔAG  exceeds  ΔHCO3
restored by administration of IV fluids, the preferential accumulation 
of β-hydroxybutyrate is then shifted to acetoacetate. This explains the 
common clinical observation of an increasingly positive nitroprusside 
reaction  (ketones)  as  the  circulation  is  restored.  The  nitroprusside 
reaction  can  detect  acetoacetic  acid  but  not  β-hydroxybutyrate,  so 
that  the  degree  of  ketosis  and  ketonuria  can  not  only  change  with 
therapy, but can be underestimated initially. Therefore, the plasma β- 
hydroxybutyrate level should be measured. Patients with AKA usually 
present  with  relatively  normal  renal  function,  as  opposed  to  DKA, 
where renal function is often compromised because of volume deple-
tion  (osmotic  diuresis)  or  diabetic  nephropathy.  The  AKA  patient 
with  normal  renal  function  may  excrete  relatively  large  quantities  of 
ketoacids and retain Cl– and, therefore, may have a mixed high-AG–
non-AG metabolic acidosis (ΔHCO3

− exceeds ΔAG).

TREATMENT
Alcoholic Ketoacidosis

Extracellular  fluid  deficits  almost  always  accompany  AKA  and 
should  be  repaired  by  IV  administration,  initially,  of  saline  and 
glucose (5% dextrose in 0.9% NaCl). Hypophosphatemia, hypoka-
lemia, and hypomagnesemia may coexist and should be monitored 
carefully  and  corrected  when  indicated.  Hypophosphatemia  may 
emerge 12–24 h after admission, exacerbated by glucose infusion, 
and,  if  severe,  may  induce  marked  muscle  weakness,  hemoly-
sis,  rhabdomyolysis,  or  respiratory  arrest.  Upper  gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage,  pancreatitis,  and  pneumonia  may  accompany  this 
disorder.

Drug- and Toxin-Induced Acidosis  •  SALICYLATES 
(See also 
Chap. 458) Salicylate intoxication in adults usually causes respiratory 
alkalosis or a mixture of high-AG metabolic acidosis and respiratory 
alkalosis.  Only  a  portion  of  the  AG  is  due  to  salicylates.  Lactic  acid 
production is also often increased.

TREATMENT
Salicylate-Induced Acidosis

Vigorous gastric lavage with isotonic saline (not NaHCO3) should be 
initiated immediately. All patients should receive at least one round 
of  activated  charcoal  per  nasogastric  tube  (1  g/kg  up  to  50  g).  To 
facilitate excretion of salicylate in the acidotic patient, IV NaHCO3 
is administered in amounts adequate to alkalinize the urine (urine 
pH >7.5) and to maintain urine output. Raising urine pH from 6.5 
to 7.5 increases salicylate clearance fivefold. Patients with coexist-
ing respiratory alkalosis should also receive NaHCO3 cautiously to 
avoid excessive alkalemia. Acetazolamide may be administered in 
the face of alkalemia, when an alkaline diuresis cannot be achieved, 
or to ameliorate volume overload associated with NaHCO3 admin-
istration.  Acetazolamide  may  cause  systemic  metabolic  acidosis  if 
− is not replaced, a circumstance that can mark-
the excreted HCO3
edly  reduce  salicylate  clearance.  Hypokalemia  should  be  antic-
ipated  with  vigorous  bicarbonate  therapy  and  should  be  treated 
promptly  and  aggressively.  Glucose-containing  fluids  should  be 
administered  because  of  the  danger  of  hypoglycemia.  Excessive 
insensible  fluid  losses  may  cause  severe  volume  depletion  and

hypernatremia. If renal failure prevents rapid clearance of salicylate, 
hemodialysis should be performed against a standard bicarbonate 
dialysate ([HCO3

–] = 30–35 meq/L).

TREATMENT
Methanol Intoxication

ALCOHOLS  Under  most  physiologic  conditions,  sodium,  urea,  and 
glucose generate the osmotic pressure of blood. Plasma osmolality is 
calculated according to the following expression: Posm = 2Na+ + Glu +  
BUN (all in mmol/L), or, using conventional laboratory values in which 
glucose  and  BUN  are  expressed  in  mg/dL:  Posm  =  2Na+  +  Glu/18  +  
BUN/2.8.  The  calculated  and  determined  osmolality  should  agree 
within 10–15 mmol/kg H2O. When the measured osmolality exceeds 
the  calculated  osmolality  by  >10–15  mmol/kg  H2O,  one  of  two  cir-
cumstances  prevails.  Either  the  serum  sodium  is  spuriously  low,  as 
with  hyperlipidemia  or  hyperproteinemia  (pseudohyponatremia),  or 
osmolytes other than sodium salts, glucose, or urea have accumulated 
in plasma. Examples of such osmolytes include mannitol, radiocontrast 
media,  ethanol,  isopropyl  alcohol,  ethylene  glycol,  propylene  glycol, 
methanol,  and  acetone.  In  this  situation,  the  difference  between  the 
calculated  osmolality  and  the  measured  osmolality  (osmolar  gap)  is 
proportional to the concentration of the unmeasured solute. With an 
appropriate  clinical  history  and  index  of  suspicion,  identification  of 
an osmolar gap is helpful in identifying the presence of toxic alcohol- 
associated  AG  acidosis.  Three  alcohols  may  cause  fatal  intoxications: 
ethylene glycol, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol. All cause an elevated 
osmolal gap, but only the first two cause a high-AG acidosis. Isopropyl 
alcohol  ingestion  does  not  typically  elevate  the  AG  unless  extreme 
overdose causes hypotension and lactic acid acidosis.
ETHYLENE GLYCOL  (See also Chap. 458) Ethylene glycol (EG) (com-
monly used in antifreeze, but also in brake fluid and windshield washer 
fluid deicers) is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase, and ingestion 
of  EG  leads  to  a  metabolic  acidosis  and  severe  damage  to  the  CNS, 
heart,  lungs,  and  kidneys.  The  combination  of  both  a  high  AG  and 
osmolar gap is highly suspicious for EG or methanol intoxication. The 
combination of a high AG and high osmolar gap in a patient suspected 
of  EG  ingestion  should  be  taken  as  evidence  of  EG  toxicity  prior  to 
measurement of EG levels, and treatment should not be delayed. The 
osmolar gap may be elevated earlier than the AG, and as the osmolar 
gap declines, the AG increases. The increased AG and osmolar gap in 
EG  intoxication  are  attributable  to  EG  and  its  metabolites,  glycolate, 
oxalate, and other organic acids. Lactic acid production increases sec-
ondary to inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and altered intra-
cellular redox state and may contribute to the high AG. Acute tubule 
injury is caused initially by glycolate and later is amplified by tubule 
obstruction from oxalate crystals.

TREATMENT
Ethylene Glycol Intoxication

This includes the prompt institution of IV isotonic fluids, thiamine 
and pyridoxine supplements, fomepizole, and usually, hemodialysis. 
Both  fomepizole  and  ethanol  compete  with  EG  for  metabolism  by 
alcohol dehydrogenase. Fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole; 15 mg/kg IV 
over 30 min as a loading dose, then 10 mg/kg for four doses every 
12 h) is the agent of choice and offers the advantages of a predictable 
decline  in  EG  levels  without  excessive  obtundation,  as  seen  during 
ethyl alcohol infusion. Fomepizole should be continued until blood 
pH is normal or the osmolar gap is <10 mOsm/kg H2O. Hemodialysis 
is indicated when the arterial pH is <7.3, a high-AG acidosis is pres-
ent, the osmolar gap exceeds 20 mOsm/kg H2O, or there is evidence 
of end organ damage such as CNS manifestations and kidney failure.

METHANOL  (See also Chap. 458) The ingestion of methanol (wood 
alcohol)  causes  metabolic  acidosis,  and  its  metabolites  formaldehyde 
and formic acid cause severe optic nerve and CNS damage. Lactic acid, 
ketoacids, and other unidentified organic acids may contribute to the 
acidosis.  Due  to  its  low  molecular  mass  (32  Da),  an  osmolar  gap  is 
present and may precede the elevation of the AG.

Treatment of methanol intoxication is similar to that for EG intox-
ication,  including  general  supportive  measures,  fomepizole,  and 
hemodialysis.

PROPYLENE GLYCOL  Propylene glycol is the vehicle used in IV admin-
istration of diazepam, lorazepam, phenobarbital, nitroglycerine, etomi-
date, enoximone, and phenytoin. Propylene glycol is generally safe for 
limited use in these IV preparations, but toxicity has been reported in 
the setting of the intensive care unit in patients receiving frequent or 
continuous therapy, where the propylene glycol vehicle may accumu-
late in the plasma. This form of high-gap acidosis should be considered 
in  patients  with  unexplained  high-gap  acidosis,  hyperosmolality,  and 
clinical deterioration, especially in the setting of treatment for alcohol 
withdrawal. Propylene glycol, like EG and methanol, is metabolized by 
alcohol dehydrogenase. With intoxication by propylene glycol, the first 
response  is  to  stop  the  offending  infusion.  Additionally,  fomepizole 
should also be administered in acidotic patients.
ISOPROPYL  ALCOHOL  Ingested  isopropanol  is  absorbed  rapidly  and 
may be fatal when as little as 150 mL of rubbing alcohol, solvent, or 
deicer  is  consumed.  A  plasma  level  >400  mg/dL  is  life-threatening. 
Isopropyl alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetone. 
The characteristic features differ significantly from EG and methanol 
intoxication in that the parent compound, not the metabolites, causes 
toxicity, and a high-AG acidosis is not present because acetone is rap-
idly excreted. Both isopropyl alcohol and acetone increase the osmolar 
gap,  and  hypoglycemia  is  common.  Alternative  diagnoses  should  be 
considered if the patient does not improve significantly within a few 
hours. Patients with hemodynamic instability with plasma levels above 
400 mg/dL should be considered for hemodialysis.

TREATMENT
Isopropyl Alcohol Toxicity

Isopropanol  alcohol  toxicity  is  treated  by  supportive  therapy,  IV 
fluids,  pressors,  ventilatory  support  if  needed,  and  acute  hemo-
dialysis  for  prolonged  coma,  hemodynamic  instability,  or  levels   
>400 mg/dL.

PYROGLUTAMIC  ACID  Acetaminophen-induced  high-AG  metabolic 
acidosis is uncommon but is recognized in either patients with acet-
aminophen overdose or malnourished or critically ill patients receiving 
acetaminophen  in  typical  dosage.  5-Oxoproline  accumulation  after 
acetaminophen should be suspected in the setting of an unexplained 
high-AG  acidosis  without  elevation  of  the  osmolar  gap  in  patients 
receiving acetaminophen. The first step in treatment is to immediately 
discontinue  acetaminophen.  Additionally,  sodium  bicarbonate  IV 
should  be  given.  Although  N-acetylcysteine  has  been  suggested,  it  is 
not proven that it hastens the metabolism of 5-oxoproline by increasing 
intracellular glutathione concentrations in this setting, as assumed.

Chronic  Kidney  Disease 
(See  also  Chap.  311)  The  hyperchlo-
remic  acidosis  of  moderate  chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD;  stage  3)  is 
eventually converted to the high-AG acidosis of advanced renal failure 
(stages  4  and  5  CKD).  Poor  filtration  and  reabsorption  of  organic 
anions contribute to the pathogenesis. As renal disease progresses, the 
number  of  functioning  nephrons  eventually  becomes  insufficient  to 
keep pace with net acid production. Uremic acidosis in advanced CKD 
+ production and 
is characterized, therefore, by a reduced rate of NH4
excretion.  Alkaline  salts  from  bone  buffer  the  acid  retained  in  CKD. 
Despite  significant  retention  of  acid  (up  to  20  mmol/d),  the  serum 
−] does not typically decrease further, indicating participation of 
[HCO3
buffers outside the extracellular compartment. Therefore, the trade-off 
in untreated chronic metabolic acidosis of CKD stages 3 and 4 is sig-
nificant loss of bone mass due to reduction in bone calcium carbonate.

Chronic acidosis also contributes significantly to muscle wasting and 
disability in advancing CKD.

TREATMENT
Metabolic Acidosis of Chronic Kidney Disease

Because of the association of metabolic acidosis in advanced CKD 
with muscle catabolism, bone disease, and more rapid progression 
of CKD, both the “uremic acidosis” of end-stage renal disease and 
the non-AG metabolic acidosis of stages 3 and 4 CKD require oral 
−] to a value  
alkali replacement to increase and maintain the [HCO3
>22  mmol/L.  This  can  be  accomplished  with  relatively  modest 
amounts of alkali (1.0–1.5 mmol/kg body weight per day) and has 
been shown to slow the progression of CKD. Either NaHCO3 tablets 
(650-mg tablets contain 7.8 meq) or oral sodium citrate (Shohl’s solu-
tion) is effective. Moreover, addition of fruits and vegetables (citrate) 
to the diet may increase the plasma [HCO3

–] and slow progression.

 ■ NON–ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSES
Alkali can be lost from the gastrointestinal tract as a result of diarrhea 
or  from  the  kidneys  due  to  renal  tubular  abnormalities  (e.g.,  renal 
tubular  acidosis  [RTA]).  In  these  disorders  (Table  55-5),  reciprocal

(UAG): UAG = [Na+ + K+]u – [Cl−]u. When [Cl−]u > [Na+ + K+]u, the 
UAG is negative by definition. This suggests that the urine ammonium 
level is appropriately increased, suggesting an extrarenal cause of the 
acidosis. Conversely, when the UAG is positive, the urine ammonium 
level is predictably low, suggesting a renal tubular origin of the acido-
sis.  Recent  studies  have  shown  a  poor  correlation  between  the  UAG 
and  the  measured  urine  ammonium,  thus  calling  the  estimation  of 
urine ammonium by calculation of the UAG into question. Therefore, 
clinical  laboratories  should  be  encouraged  to  measure  urine  ammo-
nium  by  adaptation  of  automated  plasma  ammonium  assays,  using 
the enzymatic method, if the urine sample is diluted 1:200 in normal

Proximal RTA (type 2 RTA) (Chap. 315) is most often due to gen-
eralized proximal tubular dysfunction manifested by glycosuria, gen-
eralized aminoaciduria, and phosphaturia (Fanconi syndrome). When

The typical findings in acquired or inherited forms of classic distal 
RTA (type 1 RTA) include hypokalemia, a non-AG metabolic acido-
+]), 
sis,  low  urinary  NH4
and  inappropriately  high  urine  pH  (pH  >5.5).  Most  patients  have 
hypocitraturia  and  hypercalciuria;  nephrolithiasis,  nephrocalcinosis, 
and  bone  disease  are  common.  In  generalized  distal  RTA  (type  4 
RTA),  hyperkalemia  is  disproportionate  to  the  reduction  in  glomer-
ular filtration rate (GFR) because of coexisting dysfunction of potas-
sium  and  acid  secretion.  Urinary  ammonium  excretion  is  invariably 
depressed,  and  kidney  function  may  be  compromised  secondary  to 
diabetic  nephropathy,  obstructive  uropathy,  or  chronic  tubulointer-
stitial disease.

Hyporeninemic  hypoaldosteronism  typically  presents  as  a  non-AG 
metabolic acidosis in older adults with diabetes mellitus or tubulointer-
stitial disease and CKD (estimated GFR 20–50 mL/min) with hyperka-
lemia ([K+] 5.2–6.0 mmol/L), concurrent hypertension, and congestive 
heart failure. Both the metabolic acidosis and the hyperkalemia are out 
of proportion to impairment in GFR. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs,  trimethoprim,  pentamidine,  angiotensin-converting  enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can also 
increase the risk for hyperkalemia and a non-AG metabolic acidosis in 
patients with CKD, especially from diabetic nephropathy (Table 55-5).

TREATMENT
Non–Anion Gap Metabolic Acidoses

For  non-AG  acidosis  due  to  gastrointestinal  losses  of  bicarbonate, 
NaHCO3 may be administered intravenously or orally, as determined 
by the severity of both the acidosis and the accompanying volume 
depletion. Proximal RTA is the most challenging of the RTAs to treat

if the goal is to restore the serum [HCO3

and potassium. In patients with proximal RTA (type 2), potassium

and potassium citrate (citric acid 334 mg, sodium citrate 500 mg, 
and  potassium  citrate  550  mg  per  5  mL)  may  be  prescribed  for 
this purpose (Virtrate or Cytra-3). In classical distal RTA (type 1), 
hypokalemia should be corrected first. When accomplished, alkali 
therapy  with  either  sodium  citrate  (Shohl’s  solution)  or  NaHCO3 
tablets  (650-mg  tablets  contain  7.8  meq)  should  be  initiated  to

correct  and  maintain  the  serum  [HCO3
meq/L.  Type  1  RTA  patients  typically  respond  to  chronic  alkali 
therapy readily, and the benefits of adequate alkali therapy include 
a decrease in the frequency of nephrolithiasis, improvement in bone 
density,  resumption  of  normal  growth  patterns  in  children,  and 
preservation  of  kidney  function  in  both  adults  and  children.  For 
type 4 RTA, attention must be paid to the dual goals of correction 
of the metabolic acidosis, using the same approach as for classical 
distal  renal  tubular  acidosis  (type  1  RTA),  and  also  correction  of 
the plasma [K+]. Restoration of normokalemia increases urinary net 
acid excretion and consequently can greatly improve the metabolic 
acidosis.  Chronic  administration  of  oral  sodium  polystyrene  sul-
fonate (15 g of power prepared as an oral solution, without sorbitol, 
once daily 2–3 times per week) is sometimes used but is unpalat-
able, and patient compliance is low. The nonabsorbed, calcium-po-
tassium cation exchange polymer, patiromer, may be considered for 
type 4 RTA patients with hyperkalemia because it is more palatable. 
It  is  administered  as  8.4-g  packets  of  powder  for  suspension  PO 
twice daily with dose adjustment at weekly intervals, based on the 
plasma [K+], not to exceed 25.2 g/d. Additionally, the diet should be 
low in potassium-containing foods or supplements (salt substitute), 
all  potassium-retaining  medications  should  be  discontinued,  and 
a  loop  diuretic  may  be  administered.  Finally,  patients  with  docu-
mented isolated hypoaldosteronism should receive fludrocortisone, 
but the dose varies with the cause of the hormone deficiency. This 
agent should be administered very cautiously and in combination 
with furosemide in patients with edema and hypertension because 
of possible aggravation of these conditions.

METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
Metabolic  alkalosis  is  established  by  an  elevated  arterial  pH,  an 
−], and an increase in Paco2 as a result of 
increase in the serum [HCO3
compensatory alveolar hypoventilation (Table 55-1). It is often accom-
panied by hypochloremia and hypokalemia. The elevation in arterial 
pH  establishes  the  diagnosis  because  pH  is  decreased  in  respiratory 
acidosis, even though both have an elevated Paco2. Metabolic alkalosis 
frequently  occurs  as  a  mixed  acid-base  disorder  in  association  with 
either respiratory acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, or metabolic acidosis.

 ■ ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
−] or loss of 
Metabolic alkalosis occurs as a result of net gain of [HCO3
nonvolatile acid (usually HCl by vomiting) from the extracellular fluid. 
− secretion 
When vomiting causes loss of HCl from the stomach, HCO3
−  is  retained 
cannot  be  initiated  in  the  small  bowel,  and  thus,  HCO3
in the extracellular fluid. Thus, vomiting or nasogastric suction is an 
example of the generation stage of metabolic alkalosis, in which the loss 
of acid typically causes alkalosis. Upon cessation of vomiting, the main-
tenance  stage  ensues  because  secondary  factors  prevent  the  kidneys 
from excreting HCO3

− appropriately.

Maintenance  of  metabolic  alkalosis,  therefore,  represents  a  failure 
− from the extracellular com-
of the kidneys to eliminate excess HCO3
partment. The kidneys will retain, rather than excrete, the excess alkali 
and maintain the alkalosis if (1) volume deficiency, chloride deficiency, 
and K+ deficiency exist in combination with a reduced GFR (associated 
with a low urine [Cl–]) or (2) hypokalemia exists because of autono-
mous  hyperaldosteronism  (normal  urine  [Cl–]).  In  the  first  example, 
saline-responsive metabolic alkalosis is corrected by extracellular fluid 
volume  (ECFV)  restoration  (IV  administration  of  NaCl  and  KCl), 
whereas,  in  the  latter,  it  may  be  necessary  to  repair  the  alkalosis  by 
pharmacologic or surgical intervention, not with saline administration 
(saline-unresponsive metabolic alkalosis).

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
To establish the cause of metabolic alkalosis (Table 55-6), it is neces-
sary to assess the status of the ECFV, the recumbent and upright blood 
pressure  (to  determine  if  orthostasis  is  present),  the  serum  [K+],  the 
urine [Cl–], and in some circumstances, the renin-aldosterone system. 
For example, the presence of chronic hypertension and chronic hypo-
kalemia in an alkalotic patient suggests either mineralocorticoid excess 
or that the hypertensive patient is receiving diuretics. Low plasma renin 
activity and values for urine [Cl−] >20 meq/L in a patient who is not 
taking diuretics suggest primary mineralocorticoid excess. The combi-
nation of hypokalemia and alkalosis in a normotensive, nonedematous 
patient  can  be  due  to  Bartter’s  or  Gitelman’s  syndrome,  magnesium 
deficiency, vomiting, exogenous alkali, or diuretic ingestion. Measure-
ment of urine electrolytes (especially the urine [Cl−]) and screening of 
the urine for diuretics are recommended. If the urine is alkaline, with 
an  elevated  [Na+]u  and  [K+]u  but  low  [Cl−]u,  the  diagnosis  is  usually

either vomiting (overt or surreptitious) or alkali ingestion. If the urine 
is relatively acid with low concentrations of Na+, K+, and Cl−, the most 
likely  possibilities  are  prior  vomiting,  the  posthypercapnic  state,  or 
prior diuretic ingestion. If the urine sodium, potassium, and chloride 
concentrations  are  not  depressed,  magnesium  deficiency,  Bartter’s  or 
Gitelman’s syndrome, or current diuretic ingestion should be consid-
ered. Bartter’s syndrome is distinguished from Gitelman’s syndrome by 
the presence of hypocalciuria in the latter disorder.

+  (ammoniagenesis)  is  upregulated  directly 
renal  generation  of  NH4
by  hypokalemia.  Chronic  K+  deficiency  also  upregulates  the  H+,  K+- 
ATPases in the distal tubule and collecting duct to increase K+ absorp-
tion while simultaneously increasing H+ secretion. Alkalosis associated 
with severe K+ depletion is resistant to salt administration, but repair 
of the K+ deficiency corrects the alkalosis. Potassium depletion often 
occurs  concurrent  with  magnesium  deficiency  in  alcoholics  with 
malnutrition.

Alkali Administration  Chronic  administration  of  alkali  to  indi-
viduals  with  normal  renal  function  rarely  causes  alkalosis.  However, 
in patients with coexistent hemodynamic disturbances associated with 
effective  ECFV  depletion  (e.g.,  heart  failure),  alkalosis  can  develop 
−  or  enhanced  reab-
because  of  diminished  capacity  to  excrete  HCO3
−. Such patients include those who receive NaHCO3 
sorption of HCO3
(PO  or  IV),  citrate  loads  IV  (transfusions  of  whole  blood,  or  thera-
peutic apheresis), or antacids plus cation-exchange resins (aluminum 
hydroxide and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). Nursing home patients 
receiving  enteral  tube  feedings  have  a  higher  incidence  of  metabolic 
alkalosis than nursing home patients receiving regular diets.

 ■ METABOLIC ALKALOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH ECFV 
CONTRACTION, K+ DEPLETION, AND SECONDARY 
HYPERRENINEMIC HYPERALDOSTERONISM
Gastrointestinal Origin  Gastrointestinal loss of H+ from vomit-
− into 
ing or gastric aspiration causes simultaneous addition of HCO3
the  extracellular  fluid.  During  active  vomiting,  the  filtered  load  of 
bicarbonate reaching the kidneys is acutely increased and will exceed 
−  absorp-
the  reabsorptive  capacity  of  the  proximal  tubule  for  HCO3
– to the distal nephron, 
tion. Subsequently, enhanced delivery of HCO3
–  reabsorption  is  lower,  will  result  in 
where  the  capacity  for  HCO3

vomiting  ceases,  the  persistence  of  volume,  potassium,  and  chloride 
depletion  triggers  maintenance  of  the  alkalosis  because  these  con-

ditions  promote  HCO3
ECFV with NaCl and repair of K+ deficits with KCl corrects the acid-
base disorder by restoring the ability of the kidney to excrete the excess 
bicarbonate.

Renal Origin  •  DIURETICS 
(See also Chap. 258) Diuretics such 
as  thiazides  and  loop  diuretics  (furosemide,  bumetanide,  torsemide)

because the reduced ECFV “contracts” around the [HCO3
(contraction alkalosis). The chronic administration of diuretics tends 
to generate an alkalosis by increasing distal salt delivery so that both K+ 
and H+ secretion are stimulated. The alkalosis is maintained by persis-
tence of the contraction of the ECFV, secondary hyperaldosteronism, 
K+ deficiency, and the direct effect of the diuretic (as long as diuretic 
administration  continues).  Discontinuing  the  diuretic  and  providing 
isotonic saline to correct the ECFV deficit will repair the alkalosis.

SOLUTE LOSING DISORDERS: BARTTER’S SYNDROME AND GITELMAN’S 
SYNDROME  See Chap. 315.

NON-REABSORBABLE  ANIONS  AND  MAGNESIUM  DEFICIENCY  
Administration of large quantities of the penicillin derivatives carbe-
nicillin or ticarcillin cause their non-reabsorbable anions to appear in 
the distal tubule. This increases the transepithelial potential difference 
in  the  collecting  tubule  and  thereby  enhances  H+  and  K+  secretion. 
Mg2+  deficiency  may  occur  with  chronic  administration  of  thiazide 
diuretics, alcoholism, and malnutrition, and in Gitelman’s syndrome, 
it potentiates the development of hypokalemic alkalosis by enhancing 
distal acidification through stimulation of renin and hence aldosterone 
secretion.

dietary potassium insufficiency, diuretics, or alcohol abuse may initi-

 ■ METABOLIC ALKALOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH 
ECFV EXPANSION, HYPERTENSION, AND 
MINERALOCORTICOID EXCESS
Increased aldosterone levels may be the result of autonomous primary 
adrenal  overproduction  or  of  secondary  aldosterone  release  due  to 
renal overproduction of renin. Mineralocorticoid excess increases net 
acid excretion and may result in metabolic alkalosis, which is typically 
exacerbated by associated K+ deficiency. Salt retention and hyperten-
sion are due to upregulation of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in 
the collecting tubule in response to aldosterone. The kaliuresis persists 
because of mineralocorticoid excess and stimulation of ENaC, causing 
an  increase  in  transepithelial  voltage,  which  enhances  K+  excretion. 
Persistent K+ depletion may cause polydipsia and polyuria.

Liddle’s  syndrome  (Chap.  315)  results  from  an  inherited  gain-of-
function mutation of genes that regulate the collecting duct Na+ channel, 
ENaC. This rare monogenic form of hypertension is the result of volume 
expansion  that  secondarily  suppresses  aldosterone  elaboration.  Patients 
typically present with hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

Symptoms  With metabolic alkalosis, changes in CNS and periph-
eral  nervous  system  function  are  similar  to  those  of  hypocalcemia 
(Chap.  409);  symptoms  include  mental  confusion;  obtundation;  and 
a predisposition to seizures, paresthesias, muscular cramping, tetany, 
aggravation of arrhythmias, and hypoxemia in chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease. Related electrolyte abnormalities include hypokalemia 
and hypophosphatemia.

TREATMENT
Metabolic Alkalosis

The first goal of therapy is to correct the underlying stimulus for 
−  generation.  If  primary  aldosteronism  or  Cushing’s  syn-
HCO3
drome  is  present,  correction  of  the  underlying  cause  will  reverse 
the  hypokalemia  and  alkalosis.  [H+]  loss  by  the  stomach  or  kid-
neys  can  be  mitigated  by  the  use  of  proton  pump  inhibitors  or 
the  discontinuation  of  diuretics.  The  second  aspect  of  treatment 
is  to  eliminate  factors  that  sustain  the  inappropriate  increase  in 
− reabsorption, such as ECFV contraction or K+ deficiency. 
HCO3
K+  deficits  should  always  be  repaired.  Isotonic  saline  is  recom-
mended to reverse the alkalosis when ECFV contraction is present. 
If associated conditions, such as congestive heart failure, preclude 
−  loss  can  be  accelerated 
infusion  of  isotonic  saline,  renal  HCO3
by  administration  of  acetazolamide  (125–250  mg  IV),  a  carbonic 
anhydrase inhibitor, which is usually effective in patients with ade-
quate renal function. However, acetazolamide triggers urinary K+

losses and may cause hypokalemia that should be corrected. Dilute 
hydrochloric acid IV (0.1 N HCl) has been advocated in extreme 
cases  of  metabolic  alkalosis  but  causes  hemolysis  and  must  be 
delivered slowly in a central vein. This preparation is not available 
generally and must be prepared in the pharmacy. Because serious 
errors or harm may occur, its use is not advised. Therapy in Liddle’s 
syndrome should include a potassium-sparing diuretic (amiloride 
or triamterene) to inhibit ENaC and correct both the hypertension 
and the hypokalemia.

RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS
Respiratory  acidosis  occurs  as  a  result  of  severe  pulmonary  disease, 
respiratory  muscle  fatigue,  or  abnormalities  in  ventilatory  control 
and  is  recognized  by  an  increase  in  Paco2  and  decrease  in  pH  
(Table 55-7). In acute respiratory acidosis, there is a compensatory ele-
− (due to cellular buffering mechanisms) that increases 
vation in HCO3
1 mmol/L for every 10-mmHg increase in Paco2. In chronic respiratory 
−] by 4 mmol/L 
acidosis (>24 h), renal adaptation increases the [HCO3
− usually does 
for every 10-mmHg increase in Paco2. The serum HCO3
not increase above 38 mmol/L.

The clinical features vary according to the severity and duration of 
the respiratory acidosis, the underlying disease, and whether there is 
accompanying hypoxemia. A rapid increase in Paco2 (acute hypercap-
nia) may cause anxiety, dyspnea, confusion, psychosis, and hallucina-
tions and may progress to coma. However, chronic hypercapnia may 
cause sleep disorders; loss of memory; daytime somnolence; personal-
ity changes; impairment of coordination; and motor disturbances such 
as  tremor,  myoclonic  jerks,  and  asterixis.  Headaches  and  other  signs 
that mimic raised intracranial pressure, such as papilledema, abnormal 
reflexes, and focal muscle weakness, are also seen.

Depression  of  the  respiratory  center  by  a  variety  of  drugs,  injury, 
or  disease  can  produce  respiratory  acidosis.  This  may  occur  acutely 
with  general  anesthetics,  sedatives,  and  head  trauma  or  chronically 
with  sedatives,  alcohol,  intracranial  tumors,  and  the  syndromes 
of  sleep-disordered  breathing  including  the  primary  alveolar  and  
obesity-hypoventilation  syndromes  (Chaps.  296  and  297).  Abnor-
malities  or  disease  in  the  motor  neurons,  neuromuscular  junction, 
and skeletal muscle can cause hypoventilation via respiratory muscle 
fatigue. Mechanical ventilation, when not properly adjusted, may result 
in  respiratory  acidosis,  particularly  if  CO2  production  suddenly  rises 
(because of fever, agitation, sepsis, or overfeeding) or alveolar ventila-
tion decreases because of worsening pulmonary function. High levels 
of positive end-expiratory pressure in the presence of reduced cardiac 
output may cause hypercapnia as a result of large increases in alveolar 
dead space (Chap. 285). Permissive hypercapnia may be used to min-
imize intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure in respiratory distress 
syndrome,  but  the  consequential  respiratory  acidosis  may  require 
administration of NaHCO3 to increase the arterial pH to approximately 
7.20, but not to the normal value.

Acute hypercapnia follows sudden occlusion of the upper airway 
or generalized bronchospasm as in severe asthma, anaphylaxis, inha-
lational  burn,  or  toxin  injury.  Chronic  hypercapnia  and  respiratory 
acidosis  occur  in  end-stage  obstructive  lung  disease.  Restrictive 
disorders involving both the chest wall and the lungs can cause respi-
ratory acidosis because the high metabolic cost of respiration causes 
ventilatory  muscle  fatigue.  Advanced  stages  of  intrapulmonary  and 
extrapulmonary  restrictive  defects  present  as  chronic  respiratory 
acidosis.

The diagnosis of respiratory acidosis requires the measurement of 
Paco2  and  arterial  pH.  A  detailed  history  and  physical  examination 
often  indicate  the  cause.  Pulmonary  function  studies  (Chap.  285), 
including  spirometry,  diffusion  capacity  for  carbon  monoxide,  lung 
volumes,  and  arterial  Paco2  and  O2  saturation,  usually  make  it  pos-
sible to determine if respiratory acidosis is secondary to lung disease. 
The workup for nonpulmonary causes should include a detailed drug 
history, measurement of hematocrit, and assessment of upper airway, 
chest wall, pleura, and neuromuscular function.

TREATMENT
Respiratory Acidosis

The  management  of  respiratory  acidosis  depends  on  its  severity 
and rate of onset. Acute respiratory acidosis can be life-threatening, 
and measures to reverse the underlying cause should be undertaken 
simultaneously with restoration of adequate alveolar ventilation. This

may necessitate tracheal intubation and assisted mechanical ventila-
tion. Oxygen administration should be titrated carefully in patients 
with severe obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic CO2 retention 
who are breathing spontaneously (Chap. 292). When oxygen is used 
injudiciously, these patients may experience progression of the respi-
ratory  acidosis  causing  severe  acidemia.  Aggressive  and  rapid  cor-
rection of hypercapnia should be avoided, because the falling Paco2 
may  provoke  the  same  complications  noted  with  acute  respiratory 
alkalosis  (i.e.,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  reduced  cerebral  perfusion,  and 
seizures). The Paco2 should be lowered gradually in chronic respira-
tory acidosis, aiming to restore the Paco2 to baseline levels and to pro-
−.
vide sufficient Cl− and K+ to enhance the renal excretion of HCO3

Chronic respiratory acidosis is frequently difficult to correct, but 
the  primary  goal  is  to  institute  measures  that  may  improve  lung 
function (Chap. 292).

RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS
−/
Alveolar hyperventilation decreases Paco2 and increases the HCO3
Paco2 ratio, thus increasing pH (Table 55-7). Nonbicarbonate cellular 
−.  Hypocapnia  develops  when 
buffers  respond  by  consuming  HCO3
a  sufficiently  strong  ventilatory  stimulus  causes  CO2  output  in  the 
lungs to exceed its metabolic production by tissues. Plasma pH and 
−] appear to vary proportionately with Paco2 over a range from  
[HCO3
40–15 mmHg. The relationship between arterial [H+] concentration 
and  Paco2  is  ∼0.7  mmol/L  per  mmHg  (or  0.01  pH  unit/mmHg), 
−] is 0.2 mmol/L per mmHg. Hypocapnia 
and that for plasma [HCO3
sustained  for  >2–6  h  is  further  compensated  by  a  decrease  in  renal 
ammonium and titratable acid excretion and a reduction in filtered 
−  reabsorption.  Full  renal  adaptation  to  respiratory  alkalosis 
HCO3
may take several days and requires normal volume status and renal 
function.  The  kidneys  appear  to  respond  directly  to  the  lowered 
Paco2 rather than to alkalosis per se. In chronic respiratory alkalo-
sis,  a  1-mmHg  decrease  in  Paco2  causes  a  0.4-to  0.5-mmol/L  drop 
−]  and  a  0.3-mmol/L  decrease  in  [H+]  (or  0.003  increase  
in  [HCO3
in pH).

The effects of respiratory alkalosis vary according to duration and 
severity  but  are  primarily  those  of  the  underlying  disease.  Reduced 
cerebral blood flow as a consequence of a rapid decline in Paco2 may 
cause  dizziness,  mental  confusion,  and  seizures,  even  in  the  absence 
of  hypoxemia.  The  cardiovascular  effects  of  acute  hypocapnia  in  the 
conscious  human  are  generally  minimal,  but  in  the  anesthetized  or 
mechanically  ventilated  patient,  cardiac  output  and  blood  pressure 
may fall because of the depressant effects of anesthesia and positive- 
pressure  ventilation  on  heart  rate,  systemic  resistance,  and  venous 
return. Cardiac arrhythmias may occur in patients with heart disease as 
a result of changes in oxygen unloading by blood from a left shift in the 
hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve (Bohr effect). Acute respiratory 
alkalosis causes intracellular shifts of Na+, K+, and PO4
2− and reduces 
free  [Ca2+]  by  increasing  the  protein-bound  fraction.  Hypocapnia- 
induced hypokalemia is usually minor.

Chronic respiratory alkalosis is the most common acid-base distur-
bance in critically ill patients and, when severe, portends a poor prog-
nosis. Many cardiopulmonary disorders manifest respiratory alkalosis 
in their early to intermediate stages, and the finding of normocapnia 
and  hypoxemia  in  a  patient  with  hyperventilation  may  herald  the 
onset of rapid respiratory failure and should prompt an assessment to 
determine if the patient is becoming fatigued. Respiratory alkalosis is 
common during mechanical ventilation.

The hyperventilation syndrome may be disabling. Paresthesia; cir-
cumoral numbness; chest wall tightness or pain; dizziness; inability to 
take an adequate breath; and, rarely, tetany may be sufficiently stressful 
to  perpetuate  the  disorder.  Arterial  blood-gas  analysis  demonstrates 
an  acute  or  chronic  respiratory  alkalosis,  often  with  hypocapnia  in 
the range of 15–30 mmHg and no hypoxemia. CNS diseases or injury 
can produce several patterns of hyperventilation and sustained Paco2 

levels  of  20–30  mmHg.  Hyperthyroidism,  high  caloric  loads,  and 
exercise raise the basal metabolic rate, but ventilation usually rises in 
proportion so that arterial blood gases are unchanged and respiratory 
alkalosis  does  not  develop.  Salicylates  are  the  most  common  cause 
of  drug-induced  respiratory  alkalosis  because  of  direct  stimulation 
of the medullary chemoreceptor (Chap. 458). In addition, the meth-
ylxanthines,  theophylline,  and  aminophylline  stimulate  ventilation 
and  increase  the  ventilatory  response  to  CO2.  Progesterone  increases 
ventilation  and  lowers  arterial  Paco2  by  as  much  as  5–10  mmHg. 
Therefore, chronic respiratory alkalosis is a common feature of preg-
nancy. Respiratory alkalosis is also prominent in liver failure, and the 
severity correlates with the degree of hepatic insufficiency. Respiratory 
alkalosis is often an early finding in gram-negative septicemia, before 
fever, hypoxemia, or hypotension develops.

The diagnosis of respiratory alkalosis depends on measurement of 
arterial pH and Paco2. The plasma [K+] is often reduced and the [Cl−] 
increased.  In  the  acute  phase,  respiratory  alkalosis  is  not  associated 
−  excretion,  but  within  hours,  net  acid 
with  increased  renal  HCO3
−  concentration  falls  by  
excretion  is  reduced.  In  general,  the  HCO3
2.0 mmol/L for each 10-mmHg decrease in Paco2. Chronic respiratory 
alkalosis  occurs  when  hypocapnia  persists  for  greater  than  3–5  days. 
−] by 4.0–5 mmol/L for 
The decline in Paco2 reduces the serum [HCO3
each  10-mmHg  decrease  in  Paco2.  It  is  unusual  to  observe  a  plasma 
−  <12  mmol/L  as  a  result  of  a  pure  respiratory  alkalosis.  The 
HCO3
–] is so effective in chronic 
compensatory reduction in plasma [HCO3
respiratory  alkalosis  that  the  pH  may  not  decline  significantly  from 
the normal value. Therefore, chronic respiratory alkalosis is the only 
acid-base disorder for which compensation can return the pH to the 
normal value.

When the diagnosis of respiratory alkalosis is made, its cause should 
be investigated. The diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome is made 
by exclusion. In difficult cases, it may be important to rule out other 
conditions such as pulmonary embolism, coronary artery disease, and 
hyperthyroidism.

TREATMENT
Respiratory Alkalosis

The management of respiratory alkalosis is directed toward allevia-
tion of the underlying disorder. If respiratory alkalosis complicates 
ventilator management, changes in dead space and tidal volume can 
minimize the hypocapnia. Patients with the hyperventilation syn-
drome may benefit from reassurance, rebreathing from a paper bag 
during  symptomatic  attacks,  and  attention  to  underlying  psycho-
logical stress. Antidepressants and sedatives are not recommended. 
β-Adrenergic blockers may ameliorate peripheral manifestations of 
the hyperadrenergic state.

56 Approach to the Patient 
with a Skin Disorder
Kim B. Yancey, Thomas J. Lawley

The  challenge  of  examining  the  skin  lies  in  distinguishing  normal 
from abnormal findings, distinguishing significant findings from trivial 
ones,  and  integrating  pertinent  signs  and  symptoms  into  an  appro-
priate  differential  diagnosis.  The  fact  that  the  largest  organ  in  the 
body  is  visible  is  both  an  advantage  and  a  disadvantage  to  those  who 
examine  it.  It  is  advantageous  because  no  special  instrumentation  is 
necessary  and  because  the  skin  can  be  biopsied  with  little  morbidity. 
However,  the  casual  observer  can  be  misled  by  a  variety  of  stimuli 
and  overlook  important,  subtle  signs  of  skin  or  systemic  disease.  For 
instance, the sometimes minor differences in color and shape that dis-
tinguish a melanoma (Fig. 56-1) from a benign nevomelanocytic nevus  
(Fig. 56-2) can be difficult to recognize. A variety of descriptive terms 
have  been  developed  that  characterize  cutaneous  lesions  (Tables  56-1, 
56-2, and 56-3; Fig. 56-3), thereby aiding in their interpretation and in 
the formulation of a differential diagnosis (Table 56-4). For example, the 
finding of scaling papules, which are present in psoriasis or atopic der-
matitis, places the patient in a different diagnostic category than would 
hemorrhagic papules, which may indicate vasculitis or sepsis (Figs. 56-4 
and 56-5, respectively). It is also important to differentiate primary from 
secondary skin lesions. If the examiner focuses on linear erosions over-
lying an area of erythema and scaling, he or she may incorrectly assume 
that the erosion is the primary lesion and that the redness and scale are 
secondary, whereas the correct interpretation would be that the patient 
has a pruritic eczematous dermatitis with erosions caused by scratching.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Skin Disorder

In examining the skin, it is usually advisable to assess the patient 
before taking an extensive history. This approach ensures that the 
entire  cutaneous  surface  will  be  evaluated,  and  objective  findings 
can be integrated with relevant historical data. Four basic features 
of a skin problem must be noted and considered during a physical 
examination: the distribution of the eruption, the types of primary 

FIGURE  56-1  Superficial  spreading  melanoma.  This  is  the  most  common  type  of 
melanoma.  Such  lesions  usually  demonstrate  asymmetry,  border  irregularity,  color 
variegation (black, blue, brown, pink, and white), a diameter >6 mm, and a history of 
change  (e.g.,  an  increase  in  size  or  development  of  associated  symptoms  such  as 
pruritus or pain).

FIGURE  56-2  Nevomelanocytic  nevus.  Nevi  are  benign  proliferations  of 
nevomelanocytes  characterized  by  regularly  shaped  hyperpigmented  macules  or 
papules of a uniform color. 

TABLE 56-1  Description of Primary Skin Lesions
Macule: A flat, colored lesion, <2 cm in diameter, not raised above the surface of 
the surrounding skin. A “freckle,” or ephelid, is a prototypical pigmented  
macule.
Patch: A large (>2 cm) flat lesion with a color different from the surrounding skin. 
This differs from a macule only in size.
Papule: A small, solid lesion, <0.5 cm in diameter, raised above the surface of the 
surrounding skin and thus palpable (e.g., a closed comedone, or whitehead, in 
acne).
Nodule: A larger (0.5–5.0 cm), firm lesion raised above the surface of the 
surrounding skin. This differs from a papule only in size (e.g., a large dermal 
nevomelanocytic nevus).
Tumor: A solid, raised growth >5 cm in diameter.
Plaque: A large (>1 cm), flat-topped, raised lesion; edges may either be distinct 
(e.g., in psoriasis) or gradually blend with surrounding skin (e.g., in eczematous 
dermatitis).
Vesicle: A small, fluid-filled lesion, <0.5 cm in diameter, raised above the  
plane of surrounding skin. Fluid is often visible, and the lesions are translucent 
(e.g., vesicles in allergic contact dermatitis caused by Toxicodendron  
[poison ivy]).
Pustule: A vesicle filled with leukocytes. Note: The presence of pustules does 
not necessarily signify the existence of an infection.
Bulla: A fluid-filled, raised, often translucent lesion >0.5 cm in diameter.
Wheal: A raised, erythematous, edematous papule or plaque, usually 
representing short-lived vasodilation and vasopermeability.
Telangiectasia: A dilated, superficial blood vessel.

TABLE 56-2  Description of Secondary Skin Lesions
Lichenification: A distinctive thickening of the skin that is characterized by 
accentuated skinfold markings.
Scale: Excessive accumulation of stratum corneum.
Crust: Dried exudate of body fluids that may be either yellow (i.e., serous crust) 
or red (i.e., hemorrhagic crust).
Erosion: Loss of epidermis without an associated loss of dermis.
Ulcer: Loss of epidermis and at least a portion of the underlying dermis.
Excoriation: Linear, angular erosions that may be covered by crust and are 
caused by scratching.
Atrophy: An acquired loss of substance. In the skin, this may appear as a 
depression with intact epidermis (i.e., loss of dermal or subcutaneous tissue) or 
as sites of shiny, delicate, wrinkled lesions (i.e., epidermal atrophy).
Scar: A change in the skin secondary to trauma or inflammation. Sites may be 
erythematous, hypopigmented, or hyperpigmented depending on their age or 
character. Sites on hair-bearing areas may be characterized by destruction of 
hair follicles.

TABLE 56-3  Common Dermatologic Terms
Alopecia: Hair loss, partial or complete.
Annular: Ring-shaped.
Cyst: A soft, raised, encapsulated lesion filled with semisolid or liquid contents.
Herpetiform: In a grouped configuration.
Lichenoid eruption: Violaceous to purple, polygonal lesions that resemble those 
seen in lichen planus.
Milia: Small, firm, white papules filled with keratin.
Morbilliform rash: Generalized, small erythematous macules and/or papules that 
resemble lesions seen in measles.
Nummular: Coin-shaped.
Poikiloderma: Skin that displays variegated pigmentation, atrophy, and 
telangiectasias.
Polycyclic lesions: A configuration of skin lesions formed from coalescing rings 
or incomplete rings.
Pruritus: A sensation that elicits the desire to scratch. Pruritus is often the 
predominant symptom of inflammatory skin diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis, 
allergic contact dermatitis); it is also commonly associated with xerosis and 
aged skin. Systemic conditions that can be associated with pruritus include 
chronic renal disease, cholestasis, pregnancy, malignancy, thyroid disease, 
polycythemia vera, and delusions of parasitosis.

and  secondary  lesions,  the  shape  of  individual  lesions,  and  the 
arrangement of the lesions. An ideal skin examination includes eval-
uation of the skin, hair, and nails as well as the mucous membranes 
of  the  mouth,  eyes,  nose,  nasopharynx,  and  anogenital  region.  In 
the initial examination, it is important that the patient be disrobed 
as completely as possible to minimize chances of missing important 
individual skin lesions and permit accurate assessment of the dis-
tribution of the eruption. The patient should first be viewed from a 
distance of about 1.5–2 m (4–6 ft) so that the general character of 
the  skin  and  the  distribution  of  lesions  can  be  evaluated.  Indeed, 
the  distribution  of  lesions  often  correlates  highly  with  diagnosis 
(Fig. 56-6). For example, a hospitalized patient with a generalized 
erythematous exanthem is more likely to have a drug eruption than 
is a patient with a similar rash limited to the sun-exposed portions 
of the face. Once the distribution of the lesions has been established, 
the nature of the primary lesion must be determined. Thus, when 
lesions are distributed on elbows, knees, and scalp, the most likely 
possibility  based  solely  on  distribution  is  psoriasis  or  dermatitis 
herpetiformis  (Figs.  56-7  and  56-8,  respectively).  The  primary 
lesion in psoriasis is a scaly papule that soon forms erythematous 
plaques covered with a white scale, whereas that of dermatitis her-
petiformis is an urticarial papule that quickly becomes a small ves-
icle. In this manner, identification of the primary lesion directs the 
examiner toward the proper diagnosis. Secondary changes in skin 
can  also  be  quite  helpful.  For  example,  scale  represents  excessive 
epidermis, while crust is the result of a discontinuous epithelial cell 
layer. Palpation of skin lesions can yield insight into the character of 
an eruption. Thus, red papules on the lower extremities that blanch

with pressure can be a manifestation of many different diseases, but 
hemorrhagic red papules that do not blanch with pressure indicate 
palpable purpura characteristic of necrotizing vasculitis (Fig. 56-4).
The  shape  of  lesions  is  also  an  important  feature.  Flat,  round, 
erythematous  papules  and  plaques  are  common  in  many  cutane-
ous  diseases.  However,  target-shaped  lesions  that  consist  in  part 
of  erythematous  plaques  are  specific  for  erythema  multiforme   
(Fig.  56-9).  Likewise,  the  arrangement  of  individual  lesions  is 
important. Erythematous papules and vesicles can occur in many 
conditions, but their arrangement in a specific linear array suggests 
an external etiology such as allergic contact dermatitis (Fig. 56-10) 
or primary irritant dermatitis. In contrast, lesions with a general-
ized arrangement are common and suggest a systemic etiology.

As in other branches of medicine, a complete history should be 

obtained to emphasize the following features:

1.  Evolution of lesions
a.  Site of onset
b.  Manner in which the eruption progressed or spread
c.  Duration
d.  Periods of resolution or improvement in chronic eruptions

 ■ DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES
Many  skin  diseases  can  be  diagnosed  on  the  basis  of  gross  clinical 
appearance, but sometimes relatively simple diagnostic procedures can 
yield valuable information. In most instances, they can be performed 
at the bedside with a minimum of equipment.

Skin Biopsy  A skin biopsy is a straightforward minor surgical pro-
cedure; however, it is important to biopsy a lesion that is most likely to 
yield diagnostic findings. This decision may require expertise in skin 
diseases and knowledge of superficial anatomic structures in selected 
areas of the body. In this procedure, a small area of skin is anesthetized 
with  1%  lidocaine  with  or  without  epinephrine.  The  skin  lesion  in 

question  can  be  excised  or  saucerized  with  a  scalpel  or  removed  by 
punch  biopsy.  In  the  latter  technique,  a  punch  is  pressed  against  the 
surface of the skin and rotated with downward pressure until it pene-
trates to the subcutaneous tissue. The circular biopsy is then lifted with 
forceps,  and  the  bottom  is  cut  with  iris  scissors.  Biopsy  sites  may  or 
may not need suture closure, depending on size and location.

KOH Preparation  A  potassium  hydroxide  (KOH)  preparation  is 
performed on scaling skin lesions where a fungal infection is suspected. 
The edge of such a lesion is scraped gently with a no. 15 scalpel blade. 
The removed scale is collected on a glass microscope slide, treated with 
1 or 2 drops of a solution of 10–20% KOH, and placement of a cover

small and large erythematous papules and plaques with overlying adherent silvery 
scale. 

FIGURE  56-8  Dermatitis  herpetiformis.  This  disorder  typically  displays  pruritic, 
grouped papulovesicles on elbows, knees, buttocks, and posterior scalp. Vesicles 
are often excoriated due to associated pruritus.

FIGURE  56-9  Erythema  multiforme.  This  eruption  is  characterized  by  multiple 
erythematous  plaques  with  a  target  or  iris  morphology.  It  usually  represents  a 
hypersensitivity  reaction  to  drugs  (e.g.,  sulfonamides)  or  infections  (e.g.,  HSV).

slip.  KOH  dissolves  keratin  and  allows  easier  visualization  of  fungal 
elements.  Brief  heating  of  the  slide  accelerates  dissolution  of  keratin. 
When the preparation is viewed under the microscope, the refractile 
hyphae are seen more easily when the light intensity is reduced and the 
condenser is lowered. This technique can be used to identify hyphae 
in  dermatophyte  infections,  pseudohyphae  and  budding  yeasts  in 
Candida infections, and “spaghetti and meatballs” yeast forms in tinea 
versicolor. The same sampling technique can be used to obtain scale for 
culture of selected pathogenic organisms.

Tzanck Smear  A Tzanck smear is a cytologic technique most often 
used in the diagnosis of herpesvirus infections (herpes simplex virus 
[HSV]  or  varicella-zoster  virus  [VZV])  (see  Figs.  193-1  and  193-3). 
An early vesicle, not a pustule or crusted lesion, is unroofed, and the 
base of the lesion is scraped gently with a scalpel blade. The material is 

placed on a glass slide, air-dried, and stained with Giemsa or Wright’s 
stain. Multinucleated epithelial giant cells suggest the presence of HSV 
or  VZV;  culture,  immunofluorescence  microscopy,  or  genetic  testing 
must be performed to identify the specific virus.
Diascopy  Diascopy is designed to assess whether a skin lesion will 
blanch  with  pressure  as,  for  example,  in  determining  whether  a  red 
lesion is hemorrhagic or simply blood-filled. Urticaria (Fig. 56-11) will 
blanch with pressure, whereas a purpuric lesion caused by necrotizing 
vasculitis  (Fig.  56-4)  will  not.  Diascopy  is  performed  by  pressing  a 
microscope  slide  or  magnifying  lens  against  a  lesion  and  noting  the 
amount of blanching that occurs. Granulomas often have an opaque to 
transparent, brown-pink “apple jelly” appearance on diascopy.

Dermoscopy  Dermoscopy is a noninvasive method of examining 
the  skin  surface  that  uses  a  high-quality  magnifying  lens  and  a  spe-
cialized light source (i.e., a dermatoscope). Dermoscopy identifies skin 
structures, colors, and patterns that are not visible to the naked eye. It is 
particularly useful in the evaluation of pigmented skin lesions.

Wood’s  Light  A  Wood’s  lamp  generates  360-nm  ultraviolet 
(“black”)  light  that  can  be  used  to  aid  the  evaluation  of  certain  skin 
disorders. For example, a Wood’s lamp will cause erythrasma (a super-
ficial,  intertriginous  infection  caused  by  Corynebacterium  minutissi-
mum) to show a characteristic coral pink color, and wounds colonized 
by Pseudomonas will appear pale blue. Tinea capitis caused by certain 
dermatophytes  (e.g.,  Microsporum  canis  or  M.  audouinii)  exhibits  a 
yellow fluorescence. Pigmented lesions of the epidermis such as freck-
les  are  accentuated,  while  dermal  pigment  such  as  postinflammatory 
hyperpigmentation  fades  under  a  Wood’s  light.  Vitiligo  (Fig.  56-12)

appears totally white under a Wood’s lamp, and previously unsuspected 
areas of involvement often become apparent. A Wood’s lamp may also 
aid in the demonstration of tinea versicolor, detection of sites of depig-
mentation within and/or surrounding melanomas, and recognition of 
ash leaf spots in patients with tuberous sclerosis.

Patch Tests  Patch testing is designed to document sensitivity to a 
specific antigen. In this procedure, a battery of suspected allergens is 
applied to the patient’s back under occlusive dressings and allowed to 
remain in contact with the skin for 48 h. The dressings are removed, 
and  the  area  is  examined  for  evidence  of  delayed  hypersensitivity 
reactions  (e.g.,  erythema,  edema,  or  papulovesicles).  This  test  is  best 
performed  by  physicians  with  special  expertise  in  patch  testing  and 
is often helpful in the evaluation of patients with chronic dermatitis.

Skin Disorders

ECZEMA AND DERMATITIS
Eczema is a type of dermatitis, and these terms are often used synon-
ymously (e.g., atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis [AD]). Eczema is a 
reaction  pattern  that  presents  with  variable  clinical  findings  and  the 
common  histologic  finding  of  spongiosis  (intercellular  edema  of  the 
epidermis).  Eczema  is  the  final  common  expression  for  a  number  of 
disorders, including those discussed in the following sections. Primary 
lesions  may  include  erythematous  macules,  papules,  and  vesicles, 
which  can  coalesce  to  form  patches  and  plaques.  In  severe  eczema, 
secondary  lesions  from  infection  or  excoriation,  marked  by  weeping 
and  crusting,  may  predominate.  In  chronic  eczematous  conditions, 
lichenification  (cutaneous  hypertrophy  and  accentuation  of  normal 
skin markings) may alter the characteristic appearance of eczema.

 ■ ATOPIC DERMATITIS
AD  is  the  cutaneous  expression  of  the  atopic  state,  characterized  by  a 
family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema. The prevalence of 
AD is increasing worldwide. Some of its features are shown in Table 57-1.
The etiology of AD is only partially defined, but there is a clear 
genetic  predisposition.  When  both  parents  are  affected  by  AD, 
>80% of their children manifest the disease. When only one par-
ent is affected, the prevalence drops to slightly >50%. A characteristic 
defect  in  AD  that  contributes  to  the  pathophysiology  is  an  impaired 
epidermal barrier. In many patients, a mutation in the gene encoding 
filaggrin, a structural protein in the stratum corneum, is responsible. 
Patients  with  AD  may  display  a  variety  of  immunoregulatory  abnor-
malities, including increased IgE synthesis; increased serum IgE levels; 
and impaired, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.

6.  Lichenification of skin
7.  Presence of dry skin

The clinical presentation often varies with age. Half of patients with 
AD present within the first year of life, and 80% present by 5 years of 
age.  About  80%  ultimately  coexpress  allergic  rhinitis  or  asthma.  The 
infantile  pattern  is  characterized  by  weeping  inflammatory  patches 
and  crusted  plaques  on  the  face,  neck,  and  extensor  surfaces.  The 
childhood and adolescent patterns are typified by dermatitis of flexural 
skin, particularly in the antecubital and popliteal fossae (Fig. 57-1). AD 
may  resolve  spontaneously,  but  approximately  40%  of  all  individuals 
affected as children will have dermatitis in adult life. The distribution 
of lesions in adults may be similar to those seen in childhood; however, 
adults frequently have localized disease manifesting as lichen simplex 
chronicus  or  hand  eczema  (see  below).  In  patients  with  localized 
disease, AD may be suspected because of a typical personal or family 
history or the presence of cutaneous stigmata of AD such as perioral 
pallor, an extra fold of skin beneath the lower eyelid (Dennie-Morgan 
folds), increased palmar skin markings, and an increased incidence of 
cutaneous infections, particularly with Staphylococcus aureus. Regard-
less  of  other  manifestations,  pruritus  is  a  prominent  characteristic 
of AD in all age groups and is exacerbated by dry skin. Many of the 
cutaneous  findings  in  affected  patients,  such  as  lichenification,  are 
secondary to rubbing and scratching.

TREATMENT
Atopic Dermatitis

Therapy  for  AD  should  include  avoidance  of  cutaneous  irritants, 
adequate  moisturization  through  the  application  of  emollients, 
judicious  use  of  topical  anti-inflammatory  agents,  and  prompt 
treatment of secondary infection. Patients should be instructed to 
bathe no more often than daily, using warm or cool water, and to 
use only mild bath soap. Immediately after bathing, while the skin 
is still moist, a topical anti-inflammatory agent in a cream or oint-
ment  base  should  be  applied  to  areas  of  dermatitis,  and  all  other 
skin areas should be lubricated with a moisturizer. Approximately 
30 g of a topical agent is required to cover the entire body surface 
of an average adult.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesLow-  to  mid-potency  topical  glucocorticoids  are  employed  in 
most  treatment  regimens  for  AD.  Skin  atrophy  and  the  potential 
for systemic absorption are constant concerns, especially with more 
potent  agents.  Low-potency  topical  glucocorticoids  or  nongluco-
corticoid anti-inflammatory agents should be selected for use on the 
face and in intertriginous areas to minimize the risk of skin atrophy. 
Three nonglucocorticoid anti-inflammatory agents approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available for topical 
use in AD: tacrolimus ointment, pimecrolimus cream, and crisabo-
role ointment. These agents do not cause skin atrophy, nor do they 
suppress  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis.  The  first  two 
agents are topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), whereas crisaborole 
is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. Concerns regarding the poten-
tial for lymphomas in patients treated with TCIs have largely been 
unfounded. Currently, all three agents are more costly than topical 
glucocorticoids. Barrier-repair products that attempt to restore the 
impaired epidermal barrier are also nonglucocorticoid agents and 
are gaining popularity in the treatment of AD.

Secondary infection of eczematous skin may lead to exacerbation 
of AD. Crusted and weeping skin lesions may be infected with S. 
aureus. When secondary infection is suspected, eczematous lesions 
should  be  cultured  and  patients  treated  with  systemic  antibiotics 
active  against  S.  aureus.  The  initial  use  of  penicillinase-resistant 
penicillins  or  cephalosporins  is  preferable.  Dicloxacillin  or  ceph-
alexin (250 mg qid for 7–10 days) is generally adequate for adults; 
however,  antibiotic  selection  must  be  directed  by  culture  results 
and  clinical  response.  More  than  50%  of  S.  aureus  isolates  are 
now  methicillin  resistant  in  some  communities.  Current  recom-
mendations for the treatment of infection with these community- 
acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains in adults 
include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (one double-strength tab-
let  bid),  minocycline  (100  mg  bid),  doxycycline  (100  mg  bid),  or 
clindamycin  (300–450  mg  qid).  Duration  of  therapy  should  be   
7–10 days. Inducible resistance may limit clindamycin’s usefulness. 
Such  resistance  can  be  detected  by  the  double-disk  diffusion  test, 
which should be ordered if the isolate is erythromycin resistant and 
clindamycin sensitive. As an adjunct, antibacterial washes or dilute 
sodium hypochlorite baths (0.005% bleach) and intermittent nasal 
mupirocin may be useful.

Control of pruritus is essential for treatment, as AD often rep-
resents “an itch that rashes.” Antihistamines are most often used to 
control pruritus. Diphenhydramine (25 mg every 4–6 h), hydroxyz-
ine (10–25 mg every 6 h), and doxepin (10–25 mg at bedtime) are 
useful primarily due to their sedating action. Higher doses of these 
agents  may  be  required,  but  sedation  can  become  bothersome. 
Patients  need  to  be  counseled  about  driving  or  operating  heavy 
equipment after taking these medications. When used at bedtime, 
sedating antihistamines may improve the patient’s sleep. Although 
they are effective in urticaria, nonsedating antihistamines and selec-
tive H2 blockers are of little use in controlling the pruritus of AD.

Treatment  with  systemic  glucocorticoids  should  be  limited  to 
severe exacerbations unresponsive to topical therapy. In the patient 
with chronic AD, therapy with systemic glucocorticoids will gener-
ally clear the skin only briefly, and cessation of the systemic therapy 
will invariably be accompanied by a return, if not a worsening, of the 
dermatitis. For chronic severe AD poorly responsive to standard top-
ical  regimens,  systemic  agents  may  be  considered.  Cyclosporine  is 
approved for treatment of severe recalcitrant AD in some European 
countries.  Monitoring  of  renal  function  and  secondary  infections 
is required. Dupilumab, an interleukin 4 receptor blocker, is FDA 
approved for use in patients 6 years of age and older and provides 
more targeted immunomodulation and a better safety profile than 
cyclosporine.  Patients  who  do  not  respond  to  conventional  ther-
apies  should  be  considered  for  patch  testing  to  rule  out  allergic 
contact  dermatitis  (ACD).  The  role  of  dietary  allergens  in  AD  is 
controversial,  and  there  is  little  evidence  that  they  play  any  role 
outside of infancy, during which a small percentage of patients with 
AD may be affected by food allergens.

 ■ LICHEN SIMPLEX CHRONICUS
Lichen  simplex  chronicus  may  represent  the  end  stage  of  a  variety 
of  pruritic  and  eczematous  disorders,  including  AD.  It  consists  of  a 
circumscribed  plaque  or  plaques  of  lichenified  skin  due  to  chronic 
scratching or rubbing. Common areas involved include the posterior 
nuchal  region,  dorsum  of  the  feet,  and  ankles.  Treatment  of  lichen 
simplex chronicus centers on breaking the cycle of chronic itching and 
scratching.  High-potency  topical  glucocorticoids  are  helpful  in  most 
cases, but, in recalcitrant cases, application of topical glucocorticoids 
under  occlusion  or  intralesional  injection  of  glucocorticoids  may  be 
required.

 ■ CONTACT DERMATITIS
Contact  dermatitis  is  an  inflammatory  skin  process  caused  by  an 
exogenous agent or agents that directly or indirectly injure the skin. In 
irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), this injury is caused by an inherent 
characteristic  of  a  compound—for  example,  a  concentrated  acid  or 
base.  Agents  that  cause  allergic  contact  dermatitis  (ACD)  induce  an 
antigen-specific  immune  response  (e.g.,  poison  ivy  dermatitis).  The 
clinical lesions of contact dermatitis may be acute (wet and edematous) 
or chronic (dry, thickened, and scaly), depending on the persistence of 
the insult (see Chap. 56, Fig. 56-10).

Irritant  Contact  Dermatitis 
ICD  is  generally  well  demarcated 
and often localized to areas of thin skin (eyelids, intertriginous areas) 
or  areas  where  the  irritant  was  occluded.  Lesions  may  range  from 
minimal skin erythema to areas of marked edema, vesicles, and ulcers. 
Prior exposure to the offending agent is not necessary, and the reaction 
develops  in  minutes  to  a  few  hours.  Chronic  low-grade  irritant  der-
matitis is the most common type of ICD, and the most common area 
of involvement is the hands (see below). The most common irritants 
encountered  are  chronic  wet  work,  soaps,  and  detergents.  Treatment 
should  be  directed  toward  the  avoidance  of  irritants  and  the  use  of 
protective gloves or clothing.

Allergic Contact Dermatitis  ACD is a manifestation of delayed-
type hypersensitivity mediated by memory T lymphocytes in the skin. 
Prior  exposure  to  the  offending  agent  is  necessary  to  develop  the 
hypersensitivity  reaction,  which  may  take  as  little  as  12  h  or  as  long 
as  72  h  to  develop.  The  most  common  cause  of  ACD  is  exposure  to 
plants, especially to members of the family Anacardiaceae, including 
the  genus  Toxicodendron.  Poison  ivy,  poison  oak,  and  poison  sumac 
are  members  of  this  genus  and  cause  an  allergic  reaction  marked  by 
erythema,  vesiculation,  and  severe  pruritus.  The  eruption  is  often 
linear  or  angular,  corresponding  to  areas  where  plants  have  touched 
the skin. The sensitizing antigen common to these plants is urushiol, 
an oleoresin containing the active ingredient pentadecylcatechol. The 
oleoresin may adhere to skin, clothing, tools, and pets, and contami-
nated articles may cause dermatitis even after prolonged storage. Blister 
fluid  does  not  contain  urushiol  and  is  not  capable  of  inducing  skin 
eruption in exposed subjects.

TREATMENT
Contact Dermatitis

If contact dermatitis is suspected and an offending agent is identi-
fied and removed, the eruption will resolve. Usually, treatment with 
high-potency topical glucocorticoids is enough to relieve symptoms 
while the dermatitis runs its course. For patients who require sys-
temic  therapy,  daily  oral  prednisone—beginning  at  1  mg/kg,  but 
usually ≤60 mg/d—is sufficient. The dose should be tapered over 
2–3  weeks,  and  each  daily  dose  should  be  taken  in  the  morning 
with food.

Identification of a contact allergen can be a difficult and time-
consuming  task.  ACD  should  be  suspected  in  patients  with  der-
matitis  unresponsive  to  conventional  therapy  or  with  an  unusual 
and  patterned  distribution.  Patients  should  be  questioned  care-
fully  regarding  occupational  exposures  and  topical  medications. 
Common sensitizers include preservatives in topical preparations,

 ■ NUMMULAR ECZEMA
Nummular  eczema  is  characterized  by  circular  or  oval  “coinlike” 
lesions, beginning as small edematous papules that become crusted and 
scaly. The etiology of nummular eczema is unknown, but dry skin is 
a contributing factor. Common locations are the trunk or the extensor 
surfaces of the extremities, particularly on the pretibial areas or dorsum 
of the hands. Nummular eczema occurs more frequently in men and 
is most common in middle age. The treatment of nummular eczema is 
similar to that for AD.
 ■ ASTEATOTIC ECZEMA
Asteatotic eczema, also known as xerotic eczema or “winter itch,” is a 
mildly inflammatory dermatitis that develops in areas of extremely dry 
skin,  especially  during  the  dry  winter  months.  Clinically,  there  may 
be considerable overlap with nummular eczema. This form of eczema 
accounts for many physician visits because of the associated pruritus. 
Fine  cracks  and  scale,  with  or  without  erythema,  characteristically 
develop in areas of dry skin, especially on the anterior surfaces of the 
lower extremities in elderly patients. Asteatotic eczema responds well 
to topical moisturizers and the avoidance of cutaneous irritants. Over-
bathing and the use of harsh soaps exacerbate asteatotic eczema.
 ■ STASIS DERMATITIS AND STASIS ULCERATION
Stasis  dermatitis  develops  on  the  lower  extremities  secondary  to 
venous incompetence and chronic edema. Patients may give a history 
of  deep  venous  thrombosis  and  may  have  evidence  of  vein  removal 
or  varicose  veins.  Early  findings  in  stasis  dermatitis  consist  of  mild 
erythema and scaling associated with pruritus. The typical initial site 
of involvement is the medial aspect of the ankle, often over a distended 
vein (Fig. 57-3).

Stasis  dermatitis  may  become  acutely  inflamed,  with  crusting  and 
exudate.  In  this  state,  it  is  easily  confused  with  cellulitis.  Of  note, 
symmetrical  and  bilateral  involvement  is  more  likely  stasis  dermatitis, 
whereas unilateral involvement may represent cellulitis. Chronic stasis 
dermatitis  is  often  associated  with  dermal  fibrosis  that  is  recognized 
clinically as brawny edema of the skin. As the disorder progresses, the 
dermatitis becomes progressively pigmented due to chronic erythrocyte 
extravasation leading to cutaneous hemosiderin deposition. Stasis der-
matitis may be complicated by secondary infection and contact dermati-
tis. Severe stasis dermatitis may precede the development of stasis ulcers.

TREATMENT
Stasis Dermatitis and Stasis Ulceration

Patients with stasis dermatitis and stasis ulceration benefit greatly 
from  leg  elevation  and  the  routine  use  of  compression  stockings 
with a gradient of at least 30–40 mmHg. Stockings providing less

are also seen in this patient.

nickel sulfate, potassium dichromate, thimerosal, neomycin sulfate, 
fragrances, formaldehyde, and rubber-curing agents. Patch testing 
is helpful in identifying these agents but should not be attempted 
when patients have widespread active dermatitis or are taking sys-
temic glucocorticoids.

 ■ HAND ECZEMA
Hand eczema is a very common, chronic skin disorder in which both 
exogenous  and  endogenous  factors  play  important  roles.  It  may  be 
associated  with  other  cutaneous  disorders  such  as  AD,  and  contact 
with various agents may be involved. Hand eczema represents a large 
proportion  of  cases  of  occupation-associated  skin  disease.  Chronic, 
excessive exposure to water and detergents, harsh chemicals, or aller-
gens may initiate or aggravate this disorder. It may present with dryness 
and cracking of the skin of the hands as well as with variable amounts 
of erythema and edema. Often, the dermatitis will begin under rings, 
where water and irritants are trapped. Dyshidrotic eczema, a variant of 
hand eczema, presents with multiple, intensely pruritic, small papules 
and vesicles on the thenar and hypothenar eminences and the sides of 
the fingers (Fig. 57-2). Lesions tend to occur in crops that slowly form 
crusts and then heal.

The  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  hand  eczema  should  include  an 
assessment of potential occupation-associated exposures. The history 
should be directed to identifying possible irritant or allergen exposures.

TREATMENT
Hand Eczema

Therapy for hand eczema is directed toward avoidance of irritants, 
identification of possible contact allergens, treatment of coexistent 
infection, and application of topical glucocorticoids. Whenever pos-
sible, the hands should be protected by gloves, preferably vinyl. The 
use of rubber gloves (latex) to protect dermatitic skin is sometimes 
associated  with  the  development  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  to 
components of the gloves, which could be either a type I hypersensi-
tivity reaction to the latex (manifested by the development of hives, 
itching,  angioedema,  and  possibly  anaphylaxis  within  minutes  to 
hours of exposure) or a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to rubber 
accelerators  (with  worsening  of  eczematous  eruptions  days  after 
exposure). Patients can be treated with cool moist compresses fol-
lowed by application of a mid- to high-potency topical glucocorti-
coid in a cream or ointment base. As in AD, treatment of secondary 
infection  is  essential  for  good  control.  In  addition,  patients  with 
hand  eczema  should  be  examined  for  dermatophyte  infection  by 
potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and culture (see below).

postauricular  areas  often  become  macerated  and  tender.  Seborrheic 
dermatitis may also develop in the central chest, axilla, groin, submam-
mary folds, and gluteal cleft. Rarely, it may cause widespread general-
ized dermatitis. Pruritus is variable.

Seborrheic dermatitis may be evident within the first few weeks of 
life,  and  within  this  context,  it  typically  occurs  in  the  scalp  (“cradle 
cap”),  face,  or  groin.  It  is  rarely  seen  in  children  beyond  infancy  but 
becomes evident again during adolescent and adult life. Although it is 
frequently seen in patients with Parkinson’s disease, in those who have 
had  cerebrovascular  accidents,  and  in  those  with  HIV  infection,  the 
overwhelming majority of individuals with seborrheic dermatitis have 
no underlying disorder.

TREATMENT
Seborrheic Dermatitis

Treatment  with  low-potency  topical  glucocorticoids  in  conjunc-
tion  with  a  topical  antifungal  agent,  such  as  ketoconazole  cream 
or  ciclopirox  cream,  is  often  effective.  The  scalp  and  beard  areas 
may benefit from antidandruff shampoos, which should be left in 
place 3–5 min before rinsing. High-potency topical glucocorticoid 
solutions (betamethasone or clobetasol) are effective for control of 
severe scalp involvement. High-potency glucocorticoids should not 
be used on the face because this treatment is often associated with 
steroid-induced rosacea or atrophy.

PAPULOSQUAMOUS DISORDERS  
(TABLE 57-2)
 ■ PSORIASIS
Psoriasis is one of the most common dermatologic diseases, affecting up 
to 2% of the world’s population. It is an immune-mediated disease clin-
ically characterized by erythematous, sharply demarcated papules and 
rounded plaques covered by silvery micaceous scale. The skin lesions of 
psoriasis are variably pruritic. Traumatized areas often develop lesions 
of  psoriasis  (the  Koebner  or  isomorphic  phenomenon).  In  addition, 
other  external  factors  may  exacerbate  psoriasis,  including  infections, 
stress, and medications (lithium, beta blockers, and antimalarial drugs).
The most common variety of psoriasis is called plaque-type. Patients 
with  plaque-type  psoriasis  have  stable,  slowly  enlarging  plaques, 
which remain basically unchanged for long periods of time. The most 
commonly  involved  areas  are  the  elbows,  knees,  gluteal  cleft,  and 
scalp.  Involvement  tends  to  be  symmetric.  Plaque  psoriasis  generally 
develops slowly and runs an indolent course. It rarely remits spontane-
ously. Inverse psoriasis affects the intertriginous regions, including the 
axilla, groin, submammary region, and navel; it also tends to affect the 
scalp, palms, and soles. The individual lesions are sharply demarcated 
plaques (see Chap. 56, Fig. 56-7), but they may be moist and without 
scale due to their locations.

compression,  such  as  antiembolism  hose,  are  poor  substitutes. 
Use of emollients and/or mid-potency topical glucocorticoids and 
avoidance of irritants are also helpful in treating stasis dermatitis. 
Protection of the legs from injury, including scratching, and control 
of chronic edema are essential to prevent ulcers. Diuretics may be 
required to adequately control chronic edema.

Stasis  ulcers  are  difficult  to  treat,  and  resolution  is  slow.  It  is 
extremely  important  to  elevate  the  affected  limb  as  much  as  pos-
sible. The ulcer should be kept clear of necrotic material by gentle 
debridement  and  covered  with  a  semipermeable  dressing  and  a 
compression  dressing  or  compression  stocking.  Glucocorticoids 
should not be applied to ulcers, because they may retard healing; 
however,  they  may  be  applied  to  the  surrounding  skin  to  control 
itching,  scratching,  and  additional  trauma.  Superficial  bacterial 
cultures of chronic stasis ulcers often yield polymicrobial coloniz-
ers and are of little utility in determination of secondary infection. 
Care must be taken to exclude treatable causes of leg ulcers (hyper-
coagulation, vasculitis, arterial insufficiency) before beginning the 
chronic management outlined above.

 ■ SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS
Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, chronic disorder characterized by 
greasy  scales  overlying  erythematous  patches  or  plaques.  Induration 
and  scale  are  generally  less  prominent  than  in  psoriasis,  but  clinical 
overlap  exists  between  these  diseases  (“sebopsoriasis”).  The  most 
common location is in the scalp, where it may be recognized as severe 
dandruff. On the face, seborrheic dermatitis affects the eyebrows, eye-
lids, glabella, and nasolabial folds (Fig. 57-4). Scaling of the external

Guttate  psoriasis  (eruptive  psoriasis)  is  most  common  in  children 
and young adults. It develops acutely in individuals without psoriasis 
or in those with chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients present with many 
small erythematous, scaling papules, frequently after upper respiratory 
tract infection with β-hemolytic streptococci. The differential diagno-
sis should include pityriasis rosea and secondary syphilis.

In  pustular  psoriasis,  patients  may  have  disease  localized  to  the 
palms and soles, or the disease may be generalized. Regardless of the 
extent  of  disease,  the  skin  is  erythematous,  with  pustules  and  vari-
able scale. Localized to the palms and soles, it is easily confused with 
dishydrotic eczema. When it is generalized, episodes are characterized 
by fever (39°–40°C [102.2°–104.0°F]) lasting several days, an accom-
panying generalized eruption of sterile pustules, and a background of 
intense  erythema;  patients  may  become  erythrodermic.  Episodes  of 
fever  and  pustules  are  recurrent.  Local  irritants,  pregnancy,  medica-
tions, infections, and systemic glucocorticoid withdrawal can precipi-
tate this form of psoriasis. Oral retinoids are the treatment of choice in 
nonpregnant patients.

Fingernail involvement, appearing as punctate pitting, onycholysis, 
nail thickening, or subungual hyperkeratosis, may be a clue to the diag-
nosis of psoriasis when the clinical presentation is not classic.

According  to  the  National  Psoriasis  Foundation,  up  to  30%  of 
patients with psoriasis have psoriatic arthritis (PsA). It develops most 
commonly between the ages of 30 and 50 years. There are five subtypes 
of PsA: symmetric PsA, asymmetric PsA, distal PsA, spondylitis, and 
arthritis mutilans. Approximately 50% of PsA is classified as symmet-
ric,  which  may  resemble  rheumatoid  arthritis.  Asymmetric  arthritis 
comprises about 35% of cases. It can involve any joint and may present 
as  “sausage  digits.”  Distal  PsA  is  the  classic  form;  however,  it  occurs 
in only about 5% of patients with PsA. It can involve fingers and toes; 
fingernails  and  toenails  are  often  dystrophic,  including  nail  pitting. 
Spondylitis also occurs in ~5% of patients with PsA. Arthritis mutilans 
is  severe  and  deforming  and  affects  primarily  the  small  joints  of  the 
hands and feet. It accounts for fewer than 5% of PsA cases.

An  increased  risk  of  metabolic  syndrome,  including  increased 
morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular events, has been demon-
strated  in  psoriasis  patients.  Appropriate  screening  tests  should  be 
performed.  The  etiology  of  psoriasis  is  still  poorly  understood,  but 
there is clearly a genetic component to the disease. In various studies, 
30–50%  of  patients  with  psoriasis  report  a  positive  family  history. 
Psoriatic lesions contain infiltrates of activated T cells that are thought 
to elaborate cytokines responsible for keratinocyte hyperproliferation, 
which results in the characteristic clinical findings. Agents inhibiting  
T-cell activation, clonal expansion, or release of proinflammatory cytok-
ines are often effective for the treatment of severe psoriasis (see below).

TREATMENT
Psoriasis

with mid-potency topical glucocorticoids, although their long-term 
use  is  often  accompanied  by  loss  of  effectiveness  (tachyphylaxis) 
and  atrophy  of  the  skin.  A  topical  vitamin  D  analogue  (calcipo-
triene) and a retinoid (tazarotene) are also efficacious in the treat-
ment  of  limited  psoriasis  and  have  largely  replaced  other  topical 
agents such as coal tar, salicylic acid, and anthralin.

Ultraviolet (UV) light, natural or artificial, is an effective therapy 
for many patients with widespread psoriasis. Ultraviolet B (UVB), 
narrowband UVB, and ultraviolet A (UVA) light with either oral or 
topical  psoralens  (PUVA)  are  used  clinically.  UV  light’s  immuno-
suppressive properties are thought to be responsible for its thera-
peutic activity in psoriasis. It is also mutagenic, potentially leading 
to  an  increased  incidence  of  nonmelanoma  and  melanoma  skin 
cancer.  UV-light  therapy  is  contraindicated  in  patients  receiving 
cyclosporine and should be used with great care in all immunocom-
promised patients due to the increased risk of skin cancer.

Various systemic agents can be used for severe, widespread pso-
riatic disease (Table 57-3). Oral glucocorticoids should not be used 
for the treatment of psoriasis due to the potential for development 
of life-threatening pustular psoriasis when therapy is discontinued. 
Methotrexate is an effective agent, especially in patients with PsA. 
The synthetic retinoid acitretin is useful, especially when immuno-
suppression must be avoided; however, teratogenicity limits its use. 
Apremilast  inhibits  phosphodiesterase  type  4.  It  is  approved  for 
both psoriasis and PsA. It must be used cautiously in the presence 
of renal failure or depression.

The evidence implicating psoriasis as a T-cell–mediated disorder 
has directed therapeutic efforts to immunoregulation. Cyclosporine 
and  other  immunosuppressive  agents  can  be  very  effective  in  the 
treatment  of  psoriasis,  and  much  attention  is  currently  directed 
toward the development of biologic agents with more selective immu-
nosuppressive  properties  and  better  safety  profiles  (Table  57-4). 
These  biologic  agents  appear  to  be  quite  efficacious  in  treatment 
of  psoriasis  and  are  well  tolerated;  however,  caution  with  certain 
patient  comorbidities  must  be  exercised.  Use  of  tumor  necrosis 
factor-α  (TNF-α)  inhibitors  may  worsen  congestive  heart  failure 
(CHF), and they should be used with caution in patients at risk for 
or  known  to  have  CHF.  Further,  none  of  the  immunosuppressive 
agents used in the treatment of psoriasis should be initiated if the 
patient has a severe infection (including tuberculosis, HIV, hepati-
tis B or C); patients on such therapy should be routinely screened 
for tuberculosis. There have been reports of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy and lupus erythematosus in association with 
treatment with the TNF-α inhibitors. Malignancies, including a risk 
or history of certain malignancies, may limit the use of these sys-
temic agents. In general, immunosuppressive agents have also been 
linked to an increase risk of skin cancer, and patients receiving these 
agents should be monitored for the development of skin cancer.

Treatment of psoriasis depends on the type, location, and extent of 
disease. All patients should be instructed to avoid excess drying or 
irritation of their skin and to maintain adequate cutaneous hydra-
tion. Most cases of localized, plaque-type psoriasis can be managed 

 ■ LICHEN PLANUS
Lichen planus (LP) is a papulosquamous disorder that may affect the 
skin,  scalp,  nails,  and  mucous  membranes.  The  primary  cutaneous 
lesions  are  pruritic,  polygonal,  flat-topped,  violaceous  papules.  Close

examination  of  the  surface  of  these  papules  often  reveals  a  network 
of gray lines (Wickham’s striae). The skin lesions may occur anywhere 
but have a predilection for the wrists, shins, lower back, and genitalia 
(Fig. 57-5). Involvement of the scalp (lichen planopilaris) may lead to 
scarring alopecia, and nail involvement may lead to permanent defor-
mity or loss of fingernails and toenails. LP commonly involves mucous 
membranes,  particularly  the  buccal  mucosa,  where  it  can  present 
on a spectrum ranging from a mild, white, reticulate eruption of the 
mucosa  to  a  severe,  erosive  stomatitis.  Erosive  stomatitis  may  persist 
for years and may be linked to an increased risk of oral squamous cell 
carcinoma.  Cutaneous  eruptions  clinically  resembling  LP  have  been 
observed  after  administration  of  numerous  drugs,  including  thiazide 
diuretics, gold, antimalarial agents, penicillamine, and phenothiazines, 
and in patients with skin lesions of chronic graft-versus-host disease. 
In  addition,  LP  may  be  associated  with  hepatitis  C  infection.  The 
course of LP is variable, but most patients have spontaneous remissions  
6 months to 2 years after the onset of disease. Topical glucocorticoids 
are the mainstay of therapy.
 ■ PITYRIASIS ROSEA
Pityriasis  rosea  (PR)  is  a  papulosquamous  eruption  of  unknown  eti-
ology occurring more commonly in the spring and fall. Its first mani-
festation is the development of a 2- to 6-cm annular lesion (the herald 
patch). This is followed in a few days to a few weeks by the appearance 
of many smaller annular or papular lesions with a predilection to occur 
on the trunk (Fig. 57-6). The lesions are generally oval, with their long 

axis parallel to the skinfold lines. Individual lesions may range in color 
from red to brown and have a trailing scale. PR shares many clinical 
features  with  the  eruption  of  secondary  syphilis,  but  palm  and  sole 
lesions  are  extremely  rare  in  PR  and  common  in  secondary  syphilis. 
The  eruption  tends  to  be  moderately  pruritic  and  lasts  3–8  weeks. 
Treatment is directed at alleviating pruritus and consists of oral anti-
histamines;  mid-potency  topical  glucocorticoids;  and,  in  some  cases, 
UVB phototherapy.

CUTANEOUS INFECTIONS (TABLE 57-5)
 ■ IMPETIGO, ECTHYMA, AND FURUNCULOSIS
Impetigo  is  a  common  superficial  bacterial  infection  of  skin  caused 
most  often  by  S.  aureus  (Chap.  147)  and  in  some  cases  by  group  A 
β-hemolytic streptococci (Chap. 148). The primary lesion is a super-
ficial  pustule  that  ruptures  and  forms  a  characteristic  yellow-brown 
honey-colored  crust  (see Chap. 148, Fig. 148-3).  Lesions  may  occur 
on  normal  skin  (primary  infection)  or  in  areas  already  affected  by 
another  skin  disease  (secondary  infection).  Lesions  caused  by  staph-
ylococci may be tense, clear bullae, and this less common form of the 
disease is called bullous impetigo. Blisters are caused by the production 
of exfoliative toxin by S. aureus phage type II. This is the same toxin 
responsible for staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome, often resulting 
in  dramatic  loss  of  the  superficial  epidermis  due  to  blistering.  The 
latter  syndrome  is  much  more  common  in  children  than  in  adults; 
however, it should be considered along with toxic epidermal necrolysis

and  severe  drug  eruptions  in  patients  with  widespread  blistering  of 
the skin. Ecthyma is a deep nonbullous variant of impetigo that causes 
punched-out ulcerative lesions. It is more often caused by a primary or 
secondary infection with Streptococcus pyogenes. Ecthyma is a deeper 
infection than typical impetigo and resolves with scars. Treatment of 
both  ecthyma  and  impetigo  involves  gentle  debridement  of  adherent 
crusts, facilitated by using soaks and topical antibiotics in conjunction 
with appropriate oral antibiotics.

Furunculosis is also caused by S. aureus, and this disorder has gained 
prominence in the past few decades because of CA-MRSA. A furuncle, 
or boil, is a painful, erythematous nodule that can occur on any cuta-
neous surface. The lesions may be solitary but are most often multiple. 
Patients frequently believe they have been bitten by spiders or insects. 
Family members or close contacts may also be affected. Furuncles can 
rupture and drain spontaneously or may need incision and drainage, 
which  may  be  adequate  therapy  for  small  solitary  furuncles  without 
cellulitis or systemic symptoms. Whenever possible, lesional material 
should be sent for culture. Current recommendations for methicillin-
sensitive infections are β-lactam antibiotics. Therapy for CA-MRSA is 
discussed previously (see “Atopic Dermatitis”). Warm compresses and 
nasal  mupirocin  are  helpful  therapeutic  additions.  Severe  infections 
may require IV antibiotics.
 ■ ERYSIPELAS AND CELLULITIS
See Chap. 129.
 ■ DERMATOPHYTOSIS
Dermatophytes are fungi that infect skin, hair, and nails and include 
members of the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophy-
ton (Chap. 219). Tinea corporis, or infection of the relatively hairless 
skin  of  the  body  (glabrous  skin),  may  have  a  variable  appearance 
depending on the extent of the associated inflammatory reaction. Typ-
ical infections consist of erythematous, scaly plaques, with an annular 
appearance  that  accounts  for  the  common  name  “ringworm.”  Deep 
inflammatory nodules or granulomas occur in some infections, most 
often those inappropriately treated with mid- to high-potency topical 
glucocorticoids. Involvement of the groin (tinea cruris) is more com-
mon in males than in females. It presents as a scaling, erythematous 
eruption  sparing  the  scrotum.  Infection  of  the  foot  (tinea  pedis)  is 
the  most  common  dermatophyte  infection  and  is  often  chronic;  it  is 
characterized by variable erythema, edema, scaling, pruritus, and occa-
sionally  vesiculation.  The  infection  may  be  widespread  or  localized 
but generally involves the web space between the fourth and fifth toes. 
Infection of the nails (tinea unguium or onychomycosis) occurs in many 
patients with tinea pedis and is characterized by opacified, thickened 
nails and subungual debris. The distal-lateral variant is most common. 
Proximal subungual onychomycosis may be a marker for HIV infec-
tion or other immunocompromised states. Dermatophyte infection of 
the scalp (tinea capitis) continues to be common, particularly affecting 
inner-city  children  but  also  affecting  immunocompromised  adults. 
The predominant organism is Trichophyton tonsurans, which can pro-
duce a relatively noninflammatory infection with mild scale and hair 

loss  that  is  diffuse  or  localized.  T.  tonsurans  and  Microsporum  canis 
can also cause a markedly inflammatory dermatosis with edema and 
nodules. This latter presentation is a kerion.

The diagnosis of tinea can be made from skin scrapings, nail scrap-
ings, or hair by culture or direct microscopic examination with KOH. 
Nail  clippings  may  be  sent  for  histologic  examination  with  periodic 
acid–Schiff (PAS) stain.

TREATMENT
Dermatophytosis

Both topical and systemic therapies may be used in dermatophyte 
infections. Treatment depends on the site involved and the type of 
infection.  Topical  therapy  is  generally  effective  for  uncomplicated 
tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and limited tinea pedis. Topical agents 
are not effective as monotherapy for tinea capitis or onychomycosis 
(see below), and nystatin is not active against dermatophytes. Topi-
cals are generally applied twice daily, and treatment should continue 
for 1 week beyond clinical resolution of the infection. Tinea pedis 
often  requires  longer  treatment  courses  and  frequently  relapses. 
Oral antifungal agents may be required for recalcitrant tinea pedis 
or tinea corporis.

For  dermatophyte  infections  involving  the  hair  and  nails  and 
for other infections unresponsive to topical therapy, oral antifungal 
agents  are  often  used.  Markedly  inflammatory  tinea  capitis  may 
result in scarring and hair loss, and a systemic antifungal agent plus 
systemic  or  topical  glucocorticoids  may  be  helpful  in  preventing 
these  sequelae.  A  fungal  etiology  should  be  confirmed  by  direct 
microscopic examination or by culture before oral antifungal agents 
are prescribed for any infection. All the oral agents may cause hepa-
totoxicity. They should not be used in women who are pregnant or 
breast-feeding.

Griseofulvin  is  approved  in  the  United  States  for  dermato-
phyte  infections  involving  the  skin,  hair,  or  nails.  Common  side 
effects  of  griseofulvin  include  gastrointestinal  distress,  headache, 
and urticaria.

Two  other  oral  antifungal  agents,  itraconazole  and  terbinafine, 
are  sometimes  prescribed  “off-label”  for  superficial  fungal  infec-
tions.  Oral  itraconazole  is  approved  for  onychomycosis.  Itraco-
nazole  has  the  potential  for  serious  interactions  with  other  drugs 
requiring  the  P450  enzyme  system  for  metabolism.  Itraconazole 
should not be administered to patients with evidence of ventricular 
dysfunction or patients with known CHF.

Terbinafine is also approved for onychomycosis, and the granule 
version is approved for treatment of tinea capitis. Terbinafine has 
fewer  interactions  with  other  drugs  than  itraconazole;  however, 
caution should be used with patients who are on multiple medica-
tions. The risk/benefit ratio should be considered when an asymp-
tomatic toenail infection is treated with systemic agents.

The FDA has limited the use of a third oral agent due to potential 
hepatotoxicity and published the following: “Nizoral [ketoconazole]

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases 
oral  tablets  should  not  be  a  first-line  treatment  for  any  fungal 
infection.” The topical form of ketoconazole is not affected by this  
action.

 ■ TINEA (PITYRIASIS) VERSICOLOR
Tinea versicolor is caused by a nondermatophytic, dimorphic fungus, 
Malassezia furfur, a normal inhabitant of the skin. The expression of 
infection is promoted by heat and humidity. The typical lesions consist 
of oval scaly macules, papules, and patches concentrated on the chest, 
shoulders, and back but only rarely on the face or distal extremities. On 
dark skin, the lesions often appear as hypopigmented areas, whereas on 
light skin, they are slightly erythematous or hyperpigmented. A KOH 
preparation from scaling lesions will demonstrate a confluence of short 
hyphae and round spores (“spaghetti and meatballs”). Lotions or sham-
poos containing sulfur, salicylic acid, or selenium sulfide are the treat-
ments of choice and will clear the infection if used daily for 1–2 weeks 
and then weekly thereafter. These preparations are irritating if left on 
the skin for >10 min; thus, they should be washed off completely. Treat-
ment with some oral antifungal agents is also effective, but they do not 
provide lasting results and are not FDA approved for this indication.
 ■ CANDIDIASIS
Candidiasis  is  a  fungal  infection  caused  by  a  related  group  of  yeasts 
whose manifestations may be localized to the skin and mucous mem-
branes  or,  rarely,  may  be  systemic  and  life-threatening  (Chap.  216). 
The causative organism is usually Candida albicans. These organisms 
are  normal  saprophytic  inhabitants  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  but 
may  overgrow  due  to  broad-spectrum  antibiotic  therapy,  diabetes 
mellitus,  or  immunosuppression  and  cause  disease.  Candidiasis  is  a 
very common infection in HIV-infected individuals (Chap. 202). The 
oral  cavity  is  commonly  involved.  Lesions  may  occur  on  the  tongue 
or  buccal  mucosa  (thrush)  and  appear  as  white  plaques.  Fissured, 
macerated lesions at the corners of the mouth (perlèche) are often seen 
in individuals with poorly fitting dentures and may also be associated 
with candidal infection. In addition, candidal infections have an affin-
ity for sites that are chronically wet and macerated, including the skin 
around nails (onycholysis and paronychia), and in intertriginous areas. 
Intertriginous lesions are characteristically edematous, erythematous, 
and  scaly,  with  scattered  “satellite  pustules.”  In  males,  there  is  often 
involvement  of  the  penis  and  scrotum  as  well  as  the  inner  aspect  of 
the thighs. In contrast to dermatophyte infections, candidal infections 
are  frequently  painful  and  accompanied  by  a  marked  inflammatory 
response. Diagnosis of candidal infection is based on the clinical pat-
tern and demonstration of yeast on KOH preparation or culture.

TREATMENT
Candidiasis

Treatment  involves  removal  of  any  predisposing  factors  such  as 
antibiotic  therapy  or  chronic  moisture  and  the  use  of  appropriate 
topical  or  systemic  antifungal  agents.  Effective  topicals  include 
nystatin  or  azoles  (miconazole,  clotrimazole,  econazole,  or  keto-
conazole).  The  associated  inflammatory  response  accompanying 
candidal  infection  on  glabrous  skin  can  be  treated  with  a  mild 
glucocorticoid  lotion  or  cream  (2.5%  hydrocortisone).  Systemic 
therapy  is  usually  reserved  for  immunosuppressed  patients  or 
individuals  with  chronic  or  recurrent  disease  who  fail  to  respond 
to appropriate topical therapy. Oral fluconazole is most commonly 
prescribed for cutaneous candidiasis. Oral nystatin is effective only 
for candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract.

 ■ WARTS
Warts are cutaneous neoplasms caused by papillomaviruses. More than 
100  different  human  papillomaviruses  (HPVs)  have  been  described. 
A  typical  wart,  verruca  vulgaris,  is  sessile,  dome-shaped,  and  usually 
about a centimeter in diameter. Its surface is hyperkeratotic, consisting 
of many small filamentous projections. HPV also causes typical plan-
tar warts, flat warts (verruca plana), and filiform warts. Plantar warts

are  endophytic  and  are  covered  by  thick  keratin.  Paring  of  the  wart 
will generally reveal a central core of keratinized debris and punctate 
bleeding points. Filiform warts are commonly seen on the face, neck, 
and skinfolds and present as papillomatous lesions on a narrow base. 
Flat warts are only slightly elevated and have a velvety, nonverrucous 
surface.  They  have  a  propensity  for  the  face,  arms,  and  legs,  and  are 
often spread by shaving.

Genital warts begin as small papillomas that may grow to form large, 
fungating lesions. In women, they may involve the labia, perineum, or 
perianal skin. In addition, the mucosa of the vagina, urethra, and anus 
can be involved as well as the cervical epithelium. In men, the lesions 
often occur initially in the coronal sulcus but may be seen on the shaft 
of the penis, the scrotum, or the perianal skin or in the urethra.

Appreciable evidence has accumulated indicating that HPV plays a 
role in the development of neoplasia of the uterine cervix and anogen-
ital  skin  (Chap. 89).  HPV  types  16  and  18  have  been  most  intensely 
studied and are the major risk factors for intraepithelial neoplasia and 
squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  cervix,  anus,  vulva,  and  penis.  The 
risk  is  higher  among  patients  immunosuppressed  after  solid  organ 
transplantation and among those infected with HIV. Recent evidence 
also  implicates  other  HPV  types.  Histologic  examination  of  biopsied 
samples from affected sites may reveal changes associated with typical 
warts and/or features typical of intraepidermal carcinoma (Bowen’s dis-
ease). Squamous cell carcinomas associated with HPV infections have 
also  been  observed  in  extragenital  skin  (Chap.  76),  most  commonly 
in patients immunosuppressed after organ transplantation. Patients on 
long-term immunosuppression should be monitored for the develop-
ment of squamous cell carcinoma and other cutaneous malignancies.

TREATMENT
Warts

Treatment  of  warts,  other  than  anogenital  warts,  should  be  tem-
pered  by  the  observation  that  most  warts  in  normal  individuals 
resolve spontaneously within 1–2 years. There are many modalities 
available to treat warts, but no single therapy is universally effective. 
Factors that influence the choice of therapy include the location of 
the wart, the extent of disease, the age and immunologic status of 
the  patient,  and  the  patient’s  desire  for  therapy.  Perhaps  the  most 
useful and convenient method for treating warts in almost any loca-
tion is cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen. Equally effective for non-
genital warts, but requiring much more patient compliance, is the 
use of keratolytic agents such as salicylic acid plasters or solutions. 
For genital warts, in-office application of a podophyllin solution is 
moderately effective but may be associated with marked local reac-
tions. Prescription preparations of dilute, purified podophyllin are 
available for home use. Topical imiquimod, a potent inducer of local 
cytokine release, has been approved for treatment of genital warts. 
A topical compound composed of green tea extracts (sinecatechins) 
is  also  available.  Conventional  and  laser  surgical  procedures  may 
be required for recalcitrant warts. Recurrence of warts appears to 
be  common  with  all  these  modalities.  A  highly  effective  vaccine 
for selected types of HPV has been approved by the FDA, and its 
use is reported to reduce the incidence of anogenital and cervical 
carcinoma.

ACNE
 ■ ACNE VULGARIS
Acne  vulgaris  is  a  self-limited  disorder  primarily  of  teenagers  and 
young  adults,  although  perhaps  10–20%  of  adults  may  continue  to 
experience  some  form  of  the  disorder.  The  permissive  factor  for  the

expression  of  the  disease  in  adolescence  is  the  increase  in  sebum 
production by sebaceous glands with puberty. Small cysts, called come-
dones, form in hair follicles due to blockage of the follicular orifice by 
retention  of  keratinous  material  and  sebum.  The  activity  of  bacteria 
(Cutibacterium  acnes)  within  the  comedones  releases  free  fatty  acids 
from sebum, causes inflammation within the cyst, and results in rup-
ture of the cyst wall. An inflammatory foreign-body reaction develops 
as result of extrusion of oily and keratinous debris from the cyst.

The clinical hallmark of acne vulgaris is the comedone, which may 
be closed (whitehead) or open (blackhead). Closed comedones appear 
as 1- to 2-mm pebbly white papules, which are accentuated when the 
skin  is  stretched.  They  are  the  precursors  of  inflammatory  lesions 
of  acne  vulgaris.  The  contents  of  closed  comedones  are  not  easily 
expressed.  Open  comedones,  which  rarely  result  in  inflammatory 
acne lesions, have a dilated follicular orifice and are filled with easily 
expressible  oxidized,  darkened,  oily  debris.  Comedones  are  usually 
accompanied by inflammatory lesions: papules, pustules, or nodules.

The  earliest  lesions  seen  in  adolescence  are  generally  mildly 
inflamed  or  noninflammatory  comedones  on  the  forehead.  Subse-
quently,  more  typical  inflammatory  lesions  develop  on  the  cheeks, 
nose, and chin (Fig. 57-7). The most common location for acne is the 
face, but involvement of the chest and back is common. Most disease 
remains mild and does not lead to scarring. A small number of patients 
develop large inflammatory cysts and nodules, which may drain and 
result in significant scarring. Regardless of the severity, acne may affect 
a patient’s quality of life. With adequate treatment, this effect may be 
transient. In the case of severe, scarring acne, the effects can be per-
manent  and  profound.  Early  therapeutic  intervention  in  severe  acne 
is essential.

Exogenous and endogenous factors can alter the expression of acne 
vulgaris. Friction and trauma (from headbands or chin straps of ath-
letic  helmets),  application  of  comedogenic  topical  agents  (cosmetics 
or hair preparations), or chronic topical exposure to certain industrial 
compounds  may  elicit  or  aggravate  acne.  Glucocorticoids,  topical  or 
systemic,  may  also  elicit  acne.  Other  systemic  medications  such  as 
progestin-only contraception, lithium, isoniazid, androgenic steroids, 
halogens,  phenytoin,  and  phenobarbital  may  produce  acneiform 
eruptions or aggravate preexisting acne. Genetic factors and polycystic 
ovary disease may also play a role.

TREATMENT
Acne Vulgaris

Treatment of acne vulgaris is directed toward elimination of come-
dones by normalizing follicular keratinization and decreasing seba-
ceous gland activity, the population of C. acnes, and inflammation. 
Minimal  to  moderate  pauci-inflammatory  disease  may  respond 
adequately  to  local  therapy  alone.  Although  areas  affected  with 
acne  should  be  kept  clean,  overly  vigorous  scrubbing  may  aggra-
vate acne due to mechanical rupture of comedones. Topical agents 
such as retinoic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or salicylic acid may alter 

the  pattern  of  epidermal  desquamation,  preventing  the  formation 
of  comedones  and  aiding  in  the  resolution  of  preexisting  cysts. 
Topical antibacterial agents (such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, 
erythromycin, clindamycin, or dapsone) are also useful adjuncts to 
therapy. Topical antibiotics (erythromycin and clindamycin) should 
be used in combination with benzoyl peroxide to prevent develop-
ment of bacterial resistance.

Patients with moderate to severe acne with a prominent inflam-
matory component will benefit from the addition of systemic ther-
apy, such as minocycline or doxycycline in doses of 100 mg bid or in 
lower dose, extended-release preparations. Such antibiotics appear 
to have anti-inflammatory effects independent of their antibacterial 
effects. Female patients who do not respond to oral antibiotics may 
benefit from hormonal therapy. Several oral contraceptives are now 
approved  by  the  FDA  for  use  in  the  treatment  of  acne  vulgaris. 
Spironolactone is emerging as a safe, effective, and durable antian-
drogen treatment in women.

Patients  with  severe  nodulocystic  acne  unresponsive  to  the 
therapies  discussed  above  may  benefit  from  treatment  with  the 
synthetic retinoid isotretinoin. Dosing is weight-based and cumu-
lative, with duration of therapy dictated by summative dose or acne 
lesion  remission.  Results  are  excellent  in  appropriately  selected 
patients.  Its  use  is  highly  regulated  due  to  its  potential  for  severe 
adverse events, primarily teratogenicity and depression. In addition, 
patients receiving this medication develop dry skin and cheilitis and 
must be followed for development of hypertriglyceridemia.

At present, prescribers must enroll in a program designed to pre-
vent pregnancy and adverse events while patients are taking isotre-
tinoin. These measures are imposed to ensure that all prescribers 
are  familiar  with  the  risks  of  isotretinoin,  that  all  female  patients 
have two negative pregnancy tests prior to initiation of therapy and 
a negative pregnancy test prior to each refill, and that all patients 
have been warned about the risks associated with isotretinoin.

 ■ ACNE ROSACEA
Acne rosacea, commonly referred to simply as rosacea, is an inflamma-
tory  disorder  predominantly  affecting  the  central  face.  Persons  most 
often  affected  are  Caucasians  of  northern  European  background,  but 
rosacea also occurs in patients with dark skin. Rosacea is seen almost 
exclusively in adults, only rarely affecting patients <30 years old. Rosacea 
is more common in women, but those most severely affected are men. 
It  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  erythema,  telangiectasias,  and 
superficial pustules (Fig. 57-8) but is not associated with the presence 
of comedones. Rosacea rarely involves the chest or back.

There is a relationship between the tendency for facial flushing and 
the  subsequent  development  of  acne  rosacea.  Often,  individuals  with 
rosacea  initially  demonstrate  a  pronounced  flushing  reaction.  This 
may be in response to heat, emotional stimuli, alcohol, hot drinks, or 
spicy  foods.  As  the  disease  progresses,  the  flush  persists  longer  and 
longer and may eventually become permanent. Papules, pustules, and

cea  of  very  long  standing  may  lead  to  connective  tissue  overgrowth, 
particularly  of  the  nose  (rhinophyma).  Rosacea  may  also  be  compli-
cated by various inflammatory disorders of the eye, including keratitis, 
blepharitis, iritis, and recurrent chalazion. These ocular problems are 
potentially sight-threatening and warrant ophthalmologic evaluation.

TREATMENT
Acne Rosacea

Acne rosacea can be treated topically or systemically. Mild disease 
often  responds  to  topical  preparations  of  metronidazole,  sodium 
sulfacetamide,  azelaic  acid,  ivermectin,  brimonidine,  or  oxyme-
tazoline. More severe disease requires oral tetracyclines in suban-
timicrobial,  modified-release  preparations.  Residual  telangiectasia 
may  respond  to  laser  therapy.  Topical  glucocorticoids,  especially 
potent agents, should be avoided because chronic use of these prep-
arations may elicit rosacea. Application of topical agents to the skin 
is not effective treatment for ocular disease.

SKIN DISEASES AND SMALLPOX 
VACCINATION
Although  smallpox  vaccinations  were  discontinued  several  decades 
ago for the general population, they are still required for certain mil-
itary personnel and first responders. In the absence of a bioterrorism 
attack and a real or potential exposure to smallpox, such vaccination is 
contraindicated in persons with a history of skin diseases, such as AD, 
eczema, and psoriasis, who have a higher incidence of adverse events 
associated with smallpox vaccination. In the case of such exposure, the 
risk  of  smallpox  infection  outweighs  that  of  adverse  events  from  the 
vaccine (Chap. S3).

PAPULOSQUAMOUS SKIN LESIONS
(Table  58-1)  When  an  eruption  is  characterized  by  elevated  lesions, 
either papules (<1 cm) or plaques (>1 cm), in association with scale, 
it  is  referred  to  as  papulosquamous.  The  most  common  papulosqua-
mous diseases—tinea, psoriasis, pityriasis rosea, and lichen planus—are 
primary  cutaneous  disorders  (Chap.  57).  When  psoriatic  lesions  are 
accompanied by arthritis, the possibility of psoriatic arthritis or reac-
tive arthritis should be considered. A history of oral ulcers, conjuncti-
vitis, uveitis, and/or urethritis points to the latter diagnosis. Lithium, 
beta  blockers,  anti-PD-1/PD-L1  antibodies,  HIV  or  streptococcal 
infections,  and  a  rapid  taper  of  systemic  glucocorticoids  are  known 
to  exacerbate  psoriasis;  despite  being  used  to  treat  psoriasis,  tumor 
necrosis  factor  (TNF)  inhibitors  can  also  induce  psoriatic  lesions. 
Comorbidities in patients with psoriasis include cardiovascular disease 
and metabolic syndrome.

Whenever the clinical diagnosis of pityriasis rosea or lichen planus 
is  made,  it  is  important  to  review  the  patient’s  medications  because 
the eruption may resolve by simply discontinuing the offending agent. 
Pityriasis  rosea–like  drug  eruptions  are  seen  most  commonly  with 
beta  blockers,  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors,  and 
metronidazole, whereas the drugs that can produce a lichenoid erup-
tion  include  thiazides,  antimalarials,  quinidine,  beta  blockers,  TNF 
inhibitors, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, and ACE inhibitors. In some 
populations (e.g., Europeans), there is a higher prevalence of hepatitis 
C viral infection in patients with oral lichen planus. Lichen planus–like 
lesions are also observed in chronic graft-versus-host disease.

In  its  early  stages,  the  mycosis  fungoides  (MF)  form  of  cutaneous 
T-cell  lymphoma  (CTCL)  may  be  confused  with  eczema  or  psoriasis, 
but it often eventually fails to respond to appropriate therapy for those 
inflammatory diseases. MF can develop within lesions of large-plaque 
parapsoriasis  and  is  suggested  by  an  increase  in  the  thickness  of  the 
lesions.  The  diagnosis  of  MF  is  established  by  skin  biopsy  in  which 

58 Skin Manifestations of 
Internal Disease
Jean L. Bolognia, Jonathan S. Leventhal,  
Irwin M. Braverman

It is a generally accepted concept in medicine that the skin can develop 
signs  of  internal  disease.  Therefore,  in  textbooks  of  medicine,  one 
finds  a  chapter  describing  in  detail  the  major  systemic  disorders  that 
can  be  identified  by  cutaneous  signs.  The  underlying  assumption  of 
such a chapter is that the clinician has been able to identify the specific 
disorder in the patient and needs only to read about it in the textbook. 
In reality, concise differential diagnoses and the identification of these 
disorders  are  actually  difficult  for  the  nondermatologist  because  he 
or  she  is  not  well-versed  in  the  recognition  of  cutaneous  lesions  or 
their  spectrum  of  presentations.  Therefore,  this  chapter  covers  this 
particular  topic  of  cutaneous  medicine  not  by  simply  focusing  on

collections of atypical T lymphocytes are found in the epidermis and 
dermis. As the disease progresses, cutaneous tumors and lymph node 
involvement may appear.

In secondary syphilis, there are scattered pink to red-brown papules 
with thin scale. The eruption often involves the palms and soles and 
can resemble pityriasis rosea. Associated findings are helpful in making 
the diagnosis and include nonscarring alopecia, annular plaques on the 
face,  mucous  patches,  condyloma  lata  (broad-based  and  moist),  and 
lymphadenopathy,  as  well  as  malaise,  fever,  headache,  and  myalgias. 
The interval between the primary chancre and the secondary stage is 
usually  4–8  weeks,  and  spontaneous  resolution  without  appropriate 
therapy occurs.

ERYTHRODERMA
(Table 58-2) Erythroderma is the term used when the majority of the 
skin surface is erythematous (red in color). There may be associated 
scale,  erosions,  or  pustules  as  well  as  shedding  of  the  hair  and  nails. 
Potential  systemic  manifestations  include  fever,  chills,  hypothermia, 
reactive lymphadenopathy, peripheral edema, hypoalbuminemia, and 
high-output cardiac failure. The major etiologies of erythroderma are 
(1) cutaneous diseases such as psoriasis and dermatitis (Table 58-3); 
(2) drugs; (3) systemic diseases, most commonly CTCL; and (4) idio-
pathic.  In  the  first  three  groups,  the  location  and  description  of  the 
initial lesions, prior to the development of the erythroderma, aid in the 
diagnosis.  For  example,  a  history  of  red  scaly  plaques  on  the  elbows 
and knees would point to psoriasis. It is also important to examine the 
skin carefully for a migration of the erythema and associated secondary 
changes  such  as  pustules  or  erosions.  Migratory  waves  of  erythema 
studded with superficial pustules are seen in pustular psoriasis.

Drug-induced erythroderma may begin as an exanthematous (mor-
billiform)  eruption  (Chap.  60)  or  may  arise  as  diffuse  erythema.  A 
number of drugs can produce an erythroderma, including penicillins, 
sulfonamides,  aromatic  anticonvulsants  (e.g.,  carbamazepine,  pheny-
toin), and allopurinol. Fever and peripheral eosinophilia often accom-
pany  the  eruption,  and  there  may  also  be  facial  swelling,  hepatitis, 
myocarditis, thyroiditis, and allergic interstitial nephritis; this constel-
lation  is  frequently  referred  to  as  drug  reaction  with  eosinophilia  and 
systemic symptoms (DRESS) or drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome 
(DIHS). In addition, these reactions, especially to aromatic anticonvul-
sants, can lead to a pseudolymphoma syndrome with adenopathy and 
circulating atypical lymphocytes, while reactions to allopurinol may be 
accompanied by gastrointestinal bleeding.

The most common malignancy that is associated with erythroderma 
is CTCL; in some series, up to 25% of the cases of erythroderma were due 
to CTCL. The patient may progress from isolated plaques and tumors, 
but more commonly, the erythroderma is present throughout the course 
of the disease (Sézary syndrome). In Sézary syndrome, there are circu-
lating  clonal  atypical  T  lymphocytes,  pruritus,  and  lymphadenopathy. 
In cases of erythroderma where there is no apparent cause (idiopathic), 
longitudinal evaluation is mandatory to monitor for the possible devel-
opment of CTCL.

ALOPECIA
(Table 58-4) The two major forms of alopecia are scarring and non-
scarring.  Scarring  alopecia  is  associated  with  fibrosis,  inflammation, 
and loss of hair follicles. A smooth scalp with a decreased number of 
follicular openings is usually observed clinically, but in some patients, 
the changes are seen only in biopsy specimens from affected areas. In 
nonscarring alopecia, the hair shafts are absent or miniaturized, but the 
hair follicles are preserved, explaining the reversible nature of nonscar-
ring alopecia.

The most common causes of nonscarring alopecia include androge-
netic alopecia, telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, tinea capitis, and the 
early phase of traumatic alopecia (Table 58-5). In women with andro-
genetic alopecia, an elevation in circulating levels of androgens may be 
seen as a result of ovarian or adrenal gland dysfunction or neoplasm. 
When there are signs of virilization, such as a deepened voice and/or 
enlarged clitoris, the possibility of an ovarian or adrenal gland tumor 
should be considered.

Exposure to various drugs can also cause diffuse hair loss, usually 
by  inducing  a  telogen  effluvium.  An  exception  is  the  anagen  efflu-
vium observed with chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin. 
Alopecia  is  a  side  effect  of  the  following  drugs:  warfarin,  heparin, 
propylthiouracil,  carbimazole,  isotretinoin,  acitretin,  lithium,  beta 
blockers,  interferons,  colchicine,  and  amphetamines.  Fortunately, 
spontaneous regrowth usually follows discontinuation of the offend-
ing agent.

Less  commonly,  nonscarring  alopecia  is  associated  with  lupus  
erythematosus and secondary syphilis. In systemic lupus, there are two 
forms  of  alopecia—one  is  scarring  secondary  to  discoid  lesions  (see 
below),  and  the  other  is  nonscarring.  The  latter  form  coincides  with 
flares of systemic disease and may involve the entire scalp or just the 
frontal scalp, with the appearance of multiple short hairs (“lupus hairs”) 
as a sign of initial regrowth. Scattered, poorly circumscribed patches of 
alopecia with a “moth-eaten” appearance are a manifestation of the sec-
ondary stage of syphilis. Diffuse thinning of the hair is also associated 
with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (Table 58-4).

Scarring alopecia is more frequently the result of a primary cutane-
ous  disorder  such  as  lichen  planus,  chronic  cutaneous  (discoid)  lupus, 
central  centrifugal  cicatricial  alopecia,  folliculitis  decalvans,  or  linear 
scleroderma (morphea) than it is a sign of systemic disease. Although 
the scarring lesions of discoid lupus can be seen in patients with sys-
temic lupus, in the majority of patients, the disease process is limited to 
the skin. Less common causes of scarring alopecia include sarcoidosis 
(see  “Papulonodular  Skin  Lesions,”  below),  chemotherapeutic  agents, 
and cutaneous metastases.

In  the  early  phases  of  discoid  lupus,  lichen  planus,  and  folliculitis 
decalvans, there are circumscribed areas of alopecia. Fibrosis and sub-
sequent loss of hair follicles are observed primarily in the center of these 
alopecic patches, whereas the inflammatory process is most prominent 
at the periphery. The areas of active inflammation in discoid lupus are 
erythematous with scale, whereas the areas of previous inflammation 
are often hypopigmented with a rim of hyperpigmentation. In lichen 
planus,  perifollicular  macules  at  the  periphery  are  usually  violet- 
colored.  A  complete  examination  of  the  skin  and  oral  mucosa  com-
bined  with  a  biopsy  and  direct  immunofluorescence  microscopy  of 
inflamed skin will aid in distinguishing these two entities. The periph-
eral active lesions in folliculitis decalvans are follicular pustules; these 
patients can develop a reactive arthritis.
FIGURATE SKIN LESIONS
(Table  58-6)  In  figurate  eruptions,  the  lesions  form  rings  and  arcs 
that are usually erythematous but can be skin-colored to brown. Most 
commonly, they are due to primary cutaneous diseases such as tinea, 
urticaria,  granuloma  annulare,  and  erythema  annulare  centrifugum 
(Chaps. 57 and 59). An underlying systemic illness is found in a sec-
ond, less common group of migratory annular erythemas. It includes 
erythema  migrans,  erythema  gyratum  repens,  erythema  marginatum, 
and necrolytic migratory erythema.

In erythema gyratum repens, one sees numerous mobile concentric 
arcs and wavefronts that resemble the grain in wood. A search for an

Erythema  migrans  is  the  cutaneous  manifestation  of  Lyme  disease, 
which  is  caused  by  the  spirochete  Borrelia  burgdorferi.  In  the  initial 
stage (3–30 days after tick bite), a single annular lesion is usually seen, 
which can expand to ≥10 cm in diameter. Within several days, up to 
half  of  the  patients  develop  multiple  smaller  erythematous  lesions  at 
sites distant from the bite. Associated symptoms include fever, head-
ache,  photophobia,  myalgias,  arthralgias,  and  malar  rash.  Erythema 
marginatum is seen in patients with rheumatic fever, primarily on the 
trunk.  Lesions  are  pink-red  in  color,  flat  to  minimally  elevated,  and 
transient.

There  are  additional  cutaneous  diseases  that  present  as  annular 
eruptions but lack an obvious migratory component. Examples include 
CTCL, subacute cutaneous lupus, secondary syphilis, and sarcoidosis (see 
“Papulonodular Skin Lesions,” below).

ACNE
(Table  58-7)  In  addition  to  acne  vulgaris  and  acne  rosacea,  the  two 
major forms of acne (Chap. 57), there are drugs and systemic diseases 
that can lead to acneiform eruptions.

criteria in the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College 
of Rheumatology (ACR) [2019] and ACR [1982] classification schemes for systemic 
lupus erythematosus. cCan involve underlying muscles and osseous structures, and 
rarely in linear morphea of the frontal scalp (en coup de sabre), there is involvement 
of the meninges and brain.

face, in particular telangiectasias, may mimic the clinical appearance of 
erythematotelangiectatic acne rosacea.

PUSTULAR LESIONS
Acneiform  eruptions  (see  “Acne,”  above)  and  folliculitis  represent  the 
most  common  pustular  dermatoses.  An  important  consideration  in 
the evaluation of follicular pustules is a determination of the associated 
pathogen, for example, normal flora (culture-negative), Staphylococcus 
aureus,  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  (“hot  tub”  folliculitis),  Malassezia, 
dermatophytes  (Majocchi’s  granuloma),  and  Demodex  spp.  Nonin-
fectious  forms  of  folliculitis  include  HIV-  or  immunosuppression- 
associated  eosinophilic  folliculitis  and  folliculitis  secondary  to  drugs 
such as glucocorticoids, lithium, and epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) or MEK inhibitors. Administration of high-dose systemic glu-
cocorticoids can result in a widespread eruption of follicular pustules 
on  the  trunk,  characterized  by  lesions  in  the  same  stage  of  develop-
ment. With regard to underlying systemic diseases, nonfollicular-based 
pustules are a characteristic component of pustular psoriasis (sterile) 
and  can  be  seen  in  septic  emboli  of  bacterial  or  fungal  origin  (see 
“Purpura,”  below).  In  patients  with  acute  generalized  exanthematous 
pustulosis (AGEP) due primarily to medications (e.g., cephalosporins), 
there are large areas of erythema studded with multiple sterile pustules 
in addition to neutrophilia.

TELANGIECTASIAS
(Table  58-8)  To  distinguish  the  various  types  of  telangiectasias,  it  is 
important to examine the shape and configuration of the dilated blood 
vessels.  Linear  telangiectasias  are  seen  on  the  face  of  patients  with 
actinically damaged skin and acne rosacea, and they are found on the 
legs of patients with venous hypertension and first appear on the legs 
in  generalized  essential  telangiectasia.  Patients  with  an  unusual  form 
of  mastocytosis  (telangiectasia  macularis  eruptiva  perstans)  and  the 
carcinoid syndrome (see “Acne,” above) also have linear telangiectasias. 
Lastly,  linear  telangiectasias  are  found  in  areas  of  cutaneous  inflam-
mation. For example, longstanding lesions of discoid lupus frequently 
have telangiectasias within them.

Poikiloderma  is  a  term  used  to  describe  a  patch  of  skin  with:  (1) 
reticulated  hypo-  and  hyperpigmentation,  (2)  wrinkling  secondary 
to  epidermal  atrophy,  and  (3)  telangiectasias.  Poikiloderma  does  not 
imply a single disease entity—although it is becoming less common, it 
is seen in skin damaged by ionizing radiation as well as in patients with 
autoimmune  connective  tissue  diseases,  primarily  dermatomyositis 
(DM), and rare genodermatoses (e.g., Kindler syndrome).

In  systemic  sclerosis  (scleroderma),  the  dilated  blood  vessels  have 
a  unique  configuration  and  are  known  as  mat  telangiectasias.  The 
lesions are broad macules that usually measure 2–7 mm in diameter 
but occasionally are larger. Mats have a polygonal or oval shape, and 
their erythematous color may appear uniform, but, upon closer inspec-
tion,  the  erythema  is  the  result  of  delicate  telangiectasias.  The  most 
common  locations  for  mat  telangiectasias  are  the  face,  oral  mucosa, 
and  hands—peripheral  sites  that  are  prone  to  intermittent  ischemia. 
The limited form of systemic sclerosis, also referred to as the CREST 
(calcinosis  cutis,  Raynaud’s  phenomenon,  esophageal  dysmotility, 
sclerodactyly,  and  telangiectasia)  variant  (Chap.  360),  is  associated 
with  a  chronic  course  and  anticentromere  antibodies.  Mat  telangiec-
tasias are an important clue to the diagnosis of this variant as well as 
the  diffuse  form  of  systemic  sclerosis  because  they  may  be  the  only  
cutaneous finding.

Nailfold telangiectasias are pathognomonic signs of the three major 
autoimmune connective tissue diseases: lupus erythematosus, systemic 
sclerosis,  and  DM.  They  are  easily  visualized  by  the  naked  eye  and 
occur in at least two-thirds of these patients. In both DM and lupus, 
there is associated nailfold erythema, and in DM, the erythema is often 
accompanied by “ragged” cuticles and fingertip tenderness. Under 10× 
magnification or by dermoscopy, the blood vessels in the nailfolds of 
lupus patients are tortuous and resemble “glomeruli,” whereas in sys-
temic sclerosis and DM, there is a loss of capillary loops and those that 
remain are markedly dilated.

In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Rendu-Weber dis-
ease),  the  lesions  usually  appear  during  adolescence  (mucosal)  and 
adulthood (cutaneous) and are most commonly seen on the mucous 
membranes (nasal, orolabial), face, and distal extremities, including 
under  the  nails.  They  represent  arteriovenous  (AV)  malformations 
of the dermal microvasculature, are dark red in color, and are usually 
slightly elevated. When the skin is stretched over an individual lesion, 
an eccentric punctum with radiating legs is seen. Although the degree 
of  systemic  involvement  varies  in  this  autosomal  dominant  disease 
(due primarily to mutations in either the endoglin or activin recep-
tor–like kinase gene), the major symptoms are recurrent epistaxis and 
gastrointestinal bleeding. The fact that these mucosal telangiectasias 
are  actually  AV  communications  helps  to  explain  their  tendency  to 
bleed.

HYPOPIGMENTATION
(Table  58-9)  Disorders  of  hypopigmentation  are  often  classified  as 
either diffuse or localized. The classic example of diffuse hypopigmen-
tation is oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). The most common forms are 
due to mutations in the tyrosinase gene (type I) or the P gene (type II); 
patients with type IA OCA have a total lack of enzyme activity. At birth, 
different forms of OCA can appear similar—white hair, gray-blue eyes, 
and pink-white skin. However, the patients with no tyrosinase activity 
maintain  this  phenotype,  whereas  those  with  decreased  activity  will 
acquire  some  pigmentation  of  the  eyes,  hair,  and  skin  as  they  age.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Diffuse shedding of normal hairs
Follows major stress (high fever, severe 
infection) or change in hormone levels 
(postpartum)
Reversible without treatment
Miniaturization of hairs along the 
midline of the scalp
Recession of the anterior scalp line in 
men and some women
Well-circumscribed, circular areas of 
hair loss, 2–5 cm in diameter
In extensive cases, coalescence of 
lesions and/or involvement of other hair-
bearing surfaces of the body
Pitting or sandpapered appearance of 
the nails
Varies from scaling with minimal hair 
loss to discrete patches with “black 
dots” (sites of broken infected hairs) to 
boggy plaque with pustules (kerion)b
Broken hairs, often of varying lengths
Irregular outline in trichotillomania and 
traction alopecia
Fringe sign in traction alopecia

PATHOGENESIS
Stress causes more of the asynchronous growth 
cycles of individual hairs to become synchronous; 
therefore, larger numbers of growing (anagen) hairs 
simultaneously enter the dying (telogen) phase

TREATMENT
Observation; discontinue any drugs that 
have alopecia as a side effect; must 
exclude underlying metabolic causes, e.g., 
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism

Increased sensitivity of affected hairs to the effects 
of androgens—most common
Increased levels of circulating androgens (ovarian 
or adrenal source in women)—less common
The germinative zones of the hair follicles are 
surrounded by T lymphocytes
Occasional associated diseases: hyperthyroidism, 
hypothyroidism, vitiligo, Down syndrome

If no evidence of hyperandrogenemia, 
then topical minoxidil; finasteridea; 
spironolactone (women); hair transplant; 
low-dose oral minoxidil

Topical anthralin or tazarotene; intralesional 
glucocorticoids; topical contact sensitizers; 
JAK inhibitors

Invasion of hairs by dermatophytes, most commonly 
Trichophyton tonsurans

Oral griseofulvin or terbinafine plus 2.5% 
selenium sulfide or ketoconazole shampoo; 
examine family members

Traction with curlers, rubber bands, tight braiding
Exposure to heat or chemicals (e.g., hair 
straighteners)
Mechanical pulling (trichotillomania)

Discontinuation of offending hair style 
or chemical treatments; diagnosis of 
trichotillomania may require observation of 
shaved hairs (for growth) or biopsy, possibly 
followed by psychotherapy

aTo date, Food and Drug Administration–approved for men. bScarring alopecia can occur at sites of kerions. cMay also be scarring, especially late-stage traction alopecia.

The  degree  of  pigment  formation  is  also  a  function  of  racial  back-
ground,  and  the  pigmentary  dilution  is  more  readily  apparent  when 
patients  are  compared  to  their  first-degree  relatives.  The  ocular 
findings  in  OCA  correlate  with  the  degree  of  hypopigmentation  and 
include  decreased  visual  acuity,  nystagmus,  photophobia,  strabismus, 
and a lack of normal binocular vision.

The  differential  diagnosis  of  localized  hypomelanosis  includes  the 
following primary cutaneous disorders: postinflammatory hypopigmen-
tation,  idiopathic  guttate  hypomelanosis,  pityriasis  (tinea)  versicolor, 
vitiligo,  chemical-  or  drug-induced  leukoderma,  nevus  depigmento-
sus  (see  below),  progressive  macular  hypomelanosis,  and  piebaldism  
(Table  58-10).  In  this  group  of  diseases,  the  areas  of  involvement 
are  macules  or  patches  with  a  decrease  or  absence  of  pigmentation. 
Patients with vitiligo also have an increased incidence of several auto-
immune disorders, including Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, 
pernicious anemia, Addison’s disease, uveitis, alopecia areata, chronic 
mucocutaneous candidiasis, and the autoimmune polyendocrine syn-
dromes  (types  I  and  II).  Diseases  of  the  thyroid  gland  are  the  most 
frequently  associated  disorders,  occurring  in  up  to  30%  of  patients 
with vitiligo. Circulating autoantibodies are often found, and the most 
common ones are antithyroglobulin, antimicrosomal, and antithyroid-
stimulating hormone receptor antibodies.

There  are  four  systemic  diseases  that  should  be  considered  in  a 
patient  with  skin  findings  suggestive  of  vitiligo—systemic  sclerosis, 
melanoma-associated  leukoderma,  onchocerciasis,  and  Vogt-Koyanagi- 
Harada syndrome. The vitiligo-like leukoderma seen in patients with

systemic sclerosis has a clinical resemblance to idiopathic vitiligo that 
has begun to repigment as a result of treatment; that is, perifollicular 
macules of normal pigmentation are seen within areas of depigmen-
tation. The basis of this leukoderma is unknown; there is no evidence 
of  inflammation  in  areas  of  involvement,  but  it  can  resolve  if  the 
underlying  connective  tissue  disease  becomes  inactive.  In  contrast 
to  idiopathic  vitiligo,  melanoma-associated  vitiligo-like  leukoderma 
often begins on the trunk, and its appearance, if spontaneous, should 
prompt a search for metastatic disease. It is also seen in patients under-
going immunotherapy for melanoma, including immune checkpoint- 
blocking antibodies, with cytotoxic T lymphocytes presumably recog-
nizing cell surface antigens common to melanoma cells and melano-
cytes, and is associated with a greater likelihood of a clinical response. 
A history of aseptic meningitis, nontraumatic uveitis, tinnitus, hearing 
loss, and/or dysacousia points to the diagnosis of the Vogt-Koyanagi- 
Harada  syndrome.  In  these  patients,  the  face  and  scalp  are  the  most 
common locations of pigment loss.

There  are  two  systemic  disorders  (neurocristopathies)  that  may 
have the cutaneous findings of piebaldism (Table 58-9). They are Shah- 
Waardenburg syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome. A possible expla-
nation  for  both  disorders  is  an  abnormal  embryonic  migration  or 
survival of two neural crest–derived elements, one of them being mela-
nocytes and the other myenteric ganglion cells (leading to Hirschsprung 
disease in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome) or auditory nerve cells (Waar-
denburg syndrome). The latter syndrome is characterized by congenital 
sensorineural  hearing  loss,  dystopia  canthorum  (lateral  displacement 
of the inner canthi but normal interpupillary distance), heterochromic 
irises, and a broad nasal root, in addition to the piebaldism. The facial

dysmorphism can be explained by the neural crest origin of the connec-
tive tissues of the head and neck. Patients with Waardenburg syndrome 
have been shown to have mutations in four genes, including PAX-3 and 
MITF, all of which encode transcription factors, whereas patients with 
Hirschsprung disease plus white spotting have mutations in one of three 
genes—endothelin 3, endothelin B receptor, and SOX-10.

In tuberous sclerosis, the earliest cutaneous sign is macular hypomel-
anosis, referred to as an ash leaf spot. These lesions are often present at 
birth and are usually multiple; however, detection may require Wood’s 
lamp examination, especially in lightly pigmented individuals. The pig-
ment within them is reduced, but not absent. The average size is 1–3 cm, 
and the common shapes are polygonal and lance-ovate. Examination of 
the patient for additional cutaneous signs such as multiple angiofibro-
mas of the face (adenoma sebaceum), ungual and intraoral fibromas, 
fibrous cephalic plaques, and connective tissue nevi (shagreen patches) 
is  recommended.  It  is  important  to  remember  that  an  ash  leaf  spot 
on the scalp will result in a circumscribed patch of lightly pigmented 
hair.  Internal  manifestations  include  seizures,  intellectual  disability, 
central  nervous  system  (CNS)  and  retinal  hamartomas,  pulmonary 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis  (women),  renal  angiomyolipomas,  and 
cardiac  rhabdomyomas.  The  latter  can  be  detected  in  up  to  60%  of 
children (<18 years) with tuberous sclerosis by echocardiography.

Nevus depigmentosus is a stable, well-circumscribed hypomelanosis 
that  is  present  at  birth.  There  is  usually  a  single  oval  or  rectangular

lesion, but when there are multiple lesions, the possibility of tuberous 
sclerosis needs to be considered. In linear nevoid hypopigmentation, a 
term that is replacing hypomelanosis of Ito and segmental or system-
atized  nevus  depigmentosus,  streaks  and  swirls  of  hypopigmentation 
are  observed.  Up  to  one-third  of  patients  in  a  tertiary  care  setting 
had  associated  abnormalities  involving  the  musculoskeletal  system 
(asymmetry),  the  CNS  (seizures  and  intellectual  disability),  and  the 
eyes  (strabismus  and  hypertelorism).  Chromosomal  mosaicism  has 

been detected in these patients, lending support to the hypothesis that 
the  cutaneous  pattern  is  the  result  of  the  migration  of  two  clones  of 
primordial melanocytes, each with a different pigment potential.

Localized  areas  of  decreased  pigmentation  are  commonly  seen 
as  a  result  of  cutaneous  inflammation  (Table  58-10)  and  have  been 
observed in the skin overlying active lesions of sarcoidosis (see “Papu-
lonodular Skin Lesions,” below) as well as in CTCL. Cutaneous infec-
tions also present as disorders of hypopigmentation, and in tuberculoid

leprosy, there are a few asymmetric patches of hypomelanosis that have 
associated  anesthesia,  anhidrosis,  and  alopecia.  Biopsy  specimens  of 
the palpable border show dermal granulomas that contain rare, if any, 
Mycobacterium leprae organisms.

HYPERPIGMENTATION
(Table  58-11)  Disorders  of  hyperpigmentation  are  also  divided  into 
two  major  groups—localized  and  diffuse.  The  localized  forms  are 
due  to  an  epidermal  alteration,  a  proliferation  of  melanocytes,  or  an 
increase in pigment production. Both acanthosis nigricans and sebor-
rheic keratoses belong to the first group. Acanthosis nigricans can be a 
reflection of an internal malignancy, most commonly of the gastroin-
testinal  tract,  and  it  appears  as  velvety  hyperpigmentation,  primarily 
in  flexural  areas.  However,  in  the  majority  of  patients,  acanthosis 
nigricans is associated with obesity and insulin resistance, although it 
may be a reflection of an endocrinopathy such as acromegaly, Cushing’s 
syndrome,  polycystic  ovary  syndrome,  or  insulin-resistant  diabetes 
mellitus  (type  A,  type  B,  and  lipodystrophic  forms).  Seborrheic  ker-
atoses are common lesions, but in one rare clinical setting, they are a 
sign of systemic disease, and that setting is the sudden appearance of 
multiple lesions, often with an inflammatory base and in association 
with acrochordons (skin tags) and acanthosis nigricans. This is termed 
the sign of Leser-Trélat and alerts the clinician to search for an internal 
malignancy.

A  proliferation  of  melanocytes  results  in  the  following  pigmented 
lesions:  lentigo,  melanocytic  nevus,  and  melanoma  (Chap.  76).  In  an 
adult,  the  majority  of  lentigines  are  related  to  sun  exposure,  which 
explains their distribution. However, in the Peutz-Jeghers and LEOPARD 
(lentigines;  ECG  abnormalities,  primarily  conduction  defects;  ocular 
hypertelorism;  pulmonary  stenosis  and  subaortic  valvular  stenosis; 
abnormal  genitalia  [cryptorchidism,  hypospadias];  retardation  of 
growth; and deafness [sensorineural]) syndromes, lentigines do serve 
as  a  clue  to  systemic  disease.  In  LEOPARD/Noonan  with  multiple 
lentigines syndrome, hundreds of lentigines develop during childhood 
and  are  scattered  over  the  entire  surface  of  the  body.  The  lentigines 
in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are located primarily around 
the nose and mouth, on the hands and feet, and within the oral cav-
ity. While the pigmented macules on the face may fade with age, the 
oral lesions persist. However, similar intraoral lesions are also seen in 
Addison’s  disease,  in  Laugier-Hunziker  syndrome  (no  internal  mani-
festations), and as a normal finding in darkly pigmented individuals. 
Patients with this autosomal dominant syndrome (due to mutations in 
a novel serine threonine kinase gene) have multiple benign polyps of 
the gastrointestinal tract, testicular or ovarian tumors, and an increased 
risk  of  developing  gastrointestinal  (primarily  colon)  and  pancreatic 
cancers.

In the Carney complex, numerous lentigines are also seen, but they 
are  in  association  with  cardiac  myxomas.  This  autosomal  dominant 
disorder  is  also  known  as  the  LAMB  (lentigines,  atrial  myxomas, 
mucocutaneous  myxomas,  and  blue  nevi)  syndrome  or  NAME  (nevi, 
atrial  myxoma,  myxoid  neurofibroma,  and  ephelides  [freckles])  syn-
drome. These patients can also have evidence of endocrine overactivity 
in the form of Cushing’s syndrome (pigmented nodular adrenocortical 
disease) and acromegaly.

The  third  type  of  localized  hyperpigmentation  is  due  to  a  local 
increase  in  pigment  production,  and  it  includes  ephelides  and  café 
au  lait  macules  (CALMs).  While  a  single  CALM  can  be  seen  in  up 
to  10%  of  the  normal  population,  the  presence  of  multiple  or  large-
sized  CALMs  raises  the  possibility  of  an  associated  genodermatosis, 
for example, neurofibromatosis (NF) or McCune-Albright syndrome. 
CALMs are flat, uniformly brown in color (usually two shades darker 
than  uninvolved  skin),  and  can  vary  in  size  from  0.5  to  12+  cm. 
More than 90% of adult patients with type I NF will have six or more 
CALMs  measuring  ≥1.5  cm  in  diameter.  Additional  findings  are 
discussed  in  the  section  on  neurofibromas  (see  “Papulonodular  Skin 
Lesions,” below). In comparison with NF, the CALMs in patients with 
McCune-Albright syndrome (polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with preco-
cious puberty in females due to mosaicism for an activating mutation

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesin  a  G  protein  [Gsα]  gene)  are  usually  larger,  are  more  irregular  in 
outline, and tend to respect the midline.

In  incontinentia  pigmenti,  dyskeratosis  congenita,  and  bleomy-
cin  pigmentation,  the  areas  of  localized  hyperpigmentation  form  a  
pattern—swirls and streaks in the first, reticulated in the second, and 
flagellate  in  the  third.  In  dyskeratosis  congenita,  atrophic  reticulated 
hyperpigmentation  is  seen  on  the  neck,  trunk,  and  thighs  and  is 
accompanied by nail dystrophy, pancytopenia, and leukoplakia of the 
oral  and  anal  mucosae.  The  latter  often  develops  into  squamous  cell 
carcinoma.  In  addition  to  the  flagellate  pigmentation  (linear  streaks) 
on the trunk, patients receiving bleomycin often have hyperpigmenta-
tion overlying the elbows, knees, and small joints of the hand.

Localized hyperpigmentation is seen as a side effect of several other 
systemic medications, including those that produce fixed drug reactions 
(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], sulfonamides, bar-
biturates, and tetracyclines) and those that can complex with melanin 
or iron (antimalarials and minocycline). Fixed drug eruptions recur in 
the exact same location as circular areas of erythema that can become 
bullous  and  then  resolve  as  brown  macules.  The  eruption  usually 
appears within hours of readministration of the offending agent, and 
common locations include the genitalia, distal extremities, and perioral 
region. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine produce gray-brown to 
blue-black discoloration of the shins, hard palate, and face, while blue 
macules  (often  misdiagnosed  as  bruises)  can  be  seen  on  the  lower 
extremities and in sites of inflammation with prolonged minocycline 
administration. Estrogen in oral contraceptives can induce melasma—
symmetric brown patches on the face, especially the cheeks, upper lip, 
and  forehead.  Similar  changes  are  seen  in  pregnancy  and  in  patients 
receiving phenytoin.

In the diffuse forms of hyperpigmentation, the darkening of the skin 
may be of equal intensity over the entire body or may be accentuated 
in  sun-exposed  areas.  The  causes  of  diffuse  hyperpigmentation  can 
be  divided  into  four  major  groups—endocrine,  metabolic,  autoim-
mune,  and  drugs.  The  endocrinopathies  that  frequently  have  associ-
ated  hyperpigmentation  include  Addison’s  disease,  Nelson’s  syndrome, 
and  ectopic  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH)  syndrome.  In  these 
diseases,  the  increased  pigmentation  is  diffuse  but  is  accentuated  in 
sun-exposed  areas,  as  well  as  in  the  palmar  creases,  sites  of  friction, 
and  scars.  An  overproduction  of  the  pituitary  hormones  α-MSH 
(melanocyte-stimulating hormone) and ACTH can lead to an increase 
in melanocyte activity. These peptides are products of the proopiome-
lanocortin gene and exhibit homology, for example, α-MSH and ACTH 
share 13 amino acids. A minority of patients with Cushing’s disease or 
hyperthyroidism have generalized hyperpigmentation.

The  metabolic  causes  of  hyperpigmentation  include  porphyria  
cutanea tarda (PCT), hemochromatosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid 
deficiency, pellagra, and malabsorption, including Whipple’s disease. In 
patients  with  PCT  (see  “Vesicles/Bullae,”  below),  the  skin  darkening 
is  seen  in  sun-exposed  areas  and  is  a  reflection  of  the  photoreactive 
properties  of  porphyrins.  The  increased  level  of  iron  in  the  skin  of 
patients  with  type  1  hemochromatosis  stimulates  melanin  pigment 
production and leads to the classic bronze color. Patients with pellagra 
have a brown discoloration of the skin, especially in sun-exposed areas, 
as a result of nicotinic acid (niacin) deficiency. In the areas of increased 
pigmentation,  there  is  a  thin,  varnish-like  scale.  These  changes  are 
also  seen  in  patients  who  are  vitamin  B6  deficient,  have  functioning 
carcinoid tumors (increased consumption of niacin), or take isoniazid. 
Approximately  50%  of  the  patients  with  Whipple’s  disease  have  an 
associated generalized hyperpigmentation in association with diarrhea, 
weight  loss,  arthritis,  and  lymphadenopathy.  A  diffuse,  slate-blue  to 
gray-brown color is seen in patients with melanosis secondary to meta-
static melanoma. The color reflects widespread deposition of melanin 
within the dermis as a result of the high concentration of circulating 
melanin precursors.

Of the autoimmune diseases associated with diffuse hyperpigmen-
tation,  primary  biliary  cholangitis  and  systemic  sclerosis  are  the  most 
common, and occasionally, both disorders are seen in the same patient. 
The  skin  is  dark  brown  in  color,  especially  in  sun-exposed  areas.  In 
primary biliary cholangitis, the hyperpigmentation is accompanied by 

pruritus, jaundice, and xanthomas, whereas in systemic sclerosis, it is 
accompanied by sclerosis of the extremities, face, and, less commonly, 
the  trunk.  Additional  clues  to  the  diagnosis  of  systemic  sclerosis  are 
mat  and  cuticular  telangiectasias,  calcinosis  cutis,  Raynaud’s  phe-
nomenon,  and  distal  ulcerations  (see  “Telangiectasias,”  above).  The 
differential  diagnosis  of  cutaneous  sclerosis  with  hyperpigmentation 
includes POEMS (polyneuropathy; organomegaly [liver, spleen, lymph 
nodes]; endocrinopathies [impotence, gynecomastia]; M-protein; and 
skin changes) syndrome. The skin changes include hyperpigmentation, 
induration, hypertrichosis, angiomas, clubbing, and facial lipoatrophy.
Diffuse hyperpigmentation that is due to drugs or metals can result 
from  one  of  several  mechanisms—induction  of  melanin  pigment 
formation,  complexing  of  the  drug  or  its  metabolites  to  melanin, 
and deposits of the drug in the dermis. Busulfan, cyclophosphamide, 
5-fluorouracil,  and  inorganic  arsenic  induce  pigment  production. 
Complexes containing melanin or iron plus the drug or its metabo-
lites are seen in patients receiving minocycline, and a diffuse, brown-
gray,  muddy  appearance  within  sun-exposed  areas  may  develop,  in 
addition  to  pigmentation  of  the  mucous  membranes,  teeth,  nails, 
bones, and thyroid. Administration of amiodarone can result in both 
a  phototoxic  eruption  (exaggerated  sunburn)  and/or  a  slate-gray  to 
violaceous  discoloration  of  sun-exposed  skin.  Biopsy  specimens  of 
the latter show yellow-brown granules in dermal macrophages, which 
represent  intralysosomal  accumulations  of  lipids,  amiodarone,  and 
its  metabolites.  Actual  deposits  of  a  particular  drug  or  metal  in  the 
skin are seen with silver (argyria), where the skin appears blue-gray 
in  color;  gold  (chrysiasis),  where  the  skin  has  a  brown  to  blue-gray 
color;  and  clofazimine,  where  the  skin  appears  reddish  brown.  The 
associated  pigmentation  is  accentuated  in  sun-exposed  areas,  and 
discoloration  of  the  eye  is  seen  with  gold  (sclerae)  and  clofazimine 
(conjunctivae).

to  as  vesicles  (<1  cm)  or  bullae  (>1  cm).  The  primary  autoimmune 
blistering  disorders  include  pemphigus  vulgaris,  pemphigus  foliaceus, 
paraneoplastic pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, gestational pemphigoid, 
cicatricial  pemphigoid,  epidermolysis  bullosa  acquisita,  linear  IgA  bul-
lous dermatosis (LABD), and dermatitis herpetiformis (Chap. 59).

Vesicles and bullae are also seen in contact dermatitis, both allergic 
and  irritant  forms  (Chap.  57).  When  there  is  a  linear  arrangement 
of  vesicular  lesions,  an  exogenous  cause  or  herpes  zoster  should  be 
suspected.  Bullous  disease  secondary  to  the  ingestion  of  drugs  can 
take  one  of  several  forms,  including  phototoxic  eruptions,  isolated 
bullae, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necroly-
sis  (TEN)  (Chap.  60).  Clinically,  phototoxic  eruptions  resemble  an 
exaggerated sunburn with diffuse erythema and bullae in sun-exposed 
areas. The most commonly associated drugs are doxycycline, quinolones, 
voriconazole,  thiazides,  NSAIDs,  vemurafenib,  and  psoralens.  The 
development  of  a  phototoxic  eruption  is  dependent  on  the  doses  of 
both the drug and ultraviolet (UV)-A irradiation.

Toxic  epidermal  necrolysis  is  characterized  by  bullae  that  arise  on 
widespread areas of tender erythema and then slough. This results in 
large areas of denuded skin. The associated morbidity, such as sepsis, 
and mortality rates are relatively high and are a function of the extent of 
epidermal necrosis. In addition, these patients may also have involve-
ment of the mucous membranes and respiratory and intestinal tracts. 
Drugs are the primary cause of TEN, and the most common offend-
ers  are  aromatic  anticonvulsants  (phenytoin,  barbiturates,  carbam-
azepine),  sulfonamides,  aminopenicillins,  allopurinol,  and  NSAIDs. 
Generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, severe acute graft-versus-host 
disease (grade 4), vancomycin-induced LABD, and flares of cutaneous 
lupus can also resemble TEN.

In  erythema  multiforme  (EM),  the  primary  lesions  are  pink-red 
macules  and  edematous  papules,  the  centers  of  which  may  become 
vesicular. In contrast to a morbilliform exanthem, the clue to the diag-
nosis of EM, and especially SJS, is the development of a “dusky” violet 
color in the center of the lesions. Target lesions are also characteristic 
of EM and arise as a result of active centers and borders in combination

with centrifugal spread. However, target lesions need not be present to 
make the diagnosis of EM.

EM  has  been  subdivided  into  two  major  groups:  (1)  EM  minor 
due  to  herpes  simplex  virus  (HSV);  and  (2)  EM  major  due  to  HSV, 
Mycoplasma pneumonia, or, occasionally, other viruses, Chlamydia, or 
drugs. Involvement of the mucous membranes (ocular, nasal, oral, and 
genital) is seen more commonly in the latter form, and in patients with 
Mycoplasma  pneumoniae-induced  rash  and  mucositis  (MIRM),  there 
may  be  minimal  cutaneous  involvement.  Hemorrhagic  crusts  of  the 
lips are characteristic of EM major and SJS as well as herpes simplex, 
pemphigus  vulgaris,  and  paraneoplastic  pemphigus.  Fever,  malaise, 
myalgias, sore throat, and cough may precede or accompany the erup-
tion.  The  lesions  of  EM  usually  resolve  over  2–4  weeks  but  may  be 
recurrent, especially when due to HSV. In addition to HSV (in which 
lesions usually appear 7–12 days after the viral eruption), EM can also 
follow vaccinations, radiation therapy, and exposure to environmental 
toxins, including the oleoresin in poison ivy.

Induction  of  SJS  is  most  often  due  to  drugs,  especially  sul-
fonamides,  aromatic  anticonvulsants,  lamotrigine,  aminopenicillins, 

and  nonnucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  (e.g.,  nevirapine). 
Widespread  dusky  macules  and  significant  mucosal  involvement  are 
characteristic of SJS, and the cutaneous lesions may or may not develop 
epidermal detachment. If the latter occurs, by definition, it is limited 
to <10% of the body surface area (BSA). Greater involvement leads to 
the diagnosis of SJS/TEN overlap (10–30% BSA) or TEN (>30% BSA).
In  addition  to  primary  blistering  disorders  and  hypersensitivity 
reactions, bacterial and viral infections can lead to vesicles and bullae. 
The most common infectious agents are HSV (Chap. 192), varicella- 
zoster virus (Chap. 193), and S. aureus (Chap. 147).

Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS) and bullous impetigo are 
two  blistering  disorders  associated  with  staphylococcal  (phage  group 
II)  infection.  In  SSSS,  the  initial  findings  are  redness  and  tenderness 
of the central face, neck, trunk, and intertriginous zones. This is fol-
lowed by short-lived flaccid bullae and a slough or exfoliation of the 
superficial  epidermis.  Crusted  areas  then  develop,  characteristically 
around the mouth in a radial pattern. SSSS is distinguished from TEN 
by  the  following  features:  younger  age  group  (primarily  infants  and 
toddlers),  more  superficial  site  of  blister  formation,  no  oral  lesions, 
shorter course, lower morbidity and mortality rates, and an association 
with staphylococcal exfoliative toxin (“exfoliatin”), not drugs. A rapid 
diagnosis of SSSS versus TEN can be made by a frozen section of the 
blister roof or exfoliative cytology of the blister contents. In SSSS, the 
site of staphylococcal infection is usually extracutaneous (conjunctivi-
tis, rhinorrhea, otitis media, pharyngitis, tonsillitis), and the cutaneous 
lesions  are  sterile,  whereas  in  bullous  impetigo,  the  skin  lesions  are 
the site of infection. Impetigo is more localized than SSSS and usually 
presents with honey-colored crusts. Occasionally, superficial purulent 
blisters  also  form.  Cutaneous  emboli  from  gram-negative  infections 
may  present  as  isolated  bullae,  but  the  base  of  the  lesion  is  purpuric 
or necrotic, and it may develop into an ulcer (see “Purpura,” below).

Several  metabolic  disorders  are  associated  with  blister  formation, 
including diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and porphyria. Local hypox-
emia secondary to decreased cutaneous blood flow can also produce 
blisters,  which  explains  the  presence  of  bullae  over  pressure  points 
in  comatose  patients  (coma  bullae).  In  diabetes  mellitus,  tense  bullae 
with clear sterile viscous fluid arise on normal skin. The lesions can be 
as large as 6 cm in diameter and are located on the distal extremities. 
There are several types of porphyria, but the most common form with 
cutaneous findings is porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). In sun-exposed 
areas (primarily the hands), the skin is very fragile, with trauma lead-
ing to erosions mixed with tense vesicles. These lesions then heal with 
scarring and formation of milia; the latter are firm, 1- to 2-mm white 
or yellow papules that represent epidermoid cysts. Associated findings 
can  include  hypertrichosis  of  the  lateral  malar  region  (men)  or  face 
(women) and, in sun-exposed areas, hyperpigmentation and firm scle-
rotic plaques. An elevated level of urinary uroporphyrins confirms the 
diagnosis and is due to a decrease in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase 
activity.  PCT  can  be  exacerbated  by  alcohol,  hemochromatosis  and 
other  forms  of  iron  overload,  chlorinated  hydrocarbons,  hepatitis  C 
virus and HIV infections, and hepatomas.

The differential diagnosis of PCT includes (1) porphyria variegata—
the skin signs of PCT plus the systemic findings of acute intermittent 
porphyria; it has a diagnostic plasma porphyrin fluorescence emission 
at 626 nm; (2) drug-induced pseudoporphyria—the clinical and histo-
logic findings are similar to PCT, but porphyrins are normal; etiologic 
agents include naproxen and other NSAIDs, furosemide, tetracycline, 
and  voriconazole;  (3)  bullous  dermatosis  of  hemodialysis—the  same 
appearance as PCT, but porphyrins are usually normal or occasionally 
borderline  elevated;  patients  have  chronic  renal  failure  and  are  on 
hemodialysis; (4) PCT associated with hepatomas and hemodialysis; and 
(5) epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (Chap. 59).

EXANTHEMS
(Table  58-13)  Exanthems  are  characterized  by  an  acute  generalized 
eruption. The most common presentation is erythematous macules and 
papules (morbilliform) and less often confluent blanching erythema (scar-
latiniform).  Morbilliform  eruptions  are  usually  due  to  either  drugs  or 
viral infections. For example, up to 5% of patients receiving penicillins,

sulfonamides,  phenytoin,  or  nevirapine  will  develop  a  maculopapular 
eruption. Accompanying signs may include pruritus, fever, eosinophilia, 
transaminitis,  and  transient  lymphadenopathy  (Chap.  60).  Similar 
maculopapular eruptions are seen in the classic childhood viral exan-
thems, including (1) rubeola (measles)—a prodrome of coryza, cough, 
and  conjunctivitis  followed  by  Koplik’s  spots  on  the  buccal  mucosa; 
the eruption begins behind the ears, at the hairline, and on the fore-
head and then spreads down the body, often becoming confluent; (2) 
rubella—the eruption begins on the forehead and face and then spreads 
down  the  body;  it  resolves  in  the  same  order  and  is  associated  with 
retroauricular  and  suboccipital  lymphadenopathy;  and  (3)  erythema 
infectiosum  (fifth  disease)—erythema  of  the  cheeks  is  followed  by  a 
reticulated pattern on the extremities; it is secondary to a parvovirus 
B19 infection, and an associated arthritis is seen in adults.

Both measles and rubella can occur in unvaccinated adults, and an 
atypical form of measles is seen in adults immunized with either killed 
measles vaccine or killed vaccine followed in time by live vaccine. In 
contrast to classic measles, the eruption of atypical measles begins on 
the palms, soles, wrists, and ankles, and the lesions may become pur-
puric. The patient with atypical measles can have pulmonary involve-
ment and be quite ill. Rubelliform and roseoliform eruptions are also 
associated  with  Epstein-Barr  virus  (5–15%  of  patients),  echovirus, 
coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and dengue, 
chikungunya, and West Nile virus infections. Detection of specific IgM 
antibodies  or  fourfold  elevations  in  IgG  antibodies  often  allows  the 
proper  diagnosis,  but  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  is  gradually 
replacing  serologic  assays.  Occasionally,  a  maculopapular  drug  erup-
tion is a reflection of an underlying viral infection. For example, ~95% 
of the patients with infectious mononucleosis who are given ampicillin 
will develop a rash.

Of note, early in the course of infections with Rickettsia and menin-
gococcus,  prior  to  the  development  of  petechiae  and  purpura,  the 
lesions may be erythematous macules and papules. This is also the case 
in  chickenpox  prior  to  the  development  of  vesicles.  Maculopapular 
eruptions are associated with early HIV infection, early secondary syph-
ilis, typhoid fever, and acute graft-versus-host disease. In the last, lesions 
frequently begin on the dorsal hands and forearms; the macular rose 
spots of typhoid fever involve primarily the anterior trunk.

The prototypic scarlatiniform eruption is seen in scarlet fever and is 
due  to  an  erythrogenic  toxin  produced  by  bacteriophage-containing 
group  A  β-hemolytic  streptococci,  most  commonly  in  the  setting  of 
pharyngitis. This eruption is characterized by diffuse erythema, which 
begins on the neck and upper trunk, and red follicular puncta. Addi-
tional findings include a white strawberry tongue (white coating with 
red papillae) followed by a red strawberry tongue (red tongue with red 
papillae); petechiae of the palate; a facial flush with circumoral pallor; 
linear  petechiae  in  the  antecubital  fossae;  and  desquamation  of  the 
involved skin, palms, and soles 5–20 days after onset of the eruption. 
A similar desquamation of the palms and soles is seen in toxic shock 
syndrome (TSS), in Kawasaki disease, and after severe febrile illnesses. 
Certain strains of staphylococci also produce an erythrotoxin that leads 
to the same clinical findings as in streptococcal scarlet fever, except that 
the anti-streptolysin O or DNase B titers are not elevated.

In toxic shock syndrome, staphylococcal (phage group I) infections 
produce  an  exotoxin  (TSST-1)  that  causes  the  fever  and  rash  as  well 
as enterotoxins. Initially, the majority of cases were reported in men-
struating  women  who  were  using  tampons.  However,  other  sites  of 
infection, including wounds and nasal packing, can lead to TSS. The 
diagnosis  of  TSS  is  based  on  clinical  criteria  (Chap.  147),  and  three 
of  these  involve  mucocutaneous  sites  (diffuse  erythema  of  the  skin, 
desquamation of the palms and soles 1–2 weeks after onset of illness, 
and involvement of the mucous membranes). The latter is character-
ized as hyperemia of the vagina, oropharynx, or conjunctivae. Similar 
systemic findings have been described in streptococcal toxic shock syn-
drome (Chap. 148), and although an exanthem is seen less often than 
in  TSS  due  to  a  staphylococcal  infection,  the  underlying  infection  is 
often in the soft tissue (e.g., cellulitis).

The  cutaneous  eruption  in  Kawasaki  disease  (Chap.  363)  is  poly-
morphous,  but  the  two  most  common  forms  are  morbilliform  and 
scarlatiniform.  Additional  mucocutaneous  findings  include  bilateral 
conjunctival injection; erythema and edema of the hands and feet fol-
lowed by desquamation; and diffuse erythema of the oropharynx, red 
strawberry tongue, and dry fissured lips. This clinical picture can resem-
ble TSS and scarlet fever, but clues to the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease 
are cervical lymphadenopathy, cheilitis, and thrombocytosis. The most 
serious  associated  systemic  finding  in  this  disease  is  coronary  aneu-
rysms secondary to arteritis. Seen primarily in children, SARS-CoV-2- 
associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome must be distinguished 
from  Kawasaki  disease.  Scarlatiniform  eruptions  are  also  seen  in  the 
early phase of SSSS (see “Vesicles/Bullae,” above), in young adults with 
Arcanobacterium haemolyticum infection, and as reactions to drugs.

URTICARIA
(Table  58-14)  Urticaria  (hives)  are  transient  lesions  that  are  com-
posed of a central wheal surrounded by an erythematous halo or flare. 
Individual  lesions  are  round,  oval,  or  figurate  and  are  often  pruritic. 
Acute and chronic urticarias have a wide variety of allergic etiologies

and reflect edema in the dermis. Urticarial lesions can also be seen in 
patients with mastocytosis (urticaria pigmentosa), hypo- or hyperthy-
roidism, Schnitzler’s syndrome, and systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (Still’s disease). In both juvenile- and adult-onset Still’s disease, 
the lesions coincide with the fever spike, are transient, and are due to 
dermal infiltrates of neutrophils; the latter is also referred to as neu-
trophilic urticarial dermatosis.

The  common  physical  urticarias  include  dermographism,  solar 
urticaria, cold urticaria, and cholinergic urticaria. Patients with dermo-
graphism exhibit linear wheals following minor pressure or scratching 
of  the  skin  and  may  be  a  contributing  factor  to  pruritic  dermatoses. 
It is a common disorder, affecting ~5% of the population. Solar urti-
caria characteristically occurs within minutes of sun exposure and is 
a skin sign of one systemic disease—erythropoietic protoporphyria. In 
addition to the urticaria, these patients have subtle pitted scarring of 
the nose and hands. Cold urticaria is precipitated by exposure to the 
cold,  and  therefore,  exposed  areas  are  usually  affected.  In  occasional 
patients, the disease is associated with abnormal circulating proteins—
more  commonly  cryoglobulins  and  less  commonly  cryofibrinogens. 
Additional  systemic  symptoms  include  wheezing  and  syncope,  thus 
explaining  the  need  for  these  patients  to  avoid  swimming  in  cold 
water.  Autosomal  dominantly  inherited  cold  urticaria  is  associated 
with dysfunction of cryopyrin. Cholinergic urticaria is precipitated by 
heat,  exercise,  or  emotion  and  is  characterized  by  small  wheals  with 
relatively large flares. It is occasionally associated with wheezing.

Whereas  urticarias  are  the  result  of  dermal  edema,  subcutaneous 
edema leads to the clinical picture of angioedema. Sites of involvement 
include  the  eyelids,  lips,  tongue,  larynx,  and  gastrointestinal  tract  as 
well as the subcutaneous tissue. Angioedema occurs alone or in com-
bination with urticaria, including urticarial vasculitis and the physical 
urticarias. Both acquired and hereditary (autosomal dominant) forms 
of angioedema occur (Chap. 354), and in the latter, urticaria is rarely, 
if ever, seen.

Urticarial  vasculitis  is  an  immune  complex  disease  that  may  be 
confused  with  simple  urticaria.  In  contrast  to  simple  urticaria,  indi-
vidual  lesions  tend  to  last  longer  than  24  h  and  usually  develop 
central petechiae that can be observed even after the urticarial phase 
has  resolved.  The  patient  may  also  complain  of  burning  rather  than 
pruritus. On biopsy, there is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the small 
dermal blood vessels. Although urticarial vasculitis may be idiopathic 
in origin, it can be a reflection of an underlying systemic illness such 
as lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, or hereditary complement 
deficiency. There is a spectrum of urticarial vasculitis that ranges from 
purely cutaneous to multisystem involvement. The most common sys-
temic  signs  and  symptoms  are  arthralgias  and/or  arthritis,  nephritis, 
and crampy abdominal pain, with asthma and chronic obstructive lung 
disease seen less often. Hypocomplementemia occurs in one- to two-
thirds of patients, even in the idiopathic cases. Urticarial vasculitis can 
also be seen in patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections and 
serum  sickness,  but  is  usually  not  seen  in  serum  sickness–like  illnesses 
(e.g., due to cefaclor, minocycline).

PAPULONODULAR SKIN LESIONS
(Table  58-15)  In  the  papulonodular  diseases,  the  lesions  are  elevated 
above the surface of the skin and may coalesce to form larger plaques. 
The location, consistency, and color of the lesions are the keys to their 
diagnosis; this section is organized on the basis of color.

 ■ WHITE LESIONS
In  calcinosis  cutis,  there  are  firm  white  to  white-yellow  papules  with 
an irregular surface. When the contents are expressed, a chalky white 
material  is  seen.  Dystrophic  calcification  is  seen  at  sites  of  previous 
inflammation or damage to the skin. It develops in acne scars as well 
as on the distal extremities of patients with systemic sclerosis and in 
the subcutaneous tissue and intermuscular fascial planes in DM. The 
latter  is  more  extensive  and  is  more  commonly  seen  in  children.  An 
elevated calcium phosphate product, most commonly due to secondary 
hyperparathyroidism  in  the  setting  of  renal  failure,  can  lead  to  nod-
ules of metastatic calcinosis cutis, which tend to be subcutaneous and

of individuals with a history of acne vulgaris, whereas plate-like lesions 
occur in rare genetic syndromes.

 ■ SKIN-COLORED LESIONS
There are several types of skin-colored lesions, including epidermoid 
cysts,  lipomas,  rheumatoid  nodules,  neurofibromas,  angiofibromas, 
neuromas,  and  adnexal  tumors  such  as  tricholemmomas.  Both  epi-
dermoid  cysts  and  lipomas  are  very  common  mobile  subcutaneous 
nodules—the former are rubbery and drain cheeselike material (sebum 
and keratin) if incised. Lipomas are firm and somewhat lobulated on 
palpation.  When  extensive  facial  epidermoid  cysts  develop  during 
childhood or there is a family history of such lesions, the patient should 
be  examined  for  other  signs  of  Gardner  syndrome,  including  osteo-
mas and desmoid tumors. Rheumatoid nodules are firm 0.5- to 4-cm 
nodules that favor the extensor aspect of joints, especially the elbows. 
They are seen in ~20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 6% 
of patients with Still’s disease. Biopsies of the nodules show palisading 
granulomas. Similar lesions that are smaller and shorter-lived are seen 
in rheumatic fever.

Neurofibromas  (benign  Schwann  cell  tumors)  are  soft  papules  or 
nodules that exhibit the “button-hole” sign; that is, they invaginate into 
the skin with pressure in a manner similar to a hernia. Single lesions 
are seen in normal individuals, but multiple neurofibromas, usually in 
combination with six or more CALMs measuring >1.5 cm (see “Hyper-
pigmentation,” above), axillary freckling, and multiple Lisch nodules, 
are  seen  in  von  Recklinghausen’s  disease  (NF  type  I)  (Chap.  90).  In 
some  patients,  the  neurofibromas  are  localized  and  unilateral  due  to 
somatic mosaicism.

Angiofibromas are firm pink-red to skin-colored papules that mea-
sure  from  3  mm  to  1.5  cm  in  diameter.  When  multiple  lesions  are 
located  on  the  central  cheeks  (adenoma  sebaceum),  the  patient  has 
tuberous sclerosis or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, 
type 1. The former is an autosomal disorder due to mutations in two 
different genes, and the associated findings are discussed in the section 
on ash leaf spots as well as in Chap. 90.

Neuromas  (benign  proliferations  of  nerve  fibers)  are  also  firm, 
skin-colored  papules.  They  are  more  commonly  found  at  sites  of 
amputations  and  in  rudimentary  polydactyly.  However,  when  there 
are multiple neuromas on the eyelids, lips, distal tongue, and/or oral 
mucosa,  the  patient  should  be  investigated  for  other  signs  of  MEN 
syndrome,  type  2b.  Associated  findings  include  marfanoid  habitus, 
protuberant  lips,  intestinal  ganglioneuromas,  and  medullary  thyroid 
carcinoma (>75% of patients; Chap. 388).

Adnexal tumors are derived from pluripotent cells of the epidermis 
that  can  differentiate  toward  hair,  sebaceous,  or  apocrine  or  eccrine 
glands,  or  remain  undifferentiated.  Basal  cell  carcinomas  (BCCs) 
are  examples  of  adnexal  tumors  that  have  little  or  no  evidence  of 
differentiation.  Clinically,  they  are  translucent  papules  with  rolled 
borders,  telangiectasias,  and  central  erosion.  BCCs  commonly  arise 
in sun-damaged skin of the head and neck as well as the upper trunk. 
When  a  patient  has  multiple  BCCs,  especially  prior  to  age  30,  the 
possibility  of  the  basal  cell  nevus  syndrome  should  be  raised.  It  is 
inherited  as  an  autosomal  dominant  trait  and  is  associated  with  jaw 
cysts, palmar and plantar pits, frontal bossing, medulloblastomas, and 
calcification of the falx cerebri and diaphragma sellae.  Tricholemmo-
mas are also skin-colored adnexal tumors but differentiate toward hair 
follicles and can have a wartlike appearance. The presence of multiple 
tricholemmomas  on  the  face  and  cobblestoning  of  the  oral  mucosa 
points  to  the  diagnosis  of  Cowden  disease  (multiple  hamartoma 
syndrome) due to mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog 
(PTEN)  gene.  Internal  organ  involvement  (in  decreasing  order  of 
frequency)  includes  fibrocystic  disease  and  carcinoma  of  the  breast, 
adenomas  and  carcinomas  of  the  thyroid,  and  gastrointestinal  poly-
posis. Keratoses of the palms, soles, and dorsal aspect of the hands are 
also seen. Fibrofolliculomas are skin-colored to white, smooth papules 
that favor the face, ears, and neck and, when multiple, are associated 

with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, which is associated with renal lesions 
including cancer (Chap. 85).

 ■ PINK LESIONS
The cutaneous lesions associated with primary systemic amyloidosis are 
often pink to pink-orange in color and translucent. Common locations 
are the face, especially the periorbital and perioral regions, and flexural 
areas.  On  biopsy,  homogeneous  deposits  of  amyloid  are  seen  in  the 
dermis and in the walls of blood vessels; the latter lead to an increase in 
vessel wall fragility. As a result, petechiae and purpura develop in clin-
ically normal skin as well as in lesional skin following minor trauma, 
hence the term pinch purpura. Amyloid deposits are also seen in the 
striated muscle of the tongue and result in macroglossia.

Even  though  specific  mucocutaneous  lesions  are  present  in  only 
~30% of the patients with primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis, the diag-
nosis can be made via histologic examination of abdominal subcutane-
ous fat, in conjunction with a serum free light chain assay. By special 
staining, amyloid deposits are seen around blood vessels or individual 
fat cells in 40–50% of patients. There are also three forms of amyloidosis 
that are limited to the skin and that should not be construed as cuta-
neous  lesions  of  systemic  amyloidosis.  They  are  macular  amyloidosis 
(upper  back),  lichen  amyloidosis  (usually  lower  extremities),  and 
nodular amyloidosis. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, the deposits 
are  composed  of  altered  epidermal  keratin.  Early-onset  macular  and 
lichen amyloidosis have been associated with MEN syndrome, type 2a.
Patients with multicentric reticulohistiocytosis also have pink-colored 
papules and nodules on the face and mucous membranes as well as on 
the extensor surface of the hands and forearms. They have a polyarthritis 
that  can  mimic  rheumatoid  arthritis  clinically.  On  histologic  exami-
nation, the papules have characteristic giant cells that are not seen in 
biopsies of rheumatoid nodules. Pink to skin-colored papules that are 
firm, 2–5 mm in diameter, and often in a linear arrangement are seen 
in patients with papular mucinosis. This disease is also referred to as 
scleromyxedema.  The  latter  name  comes  from  the  induration  of  the 
face and extremities that may accompany the papular eruption. Biopsy 
specimens of the papules show localized mucin deposition, and serum 
protein  electrophoresis  plus  immunofixation  electrophoresis  demon-
strates a monoclonal spike of IgG, usually with a λ light chain.

 ■ YELLOW LESIONS
Several  systemic  disorders  are  characterized  by  yellow-colored  cuta-
neous papules or plaques—hyperlipidemia (xanthomas), gout (tophi), 
diabetes (necrobiosis lipoidica), pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and Muir-
Torre syndrome (sebaceous tumors). Eruptive xanthomas are the most 
common  form  of  xanthomas  and  are  associated  with  hypertriglycer-
idemia  (primarily  hyperlipoproteinemia  types  I,  IV,  and  V).  Crops 
of  yellow  papules  with  erythematous  halos  occur  primarily  on  the 
extensor surfaces of the extremities and the buttocks, and they spon-
taneously involute with a fall in serum triglycerides. Types II and III 
result in one or more of the following types of xanthoma: xanthelasma, 
tendon xanthomas, and plane xanthomas. Xanthelasma are found on 
the eyelids, whereas tendon xanthomas are frequently associated with 
the Achilles and extensor finger tendons; plane xanthomas are flat and 
favor  the  palmar  creases  and  flexural  folds.  Tuberous  xanthomas  are 
frequently  associated  with  hypercholesterolemia;  however,  they  are 
also seen in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and are found most fre-
quently over the large joints or hand. Biopsy specimens of xanthomas 
show collections of lipid-containing macrophages (foam cells).

Patients with several disorders, including biliary cirrhosis, can have 
a secondary form of hyperlipidemia with associated tuberous and plane 
xanthomas. However, patients with plasma cell dyscrasias have normo-
lipemic plane xanthomas. This latter form of xanthoma may be ≥12 cm 
in diameter and is most frequently seen on the neck, upper trunk, and 
flexural folds. It is important to note that the most common setting for 
eruptive xanthomas is uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The least specific 
sign  for  hyperlipidemia  is  xanthelasma,  because  at  least  50%  of  the 
patients with this finding have normal lipid profiles.

In tophaceous gout, there are deposits of monosodium urate in the skin 
around  the  joints,  particularly  those  of  the  hands  and  feet.  Additional

sites of tophi formation include the helix of the ear and the olecranon and 
prepatellar bursae. The lesions are firm, yellow to yellow-white in color, 
and  occasionally  discharge  a  chalky  material.  Their  size  varies  from  
1 mm to 7 cm, and the diagnosis can be established by polarized light 
microscopy of the aspirated contents of a tophus. Lesions of necrobiosis 
lipoidica are found primarily on the shins (90%), and patients can have 
diabetes  mellitus  or  develop  it  subsequently.  Characteristic  findings 
include  a  central  yellow  color,  atrophy  (transparency),  telangiectasias, 
and a red to red-brown border. Ulcerations can also develop within the 
plaques. Biopsy specimens show necrobiosis of collagen and granulo-
matous inflammation.

In pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), due to mutations in the gene 
ABCC6, there is an abnormal deposition of calcium on the elastic fibers 
of the skin, eye, and blood vessels. In the skin, the flexural areas such 
as the neck, axillae, antecubital fossae, and inguinal area are the pri-
mary sites of involvement. Yellow papules coalesce to form reticulated 
plaques that have an appearance similar to that of plucked chicken skin. 
In  severely  affected  skin,  hanging,  redundant  folds  develop.  Biopsy 
specimens  of  involved  skin  show  swollen  and  irregularly  clumped 
elastic fibers with deposits of calcium. In the eye, the calcium deposits 
in  Bruch’s  membrane  lead  to  angioid  streaks  and  choroiditis;  in  the 
arteries of the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and extremities, the 
deposits  lead  to  angina,  hypertension,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  and 
claudication, respectively.

Adnexal  tumors  that  have  differentiated  toward  sebaceous  glands 
include  sebaceous  adenoma,  sebaceous  carcinoma,  and  sebaceous 
hyperplasia.  Except  for  sebaceous  hyperplasia,  which  is  commonly 
seen on the face, these tumors are fairly rare. Patients with Muir-Torre 
syndrome have one or more sebaceous adenoma(s), and they can also 
have sebaceous carcinomas and sebaceous hyperplasia as well as ker-
atoacanthomas.  The  internal  manifestations  of  Muir-Torre  syndrome 
include  multiple  carcinomas  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  (primarily 
colon) as well as cancers of the genitourinary tract.

 ■ RED LESIONS
Cutaneous lesions that are red in color have a wide variety of etiologies; 
in  an  attempt  to  simplify  their  identification,  they  will  be  subdivided 
into  papules,  papules/plaques,  and  subcutaneous  nodules.  Common 
red papules include arthropod bites and cherry hemangiomas; the latter 
are small, bright-red, dome-shaped papules that represent a benign pro-
liferation of capillaries. In patients with AIDS (Chap. 202), the devel-
opment  of  multiple  red  hemangioma-like  lesions  points  to  bacillary  
angiomatosis, and biopsy specimens show clusters of bacilli that stain 
positively with the Warthin-Starry stain; the pathogens have been iden-
tified  as  Bartonella  henselae  and  Bartonella  quintana.  Disseminated 
visceral  disease  is  seen  primarily  in  immunocompromised  hosts  but 
can occur in immunocompetent individuals.

Multiple  angiokeratomas  are  seen  in  Fabry  disease,  an  X-linked 
recessive  lysosomal  storage  disease  that  is  due  to  a  deficiency  of  
α-galactosidase A. The lesions are red to red-purple in color and can 
be quite small in size (1–3 mm), with the most common location being 
the  lower  trunk.  Associated  findings  include  chronic  renal  disease, 
peripheral  neuropathy,  and  corneal  opacities  (cornea  verticillata). 
While  electron  photomicrographs  demonstrate  lamellar  lipid  depos-
its  in  dermal  fibroblasts,  pericytes,  and  endothelial  cells,  nowadays, 
genetic  analysis  is  more  frequently  performed  for  diagnosis.  Wide-
spread  acute  eruptions  of  erythematous  papules  are  discussed  in  the 
section on exanthems.

There  are  several  infectious  diseases  that  present  as  erythematous 
papules or nodules in a lymphocutaneous or sporotrichoid pattern, that 
is, in a linear arrangement along the lymphatic channels. The two most 
common  etiologies  are  Sporothrix  schenckii  (sporotrichosis)  and  the 
atypical mycobacterium Mycobacterium marinum. The organisms are 
introduced as a result of trauma, and a primary inoculation site is often 
seen  in  addition  to  the  lymphatic  nodules.  Additional  causes  include 
Nocardia, Leishmania, and other atypical mycobacteria and dimorphic 
fungi; culture or PCR of lesional tissue will aid in the diagnosis.

The  diseases  that  are  characterized  by  erythematous  plaques  with 
scale  are  reviewed  in  the  papulosquamous  section,  and  the  various 

forms  of  dermatitis  are  discussed  in  the  section  on  erythroderma. 
Additional  disorders  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of  red  papules/
plaques  include  cellulitis,  polymorphous  light  eruption  (PMLE),  cuta-
neous  lymphoid  hyperplasia  (lymphocytoma  cutis),  cutaneous  lupus, 
lymphoma cutis, and leukemia cutis. The first three diseases represent 
primary cutaneous disorders, although cellulitis may be accompanied 
by a bacteremia. PMLE is characterized by erythematous papules and 
plaques in a primarily sun-exposed distribution—dorsum of the hand, 
extensor forearm, and upper trunk. Lesions follow exposure to UV-B 
and/or UV-A, and in higher latitudes, PMLE is most severe in the late 
spring and early summer. A process referred to as “hardening” occurs 
with continued UV exposure, and the eruption fades, but in temperate 
climates, it recurs the next spring. PMLE must be differentiated from 
cutaneous lupus, and this is accomplished by observation of the natural 
history,  histologic  examination,  and  sometimes  direct  immunofluo-
rescence of the lesions. Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (pseudolym-
phoma) is a benign polyclonal proliferation of lymphocytes within the 
skin  that  presents  as  infiltrated  pink-red  to  red-purple  papules  and 
plaques; it must be distinguished from lymphoma cutis.

Several types of red plaques are seen in patients with systemic lupus, 
including  (1)  erythematous  urticarial  plaques  across  the  cheeks  and 
nose  in  the  classic  butterfly  rash;  (2)  erythematous  discoid  lesions 
with  fine  or  “carpet-tack”  scale,  telangiectasias,  central  hypopigmen-
tation, peripheral hyperpigmentation, follicular plugging, and atrophy 
located  on  the  scalp,  face,  external  ears,  arms,  and  upper  trunk;  and 
(3) psoriasiform or annular lesions of subacute cutaneous lupus with 
hypopigmented  centers  located  primarily  on  the  extensor  arms  and 
upper  trunk.  Additional  mucocutaneous  findings  include  (1)  a  vio-
laceous flush on the face and V of the neck; (2) photosensitivity; (3) 
urticarial vasculitis (see “Urticaria,” above); (4) lupus panniculitis (see 
below); (5) diffuse alopecia; (6) alopecia secondary to discoid lesions; 
(7) nailfold telangiectasias and erythema; (8) EM- or TEN-like lesions 
that may become bullous; (9) oral or nasal ulcers; (10) livedo reticu-
laris; and (11) distal ulcerations secondary to Raynaud’s phenomenon, 
vasculitis, or livedoid vasculopathy. Patients with only discoid lesions 
usually have the form of lupus that is limited to the skin. However, up 
to 10–15% of these patients eventually develop systemic lupus. Direct 
immunofluorescence  of  involved  skin,  in  particular  discoid  lesions, 
shows deposits of IgG or IgM and C3 in a granular distribution along 
the dermal-epidermal junction.

In lymphoma cutis, there is a clonal proliferation of malignant lym-
phocytes within the skin, and the clinical appearance resembles that of 
cutaneous  lymphoid  hyperplasia—infiltrated  pink-red  to  red-purple 
papules  and  plaques.  Lymphoma  cutis  can  occur  anywhere  on  the 
surface  of  the  skin,  whereas  the  sites  of  predilection  for  lymphocy-
tomas include the malar ridge, tip of the nose, and earlobes. Patients 
with non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas have specific cutaneous lesions more 
often than those with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and, occasionally, the skin 
nodules  precede  the  development  of  extracutaneous  non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma  or  represent  the  only  site  of  involvement  (e.g.,  primary 
cutaneous  B-cell  lymphoma).  Arcuate  lesions  are  sometimes  seen 
in  lymphoma  and  lymphocytoma  cutis  as  well  as  in  CTCL.  Adult 
T-cell  leukemia/lymphoma  that  develops  in  association  with  HTLV-1 
infection  is  characterized  by  cutaneous  plaques,  hypercalcemia,  and 
circulating CD25+ lymphocytes. Leukemia cutis has the same appear-
ance as lymphoma cutis, and specific lesions are seen more commonly 
in  monocytic  leukemias  than  in  lymphocytic  or  granulocytic  leuke-
mias. Cutaneous chloromas (granulocytic sarcomas) may precede the 
appearance of circulating blasts in acute myelogenous leukemia and, as 
such, represent a form of aleukemic leukemia cutis.

Sweet syndrome is characterized by pink-red to red-brown edematous 
plaques  that  are  frequently  painful  and  occur  primarily  on  the  head, 
neck, and upper extremities. The patients also have fever, neutrophilia, 
and  a  dense  dermal  infiltrate  of  neutrophils  in  the  lesions.  In  ~10% 
of  the  patients,  there  is  an  associated  malignancy,  most  commonly 
acute myelogenous leukemia. Sweet syndrome has also been reported 
with inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and 
solid  tumors  (primarily  of  the  genitourinary  tract)  as  well  as  drugs 
(e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], hypomethylating

agents, all-trans-retinoic acid). The differential diagnosis includes neu-
trophilic  eccrine  hidradenitis;  bullous  forms  of  pyoderma  gangreno-
sum; and, occasionally, cellulitis. Extracutaneous sites of involvement 
include  joints,  muscles,  eyes,  kidneys  (proteinuria,  occasionally  glo-
merulonephritis),  and  lungs  (neutrophilic  infiltrates).  The  idiopathic 
form  of  Sweet  syndrome  is  seen  more  often  in  women,  following  a 
respiratory tract infection.

Common  causes  of  erythematous  subcutaneous  nodules  include 
inflamed  epidermoid  cysts,  acne  cysts,  and  furuncles.  Panniculitis,  an 
inflammation  of  the  fat,  also  presents  as  subcutaneous  nodules  and  is 
frequently a sign of systemic disease. There are several forms of pannicu-
litis, including erythema nodosum, erythema induratum/nodular vascu-
litis, lupus panniculitis, lipodermatosclerosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, 
factitial,  and  fat  necrosis  secondary  to  pancreatic  disease.  Except  for 
erythema nodosum, these lesions may break down and ulcerate or heal 
with a scar. The shin is the most common location for the nodules of 
erythema nodosum, whereas the calf is the most common location for 
lesions of erythema induratum. In erythema nodosum, the nodules are 
initially  red  but  then  develop  a  blue  bruise-like  color  as  they  resolve. 
Patients with erythema nodosum but no underlying systemic illness can 
still have fever, malaise, leukocytosis, arthralgias, and/or arthritis. How-
ever, the possibility of an underlying illness should be excluded, and the 
most common associations are streptococcal infections, upper respira-
tory  viral  infections,  sarcoidosis,  and  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  in 
addition to drugs (oral contraceptives, sulfonamides, penicillins, bro-
mides,  iodides,  BRAF  inhibitors).  Less  common  associations  include 
bacterial gastroenteritis (Yersinia, Salmonella) and coccidioidomycosis 
followed  by  tuberculosis,  histoplasmosis,  brucellosis,  and  infections 
with  Chlamydia  pneumoniae,  Chlamydia  trachomatis,  Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae, or hepatitis B virus.

Erythema  induratum  and  nodular  vasculitis  have  overlapping 
features  clinically  and  histologically,  and  whether  they  represent  two 
separate  entities  or  the  ends  of  a  single  disease  spectrum  is  a  point 
of debate; in general, the latter is usually idiopathic and the former is 
associated  with  the  presence  of  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  DNA  by 
PCR  within  skin  lesions.  The  lesions  of  lupus  panniculitis  are  found 
primarily on the cheeks, upper arms, and buttocks (sites of abundant 
fat) and are seen in both the cutaneous and systemic forms of lupus. 
The overlying skin may be normal, erythematous, or have the changes 
of discoid lupus. The subcutaneous fat necrosis that is associated with 
pancreatic disease is presumably secondary to circulating lipases and 
is  seen  in  patients  with  pancreatic  carcinoma  as  well  as  in  patients 
with acute and chronic pancreatitis. In this disorder, there may be an 
associated arthritis, fever, and inflammation of visceral fat. Histologic 
examination of deep incisional biopsy specimens will aid in the diag-
nosis of the particular type of panniculitis.

Subcutaneous  erythematous  nodules  are  also  seen  in  cutaneous 
polyarteritis nodosa and as a manifestation of systemic vasculitis when 
there  is  involvement  of  medium-sized  vessels,  for  example,  systemic 
polyarteritis nodosa, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Chap. 363). Cutaneous polyarteritis 
nodosa presents with painful subcutaneous nodules and ulcers within 
a red-purple, netlike pattern of livedo reticularis. The latter is due to 
slowed  blood  flow  through  the  superficial  horizontal  venous  plexus. 
The majority of lesions are found on the lower extremities, and while 
arthralgias  and  myalgias  may  accompany  cutaneous  polyarteritis 
nodosa, there is no evidence of systemic involvement. In both the cuta-
neous and systemic forms of vasculitis, skin biopsy specimens of the 
associated nodules will show the changes characteristic of a necrotizing 
vasculitis and/or granulomatous inflammation.

the dermis, that is, granulomas surrounded by a minimal number of 
lymphocytes. Other cutaneous findings in sarcoidosis include annular 
lesions with an atrophic or scaly center, papules within scars, hypopig-
mented papules and patches, subcutaneous plaques, alopecia, acquired 
ichthyosis, erythema nodosum, and lupus pernio (see below).

The differential diagnosis of sarcoidosis includes foreign-body gran-
ulomas produced by chemicals such as beryllium and zirconium, late 
secondary syphilis, and lupus vulgaris. Lupus vulgaris is a form of cuta-
neous  tuberculosis  that  is  seen  in  previously  infected  and  sensitized 
individuals.  There  is  often  underlying  active  tuberculosis  elsewhere, 
usually  in  the  lungs  or  lymph  nodes.  Lesions  occur  primarily  in  the 
head and neck region and are red-brown plaques with a yellow-brown 
color on diascopy. Secondary scarring can develop within the central 
portion of the plaques. Cultures or PCR analysis of the lesions should 
be  performed,  along  with  an  interferon  γ  release  assay  of  peripheral 
blood, because it is rare for the acid-fast stain to show bacilli within 
the dermal granulomas.

A  generalized  distribution  of  red-brown  macules  and  papules 
is  seen  in  the  form  of  mastocytosis  known  as  urticaria  pigmentosa  
(Chap.  354).  Each  lesion  represents  a  collection  of  mast  cells  in  the 
dermis,  with  hyperpigmentation  of  the  overlying  epidermis.  Stimuli 
such as rubbing cause these mast cells to degranulate, and this leads to 
the formation of localized urticaria (Darier’s sign). Additional symp-
toms  can  result  from  mast  cell  degranulation  and  include  headache, 
flushing, diarrhea, and pruritus. Mast cells also infiltrate various organs 
such as the liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract, and accumulations 
of mast cells in the bones may produce either osteosclerotic or osteo-
lytic lesions on radiographs. In the majority of these patients, however, 
the  internal  involvement  remains  indolent.  A  subtype  of  chronic 
cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, erythema elevatum diutinum (EED), 
also  presents  with  papules  that  are  red-brown  in  color.  The  papules 
coalesce  into  plaques  on  the  extensor  surfaces  of  knees,  elbows,  and 
the small joints of the hand. Flares of EED have been associated with 
streptococcal infections.

 ■ BLUE LESIONS
Lesions that are blue in color are the result of vascular ectasias, hyper-
plasias,  and  tumors  or  melanin  pigment  within  the  dermis.  Venous 
lakes  (ectasias)  are  compressible  dark-blue  lesions  that  are  found 
commonly in the head and neck region. Venous malformations are also 
compressible blue papulonodules and plaques that can occur anywhere 
on the body, including the oral mucosa. When there are multiple pap-
ulonodules rather than a single congenital lesion, the patient may have 
the blue rubber bleb syndrome or Maffucci’s syndrome. Patients with 
the  blue  rubber  bleb  syndrome  also  have  vascular  anomalies  of  the 
gastrointestinal tract that may bleed, whereas patients with Maffucci’s 
syndrome  have  associated  osteochondromas.  Blue  nevi  (moles)  are 
seen  when  there  are  collections  of  pigment-producing  nevus  cells  in 
the dermis. These benign papular lesions are dome-shaped and occur 
most commonly on the dorsum of the hand or foot or in the head and 
neck region.

 ■ VIOLACEOUS LESIONS
Violaceous papules and plaques are seen in lupus pernio, lymphoma cutis, 
and cutaneous lupus. Lupus pernio is a particular type of sarcoidosis that 
involves the tip and alar rim of the nose as well as the earlobes, with 
lesions that are violaceous in color rather than red-brown. This form 
of sarcoidosis is associated with involvement of the upper respiratory 
tract. The plaques of lymphoma cutis and cutaneous lupus may be red 
or violaceous in color and were discussed above.

 ■ RED-BROWN LESIONS
The cutaneous lesions in sarcoidosis (Chap. 367) are classically red to 
red-brown  in  color,  and  with  diascopy  (pressure  with  a  glass  slide), 
a  yellow-brown  residual  color  is  observed  that  is  secondary  to  the 
granulomatous infiltrate. The waxy papules and plaques may be found 
anywhere on the skin, but the face is the most common location. Usu-
ally there are no surface changes, but occasionally, the lesions will have 
scale.  Biopsy  specimens  of  the  papules  show  “naked”  granulomas  in 

 ■ PURPLE LESIONS
Purple-colored papules and plaques are seen in vascular tumors, such 
as  Kaposi’s  sarcoma  (Chap.  202)  and  angiosarcoma,  and  when  there 
is  extravasation  of  red  blood  cells  into  the  skin  in  association  with 
inflammation, as in palpable purpura (see “Purpura,” below). Patients 
with congenital or acquired AV fistulas and venous hypertension can 
develop  purple  papules  on  the  lower  extremities  that  can  resemble 
Kaposi’s sarcoma clinically and histologically; this condition is referred

to as pseudo-Kaposi’s sarcoma (acral angiodermatitis). Angiosarcoma 
is found most commonly on the scalp and face of elderly patients or 
within  areas  of  chronic  lymphedema  and  presents  as  purple  papules 
and  plaques.  In  the  head  and  neck  region,  the  tumor  often  extends 
beyond  the  clinically  defined  borders  and  may  be  accompanied  by 
facial edema.

 ■ BROWN AND BLACK LESIONS
Brown-  and  black-colored  papules  are  reviewed  in  “Hyperpigmenta-
tion,” above.

 ■ CUTANEOUS METASTASES
These are discussed last because they can have a wide range of colors. 
Most  commonly,  they  present  as  either  firm,  skin-colored  subcuta-
neous  nodules  or  firm,  red  to  red-brown  papulonodules,  whereas 
metastatic melanoma can be pink, blue, or black in color. Cutaneous 
metastases  develop  from  hematogenous  or  lymphatic  spread  and  are 
most  often  due  to  the  following  primary  carcinomas:  in  men,  mela-
noma, oropharynx, lung, and colon; and in women, breast, melanoma, 
and ovary. These metastatic lesions may be the initial presentation of 
the carcinoma, especially when the primary site is the lung.

PURPURA
(Table 58-16) Purpura are seen when there is an extravasation of red 
blood cells into the dermis and, as a result, the lesions do not blanch 
with  pressure.  This  is  in  contrast  to  those  erythematous  or  violet- 
colored lesions that are due to localized vasodilatation—they do blanch 
with pressure. Purpura (≥3 mm) and petechiae (≤2 mm) are divided 
into two major groups: palpable and nonpalpable. The most frequent 
causes  of  nonpalpable  purpura  and  petechiae  are  primary  cutaneous 
disorders  such  as  trauma,  solar  (actinic)  purpura,  stasis  purpura,  and 
capillaritis. Less common causes are steroid purpura and livedoid vas-
culopathy  (see  “Ulcers,”  below).  Solar  purpura  are  seen  primarily  on 
the  extensor  forearms,  whereas  steroid  purpura  secondary  to  potent 
topical  glucocorticoids  or  endogenous  or  exogenous  Cushing’s  syn-
drome can be more widespread. In both cases, there is alteration of the 
supporting connective tissue that surrounds the dermal blood vessels. 
In  contrast,  the  petechiae  that  result  from  capillaritis  are  found  pri-
marily on the lower extremities. In capillaritis, there is an extravasation 
of erythrocytes as a result of perivascular lymphocytic inflammation. 
The  petechiae  are  bright  red,  1–2  mm  in  size,  and  scattered  within  
yellow-brown patches. The yellow-brown color is caused by hemosid-
erin deposits within the dermis.

Systemic causes of nonpalpable purpura fall into several categories, 
and  those  secondary  to  clotting  disturbances  and  vascular  fragility 
will  be  discussed  first.  The  former  group  includes  thrombocytopenia  
(Chap. 115), abnormal platelet function as is seen in uremia, and clot-
ting factor defects. The initial site of presentation for thrombocytopenia- 
induced petechiae is the distal lower extremity. Capillary fragility leads 
to  nonpalpable  purpura  in  patients  with  systemic  amyloidosis  (see 
“Papulonodular  Skin  Lesions,”  above),  disorders  of  collagen  produc-
tion such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and scurvy. In scurvy, there are 
flattened corkscrew hairs with surrounding hemorrhage on the lower 
extremities, in addition to gingivitis. Vitamin C is a cofactor for lysyl 
hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in the posttranslational modification 
of procollagen that is necessary for cross-link formation.

In contrast to the previous group of disorders, the noninflammatory 
purpura  seen  in  the  following  group  of  diseases  are  associated  with 
thrombi formation within vessels and have a retiform configuration. It 
is important to note that these thrombi are demonstrable in skin biopsy 
specimens. This group of disorders includes disseminated intravascu-
lar coagulation (DIC), monoclonal cryoglobulinemia, thrombocytosis, 
thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura,  antiphospholipid  antibody 
syndrome,  and  reactions  to  warfarin  and  heparin  (heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia and thrombosis). DIC is triggered by several types 
of  infection  (gram-negative,  gram-positive,  viral,  and  rickettsial)  as 
well as by tissue injury and neoplasms. Widespread purpura and hem-
orrhagic infarcts of the distal extremities are seen. Similar lesions are 
found in purpura fulminans, which is a form of DIC associated with

fever  and  hypotension  that  occurs  more  commonly  in  children  fol-
lowing an infectious illness such as varicella, scarlet fever, or an upper 
respiratory tract infection. In both disorders, hemorrhagic bullae can 
develop in involved skin.

Monoclonal cryoglobulinemia is associated with plasma cell dyscra-
sias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoma. Purpura, primar-
ily  of  the  lower  extremities,  and  hemorrhagic  infarcts  of  the  fingers, 
toes, nose and ears are seen in these patients. Exacerbations of disease 
activity  can  follow  cold  exposure  or  an  increase  in  serum  viscosity. 
Biopsy specimens show precipitates of the cryoglobulin within dermal 
vessels. Similar deposits have been found in the lung, brain, and renal 
glomeruli.  Patients  with  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  can 
also have hemorrhagic infarcts as a result of intravascular thromboses.

Additional signs include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and fluc-
tuating neurologic abnormalities, especially headaches and confusion.
Administration of warfarin can result in painful areas of erythema 
that become purpuric and then necrotic with an adherent black eschar; 
the condition is also referred to as Coumadin-induced necrosis. This 
reaction  is  seen  more  often  in  women  and  in  areas  with  abundant 
subcutaneous fat—breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, and calves. The 
erythema  and  purpura  develop  between  the  third  and  tenth  day  of 
therapy, most likely as a result of a transient imbalance in the levels of 
anticoagulant  and  procoagulant  vitamin  K–dependent  factors.  Con-
tinued  therapy  does  not  exacerbate  preexisting  lesions,  and  patients 
with an inherited or acquired deficiency of protein C are at increased 
risk for this particular reaction as well as for purpura fulminans and 
calciphylaxis.

Purpura  secondary  to  cholesterol  emboli  are  usually  seen  on  the 
lower  extremities  of  patients  with  atherosclerotic  vascular  disease. 
They often follow anticoagulant therapy or an invasive vascular proce-
dure such as an arteriogram but also occur spontaneously from disin-
tegration of atheromatous plaques. Associated findings include livedo 
reticularis, gangrene, cyanosis, and ischemic ulcerations. Multiple step 
sections of the biopsy specimen may be necessary to demonstrate the 
cholesterol  clefts  within  the  vessels.  Petechiae  are  also  an  important 
sign of fat embolism and occur primarily on the upper body 2–3 days 
after  a  major  injury.  By  using  special  fixatives,  the  emboli  can  be 
demonstrated  in  biopsy  specimens  of  the  petechiae.  Rarely,  emboli 
of  tumor  or  thrombus  are  seen  in  patients  with  atrial  myxomas  and 
marantic endocarditis.

In  the  Gardner-Diamond  syndrome  (autoerythrocyte  sensitivity), 
female patients develop large ecchymoses within areas of painful, warm 
erythema.  Intradermal  injections  of  autologous  erythrocytes  or  phos-
phatidyl serine derived from the red cell membrane can reproduce the 
lesions in some patients; however, there are instances where a reaction 
is seen at an injection site of the forearm but not in the midback region. 
The latter has led some observers to view Gardner-Diamond syndrome 
as a cutaneous manifestation of severe emotional stress. More recently, 
the possibility of platelet dysfunction (as assessed via aggregation studies) 
has  been  raised.  Waldenström’s  hypergammaglobulinemic  purpura  is 
a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent crops of petechiae and 
larger purpuric macules on the lower extremities. There are circulating 
complexes  of  IgG–anti-IgG  molecules,  and  exacerbations  are  associ-
ated with prolonged standing or walking. Patients may have an under-
lying autoimmune connective tissue disease, e.g., Sjögren’s syndrome.

Palpable purpura are further subdivided into vasculitic and embolic. 
In  the  group  of  vasculitic  disorders,  cutaneous  small-vessel  vasculi-
tis,  also  known  as  leukocytoclastic  vasculitis  (LCV),  is  the  one  most 
commonly associated with palpable purpura (Chap. 363). Underlying 
etiologies include drugs (e.g., antibiotics), infections (e.g., hepatitis C 
virus),  and  autoimmune  connective  tissue  diseases  (e.g.,  rheumatoid 
arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, lupus). Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) 
is a subtype of acute LCV that is seen more commonly in children and 
adolescents  following  an  upper  respiratory  infection.  The  majority 
of  lesions  are  found  on  the  lower  extremities  and  buttocks.  Systemic 
manifestations  include  fever,  arthralgias  (primarily  of  the  knees  and 
ankles),  abdominal  pain,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  and  nephritis. 
Direct immunofluorescence examination shows deposits of IgA within 
dermal  blood  vessel  walls.  Renal  disease  is  of  particular  concern  in 
adults with IgA vasculitis.

Several types of infectious emboli can give rise to palpable purpura. 
These  embolic  lesions  are  usually  irregular  in  outline  as  opposed  to 
the lesions of LCV, which are circular in outline. The irregular outline 
is  indicative  of  a  cutaneous  infarct,  and  the  size  corresponds  to  the 
area  of  skin  that  received  its  blood  supply  from  that  particular  arte-
riole or artery. The palpable purpura in LCV are circular because the  
erythrocytes simply diffuse out evenly from the postcapillary venules 
as a result of inflammation. Infectious emboli are most commonly due 
to  gram-negative  cocci  (meningococcus,  gonococcus),  gram-negative 
rods  (Enterobacteriaceae),  and  gram-positive  cocci  (Staphylococcus). 
Additional  causes  include  Rickettsia  and,  in  immunocompromised 
patients, Aspergillus and other opportunistic fungi.

The embolic lesions in acute meningococcemia are found primarily 
on the trunk, lower extremities, and sites of pressure, and a gunmetal- 
gray  color  often  develops  within  them.  Their  size  varies  from  a  few 
millimeters to several centimeters, and the organisms can be cultured 
from the lesions. Associated findings include a preceding upper respi-
ratory tract infection; fever; meningitis; DIC; and, in some patients, a 
deficiency of the terminal components of complement. In disseminated 
gonococcal infection (arthritis-dermatitis syndrome), a small number of 
inflammatory papules and vesicopustules, often with central purpura 
or  hemorrhagic  necrosis,  are  found  on  the  distal  extremities.  Addi-
tional symptoms include arthralgias, tenosynovitis, and fever. To estab-
lish the diagnosis, a Gram stain of these lesions should be performed. 
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne disease that is caused by 
Rickettsia rickettsii. A several-day history of fever, chills, severe head-
ache, and photophobia precedes the onset of the cutaneous eruption. 
The initial lesions are erythematous macules and papules on the wrists, 
ankles, palms, and soles. With time, the lesions spread centripetally and 
become purpuric.

Lesions of ecthyma gangrenosum begin as edematous, erythematous 
papules  or  plaques  and  then  develop  central  purpura  and  necrosis. 
Bullae formation also occurs in these lesions, and they are frequently 
found in the girdle region. The organism that is classically associated 
with  ecthyma  gangrenosum  is  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa,  but  other 
gram-negative  rods  such  as  Klebsiella,  Escherichia  coli,  and  Serratia 
can produce similar lesions. In immunocompromised hosts, the list of 
potential pathogens is expanded to include Candida and other oppor-
tunistic fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Fusarium).

ULCERS
The  approach  to  the  patient  with  a  cutaneous  ulcer  is  outlined  in  
Table  58-17.  Peripheral  vascular  diseases  of  the  extremities  are 
reviewed in Chap. 281, as is Raynaud’s phenomenon.

Livedoid  vasculopathy  (livedoid  vasculitis;  atrophie  blanche)  rep-
resents a combination of a vasculopathy plus intravascular thrombosis. 
Purpuric  lesions  and  livedo  reticularis  are  found  in  association  with 
painful ulcerations of the lower extremities. These ulcers are often slow 
to  heal,  but  when  they  do,  irregularly  shaped  white  scars  form.  The 
majority  of  cases  are  secondary  to  venous  hypertension,  but  possible 
underlying illnesses include disorders of hypercoagulability, for example, 
antiphospholipid syndrome and factor V Leiden (Chaps. 117 and 357).
In  pyoderma  gangrenosum,  the  border  of  untreated  active  ulcers 
has a characteristic appearance consisting of an undermined necrotic 
violaceous edge and a peripheral erythematous halo. The ulcers often 
begin as pustules that then expand rather rapidly to a size as large as 
20 cm. Although these lesions are most commonly found on the lower 
extremities, they can arise anywhere on the surface of the body, includ-
ing  at  sites  of  trauma  (pathergy).  An  estimated  30–50%  of  cases  are 
idiopathic, and the most common associated disorders are ulcerative 
colitis  and  Crohn’s  disease.  Less  commonly,  pyoderma  gangrenosum 
is associated with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, acute and chronic 
myelogenous  leukemia,  myelodysplasia,  a  monoclonal  gammopathy 
(usually IgA), or an autoinflammatory disorder. Because the histology 
of  pyoderma  gangrenosum  may  be  nonspecific  (dermal  infiltrate  of 
neutrophils  when  in  untreated  state),  the  diagnosis  requires  clinico-
pathologic correlation, in particular, the exclusion of similar-appearing 
ulcers such as necrotizing vasculitis, Meleney’s ulcer (synergistic infec-
tion at a site of trauma or surgery), dimorphic fungi, cutaneous amebi-
asis, spider bites, and factitial. In the myeloproliferative disorders, the 
ulcers may be more superficial with a pustulobullous border, and these 
lesions provide a connection between classic pyoderma gangrenosum 
and acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome).

FEVER AND RASH
The major considerations in a patient with a fever and a rash are inflam-
matory diseases versus infectious diseases. In the hospital setting, the 
most common scenario is a patient who has a drug rash plus a fever 
secondary  to  an  underlying  infection.  However,  it  should  be  empha-
sized that a drug reaction can lead to both a cutaneous eruption and a 
fever (“drug fever”), especially in the setting of DRESS, AGEP, or serum

sickness–like reaction. Additional inflammatory diseases that are often 
associated with a fever include pustular psoriasis, erythroderma, and 
Sweet syndrome. Lyme disease, secondary syphilis, and viral and bac-
terial exanthems (see “Exanthems,” above) are examples of infectious 
diseases that produce a rash and a fever. Lastly, it is important to deter-
mine whether or not the cutaneous lesions represent septic emboli (see 
“Purpura,”  above).  Such  lesions  usually  have  evidence  of  ischemia  in 
the form of purpura, necrosis, or impending necrosis (gunmetal-gray 
color). In the patient with thrombocytopenia, however, purpura can be 
seen  in  inflammatory  reactions  such  as  morbilliform  drug  eruptions 
and infectious lesions.

59 Immunologically  

Mediated Skin Diseases
Kim B. Yancey, Benjamin F. Chong,  
Thomas J. Lawley

A  number  of  immunologically  mediated  skin  diseases  and  immuno-
logically  mediated  systemic  disorders  with  cutaneous  manifestations 
are  now  recognized  as  distinct  entities  with  consistent  clinical,  his-
tologic,  and  immunopathologic  findings.  Clinically,  these  disorders 
are characterized by morbidity (pain, pruritus, disfigurement) and, in 
some instances, result in death (largely due to loss of epidermal barrier 
function and/or secondary infection). The major features of the more 
common immunologically mediated skin diseases are summarized in 
this chapter (Table 59-1), as are autoimmune systemic disorders with 
cutaneous manifestations.

AUTOIMMUNE CUTANEOUS DISEASES
 ■ PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS
Pemphigus refers to a group of autoantibody-mediated intraepidermal 
blistering diseases characterized by loss of cohesion between epidermal 
cells  (a  process  termed  acantholysis).  Manual  pressure  to  the  skin  of 
these  patients  may  elicit  the  separation  of  the  epidermis  (Nikolsky’s 
sign). This finding, while characteristic of pemphigus, is not specific to 
this group of disorders and is also seen in toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and a few other skin diseases.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a mucocutaneous blistering disease that 
predominantly occurs in patients >40 years of age. PV typically begins 
on mucosal surfaces and often progresses to involve the skin. This dis-
ease is characterized by fragile, flaccid blisters that rupture to produce 
extensive denudation of mucous membranes and skin (Fig. 59-1). The 
mouth, scalp, face, neck, axilla, groin, and trunk are typically involved. 
PV may be associated with severe skin pain; some patients experience 
pruritus  as  well.  Lesions  usually  heal  without  scarring  except  at  sites 
complicated  by  secondary  infection  or  mechanically  induced  dermal 
wounds.  Postinflammatory  hyperpigmentation  is  usually  present  for 
some time at sites of healed lesions.

Biopsies of early lesions demonstrate intraepidermal vesicle forma-
tion secondary to loss of cohesion between epidermal cells (i.e., acan-
tholytic blisters). Blister cavities contain acantholytic epidermal cells, 
which appear as round homogeneous cells containing hyperchromatic 
nuclei. Basal keratinocytes remain attached to the epidermal basement 
membrane; hence, blister formation takes place within the suprabasal 
portion of the epidermis. Lesional skin may contain focal collections 
of  intraepidermal  eosinophils  within  blister  cavities;  dermal  altera-
tions are slight, often limited to an eosinophil-predominant leukocytic 
infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy of lesional or intact 
patient  skin  shows  deposits  of  IgG  on  the  surface  of  keratinocytes; 
deposits  of  complement  components  are  typically  found  in  lesional 
but  not  in  uninvolved  skin.  Deposits  of  IgG  on  keratinocytes  are 
derived  from  circulating  autoantibodies  to  cell-surface  autoantigens.

aAutoantigens bound by these patients’ autoantibodies are defined as follows: Dsg1, desmoglein 1; Dsg3, desmoglein 3; BPAG1, bullous pemphigoid antigen 1; BPAG2, 
bullous pemphigoid antigen 2.
Abbreviation: BMZ, basement membrane zone.

Such  circulating  autoantibodies  can  be  demonstrated  in  80–90%  of 
PV  patients  by  indirect  immunofluorescence  microscopy;  monkey 
esophagus  is  the  optimal  substrate  for  these  studies.  Patients  with 
PV  have  IgG  autoantibodies  to  desmogleins  (Dsgs),  transmembrane 
desmosomal  glycoproteins  that  belong  to  the  cadherin  family  of  cal-
cium-dependent adhesion molecules. Such autoantibodies can be pre-
cisely  quantitated  by  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA). 
Patients with early PV (i.e., mucosal disease) have IgG autoantibodies 
to Dsg3; patients with advanced PV (i.e., mucocutaneous disease) have 

IgG autoantibodies to both Dsg3 and Dsg1. Experimental studies have 
shown that autoantibodies from patients with PV are pathogenic (i.e., 
responsible  for  blister  formation)  and  that  their  titer  correlates  with 
disease activity. Recent studies have shown that the anti-Dsg autoanti-
body profile in these patients’ sera as well as the tissue distribution of 
Dsg3 and Dsg1 determine the site of blister formation in patients with 
PV. Coexpression of Dsg3 and Dsg1 by epidermal cells protects against 
pathogenic IgG antibodies to either of these cadherins but not against 
pathogenic autoantibodies to both.

PV  can  be  life-threatening.  Prior  to  the  availability  of  glucocor-
ticoids,  mortality  rates  ranged  from  60%  to  90%;  the  current  figure 
is  ~5%.  Common  causes  of  morbidity  and  death  are  infection  and 
complications  of  treatment.  Bad  prognostic  factors  include  advanced 
age,  widespread  involvement,  and  the  requirement  for  high  doses  of 
glucocorticoids (with or without other immunosuppressive agents) for 
control of disease. The course of PV in individual patients is variable 
and  difficult  to  predict.  Some  patients  experience  remission,  while 
others may require long-term treatment or succumb to complications 
of their disease or its treatment. The mainstay of treatment is systemic 
glucocorticoids alone or in combination with other immunosuppres-
sive agents. Patients with moderate to severe PV are usually started on 
prednisone at doses ≤1 mg/kg per day (single morning dose). If new 
lesions  continue  to  appear  after  1–2  weeks  of  treatment,  the  dose  of 
prednisone may need to be increased and/or combined with another 
immunosuppressive  agent.  Among  these,  rituximab  in  combination 
with prednisone often achieves remission (though maintenance ther-
apy  may  be  required  to  prevent  relapse).  Other  immunosuppressive 
agents  sometimes  combined  with  prednisone  to  treat  PV  include 
azathioprine,  mycophenolate  mofetil,  or  cyclophosphamide.  Patients 
with severe, treatment-resistant disease may derive benefit from plas-
mapheresis (six high-volume exchanges [i.e., 2–3 L per exchange] over 
~2 weeks) and/or IV immunoglobulin (IVIg). It is important to bring 
severe or progressive disease under control quickly in order to lessen 
the  severity  and/or  duration  of  this  disorder.  Increasingly,  rituximab 
and  daily  glucocorticoids  are  used  early  in  PV  patients  to  avert  the 
development of advanced and/or treatment-resistant disease.

 ■ PEMPHIGUS FOLIACEUS
Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is distinguished from PV by several features. 
In  PF,  acantholytic  blisters  are  located  high  within  the  epidermis, 
usually just beneath the stratum corneum. Hence, PF is a more super-
ficial blistering disease than PV. The distribution of lesions in the two 
disorders  is  much  the  same,  except  that  in  PF  mucous  membranes 
are  almost  always  spared.  Patients  with  PF  rarely  have  intact  blisters 
but  rather  exhibit  shallow  erosions  associated  with  erythema,  scale, 
and crust formation. Mild cases of PF can resemble severe seborrheic 
dermatitis;  severe  PF  may  cause  extensive  exfoliation.  Sun  exposure 
(ultraviolet irradiation) may be an aggravating factor.

PF has immunopathologic features in common with PV. Specifically, 
direct  immunofluorescence  microscopy  of  perilesional  skin  demon-
strates  IgG  on  the  surface  of  keratinocytes.  Similarly,  patients  with 
PF have circulating IgG autoantibodies directed against the surface of 
keratinocytes.  In  PF,  autoantibodies  are  directed  against  Dsg1,  a  160-
kDa  desmosomal  cadherin.  These  autoantibodies  can  be  quantitated 
by ELISA. As noted for PV, the autoantibody profile in patients with PF 
(i.e., anti-Dsg1 IgG) and the tissue distribution of this autoantigen (i.e., 
expression in oral mucosa that is compensated by coexpression of Dsg3) 
are thought to account for the distribution of lesions in this disease.

Endemic forms of PF are found in south-central rural Brazil, where 
the disease is known as fogo salvagem (FS), as well as in selected sites in 
Latin America and Tunisia. Endemic PF, like other forms of this disease, 
is mediated by IgG autoantibodies to Dsg1. Clusters of FS overlap with 
those  of  leishmaniasis,  a  disease  transmitted  by  bites  of  the  sand  fly 
Lutzomyia longipalis. Studies have shown that sand fly salivary antigens 
(specifically, the LJM11 salivary protein) are recognized by IgG autoan-
tibodies from FS patients (as well as by monoclonal antibodies to Dsg1 
derived from these patients). The demonstration that mice immunized 
with LJM11 produce antibodies to Dsg1 suggests that insect bites may 
deliver  salivary  antigens,  initiate  a  cross-reactive  humoral  immune 
response, and lead to FS in genetically susceptible individuals.

Although pemphigus has been associated with several autoimmune 
diseases,  its  association  with  thymoma  and/or  myasthenia  gravis  is 
particularly notable. To date, >30 cases of thymoma and/or myasthenia 
gravis have been reported in association with pemphigus, usually with 
PF.  Patients  may  also  develop  pemphigus  as  a  consequence  of  drug 
exposure; drug-induced pemphigus usually resembles PF rather than 
PV.  Drugs  containing  a  thiol  group  in  their  chemical  structure  (e.g., 
penicillamine, captopril, enalapril) are most commonly associated with 

drug-induced pemphigus. Nonthiol drugs linked to pemphigus include 
penicillins,  cephalosporins,  and  piroxicam.  Some  cases  of  drug- 
induced  pemphigus  are  durable  and  require  treatment  with  systemic 
glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressive agents.

PF  is  generally  a  less  severe  disease  than  PV  and  usually  carries 
a  better  prognosis.  Localized  disease  can  sometimes  be  treated  with 
topical or intralesional glucocorticoids; more active cases can usually 
be  controlled  with  systemic  glucocorticoids  either  alone  or  in  com-
bination  with  other  immunosuppressive  agents.  Patients  with  severe, 
treatment-resistant disease may require more aggressive interventions, 
as described above for patients with PV.

 ■ PARANEOPLASTIC PEMPHIGUS
Paraneoplastic  pemphigus  (PNP)  is  an  autoimmune  acantholytic 
mucocutaneous  disease  associated  with  an  occult  or  confirmed  neo-
plasm.  Patients  with  PNP  typically  have  painful  stomatitis  in  asso-
ciation  with  papulosquamous  and/or  lichenoid  eruptions  that  often 
progress to blisters. Palm and sole involvement are common in these 
patients  and  raise  the  possibility  that  prior  reports  of  neoplasia- 
associated  erythema  multiforme  may  have  represented  unrecognized 
cases of PNP. Biopsies of lesional skin from these patients show varying 
combinations  of  acantholysis,  keratinocyte  necrosis,  and  vacuolar- 
interface  dermatitis.  Direct  immunofluorescence  microscopy  of  a 
patient’s skin shows deposits of IgG and complement on the surface of 
keratinocytes and (variably) similar immunoreactants in the epidermal 
basement membrane zone. Patients with PNP have IgG autoantibodies 
to  cytoplasmic  proteins  that  are  members  of  the  plakin  family  (e.g., 
desmoplakins I and II, bullous pemphigoid antigen [BPAG] 1, envo-
plakin,  periplakin,  and  plectin)  and  to  cell-surface  proteins  that  are 
members of the cadherin family (e.g., Dsg1 and Dsg3). Passive transfer 
studies  have  shown  that  autoantibodies  from  patients  with  PNP  are 
pathogenic in animal models.

The  predominant  neoplasms  associated  with  PNP  are  non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, thymoma, spin-
dle  cell  tumors,  Waldenström’s  macroglobulinemia,  and  Castleman’s 
disease; the last-mentioned neoplasm is particularly common among 
children with PNP. Rare cases of seronegative PNP have been reported 
in patients with B-cell malignancies previously treated with rituximab. 
In  addition  to  severe  skin  lesions,  many  patients  with  PNP  develop 
life-threatening  bronchiolitis  obliterans.  PNP  is  generally  resistant  to 
conventional therapies (i.e., those used to treat PV); rarely, a patient’s 
disease may ameliorate or even remit following ablation or removal of 
underlying neoplasms.

 ■ BULLOUS PEMPHIGOID
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a polymorphic autoimmune subepidermal 
blistering disease usually seen in the elderly. Initial lesions may consist 
of urticarial plaques; most patients eventually display tense blisters on 
either normal-appearing or erythematous skin (Fig. 59-2). The lesions 
are  usually  distributed  over  the  lower  abdomen,  groin,  and  flexor 
surface  of  the  extremities;  oral  mucosal  lesions  are  found  in  some 
patients. Pruritus may be nonexistent or severe. As lesions evolve, tense 
blisters  tend  to  rupture  and  be  replaced  by  erosions  with  or  without 
surmounting  crust.  Nontraumatized  blisters  heal  without  scarring. 
The major histocompatibility complex class II allele HLA-DQβ1*0301 
is  prevalent  in  patients  with  BP.  Though  most  cases  occur  sporadi-
cally, BP can be triggered by medications (e.g., furosemide, dipeptidyl  
peptidase-4  inhibitors,  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors),  ultraviolet 
light,  or  ionizing  radiation.  Several  studies  have  shown  that  BP  is 
associated with neurologic diseases (e.g., stroke, dementia, Parkinson’s 
disease, and multiple sclerosis).

Biopsies  of  early  lesional  skin  demonstrate  subepidermal  blisters 
and histologic features that roughly correlate with the clinical character 
of the lesion under study. Lesions on normal-appearing skin generally 
contain  a  sparse  perivascular  leukocytic  infiltrate  with  some  eosino-
phils;  conversely,  biopsies  of  inflammatory  lesions  typically  show  an 
eosinophil-rich  infiltrate  at  sites  of  vesicle  formation  and  in  perivas-
cular  areas.  In  addition  to  eosinophils,  cell-rich  lesions  also  contain 
mononuclear  cells  and  neutrophils.  It  is  not  possible  to  distinguish

bullous  diseases  by  light  microscopy  is  difficult.  However,  direct 
immunofluorescence microscopy of perilesional skin from PG patients 
reveals the immunopathologic hallmark of this disorder: linear depos-
its of C3 in the epidermal basement membrane. These deposits develop 
as a consequence of complement activation produced by low-titer IgG 
anti–basement membrane autoantibodies directed against BPAG2, the 
same hemidesmosome-associated protein that is targeted by autoanti-
bodies in patients with BP—a subepidermal bullous disease that resem-
bles PG clinically, histologically, and immunopathologically.

The goals of therapy in patients with PG are to prevent the devel-
opment of new lesions, relieve intense pruritus, and care for erosions 
at  sites  of  blister  formation.  Many  patients  require  treatment  with 
moderate doses of daily glucocorticoids (i.e., 20–40 mg of prednisone) 
at some point in their course. Mild  cases (or brief flare-ups) may be 
controlled  by  vigorous  use  of  potent  topical  glucocorticoids.  Infants 
born of mothers with PG appear to be at increased risk of being born 
slightly premature or “small for dates.” Current evidence suggests that 
there  is  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of  uncomplicated  live  births 
between PG patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids and those 
managed more conservatively. If systemic glucocorticoids are admin-
istered,  newborns  are  at  risk  for  development  of  reversible  adrenal 
insufficiency.

 ■ DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS
Dermatitis  herpetiformis  (DH)  is  an  intensely  pruritic,  papulovesic-
ular  skin  disease  characterized  by  lesions  symmetrically  distributed 
over  extensor  surfaces  (i.e.,  elbows,  knees,  buttocks,  back,  scalp,  and 
posterior neck) (see Fig. 56-8). Primary lesions in this disorder consist 
of  papules,  papulovesicles,  or  urticarial  plaques.  Because  pruritus  is 
prominent, patients may present with excoriations and crusted papules 
but no observable primary lesions. Patients sometimes report that their 
pruritus  has  a  distinctive  burning  or  stinging  component;  the  onset 
of  such  local  symptoms  reliably  heralds  the  development  of  distinct 
clinical lesions 12–24 h later. Almost all DH patients have associated, 
usually  subclinical,  gluten-sensitive  enteropathy  (Chap.  325),  and 
>90%  express  the  HLA-B8/DRw3  and  HLA-DQw2  haplotypes.  DH 
may present at any age, including in childhood; onset in the second to 
fourth decades is most common. The disease is typically chronic.

Biopsy  of  early  lesional  skin  reveals  neutrophil-rich  infiltrates 
within  dermal  papillae.  Neutrophils,  fibrin,  edema,  and  microvesicle 
formation at these sites are characteristic of early disease. Older lesions 
may  demonstrate  nonspecific  features  of  a  subepidermal  bulla  or  an 
excoriated papule. Because the clinical and histologic features of this 
disease  can  be  variable  and  resemble  those  of  other  subepidermal 
blistering  disorders,  the  diagnosis  is  confirmed  by  direct  immuno-
fluorescence microscopy of normal-appearing perilesional skin. Such 
studies  demonstrate  granular  deposits  of  IgA  (with  or  without  com-
plement components) in the papillary dermis and along the epidermal 
basement membrane zone. IgA deposits in the skin are unaffected by 
control  of  disease  with  medication;  however,  these  immunoreactants 
diminish  in  intensity  or  disappear  in  patients  maintained  for  long 
periods on a strict gluten-free diet (see below). Patients with DH have 
granular deposits of IgA in their epidermal basement membrane zone 
and should be distinguished from individuals with linear IgA deposits 
at this site (see below).

Although  most  DH  patients  do  not  report  overt  gastrointestinal 
symptoms  or  have  laboratory  evidence  of  malabsorption,  biopsies  of 
the  small  bowel  usually  reveal  blunting  of  intestinal  villi  and  a  lym-
phocytic  infiltrate  in  the  lamina  propria.  As  is  true  for  patients  with 
celiac  disease,  this  gastrointestinal  abnormality  can  be  reversed  by  a 
gluten-free diet. Moreover, if maintained, this diet alone may control 
the skin disease and eventuate in clearance of IgA deposits from these 
patients’  epidermal  basement  membrane  zones.  Subsequent  gluten 
exposure in such patients alters the morphology of their small bowel, 
elicits a flare-up of their skin disease, and is associated with the reap-
pearance of IgA in their epidermal basement membrane zones. As in 
patients with celiac disease, dietary gluten sensitivity in patients with 
DH is associated with IgA anti-endomysial autoantibodies that target 
tissue  transglutaminase.  Studies  indicate  that  patients  with  DH  also

urticarial bases. (Courtesy of the Yale Resident’s Slide Collection; with permission.)

BP  from  other  subepidermal  blistering  diseases  by  routine  histologic 
studies alone.

Direct  immunofluorescence  microscopy  of  normal-appearing  per-
ilesional skin from patients with BP shows linear deposits of IgG and/
or C3 in the epidermal basement membrane. The sera of ~70% of these 
patients contain circulating IgG autoantibodies that bind the epidermal 
basement membrane of normal human skin in indirect immunofluo-
rescence microscopy. IgG from an even higher percentage of patients 
reacts with the epidermal side of 1 M NaCl split skin (an alternative 
immunofluorescence  microscopy  test  substrate  used  to  distinguish 
circulating IgG autoantibodies to the basement membrane in patients 
with BP from those in patients with similar, yet different, subepidermal 
blistering diseases; see below). In BP, circulating autoantibodies recog-
nize  230-  and  180-kDa  hemidesmosome-associated  proteins  in  basal 
keratinocytes  (i.e.,  BPAG1  and  BPAG2,  respectively).  Autoantibodies 
to BPAG2 are thought to deposit in situ, activate complement, produce 
dermal  mast-cell  degranulation,  and  generate  granulocyte-rich  infil-
trates that cause tissue damage and blister formation.

BP  may  persist  for  months  to  years,  with  exacerbations  or  remis-
sions.  Extensive  involvement  may  result  in  widespread  erosions  and 
compromise  cutaneous  integrity;  elderly  and/or  debilitated  patients 
may die. Local or minimal disease can sometimes be controlled with 
potent topical glucocorticoids alone; more extensive lesions generally 
respond  to  systemic  glucocorticoids  either  alone  or  in  combination 
with other agents. Adjuncts to systemic glucocorticoids include doxy-
cycline, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab.
 ■ PEMPHIGOID GESTATIONIS
Pemphigoid gestationis (PG), also known as herpes gestationis, is a rare, 
nonviral,  subepidermal  blistering  disease  of  pregnancy  and  the  puer-
perium.  PG  may  begin  during  any  trimester  of  pregnancy  or  present 
shortly after delivery. Lesions are usually distributed over the abdomen, 
trunk, and extremities; mucous membrane lesions are rare. Skin lesions 
in these patients may be quite polymorphic and consist of erythematous 
urticarial  papules  and  plaques,  vesiculopapules,  and/or  frank  bullae. 
Lesions  are  almost  always  extremely  pruritic.  Severe  exacerbations  of 
PG  frequently  follow  delivery,  typically  within  24–48  h.  PG  tends  to 
recur in subsequent pregnancies, often beginning earlier during such 
gestations.  Brief  flare-ups  of  disease  may  occur  with  resumption  of 
menses and may develop in patients later exposed to oral contracep-
tives.  Occasionally,  infants  of  affected  mothers  have  transient  skin 
lesions.

Biopsies  of  early  lesional  skin  show  teardrop-shaped  subepidermal 
vesicles forming in dermal papillae in association with an eosinophil-rich 
leukocytic  infiltrate.  Differentiation  of  PG  from  other  subepidermal

have  high-avidity  IgA  autoantibodies  to  epidermal  transglutaminase 
and  that  the  latter  is  co-localized  with  granular  deposits  of  IgA  in 
the  papillary  dermis  of  DH  patients.  Patients  with  DH  also  have  an 
increased  incidence  of  thyroid  abnormalities,  achlorhydria,  atrophic 
gastritis, and autoantibodies to gastric parietal cells. These associations 
likely relate to the high frequency of the HLA-B8/DRw3 haplotype in 
these patients, since this marker is commonly linked to autoimmune 
disorders.  The  mainstay  of  treatment  of  DH  is  dapsone,  a  sulfone. 
Patients respond rapidly (24–48 h) to dapsone, but require careful pre-
treatment evaluation (e.g., screening for glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-
genase deficiency) and close follow-up to ensure that complications are 
avoided or controlled. All patients taking dapsone at >100 mg/d will 
have  some  hemolysis  and  methemoglobinemia,  which  are  expected 
pharmacologic side effects of this agent. Gluten restriction can control 
DH  and  lessen  dapsone  requirements;  this  diet  must  rigidly  exclude 
gluten  to  be  of  maximal  benefit.  Many  months  of  dietary  restriction 
may be necessary before a beneficial result is achieved. Good dietary 
counseling by a trained dietitian is essential.

 ■ LINEAR IGA DISEASE
Linear IgA disease, once considered a variant form of DH, is actually a 
separate and distinct entity. Clinically, patients with linear IgA disease 
may resemble individuals with DH, BP, or other subepidermal blister-
ing diseases. Lesions typically consist of papulovesicles, bullae, and/or 
urticarial  plaques  that  develop  predominantly  on  central  or  flexural 
sites. Oral mucosal involvement occurs in some patients. Severe pru-
ritus resembles that seen in patients with DH. Patients with linear IgA 
disease do not have an increased frequency of the HLA-B8/DRw3 hap-
lotype or an associated enteropathy and therefore are not candidates for 
treatment with a gluten-free diet.

Histologic alterations in early lesions may be virtually indistinguish-
able from those in DH. However, direct immunofluorescence micros-
copy  of  normal-appearing  perilesional  skin  reveals  a  linear  band  of 
IgA (and often C3) in the epidermal basement membrane zone. Most 
patients  with  linear  IgA  disease  have  circulating  IgA  anti-basement 
membrane  autoantibodies  directed  against  neoepitopes  in  the  prote-
olytically  processed  extracellular  domain  of  BPAG2.  These  patients 
generally respond to treatment with dapsone (50–200 mg/d) alone or 
in combination with low daily doses of prednisone.

 ■ EPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA ACQUISITA
Epidermolysis  bullosa  acquisita  (EBA)  is  a  rare,  noninherited,  poly-
morphic,  chronic,  subepidermal  blistering  disease.  (The  inherited 
form is discussed in Chap. 413.) Patients with classic or noninflam-
matory EBA have blisters on noninflamed skin, atrophic scars, milia, 
nail  dystrophy,  hair  loss,  and  oral  lesions.  Because  lesions  generally 
occur  at  sites  exposed  to  minor  trauma,  classic  EBA  is  considered  a 
mechanobullous  disease.  Other  patients  with  EBA  have  widespread 
inflammatory  scarring  and  bullous  lesions  that  resemble  severe  BP. 
Inflammatory  EBA  may  evolve  into  the  classic,  noninflammatory 
form  of  this  disease.  Rarely,  patients  present  with  lesions  that  pre-
dominate on mucous membranes. The HLA-DR2 haplotype is found 
with  increased  frequency  in  EBA  patients.  Studies  suggest  that  EBA 
is  sometimes  associated  with  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (especially 
Crohn’s disease).

The histology of lesional skin varies with the character of the lesion 
being  studied.  Noninflammatory  bullae  are  subepidermal,  feature  a 
sparse leukocytic infiltrate, and resemble the lesions in patients with por-
phyria  cutanea  tarda.  Inflammatory  lesions  consist  of  neutrophil-rich 
subepidermal blisters. EBA patients have continuous deposits of IgG 
(and frequently C3) in a linear pattern within the epidermal basement 
membrane  zone.  Ultrastructurally,  these  immunoreactants  are  found 
in  the  sublamina  densa  region  in  association  with  anchoring  fibrils. 
Approximately  50%  of  EBA  patients  have  demonstrable  circulating 
IgG  anti-basement  membrane  autoantibodies  directed  against  type 
VII  collagen—the  collagen  species  that  makes  up  anchoring  fibrils. 
Such IgG autoantibodies bind the dermal side of 1 M NaCl split skin 
(in contrast to IgG autoantibodies in patients with BP). Studies have 
shown that passive transfer of experimental or patient IgG against type 

VII collagen can produce lesions in mice that clinically, histologically, 
and immunopathologically resemble those in patients with EBA.

Treatment  of  EBA  is  generally  unsatisfactory.  Some  patients  with 
inflammatory  EBA  may  respond  to  systemic  glucocorticoids,  either 
alone  or  in  combination  with  immunosuppressive  agents.  Other 
patients  (especially  those  with  neutrophil-rich  inflammatory  lesions) 
may respond to dapsone. The chronic, noninflammatory form of EBA 
is largely resistant to treatment, although some patients may respond 
to prednisone in combination with rituximab, cyclosporine, mycophe-
nolate mofetil, azathioprine, or IVIg.

 ■ MUCOUS MEMBRANE PEMPHIGOID
Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a rare, acquired, subepithe-
lial immunobullous disease characterized by erosive lesions of mucous 
membranes  and  skin  that  result  in  scarring  of  at  least  some  sites  of 
involvement.  Common  sites  include  the  oral  mucosa  (especially  the 
gingiva) and conjunctiva; other sites that may be affected include the 
nasopharyngeal,  laryngeal,  esophageal,  and  anogenital  mucosa.  Skin 
lesions (present in about one-third of patients) tend to predominate on 
the scalp, face, and upper trunk and generally consist of a few scattered 
erosions or tense blisters on an erythematous or urticarial base. MMP 
is typically a chronic and progressive disorder. Serious complications 
may  arise  as  a  consequence  of  ocular,  laryngeal,  esophageal,  or  ano-
genital lesions. Erosive conjunctivitis may result in shortened fornices, 
symblepharon,  ankyloblepharon,  entropion,  corneal  opacities,  and 
(in  severe  cases)  blindness.  Similarly,  erosive  lesions  of  the  larynx 
may cause hoarseness, pain, and tissue loss that, if unrecognized and 
untreated, may eventuate in complete destruction of the airway. Esoph-
ageal lesions may result in stenosis and/or strictures that could place 
patients at risk for aspiration. Strictures may also complicate anogenital 
involvement.

Biopsies  of  lesional  tissue  generally  show  subepithelial  vesicu-
lobullae  and  a  mononuclear  leukocytic  infiltrate.  Neutrophils  and 
eosinophils may be seen in biopsies of early lesions; older lesions may 
demonstrate  a  scant  leukocytic  infiltrate  and  fibrosis.  Direct  immu-
nofluorescence  microscopy  of  perilesional  tissue  typically  reveals 
deposits of IgG, IgA, and/or C3 in the epidermal basement membrane. 
Because  many  patients  with  MMP  exhibit  no  evidence  of  circulating 
anti-basement  membrane  autoantibodies,  testing  of  perilesional  skin 
is important diagnostically. Although MMP was once thought to be a 
single nosologic entity, it is now largely regarded as a disease pheno-
type  that  may  develop  as  a  consequence  of  an  autoimmune  reaction 
to a variety of molecules in the epidermal basement membrane (e.g., 
BPAG2, laminin-332, type VII collagen, α6β4 integrin) and other anti-
gens yet to be completely defined. Studies suggest that MMP patients 
with  autoantibodies  to  laminin-332  have  an  increased  relative  risk 
for cancer. Treatment of MMP is largely dependent upon the sites of 
involvement.  Due  to  potentially  severe  complications,  patients  with 
ocular,  laryngeal,  esophageal,  and/or  anogenital  involvement  require 
aggressive systemic treatment with dapsone, prednisone, or the latter in 
combination with another immunosuppressive agent (e.g., rituximab, 
azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide), or IVIg. 
Less threatening forms of the disease may be managed with topical or 
intralesional glucocorticoids.

AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEMIC DISEASES WITH 
PROMINENT CUTANEOUS FEATURES
 ■ DERMATOMYOSITIS
The  cutaneous  manifestations  of  dermatomyositis  (Chap.  365)  are 
often  distinctive  but  at  times  may  resemble  those  of  systemic  lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) (Chap. 356), scleroderma (Chap. 360), or other 
overlapping  connective  tissue  diseases  (Chap.  360).  The  extent  and 
severity of cutaneous disease may or may not correlate with the extent 
and severity of the myositis. The cutaneous manifestations of dermat-
omyositis are similar, whether the disease appears in children or in the 
elderly,  except  that  calcification  of  subcutaneous  tissue  is  a  common 
late  sequela  in  childhood  dermatomyositis.  Dermatomyositis  may  be 
associated with interstitial lung disease or cancer.

of severe muscle disease, Gottron’s papules, heliotrope erythema, and 
poikiloderma serves to distinguish patients with dermatomyositis. Skin 
biopsy  of  the  erythematous,  scaling  lesions  of  dermatomyositis  may 
reveal only mild nonspecific inflammation, but sometimes may show 
changes indistinguishable from those found in cutaneous lupus eryth-
ematosus (LE), including epidermal atrophy, hydropic degeneration of 
basal keratinocytes, and dermal changes consisting of interstitial mucin 
deposition and a mild mononuclear cell perivascular infiltrate. Direct 
immunofluorescence  microscopy  of  lesional  skin  is  usually  negative, 
although granular deposits of immunoglobulin(s) and complement in 
the epidermal basement membrane zone have been described in some 
patients. Treatment should be stratified based on the relative severity 
of disease. Topical treatments include glucocorticoids, sunscreens, and 
aggressive  photoprotective  measures.  Treatment  of  systemic  disease 
includes  antimalarials  (though  some  patients  may  develop  a  drug 
eruption  upon  initiation  of  therapy)  or  systemic  glucocorticoids  in 
conjunction with methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, 
rituximab, or IVIg.
 ■ LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS
The cutaneous manifestations of LE (Chap. 356) can be divided into 
acute, subacute, and chronic types. Acute cutaneous LE is characterized 
by erythema of the nose and malar eminences in a “butterfly” distribu-
tion (Fig. 59-5A). The erythema is often sudden in onset, accompanied

FIGURE 59-3  Dermatomyositis. Periorbital violaceous erythema characterizes the 
classic heliotrope rash. (Courtesy of James Krell, MD; with permission.)

The  cutaneous  signs  of  dermatomyositis  may  precede  or  follow 
the development of myositis by weeks to years. Cases lacking muscle 
involvement (i.e., dermatomyositis sine myositis or amyopathic derma-
tomyositis) have also been reported. The most common manifestation 
is a purple-red discoloration of the upper eyelids, sometimes associated 
with scaling (“heliotrope” erythema; Fig. 59-3) and periorbital edema. 
Erythema  on  the  cheeks  and  nose  in  a  “butterfly”  distribution  may 
resemble the malar eruption of SLE. Erythematous or violaceous thin, 
scaly plaques are common on the upper trunk and neck (shawl sign), 
the scalp, lateral aspects of the thighs (holster sign), and the extensor 
surfaces of the forearms and hands (tendon streaking). Approximately 
one-third of patients have violaceous, flat-topped papules over the dor-
sal interphalangeal joints that are pathognomonic of dermatomyositis 
(Gottron’s  papules)  (Fig. 59-4).  Thin  violaceous  papules  and  plaques 
on the elbows and knees of patients with dermatomyositis are referred 
to as Gottron’s sign. These lesions can be contrasted with the erythema 
and scaling on the dorsum of the fingers that spares the skin over the 
interphalangeal joints of some SLE patients. Periungual telangiectasias 
and edema may be prominent in patients with dermatomyositis. Other 
patients,  particularly  those  with  long-standing  disease,  develop  areas 
of  hypopigmentation,  hyperpigmentation,  mild  atrophy,  and  telang-
iectasia known as poikiloderma. Poikiloderma is rare in both SLE and 
scleroderma  and  thus  can  serve  as  a  clinical  sign  that  distinguishes 
dermatomyositis  from  these  two  diseases.  Cutaneous  changes  may 
be  similar  in  dermatomyositis  and  various  overlap  syndromes  where

are also evident.

by  edema  and  fine  scale,  and  correlated  with  systemic  involvement. 
Patients may have widespread involvement of the face as well as eryth-
ema and scaling of the extensor surfaces of the extremities and upper 
chest (Fig. 59-5B). These acute lesions, while sometimes evanescent, 
usually  last  for  days  and  are  often  associated  with  exacerbations  of 
systemic disease. Skin biopsy of acute lesions typically shows hydropic 
degeneration of basal keratinocytes, dermal edema, and (in some cases) 
a sparse perivascular infiltrate of mononuclear cells in the upper der-
mis as well as dermal mucin. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy 
of lesional skin frequently reveals deposits of immunoglobulin(s) and 
complement in the epidermal basement membrane zone. Treatment of 
cutaneous  disease  includes  topical  glucocorticoids,  aggressive  photo-
protection, antimalarials, and control of systemic disease. Treatment of 
systemic disease associated with acute cutaneous LE includes systemic 
glucocorticoids in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) is characterized by 
a  widespread  photosensitive,  nonscarring  eruption.  In  most  patients, 
renal and central nervous system involvement is mild or absent. SCLE 
may present as a papulosquamous eruption that resembles psoriasis or 
as annular polycyclic lesions. In the papulosquamous form, discrete ery-
thematous papules arise on the back, chest, shoulders, extensor surfaces 
of the arms, and dorsum of the hands; lesions are uncommon on the 
central face and the flexor surfaces of the arms as well as below the waist. 
These slightly scaling papules tend to merge into plaques. The annular 
form involves the same areas and presents with erythematous papules 
that evolve into oval, circular, or polycyclic lesions. The lesions of SCLE 
are more widespread but have less tendency for scarring than lesions of 
discoid LE. In many patients with SCLE, drugs (e.g., hydrochlorothiaz-
ide, calcium channel blockers, antifungals, proton pump inhibitors) may 
induce  or  exacerbate  disease.  Skin  biopsy  typically  reveals  epidermal 
changes that include atrophy, hydropic degeneration of basal keratino-
cytes, and apoptosis accompanied by an infiltrate of mononuclear cells 
in the upper dermis. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy of lesional 
skin reveals deposits of immunoglobulin(s) in the epidermal basement 
membrane zone in about one-half of these cases. A particulate pattern 
of  IgG  deposition  throughout  the  epidermis  has  been  associated  with 
SCLE. Most SCLE patients have anti-Ro autoantibodies. Local therapy 
alone  is  usually  unsuccessful.  Most  patients  require  treatment  with 
aminoquinoline  antimalarial  drugs.  Low-dose  therapy  with  oral  glu-
cocorticoids is sometimes necessary. Photoprotective measures against 
both ultraviolet B and ultraviolet A wavelengths are very important.

Chronic cutaneous LE has multiple subtypes; discoid LE (DLE) is the 
most  common.  DLE  is  characterized  by  discrete  lesions,  most  often 
found on the face, scalp, and/or external ears. The lesions are eryth-
ematous papules or plaques with a thick, adherent scale that occludes 
hair  follicles  (follicular  plugging).  When  the  scale  is  removed,  its 
underside  shows  small  excrescences  that  correlate  with  the  openings 
of hair follicles (so-called “carpet tacking”), a finding relatively specific 
for DLE. Long-standing lesions develop central atrophy, scarring, and 
hypopigmentation but frequently have erythematous, sometimes raised 
borders (Fig. 59-6). These lesions persist for years and tend to expand 
slowly. Up to 20% of patients with DLE eventually meet the American 
College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE. Typical discoid lesions are 
frequently  seen  in  patients  with  SLE.  Biopsy  of  DLE  lesions  shows 
hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, atrophy of the epidermis, hydropic 
degeneration of basal keratinocytes, thickening of the epidermal base-
ment  membrane  zone,  and  a  mononuclear  cell  infiltrate  adjacent  to 
epidermal,  adnexal,  and  microvascular  basement  membranes.  Direct 
immunofluorescence  microscopy  demonstrates  immunoglobulin(s) 
and  complement  deposits  at  the  basement  membrane  zone  in  ~90% 
of  cases.  Treatment  is  focused  on  control  of  local  cutaneous  disease 
and  consists  mainly  of  photoprotection  and  topical  or  intralesional 
glucocorticoids.  If  local  therapy  is  ineffective,  use  of  aminoquinoline 
antimalarial agents may be indicated.

 ■ SCLERODERMA AND MORPHEA
The skin changes of scleroderma (Chap. 360) may be limited or dif-
fuse.  In  both  instances,  disease  usually  begin  on  the  fingers,  hands, 
toes,  feet,  and  face,  with  episodes  of  recurrent  nonpitting  edema. 

FIGURE  59-6  Discoid  lupus  erythematosus  (DLE).  Violaceous,  hyperpigmented, 
atrophic plaques, follicular plugging, and scarring are typical features of DLE. 

Sclerosis of the skin commences distally on the fingers (sclerodactyly) 
and spreads proximally, usually accompanied by resorption of bone of 
the  fingertips,  which  may  have  punched  out  ulcers,  stellate  scars,  or 
areas of hemorrhage (Fig. 59-7). The fingers may shrink and become  
sausage-shaped,  and,  because  the  fingernails  are  usually  unaffected, 
they  may  curve  over  the  end  of  the  fingertips.  Periungual  telangiec-
tasias are usually present, but periungual erythema is rare. In diffuse 
disease,  the  extremities  show  contractures  and  calcinosis  cutis;  facial 
involvement  includes  a  smooth,  unwrinkled  brow,  taut  skin  over 
the  nose,  shrinkage  of  tissue  around  the  mouth,  and  perioral  radial 
furrowing  (Fig.  59-8).  Matlike  telangiectasias  are  often  present,  par-
ticularly on the face and hands. Involved skin feels indurated, smooth, 
and bound to underlying structures; hyper- and hypopigmentation are 
common  as  well.  Raynaud’s  phenomenon  (i.e.,  cold-induced  blanch-
ing,  cyanosis,  and  reactive  hyperemia)  is  documented  in  almost  all 
patients and can precede development of scleroderma by many years. 
The  combination  of  calcinosis  cutis,  Raynaud’s  phenomenon,  esoph-
ageal  dysmotility,  sclerodactyly,  and  telangiectasias  has  been  termed 
as  the  CREST  syndrome.  Anti-centromere  autoantibodies  have  been 
reported in a very high percentage of patients with CREST syndrome 
but in only a small minority of patients with scleroderma. Skin biopsy 
reveals thickening of the dermis, homogenization of collagen bundles, 
atrophic pilosebaceous and eccrine glands, and a sparse mononuclear 
cell infiltrate in the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Direct immunofluo-
rescence microscopy of lesional skin is usually negative. Treatments for

initial symptoms), these patients often develop localized scleroderma-
tous skin changes, weight loss, and/or neuropathy (Chap. 360).

cutaneous disease include emollients, antipruritics, and phototherapy 
(UVA1 [ultraviolet A1 irradiation] or PUVA [psoralens + ultraviolet A 
irradiation]). Treatment of systemic disease includes vascular modify-
ing agents, immunosuppressives, and antifibrotics.

Morphea  is  characterized  by  localized  thickening  and  sclerosis  of 
skin;  it  dominates  on  the  trunk.  This  disorder  may  affect  children 
or  adults.  Morphea  begins  as  erythematous  or  flesh-colored  plaques 
that become sclerotic, develop central hypopigmentation, and have an 
erythematous border. In most cases, patients have one or a few lesions, 
and  the  disease  is  termed  circumscribed  morphea.  In  some  patients, 
widespread cutaneous lesions may occur without systemic involvement 
(generalized  morphea).  Many  adults  with  generalized  morphea  have 
concomitant rheumatic or other autoimmune disorders. Skin biopsy of 
morphea is generally indistinguishable from that of scleroderma. Scle-
roderma and morphea are usually quite resistant to therapy. For this 
reason, physical therapy to prevent joint contractures and to maintain 
function is employed and is often helpful. Treatment options for early, 
rapidly progressive disease include phototherapy (UVA1 or PUVA) or 
methotrexate alone or in combination with daily glucocorticoids.

Diffuse fasciitis with eosinophilia is a clinical entity that can sometimes 
be confused with scleroderma. There is usually a sudden onset of swell-
ing,  induration,  and  erythema  of  the  extremities,  frequently  following 
significant physical exertion, initiation of hemodialysis, exposure to cer-
tain medications, or other triggers. The proximal portions of the extrem-
ities (upper arms, forearms, thighs, calves) are more often involved than 
are the hands and feet. While the skin is indurated, it usually displays 
a  woody,  dimpled,  or  “pseudocellulite”  appearance  rather  than  being 
bound down as in scleroderma; contractures may occur early secondary 
to fascial involvement. The latter may also cause muscle groups to be sep-
arated and veins to appear depressed (i.e., the “groove sign”). These skin 
findings are accompanied by peripheral-blood eosinophilia, increased 
erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate,  and  sometimes  hypergammaglobu-
linemia.  Deep  biopsy  of  affected  areas  of  skin  reveals  inflammation 
and thickening of the deep fascia overlying muscle. An inflammatory 
infiltrate  composed  of  eosinophils  and  mononuclear  cells  is  usually 
found. Patients with eosinophilic fasciitis appear to be at increased risk 
for developing bone marrow failure or other hematologic abnormali-
ties. While the ultimate course of eosinophilic fasciitis is variable, most 
patients respond favorably to treatment with prednisone. Relapses may 
occur  and  require  treatment  with  prednisone  in  combination  with 
other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents.

The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, a disorder with epidemic num-
bers of cases reported in 1989 and linked to ingestion of l-tryptophan 
manufactured  by  a  single  company  in  Japan,  is  a  multisystem  disor-
der  characterized  by  debilitating  myalgias  and  absolute  eosinophilia 
in  association  with  varying  combinations  of  arthralgias,  pulmonary

Reactions

Cutaneous reactions are the most frequent adverse reactions to med-
ications,  representing  10–15%  of  reported  adverse  drug  reactions. 
Most are benign, but a few can be life threatening. Prompt recognition 
of  severe  reactions,  drug  withdrawal,  and  appropriate  therapeutic 
interventions  can  minimize  toxicity.  This  chapter  focuses  on  adverse 
cutaneous reactions to systemic medications; it covers their incidence, 
patterns, and pathogenesis, and provides some practical guidelines on 
treatment, assessment of causality, and future use of drugs.
USE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE 
UNITED STATES
In the United States, more than 4 billion prescriptions for >60,000 drug 
products  are  dispensed  annually.  Hospital  inpatients  alone  annually 
receive  about  120  million  courses  of  drug  therapy,  and  half  of  adult 
Americans  receive  prescription  drugs  on  a  regular  outpatient  basis. 
Adverse effects of a prescription medication may result in 4.5 million 
urgent or emergency care visits and over 7000 deaths each year in the 
United States. Many patients use over-the-counter medicines that may 
cause adverse cutaneous reactions.
INCIDENCE OF CUTANEOUS REACTIONS
Several recent prospective studies reported that acute cutaneous reac-
tions to drugs affect between 2.2 and 10 per 1000 hospitalized patients. 
Reactions usually occur a few days to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy.
In a series of 48,005 inpatients over a 20-year period, morbilliform 
rash  (91%)  and  urticaria  (6%)  were  the  most  frequent  skin  reactions, 
and antimicrobials, radiocontrast, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs  (NSAIDs)  were  the  most  common  drug  associations.  Severe 
hypersensitivity reactions to medications have been reported to occur 
in  between  1  in  1000  to  2  per  million  users,  depending  on  the  reac-
tion  type.  Although  rare,  severe  cutaneous  reactions  to  drugs  have 
an  important  impact  on  health  because  of  significant  sequelae;  in 
addition,  they  may  require  hospitalization,  increase  the  duration  of 
hospital stay, or be life threatening. Some populations are at increased 
risk  of  drug  reactions,  including  elderly  patients,  patients  with  auto-
immune  disease,  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  recipients,  and 
those  with  acute  Epstein-Barr  virus  (EBV)  or  human  immunodefi-
ciency  virus  (HIV)  infection.  The  pathophysiology  underlying  this 
association is unknown but may be related to immune dysregulation. 
Individuals with advanced HIV disease (e.g., CD4 T lymphocyte count  
<200 cells/μL) have a 40- to 50-fold increased risk of adverse reactions 
to sulfamethoxazole  (Chap. 202) and increased  risk of severe hyper-
sensitivity reactions.

In  addition  to  acute  eruptions,  a  variety  of  skin  diseases  can  be 
induced  or  exacerbated  by  prolonged  use  of  drugs  (e.g.,  pruritus, 
pigmentation,  nail  or  hair  disorders,  psoriasis,  bullous  pemphigoid, 
photosensitivity, and even cutaneous neoplasms). These drug reactions 
are not frequent; however, neither their incidence nor their impact on 
public health has been evaluated.

PATHOGENESIS OF DRUG REACTIONS
Adverse cutaneous responses to drugs can arise as a result of immuno-
logic or nonimmunologic mechanisms.
 ■ NONIMMUNOLOGIC DRUG REACTIONS
Examples of nonimmunologic drug reactions are pigmentary changes 
due  to  dermal  accumulation  of  medications  or  their  metabolites, 
alteration of hair follicles by antimetabolites and signaling inhibitors, 
and  lipodystrophy  associated  with  metabolic  effects  of  anti-HIV 
medications. These side effects are predictable and sometimes can be 
prevented.

 ■ IMMUNOLOGIC DRUG REACTIONS
Evidence  suggests  an  immunologic  basis  for  most  acute  drug  erup-
tions. Drug reactions may result from immediate release of preformed 
mediators  (e.g.,  urticaria,  anaphylaxis),  antibody-mediated  reac-
tions,  immune  complex  deposition,  and  antigen-specific  responses. 
Drug-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell clones can be derived from the 
blood or from skin lesions of patients with a variety of drug allergies, 
strongly suggesting that these T cells mediate drug allergy in an antigen- 
specific  manner.  Drug  presentation  to  T  cells  is  major  histocompat-
ibility  complex  (MHC)-restricted  and  likely  involves  drug-peptide 
complex recognition by specific T-cell receptors (TCRs).

Once  a  drug  has  induced  an  immune  response,  the  phenotype  of 
the reaction is determined by the nature of effectors: cytotoxic (CD8+) 
T cells in blistering and certain hypersensitivity reactions, chemokines 
for reactions mediated by neutrophils or eosinophils, and B cell collab-
oration  for  production  of  specific  antibodies  for  urticarial  reactions. 
Immunologic  reactions  have  recently  been  classified  into  further 
subtypes  that  provide  a  useful  framework  for  designating  adverse 
drug  reactions  based  on  involvement  of  specific  immune  pathways  
(Table 60-1).

Immediate  Reactions 
Immediate  reactions  depend  on  the 
release  of  mediators  of  inflammation  by  tissue  mast  cells  or  circu-
lating  basophils.  These  mediators  include  histamine,  leukotrienes, 
prostaglandins,  bradykinins,  platelet-activating  factor,  enzymes,  and 
proteoglycans.  Drugs  can  trigger  mediator  release  either  directly 
(“anaphylactoid”  reaction)  or  through  IgE-specific  antibodies.  These 
reactions usually manifest in the skin and gastrointestinal, respiratory, 
and cardiovascular systems (Chap. 353). Primary symptoms and signs 
include pruritus, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, bron-
chospasm, laryngeal edema, and, occasionally, anaphylactic shock with 
hypotension and death. They occur within minutes of drug exposure. 
NSAIDs,  including  aspirin,  and  radiocontrast  media  are  frequent 
causes  of  direct  mast  cell  degranulation  or  anaphylactoid  reactions, 
which  can  occur  on  first  exposure.  Penicillins  and  muscle  relaxants 
used  in  general  anesthesia  are  the  most  frequent  causes  of  IgE- 
dependent  reactions  to  drugs,  which  require  prior  sensitization. 
Release of mediators is triggered when polyvalent drug protein conju-
gates cross-link IgE molecules fixed to sensitized cells. Certain routes 
of administration favor different clinical patterns (e.g., gastrointestinal 
effects from oral route, circulatory effects from intravenous route).

Immune  Complex–Dependent  Reactions  Serum  sickness  is 
produced by tissue deposition of circulating immune complexes with 
consumption  of  complement.  It  is  characterized  by  fever,  arthritis, 
nephritis, neuritis, edema, and an urticarial, papular, or purpuric rash 
(Chap.  363).  First  described  following  administration  of  nonhuman 
sera,  it  currently  occurs  in  the  setting  of  monoclonal  antibodies  and 
similar medications. In classic serum sickness, symptoms develop 6 or 
more days after drug exposure, the latent period representing the time 
needed to synthesize antibody. Vasculitis, a relatively rare complication

of drugs, may also be a result of immune complex deposition (Chap. 
363). Penicillin, cefaclor, amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 
and monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab, rituximab, and omali-
zumab may be associated with clinically similar “serum sickness–like” 
reactions (SSLR). The mechanism of this reaction is unknown but is 
unrelated to immune complex formation and complement activation, 
and systemic involvement is rare. Whereas serum sickness most com-
monly occurs in adults, SSLR is more frequently observed in children.

Delayed  Hypersensitivity  While  not  completely  understood, 
delayed hypersensitivity directed by drug-specific T cells is an impor-
tant  mechanism  underlying  the  most  common  drug  eruptions,  that

(SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (Table 60-1). Drug-specific 
T cells have been detected in these types of drug eruptions. In TEN, 
skin  lesions  contain  T  lymphocytes  reactive  to  autologous  lympho-
cytes  and  keratinocytes  in  a  drug-specific,  human  leukocyte  antigen 
(HLA)-restricted,  and  perforin/granzyme-mediated  pathway.  In  the 
case of carbamazepine, studies have identified cytotoxic T lymphocytes 
(CTLs)  reactive  to  carbamazepine  that  use  highly  restricted  V-alpha 
and V-beta TCR repertoires in patients with carbamazepine hypersen-
sitivity that are not found in carbamazepine-tolerant individuals.

The mechanism(s) by which medications result in T-cell activation 
is  unknown.  Two  hypotheses  prevail:  first,  that  the  antigens  driving 
these reactions may be the native drug itself or components of the drug 
covalently complexed with endogenous proteins, presented in associa-
tion with HLA molecules to T cells through the classic antigen presen-
tation pathway or, alternatively, through direct interaction of the drug/ 
metabolite with the TCR or peptide-loaded HLA (e.g., the pharmaco-
logic interaction of drugs with immune receptors, or p-i hypothesis).

reactions demonstrate unique alterations to the MHC peptide-binding 
groove, suggesting a molecular basis for T-cell activation in the devel-
opment of hypersensitivity reactions.
 ■ GENETIC FACTORS AND CUTANEOUS DRUG 
REACTIONS

Genetic determinants may predispose individuals to severe drug 
reactions  by  affecting  either  drug  metabolism  or  immune 
responses to drugs. Polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 enzymes, 
drug  acetylation,  methylation  (such  as  thiopurine  methyltransferase 
activity  and  azathioprine),  and  other  forms  of  metabolism  (such  as 
glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  and  dapsone)  may  increase  sus-
ceptibility to drug toxicity or underdosing and increase risk for medi-
cation interactions, highlighting a role for differential pharmacokinetic 
or pharmacodynamic effects. The value of routine screening of P450 
enzymes  for  prediction  of  cutaneous  reactions  has  not  been  deter-
mined,  though  its  cost-effectiveness  in  certain  populations  (e.g., 
patients with seizure disorder, depression) as well as patients consider-
ing specific therapies (e.g., tamoxifen, warfarin) has been suggested.

Associations  between  drug  hypersensitivities  and  HLA  haplotypes 
suggest  a  key  role  for  immune  mechanisms,  especially  those  leading 
to skin involvement. Hypersensitivity to the anti-HIV medication aba-
cavir is strongly associated with HLA-B*57:01 (Chap. 202). In Taiwan, 
within a homogeneous Han Chinese population, a strong association 
was  observed  between  SJS/TEN  (but  not  DIHS)  related  to  carbam-
azepine and HLA-B*15:02. In the same population, a strong association 
was  found  between  HLA-B*58:01  and  SJS,  TEN,  or  DIHS  related  to 
allopurinol. These associations are drug and phenotype specific; that 
is,  HLA-specific  T  cell  stimulation  by  medications  leads  to  distinct 
reactions.  However,  while  this  genetic  association  is  strong,  it  is  not 
sufficient to cause severe drug hypersensitivity reactions.
 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Recognition  of  HLA  associations  with  drug  hypersensitivity  has 
resulted in recommendations to screen high-risk populations. Genetic 
screening for HLA-B*57:01 to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity, which 
carries a 100% negative predictive value when patch test confirmed and 
55%  positive  predictive  value  generalizable  across  races,  is  becoming 
the  clinical  standard  of  care  worldwide  (number  needed  to  treat  =  
13).  The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  has  recommended  
HLA-B*15:02 screening of Asian individuals prior to a new prescrip-
tion  of  carbamazepine.  The  American  College  of  Rheumatology 
has  recommended  HLA-B*58:01  screening  of  Han  Chinese  patients 
prescribed  allopurinol.  To  date,  screening  for  a  single  HLA  (but  not 
multiple HLA haplotypes) in specific populations has been determined 
to  be  cost-effective  (e.g.,  HLA-B*1301  screening  in  Chinese  patients 
with  leprosy  treated  with  dapsone).  Genetic  testing  for  specific  HLA 
haplotypes  and  functional  screening  for  TCR  repertoire  to  identify 
patients at risk is becoming more widely available and heralds the era 
of personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF CUTANEOUS 
DRUG REACTIONS
 ■ NONIMMUNE CUTANEOUS REACTIONS
Exacerbation  or  Induction  of  Dermatologic  Diseases  A 
variety  of  drugs  can  exacerbate  preexisting  diseases  or  induce—or 
unmask—a  disease  that  may  or  may  not  disappear  after  withdrawal 
of  the  inducing  medication.  For  example,  NSAIDs,  lithium,  beta 
blockers, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, interferon (IFN) α, 
and  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors  can  exacerbate 
plaque  psoriasis,  whereas  antimalarials  and  withdrawal  of  systemic 
glucocorticoids can worsen pustular psoriasis. The situation of TNF-α 
inhibitors is unusual, as this class of medications is used to treat pso-
riasis;  however,  they  may  induce  psoriasis  (especially  palmoplantar) 
in  patients  being  treated  for  other  conditions.  Acne  may  be  induced 
by  glucocorticoids,  androgens,  lithium,  and  antidepressants.  Follic-
ular  papular  or  pustular  eruptions  of  the  face  and  trunk  resembling 

acne frequently occur with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
antagonists,  mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  (MEK)  inhibitors,  and 
other targeted inhibitors. With EGFR antagonists, the severity of the 
eruption correlates with a better anticancer effect. This rash is typically 
responsive to and prevented by tetracycline antibiotics.

Several  medications  induce  or  exacerbate  autoimmune  disease. 
Checkpoint  inhibitors  induce  a  wide  array  of  systemic  autoimmune 
reactions,  including  in  skin.  Interleukin  (IL)  2,  IFN-α,  and  anti- 
TNF-α  are  associated  with  new-onset  systemic  lupus  erythematosus 
(SLE).  Drug-induced  lupus  is  classically  marked  by  antinuclear  and 
antihistone antibodies and, in some cases, anti-double-stranded DNA 
(D-penicillamine, anti-TNF-α) or perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplas-
mic  antibodies  (p-ANCA)  (minocycline).  Subacute  cutaneous  lupus 
erythematosus  (SCLE)  can  be  induced  by  a  growing  list  of  drugs, 
including thiazide diuretics, proton pump inhibitors, TNF inhibitors, 
terbinafine,  and  minocycline.  Drug-induced  dermatomyositis  may 
rarely  occur  with  TNF  inhibitors  or  capecitabine;  hydroxyurea  can 
induce skin findings of dermatomyositis. IFN and TNF inhibitors, as 
well  as  checkpoint  inhibitors,  can  induce  granulomatous  disease  and 
sarcoidosis.  Autoimmune  blistering  diseases  may  be  drug  induced 
as  well:  pemphigus  by  D-penicillamine  and  ACE  inhibitors;  bullous 
pemphigoid  by  DPP4  inhibitors,  furosemide,  and  PD-1  inhibitors; 
and linear IgA bullous dermatosis by vancomycin. Other medications 
may  cause  highly  specific  cutaneous  reactions.  Gadolinium  contrast 
has  been  associated  with  nephrogenic  systemic  fibrosis,  a  condition 
of  sclerosing  skin  with  rare  internal  organ  involvement;  advanced 
renal compromise may be an important risk factor. Granulocyte col-
ony-stimulating  factor,  azacitidine,  all-trans-retinoic  acid,  the  FLT3 
inhibitor  class  of  drugs,  and  rarely  levamisole-contaminated  cocaine 
may  induce  neutrophilic  dermatoses.  In  this  setting,  the  hypothesis 
that a drug may be responsible should always be considered, even after 
the treatment is complete. In addition, reactions may develop in cases 
of  long-term  medication  therapy  due  to  changes  in  dosing  or  host 
metabolism. Resolution of the cutaneous reaction may be delayed upon 
discontinuation of the medication.

Photosensitivity  Eruptions  Photosensitivity  eruptions  are  usu-
ally  most  marked  in  sun-exposed  areas,  but  they  may  extend  to 
sun-protected  areas.  The  mechanism  is  almost  always  phototoxicity. 
Phototoxic reactions resemble sunburn and can occur with first expo-
sure to a drug. Blistering may occur in drug-related pseudoporphyria, 
most  commonly  with  NSAIDs.  The  severity  of  the  reaction  depends 
on the tissue level of the drug, its efficiency as a photosensitizer, and 
the extent of exposure to the activating wavelengths of ultraviolet (UV) 
light (Chap. 61).

Common  orally  administered  photosensitizing  drugs  include 
fluoroquinolones, 
trimethoprim/ 
tetracycline  antibiotics,  and 
sulfamethoxazole. Other drugs less frequently implicated are chlorpro-
mazine,  thiazides,  NSAIDs,  and  BRAF  inhibitors.  Voriconazole  may 
result in severe photosensitivity, accelerated photoaging, and cutaneous 
carcinogenesis.

Because  UV-A  and  visible  light,  which  trigger  these  reactions,  are 
not  easily  absorbed  by  nonopaque  sunscreens  and  are  transmitted 
through  window  glass,  photosensitivity  reactions  may  be  difficult 
to  block.  Photosensitivity  reactions  abate  with  removal  of  either  the 
drug  or  UV  radiation,  use  of  sunscreens  that  block  UV-A  light,  and 
treatment of the reaction as one would a sunburn. Rarely, individuals 
develop persistent reactivity to light, necessitating long-term avoidance 
of sun exposure. Some chemotherapeutic agents, such as methotrexate, 
can  induce  a  UV-recall  reaction  characterized  by  an  erythematous, 
slightly scaly eruption at sites of prior severe sun exposure.

Pigmentation  Changes  Drugs,  either  systemic  or  topical,  may 
cause a variety of pigmentary changes in the skin by triggering melano-
cyte production of melanin (as in the case of oral contraceptives causing 
melasma) or due to deposition of drug or drug metabolites. Long-term 
minocycline  and  amiodarone  may  cause  blue-gray  pigmentation. 
Phenothiazine, gold, and bismuth result in gray-brown pigmentation 
of  sun-exposed  areas.  Numerous  cancer  chemotherapeutic  agents

(acetazolamide),  anticonvulsants  (phenytoin),  immunosuppressive 
agents (cyclosporine A), psoralens, and zidovudine.

Changes  in  hair  color  or  structure  are  uncommon  adverse  effects 
from  medications.  Hair  discoloration  may  occur  with  chloroquine, 
IFN-α,  chemotherapeutic  agents,  and  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors. 
Changes in hair structure have been observed in patients given EGFR 
inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and acitretin.
Drug-Induced Nail Disorders  Drug-related  nail  disorders  usu-
ally involve all 20 nails and need months to resolve after withdrawal of 
the  medication.  The  pathogenesis  is  most  often  toxic.  Drug-induced 
nail  changes  include  Beau’s  line  (transverse  depression  of  the  nail 
plate),  onycholysis  (detachment  of  the  distal  part  of  the  nail  plate), 
onychomadesis  (detachment  of  the  proximal  part  of  the  nail  plate), 
pigmentation, and paronychia (inflammation of periungual skin).
ONYCHOLYSIS  Onycholysis occurs with tetracyclines, fluoroquinolo-
nes, retinoids, NSAIDs, and others, including many chemotherapeutic 
agents, and may be triggered by exposure to sunlight.
ONYCHOMADESIS  Onychomadesis  is  caused  by  temporary  arrest  of 
nail  matrix  mitotic  activity.  Common  drugs  reported  to  induce  ony-
chomadesis include carbamazepine, lithium, retinoids, and chemother-
apeutic agents such as taxanes.
PARONYCHIA  Paronychia  and  multiple  pyogenic  granulomas  with 
progressive and painful periungual abscess of fingers and toes are side 
effects  of  systemic  retinoids,  lamivudine,  indinavir,  and  anti-EGFR 
monoclonal antibodies.
NAIL  DISCOLORATION  Some  drugs—including  anthracyclines,  tax-
anes,  fluorouracil,  psoralens,  and  zidovudine—may  induce  nail  bed 
hyperpigmentation  through  melanocyte  stimulation.  It  appears  to  be 
reversible and dose dependent.
Toxic Erythema of Chemotherapy and Other Chemotherapy 
Reactions  Because  many  agents  used  in  cancer  chemotherapy 
inhibit cell division, rapidly proliferating elements of the skin, includ-
ing  hair,  mucous  membranes,  and  appendages,  are  sensitive  to  their 
effects.  A  broad  spectrum  of  chemotherapy-related  skin  toxicities 
has been reported, including neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis, sterile 
cellulitis, exfoliative dermatitis, and flexural erythema; recent nomen-
clature classifies these under the unifying diagnosis of toxic erythema 
of  chemotherapy  (TEC)  (Fig.  60-2).  Acral  erythema  is  marked  by 
dysesthesia and an erythematous, edematous eruption of the palms and 
soles. Common causes include cytarabine, doxorubicin, methotrexate, 
hydroxyurea, fluorouracil, and capecitabine.

The  recent  introduction  of  many  new  monoclonal  antibody  and 
small  molecular  signaling  inhibitors  for  the  treatment  of  cancer  has 
been accompanied by numerous reports of skin and hair toxicity; only 
the  most  common  of  these  are  mentioned  here.  EGFR  antagonists 
induce  follicular  eruptions  and  nail  toxicity  after  a  mean  interval 
of  10  days  in  a  majority  of  patients.  Xerosis,  eczematous  eruptions, 
acneiform  eruptions,  and  pruritus  are  common.  Erlotinib  is  associ-
ated  with  marked  hair  textural  changes.  Sorafenib,  a  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitor, may result in follicular eruptions and focal bullous eruptions 
at  palmoplantar,  flexural  sites  or  areas  of  frictional  pressure.  BRAF 
inhibitors  are  associated  with  photosensitivity,  palmoplantar  hyperk-
eratosis, hair curling, dyskeratotic (Grover’s-like) rash, hyperkeratotic 
benign  cutaneous  neoplasms,  and  keratoacanthoma-like  squamous 
cell carcinomas. Rash, pruritus, and vitiliginous depigmentation have 
been reported in association with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) treatment. 
Up  to  50%  of  patients  experience  immune-mediated  skin  eruptions, 
including  granulomatous  reactions,  dermatomyositis,  panniculitis, 
and vasculitis. The checkpoint inhibitor class of drugs (including anti-
CTLA4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 agents) can induce a wide range of 
cutaneous eruptions beyond vitiligo, including lichenoid, eczematous, 
granulomatous, papulosquamous, and panniculitis eruptions.

 ■ IMMUNE CUTANEOUS REACTIONS: COMMON
Maculopapular Eruptions  Morbilliform or maculopapular erup-
tions (Fig. 60-3) are the most common of all drug-induced reactions, 

FIGURE 60-1  Warfarin necrosis involving the breasts. 

may  be  associated  with  characteristic  patterns  of  pigmentation  (e.g., 
bleomycin,  busulfan,  daunorubicin,  cyclophosphamide,  hydroxyurea, 
fluorouracil,  and  methotrexate).  Clofazimine  causes  a  drug-induced 
lipofuscinosis  with  characteristic  red-brown  coloration.  Hyperpig-
mentation of the face, mucous membranes, and pretibial and subun-
gual  areas  occurs  with  antimalarials.  Quinacrine  causes  generalized 
yellow discoloration. Pigmentation changes may also occur in mucous 
membranes (busulfan, bismuth), conjunctiva (chlorpromazine, thiori-
dazine,  imipramine,  clomipramine),  nails  (zidovudine,  doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide,  bleomycin,  fluorouracil,  hydroxyurea),  hair,  and 
teeth (tetracyclines).
Warfarin  Necrosis  of  Skin  This  rare  reaction  (0.01–0.1%)  usu-
ally occurs between the third and tenth days of therapy with warfarin, 
usually  in  women.  Common  sites  are  breasts,  thighs,  and  buttocks  
(Fig.  60-1).  Lesions  are  sharply  demarcated,  erythematous,  or  pur-
puric, and may progress to form large, hemorrhagic bullae with necro-
sis and eschar formation.

Warfarin anticoagulation in protein C or S deficiency causes an addi-
tional reduction in already low circulating levels of endogenous antico-
agulants, permitting hypercoagulability and thrombosis in the cutaneous 
microvasculature,  with  consequent  areas  of  necrosis.  Heparin-induced 
necrosis  may  have  clinically  similar  features  but  is  probably  due  to  
heparin-induced  platelet  aggregation  with  subsequent  occlusion  of 
blood vessels; it can affect areas adjacent to the injection site or more 
distant sites if infused. Levamisole-tainted cocaine (and more recently, 
heroin)  can  induce  similar  skin  necrosis;  however,  the  distribution 
tends  to  involve  the  ears  and  cheeks  predominantly,  with  stellate  or 
retiform purpura. Patients may have abnormal white blood cell counts 
and may be dual P- and C-ANCA positive.
Drug-Induced  Hair  Disorders  •  DRUG-INDUCED  HAIR  LOSS  
Medications  may  affect  hair  follicles  at  two  different  phases  of  their 
growth cycle: anagen (growth) or telogen (resting). Anagen effluvium 
occurs within days of drug administration, especially with antimetabo-
lite or other chemotherapeutic drugs. In contrast, in telogen effluvium, 
the delay is 2–4 months following initiation of a new medication. Both 
present  as  diffuse,  nonscarring  alopecia  most  often  reversible  after 
discontinuation of the responsible agent.

A  considerable  number  of  drugs  have  been  associated  with  hair 
loss. These include antineoplastic agents (alkylating agents, bleomycin, 
vinca  alkaloids,  platinum  compounds),  anticonvulsants  (carbam-
azepine,  valproate),  beta  blockers,  antidepressants,  antithyroid  drugs, 
IFNs, oral contraceptives, and cholesterol-lowering agents.
DRUG-INDUCED  HAIR  GROWTH  Medications  may  also  cause  hair 
growth. Hirsutism is an excessive growth of terminal hair with mascu-
line hair growth pattern in a female, most often on the face and trunk, 
due  to  androgenic  stimulation  of  hormone-sensitive  hair  follicles 
(anabolic  steroids,  oral  contraceptives,  testosterone,  corticotropin). 
Hypertrichosis is a distinct pattern of hair growth, not in a masculine 
pattern, typically located on the forehead and temporal regions of the 
face.  Drugs  responsible  for  hypertrichosis  include  anti-inflammatory 
drugs,  glucocorticoids,  vasodilators  (diazoxide,  minoxidil),  diuretics

Maculopapular  reactions  usually  develop 
within 1 week of initiation of therapy and last 
less than 2 weeks. Occasionally, these eruptions 
resolve despite continued use of the responsible 
drug.  Because  the  eruption  may  also  worsen, 
the suspect drug should be discontinued unless 
it  is  essential.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the 
rash  may  continue  to  progress  for  a  few  days 
up to 1 week following medication discontinu-
ation. Oral antihistamines and emollients may 
help  relieve  pruritus.  Short  courses  of  potent 
topical  glucocorticoids  can  reduce  inflamma-
tion  and  symptoms.  Systemic  glucocorticoid 
treatment is rarely indicated.
Pruritus  Pruritus  is  associated  with  almost 
all  drug  eruptions  and,  in  some  cases,  may 
represent the only symptom of the adverse cuta-
neous reaction. It may be alleviated by antihista-
mines such as hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine. 
Pruritus  stemming  from  specific  medications 
may require distinct treatment, such as selective 
opiate antagonists for opiate-related pruritus.
Urticaria/Angioedema/Anaphylaxis  
Urticaria, the second most frequent type of cuta-
neous  reaction  to  drugs,  is  characterized  by  pruritic,  red  wheals  of 
varying size rarely lasting more than 24 hours. It has been observed in 
association with nearly all drugs, most frequently ACE inhibitors, aspirin, 
NSAIDs, penicillin, and blood products. However, medications account 
for no more than 10–20% of acute urticaria cases. Deep edema within 
dermal  and  subcutaneous  tissues  is  known  as  angioedema  and  may 
involve  respiratory  and  gastrointestinal  mucous  membranes.  Urticaria 
and angioedema may be part of a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction.

Drug-induced  urticaria  may  be  caused  by  three  mechanisms:  an 
IgE-dependent  mechanism,  circulating  immune  complexes  (serum 
sickness),  and  nonimmunologic  activation  of  effector  pathways. 
IgE-dependent  urticarial  reactions  usually  occur  within  36  hours 
of  drug  exposure  but  can  occur  within  minutes.  Immune  complex–
induced  urticaria  associated  with  serum  sickness  reactions  usually 
occurs  6–12  days  after  first  exposure.  In  this  syndrome,  the  urticar-
ial  eruption  (typically  polycyclic  plaques  over  distal  joints)  may  be 
accompanied by fever, hematuria, arthralgias, hepatic dysfunction, and 
neurologic symptoms. Certain drugs, such as NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, 
angiotensin II antagonists, radiographic dye, and opiates, may induce 
urticarial  reactions,  angioedema,  and  anaphylaxis  in  the  absence  of 
drug-specific antibodies through direct mast-cell degranulation.

Radiocontrast agents are a common cause of urticaria and, in rare 
cases, can cause anaphylaxis. High-osmolality radiocontrast media are 
about  five  times  more  likely  to  induce  urticaria  (1%)  or  anaphylaxis 
than are newer low-osmolality media. About one-third of those with 
mild reactions to previous exposure react on reexposure. Pretreatment 
with prednisone and diphenhydramine reduces reaction rates.

The treatment of urticaria or angioedema depends on the severity of 
the reaction. In severe cases with respiratory or cardiovascular compro-
mise, epinephrine and intravenous glucocorticoids are the mainstay of 
therapy. For patients with urticaria without symptoms of angioedema 
or  anaphylaxis,  drug  withdrawal  and  oral  antihistamines  are  usually 
sufficient. Future drug avoidance is recommended; rechallenge, espe-
cially  in  individuals  with  severe  reactions,  should  only  occur  in  an 
intensive care setting.

Anaphylactoid  Reactions  Vancomycin  is  associated  with  red 
man syndrome, a histamine-related anaphylactoid reaction character-
ized by flushing, diffuse maculopapular eruption, and hypotension. In 
rare cases, cardiac arrest may be associated with rapid intravenous (IV) 
infusion of the medication.

FIGURE 60-2  Toxic erythema of chemotherapy. 

often start on the trunk or intertriginous areas, and consist of blanch-
ing  erythematous  macules  and  papules  that  are  symmetric  and  con-
fluent. Nonblanching, dusky, or bright-red macules as well as mucosal 
involvement  should  raise  concern  for  a  more  severe  reaction.  Facial 
involvement  in  morbilliform  eruptions  is  also  uncommon,  and  the 
presence of extensive facial lesions with facial edema suggests DIHS. 
Diagnosis  of  morbilliform  eruptions  is  rarely  assisted  by  laboratory 
testing or skin biopsy.

Morbilliform eruptions may be associated with moderate to severe 
pruritus and fever. A viral exanthem is another differential diagnostic 
consideration,  especially  in  children,  and  graft-versus-host  disease  is 
also  a  consideration  in  the  proper  clinical  setting.  Absence  of  enan-
thems; absence of ear, nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract symp-
toms; and polymorphism of the skin lesions support a drug rather than 
a viral eruption. Common offenders include aminopenicillins, cephalo-
sporins, antibacterial sulfonamides, allopurinol, and antiepileptic drugs. 
Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors are rarely 
the culprit; however, any drug can cause a morbilliform exanthem. Cer-
tain medications carry very high rates of morbilliform eruption, includ-
ing nevirapine and lamotrigine, even in the absence of DIHS reactions. 
Lamotrigine morbilliform rash is associated with higher starting doses,

FIGURE 60-4  Allergic contact dermatitis (bullous) due to adhesive tape. 

Irritant/Allergic  Contact  Dermatitis  Patients  using  topical 
medications  may  develop  an  irritant  or  allergic  contact  dermatitis  to 
the  medication  itself  or  to  a  preservative  or  other  component  of  the 
formulation. Reactions to neomycin sulfate, bacitracin, and polymyxin 
B are common. Contact dermatitis may be seen to adhesive tapes, lead-
ing to irritation or blisters around ports and IV sites (Fig. 60-4). Harsh 
disinfectant skin cleansers may lead to localized irritant dermatitis.

Fixed Drug Eruptions  These less common reactions are charac-
terized by one or more sharply demarcated, dull red to brown lesions, 
sometimes  with  central  dusky  violaceous  erythema  and  central  bulla 
(Fig.  60-5).  Hyperpigmentation  often  results  after  resolution  of  the 
acute inflammation. With rechallenge, the process recurs in the same 
(fixed)  location  but  may  spread  to  new  areas  as  well.  Lesions  often 
involve the lips, hands, legs, face, genitalia, and oral mucosa, and cause 
a  burning  sensation.  Most  patients  have  multiple  lesions.  Fixed  drug 
eruptions  have  been  associated  with  pseudoephedrine  (frequently 
a  nonpigmenting  reaction),  phenolphthalein  (in  laxatives),  sulfon-
amides, tetracyclines, NSAIDs, barbiturates, and others.
 ■ IMMUNE CUTANEOUS REACTIONS: RARE AND 
SEVERE
Drug-Induced Hypersensitivity Syndrome  DIHS is a systemic 
drug reaction also known as DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia 
and systemic symptoms) syndrome; because eosinophilia is not always 
present, the term DIHS is preferred. Clinically, DIHS presents with a 
prodrome of fever and flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by 

FIGURE 60-5  Fixed drug eruption.

the  appearance  of  a  diffuse  morbilliform  eruption,  usually  involving 
the face (Fig. 60-6). Facial swelling and hand/foot swelling are often 
present. Systemic manifestations include lymphadenopathy, fever, and 
leukocytosis  (often  with  eosinophilia  or  atypical  lymphocytosis),  as 
well as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myositis, and gastroenteritis, 
in  descending  order.  Distinct  patterns  of  timing  of  onset  and  organ 
involvement  may  exist.  For  example,  allopurinol  classically  induces 
DIHS with renal involvement; cardiac and lung involvement are more 
common  with  minocycline;  gastrointestinal  involvement  is  almost 
exclusively seen with abacavir; and some medications typically do not 
induce  eosinophilia  (abacavir,  dapsone,  lamotrigine).  The  cutaneous 
reaction usually begins 2–8 weeks after the drug is started and persists 
after  drug  cessation.  Signs  and  symptoms  may  continue  for  several 
weeks, especially those associated with hepatitis. The eruption recurs 
with rechallenge, and cross-reactions among aromatic anticonvulsants, 
including  phenytoin,  carbamazepine,  and  phenobarbital,  are  com-
mon.  Other  drugs  causing  DIHS  include  antibacterial  sulfonamides 
and  other  antibiotics.  Hypersensitivity  to  reactive  drug  metabolites, 
hydroxylamine  for  sulfamethoxazole  and  arene  oxide  for  aromatic 
anticonvulsants, may be involved in the pathogenesis of DIHS. Recent 
research suggests that inciting drugs may reactivate quiescent human 
herpes viruses, including herpesviruses 6 and 7, EBV, and cytomega-
lovirus (CMV), resulting in expansion of viral-specific CD8+ T lym-
phocytes  and  subsequent  end-organ  damage.  Viral  reactivation  may 
be associated with a worse clinical prognosis. Mortality rates as high as 
10% have been reported, with most fatalities resulting from liver fail-
ure.  Systemic  glucocorticoids  (1.5–2  mg/kg/d  prednisone  equivalent) 
should be started and tapered slowly over 8–12 weeks, during which 
time clinical symptoms and labs (including complete blood count with 
differential, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests) should be 
followed  carefully.  A  steroid-sparing  agent  such  as  mycophenolate 
mofetil,  IV  immunoglobulin,  or  cyclosporine  may  be  indicated  in 
cases  of  rapid  recurrence  upon  steroid  taper.  In  all  cases,  immediate

withdrawal of the suspected culprit drug is required. Given the severe 
long-term  complications  of  myocarditis,  patients  should  undergo 
cardiac evaluation in cases of severe DIHS or if heart involvement is 
suspected due to hypotension or arrhythmia. Patients should be closely 
monitored for resolution of organ dysfunction and for development of 
late-onset autoimmune thyroiditis and diabetes (up to 6 months).

Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis  
SJS  and  TEN  are  characterized  by  blisters  and  mucosal/epider-
mal  detachment  resulting  from  full-thickness  epidermal  necrosis  in 
the  absence  of  substantial  dermal  inflammation.  The  term  Stevens- 
Johnson syndrome (SJS) describes cases in which the total body surface 
area  of  blistering  and  eventual  detachment  is  <10%  (Fig.  60-7).  The 
term  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome/toxic  epidermal  necrolysis  (SJS/TEN) 
overlap is used to describe cases with 10–30% epidermal detachment  
(Fig. 60-8),  and  the  term  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis  (TEN)  is  used  to 
describe cases with >30% detachment (Figs. 60-9 and 60-10).

Other  blistering  eruptions  with  concomitant  mucositis  may  be 
confused  with  SJS/TEN.  Erythema  multiforme  (EM)  associated  with 
herpes simplex virus is characterized by painful mucosal erosions and

target  lesions,  typically  with  an  acral  distribution  and  limited  skin 
detachment. Mycoplasma and other respiratory infections in children 
cause a clinically distinct presentation with prominent mucositis and 
limited  cutaneous  involvement.  The  term  reactive  infectious  mucocu-
taneous eruption (RIME) has been proposed to help differentiate this 
clinical  entity,  which  some  believe  may  be  the  syndrome  originally 
described by Stevens and Johnson.

Patients with SJS/TEN initially present with fever >39°C (102.2°F); 
sore throat; conjunctivitis; and acute onset of painful dusky, atypical, 
target-like lesions (Fig. 60-11). Intestinal and upper respiratory tract 
involvement are associated with a poor prognosis, as are older age and 
greater  extent  of  epidermal  detachment.  At  least  10%  of  those  with

part of the epidermis, unlike the full-thickness epidermal necrosis that 
characterizes  SJS.  Before  the  pustules  appear,  AGEP  may  also  mimic 
DIHS due to the prominent fever and erythroderma.

The principal differential diagnosis for AGEP is acute pustular pso-
riasis, which has an identical clinical and histologic appearance. Many 
patients with AGEP have a personal or family history of psoriasis. AGEP 
classically begins within 24–48 hours of drug exposure, although it may 
occur as much as 1–2 weeks later. β-Lactam antibiotics, calcium channel 
blockers,  macrolide  antibiotics,  and  other  inciting  agents  (including 
radiocontrast and dialysates) have been reported. Patch testing with the 
responsible drug often results in a localized pustular eruption.

Overlap Hypersensitivity Syndromes  An important concept in 
the clinical approach to severe drug eruptions is the presence of “over-
lap syndromes,” most notably DIHS with TEN-like features, DIHS with 
pustular eruption (AGEP-like), and AGEP with TEN-like features. In 
several case series of AGEP, 50% of cases had TEN-like or DRESS-like 
features, and 20% of cases had mucosal involvement resembling SJS/
TEN. In one study, up to 20% of all severe drug eruptions had overlap 
features, suggesting that AGEP, DIHS, and SJS/TEN represent a clinical 
spectrum  with  some  common  pathophysiologic  mechanisms.  Desig-
nation  of  a  single  diagnosis  based  on  cutaneous  and  extracutaneous 
involvement  may  not  always  be  possible  in  cases  of  hypersensitivity; 
in  such  instances,  treatment  should  be  geared  toward  addressing  the 
dominant  clinical  features.  The  timing  of  rash  onset  with  respect  to 
drug  administration,  which  is  usually  much  more  delayed  in  DIHS, 
and the presence of systemic manifestations such as hepatitis are help-
ful clues to that diagnosis.

Vasculitis  Cutaneous  small-vessel  vasculitis  (CSVV)  typically 
presents  with  purpuric  papules  and  macules  involving  the  lower 
extremities and other dependent areas (Fig. 60-13) (Chap. 363). Pus-
tular  and  hemorrhagic  vesicles  as  well  as  rounded  ulcers  also  occur. 
Importantly, vasculitis may involve other organs, including the kidneys, 

414

FIGURE 60-11  Target-like lesion in SJS. 

SJS and 30% of those with TEN die from the disease. Drugs that most 
commonly  cause  SJS/TEN  are  sulfonamides,  allopurinol,  antiepilep-
tics  (e.g.,  lamotrigine,  phenytoin,  carbamazepine),  oxicam  NSAIDs, 
β-lactam  and  other  antibiotics,  and  nevirapine.  Frozen-section  skin 
biopsy may aid in rapid diagnosis.

At this time, there is no consensus on the most effective treatment 
for SJS/TEN. The best outcomes stem from early diagnosis, immediate 
discontinuation of the suspected drug, and meticulous supportive ther-
apy in an intensive care or burn unit. Fluid management, atraumatic 
wound care, infection prevention and treatment, and ophthalmologic 
and  respiratory  support  are  critical.  Early  administration  of  systemic 
glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclosporine, or etaner-
cept may improve disease outcomes, but randomized studies to evalu-
ate potential therapies are lacking and difficult to perform.

Pustular Eruptions  AGEP is a rare reaction pattern affecting 3–5 
people per million per year. It is thought to be secondary to medication 
exposure in >90% of cases (Fig. 60-12). Patients typically present with 
diffuse erythema or erythroderma, as well as high spiking fevers and 
leukocytosis  with  neutrophilia.  One  to  two  days  later,  innumerable 
pinpoint  pustules  develop  overlying  the  erythema.  The  pustules  are 
most pronounced in body fold areas; however, they may become gen-
eralized and, when coalescent, can lead to superficial erosion. In such 
cases, differentiating the eruption from SJS in its initial stages may be 
difficult, although in AGEP, any erosions tend to be more superficial, 
and prominent mucosal involvement is lacking. Skin biopsy shows col-
lections of neutrophils and sparse necrotic keratinocytes in the upper

ical  evaluation  for  systemic  involvement.  Drugs  are  implicated  as  a 
cause of roughly 15% of all cases of small-vessel vasculitis. Antibiotics, 
particularly β-lactams, are commonly implicated; however, almost any 
drug can cause vasculitis. Vasculitis may also be idiopathic or due to 
underlying infection, connective tissue disease, or (rarely) malignancy.
Rare  but  important  types  of  drug-induced  vasculitis  include 
drug-induced ANCA vasculitis. Such patients commonly present with 
cutaneous manifestations but can develop the full range of symptoms 
associated with ANCA-associated vasculitis, including crescentic glo-
merulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage. Propylthiouracil, methima-
zole, and hydralazine are common culprits. Drug-induced polyarteritis 
nodosa has been associated with long-term exposure to minocycline. 
The presence of perivascular eosinophils on skin biopsy can be a clue 
to possible drug etiology.

MANAGEMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH 
SUSPECTED DRUG ERUPTION
There are four main questions to answer regarding a suspected drug 
eruption:

1.  Is the observed rash caused by a medication?
2.  Is the reaction severe or evolving with systemic involvement?
3.  Which drug or drugs are suspected, and should they be withdrawn?
4.  What recommendation can be made for future medication use?
 ■ EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF SEVERE ERUPTIONS
Rapid  recognition  of  potentially  serious  or  life-threatening  reactions 
is paramount. In this regard, a suspected drug eruption is best defined 
initially by what it is not (e.g., SJS/TEN, DIHS). Table 60-2 lists clinical 
and laboratory features that, if present, suggest the presence of a severe 
reaction. Table 60-3 lists the most important of these reactions, along 
with  their  key  features  and  commonly  associated  medications.  Any 
concern for a serious reaction should prompt immediate consultation 
with  a  dermatologist  and/or  referral  of  the  patient  to  a  specialized 
center.
 ■ CONFIRMATION OF DRUG REACTION
The probability of drug etiology varies with the pattern of the reaction. 
Only  fixed  drug  eruptions  are  always  drug-induced.  Morbilliform

eruptions  are  usually  viral  in  children  and  drug-induced  in  adults. 
Among severe reactions, drugs account for 10–20% of anaphylaxis and 
vasculitis and between 70% and 90% of AGEP, DIHS, SJS, and TEN. 
Skin biopsy helps characterize the reaction but does not indicate drug 
causality. Blood counts and liver and renal function tests are important 
for evaluating organ involvement. The association of mild elevation of 
liver  enzymes  and  high  eosinophil  count  is  frequent  but  not  specific 
for a drug reaction. Blood tests that could identify an alternative cause, 
serologic tests (to rule out drug-induced lupus), and serology or poly-
merase  chain  reaction  for  infections  may  be  of  great  importance  to 
determine a cause.

 ■ WHAT DRUG(S) TO SUSPECT AND WITHDRAW
Most cases of drug eruptions occur during the first course of treatment 
with a new medication. A notable exception is IgE-mediated urticaria 
and anaphylaxis that need presensitization and develop a few minutes 
to  a  few  hours  after  rechallenge.  Characteristic  timing  of  onset  fol-
lowing drug administration is as follows: 4–14 days for morbilliform 
eruption, 2–4 days for AGEP, 5–28 days for SJS/TEN, and 14–48 days 
for DIHS. A drug chart, compiling information of all current and past 
medications/supplements  and  the  timing  of  administration  relative 
to the rash, is a key diagnostic tool for identifying the inciting drug. 
Medications  introduced  for  the  first  time  in  the  relevant  time  frame 
are prime suspects. Two other important elements to suspect causal-
ity at this stage are (1) previous experience with the drug (or related 
members of the same pharmacologic class) and (2) alternative etiologic 
candidates.

The  decision  to  continue  or  discontinue  any  medication  depends 
on  the  severity  of  the  reaction,  the  severity  of  the  primary  disease 
undergoing  treatment,  the  degree  of  suspicion  of  causality,  and  the 
feasibility of finding an alternative safer treatment. In any potentially 
fatal drug reaction, elimination of all possible suspect drugs or unnec-
essary  medications  should  be  immediately  attempted.  Some  rashes 
may resolve when “treating through” a benign drug-related eruption. 
The decision to treat through an eruption should, however, remain the 
exception and withdrawal of every suspect drug the general rule. On 
the other hand, drugs that are not suspected and are important for the 
patient (e.g., antihypertensive agents) generally should not be quickly 
withdrawn. This approach may permit judicious use of these agents in 
the future.

 ■ RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE USE OF DRUGS
The aims are to (1) prevent the recurrence of the drug eruption and 
(2)  avoid  compromising  future  treatment  by  inaccurately  excluding 
otherwise useful medications.

A thorough assessment of drug causality is based on timing of the 
reaction, evaluation of other possible causes, and effect of drug with-
drawal or continuation. The RegiSCAR group has proposed the Algo-
rithm  of  Drug  Causality  for  Epidermal  Necrolysis  (ALDEN)  to  rank 
likelihood  of  drug  causality  in  SJS/TEN;  validation  of  this  and  other 
instruments,  such  as  the  Naranjo  adverse  drug  reaction  probability 
scale, is limited. Medication(s) with a “definite” or “probable” causality 
should  be  contraindicated,  a  warning  card  or  medical  alert  tag  (e.g., 
wristband)  should  be  given  to  the  patient,  and  the  drugs  should  be 
listed in the patient’s medical chart as allergies.

 ■ CROSS-SENSITIVITY
Because of possible cross-sensitivity among chemically related drugs, 
many  physicians  recommend  avoidance  of  not  only  the  medication 
that induced the reaction but also all drugs of the same pharmacologic 
class.

There  are  two  types  of  cross-sensitivity.  Reactions  that  depend  on 
a pharmacologic interaction may occur with all drugs that target the 
same pathway, whether the drugs are structurally similar or not. This 
is  the  case  with  angioedema  caused  by  NSAIDs  and  ACE  inhibitors. 
In this situation, the risk of recurrence varies from drug to drug in a 
particular class; however, avoidance of all drugs in the class is usually 
recommended. Immune recognition of structurally related drugs is the 
second mechanism by which cross-sensitivity occurs. A classic example

is hypersensitivity to aromatic antiepileptics (barbiturates, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine) with up to 50% reaction to a second drug in patients 
who reacted to one. For other drugs, in vitro and in vivo data have sug-
gested that cross-reactivity exists only between compounds with very 
similar  chemical  structures.  Sulfamethoxazole-specific  lymphocytes 
may be activated by other antibacterial sulfonamides but not diuretics, 
antidiabetic drugs, or anti-COX2 NSAIDs with a sulfonamide group. 
Though it has been previously reported that 10% of patients with peni-
cillin allergies will also develop allergic reactions to cephalosporin class 
antibiotics, the cross-reactivity is likely much lower, as is the incidence 
of true penicillin allergy itself, and severe reactions are very rare.

Recent  data  suggest  that  although  the  risk  of  developing  a  drug 
eruption to another drug is increased in persons with a prior reaction, 
“cross-sensitivity”  is  probably  not  the  explanation.  As  an  example, 
those  with  a  history  of  an  allergic-like  reaction  to  penicillin  are  at 
greater risk of developing a reaction to antibacterial sulfonamides than 
to cephalosporins.

These data suggest that the list of drugs to avoid after a drug reac-
tion should be limited to the causative one(s) and to a few very similar 
medications.

Because of growing evidence that some severe cutaneous reactions 
to  drugs  are  associated  with  HLA  genes,  it  is  recommended  that 
first-degree  family  members  of  patients  with  severe  cutaneous  reac-
tions also should avoid causative agents. This may be most relevant for 
sulfonamides and antiepileptic medications.
 ■ ROLE OF TESTING FOR CAUSALITY AND DRUG 
RECHALLENGE
The  usefulness  of  laboratory  tests,  skin-prick,  or  patch  testing  to 
determine causality is debated and may be of limited practical value. 
Many in vitro immunologic assays have been developed for research 
purposes;  however,  the  predictive  value  of  these  tests  has  not  been 
validated  in  large  series  of  affected  patients.  In  some  cases,  diagnos-
tic rechallenge may be appropriate, even for drugs with high rates of 
adverse reactions.

Skin-prick testing has clinical value in specific settings. In patients 
with a history suggesting immediate IgE-mediated reactions to peni-
cillin, skin-prick testing with penicillins or cephalosporins has proven 
useful for identifying patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions to these 

agents. Negative skin tests do not totally rule out IgE-mediated reactiv-
ity; however, the risk of anaphylaxis in response to penicillin admin-
istration in patients with negative skin tests is about 1%. In contrast, 
two-thirds  of  patients  with  a  positive  skin  test  experience  an  allergic 
response upon rechallenge. The skin tests themselves carry a small risk 
of anaphylaxis.

For patients with delayed-type hypersensitivity, the clinical utility of 
skin tests remains questionable. At least one of a combination of several 
tests (prick, patch, and intradermal) is positive in 50–70% of patients 
with a reaction “definitely” attributed to a single medication. This low 
sensitivity  corresponds  to  the  observation  that  readministration  of 
drugs with negative skin testing results in eruptions in 17% of cases.

Desensitization can be considered in those with a history of reaction 
to a medication that must be used again. Efficacy of such procedures 
has been demonstrated in cases of immediate reaction to penicillin and 
positive  skin  tests,  anaphylactic  reactions  to  platinum  chemotherapy, 
and delayed reactions to sulfonamides in patients with AIDS. Desensi-
tization is often successful in HIV-infected patients with morbilliform 
eruptions  to  sulfonamides  but  is  not  recommended  in  HIV-infected 
patients who developed erythroderma or a bullous reaction in response 
to prior sulfonamide exposure. Various protocols are available, includ-
ing  oral  and  parenteral  approaches.  Oral  desensitization  appears  to 
have  a  lower  risk  of  serious  anaphylactic  reaction.  Desensitization 
carries  the  risk  of  anaphylaxis  regardless  of  how  it  is  performed  and 
should be performed in monitored clinical settings such as an intensive 
care  unit.  After  desensitization,  many  patients  experience  non-life- 
threatening reactions during therapy with the culprit drug.

 ■ REPORTING
Any severe reaction to drugs should be reported to a regulatory agency 
or to pharmaceutical companies. Because severe reactions are too rare 
to be detected in premarketing clinical trials, spontaneous reports are 
of critical importance for early detection of unexpected life-threatening 
events. To be useful, the report should contain enough details to permit 
ascertainment of severity and drug causality.

atmosphere has led to international agreements to reduce production 
of those chemicals.

Measurements of solar flux showed a 20-fold regional variation in 
the amount of energy at 300 nm that reaches the earth’s surface. This 
variability  relates  to  seasonal  effects,  the  path  that  sunlight  traverses 
through ozone and air, the altitude (a 4% increase for each 300 m of 
elevation), the latitude (increasing intensity with decreasing latitude), 
and the amount of cloud cover, fog, and pollution.

The  major  components  of  the  photobiologic  action  spectrum  that 
can affect human skin include the UV and visible wavelengths between 
290 and 700 nm. In addition, the wavelengths beyond 700 nm in the 
infrared  spectrum  primarily  emit  heat  and  in  certain  circumstances 
may exacerbate the pathologic effects of energy in the UV and visible 
spectra.

The UV spectrum reaching the Earth represents <10% of total inci-
dent solar energy and is arbitrarily divided into two major segments, 
UV-B and UV-A, which constitute the wavelengths from 290 to 400 nm.  
UV-B consists of wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm. This portion 
of the photobiologic action spectrum is the most efficient in producing 
redness or erythema in human skin and thus is sometimes known as 
the “sunburn spectrum.” UV-A includes wavelengths between 320 and 
400 nm and is ∼1000-fold less efficient in producing skin redness than 
is UV-B.

The wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm are visible to the human 
eye.  The  photon  energy  in  the  visible  spectrum  is  not  capable  of 
damaging human skin in the absence of a photosensitizing chemical. 
Without the absorption of energy by a molecule, there can be no pho-
tosensitivity. Thus, the absorption spectrum of a molecule is defined as 
the range of wavelengths it absorbs, whereas the action spectrum for an 
effect of incident radiation is defined as the range of wavelengths that 
evoke the response.

Photosensitivity  occurs  when  a  photon-absorbing  chemical  (chro-
mophore) present in the skin absorbs incident energy, becomes excited, 
and transfers the absorbed energy to various structures or to molecular 
oxygen.

 ■ UV RADIATION (UVR) AND SKIN STRUCTURE AND 
FUNCTION
Human skin consists of two major compartments: the outer epidermis, 
which is a stratified squamous epithelium, and the underlying dermis, 
which  is  rich  in  matrix  proteins  such  as  collagens  and  elastin.  Both 
compartments  are  susceptible  to  damage  from  sun  exposure.  The 
epidermis  and  the  dermis  contain  several  chromophores  capable  of 
absorbing incident solar energy, including nucleic acids, proteins, and 
lipids. The outermost epidermal layer, the stratum corneum, is a major 
absorber of UV-B, and <10% of incident UV-B wavelengths penetrate 
through the epidermis to the dermis. Approximately 3% of radiation 
below 300 nm, 20% of radiation below 360 nm, and 33% of short visi-
ble radiation reach the basal cell layer in untanned human skin. UV-A 
readily  penetrates  to  the  dermis  and  is  capable  of  altering  structural 
and matrix proteins that contribute to photoaging of chronically sun-
exposed  skin,  particularly  in  individuals  of  light  complexion.  Thus, 
longer wavelengths can penetrate more deeply into the skin.

SOLAR RADIATION
Sunlight  is  the  most  visible  and  obvious  source  of  comfort  in  the 
environment.  The  sun  provides  the  beneficial  effects  of  warmth  and 
vitamin  D  synthesis.  However,  acute  and  chronic  sun  exposure  also 
has  pathologic  consequences.  Cutaneous  exposure  to  sunlight  is  a 
major cause of human skin cancer and can have immunosuppressive 
effects as well.

The  sun’s  energy  reaching  the  Earth’s  surface  is  limited  to  com-
ponents  of  the  ultraviolet  (UV)  spectrum,  the  visible  spectrum,  and 
portions of the infrared spectrum. The cutoff at the short end of the 
UV  spectrum  at  ∼290  nm  is  due  primarily  to  stratospheric  ozone—
formed  by  highly  energetic  ionizing  radiation—that  prevents  pene-
tration to the earth’s surface of the shorter, more energetic, potentially 
more  harmful  wavelengths  of  solar  radiation.  Indeed,  concern  about 
destruction of the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons released into the 

Molecular Targets for UVR-Induced Skin Effects  Epidermal  
DNA—predominantly  in  keratinocytes  and  in  Langerhans  cells 
(dendritic  antigen-presenting  cells)—absorbs  UV-B  and  undergoes 
structural  changes  between  adjacent  pyrimidine  bases  (thymine  or 
cytosine),  including  the  formation  of  cyclobutane  dimers  and  6,4- 
photoproducts. These structural changes are potentially mutagenic and 
are found in nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), including basal cell 
carcinoma  (BCC),  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (SCC),  and  Merkel  cell 
carcinoma (MCC). They can be repaired by cellular mechanisms that 
result in their recognition and excision and the restoration of normal 
base sequences. The efficient repair of these structural aberrations is 
crucial,  since  individuals  with  defective  DNA  repair  are  at  high  risk 
for  the  development  of  cutaneous  cancer.  For  example,  patients  with 
xeroderma  pigmentosum,  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder,  have  a 
variably  deficient  repair  of  UV-induced  photoproducts.  The  skin  of

these patients often shows the dry, leathery appearance of prematurely 
photoaged skin, and these patients have an increased frequency of skin 
cancer  already  in  the  first  two  decades  of  life.  Studies  in  transgenic 
mice  have  verified  the  importance  of  functional  genes  that  regulate 
these repair pathways in preventing the development of UV-induced 
skin cancer. DNA damage to Langerhans cells may also contribute to 
the known immunosuppressive effects of UV-B (see “Photoimmunol-
ogy,” later).

In addition to DNA, molecular oxygen is a target for incident solar 
UVR,  leading  to  the  generation  of  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS). 
These  ROS  can  damage  skin  components  through  oxidative  damage 
to DNA, oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipids (lipid per-
oxidation),  or  oxidation  of  amino  acids  in  proteins,  or  they  can  lead 
to oxidative deactivation of specific enzymes. UVR can also promote 
increased  cross-linking  and  degradation  of  dermal  matrix  proteins 
and accumulation of abnormal dermal elastin, leading to photoaging 
changes known as solar elastosis.

Cutaneous  Optics  and  Chromophores  Chromophores  are 
endogenous or exogenous chemicals that can absorb physical energy. 
Endogenous chromophores are of two types: (1) normal components of 
skin, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and 7-dehydrocholesterol 
(the precursor of vitamin D); and (2) components that are synthesized 
elsewhere in the body and that circulate in the bloodstream and diffuse 
into the skin, such as porphyrins. Normally, only trace amounts of por-
phyrins are present in the skin, but, in selected diseases known as the 
porphyrias  (Chap.  416),  porphyrins  are  released  into  the  circulation 
in increased amounts from the bone marrow and/or the liver and are 
transported to the skin, where they absorb incident energy both in the 
Soret band (∼400 nm; short visible) and, to a lesser extent, in the red 
portion of the visible spectrum (580–660 nm). This energy absorption 
results in the generation of ROS that can mediate structural damage to 
the  skin,  manifested  as  erythema,  edema,  urticaria,  or  blister  forma-
tion. It is of interest that photoexcited porphyrins are currently used 
in the treatment of BCCs and SCCs and their precursor lesions, actinic 
keratoses. Known as photodynamic therapy (PDT), this modality gen-
erates ROS in the skin, leading to cell death. Topical photosensitizers 
used in PDT are the porphyrin precursors 5-aminolevulinic acid and 
methyl  aminolevulinate,  which  are  readily  converted  to  porphyrins 
in the skin. It is believed that PDT targets tumor cells for destruction 
more selectively than it targets adjacent nonneoplastic cells. The effi-
cacy of such therapy requires appropriate timing of the application of 
methyl aminolevulinate or 5-aminolevulinic acid to the affected skin 
followed by exposure to artificial sources of visible light. High-intensity 
blue light has been used successfully for PDT of thin actinic keratoses. 
Red light PDT penetrates more deeply into the skin and is more bene-
ficial in the treatment of superficial BCCs.

Acute Effects of Sun Exposure  The acute effects of skin expo-
sure to sunlight include sunburn and vitamin D synthesis.

SUNBURN  This  painful  skin  condition  is  an  acute  inflammatory 
response of the skin, predominantly to UV-B. Generally, an individual’s 
ability  to  tolerate  sunlight  is  inversely  proportional  to  that  individu-
al’s  degree  of  melanin  pigmentation.  Melanin,  a  complex  polymer  of 
tyrosine derivatives, is synthesized in specialized epidermal dendritic 
cells known as melanocytes and is packaged into melanosomes that are 
transferred via dendritic processes into keratinocytes, thereby provid-
ing photoprotection (dissipating the vast majority of absorbed UVR in 
the skin) and simultaneously darkening the skin. Sun-induced mela-
nogenesis is a consequence of increased tyrosinase activity in melano-
cytes.  Central  to  the  suntan  response  is  the  melanocortin-1  receptor 
(MC1R), and mutations in this gene contribute to the wide variation 
in human skin and hair color; individuals with red hair and fair skin 
typically have low MC1R activity. In the skin, there are two main types 
of  melanin:  eumelanin  (providing  brown  and  black  pigmentation 
associated with high MC1R activity) and pheomelanin (providing red 
pigmentation  associated  with  low  MC1R  activity).  Pheomelanin  is  a 
cysteine-containing red polymer of benzothiazine units and has much 
weaker shielding capacity against UVR compared to eumelanin. This 

may explain why individuals with a higher proportion of pheomelanin 
(red  hair/fair  skin  appearance)  have  an  increased  risk  of  melanoma 
formation.  In  addition,  pheomelanin  may  also  promote  melanoma 
formation  through  induction  of  oxidative  damage  by  amplifying 
UV-A–induced ROS but also through UVR-independent mechanisms.
The human MC1R gene encodes a G protein–coupled receptor that 
binds α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which is secreted 
in  the  skin  mainly  by  keratinocytes  in  response  to  UVR.  The  UV- 
induced  expression  of  this  hormone  is  controlled  by  the  tumor  sup-
pressor  p53,  and  absence  of  functional  p53  attenuates  the  tanning 
response.  Activation  of  the  melanocortin  receptor  leads  to  increased 
intracellular  cyclic  adenosine  5′-monophosphate  (cAMP)  and  pro-
tein  kinase  A  activation,  resulting  in  an  increased  transcription  of 
the  microphthalmia-associated  transcription  factor  (MITF),  which 
stimulates  melanogenesis.  Since  the  precursor  of  α-MSH,  proopi-
omelanocortin  produced  by  keratinocytes,  is  also  the  precursor  of 
β-endorphins, UVR may result in not only increased pigmentation but 
also increased β-endorphin production in the skin, an effect that has 
been hypothesized to promote sun-seeking behaviors and even mediate 
addiction to tanning.

The  Fitzpatrick  classification  of  human  skin  phototypes  is  based 
on the efficiency of the epidermal-melanin unit, which usually can be 
ascertained  by  asking  an  individual  two  questions:  (1)  Do  you  burn 
after sun exposure? (2) Do you tan after sun exposure? The answers to 
these questions permit division of the population into six skin types, 
varying from type I (always burn, never tan) to type VI (never burn, 
always tan) (Table 61-1).

Sunburn  erythema  is  due  to  vasodilation  of  dermal  blood  vessels. 
There  is  a  lag  time  (usually  4–12  h)  between  skin  exposure  to  sun-
light and the development of visible redness. The action spectrum for 
sunburn erythema includes UV-B and UV-A, although UV-B is much 
more  efficient  than  UV-A  in  evoking  the  response.  However,  UV-A 
may  contribute  to  sunburn  erythema  at  midday,  when  much  more 
UV-A than UV-B is present in the solar spectrum. The erythema that 
accompanies the inflammatory response induced by UVR results from 
the orchestrated release of cytokines along with growth factors and the 
generation  of  ROS.  Furthermore,  UV-induced  activation  of  nuclear 
factor κB–dependent gene transcription can augment release of several 
proinflammatory cytokines and vasoactive mediators. These cytokines 
and  mediators  accumulate  locally  in  sunburned  skin,  providing  che-
motactic factors that attract neutrophils, macrophages, and T lympho-
cytes, which promote the inflammatory response. UVR also stimulates 
infiltration of inflammatory cells through induced expression of adhe-
sion molecules such as E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule 
1  on  endothelial  cells  and  keratinocytes.  UVR  has  been  shown  to 
activate  phospholipase  A2,  resulting  in  increases  in  eicosanoids  such 
as prostaglandin E2, which is known to be a potent inducer of sunburn 
erythema. The role of eicosanoids in this reaction has been verified by 
studies showing that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
can reduce sunburn erythema.

Epidermal  changes  in  sunburn  include  the  induction  of  “sunburn 
cells,” which are keratinocytes undergoing p53-dependent apoptosis as 
a defense, with elimination of cells that harbor UV-B–induced struc-
tural DNA damage.

converting it to pre–vitamin D3, which then undergoes temperature- 
dependent isomerization to form the stable hormone vitamin D3. This 
compound  diffuses  to  the  dermal  vasculature  and  circulates  to  the 
liver and kidney, where it is converted to the dihydroxylated functional 
hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Vitamin D metabolites from the 
circulation and those produced in the skin itself can augment epider-
mal  differentiation  signaling  and  inhibit  keratinocyte  proliferation. 
These effects are exploited therapeutically in psoriasis with the topical 
application of synthetic vitamin D analogues. In addition, vitamin D is 
increasingly thought to have beneficial effects in several other inflam-
matory conditions, and some evidence suggests that—besides its classic 
physiologic effects on calcium metabolism and bone homeostasis—it is 
associated with a reduced risk of various internal malignancies. There 
is  controversy  regarding  the  risk-to-benefit  ratio  of  sun  exposure  for 
vitamin D homeostasis. At present, it is important to emphasize that 
no clear-cut evidence suggests that the use of sunscreens substantially 
diminishes  vitamin  D  levels.  Since  aging  also  substantially  decreases 
the ability of human skin to photocatalytically produce vitamin D3, the 
widespread use of sunscreens that filter out UV-B has led to concerns 
that the elderly might be unduly susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. 
However, the amount of sunlight needed to produce sufficient vitamin 
D is small and does not justify the risks of skin cancer and other types 
of photodamage linked to increased sun exposure or tanning behavior. 
Nutritional supplementation of vitamin D is a preferable strategy for 
patients with vitamin D deficiency.
Chronic Effects of Sun Exposure: Nonmalignant  The clinical 
features of photoaging (dermatoheliosis) consist of wrinkling, blotchiness, 
and  telangiectasia,  as  well  as  a  roughened,  irregular,  “weather-beaten” 
leathery appearance.

UVR  is  important  in  the  pathogenesis  of  photoaging  in  human 
skin, and ROS are likely involved. The dermis and its connective tis-
sue  matrix  are  major  targets  for  sun-associated  chronic  damage  that 
manifests as solar elastosis, a massive increase in thickened irregular 
masses  of  abnormal-appearing  elastic  fibers.  Collagen  fibers  are  also 
abnormally clumped in the deeper dermis of sun-damaged skin. The 
chromophores, the action spectra, and the specific biochemical events 
orchestrating  these  changes  are  only  partially  understood,  although 
more  deeply  penetrating  UV-A  seems  to  be  primarily  involved. 
Chronologically  aged  sun-protected  skin  and  photoaged  skin  share 
important  molecular  features,  including  connective  tissue  damage 
and  elevated  levels  of  matrix  metalloproteinases  (MMPs).  MMPs  are 
enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix. UV-A 
induces  expression  of  some  MMPs,  including  MMP-1  and  MMP-3, 
leading to increased collagen breakdown. In addition, UV-A reduces 
type I procollagen messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Thus, chronic 
UVR  alters  the  structure  and  function  of  dermal  collagen  both  by 
inhibiting its synthesis and enhancing its breakdown. Based on these 
observations,  it  is  not  surprising  that  high-dose  UV-A  phototherapy 
may  have  beneficial  effects  in  some  patients  with  localized  fibrotic 
diseases of the skin, such as localized scleroderma.
Chronic  Effects  of  Sun  Exposure:  Malignant  One  of  the 
major  known  consequences  of  chronic  excessive  skin  exposure  to 
sunlight  is  NMSC,  including  SCCs,  BCCs  and  MCCs  (Chap.  76).  A 
model for skin cancer induction involves three major steps: initiation, 
promotion,  and  progression.  Exposure  of  human  skin  to  sunlight 
results in initiation, a step by which structural (mutagenic) changes in 
DNA  evoke  an  irreversible  alteration  in  the  target  cell  (keratinocyte) 
that  begins  the  tumorigenic  process.  Exposure  to  a  tumor  initiator 
such as UV-B is believed to be a necessary but not a sufficient step in 
the malignant process, since initiated skin cells not exposed to tumor 
promoters  generally  do  not  develop  into  tumors.  The  second  stage 
in  tumor  development  is  promotion,  a  multistep  process  by  which 
chronic  exposure  to  sunlight  evokes  further  changes  that  culminate 
in the clonal expansion of initiated cells and cause the development of 
premalignant growths known as actinic keratoses, which may progress 
to form SCCs. As a result of extensive studies, it seems clear that UV-B 
is a complete carcinogen, meaning that it can act as both a tumor initi-
ator and a tumor promoter. The third and final step in the malignant 

process  is  malignant  conversion  of  benign  precursors  into  cancers,  a 
process thought to enhance genetic instability.

On a molecular level, skin carcinogenesis results from the accumu-
lation of gene mutations that cause inactivation of tumor suppressors, 
activation of oncogenes, or reactivation of cellular signaling pathways 
that normally are expressed only during embryologic epidermal devel-
opment  that  drive  cell  proliferation.  Interestingly,  a  large  number  of 
UV-induced oncogenic driver mutations that are present in SCCs can 
already be found in aged sun-exposed normal skin, leading to a growth 
advantage  and  innumerable  precancerous  clones  carrying  cancer-
causing mutations. These mutations occur particularly often in genes 
that affect proliferation of epidermal stem cells (e.g., NOTCH receptor 
genes). The pattern of oncogenic gene mutations in aged sun-exposed 
skin shows considerable overlap with the mutations identified in SCCs, 
while there is little overlap with the mutations identified in BCCs or 
melanomas. For example, ∼20% of normal aged sun-exposed skin cells 
and ∼60% of SCCs carry driver mutations in NOTCH1. Additionally, 
the  accumulation  of  mutations  in  the  tumor-suppressor  gene  p53 
can  also  promote  skin  carcinogenesis.  Indeed,  the  majority  of  both 
human and murine UV-induced skin cancers have characteristic UVR- 
induced  p53  mutations  (C  →  T  and  CC  →  TT  transitions).  Studies 
in mice have shown that sunscreens can substantially reduce the fre-
quency of these signature mutations in p53 and inhibit the induction 
of tumors. The comparison of UVR-induced gene mutations between 
aged  sun-exposed  normal  skin  and  SCCs  supports  the  hypothesis  of 
a  progressive  accumulation  of  additional  oncogenic  mutations  that 
eventually  lead  to  the  transition  from  precancerous  cell  clones  to 
SCCs. It has been estimated that SCCs harbor ∼10 times more onco-
genic driver mutations per cell than cells in aged sun-exposed normal 
skin. Furthermore, while aged sun-exposed skin and SCCs carry sim-
ilar UVR-induced mutations in p53 or NOTCH receptors, oncogenic 
mutations in other genes (e.g., CDKN2A) were mainly found in SCCs 
and not in aged sun-exposed skin, which are thus likely to play a criti-
cal role in malignant progression.

Compared  to  SCCs,  BCCs  carry  a  distinct  mutational  profile  in 
specific  genes.  BCCs  harbor  inactivating  mutations  particularly  in 
the  tumor-suppressor  gene  patched  or  activating  mutations  in  the 
oncogene  smoothened,  which  result  in  the  constitutive  activation  of 
the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway and increased cell proliferation. 
There is also evidence linking alterations in the Wnt/β-catenin signal-
ing pathway, which is known to be critical for hair follicle development, 
to skin cancer as well. Thus, interactions between this pathway and the 
hedgehog  signaling  pathway  appear  to  be  involved  in  both  skin  car-
cinogenesis and embryologic development of the skin and hair follicles.
Clonal analysis in mouse models of BCC revealed that tumor cells 
arise  from  stem  cells  of  the  interfollicular  epidermis  and  the  upper 
infundibulum  of  the  hair  follicle.  These  BCC-initiating  cells  are 
reprogrammed to resemble embryonic hair follicle progenitors, whose 
tumor-initiating  ability  depends  on  activation  of  the  Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling pathway.

SCC  initiation  occurs  both  in  the  interfollicular  epidermis  and  in 
the  hair  follicle  bulge  stem  cell  populations.  In  mouse  models,  the 
combination of mutant K-Ras and p53 is sufficient to induce invasive 
SCCs from these cell populations.

The transcription factor Myc is important for stem cell maintenance 
in the skin, and oncogenic activation of Myc has been implicated in the 
development of BCCs and SCCs.

The third NMSC is MCC, which is named after its resemblance to 
Merkel cells in the skin. The incidence of MCCs has been increasing in 
recent years for unknown reasons. The age-adjusted global incidence 
is about 1 in 100,000. Just like SCC and BCC, patients with MCCs are 
usually  fair-skinned  males  in  the  sixth  to  eighth  decades  of  life  who 
are living in geographic regions with greater solar UVR. These tumors 
occur predominantly on the head and neck in older individuals and on 
the trunk in younger people. MCCs also have a higher incidence among 
immunosuppressed patients. MCCs are aggressive and life-threatening, 
poorly  differentiated  neuroendocrine  carcinomas.  Overall  survival 
at  5  years  is  around  50%  for  local  disease,  35%  for  nodal  disease, 
and 15% for metastatic disease. While the majority of MCCs present

420

locally,  nodal  and  metastatic  disease  can  occur  simultaneously.  The 
pathogenesis  of  MCCs  is  closely  connected  to  the  Merkel  cell  poly-
oma  virus  (MCPyV).  It  is  now  recognized  that  MCCs  can  either  be 
MCPyV  positive  or  MCPyV  negative.  MCPyV-negative  MCCs  man-
ifest high levels of classic UV-induced signature mutations (C to T or 
CC  to  TT)  and  inactivation  of  tumor  suppressor  genes,  which  could 
explain  the  growth  of  these  viral-negative  lesions.  MCPyV-positive 
tumors are thought to grow secondary to viral integration into the host 
genome and acquisition of a truncating mutation of the large T antigen 
that  results  in  the  production  of  viral  oncoproteins.  The  growth  of 
MCPyV-positive  tumors  may  be  further  promoted  by  UVR-induced 
local immunosuppression. Both forms of MCC are immunogenic, and 
metastatic  MCC  has  been  treated  in  some  patients  successfully  with 
PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.

In summary, NMSC involves mutations and alterations in multiple 
genes and pathways that occur as a result of their chronic accumulation 
driven by exposure to environmental factors such as solar UVR.

Epidemiologic  studies  have  linked  excessive  sun  exposure  to  an 
increased risk of NMSCs and melanoma of the skin; the evidence is far 
more direct for NMSCs (BCCs, SCCs, and MCCs) than for melanoma. 
Approximately  80%  of  NMSCs  develop  on  sun-exposed  body  areas, 
including  the  face,  neck,  and  hands.  Major  risk  factors  include  male 
sex, childhood sun exposures, older age, fair skin, and residence at lati-
tudes relatively close to the equator. Individuals with darker-pigmented 
skin have a lower risk of skin cancer than do fair-skinned individuals. 
More than 2 million individuals in the United States develop NMSC 
annually,  and  the  lifetime  risk  that  a  fair-skinned  individual  will 
develop such a neoplasm is estimated at ∼15%. The incidence of NMSC 
in the population is increasing at a rate of 2–3% per year, likely due to 
earlier detection and increased opportunities for outdoor activities.

The relationship of sun exposure to melanoma development is less 
direct,  but  strong  evidence  supports  an  association.  Clear-cut  risk 
factors include a positive family or personal history of melanoma and 
multiple  dysplastic  nevi.  Melanomas  can  occur  during  adolescence; 
the  implication  is  that  the  latent  period  for  tumor  growth  is  shorter 
than  that  for  NMSC.  For  reasons  that  are  only  partially  understood, 
melanomas are among the most rapidly increasing human malignan-
cies  (Chap.  76).  One  potential  explanation  is  the  widespread  use  of 
indoor tanning. It is estimated that 30 million people tan indoors in the 
United States annually, including >2 million adolescents. Furthermore, 
epidemiologic studies suggest that life in a sunny climate from birth or 
early  childhood  may  increase  the  risk  of  melanoma  development.  In 
general, risk does not correlate with cumulative sun exposure but may 
be related to the duration and extent of exposure in childhood.

However, in contrast to NMSCs, melanoma frequently develops in 
non–sun-exposed  skin,  and  oncogenic  mutations  in  melanoma  may 
also not be UVR-signature mutations. These observations suggest that 
UVR-independent factors may contribute to melanomagenesis, which 
is consistent with findings in mouse models showing that pheomelanin 
is less efficient in protecting against melanoma than is eumelanin and 
may promote melanoma through UVR-independent mechanisms.

Importantly, mutations in BRAF and NRAS that lead to activation 
of a growth-promoting signaling cascade are frequently found in mela-
noma (but not in SCCs or BCCs), which has led to the development of 
specific inhibitors of this pathway for the treatment of BRAF-mutant 
melanoma.  However,  a  high  mutational  load  in  melanoma  may  not 
be  equated  with  a  more  unfavorable  prognosis.  Tumor-specific  mis-
sense mutations in melanomas can result in neoantigens that facilitate 
an  immune  response  to  the  tumor  cell.  A  major  advance  in  treating 
melanoma, termed immune checkpoint blockade, targets inhibitors of 
cytotoxic  T  effector  function.  For  example,  the  PD-1/PD-L1  interac-
tion inhibits tumor cell apoptosis, promotes peripheral T effector cell 
exhaustion,  and  induces  conversion  of  T  effector  cells  to  regulatory 
T  cells.  Checkpoint  inhibitor  treatment  (e.g.,  with  antibodies  that 
inhibit  PD-1  or  PD-L1)  disrupts  this  interaction  and  has  resulted 
in  a  durable  and  potent  immune  destruction  of  melanoma  cells  in 
a  subset  of  patients,  leading  to  prolonged  survival  of  patients  with 
locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. It has recently been shown 
that  a  high  mutational  load  in  melanomas  correlates  with  improved 

therapeutic outcome to immune checkpoint blockade, consistent with 
the hypothesis that acquired missense mutations in the tumor cells lead 
to neoantigens that increase the vulnerability of these melanoma cells 
to attack by activated T cells.
GLOBAL  CONSIDERATIONS  The  frequency  of  skin  cancer  shows 
strong geographic variation, depending on the skin phototype of the 
majority of the population in these geographic areas, but also depend-
ing on the intensity of UVR. For example, both melanoma and NMSCs 
are particularly common in Australia.

Photoimmunology  Exposure to solar radiation causes both local 
and  systemic  immunosuppression  and  involves  both  the  innate  and 
adaptive  immune  systems.  Local  immunosuppression  is  defined  as 
inhibition  of  immune  responses  to  antigens  applied  at  the  irradiated 
site, whereas systemic immunosuppression is defined as inhibition of 
immune responses to antigens applied at remote, unirradiated sites. An 
example of local immunosuppression is that human skin exposure to 
modest  doses  of  UV-B  can  deplete  the  epidermal  antigen-presenting 
Langerhans cells, thereby reducing the degree of allergic sensitization 
to topical application of the potent contact allergen dinitrochloroben-
zene  at  the  irradiated  skin  site.  An  example  of  the  systemic  immu-
nosuppressive  effects  of  higher  doses  of  UVR  is  the  diminished 
immunologic response to antigens introduced either epicutaneously or 
intracutaneously at sites remote from the irradiated site.

The  major  chromophores  in  the  upper  epidermis  that  are  known 
to  initiate  UV-mediated  immunosuppression  include  DNA,  trans- 
urocanic  acid,  and  membrane  components.  The  action  spectrum 
for  UV-induced  immunosuppression  closely  mimics  the  absorption 
spectrum  of  DNA.  UVR-induced  cyclobutane  pyrimidine  dimers  in 
Langerhans  cells  may  inhibit  antigen  presentation.  The  absorption 
spectrum of epidermal urocanic acid closely mimics the action spec-
trum for UV-B–induced immunosuppression. Urocanic acid is a meta-
bolic product of the essential amino acid histidine and accumulates in 
the upper epidermis through breakdown of the histidine-rich protein 
filaggrin  due  to  the  absence  of  its  catabolizing  enzyme  in  keratino-
cytes. Urocanic acid is synthesized as a trans-isomer, and UV-induced 
trans-cis isomerization of urocanic acid in the stratum corneum drives 
immunosuppression. Cis-urocanic acid may exert its immunosuppres-
sive  effects  through  a  variety  of  mechanisms,  including  inhibition  of 
antigen presentation by Langerhans cells.

Various  additional  immunomodulatory  factors  and  cytokines 
have been implicated in UVR-induced systemic immunosuppression, 
including  tumor  necrosis  factor-α,  interleukin  4  (IL-4),  interleu-
kin  10  (IL-10),  and  eicosanoids.  Keratinocytes  can  release  multiple 
immunomodulators  as  a  response  to  UVR-induced  cell  damage  that 
result  in  an  immunosuppressive  environment.  Induction  of  IL-4– 
producing natural killer T cells and of regulatory T cells and B cells has 
been  linked  to  cell-mediated  and  humoral  immunosuppression  as  a 
consequence of UVR damage to skin. Moreover, UVR-induced forma-
tion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from necrotic 
keratinocytes can lead to a type I interferon innate immune response 
via activation of Toll-like receptor signaling.

One important consequence of chronic sun exposure and associated 
immunosuppression is an enhanced risk of skin cancer. In part, UV-B 
activates regulatory T cells that suppress antitumor immune responses 
via IL-10 expression, whereas in the absence of high UV-B exposure, 
epidermal  Langerhans  cells  present  tumor-associated  antigens  and 
induce  protective  immunity,  thereby  inhibiting  skin  tumorigenesis. 
UV-induced DNA damage is a major molecular trigger of this immu-
nosuppressive effect.

Perhaps  the  most  graphic  demonstration  of  the  role  of  long-term 
immunosuppression in enhancing the risk of NMSC comes from studies 
of organ transplant recipients who require lifelong immunosuppressive/
antirejection drug regimens. More than 50% of organ transplant recip-
ients  develop  BCCs  and  SCCs,  and  these  skin  cancers  are  the  most 
common  types  of  malignancies  arising  in  these  patients.  The  impor-
tant contributory role of UVR for the formation of these skin cancers 
in  immunosuppressed  individuals  is  highlighted  by  the  observation 
that nonwhite transplant recipients develop these skin cancers far less 

HPIM21e_Part2_p091-p464.indd   420

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesoften than white transplant recipients. Rates of BCC and SCC increase 
with  the  duration  and  degree  of  immunosuppression.  Transplant 
recipients ideally should be screened prior to organ transplantation, be 
monitored closely thereafter, and adhere to rigorous photoprotection 
measures,  including  the  use  of  sunscreens  and  protective  clothing  as 
well as sun avoidance. Notably, immunosuppressive drugs that target 
the  mTOR  pathway,  such  as  sirolimus  and  everolimus,  may  reduce 
the  risk  of  NMSC  in  organ  transplant  recipients  compared  to  that 
associated  with  the  use  of  calcineurin  inhibitors  (cyclosporine  and 
tacrolimus).  The  latter  may  contribute  to  NMSC  formation  not  only 
through their immunosuppressive effects but also through suppression 
of p53-dependent cancer cell senescence pathways independent of host 
immunity.

Whereas  the  immunosuppressive  effects  of  UVR  contribute  to 
skin cancer, UVR can also exacerbate autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases  of  the  skin,  including  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE). 
It has been proposed that in SLE UVR-induced damage to DNA may 
promote autoantibody formation.

 ■ PHOTOSENSITIVITY DISEASES
The  diagnosis  of  photosensitivity  requires  elicitation  of  a  careful 
history  to  define  the  duration  of  signs  and  symptoms,  the  length  of 
time between exposure to sunlight and the development of subjective 
symptoms and visible changes in the skin. The age of onset can also 
be a helpful diagnostic clue. For example, the acute photosensitivity of 
erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) almost always begins in infancy 
or early childhood, whereas the chronic photosensitivity of porphyria 
cutanea tarda (PCT) typically begins in the fourth and fifth decades of 
life. A patient’s history of exposure to topical and systemic drugs and 
chemicals  may  provide  important  diagnostic  clues.  Many  classes  of 
drugs  can  cause  photosensitivity  on  the  basis  of  either  phototoxicity 
or photoallergy.

Examination of the skin may offer important clues. Anatomic areas 
that  are  naturally  protected  from  direct  sunlight,  such  as  the  hairy 
scalp, the upper eyelids, the retroauricular areas, and the infranasal and 
submental regions, may be spared, whereas exposed areas show charac-
teristic features of the pathologic process. These anatomic localization 
patterns are often helpful, but not infallible, in making the diagnosis. 
For example, airborne contact sensitizers that are blown onto the skin 
may produce dermatitis that can be difficult to distinguish from photo-
sensitivity despite the fact that such material may trigger skin reactivity 
in areas shielded from direct sunlight.

Many  dermatologic  conditions  may  be  caused  or  aggravated  by 
sunlight (Table 61-2). The role of light in evoking these responses may 
be  dependent  on  genetic  abnormalities  ranging  from  well-described 
defects  in  DNA  repair  that  occur  in  xeroderma  pigmentosum  to 
the  inherited  abnormalities  in  heme  synthesis  that  characterize  the 
porphyrias.

Polymorphous  Light  Eruption  The  most  common  type  of 
photosensitivity disease is polymorphous light eruption (PMLE). Many 
affected individuals may never seek medical attention because the con-
dition is often transient, becoming manifest in the spring with initial 
sun exposure but then subsiding spontaneously with continuing expo-
sure, a phenomenon known as “hardening.” The major manifestations 
of PMLE include (often intensely) pruritic erythematous papules that 
may  coalesce  into  plaques  in  a  patchy  distribution  on  exposed  areas 
of the trunk and forearms. The face is usually less affected. Whereas 
the  morphologic  skin  findings  remain  similar  for  each  patient  with 
subsequent  recurrences,  significant  interindividual  variations  in  skin 
findings are characteristic (hence the term polymorphous).

A skin biopsy and phototest procedures in which skin is exposed to 
multiple erythemal doses of UV-A and UV-B may aid in the diagnosis. 
The action spectrum for PMLE is usually within these portions of the 
solar spectrum.

Whereas the treatment of an acute flare of PMLE may require top-
ical  or  systemic  glucocorticoids,  approaches  to  preventing  PMLE  are 
important and include the use of high-SPF broad-spectrum sunscreens 
as well as the induction of “hardening” by the cautious administration

of artificial UV-B (broad-band or narrow-band) and/or UV-A radia-
tion or the use of psoralen plus UV-A (PUVA) photochemotherapy for 
∼4 weeks before initial sun exposure. Such prophylactic phototherapy 
or  photochemotherapy  at  the  beginning  of  spring  may  prevent  the 
occurrence of PMLE throughout the summer.

Actinic  prurigo  is  a  photo-induced  pruritic  eruption  that  shares 
similarities with PMLE and often occurs in the spring; however, it can 
persist throughout the summer and extend into the winter months.

Phototoxicity  and  Photoallergy  These  photosensitivity  dis-
orders  are  related  to  the  topical  or  systemic  administration  of  drugs 
and  other  chemicals  that  can  act  as  chromophores.  Both  reactions 
require  the  absorption  of  energy  by  a  drug  or  chemical  with  conse-
quent production of an excited-state photosensitizer that can transfer 
its absorbed energy to a bystander molecule or to molecular oxygen, 
thereby generating tissue-destructive chemical species, including ROS.
Phototoxicity  is  a  nonimmunologic  reaction  that  can  be  caused 
by  a  broad  range  of  drugs  and  chemicals,  some  of  which  are  listed 
in  Table  61-3.  The  usual  clinical  manifestations  include  erythema

resembling  a  sunburn  reaction  that  quickly  desquamates,  or  “peels,” 
within  several  days.  In  addition,  edema,  vesicles,  and  bullae  may 
occur.  A  common  phototoxic  reaction  that  occurs  after  contact  with 
plant-derived furocoumarins and exposure to UV-A radiation is called 
phytophotodermatitis.

Photoallergy  is  much  less  common  and  is  distinct  in  that  it  is  an 
immunopathologic  process.  The  excited-state  photosensitizer  may 
create  highly  unstable  haptenic  free  radicals  that  bind  covalently  to 
macromolecules to form a functional antigen (photoallergen) capable 
of  evoking  a  delayed-type  hypersensitivity  response.  Most  photoal-
lergic  reactions  are  initiated  by  UV-A  rather  than  UV-B  exposure. 
Some  drugs  and  chemicals  that  can  produce  photoallergy  are  listed 
in Table 61-4. The clinical manifestations typically differ from those 
of  phototoxicity  in  that  an  intensely  pruritic  eczematous  dermatitis 
tends  to  predominate  and  evolves  into  lichenified,  thickened,  “leath-
ery” changes in sun-exposed areas. A small subset (perhaps 5–10%) of 
patients  with  photoallergy  may  develop  a  persistent  exquisite  hyper-
sensitivity to light even when the offending drug or chemical is iden-
tified and eliminated, a condition known as persistent light reaction.

An  uncommon  type  of  persistent  photosensitivity  is  known  as 
chronic  actinic  dermatitis.  The  affected  patients  are  typically  elderly 
men  with  a  long  history  of  preexisting  allergic  contact  dermatitis 
or  photosensitivity.  Common  photoallergens  associated  with  this 
condition  are  sunscreen  ingredients  and  plant  photoallergens.  These 
individuals are usually exquisitely sensitive to UV-B, UV-A, and visible 
wavelengths.

Phototoxicity and photoallergy often can be diagnostically confirmed 
by  phototest  procedures.  In  patients  with  suspected  phototoxicity,

determining  the  minimal  erythemal  dose  (MED)  while  the  patient 
is  exposed  to  a  suspected  agent  and  then  repeating  the  MED  after 
discontinuation of the agent may provide a clue to the causative drug 
or chemical. Photopatch testing can be performed to confirm the diag-
nosis of photoallergy. In this simple variant of ordinary patch testing, 
a  series  of  known  photoallergens  is  applied  to  the  skin  in  duplicate, 
and  one  set  is  irradiated  with  a  suberythemal  dose  of  UV-A.  The 
development of eczematous changes at sites exposed to sensitizer and 
light is a positive result. The characteristic abnormality in patients with 
persistent light reaction is a diminished threshold to erythema evoked 
by  UV-B.  Patients  with  chronic  actinic  dermatitis  usually  manifest  a 
broad  spectrum  of  UV  hyperresponsiveness  and  require  meticulous 
photoprotection, including avoidance of sun exposure, use of high-SPF 
(>30) sunscreens, and, in severe cases, systemic immunosuppression, 
such as with azathioprine.

The  management  of  drug  photosensitivity  involves  first  and  fore-
most the elimination of exposure to the chemical agents responsible for 
the reaction and the minimization of sun exposure. The acute symp-
toms of phototoxicity may be ameliorated by cool moist compresses, 
topical  glucocorticoids,  and  systemically  administered  NSAIDs.  In 
severely affected individuals, a tapered course of systemic glucocorti-
coids may be useful. Judicious use of analgesics may be necessary.

Photoallergic  reactions  require  a  similar  management  approach. 
Furthermore, patients with persistent light reaction and chronic actinic 
dermatitis  must  be  meticulously  protected  against  light  exposure.  In 
selected patients to whom chronic systemic high-dose glucocorticoids 
pose unacceptable risks, it may be necessary to employ an immunosup-
pressive  drug  such  as  azathioprine,  cyclophosphamide,  cyclosporine, 
or mycophenolate mofetil.

Porphyria  The porphyrias (Chap. 416) are a group of diseases that 
have in common inherited or acquired derangements in the synthesis 
of heme. Heme is an iron-chelated tetrapyrrole or porphyrin, and only 
the  nonmetal  chelated  porphyrins  are  potent  photosensitizers  that 
absorb  light  intensely  in  both  the  short  (400–410  nm)  and  the  long 
(580–650 nm) portions of the visible spectrum.

Heme  cannot  be  reutilized  and  must  be  synthesized  continuously. 
The two body compartments with the largest capacity for its produc-
tion  are  the  bone  marrow  and  the  liver.  Accordingly,  the  porphyrias 
originate  in  one  or  the  other  of  these  organs,  with  an  end  result  of 
excessive  endogenous  production  of  potent  photosensitizing  por-
phyrins.  The  porphyrins  circulate  in  the  bloodstream  and  diffuse 
into  the  skin,  where  they  absorb  solar  energy,  become  photoexcited, 
generate ROS, and evoke cutaneous photosensitivity. The mechanism 
of  porphyrin  photosensitization  is  known  to  be  photodynamic,  or 
oxygen-dependent, and is mediated by ROS such as singlet oxygen and 
superoxide anions.

The group of cutaneous porphyrias can be classified as causing either 
(1) chronic blistering photosensitivity or (2) acute nonblistering photo-
sensitivity. Chronic cutaneous porphyrias include PCT, congenital ery-
thropoietic  porphyria  (CEP),  hepatoerythropoietic  porphyria  (HEP), 
hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and variegate porphyria (VP). CEP, 
HEP, and PCT manifest only with cutaneous symptoms, while HCP and 
VP have acute neurovisceral symptoms in addition to the skin photo-
sensitivity. Acute cutaneous nonblistering porphyrias include EPP and 
X-linked  protoporphyria  (XLP).  Representative  examples  of  chronic 
and acute cutaneous porphyrias are discussed below.

Porphyria  cutanea  tarda  (PCT)  is  the  most  common  type  of  por-
phyria and is associated with decreased activity of the heme pathway 
enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) to <20% of normal. 
Increased iron and various acquired factors (e.g., alcohol consumption, 
estrogens, smoking, hepatitis C or HIV infection) can reduce UROD 
activity. There are two basic types of PCT: (1) the sporadic or acquired 
type, generally seen in individuals ingesting ethanol or receiving estro-
gens; and (2) the inherited type, in which there is autosomal dominant 
transmission of deficient enzyme activity (resulting in heterozygosity 
for UROD with a reduction to 50% of UROD enzymatic activity and, 
thus, predisposing the individual to PCT). Both forms are associated 
with increased hepatic iron stores.

In both types of PCT, the predominant feature is chronic photosen-
sitivity characterized by increased fragility of sun-exposed skin, partic-
ularly areas subject to repeated trauma such as the dorsa of the hands, 
the  forearms,  the  face,  and  the  ears.  The  predominant  skin  lesions 
are  vesicles  and  bullae  that  rupture,  producing  moist  erosions  (often 
with a hemorrhagic base) that heal slowly, with crusting and purplish 
discoloration of the affected skin. Hypertrichosis, mottled pigmentary 
change,  and  scleroderma-like  induration  are  associated  features.  The 
diagnosis can be confirmed biochemically by measurement of urinary 
porphyrin excretion, plasma porphyrin assay, and assay of erythrocyte 
and/or  hepatic  UROD.  Multiple  mutations  of  the  UROD  gene  have 
been identified in human populations. Some patients with PCT have 
associated mutations in the HFE gene, which is linked to hemochro-
matosis and leads to increased iron absorption by reducing hepcidin 
expression;  these  mutations  could  contribute  to  the  iron  overload 
precipitating PCT, although iron status as measured by serum ferritin, 
iron levels, and transferrin saturation is no different from that in PCT 
patients without HFE mutations.

Treatment  of  PCT  consists  of  repeated  phlebotomies  to  diminish 
the  excessive  hepatic  iron  stores  and/or  intermittent  (twice  weekly) 
low doses of orally administered hydroxychloroquine. This treatment 
is highly effective for PCT but not suited for treatment of other porphy-
rias. Long-term remission of the disease can often be achieved if the 
patient eliminates exposure to porphyrinogenic agents, such as ethanol 
or estrogens, and avoids sun exposure.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is an acute nonblistering cuta-
neous porphyria, originates in the bone marrow, and is due to genetic 
mutations that in most cases decrease the activity of the mitochondrial 
enzyme ferrochelatase. The major clinical features include acute pho-
tosensitivity characterized by painful burning and stinging of exposed 
skin that often develops during or just after sun exposure. There may 
be  associated  skin  swelling  and,  after  repeated  episodes,  a  waxlike 
scarring.

Detection  of  increased  plasma  protoporphyrin  (PROTO)  helps 
distinguish  EPP  from  lead  poisoning  and  iron-deficiency  anemia,  in 
both of which erythrocyte PROTO levels are elevated in the absence 
of  cutaneous  photosensitivity.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that 
metal-chelated PROTO is not a photosensitizer.

Rigorous sunlight protection is essential in the management of EPP. 
Notably, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 
a synthetic peptide analogue of α-MSH, afamelanotide, in patients with 
EPP.  This  drug  increases  skin  pigmentation  through  melanogenesis, 
and patients receiving it tolerate sun exposure without pain for longer 
periods of time and have an improved quality of life as compared to 
untreated  patients.  Interestingly,  initial  studies  suggest  that  afamel-
anotide  may  also  be  beneficial  when  combined  with  narrow-band 
UV-B in the treatment of patients with vitiligo (in patients with skin 
phototypes IV–VI). Some studies reported that patients with EPP had a 
moderate increase in tolerance to sunlight after taking oral β-carotene, 
which may provide this effect by quenching oxygen free radicals.

An  algorithm  for  managing  patients  with  photosensitivity  is  pre-

sented in Fig. 61-1.

PHOTOPROTECTION
Since photosensitivity of the skin results from exposure to sunlight, it 
follows that absolute avoidance of sunlight will eliminate these disor-
ders. However, contemporary lifestyles make this approach impractical 
for most individuals. Thus, better approaches to photoprotection have 
been  sought.  Natural  photoprotection  is  provided  by  structural  pro-
teins in the epidermis, particularly keratins and melanin. The amount 
of  melanin  and  its  distribution  in  cells  are  genetically  regulated,  and 
individuals of darker complexion (skin types IV–VI) are at decreased 
risk for the development of acute sunburn and cutaneous malignancy. 
Other  forms  of  photoprotection  include  clothing  and  sunscreens. 
Clothing constructed of tightly woven sun-protective fabrics, irrespec-
tive of color, affords substantial protection. Wide-brimmed hats, long 
sleeves, and trousers all reduce direct exposure.

Sunscreens  are  now  considered  over-the-counter  drugs,  and  a 
monograph from the FDA has recognized category I ingredients as safe

and  effective.  Those  ingredients  are  listed  in  Table  61-5.  Sunscreens 
are rated for their photoprotective effect by their sun protection fac-
tor  (SPF).  The  SPF  is  simply  a  ratio  of  the  time  required  to  produce 
sunburn  erythema  with  and  without  sunscreen  application.  The  SPF 
of most sunscreens reflects protection from UV-B but not from UV-A. 
The  FDA  monograph  stipulates  that  sunscreens  must  be  rated  on  a 
scale ranging from minimal (SPF ≥2 and <12) to moderate (SPF ≥12 
and <30) to high (SPF ≥30, labeled as 30+).

Broad-spectrum  sunscreens  contain  both  UV-B–absorbing  and 
UV-A–absorbing  chemicals  (organic  filters).  These  chemicals  absorb 
UVR  and  transfer  the  absorbed  energy  to  surrounding  cells.  Among 
these  sunscreen  ingredients,  cinnamates,  PABA  derivatives,  and  sali-
cylates  absorb  UV-B.  Benzophenones  or  ecamsule  (terephthalylidene 
dicamphor  sulfonic  acid)  offer  protection  against  UV-B  and  UV-A2, 
whereas  avobenzone  protects  mainly  against  UV-A1.  In  contrast, 
physical  UV  blockers  (zinc  oxide  and  titanium  dioxide)  absorb  or 
reflect  UVR  and  offer  broad-spectrum  protection  against  UV-B  and 
UV-A.  In  addition  to  light  absorption,  a  critical  determinant  of  the 
sustained photoprotective effect of sunscreens is their water resistance.

choose the most appropriate phototherapeutic approach for a specific 
dermatologic  disease.  For  example,  narrow-band  UV-B  has  been 
reported in several studies to be as effective as PUVA photochemother-
apy in the treatment of psoriasis but to pose a lower risk of skin cancer 
development than PUVA.

coverage, and water or sweat resistance are recommended for adequate 
sun protection.

Some  degree  of  photoprotection  can  be  achieved  by  limiting  the 
time of sun exposure during the day. Since a large part of an individual’s  
total  lifetime  sun  exposure  may  occur  by  age  18,  it  is  important  to 
educate  parents  and  young  children  about  the  hazards  of  sunlight. 
Eliminating exposure at midday will substantially reduce lifetime UVR 
exposure.

PHOTOTHERAPY AND 
PHOTOCHEMOTHERAPY
UVR can be used therapeutically. The administration of UV-B alone or 
in combination with topically applied agents can induce remissions of 
many dermatologic diseases, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and 
vitiligo. In particular, narrow-band UV-B treatments (with fluorescent 
bulbs emitting radiation at ∼311 nm) have enhanced efficacy over that 
obtained with broad-band UV-B in the treatment of psoriasis.

Photochemotherapy  in  which  topically  applied  or  systemically 
administered psoralens are combined with UV-A (PUVA) is effective 
in treating psoriasis and the early stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
and vitiligo. Psoralens are tricyclic furocoumarins that, when interca-
lated into DNA and exposed to UV-A, form adducts with pyrimidine 
bases and eventually form DNA cross-links. These structural changes 
are thought to decrease DNA synthesis and to be related to the ame-
lioration  of  psoriasis.  Why  PUVA  photochemotherapy  is  effective  in 
cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma  is  only  partially  understood,  but  it  has 
been shown to induce apoptosis of atypical T lymphocyte populations 
in  the  skin.  Consequently,  direct  treatment  of  circulating  atypical 
lymphocytes  by  extracorporeal  photochemotherapy  (photopheresis) 
has been used in Sézary syndrome as well as in other severe systemic 
diseases  with  circulating  atypical  lymphocytes,  such  as  graft-versus-
host disease.

In addition to its effects on DNA, PUVA photochemotherapy stim-
ulates epidermal thickening and melanin synthesis; the latter property, 
together with its anti-inflammatory effects, provides the rationale for 
use of PUVA in the depigmenting disease vitiligo. Oral 8-methoxypso-
ralen and UV-A appear to be most effective in this regard, but as many 
as 100 treatments extending over 12–18 months may be required for 
satisfactory repigmentation.

Not surprisingly, the major side effects of long-term UV-B photo-
therapy and PUVA photochemotherapy mimic those seen in individ-
uals  with  chronic  sun  exposure.  Despite  these  risks,  the  therapeutic 
index of these modalities continues to be excellent. It is important to

62 Interpreting Peripheral 
Blood Smears
Dan L. Longo

Some  of  the  relevant  findings  in  peripheral  blood,  enlarged  lymph 
nodes, and bone marrow are illustrated in this chapter. Systematic his-
tologic examination of the bone marrow and lymph nodes is beyond 
the  scope  of  a  general  medicine  textbook.  However,  every  internist 
should know how to examine a peripheral blood smear.

The  examination  of  a  peripheral  blood  smear  is  one  of  the  most 
informative  exercises  a  physician  can  perform.  Although  advances 
in automated technology have made the examination of a peripheral 
blood smear by a physician seem less important, the technology is not 
a completely satisfactory replacement for a blood smear interpretation 
by a trained medical professional who also knows the patient’s clinical 
history, family history, social history, and physical findings. It is useful 
to ask the laboratory to generate a Wright’s-stained peripheral blood 
smear and examine it.

The best place to examine blood cell morphology is the feathered 
edge  of  the  blood  smear  where  red  cells  lie  in  a  single  layer,  side  by 
side, just barely touching one another but not overlapping. The author’s 
approach is to look at the smallest cellular elements, the platelets, first 
and work his way up in size to red cells and then white cells.

Using an oil immersion lens that magnifies the cells 100-fold, one 
counts the platelets in five to six fields, averages the number per field, 
and multiplies by 20,000 to get a rough estimate of the platelet count. 
The  platelets  are  usually  1–2  μm  in  diameter  and  have  a  blue  gran-
ulated  appearance.  There  is  usually  1  platelet  for  every  20  or  so  red 
cells.  Of  course,  the  automated  counter  is  much  more  accurate,  but 
gross  disparities  between  the  automated  and  manual  counts  should 
be assessed. Large platelets may be a sign of rapid platelet turnover, as 
young platelets are often larger than old ones; alternatively, certain rare 
inherited syndromes can produce large platelets. If the platelet count 
is  low,  the  absence  of  large  (young)  platelets  may  be  an  indicator  of 
marrow production problems. Platelet clumping visible on the smear

can be associated with falsely low automated platelet counts. Clumping 
may  be  caused  by  the  anticoagulant  into  which  the  blood  is  drawn. 
Similarly, neutrophil fragmentation can be a source of falsely elevated 
automated platelet counts. The absence of platelet granules may be an 
artifact of the handling of the blood or may indicate marrow disease 
or a rare congenital anomaly, gray platelet syndrome. Elevated platelet 
counts  usually  signify  a  myeloproliferative  disorder  or  a  reaction  to 
systemic inflammation.

Next one examines the red blood cells. One can gauge their size by 
comparing the red cell to the nucleus of a small lymphocyte. Both are 
normally about 8-μm wide. Red cells that are smaller than the small 
lymphocyte  nucleus  may  be  microcytic;  those  larger  than  the  small 
lymphocyte  nucleus  may  be  macrocytic.  Macrocytic  cells  also  tend 
to  be  more  oval  than  spherical  in  shape  and  are  sometimes  called 
macroovalocytes.  The  automated  mean  corpuscular  volume  (MCV) 
can assist in making a classification. However, some patients may have 
both iron and vitamin B12 deficiency, which will produce an MCV in 
the  normal  range  but  wide  variation  in  red  cell  size.  When  the  red 
cells vary greatly in size, anisocytosis is said to be present. When the 
red cells vary greatly in shape, poikilocytosis is said to be present. The 
electronic  cell  counter  provides  an  independent  assessment  of  vari-
ability in red cell size. It measures the range of red cell volumes and 
reports the results as “red cell distribution width” (RDW). This value 
is calculated from the MCV; thus, cell width is not being measured but 
cell volume is. The term is derived from the curve displaying the fre-
quency of cells at each volume, also called the distribution. The width 
of red cell volume distribution curve is what determines the RDW. The 
RDW is calculated as follows: RDW = (standard deviation of MCV ÷  
mean  MCV)  ×  100.  In  the  presence  of  morphologic  anisocytosis, 
RDW (normally 11–14%) increases to 15–18%. The RDW is useful in 
at  least  two  clinical  settings.  In  patients  with  microcytic  anemia,  the 
differential diagnosis is generally between iron deficiency and thalas-
semia. In thalassemia, the small red cells are generally of uniform size 
with a normal small RDW. In iron deficiency, the size variability and 
the RDW are large. In addition, a large RDW can suggest a dimorphic 
anemia when a chronic atrophic gastritis can produce both vitamin B12 
malabsorption to produce macrocytic anemia and blood loss to pro-
duce iron deficiency. In such settings, RDW is also large. An elevated 
RDW also has been reported as a risk factor for all-cause mortality in 
population-based studies, a finding that is unexplained currently.

After red cell size is assessed, one examines the hemoglobin content 
of the cells. They are either normal in color (normochromic) or pale in 
color (hypochromic). They are never “hyperchromic.” If more than the 
normal amount of hemoglobin is made, the cells get larger—they do 
not become darker. In addition to hemoglobin content, the red cells are 
examined for inclusions. Red cell inclusions are the following:

1.  Basophilic stippling—diffuse fine or coarse blue dots in the red cell 
usually  representing  RNA  residue—especially  common  in  lead 
poisoning

2.  Howell-Jolly  bodies—dense  blue  circular  inclusions  that  represent 
nuclear remnants—their presence implies defective splenic function
3.  Nuclei—red cells may be released or pushed out of the marrow pre-
maturely  before  nuclear  extrusion—often  implies  a  myelophthisic 
process or a vigorous narrow response to anemia, usually hemolytic 
anemia

4.  Parasites—red cell parasites include malaria and babesia (Chap. A6)
5.  Polychromatophilia—the red cell cytoplasm has a bluish hue, reflect-
ing the persistence of ribosomes still actively making hemoglobin in 
a young red cell

Vital  stains  are  necessary  to  see  precipitated  hemoglobin  called 

Heinz bodies.

Red cells can take on a variety of different shapes. All abnormally 
shaped  red  cells  are  poikilocytes.  Small  red  cells  without  the  central 
pallor  are  spherocytes;  they  can  be  seen  in  hereditary  spherocytosis, 
hemolytic  anemias  of  other  causes,  and  clostridial  sepsis.  Dacrocytes 
are  teardrop-shaped  cells  that  can  be  seen  in  hemolytic  anemias, 
severe  iron  deficiency,  thalassemias,  myelofibrosis,  and  myelodys-
plastic  syndromes.  Schistocytes  are  helmet-shaped  cells  that  reflect 

microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or fragmentation on an artificial 
heart valve. Echinocytes are spiculated red cells with the spikes evenly 
spaced; they can represent an artifact of abnormal drying of the blood 
smear or reflect changes in stored blood. They also can be seen in renal 
failure  and  malnutrition  and  are  often  reversible.  Acanthocytes  are 
spiculated red cells with the spikes irregularly distributed. This process 
tends  to  be  irreversible  and  reflects  underlying  renal  disease,  abetal-
ipoproteinemia,  or  splenectomy.  Elliptocytes  are  elliptical-shaped  red 
cells that can reflect an inherited defect in the red cell membrane, but 
they also are seen in iron deficiency, myelodysplastic syndromes, meg-
aloblastic anemia, and thalassemias. Stomatocytes are red cells in which 
the area of central pallor takes on the morphology of a slit instead of 
the usual round shape. Stomatocytes can indicate an inherited red cell 
membrane defect and also can be seen in alcoholism. Target cells have 
an area of central pallor that contains a dense center, or bull’s eye. These 
cells are seen classically in thalassemia, but they are also present in iron 
deficiency,  cholestatic  liver  disease,  and  some  hemoglobinopathies. 
They also can be generated artifactually by improper slide making.

One last feature of the red cells to assess before moving to the white 
blood  cells  is  the  distribution  of  the  red  cells  on  the  smear.  In  most 
individuals, the cells lie side by side in a single layer. Some patients have 
red cell clumping (called agglutination) in which the red cells pile upon 
one  another;  it  is  seen  in  certain  paraproteinemias  and  autoimmune 
hemolytic  anemias.  Another  abnormal  distribution  involves  red  cells 
lying in single cell rows on top of one another like stacks of coins. This 
is called rouleaux formation and reflects abnormal serum protein levels.
Finally,  one  examines  the  white  blood  cells.  Three  types  of  gran-
ulocytes  are  usually  present:  neutrophils,  eosinophils,  and  basophils, 
in decreasing frequency. Neutrophils are generally the most abundant 
white cell. They are round, are 10–14 μm wide, and contain a lobulated 
nucleus with two to five lobes connected by a thin chromatin thread. 
Bands  are  immature  neutrophils  that  have  not  completed  nuclear 
condensation and have a U-shaped nucleus. Bands reflect a left shift 
in neutrophil maturation in an effort to make more cells more rapidly. 
Neutrophils  can  provide  clues  to  a  variety  of  conditions.  Vacuolated 
neutrophils  may  be  a  sign  of  bacterial  sepsis.  The  presence  of  1-  to 
2-μm  blue  cytoplasmic  inclusions,  called  Döhle  bodies,  can  reflect 
infections, burns, or other inflammatory states. If the neutrophil gran-
ules are larger than normal and stain a darker blue, “toxic granulations” 
are said to be present, and they also suggest a systemic inflammation. 
The presence of neutrophils with more than five nuclear lobes suggests 
megaloblastic anemia. Large misshapen granules may reflect the inher-
ited Chédiak-Higashi syndrome.

Eosinophils are slightly larger than neutrophils, have bilobed nuclei, 
and contain large red granules. Diseases of eosinophils are associated 
with  too  many  of  them  rather  than  any  morphologic  or  qualitative 
change. They normally total less than one-thirtieth the number of neu-
trophils. Basophils are even more rare than eosinophils in the blood. 
They  have  large  dark  blue  granules  and  may  be  increased  as  part  of 
chronic myeloid leukemia.

Lymphocytes  can  be  present  in  several  morphologic  forms.  Most 
common  in  healthy  individuals  are  small  lymphocytes  with  a  small 
dark nucleus and scarce cytoplasm. In the presence of viral infections, 
more of the lymphocytes are larger, about the size of neutrophils, with 
abundant  cytoplasm  and  a  less  condensed  nuclear  chromatin.  These 
cells are called reactive lymphocytes. About 1% of lymphocytes are larger 
and contain blue granules in a light blue cytoplasm; they are called large 
granular  lymphocytes.  In  chronic  lymphoid  leukemia,  the  small  lym-
phocytes are increased in number, and many of them are ruptured in 
making the blood smear, leaving a smudge of nuclear material without 
a surrounding cytoplasm or cell membrane; they are called smudge cells 
and are rare in the absence of chronic lymphoid leukemia.

Monocytes  are  the  largest  white  blood  cells,  ranging  from  15  to  
22  μm  in  diameter.  The  nucleus  can  take  on  a  variety  of  shapes  but 
usually appears to be folded; the cytoplasm is gray.

Abnormal cells may appear in the blood. Most often, the abnormal 
cells originate from neoplasms of bone marrow–derived cells, includ-
ing  lymphoid  cells,  myeloid  cells,  and  occasionally  red  cells.  More 
rarely, other types of tumors can get access to the bloodstream, and rare

63 Anemia and Polycythemia

John W. Adamson, Dan L. Longo

HEMATOPOIESIS AND THE PHYSIOLOGIC 
BASIS OF RED CELL PRODUCTION
Hematopoiesis is the process by which the formed elements of blood are 
produced. The process is regulated through a series of steps beginning 
with the hematopoietic stem cell. Stem cells are capable of producing 
red cells, all classes of granulocytes, monocytes, platelets, and the cells 
of the immune system. The precise molecular mechanism by which the 
stem  cell  becomes  committed  to  a  given  lineage  is  not  fully  defined. 
However, experiments in mice suggest that erythroid cells come from a 
common erythroid/megakaryocyte progenitor that does not develop in 
the absence of expression of the GATA-1 and FOG-1 (friend of GATA-1)  
transcription  factors  (Chap.  96).  Following  lineage  commitment, 
hematopoietic progenitor and precursor cells come increasingly under 
the regulatory influence of growth factors and hormones. For red cell 
production, erythropoietin (EPO) is the primary regulatory hormone. 
EPO is required for the maintenance of committed erythroid progen-
itor  cells  that,  in  the  absence  of  the  hormone,  undergo  programmed 
cell death (apoptosis). The regulated process of red cell production is 
erythropoiesis, and its key elements are illustrated in Fig. 63-1.

In  the  bone  marrow,  the  first  morphologically  recognizable  ery-
throid precursor is the pronormoblast. This cell can undergo four to 
five cell divisions, which result in the production of 16–32 mature red 
cells. With increased EPO production, or the administration of EPO 
as  a  drug,  early  progenitor  cell  numbers  are  amplified  and,  in  turn, 
give rise to increased numbers of erythrocytes. The regulation of EPO 
production itself is linked to tissue oxygenation.

In mammals, O2 is transported to tissues bound to the hemoglobin 
contained within circulating red cells. The mature red cell is 8 μm in 
diameter,  anucleate,  discoid  in  shape,  and  extremely  pliable  in  order 
to  traverse  the  microcirculation  successfully;  its  membrane  integrity 
is maintained by the intracellular generation of ATP. Normal red cell 
production results in the daily replacement of 0.8–1% of all circulating 
red cells in the body, since the average red cell lives 100–120 days. The 
organ  responsible  for  red  cell  production  is  called  the  erythron.  The 
erythron is a dynamic organ made up of a rapidly proliferating pool of 
marrow erythroid precursor cells and a large mass of mature circulat-
ing red blood cells. The size of the red cell mass reflects the balance of 
red cell production and destruction. The physiologic basis of red cell 
production and destruction provides an understanding of the mecha-
nisms that can lead to anemia.

The  physiologic  regulator  of  red  cell  production,  the  glycoprotein 
hormone EPO, is produced and released by peritubular capillary lining 
cells within the kidney. These cells are highly specialized epithelial-like 
cells. A small amount of EPO is produced by hepatocytes. The funda-
mental stimulus for EPO production is the availability of O2 for tissue 
metabolic  needs.  Key  to  EPO  gene  regulation  is  hypoxia-inducible 
factor  (HIF)-1α.  In  the  presence  of  O2,  HIF-1α  is  hydroxylated  at  a 
key proline, allowing HIF-1α to be ubiquitinated and degraded via the 
proteasome pathway. If O2 becomes limiting, this critical hydroxylation 
step does not occur, allowing HIF-1α to partner with other proteins, 
translocate to the nucleus, and upregulate the expression of the EPO 
gene, among others.

Impaired O2 delivery to the kidney can result from a decreased red 
cell mass (anemia), impaired O2 loading of the hemoglobin molecule 
or  a  high  O2  affinity  mutant  hemoglobin  (hypoxemia),  or,  rarely, 
impaired  blood  flow  to  the  kidney  (e.g.,  renal  artery  stenosis).  EPO 
governs the day-to-day production of red cells, and ambient levels of 
the hormone can be measured in the plasma by sensitive immunoas-
says—the normal level being 10–25 U/L. When the hemoglobin con-
centration  falls  below  100–120  g/L  (10–12  g/dL),  plasma  EPO  levels 
increase  in  proportion  to  the  severity  of  the  anemia  (Fig.  63-2).  In 
circulation, EPO has a half-clearance time of 6–9 h. EPO acts by bind-
ing to specific receptors on the surface of marrow erythroid precursors, 
inducing  them  to  proliferate  and  to  mature.  With  EPO  stimulation, 
red cell production can increase four- to fivefold within a 1- to 2-week 
period, but only in the presence of adequate nutrients, especially iron. 
The  functional  capacity  of  the  erythron,  therefore,  requires  normal 
renal  production  of  EPO,  a  functioning  erythroid  marrow,  and  an 
adequate  supply  of  substrates  for  hemoglobin  synthesis.  A  defect  in 
any  of  these  key  components  can  lead  to  anemia.  Generally,  anemia 
is  recognized  in  the  laboratory  when  a  patient’s  hemoglobin  level  or 
hematocrit  is  reduced  below  an  expected  value  (the  normal  range).

In the presence of chronic kidney disease or chronic inflammation, EPO levels are 
typically  lower  than  expected  for  the  degree  of  anemia.  As  individuals  age,  the 
level  of  EPO  needed  to  sustain  normal  hemoglobin  levels  appears  to  increase.

432 The likelihood and severity of anemia are defined based on the devia-
tion of the patient’s hemoglobin/hematocrit from values expected for 
age- and sex-matched normal subjects. The hemoglobin concentration 
in adults has a Gaussian distribution. The normal range of hemoglobin 
values  for  adult  males  is  13.5–17.5  g/dL  (135–175  g/L)  and  that  for 
adult females is 12–15 g/dL (120–150 g/L). The World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) defines anemia as a hemoglobin level <13 g/dL (130 
g/L) in men and <12 g/dL (120 g/L) in women. Hematocrit levels are 
less useful than hemoglobin levels in assessing anemia because they are 
calculated rather than measured directly. Suspected low hemoglobin or 
hematocrit values are more easily interpreted if previous values for the 
same patient are known for comparison.

The  critical  elements  of  erythropoiesis—EPO  production,  iron 
availability, the proliferative capacity of the bone marrow, and effective 
maturation of red cell precursors—are used for the initial classification 
of anemia (see below).

ANEMIA
 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF ANEMIA
Signs and Symptoms  Anemia is most often recognized by abnor-
mal  screening  laboratory  tests.  Patients  less  commonly  present  with 
advanced anemia and its attendant signs and symptoms. Acute anemia 
is due to blood loss or hemolysis. If blood loss is mild, enhanced O2 
delivery is achieved through changes in the O2–hemoglobin dissocia-
tion curve mediated by a decreased pH or increased CO2 (Bohr effect). 
With  acute  blood  loss,  hypovolemia  dominates  the  clinical  picture, 
and  the  hematocrit  and  hemoglobin  levels  do  not  reflect  the  volume 
of blood lost. Signs of vascular instability appear with acute losses of 
10–15%  of  the  total  blood  volume.  In  such  patients,  the  issue  is  not 
anemia but hypotension and decreased organ perfusion. When >30% 
of the blood volume is lost suddenly, patients are unable to compensate 
with  the  usual  mechanisms  of  vascular  contraction  and  changes  in 
regional blood flow. The patient prefers to remain supine and will show 
postural  hypotension  and  tachycardia.  If  the  volume  of  blood  lost  is 
>40% (i.e., >2 L in the average-sized adult), signs of hypovolemic shock 
including confusion, dyspnea, diaphoresis, hypotension, and tachycar-
dia appear (Chap. 101). Such patients have significant deficits in vital 
organ perfusion and require immediate volume replacement.

With acute hemolysis, the signs and symptoms depend on the mech-
anism  that  leads  to  red  cell  destruction.  Intravascular  hemolysis  with 
release of free hemoglobin may be associated with acute back pain, free 
hemoglobin in the plasma and urine, and renal failure. Symptoms asso-
ciated with more chronic or progressive anemia depend on the age of the 
patient and the adequacy of blood supply to critical organs. Symptoms 
associated with moderate anemia include fatigue, loss of stamina, breath-
lessness, and tachycardia (particularly with physical exertion). However, 
because  of  the  intrinsic  compensatory  mechanisms  that  govern  the 
O2–hemoglobin dissociation curve, the gradual onset of anemia—partic-
ularly in young patients—may not be associated with signs or symptoms 
until the anemia is severe (hemoglobin <70–80 g/L [7–8 g/dL]). When 
anemia develops over a period of days or weeks, the total blood volume is 
normal to slightly increased, and changes in cardiac output and regional 
blood  flow  help  compensate  for  the  overall  loss  in  O2-carrying  capac-
ity.  Changes  in  the  position  of  the  O2–hemoglobin  dissociation  curve 
account for some of the compensatory response to anemia. With chronic 
anemia, intracellular levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate rise, shifting the 
dissociation curve to the right and facilitating O2 unloading. This com-
pensatory  mechanism  can  only  maintain  normal  tissue  O2  delivery  in 
the face of a 20–30 g/L (2–3 g/dL) deficit in hemoglobin concentration. 
Finally, further protection of O2 delivery to vital organs is achieved by 
the shunting of blood away from organs that are relatively rich in blood 
supply, particularly the kidney, gut, and skin.

Certain  disorders  are  commonly  associated  with  anemia.  Chronic 
inflammatory  states  (e.g.,  infection,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  cancer)  are 
associated with mild to moderate anemia, whereas lymphoproliferative 
disorders,  such  as  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  and  certain  other 
B-cell neoplasms, may be associated with autoimmune hemolysis.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Anemia

The evaluation of the patient with anemia requires a careful history 
and  physical  examination.  Nutritional  history  related  to  drugs 
or  alcohol  intake  and  family  history  of  anemia  should  always  be 
assessed.  Certain  geographic  backgrounds  and  ethnic  origins  are 
associated with an increased likelihood of an inherited disorder of 
the hemoglobin molecule or intermediary metabolism. Glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and certain hemoglo-
binopathies  are  seen  more  commonly  in  those  of  Middle  Eastern 
or African origin, including blacks who have a high frequency of 
G6PD  deficiency.  Other  information  that  may  be  useful  includes 
exposure to certain toxic agents or drugs and symptoms related to 
other disorders commonly associated with anemia. These include 
symptoms and signs such as bleeding, fatigue, malaise, fever, weight 
loss,  night  sweats,  and  other  systemic  symptoms.  Clues  to  the 
mechanisms of anemia may be provided on physical examination 
by findings of infection, blood in the stool, lymphadenopathy, sple-
nomegaly, or petechiae. Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy sug-
gest an underlying lymphoproliferative disease, whereas petechiae 
suggest  platelet  dysfunction.  Past  laboratory  measurements  are 
helpful to determine a time of onset.

In  the  anemic  patient,  physical  examination  may  demonstrate 
a forceful heartbeat, strong peripheral pulses, and a systolic “flow” 
murmur.  The  skin  and  mucous  membranes  may  be  pale  if  the 
hemoglobin is <8–10 g/dL (80–100 g/L). This part of the physical 
examination  should  focus  on  areas  where  vessels  are  close  to  the 
surface  such  as  the  mucous  membranes,  nail  beds,  and  palmar 
creases. If the palmar creases are lighter in color than the surround-
ing skin when the hand is hyperextended, the hemoglobin level is 
usually <8 g/dL (80 g/L). 

LABORATORY EVALUATION
Table  63-1  lists  the  tests  used  in  the  initial  workup  of  anemia.  A 
routine  complete  blood  count  (CBC)  is  required  as  part  of  the 
evaluation  and  includes  the  hemoglobin,  hematocrit,  and  red  cell 
indices:  the  mean  cell  volume  (MCV)  in  femtoliters,  mean  cell 
hemoglobin (MCH) in picograms per cell, and mean concentration 
of hemoglobin per volume of red cells (MCHC) in grams per liter 
(non-SI:  grams  per  deciliter).  The  MCH  is  the  least  useful  of  the 
indices;  it  tends  to  track  with  the  MCV.  The  red  cell  indices  are 
calculated  as  shown  in  Table  63-2,  and  the  normal  variations  in 
the hemoglobin and hematocrit with age are shown in Table 63-3. 
A number of physiologic factors affect the CBC, including age, sex, 
pregnancy, smoking, and altitude. High-normal hemoglobin values 
may  be  seen  in  men  and  women  who  live  at  altitude  or  smoke 
heavily.  Hemoglobin  elevations  due  to  smoking  reflect  normal 
compensation due to the displacement of O2 by CO in hemoglobin 
binding. Other important information is provided by the reticulo-
cyte count and measurements of iron supply including serum iron, 
total  iron-binding  capacity  (TIBC;  an  indirect  measure  of  serum 
transferrin), and serum ferritin. Marked alterations in the red cell 
indices usually reflect disorders of maturation or iron deficiency. A 
careful evaluation of the peripheral blood smear is important, and 
clinical laboratories often provide a description of both the red and 
white  cells,  a  white  cell  differential  count,  and  the  platelet  count. 
In patients with severe anemia and abnormalities in red blood cell 
morphology and/or low reticulocyte counts, a bone marrow aspi-
rate or biopsy can assist in the diagnosis. Other tests of value in the 
diagnosis of specific anemias are discussed in chapters on specific 
disease states.

The  components  of  the  CBC  also  help  in  the  classification  of 
anemia.  Microcytosis  is  reflected  by  a  lower  than  normal  MCV 
(<80), whereas high values (>100) reflect macrocytosis. The MCHC 
reflects  defects  in  hemoglobin  synthesis  (hypochromia).  Auto-
mated cell counters describe the red cell volume distribution width 
(RDW). The MCV (representing the peak of the distribution curve)

is insensitive to the appearance of small populations of macrocytes 
or microcytes. An experienced laboratory technician will be able to 
identify minor populations of large or small cells or hypochromic 
cells on the peripheral blood film before the red cell indices change. 
Peripheral  Blood  Smear  The  peripheral  blood  smear  provides 
important information about defects in red cell production (Chap. 
62). As a complement to the red cell indices, the blood smear also 
reveals variations in cell size (anisocytosis) and shape (poikilocyto-
sis). The degree of anisocytosis usually correlates with increases in 
the RDW or the range of cell sizes. Poikilocytosis suggests a defect 
in  the  maturation  of  red  cell  precursors  in  the  bone  marrow  or 
fragmentation  of  circulating  red  cells.  The  blood  smear  may  also 
reveal  polychromasia—red  cells  that  are  slightly  larger  than  nor-
mal and grayish blue in color on the Wright-Giemsa stain. These 
cells  are  reticulocytes  that  have  been  released  prematurely  from 
the  bone  marrow  and  their  color  represents  residual  amounts  of 
ribosomal  RNA.  These  cells  appear  in  circulation  in  response  to 
EPO  stimulation  or  to  architectural  damage  of  the  bone  marrow 
(fibrosis,  infiltration  of  the  marrow  by  malignant  cells,  etc.)  that 
results  in  their  disordered  release  from  the  marrow.  The  appear-
ance of nucleated red cells, Howell-Jolly bodies, target cells, sickle 
cells,  and  other  changes  may  provide  clues  to  specific  disorders   
(Figs. 63-3 to 63-11).

TABLE 63-4  Calculation of Reticulocyte Production Index
Correction #1 for Anemia:

This correction produces the corrected reticulocyte count.
In a person whose reticulocyte count is 9%, hemoglobin 7.5 g/dL, and hematocrit 
23%, the absolute reticulocyte count = 9 × (7.5/15) [or × (23/45)] = 4.5%
Note. This correction is not done if the reticulocyte count is reported in absolute 
numbers (e.g., 50,000/μL of blood)

Correction #2 for Longer Life of Prematurely Released Reticulocytes in 
the Blood:

This correction produces the reticulocyte production index.

while the absolute number is unchanged. To correct for this effect, 
the reticulocyte percentage is multiplied by the ratio of the patient’s 
hemoglobin or hematocrit to the expected hemoglobin/hematocrit 
for  the  age  and  sex  of  the  patient  (Table  63-4).  This  provides  an 
estimate of the reticulocyte count corrected for anemia. To convert 
the corrected reticulocyte count to an index of marrow production, 
a further correction is required, depending on whether some of the 
reticulocytes  in  circulation  have  been  released  from  the  marrow 
prematurely. For this second correction, the peripheral blood smear 
is  examined  to  see  if  there  are  polychromatophilic  macrocytes 
present.

These cells, representing prematurely released reticulocytes, are 
referred to as “shift” cells, and the relationship between the degree 
of  shift  and  the  necessary  shift  correction  factor  is  shown  in 
Fig. 63-13. The correction is necessary because these prematurely 
released  cells  survive  as  reticulocytes  in  circulation  for  >1  day, 
thereby providing a falsely high estimate of daily red cell produc-
tion. If polychromasia is increased, the reticulocyte count, already 
corrected for anemia, should be corrected again by 2 to account for 
the prolonged reticulocyte maturation time. The second correction 
factor varies from 1 to 3 depending on the severity of anemia. To 
simplify things, a correction of 2 is used. An appropriate correction 
is shown in Table 63-4. If polychromatophilic cells are not seen on

FIGURE 63-13  Correction of the reticulocyte count. To use the reticulocyte count 
as  an  indicator  of  effective  red  cell  production,  the  reticulocyte  number  must 
be  corrected  based  on  the  level  of  anemia  and  the  circulating  life  span  of  the 
reticulocytes.  Erythroid  cells  take  ∼4.5  days  to  mature.  At  a  normal  hemoglobin, 
reticulocytes  are  released  to  the  circulation  with  ∼1  day  left  as  reticulocytes. 
However, with different levels of anemia, reticulocytes (and even earlier erythroid 
cells)  may  be  released  from  the  marrow  prematurely.  Most  patients  come  to 
clinical attention with hematocrits in the mid-20s, and thus a correction factor of 
2 is commonly used because the observed reticulocytes will live for 2 days in the 
circulation before losing their RNA.

FIGURE 63-11  Spur cells. Spur cells are recognized as distorted red cells containing 
several  irregularly  distributed  thorn-like  projections.  Cells  with  this  morphologic 
abnormality are also called acanthocytes. (From RS Hillman et al: Hematology in 
Clinical Practice, 5th ed. New York, McGraw-Hill, 2010.)

Reticulocyte  Count  An  accurate  reticulocyte  count  is  key  to  the 
initial classification of anemia. Reticulocytes are red cells that have 
been recently released from the bone marrow. They are identified 
by  staining  with  a  supravital  dye  that  precipitates  the  ribosomal 
RNA  (Fig.  63-12).  These  precipitates  appear  as  blue  or  black 
punctate spots and can be counted manually or, currently, by flu-
orescent emission of dyes that bind to RNA. This residual RNA is 
metabolized over the first 24–36 h of the reticulocyte’s life span in 
circulation. Normally, the reticulocyte count ranges from 1% to 2% 
and reflects the daily replacement of 0.8–1.0% of the circulating red 
cell population. A corrected reticulocyte percentage or the absolute 
number of reticulocytes provides a reliable measure of effective red 
cell production.

In  the  initial  classification  of  anemia,  the  patient’s  reticulocyte 
count  is  compared  with  the  expected  reticulocyte  response.  In 
general,  if  the  EPO  and  erythroid  marrow  responses  to  moderate 
anemia [hemoglobin <100 g/L (10 g/dL)] are intact, the red cell pro-
duction rate increases to two to three times normal within 10 days 
following the onset of anemia. In the face of established anemia, a 
reticulocyte response less than two to three times normal indicates 
an inadequate marrow response.

To use the reticulocyte count to estimate marrow response, two 
corrections are necessary. The first correction adjusts the reticulo-
cyte  count  based  on  the  reduced  number  of  circulating  red  cells. 
With  anemia,  the  percentage  of  reticulocytes  may  be  increased

the blood smear, the second correction is not indicated. The now 
doubly  corrected  reticulocyte  count  is  the  reticulocyte  production 
index,  and  it  provides  an  estimate  of  marrow  production  relative 
to normal. In many hospital laboratories, the reticulocyte count is 
reported not only as a percentage but also in absolute numbers. If 
so, no correction for dilution is required. A summary of the appro-
priate marrow response to varying degrees of anemia is shown in 
Table 63-5.

Premature release of reticulocytes is normally due to increased 
EPO  stimulation.  However,  if  the  integrity  of  the  bone  marrow 
release process is lost through tumor infiltration, fibrosis, or other 
disorders,  the  appearance  of  nucleated  red  cells  or  polychro-
matophilic  macrocytes  should  still  invoke  the  second  reticulocyte 
correction.  The  shift  correction  should  always  be  applied  to  a 
patient with anemia and a very high reticulocyte count to provide 
a  true  index  of  effective  red  cell  production.  Patients  with  severe 
chronic  hemolytic  anemia  may  increase  red  cell  production  as 
much as six- to sevenfold. This measure alone confirms the fact that 
the patient has an appropriate EPO response, a normally function-
ing bone marrow, and sufficient iron available to meet the demands 
for new red cell formation. If the reticulocyte production index is 
<2 in the face of established anemia, a defect in erythroid marrow 
proliferation or maturation must be present. 
Tests  of  Iron  Supply  and  Storage  The  laboratory  measure-
ments that reflect the availability of iron for hemoglobin synthesis  
include the serum iron, the TIBC, and the percent transferrin sat-
uration.  The  percent  transferrin  saturation  is  derived  by  dividing 
the serum iron level (× 100) by the TIBC. The normal serum iron 
ranges  from  9  to  27  μmol/L  (50–150  μg/dL),  whereas  the  normal 
TIBC  is  54–64  μmol/L  (300–360  μg/dL);  the  normal  transferrin 
saturation ranges from 25 to 50%. A diurnal variation in the serum 
iron leads to a variation in the percent transferrin saturation. The 
serum ferritin is used to evaluate total body iron stores. Adult males 
have  serum  ferritin  levels  that  average  ∼100  μg/L,  corresponding 
to  iron  stores  of  ∼1  g.  Adult  premenopausal  females  have  lower 
serum ferritin levels averaging 30 μg/L, reflecting lower iron stores  
(∼300 mg). A serum ferritin level of 10–15 μg/L indicates depletion 
of body iron stores. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase reac-
tant  and,  in  the  presence  of  acute  or  chronic  inflammation,  may 
rise  several-fold  above  baseline  levels.  As  a  rule,  a  serum  ferritin   
>200 μg/L means there is at least some iron in tissue stores. 
Bone  Marrow  Examination  A  bone  marrow  aspirate  and  smear 
or a needle biopsy can be useful in the evaluation of some patients 
with  anemia.  In  patients  with  hypoproliferative  anemia,  normal 
renal function, and normal iron status, a bone marrow is indicated. 
Marrow examination can diagnose primary marrow disorders such 
as  myelofibrosis,  a  red  cell  maturation  defect,  or  an  infiltrative 
disease (Figs. 63-14 to 63-16). The increase or decrease of one cell 
lineage (myeloid vs erythroid) compared to another is obtained by 
a differential count of nucleated cells in a bone marrow smear (the 
myeloid/erythroid [M/E] ratio). A patient with a hypoproliferative 
anemia  (see  below)  and  a  reticulocyte  production  index  <2  will 
demonstrate  an  M/E  ratio  of  2  or  3:1.  In  contrast,  patients  with 
hemolytic disease and a production index >3 will have an M/E ratio 
of at least 1:1. Maturation disorders are identified from the discrep-
ancy between the M/E ratio and the reticulocyte production index 
(see  below).  Either  the  marrow  smear  or  biopsy  can  be  stained 
for the presence of iron stores or iron in developing red cells. The

normal bone marrow biopsy stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Note that the 
nucleated cellular elements account for ∼40–50% and the fat (clear areas) accounts 
for ∼50–60% of the area. (From RS Hillman et al: Hematology in Clinical Practice,  
5th ed. New York, McGraw-Hill, 2010.)

storage iron is in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin. On carefully 
prepared bone marrow smears, small ferritin granules can normally 
be  seen  under  oil  immersion  in  20–40%  of  developing  erythrob-
lasts. Such cells are called sideroblasts. 
OTHER LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS
Additional laboratory tests may be of value in confirming specific 
diagnoses. For details of these tests and how they are applied in 
individual disorders, see Chaps. 97 to 101.

 ■ DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF ANEMIA
Initial Classification of Anemia  The functional classification of 
anemia has three major categories. These are (1) marrow production 
defects  (hypoproliferation),  (2)  red  cell  maturation  defects  (ineffective 
erythropoiesis), and (3) decreased red cell survival (blood loss/hemolysis). 
The classification is shown in Fig. 63-17. A hypoproliferative anemia is 
typically seen with a low reticulocyte production index together with 
little or no change in red cell morphology (a normocytic, normochro-
mic anemia) (Chap. 97). Maturation disorders typically have a slight to 
moderately elevated reticulocyte production index that is accompanied 
by either macrocytic (Chap. 99) or microcytic (Chaps. 97, 98) red cell 

FIGURE  63-15  Erythroid  hyperplasia.  This  marrow  shows  an  increase  in  the 
fraction of cells in the erythroid lineage as might be seen when a normal marrow 
compensates for acute blood loss or hemolysis. The myeloid/erythroid (M/E) ratio is 
about 1:1. (From RS Hillman et al: Hematology in Clinical Practice, 5th ed. New York, 
McGraw-Hill, 2010.)

in  nature.  Maturation  disorders  are  characterized  by  ineffective  red 
cell  production  and  a  low  reticulocyte  production  index.  Bizarre  red 
cell shapes—macrocytes or hypochromic microcytes—are seen on the 
peripheral blood smear. With a hypoproliferative anemia, no erythroid 
hyperplasia is noted in the marrow, whereas patients with ineffective 
red cell production have erythroid hyperplasia and an M/E ratio <1:1.
Hypoproliferative Anemias  At least 75% of all cases of anemia 
are  hypoproliferative  in  nature.  A  hypoproliferative  anemia  reflects 
absolute or relative marrow failure in which the erythroid marrow has 
not proliferated appropriately for the degree of anemia. The majority of 
hypoproliferative anemias are due to mild to moderate iron deficiency 
or inflammation. A hypoproliferative anemia can result from marrow 
damage, iron deficiency, or inadequate EPO stimulation. The last may 
reflect  impaired  renal  function,  suppression  of  EPO  production  by 
inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1, or reduced tissue needs 
for O2 from metabolic disease such as hypothyroidism. Only occasion-
ally is the marrow unable to produce red cells at a normal rate, and this 
is most prevalent in patients with renal failure. With diabetes mellitus 
or myeloma, the EPO deficiency may be more marked than would be 
predicted by the degree of renal insufficiency. In general, hypoprolif-
erative  anemias  are  characterized  by  normocytic,  normochromic  red 
cells,  although  microcytic,  hypochromic  cells  may  be  observed  with 
mild  iron  deficiency  or  long-standing  chronic  inflammatory  disease. 
The key laboratory tests in distinguishing between the various forms 
of hypoproliferative anemia include the serum iron and iron-binding 
capacity, evaluation of renal and thyroid function, a marrow biopsy or 
aspirate  to  detect  marrow  damage  or  infiltrative  disease,  and  serum 
ferritin to assess iron stores. An iron stain of the marrow will determine 
the pattern of iron distribution. Patients with the anemia of acute or 
chronic inflammation show a distinctive pattern of serum iron (low), 
TIBC (normal or low), percent transferrin saturation (low), and serum 
ferritin  (normal  or  high).  These  changes  in  iron  values  are  brought 
about  by  hepcidin,  the  iron  regulatory  hormone  that  is  produced 
by  the  liver  and  is  increased  in  inflammation  (Chap.  97).  A  distinct 
pattern  of  results  is  noted  in  mild  to  moderate  iron  deficiency  (low 
serum iron, high TIBC, low percent transferrin saturation, low serum 
ferritin)  (Chap.  97).  Marrow  damage  by  drugs,  infiltrative  disease 
such as leukemia or lymphoma, or marrow aplasia is diagnosed from 
the peripheral blood and bone marrow morphology. With infiltrative 
disease or fibrosis, a marrow biopsy is required.
Maturation Disorders  The presence of anemia with an inappro-
priately low reticulocyte production index, macro- or microcytosis on 
smear, and abnormal red cell indices suggests a maturation disorder. 
Maturation disorders are divided into two categories: nuclear matura-
tion defects, associated with macrocytosis, and cytoplasmic maturation 
defects,  associated  with  microcytosis  and  hypochromia  usually  from 
defects in hemoglobin synthesis. The inappropriately low reticulocyte 
production  index  is  a  reflection  of  the  ineffective  erythropoiesis  that 
results  from  the  destruction  within  the  marrow  of  developing  ery-
throblasts. Bone marrow examination shows erythroid hyperplasia.

Nuclear  maturation  defects  result  from  vitamin  B12  or  folic  acid 
deficiency, drug damage, or myelodysplasia. Drugs that interfere with 
cellular DNA synthesis, such as methotrexate or alkylating agents, can 
produce  a  nuclear  maturation  defect.  Alcohol,  alone,  is  also  capable 
of  producing  macrocytosis  and  a  variable  degree  of  anemia,  but  this 
is usually associated with folic acid deficiency. Measurements of folic 
acid  and  vitamin  B12  are  critical  not  only  in  identifying  the  specific 
vitamin deficiency but also because they reflect different pathogenetic 
mechanisms (Chap. 99).

Cytoplasmic  maturation  defects  result  from  severe  iron  deficiency 
or  abnormalities  in  globin  or  heme  synthesis.  Iron  deficiency  occu-
pies  an  unusual  position  in  the  classification  of  anemia.  If  the  iron- 
deficiency anemia is mild to moderate, erythroid marrow proliferation 
is blunted and the anemia is classified as hypoproliferative. However, 
if  the  anemia  is  severe  and  prolonged,  the  erythroid  marrow  will 
become hyperplastic despite the inadequate iron supply, and the ane-
mia will be classified as ineffective erythropoiesis with a cytoplasmic 
maturation  defect.  In  either  case,  an  inappropriately  low  reticulocyte 

FIGURE 63-16  Myeloid hyperplasia. This marrow shows an increase in the fraction 
of cells in the myeloid or granulocytic lineage as might be seen in a normal marrow 
responding to infection. The myeloid/erythroid (M/E) ratio is >3:1. (From RS Hillman 
et al: Hematology in Clinical Practice, 5th ed. New York, McGraw-Hill, 2010.)

indices.  Increased  red  blood  cell  destruction  secondary  to  hemolysis 
results in an increase in the reticulocyte production index to at least 
three times normal (Chap. 100), provided sufficient iron is available. 
Hemorrhagic anemia does not typically result in production indices of 
more than 2.0–2.5 times normal because of the limitations placed on 
expansion of the erythroid marrow by iron availability (Chap. 101).

In  the  first  branch  point  of  the  classification  of  anemia,  a  reticu-
locyte  production  index  >2.5  indicates  that  hemolysis  is  most  likely. 
A  reticulocyte  production  index  <2  indicates  either  a  hypoprolifer-
ative  anemia  or  maturation  disorder.  The  latter  two  possibilities  can 
often  be  distinguished  by  the  red  cell  indices,  by  examination  of  the 
peripheral  blood  smear,  or  by  a  marrow  examination.  If  the  red  cell 
indices  are  normal,  the  anemia  is  almost  certainly  hypoproliferative

production  index,  microcytosis,  and  a  classic  pattern  of  iron  values 
make  the  diagnosis  clear  and  easily  distinguish  iron  deficiency  from 
other cytoplasmic maturation defects such as the thalassemias. Defects 
in heme synthesis, in contrast to globin synthesis, are less common and 
may be acquired or inherited (Chap. 416). Acquired abnormalities are 
usually associated with myelodysplasia, may lead to either a macro- or 
microcytic anemia, and are frequently associated with mitochondrial 
iron loading. In these cases, iron is taken up by the mitochondria of 
the  developing  erythroid  cell  but  not  incorporated  into  heme.  The 
iron-encrusted  mitochondria  surround  the  nucleus  of  the  erythroid 
cell, forming a ring. Based on the distinctive finding of so-called ringed 
sideroblasts on the marrow iron stain, patients are diagnosed as hav-
ing  a  sideroblastic  anemia—almost  always  reflecting  myelodysplasia. 
Again, studies of iron parameters are helpful in the differential diag-
nosis of these patients.

Blood Loss/Hemolytic Anemia 
In contrast to anemias associ-
ated with an inappropriately low reticulocyte production index, hemo-
lysis is associated with red cell production indices ≥2.5 times normal. 
The  stimulated  erythropoiesis  is  reflected  in  the  blood  smear  by  the 
appearance  of  increased  numbers  of  polychromatophilic  macrocytes. 
A marrow examination is rarely indicated if the reticulocyte produc-
tion index is increased appropriately. The red cell indices are typically 
normocytic  or  slightly  macrocytic,  reflecting  the  increased  number 
of reticulocytes. Acute blood loss is not associated with an increased 
reticulocyte production index because of the time required to increase 
EPO production and, subsequently, marrow proliferation (Chap. 101). 
Subacute  blood  loss  may  be  associated  with  modest  reticulocytosis. 
Anemia from chronic blood loss presents more often as iron deficiency 
than with the picture of increased red cell production.

The  evaluation  of  blood  loss  anemia  is  usually  not  difficult.  Most 
problems arise when a patient presents with an increased red cell pro-
duction index from an episode of acute blood loss that went unrecog-
nized. The cause of the anemia and increased red cell production may 
not  be  obvious.  The  confirmation  of  a  recovering  state  may  require 
observations over a period of 2–3 weeks, during which the hemoglo-
bin concentration will rise and the reticulocyte production index fall 
(Chap. 101).

Hemolytic  disease,  while  dramatic,  is  among  the  least  common 
forms of anemia. The ability to sustain a high reticulocyte production 
index  reflects  the  ability  of  the  erythroid  marrow  to  compensate  for 
hemolysis  and,  in  the  case  of  extravascular  hemolysis,  the  efficient 
recycling of iron from the destroyed red cells to support red cell pro-
duction. With intravascular hemolysis, such as paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria, the loss of iron may limit the marrow response. The 
level of response depends on the severity of the anemia and the nature 
of the underlying disease process.

Hemoglobinopathies,  such  as  sickle  cell  disease  and  the  thalas-
semias, present a mixed picture. The reticulocyte index may be high 
but is inappropriately low for the degree of marrow erythroid hyper-
plasia (Chap. 98).

Hemolytic  anemias  present  in  different  ways.  Some  appear  sud-
denly as an acute, self-limited episode of intravascular or extravascular 
hemolysis, a presentation pattern often seen in patients with autoim-
mune  hemolysis  or  with  inherited  defects  of  the  Embden-Meyerhof 
pathway or the glutathione reductase pathway. Patients with inherited 
disorders of the hemoglobin molecule or red cell membrane generally 
have a lifelong clinical history typical of the disease process. Those with 
chronic hemolytic disease, such as hereditary spherocytosis, may actu-
ally present not with anemia but with a complication stemming from 
the  prolonged  increase  in  red  cell  destruction  such  as  symptomatic 
bilirubin gallstones or splenomegaly. Patients with chronic hemolysis 
are also susceptible to aplastic crises if an infectious process interrupts 
red cell production.

The  differential  diagnosis  of  an  acute  or  chronic  hemolytic  event 
requires the careful integration of family history, the pattern of clinical 
presentation,  and—whether  the  disease  is  congenital  or  acquired—
careful  examination  of  the  peripheral  blood  smear.  Precise  diagnosis 
may  require  more  specialized  laboratory  tests,  such  as  hemoglobin 

electrophoresis  or  a  screen  for  red  cell  enzymes.  Acquired  defects  in 
red  cell  survival  are  often  immunologically  mediated  and  require  a 
direct or indirect antiglobulin test or a cold agglutinin titer to detect 
the presence of hemolytic antibodies or complement-mediated red cell 
destruction (Chap. 100).

TREATMENT
Anemia

An overriding principle is to initiate treatment of mild to moder-
ate  anemia  only  when  a  specific  diagnosis  is  made.  Rarely,  in  the 
acute  setting,  anemia  may  be  so  severe  that  red  cell  transfusions 
are  required  before  a  specific  diagnosis  is  available.  Whether  the 
anemia is of acute or gradual onset, the selection of the appropriate 
treatment  is  determined  by  the  documented  cause(s)  of  the  ane-
mia. Often, the cause of the anemia is multifactorial. For example, 
a  patient  with  severe  rheumatoid  arthritis  who  has  been  taking 
anti-inflammatory  drugs  may  have  a  hypoproliferative  anemia 
associated  with  chronic  inflammation  as  well  as  chronic  blood 
loss associated with intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding. In every 
circumstance,  it  is  important  to  evaluate  the  patient’s  iron  status 
fully before and during the treatment of any anemia. Transfusion 
is  discussed  in  Chap.  113;  iron  therapy  is  discussed  in  Chap. 
97; treatment of megaloblastic anemia is discussed in Chap. 99; 
treatment of other entities is discussed in their respective chap-
ters (sickle cell anemia, Chap. 98; megaloblastic anemia, Chap. 
99;  hemolytic  anemias,  Chap.  100;  aplastic  anemia  and  myelo-
dysplasia, Chap. 102).

Therapeutic options for the treatment of anemias have expanded 
dramatically during the past 30 years. Blood component therapy is 
available and safe. Recombinant EPO as an adjunct to anemia man-
agement  has  transformed  the  lives  of  patients  with  chronic  renal 
failure on dialysis and reduced transfusion needs of anemic cancer 
patients receiving chemotherapy. Eventually, patients with inherited 
disorders of globin synthesis or mutations in the globin gene, such 
as sickle cell disease, may benefit from the successful introduction 
of targeted genetic therapy (Chap. 470).

POLYCYTHEMIA
Polycythemia is defined as an increase in the hemoglobin above nor-
mal. This increase may be real or only apparent because of a decrease 
in  plasma  volume  (spurious  or  relative  polycythemia).  The  term 
erythrocytosis  may  be  used  interchangeably  with  polycythemia,  but 
some draw a distinction between them: erythrocytosis implies docu-
mentation of increased red cell mass, whereas polycythemia refers to 
any increase in red cells. Often patients with polycythemia are detected 
through  an  incidental  finding  of  elevated  hemoglobin  or  hematocrit 
levels. Concern that the hemoglobin level may be abnormally high is 
usually triggered at 17 g/dL (170 g/L) for men and 15 g/dL (150 g/L) 
for women. Hematocrit levels >50% in men or >45% in women may be 
abnormal. Hematocrits >60% in men and >55% in women are almost 
invariably  associated  with  an  increased  red  cell  mass.  Given  that  the 
machine that quantitates red cell parameters actually measures hemo-
globin  concentrations  and  calculates  hematocrits,  hemoglobin  levels 
may be a better index.

Features  of  the  clinical  history  that  are  useful  in  the  differential 
diagnosis  include  smoking,  current  living  at  high  altitude,  a  history 
of diuretic use, congenital heart disease, sleep apnea, or chronic lung 
disease.

Patients  with  polycythemia  may  be  asymptomatic  or  experience 
symptoms  related  to  the  increased  red  cell  mass  or  the  underlying 
disease process that leads to the increased red cell mass. The dominant 
symptoms from an increased red cell mass are related to hyperviscosity 
and  thrombosis  (both  venous  and  arterial),  because  the  blood  vis-
cosity  increases  logarithmically  at  hematocrits  >55%.  Manifestations 
include  neurologic  symptoms  such  as  vertigo,  tinnitus,  headache, 
and  visual  disturbances.  Hypertension  is  often  present.  Patients  with 
polycythemia vera may have aquagenic pruritus, symptoms related to

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseaseshepatosplenomegaly, easy bruising, epistaxis, or bleeding from the gas-
trointestinal tract. Peptic ulcer disease is common. Such patients also 
may present with digital ischemia, Budd–Chiari syndrome, or hepatic 
or splenic/mesenteric vein thrombosis. Patients with hypoxemia may 
develop  cyanosis  on  minimal  exertion  or  have  headache,  impaired 
mental acuity, and fatigue.

The  physical  examination  usually  reveals  a  ruddy  complexion. 
Splenomegaly favors polycythemia vera as the diagnosis (Chap. 103). 
The presence of cyanosis or evidence of a right-to-left shunt suggests 
congenital heart disease presenting in the adult, particularly tetralogy 
of  Fallot  or  Eisenmenger’s  syndrome  (Chap.  269).  Increased  blood 
viscosity  raises  pulmonary  artery  pressure;  hypoxemia  can  lead  to 
increased  pulmonary  vascular  resistance.  Together,  these  factors  can 
produce cor pulmonale.

Polycythemia  can  be  spurious  (related  to  a  decrease  in  plasma 
volume;  Gaisbock’s  syndrome),  primary,  or  secondary  in  origin.  The 
secondary  causes  are  all  mediated  by  EPO:  either  a  physiologically 
adapted  appropriate  level  based  on  tissue  hypoxia  (lung  disease, 
high  altitude,  CO  poisoning,  high-affinity  hemoglobinopathy)  or  an 
abnormal  overproduction  (renal  cysts,  renal  artery  stenosis,  tumors 
with ectopic EPO production). A rare familial form of polycythemia is 
associated with normal EPO levels but hyperresponsive EPO receptors 
due to mutations.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Polycythemia

As shown in Fig. 63-18, the first step is to document the presence of 
an increased red cell mass using the principle of isotope dilution by 
administering 51Cr-labeled autologous red blood cells to the patient 
and sampling blood radioactivity over a 2-h period. If the red cell 
mass  is  normal  (<36  mL/kg  in  men,  <32  mL/kg  in  women),  the 
patient has spurious or relative polycythemia. If the red cell mass is

increased (>36 mL/kg in men, >32 mL/kg in women), serum EPO 
levels should be measured. It must be acknowledged that measure-
ment  of  red  cell  mass  is  a  physiologic  approach  to  distinguishing 
polycythemia,  and  because  of  the  use  of  radionuclide-labeled  red 
cells,  it  is  rarely  performed.  It  is  more  common  to  measure  EPO 
levels in a person with an elevated hemoglobin level or hematocrit. 
If EPO levels are low or unmeasurable, the patient most likely has 
polycythemia vera. A mutation in JAK2 (Val617Phe), a key mem-
ber  of  the  cytokine  intracellular  signaling  pathway,  can  be  found 
in  90–95%  of  patients  with  polycythemia  vera.  Many  of  those 
without this particular JAK2 mutation have mutations in exon 12. 
If  EPO  levels  are  low,  check  for  JAK2  mutation(s),  and  perform 
an  abdominal  ultrasound  to  assess  spleen  size.  Tests  that  support 
the  diagnosis  of  polycythemia  vera  include  elevated  white  blood 
cell count, increased absolute basophil count, and thrombocytosis. 
In practice, many physicians order EPO levels and assessment for 
JAK2 mutations at the same time.

If serum EPO levels are elevated, one needs to distinguish whether 
the elevation is a physiologic response to hypoxia or related to auton-
omous  EPO  production.  Patients  with  low  arterial  O2  saturation 
(<92%) should be further evaluated for the presence of heart or lung 
disease, if they are not living at high altitude. Patients with normal O2 
saturation who are smokers may have elevated EPO levels because 
of CO displacement of O2. If carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels are 
high, the diagnosis is “smoker’s polycythemia.” Such patients should 
be urged to stop smoking. Those who cannot stop smoking require 
phlebotomy to control their polycythemia. Patients with normal O2 
saturation who do not smoke either have an abnormal hemoglobin 
that does not deliver O2 to the tissues (evaluated by finding elevated 
O2–hemoglobin affinity) or have a source of EPO production that is 
not responding to the normal feedback inhibition. Further workup 
is  dictated  by  the  differential  diagnosis  of  EPO-producing  neo-
plasms. Hepatoma, uterine leiomyoma, and renal cancer or cysts are 
all  detectable  with  abdominopelvic  computed  tomography  scans. 
Cerebellar hemangiomas may produce EPO, but they present with 
localizing  neurologic  signs  and  symptoms  rather  than  polycythe-
mia-related symptoms.

64 Disorders of Granulocytes  
and Monocytes
Steven M. Holland, John I. Gallin

Leukocytes,  the  major  cells  comprising  inflammatory  and  immune 
responses,  include  neutrophils,  T  and  B  lymphocytes,  natural  killer 
(NK)  cells,  monocytes,  eosinophils,  and  basophils.  These  cells  have 
specific  functions,  such  as  antibody  production  by  B  lymphocytes 
or  destruction  of  bacteria  by  neutrophils,  but  in  no  single  infectious 
disease is the exact role of the cell types completely established. Thus, 
whereas neutrophils are classically thought to be critical to host defense

against bacteria, they may also play important roles in defense against 
viral infections.

The  blood  delivers  leukocytes  to  the  various  tissues  from  the  bone 
marrow, where they are produced. Normal blood leukocyte counts are 
4.3–10.8  ×  109/L,  with  neutrophils  representing  45–74%  of  the  cells, 
bands  0–4%,  lymphocytes  16–45%,  monocytes  4–10%,  eosinophils 
0–7%, and basophils 0–2%. Variation among individuals and among dif-
ferent ethnic groups can be substantial, with lower leukocyte numbers 
for certain African-American ethnic groups. Lower granulocyte num-
bers  in  African-Americans  are  often  in  the  1500–2000/μL  range  and 
are generally without sequelae. The condition is termed benign ethnic 
neutropenia. The lower number of granulocytes is associated with null 
expression of the Duffy antigen receptor for cytokines (DARC) gene, a 
receptor for malarial parasites, the absence of which conveys resistance 
to  malaria.  The  various  leukocytes  are  derived  from  a  common  stem 
cell  in  the  bone  marrow.  Three-fourths  of  the  nucleated  cells  of  bone 
marrow  are  committed  to  the  production  of  leukocytes.  Leukocyte 
maturation in the marrow is under the regulatory control of a number 
of  different  factors,  known  as  colony-stimulating  factors  (CSFs)  and 
interleukins (ILs). Because an alteration in the number and type of leu-
kocytes is often associated with disease processes, total white blood cell 
(WBC) count (cells per μL) and differential counts are informative. This 
chapter focuses on neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils. Lympho-
cytes and basophils are discussed in Chaps. 349 and 353, respectively.

NEUTROPHILS
 ■ MATURATION
Important  events  in  neutrophil  life  are  summarized  in  Fig.  64-1.  In 
normal  humans,  neutrophils  are  produced  only  in  the  bone  marrow. 
The  minimum  number  of  stem  cells  necessary  to  support  hemato-
poiesis  is  estimated  to  be  400–500  at  any  one  time.  Human  blood 
monocytes, tissue macrophages, and stromal cells produce CSFs, hor-
mones  required  for  the  growth  of  monocytes  and  neutrophils  in  the 
bone  marrow.  The  hematopoietic  system  not  only  produces  enough 
neutrophils (∼1.3 × 1011 cells per 80-kg person per day) to carry out 
physiologic functions but also has a large reserve stored in the marrow, 
which can be mobilized in response to inflammation or infection. An 
increase in the number of blood neutrophils is called neutrophilia, and 
the presence of immature cells is termed a shift to the left. A decrease in 
the number of blood neutrophils is called neutropenia.

Neutrophils  and  monocytes  evolve  from  pluripotent  stem  cells 
under the influence of cytokines and CSFs (Fig. 64-2). The prolifera-
tion phase through the metamyelocyte takes about 1 week, while the 
maturation  phase  from  metamyelocyte  to  mature  neutrophil  takes 
another  week.  The  myeloblast  is  the  first  recognizable  precursor  cell 
and is followed by the promyelocyte. The promyelocyte evolves when 
the classic lysosomal granules, called the primary, or azurophil, gran-
ules  are  produced.  The  primary  granules  contain  hydrolases,  elastase, 
myeloperoxidase,  cathepsin  G,  cationic  proteins,  and  bactericidal/ 
permeability-increasing  protein,  which  is  important  for  killing 
gram-negative  bacteria.  Azurophil  granules  also  contain  defensins,  a 
family of cysteine-rich polypeptides with broad antimicrobial activity 
against bacteria, fungi and certain enveloped viruses. The promyelocyte 
divides to produce the myelocyte, a cell responsible for the synthesis of 
the  specific,  or  secondary,  granules,  which  contain  unique  (specific) 
constituents  such  as  lactoferrin,  vitamin  B12–binding  protein,  mem-
brane components of the reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate  (NADPH)  oxidase  required  for  hydrogen  peroxide  pro-
duction, histaminase, and receptors for certain chemoattractants and 
adherence-promoting factors (CR3) as well as receptors for the base-
ment membrane component, laminin. The secondary granules do not 
contain acid hydrolases and therefore are not classic lysosomes. Pack-
aging of secondary granule contents during myelopoiesis is controlled 
by  CCAAT/enhancer  binding  protein-ε.  Secondary  granule  contents 
are readily released extracellularly, and their mobilization is important in 
modulating inflammation. During the final stages of maturation, no cell 
division occurs, and the cell passes through the metamyelocyte stage and 
then to the band neutrophil with a sausage-shaped nucleus (Fig. 64-3).  
As the band cell matures, the nucleus assumes a lobulated configura-
tion. The nucleus of neutrophils normally contains up to four segments 
(Fig. 64-4). Excessive segmentation (>5 nuclear lobes) may be a man-
ifestation of folate or vitamin B12 deficiency or the congenital neutro-
penia  syndrome  of  warts,  hypogammaglobulinemia,  infections,  and 
myelokathexis  (WHIM)  described  below.  The  Pelger-Hüet  anomaly 
(Fig. 64-5), an infrequent dominant benign inherited trait caused by 
heterozygous mutations in the lamin B receptor, results in neutrophils 
with distinctive bilobed nuclei that must be distinguished from band 
forms.  Acquired  bilobed  nuclei,  pseudo-Pelger-Hüet  anomaly,  can 
occur  with  acute  infections  or  in  myelodysplastic  syndromes.  The 
physiologic  role  of  the  normal  multilobed  nucleus  of  neutrophils  is

In  severe  acute  bacterial  infection,  prominent  neutrophil  cyto-
plasmic  granules,  called  toxic  granulations,  are  occasionally  seen.

Toxic  granulations  are  immature  or  abnormally 
staining azurophil granules. Cytoplasmic inclusions, 
also  called  Döhle  bodies  (Fig.  64-3),  can  be  seen 
during infection and are fragments of ribosome-rich 
endoplasmic  reticulum.  Large  neutrophil  vacuoles 
are  often  present  in  acute  bacterial  infection  in 
some  viral  infections  such  as  COVID-19  and  proba-
bly  represent  pinocytosed  (internalized)  membrane  
(Fig. 64-6).

Neutrophils  are  heterogeneous  in  function.  Mono-
clonal  antibodies  have  been  developed  that  recognize 
only  a  subset  of  mature  neutrophils.  The  meaning  of 
neutrophil heterogeneity is not known.

The  morphology  of  eosinophils  and  basophils  is 

shown in Fig. 64-7.
 ■ MARROW RELEASE AND 
CIRCULATING COMPARTMENTS
Specific  signals,  including  IL-1,  tumor  necrosis  factor 
α  (TNF-α),  the  CSFs,  complement  fragments,  and 
chemokines,  mobilize  leukocytes  from  the  bone  mar-
row and deliver them to the blood in an unstimulated 
state. Under normal conditions, ∼90% of the neutrophil 
pool  is  in  the  bone  marrow,  2–3%  in  the  circulation, 
and the remainder in the tissues (Fig. 64-8).

The  circulating  pool  exists  in  two  dynamic  com-
partments: one freely flowing and one marginated. The 
freely flowing pool is about one-half the neutrophils in 
the basal state and is composed of those cells that are 
in the blood and not in contact with the endothelium. 
Marginated leukocytes are those that are in close phys-
ical  contact  with  the  endothelium  (Fig.  64-9).  In  the 
pulmonary  circulation,  where  an  extensive  capillary 
bed (∼1000 capillaries per alveolus) exists, margination 
occurs because the capillaries are about the same size as 
a mature neutrophil. Therefore, neutrophil fluidity and 
deformability are necessary to make the transit through 
the  pulmonary  bed.  Increased  neutrophil  rigidity  and 

FIGURE  64-3  Neutrophil  band  with  Döhle  body.  The  neutrophil  with  a  sausage-
shaped nucleus in the center of the field is a band form. Döhle bodies are discrete, 
blue-staining,  nongranular  areas  found  in  the  periphery  of  the  cytoplasm  of  the 
neutrophil in infections and other toxic states. They represent aggregates of rough 
endoplasmic reticulum. 

FIGURE  64-4  Normal  granulocyte.  The  normal  granulocyte  has  a  segmented 
nucleus with heavy, clumped chromatin; fine neutrophilic granules are dispersed

FIGURE  64-5  Pelger-Hüet  anomaly.  In  this  benign  disorder,  the  majority  of 
granulocytes are bilobed. The nucleus frequently has a spectacle-like, or “pince-nez,” 
configuration. (From M Lichtman et al (eds): Williams Hematology, 7th ed. New York,  
McGraw  Hill,  2005;  RS  Hillman,  KA  Ault:  Hematology  in  General  Practice,  4th  ed.

decreased  deformability  lead  to  augmented  neutrophil  trapping  and 
margination  in  the  lung.  In  contrast,  in  the  systemic  postcapillary 
venules,  margination  is  mediated  by  the  interaction  of  specific  cell-
surface molecules called selectins. Selectins are glycoproteins expressed 
on neutrophils and endothelial cells, among others, that cause a low- 
affinity  interaction,  resulting  in  “rolling”  of  the  neutrophil  along  the 
endothelial  surface.  On  neutrophils,  the  molecule  L-selectin  (cluster 
determinant [CD] 62L) binds to glycosylated proteins on endothelial 
cells (e.g., glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule [GlyCAM1] 
and CD34). Glycoproteins on neutrophils, most importantly sialyl-Lewisx 
(SLex, CD15s), are targets for binding of selectins expressed on endo-
thelial  cells  (E-selectin  [CD62E]  and  P-selectin  [CD62P])  and  other 
leukocytes.  In  response  to  chemotactic  stimuli  from  injured  tissues 
(e.g., complement product C5a, leukotriene B4, IL-8) or bacterial prod-
ucts  (e.g.,  N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine  [f-met-leu-phe]), 
neutrophil adhesiveness increases through mobilization of intracellular 
adhesion  proteins  stored  in  specific  granules  to  the  cell  surface,  and 
the  cells  “stick”  to  the  endothelium  through  integrins.  The  integrins 
are  leukocyte  glycoproteins  that  exist  as  complexes  of  a  common 
CD18  β  chain  with  CD11a  (LFA-1),  CD11b  (called  Mac-1,  CR3,  or 
the C3bi receptor), and CD11c (called p150,95 or CR4). CD11a/CD18 
and CD11b/CD18 bind to specific endothelial receptors (intercellular 
adhesion molecules [ICAM] 1 and 2).

On cell stimulation, L-selectin is shed from neutrophils, and E-selectin 
increases  in  the  blood,  presumably  because  it  is  shed  from  endothe-
lial  cells;  receptors  for  chemoattractants  and  opsonins  are  mobilized; 
and  the  phagocytes  orient  toward  the  chemoattractant  source  in  the 
extravascular  space,  increase  their  motile  activity  (chemokinesis), 

and  migrate  directionally  (chemotaxis)  into  tissues.  The  process  of 
migration into tissues is called diapedesis and involves the crawling of 
neutrophils between postcapillary endothelial cells that open junctions 
between adjacent cells to permit leukocyte passage. Diapedesis involves 
platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1 (CD31), which 
is  expressed  on  both  the  emigrating  leukocyte  and  the  endothelial 
cells. The endothelial responses (increased blood flow from increased 
vasodilation  and  permeability)  are  mediated  by  anaphylatoxins  (e.g., 
C3a  and  C5a)  as  well  as  vasodilators  such  as  histamine,  bradykinin, 
serotonin,  nitric  oxide,  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF), 
and prostaglandins E and I. Cytokines regulate some of these processes 
(e.g., TNF-α induction of VEGF, interferon [IFN] γ inhibition of pros-
taglandin E).

In the healthy adult, most neutrophils leave the body by migration 
through the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal tract. Normally, 
neutrophils  spend  a  short  time  in  the  circulation  (half-life,  6–7  h). 
Senescent  neutrophils  are  cleared  from  the  circulation  by  macro-
phages in the lung and spleen. Once in the tissues, neutrophils release 
enzymes,  such  as  collagenase  and  elastase,  which  may  help  establish 
abscess cavities. Neutrophils ingest pathogenic materials that have been 
opsonized  by  IgG  and  C3b.  Fibronectin  and  the  tetrapeptide  tuftsin 
also facilitate phagocytosis.

With  phagocytosis  comes  a  burst  of  oxygen  consumption  and 
activation  of  the  hexose-monophosphate  shunt.  A  membrane- 
associated  NADPH  oxidase,  consisting  of  membrane  and  cytosolic 
components,  is  assembled  and  catalyzes  the  univalent  reduction  of 
oxygen  to  superoxide  anion,  which  is  then  converted  by  superoxide 
dismutase to hydrogen peroxide and other toxic oxygen products (e.g.,

cationic  proteins,  defensins,  elastase,  cathepsins,  and  probably  nitric 
oxide also participate in microbial killing. Lactoferrin chelates iron, an 
important  growth  factor  for  microorganisms,  especially  fungi.  Other 
enzymes,  such  as  lysozyme  and  acid  proteases,  help  digest  microbial 
debris.  After  1–4  days  in  tissues,  neutrophils  die.  The  apoptosis  of 
neutrophils is also cytokine-regulated; granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor  (G-CSF)  and  IFN-γ  prolong  their  life  span.  Neutrophil  extra-
cellular  traps  (NETs)  consisting  of  a  DNA  scaffold  decorated  with 
neutrophil-granule derived proteins, such as enzymatically active pro-
teases and antimicrobial peptides, have been described recently and are 
thought to be formed as a defense mechanism to immobilize invading 
microorganisms.  Under  certain  conditions,  such  as  in  delayed-type 
hypersensitivity,  monocyte  accumulation  occurs  within  6–12  h  of 
initiation  of  inflammation.  Neutrophils,  monocytes,  microorganisms 
in various states of digestion, and altered local tissue cells make up the 
inflammatory exudate, pus. Myeloperoxidase confers the characteristic 
green color to pus and may participate in turning off the inflammatory 
process by inactivating chemoattractants and immobilizing phagocytic 
cells.

Neutrophils  respond  to  certain  cytokines  (IFN-γ,  granulocyte- 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], IL-8) and produce 
cytokines and chemotactic signals (TNF-α, IL-8, macrophage inflam-
matory protein [MIP] 1) that modulate the inflammatory response. In 
the presence of fibrinogen, f-met-leu-phe or leukotriene B4 IL-8 pro-
duction by neutrophils is induced, providing autocrine amplification of 
inflammation. Chemokines (chemoattractant cytokines) are small pro-
teins produced by many different cell types, including endothelial cells, 
fibroblasts,  epithelial  cells,  neutrophils,  and  monocytes,  that  regulate 
neutrophil,  monocyte,  eosinophil,  and  lymphocyte  recruitment  and 
activation. Chemokines transduce their signals through heterotrimeric 
G protein–linked receptors that have seven cell membrane–spanning 
domains,  the  same  type  of  cell-surface  receptor  that  mediates  the 
response to the classic chemoattractants f-met-leu-phe and C5a. Four 
major  groups  of  chemokines  are  recognized  based  on  the  cysteine 
structure  near  the  N  terminus:  C,  CC, 
CXC,  and  CXXXC.  The  CXC  cytokines 
such  as  IL-8  mainly  attract  neutrophils; 
CC  chemokines  such  as  MIP-1  attract 
lymphocytes,  monocytes,  eosinophils, 
and  basophils;  the  C  chemokine  lym-
photactin  is  T-cell  tropic;  the  CXXXC 
chemokine 
fractalkine  attracts  neu-
trophils,  monocytes,  and  T  cells.  These 
molecules  and  their  receptors  not  only 
regulate the trafficking and activation of 
inflammatory cells, but specific chemok-
ine  receptors  also  serve  as  co-receptors 
for  HIV  infection  (Chap.  202),  while 
others have roles in other viral infections 
(e.g., West Nile virus), susceptibility and 
response to Candida, and atherogenesis.

FIGURE  64-9  Neutrophil  travel  through  the  pulmonary  capillaries  is  dependent  on  neutrophil  deformability. 
Neutrophil rigidity (e.g., caused by C5a) enhances pulmonary trapping and response to pulmonary pathogens in a 
way that is not so dependent on cell-surface receptors. Intraalveolar chemotactic factors, such as those caused 
by  certain  bacteria  (e.g.,  Streptococcus  pneumoniae),  lead  to  diapedesis  of  neutrophils  from  the  pulmonary 
capillaries into the alveolar space. Neutrophil interaction with the endothelium of the systemic postcapillary venules 
is dependent on molecules of attachment. The neutrophil “rolls” along the endothelium using selectins: neutrophil 
CD15s (sialyl-Lewisx) binds to CD62E (E-selectin) and CD62P (P-selectin) on endothelial cells; CD62L (L-selectin) on 
neutrophils binds to CD34 and other molecules (e.g., GlyCAM-1) expressed on endothelium. Chemokines or other 
activation factors stimulate integrin-mediated “tight adhesion”: CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) and CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1, CR3) 
bind to CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD102 (ICAM-2) on the endothelium. Diapedesis occurs between endothelial cells: CD31 
(PECAM-1) expressed by the emigrating neutrophil interacts with CD31 expressed at the endothelial cell-cell junction.

 ■ NEUTROPHIL 
ABNORMALITIES
Defects  in  the  neutrophil  life  cycle  can 
lead  to  dysfunction  and  compromised 
host  defenses.  When  inflammation  is 
severely  depressed  the  clinical  result 
is  often  recurrent,  severe  bacterial  and 
fungal  infections.    Aphthous  ulcers  of 
mucous  membranes  (gray  ulcers  with-
out  pus)  and  gingivitis  and  periodontal 
disease  suggest  a  phagocytic  cell  disor-
der.  Patients  with  congenital  phagocyte 
defects  can  have  infections  within  the 
first few days of life. Skin, ear, upper and 
lower  respiratory  tract,  and  bone  infec-
tions are common. Sepsis and meningitis 
are rare. In some disorders, the frequency

of infection is variable, and patients can go for months or even years 
without  major  infection.  Aggressive  management  of  these  congenital 
diseases,  including  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  and  gene 
therapy, has extended the life span of patients well into adulthood.

Neutropenia  The  consequences  of  absent  neutrophils  are  dra-
matic.  Susceptibility  to  infectious  diseases  increases  sharply  when 
neutrophil counts fall to <1000 cells/μL. When the absolute neutrophil 
count  (ANC;  band  forms  and  mature  neutrophils  combined)  falls  to 
<500 cells/μL, control of endogenous microbial flora (e.g., mouth, gut) 
is impaired; when the ANC is <200/μL, the local inflammatory process 
is absent. Neutropenia can be due to depressed production, increased 
peripheral destruction, or excessive peripheral pooling. A falling neu-
trophil  count  or  a  significant  decrease  in  the  number  of  neutrophils 
below steady-state levels, together with a failure to increase neutrophil 
counts in the setting of infection or other challenge, requires investiga-
tion. Acute neutropenia, such as that caused by cancer chemotherapy, 
is  more  likely  to  be  associated  with  increased  risk  of  infection  than 
chronic  neutropenia  (months  to  years)  that  reverses  in  response  to 
infection or carefully controlled administration of endotoxin (see “Lab-
oratory Diagnosis and Management,” below).

Some  causes  of  inherited  and  acquired  neutropenia  are  listed  in 
Table 64-1. The most common neutropenias are iatrogenic, resulting 
from the use of cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapies for malig-
nancy or control of autoimmune disorders. These drugs cause neutro-
penia because they result in decreased production of rapidly growing 
progenitor  (stem)  cells  of  the  marrow.  Certain  antibiotics  such  as 
chloramphenicol,  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,  flucytosine,  vidar-
abine, and the antiretroviral drug zidovudine may cause neutropenia 
by  inhibiting  proliferation  of  myeloid  precursors.  Azathioprine  and 
6-mercaptopurine are metabolized by the enzyme thiopurine methyl-
transferase (TMPT); hypofunctional polymorphisms that are found in 
11% of whites can lead to accumulation of 6-thioguanine and profound 
marrow toxicity. The marrow suppression is generally dose-related and 
dependent on continued administration of the drug. Cessation of the 
offending agent and recombinant human G-CSF usually reverse these 
forms of neutropenia.

Another  important  mechanism  for  iatrogenic  neutropenia  is  the 
effect  of  drugs  that  serve  as  immune  haptens  and  sensitize  neu-
trophils  or  neutrophil  precursors  to  immune-mediated  peripheral

destruction. This form of drug-induced neutropenia can be seen within 
7 days of exposure to the drug; with previous drug exposure, resulting 
in  preexisting  antibodies,  neutropenia  may  occur  a  few  hours  after 
administration of the drug. Although any drug can cause this form of 
neutropenia, the most frequent causes are commonly used antibiotics, 
such as sulfa-containing compounds, penicillins, and cephalosporins. 
Fever  and  eosinophilia  may  also  be  associated  with  drug  reactions, 
but often these signs are not present. Drug-induced neutropenia can 
be severe, but discontinuation of the sensitizing drug is sufficient for 
recovery,  which  is  usually  seen  within  5–7  days  and  is  complete  by 
10 days. Readministration of the sensitizing drug should be avoided, 
because abrupt neutropenia will often result. For this reason, diagnos-
tic challenge should be avoided.

Autoimmune  neutropenias  caused  by  circulating  antineutrophil 
antibodies  are  another  form  of  acquired  neutropenia  that  results  in 
increased destruction of neutrophils. Acquired neutropenia may also 
be  seen  with  viral  infections,  including  acute  infection  with  HIV. 
Acquired neutropenia may be cyclic in nature, occurring at intervals of 
several weeks. Acquired cyclic or stable neutropenia may be associated 
with an expansion of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), which may 
be T cells, NK cells, or NK-like cells. Patients with large granular lym-
phocytosis may have moderate blood and bone marrow lymphocyto-
sis, neutropenia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, splenomegaly, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and absence of lymphadenopathy. Such patients 
may  have  a  chronic  and  relatively  stable  course.  Recurrent  bacterial 
infections are frequent. Benign and malignant forms of this syndrome 
occur. In some patients, a spontaneous regression has occurred even 
after  11  years,  suggesting  an  immunoregulatory  defect  as  the  basis 
for  at  least  one  form  of  the  disorder.  Glucocorticoids,  cyclosporine, 
methotrexate, and monoclonals are commonly used to manage these 
cytopenias.

Hereditary  Neutropenias  Hereditary  neutropenias  are  rare  and 
may manifest in early childhood as a profound constant neutropenia 
or  agranulocytosis.  Congenital  forms  of  neutropenia  include  Kost-
mann’s  syndrome  (neutrophil  count  <100/μL),  which  is  often  fatal 
and due to mutations in the antiapoptosis gene HAX-1; severe chronic 
neutropenia  (neutrophil  count  of  300–1500/μL)  due  to  mutations  in 
neutrophil elastase (ELANE); hereditary cyclic neutropenia, or, more 
appropriately, cyclic hematopoiesis, also due to mutations in neutrophil 
elastase  (ELANE);  the  cartilage-hair  hypoplasia  syndrome  due  to 
mutations  in  the  mitochondrial  RNA-processing  endoribonuclease 
RMRP;  Shwachman-Diamond  syndrome  associated  with  pancreatic 
insufficiency  due  to  mutations  in  the  Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond 
syndrome  gene  SBDS;  the  WHIM  (warts,  hypogammaglobulinemia, 
infections,  myelokathexis  [retention  of  WBCs  in  the  marrow])  syn-
drome,  characterized  by  neutrophil  hypersegmentation  and  bone 
marrow  myeloid  arrest  due  to  mutations  in  the  chemokine  receptor 
CXCR4;  and  neutropenias  associated  with  other  immune  defects, 
such  as  GATA2  deficiency,  X-linked  agammaglobulinemia,  Wiskott- 
Aldrich syndrome, and CD40 ligand deficiency. Mutations in the G-CSF 
receptor can develop in severe congenital neutropenia and are linked to 
the development of leukemia. Absence of both myeloid and lymphoid 
cells  is  seen  in  reticular  dysgenesis,  due  to  mutations  in  the  nuclear 
genome-encoded mitochondrial enzyme adenylate kinase-2 (AK2).

Maternal  factors  can  be  associated  with  neutropenia  in  the  new-
born. Transplacental transfer of IgG directed against antigens on fetal 
neutrophils can result in peripheral destruction. Drugs (e.g., thiazides) 
ingested during pregnancy can cause neutropenia in the newborn by 
either depressed production or peripheral destruction.

In Felty’s syndrome—the triad of rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, 
and neutropenia (Chap. 358)—spleen-produced antibodies can shorten 
neutrophil life span, while large granular lymphocytes can attack mar-
row  neutrophil  precursors.  Splenectomy  may  increase  the  neutrophil 
count  in  Felty’s  syndrome  and  lower  serum  neutrophil-binding  IgG. 
Some  Felty’s  syndrome  patients  also  have  autoantibodies  to  G-CSF, 
while  others  have  increased  numbers  of  LGLs.  Splenomegaly  with 
peripheral trapping and destruction of neutrophils is also seen in lys-
osomal storage diseases and commonly in portal hypertension.

Neutrophilia  Neutrophilia  results  from  increased  neutrophil 
production,  increased  marrow  release,  or  defective  margination 
(Table  64-2).  The  most  important  acute  cause  of  neutrophilia  is 
infection. Neutrophilia from acute infection represents both increased 
production and increased marrow release. Increased production is also 
associated  with  chronic  inflammation  and  certain  myeloproliferative 
diseases. Increased marrow release and mobilization of the marginated 
leukocyte pool are induced by glucocorticoids. Release of epinephrine, 
as  with  vigorous  exercise,  excitement,  or  stress,  will  demarginate 
neutrophils in the spleen and lungs and double the neutrophil count 
in  minutes.  Cigarette  smoking  can  elevate  neutrophil  counts  above 
the normal range. Leukocytosis with cell counts of 10,000–25,000/μL 
occurs in response to infection and other forms of acute inflammation 
and  results  from  both  release  of  the  marginated  pool  and  mobiliza-
tion  of  marrow  reserves.  Persistent  neutrophilia  with  cell  counts  of 
≥30,000–50,000/μL is called a leukemoid reaction, a term often used to 
distinguish this degree of neutrophilia from leukemia. In a leukemoid 
reaction, the circulating neutrophils are usually mature and not clon-
ally derived.

Abnormal Neutrophil Function 
Inherited and acquired abnor-
malities of phagocyte function are listed in Table 64-3. The resulting 
diseases  are  best  considered  in  terms  of  the  functional  defects  of 
adherence,  chemotaxis,  and  microbicidal  activity.  The  distinguishing 
features of the important inherited disorders of phagocyte function are 
shown in Table 64-4.
DISORDERS  OF  ADHESION  Three  main  types  of  leukocyte  adhesion 
deficiency  (LAD)  have  been  described.  All  are  autosomal  recessive 
and result in the inability of neutrophils to exit the circulation to sites 
of  infection,  leading  to  leukocytosis  and  increased  susceptibility  to 
infection  (Fig.  64-9).  Patients  with  LAD  1  have  mutations  in  CD18, 
the common component of the integrins LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150,95, 
leading  to  a  defect  in  tight  adhesion  between  neutrophils  and  the 
endothelium.  The  heterodimer  formed  by  CD18/CD11b  (Mac-1)  is 
also  the  receptor  for  the  complement-derived  opsonin  C3bi  (CR3). 
The CD18 gene is located on distal chromosome 21q. The severity of 
the defect determines the severity of clinical disease. Complete lack of 
expression of the leukocyte integrins results in a severe phenotype in 
which inflammatory stimuli do not increase the expression of leuko-
cyte  integrins  on  neutrophils  or  activated  T  and  B  cells.  Neutrophils 
(and monocytes) from patients with LAD 1 adhere poorly to endothe-
lial cells and protein-coated surfaces and exhibit defective spreading, 
aggregation,  and  chemotaxis.  The  inability  of  neutrophils  to  exit  the 
vasculature to the tissue deprives the tissue macrophage of its expected 
neutrophil  ingestion,  leading  to  macrophage  production  of  IL-23, 
which  induces  T-cell  production  of  IL-17,  a  potent  proinflammatory 
cytokine.  These  processes  conspire  to  drive  inflammation  in  LAD  1. 
Patients with LAD 1 have recurrent bacterial infections involving the 
skin,  oral  and  genital  mucosa,  and  respiratory  and  intestinal  tracts; 
persistent  leukocytosis  (resting  neutrophil  counts  of  15,000–20,000/
μL) because cells do not marginate; and, in severe cases, a history of 
delayed  separation  of  the  umbilical  stump.  Infections,  especially  of 
the  skin,  may  become  necrotic  with  progressively  enlarging  borders, 
slow healing, and development of dysplastic scars. The most common 
bacteria are Staphylococcus aureus and enteric gram-negative bacteria. 
LAD 2 is  caused by  an abnormality  of fucosylation of SLex (CD15s), 
the  ligand  on  neutrophils  that  interacts  with  selectins  on  endothelial 
cells and is responsible for neutrophil rolling along the endothelium. 
Infection susceptibility in LAD 2 appears to be less severe than in 
LAD 1. LAD 2 is also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation IIc 
(CDGIIc)  due  to  mutation  in  a  GDP-fucose  transporter  (SLC35C1). 
LAD  3  is  characterized  by  infection  susceptibility,  leukocytosis,  and 
petechial  hemorrhage  due  to  impaired  integrin  activation  caused  by 
mutations in the gene FERMT3.
DISORDERS  OF  NEUTROPHIL  GRANULES  The  most  common  neu-
trophil defect is myeloperoxidase deficiency, a primary granule defect 
inherited as an autosomal recessive trait; the incidence is ∼1 in 2000 
persons.  Isolated  myeloperoxidase  deficiency  is  not  associated  with

for all patients with CGD. Two proteins (a 91-kDa protein, abnormal 
in X-linked CGD, and a 22-kDa protein, absent in one form of auto-
somal recessive CGD) form the heterodimer cytochrome b-558 in the 
plasma membrane. The protein essential for reactive oxidant signaling 
(EROS) is encoded by CYBC1, which is required to transport the 91- 
and 22-kDa proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. Three other pro-
teins (40, 47, and 67 kDa, abnormal in the other autosomal recessive 
forms of CGD) are cytoplasmic in origin and interact with the cyto-
chrome after cell activation to form the NADPH oxidase, required for 
hydrogen  peroxide  production.  Leukocytes  from  patients  with  CGD 
have  severely  diminished  hydrogen  peroxide  production.  The  genes 
involved in each of the defects have been cloned and sequenced and 
the  chromosome  locations  identified.  Patients  with  CGD  character-
istically have increased numbers of infections due to catalase-positive 
microorganisms (organisms that destroy their own hydrogen peroxide) 
such as S. aureus, Serratia marsescens, Burkholderia cepacia complex, 
Nocardia  and  Aspergillus  species.  When  patients  with  CGD  become 
infected,  they  often  have  extensive  inflammatory  reactions,  and  sup-
puration is common despite the administration of appropriate antibi-
otics. Aphthous ulcers and chronic inflammation of the nares are often 
present. Granulomas are frequent and can obstruct the gastrointestinal 
or genitourinary tracts. The excessive inflammation is due to failure to 
downregulate inflammation, reflecting a failure to inhibit the synthesis 
of, degradation of, or response to ILs or chemoattractants, leading to 
persistent myeloid reaction. Impaired killing of intracellular microor-
ganisms by macrophages may lead to persistent cell-mediated immune 
activation and granuloma formation. Autoimmune complications such 
as immune thrombocytopenic purpura and juvenile idiopathic arthri-
tis are also increased in CGD. In addition, for unexplained reasons, dis-
coid lupus is more common in X-linked carriers. Late complications, 
including  nodular  regenerative  hyperplasia  and  portal  hypertension, 
are increasingly recognized in adolescent and adult patients with CGD. 
Interestingly,  patients  with  CGD  have  been  reported  to  be  protected 
from atherosclerosis, suggesting an important role for NADPH oxidase 
(NOX2) in the pathogenesis of this inflammatory disease of arteries.
DISORDERS  OF  PHAGOCYTE  ACTIVATION  Phagocytes  depend  on 
cell-surface  stimulation  to  induce  signals  that  evoke  multiple  levels 
of  the  inflammatory  response,  including  cytokine  synthesis,  che-
motaxis,  and  antigen  presentation.  Mutations  affecting  the  major 
pathway  that  signals  through  NF-κB  have  been  noted  in  patients 
with a variety of infection susceptibility syndromes. If the defects are 
at a very late stage of signal transduction, in the protein critical for 
NF-κB activation known as the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), 
then affected males develop ectodermal dysplasia and severe immune 
deficiency  with  susceptibility  to  bacteria,  fungi,  mycobacteria,  and 
viruses. If the defects in NF-κB activation are closer to the cell-surface 
receptors, in the proteins transducing Toll-like receptor signals, IL-1 
receptor–associated  kinase  4  (IRAK4),  and  myeloid  differentiation 
primary  response  gene  88  (MyD88),  then  children  have  a  marked 
susceptibility to pyogenic infections early in life but develop resistance 
to infection later.
MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES
The  mononuclear  phagocyte  system  is  composed  of  monoblasts, 
promonocytes, and monocytes, in addition to the structurally diverse 
tissue  macrophages  that  make  up  what  was  previously  referred  to  as 
the reticuloendothelial system. Macrophages are long-lived phagocytic 
cells  capable  of  many  of  the  functions  of  neutrophils.  They  are  also 
secretory  cells  that  participate  in  many  immunologic  and  inflamma-
tory processes distinct from neutrophils. Monocytes leave the circula-
tion by diapedesis more slowly than neutrophils and have a half-life in 
the blood of 12–24 h.

Many tissue macrophages (“big eaters”) arise even before hemato-
poiesis and take up residence in tissues. In addition, there are macro-
phages derived from monocytes, which may have specialized functions 
suited  for  specific  anatomic  locations.  Macrophages  are  particularly 
abundant in capillary walls of the lung, spleen, liver, and bone marrow, 
where  they  function  to  remove  microorganisms  and  other  noxious 
elements  from  the  blood.  Alveolar  macrophages,  liver  Kupffer  cells, 

FIGURE  64-10  Chédiak-Higashi  syndrome.  The  granulocytes  contain  huge 
cytoplasmic  granules  formed  from  aggregation  and  fusion  of  azurophilic  and 
specific granules. Large abnormal granules are found in other granule-containing 
cells throughout the body. 

clinically compromised defenses, presumably because other defense sys-
tems such as hydrogen peroxide generation are amplified. Microbicidal 
activity of neutrophils is delayed but not absent. Myeloperoxidase defi-
ciency may make other acquired host defense defects more serious, and 
patients with myeloperoxidase deficiency and diabetes are more suscep-
tible to Candida infections. An acquired form of myeloperoxidase defi-
ciency occurs in myelomonocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia.
Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare disease with autosomal 
recessive inheritance due to defects in the lysosomal transport protein 
LYST, encoded by the gene CHS1 at 1q42. This protein is required for 
normal packaging and disbursement of granules. Neutrophils (and all 
cells containing lysosomes) from patients with CHS characteristically 
have large granules (Fig. 64-10), making it a systemic disease. Patients 
with  CHS  have  nystagmus,  partial  oculocutaneous  albinism,  and  an 
increased number of infections resulting from many bacterial agents. 
Some CHS patients develop an “accelerated phase” in childhood with 
a  hemophagocytic  syndrome  and  an  aggressive  lymphoma  requiring 
bone  marrow  transplantation.  CHS  neutrophils  and  monocytes  have 
impaired  chemotaxis  and  abnormal  rates  of  microbial  killing  due  to 
slow  rates  of  fusion  of  the  lysosomal  granules  with  phagosomes.  NK 
cell function is also impaired. CHS patients may develop a severe dis-
abling peripheral neuropathy in adulthood.

Specific granule deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease in 
which the production of secondary granules and their contents, as well 
as the primary granule component defensins, is defective. The defect 
in killing leads to severe bacterial infections. One type of specific gran-
ule deficiency is due to a mutation in the CCAAT/enhancer binding  
protein-ε,  a  regulator  of  expression  of  granule  components.  A  dom-
inant mutation in C/EBP-ε has also been described. Another form is 
caused by mutations in SMARCD2.
CHRONIC  GRANULOMATOUS  DISEASE  Chronic  granulomatous  dis-
ease  (CGD)  is  a  group  of  disorders  of  granulocyte  and  monocyte 
oxidative metabolism due to a defect in the enzyme NADPH oxidase 
also called NOX2. Although CGD is rare, with an incidence of ∼1 in 
200,000  individuals,  it  is  an  important  model  of  defective  neutrophil 
oxidative metabolism. In about two-thirds of patients, CGD is inher-
ited as an X-linked recessive trait; the remainder inherit their disease 
in autosomal recessive patterns. Mutations in the genes for the six pro-
teins that allow assembly at the plasma membrane of NOX2 account

splenic  macrophages,  peritoneal  macrophages,  bone  marrow  macro-
phages,  lymphatic  macrophages,  brain  microglial  cells,  and  dendritic 
macrophages  all  have  specialized  functions.  Macrophage-secreted 
products  include  lysozyme,  neutral  proteases,  acid  hydrolases,  argi-
nase,  complement  components,  enzyme  inhibitors  (plasmin,  α2- 
macroglobulin),  binding  proteins  (transferrin,  fibronectin,  transco-
balamin II), nucleosides, and cytokines (TNF-α; IL-1, 8, 12, 18). IL-1 
(Chaps.  18  and  349)  has  many  functions,  including  initiating  fever 
in  the  hypothalamus,  mobilizing  leukocytes  from  the  bone  marrow, 
and activating lymphocytes and neutrophils. TNF-α is a pyrogen that 
duplicates many of the actions of IL-1 and plays an important role in 
the pathogenesis of gram-negative shock (Chap. 304). TNF-α stimu-
lates production of hydrogen peroxide and related toxic oxygen species 
by macrophages and neutrophils. In addition, TNF-α induces catabolic 
changes that contribute to the profound wasting (cachexia) associated 
with many chronic diseases.

Other  macrophage-secreted  products  include  reactive  oxygen  and 
nitrogen  metabolites,  bioactive  lipids  (arachidonic  acid  metabolites  and 
platelet-activating  factors),  chemokines,  CSFs,  and  factors  stimulating 
fibroblast and vessel proliferation. Macrophages help regulate the replica-
tion of lymphocytes and participate in the killing of tumors, viruses, and 
certain bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes). 
Macrophages  are  key  effector  cells  in  the  elimination  of  intracellular 
microorganisms. Their ability to fuse to form giant cells that coalesce into 
granulomas in response to some inflammatory stimuli is important in the 
elimination of intracellular microbes and is under the control of IFN-γ. 
Nitric oxide induced by IFN-γ may be an important effector against intra-
cellular parasites, including tuberculosis and Leishmania.

Macrophages  play  an  important  role  in  the  immune  response 
(Chap.  349).  They  process  and  present  antigen  to  lymphocytes  and 
secrete  cytokines  that  modulate  and  direct  lymphocyte  development 
and function. Macrophages participate in autoimmune phenomena by 
removing immune complexes and other substances from the circula-
tion.  Polymorphisms  in  macrophage  receptors  for  immunoglobulin 
(FcγRII) determine susceptibility to some infections and autoimmune 
diseases.  In  wound  healing,  they  dispose  of  senescent  cells,  and  they 
also contribute to atheroma development. Macrophage elastase medi-
ates development of emphysema from cigarette smoking.

 ■ DISORDERS OF THE MONONUCLEAR 
PHAGOCYTE SYSTEM
Many  disorders  of  neutrophils  extend  to  mononuclear  phagocytes. 
Monocytosis is associated with tuberculosis, brucellosis, subacute bac-
terial endocarditis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, malaria, and visceral 
leishmaniasis (kala azar). Monocytosis also occurs with malignancies, 
leukemias, myeloproliferative syndromes, hemolytic anemias, chronic 
idiopathic  neutropenias,  and  granulomatous  diseases  such  as  sarcoi-
dosis, regional enteritis, and some collagen vascular diseases. Patients 
with  LAD,  hyperimmunoglobulin  E–recurrent  infection  (Job’s)  syn-
drome, CHS, and CGD all have defects in the mononuclear phagocyte 
system.

Monocyte  cytokine  production  or  response  is  impaired  in  some 
patients  with  disseminated  nontuberculous  mycobacterial  infection 
who are not infected with HIV. Genetic defects in the pathways reg-
ulated  by  IFN-γ  and  IL-12  lead  to  impaired  killing  of  intracellular 
bacteria, mycobacteria, salmonellae, and certain viruses (Fig. 64-11).

Certain  viral  infections  impair  mononuclear  phagocyte  function. 
For  example,  influenza  virus  infection  causes  abnormal  monocyte 
chemotaxis.  Mononuclear  phagocytes  can  be  infected  by  HIV  using 
CCR5, the chemokine receptor that acts as a co-receptor with CD4 for 
HIV. T lymphocytes produce IFN-γ, which induces FcR expression and 
phagocytosis and stimulates hydrogen peroxide production by mono-
nuclear phagocytes and neutrophils. In certain diseases, such as AIDS, 
IFN-γ production may be deficient, whereas in other diseases, such as 
T-cell lymphomas, excessive release of IFN-γ may be associated with 
erythrophagocytosis by splenic macrophages.

Autoinflammatory diseases are characterized by abnormal cytokine 
regulation, leading to excess inflammation in the absence of infection. 
These diseases can mimic infectious or immunodeficient syndromes.

FIGURE  64-11  Lymphocyte-macrophage  interactions  underlying  resistance  to 
mycobacteria and other intracellular pathogens such as Salmonella, Histoplasma, 
and  Coccidioides.  Mycobacteria  (and  others)  infect  macrophages,  leading  to  the 
production  of  IL-12,  which  activates  T  or  NK  cells  through  its  receptor,  leading 
to  production  of  IL-2  and  IFN-γ.  IFN-γ  acts  through  its  receptor  on  macrophages 
to  upregulate  TNF-γ  and  IL-12  and  kill  intracellular  pathogens.  Other  critical 
interacting  molecules  include  signal  transducer  and  activator  of  transcription  1 
(STAT1), interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), GATA2, and ISG15. Mutant forms of 
the cytokines and receptors shown in bold type have been found in severe cases

pathogens.  AFB,  acid-fast  bacilli;  IFN,  interferon;  IL,  interleukin;  NEMO,  nuclear

Gain-of-function  mutations  in  the  TNF-α  receptor  cause  TNF-α 
receptor–associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), which is character-
ized  by  recurrent  fever  in  the  absence  of  infection,  due  to  persistent 
stimulation of the TNF-α receptor (Chap. 369). Diseases with abnor-
mal  IL-1  regulation  leading  to  fever  include  familial  Mediterranean 
fever  due  to  mutations  in  PYRIN.  Mutations  in  cold-induced  autoin-
flammatory  syndrome  1  (CIAS1)  lead  to  neonatal-onset  multisystem 
autoinflammatory  disease,  familial  cold  urticaria,  and  Muckle-Wells 
syndrome.  The  syndrome  of  pyoderma  gangrenosum,  acne,  and 
sterile pyogenic arthritis (PAPA syndrome) is caused by mutations in 
PSTPIP1. In contrast to these syndromes of overexpression of proin-
flammatory  cytokines,  blockade  of  TNF-α  by  the  antagonists  inflixi-
mab,  adalimumab,  certolizumab,  golimumab,  or  etanercept  has  been 
associated with severe infections due to tuberculosis, nontuberculous 
mycobacteria, and fungi (Chap. 369).

Monocytopenia  occurs  with  acute  infections,  with  stress,  and 
after  treatment  with  glucocorticoids.  Drugs  that  suppress  neutrophil 
production in the bone marrow can cause monocytopenia. Persistent 
severe  circulating  monocytopenia  is  seen  in  GATA2  deficiency,  even 
though  macrophages  are  found  at  the  sites  of  inflammation.  Mono-
cytopenia  also  occurs  in  aplastic  anemia,  hairy  cell  leukemia,  acute 
myeloid leukemia, and as a direct result of myelotoxic drugs.

EOSINOPHILS
Eosinophils and neutrophils share similar morphology, many lysosomal 
constituents,  phagocytic  capacity,  and  oxidative  metabolism.  Eosin-
ophils  express  a  specific  chemoattractant  receptor  and  respond  to  a 
specific  chemokine,  eotaxin,  but  little  is  known  about  their  required 
role.  Eosinophils  are  much  longer  lived  than  neutrophils,  and  unlike 
neutrophils, tissue eosinophils can recirculate. During most infections, 
eosinophils  appear  unimportant.  However,  in  invasive  helminthic 
infections, such as hookworm, schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, toxoc-
ariasis, trichinosis, filariasis, echinococcosis, and cysticercosis, the eos-
inophil plays a central role in host defense. Eosinophils are associated

with bronchial asthma, cutaneous allergic reactions, and other hyper-
sensitivity states.

The distinctive feature of the red-staining (Wright’s stain) eosinophil 
granule  is  its  crystalline  core  consisting  of  an  arginine-rich  protein 
(major  basic  protein)  with  histaminase  activity,  important  in  host 
defense  against  parasites.  Eosinophil  granules  also  contain  a  unique 
eosinophil peroxidase that catalyzes the oxidation of many substances 
by hydrogen peroxide and may facilitate killing of microorganisms.

Eosinophil  peroxidase,  in  the  presence  of  hydrogen  peroxide  and 
halide,  initiates  mast  cell  secretion  in  vitro  and  thereby  promotes 
inflammation.  Eosinophils  contain  cationic  proteins,  some  of  which 
bind  to  heparin  and  reduce  its  anticoagulant  activity.  Eosinophil- 
derived neurotoxin and eosinophil cationic protein are ribonucleases 
that can kill respiratory syncytial virus. Eosinophil cytoplasm contains 
Charcot-Leyden crystal protein, a hexagonal bipyramidal crystal first 
observed  in  a  patient  with  leukemia  and  then  in  sputum  of  patients 
with  asthma;  this  protein  is  lysophospholipase  and  may  function  to 
detoxify certain lysophospholipids.

Several  factors  enhance  the  eosinophil’s  function  in  host  defense. 
T cell–derived factors enhance the ability of eosinophils to kill para-
sites.  Mast  cell–derived  eosinophil  chemotactic  factor  of  anaphylaxis 
(ECFa) increases the number of eosinophil complement receptors and 
enhances  eosinophil  killing  of  parasites.  Eosinophil  CSFs  (e.g.,  IL-5) 
produced by macrophages increase eosinophil production in the bone 
marrow and activate eosinophils to kill parasites.

 ■ EOSINOPHILIA
Eosinophilia is the presence of >500 eosinophils per μL of blood and is 
common in many settings besides parasite infection. Significant tissue 
eosinophilia  can  occur  without  an  elevated  blood  count.  A  common 
cause of eosinophilia is allergic reaction to drugs (iodides, aspirin, sul-
fonamides,  nitrofurantoin,  penicillins,  and  cephalosporins).  Allergies 
such as hay fever, asthma, eczema, serum sickness, allergic vasculitis, 
and  pemphigus  are  associated  with  eosinophilia.  Eosinophilia  also 
occurs in collagen vascular diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, eosin-
ophilic fasciitis, allergic angiitis, and periarteritis nodosa) and malig-
nancies  (e.g.,  Hodgkin’s  disease;  mycosis  fungoides;  chronic  myeloid 
leukemia; and cancer of the lung, stomach, pancreas, ovary, or uterus), 
as well as in STAT3-deficient Job’s syndrome, DOCK8 deficiency (see 
below),  and  CGD.  Eosinophilia  is  commonly  present  in  helminthic 
infections.  IL-5  is  the  dominant  eosinophil  growth  factor.  Thera-
peutic  administration  of  the  cytokines  IL-2  or  GM-CSF  frequently 
leads to transient eosinophilia. The most dramatic hypereosinophilic 
syndromes  are  Loeffler’s  syndrome,  tropical  pulmonary  eosinophilia, 
Loeffler’s  endocarditis,  eosinophilic  leukemia,  and  idiopathic  hyper-
eosinophilic  syndrome  (50,000–100,000/μL).  IL-5  is  the  dominant 
eosinophil  growth  factor  and  can  be  specifically  inhibited  with  the 
monoclonal antibody mepolizumab.

The  idiopathic  hypereosinophilic  syndromes  are  a  heterogeneous 
group of disorders with the common feature of prolonged eosinophilia 
of unknown cause and organ system dysfunction, including the heart, 
central nervous system, kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. 
The bone marrow is involved in all affected individuals, but the most 
severe  complications  involve  the  heart  and  central  nervous  system. 
Clinical  manifestations  and  organ  dysfunction  are  highly  variable. 
Eosinophils  are  found  in  the  involved  tissues  and  likely  cause  tissue 
damage by local deposition of toxic eosinophil proteins such as eosin-
ophil cationic protein and major basic protein. In the heart, the patho-
logic changes lead to thrombosis, endocardial fibrosis, and restrictive 
endomyocardiopathy. The damage to tissues in other organ systems is 
similar. Some cases are due to mutations involving the platelet-derived 
growth factor receptor, and these are extremely sensitive to the tyrosine 
kinase  inhibitor  imatinib.  Glucocorticoids,  hydroxyurea,  and  IFN-α 
each have been used successfully, as have therapeutic antibodies against 
IL-5. Cardiovascular complications are managed aggressively.

The  eosinophilia-myalgia  syndrome  is  a  multisystem  disease,  with 
prominent  cutaneous,  hematologic,  and  visceral  manifestations,  that 
frequently evolves into a chronic course and can occasionally be fatal. 
The  syndrome  is  characterized  by  eosinophilia  (eosinophil  count 

>1000/μL)  and  generalized  disabling  myalgias  without  other  recog-
nized  causes.  Eosinophilic  fasciitis,  pneumonitis,  and  myocarditis; 
neuropathy  culminating  in  respiratory  failure;  and  encephalopathy  may 
occur. The disease is caused by ingesting contaminants in L-tryptophan– 
containing  products.  Eosinophils,  lymphocytes,  macrophages,  and 
fibroblasts accumulate in the affected tissues, but their role in patho-
genesis  is  unclear.  Activation  of  eosinophils  and  fibroblasts  and  the 
deposition  of  eosinophil-derived  toxic  proteins  in  affected  tissues 
may  contribute.  IL-5  and  transforming  growth  factor  β  have  been 
implicated as potential mediators. Treatment is withdrawal of products 
containing  L-tryptophan  and  the  administration  of  glucocorticoids. 
Most patients recover fully, remain stable, or show slow recovery, but 
the disease can be fatal in up to 5% of patients.

Eosinophilic neoplasms are discussed in Chap. 110.

 ■ EOSINOPENIA
Eosinopenia occurs with stress, such as acute bacterial infection, and 
after treatment with glucocorticoids. The mechanism of eosinopenia of 
acute bacterial infection is unknown but is independent of endogenous 
glucocorticoids, because it occurs in animals after total adrenalectomy. 
There is no known adverse effect of eosinopenia.

HYPERIMMUNOGLOBULIN E–RECURRENT 
INFECTION SYNDROME
The  hyperimmunoglobulin  E–recurrent  infection  syndrome,  or  Job’s 
syndrome,  is  a  rare  multisystem  disease  in  which  the  immune  and 
somatic systems are affected, including neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, 
B  cells,  and  osteoclasts.  Autosomal  dominant  inhibitory  mutations 
in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) lead to 
inhibition of normal STAT signaling with broad and profound effects. 
Patients  have  characteristic  facies  with  broad  nose,  kyphoscoliosis, 
and eczema. The primary teeth erupt normally but do not deciduate, 
often requiring extraction. Patients develop recurrent sinopulmonary 
and  cutaneous  infections  that  tend  to  be  much  less  inflamed  than 
appropriate  for  the  degree  of  infection  and  have  been  referred  to 
as  “cold  abscesses.”  Characteristically,  pneumonias  cavitate,  leading 
to  pneumatoceles.  Coronary  artery  aneurysms  are  common,  as  are 
cerebral demyelinated plaques that accumulate with age. Importantly, 
IL-17–producing T cells, which are thought responsible for protection 
against  extracellular  and  mucosal  infections,  are  profoundly  reduced 
in  Job’s  syndrome.  Despite  very  high  IgE  levels,  these  patients  have 
only  mildly  elevated  levels  of  allergy.  An  important  syndrome  with 
clinical overlap with the dominant negative STAT3 deficiency is due to 
autosomal recessive defects in dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8). In 
DOCK8 deficiency, IgE elevation is joined to severe allergy, viral sus-
ceptibility, and increased rates of cancer. Autosomal dominant gain-of-
function mutations in STAT3 lead to a disease characterized by onset in 
childhood  of  lymphadenopathy,  autoimmune  cytopenias,  multiorgan 
autoimmunity, infections, and interstitial lung disease.

LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS AND 
MANAGEMENT
Initial  studies  of  WBC  and  differential  are  essential,  and  careful 
examination of neutrophils on peripheral blood smears can diagnose 
Chediak-Higashi  syndrome  and  suggest  other  neutrophil  granule 
abnormalities  such  as  specific  granule  deficiency.  Often  a  bone  mar-
row examination and serologies may be followed by either gene panel 
or whole exome sequencing in the cases of suspected genetic defects. 
Functionally,  assessment  of  bone  marrow  reserves  (steroid  challenge 
test), marginated circulating pool of cells (epinephrine challenge test), 
and marginating ability (endotoxin challenge test) (Fig. 64-8) are also 
doable. In vivo assessment of inflammation is possible with a Rebuck 
skin window test or an in vivo skin blister assay, which measures the 
ability of leukocytes and inflammatory mediators to accumulate locally 
in the skin. In vitro tests of phagocyte aggregation, adherence, chemo-
taxis,  phagocytosis,  degranulation,  and  microbicidal  activity  (for  S. 
aureus) may help pinpoint cellular or humoral lesions. Deficiencies of 
oxidative metabolism are detected with either the nitroblue tetrazolium 
(NBT) dye test or the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) oxidation test. These

tests  are  based  on  the  ability  of  products  of  oxidative  metabolism  to 
alter  the  oxidation  states  of  reporter  molecules  so  that  they  can  be 
detected  microscopically  (NBT)  or  by  flow  cytometry  (DHR).  Qual-
itative  studies  of  superoxide  and  hydrogen  peroxide  production  may 
further define neutrophil oxidative function.

Patients  with  leukopenias  or  leukocyte  dysfunction  often  have 
delayed  inflammatory  responses.  Therefore,  clinical  manifestations 
may  be  minimal  despite  overwhelming  infection,  and  unusual  infec-
tions  must  always  be  suspected.  Early  signs  of  infection  demand 
prompt,  aggressive  culturing  for  microorganisms,  use  of  antibiotics, 
and  drainage  of  abscesses.  Prolonged  courses  of  antibiotics  are  often 
required. In patients with CGD, prophylactic antibiotics (trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole)  and  antifungals  (itraconazole)  markedly  diminish 
the  frequency  of  life-threatening  infections.  Glucocorticoids  may 
relieve  gastrointestinal  or  genitourinary  tract  obstruction  by  granu-
lomas  in  patients  with  CGD.  Although  TNF-α-blocking  agents  may 
markedly relieve inflammatory bowel symptoms, extreme caution must 
be exercised in their use in CGD inflammatory bowel disease, because 
it profoundly increases these patients’ already heightened susceptibility 
to infection. Recombinant human IFN-γ, which nonspecifically stim-
ulates  phagocytic  cell  function,  reduces  the  frequency  of  infections 
in  patients  with  CGD  by  70%  and  reduces  the  severity  of  infection. 
This  effect  of  IFN-γ  in  CGD  is  additive  to  the  effect  of  prophylactic 
antibiotics. The recommended dose is 50 μg/m2 subcutaneously three 
times weekly. IFN-γ has also been used successfully in the treatment 
of leprosy, nontuberculous mycobacteria, and visceral leishmaniasis.

Rigorous oral hygiene reduces but does not eliminate the discomfort 
of  gingivitis,  periodontal  disease,  and  aphthous  ulcers;  chlorhexidine 
mouthwash  and  tooth  brushing  with  a  hydrogen  peroxide–sodium 
bicarbonate  paste  also  helps  many  patients.  Oral  antifungal  agents 
(fluconazole,  itraconazole,  voriconazole,  posaconazole)  have  reduced 
mucocutaneous  candidiasis  in  patients  with  Job’s  syndrome.  Andro-
gens,  glucocorticoids,  lithium,  and  immunosuppressive  therapy  have 
been  used  to  restore  myelopoiesis  in  patients  with  neutropenia  due 
to  impaired  production.  Recombinant  G-CSF  is  useful  in  the  man-
agement of certain forms of neutropenia due to depressed neutrophil 
production, including those related to cancer chemotherapy. Patients 
with  chronic  neutropenia  with  evidence  of  a  good  bone  marrow 
reserve need not receive prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with chronic 
or  cyclic  neutrophil  counts  <500/μL  may  benefit  from  prophylactic 
antibiotics and G-CSF during periods of neutropenia. Oral trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole  (160/800  mg)  twice  daily  can  prevent  infection. 
Increased  numbers  of  fungal  infections  are  not  seen  in  patients  with 
CGD on this regimen. Oral quinolones such as levofloxacin and cipro-
floxacin are alternatives.

In  the  setting  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  with  severe,  persistent 
lymphocyte  dysfunction,  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  prevents 
Pneumocystis  jiroveci  pneumonia.  These  patients,  and  patients  with 
phagocytic cell dysfunction, should avoid heavy exposure to airborne 
soil, dust, or decaying matter (mulch, manure), which are often rich in 
Nocardia and the spores of Aspergillus and other fungi. Restriction of 
activities or social contact has no proven role in reducing risk of infec-
tion for phagocyte defects.

Although aggressive medical care for many patients with phagocytic 
disorders  can  allow  them  to  go  for  years  without  a  life-threatening 
infection,  there  may  still  be  delayed  effects  of  prolonged  antimicro-
bials and other inflammatory complications. Cure of most congenital 
phagocyte  defects  is  possible  by  bone  marrow  transplantation,  and 
rates of success are improving (Chap. 114). The identification of spe-
cific gene defects in patients with LAD 1, CGD, and other immunode-
ficiencies has led to gene therapy trials in a number of genetic white 
cell disorders.

65 Bleeding and Thrombosis

Barbara A. Konkle

The human hemostatic system provides a natural balance between pro-
coagulant  and  anticoagulant  forces.  The  procoagulant  forces  include 
platelet adhesion and aggregation and fibrin clot formation; anticoag-
ulant forces include the natural inhibitors of coagulation and fibrinoly-
sis. Under normal circumstances, hemostasis is regulated to promote 
blood flow; however, it is also prepared to clot blood rapidly to arrest 
blood flow and prevent exsanguination. After bleeding is successfully 
halted,  the  system  remodels  the  damaged  vessel  to  restore  normal 
blood  flow.  The  major  components  of  the  hemostatic  system,  which 
function  in  concert,  are  (1)  platelets  and  other  formed  elements  of 
blood, such as monocytes and red cells; (2) plasma proteins (the coag-
ulation and fibrinolytic factors and inhibitors); and (3) the vessel wall.

STEPS OF NORMAL HEMOSTASIS
 ■ PLATELET PLUG FORMATION
On  vascular  injury,  platelets  adhere  to  the  site  of  injury,  usually  the 
denuded  vascular  intimal  surface.  Platelet  adhesion  is  mediated  pri-
marily  by  von  Willebrand  factor  (VWF),  a  large  multimeric  protein 
present in both plasma and the extracellular matrix of the subendothe-
lial vessel wall, which serves as the primary “molecular glue,” providing 
sufficient  strength  to  withstand  the  high  levels  of  shear  stress  that 
would tend to detach them with the flow of blood. Platelet adhesion 
is also facilitated by direct binding to subendothelial collagen through 
specific platelet membrane collagen receptors.

Platelet adhesion results in subsequent platelet activation and aggre-
gation. This process is enhanced and amplified by humoral mediators 
in plasma (e.g., epinephrine, thrombin); mediators released from acti-
vated platelets (e.g., adenosine diphosphate, serotonin); and vessel wall 
extracellular  matrix  constituents  that  come  in  contact  with  adherent 
platelets (e.g., collagen, VWF). Activated platelets undergo the release 
reaction,  during  which  they  secrete  contents  that  further  promote 
aggregation  and  inhibit  the  naturally  anticoagulant  endothelial  cell 
factors. During platelet aggregation (platelet-platelet interaction), addi-
tional platelets are recruited from the circulation to the site of vascular 
injury, leading to the formation of an occlusive platelet thrombus. The 
platelet plug is anchored and stabilized by the developing fibrin mesh.
The platelet glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3) complex is the most 
abundant receptor on the platelet surface. Platelet activation converts 
the  normally  inactive  Gp  IIb/IIIa  receptor  into  an  active  receptor, 
enabling binding to fibrinogen and VWF. Because the surface of each 
platelet has about 50,000 Gp IIb/IIIa–binding sites, numerous activated

occlusive aggregate by means of a dense network of intercellular fibrin-
ogen bridges.

 ■ FIBRIN CLOT FORMATION
Plasma  coagulation  proteins  (clotting  factors)  normally  circulate  in 
plasma  in  their  inactive  forms.  The  sequence  of  coagulation  protein 
reactions  that  culminate  in  the  formation  of  fibrin  was  originally 
described  as  a  waterfall  or  a  cascade.  Two  pathways  of  blood  coag-
ulation  have  been  described  in  the  past:  the  so-called  extrinsic,  or 
tissue factor, pathway and the so-called intrinsic, or contact activation, 
pathway. We now know that coagulation is normally initiated through 
tissue factor (TF) exposure and activation through the classic extrinsic 
pathway but with critically important amplification through elements 
of  the  classic  intrinsic  pathway,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  65-1.  These 
reactions  take  place  on  phospholipid  surfaces,  usually  the  activated 
platelet surface. Coagulation testing in the laboratory can reflect other 
influences due to the artificial nature of the in vitro systems used (see 
below).

The  immediate  trigger  for  coagulation  is  vascular  damage  that 
exposes  blood  to  TF  that  is  constitutively  expressed  on  the  surfaces 
of  subendothelial  cellular  components  of  the  vessel  wall,  such  as 
smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. TF is also present in circulating 
microparticles, presumably shed from cells including monocytes and 
platelets. TF binds the serine protease factor VIIa; the complex acti-
vates factor X to factor Xa. Alternatively, the complex can indirectly 
activate factor X by initially converting factor IX to factor IXa, which 
then activates factor X. The participation of factor XI in hemostasis 
is  not  dependent  on  its  activation  by  factor  XIIa  but  rather  on  its 
positive feedback activation by thrombin. Thus, factor XIa functions 
in the propagation and amplification, rather than in the initiation, of 
the coagulation cascade. The role of factor XIIa in activation of factor 
XI is not fully elucidated, but studies suggest it may be a mechanism 
to promote thrombosis.

Factor  Xa  can  be  formed  through  the  actions  of  either  the  TF/
factor  VIIa  complex  or  factor  IXa  (with  factor  VIIIa  as  a  cofactor) 
and  converts  prothrombin  to  thrombin,  the  pivotal  protease  of  the 
coagulation system. The essential cofactor for this reaction is factor Va. 
Like the homologous factor VIIIa, factor Va is produced by thrombin- 
induced limited proteolysis of factor V. Thrombin is a multifunctional 
enzyme that converts soluble plasma fibrinogen to an insoluble fibrin

lecular  associations  (Fig.  65-2).  Thrombin  also  activates  factor  XIII 
(fibrin-stabilizing factor) to factor XIIIa, which covalently cross-links 
and thereby stabilizes the fibrin clot.

The assembly of the clotting factors on activated cell membrane sur-
faces greatly accelerates their reaction rates and also serves to localize 
blood  clotting  to  sites  of  vascular  injury.  The  critical  cell  membrane 
components, acidic phospholipids, are not normally exposed on rest-
ing cell membrane surfaces. However, when platelets, monocytes, and 
endothelial cells are activated by vascular injury or inflammatory stim-
uli,  the  procoagulant  head  groups  of  the 
membrane anionic phospholipids become 
translocated  to  the  surfaces  of  these  cells 
or released as part of microparticles, mak-
ing them available to support and promote 
the plasma coagulation reactions.

ANTITHROMBOTIC 
MECHANISMS
Several physiologic antithrombotic mech-
anisms  act  in  concert  to  prevent  clot-
ting  under  normal  circumstances.  These 
mechanisms  operate  to  preserve  blood 
fluidity and to limit blood clotting to spe-
cific  focal  sites  of  vascular  injury.  Endo-
thelial  cells  have  many  antithrombotic 
effects.  They  produce  prostacyclin,  nitric 
oxide,  and  ectoADPase/CD39,  which  act 
to  inhibit  platelet  binding,  secretion,  and 
aggregation.  Endothelial  cells  produce 
anticoagulant  factors  including  hepa-
ran  proteoglycans,  TF  pathway  inhibitor, 
and  thrombomodulin.  They  also  activate 
fibrinolytic mechanisms through the pro-
duction  of  tissue  plasminogen  activator, 
urokinase,  plasminogen  activator  inhibi-
tors, and annexin-2.

complex is formed, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits the TF/FVIIa pathway, making coagulation dependent 
on the amplification loop through FIX/FVIII. Coagulation requires calcium (not shown) and takes place on phospholipid 
surfaces, usually the activated platelet membrane.

Antithrombin  is  the  major  plasma  protease  inhibitor  of  thrombin 
and the other clotting factors in coagulation. Antithrombin neutralizes 
thrombin and other activated coagulation factors by forming a com-
plex between the active site of the enzyme and the reactive center of 
antithrombin.  The  rate  of  formation  of  these  inactivating  complexes 
increases  by  a  factor  of  several  thousand  in  the  presence  of  heparin. 
Antithrombin  inactivation  of  thrombin  and  other  activated  clotting 
factors occurs physiologically on vascular surfaces, where glycosamino-
glycans, including heparan sulfates, are present to catalyze these reac-
tions. Inherited quantitative or qualitative deficiencies of antithrombin 
lead to a lifelong predisposition to venous thromboembolism.

Protein  C  is  a  plasma  glycoprotein  that  becomes  an  anticoagulant 
when it is activated by thrombin. The thrombin-induced activation of 
protein  C  occurs  physiologically  on  thrombomodulin,  a  transmem-
brane proteoglycan-binding site for thrombin on endothelial cell sur-
faces. The binding of protein C to its receptor on endothelial cells places 
it  in  proximity  to  the  thrombin-thrombomodulin  complex,  thereby 
enhancing its activation efficiency. (See Fig. 65-3.) Activated protein C 
acts as an anticoagulant by cleaving and inactivating activated factors 
V and VIII. This reaction is accelerated by a cofactor, protein S, which, 
like protein C, is a glycoprotein that undergoes vitamin K–dependent 
posttranslational modification. Quantitative or qualitative deficiencies 
of protein C or protein S, or resistance to the action of activated protein 
C by a specific variant at its target cleavage site in factor Va (factor V 
Leiden), lead to hypercoagulable states.

Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a plasma protease inhibitor 
that regulates the TF-induced extrinsic pathway of coagulation. TFPI 
inhibits  the  TF/factor  VIIa/factor  Xa  complex,  essentially  turning 
off  the  TF/factor  VIIa  initiation  of  coagulation,  which  then  becomes 
dependent  on  the  “amplification  loop”  via  factor  XI  and  factor  VIII 
activation by thrombin. TFPI is bound to lipoprotein and can also be 
released  by  heparin  from  endothelial  cells,  where  it  is  bound  to  gly-
cosaminoglycans, and from platelets. The heparin-mediated release of 
TFPI may play a role in the anticoagulant effects of unfractionated and 
low-molecular-weight heparins.

 ■ THE FIBRINOLYTIC SYSTEM
Any  thrombin  that  escapes  the  inhibitory  effects  of  the  physiologic 
anticoagulant  systems  is  available  to  convert  fibrinogen  to  fibrin. 
In  response,  the  endogenous  fibrinolytic  system  is  then  activated  to 

FIGURE 65-4  A schematic diagram of the fibrinolytic system. Tissue plasminogen 
activator (tPA) is released from endothelial cells, binds the fibrin clot, and activates 
plasminogen  to  plasmin.  Release  of  plasminogen  activator  inhibitors  (PAI-1  and 
PAI-2)  inhibits  tPA  and  urokinase  (uPA).  Excess  fibrin  is  degraded  by  plasmin  to 
distinct  degradation  products  [FDPs  (d-dimers)].  Any  free  plasmin  is  complexed 
with α2-antiplasmin (α2Pl). PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; uPA, urokinase-type

dispose of intravascular fibrin and thereby maintain or reestablish the 
patency of the circulation. Just as thrombin is the key protease enzyme 
of  the  coagulation  system,  plasmin  is  the  major  protease  enzyme  of 
the  fibrinolytic  system,  acting  to  digest  fibrin  to  fibrin  degradation 
products. The general scheme of fibrinolysis and its control is shown 
in Fig. 65-4.

The  plasminogen  activators,  tissue  type  plasminogen  activator 
(tPA) and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), cleave the 
Arg560-Val561  bond  of  plasminogen  to  generate  the  active  enzyme 
plasmin. The lysine-binding sites of plasmin (and plasminogen) permit 
it to bind to fibrin, so that physiologic fibrinolysis is “fibrin specific.” 
Both  plasminogen  (through  its  lysine-binding  sites)  and  tPA  possess 
specific  affinity  for  fibrin  and  thereby  bind  selectively  to  clots.  The 
assembly of a ternary complex, consisting of fibrin, plasminogen, and 
tPA, promotes the localized interaction between plasminogen and tPA 
and greatly accelerates the rate of plasminogen activation to plasmin. 
Moreover, partial degradation of fibrin by plasmin exposes new plas-
minogen  and  tPA-binding  sites  in  carboxy-terminus  lysine  residues 
of fibrin fragments to enhance these reactions further. This creates a 
highly  efficient  mechanism  to  generate  plasmin  focally  on  the  fibrin 
clot,  which  then  becomes  plasmin’s  substrate  for  digestion  to  fibrin 
degradation products.

Plasmin cleaves fibrin at distinct sites of the fibrin molecule, leading 
to  the  generation  of  characteristic  fibrin  fragments  during  the  pro-
cess of fibrinolysis (Fig. 65-2). The sites of plasmin cleavage of fibrin 
are the same as those in fibrinogen. However, when plasmin acts on 
covalently cross-linked fibrin, d-dimers are released; hence, d-dimers 
can be measured in plasma as a relatively specific test of fibrin (rather 
than fibrinogen) degradation. d-Dimer assays can be used as sensitive 
markers of blood clot formation and have been validated for clinical 
use  to  exclude  the  diagnosis  of  deep  venous  thrombosis  (DVT)  and 
pulmonary embolism in selected populations. d-Dimer levels increase 
with age. A higher cut-off value to rule out venous thromboembolism 
(VTE) in the elderly has been proposed but is controversial.

Physiologic  regulation  of  fibrinolysis  occurs  primarily  at  three 
levels:  (1)  plasminogen  activator  inhibitors  (PAIs),  specifically  PAI-1 
and  PAI-2,  inhibit  the  physiologic  plasminogen  activators;  (2)  the 
thrombin-activatable  fibrinolysis  inhibitor  (TAFI)  limits  fibrinolysis; 
and (3) α2-antiplasmin inhibits plasmin. PAI-1 is the primary inhibitor 
of tPA and uPA in plasma. TAFI cleaves the N-terminal lysine residues 
of fibrin, which aid in localization of plasmin activity. α2-Antiplasmin 
is  the  main  inhibitor  of  plasmin  in  human  plasma,  inactivating  any 
nonfibrin clot–associated plasmin.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesAPPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Bleeding and Thrombosis 

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Disorders  of  hemostasis  may  be  either  inherited  or  acquired.  A 
detailed  personal  and  family  history  is  key  in  determining  the 
chronicity  of  symptoms  and  the  likelihood  of  the  disorder  being 
inherited, as well as providing clues to underlying conditions that 
have contributed to the bleeding or thrombotic state. In addition, 
the  history  can  give  clues  as  to  the  etiology  by  determining  (1) 
the  bleeding  (mucosal  and/or  joint)  or  thrombosis  (arterial  and/
or venous) site and (2) whether an underlying bleeding or clotting 
tendency was enhanced by another medical condition or the intro-
duction of medications or dietary supplements. 
History of Bleeding  A history of bleeding is the most important 
predictor  of  bleeding  risk.  In  evaluating  a  patient  for  a  bleeding 
disorder,  a  history  of  at-risk  situations,  including  the  response  to 
past surgeries, should be assessed. Does the patient have a history 
of spontaneous or trauma/surgery-induced bleeding? Spontaneous 
hemarthroses are a hallmark of moderate and severe factor VIII and 
IX  deficiency  and,  in  rare  circumstances,  of  other  clotting  factor 
deficiencies.  Mucosal  bleeding  symptoms  are  more  suggestive  of 
underlying  platelet  disorders  or  von  Willebrand  disease  (VWD), 
termed  disorders  of  primary  hemostasis  or  platelet  plug  formation. 
Disorders affecting primary hemostasis are shown in Table 65-1.

A bleeding score has been validated as a tool to predict patients 
more likely to have type 1 VWD (International Society on Throm-
bosis  and  Haemostasis  Bleeding  Assessment  Tool  [www.isth 
.org/resource/resmgr/ssc/isth-ssc_bleeding_assessment.pdf]),  and  a 
self-administered form has been validated. This is the most useful 
tool in excluding the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, thus avoiding 
unnecessary  testing,  and  is  recommended  by  2021  guidelines  for 
screening  for  VWD  in  primary  care.  Bleeding  symptoms  that  are 
more  common  in  patients  with  bleeding  disorders  include  pro-
longed  bleeding  with  surgery,  dental  procedures  and  extractions, 
and/or  trauma;  heavy  menstrual  bleeding  or  postpartum  hemor-
rhage; and large bruises (often described with lumps).

Easy bruising and heavy menstrual bleeding are common com-
plaints in patients with and without bleeding disorders. Easy bruis-
ing can also be a sign of medical conditions in which there is no

identifiable coagulopathy; instead, the conditions are caused by an 
abnormality of blood vessels or their supporting connective tissues. 
In  Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome,  there  may  be  posttraumatic  bleed-
ing  and  a  history  of  joint  hyperextensibility.  Cushing’s  syndrome, 
chronic  steroid  use,  and  aging  result  in  changes  in  skin  and  sub-
cutaneous tissue, and subcutaneous bleeding occurs in response to 
minor trauma. The latter has been termed senile purpura.

Epistaxis is a common symptom, particularly in children and in 
dry climates, and may not reflect an underlying bleeding disorder. 
However,  it  is  the  most  common  symptom  in  hereditary  hemor-
rhagic  telangiectasia  and  in  boys  with  VWD.  Clues  that  epistaxis 
is  a  symptom  of  an  underlying  bleeding  disorder  include  lack  of 
seasonal  variation  and  bleeding  that  requires  medical  evaluation 
or  treatment,  including  cauterization.  Bleeding  with  eruption  of 
primary teeth is seen in children with more severe bleeding disor-
ders, such as moderate and severe hemophilia. It is uncommon in 
children  with  mild  bleeding  disorders.  Patients  with  disorders  of 
primary hemostasis (platelet adhesion) may have increased bleed-
ing  after  dental  cleanings  and  other  procedures  that  involve  gum 
manipulation.

Heavy  menstrual  bleeding  is  defined  quantitatively  as  a  loss  of   
>80  mL  of  blood  per  cycle,  based  on  the  quantity  of  blood  loss 
required to produce iron-deficiency anemia. A complaint of heavy 
menses  is  subjective  and  has  a  poor  correlation  with  excessive 
blood loss. Predictors of heavy menstrual bleeding include bleeding 
resulting in iron-deficiency anemia or a need for blood transfusion, 
passage of clots >1 inch in diameter, and changing a pad or tampon 
more than hourly. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common symp-
tom in women with underlying bleeding disorders and is reported 
in the majority of women with VWD, factor XI deficiency, platelet 
function disorders, and hemophilia, including genetic carriers with 
borderline-normal factor levels. Women with underlying bleeding 
disorders are more likely to have other bleeding symptoms, includ-
ing bleeding after dental extractions and postoperative and postpar-
tum bleeding, and are much more likely to have heavy menstrual 
bleeding beginning at menarche than women with heavy menstrual 
bleeding due to other causes. Heavy menstrual bleeding may results 
in  iron  deficiency  and  is  documented  to  have  significant  adverse 
effects on quality of life.

Postpartum hemorrhage is a common symptom in women with 
underlying  bleeding  disorders.  In  women  with  type  1  VWD  or 
hemophilia A in whom levels of VWF and factor VIII usually nor-
malize during pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage may be delayed. 
Women  with  a  history  of  postpartum  hemorrhage  may  have  a 
higher  risk  of  recurrence  with  subsequent  pregnancies.  Women 
with underlying bleeding disorders are at risk for other reproduc-
tive tract bleeding, including rupture of ovarian cysts with intraab-
dominal hemorrhage.

Tonsillectomy  is  a  major  hemostatic  challenge,  because  intact 
hemostatic mechanisms are essential to prevent excessive bleeding 
from  the  tonsillar  bed.  Bleeding  may  occur  early  after  surgery  or 
after approximately 7 days postoperatively, with loss of the eschar 
at the operative site. Similar delayed bleeding is seen after colonic 
polyp resection. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and hematuria are 
usually  due  to  underlying  pathology,  and  procedures  to  identify 
and treat the bleeding site should be undertaken, even in patients 
with known bleeding disorders. VWD, particularly types 2 and 3, is 
associated with angiodysplasia of the bowel and GI bleeding.

Hemarthroses  and  spontaneous  muscle  hematomas  are  char-
acteristic of moderate or severe congenital factor VIII or IX defi-
ciency. They can also be seen in moderate and severe deficiencies 
of fibrinogen, prothrombin, and factors V, VII, and X. Spontaneous 
hemarthroses  occur  rarely  in  other  bleeding  disorders  except  for 
severe  VWD,  with  associated  factor  VIII  levels  <5%.  Muscle  and 
soft  tissue  bleeds  are  also  common  in  acquired  factor  VIII  defi-
ciency. Bleeding into a joint results in severe pain and swelling, as 
well as loss of function, but is rarely associated with discoloration 
from  bruising  around  the  joint.  Life-threatening  sites  of  bleeding

include bleeding into the oropharynx, where bleeding can obstruct 
the airway, into the central nervous system, and into the retroperi-
toneum.  Central  nervous  system  bleeding  is  the  major  cause  of 
bleeding-related  deaths  in  patients  with  severe  congenital  factor 
deficiencies. 
Prohemorrhagic Effects of Medications and Dietary Supplements   
Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
that inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 impair primary hemostasis and may 
exacerbate  bleeding  from  another  cause  or  even  unmask  a  previ-
ously  occult  mild  bleeding  disorder  such  as  VWD.  All  NSAIDs, 
however, can precipitate GI bleeding, which may be more severe in 
patients with underlying bleeding disorders. The aspirin effect on 
platelet function lasts for the life of the platelet; however, in indi-
viduals with typical platelet turnover, the functional defect reverts 
to  near-normal  within  2–3  days  after  the  last  dose.  The  effect  of 
other NSAIDs is shorter, as the inhibitor effect is reversed when the 
drug is removed. Inhibitors of the ADP P2Y12 receptor (clopidogrel, 
prasugrel,  and  ticagrelor)  inhibit  ADP-mediated  platelet  aggre-
gation  and,  like  NSAIDs,  can  precipitate  or  exacerbate  bleeding 
symptoms. The risk of bleeding with these drugs is higher than with  
NSAIDs.

Many  herbal  supplements  can  impair  hemostatic  function   

(Table 65-2). Some are more convincingly associated with a bleed-
ing  risk  than  others.  Fish  oil  or  concentrated  omega-3  fatty  acid 
supplements impair platelet function. They alter platelet biochem-
istry to produce more PGI3, a more potent platelet inhibitor than 
prostacyclin  (PGI2),  and  more  thromboxane  A3,  a  less  potent 
platelet activator than thromboxane A2. In fact, diets naturally rich 
in omega-3 fatty acids can result in a prolonged bleeding time and 
abnormal  platelet  aggregation  studies,  but  the  actual  associated 
bleeding risk is unclear. Vitamin E appears to inhibit protein kinase 
C–mediated  platelet  aggregation  and  nitric  oxide  production.  In 
patients  with  unexplained  bruising  or  bleeding,  it  is  prudent  to 
review any new medications or supplements and discontinue those 
that may be associated with bleeding. 
Underlying  Systemic  Diseases  That  Cause  or  Exacerbate  a   
Bleeding  Tendency  Acquired  bleeding  disorders  are  commonly 
secondary  to,  or  associated  with,  systemic  disease.  The  clinical 
evaluation  of  a  patient  with  a  bleeding  tendency  must  therefore 
include a thorough assessment for evidence of underlying disease. 
Bruising or mucosal bleeding may be the presenting complaint in 

liver  disease,  severe  renal  impairment,  hypothyroidism,  parapro-
teinemias  or  amyloidosis,  and  conditions  causing  bone  marrow 
failure.  All  coagulation  factors  are  synthesized  in  the  liver,  and 
hepatic failure results in combined factor deficiencies. This is often 
compounded by thrombocytopenia and portal hypertension. Coag-
ulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and proteins C, S, and Z are depen-
dent  on  vitamin  K  for  posttranslational  modification.  Although 
vitamin K is required in both procoagulant and anticoagulant pro-
cesses, the phenotype of vitamin K deficiency or the warfarin effect 
on coagulation is bleeding.

The normal blood platelet count is 150,000–450,000/μL. Throm-
bocytopenia results from decreased production, increased destruc-
tion,  and/or  sequestration.  Although  the  bleeding  risk  varies 
somewhat by the reason for the thrombocytopenia, bleeding rarely 
occurs  in  isolated  thrombocytopenia  at  counts  >50,000/μL  and 
usually  not  until  <10,000–20,000/μL.  Coexisting  coagulopathies, 
as  is  seen  in  liver  failure  or  disseminated  coagulation;  infection; 
platelet-inhibitory  drugs;  and  underlying  medical  conditions  can 
all  increase  the  risk  of  bleeding  in  the  thrombocytopenic  patient. 
Most procedures can be performed in patients with a platelet count 
of 50,000/μL or greater. 

HISTORY OF THROMBOSIS
The risk of thrombosis, like that of bleeding, is influenced by both 
genetic and environmental factors. The major risk factor for arterial 
thrombosis is atherosclerosis, whereas for venous thrombosis, the 
risk  factors  are  immobility,  surgery,  underlying  medical  condi-
tions  such  as  malignancy,  medications  such  as  hormonal  therapy, 
obesity, and genetic predispositions. Factors that increase risks for 
venous and for both venous and arterial thromboses are shown in  
Table 65-3.

The most important point in a history related to venous throm-
bosis is determining whether the thrombotic event was idiopathic 
(meaning there was no clear precipitating factor) or was a precipi-
tated event. In patients without underlying malignancy, having an 
idiopathic  event  is  the  strongest  predictor  of  recurrence  of  VTE. 
In  patients  who  have  a  vague  history  of  thrombosis,  a  history  of 
being treated with warfarin or other anticoagulants suggests a past 
DVT. Age is an important risk factor for venous thrombosis—the 
risk of DVT increases per decade, with an approximate incidence 
of 1/100,000 per year in early childhood to 1/200 per year among 
octogenarians. Family history is helpful in determining if there is a

FIGURE  65-5  Thrombotic  risk  over  time.  Shown  schematically  is  an  individual’s 
thrombotic  risk  over  time.  An  underlying  factor  V  Leiden  variant  provides  a 
“theoretically” constant increased risk. The thrombotic risk increases with age and, 
intermittently, with oral contraceptive (OCP) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) 
use; other events, like major surgery or illness, will increase the risk further. At some 
point, the cumulative risk may increase to the threshold for thrombosis and result in 
deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Note: The magnitude and duration of risk portrayed 
in the figure are meant for example only and may not precisely reflect the relative 
risk determined by clinical study. (Sources: From BA Konkle, A Schafer, in DP Zipes 
et al [eds]: Braunwald’s Heart Disease, 7th ed. Philadelphia, Saunders, 2005; from 
FR Rosendaal: Venous thrombosis: A multicausal disease. Lancet 353:1167, 1999.)

genetic predisposition and how strong that predisposition appears 
to  be.  A  genetic  thrombophilia  that  confers  a  relatively  small 
increased  risk,  such  as  being  a  heterozygote  for  the  prothrombin 
G20210A  or  factor  V  Leiden  mutation,  is  a  minor  determinant 
of  risk  in  an  elderly  individual  undergoing  a  high-risk  surgical 
procedure.  As  illustrated  in  Fig. 65-5,  a  thrombotic  event  usually 
has  more  than  one  contributing  factor.  Predisposing  factors  must 
be carefully assessed to determine the risk of recurrent thrombosis 
and, with consideration of the patient’s bleeding risk, determine the 
length of anticoagulation. Testing for inherited thrombophilias in 
adults  should  be  limited  to  instances  where  results  would  change 
clinical care. Such instances are rare. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION
Careful history taking and clinical examination are essential com-
ponents in the assessment of bleeding and thrombotic risk. The use 
of laboratory tests of coagulation complements, but cannot substi-
tute  for,  clinical  assessment.  No  test  exists  that  provides  a  global 
assessment of hemostasis. The bleeding time has been used to assess 
bleeding risk; however, it does not predict bleeding risk with sur-
gery, and it is not recommended for this indication. The PFA-100, 
an instrument that measures platelet-dependent coagulation under 
flow conditions, is more sensitive and specific for VWD than the 
bleeding time; however, it is not sensitive enough to rule out mild 
bleeding disorders. PFA-100 closure times are prolonged in patients 
with some, but not all, inherited platelet disorders. Also, its utility 
in predicting bleeding risk has not been determined. Thromboelas-
tography can be useful in guiding intraoperative transfusion and is 
being explored in other settings, but is not broadly applicable for the 
diagnosis of disorders of hemostasis and thrombosis.

For routine preoperative and preprocedure testing, an abnormal 
prothrombin time (PT) may detect liver disease or vitamin K defi-
ciency that had not been previously appreciated. Studies have not 
confirmed  the  usefulness  of  an  activated  partial  thromboplastin 
time (aPTT) in preoperative evaluations in patients with a negative

bleeding history. The primary use of coagulation testing should be 
to confirm the presence and type of bleeding disorder in a patient 
with a suspicious clinical history.

Because  of  the  nature  of  coagulation  assays,  proper  sample 
acquisition  and  handling  is  critical  to  obtaining  valid  results.  In 
patients  with  abnormal  coagulation  assays  who  have  no  bleeding 
history,  repeat  studies  with  attention  to  these  factors  frequently 
results  in  normal  values.  Most  coagulation  assays  are  performed 
in  sodium  citrate  anticoagulated  plasma  that  is  recalcified  for  the 
assay. Because the anticoagulant is in liquid solution and needs to 
be added to blood in proportion to the plasma volume, incorrectly 
filled or inadequately mixed blood collection tubes will give errone-
ous results. These vacutainer tubes should be filled to >90% of the 
recommended fill, which is usually denoted by a line on the tube. 
An elevated hematocrit (>55%) can result in a false value due to a 
decreased plasma-to-anticoagulant ratio. 
Screening  Assays  The  most  commonly  used  screening  tests 
are the PT, aPTT, and platelet count. The PT assesses the factors I 
(fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V, VII, and X (Fig. 65-6). The PT 
measures  the  time  for  clot  formation  of  the  citrated  plasma  after 
recalcification  and  addition  of  thromboplastin,  a  mixture  of  TF 
and phospholipids. The sensitivity of the assay varies by the source 
of thromboplastin. The relationship between defects in secondary 
hemostasis  (fibrin  formation)  and  coagulation  test  abnormalities 
is  shown  in  Table  65-4.  To  adjust  for  this  variability,  the  overall 
sensitivity of different thromboplastins to reduction of the vitamin 
K–dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in anticoagulation 
patients is expressed as the International Sensitivity Index (ISI). The 
international  normalized  ratio  (INR)  is  determined  based  on  the 
formula: INR = (PTpatient/PTnormal mean)ISI.

The  INR  was  developed  to  assess  stable  anticoagulation  due 
to  reduction  of  vitamin  K–dependent  coagulation  factors;  it  is 
commonly  used  in  the  evaluation  of  patients  with  liver  disease. 
Although  it  does  allow  comparison  between  laboratories,  reagent 
sensitivity as used to determine the ISI is not the same in liver dis-
ease as with warfarin anticoagulation. In addition, progressive liver 
failure  is  associated  with  variable  changes  in  coagulation  factors; 
the degree of prolongation of either the PT or the INR only roughly

predicts  the  bleeding  risk.  Thrombin  generation  has  been  shown 
to  be  normal  in  many  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  liver  dys-
function. Because the PT only measures one aspect of hemostasis 
affected  by  liver  dysfunction,  we  likely  overestimate  the  bleeding 
risk of a mildly elevated INR in this setting. PT reagents have vari-
able  sensitivity  to  the  direct  Xa  inhibitors,  and  the  PT  is  usually 
normal in patients on apixaban.

The aPTT assesses the intrinsic and common coagulation path-
ways;  factors  XI,  IX,  VIII,  X,  V,  and  II;  fibrinogen;  prekallikrein; 
high-molecular-weight  kininogen;  and  factor  XII  (Fig.  65-6).  The 
aPTT reagent contains phospholipids derived from either animal or 
vegetable sources that function as a platelet substitute in the coag-
ulation pathways and includes an activator of the intrinsic coagu-
lation system, such as nonparticulate ellagic acid or the particulate 
activators kaolin, celite, or micronized silica.

The  phospholipid  composition  of  aPTT  reagents  varies,  which 
influences  the  sensitivity  of  individual  reagents  to  clotting  factor 
deficiencies and to inhibitors such as heparin and lupus anticoagu-
lants. Thus, aPTT results will vary from one laboratory to another, 
and  the  normal  range  in  the  laboratory  where  the  testing  occurs 
should be used in the interpretation. Local laboratories can relate 
their  aPTT  values  to  the  therapeutic  heparin  anticoagulation  by 
correlating  aPTT  values  with  direct  measurements  of  heparin 
activity  (anti-Xa  or  protamine  titration  assays)  in  samples  from 
heparinized patients, although correlation between these assays is 

often poor. The aPTT reagent will vary in sensitivity to individual 
factor deficiencies and usually becomes prolonged with individual 
factor deficiencies of 30–50%. 
Mixing Studies  Mixing studies are used to evaluate a prolonged 
aPTT or, less commonly PT, to distinguish between a factor defi-
ciency  and  an  inhibitor.  In  this  assay,  normal  plasma  and  patient 
plasma are mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and the aPTT or PT is determined 
immediately and after incubation at 37°C for varying times, typi-
cally 30, 60, and/or 120 min. With isolated factor deficiencies, the 
aPTT will correct with mixing and stay corrected with incubation. 
With aPTT prolongation due to a lupus anticoagulant, the mixing 
and  incubation  will  show  no  correction.  In  acquired  neutralizing 
factor antibodies, notably an acquired factor VIII inhibitor, the ini-
tial assay may or may not correct immediately after mixing but will 
prolong  or  remain  prolonged  with  incubation  at  37°C.  Failure  to 
correct with mixing can also be due to the presence of other inhibi-
tors or interfering substances such as heparin, fibrin split products, 
and paraproteins. 
Specific  Factor  Assays  Decisions  to  proceed  with  specific  clot-
ting  factor  assays  will  be  influenced  by  the  clinical  situation  and 
the  results  of  coagulation  screening  tests.  Precise  diagnosis  and 
effective management of inherited and acquired coagulation defi-
ciencies  necessitate  quantitation  of  the  relevant  factors.  When 
bleeding  is  severe,  specific  assays  are  urgently  required  to  guide 
appropriate therapy. Individual factor assays are usually performed 
as modifications of the mixing study, where the patient’s plasma is 
mixed with plasma deficient in the factor being studied. This will 
correct all factor deficiencies to >50%, thus making prolongation of 
clot formation due to a factor deficiency dependent on the factor 
missing from the added plasma. 
Testing  for  Antiphospholipid  Antibodies  Antibodies  to  phospholip-
ids  (cardiolipin)  or  phospholipid-binding  proteins  (β2-microglobulin 
and  others)  are  detected  by  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay 
(ELISA).  When  these  antibodies  interfere  with  phospholipid- 
dependent  coagulation  tests,  they  are  termed  lupus  anticoagu-
lants. The aPTT has variability sensitivity to lupus anticoagulants, 
depending in part on the aPTT reagents used. An assay using a sen-
sitive reagent has been termed an LA-PTT. The dilute Russell viper 
venom test (dRVVT) is a modification of a standard test with the 
phospholipid  reagent  decreased,  thus  increasing  the  sensitivity  to 
antibodies that interfere with the phospholipid component. These 
tests,  however,  are  not  specific  for  lupus  anticoagulants,  because 
factor deficiencies or other inhibitors will also result in prolonga-
tion.  Documentation  of  a  lupus  anticoagulant  requires  not  only 
prolongation of a phospholipid-dependent coagulation test but also 
lack of correction when mixed with normal plasma and correction 
with the addition of activated platelet membranes or certain phos-
pholipids (e.g., hexagonal phase). 
Other  Coagulation  Tests  The  thrombin  time  and  the  reptilase 
time  measure  fibrinogen  conversion  to  fibrin  and  are  prolonged 
when the fibrinogen level is low (usually <80–100 mg/dL) or qual-
itatively abnormal, as seen in inherited or acquired dysfibrinogen-
emias,  or  when  fibrin/fibrinogen  degradation  products  interfere. 
The thrombin time, but not the reptilase time, is prolonged in the 
presence of heparin. The thrombin time is markedly prolonged in 
the presence of the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran; a dilute 
thrombin time can be used to assess drug activity. Measurement of 
anti–factor  Xa  plasma  inhibitory  activity  is  a  test  frequently  used 
to assess low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) levels, as a direct 
measurement of unfractionated heparin (UFH) activity, or to assess 
activity of the direct Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edox-
aban. Drug in the patient sample inhibits the enzymatic conversion 
of an Xa-specific chromogenic substrate to colored product by fac-
tor Xa. Standard curves are created using multiple concentrations 
of the specific drug and are used to calculate the concentration of 
anti-Xa activity in the patient plasma.

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of DiseasesLaboratory Testing for Thrombophilia  Laboratory assays to detect 
thrombophilic  states  include  molecular  diagnostics  and  immuno-
logic  and  functional  assays.  These  assays  vary  in  their  sensitivity 
and  specificity  for  the  condition  being  tested.  Furthermore,  acute 
thrombosis,  acute  illnesses,  inflammatory  conditions,  pregnancy, 
and medications affect levels of many coagulation factors and their 
inhibitors. Antithrombin is decreased by heparin and in the setting 
of acute thrombosis. Protein C and S levels may be increased in the 
setting  of  acute  thrombosis  and  are  decreased  by  warfarin.  Anti-
phospholipid antibodies are frequently transiently positive in acute 
illness. Testing for genetic thrombophilias should, in general, only 
be performed when there is a strong family history of thrombosis 
and results would affect clinical decision-making.

Because  thrombophilia  evaluations  are  usually  performed  to 
assess  the  need  to  extend  anticoagulation,  testing,  if  indicated, 
should be performed in a steady state, remote from the acute event. 
Functional assays, but not genetic assays, will be affected by anti-
coagulants including warfarin (for vitamin K–dependent proteins) 
and  thrombin  and  Xa  inhibitors  and  cannot  be  interpreted  in 
patients  on  those  drugs.  In  most  instances,  when  discontinuation 
of anticoagulation is being considered, drugs can be stopped after 
the initial 3–6 months of treatment, and testing can be performed 
at least 3 weeks later. 
Measures  of  Platelet  Function  The  bleeding  time  was  used  in 
the past to assess bleeding risk; however, it has not been found to 
predict bleeding risk with surgery, and it is not recommended for 
use for this indication. The PFA-100 and similar instruments that 
measure  platelet-dependent  coagulation  under  flow  conditions 
are  generally  more  sensitive  and  specific  for  platelet  disorders 
and  VWD  than  the  bleeding  time;  however,  data  are  insufficient 
to  support  their  use  to  predict  bleeding  risk  or  monitor  response 
to therapy, and they will be normal in some patients with platelet 
disorders or mild VWD. When they are used in the evaluation of a 
patient with bleeding symptoms, abnormal results require specific 
testing,  such  as  VWF  assays  and/or  platelet  aggregation  studies. 
Because all of these “screening” assays may miss patients with mild 
bleeding disorders, further studies are needed to define their role in 
hemostasis testing.

For  classic  platelet  aggregometry,  various  agonists  are  added 
to  the  patient’s  platelet-rich  plasma  or  whole  blood,  and  platelet 
aggregation is measured. Tests of platelet secretion in response to 
agonists can also be measured. These remain the gold standard for 
diagnosis of platelet function disorders. However, they are affected 
by many factors, including numerous medications, and the associa-
tion between minor defects in these assays and bleeding risk is not 
clearly established.

66 Enlargement of Lymph  
Nodes and Spleen
Dan L. Longo

This chapter is intended to serve as a guide to the evaluation of patients 
who present with enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) 
or  the  spleen  (splenomegaly).  Lymphadenopathy  is  a  rather  common 
clinical finding in primary care settings, whereas palpable splenomeg-
aly is less so.

LYMPHADENOPATHY
Lymphadenopathy  may  be  an  incidental  finding  in  patients  being 
examined for various reasons, or it may be a presenting sign or symp-
tom  of  the  patient’s  illness.  The  physician  must  eventually  decide 
whether the lymphadenopathy is a normal finding or one that requires 
further  study,  up  to  and  including  biopsy.  Soft,  flat,  submandibular 
nodes (<1 cm) are often palpable in healthy children and young adults; 
healthy adults may have palpable inguinal nodes of up to 2 cm, which 
are  considered  normal.  Further  evaluation  of  these  normal  nodes  is 
not warranted. In contrast, if the physician believes the node(s) to be 
abnormal, then pursuit of a more precise diagnosis is needed.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy  may  be  a  primary  or  secondary  manifestation 
of numerous disorders, as shown in Table 66-1. Many of these dis-
orders are infrequent causes of lymphadenopathy. In primary care 
practice, more than two-thirds of patients with lymphadenopathy 
have nonspecific causes or upper respiratory illnesses (viral or bac-
terial) and <1% have a malignancy. In one study, 84% of patients 
referred for evaluation of lymphadenopathy had a “benign” diagno-
sis. The remaining 16% had a malignancy (lymphoma or metastatic 
adenocarcinoma).  Of  the  patients  with  benign  lymphadenopathy, 
63%  had  a  nonspecific  or  reactive  etiology  (no  causative  agent 
found), and the remainder had a specific cause demonstrated, most 
commonly infectious mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis, or tuberculo-
sis. Thus, the vast majority of patients with lymphadenopathy will 
have a nonspecific etiology requiring few diagnostic tests. 
CLINICAL ASSESSMENT
The physician will be aided in the pursuit of an explanation for the 
lymphadenopathy by a careful medical history, physical examina-
tion,  selected  laboratory  tests,  and  perhaps  an  excisional  lymph 
node biopsy.

The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphade-
nopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, 
night  sweats,  fatigue,  weight  loss,  or  pain  in  the  nodes  should  be

sought. The patient’s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual 
behavior,  and  use  of  drugs  such  as  diphenylhydantoin  are  other 
important historic points. For example, children and young adults 
usually  have  benign  (i.e.,  nonmalignant)  disorders  that  account 
for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper 
respiratory  infections;  infectious  mononucleosis;  toxoplasmosis; 
and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the 
incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign dis-
orders decreases.

The  physical  examination  can  provide  useful  clues  such  as  the 
extent of lymphadenopathy (localized or generalized), size of nodes, 
texture, presence or absence of nodal tenderness, signs of inflamma-
tion over the node, skin lesions, and splenomegaly. A thorough ear, 
nose, and throat (ENT) examination is indicated in adult patients 
with cervical adenopathy and a history of tobacco use. Localized or 
regional adenopathy implies involvement of a single anatomic area. 
Generalized adenopathy has been defined as involvement of three 
or more noncontiguous lymph node areas. Many of the causes of 
lymphadenopathy (Table 66-1) can produce localized or generalized 
adenopathy, so this distinction is of limited utility in the differential 
diagnosis. Nevertheless, generalized lymphadenopathy is frequently 
associated with nonmalignant disorders such as infectious mono-
nucleosis  (Epstein-Barr  virus  [EBV]  or  cytomegalovirus  [CMV]), 
toxoplasmosis, AIDS, other viral infections, systemic lupus eryth-
ematosus  (SLE),  and  mixed  connective  tissue  disease.  Acute  and 
chronic  lymphocytic  leukemias  and  malignant  lymphomas  also 
produce generalized adenopathy in adults.

The  site  of  localized  or  regional  adenopathy  may  provide  a 
useful clue about the cause. Occipital adenopathy often reflects an 
infection  of  the  scalp,  and  preauricular  adenopathy  accompanies 
conjunctival infections and cat-scratch disease. The most frequent 
site of regional adenopathy is the neck, and most of the causes are 
benign—upper respiratory infections, oral and dental lesions, infec-
tious  mononucleosis,  or  other  viral  illnesses.  The  chief  malignant 
causes include metastatic cancer from head and neck, breast, lung, 
and  thyroid  primaries.  Enlargement  of  supraclavicular  and  sca-
lene nodes is always abnormal. Because these nodes drain regions 
of  the  lung  and  retroperitoneal  space,  they  can  reflect  lympho-
mas,  other  cancers,  or  infectious  processes  arising  in  these  areas.   
Virchow’s node is an enlarged left supraclavicular node infiltrated 
with  metastatic  cancer  from  a  gastrointestinal  primary.  Metasta-
ses  to  supraclavicular  nodes  also  occur  from  lung,  breast,  testis, 
or  ovarian  cancers.  Tuberculosis,  sarcoidosis,  and  toxoplasmosis 
are  nonneoplastic  causes  of  supraclavicular  adenopathy.  Axillary 
adenopathy is usually due to injuries or localized infections of the 
ipsilateral  upper  extremity.  Malignant  causes  include  melanoma 
or  lymphoma  and,  in  women,  breast  cancer.  Inguinal  lymphade-
nopathy is usually secondary to infections or trauma of the lower 
extremities and may accompany sexually transmitted diseases such 
as  lymphogranuloma  venereum,  primary  syphilis,  genital  herpes, 
or chancroid. These nodes may also be involved by lymphomas and 
metastatic cancer from primary lesions of the rectum, genitalia, or 
lower extremities (melanoma).

The size and texture of the lymph node(s) and the presence of 
pain  are  useful  parameters  in  evaluating  a  patient  with  lymph-
adenopathy. Nodes <1.0 cm2 in area (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm or less) are 
almost always secondary to benign, nonspecific reactive causes. In 
one retrospective analysis of younger patients (9–25 years) who had 
a lymph node biopsy, a maximum diameter of >2 cm served as one 
discriminant for predicting that the biopsy would reveal malignant 
or  granulomatous  disease.  Another  study  showed  that  a  lymph 
node size of 2.25 cm2 (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) was the best size limit for 
distinguishing malignant or granulomatous lymphadenopathy from 
other causes of lymphadenopathy. Patients with node(s) ≤1.0 cm2 
should be observed after excluding infectious mononucleosis and/
or toxoplasmosis unless there are symptoms and signs of an under-
lying systemic illness.

The texture of lymph nodes may be described as soft, firm, rub-
bery, hard, discrete, matted, tender, movable, or fixed. Tenderness is 
found when the capsule is stretched during rapid enlargement, usu-
ally secondary to an inflammatory process. Some malignant diseases 
such as acute leukemia may produce rapid enlargement and pain in 
the nodes. Nodes involved by lymphoma tend to be large, discrete, 
symmetric, rubbery, firm, mobile, and nontender. Nodes containing 
metastatic cancer are often hard, nontender, and nonmovable because 
of fixation to surrounding tissues. The coexistence of splenomegaly 
in the patient with lymphadenopathy implies a systemic illness such

PART 2Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseasesas infectious mononucleosis, lymphoma, acute or chronic leukemia, 
SLE,  sarcoidosis,  toxoplasmosis,  cat-scratch  disease,  or  other  less 
common hematologic disorders. The patient’s story should provide 
helpful clues about the underlying systemic illness.

Nonsuperficial presentations (thoracic or abdominal) of adenop-
athy are usually detected as the result of a symptom-directed diag-
nostic  workup.  Thoracic  adenopathy  may  be  detected  by  routine 
chest radiography or during the workup for superficial adenopathy. 
It may also be found because the patient complains of a cough or 
wheezing  from  airway  compression;  hoarseness  from  recurrent 
laryngeal nerve involvement; dysphagia from esophageal compres-
sion; or swelling of the neck, face, or arms secondary to compres-
sion of the superior vena cava or subclavian vein. The differential 
diagnosis  of  mediastinal  and  hilar  adenopathy  includes  primary 
lung disorders and systemic illnesses that characteristically involve 
mediastinal or hilar nodes. In the young, mediastinal adenopathy 
is  associated  with  infectious  mononucleosis  and  sarcoidosis.  In 
endemic  regions,  histoplasmosis  can  cause  unilateral  paratracheal 
lymph node involvement that mimics lymphoma. Tuberculosis can 
also cause unilateral adenopathy. In older patients, the differential 
diagnosis  includes  primary  lung  cancer  (especially  among  smok-
ers), lymphomas, metastatic carcinoma (usually lung), tuberculosis, 
fungal infection, and sarcoidosis.

Enlarged  intraabdominal  or  retroperitoneal  nodes  are  usu-
ally  malignant.  Although  tuberculosis  may  present  as  mesenteric 
lymphadenitis,  these  masses  usually  contain  lymphomas  or,  in 
young men, germ cell tumors. 

LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
The  laboratory  investigation  of  patients  with  lymphadenopathy 
must  be  tailored  to  elucidate  the  etiology  suspected  from  the 
patient’s  history  and  physical  findings.  One  study  from  a  family 
practice clinic evaluated 249 younger patients with “enlarged lymph 
nodes, not infected” or “lymphadenitis.” No laboratory studies were 
obtained in 51%. When studies were performed, the most common 
were  a  complete  blood  count  (CBC)  (33%),  throat  culture  (16%), 
chest x-ray (12%), or monospot test (10%). Only eight patients (3%) 
had a node biopsy, and half of those were normal or reactive. The 
CBC can provide useful data for the diagnosis of acute or chronic 
leukemias,  EBV  or  CMV  mononucleosis,  lymphoma  with  a  leu-
kemic  component,  pyogenic  infections,  or  immune  cytopenias  in 
illnesses such as SLE. Serologic studies may demonstrate antibodies 
specific to components of EBV, CMV, HIV, and other viruses; Tox-
oplasma  gondii;  Brucella;  etc.  If  SLE  is  suspected,  antinuclear  and 
anti-DNA antibody studies are warranted.

The  chest  x-ray  is  usually  negative,  but  the  presence  of  a  pul-
monary  infiltrate  or  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy  would  suggest 
tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, primary lung 
cancer, or metastatic cancer and demands further investigation.

A  variety  of  imaging  techniques  (CT,  MRI,  ultrasound,  color 
Doppler  ultrasonography)  have  been  employed  to  differentiate 
benign  from  malignant  lymph  nodes,  especially  in  patients  with 
head and neck cancer. CT and MRI are comparably accurate (65–
90%) in the diagnosis of metastases to cervical lymph nodes. Ultra-
sonography has been used to determine the long (L) axis, short (S) 
axis, and a ratio of long to short axis in cervical nodes. An L/S ratio 
of <2.0 has a sensitivity and a specificity of 95% for distinguishing 
benign and malignant nodes in patients with head and neck cancer. 
This ratio has greater specificity and sensitivity than palpation or 
measurement of either the long or the short axis alone.

The indications for lymph node biopsy are imprecise, yet it is a 
valuable diagnostic tool. The decision to biopsy may be made early 
in a patient’s evaluation or delayed for up to 2 weeks. Prompt biopsy 
should occur if the patient’s history and physical findings suggest a 
malignancy; examples include a solitary, hard, nontender cervical 
node in an older patient who is a chronic user of tobacco; supra-
clavicular adenopathy; and solitary or generalized adenopathy that 
is  firm,  movable,  and  suggestive  of  lymphoma.  If  a  primary  head

and neck cancer is suspected as the basis of a solitary, hard cervical 
node, then a careful ENT examination should be performed. Any 
mucosal lesion that is suspicious for a primary neoplastic process 
should be biopsied first. If no mucosal lesion is detected, an exci-
sional biopsy of the largest node should be performed. Fine-needle 
aspiration  should  not  be  performed  as  the  first  diagnostic  pro-
cedure.  Most  diagnoses  require  more  tissue  than  such  aspiration 
can provide, and it often delays a definitive diagnosis. Fine-needle 
aspiration should be reserved for thyroid nodules and for confirma-
tion of relapse in patients whose primary diagnosis is known. If the 
primary physician is uncertain about whether to proceed to biopsy, 
consultation  with  a  hematologist  or  medical  oncologist  should 
be  helpful.  In  primary  care  practices,  <5%  of  lymphadenopathy 
patients will require a biopsy. That percentage will be considerably 
larger in referral practices, i.e., hematology, oncology, or ENT.

Two groups have reported algorithms that they claim will iden-
tify  more  precisely  those  lymphadenopathy  patients  who  should 
have a biopsy. Both reports were retrospective analyses in referral 
practices. The first study involved patients 9–25 years of age who 
had a node biopsy performed. Three variables were identified that 
predicted  those  young  patients  with  peripheral  lymphadenopathy 
who  should  undergo  biopsy;  lymph  node  size  >2  cm  in  diameter 
and  abnormal  chest  x-ray  had  positive  predictive  values,  whereas 
recent ENT symptoms had negative predictive values. The second 
study  evaluated  220  lymphadenopathy  patients  in  a  hematology 
unit and identified five variables (lymph node size, location [supr-
aclavicular  or  nonsupraclavicular],  age  [>40  years  or  <40  years], 
texture  [nonhard  or  hard],  and  tenderness)  that  were  used  in  a 
mathematical model to identify those patients requiring a biopsy. 
Positive predictive value was found for age >40 years, supraclavicu-
lar location, node size >2.25 cm2, hard texture, and lack of pain or 
tenderness. Negative predictive value was evident for age <40 years, 
node size <1.0 cm2, nonhard texture, and tender or painful nodes. 
Ninety-one  percent  of  those  who  required  biopsy  were  correctly 
classified by this model. Because both of these studies were retro-
spective  analyses  and  one  was  limited  to  young  patients,  it  is  not 
known how useful these models would be if applied prospectively 
in a primary care setting.

Most lymphadenopathy patients do not require a biopsy, and at 
least half require no laboratory studies. If the patient’s history and 
physical  findings  point  to  a  benign  cause  for  lymphadenopathy, 
careful follow-up at a 2- to 4-week interval can be employed. The 
patient should be instructed to return for reevaluation if there is an 
increase in the size of the nodes. Antibiotics are not indicated for 
lymphadenopathy  unless  strong  evidence  of  a  bacterial  infection 
is present. Glucocorticoids should not be used to treat lymphade-
nopathy because their lympholytic effect obscures some diagnoses 
(lymphoma, leukemia, Castleman’s disease) and they contribute to 
delayed healing or activation of underlying infections. An exception 
to this statement is the life-threatening pharyngeal obstruction by 
enlarged  lymphoid  tissue  in  Waldeyer’s  ring  that  is  occasionally 
seen in infectious mononucleosis.

SPLENOMEGALY
 ■ STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE SPLEEN
The spleen is a reticuloendothelial organ that has its embryologic ori-
gin in the dorsal mesogastrium at about 5 weeks’ gestation. It arises in a 
series of hillocks, migrates to its normal adult location in the left upper 
quadrant (LUQ), and is attached to the stomach via the gastrolienal lig-
ament and to the kidney via the lienorenal ligament. When the hillocks 
fail to unify into a single tissue mass, accessory spleens may develop in 
around 20% of persons. The function of the spleen has been elusive. 
Galen believed it was the source of “black bile” or melancholia, and the 
word hypochondria (literally, beneath the ribs) and the idiom “to vent 
one’s spleen” attest to the beliefs that the spleen had an important influ-
ence on the psyche and emotions. In humans, its normal physiologic 
roles seem to be the following:

FIGURE 66-1  Schematic spleen structure. The spleen comprises many units of red 
and white pulp centered around small branches of the splenic artery, called central 
arteries.  White  pulp  is  lymphoid  in  nature  and  contains  B-cell  follicles,  a  marginal 
zone  around  the  follicles,  and  T-cell–rich  areas  sheathing  arterioles.  The  red  pulp 
areas include pulp sinuses and pulp cords. The cords are dead ends. In order to regain 
access to the circulation, red blood cells must traverse tiny openings in the sinusoidal 
lining. Stiff, damaged, or old red cells cannot enter the sinuses. RE, reticuloendothelial.

Hematology in Clinical Practice, 4th ed. New York, McGraw-Hill, 2005.)

1.  Maintenance  of  quality  control  over  erythrocytes  in  the  red  pulp 
by  removal  of  senescent  and  defective  red  blood  cells.  The  spleen 
accomplishes  this  function  through  a  unique  organization  of  its 
parenchyma and vasculature (Fig. 66-1).
2.  Synthesis of antibodies in the white pulp.
3.  The removal of antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood 

cells from the circulation.

An increase in these normal functions may result in splenomegaly.
The  spleen  is  composed  of  red  pulp  and  white  pulp,  which  are  
Malpighi’s terms for the red blood–filled sinuses and reticuloendothe-
lial cell–lined cords and the white lymphoid follicles arrayed within the 
red pulp matrix. The spleen is in the portal circulation. The reason for 
this is unknown but may relate to the fact that lower blood pressure 
allows less rapid flow and minimizes damage to normal erythrocytes. 
Blood flows into the spleen at a rate of about 150 mL/min through the 
splenic artery, which ultimately ramifies into central arterioles. Some 
blood goes from the arterioles to capillaries and then to splenic veins 

and out of the spleen, but the majority of blood from central arterioles 
flows into the macrophage-lined sinuses and cords. The blood enter-
ing  the  sinuses  reenters  the  circulation  through  the  splenic  venules, 
but the blood entering the cords is subjected to an inspection of sorts. 
To return to the circulation, the blood cells in the cords must squeeze 
through  slits  in  the  cord  lining  to  enter  the  sinuses  that  lead  to  the 
venules.  Old  and  damaged  erythrocytes  are  less  deformable  and  are 
retained in the cords, where they are destroyed and their components 
recycled.  Red  cell–inclusion  bodies  such  as  parasites  (Chaps.  224, 
225, and A2), nuclear residua (Howell-Jolly bodies, see Fig. 63-6), or 
denatured hemoglobin (Heinz bodies) are pinched off in the process of 
passing through the slits, a process called pitting. The culling of dead 
and  damaged  cells  and  the  pitting  of  cells  with  inclusions  appear  to 
occur without significant delay because the blood transit time through 
the spleen is only slightly slower than in other organs.

The  spleen  is  also  capable  of  assisting  the  host  in  adapting  to  its 
hostile environment. It has at least three adaptive functions: (1) clear-
ance of bacteria and particulates from the blood, (2) the generation of 
immune responses to certain pathogens, and (3) the generation of cel-
lular components of the blood under circumstances in which the mar-
row is unable to meet the needs (i.e., extramedullary hematopoiesis). 
The latter adaptation is a recapitulation of the blood-forming function 
the  spleen  plays  during  gestation.  In  some  animals,  the  spleen  also 
serves a role in the vascular adaptation to stress because it stores red 
blood cells (often hemoconcentrated to higher hematocrits than nor-
mal) under normal circumstances and contracts under the influence of 
β-adrenergic stimulation to provide the animal with an autotransfusion 
and improved oxygen-carrying capacity. However, the normal human 
spleen does not sequester or store red blood cells and does not contract 
in response to sympathetic stimuli. The normal human spleen contains 
approximately  one-third  of  the  total  body  platelets  and  a  significant 
number of marginated neutrophils. These sequestered cells are avail-
able when needed to respond to bleeding or infection.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Splenomegaly 

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT
The  most  common  symptoms  produced  by  diseases  involving  the 
spleen  are  pain  and  a  heavy  sensation  in  the  LUQ.  Massive  sple-
nomegaly  may  cause  early  satiety.  Pain  may  result  from  acute 
swelling  of  the  spleen  with  stretching  of  the  capsule,  infarction, 
or  inflammation  of  the  capsule.  For  many  years,  it  was  believed 
that  splenic  infarction  was  clinically  silent,  which,  at  times,  is 
true.  However,  Soma  Weiss,  in  his  classic  1942  report  of  the  self- 
observations by a Harvard medical student on the clinical course of 
subacute bacterial endocarditis, documented that severe LUQ and 
pleuritic chest pain may accompany thromboembolic occlusion of 
splenic blood flow. Vascular occlusion, with infarction and pain, is 
commonly  seen  in  children  with  sickle  cell  crises.  Rupture  of  the 
spleen,  from  either  trauma  or  infiltrative  disease  that  breaks  the 
capsule,  may  result  in  intraperitoneal  bleeding,  shock,  and  death. 
The rupture itself may be painless.

A palpable spleen is the major physical sign produced by diseases 
affecting  the  spleen  and  suggests  enlargement  of  the  organ.  The 
normal spleen weighs <250 g, decreases in size with age, normally 
lies  entirely  within  the  rib  cage,  has  a  maximum  cephalocaudad 
diameter of 13 cm by ultrasonography or maximum length of 12 cm 
and/or width of 7 cm by radionuclide scan, and is usually not palpa-
ble. However, a palpable spleen was found in 3% of 2200 asymptom-
atic, male, freshman college students. Follow-up at 3 years revealed 
that 30% of those students still had a palpable spleen without any 
increase  in  disease  prevalence.  Ten-year  follow-up  found  no  evi-
dence  for  lymphoid  malignancies.  Furthermore,  in  some  tropical 
countries  (e.g.,  New  Guinea),  the  incidence  of  splenomegaly  may 
reach 60%. Thus, the presence of a palpable spleen does not always 
equate  with  presence  of  disease.  Even  when  disease  is  present,

reaction to it. For example, in patients with Hodgkin’s disease, only 
two-thirds of the palpable spleens show involvement by the cancer.
Physical examination of the spleen uses primarily the techniques 
of  palpation  and  percussion.  Inspection  may  reveal  fullness  in 
the LUQ that descends on inspiration, a finding associated with a 
massively enlarged spleen. Auscultation may reveal a venous hum 
or friction rub.

Palpation  can  be  accomplished  by  bimanual  palpation,  bal-
lotment,  and  palpation  from  above  (Middleton  maneuver).  For 
bimanual palpation, which is at least as reliable as the other tech-
niques, the patient is supine with flexed knees. The examiner’s left 
hand is placed on the lower rib cage and pulls the skin toward the 
costal margin, allowing the fingertips of the right hand to feel the 
tip  of  the  spleen  as  it  descends  while  the  patient  inspires  slowly, 
smoothly, and deeply. Palpation is begun with the right hand in the 
left lower quadrant with gradual movement toward the left costal 
margin, thereby identifying the lower edge of a massively enlarged 
spleen. When the spleen tip is felt, the finding is recorded as cen-
timeters below the left costal margin at some arbitrary point, i.e., 
10–15 cm, from the midpoint of the umbilicus or the xiphisternal 
junction. This allows other examiners to compare findings or the 
initial examiner to determine changes in size over time. Bimanual 
palpation in the right lateral decubitus position adds nothing to the 
supine examination.

Percussion for splenic dullness is accomplished with any of three 

techniques described by Nixon, Castell, or Barkun:

1.  Nixon’s method: The patient is placed on the right side so that the 
spleen lies above the colon and stomach. Percussion begins at 
the lower level of pulmonary resonance in the posterior axillary 
line and proceeds diagonally along a perpendicular line toward 
the lower midanterior costal margin. The upper border of dull-
ness is normally 6–8 cm above the costal margin. Dullness >8 cm 
in an adult is presumed to indicate splenic enlargement.

2.  Castell’s  method:  With  the  patient  supine,  percussion  in  the 
lowest intercostal space in the anterior axillary line (8th or 9th) 
produces a resonant note if the spleen is normal in size. This is 
true during expiration or full inspiration. A dull percussion note 
on full inspiration suggests splenomegaly.

3.  Percussion of Traube’s semilunar space: The borders of Traube’s space 
are the sixth rib superiorly, the left midaxillary line laterally, and the 
left costal margin inferiorly. The patient is supine with the left arm 
slightly abducted. During normal breathing, this space is percussed 
from medial to lateral margins, yielding a normal resonant sound. 
A dull percussion note suggests splenomegaly.

Studies comparing methods of percussion and palpation with a 
standard  of  ultrasonography  or  scintigraphy  have  revealed  sensi-
tivity of 56–71% for palpation and 59–82% for percussion. Repro-
ducibility among examiners is better for palpation than percussion. 
Both techniques are less reliable in obese patients or patients who 
have just eaten. Thus, the physical examination techniques of pal-
pation and percussion are imprecise at best. It has been suggested 
that the examiner perform percussion first and, if positive, proceed 
to palpation; if the spleen is palpable, then one can be reasonably 
confident  that  splenomegaly  exists.  However,  not  all  LUQ  masses 
are  enlarged  spleens;  gastric  or  colon  tumors  and  pancreatic  or 
renal cysts or tumors can mimic splenomegaly.

The presence of an enlarged spleen can be more precisely deter-
mined, if necessary, by liver-spleen radionuclide scan, CT, MRI, or 
ultrasonography.  The  latter  technique  is  the  current  procedure  of 
choice for routine assessment of spleen size (normal = a maximum 
cephalocaudad  diameter  of  13  cm)  because  it  has  high  sensitivity 
and  specificity  and  is  safe,  noninvasive,  quick,  mobile,  and  less 
costly. Equipment advances allow ultrasonography to be performed 
at  the  bedside  with  excellent  sensitivity  and  specificity.  Nuclear 
medicine  scans  are  accurate,  sensitive,  and  reliable  but  are  costly,

require greater time to generate data, and use immobile equipment. 
They have the advantage of demonstrating accessory splenic tissue. 
CT  and  MRI  provide  accurate  determination  of  spleen  size,  but 
the equipment is immobile and the procedures are expensive. MRI 
appears to offer no advantage over CT. Changes in spleen structure 
such as mass lesions, infarcts, inhomogeneous infiltrates, and cysts 
are more readily assessed by CT, MRI, or ultrasonography. None of 
these techniques is very reliable in the detection of patchy infiltra-
tion (e.g., Hodgkin’s disease). 

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Many  of  the  diseases  associated  with  splenomegaly  are  listed  in 
Table  66-2.  They  are  grouped  according  to  the  presumed  basic 
mechanisms responsible for organ enlargement:

1.  Hyperplasia or hypertrophy related to a particular splenic func-
tion such as reticuloendothelial hyperplasia (work hypertrophy) 
in diseases such as hereditary spherocytosis or thalassemia syn-
dromes  that  require  removal  of  large  numbers  of  defective  red 
blood cells; immune hyperplasia in response to systemic infec-
tion (infectious mononucleosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis) 
or  to  immunologic  diseases  (immune  thrombocytopenia,  SLE, 
Felty’s syndrome).

2.  Passive congestion due to decreased blood flow from the spleen 
in conditions that produce portal hypertension (cirrhosis, Budd- 
Chiari syndrome, congestive heart failure).

3.  Infiltrative diseases of the spleen (lymphomas, metastatic cancer, 
amyloidosis, Gaucher’s disease, myeloproliferative disorders with 
extramedullary hematopoiesis).

The differential diagnostic possibilities are much fewer when the 
spleen is “massively enlarged” or palpable >8 cm below the left costal 
margin or its drained weight is ≥1000 g (Table 66-3). The vast major-
ity of such patients will have non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lym-
phocytic  leukemia,  hairy  cell  leukemia,  chronic  myeloid  leukemia, 
myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, or polycythemia vera. 

LABORATORY ASSESSMENT
The major laboratory abnormalities accompanying splenomegaly are 
determined  by  the  underlying  systemic  illness.  Erythrocyte  counts 
may be normal, decreased (thalassemia major syndromes, SLE, cirrho-
sis with portal hypertension), or increased (polycythemia vera). Gran-
ulocyte counts may be normal, decreased (Felty’s syndrome, congestive 
splenomegaly,  leukemias),  or  increased  (infections  or  inflammatory 
disease,  myeloproliferative  disorders).  Similarly,  the  platelet  count 
may be normal, decreased when there is enhanced sequestration or 
destruction of platelets in an enlarged spleen (congestive splenomeg-
aly,  Gaucher’s  disease,  immune  thrombocytopenia),  or  increased  in 
the myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera.

The CBC may reveal cytopenia of one or more blood cell types, 
which  should  suggest  hypersplenism.  This  condition  is  character-
ized  by  splenomegaly,  cytopenia(s),  normal  or  hyperplastic  bone 
marrow,  and  a  response  to  splenectomy.  The  latter  characteristic 
is  less  precise  because  reversal  of  cytopenia,  particularly  granu-
locytopenia,  is  sometimes  not  sustained  after  splenectomy.  The 
cytopenias  result  from  increased  destruction  of  the  cellular  ele-
ments  secondary  to  reduced  flow  of  blood  through  enlarged  and 
congested cords (congestive splenomegaly) or to immune-mediated 
mechanisms. In hypersplenism, various cell types usually have nor-
mal morphology on the peripheral blood smear, although the red 
cells may be spherocytic due to loss of surface area during their lon-
ger transit through the enlarged spleen. The increased marrow pro-
duction of red cells should be reflected as an increased reticulocyte 
production index, although the value may be less than expected due 
to increased sequestration of reticulocytes in the spleen.

The need for additional laboratory studies is dictated by the dif-
ferential diagnosis of the underlying illness of which splenomegaly 
is a manifestation.

control  in  patients  with  traumatic  splenic  rupture,  or  for  correction 
of  cytopenias  in  patients  with  hypersplenism  or  immune-mediated 
destruction  of  one  or  more  cellular  blood  elements.  Splenectomy  is 
necessary for staging of patients with Hodgkin’s disease only in those 
with clinical stage I or II disease in whom radiation therapy alone is 
contemplated  as  the  treatment.  Noninvasive  staging  of  the  spleen  in 
Hodgkin’s disease is not a sufficiently reliable basis for treatment deci-
sions because one-third of normal-sized spleens will be involved with 
Hodgkin’s disease and one-third of enlarged spleens will be tumor-free. 
The widespread use of systemic therapy to test all stages of Hodgkin’s 
disease  has  made  staging  laparotomy  with  splenectomy  unnecessary. 
Although splenectomy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) does not 
affect  the  natural  history  of  disease,  removal  of  the  massive  spleen 
usually  makes  patients  significantly  more  comfortable  and  simplifies 
their management by significantly reducing transfusion requirements.

The improvements in therapy of CML have reduced the need for sple-
nectomy for symptom control. Splenectomy is an effective secondary 
or tertiary treatment for two chronic B-cell leukemias, hairy cell leuke-
mia and prolymphocytic leukemia, and for the very rare splenic mantle 
cell or marginal zone lymphoma. Splenectomy in these diseases may be 
associated with significant tumor regression in bone marrow and other 
sites of disease. Similar regressions of systemic disease have been noted 
after splenic irradiation in some types of lymphoid tumors, especially 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytic leukemia. This has 
been termed the abscopal effect. Such systemic tumor responses to local 
therapy directed at the spleen suggest that some hormone or growth 
factor produced by the spleen may affect tumor cell proliferation, but 
this  conjecture  is  not  yet  substantiated.  A  common  therapeutic  indi-
cation for splenectomy is traumatic or iatrogenic splenic rupture. In a 
fraction of patients with splenic rupture, peritoneal seeding of splenic 
fragments can lead to splenosis—the presence of multiple rests of spleen 
tissue not connected to the portal circulation. This ectopic spleen tissue 
may cause pain or gastrointestinal obstruction, as in endometriosis. A 
large number of hematologic, immunologic, and congestive causes of 
splenomegaly  can  lead  to  destruction  of  one  or  more  cellular  blood 
elements.  In  the  majority  of  such  cases,  splenectomy  can  correct  the 
cytopenias,  particularly  anemia  and  thrombocytopenia.  In  a  large 
series  of  patients  seen  in  two  tertiary  care  centers,  the  indication  for 
splenectomy  was  diagnostic  in  10%  of  patients,  therapeutic  in  44%, 
staging for Hodgkin’s disease in 20%, and incidental to another proce-
dure in 26%. Perhaps the only contraindication to splenectomy is the 
presence  of  marrow  failure,  in  which  the  enlarged  spleen  is  the  only 
source of hematopoietic tissue.

Often the splenectomy is done by laparoscopy, which is associated 
with  shorter  hospital  stays  and  faster  recovery  than  the  open  proce-
dure;  however,  concern  has  emerged  that  the  laparoscopic  approach 
is associated with a higher risk of postoperative portal venous system 
thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome.

The  absence  of  the  spleen  has  minimal  long-term  effects  on  the 
hematologic  profile.  In  the  immediate  postsplenectomy  period,  leu-
kocytosis  (up  to  25,000/μL)  and  thrombocytosis  (up  to  1  ×  106/μL) 
may develop, but within 2–3 weeks, blood cell counts and survival of 
each  cell  lineage  are  usually  normal.  The  chronic  manifestations  of 
splenectomy  are  marked  variation  in  size  and  shape  of  erythrocytes 
(anisocytosis, poikilocytosis) and the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies 
(nuclear remnants), Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin), basophilic 
stippling,  and  an  occasional  nucleated  erythrocyte  in  the  peripheral 
blood. When such erythrocyte abnormalities appear in a patient whose 
spleen has not been removed, one should suspect splenic infiltration by 
tumor that has interfered with its normal culling and pitting function.
The  most  serious  consequence  of  splenectomy  is  increased  sus-
ceptibility  to  bacterial  infections,  particularly  those  with  capsules 
such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and some 
gram-negative enteric organisms. Patients aged <20 years are particu-
larly susceptible to overwhelming sepsis with S. pneumoniae, and the 
overall actuarial risk of sepsis in patients who have had their spleens 
removed is about 7% in 10 years. The case-fatality rate for pneumococ-
cal sepsis in splenectomized patients is 50–80%. About 25% of patients 
without spleens will develop a serious infection at some time in their 
life. The frequency is highest within the first 3 years after splenectomy. 
About  15%  of  the  infections  are  polymicrobial,  and  lung,  skin,  and 
blood are the most common sites. No increased risk of viral infection 
has  been  noted  in  patients  who  have  no  spleen.  The  susceptibility 
to  bacterial  infections  relates  to  the  inability  to  remove  opsonized 
bacteria  from  the  bloodstream  and  a  defect  in  making  antibodies  to 
T-cell–independent antigens such as the polysaccharide components of 
bacterial capsules. Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered to all 
patients 2 weeks before elective splenectomy. The Advisory Committee 
on  Immunization  Practices  recommends  that  these  patients  receive 

repeat  vaccination  5  years  after  splenectomy.  Efficacy  has  not  been 
proven for this group, and the recommendation discounts the possi-
bility  that  administration  of  the  vaccine  may  actually  lower  the  titer 
of specific pneumococcal antibodies. A more effective pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine that involves T cells in the response is now available 
(PCV13). The vaccine to Neisseria meningitidis should also be given to 
patients in whom elective splenectomy is planned. Although efficacy 
data  for  Haemophilus  influenzae  type  b  vaccine  are  not  available  for 
older  children  or  adults,  it  may  be  given  to  patients  who  have  had  a 
splenectomy.

Splenectomized patients should be educated to consider any unex-
plained fever as a medical emergency. Prompt medical attention with 
evaluation  and  treatment  of  suspected  bacteremia  may  be  lifesaving. 
Routine chemoprophylaxis with oral penicillin can result in the emer-
gence of drug-resistant strains and is not recommended.

In  addition  to  an  increased  susceptibility  to  bacterial  infections, 
splenectomized patients are also more susceptible to the parasitic dis-
ease babesiosis. The splenectomized patient should avoid areas where 
the parasite Babesia is endemic (e.g., Cape Cod, MA).

Surgical removal of the spleen is an obvious cause of hyposplenism. 
Patients with sickle cell disease often suffer from autosplenectomy as a 
result of splenic destruction by the numerous infarcts associated with 
sickle cell crises during childhood. Indeed, the presence of a palpable 
spleen in a patient with sickle cell disease after age 5 suggests a coexist-
ing hemoglobinopathy, e.g., thalassemia or hemoglobin C. In addition, 
patients who receive splenic irradiation for a neoplastic or autoimmune 
disease  are  also  functionally  hyposplenic.  The  term  hyposplenism  is 
preferred to asplenism in referring to the physiologic consequences of 
splenectomy  because  asplenia  is  a  rare,  specific,  and  fatal  congenital 
abnormality  in  which  there  is  a  failure  of  the  left  side  of  the  coelo-
mic cavity (which includes the splenic anlagen) to develop normally. 
Infants with asplenia have no spleens, but that is the least of their prob-
lems. The right side of the developing embryo is duplicated on the left 
so there is liver where the spleen should be, there are two right lungs, 
and the heart comprises two right atria and two right ventricles.

Principles of Clinical 
Pharmacology
Dan M. Roden

Drugs  are  the  cornerstone  of modern therapeutics. Nevertheless,  it  is 
well  recognized  among  health  care  providers  and  the  lay  community 
that  the  outcome  of  drug  therapy  varies  widely  among  individuals. 
While this variability has been perceived as an unpredictable, and there-
fore inevitable, accompaniment of drug therapy, this is not the case.

Drugs interact with specific target molecules to produce their ben-
eficial and adverse effects. The chain of events between administration 
of a drug and production of these effects in the body can be divided 
into two components, both of which contribute to variability in drug 
actions. The first component comprises the processes that determine 
drug  delivery  to,  and  removal  from,  molecular  targets.  The  resulting 
description  of  the  relationship  between  drug  concentration  and  time 
is  termed  pharmacokinetics.  The  second  component  of  variability  in 
drug action comprises the processes that determine variability in drug 
actions  independent  of  variability  in  drug  delivery  to  effector  drug 
sites. This description of the relationship between drug concentration 
and  effect  is  termed  pharmacodynamics.  As  discussed  further  below, 
pharmacodynamic variability can arise as a result of variability in func-
tion of the target molecule itself or of variability in the broad biologic 
context  in  which  the  drug-target  interaction  occurs  to  achieve  drug 
effects.  The  principles  described  below  were  developed  by  studying 
small drug molecules but are equally useful in describing the effects of 
very  large  molecules,  such  as  the  therapeutic  antibodies  increasingly 
applied to autoimmune diseases and cancer.

Two  important  goals  of  clinical  pharmacology  are  (1)  to  provide 
a  description  of  conditions  under  which  drug  actions  vary  among 
human  subjects;  and  (2)  to  determine  mechanisms  underlying  this 
variability, with the goal of improving therapy with available drugs as 
well as pointing to mechanisms whose targeting by new drugs may be 
effective  in  the  treatment  of  human  disease.  The  drug  development 
process is briefly described at the end of this chapter.

The  first  steps  in  the  discipline  of  clinical  pharmacology  were 
empirical descriptions of the influence of disease on drug actions and 
of  individuals  or  families  with  unusual  sensitivities  to  adverse  drug 
reactions (ADRs). These important descriptive findings are now being 
replaced by an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying 
variability in drug actions. Importantly, it is often the personal inter-
action of the patient with the physician or other health care provider 
that  first  identifies  unusual  variability  in  drug  actions;  maintained 
alertness to unusual drug responses continues to be a key component 
of improving drug safety.

One  useful  unifying  framework  is  to  consider  that  the  effects  of 
disease, drug coadministration, or familial factors in modulating drug 
action  reflect  variability  in  expression  or  function  of  specific  genes 
whose products determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
This idea forms the basis for pharmacogenomic science; a few examples 
are cited in this chapter, and further details are addressed in Chap. 68.
 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
It is true across all cultures and diseases that factors such as compliance, 
genetic  variants  affecting  pharmacokinetics  or  pharmacodynamics 
(which themselves vary by ancestry), and drug interactions contribute 
to  drug  responses.  Cost  issues  or  cultural  factors  may  determine  the 
likelihood that specific drugs, drug combinations, or over-the-counter 
(OTC) remedies are prescribed. The broad principles of clinical phar-
macology  enunciated  here  can  be  used  to  analyze  the  mechanisms 
underlying successful or unsuccessful therapy with any drug.

 ■ INDICATIONS FOR DRUG THERAPY: RISK VERSUS 
BENEFIT
It  is  self-evident  that  the  benefits  of  drug  therapy  should  outweigh 
the  risks.  Benefits  fall  into  broad  categories:  alleviation  of  symptoms, 
prevention of disease progression or complications, and prolonged life. 
However, establishing the balance between risk and benefit for an indi-
vidual patient is not always simple. In addition to variability seen even 
within highly controlled drug trials, patients treated in clinical settings 
may display responses that were not observed in trials, sometimes due 
to comorbidities that were trial exclusion criteria. In addition, therapies 
that provide symptomatic benefits but shorten life may be entertained in 
patients with serious and highly symptomatic diseases such as heart fail-
ure or cancer. These considerations illustrate the continuing, highly per-
sonal nature of the relationship between the prescriber and the patient.

Adverse  Effects  Some  adverse  effects  are  so  common  and  so 
readily associated with drug therapy that they are identified very early 
during clinical use of a drug. By contrast, serious ADRs may be suffi-
ciently  uncommon  that  they  escape  detection  for  many  years  after  a 
drug begins to be widely used. The issue of how to identify rare but 
serious  ADRs  (that  can  profoundly  affect  the  benefit-risk  perception 
in an individual patient) has not been satisfactorily resolved. Potential 
approaches  range  from  an  increased  understanding  of  the  molecular 
and genetic basis of variability in drug actions to expanded postmar-
keting surveillance mechanisms. None of these have been completely 
effective, so practitioners must be continuously vigilant to the possibil-
ity that unusual symptoms may be related to specific drugs, or combi-
nations of drugs, that their patients receive.

Therapeutic  Index  Beneficial  and  adverse  reactions  to  drug 
therapy  can  be  described  by  a  series  of  dose-response  relations  
(Fig. 67-1). Well-tolerated drugs demonstrate a wide margin, termed 
the therapeutic ratio, therapeutic index, or therapeutic window, between 
the doses required to produce a therapeutic effect and those producing 
toxicity. In cases where there is a similar relationship between plasma 
drug  concentration  and  effects,  monitoring  plasma  concentrations 
can  be  a  highly  effective  aid  in  managing  drug  therapy  by  enabling 
concentrations  to  be  maintained  above  the  minimum  required  to 
produce an effect and below the concentration range likely to produce 
toxicity. Such monitoring has been widely used to guide therapy with 
specific  agents,  such  as  certain  antiarrhythmics,  anticonvulsants, 
and antibiotics. Many of the principles in clinical pharmacology and

Dose or concentration

FIGURE 67-1  The concept of a therapeutic ratio. Each panel illustrates the relationship 
between increasing dose and cumulative probability of a desired or adverse drug 
effect. Top. A drug with a wide therapeutic ratio, that is, a wide separation of the 
two curves. Bottom. A drug with a narrow therapeutic ratio; here, the likelihood of 
adverse effects at therapeutic doses is increased because the curves are not well 
separated. Further, a steep dose-response curve for adverse effects is especially 
undesirable, as it implies that even small dosage increments may sharply increase 
the  likelihood  of  toxicity.  When  there  is  a  definable  relationship  between  drug 
concentration  (usually  measured  in  plasma)  and  desirable  and  adverse  effect 
curves, concentration may be substituted on the abscissa. Note that not all patients 
necessarily demonstrate a therapeutic response (or adverse effect) at any dose and 
that some effects (notably some adverse effects) may occur in a dose-independent 
fashion.

examples outlined below, which can be applied broadly to therapeutics, 
have been developed in these arenas.

Systemic circulation

PRINCIPLES OF PHARMACOKINETICS
The processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion—
collectively  termed  drug  disposition—determine  the  concentration  of 
drug delivered to target effector molecules.

 ■ ABSORPTION AND BIOAVAILABILITY
When a drug is administered orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, 
rectally, sublingually, or directly into desired sites of action, the amount 
of drug eventually entering the systemic circulation may be less than 
with the intravenous route (Fig. 67-2A). The fraction of drug available 
to  the  systemic  circulation  by  other  routes  is  termed  bioavailability. 
Bioavailability  may  be  <100%  for  two  main  reasons:  (1)  incomplete 
absorption,  or  (2)  metabolism  or  elimination  prior  to  entering  the 
systemic circulation.

Compared to the same dose given intravenously, a nonintravenous 
dose will have a later and lower peak plasma concentration (Fig. 67-2). 
Drug  absorption  may  be  reduced  because  a  drug  is  incompletely 
released  from  its  dosage  form,  undergoes  destruction  at  the  site  of 
administration, or has physicochemical properties such as insolubility 
that  prevent  complete  absorption  from  its  site  of  administration. 
Slow absorption rates are deliberately designed into “slow-release” or  
“sustained-release” drug formulations in order to minimize variation in 
plasma concentrations during the interval between doses. Therapeutic 
antibodies  administered  subcutaneously  may  take  days  to  reach  the 
systemic circulation.

“First-Pass”  Effect  When  a  drug  is  administered  orally,  it  must 
traverse  the  intestinal  epithelium,  the  portal  venous  system,  and  the 
liver  prior  to  entering  the  systemic  circulation  (Fig.  67-3).  Once  a 
drug enters the enterocyte, it may undergo metabolism, be transported 
into  the  portal  vein,  or  be  excreted  back  into  the  intestinal  lumen. 
Both  excretion  into  the  intestinal  lumen  and  metabolism  decrease 
bioavailability. Once a drug passes this enterocyte barrier, it may also 
be taken up into the hepatocyte, where bioavailability can be further 
limited by metabolism or excretion into the bile. This elimination in

indicating incomplete bioavailability. Note that despite this incomplete bioavailability, 
concentration  after  the  oral  dose  can  be  higher  than  after  the  IV  dose  at  some 
time points. The inset shows that the decline of concentrations over time is linear

FIGURE  67-3  Mechanism  of  presystemic  elimination.  After  drug  enters  the 
enterocyte,  it  can  undergo  metabolism,  excretion  into  the  intestinal  lumen,  or 
transport into the portal vein. Similarly, the hepatocyte may accomplish metabolism 
and  biliary  excretion  prior  to  the  entry  of  drug  and  metabolites  to  the  systemic 
circulation.  (Adapted  by  permission  from  DM  Roden,  in  DP  Zipes,  J  Jalife  [eds]:

intestine and liver, which reduces the amount of drug delivered to the 
systemic  circulation,  is  termed  presystemic  elimination,  presystemic 
extraction, or first-pass elimination.
 ■ DRUG TRANSPORT
Drug movement across the membrane of any cell, including enterocytes 
and hepatocytes, is a combination of passive diffusion and active transport, 
mediated  by  specific  drug  uptake  and  efflux  molecules.  One  widely 
studied drug transport molecule is the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein, 
the product of the ABCB1 (or MDR1) gene. P-glycoprotein is expressed 
on  the  apical  aspect  of  the  enterocyte  and  on  the  canalicular  aspect 
of  the  hepatocyte  (Fig.  67-3).  In  both  locations,  it  serves  as  an 
efflux  pump,  limiting  availability  of  drug  to  the  systemic  circulation. 
P-glycoprotein–mediated  drug  efflux  from  cerebral  capillaries  limits 
drug brain penetration and is an important component of the blood-
brain barrier. Other transporters mediate uptake into cells of drugs and 
endogenous substrates such as vitamins or nutrients.
 ■ DRUG METABOLISM
Drug  metabolism  generates  compounds  that  are  usually  more  polar 
and, hence, more readily excreted than parent drug. Metabolism takes 
place  predominantly  in  the  liver  but  can  occur  at  other  sites  such  as 
kidney,  intestinal  epithelium,  lung,  and  plasma.  Phase  I  metabolism 
involves chemical modification, most often oxidation accomplished by 
members  of  the  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  monooxygenase  superfam-
ily.  CYPs  and  other  molecules  that  are  especially  important  for  drug 
metabolism are presented in Table 67-1, and each drug may be a sub-
strate for one or more of these enzymes. Phase II metabolism involves 
conjugation  of  specific  endogenous  compounds  to  drugs  or  their 
metabolites. The enzymes that accomplish phase II reactions include 
glucuronyl-, acetyl-, sulfo-, and methyltransferases. Drug metabolites

may  exert  important  pharmacologic  activity,  as  discussed  further 
below.  Therapeutic  antibodies  are  very  slowly  eliminated  (allowing 
infrequent  dosing,  e.g.,  monthly  injections),  probably  by  lysosomal 
uptake and degradation.

Clinical  Implications  of  Altered  Bioavailability  Some  drugs 
undergo  near-complete  presystemic  metabolism  and  thus  cannot  be 
administered orally. Nitroglycerin cannot be used orally because it is 
completely  extracted  prior  to  reaching  the  systemic  circulation.  The 
drug is, therefore, used by the sublingual, transdermal, or intravascular 
routes, which bypass presystemic metabolism.

Some drugs with very extensive presystemic metabolism can still be 
administered  by  the  oral  route,  using  much  higher  doses  than  those 
required intravenously. Thus, a typical intravenous dose of verapamil is 
1–5 mg, compared to a usual single oral dose of 40–120 mg. Administration

of low-dose aspirin can result in exposure of cyclooxygenase in platelets 
in  the  portal  vein  to  the  drug,  but  systemic  sparing  because  of  first-
pass aspirin deacylation in the liver. This is an example of presystemic 
metabolism being exploited to therapeutic advantage.
 ■ PLASMA HALF-LIFE
Most pharmacokinetic processes, such as elimination, are first-order; 
that is, the rate of the process depends on the amount of drug present. 
Elimination can occasionally be zero-order (fixed amount eliminated 
per unit time), and this can be clinically important (see “Principles of 
Dose Selection,” later in this chapter). In the simplest pharmacokinetic 
model (Fig. 67-2A), a drug bolus (D) is administered instantaneously 
to  a  central  compartment,  from  which  drug  elimination  occurs  as  a 
first-order process. Occasionally, central and other compartments cor-
respond to physiologic spaces (e.g., plasma volume), whereas in other 
cases,  they  are  simply  mathematical  functions  used  to  describe  drug 
disposition.  The  first-order  nature  of  drug  elimination  leads  directly 
to  the  relationship  describing  drug  concentration  (C)  at  any  time  (t) 
following the bolus:

C

=

D
V
c

−
( 0.69t/t

)

• e

where Vc is the volume of the compartment into which drug is delivered 
and t1/2 is elimination half-life. As a consequence of this relationship,  
a plot of the logarithm of concentration versus time is a straight line 
(Fig. 67-2A, inset). Half-life is the time required for 50% of a first-order 
process  to  be  completed.  Thus,  50%  of  drug  elimination  is  achieved 
after one drug-elimination half-life, 75% after two, 87.5% after three, 
etc.  In  practice,  first-order  processes  such  as  elimination  are  near- 
complete after four to five half-lives.

In some cases, drug is removed from the central compartment not 
only by elimination but also by distribution into peripheral compart-
ments. In this case, the plot of plasma concentration versus time after 
a  bolus  may  demonstrate  two  (or  more)  exponential  components  
(Fig. 67-2B). In general, the initial rapid drop in drug concentration 
represents not elimination but drug distribution into and out of periph-
eral  tissues  (also  first-order  processes),  while  the  slower  component 
represents  drug  elimination;  the  initial  precipitous  decline  is  usually 
evident  with  administration  by  intravenous  but  not  by  other  routes. 
Drug  concentrations  at  peripheral  sites  are  determined  by  a  balance 
between  drug  distribution  to  and  redistribution  from  those  sites,  as 
well  as  by  elimination.  Once  distribution  is  near-complete  (four  to 
five  distribution  half-lives),  plasma  and  tissue  concentrations  decline 
in parallel.

Clinical Implications of Half-Life Measurements  The elimi-
nation half-life not only determines the time required for drug concen-
trations to fall to near-immeasurable levels after a single bolus, it is also 
the sole determinant of the time required for steady-state plasma concen-
trations to be achieved after any change in drug dosing (Fig. 67-4). This 
applies to the initiation of chronic drug therapy (whether by multiple 
oral doses or by continuous intravenous infusion), a change in chronic 
drug dose or dosing interval, or discontinuation of drug.

Steady  state  describes  the  situation  during  chronic  drug  adminis-
tration  when  the  amount  of  drug  administered  per  unit  time  equals 
drug eliminated per unit time. With a continuous intravenous infusion, 
plasma concentrations at steady state are stable, while with chronic oral 
drug  administration,  plasma  concentrations  vary  during  the  dosing 
interval,  but  the  time-concentration  profile  between  dosing  intervals 
is stable (Fig. 67-4).
 ■ DRUG DISTRIBUTION
In a typical 70-kg human, plasma volume is ∼3 L, blood volume is ∼5.5 L, 
and extracellular water outside the vasculature is ∼20 L. The volume of 
distribution of drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins but not to 
tissue components approaches plasma volume; warfarin is an example. 
By contrast, for drugs highly bound to tissues, the volume of distribution 
can be far greater than any physiologic space. For example, the volume 
of  distribution  of  digoxin  and  tricyclic  antidepressants  is  hundreds

administered (arrows) at intervals = 50% of the elimination half-life. Steady state is 
achieved during initiation of therapy after ∼5 elimination half-lives, or 10 doses. A

of  liters,  obviously  exceeding  total-body  volume.  Such  drugs  are  not 
readily removed by dialysis, an important consideration in overdose.

Clinical  Implications  of  Drug  Distribution 
In  some  cases, 
pharmacologic effects require drug distribution to peripheral sites. In 
this  instance,  the  time  course  of  drug  delivery  to  and  removal  from 
these sites determines the time course of drug effects; anesthetic uptake 
into the central nervous system (CNS) is an example.
LOADING  DOSES  For  some  drugs,  the  indication  may  be  so  urgent 
that  administration  of  “loading”  dosages  is  required  to  achieve  rapid 
elevations  of  drug  concentration  and  therapeutic  effects  earlier  than 
with chronic maintenance therapy (Fig. 67-4). Nevertheless, the time 
required for a true steady state to be achieved is still determined only 
by the elimination half-life.
RATE  OF  INTRAVENOUS  DRUG  ADMINISTRATION  Although  the  sim-
ulations  in  Fig.  67-2  use  a  single  intravenous  bolus,  this  is  usually 
inappropriate in practice because side effects related to transiently very 
high concentrations can result. Rather, drugs are more usually admin-
istered orally or as a slower intravenous infusion. Some drugs are so 
predictably  lethal  when  infused  too  rapidly  that  special  precautions 
should be taken to prevent accidental boluses. For example, solutions 
of  potassium  for  intravenous  administration  >20  mEq/L  should  be 
avoided  in  all  but  the  most  exceptional  and  carefully  monitored  cir-
cumstances.  This  minimizes  the  possibility  of  cardiac  arrest  due  to 
accidental increases in infusion rates of more concentrated solutions.
Transiently high drug concentrations after rapid intravenous admin-
istration can occasionally be used to advantage. The use of midazolam 
for intravenous sedation, for example, depends upon its rapid uptake 
by the brain during the distribution phase to produce sedation quickly, 
with subsequent egress from the brain during the redistribution of the 
drug as equilibrium is achieved.

Similarly,  adenosine  must  be  administered  as  a  rapid  bolus  in  the 
treatment  of  reentrant  supraventricular  tachycardias  (Chap.  246)  to 
prevent elimination by very rapid (t1/2 of seconds) uptake into erythro-
cytes and endothelial cells before the drug can reach its clinical site of 
action, the atrioventricular node.

Clinical Implications of Altered Protein Binding  Many drugs 
circulate  in  the  plasma  partly  bound  to  plasma  proteins.  Since  only 
unbound  (free)  drug  can  distribute  to  sites  of  pharmacologic  action, 

drug  response  is  related  to  the  free  rather  than  the  total  circulating 
plasma drug concentration. In chronic kidney or liver disease, protein 
binding  may  be  decreased  and  thus  drug  actions  increased.  In  some 
situations  (myocardial  infarction,  infection,  surgery),  acute  phase 
reactants transiently increase binding of some drugs and thus decrease 
efficacy.  These  changes  assume  the  greatest  clinical  importance  for 
drugs  that  are  highly  protein-bound  since  even  a  small  change  in 
protein binding can result in large changes in free drug; for example, a 
decrease in binding from 99 to 98% doubles the free drug concentration 
from 1 to 2%. For some drugs (e.g., phenytoin), monitoring free rather 
than total drug concentrations can be useful.

 ■ DRUG ELIMINATION
Drug elimination reduces the amount of drug in the body over time. 
An  important  approach  to  quantifying  this  reduction  is  to  consider 
that drug concentrations at the beginning and end of a time period are 
unchanged, and that a specific volume of the body has been “cleared” 
of the drug during that time period. This defines clearance as volume/
time. Clearance includes both drug metabolism and excretion.

Clinical Implications of Altered Clearance  While elimination 
half-life  determines  the  time  required  to  achieve  steady-state  plasma 
concentration (Css), the magnitude of that steady state is determined by 
clearance (Cl) and dose alone. For a drug administered as an intrave-
nous infusion, this relationship is:

Css = dosing rate/Cl  or  dosing rate = Cl • Css

When a drug is administered orally, the average plasma concentration 
within a dosing interval (Cavg,ss) replaces Css, and the dosage (dose per unit 
time) must be increased if bioavailability (F) is <100%:

Dose/time = Cl • Cavg,ss/F

Genetic  variants,  drug  interactions,  or  diseases  that  reduce  the 
activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes or excretory mechanisms lead 
to decreased clearance and, hence, a requirement for a downward dose 
adjustment  to  avoid  toxicity.  Conversely,  some  drug  interactions  and 
genetic  variants  increase  the  function  of  drug  elimination  pathways, 
and hence, increased drug dosage is necessary to maintain a therapeu-
tic effect.

 ■ ACTIVE DRUG METABOLITES
Metabolites  may  produce  effects  similar  to,  overlapping  with,  or  dis-
tinct from those of the parent drug. Accumulation of the major metab-
olite of procainamide, N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), likely accounts 
for marked QT prolongation and torsades de pointes ventricular tachy-
cardia (Chap. 252) during therapy with procainamide. Neurotoxicity 
during  therapy  with  the  opioid  analgesic  meperidine  is  likely  due  to 
accumulation of normeperidine, especially in renal disease.

Prodrugs are inactive compounds that require metabolism to gener-
ate active metabolites that mediate the drug effects. Examples include 
many  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors,  the  angi-
otensin  receptor  blocker  losartan,  the  antineoplastic  irinotecan,  the 
antiestrogen tamoxifen, the analgesic codeine (whose active metabolite 
morphine probably underlies the opioid effect during codeine admin-
istration), and the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel. Drug metabolism has 
also  been  implicated  in  bioactivation  of  procarcinogens  and  in  the 
generation  of  reactive  metabolites  that  mediate  certain  ADRs  (e.g., 
acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, discussed below).

 ■ THE CONCEPT OF HIGH-RISK 
PHARMACOKINETICS
When  plasma  concentrations  of  active  drug  depend  exclusively  on  a 
single metabolic pathway, any condition that inhibits that pathway (be it 
disease related, genetic, or due to a drug interaction) can lead to dramatic 
changes in drug concentrations and marked variability in drug action. 
Two mechanisms can generate highly variable drug concentrations and 
effects through such “high-risk pharmacokinetics.” First, variability in 
bioactivation of a prodrug can lead to striking variability in drug action; 
examples include decreased CYP2D6 activity, which prevents analgesia

by  codeine,  and  decreased  CYP2C19  activity,  which  reduces  the 
antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel. The second setting is drug elimination 
that relies on a single pathway. In this case, inhibition of the elimination 
pathway  by  genetic  variants  or  by  administration  of  inhibiting  drugs 
leads  to  marked  elevation  of  drug  concentration  and,  for  drugs  with 
a narrow therapeutic window, an increased likelihood of dose-related 
toxicity.  The  active  S-enantiomer  of  the  anticoagulant  warfarin  is 
eliminated  by  CYP2C9,  and  co-administration  of  amiodarone  or 
phenytoin,  CYP2C9  inhibitors,  may  therefore  increase  the  risk  of 
bleeding unless the dose is decreased. When drugs undergo elimination 
by multiple-drug metabolizing or excretory pathways, absence of one 
pathway  (due  to  a  genetic  variant  or  drug  interaction)  is  much  less 
likely to have a large impact on drug concentrations or drug actions.
 ■ PRINCIPLES OF PHARMACODYNAMICS
Time Course of Drug Action  Pharmacokinetic parameters, such 
as half-life and clearance, explain drug concentrations over time, but 
understanding  the  action  of  a  drug  over  time  (pharmacodynamics) 
often  requires  an  understanding  of  its  precise  mechanism  of  action. 
Drugs  act  through  interactions  with  drug  targets,  often  in  specific 
tissues,  and  with  a  cascade  of  downstream  consequences.  For  drugs 
used  in  the  urgent  treatment  of  acute  symptoms,  little  or  no  delay 
is  anticipated  (or  desired)  between  the  administration  of  the  drug, 
the  drug-target  interaction,  and  the  development  of  a  clinical  effect. 
Examples of such acute situations include vascular thrombosis, shock, 
or status epilepticus.

For  many  conditions,  however,  the  indication  for  therapy  is  less 
urgent, and a delay in the onset of action clinically acceptable. Delay 
can be due to pharmacokinetic mechanisms such as slow elimination 
(resulting in slow accumulation to steady state), slow uptake into the 
target tissue, or slow accumulation of active metabolites. A common 
pharmacodynamic  explanation  for  such  a  delay  is  the  biological 
mechanism of action. For example, the glucocorticoid prednisolone has 
a plasma half-life of about 60 min. The mechanism of action, however, 
involves  binding  of  the  glucocorticoid  receptor,  translocation  to  the 
cell nucleus, and alterations in gene transcription. These downstream 
effects  alter  immune  function  for  a  much  longer  time  frame,  as 
evidenced  by  the  biological  half-life  of  24–36  h.  Other  examples 
include proton pump inhibitors, which irreversibly bind the hydrogen/ 
potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme and thus affect acid secre-
tion  for  the  lifetime  of  that  enzyme,  and  the  irreversible  antiplatelet 
drugs, which exert effects for the duration of the life of the platelet.

Drug  Effects  May  Be  Disease  Specific  A  drug  may  produce 
no action or a different spectrum of actions in unaffected individuals 
compared  to  patients  with  underlying  disease.  Further,  concomitant 
disease  can  complicate  interpretation  of  response  to  drug  therapy, 
especially  ADRs.  For  example,  high  doses  of  anticonvulsants  such  as 
phenytoin  may  cause  neurologic  symptoms,  which  may  be  confused 
with the underlying neurologic disease. Similarly, increasing dyspnea 
in  a  patient  with  chronic  lung  disease  receiving  amiodarone  therapy 
could be due to the drug, underlying disease, or an intercurrent car-
diopulmonary problem. As a result, alternate antiarrhythmic therapies 
may be preferable in patients with chronic lung disease.

While drugs interact with specific molecular receptors, drug effects 
may vary over time, even if stable drug and metabolite concentrations 
are  maintained.  The  drug-receptor  interaction  occurs  in  a  complex 
biologic milieu that can vary to modulate the drug effect. For example, 
ion channel blockade by drugs, an important anticonvulsant and anti-
arrhythmic effect, is often modulated by membrane potential, itself a 
function of factors such as extracellular potassium or local ischemia. 
Receptors  may  be  up-  or  downregulated  by  disease  or  by  the  drug 
itself.  For  example,  β-adrenergic  blockers  upregulate  β-receptor  den-
sity during chronic therapy. While this effect does not usually result in 
resistance to the therapeutic effect of the drugs, it may produce severe 
agonist-mediated  effects  (such  as  hypertension  or  tachycardia)  if  the 
blocking drug is abruptly withdrawn.

As molecular mechanisms of disease become better defined, drugs 
targeting  those  mechanisms  are  being  introduced  into  practice. 

Antineoplastic agents targeting mutant kinases overexpressed in can-
cers (e.g., BRAF V600E in melanoma, hairy cell leukemia, and other 
malignancies) are revolutionizing cancer care. Ivacaftor was originally 
developed and marketed for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) carrying 
the G551D mutation in the disease gene CFTR (Chap. 291). While the 
most common CFTR mutations causing CF generate normal chloride 
channels  that  are  not  correctly  trafficked  to  the  cell  surface,  G551D 
channels are trafficked normally but do not conduct chloride correctly, 
and ivacaftor corrects this “gating” defect. Following initial marketing 
for  only  G551D  patients  (5%  of  all  CF  patients),  the  U.S.  Food  and 
Drug  Administration  (FDA)  approved  ivacaftor  for  use  in  patients 
carrying other CFTR mutations that confer gating defects corrected by 
ivacaftor in vitro.

 ■ PRINCIPLES OF DOSE SELECTION
The desired goal of therapy with any drug is to maximize the likelihood 
of a beneficial effect while minimizing the risk of ADRs. Previous expe-
rience with the drug, in controlled clinical trials or in postmarketing 
use,  defines  the  relationships  between  dose  or  plasma  concentration 
and these dual effects (Fig. 67-1) and has important implications for 
initiation of drug therapy:

1.  The  target  drug  effect  should  be  defined  when  drug  treatment  is 
started. With some drugs, the desired effect may be difficult to mea-
sure  objectively,  or  the  onset  of  efficacy  can  be  delayed  for  weeks 
or  months;  drugs  used  in  the  treatment  of  cancer  and  psychiatric 
disease are examples. Sometimes a drug is used to treat a symptom, 
such as pain or palpitations, and here it is the patient who will report 
whether the selected dose is effective. In yet other settings, such as 
anticoagulation or hypertension, the desired response can be repeat-
edly and objectively assessed by simple clinical or laboratory tests.
2.  The  nature  of  anticipated  toxicity  often  dictates  the  starting  dose.  If 
side effects are minor, it may be acceptable to start chronic therapy 
at  a  dose  highly  likely  to  achieve  efficacy  and  down-titrate  if  side 
effects occur. However, this approach is rarely, if ever, justified if the 
anticipated toxicity is serious or life-threatening; in this circumstance, 
it  is  more  appropriate  to  initiate  therapy  with  the  lowest  dose  that 
may produce a desired effect. In cancer chemotherapy, it is common 
practice to use maximally tolerated doses.

3.  The above considerations do not apply if these relationships between 
dose and effects cannot be defined. This is especially relevant to some 
ADRs (discussed further below) whose development is not readily 
related to drug dose.

4.  If a drug dose does not achieve its desired effect, a dosage increase is 
justified only if toxicity is absent and the likelihood of serious toxicity 
is small.

Failure  of  Efficacy  Even  assuming  the  diagnosis  is  correct  and 
the correct drug and dose are prescribed, drugs may fail to be effec-
tive  because  100%  efficacy  is  not  expected.  A  complete  therapeutic 
response is often absent with antihypertensive or antidepressant drugs, 
and  a  major  challenge  in  contemporary  therapeutics  is  to  identify 
patient-specific  predictors  of  response  to  individual  drugs.  Other 
explanations for failure of efficacy include drug interactions, noncom-
pliance, or unexpectedly low drug concentration due to administration 
of expired or degraded drug. These are situations in which measure-
ment of plasma drug concentrations, if available, can be especially use-
ful. Noncompliance is an especially frequent problem in the long-term 
treatment  of  diseases  such  as  hypertension  and  epilepsy,  occurring 
in ≥25% of patients in therapeutic environments in which no special 
effort  is  made  to  involve  patients  in  the  responsibility  for  their  own 
health. Multidrug regimens with multiple doses per day are especially 
prone to noncompliance.

Monitoring  response  to  therapy,  by  physiologic  measures  or  by 
plasma  concentration  measurements,  requires  an  understanding 
of  the  relationships  between  plasma  concentration  and  anticipated 
effects.  For  example,  measurement  of  QT  interval  is  used  during 
treatment with sotalol or dofetilide to avoid marked QT prolongation 
that  can  herald  serious  arrhythmias.  In  this  setting,  evaluating  the

electrocardiogram at the time of anticipated peak plasma concentration 
and  effect  (e.g.,  1–2  h  postdose  at  steady  state)  is  most  appropriate. 
Maintained  high  vancomycin  levels  carry  a  risk  of  nephrotoxicity, 
so  dosages  should  be  adjusted  on  the  basis  of  plasma  concentrations 
measured at trough (predose). Similarly, for dose adjustment of other 
drugs (e.g., anticonvulsants), concentration should be measured at its 
lowest  during  the  dosing  interval,  just  prior  to  a  dose  at  steady  state 
(Fig. 67-4), to ensure a maintained therapeutic effect.

Concentration  of  Drugs  in  Plasma  as  a  Guide  to  Therapy  
Factors such as interactions with other drugs, disease-induced altera-
tions  in  elimination  and  distribution,  and  genetic  variation  in  drug 
disposition combine to yield a wide range of plasma levels in patients 
given the same dose. Hence, if a predictable relationship can be estab-
lished  between  plasma  drug  concentration  and  beneficial  or  adverse 
drug  effect,  measurement  of  plasma  levels  can  provide  a  valuable 
tool  to  guide  selection  of  an  optimal  dose,  especially  when  there  is 
a  narrow  range  between  the  plasma  levels  yielding  therapeutic  and 
adverse effects. Such therapeutic drug monitoring is commonly used 
with certain types of drugs including many anticonvulsants, antirejec-
tion  agents,  antiarrhythmics,  and  antibiotics.  By  contrast,  if  no  such 
relationship can be established (e.g., if drug access to important sites 
of action outside plasma is highly variable), monitoring plasma con-
centration may not provide an accurate guide to therapy (Fig. 67-5).

The  common  situation  of  first-order  elimination  implies  that 
average,  maximum,  and  minimum  steady-state  concentrations  are 
related linearly to the dosing rate. Accordingly, the maintenance dose 
may  be  adjusted  on  the  basis  of  the  ratio  between  the  desired  and 
measured  concentrations  at  steady  state;  for  example,  if  a  doubling 
of  the  steady-state  plasma  concentration  is  desired,  the  dose  should 
be  doubled.  This  does  not  apply  to  drugs  eliminated  by  zero-order 
kinetics  (fixed  amount  per  unit  time),  where  small  dosage  increases 
will  produce  disproportionate  increases  in  plasma  concentration; 
examples include phenytoin and theophylline.

If an increase in dosage is needed, this is usually best achieved by 
increasing  the  drug  dose  and  leaving  the  dosing  interval  constant 

(e.g.,  by  giving  200  mg  every  8  h  instead  of  100  mg  every  8  h). 
However,  this  approach  is  acceptable  only  if  the  resulting  maximum 
concentration is not toxic and the trough value does not fall below the 
minimum  effective  concentration  for  an  undesirable  period  of  time. 
Alternatively, the steady state may be changed by altering the frequency 
of intermittent dosing but not the size of each dose. In this case, the 
magnitude  of  the  fluctuations  around  the  average  steady-state  level 
will change—the shorter the dosing interval, the smaller the difference 
between peak and trough levels.

EFFECTS OF DISEASE ON DRUG 
CONCENTRATION AND RESPONSE
 ■ RENAL DISEASE
Renal excretion of parent drug and metabolites is generally accomplished 
by glomerular filtration and by specific drug transporters. If a drug or its 
metabolites are primarily excreted through the kidneys and increased 
drug  levels  are  associated  with  ADRs  (an  example  of  “high-risk 
pharmacokinetics” described above), drug dosages must be reduced in 
patients with renal dysfunction to avoid toxicity. The antiarrhythmics 
dofetilide and sotalol undergo predominant renal excretion and carry 
a  risk  of  QT  prolongation  and  arrhythmias  if  doses  are  not  reduced 
in renal disease. In end-stage renal disease, sotalol has been given as 
40 mg after dialysis (every second day), compared to the usual daily 
dose,  80–120  mg  every  12  h.  At  approved  doses,  the  anticoagulant 
edoxaban appears to be somewhat more effective in subjects with mild 
renal dysfunction, possibly reflecting higher drug levels. The narcotic 
analgesic meperidine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, so that 
renal failure has little effect on its plasma concentration. However, its 
metabolite, normeperidine, does undergo renal excretion, accumulates 
in renal failure, and probably accounts for the signs of CNS excitation, 
such as irritability, twitching, and seizures, that appear when multiple 
doses  of  meperidine  are  administered  to  patients  with  renal  disease. 
Protein  binding  of  some  drugs  (e.g.,  phenytoin)  may  be  altered  in 
uremia, so measuring free drug concentration may be desirable.

FIGURE 67-5  Drug concentrations in specific tissues may not always parallel those in plasma. For example, the 
efflux pump P-glycoprotein excludes drugs from the endothelium of capillaries in the brain and so constitutes a 
key element of the blood-brain barrier. Reduced P-glycoprotein function (e.g., due to drug interactions) can thus 
increase penetration of substrate drugs into the brain, even when plasma concentrations are unchanged.

In non-end-stage renal disease, changes in 
renal drug clearance are generally proportional 
to  those  in  creatinine  clearance,  which  may 
be  measured  directly  or  estimated  from  the 
serum creatinine. This estimate, coupled with 
the knowledge of how much drug is normally 
excreted renally versus nonrenally, allows an 
estimate  of  the  dose  adjustment  required. 
In  practice,  most  decisions  involving  dosing 
adjustment  in  patients  with  renal  failure 
use  published  recommended  adjustments 
in  dosage  or  dosing  interval  based  on  the 
severity  of  renal  dysfunction  indicated  by 
creatinine  clearance.  Any  such  modification 
of  dose  is  a  first  approximation  and  should 
be followed by plasma concentration data (if 
available) and clinical observation to further 
optimize therapy for the individual patient.

 ■ LIVER DISEASE
Standard  tests  of  liver  function  are  not 
useful  in  adjusting  doses  in  diseases  like 
hepatitis  or  cirrhosis.  First-pass  metabolism 
may  decrease,  leading  to  increased  oral 
bioavailability as a consequence of disrupted 
hepatocyte function, altered liver architecture, 
and portacaval shunts. The oral bioavailability 
for  high  first-pass  drugs  such  as  morphine, 
meperidine,  midazolam,  and  nifedipine  is 
almost  doubled  in  patients  with  cirrhosis, 
compared to those with normal liver function. 
Therefore,  the  size  of  the  oral  dose  of  such 
drugs should be reduced in this setting.

PART 3Pharmacology ■ HEART FAILURE AND SHOCK
Under  conditions  of  decreased  tissue  perfusion,  the  cardiac  output 
is  redistributed  to  preserve  blood  flow  to  the  heart  and  brain  at  the 
expense of other tissues (Chap. 257). As a result, drugs may be distrib-
uted into a smaller volume of distribution, higher drug concentrations 
will  be  present  in  the  plasma,  and  the  tissues  that  are  best  perfused 
(the brain and heart) will be exposed to these higher concentrations, 
resulting  in  increased  CNS  or  cardiac  effects.  In  addition,  decreased 
perfusion of the kidney and liver may impair drug clearance. Another 
consequence of severe heart failure is decreased gut perfusion, which 
may reduce drug absorption and thus lead to reduced or absent effects 
of orally administered therapies.

 ■ DRUG USE IN THE ELDERLY
In  the  elderly,  multiple  pathologies  and  medications  used  to  treat 
them  result  in  more  drug  interactions  and  ADRs.  Aging  also  results 
in changes in organ function, especially of the organs involved in drug 
disposition. Initial doses should be less than the usual adult dosage and 
should be increased slowly. The number of medications, and doses per 
day, should be kept as low as possible.

Even  in  the  absence  of  kidney  disease,  renal  clearance  may  be 
reduced  by  35–50%  in  elderly  patients.  Dosages  should  be  adjusted 
on the basis of creatinine clearance. Aging also results in a decrease in 
the size of, and blood flow to, the liver and possibly in the activity of 
hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes; accordingly, the hepatic clearance 
of some drugs is impaired in the elderly. As with liver disease (above), 
these changes are not readily predicted.

Elderly  patients  may  display  altered  drug  sensitivity.  Examples 
include increased analgesic effects of opioids, increased sedation from 
benzodiazepines  and  other  CNS  depressants,  and  increased  risk  of 
bleeding  while  receiving  anticoagulant  therapy,  even  when  clotting 
parameters  are  well  controlled.  Exaggerated  responses  to  cardiovas-
cular drugs are also common because of the impaired responsiveness 
of  normal  homeostatic  mechanisms.  Conversely,  the  elderly  display 
decreased sensitivity to β-adrenergic receptor blockers.

ADRs are especially common in the elderly because of altered phar-
macokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics,  the  frequent  use  of  multidrug 
regimens, and concomitant disease. For example, use of long half-life 
benzodiazepines is linked to the occurrence of hip fractures in elderly 
patients, perhaps reflecting both a risk of falls from these drugs (due 
to  increased  sedation)  and  the  increased  incidence  of  osteoporosis 
in  elderly  patients.  In  population  surveys  of  the  noninstitutionalized 
elderly, as many as 10% had at least one ADR in the previous year.

 ■ DRUG USE IN CHILDREN
Although there are very few pediatric-specific drugs, there are many 
pediatric-specific drug indications (e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin 
and  aspirin  for  Kawasaki  disease)  and  ADRs  (e.g.,  pyloric  stenosis 
after  erythromycin  exposure  in  infants).  Drug  metabolism  and  drug 
response pathways mature at different rates after birth, and the relative 
size  of  various  body  compartments  and  function  of  various  organs 
change  during  development.  There  is  increased  motivation  to  avoid 
organ  toxicity,  given  the  anticipated  long  post-drug-exposure  life 
expectancy. There are few studies providing empiric evidence to guide 
pediatric  dosing.  In  practice,  doses  are  adjusted  for  size  (weight  or 
body surface area) as a first approximation unless age-specific data are 
available. As in adults, the lowest doses anticipated to achieve clinical 
benefit are generally prescribed, potentially followed by titration.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DRUGS
Drug interactions can complicate therapy by increasing or decreasing 
the  action  of  a  drug;  interactions  may  be  based  on  changes  in  drug 
disposition or in drug response in the absence of changes in drug levels 
(Table 67-2). Interactions must be considered in the differential diagnosis 
of  any  unusual  response  occurring  during  drug  therapy.  Prescribers 
should recognize that patients often come to them with a legacy of drugs 
acquired  during  previous  medical  experiences,  often  with  multiple 
physicians  who  may  not  be  aware  of  all  the  patient’s  medications.  A 
meticulous  drug  history  should  list  all  medications,  including  agents

472 not often volunteered during questioning, such as OTC drugs, health 
food  supplements,  and  topical  agents  such  as  eye  drops.  Lists  of 
interactions are available from a number of electronic sources. While 
it is unrealistic to expect the practicing physician to memorize these, 
certain drugs consistently run the risk of generating interactions, often 
by  inhibiting  or  inducing  specific  drug  elimination  pathways;  these 
include CYP2D6, CYP3A, and P-glycoprotein inhibitors (Table 67-1) 
and CYP3A/P-glycoprotein inducers (Table 67-2). Accordingly, when 
these drugs are started or stopped, prescribers must be especially alert 
to the possibility of interactions.

ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS
The beneficial effects of drugs are coupled with the inescapable risk of 
untoward effects. The morbidity and mortality from these ADRs often 
present diagnostic problems because they can involve every organ and 
system of the body and may be mistaken for signs of underlying dis-
ease. In addition, some surveys have suggested that drug therapy for a 
range of chronic conditions such as psychiatric disease or hypertension 
does not achieve its desired goal in up to half of treated patients; thus, 
the most common “adverse” drug effect may be failure of efficacy.

ADRs can be classified in two broad groups. Type A reactions result 
from  exaggeration  of  an  intended  pharmacologic  action  of  the  drug, 
such as increased bleeding with anticoagulants or bone marrow sup-
pression  with  some  antineoplastics,  and  tend  to  be  dose-dependent. 
Type  B  reactions  result  from  toxic  effects  unrelated  to  the  intended 
pharmacologic  actions.  The  latter  effects  are  often  unanticipated 
(especially with new drugs) and frequently severe and may result from 
recognized  (often  immunologic)  as  well  as  previously  undescribed 
mechanisms. Type B reactions may occur at low dosages and are often 
termed dose-independent.

Drugs may increase the frequency of an event that is common in a 
general  population,  and  this  may  be  especially  difficult  to  recognize; 
an example is the increase in myocardial infarctions that was seen with 
the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib. Drugs can also cause rare and serious 
ADRs,  such  as  hematologic  abnormalities,  arrhythmias,  severe  skin 
reactions, or hepatic or renal dysfunction. Prior to regulatory approval 
and  marketing,  new  drugs  are  tested  in  relatively  few  patients  who 
tend to be less sick and to have fewer concomitant diseases than those 
patients who subsequently receive the drug therapeutically. Because of 
the relatively small number of patients studied in clinical trials and the 
selected nature of these patients, rare ADRs are generally not detected 
prior to a drug’s approval; indeed, if they are detected, the new drugs 
are generally not approved. Therefore, physicians need to be cautious 
in  the  prescription  of  new  drugs  and  alert  for  the  appearance  of 
previously unrecognized ADRs.

Elucidating  mechanisms  underlying  ADRs  can  assist  development 
of safer compounds or allow a patient subset at especially high risk to 
be excluded from drug exposure. National adverse reaction reporting 
systems, such as those operated by the FDA (suspected ADRs can be 
reported  online  at  http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/default.htm) 
and the Committee on Safety of Medicines in Great Britain, can prove 
useful. The publication or reporting of a newly recognized ADR can 
in a short time stimulate many similar such reports of reactions that 
previously had gone unrecognized.

Occasionally,  “adverse”  effects  may  be  exploited  to  develop  an 
entirely  new  indication  for  a  drug.  Unwanted  hair  growth  during 
minoxidil  treatment  of  severely  hypertensive  patients  led  to  develop-
ment of the drug for hair growth. Sildenafil was initially developed as an 
antianginal, but its effects to alleviate erectile dysfunction not only led 
to a new drug indication but also to increased understanding of the role 
of type 5 phosphodiesterase in erectile tissue. These examples further 
reinforce the concept that prescribers must remain vigilant to the pos-
sibility that unusual symptoms may reflect unappreciated drug effects.
Some  25–50%  of  patients  make  errors  in  self-administration  of 
prescribed  medicines, and  these errors can  be responsible for ADRs. 
Similarly, patients commit errors in taking OTC drugs by not reading 
or  following  prescribing  directions  on  the  containers.  Health  care 
providers must recognize that providing directions with prescriptions 
does not always guarantee compliance.

In hospitals, drugs are administered in a controlled setting, and patient 
compliance is, in general, ensured. Errors may occur nevertheless—the 
wrong  drug  or  dose  may  be  given  or  the  drug  may  be  given  to  the 
wrong  patient—and  improved  drug  distribution  and  administration 
systems should help with this problem.

 ■ SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
One  estimate  in  the  United  Kingdom  was  that  6.5%  of  all  hospital 
admissions are due to ADRs and that 2.3% of these patients (0.15%) 
died  as  a  result.  The  most  common  culprit  drugs  were  aspirin,  non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, warfarin, ACE inhibitors, 
antidepressants, opiates, digoxin, steroids, and clopidogrel. One study 
in the late 1990s suggested that ADRs were responsible for >100,000 
in-hospital deaths in the United States, making them the fourth to sixth 
most common cause of in-hospital death. Another study 10 years later 
showed no change in this trend.

In hospital, patients receive, on average, 10 different drugs during 
each hospitalization. The sicker the patient, the more drugs are given, 
and there is a corresponding increase in the likelihood of ADRs. When 
<6 different drugs are given to hospitalized patients, the probability of 
an  ADR  is  ∼5%,  but  if  >15  drugs  are  given,  the  probability  is  >40%. 
Serious  ADRs  are  also  well  recognized  with  “herbal”  remedies  and 
OTC  compounds;  examples  include  kava-associated  hepatotoxicity, 
L-tryptophan-associated  eosinophilia-myalgia,  and  phenylpropanola-
mine-associated stroke, each of which has caused fatalities.

 ■ TOXICITY UNRELATED TO A DRUG’S PRIMARY 
PHARMACOLOGIC ACTIVITY
Drugs or, more commonly, reactive metabolites generated by CYPs can 
covalently bind to tissue macromolecules (such as proteins or DNA) to 
cause tissue toxicity. Because of the reactive nature of these metabolites, 
covalent binding often occurs close to the site of production, typically 
the liver.

Acetaminophen  The most common cause of drug-induced hepa-
totoxicity is acetaminophen overdosage (Chap. 340). Normally, reac-
tive metabolites are detoxified by combining with hepatic glutathione. 
When glutathione becomes depleted, the metabolites bind instead to 
hepatic protein, with resultant hepatocyte damage. The hepatic necrosis 
produced by the ingestion of acetaminophen can be prevented or atten-
uated by the administration of substances such as N-acetylcysteine that 
reduce the binding of electrophilic metabolites to hepatic proteins. The 
risk of acetaminophen-related hepatic necrosis is increased in patients 
receiving drugs such as phenobarbital or phenytoin, which increase the 
rate of drug metabolism, or ethanol, which exhausts glutathione stores. 
Such toxicity has even occurred with therapeutic dosages, so patients 
at risk through these mechanisms should be warned.

Immunologic Reactions  Most pharmacologic agents are haptens, 
small molecules with low molecular weights (<2000) that are therefore 
poor immunogens. Generation of an immune response to a drug there-
fore often requires in vivo activation and covalent linkage to protein, 
carbohydrate, or nucleic acid.

Drug stimulation of antibody production may mediate tissue injury 
by  several  mechanisms.  The  antibody  may  attack  the  drug  when 
the  drug  is  covalently  attached  to  a  cell  and  thereby  destroy  the  cell. 
This occurs in penicillin-induced hemolytic anemia. Antibody-drug- 
antigen  complexes  may  be  passively  adsorbed  by  a  bystander  cell, 
which  is  then  destroyed  by  activation  of  complement;  this  occurs  in 
quinine- and quinidine-induced thrombocytopenia. Heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia arises when antibodies against complexes of platelet 
factor 4 peptide and heparin generate immune complexes that activate 
platelets; thus, the thrombocytopenia is accompanied by “paradoxical” 
thrombosis  and  is  treated  with  thrombin  inhibitors.  Drugs  or  their 
reactive metabolites may alter a host tissue, rendering it antigenic and 
eliciting  autoantibodies.  For  example,  hydralazine  and  procainamide 
(or  their  reactive  metabolites)  can  chemically  alter  nuclear  material, 
stimulating  the  formation  of  antinuclear  antibodies  and  occasionally 
causing  lupus  erythematosus.  Drug-induced  pure  red  cell  aplasia 
(Chap. 102) is due to an immune-based drug reaction.

Serum  sickness  (Chap.  352)  results  from  the  deposition  of  circu-
lating drug-antibody complexes on endothelial surfaces. Complement 
activation  occurs,  chemotactic  factors  are  generated  locally,  and  an 
inflammatory  response  develops  at  the  site  of  complex  entrapment. 
Arthralgias, urticaria, lymphadenopathy, glomerulonephritis, or cereb-
ritis may result. Foreign proteins (vaccines, streptokinase, therapeutic 
antibodies) and antibiotics are common causes. Many drugs, particu-
larly antimicrobial agents, ACE inhibitors, and aspirin, can elicit ana-
phylaxis with production of IgE, which binds to mast cell membranes. 
Contact with a drug antigen initiates a series of biochemical events in 
the mast cell and results in the release of mediators that can produce 
the characteristic urticaria, wheezing, flushing, rhinorrhea, and (occa-
sionally) hypotension.

Drugs  may  also  elicit  cell-mediated  immune  responses.  One  seri-
ous reaction is Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(SJS/TEN), which can result in death due to T-cell-mediated massive 
skin sloughing. Another probable immune-mediated drug reaction is 
the DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) 
syndrome, a rare ADR with a chronic relapsing course, often triggered 
by  antiseizure  medications  and  possibly  arising  from  herpes  virus 
reactivation. As described in Chap. 68, specific genetic variants appear 
necessary but not sufficient to elicit SJS/TEN or DRESS.

While the use of antibodies targeting immune checkpoints is dra-
matically improving prognosis in many cancers, these agents have also 
been  associated  with  the  unpredictable  development  of  many  appar-
ently immune-related ADRs. Some, like colitis or thyroiditis, may be 
self-limited or medically manageable, while others, notably myocardi-
tis, are rarer but can be rapidly fatal.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF ADVERSE DRUG 
REACTIONS
The manifestations of drug-induced diseases frequently resemble those 
of other diseases, and a given set of manifestations may be produced 
by different and dissimilar drugs. Recognition of the role of a drug or 
drugs  in  an  illness  depends  on  appreciation  of  the  possible  ADRs  to 
drugs  in  any  disease,  on  identification  of  the  temporal  relationship 
between drug administration and development of the illness, and on 
familiarity with the common manifestations of the drugs.

A suspected ADR developing after introduction of a new drug nat-
urally implicates that drug; however, it is also important to remember 
that a drug interaction may be responsible. Thus, for example, a patient 
on a chronic stable warfarin dose may develop a bleeding complication 
after introduction of amiodarone; this does not reflect a direct reaction 
to  amiodarone  but  rather  its  effect  to  inhibit  warfarin  metabolism. 
Many associations between particular drugs and specific reactions have 
been described, but there is always a “first time” for a novel association, 
and  any  drug  should  be  suspected  of  causing  an  ADR  if  the  clinical 
setting is appropriate.

Illness  related  to  a  drug’s  intended  pharmacologic  action  is  often 
more  easily  recognized  than  illness  attributable  to  immune  or  other 
mechanisms.

For  example,  side  effects  such  as  cardiac  arrhythmias  in  patients 
receiving digitalis, hypoglycemia in patients given insulin, or bleeding 
in patients receiving anticoagulants are more readily related to a spe-
cific drug than are symptoms such rash, which may be caused by many 
drugs  or  by  other  factors.  Drug  fever  often  escapes  initial  diagnosis 
because fever is such a common manifestation of disease.

Electronic  listings  of  ADRs  can  be  useful.  However,  exhaustive 
compilations  often  provide  little  sense  of  perspective  in  terms  of 
frequency and seriousness, which can vary considerably among patients.
Eliciting a drug history from each patient is important for diagnosis. 
Attention  must  be  directed  to  OTC  drugs  and  herbal  preparations 
as  well  as  to  prescription  drugs.  Each  type  can  be  responsible  for 
ADRs,  and  adverse  interactions  may  occur  between  OTC  drugs  and 
prescribed drugs. Loss of efficacy of oral contraceptives or cyclosporine 
with  concurrent  use  of  St.  John’s  wort  (a  P-glycoprotein  inducer)  is 
an example (Table 67-2). In addition, it is common for patients to be 
cared for by several physicians, and duplicative, additive, antagonistic, 
or  synergistic  drug  combinations  may  therefore  be  administered  if 

the physicians are not aware of the patients’ drug histories. Electronic 
health records (EHRs) may help mitigate this problem, but only if all 
treating physicians use the same EHR system. Medications stopped for 
inefficacy or adverse effects should be documented to avoid pointless 
and potentially dangerous reexposure. A frequently overlooked source 
of additional drug exposure is topical therapy; for example, a patient 
complaining  of  bronchospasm  may  not  mention  that  an  ophthalmic 
beta  blocker  is  being  used  unless  specifically  asked.  A  history  of 
previous ADRs in patients is common. Since these patients have shown 
a  predisposition  to  drug-induced  illnesses,  such  a  history  should 
dictate added caution in prescribing new drugs.

Laboratory  studies  may  include  demonstration  of  serum  antibody 
in some persons with drug allergies involving cellular blood elements, 
as  in  agranulocytosis,  hemolytic  anemia,  and  thrombocytopenia.  For 
example,  both  quinine  and  quinidine  can  produce  platelet  aggluti-
nation  in  vitro  in  the  presence  of  complement  and  the  serum  from 
a patient who has developed thrombocytopenia following use of this 
drug.  Biochemical  abnormalities  such  as  G6PD  deficiency,  serum 
pseudocholinesterase level, or genotyping may also be useful in diag-
nosis, especially after an ADR has occurred in the patient or a family 
member (Chap. 68).

Once an ADR is suspected, discontinuation of the suspected drug 
followed by disappearance of the reaction is presumptive evidence of 
a  drug-induced  illness.  Confirming  evidence  may  be  sought  by  cau-
tiously  reintroducing  the  drug  and  seeing  if  the  reaction  reappears. 
However, that should be done only if confirmation would be useful in 
the future management of the patient. Because rechallenge does carry 
risks, it is generally avoided unless the suspected culprit drug is critical 
to the patient’s care. When the reaction is thought to be immunologic, 
challenge is generally avoided. With concentration-dependent ADRs, 
lowering the dosage may cause the reaction to disappear, and raising it 
may cause the reaction to reappear. Serious immunologically mediated 
ADRs  have  been  treated  with  high-dose  steroids;  other  immunosup-
pressive agents such as rituximab, infliximab, or mycophenolate mof-
etil; or plasmapheresis.

If the patient is receiving many drugs when an ADR is suspected, 
the  drugs  likeliest  to  be  responsible  can  usually  be  identified;  this 
should include both potential culprit agents as well as drugs that alter 
their elimination. All drugs may be discontinued at once or, if this is 
not practical, discontinued one at a time, starting with the ones most 
suspect, and the patient observed for signs of improvement. The time 
needed for a concentration-dependent ADR to disappear depends on 
the time required for the concentration to fall below the range associ-
ated with the ADR; that, in turn, depends on the initial blood level and 
on the rate of elimination or metabolism of the drug. Adverse effects 
of drugs with long half-lives or those not directly related to serum con-
centration may take a considerable time to disappear.

THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Drug therapy is an ancient feature of human culture. The first treat-
ments  were  plant  extracts  discovered  empirically  to  be  effective  for 
indications  like  fever,  pain,  or  breathlessness.  This  symptom-based 
empiric approach to drug development was supplanted in the twentieth 
century  by  identification  of  compounds  targeting  more  fundamental 
biologic processes, such as bacterial growth or elevated blood pressure. 
The term “magic bullet,” coined by Paul Ehrlich to describe the search 
for effective compounds for syphilis, captures the essence of the hope 
that understanding basic biologic processes will lead to highly effective 
new therapies.

A  common  starting  point  for  the  development  of  many  widely 
used  modern  therapies  has  been  basic  biologic  discovery  that  impli-
cates  potential  target  molecules:  examples  of  such  target  molecules 
include  HMG-CoA  reductase,  a  key  step  in  cholesterol  biosynthesis, 
or the BRAF V600E mutation that appears to drive the development 
of  some  malignant  melanomas  and  other  tumors.  The  development 
of  compounds  targeting  these  molecules  has  not  only  revolutionized 
treatment for diseases such as hypercholesterolemia or malignant mel-
anoma, but has also revealed new biologic features of disease. Thus, for 
example, initial spectacular successes with vemurafenib (which targets

BRAF V600E) were followed by near-universal tumor relapse, strongly 
suggesting that inhibition of this pathway alone would be insufficient 
for tumor control. This reasoning, in turn, supports a view that many 
complex diseases will not lend themselves to cure by targeting a sin-
gle  magic  bullet,  but  rather  single  drugs  or  combinations  that  attack 
multiple  pathways  whose  perturbation  results  in  disease.  The  use  of 
combination  therapy  in  settings  such  as  hypertension,  tuberculosis, 
HIV  infection,  and  many  cancers  highlights  the  potential  for  such  a 
“systems biology” view of drug therapy.

A  common  approach  in  contemporary  drug  development  is  to  start 
with a high-throughput screening procedure to identify “lead” chemical(s) 
modulating  the  activity  of  a  potential  drug  target.  The  next  step  is 
application  of  increasingly  sophisticated  medicinal  chemistry-based 
modification of the “lead” to develop compounds with specificity for 
the  chosen  target,  lack  of  “off-target”  effects,  and  pharmacokinetic 
properties suitable for human use (e.g., consistent bioavailability, long 
elimination half-life, and no high-risk pharmacokinetic features). Drug 
evaluation  in  human  subjects  then  proceeds  from  initial  safety  and 
tolerance (phase 1) to dose finding (phase 2) and then to large efficacy 
trials (phase 3). This is a very expensive process, and the vast majority 
of lead compounds fail at some point. Thus, new approaches to identify 
likely successes and failures early are needed. One idea, described fur-
ther in Chap. 68, is to use genomic and other high-throughput profil-
ing approaches not only to identify new drug targets but also to identify 
disease subsets for which drugs approved for other indications might 
be “repurposed,” thereby avoiding the costly development process.

SUMMARY
Modern clinical pharmacology aims to replace empiricism in the use 
of  drugs  with  therapy  based  on  in-depth  understanding  of  factors 
that determine an individual’s response to drug treatment. Molecular 
pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics,  genetics,  clinical  trials,  and  the 
educated  prescriber  all  contribute  to  this  process.  No  drug  response 
should  ever  be  termed idiosyncratic;  all  responses  have  a  mechanism 
whose understanding will help guide further therapy with that drug or 
successors. This rapidly expanding understanding of variability in drug 
actions makes the process of prescribing drugs increasingly daunting 
for  the  practitioner.  However,  fundamental  principles  should  guide 
this process:

•	 The benefits of drug therapy, however defined, should always out-

weigh the risk.

•	 The smallest dosage necessary to produce the desired effect should 

be used.

•	 The number of medications and doses per day should be minimized.
•	 Although the literature is rapidly expanding, accessing it is becom-
ing easier; electronic tools to search databases of literature and unbi-
ased opinion will become increasingly commonplace.

•	 Genetics play a role in determining variability in drug response and 

may become a part of clinical practice.

•	 EHR and pharmacy systems will increasingly incorporate prescrib-
ing  advice,  such  as  indicated  medications  not  used;  unindicated 
medications  being  prescribed;  and  potential  dosing  errors,  drug 
interactions, or genetically determined drug responses.

•	 Prescribers  should  be  particularly  wary  when  adding  or  stopping 
specific drugs that are especially liable to provoke interactions and 
adverse drug reactions.

•	 Prescribers should use only a limited number of drugs, with which 

they are thoroughly familiar.

68 Pharmacogenomics

Dan M. Roden

The  previous  chapter  discussed  mechanisms  underlying  variability 
in drug action, highlighting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
pathways to beneficial and adverse drug events. Work in the past sev-
eral decades has defined how genetic variation can play a prominent 
role  in  modulating  these  pathways.  Initial  studies  described  unusual 
drug  responses  due  to  single  genetic  variants  in  individual  subjects, 
defining  the  field  of  pharmacogenetics.  A  more  recent  view  extends 
this idea to multiple genetic variants across populations, and the term 
“pharmacogenomics” is often used. Understanding the role of genetic 
variation  in  drug  response  could  improve  the  use  of  current  drugs, 
avoid  drug  use  in  those  at  increased  risk  for  adverse  drug  reactions 
(ADRs), guide development of new drugs, and even be used as a lens 
through which to understand mechanisms of diseases themselves. This 
chapter will outline the principles of pharmacogenomics, the evidence 
as currently available that genetic factors play a role in variable drug 
actions, and areas of controversy and ongoing work.
 ■ PRINCIPLES OF GENETIC VARIATION AND DRUG 
RESPONSE (SEE ALSO CHAPS. 466 AND 467)
A  goal  of  traditional  Mendelian  genetics  is  to  identify  DNA  variants 
associated with a distinct phenotype in multiple related family mem-
bers (Chap. 467). However, it is unusual for a drug response phenotype 
to be accurately measured in more than one family member, let alone 
across  a  kindred.  Some  clinical  studies  have  examined  drug  dispo-
sition  traits  (such  as  urinary  drug  excretion  after  a  fixed  test  dose) 
in  twins  and  have,  in  some  instances,  shown  greater  concordance  in 
monozygotic compared to dizygotic pairs, supporting a genetic contri-
bution to the trait under study. However, in general, non-family-based 
approaches are usually used to identify and validate DNA variants con-
tributing to variable drug actions. Both candidate gene and genome-
wide  studies  have  been  used,  and  as  with  any  genomic  study,  results 
require replication before they should be accepted as valid.

Types  of  Genetic  Variants  Influencing  Drug  Response  
(Table 68-1)  The most common type of genetic variant is a single 
nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP),  and  nonsynonymous  SNPs  (i.e., 
those that alter primary amino acid sequence encoded by a gene) are a 
common cause of variant function in genes regulating drug responses, 
often  termed  pharmacogenes.  Small  insertions  and  deletions  can 
similarly alter protein function or lead to functionally important splice 
variation.  Examples  of  synonymous  coding  region  variants  altering 
pharmacogene  function  have  also  been  described;  the  postulated 
mechanism is an alteration in the rate of RNA translation, and hence in 
folding of the nascent protein. Variation in pharmacogene promoters 
has  been  described,  and  copy  number  variation  (gene  deletion  or 
multiple copies of the same gene) is also well described.

Table  68-1  lists  examples  of  individual  types  of  genomic  variation 
and the impact they can have on function of pharmacogenes. Multiple 
genotyping  approaches  may  be  needed  to  detect  important  variants; 
for example, SNP assays may fail to detect large gene duplications, and 
highly polymorphic regions (such as the major histocompatibility locus 
on chromosome 6 that includes multiple genes of the human leukocyte 
antigen [HLA] family) are currently best evaluated by sequencing.

example, rs1065852 is present in both *4 and *10 variants. See https://www.pharmvar.org/.

Table 68-1 also highlights the fact that the frequency of important 
variation across pharmacogenes can vary strikingly by ancestry, with 
the result that certain ethnic groups may be at unusually high risk of 
displaying variant response to specific drugs.

Candidate Gene Approaches  Most studies to date have used an 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms modulating drug action 
to  identify  candidate  genes  in  which  variants  could  explain  variable 
drug  responses.  One  very  common  scenario  is  that  variable  drug 
actions can be attributed to variability in plasma drug concentrations. 
When  plasma  drug  concentrations  vary  widely  (e.g.,  more  than  an 
order  of  magnitude),  especially  if  their  distribution  is  non-unimodal 
as  in  Fig.  68-1,  variants  in  single  genes  controlling  drug  concentra-
tions often contribute. In this case, the most obvious candidate genes 
are  those  responsible  for  drug  metabolism  and  elimination.  Other 
candidate  genes  are  those  encoding  the  target  molecules  with  which 
drugs  interact  to  produce  their  effects  or  molecules  modulating  that 
response, including those involved in disease pathogenesis.

Genome-Wide Association Studies  The field has also had some 
success with “unbiased” approaches such as genome-wide association 
(GWA) (Chap. 466), particularly in identifying single variants associ-
ated with high risk for certain forms of drug toxicity, and in validating 
the  results  of  candidate  gene  studies.  GWA  studies  have  identified 
variants in the HLA locus that are associated with high risk for severe 
skin  rashes  during  treatment  with  the  anticonvulsant  carbamazepine 
and hepatotoxicity with flucloxacillin, an antibiotic never marketed in 
the  United  States.  A  GWA  study  of  simvastatin-associated  myopathy 

identified a single noncoding SNP in SLCO1B1, encoding OATP1B1, 
a  drug  transporter  known  to  modulate  simvastatin  uptake  into  the 
liver,  which  accounts  for  60%  of  myopathy  risk.  African-American 
subjects are known to have higher dose requirements to achieve stable 
anticoagulation with warfarin, due in part to variations in CYP2C9 and 
VKORC1, discussed below. In addition, a GWA study identified novel 
SNPs near CYP2C9 that contribute to this effect in African Americans.

 ■ GENETIC VARIANTS AFFECTING 
PHARMACOKINETICS
Clinically  important  genetic  variants  have  been  described  in  multi-
ple  molecular  pathways  of  drug  disposition  (Table  68-2).  A  distinct 
multimodal  distribution  of  drug  disposition  (as  shown  in  Fig.  68-1) 
argues  for  a  predominant  effect  of  variants  in  a  single  gene  in  the 
metabolism  of  that  substrate.  Individuals  with  two  alleles  (variants) 
encoding for nonfunctional protein make up one group, often termed 
poor metabolizers (PM phenotype). For most genes, many variants can 
produce such a loss of function, and assessing whether they are on the 
same or different alleles (i.e., the diplotype) can complicate the use of 
genotyping  in  clinical  practice.  Furthermore,  some  variants  produce 
only partial loss of function, and the presence of more than one variant 
may be required to define a specific allele. Individuals with one func-
tional allele, or multiple reduction of function alleles, make up a second 
group (intermediate metabolizers) and may or may not be distinguish-
able  from  those  with  two  functional  alleles  (normal  metabolizers, 
sometimes  termed  extensive  metabolizers,  EMs).  Ultra-rapid  metabo-
lizers (UMs) with especially high enzymatic activity (occasionally due

with two loss-of-function CYP2D6 alleles (black), indicated by the intron-exon structures below the chart. Individuals with one or two functional alleles are grouped together 
as extensive metabolizers (EMs, blue). Also shown are ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs, red), with 2–12 functional copies of the gene, displaying the greatest enzyme activity. 
(Adapted from M-L Dahl et al: J Pharmacol Exp Ther 274:516, 1995.) B. These simulations show the predicted effects of CYP2D6 genotype on disposition of a substrate drug. 
With a single dose (left), there is an inverse “gene-dose” relationship between the number of active alleles and the areas under the time-concentration curves (smallest 
in UM subjects; highest in PM subjects); this indicates that clearance is greatest in UM subjects. In addition, elimination half-life is longest in PM subjects. The right panel 
shows that these single-dose differences are exaggerated during chronic therapy: steady-state concentration is much higher in PM subjects (decreased clearance), as is 
the time required to achieve steady state (longer elimination half-life).

to gene duplication; Table 68-1 and Fig. 68-1) have also been described 
for some traits. Many drugs in widespread use can inhibit specific drug 
disposition pathways (see Chap. 67, Table 67-1), and so EM individu-
als receiving such inhibitors can respond like PM patients (phenocopy-
ing).  Polymorphisms  in  genes  encoding  drug  uptake  or  drug  efflux 
transporters may be other contributors to variability in drug delivery 
to target sites and, hence, in drug effects.
CYP3A  Members of the CYP3A family (CYP3A4, CYP3A5) metab-
olize the greatest number of drugs in therapeutic use. CYP3A4 activity 
is highly variable (up to an order of magnitude) among individuals, but 
nonsynonymous coding region polymorphisms (those that change the 
encoded amino acid) are rare. Thus, the underlying mechanism likely 
reflects genetic variation in regulatory regions.

Most  subjects  of  European  or  Asian  origin  carry  a  polymorphism 
that disrupts splicing in the closely related CYP3A5 gene. As a result, 
these individuals display reduced CYP3A5 activity, whereas CYP3A5 
activity tends to be greater in subjects of African origin. Decreased effi-
cacy of the antirejection agent tacrolimus in subjects of African origin 
has been attributed to more rapid CYP3A5-mediated elimination, and 
a lower risk of vincristine-associated neuropathy has been reported in 
CYP3A5 “expressers.”

CYP2D6  CYP2D6 is second to CYP3A4 in the number of commonly 
used  drugs  that  it  metabolizes.  CYP2D6  activity  is  polymorphically 
distributed, and 5–10% of European- and African-derived populations 

(but few Asians) display the PM phenotype (Fig. 68-1). Dozens of loss-
of-function variants in CYP2D6 have been described; the PM phenotype 
arises  in  individuals  with  two  such  alleles.  In  addition,  UMs  with 
multiple functional copies of CYP2D6 have been identified especially in 
East Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania. PMs have slower elimination 
rates  and  lower  clearance  of  substrate  drugs;  as  a  consequence  
(Fig. 68-1B), steady-state concentrations are higher and the time taken 
to  achieve  steady  state  is  longer  than  in  EMs  (Chap. 67).  Conversely, 
UMs display very low steady-state parent drug concentrations and an 
abbreviated time to steady state.

Codeine  is  biotransformed  by  CYP2D6  to  the  potent  active 
metabolite morphine, so its effects are blunted in PMs and exaggerated 
in UMs. Deaths due to respiratory depression in children given codeine 
after tonsillectomy have been attributed to the UM trait, and the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has revised the package insert to 
include a prominent “black box” warning against its use in this setting, 
and, in fact, forbidding its use in children less than 12 years old. In the 
case of drugs with beta-blocking properties metabolized by CYP2D6, 
greater signs of beta blockade (e.g., bronchospasm, bradycardia) have 
been  reported  in  PM  subjects  than  in  EMs.  This  can  be  seen  not 
only  with  orally  administered  beta  blockers  such  as  metoprolol  and 
carvedilol,  but  also  with  ophthalmic  timolol  and  with  the  sodium 
channel–blocking  antiarrhythmic  propafenone,  a  CYP2D6  substrate 
with beta-blocking properties. UMs may require very high dosages of 
nortriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants to achieve a therapeutic

effect.  Tamoxifen  undergoes  CYP2D6-mediated  biotransformation 
to  an  active  metabolite,  so  its  efficacy  may  be  in  part  related  to  this 
polymorphism. In addition, the widespread use of selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to treat tamoxifen-related hot flashes may 
also alter the drug’s effects because many SSRIs, notably fluoxetine and 
paroxetine, are also CYP2D6 inhibitors (Table 67-2).

CYP2C19  The  PM  phenotype  for  CYP2C19  is  common  (20%) 
among  Asians  and  rarer  (2–3%)  in  other  populations;  the  frequency 
of  the  PM  trait  is  especially  high  (>50%)  in  Oceania.  The  impact  of 
polymorphic CYP2C19-mediated metabolism has been demonstrated 
with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, where ulcer cure rates with 
“standard” dosages were much lower in EM patients (29%) than in PMs 
(100%).  Thus,  understanding  the  importance  of  this  polymorphism 
would  have  been  important  in  developing  the  drug,  and  knowing 
a  patient’s  CYP2C19  genotype  could  improve  therapy.  CYP2C19  is 
responsible for bioactivation of the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel, and 
several large retrospective, and more recently prospective, studies have 
documented decreased efficacy (e.g., increased myocardial infarction 
after  placement  of  coronary  stents  or  increased  stroke  or  transient 
ischemic  attacks)  among  subjects  with  one  or  two  reductions  of 
function  alleles.  In  addition,  some  studies  suggest  that  omeprazole 
and  possibly  other  proton  pump  inhibitors  phenocopy  this  effect  by 
inhibiting CYP2C19.

CYP2C9  There are common variants in CYP2C9 that encode pro-
teins with reduction or loss of catalytic function. These variant alleles 
are  associated  with  increased  rates  of  neurologic  complications  with 
phenytoin,  hypoglycemia  with  glipizide,  and  reduced  warfarin  dose 
required to maintain stable anticoagulation. Rare patients homozygous 
for loss-of-function alleles may require very low warfarin dosages. Up 
to  50%  of  the  variability  in  steady-state  warfarin  dose  requirement 
is  attributable  to  polymorphisms  in  CYP2C9  and  in  the  promoter  of 
VKORC1, which encodes the warfarin target with lesser contributions 
by  genes  such  as  CYP4F2  controlling  vitamin  K  metabolism.  The 
angiotensin receptor blocker losartan is a prodrug that is bioactivated 
by CYP2C9; as a result, PMs and those receiving inhibitor drugs may 
display little response to therapy.

DPYD 
Individuals homozygous for loss-of-function alleles in dihy-
dropyrimidine  dehydrogenase,  encoded  by  DPYD,  are  at  increased 
risk for severe toxicity when exposed to the substrate anticancer drug 
5-fluorouracil  (5-FU),  as  well  as  to  capecitabine  and  tegafur,  which 
are metabolized to 5-FU. Dose reductions have been recommended in 
intermediate metabolizers.

Transferase  Variants  Thiopurine  S-methyltransferase  (TPMT) 
bioinactivates  the  antileukemic  drug  6-mercaptopurine  (6-MP), 
and  6-MP  is  itself  an  active  metabolite  of  the  immunosuppressive 
azathioprine.  Homozygotes  for  alleles  encoding  inactive  TPMT 
(1/300  individuals)  predictably  exhibit  severe  and  potentially  fatal 
pancytopenia on standard doses of azathioprine or 6-MP. On the other 
hand,  homozygotes  for  fully  functional  alleles  may  display  less  anti- 
inflammatory or antileukemic effect with standard doses of the drugs. 
GWA studies have also identified loss-of-function variants in NUDT15 
that  reduce  degradation  of  thiopurine  metabolites  and,  thereby,  also 
increase risk of excessive myelosuppression.

N-acetylation  is  accomplished  by  hepatic  N-acetyl  transferase 
(NAT),  which  represents  the  activity  of  two  genes,  NAT1  and  NAT2. 
Both  enzymes  transfer  an  acetyl  group  from  acetyl  coenzyme  A  to 
the drug; polymorphisms in NAT2 are thought to underlie individual 
differences  in  the  rate  at  which  drugs  are  acetylated  and  thus  define 
“rapid  acetylators”  and  “slow  acetylators.”  Slow  acetylators  make  up 
∼50% of European and African populations but are less common among 
East Asians. Slow acetylators have an increased incidence of the drug- 
induced lupus syndrome during procainamide and hydralazine therapy 
and of hepatitis with isoniazid.

Individuals homozygous for a common promoter polymorphism that 
reduces  transcription  of  uridine  diphosphate  glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT1A1)  have  benign  hyperbilirubinemia  (Gilbert’s  syndrome;  

Chap.  337).  This  variant  has  also  been  associated  with  diarrhea 
and  increased  bone  marrow  depression  with  the  antineoplastic 
prodrug irinotecan, whose active metabolite is normally detoxified by 
UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation. The antiretroviral atazanavir is a 
UGT1A1 inhibitor, and individuals with the Gilbert’s variant develop 
higher  bilirubin  levels  during  treatment.  While  this  is  benign,  the 
hyperbilirubinemia  can  complicate  clinical  care  because  it  may  raise 
the question of whether coexistent hepatic injury is present.

Transporter  Variants  The  risk  for  myotoxicity  with  simvastatin 
and possibly other statins appears increased with variants in SLCO1B1. 
Variants in ABCB1, encoding the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, 
may  increase  digoxin  toxicity.  Variants  in  the  uptake  transporters 
MATE1  and  MATE2  have  been  reported  to  modulate  metformin’s  
glucose-lowering activity.

 ■ GENETIC VARIANTS AFFECTING 
PHARMACODYNAMICS
A variant in the VKORC1 promoter, especially common in Asian sub-
jects  (Table  68-1),  reduces  transcriptional  activity  and  warfarin  dose 
requirement. Multiple polymorphisms identified in the β2-adrenergic 
receptor  appear  to  be  linked  to  specific  drug  responses  in  asthma 
and  congestive  heart  failure,  diseases  in  which  β2-receptor  function 
might  be  expected  to  determine  drug  response.  Polymorphisms  in  
the β2-receptor gene have also been associated with response to inhaled 
β2-receptor  agonists,  while  those  in  the  β1-adrenergic  receptor  gene 
have been associated with variability in heart rate slowing and blood 
pressure  lowering.  In  addition,  in  heart  failure,  the  arginine  allele  of 
the  common  β1-adrenergic  receptor  gene  polymorphism  R389G  has 
been associated with decreased mortality and decreased incidence of 
atrial fibrillation during treatment with the investigational beta blocker 
bucindolol.

Drugs  may  also  interact  with  genetic  pathways  of  disease  to  elicit  or 
exacerbate  symptoms  of  the  underlying  conditions.  In  the  porphyrias, 
CYP  inducers  are  thought  to  increase  the  activity  of  enzymes  proximal 
to the deficient enzyme, exacerbating or triggering attacks (Chap. 416). 
Deficiency  of  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (G6PD),  most 
often  in  individuals  of  African,  Mediterranean,  or  South  Asian 
descent,  increases  the  risk  of  hemolytic  anemia  in  response  to  the 
antimalarial primaquine (Chap. 100) and the uric acid-lowering agent 
rasburicase, which does not cause hemolysis in patients with normal 
amounts  of  the  enzyme.  Patients  with  mutations  in  RYR1  encoding 
the  skeletal  muscle  intracellular  release  calcium  (also  termed  type 
1  ryanodine  receptor)  are  asymptomatic  until  exposed  to  certain 
general anesthetics, which can trigger the rare syndrome of malignant 
hyperthermia.  Certain  antiarrhythmics  and  other  drugs  can  produce 
marked QT prolongation and torsades de pointes (Chap. 246), and in a 
minority of affected patients, this adverse effect represents unmasking 
of previously subclinical congenital long QT syndrome.

Immunologically  Mediated  Drug  Reactions  The  Stevens-
Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a potentially 
fatal  skin  and  systemic  reaction  now  increasingly  recognized  to  be 
linked  to  specific  HLA  alleles  (Table  68-2).  Cases  of  drug-induced 
hepatotoxicity  and  of  the  drug  rash  with  eosinophilia  and  systemic 
symptoms  (DRESS)  syndrome  have  also  been  linked  to  variants  in 
this  region.  The  frequency  of  risk  alleles  often  varies  by  ancestry  
(Table  68-1).  The  HLA  risk  alleles  appear  to  be  necessary  but  not 
sufficient to elicit these reactions. For example, HLA-B*57:01 is a risk 
allele  for  abacavir-related  SJS/TEN  and  flucloxacillin-related  hepato-
toxicity. However, while 55% of abacavir-exposed subjects will develop 
a  reaction,  only  1/10,000  subjects  exposed  to  flucloxacillin  develop 
hepatotoxicity.  Thus,  a  third  factor,  the  nature  of  which  has  not  yet 
been established, seems necessary.

Tumor  and  Infectious  Agent  Genomes  The  actions  of  drugs 
used  to  treat  infectious  or  neoplastic  disease  may  be  modulated  by 
variants in these nonhuman germline genomes. Genotyping tumors is a 
rapidly evolving approach to target therapies to underlying mechanisms 
and  to  avoid  potentially  toxic  therapy  in  patients  who  would  derive

no benefit (Chap. 71). Trastuzumab, which potentiates anthracycline- 
related cardiotoxicity, is ineffective in breast cancers that do not express 
the  Herceptin  receptor.  Imatinib  targets  a  specific  tyrosine  kinase, 
BCR-Abl1,  that  is  generated  by  the  translocation  that  creates  the  
Philadelphia  chromosome  typical  of  chronic  myelogenous  leukemia 
(CML).  Imatinib  is  also  an  inhibitor  of  another  kinase,  c-kit,  and 
the  drug  is  remarkably  effective  in  c-kit-driven  cancer,  such  as 
gastrointestinal  stromal  tumors  (Chap.  71).  Vemurafenib  does  not 
inhibit wild-type BRAF but is active against the V600E mutant form of 
the kinase. Crizotinib is highly effective in non-small cell lung cancers 
harboring anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations.

 ■ INCORPORATING PHARMACOGENETIC 
INFORMATION INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The  discovery  of  common  variant  alleles  with  relatively  large  effects 
on drug response raises the prospect that these variants could be used 
to guide therapy. Desired outcomes could be better ways of choosing 
likely  effective  drugs  and  dosages,  or  avoiding  drugs  that  are  likely 
to produce severe adverse drug events or be ineffective in individual 
subjects. Indeed, the FDA now incorporates pharmacogenetic data into 
package inserts meant to guide prescribing. A decision to adopt phar-
macogenetically guided dosing for a given drug depends on multiple 
factors. The most important are the magnitude and clinical importance 
of the genetic effect and the strength of evidence linking genetic varia-
tion to variable drug effects (e.g., anecdote versus post-hoc analysis of 
clinical trial data versus randomized clinical trial [RCT]). The evidence 
can be strengthened if statistical arguments from clinical trial data are 
complemented by an understanding of underlying physiologic mecha-
nisms. Cost versus expected benefit may also be a factor.

Point of Care Versus Preemptive Approaches  Two approaches 
to  pharmacogenetic  implementation  have  been  put  in  place  at  “early 
adopter”  institutions  and  are  currently  being  evaluated.  In  the  first, 
variant-specific  assays  are  ordered  at  the  time  of  drug  prescription 
and  delivered  rapidly  (often  within  an  hour  or  two),  and  the  results 
are then used to guide therapy with that specific drug. The alternative 
to this “point-of-care” approach is a “preemptive” approach in which 
pharmacogenetic testing for large numbers of potential variants across 
many drugs is undertaken prior to prescription of any such drug. The 
data are then available in electronic health record (EHR) systems and 
coupled  to  real-time  clinical  decision  support  (CDS).  When  a  drug 
whose effects are known to be influenced by pharmacogenetic variants 
is prescribed, the EHR system looks up whether variants likely to affect 
response are present; if so, CDS will alert health care providers that an 
alternate drug or a different dose may be required.

Challenges  There are multiple challenges in putting in place either 
system.  Assay  validity  and  reproducibility  have  been  issues  in  the 
past, but are less likely now. National consortia are now being put in 
place to develop standards for pharmacogenetic CDS. While common 
variants in genes such as those listed in Table 68-1 have been clearly 
associated  with  variable  drug  responses,  the  effect  of  rare  variants, 
now readily discoverable by large-scale sequencing, is unknown. The 
extent to which a dose adjustment might be recommended may vary 
depending  on  whether  zero,  one,  or  two  variant  alleles  are  present, 
and whether such variants are reduction of function, loss of function, 
or  gain  of  function.  The  Clinical  Pharmacogenetics  Implementation 
Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group 
have developed and published guidelines for multiple drug-gene pairs 
focusing on the question of what might be an appropriate drug dose 
adjustment  given  the  availability  of  genetic  data.  These  resources  do 
not directly address the question of when or how such genetic testing 
should be undertaken.

Developing  Evidence  That  Pharmacogenetic  Testing  Alters 
Drug Outcomes  A major issue is whether pharmacogenetic test-
ing affects important drug response outcomes. When the evidence is 
compelling,  alternate  therapies  are  not  available,  and  there  are  clear 
recommendations  for  dosage  adjustment  in  subjects  with  variants, 
there is a strong argument for deploying genetic testing as a guide to 

prescribing; HLA-B*57:01 testing for abacavir is an example described 
below. In other situations, the arguments are less compelling: the mag-
nitude of the genetic effect may be smaller, the consequences may be 
less serious, alternate therapies may be available, or the drug effect may 
be amenable to monitoring by other approaches.

One school argues that the physiology and pharmacology are known 
and that RCTs are, therefore, unnecessary (and conceivably unethical). 
The analogy is sometimes drawn to well-recognized dose adjustment 
of  renally  excreted  drugs  in  the  presence  of  renal  dysfunction.  RCTs 
have  not  been  conducted  and  the  idea  of  such  dose  adjustment  is 
well accepted in the medical community and recommended in FDA- 
approved  drug  labels.  Others  have  argued  that  the  effect  of  genetic 
variants is generally modest and variability in drug actions has many 
nongenetic sources, so genetic testing might provide marginal benefit 
at best.

Efforts  to  demonstrate  the  value  of  pharmacogenetic  testing  have 
met with mixed results. An RCT clearly showed that HLA-B*57:01 test-
ing eliminates SJS/TEN due to abacavir. Similarly, regulatory author-
ities  in  some  countries  in  Southeast  Asia  mandated  HLA-B*15:02 
testing  prior  to  initiation  of  carbamazepine;  however,  in  this  case, 
an  unfortunate  outcome  in  some  jurisdictions  was  that  prescribers 
stopped  using  carbamazepine,  often  substituting  phenytoin  (another 
drug  associated  with  SJS/TEN),  so  the  incidence  of  the  severe  ADR 
was unchanged.

RCTs  evaluating  the  effect  of  using  pharmacogenetically  guided 
therapy to optimize warfarin treatment have shown either no effect or 
a modest benefit of incorporating genetic information into prescribing 
the drug. Initial RCTs focused on time in therapeutic range in the first 
4–12 weeks of treatment, whereas one more recent trial demonstrated 
that  genotype-guided  therapy  could  reduce  the  frequency  of  over- 
anticoagulation. Retrospective analyses of bleeding cases versus non-
bleeding controls in EHRs and administrative databases have suggested 
a role for CYP2C9*3 or for the V433M variant in CYP4F2 in mediating 
this risk.

Two  large  trials  have  randomized  patients  with  acute  coronary 
syndromes to newer antiplatelet therapies (ticagrelor or prasugrel) or 
clopidogrel if CYP2C19 variants were absent; in one, clopidogrel was 
superior, and in the second, a trend in the same direction, which did 
not reach the prespecified endpoint, was observed.

New  effective  alternate  therapies  to  warfarin  and  clopidogrel  that 
appear  to  lack  important  pharmacogenetic  variants  have  emerged. 
One approach to therapy, therefore, is to use pharmacogenetic testing 
to identify subjects in whom variants are absent and therefore standard 
doses of the conventional inexpensive drugs are likely to be effective 
and to reserve alternate more expensive therapies for subjects likely to 
have variant responses to warfarin or clopidogrel.

 ■ GENETICS AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT
Genetic  tools  are  now  being  increasingly  used  to  identify  or  validate 
new drug targets. Initial studies suggest that a new drug development 
program  is  more  likely  to  succeed  if  evidence  from  human  genetics 
supports the role of a possible drug target in disease pathogenesis and 
suggests that the risk of toxicity due to high-risk pharmacokinetics or 
other  mechanisms  is  small.  Furthermore,  studies  of  the  relationships 
between  variants  in  genes  encoding  drug  target  molecules  and  a 
range  of  phenotypes  (e.g.,  those  in  EHRs)  are  being  used  for  drug 
“repurposing,” identifying new indications for existing drugs.

Finding  Protective  Alleles  Can  Identify  Drug  Targets  One 
example  of  using  genetics  to  identify  a  new  drug  target  started  with 
the  discovery  that  very  rare  gain-of-function  variants  in  PCSK9  are  a 
rare  cause  of  familial  hypercholesterolemia.  Subsequently,  population 
studies  showed  that  carriers  of  loss-of-function  SNPs  (2.5%  of  African  
Americans)  had  decreased  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol, 
decreased  incidence  of  coronary  artery  disease,  and  no  deleterious 
consequences in other organ systems. These data triggered the devel-
opment  of  PCSK9  monoclonal  antibodies,  which  were  marketed  
<10  years  after  the  initial  population  studies.  Other  targets  impli-
cated  by  similar  population  genetic  studies  include  HSD17B13  for

prevention  of  chronic  liver  disease,  SLC30A8  for  the  prevention  of 
type 2 diabetes, and APOC3 for hypertriglyceridemia. Discovering rare 
protective alleles may require very large data sets (>100,000), such as 
EHR systems coupled to DNA biobanks or epidemiologic cohorts like 
the UK Biobank.

Cancer 
In  cancer,  tumor  sequencing  has  identified  new  targets 
for  drug  development,  often  constitutively  active  kinases.  A  problem 
in  this  area  has  been  the  rapid  emergence  of  drug  resistance,  often 
after  extraordinary  initial  responses.  For  example,  40%  of  melano-
mas  appear  to  be  driven  by  the  V600E  mutant  form  of  BRAF,  and 
the  specific  inhibitor  vemurafenib  can  produce  clinically  spectacular 
remission. However, durable responses are rare, and it is now apparent 
that combination therapy, often with inhibitors of the MEK pathway, 
can provide improved therapy. Another approach that is rapidly gain-
ing  wide  use  in  cancer  involves  drugs  that  reverse  immune  system 
inhibition (Chap. 73). In some patients, the release of this “brake” can 
provide durable remissions, whereas in others, severe adverse events, 
including  colitis,  pneumonitis,  and  myocarditis,  have  been  reported. 
Understanding the mechanisms underlying variability to these thera-
pies is a major emerging challenge in the field.

Using  Multiple  Data  Types  The  development  of  methods  to 
understand  associations  across  multiple  large  data  sets  is  another 
approach that is being explored in drug development. For example, a 
GWA study of risk of rheumatoid arthritis identified multiple risk loci, 
and many encode proteins that are known targets for intervention in 
the  disease.  Interestingly,  others  encode  proteins  that  are  targets  for 
drugs  used  in  other  conditions,  such  as  certain  cancers,  raising  the 
question of whether such drugs could be “repurposed” for rheumatoid 
arthritis.

While the field has, to date, focused on individual high effect size 
variants (that are often common in a population), newer approaches 
combining many (dozens to millions) common variants into polygenic 
risk  scores  to  predict  drug  responses  are  also  being  explored.  An 
extension of this approach is the broader issue of systems pharmacology, 
in  which  multiple  sources  of  data  are  used  to  identify  potential 
molecules or pathways that would be amenable to treatment, by new 

drugs or by existing agents, using analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, 
proteomic,  and  other  large  data  sets.  Similar  approaches  are  being 
developed to predict toxicity expected from targeting specific genes or 
disease pathways.

SUMMARY
The science of pharmacogenomics has evolved from isolated examples 
of rare adverse drug actions to a more comprehensive view of the role 
of  genetic  variation  in  mediating  the  effects  of  most  drugs.  Current 
principles include:

•	 Genetic  variants  with  an  important  effect  on  drug  actions  can  be 

common, and their frequencies often vary by ancestry.

•	 One common mechanism is modulation of drug concentrations.
•	 No  practitioner  can  be  expected  to  remember  all  variants  impor-
tant for all drugs. Electronic data systems can now be accessed to 
describe this information. Ultimately, this information will be used 
by linking individual pharmacogenetic data to smart EHR systems.
•	 Incorporating  genetic  approaches  into  drug  development  projects 
holds the promise of more rapid development of targeted, safe, and 
effective therapies.
